3.75/5  rDev -16.1%look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 3.75The appearance is a dark brown colored body with a two finger white foamy head that dies within thirty seconds, lacing tries to cling to the glass but slowly slides into the body. The smell is spicy yet somewhat has some sweet cherries, a little tartness comes through and some booziness. The taste is mainly spicy sweet booze, cherries become more of an undertone to the flavoring, big boozy aftertaste, and a dry spicy finish. On the palate, its about a medium to heavy, sturdy carbonation. ABV felt appropriate. Overall, it's a bit boozy, but over the years I've learned to accept it for what it is supposed to be. 617 charactersLone_Freighter, Jun 10, 2017

3.86/5  rDev -13.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4Pours a hazy dark brown with a slight creamy and foamy appearance.  A large tan head quickly dissipates.  The smell is of sweet malty molasses and sweet dried fruit.  Taste follows the nose and there is a bit of alcohol burn although it hides the alcohol well, but there is also moderate astringency.  Maybe it's the nature of Belgian beers but I'm not crazy about that yeasty soapy chalky quality.  Feels medium bodied and a bit tingly with medium carbonation.  Overall I'm not blown away and prefer St. Bernardus Abt 12. 522 charactersPlinyMeNow, Jun 03, 2017

4.79/5  rDev +7.2%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Look: Pours a light mahogany color with a billowing three finger, khaki head of foam that laces the glass exquisitely.
Aroma: On the nose, sweet milk chocolate, red figs, dates, fresh baked pretzels, soft caramel and some floral notes of yeast akin to banana and clove.
Taste: Docile notes of sugarplums and sweet figs coupled with milk chocolate and gentle caramel. The initial flavors are complemented by a backdrop of clove, vanilla, banana and black pepper on the finish. There is a clean, soothing alcohol profile to it as it warms, and pleasantly, slightly tart notes of tamarind and orange pith emerge as it begins to open up.
Feel: Full bodied and creamy. Not overtly heavy, but rich. Mid-heavy mouthfeel. Moderate carbonation. Very supple and smooth. 11.3% ABV is very well hidden, I've had 8% beers with heavier alcohol profiles.
Overall: Rochefort 10 is a velvety, silky Belgian Quad with rich flavors of candied red, fleshy fruits and milk chocolate with undertones of sweet, peppery, somewhat floral yeast on the finish. Although the flavor is rich, it is never unctuous, unduly sticky or cloying. The mouthfeel is exceptional and absolutely perfect for the style. Worth every penny.
Rating: [A] Outstanding. 4.79/5. 1,234 charactersBloodSoakedAleMug, May 29, 2017

The head was packed with bubbles and faded extremely slowly, leaving a creamy layer on top and nice spotty lacing.
Smells of malt, brown sugar, toffee, syrup, molasses, herbal notes, light peppery spices, dark fruit like cherry, raisin and plum, and then some mild booze like dark rum. Some peat moss and earthy notes come through late, along with more sugary sweetness, but overall this malt bomb smells really good.
Tastes starts off with bread crust, caramel, brown sugar and toasted grains, followed by dark fruit like raisin, cherry, plum and a rotting pear. The bready notes, yeast and peppery spices linger and bring out coriander or allspice, then shifts to dark rum and mild barnyard funk. Complex is an understatement, as this changes slightly with each sip with the one constant being malt dominant and tasty. It's got a kick, but it doesn't seem like an 11.30% ABV beer.
Mouthfeel is incredibly creamy and smooth, even with the alcohol burn and mild heat this brew manages to slide down easy. Very mellow carbonation, a medium to thick body and a nice balance of sweet and spicy make this a Belgian classic that finishes with peppery spices and a yeast driven chalky finish. Overall a really tasty and enjoyable slow sipper. 1,432 charactersCHickman, May 14, 2017

Thus it was time to start diving into the Belgian end of the pool... and just by reading reviews I knew I was going straight for the QUAD...why mess around right? 
I was nervous... but it took only one sip to be hooked! I loved the way it looked in the glass... dark ruby/brown with a beautiful head...mmm smells great.. a lot going on
A slow sipper, good mouth-feel... and man just one of these knocked me on my A**. Def going to share it with a special someone next time.

F: Medium-Full, typical Belgian carbonation, incredibly smooth and creamy.

Smell was faint raisin subtle fruity sweetness. Caramel even. Very pleasant, but the aroma was somewhat hard to detect, but its there.The alcohol smell took a slight precedence. Not a bad thing at all. It was not a cheap rubbing alcohol type smell whatsoever that i have found in some beers.  Thin lace on the glass as i drank it down.
Taste is just as you would expect from the smell. Very subtle caramel/ chocolate overtones with a nice balance of dark fruit. Not too strong, but you know its there. 
The finish is somewhat malty, but clear and clean, drinks like a fine wine almost.
Mouth feel is perfect. Well balanced and smooth. Mild carbonation. It all comes together just right. 
This beer is not to be consumed ice cold of course, but  I found it rather good at room temperature as well. Excellent to drink while having Long hookah smoke session.
Definitely a beer i woukd keep on hand at all times. 1,052 charactersMadmike05, Mar 30, 2017

Strong alcohol smell with raisins and plums.  Get sweet and tarty aromas.   The beer follows the nose pretty well.  Tastes like a whiskey with dark fruits infused.  The sweetness of the fruits helps hinder the bite of this high ABV.  Medium bodied and nice level of carbonation.  Overall this is a good beer just not my favorite style all the time.

4.29/5  rDev -4%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25I don't drink quads very often and the style is usually more boozy and more sweet than I prefer, but sometimes February in Minnesota seems like a good time for one, and this is supposed to be a paradigm, so...from a single into a Chimay chalice.  Pours a dark swampy brown with a little sediment sinking to the bottom, and a frothy khaki crown that has fairly good retention.  The nose is pretty amazing, with layers on layers of dark fruit, sweet and pungent spices, some dark chocolate and even some tannins.  Taste follows, but man, this is boozy and sweet...and there's some rum-like notes that I didn't get in the nose.  For the abv, the feel is probably spot on but...it's a little too much to be ideal for me.  I'm rating to style, on the whole, and I can see why this has so many fans.  It's a real treat, but for me it will be a rare one. 847 charactersTaybeh, Feb 27, 2017

Tastes incredible with booze at the forefront (whisky or bourbon), malts, raisins, molasses and sweet cherries.  Well carbonated, medium bodied, slightly astringent and finishes on the dry side.  Absolutely incredible beer. 427 charactersEMH73, Feb 19, 2017

L - vigorous fizzy head that dissipates in about 15 seconds. Mahogany brown, dark but clear.
S - booze, dried fruit, especially raisins, cherry, ripe apples, sugar.
T - Rum soaked cookies, bitter-sweet apples, lots of booze, medicinal, incredibly long finish.
F - medium body, very little carbonation despite the initial head.
O - Don't get me wrong, excellent brew, but the taste was a let down after an amazing aroma. Not as I remembered so perhaps its me, or perhaps the years have muted some of the flavor. Whatever the case, this one is for sipping, the alcohol is definitely there, and the flavors open up some as it sits. 706 charactersljdrinksbeer, Feb 16, 2017

The aroma notes of dark fruit and roasted. Gently marzipan In the background liqueur notes of alcohol.
The taste is precious notes of alcohol, resembling, liqueurs, tinctures. Later, dark fruit, marzipan.
Alcohol is slightly perceptible, is definitely a noble form, heats, adds character but does not reject. Saturation average towards the low, I definitely will reply. 415 charactersPlutonowyManiek, Feb 10, 2017

Aroma - plum, caramell, raisin, malts....amazing
Taste - follows the smell very well and has just the right amount of maltiness.
Feel - Smooth with the perfect amount of carbonation. 11.3% alcohol is hidden VERY well...

Wow, the alcohol is barking on this one. It goes down warm to the belly. But not in a bad way.  The first flavor is actually the nice caramel malts, toffee, bready yeasts, nuttiness, a little bit of candy bar like sugars....and with the alcohol and heavy malts, this one is very creamy--but then BAM, the sizzle of the carbonation hits the mouth with some spices, and the palate is suddenly electrified with effervescence and a lovely dry finish. And you immediately want another sip--which is dangerous at ABV. You definitely have to tell yourself to slow down. Enjoy. This one is a treat and distinctly potable. 755 charactersPundit_of_Potability, Jan 21, 2017

4.44/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A - Cloudy brown body, with orange highlights, short tan head fades out quickly, leaving a thin ring at the edge.  Visible carbonation keeps the beer moving minutes after the pour.  It is a fine looking beer.
S - Booze is out and proud, with hints of tea and toffee, a bit of sugar, and strong dark fruit, prunes and raisins.
T - The open is sweet, with a candy note.  Then comes a cherry hit, almonds and candied breads.  The middle closes with a move away, toward more straight bread flavors.  The close hits with some tea astringency that fades back into a long sweet dark bread note, molasses and brown sugar, that lingers.  As it warms, the sugars come forward, and the bread takes on more caramel.
M - Brisk carbonation keeps this from getting syrupy or cloying, but the heft is there, a bit of alcohol warmth, and a slightly drier close that also helps clear the palate.  This is one that has so many traps for the brewer, but the result walks that line and is delivers a nice, warm feel.
O - This is a profoundly well crafted brew, with depth in flavor and great feel.  At over 11%, it could be a boozy mess, but it is instead a measured, tasty, developed experience.  Another Belgian that shows just how good these styles can get. 1,243 charactersTsar_Riga, Jan 15, 2017

L- Pours a dark brown with a 1/4" tan head which dissipates quickly
S- Strong malt, grain, brown bread with a hint of spice, slight musty yeast notes
T- Slight licorice flavor moving into malty sweetness, semi bitter hops on the back... Yeast flavors give this a sharp but pleasant smoothness. Hints of roasted grains and brown bread are also present. 
F- A bit of sharp carbonation and a fair amount of alcohol heat... Not easy to hide the high ABV but far from hot... Creamy and smoother than it has a right to be.
O- This is a quintessential Quad... Big, bad and packs a wallop with both complex and subtle flavors. Do not drink this on an empty stomach. 708 charactersREDAMI, Nov 26, 2016

Delicious taste, great feel, and bottle is classy and stylish, just cool. Alcohol is a whopping 11.3% but it doesnt burn or be too harsh for me. I dont always like 9%++ beer. Chimay blue is like the perfect between average and high ABV% alcohol percentage. But yeah this beer is amazing, love it. Costs a lot and is premium high quality, I buy this every now and then, once or twice a year. 504 charactersmatuka123, Nov 17, 2016

LOOK:  Dark Brown Color.  Thick head.  Has clingy legs.
AROMA:  Brown Sugar, Cinnamon, Carmel, brown bread.
TASTE:  Sweet  creamy flavor, with some sour fruit mixed in.   Brown sugar, cinnamon.  A touch of Belgian Wang, but manageable.
FEEL:  Full Bodied and a little sticky.
A nicely crafted beer.

4.1/5  rDev -8.3%look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25I am doing a comparison this weekend between this brew and St. Bernardus Abt.12. I have been cellaring this for 4 years.
It poured a murky brown color with a thin head that kept a constant ring.
Good spices complexity in the nose. Mild aroma with notes of cocoa, licorice, hay, plums, vanilla, mild clove, raisins and cinnamon.
Flavor with notes of cocoa, lots of spices (cloves, white and black pepper, ginger), candi sugar, lemon drops, orange marmalade, cinnamon, coconut, raisins, roses, more caramel than molasses, green apple juice, wood and definitely rum. Dry aftertaste with a medium bitterness and a spicy lingering note.
Bordering full body with somewhat effervescent carbonation. Alcohol of 11.3% is felt but it is in harmony with the overall beer.
Spicy and very flavorful Belgian Dark Strong Ale. Compared to St. Bernardus and Westvleteren, I found this more spicy, sweet and boozy, but a tad less complex, especially on malt profile, missing the myriad of chocolate and dark fruit notes. This time the bald monk will take the trophy home, better said to the monastery. 1,083 charactersFLima, Oct 30, 2016

What a fantastic beer. In the quad style, this one rates up there with the best. Not as complex and mystical as westvleteren 12 (but what is!). Not quite as robust and strong as St. Bernardus 12. But this bad boy holds its own. Get it! 273 charactersMemphisSooner, Oct 30, 2016

Appearance: Deep, cloudy mahogany brown with a lush cap of tan foam and streaky lace.
Smell: Rich aroma of burnt caramel, toffee, rum soaked raisins, vanilla and cocoa.
Taste: Deep, dark fruit and malt with an ever present warming alcoholic prickle. Finishes surprisingly dry.

The smell is alluring, but difficult to nail down. The immediate hit is bubblegum, overripe grapes, and banana roasted in dark, brown sugar. As the beer settles, this opens up into a beautiful mix of both dark and light fruits - plums, figs, rummy raisins, orange peel, cherries, pears, and apples.
Complexity is only furthered on the tongue - that sweet, boozy fruit being chased by peppered toffee, clove, and coriander seed. A bite of crisp, yeasty breadiness rounds everything off wonderfully. 
Truly a mammoth beer. After finishing my glass, a satyr snatched up the empty bottle and pranced away into the forest. He was carrying a gold cauldron of effervescent, purple liquid on his back, and called himself the Spirit of Good Beers' Past. 858 charactersSargeMcCluck, Sep 08, 2016

Which is one of my issues: too much residual sweetness, fruitiness, yeastiness. They're not breaking new ground with it, it's kind of ho-hum/meh for me.
But again, it tastes exactly like it should. 377 charactersGeeL, Aug 23, 2016

Appearance: Dark brown and red and looks opaque until direct sunlight is behind it. Just a few tiny bubbles and particulates. Rocky, barely toffee colored head with a creamy and frothy off white top.
Aroma: Bready and yeasty plum and fig with caramel and bananas and sugary dates. Such a strong sugary yeasty smell with only a hint of alcohol.
Taste: Follows the aroma. Plum, fig, dates, yeast and bananas, toffee and caramel all mixed together with such a smooth sweetness.
Mouthfeel: Smooth smooth smooth. On the light side of full bodied, meaning it's not thick but just smooth and substantial. Leaves a light sugary slickness in the mouth and a little spice.
Overall: Damn good. As described, the aroma and taste are almost identical, but the aroma favors the spice and the taste favors the sweetness. 844 charactersRago, Aug 11, 2016

S: the aroma I sense Is both dark and light fruits, plums,raisins,fugues, green apples, other things I sense is honey, candied sugar,caramel and different spices. 
T&F: Starts of with a flavour of dark fruits,a malty feel in the background all the time, in the middle I get more of the sugary yeasty sweetness and in the finish I think the spices get a lot more room in the flavour. I get a very warming feel in the body almost right after the first sip. The aftertaste has very little bitterness,but still is lasting remarkably long and both have a sweetness and malt over it. 
O: this is a amazing beer.a flavour bomb in the right words. Probably one of the best quadruples that is. I enjoyed this to the last drop. 924 charactersOlaB, Aug 05, 2016

5/5  rDev +11.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Served in a Chimay chalice, it pours a deep, very dark brown, almost black. It forms a two finger head, brown and sudsy, with low retention. Very modest and passing lacing.
Assertive and rich bouquet. 
Huge dark fruits as in dates, figs, raisins and mainly plum, overripe apple, brown sugar, caramel, fruit liquor.
Simply magnificent.
Very expressive carbonation upfront. 
This is similar to Rochefort 8 in the way its alcohol is felt and the character of its balance. There is a strong liquor flavor that accompanies the rest of the flavors as a fine note, and throughout the beer some tamed bitterness is perceived at times, as a playful reminder of its masterful craft.
The flavors unveil themselves as a godly parade. 
Once more, dates, figs, raisins, lots of plum and overripe apple, brown sugar, caramel, fruit liquor.
Besides the notes presented in its bouquet, there is a bevy of new flavors found while tasting it: cinnamon, wood, a tad of pepper, clove, chocolate, cajeta, toffee, slight nut, vanilla, and a floral/herbal freshness accentuated by the liquor note. 
The finish is long, fresh and sweet, with a worthy complexity. 
Medium to light body, velvety, high carbonation. 
Incredibly complex and full of depth.
An unparalleled assertiveness and length to its overall flavor. 
What a finesse. 1,311 charactersdavidperez, Jul 27, 2016

4.45/5  rDev -0.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Appearance: Pours an opaque darker burnt sienna brown.  Pours with a great plume of victorian lace coloured head, dissipation is moderate, and settles into a great lace and surface froth.
Aromatics: I’ve never had a plum bread pudding before, but the first whiffs of this is exactly how I imagine it would smell. A combination of yeasty fresh bread mixed with caramelized plums/dates. There is also a dress earthy floral quality to its aroma as well.
Taste: Boom! this really packs a flavour punch. There is loads of dark fruits mingling with berries and a smooth sweetness with a bit of a spice kick to it at the end.  Sugar cane sweetness and remarkably little bitterness. There is a fairly robust boozy hit like a high quality rum or bourbon at the end - not too much, just enough to take those myriad of flavours home for a cozy nightcap.
Feel:  The carbonation is pretty bubbly even after sitting, that small tickle of bubbles joins a smooth chorus of dry warmth and a crisp refreshing snap to it’s medium-heavy weight body. There is a complexity to its feel that I don’t think I am experienced enough to comment on well, but if this is what real Trappists beer is all about - sign me up.
Overall:  Astounding. My first Trappist (and first quad) beer and it did not disappoint in its delivery. Extremely well put together, super complex but has all the selling points of a beer that truly stands out and sets a lofty benchmark that I am sure will undoubtedly be tough to compare as I look forward to my next Trappist and Quad for that matter. 1,557 charactersJonCorbett, Jul 24, 2016

Smells of raisin, plumb, fig, whole grain bread, and some sour yeast.
Taste is rich and complex with a mountain of malt and yeast.  It has rich flavors of dark fruit -plumb, fig, and elderberry - with bright carbonated notes of raspberry and sour apple. There is a constant malt presence that melds with all the flavors though caramel and molasses come through. It finishes dry like a fine wine leaving the multitude of flavors rolling around your mouth. 502 charactersChickenhawk9932, Jul 23, 2016

Appearance- Pours a deep dark brownish/plum. Massive head that does not care to recede; having a light tan tint. Opaque.
Smell- Honey like sweetness with dark fruit aromas of fig and raisins. Sweet ripe cherry fragrance underlying as well. 
Taste- Starts off quite mellow with a subtle and delicate sweetness, slowly picking up to a more rounding darker fruit taste. Prune and raisin fruit notes are most prominent. Hints of cherry add a slightly bit more off sweetness. Hints of vanilla help to round out any excess of sugar. Beer finishes smooth, with a bit of medicinal flavor, although still maintaining those fruit notes.
Mouthfeel- Heavy in body with active carbonation. Some alcohol burn.
Overall- An outstanding quad to be had! Possibly the best for the style. Complex, smooth, and filled with flavor, although not in excess of any one flavor. A beer to sip and enjoy for a fine occasion or celebration. 968 charactersPA-hunter, Jul 09, 2016

4.51/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Picked up a single 11.2 oz bottle at the Trig's Cellar 70 in Wausau. The bottling stamp states this one is good for another three or so years. Poured at cellar temperature into a tulip glass.
L: Pours a cola brown color with about two inches of light, frothy, khaki head that dissipates fairly quickly, leaving a faint film and ring that leaves mild lacing on the glass. Profuse visible carbonation at the edges where the light strikes through. A bit disconcerting is the fact that there was a substantial yeast sediment along the side of the bottle. Hoping that this one isn't infected.
S: I'm getting something of a red wine quality from the bouquet--there's a very slight sourness or vinegar that I'm hoping doesn't signify infection. There are some roasty and caramel malt notes coming across, along with a touch of clove and licorice. Raisin, plum, and warm alcohol are also present. Though I was expecting some of those banana bread Belgian yeast notes, I didn't really get any.
T: The moment of truth: did I buy an infected bottle, or not? Well, if this is infected, I'd take an infected one every time. Warm, rich flavors of roasty and caramel malts play against flavors of ripe plum and rum raisin. As the flavor moves to the middle, there is a growing banana bread and clove taste characteristic of the style: it's by no means overpowering, as it rubs up against the other rich malt and fruit flavors present. There is a touch of a red wine quality that develops in the middle and toward the back, though this is fairly indistinguishable from warming alcohol notes. The back end continues the deft balance of hops/malts/yeast, with the warming alcohol becoming more prominent but by no means distracting. In fact, it is remarkable how well this one conceals that high ABV. The spiciness (most clearly clove) culminates toward the close, with more of that banana, raisin, and plum being carried atop the malts.
F: Medium to full-bodied, this one has a really spectacular feel that sets it apart from similar beers. While this beer should feel heavy, syrupy, and boozy, it has a very light feel on the palate, aided in large part by an excellent level of carbonation. Again, you can feel the heft of this beer, but it glides beautifully through the palate.
O: I tried this one many years ago, at a time when I didn't appreciate Belgian quads, let alone most hoppy beers. I'm glad that I returned to it because it really is a special beer. I like to throw around the terms "complexity" and "balance," but this one truly delivers in those areas. The flavors are big without overwhelming or drowning out one another. And the feel on this one really is incredible. Impressive, to say the least, how well they hide that ABV: It gives you all the warmth without those sharp alcohol notes. This is a beer that is well-worth seeking out. 2,842 charactersDabblinWiscCraft, Jun 22, 2016

Appearance:  A two finger head was poured that reduced to a thin layer.  It is a dark crimson color with no vision of anything.  Looks like any other quad I've had before.
Smell:  Caramel, toffee, toasted, candy sugar, spicy Belgian yeast, figs, bananas, raisins, plums, dates, and nice warm alcohol.
Taste:  Anything I picked up in the aroma is the same with  my palate.  Tasty, delicious, nice warm alcohol, and slight bitterness.  Dangerous too at 11.3% alcohol.  Definitely took my time and let it warm up to enjoy those bold flavors.
Mouthfeel:  Smooth, warm boozy alcohol, a little sweet, a bit dry, light light bitterness, definitely a sipper, medium to full bodied but feels light, and medium carbonation.
Overall:  One of the best quads I've had and easily available at most stores.  Just surprised I never reviewed it, but saved it for another reviewing milestone.  I look forward to many more bottles of this in in the future.  Aged well after the last 2+ years too. 1,072 charactersFlounder57, Jun 14, 2016

4.75/5  rDev +6.3%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75I have been “aging” this guy for about 6 months (maybe the longest I have ever kept a beer) because I was too lazy to buy the proper glass to drink it out of and I was saving it for a special occasion. Now that I finally bought the proper glass let’s see if it lives up to the hype. This Belgian quad pours a dark brown color with a big frothy tan head. The smell is complex with some significant aromas of dark fruits and sugar with a hint of alcohol. The taste is also quite complex. There is quite a bit of plum, dates, burnt sugar, molasses, and a significant alcohol kick at the end, which isn’t surprising given that the beer is 11.3%. The body is pretty heavy. Still markedly less than a typical stout or porter, but heavier than most anything else. The spices are more toned down than others I’ve had of this style. Rather than ruin the beer, like it would for a less bold beer, the alcohol flavor actually enhances it and makes you feel like you are drinking some kind magical beer / fine liquor hybrid. Plus it has a very nice warming effect. This is a fantastic beer and really in a style that I appreciate. To me this definitely lives up to the hype. 1,172 charactersBierliebhaber3, Jun 12, 2016

Pours a cloudy dark brown color. The head is around three fingers high and lighter khaki in shade. It features a bubbly texture typical of a good Belgian...as well as the underwhelming duration of retention. Small patches of lacing stick to the glass.
This has a wonderfully malty smell. Malty, but NOT overbearingly sweet. There's a wonderful candied sugar note fluttering around, giving great nuance to the additional notes of pumpernickel bread, brown sugar, plums, apricots, peaches, cherries, and dark chocolate. It's a hair hoppier than other big-name quads, but it adds wonderful dimensions of tobacco and grass instead of an overbearing, imbalanced bite. Even my words utterly fail at describing just how complex this beer is, except they just did right now. Even better, the depth is delicate and perfectly balanced instead of scattershot.
It's every bit as complex as the aroma indicated. Some intense fruity notes open it up - lighter and stone fruits hit immediately (apples, pears, peaches, apricots), which then trail off into dark fruits around the middle (plums, raisins, figs). A heavy malt presence also fills out the mid-taste with some pumpernickel bread, candied sugar, salted caramel, and toffee. It ends with a one-two punch of light tobacco and a bit of booze. This is a fresher bottle than the one I initially reviewed - as such, both the hops and the alcohol are more assertive here. Nor is it as perfectly integrated as said older bottle. It's still wonderfully balanced considering how intense everything is.
The mouthfeel is very well carbonated, helping to fill the mouth with a dense chewiness. Despite the big feel, and the malty sweetness, it's almost as dry as a 6% Belgian blonde. That's the masterstroke of this beer. There's enough carbonation and enough hoppiness to cleanse the palate beautifully.
In my head, when Motorhead wrote "The King of Kings", they wrote it for this beer instead of Triple H. Make no mistake, this beer is a damn near 5/5 with a little bit of age on it.

Appearance:  Pours a huge frothy head of about two and a half fingers.  Khaki colored and lively atop a very dark walnut body with shines ruby when held up to the light. Maintains a nice cap throughout. The Oerbier man on the glass seems happy.  
Aroma:  Stone fruit, rosey peppery yeast, molasses, and candi sugar.  Textbook example.  Layers of malty, Trappist yeast goodness.  
Taste:  Hearty Christmas desert is the first thing that comes to mind here.  Candi sugar sweetness, light perfumy alcohol, rosey peppery yeast, plum/fig, dark bread, and molasses.  What separates this from the number 8 right off the bat is significantly maltier taste.  
Mf:  Full body with prickly but low carbonation.  Sweet and sticky with a warming feel (but not boozy).  A sipper, but one that you want to keep sipping. 
Overall:  A textbook example of the style and obviously a great beer overall.   Signature rosey peppery yeast, candi sugar, dark bread maltiness and stone fruit sweetness.  Not too sweet, very easy drinking for what it is, really.  Always worth revisiting and definitely worth trying if you’ve never had it. 1,247 charactersCowsandBeer, Jun 01, 2016

It's like all the colors of the rainbow were blended into one yet still remained distinct.  
Full texture with balancing carbonation.

5/5  rDev +11.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Rochefort 10 cellared 3 years
Pours a dark brown color with a fluffy, fizzy, two finger sized head.
Fantastic aromas of ripe sour cherries among rock sugar and roasted malts, very intense on the nose. Almost a little boozy, but amazingly well integrated into the decadent sweet aromas, balanced by old wood and toasted walnut shell. 
Has a very lively, bubbly carbonation, which makes the beer's heavy body unfold in a lighter manner on the tongue, also washing away its boozy peak, which is recognizable for just a split second, while leaving with a long lasting warmth down the throat. 
Cherries from the nose are amongst the flavors from the very beginning, entangled into toffee, licorice, dried wood bark and autumn leaves. Malts have a toasty richness in this, which is heavy on the tongue, opening up the palate perfectly to the sweeter flavors, and makes it possible to integrate its warm boozy note so perfectly well. Nuttiness mingles into the warming alcohol, producing a cola sweetness, calmed by old earth and toasty malts, while finishing with a bubbly mineralic tone and dried plums. 
I am blown away by this one, this tastes perfect. Love the dried, sugared, alcohol soaked cherry note, which blends into roasted, rich malts. All flavors are intense and well pronounced at the same time, creating an awesome balance, making it possible for the different components to pack such a huge punch. 1,412 charactersaleigator, May 23, 2016

A- Pours a beautiful, hazy, dark brown colour with a fizzy, off-white head that works down to a couple whispy patches fairly quickly. Not uncharacteristic for the style (in my experience) but still, not what I was expecting. Even without much of a head, this beer is still very much alive on the surface. Patches of carbonation seem to buzz around and head from the middle towards the edges of the glass. Very interesting to behold. "Legs" appear on the glass almost like that of a fine Scotch. 
S-  Dark, Ripe fruit and an assortment of spices. Touch of apples and a hint of dark chocolate. 
T-  Dark fruit and spices that fade away to a soft bitterness. Gets much more complex as it warms. What was minutes before just Dark fruit and spices turns into something that is woody and peppery. Insanely complex, absolutely beautiful. 
M- Mouthfeel is creamy and medium bodied. Moderate carbonation. 
O- I haven't had many Quads in my time but I can't imagine them being any better than Rochefort 10. Incredibly delicious while being complex enough to be very, very interesting. 1,108 charactersPorterPro125, May 17, 2016

A:  Pours a dark brown color with a tight, beige, one finger hear that sticks around nicely in my goblet. Active carbonation upon pouring, that settles down. Emptied the contents of my bottle so there is a good amount of sediment floating around. 4
S:  Following up a bottle of Rochefort 8. This one smells a touch sweeter and more ripened fruit. There's also more of an alcohol presence, but still not overly boozy. 4.25
T:  I'm getting all of the same ripe fruit flavors, but also some more sweeter dark fruit in this one. Some fig, prune, dark raisin, and I'm not getting much of the woody/nutty undertones that I got in the 8. 4.5
M:  Wonderfully creamy, yet pillowy soft mouthfeel with low carbonation. 4.75
D: This one as well is never too sweet, and never too boozy. It's insane how drinkable these Rochefort beers are. At over 11% the alcohol is hardly noticeable. Overall a highly drinkable beer with nice, sweet flavors. 4.5 971 charactersantott0523, May 08, 2016

4.44/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Pours a deep dark hazy brown with a two finger tan head that quickly dissipates. No lacing noted, but a thin tan film across the top of the beer with a thicker ring around the outside of the beer. 
Smell is full of aromas of brown sugar, raisins, plums, fallen apples. Noticeable sweetness in the nose with undertones of bitter chocolate and spice. 
Taste is initially marked by a prickly combination of the carbonation and alcohol. However that quickly fades to a strong malt forward flavor with  notes of caramel, brown sugar, raisins, overly ripe apples. Slightly sweet, not bitterness, but its not at all cloying or too much. The aftertaste is really what makes this though. All those flavors just longer on the pallet with this pleasant spicy peppery tingle on the tongue. Although you get the boozy notes initially you quickly forget them and don't realize the cumulative effect until you notice your entire face has warmed up. This beer is perfect for a cold winter night. 
Feel is surprisingly airy for the high ABV - medium carbonation gives it a crisp and light feel. However, it is in no way watery or too light, although crisp there is real depth to the feel. Very smooth, buttery and mellow.  
Overall this Quad is remarkable and world class as an exemplar of the style, of Trappist beer and on its own merits. Just amazing. The balance, lush feel, and complexity of flavors, all while being so incredibly drinkable and tasty is outstanding. Must try at least once for anyone who loves beer.

Every ale I've had from Rochefort is world class excellence.  Pours a murky mud water brown with flavors of caramel, butterscotch, dark fruit, and a noticeable vodka like alcohol note.  The flavors intensify at near room temperature and it just gets better.  A deep and profound ale. 361 charactersJordanlikesAles, May 01, 2016

A thick 2 finger khaki head remains for the entire session and provides abundant lacing on my glass. Sweet and dark fruits behind yeast and alcohol. Some toffee and spice. Flavor is of cinnamon raisin bread and toffee with yeasty notes and other spices. Wonderful dark fruits and caramel with just a hint of chocolate. Medium body with a soft carbonation. Easy drinking with some warmth. A remarkable Quad. 472 charactersRi0, May 01, 2016

4.76/5  rDev +6.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Appearance--What one would expect from a Quad-Trappist.  Murky-copper, defying light-penetration.  Like other quads of this style, there is an initial two-finger head, that swiftly settles, leaving what looks like something between a glass of wine and a few fingers of liquor.
Smell--Sweet aroma of dried fruit, but not as aggressively raisin-y or fig-y as others of this style.  Instead, the fruit is balanced with a mixture of anise and herb.
Taste--Initially sweet, but not cloying, and boozy, but pleasantly so.  Becomes progressively more complex as it comes to temperature.  Initially fruity, then a subtle and pleasant bitterness, like an unsweetened chocolate develops as it warms.  Unexpectedly carbonated compared with others of this style.  The carbonation helps balance the sweetness and the alcohol.  
Feel--Warming, like a fine cognac or brandy.  I'm trying this for the first time in the Spring.  I cannot help but think that this would be the ultimate brew to enjoy on a cold, snowy night.  Also holds its carbonation remarkably well, especially considering how quickly the head settled.  The carbonation provides just enough "bite" to balance the malty sweetness, and leaves the brew drinkable, even as it comes up to temperature, and the sweetness and other character develops.
Overall--I am a bigger fan of the lighter fare of the Trappist realm--Orval remains a favorite.  But of the Trappist Quads I have tried, this one is a clear cut above the others.  These can be a little cloying on the sweetness, and a little too boozy for my palate.  This one has remarkable balance, and is one of the most complex brews I've tried of any variety.  Would recommend to anyone, and am looking forward to trying again. 1,731 charactersMindcrime1000, Apr 30, 2016

Reviewed in Roger Protz' CAMRA classic "300 Beers To Try Before You Die!" 
It also is reviewed in the "1001 Beers To Drink Before You Die" and should be listed.
MJ's "Great Beers" said "I became something of a devotee of Rochefort 10, specially for its bitter chocolate character.... In 2005, Rochefort 10 was deemed the best Trappist beer by the American magaizine "Mens Journal."
MJ 1999 "Guide" gives it 3.5 of 4 stars saying it "is dark brown, rich, with depths of fruity and chocolatey flavors." 581 charactersBeginner2, Apr 21, 2016

Appearance: Pours a hazy dark brown with just under 1 finger of light tan head. A little carbonation, but hard to see. Lacing was surprisingly poor, but the retention was very, very good - a pretty moderate skim of foam remained the whole way through. 
Smell: Slightly sour/fruity smell; dark fruit, but tart. Cherries/raisins, backed up by a honeyed, malty sweetness. The more I smell this, the more it begins to smell like bourbon or Canadian whisky.  Improves notably as it warms.
Taste: Arrives drier than the smell would suggest; slight tartness, but remarkably clean across mid-palate; no roastiness to speak of, a light maltiness, then turns to the fruit with a complex, downright winey character. That last third of the sip is where all the flavor comes, all at once - it is powerful and profound. Overpoweringly sweet, with complex layers of dried fruits, and a slightly painful sweetness. Alcohol is more noticeable than I prefer. Strangely, it improves as it warms, too. 
Mouthfeel: Somehow, despite this overwhelming sweetness, it is remarkably clean and light. Ample, small-bubble carbonation. Quite clean finish.  Not really bitter, but remarkably clean on the finish. 
Overall: This is clearly a complex Belgian dark ale, but my heart is really not in it. It is too sweet for my taste, and between the sweetness and the alcohol, it is just really more than I can take. I love belgian dark ales, but this is overwhelming in a sense.  I appreciate drinkability, and this must be a sipper. Would be better on a cool fall or winter night than a warm spring evening. 1,609 charactersSaltofOH, Apr 17, 2016
5/5  rDev +11.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I am a long time fan of Ommegang Three Philosophers and Abbey Ale. I've had many other Belgians, both domestic and genuine Belgian, including Delerium ales and ABT 12, and I have not found any that can quite knock the Ommegang 3P or Abbey from my fave list. Well, I've read about this beer, and I was skeptical, and now I have to admit defeat. This is the Belgian to judge all others by. No need to give profiles here, if you like Belgian style beers you know what to expect. Just know that the balance here is perfect on every front. A truly astonishing ale. 559 charactersdatalager, Apr 17, 2016

4.81/5  rDev +7.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Appearance - This beer pours a beautiful deep brown with 2 fingers of soft white head. The head seems to stick around well. 
Aroma -  Dark fruits and im talking Prune, Dates, raisins, they are all there giving it a sweet arome up front. Rich toffee follows this giving a nice bittersweet smell , Roasted nutty malts and than belgian yeast giving off that beautiful fresh bread aroma. This is a beautiful smelling beer forsure!
Taste -  This is probably the first 5 I have ever given for taste but wow it kicks your palate. All the dark fruits hit your tongue first delivering a sweetness almost unheard of in beer. followed by some roasted almost burnt nuts and toffee to balance that, then you get hit with a boozyness followed by some nice fresh bread to wash it down. This is delicious!
Feel  - This is a medium bodied beer with the percentage I almost expected it to be thicker. The carbonation is creamy creating a very smooth drinking experience for 11.3%.
Overall - This beer along with its price point is not a beer to be drank daily. Its going to beat you up a little with flavor and high abv% and after one your probably going to be close to finished for the day. With that said the aroma's and flavor and appearance mesh so well it will be an unforgettable experience. Get your hands on this one! 1,311 charactersCanadianBacon, Apr 15, 2016

Beer pours rich brown in color and nearly opaque, while forming an enormous chestnut head.  Aroma is rich and of dried fruit, raisins.  Flavor matches, bringing tremendous depth and richness of flavor, combined with impeccable balance and ultrafine carbonation.  Toffee, fruitcake, and a very slight tart note which doesn't bring any offense at all.  Not the most complex of the great Belgian quads, but this beer is just really easy on the senses, one might say. 533 charactershreb, Apr 01, 2016

Dark fruits are prominent on the nose with some brown sugar and very light roast and malt sweetness. Actually very subtle. Taste turns the tables and hits with a plethora of flavour. Plum, raisin, fig, cherry, grilled peach, bubble gum, banana, caramel, toffee, tree bark, earth, oatmeal, roasted barley, Graham cracker, pop tarts, baked bread, tobacco, nutmeg, clove and a definitive brown sugar presence. Complex, thick, decent carbonation and slightly chewy. Alcohol presence is hidden very well by all of the flavours going on here and finishes out clean and easy drinking. This one deserves a proper meal pairing. Beyond fantastic and fitting of it's rating. 797 charactersanon, Mar 31, 2016

Smell: Strong fruit ester aromas that feature cherries and plums that features a bready malt and spices. There are also perfume aromas as it warms. 
Taste: The taste features bready and toasty malts with cherries and plums. There is a vinous quality to it and strong alcohol, but it is not hot. It is mostly sweet with a slight bitterness that creeps in towards the finish. 
Feel: It has a moderate feel to it. It finishes very dry with alcohol warming.
Overall: This is a beer that has a complex balance between the malts and fruity esters. The aromas are among the best that I've rated. It is strong in alcohol that is noticeable, but not over done or hot. 754 charactershman43, Mar 27, 2016

The head is huge, fluffy, tan and sticks around for a while. There is no visible lacing. Smell is very complex, sweetness and dark fruits, mostly plum and raisins, with what smells like a slight tartness. Taste is similar, but the sweetness takes center stage and there is no hint of tartness. Feel is medium heavy, but very very smooth. Overall a great beer. 468 charactersCNoj012, Mar 26, 2016

The first time I tried this beer was in Brussels at a random pub, without knowing it's fame and popularity. I'm relatively new in the "beer world" :P But I loved this beer instantly. 
Rich flavour with many layers. Quity fruity but still greatly balanced. Despite the high ABV it's still very smooth. 414 charactersHanga1986, Mar 24, 2016

Extremely foamy head, I was worried this was infected but fortunately it was not. Smells mostly of alcohol. Tastes of raisens and grain alcohol and has a ridiculously dry mouthfeel. 
Overall not bad. I greatly prefer St. Bern 12 though and have yet to try westy. 399 charactersrypkr, Mar 20, 2016

Deep, black, head remains after pouring...
Best drank after at least half an hour outside the fridge.
Aroma is too malty and sugary, not the best.
This is one of the biggest and most courageous beer I have tried, in terms of flavour. It has so many levels, every sip is different. Despite its strength, still it has a smoothness that controls all of its personality. This is amazing beer. Will def try the other numbers also. Though a bit too much of a sugary overtone. And too chocolatey.
Tastes of mocha, cocoa beans, coriander.
Look, aroma, feel...really they are similar to others. The taste is what makes this shine. 
I massively respect the people who made this. They do not care about marketing. Just their actual product, in its essence. Respect. I am happy to have discovered this. Thank you to everyone who made this... 978 charactersAnt777uk, Mar 17, 2016

A - Poured a dense, dark brown, with a one finger tan head that moves to a thin lace within a few minutes.  Very active sounding at the pour.  Visible sediment at the bottom. 
S - Bananas, dark fruit (cherry/fig), bread, some cider notes and slight heat. 
T - Interesting.   Caramel, general quadness/bread, cherry, a little bit of burn. 
M - Very active carbonation happening in the mouth. Would say its medium high.  The heft is full, but not overbearing.  Finishes dry. 
O - I don't visit this style often enough, but this is one is a great offering that's worth a try, even if it is a little pricey. 701 charactersApellonious, Mar 17, 2016

Appearance: Dark brown with huge amount of head (4 fingers).  Sediment is noted on bottle of glass when you nearly finish drinking it.
Smell: Subtle fruity smell.
Taste: Perfectly sweet.  Hints of sugar, caramel  and molasses are noted.  The high alcohol content (11.3%) is masked extremely well. No unpleasant aftertaste.
Mouthfeel: Light carbonation.  Medium body.  Very smooth going down.
Overall.  It isn't hard to see why this is considered a world class beer.  Simply delicious. 534 charactersHappyGuy12345, Mar 13, 2016

Beer was dark brown and lightly carbonated.   Could taste the alcohol in first sip, but it all went down very easy after that.  
Tasted of caramel and lightly reminiscent of nutty chocolate.  
This is definitely "top shelf" beer that I'll truly enjoy once in a while, but it won't go into the regular rotation. 525 charactersKatyBeerGuy, Mar 06, 2016

Smell: Plum, raisin, fig, caramel, alcohol, hint of citrus hop
Taste: Comes right of the bat with lots of dark fruit and brown sugar/caramel. Spicy hops. Heat from the alcohol amplifies the spicy notes. Alcohol taste is there but subdued well by the sweetness. Fairly sweet, but not overwhelming at all. Perfect balance.
Feel: Medium/heavy body, creamy, smooth, just the right amount of carbonation.
Overall an outstanding beer. The more Belgian ales I drink, the more I like them. There's more spiciness here than I've found in other of similar styles. 630 charactersvainosuomi, Mar 06, 2016

Smell is holiday spices, right dark fruits, sweet dessert breads, dates, figs.  Taste is similar to the aromas, rich, dark sugary notes, figs, dates, fruitcake, dark sweet bran cereals, molasses cookies, dark fruit, sorghum, anchored down by a nice pumpernickel bready maltiness.  Feel is super smooth, and dense.  a bit syrupy, but allows all of the flavors to coat the palate.  Great dark Trappist offering for sure.  A winter sipper. 569 charactersSaisonRichBiere, Feb 22, 2016

Poured from bottle a dark, cloudy brown with dark yeast sediment taking a seat on top f the pillowy head, which it rode all the way down... Foamy light khaki head is very lively and has a layer persists to the end. Tons of carbonation, a gentle rock of the glass invokes a fresh layer of bubbles.
Smells very similar to the Rochefort 8, mostly of yeast and kind of soapy; I probably should have let these bottles settle out more before opening because there was a lot of stirred up yeast to contend with. Other smells are very sweet and mixed fruits. Taste is very sweet and full of fruits. Medium to full body and just a hint of booze at the end, a nice amount. Long finish with sweet tastes of cherry, raisins, and candy and maybe tobacco.
Overall, I'm drinking this side by side with the Rochefort 8, and while both are excellent and drink very smooth while hiding their abv, the 10 is just has more going on. Its really delicious and has a few more layers to it than its little brother. 1,032 charactersGreatStoutman, Feb 15, 2016
4.37/5  rDev -2.2%look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured into tulip glass.  It pours a dark mahogany and is opaque when the glass is held up to the sun.  It has a thick, creamy, one-finger ecru-colored head and lacing.  The smell is more subdued than I anticipated.  It's earthy, with some faint fruitiness and a touch of spice.  The taste features banana, current, cherry, tobacco, and other dark fruit, with a smoky peat, and some caramel.  It is an amazingly complex and pleasurable flavor.  This ale is medium-bodied, highly-carbonated, and the 11.3% ABV is not that noticeable but really sneaks up on you.  Overall, this it a very well-crafted and delicious Quad.

A: Over three fingers of head, to start with; tan. Gotta let this settle... Dark, tamarind/brown in the glass. Honey brown-yellow in the dimple. Rather faint, yet sticky sheeting. Okay lacing.
S: Earthy, with a note of dirt. A fairly strong, sweet tree sap/molasses aroma immediately behind that; with a slight earthy sourness to it. Aroma doesn't stick around for very long, though.
T/MF: Flavor is straight up earth; and fairly bitter, at that. Very dry, considering the aroma. There is a note of tree sap. Slight lime pith. With a bright flare at the end. Seems more of a pairing beer than a stand alone. A shame; I've heard people speak really highly of it. It's not bad, but certainly not worth $7 for a little bottle.
Poured from an 11.2 oz. bottle, into a Belgian tulip glass. 841 charactersTruePerception, Feb 07, 2016

Pours a dark honey color with tons of floaties; 2 fingers of an off-white colored head. Only small shimmers of light pass through the beer. Great lacing.
Aroma brings dark fruits, light clove, a bit of banana, Belgian yeast, brown sugar, cherries, and a bit of citrus. 
Taste is brighter than expected. Citrusy; crisp carbonation, banana, a tad bit watery, slight clove spice. Alcohol becomes more present as it warms. 
Trappist Rochefort with 2.5 years of age
Aroma brings cherries, apple juice, dark fruits, citrus, yeast, and rum. 
Much more citrus on the flavor than on the 1 year. Definitely a bit of funk, more carbonation. More alcohol is present on the taste than the 1 year; even a bit of bitterness is noted. Less balanced. I believe this beer peaks at 1 year.
Overall, this is a great, classic Belgian style Quad. It is definitely more citrus forward than expected. The crisp carbonation in combination with this brightness creates something incredibly drinkable, despite the high ABV. I see this pairing well with cherries jubilee. It gets a 91/100. 1,110 charactersDaverCS, Jan 28, 2016
4.7/5  rDev +5.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75330 mL bottle from the LCBO; "best before" Sept 22 2020 and served lightly chilled. Not the first time I've had this one.
Pours a muddy, burgundy-brown colour with reddish highlights, crowned with one finger of foamy, creamy-looking light beige-coloured head. Good retention; it persists at the surface for more than 10 minutes, receding unevenly into a lumpy cap and frothy collar, and simultaneously producing plenty of attractive lace. The aroma is similar to that of Rochefort 8, but with more of a focus on dark fruit. Big notes of plum, raisin, cherry and currant leap out on the nose, in addition to some pronounced caramelized/candi sugar sweetness. Hints of orangepeel and flowers also come to mind, with yeasty notes of banana and clove becoming more noticeable as the glass warms.
While all quality quads will provide a certain level of intensity, this one just does not relent - from the start of the sip until well after you've gulped it down. Saccharine flavours of candi syrup and molasses serve as the background, with those dark fruit notes I picked up on the nose dominating initially. Flavours of cherry, sugarplum, currant and date are each detectable, with a fairly significant hint of banana in there, too. The flavour becomes more herbal and earthy on the back end, with touches of licorice, clove and yeast rounding the profile out. Sweet-ish aftertaste with some alcohol warming, but the booze integrates beautifully. Full-bodied, with moderate carbonation levels that start off fairly assertive, but drop off over time, developing a much softer, smooth mouthfeel once it has had time to breathe. 
Final Grade: 4.7, a superlative A+. Rochefort 10 is one instance where all of the hype is completely well-founded - as far as strong, Belgian-style dark ales go, this one floats amongst the cream of the crop. It is a decadently tasty quad that should be considered an absolute must-try for all serious beer geeks - one bottle will not be enough. While Rochefort 8 has been available year-round in this province for a few years now, I'm still keeping my fingers crossed that this beauty will some day be equally easy to find at the LCBO. 2,162 charactersthehyperduck, Jan 28, 2016

4.5/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Ah, Rochefort 10. Alongside St. Bernardus Abt. 12, it is generally considered the best Belgian Quad that you don't have to spare an arm and a leg for (since Westy 12 is near impossible to find).
Pours a thick dark brown with a hint of red. Chunky tan head. It smells of dark fruits, as any proper Quad should. I also get a hint of soapiness that makes me wonder if this bottle was properly cared for.  2018 best by date leads me to believe this sat for a while. The taste is very smooth for 11% ABV. Becomes a bit stronger as it warms. Figs, toffee, fruitcake, as "easy-drinking" as 11% can be, but still certainly a sipper. Starts with the lively carbonation you expect from a Belgian beer. Aftertaste is clean.
Is Rochefort 10 a word-class beer? No doubt about it. But I think I've had better Belgian brews. If you except that a Belgian Strong Dark Ale is basically the same as a Quad, I've preferred Gulden Draak, Trois Pistoles (Canadian, I know, but Belgian-style), and maybe even Chimay Blue to Rochefort 10. I also seem to be in the minority that thinks 8 is Rochefort's strongest offering. The sweet spot so to speak. While Rochefort 10 is certainly bigger and more complex than something like Trois Pistoles, it is also a bit more earthy and medicinal. 
I would love to try this as intended. Properly cellared in a Belgian basement rather than left on a shelf for who knows how long. A more "ideal" bottle would probably earn a 5. 1,442 charactersmkh012, Jan 26, 2016

The aroma difference with St Bernardus is pretty surprising. Much more of a contrast than I would have guessed before I tried it myself. 
Massive, rocky tan head on this one, tiny bubbles that lace somewhat but not in an appreciable way. Earthy aroma, herbal and almost floral at times. I get some licorice in the flavor and some cherry notes in the bouquet. I don't know if the differences I detect in this beer as compared to Abt 12 are the result of yeast esters or hops, but I'm guessing this is a yeast byproduct. Amazingly complex beer that is actually a little lighter on the palate than Abt 12. But don't be confused about where this sits. It's a big substantial 11.2% Belgian quad and should be handled as such. World class beer. 842 charactersdd43, Jan 18, 2016

The boldest of the three Rochefort beers, 10 is by far my favorite of all of the Quads I have tried. With such a strong, robust flavor profile that is loaded with dark fruits and molasses, this beer is delicious. It balances booziness with complexity in a way that I haven't found in any other Belgian Quads. Delicious beer! 483 charactersBiggtriksta, Jan 12, 2016

Taste is more of the same with hints of caramel, dark fruit, a bit of tobacco smokiness, malty and yeasty, and a little astringency in the finish. The 11.3% ABV is barely noticeable. You could get in trouble with this one! Certainly not a session beer, but very drinkable. 
Mouthfeel is smooth with a mildly prickly and fine carbonation. A little thick, but unlike many beers of this nature it isn't cloying, overly spiced, and doesn't leave your mouth feeling slick or coated. 
overall a great quad. 825 charactersWoodButcher, Jan 05, 2016

Dark copper color; initial big head; 1/4" tan-white layer remaining long after the pour. Nose of candied fruits, anise, and a little sherry. Full, bold taste - smoky cherries, prunes, anise, medicinals, booze - almost like Becherovka in ale form. A little pleasant bitterness left behind. Despite the big head, not as much carbonation mouth feel as expected -- maybe just hiding behind all that big taste. This ale made me yearn for a couple of feet of snow outside and a big roaring fireplace. Would not be my choice for everyday drinking, but rather reserved for a time of quiet contemplation on something really unique and rich. 671 characters11-52_4hops, Jan 01, 2016

a: Rich brown with hints of ruby up to the light. 2 finger billowing, beige merange like head piles on top of itself as if spooned.
s: Deep, rich malts with a bit of caramel sweetness with cooked dark stone fruit, herbs, and light hint of alcohol.  
t: Rich, roasted malts, like a proper pumpernikel, carameled plums and raisins, spices from the yeast and alcohol mingle together for a dry, spicy finish. Hints of anise throughout.

Nose if bready, with dark fruits - red grape and cherry most prominently.  Sweet, almost-bourbony elements on the nose as well.  The palate opens with date and raisins.  Undertones of bread and yeast, with an almost dry-red-wine-like element.  A boozy warmth pervades this beer, though its body is on the lighter side of medium (somewhat thinner than expected).  Overall, a phenomenal beer distinct from the other trappists, that is undeniably world-class.  Arguably even better than (though very distinct from) Westy XII. 628 charactersLAp, Dec 24, 2015

S - Smell was milder than expected but full of malt, yeast, and sweetness.  
T - The maltiness is huge with a salty, toffee, caramel flavor.  The alcohol is there but it somehow does not feel boozy.  Everything rides on a layer of carbonation which balances it all out.  
M - Full body, tingly carbonation - the beer has this great smooth feel I really enjoy. 
O - This is balanced and easy to drink.  Definitely world class in my book. 512 charactersSMZBrew, Dec 23, 2015

Pours a nearly opaque brick brown with a three finger head of dense, fluffy, light brown foam that leaves hilly landscape lace as it recedes. Lots of sediment.
Smells of spiced, dried dark fruit, melted chocolate and faint citrus. Distant roar of alcohol.
Tastes of raisins soaked in rum and rolled in brown sugar, preserved citrus fruit, faint banana chip. Faint earthy hops.
Feels rich, smooth and creamy, full bodied with gentle carbonation. Finishes not quite sweet.
Verdict: Vigorously recommended. Without question the best beer I have ever had. 588 charactersHat_Fulla_Beer, Dec 22, 2015

That said, I can't say it is my favorite quad.  Pours a deep brown with surprisingly little head and only bits of lacing (edit--susequent bottles did not have this issue and had a full head).  Nose is sweet, burnt toffee, and soy sauce.  Flavor is actually a bit medicinal, with big treacle and warm fruitcake.  No doubt it is a very good beer, but I just can't rate it as high as some others do and would reach for the 8 over the 10 most of the time. 548 characterscaptaincoffee, Dec 10, 2015

4.69/5  rDev +4.9%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75First off the bat this is a fantastic looking beer. My Galaxy 6 photo doesn't do it justice by any means. Held to the light i'm getting a spectrum of amber into light brown, with a flickering of sediment that is beginning to settle. Kicks up a pillowy, cloudy head which sticks around and leaves a smattering of lacing as I sip away. I'm getting dates and molasses off the nose with dark rye bread and melba toast. A great many layers to this one, many more as it warms, with plum and apricot coming together in a sweet symphony like a Belgian ale Hall & Oates. Despite the high abv the alcohol burn is not overwhelming - more of a satisfied glow and aftertaste. Satisfying is a good word for this one - it could be the original winter warmer. I'm reminded of the first time I heard 'Pet Sounds' by The Beach Boys in its entirety at 18 years old and feeling glad that I could enjoy a classic for the first time. 911 charactersBarnoloid, Dec 06, 2015

Creamy and frothy orangy 5 finger island sparkling head sprinkled with some dark charred powder, lasting more than 30 minutes, with an average amount of legs. Flavors of dark fruits, cherries, ester fruits, banana yeast, oak, molasses, herbal spices. Highly sugary yet strong bitterness with an earthy feel. Medium body with strong prickly carbonation. Powerful puckering, leathery, and chalky finish, ending with a dry yeasty, dark fruity, and barrel aged feel. Overall the craft is well done but hard to enjoy. Good appetizer and hard alcohol style brevage. Very boozy, super dry, no freshness. I find it difficult to drink having no pleasing elements. It's quite complex while overly intense. 790 charactersTheBierdimpfe, Dec 02, 2015
4.64/5  rDev +3.8%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5This beer is just about perfect.  It pours with a glorious, frothy head as the carbonation is released along with the sweet smells of its fruits, prunes dominant, with the alcohol a constant teasing reminder of the potency within.  It's color is a lovely dark, soft brown with bubbles cascading subtle within.
The taste is extraordinary.  Your tongue will be lavished with sweet fruits (strawberry dominant), lively spice, and hints of the yeasts cloaked within an extraordinary effervescence that combines for an amazing drinking experience.  The sharp smell would lead you to believe that the alcohol would have a stronger influence on the flavor.  Not so.  This beer is excellent.  It looks down on other beers with quirked eyebrow and slow shake of the head.  It makes you want to drink it slowly and savor it - even if you don't understand what it's truly trying to tell you.
One of the best I've ever had. 913 charactersgautch726, Dec 01, 2015

I've had this one before, but simply forgot to review it due to the excitement.  Poured into a goblet from a 11.2oz bottle.  Not much head is present, but you can see the sediment in this beer.  I'm getting a sour plum, grape note?  That being said, I'm getting so much more on the nose.  Hints of chocolate, nuts, and many fruits.  Tastes a bit how it smells, but SO much happening in this brew!  Simply impossible to list them all, look to the other comments for that.   You can get a small tingling of the alcohol (11.3 percent) in the back of your throat.  It really warms you up.  This beer is simply phenomenal.  If you haven't tried this one, owe it to yourself for the experience. 752 charactersBeerLover50, Dec 01, 2015
4.78/5  rDev +6.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Belgian ales, notably Trappist ales, are my absolute favorite beers.  So much depth and complexity to them, so many layers of flavor.  That is what you get with Rochefort 10.
L:  poured into its own Rochefort Trappist goblet, the appearance is like murky dark brown chocolate milk, with sediment being these beers are bottle conditioned (which I greatly prefer) with a huge head, about 2-3 fingers.  HIGHLY carbonated.
S: So many layers.  You sense the alcohol, followed by your strong beer smell of hops and yeasts, followed by layer after layer of dark fruits, prunes, raisins, bready notes.  Very complex.
T: Immediately the high carbonation numbs your tongue, and you sense the alcohol slightly, but it is cleverly masked by the beer characteristics of the dark fruit flavors, yeast/bready taste, slight sweetness.  Perhaps the greatest beer I have ever tasted.  Perfectly balanced yet very complex in flavor.
F:  High carbonation assaults your tongue but opens up your palette.  Each sip of this beer, served slightly colder than room temperature, changes.  You get different flavors in every taste, which is why I highly recommend to enjoy this beer over a long period of time, small sips to truly enjoy the complexity.  This is what a belgian ale/trappist ale should be.  Perfect.
O:  As I said, it is the perfect belgian quad, very heavy on the dark fruit notes and belgian yeasts, which masks the high ABV.  I may never get to try Westvleteren 12, so this will always be to me the greatest beer in the world as its easily available within a few miles of my house.  All beer connoisseurs should have this beer, I have it on special occasions, special dinners, Christmas morning and any time I am in a really good mood and want to celebrate something truly special with a beer that is just that, a truly special ale. 1,828 characterstheamericanpsycho79, Nov 30, 2015

Pours deep tan with a huge tan head that dissipated in about three minutes.  The smell is beautiful plums, figs, and raisins with a strong caramel backbone.  The taste is all sweet candies and caramel on the front.  The dark fruits come through wonderfully on the backend along with a hint of alcohol.  A very thick, highly carbonated, smooth mouthfeel.  Just a phenomenal beer I should really age at some point. 473 charactersjvgoor3786, Nov 23, 2015

About as strong as your average Belgian Quad, but the complex flavors do an excellent job of covering up the alcohol. Poured from a bottle into a glass on 11/13. 265 characterskabirmarwah, Nov 22, 2015

Appearance: dark brown with orange hues and a big creamy head.
Smell: the first thing I noticed was this big and fantastic strawberry smell followed by some plum and cocoa aroma underlying. Really complex. I kept smelling the empty bottle and the cap, which had some creamy yeast that, when touched, released the amazing strawberry aroma. I licked the yeast and it was great too.
Taste: strawberries, plum, chocolate, big creamy maltiness. Despite all of this, it's didn't feel sweet, the alcohol hits the chest and you're in heaven.
Mouthfeel: really creamy and smooth. Fruity and malty. Again, it may smell sweet, but in the end it doesn't feel like that at all. It's wonderful. Like someone said, it's a desert beer, late night drink. Highly drinkable, although I guess with 3 of this you might end up KO.
Overall: fantastic exhuberant beer. I really love that strawberry and chocolate smell with the big malty feel and taste. I'll be getting more of these, no doubt about it. 1,020 charactersjamesroses, Nov 14, 2015

4.42/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 330ml bottle into a tulip:
Appearance: dark, dark brown with a twinge of magenta. Incredibly fluffy and puffy beige head that lasts for what seems like forever. Got a fair bit of trub in the bottom of the glass, but that's to be expected I suppose. Tons of carbonation rising from the bottom. Very active beer to watch.
Aroma: layers of dark fruit, and not much malt on the nose....got a little bit of banana at first, which I did not expect, followed by ripened dark plum, some jammy fig. Really complex.
Taste: whoaaaaaa, tons of fruit!! Starts milder and just ripened fig and orange peel, then finishes with toooooooons of plum. Maybe a little bit of cherry on the finish too? Either way, it is delicious.
Feel: medium bodied, with little carbonation in the mouthfeel, but tons of stickiness and lasting flavor.
Overall: really fantastic, authentic and delicious. I know it's everywhere, but it is still worth buying. A treat! 948 charactersTheElectricOne, Nov 10, 2015

Taste is like raisins, sweet with a dark coffee vibe, but still bitter on the back end.  Figs?  Ripe banana?  Fades into a spicy bitterness.  Creamy in the mouth, sweet and biting in the end.  Full disclosure -- This is my first Quad rating.  I can say beyond a doubt this is more complex than beers I'm accustomed to.  Which is a great thing in and of itself.  I fully respect this beer and it'll certainly inspire me to learn more. 538 charactersanteatr23, Nov 02, 2015

5/5  rDev +11.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Look- Pours an almost vinous looking dark brown with a massive foam head that threatens to spill over. The creamy lace retains throughout and looks like whip cream or a foam cappuccino or latte. On the massive head alone, I deeded there and then to rate it a 5. A beauty to look at.
Smell- So much complexity in the aroma. First, I'm hit with a citric atom, like orange peels. Then, I detect all sorts of other dark fruits; alcohol soaked plums, figs and raisins. Later on, as the drink warms, a toasted biscuity malt like presence is felt. Throughout all these aromas, a strong but not overly boozy alcohol smell is felt on the backend. Intoxicating.
Taste- A predominantly sweet taste that is well balanced by peppery spices and alcohol. Dark bread and light hops. As with the aroma, I pick up dark fruits. A really pleasant creamy chocolate and vanilla like essence in the finish. As the drink warms, the alcohol becomes dominant and truly warms the body. There is also some wood like, barrel aged tones. 
Feel- For the most part, a full bodied brew. However, the feel is so smooth and creamy, that it is dangerously drinkable. The carbonation is soft but prickly. I probably should have sipped it slowly, but it was so delicious that I drank it pretty fast and am feeling quite happy now.
One of the best brews of all time. Certainly the best quad I have had to date. I thought long and hard about this rating, and I simply do not see any flaw in this beer. The experience was so enjoyable, I believe it deserves a 5. 1,521 charactersGajo74, Oct 30, 2015

Amazing beer. As good as any wine. in my top 10. 
Maybe one of the best beers ever made. up there with St. Bernardus Abt. 12.
A: The murky brown liquid pours with a turbulent smokey, rusty pour. A gravity defying, airy, tan head shows peppering of yeast, spice and sediment. The beer takes a very long time to settle with a half-inch head and lace specked with sediment. 
S: Syrupy candy sweetness with fruitiness, spiciness, smokiness,and with a chocolate, tarry, treacle, brandy complexity.
T: Follows smell. Malty richness of dark sugars, caramels, and toffee melded with charred, toasty, chocolatey flavors. Fruitiness of a fall orchard of berries, grapes, dates, figs, plumbs, and apples - all slightly overripe and raisening. Next barrel aged woods  with tang and autumnal, churchy mustiness. 
F: Bold, full feel. The powder-sugar textures develop into a well-rounded beverage. Full, succulent textures balance the acidic fall fruit notes.  Finishes with a dry, airy finish. 
"A magical beer that defies modern brewing logic." as one reviewer wrote. A top 10! 1,130 charactersAct25, Oct 24, 2015

A. Very dark brown with a brownish dirty white foam of 2.5 fingers. Interesting and nice.
S. The flavor changed completely as the beer settled. At the beginning, I could smell notes of something orange-peel-like. There was also some yeast, and a little of bread. I could also perceive alcoholic notes, although they were definitely getting along with the rest of the aromas. Finally, I felt some notes that reminded me of wine. After it settled, I smelled stronger notes of alcohol, and a lot of brown sugar. All the time, the different smells were complementing each other, creating a very nice feeling.
T: Again, I have to speak about the taste before and after the beer settled. At the beginning, I could find bread, some sweetness, and something like wine. There was no bitterness whatsoever. Small notes of alcohol that contributed to the whole experience very nicely. And very, very creamy. Afterwards, the taste turned to be more sweet and dry (you could feel the alcohol better). It included raisins, brown sugar, a little of wood, and no bitterness at all. 
F: Creamy. Very, very creamy. Nice to drink, very full of flavors, and each of the notes is very clear, assertive, and combines perfectly with the rest of them. The beer also turns drier and sweeter as time goes by. It's also a beer that warms you up very nicely. Medium to low carbonation
O: Very impressive. The complexity of this beer, the combination of all the flavors. Everything is very nice. If I want to get a quadrupel, I know what to look for. 1,570 characterssejorules, Oct 24, 2015

3.95/5  rDev -11.6%look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4Consumed on October 15th, 2015. Bottle labeled best before end 02-06-2020.  Poured into Triple Petrus snifter.
Beer pours a murky dark brown. Almost no highlights when held to light. Very thin tan head is all that's left of the initial two fingers of foam after a few minutes.  Minimal sheeting and lacing.
Aroma is sweet bread and booze. Think rum raisin bread with cinnamon.
Flavor is very sweet and hot. Wood character combines with brown sugar notes and some subtle golden raisin. Woody, boozy lingering finish.  Despite being somewhat sweet, the beer is well attenuated.
Mouthfeel is slightly thick and well carbonated. Thinner and easier to drink than one would expect, though alcohol presence is strong.
Not sure how old this bottle is, but it seems to be young. Too young to fully enjoy. Should have cellared this one for a year or two or three... 860 characterscharlzm, Oct 17, 2015

S - Bready, raisons, plumbs, Belgian candy sugar, figs, prunes.
T - Sweet roasted toffee malt base throughout with nice complexity: dark fruit, prunes, plumbs, raisons, and brown sugar.  Up front the alcohol is strong and detracts from the flavors.
M - Velvety rich, very thick, chewy, and creamy.
O - This really is an amazing beer but the alcohol detracts from the beautiful complexity of this beer. 551 charactersjzeilinger, Oct 14, 2015

Pours brown/amber with a massive off white head.  Scents of raisin, dates, pear, plum, spice and it tastes pretty much the same with hits of bread, cherry, malt - some serious complexity.  
While it's not Westvleteren XII, it's pretty damn good.  I'll be interested to compare notes in a few more years. 399 characterswdberkley, Oct 13, 2015

4.41/5  rDev -1.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Pulled a bottle from my beer cellar and decided to finally give this one a try. Best before date of 4.12.2018. 
Poured into an open mouth chalice glass with this walls.  The beer pours a massive tan head that takes a while to settle down. It thins to a quarter inch of foam atop the beer.  The beer looks brown with amber highlights. I had successfully decanted the beer into the glass, but then a second try dumped some yeast & sediment into my glass.  Oh well.
Smells of candied raisins with some light clove. Has a brown sugar note and what seems like spices (cinnamon, allspice, clove).  Hop aroma seems nonexistent if not for an earthy aroma.  Has some noticeable alcohol aromas but nothing harsh. 
Tastes sweet with an upfront bitterness. Caramel, brown sugar, likely Special B malt, with a somewhat chewy texture.  Feel seems medium to full.   Aftertaste has a lingering bitterness pairs beautifully with the lingering sweetness of the malty character.  Seems like I'm drinking dessert.  
Lots of hype on this beer. Bought 2 bottles quite awhile ago. Never opened in pure anticipation.  The longer I waited, the longer the curiosity built for such a highly regarded beer.  I think I'll save the 2nd bottle after it ages another year or two.  This one tasted good relatively fresh.  It hides the alcohol very well if only for some slight warmth in the nose and a little burn in the back of the throat.  Way too drinkable for 11.3% ABV. Glad to have finally caved and cracked open a bottle. 1,499 charactersjwhancher, Oct 03, 2015

strongest trappist beers are not my first option to drink but they are incredible, this one I think the aroma is dominated by the alcohol, nice off white head with not much retention, sweet malt and caramel but mainly the alcohol at the end. 252 charactersjcbogantes, Sep 26, 2015

Can't really imagine a beer looking better than this.  Aroma is of oak, dates, raisins, candied nuts, red grapes, booze and a hint of caramel.  Lots of caramel nutty goodness up front, pralines, and chewy dark fruit with a bitter boozy finish.  Creamy but not super thck feel, bubbly but you don't get much of a tingle.  Excellent stuff, this bottle is much drier than others I've had in the past. 540 charactersBowWowWowYippyYoIPA, Sep 25, 2015

Pours out an opaque dark brown with date coloured hues coming through where the light penetrates on the side. Fervently carbonated, a big 3+ finger head jumped up before settling down fairly quickly to a covering of light coffee coloured head. Carbonation continues to stream toward the surface - looks very alive.
You can tell from the aroma how well ripened this one is. The dark pit fruits come through less sweet and more musty, almost tart/sour on the nose. Also picking up tomatoes and baking spices. The booze is also detectable.
Damn. This is good. Starts with a beautiful prune and date spiced cake flavour that builds quickly into a more fermented raisin that is slightly tangy. The tangyness lingers as the fruits fade to the back and the spice and warming booze become more prominent. Underneath is a strong sweet malt character, like the base for a christmas fruit cake or a sweet dark rye. Med-full bodied and the effervescent carbonation helps this beer stay light and nimble on the tongue. Great mouthfeel.
Overall this is clearly a great beer, as good as Ive heard about. Not much more to be said that hasnt been already, really. I was a bit surprised at the slightly tangy, slightly over fermented old fruit notes, that were present in the taste. One thing, I felt that something had toned down the powerful fruit flavours just a bit. It may have been slightly oxidized, though Im no pro at detecting it. Regardless, certainly as good as billed and a treat. 1,678 charactersEricVonStein, Sep 09, 2015

The first time was amazing, I ordered it online and it tasted super good (this was the first thing I had ever ate or drank that did the whole "oh a different taste" on every sip) that being said the next time I had it I got it from a place in Eugene Oregon called The Bier Stein and it was foul, it tasted like rubbing alcohol even on the second bottle I tryed that night which I let warm up a bit as the place sold it very cold.  The following time was in Public House in the Venetian in Las Vegas, it was like the first time.....life changing.  I tryed the Bier Stein again (stupidly expecting a different result) and it tasted like cold rubbing alcohol again.  The fifth and current time I am trying it the beer I got it from a place in Portland Oregon called Belmont Station and it tasted kinda like malt mixed into rubbing alcohol.  So drinker beware I have found this beer both life changing and undrinkable 963 charactersgrey_wolfe, Sep 08, 2015

5/5  rDev +11.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This is undoubtedly the finest beer I have ever enjoyed. Poured from 11.2-ounce bottle into a tulip glass. Deep, rich brown, voluminous white foam cap. Sweet malts, dark caramel, molasses, figs, so incredibly complex and not overly alcoholic. A world-class quad, deserving of its reputation. 291 charactersdcotom, Aug 26, 2015

4.46/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.511.2 oz. bottle served in a Duvel glass. Pours a medium brown and settles a very dark brown in the glass. Lots of yeast sediment at the bottom of the bottle. Huge 3+ finger head of sticky, off-white foam. Amazing retention. This thing won't budge! Sweet, dark fruit on the nose with hints of leather, oak, baking spices, and vanilla. Heavy weight, and very creamy and smooth. Gigantic notes of dark fruit, figs, leather, and smokey malt up front on the taste. Very delicious. Consistent through the back end, then turns a little sweeter. A good amount of peppery spice on the finish. Sweet dark fruit and leather on the aftertaste, and leaves the palate a bit dry.
Overall, incredibly good. Similar to the 8 in many aspects, though I did feel like this was was on the sweeter side, likely due to the increased abv. No traces of booziness at all, though. This was the easiest drinking 11% beer I've ever had. I'd love to come home to a bottle of this every day for the rest of my life. 985 charactersdo_ob, Aug 26, 2015

Notes taken from 02/28/2015
A:  The pour is a dark and rich mahogany brown with some tawny tones to it and a creamy tan meringue topping.  Nice compact bubble structure form the bottle conditioning that holds tightly for a few lengthy minutes before slipping back down in the glass.   The lace is quite whimsical as it sends thin sheets all across my glass.  Some noticeable yeast sediment. 
S:  I get a bit of musty yeast in the nose with some loamy mineral likeness.  There is a soft touch of light spices there as well with some toned back bready malt action.  Light caramel and brown sugar spice and a dash of dried fig or currants perhaps.  Really mild to me actually and not even all that boozy or sweet.  
T:  Flavors I find somewhat toned down as well with a spiced raisin bread or dried cherry prevalence.  Has a base of roasty brown malts giving off a sort of aged chocolate note.  Blossoms a bit more as it warms but still the esters aren’t really a major contributor here.  There is a mild toffee like sweetness to it along with a few spicy yeast traits and a whisper of smoky phenols.  More than anything I find the alcohol is just incredibly well masked although you know of its true strength.  Has some low bitterness levels across the boards with a mild solvency note to it.  Just not nearly as complex as I was expecting with more of a mineral like quality about it.  Overall experience is a masterful balance to everything however. Makes for some super drinkability given such a burly brew. 
M: Mid to full bodied with a super light and frothy texture on the palate.  The mouthfeel really is perfected here and makes for such a creamy delight.  Touch of dryness in the finish and pretty clean overall with no trace of the alcohol heat.  
D:  While I don’t find this to be quite the character depth as St. Bernardus Abt. 12or Westy 12 the overall structure and mouthfeel are just stellar.  Really drinks way lighter than it should as others have commented.  Nice to finally be ticking one of the world greats. 2,091 charactersNugganooch, Aug 25, 2015

4.85/5  rDev +8.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75This beer pours a rich brown color with massive meringue fluff on top. The aroma leads with overripe banana, bubblegum, brown sugar, and raisin. The flavor is rich, but not too sweet. I get sweat bread, raisin, black currant, chocolate, and caramel. The mouthfeel is full, but not too thick. This really is an outstanding beer, not my favorite style, but this is an excellent example. 384 charactersCzequershuus, Aug 25, 2015

11.2 oz bottle, tulip
A – Very dark brown, mahogany, with a massive, four inch-plus foamy-craggy, light tan head, that lasts forever.  The beer has been sitting for 15 minutes after the pour and there is still a half-inch foam stand on top, with millions of tiny bubbles continuing to effervesce up to the top.  Beautiful beer. 
S – Chocolate and plums, a bit of brown sugar or candi sugar presence.  Some molasses in the next wave.  No hop aroma that I can find.  A bit of spice, quite possibly from the Belgian yeast strain. 
T – Chocolate and light caramel malt, and again the impression of brown sugar.  Plums and raisin flavor high in the mix.   No hop flavor, no real hop bitterness.  
M – Very high carbonation, sudsy and foamy, coating the tongue on every sip.  The body is medium-full, any heaviness offset by the carbonation.  Sweet, but only if you’re looking for it, again balanced by the carbonation.  No real bitterness.  Finishes fairly dry considering the mouthfeel, with little aftertaste, leaving me wanting more.
O – Just an outstanding beer, period, and one with few equals even among the best Belgian strong darks.  Fantastic. 1,181 charactersinfinitebruner, Aug 25, 2015

L - 4.75 S - 4.75 T - 5 M - 5 O - 5
Second tasting on May 6th 2017. Bottled on 07.02.17 (3 months old)
L - 5 - Magnificient consistent head over a clear mahogany body. It's graceful
S - 5 - Bubblegum. Dates, prunes, nuts. Nice ester notes. Lovely complexity. Balanced and restrained
T - 4.75 - follow the smell with some sweetness. Grain notes. Light vinous tartness. Chocolate and cinnamon
M - 5 - Velvety and perfectly carbonated
O - 5 - it's always hard to go against the memory of the best beer you've had. This one doesn't disappoint. This beer is different at each sip. Were the fuck are the 11.3% Abv?! No booze presence at all. The balance of this beer is perfect all along. The satisfaction that goes with it is also perfect. 
Now I have to wait some years to let the one I have in the basement grow old. And get better and better 879 charactersBruno74200, Aug 24, 2015
4.52/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4.75Poured from its 11.2oz bottle into a tulip.
L: Dark and hazy, an almost amber brown. A dense off-white head that lingers and slowly separates into thin little islands, eventually fading away almost entirely. Moderate carbonation.
S: Sweet and dark fruits behind yeast and alcohol. Some caramel and spice. Thick and luxurious.
T: This is a fine wine of beers. A moderate alcohol punch up front accompanied by spice and yeast. Flows quickly into caramel and fruit. Low hop bitterness.
M: Medium body. Easy drinking despite the alcohol, which warms and brings the sensations to life.
O: A wonderful quad that lives up to its reputation. A wonderful treat for after a meal. I'll definitely pick this up again. 710 charactersErlkoenig, Aug 24, 2015
4.7/5  rDev +5.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Appearance: Very dark brown with a lively, lasting head. A small colony of carbonation constantly flowing toward the top. 
Smell: Sweet candy, slightly perfumey, and slightly fruity. Overall aroma reminds of a fruit leather (a fruit strip that looks like leather and is quite delicious) 
Taste: Once you get paste the bubbly carbonation there is a sweetness upfront that fades into a slight alcohol heat that continues to warm and adjust as it travels down to a dry finish. The carbonation reminds of that of a soda. 
Overall: This  is my first 10. After my first few sips I prefer Rochefort 8 as it is a little smoother and more balanced. However, this is a beer that forces thought and rivals any beer out there. For the $7.00 price tag for a 11oz bottle I think it is very worth the money. Not the type of beer to be drunk every day but should be had on more than just special occasions. 893 charactersAlexonMoon, Aug 24, 2015

4.16/5  rDev -6.9%look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25This was poured into a chalice.
The appearance was a dark brown almost black color with a foamy white one and a half fingered head that dissipated pretty quickly. It dissipates ever so slowly and brings in nice foamy clingy lacing.
The smell had some apples, cinnamon, light vanilla, a little bit of cocoa, light amount of coffee, with some Belgian spice.
The taste takes those flavors and combines nice and sweet with an underscore of the spice.
The mouthfeel is about medium bodied. Carbonation feels nice and maintains a decent level but low enough to let the booze hit warmly.
Overall, what a classic, what's not to enjoy. Of course I'd have again and am glad I have some more going into the cooler months of the year. 722 charactersSitkaSteve, Aug 20, 2015

Pours dark reddish brown with some lively carbonation that dissipates quickly.  Looks like a murky strong tea color.  Some chunky yeast settles to the bottom with other particles in suspension.
Nose is fig and raisin and some yeasty notes.  Has a sweet fruity background and maybe a hint of light roasted coffee.
Taste is blend of ripe fruit with plums and some caramel sweetness.  Sweet maltiness and hints of sugar cookie of all things.  It's not overly sweet by any means but the malt flavored all compliment each other.  A bit of light bitterness really keeps this in the zone.  There is a lot going on with this one for sure.  As it warms some, the dark fruit notes really settle in primarily dates and plum.
Feel is moderate body with high carbonation.  Lively on the tongue
I think this is my first try at a quad.  It's really good and complex.  Malty and hints of sweetness with some bitterness and high carbonation to compliment the malts.  will certainly try more quads now but I think this one is up there with the best of the best so maybe I set the standard to high. 1,106 charactershopflyer, Aug 13, 2015

A: Dark red/amber in color with a thin, white head which appears to be a thick, creamy foam. It never dissipates and seems to coat the top of the beer. 
S: Has a strong alcohol smell to it. Banana, grapes, raisins, cloves and and an earthiness component.
T: The alcohol is quite apparent, but besides that it is very close to all the notes originally detected in the aroma.
M: Moderately-high in regards to carbonation, very prickly to the tongue. Medium body. Almost soda like to me.
O: This is a dead on to the Westvleteren 12 minus the amount of carbonation (fizziness) and slightly more detectable alcohol warmth. I love it!! Westy 12 won the taste test by only a hair! You can find my review of Westy 12 in my reviews!! 819 charactersMA_hops, Aug 12, 2015

Still better flavor and more dynamic than the 6, and it's high ABV is nicely disguised, but the heavy sediment adds too much grit to the palate.

4.6/5  rDev +2.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5The two most prominent things I note with this beer:  1)  at the back of the throat, a definite dryness, while at the front and on the lips, a sugary sweetness.   I really dislike port for the sweetness, but this is somehow a better result.         
2) How the alcohol level doesn't completely overpower the taste profile of sweet malts is a marvel.   My own rule-of-thumb with IPAs is all the subtle hop tastes get obliterated at 8+% abv's.   This beer is 11+%, but there's very little telltale astringency. 
Quite nice, but I do prefer the Rochefort 8. 555 charactersbilbobrewer, Jul 26, 2015

4.4/5  rDev -1.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Appearance: Poured into a La Trappe chalice.   The head is thin and creamy but doesn’t dissipate and was remarkably present until the last sip.   Dark brown and cloudy and not quite transparent.
Smell: Smells of fresh raisins (Can raisins be fresh?).   Smell honestly takes the cake here.   I would love to have a candle with this aroma.
Taste: Malt is prominent.   There is a lingering fruity tingle in the back of the throat. 
Feel: This beer had the consistency of gelatin.  Rolling the beer in my mouth felt as though I broke the surface tension and released the real flavor.  
Sipped while working.   Served cold but slowly reached room temperature.   Temperature overall had no effect on taste or consistency. This is definitely a beer to be consumed slowly over time in a laid back setting. 803 charactersOnTapoftheWorld, Jul 24, 2015

The aroma is rich with dried fruit, such as figs, dates, and prunes. A light sourness is balanced by sweet molasses, followed by spice and pumpernickel bread.
Quite sweet without being cloying as a faint bitterness takes hold late in each sip. The finish is similarly bitter with light acidity. Warmth brings out the raisins and other dried fruit in an unfolding journey from sweet nectar to rich, fresh-baked wheat bread.
A full body with a creamy texture of velour. Only a hint of alcohol, well below expectation, while the carbonation is explosive.
This is an exquisite beer to be savored during a long session while contemplating life’s journey and enjoying the company of someone you love. 912 charactersSLeffler27, Jul 19, 2015

4.91/5  rDev +9.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 50,33l/bottle. Bought from Belgium in 9/14 - enjoyed in Tampere, Finland, 1st of July 2015.
Appearance: dark brown and bit hazy, looks very inviting indeed. Decent, one inch lacy head that lasts for couple of minutes. Plenty of carbonation.
Smell: overall sweet, a bit of toffee in the mix, but also some sense of wild berries comes out of it. And finally some roastiness and nuts.
Taste: taste follows accordingly from the smell. To start with, the malt-department is really heavy, but well balanced at the same time, right as you would expect it to be. The first feel is roasted, even smoky caramel malts. After the initial impression, I can sense increasing bitterness, followed almost immediately by the mixture of yeast and some sweet notes that reminds me of the smell - a mixture of caramel/toffee and refreshing (!) berries. The taste lasts several minutes in the sides of my tongue and cheecks. Almost no sense of booziness at all, which is something you could easily expect from above 10.00 ABV "quads". 
Mouthfeel is superb, really full but not too agressive. Nice level of carbonation makes it easy to enjoy even if the body is very "thick", to say the least. The overall feeling gets even better when you drop the last drops of yeast in to the glass and wait for the beer to get a bit warmer.
Overall, fantastic, if not the best beer I have ever tasted. Even better than Westvleteren and all the other quadruple Trappistes. This is one of those things they only know how to brew in Europe. 1,506 charactersTapioju, Jul 01, 2015

Appearance was brown with a nice size head that stuck around for a bit (with the help of a quick pour). I was not careful to leave the settled yeast in the bottle and I didn't care for it being in my drink. 
Aroma was of mild caramel malts, nothing special. hopefully the taste is where it's all at. 
Taste is a bit spicy, and malty. very muddled and lactic flavor profile. tastes like an average Belgian, but nothing great. 
Drinkability was a bit low, since I kept thinking that I would rather be drinking something that tastes good. Maybe i will try it again but from a different source. 672 charactersExtraStout, Jun 29, 2015

4.37/5  rDev -2.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Of course it is an awesome beer, so what can I add to all the praises? 
Well, for one, the mouthfeel is particularly outstanding which I think may be due at least in part to a kind of optical illusion that plays out on the palate, if you will. It occurred to me with this latest delve into a bottle of Rochefort 10 that the ridiculous feeling of smoothness one gets does seem to actually stem in part from the edge of bitterness that never quite arrives and becomes equalized by the chocolate covered grape taste that follows. 
Another is the tiny islands of glutinous foam that form on the surface of one's drink and allow the drinker some dreamy cloud gazing to be done. A unique and very welcome feature of this great beer that I don't recall ever seeing in others.
The jury is still out, in my case, as  to whether this is the best quad of them all, but no doubt it is among them. Not that Rochefort 10 needs anyone's confirmation at this point. 952 charactersShemmy, Jun 22, 2015

Look: Dark Brown with a small head, smallish bubbles which dissipates in about ten to twenty minutes 
Smell: Same vein as Westy 12, - the Alcohol present but not overpowering, but more present than Westy 12. 
Taste: You could do worse than this quad, a lot worse. The flavors are not trumped by the alcohol, but you can sense it, like I said above a bit more than Westy 12 
Feel: Nice mouth feel.
Overall:  One of the best Quads I have had. This came closest to Westy 12 on multiple side by side comparisons. But not as good. 683 charactersShort-Pour, May 29, 2015

For me, this was overly sweet, like drinking black licorice.  Whatever complexity this beer had or has was lost to me from the alcohol and sugars.  Undercarbonated, barely had any head.  I sipped this thing for an hour, so I gave it a fair shot.
Will revisit sometime in the future, but I'm not in any hurry to do so. 386 charactershoppytobehere, May 28, 2015

4.74/5  rDev +6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Poured from a bottle into a chalice, the beer is a very dark, opaque, date coloring with a steady flow of carbonation bubbling throughout the body and a bubbly, low profile, off-white head. Aromas of date, fig, raisin, black cherry, molasses, brown sugar, vanilla, and earthy highlights. This is about as layered and deep as it gets. Flavors are richly sweet and heavy forward, with date, fig, raisin, plum, brown sugar, molasses, roasted toffee, subtle booze notes, peat, and hints of wood and char. This is a beast, but it's so perfectly balanced that you really can't get overpowered by anything. Smooth bodied and robust, but kept drinkable by the enlightening carbonation bubbling. The aftertaste is more of the old world fruits all blending together to balance the building warmth from the increased ABV. Smooth, layered, slow finish, with a linger of rich fruit sweetness and building warmth. What a great beer. 918 charactersGarthDanielson, May 28, 2015

Whatever gives this 11%er such a big fluffy head also gives it that uncanny mouthfeel. Pure magic. 346 charactersgorbos, May 27, 2015

Fruity with notes of raisins and cherry, caramel, toffee, and some light vanilla notes.
The sweetness of caramel and toffee plays a larger role in the flavor, the dark fruits take a backseat at this point, but still apparent and the vanilla expands in flavor.
Medium-heavy bodied, medium-high carbonation, sweet, slightly fruity, smooth as hell.
Overall, this is a perfect example of the style and the best part is this amazing brew is easily accessible. 566 characterslarryarms847, May 25, 2015

Smell:  Not a very strong smell in my opinion.  Smells slightly malty and boozy but thats about all I get.
Taste:  Caramel and dark fruit (plus banana) creates a very nice taste.  Everything is present in perfect balance.  the booze present in the most leaves you with a biting aftertaste, but nothing overpowering.  This is a well balanced quad, although it is sweeter than most.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.
Feel:  Refreshing yet flavorfull.
Overall:  My favorite of the rochefort trio. 595 charactersPourharddrinkslow, May 17, 2015

3.9/5  rDev -12.8%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 3.5Look:  Ridiculous amounts of foam pouring slowly from a 330ml bottle into a Belgian styled glass.  This massive froth is a nice off-white / khaki color.  The beer itself is a deep amber/brown (more on the brown side) and only lets a few rays of light through.  The head slowly recedes and you are left with a major ring around the edges with some continuous lacing.
Smell:  Slight tart and vinegary at first, but then strong caramel notes kick in.  There are minor alcohol notes evident but not that noticeable for an 11.3%’er.
Feel:  Full bodied thick and caramely.  The alcohol instantly bites the tongue and there seems to be a battle between dry and sweetness.
Taste:  The first flavors are of tart purple fruit (plum, grape, etc.), and then the alcohol bite quickly comes in to play.  There is a slight alcohol burn like doing a shot of 100 proof rum.  There are strong caramel flavors, roasted nuts, and smoked grains.  The strong alcohol taste fades briefly, but seems to kick back in at the end.
Overall:  This is a great beer, but I don’t agree that it is a 5/5 or 100 on score… I had hoped for a bit more as I have heard a lot of hype.  There are many flavors that meld together nicely, but I believe that they are slightly devalued by the strong alcohol notes.  It just seems a bit off balanced.  I think this one would be better at a lower ABV (possibly less demerara/raw sugar as most Belgian Quads have as an ingredient).  Not my favorite brew, but I wouldn’t be afraid to give it another try in the future. 1,533 characterssjdevel, May 10, 2015

Smell: Candied sugar dominates the smell. There is also strong prunes and figs.
Taste: This beer is brilliant. Theres no other way to put it.  As soon as it hits your tongue you get a smoky deep tobacco taste that instantaneously transitions into  sweet candied fruits. There is a slight alcohol taste that you forget about after a few sips. 
Feel: Medium mouthfeel. Viscous yet not syrupy like I would have expected.
Overall: My expectations were far surpassed. I had mixed feeling going in on whether or not I was going to truly enjoy this beer. Most Quads I have had in the past have turned me off to the style. In drinking this I have new hope; After my last sip was gone I instantly knew I needed to buy another! 865 charactersbigsteve45, Apr 26, 2015

Trappistes Rochefort 10
Quadrupel – 11.3% - 330ml Bottle - Bottled 15.04.15 – (9 1/2 months old)
Through tasting, tasting and more tasting of Trappistes Rochefort 8, I have come to the idea that only after  an absolute minimum of 8 months in the bottle, has the yeast had just enough time  to calm down and level out enough to lose a certain ‘metalic’ taste that I’m not keen on. (Metalic is, perhaps not the best term here, as it is a flavour produced by the yeast, but that is the best way I can describe it.) After this magical 8 month mark, I have found that the beer evolved into something fantastic, after 10 months it’s almost beyond words – and a permanent feature in my top 10 beers of all time. 
I now know that, upon reflection, it was this same metalic taste that made me instantly dismiss, what must have been, a very fresh bottle of, Rochefort 6 and also, possibly the 10 on a number of occasions afterwards. So, now that I have a number of 9.5 month old Rochefort 10’s in my cellar, I am really looking forward to reviewing one to find out if it’s as good as its little brother at this age.I also happen to be visiting Belgium in the near future and would like to know if its worthy of some precious car-boot space on my return journey!
Appearance: Served in the correct chalice glass at a cellar temperature of 15°. Lots of smoke upon opening and very noisy upon being poured. A black brew with a very deep red tinge which is only apparent when held up to the light. Has a tan coloured, very lively, head that dissipates quickly, leaving just the centre of glass - above etching - covered. Head constantly changes size and density while beer is in the glass.
Aroma: Raisins, alcohol, sherry, bran, molasses, warm milk, malt - horlicks, blackberries, jellied sweets.
Taste: Sherry first, then a huge hit of raisins, then the real treat comes after you swallow with an absolutely humongous finish that evolves, changes and goes on forever. Very sweet at first, then the Horlicks (contains pilsener malt), then really strong black licquorice, molasses and golden syrup, then the dark fruits come and its all rounded off, eventually, by a tiny little bit of alcohol warmth, that nearly goes undetected. The 11.3 % is so well hidden, it just slides down and after half a bottle I can feel it but it feels like I haven't tasted any alcohol yet. There is so much going on in this Belgian quadrupel, taste wise, that it's difficult to get it all down. It is very sweet and is one that is fit for certain occasions but when it is that occasion, nothing else would do.
Mouthfeel:  Oily, creamy and smooth.
Overall: I cannot believe firstly, that I was disappointed by this beer in the past and secondly, how much difference a few months left in the cellar has made to it, it is now truly stunning. It’s like the 8 in so many ways, and yet also so different. You can certainly tell they’re from the same family but it is not just a case of the 10 being a little darker and stronger, there are much bigger differences than that in the way that they drink. I don't think that this a better beer than the 8 just different. This is certainly more complex with the longest finish I think I've ever experienced, and perhaps slightly more interesting because of it, but the 8 is more balanced and, one could argue, more enjoyable for it. Either way, score them both equally at 11 / 10. Needless to say, I will be bringing some back from Belgium with me next week. 3,501 charactersMrDell, Apr 18, 2015

A: Dark brown, with an off white creamy head, lots of tiny bubbles in the head, some carbonation streaming off the bottom, some minor lacing.
A: Dark fruits, raisins, figs, yeasty aromas, it's a big Belgian yeast bomb, slight alcohol on the nose, malts definitely come through, smells really big. 
T: Toffee sweetness, dark fruits, Belgian yeast, malts, nice slight caramel sweetness on the back end, very complex, some heat, but for 11.3% very drinkable, world class flavor.
M: Nice medium mouthfeel with a dry finish.
O: Very impressed, very complex, changes as it warms, very drinkable. I avoided imports especially Belgian beers because I think there are great beers made in America, but, there is something special about Belgian beers, and in my humility, I must admit that this is a world class beer, a must try if you want to taste something outside your comfort zone. 922 charactersBrolo75, Mar 30, 2015

Has an unbelievable and delicious yeasty head with a lot of chocolate tones.
Taste is way maltier, easy to feel the roasted malts, yeast and chocolate tones, some candy and dried fruits too.
Feel is incredible, almost perfectly balanced in the body, carbonation, bitterness (maybe a bit more bitter I would give a 5).
ABV is 11.30% and is extremely well hidden. 465 charactersJaimeLondon, Mar 11, 2015

Appearance: Dark but not completely without light, decent amount of light white bubbles. Nicely done.
Aroma: Dark ripe fruits and some caramel notes but not overly sweet, nice aroma overall
Taste: Extremely clean, more clean than the Abt. 12 but not as clean as the Westy, vinous character and not as much of the estery yeast noticed either. This one might be as good or better than the Abt. 12 and on par with Westy 12. Considering the ease of getting this might be the clear winner.
Overall: Very well made beer, extremely accessible and one I would go to over and over for the style. One of the best made quads on the planet and worthy of the high ratings. Very complex but has enough clean finish to make it worthy of looking out for. Definitely check this on out. It does not drink the abv that it is labeled as. The Belgians really do know what they are doing! 911 charactershumuloner22, Mar 11, 2015

5/5  rDev +11.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I always see this at the top of the ratings but just now have gotten around to trying it.
A - Deep brown color that is almost ruby in the light. Rocky nice tan head. Lots of yeast sediment at the bottom and tried to keep most of it in the bottle and keep the beer clear.
S - Lots of aromas bubbling off of this one. It has plenty of the typical Belgian yeast spice character but with a distinct caramel, molasses, and malt sweetness that I have never truly gotten from a Belgian dark ale before. There is also a complex fruit character like dark cherries and currant. 
T - Very similar to the smell having the Belgian character with lots of malty goodness sitting on a bed of the caramelized sugars. Has a lot of sweetness but the flavorful spice character helps and It's a complex beer that gets even more complex the more your tongue gets used to the Belgian flavors and it warms pulling you more in to the depths of this Belgian strong ale. Again the sweet sugars have this complementary black cherry flavor that is really top notch.
M - Full to moderate mouth-feel. Moderate carbonation making the flavors pop instead of just stick there. I really enjoy the complexity with the great drinkability that isn't too common of Quads.
Overall, a tremendous beer that has such flavor and complexity. I would strongly recommend trying this one since it is usually pretty easy to find and has so much to offer. Give this beer a try and I'm sure that you will taste an adventure that you won't easily forget.

Yeasty esters, bread, and lightly caramelized sugar take the nose.Tastes of bread, almost no alcohol (truly remarkable at over 11+%), and a slight sweetness make this the finest example of the style. This is the best brew in what’s also my favourite style, and thus is the best beer I’ve ever experienced. 363 characterstekstr1der, Feb 15, 2015

4.57/5  rDev +2.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5A: Very dark brown with one finger of toffee colored head that unsurprisingly dissipates quickly.
S: The alcohol is already very prominent on first sniff, sweet dried fruit trying it's hardest to shine in as well.
T: The 11.3%ABV is there, make no mistake, but it is a surprisingly satisfying warmth that is not enough to make this overpowering. Sugar coated dark fruit and molasses hit me quite strongly as well. It then seems to finish slightly bitter and very dry.
F: Very full, creamy body and great carbonation.
O: One to sip slowly, it certainly wants to warm up a little coming out of the fridge. Quite strong, but presents itself beautifully as every sip evolves in the mouth and leaves you wanting more. Not cheap, but worth every penny. 750 charactersZebraCakez, Feb 09, 2015

Poured a dark, hazy brown with a one inch white head.  Tons of lacing that sticks around throughout the drinking experience.
A complex aroma of fruits and spices.
The taste is just as complex as the smell with tons of dark fruit flavors accompanied by toffee and significant booziness.
Medium to Full-bodied and nice and creamy.
Every sip seems to bring new flavors.  This beer keeps you coming back for more while drinking it so I could definitely see drinking several more of these in the future. 553 characters10Crumra, Feb 08, 2015

Nose is abundant with dark fruit, toffee, spices, roasted malt, slight boozziness. 
Taste follows nose. It has a lot more roasted malt than I was expecting. Smooth with only a hint of boozziness. One of the more complex beers I've had.

Similar in profile to the Rochefort 8, dark muddy brown in color. Flavor is similar but definitely can taste the EtOH in this one. Slightly more bitter/dry flavor than the 8 with more complexity. Same dry fruits but with less esters? A great dark belgian ale. 313 charactersLordofthePings, Feb 01, 2015

4.53/5  rDev +1.3%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Appearance: muddy brown, unfiltered, like prune juice; very fine sand coloured head, like frothed egg whites, great lace
Aroma: floral, cinnamon, clove, five spice, banana; amazing and perfumy, like it was designed just for the nose
Taste & Mouthfeel: stings with alcohol which is balancing intense dark, fruits - prune, dates, figs; lightly of banana medicine you had as a kid; medium carbonation and body, really just right for the style; super dry finish and acidity are making it dangerously drinkable - and the intriguing flavour isn't slowing the pace either; mild semi-sweet chocolate, vanilla, toffee malts
Overall: really outstanding example of a good Belgian ale, one of my personal favourite styles, with amazing aroma and flavours that encourage far too rapid consumption; pair this with an equally intricate dessert - I'm imagining a cheesecake with a chocolate cookie crust topped with berries. 911 charactersBGDrock, Jan 30, 2015
4.76/5  rDev +6.5%look: 4.25 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Very dark beer, no sign of light through the glass whatsoever. The liquid is some very very dark brown. Whatever: #1A0000. Beige head, with big bubbles, that leaves constantly on top of the liquid while I am drinking as if it was a cappuccino, after a very lively pour. The aroma is an absolute encyclopedia of fragrances.  Dates, figs, plums, brown sugars, caramel, leather,  pungent and acidic at times. This would be a blast consumed with aged cheese! Shares some characters with a good red wine. The taste is so perfectly balanced! All that was promised in the aroma continues to spring in the taste, and, very surprisingly no alcohol whatsoever.

Lots of floaties going on but a great beer. My gf and her friend also took to it and want to drink it lol But at $8 a bottle, i'll keep this one to myself. Cheers 353 charactersiTunesUpdates, Jan 26, 2015

4.68/5  rDev +4.7%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75I had no idea what to expect when popping this bottle aside from a recommendation from a reliable friend of mine to try trappist beers. Pouring it out, the khaki head was thick, but eventually went down quite a bit (though never completely dissipating). Looking in the glass, it was fast apparent that this is the opposite of a well-filtered beer, with little bits dancing about in the carbonation. Color is very pretty; depending on the angle of the light hitting it, it can display mahogany or rosewood tones. The flavor has a sweetness to it that stays in my mouth, the kind of complex sweetness that a dried fruit like a date or a raisin has. No hops to speak of, but maybe a little bit of alcohol on the back end. The flavor is rich and complex, without being overpowering, and that is part of what makes this beer such a pleasure. That combined with the beautiful appearance and the aroma (with notes of dried date and rich caramel) show the obvious master craftsmanship that went into the making of this brew. 1,016 charactersplaidowl, Jan 21, 2015

3.88/5  rDev -13.2%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Excellent, well-balanced flavours, without the harsh, raisiny/bready "typical Belgian" yeast taste 90% of the Belgian ales seem to have these days.
However, it does seem very light in body and flavour, and I wonder if it was always like this.
For example, I note in the Bros first review some 15 years ago, they note a big sweet malt characteristic whereas to me the beer seemed rather light-bodied.  
I like everything about it but might wish for "more", in other words. 474 charactersHodgson, Jan 03, 2015

However,  since reading the reviews from the BROS and having somewhat of an understanding of what this is supposed to taste like, I THINK it's pretty spot on. Given that I haven't much experience with this type of beer, it very enjoyable. I gave some to my mother to try as well (which is someone who doesn't know the first thing about different beer styles at ALL) :) and she loved it. This is a beer that you have to try in order to give a review. I suppose it will taste different to everyone given the tremendous complexity of it, but just my two cents, it's worth trying a few or more in order to fully appreciate this wonderfully well rounded Beer 725 charactersbman13, Jan 03, 2015

4.51/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Fresh bottle with a BB date of 07/2019 (bottled on 07/05/2014)
Appearance: dark brown with light showing on the edges of the glass. Very high carbonation; beer started leaping out of the bottle when we opened it. There was a nice and light head that sank to nothing in the glass.
Nose: alcohol, prunes, candi sugar, banana
Taste: prunes, raisins, surprisingly light mouth feel for such a strong beer, very spicy and smooth, slight hop bite in the end, warming alcohol finish.
Overall: in my head I had this one pegged as a perfect 5. I've had Rochefort 8 and 6 before and I had to try the 10 when I saw it on the shelf. I was disappointed with the appearance of this one. It is just a dull brown beer that has little to no head while you drink it. This is in part because of the high alcohol content but it would be nice to see more of a head on this one. Not the best beer I've had this year but a classic example of a Trappist Ale. 937 charactersClavisAurea, Dec 28, 2014
4.42/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Best before 7.5.19. Drank 12.26.14. Poured into a 8oz snifter from a 11.2oz bottle.
This beer has been a long time coming for me. I had heard great things but could never get around the $7-9/bottle price tag. Was in the boonies over the holidays and felt that the holidays were the perfect excuse to splurge and give this beer a shot.
A: One finger of clean, bright, tan head. Fine foam with a few medium sized air pockets. Pours a deep ruby brown, similar to plum wine, plenty of active carbonation. Head eventually fades to a silky cap, which lingers for around thirty minutes before disappearing entirely.
S: Ripe banana, clove, stone fruit (specifically cherry and plum), toffee, dark chocolate, super sweet Belgian yeast.
T: Rich, decadent, very similar to a excellent rum cake. Mild spiced rum, stone fruit, delicious malt, fresh split oak... aka hardwood, dark chocolate, crisp barley, and once again... super sweet Belgian yeast.
M: Finely carbonated, medium body, medium viscosity. After taste is similar to port wine, albeit with welcoming carbonation and a creamy malt linger.
O: An absolute treat... and at its price point, it should be a rare treat for most. Layered, nuanced, complex, deep, rich... and quite possibly a little beyond my comprehension. I  would recommend this to anyone.
Note: Everything about this beer improves the closer it gets to room temperature. 1,389 charactersuntitledeuphoria, Dec 28, 2014

Aged 2 years 
A - Brown and murky. The head is full but dissipates quickly.
S - A nice combination of dried fruits and alcohol. Raisins, figs, and perhaps dates. 
T - The flavors are subtle and don't leave much on the palate. As it warms, those dried fruits come through a little more along with the alcohol presence. 
M - Nice carbonation, medium body. 
O - While a very good beer, I expected more. I anticipated the two years of age to bring out more flavors and contribute to its complexity. The flavors were just too subdued and left my palate too quickly. Perhaps two years is not the ideal aging time. 630 charactersBigOldOaf, Dec 25, 2014

It's the pinnacle of the Trappist beers I've tried.  My only small gripe: The taste of alcohol was a bit much for me.  It overpowered the beer, IMO.  It's possible I was using an unsuitable glass that concentrated the alcohol vapor. (Spiegelau Witbier glass) I would definitely like to revisit this. 372 charactersmickmanhattan, Dec 24, 2014

The aroma is of sweet fruit, spice, and with slight sourness and funk.
The taste is roasty and sweet: dried fruit -- maybe figs. There is a very low hops presence.
The medium level of carbonation is nice. The beer has an appropriate body.
Overall, I like this a lot -- quite a bit more than Rochefort 8. 391 charactersbreakingbland, Dec 24, 2014

O: It's a tasty quad (and still one of my favorite Belgians overall).  Readily available and consistently delicious.

Would love to see how this ages but can tell the brewers put enough care into this to wait until this was ready for our tasting. 670 characterswaitwhatamidrinking, Dec 22, 2014
4.36/5  rDev -2.5%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Appearance: Plenty of carbonation in the dark brown body, which is odd since there was barely a line of head. There a couple spots of brown yeast floating in the beer, despite leaving a inch in the bottle.
Smell: Warming helps out the beer quite a bit, rich toffee malt with chocolate notes. There's also a background note of plum and cherry. Could be a little bit strong, but I like what I am smelling.
Taste: It's like drinking a mix of rum cake and black forest cake, it's so rich. Starts with a mild spiced rum taste with toffee malt in the background and then, rich chocolate, cherries and stone fruit as the chocolate ends with a slight dark chocolate twang with another mild caramel malt hit.
Mouthfeel: The carbonation helps out the entire beer, although points do get deducted for the lack of head. The aftertaste is a very nice mixed bag of the main taste that knows just how long to linger. Good transitioning as well, although I've had better, but that's like complaining about getting a wrinkled hundred dollar bill.
Drinkability: On the heavier end of medium bodied, which is actually mild for something this rich, and a Quad with that much malt. It's really smooth and easy to drink as it settles down well, which is surprising how much carbonation is present.
Final Thoughts: While it didn't quite impress as much as their #8 did, this is another solid offering. I sincerely hope #6 makes it to the LCBO at some point, because this was excellent. I wonder if these monks considering trying their hand at a Tripel. Thumbs up. 1,545 charactersTheHammer, Dec 22, 2014

a: unbelievably murky.  chestnut hue.  finger of tan head
s: a ridiculous rich and sweet melange of caramel, bread, and candied dark fruits (i'm getting massive raisin and date aromas, with hints of figs and plums).  some earthy notes, and a pinch of alcohol.  the dark fruits emerge vastly as it warms.  what i like about this is that the earthy notes aren't so forward, like in rochefort 8.  a true KO aroma
t: much like the nose.  rich and malty sweet up front, exhibiting notes of caramel, freshly-baked bread, and brown sugar.  mid-palate is where all the aforementioned dark fruit flavours kick in, along with some sort of cooked apple note.  minimal alcohol presence. undeniably decadent and sugary sweet, with dominating malt characteristics, but a medium-level bitterness kicks in quickly enough to keep everything on a leash.  ends off with lots of lingering flavours, slighty earthy touches, and even some sort of dark chocolate/cocoa note
m: medium-bodied with moderate, somewhat lively carbonation.  quite dry on the finish
o: sweet, rich, complex, and delicious 1,182 characterskevinlater, Dec 10, 2014

Color is dark mahogany and completely opaque.  A creamy two-finger foam lingers forever.  Lots of semi-sticky lacing.  Smell is really complex - lots going on here.  There are dark fruits, some banana notes, malty sweetness all blended with some phenols.  Flavor is equally complex with malt, lots of fruit and some booze.  Body is light/medium, really creamy, lots of carbonation.  It's very drinkable for an 11.3 ABV.
Overall, a great example of what a quad can be when everything comes together. 567 charactersmr-jj, Dec 07, 2014

Appears to be a good deal of sediment that has gathered at the bottom. A good deal of thick, milky lacing is left on the glass. The top layer retains a thin, spotty head, creating some interesting off colors to look at. 
Very complex aroma. Definitely some lightly roasted chocolate, dark fruits, sweet caramel malts and toffee. The sweetness is strong, almost overwhelming to the nose. A bit of banana (a little bit more of a banana bread type aroma than straight banana. A hint of figs as well. The sweet caramel malts really stick to the tongue, almost giving it an authentic candy caramel effect. 
My gosh. The taste! Leads with some very sweet caramel sugars and some dark fruit, most noticeably cherry. Followed up by some very lightly roasted chocolate and just the slightest hint of nuts. Very complex flavor. Has a very creamy nature to it, giving it a coffee creamer type taste (french vanilla).
Super smooth, milky and creamy. Very easy to down for 11%. A little bit more carbonation than I expected. 
This was my first quad, and I was a bit worried that due to my inexperience, I wouldn't be able to appreciate it. How wrong I was. This is the best beer I've ever had. No weak points here, and has some superior drinkability for any beer, made even crazier by its ABV. Truly sensational. 1,389 charactersmajorbase2, Dec 07, 2014

Appearance: Pours very dark with a good light off white head, which lingers.
Smell: Caramel, plums, raisins, candy sugar. Very sweet smelling.
Taste: Bliss. All the notes of the smell, in perfect harmony. Holy wow.
Mouthfeel: More carbonated than most quads,  but the fizzy nature helps to accentuate the deliciousness. Crisp.
Overall: I can't believe I hadn't tried this years ago. Unbelievable. 437 charactersdon1481, Dec 01, 2014

A: deep cola brown with tinges of ruby in the light, large but quickly dissipating head
S: like a belgian, but immediately like a very dank pilsner odd but pleasing and surprising, rich but thin, very pulled back tho, you have to really try on this one, a lot of malt in the nose
T: rich fruity and warm, malty but not overly so, a good bit of cherry astringency but in a pleasing way, a good subtle pucker at the end of the take, reminiscent of dark fruit but in a general sense not a specific one
M: luscious and creamy, coats the mouth, a tad thick but also pretty sharp immediately, the carbonation doesn't do it any immediate favors 
O: an exceptional beer but do not let it be your very first quad, then again if you've never had a quad have a dubbel first 889 charactersJackRWatkins, Nov 19, 2014

Mega complex and tasteful Belgian beer. Has flavor for days. Had a Boston bean taste, with dark fruit and banana on the back end.  I could probably pull flavors out for days, overall this Belgian beer is high volume and complex beyond imagination. Worth a pick up, even at steep price~ 459 charactersClePaul, Nov 09, 2014

4.85/5  rDev +8.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 511.2 oz bottle, poured into a bell glass at approximately 50 degrees F.
A: Pours like free-flowing molten caramel, and forms a massive four-finger frothy head that lasts a long while before eventually dying to a half-finger cap. Once in the glass, the beer becomes a thick, impenetrable fog of burnished bronze. The iPhone flashlight test reveals light seeping through only around the edges, which take on a ruddy-copper glow. Bubbles can be seen steadily rising from the bottom in that light. Impressive sheets of lacing cling to the glass.
S: That is a heady bouquet indeed. Sweetness and booze are the initial impression, wreathed through with an array of fruits - cherry, plum, grape, and something that reminds me of a nectarine, not unlike a particularly confused orchard, or one of those odd Frankentrees being created these days. There are some hints of caramelized malt sweetness beneath.
T: Quite in sync with the nose! I find myself struck right out of the gate with sugary sweetness wrapped around sweet boozy warmth, which fades slightly into the background as the rush of fruits thunder in. All the fruitiness of the aroma is present, along with some hints of over-ripe apple and dates. Malty sweetness can be detected, quietly filling in what few cracks and crevices the other flavors may have missed. The finish ends with a slight alcohol burn, which persists for a bit.
M: Creamy-smooth, lush, rich, and full, this is a joy on the palate and tongue.
O: I see why this beer receives the marks it does. While I am still more a fan of the St. Bernardus Abt 12, this is quite the malty, yeasty, satisfying experience. 1,635 charactersUrbanCaveman, Oct 29, 2014

5/5  rDev +11.9%This is one amazing beer.  Unbelievably good.  All the complex character of the best quads, this is a prize specimen of the Quadruple Ale family.  I just can't hold back a perfect score, because this is one of the few whose flaws I just cannot find.
It's got your belgian-quad banana flambé right at the intro, in the nose and on the tongue.  And so smooth for this big a beer.
Too easy to drink fast when it's right out of the fridge, this is a beer to savor.  Let it warm up so the transcendent experience lingers as long as possible.  As with all perfect score beers, this one just gets better as it approaches room temperature. 
Shame I've only found it in these little 0.33L bottles.  I would hoard magnums of this baby if they sold them.  This is Bond Villain quality beer, if you serve this to someone who is a true beer lover, you will gain major beer cred. 869 charactersMike-Harms, Oct 13, 2014

A:  A deep amber brown beer that poured with a good tan colored head.  The beer is cloudy and left good lacing down the glass as I drank
S:  The initial smell was dark fruits and a bit of booze.  You can smell the malt sweetness that awaits.  
T:  Huge flavor that improved and became more complex as I drank.  Some fruity yeast esters, some dark fruit like fig and plums.  Lots of sweetness and baked bread.  Wonderfully complex flavors from this one.
M:  Pretty highly carbonated with a smooth thick body.  Bit of boozy warmth as you drink
O:  The best Belgian Quad I've had, though I'll admit I haven't had a ton.  Even so, this was a fine world class beer that got better and better as I drank it. 732 charactersBrams17, Sep 23, 2014

4/5  rDev -10.5%Appearance – This beer is very dark, possibly one of the darkest I have ever come across  it is also cloudy and shows a good amount of carbonation and when held to the light it seems to eat it and get darker… 
Smell – The smell of sugar cane is heavy in this so it has a sweeter nose than the 8. The same fruit smells as the 8 are the next thing to hit you; apples, cherry, raisins, pear, apricots and dark fruit. There is also fig in there too I think. There is strong alcohol smell and mature malts in here as well. This is a very complex bouquet. 
Taste – This is very sweet compared to the 8, it is still good just maybe too sweet for me (not the style, it is still on point for that). The flavours of the fruit and the malts are still very much there but unlike the 8 they seem to get lost a little in the sweetness. 
Mouthfeel –  Carbonated tingle. The alcohol gives it boozy warmth with heavy linger.
Overall – This beer also brewed from malted barley and non-malted cereals, is sweeter in its smell and taste than the no 8. The first sip has serious nip of alcohol though still not over powering and there is a much sweeter taste to it than the no 8 so that this one is closer in flavour to a Leffe. Unlike a Leffe however the taste lingers for a while. Again proceed with caution this is a strong drink and should not be taken lightly. It also has a lot of bubbles so this one also tingles on the tongue. 1,429 charactersBeerDrinkersWorldTour, Sep 22, 2014

4.5/5  rDev +0.7%The beer appears to be a dark red/copper with a fleeting light brown froth which forms an even ring around the inside of the glass. Smells of intense licorice/anise with hints of warm spice and a wet earthiness. Tastes of warm brown sugar coated raisins. On the finish there is a light, dark, herbal taste with a hint of alcohol. The mouthfeel is noteworthy in that it is lighter than expected with noticeable carbonation. 422 charactersasmith55, Sep 19, 2014

4.25/5  rDev -4.9%Ok, not the style that I prefer, but I will give my honest opinion of the style and taste. Pours a decent creamy head at approx. 50 degrees F. Color is very deep and very little light is able to penetrate. Sediment is definately present and beer needs to settle after pouring because of the bottle conditioning. Aroma is of dark fruits and malt sweetness. Taste is full of raisins and malt sweetness. Balance is way better than I expected. Alcohol taste is definately present due to the 11.30% ABV. Overall, a great sipping beer, One is enough, but I will have to say, this is a world class beer 595 charactershophugger, Sep 19, 2014

3.75/5  rDev -16.1%Purchased from Brasserie de Rochefort Sept 14, 2014
A: The same huge foam head as the 6 and the 8 but with a slightly darker hue, tan or khaki color. Slightly less retention then its smaller brothers, it sustained for about a minute before falling. The beer is also darker with more woody brown and dark red. Almost opaque in appearance.
S: Sweetness is apparent in the nose and still on par with the other Rochefort beers but again – more evolved. Dark apples, cherries, plumes and raisins from the malt. Spicy hop aroma is mild and takes a backseat to the sweet malt. Esters are very low.. the spice might even be from the yeast.
T: The hop presence is much more noticeable in 10. Still spicy and noble but with more powerful bitterness that clings on to the end. Malt is also amped up in this version with the mallard type flavors coming through with bread crust and toast. Plumes, prunes and blackberries come to mind as I sip the beer as it warms. Not as much of the apple and berry as in the nose. Also getting some slight tobacco and cocoa flavors.
M: Carbonation is high with moderately large body. Alcohol warmth is moderate, there’s no drinking this one quickly.. Slightly harshness on the tongue, maybe from the hops used? But mostly in the finish. 
O: The malt profile of the beer reminds me of a barley wine, lots of plums/prunes/raisins with complexity for days, significant alcohol and sweetness to boot. 
Out of the three Rochfort efforts I’m going to have to say 8 is my favorite followed by 10 then 6.  I felt like 8 had a great balance of aroma / flavor and strength to carry this type of beer. The beer itself isn’t exactly my style, but when on a pilgrimage to some of the world’s most legendary breweries, you going to find some of them are more legend than anything else. 1,812 charactersguityler83, Sep 15, 2014

3/5  rDev -32.9%maybe i just had a bad/old bottle, but this was entirely too boozy to be very enjoyable. tasted like rum. i certainly want to revisit, as it had been a while since i had one, and this is not how i remembered it tasting. so take this review with a grain of salt. 261 characterstykechandler, Sep 14, 2014

4.25/5  rDev -4.9%The appearance is a solid brown with a very faint reddish hue to it. The head is big, bold, and tan.
The smell is very sweet and complex. It has a very strong fruit character to it, but malt and alcohol are also present.
The taste is very potent. There's a sweet maltiness up front followed by dried fruit: raisins, dates, fig. The alcohol is definitely detectable, but its masked very well. The strength and sweetness of it make it a sipping beer. The prominence of the different flavors shifts as it warms. The warmer it gets the more they seem to blend together.
It's a very smooth beer and the strong carbonation it has makes it quite smooth as well. There's a bit of a warming sensation on the tongue from the alcohol, but with no sting of booziness.
Overall it is an exceptionally well balanced beer, and truly surprising that it has such a high ABV. The particular fruit notes do not fit my personal taste, but it is undeniable the it is an artfully crafted beverage. 979 charactersChicagoMikeS, Sep 13, 2014

Deep mahogany red body with a thick, sticky, chunky head (4.5). Boozy, yeasty, doughy smell; rich caramel; raisins: brown sugar (4.5). Rich, creamy caramel flavors with a smoothly biting alcohol and hop bitterness edge; brown sugar with moderate phenols; lingering, satisfying aftertaste (4.75).

5/5  rDev +11.9%Rochefort 10 appears to be a beautiful dark sienna in color, translucent, and with a tan ring encircling the perimeter of the glass. Small bubbles can be seen rising to the surface, indicating some level of light carbonation. There is some very fine sediment, however it is to be noted that the beer is bottle conditioned and has been aged considerably.
The aroma is exotic and alluring... a perfect melange of plums, brown sugar, toffee, dark fruits, bready malts and a mossy earthiness. The flavor is quite multifaceted... A sweet maple syrup coats the palate, as a grape-like bitterness is there shortly after to provide balance. The heart of the flavor reminds this drinker of brown bread, with a lingering finish that is slightly crisp, peppery, and vinous. A pleasant tingle courses over the tongue. It's very full bodied and velvety, however the warming alcohol is hardly perceived anywhere near 11.3%.  
Ultimately, this is without question a world-class Belgian beer. A hallmark within the style, and a must for all beer enthusiasts and initiates to the style. 1,072 charactersNeorebel, Aug 22, 2014

4.44/5  rDev -0.7%look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.75Appearance: Pours very dark, you cannot see through it. I got some floaties that settled to the bottom. Not too attractive but also not a big deal for me. About a finger of head.
Smell: Dark fruit. Very pleasant.
Taste: Dates, plum , a little bit of sweetness. Raisin. I love it. There's a lot there and each sip introduces something a little different. No alcohol. 
Mouthfeel: A little heavy, with some good carbonation. Not the smoothest beer I've ever had.
Overall: Awesome, awesome beer. I'd like to compare this alongside a St. Bernardus 12 (at home, of course...don't want a DUI). It's a wonderful Quad. 613 charactersREGreenBTRB, Aug 07, 2014

Chilled it to about 60°, then poured into a tulip glass. Appearance dark brown with a bit of reddish hue, half inch of fine small bubbled head, and good lacing. Some yeast sediment which aided in dispersing carbonation. Smell is amazing. Great Belgian yeast Aroma, brown bread, dark cherries, and a hint of brown sugar. Taste is amazing. Complex, with dark fruits, cola, toasted brown bread, and grape nuts giving way to a tart cherry and dried plum, with a bit of alcohol heat, but not what you'd expect, considering the ABV. Finished sweet and rich, with a lingering raisin toast flavor that faded towards coffee and burnt sugar, in a good way. I believe that this is the best beer I have ever had, and I've had quite a few trippels and quads, but this is simply outstanding. Wish it was more readily available. 914 charactersMikeI, Jul 26, 2014

A - Ruby/Brown colour with nice two finger head of small bubbles.
S - Dates, caramel, port.
T - Caramel, molasses, Belgian yeast, dark fruit, and some sweetness. Very complex and absolutely delicious. For such a high alcohol content this beer does not taste 'boozy' at all. Incredible.
M - Rich and luxurious with great carbonation. Outstanding.
O - This is definitely one of my favourite beers of all-time. I love quads and this is one of, if not the best. 490 charactersBakaGaijin, Jul 26, 2014

5/5  rDev +11.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5ever since reading about Trappist beers, I've always wanted to get my hands on one. being that I come from a long line of priests and a bishop, it made the style even more intriguing. I figured I would never find one, at least in my area. well, I took a trip to ocean city, MD and made a stop at Anthony's with the intent on finding a bottle of something new. sitting on the top self was a bottle of the Trappist beer 2nd on my list, don't think I will ever see a westvletern XII. I couldn't wait to get home and try it! I poured it into a silver goblet used by my grandfather (who was a bishop). all I can say about this beer is it is truly amazing....everything about it! definitely at the top of my list. there's beers out there on my favorites that are based a lot off of my personal drinking experience. For instance, erdinger because of the one I had in a small bar in Munich that opened my mind to German beers and even rolling rock (yeah, its a favorite) because it reminds me of my grandfather. however, this beer is my number one solely on taste, can't imagine there's a better beer out there. 1,103 charactersflagbearer, Jul 21, 2014

The appearance is interesting. It has a nice head, the color looks nice, but MAN look at all that sediment! I've never seen that much sediment in a beer. It is everywhere. I looked in the bottle and there is a ton that didn't make it into the beer glass. It would have been worse. The look is not appealing at all. I have no problem with sediment but this is on a whole 'nother level! 
The taste is wonderful. It is a little boozy but it is 11.3% ABV. The flavor is mysterious. I saw another reviewer give a taste profile of "rum" and I'm totally getting that. There's a rum taste, dark fruit (raisin, cherry, prune), and malt. I love these sort of beers. The totally opposite of hoppy beer (YUCK!). No hop presence, just sweet maltiness. Delicious! 840 charactersFear4Beer, Jul 16, 2014

I've been waiting some time to test one of these and I have to say that the way was more than worth it. It's hard to not feel hyped when you crack one of these bottles open, but you can't let everything you've heard before bias you. Still, with a beer like this... all the recommendations in the world are unnecessary. A beer like this speaks for itself.
Poured into an Italian handmade glass tumbler, the first beer of my reviewing career to grace this lovely glass. 
A: This beer pours smooth and thick. It is a beer with a massive body, with an appearance almost thick like a syrup. A nice dark brown with shades of amber and red outlining the beer in the glass in its thinnest parts. The beer has a wonderfully buoyant and thick head like the creme on a cappuccino. The head is golden brown. This beer obviously was brewed with some highly active yeast - tons of residual bubbling occurs from deep within, though very little carbonation is in the tasting. Some nice little sediment in the bottom of the glass. The most visually appealing beer I have reviewed thus far. If it had more head lacing, I'd give it a perfect score.
S: A thick flavor from deep within, partially hidden by the thick frothy head. Smells of wood and molasses with a layering of rich malts and deep earthtones reminiscent of a fine cigar's wrapper. 
T: A wonderfully sweet but rich beer, high in alcohol concentration but low in "boozy" characteristic. The flavor is of caramel, honey and molasses over a bed of thick roasted malt. A light citrus surrounds the main body. Highly sweet, highly alcoholic and highly drinkable. The taste is incredibly palatable for a beer of this strength. Like a good espresso on the finish with a nice bright nose and very sweet flavor on the tongue.
M: Thick and mean, a wonderful head that retains in your mouth providing just enough of a creamy feel to the beer. Some carbonation but not much, which is surprising given the huge amount of happily active bubbles in the glass. A good soft finish with a crisp aftertaste that is sweet and delicious, like a sweetened coffee or espresso. 
O: This beer did live up to expectations. I am not a fan of beers that are best when served warm so I was glad to note that the Trappistes Rochefort 10 retained most of its delectable nuances at cold temperatures. It's thick, heavy, with a super strong ABV but not overpowering in any of the above categories. It is a drinkable beer (more than expected from a Belgian at 11.3% ABV) that has a nice sweet flavor that would pair with heavy foods such as steak or a good pasta dish. Not to be taken lightly or consumed before a hearty meal or followed by a lesser beer. This is a dessert beer, one to finish with, perhaps with a cigar or during captivating conversation with close friends. I would dare say this would be a better pairing with a fine steak than even the best cab. I look forward to reviewing more Belgians, especially those from Trappistes Rochefort. 3,087 charactersjsausley, Jul 14, 2014

Aroma is of raisins, prunes, cola and rum. Also smells boozy in a good way.
Taste is of rum, cola, raisins and alcohol. It is very warming and spicy and rich. Absolutely delicious and makes me want to drink it far quicker than you should!
Mouthfeel is very fizzy.
A delightful , complex, boozy Belgian strong dark ale. Not super hard to find and well worth trying for any Belgian beer fan. A must try in fact. Deserves its reputation as one of the greats.

4.97/5  rDev +11.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Much like the Chimay line of beers, and other Trappist brews, the blasé appearance of the bottle belies the complex flavor that lies within. It smells heavily like sugar, probably brown, and anise seed. It tastes heavily fruity, like a carbonated brandy, and is very yeasty. Goes pretty well with some Machego cheese and some hard salami. It's also got a pretty high alcohol content, around 11%, but the kick's somewhat delayed as it's just so darn tasty and toasty you don't really notice the wallop it packs 'til later. 522 charactersTheBeerLord, Jul 08, 2014

4.78/5  rDev +6.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5I'm just crossing off wanted brew after wanted brew these days and the prized Quadrupel for today is the ever popular Trappistes Rochefort 10. Yes, ever since my tongue first laid buds on a Quadrupel - I believe it was that likeable drop La Trappe Quadrupel - I've wanted to have at the venerated Rochefort 10, now my chance is at hand dear beer-lovers.
Poured from a 330ml bottle into a Chimay chalice.
A: Delicious murky chocolate brown body with some crazy yeast sediment action going on and as we all know - crazy yeast sediment action is good shit yo. There is a nice centimetre of a creamy tan head going on too. Damn. Fine. Quad.
S: So much good going on with the nose: Pear, plum, raisin, brown sugar and bread yeast make it a literal smorgasbord of smells. But it doesn't stop there - a creamy buttery diacetyl stamps its aroma down like a gauntlet saying "Come on, drink me you puny bastard!". With my meek reply being "Yes sir, Mr Rochefort 10 sir.".
T: Damn, damn, damn - this is a tasty Quad! Take everything I noted above minus the pear (replace it with baked apple) and we sir/ma'am, are in business. There is of course some boozy alcohol making itself well noted in the tonsil region (hey who are we kidding at 11.5% ABV there is little hiding the alcohol?).
M: Heavy and silky smooth. A tiny bit of cloying from the sugar, still it is near perfect.
D: In the wise words of Tina Turner: Simply the best, better than all the rest, better than any beer, any beer I ever met* I'm sorry to say I love this brew because it is in fact more pricey than Duvel, but what the hell I'm getting another and saving it for a rainy day.
Food match: Cheese platter is the obvious choice (the brewers themselves no doubt make cheese to pair with this beer - like most Trappists), however it would work well as an after-dinner replacement for brandy, and boeuf à la Bourguignonne or roasted wild boar.
*I may have elaborated on the lyrics to fit my review, deal. 1,969 charactersdoktorhops, Jul 05, 2014

S: Yeasty, Belgian candy sugar. Slightly roasty, lots of dark fruits and alcohol. Really a deep, complex smelling beer.
T: Wow. This beer packs a TON of flavor, and not totally in a good way. The beer has a punchy, medicinal quality to it that overlays all the other flavors. Behind that there are plums, toasted malts, and burnt sugars. But mostly what I taste is booze.
M: Slightly burning alcohol sensation in the mouth, body is quite thin.
O: I don't buy 11.3% ABV for a second. Rarely have I found anything (liquor included) that I would call "too boozy," but this beer is too boozy. It overwhelms the other flavors, and together they overwhelm the palette. Maybe it's just this batch, but I expected far better. 912 charactersDaveBlack, Jun 27, 2014

Served from the bottle into a 16oz libbey style glass. 
Poured a somewhat darker brown. Darker than I was expecting. Large beige colored head. If I had one complaint about this beer it would be that it is quite carbonated, at least the few bottles that I had. That's really the only thing keeping it from a perfect 5/5 score. 
Tastes of darker fruits and spices. Some traditional Belgian style citrus "snap" to it. 
Large body, it feels like a big beer. Some alcohol taste toward the finish but not overpowering. Overall this is absolutely in my top 10. 634 charactersgrimmgreen, Jun 25, 2014

A: fruity. Black cherry skin. Fresh ripe plum. Alcohol. 
M: nice carbonation. More thin than anticipated. 
T: Bready malts. Burnt sugar. Cherries. Definitely some booze and warming. Became a little one note as it warmed. Not much complexity. 
Overall: I've had this beer a few times but it's much more boozy then I remembered it being. Nice quad but nothing special.

3.97/5  rDev -11.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Pours dark, opaque brown with thick tan head. Nose is mostly dominated by fruit. Smells of cherry, plum, and some yeast. Really has my mouth watering. Taste is intense. Not getting any of the stone fruits until right towards the end. Starts with a hint of malt sweetness, proceeds very, very quickly to a facepunch of alcohol. The 11.3% ABV is no secret here. Mouthfeel is as full as you would expect from a quad. Overall, the alcohol was maybe a bit too assertive for me, but it mellowed as the beer got closer to room temp. Not an every day drinker for me, but next to a nice meal, this would be quite nice. 609 charactersslackattack, Jun 19, 2014

3.43/5  rDev -23.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3 | feel: 3 |  overall: 3.5Could have sworn I reviewed this one before but who needs an excuse to review a quad for another time. 
A-Poured into a snifter from a fresh bottle with a BB date of 1/29/2019. 3 fingers of a big bubbled tan head with some heft marshmallows out of the glass. It rather quickly recedes to a finger of sticky lace. That characteristic ruddy brown color with plenty of yeasty haze present.
S-Cold the aroma is sweet and fruity with hints of soft and spicy alcohol. Notes of raisin, plum and dried cherries. Malt is bready with a bit of caramel.
T-Taste is like the aroma but more subdued. Alcohol flavor is a little strong and there is a hint of skunkiness in the finish. As it warms it smooths out a bit. 
M-The alcohol bite is stronger than my favorite 2 versions of this style (St. Bernardus and Westy). Dry finish but also has a linger to it that I don't love.
O-I've always thought this version was a clear step below my 2 favorites but this time it tastes worse than I remember with more alcohol bite and even a hint of skunkiness that I've never gotten out of a quad before. I have several more bottles that I'll have to try and perhaps age a couple to see if it calms down a bit. I'll give it a score somewhere between my previous impression and this bottle and if the other bottles taste better refresh my ratings.
I love this style of beer. 1,353 charactersdeebo, Jun 17, 2014

S: 4 Pretty mild. Getting some vanilla, Belgian yeast, and a good amount of booze. Some dark fruits are there too, but they’re faint behind the yeast.
T: 4.5 Really nice as it sits and warms up. Not too sweet or boozy considering the high ABV. There’s a lot of malt and Belgian yeast with dark fruits and vanilla. It’s a bit subtler than other quads, but everything works well together. There’s also some mild spice (cloves, pepper, etc.) at the end.
M: 4.5 Good viscosity and not dry at all. Each sip leaves you wanting more. 
O: 4.25 A great quad. One of the best examples of the style. The flavors (and especially the aroma) are a bit too mild for me, so I think I prefer St. Bernardus Abt 12. 831 charactersTele, Jun 16, 2014

A: Cloudy, deep brown with ruddy undertones. A off-white head with a rocky appearance. minor legs, minimal lacing and a thin disk hangs around for all the way after head collapses.
S: Tart cherries. Bananas. candi sugar and bready yeast. Lightly toasted caramel notes hint at the quality and complexity of the malts.
T: Perfect. Follows nose and gives a burst of clove like notes in addition to the nose. A hint of the sourness rushes in and slams the tongue with fervor, then sweet, then yeast, then sweet....amazing how it plays and wanes and waxes and wanes again.
M: Medium-full and slightly heavy on front, then malts come in and go full-on. Carbonation does not yield to a lighter feel, malts on finish slam the heaviness home.
O: Holy crap. I should have tried this a long time ago. Wonderful, if expensive. Worth the expense, IMO, for an occasional treat. Try it. 902 charactersScrapss, Jun 15, 2014

S: Not as complex as I would have thought. Alcohol is noticeable. Some vinous aromas come through as well. As it warms the aroma begins to shine more though. Bakers yeast and fig come through and the beer changes a fair bit. Lost points for very noticeable alcohol.
T: Very complex, but once again let it warm. Caramel and brown sugar come through. A bit of nuttiness that I have detected in the 8 makes it self present and is one of the breweries traits that I love. Sweet yet balanced nicely. Bready as it warms. A bit of hops too. I would imagine something like saaz. Not to much but just a subtle flavor and appropriate bitterness. Grape and wine like qualities come through as well. Alcohol is noticeable but its not extremely powerful.
M: Very nicely carbonated. Body is still very drinkable despite the high abv. 
O: An extremely complex beer. That being said I prefer the 8 because i find it has everything I love in this beer but minus the killer ABV and it has a bit more of a nutty flavor. Great beer though and a true classic, would be even better no doubt with some age. 1,249 charactersHaydn-Juby, Jun 13, 2014

Appearance - Woah, floaties! Dark, brown and murky with lots of little black sand-like floaties mixed with a few light brown, larger floaties suspended and swirling around. Massive brown-ish head with awesome retention and lacing. Is this what this brew is supposed to look like??? Looks way impressive but a little scary. I tried to get my gf to try and she was too scared.
Smell - Candy-like clove, cinnamon, and other assorted spices. Hints of dark, dried fruits. Has that unique Belgian yeasty quality for sure.
Taste/Feel - Taste is just like the nose but so much more intense; Belgian yeast, dark/dried candied fruits, spices, maybe a hint of cocoa, buttery, and other complexities I can't quite put my finger on. The alcohol is so well integrated/hidden it's scary. The feel is just absolutely sublime; my first perfect 5 rating on anything, it's just super smooth and full bodied richness. The carbonation is just scrubbing enough to eliminate any possibility of this beer being cloying.
Overall - An epic brew; easily one of the tastiest beers I've had so far. So full bodied and rich...so complex. At a seemingly non-existent 11.3% ABV, this bad boy is straight up dangerous. If it wasn't $5 for that 12 oz bottle I'd buy a whole lot more regularly. What's up with the chunky mud look though? Makes me wonder if I had an old bottle or something: I'll just have to buy more and see. If It was an old bottle - I can say this brew ages beautifully. 1,489 charactersRedneckwine, Jun 13, 2014

Even more than just being one of my favorites (if not my absolute favorite), it has amazing value in that it is pretty easy to convert people with. Grab a couple of bottles (or a pitcher if you find it) and please share with others. It is one of those beers that everyone can find different flavors and aromas in that are not overly offensive, especially considering the high abv. 
I think the only reason I don't look for it every day is simply because of how easy it is to come across. I don't know if I have ever been wowed like this before. 578 charactersckocay, Jun 11, 2014

Dark fruits, cloves, raisins, brown sugar and banana on the nose. Café Kulminator serves almost all their beers at perfect temperature so there doesn't seem to be too much discrepancy in the aroma department with the passage of time.
Lots of figs and dark fruit inundate the tongue upon first sip. I keep expecting for something more complex to follow but am left hanging as the only thing that really seems to remain is some booziness and the heavy sticky residuous feeling that sugar leaves behind.
Surprisingly light bodied, but the amount of carbonation hadn't changed much from the younger versions of this brew that I've tried over the years.
This particular iteration of Rochefort aged in the worst way imaginable, at least by my standards -- it went from being a very complex brew to something closer to being two-dimensional. 908 charactersamano_h, Jun 08, 2014
4.5/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75I am very curious to review this beer. It is supposed to be one of the best, that is one reason. Second reason; Yesterday I reviewed number 8 and I a was very pleasantly surprised by it. I drink blonde beers and tripels most of the time, and dark beers are usualy not my thing (so I thought ;))Okay, let's go..
It is very dark, like coffee. So dark, that I can't detect bubbles. The head is pretty big,  but is reduced quickly.
The smell I find surprisingly fresh and light. figs, brown sugar and spices at the back.. also some raisin, wood and fresher notes. strawberry, apple, blueberry and there is coffee
The taste is amazing. It has the same quality of Rochefort 8 of bringing out all the flavours at the same time, therefore it is hard to describe what is actually 'happening'. I will try it anyway ;). 
The carbonation level is just right, not to much. It is sweet, but in a way that fruit is sweat. You can put sugar in you coffee, and a point will come when it becomes to much. But have you ever tasted fruit that was too sweet? No way. Now that is the kind of sweet you get from this beer. Yes, it's sweet, but in a GOOD way, You get a punch of alcohol immediately. It is very up front, but it doesn't overlap the rest of the flavours. There is licorice, blueberry, strawberry again, caramalized suger with some coffee figs, and spices. Bit of hop taste.
Boy, do I like this beer. With it's 11,3 percentage of alcohol it is so f...king heavy, but still it is very drinkable... very drinkable. Cheers. 1,515 charactersarthurspoor, Jun 07, 2014

Appearance: Poured an opaque muddy purple brown, with sediment on the bottom. 
Smell: Raisins, spice, dark chocolate. Definitely more pronounced near room temp.
Taste: Sweet but not cloying, dark fruits such as plum and cherry. Plenty of malt.
Mouthfeel: Thick but smooth, almost creamy. The high ABV is hidden well. Warming sensation but no strong alcohol taste.
Overall: A prime example of the style, very drinkable. Expensive but worth every penny. What all Quads aspire to be. 645 charactersMordath, May 25, 2014

The taste is subtle and smooth, taste like heaven in a glass with a rich texture and a lovely mouthfeel. The taste lingers for a while allowing you to mellow in it as you slowing consume the goblet, never wanting this to end. 581 characterseypmcfg, May 22, 2014

Lot's of brown sediment at the end and tons of white particles and bits throughout the beer. The first thing I notice is the 10% abv. Wow this thing has a kick. Has great mouthfeel and the beer really coats your entire mouth. Goes down smooth with a very strong alcohol burn. Lot's of substance. A great magnificent beer. 379 charactersRichardbeerlover, May 15, 2014

Strong carbonation produced a tall, bubbly head that recedes rather quickly into a skim. The beer is a deep brown color with orange highlights. Cloudy. The beer leaves nice lacing, but it doesn't really stick to the glass.
S - Nice firm aroma. I'm picking up the dark fruits that I expect, but they're stronger and sweeter than some other quads I've tried. I'm even picking up some fairly distinct chocolate notes. Touch of alcohol.
T - Follows the nose. The sweetness of the dark fruit character is amplified and the chocolate comes through on the finish. The alcohol is present here, and also comes through on the finish, but as more of an exclamation point on the flavors, rather than just an alcoholic presence.
M - Rich and luxurious with ample carbonation. Really gives me something to swirl around. The alcohol on the finish also gives the beer a great zip at the end. Finishes clean. No funkiness or lingering sourness. What more could one ask for?
O - Excellent beer. The only fault that I can find with it is that it is too sweet for me. And it's expensive. But it made a great dessert for me last night! I think this site has it right. Don't miss this beer if you have an opportunity to pick one up. 1,268 charactersAndrew041180, May 12, 2014

It pours a nice brown beer with a tan foamy top that dissipates after a few minutes. Thre is a very faint aroma, mostly malt and yeast, raisins and caramel. Taste is good, a bit of brandy that lingers and sweetness. Easy to drink, very light. Not syrupy at all. 
If it wasn't for the strong alcohol taste, I could drink more than one. 378 charactersJulioH, May 09, 2014

S: Raisins, currants and caramel. Not overpowering but a very important part of the overall experience.
T: An other-worldly experience. Only a hint of the alcohol. The taste begins with the raisin smell as you begin to swallow and lasts long after. The tastes lingers at least another five seconds after you swallow. It really is a unique experience.
M: Like a fine scotch, the taste melts in your mouth and hits all parts of the palate.
O: Simply amazing. Easily one of the best beers I have ever had. Spent well over a half out savoring every sip. If you can get this, do. Every beer lover must experience it. Make sure you give it ample time to warm up. Do not drink it cold. Upper 50s is a decent temperature. 866 charactersSeanem44, May 04, 2014

Smell is of dark fruit, banana, clove, wonderful unique yeastiness, bread, and this rank, dank smell as if you could smell the color red and brown, that may sound weird, but yeah, its this strong yeast originated smell that fulfills a nice yeasty grainy beer smell that you would want to smell.
Taste is the same with yeast dominating, along with dark fruit like prunes and dates, as well as figs and rye. The complexity is bewildering. I love it. Not much of hops to speak of, just a tad of bitterness in there to balance everything out.
Feel is nice , can't get much better.
Overall I love this beer, as I cannot find an equal in style from America. This is unique and fulfilling in every way. 776 charactersBastardKing24, May 03, 2014

Smell: 3.75- Pleasant -but subdued-- bouquet of sweet malt and a slight hoppiness. I also detect a lambic-type yeast scent and a very brief hint of cherry.
Taste: 4.0- Front is slightly sweet with a noticeable taste of barley. Middle has a slight acetone taste with subtle hints of dried fruits. Finish features a return of the barley malt, along with a hint of caramel. Aftertaste is short and somewhat dry.
Mouthfeel: 3.75- Somewhat dry in the mouth, with a bit too many bubbles for the style.
Overall:4.0- In spite of all its less than perfect notes, this is a truly outstanding beer and better taken as a whole than as the sum of its parts. Refreshing, somewhat dry and without a hint of the 11% ABV it packs, this an excellent Belgian beer and while not the best example of the style, it is still worth a try if you have never sampled it before. 990 charactersBeerDocT, Apr 30, 2014

A: Brownish in hue with a tannish head, enjoyed the yeasts swirling at the bottom of the glass settling after the pour. 
B: Smelled like fruity yeast to me; very appealing. 
T: Pleasant taste, could identify the heavier nature of the Quad, but still well balanced. Hints of fruit sweetness within. 
M: Smooth with slight effervescence, again well balanced feel while drinking.

Smells of oak, and malt with little the the tartness of unripe fruit, beautiful complex bouquet of aromas.
Tastes pairs wonderfully with the smell, oak forward with a milk chocolate body and malt backbone.
Mouthfeel is light for such a high abv feel with strong carbonation.

S- Plum, fig, raisin, chocolate, dried apricot, and caramel. Not overly powerful, but nice. 
T- Holy S**t. This is one of those beers that tries to defy logic. Beautiful flavors. Perhaps the most balanced beer I've ever put in my mouth. I laugh after every sip, because it takes a full 5-6 seconds for a huge rush of chocolate to materialize in your mouth after you've swallowed. How in the hell does that happen? I'll leave it up to the other reviewers to point out the flavors. All I can say is this thing is a symphony. 
M- The texture and carbonation perfectly match the flavors its supporting. Drying, but not overly so. My only complaint is it gets a touch too heavy after it has warmed. 
O- There's a reason this is considered one of the best beers in the world. And make no mistake, it is. In my experience, this is one of the most brilliantly crafted beers I've ever had. 4.75 992 characterstmm313, Apr 26, 2014

A - The body is a wonderful burnt sienna color. The head is effervescent and dissipates quickly.
S - The smell is intensely sweet, with plum, apricot, candy sugar, and freshly-kneaded dough notes.
T - Remarkably complex and balanced! I immediately pick up brown sugar, fig, plum, and an almost almond-like nuttiness. The yeasty flavors of the beer are fantastic. The finish is boozy, but not intimidating. 
M - Medium bodied. Hard to believe this is an 11% ABV beer! The carbonation is lively and fizzy.
O - This beer does pretty much everything right. You can tell this recipe has been carefully crafted by the monks over the centuries. It does not disappoint. The beer hides the high alcohol incredibly well. A bottle of this would be divine with a slice of Belgian chocolate cake... 822 charactersporter_collie, Apr 24, 2014

S: Raisins, figs, chocolate, and a nearly infinite deepness of rich Belgian-style ale.
T: All of the above elements, with a lifting taste of alcohol that adds both a bitterness and a sweetness that sticks to you in a delightful way. Elements of a finer wine or a port in the bite, but with the same multi-layered complexity of other Belgian ales that introduces its merits in stages. Overall, fantastic. A real treat, and likely the best beer I've had so far (no small feat!). It felt like a gift to drink.
M: Thick and engaging. The alcohol tastes warmed while its smoothness enriched. Amazing.
O: This would be a great after dinner drink, but it could fit anywhere, really. Delicious and satisfying, and very drinkable for the ABV. I'd reccomend this to anybody who loved beer. I'll definitely be buying more. A+ 975 charactersAlpacaAlpaca, Apr 16, 2014

Yes the ABV % is high but the flavor of this brew is full variety of flavors. It has a very smooth texture for me. The sediment is also interesting, it has a nice coloration and once it hits you towards the end of the drink it adds a subtle complex flavor that can only be expected from a trappist. Some trappist style brews do not have as nearly the great flavor as this one does, so this one for me is a favorite among trappist style brews. 528 charactersSovietBear1982, Apr 16, 2014

A: Pours a lovely dark brown mahogany with about an 1/8th inch tan head that quickly fades to a light lacing
S: Belgian-y yeast characteristics, but definitely not overwhelming. Enticing hints of caramel maltiness with some dark fruit and dates lingering in the background
T: Almost don't know where to begin here, Definitely still a little bit of that wonderful yeastiness, morphing quickly toward the maltier side with some dark fruits and caramelized sugar coming forward a little bit. Very well balanced, absolutely no way to tell there's any alcohol at all - impressive for 11.3%
M: What one expects from a Belgian, certainly on the thinner side when compared to the really dense beers, but well carbonated and certainly not too thin, again, well balanced.
O: Although there isn't any aspect of this beer that I would say is the best for any beer that I have ever had, it is so well balanced and continuously brings hints of new and intriguing flavors that all work so well together, for that reason this is one of the best beers I had had in recent memory. 1,104 characterstopace, Apr 16, 2014

Alcohol's apparent on the nose, also sour cherries.
Brown sugar with a malty, faintly chocolate, fig-like, pear-ish stain. Awfully rich, even for a quad but still doesn't knock out the palette. There's a delicate burn on the finish. Leaves nothing to be desired, honestly.
Well carbonated, heavy, dense beer. 426 characterspants678, Apr 13, 2014

The brew has a murky rust color with chunks and specs of yeast suspended around. Nice frothy khaki head. No lacing. Aroma is plums, cherry skins, booze. Tastes of plums, light cocoa, a nice light bitter balance, apricot, vanilla bean. Medium bodied, a wee bit over carbonated but not undrinkable. Very solid quad 496 charactersstumac, Apr 10, 2014

A thick, creamy head with tons of retention, as is to be expected (though it often feels like a pleasant surprise, somehow haha). Decent lacing when the head finally subsides a bit. A beautiful looking beer. 
S Boozy up front--almost like a port, though with a touch more sweetness. It's like a god damn vineyard in there--a little bit of viney, resinous vegetation beneath a layer of dark fruit, followed by
the backend of malt and yeast and bread. 
T This is bigger and brighter than I anticipated. There is a big burst of fruit in the front end, followed by a wine wash that tastes of desert wine. The booze follows afterwards, and then comes the malty sweetness. The alcohol definitely cuts the sweetness, but not so much that it overpowers. This is delightfully balanced. 
M The beer is velvety and PERFECTLY carbonated. I love everything about the mouthfeel. 
O I love this beer. I wish I had tried it sooner. This is a perfect end of the day, after a meal drink. 1,023 charactersBingCrosby7, Apr 04, 2014

Wow this bottle has everlasting head. Poured a solid three fingers and dissapated to a 1/2 finger layer that has refused to leave. Pours a very murky brown. Aroma has lots of brown sugar, caramel, and some vanilla mixed with fruit, some sort of dried candied fruit - plum perhaps. Taste is quite pleasant. Lots of sweetness but not overdone and is certainly well balanced - follows the nose very well. Delicious! 472 charactershops202, Apr 01, 2014

Aroma is not strong, but smells sweet, lemony and malty.
Taste is herbaceous and malty. Hint of bitter fruit, like not quite ripe pear.

4.5/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I picked up a bottle of Brasserie de Rochefort's Trappistes Rochefort 10 a couple weeks ago for $6.99 at The Lager Mill. I've been meaning to try this beer for a long time and I decided it was time to stop procrastinating and give this beer a try, so lets see how it goes. Best by 11/27/16. Poured from a brown 11.2oz bottle into a Belgium chalice.
A- The label looks ok, it's very simple and plain looking and I don't think it's too eye catching. It poured a nice dark brown color that didn't really let any light come through and it had one and a half fingers worth of creamy tan head that died down to a thin ring and it left some nice rings of lacing behind. This is a very good looking quad, I have no complaints at all.
S- The aroma starts off with a lower amount of high sweetness that has a nice brown sugar like aspect to it and it's followed by the malts being the first to show up and they impart a nice toffee and caramel like aroma with some vanilla showing up in the background. Up next comes the fruits that have a nice dark fruit aspect that is a little brighter than normal and it works really nicely with the malty aromas. This beer had a very good aroma, I really enjoyed it.
T- The taste seems to be pretty similar to the aroma and it starts off with a lower amount of high sweetness that's followed by malts still showing up first and they impart the same aspects that they did in the aroma with a nice combination of caramel and vanilla seeming to stick out the most. Up next comes the dark fruits which are just as bright as they were in the aroma, but this time there's also a apple aspect thrown into the mix. On the finish there's a light alcohol flavor that's hidden pretty well and there's just a little bit of bitterness on the finish with a sweet, caramel, vanilla, and fruity aftertaste. This was a very nice tasting beer, I have no complaints at all.
M- Smooth, clean, a little rich, a little creamy, on the thicker side of being medium bodied with a slightly lower amount of medium carbonation. This beer had a very good mouthfeel, it worked very well with this beer.
Overall I thought This was very good beer and a very good example of a quad it had pretty much all the aspects that I look for in the style, but I still found it to be pretty unique for the style and it kind of has it's own thing going on that i haven't seen in other quads. This beer had good drinkability, it was smooth, clean, a little rich, a little creamy, a little filling and the tasting did a great job at holding my attention, I would be pretty happy sipping on a couple of these especially on a cold winter night. What I like the most about this beer was how it wasn't like a lot of quads that I've had but it still stayed very true to style. What I liked the least about this beer was nothing, it is a little expensive, but that's to expected with most of these good Belgian beers. I would for sure buy this beer again, I would like to keep a couple in the cellar, but the price would prevent me from buying a lot of it. I would recommend this beer to just about anyone, I think every craft beer drinker should try this beer. All in all I was pretty impressed with this beer, I have no clue why it took me so damn long to try this beer, but I'm glad i finally did and I won't be sleeping on the one anymore. So far this just might be my favorite Quad and it's for sure one of the best ones I've have had. The only one from them I have left to try is the 8 so I will have to pick one of those up soon. Great job guys, I really enjoyed this beer, keep up the great work. 3,585 charactersStoutHunter, Mar 14, 2014

A nose of luscious caramel, touch of booze and a bit of raisin and fig. A bit of sweet chocolate on the nose and soft peat. The taste is generous with malt sweetness. Luscious caramel, molasses, raisin, fig and and earthiness that isn't any dark malt flavor like coffee or chocolate. it;s soft. Mouthfeel is full but drinks lightly with plenty of carbonation to tickle. A mysterious drying. At some point in the beer the palate has become dry and you are left to wonder why. Sweetness from alcohol and a bit of alcohol dryness in the finish.

4.39/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25Pours an opaque deep brown with caramel highlights and more beige, dense, creamy head than body. Thick sheets of lacing line the glass walls. The head lingers and is so dense, it climbs above the rim.
Prunes, raisins, figs, bruised apple and burnt sugar form the initial aroma. Gives the impression of a rum-soaked fruitcake. Notes of cola add complexity.
Flavor is intensely sweet and bready, with prunes, pear, banana, and raisins underlying. Toasted, caramelly malt forms the backbone, but the dark fruit character dominates. The finish is slightly dry and boozy.
Body is on the full side, with low carbonation and noted alcohol warmth.
Very complex, estery character, with enough alcohol to warm the belly, but not detract from the experience. Truly a beauty of a beer. 777 charactersbarczar, Mar 09, 2014

S: New to trying put names to smells in beers, but I get some plum and what I'll call other dark fruit, and a breaded smell. Not an explosion of different smells to me, but enjoyable none the less.
T: Taste follows the nose without the bread, with the alcohol being the main addition. Smelled a little better than it tasted to me which I guess means the alcohol did not benefit the taste. 
M: Bubbly effervescent as I'm accustomed to and enjoy with the style and enjoyable. Not experienced enough doing reviews to nail down why I know I prefer the Westy 12 mouthfeel to this.
O: A great example of the style, and a quality brew. Overall ranking likely impacted by this not being my favorite style of beer. 880 charactersWolberjs, Mar 06, 2014

T- Awesome. So very good. Balance of sweet and complex.
M- Some tang. Some smack. Lots of complexity, but overall, pure balance.
O- One of the best beers I've ever had. Certainly worth a try to the novice trappist drinker. 407 charactersstoutmasterjames, Mar 02, 2014

The beer itself is an obscure dark purplish brown with bits of yeast gobules in it. The beer has a fairly complex smell to it. A hoppy smell dominates the nose but with notes of dark fruits. The dark fruits appear to be prunes but are very faint. In addition to hops and dark fruits, the smell has a fairly peppery and salty smell as well as hints of sugar to it. The taste resembles the smell fairly strongly. The taste has a stronger pepper taste with hints of hops but with faint traces of dark fruits. The taste is fairly complex with subtle notes that can easily escape a person's palate if they're not too careful. The mouthfeel is fairly surprising. The beer itself is heavy bodied with a surprising amount of carbonation but feels light compared to other Quads. Overall ,a very good beer and worth getting and enjoying. 890 charactersHattedClassic, Feb 27, 2014

Not a beer worth waiting for. Of the big three (Westy 12 and st. Bernardus 12), this was my last to taste and I have finally come to realize when it comes to the quads, each bottle is a different experience....so here is this one.
A: almost perfect. Looks like a glass of cola.
S: after the pour, it had the aroma of cherry cordial. With some warming it was almost of a bourbon quality.
T: fig was the dominate flavor for me followed by grapes, definitely of the concord variety.
M: my lowest rating, smooth but almost a touch too carbonated.
I loved and definitely respected this beer but was not blown away. If I didn't have Westy first maybe I would feel different but the carbonation level is what holds back the higher rating. 820 charactersJC333, Feb 17, 2014

4.6/5  rDev +2.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured into my dads tulip/snifter like Maudite glass. A beer of this caliber does not rear its head this often. Or at least, it shouldn't. I find it a bargain at almost $7. Actually, it should cost much, much more. I find myself at a lack of words worthy to describe this offering. It is so simple, yet so complicated. This brew makes me sad. Only because of the many may which try this and not understand. Sometimes I think that I might not understand. This is no ordinary "beer"...This is other-worldly. It is so good that I feel that I may not be worthy of it! You know the words on the Ruination and Arrogant Bastard bottles that say things like 'this is a liquid poem', and 'you are not worthy'? This applies here more than there. This is truly divine and a privilege to drink. While I could only drink this and only this for the rest of my life, I would never do so. It is to be reserved for special occasions and times of celebration, or if you happen to be a monk on 40 day fast. (Got it for my birthday, and Im not even sure that qualifies!) But alas, I must review.
A- Appearance is really quite something. It is a clear deep amber brown color, and here and there it gets darker and then lighter as it pours, due to the yeast. I love how much yeast is suspended in it. Truly a thing of beauty, there is not too much in there, but just enough to stay apparent and noticed throughout. Thick, off white head, nice and fluffy. I really think there is going to be a lot more head than there ever is, but it is balanced and consistent in every bottle I have ever had. Great lacing, the head thins a bit as it warms, but it stays with it the whole duration. When held up to the light it is a beautiful amber brown. The yeast never seems to settle, it almost as if this brew has a consciousness and is alive!
S- What a glorious aroma! Again, very simple, yet very complex! I get a lot of dark fruit such as figs and currants, I get just a hint of dark red wines and maybe some plums, but I could just be inventing that... Its just heavenly. Deep maltiness that goes on and on. A sweet caramel is there. There is a touch of floral and bitter hoppiness that blends in well with the rest of the flavors. Yeast is an apparent source of these aromas. I do detect an alcohol smell, but its not enough to throw off anything else going on. It all seems to play well off of one another and is just incredible. If I had to choose one word, again and again, it is balance.
T- I am really having trouble putting this into words. I can compare it to the smell, but I feel like that description is either over doing it, or is not doing enough! Sweet caramel, figs, dark currants, raisins, dates, doughy-bread, yeast-forward-red-wine-esque flavors going on... It is truly incredible.
EDIT: I cant believe I forgot to add this part! I was so excited to review! haha
M- I had already finished my review when I took another sip and started to describe it to myself and realized I did not put my thoughts in the actual review! 
Mouthfeel- Balanced is a word that normally lacks for me in a multitude of beer, simply because I go for either more Hop or Malt forward brews. But with this particular offering, balance is the name of the game. It is not thin by any means, but I would not consider it thick either. It is just a hint under what I consider "chewy", it is definitely full bodied. This is a "big" beer, and I think the monks hit it square on by making sure it could help sustain them by replacing meals. It makes me want to try doing just that! It is that good, and I can easily say it would replace a steak for my tastes any day. Thank you, all Trappist monks everywhere. 
Overall, this is probably the best beer all around I can honestly say I have ever had. It is the most balanced, delicious satisfying beer I have ever consumed. I have never had a Westy 12, but I seriously doubt it could top this. 
Again, it makes me sad that few will be able to appreciate something like this as I have, and continue to. This is a dream in a bottle. It is what few men can even begin to believe they can achieve. It is a goal, it is a gift. It is the essence of a craft, and a thrill to have experienced. The last time I felt something that I can compare to the feeling I get when I drink this is called love.

Deep dark cola murky brown with some carbonation apparent. Thin taupe foam layer, nice lacings.
Aroma of dark, rich fruits of raisins and figs. Sweet malts.
Smooth, sweet tAste of raisins, sweet malts. Alcohol on the back of the tongue but, despite its 11.3% abv, the alcohol is not overbearing. Smooth, dark fruit aftertaste. Heavy mouthfeel with tiny bubbles.

S - Sweet and malty, but the smell dissipates quickly. I was a bit surprised that the smell wasn't that strong. 
T - Malty and smooth with a bit of a sweetness and chocolate taste. The alcohol taste is prominent. Finishes with a very mild bitter aftertaste. Taste, overall, is balanced and very pleasant. 
M - Somewhat thick, if not a heavy medium. Strong burn from the alcohol and a bit from the carbination. 
O - Flavors are very balanced, and, aside from the smell not being very strong, just an amazing beer. 714 characterssilverblaze540, Feb 13, 2014

Appearance: Deep dark brown, large tan head that fades to covering after it settles.
Flavor: Fruity plum, raisins, toasted almond, chocolate, cola. As it warms more of the roasted malt begins to show through.
Mouthfeel: Medium to light body, smooth, slight alcohol warming on throat. 
Overall: This beer is amazingly smooth and almost too hard to describe, it's just so balanced, smooth, fruity, roasted perfection. The high alcohol is only noticeable as a slight warming and does not show through in the flavor. Excellent beer. $7.59 for 330ml 709 charactersbuzzardman, Feb 11, 2014

I was expecting to not be blown away, but I was blown away. 
Wonderful dark fruit aroma - raisin & figs as expected. Some lighter citrus notes that were an unexpected and very pleasant surprise. 
Taste and mouthfeel was phenomenal. Velvety smooth. Rum soaked raisin. Sweet but not too much so. A slight warming on the throat, otherwise the alcohol was totally hidden. Amazing balance.

The fruitiness of this beer is in the front. But it's gets more complex set of flavors after the head sets in which it went fast . I think it's a tad sweet for my liking. I would recommend you let it sit for a few minutes before drinking. Cheers 356 charactersj2beer, Feb 08, 2014

a- very murky, dark plum color with a one finger tan head. sediment floating around
s- very complex, but not very strong aroma. Plum, fig, malt, and yeasty
t- follows the smell. dried fruit, malt, and unmistakable Belgian yeast and candy sugar
m- moderately heavy, smooth, and silky
o- I ordered this at an early family dinner not realizing the alcohol content until a few sips in. I started to feel the magic of this wonderful brew after only a few sips. besides a slight warming effect, you really don't taste the alcohol. my only complaint is the aroma could be a little stronger. other than that, the taste and mouthfeel are just what I expected from a trappist beer. will definitely have it again. 804 charactersTomis, Feb 07, 2014

4.84/5  rDev +8.3%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Bottle purchased for $3.65 CDN from LCBO during Seasonal feature. Served chilled into an oversized wine glass.
Appearance - A murky brown color spills out from the bottle creating a 2 finger head that lingers for a long while while the ivory cap rests on top. Once the head eventually recedes, there is a dense soapy collar that assists in leaving beautiful lacing around the glass. Mostly clear with little evidence of bubbles and some sediment pours out the farther into the glass you go.
Smell - Brilliantly, sweet aromas like the finest desserts in the highest end restaurants. The funky Belgian yeast smell is there with a slightly cooked brown sugar delectable aroma. I picked up some trace dark fruits namely prunes and plums (and maybe some figs), but overall the sweet dessert aroma overwhelms and is astonishingly appetizing.
Taste - Not nearly as sweet as the aroma would indicate, there's a fine blend of nuts (pecans?) blended with the ever so slightly sweet bready dessert tray in the nose. There's also an earthy bitterness that underscores the whole experience. Delightfully complex and a real treat to savor. The alcohol is very well hidden. What balance.
Mouthfeel - Smooth, rich, perfectly balanced in body as it's full and velvety yet not overkill either. Dry finish but not to much, everything here just seems ... right.
Overall - I had this for the first time a few months ago out of a chilled bottle poured into proper glassware and it captured my imagination completely. Upon a repeat purchase (well actually 1 of 6 bottles since Rochefort 10 is seasonal around these parts), It lived up to the expectations I maintained for every bottle of this world-glass beer as constructed in my head based on that first experience last summer. A true treat (for my birthday this time) worthy of all the praise it gets and a beer that you shouldn't miss the opportunity to try if you get the chance. 1,916 charactersDenisKolkin, Feb 06, 2014

A: Poured a deep amber and murky with very little head, with sediments floating in the foam (what head there was).
S: Had a strong grape smell to me. More like a low end merlot. Not what I was expecting at all. Don't get me wrong, I love a good wine (Napa Valley is on my bucket list), just not when I want a great beer. 
T: Very malty, but not good malty. Reminds me of the Mickey's I drank when I was a teen. I don't get anything from this but alcohol and Mickey's. I'm trying, just nothing else there. Best sip was the last, the sediments did give a sweet taste.
M: As underwhelming as the smell and taste. Chewy, but a lingering foam. Foam like toothpaste with peroxide in it. It just doesn't go away. Has an alcohol burn going down. Definitely not pleasant.
D: I was very excited to try this beer, and left extremely disappointed. Maybe I need to try another bottle sometime. I don't know. Maybe I'm missing something here. But if I wanted Mickey's, I'd buy Mickey's for less than this one bottle. I would not recommend. I wanted to like it, just wasn't possible. 1,107 charactersajzbedo73, Feb 01, 2014

4.9/5  rDev +9.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Poured from their famous 11.2 oz bottle into chalice
A- Very dark, surprisingly so. Not quite black, almost more midnight purple if such a color exists. The initial appearance just seemed a little rough around the edges, and although it certainly has no off putting qualities, it just didn't have that insatiable look of irresistibility that some porters and stouts have. I suppose it is to style however.
S- This is when it gets good. I think I sat there and smelled this beer for 5 minutes before I dared to take a sip. Incredibly complex, one scent hurdling over another fighting it's way into your olfactory. Raisins, caramelized fig, dark overly ripe plum, molasses, each scent making a statement. Really, it's worth buying this beer just to smell it
T- Once again, incredible. Everything that you smell you taste, and maybe a little bit extra molasses, dark brown sugar as it finishes. Complexity just begins to describe it.
Mouthfeel- Slick in a pleasant way, nicely carbonated and rounded out, not a lot of burn especially for the ABV, each sip begs for another, you kind of feel cheated .8 oz by the end of it.
O- So glad I started paying ludacris amounts of money for beer I never considered purchasing a few years ago. It's hard to believe you can make such humble ingredients into an elixir like this. Unforgettable. 1,334 charactersGCBrewery, Feb 01, 2014

Smells of various fruits, mainly banana. A little booze is on the nose. Also somehow getting a scent similar to sprite...I don't know how or why, but it's definitely different.
Taste is so complex I'm having problems describing it. So many flavors going on, but it's all perfectly balanced. I don't know how they do it. I love this beer.
Mouth is thick and rich but somehow light at the same time. Again perfect balance.
Overall I wish I had more of this beer. Bought two, one to drink and one to age. Cannot wait to try this in about 3 years. This is a winner. Anyone who likes Belgians needs to try this! 734 charactersPeterParker, Jan 31, 2014

A thin veil of off-white head develops, lingers briefly, and then dissipates to a patchy collection of bubbles across the surface of the glass. Minimal lacing. The aroma is of candied brown sugar, plum, date, raisin, some toffee, more ubiquitous dark fruits, and caramel. A distinct belgian yeast aroma is also present alongside subtle clove. The taste begins with a bit of the brown sugar before a rush of fruit comes through - dark, raisin, plum, date, and even some grape. A nice yeasty funk and some straw finishes it off. Mouthfeel is full bodied but not too viscous, thanks to adequate carbonation. It is lively, and finishes dry with some of the fruity flavors lingering on the palate. Overall, this is a phenomenal belgian quadruple that is absolutely worthy of praise and attention. Well balanced, full of flavor, and simply an excellent brew. 947 characterseclipse54, Jan 25, 2014

A: pretty damn opaque and dark - reddish-brown? can't tell... huge head on the pour into a balloon glass, open-sponge structure, tan-hued, crackly.... fair bit of yeast made it into the glass
S: bright, clean, flowery alcohol aromatics - also spicy in a ginger and nutmeg-sort of way.... sort of a faint brown sugar undertone.... really no rich, deep aromas that penetrate the sinuses - just this dead, flat, unappealing moldy citrus peel thing going on
T: is this another damn infected bottle?! just had this happen with the 8... this is awful - super phenolic-spicy and tart and sickly acidic.... obfuscating any and all malt character... burnt, ashy campfire twigs...
M: drying, desiccating, thin and lifeless
O: I'm really gonna have a hard time recommending this beer to customers until I get a decent bottle again... kinda sucks at this price point... what the hell is going on here?! I know it's not supposed to taste like this... 971 charactersBouleboubier, Jan 24, 2014

Smell: Grape and fruit and spice.
Taste: Grape, Pepper, spice. Nice, warming alcohol.
This is incredible. I had forgotten how excellent it really is. The look is so fresh, and it's very neat to see a best-used-by date of January 2018. Often, at least in my opinion, beers that cross the 10% ABV line lose a lot of the beer quality for sheer alcoholic punch; basically, an unusual wine taste. This is one of the exceptions. The smell and taste have a sweet and spicy theme. The first smell is grape, and then followed by pepper and spice. I believe the taste does the same, but the pepper is the dominant note. This brew is hard to beat. OF course I will get this again. 797 charactersTeamMathis, Jan 21, 2014

4.41/5  rDev -1.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5The biggest and darkest of the Rochefort clan, poured into a goblet from the iconic bottle. Color is dark brown, with a decent amount of tan foam but less aggressive carbonation than the 6 and 8, not to mention other Trappist beers. Body is thicker than other Trappists but still falls short of imperial stout or barleywine values. Aroma is rather impressive, milk chocolate, rum, raisins, brown spices, and a blast of alcohol. Smells like a chocolate brownie drizzled with rum sauce. Tastes strong and boozy but quite sweet as well. Brown rye bread and cacao powder, dried dark fruit like dates or figs, caramelized bananas, burnt dark sugar and molasses, ample clove and ginseng spice, culinary herbs ... Wickedly complex and infused with aromatic alcohols. One of the more boozy beers I've had but this works with the other elements. Finishes earthy, woody, and a little tannic like overly steeped tea. Surprisingly complex but I'd say the spicy, earthy elements trump the sweet components in the overall impression. My favorite Trappist ale and widely regarded as one of the world's best beers. The fact that it is easy to find, to the point where some fools derogate it as a "shelf turd", just means that there is no excuse not to try it. 1,243 charactersCalgaryFMC, Jan 18, 2014

4.56/5  rDev +2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A dark mahogany colored liquid with slightly rosy edges and a major stack of light tan colored foam on top. Chunky lacing follows. The nose enjoys spiced yeast that hints at delicate cinnamon allspice and spruce vinegar. Smooth and so tasteful. The flavor ushers in a remarkably smooth creation that is such a beautiful blend that it's really difficult to identify any individual flavors. There's a light molasses/brown sugar and spruce/ juniper idea with a bit of Chardonnay and a touch of nutty maple whiskey. This probably isn't doing this fine world class beer any justice at all but it's a unique and wonderful blend. Carbonation in this solidly medium bodied brew is quite mild yet so proliferated as to convey a fairly lively, yet generally velvety feel. Quite a treat and definitely more refined than the "8" which I had last week. Ultimately these aren't my favorite flavors, but if they were, it could be a "5"! 921 charactersDurge, Jan 06, 2014

This isn't to criticize the beer, just something I don't recall. It's color is a murky brown, like the muddiest of waters, with a beautiful head on top that is both frothy and foamy. The head on this will persist longer than a good frolic in the sack with your gal pal. 
On the nose, I immediately get dark fruit, prunes and plums, but also a thick, creamy caramel aroma. There's a grainy quality and a hint of stiff spice that I enjoy. 
This brew almost borders on dessert. Sweet flavors of dark fruit and caramel, a tad of port-like booze, I feel like this beverage could easily be mistaken for something other than beer. It's burly, robust, slightly astringent, and offers flavors that skew more towards the wine world. 
But it's impressively creamy. That is, I think, the standout trait here. This beer has a feel that's close to milk. It's sweet, it's a bit boozy, but it's very mellow and creamy. 
Yeah, this beer is great. Particularly as it warms, I find it more and more enjoyable. 1,134 charactersONovoMexicano, Jan 05, 2014

A: Pours with great amounts of carbonation that I wasn't quite expecting. The fluffy white head disappears slowly into a nice cap with little to no lacing.
S: This is THE example of what a quad should be. Slight light sweetness of raisins and breads. Little to no detectable alcohol. For all of the american imitators, you have a long way to go. 
T: Just a wonderful balance of malty, bread, nutty, with a hint of chocolate. Nothing jumps up at you, but everything in perfect balance. 
M: The copious amounts of carbonation and malts give this beer a creamy, long finish that just keeps developing. NIce.

Smells of soft darker malt, some metallic notes...not a lot of smell, I'm surprised. I'll let it warm more and see how it develops. 
Taste is incredibly well-balanced...soft malt, dark sweet bread, dark fruit, toffee, caramel, cherries, golden raisins...no booze at all, which is incredibly for 11+%. 
Mouthfeel is well-carbonated, fluffy and relatively light for the weight of the brew. 
Overall, outstanding stuff. I was half-expecting my mind to be blown, but then I remembered that the trappist brews don't aim for mind-blowing...they aim for perfect, balanced harmony. And that is exactly what this beer achieves. 763 charactersBurgeoningBrewhead, Jan 01, 2014

The nose presents raisin, toffee with a degree of mustiness. 
Plum, fig and spice dominate the taste but malt, faint raspberry and earthiness are present here as well. Aftertaste is slightly tart.
Mouthfeel is clean with good carbonation and excellent head retention and lacing. 
A very complex beer. Delicious! 396 charactersBeerGod27, Dec 26, 2013

4.53/5  rDev +1.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.511 month old bottle. Dark brown/mahogany, darker than say, Rochefort 8. Nice head formation and retention, eventually receding to a foamy film. Some streaks of lace. Big aromas of dark fruit, sugary-ness invoking freshly-baked dark desserts, and musty yeast + liquor (dark rum) in the background. Quite sweet smelling.
Sweetness from candi sugar upfront becomes more restrained shortly thereafter. Lots of fruit notes both light and dark brought about by the yeast: pears, plums, figs. Fuel note reminds you that this is a big beer, but this is still very drinkable (for the style) simply because it's so damn good. Carbonation is very well-mannered for a bottle-conditioned beer, so soft and smooth without coming across as flat.
Lighter, sweeter, not quite as complex and balanced as Westy 12. Still, Rochefort 10 is quite a worthy substitute and belongs among the elite dark Belgian ales. 893 charactersgr0g, Dec 25, 2013

Appearance: A brown sort of color with a decent haze to it. Quite a bit of sediment. A little head. Basically no lacing. 
Smell: Plum/raisin is definitely the most significant aroma. Quite sweet. A lot of caramel malts. 
Taste/feel: Pretty much heaven. The 11.3% is invisible in the taste/aroma, but you get the warmth. You know it’s there. Just a wallop of dark fruits and some caramel malts... a pure joy to drink. A nice feel with a solid carbonation. When Rochefort 10 feels like it’s getting a bit too sweet, the carbonation bubbles it away. Never syrupy thick or cloying in anyway. 
A delight to drink. I feel like I may prefer St. Bernardus 12 to this by a slight margin, but this is still a World Class Quad without a doubt. 875 charactersSerialTicker, Dec 21, 2013

An appetizing yet moderate aroma of dried dark fruits, toasted malts , earth, and sour dough masked all traces of hops aroma. Robust smell of booze and yeast.
Moderately sweet boozy start with distinct notes of tawny port, rum and raisin dark chocolate. Long, sweet alcohol fueled finish with a punch of malt sweetness that went up and out the nose.
Full bodied on the palate with soft non distracting carbonation (I drank this over five hours so it was flat towards the end) and a syupy texture that is a result of the alcoholic finish.
I found the carbonation level of this beer and the complex delivery of the alcohol taste to be the defining assets that sets it apart from other quads. 847 charactersBILF, Dec 13, 2013

A: pours a nutty brown color with a lot of sediment throughout (perhaps I should've left more in the bottle but I'm not complaining). Has just over 1 finger of dense beige head, which retains a nice medium lacing. As it effervesces with the sediment in the glass it reminds me of a freshly fermenting carboy. 
S: I wish I were getting more out of this, but I tend to believe it isn't a big seller around here and may have lost something. I get notes of dark fruit, plum, grape, sweetness, alcohol, and malt character
T: wow, it starts off with a big malty backbone and follows through with quite sweet plum, raisin, and rich wine-like dark fruits, a hint of chocolate, slight bitterness and finishes with noticeable alcohol and warmth. Very sweet but not cloying. 
M: smooth, full body, and dense richness, travels well across the palate and maintains the warmth of the 11% ABV. Has an almost spritey finish which lingers. Clean. 
O: I am very pleased by this beer. It reminds me of drinking a fine, sweet red wine with all the appeal of a beer. It is a great winter drink as there is a noticeable (but very smooth) alcohol presence and it warms after each swallow a bit like brandy. This was recommended to me by the shop owner, and I am very glad to have tried it. I'm not yet familiar with quads, but look forward to trying more after this. I'd love to know what a fresher one is like, but would still suggest it gladly. 1,600 charactersCrafts_and_recreation, Dec 10, 2013

A - Poured brownish purple in color, like the color of prune juice. Single finger of off-white head which mostly fades. Leaves a ring of light foam on sides of glass and a thin foam which covers only part of the beer's surface. Leaves small bubbles on sides of glass when liquid recedes. Any lacing left on sides of glass slowly slides down glass and rejoins beer. Cloudy, looks like material is suspended in liquid, but can't feel that in texture. First pour yielded no sediment. Second pour yielded heavy sediment, purple flakes which mainly remained suspended in liquid and some brown sludge which matriculated to the bottom of the glass. I prefer no sediment, and usually downgrade appearance when this occurs, but had to give some points back on how good it looked on first pour. Had I known better, I could have avoided the majority of the sludge on the 2nd pour.
S - Peach, plum, raison, and pear. Slightly boozy, somewhat like a desert wine.
T - Raisin first and foremost, with some plum. Bitter raisin/prune finish. Dry, light bodied, with low sweetness. ABV not completely hidden, but flavor and mouthfeel deliver higher ABV rather well. Lasting bitterness on tongue.
M - Higher carbonation, but complements taste rather well. Carbonation lasting; does not quickly dissipate from beer. Very crisp.
O - 2nd quad tried and definitely worth a try. Look forward to exploring more of this style. 1,526 charactersDuane_Opfer, Dec 01, 2013

A. Dark brown to almost black appearance with a big, puffy light tan head of 2 fingers. 
S. Funky belgian yeast - gives off a cheese / yogurt type aroma with some barnyard thrown in for good measure. Some fruitiness emerges as it warms. Very intriguing. 
T. Funky flavors of yogurt, cheesy malt and some alcoholic warmth. Black cherry and a touch of bitterness on the finish. Like the nose - quite intriguing. 
M. Silky and creamy with a smooth mouthfeel. 
O. A nice follow up to Rochefort 8. I am not sure which I prefer - both are very good but if forced to choose I'd go with 8. This is a nice change of pace beer but not one that I need to have more than a few times per year. 710 charactersbound4er, Nov 28, 2013
4.9/5  rDev +9.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75From the bottle on 11/25/2013. I didn't let it age on my own, but I suspect it had been sitting on the self for some time due to the store not having a ton of craft beer patrons. I don't know if that is the wrong orright way to do it, but consider it what you will.
Appearance: Quite a bit more head formed than I expected. I poured it into a wine glass; I figured that wa the closest thing I had to the proper glassware. Initially there was a two fingered head with a fluffy foam topping. Once the head calmed down it left an intermittent lacing along the sides of the glass. Color was a very dark maroonsih-brown. Surprisingly dark for a quad is the reason for the lower score for appearance. 
Smell: I have never smelled something like this in a beer before. The primary aroma was exactly like a dry red wine. I had to take a double smell to confiem the first. Yup, that smells almost exactly like wine. This made me doubt at first because I thought the taste would follow the smell. Also, there were notes of figs and brown sugar in the smell, hardly noticeable due to the wine scent.
Taste: There is a lot going on with this beer. Initial thoughts focus on the sweetness. What I notice most on the main taste is the belgium sugar candies / brown sugar that stand out. Also, the rich malty hug that embraces your palate is quite strong. Then the aftertaste hits and I am completely lost. So many flavors going on that I have to take sip after sip and wait to try and recognize what I am tasting. I noticed hints of grapes and figs, but I am sure those monks added a bunch of other ingrediants that I will probably never guess.
Mouthfeel: There was a warming alcohol feel at the finsih of each drink. However, it wasn't biting or bothersome in any way, and I didn't notiice it until I was really paying attention and got the brew to explore the back of my mouth. Medium caronation added what it needed. Pretty darn smooth as well. Felt pleasent and easy on the tongue.
Overall: Trappist beers are quite a road to explore. This is my first, and I plan to try them all. I was thoroughly impressed and couldn't have asked for a better introduction to the Trappist brews. I will definately suggest to my friends. A great beer for the craft brew geek, but maybe a bit much for someone not as involved in the lifestyle.

3/5  rDev -32.9%look: 3 | smell: 3 | taste: 3 | feel: 3 |  overall: 3Pours a surprisingly DARK hazy brown. I mean DARK. I didn't know a quad could look like this. Smell is typical yeasty smell of Belgian beers with a maltier tone.
The TASTE was a punch in the face. I was not expecting this. It was a punch in the face of dark, rotting fruits. ALL of them! It was a punch in the face of yeast. It had a MUCH maltier backbone than I was expecting. This stuff is like Belgian beer extract. The only thing it WASN'T a punch in the face of, sadly, was alcohol. The bite is a lot less subdued than in most quads I've tried. Well hidden under layer upon layer of dark, fruity flavours and thick essence of malted barley. I like flavourful beers, but this is maybe too much for me. It's so sweet, and with such, a full body, and so much yeast. I mean, this is an interesting experience, but for the price tag, I definitely can't go back for this again. It may be considered an ancient standard of the style, but this is crazy with the flavours. Under some rotting apricot flavour, I just got a whiff of some coriander, cinnamon and maybe anise. To add to my overwhelming experience. I'm not sure what to do about this insane concoction. I know it's a classic, but it's so intense that it's hard to get through my 11 ounces, even. If you want something that took more ingredients in one bottle than American beers put in a keg, try this out. It will blow your mind. 
What really put me over the edge, though, was too much of a brown sugar/molasses type flavour. I like sweet beers, but that brown sugary flavour is just cloying. 1,552 charactersElCommodoro, Nov 25, 2013

I think the smell is nice with that Belgian barnyard. Again I think this is a beer that should be consumed after sitting on it a couple of years. It is a waste of a beer if you open it fresh. Almost like a wine it is to young and tight fresh. I would by this beer if it was a everyday beer you can get at the store but I do not see my self ever trying to find it. 430 charactersvinny21bal, Nov 17, 2013

Got the 6 and the 10 in my latest trip to Whole Foods, and tried both back-to-back, 6 first. Both are very smooth and drinkable. Both to me are malty in nature... there is just not much bitter hops pull in either. The 6 (Dubbel) has a little more bitterness, but that's to be expected as higher alcohol beers can tend towards more sweetness.
This beer pours dark amber-brown, and has more head than one might expect from a higher-octane offering. It also has a wine-raisin nose, pretty prevalent. As I take tastes, the nose stays prevalent, but the tongue get a bunch of fig versus the described nose. The alcohol is almost unnoticeable, as is any bitterness from the hops. The lingering taste remains sweet to me, I get toffee near the end at the back of the tongue.
I can see why this is rated so highly, very refined; counter that with not ranging the spectrum of tastes (pretty much stays on the sweeter side), but not lacking a certain complexity within the side of the spectrum it is on. 1,092 characterscjgiant, Nov 16, 2013

4.46/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Served in a tulip glass. 
Appearance: Pours a beautiful hazy brown with ridiculous bubbles on the body with a slight off-white head rising thick at first (just a notch over a finger's length) settling with perfect even lacing. 
Smell: Has a slight hit of fruit and wine, real easy on the nostrils but very addicting...one sniff isn't enough. 
Taste: A complex fruit infusion with a mellow tone of yeast. Comes off just notch sweet, almost grape like with a touch of brown sugar. It still does have a sight bitterness to it but not heavy in hops but more like a grapefruit mixture to go with it, absolutely well done. 
Mouth: Very sticky, medium carbonation but super full bodied and the way it should be. You put this glass down and all you can think is how delish this brew is. 
Overall: As many times as I've seen this on the shelf, big regret not picking it up any sooner...it is almost the total package but honestly for the eight bucks or so the bottle goes for it is worth every f'n penny. Salud! 1,007 charactersBlurryVisi0n, Nov 15, 2013

The aroma is rich: very sweet malt, figs, dates, candi sugar, grain husk, and brandy wine. Taste is of those elements, with an overriding fruitcake note and a significant alcohol backing. Bitterness is low but present. Mouthfeel is heavy, cloying, brandy-like, and highly prickly. Rochefort Trappistes 10 finishes sweet, dry, rich, and boozy. Overall, this is a wonderful, world-class beer!

Pours a big fizzy bubbly 1+ finger head into my goblet, fades pretty quickly though, lots of big bubbles popping, very little lacing left, super dark cocoa brown color with very little light sneaking through the thin parts, and plenty of chunkies on the bottom.
Nose is much more complex than I expected (even though I've had this before but it's been a long time), a nice caramelized brown sugar like with some candi sugar, very soft malt complexity, a nice soft brown malt like with the sweet characters, little toffee and caramel, but a really nice soft aged old ale malt like character. Then dark fruits, light raisin and fig, and a bit of candied plums, and a little creaminess with that. The toffee increases a bit and gets a little almost buttery biscuit like, with a touch of alcohol and phenols, there's a nice toasty brown malt in there, with toasted caramelized candi sugar all around.
Taste starts a ton complex too, lots of great malts, sweet characters, fruits, etc, all combined very nicely. I'll start with the malts for lack of any specific place, dark brown malts, little bit of a toasty brown malt, and a really nice soft aged malt like an old ale, with a little creamy character as well, and into some buttery biscuit, that quickly turns into the sweet characters, lots of toffee, some nice sugars too with a caramelized candi sugar, a pretty big candi sugar kick without too syrupy or even sweet, and a little molasses. Then into booze, a decent booze warmth and tingle but not quite 11.3% feel, bringing a bit of phenols as well, I can feel the booze warming the throat mostly. Fruits as there too, a little candied plum again, mild raisin and fig again as well, typical dark fruits. All that nice complexity somehow blended very well to a nice soft creamy delicious beer. Finish brings more warming booze, little tingle and warming the throat, a little sticky sweetness but surprisingly not so syrupy or sweet, little dry even, more candied dark fruits, lots more candi sugar, toasted brown malts and creamy dark malts.
Mouth is med to fuller bod, some warming tingly booze, and lots of carbonation, a bit too much on the carbonation.
Overall great! Pretty much a staple for Belgian quad style beer, and at the top of the top of beers in the world altogether, especially ones that I can regularly get. Perhaps the only real flaw is the over carbonation, that's probably due to extra fermenting in the bottle which added a bit of booze and phenols, but softened the beer a lot, plus the yeast chunkies. All around and amazing beer with great characters and great blending of all characters, smooth, rich, delicious! 2,665 charactersjlindros, Nov 12, 2013

I'll start out by saying this is a very good Quad. Maybe it would have scored higher for us had we not had it versus the Westy 12. It just did not hold a candle to the Westy, unfortunately, though it's lower price and much better availability makes this a good choice.
The Rochefort 10 is a cloudy amber color. The smell is dominated by caramel and it has a caramel, sweet finish with a hint of banana. Maybe some aging would tone this one down and score it higher for me. Very good, but can't drink a lot of it, being this sweet. At 11.3% ABV, you'd expect it to be more boozy than it is. The alcohol is hidden well with only a slight warmth in your belly giving it away.
I will have to try this one again, after a year in my cellar. 823 charactersEmpiricalBill, Nov 10, 2013

The taste is a bit boozy at first (which would be expected with such a high BAC). But wow. The aftertaste saves it. The boozy flavor doesn't last long before it gets replaced by a sweet creamy flavor that crawls up from the back of your throat. The flavor is full bodied and it's a realitively slow drinker. I enjoyed it a lot. I'm not sure that I'd give it a 100, but it's definitely a beer that any craft beer enthusiast should try in their lifetime. Good stuff. 559 charactersRyan_Graham, Nov 08, 2013

Smell is of fig and caramel up front with faint banana and burnt wood toward the finish.
Taste is dominated by dark fruit: Figs, plums and dates, followed by faint banana and a hint of molasses sweetness. ABV is completely undetectable.
Creamy yet, medium bodied with medium carbonation. Extremely easy to drink despite the 11.3% ABV.
This one certainly lives up to the hype. Beautiful appearance, inviting aroma, subtle yet, delicious flavors and silky smooth mouthfeel. Unfortunately, economics will prevent regular consumption on my part. Truly impressive and certainly a world class brew. 726 charactersFurlinator, Nov 08, 2013

I have nothing fancy to say, no clever words, no witty observations...just try this beer. Go buy some now. Leave your kids home alone, for there is no time to call a baby-sitter. Don't wait for your spouse, just go...leave before they even get out of the shower...GO!
This beer changed the way I look at beers. I should really hate this beer, in all honesty, as it ruined many other beers for me. I had three of my favorite beers to follow this one with as they were all darker. Palo Santo Marron....meh. Founders Curmudgeon...rubbish. Old Rasputin...I've seen similar shades of brown on the "Stool Color Chart" at the Doctor's office.
I would gladly leave my beloved wife, and shave my head into a silly Tonsure to be able to craft this beer. 873 charactersSvendozen, Nov 04, 2013

A: Dark brown with large off-white bubbles. Half finger head receded to a quarter finger and lingered. Excellent head retention, with some barista-like swirls covering the top. A bit of sediment at the bottom of the bottle.
S: Caramel, plum and dates, a bit of toffee.
T: Sweet dark fruits, plum is dominant fruit flavor, accompanied by dates. Toffee/caramel kicks in towards the end and is carried away by a warm, ever so slightly alcoholic finish. Sweet malts and plum linger. As the beer warmed up, caramel notes became dominant. Gets better throughout the beer - was sad to see the last sip go.
M: Very creamy, medium carbonation, lightly coats the mouth. Very nice.
O: Delicious brew, the 11% ABV is hidden effortlessly. Looked beautiful in the glass, and tasted great to boot. Paired really well with some sharp cheddar cheese. 872 charactersbareju, Nov 01, 2013

A - Rich creamy leathery pour with a small off white to tan head. Leaves solid lacing on the glass.
S - Not a huge can of the smell of belgian style beers but this one changed my mind a little. figs, almost coriander smell, hidden fruits plums maybe and possibly tobacco
T - Figs, plums, pear and various other fruits with a minimal taste of booze. Its masked well considering the 11.3% abv
M - Creamy goodness, good medium body mouthfeel.
O - Starting to change my mind about some belgian beers. Im not a huge fan of the distinct taste that most belgian ales have but this is definitely a world class Belgium ale 
A little pricey on 7 bucks per 11.2 ounce bottle but I will grab this every once in a while. 750 charactersdrmcleod10, Oct 29, 2013

Smell: Toffee and deep/rich fruits like plum.
Taste: Some caramel and toffee, but to me tastes mostly the general quad flavor of rich fruits. Alcohol comes through warm, but you can't tell this is 11+ percent; alcohol warms very nicely and is very pleasant.
Mouthfeel: Medium body with perfect carbonation.
Overall: Great beer with rich flavors; awesome quad and one I'll be having again. 593 characterscr0ckett, Oct 16, 2013

The smell of this one reminds me a bit of candy, mainly toffee and caramel. Bit of brown sugar and cookie dough as well.
Sweet and fruity, lot of dried fruit like raisin and fig going on. There is brown sugar and toffee, and that distinctive Belgian candy sugar flavor. 
Full and smooth, nothing to complain about here.
I am reviewing this right after trying their 8, and while similar, there are differences. Both are nice and complex, but I notice the alcohol warming on the 8 more. This is a big beer, one you need to savor slowly. Definitely one of the best quads I have had, I can see why this beer is rated as world class. 782 charactersVixie, Oct 14, 2013

4.63/5  rDev +3.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5A - Rochefort 10 is a deep,leathery brown with rusty highlihgts. Head is packed, tan colored and lasting. As it recedes, Belgian lace clings to the side of my glass.
S - Rochefort 10's aroma gives up front notes of leather, ripe figs, and dampe earth on an autumn day. Then comes the aroma of dried fruit and spices. Maybe Christmas cake spices? Notes of damp earth and dried tobacco provide a nice through note.
T - Rochefort 10 is medium full bodied and full of flavor. Dried ripe fruits combine with tobacco, ripe figs, and a gentle spiciness. On the tongue spiciness has a more cloves, rum and raisin quality than the nose led me to expect. Rochefort 10 is dry and crisp without overly accentuating the beer's spicy qualities. Finish is only slightly alcoholic and offers a pleasant warmth.
O - This is one of the best beers I've had to date. It's just so complex and well balanced. It's big in every way without losing its refinement. Rochefort 10 even manages to carry its 11.3% abv with incredible deftness and grace. 1,027 charactersBrianhophead, Oct 13, 2013

4.96/5  rDev +11%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5I have to say this is one of the best beers I have ever had. This is truly the champaign of beers. The sweet fruit notes, small bubbles, and acidic taste mirror that of a fine champaign, only with the distinct Belgian Trappist flavor. The complexity of this beer is outstanding and makes it a beer to savor. I can't wait to have another one.
I used a glad designed for Trappist beer and ended up with almost no head which surprised me. There was also more sediment than I have had in other Trappists beers, but that didn't effect the flavor. Otherwise this beer is as perfect as it gets. 588 charactersMikey256, Oct 06, 2013

Pours dark brown with a finger of beige head and some lacing.
Malt forward nose with lots of vanilla, light phenolic character, dark fruit sweetness, wafts of alcohol.
More of that vanilla malt character dark fruit undertone. Beautifully constructed malt profile. Delicious.
This beer has a big body for big ABV. Soft, nearly velvety, not too heavy.
World class beer that's highly accessible. It doesn't get much better than that. 511 charactersTheMultiYeast, Sep 29, 2013

Be selfish with this one, my friends and enjoy one of the best beers that has ever crossed my lips. 547 charactersAustinkitten, Sep 23, 2013

Pours a mahogany brown with some sediment and huge tan head that fades very slowly. Smell is plum, raison, fig, brandy and a little vanilla. Taste is like the nose with the dark fruits up front and touch of booze. Mouthfeel is lighter than you would expect considering the ABV. Very smooth.

Pours very dark brown with a thick 2-3 finger khaki head that sits for quite awhile. Lots of dark fruits in the nose. Bit of caramel and wheat bread. Hint of alcohol finishes out the aroma. 
The taste is filled with figs, blackberries, creamy caramel, and the slightest hint of vanillia bean. Nice bready malts as well. You get some of the alcohol showing up in the taste as well. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a abundance of carbonation. The carbonation is a bit much. The alcohol is also noticeable in the feel. 
This thing is a massive beer, from start to finish its a knockout punch. Its expensive but worth it if you want to stash a few bottles away for special occasions. I've heard it gets better with age and will experiment accordingly. 790 charactersscreamking, Sep 12, 2013

4.51/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Ah, the mighty prestigious Rochefort 10... in my snifter... at cellar temperature.
A two-finger, pale-tan head which dissipates quickly. The color is the deepest, darkest, haziest ruby color it could be. Nice.
Smells like vanilla, brandy, and raisins. Maybe some maple syrup too. It's a REALLY nice scent.
The aroma describes the taste to a great extent, but with even more of the dark fruits. It has a fruity richness (...or rich fruitiness?) reminiscent of red wine, but more earthy. Tastes boozy. And of raisins and prunes.
The feel is viscous but spritzy. Feels like a HEFTY Belgian ale, which it is.
I don't know if it's good enough to warrant ten dollars for just under 12 ounces (By Bacchus! that's expensive!), but putting the price aside... It's a really good Belgian ale. 786 charactersKuaff, Sep 07, 2013

Appearance: Pours a murky red brown color with a finger of a light tan head. Minimal head retention and lacing. Body is nearly opaque with only small amounts of light getting through around the edges of the glass.
Smell: Dark fruits, raisin and fig, hint of caramel, some bready malt.
Taste: Follows the nose. Dark fruits, candi sugar, bready malt, hints of spice.
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied. Carbonation bordering on high. Slight alcohol warmth in the finish, but overall the booze is hidden well.
Overall: Really good beer, but for whatever reason this just doesn't do it for me like some of it's other Belgian counterparts. Still worth a try if you've never had it though. 701 charactersJonada, Sep 01, 2013

Ap- pours a dark brown color with a nice off white/tan head that has good retention. Beer is opaque but not hazy. 
Ar- lots of malt, plums, some spice, cocoa, and some alcohol
T- tons of sweet malt, dark fruit, very smooth, and some alcohol on the finish, but not as much as you would expect at 11.3%. The finish and the aftertaste is simply amazing
M- well carbonated, slighty sticky, medium bodied, alcohol warms nicely on the hold
O- a truly amazing quad, my brother bought this for me to enjoy and I am glad he did. One of the best quads I have had...its a toss up between this and the St. Bernardus 12, cheers! 650 charactersBeerNutz324, Aug 24, 2013

Pours a deep, mahogany brown. Almost opaque. Very impressive head, 2 fingers or so.
Smells like candi sugar, raisins, and brown sugar. Awesome!
Tastes incredible. The aforementioned smells are present, plus more dark fruit, rum, caramel, tobacco, slight smokiness. Very sweet but not cloying. A more sophisticated sort of sweetness.
Full, chewy mouthfeel. Leaves you wanting sip after sip.
The best Belgian beer I've ever had. Oh yes. 545 charactersGreesyFizeek, Aug 24, 2013

A: Dark caramel with explosive head, 3 fingers worth and took 3 careful pours. Lingered for a while at one finger until it settled to a wispy covering leaving sticky lace behind on the glass.
S: Wine like with tannen like and strong fruits of prune plumb apricot at least. Lingered until he end.
T: Strong and rich, wine like with the aforementioned fruits plus some caramel. The alcohol comes through late. No bitterness standing out.
M: Ultra malty, heavy and rich. Carbonation explodes again if you can wait a couple seconds. You have to swallow before it runs out of gas.
O: Perhaps the perfect beer, it has everything and lots of it except bitterness but who cares? A sipping beer with a meal and it will still knock you over. I'll spring for another one of these days, nothing else comes close. 835 charactersfizzgig, Aug 24, 2013

4.38/5  rDev -2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.25A - The dark color is rather interesting. Almost what I would expect of a chocolate root beer concoction - Dark brown mixed with hints of crimson and magenta. It poured rather smoothly, and the head quickly dissipated. 
S - There is a red wine-like smell to the brew. I didn't really expect that, not knowing much about this beer. I don't think it has a particularly strong smell otherwise. But I find it enjoyable. 
T - Very complex and very balanced. The spice is balanced by the sweetness - it's what I would imagine melange would be like. There's a boozy taste mixed in, but it's not strong enough to be detracting. 
M - There's a high amount of carbonation. Certainly not sessionable and not a lawnmowerish brew (although at 11 percent, that's obvious). It's full bodied, bringing a pleasant feel. 
Overall ... I enjoyed this beer - no shock there. At first I thought the booze was a little strong, but I came to like it as the beer warmed up as I was drinking it. I had it in a bottle, pouring into a chalice. The label says 260116 - which would make me believe it should be enjoyed no later than January 26, 2016. If my understanding is correct, then this beer was bottled in 2011. 1,192 charactershmich176, Aug 21, 2013

Beautiful: deep ruby/root-beer hybrid color, khaki head that sticks splotchy all over the glass. 
First whiff while still cold reminds me of a dr. pepper almost... tons of ripe fruit, nuts, liquors... at first it's overwhelming, in an awesome way. Letting it get back to a room temp gets back to familiar territory: dried dark fruits, cabernet/wine, tons of amaretto....there's something 'buttery' about the anticipation of this beverage. 
While there's a touch of nuttiness on the nose, the first sips relinquish massive walnut notes and a shocking amount of vanilla for something that never saw oak. From here on out there's, again, too much to really try to list: dark fruits (plum, fig, cherry, etc), definite porto notes, amaretto...If it is RICH, you're likely to find it here.
Feel is buttery, has lively carbonation, and lingers forever. I've had plenty of domestic quads and they just don't hold a candle to this. While the alcohol doesn't register at all, it's not an exceeding sweetness that distracts like some. The syncornicty of the dryness, fruit flavors, and carbonation as they slid off the palate is truly the essence of this beer.
If you've never had this, you need to know what this tastes like. Liquid beauty/perfection. 1,312 charactersPrince_Casual, Aug 17, 2013

Pours a murky red hued soft but dark russet with a thin half finger cap of sand colored head. No lace to speak of. 
Aromas of plums, port, red wine, caramel, raisins, brown sugar and cherry. A sweet, vinous, inviting nose. 
Such rich complexity in the taste. An abundance of stone fruit followed by and mingling with red wine, port, brown sugar, toffee, caramel, raisin bread and a good bit of booze. Slightly hot and quite sweet. Opens up beautifully as it warms. 
Smooth medium body. Slightly thinner than expected with pretty heavy carbonation.
An outstanding quad. Not sure why I don't get this more often. Mandatory for any fan of quads. 788 charactersThickNStout, Aug 16, 2013

A: Dark Sappy Amber, 3-4 Fingers of Head still settling. Nice amounts of bubbles, subtle carbonation. 1-2 finger head. 
S: Fruity, sweet like plums or cherries. 
T: Sweet. But really well done. Fruit, cherries, plums with a bit of Orange. Tastes Better than the Smell. Fairly week Alcohol taste, good kick of sweetness, not overpowering by either. 
M: Really Smooth. Comforting, a Good one to relax to after a long day. Not too Carbonated yet a small kick at the end.. (the ABV might hit later, not really feeling it now)
Good aftertaste. Still a small fruity with a cherry finish.

A: dark mahogany brown, many micro bubbles, great head retention, and beautiful lacing.
S: dark sugar, raisins, maybe some plum, molasses and a dark sweet biscuit
T: fairly sweet, molasses is prominent, along with the raisin and some sweet bread. A little cinnamon and plum on the end, some belgian yeast characteristics. Faint bubblegum and some fruity esters.
M: medium bodied. The bubbles coat the mouth. Floods the mouth quickly and leaves just as fast with a spicy note and very mild heat on the finish. Leaves the mouth fairly dry and sweet.
O: little too sweet for my liking. Some good notes but would love a little bitterness to balance the sweet. But that is the style. And there are no flaws to this beer. No off tastes, very smooth and would be a good sipper by the fire. 998 charactersjageraholic, Aug 12, 2013

Smell: Not a strong bouquet, but an interesting one. Bready malt with the usual notes of mocha and caramel are most noticeable, but not far off is a unique aroma of lemon custard. 
Taste: Complex, yet well-balanced. Ah, my favorite magical combo. True to style, the taste is similar to the nose, although the lemony sourness is replaced by bright apricots, dark plums, and spicy pepper. With the caramelized malt and just slightly chocolate flavors, this makes for a sweet, yet refined celebration of tastes. Some sips left me wanting less sugar, but this didn't detract from the undeniable expertise behind this beer. 
Mouthfeel: Its medium full quality is aided by the elegant head, which adds fine body to every sip. Medium high carbonation keeps things from getting too heavy. Alcohol warmth is apparent, but does not overwhelm, even at an 11% ABV. 
Overall: Truly lives up to the hype for this lover of strong dark Belgians. ;) Would be 100% exquisite if it were just a touch less sweet. Plenty to enjoy here--this beer is definitely a sipper, as there is so much to be relished, and yet, a second glass might put you over the edge! 1,325 charactersBethanyB, Aug 10, 2013

Smell is prune, date, raisin. 
Taste is ashy, not as complex, almost a bandaid flavor. 
Great mouthfeel but a bit of heat. Odd finish. 
As it warms, smell gets toffee/fruit/candy. Still has an odd finish, sharp and offensive up front. Ends up with a barleywine feel to it. 
This was the most like Westy, but I wouldn’t say either are the best Belgium beer, and I wouldn’t say it is close to the best beer I have had. 470 charactersSmurf2055, Aug 08, 2013

A: Pours a deep dark reddish-brown. Good sized fluffy and fizzy tan head. Head fizzes out fast, leaving zero lacing behind. Halfway decent retention at least.
S: Rich and sweet dark fruits. Wonderful dark fruit aroma in fact. Lots of raisin and fig of course, but notable cherries as well. Maybe prunes and plums? Candied fruits abound. No alcohol sting at all.
T: Sweet and decadent dark fruits again. Loaded with them as mentioned in the aroma. I swear I even get grape in addition to what I've previously mentioned. Sweet bready malt. Kinda reminds me of poundcake. No real noticeable alcohol, maybe the slightest hint of booze on the back end. Spices in the finish, mild and well integrated. 
M: Fairly heavy but not cloying. Not too viscous. Just about right really.
O: A wonderful quad, one of the best. Destroys St. Bernardus Abt 12 out of the water and gives Westy 12 a run for its money. Super sweet and fruity, one of the fruitiest (in a good way) quads I've ever had. Ages well too apparently, flavors meld nicely and it goes down so easily. Great beer. 1,248 charactersDope, Aug 06, 2013

Look is deep dark brown with a tan head and sticky lacing.  Smell is spice, plum, raisin, currant and ripe melon with sweet malt aromas.  Taste is spice, plum, raisin and currant with lots of sweet malt flavors.  Feel is full in body and a little prickly on the tongue. 339 charactersHopheadjeffery, Aug 04, 2013

A: Dark amber. Barely translucent. Poured a 2-finger head that slowly retreated to a frothy head. Thick lacing.
S: Moderately fragrant. Dark roasted malts and Belgian yeast. Slight booze at end.
T: Strong dark malts on front. Very slightly bitter. Grains. Not much of a hops presence. Booze at the end. Yeasty. A very slight sweetness in the form of cherries and plums.
M: Full bodied. High carbonation. Fairly smooth given ABV and amount of ingredients. 
O: Excellent. The OG quad. I'm not a huge fan of quads but I would enjoy this again and certainly recommend it to anyone. Given it's strong characteristics, I would not drink more than one during a session. 684 charactersmacher0, Jul 29, 2013

Received as a gift from my gal who purchased a three pack in Belgium consisting of the 6, 8 and 10. Taste wise, each was better than the last. I'd say the 8 was most drinkable, and the 10 best overall. This Quad is certainly one to indulge in, or at least try. 320 charactersdrherrma, Jul 24, 2013

A: Dark brown body with a beige 2-fingered head. It retains foam very well leaving a beautiful lace.
S: Yeasty smell with cherries, dark fruits. You can smell some spices.
T: Consistent with the smell, you can taste the cherries in it. It's almost perfect.
M: Creamy, carbonated, alcohol goes almost unnoticed (for a 11.3% ABV).
O: This is for sure the best beer I've ever had until today. I've had some Trappists before this one but this Trappistes Rochefort 10 sets the higher standard. 559 charactersjoaopmgoncalves, Jul 23, 2013
4.75/5  rDev +6.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.75Poured from the bottle into a tulip.
A: An unfiltered dark brown ale that almost looks red. The head pours thick and off white. Then retains very well, leaving little lacing on the glass.
S: Thick, dark fruits and cherry come through in what is a sour aroma with a bit of a spice kick. Every bit what a Belgian quad should smell like.
T: Very true to the aroma, this strong quad gives sweet dark fruits tones. Much like raisins. The booze is apparent, which is very much expected from this huge quad. 
M: Stingy from the carbonation and booze. Thick and dry. 
O: Had to close my eyes a few times while drinking this one. It practically set off fireworks in my brain. The very sweet malts balanced well with the incredible Belgian yeast. The booze helped me feel like I was enjoying the same brew that some Trappists were drinking a few centuries ago. 10/10 will drink again. 879 charactersxseanprimex, Jul 23, 2013

A- Pours a mostly opaque medium brown color with a ¼ inch head that retains a bit before soon becoming a thick ring around the edge of the glass and a big swirl of surface foam.
S- Soft aroma of caramel and toasted malt. Also a hint of spice and banana.
T- Flavor is much like the aroma with some toasted malt and sweetness. Very mild hop taste balances well against the sugars and alcohol. Speaking of alcohol, it's a tad hot and there's also some mild oxidation flavors of wet cardboard. Gets better as it warms
M- A bit stingy from the alcohol and syrupy. Medium-low carbonation and a full body.
O- One of the top contenders among quads but it doesn't quite drive it home as well as La Trappe or Pannepot IMO. 804 charactersImmortale25, Jul 21, 2013

330ml bottle poured into 1st use Flying Saucer snifter.
A - Dark chocolate brown with crimson overtones. It poured with a strong light brown head that went away quickly. Impressive pour. 
S - The smell of fruit comes through in every whiff. Also, subtle touches of cherry. I also sensed a good kick of spice, along with a rum-like alcohol burst. 
T - The power of this beer really shines in the taste. You can taste the fruit and the molasses hints in every taste. Also, the alcohol taste kicks in early, but the spicy flavor keeps it good throughout. The malt flavor is strong and sweet enough that it perfectly levels out the alcohol.
M - The carbonation makes this beer for me. For me, this is what makes this such a drinkable beer for one with such a high alcohol content. Even with the strong alcohol flavor in every sip, you are left with a great taste and aftertaste. 
O - An incredible beer... this is one that is deserving of all the good press. You can tell that time and effort have been put in every bottle. This is a beer that deserves time and respect. 1,147 charactersScottSwim, Jul 19, 2013

Aroma of caramel malt and dark fruit.  Plum, raisin, and anise.  Fresh baked dark bread,
Taste is rich, sweet malt.  Caramel, molasses, and toffee.  Belgian yeast and dark bread.  Some fruity flavors.  Ripe plum, raisin, mild cherry, and hints of green apple.  Brown sugar, vanilla, and cream.
Rich and thick feel on the tongue.  A bit of creaminess.  Medium carbonation gives a crispness on the tongue.  Some alcohol bite at the end.  
This is one of the classic Belgian Quads.  Rich complex flavors blend and compliment well. 667 charactersleroybrown10, Jul 16, 2013

Pours a hazy flat brown color that looks vaguely red when held in the light; pours with a huge airy tan head that fluctuates between four fingers and two. Fabulous retention; tons of fat, even lacing. Purt near perfect. 
S:
Sweet, earthy, and slightly tart. Some alcohol spice and yeasty phenols right up front with dark fruits, vanilla, wood, and rummy notes. 
T:
Rich, full, coating, dark. Soon darkens with cherries and a notable spiciness of cloves and pepper, alcohol is pretty present but not in the way with muddied chocolate and bourbon flavors, and a warm, tingly, boozy finish.
M:
My god... Fantastically varied. Really creamy and coating with prickly carbonation and a warming, alcohloic finish that still is quite clean-feeling. Medium- to full-bodied. As good as it gets.
O:
Really outstanding beer. It is nearly perfect in almost every way. 
Absolutely beautiful; a joy to pour. Rich, complex aromas topped off with flavors which are different than and complimentary to the nose. Made for sipping while clutching your snifter to get the most out of the changes as it warms.
No question I would get it again. Really a world-class brew. 1,155 charactersTheDoctor, Jul 11, 2013

S: Molasses and fruit and malty, bready goodness. 
T: Just like it smells, the opposite of a letdown. Like a liquid Jamaican Christmas cake. Sweet, but a cinnamon-like sting as it leaves. 
M: Thick. Carbonation is just right. The alcohol just blends incredibly here. 
O: Truly the best Belgian beer I have ever tried, and in my top ten favorite beers of all time. Yes, I've had a Westvleteren 12, but this is better. Whereas the Westy was too carbonated and short-lived like a darker Duvel, the Rochefort is thick, almost Doppelbock-like. A must have. 640 charactersclevelandhops, Jul 06, 2013

330ml bottle poured into a snifter.
A- a murky, dark brown with some ruby highlights, a big light tan head dissipates very quickly.
S- big hit of dark belgian sugar grape musk. Some muted ginger and cocoa notes.
T- Rich and malty. Reeeeally sweet. Has the medicinal/belgian sugar flavor that tells you it's a quad. I get the grape musk notes, and there's complexity in the deep malty base. Peppery, cocoa, ginger. Slightly boozy. Taste lingers looong after the sip. Could use a much heavier dose of dark fruits.
M- very smooth, almost creamy, but the quite aggressive carbonation breaks up the party. Suprisingly, it's a touch dry on the finish.
O- Well done, but honestly, just too darn sweet. I would much prefer more dark fruits be present in the taste. Lets be honest though, I'm nitpicking a bit. 847 charactersJWU, Jul 06, 2013

It was had notes of honey, banana, cloves, wheat, and some kind of liquor base, but not 100% sure. I have now had 3 six packs at ruffly $50 a piece. The only reason I don't have this at a 5.0 is because there was a batch that was off. I took it back to the LQ after drinking 3 and had them swap it out with the distributor because it was so bad. I know this brewed small batch style by Monks, so I guess I get it but at $8 a beer I really do expect perfection and often times I get it with this beer. 563 charactersSnowman, Jul 05, 2013

A- Dark, cloudy brown body with a half finger white head that doesn't stick around for long. It does not look still, but it certainly does look mysterious. No lacing.
S- Raisin, fig, caramel, vanilla, other dark fruit, a bit of earth, yeast spices. Complex and strong.
F- Caramel, dark fruits- cherry, raisins- yeast spices, a bit of vanilla, sweet dark malt. Gets even better as it warms up. Very aggressive on the palate.
M- Full bodied, smooth and rich. Slight sticky feel in the mouth. Some dark fruit sweetness and alcohol heat on the finish.
O- Aggressive quad with a great mouthfeel and a nice complexity. One of the best in the style, and so readily available. It's great! 743 charactersStevedore, Jul 03, 2013

4.51/5  rDev +0.9%This review is based on the most recent experience and the notes I've taken on probably 10 different samplings of this stuff. This review is long overdue for me.
11.2 oz(330ml) brown Rochefort style bottling. Very Belgian in shape from the base through the neck. The label is pure classic Trappist and gets the experience started off right. There's just something about liquids brewed by Belgian monks that just do it for me. This particular bottle was poured into an authentic Rochefort goblet.
A - copperish dark brown to a mahogany like color. Lots of haze with a ridiculous amount of Trappist funk sediment gracefully sitting at the bottom of the goblet. One of the murkiest beers you'll ever lay eyes on. Beige head sits lush on top residing to a fairly thick bit of lace. Pretty good stick clinging to the walls of the glass.
S - mmm.. Nothing like a good Trappist dark colored ale. Lots of dark fruit with plums, figs, and soft raisin taking the bulk load of the fruit. Even some cherry creeping in this aroma. Toast like malt. Slight caramel along with a whiff of molasses. Trappist brilliance with the yeast whiffs with some spice and pepper. Slight rum like booze in the back drop but very kind and not at all bad. A good booziness.
T - Belgian spice up front followed quickly by a wave of dark fruit that also provides the mouth with a layer of sweetness. More toasty malt with caramel and molasses all doing their part. A soft booziness that fits in perfectly. Another swing from the delicious dark fruit with spices in a somewhat dry finish. 
M - full and rich with flavor. Every single inch of the mouth is coated with a load of Trappist flavors. Complex and big yet the balance make for a drinkable quad. Well done.
O - I've searched long and hard for the Westvleteren 12 and rightfully so as each time I've had the Westy 12 is was out of this world, but each time I go on these searches I think to myself that I have an old friend sitting in every beer store in my area. That old friend has never let me down and constantly reminds me that it deserves the same sort of respect Westy 12 and any other great beer in the world gets. The class this has is unmatched and arguably the best quad in the universe. It's flavors can go 1 on 1 with any in the style and come out on top more than just once. This is as fine as Belgian Trappist ales get and we all know Authentic monk ales have class, but the Rochefort 10 takes class to another level and has remained there a long time now. A true Belgian jewel and a true world class quad that deserves more than what it's handed. Ill drink this til the day I'm no longer here. It's that good. 2,654 charactersBradtheGreat7, Jun 28, 2013

A: It's dark in here so hard to tell, but very hazy, dark beer, beer was poured carefully so head is minimal but responds vigorously to to swirling
S: Alcohol and spice come across as the dominant aroma
T: Brown sugar and yeasty spiciness, deep roasted candy sugar, not "sweet" but definitely on that side of the spectrum, alcohol comes through but adds to the complexity rather than just adding burn
M: very highly carbonated, but comes across somewhat smooth thanks to the full body, easy to drink too, very nice
O: A very good beer, I have a hard time saying one of the best ever, but it is a top example of the style. 665 charactersdpodratsky3, Jun 27, 2013

A: Dark, mud brown color with the faintest hints of ruby red when held to the light. A two-finger rocky beige head eventually fades, leaving sticky lace down the glass. 1/4 inch head retains until the end. There's a whole lot of crazy, muddy looking sediment that rests in the bottom on the glass, occasionally rising slowly with the carbonation and sinking back down. For some reason, that really excited me and I found myself raising this one to the light to appreciate it between sips.
S: Dark (but not overly bitter) chocolate, with hints of caramelized brown sugar. Anise and alcohol are faint, but present. Didn't pick up anything different the most recent time around. The caramelized candy sugar scent did seem a bit more upfront this time.
T: Holy cow, this one is rich! A thick, sweet malt flavor that blends flawlessly with the spicy, peppery alcohol. Bits of caramelized brown sugar and an array of dark fruits (raisins and figs are what came to mind first) underneath. Twangs of alcohol and brown sugar (or possibly just a mild molasses) come back for a last hurrah as it warms your throat on the way down. *Note: The beer was a little too cold initially when I took it out of the fridge, which caused me to miss a lot of the flavors on the first sip or two. Do yourself a favor and make damn sure you drink this at its recommended temperature. It's unbelievable how much complexity in the flavors shone through after I let this one sit a minute or two.
M: A mild, tight carbonation mixed with the full-body and creamy head make this drink more like a dessert than a beer! This beer is unrivaled in terms of smoothness, creaminess, and overall drinkability considering its alcohol content. There's a strong kick from the booze in the first sip, but it eventually fades away, leaving you with nothing but rich, creamy goodness.
O: This brew is held in high regard for a reason. A lot of skill and craft went into brewing this one and it absolutely shows--from the first sip until the last. If you have a chance to pick this one up, I highly recommend you do so. Pour it, sip it, savor it, respect it, love it. 2,199 charactersThePaintedGrey, Jun 24, 2013

Murky, muddy brown water. Yellowy tinge to the off-white foam that recedes quickly and then disappears.
Lot of figs to smell, along with raisin & prune juice. Held onto this for some time and there's no booze to smell and it seems quite settled.
Tastes of raisin and prune juice. Time has made it pretty approachable for the abv. Fruity, not boozy. 
Larger bodied, stil get some carbonation to stop it seemingly becoming too heavy. Warming, long almost vinous finish.
Good beer. Something I haven't drunk in seemingly forever. Consistent, a big warmer and something to savour slowly. I wouldn't rave about it, but its quite solid 700 charactersMrKennedy, Jun 20, 2013

Everything to me about this brew was exceptional to me aside from a Tad over carbonated for my "personal" taste.
The smell was terrific the taste followed the nose and overall it is a nice balance of everything... the look was ehh.. nothing to rave about but it looked pleasing. best quad I've had and a must get when you see it.

(11/07/17 printed on label; bought this in February, let it sit in the fridge until June)
L: murky caramel to darker brown with lots of debris; big head for a beer poured into a goblet, at least 1/4-inch or more. ugly as can be with all the stuff floating around in it, but the base color and head are awesome.
S: sour grapes/wine but with sweet malt ... sweet biscuits/bread. it's a constant back-and-forth between these two things for me: sometimes more wine, sometimes more sweet light malt.
T: lots of alcohol and very wine-like but damn is it good. sweet grapes with a fantastic malty foundation; it's like a candied sour apple. 
F: so perfect, so much carbonation with a perfect medium weight -- the carbonation makes it very drinkable and truly Belgian

Incredible amounts of yeast left in the bottle (bottom and sides). Thick, pure dark color from a nut brown pour. Holding up to the light reveals tons of yeast or malts out of suspension (slight detraction for me).
S - Cherries, prunes, dates, candi. Well blended and medium.
T - Initial notes of nuts, followed immediately by sweet cherries, prunes, banana, and candi sugar, followed yet again by a nutty malt, and finished with a wave of cherry sweetness. Some spices come through as it warms.
M - A little sharp and bubbly. Chewy; starts to foam in my mouth as I let it sit and chew on it. Slightest bit of warmth from the alcohol (11.3%!). Coats the mouth in sediment and yeast, especially as the beer warms, leaving an additional, lingering sweetness.
O - I really like quads, and this is the best I've had so far. I can't really imagine improving on the taste. Maybe I'll be forced to re-review after having Westy or St. B, but for now, this is one of the top beers I've ever had.
Bottle date says 140317; not sure how to read it, so I don't know how aged this is or is not. 1,168 charactersRoguer, Jun 16, 2013

Flavor is rich and thick. Lots of creaminess surprisingly. Big dark fruits with plum, dried fig, raisin. Nice malty caramel. 
Feel is super full and thick. almost chewy.
I think my palate is not quite developed enough to appreciate this beer. Lots of really complex flavors. I also think it will get better as it warms. But it is mind bogglingly good for the style. Just not sure I'm ready for it yet. Prepare your palate. 700 charactersdheacck11, Jun 15, 2013

5/5  rDev +11.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A: Thin head, maybe half a finger, that quickly disappears. Cloudy, dark brown, some visible carbonation, but mostly obscured by the cloudiness.
S: Rick chocolate, malt, and dark fruit, in that order. A little cream, too. Like Bailey's.
T: Rich, bold, creamy. Chocolate and the cream comes out first, some oakyness next, then malt and dark fruit linger. Flavor never fades. Very rich, but not in a sickly sweet way. Very easy to forget the ABV is 11.3%. I want to make beer syrup out of this and out it on everything. After a few more sips, I think I'm getting a little hint of orange, just slightly at the end. Might be crazy.
M: Smooth, a little silky, but less so than the 8. Lighter on the carbonation, too. Light for a Trappist, but not light overall.
O: This is my favorite beer. Drink it any and every chance you get. Incredible in every aspect. 856 charactersDreizhen, Jun 14, 2013

A - Poured dark brown/amber and hazy. Liberated 2 fingers of creamy tan head that slowly faded. Floating particles on pour that settled on the bottom after a while. 
S- Dark fruits, slight citrus, malty, toast/bready, alcohol but not strong. Many some toffee/caramel or chocolate? Very interesting nose. 
T - Just a wonderful mix of flavors, nicely complex. Similar to nose, with raisins, plums, cherry, figs. Slightly sweet on the palate. 
M - Good carbonation, smooth and a great boozy warmth. Considering the ABV it drinks nicely. This could easily catch up to me. 
O - Stunning example of a strong dark Belgian ale. I had it once before and I was hoping I wouldn't be disappointed this time around, I was anything but. Really a rich and complex beer. One that must be tried. 819 charactersdrrone, Jun 14, 2013

5/5  rDev +11.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Appearance: creamy head with bubbly appearance around ring of glass, dark brown, opaque, holds slight head nicely
Aroma: sweet malt aroma with deep dark fruit complexities, Belgian yeasty aroma yielding notes of prune, fig, pepper, with sweetness of heavy malt usage coming through nicely
Taste: rich malt heaviness balanced out by yeast fruit flavors, bready malt taste, with spicy phenols exhibited to counterbalance the thickness of malt, can taste the high alcohol content but not enough that you would suspect of being 11.5%
Mouthfeel: silky, tongue coating similar to a stout, slightly cloying but in a good way such that you take small sips and enjoy for long time. Slight prickle on the finish from carbonation and alcohol percentage. Moderately dry finish
Overall Impression: tremendous Trappist ale, further evidence that these beers deserve their own special classification. With strong notes of dark fruits and slight spiciness from hops to balance out heavy dark malt bill, this beer packs a punch that will knock you on your ass on the first sip. The heaviness will leave you satisfied but the complexity will leave you intrigued down to the last sip 1,168 charactersdwren89, Jun 12, 2013

Apparance: Dark murky brown amber with a thick white head. I can see particles floating around. 
Smell: dark citric fruits like plums, peaches, wine grapes, and a hint of alcohol.
Taste: raisin flavors, plum, dark fruits on the tip of the tongue and in the middle forefront and yeasty, bready, on the aftertaste. I can taste the alcohol in this one. I would say that the dark fruits are the most dominant flavors for me.
Mouthfeel: Highly carbonated, medium thick.
Overall: This is my favorite Quadruple belgian strong ale. It is blended well for the amount ABV it contains. It goes down very smooth for having high gravity of alcohol. This is a special occasion beer, and it is definitely meant to be sipped on. 757 charactersTonmeister, Jun 09, 2013

It pours a nice deep brown, with about a inch to inch an a half beige colored head. First blast of flavor is from the alcohol, and at over 11%, it gives you that almost hot sensation no matter how cold the beer is. Also ,as a side note, I would not suggest serving this beer ice cold. To really get it's nuances, serve it a little warmer around 40-45 degrees. After that there is a taste of caramel and pure heaven. The mouthfeel is very light. I will surely be enjoying this gem again. 634 charactersspmiller86, Jun 09, 2013

The mouthfeel is smooth, thick, viscous, with a low to medium carbonation.
Overall, this is definately a sipper. Big on alcohol and flavour, my favourite of the Rocheforts. 364 charactersDave1999, Jun 08, 2013

The rich aroma has notes of raisins, brown sugar, rye bread, molasses and alcohol.
Each sip of this medium to full bodied beer is soft, slightly chewy with moderate carbonation. This full flavored beer begins with sweet brown sugar, molasses, chocolate, and toffee. Mixed in are fruit flavors of raisin and dark cherry. It finishes with some burnt malt notes, some smoke and a little tartness. Once gone the brown sugar and dark fruit flavor lingers on the palate.
This is a full flavored beer that is savored with each sip. 686 charactersWanderingFool, Jun 08, 2013

O - This is an amazing brew and is a sipper. I'd choose this to celebrate a special occasion. I tried one fresh and have one aging that I'll try in a year. Looking forward to comparing the notes. 511 charactersandrewjraab, Jun 07, 2013

A very underwhelming 1 finger light brown head rises and then quickly fades away to nothing. Zero retention and lacing. Color is nice, but very shocked by the lack of head and retention based on the wonderful appearance of Rochefort 8
S- Rich, malty sweetness. Moderate esters of dried fruits- dark cherries, blackberries, and plum. Slightest hint of chocolate. Not the spice I detected in 8. More malt and alcohol in the nose on this one.
T- Huge, complex, dark, robust flavor. Relatively disappointed up to this point, but the taste kicks it up a notch. One of those "oh my" beers when it hits your lips. Tons of fruity sweet malt upfront that is balanced out by the phenols and alcohol, accompanied by a terrific level of dry bitterness. Remains smooth throughout.
M- Despite the weak head, the carbonation remains intact and makes for moderate drinkability. Near full body with full flavor. Dry from the sip. Alcohol is noticeable, but refrains from dominating the palate.
O- Don't get me wrong, this is a fantastic beer, but a little more flawed imo than Rochefort 8. 10 does have a more intense flavor profile though. Simply put, one of the most flavorful beers I've had to date. I would still lean Westy 12 for this style, but this is a very impressive beer in its own right.

S: Aroma is ripe plums and dates,: mildly boozy and yeasty smelling.
T: tastes of plums, raisins, dates,cloves hints of toffee and maybe the slightest hint of Turbinado or dark sugars. Very hard to nail it all down. Too many flavors to comprehend.
M: starts off as crisp but then does a 180 and finishes malty and creamy.
O: This is maybe my third sampling of a quad ever so I wouldn't say that I'm an expert on the style ' but this is easily my favorite of the others. I had this bottle in two sessions. The first time it was slightly over carbonated for my liking, too much like champagne. So I corked it and drank the rest the next day. I also paired it with some smoked Gouda and muenster . Wow what a difference. This quad has so much going on here . Yes it's cliche' but it is indeed very complex in all aspects. Believe the hype, It's that good. You know when you see a picture of a trappist monk and he's always smiling with a red nose and rosy cheeks? Now I know the source of his joy. 1,119 characterscrazyfoMostout, May 30, 2013

S – a full array of spicy phenolic fruity notes, an amazing complex aroma. Plums, black pepper, dried lemon, rich caramel, leather, so rich. Toast malt, lot of earthy character, with a hint of zesty alcohol. Barn warehouse, and a nutty aspect, peaches. Steller 5
T – spicy plummy notes and a toasted butterscotch note. Subtle clove spice with a zesty fruitiness, toffee cake, sea salt, slight leather, oak forest. A bit of caramel sweetness, rich red fruits, cherry, defintely a lot of port flavours and maybe some dark chocolate in there somewhere with the brown sugar, so smooth with great complexity. Full finish, warming alcohol, thick spicy malt. Balance is very good. Such a delicious complex quad. 
M – full bodied, very rich feel to it, luxuriant fruity spiciness, drinks far lighter than the abv, rich malty body, slick feel on the finish and nice dry warming aftertaste which really ties it together. Carbonation is quite slight allowing the flavours to really dance. Drinks very well. 4.75
One of the tastiest and most complex quads to be sure, such a full rich flavour to it that it carries through very nicely. A bit of a dry tannic finish. All round amazing beer, that is far too refreshing and drinkable to be 11.3% but then the richness hits you and the warmth, so good. 1,479 charactersmick303, May 27, 2013

Smell – A wonderful sweet scent, unlike anything I can describe. Maybe brown sugar, toffee, malt, and cherry with a touch of chocolate. But it’s very unique, and that description may not do it justice.
Taste – The taste is just as unique as the smell. Malty, with brown sugar, port, and a taste I find difficult to describe.
Mouthfeel – Perfectly carbonated, incredibly smooth, and the 11.3% abv is exceptionally well hidden.
Drinkability – Highly drinkable. I tried this alongside all the top quadruples (except the Westvleteren, which I’m saving for a head to head competition with the winner of this comparison), and found this one to be the best. 836 charactersFalcon91Wolvrn03, May 21, 2013

My preferred order was; Pannepot, Rochefort 10, St Amatus 12, Westvleteren 12, St Bernardus, Pannepeut, Sixth Glass and last Chimay. 
This one is really the best of the classic quads, aroma compared to other quads you get a lot more citrus and some refreshing notes. Taste is some almost blackberries and plum, very much dark fruit, and quite earthy, it’s a real dark fruit bomb, with belgian yeast and some licorice and really present lingering citrus spruce inputs from the hops. 613 characterssimont1, May 11, 2013

5/5  rDev +11.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I poured it in my La Trappe goblet that is pretty much similar to the Rochefort goblet.
A:It pours a dark brown caramel body with a red shimmer, a thick head in light brown cream colour. Lots of yeast on the bottles bottom. 
S:Begins with a strong wine smell, notes of ripe banana and caramel with a woody Cognac feel in the end.
T: As with other Trappists, Rochefort hides well its alcohol, but it can be felt because it bitterness and warmth. The complexity again remember other trappists with a complex mix of fruits, predominant ripe banana, coffee, caramel, hops and a woody wine flavor, some toasted malts can be felt too. 
M: Medium body with sweetness and fruit notes that contrast with the hops leaving a flavour not too bitter, but not too light as well, warm in the palate and low carbonation makes a smooth sensation. In the end a woody dry fell remember me some porto wine.
O: I cannot say I was surprise, because I aways expect the best of Trappists ales, but anyway this beer is another example of how good a beer could be, when done with carefully and attention. Rochefort 10 deserves its nickname "La Merveilleuse". (The Marvellous)
This beer have a complexity that is hard to be found in another beer and can be put right on the side of Westvleteren XII, Now I can say for sure that it is my favorite beer! 1,329 charactersRaphaelSC, May 07, 2013

4.84/5  rDev +8.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Appearance: Pours a dark brown (almost black) with amber notes if held up to the light. The tan head is a bit longer than an inch and has decent retention. The head leaves a minimal amount of lacing on the glass. Not to mention a fair amount of yeast that collects at the bottom of the glass.
Smell: Delicious - it smells like deeply spiced dark fruits, especially like figs and prunes. I detect a bit of vanilla and caramel as well.
Taste: The best - the spiced, dark fruits come and hit you immediately and a caramel and vanilla taste get you a bit later. The taste that lingers on your mouth is both malty and hoppy - as it should be. This beer is very complex, as well as being very well-balanced. The complexity of the flavors really help to offset the high alcohol content, which you can detect while drinking the beer. This beer almost tastes better as it warms up, like a fine red wine.
Mouthfeel: Mysterious, velvety, luxurious, and a bit dry all at the same time.
Overall: It's dark, complex, and has a lot of character - a lot like my mother. But seriously, I had to try this because it got such good reviews - now I can see why! It's a perfect beer if you just feel like relaxing, and of course, slowly sipping, on a great beer. Thanks to St. Benedict for setting up monasteries that can brew this great stuff! 1,326 charactersmoodyhudy, May 02, 2013

Westy XII is out there somewhere for me to try, but until then this is the bench mark I hold for all top tier quads. Damn this is good stuff. The nose is out of this world with figs, blackberries, raisins, prunes smelling liked they were soaked in a spiced rum and let age in a toasted oak barrel for a few months. Some goes for the flavor, except there is a little more noticeable alcohol on the palate. Either way, I am buying another one of these before the store runs out and letting sit for a few months. 549 charactersironchefmiyagi13, May 02, 2013

It looked wonderful, even though they had put it in a plastic cup (I was appalled, too).
The smell was wonderful (figs & raisins) and I couldn't wait to tear into it.
The taste & mouthfeel were as good as anything I've ever had; almost perfect. It was so good that I looked down after a few minutes and it was gone. Fortunately, they had a few more for me. That was very considerate of them...
Overall, this might have been the best beer I've ever had. However, when I got home and went out to buy a 4-pack or 2 for the house, I was jolted by the $25 price; it was almost cheaper at the bar by the beach!
This is a wonderful beer everyone should try at least once. 867 charactersMdez, Apr 30, 2013

Pours an opaque dark ruby, almost black, with a light tan one finger head. Really decent head retention and lacing throughout.
The aroma is full of dark fruits such as plums, raisins, dates, and figs. Is quite vinous with a very red wine-like aroma. Some notes of sherry and cranberry. Quite nice.
The flavor provides even more depth than the aroma. Plums and grapes along with sherry and a hint of vanilla. More dark fruit washes over the palate with some oak and plums. Bitterness is on the moderate side with much of the perceived bitterness provided by the alcohol. It is never harsh but is definitely noticeable providing a nice, pleasing warmth in the chest and throat.
Overall, an amazing Quad and one of the best Trappist beers out there. So many complexities in the aroma and taste it is a brew that every true beer fan should experience. 879 charactersrangerred, Apr 30, 2013

M - Medium to Medium+ carbonation, with a very silky smooth feel, the flavor lingering after the sip is not strong and actually tastes pretty good.
O - Very surprised by this, after having some other Quads. This feels like a goldilocks Quad, not too sweet, but not too dry, with good, strong, complex flavors 561 charactersBrewasaurus, Apr 29, 2013

A - Murky brown verging on a dark gold hue where the light hits the glass. A finger of khaki head that dissipated very quickly. Looks like a world class quad. Can't argue with that.
S - Caramelized alcohol soaked raisins/plums/figs. Big dark boozy fruits with some burnt caramel nose on it. It is insane how much you can get from just smelling the beer when you crack open the damn bottle.
T - Huge dark fruits up front. Rum soaked raisins might be the most prominent flavor. Caramel malt balance to go along with it. Very sweet, very palate friendly. This is tied for the best tasting beer I have ever had. Everything is so apparent and well crafted. The flavors are distinct and dominant.
M - Medium carbonation, and very smooth velvety mouthfeel. Medium bodied and a nice finish. While you can taste the flavors that the alcohol imparts on the fruits, it doesn't feel like you're drinking an 11% beer. It feels like 7% abv max. Very well hidden in the mouthfeel department.
O - It's hard to imagine anything better than this, in the Quad category. I will definitely try St. Bernardus Abt 12 soon, but it will be hard to top this. Maybe one day I will find some Westy 12, too. For $7 a bottle and easy availability, this beer is a fuckin' masterpiece. 1,321 charactersTitans77, Apr 26, 2013

A: There's a lot going on visually with this brew. Dark brown, cloudy, murky, yeasty, but definitely a treat to look at. Held up to light, you can clearly see the yeast settling to the bottom of the glass.
S: Slightly boozy. There's a grape hint to the bouquet, and a sweetness there, but there's also a warmth and bit of a nutty hint. Walnut comes to mind. Nothing overpowers, and it's really subdued compared to other Belgians I've experienced.
T: Caramel, chocolate, a hint of fruit, including a mildly fig-like taste intermingling with the other flavors. There is some apparent alcohol in the flavor, but it's not overwhelming or overpowering, rather serving to complement the other flavors. Fruit and booze linger on the finish. I almost tasted a hint of apple, but it was pulled in with the other flavors to make one of the most balanced Belgian tastes - if not the most well-balanced - you're wont to experience.
M: Very carbonated and very refreshing. Very crisp, is the word I'd also use to describe it. Rich, tongue-tingling. Mouthfeel also complements the flavor absolutely flawlessly.
O: This is a wonderful beer, albeit it a bit expensive to have on a regular basis. This is not an everyday beer, one that you will drink everyday after work. This is the kind of beer you reward yourself with, the kind for special occasions. It is absolutely superb. 1,429 charactersRenownedHack, Apr 25, 2013

Color is deep grayish brown with a lot of cloudiness and suspension. Yeast settles at the bottom. A lot of it. Head is about two fingers thick of off white to tan colored porous bubbles typical of Belgian beers. Good retention. Little lacing left by the receding head.
Aroma is more subdued than I would imagine from such a world class 'Belgian' beer. Strength is good but not excellent. A lot of resins. A good amount of malts. Strong yeast. Crisp notes. A huge mix of various dry nuts. Slight warmth and booze. 
Taste is of dry nuts, slight caramel, a lot of dry fruits and yeast. Booze is apparent as well, but for a 11.2% brew, the alcohol is not significant. Good warmth. Heavy stuff. Finish is semi-dry and semi-sweet at the same time. 
Mouth feel is medium bodied. High carbonation. Very nice texture. Strong on alcohol and warmth. Very heavy stuff. 
Excellent brew. Complex, yes. World class? - may be. 971 charactersAmitC, Apr 23, 2013

Dark brown with copper hues. 1 inch tan head that vanishes fairly quickly. Some brown, compacted yeast at the bottom even after carefully pouring but a little more expected for a BDS and/or Quad. 
Smell: Dark cocoa, slight alcohol smell, chewy dates
Taste: Out of this world. My all time favorite beer out of any style. BA reviewer and pro ratings are spot on - this is a world class beer. I get dark, slightly burnt cocoa - even more complex than the D-180 taste. Chewy rummy date, dark fruits, slight warming alcohol. I get some toasty marshmallow as it warms - debittered black, Cara-something in there along with the Special B. This is much, much more complex than just dark candi syrup/sugar and dark fruit. Any home brewer that can come close to its likeness has a gem on their hands. 
Mouthfeel: Crisp, dry, chewy, sumptuous and gets even better as it warms. A real treat to savor. 
Overeall: For 11.3 abv, the complexity really masks the boozy flavor - be careful - you'll be feeling great halfway through! This is to slowly enjoy and so I have numerous times over. This is a dark, masterful potion. 1,163 charactersCZs, Apr 21, 2013

Although written records of brewing at Rochefort date to 1595, Rochefort 10 was developed in the late 1940s and early 50s. It appears on virtually every list of the world's finest beers.
Taste
Dark brown color. Great strength balanced by a complexity of flavors and firm malt backbone. The bouquet covers a wide range: port wine, leather, apricots, oak, spices - a deeply intriguing beverage.
Serving Suggestion
Lamb shanks with juniper berries, wild chanterelle mushrooms, truffles, or dishes with intensely reduced sauces. Serve in the traditional stemmed Rochefort goblet.

A - Pours a deep brown color with a decent head, no lacaing.
S - Sweet scents, fruits also present, grapes/raisins
T - The taste profile follows through on what comes through with the smell. Dark fruits and the perfect amount of sweetness. The most surprising part is that the alcohol is not overpowering whatsoever. You wouldn't really know the ABV is 11.3%
M - Very smooth, carbonation can be described as a little less than average. Definitely a well-bodied Belgian. So far, this has been the high point of the sampling.
O - Don't get me wrong, this is a high quality beer. I had extremely high expectations. Reading how highly ranked it was on the website forced me to expect an extreme wow factor, but I think it came up just short. It's definitely worth a try and I would love to have another, but I'm not so sure that it met my lofty expectations. 925 charactersletsdrink, Apr 21, 2013

Very hard to tell that this is an 11.3% ABV beer (until you've had a few and find standing up to be a bit of a challenge!), pleasure to drink - there seems to be a hint of cherry or some other rich fruit tucked away in the after taste too. 467 charactersRobGreen, Apr 19, 2013
4.72/5  rDev +5.6%look: 5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Bought a 330 ml bottle. Served at room temperature in a Delirium snifter glass - a perfect fit since that's exactly the volume this glass holds, leaving room for the head.
A very beautiful head. Two fingers thick and very persistent - one of the best ones I've seen. In fact, this brew is so carbonated that the beer spilled over the moment I opened it. The beer is pitch black - I had to hold it directly to the lightbulb to see the deep burgundy color. The bubbles gash out from the inside of the glass like an erupting volcano. The head and color density is simply unlike any other beer - ale or stout - I've had.
Very pleasant sweet aroma of caramel, alcohol, and dried fruit. Smells very much like some Belgian strong ales I've had. 
Taste - I might have just tried the best beer I've ever had. Unbelievably smooth, well balanced sweetness and a rich warm alcoholic finish. 
The consistency is very rich, with super fine high carbonation, it has a slight anesthetic property on the tongue. The only drawback of this is that the foam occupies too much space in the mouth compared to the liquid.
This is a paradigm Quadrupel that needs no hype because it speaks volumes on its own merit, not to mention that it was made in Belgium. Definitely my new favorite of this style. 1,281 charactersretry4z, Apr 19, 2013

S: Although alcohol is present in the nose, the grains really keep the smell balanced overall. 
T: Wow, what a smooth beer! At 11.3%, you really don't get overpowered with the alcohol like some other beers with this abv. 
M: Carbonation is medium. When mixed with the abv, you get a really nice, yet slight, burn on the tongue. Really good coating on every sip.
O: I've been keeping two of these in the back of the fridge since Christmas. Glad that I finally tried one of the greatest, and well balanced, beers I've tried to date. Certainly worth the hype; and I love the fact that it is readily available in my area. 707 charactersjasoncheb, Apr 18, 2013

Appearance: This beer is cloudy and dark with a short life-span off white colored head. 
Smell: Smells like figs and cherries ( some other dark fruits maybe) brown sugar.
Taste: Amazing flavor. Complex in texture and flavor, has a lot of the dark fruit and dark sugar flavors that I have come to expect out of the great belgian beers. amazing beer.
Mouthfeel: Smooth and very lightly spiced. Seems to have low carbonation and a complex texture. 
Overall: This is a great beer and it has a great flavor as well as texture. This beer is on the same level as the Westy 12 (maybe not quite as good but it is close. Plus I can get it very easily at a local store).

S - Caramel and apples are prominent. A bit of alcohol when inhaling deeply but not overwhelmingly so. Some molasses or other sugary smell. I smells wonderful. It smells like a candy factory but not it's not cloying at all. It's almost like the smell of baking cookies but more earthy. 
T - the taste lives up to the hype. The high alcohol content is not noticeable. It is nicely sweet and fruity, but there is still an easy malt presence. It could pair well with a dessert, but it also has a strength that would allow it to pair with meat. It is powerful but also subtle and well balanced. Lots of caramel. Not much bitterness if any at all.
M - The only small criticism I might have is that the mouthfeel is a little thin. But, it is still solid and easy to drink.
O - this is a great beer...one of the best I've ever had. 912 charactersorangedive, Apr 13, 2013

The aroma is very fruity with a smaller head than Chimay Blue. It surely smells like big cherry. There is biscuit, malt, and raisins as well.
There is a smooth Belgian yeast. There is huge cherry. Then there is a bit of prune, plum, and stone fruits. It’s almost like rum with the sweetness.
It surely is the best of the blind taste I had with St Bernardus 12 and Chimay Blue. By far my favorite. Next to Pannepot Reserva, this is maybe my favorite quad. I recommend this extremely highly. 544 charactersdar482, Apr 12, 2013

i normally don't care for belgians, but this one would be worth revisiting:
solid head dies down to not a trace. no lacing to speak of. 
nose is subtle, softly fruity.
taste is, again, subtle, but much more pleasing than other belgians i've had. very smooth, refined, and hides its very high abv remarkably well. none of the artificial tasting flavors i find in most belgians. even once it's warmed, it is very cloy about its character. 
will have to put this on list of specialties to try again :)
superb effort by the monks! 632 characterslighthabit, Apr 10, 2013

Again, I get flavors of plum, raisons, chocolate, and a little roasted malt. Absolutely fantastic. Very little alcohol flavor and heat. The mouthfeel is heavy, thick, and well carbonated. Not too syrupy, but there is a bit of maple flavor. Overall, this is my favorite trappist/abbey quad. It's just awesome.

Paired with a Maple Bacon Biscuit from Huckleberry
A: Deep dark earth in color with a head of foam made up of variable sized bubbles
S: Complex sweetness consisting of candi sugar, cocoa, raisins and dark fruit. There is also a grainy smoothness with a smokey quality.
T: There is a rush of candi sugar which gives way to the earthy sweetness of cocoa and raisins with hints of dark fruit. The middle smooths out to a charred graininess and woodiness. The bouziness begins to warm the palate slowly building hand in hand with a dull, leafy bitterness to a moderately dry finish. 
M: Big with good smoothness; a substantial feel for a substantial beer. The carbonation adds to the palate without being a distraction.
O: Well balanced with wonderful dark sweetness and a well hidden ABV. An essential ale on the path to understanding and appreciating Trappist ales. 894 charactersElSid, Apr 06, 2013

Appearance: Large mocha/off white fluffy head, beautiful lacing. Very dark beer
Aroma: wow. so complex, very hard to describe. mostly figs, raisins, banana bread, dark fruits, smells like a sweet nectar thats been aged in oak.
Taste: World Class beer. Had a lot of hype to live up to, and the only other Belgian quad i've had is St. Bernardus ABT 12. I like this one better, has a sweeter smoother taste. Instantly you're hit with dark fruits, almost mango and cherry notes. This is followed by a sweet banana bread aftertaste, and the belgian yeast really shines through. The alcohol is faintly noticeable at best, as it's smoothly disguised in the dark sweetness of this beer. As most others have noted, these flavors really come through after it's been sitting out at least 10-15 minutes and warms up a bit. When its really cold it masks a lot of the flavor. Although its most noted as a sipping beer, wI agree is the best way to savor it's beauty, I caught my self trying to drink it very fast as it is just so damn good and refreshing. I highly doubt any other 11% beer has the smoothness and taste that this ale can offer.
Mouthfeel: Perfect. Perfect carbonation, you just want to cherish every sip. Creamy and full. So good when paired with stronger cheeses, would love to try Limburger with this.
Overall: This has moved into my current top 5, truly a beer to cherish. At 7.99 a bottle, not something I will drink everyday, but will be buying this over and over again whenever I need a great quad to just sit down and enjoy. If you're familiar with other non-trappist Belgian Ales, such as Duvel, Delirium, or La Chouffe, you'll immediately recognize the signature Belgian yeast tastes, but as a trappist quad, you really are getting an amazingly complex tasting beer used with the finest ingredients. Yea these beers have a lot of hype that i'm sure factors into a lot of reviews, and frankly, all the hype is warranted and well deserved. Looking forward to trying Westvleteren 12 next year when I get to go back to Belgium. My hat is off to these monks that still continue to make and supervise the production of this beer. 2,195 charactersRoman5150, Apr 04, 2013

Strong alcohol percentage and taste that litteraly leaves you breathless, this beer can be drunk at room temperature, or, naturally, at 5 to 6°C. Both will present totally different tastes. I would harshly recommand to have more than two today, because you're going to hate yourself tomorrow. Also, this should be one of the last beers that you taste today, because it will hide any other smooth beer's taste afterwards - they all might taste like water. 545 charactersFelixp, Mar 30, 2013

Appearance: deep, dark mahogany with a nice big fluffy head.
Nose: A spicy rye note comes out of the glass setting up your nose for an assault of dark, jammy fruits, banana bread, and sweet toffee.
Taste: Its a hard beer to describe. Endlessly complex. Layers and layers of bready malts, fruity esters, spicy pepper and rye, raisins, and dates, and tobacco. 
Mouthfeel: Rich and creamy. No 11% ABV to be found.
Overall: One of the greats for sure. It's a tough to write tasting notes for because there's just so much going on. Somehow it doesn't feel overcrowded though. Everything somehow works together and produces a very complex finished product. 672 charactersfdig23, Mar 26, 2013

S- Pungent smell of dark fruits. Raisins, plums, figs all seem to hit the nose. Malts as well. Very easy to pick on the smell for me, which is not typical for many ales/beers for my nose.
T- Taste like it smells. Smooth, sweet but not overtly. The dark fruits dominate it with the sugar smoothing out at the end. Hides the taste of alcohol extremely well. hardly any bitterness. will knock you on your ass if you're not careful
M- Smooth. Medium body, just right amount of carbonation. 
O- A fantastic representation of the style. I enjoy it more than I do the St Bernardus, which is also excellent. You can't go wrong with this...unless you keep drinking it and don't realize how strong it is. Considering it's ABV, it's worth the close to $7 a bottle. 877 charactersSwedgin_Wu, Mar 26, 2013

4.3/5  rDev -3.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Wow. brilliantly clear deep mahogany with a busy and frothing lightly tanned head which recedes rather quickly to a thin half finger of tightly wound bubbles. 
bottle best by date 05/18/2016 so almost 3 years of age. Nose is the best of belgian dark scents I've had the pleasure of smelling before. Dark fruits, dark belgian candy sugars, plums, rum soaked raisins, dates, a bit nutty and woody, licorice, blackberries, and raspberries. 
surprisingly much different than expected. Close to flat with a medium body that breaks up nicely across the tongue. Only the faintest touch of detectable alcohol for such a big abv brew. Flavors are sweet, deep, hidden, well blended and pretty balanced. Sweet malts up front followed by a dark fruitiness with a tart belgian candy spike. Woodyness with a big plum and raspberry flavor, a dry yeasty character, faint cherry like medicinals. Alcohol balances the sweetness pretty well but sweetness lingers a bit. Overall a beer that is truly something else, Worth the high price tag. Super complex, incredibly subtle, and super drinkable all at the same time. 1,099 charactersjtierney89, Mar 26, 2013

4.82/5  rDev +7.8%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.7511.2 oz bottle, poured into a Rochefort chalice.
Appearance: Pours a reddish, dark brown color. About a finger and a half of a sticky, frothy tan head. Leaves a fine, bubbly lacing on the glass. Absolutely opaque and murky, with no visible carbonation. Traces of alcohol legs left on the glass.
Smell: Big, complex aromas to this one. Lots of sweet aromas upfront, malty, like a sweet bread. Some spicy notes, baking spices - cinnamon, nutmeg. Hints of brown sugar or molasses. Lots of sweet fruits, some vinous grape notes, some darker, dried fruit aromas - raisins, figs, dates. More and more of these coming out as the beer warms up, blending together with just some subtle notes of alcohol on the nose. Just a huge, complex variety of aromas that unwind in the nostrils.
Taste: Like a complex code deciphered on the tongue... just so much to this one. Almost a wine-like tartness to start here. This soon fades into a dark fruit dominated sweetness - raisins, figs, date flavors again with some sugary, caramel, toffee notes... like brown sugar coated raisins. Beneath this, the sweetness lingers and mixes with some pastry bread notes, with some spicy, earthy notes... like a cinnamon, raisin bread flavor. Finishes with a spicy bitterness that sweetens as the beer warms up. So many different flavors unlock on the palate... just an incredible taste to this one.
Mouthfeel: Big, full body to this one. Coats the mouth - the tongue, the cheeks, the roof of the mouth. Almost thick and chewy between your teeth. Big carbonation feel scrubs over the tongue, readying your palate for each next, new layer of flavor. Warming feel in the mouth and throat from the alcohol. Hearty and filling.
Overall: In my opinion, this is an excellent beer. So many different experiences for the nose, the mouth - just an absolute joy to drink. This is definitely one you want to drink slowly and savor. It seems readily available and though it can be expensive ($6.99 for 11.2 oz, in this area), in my mind it's worth every penny. A perfect beer to break out on a special occasion. This is an absolute favorite of mine and I'd highly recommend trying it to anybody. 2,157 charactershermit990, Mar 23, 2013

It pours a reddish brown, with a white lacey head. The sediment is obvious and adds some nice character to it. In my experience, beer with sediment is usually good. The smell is sweet - you get hints of fruit, malt, wheat. It tastes sublime. Incredibly smooth, not too sweet on the tongue, but finishes sweet and sugary.
This is a must buy! 495 charactersjmendels, Mar 20, 2013

4.86/5  rDev +8.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5First review here on Beer Advocate so I'll follow the formula for reviewing that other posters have used and hopefully this is a good attempt. 
Appearance: On pour dark brown with fluffy white foam top that did not last past a minute leaving a trace of lacing around the edges.
Aroma: Sweet with overripe fruit, no identifiable hops
Taste: Sweet with figs, raisins and some other unidentifiable fruit, strong and bold, no bitterness, the alcohol for such a high ABV is so well hidden that it is unidentifiable
Mouthfeel: Even carbonation throughout the tasting a little heavy in the mouth but feels good
Overall: Great taste and not overbearing on the palate 
Although I have not tried very many beers I really like this one, and will have it again (I re-review it too), once I have expanded my palate with other beers. The alcohol content was too high for me so I was only able to drink little more than half, but when I grow a tolerance I'll give it another shot. 966 charactersMACARONInmsu, Mar 18, 2013

S- So aromatic, big and potent. First big wiff felt like heaven. Did I already mention its extremely potent? Dark fruits; raisins, plums, figgs. Bready notes and alcohol. 
T- Dark fruits dominate the palate up front but are mellowed out by the sweetness of the sugar. Even a little cooler then what this beer should be served at and I can still taste the alcohol from the moment it hits the tongue till the end, but that adds to the taste. 
M- Perfect carbonation and medium bodied.
O- Very tasteful and satisfying belgian ale. A bit pricey for a 11.2 oz bottle but is worth every penny. It is so complex and unique that you really can't complain. 732 charactersintensify, Mar 02, 2013

Aroma is amazing. Lots of dark fruits and some phenols. Did I mention it was amazing?
Taste almost as good as the nose. Fruits and phenols again, with a good aftertaste and hidden alcohol. Mouth feel is a little over carbonated at first, but settles into pure creaminess.
This is an amazing beer that goes well with meat and cheese. One of the great dark Belgians. 530 charactersLabeorphile, Feb 22, 2013

That's really the best way I can explain my constant, unwavering decision to pass up bottle after bottle of Rochefort 10 over the past 3 years. It's never been difficult to find. It's always been on my hit list. Yet, far too long into this hobby I find myself finally reaching for it on the shelf. Very standard bottle poured into a FFF Rastal (and then the proper Rochefort glass for kicks) on February 17th, 2013. 
A - Not quite as dark as I recall ABT 12 looking. Still, a soft mahogany with light tan foam on top. Fair retention, good lacing, and very prominent alcohol legs.
S - Earthy, dried stone fruits. Soft leather, roasted pecan, and country bread. Less prune. It smell as much an old ale as a quad, lacking just the primary note of true toffee sweetness. Cherry picks up as this reaches room temp.
T - The differentiator here is solely in the yeast. It's intoxicating from front-palate straight to the finish, and it morphs profiles from a lightly bitter, dry cashew and rough molasses into an amazingly deep bready character, offset with citrus interplay. Toasted rye, honey, and grain meld together in the periphery.
M - Medium body, low and absolutely perfect carbonation. Dry finish. Completely smooth.
D - Lord, what will this beer do to me? It makes me question all time and effort spent trading, hunting so much else. I committed the same crime hundreds of times by passing this up. 1,415 charactersAuracom, Feb 19, 2013

A - Beer is a murky dark brown and does not let much light through. The head is fluffy and tan colored and piles 6-7 cm high initially. It fades to a thin skin and thick lacing around the glass. 
S - The aroma is dominated by dark fruit (such as figs, dates, prunes) and butterscotch. There is a woody, earthy note that could be from spices or yeast. Very complex and rich. Some alcohol booziness.
T - The taste is nutty and buttery and full of dark fruit. Some treacle and brown sugar, but no roasted or acrid notes. There is a moderate backbone of hops bitterness and a rum-like alcohol flavor. The finish is dryer than one might expect.
M - Medium body. Carbonation is low. Not much alcohol burn, especially considering the high alcohol content. Hops bitterness is a solid backbone, but not excessive. 
O - This is a beautifully made beer that is simple but gives an incredible depth of flavor. Easy to see why it is considered a world classic. 994 charactersRadome, Feb 17, 2013

A - dark brown almost 3 fingers of pillowy off-white head that recedes very slowly leaving a really thick lace around the glass.
S - sweet, dark fruits, lots of plum and fig, much like a fine port.
T - the deepest nicest sweet caramel taste, seems to linger and it's just perfect. this particular bottle is a bit hot from the alcohol but still such a treat.
M - thick , coats the mouth, perfectly carbonated.
O - my favourite of any quad i've ever tasted (had westy :)) this is easily a favourite beer of mine, it's always such a treat. TRY IT!!! 598 charactersrappmann, Feb 13, 2013

Nose is fruity yeast with a Charleston Chew candy aroma. Malty and yeasty both fit as main descriptors. Alcohol and cola come out as it warms
Flavors of cola, Tootsie Rolls, strawberries, raisins, brown bread and Nesquick. Body is full, but not quite as much as SB and Westy. I find the cola and licorice flavors to be a bit much and I know I am in the minority on this one, but I find Rochefort 10 to be a bit less delicious than both St. Bernardus 12 or Westvleteren 12. The alcohol pokes out a tad more and the sugars seem more...well...sugary than the deep bready malt/yeast combo the other two offer. That said, this is still a delicious beer that integrates the ABV so well that there will never be a 'cringe' involved…so smooth for an 11+ %’er. 865 characterstwiggamortis420, Feb 10, 2013

I don't know why but I tend not to review beers that are readily available. I think there's a natural tendency for a beer geek to mark their territory on rarities, but I didn't start reviewing to puff-up my peacock feathers, or run around at festivals bragging about my BA top 20 checklist (although this happens to land there). I started making the effort for myself, as a sort of beer-journal, so I could mark and associate many varieties and styles of beer, and see how my palate changed over time. Well, it's about time I got around to reviewing this. I've probably had this 10 - 15 times, each time it seems to taste exactly like the last bottle, but I always notice an extra layer or nuance. Let's break it down:
A: Cloudy, almost muddy-red in appearance, as a ton of suspended yeast seems to completely confuse the light bending through the glass. The beer looks 'heavy' as it seems to have a clearer complexion in the top centimeter of the beer. Whatever head there was dissipated awhile ago, with no trace of lacing.
S: The nose is dark ripe fruits with a tropical bend. Kind of a fig-meets-banana thing. There's a butterscotch tone at the boundaries of the bouquet, giving this a winter holiday feel. Subtle notes of toasty, slightly grainy malts linger in the background.
T: Unlike other reviews, I didn't really pick up the alcohol in the nose, but it jumps to the front of the palate on the sip. This brew is young, I just grabbed it from a bottle shop, but the boozy aspects are much more prevalent on the palate. It works, though, because there are many layers to the profile and the alcohol becomes a spice as the other flavors kick in. Again, ripe fruit, especially figs and plums, are met with notes of buttery rum and holiday spice. As the beer warms, a nice toffee or brown sugar aspect becomes noticeable, but is kept in check by the alcohol warmth. One of the more amazing things about this beer is the finish, which is surprising short and sweet.
M: It's rich, but not as heavy-bodied as you'd expect. A lot of that is from the ample carbonation, but there's a light, almost splashy feel to the beer. 2,165 charactersrand, Feb 08, 2013

Appearance: Dark brown, opaque, half a finger of head without much retention, minimal lacing.
Smell: Raisins, figs, grapes, apples. Quite sweet. 
Taste: Extremely sweet with a nice malty syrup quality. Same fruit character as the nose, with mainly figs and apples. Hides the 11% ABV amazingly.
Mouthfeel: Moderately carbonated, a little less so than other quads. Sticky, wet, smooth.
Overall: Really a world-class quad. Perhaps a little too sweet for some people, but so easy to drink, hides the alcohol so well, it's really a treat. $7/12oz means that I won't enjoy this every day, but on special occasion, it's the best quad sold in America, and I'm lucky to have it readily available. 755 charactersMCain04, Feb 06, 2013

The head that is left behind is a ring around the side that is a nice shade of tan. lots of suspended yeast and no lacing. 
S - smell is a complex deep malt character, dark fruits, nice oak tone, nuttiness, slight alcohol. 
T - Rich malt taste, slight buttery-ness, molasses, get a lot of oak, vanilla and nut notes. definite fruit character throughout, finishes a little sweet. Not much for hop taste or bittering hops, bitterness falls short of balancing the sweet. Taste profile is very even though, its complex but distinct. 11.3 % abv is well hidden. 
D - Very easy drinking, medium body with light almost effervescent carbonation. 
O - Very good, i love the oak notes I'm getting in the smell and taste, doesn't look too good expected more for head retention and lacing. Over all a solid quad, but I wouldn't say the best. 1,025 charactersMaineBrewing, Feb 02, 2013

The foam settles in a decent amount of time, leaving a light frothy layer across the top of the beer. There is some serious lacing as it drinks.
S: I get raisins, banana, grape skin, and soggy bread. It's not the best smelling beer, but it's pretty typical for the style.
T: It starts off sweet with big raisin and brown sugar notes. The soaked bread, banana, and even clove flavors, comes on in the middle. As the beer transitions the sweetness remains as some alcohol notes begin to shine through. Having said that though, it's very well hidden. I would not imagine that this is an 11+% beer, if I didn't know what it was, or that it was a quad.
M: Full bodied beer. It's sweet and coating to start, bready and yeasty in the middle, and sweet and slightly boozy in the finish. This beer coats the palate but slides off nicely.
O: Very good beer. I'd drink this again. Quads typically aren't my favorite style, but this beer is really pleasant. It's a sipper though, for sure. 1,066 characterstrxxpaxxs, Jan 28, 2013

A: Pours a rich brown with some red color, somewhat translucent. Very slight head that died off quickly. Little lacing. Very well carbonated that settled quickly.
S: Sweet, malt, some caramel, raison, dark fruit
T: Taste rich malt, but surprisingly, the taste is not as sweet as the nose. That is a good thing. Lots of spice, raison, and dark fruit. The alcohol is amazingly well hidden. I can tell it is there but it all balances very nicely. Great taste with some complexity and spice that lingers nicely in the mouth. The flavors and balance seemed to be shifting as the beer warmed up so please sip this one slowly and enjoy the full range of flavors this Belgian offers.
M: Surprisingly light mouth feel, perhaps because it is so well carbonated. It still coats the mouth nicely and lingers without being sticky or sweet.
O: A great beer that is worth the price. I have one 2011 left, I plan on buying a few more bottles to age a few more years and then try a vertical so I can determine exactly what aging does to this beer. This first beer is definitely a hit. 1,239 charactersimscotty, Jan 28, 2013

Carbonation is plentiful. At first smell i get plums or even raisins with some spice to it. The taste confirms it. Wow it was amazing. A light feel was surprising to me but welcomed. One the best beers Ive ever had. Well worth the price. 353 charactersHopLuva, Jan 26, 2013
5/5  rDev +11.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Full review, second had.
Served in a chalice from the bottle. 
A: a beautiful dark brown with slight ruby hinted in the light. A nice one finger head gives way to a small and tight froth.
S: fruity and sweet. The plums and dark fruits come forth as do a bit of yeast that makes this complete.
T: the Belgian yeast comes through along with the fruityness and some nice dark raisins or molasses. 
M: full carbonation fairly smooth and the booziness is mild.
O: this is a fantastic example of a Trappist quad. I've had several of the type, including Westy 12, and I have to say this is my favorite. It is just a complete beer...pure and joyful. I just wish it was a little easier to get where I am. 701 characterspolloenfuego, Jan 26, 2013

Pours dark brown, slightly cloudy (I turned the bottom upside down, so without agitation, I probably got as much sediment as I'm going to get), medium-to-small light tan head. Lots of fine fast active carbonation. Smell is the expected dark fruity with a surprising spicy note.
Taste is great. I understand why this is so highly rated. I get a little of the dates, and a tiny hint of cherry sweetness, and some plums with overripe plum tartness, more of that mystery spice from the aroma, yeast/breadiness, plain alcohol if you pay enough attention...This is still fairly cold, so the already bright flavors might further brighten as it warms.
Mouthfeel is surprisingly light and airy. Overall, this definitely beats out St Bernardus ABT 12, which I love. I think the primary factor is that this isn't as sweet, which lets other flavors come out more. 901 characterssnaotheus, Jan 25, 2013

S: Sweet and sugary notes mingle with some interesting spicy accents, a yeasty base, and some dark fruity flavors. Really rich and layered, but not overpowering.
T/M: Goes down dangerously easy for such a strong beer. Smooth and sweet and tasty, with dark fruits up front, some sugary sweetness, a strong yeast flavor underneath, and towards the end a touch of bitterness on the back of the palette.
O: Just an amazing Belgian that lives up to its reputation. It's so drinkable and tasty that it's easy to gulp it down forgetting about that hefty ABV. Great stuff. 642 characterssevenarts, Jan 23, 2013

A: Pours a deep brown with hues of chestnut and garnet. The off-white head is huge, rocky, and comprised of fine bubbles. Retention is superb, lacing sticks to the glass in thick, uneven patches.
S: Peppery spice is apparent on the nose first. Definite black pepper and a good dose of herbal spice. Bread crust, bread pudding, molasses, chocolate covered caramel chews, bakers chocolate, just a slight hint of charcoal and smoke. Darkfruit aromas of plum, black currant, and concord grape. 
T: Chocolate cake, rich caramel, molasses, slight coffee-like roast impression. Touch of smoke. Christmas pudding. Darkfruit flavors of plum, black currant, and concord grape. Subtle pepper and spice notes support nicely. Alcohol is dangerously well-hidden. Fleeting earthy, tea-like hop impression. Drying finish of plum, bakers chocolate, and peppery spice. 
M: Big and thick in body. Chewy and syrupy. Carbonation is surprisingly low for the style, but it does enough. Very creamy. Only a slight warming sensation from the alcohol. 
O: This is one brawny quad. It's definitely on the sweet side for the style, and it has more body behind it than many of the other Belgian quads I've had. It seems like a sort of brawn rather than brains trade-off. It isn't as nuanced and complex as some of the best quads, yet it's more drinkable despite its size. The alcohol is masked so well that it never occurred to me that this beer is 11.3% abv. That is until I stood up and had to catch my balance. Rochefort 10 is always in the discussion when the 'World's Best Quad' title is debated. It is very good, but now that I've had the time to sit down and cast a more critical eye over it, I don't quite think it's there. It falls just a hair short of its competitors. 1,859 charactersryan1788a5, Jan 22, 2013

Appearance - Pours a deep mahogany color with a finger of off white head with decent retention, some lacing but not much. Packaging is interesting, since it came all the way from Belgium before it hit my lips!
Smell - Dark fruits (figs, raisins), dates, certainly some booze! The boozy character comes out as it warms more. Caramel also makes an appearance
Taste - The dark fruits are again in full effect at the beginning of the drink. Strong malty backbone is present with breads in the middle and towards the finish. Some sweetness, again the caramel are also players on the palate. Complex, but a little underwhelming.
Mouthfeel - Finishes smooth, with a sweet kick and a definite alcohol burn. The booze is hard to run from here.
Overall - This is a good beer, and certainly an experience given it is one of the Beers of Fame, from Belgium, and expensive, but honestly, I think there are plenty of better Quads. Don't get me wrong, it is excellent and highly recommended, but I'd take Three Philosophers over it anyday, especially for the price. But check it out when you get a chance. 1,290 charactersTheCondor, Jan 21, 2013

A: pours dark molasses brown, with very carbonated head that is just below that of cola.( fizzy head that dissipates rather quickly).
S: the smell is quite light to my suprise. big bready yeasts, grain, some sweet brown sugar, light hints of dark fruits, very light sweet molasses. pretty underhwhelming.
T: more brown sugar, molasses, touches of dark fruit and even some acidic tangerine, and an ever slight slight touch of banana bread. i do pick up a slight chocolate and bubble gum that helps pull this together. alcohol is present but is definitely lighter than what was expected. i also pick up on a spice but its hard to pinpoint exactly what it is. 
M: on the lighter side of medium, with big carbonation. but it coats the mouth with a terrific sweetness that distracts you from the big 11.3%. there is an alcohol heat, but it honestly fits perfectly with this brew
O: solid beer all the way. the belgian yeast is simply awesome and the complexity is off the charts. with each and every sip, a new aspect is introduced to the palate. 1,075 characterstut2528, Jan 21, 2013

a soft, easy pour turned into a billowing, huge head which creeped ever near the rim of the mug. super tight, creamy head, though! beautiful, dark murky (to claim an adjective from the last reviewer) and i also get where he identified a little 'purple'.
2nd pour resulted in the same over-foaming and beautiful lacing. hoping to get the entire 11oz bottle in by the 3rd pour.
smell is of dark fruits and malt and the taste is the same.
overall, it's a great brew. especially for the abv. i prefer the 6 and the 8 over this one but i love the whole line up regardless. quite a wallop in two 11 oz beers tonight. 649 characterspkalix, Jan 20, 2013

4.89/5  rDev +9.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5So here's the thing. First of all, from what I've heard, this beer is not as consistent as St. Bernardus, and it tastes significantly better when aged (I am currently aging a bottle till Christmas 2013 or 2014, and will edit this review upon strengthening my notes). Also my notes got cut off in transfer to evernote, so I don't have any written recollection of the mouthfeel. It is, however, just behind St. Bernardus on my list, just outside the top ten (of over 800).
A: A cross between ruby red, purple and murky brown with a brown head. It looks like your typical quad, which is seldom a good thing, but it is a damn good beer, and should not be downgraded for looking as it should. In a word. Murky.
S: Alcohol, grape and banana. Better notes to come.
T: Grape, malt and a slight taste of alcohol. Ok I am CERTAIN there is more going on here. I will definitely update my notes on this one. Perhaps I'll buy another bottle or two, age one and drink the other right away to assuage my shitty note guilt.
M: ....Uhhhh... full bodied and smoothish? I don't have any notes on the mouthfeel. Sorry.
O: TASTE IT! It's excellent, among my top 15 out of more than (edit) 800 beers, and the second best quad I've ever had. But do age a bottle four a couple years.
EDIT:
Tried after cellaring for two years.
A: Dark brown with a thick mocha head.
S: Plum, fig, raisin, other sweet dark fruits that smell boiled down, thick and concentrated. 
T: Dark fruits, sweet, syrupy, but not overbearingly. Brown sugar, vanilla. DELICIOUS
M: Thick, full bodied, a bit foamy, but pretty smooth.
O: If you buy a bottle of this, delicious as it may be, save it. Save it for two years. You will get down on your knees and praise the lord above. 1,736 charactersBierJager89, Jan 17, 2013

A - Darkest of the four quads. Virtually opaque with red tints. Decent head retention with a paler head than the other three.

M - Lots of unfermented sugar, very thick and chewy.
O - The winner by a nose, a very great brew and relatively affordable. Would drink again. 432 charactersZach136, Jan 16, 2013

4.49/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from an 11.2 oz bottle into tulip. There's is some kind of date on the bottle but I have no clue what the hell it means.
A: Poured a deep brown. Looks like liquid chocolate even though it does not smell like it. about 2 fingers of really light tan. As of right now when I'm reviewing this, there is about a finger and a half of head.
S: Upon my first sniff, I caught a very strong smell. Some dark fruits such as figs and raisins. Caramel and malts are also prevalent in the nose. There is also a slight scent of alcohol.
T: Some fruits start this out with some caramel coming through immediately after. A strong malty backbone with a bready flavor finishes along with a slight alcohol burn. Burnt sugar makes up the sweetness that is quite consistent with throughout this brew. The aforementioned alcohol burn is nothing that takes away from the flavor of this beer. Definitely some good stuff here.
M: Medium to heavy bodied. The bready malts linger on the palate and make this a bit chewy. As I previously mentioned, the alcohol is slight but enjoyable. And the chewiness makes me yearn for another sip. Well done.
Overall: I have had 1 or 2 quads and my life and this brew exemplifies what a quad is. The alcohol is pretty well hidden for a brew with 11% ABV. The complex flavors are fantastic and you can tell that these Belgians put a lot of time into their brews. This makes me want to try a Westy and see how they compare. I'm not sure if I'd buy another one of these at 7-8 bucks a bottle, but I will say that it's definitely worth it. Great job Brasserie de Rochefort in Rochefort, Belgium! 1,612 charactersRichD, Jan 14, 2013

I live in a state where they did not distribute their American brick. Am I going to pay hundreds for a brick on ebay? No. No way. What to do? I want a great belgian quad. The best. Well, what is close? Matter of fact, what is now just as good on the top beer list? Rochefort 10. 
I must say, indeed, it does serve its ranking. Great nutty brown/amber color, with a huge off white head that lingers forever, leaving massive lacing. Huge clumps of yeast left in the bottle, despite an intentional swirl ( hey, I love yeast!). 
The nose is filled with a wide variety of soft aromas. Brown sugar, dark fig, plum, caramel covered apple, molasses, burnt sugar, and lots of bready yeast. Caramel malt. 
The taste follows, and oh boy, is it beautiful. Beautiful bready fig malt, lots of plums, dark sugar, dark fruit, slight apple and pear, low alcohol warmness, some spicyness from the yeast and the alcohol, but highly drinkable. 
Mouthfeel is carbonated, creamy, smooth. Incredibly thick. I can't believe this is almost 12%. 
World class, to say the least. 1,121 charactersGroenebeor, Jan 10, 2013

4.89/5  rDev +9.4%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Appearance 4 - Beautiful dark brown colour with orange sparks. Very cloudy. Superthick ever-lasting light brown head, with darker spots of sediment (I should've stirred the bottle a bit before opening). Cute, even bubbles. Average lacing. Medium to low carbonation, but hard to see through the hazy colour.
Smell 5 - Very strong, heavy and pleasant smell overall. I smell dates, overripe fruit and caramel, some soothing spices and lot more of what I can't identify. Also some roasted malt.
Taste 5 - Quite multi dimensional with sweet fruit, coffee and malt. Heavy, bitter, dry tail. But also some alcohol aftertaste, which is quite understandable and not at all unpleasant. I am overwhelmed by all the flavours in this beer, wish I could describe all the goodness better. Letting it warm and rest a little releases quite a different pallete of flavors.
Moutfeel 4.5 - Pretty heavy of course, but sizzling and somehow quite crispy, refreshing and surprisingly drinkable.
Overall 5 - The most expensive, the most interesting and also probably the best beer I’ve ever had... in a way. I wouldn't drink this every day and surely more than one at a time is sort of a waste. I would call it a dessert beer for special occasions. 1,230 charactersJosefSabl, Jan 09, 2013

Wanted to revisit this one ever since we had it on Trappist Bier Night in May of '12. After sampling about 10 beers before we got to Rochefort, I got the sense that my palette had already been practically destroyed by the time we got to this delicious brew.
Love the look and smell of this beer: dark mahogany brown, with plenty of rich, dark fruits in the nose. Figs, raisins, and a little caramel mixed in with a hint of dark chocolate. Mouthfeel is out of this world: rich, creamy feel but the finish is actually drier than you might expect. 
Paired this with a lamb burger, and I'm pleased I did. This is a "Telling Stories By a Brick Fireplace in the Dead of Winter with a Hearty Meat Dish" sorta beer. Distinct flavors score points here - blindfolded, I could pick this one out of a lineup. Also, insanely drinkable for 11%. A must-have, must-have-again Trappist. 913 charactersbrewsclues, Jan 08, 2013

I hope the bottle I had was a bad batch. It had a lot of sediments in it as well.
Used a duvel tulip glass to drink this.

Tacky foam clings stubbornly to the edges like glue.Competing tartness and sweetness on the nose. The tartness has a cider quality while the sweetness is quite chocolatey. I note some caramel apple in the aroma as well. Smooth, creamy mouthfeel that gradually dries just before finish. I pick up a lot of alcohol warmth. Apple, chocolate, caramel, and a bit of brown sugar in the flavor. Just a little overly tart around the edges of the tongue, which throws it out of balance just by that much. The alcohol flavor bitters the finish in an unappealing way. Pretty good, but no Westvleteren. 656 charactersDocJitsu, Jan 06, 2013

L – Ruby brown color with a 2-finger rocky tan head that fades into about a half-finger of creamy, frothy bubbles that lasts throughout. Obviously great retention but again only a bit of lacing.
S – Here comes the dark fruit parade – plums, currants, raisins, figs, and black cherries. All the fruitiness is backed by a nice caramel malt and molasses presence along with peppery, grainy yeast and a bit of alcohol.
T – A little bit of alcohol heat is noticeable up front but after that fades (or maybe after I begin to get used to it) the beer sweetens out very nicely with caramel malt, molasses, brown sugar, plum, raisin, and currant flavors. A nice amount of black pepper and clove spice appears at the finish along with a bit of a grainy component. I can’t quite put my finger on this taste, but it’s been apparent at the yeasty finish of each of the Rochefort beers.
F – Medium-to-full-bodied with perfect carbonation for the style (just enough without being tickling), a creamy and smooth yet an occasionally and pleasantly biting mouthfeel, and a sweet, spicy, and dry finish. There is a nice throat-and-palate-warming sensation from the alcohol, but for a beer this ABV, the alcohol is nearly unnoticeable.
O – This is an extraordinary beer. This is one of my first experiences with quads, but I’d like to see what Westy has on this one. It has all the elements I was hoping for in a strong dark Belgian beer and has a fantastic mouthfeel to go along with it. It’s unbelievable how 11.3% ABV is almost nowhere to be found. This finally rounds out my Rochefort journey. I need to get my hands on the other Trappist beers. Beers from the newest brewery of this kind are up next. 1,767 charactersBlackBelt5112203, Jan 04, 2013

Aroma- Slightly sour smelling with hints of fruit cherry and tobacco. Vinous and buttery 
Appearance- cloudy brown with a light tan head. Coarse tan head that dissipates quickly. slight legs on the glass and no lacing.
Taste- fruity and funky. cherry plum raisin blackberry slight spicey-ness (clove all spice). a touch of black Olive maybe... Alot in common with a Port or Wine than a beer. Jammy- but not overly sweet. The Hop character really settles out as it warms. also hints of carmel and molasses in the finish. It is definitely a treat for those into the belgian style.
Mouthfeel- slightly over-carbed but slick with subtle alcohol warming.maybe a little cough syrup-y not in a bad way
Overall- wow I could see myself enjoying this with a cigar or towards the end of a heavy meal I think it would pair well with lamb or prime rib any sort of rich savory dish. I don't know if i could handle multiple pours of this one but it does taste pretty darn good. This style can come on pretty strong and can sometimes be too sweet but I am really enjoying it. 1,091 charactersUncle_Jimmy, Jan 03, 2013

4.35/5  rDev -2.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured into Westy XII glass
Pour: A dark amber brown with a finger size head and a good amount of lacing. Just dark enough to prohibit light from penetrating. Some sediment at the bottom of the glass. 
Smell: The belgian yeast is forefront here with a bready mix. I get some dark fruits and a nice whiff of alcohol. There is some caramel and maybe a mild chocolate. Actually a little underwhelming to me.
Taste: Dark fruits like raisins and figs, soaked with alcohol comes to mind first. It is quite sweet and boozy with some caramel and bread, too. The belgian yeast is very prominent in this beer as is the alcohol, especially in the aftertaste. It has a very smooth warming feel to it and it is quite a feat at how well all this is pulled together close to perfection.
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with a super creamy and smooth feel. Has a rather high carbonation level but somehow does not detract from the smooth feel. 
Overall: Well at $6 per 11.2oz this is not a bargain but well worth splurging every once in a while. A very nice treat and an excellent example of the style 1,083 characterssleuthdog, Jan 03, 2013

A- Pours a muddy borwn body with a medium 1" head that leaves some lacing. A few flakes of settling are present. 
S- Tart green apple, belgian funk, molasses, baked bread. Slightly roasty.
T- Starts off with a burnt candied sugar and dark fruit flavor, ends with a sweet caramel, almost smokey malt note. Some booze in the background but quite tasty and sip-demanding. 
M- Creamy with a medium-heavy body. Low carbonation. An easy drinker. 
I was impressed with this brew and I do have to say that it lived up to the hype, minus the appearance (the flakes were my fault, but really took away from the whole experience. Next time I'll pour it easier). It was super complex and enjoyable to drink. 769 charactersgcamparone, Dec 30, 2012

M - Stunning that this is so high in alcohol, its expertly hidden. Sweet on the palate and a truly even finish. Amazing!

A: Thin off-white head (slow pour to avoid sediment entering the beer), a swirling of the glass leaves some nice lacing that slowly creeps down the glass. Extremely dark brown opaque body that's typical of a quad. 
S: Smell is also typical of a dark Belgian ale. Sweet upfront, mainly fruits, raisin and pear dominate. Rum is also quite noticeable after some swirling. 
M: Medium body, trending towards thin. Good carbonation at first, but it doesn't last long into this session. 
T: Immediately hit with pears and raisins. Rum in the middle. Spicy then pepper and anise towards the finish. Finish is semi-dry, and then a noticeable alcohol presence. The beer takes on a port wine-like quality both in taste and appearance (the carbonation is completely gone) as it warms. 
Overall: I've had this beer multiple times, and my experiences have varied from amazing to simply good. The alcohol was a bit too dominant and took away from some of the more complex flavors for me. This has been my experience with bottles of Rochefort 10 that I knew were young. I think some aging would do this ale wonders, so I might revisit this with a review of a bottle that's a few years old. 
This one tasted a bit too boozy/rum-like for my taste, I prefer a softer, fruitier Belgian dark ale. By no means would I score this a 3, as it's far from an average brew, but in the same vein I can't score it a 5. 1,485 charactersAlcahueteJ, Dec 25, 2012

4.73/5  rDev +5.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Appearance - Poured from the bottle into a goblet. Very, very dark brown with a tan head about 1 finger thick, dissipating slowly.
Smell - Not overpowering. The nose consisted of subtle hints of dark fruit and bread. About halfway though, a slight alcohol smell was more noticeable.
Taste - Dark fruit flavors spread over the palate. Sugar and malt flavors do a good job of masking the alcohol content. Aftertaste was slightly dry with the fruit flavors lingering and only then was I able to taste the alcohol sneaking out from underneath only slightly.
Mouthfeel - Very refreshing and not as "heavy" as I'd expect from a quad. Very palatable and each sip was more inviting than the last. Moderate carbonation.
Overall - Easily the best Quad I've had. I enjoyed this at Monk's Cafe in Philadelphia and prior to this tasting, had only been able to try the 8, so finally getting to meet the 10 was a memorable experience. The Rochefort 10 carries an abundance of taste and fills the palate with a variety of dark fruit flavors. Very refreshing feel to it for the style of beer. If you're looking for a world-class quad, this is it. 1,133 charactersVinnyA, Dec 23, 2012

The nose is boasting tons of dark fruits with distinct bready malts. Big quaffs bring out the beastly ABV. Sweet aromas take the reigns.
The flavors are huge. Sweet plums, figs, raisins and prunes are all mingling together. Sweet bready malts dominate the finish. Here, the ABV is extremely well hidden.
Mouthfeel is creamy and thick with moderate carbonation. Pretty sweet and sticky.
Overall, this is a top tier quad for sure. This is an easily drinkable quad that is easy to find and down right delicious. 598 charactersChugginOil, Dec 23, 2012

T- amber malts, some brown sugar and dark fruits, slight bitterness, good amount of spices and decent bit of booze near the finish.

4.58/5  rDev +2.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Price: $6 / 330ml
Appearance: Reddish dark main with rusted perimeter. Standard khaki head for the style which is thick and low. 
Aroma: Rich in spices, fresh baked bread (like all trappists), and of blue berry jam. Smells slightly of alcohol which is contradicted in the flavor. 
Flavor: The usual caramel and brown sugar but rich with fresh dates, figs (and for that matter prunes), malt, hints of nutty bleu cheese. Purple fruit flavor overall with butterscotch and raisin finish. Has an almost… powdered cocoa mid-palette or maybe it’s just from the sweetness fading to tart. 
Overall: Deceptive for such a dark beer to be as smooth and light bodied as it is. Heavy alcohol flavor but with such a high ABV that is nearly impossible to avoid. The only acidity detected would be that of a stale orange peel. Medium to low carbonation.
Placement: This beer is worthy of putting on a beer list.

One finger tanned head, very good retention. There top of the head had a small scar on it from the pour. Aroma was very pronounced, could be smelled from much further away than usual. I detected musty grape. Tasted caramel, figs, brown sugar, molasses and malt. Booze was so well hidden I wondered if they put the decimal point too far to the right! If it hadn't been for a slight burn at the finish I couldn't have detected any. Texture was moussy, silky smooth and light. Overall amazing. Look, aroma and texture achieved perfection. 638 charactersjonb5, Dec 18, 2012

A: Pours deep murky ruby reddish brown color. Like others have said, looks like Coca Cola. Initially about a quarter finger of off white head. Faded quickly into ring. Doesn't look too carbonated, but looks can be deceiving.
S: Smells like a quad: figs, dates, raisins, brown sugar, molasses, etc. Great nose.
T: Dark fruit bomb. It's pretty fabulous. Big fig. Big prune for sure. Brown sugar sweetness. Some toffee notes. Finish is lingering sweetness.

I watched the small bubbles of carbonation reach the top in a continuous stream. The color is of a blurry red/brown, cloudy and layered its quite fetching.
Remarkably fragrant I get dates, some sweet citrus, licorice and raisins. Very nice in the nose it's nicely complex but even a little simple. The scents are not hard to notice and blend well.
The taste is sweet, I get the raisin first, then a light but fleeting citrus. Problem I sense is that an alcohol brashness ends the taste. This alcohol harshness lends to mouthfeel as well. I allowed the Ale to warm and it seemed to be nicer closer to room temperature. I began to get some apple, a bit of fig, the date and far less harshness.
I regret drinking this at a lower temperature and will keep it closer to 60F next time. Very nicely constructed Ale with great range a nice complexities. 949 charactersKYGunner, Dec 17, 2012

"It's always on the shelves, I'll grab it next time." Next time finally came. 11.2 bottle put into a truly undignified plastic cup. 
Pour is much darker than expected, looks like Coca Cola cut with an ounce or two of 7-Up. I can see the carbonation columns running up the beer. Very nice caramel coming off the surface of the liquid, & a nice port-like vibe. Rich. I like it. 
Rochefort 10 requires a few contemplative sips before judgment. Taste is brazen sweetness: figs, raisins, dark fruit withered by the midday Arabian sun. Touch of spice in the middle & the finish; the Belgian yeasts, I presume. Finishes with more sweetness & a touch of that port-ness crossed with rum. If mahogany had a taste, it would taste just like this. Really easy to down for a big beer, with little to no alcohol bite. 
I can see why this is so revered; but alas, it doesn't quite turn my handle to that level. Very good beer that I'd never turn away. 1,049 charactersmaximum12, Dec 16, 2012

A - Pours deep, dark brown with reddish hues. Two finger head and tiny bubbles racing up the sides. Extra light, but full lacing. 
S - Dark fruits at the forefront, followed by carmel, cocoa, warm bread, & a hint of spice.A touch of alcohol adds some warmth.
T - Comes in dry with the same dark fruits you get right up front on the smell backed with a full palate of sweet malt. It settles in with some green apple and just a touch of yeast and hops in a very mild way. Washes with the sweet burn of a certain grand orange liqueur. Something completely unique to me in a Quad.
M - Body is medium and on point, but not as dry in the mouth as the alcohol content might lead to expect. Bubble tickle the bottom of the tongue with a beautiful effervesce, and it keeps that throughout the entire beer. 
O - When you can't shell out $85 for a six pack of XII, the "worlds #1 beer." Settle in for this and you won't be disappointed. There isn't a lot to say when you have a beer this good. World Class! 1,049 charactersilltexzona, Dec 15, 2012

4.39/5  rDev -1.8%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Not a style I know terribly well, but certainly the nicest I've yet tried. My personal bias as not a fan of Belgian yeast notwithstanding, this is a smooth and complex sipping beer that would stand up against any fortified wine or spirit.
Pours a muddy chocolate brown with many flakes that settle at the bottom of the tulip. Little head and an oily surface finish, with limited carbonation. Believe these characteristics all to be very style-typical. Aroma of Belgian yeast that mellows into a caramelized and dark toffee malt as the beer gets to the correct temperature. Super smooth taste that blossoms in the mouth, very complex yet I’m struggling to find an adequate description. Sweet, sour and even salty, with a lingering Belgian yeast finish and an underlying sharp bitterness. For me, that latter element is a pleasant surprise.
World class and deservedly so. Glad to have had the opportunity to drink one! 920 charactershopsolutely, Dec 14, 2012

A: deep dark brown with a finger of khaki head that recedes to a film. Not much lacing.
S: a bit more mild of a nose then the 8 which suprised me. Although as it warms a nice caramel and vanilla, a bit of fig, prune and raisin as well. A bit of alcohol as well.
T: a good amount of sweet dark fruit, along with apple, brown sugar, caramel, very well rounded and tasty, the alcohol is very well hidden, very tasty

A - dark, dark, dark! Classic characteristic of a Quadruple. Smallish head, no lacing.
S - sweet dark fruits, can smell the octane; but it isn't overpowering.
T - coffee, chocolate, and figs - in that order. Interesting development of flavors. Octane is detected halfway through, but mellows out.
M - nice slight tingle from both carbonation and octane. Leaves a pleasing burn as it travels down the throat.
Overall, beautiful brew. The complexity is overshadowed by the simplicity fashion when it hits the palate. Highly recommend it if you like dark beer. 588 charactersHTownGuy85, Dec 11, 2012

The nose is of strong dark fruits and some clean alcohol mixed with esters and a subtle smokey phenolic character. The taste is similar, this particular bottle has a stronger alcohol burn than previous bottles I had. Carbonation pop up front with a nice dark raisiny malt to follow with phenolic fruit and esters, touch of smoke, some peppery yeast, and as it finishes some sweet pilsner malt comes in. The mouthfeel is crisp on the front and drying on the back.
Overall, this is an exceptional beer, one of the best Quads out there. Maybe a little expensive, afterall I could get a 750ml bottle of Chimay Grand Reserve for a dollar more where I live, but it is well-deserved of its praise. 734 charactersSiriusfisherman, Dec 09, 2012

M - Silky and creamy. Medium-full bodied with tingly carbonation. Slightly dry with warming alcohol.

A - really spectacular looking beer, extremely dark, poured an enormous amount of foam (semi-forced pour), receded slowly into a few millimeters hanging around the top of the liquid. Dark, almost purple, less brown than black, hard to describe. Unlike other Quads or Belgian Darks I've seen.
S - subdued. I'm taking big whiffs and not finding as much as I would expect. The most prominent note is a sour one, almost like a gueze. A little alcohol comes off the top, but even with a huge sniff I detect only the faintest inclination of flavor.
T - wow, just a great taste. Simultaneously sweet and tart, biting and inviting, natural and synthetic. Tastes like candies I ate when I was a kid, but without the artificiality. There's something really hard to detect in the taste, almost like a sweet pilsner, but with much more character. Really complex. 
M - pretty good, the carbonation is a little much, but the alcohol is crazily subdued. I can't believe this is 11%+. The flavors dissipate just quickly enough to make you want to take that next drink.
O - tastes great, affordable, year-round, ubiquitous. This is a really great beer, one that I will definitely get again. 1,228 charactersJamesShoemaker, Nov 29, 2012

This beer pours a dark, dark brown with a modest creamy tan head. Served mine in a large snifter.
Nose: Even with a slight cold, the aroma comes through in a robusr way. Yeast, chocolate, port, dried fruits and dates, caramel ... Lots of good stuff here.
Taste: wow, wow, wow. This is ever so decadent, exotic, and well, sexy too. Chocolate black forest torte, cooked cherries, pumpernickel, holiday fruits, and stewed prunes. After a few sips, the finish evolves from a rich but tamed sweetness, to very, very light sour notes - though still retaining a sumptuous character.
Mouthfeel has light carbonation that doesn't get in the way of the taste profile. This one not only coats the mouth broadly with superb flavors, but the olfactory zone also gets a pleasant infusion with every sip.
High marks across the board. Monks hit a home run with number 10 of this edition. 958 charactersartdob, Nov 28, 2012

I'm starting to think Belgian Quad is simply not my genre. I recognize the greatness of Unibrou, Delirium Nocturnum, Chimay Blue, and this. The complexity is hard to beat, for sure. The spiciness, the dark fruits, the warming booze. Certainly a pleasurable sipper. And my wife likes it a lot. No dislikes from me.

Dark brown, with almost purple haze, and a light khaki head. Murky and thick. The smell is very complex, aromas of dark fruit, sweet bread and wild yeast. The taste is a complete amalgum of several sweet and sour notes, with plenty of dark fruit, sweet cherry, bready, buttery malt and banana like touches on the back. Extremely layered and refreshing, thick and smooth, but somehow drinkable. It's an amazing beer that has nothing but depth and complexity to offer. 575 charactersBigBarley, Nov 25, 2012
4.77/5  rDev +6.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5A – A deep milky brown that is somewhat opaque with a smaller head of bubbles wherein the bubbles are almost clear, and a limited head. Rather limited lacing.
S – The nose is incredible. Chocolate, vanilla, dark fruits—raisins and figs, clove, and it has a rum-like element that really gives the aroma a punch. Just serene, it really smells so damn good. I think I’m going to be in for a trip with the taste.
T – This is really just impressive. The taste is sweet and boozy with so much rum-soaked dark fruit with the raisins and figs, vanilla, black cherries, chocolate, cloves and tobacco on the finish as well as a slight bubblegum. But really it's just how well it's put together. It has that inexplicable X factor that differentiates a good beer from a great beer. This, is a great beer.
M – The mouthfeel is amazingly smooth for such an incredibly complex beer, this is owing to a thoroughly outstanding carbonation that is consistent up until the end, where it finally tapers off. It also has a wonderful warming sensation. Overall the mouthfeel is probably the weakest aspect of this beer apart from appearance, but that in itself is a compliment because the mouthfeel is very good.
O – Overall, this beer is simply top-notch. It's right up my alley, too. I loved the Rochefort 8, just loved it, but this is just transcendental--a kirby especial. High ABV, super smell, taste, and mouthfeel--one of my favorite beers on the planet. Godspeed gentlefolk, and I suggest you enjoy either of these Rochefort on momentous occasions; as their caliber is such that it would be ideal for any sort of commemoration. Truly divine beers, with the 10 being just slightly preferential. 1,697 charactersKKB, Nov 25, 2012

S- Belgian yeast and bread aromas mixed in with dark fruits. Fig, raisin, sweet cherries and even a slight chocolate note.
T- Dried fruits come through a ton along with the Belgian yeast and even somewhat of a lager-like presence. Grainy bread flavors show up in the middle with the finish having a noticeable alcohol presence.
M- High carbonation, very smooth and drinkable as a sipper.
O- Good, but left me wanting a little more. I remember this being slightly better the first time I had it with much less of an alcohol presence. 704 charactersstephenjmoore, Nov 21, 2012

4.39/5  rDev -1.8%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Great burst of foamy tan head quickly fills the glass. Dark amber to light brown liquid settles down in the glass. Rosy red highlights around the edges. Lacing slips off the sides rather easily.
Scents of caramel, dark fruits, raisin bread. Sherrylike aroma - grapes and alcohol. 
Sweet with some bold flavors up front. Starts with some roasted grain. Quickly becomes nutty and vinous. Ripe, sweet plums with some toffee.
Medium body with surprisingly dry finish. Hints of alcohol vapors in the finish.
Amazingly smooth for a big beer. Alcohol shows up in the background but some really complex flavors are profiled front and center. Aromas and tastes you wouldn't think could come from just grain, water, yeast and hops (and some sugar) are all over this brew. Perhaps a curve ball for the wine enthusiast who thinks beer is too low brow. Or better yet keep it for yourself and let your wine sniffing buddy miss out. 921 charactersneophilus, Nov 19, 2012

4.32/5  rDev -3.4%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Appearance: Deep nutty brown color with a fizzy tan head.
Aroma: Bready malt, dried fruits, hint of alcohol.
Taste: Very complex and robust. Dark malt, plum, raison, cocoa bean, and molasses. Each flavor surfaces and then disappears again between the first half and the second half. This is a beer that commands your attention as you drink. The chocolate becomes more pronounced later on. There is a hint of alcohol on the palate and a gentle warming effect but otherwise I wouldn't know this was 11.3% ABV. Almost no bitterness and an extra burst of concentrated caramel flavor in the finish. There was an ounce or so left in the bottle so I just poured the rest into the glass. The added yeast gives it a slightly more bitter aftertaste and a hint of sourness. Still a great beer.
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with above average effervescence (exactly what is expected for the style). Real smooth and creamy despite the carbonation.
Final Thoughts: After drinking Trappistes Rochefort 10 it's no wonder why this beer is so highly acclaimed. The robust palate and drinkability speak for themselves. At $7.99 for an 11.2oz bottle it's not exactly a steal, but it's worth the price for those who seek the best things life has to offer. Would I drink it again? Yes, when I'm in the mood for a robust palate punching experience. 1,325 charactersJamesMN, Nov 14, 2012
3.97/5  rDev -11.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.511.3 ml bottle into a snifter
A: Pours a hazy dark amber color with two fingers of off white head. Retention is very good. A film of head sticks around throughout the beer.
S: Lots of dark fruit - I get prunes, plums, and dried apricots. It's really like an assortment of dried fruits in a pungent, sugary way without being light or juicy. Behind the fruit, I get clove and a bit of licorice. The aroma is pretty complex and intense.
T: Intense dried fruit starts off again, though the flavor is a bit more muddled than the amazing aroma. I'm having a bit of a harder time distinguishing specific fruits. The flavor is certainly more burnt than the aroma, I get burnt sugars with prunes. Spice is a bit more subdued than the aroma, I get a bit of clove. Booze is quite evident but not overpowering, and the finish and aftertaste is strong dried dark fruits and a bit of licorice.
M: Medium mouthfeel with creamy carbonation.
O: The aroma on this beer is amazing - near perfect. So complex, so intense, i was impressed. The flavor is nice, but a bit muddled and a bit sharp. The finish is a bit harsh. 1,105 characterscoreyfmcdonald, Nov 14, 2012

S: Sweet, dark fruits (raisins, plums,  figs, cherry), biscuit, spice, alcohol and belgian yeast. 
T: The taste is complex and consists of big bready and vinous notes, dark fruit, nuts and alcohol. Alcohol is pronounced, but very smooth, balanced and drinkable. 
M: Creamy, medium-heavy mouthfeel and medium carbonation.
O: The alcohol peeks through a bit more than I would like, but overall it's a great beer. It's also easily accessible, so bonus points for that. 589 charactersLaChupacabra, Nov 14, 2012

A- pours a beautiful deep deep red/brown. A one finger white head that falls after a minute and leaves a layer over the top the entire time. 
S- DARK FRUIT. Dried figs, plums, cherries, and a slight alcohol warming. The alcohol does not make it apparent in a noticeable way, but it does provide a warming in the aroma. It's a comfortable aroma. Belgian yeast, too. 
T- follows the nose well. Chocolate covered cherries (the liquid kind with the alcohol). Fills the whole body with it's flavor. LOOOONG finish. The alcohol makes itself known in the warming but not the flavor. Rich beer. 
M- Full. Perfect carbonation. Silky smooth. Leaves pockets of flavor in your mouth for you to find. 
O- Amazing. About as close to perfection as you can get. A true beer of beers. Something I could drink for years and never get bored. 942 charactersMichigan, Nov 08, 2012

Rochefort 10 pours a very dark mahogany, no real highlights to speak of. Just over two fingers of bone colored foam rise up and crown the beer, and manage to stick around for a good long while. Little in the way of lacing though. The nose is fairly fruity, though more figs than some of the dark fruits that are more typical in a quad. There's just a bit of brown sugar sweetening up the ester profile, and a subtle clove aroma completes the picture. The fruit flavors, while still fig centric, lean just a little bit more towards plum and raisin than the nose (though I find myself wishing they did even more so). I find myself really enjoying the faint suggestion of brown sugar present, it's a nice, unique touch for this kind of brew. The spicy clove phenols are again relegated to a supporting role (which is how I like them). The body is fairly light and agile mouthfeel wise, but the carbonation could benefit by being just a bit brighter and more lively. I don't know if Rochefort 10 is my favorite quad, but it's surely a classic. 1,161 charactersaxeman9182, Nov 05, 2012

The taste has a sweet backbone which helps give this beer its sturdiness. I like this beer although I'm not a huge fan of quadruples. I can taste that this is a well crafted beer. It has a real purity of flavors that is unusual. The water they use is really clean and good. It gives the flavors of the beer a sort of transparency that allows one to easily identify the different elements within the beer. Nothing is muddled together. There's no background noise. Glad I finally got around to trying this. 566 characterswd40, Nov 04, 2012

That being said, that would mean it was brewed yesterday and then traveled overnight to my local corner store in Florida. I don't think so.
That being said, it means that this bottle had to be extremely fresh. The head retention is fantastic and the smell is even better. Plum, raisin, everything you would expect. The taste very nearly mirrors the smell, however there was a surprisingly medium-high level of carbonation that I will chalk up to being an extremely fresh batch. Mouthfeel was a lighter than expected as well, but no complaints here.
All that being said, definately a top 5 quad, a vintage would undoubtedly be even more exceptional. 761 characterstravisdiener32, Nov 03, 2012

It's really cool that the monks draw the water for this beer from their well that is located inside the brewery. It's pretty murky with almost no foam. Small bubbles champagne like. Taste like caramelized barley, caramelized so heavily so it's so sweet like a slightly burned sugar. It was $7.00 for 11.2oz in the store. I expected a bit more razzal-dazzle for the price. Overall it's a good Belgian Trappist Ale, but not exceptional. 472 charactersobninsk23, Nov 02, 2012

A - Dark red in color with quite a haze to it. The head was tan with big bubbles but dissipated right away. No lacing. 
S - Unrippened raspberries come to mind first off. Not getting any sweetness. Maybe a little woody character. Wine like, some raisins in there. I don't get any oxidation. Alcohol is apparent. 
T - The malts hit right away with a nutty flavor. Little bit of initial sweetness but short. Alcohol is all over the flavor. Midpalate is very wine like, dry with complex red fruit qualities. Finishes very warm and the alcohol leaves a spicy warm lasting impression. 
M - Medium to full bodied, low carbonation, semi-dry.
O - A little disappointed in this beer to be honest. Though very complex, it lacked some dimension in that it starved off all sweetness, I expected all these flavors and a little more. I thought it would hold a tight head longer. Still a good beer but maybe I was just overhyped for it. 962 charactersJparker37, Nov 01, 2012

No idea how this beer got in their fridge. I do know that the counter guy with rotten teeth gave me a big thumbs up when I presented a couple of these at the checkout, which I reciprocated. Big thumbs up, then ran like hell.
The other reviews correctly note the 'notes'. All those flavors -- real and imagined -- are present. I will say that this beer is about as good as a beer gets in a bottle. On a coldish night, it will warm your bones while you stand there shivering not knowing what planet you're on, where the keys went, or why your car is on fire. 
Coming across this beer in the south of Italy -- it's like encountering an old friend you never met. 764 charactersamendt, Oct 31, 2012

Appearance: It has a nice dark brown color to it with some amber hues. It has a nice creamy off-white head that dies down slowly and leaves some nice lacing.

A-The beer poured a dark cola color with hints of red. I was a little zealous with my pour and got a few bits of sediment. There was a one-finger, mocha-colored head that thinned out slowly. 
S-The beer has brown sugar and cola smell that was not nearly as fruity or heavy as I would have expected. Instead, there was just a touch of dark fruit like raisins, figs, and plums. I also picked up a bit of mineral-like alcohol.
T-A smooth flavor of well-integrated malts with hints of pepper complement the dominant brown sugar and dark fruit. The maltiness gives a little bit of chocolate flavor that gives way to a clean, medicinal alcohol on the finish. The alcohol, while noticeable, is well integrated at 11 point whatever percent.
M-There is a brief burst of carbonation on the opening that transitions into a medium bodied brew. A nicely balanced, slick feel to finish.
O-Very Euro...I dug on the subtle flavors and complexity, but could have used a little more wow factor to really push this into my top tier. That being said, I wouldn't hesitate to drink this again with some cheese. 1,132 charactersspoony, Oct 26, 2012

4.15/5  rDev -7.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5the best of the three by far in my opinion. pours mostly clear copper orange color with a very vibrant just off white head with pretty solid retention. kind of looks like oatmeal on top, thick and starchy. the nose is mildly spicy from the yeast, notes of dried fruit and molasses as well. the taste gives more hints about the fruit, apricots, cherries, and raisins come to mind for me. the yeast is less spicy than the nose indicates, but its still got some exciting peppery wild funk to it. the mouthfeel is quintessentialy belgian. a little sugary, super carbonated, and exciting on the tongue. the caramel malt notes last well through the finish, and my only regret is that i didnt buy a couple of these. the alcohol is totally invisible, impressive! a beer that only gets more eventful as it warms up. a really world class exemplary product. 846 charactersStonedTrippin, Oct 16, 2012

Pours a dark brown. Small head that disappears very quickly, leaves just a small ring around the glass. Lots of bubbles in the glass. 
Nose is caramel, sweet cake, some chocolate. After it's warmed up a bit some dark bread comes through, together with some fruit notes; maybe very ripe cherries? 
Taste is caramel at first, brown sugar and some chocolate. Then there's some malt and bitterness which balances the sweetness really well. Definately feel some alcohol on the tongue. Later it gets more creamy, with light fruity notes. 
Mouthfeel is fresh, not very heavy at all, lot of carbonation which fades after the glass is half empty. 
Amazing beer. Though this one might be just a little bit to sweet for me. I'm normally not that big on beers with a lot of alcohol volume, but with this beer everything is well balanced and the alcohol doens't overpower at all. This would probably be better after it's aged a while longer though, this bottle is not as complex as the 8 I've had recently. 1,033 charactersMaakun, Oct 15, 2012

Lovely, complex aroma of dried fruit.
Just great flavor, super complex, with lots of sweet, dried fruit mixing with alcohol. Cherries, dates, plums, raisins and more. Hints of chocolate. Wow. A rare 5 from me.
The body is also great: creamy and slick.
At almost $7 for a 11.2-ounce bottle, this is a rare treat. It lives up to its world-class reputation. A must-have. 465 charactersShaw, Oct 14, 2012

T: Booze-laced grape, dark grain, fig, brown sugar. Crisp and dry while retaining some pleasant sweetness from the candi sugar and malts.

Appearance - beautiful black with a big, thick tight foam head that's about 1/3 of the body size. Head gradually disintegrates to a pencil-sized thickness and remains.
Smell - Hints of caramel, refreshing milk chocolate aroma
Taste - same as smell but the caramel lingers.
Feel - Perfection from the absolute TINGE of a bite as it hits the tongue to the smooth crossing before it goes down
Overall - delicious beer. Lives up to the hype. Amazing drinkability for a ABV north of 11%. 527 charactersjimilayne, Oct 12, 2012

Appearance: Dark Brown with caramel hues. Lots of sediment. Good carbonation that lingers around as a thin froth.
Smell: Full caramel. Dark Sugar, even some plum notes with some other dark fruit.
Taste: Dark fruit. Dark Sugar. Toffe, a little plum and oak. More sweet than the westy XII. A small dose of heat from the alcohol. Not much from any esters but some great molasses notes.
Mouthfeel: Less carbonated than the Westy XII but with a thicker mouthfeel. Spreads nicely across the palate. 
Overall: Very good. Almost feels fuller and more substandcial than the westy and La trappe. Very well refined. After a while the sugar makes it a little decadent. Better than the Westy in the initial flavor but a I could drink more westy than the Rochefort 10. 866 characterscradke, Oct 10, 2012

The color is a deep, dense, hazy brown color, very dark, almost with a gray-hue as well. The nose is very reminiscent of red wine, full of dark red grapes, figs, sweet brown sugar, burnt caramel, licorice, raisins, plums - so much going on here, it's quite wonderful. The taste is full of the same, with a slight alcohol warmth, grapes, plums, sweet malts and caramel, and just a touch of floral notes in the background. Heavy mouth and extremely creamy with a nice and welcomed carbonation bite.
It's easy to see why this beer is so popular. A great quad with a huge aroma and flavor complexity, nice alcohol warmth but masked well for 11.2%, making it very easy to drink. Truly a great brew here. 822 characterstectactoe, Oct 07, 2012

Smell: The smell of this beer is definitely intriguing and complex. It is the darkest Quadrupel I've ever had. Lots of raisins, figs, and other dark fruits on the nose. It's peppery, there's clove, and there's a rum-like background. I had to spend a few moments sniffing through this and doing my best to understand it. I don't think I was entirely successful.
Taste: Frankly it's just an amazing beer and the best of the Rochefort. It's very bold and highly complex. A beer you want to take your time with and sip carefully. I'm finding dark caramel, raisins, figs, cloves, anise, molasses, plum, and rum.
Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel was thick and well carbonated (appropriately so).
Overall: This is an absolutely outstanding beer that everyone should try at some point. I'm looking forward to future bottles and am happy to have a few in storage now. 988 charactersSpasticKoala, Oct 07, 2012

There's some bubbly carbonation but its much smoother than the 8 (although the alcohol birn kind of negates that). This is supposed to be one of the best beers available (all the trappist ales are). And its damn good. These monks know what they're doing. Rochefort 8 is next (higher rated everywhere than the 10). 594 charactersDonDirkA, Oct 06, 2012

A - Pours a dark brown with about a finger of tan head with good retention and some mild lacing. 
S - Dark fruits - raisins, plums. Perhaps a hint of caramel.
T - A lot going on here. starts out with some sweetness on the tongue. Middle of the tongue picks up those fruits that we smelled earlier. Also picks up some breadiness towards the back. Finishes super clean. Even as it warms there's very little alcohol, but you can still feel some warmth. 
M - Damn near perfect. Medium to heavy. Did I already mention that it's almost perfect? So smooth.
O - This is a must try. So smooth with such a complex flavor profile. And 11%?! Get a bottle. Or two. 718 charactersmikeburd1128, Oct 03, 2012

A - Pours a dark brown auburn color. The head rises above the glass, several fingers in altitude. Dark sediment form the bottom of the bottle stays suspended atop the mound of carbonation. Good retention with visibly aggressive carbonation.
S - Smells of cherry, raisins, nutmeg, and booze. Belgian yeast and candied malt pair nicely with mellow vanilla.
T - Nice bready malt up front followed by rich dark fruits. Some banana-clove belgian flavors mid-pallate. Very little alcohol heat with a nice vanilla finish. Excellent.
M - Not very thick, but not thin either. Smooth carbonation.
O - Quads aren't really my thing, but this is probably a top 5 Quad for me (in my limited experience). Smooth in feel and flavor. Coats the tongue and leaves a pleasant aftertaste. With two years of age, it is mellow and complex. An easy to get, good quad that I highly recommend if you enjoy the style. 966 charactersNoLeafClover44, Oct 03, 2012

Silky smooth in the mouth. Raisins, figs, plums, nuts, brown sugar, caramel. Deceptively smooth. A real treat.

A - Black, with a slightly brown hue. Big multi-finger tan head. Retention was nice, yet lacing was not perfect.
S - Lots of fruit here. Complexity making its mark! I detect apples, pears, grape and fig. Good stuff.
T - So very much balanced complexity. Figs, cherry, chocolate, brown sugar, caramel and a bit of dryness to finish.
M - Smooth, full body with nice carbonation that settles with the beer, furthering the exquisite balance that I cannot completely absorb.
O - I have had this beer periodically over the past few years and I can say that it gets better each time. Initially I thought this was just too much for me, furthering I found it excellent and now I find this to be one of the best Quad's available. The ABV presence warms the beer, rather than making it unbearable. Shockingly, this is drinkable. Had I no knowledge of the craft beer trade, I could easily put a few of these down in an evening, granted the next day may not be the best... Short of a Westy 12, this beer is bottled perfection. 1,159 charactersmscudder, Sep 23, 2012

Dark fruit and a lot of sweetness; there is dates, plum, raisins and sugar to name but a few. There is also maybe just a slight bit too strong an alcohol burn from it towards the end.
Medium bodied and very smooth indeed with medium to strong carbonation, a lot of spice and great depth with some alcohol but this is hidden well for the most part.
Almost perfect beer, if only it were ever so slightly weaker in the alcohol department it could be classed as unbeatable. It had it all, a great mix of flavours and with plenty going on and a huge alcohol content that was hidden a lot better than I would have imagined. 1,039 charactersflyingpig, Sep 22, 2012

A 330ml bottle with a BB of Aug 2015. Bought from a Belgian supermarket while on a trip in September 2010. This has since been cellared in my garage, and has hopefully matured nicely. The bottle is covered in dust and cobwebs...
Poured into a Duvel tulip. Managed to leave most of the yeast in the bottle. A deep reddish-brown hue with plentiful carbonation and chunky yeast sediment. Produces a large head of creamy tan foam that hangs around for a few minutes before slowly reducing to a surface layer. Aroma of rich, fruity malt with notes of raisins, plums, dried fruit, brown sugar, caramel and yeast esters. Sweet, vinous and slightly oxidised. A warming whiff of booze in the background; spicy and solvent-like.
Tastes of sweet, fruity malt with a boozy, lingering finish. Notes of raisins, plums, dried fruit, brown sugar, caramel, yeast esters and mild stewed hops. A vinous, wine-like quality pervades the flavour. Slightly oxidised, with hints of sherry/port. Dry, with a warm alcoholic finish that tingles on the palate. Mouthfeel is smooth, spicy and tingly, with pleasant carbonation and great body. Somewhat astringent, with an aftertaste of fruity malt and booze.
Tasty stuff - complex and well-crafted. A rich fruity character with a spicy, boozy finish. Quite sweet but balanced. The only thing that takes it down a notch is the subtle hint of oxidation in the aroma/flavour - this detracts from the overall quality of the beer. I wasn't sure how I'd compare it to other quads that I've had, but at this tasting I reckon it doesn't stand up to Westvleteren 12. I'll probably go over it again in the future, perhaps with a less aged bottle. In any case, this is still a world-class beer that everyone should try. Recommended - grab one if you can. 1,838 charactersjazzyjeff13, Sep 17, 2012

The hype was built up, so I expected great things from this beer. For me, this was a good beer, but not a great beer. I believe I am turning into a HopHead...and this beer was smooth, rich, and delicious, but it left me wanting more flavors and aromas.
Price was high, so were the reviews and my hopes. A good beer but I think I can buy two or three great beers for the same price as this one. 606 charactersPhilip61, Sep 13, 2012
4.2/5  rDev -6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4My first time with this beer, thanks to Oz for supplying it. Smell is somewhat boozy but I also get a bunch of fruit notes as well. Nice pour with a really nice head. Dark berries, grapes, dark chocolate aroma. Very nice sipper, the alcohol does not overwhelm, just a hint of burn going down, but the dark chocolate bitterness adds a nice touch at the end. A really great beer! 377 charactersiabeerbaron, Sep 13, 2012

As I pour an 11.2 oz. bottle into a pint glass, a rich and full head fills the glass.... It has a dark brown appearance.... Not quite that of a stout, but more like a Pepsi.... 
The smell is complex, yet amazing.... It has notes that are yeasty, sour, nutty, and even smells like chocolate and molasses.... 
The taste is very rich with almost the exact same notes as the nose.... A sweet and yeasty taste with hints of chocolate and grapes.... 
This brew leaves you with a very full aftertaste that's just as amazing as it lingers awhile on the palate.... A pretty strong beer that I suggest sipping so that you're able to get everything out of it.... 
This truly is a great representation of a real Belgian Ale (which are easily the best in the world).... I will surely be enjoying another one of these well crafted brews again.... You can pick it up in single bottles at a Whole Foods for only $6.99.... Well worth it. 996 charactersDannyHartman, Sep 12, 2012

Smell isn't very complex. Kind of muddled and tough to pick out characteristics. Some fruit, almost grapey with a touch of pepper. 
Mouth is in typical quad fashion with high carb and light bodied. 
Overall it's good and a solid representation of the style. Haven't had one in a while and will probably go a while before another. 437 charactersMrVonzipper, Sep 11, 2012

S: Sour, funky, and yeasty, molasses, and rich, roasted nuts. Light cocoa in the fashion of Nutella. 
T: Probably the most up front and flavorful beer I've ever come across. Very rich, sugar cane sweetness, clove, nutmeg. Dessert-like breads. Strong punch of hops and alcohol at the end. Most definitely a quad. Some raisin and prune. There is something in there though, that just doesn't sit right with me, a weird flavor at the very end that's kind of like artificial milk chocolate.
M: Very fitting of the beer, it's high in carbonation, big, and full. Hearty and spicy. Hangs around on the palate just long enough to let you absorb the experience.
O: This is wonderful. Very strong though, so it would be a bad idea to drink many of these. I've got to get this again to see how the second tasting goes. 948 charactersJemonster, Sep 08, 2012

A: Deep chocolate, almost opaque with a light tan head that lingers for quite a while. Good carbonation.
S: Indubitably dark fruit with hints of grape. Almost a wine-like nose. Slighty spicy, yet maintaining a very fruity sweetness.
T: Intensely flavourful. Hints of chocolate, a lot of dark fruit flavours (figs, grape). A very rich body of roasted malt which gives a very wholesome sweetness to the beer. Spicier than I expected - almost peppery. Finishes incredibly sweet and earthy, with a lingering fruitiness. The alcohol is almost nonexistent until you start to feel its warmth at the back of your throat and on your face and lips, which is dangerous for an 11% abv beer.
M: A rather average mouthfeel, considering the appearance of the beer, but not in a bad way. It's very comfortable to drink, not overbearing. Very good lacing of carbonation.
O: A very good beer. Incredibly well-balanced and drinkable, even at the staggering 11% abv. My only gripe is the spiciness, which came on a bit too strongly for my liking (interestingly, the spiciness became increasingly subdued as the beer warmed). However, that's just me, and this is still a beer that everyone NEEDS to try. 1,219 charactersBS-, Sep 02, 2012

A- Absolute perfection. A creamy haze of both reddish caramel and deep amber topped with a massive head and few spots of sediments.
Smell- A lot of dark fruits. Definitely plum and cherry with maybe a hint of raisen.
Taste- Again nothing short of world class. One of the few beers that manages to balance a high alcohol concentration with the other flavors found throughout the complexities.

A: Pours a deep copper with a finger of grayish tan head. Not much lacing but very good retention; a thick ring sticks around for awhile.
S: Lots of brown sugar, plum, a little cherry, some alcohol. Nice complexity. 
T: A more subdued version of the aroma, tending more towards the fruit and malt and less brown sugar. Pretty dry, a bit boozy though not bad considering the ABV.

T: First impression is earthy (almost muddy) dates. Light alcohol present. Over time the flavor profile shifts to cherry and brown sugar.
M: High carbonation, light body, fairly dry finish. Perfect in this aspect.
O: A great beer, both as a exemplar for the style and across the full spectrum of beer. A little pricy, but well worth the splurge. 535 characterskscaldef, Aug 22, 2012

The pour is smooth with an average head and lattice. The color is an amber red, a bit darker than I had expected, actually. The smell was like the taste, balanced with nothing dominating over anything else. It has a high alcohol content (11%), so there is a trace of a kick in its taste. But like the sour fruit and caramel tastes, it is balanced in well. A solid beer that I would easily drink again and again. 519 charactersIlafan, Aug 19, 2012

It pours an attractive dark amber brown, opaque, with a fluffy beige head that settles down after several minutes.
The aroma has plenty of characteristics including dark malts, Belgian candied sugar, brown sugar, yeast, plum, bread, and an impossible to find alcohol bite considering it is over 11%.
The body is smooth and bold. 
I loved tasting this because it began with a sweet, smooth caramel malt note blended with dark fruits and then a pungent bitter bite on the tail end. This is incredibly well balanced and a joy to drink. 
I rarely give 5's to anything but this is worth it. It would be fabulous if every Quad in the world was as good. 746 characterspuboflyons, Aug 18, 2012

A - This beer has a dark caramel look to it
S - Strangely, this beer's smell reminded me of acetone. I also go fruity notes, wine-like notes, and it smelled very boosey.
T - Tastes so boosey I felt like I was drinking wine. I loved the muted sugar tones, compared to the 6 and 8. Tastes bready, fruity, caramely, like a white wine and a loaf a bread. Finished slick and smooth. Felt like it burned the back of my throat like a shot of vodka, it was great.
M - a light mouthfeel with heavier carbonation than the 6 and 8. The carbonation really hit the spot.
Overall - This beer is an absolute perfection of the 6, 8, 10 series. I was not a big fan of the sugary 6 and 8 predecessors, but this 10 really hit it on the nose. It feels boosey, but it does not feel like an 11.3. This was an amazing beer and I would recommend it to anyone. 874 charactersBeeker, Aug 13, 2012

smell: I get dark ripe fruits right away, together with caramel / brown sugar. 
taste: First sip is quite alcohol heavy, together with ripe fruits and caramel and brown sugar at the end. The next sip the alcohol starts to mellow out. I get more flavors, like dates, raisins and plum, bready, getting some full sweetness of caramel up the nose. Some medicinal / phenol stuff going on as well. Got some peppery spice with alcohol. Mainly the brown sugar with (quite heavy) alcohol taste remains as a finish. 
mouthfeel: Medium thick and quite some carbonation. Alcohol as a spicy kick.
overall: I do like the flavor profile. The only thing is that the alcohol taste is just too heavy and ruins the bear imo. Maybe it's the phenol with alcohol combo that turns me down. I know better beers with a similar flavor profile. This one just didn't really work for me. 920 charactersArno, Aug 07, 2012

A- Pours a very dark woody brown,amber. A massive three finger off tan head. Very nice lacing and impressive alcohol legs. Lots of particles after the swirl. 
S- The first thing I get is dark fruits. A lot of caramel coated raisins, plums and dates. A sugary sweetness to them all. There's also a slight bread note.
T- I get a slight bitterness and alcohol sting up front. Followed up by a smooth array of breaddy notes, dark caramel and toffee. The back end of this beer is all dark fruits, There is raisins, plums, figs and dates. Finish is all dark fruit and it sticks around
M- This is a big beer that is very well balanced out by enormous amounts of alcohol and carbonation. Surprisngly easy to drink for its size. Goes down with high carbonation and a velvety feel. 
O- Awesome Quad and it certainly lives up to its reputation. I cant say I like it as much as St. Bernardus Abt 12, it is very close and certainly a worthy adversary spite the two beers being so different. Get it. 1,030 charactersTwelveOunces, Aug 01, 2012

I poured this into a chalice and got about two fingers of foam. I picked-up a decent amount of dark fruit and some light sour off the top.
This is a very good example of a quad. I like the balance of ale presence and dark fruits. It wasn't too heavy or strong. I like the balance.
The Rochefort 10 is a pretty easy to get beer. I recommend picking up a couple bottles. Drink one and cellar the bottle. This beer tastes like it is good for aging. 578 charactersummswimmin, Jul 29, 2012

S- light candied plum, light pear, really sweet smelling like a liqueur of some sort of dark skinned fruit, and a light brown sugar back-note. 
T- malt bill is sturdy. tastes of malt syrup even: strong, rich, sweet, numbing in its intensity. plum is back in, as is the brown sugar, and some earth, like dirt wood, finishes it out. so beautiful and interesting. alcohol is slighy in balance by the strong flavors.
M- soft. very delicate for something technically this big. though the flavors are bold, she drinks really softly. little numbing tinge, but at 11.3, this is expected, right?
so damn good. so
good. so astonishingly available that i slap myself everytime i have this for not having a case to develop. 957 characterspatm1986, Jul 29, 2012
4.61/5  rDev +3.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from bottle into Founders snifter. Serious fizzy two-fingered light tan head. Dissipates to thin layer, retention is minimal but does climb and recede every sip. Blend of dark fruit coloring, I'd say raisin, raspberry, strawberry and cherry, and grape. Smell is light and of dark fruit aromas. I generally do not like dark fruit-based beers, like ommegang's three philosophers, but this is much different. Smell is crisp and sharp. Taste is otherworldly -- nectar, grape juice, unreal. Nutty presence, but not overwhelming. Mouthfeel is smooth and dry, aftertaste is a bit bubbly, like a champagne, but much less biting. This beer is awesome, prob #2 on my list of Trappispte beers. 689 charactersrodlavers, Jul 28, 2012

The appearance is dark with a reddish frame. The head is thin but the brew is robust with carbonation not flat like a lot of darker brews. 
The smell is earthy and hoppy with a twinge of alchohol. 
This beer tastes great! You can taste chocolate and caramel. 
Mouthfeel is bubbly. 
Love this beer just wish it was not so darn expensive at $7.50 per 12 oz bottle. 424 charactersccherry24, Jul 27, 2012

On this particular night, I opened up Westvleteren 12 from 2007 alongside a Rochefort 10 2006 with my good friend Greg (BeerListMan) in Chicago. 
Westvleteren 12 and Rochefort 10 aged are both super complex, but the Westvleteren 12 won due to it's smooth drinkability. There was absolutely no trace of alcohol and everything was so well balanced in the drink. Rochefort 10 still had some 'power' in it and it was extremely tasty and drinkable but the flavors were a little bit more unbalanced. The date, raisin, plum flavors in the Westvleteren 12 were more pronounced while I tasted more bready characteristics (almost like drinking rye) in the Rochefort. 
The only difference is that I enjoyed the heavier, syrupy mouthfeel of the Rochefort 10 over the slightly lighter bodied Westvleteren 12. 
A good way to describe this would be to drink a Highland Park 18 year scotch alongside a similar type of scotch with 15 years.. The 18 year will rock your world due to its drinkability and smoothness and the Westvleteren 12 did the same thing against the Rochefort 10. That being said, I would still age my Rochefort 10s because of its availability in the US. 1,244 charactersChicagoJohn, Jul 25, 2012

A- Near black in colour, but you still can definitely notice that there's some murkyness about it. Some reddish hints showing up if seen through light. Quite big, dense off-white head that shows great retention throughout the last sips, while still leaving some nice amounts of lacing
S- Pretty strong on the yeast side, with some kind of a sweet, sugary, earthy feel. Dark bready malts, slight roasted hint. Pretty strong dark fruit notes showing up. Also has a slight barleywine-like feel: delicate, warming booze; liqueur-like chocolate and liquorice notes. Great, and amazingly persistent
T- Strong malty character, a slight roasted hint along with notes of bark bread, caramel, maybe chocolate. Caramel is sure the most distinct note, with sugary sweetness probably having a role in this. Indeed, the beer also has a pretty strong, yeasty-earthy feel, that always remains on the sweet side. A slight, fresh herbal feel brings balance to an otherwise cloyingly sweet feel, as well as a slight hint of refreshing bitterness in the aftertaste. Lots of dark fruit notes on the back of things, as to be expected: berries, raisin, plum. Maybe some hints of liquorice too. And is what is most amazing, all perfectly balanced
M- Pretty dense in body, but still nicely smooth on both tongue and palate, with just the right amount of carbonation to bring a bit of life. Flavours are able to fully spreads on your mouth for seconds. Still remains a bit heavy on the stomach, but that is almost impossible to avoid in a dark, 11.3%ABV beer
O- Liked Rochefort 8 a bit more. Rochefort 10 may have a slightly bolder feel in terms of flavours, but the 8 still presents the same amazing complexity and subtlety, while providing even more balance and drinkabilty. Not that i mean to say that this one is not nicely drinkable or balanced, just that the 8 is even better than this one awesome beer 1,962 charactersCozzatoad, Jul 25, 2012
4.06/5  rDev -9.2%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Pours a very dark, murky brown color. 3 finger tan head and lots of foam rise up. Head retention and lacing are extremely good, especially for such a high alcohol beer.
Smell is heavy on candied belgian rock sugar. Sweet molasses, burnt biscuit, and roasted malt are also present. Hops arent present but a distinct high abv beer booze aroma is. 
Taste is big on astringent alcohol, balanced by sweet candied sugar and syrupy burnt malts. A strong,smoky, dry scotch-like flavor which is uncommon for the style is dominant. 
Mouthfeel is medium bodied and well carbonated. Head contributed a smooth creaminess to beer. Finish was semi dry and astringent. 
Overall this beer was good but a bit too heavy on the booze side. Strong, malt forward flavors make this a complex beer, but I think it needs to age acouple more years before its at its prime drinking state. 865 charactersangelmonster, Jul 25, 2012
4.97/5  rDev +11.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured from a bottle into a Westvleteren goblet.
A - Dark brownish-purple with a bit of off-white head from a fairly vigorous pour. Small head but decent lacing. Looks very inviting.
S - This beer smells better than 95% of other beers taste. Seriously. Deep, dark raisin, fig, plum, caramel, candi syrup, and red wine grapes. The nose on this stuff is truly remarkable - so much so, that I find myself taking 2 deep inhales before most sips. 
T - Follows the nose, more or less, with the caramel/candi/dark fruit flavors lingering on the tongue in the most delightful way possible. The finish is like a fine wine, but even smoother. It's worth waiting a couple of minutes between sips just to savor this one. After the incomparable smell, the taste delivers in spades. Alcohol is in the background for maybe the first sip, but this beer is so well balanced, that it's pleasant for the few sips where it's even noticable.
M - Syrupy, but the right amount - enough to coat the tongue in order to deliver all the flavor and balance the alcohol, but not too much to be cloying. Carbonation is low, but that's right on for the style.
O - This is the best beer in the world. It easily outclasses every barrel-aged stout, Double/Triple IPA, Belgian quad, and other beer I've tried, and I've tried just about all of the best. Nothing really even comes close to delivering the experience from pour, to 5 minutes after the last sip like Rochefort 10. Westy 12 is pretty close, but I think Rochefort 10 suffers in its rankings from being widely available in the States if you're willing to pay for it, because it's better than even Westy 12 in my opinion. This beer is an experience like no other - fresh, aged, it doesn't matter, you won't find a better beer anywhere. Find it, buy it, horde it, and drink one whenever you feel like drinking the best beer ever made. 1,861 characterskdb150, Jul 24, 2012

Smell is lots of dark fruit. Some prunes, raisins, maybe a bit of dark cherry or plum. Some oak. Bit of alcohol, maybe a slight tobacco smell? Smells good. 
Taste has lots of dark fruit, a hint of chocolate, some oak, maybe a bit of caramel. Nice alcohol warmth, but never hot. Slight hint of bitterness as it hits the tongue. Very tasty.
Mouthfeel is really well carbonated, but a little thin. 
Very tasty, and very drinkable as long as you don't let it get too warm. Glad this is so easy to get. 663 charactersrodkin, Jul 23, 2012

A: Looks great. Pours a deep dark chocolate color with a thin, cream-colored head. Little carbonation to be seen.
S: Very complex mixture of smells: Mainly molasses and fruit with a very minor note of booziness.
T: Taste is very smooth. Complex array of detected flavors include raisins, caramel, and molasses. Small "twangs" of booziness during the first few sips.
M: Very full-bodied beer that feels good on the palate. Not too light, not too heavy.
O: Overall, I enjoyed the beer a lot. Very rich, complex beer that has a lot to offer. Only thing that I found off-putting was the slight notes of booziness in the first few drinks but then again, it is a Belgian Quad and I was no longer picking up on them halfway through enjoying the beer. 916 charactersRootimus88, Jul 15, 2012

A - opaque garnet brown with a 2 finger tan head with good head retention and bubbly moderate lacing

T - Sweet molasses malt impress first accompanied with warming alcohol and climaxing dark fruits raisins, dates, candies, and a touch of biscuit.
M - medium body, moderate to low carbonation. Chewy with a lot of alcohol warming
O - I have had this several times with varying levels of success. This bottle offered more etoh and less dark fruits than the last but still a very nice beer. I'd drink this on most cold days. 662 characterswilliamjbauer, Jul 15, 2012

Got this as a father's day/birthday gift from my son!
Pours a dark brown, opaque color. The tan head starts at 2 fingers and sticks around nicely, with a fair amount of lacing.
Aromas are very rich and complex, with ripened fruit notes, molasses, oak wood, alcohol and vanillas. A real delight for the nose.
The taste is dominated by a strong malt character, with caramelized brown sugar, dark breads, toasted grains and a bitterness of dark chocolate. A nice warmth of alcohol is also in the background of flavors. 
The body is thick, with a high amount of carbonation. The finish is of caramels and chocolates; moderately sweet.
I found this to be a delightful strong sipping beer -- perfect for a nightcap. 850 characterssommersb, Jul 07, 2012

Light brown head composed of tiny bubbles. Cloudy orange ruby colored body. Head both holds and laces the glass well. 
Awesome smell, which is usually my gripe with Quads. Berries and raisins. Caramel, and some slight booze. All characteristics fairly subtle and enticing. 
Yeast is quite flavorful- puts off fruit and musk character. Ultra warming to the esophagus. Aftertaste of dark sugar and dried fruits. Bitterness is strong and well suiting. Overall hop presence is minimal. Almost has a herbal or root flavor. Very Earthy.
Surprisingly thick mouthfeel on such a booze filled beer. Mouthfeel is perceived as being very alcoholic, but still very drinkable, dangerously drinkable. 
At first it was almost too much and I wasn't sure I liked it. But as I sipped on I found myself enjoying the huge variety of flavors I was pulling out. My palate eventually adjusted to the complexity and intensity. 
Superb example of a Belgian Quad. 1,007 charactersmlazzaro, Jul 03, 2012

There are sediments at the bottom of the bottle, which I always pour into the glass, since I found that, if anything, they add a bit more spiciness to the drink. 
The smell is amazing, with caramel and raspberries blending in with the more subtle raisin smell. Tastes like raspberries, raisins, with a malty sweetness and a hint of spiciness from the alcohol along with a very pleasant and subtle belgian yiest sourness. Of medium body and carbonation, this is a very easy to drink beer, the only trap being the alcohol concentration. 631 charactersMarius, Jul 01, 2012

Emptied (minus the decanted waste) the bottle into the goblet so gently and sacrificed the head... damn. The sliver there was has fallen and is now not. Deep purple-brown in color with some translucency.
Cocoa powder, plum, fig, medicinal phenols, bing cherry pits, orange pulp, light booze, pie crust, toffee, and pinot. One of the most complex noses on a beer that you will ever come across.
Figgy and roasty with delightful dark fruit notes of grape, black cherry, plum, candied orange, and nectarine. Malty and rich with fanciful swatches of dusted cocoa, pumpernickel, and oozey pecan pie filling. Rusty booze prickles the tongue. A far-from-balancing, but appreciated, dose of bitterness in the middle-to-end with a faint kiss of hops. Medicinal flavors shadowingly twist and contort into a more herbal finish. Godly good.
Medium-to-full body with a lot of carbonation. Booze is right where it should be for a royal sipper. Lively action on the tongue and warming comfort in the gut.
The 'War and Peace' of beers. A quad that only has competitors; which is to say, Rochefort 10 is in the upper-eschelon of all beers. Looking back on eight years of enjoying great beer, this was definitely my first quad and one of my first loves. I, and probably you as well, do NOT buy this beer enough, or as often. Overall, perfect.
***
Rochefort 10. Best by April 14, 2015. 2010 vintage. Poured into its Rochefort goblet.
Nice hiss crack. Pours a burgundy color with dark red hues in the light. The head remained somewhat diminutive to what I normally remember, but it still crowned for minutes before reducing to a thick ring and a large organic foam island on the surface. 4
Hugely vinous aroma with rich raisin and dried date notes. The usual semi-bitter clove phenols have been tamed. Mega fruitiness with a Merlot grape, prune, and plum intensity. Still has that brown bread maltiness, but somewhat sweetened and caramelized. 4.75
Amazing four-year Rochefort quad. Rich, stewed grape, winey flavors with dark bready malts, transformed candi sugar, plum, prune, raisin, red grape, and a mild phenolic note. Mildly tannic with the only bitterness that's left behind. Aged gracefully well. Superb. Out of this world. So rich and full. The body is a soupy dream. Mega full with that sparse carbonated chew diffused within. 4.75, 4.75, 4.75 2,360 charactersthecheapies, Jun 26, 2012
4.12/5  rDev -7.8%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25A - 3.5 Tons of fizz. Mostly fizz initially. Somewhat soapy looking light tan head that dissipates to nothing in a couple of minutes. Dark brown beer that looks like apple cider when a light is shined through it. Not a particularly attractive beer.
S - 4.0 - Light vaguely grapey fruit smell with bready smell. Really nice. Can't quite place the rest of it. Almost an apple cider component but not quite.
T - 4.25 - Robust flavor with a dense richness to the flavor without the liquid itself being dense. Reminds me of how a pan sauce gets that concentrated flavor, or stock made from bones that have been first browned - not those flavors, just the same concentratedness. A hint of brown sugar sweetness on the exhale. A bit of the bread from the nose. A hint of chocolate, but not quite. The only way I notice the booze is in how my face quickly got warm.
M - 4.0 - Thinner and lighter than expected. Well carbonated. Finishes moderately dry.
O - 4.25 - Very good. I was actually hoping for something with a bigger, thicker presence, but like with the St. Bernardus was surprised to find it fairly light. I almost want it boiled down a bit so the same flavors are there in richer form. What I like about it is the subtlety of the flavors. I like when fine cuisine does this - it gives you a flavor at about 95% of the level you'd need to recognize it, which forces you to chase it and keep wondering quite what it is. For a beer some call the best in the world, I'd like to see something more. I've been saving my 5's all this time for something like this! Now what do I do? Go back and recalibrate everything? Only Westvleteren 12 remains amongst the big Belgians to claim that prize. 1,691 charactersBrownNut, Jun 25, 2012

A: Pours a dark hazy burnt orange / brown with a fizzy 2 finger off white head thats is quick to dissipate to a thin covering. Sediment is visible floating in the glass. No lacing.
S: Heavy fruits on the nose reminds me of a dark wine. Even though its far from the smell of most beers it just smells right. Raisin, plum, fig, hints of apple all present. 
T: Great balanced taste of sweetness and fruit. Not as easily explained as other beers as it is very complex. All the fruits in the nose are present in flavor as well. I really enjoy the sweet maltiness this brings to the table.
M: Mild and smooth body with tons of carbonation. Booze is very well hidden. Even with how drinkable this is, it is still a sipper. Real nice and warming.
Overall a phenomenal beer that everyone needs to try. I've had some amazing beers and cannot do this beer justice in a simple review. 931 charactersCloudStrife, Jun 25, 2012

Taste: A rich malt profile, with a lot of caramel malts - a bit grainy, a bit biscuity - quite Belgian, with some banana, clove, phenolic flavors, and spices - lots of dark fruits, including raisins and figs, and some non-specific dark fruit skin - lots of booze, but it works with the other flavors
Mouthfeel: On the heavy side of medium, very smooth, with some lingering booze
Overall: Very tasty, but not the best
Yes, I'm spoiled. I drank a Westy 12 relatively recently. And for my palate, this is not as good. Granted, this is probably not a fair comparison. Rochefort 10 is great quad, however. A little boozy, but a fantastic supper... I mean sipper. 1,030 charactersangrybabboon, Jun 23, 2012
4.18/5  rDev -6.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to angrybabboon for sharing the bottle.
Appearance: Dark brown with some ruby edges. Hazed. Head is a light khaki and drops to a spotty cap and fluffy collar. Thin head. Ruddy.
Smell: Balsamic vinegar and dark ripe fruit. Fig and cherry. Lingering sweetness. Belgian yeast adds a nice layer of clove and super ripe banana. Some woody, earthy elements. Great depth. Big caramel sweetness pushes toward molasses. Rich toffee. Edge of booze. 
Taste: Fruit and just the lightest edge of aged balsamic vinegar. Candi sweetness runs the gamut from caramel up through brown sugar. Ums, figs and dark cherries. Loads of fruit. Sharp alcohol bite layered over some bready, as in rich brown bread, notes. Yeast is heavy on the banana. Light clove notes. Nice house yeast. Great depth.
Mouthfeel: Medium body with a lively for the style carbonation. A touch dry on the back from the alcohol. Creamy.
Overall: Very well rounded with a great depth. It might need a little time to mellow out, but it's got all the right flavor in all the right places. A little less complex than Westy 12, but it's in that rarified air for the style. 1,131 charactersGoblinmunkey7, Jun 23, 2012

Sweet and dark malts, a little beady, not as much alc as I got in the 8 
It's bready, almost has a sour kick at the end you can tell its 11+% but the alc is by no means overpowering its kinda sweet when it first hits the pallet

5/5  rDev +11.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured a beautiful reddish-brown, with a finger of gorgeous off-white head. Spectacular. Scents of dark fruit, raisin, some dried apple and slight alcohol when cold. Fruity scents and brown sugar take over the aroma as the beer warms. The apple is also still present. There is also some slight spice aromas, almost cinnamon-like. An excellent, complex nose that evolves as the beer warms. Flavors of raisin, brown sugar, dark fruit, apples, chocolate, and slight alcohol when cold. As the beer warms the alcohol becomes more pronounced on the finish and the other flavors also become more intense. The fruity flavors in particular become stronger and more assertive. A slight red wine character also begins to emerge. A sublime, complex flavor profile. Fantastic. Mouthfeel is heavy bodied with a slight alcohol burn. Quite good, nice to sip. This is an excellent beer, deep, complex and rich. Well worth drinking, well worth savoring. It is simply sublime. 957 charactersAuraan, Jun 16, 2012

appearance: all of the rocheforts have fantastic pours - the 10 is dark mahogany with a nice creamy tan head
smell: rich, chocolate, dark fruit, toffee
taste: Rochefort 10 is undoubtedly a classic - a quad where everything to be said has already been said. Layers of dark fruit - plum, cherry, vinous grape, chocolate, brown sugar, yeast, warming alcohol, sweet raisin bread. Delightful.

4.62/5  rDev +3.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 33cl bottle into an oversized brandy snifter.
Pours a very dark, purple, brownish color with a hazy like almost soapy texture to it. The head is off white, very pronounced with at least a 4 finger fluffy head that dissipates to a film barely holding on with each replenishing carbonation bubble streaming from the bottom. Huge aromas of raisins, brown sugar, almost a caramelized walnut aroma. Deep cedar notes followed by a nutty sweetness . There is also a vinous character to this that reminds me of inky red wines like shiraz and barolo. Deep dark stone fruits come just after the sweetness and lend itself to a nice warming alcohol note that lets you know this is a big beer. Taste is very complex starting with a big raisin and tobacco note that leave both sweet and earth flavors on the palate. Dry finish but before the finish there is a big kick of prune sweetness and just a touch of cocoa that leaves a bitter note that is quite nice. Dryness overwhelmed the palate on the finish, suggesting another sip. The body is actually medium to heavy bodied, even with the alcohol presence. Warming alcohol burn in a nice way gives this beer a distinct vinous quality as mentioned before. Overall, probably the best quad i have had so far. I never knew what "extremely complex" meant but after having this and seeing the flavors develop each second after the sip, i now know what that means. I have 2 bottles of west 12 to try still so maybe that will be better than this. Definitely more complex that Chimay Blue, but equally as drinkable. Very easy to access, and often passed by but you should really try this with a beef roast or a stew. Perfect night beer. 1,678 charactersAugustiner719, Jun 08, 2012

The aroma is full of alcohol and dark fruits, mainly rainsins and plums. Also some sweet fumes make their way through, must be figs. 
The taste doesn't hit the palate as hard as I expected from the nose. Super delish! The flavors ease their way in, starting with sweet plums and some licorice. Then comes a wave of sweetness in the form of figs and nutmeg. Very rich and chewy. There really isn't any bitterness present at all. The finish is sticky, but isn't cloying....very smooth. 
The alcohol is present only in warmth, doesn't contribute to the flavor but adds a comforting warmth to the beer, like sitting next to a warm fire. At 11.3%ABV - HOT DAMN!

S. Freshly baked bread, slightly toasted bread crust, apple and pear skin, grape essence, caramelized brown sugar, some raisin, and fig. The bouquet on this is impeccably integrated and beautifully rounded. Absolute perfection.
T. Lots of caramel, toasted biscuit, raisin, subtle chocolate, apple, fresh cherry juice, tea leaf, and grains. Slightly boozy on the finish.
M. Full bodied, creamy, luscious. Light carbonation provides just enough punch to offset what is otherwise a thick, frothy brew. Alcohol is very well-hidden for the ABV.
O. I've heard it said that this is as close to Westy 12 as it comes and I have to agree. I'm not sure I could tell the difference between the two if you put them both down in front of me, and I'm not sure I'd Westy 12 would be the winner. This is a fantastic quad: it doesn't break new ground, but it is absolute aces as far as the style goes. Complex and savory, Rochefort 10 sets the standard for Belgian Quads and is absolutely a must try. Cheers. 1,169 characterssiege06nd, Jun 05, 2012

Thanks to my brother in law for this one
App- A good deep color of purple and plum. A ruddy mix of browns and reds mixed in. Small impish 1 finger fast receding head with no cling. No cling. Small bubbles.
Smell- Really the essence of quads. A big mix of yeast, dark fruits, caramel and some creamy earthiness.
Taste- Its a big beer but feels scalled back. A large amount of dark fruits are the first flavors to come out. A yeasty backing note comes next with some earthy malts. Close to being top Quad. But not yet.
Mouth- A full medium with a low/medium carbonation. Residual small yeast and dark fruits.
Drink- I remember this being so much more. It was fuller and I used to say Westy is over priced compred to Roch 10. I was wrong. This is a clear # 2 803 charactersFosterJM, Jun 02, 2012

Sweet on the nose, with hints of fig and brown sugar.
Malty sweet on the tongue, with the warm and fuzzy alcohol kicking in the backround. Caramel malts dominating, crisp and a bit tart, with very little hop bitterness as it is expected for the style. Flavors come out even stronger as the beer warms up. Extremely drinkable, even with the high 11.3% ABV!

Taste - Like smell but stronger..the high abv is barely noticeable. Figs, chocolate, raisins, bread. Absolutely delicious. It is a bit much, strong flavors and alchohol, although the alchohol is well masked, it does still tend to have a kick, unlike the 8. Mouthfeel - Chewy, heavy...not too carbonated though. Almost winelike at the same time. Overall - My second favorite beer (next to the 8). Expensive, but an experience that any beer lover should try. 702 charactersBrewHawkeye, May 27, 2012

M: Medium to heavy bodied, slightly syrupy, with medium level of carbonation. 
O: This is the best quad I've had to date. It reminds me of sipping a brandy, but is less sweet, more carbonated and caramelized. It would pair equally well with dessert, such as cheesecake, or dried fruits and cheese. 689 charactersFondueVoodoo, May 19, 2012

Pours dark brown liquid with very large head. The head is light brown and thickened. 
Smelled of chocolate, banana, darker malts, maybe some raison. Somewhat powerful.
Taste was VERY flavorful....Definitely chocolate/banana, although the raison was part of the smell, it was not part of the taste. The sweet finish reminded me of a dark chocolate covered cherrym and some sour apple. I didn't taste the alcohol at all.
Mouthfeel...well, definitely carbonated, but other than that very smooth. The alcohol is not as present compared to Trappist 8 (in my opinion)
Overall it was a very nice treat. I probably will not purchase again due to cost, but I'm glad I got it. I would consider it an after dinner desert drink. 808 charactersrighthereisay, May 19, 2012

It's a bit unfair to compare the other quads because I just had a 2006 bottle from Kulminator. Aging this beer only makes it better. The little bit of heat felt with a fresh bottle changes and all the sweet malt, toffee, caramel notes come out much more prominently. Wish I had it in me to drink another in one session but might be a bit too indulgent. Can't wait to drink another bottle soon. 532 charactersrdespain, May 15, 2012

The beer pours a wonderful thick burgundy color, hues of dark browns but also ruby red when placed near the light. The head on this beer is insane, sits about a finger high but sticks around indefinitely and leaves behind some amazing lacing as well. The aromas are amazing, lots of the famed Belgian yeast, cloves, toffee, a bit of caramel, brown sugar, and finished with a big kick of dark fruits, fig, dates, plums and even a bit of cherry. The alcohol is definitely prevalent in the nose, but it doesn't detract from the beer, even with the heavily sweet aromas. The flavors follow suit very well and are just as complex, the yeast again kicks off the flavors, mild clove, some banana, candied sugar, lots of spice, perhaps cinnamon or allspice, some nutmeg flavors are notable as well. Dark fruits again take over the finish on this beer, plum and prune are big elements, hints of dates play with the spices and yeast so well and are balanced with some rich toffee, caramel and nougat flavors with faint alcohol at the end. The body is so rich and full, coats the mouth so well, goes down so smoothly, about as perfect as it gets.
Verdict: One of the classic quads, I like the Westvleteren 12 a bit better, but for a beer I can walk to the store any day of the week and grab for a great price, this can't be beaten. The flavors are wonderfully complex, each sip yields something new and the smoothness is just delightful, if you haven't had it yet, you are missing out! 1,500 characterskevanb, May 15, 2012

4.92/5  rDev +10.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Poured from 11.2 oz bottle into a stemmed goblet glass.
Appearance: Pours a very deep and dark brown with some hints of amber and ruby red. Moderate amount of bubbles and a little bit of sediment. About two fingers of off white head which slowly recede to a thin creamy layer. Decent lacing on the glass.
Smell: A fairly sweet and robust smelling beer. Belgian yeast and clove with sweet caramel malts. Good hints of toffee, brown sugar, and some candied sugar. Big smell of dark fruits with good hints of rum soaked raisins, prunes, figs, dates, and grapes. Also some subtle hints of cinnamon, allspice, and coriander. Even a little chocolate and anise. A very complex aroma. 
Taste: Tastes as complex and good as it smells. Belgian yeast and cloves along with some hints of cinnamon, allspice, coriander, and anise to add to the overall spice. Nice robust malt taste with notes of caramel, toffee, and a little hint of chocolate. Some brown sugar and candied sugar add to the sweetness. Big taste of complex dark fruits. Notes of raisins, figs, prunes, dates, and grapes. Dark fruits become more vibrant as the beer warms. A really great taste. 
Mouthfeel: Medium to heavy body with a moderate level of carbonation. Very creamy. Nicely juicy and spicy. Somewhat prickly. Very drying in the mouth. Alcohol is noticeable but things still feel very smooth. 
Overall: A truly world class authentic Belgian Quad. Great mix of fruits and spices. One of the best beers in the world. 1,482 charactersMattyG85, May 13, 2012

pours a murky, deep mahogany tone; finger, finger and a half of creamy beige/off-white head with solid retention and nice walls of lacing; fair amount of sediment.
the nose is a big, rich bouquet of raisins, figs, belgian yeasts, caramel malts, brown sugar, and booze. smells deliciously complex.
more of the same pull through in the taste; a nice and very tasty balance between the dark fruits, caramel sweetness, belgian yeast, spices, and warming alcohol which ensues - relatively well hidden considering north of 11% ABV... as the beer warms, the flavors really emerge. utterly delicious.
i'd put the moutfeel at little above medium-bodied; a bit of chew to it, creamy with average carbonation and dangerously drinkable.
IMO, in the final analysis this is simply a world class beer. when i first began drinking quads i started on this guy, and then worked my way around a fair bit (westvleteren 12 still to go), sampling some great beer, but in the end nothing has come close. every time i return to rochefort 10 i'm reminded why it stands alone - hype or no, this is probably my favorite beer of all time. well done, monks of the brasserie de rochefort. well done.

Head lingered for a minute and faded. Champagne like bubble continued to precipitate form the bottom of the glass. Visible haze present.
(S) - Sweet, deep dark fruit, slight alcohol aroma. Made my mouth water in anticipation.
(T) - Prune, fig, blackberry, blueberry mixed into one. Syrupy brown sugar and a slight spice of some sort. Small after taste of dark grapes lingers as the alcohol hits the nose.
(M) - Medium full body. Creamy over the tongue transitioning to highly carbonated, finishing with a smooth alcohol.
(O) - Overall a very complex and delicious Belgian beer. Pricey but worth a try. 709 charactersLeever, May 05, 2012

S-Aroma is distinctly wine-like revealing a complexity of fruits; possible plums, and raisins, and definite hints of alcohol lift in the nose. 
T-A plethora of delicious flavors immediately overwhelming; dark fruits as mentioned, molasses, toffee, and oak. New flavors with each sip as the beer starts to warm. Alcohol is very subtle, not overwhelming at 11.3%, but feels natural and warming like fine wine.
M-A silky mouth feel with a dry finish; rich, elegant, and full of depth. 
O-Obvious as to why this is highly regarded as one of the best beers in the world! 758 charactersmtbdonn, May 04, 2012

This quad smells of dark fruit, raisins, soaked in alcohol and brown sugar.
Fruity, that same dark fruit, and sweet. So, so smooth, with the alcohol completely unnoticeable. Finishes with figs over malt.
One of the best beer I've ever had. The beer is so smooth, drinkable, complex, and delicious.

A: The beer is a very dark color. It looks black with deep purple intertwined with it. It looks like a luscious extremely flavorful grape drink. The head died extremely fast. 
S: The smell is very sweet. Raisins and figs, brown sugar, alcohol, and a hint of cloves and allspice are all present in the nose. 
T: The taste is just wonderful. It is spicy, sweet (with the fruit flavors mimicking the aroma), and you can taste the alcohol, but not in a bad way at all. The beer is warming and extremely enjoyable.
MF: A lot of these Belgian ales have slightly high and stinging carbonation. This one portrays that to some extent, and I don't enjoy that, but it is how the style usually is so it's quite accurate. 
O: My first encounter with this one. I love Belgian ales and all of the Trappist brews I have had, but watch out St. Bernardus 12, this has taken over. I think this is the best one I've had yet. Just wonderful. Too bad it's damn expensive. 988 charactersjifigz, Apr 23, 2012

N: alcohol, dark fruits (figs), chocolate, sweetness, notes of cinnamon, some leather, raisin, very very mild soy sauce notes, brown sugar on the nose
T: Super complex - rapidly changing and hard to identify flavors. Definitely some chocolate and dark figs, vinous juiciness, sharp alcoholic and CO2 bite, has some notes of porto and whisky, tastes like coca cola to, some notes of raisin, its drinks smooth with a sharp alcoholic twang/bite at the finish. After taste of coca cola, receding bitterness on the tongue. After taste some umami, soy sauce flavor (especially with the addition of the yeast)
Not blown away by this beer in terms of intensity but it is certainly very smooth for how strong it is. Very alcoholic bite and has a high complexity of flavors that change rapidly and need repeated evaluation to appropriately identify 1,028 charactersKacid, Apr 23, 2012

There is also some nice lacing, but the head retention is well impressive! Looks like a perfect quad!
S - Lots of dark, roasted malts on the nose (caramel, brown sugar, chocolate hints of licorice). Some apparent dark fruit notes, as well as a nice flowery smell to it. Some hints of alcohol. It also smells a little vinous.
T - Wow. This is pretty much a bigger, bolder version of the 8. Lots of dark fruits, brown sugar and chocolate. Some clove-like spiciness. Some mild flowery hops. Not very bitter, though quite roasty. This beer slightly reminds me of a good port wine, with that earthy/woody and vinous quality to it. The finish is long and lingering, with hints of bread, candied fruit and brown sugar.
M - Very smooth, even creamy. Medium body, medium level of carbonation, with a slight peppery quality to it. The alcohol content is fairly well-masked, even though it begins to be more noticeable as the beer warms up; but that is normal, considering it's over 11% in ABV.
O - This is a stunning quadrupel; definitely one of the best out there. I wouldn't want to drink this very often and would probably opt for other quads/Belgian Strong Dark ales (Rochefort 8, St.Bernardus Abt 12, Chimay Blue) with less ABV, but this is an amazing beer nonetheless. A true sipper. Highly recommended! 1,428 charactersNightINgale, Apr 22, 2012

These Belgium monks know how to brew! Skeptics beware, this beer will blow your mind.
Pours smooth with a silky brown/hazelnut/caramel feel into a chalice. Head brings about a smell of dark fruits with a sweet, slight sense of alcohol in the nose. Very complex.
Taste is out of this world, it took my tongue on a smooth rollercoaster, hitting it in the front with a delightfully sweet, yet earthy start into the surreptitious and complex taste of the 11.3 abv, all while maintaining world class mid tones that add the complexity you would expect from a world class quad.
I've found it best to drink at slightly under room temp...lets all of those wonderful flavors come out.
Delicious. 938 charactersrjorn1, Apr 18, 2012

Bottle is dated 090113, so I guess this makes it a little over 3 and a half years aged. Never been a fan of how this style looks so I always skew it up a little. Dark brown, sort of darker apple cider or muddy water, so it's hazy. Small off white colored head and a little bit of lacing.
Nice smelling beer, really nice. Candied and caramelized dark fruits. Particularly apples as the primary fruit, then some pears. Plenty of natural sugar aromas to accompany the fruits.
Since I don't like the look, I'm glad I like the smell and taste of this style generally. Taste picks up where the smell leaves off. Like most well done quads it has a natural sweetness. Apples, pears, raisins, and and chocolate covered cherries.
Mouthfeel is good. Full flavor with a really good carbonation level that's held up nicely. Very clean feel that I don't find characteristic of the style, you can tell it's quality. Has a very nice dry finish, sort of like a woody red wine. This beer is very drinkable too, goes pretty quick. I like this a lot, but I think I'd like to try one that's ore like a year or so on it. May edit this review upon further investigation. 1,196 charactersAndyAvalanche, Apr 16, 2012

A: Looks great - very dark brown with a foamy 2 finger head that fizzes away to a creamy film of lace. Good lacing on the glass.
S: Malty sweetness, dark fruits, hints of chocolate and bubblegum or candy, yeast. Very complex and rich and inviting.
T: Matches the smell, or betters it. I got chocolate sweetness at the front, dark fruits or cherry in the middle, hints of nice maltiness, strong taste of caramel at the back. Nice sweet aftertaste. Also, it's not that you can taste alcohol exactly, but you can feel the size of the beer on the follow. 
M: Very rich and smooth, quite creamy, full bodied for sure. Lightly fizzes on the tongue initially, and the beer produces a wonderful warming sensation that lingers. Incredible feel.
Overall: My new favourite beer, 100%. It lives up to its reputation for me, and then some. The smell and the taste are so beautifully complex that I can't wait to buy another one or two just to enjoy without reviewing. The mouthfeel too is something that's very important to me in a beer and this one is stellar. It carries the weight of the flavours and smells so well, and goes down much easier than an 11.3% ought to. I could big this one up for hours. Go try it, I strongly recommend it. 1,270 characterskillianf, Apr 12, 2012

Appearance – The beer pours a deep brown color with small hints of red within. The tan head formed upon pouring was quite abundant. It began by fading fast giving way to a head of about half a finger which lasted with some great persistence. After a long while the head faded giving way to an abundant amount of lacing.
Smell – The aroma is heavy of dark fruits; a huge cherry aroma, mixed with prune and raisin. There are also some nice yeasty aromas.
Taste – Sweet flavors for dark fruit first meet the tongue. They are of similar composition to what was detected in the nose; cherry, prune and raisin. Some yeasty flavors and malt flavors then begin to develop shortly after the initial sweet fruit flavors. These are followed by some more subtle lighter fruit tropical flavors of banana and citrus. At the very end some of the alcohol of this 11.3 % abv beer makes its presence known, and with the fruit flavors, leaves a warming sweet taste in the mouth.
Mouthfeel –The beer has a higher than average creaminess with a medium level of carbonation. The creaminess give the flavors a good chance to mingle on the tongue, but yet the carbonation matches the fruiter flavors well. While it is very good it is a little on the thin side for a beer of such strength and it makes it a bit too easy to drink.
Overall – This is a very good beer. It has wonderful dark fruit flavors and a nice warming kick. One to have every once in a while as a nice treat. 1,512 charactersDarkmagus82, Apr 11, 2012

A-wow, this is a beauty. Dark mahogany brown color with a hint of reddish highlights. Opaque. There's a lot of carbonation in that dark room of a beer that sports a modest creamy brown head and minimal lacing.
S-like freshly bake cinnamon-raisin bagel or- dare I say- home-made babka, toasted and buttered. That covers malts, sweets, breads, and fruits. There is evidence of alcohol in the aroma.
T-Wake up taste buds because here it comes: an avalanche of the above mentioned bagel and babka flavors in liquid form. Raisins, dark fruit, strong malt; alcohols galore.
M-medium feel despite the alcohol content, not heavy or thin. It is a little fizzy on the tounge as well. Not AAL fizzy, tart and lively from carbonation that dances.
O-This is a great beer to finish up the evening after taking others brews. It's a 'one and done', but the 'one' is a '10'. 921 charactersNiceTaps, Apr 09, 2012

4.47/5  rDev 0%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a bottle into a beautiful signature Trappistes Rochefort chalice. The pour is a clear, very dark mahogany color with ruby-red highlights and a thin creamy-looking head. The nose offers berries, jam, some alcohol, and that Belgian yeasty smell that reminds me of puff pastry.
Very full-bodied beer with high carbonation and a huge, robust flavor profile. It is syrupy-sweet with big fruity, bready flavors. I also get flavors of ginger and holiday spices on a nice, lingering finish. It's like liquid fruitcake. There is definitely some alcohol presence, but not enough to impart booziness. Combined with the fruit flavors, it gives the beer a strong port-like quality, making it a big league sipper.
This is a huge beer. The differential in strength of flavor between 10 and 8 is even greater than that between 8 and 6. The carbonation level is quite high on all these beers, but 10 has the flavor to support it. Although I rated Rochefort 10 the highest of the three, I have to admit I sort of prefer the relative domesticity of the 8 to the sheer power of the 10. Rochefort 8 has a lot of the flavor, and is easier to drink. 1,140 charactersdeadonhisfeet, Apr 06, 2012

4.35/5  rDev -2.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Aroma: Mild fruity esters, mostly raisin. Some orange citrus. Pepper spice. Rose-like alcohol. Mild pale malt. Some floral and pine hops. Complex, but not overly bold.
Appearance: Dark brown. Cannot see through even with a bright LED flashlight. Pours a tall light brown head. Good retention. Dissolves leaving a thin spotty layer.
Taste: Sweet dark fruits, some chocolate, floral hops, spicy alcohol. The fruit flavor lingers and is extremely pleasant and refreshing. Some dark malt character. The first of this style that I've found any amount of wortyness. Mild orange citrus.
Mouthfeel: Medium-full body. Mild to moderate carbonation. A little oily and creamy. Impressively it's not drying considering the 11% ABV. Very little warming from the alcohol.
Overall: Far superior to the St. Bernardus 12 that I had earlier this week (in my opinion anyways). Complex, super smooth, actually refreshing. Not overly sweet or bitter. A real treat. 946 characterssoulfly1492, Apr 06, 2012

A: Murky brown, reddish hue, looks like, whatever!

Poured from 11.2oz bottle into an Ommegang chalice.
A: Pours a very dark brown, almost black color. 1 finger of light tan head that dissapates very quickly. No lacing.
S: Lots of sweet dark fruits. Grape, raisin, plum and yeasty esters. Very pleasant and inviting.
T: The sweet dark fruits come through again on the palate. A very nice balance between the grape and plum notes and the yeast notes. Some nice lingering dry fruitiness. Age has definitely brought some more goodness out in this one.
M: Soft pillowy feel overall. Moderate bod y with high carbonation. Slight stickiness on the lips.
Age has done wonders to this beer. It's a beautifully sweet fruity beer now. Perfect for dessert and very easy to drink. Nicely balanced and not too sweet. 775 charactersmuletrane, Apr 01, 2012

Pours very murky dark brown color with a nice 1 finger dense khaki head with good retention that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty lacing on the glass, with a decent amount of carbonation streaming up. Aromas of big plum, raisin, caramel, banana, molasses, clove, pepper, biscuit, roasted malt, light chocolate, and yeast spices. Awesome aromas with great complexity. Taste of big molasses, caramel, plum, raisin, prune, pepper, clove, banana, candi sugar, and yeast spices. Lingering notes of dark fruit, banana, molasses, candi sugar, and yeast spices on the finish for a while. Fantastic balance of sweetness and spiciness; with no cloying at all. Medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very creamy and slightly slick mouthfeel. Incredibly lush and smooth mouthfeel as well. This drinks way too smoothly for 11.3%, but is still definitely a sipper. Alcohol is practically invisible, with pretty much no warming noticed. Overall this is a beautiful Quadrupel. Big complexity, smoothness, and flavor balance. Amazing. 1,085 characterssuperspak, Mar 31, 2012

A: Pours a dark brown liquid with an uneven head. The head is light brown and compact. The head dissolves very slowly. I also find some dark particles in the head which I guess is natural sediments.
S: Banana bread, chocolate, raisins, plum and dark malts. I also find tones of yeast and ripe cherries. Alcohol is present, but very elegantly.
T: Extremely well balanced. All of the the tastes works perfectly together. Lots of chocolate, banana bread and surprisingly I also find hints of green apples and cherries. Chocolate cake with cinnamon. The alcohol is present but very delicate. There are far more tastes in there, but I can't nail them down.
M: Large bubbles. Medium to strong carbonation. The alcohol is warming the throat. Again very well balanced. 
O: It's extremely well balanced in both smell, taste and mouthfeel. Everything works really well together. I'm glad that I can lay my hands on this beer with ease at the Swedish Systembolaget. 1,039 characterseriktoyra, Mar 30, 2012

4.4/5  rDev -1.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Using a Rochefort Trappistes bowl chalice I poured it slowly reserving much of the yeast in the bottle. Rochefort 10 was a very dark mahogany brown with a thin medium beige head.
The nose was of banana bread, molasses, dark fruits typical of the style.
The flavors were of brown sugar and fruit cake.
What makes this a superstar is the supple creamy mouthfeel where everything balances to perfection. Ample carbonation, but not too much; creamy and coating with a bit of viscosity; the flavors are complex and well integrated. There is no wave after wave of flavors, it is one complex continuous presentation with a bit of alcohol warmth in the finish.
While I never considered Quad my preferred style, that's probably because I've had many inferior as my point of reference. 779 charactersBelgiumBill, Mar 27, 2012

A: Pours with a one-finger off-white head. Gorgeous pillowy head with consistently tight bubbles all around. Terrific lacing and head-retention. Body is a deep, deep brownish-red. 
S: Interesting aroma. Smells big and boozy but not dominated by the usual Belgian yeast/dark fruit combo. There’s a spicy medicinal note that really stands out as well as some chocolate cake? Then there’s some noticable alcohol-soaked dark fruit and grain plus a bit of caramel malt. 
T: So interesting. It’s just as much spice as it is fruit. Starts sweet with the yeast totally integrated so that it’s almost non-existent. There’s raisin, juniper, some woodiness and strangely the chocolate cake is still there. Alcohol is present and with the juniper it gives it a gin-like dimension.
M: Medium body with a fairly dry texture. Finishes with a modest alcohol burn. Carbonation is soft but present. 
O: This is truly a unique quad unlike any that I’ve had. It’s not a slight variation on the rest, but a near complete re-write of the book. Very impressive. 1,110 charactersmjtiernan, Mar 26, 2012

A:
Hazy gloomy dark brown in color, the pour yields thick creamy light tan head with good retention. It gradually collapses to some long lasting foamy layer and patches covering on top, high fizzy carbonation with exceptional strength of stickiness laces.
S:
Dark fruits remind me of plum and raisin yet with cherry along with a note of cocoa, dark chocolate, some smokiness, bread malt, cereal, dark sugar, liquorice and mild phenolic spice.
T:
Estery popping in mind by the trait of dark fruits, sweetness is up there from fruity, dark sugar and alcohol. Mild phenol being a bit spice to slight medicinal, subtle bitterness derives from hop and hint of smokiness. Malt is in backing by lending a hand of dough and dark bread. Alcohol lurks with a warming touch that is deceivingly hidden.
M:
Bold with a bit syrupy body, velvety yet silky smooth mouthfeel with some lively crisp from proper fit carbonation, finish is a bit dry.
O:
Nearly immaculate, it’s a superb blending of brewing and art, so tasty and briskly inviting a sip but with alcohol evilly dwells to ravage. Anyway, who care? 1,133 charactersEverydayoff, Mar 21, 2012

Swampy brown body with little activity... a milky dense cap of cream colored head sustains from start to finish. Unprecedented lacing.
Musky red wine notes, overripe dark fruits, definite vinegar presence... loads and loads of merlot type qualities, sour fruit really overshadows any potential presence of oxidation or sweet malt.
Better than Westy. There, I said it. Ripening red grapes and tannins. Roasty quad-like malt notes that suggest something sour without actually making the leap. A touch of oxidation is beginning to surface and translates to semisweet caramel or toffee, a touch of leather only adds to the overall flavor profile.
Delicious. Like nothing else I can think of. 705 charactersyamar68, Mar 16, 2012

The head dissipates, leaving some lacing around the edge of the glass and on top. Aromas of dark roasted malts, toffee, fig, plum and alcohol hit the nose. Some of these aromas are even noticeable right after you remove the bottle cap.
The flavor profile is of toffee, dark fruits like fig, plum, and dates, yeast, dark roasted malts, and the alcohol. The alcohol taste is still well hidden. The mouthfeel is full with moderate carbonation. While it is slightly creamy, it is also smooth thanks to the carbonation. This is a sipper, but it's easier to drink that some sippers.
Overall, this is one of the best quads if not one of the best beers I've ever had. It's one I would recommend to anyone who wishes to be exposed to quads. This is easily world class. 872 charactersacevenom, Mar 16, 2012

Poured into a Lion Stout tulip glass, at cellar temperature of 55-degrees Fahrenheit, which seemed to be the perfect temperature.
Be forewarned when pouring this! I initially poured about a 5-finger head. I'd advise a slow pour to start, down the side of the glass, rather than straight into the bottom as I did at the start. The head sticks around forever and takes a long time to drop.
This has an intoxicating nose, and I'm not referring to the 11.3% alcohol. Like a dark bread, made with molasses. Raisins, figs, and a bit of dark fruit all come through as well. Also some toffee and caramel. A little malty sweetness and viscosity in the middle, yet if finishes with a bit of crispness. Medium-full bodied, with a fairly dry finish.
This was absolutely amazing after dinner, and was the perfect nightcap. I slowly enjoyed every last sip of this.
Recommended, without hesitation, this is possibly the best Quad I've had to date. Certainly a benchmark Belgian Quad.
I have one more in the cellar and would like to age it for a while. I'll definitely be buying a few more of these. 1,117 charactersJonathanG, Mar 12, 2012

Complex aroma of raisins, dates, wheat bread and toffee. Plenty of alcohol to excite the nostrils.
Flavor is sweet overall with a dark fruit character. Reminiscent of dates, figs, apple cider, toffee and molasses. No hop character to be found. Alcohol sneeks in with a warm, spicy character.
Medium-full bodied with a light, dry finish from the alcohol. Smooth texture and good carbonation for such a strong beer. Even after 40-50 minutes of sitting, there are still plenty of small bubbles left to tickle the tongue.
Pretty complex beer. Lots of interesting flavors. Definitely gets better as it warms. I would recommend serving at 50-55 F. Good stuff. 744 charactersbnes09, Mar 11, 2012

It’s nice crisp when it first hits your tongue, and really envelopes your mouth with a thick warm feeling. I can pick up some fig and raisin flavors along with some mild citrus fruits like grapefruit. It has a very good aftertaste with some strong alcohol flavors.

Smell: Apples. Call me crazy, but I smell apples here, kinda reminiscent of Delirium Nocturnum. Faint rum raisin undertones. Wisp-like traces of V8.
Taste: Oh. My. Goodness. Sweet enough to make your dentist slap you. Malty as heck; you might be tempted to market this as a health food supplement. This is a clinic on how to hide high ABV; be warned, it's as easy to drink as table beer. Nice brandy-soaked fruit finish.
Mouthfeel: Docking it a bit because it's not creamy as some reviews have said it is, yet keeping it high because it's still really darn good. Think Remy Martin.
Overall: You're still reading? Get this beer! 747 charactersfullmetal1381, Mar 10, 2012

Taste is as complex as they get. The flavor begins with a chocolate splash, followed by beautiful spice as it heads toward big sweet fruits: plums, raisins, pears. Ends again with some additional chocolate. This one is highly rated for a reason. I even gave my mother a sip--who turns her nose up at anything but Coors Light--and she was wowed by it. You don’t have to be a beer snob to enjoy this one. It’s just plain good. The mouthfeel is a bit chewey, but plenty of carbonation to keep it from being syrup like.

A: Pours a dark brown hue with a huge, 5-finger, tan head that slowly dissipates, leaving a great trail down the glass and ending in a solid persistent lace.
S: Slight banana aroma with a great toffee, coffee, and chocolate background.
T: Smooth dark rich ale with a mild sweetness with a roasted malt bitterness. Strong chocolate and coffee overtones, with a nice malt background. Finishes slightly hoppy and smooth. 
M: Heavy body and high carbonation.
O: Wow – phenomenal beer! This was so smooth and tasty. This is a really strong beer but the malts blend it in so well you can’t tell. It went down way to easy for such a strong beer. I like the name 10 for it’s original starting gravity of 1.100 769 charactersckollias, Mar 08, 2012

A lot more head than I would have imagined at this ABV. Best Quad I've had by far. This one definitely improves as it warm's up so don't chill it too much. I noticed that the colder this beer is the less complex it seems to the senses. Don't dumb this down! 332 characterssymphox, Mar 07, 2012
4.59/5  rDev +2.7%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pour produces a tan and off white huge rocky head. Color is a totally opaque deep dark brown verging on black.
On the nose I get molasses, dark sweet fruits, yeast, brown sugar, fig, wood, cola, raisins. Every time I go in for another sniff it reveals another layer of complexity.
Taste follows the nose with the sweet dark fruit and woodiness. The molasses is very up front too. Lots of cherry on the mid palate and finish. I get a decent amount of heat from the alcohol that becomes fumey as it sits on my tongue. Some residual sweetness from the sugar in the finish. Also berries in the finish.
Body is highly carbonated, slightly creamy, and medium.
Overall this is an amazingly complex beer. Lived up to the hype for me. Not a huge belgian quad guy but it might be creeping up there on my style rankings after drinking this guy. 837 charactersnatemort13, Mar 07, 2012

A - Deep and mesmerizing. Elegant like the flowing hair of a young brunette vixen.

T - Delightful. This is why I pay the premiums to buy this every time I'm at the local beer store to bring home a few bottles. Among the stars of "Belgium day" when I focus on Belgian food and drink for 24 hours...
M - The effervescense is pronounced for a quad; strong carbonation like most bottle conditioned Belgians, but it's not overwhelming.
O - One of my very favorite beers, right up there with Delirium's offers (all three) and Westy 12 (the holy grail of Belgian beers).
I make time to enjoy this beer. I recommend others do to; give it a proper pour and be careful of the suspended yeast; it's not like a hefe - you don't really want it - as it will cloud and sour your experience. 945 characterszee3are0, Feb 27, 2012
4.5/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5The Trappist Rochefort 10 is a beautifully dark, rich beer. It is very alcoholic for a beer at about 11.5% which is why it is called Rochefort 10. This beer retains its head for quite a while considering its ABV which, for me, is one of the determining factors of a quality beer. Deep, complex flavors that gradually change even as your pallet adapts to the flavor like all truly great beers should, in my opinion. Flavors change from hints of dark caramel-raisiny to light floral notes at the finish which are likely brought out from the high ABV. Because this beer is a quadrupel, the alcohol is very prominent and perhaps maybe too prominent for those who are new to the wonderful world of Belgian style beers, however, to those who are accustomed to strong flavored beers this one is great! It does sound like I am going on and on about how much alcohol is detectable in this beer, but don't misinterpret this as a fault, this beer is balanced near perfectly. In summary, this beer is very complex, has a beautiful dark brown (nearly black) color, strong slightly sweet/rich smell, and a complex taste. The Trappist Rocheforts are on my all time favorites list. Absolutely Delicious! 1,187 charactersprosson, Feb 27, 2012

This smells wonderful, dark fruit, raisins. The aroma pours out of the glass.
It's got a very unique flavor, earthy hop, fruity, raisin-like, nice malty sweetness without being cloying.
Effervence from the carbonation, mouth coating with a nice sweet finish.
A great smelling and tasting beer, the flavors and aromas work fantastically together. I will most certainly have this again, on special occasions of course. 513 charactersJCaweinstein, Feb 26, 2012

4.83/5  rDev +8.1%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5What a surprise. I have been on a quest to purchase a Trappist Westvleteren 12 while living just south of Belgium. To make a long story short, they don't sell it in stores, but they have a crazy list of rules that are posted on the abbey of Saint Sixtus of Westvleteren website (http://www.sintsixtus.be/eng/brouwerij.htm#Bezettoon.).
So, I started to pick up all the interesting beers that I could find in various stores. And, I came across the Trappistes Rochefort 10. Score!
330ml bottle into a Tournei tulip. Drank February 23, 2012.
Appearance (5.0): After only drinking different Belgium beer for the past couple of weeks, I have learned how to make a good pour. The Rochefort has a thick head, roughly 1/3 the size of the pour. The head stays firm, slowly disappating over the course of the drink, leaving long laces of The dark brown beer is a nice contrast to the head.
Smell (4.5): A complex smell of cherry and chocolate, flowers and coke. Effervescent bubbles tickle the nose.
Taste (5.0): For a dark beer, the taste was fruity, but still a true Belgian feel. Despite the high alcohol content, it wasn't overwhelming in the mouth. Started and finshed creamy.
Mouthfeel (4.5): There is a response to most Belgiums for me, where the first two sips are full of bubbles. The carbination is overwhelming, but settles down for the rest of the glass.
Overall (5.0): This ranks at the top of all beers I have had. I need to sit down and try one later ... with some good friends. I'll try to brig a few home to the states if my friends are unable to find a few bottles at House of 1000 Beers (http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/15450).
I'm just lucky to have another of a "Top 10" beer ... even if by accident. 1,723 characterssbrotschul, Feb 25, 2012

smell - toasty and bready almost a coffee note, with a hint of toffee and banana. 
taste - I can't taste the alchohol which is nice... hides it very well! Sweet and a little bite to it. Plum and cherry flavour with a bit of bitterness, probably my favorite part of this beer.
mouthfeel - a little bit on the dry side on the back end but has a softness toward the front of the mouth
overall - I think the taste is better than the appearance and the fragrance, but I prefer Chimay over this anyday
see you on the next one. 596 charactersjcomp21, Feb 25, 2012

dark amber capped by a small silky head that only reduces slightly. Nose is malt, sugar, and yeast. Taste is burnt sugar upfront, slight biscuit, hint of dark fruit. Alchohol rears its head as this critter warms. Silky creamy mouthfeel, medium bodied. 336 charactersUDbeernut, Feb 20, 2012
4.42/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Bottle from Dusty's Cellar in Okemos MI. About for a bottle $6.25 with a 10% off card.
Poured into a snifter. First quad tasting, and besides that BA description (which isn't as insightful as most) I don't really know what to expect. Paired with some Pizza House deep-dish left-overs to cleanse the palette. Reason for consuming, Whitley's done with the vagina monologues (good job girl). 
I have seen the rating before, and I will do my best not to be biased.
A&S: Very strong sweet, fruity (apples and pears) cider smell, with notes of caramel. Elegant mid-ranged black colored beer (kinda raisin colored). This beer has a lot of unfilteredness to it, large chunks in both the bottle and the glass. Pours about 2 fingers of fizzy light tan head. Creamy head in maintained for a while at about a quarter of a finger --&gt; nothing but a ring after a few mins.
T&M: Very bold/powerful taste. Upfront it has similar characteristics to the smell (apples and pear), but toward the finish its more on the dark fruits (raisins) spectrum. Upfront the alcohol is well hidden and towards the back (especially when its warmer) it gets quite hot (almost too hot). The finish is a bit sour with a touch of bourbon and no real bitterness, its also very, very smooth. Not really what I expected as far as mouthfeel. Its very high bubbly carbonation and first, but after some time it really dies to almost nothing. High medium to full for the body. I would suggest drinking at around 45 to 50, I get really hot (in alcohol) after that.
O: I thought it was a little overrated [I was a little generous giving it a 4.5 for taste (it probably deserved somewhere in between a 4 and a 4.50]3. I'm glad I tried it, but I don't think I'll buy it again, at least for the price of 6.10 a bottle. But don't get me wrong if someone was offering... I'd be all over it. Even though I haven't review this style before, I kinda see what they are aiming for and I don't think its really my kind of beer. This beer would pair perfectly with steak. 2,020 charactersminterro, Feb 20, 2012

A - Pours out slightly viscous-looking. Body is very dark brown with the faintest of amber colored highlights. Yields 2 1/2 fingers of fine light tan head. Moderate lacing.
S - Incredibly complex and pungent esters are the number one characteristic here. Lots of plum as well as an amazing boozy red wine aroma. Hops take a minor role adding just enough spice to the background to make things interesting.
T - Brown bread, raisins and burnt sugar up front. Booziness comes in toward the middle and holds strong all the way down. Alcohol and hop bitterness come in toward the finish amid the complex, sweet and fruity malt base.
M - Thinner than I expected just from how it looked coming out of the bottle. Wonderful boozy warming sensation in the chest after each sip. Leaves a syrupy, sticky feeling in my mouth, but that just lends to its "sipper" qualtiy. Great beer. 917 charactersrundocrun, Feb 19, 2012

S- Big on caramel and darker fruit notes. An underlying sweet and sour scents mingle together. Very complex scent overall.
T- Beautifully complex. Starts off somewhat sour with dark fruit flavors and lighter malts. Then goes a little darker in the malt category before a switch to a sweet mixture of a bready taste and caramel. The caramel flavor profile is very sweet and soft, almost like a piece of candy. Finishes with the slightest of alcohol heat.
M- Kind of thicker and syrupy. Pairs fairly well with the flavor profile and a slight burn of alcohol hits as it slides down your throat.
Overall, I liked it much more that the 8. Much more complex and balanced with the fruit and malt notes. I love the sweet malt tone that comes through at the end. 923 charactersboilermakerbrew, Feb 19, 2012

Drank as part of a vertical tasting of the three offerings from Rochefort.
A: Pours almost black with hints of mahogany and light visible carbonation at the edges. Two finger tan head that reduces to a thin layer of bubbles. Lots of sediment/yeast and lots of lacing.
S: Light roasted malts with fruits - raisin, apple, and plum - plus hints of chocolate and caramel/toffee sweetness.
T: Lots of dark fruit - cherries, raisin, and plum - plus apple chocolate, and candy sugar. Slightly vinous with some hints of bready malts. Sweeter than the Rochefort 6 and Rochefort 8 but not cloying.
M: Medium bodied with moderate amounts of carbonation. Creamy.
O: Slight hints of the alcohol but that is not surprising at 11.3% ABV - nice complexity and balance. Overall very enjoyable but the 12 oz bottle is the perfect serving. My second favorite of the Rochefort beers to the Rochefort 8. 910 charactersdbrauneis, Feb 19, 2012

T: Dark chocolate covered fruits. Brown sugar and malt. While it is a 11.3%, it's not boozy at all, until a little bit at the end.
M: Medium. Creamy. Pretty good carbonation, nice fine bubbles.

St. Bernardus and Chimay Blue are two beers very close to this in style and taste if you would like to experiment.

4.77/5  rDev +6.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5330ml bottle into Duvel tulip. Bottled February 2, 2011, drank February 17, 2012.
Appearance: Careful pour yields a 2 inch, fizzy offwhite head that dissipates steadily and leaves a single lacing arch. Pours a dark brown and occasionally leaves short lasting spots of lacing.
Smell: Red wine grapes and plum. Effervescent, with an undercurrent of fresh bread. Chocolate covered raisins, slight cola. Cherry and flowery aromas come out with time. That endless, constantly growing and developing aroma you want from a quad. Always complex, always balanced, always inviting.
Taste: Dark fruit, Belgian yeast, and dark candi sugar flavors. Moderately hot finish. Pastry like malt underneath, beautifully accentuated by the creamy mouthfeel.
In general, the flavor is like eating a light cake-y pastry covered in an amazing cherry, black currant, plum flavored jam. Leather and tobacco flavors reminiscent of some red wines coast on top of the hot aftertaste.
The flavor is as bountiful as the aroma, but bolder. There's uncountably many different notes, but everything marries beautifully. The overall impression is constant, tasting like darker red wine flavors, deep BSDA dark fruit, sweet cake pastries, Belgian yeast, and lively alcohol, with all of it being constantly elevated by the subtle complexities in each sip. 
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied. Soft and creamy. High carbonation that sometimes bothers me, but seems just right on this occasion (maybe 1 year is the best time to drink this beer, mouthfeel-wise, at least for my tastes). 
Overall: Another beer that is widely regarded as a classic in virtue of it just being that damn good. I'll always remember the first time I tried it. The experience opened up my understanding of how exciting and delicious beer could be.
Every beer drinker should try at least one bottle of Trappistes Rochefort 10. 1,860 charactersPahn, Feb 17, 2012

My favorite this month. 656 charactersgreencovesteve, Feb 16, 2012

A- Dark cloudy brown color similar to muddy water. Off white 1 finger head that left some nice lacing and alcohol legs.
S- Amazingly complex. Smells of rum soaked raisins, ripe figs and prunes, vanilla, sweet malts and brown sugar. With a nice touch of alcohol.
T- WOW this is a great complex tasting beer. There is some sweet malt and fruity yeast esters put together with a nice bitterness. There is a warming from the alcohol in the back of the throat and down your chest. Love the dark fruit flavors mixed with a nice touch of alcohol that cleanses the palate for the next sip.
M- Heavy carbonation almost like champagne. Very smooth really great mouthfeel.
O- Full disclosure I have had this beer many many times. Just thought it was about time that I reviewed it. This is one of my favorite beers, in fact I drink this beer enough for it to qualify as my go to beer. Its one of the beers that got me into craft beer. So I pay homedge. Thank you Trappist monks for making beer that repels zombies and gets me closer to Heaven. 1,101 charactersHopsHopenstein, Feb 16, 2012

T- Caramel, bread and dark fruit all accompanied by the standard Belgian yeast and spiciness.
M- Medium bodied with a good carbonation level.
O- I am not the biggest fan of this style in the first place, but this is one of the better ones. 419 characterscamil1mj, Feb 16, 2012

A- Pours a very hazy, murky beer bottle brown. With a cream colored head that left very little lacing.
S- Smells of breads, caramel malts, raisins and dark fruits. There is little bit of brown sugar and hints of nuts.
T- WONDERFUL! Very well balanced. All the smells are there. The "bread" really comes out. Not overly sweet. 
M- It has some warmth to it. Medium/Heavy body to it. 
O- This is a beer that I've had many times and I enjoy it time, after time, after time. Highly recommend. This is a great example of the style. 581 charactersrfbenavi80, Feb 16, 2012

Pours dark amber brown murky with a nice 1.5 finger off-white fluffy head that leaves great lacing. The nose has some sweet dark fruits like raisins, cherries or figs then some tartness like apple and finally followed by a Belgium yeast aroma. Right up front on the taste is that sweet dark fruit taste like raisins or figs a touch of alcohol then that great bready Belgium yeast flavor that I love with quads. Smooth, it coats my mouth very well but to me its a little too carbonated. Over all this is a great beer, it isn't as good as Westy12 or Pannepot but for availability this is a very good beer. 632 charactersphisigben, Feb 14, 2012

I can almost forget how much I love a good Belgian beer until I smell it. This one has so much goodness to it, I don't know where to begin: A bit of caramel, lots of dark fruit, rich deep malt tones, yeast, a little sugar, wood, and a good dose of alcohol. Yum!
Yeast and spiced bread malts up front. Hint of caramel to accentuate. Dark fruit, oak and alcohol on the back end. So good.
This beer was medium bodied and well carbonated, as it tingles when held on the tongue. It doesn't get bogged down, doesn't get sticky or leave you overly dry. For the style it's... perfect. 761 charactersCFHMagnet, Feb 11, 2012

A: This beer is a very dark brown, almost completely opaque save for a slight reddish tint when held up to a light. There is a large, foamy, off-white head which fades fairly quickly to a ring of foam around the edges.
S: The first thing I detect is a sweet, bready malt flavor. Dark fruit flavors follow: plum, prune and raisin. Maybe a little cherry.
T: There is a smooth maltiness throughout the whole beer. The same fruit flavors I caught in the smell are present here, though they are complemented by vanilla as well. The finish is bready with a hint of banana. Next to no taste from the +11% ABV.
M: Thick and chewy with a moderate amount of carbonation.
O: A heavy, interesting beer. Very malty and complex. Alcohol is incredibly well hidden. 798 charactersWankelEngine, Feb 11, 2012

A: A beautiful golden brown color, with a single finger of hear with a khaki color that dissipates in a few moments, nice lacing with this one.
S: Dried prunes, cherries, and just a tiny hint of alcohol when you look for it.
T: Sweet, much like the nose indicated, cherries and prunes rule the flavor but for some reason i taste a nice amount of milk chocolate. Alcohol is faintly noticeable, this has the alcohol taste of a 5-6% ABV beer. 
M: Smooth, carbonated goodness, a slight tickle from the bubbles as it makes its way down to its resting place...at least for a few hours.
Overall: I have noticed that there are a fair amount of beers on this site that have been hyped to be better than they are, but this one is up there with ZD in my top 5. I may try aging a couple of these to see how the flavor changes with time. 859 charactersMicrobrewtaster, Feb 10, 2012

Not the most beautiful beer in a glass but certainly adequate. The smell is dark fruit (plum, prune, figs and a hint of vanilla). The taste follows the scent but so well integrated that it takes a bit of sipping to fully identify all that is going on in this very complex brew. This beer has wonderful carbonation and at times I thought I picked up a cola taste and the mouth feel when held on the tongue for a bit was similar to a mouthful of Coke with the fizzy tingly feeling. This is a monumental beer. I can't recall enjoying a beer more. If Westvleteren 12 is better than this then I don't want to know about it. Simple outstanding! 748 charactersNuke77, Feb 09, 2012

This beer has a molasses smell. Smell wasn't overly memorable, but the taste made up for that.

I was so excited to try this brew, and it met every expectation and went beyond. The color is a beautiful dark hue that is 99% opaque except for a brilliant burgundy rim that appears if you hold it up to a light source. The scent was deep and nose-warming, and when I took it into my mouth, immediate sensations of dark berries and cherries took over. The swallow was accompanied by a flash of heat in my cheeks and throat, evidence of the 11.3% alcohol level. However, nothing painful about it... just concocted bliss. Half way done with the bottle, I enjoyed the changing flavors as it casually warmed in the room. I might have started it off too cold, or maybe the alcohol was affecting me, but I noticed as I drank and as it got warmer, the taste improved even more. I didn't serve it very cold, just maybe 20 minutes in the fridge after I returned home. Anyway, enough of this whole sexual experience I had with this brew. If I had three thumbs, they would all be up for this wonderful drink. 1,087 charactersshigg85, Feb 07, 2012

I tend to find Quads a bit too strong for my taste but after having this one, I think it's safe to say that the characteristics of the beer itself outweigh any of the negatives that too much booze brings to the table. This was wonderful to drink and may have been the strongest beer that I've ever enjoyed at a normal pace!
This poured quite cloudy with a plum hue and a nice, frothy head. There was a bit of sediment too and an overwhelming boozy aspect to the aroma. Most of the flavors were in the taste, accordingly, with fig, apricot, and a bit of candied sugar all melding together quite nicely. As the beer warmed up and I worked my way throughout the contents of my pint glass, this got better and better. By the time I reached the bottom, the strong and solid taste of this came through, with sweet fruit dominating over the alcohol. 
Although this wasn't the most appealing beer up front, this was wonderful to enjoy once the strength of it receded a bit. Beers don't get much more classic than this but that doesn't mean that this is for everyone. I'm not a huge fan of Quadrupels but I can see why this is so popular on here. What this lacked in flash, it more than made up for with the array of dark fruits and perfect body I enjoyed here. Give it time to warm up and most likely, you'll warm up to this as well. 1,400 charactersJerzDevl2000, Feb 02, 2012

S: Notes of belgian candied sugar, munich and crystal malt. Slight hints of plum, apple, hazelnut, and cinnamon.
T: First notes are of munich, crystal, and a touch of pilsner malt all combined into a heavenly complexity. Secondary flavors are plum, fig, corriander, and walnut . Non dry aftertaste with notes of cinnamon, citrus peel and banana. 
M: Medium to medium heavy body, with low carbonation. Very pronounced alcohol warming. More sweet (in a malto-detrin thick way) than bitter.
O: This beer is one of the top tier, elite beers that have ever been produced. My favorite aspects of this beer is the sheer balance, complexity and depth. Amazing. This ruins all others. 
Do yourself a favor, if you see this beer anywhere, buy it!!! and make sure to consume it at cellar, not fridge temperatures. 1,206 charactersrodney45, Jan 29, 2012

A: Pours a hazy mahogany brown color with some amber highlights. Aggressive pour leads to a half-finger light tan head that fades slowly to a nice little ring around the outside. Lacing is pretty non-existant.
S: Ooh boy. What a nose. Tons of sweet malts, bready yeast, caramel, caramelized sugar and figs. Alcohol has to be there but everything is blended so well that is really tough to pick up.
T: Follows the noes almost di-rectly. With everything blending together to make such a wonderfully sweet and inviting flavor. At 11.3% it's high octane and well hidden. There's not a chance that you're picking up alcohol with all of this wonderful malt and subtle begian spice.
M: Creamy, subtly carbonated with just enough to lift the flavors to your taste buds and leave them.
O: A really wonderful beer. Quintessential Belgian beer and at $5 per bottle and always available at my shop, this is one to admire. 963 characterssuspect, Jan 29, 2012

S: yeasty smelling. I get banana, dates, raisins, and some roasted flavors. 
T: dominated by the yeasty notes again. Slightly bitter and sweet, with a lot of dark fruit esters with roasted malt. 
M: smooth, thick, and heavily carbonated. Not too thick, it allows the carbonation to come through, but just enough to be smooth. The carbonation is fine. 
O: great beer, can't believe I haven't had it yet. Got it for $6 for an 11.2 ounce bottle - well worth it. One of the best if not the best quads out there. 633 charactersHolland, Jan 29, 2012

4.5/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from bottle to a tulip glass. The beer pours a rich murky brown color with a thick 2 finger cream head. Good retention and lacing throughout. The nose is that of toasted malt together with fruit and malty sweetness. The yeast is light and adds a hint of fruity flavor. A hint of heat. The flavor is quite complex: roasted malty sweetness, fruit, hints of chocolate. The alcohol is hidden quite well but reveals some heat on the tail end. The beer finishes with syrup mouthfeel and hints of cereal grains with a lingering fruit fig-like flavor. Good. Overall, this is a good beer. I enjoyed it very much and would drink again, recommended. 645 charactershopfacebrew, Jan 28, 2012

A - Pour is an opaque dark brown with tons of sedinment. One finger of thick medium brown head sits on top with a dot of brown yeast sediment sitting in the middle. Good retention with a half finger and some spotty lace.
S - Huge dark fruit, port, sugar, yeast, very smooth smelling vinous notes. A great aroma. No alcohol present. I can only describe the aroma as very smooth and extremely pleasant.
T - Yeast, some spice, great dark fruit, definite port qualities, dark candi sugars, boozy fruitcake, sweet Belgian-style sugar and sweet malts. Nice. The mild alcohol note is pretty nice and warming.
M - Mild carbonation, big body, very viscous with sweet finish that lingers on the tongue. Incredibly smooth.
O/D - An extremely smooth, rich, and complex Quad. Even around 2 years age on this makes a big difference. No booze is present and the flavours really have blended together. Great.
Original:
A - Pours a nice murky brown. Tons of sedinment with a tan coloured head of one finger. Carbonation intermingling with the sediment is neat to watch.
S - Really inviting aroma. Smells a bit hot, lot's of dark fruit aromas and port. 
T - Boozy and sweet. I don't get any of the dark fruits from the aroma in the flavour. Some dark sugars maybe. The heat from the booze really dominates unfortunately but some of the other flavours pull through and show you what this beer has the potential to be down the road.
M - Coats the mouth wonderfully and the carbonation is good but not too powerful. Taste lingers for a really long time.
D - If the booziness could drop off this with age then this could be really drinkable even at its high abv.
I've had this aged for 7 years before and it was superb. The booziness in the fresher bottle holds it back alot 1,924 charactersbylerteck, Jan 28, 2012

A: Very nice thick cream colored head on top of a nice deep rich brown ale. Head dissipates slowly but laces very nicely.
S: Starts off with rich dark fruit and dark malty sweetness, a hint of yeast gives it some robustness along with just a whiff of the alcohol heat. I wish I could scent my room with it.
T: Lots of complex flavors, the dark fruit and malts give this brew a nice start keeping things light. Fruity/malty sweetness has a hint of dark chocolate that leads into some hints of yeast that give an excellent filling flavor. The alcohol slowly creeps in becoming more apparent towards the end that gives a nice palate cleansing effect while still retaining a touch of cereal/grains in the aftertaste. Simply amazing...
M: Excellent light-syrupy mouthfeel that I find all Trappist ales to possess, coating the mouth well and allowing all the flavors to have the greatest effect while balancing well with the carbonation that keeps it from becoming to overbearing. Loved it....
Overall I'll definitely be drinking this often for special occasions, a great relax and enjoy brew. 1,128 charactersS7R4nG3, Jan 27, 2012

2010 bottle into Duvel tulip.
A - pours a hazy chocolate brown with ruby highlights and minimal tan head. No lacing.
S - prunes, figs, caramel, fresh baked banana bread, licorice, stone fruits, and faint chocolate.
T - stone fruits, caramel, toasted bread, burnt chocolate, tobacco. Some astringency.
M - medium-full (candi sugar dried it out), but I was left wanting a tad more carbonation.
O - not quite Westy XII, but still great. Definately better with some age on it, but the low carbonation made this bottle a tad too sweet for me. 555 charactersCinderbike, Jan 26, 2012

Bottle to Westvletren 12 (small) chalice
From notes. This was beer #2 that was enjoyed as part of a blind Quad tasting - to warm our palates before the real tasting - in Utrecht (December 2011). Thanks Jeffo and doopiedoopiedoo for the hospitality!
A: Deep tint of brown. 0.5 (mocha) fingernail head on Jeffo's pour - I was being honest.
S: Currants, caramelized brown sugar, toffee, coffee, and plums. Hint of sour funk though which was weird. 
T: Taste a bit better than it smells, but still seems a bit off.
M: Medium-full bodied with soft carbonation.
O: This was my least favorite of the five being poured, but I think the bottle may have been off. We had a lengthy discussion about this, but I don't really remember what the conclusion was. I'll come back to it again at some point in the future and probably re-review it just for kicks. 863 charactersspdyfire83, Jan 25, 2012

S - Smells wonder full. Picking up dark fruits, berries, raisins, prunes and sweet fig. It also has a milky quality to it. Like condensed milk with a hint of bananas. Alcohol is faint but its there.
T - Caramel sweetness with berries, raisins and alcohol. Hints of chocolate, Belgium spice and more alcohol. This stuff is delicious.
M - The mouth feel is creamy smooth with soft carbonation. Its silky and subtle. Perfect.
O - Amazing to say the least. I thought 8 dollars was a bit steep but now I realize I was wrong. This beer is delicious and is worth every penny I payed for it. If you like dark fruit and alcohol warmth with subtle complexities then I highly recommend this. Its a sipper. 838 charactersdepechemode1983, Jan 21, 2012

T - mild sweetness on the front. Very similar to the nose ad far as fruit and spice character goes. Lots of raisins and figs. Some hints of chocolate in the middle. Alcohol is apparent but in notes of spice and a bit of warming in the back of the mouth.
M - full bodied. Generious carbonation. Very bubbley which helps keep this beer from being cloying.

A. Pours a deep deep brown, rich two finger head in an off white color, settles to a 1 finger head and finally rests many minutes later at a 2mm ring. Mild lacing.
S. Smells of sweet fruit, bready yeast, doughy 
T. Tastes very bready, with a slight flavor of coca, figs and slight fruit.
M. Medium-thick body, high carbonation, thick and chewy, with a soft dry finish
O. A great beer, very full flavored and filling! This is a wonderful beer that hides it's 10% very well. Sweet and bready makes for a nice fair and even flavor. It's great to have such a nice Belgian that is so readily available around the country. If you see this on the shelf, stop ignoring it and give it a try. Well worth the $6.00! 755 charactersMBrausen, Jan 20, 2012

S: Ripe red grapes, plums, raisins. Hints of vanilla and carmel malt.
T: Lots of dark dried fruits, brown sugar, a bit of vanilla. Gets a some spice near the finish, a bit of pepper? Some warming alcohol in the finish. Not as complex as I thought it would be.
M: Medium body, a bit on the higher side for carbonation, but it's still pretty soft and silky
O: It's really well made and pretty good, but I think I actually prefer the 8. Thought it would be smoother. It is a slow sipper with big alcohol warmness in the finish. Would like to try this with some age on it, I'm sure it gets a lot better. 783 charactersherman77, Jan 19, 2012

Very, very dark ruby with minimal beige head.  A little murky with some sediment even though I tried to decant it carefully.
Smells wonderful.  Sweet and rich with a bit of an alcohol bite.  Mostly dark fruit richness.
Tastes sweet and complex.  Some mineral character makes it almost seem salty.  Not really as yeasty as I'd hoped.  Alcohol is fairly evident.  Just a little raw, maybe this needed to sit longer.
Medium-low viscosity with very nice carbonation.  Could have stood to be a bit thicker.
A fine beer but I find that I still prefer St Bernardus Abt 12.  I'll probably have to try one of these with more age on it, though.  If I do I'll update the review. 776 charactersmariposafan, Jan 15, 2012

Pours deep murky brown with a small off white head that doesn't stick around for long. 
The aroma on this beer is simply incredible. The dark fruits really dominate, figs, raisins, grapes, and dates. The there's also hints of toffee, butterscotch, brandy and some of Belgium's finest yeast.
Wow. And more wow. Tastes like an orgy of dark fruits all soaked in warm booziness. 
This beer is like an old friend, we catch up every 6 months or so and enjoy each others company for while. I keep forgetting how delicious it is. Probably should be crowned King of Belgium. 646 characters, Jan 15, 2012

Smells of yeast, coriander, and booze.
Taste is of sweet and roasted malts, bitter spice, alcohol, very complex, and strangely winey.
Feels creamy from the tiny bubbles, and a little hot from the alcohol.
I was expecting this to be a little smoother, yet I still enjoyed the beer immensely.

S - The nose has a strong dark fruit presence. I am getting plum, fig, raisin, red apple, and red grapes. There are also some aromas of belgian yeast, brown sugar, and some milk chocolate. The alcohol isn't even noticeable to me at all, which is really surprising. 
T - The taste starts off with some bready malt and a good amount of the dark fruit flavors that were mentioned in nose. There is some chocolate flavor, as well as a little bit of brown sugar. There is some alcohol presence, but very minimal. The finish leaves some lingering dark fruit sweetness and maltiness, as well as a little bit of booziness. 
M - This has a body that is on the heavier side of medium and nice smooth carbonation. This beer goes down easy, and it has an extremely smooth feel to it. There is a good amount of sweetness that never gets cloying. Also, there is a little bit of bitterness to balance it out. Some boozy warmth is present on the back end. 
O - This has awesome drinkability. It has great flavor and a super smooth mouthfeel. Overall, I think is a great beer, and it definitely lived up to the hype. I really can't wait to pick some of these up for aging, because I really think a year on this would make it even more incredible. I recommend picking this one up for sure. I will be buying more. 1,496 charactersJizackFH, Jan 13, 2012

In no particular order, smells of vanilla, raisin, cocoa, and a little banana.
This oozes with complexity. The cocoa is what I pick up first, then banana, toffee, fig, vanilla, brown sugar... pretty much captures anything that's sweet and brown. I even get a little licorice on the back end. 
Oh damn, this is so smooth. It's warming, but the body is full and soft. I want to gulp it, but know sipping and savoring is the way to go.
I always knew this is a classic but always passed because it's easily available. This will be finding it's way to my fridge many more times. 677 charactersVonerichs, Jan 07, 2012

4.14/5  rDev -7.4%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 411.2 fl oz bottle served in a pint glass, reviewed live:
A - Pours an incredibly dark shade of amber/brown, with a tan 3 finger head. The head's thinner than expected, and retention is pretty poor, though excusable considering the ABV. 
S - Full sweet malt, sugar, fruity yeast esters, and caramel. The strong malty aroma works well with the aromatic yeast. Nice. 
T - Quality malt foundation compliments the yeast bouquet. Sugary candy contrasts tart raisins, fruity, and bitter alcohol. It's a little toasty through the finish, which has a slight alcohol burn (I'd never guess it at 11.3%, though). 
M - Full, smooth on the finish. It's carbonated well, and the mouthfeel compliments the beer as a whole. 
D - High quality, well built and balanced, and it hides its ABV really well. A great beer that I'll have again. 824 charactersblakelive784, Jan 05, 2012

4.62/5  rDev +3.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A: The beer is hardly out of the bottle and a large chestnut foam has already engulfed half the glass. Beneath sits a nice deep-brown brew that comes off as even darker thanks to a decent cloudiness. Lacing is thick and fantastic. My only problem is the head faded a little too quickly than it should have. Otherwise, looks like a quad to me.
S: Yikes, there's a lot going on in here! From the yeast I get lots of banana and taffy notes, no to mention a healthy dose of dark and candied fruit, like dark jams (grape, blackberry, blackcurrant etc.). An odd coconut-like aroma popped out to me at first but faded pretty quickly. Interesting... On the malt side comes a heavy, refined caramel-like sweetness. I can't really smell the alcohol, but I can sure feel it on the inside of my nose. A little spiciness might be from aroma hops or some sort of malt/yeast combo. Overall very complex and certainly a challenge to describe (probably the biggest reason I've put off reviewing this one for so long).
T: Here we go... The essential flavor of the beer remains relatively constant throughout most of the sip, becoming only a little more complex as it goes on. It's really a delicious combination of fruity yeast and sweet malts that is so much more than just the sum of its parts. Combined with a brief initial chocolate taste, it tastes kind of like a liquified chocolate cordial; not something I'd normally like, but here it works beautifully. Despite the prominent sweetness, the hop presence is also relatively strong and reigns things in very well; this definitely sets it apart from some of the other quads I've had recently, like the Struise St. Amatus. The alcohol shows in the middle/end, adding the faintest medicinal character and warming the throat as it goes down. This is probably the biggest problem I have with this beer: it's just too damn hot. Besides that, things are pretty groovy. Finishes with a lingering sweetness and a whiff of alcohol.
M: Medium-heavy in body, with a fantastically vibrant carbonation that really lightens things up a lot. Like the taste, the alcohol is a bit too much and keeps it from earning a 5. 
O: When I first went to Belgium in 2007, I didn't really like dark beers. This one, however, always remained the exception. If it wasn't for the heat, I'd say it couldn't be beat. My vote for the classic example of a quad. 2,368 charactersBMoldy, Jan 03, 2012

A: Pours a very deep brown that is fully hazy and does not allow even the smallest amount of light to permeate, pours with three fingers of extremely fine head that is medium tan in color and lingers very nicely, leaves a large amount of lacing on the glass
S: woody and musty in a very nice way, kind of like a favorite blanket from when you were a kid
T: oh yea, this is a quad, licorice lingers on the mouth afterwards after coming in mid sip, definitly has a slight alcohol tinge in the taste but not off putting, just enough to remind you that it is there, taste begins with something kind of sweet but in a deep way, kind of like caramelized sugar
M: very slight alcohol burn, medium carbonation, smooth and leaves the mouth feeling slightly burnt but in a way that induces salivation 
O: a real nice brew, tastes great, appearance is spot on, from my experience the wonderful monk over at rochefort really just make beers that are spot on for the style, real nice job here 1,001 charactersBigPlay1824, Jan 02, 2012

A: Deep opaque brown with a thin tan head. 
S: Very sweet, brown sugar and other sugars are huge in the nose, slight alcohol, and slight cocoa powder. This is very strong and a lot to take in at first, very thick smell even. I'm not used to this, but I'm becoming acquainted with it as I sip.
T: Very sweet and malty, there's a lot of brown sugar on the finish with a slight alcohol kick. Bready malts take the forefront with toasted notes throughout.
M: This is the thickest beer I've ever had, I feel like I need to chew it. There's a lot of carbonation as well, I can't tell if the body is foamy in my mouth or turning to a bread like feel. This is great though, but be sure to sip slowly it's very thick.
O: After being very underwhelmed with 6 and 8, this redeems the Rochefort name for me. This is a very thick, very sweet, downright intimidating beer. You need to take your time with this to fully enjoy it, from the intense scent to the intense flavor and mouthfeel, this is a beer you'll find yourself liking more and more each sip and wishing you had more when it's gone. I would love to try this with some cheese. 1,227 characterskeanex, Dec 30, 2011

I am amazed at the appearance of this beer. It is a beautiful reddish brown. It's not even that dark, but it is definitely cloudy. This Quad drops a finger thick creamy khaki colored head onto the the top of the beer. The head foams and laces around the side of the glass. After long contemplation I've decided Rochefort 10 looks like the warm rich colored milk chocolate that chocolatiers cooks up.
The aroma profile is very complex and changes from sniff to sniff. Be patient and savour this beer. First I smell bubblegum, dark fruits and brown sugar. There is a huge dose of pleasant alcohol that is very balanced next to the flavor of the beer. Look for mildly earthy and floral hops that come secondary. 
The immediate taste is of warming malt sugars, spice and a deeply alcoholic finish. My tongue begins to recognize this beer with small thoughtful sips. Ester flavors emerge, clove and banana. Then peppermint and floral hops. Madeira and Port flavors. Then finishes with notes of carob.
The mouthfeel warm and malty with a ton of balanced complexity. Wine-like, slightly dry,a little grainy, slightly tart. Overall just right. 
This is one of the finest ales I have had in my life. If you at all cherish the art of beer and brewing or at least want to feel important look for this beer. It is full of complexity and character and will not disappoint. Don't be discouraged by the $8.00 price tag. Check your stomach at the door and sip an savor this Trappist gem. 1,551 charactersBerkeleyBeerMan, Dec 28, 2011

Directly reviewed in comparison to the Westvleteren 12.
The beer starts fruity with notes of dark dried plums and black cherries, not too sweet. In the middle you can notice a nice malty character with a fine but only very small bitterness and a great herbal note. No hints of the 11,3%. 
The dark fruity flavours develop and are still present in the end, while the sweetness and the hops keep in the background all the time.

Pours an opaque caramel brown. Little bit of head dissipates almost immediately.
Smell of toffee, leather, plums, dark cherries, raisins.
Taste layered of similar notes to the nose: toffee, sweet dark cherries, raisins and dried fruits, leather, tobacco, chocolate. No oxidation present, not the slightest hint of alcohol.
Very highly carbonated for the age, a bit fizzy, but it's very smooth. The carb lights it up a bit early but then it's just right - not thick or thin, just well-suited to letting the flavors take over.
Stellar beer. I don't know how much more it'll improve after 5 years, but I wouldn't say it'll be any worse. My only regret is that I don't have a fresh one on hand to compare it to immediately. 844 charactersOSUBeerStudent, Dec 23, 2011

This one, the strongest and livliest taste.
Nice dark color too.
The bars that have this----know their beers.
Have had it many times in many diff bars in 3

They know what they have when they have this beer. It is treated special.
There may be better, tho, not many...and I will be WOWED to taste a better dark beer. I have yet to taste many of the beers ahead of this,on THIS BA list, (List keeps changing).... but, you can certainly tell---there is no doubt, this is a world class top of the line beer.

Appearance - Amazing head on this beer. Great lacing, sticks to the sides of my Trappistes Rochefort glass chalice (oh boy, already I'm seemingly biased). Off-white/ beige and incredibly creamy. A thick layer of head as well. This retains a great amount of head as it sits, hardly disperses over time. Dark, almost black. An unprecedented amount of sediment when held up to the light -- shocking, really. Definitely the characteristics of a rich, Belgian Quad.
Smell - Warm notes of yeast with dark fruits, honey and light spice. Lots of raisin, vanilla, bread and black current come to mind. A very light hop on the nose as well. 
Taste - Mind-blowing. Traces of plum, licorice, candy sugars and honey. Naturally sweet. For being a 11.3% abv beer, this is impressively smooth on the tongue. The alcohol is completely disguised and can only be noticed during the aftertaste. This is easily one of the most complex and balanced Quads available from Belgium. Toffee, yeast, caramel and dark cherries/ figs, too.
Mouthfeel - An amazing feel across the palate. Perhaps one of the best I have yet to experience. The sugars manage to stimulate all parts of the mouth and leave no area untouched. Astounding! Very syrupy, almost like honey coating the mouth. Complex and distinct. Rich and chewy. A beautifully heavy ale.
Overall - Wonderfully complex. Rich and sweet, yet remaining dry and bready. A dizzying experience! A monstrous Quad that demands your attention and makes the hairs on the back of your neck stand up on each sip (a good thing in my books!). Beautifully balanced. Somehow seems to master many startling, in depth flavors within each bottle. Definitely enjoy one of these after being somewhat warmed (not directly out of the fridge). I suggest serving this anywhere between 12-14°C to fully take in the breadth of this Quad. Simply amazing. Enjoy!! 2,061 charactersAgent1, Dec 20, 2011

The darkest of the three Trappistes. This is a dark Chestnut beer with a 1 finger tan head. Beer is actively carbonated. Also, unlike the other two I don't see any sediment.
Aroma is simple of brown sugar bread and molasses.
Mouthfeel: decent
Taste: Like the aroma, simple brown sugar without any fruit.
Notes: This is supposed to be the Flagship of the Trappiste fleet? This is perhaps the least complex and interesting of all of them.
 Well, I've now had all three Trappistes. I must say I am underwhelmed and disappointed. While not bad, none of the three captured my imagination. The Trappiste ales are dark and sweet but lack the raisin/ plum/ date/ fig flavors that would make them special. I'm glad I tried them but I can't see myself buying these again. 835 charactersfx20736, Dec 17, 2011
5/5  rDev +11.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This is my first review, ever.
I've spent a few weeks tasting all of the Trappist ales.
Yes, including the elusive Westvleteren 12. 
I think this one is my favorite:
Appearance: Pours nearly black into a St. Bernardus chalice. 
Light tan head, very foamy, clinging lace.
Smell: SO hard to describe. It smells like the first girl you fell in love with. It's sensual and musky. Cinnamon, clove, fig. Dark fruits and an unapologetic wave of alcohol. Almost perfumed, like a forbidden Marrakech harem. Incredibly lovely and appealing.
Taste: Mysterious. A sipper. Dark and fruity. Then a sudden burst of pure alcohol in the aftertaste. The 11.3% ABV suddenly kicks in your door.
Mouthfeel: Velvety.
Overall: Cognac-like. Not a beer for gulping down after a workout or something. A beer for sitting around a fire, for sipping while reading a favorite book. It usually takes me around 2 hours to finish a 12 oz bottle of this beer. Time well spent. 949 charactersmetromiami, Dec 17, 2011

4.31/5  rDev -3.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5A--Deep reddish-brown color. When poured into a tulip glass, it has a beautiful 3-finger light tan head. The head settles into a thin layer and leaves heavy lacing.
S--burnt sugar, nutmeg, caramelized fruit, black cherries. Other reviewers mentioned hints of banana, which definitely made an appearance.
T--tons of malt, as expected. Slightly nutty (cashew/hazelnut). The alcohol is barely noticeable until a tiny bite at the finish. Virtually no bitterness.
M--impossibly creamy. It has a smooth, sticky consistency that can best be described as similar to whole milk. Carbonation is perfect--slightly fizzy, but this beer is thick enough that it doesn't jump out at you.
O--A bit pricey ($5.75 for a 330mL bottle), but totally worth the splurge. Those Trappist monks certainly know what they're doing--it's always a cool experience to consume a product made from a centuries-old recipe. 888 charactersjedtheavenger, Dec 16, 2011

S: A smooth malty aroma with a light hint of the fruity characteristic common of Belgian Quads such as Abt. 12.
T: Chocolate dominates the flavor, somewhat overshadowing the fruitiness in the nose. Although, the rich date and raisin taste still lingers in the back ground in a pleasant balance.
M: Light carbonation with a smooth mouthfeel that plays well with the malt.
O: This is a fantastic offering deserving your purchase. Buy one and share it with a friend and then buy another to keep for yourself. 686 charactersJuliusWolf, Dec 15, 2011

Pours a deep mahogany brown that is highlighted by ruby and garnet hues in the light. The head reaches about an inch before it quickly subsides to a thin film. Spotty and thick bands of lace grace the sides of my glass.
Aromas and flavor are tops for the quads that I have enjoyed. Raisins, dates, toffee, caramel, and rich chocolatey undertones are the main characteristics here. The flavor follows suit and adds some warm alcohol, a hint of sherry-like oxidation that just enhances the flavor. There are also some sweet cherry notes to round this out.
Medium-thick texture along with some prickly carbonation. This is definitely one of the best quads out there, if not THE best. I will have to drink a bottle of Pannepot to decide which is tops... 906 charactersNittanyBeerFan, Dec 12, 2011

Appearance: opaque, coffee brown, tan, one finger head that lingers. Great lacing
Smell: malts rush in with chocolate in their wake. Belgian yeast and dark fruits bring up the rear.
Taste: Chocolate dominates with Belgian yeast sliding in for a very smooth finish. Molasses lingers on the tongue. Didn't really taste the alcohol, but I knew it was there when my head began to fog up. 
Mouthfeel: medium; chewy. Heavy carbonation. Love to let this one sit on the tongue and gestate.
Overall: A bit pricey, but an immaculate sipping beer. Perfect for those cold nights. Glad I finally got to try this highly ranked masterpiece. 652 charactersbrewskifan55, Dec 11, 2011

A: Pours a murky brown with hints of red..mahogany, I guess. Just about a finger of off-white to tan head, dense. Some light, soapy lacing and a cap that's just a thinner version of the original head..pretty dense for a cap.
S: Oh boy. Rich caramel, plum, fig, raisin, clove, slightly peppery. Very nice. 
T: Bready, caramel, dark fruits mentioned in the smell, molasses, clove, banana maybe...slighty smokey in the finish. Very, very tasty.
M: Slightly chewy with a hint of alcohol burn. Warming.
O: This is an excellent, delicious beer and one that I'm glad is available locally. The alcohol is pretty understaded so this is very drinkable and could get you in trouble if not careful. I'll buy this again, no doubt about it. Thanks Tyler..you're a real doll. 826 characterstitosupertramp, Dec 10, 2011

As the beer settles into the snifter-inspired vessel, a dark smooth liquid emerges with a decent cap of foam. The color of the beer is dark chestnut brown. After allowing the brew to catch its breath the aroma is unmistakable. The alcohol is certainly noticeable, but it is mitigated by so many other things: burnt sugar, prunes, cloves, pear, chocolate. The complexity is demonstrated in the waves of the aroma. These characteristics come alive on the palate. The beer is much nimbler than expect and even manages some prickly carbonation. A bitterness pervades the entire experience providing balance to this Behemoth. The wonderfully melded components provide a deep rich flavor that is distinct and complex. 808 charactersBeardedBoffin, Dec 08, 2011

Drink by: 02/16/16; Poured in a snifter.
A - Very dark, murky brown in color with a slight garnet hue; Two inches of light tan, frothy, finely carbonated head that leaves some lacing around the glass; Head has pretty nice retention
S - I pull out new aromas with each sniff - awesome! Notes of dark fruits like raisins and plums, cherries, pepper, toast, dark chocolate, molasses, cloves, and grapes; Very faint alcohol burn in the nose
T - Big, rich flavor here with lots of dark fruits up front, followed by warmth from the alcohol and a peppery taste; Afterwards, I get more dark fruits with molasses, sugar, caramel, toast, grapes and a little tartness; Flavors stay with you long after the sip, and they're very pleasant
M - Full bodied with low, but zesty carbonation that tingles the tongue; Very smooth and creamy mouthfeel; Slight tart and dark fruity coat left in the mouth, leaving it feeling pretty dry; Just a small hint of alcohol taste, but the warmth is much more noticeable
O - Rochefort 10 was my first ever Quad, and I'm truly convinced that it's one of the best beers I've had to date. The taste and mouthfeel of this beer seem perfect to me, making it very challenging to sip this at an appropriate pace. The smell may be a bit on the light side, but it's still very nice, with all aromas coming together harmoniously. Definitely take your time with this beer and enjoy the complexity that it brings. I can't wait to have some more of this beer in the future, and also try other offerings in this style.

I really liked the way this one looked. The aroma was nice with a lot dried fruits dominated by plums and figs. The taste is just exceptional, a little more sweet than the aroma would lead you to believe and the alcohol is very well hidden. The mouthfeel is great, a bit on the heavy side but goes down smooth and very sticky. Overall a fantastic beer I don't know what else to say that hasn't already been said. Defiantly going to be picking this one for special occasions in the future. 617 charactersDan3279, Dec 04, 2011

No trappist glass on hand so poured into old reliable, aka my Delirium tulip glass, so it really poofed out the head. It's all there - sugar, rummy raisin - but no sticky mouth, nothing lingering that shouldn't linger. It's a boozy beer but one that makes you feel like you can drink a few in one sitting. (You probably shouldn't.) An adult beer. I nursed this on its own while playing Super Mario Bros with my niece and nephew but could easily pair this with beef stew. An all-time fave. 532 charactersMrELovesBeer, Dec 03, 2011

4.42/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5From the bottle, the dark color revealed immediately the standard of a quad. Giving an easy aroma of licorice, it was sweet candy to the senses. The initial taste was a sweet candy flavor that was well balanced with a warming tartness. The flavor combinations made the beer not too sweet or too tart. The warming nature makes this an ideal beer for a warming a cold winter day. On the other hand, sipping the bottle with a friend or friends could also be ideal. With a thick texture, there were hints of prunes, grapes, and other sours fruit that touch the palate as the aftertaste fades. The flavors are certain able to keep the tongue entertained as the thick texture stays in the mouth. This is a beer that can be tasted well after swallowing. 746 charactersJohnnyHopps, Dec 03, 2011
4.47/5  rDev 0%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5This 330 ml bottle was purchased at Pere Marquette Expeditions in Ludington, MI for $7.19. The best by date of August 18, 2015 indicates that this is a fairly fresh bottle (at just over a year old). Don’t these monks know that the world is ending in 2012? The bottle was poured into a Duvel tulip glass and served at 50 degrees Fahrenheit. A careful pour yielded two fingers of khaki-tinted head. Retention is moderate. Lacing clings to the glass with each sip. The color of the brew is dark brown, closing in on black.
The aroma blasts forth with loud decrees of raisin and licorice. It smells alcoholic, but nowhere close to what I’d expect for 11.3% ABV. It is rich for sure.
The flavor is pure decadence. Intense sweetness leads the charge with literal impressions of maple syrup. The aforementioned raisin and licorice manifest behind the sappy goodness, providing some nice depth to the proceedings. A mild vinegar sensation is detected but is not a detraction from the whole. Yes, it is alcoholic, but again, not nearly what you’d expect from 11.3% ABV. The alcohol also doesn’t have that candy sugar impression that I get from a lot of Belgian and Belgian-style ales. It is really quite a marvel.
The mouthfeel is full bodied, yet the viscosity is not terribly thick. The carbonation level is low to moderate. Though this is the easiest drinking beer of its strength that I’ve sampled, the alcohol does warm a lot on the way down the throat. That makes it a sure fire sipper, as a large swig would surely induce a gag reflex. 
Overall this beer is a very positive experience. It is expensive and it’s not the easiest drinking brew at the bottle shop. But let’s face it; this isn’t the kind of beer that is going to be a daily driver. This isn’t even a dessert beer. It deserves to be enjoyed all by itself with a fresh palate to appreciate its subtle nuances. Dare I say that 330 ml (approximately 11.2 ounces) is even plenty big to split with a friend.

A - Pours a dark brown, almost black, with hints of red. This poured with a massive three-finger, creamy tan head. The head retention was fantastic. It took forever for the head to completely dissipate. Nice, thick lacing stuck to the side of my glass.
S - The aroma is quite complex on this beer. It starts out sweet with lots of dark fruits (raisins, figs) and sugars. Hints of chocolate are present. The alcohol is not hidden here. As the beer warmed, I found the aroma to become more malty with a nice caramel smell.
T - Dark fruits and sweet malts dominate. It's peppery a bit too. The alcohol stings you at first but then smoothes out into the aftertaste. 
M - Medium-to-full bodied with minimal carbonation. A nice creamy texture exists. As mentioned before, the alcohol stings a bit but is quickly mellowed out. 
O - An great, complex beer. It's a sipper but very enjoyable. Not something I would drink on a regular basis but great to have once in a while. I haven't had too many Quads recently so this was an excellent choice to get reacquainted with the style. The price tag wasn't horrible either. I paid around $6-$7 for the 11.2 oz bottle. 1,239 charactersMahlik, Dec 02, 2011

4.79/5  rDev +7.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Classic c- lassic style dark quad ale from Belgium, and this is a winner. Opened up with some good smoke and poured a good brown with a tan creamy head. I just went head to head with St. B 12 and I think this baby won on flavor as well. So I upped my taste results to a 5!!!!
Strong complex aroma that waifs out of the glass that is rich heavy fruits, burnt caramels, and maybe a little oaky, earthiness.
Well, the taste is powerful. Rich real dark Belgian taste. Heavy sweetness creamy mixed with a high alcohol that kicks nice. Good tiny Belgian carbonation mixed with a little bit of bitter for a dark rich nice sweet glow on the tongue. Brown sugar tastes. 
This beer deserves respect. I suggest you drink it while watching an excellent French or Belgium (Jupiler League) soccer match. Quality fast moving soccer that involves athleticism, deep forward passes, and goals. Pairs well with the music of Milo Fine "Ananke." 927 charactersfrankiepop, Nov 30, 2011

Pours a dark brown that is not see through. Over two fingers of thick, light khaki colored head are produced. 
Dark fruit (fig and raisins) join with candied brown sugar. There is also some bready malt and a touch of alcohol. 
WOW! Very sweet burnt sugar come first, but then are mingled with several flavors. The dark fruit is very complex, with cherry and grape coming together with the fig and raisin noticed in the nose. Aftertaste leaves the sweet malt on the palate and the alcohol is very well masked throughout.
Full bodied with a creamy carbonation. 
Overall, this is one of the very best Belgians I have had. The smell is just a bit light, but the taste is second to none. 727 charactersfatmcb1, Nov 30, 2011

4.2/5  rDev -6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Haven't had a Quad in a long time, but I here this is one of the best.
A 330 mL bottle poured into an oversized wine glass.
A very dark brown with a small white head.
Sweet candied raisins on the nose, booze.
Wow. it starts slightly tart followed by a wave of candied dark fruits. Alcohol warming on the finish compliments the sweetness and is very subtle for its 11.5%
Silky smooth. Not heavy, but full bodied. Sexy.
This is one of my first Quads in a long time and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I could never drink these on the regular, but I'll be back when the mood strikes. I plan on picking up another to sit on for a few years. 629 charactersdbmernin83, Nov 29, 2011

A- Pours a massive bubbly, wheat bread colored head. Head bubbles down leaving lacing. Below the cap is a opaque brew. Color is a cross between a dark brown and deep violet. Some bubbles present near surface.
S- Strong dark fruit presence. Mostly plum, raisin, dates, and figs. There's a big swing to rich milk chocolate after the fruit. There's also a distinct red wine aroma in here as well. Underneath all this is a heavy malt presence and slight booze. A world class nose. 
T- Sweet fruits mentioned in the nose. Raisin initially but strong plum pulp takes over. Heavy malt presence with bready undertones and syrupy sweetness, not cloying though. Some heat from the booze also. Some age would more than likely mellow this out and put it over the top.
M- Thick, full bodied chewy beer with medium carbonation. As the beer warms this actually becomes easier going down despite the booze. You are forced to sip though to savor.
O- When I first decided to pursue trying different craft beers, this was the first one I tried. It was delicious then and it's delicious now. A six-pack of this would be perfect, and maybe one every six months would be interesting to see how this develops. If you get multiple of these try your best to sit on them, it will be worth it. 1,301 charactershaazer, Nov 29, 2011

Smell: Dark fruits, very sweet smell, some roasted malt, pungent alcohol smell, some caramel or toffee notes as well
Taste: Similar to the nose, very sweet, strong alcohol flavor, dark fruits, roasted malt.
Mouth Feel: medium bodied, sticky yet dry, someone what bitter on the finish.
Overall: This was a really good beer. Only downside for me is that I am not accustomed to such high abv in a beer and so it took away from my enjoyment just slightly. I enjoyed all the flavors and just wished there would have been less alcohol. I think I might enjoy the Rochefort 8 more. 663 charactersCrundy, Nov 25, 2011

Despite the darkness you can still see the carbonation towards the top. Head settles down thin but sticks around. Small bits of lacing are left on the glass.
It is very pungent with sugar, dark fruit, and alcohol. 
I picked up a bit of alcohol in the nose, but it was pretty well hidden for being over 11% when drinking. The alcohol does provide a nice warmth to your mouth. A little sugary malty aftertaste. Big raisin and fig flavor.
It is creamy, smooth, with a medium body, and a small amount of carbonation. 
A magnificent brew. 705 charactersMattSweatshirt, Nov 22, 2011

4.73/5  rDev +5.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A: Pours a very dark brown with some red notes, can't see through it. A two finger khaki head slowly dissipates, but never goes away completely. Surprising amount of lacing for a beer of this ABV.
S: Smells quite vinous right off the bat. Sour grapes, but with a rich malt backbone is the initial impression. Dark fruits covered in sugar. Plum particularly stands out for me. I get some green apple in the background. As it warms, I get very noticeable fig notes.
T: First got to mention that the alcohol is masked very well, and it can only be felt and tasted just the slightest, but blends with the beer gloriously. It is quite fruity. I also get a good deal of fig and raisin. Super well balanced. It never turns into a sweet mess even though I can taste the belgium candy sugars the more and more I sip. 
M: It coats the mouth really well, but still retains a softness. I would say medium-full in the mouth, and slightly sticky, but at the same time dry. Perfect small-bubbled carbonation keep this beer lively in the mouth, love it!
This is my first time having an authentic Trappist quad, and I have really enjoyed this one. Side note: the bottle I have was aged for about a year and a half. 1,201 charactersiDrinknewglarus, Nov 20, 2011

The aromas of dark fruit (figs and plums) are noticable up front with a hint of spice behind. The taste follows the nose, but with a slightly sweet edge thanks to the alcohol. The beer has a great weight in the mouth and a nice long finish. One my wife and I always turn to when we want a pick me up or to celebrate. 370 charactersstollio, Nov 20, 2011

4.75/5  rDev +6.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5It has a hazy dark brown coloring to it. Light passes through only at the edges of the glass. There is a slight reddish/orange coloring to it. When poured a half inch tan head forms. It’s a thick head made up mostly of tiny bubbles and it fades slowly to a film on the top of the beer. There was some nice lacing in the glass. 
The smell starts off with a noticeably appetizing strong fruit scent. It consists mostly of dark fruits, but I detected a hint of pear or apple. It’s followed with some spicy hop scent and touch of anise, especially as it warms to room temperature. Surprisingly the smells cover the scent of alcohol for the most part. 
The flavor is an amazing combination of dark fruits and molasses that mixes with a caramel malt taste that is absolutely incredible. The finish brings out some of that anise taste along with figs and a touch of oak. The flavor combination completely masks any taste of alcohol. It finishes clean with a smooth mild sweetness. 
This is a medium bodied beer with a creaminess to it that coats the mouth. It has the perfect amount of carbonation, some bite on the tongue, but not enough to be distracting. This is a very easy to drink beer. One needs to be careful because of the high 11.3 ABV it could be easy for someone to over indulge accidently. 
This beer has risen to the top ten favorite beers I’ve ever drank. This is so delicious and easy to drink that I could see myself going out of my way to find bottles of it. I wouldn’t recommend more than one or two in a night. If you have a chance to get your hands on one, do yourself a favor and buy it. I can easily see myself sitting back on a chilly Fall, Winter or Spring night enjoying one by a fire with friends. 1,729 charactersContagion, Nov 20, 2011

Melds very nicely. Yum. The taste is sublime - dark fruits, plum and suggestions of grape again mirror the nose. Minimal booze and finishes a bit dry. There is just a slight bit of a mildly unpleasant finish, but that is being picky. Having had several, my guess is that it goes away after being cellared. The mouthfeel is velvety, low carbonation, good body. Overall, this beer is really good and shows that not everything that is good has to be hard to get. 575 charactersseeswo, Nov 16, 2011

4.23/5  rDev -5.4%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Bottle brought back from Nova Scotia about 2 years ago by my girlfriend, 330ml bottle shared as part of the QuadShowdown. 2009 vintage. 
Pours a deep red/burgundy, with a fairly white head. Light retention, with a tight collar and thin film. Good clarity in the body. Nose has some alcohol, brown sugar, prunes/figs, a rich malt character and a light herbal/vinous note. Taste has a beautiful profile, dark fruits, sugars, fantastic malt notes. Some wood, a light sweetness (maybe vanilla-y) and some spice in the finish. Mouthfeel is lovely, extremely velvety and smooth - excellent all around. Flavour and mouthfeel on this put this up there, an excellent beer really. 671 charactersliamt07, Nov 13, 2011
2.64/5  rDev -40.9%look: 4 | smell: 2.5 | taste: 2.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 211.2oz bottle into tulip snifter.
Pours a very dark brown. When held to the light has lighter brown edges and a haziness becomes apparent. Has a foamy tan head of about a quarter inch that has great retention.
The nose is sweet with dark sugars, tart apple, and a yeast backing. Faint alcohol in the backing.
The taste is of brown sugar, dark fruit and light yeast phenol. There are also some tart apple notes in the finish as well as an alcohol burn.
The mouthfeel is full bodied with low, yet prickly carbonation.
It has some nice qualities, but the ABV is not well integrated and by the end of the glass is incredibly dominant, I just wasn't impressed overall. 668 charactersvkv822, Nov 12, 2011

This pours a dark brown with a large tan head which dissipates down to a thin layer. The smell is a little lighter than expected, it has some dark fruit, dates, plums, brown sugar, very wintery. The feel is medium with high tinglely carbonation. The taste is pretty good, a little sweet with the fruit and sugar, on the way down there is a little alcohol burn and a little dryness, overall tasty. 439 charactersDavidST, Nov 12, 2011

4.19/5  rDev -6.3%look: 5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Bottle purchased from Friar Tuck's in Savoy, IL.
Poured into a St. Bernardus chalice.
Pours a 1.5cm light tan head of very fine bubbles that sinks to a 0.5cm ring around the glass, along with very large swirls of foam islands. The effect is something like a yin-yang in my glass. Body is very dark brown, impenetrable, with orange-ish highlights. Opaque, so no carbonation visible. An excellent looking beer.
Scent is actually a bit minor, primary aromas of brown sugar sweetness and ethanol.
Taste is, on the front of the tongue, of sweet, heavy maltiness with spiced prunes, dried figs, raisins and dates. Moving back a bit, I detect brown sugar, rum, and anise. What hops are there are used to prevent cloying. Ethanol present on back of tongue, but not crazy hot, and well balanced by malt backbone. Aftertaste of dates in a syrupy liquor.
Mouthfeel for this beer is velvety smooth, medium-heavy in body with just noticeable carbonation. Just a bit of warmth from the ethanol in the back of the throat, pleasing with the heaviness of the beer. Finish is a little syrupy, not particularly dry.
Overall, this is as of right now my preferred quad. A very complex sipping dessert beer and a pleasure to partake of. 1,219 charactersfalloutsnow, Nov 10, 2011

I opend the less then 12oz bottle and poured into a glass a murky brown color, the darkest of the big trappist beer. I smelI is slightly boozy and sweet yeast. The taste is strong upfront but super sweet and fruity on the end.

A - Poured dark brown with big creamy off white head that slowly dissipated leaving lots of lacing around the glass.
S - Mostly bready yeast with hints of dark fruits and caramel.
T - Starts off sweet due to brown sugar and honey. Then bready yeast, malts and dark fruits take over. The finish is a little boozy.
M - Full bodied with high carbonation.
O - Superb quad with ABV held in check by flavors. I highly recommend it. 455 characterstaigor, Nov 09, 2011
4.35/5  rDev -2.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Poured into my Duvel glass after letting it rest out of the fridge for 20 minutes and has a very deep burgundy, brown color with a light tan lacing on top. The aroma is huge on this one of sweet figs, fresh plum maybe, sugar and almost a light port aroma. The taste on this starts with just a bit of carbonation then takes off. I like that the sweetness powers its way to the front then quickly fades to an alcohol heat and last a bit of a malt finish. This is so incredibly smooth, I can not over state this. The finish is almost velvet like even at close to room temp. A very good quad that very closely lives up to the hype. 627 characterslonestar4lunch, Nov 09, 2011

4.35/5  rDev -2.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Appearance Served in a glass goblet is a brown almost black ale with a rich 2 finger pearl-white foam top. The bottom of the bottle is covered with black muddy lees.
Smell Fruits, many many fruits, mostly dark ones like plums and wild cherries but there’s also room for some ripe bananas too. Although well hidden there is a hint of alcohol.
Taste This is a complex, intense and dense flavor pack. A malty and extremely sweet brew sprinkled with Lübeck marzipan and chocolate.
Mouthfeel Heavy body, thick liquid, loads of carbonation. The liquid’s smooth but the lingering is a nibble to the tongue that stings a tad. 625 charactersTobiasGoth, Nov 05, 2011
4.6/5  rDev +2.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5I'm, drinking and rating this beer side by side with the Trappistes Rochefort 8
Appearance-It's a dark brown that shows alittle purple in the light. Opaque but a lovely color.
Smell-Once the beer settles the aromas arise, pear, plum, a sweet malty scent. The strongest smell is raisin. 
Taste- 3 part taste... 1st it hits with proper carbonation, the sugars and fruit taste, mostly plum and raisin... 2nd the alcohol brings with it the malty taste... 3rd it finishes with a smoky aftertaste that is met with the perfect mouthfeel of the beer.
Mouthfeel-Just a smooth beer, not much else to say there.
Overall-A perfect Belgian, if I may say so, not as sweet as the 8, better bodied and more pronounce carbonation and raisin taste than the 8. I definitely love these beers. 777 charactersjulian89, Nov 03, 2011
4.6/5  rDev +2.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Poured in to my new goblet I bought today and I'll be dammed I picked it just the right size. With a healthy pour I get a creamy tan head that floats above the rim of the glass with out pouring out of the glass. Some sticky lacing all around the glass. Deep brown with a hint of some ruby when held to the light. A little cloudy from the yeast partials floating around. This beer looks full bodied!
The aroma is rich with dates, plums, molasses, and sweet alcohol. There is a hint of honey wheat bread from the malt and the yeast. 
The flavors are rich with ripe fruit. Just like I explained in the aroma. Plum, dates, sugar, rum, and sweet alcohol. Grand slam on the taste buds! Some hops pull through as well in the end.
Slick on the tongue, full bodied, sweet, and a sipper. There is no rushing this beer. And that is a good thing. 
All I can say is... damn this is a really good beer. 892 charactersLuigi, Nov 02, 2011

Nose is slightly sour and sweet; woody, with cocoa and hops.
Taste is rich, with sweet malt and dark chocolate. Cola and raisins. Very biscuity with a smoky, alcohol finish.

Murky chestnut brown with a dirty eggshell color head that dissipates soon after pouring. Then disappears. No head for the duration of the session unfortunately. Some legging as the beer is drank down. 
Raisins and candied figs are the most forward on the nose. Behind that we have a distinct booze smell similar to rum, with some toffee and Belgian candy sugar. The alcohol really tickles your nose and becomes more apparent as the beer comes up to temp.
Opens with rich toffee and raisins. Moves further into a touch of chocolate, spice, and yeast. Dessert bread qualities like nutmeg and a rum glaze. More of that nice Belgian candy sugar and figs. Pretty complex and much better than the nose.
Medium body with moderate carbonation. A tad sticky and some heat then tingle from the booze.
Great fruity raisin and fig character with some spice, toffee and chocolate, booze to compliment. A great, available authentic quad. Definitely world class in some regards, but could use a head. But who cares how the beer looks in the end? 1,170 charactersauroracrisis, Nov 01, 2011

T: grape and cherry come through with notes of candi sugar, very well balanced, some tannins in there on the finish, dry at the end, great balance, very complex flavor

4.32/5  rDev -3.4%look: 3 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4A: Murky brown, looks like mud, no head whatsoever. Not very appealing, but it looks like every other quad that I've had.
S: Smells of big dark fruits: plum, dark cherry, and fig. A little caramel coming through too, but it's feint. Smells are all a bit more subdued than I expected, but the actual aromas are nice.
T: What it lacks in appearance and aroma, it makes up for in flavor, big time. Everything in the smell x20 is in the flavor. There is a bit of a booziness to it, but not as much as you'd expect for an 11%+ beer. This is a great quad.
M: This is thick, full bodied - almost chewy but not quite. Carbonation is on the lower side in the moderate spectrum. Mouthfeel is dead on and perfect.
D: Hah, it drinks easily, but if someone pounds this they should be slapped. 783 characterstlazaroff, Oct 30, 2011

Poured into a Claret..
Appearance-Very murky, muddy brown color. Plum like. Head is just a creamy, frothy beige head that is just incredible considering the ABV. About 3 fingers leaving incredible lacing.
Smell-At first the aroma is very subtle but then it really opens up. candied dark fruits galore. Plum, Raison, Cherry. Also some hints of pear and peach. A different aroma in ever sniff. Brown sugar and just tons of sweetness, burn sugars.
Taste-Sweet burnt sugar upfront then just an array of those fruits and spice. Towards the middle I the alcohol started coming through but it wasn't too overbearing. The finish is great b/c the alcohol really gets masked. It kind of lets you know its there, then leaves. Pretty amazing. As it warms just big time brown sugar. A great desert beer or just for a nice cold night.
Mouthfeel-Creamy, Smooth. Perfectly carbonation and just full bodied. So easy to drink.
Overall-Completely on par with Rocheforst 8, maybe better. Just a beautiful perfectly balanced beer that could be consumed any time of the year or day. Damn, i'm glad this is in Texas now. 1,183 charactersSWMeyer4141, Oct 29, 2011

A: Pours a dark brown with a nice tan head that fades to a ring and leaves no lacing on the glass. 
S: The nose is amazing with perfect notes of brown sugar, caramel, and that belgian clove/yeast aroma. About as good a nose on a Quad as I've ever had.
T: The taste is equally great with the same notes as the nose along with a nice vanilla flavor. The brown sugar and belgian yeast reallys sets this apart.
M: The feel is creamy and medium bodied...the carbonation is a tiny bit too bubbly but for the most part it's good.
O: This lived up to it's reputation and I'm glad it's back in Texas. I plan to enjoy this on occasion because at $7 a bottle and the ABV it's not an every day drinker. 724 charactersGregSVT, Oct 27, 2011

Aroma offers dark fruits with a lot of complexity. Raisins come through, as do plums and grapes. It is sweet smelling with a light yeast scent. 
The taste starts out strong with dark fruits and sweetness, and finishes with a bit of bitterness and yeasty flavor. Figs are more present in the taste than in the aroma. Not a very boozy tasting beer and it is dangerously drinkable! 
This is my favorite quad. I have tried many of them, including Westvleteren 12. I love the complexity of this beer...I will continue to keep it as a staple for years to come. 639 charactersMsRif, Oct 25, 2011

T/M - Wow! This is good. Complex. Bready maltiness with caramel notes. Raisins and plums. Spicy finish and aftertaste. The alcohol is deceptively balanced, but does become prominent as it warms. Creamy mouthfeel with just some mild carbonation.

Fruity yeast character. Sweetness blends to an earthy fig and raisin finish. Drank this over the course of an hour and a half.

S: When first opened has a similar smell to a toasted lager. After i poured it into a snifter the smell of fruit became much more prominent. 
T: Can definitely taste the alcohol. But it is masked by a yeasty taste with hints of dark plum, raisin. As it is allowed to sit longer and gets warmer has more of a honey/sugar taste
M: Had a creamy feel as it warms. Initially has a strong sugary feel on the tongue that softens to a fruity aftertaste
I really enjoyed the complexity of the beer. Would consider it one of the better beers I have every had. Certainly one of the better of the trappist beers. 745 characterscorsendonkfan, Oct 22, 2011

S: Lots of intense fruit aroma, mostly grapes, apple, pear, raisins, and a little bit of plum. There is some caramel, a bit of sugary sweetness, and some bready malt. 
T: Fantastic. Lots of sweet malt mixed with dark fruit, caramel, a little molasses, and some brown sugar. Similar fruit to the aroma - grapes, raisins, apple, pear, fig, and plum. 
M: Extremely smooth and easy drinking. Medium bodied, no sign of alcohol at all.

4.22/5  rDev -5.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5I've been drinking beer for a long time, but I never really ventured into the Trappist beers because I never really liked the style of the yeast from Belgium. Because of the availability of this beer at most places, I gave it a shot. If you are used to the California Russian Imperial stouts or any of the craft brewed stouts, this one is going to be different. It’s not as pitch black, but has brown coloring notes in it. The smell is going to be different as well, more fruity. The flavor profile is well pretty insane, lots of things going on from beginning palate to well after you have swallowed. An incredibly interesting beer with that for me, again for me only, has that yeasty style that is sometimes off-putting. 
If you are more of a California style stout drinker this one will be very complex, interesting and almost studious, however it is different and might not be what some people think when they imagine a stout. 933 charactersdonovanneb, Oct 21, 2011
4.18/5  rDev -6.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A: Dark brown. No light comes through. Tan head that's really fluffy and delicious looking. Good retention.
S: Rich dark fruits. Roasty aroma with definite brown sugar notes. The alcohol cuts through though.
T: Really rich malty flavor combined with molasses. The phenols are present throughout. Very light smokiness I think. I do think it's boozy throughout though. My palate adjusted to it as the beer warmed and I finished more though.
M: Really big mouthfeel. Thick and lightly astringent.
O: It's incredibly rich with big flavors. I wish it wasn't quite as boozy. But still great. Bet it would be great aged. 617 characterstony223366, Oct 21, 2011
4.2/5  rDev -6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured into an oversized Bordeaux glass. Poured with a massive fluffy head that had some serious staying power.
Smells super sweet like brown sugar and a hint of chocolate.
Taste is very malty, not what I think of when I think of a Belgian beer. Has taste of brown sugar and bread. Tastes of dark fruit and a touch of fennel. It drinks really, really thick. Very creamy and surprisingly only medium carbonated. This beer has a hot taste as it starts to get near room temperature.
Overall, an extremely expensive beer that warrants the price. If you like stouts, I think this beer would be pretty assessable. 610 charactersuawildcat, Oct 21, 2011
4.08/5  rDev -8.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 411.2oz bottle with no freshness date. It is 11.3% alcohol though...so who cares.
Pours an extremely murky reddish-brown color. You can see little to no light through this beer. Fluffy two finger beige colored head is still hanging around at one finger tall after 5 minutes or so. Moderate lacing being left behind as I sip on it.
The aroma is fairly clean and mild for such a big beer. Some ripe fruity notes, some brown sugar, and a bit of alcohol. 
Deceptively smooth taste! Just a touch of bubbly carbonation up front. This alcohol really hits the top of your mouth as you swallow, but this beer is incredibly balanced out by a big fruity and malty sweetness. Just a hint of alcohol in the finish.
Medium, bordering on full bodied mouthfeel with moderate carbonaiton and just the right amount of alcohol heat.
One of the best Belgians that I've had overall....period.
Morey's Bottom Line: I'm not going to lie....I haven't had many Quads. All I know is that this is one tasty Belgian, and the alcohol is really well hidden. I paid a hefty price for this bottle ($9.99), but I might have to do it again sometime. 1,120 charactersMorey, Oct 19, 2011
4.55/5  rDev +1.8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4.5Bought a 11.2 FL. OZ. - 330ml bottle of this from Hair of the Dog in St. Louis, MO for $7. Poured from the plain & simple cream colored bottle with a blue "10" on the front into a 16oz Pint Glass. Has 140715, 09:45 on the bottle as well.
Aroma- Very complexed... Not sure if I can put into words everything in here, but here it goes! Very rich malts start it off with nice roasty and toasty background. Has a bit of booze but not too much for the style. Has some type of fig and/or fruits that play a big part in the background. Almost has all the attributes of a barleywine, without the extreme booziness. Enjoyed coming back to this aroma over 10 times (but whos counting ;)
Appearance- Pours a 2 finger head that is off white and stays very bubbly for quite some time. Has a deep, coffee like color body (amber could be in here but darker than this) and slightly hazy. Leaves nice lacing afterwards. 
Flavor- Has an extremely strong caramel flavor from the beginning that has a nice boozy finish. Very complexed, bodied, and goes down surprisingly smooth. May have a dry finish as well but the ABV's didn't let you forget who was boss in this one! 
Mouthfeel- Full Bodied, Medium Carbonation (wish it was higher), Smooth with a big Creamy finish, and leaves good alcohol/booze on the palate (very nice!). 
Overall Impression- Enjoyed every last drop of this one! You could pour this over some Vanilla ice cream and make a Trappistes Float it was that good! Very nice brew and am ready to try the other two from Brasserie de Rochefort. I would go for this one if your looking to get into more Belgian style beers. 1,620 charactersDCon, Oct 19, 2011
5/5  rDev +11.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5My Fave!!! Pours deep brown with a thin head and good lace. Smells like malty dark fruit. Taste is a mind blower. Dark fruit, rum raisin, banana, booze, brown sugar, apple butter, yet not overly sweet. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. A bit oily and chewy. Not too carbonated. It is hard to describe how this brew EXPLODES on the palate with such complexity, so much going on. So many sweet nuances, yet not cloying. Finishes surprisingly clean and dry for such complex flavor. This is by FAR the best of it's style I've tasted. Stunningly good. 544 charactershombrepalo, Oct 18, 2011
4.69/5  rDev +4.9%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Poured nearly black. Upon further inspection, appears a dark tobacco color with little head, no cover on top of the brew. Rich chocolate aroma meets your nose first, then figs, raisin, other dark, juicy fruit and some toast with a swirl. Dark chocolate, a little bitter, meets your taste buds first, followed by raisins, date, some plum. A bit of alcohol bite becomes more prominent with each sop. The chocolate flavor lingers, a pleasurable, creamy flavor. The feeling of silk is a good description of this beer. Tiny bubbles and lots of carbonation really balance it out.
This is a truly complex beer. I've noticed some things since writing down my observations on beer, and most of them have to do with yeast. When I compare this beer to Unibroque's offerings, I understand why so many flock to Belgian creations: the yeast. It has to do with so much of the flavor, nose, and feel of the beer. Yeast touches all of the aspects of a beer, and Rochefort has a dynamite strain. When I added a little yeast to the beer after a swirl of the bottle I got more of a fruity flavor. Amazing! Very impressed with this beer, in that the complexities come with ease. I have a feeling I'll update this review at a later date when I am able to observe more aspects of this interesting creation. 1,284 charactersPhilousa, Oct 17, 2011
4.1/5  rDev -8.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Appearance: Cloudy, mahogany color with a huge head that fades slowly with fluffy lacing.
Aroma: Hay over raisins, with some hints of plum and molasses. Its slightly medicinal yet has a clean, wheat malt-like aroma to it.
Taste: Very creamy with a ton of sweetness upfront, then it gets a little hot in the middle, before more syrupy sweetness on the back end. There is a mild fruitiness that comes in and out while drinking, and the finish is quite boozy.
The Rest: I recently had Rochefort 8, and I liked the 8 better. While still very good, 10 is just starting to cross the line into being too boozy. 606 characterscurasowa, Oct 17, 2011
4.82/5  rDev +7.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5330 ml bottle poured into a Leffe chalice.
Pours very dark with just a little light brightening the edges of the beer. Fairly aggressive pour resulted in about two fingers of cream colored head that dissipated pretty slowly.
Aroma is very pronounced. I could smell the beer as soon as I poured it from about two feet away. I get dark fruits on the nose, mostly raisins, dates, figs.
Taste is true to the aroma. Lots of dark fruit, with slight hint of banana, some caramel or toffee as well. Mouth feel is very rich. I can still taste the beer about a minute since my last sip, and my mouth still feels coated. Alcohol is not noticeable at all to me, despite being over 11%.
Overall I think this beer is phenomenal. I have avoided Belgians in the past, but either my palate has changed significantly, or I have finally found one that I really enjoy. Tough to find this near home in MD, so I'm glad I could sample while I'm here in NJ. 937 charactersmtalley999, Oct 13, 2011
4.5/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Bottle served in a goblet.
Appearance: Pours a creamy chocolate color with a light tan head. 
Smell: Fruity aromas dominate with smells of cherry, raisins, and even a faint hint of banana. The malty aroma are present as well in the background and hints of biscuit, caramel, and even a faint smell of chocolate in the background.
Taste: The flavor is very malt forward with a spicy yeast finish. The malt flavor is extremely complex with flavors of biscuit, caramel, and a hint of chocolate sweetness. The finish is fruity and spicy. Dark fruits such as cherries, raisins, plums, etc. The spicy aspect is difficult to put into words.
Mouthfeel: Surprisingly light bodied for such a huge beer. The high alcohol is well contained and shows up as a gentle warmth as the beer runs down your throat.
Overall: A truly spectacular beer. Waves of complex flavors and aromas hit you over and over. Virtually indescribable - must try. 928 charactersagomega, Oct 12, 2011

S: dark fruit, caramel, brown sugar and some malt.
T: Lots of dark fruit up front with molasses, prune and hop bitterness notes. Finishes with a relatively strong alcohol flavoring. 
M: thick body with a very oily finish. High carbonation.
Overall: I am not a fan of this genre but I will grade it based on how it is within its genre and not personal taste. I appreciate the fruitiness which is not overwhelming though the booz is a little strong. 537 characterskylehay2004, Oct 12, 2011
4.87/5  rDev +8.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Bought this brew from my local beer shop and poured into a glass. this has a great compact head with a nice light color and a hue of ruby red. Smells of raisins and fig and you can get a tinge of alcohol in there as well. The taste is one of dark fruits and honey. The slight taste of alcohol blends nicely into the mix and is not overpowering at all. Very pleasant taste in general. Very thick mouthfeel but one that suits the style very well. It's velvety and smooth. Carbonation is moderate and fits in well with what i was expecting. I think i'm in love with this beer and will be buying at again for sure. For 5.99 its well worth it. 638 charactersRhynes2, Oct 10, 2011
4.43/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured into an Old Guardian chalice, sampled side by side with a Westy 12. 
Appearance: Pours out a very dark mahogany color with 3/4" of light khaki colored head. Retention is pretty decent, and lacing is mostly non-existent.
Smell: Very different on the nose when compared to Westy 12. Much more emphasis on dark fruits (raisin, fig, date) with much less sweetness. Rochefort also has a dankness to it, a bit cave-like and musty, which I find unexpected. The requisite yeast and spices and present as well.
Taste: Superb here. Some caramel and toffee up front, but that is quickly overshadowed by copious amount of rasin, fig and date. Yeast and spice is also detected, and a nice but muted phenols.
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, moderate carbonation, and an extremely smooth and pillowy mouthfeel. Very good. Overall, I preferred this to Westy 12. Less sweetness and more dark fruit presence and complexity. And it's exponentially easier to find to boot. 957 characterszhanson88, Oct 10, 2011
4.42/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.511.2 oz bottle served in NOLA snifter
Brown hue, ruby red on the edges. Thick light tan head that dies quickly, leaving some lacing behind. 
Dark fruits, black cherry, raisins, very vinous. Nicely spiced. The nose on this is incredible. 
Candied sugar, black cherry, apple, raisin, and very vinous, followed by a smooth vanilla taste at the end. Peppery throughout, the alcohol only makes the spice that much stronger. Taste lingers on and on thankfully. 
Coats the mouth nicely, moderate to heavy carbonation, leaves a nice peppery tingle behind for quite some time. 
What an incredible beer. It is truly an experience to drink this beer, and gladly it is always around. Incredibly complex and easy to put down at 11.3% ABV relatively speaking. 751 charactersBrahnSolo, Oct 10, 2011

A - A very dark brown beer with a very nice beige head. The withdrawal of the foam is slow, beautiful to watch. There is a reasonable layer of foam remaining nearly a finger thick. 
S - An inviting aroma of chocolate and cherries come towards you. You can smell that this is a heavy beer. 
T - What a great taste, sweet and bitter tones complement each other nicely. Chocolate tones, cherries, figs, cardamom, nail powder, coriander and sugar candy. 
M - Soft carbonation and slightly sticky. The bitterness and alcohol warmth come in the end. 
O - A beautifully complex beer with great taste and still very drinkable. The alcohol is present but never in a bad way. 766 charactersMar02x, Oct 08, 2011

Mahogany brown color with a thin light-tan head that settles quickly. Carbonation continues to rise to the surface, little bubbles seem to emerge constantly from the murky depths.
Aroma is dark fruits and sweet brown sugar. Plums and prunes and sugary dates.
Taste is dark sweet malt, candi sugar, dark stone fruits. Complex but well integrated. Alcohol expertly concealed.
Mouthfeel is smooth and balanced w/ a bone dry finish.
Overall a world-class Belgian quad, little fault to be found with this beer. 
(Note: This was a side-by-side with Westvleteren 12 and I found this beer to hold its own, just ever so slightly less impressive on the aroma and mouthfeel.) 744 charactersdraheim, Oct 07, 2011

5/5  rDev +11.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Pours a nice deep brown. Very dark brown in glass with a ring of light head. Wonderful flakes of sediment floating around in the glass. In the sunlight, these are much more apparent.
Smell is a great combination of dark fruits, brown sugar, spice, molasses, vanilla, caramel. Taste is the same. A hint of a peppery sting also. Very creamy and delicious. This is a wonderful beer. Alcohol undetectable in the taste but not in the mind, especially if you drink too fast, which is easy to do.
This is better than Westvleteren 12 but due to Rochefort's wide distribution and ease of purchase, I think westy continues to receive higher marks because of its legend and extremely limited availability. Do a blind taste test and judge for yourself. 742 charactersBowman2001, Oct 05, 2011

What a beautiful smell. Huge doses of yeast and chocolate. Malt sweetness and herbal/earthy scents too. 
Rich, full, and complex flavor. Dark chocolate raisins. Toffee. Mellow and dry. Wonderful combination of sweetness and full, Belgian yeast. Creamy. 
It's everything a quad should be. It represents a great beer times four and drinks like a combination of as many styles. 466 charactersbirderbeerer, Oct 03, 2011

N: SWEET. Caramel, Figs, Dates, Fresh bread, Alcohol/fruity tones. Vanilla and molasses.
M&T: Full bodied. Silky. Very nice carbonation for a trappist with this high ABV. Taste is following the nose. Sweet and fruity. Caramal, Figs, maybe plums. Roasted malt. No bitterness from hops. In fact, were is the bitterness here?

Lots of yeast swirling in this one. Nice Tan head that sticks around for awhile which kind of surprised me because it had such a high ABV. I was really impressed with the appearance in this one.
S= First thing I picked up on the nose was Figs. I also got some bread crumb aroma and some toasted malts. Overall though it was a very Sweet nose.
T= Taste is similar to the nose the dark fruits really come out in the taste (figs,dates,plums). Alcohol is pretty well hidden by the dark fruits and toasted malts. Really good taste on this one.
M= Full bodied. Good carbonation 
O= Overall very impressed by this quad one of my favorite quads really interesting and I couldn't beat the price I picked like six of these up for like $3 a piece IMO a great deal. 860 charactersLiquidBread219, Oct 02, 2011

A - pours a deep mahogay with a khaki colored head - about three fingers but dissipates quickly. Leaves behind a smattering of foam on the top with a little collar of foam around the edge of the beer's surface. 
S - caramel and brown sugar aromas mingling with dark fruits. Just a hint of booziness but certainly not overwhelming. At this ABV, that's a feat. No hop character of any significance that I can detect. 
T - On the front, not as flavorful as I expected. But it moves to the back of my mouth, it opens up in a very nice way. Belgian yeast and dark bourbon type flavors. It's sweet and malty but not cloying in any way. On the finish, it's surprisingly....crisp isn't the word, but not as heavy as I would have expected in the flavor. I did notice the slightest bit of alcohol burn on the finish. There's a lot of flavor going on here but all of the flavors blend well and present in a very nice, if very big, package. Definitely warms you as you get toward the middle of the glass. Again, no significant hops. 
M - medium/full, leaning to the full side. Not overly carbonated, very mellow in that respect. It's got a silky mouthfeel and the carbonation is just enough to make it well balanced - it keeps it from becoming syrupy. 
O - overall, a big, flavorful beer that I very much enjoyed. This is the first quad that I've tried, and I will definitely give it another shot in the future. 1,448 characterslawlerj, Oct 01, 2011

S - Malty malty malty... with rum about bourbon sprinkled throughout. This is probably because of the abv. Spices and fruit notes come through as well. 
T - Malts to the forefront with caramel and coffee notes towards the end. 
M - A little over-carbonated for my taste but is very hearty and doesn't hold back.
O - What a great quad! This is not a session but one you want to practice patience with. 526 characterscvm4, Sep 29, 2011

Smell -- Very sweet smelling, a nice yeasty dough. You could plan an evening around just smelling this beer.
Taste -- Very nice, very complex. There is some sweetness, but it is balanced against a very aggressive peppery/spicy punch that to me is the real personality of this beer. There's mild bitterness that's very complimentary to both the sweetness and the pepper.
Mouthfeel -- Silky smooth, but also viscous.
Overall -- outstanding beer.
Notes: This is outrageously good. But it is also extremely heavy. Very much a sipper. I shared the 12 oz bottle with my brother, and to be honest, 6 oz seemed to be enough for a serving. We had the beer solo, but when I have this again, it will be much better with a cheese. If you have it with a meal, you'll be more likely to want the whole 12 oz bottle. High ABV at 11.3%. 875 charactersKBBA, Sep 27, 2011

A - Pours almost pitch black with a dark murky brown hue on the edges, finger of head which quickly dissipates and leaves no lacing.
S - Rich toffee and caramel, ABV heat is detectable, sweet rum and bourbon notes.
T - The sweetness is subdued by the ABV heat. Surprisingly I'm detecting some earthy hop notes, and the sweet rum and bourbon flavours come through nicely, alongside some dark fruit flavours.
M - Medium bodied, goes down surprisingly smooth given the ABV heat, but certainly detectable.
O - A tasty Quad and well worth picking up. I'm definitely a fan of the flavours, reminiscent of a barrel aged ale. Pricey but a great treat. 694 charactersandrenaline, Sep 25, 2011

BB 01/12/15
Rochefort 6 is one of my favorite beers, however I thought the 8 was very disappointing - not sure what to expect from this one. 
Appearance: Wow, Rochefort 10 is much darker than I expected - it looks a little like Pannepot. 
Opaque (tons of yeast haze) extra dark brown body topped with a good sized ivory coloured head. Sadly the head does not last well or leave good lace, but the beer leaves great alcohol legs on the glass. 
Smell: Mmmmm, my first whiff lets me know that I am not going to be disappointed by this beer. 
Sweet dark fruits dominate (raisins, figs, red grapes and dates), golden raisins, dark caramel, chocolate, rum, spices (cloves and pepper) are also well noted as well as touches of red wine, vanilla and molasses. 
Taste: Superb - massive flavour and insane complexities. This seems like the perfect dark Belgian. 
Dark fruit (raisins, dates, plums and figs), spices (cloves and cinnamon), dark caramel, golden raisins, red wine, rum and a touch of chocolate. 
Alcohol is noted, but is an integral part of the flavour. 
Mouthfeel: Just less than a full body, slightly sticky with a high level of ultra smooth carbonation. I could drink this all day. 
Overall: Superb beer! I will be having this again and again and again! 1,339 charactersThehuntmaster, Sep 24, 2011
4.26/5  rDev -4.7%look: 3 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5poured into a goblet. dark brown with minimal translucent colors when held to the light. Little head... about 1/2 in. that reduces to nothing rather quickly... no lace... wonder if it is my glass, but i doubt it. 
Smell is dominated by dark fruit... dates or fig, with currant cherry. slight alcohol aroma towards the end as well a defined yeast profile throughout. smell is more like a wine than a beer but still very good. 
taste is good.... dark fruits start out then subtle alcohol warming with light malt characteristics. yeast is a player in the middle of the palate but is subdued by a resurgence of alcohol flavors... but in a good way... dark fruits linger with a light tart taste... no real hop flavor.
good mouth feel that lets the taste absorb into the palate... high carbonation
Overall a very good beer... maybe in my top 5.... maybe... still want to try a westy to see if it stacks up like people say it does... 930 charactersDUBinMIA, Sep 20, 2011
4.63/5  rDev +3.6%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Review #100
A - Dark brown with tones of ruby red and plum accompanied by a half inch of tan head that settles to a thin layer. Little lace, but looking nice overall.
S - Raisins, figs, other dark dried fruits. Slight notes of rum alcohol, but very subtle. Toffee and butterscotch, malt forward for the most part. Spicy Belgian yeast is prominent as well.
T - Oh, boy. Pretty much everything from the nose, minus the rum, plus much more. Alcohol can be pinpointed, but not to 11% territory. Sweet fruits are dominant- dried figs, prunes, raisins. Rich layers of sweet caramel malts, toffee, and fruits, one after another. Sweet overall: pleasant, not cloying. Again, Belgian yeast esters are very present and absolutely tasty, providing a rich and diverse combination of flavors. One of the best tasting beers I can recall having in quite some time.
M - Smooth and velvety, nearly perfect carbonation. Sweet alcohol coats the mouth for an instant, warming in the gut on the way down. Doesn't feel as big as it is... Nice.
O - Like I said, one of the tastiest beers I've had in a while. I've had it before, and it's better than I remember. This one was sitting in the cellar for a good 6 months and the alcohol seemed to tone down quite a bit. A phenomenal beer overall, and one that I would recommend to any craft drinker, newbie or veteran. A pretty standard 100th review beer, but I'm glad this is the one I chose. 1,421 charactersBonis, Sep 19, 2011
4.42/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5As I've worked my way recently up the Rochefort numbers, 6, 8, I've enjoyed them but kept waiting to be blown away. And now I have. 10 is a 10.
Poured a 2" mocha colored head. Body is dark like a glass of cola. Smell is thick with fig, dried fruits, malt. Taste is a complex delicous combo of fig, dried fruits, cola, toffee, caramel, and things I can't really name. It's rich. There's a long finish with a little alcohol burn to it from the 11.3% alcohol but yet it still doesn't seem too hot. It all works together like one of the bourbon barrel aged beers, but without the bourbon of course. A classic. 606 charactersMoreThanWine, Sep 16, 2011

The pour is a dirty dark brown. Amazing head for being 11% ABV.
The smell is full on brown sugar. Slight prune and molasses but brown sugar takes the forefront. 
The taste is similar to the smell. High bitterness on the front from the alcohol. Then a slimy sweet prune puree type taste as it goes down.
I've had the other Rocheforts and this was my least favorite. I should also mention it is about a year old from bottling. 497 charactersEriktheipaman, Sep 16, 2011

T: The smell continues into the flavor, Toasted malt, tropical fruit, brown sugar, earthy hop, alcohol, even a slight pez-candy flavor. Some yeasty bread and alcohol aftertastes.
M: medium-heavy body, high carbonation and burn from the alcohol.
O: Doesn't get too much better than this. Everything about the beer is outstanding. The flavors will change as you drink the beer and they are all great. 635 charactersKromes, Sep 15, 2011
4.62/5  rDev +3.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5330 mL bottle poured into a chalice. Bottled 2/16/2011.
Appearance - Murky brown body that has the slightest red tint to it. You can't see much through it, though. A surprising khaki head on top that seems to die down and come back to life every time I move the beer. The lacing is substantial and also fascinating to watch. The swirling patterns are like Rorschach tests.
Smell - Yeasty aromas that manifest themselves as bananas. Lots of dark fruits of every variety. Amazingly complex and delightful aroma, perhaps a bit overpowered by booze.
Taste - It just doesn't get any better than this. The flavors that come across are just amazing. Raisins, plums, figs, and an estery banana flavor to bundle them all together. Again, the booze is prevalent, but it's nice. There's even a slight bitterness at the end and I don't know where it comes from.
Mouthfeel - Full bodied and warming. The alcohol burn is present, but still appropriate. It's a little bit dry in the finish.
Overall - This tastes like some age would make it unbelievably good. Toning down the alcohol would put this at world class in every category. Of all the beers readily available year round at the stores near me, this is the best. 1,209 charactersAlieniloquium, Sep 15, 2011
4.3/5  rDev -3.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5The modest off-white head on this beer settles down quickly but leaves lovely lacing, very creamy, sticks around and hangs on the sides of the glass. Very dark brown beer with a faint reddish hue.
The smell is of malts, booze, and dark fruits like plums, figs, etc.
The taste is a very complex mix of sweetish malt, fruit notes, and alcohol. Very little bitterness or hop presence but it's still a very balanced flavor that doesn't go over the top in terms of sweetness. Not cloying in the least.
Long, creamy, full finish full of complexity; relatively low carbonation. Lingers beautifully.
Have to say never having had the opportunity to try Westy that this one sticks out as my all time favorite Belgian/Trappist beer. Although I may have to revisit some others for a quick reminder...St. Bernadus Abt. 12 is a contender too. 832 characterstobelerone, Sep 14, 2011
4.3/5  rDev -3.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Bottle into a cervoise goblet.
A: Pours a dark brownish purple, like a dirty grape, with lighter hues around the edges. Quick tan head that subsides into a nice film ring.
S: A little boozy with some slight dark fruits. Raisins and figs. There is a nice sweetness at the backend that rounds it out.
T: Nice dark berries on the tongue. Raisins, blueberries and figs all present. A sugary sweetness takes over from there which is really nice. There is some slight toffee or caramel as well. Finally there is a little heat that warms the throat.
M: Creamy and smooth. Nice carbonation with some nice sweet berries left on the palate.
O: Delicious. I really enjoyed every aspect of this beer and the dark fruits played off the sweetness nicely. Will revisit many times in the future. 784 charactersTreebs, Sep 13, 2011
4.38/5  rDev -2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Going into my first tasting of it, this baby had more hype than LeBron James did on draft (draught?) night.
Poured from a bottle bought in Paris into a snifter (did not have a goblet on hand :-/).
Paired with Roquefort cheese (thought it was fitting).
A - Poured pitch-black with a high khaki head. Looks damn impressive behind the golden rim and writing of my "Gauloise" stemmed snifter. Head leaves some lacing, but not as much as one would expect.
S - Smells like a bowl of fresh berries that have been left out to ferment with some sugar.
T - Order of flavors that I detected: Caramel. Cherries. Roasted malts. Rum. It opens with a smooth, candied sweetness that fleets into a bubbly bitterness. Does not disappoint, despite the hype. I'd prefer it to be less sweet, but that's just me being nitpicky. Definitely not TOO sweet. The strong alcohol taste lingers, but not too much for a beer of its alcohol content. I've definitely had some that finish off with a taste of death. This one is pleasantly strong. Reminds you that you're drinking something that gets you drunk. 
M - Moderately bubbly. Very smooth. The feeling on the back of your throat as it goes down is sort of like a diluted rum (in that it's smooth, but invokes a slight burning sensation - but obviously less so than an 80-proof rum does).
O - I just drank a bland lager before this (Fischer). It's a little bit like watching Kanye West open for Bob Dylan. Or rather, it's more like when you see a beautiful woman with real womanly curves and distinctive, though unusual characteristics, who reminds you what is lacking in our prepackaged culture. Immense depth to this beer. I definitely understand why this babe has such a rep. Not a beer that I would drink every time I get off work or finish a long day of school, but definitely one to savor.
It's strong though. I'm kinda drunk now. 1,867 charactersTRICKYD1CK, Sep 12, 2011

Smell: figs, alcohol, and dark fruit.
Taste: sweet malts, Belgian yeast, warming alcohol, more dark fruits.. all masterfully crafted. Also, the Rochefort 10 doesn't have the faint metallic taste I detected in the St. Bernardus 12.
Mouthfeel: full bodied with a smoothness that is second to none.

4.12/5  rDev -7.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured from a bottle into a goblet. 
Appearance: Pours a cloudy reddish dark amber. There is a half finger of off white head. Leaves a thin layer of head with a little lacing.
Smell: Quite sweet with strong dark fruit notes, I'm picking up some plum. Malty with a brown sugar smell, not a whole lot of spice from the yeast.
Taste: Reminds me of a barley wine, a very good barley wine. Lots of brown sugar and dark fruit. There is some smooth alcohol in the finish along with a very mild bitterness.
Mouthfeel: Medium body with mild carbonation and a slightly dry finish.
Overall: Also really good. Reminds me more of a barleywine than most quads I have tried, but I really loved it. Definitely will have this again. 720 charactersoline73, Sep 11, 2011
4.56/5  rDev +2%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Small off-white head that disappears quickly, leaving very little lacing. Dark copper to reddish brown color.
Smell is dried fruit coupled with caramel sweetness. A little earthy and a german style hop character. Spicy notes that can only be descibed as "Rochefort".
Dark, dried fruit come again in the taste. Sweet for sure, but not overwhelmingly so. A small nutty character and some chocolate. Again the typical and unmistakeable Rochefort taste.
Feels perfect in the mouth. No overcarbonation and despite the sweetness no heavy-weighter.
A true masterpiece. A perfectly balanced beer that stands out with its own truly unique taste. 640 charactersRapax, Sep 09, 2011

4.36/5  rDev -2.5%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Bottle poured into my Chimay chalice.
A: Pours a deep luscious brown with a twinge of Burgundy, with an thick lively off-white head on top. Moderate sized "pancake batter" bubbles have formed from side-to-side across the Chalice. 5.0.
S: Moderate nose of vanilla cream sweetness and dark frutes. 4.0
T: Taste follows the nose. It begins as a belgian brown ale, with delicate malts on display. A creamy vanilla quickly rises in the mouth. This is the most dominant of all the flavors here. On the back end, "belgian dark fruits" (dates, prunes, figs) make there presence known. There is a mild element of bitterness both at the beginning and the finish on this beer, that help round the overall experience out and keep all of these sweet oddities in check. 4.5
M: The "creamy" phenominon here is impressive. This beer just whisks away in your mouth, in a way that no other that I have had does. Amazing. 5.0
D/O: This is a great brew, with a strong flavor profile and an incredible mouthfeel. Overall, however, it's just a touch too sweet for my liking, and I'll have that reflect with a drinkability/overall score of 4.0. I will definitely have this again, many times, but I don't think I'd opt to have 3 all in one evening. 1,229 characterspsuKinger, Sep 05, 2011
4.52/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from bottle into a snifter.
Appearance - A deep earthy brown that lets no rays of light through. Tiny carbonation bubbles that are hard to make out through this almost opaque brew. Lots of yeast swirling. Head started as two fingers and quickly diminished.
Smell - Brown sugar and dark fruit like that of raisins and black cherries. Molasses and licorice. Warm alcohol and yeast to cap it off. A lot of smell to process. 
Taste & Mouthfeel - The alchohol/carbonation fire caught me by surprise. Not in a bad way, it just required another sip before I could taste it. Very complex: Fig, raisin, plum, molasses, pepper. A whole meal in itself. Very smooth and dry. Little to no after taste. Medium-full in body. Warms from the back of the tongue down to the belly then back up to the face.
Overall: Magnificent. Very well balanced brew that can be enjoyed over the course of an hour or two that grows in flavor as it warms. I wish I had some cheese to go with this fine specimen. 988 charactersEricMichael, Sep 05, 2011
4.95/5  rDev +10.7%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5A - Thick, tan head that stuck around for at least a half an hour
S - Figs and vanilla
T - Smooth, with complexity driven by dark fruit flavors balanced by vanilla and a sweetness that wasn't cloying
M - Very good - nothing to complain about, neither thick or thin, but balanced towards thin like a good quad should
Overall - this might be my favorite Belgian. I have many Westy's around the house as a result of a long project in Brussels/Leuven, which allowed me to collect a few bottles. As much as I want to enjoy the Westys, I think I prefer the Rochefort 10 I acquired here. I had Rochefort beers in Belgium, but they were really hot. Buying it here, after at least a month floating on the Atlantic and trucked around from who-knows-where have smoothed it out considerably. 780 charactersescapegoat, Sep 03, 2011

S- smells of sulfur, solvents, dark fruit, and alcohol. super complex but the sulfer overwhelms.
8/11- smells fantastic, bread, pepper, spice, dark fruit, raisns, zero alcohol and no off flavors.
T- damn that is good. Dark fruit fig, plumb and burnt carmel, very good.
8/11- sugar raisn, bread, coke, chocolate, with a little funk. really nice. super duper complex.
M- great level of carbonation and an even coat on the mouth, very nice and refreshing, wish I had some good french food with this one.
8/11- warming, great carbonation iwth a nice creaminess, spot on.
D- This is a great beer, not in my top 20 but in the top 100 for sure. Aged it for about 9 months as well so the alcohol burn was not there at all. Pretty darn good.
8/11- World Classic, this tasted better the second time, (a years more worth off experience under the belt too). Is insanely drinkable, and as it warms it gets even better, no solevent flavors the second time around, this is now a top 10 beer for me :)

4.2/5  rDev -6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4(A) Dark, murky brown. Lighter brown toward the bottom of the glass. Pretty nice, tan foamy head on it that hangs around for a decent while.
(S) Dark fruits, some raisin, figs, plum, cherry, lightly roasted malts, earthy and some slight booze?
(T) Pretty sweet. More of the plum and figs hits up front with dried dark cherry coming in as well. Belgian candi sugar. Some banana and raisin play a role here. Some cereal. The raisin and fig come out more and more as it opens up and warms. This definitely used some decent malts and had a grain bill that was heavier on the residual sugars. The sweetness is big, but it's surprisingly not off-putting like beers can get with being overly sweet.
(M) Medium body. Pretty well balanced with body and carbonation. Very smooth brew.
(O) Does NOT drink like an 11% beer at all. It's a well balanced, obviously-not-American beer that sits well as a Quad. It's not a Westy 12, but it's quite up there being of the style. This one could easily sneak up on you though. This goes down rather easy for being such a big brew. The sweetness is enough to keep you from reaching for too many. 1,127 characterscjacobsen, Aug 24, 2011

S - Soy sauce? I'm not sure but I am definitely getting a salty-fruity aroma out of this bottle. Darker fruits are definitely present in the nose. The alcohol is detectable, but that is to be expected at 11.3%.
T - Dark fruits. Fantastic taste of plums, figs, and raisins. I also am getting some of that saltyness that I smelled. Delicious!
M - It fizzles on the palate with each sip. Also has a somewhat dry finish. Medium-full bodied brew. 
O - Maybe my expectations for this beer were too high. Maybe it is hyped up too much. The taste was fantastic, but all around I thought this beer was lacking. Don't get me wrong, this is a fabulous brew, but St. bernardus Abt. 12 is still ranked as the #1 Quad for me. At $6.50 per bottle, I don't think I would buy this beer again. 939 charactersstevenstofen, Aug 17, 2011
4.37/5  rDev -2.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured into a tulip. color is very dark amber with no haze. There is a thin creamy looking head covering the liquid.
The aroma is full of fruity plum and raisin. There is a nice malty bread crumb aroma.
The taste yields brown sugar and cinnamon, with lots of malty crust. This is perfectly sweet, but not too much so as to cover up the malt characteristics. There is a slight bit of heat in the finish.
The body is just larger than medium. The carbonation is quite lively for the ABV.
This is my favorite quad thus far. I would recommend it to anyone. 555 charactersandrewinski1, Aug 16, 2011

It's dark. Poured into a Chimay goblet it's got proper head and a brown to red tinge at the sides of the glass. The smell is crazy. Like plum pudding. Chocolate, burnt fruit, dried fruit, overripe fruit, figs, dates, and sweetened citrus. Rich.
The taste is similarly rich. Dark fruits take over and the malty sweetness is matched by the yeast. No hop notes, but who needs them? Rochefort 10 is medium to full body, thick and creamy.
This 2010 bottle will undoubtedly only get better with time, but I'm still glad I ordered it. 
Plus the girl finished the 11.3% beer, and she was the one who needed it anyway. 804 charactersafksports, Aug 16, 2011

4.72/5  rDev +5.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Bottle date 260116 - means it was only bottled this past January, so pretty fresh. Let's give it a try anyway.
Pours a dark reddish-brown, some orange highlights. Generous off-white head.
The smell is dominated by fruit - raisins, prunes, that sort of thing. Some of that distinctive Belgian yeasty smell in there as well. Alcohol is well hidden in the smell.
The taste is a bona fide parade of flavors. At first sip, or second anyway, I'm getting everything from bananas to nutmeg. Definitely more on the spice as I keep going. A little bubblegum. Some alcohol bite - not surprising with this being such a young sample. A little toffee/caramel, but not as much as I was expecting with this being such a dark rich beer. There's even a bit of that "earthy" or "musty" flavor one gets from fresh Continental hops, but I might be just tricking myself into detecting that one.
Mouthfeel is rich but not overwhelming. Again, a bit of an alcohol bite.
Overall, I cannot deny that this is a world class beer. That said, I think it would benefit from more aging than I allowed on this bottle - I'll have to find another. 1,117 charactersErrto, Aug 14, 2011

A: Pours that typical, murky Coca-Cola brown with a frothy, tight-bubbled tan head. Tried to keep the yeast in the bottle and failed. Once the head dies it's easy to revive, but there isn't much lacing to speak of.
S: First smell is acidic dark cherry, which blossoms into some other fruits like plum and prune. There is a woody character here, and hints at vanilla as well. Lots of spicy sweet yeast esters.
T: Again, those darker fruits (with plum and prune being most dominant) and a lot of oak presence right off the bat. There is some chalky cocoa flavors, and some vinous qualities followed by just the slightest hint of alcohol heat.
MF: Creamy and smooth really, medium bodied, and not too much carbonation, just enough to spread the beer across your tongue and palette. 
O: A nice quad, quite drinkable at this stage (I think it's right around a year and a half old). The floaties usually bug me but here they didn't detract from the taste and feel too much. Recommended. 1,038 charactersScotchboy, Aug 13, 2011
4.7/5  rDev +5.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A - Pours a dark, thick brown with rosy highlights. Not much head to speak of, but that's the be expected. Lots of sediment in the bottom of the bottom as I pour.
S - A little boozy, but mostly lots dark fruits: figs, cherries, raisins, etc. It's an incredible smell, especially for 11%. 
T - If I thought the smell was complex, the taste blows that away. The dark fruit is there very strong in the taste, but there's a hint of booziness, rich caramel malts, a hint of chocolate, banana. Each sip is a different flavor.
M - The carbonation is spot on, it's not very aggressive, fairly mild, but enough to coat my entire mouth with the flavor. The flavor dissipates with time, leaving different aspects of it as it fades.
Overall, this is an outstanding beer. Though experience doesn't necessarily make a beer good, in this situation, I trust the monks on this one and they did a heckuva job. 895 charactersgdrydenc, Aug 13, 2011
3.69/5  rDev -17.4%look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5Very excited about this one! This is probably the only beer that has mocked me the most every time I walked into a beer store due to its high price. Let's hope that it's worth all the hype it's received! This was poured into a chalice. Freshness date is listed as 01/09/15.
Appearance: Pours a typically dark reddish color for a quad. Maintains a decent, small head for the most part, although I expected it to be much thicker. Carbonation looks plentiful.
Smell: Wow. Where to start?! Extremely fruity, resembling raspberries, cranberries and raisins. There a funky herb smell in there as well, perhaps a little bit of clove as well. However, the extra sweetness in the aroma clearly comes from the very high alcohol.
Taste: My God, this is great! The booziness is very, very apparent here, but I'm getting so many flavors at once that I'm unable to contain myself writing this review. Raspberries, grapes, caramel, cranberries, roasted bread grains and other sweetened varieties. This IS the quintessential sipping beer, and I'm going to be very respectful with it the whole time.
Mouthfeel: Wonderfully smooth - this beer has no bitter end to it AT ALL. There is wonderful chewiness and creamy feel to it, definitely due to the high amount of malts. One sip of this thing instantly warms me up, and the sweetness lasts on the tongue forever.
Overall: This beer isn't a Trappist for nothing! Drinking it IS a true religious experience. One of the best sipping beers on this planet, PERIOD. Deserves all the attention it gets, and makes me not want to ever put any extra effort into finding a Westvleteren 12 any time soon when I have this and St. Bernardus Abt 12 to brighten up my horizons.
Update (2/10/2014): The latest batch I've had to date is not doing too well - thinned, buttery (possible diacetyl), and with too much booze that overpowers its malt profile. No clue what's happened, but during a quad tasting with jdhowe and others, it unanimously decided that it was the worst tasting one. 2,006 charactersmagictacosinus, Aug 12, 2011

A- Dark mahogany with a lot of yeast sediment. 2 finger tan creamy head post pour but this reduces to literally nothing quickly with no lacing.

M- Low/medium carbonation, full body
D- Heart sank again post pour. Not sure if i have maybe stored these Rochefort beers poorly or if they are too old. Poor appearance and flavour/aroma profile. Had this a few years ago in Cafe Gollem in Amsterdam and was blown away. This is definitely not the same beer. 747 charactersseanyfo, Aug 11, 2011
3.97/5  rDev -11.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 2.5 |  overall: 4appearance Dark dark brown or light black. It cant be seen through but there is a light brown glow on the edge. Very foamy tan carmel head. 2 inch thick head
Smell- Cherry with a little malt. maybe a light smell of burnt malt. bourbon rolls off at the end.
Taste- earth tones with malt and barley showing through. There is a fruity side to it as it sits on your tounge.
mouthfeel- chew through it. It is thick. I also think the Alc. level really influnces this beer. I actually think it takes away from it at some level. The carboniztion feels fine. Just some heat going down.
Overall- I wouldn't go out of my way for it again but I am glad it is off my list.
I just had it with a slice of Tillomock smoked cheddard....Really good 734 charactersisualum12, Aug 09, 2011

S-Candied dark fruits,grapes, spice, malt, sweet burnt sugar, and alcohol.
T/M- Malty for sure. Syrup, brown sugar come out right away with a mouthful of booze. There is a touch of fruit and a nice caramelized sugar taste. Quite easy to drink once you get past the initial hit from the abv.

4.97/5  rDev +11.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5From an 11.2oz bottle into a stemless red wine glass(my favorite glass for sampling something I know is worth drinking slow and allowing to warm in my hand).
Pours amazingly dark, can barely see light through it, after struggling to see, I note it is a tad cloudy( I didn't pour it myself, they may have not been as careful as necessary), I do notice a good layer of sediment left behind in the bottle. Has a strong 1/4" head, cream/tan that has good retention and lasts through about 2/3 of the glass. Very light carbonation visible.
Smell is heavy with dark fruit; fig, plum. Malts are present on the nose as well.
Taste doesn't disappoint, it is beautiful to the tongue. Still heavy with the dark fruits, a slight bitter malt, and a nice bite of alcohol thanks to the 11.3 percent alcohol. As it warms the alcohol gives more burn and the fruit really pulls through to the point of resembling wine.
Mouth-feel is thin and clean in a metallic way. Probably simple elements of the water used. Leaves bitter, fruit and grainy alcohol on the back of the tongue.
This is an excellent beer to compliment good company and great conversation. Drinks like a fine wine. Well worth the money spent, cannot wait to have another! 1,223 charactersLadyOfMuchBeer, Aug 08, 2011
4.77/5  rDev +6.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Probably one of my most favorite beers of all time.
Poured it from the bottle into a goblet
Appearance: Dark color (dark like coca-cola), good head.
Smell: Amazing. Has a dark dried fruit bouquet with a little bit of sweetness.
Taste: Extremely concentrated taste of dark dried fruit (Prunes, raisins, dates) that has been soaked in alcohol.
Mouthfeel: Long lasting aftertaste of dried fruits
Overall an exceptional beer that is worth seeking out. 451 charactersrslomin, Aug 08, 2011

Poured from a 11.2oz (330ml) bottle into a goblet. 
A: Pours a murky dark brown color with about 1 1/2 fingers worth of khaki, almost a light cream colored head. Head reduces to a fine cap, barely leaving any lacing and some noticeable alcohol legs.
S: Nose is a bouquet of dark fruits like plums, figs, and raisins. Brown sugar, a little bit of alcohol, and bready maltiness that brings all those nuances together. 
T: Taste is amazing! Rum soaked raisins, plums, and brown sugar. Alcohol is also present, but not over bearing. Big bready malts are very welcoming as well, great profile.
M: Big bready malts coat the mouth, tongue, and cheeks. Full bodied, good carbonation and alcohol help move the brew along. Overall a great example of the style.
Note: I drank half the bottle almost 30mins later, all flavors, nose, even mouthfeel were enchanced. 887 characterslazjuarez, Aug 08, 2011
4.38/5  rDev -2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5The most rare of the Trappistes Rochefort ales, 10 bears aromas that attest to its fine craftsmanship and aging: light and fruity citrus notes, such as orange, white grape, and berry; darker fruits such as plum and fig; hints of port wine; oak. 
On the tongue the citrus flavors are especially predominant, and so strong that it's difficult to imagine this being a beverage made mainly of malts and hops. Oranges and berries are especially present, as well as apples and pears. Hints of spice--coriander, perhaps cloves--dance wildly, mingling with candy caramels and vanillas. There is a fairly significant alcohol kick (thanks to the 11.3% ABV), but it does blend in, much like a particularly well-made cocktail. The aftertaste is largely a continuation of the above flavors, but lasts far longer than would be expected; in fact, it's lasted through my trying to think up something clever to say here, and failing utterly. 
Overall, this is a first-rate ale with hardly a fault to be found, and well-worth the price. 1,020 charactersjondeelee, Aug 08, 2011
4.05/5  rDev -9.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Abbaye de Notre-Dame de Saint-Remy's 2004-2005 Trappistes Rochefort 10 11.2oz from my cellar, into Delirium Tremens etched snifter. In low light, pours a very dark shade with a small 1/4th" head that disappears quickly not leaving any lacing. The oh so famous etched elephant in the base of the glass provides a nucleation point for carbonation to release, thus forming a incredible cap of foam about 5 mins after pour. The beer is so dark in the dim light that I cant see through, leaning toward a dark brown. Larger size chunks of yeast and protein float around near the bottom despite a soft delicate pour. Smell is very soft. Smells of grapes, plums, alcohol soaked dates, and a bit of brandy for me. The taste matches the nose, soft and delicate. White grapes are up front with assorted dried fruits, mainly raisins. The mouthfeel is strait up velvet. It is so smooth and so soft. Its weird how such immense taste can be paired with such a delicate presentation, but these bastards make it work. The alcohol is almost undetectable, which also means it is deadly. I have honestly had better quads, some of which are domestic, but this beer shines with its own astounding quality's. If I find it again for $4 a bottle, I'll be grabbing a few to cellar. Cheers! 1,263 charactersOhYesILoveBeer, Aug 07, 2011

3.65/5  rDev -18.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5Poured from 11.2 FL OZ bottle into chalice.
A- Deep chocolate brown. Aggressive pour yields a brief 1 1/2 finger head that quickly dissipates, leaving a creamy cap.
S- Sourdough raisin bread. Ripe figs and plums. Classic Belgian yeast. Tart cherries soaked in alcohol. Very inviting.
T- The front is spiced bread, raisins, molasses, red grapes, and a big licorice taste. There's a fair amount of carbonation that is almost immediately noticeable. The transition phase is almost all dark fruit - figs and grapes whose bitterness is emphasized by the unabashed alcohol. The aftertaste follows, being primarily dark fruits and warmth. There's a big alcohol taste in this one and is a bit wine-ish, but at 11.3% ABV I guess that's bound to happen.
M- Medium bodied. As mentioned above, the carbonation makes a surprisingly early appearance, not waiting for the transition like many beers do. Quite dry.
O- Overall this is an OK beer, but I found the alcohol taste to be a bit much. As one of the more expensive bottles at my local store ($6.50 for the small bottle), I can think of a few other quad options that I like more at a better price point. Worthy of another purchase; will try again in the future. 1,207 charactersseabass87, Aug 05, 2011
4.33/5  rDev -3.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.52010 bottle, served in an Orval chalice. The beer poured a cider-brown with a thin film off head that faded quickly into a light ring of bubbles around the outside surface of the beer. The nose was a sweet mixture of molasses, raisin/date/fig, light alcohol, yeast and a little malt. The taste was a wonderful melding of complex flavors. Spicy yeast, brown sugar, malt, the gamut of dark fruits, molasses and a bit of chocolate. The alcohol is there, but it's very well masked amongst the rest of the flavors. Mouthfeel was smooth, medium to full bodied with a good amount of prickly carbonation. This beer is a real treat which I need to remind myself of when I balk at the pricetag - well worth the premium price. 715 characterssurlytheduff, Aug 04, 2011
4.82/5  rDev +7.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5So, after many years of enjoying this fine brew, I am finally sitting in the comfort of my home and reviewing this highly regarded trappist ale.
The beer is brown with a nice, tan head. Decent lacing and retention. The aroma is inviting, with yeast, malt, caramel. It definitely smells like an amazing Belgian quad. Wow, what a flavor! The 11.3% abv is so well hidden, and this bottle is fairly new. Simply terrific. Balanced to perfection. It's been several months since I had last enjoyed a Rochefort 10, and I am suddenly remembering my fondness for this spectacular beer. Certainly one of the finest quads on the planet. 625 charactersHuhzubendah, Aug 04, 2011
4.42/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Appearance - Pours a dark brown color with a two finger light tan head.
Smell - Aromas of plums, raisins, and spices with a subtle hint of alcohol.
Taste - Almost fruity. Mostly malt and raisins.
Mouthfeel - Medium body, crisp, and smooth at the same time. The carbonation of some bottles was close to overbearing, but most of the time it was perfect. A little inconsistency there.
Overall - This is one of my "everyday beers". 431 charactersdvsbizzyb, Jul 31, 2011

S: Molasses, raisins, figs, caramel-like malts, brown sugar, and a hint of alcohol. Very pleasing and overall a very good aroma. 
T: Very similar to smell with a lot of dark fruits coupled with molasses and caramel. Not overly sweet, with the brown sugar notes nicely complimented with a slight bitterness in the finish. Alcohol disappears wonderfully in the taste. What can I say- an exceptional tasting quad.
M: Very good mouthfeel for the style with a thinner mouthfeel (considering the ABV) and a good amount of carbonation.
D: An exceptional quad style. Always willing to pick this up at stores, for the right price. A must try for those that haven't. 738 charactersDigimaika2, Jul 30, 2011
4.08/5  rDev -8.7%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5One of those beers that I've overlooked for far too long. 11.2 oz bottle into a chimay goblet. Can't find a date but the store sells quite a bit of belgians so I would assume its on the fresher side.
A - Deep cola colored body. Khakhi head that dissipates to some dirty edging and some solid lacing. 
S - Sweet malts, candied figs, and light spices. I can't put my finger on it, but there's this certain candy sweet herbalness going on. Very smooth and well balanced.
T - Same as the aroma. Sweet malts, dark fruits, spices and a dash of molasses. The mystery herbalness is there as well. Alcohol is present, but suprisingly low key. The mouthfeel is tremendously smooth and well balanced. 
O - I wasn't super impressed by the aroma and smell. However, the mouthfeel and body of this beer is perhaps the best I have ever experienced. This is a really well crafted beer, a real classic. 889 charactersdavey101, Jul 29, 2011
3.85/5  rDev -13.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4.5A: There is a deem caramel hue to it that almost looks more mahogany as the night wore on, the lacing from this character cascaded lazily from corner to corner of the glass with careless abandon. Some finger wagging should be administered to the lack of carbonation, but the appearance of this old scamp is too lovingly administered to really admonish in a serious way.
S: The smell has some deep dark fruits, the nature of which that I have rarely but let’s just call it figs, molasses (note: not a fruit), banana (not dark), and of course the old friend molasses rounds out the experience.
T: The taste has this amazing initial sweetness that lingers for a bit with a false hope that it will be a sweet stout that drops immediately into a depth of complexity inhabited by chocolate, caramel, and plums. Not necessarily in that order. Like barley wines, I have a sour disposition to this crowd pleasers but I must doff my well worn cap where it is due. Consider this cap doffed not unlike a newsies ensemble member: DOFFED.
M: Nice coating that doesn’t overstay its welcome but imparts some nice coating with chewy roasty nut and cherry notes. I hate to reach for the “nut” notes this early in a review but there you go, the nut is there. Just try to extricate it.
D: Well, time for a series of qualifiers paraded out ad infinitum. I think this is delicious, that requires no amount of qualification. However, most people may find its character overbearing and relegated to ski lodges. That is fine, I will take my arctic brethren around Wilshire, enjoy his presence in the summer sun, however, some people would find his graces unwelcome at that point. I must concede that any more than 16oz of this guy and it’s a bit much. However, if you love kicking it with monks, by all means, don’t let me tell you how to live your life.
Narrative: Coming this fall to UPN: “THAT’S MY TRAPPIST!” Inner city youth Reggie Jenkins never though life could get THIS DOPE until a real life monastic servant showed up at his doorstep with a vow of servitude: SUPER SICK! Now Reggie and Rochefort will OF COURSE have a series of misadventures wherein Reggie must integrate his Jesuit friend into the HOOD and Reggie might just learn a thing or two about himself along the SERIES OF 8 EPISODES.

4.75/5  rDev +6.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from an 11.2 oz bottle into a tulip. This is beautiful, appears a dark brown color with a thick, three-finger, brown head, that also has sudsy qualities. Leaves great lacing on the glass and has wonderful staying power.
The aroma contains wonderful caramel, toffee and dark fruits. Each smell draws you in for a sip. Very rich and inviting. The taste contains many of the same qualities, lots of dark fruit, caramel and some toffee hints. This is fairly sweet throughout each sip, but has a nice balancing bitterness towards the end. Finishes fairly sweet with a heavy caramel flavor. The alcohol is buried underneath the other flavors, all you get from the 11.3% is a warming feeling. This is wonderfully complex and flavorful brew.
The mouthfeel is medium to full bodied and has a perfect level of carbonation. Very creamy, yet has a carbonation bite at the end of each sip as well. An amazing feel. Overall, this is an amazing brew, one of the best I've had. Held off on buying it for a while, but honestly wish I'd had it earlier. Very impressed here. 1,064 characterszimm421, Jul 25, 2011

A: Very dark brown, almost black. Has a very slight deep red tint around edges when held to light. Finger and a half, thick fluffy, light tan head. After 3-4 minutes it hasn't receded at all. Super thick and sticky lacing.
S: Been smelling since I popped the cap. Huge dark fruit aroma. Figs and raisins mainly. Prunes and dates are lighter. Hints of vanilla and rum. A buttery bread/biscuit scent coming through. Awesome smelling.
T: Sweet, but not overly. Caramel and toffee malt, with a very mild roastiness. Figs and raisins in the middle. A mild bitterness, than finishes with an almost Black Licorice/Cherry aftertaste.
M: Full bodied. Low carbonation. Smooth, creamy, buttery. Light alcohol sting. Warmth all the way to the stomach.
O: Amazing beer. What else can I say? Complex. Sweet. Although you know and taste that it's 11.3% you just can't stop sipping it. Really starts to creep up on you. 946 charactersdoughanson78, Jul 23, 2011

A - Pours an opaque and hazy deep chocolate brown in the light, but near black in dimmer lighting. Two fingers of solid head that has good retention and leaves limited lacing.
S - Extremely strong smell, the second it poured, I could catch the scent invading my nose. A strong fig note is the first thing I noticed, but it gives way to a roasted malt, nearly stout type character that really distinguished this beer. 
T - The roasted malts are really evident here off the bat and it leaves that dark fruit taste on the backend. Almost the exact reverse of the nose. The yeast tastes a bit more buried than in other belgians, but it shines through eventhough the roasted malts steal the show and make for some really interesting dark fruit flavors. 
M - Heavy body, creamy, and yet still has a bubbly carbonation to it. 
O - A quality quad that qualifies for quenching the belgian palatte. The alcohol is slightly muted by the overall strength of the flavors that come through on this offering. 1,023 charactersWreckoncile, Jul 23, 2011
4.42/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Almost seems silly reviewing this beautiful quad. To describe it, is to describe what a quad should be. 
Pours a deep mahogany with a lovely tan pillow atop. Lovely aroma; brown sugar, fig, holiday baking, vanilla and i hint a booze. It's 100 degrees outside, but i feel as if a yule log should be on my television.
A surprisingly creamy, light feel on the tongue. Not too sticky. Not too chewy. Peppery spice leftovers for sure.
The taste is everything the nose has promised. Such a complex flavor that is dominated more and more by licorice as is warms. There is 11.3% percent alcohol in here somewhere, yet this quad seems much less booze dominated than the Rochefort 8 (9.2%).
I love this beer. It's why I love beer. 724 charactersiheartIPA, Jul 23, 2011

T: Booze prickle and dark ripe fruits. 
M: Good carbonation and semi thick. 
O: I think the 10 may have more smell of ripe fruits than the 8 but personally I prefer the 8. The 10 seems to have a little to much booze which takes away from the flavour of the beer. And the 8 is no slouch at 9.2% 463 characterslr99gt, Jul 14, 2011

A - the aroma is a bit wide, with dark fruits that have been dried under the sun to a bottle of rum that has been popped, raisins, prunes, cinnamon spices, VANILLA, bready malt that just exudes fullness.
T - a complexity that ascends to the highest of spectrums, a journey through a sweet fruitiness, under blackened prunes and flashes of delicately sweentened natural figs, nutty blueberry muffins. the toasted bready characters are absoultely divine to compliment the natually sweetening charcters that are intertwined .thoughout. the heat is subtle and warming
M - medium to full, coating and filling, a slightly fizzy feeling on the palate, shame on me. slight tingle on the tip of the tongue.
O - im not a big fan of belgian darks, especially dubbels but top notch quads have a place in my heart, this beer is absouletly amazing, not for the simple minded. a capturing complexity and intelligently crafted ancient recipe. drink it belgium. 1,311 charactersJayAre46, Jul 11, 2011

It is hard to describe how this brew EXPLODES on the palate with such complexity, so much going on. So many sweet nuances, yet not cloying.

4.59/5  rDev +2.7%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.511.2oz bottle poured into a tulip glass.
Appearance-Deep dark mahogany, a beautiful brown color with faint ruby highlights. Moderate clarity. Thin tan head has low retention, but the beer exhibits some legs.
Aroma-Positively intoxicating-Brown sugar, banana pound cake, molasses syrup, burnt caramel toffee, fig pudding, rich prunes-this beer is overflowing with intense and delicious aromatics. Theres also some definite fusels with a hint of heat in the aroma. The aroma is to die for.
Flavor-Rich, sweet toffee/caramel/brown sugar/molasses malt flavors up front with slight fruity figgy/prune flavors before drying to a warming black licorice/dark candi sugar flavor. Aftertaste is long, dry, and slightly fruity. Warmth remains on palate for an eternity.
Mouthfeel-Chewy, full body with moderately low carbonation and silky smooth texture. Substantial alcohol warmth is pleasant, and still manages to avoid being hot.
This beer kicks ass-a perfect nightcap/sipper, and overflowing with character and charisma. Love it, can't say enough good things. 1,057 charactersplfahey, Jul 08, 2011

Poured into a chalice, a deep, dark brown with a delicate whitish head that dissipates a bit, but not quite completely, and not before leaving some bubbly lace on the glass. Dark sugars and dark, dried fruits in the nose, sweet and malty, with hints of vanilla, and some noticeable alcohol. Rich tastes of caramel and toffee, raisins, figs, pears, brown sugar, and a touch of tobacco; warming alcohol bite. Smooth and full of flavor, finishes dry and slightly bitter.

4.92/5  rDev +10.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Appearance - Pour came out over carbonated, but it settled into a small head that has good lacing. Very opaque brown with strong ruby notes. 
Smell - this is what beer should smell like. Sweetened figs and sugar hit the nose straight away. Alcohol comes in but doesn't overpower. 
Taste - dark sweet fruits are in your face. Once they subside, the malt bill laced with alcohol finishes the taste with flare. One flavor doesn't overpower the other, but each comes in stages. 
Mouthfeel - light body for the ABV. The aftertaste consists of a chewy malty bill with sugary goodness. Then you breathe out; and the alcohol makes it presence known. 
Final thoughts - wow. This is a complex beer that goes down so well. I would compare it to a fine wine. With it's fruity notes and deep, rich flavors, the comparison is obvious. Nearly perfect. Its knock is the alcohol presence. Just a tad too much for me. Other than that, Perfect in my opinion. 943 charactersVncentLIFE, Jul 04, 2011

The only additions are that identical two pours (me and a mate) varied in head size, between 1 to 2+ fingers. Head did not retain as long as I thought it would.
Apart from that - Christmas Cake in a glass. Wonderful full creamy mouthfeel. Complex, and no real bitterness. The ABV, whilst warming, scarily does not intrude. Went great with dessert.

Bottled on 090615
Aroma: Caramel, brandy, and dried plum. Definitely takes will-power to not take a quick sip.
Appearance: Hazy, opaque dark brown body. Light tan 2-fingered head drops to one, then slowly dissipates. Light lacing clings around the inside of the glass.
Flavor: Big, carmelly, candied/dried fruit at first. Almost-cloying sweetness through the middle, partly derived from noticeable alcohol presence. Slightly-bitter noble hop profile accompanies balanced bitterness at the end. 
Mouthfeel: Medium-full body, and medium carbonation. Peppery warmth from alcohol lingers on tongue and in the throat.
Overall: Excellent, flavorful, complex, malty quad. A bit too sweet to drink multiples of, but a delicious beer that would be highly suitable with a sweet, carmelly dessert. 837 charactersmdvatab, Jul 03, 2011

It made a nice thick golden head when poured into a wide, stem-less wine glass. It has so much fragrance, very malty and rich. The consistency was fairly thick, and a small sip fills your mouth with so much flavor. A really great example of Belgian brown ale and a must try. 408 characterswo87810, Jul 01, 2011
4.13/5  rDev -7.6%look: 3.5 | smell: 3 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4My first review!
Serving Type: 330 ml bottle poured into a glass goblet.
Appearance: Pours a cloudy dark brown with a thin off-white head which dissipates quickly, due to the high alcohol content, to a ring around the edges.
Smell: Subtle aroma for such a big beer, light alcohol, dark malts, dried fruit (raisins and figs).
Taste: Tastes much more complex than the aroma would anticipate. No strong alcohol like I was expecting, deep malty goodness, bready (esp. bread crust), slight sweetness, light hop flavor (floral dominates), yeasty esters of dried fruits and sweetness, nice malty aftertaste.
Mouthfeel: Light for such a tasty brew, slightly prickly carbonation.
Overall: Quite a delicious beer, tastes much better than it smells, this is a dangerous beer I could definitely have a few to many of these. 817 charactersmetal850, Jul 01, 2011
4.97/5  rDev +11.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured into a Chimay goblet from an 11.2 oz bottle.
A - Dark Brown, almost black, with a good 1 finger head that dissipated into a solid off white ring around the top. Lacing is minimal. 
S - Smells of cherries, ripe plums, and apricots. Yeast notes are also detected. 
T - Taste of yeast, plums, apricots and alcohol. Very pleasant and lingering.
M - Good carbonation with a heavy finish. It's a beer that let's you know, you are drinking a real beer.
Overall this is one of the best beers I have tried and definitely the best Quad I have had. I will be having this beer in the future. If only the price wasn't $6.49 a bottle at my beverage store, I would have this a few times a week. 691 charactersbluesfan1181, Jun 30, 2011

S - Smells like what it is a Belgian. Lots of yeasty smell to it as well as a sweet, sweet smell.
T/M - God damn! Yeast, sweetness, malt. In that order. A very nice beer. You sure this is 11.3%? Not a flat beer at all, a very mild to moderate carbonation that is very very nice!
O - Well hidden 11.3% ABV as mentioned above. This is a damn good beer, Definitely a top 2 or top 3 Trappist (I know thats not saying much when theres like only 7 Trappist breweries, but to me its huge!)
PP (Price Point) - $6.99 for a 12oz bottle, at a very low priced craft store. Hard to bite off and chew, but I can justify it by saying its $3.50 for a 12oz 5.6% beer, which we pay all the time for crap beer. DO IT, at least once, def seek it out and try! 835 charactersalexhahn82, Jun 30, 2011
4/5  rDev -10.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Tonight we are drinking from our new glasses. Since we started this project, we have just been pouring this into whatever glass we can find in the kitchen cabinet. But this weekend we were shopping at Hamilton Town Center, an outdoor mall just north of where we live, and decided to invest in some new glasses. What we got are not glasses… but candle holders. But trust me, they look like perfect drinking glasses. Especially since we share a single bottle per post.
The beer we are drinking tonight is the 10 in a series of 3 beers from Rochefort. I feel like I have had this beer before, but don’t recall. On BeerAdvocate, it has a rating of A with nearly every person that reviews it giving it an A+ rating. So it must be good! And for those of you wondering, it does not mean 10 years, rather the gravity that the beer was produced at. (Yeah, I don’t really understand it either.)
The beer smells incredible. Ignore the fact that you can smell the HUGE ABV that this beer offers, coming in over 11%. Let’s just focus on the earthy wood smells that just scream from the bottom of the glass. The more you smell this, the more I just want to sniff it…
When you finally decide to take a drink, you are SMACKED In the face with instant carbonation and a smooth mouthfeel from front to back. Then the flavors circle the palate, coming to rest on a smooth, smoky, and somewhat weak, but pleasing aftertaste. I will tell you, if you smell this beer before drinking… right before drinking, the beer has a much more enhanced flavor.
The beer is good… and it doesn’t taste like it smells. There is hardly any, if any at all, alcohol flavor on the palate. But that’s okay. Of course, that is also dangerous since you could pound these beers if you wanted. But again, coming in at 11.3% ABV you should only drink one or two of these before slowing down. I fear starting at the 10 I wouldn’t enjoy the 8 or the 6 as much… but you know what I always say… 1,971 charactersrickyleepotts, Jun 29, 2011
4.63/5  rDev +3.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Had this amazing beer before but never got to review it, so here it goes.
Pours an opaque dark brown / reddish color, very murky, with almost no light going through. It forms an amazing 2 finger tan head that lasts for a good 3-5 minutes, only to recede to a thin layer of foam that sits covering the entire surface of the liquid, not just the sides. Lacing is fairly low probably due to the high abv.
Aroma is yeasty/spicy. Right of the bat I get a lot of fruity, clove and pepper spiciness. Lots of plums, red grapes and green raisins. It kind of reminds me of red wine a lot. This is all followed by a malty sweet back bone with faint chocolate notes.
Taste is remarkable. It starts out as a sweet explosion with plums, raisins and dark fruits appearing right away. They are followed by a caramel and mollasses sweetness ending with a very distinctive spicy yeast taste that I get from most good belgian strong ales. Aftertaste is lasting and strong, with different notes appearing in your mouth after you swallow it, mainly a fruity tartness and some tobacco.
Body is heavy but not overpowering in any means. The sweetness is there but it never gets old, paired perfectly with the yeast compounds. I do not even miss my beloved hops. Carbonation is moderate to high and alcohol warmth is present but very well hidden.
Overall this is a world class beer from the best, readily available and decently priced brewery from Belgium. Rochefort just can't do no wrong. Grab this beer if you can and sip it by the fire, just like i'm doing right now. It sure beats the shit out of any wine. 1,591 characterspaulozanello, Jun 29, 2011
4.74/5  rDev +6%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5330ml bottle poured into a snifter
some numbers on the bottle: 260515 and 08:27, decrypted to possibly mean best before May 2015, maybe? not sure what the second set of numbers is
A: Pours a nice dark brown, with a lighter caramel color along the edges, mostly opaque except for the upper outer edges of the glass. I poured this pretty aggressively but it still gave an almost negligible about of head, and what was present dissipated almost immediately. Left no appreciable lacing. 
S: The smell is incredibly sweet with lots of red grapes, raisins, and plum. The alcohol is certainly noticeable. The initial smell is almost reminiscent of a dry red wine. A good swirl of the snifter brings out some sweet caramel malts, hints of brown sugar and an oh so subtle roasted aroma.
T: The first sip is sweet roasted malts with a caramel flavor. Lots of plum early on, then flavors of molasses, red grape, hints of dark chocolate and even some occasional very subtle hop bitterness. This beer has such a heavy sweetness, which somehow manages to never overpower, as it is perfectly balanced with great roasted malt flavors, as well as a subtle spicy character. The alcohol is certainly present, but never in a distracting or overpowering way. Such an incredible balance of sweetness, roasted malts, and alcohol. Complex and delicious.
M/D: Full bodied, with a sweet, syrupy mouthfeel that leaves you licking your lips. It warms the body to the point that I can feel the blood rushing to my face. Not sure if that’s the alcohol content, or me falling in love. Very smooth, easy to drink, and does a nice job of masking the ABV. 
O: I have been trying to get a hold of this beer for quite some time, as it always seems to be sold out at the places around me that carry it. I now see why. Fantastic brew, and well worth the wait. Far and away the best quad I have had, and certainly one of the best beers I have ever had the pleasure to drink. World class. 1,955 characterszac16125, Jun 27, 2011

Poured into a wine goblet. First time drinking a Quad, so we'll see how this goes. Could be a little rough around the edges. Drank the 8 previously so we'll see how the 10 goes.
Pours a dark caramel brown with a thin white head that fairly quickly dissipates. Can see some active carbonation in the glass. Fair amount of sediment at the end of the bottle.
Smell is of figs, dates, raisons, caramel, molasses, and a boozy sweetness.
Taste presents a cornucopia of different flavors. Very boozy with strains of caramel, dates, raisons, figs, just as the nose suggested. Caramelized sugars are at work here. Some nice dark fruit undertones of candied pear or plum. A little spiciness on the finish akin to some black pepper. Overall, also has a moist earthy quality to it with some hints of oak. Very complex and delicious.
Mouthfeel is just fine. Mild carbonation and a sticky, syrupy sweet quality that coats the mouth.
Overall, a very complex, rich, nourishing beer that is entertaining and rewarding to drink and contemplate. 1,132 charactersJohnnyP3, Jun 25, 2011

A: Dark brown, cloudy, with a small head that disappeared quickly.
S: Rich, sweet, and pungent - molasses, bananas, some light mango or rasins.
T: Complex and sweet, the molasses really comes through, with some punch at the back side of spices coming out over the fruit. Leaves my mouth warm and pleasant feeling for quite a while afterwards.
M: Light carbonation, not too heavy given the complexity of the flavors going on here.
Overall, a fantastically complex beer that somehow doesn't come off too heavy, despite the alcohol. 575 charactersahogue, Jun 25, 2011

Fruity and Chocolaty on the first taste a good hint of alcohol in it as well. On second taste I really get a lot of dark chocolate. The malt comes through and has a very subtle smoke to it. 
A bit pungent on the pallet but quite and extraordinary beer. 401 charactersbamojr, Jun 24, 2011
4.88/5  rDev +9.2%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5At $7.50 per bottle, I figured this just has to be a great beer. Every expectation: met and exceeded.
It looks glorious, to put it mildly. One of the darkest, and the most textured looking Belgian I've tried, with a lofty head that slides down revealing the very definition of nice lacing on the glass.
Smells of the usual suspects: figs and wheat, but there's a certain sharpness that cuts through. Unlike the bite of an IPA, this sharpness seems to portend a visceral experience on the tongue.
Taste is slightly warm, a subtle arrangement of bold spices and raisins or apples, with a vigorous carbonation spiking everything up a notch. It's the careful balance of these aspects that makes this one such a fantastic experience.
Mouthfeel comes in thick, but nowhere near overly so, even for the style. It's situated at this perfect crossroads of viscosity and carbonation. Being a huge fan of RIS's and other oily monsters, this is a surprising and huge plus point.
There's some alcohol warmth building up by the end which is to be expected at 11.3%, but I can confidently state that this one appears no stronger than 8% or so, and even then, well masked. Its smoothness and hidden strength let me imagine this as the ninja assassin of quads, of Belgians, of beer in general. 1,281 charactersoptimistictour, Jun 23, 2011

S: Amazing ! Lots of dark fruits, along withe caramel and chocolate malts. Extremely powerful.
T: The taste follows the nose with plenty of dark fruits: plum, grapes and so on. Alcohol is present also and its warmth compensates for the sweetness of the malt. A very complex and well balanced beer.
M: Smoothy and sweet but not liquorous. Carbonation is just perfect.
O: Well, could I say that it's the best beer in the world ? At least one of the greatest I've ever tried. Such a good beer that I have never been able to make a single bottle last enough to age... 670 charactersFux, Jun 20, 2011

Certainly one of my favorite styles, the Belgian Quad is a thing of beauty such as tight capri pants on an overweight, balding, Italian man in the dead of summer along the northern Sicilian coast (or perhaps the complete opposite depending on my mood). 
Between this beer and Bernardus 12, is there a better example of a world-class beer that can be picked up off the shelf at many beer stores throughout the US?
Pours a dark brown that is a few shades less than black with some ruby and chestnut hues capped with a slightly frothy light tan head. Head sticks around for a bit, but dissipates like a flock of tweens at Chipolte when they moms arrive to corral the youngsters into a motorcade of luxury SUVs.
Smells just like a Quad should with a plethora of dark fruits surrounded by a slightly spicy Belgian yeast like deutschbag male lifeguard (are there any other types of male lifeguards out there? Would certainly be news to me) being bombarded by middle-aged divorcees who have all seen better days. Some nice malt rounds out this gem.
Taste is wonderful with dark fruits, malt and yeast working in perfect harmony like frosted hair and designer handbags. This is seemingly at the dryer end the style spectrum with just a hint of sweetness. Fuller-bodied , but Atkins is not needed just yet.
Very nice that this beer is increasing its availability while decreasing its price. 1,518 charactersLunch, Jun 18, 2011

Smells like dried fruit, caramel, and a hint of alcohol.
Tastes like raisins, prunes, oak, caramel, and quite a bit of alcohol.
Plenty of heat from the alcohol, a bit of carbonation, and some creaminess. Medium body. 
A truly great beer. The alcohol is prevalent, but it's never unwelcome. The sweetness borders on cloying, but never gets too overwhelming. Amazing balance throughout. 439 charactersAiryk12, Jun 17, 2011

Aroma of huge brown sugar, into caramel, then dark malts. Just. Amazing. Reminds me of DFH Raison D'Etre in terms of fig and raisin, but way more intense.
Taste of caramel, sweet raisins and dark malts, brown sugar and very ripe figs. Perfect score.
Mouthfeel is quite sweet with brown sugar and Belgian yeasts. Allowing the beer to warm up brings out the flavors twice as much. Be sure to drink those delicious yeasts at the end of the bottle. World class brew. 651 charactersToAzwethinkweizm, Jun 14, 2011

S – Sweet dark fruits – cherry, fig and a nice brown sugar and malt sweetness. The 11% abv makes itself known, but in a complimentary rather than dominant fashion. Some v. light smokiness in this complex brew.
T – Simply sublime! This is truly one of the great beers – complex malt, sweetness & dark fruits (figs, raisins & cherries) with a mild alcohol bite with a nice yeast flavor in the background. I can taste some mild spiciness, but that is definitely in the background and adds to the complexities of this amazing beer. Has a wonderful sweet, slightly dry finish that just lingers on the back of the mouth.
M – Creamy and surprisingly effervescent yet thick and thin at the same time. 
O – Belgian quad perfection! Definitely lives up to its high ranking. Perhaps the most accessible of the “great” beers in the world – a true gem! 1,023 charactersml67, Jun 13, 2011

A nicely carbonated hiss is followed by a stunning looking Quad. Black, with mahagony around the edges, a beautiful, thick creamy tan head that would hold its own against many a stout. 
 Aromatically intense, very complex.The sweet-malty profile of most Quads plays a background role. Here a suprising nose full of fruit.Apple, pear,fig,plums,raisins,tobacco, smoky spiciness like a Bordeaux, Cherry,blueberries, blackberries, spices-pepper, clove musty bready graininess, star anise, black grapes.What a complex Quad, I can't imagine it being much better.
I'm greeted by a sip of the best quad I've ever had. Light,spicy, prickling, yet perfectly creamy and rich. Pepper, clove, anise, raisin,pear, black grapes, fig, raisin, malt, tobacco,cocoa, Bordeaux wine again. Sour molasses and cherries mingle with cocoa and vanilla, all finish with a kick of pepper, completed by a palate-tingling burn of alcohol. Not buried, but integrated and well-used.
The mouthfeel of this is damn near perfection. LIvely,rich, sweet, spicy and warm all in one. This brew exibits the best of what beer complexity can be, and would easily hold it's own in a beer vs wine pairing against any Pinto Noir or Bordeaux. 1,341 charactersczfreeman, Jun 11, 2011

Poured into my dfh snifter, pours a murky brown color, poured slowly so little head, but the craziest thing Ive ever seen at the top of the beer with the head: the carbonation bubbles are swirling around in circles in the middle of the glass. Nuts! Smell- sweet fruits, cherry, breadyness, brown sugar, alcohol, maybe a faint scent of chocolate. WOW there is a lot going on here. Could probably think about it and smell it over and over and get something different. Taste- prunes, richest carbonation I have ever experienced in a beer, cherries, raisins, almost no alcohol present. Amazing for 11.3% beer. Mouthfeel- the rich carbonation off sets the richness of this beer and gives it a needed dry quality. I've never had a beer this big that was this smooth. I can't even imagine what this will do with time. Drinkability- this is among one of the best beers I have ever had.

The pours have consistently been of a dark brown color and the head on top is minimal and a beige/tan color. It does have a murky look to is, as the previous reviewer stated.
The smell is divine, as there are distinct fruity notes as it hits the nose. It does not overwhelm or reek of booze.
As the 10 hits your tongue, it is smooth and flavorful. The taste of cherries, figs, and other fruits are there, but are well-blended.
It is not heavy and the flavor doesn't linger or becoming annoying to drink. They beer is very well done and I will promise never to pronounce it like the "stinky cheese." 724 charactersDuffman929, Jun 06, 2011

A- Dark reddish brown in color that is very apparently murky and from the looks of it there is some sediment floating around. A small tan head forms composed of medium sized bubbles but disappears almost completely with only the slightest of patches sticking around with no lace.
S- Dark fruits jump forwards with plums and figs making their presence first as it develops into a dark cherry smell that is slightly tart. Small traces of apple linger as the middle develops into a chocolate dominance that helps to compliment the dark fruit beginning. The end brings a finish of noticeable alcohol, although I wouldn't go as far as to stay that it is harsh or reflecting the 11.3% that is shown on the bottle.
T- A smooth malt beginning is noticeable for moments before the taste begins to accentuate the plum and fig flavor that was noticeable in the nose. There is a slight tart apple that makes a quick appearance towards the middle but disappears as fast as it came. Low levels of coco come in the middle but the dark fruits still dominate the taste profile. The end finishes with a rising alcohol taste and warmth that lingers into the finish.
M- Thick in the body, slightly chewy as well. Moderate low carbonation as well with a warming alcohol presence in the mouth.
O- Complex and delicious beer to say the least. I wish I would have put two of these away at the same time in order to see if the alcohol presence would have mellowed just a little bit more in another year as well as the development of the other components. Not that I need to tell anyone, but a great example of the style. 1,682 charactersLolli1315, Jun 06, 2011

A - very dark brown, hint of dark red light through the edges, murky. Great big taupe head with medium dissipation.
S - heat, dark fruity smells, vanilla, chocolate. Very subtle, nice complexity.
T - touch of heat, cherries, cholatey malts, dry on the finish. Again, nice subtle complexities. A bit hot.
M - Very smooth, a bit dry, moderately robust.
O (D) - A great beer, but surprisingly hot. Will have to get more and lay it down a bit longer. Cheers. 471 charactersColdPoncho, Jun 06, 2011
4.5/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A: Pours a dark brown color with some light reddish hues. Provides a thick tan foam head that has moderate retention. There is a lot of lacing down the sides of the glass.
S: Lots of sweet dark fruits. Plums, raisins and prunes are the most prevalent. There is also a nice amount of caramel and brown sugar. Very potent smell. 
T: The beer starts off with a lot of dark fruits. The plums and raisins are very prominant at the beginning. Very sweet and tasty. In the middle the sweet brown sugar comes into play and blends well with the dark fruit. On the back end, more of the same, but a little bit of alcohol flavor comes into play. 
M: This beer is quite thick, full bodied. Leaves a slick sweet taste of dark dry fruit on the palate. 
O: This is a fantastic Quad. For a beer with 11% alcohol, it is pretty well hidden and only comes through on the back end. It is not overly hot though. This is a must try beer indeed! 926 charactersIronCitySteve, Jun 06, 2011
4.03/5  rDev -9.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Appearance - Rochefort 10 is very dark and hard to see through at all. Pours with very little head (probably one half a finger). Some yeast specks floating around at the bottom of the glass that I poured it into.
Smell - The smell of the beer is quite sweet and full bodied. I smelled raisins, dates, slight coffee smell and plums. Slightly malty aroma. 
Taste - The beer initially hits the palate with a faint, mellow sweetness that transitions into almost a coffee/caramel taste near the end of the sip. Cannot really taste the alcohol content in the beer, which to me is a good thing.
Mouthfeel - Pretty heavily bodied. The beer was very smooth though and pleasing.
Overall - This beer was quite good. It was not as good as a Rochefort 8 that I had, but it was still exquisite. I prefer the sweetness of the Rochefort 8 over this beer's slight coffee taste (as it transitions to the back of the mouth). Overall a good beer that I would try again (if there weren't any Rochefort 8's available). 1,000 charactersajcobb24, Jun 05, 2011
4.47/5  rDev 0%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured into a tulip glass.
Appearance: Dark cola brown color with a small head. Really sticky lacing all over the side of the glass.
Smell: As soon as you pop the bottle, the room just starts to smell like an amazing beer. Dark fruit, sweet malts, and brown sugar.
Taste: This beer is delicious! Very sweet malts, raisins and plums, candied sugar and burnt caramel. Fantastic beer! So balanced and not overly sweet even though there is not much bitterness for balance. As the beer warms, the booze shows itself a bit. Its just the right amount to burn, not much... but it reminds you of the high ABV of the beer. 
Mouthfeel: Full bodied with moderate carbonation. The mouthfeel really makes this beer shine and its done well.
Overall: i knew this was a really good Quad according to the beer lists on this site. Only had a few beers this style and was really not to interested in drinking Quads. Now that i have had this beer, I will be on the lookout for Quads of this caliber. Fantastic! 994 characters4DAloveofSTOUT, Jun 05, 2011
4.32/5  rDev -3.4%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.533cl Bottle, been with me for a while, best before 15th Nov 2011. Poured into a Westmalle chalice on 4th June 2011.
Lovely dark ruby red body, a very thin cream coloured head sat on top, it became a wispy half covering fairly quickly becoming almost just a collar in places.
The smell is malty, as is the main flavour in the first sip. As the beer warmed a chocolate touch came into the taste, sharp and dark, some coffee notes as well. The alcohol sits just below the surface and pops up towards the end of the mouthfeel, just to remind you it carries a punch if you try and drink it too fast or without due reverence.
I can see why this beer is scored so highly, very impressive on all accounts. 700 charactersBlackHaddock, Jun 04, 2011
4/5  rDev -10.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Pours a deep dark mahogany color, quite opaque but dark amber at the bottom edge. Fizzy short-lived head, no suprise there at 11.3% Smell is brown sugar maltiness, plums and dates, a warming rich smell. Taste is woody, slighty sweet, sherry-like, not too boozy, dark fruits with a warming afterglow. Has a bit of an oily, spicy aftertaste that isn't that great. Feel is fairly full bodied, a little bite on the palette.
Not a bad quad at all, not the best I ever had, but still...quite good. 492 charactersSamN, Jun 04, 2011
4.35/5  rDev -2.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Deep, dark brown and almost black hue with a creamy off-white head on top and decent retention. Leaves some lacing. Never really seen a beer quite this color. The aroma is superb and welcoming with sweet caramel and sweet booze notes. 
The taste is superb and full of dark-roasted caramel malts that make the beer sweet and flavorful. Chocolate notes are there too, but I mostly notice caramel more than in any other beer I've had. It's sweet and almost dessert-like. The booziness is noticeable in a big, enveloping way immediately after the sweetness of the caramel. As it warms up, the alcohol becomes more and more pronounced, almost to the point of taking away from the amazing sweetness and flavor of the caramel, and this is the only reason I take off any points for this one. With such a high ABV this is somewhat expected however, and the overall flavor was still fantastic. Also the alcohol was warming, so it wasn't much of a detriment to the flavor. The mouthfeel is just spot on with a creamy smoothness that brings the whole beer together into a nice package. It's clean in the finish, with lingering boozy twinges in the mouth. Overall, fantastic beer and one I'm glad I had the chance to taste. 1,211 charactersRschis16, Jun 03, 2011
4.55/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5A- Poured into a Rochefort chalice, a dark cola brown, opaque with reddish, caramel hues at the edges when held to light. A gentle pour to avoid sediment produces only the most wispy, faint suggestion of a beige head. 
S- Sweet, fruity alcohol, dark fruits, sugary molasses, just a hint of spice.
T- Lots of delicious dark fruits (plums, figs, dates, raisins). Thick, bready malts and brown sugar. Alcohol is warming and immensely complex, combined with the fruit and some considerable spiciness it has a bit of a tropical, rum effect. I gave this section a 5 for a reason, there is no room for improvement here.
M- Medium to full bodied, healthy amounts of carbonation create a smooth feel.
O- One of the best beers ever made, its complexity is staggering and its flavors work perfectly together, a real pleasure to drink. 827 charactersWillCarrera, Jun 02, 2011

A- A deep dark kinda murkey brown. A light tan head that somewhat sticks around.
S- Hints of raisin and plum with some alcohol. Also Cocoa and dark sugars.
T- Peppery at first and moves on to rich breadiness. Also hints of molassis. Big maltiness/sweet/fruity. Definetely contains alcohol.
M- Full Bodied (perfect). Creamy and a warm alcoholness.
O- A wonderful Quad (one of the best) and a must have for the style. 494 charactersckcanady, Jun 02, 2011
4.25/5  rDev -4.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4My last rochefort of the 3 main ones distributed. I looked my reviews and I'm surprised to see I didn't review the 6 or the 8 but next time I buy them I will.
Pours dark brown. The brown color looks like the color of milk chocolate. I don't really get as much sediment as I did with 6 and 8. #10 seems more fruit forward with aromas of sweet plums jumping at your tastebuds as you take a sip. The 11.3% ABV is pretty well hidden as the fruit aromas cover it up and leave none to very little alcohol burn and stepping aside for the smoothness of the sip. This is goes down easy. This is brewery is one of the reasons why I want to visit Belgium. Hopefully I get to do that one day soon. 686 charactersBigB415, May 31, 2011

S: Smells of sweet dark fruits, molasses, there are hints of some spices. There is also a bit of a booze scent (as expected with 11.3%).
T: There is a sweetness to the taste with hints of dark fruitiness (dark fruits, figs, cherries). Very malty beer with little hop presence that finishes with the spices and molasses notes. This is a very delicious beer.
M: Medium to full bodied with average carbonation. The feel is malty and a bit sweet.
D: This is without question, a world class beer. The flavor is very complex and excellent, it is very smooth and creamy and it is a well balanced beer. I've enjoyed all 3 Rocheforts thoroughly, but this is the best. 800 charactersmavbrew, May 31, 2011

The smell is sweet mature fruits - dates, figs, some dark bread crust, vinous notes, Madeira-
The taste is very sweet, caramelized sugar, dried fruits, plums, rather vinous, sherry, Madeira, malty tones, dark bread crust, then some bitter notes, cherry seeds, bitter almond.
The carbonation is medium, small bubbles, the body is hugh, a soft and oily texture, a warm dry finish.
A very good trappist, but maybe the 8 version is a bit more balanced, the alcohol and sweetness is dominating here. 596 charactersrarbring, May 25, 2011
1.06/5  rDev -76.3%look: 2 | smell: 1 | taste: 1 | feel: 1 |  overall: 1Pours a murky dark brown with a 2 inch beige head that fades to a film on the top of the beer. No lacing forms on the drink down. Smells of dark fruits, fermented raisins, spices, and yeast. There is a bit of a funky smell coming out of the glass too. Taste is very spicy and surprisingly funky. Lots of fermented dark fruits and super dark brown sugar. However, there is a definitely an off flavor here as I am tasting dirty gym socks. It's to degree where it's not very dominant but it's enough to be noticeable. The beer is pretty flat and combined with the taste it's a chore to even sip on this one. Overall, I need to get another bottle of this to rereview sometime because I think there is something wrong with this one. 727 charactersUCLABrewN84, May 24, 2011

The aroma of this beer is amazing. As soon as I started pouring the beer the scent was escaping out of the glass like crazy. I'm getting a lot of dark fruit but rum soaked raisins are the most prevalent of all. Toffee, yeast, belgian spices, cloves apples and pears make up the rest of the nose
Dark fruity maltiness, clove, yeast, cinnamon-raisin bread, belgian yeast and booze all blend together perfectly in this beer. One of the best tasting dark belgians I've had 
Mouthfeel is very silky and well carbonated. The carbonation stings the tongue with each sip but every sip just gets smoother and smoother. Very nice touch of warming alcohol as well
Overall, this beer is a must try. It was everything I was hoping I would get out of it and maybe a little bit more. The darkest quad I'ver ever had for sure, and one of the best. 927 charactersdcloeren, May 23, 2011

Smells of dark fruit, figs, some floral notes. Surprisingly pleasing aroma.
Tastes of dark fruit, figs, some sugar sweetness but this one is really dry in the best way. Lingering notes of honey, the smallest amount of bitterness.
The mouthfeel is perfect. High carbonation and dry as a bone make this one insanely drinkable.
This review is based off a 2007 bottle. And, all I can say is "wow." This is how quads should taste. This is how fine beer should taste. 519 charactersTenHornsProud, May 21, 2011

Ah, she pours a dark muddy, ugly, sewer water looking dark brown. Lots of hints of orange yellow and red flow in it, with a tight bubbely 1 finger head that sticks around for quite a bit. Very dungeony looking beer. The smell, well, where to begin? This shit is something else thats for true. High octane raisins and figs hit the nose accompanied by huge alcohol clouds and ends with subtle grape juice like finish. Dark chocolates, strawberries, cherries, vanilla, cherry oak, rich malts, and of course that famous Belgian yeast strands are also very detectable. Dark fruits, sweet brown sugars, dark chocolates, smoked apples and cherries. Sweet grapes and mellow fruits add to the finish. Medium to heavy on the feel, almost like syrup, so so sweet yet a mild finish. This kind of melts in your mouth like cotton candy, it feels very heavy then melts away, amazing. What more is there to say? This is great. 963 charactersgabedivision, May 21, 2011

Purchased @ The Good Beer Store, Fryeburg Maine
Price - $7.49/bottle(11.2oz)
Cloudy brown in color with a 1 inch foam head that disappears to a ring around the glass. Spotty lacing that's short lived. 
Heavy scent of raisins, candy sugar, plums and caramel. Kind of port like and very pleasent. 
The taste follows the nose with dark fruit, candy sugar, caramel and a spicey undertone followed by a rum finish. The flavor is delicious and addicting. I can't keep my lips off the glass. 
Mouthfeel is amazingly smooth like velvet followed by an edge of dryness. Medium body. 
Alcohol is mellow and well hidden.
A magnificent example of the style and a favorite of mine in the Quad group. I've had many of these over the course of time but never reviewed it, shame on me. 798 characters05Harley, May 20, 2011
3.9/5  rDev -12.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Enjoyed from my Russian River Belgian glass.
A - Pours a murky brown with two fingers of light tan head that retains fairly well as the beer sits. Nice lacing on the glass as well.
S - At first the scent is very sweet, perhaps a molasses of sorts or maybe some dark fruits. Light hints of a more floral scent as well. Also picking up heavy bite from the booze in the scent. This one should probably sit for a couple years.
T - The taste is very alcoholic up front, with the sweeter tastes following from the nose coming as more of a background influence than really dominating the flavor. Finishes with a very strong bite. This needs to sit for a couple years.
M - Stings the mouth a bit with a sharp alcohol bite. Also fairly carbonated, so perhaps that adds to it. Again, may be better with some age.
O - Overall a decent beer, but I am definitely looking forward to revisiting my review with an aged bottle to compare the two! 934 charactersMarkIntihar, May 17, 2011

Murky dark brown body- with a huge off-white head- good retention and decent lace. Lots of swamp water looking sediment. This quad smells of Belgian yeast, sweet candy sugar, and a slight fruitiness. A few sips and I know this is a well made ale. Dark fruit notes dominate with touches of apple and candy sugar. There is faint booze but not in a bad way. Medium body and a nice spritzy medium carbonation. Very good beer and my first from Rochefort. 547 charactersgnemesis, May 16, 2011

A - Very nice clear red/brown/copper color. Soapy head that dissipates rapidly. Little head retention is expected @ 11.3%... Head builds quickly... No lacing, but nice legs.
S - Slight cherry scent along with molasses, vanilla, and slight vinegar. Doesn't smell overly sweet or sugary. 
T - Very smooth and nice. Slight heat, but not as much as expected @ 11.3%. Very balanced. Amazingly smooth. Lacks your typical Quad burn.
M - Perfect carbonation. Light bodied and quite airy.

T: Follows the nose. Dark fruits hit first... raisin, prune, dark cherry. Next hints of molasses, brown sugar chocolate. And finally, just a hint of hops to clean it all up. Complex and tasty!

4.31/5  rDev -3.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Poured into my trusty Duvel tulip.
A - An almost black brown color with a sturdy tan 2 finger head that gradually settled into a nice film throughout this drink.
S - A sugary molasses smell with a touch of raisins and cocoa. Not overpowering, more of a subtle aroma on this brew.
T - A bit of alcohol heat on the first sip but nothing that would indicate its 11%. Very smooth. My first thoughts were cocoa and dried fruits, with some malty sweetness. Very nice!
M- I can't believe this is an 11% beer. The mouthfeel is medium at most and very drinkable. You could drink a number of these based on the mouthfeel but obviously not on the alcohol content.
O - Excellent! This is a complex, high quality quad with a myriad of flavors and one that won't overpower the palate with heavy stickiness. Very impressed. 813 charactersturfy, May 12, 2011
4.83/5  rDev +8.1%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 533 cl bottle poured into a Rochefort chalice
A-Deep, dark brown with a creamy tan head that starts at three fingers and quickly fades to a one finger head. Sticky lacing all the way down the glass.
S-Incredibly complex, each time I go back in, I get more aromas. Dark and candy sugars lead into dark fruits, raisins and plums amongst others. Slight black licorice notes with hints of cocoa powder hiding in the background.
T-Follows the nose with the dark fruits and sugary, caramel malts, but rum notes also are added. The anise or licorice is still there with molasses as well. Hints of more tropical fruits play with some tobacco flavors, but in a good way. There is a lot going on here!
M-Creamy, velvety, full bodied. This is a pleasure to drink.
O-Definitely my favorite quad/BSDA if not my favorite beer. If I had only this to drink for the rest of my life, I would be a happy man. Although I think I would stick to 1 a night. 938 charactershannydawg, May 11, 2011
4.35/5  rDev -2.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Single bottle (date stamp is 280415 - whatever that means) poured into a Rochefort chalice
Appearance: Slow pour to keep the sediment in (which didn't quite work) yielded a dark brown mostly translucent beer. Thin persistent off white skin of foam across the top with gaps (didn't go all the way across) and thin ring at the edge as well. Can just make out small bubbles coming up slowly through the glass at the edges. Sadly no lacing to speak of. 
Smell: Rich malty sweetness with a solid hint of phenol, but it's muted and blended with all the malt so not overpowering. I've smelled phenol in the lab before (I'm a chemist) and it is NOT a pleasant smell - it's medicinal and powerful moldy at the same time. This is different - I can smell that phenol, but it's blended with a nice sweet smell and maybe some sort of candied fruit. Interesting and appealing. 
Taste: Rich and sweet maltness here - syrupy in a good way. A little bit buttery toffee thrown in as well. Alcohol is very well hidden - I'm not detecting it at all. Very tasty beer. 
Mouthfeel: Quick prickly carbonation on the tongue, then gone, leaving a chewy and smooth beer. 
Overall / Drinkability: I think I've said it before and I'll say it again, I think the famous Rochefort chalice is the wrong glass for this beer. I think I would capture more of the smells and tastes if this was in a tulip and next time that's what I'll use. Overall a very malt forward beer, but not cloying, and a very interesting to sip and savor. Despite the higher alcohol I did not notice it until the end of the glass, but by then the alcohol was warming and even then I was pleasantly sated - no need for a second glass. Really a great beer and worth getting again, but for special occasions. This is not a beer for every night. 1,786 charactersdamndirtyape, May 11, 2011

Pours a deep, dark brown, close to black and nearly opaque. Fizzy light brown head that dissipates after a short time. Lacing is there, but not incredibly sticky.
Dark fruits, brown sugar, hints of herbal qualities.
Big, plum-fig malty character with some elements of spice. Alcohol content is evident, but I wouldn't call this one boozy. Warming, though. Elements of spicy Belgian yeast. Caramelized or brown sugar notes throughout. A flash every now and then of anise.
Medium to full-bodied with a soft mouthfeel.
This is the fullest-bodied, darkest and richest of the Rochefort family. Another solid offering from a solid lineup. 703 charactersghetto90007, May 10, 2011

An extremely rich, but at the same time sharp, quickly-curtailed injection of rich plum/fig/raisin/prune dark fruits. Some aggressively sugary Chimay-like Belgian esters follow, and perhaps a hint of hops. Might go really well with some brie. I think among aggressively fruity dark ales, I may almost prefer Bell's Batch 9000. 375 charactersgoethean, May 10, 2011

I discovered a wonderful murky brown beer hidden under the plain label as I poured this legend into my customary snifter. My nose was welcomed by a chocolate raisin aroma that reminded me of oak and dark fruits.
The lace played on the sides of the glass as I sipped the chocolate and malty mystery. The taste was beyond words as hints of dark fruit, cherries, rum and chocolate played on my tongue while the I was warmed by the 11.3 % alcohol.
This was a world class beer that just took the words right out of my mouth, I will seek its splendor the rest of my days. 654 charactersLeeryLeprechaun, May 07, 2011

Pours a nice murky chestnut brown that just looks Belgian to me ha. Head is just chillin there, not going away - very nice. Aroma is dark fruit and warming alcohol.

4.6/5  rDev +2.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5A- Deep, deep garnet, with a one and a half finger head, manila folder colored. Copious amounts of lacing,
S- Smell is a blast, deep rum and lots of dark fruits. Rich maltyness. A touch spicy as well. Complex, deep and powerful. 
T- Starts with a powerful malty flavor and some phenols show up as well. The initial thought was black cherry and rum. There is a bit of clove in there as well. Very sweet throughout and there is a certain leatheryness in the finish as well. 
Excessively boozy finish that is a bit hard to deal with. There is a certain butterscotchy flavor as well.
M- Thick and super syrupy, which was nice, but in the finish the alcohol just absolutely overwhelms everything. 
O- The alcohol is a kick in the mouth, but the flavors, aroma, and appearance of the beer are magnificent and if that doesn't make it a good beer I don't know what does. 862 charactersjsprain1, May 06, 2011

A: Pours thick, forming a lovely opaque dark coffee brown with a small but stable head. Plenty of sediment left in the bottle.
S: Much like the last beer I sampled from Rochefort, the aroma hit me as soon as I opened the bottle. Initially, I get molasses, along with dark cherries and - dare I say a hint of nutmeg? Wonderfully complex, the smell is a treat in itself.
T: SWEET. This has got to be the most sugary of the Belgian beers I've tried yet. The smell speaks for the taste almost perfectly - molasses, cherries, red wine, and a bit of spice. I would also add a dryer malty character towards the middle - reminiscient of dark grains, maybe pumpernickel. But honestly, with every sip, I seem to taste something different. At an impressive 11.3%, I can barely taste any alchohol.
M: Thick and slightly syrupy, very little carbonation. Doesn't get in the way of the flavor.
O: I was initially a little thrown off by the sweetness of it, but unlike other similar beers, once I got used to the flavor a bit, I had to stop myself from gulping it down. It may just be that I'm slowly learning to appreciate the style a little more after having the chance to try a few other trappist beers. In any case, the sheer complexity of the flavor is astounding. Highly reccomended! 1,298 charactersJoeyV, May 01, 2011
4.44/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Pours a dark brown with a very small tan head. Very minimal retention and lace.
Nose is a malty mix of caramel soaked dark bread, raisins, prunes, plum skin and chocolate. Bigtime yeasty anise note too.
Palate is thick and full-bodied, with big alcohol balanced by a big caramelly, brown sugar sweetness- more notes of prune with a slight dusting of coffee. The alcohol is big enough to seem unnoticeable after just a few sips as your whole body becomes enveloped in a warm glove of awesome. Hops are there but modest by comparison. There's also some subtle underlying phenolic plastic flavor. Finish is long and incredibly smooth.
Overall, one of the best. It must be good for me to like a beer made in one of my least favorite styles. Its complexity and balanced sweetness make it a very delicious brew. 808 charactersTheWhiskerReview, Apr 30, 2011

S: At first, I wasn't that impressed by the smell. However, as I let it open up a bit, the intensity of the smell grew. I'm getting brown sugar, tootsie roll, raisin and a hint of banana.
T: Very sweet and a bit hot on the finish. I'm getting some raisin and dark fruit and a lot of malty sweetness along with the thinnest hint of coffee on the finish. It leaves a drying and warming feeling on your tongue that tells you the alcohol is there. The mouthfeel is nice and creamy and not too syrupy, even as it warms. 624 charactersnotchucknorris, Apr 27, 2011

S: Brown sugar, damp boxwood, leather, cocoa, vanilla, hot alcohol.
T: Chocolate, biscuit malt, allspice, mace, brandy
M: Lots of "scrubbing bubbles," spritz, nice oily coat, a bit sweet
O: A bit sweet throughout. Very rich. I wager this could successfully sit in the cellar at least another year or two and only get better. Very hot, which detracts from its otherwise atractability. Good with chocolate ice cream. I bet it would also be a winner with roasted almonds or cashews. Or, a nice carbonnade, or venison (or lamb) with cherry sauce.
Don't drink it too cold or too quickly!
Not as polished a Quad as the Westy 12, but then again I've only had the Westy when cellared for twice as long as this one. 810 charactersdrperm, Apr 27, 2011

A word of advice: this beer improves immensely as it warms, and is best served at 55 degrees Fahrenheit.
A: Pours a dark brown with mahogany highlights. Small, creamy tan head with nice retention. No lacing on the glass.
S: Brown sugar and raisins knock you over the head. Smells very sweet and malty; almost like a barleywine.
T: Taste is of elderberry, spicy Belgian yeast and brown bread, with a nice, round dark fruit profile throughout. Finishes with strong toffee, caramel and heat from the alcohol. Truly a massive quad.
M: Creamy, with medium-light carbonation. Like silk on the tongue.
O: There's a cloying sweetness from start to finish here, which - although typical and expected - makes it difficult to drink a bottle of this in under an hour (not to mention its 11.3% ABV). That said, Trappistes Rochefort 10 is truly one of the best beers on the planet, and its regular availability makes it quite accessible (although a rare treat at $6.99 for an 11.2 oz bottle). Fans of St. Bernardus Abt. 12 and similar brews will surely find something to love in this.

Holiday Wine Cellar
Escondido, CA
A dark brown with ruby edges. Looks thick and relatively heavy in pour and glass. Big foaming tan head that sticks around and eventually leaves messy and sticky splatterings of lace down the glass. Really incredible looking beer!
The aroma is a divine cornucopia of dark fruits. The aromas of figs, raisins, and cherries are predominant. Something about this beer smells heavy and substantial, although I know those aren't typically words associated with aromas. It has a sweet and powerful aroma. While delicious, it doesn't possess quite the complexity or nuance I love about my favorite quads. 
The taste is similar to the nose. There's plenty of dark fruits along with some bitterness and an alcohol flavor akin to brandy. Smooth and easy to drink, even balanced, although this beer is thick, rich, and highly alcoholic.
Thick and rich mouthfeel with a touch of chew. A bit of alcohol warmth but at this ABV magnitude, that's a welcome addition.
A very, very good beer. I'm interested to see what a few more years in the cellar will do to this one. As it stands relatively fresh, it's a thick, rich, and delicious quad, though not quite as complex and interesting as some others. 1,237 charactersehammond1, Apr 21, 2011

4.4/5  rDev -1.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4I've heard a lot about this beer, so I figured I had to try it. Here's what I found.
A - A deep, rich brown. Even darker than I was expecting. There are faint reddish hues as well, with a very light head.
S - Mild aromas of nutty sweetness. Very appealing. The alcohol presence is very strong here.
T - An incredibly full-bodied experience here. A tinge of alcohol at first (which lingers throughout), touched with a hint of yeasty phenols, then finished off with some hazelnut/carmel aftershocks. The perfect definition of a Quad: it has an in-your-face grouping of flavors, but it all is done in a very mellow fashion. It's not harsh or overwhelming. Very nice, except for the balance: I feel that the alcohol presence is a bit overdone. It doesn't allow the other subtleties that make it great to come out. I know it's odd to be saying that with a 22 proof beer, but I think the 11.3% could have been more effectively blended. 
M - A tongue-numbing experience, that's for sure. Surprisingly bubbly, yet smooth. The alcohol warms on the way down and numbs the tongue. 
O - To be honest, I was a bit disappointed after all I had heard about this brew. It's a great example of a well-done Quad, but I don't think I'd be very keen on drinking it alone. As a dinner beer, perfect. 1,283 charactersBarryMFBurton, Apr 20, 2011
5/5  rDev +11.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I ordered this at Le Cirio in Brussels. Ruby-brown with a dense off-white head. Aromas of figs, cocoa, and herbal tea. Very full-bodied and creamy mouthfeel with an almost honey-like texture. Flavour is dark caramel-sweet with peppery spice upfront, followed by more figs, molasses, and a deep bready undercurrent. Complex and port-like but not overpowering. Westvletern 12 is reputed to be the best beer in the world in this style, but I think that reputation is likely enhanced by its rarity; I prefer Rochefort 10. 517 characters, Apr 20, 2011

A: Light brown with red highlights that you can almost start to see through. Not much head (thin, wispy) but there is a ton of carbonation funneling up the middle of the glass
S: Lots of dark fruit (raisin, fig) and bread malt. Some spiciness, presumably from the yeast. Hard to detect but I pick up some chocolate and maybe anise. Definitely no sign of alcohol
T: All the elements from the nose combine to make a wonderfully complex beer. Starts with a good dark fruit flavor that gently blends with some chocolate and brown sugar. A light spice and yeast component finishes it off
M: Full bodied yet the carbonation still is very present. Sweet dark fruit lingers on the palate ever so briefly after each sip
D: A wonderful quad. I had this before but didn't remember just how great of a beer it was. I understand why people hold this on par with Westy 12 902 charactersBrez07, Apr 20, 2011

Poured from the bottle into a Chimay goblet.
Appearance: At first glance this beer is darker then what I remember Westvleteren looked like. Definitely not opaque, if held up to the light it is red around the edges. There is a small layer of white head, but that fades to a nice lacing.
Smell: Lots of dark fruits, figs, raisins, malty goodness, and a touch of alcohol.
Taste: Lingering taste of figs and plums, with a nice sweetness derived from maltiness of this beer. There is a little more of an alcohol warming effect from this beer then from other trappist quads I have tried in the past, but it is a pleasant warming feeling, more inviting then anything.
Mouthfeel: The carbonation dances on your tongue, which is surprising from a beer that is this high in alcohol. It is still relatively light feeling, but still a sipper for sure.
Overall: I would highly recommend this beer. It's a world class example of the style and I'm sad that I will not be able to find them in Texas anymore. Worth seeking out if you can. 1,104 charactersjamescain, Apr 19, 2011

Smell: 4.5
Sweet molasses and sugar with caramel/bready malt and notes of dark fruit and chocolate. There is an especially prominent grape/plum note that increases as the beer warms. Overall, very pleasant.
Taste: 4.5
Dominated by dark fruits, with less sweetness than anticipated by the aroma. Through there is still is the molasses element of the malt present though. Moderate presence of alcohol, with notable warmth. Fnishes with slight bitterness and lingering astrigentness, similar to a good red wine.
Mouthfeel: 4
Smooth, mild carbonation with slight creaminess, but not overly viscous feel. Middle of the road with a balance between sweetness and dryness on tongue.
Drinkability/Overall: 4.5
Extremely drinkable despite high alcohol content 11.3%. I find it to be a complex, but very balanced beer. But it also pleasantly rich in taste, even in comparison to other quads such as St. Bernardus 12. Pairs with food, similar to a good red wine. 1,066 charactersEnemyWithin, Apr 19, 2011

A moderate pour yields a 2-finger tan-colored head that quickly recedes to a light dusting atop a thick mahogany-colored body. Thick floaties hang motionless like fruit pieces in Jello. A thick ring of foam clings to the edge of the glass but leaves little lacing.
Aromas of raisins and plums mix with a brown sugar scent.
Strong, sweet malt flavor, filled with dark fruit, assaults the palate first with a crisp spiciness. Then, a cider-like alcohol warmth and a molasses sweetness finish each sip.
Full bodied with high carbonation, this beer is a sipper and a half. Great drinkability, but the carbonation fizzes on the tongue a little excessively. 727 charactersoutput01x, Apr 18, 2011

Appearance: Dark woody, chocolaty brown hue. Completely opaque. One-finger coffee colored head.
Smell: Dark chocolate notes are the first thing I noticed. Brown sugar is very apparent as well. Smells sweet and malty. A little phenolic on the nose. Complex. Hints of black licorice and raisin. After swirling the glass, I got a quick subtle whiff of pumpkin. Very intriguing.
Taste: The alcohol and carbonation pack a big punch upon the arrival. Definitely a sipping beer. Dark chocolate, and dark fruit notes are made apparent after the initial punch subsides. Hints of toffee in the background. Very spicy, complex, boozy, and delicious. Slightly on the sweet side. There is a warming affect from the high ABV. The alcohol isn't masked very well, but it is consistent with the style. Lingering fruit/bitter chocolate driven finish. Beautiful blend amongst all of the characteristics. They all stand out in their own way. Nothing is too overwhelming. Excellent brew.
Mouthfeel: Medium to full bodied with high carbonation. Smooth, yet prickly. On the thick side.
Ending notes: This beer is a must try for any beer enthusiast. I could spend an hour discovering all of the characteristics, as there as so many present. What a phenomenal take on the quadrupel style. Outstanding. 1,329 charactersjboucher, Apr 17, 2011

Because of this, I decided to go all out in the beer that I would review. This one seems to be quite the massive feat.
Pours a gentle black, head quickly dissipating. Smell is fruity and rich in ..hmm, I'd hate to say "those Belgan-y smells", but for all of the belgian ales I've had, they've shared these similar qualities. 
First sip is quite surprising. I'd never expect a beer with such a high gravity to be this absolutely smooth. It really does have a velvety smoothless to it that I wasn't expecting. 
Mouthfeel is subtle, yet extremely satisfying. In terms of trappist ales, this takes the cake as the best I've tried. It really is something to behold. 684 characterstechfed87, Apr 17, 2011

Poured to NB globe.
A: Pours a dark maple brown. Two finger acorn head dissipates to thick comforter of fine, thick foam. This foam quilt sticks around permanently. Loose lacing.
S: Mixtures of molasses, brown sugar, nougat, malts, grain, earthy and noble hops. Hints of butter. This opens up and retains beautifully throughout the life. On the second tasting I've done, this beer had a lovely buttered toast tone to it.
T: Earth, malt, molasses, warmth (ABV), sweetness constantly beaten back by low bittering. This beer doesn't hide the alcohol as I would expect for such renowned a brewery. 
M: heavy body, decent carbonation. Leaves the palate quite slick.

4.47/5  rDev 0%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured into a small tulip.
A - A very very deep brown color with lighter hues when held up to the light. Not black but very dark. There is a very nice head taht forms 2.5 fingers in my tulip but it eventually dies to a single thin ring.
S - An incredible carmalized sugar malt sweetness right off the bat. This is mixed with a plethora of dark fruits including cherry, fig, raisin. There is a slight rum smell on the back end, but the finish is clearly and herby pepper that finishes it very nicely.
T & M - Awesome awesome quad. The beer mimics the nose very well. The front end is a boom of carmalized sugary flavors and cherries and toffee like malt. There is even a deep chocolate taste that is very subtle but nice in the middle of the palate. The back end becomes almost herbal with a slight peppery finish. What is suprising is the lightness of the finish of the beer. It is medium bodied but finishes so thin and light on the palate making it very drinkable.
O - Wow what a quad. The nose and the mouth are very complex and robust. It is a sipper for sure. It suprises becuase all the complex flavor and the ABV are hidden by a very light finish and great mouth feel. These are easy to find and I recommend you grab one. Always a treat.

I'm very happy to try this legendary quad.
A: Poured a deep deep brown. Fully translucent. Almost as dark as a stout. Head is beige, good retention and correct lacing.
S: Darker than any other quads I ever had. Very strong toffee presence as well as molasses and licorice. Also pretty strong with the nuts. But the main players (as with most quads). Dates (quite strong), plums, raisins and dried cherries are very present. Nectarines and maybe over riped peach. Spiced bread : bread, brown sugar, cinnamon, cardamom and cloves. Red apples. Incredibly complex, but the smell ain't strong enough for the 5.
T: Again, very strong with the toffee, molasses, licorice, nuts, dates, plums raisins, dried cherries, bread, brown sugar, cinnamon, cardamom, cloves (aka the definition of a quad). But, with the nectarines, over riped peaches, a perfect balance of the tastes, sweet without never getting cloying, strong taste without getting overwhelming, no alcohol in sight, it is the perfect tasting quad (still didn't have westy 12 yet though).
M: Very full and creamy body. Not sticky at all (like all Belgian beer) which is quite exceptional considering the 11.2 ABV. Carbonation is medium to low. Hard to put in words, but this is IMO the perfect quad feel.
O: What more can I say? It really is a legendary beer and for good reason. One of the best I ever had. And maybe has the award for the most drinkable beer with an above 10 ABV. 1,478 charactersflipper2gv, Apr 12, 2011

Appearance: Appears a dark brown and murky. Cracking off white head forms and leaves a fine film that lasts the duration.
Smell: Bready, fig like and well pronounced notes of dark fruit just emit from the chalice. Quite pleasing to the senses.
Taste: Strong malty presence, high alcohol shows itself in a way that was not apparant in the nose. The notes of dark fruit have emerged as candied date, fig and red grape. Ever so slight hint of a roasted flavor in the malt. Dry cocoa. Nice.
Mouthfeel: Lighter bodied and quite "juicy". Carbonation levels are fine, some chalky yeast presence.
Overall: Initially I enjoyed all aspects of this beer, but after consuming the enitre bottle, I enjoy them all the more. 738 charactersStinkypuss, Apr 11, 2011
4.33/5  rDev -3.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5I've been sampling this beer since I bought about a dozen or so of them 2 years ago. This bottle aged 2 years...time to review:
A: Poured into my chalice, this brew pours a dark chocolate murky brown with yeasty sediment leaving a freckle like appearance throughout the beer.
S: The aroma consist of a heavy Belgium spice and clove. Over the two years notes of light chocolate have emerged. Organic notes of biscuit and the caramel start to make themselves more evident.
T: The flavor becomes more solid over the years. Dark fruit, raisins and plumbs are first followed by an interesting alcohol note. Pleasantly tiny notes of chocolate and caramel end at the back of the pallet.
MF: Maybe a little too much carbonation, but full like a Belgium should be.
Overall, this brew continues to be in my top 3 no matter how many IPAs, Stouts, or other great brews I have the luxury of trying. My biggest gripe with Rochefort 10 is that sometimes I get a bottle that is noticeably better than every other. Can't wait to see how the 7 I have left age out over the years. 1,066 charactersTKEbeerman, Apr 10, 2011
4.8/5  rDev +7.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Poured into my favorite tulip glass at slightly-higher-than-cellar temp to experience every side of this brew. Use By date is 04/28/15. This is my first Trappist beer, and to say I'm excited to try it would be an understatement!
A: Deep, rich brown, nearly opaque, with some tiny ruby highlights that sneak through when held up to a light. Huge foamy creamy tan head that slowly shrinks down to a thick film and ring that hugs the glass. Little-to-no lacing.
S: Toffee, scorched caramel, raisins, dates & figs, clove, rock candy and brown sugar, tobacco, and a dank, cave-like quality; sort of musty - smells like history. There's a little bit of alcohol vapor poking through, but it merely lends itself as a warming, slightly peppery quality. Sweet and dark and delicious.
T: Heaven in a glass. So rich and complex - toffee and caramel, brown sugar, molasses, raisins and dates, cloves, sweetened condensed milk, dark chocolate, smooth toddy-brewed coffee, rock candy, musty mildew, and a nice round warming sensation from the alcohol - it's so incredibly well-hidden; really only noticeable well after a sip. Very sweet and rich. The quintessential fireside sipper - take it all in slowly; savor every nuance. Study it and reflect on your day. Quads (heck, any style of beer) don't get much better than this. 
M: Incredibly smooth; chewy, thick, and creamy. Low carbonation lends a rich and decadent experience.
O: In a word - Magnificent. Easily the best Quad I've tasted yet, and certainly in the top 10 beers that I have ever had. I'll be picking up more of these to savor & cellar.
To quote my friend @joshkennedy: Bravo, Monks. 1,640 charactersmachostacos, Apr 10, 2011
4.55/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5poured into a fresh unibroue tulip. this one has a lot of kudos surrounding it. poured at room temperature on a cold Melbourne day. About 15 degrees. i bought 2 of these about a year ago, one was to age, one to drink. This is the one i finally got around to drinking, which will be compared to the other which will hopefully be drank closer to the used by date (01/06/15) if it makes it. iI'm excited about this one.
A- pours vey dark, pretty much black, but if held up to the light it lets the tiniest bit through. about an inch of head that quickly turns into nothing but a line around the rim. excellent. 
S- Toffee, raisin, alcohol is definitely there but in a good way. lots and lots of malt sweetness. both biscuity and jammy at the same time, with a touch of golden syrup. no hop smell at all. this is pure malt brilliance, with the slightest bit of yeast in the background.
T- Very Very Malty straight up. biscuity with a bunch of sweetness following soon after. some yeasty fruitiness follows, dried apricot, dates. Lots of raisin in there, alcohol for sure, but it blends in great. a little bit of spice, pepper and clove. intense flavour, that benefits from sipping slowly and thinking about. 
M- very thick, almost syrupy. Creamy, but theres still a touch of prickly carbonation. very drying at the end, but the length is outstanding. im still tasting it ages after each mouthful.
O- Wow. this beer has a reputation that precedes it, and naturally that made me somewhat apprehensive. But this lives up to its name, and really delivers something special. i would never have more than one in an evening, but its one i would sit on for a long time. undoubtedly one of the worlds best beers 1,703 charactersshambeano, Apr 09, 2011

A- 2 finger off white head, Dark brown with hints of red shining through, attractive lacing that sticks to the side of the glass, moderate carbonation.
S- Sweet, dark fruit aroma, plums, raisons, wow amazing smell
T- Just a big complex beer, sweetness comes out right away, caramel, alcohol is their but not over powering, hints of plum and raison as well, almost a candy taste to it, brown sugar, very rich.
M- Full mouth feel, dry aftertaste, very smooth
O- Wow, truly a great Trappist beer, haven't had it since I was in Belgium almost 4 months ago, I feel like I forgot how good this was. It truly is a complex delicious brew. Need to try it alongside Westy 12 in the future. 715 charactersChriscrundwell12, Apr 09, 2011
4.65/5  rDev +4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured from the bottle into my DFH Snifter
A--Poured a dark, dark brown. It looks opaque actually. Also had a massive head on it that is an off-white color. It stayed throughout the beer without any retention on the glass. 
S--The smell is incredible. The nose is hit with warm spices. I sense pepper, clove, banana, dark fruits (plum, raisins), brown sugar, and something like cinnamon or nutmeg. 
T--Awesome. This is one of the best Quads I have ever tasted. Get a bit of yeast in the initial sip. The whole drink just makes me feel warm. Spicy is all I can think of for this beer. It tastes of pepper, allspice, banana, and clove. 
M--It is very thick in the mouth. I can taste some carbonation, but mostly I just get a warm feeling throughout the drink. Probably from the high alcohol content. 
O--This is probably the best quad I have ever tried. It has an amazing smell and taste. Just be wary of the alcohol. It's hidden very well. 943 charactersMosley1212, Apr 09, 2011
4.5/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A: Pours a cloudy brown with a nice smooth, but light head.
S: The smell has hints of brown sugar, caramel, a variety of sweet fruits including apple. I also get the tiniest sense of something funky in there as if it might have been stored somewhere that was too warm. Let's hope the taste does not reflect that. 
T: So smooth and well balanced. The taste matches the maltiness its color implies. Its sugary without being sweet...if that's possible, which it is. I just experienced it. For an 11.3% beer, it sure doesn't bite that way. For what I smelled of fruit stands out in the form of figs. As for the storage worry, it's there, but barely noticeable. Overall, the taste has many characteristics without being complex. 
M: A nice buttery feel. It's quite smooth for a beer this strong. 
O: This is a fantastic beer!!! It's weird, as high as I rate this beer, I don't feel I gave it a description that would reflect that. I think that's what impresses me so much. Its great in the right simple ways...ways that require the experience of monks that have been brewing since 1595. I had this beer once before and I remember it being better so I'll have to give it a third try sometime. 1,190 charactersCaptainren, Apr 08, 2011

4.59/5  rDev +2.7%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Good god what a nose this has. Beautiful deep plummy figgy chocolately nose. So profound and complex. If the aroma could speak it would sound like James Earl Jones.
Pours a deep red brown with almost purply highlights and eventually yields a constant thin light foamy head.
Tastes remarkably as it smells. Very rich like having your mouth massaged by velvet. Body is slightly acidic yet firm to start but in time it integrates and leads to an outstandingly long sappy sweet soft smoothness.
Big and profound but very very classy. 532 charactersZimbo, Apr 05, 2011
4.58/5  rDev +2.5%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Appearance: Nice, dark cloudy brown. About a finger and a half of cafe-colored head. Recedes quickly.
Smell: Right away I'm hit with an aroma of roasted molasses and figs. Definitely candied fruits like red apples and raisins. A hint of caramel.
Taste: Wow, the first sip is so complex. I'm getting roasted coffee, caramel, raisins, a little bit of chocolate, and brown sugar. The sweetness is almost cloying, but not annoyingly so. This is a very warming beer - I could easily sip this by the fire or drink my fill of this brew. It's definitely well-balanced - constantly flips back and forth between different fruits and malty flavors. 
Mouthfeel: So smooth - its subtle carbonation disappears as the full flavors take over. Starts like a crisp ale and finishes like a milky stout - albeit a little astringent and cloying, but completely enjoyable.
Overall, this is an excellent beer. It doesn't smell nearly as good as it tastes, which is surprising. It might be a little too sweet for those who enjoy Double/Triple IPAs, but this beer is topping my charts - hard to beat it. Alcohol wastes no time kicking in at 11.3% and I hardly even realized it.
Bravo, monks. 1,171 charactersthecheekybrewer, Apr 05, 2011
3.56/5  rDev -20.4%look: 2 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.25 |  overall: 3.75Served at 55 degrees F in a chalice. 
Its color was a very dark burgundy. Looks almost like a dark nut brown ale. The head was not substantial. It faded to an almost nonexistent film. 
I smelled fig, molasses, apple, candied dark fruits. It's on the sweet side with a buttery undertone. 
Its taste matches the aroma . The flavor profile is complex but balanced fairly well, if not a bit sweet. The sweetness hit me first, with notes of fruit and brown sugar. The profile fades slowly to a smooth caramel malt with notes of brown sugar rearing its head again at the end. 
Mouthfeel is fairly creamy and appropriate for a quad, but a bit slick. Carbonation comes alive when combined in the mouth with food, especially a jam or jelly. 
Drinkability is pretty good. The above average sweetness may be an obstacle to some, but the high ABV is hidden beautifully, so that's a wash. 880 charactersjbertsch, Apr 04, 2011

Smell: Nice dark malty aroma with caramel hints. I think I also get a raisin scent in there too.
Taste: Starts very nice and I can definitely tell this is going to be a strong sipping beer! The second drink definitely hid the alcohol much better. Well balanced dark malty taste. This beer gets better and more complex with every drink!!
Mouthfeel: Nice and clean on the palate. Finished really smooth. 
Overall: I think this is a great beer. I will definitely crack another one of these real soon. 583 charactersgratefuld, Apr 03, 2011
4.63/5  rDev +3.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Review #1000.
Semi sweet fruit aroma. Very consistent. Hints of phenol. Soft alcohol.
Huge full dark head. Couldn't completed bottle on first pour into a Chimay goblet. Very dark body, looking near black with dark red held in light. Lots of floating yeast.
OMG so smooth. Again the deep fruit with a creamy flavor that resembles vanilla (and comes across like fruit and cream). The alcohol is quite concealed yet offers an enjoyable warmth. A nicely fading flavor with minimal bitterness. A slowly fading fruit.
Exceptional feel with full yet incredibly soft carbonation. Body is moderate, but that's so underwhelming a descriptor as the feel is sublime.
I've had more complex beers. I've had more flavorful beers. But none have done better with mixing the pleasure of the flavors and the unbelievable mouthfeel. I can't give a 5 for overall since a guy couldn't make a night of these (it would end early - although it would make an enjoy, albiet quick night). I'm glad I saved this for this personally important event. It was truly exceptional and I will buy this beer for another special occasion.
Best by date 160713, so I must have received this about 2008 (thanks Linda). 1,176 charactersgarymuchow, Apr 02, 2011

Smell - Slight vinegar scent and pronounced dark fruit sweetness.
Taste - Plenty of complexity. I was seriously caught off guard with this beer. This is the most highly regarded beer (according to BA) that I've had so far. Very hidden alcohol. 
Mouthfeel - Lively on the tongue, despite the general lack of carbonation. Full body.
Overall Drinkability - Highly drinkable. Very smooth, especially considering the ABV. 538 charactersZenAgnostic, Mar 29, 2011

S-caramelized belgian sugars. has a slight burnt scent to it. good strength
T-comes in with a potent hit of caramelized belgian sugars. it definitely tastes like a really strong beer. the more i drink it, the stronger it comes. the after-taste is filled with bananas and grapes. its definitely not as great as people make it out to be, i think the ABV hits too hard.
M-thick high carbonation with a dry finish
D-well this is definitely a sipper. i wasn't too impressed with this one compared to other dark belgians. it just doesn't go down easily. it was actually sorta difficult to finish. It is unique though and complex. Though its not my favorite. It's something I'll be coming back to every once in awhile. 758 charactersAdamBear, Mar 27, 2011

S: a deep caramel malt notes, some roast and fruitm, i would say raisin and plums
T: what a balanced beer, there is sweet, there is bitter and there is alcohol presence, but you never get too much of anything, it feels great on throat.

A - Pours deep dark brown with a huge fizzy two finger off white head, dissipating down to a thick film, leaving thin sheets of lacing down the glass.
S - Smells of rich dark fruits like raisins and dates, candied sugar, banana, dulled chocolate, light spice, and some light alcohol heat. Very nice overall balance. I have had this fresh but I think I now prefer it aged for a few years.
T - Flavors are similar to the nose with the addition of a bit more booze. The balance of dark fruits, candied sweetness, and light heat is a nearly flawless. The finish is a bit dry with a mix of sweetness and dulled heat, lingering for a short while. Overall this is one of the best trappist quad's you can find. I have had this fresh, and while it is still good, I think it just gets better with age.
M - Heavy body and flavor with moderate carbonation. Full bodied with some dryness. Finish is a mix of dark fruit sweetness and some dulled alcohol burn.
O - Pretty good. I have had a few of these now and I think I prefer it aged. When it is fresh the booze is a bit overpowering but after a few years it really seems to die down. I am glad I stashed this one in my cellar. One of the best for sure. 1,343 charactersorangesol, Mar 24, 2011

Tastes malty and fruity with a strong alcoholic undertone that perks up the nose hairs on the exhale. Slight toffee flavor and a touch of grain. Fairly balanced, though leaning toward the sweet side as expected. Slightly dry finish. 
Prickly carbonation. Medium bodied.
Very good, but not as good as all the hype. For the money I would take an Ommegang Three Philosophers or St. Bernie 12 over this every time. 564 charactersHoagie1973, Mar 23, 2011

I was pleasantly surprised that he had this beer to start with. It poured a nice dark out in my goblet. Had a sniff, so much complexity in terms of smells, yet simply sweet. 
Very good first taste, tasted fruity, nutty and yet a little spicy (pardon me if I am a little wrong. It's been 2 weeks since and I had another 2 more Trappist beers on that day). Aftertaste was nice and fragrant. 
Very much a beer to drink SLOWLY. Not for the weak hearted as this is a very strong beer. Recommended as a later drink in your beer course to end it all with. (I started with Chimay Red - Orval - Rochefort 10) 798 charactersbearish, Mar 22, 2011

4.5/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5It's my birthday and 300th review at the same time; good enough an excuse to open what will become the most highly-reviewed beer on BA I've written up. Bottle dated: 050214 14:47. I'm guessing that's a best before 2014? Poured into a Duvel tulip. 
Rochefort 10 displays an opaque nutty-mahogany body with a good cover of creamy beige head (especially for its ABV) sticking around until the last drops (and easily replenished with a swirl of the glass). Not too much lacing. Lots of tiny solids are suspended throughout. I'm not sure I've ever seen a beer this colour before; beautiful stuff. 
The nose is mostly all malty goodness: rum-soaked raisins, strawberry shortcake, cinnamon bun, demerarra sugar. Very bready and sweet but cut with just enough earthy hops. 
Taste is very similar to the nose, with tons of malt balanced with a solid hop backing. Simultaneously incredibly complex and balanced. Bready malt, raisins and figs in the mouth; drying dark pine, cocoa powder and cinnamon stick on the finish. Alcohol does show but it blends in pretty well; maybe I would have left this to age another year or two, ideally, to really smooth out all the alcohol. 
Typical amazing Trappist mouthfeel. Silky, creamy medium body with low-moderate carbonation. 
This is one of the few beers I've had that really tastes like a work of art. Obviously it's not sessionable by anyone's definition; I would probably never want more than two or three in one sitting. Still, it's supremely drinkable for what it is. I'm not generally a big fan of quadrupels but this is an amazing brew. 1,580 characterseat, Mar 22, 2011

S: I'm getting a yeasty, bready, caramel, dark fruit smell going on. It smells like a...tart, jam filled doughnut, or something like it.
T: The initial taste is a very smooth sort of black currant, with the middle filling out a more raisin note, and the lingering taste is almost a dark berry or fig sort of note, but at the same time creamy and barleyish. It tastes *$&%in great.

O: Excellent. For guys that don't drink, these monks are doing an excellent job. I didn't even know about that a subtype of belgian ales called quadrupel existed, but I'm glad I discovered this. 
I actually came to know of this one's existence through a guy on one of the forums I'm on, and he's always raving about a "Rocheforte 10" that he's drinking...and after looking into it, I got myself a bottle and here we are. Excellent brew. 1,036 charactersKrakistophales, Mar 18, 2011

T- WOW!!! Dark fruits, sugars, caramels, it's all there. It's incredibly complex but at the same time so simple. Wonderful smooth finish. I could drink this down and never get tired of it.

M: Medium body and carbonation, this beer is nice and crisp, belying its gravity.

No alcohol flavor even in the slightest. Flavor lasts forever. Not my style of beer and probably will never have again, but very worthwhile to experience. 451 charactersarkurzynski, Mar 15, 2011
4.95/5  rDev +10.7%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5This is strongest and most memorable of the Belgian strong dark ales I've had. Pours dark, smells strong. The first two or three sips you really notice the alcohol, but also the amazing flavor. As you go through the glass, the alcohol fades to the background, and you are left with a fantastic, complex taste. By the end of one bottle, all I thought of was having another. Two are doable, but hard to imagine a 3rd. This is a truly special beer. 445 charactersChestSplitter, Mar 15, 2011
4.58/5  rDev +2.5%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from an 11.2 ounce bottle into a Duvel tulip. A massive 2 fingers up buttercream head formed on top of the purple/mahogany body. The bubble on bubble formation of the head slowly dissipated, leaving behind tons of lace. Insane legs. 
The nose has tons of dark fruits...figs, raisins, plums. The backround finds a deep, sticky caramel aroma. 
The flavor falls in line with the nose almost perfectly. The dark fruits dominated up front...sugary center gives way to a still sweet but boozy finish. 
The mouth feel borders between medium and thick...somewhat astringent with a dry finish.
It's easy to tell why this is one of the highest rated beers out there... super tasty and complex...the boozy finish is the only thing that holds is down a little. 759 charactersmgbickel, Mar 15, 2011
4/5  rDev -10.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4A- Pours a dark brown color with a one finger tan head. Good retention and sparse lacing. 
S- Bunch of sweet caramel malts with large amount of candy sugar up front. Plenty of dark fruit follow, raisins. Nice belgian yeast also comes into play toward the end. 
T- Brown sugar is the first thing I pick up, then darker fruits with with black cherrie and raisin. A bit of spicy character to it as well. 
M- Medium mouthfeel, but somehow more slick then other beers. 
D- This beer is one of the best for the style that I've tried, everything in balance, makes you want to go back for more. 590 characterschilly460, Mar 15, 2011
5/5  rDev +11.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Had this one in my beer cellar since I purchased it in 2007. That makes it at least 4 years old.
Appearance - A refreshing hiss emerged as I gently removed the cap. Dark amber, bronze in color. The tan head only forms a slightly less than one-finger depth, but it lasts, and lasts. The fine carbonation feeds the retention of a modest 1/4 inch head long after I finish the pour. It appears "nice legs" would be a correct phrase to use to describe the lasting carbonation, even after aging it as long as I have. 
Smell - Yeast, bready, figs, plumbs, some zesty aromas as well. Perhaps pears is the best way of describing this amazing nose. Very refreshing. Light, but at the same time multifaceted. 
Taste - ok, the head is still present. This is impressive. Oh wait, I'm supposed to talk about the taste. Rich, fruity, very complex in the sense that there is some much going on. ok...anise..yes, anise is predominate. Also some sweet caramel as well. Figs as well. what the hell? The head is still present? wow...impressive. Roasty malt/barley comes through as well. Not even a hint of a boozy quad hit on this one. No wonder the monks were happy after quaffing this one and why they saved it for special occasions. The malty goodness shines through. No hint of ABV here. Amazing.
Mouthfeel - Creamy, (oh did I mention the head is still present?) moderate density. Not too harsh/dense, while not too wispy. 
Drinkability - You know, with the multitude of varieties that are "beer", you should not overlook some of the classic styles that you can point to and say, "That will stand the test of time, fads, opinions, etc." This, my friends, is one of them. Should all all things pass away (i.e. barrel-aging, mad "over-hopping", twists on styles (i.e. lemongrass instead of coriander in a witbier)), go back and look to the roots of a style. You will be impressed with what time has provided as a standard/yardstick by which all others are to be measured. I cannot believe this is as easily available as it is. I can go down to my local beer store and by this. Go now and do the same. I challenge you to do so. Apart from a Westy 12, this is the my top pick for best representing the style. It beats the Westy 12 only because I can go and buy it now.
p.s. Yes, the head is still present. What is this made of? 2,313 charactersNesued, Mar 15, 2011
4.74/5  rDev +6%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Big treat for me, and I was worried about how the beer would open after coming from a monestary in Belgium. Perfect open with a cloud of carbination hovering over the inside rim of the bottle. The smell was amazing- plum, banana, fig. Normally I am not great at picking up tastes and flavors, but you can tell this is a great beer because it makes you become a connoisseur. I was not sure if the beer would live up to my expectations, but this beer has, and is, as I have read, addictive. The taste is so complex, and the flavors you smell are the same ones you taste. All this at 11.3%. I want to let it warm to see how the flavors come out, but it is hard to let it sit there without me drinking it. 
I made the right choice on this one. Well worth the price. 761 charactersGlibber, Mar 14, 2011

Back to the smell. Malty, caramel with some fruitiness. The taste is so damn good! Carbonated, but can't really taste the strong alcohol. Very smooth, malty, carmel taste. Getting slight fruity hints. Drinkability isn't really an issue, since this is a small bottle, and at $5 plus dollars I'm only having one. Awesome beer. God bless those Belgians! 465 charactersDrStiffington, Mar 13, 2011
4.13/5  rDev -7.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Poured out of a bottle into Westvleteren goblet. 
Appearance: Great deep brown color with an off white creamy looking head. One finger of head that dissipates to about a half finger. Good lacing
Smell: Malty, sweet, raisin, brown sugar, light alcohol. Overall a wonderful deep and well balanced scent.
Taste: Wow. This gem fills your mouth with great rich carbonated fruit and raisin flavors. Extremely well balanced with a slight alcohol warming sensation at the end. Tons of rich and big flavors.
Mouthfeel: The brew is very carbonated so it fills the mouth a lot. Smooth and leaves a nice coating around the mouth. 
Drinkability: Way too drinkable for teh ABV but still it is 11.3% so not thee most drinkable. Still a dangerously good beer.
Overall a wonderful beer and I feel very underated because it is so easy to get a hold of. Call me crazy but I think it is the next closest beer to the Westy 12 for this style; still a step below though 948 charactersscoand, Mar 13, 2011

A - comes out a nice dark brown with a minute reddish hue to it. very little light getting through the sediment. nice 1/4 inch head that sticks around endlessly.
S - dark fruits (plum and cherry stick out in particular). smells quite like a sherry.
T - again dark fruits (figs), alcohol is very present here but its not overpowering. you can also taste the malts in the back. 
M - a lot of carbonation here but its definitely not too much carbonation. gets the perfect amount of fizz off the tongue. very smooth drink
D - super sipping beer. obviously the ABV is gonna limit the amount of these you can have but the ones you do have are gonna go down so easily.
superb quality in this. can see why it is so highly regarded and so expensive to boot. 787 characterscelticfutblclub, Mar 12, 2011
4.49/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4I think I had tried this once before but never a full bottle. It was very early in my beer drinking career.
11.2 oz bottle. 260814 printed on it.
It pours a dark, deep brown with a slight hue of red. There is a lot of sediment. The head is foamy and off-white/tan with tons of dirty looking sediment. It looks rustic and I like it.
The smell is so great. It just smells like an amazing dessert with mainly dark fruits, kirsch, sherry, loads of caramel, sweet dark bread, some cocoa, perfumey floral notes, rum toffee, spices, and port. It is just a intoxicating perfume.
The flavor is nearly as good. It has a huge kirsch/sherry/port flavor to it with that alcoholic kick, but it is like you are drinking a 18% liqueur clocking in at just over 11%. There is some nuttiness that comes through more-so in the taste that blends with the alcohol , bready malt,and dark fruit notes for a luscious decadent dessert flavor. The caramel also comes though with some sweetness on the back end.
It has an intriguing liqueur presence about it that takes it to a high level. The mouthfeel is smooth but with a prickle of carbonation.
A divine brew. 1,141 characterscrossovert, Mar 10, 2011
4.32/5  rDev -3.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured into the glass, the beer is very dark brown and hazy. The tan head is huge, with big bubbles of CO2 puffing their way through the top. Pretty enjoyable to watch. 
The aroma is malty and sweet with dark brown sugar and a healthy dose of phenols. 
Medium-heavy bodied, creamy and sweet. Figs, prunes, raisins, dark bread, a slight smokiness and mild phenols. Some leafy hops, warming alcohol and peppery spice in the finish. 
A great beer. I could sip on this thing all night. Unfortunately that would probably be a bad idea considering the ABV. 553 charactersSuperSpy, Mar 10, 2011
3.81/5  rDev -14.8%look: 4 | smell: 3 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4A few years ago I had all three of the Rochefort's and well, did not like them. For some odd reason I didn't write any notes on the 10 so here I am giving this another shot, after a few hundred (thousand?) different beers I may have developed more of a palette for this one. We shall see.
Served in a Chimey glass.
Pours a dark brown color, leaving a near black but not fully black body, a decent head forms full of tiny extremely compact bubbles, that quickly leaves and leaves marginal lacing and a tan film over the body of the beer. Swirling leaves carbonation that slowly drizzles down back into the glass, nothing staying on the glass itself. 
Bitter/sour notes give way to dark fruits and subtle dark malt aromas. I am having a hard to placing any of these aromas. There is a vanilla creamy caramel effect (sounds too American to be right) that subdues the fruit aromas and leaves me a bit in the dark here.
Opening with a sweet yet sweet even till nearly the back of the tongue cream candy caramel chocolate type malt/yeast flavor. The flavors are very cream like at the front of the tongue and darker and deeper towards the back, finally finishing with a bitter hop kiss. This is amazing candy like in natures. I fully understand why I disliked this in the past. I disliked this in the past, it is just simply too sweet. It is like a glass of amazing candy/alcohol. I have apparently become far too much of a gluten because today I'm rather impressed by this tasty treat. 
D.	There is still a hell of an alcohol kick to open this bad boy. I worry that the subtle hops to finish it will leave forever if I were to age a bottle too long. The flavors mix so well that I would fear age simply dulling the intense flavors present. Not sure the age with 280415 written on the bottle. One would assume that's the best by, but I don't know how many years they claim this one lasts. 
M Creamy, thick, smooth and just wonderful. I could use a bit of a bit from hops, can't lie, but just wonderful stuff. 
This is a treat to say the least. Looks like 6 and 8 need to be re-reviewed, hell I might give Chimay Blue a shot....though I found it unimpressive fairly recently. 2,175 charactersbobhits, Mar 09, 2011

Poured a muddy dark brown with little bits of yeast floating with a large frothy tan head that was quickly dissipating and had fair lacing. The aroma was of a roasted bread malts, light herbal hops and a doughy yeast with notes of molasses, plums, figs and raisons. It tasted wonderfully malty-sweet at first with a hint of molasses with a the finish being bitter-sweet with notes of dried fruit and had a mild alcohol twinge. Mouthfeel was medium to full in body and quite creamy in texture with a soft carbonation. Overall an outstanding strong ale, defintely worth trying!! 611 charactersKajII, Mar 09, 2011

4.2/5  rDev -6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Bottle was stamped with 030215.
A- 4 Poured a murky, dark chocolatey brown color with a minimal but smooth off-white head. The lacing isn't super sticky but a ring of foam clings around the edges of the glass. Bits of sediment are suspended throughout the body of the brew evenly (I poured it too fast, but they settled to the bottom).
S- 4 Yeast, caramel, roasted and nutty malts, and just a hint of booze. It also has a scent similar to red wine; a dark fruity aroma.
T- 4.5 Even sweeter than I imagined from the aroma. It is malty but balanced with a candy-like sweetness and a mild bitterness. There is also a taste of dark fruit. The yeast is definitely present as well. Just a touch of booze on the finish reminds you this is a strong one. It is not as nutty as I expected from its aroma.
M- 4 This brew is very smooth. It is a nice medium body with good carbonation. It is slightly syrupy on the finish.
D- 4 This is a very good beer and I can see why it is touted so highly. It isn't too heavy and I could see myself having a couple of these in a sitting. Because of its strong flavors and ABV, though, it's probably not one that you'd drink all night. It should be enjoyed for what it is and appreciated one at a time. I'd like to have this one again to try and pick up on more of its subtleties. 1,310 charactersKYBrewgrass, Mar 08, 2011

S: Strong vinous quality: really has a rich oaky red wine aroma at first but also plenty of dark fruits--plums, prunes, dates, etc; some orange as well as a pleasant spiciness--coriander for sure; this is a gorgeous smelling beer
T: Acidic vinous flavors off the bat with loads of dark fruits as the aromas indicated; the alcohol is well masked but its presence helps to numb the roof of the mouth; there is a wonderful malty backbone but the semi-sweet dark fruits and wine flavors steal the show; mmm
F: Perfect amount of carbonation; silky smooth mouth coating
D: The 11.3% doesn't show...at first; of course this is a slow sipping, monster beer but it is so smooth and warms the soul so nicely; one of the best beers in the world, period. 886 charactersdbossman, Mar 07, 2011

4.48/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Intro: 11.2 oz. bottle served in a tulip glass 
Appearance: Dark, rich chocolate brown with a thin, light tan head that dissipates rather quickly. Moderate carbonation. Moderate lacing is also present but slides down the glass rather quickly which is indicative of some oiliness. Some yeast sediment was detected in the bottom of my glass.
Smell: The aroma is slightly subdued but still layered, and complex, with a host of different ingredients. Initially, I detect dark fruits, caramel, brown sugar, malts, and spice. As the pour warms, the bouquet opens up slightly. The alcohol is hidden rather well but is still detected.
Taste: Like the smell, I taste dark fruits, brown sugar, and the sharp taste of spice. I could also taste the roasted flavor of the malts which also added a certain sharpness to the palette. The taste of alcohol is present and not as well hidden in this beer.
Mouthfeel: Crisp and clean with moderately high carbonation without an aftertaste. Only a very slight oiliness is perceived. The alcohol is present but not overbearing.
Drink: Very smooth and leaves you wanting more. Went down pretty fast for being a rather high ABV. The alcohol is not overpowering but the beer should still be a sipper. A dessert beer.
Conclusion: One can tell this beer is the culmination of years of development. It is a rich, complex beer that needs a couple of sessions to really appreciate the nuances and complexity. I consider this to be in my all-round top 10 list, right below St. Bernardus Abt 12 and I will always keep an ample supply to break out and enjoy with friends. 1,595 charactersheysuz, Mar 06, 2011
3.99/5  rDev -10.7%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.511.2oz bottle poured into a Westvleteren chalice. 
A - Pours that muddy brown color, almost like swamp water, familiar to many other quads. A nice 1-fingered head builds before calming down into about a 2cm cap that rings around the glass. There's some lacing, but for the most part it's fairly sparse.
S - Smell is complex and bold, with lots of various characteristics going on. Almost instantly I get a butterscotch, buttery caramel at the beginning that reminds of the butterbomb Rochefort 8 I had, but fortunately it's much more toned down here. I'm also getting a lot of sweet, candied, dark fruits, especially grapes and plums. There's also a bit of an alcohol burn in the back as well but it meshes well with the rest of the beer.
T - Given the butterscotch in the nose, I was bracing for the worst for the taste, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that this beer has a very nice flavor to it. The butterscotch at first whets the palate and prepares it for the sweet ride it's subject to following the malts, Belgian yeast, candied sugar, and the multitude of fruits. It's hard to pick out specific notes as everything melds nicely together, but the plums stand out the most for me. It's a bit sugary, not to the extent that St. Bernardus 12 is for me, and the alcohol plays more of a role in the taste than the nose, for better or worse. It's a bit hot and abrasive, and although it hurts the drinkability a bit, it serves as a stern warning. Finish is long and full of sweetness, alcohol, and fruit.
M - Mouthfeel is moderately heavy with medium carbonation. Leaves a thick, sweet coating on the palate.
D - Drinkability is moderate. The flavors are interesting but honestly, I am not sure how this compares to Westvleteren 12. I haven't had them side by side so it's hard to be objective, but I found this to be more sweet and alcoholic, and the buttery notes I've gotten in both the Rochefort 8 and 10 are just not doing it for me. It's still a tasty brew, but currently I'd have to give the big three Quads a ranking of... 1. Westvleteren 12, 2. St. Bernardus 12, 3. Rochefort 10. Depending on when I want to crack another Westvleteren, I should definitely do a side by side of all prominent Quads. 2,220 charactersnhindian, Mar 06, 2011
4/5  rDev -10.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Appearance:
Rich dark mahogany brown with a thin, light tan head. Ample carbonation coming up in rippling plumes from the bottom, definitely a beer eager to be conno-sumed. The head didn't last for a very long time, but a gentle swirl brings it back from the dead. Moderate lacing it also present.
I believe I did see some yeast sediment at the bottom of my glass, hard to spot given the beer's light-consuming darkness.
Smell:
A potent liquor head that beams through the beer's natural sweetness. The yeast also provides additional fruitiness that competes for attention, but isn't able to get out of the beer's %ABV shadow. Nothing special jumps out in the nose of this beer to separate it from the other Belgian trappiste quads, great beer smell, should follow through nicely
Taste:
Delightfully rich and bready with a dirty mineral heaviness. A biting fizz mixed with penetrating alcohol and leaves my mouth feeling dry, yet also coated in the beer's syrupy sweetness. This is a fairly mild quad with most of the flavors in harmony, neither the hops nor the yeast seem to stick out more than one another.
Mouthfeel:
For the beer's potency, the alcohol is masked well. The beverage is full bodied and has a semi-sweet dryness that makes is suitable for sipping or pairing with a meal. The beer's bready richness makes each sip filling and adequate.
Drinkability:
A delicious beer that would pair well with a stew or is fine sippings on its own. A strong %ABV makes this beer adequate in it's &lt; 12floz bottle size (let down), but i wouldn't mind trying it in a corked 750ml. This quad is slightly overpriced (unit value), but sometimes it's nice to pay less than a typical $12 for a smaller sampling. In light of a recent fire (where nobody was hurt and no beer was lost), I pray for prices to remain reasonable because I would like to try the other styles produced by these monks!

4.16/5  rDev -6.9%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4A: The beer was a dark brown color highlighted with blood red. There was a smooth tan head on top that lasted for a while.
S: I mainly smelled a sweet dried fruit aroma. Not surprisingly, there was also the presence of the strong alcohol content.
T: Like the smell, I tasted dried fruit and alcohol. While similar to Rochefort 6 and 8, this beer was slightly sweeter than the former two. I could also taste the roasted flavor of the malts.
M: Rochefort 10 was very thick because of the high ABV, but as a whole it felt smooth and had a good mouthfeel as expected.
D: The beer had a good overall flavor, and the alcohol, while strong, was blended well with the other flavors. However, since the alcohol had such a prominent position, I think Rochefort 8 was a little easier to drink than Rochefort 10. I enjoyed all of the Rochefort beers and would rank this one second compared to their other two brews (8 would be first and 6 would be third). 947 charactershumuluslupulus8, Mar 05, 2011
4.7/5  rDev +5.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a very sticky mahogany with a creamy tan head. Big, sweet malt with dark fruits in the nose. The taste is very complex. Butterscotch, sweet malt, dark fruits, a peppery and alcohol bite in the very dry finish. It's huge, smooth, and incredibly complex. I do get some of the 11.3% ABV, but not as much as expected.
The first time I had this, it was cloyingly sweet. It's still rather sweet this time, but not nearly as intrusive.
This is not a beer to chug, it's one to savor and try to figure out.
I don't know if I'd go with "best beer ever", but it's quite good and undeniably unique. A must try. 607 charactersMcNealc31, Mar 05, 2011

Enjoyed as part of my birthday celebration
Appearance - The beer pours a black/brown colour with a very large frothy light brown coloured head. I can't see much carbonation due the darkness of the beer and there is some faint lacing on the sides of the glass. The head lasted for over 5 minutes before it began to dissipate.
Smell - malts, dates, an earthiness, molasses, a smokiness
Taste & Mouth - The beer has an average amount of carbonation and it comes across as slightly creamy on the tongue. I can taste lots of malts, dark fruits (dates?), and molasses. I can also pick up on notes of chocolate and a smokiness/earthiness. It finishes with a dark fruit malty after taste and leaves a but of a warming feeling in my chest.
Drink - The alcohol was extremely well hidden and you'd never know it was a 11% beer. The Drinkability is amazing and it makes the perfect winter warmer/sipper beer. 913 charactersspinrsx, Mar 04, 2011

Nose is pungent, earthy and sweet, hard to place, almost cheese?
This is *chewy*, powerful peaty and sweet malt body with plenty of raisin and super-sweet dark fruit overtones. Not a weak beer, not for the faint of heart. It would be hard to one-up this in terms of flavor.
Mouthfeel is quite nice; enough fizz to keep it from being syrup.
Very tasty, but too rich (and correspondingly expensive and high ABV) to keep drinking all night. 541 characterszaphodchak, Mar 03, 2011

Well, after hearing over and over again that this bad boy is about as close as I'm going to get to the infamous and extremely elusive (which I have yet to find by the way), Trappist Westvleteren 12, I had to pick up a couple of bottles and check it out. I've been drinking the BSDA Trappistes Rocherfort 8 for years and I've always enjoyed it, but this year I've been really making my way through the big QUADS and I'm loving this end of the beer spectrum! Since I can't get my hands on the Westy 12, I'm gonna have to see what this guy is all about. It's been in my fridge for about 3 months and I'm finally getting around to it, here's my review...
Presentation:
A 330ml bottle with a freshness date of 07/2014, they are generally bottled 5 years before the freshness date which makes this bottle almost 2 years old. Again, my fridge hangs out at about 37 degrees so I had to let this sit for a good 15 minutes before popping the cap off. This review took place on 03/01/2011.
Appearance:
An excitedly aggressive pour into a Corsendonk Tulip. It comes out rusty then settles completely pitch black. Four fingers of bubbles right off the bat with web-like lacing as it sat down into an almost flapjack thick and cream soda head that looked delicious!
Smell:
Alcohol, seriously, it's not kidding... followed by that burned sugar smell like an over flambéed crème brulee, sweet.
Mouthfeel:
Prickly alcohol. Again, it's up front about its strength then a tingle from the carbonation that suits the full and very thick body. A little sour aftertaste that doesn't stick around very long but adds a ton to the complexity and made me actually take a few more tastes to see if I could identify the exact characteristics of what I was tasting on the back end.
Drinkability:
Definitely a sip and savour, it's not something that I'm gonna be slammin' all night. I think one bottle a session and a slow drink with this one to really figure out what's going on is the right approach. At 11.3% it's not a joke and it doesn't pretend to be. This one stands up tall and proud.
Taste:
It's got some serious warming from the alcohol, I think I've mentioned that a couple of times already. The first thing that I taste right after the sting is licorice immediately followed by a peppery spice then a sugary truffle well and hints of figs and nutmeg. Hops are invisible; it's definitely got a malty spine and that dark fruitiness that you expect in a world class Quad. For the complexity, taste and overall experience, I score this one high but it fails on drinkability for me so I can't give it an A, it's a B+ IMHO. However, if this is any indication of how the Trappist Westvleteren 12 is going to be, I can't wait to get my hands on a bottle. If any of you know where I can get ahold of the Unicorn they call the Westy 12, by all means, send one my way! 3,036 charactersjayavery, Mar 02, 2011
4.21/5  rDev -5.8%look: 3 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.5Pours a very hazy amber-brown body with little kakhi head.
Smells of plums, candied sugar and molases. Hints of caramel and some sweet apple ring out.
Taste is full of dark fruits. Slight cherry, plum, raison and dates fill the palate and some nice crystal malt based caramel come through at the end. 
Its mouthfeel is smooth and silky but still a little abrasive. 364 characterschaz410, Mar 01, 2011
4.5/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Believe it or not, I hadn't yet treated myself to the highly acclaimed Rochefort 10 until this tasting. Trappist ales have always been a thing of mystery to me and it boggles my mind to think of these humbled, self-sacrificing, brown-robed monks roaming around their monasteries brewing (and drinking) such Heavenly creations between chants & Bible versus. 
I was happy to pour this dark liquid into my secular Duval glass and watch proteins expand and form a web-like lacing along its upper-mid curvature. The nose enticed me through a mystic, damp European forest of aroma; i imagined myself a furry little boar, snout-deep in a burrowed truffle well.
A world of dark, dried and rehydrated fruits, plump, sweetened and condensed greeted my already-salivating mouth. Bursts of soft carbonation massaged my tongue like a relaxing whirlpool after a long day in that cold damp forest. Complex and refined as only a life of contemplation and meditation can create.
I now understand the difference between a secular & Trappist ale; only with a Trappist can you say, "Holy Sh*t, I'm getting drunk!" and literally mean it. Whether or not you are a Believer, you can definitely appreciate this as the work of "god". 1,211 charactersburnheartsMKE, Mar 01, 2011

A: Pours a beautiful oil slick brown, pretty milky with sediment, but I like to agitate the sediment in the bottom of the bottle when I pour my beers
S: Intense notes of fennel on the nose with subtle brown sugar, cirtus and coton candy coming through as well
T: On the palate I get a lot more licorice and banana than I remember, perhaps from the bottle aging? Also notes of toffe, cloves, and dark fruits
M: Has kind of thinned out after 3 years, but still a dynamic mouthfeel with a nice medium carbonation
D: Quite drinkable at 11.3% ABV, a more pronounced herbaceousness than I was expecting, especially compared to the 3 year old Westy 12 I tried it next to. I think it's arguably more complex than the Westy, a beer I think it's deservedly compared to, and while I'd put it in my top 5 quads I've had, I think the Westy still wins out. 948 charactersnbree00, Mar 01, 2011
4.47/5  rDev 0%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a deep coffee color, opaque and a bit cloudy, and much darker than I expected, with amber at the edges and a 1-finger tan head that quickly dissipates leaving no lacing.
Smell is that lovely sweet malty yeasty odor all good Belgian trappist ales have. In this case it's well-rounded and very pleasing, with just a hint of the high alcohol this brew contains. Strong dark fruits, figs... yum.
Taste is rich and sweet, very malt-forward. So much more going on there, though. It's a bit like a sweet fruity bread. Rich, heavy, and a lot of flavors playing around. Dark fruity malts predominate. But there are a lot of subtle flavors that round it out really well. The only issue for me is that it's just a bit too sweet.
Mouthfeel is medium-heavy, rather chewy, with enough stickiness to linger in the mouth. Nice carbonation - not too little, not too much.
This is quite simply a fantastic, delicious, decadent beer. Very complex, with a great malt backbone. The alcohol is nearly invisible, except for a touch in the nose. I could drink it all night, if I didn't start feeling tipsy halfway through my glass. 1,117 characterszeledonia, Feb 28, 2011

This may be my favorite beer on planet earth.
Poured a very hazy brown. Decent head at first that went away after a few minutes. Strong lacing on this one.
Strong fruit notes on this one. More dark fruits like figs, plums and raisins. Very sweet and bready aroma. Then behind it all there is a faint smell of alcohol.
The taste is very similar to the nose. Strong dark fruit taste with perfect carbonation. A perfect combination of fruityness and alcohol.
The mouthfeel is smooth and slightly chewy. Very nice carbonation, low enough to really take in all the flavors of this complex beer.
Very drinkable and world class. 656 charactersdnolan36, Feb 28, 2011
4.78/5  rDev +6.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Poured from the bottle into a tulip.
This may be the most perfectly poured beer I have ever seen. It pours a dark chesnut borwn. The lacing on the glass is the best I have ever seen in a beer. I am not sure the age of this one since I have had it before and not seen it this good, but the one in this bottle is too perfect. Small bubbles lace every part of the glass and it looks just amazing. 
The smell is of burnt sugar which I love and a little bit of light fruit. The taste is of dark fruit and more sugar and light spices like nutmeg. It ends with a creamy finish. While this may not seem like a 5 description, they are done so perfectly and blended so amazing, I can almost not even explain it. The mouthfeel is very good with more of a creamy nutty finish. This beer tastes no where near 11.3%. I could of drank this extremely fast and could of drank another just as fast afterwards if I wanted to. By far the most drinkable beer I have ever had and if I could give it a 10 for drinkability I would. It deserves the hype. 1,031 charactersmcgwire756, Feb 28, 2011

A-Dark brown with muddy particles of yeast and a light mocha head.
S=Thin candi sugar sweetness, cotton candy, circus peanuts, licorice, marzipan.
T/M-At 3 years old, this is drinking great. Very thin and refined with light prickly carbonation. Banana, clove and black licorice are right up front, yielding to slick, yeasty tropical fruit flavors and brown sugar in the finish.
D-Best Belgian quad. Drank this side by side with a 3 year Westy 12 and ROchefort came out on top. 499 charactersDaveHS, Feb 27, 2011
4.64/5  rDev +3.8%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Legendary. In the same vein as St. Bernardus Abt 12. Dark brown look probably less head than St. B 12, but is perhaps a bit more drinkable because of a softer carbonation for such a high abv beer. This is a bit different than St. B 12 in that it smells a tad bit more like fruit than fine sherry (St. B). The taste is less fruity, but as I mentioned more drinkable and dare I say I prefer this beer a bit more because of it. You have to drink this slow. The alcohol is nearly non-apparent, barely even warming. Save this one for the pope, because "beer is living proof that god loves us and wants us to be happy!" - B.F. 620 charactersOttoPeeWee, Feb 27, 2011
4.72/5  rDev +5.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to my brother for this kind Birthday gift!
Rochefort 10 appears slightly different out of the bottle than I was expecting. It is kind of a muddy river water dark brown, with deep mahogany and almost greenish hues when held close to light. The head is uniformly dense and dark beige, with tightly packed little bubbles scattered throughout. This head rose to about a finger and a half from a medium pour into my 23 oz. snifter. I cannot see through the body of the beast. Lacing left on the glass is dense and full of arches. 
My first thought about the smell (other than a bit of confusion), was that it reminds me of my grandmother's mince meat pie. After a Google search of the ingredients of said pie, this made perfect sense. Certainly, I can smell fig, raisin, plum, and dark cherry, and these dark fruit aromas are supported by spicy smells of cinnamon, clove, and nutmeg. There is also a little bit of a peppery quality to the aroma, as well as toasty notes. Mainly I am impressed how these fruit and spice qualities meld seamlessly with a phenolic odor. It really is a very pointed and cogent smell that needs to be picked apart a bit to find individual characteristics. A fairly heavy alcoholic heat is also an important quality found in the smell, but it is not overpowering at all and adds to the quality of the bouquet. As the beer warms, the fruit and spice flavors emerge and the phenolic character takes a secondary position. Caramelized and brown sugar smells also come out as the beer comes closer to room temperature. Wow, this is a complex and heavy (think Marty McFly) combination of malt and Belgian yeast. 
The flavor immediately break forth onto my palate with an earthy, yeasty, peppery flavor combination that transitions more toward dark fruits and sweet spices as it spends more time in my mouth. This reminds me a lot of a fine liquor... almost like the best rum ever made, but without the stinging alcoholic heat- only a lovely, warming contribution from the alcohol. Notes of caramelized brown sugar are a huge component of the taste and really play well off of the dark fruit flavors. The phenolic quality that I ascertain from the smell is fairly hidden in the flavor, and its place as a role player pushes the overall taste over the top. The finish is really quite sweet and brings the dark fruits, namely fig and raisin, to the forefront. However, more sips reveal that the finish is really a combination of the sweet dark fruits and spices and the reappearance of the the earthy, peppery yeast influence. This taste is extremely nuanced and has more components than I can possibly describe, so I will stop this long-winded rant now. 
The mouthfeel is a journey through the nuance of this beer. It starts with a very forward earthy/spicy/semi-sweetness on the tip of my tongue, then disperses like an ocean wave over the rest of my palate as the thick sweetness of the malts kick in. The finish is slightly drying, yet the overpowering sweetness of the middle of the sip mingles with the earthy and peppery characteristics to provide an aftertaste that lingers until the next sip. 
This is one amazing beer. The care and craftsmanship that must have gone into this recipe over time boggles my mind. There are so many subtleties that complement one another in a symbiotic manner. All that said, yes, I want this again, but it is not something that I could or would want to drink regularly. I think my brain would explode if I did. Lovely beer. 3,488 charactersTCHopCraver, Feb 26, 2011

A -Pours a Mahogany colour with a chocolate like appearance. The head is Ivory in colour and hangs around and laces the whole way down.
S - Wow, Aromas of dark fruit, raisins, figs and yeast and all powerful. I rate this.
T - Abundant flavours of prunes dark fruits a little liquorice and dark chocolate as well as vanilla. The end is so perfect and lingers with well balanced malty booze. This is a 5
M - So unbelievably smooth. Medium body and carbonation.
D - Quads are my favourite style of beer and this beer demonstrates why I love Belgian beers above all others. 607 characterseric5bellies, Feb 26, 2011

A: Pours a light tan head that holds well and has a island of darker froth on the top. The body is a murky beer bottle brown, with suspended sediment. Lacing settles slowly, but slides down the glass.
S: A deep and roasted note, not overly boozy in the aroma at all. Good goes at fig and plum, a deep fruit plate. Medium intensity aroma, with a nice presence.
T/M: A welcome to the warm gathering that is roasted, malted heaven. Cream and warmth come from the sweetness of this beer. Mouthfeel is very smooth. Yeast plays a dominate role in the flavor profiles of this beer, but as do the candied sugars. Finish is long and releases a nice floral numbing. 
D:This is one for the savoring, while being almost light on the palate for the abv and the style. 801 charactersGDBEERMAN, Feb 26, 2011
4.75/5  rDev +6.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5A: Poured into a Duvel tulip glass. A brownish hazy color...pretty much the standard iced-tea look of a Quad. A mild head that receded quickly (high alcohol) and left a token cap. High carbonation is evident and keeps rising from the bottom of the glass.
S: Ahhhh! All that I expected and more. Those delicious dark fruit notes of fig, date, raisin, plum, dark cherry are all there. In addition...a tad of funkiness from the yeast strain. Maybe just a tad phenolic as well.
T: First sip was taken too cold and all I got was the carbonation delivered alcohol. A few swirls and some warming revealed what was hidden below...something World Class. This one hits it out of the park as a Quad. Very much similar to my highly favored St Bernardus Abt 12. This also had a little something unique on the back side...for twangy funkiness that is hard to describe...but good! All the dark fruits come through. Delicious figs, dates, raisin, prunes, dark cherry, slight strawberry, and a touch of molasses and vanilla perhaps. Sweet malt. The whole package is there. Excellent lingering malt sweetness on the palate. Perfectly balanced.
M: Medium body. Amazingly smooth. Creamy rich. A fresh head with each swirl. A pleasure to drink.
D: I could drink this every day. I had this one before lunch and with no breakfast. Awesome...and you finally get the well hidden (11.3%) alcohol at the end....it does sneak up as this is soooo smooth.
O: Outstanding. I fully understand why so many rate this beer as highly as they do. Definitely an epic drink. In my top 2 Quads and certainly in my top 5-10 beers across all styles...Period!!! 1,623 charactersBrunite, Feb 25, 2011
4.6/5  rDev +2.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Bottled May 26, 2010.
Pours a very deep, dark brown with almost no head. That may be due to a fairly slow pour. 
For me, the smell is similar (though certainly not identical) to the Rochefort 8, but not as strong. Sweet malts, somewhat fruity. 
The taste, however, is very noticeably different than the 8. Plum and cherry, quite sweet, and toffee, quickly followed by a fairly powerful alcohol taste. Reminds me of a nice dark rum, in fact, but obviously not as strong. Personally, I think the alcohol taste is lovely. There is a lot going on in this beer. I suppose I could try and identify a bunch of different flavours, but I will simply say that it is tastes incredible. Just a wonderful, wonderful beer. 
Mouthfeel is also excellent. Wonderfully full-bodied, and just the right amount of carbonation- you notice it jumping around a bit in your mouth, but only slightly. 
Drinkability is hard to say. It tastes and feels wonderful, so in a sense it is incredibly drinkable. However, it is a very strong beer, and is certainly a sipper. You wouldn't want it to go quickly anyway. 1,087 charactersjrenihan, Feb 25, 2011
3.83/5  rDev -14.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3The biggest of the legendary Rocheforts weighs in at over 11% ABV, so it's no small beer.
Doesn't look like a small beer, either. Pours clean (in my case into a tulip glass) with minimal head on a medium pour. It's a deep, murky brown with hints of red at the edges but otherwise totally opaque.
The aroma is overtly boozy similar to a big barleywine style ale. If you pay close attention you get some hints of figs and caramelized apples, but the big, malty alcohol smell dominates. It's certainly a STRONG aroma. Whether or not it's a *good* aroma depends on your tastes. Lovers of giant IPAs, for instance, won't see the appeal. Easy to see opinions will vary wildly on this one.
However, as it warms, the aroma mellows a bit, revealing wafts of malt and raisin. Much more pleasant closer to room temperature.
Once you start tasting the alcohol is less noticeable, though it's still very much present. Here you start to get a nutty caramel and pumpernickel and other Earthy brown breads. The taste starts mild, then expands GREATLY into a yeasty burst of pleasingly musty flavors before finishing with an alcohol-laden shimmer of mildly sweet breads and dried fruits.
Feels like the other Rocheforts on the mouth, which is to say pleasantly carbonated and very full-bodied; nary a hint of wateriness and rich with a very tangible feel on the tongue.
If the 10 falters anywhere it's that it demands a different approach than most beers - and that may throw folks off. This should be sipped. Not just because it's potent, but because it drinks best that way. The 6 and 8 are both highly drinkable, but the 10 casts an imposing, alcohol-heavy shadow on them. Many American crafts manage to meet or even exceed this ABV without the alcohol coming to the fore. Not here. Here it wants to arm wrestle you. American craft lovers have been spoiled with easy-to-drink big beers; the Belgians aren't playing that game. This is not for the faint of heart.
I suspect the 10 probably ages WONDERFULLY and would be far more drinkable in a year's time, but at less than six months old this one is relatively young and feisty.
Still, a quite excellent beer that will only get better with time. I look forward to trying cellared bottles a year and two years from now. 2,261 charactersShoegaze99, Feb 25, 2011

Appearance: Finger sized head on top of a dark brew. It looks a bit dirty.

Taste: Very sweet flavor that is cut by the alcohol. Alcohol flavor warms at the end with a lingering tart flavor. Crushed berries, chocolate, honey... nice mix of flavors.
Not too bad. Needs.... to be less expensive. That would make this brew a bit more drinkable. One or two is worth the price, though. It's also a tad too sweet. 512 characterswmtxbb, Feb 24, 2011

Pours a deep brown color. Surprisingly small head on this one, though I poured extra carefully because I had problems with yeast sediment in the last 8 I had.
Aromas of raspberries, dark fruits, toffee, and chocolate. A hint of alcohol in the nose. Somewhat similar to a big red wine in the nose. Probably the best smelling beer I've had thus far.
Taste very much mirrors the smell, especially up front. Doesn't remind me of wine as much in the taste. I think the raspberry and chocolate flavors are reduced compared to the nose.
Excellent mouthfeel. Not too syrupy, and a light but complementary amount of carbonation.
A slow sipper, but more because I want to drink it slowly than because I have to. Probably my favorite beer at the moment. 830 charactersslowbie, Feb 24, 2011

Exquisite dark candied fruit flavors abound with notes of brown sugar and molasses, spicey clove, grapes, prunes/raisins and more in an extremely well balanced bouquet of flavor that obviously is time tested and quality tested.

S: I honestly smell a bit of a red wine in this one. Very sweet, a bit of Belgian yeast and alcohol. Also some dark fruits, plums specifically.
T: Sweet up front on the taste, gives way to a powerful hit of dark fruits. Slight Belgian yeasts and a hint of alcohol at the end. Truly one of the best tasting beers I've ever had.
MF: Light to medium, with a tinge of carbonation. Alcohol is left on the palate.

S: Buttery, nutty and smoky on the nose. 
T: Rich and flavorful with a cheese-like quality. Esters are noticeable yet are subtle enough to leach off the tongue with the gentle coaxing of the hops. Fades slowly to almost no aftertaste. Very slightly sweet from the hops with burnt sugar smokiness.

D: Very nice and really should be enjoyed with breads, cheeses or a hearty meal. 760 charactersAiptasia, Feb 22, 2011

Nose is surprisingly underwhelming (in comparison to every other aspect of this fine beer), with bits of banana, bread, and cherries.
Mouth is so complex it's almost overwhelming. Cherries mixed with a doughy cakiness. This is more like a pastry than a beer. Beautifully balanced, I also get hints of a bubble gum flavor. There is a liquor flavor that gives away the high alcohol content.
This is fruity and full. Highly, highly recommended. 532 charactersrinhaak, Feb 21, 2011
4.62/5  rDev +3.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Cloudy dark brown and thin tan head with good retention and spotty lacing. Figs and sugary yeast and touches of floral. Malty alcohol tempered with raisin and fig with strong clear flavor with caramel sweetness. Chocolate and cherry flavors make an appearance after awhile. Slightly fuzzy and silky mouthfeel.
What is there to say but this is an exceptional beer. Aroma isn't what I would consider complex but it is so good it only whet's your appetite for what's to come. It is very sweet (I like that), like a liquid candy bar (in a good way) but it's somehow balanced or tempered by the yeast and alcohol. The alcohol accentuates the taste rather than just creating a pleasant warming or boozy quality. It certainly has similarities to malt liquor but it seems every sip brings something new. My only complaint is the bottle isn't big enough! 846 charactersBriken, Feb 21, 2011

A- Dark brown and murky. Slighly reddish where the light can poke through. Light whitish tan head that fades off quickly.
S- Sweet. Caramel, dark fruit, raisins, dates, and plums. A nice touch of belgian yeast. 
T- Very similar to the smell, a sweet malty belgian. Tastes primarily of raisins and dates, with touches of molassas.
M- Thick and quite syrupy, but there is a nice carbonation to it. Smooth finish, and just great flavor all around.
D- Very easy to slug back, but the ABV started hitting me quickly. The booziness becomes pretty evident after it warms a bit. One of the best belgians you can buy in the US in my opinion. 689 charactersGfunk720, Feb 20, 2011

Very pleasant "discovery" and rightfully so voted as one of the top beers around the world. 
Heavy, solid, black-brown trappist with plenty of candy sugars and accordingly sweet (though definitely not overdone), a hint of something roasted or bitter "fondant" chocolate and a very long-lasting aftertaste, though one would only wish it stayed forever. 
This one easily waltzed itself into my personal list of favourites and once again it's only confirmed by thousands of other beer enthusiasts around the world. 545 charactersNoctilucus, Feb 20, 2011

4.5/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I went out to find this beer specifically. A little shocked to find it at 7.49 a bottle (11.2 oz). My first dive into the top 10 in the world. haha.
A &gt; Nice dark color with a very nice tanish head, about 1 finger. 
S &gt; Very fragrant with a good old fashioned beer smell to it. nothing bad about it.
T &gt; Very nice flavor, there were some sweet coffee notes, with some almost chocolate like burnt caramel notes. Sweet in overall taste. 
M &gt; Nice cling but not too much. Light alchol sting near the end, but very good. 
D &gt; Would only want 1 or 2 of these but would enjoy every minute of it. 
Very happy with this tasting!! 642 charactersderekmorris7, Feb 20, 2011

A: very dark with a beautiful creamy head.
S: This is probably the best smelling beer I have ever had. It smells better than most of my favorite wines.
T: This is the best tasting beer I have ever had. period. I am new to the BA and craft beer world, so I don't have a lot of experience, but it is glorious. nicely balance sweet and malty with a well-masked alcohol.
M: A beer that you don't want to swallow right away. feels smooth.
D: Very solid drinkability for it's high alcohol. definitly a sipper and not a session beer by any means, but very good. 610 charactersjaymesbawned, Feb 18, 2011

The scent is of sweet sugars, licorice, notes of cocoa.
The taste is of sweet sugars, dark fruit, bread, spicy pepper, bold malts, licorice, notable alcohol presence.
Medium bodied, smooth and creamy, moderate carbonation.
This was a very tasty beer, there is so much flavor it is difficult to experience it all in just one beer. I will definitely look for this again. 481 charactersBeerCon5, Feb 18, 2011
4.68/5  rDev +4.7%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Someone told me that this is the type of beer you need to sip slowly to enjoy, but you will want to gulp it down. Boy was he right. It poured a very very dark brown with a light 1 finger head. The smell as a bit fruitier than I was expecting. When you sip it, you notice immediately that it coats your entire mouth, but it is not heavy at all. I know others have commented on the alcohol bite, but I did not notice it at all -- something quite exceptional for a beer with this ABV. The taste is complex but not overbearing. I do get some dark fruit notes, but everything is balanced exceptionally well. It has a short finish but it is satisfying. I was surprised at complex this was without hitting you in the face. In a word: subtle. It scores a perfect 100 when it comes to drinkability. I can't imagine anything this wouldn't compliment and I couldn't imagine a time of day (or night) when I wouldn't enjoy one of these. Top notch. 934 characterskickert, Feb 18, 2011
4.63/5  rDev +3.6%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 512oz bottle from Abe's of Bethlehem, PA. Poured carefully into a St. Bernardus chalice.
A- Perfect opaque dark leather color. Fine creamy head. A healthy layer of yeast resides in my bottle where it belongs. Head fades to a thin layer leaving nice lacing.
S- Complex dark fruit and chocolate flavor.
T- Complex plum, melon, raison, grape, fig flavors. Kind of reminds me of a fine chocolate fruit cake? lol. Very unique and distinguishable.
M- Very nice carbonation and taste profile lends to a very nice mouthfeel. To earn a 5.0 it would require just a little bit heavier mouthfeel.
D- This is a fine sipper and truly a world class beverage. 647 charactersTheSupremeAJ, Feb 18, 2011
4.92/5  rDev +10.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Crap this is good beer. One finger head of medium brown hue. Thick lace, with little cling. Color is a 33 on the SRM beer color chart. Smells of melon, raisins, plum, peach, molasses, grapes. Flavor is one of the best I have sampled. Figs, plum, peach, pear, melon, molasses, caramel, chocolate. The more I taste the more flavors I find. Rich and creamy in my mouth. I would like to drink this all day, but with the price and the ABV or almost 12 percent, I don't think this will happen. This is a really good beer. 515 charactersbeerprovedwright, Feb 17, 2011
4.28/5  rDev -4.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Poured from 11oz bottle. 
A- Pours a dark brown color. One anda half finger tan head shows great retention. Web style lacing left on the sides of the glass. 
S- Tons of sweet caramel malts with large hints of candy sugar toward the front of the aroma. Darker fruits (mostly raisins) dominate right after the initial hints from the front. Nice belgian yeast also comes into play toward the end. Alcohol notes in the ending come into play just for a short second. 
T- Toasted toffee malts in the front of the beer. Brown sugar is a big flavor right after the toasted malts. Darker fruits in the beer shine toward the middle with black cherries, prunes, raisins, and anise. Spicey belgian yeast in the background of the later half of the beer itself. Alcohol comes through the ending of the beer as well with light medicinal tones. 
M- Medium mouthfeel. Carbonation was good for the style. Toffee malts with darker fruits left on the palate. Aftetaste is mostly sweet alcohol, darker fruits, and belgian yeasts. This beer is balanced almost perfect. No real off flavors were present. Medium alcohol drying on the palate.
D- This beer is a fantastic example of the style. The ABV doesn't really seem to be there in aroma and taste. I would recommend this beer to anyone who wants a good trappist beer without paying an arm and a leg for another one that you can't get in the states ;) 1,385 charactersalleykatking, Feb 17, 2011
4.88/5  rDev +9.2%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Pours a black w/ a perfect off white 2 finger head. It looks perfect in my Chimay glass, thus the rare 5 on appearance. The smell is fantastic- dates, walnuts, malt, spice, very complex smell. I wish I didn't have a cold right now, because I'm having a hard time picking up all the smells- still great though. The taste: One word comes to mind when I take my first sip- "WOW!" I don't know where to begin. Caramel, dates, raisin, malt, and alcohol hit the taste buds. Each mouthfeel is like eating a loaf of bread- but still smooth. Slight burn w/ the alcohol aftertaste. What a great beer. At 11.3%, it's a sipper, and you wouldn't want more than one in a sitting. World class all the way. This is definitely one of my favorite quads, and one of my favorite beers period. 772 charactersjayhawk73, Feb 16, 2011
4.84/5  rDev +8.3%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Pours black with a large beautiful off-white head. Special care must be taken to stand this one up for awhile before enjoying, and when it's poured unless you want to chew it you need to keep a close eye on the neck of the bottle and pull back when you see that healthy sediment start to slide down. Unique and wonderful smell of malt and banana. Flavor is fantastic, a malty plum-like flavor that is dry and yeasty. Soft mouthfeel despite the healthy carbonation. Goes down nice, with flavor to the end. Finishes dry and complete. An outstanding beer that I personally enjoy with some nice aged gouda. 602 charactersWegomlegging, Feb 14, 2011

S-Smells of dark plum with some alcohol and brown sugar on the finish.
T-Reminds me of Samichlaus at first with dark fruits and has some noticeable alcohol and finishes with a slightly bitter and mildly hot alcohol finish.
M-Mouth-coating and rich without being full-bodied, but closer to light side of medium bodied with a warming mouth- and throat feel.
D-Pretty easy drinking for high of an ABV this one is. I couldn't see having more than a small bottle of it due to the richness of it though. 575 characterssamie85, Feb 14, 2011
3.91/5  rDev -12.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Pours very dark unfiltered brown. very little light passes through except at the edges. Smallish light brown head.
Smell comes through with lots of sweet malt.
Taste again has lots of malt and sweet. I get some subtle licorice hints and overall quite alcoholic although I would say not at its 11.3% level.
Mouth is a bit thick with a lot of alcohol. decent carbonation.
Drinkability was only OK for me. I know quad Belgians are not my favorite but I was expecting a bit more from this beer. It was OK but I will not go out of my way to have it again. Nothing really stood out to me as exceptional. 601 charactersmryuk, Feb 13, 2011

A: Dark caramel with a thin white head that sticks around for a while.
S: Caramel, rock candy, cloves, figs...Ok, its pretty damned complex, everytime you give it a smell, it seem like its changed on you.
T: Taste is truly remarkable. Dark fruits and yeast funkiness come first, but musty hops, caramel sweetness and cognac twang finish.
D: Drinkability is ridiculously high. It isn't hot or unbalanced in the least. It has a tight, prickly carbonation that is almost perfect.
Overall: An incredible beer. So much complexity and depth. This is truly a world class brew. Recommended! 639 charactersJohnnyChicago, Feb 12, 2011

Smell: Noticeable alcohol smell here. Behind it are plums and grapes/raisins and other fruits.
Taste: Again, noticeable alcohol. More plums and raisins, with some other fruit. Has a finish that reminds me of dark rum, strange, but not unpleasant.
Mouthfeel: Nice and thick. Crisp carbonation, but feels a little bit different from other Belgians, was hoping for that perfect Belgian carbonation I've seen other places.
Drinkability: One and done. Its all from the upfront alcohol taste and smell. It does not invite you to drink more. And its a sipper.
Overall: I'm honestly disappointed. For a top 10 beer, I expected more, especially a top ranked Belgian. I was most surprised by the strong alcohol smell and taste, most good beers of this abv hide that. Now, my only other quad experience is Ommegang Three Philosophers, so I'm not a quad expert. I might get another bottle to age and see if that improves it. My guess from the date stamped on the label is that this was bottled 4/14/10, so it would be 10 months old, so it might need more time on top of that. I'm also curious about how other reviews either highlight the alcohol presence, or talk about this wonderful, complex, amazing beer. Will update if I get another one. 1,332 charactersMadCat, Feb 11, 2011

4.3/5  rDev -3.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4A- The traditional pour creates a work of art. This starts off wonderful. Fluffy and creamy all at once. The center is extremely carbonated while the edges have that shaving cream pharmaceutical grade elegance you need. Not sticky enough to have a full blown lacing, but a minor amount pleases me. The extremely dark brown body does reveal the microscopic cascades of carbonation up the sides of my snifter.
S- Nicely alcoholic with some dark fruits and cream. Something sweet and custard like to it. Smells of plums, dates, raisins, and simple syrup. Definitely has that ethanolic characteristic on the outflow that is sharp, but not painful.
T- First impressions are a hit of alcohol with big sweetness. Tons of malt body with molasses coming out strong. Some dark fruits following that are mostly of the raisin type. Ethanol dipped bread. Biscuit but... interesting bread. Like a toasted wheat. Finish is ethanolic with a minor bitter nature. Some hints of biscuit as well.
M-Mild bodied, creamy, crisp, bubbly. Nice lingering burn from the alcohol that is more tingly than anything else. Flavors don't really stick around anywhere.
D- I really enjoy this beer. It has amazing flavors and aromas. It feels a bit lacking, and for something this alcoholic it drinks incredibly easy. I'd love to do this one again. Very good example of the style. 1,350 charactersKhazadum, Feb 04, 2011

4.85/5  rDev +8.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Bottled in June '09. Split a bottle with my brother (Zodijackyl)
Pours dark with a thin and lacy head. Presents itself well in a short goblet.
Aroma begins with a full-bodied yeasty smell. It also presents an aroma of rich caramelized grains after smelling it for a few seconds, demonstrating the complexity of the brew. Hints of nuts and a touch of fruit underscore the smell.
As I take my first sip, I taste a subtle and not unpleasant tinge of ethanol on the front. That alcoholic taste quickly fades to a subtle wave of nutty, almost earthy, mildly metallic (but not in a bad way) taste that fades over the back of the tongue to a pleasant, purely nutty taste as the overtones fade.
Mouthfeel of a world-class beer. The flavors don't all present immediately but don't linger, and inspire you to hold a mouthful as long as you continue to find new subtleties within the taste. 882 charactersIanH84, Feb 03, 2011
4.37/5  rDev -2.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Finally I decided to take this out of my stash and try my first Rochefort!
11.2oz bottle poured into a Rochefort chalice
A: Pours dark brown, opaque, very thin head that quickly dissipates. 
S: Dark fruits (plums, raisins, maybe dates and figs), slight prune, molasses, alcohol.
T: The dark fruits are there, but are completely enveloped in a huge amount of malty sweetness. Tons of light molasses and brown sugar lend to a massive malty body that almost hides some of the dark fruit. The slight tartness of the plums and raisins just poke in and out of the malt. Alcohol has a nice warming throughout and is slightly peppery and phenol. 
M: Carbonation seems fairly light. The body is medium to full, however the huge depth of malt make it seem massive. It's unbelievably smooth, syrupy, and velvety. At the same time it's damn chewy with seemingly endless layers of malt. 
D: The alcohol is definitely there and can catch up pretty quick, but the tastes and body is too darned good to spend long nursing. 
Overall this is a damned good beer, right there with St. Bernardus Abt 12, though I did enjoy Pannepot Reserva '08 a bit more. 1,141 charactersSatchboogie, Feb 02, 2011
4.4/5  rDev -1.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5A- Impermeable. cloudy. dark brown goodness topped with a 2 finger tan head. The bubbles are extremely fine and head retention is magnificent, leaving globs sticking to the side of the glass.
S- Dark toffee, molasses, apricots. It's only slightly fuming alcohol.
T- Initially cake-like malt smooths in gently, giving way to a torrent of warming alcohol, coffee notes and a barely noticeable whisp of hops playing in the back of the tongue. Fruit esters resembling plum and apricot are secondary to the experience and reside mostly in the last moments of swallowing and the aftertaste. The aftertaste is grainy and dry.
M- Because of the carbonation and general weight of this quad, the mouthfeel is brilliantly smooth, substantial, and rather chewy. I would readily volunteer to fast if this brew was available.
D- I wouldn't have more than one, at very least not in a row. But at 11,2 percent, you wouldn't need much more to satisfy a pensive beer geek such as myself. 973 charactersOchsenblut, Feb 01, 2011

4.5/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Look - This beer pours a very dark brown, almost purple color. It had a solid head. It was hard to see but holding it up to the light you could see some small bubbles going on.
Smell - You got a lot of rich malt character right off. There was some earthiness and dryness in the background. There is some dark fruit, raisin and bread qualities to it.
Taste - Toffee, caramel sweetness and some dryness were right up front. It had a little sweetness and dark fruit that was balanced with the alcohol bite. It finished with a little bit of raisin character to it. 
Feel - There was a very heavy mouth feel, with just a slight amount of carbonation. It had a nice creamy texture to it. 
Drinkability - It was like a fine cognac. You felt the alcohol bite but it was not off putting. 782 charactersbeldin96, Jan 29, 2011
4.52/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a deep, dark brown/ruby color with two fingers of tan head that slowly recede to a thick layer on the surface that lasts as I drink.
Aroma is rich, bready malt, dark fruits such as dates, plums and raisins, spices such as clove and mild coriander, dark caramels, hints of bright fruits, leather, honey and some alcohol.
Taste is very complex, strong yet smooth. Overall it is Port-like, but malty, bready and deeper than that. The deep fig, date and plum flavors dominate with some dark caramels, leather, apricots and spice adding to the complexity. The finish is on the dry side but has a sweet, fruity side to it and a noticeable alcoholic warmth.
Mouthfeel is medium with medium/high carbonation and small bubbles that make it feel smooth.
Overall this beer is incredibly rich, strong and complex, it deserves to be sipped at about 55 degrees after a square meal. I can't say I'll be drinking this often but when I do it will be memorable. 953 characterstrevorjn06, Jan 28, 2011

The aromas are of plum, yeast bread, and ALOT of alcohol. It also has this slightly off, sour tinge to it. Meh. It's very bready and gives off a lot of dark fruits. Of course, a little too much alcohol. This makes me crave a St. Bernardus 12 Abt. It drinks ok, and that's about it. It's still crisp and goes down smoothly but isn't very drinkable. This beer features far too much alcohol. This was infinitely better the first time I had it. This bottle let me down. Rochefort is 0-2 on the evening. 573 charactersaasher, Jan 28, 2011

The taste is on point with the perfect amount of a caramel smooth sweetness with nice amount of carbonation.
The mouthfeel is nice and full and has just the right kick with the high abv and overall this is the perfect beer nice smooth and very drinkable. 434 charactersjbartlett89, Jan 28, 2011
5/5  rDev +11.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Reviewing from notes on 12/25/10: Christmas day battle of the Quads. Paired against Westy 12 and St. Bernardus abt 12. 
Poured into a Duvel Tulip.
This beer is the beer that turned me onto quads and all their glory. 
A: Very VERY dark brown color, almost black, but not quite there. Little light pierces the edges of the beer. Fingers worth of tan head that linger for a few, leaving a master piece of lacing on the edge of the glass. Godly looking beer in a tulip. 
S: Wow, Just wow. This beer really makes you appreciate beer in all of its craftsman ship. Dark fruits dominate as they should. Dates and raisons seem to dominate as well as a carmel-sugaryness. Belgian yeast present. Very complex smell for the good ol' nosey. 
T: Beer sent from god. Dark fruits prevail, as well as some brown sugar/belgian candy sugar i guess you could call it. As one fellow BA said, "like butterscotch poured over roasted raison bread." Just a wonderful tasting beer that makes you not want to take your lips of the edge of your glass. Very complex brew though, might take some warming up to really appreciate the style
M: Perfect levels of carbonation. Mouth feel is excellent and addicting. You just can't keep it out of your mouth (thats what she said!). Also, for 11.30% alcohol, man is it well hidden behind the complexity of the dark fruits and belgian sugars. 
D: This is one well made beer. A very addicting beer that you can't put down. Alcohol can sneak up on you but its just so good you don't care. Once you have one, you will be wanting another.
In the tasting, i tied both Westy 12 and Rochefort 10, but i am putting Rochefort 10 ahead in this review for one huge reason. I can purchase Rochefort 10 at any point during the year about 3 miles away from where i currently live. Just makes this beer even better knowing i don't have to trade/spend ridiculous amounts of money in shipping to get ahold of it. In the top three beers i have ever had. 1,954 charactersCaptainTripps, Jan 27, 2011
4.55/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5poured out of the bottle into a snifter
A: The beer pours a dark mahogany brown with some deep reds showing through in the light. It's fairly dark but looks a bit cloudy. Nice thick head that dissipates after a minute or so, leaving minimal lacing on my glass.
S: I immediately get a sour smell (cherries maybe?) but a bit of a fruity aroma none the less. The sweetness also comes through with a hint of raisin. 
T: The sweetness of the brew hits me with the first sip; It's a bit sweeter than other Belgians I've had. The sweetness reminds me of plums or maybe figs. As the sweet taste fades I get a hint of tartness reminiscent of cherries right before a nice spicy alcohol warmth - but it isn't boozy. The alcohol is very subtle for an 11.3% brew.
M: It's a substantial beer but isn't too heavy on the tongue. It has a nice medium body and is oh so smooth. The alcohol is warming but not overbearing. 
D: Amazing drinkability & it keeps getting better as it warms a bit. The smoothness of the beer is still baffling considering its ABV. It may be a slow sipper but I'll definitely drink more of this one - a good beer to pair up with some deserving food. 1,162 characterswalteez, Jan 27, 2011
4.92/5  rDev +10.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5I recently tried this beer as a "quad" recommendation from this site. Slowly compiling a few select beers that are deemed necessary to those that appreciate everything there can be about beer. So on that note, here's my thoughts on the Trappistes Rochefort 10
A: It poured smooth and reddish brown, with anticipated carb and a 1/2 inch head. It dissipated within 45 seconds. The brew was cloudy but solid, not murky in any way. As soon as it was poured, I immediately wanted to taste!
S: Sweet, also a minorly perfumy, which wasn't at all unpleasant. It was very balanced actually and was alive and inviting.
T: This brew is built very well. the palate was slightly sweet on the back of the tongue. None of the ingredients overpowered another, and the alcohol didn't linger. Hints of the sweet malt stayed after that was very comforting.
M: Amazingly smooth, not a heavy beer but definitely not a light beer either. Medium in body, even carbonation, almost perfect on the tongue. 
D: I had one bottle and I could readily have a few more EASILY. Because the brew was smooth and inviting, the higher alcohol content (over 11%) snuck up by the last draught from my glass. I would recommend this beer to anyone who loves Belgian, or beer in general. Its on my list of top 5 beers I've ever had. Enjoy!

4.68/5  rDev +4.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5What a wondrful beer!
Smell: slightly sweet with a hint of yeast.
Apperance: Thick dark brown color with no light passing through. Head was pale tan and dissapeared quickyly leaving a thin lingering ring of bubbles around the egde of the glass.
Taste; sweet and complex. Fruity with hints of raisins, prunes(!), pears and butter. No hops, carmel malts, well hidden alcohol.
Mouthfeel: Very, very smooth, creamy.
Drinkability: Very! This is an outstanding beer with so many levels in it. The flavors are robust and subtle at the sme time. And as the beer sat and warmed it became better and better. It should be sipped, savored, and enjoyed. 640 characterssubs, Jan 25, 2011
4.77/5  rDev +6.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4looks deep dark brown, with a thin and non lasting off white head that is very rocky and good lacing.
lots of dates and raisins as well as some distinct sourness with a strong sugary smell. no hops at all. I had to come back to this but after I tasted it I was able to place one of the scents as butterscotch.
oh my god.... OMFG! everything in this beer that defines the style is here, but in an extremely well balanced fashion. sugary sweet and fruity, all the while having a light buttery backbone and sweet extremely light peppery alcohol. I could go on about the flavors in here but i wish to move on to the mouthfeel.
moderate body but full mouthfeel, slightly creamy essence and extremely light carbonation. sweet and dry balance in the finish.
as with most quads, drinkability is where this truly exceptional brew falters. Far to thick and filling to be a session beer, and a bit to sweet to mix it up.
Holy crap....I have seen this beer on the top 100 and have been wanting to try it, I tried the 8 an was not super impressed, but this beer blew me AWAY. On top of all this I can barely taste the extremely high amount of alcohol that this beer possesses. 1,168 charactersryanonline, Jan 25, 2011

4.35/5  rDev -2.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5This beer has been extensively reviewed. Accordingly, I will take the liberty of simply describing what struck me about it:
1. Sweet. A lot sweeter than I was expecting.
2. Despite #1, it was still not overly so. It is a very rich flavor, complex, with hints of dark brown sugar and ripe fruit.
3. Not a lot of head, not very strong lacing on the glass, but a nice molasses color to the beer. Carbonation is in small bubbles, adding to the creamy mouth feel.
It is truly a lovely beer, and I especially like the high ABV as I sit in my house on another 10 degree (Fahrenheit) day. 582 charactersbgjohnston, Jan 23, 2011
4.62/5  rDev +3.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.5The appearance was of a very dark amber, almost black. On pouring it was slightly cloudy but the sediment soon settled.
The smell was of exotic fruit but with a little acidity 
Now most importantly, the taste. It was well worth the £4 price tag for a single bottle as it was an extremely rich and lingering taste with some spirity after taste which may not to some peoples liking.
 After a few minutes of drinking it, it had warmed this only made the taste develop darker and richer, my only complaint on taste was if left to warm too much then a hint of burnt fruit may be detected.
Definitely one to try If you haven't already

A-Poured a dark chocolate brown with thin, creamy head. THe bubbles never stopped moving in this beer, as if there were an alka-seltzer at the bottom. Probably just imagining this, but the beer glass felt "heavier", as if the beer were more dense.
S-Amazing. Dried fruit, caramel, coffee, and chocolate. Very nice at room temperature. Even took a whif of the empty bottle the next morning and it still smelled good. 
T - Just a beautiful beer. Really too complex to describe, but very rich and satisfying from start to finish, but especially at room temperature. Small hints of alcohol which is amazing considering this beer is 11.5% ABV. 
M - Good carbonation. The alcohol finally comes off the beer if you let it linger in your mouth for awhile. Finishes with a sweet, fruit taste.
Overall an amazing brew. This is a true craft beer and I'm thankful to the generations of monks who have put their heart and soul into this. 1,033 charactersmasstransplant, Jan 22, 2011

Smell: heavily buttered toast, loads of caramelized sugars, brown sugar, raisin. Smells like baking with a ton of butter. Taste: dark brown sugar, buttered toasted raisin bread. Background peppery note. Mouthfeel: Medium-full bodied but with the perfect amount of carbonation to keep it smooth and drinkable without shortening the experience (unlike overcarb'd 6 and 8). Drinkability: There is no alcohol in this beer...right?
I was underwhelmed by 8 and hugely disappointed by 6, but 10 is a really nice relaxed dessert-ish beer.

T: Damn. Not as good as previous bottles I've had, but still incredibly delicious. I love this beer. Dark fruit (cherries, figs), candied sugars, honey, a little spice, malts.

4.47/5  rDev 0%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from an 11.2oz bottle into a tulip.
Pours a murky, dark brown with a 1 and half finger light brown head initially that quickly fades to a thin off white cap.
Aroma is very strong with a lot going on. Sweet malts and yeast are present, as well as some dark fruits, cherry, plum. A light alcohol scent seems to be in the background as each new aroma presents itself. Spicy as well (cinnamon?). Brown sugar and/or molasses are here too. As noted before, really a lot going on here.
Taste is just as complex as the nose. Initially some dark fruit flavors up front followed by a candied sugar/brown sugar punch in the middle. Some spices, nose still gives a cinnamon aroma but it's not here in the taste. Some yeast and sweet malts. Sweet all the way through really. I get a lingering fruitiness on the tongue, almost in the same way bitter hops stick to the tongue with an IPA. Alcohol warmth at the back of the throat that gets stronger as the beer warms.
Medium to full bodied with a good amount of carbonation that feels prickly and tingly on the tongue. Even with the prickly and tingling sensations it somehow feels smooth all the way through. 
Very enjoyable beer to drink. At 11.3% ABV you're only going to have one but it's takes a while to sip it anyway. Different flavors in each sip, even more as it warms in the glass. Definitely one to enjoyed over an extended period. 1,389 charactersms11781, Jan 19, 2011
4.68/5  rDev +4.7%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Finally broke the bank and decided to try this strongly recommended belgian ales. Worth every penny! 
A - Poured a deep brown with red hints and a voluminous brown head. 
S - Even on the pour, the rich burnt smell came thru. On closer examination, a vanilla and brown sugar aroma surfaced.
T - It starts very smooth, and then a burst of roasted malts and warmth of alcohol emerges. 
M - Heavily carbonated, but not overpowering. 
D -This is one to sip. But each sip packs such a punch that it makes this a brew to be reckoned with. I'm not always a big fan of high ABV brews, nor all that Belgium has to offer, but this one's a keeper. YUM! 645 charactersKomodoDragon, Jan 19, 2011
3.81/5  rDev -14.8%look: 4 | smell: 3 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Poured from the 11.2 oz. bottle into a chalice. 
The Rochefort 10 pours dark brown into the chalice, forming a 1/2 inch off-white head that leaves whisps of lacing along the surface of the glass
The beer has a nose of Belgian yeast and caramel malt. There is also an oily/alcohol smell that can barely be detected. 
It opens with a rich caramel malt rounded out by the hints of the Belgian yeast. The beer is sweet, but not cloyingly so, as it has a crisp, dry finish. The presence if the alcohol is noticable; however, it does not overwhelm the beer, even with the 11.3 ABV. 
This beer is medium/full bodied with a whole lot of carbonation. The sweetness of the malt lingers in the finish cleanly without leaving an oily film over the tongue. 
This beer is very drinkable and gets better as it warms... Even with it's high ABV, this beer goes down well. 10 cheers for Rochefort. 884 charactersBamaViper1, Jan 18, 2011

S tangy up front; followed by deep candied maltness and dark fruits; truly complex and almost intimidating to try to describe; I've honestly never found a beer that produces all the aromas at once
T - deep fruit and alcohol immediately after tasting; a touch of nut and fig, maybe a bit of sweet chocolate and coffee; again, candied sweet malts are present throughout; again, a very complex beer
M - coats the tongue nicely; bold, but not in a bad way; very nice
D - goes down smooth and pleasantly; leaves me satisfied and content after just one, but still wanting more; in fact, I may have to grab a few the next time a go out, to cellar a couple 876 charactersboudreaux, Jan 17, 2011
4.2/5  rDev -6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Bottled on date: 12/31/08
Ive had this 2 year old in my fridge for a while, and this seemed like a good time to drink! Poured this one into a nice sized tulip. A cloudy, muddy brown color that lets not light through at all - very dense looking. I got just under 2 fingers of light tan head that settled to a creamy layer of foam that hung around during consumption.
First whiff brought lots of darker fruits, mainly plum and raisin. Also get some sweeter malt aromas, some chocolate notes, and a pretty strong alcohol presence. Those darker fruits are the upfront flavor in this quad, a nice fig and plum character. Also get a big dose of alcohol (i thought it may have subdued over 2 years in the cellar but that isn't the case from what I remember). The finish seems to have a nice dark / semi-sweet chocolate touch that does leave a nice aftertaste.
This quad is on the lower end of medium bodied (bordering on light), with a nice level of carbonation. A nice beer for a cold winter night, a fireplace, and a good book / movie.
I haven't had this in about a year, and that was fresh. Although I like the 10 alot, I prefer some of the other similar beers a bit more. 1,172 charactersprdstmnky, Jan 17, 2011
4.58/5  rDev +2.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I've had this one hanging out in the cellar for 6+ months
Poured into my New Belgium glass
Pours a dark, dark brown but not completely opaque. There is a couple inches of light tan head that settles to a couple of mm's.
Smell is interesting. Slightly sour, a little bit of sweet grape and rum. I had a stone RIS last night and I have to say I prefer this smell profile. 
Immediately you get the raisin, plum, and rum sweetness that good quads showcase. There is a hint of the sweet grape as well and a bit of the sour flavor towards the end. Absolutely delicious.
This beer has a tendency to just coat the mouth in a nice way while still managing to be quite carbonated. The carbonation doesn't really hit until the end, so you're able to enjoy the way the beer hangs around the mouth.
I tried this one fairly early in my craft beer drinking career. This was probably my fifth, and oldest (although certainly could handle a couple of years without problem), and on par with previous bottles. It probably is one of my top 3 favorite beers and really exemplifies why this style is currently my favorite. It will be interesting to try it next to my recently acquired Westy 12. If it wasn't $6 a bottle I could drink it weekly. 1,229 charactersCruisaC, Jan 16, 2011

A: Deep dark brown colored beer, creates a neat 2 fingers of brownish foam. (poured in a Kasteel Trappist chalice) 
S: Smokey flavor, slight hint of citrus fruit.
T: Very full flavor, a little bitter but fruity too. Hop is very noticeable. Well rounded saturating beer.
M: Light carbonation, chocolate aftertaste. 
D: Full flavor, the alcohol is hardly noticeable, this is a serious beer so I would not drink more then 2 at a time, this will blur the taste of lighter beers.
This is the type of beer that I would like to drink with a nice steak, the flavor is very powerful so it can be enjoyed next to other strong flavors. 761 charactersDuncanIdaho, Jan 15, 2011

A: A warming dark brown with a small light brown head that is short lived. When held up to light a golden brown is scene on the outer edges. Mild lacing. 
S: Ohhhh. Sharp and delicious. Deep dark fruits paired with an intoxicatingly sweet maltiness. Rich.
T: Everything I hoped it would taste like! The dark fruits paired with a perfect malt balance. Not to be overpowered by the notes of alcohol. The flavor stays with you, clinging to your pallet. It is just heavenly. I am amazed about how sweet it is; and yet, it is still such a full bodied bombardment of rich "quadness." Worth every penny of the 6 bucks i paid for one bottle. 
M: Light carbonation with a slightly dry finish. 
D: Well, all things being said, this beer s at the top of my list. I could drink maybe two of them, but that would be a heavenly two drinks. After that I would want to move on to something a little less good as to not adulterate the quad with drunken haziness. 1,003 characterscheftasia28, Jan 15, 2011
4.23/5  rDev -5.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Reviewed from notes...
Appearance: Great fig-date brown coloration for the body, holding a big frothy white head which quickly dissipates. Little lacing
Smell: Very "winelike" with lots of dark fruit esters. As it warms a sweetness increases, but the nose stays relatively balanced.
Taste: Lots of the same fruity esters as were on the nose. Very little to no alcohol heat, which is strange for a beer at 11% ABV. The taste remains sweet, but not cloyingly so.
Mouthfeel: Definitely not syrupy or thick, this beer remains very light for the ABV, and has a nice amount of carbonation.
Drinkability: Where i was nervous at first, looking at the "11%," i found this to be a wonderful beer, and extremely drinkable. For the mere history behind this beer, it's worth checking out, but upon the first taste, you find an incredible beer which was artfully crafted and meant to be slowly enjoyed. I'll be putting more of these in the beer fridge for future consumption... 968 charactersamcmaho1, Jan 15, 2011
4.83/5  rDev +8.1%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Very good beer from start to finish. Drank from a sniffer glass.
Appearance was dark brown with a small tan head. Laced well down the side of the glass.
Smell was almost perfect, very woody with hints for fruit, spices, breads and floral odors. The only thing that kept this from a 5 was that this bottle that I used to rate almost smelled like the first bottle from the batch. Almost like they should have let another gallon go before processing into bottles.
Taste was absolutely perfect, rich deep flavors of chocolate, fruits and yeast. No alcohol flavor to speak of at all.
Mouthfeel was great to start with but falls of pretty fast. I like how thick it feels to start with but the longer it goes the thinner it starts to feel.
Drinkability is great. This is a good on to drink either really cold or room temp. 820 charactersjds1469, Jan 15, 2011

4.42/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4My first Rochefort, poured from a 330 ml bottle into a chalice. 
Appearance: Deep brown with a hint of deep purple. Head starts creamy white and rather thick, dissipating to an uneven, thin covering which holds together well. Some sticky lacing.
Smell: Sweet - candied fruits and brown sugar. I associate this sweet of a smell with warm pecan pie. Behind the sweetness is alcohol, which was not obvious until the beer warmed slightly.
Taste: Very strong sweetness. Deep brown sugar bordering on molasses. Tastes like the holidays. Moderate alcohol burn midway through, but rounds out soft and pleasant. Warm alcohol on the way down with lingering licorice, dry cocoa, and a certain nuttiness. Occasionally tart on the tip of the tongue. 
Mouthfeel Very full and smooth. Carbonation is low enough to allow the taste of the beer to settle on the tongue. It's just fantastic brew!
Drinkability: Sipped from a chalice, this beer is beyond pleasing. Warm, inviting, and intoxicating. Over 11%, but the rich sweetness is ever so luring. Best enjoyed on a couch or similar area, far from motor vehicles and heavy machinery! 1,121 charactersmdquigley, Jan 14, 2011

Pours murky brown with a fair fizzy-looking off white/tan head that holds a small cap but doesn't leave much lacing. 
Aroma is a lot of dark fruits, raisins, plums, figs, currants, grapes, good caramel along with toasted bread, yeast, some chocolate, a bit of molasses, candi/brown sugar. Very good strength and I seem to pick up something new each time I take a whiff. 
Flavor is a rich combination of dark fruits, plums, figs, raisins, black currants, as well as chocolate, toffee, brown sugar, caramel, molasses, toasted bread and yeast. No real alcohol in the taste, but a touch of heat as it goes down. A bit of sweetness, not much bitterness. 
Mouthfeel is medium bodied, creamy and lush, medium carbonation. Drinks all too well for such a big beer. 
It's been a few years since I've tried the 10 and to be honest I wasn't blown away the first time...felt it was a bit on the watery side but this bottle certainly isn't. Very rich, complex and delicious. Definitely holds up well to some age. 1,105 characterselgiacomo, Jan 12, 2011
4.84/5  rDev +8.3%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5appearance; hazy dark brown with a hint of red, almost a dark purple under the proper lighting. Tan head that dissipates quickly, leaving slight lacing. Foam collar around the edge of the glass and film in the center.
smell; very aromatic sweet plums and rum balance nicely with unique yeast and alcohol spice. Some cherry juice in the back end of the sniff after the alcohol spice fades out. Very complex and powerful, odors are all well represented and work well with each other...Perfect!
taste; pretty much like the smell. Upfront smooth plum and cherries. Some sourness that quickly becomes bitter in a rum-like sweet way. Aftertaste of mild citrus rind hops, before it mellows out to a delicious lactic and warm yeast. Walnuts soaked in warm spiced plum wein with candied ginger come to mind.
mouthfeel; like a cotton filled velvet pillow case. Prickly but with a classically burning alcohol, yet very gentle and soothing in a creamy way. Light and fine carbonation. All factors combined make a chewy yet medium bodied drink. Very smooth.
drinkability; not so much crisp and refreshing like most highly drinkable beers but so damn tasty and the high alcohol content is well hidden...quite a classy drink! 1,214 charactersSachsenfreude, Jan 12, 2011

"Rochefort--you da' bomb!

Rochefort--consistently probably the best beer family in the world. Not one have I ever had that was not an "A" offering, and their scarcity means when you find one [or more] that you snatch them up and savor them when you get a free moment.

4.92/5  rDev +10.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Poured into an oversized snifter. The bottle has a code that says 030215. A little research revealed that this means it was bottled March 2nd, 2010 and will be good for five years past that date (though it would probably age even longer under the proper conditions).
Appearance- 4.5 out of 5. Pours a deep, dark brown like a medieval monk's robe. The formidable tan-brown head quickly fizzles away into nothing. Once it subsides, there is a little lacing left sticking around the edges. Be warned that there is a thick yeast cake sticking to the bottom of the bottle that will plop into the glass if you don't pour carefully. Once the sediment intrudes, the beer becomes cloudy and somewhat thicker. 
Smell- 4.5 out of 5. Sweet malt and dark fruit leap out of the glass and tickle my nose with a thousand subtle nuances. Red grapes-- almost like wine, figs, plums, and vanilla swirl in an olfactory orgy. Cocoa and caramel linger afterward. Hops are nowhere to be found, but in this case, I don't miss them. The alcohol is evident at first whiff but not unpleasant-- just a bit spicy. This is a fairly fresh bottle, so it would likely mellow with age. Not quite as enticing as La Trappe Quadrupel, but damned close. 
Taste- 5 out of 5. This is one of those beers whose scents blissfully match its flavor profile. Sweet caramel malt, dark bread, and fruity esters roll through my mouth like moat waters in a storm. It's like a feast from the Dark Ages bottled and sequestered away in a dusty castle alcove, saved for me to enjoy today. Everything from the smell translates into the taste but manifests more powerfully. The alcohol is strong and spreads warmth across my face; the sedimentary yeast adds a spicy, peppery note to balance out the vanilla and fruit sweetness. Only the faintest hint of herbal hops crosses my tongue, quickly washed away by an aftertaste that reminds me of port wine. The red grape taste is strong in this beer. The banality of "mouth-gasm" seems entirely too weak for this beer; "tongue-fuck" is more appropriate.
Mouthfeel- 4.5 out of 5. Moderate to full-bodied. The port wine comparison is again applicable. Creamy and smooth except for a bit of an astringent phenolic bite on the back of the tongue. The only disconcerting note is the intense tingling on my tongue like a Fizzy Lifting Drink from Willy Wonka's factory, but that fades after a few minutes in the glass.
Drinkability- 5 out of 5. If I could drink this beer on a nightly basis, I would be a rapturously happy man. It's probably good that this beer is somewhat rare; widespread availability would irrevocably spoil our palates. I could easily drink three or four of these, but keep in mind that it's a beer better sipped than gulped. As it is, the review is concluding just as the glass is almost empty, and I want to shout like Captain Jack Sparrow, "why is the beer gone?!". La Trappe Quadrupel is still probably by favorite Quad of all time, but this one definitely gives it a run for its money. World-class. If you see it, buy it; budget be damned.
Notes: Be sure to leave this beer out of the refrigerator for at least ten to fifteen minutes before pouring it. The ideal serving temperature is around 50 degrees Fahrenheit, and the flavor profile won't fully develop unless you let it reach that level of warmth. Don't cheat yourself. 3,340 charactersjporf911, Jan 11, 2011

If I would rated this beer this first time I drank it it would have been one of those rateings you get when you look at the low reviews... I poured it to fast and got most of the sediment in my glass, the first time...I acctually didn't finish it...the second was a different story completly
You can't ask for much of a better aperance when your drinking this style with the dark chocolate look. 4.5 for still and
Little to much haze and sediment
I have issues smelling a beer after I've tasted it so I acctually had to convince my self that it would taste better then it smelled 2 minuites later...
And it the taste follows the smell remarkable well with flavours that as a rookie will take years to figuir out.... But wow, if Belgium beer need a rep, I've found one to compare all other belgiums to.. Complex, complex chocolate, coffea and malty flavors( anything dark)... With a little more acholar flavour then I like I couldn't believe it was masked like it was... But careful, one may be enough
Feel was matched by the look... Smooth feel with perfect carbonation
Careful, it drinks wayyy to easy for this abv.... Little, and I mean a little to much alcohol taste for me hense it not being a 5 here
Noted: i will buy more of these and this beer is the reason I started my cellar... This is a good beer for beer... All reviews are done on the iPhone because i make notes on it... Spelling won't be great :) 1,433 charactersGtheroux, Jan 09, 2011

s- tons of complexity. I smell malts and dark fruit. There are some caramel vanilla chocolate tones as well. Smells damn tasty
t- woah does the smell transist into the taste. The boozy flavor is perfect while warming the throat it also is very faint almost like no alcohol at all. The fruits and the caramel are very dominant but the malts round it off perfectly. So complex. So good.
m-alot of carbonation and a thick body. Perfect
d- This might be the highest I have ever rated a beer. I cannot believe that there is a quad or even a beer that is considered to be better than this one. BRAVO 705 charactersleakyfaucet12, Jan 09, 2011
4.53/5  rDev +1.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured into my LaTrappe goblet for this special occasion. Pours a dark mahagony color with average foamy head. Appears nicely carbonated, so much so that it produces a nice little foamy mound in the center of a wispy foam ring around the glass. I did happen to notice that while pouring this beer, it appears to have a rather large amount of yeast sediment.
Smells dark and menacing with a rich complex malt bill followed by fruit and alcohol.
Sweet tasting malts, stewed plums and dates.
Big alcohol tatse that hit me hard.
I also can taste a nice sutle bread or grain aspect to the taste.
Mouthfeel lighter then I would expect.
I noticed while I sampled this great beer that my tongue and lips seem to be coated with a sweet tastiness similar to powered malt when brewing a beer, I cant't explain it.
This is a powerful beer and I had a hard time just finishing the bottle. One is plenty for me since I am not a big fan of hangovers.
None the less its a good tasting beer that shows different nuiances as it warms. 1,017 charactersmicromaniac129, Jan 08, 2011

A-Extremely dark brown which lets very little light through, with a thick brown head. Decent head retention, and a little bit of lacing.
S-Malty notes, fruity aromas, faint hints of alcohol.
T-Strong sweet caramel malts, along with hop and fruit flavours, intense warming alcohol which becomes more predominant as the beer warms up.
M-A little carbonation, very full bodied.
D-Too rich to have more than one, especially with the strength of the alcohol. However as I said, I haven't had anything like this before, so it could just be that I'm not used to the style. 669 charactersdugaldh, Jan 08, 2011
4.54/5  rDev +1.6%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Appearance - kind of murky brown very reminiscent of pond water. A small head of tan foam which dispersed rather quickly but left some sticky lace residue. Rather average looking quad.
Smell - on looks alone it wasn't doing to hot but here's where you get a hint that a truly awesome beer is in store. Rich bready malt and sweet fruit accompanied by a massive amount of alcohol.
Taste - An this is where you realize your nose was right and you're in for a treat. At first you get yeast and bready/graham cracker like malt followed by huge amounts of dried fruits (plumbs, apircots, and figs), then things get slightly dry and bitter. Just enough to keep the unfermented sugars from making this overly sweet. The finish is boozy and bourbon-like warming your throat and stomach as you swallow.
Mouthfeel - heavy bodied with out a doubt and well carbonated despite the lack of a large head. Chewy feel with out being abrasive somewhat creamy.
Drinkability - I had one in about 2 minutes and I'm about to fall asleep this is definitely a sipping beer but hell why would you want to throw this back its pure heaven. A great beer from a world class brewery well worth a try. Got to thank the guys at Hops City for this one. 1,222 charactersSnamnoum, Jan 04, 2011
4.15/5  rDev -7.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4An amalgam of notes from: 1)Bottle into real pint glass in high altitude Denver, CO, and 2)Bottle into La Trappe Goblet in Belgium. 
A: Pours a dark tan with a three finger head featuring yeasty dregs. Wonderful cream and thickness. Good retention. 
Sm: Musty, yeasty, hoppy. Alcohol is very apparent. Chocolate, caramel, and nuts. Complex. A light strength scent, excepting the alcohol. 
T: Sour. Lots of yeast. An injection of the alcohol complements the notes from the nose, particularly the nutty hops. Creamy. Hoppy. Balanced and good. Excellent for the style (is there a truly bad quadrupel?). There's almost a note of milk. 
Mf: Too smooth until the climax. Creamy, delicately soft. Complements the notes in the body. 
Dr: Doesn't hide its ABV as well as their other offerings. In Denver, I'd have it again, but its price is quite high. In Belgium, it's easily affordable.
---
05.10.14: truncated re-review. Side-by-side with an Abt 12 and a Westvleteren 12.
A: Pours entirely foam - gorgeous creamy pale khaki goodness. Great fluffy frothy head overall. Excellent (~9 minute) retention. Body is a nontransparent dark reddish brown. Floating yeast is visible in the body.
Gorgeous looking beer overall.
Sm: Delightful dark fruit with impeccable subtlety. Plum, fig, dates. Dark Belgian malts. Damn good aroma for a quadrupel.
Mf: Almost perfectly coarse and dry to coax out the flavours. Near perfectly carbonated. Texture complements the taste very well. Still, it's not as delicate or fragile as the best quad. 
Not oily, gushed, hot, boozy, astringent, or harsh.
T: Dark fruits are the star here - plum, fig, dates, prunes. Belgian dark malts. Cream. Great balance and build. I'm digging it. Good depth, duration, and intensity of flavour. Amazing subtlety. Near gestalt build.
O: One of the best quads out there, definitely. But not the best. Certainly deserves to be on any Top 10 quadrupel list. They don't make 'em much better.

It smells a lot like prunes and raisins and brown sugar. It tastes very much the same, with some alcohol adding a rough edge and cutting through the sweetness. Very thick, with natural feeling carbonation. I like this a lot but it got me buzzed really quickly so I couldn't drink ton of it. 431 charactersRodneyX, Jan 02, 2011

S - Raisins, plums, cherries, figs, caramelized toffee, spicy bread dough, hints of chocolate and yeasty banana. 
T - Toasty chocolate covered in toffee, rum soaked figs, vanilla bean, clove, pepper, hints of smoke and tobacco. The finish has a warm dry bite that wraps everything up.
M - Like drinking velvet, perfect carbonation.
You could probably drink this 20 times and pick out something new and different everytime. This beer gets a lot of hype but truly lives up to it. Extremely complex. Superb. 586 charactersStaveHooks, Jan 01, 2011
4.17/5  rDev -6.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Served in a Riedel stemless snifter
The look of this beer is a very very dark and murky brown that doesn't let light pass through there is a beige foam that continues to sit on the surface and look very appealing. The smell is a wonderful tapestry of caramelized banana mixed with figs and raisins and amber candied sugar. The taste is like all of those notes concentrated down. I would have thought that to be really impressive (and while it still tastes good) there is a tad bit of sour to the flavor that I must honestly say I didn't expect to taste. The mouthfeel is rather light on the palate and goes down really smooth, a hint of bitterness in the background is it's only fault. This is a good beer to drink overall, though I don't know if it was worth the amount paid for it per oz. 791 charactersVdubb86, Dec 31, 2010

Pours a muddy brown, copper highlight, some light foamy head, no lacing. Malty as all hell, dark fruit, prune, raisin and sting of booze. Super full-bodied, creamy, very slick. The beer tastes sweet and malty mush like the aroma, full of dark fruit and malt. Pretty hot, booze stings leaving the palate numb and dry. This beer is pretty potent, very warming. Super boozy as it warms. Each sip numbs me from gums to belly!, great beer for a cold Dec night!

A. Poured a 2 finger off white head. Impressive head for a Quad. Good retention. Good lacing. 
S. Big smells coming from this one. Dark fruit, belgian yeast. Nice fruity malty smell. Really nice complex Belgian quad smell. Has the grape dark fruit smell, but more refined and balanced than others. 
T. Delicous. All of the wonderful flavors and complexities of a quad. Big malt flavors going on. Dark fruit, raisins, figs, caramel, candi sugar. Very complex taste and super well balanced. 
D. Extremely drinkable. This is the epitome of beer and a great example of why Quads are my favorite style. Whether or not St. B or Rochefort 10 is better is very marginal in my book. Still waiting to try Westvleteren 12, but Rochefort 10 is a world class beer. 791 characterssiradmiralnelson, Dec 31, 2010
4.55/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5330 ml bottle poured into St. Bernardus Goblet. Bottle dated 27/05/14, consumed 12.29.10, 19 months old.
Pours dark brown with garnet hues, thin but persistent beige head, nice effervescence visible on the slope of the goblet. Moderate signs of lacing. Beautiful clarity, garnet and ruby highlights really begin to come out as consumed.
Aromas of currants, rum raisin deserts and ice cream, tawny port, earthy wood tones, cracked fresh pepper. Subtle chocolates, bittersweet to cocoa powder, some caramel, raw sugar and rose like alcohol. Increased port and pinot character as it warms. Some sherry oxidation going on but adds complexity and melds with alcohol well.
Flavor shows plums and raisin with some concord grape upfront mineral like to slightly salty in the middle and finish with some chocolate and vanilla bean and vanilla extract. Spicy peppery yeast tones still emerge toward the finish. 
Deceptively light bodied, finishes dry with some perceptible bitterness augmented by the dry character and alcohol. Dry, chalky earthy finish reminiscent of the very best Belgian Ales. Very much reminded my of experiencing Chimay Grand Reserve for the first time 15 years ago. Had a similar experience with Rochefort 8 as well.
Overall this beer is wonderful and complex, while relatively young it ages well and shows no sign of degradation. I thought this beer was older when I was drinking it, because I was not entirely familiar with Rochefort's labeling, but it is about a year younger than I thought at 19 months since bottling. The Belgian yeast flair of the beer seems somewhat subdued, ie a touch less spicy with more malt and alcohol tones coming into the forefront, but the phenolic yeast notes are still present and accounted for in a very effervescent and rich layered brew. 1,793 charactersPBoegel, Dec 30, 2010

S: Fruity dark malts with some yeast and alcohol. When the bottle was first opened, a great waft came from the bottle, and man was it a good one
T: What the smell first brings is nothing compared to the amazing taste of the dark fruits (plum, figs, raisins). The alcohol is fairly well hidden, but is present for sure. Not surprising for 11.3% though. Some candi sugar sweetness and nice buttery phenol notes at the end too

5/5  rDev +11.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5What can I say; this is the beer that got me to truly love beer. Before this, I looked forward to a frosty Franziscaner Dunkel or Guiness with excitement, but now anything less than a Rochefort 10 doesn't get me to that place. Sadly, I live in Austin, TX, now, and Rochefort doesn't ship to TX due to tax reasons, so I leverage every trip out of the state as an opportunity to buy/drink as many 10's as possible. It has a body, flavor, smell, drinkability (especially for 11.3% ABV), and overall enjoyment that is unmatched from my experience. Still haven't had Westy 12, and think I'm going to save that for an actual visit to the monastery in Belgium. St. Bernardus ABT 12 is a decent substitute to get me by, but it and Chimay blue will never match the superior experience that a Rochefort 10 provides. Ignore the price tag and grab as many bottles as you can, then enjoy the pleasure it brings. 898 charactersboulderaz78, Dec 28, 2010

Appearance: Dark murky brown color with a 1-finger tan head that stays around for a little while and fizzes out to a ring that doesn't want to go away. Moderate to no lacing. Very cloudy with little chunks floating around.
Smell: Smells like dark fruit, toffee and fine cigar tobacco. I get a faint whiff of alcohol in there as well.
Taste: Dark fruit, butterscotch and molasses. Sweet, but not too sweet. Warming effect comes through towards the end and lingers.
Mouthfeel: Mouthfeel is thick and syrupy, almost chewy. Carbonation is low but right where it should be. The strength of the alcohol in this beer can really take you by surprise if you don't know it beforehand. It's very well masked, almost menacingly so.
Drinkability: High
I love how this comes in single 11.2 oz. bottles, that way I can afford to buy it on a regular basis without breaking the budget. It's definitely a sipper and something to be savored. A fantastic Quad. 1,085 charactersmellowmark, Dec 28, 2010
4.04/5  rDev -9.6%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3Poured into my goblet a very dark brown. Had to be held directly up to a bright lamp to get any light to pass through. In so doing, one can see quite a lot of yeast bits settling down in the bottom of the glass.
Smell is tobacco and molasses, a bit of brown sugar and dark añejo rum. Lot of rich, assertive, dark aromas. Very nice!
Many of the nuances in the smell translated over to flavour, but had a much weaker presence in the taste. Taste was mainly generic tasting sweet malts and dark rum as every iota of the 11,3% is detectable. It's still quite good, just rather aggressive and not *as* complex and intriguing in the mouth as it is in the nose.
Mouthfeel is smooth and silky with modest carbonation.
Not my favourite representation of this style, but a wonderful example nevertheless! 795 charactersSilentSabre, Dec 26, 2010

Into a snifter, it poured a very dark brown with two fingers of tan head, which both retained and laced very well. Little visible carbonation. The nose revealed plum, blackberry, raisin, date, tart cherry, cocoa, slight coffee, and the presence of alcohol. The taste revealed black cherry, chocolate, and molasses initially, then a dry tartness midpalate, and finally a smooth brown sugar finish, with some lingering tartness afterward as well. The alcohol was much more hidden in the taste versus the smell. Deeply complex, yet oh so balanced. Thick feel, yet velvety smooth, with no carbonation, and a dry bitter tartness afterward. What a great beer; I could only imagine what this would taste like aged some more. 770 charactersdonniecuffs, Dec 22, 2010

4.12/5  rDev -7.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured into a nice chalice. Even upon pour the aeration provides a giant fig smell. Minimal head, but it forms actually nicely, maintains ring throughout glass. Giant dark red/brown indian red color. No lacing whatsoever.
Smell is a predominant giant fig bomb, even off the pour. Literally a giant dominant fig bouquet. Heat, characters of a dry table wine, dry toasted faint clove spice. Fascinating mouthwatering.
If you like figs this is your beer. Giant fig taste with some big body, smells more like a dry table wine, sweet fig comes in slow then in the middle a giant punch of sugars, honey taste on the finish, not a big alcohol bomb, dry in the mouth upon finishing on the palate. Incredibly warming in the stomach after a few sips.
Drinkability is highly desired. 775 characterssmakawhat, Dec 17, 2010

Smell: Dark carmel, maybe raisin and brown sugar, there might be some cocoa in the nose as well. A very complex wonderful smell that does not get any better than this! 
Taste: MMM outstanding flavor that hides much of the high alcohol. The alcohol is there but under a lot of other flavors. Sugars, fruit, malt all there all fighting for your attention....very nice. 
Mouthfeel: Very smooth to full body. this is a nice lightly carbonated beer.
Drink: This one is going on the Xmas List for both gifts and please Santa, can I get a few in my stocking! But this is a beer to enjoy, not slam down. I would say second best behind the #6, but still an outstanding brew. 919 charactersCheckmateBrew, Dec 15, 2010
4.49/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4A - Pours a brownish red with minimal head and light lacing.
S - Dark fruits, plum, grape, fig, prune. Smells sorta like a grape airhead. Hint of Alcohol. Love the nose on this one.
T - Lots of dark fruits. Plum, grape, fig and prune. Again i get that Grape airheady flavor. Dark sugars, carmel, slight toffee. A woody/vanilla flavor. Definitely some alcohol on the back end.
M - Medium to full bodied
D - at 11.3% this beer is incredibly easy to drink. 457 characterskfsv034, Dec 15, 2010
4.65/5  rDev +4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Poured from bottle into duvel tulip
A - Pours a dark amber/brown color with a 2 finger khaki head. The head thins down fairly quick leaving very little lacing. 
S - dark fruit, cherry, caramel, sugar, vanilla, bourbon barrel, light woodyness, very light booze scent
T - WOW, simply amazing, complex with alot more to it than i could pick out from the nose, figs, plum, light chocolate, vanilla/bourbon barrel, slightly nutty, just so much going on here!!
M - feels great, just the right amount of carbonation, medium to light in body, slightly silky, creamy, nice residual flavor and feel on the finish. 
D - The alcohol is covered very well and with how complex it is, you just want to keep on sipping to try and figure it out. 
Overall, this is a phenomenal beer!! I will most defiately be purchasing a few bottles of this to cellar and drink in the future. It's spendy at ~$5/11.2oz bottle but totally worth it IMO.... I have never had something so complex yet well rounded and TASTY!!!! 996 charactersSurlyMe, Dec 12, 2010
4.45/5  rDev -0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5This deservedly-renowned beer has a rich, dark colour. It pours with a little viscosity. The head forms quickly... it needs a slow, easy pour. Suprisingly, since it starts out like beaten egg whites, the also-pop-like head is gone before I can have a sip, and leaves no lacing. The sediment / yeast is nearly black! I didn't think it would be so dark. 
In the smell is... root beer is what I actually get first! Cinnamon rolls, molasses, orange, an almost minty smell, and some chocolate. There's an awful lot going on in there.
The flavour? Wow. Information overload! It's so complex, I don't know where to start. It's earthy. The exhale is nice. There is a strong taste of figs / dates, and still a bit of root beer (that sweetness coming out). It's slightly woody, maybe even walnutty, in a way, with a blood orange aftertaste... almost gets a bit tart as it nears its end... similar to a mincemeat or raisin tart.
The fizz feels a bit strong at first... it seems you can feel it go down your throat, but that's probably the 11.3% alcohol it has in it, although the taste of it never really enters into your mind. It's smooth overall, with a bit of a viscous finish. 
Overall, it's a sipper, and a great one at that. It's very complex, but not so rich or dense as to put you off it. 1,289 charactersPEIBeerGuy, Dec 11, 2010
4.8/5  rDev +7.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured from a 11.2 oz bottle into a stone Vertical Epic glass
A: Pours a dark brown hue that exhibits hints of burgandy/red when held up to any light source. A cream colored head develops quite nicely soon after the pour and lasts throughout the entire drinking session, as does the lacing. This beer also displays a good amount of body when swirled around within the glassware.
S: Tons of grape and dark fruit qualities that remind me of welch's grape juice...in a good way of course. Caramelized and brown sugar qualities are prevalent in the aroma as well. Some oak-like character is detectable at the tail end of the smell, but could be contributed to an some oxidation from aging.
T: Again, imagine Welch's grape juice with tons of complexity attributed to residual sugar and fig-like flavors. Some alcohol burn, but not enough to distract from the robust...yet delicate flavor this beer exhibits. 
M: Light carbonation, creamy during the middle with a a slightly dry finish.
D: Basically finished a whole bottle within a 20 minute session...it's that good! 
Overall: This is as good, if not better than Westy 12! I've never been a huge Quad guy, but this has cracked my top ten of favorite beers all-time. This will be a constant in my cellar for years to come! A must try! Cheers! 1,293 charactersOlieIPA, Dec 10, 2010

4.08/5  rDev -8.7%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Tasting from a bottle smuggled in my backpack from Belgium since we don't get any many their great beers here. Poured into a Chimay Goblet (don't tell the Belgiums I did this, they're awful particular about their glassware), taking care to INCLUDE the yeast and sediment at the bottom of the bottle.
A - Dark cola like appearance, opaque. No head or lacing to speak of.
S - Starts off sweet, honey, dark fruits, and definitely alcohol - though you really have to swirl the beer and stick your nose into it to get them. It does open up somewhat as it warms.
T - raisins, currants, berries, and wonderful malt (I'm not a malt person, either). No real hop bitterness to speak of, though it ends with a alcoholic bite and something like a tartness or sourness (not in a bad way at all).
M - low carbonation, with that alcoholic bite
D - The alcohol and sweetness makes this a real sipper.
This beer only improves as you let it warm. Give it time (and if you don't want to end up under the table, you will), and you will be very satisfied. A lovely beer to have on a cold evening, but not one I'd reach for impulsively, though this is the best quad I've ever had. 1,160 characterschchchchia, Dec 05, 2010

appearance - pours a dark raisin tone, head has strong carbonation bubbles, very silky in appearance, thin and spotty lacing
smell - bold dark and sweet malts, aromas of berries and dark fruit, raspberry, apple, fig
taste - dark fruit and malts permeate the senses, alcohol burn and light alcohol flavor in the finish, complex fig/raisin/date/apple flavors, perhaps some dark berry as well, a bit hot, this is massive beer
mouthfeel - medium body but heavily carbonated which gives the impression of a huge body, some burn
drinkability - this one is quite the sipper, with an 11%+ abv and major complexity going on, it's a beer for taking your time and savoring, one of the best to do it with i might add! 887 charactersdjbreezy, Dec 05, 2010

Smell is somewhat fantastic somewhere between raisins and hazelnuts.
The taste goes from portwinelike slowly to a rather malty phase being heavy and smooth at the same time.
The 11% alcohol leave a comfortable warmth in the throat.
An amazing beer! 310 charactersstoepsel, Dec 04, 2010
4.11/5  rDev -8.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a deep, dark brown with light brown highlights. Has a thin khaki colored head that dissipates pretty quickly, leaving a nice ring that lasts throughout and leaves pretty good lacing.
Surprisingly faint aroma. Notes of roasted malts, dark fruits, and alcohol
Strong flavors of dark fruits and malts, with notes of yeast, spice, dark chocolate, and just the slightest hint of vanilla. There is an ever-present alcohol warmth that really intensifies at the finish. This beer really shows is alcohol content.
Light/medium body, higher carbonation level. The mouthfeel is excellent. Very smooth, with just a little effervescence that gives it a certain crispness.
Good taste and a perfect feel make this a very drinkable beer, but with the high alcohol content, you're going to want to take it slow with this one. 818 charactersRDHerm, Dec 04, 2010

Pours a dark brown with a thin fizzy head, which doesnt stick around. The nose is sweet with dark fruits, bready malt. Taste is fairly smooth, easy on the palatte experienceing much of what it smells like. Rasins, dried fruits...Heavy mouthfeel, ends chewy and dry. ABV is well hidden but noticeable as it warms.
Overall, not as impressed as the hype led me to believe to be honest. 397 charactersheebes, Dec 02, 2010

This is a very good beer, well made and complex, but the dark fruit flavors don't really do it for me. Nevertheless, this is definitely a top notch beer. 429 charactersgoalie33, Nov 30, 2010
4.2/5  rDev -6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Had this on 2012-05-04 in Columbia, PA
A - Opaque ruby/dark brown with a chocolate 1-finger head that fades quickly. Some floaties from the sediment at the bottom of the bottle.
S - Rich malt, figs, prunes, touch of chocolate. 
T - Barrel-aged figgy pudding with turbinado sugar and ginger. Sweet and rich tasting. Definitely some warming alcohol. Hint of leafy hops. 
M - Medium body and carbonation. A bit sticky but also creamy and easy to drink. A soft mouthfeel.
O - Quite nice. It's along the lines of a De Struise Pannepot, which I like better.
Initially had this on 2010-11-26 at The Library in Pittsburgh.
A - Brown and dark red. The head fades quickly but leaves good lacing. 4.0
S - Smells of plums, brown sugar and anise. 4.0
T - Pretty complex. Tastes of plums, figs, molasses, bread and medicinal herbs. Mild hops bite. Moderately sweet, which helps disguise the alcohol. A little sourness to the finish too. 4.5
M - Thick body and low carbonation. Clingy but not overly so. 4.0
D - A definite sipper. Take the time to savor this delicious brew. 4.0
Notes- from 2012-12-31 After tastings of the (arguably) top four Belgian Quads, I would rate them in this order for my personal taste preference:
1 = Pannepot
2 = Westvleteren XII
3 = Rochefort 10
4 = St. Bernardus Abt 12.
Of interest, my wife would rate them in this order:
1 = St. Bernardus Abt 12
2 = Pannepot
3 = Westvleteren XII
4 = Rochefort 10
Quads aren't my favorite style, but I/we enjoyed everything about this beer and the others mentioned above. For the two of us, it came down to a style preference. I like a challenging brew and she likes a well-balanced, un-assuming brew. 1,668 charactersTucquan, Nov 29, 2010

4.87/5  rDev +8.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Served cold 11.2 ounce bottle into glass beer challis
A) An awesome Quad. Dark chocolate brown with off white head that settles quickly. Very thick and opaque with yeasties and sediment at the bottom. Ample carbonation is suspended in this soup. 
S) Wow! Sweet caramel dipped candy apple. Hint of ginger, apricot, citrus -- it's all there.
T) If you are a quad lover, your search is over. Sweet caramel, burnt chocolate, dark fruit - dates, raisons, figs. It's all there and in correct proportion.
M) The head dissipates quickly but plenty of fine carbonation lasts and lasts. Very smooth, refreshing & complex. The alcohol is well masked but you'll know you got what you paid for as you stumble (and mumble) around...
D) An outstanding quad -- perhaps the zenith of quads. If this is the style you prefer, look no further. 828 charactersbskrtz, Nov 27, 2010
4.87/5  rDev +8.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5A: Excellent nut brown color with a creamy tan head that creates an excellent lace at the start. Dissipated more quickly than I had hoped, but left a nice half finger remaining for the remainder of the glass.
S: Exceptional aroma to this beer. The malt character is extremely complex covering dark brown sugar and slight notes of coffee. Some fruit comes through--grapes mostly. Alcohol is mild on the nose.
T: Also very complex. The malts range from caramel to some earthy molasses notes. Lots of alcohol at the very start and very end, giving it a certain heat. Fruits, especially golden raisins come through. Yeasty esters give a slight spice.
M: Exceptionally smooth and full bodied. Excellent feel from the start to the medium finish.
D: Excellent sipping beer. I'd stick to two because of the full body. It fills you up. The price tag is forbidding in terms of drinking it all night as well, so I don't mind. 918 charactersryantaussig, Nov 27, 2010
4.37/5  rDev -2.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Bottle poured into a tulip glass. I can't really tell when the date is. My understanding is that they date it 5 years from the bottling date, so this would've been bottled September 2010.
Look: opens with some smoke lurking out at the top of the bottle. Dark cherry color, with some muddy ruby highlights when held up to a light. The head is fairly thin despite an aggressive pour. Its a sandstone color, which is something I've never seen, and I like it. There's a little carbonation visible despite the darkness. This is the darkest quad I've seen, which doesn't say much since I haven't had that many. 
Smell: dark fruit, especially purple grapes, raisins and figs really pop out. There's also some rum qualities to it and the alcohol aroma is clear. There's some yeasty aromas and some spices like pepper as well. 
Taste: thus far, this is the best quad that I've had, but keep in mind I think this is only my third. It follows the nose well with dark fruit like grapes, raisins, and figs popping out to me the most, some rum alcohol tastes coming through as well with some spices lurking in the background.
Feel: full bodied, some carbonation, some alcohol warmth, not much bitterness. 
Drink: nicely drinkable and went with my meal nicely. I wouldn't have this all night but, at 11.3% ABV, if I tried I might die. 
Overall, this is my first trappist quad and I really liked it. I wasn't sure if I should age it or if I should just drink it fresh and ultimately decided to drink it fresh. Next, I'll try and find an aged one or age one myself and compare. This is clearly worth its reputation. Cheers! 1,612 charactersSkunkWorks, Nov 26, 2010
4.13/5  rDev -7.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Had this in a 11.2 oz bottle in a Great Divide balloon glass. Thanks mom!
This beer pours a dark, dark brown inth a rocky off-white head. The head died down pretty fast (I think my mom recently washed her glass with a bit too much soap, sigh), but it was excellent while it lasted. Very tight bubbles. As the head dies down, the light is able to penetrate thhe beer and it shows some orange tinge to that brown. Nice. The only real problem is that I accidentally purée a bit too much into the glass and ended up with some yeasty sediment. Oops.
The smell is dominated by dark fruits soaked in rum. Not too different from the Trois Pistoles that I had last night, except a bit less spicy. Not quite as magical as I would have expected from it's reputation.
The flavor is complex and fruity. Definite rum bite from the booze, but it doesn't linger and gives a generally pleasant aftertaste. Not as spicy as I would have expected. Definitely has enough depth and character to give me a slightly different impression every time I take another sip.
The mouthfeel is excellent, definitely in line with every other excellent trappist beer I've had. The tight bubbles give way to a smoothness and richness that is just heavenly.
The drinkability is very good, but I'm not knocking people over to get more of it. I guess I expected more from the beer given its reputation, but now that I've had it, I think I'll just stay with my St. Bernardus that I can acquire much easier down in Texas. 1,486 charactersUTCengOwl, Nov 25, 2010

The tastes are not quire as dark and not how I expected given the nose. The malt and yeast do a lot of the talking here. taking over. The fruits are a little more acidic, and much juicier, not as dried, on the palate. The plum flavor really comes through. The body is full with light, but somewhat stinging carbonation and a long fruity and burning finish. I really do not enjoy how hot this drinks right now. Will have to reinvest and lay this down for a couple years. 630 charactersclaspada, Nov 24, 2010
4.55/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4An outstanding beer that I've enjoyed many times, but finally decided to rate. Opened up a bottle I've had for about six months and poured into a tulip glass (from New Belgium Brewery).
A nice dark brown pour with an off white head that produces nice lacing. The smell hints at the complexity of the beer--dark fruits, dark chocolate and bit of spice. A very smooth, full flavored beer. The dark chocolate flavor, though subdued and balanced, comes through along with tastes of raisin and roast. A nice boozy tasty lingers on the taste buds. A well carbonated beer that is very smooth and dangerously drinkable given how potent it is.
A classically fantastic Belgian quad that stands above almost any other I've tasted. 721 characterssmithdc33, Nov 21, 2010
4.17/5  rDev -6.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4.5Trappistes Rochefort 10 poured muddy dark brown with a short tan head that quickly fell leaving vertical streaks of lace. By the end, it left a crystal clear, laceless glass.
The smell and flavor were very good with rich, and not too sweet, alcohol soaked dark fruit--lots of raisin and a hint of black cherry. The alcohol flavor was very prominent yet pleasant. The feel was fleeting with slight breadiness and the slightest lingering dry bitterness left on the tongue. The high alcohol level is warming without being overwhelming. 
With great subtle fruit notes and high alcohol presence, Rochefort 10 would serve well as a special occasion beer, a winter warmer, or a holiday beer. Better than most marketed specifically for those purposes. 745 charactersMetalHopHead6, Nov 21, 2010

Pours into a Lost Abbey chalice a rather dark, almost chocolate grape color with a large and puffy, slightly marooned color head of about three fingers in size. 
Aroma is fruity and less yeasty than expected. Dark fruits, figs, large dose of raisins, a hint of alcohol. 
Flavor is filled raisins, champagne, alcohol, and figs. Darkly fruity with a lot of character. I am not really digging the overall flavor though. This one seems sweet and sticky and slightly cloying. Really just tastes like raisin puree or tapenade. Quite medicinal and a hot alcohol burn. There is a familiar taste in there I cant put my finger on; almost like a mixed drink I had long ago and didnt care for. 
I dont know about this one. I know it is supposed to be some world class beer, but I dont really care for it. Its good, but not "best in the world" good. Perhaps I am missing the boat on this one, but I dont care for it. 952 charactersSaCkErZ9, Nov 21, 2010

Pours a almost completely opaque dark brown color, with a one finger head that fades slowly, lacing down the glass is fabulous. Aroma is very complex, with fig, raisin, dark malts, plum, and other dark fruits all combining to open up the nostrils with a sweet aroma. Again, incredibly complex. Fig, raisin, plumb, faint dark malts, slight hop balance, Rich, fruity aftertaste, faint alcohol taste slightly warming the tongue, but comes out in the aftertaste.
Full bodied and complex, the mouthfeel is outstanding, and a very smooth, perfectly carbonated. As strong as this is, it tastes so good, and has such good mouthfeel that I could sip on this for days on end.
Wow. Just wow. I have had this before a few times, but after a six month hiatus and expanding my pallet I can really appreciate this more. A truly outstanding brew, gotta tip my hat to those monks! 968 charactersramseye4, Nov 21, 2010

Pours a really cloudy dark mahogany with a thick two-finger off-white head on top. Light lace left behind. Scents of grape, plum, strawberry, yeast, and light booze. Very fruity nose. 
The mouth is creamy with subtle carbonation play on the tongue. The flavors remind me of an old ale. Dark fruits like plum, some licorice, molasses. The booze isn't noted in the flavor but I can feel it a bit. Very smooth mellow Quad. I will definitely get this one again.

I could immediately smell vinuous dark grapes while pouring this from bottle to glass. Put my nose to it and got brown sugar, prunes, raisins, sweet esters! Mild alcohol. more going on but too complex to detail.
Taste is again vinuous with prunes, berries, yeasts and some bready notes in the finish, decent Hops and bitterness. swished it around and got more fruit, cherries then the prunes and such! Man, this is complex.
Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied, nice zesty carbonation, medium alcohol warmth, some hop bite and dryness.
A definite brew to savor and explore. Many flavors to explore. A lot of character in this one! 11% abv is well hidden! 693 charactersfourplayed, Nov 08, 2010

Definitely in top 5 beers that I have tried -- similar to Chimay Blue. Even though it's $5.99/bottle at Jungle Jim's it's worth it! 250 charactersmikepreed, Nov 06, 2010

4.32/5  rDev -3.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 3.5Around 55°F, served in a Chimay goblet.
Appearance - A quite dark brown, fading towards black. Murky, with lots of visible sediment swirling about. A nice, thick mocha colored head that sticks around quite reliably, and leaves behind moderate lace.
Smell - Strong yeast smells abound, with roasty malts underlying. Hop smell is a little bit spicy but is nearly occluded by the yeast and malt. Esters present a slight cherry and slighter banana smell at the end of the nose.
Taste - Sweet cherry notes riddling the rich, roasted malty character of the brew. Hovering somewhere between medium and full bodied, the carbonation really opens the sweetness and fruit on the tongue. Alcohol burn doesn't wait to announce itself. You know it right from the get go, and it doesn't leave until after a slight caramel taste comes out in the sweetness on the finish. A small hop bitterness mitigates the sweetness, keeping it from becoming cloying. Aftertaste is pleasant, with the caramel emerging more, and remains for some time.
Mouthfeel - Simultaneously creamy and bubbly. The carbonation really opens up the taste, and the creaminess really enriches it, allowing it to stick on the tongue. Alcohol produces a bit of burn but not unpleasantly so.
Drinkability - The richness and sweetness of this beer, along with the slight burn of alcohol, make this a beer that does not lend itself well to sessioning. However, these qualities also make that first glass, and perhaps the second, a quick and thrilling journey. Moderately drinkable. 1,533 charactersChronofied, Nov 03, 2010
4.15/5  rDev -7.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured a rich, dark, opaque brown color, with a thin, light brown head, that quickly dissipates. Aromas of freshly baked bread, molasses, dried fruits and chocolate. On the palate, this on is medium bodied and nicely balanced, with prunes, brown bread, raisins, chocolate and sweet sugars, and a little alcoholic punch. A very good beer. 337 charactersemmasdad, Nov 02, 2010
4.52/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5I must say all quads have a drinkability like no other beer. I don't prefer quads all that much but I must say when they go down they simply go down.
A: Deep and rich brown color with a creamy tan lace, with some stickiness to it.
S: Spicy raisin and plum smell to it.
T: Semi alcoholic taste to it... lost of that rasin and plum in the taste as well... interesting quad.
M: Rolls over the tongue like it was nothing but a juice.
D: Beers like this make me wonder why they don't like children drink beer cause it's so damn easy to drink.
 Just kidding on the children thing. 580 charactersrevolt914, Nov 02, 2010
4.58/5  rDev +2.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Glad to get this again. It never disappoints. Poured from bottle into a Chimay goblet. Nice deep, dark brown nutty color with a slight head and a little light lacing. The aroma is not overpowering but inviting. Sweet smell of dark fruit, some malty aroma, with a hint of alcohol.
Amazing taste. Dark fruit, raisins, chocolate and I sense coffee, but more likely a roasted toffee-like taste. Very complex, but you can almost pick out a new flavor with each sip.
For the high ABV, the alcohol seems even more masked in the taste than in the aroma. Very enjoyable to sip and the flavors seem to come out more as it warms up. I expected a world class beer and this did not disappoint. 682 charactersFanofHefe, Nov 01, 2010

A- Like coca-cola. Nice fizzy one inch espresso head. Deep rich coffe black. 
S- Weet with brown sugar and notes of caramel. The most dominate flavors are chocolate and dark cherry with notes of vanilla. 
T- Deep velvety chocolate with high notes of dark cherry and honey. A slight vanilla mixed in. A littel bit of toffee. 
M- Thick and velvety. I know I already used velvety once, but its a velvety beer. Smooth with a well balanced body. Slight carbonation. Nice on the tounge.
D- Very strong yet smooth. Definitely a sipping beer. Liquid dessert. Rich and dark. Savor each sip. Long finish of delicious chocolate and dark cherry. 713 charactersJayS2629, Oct 30, 2010

The nose has subtle raisins and dark fruit with some malts and touch of alcohol. Very complex taste, full of subtleties ranging from raisins, dark fruits, sweet flat cola, dark sugars, very little anise but it's there mixed with the rest of the flavors and some alcohol. A very nice carbonation which is on the minimal to medium side, the bubbles are tiny. A very complex and interesting quad that everyone should try. 480 charactersnas5755, Oct 30, 2010
4.1/5  rDev -8.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5This is a beer that I have come to love over time. Every time I have it I taste something different than the last. What is it about the monks that make them brew such magical offerings such as this? You can really tell the difference between the water used in this beer vs. other quads/belgians. I think thats what does it, well, that and the years of this yeast being developed. I have read reviews where they say the alcohol is sharp. I don't think so. It is well hidden, for 11.2%. The appearance is what I would expect, dark with lots of sediment. A nice sticky head that sticks with it. Mmmm, the sediment is an added treat IMO. Smell is wonderful, I get raisins, bread, dark currents, and something else I can never quite put my finger on. Taste is fantastic! I like to pour it cold and let it sit for awhile before I taste it. Then I sip on it as it warms, letting my palette really warm up with it. If you tried this cold, then tried another one warm, it is completely different. I prefer it somewhere in the middle. The mouthfeel is good as well, kind of chewy but not too thick. Drinkability is also good, but I would never dream of slamming it. This is one to be savored. Probably in my top 5 favorite beers. 1,219 charactershopstorm, Oct 27, 2010
4.5/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 511.2 oz bottle with a freshness date of February 03, 2015, poured into a 25 oz snifter on October 26, 2010.
Appearance 4/5
Clear mahogany brown with dark sediment at the bottom, this ale pours with a big light tan colored head; the head retention is average, and lacing minimal.
Aroma 4/5
Dark fruit, sweetness, sharp alcohol, fresh baked dessert, perhaps chocolate? Too much alcohol at warmer temperature that distracts at times, but never gets solventy.
Taste 4.5/5
The taste is poetry when the beer gets warm, and warm is the best temperature for this one: beginnings are humble, just slightly sweet and fairly easy on the palate. It's towards the end when it turns massive, or should I say sublime? Vinous tannic astringency makes its presence felt and leaves raisin-ous notes on the palate, while chocolate and toffee like flavors take over the nose, and stay all along the warm, long finish that is never cloying. Some toastily malty notes in the aftertaste, and sweetness on the lips. Cold as this beverage is at room temperature, the impression is of a warm dessert after a satisfying meal.
Mouthfeel 5/5
The body is medium, but its presence immense.
Drinkability 5/5
In general I take alcohol into account while rating drinkability but for Belgian ales I make exceptions. I feel greedy for this one, what else can I say?
Other
This beer might make me revisit Chimay Blue and Trois Pistoles, that I rated lower, but I can clearly see how they were similar in character, if not at par in merit. 1,507 characterstewaris, Oct 26, 2010
4.51/5  rDev +0.9%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4A - Pours a murky brown with no head. Quite a bit of sediment at the end of the pour.
S - Sweet with scents of yeast, malt, clove, dark fruits, and autumn spices. 
M - Full, bready, thick, syrupy, sticky, a little bubbly on the tongue, and sticky. A little warm.
T - Tastes a lot like it smells. Sweet with a taste of dark sugars. Kind of like dark rum. Dark fruits like raisins. A little spicey with some clove. 
D - This is a fantastic beer and the only think would keep me from drinking it too often is the 11.3%. 520 charactersjlmarshall, Oct 26, 2010
4.84/5  rDev +8.3%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5A - Deep murky chocolate in color with fluffy 1inch tan head. Maybe I wasn't careful enough in handling this one, but there is plenty of chunky white yeast floating around.
S - Dark red grapes and port wine are the first things that come to mind. There are other fruits that make an appearance too - dark cherries and plums. There is also a distinct sharp alcohol note that reminds you this is going to be a powerful beer.
T - The sweet Belgian candi balances perfectly with rich red grapes, dark cherries and raisins. There is also a bit of a toasted toffee and caramel from the malts that I wasn't expecting. This is a fantastic beer. The flavors are so deep and rich. It's hard to imagine that this is an 11.3% beer.
M - Medium body with just enough carbonation to keep things interesting.
This is definitely the best of the Rochefort series, and a fantastic example of a Belgian Quad. This beer is so deep and rich! The beer was a little pricey, so I think this will be an every now and then type beer, but I'm sure glad that I had the opportunity to drink this one. 1,074 charactersjlandis, Oct 25, 2010
4.48/5  rDev +0.2%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Had the pleasure of sharing this with CTSparky while homebrewing.
A - This pours a caramel brown into a snifter. After a minute or so the color darkens to an intense brown. There is some lacing and active foam.
S - Smells like the candied fruit you get around the holidays. Very complex; candied cherries, oranges, and plum. Wow!
T - Malty and a sweet caramel with notes of fruit. The finish has a little burn of brandy but it is done extremely well. 
M - Done really well. Not too syrupy and not to light. A perfect sipper.
D - You could actually have more than one, but sharing a bottle was plenty. This is probably the best Quad ever. And surprisingly the price is not outrageous. I'm keeping another to see if some age makes this even better. 751 characterssocon67, Oct 25, 2010

Taste: Very complex and very tasty. Fruit dipped in caramel-but not too sweet. Some spiciness. Sweet bread. A little citrus tang at the finish.
Drinkability: Strong, but no boozy taste and goes down really easy. Not super expensive.
After having some New Glarus Abt, I wanted to get a Trappist Quad to compare it against. Rochefort knocked this out of the park. Absolutely delicious stuff that is easy to drink despite being a strong beer. Awesome! 568 charactersMdog, Oct 24, 2010
4.15/5  rDev -7.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5330mL bottle poured into a Westmalle chalice. Bottle dated 270514 so this beer is 17 months old. Drank at the same time as a 6 and 8.
It pours a deep murky mahogany. A cappuccino colored head tops the beer and lingers throughout the whole drink.
The nose is mostly plum and alcohol. The alcohol isn't harsh but definatly present
Taste has some raisins, coupled with some sweet sweet malt. Classic Belgian yeast character, even though it finishes pretty dry it still seems sweet on the back end. A conundrium if there is one but it has happened in this beer. Alcohol is present as it warms from fridge temp but not too harsh as for me to downgrade it.
Absolutely great mouthfeel just what i want from a quad. Carbonation helps the drinkability a lot and for a beer of it's strength it's highly drinkable to the point where I can see myself getting in trouble if I had a few of these in a night. 897 charactersweatherdog, Oct 20, 2010
4.39/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3Oh my, new Man-Eating Tree vinvly shows up from Finland, new song and video from Dreaming Dead pops up in the fB feed, and this gets opened...I'm in for something special. The bottle had to be carefully opened to preserve the carbonation and head as it wanted to spill out. Pours a super-cloudy mahogany, head was huge and quickly dissipated into a tiny hint of a rim. Excellent carbonation still. Enormous, complex and robust aromas: caramel, vanilla, brown sugar. Smells very sweet...Awesome so far. Flavor is...it's unimaginably rich. Initial burst is sweet, but well balanced by the carbonation. The sweetness of the malt wants to overpower you, but is quickly subdued by the carbonation. This beer is like the fight between Inigo Montoya and The Dread Pirate Roberts from "The Princess Bride": two masters competing with each other for dominance, with the malt barely winning out in the end, but agreeing that he met a master of nearly equal capacity. The flavor evolves through a cavalcade of briefly met opponents - fig, brown sugar, even maybe some overripe black cherry peeking his head out for a brief instant but returning to hiding in light of the malt's prowess. The finish sees the ultimate foe - alcohol - rear it's head but, although noticeable and potent (11.3% ABV - whoa), can't defeat malt's intricate skill. Fantastic, and painfully expensive ($6.49/11.2oz. bottle), beer that has to be tried to be believed. A touch below some others like Bernardus ABT 12, but still world class and a must try.
What I like most: The malt power and massive ABV (which feels like it's even higher than stated)
What I like least: The price and alcohol heat at the finish.
Verdict: Powerful and wonderful beer - a must try and worth every ludicrous penny. 1,760 charactersSolomonGrundy, Oct 19, 2010

4.4/5  rDev -1.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4I've had this beer a number of times, and every time I do, it has been long enough for me to forget two things: one, that is absolutely scrumptious, and two, the yeasties in this beast are strong. I'll leave the rest for you to read between the lines on that one.
Appearance: Swampy dark brown-gold-red with the occasional yeast chunk flying about. No matter how delicate the pour, I always seem to end up with some in the glass. No matter, as it lends itself perfectly to that true Belgian Quad style: heavy, mythical, and occasionally chunky. Laces very well, and has a zealous little tan head that grows on the pour.
Smell: Really a fantastic example of everything right with Quads. Earthy, dark fruits with a rum-like booziness to it. Anise, black-strap molasses, and Trappist yeast all have their say as well before it's all finished. Rich, fruity, and dark. Inviting.
Taste: Rum-raisin, fig, bread, licorice, booze, and slight sweetness, finishing with a powerful final grape-licorice pull on the aftertaste. As it warms up (and it does get better as it warms), the sweetness does tend to make its way through a bit more, but stops short of cloying. It holds its own against Abt 12 for certain, but falls just short of Westy 12. If I had to rank those as top threes, this would probably be third, but only by thismuch to the Abt 12. And that is saying something, as I love both of those beers.
Mouthfeel: Full, rich, and slightly boozy. Not overly dry, but maybe just a touch of too much carbonation. That may just be me splitting hairs at the end of the glass, but such a flavorful beer, while needing carbonation, also needs to be able to shine in the body just a tad more. Again, splitting hairs. But when compared to its other two world-class Quads, it is just a tad below.
Drinkability: Tasty, for sure, but every time I drink it, I am satisfied exactly where it finished. I wouldn't crave much more. I've never had this beer on tap, but I'd love the chance, as I've found Abt 12 to be consistently better on tap. This beer may be no exception. Definitely a very tasty Quad, and while the Westy reigns supreme, this is definitely not a huge step down in quality. 2,178 charactersnomomentwasted, Oct 18, 2010

I'd highly recommend this one. 272 charactersjoesc230, Oct 18, 2010
4.45/5  rDev -0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Poured into my St. Bernardus chalice. 1 Finger of head that dissipates quickly leaving a faint film on top. Murky brown, near black, very similar to a light coffee color. Khaki head. 
Smell starts with a rich, mild roasted malt. Fruit from the get go. Prunes/plum smells coming through strongly. Bit of sweet chocolate. Dried fruit is the predominant smell that shines through though. Alcohol comes through at the end, giving the smell of rum soaked raisins. Delicious.
Touch of malt hits front, with a tart roasted character, followed immediately by raisins/plums. Smooths out with a grassy/herbal hop character. Very mellow through the finish, though you get a nice alcohol warming. Definitely a sipper, though each sip is as magical and complex as the last. Avoid the yeast, as it mellows out the flavor rather than add anything new.
Mild carbonation, great mouth feel. Kinda tingly on the tongue, though not from the carbonation. the flavors resonate well after the swallow.
For 11.2%, this thing is dang drinkable. You definitely get a nice warming effect from the beer and it is well worth tracking down one. 1,118 charactersCheesemoose, Oct 17, 2010

Best before date of 14/04/2014 
A- Opaque raisin hued pour. Finger width light tan head that settles to a quarter inch ring around the top. Very faint carbonation bubbles rising to the top. Lacing is great.
S- This thing smells like toast! It's amazing how that aspect alone just impresses the hell out of me. belgian spices and yeast. Figs and prunes. Sweet toasted malts make this also have a cooked marshmellow presence. Alcohol is there but very well hidden.
T- Sweet figs and plums, brown sugar, vanilla. Alcohol is little more present but not overpowering or off putting. Toasted malts and yeast and spices.
M- Medium to full bodied, chewy. Alcohol warming on the way down.
D- Very smooth and enjoyable. One bottle was enough for now. Very interested to see what some time will do to this bad boy! 845 characterskorguy123, Oct 17, 2010

A- Dark cola brown with a big tan head that has great retention. Tons of thick, creamy lace.
S- Burnt brown sugar, strong raisins and good old caramel malt. Huge loaf of bread comes through with great yeast notes.
T- Similar to the nose. Dark raisin fruit, stale caramel malt (nice way), vanilla. Alcohol comes into play (which I have noticed everytime with this beer) but adds to the experience. Brown sugar makes it feel a bit like rum, tons of bread again.
MF- Crisp creamy body with low end carbonation allowing the flavors to shine. Certainly warm from the alcohol.
DB- A classic of the beer world, I think almost anyone would agree. I prefer 2006 Pannepot over this for Quads but this is still a very good beer. 811 characterscbutova, Oct 17, 2010

**EDIT - I have had several bottles of this lately of various vintages, and have concluded that it is truly an exceptional beer. As such, I have changed both the taste and overall scores to a 5 to reflect my thoughts.** 
A - Pours a rich, murky mahogany brown with a nice one finger tan/khaki head that slowly recedes to a slight lacing of the same color.
S - Dark sugary fruits right up front. There are raisins, figs, dates, prunes, and a slight cherry note as well. The aroma of brown sugar and malt really tie everything together nicely. Also getting some slight caramel or molasses like aromas. 
T - Dark, sticky fruits right up front like in the nose. Raisins, dates, figs, and brown sugar make up the rest of the flavor profile. The malt and candi sugar are there which really brings this one home. There is also a slight bubble gum like taste to this which is really nice. Quite complex and wonderful flavors.
M - Smooth, creamy and a nice, moderate carbonation. Very nice and rich on the palate.
D - Overall this is a great beer. The alcohol is disguised quite well which makes it very easy to drink. This is without a doubt my favorite Belgian beer and absolutely my favorite Quad. Those monks sure do know what they're doing! 1,330 charactersKAP1356, Oct 16, 2010

Dated:211014, I am going to assume that is a 5 year date stamp and say this was bottled in 09. Poured into a chalice. 
Appearance- Pours a deep brown with a two finger light khaki head. Fades to a thin layer a top the beer with some spotty lace. When held to the light some faint ruby highlights. 
Smell- Dark fruits (plum, grape, cherry). A brown sugary sweetness with some caramel and chocolate notes. A subtle earthyness as well. This even smells complex, I can't wait to put this inside me!
Taste- Getting the fruit notes right up front on the palate. Getting a black licorice taste from this to. The earthy malt characteristics really shine on the back end. This is 11%? Could have fooled me. Alcohol goes virtually unnoticed.
Mouthfeel- Medium body and carbonation. Goes down smooth, highly drinkable.
Overall- Glad I finally got around to trying this one. It did not disapoint. I am really starting to appreciate Quads. 950 charactersJLeege, Oct 16, 2010

A: Pours the darkest color before you reach pure blackness. No light coming through. A gorgeous fluffy off white head of three fingers that clings tightly to the glass. 
S: Tons and tons of dark sticky fruit. Rum soaked raisins, dates and prunes. Brown sugar and molasses. Belgian yeast and some anise. 
T: Initial chocolate gives way to some grape bubble gum. The finish has a light coffee componant. 
M: Typical beautiful Belgian mouthfeel. Pillowy soft with tongue tingling carbonation. Not much alcohol presence. 
Overall: I kinda figured this would be an amazing beer and it didn't disappoint. Doesn't crack my top 10 but this is definitely great beer! 681 charactersBigMike, Oct 16, 2010

Very strong sweet caramel notes coming from the smell, belgian yeasts. The caramel is there, but not nearly as strong in the taste. slight burn from the alcohol is there as well, but nothing terribly overpowering. Very nice malt taste as well. There is a lot going on here. The mouthfeel is great. It feels thicker but light at the same time, slips down the throat with some zip on the tongue. feels like a party in my mouth. This is a very drinkable beer especially given the ABV. I like this beer. I'm glad I tried it and will rate it highly because it is crafted with as much artisanal skill as any beer I've ever had. That said, it's not going to be a go to beer for me, but rather a once in a while treat and not one I would have more than one or two (if I had a 750) of in one night. 882 charactersBlanco, Oct 12, 2010

4.68/5  rDev +4.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5A - Unfiltered deep mahogany brown with a dense/creamy very light tan head. Lots of lacing and can see some carbonation on the sides up the glass.
S - Still a little cold but lots of phenols (candied dates, raisin, plum, dark fruit). A little medicinal, slight sour yeast funk. Pretty complex
T - Wow, flavors all over the place. Big plum sweetness, figs, candied sugar, dark sweet bread. Uber complex and wonderful.
M/D - Medium heavy body with a sweet finish. Very lightly carbonated and has a velvet-like texture. Waaay too easy to drink and the complexity of the flavor begs for another sip.
I now see why this beer is in the top 10. 641 charactersVaTechHopHead, Oct 10, 2010
4.63/5  rDev +3.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5This is a relatively young bottle, given the date printed on the front, so I was interested to see how it compared with the more aged tastings I've normally seen for TR10.
Poured a rich rich brown held up to light, with glints of amber and flashes of garnet. In the glass it's nearly opaque, with a big frothy thick tan head, which left very little lacing on my glass--a credit either to the alcohol or the condensation, as I'm pouring it right from the fridge.
The aroma hit me with 1) figs 2) rum 3) alcohol...though the alcohol smell was so distant and well-masked I would've believed this thing was 8%. Other smells are in there as well, subtle and enticing: malts and sugary sweetness. Really can't wait to sip.
And so I sip. The nose didn't lie; I'm tasting dark fruits in all their sweetness and glory. Given the age of this bottle, I'm also not surprised that the booziness is showing through a bit. It hardly detracts--it feels like sipping Port or Calvados. Do they even put hops in this brew? This is figgymaltsugarbooze heaven.
The bubbles are as fine as champagne and feel just slightly effervescent, contributing to a rich and decadent mouthfeel. It's perfect. The substantial yeast adds another texture element.
This thing is so complex, so well-made, so perfect for aging and enjoying for years. It's the kind of beer you don't fully appreciate until you've sampled hundreds of lesser breeds (this Bud's for you) and realize you've arrived at the pinnacle of a style.
I want another. 1,505 charactersykncornelius, Oct 08, 2010
4.47/5  rDev 0%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Appearance: dark mahogany brown, some head develops but quickly dissipates to a crown and some bubbles, slight haze
Aroma: richly fruity and sweet, deep notes of prunes and clovey spice, quite phenolicy, also an usual guava scent
Flavor: a lovely full maltiness with a rum-raisiny undercarriage, fairly sweet initially, then the peppery alcohol takes over, then a pleasant hop bitterness, finish is semi-sweet w/ a pruney aftertaste and some residual bitterness, very complex
Mouthfeel: full bodied, terse carbonation, blooming alcohol warmth w/out burning
Overall Impression: What a great beer! The flavor just BLOOMS in your senses. Also has a wonderful cognac-like essence. Rochefort is truly one of the best Trappist breweries. World class! 748 charactersbigdonniebrasco, Oct 08, 2010

A: Dark brown with a small frothy, tan head. Quite cloudy with plenty of sediment at the bottom of the glass; this was a turn off. Lacing throughout with the bubbles creeping up.
S: This smells like sweet fruit and malts.
T: The various dark fruits are noticeable from the get-go. This brew has a very complex flavor; I taste raisins, figs, candied sugar, chocolate malt, and some spices as well. A warming aftertaste lingers after each sip.
M: Full feel, yet smooth. Almost ideal.
D: This is too hot for me. The alcohol is barely hidden at all. One is enough for me.
This pales in comparison to St. Bernardus 12, but is still an excellent brew. 762 charactersDunkle, Oct 04, 2010
4.7/5  rDev +5.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Well, I'm drinking them in a lot of Bruges' Pubs, like the Estaminet or 't Risico, they are usually one of the most expensive beers on the beer menu, with prices being average op 4,50 euro a bottle. 
L: "she's got the looks..."
S: Malt, fruit, some candy, smells like a plate of buttermilk filled with 2 big spoons of brown sugar. Childhood memory! 
T: Sweet, and I love sweet, reminds me of some barrel proof rum, and the taste has also notes of that delicious plate of buttermilk with 2 big spoons of brown sugar! Yes, just incredibly good! Dark fruit, raisins. Plums. And of course the caramel comes back once in a while... this would pair very good with a ramon allones specially selected, or a por larranaga petit corona. First one has a honey tone, last one a good caramel taste... 
F: Feels great, a bit thick, but I love that. 
All round: my favourite beer at the moment, that I refuse to drink all weekend long, just too good in hiding the ABV... 
I'm drinking my first Westy 12 in 2 days... I hope it can rival... 1,029 charactersyapi, Oct 04, 2010
4.35/5  rDev -2.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4For the style, it's an amazing looking beer; never seen a Belgian so dark. It's very dark brown sitting under a huge tan head with good staying power. No light is coming thru this drink and there appears to be some particulates suspended in the beer.
Again, for the style, I've not smelled anything like it. It's got a champagne-like scent early on, but as it warms, notes of chocolate and malt come thru. There seems to be a smokiness smell as well.
There's a trend here, I've had no Belgian like this before. It has a chocolatey, cola taste to it. Spices are present, but subdued, mostly pepper.
Mouthfeel is complex. It's sweet at the start and the sweetness stays throughout. In the finish you'll pick up some bite from the spice and that last part of the swallow brings a hint of warmth from the alcohol. Nothing is overpower, it's just enough to let you know it's there.
For as strong as the beer is, 11.3% ABV, it's very drinkable. Having said that, the alcohol is present, but hides in the background while you're swimming in all the flavors. It's noticeable, but only slightly. The only thing preventing me from having another is I know the alcohol is too much, and the cost. Everyone must try this at least once. 1,226 charactersRickS95, Oct 04, 2010

T - Upon tasting this sets off a variety of different flavors with a definite sweetness. This all culminates into an amazing beer which doesn't taste as dark as it looks. You can taste the alcohol but seems to be more like a 7.5% than an 11.3%. 
Notes - This beer is absolutely amazing. 397 charactersccahoon22, Oct 02, 2010

Smell is alcohol and fruit; lemon and spice.
The magical belgian flavors at the forefront. Fruit in there as well, apples, lemon. Lots of heat. I'll have to re-review this because I think I got an 'off' bottle. Taste is not quite up to par with what I remember. 
Solid mouthfeel.
I'll come back to this one soon as either there was something wrong with me that night or the beer. Hopefully. 454 charactersptykozoon, Oct 02, 2010
4.08/5  rDev -8.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Well, the flood waters in my basement subsided. Might as well pull out a little something special.
Appearance: Poured from the bottle, this brew is a deep, dark, almost black, mahogany brown. I'm not quite able to pour the whole bottle into my chalice as the frothy, foamy head almost overflows out the top of the glass. The massive amount of foam rapidly fades to about a half inch worth of tan goodness where it sort of stop and hangs around for a bit. Perfect time to pour in the rest of the bottle, and as I do so I can see a wee bit of sediment flow into the glass.
Smell: Boozy, with plenty of rich, ripe, dark candied fruit and just the slightest hint of chocolate and nuts. I would love to rate this brew higher here, but the booziness does take away from the brew IMHO.
Taste: Not as boozy as I thought it would be given the nose. Sure, the ABV is there, but not as bad as I thought. Taste has plenty of raisins and cherries, with a nice subtle hint of chocolate. Potent, but very tasty.
Mouthfeel: Full bodied, syrupy, and just the right amount of carbonation. A big beer for sure.
Drinkability: As far as Quads go, this one is really really good. Lots of big flavor, but with a high ABV and strong boozy characteristic I doubt I could enjoy more than one or two of these in an entire evening. That being said, I'm certainly going to enjoy the one I've got, and I'd definitely recommend this brew to anybody. 1,423 characterskrisandajt, Oct 01, 2010
4.44/5  rDev -0.7%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Superb Trappist ale (no, this is not entirely redundant), although I have a slight preference for Rochefort 8. Revisited (with Westy 12) in March 2016.?
A - Pours a deep, dark brown, with a fine tan head. 
D - would score a perfect 5 but for the high and detectable alcohol content. 
S - caramel, malts, slight alcohol, spices
M - effervescent
T - high alcohol content is fairly well-hidden but remains readily noticeable. 427 characterschinchill, Oct 01, 2010
4.48/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Making my way back through Belgians I haven't tried or tried in a long while. Have read and heard great things about the "Big 3" - Westvleteren, Rochefort and St. Bernadus and realized I hadn't tried any of them yet. This after literally claiming to be a Belgian drinker for over 15 years. (Yeah, I know)
First up is the one I can get here easily. I found the Rochefort 10 at Market District in Pgh. (supermarket).
Poured into a Chimay goblet (I really need some new glassware)
A: Small foam, dissipates quickly. Almost no lacing. Tiny bubbles. Extremely promising color and appearance.
S: Outstanding. I usually fluff this aspect off. But this smell is intoxicating of itself. Figs, Middle-Earth. I need to let it sit to bring the temp up and I don't know if I can stand it. 
T: Amazing. How did I miss this one all this time? Slightly sweet (which I love), strong taste of currants, figs, rum-raisin maybe? Molasses. Plum?
M: Slightly syrupy and mid-heavy. Feels more like food than beer. It's like some sort of middle-ages fruitcake in a glass. In a good way. 
D: Very drinkable. Almost too much so. But the alcohol feel is prominent, as it should be at 11.3% I probably would stick to just one of these at a sitting. 
Overall - blown away. And not just by the beer, but by my own negligence. We used to try a lot of Belgians every week and thought we had made it through the big guns long ago. I couldn't remember trying Orval either and had one last night and was disappointed. It made me feel like maybe I really did try these all years ago and hadn't gone back for a reason. But this is a superb beer that ranks among my favorites of all time, and just solidifies that it's the quads that I love.
Seeking older samples and putting 4 of these in the cellar for later. 1,782 charactersradioscooter, Oct 01, 2010
4.37/5  rDev -2.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 2.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5High hopes for this guy from resident beer nerd's nerdiness. Pours nearly opaque, a deep brown, with an impressive tan head (it took a few pours to get the whole bottle into the chalice). The foam settles eventually but leaves a thick coating along the side when it is drank. It smells subtle... actually, I can't smell much at all. A bit of mustiness, like old books, but that's even reaching a bit. No smell really to speak of, which worried me... (edited: letting it sit for a bit more, it gave up some cherry/prune/yeasty scent, but still not much and not impressive. 2.5)
Okay. This was essentially a revelation, especially when side-by-side next to Ommegang Three Philosophers, but... oh my. Such rich creamy dark flavors-- cola and brown sugar dominating. It's insanely deceptive with its alcohol content-- I get a brief splash of alcohol at the back of my tongue when swallowing it, but that's about it. This tastes decadent and wonderful and why can't more Quads be like this?
More, please. Thank you. 1,012 charactersfragilemacabre, Sep 30, 2010

Pours an opaque, murky brown with red highlight color. Fluffy tight tiny bubbled 1 finger head that coasters. Sweet smelling with aromas of fruit, especially dark cherry and plum. The taste is very good, sweet, but good. Nice medium creamy mouthfeel. The taste is a very nice blend of subtle spice, plum, raisins, and dark fruit. I get a lingering caramel flavor as well. Very solid overall, nice and clean. Subtle hint of alcohol is present throughout. 553 characterskbutler1, Sep 29, 2010
4.76/5  rDev +6.5%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Appearance- very very dark brown to black with very thick tan head thats bellows up nicely off the pour, with close inspection you can see plenty of bubbles slowly streaming, a perfect look,
Smell- dark chocolate is the dominating smell very nice, malty rich nose,
Taste- very very rich flavor, very rich malts with very strong chocolate tones almost reminiscent of a chocolate milk, this beer maintains a great a balance more then alot others of the style in that its not super sweet and its not the alcohol thats keeping it in check, alcohol is very faint overall in this, its there but its not dominant at all, just extremely complex and rich in flavor with long finish really great flavor profile,
Mouthfeel- luscious smooth and complex, just very almost heavy while still in way being easy to get down, just really rich feel
Drinkability- what can i say about this beer that already hasnt been said, its definitely one of the best beers i have ever tasted before, its right up there to me with saint bernardus abt. 12 as my favorite beer to this point in any style, i couldnt tell you right off hand which is better with out direct side by side comparison but im having this one now so it tastes the best lol, this is a treat and one everyone should try, its rich complex and a long lingering treat to slowly sip and savor, while i know i can get more im gonna probably go stock up for the holidays, hard for beers to get much better then this, just perfection in the world of beer 1,490 charactersStunner97, Sep 29, 2010
4.59/5  rDev +2.7%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured into RR Tulip
Pour: Deep/murky/woody brown. Head came and went. Good carbonation
Nose: Robust palate of flavors. Chocolate, bourbon, cherry, peet moss, coffee, caramel and brown sugar
Taste: Complex layers of flavor. Sweet caramel and toffee in the beginning, moved slowly into moss, currants, black pepper, old oak, molasses, bourbon, scotch, coffee and chocolate cherries.
This was highly impacting on the senses. Full of complexity and subtlety that begs to be explored. One down side was the heat of the beer. More pronounced in the finished, it was definitely a subtle ode to the 11.3% ABV.
I would absolutely have this again. An over all winner in my book. 674 characterstvandragt, Sep 29, 2010
5/5  rDev +11.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5330ml bottle poured into a Maudite tulip.
Pours a dark brown, similar to a cola color while it produced a tall 3 finger light tan head, which took a while to dissipate. Has fantastic lacing. Smells of of grapes and raisin, reminded me of a red wine in some ways. Very malty and fruity, tasting raisin, fig and grapes - very sweet. Alcohol level was warming and just perfect. Feels nothing like 11.3% and is extremely smooth. I intended to drink this slowly and pair with a sharp cheddar but after the first sip, I chose to drink it alone. I liked this so much, I drank it more quickly than intended, leaving me wanting more but not having another bottle readily available. This beer is perfect to me and deserving of my first perfect score. 741 charactersVaison, Sep 27, 2010
3.94/5  rDev -11.9%look: 3 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Tasted from bottle purchased at Famous Lombard. Pours a muddy amber brown with a fizzy but thick white head that recedes to lace on the outside of the glass. Nose is sweet dried fruites (raisin, fig, prune) with caramelized malt and light citrus. The alcohol is definitely present on the nose. The flavors are not quite as dark, with the malt and yeast taking over. The fruits are a little more acidic, and much juicier, not as dried, on the palate. The plum flavor really comes through. The body is full with light, but somewhat stinging carbonation and a long fruity and burning finish. It is easy to understand why this beer is as highly rated as it is. 656 characterswedgie9, Sep 27, 2010
4.67/5  rDev +4.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A - A deep garnet color, saw the sediment coming out of the bottle, and I could have stopped it, but I didn't because I often like the texture it gives in the mouth.
S - The smell is sultry, rich and deep. There's a bit of a dark fruit sweetness and just a taint of alcohol.
T - Syrupy malt character with an intense sweetness. The high ABV keeps it volatile on the tongue. It's a quadrupel but tastes a bit like some of the US made bourbon-barrel aged barleywines.
M - More carbonated than I'd have thought, very heavy in the mouth but the alcohol keeps it moving .The sediment is never settles out enough to change the gradation of the mouthfeel throughout the drink, it's more the warming which brings out the alcohol that changes the mouthfeel as you drink it.
D - This beer is like soufle or crème brulee, way too much for an everyday affair but if you don't have one every now and again you'll probably die. Take this beer seriously or it will end you! 963 charactersrjhaupt, Sep 27, 2010
4.22/5  rDev -5.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4This beer is excellent, although it's a bit strongly sweet and heavy and I don't think it comes up to the astoundingly wonderful quality of their #8.
Very dark red-brown, it has a smallish tan head steadily shrinking to a foamy ring and some wisps, only a very little weak foamy lace.
Aroma is rich dark raisiny-sweet bread, port, wood, hint of doughy cinnamon rolls, sweet fruit, some iron.
Taste is sweet-spicey, a lot of spicey-sweet fruit, rich brown bread with hint of cinnamon rolls, dark raisin and port, with iron and mineral joining in the finish and after taste, faint hints of oreo cookies and wood. It has an excellent, full, rich feel with some faintly medicinal-tingly character and feel. It's excellent, has a rich, strong character with some complexity, but it is a little too thick, heavy-duty and sweet and fails to achieve the incredible balance and complexity of character that the #8 does. Then again, I suppose that that is part of the nature of this beer, so much higher in alcohol, and for the alcohol, the character and drinkability are really very high. 1,082 charactersOffa, Sep 26, 2010
4.66/5  rDev +4.3%look: 3 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Appearance: Slightly murky coca cola brown with a light beige head of fine bubbles. Slightly sloppy pour resulted in a 2+ finger head. Some yeast chunks visible.
Smell: Grape/raisin with faint aroma of prunes with a slight toffee scent. It could be my car freshener any day.
Taste: Grape/raisin with faint taste of prunes with a slight toffee/caramel taste. Mild cinnamon spice taste with slight hops coming through on the finish.
Mouthfeel: Lively sparking wine type carbonation and a medium body equals a satisfying mouthful for me.
Drinkability: For me personally I'd have never guessed the ABV at 11+%. It would be way too easy to get in over my head if too many bottles were available.
I prefer malt-based beers. I love sours and picked up a Supplication with my Trappistes Rochefort 10. I really like Supplication but I'm fighting the urge to exchange the Supplication and get two more of these. A fine example of what exemplary brewing techniques can produce without a bunch of wild ingredients. 1,007 charactersIKR, Sep 25, 2010
4.01/5  rDev -10.3%look: 3 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Considered at this moment the 6th best beer on the planet by the best beer community on the planet. This is something else right here. I'm kinda nervous to crack this bad boy open. ;) Here we go!
Dark, bitter, depressive feces brown appearance that's quite average in it's appeal. Some may say otherwise. The head starts strong, and disappears at a moderate rate that leaves a skim of foam which remains for quite a while. I'm about 15 minutes in, half way finished, and there's still a light head; my favorite aspect to the appearance. But what's with the floating chunks? As I poured it, the last bit...didn't stream out but plopped out...like a shit. Who wouldn't think that's gross? Beers don't plop, shit does. Of course I researched it and realized that it's quite common. But seeing the chunks and debris of yeast floating around is a rather questionable sight for noobs like myself. 
Easily the most aromatic beer I've come across. Well, let me rephrase that; it's the most pleasant aroma from a beer I've come across. That's better. More than anything else, I notice the fruity fragrance. I'm not quite good enough for specifics as to which fruit is the most dominant, but this right here is a fruity smelling beer that truly only delivers swell nasal kisses. Even the belches had after-wards are heavenly and worthy of sharing with others. 
Mind you, I'm not the biggest beer connoisseur so my opinion should be more appreciated by comparable people. The taste is nice, strong, and also slightly intimidating in it's strength as the boozy feel packs a wallop. There is also a lingering spicy, cinnamon-y aftertaste and smell. If you're not a fan of cinnamon or that cupboard spice taste...you may have issues here.
Slight sting when held for taste; has a mouth wash feel. It's refreshing, but entirely noticeable that can set back a person who owns a sensitive palette. The remnants are happily not rude, and your mouth will only have a feel of taste, instead of a dark, debris infested liquid. As I said in the previous paragraph the taste and smell will linger as the beer will remain with you. It's all about preference at this point. 
This is a beer that is high on the ABV% with 11.3, and quite strong with it's personality. But it's also friendly, fruity, spice-filled and pretty thin. It's a totally drinkable beer to unwind to, appreciate and share with other beer lovers. A beautiful beer to have with meals that will keep the laughs and love flowing. 2,475 charactersElijahCSkuggs, Sep 25, 2010

4.2/5  rDev -6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Appearance -- Pours a murky dark brown with a slim spongy beige head and what appears to be cinnamon floating atop.
Smell -- Prune, red grape, cinnamon and nutmeg, a little bit buttery.
Taste -- Dark fruits at the fore: prunes, raisins, and figs. Pear and crisp green apple are also present, but to a much lesser extent. Lots of spice in this one, specifically cinnamon, anise, clove, and black pepper. A spiced rum richness is also present. Finish is quite spicy with cinnamon, black pepper, and a hint of alcohol bite. Overall, the alcohol is frighteningly well-hidden.
Mouthfeel -- Medium to full in body, coats the mouth. Carbonation is bubbly, fluffy and mild. Very satisfying.
Drinkability -- For the style, this is about as drinkable as it gets. Very satisfying. This is the kind of beer I want to kick back with after an awful day at work. A very nice quad.

4.67/5  rDev +4.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Ah, here we go. Finally getting around to trying one of the more highly regarded Quads out there. Let's see if it lives up to the hype!
A - Pours a deep, dark brown color with nice, tan colored head that gives way to a thick, bubbly lacing. Visible yeast chunks can be seen floating around. This beer means business.
S - Very strong dark fruit notes! I'm detecting plums, cherries, prunes, and even a bit of apple (ok, not a dark fruit, but it's there!), as well as a red-wine like scent. Amidst all this complexity is molasses, brown sugar, belgian yeast/candi, and a bit of alcohol (to be expected at 11.3% though). This is one of the most complex smelling beers I've come across.
T - So many flavors, where do I begin? The flavor profile is very much similar to the smell. Bready malts with notes of molasses, brown sugar, yeast, spices, and candi, with lots of fruity overtones, namely plum, cherry, grape, and some red-wine characteristics. This quad is quite big on the fruit flavors, almost bordering into Strong Dark Ale territory (but then again, the two styles are somewhat similar). Alcohol is amazingly well hidden, given the strength is approaching wine territory. I've had 9% beers that can't hide the alcohol this well.
M - This is one area I was expecting to be big and full bodied. It's actually more along the lines of a medium body. Carbonation is very light, and the overall feel is bubbly. Overall, I like a bit more body, and creamier feel in my Quads/BSDA's, but this is still excellent.
D - Way too easy to drink for 11.3%. Savor and sip this one. I'm only knocking a point off due to ABV, and price ($7.59 per bottle).
Overall - I'm going to have to have some St.Bernardus Abt 12 and Chimay Blue again to decide which my favorite Belgian ale is again, but this is one of the top picks for sure. Then again, one thing I love about Quads and BSDA's is the wide range of flavors and interpretations out there. You can try two different examples of the style, and they may both taste pretty different. But enough rambling! If you're a big quad fan, and have some extra dinero laying around, this is a must-seek. 2,138 charactersFlightoficarus, Sep 22, 2010
4.82/5  rDev +7.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured into a Rochefort chalice.
One of those beers that I've had so many times, but never thought to write up a review. Here we go, from notes and memory.
Appearance: Dark brown in color with a pillowy head with tightly packed bubbles. There is some sediment present in this beer, which I choose to leave in the bottle.
Nose: Smells of brown sugar, dark fruits, figs and raisins. For me, this beer has a very appealing nose to it, however, it can be a bit boozey. 
Taste: Wowza, what can I say. This is one of my favorite beers. Smooth, sweet ... tastes of the brown sugar that was hinted at in the nose. Absolutely delicious. Raisins, molasses ... there is a lot going on in this beer! The taste of alcohol can be detected, but it's still a very smooth, sippable brew. 
Mouth: Not overly hearty, but very smooth. The the right amount of carbonation is present.
Drinkability: Very drinkable, although, I generally keep it at one per session ... it packs a punch. 969 charactersmrunseen, Sep 21, 2010
5/5  rDev +11.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured from bottle to Rochefort glass.
A: Just like the 6 and 8, the appearance on this one lives up to the quad. Very dark, molasses in color.
S: Very sweet smelling. Like making caramels, the sugar melting. Love it.
T: I get so much from the Rocheforts. This one is a strong caramel and slight hits of fig. Nice sweetness without being too overwhelming; perhaps my favorite of the three.
M: Slight carbonation on my tongue, but very smooth. All the flavors come together nicely and make this an exceptional beer.
D: Have to be careful with this one, it tastes so good that you can't really tell (at least me) that it's ABV is so high.
The quad's are perhaps my favorite style of beer and this ranks up with the best of them. Would recommend this to anyone and it's becoming extremely easy to find. Usually in the $5 to $7.50 per bottle range in most of southern Illinois and Paducah, KY. 895 characterscdrogers, Sep 20, 2010
4.67/5  rDev +4.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A- Poured into my Snifter dark brown, woody in colour. Somewhat Cloudy. Nice creamy head with Decent Lacing. Thick look to it as it poured but it did not pour thick which was unexpected.
S- Earthy, very natural smell to it. Can really pick up the malts they smell very roasted. Very Dark caramel, almost sweet hints with some Vanilla. Can pick up the hops in the back as well they smell very floral. Very Enjoyable
T- Wow, so much flavour in one drink. Very sweet taste to it. The Malt flavour is so wonderful, very roasted but not overpowering at all. The Dark Caramel flavour comes out here very much, but the flavour is perfectly balanced with the hops. They are full of flavour here, floral and earthy with very little bitterness. As I drink flavours of dried fruits (Raisins, Apricots) comes through. Very nice to detect very little Yeast flavour. As the drink warms I can also taste alcohol is isn't surprising cause it's 11.3%. Also as it warms a nice bitterness becomes prevalent which compliments the sweetness it started with very well.
M- Very very smooth and creamy. Wonderful to swirl around and let it sit in my mouth. The warming from the alcohol is also very invited and makes the whole experience very different, but I like it.
D- I love this beer. Way different than what I was expecting so that was nice. Everything about this beer seems to compliment it. The sweet and bitter, the colour, smell. Everything is in balance with the beer. As it warms the feeling changes to going from the sweet to the bitter and warming more and more. One of the best beer experiences I've had as of yet. 1,609 characterscase4816, Sep 20, 2010
4.6/5  rDev +2.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Poured from a 330ml bottle into a clear pint glass. Paid $7.99 at Capital Market. This is the highest priced (per ounce) beer I have bought.
A-Pours a hazy mahogany-amber hue with a three finger, beige head with good retention, but only scant lacing. The hiss from thousands (well, too many to count) of tiny bubbles popping as the head receded to a thin cap sounded like soda pop. I have never observed this from a beer.
S-Fruity, malty, sweet, and sour (in a pleasant way - from the yeast I suspect). Nice aroma is dominated by dark dried fruits like raisins, figs, and dates. Fruitier than sweet.
T-Prominent flavors include brown sugar, black cherries, rum-soaked raisins, and toasted toffee malts. Best enjoyed by sipping and rolling this around the tongue and mouth before swallowing. All of this leads to a long-lived spicy, cloves finish. Taste is also fruitier than sweet. This is outstanding.
M-Very smooth for 11.3% ABV. Carbonation level is spot on.
D-Drinkability is awesome for a beer this big. I was prejudiced because of the hype. But, my only regret is there only remain a couple more sips in my glass and no more bottles in the fridge. Rated slightly lower due to cost. 1,192 charactersvelosuds, Sep 19, 2010
4/5  rDev -10.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5This beer pours a slightly cloudy brown color that is reminiscent of cola (lots of ruby highlighting.) However, it's got some haziness and some bigger yeast chunks floating around. Creamy tan head fades rather quickly other than around the edges where it lasts quite some time. The smell is pretty sweet dominated by dark fruits. There's raisins, dates, brown sugar, chocolate, pears, banana, and spice. Lots of sweetness once it hits your mouth along with a warming alcohol. There's some sweet breadiness as well as a molasses component. The raisins and dates also make a reappearance in the taste. Mouthfeel was slightly different than expected. Although it was creamy, there was a bit thinner feel at first. The creaminess then wiped this out. I'd enjoy a little less carbonation. Only my personal taste, but there are other quads out there I've like better. 861 charactersalkemy, Sep 18, 2010
4.71/5  rDev +5.4%look: 3 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5A: This beer has a blackish-brown body with red highlights. The head is a creamy texture, ivory in color, and about 1/2 finger. Very little to no lacing, but it's definitely mostly lasting. Visible carbonation.
S: A sugary sweet aroma mixed with dark fruits (raisins) & nuts. Reminds me very much of a port except there is a small hint of Belgian yeast.
T: An amazing and complex flavor of dark fruits (dates, raisins, apricots), candy sugar, and rich creamy malts. No hops are detected and the flavor is very similar to a port which hides the high ABV well.
M: A big and creamy mouthfeel with a silky smooth texture. Medium body (my husband thinks it's med-full) witl light carbonation.
D: LOVE LOVE LOVE this beer. Will definitely be drinking this again! 760 charactersBrewCrew2010, Sep 17, 2010
3.38/5  rDev -24.4%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3 |  overall: 3The appearance of this is a harbinger of the taste -- very dark but not "thick-looking", with a thin but intense-looking head.
Smell and taste are largely synonymous, the expected dark fruit, raisins, no real yeast, and of course, extremely boozy. It doesn't even seem to make an attempt to hide the alcohol, and that dominates the taste. It's maybe a little more dry than sweet, but basically somewhere in between.
Not bad, but I think highly overrated. If you like quads you'll like this, but it doesn't seem a particularly great beer.
To summarize: Meh. 559 characterssnogglethorpe, Sep 17, 2010
4.7/5  rDev +5.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Appearance: Poured an inviting deep muddy brown with hues of amber and ruby. A large cap of khaki-colored foam which lingers leaving nice lacing.
Smell: Yeasty and nutty like toasted pecans with a nice assortment of candied fruits. Plums, raisins, apricots. Very nice but a bit too subtle.
Taste: Wow. Ripe plums, raisins, dates. Yeasty bread. Slight peppery notes. Subtle sweetness like molasses throughout. Even a hint of smoke. Slight warming alcohol. Thick and complex but so smooth it's a pure delight.
Mouthfeel: Phenomenal. Full, creamy, thick, smooth. It's obvious that great care was taken in crafting the mouthfeel. Perfectly carbonated to deliver the flavor.
Drinkability: Exceptionally deceptive in it's delivery of 11% ABV. Very very good. 756 charactersJackieTH, Sep 16, 2010
4.42/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a bottle into my Chimay goblet.
Pours a dark, dark almost opaque brown, with a creamy tan head that dissipates rapidly, leaving a bit of lacing coating the inside of the glass. As always, there's also quite a bit of that Belgian yeast gunk hanging out down at the bottom, but that's to be expected. Smell is phenomenal. Full of dried fruits and malts, with a slight hint of alcohol. Very appealing. 
The initial sip is full of malts and a figgy kind of breadiness that permeates the entire drinking experience. More flavors quickly make themselves known, including a hint of brown sugar and caramel, followed by some raisins and dates. Towards the end, a mild bitterness shows up, and the 11.3% ABV makes an appearance in the form of some alcoholic warming. Neither are obtrusive, however, making the taste all the more enjoyable. The entire palate of flavors lingers into the aftertaste, which is really impressive. Mouthfeel is smooth, though it does seem quite a bit more carbonated than the Rochefort 8. Medium-bodied and substantial, it really feels pleasing on the tongue.
At 11.3% ABV and a small serving size, you've really got to pace yourself when drinking this. It's damn tasty and easily quaffable. The booziness becomes a bit more pronounced as you let it warm, so it's definitely a sipper. Another beer that absolutely deserves all the accolades it gets. 1,383 charactersr0nyn, Sep 16, 2010

Very smooth yet very tasty with a taste of fruit dark and thick. Alcohol content on the higher side yet blends nicely with the fruit and content 289 characterssbegraft, Sep 14, 2010
4.49/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Pours a dark dark brown, with hints of dark amber, and red. The head is offwhite, and starts out quite large but settles down to a thin layer on top. 
The aroma is very appealing. Very fruity, I can smell raisin, plum, apricot, and candied sugar, as well as some of the traditional belgian yeast smell.
The taste has many of the same elements as the smell, but with more breadiness, and more of a prominent yeast flavour. Loads of dark fruits like raisin, dates, and figs in the flavour. The beer almost has a port quality to it. The alcohol is noticeable in this beer, but it is not unpleasant (refer to portwine quality). 
The beer has a great mouthfeel, quite creamy, but the carbonation is sufficient so the beer does not feel flat.
Not difficult to drink, but at 11.3 abv, this is not a beer you would want to be pouring back in any great quantity. 857 charactersQuestionableScum, Sep 12, 2010
4.17/5  rDev -6.7%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Had the 8 last night, 10 tonight. Deep brown with ruby highlights, light tan head that fades to a ring around my chalice. Smells like candied dried fruit and toasted pecans plus rasins, plums, dark candy sugar and special b malt. Kinda sweet and complex, definatly fruity and rich with many specialty malts adding complexity. Alot of flavors here from the yeast. Slightly spicy but alot more round than the 8. 
Really big mouthfeel, rich, thick, perfect carb. Wow, for such a big beer the alcohol is well hidden, but it is a little cloying so I'm gonna dock it half a point. 574 characterspmlondrigan, Sep 12, 2010
4.21/5  rDev -5.8%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours with a large, ultra creamy, beige head covering a murky brown body. Thick lacing and good retention; this is what a beer should look like. Aroma is floral with rich fruits, currants and sweetness, but the aroma isn't very strong/pungent. Alcohol is noticeable in the taste, aftertaste is salty and yeasty. Dark fruits abound. A solid beer. 345 charactersBMan1113VR, Sep 09, 2010
4.02/5  rDev -10.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Aroma is very rich. Dark fruit, plums, brown sugar, molasses....oh, and alcohol. It's a very boozy and deep aroma.
The initial taste I get is of sweet dark fruit...raisins....even some grapes. This is followed by a very thick brown sugar/molasses taste that goes through the body and into the finish. The high ABV is certainly noticeable on the finish, but could certainly be worse considering what the ABV is. It does cause a bit of astringency on the swallow, though. Some sweetness hangs around after the swallow, but all in all seems pretty dry. 550 charactersNODAK, Sep 09, 2010
4.23/5  rDev -5.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Sometimes it's tough to review a legendary beer after you have not had it in awhile. Questions like: Tastes change over time, and what if I don't like it? are very commonplace - at least in my mind. Anyway, I picked this up over at the Arlington Whole Foods today because...it was there.
I poured this into a sniffer.
A: Dark brown, muddy water pour, that adds up to this beautiful fully cabonated (almost champagne-like), dark brew that has the foamiest head I've seen in a long time - unfiltered obviously.
S: VERY subdued, but equally pleasant. I was expecting this big flood of dark fruit to start beating me up (like Raison d'Etre), but much to my amazement - no. Sure, I'm getting the fruit, but I smell chocolate.
T: Sweet licorice right off the bat, then dates. VERY sweet. I actually think age will mellow this out. Not many fancy spices at all - just good old fashioned malts and sugars. Earthy and then some!
M: Creamy as hell, with the intense sweetness being part of the brew's charm. Lots of foamy lacing on the glass.
D: 11.2 fl. oz. was plenty. Because the stuff has an ABV of 11.3, I'm feeling pretty good! 1,129 charactersChaney, Sep 09, 2010

You have to savor this for the huge cost, and you want to for the huge taste.
Extremely sweet smelling and sugary, but this does not represent the much more balanced taste. Thick mouthfeel and deep taste, just pure delight. And you can not mess with it for the huge 11.3 abv, while you could never detect that. A powerhouse. 342 characterssellmeagod, Sep 05, 2010

Poured from a 330 ml bottle into a snifter. Bottle no. was 290414.
Pours a cloudy dark mahogany. Has a tan head that catches flecks of dark yeast. The thick, sweet head sticks to the sides as I swirl the glass.
Sweet smelling, with raisins and other dried fruit smells predominating over darker hints of toffee and roasted malt.
Taste is bold, warm and sweet with currant, blackberry and dark raisin tastes. Malty, slightly yeasty, and complex. Extremely smooth in taste, almost like a liquer.
Mouthfeel is full and smooth. 
This one had intimidated me for a while, but now that I've had it, I intend to get this again. Very sippable, like a desert rather than something to be consumed. 760 charactersTheHoppiest, Sep 05, 2010

4.82/5  rDev +7.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from 330 ml bottle, no intentional aging here. Bought it the same week I drank it (and I would like to try it aged sometime.) I tasted part of it at around 40° and then let most of the glass warm up ten or fifteen degrees for the rest.
Appearance: Nice, dark, chocolate body. A pretty light tan head. Fairly thick and hazy. Little bits of red orange colors the edges, and the foam persists throughout the glass.
Smell: Malty, with some phenol to it, some dark fruit notes -- fig, plum, cherry -- but the dark malty notes also bring out out candied sugar and real dessert flavors. Chocolate, I think.
Taste: Out of this world, really incredible. Those dark candied sugars, and then a fruit following it up. It's more complex than I can hope to describe here. It dries up a little with some herbal and anise like flavors in there. This is fairly sweet, and as such for me, I like it after a meal, almost like a dessert.
Mouthfeel: This is malty and big, but it really is nicely crisp once you consider the sheer size of the thing. I never once felt like I was drinking beer syrup.
Drinkability: It's alcohol and size make splitting a small bottle appropriate, but this is a beer I want to sip over a long time. It's as drinkable as it should be. 1,256 charactersphilosobeer, Sep 03, 2010
3.98/5  rDev -11%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Very dark brown slightly amber colored pour. Nice dense foamy tan head that dissipates somewhat quickly leaving little lacing around the glass.
Aroma is strong - lots of dark fruity notes with a little bit of funk and some alcohol. Flavor is HUGE. More dark fruits, some slight caramel, malts and booze. Very complex with lots going on here.
Very nice and bubbly mouthfeel for such a dark and hugely flavorful beer. The alcohol content makes you want to sip it, but the carbonation and overall feel make it easy to drink too fast. My advice - take you time and enjoy this one; its a great beer.

A.
A nic dark brown. almost to the point of black. a nice foamy head, similar to a root beer. some sediment can be seen going into the glass from the bottle but I kinda like that. A nice raw authentic beer. 
S.
Amazing. Almost like a nice port. I can smell the malts and dark fruits. almost like raisins or cherries. the booze smell is prevalent but should be expected w/ an alcohol content as this.
T.
again, like a fine port. the first initial kiss of booze, but a nice fruity taste w/ brown sugar. this is my first Trappist beer so nothing what I was expecting. taste more like a fine port than a beer.
M.
velvety smooth. not watery like a guinness. feels like a good quality stout in your mouth.
D.
definitely an amazing beer. a little high in the % of alcohol so one is about all one could savor before getting some numb taste buds. 872 characterscetherid, Aug 29, 2010

A: Brown sugar, caramel, dark fruit. No hop aromatics. Belgian Yeast.
F: Flavor mimmicks the aroma...brown sugar, caramel malt, dark fruit, raisin, canteloupe, pancake syrup (not quite maple, but not aunt jemimah) . No hop character. 
M: Medium Bodied and mouthfeel, medium-high carb. No warmth. Finishes dry and velvety smooth. 
O: IMO, this is a perfect Quad. The one that all quads should be compared to. Yes, that means beating out westy 12. I think that westy finishes light in body, where as rochefort 10 has the body and viscosity representing the style, but of course, open to beer geek interpretation. 688 charactersadkirkish, Aug 28, 2010

A - Dark ruby color to this beer which yields a very thick tan colored head that is 2-3 fingers thick. Plenty of spider lacing around my tulip glass with a few yeast particles on board.
S - dark fruits, candied sugar, sweet yeast and a malty spicy aroma are all present. The smell of freshly baked bread is in the air as well. 
T - Front end flavor of sweet malt and peppery spice followed by a candy brown sugar flavor with bananas, cloves and nutmeg spice. There is a distinct bready yeast presence throughout the taste. There is also a unique complexity to this beer which gets even more intense as the beer warms up. A hint of citrus flavors are also present. 
M - I would characterize this beer as having a medium body with moderate carbonation and a fizzy mouth feel. There is a very creamy and earthy texture to this beer which is quite pleasant. The alcohol is very well hidden especially for an 11.30% abv. 
D - A very tightly flavored trappist quad that provides a very rich and complex flavor profile which is dangerously drinkable. Fantastic beer overall! 1,113 charactersracer2k, Aug 27, 2010

M- Is very full from the mash. Thick but smooth in texture. Very filling.
D- I must say not all Trappistes are equal this is distinct from others. As it should but this beer is bringing another area I'm not familiar yet and dying to figure out. This is goto relax drink if you feeel like not being cheap on the pocket.

T: Huge dark berries, and a nice yeast kick. There is some good malt, caramel and roasted flavors in the back, but they are quite subtle. A little bit of booze in the flavor, but in general it is fairly well masked.

A- three fingers of dense light tan head from a steady pour that settles slowly to a few spots of lace, a good ring, and a skin on top. Ruddy dark brown in color with a good amount of haze. Touches of golden orange at the edges. 
S- brown sugar and dark stone fruit. Dates and plums with the abbey yeast fruitiness. Dark malts and a hint of chocolate and spice. 
T- sweet and spice out front with candy and brown sugar, cloves and nutmeg. A blanket of abbey yeast coats the combined flavors bringing out a complex fruit character. Dark bread and fig jam. Hints of anise and orange peel. 
M- medium bodied and beautifully carbed with tiny refreshing bubbles that leave you with an almost creamy mouth feel. No heat at all for the 11 plus abv. 
D- its a classic for a reason I haven't found an trappist ale I didn't like but this one comes close to the top. Richly flavored and complex, yet easy like an everyday drinker. Right up my alley. 981 charactersoglmcdgl, Aug 26, 2010
4.72/5  rDev +5.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Pours the deepest of dark mahogany with a thick foamy almond colored head. Thickness of the head fades pretty quickly into a nice 1cm thick cap on the body. 
Aroma is simply amazing. Fruity with a bit of a solvent-like character from the alcohol. Raisins and apples covered in brown sugar would seems to best describe the fruit. 
First sip matches right up with the aroma. Sweet, alcoholic, and a bit of spice. The malt makes it self know with lots of sugar and fruit. The alcohol provides a wonderful warming character without being overbearing. 
Mouthfeel is full but smooth and creamy. A decent amount of carbonation makes this beer feel almost alive as it passes from the glass to my mouth. 
Well, there is a reason this beer is in the Top 10 on this site. Complex, bold, and Amazing. These monks are onto something here. 829 charactersKinsman, Aug 25, 2010

Appearance: Deep, murky brown with a decent amount of sediment floating around the glass. Absolutely no light penetrates this glass at all. Big frothy, uncontrollable head on the first pour. Let it settle before another pour.
Aroma: Brown sugar, molasses and spiced rum in the nose. The booze really comes through big time, much more than I expected. Maybe even a bit of sour vinegar mixed in here too.
Taste: Raisons, molasses, caramel, brown sugar and some doughiness all in really good balance. So sweet and very balanced. The ABV is hidden so much better here than in the aroma. Extremely pleasant to sip, with a nice warming after ech sip.
Mouthfeel: Smooth and full bodied. Not much carbonation, but perfectly suited to sipping over thse course of half an hour.
Drinkability: The ABV is not too noticable in the taste, but can get a bit out of hand in the aroma. The flavors work perfectly for a beer to sip and enjoy.
Overall, I like this beer a lot and really enjoyed sipping on it. An extremely flavorful quad. Definitely worth to pick up and sip on and the flavors really did grow on me throughout the glass. 1,232 charactersGosox8787, Aug 21, 2010

3.85/5  rDev -13.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.511.2 oz bottle drank from a chimay chalice. the best by date is about a year from now, making this one 2 years old (i think).
A- this one pours out a murky dark brown colored body with some reddish highlights when held near a light source. a moderate sized beige head forms on top and takes its time receding. lots of thick lacing left behind. 
S- lots of belgian yeast is the first thing i notice, but im not getting the typical fruits from it this time. banana, pear, and apples mostly. a little bit of darker fruits like raisin, date, and fig as well. somewhat strong alcohol presence. brown sugar adds a sweet factor to all this.
T- the brown sugar i could smell comes through loud and clear. the banana, clove, and pear from the yeast didnt go away. the darker fruits are still here and more pronounced. the alcohol is very present. 
M- thin bodied. almost watery. what i would expect from the style. some serious warming from the booze.
D- easy enough to finish this tiny bottle. i dont think i like this one as much as i like the 8. still havnt tried the 6...i should get on that. 1,092 charactersjwinship83, Aug 20, 2010
3.95/5  rDev -11.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.5A-Dark brown with sediment pieces floating around. Tan head; not huge.
S-Molasses, dried plums, raison, brown sugar. Malty.
T-Like the nose but better. Syrupy brown sugan and those darn dried fruity flavors. Booze is evident but expected.
M-Drinks like a stout. Booze says hello in every sip. 
D-Its 11.3% alcohol so I won't be asking for more than one bottle. Yet, for the percentage, it is drinkable.
Quads aren't my specialty but I can tell this one's pretty good. I don't love the style however this one will please most everyone. 539 charactersVelvetExtract, Aug 20, 2010
4.63/5  rDev +3.6%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5This is my favorite beer. Sadly I doubt anything I could say would do it justice. An amazing dark beer with an alcohol flavor that is easily drinkable. Great sipping and social beer that I wouldn't recommend chugging down like water. Last time I tried chugging these down I woke up with a hangover in the bathroom floor with remorse for spending $9 a beer. Pours nearly black with a nice creamy head most of the time. I smell raisins and alcohol in it most times. Sometimes I get a fig smell. 9 times out of 10 I end up with yeast in my glass when I pour it but I enjoy the yeast. I keep at least two of these around at all times. 630 charactersjthor018, Aug 20, 2010

Appearance: Pours a dark brown with a nice head that maintains and laces nicely throughout the entire drink. 
Smell: Candied fruits, Belgian yeast, molasses, some leather and a great bready aroma. 
Taste: Great taste of candied fruits, sugar, molasses, Belgian yeast, doughy malt. 
Mouthfeel: Amazingly creamy and smooth. Feels great in the mouth. 
Drinkability: With everyday availability, this is a steal at what I can pick it up for. World class and a true treat. Will be stocking up on this. 548 charactersAxic10, Aug 19, 2010
4.57/5  rDev +2.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Pours a very dark and murky brown that is almost black. When held up to my desk lamp, rich ruby can be seen around the edges, but the center might as well be an abyss. The head is light tan in color, extremely creamy and has wonderful retention and lacing. On closer inspection, the lacing appears to shimmer. What's with that? The aroma is an incredible mix of raisin, fruit leather, molasses, tart cherries, chocolate, and clove. There is so much going on that every time I take a sniff it is like I pick out something different. One smell that that I do find myself searching for is alcohol. It seems to be almost completely hidden in the aroma. I take a sip and the complex flavors cascade over my tongue. Once again, dark dried fruits seem to be center stage, but are quickly followed by burnt and flavorful dark sugar. Spice notes of clove and star anise also enter the mix. There is also a wonderful leathery earthiness in the flavor that gives this brew a real old world sort of charm. The alcohol is more present in the flavor, but seriously, this thing hides its ABV very well. The mouthfeel is on the heavier side of medium and has a nice smoothness and a long, but delicate finish. I am not a huge fan of quads, as they tend to be a little bit hot, but this is like a steel fist in a velvet glove. It's a sipper, but goes down easily for style and is quite enjoyable. This is a must try beer. Period. 1,412 characterszoso1967, Aug 16, 2010
1.7/5  rDev -62%look: 2 | smell: 2 | taste: 1.5 | feel: 3 |  overall: 1Fr. Ian and I decided that since I had obtained a Westy 12 from megriggs in Germany, why not buy a St. Bernardus Abt 12 and this one to see what the #1, 6 and 11 beers in the world and the #1, 2, and 3 Quads were all about.
We started with this one. 
Served at 55 degrees into tulip glasses.
A: Very strong pop of the top. Dirty brown color, yeasty, cloudy. Decent head formation and retention, but not pleasant to look at due to the cloud of yeast in the beer that does not seem to want to settle out.
S: Funky. It is the least complex and most yeast-funk smell I have ever come across.
T: Horrible. Doesn't really even taste like beer. It is as if someone siphoned off the yeast cake and put in into flat cola and bottled it. 
M: The good level of carbonation keeps this from being a slime on your tongue.
D: I had to force Fr. Ian to finish his. 
I would not take another of these if you gave it to me. Biggest waste of $7 ever. I sure hope the other two work out better... 984 charactersSpica66, Aug 13, 2010
4.84/5  rDev +8.3%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Appearance: Poured from an 11.2oz bottle into a large wine glass. Color is a dark brown, with hints of ruby around the edges. Nice creamy, one-finger head with good retention. Not a lot clinging to the sides of the glass, but there is a beautiful, creamy layer on top that never seems to go away. Some yeasty chunks at the bottom, per usual.
Smell: Heaven in my nostrils. One of the most complex aromas my nose has had the pleasure of perceiving. Spicy yeast, dark fruits, chocolate, licorice, and a touch of alcohol are up front. There is also some toasted malt and that bread-like character I enjoyed so much in the Rochefort 8.
Taste: I am immediately greeted with a paradoxical cross between the biting and the smooth. The alcohol warms sufficiently, but rides along with tingling carbonation and spicy yeast flavors. Nice malt presence; figs, plumb, molasses, brown sugar, and toffee vie for your attention. After the flavors subside, you're left with a lovely warming sensation, reminiscent of a good glass of bourbon.
Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied, very smooth, and creamy. Honestly, just about perfect.
Drinkability: Probably more of a sipper with the alcohol content and all, but this beer makes me want to keep on sipping.
If I was stranded on a desert island and could only bring one beer, I would choose this one. 1,325 charactersBuckyFresh, Aug 13, 2010

Poured into mt Duvel tulip the beer is dark chestnut brown. Huge beige head towers a solid three fingers. Small cap tiny soapy lace ring.
The aroma is sweet caramel and toffee. Loads of honey drizzled dark fruits. Roast nuts, cinnamon and yeasty bread. 
The flavor is very bready. Plums, dates, raisin and other dark fruits. Lots of spices. Caramel and roast malt. The booze is present but not overly hot. 
Medium to full creamy body. Lots of carbonation.
Overall a true legend of a beer. All praise is warranted for sure. 627 charactersbeerwolf77, Aug 11, 2010
4.72/5  rDev +5.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5My original review from 11-08-2006 is pretty embarrassing, so I'm re-ticking this one.
It pours a dark and turbid brown. Once in the glass it's completely opaque, topped by a light beige head that retains well.
This one smells great - rich toffee, caramelized figs, fruitcake, spices and a faint medicinal/botanical character that's very fitting.
Lush and velvety on the tongue, almost creamy, the mouthfeel is incredible. There's a lot of depth to the flavor, with an emphasis on rich caramelized malt, black licorice, dates, earthy figs, spiced cake. It drinks entirely too easy for a beer over 11% ABV, and there's barely a trace of heat. The finish is mild but lingering, spicy and semi-dry, almost vinous.
This is every bit as good to me now as it was 4 years ago, a true classic. 789 characterslargadeer, Aug 10, 2010
4.57/5  rDev +2.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Roughly year old bottle poured into a fluted chalice glass. Muddy light brown head over a dark red/brown beer and looks very rich.
The smell of Rocheforte 10 is arguably its best trait. Complex aroma of dried cherry, raisin, fig, along with a bit of leather and banana. The leather fades to background as it the beer warms up, letting more of the fig dominate the smell. 
Tastes exactly like it smells, slightly sweet, but with the alcohol present to allow the aromas to translate directly to your tongue. Each sip is slightly different, like a large bowl of mixed fruits for desert.
A beer that you can really sit down and enjoy slowly. 640 charactersnataku00, Aug 10, 2010
4.16/5  rDev -6.9%look: 4 | smell: 3 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5A: Very dark brown-black with some orange as it pours and reflecting under the edges of the glass. Poured with one finger of a tan head that slowly dissipates to a white layer of foam.
S: There isn't a lot of scent, but definitely has that Belgian yeast scent and maltiness.
T: There is a warm round feeling when drinking this, and my guess would be it is from the 11.3% ABV. It tastes lightly malty with some tinges of that familiar Belgian flavor on the roof of the mouth. As soon as it hits the mouth it confuses the palate which is a good thing. It is not bitter and does not have much of an aftertaste. I could taste the hops by pushing it to the tip of my tongue.
M: As mentioned, it feels warm and round. A sip will occupy all corners of your mouth and the alcohol quickly numbs the tongue for lingering too long. It is silky but does not coat the mouth.
D: It is completely drinkable. This is a high ABV beer that doesn't have any extreme flavors that might be off-putting to any one particular fan of a beer style. It is a beer that a person could drink more than once, simply to pick out new found flavors. 1,120 charactersteromous, Aug 10, 2010

Banana bread, dark fruits, cloves, caramel, brown sugar, and rum.

Smell of doughy bread, biscuit malt, belgian yeast, more dough and some dough. caramel also hanging out with must - not the egyptian kind though. 
Taste of Dough , bread and toasted biscuits. There is plenty of caramel and yellow plum to go around. Some booze flavors definitely present as expected at 11.3% and some cloves with sourdough bread. If I could type dough again without regretting it I probably would...

S-Beautiful,ripe plum,date,tobacco and Nebbiolo grapes with some roasted caramel malt and a unique earthiness.

First of all it was a beautiful dark brown coffee like pour with a one inch head that stood there for a long time, I let the beer sit there for a little bit. There were a big off wite lace.
The smell I got hints of raisins, some chocolate (the again my nose isn't very experienced on this), the taste was kind of sweet with the presence of the raisins, a little bit nutty, alcohol was very present in the taste (that's the only thing that threw me off a little bit) then again it's a 11.4% ABV, I got also some carbonation feel.
I would have again (but in fall or winter, it was a little bit hot yersterday, lol) 648 charactersarturorg, Aug 01, 2010
4.88/5  rDev +9.2%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Served in- A bottle poured into a snifter
Appearance- Dark, almost near-black appearance. Somewhere in between the colors of dark and milk chocolate. The beer is perfectly carbonated with a nice white head, which goes in great contrast with the dark beer.
Smell- I got hints of caramel when I smelled it. The aroma of the high alcohol is definitely present.
Taste- To go along with the smell, there are notes of caramel. This goes along great with the sweet malty taste that accompanies it. The taste of the alcohol isn't present initially but the after-taste has a slight kick to it.
Mouthfeel- This is one of the smoothest beers I have ever tasted. From the beginning of the sip all the way to the end, it's like black velvet in my mouth.
Drinkability- If I had the option, and the wallet, to drink this beer all night I, without a doubt, would. It's smooth feel and sweet, but not to sweet, taste makes me able to drink many more of these. The only problem, the relatively high alcohol content is the only reason I can think of not to order another, 1,057 charactersdgm6689, Jul 31, 2010

33cl into a tulip. Pours a rich deep brown. Head retention is minor, lacing unexceptional.
Aroma of a quad, a superb quad, say no more.
Taste is big and rich, sip this slow to ensure you enjoy all the subtle changes as it warms . . . . warms most excellent. Don't serve this with a meal, save it for after. The aftertaste of a premier quad is special and this sets the bar high. 
A measure of the best brews is how well their flavor evolves as they warm - is the range wide and always pleasing - does it continually improve, is the last sip like dessert of a fine meal in a tulip!
Bless you Monks of Abbaye Notre Dame de Saint Remy !
They summarize . . . . .men who leave everything behind to live with God and in that way open the eyes for the Resurrection of the Lord . . . . . . . and brew a fine beer

4.57/5  rDev +2.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4330ml bottle at Chancey Smith's. 
Pours a dark ruby brown with a creamy tan head that subsides to thin ring of fizz. Strands of lacing cling to the goblet. 
Smell and taste are a beautiful symmetry of vinous, port-like aromas, fruity Belgian yeast, blueberries, pie crust, plum, toffee candy, chocolate liqueur, currants, and an elegant, red grape sweetness with plenty of warmth going down. 
Mouthfeel is rich, full-bodied, syrupy, somewhat sugary (but not overly so), delicate spiciness, sticky and powdery dryness to finish. Soothing. 
Overall, Rochefort 10 is a gorgeous Trappist ale that compares to the best of them, including Westy 12. It's packed with complex flavours and literally glides across the tongue while drinking. Don't let the wider distribution fool you: this is a world class beer that's well worth the money. An exemplary quadrupel. 858 characterscratez, Jul 29, 2010

A - Holy shit...Very dark...It looks like little chunks are floating around in it. I cant give it a five because there is only one beer that gets a five
S - Smells like a fresh summer day. I don't know what that smell is but it is very unique. Almost a musty smell.
T - I don't know where to start. So I take a sip. Immediately I get smacked in the face by dark dried fruits. I try to fight back but immediately a Belgian yeast giant stomps on me. He starts to shoot poisonous clove and spicy yeast darks at me. Behind the giant is the might alcohol monster. It's there. It's staring at me. We both see each other but he just sits there and doesn't do anything. At first I'm confused why this alcohol monster is not attacking me like the rest but then I released that he is being held down by massive chains made of dark roasty malts and yeast. He has a mask over his head made of hops. So as I am being lit up by spicy yeast and hops I fall into this pool of dark mashed fruits and bananas. As I lye here I see the horrible alcohol beast and realized I have an arrow in my chest. I did not sense this at all. In fact I have no feeling at the point of entry. However I feel its affects. I look over at the massive beast and its holding a bow. I realize it has shot me. I did not see this coming at all. I spent all my time fighting against these other creatures and the alcohol beast got me in one shot...but I overcome this and begin to find the rest of these creatures. Since it is very dark it is hard to make out what some of these creatures are but they are there but they kind of blend together in a nice way. Overall this beer gave me an orgasm. I don't think I got any in the glass though. I am drinking this on my 21st birthday right before I run this town tonight...

4.33/5  rDev -3.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Appearance: Dark Brown with a certain red hue. Sediment floats around. The doesn't hang around too long, but when it's there it's vanilla and creamy. Makes you want to lose yourself.
Smell: Definitely smells of dark fruits such as raisins. For an abv of 11.3% it masks the alcohol relatively well. You can pick up on the alcohol, it's there to be sure, but not up in your face.
Taste: This is a powerful brew. It's extremely warming. Tastes.. very very complex. Dark fruits make for a sweet yet tart experience and the alcohol gives for a very manageable spicy undertone.
Mouthfeel: Has a great mouthfeel. It's fairly fullbodied and creamy. It has exceptional smoothness. The thing that gets me, and maybe this is an isolated incident, but as I swallow the drink dances on the back of my tongue in almost a spiraling upward motion. It's very unique and pleasing.
Drinkability: It's exceptional. Here's the thing, being at 11.3% abv it's obviously a sipping beer. It's complexity is worth taking it super slow, anyway. It's absolutely delicious so it's hard not to indulge yourself a little. 1,094 charactersBmuncy, Jul 26, 2010
4.33/5  rDev -3.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Pours an Extremely dark brownish-red color with a nice creme-vanilla color head. The scent is dark fruits, alcohol, and a whole lotta dark grapes. The taste is just crazy complex. I initially pick up candy sugars and caramel, followed by some tasty dark fruits (figs, grapes, plums, dates), then it's followed by some tasty yeast flavors. The Belgian yeast strands make the bread flavor really come through. And the alcohol warmness really comes through as the beer warms up a bit. The mouthfeel is very nice, but it tends to be a little watery...I thought this beer would be a little more full-bodied. It's hard to explain...because the taste of this beer is not watery at all, but the mouthfeel could be a bit more FULL (i guess). Drinkability is so scary...I cannot tell this is such a high ABV beer. 803 charactersDovaliHops, Jul 25, 2010

S: Sweet smell & I could sleep all night with this smell.
T: Grape, funky & sweet. Not overbearing and very mellow.

S: Good lord is this complex. Sweet and sour cherries, plums, Welch's grape juice. Very vinous in aroma. Great malt backbone to smooth it all out. Definitely leans toward the sweet fruits. Very lovely. Hard to hide the 12% abv, but they manage to quite well. Some heat. Almost thought this beer had soured upon smelling the bottle when opened, was greatly mistaken.
T: Sweet grapes, plums, cherries (both sweet and tart). This is a quad. Good alcohol burn that soothes the overlying sweetness. Not cloyingly sweet, I believe due to the tart cherries that come into play. A small amount of banana and some very muted tropical fruits as well. Unbelievably complex.
M: Couldn't wait to get to the mouthfeel. Most quads I've had have been super syrupy and overly malty. This beer combines a great balance between fruit sweetness and a thick, but well carbonated consistency. Fantastic.
D: Considering the consistency of this beer, compared to most heavy bodied quads, this is extraordinary. Carbonation is on point, good crispness for a quad again. God bless the Trappist breweries. 1,244 characterskiddynamite920, Jul 23, 2010

Pours dark brown, slight hint of ruby; thin off-white head that didn't stick around.
Chocolate and cherry aroma, with a good bit of cough syrup thrown in the mix along with vanilla.
Very rich and sweet, yet balanced well with a little bitter finish followed by a huge caramel aftertaste.
Extremely full bodied, light carb. A bit boozy, but I have no doubt that this would improve with age.

O - Incredibly drinkable and a fantastic accessible version of the style. Finished tied for 3rd with Westy 12 for me. 4/4.5/4/4.5/4.5 1,042 charactersChrisPro, Jul 21, 2010

A- Extremely dark brown with a thin tan head that dissipates quickly leaving a ring around the glass. It doesn't appear to have much carbonation. It leaves chunks of sedement in the bottom of the glass.
S- It smells of dark fruits and brown sugar with a hint of smoke and chocolate. 
T- It tastes of caramel, chocolate, brown sugar, plum, and black cherry with a hint of smoke. It's really too complex to figure out all the flavors.
M- Smooth and creamy with little carbonation.
D- I would rate this as very drinkable if you plan on sipping. Watch out for the ABV. 608 charactersBravo4, Jul 19, 2010

A - Dark brown pour with a solid cream head.
S - Smells sweet and sturdy. Some spice notes and malty goodness present.
T - Deep rich sweet malt and dark sugars shine through. Caramel, brown sugar, wood flavors detectable. Full flavored through the whole sip and glass. The alcohol does come through and gives a syrupy warming effect.
M - Full bodied beer with syrupy and warm feelings. Its strong but not too heavy, and its well balanced.
D - I agree its a sip and savour beer. Good complexity for sheer enjoyment.
Notes - This one is a quality beer. It has it all, looks, flavor, complexity, body. 634 charactersBeerForMuscle, Jul 18, 2010
4.8/5  rDev +7.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75330ml bottle into snifter.
A: Pours a deep mahogany red with a dollop of light brown velvet head that formed a dense film. Could be mistaken for stout. 
S: This has got to be one of the best beers I've ever smelled. Bourbon, vanilla, cream, raisins, black cherry, mahogany, cream, orange flavored Flinstones push-up pops, honeydew... did I mention cream? The alcohol just barely pokes through with some light vapor.
T: I'm almost scared to taste this. The smell intimidates me. Here it goes...
Complex is an understatement. Big notes of dark cherries, bourbon, and...cream! Notes of rum-soaked raisins, orange peel, vanilla, doughy yeast and syrupy alcohol.
M: The alcohol shows itself in the finish but isn't hot. Full bodied and creamy. Could use a little more carbonation, but glorious none the less.
D: Why did I wait so long to try this? Actually, I should have waited even long so that my palate could appreciate it more. Not a beer I could drink every day, but definitely one of the best beers I've had the pleasure of drinking. Buy this now.
EDIT:
Years later I am currently drinking a bottle that is just over 6 years old. I'm not getting any notes of cardboard or sherry. Very smooth and polished but still very sweet and potent. Alcohol is toned down and integrated.  Vanilla, raisin, grape, caramel and chocolate dominate, with Belgian sugar, brown sugar, and a touch of molasses in the finish. This beer has aged beautifully, and definitely better than most any other beer I've had this old or older, including American version of the style. Definitely one of the top beers on the planet, and the top three of the style. 1,635 charactersscottfrie, Jul 17, 2010

S: Aroma is mostly caramel and dark fruit; you can also detect the alcohol.
T: Rich flavor of sweet brown sugar, dark fruits, some warming booze (but not overwhelming). It's also kind of spicy and a little tart.
M: Medium bodied, smooth. The carbonation borders on being too aggressive on some sips but overall I like it.
D: It's delicious and I could sip on it all day if it weren't for the prohibitively high price and ABV. I'm going to be sure to pick up a few more bottles to cellar and compare to this fresher experience. 671 charactersdjhowell, Jul 17, 2010
4.73/5  rDev +5.8%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A - Dark brown chocolate. Thick head withers away quickly. While present, it appeared as though a dash of cinnamon had been sprinkled over it.
S - Transfixing. Fruity, insistent smell of alcohol hiding in the background, waiting to jump out and grab you.
T - Wow. I'm out of my league here. This is unbelievable. I don't quite have the range to describe this... Maybe raisins or other sugary sweet fruit. Caramel, perhaps. Intriguing experience.
M - Thick, heavy brew. Quick burst of carbonation, a brief sweetness on the tongue followed by a sensation of coating the entire mouth with a spicy alcohol flavor which lingers a while after swallowing.
D - Warming, best for a cold day, but I'm enjoying immensely. Will slowly savor each drop over the next hour. Wouldn't want this to pass by without pausing to appreciate the experience.
[After the hour passed: the taste intensified many times over as the quad warmed up. The alcohol taste was dominant by the end - quite powerful. One is more than enough! I look forward to another soon.] 1,042 charactersSwill5786, Jul 17, 2010
5/5  rDev +11.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This is quite possibly the best beer I have ever had in my life. If not for the steep price of this beer, I would probably not buy any other beers but this. This is a trappist beer, but is very different from most of the other trappist beers out there because it is exceptionally dark, and does not have the "wheaty" aftertaste associated with most belgiums. The beer pours very dark, and does contain sedement, with a cloudy dark appearance. The smell is a bit smoky, with intense caramel and chocolately tones. The taste is very, very smoothe for such a dark beer, with a very sweet finish, with a little touch of smokiness and bittering, but both working in accord with the heavy chocolate/caramel flavors. I have never drank more than 2 at one sitting due to the price point of this beer, but 2 will definitely put you in a stupor. Perfect beer to accompany a steak, chop, or shank. Would be the perfect beer if not for the price point! 940 charactersmcnkuckles, Jul 15, 2010

It poured an extremely dark brown with dark'ish head. Tons of lacing and head retention. The smell has lots of dried fruit - cherry and plum mostly - and a hint of sweet chocolate. Some brown sugar too. Flavour is just out of this world. Very nice carbonation level. If the Westy 12 really is better than this one, I can't wait to try it someday (I hope). 451 characterskwjd, Jul 15, 2010

A - Deep, dark, cloudy brown with lots of little "floaties". Small, creamy khaki head that disappears quickly.
S - Smells like a box of brown sugar or a dark molasses-y fruitcake. Tons of brandy notes, figs, dates, raisins. Slightly boozy.
T - Wow! Lots of dark dried fruits (dates, figs, prunes) and dark caramel. Sweet, but not cloying. Very complex but balanced, reminds me of a very fine rum. Amazing beer!
M - Lots of prickly little bubbles dance all around the tongue. Much smoother then the ABV would suggest, goes down so easily!
D - I could sip on this all night! I didn't know what to expect from this one, despite being on the Top 100 list. This is an incredible beer, I will definitely be picking up more of these. Can't wait to pair this with a dessert of some kind, just screams digestif to me. 843 charactersjsanford, Jul 13, 2010
4.75/5  rDev +6.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 52007 vintage that I opened at a tasting I had this weekend. This was a star of the show, and many beer drinkers and non-beer drinkers alike said how much they loved this. 
A reddish-brown liquid sits in my tasting glass. It's hazy and has a beautiful head that pillows and sticks around for a moment, then subsides and leaves good lace. Great looking beer!
Smell is dark fruit (raison, plum, fig) atop caramel malt that has some candy sugar notes as well. The best thing about this beer is the unique yeast. It has a spicy characteristic that makes the nose just kicked up enough, with pepper, clove, a touch of banana, and some pear. Overall, this smells just shy of perfection.
The taste is to die for. Seriously, the flavors are thick and beautiful. Figs and raisons are piled on toffee and caramel malt base. Some alcohol (but well masked) gives an impression of port wine, rum, and/or scotch. Not too boozy, though, great flavors. Sweet with just a touch of bitterness, this finishes with some esters from the yeast (pepper and bubblegum). Just perfect, gives the Westy12 a run for its money. A divine, world class tasting beer.
Body is medium to heavy, with great carbonation for the style. Well done, just not the "wow" I would give a 5 to.
I'd had it before a few times, but when I took the time to savor and examine it, I made a conclusion: I need to keep this on hand at all times, for it is perhaps one of the best beers in the world. 1,450 charactersjampics2, Jul 12, 2010
3.87/5  rDev -13.4%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5When opened, the bottle starts to bubble over...slowly, thank goodness. Pours with lots of clustered yeast chunks. Less of a head than the '8' or the '6'. It also dies to a single layer. Very cloudy brown. Some streaky lace.
Smells like a watered down brandy, meaning lots of warming alcohol for a beer. Otherwise, it smells like a freshly opened bag of brown sugar.
Highly carbonated, this beer is thick enough to handle it. My wife says it's like drinking chocolate mousse. The sweetness supports that comment--there are elements of chocolate. Lots of malted sugars. The swallow is more of the same but the alcohol is strangely muted. 638 characterssmcolw, Jul 12, 2010
4.8/5  rDev +7.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5This is the actually the first quad I've tasted, and, unable to get the #1 in the world, I've "settled" for the Rochefort 10.
A - Deep and dark. Looks like Coca-Cola. Head is big and stays for a while. Brown streaks from the sediment laced through the bubbles. A surprising amount of sediment hovering in the liquid - being a newbie, it's a little overwhelming.
S - Sweet and fruity, cinnamon and raisin notes. The alcohol stands out, but in a warm way.
T - An amazing complexity of flavor! Sweet and warming, with no bitterness. Caramely sweetness, fruits (plum and raisin are strong), a subtle streak of rummy spiciness. The alcohol blends in perfectly with the flavors, not overly strong or surprising - can't believe it's over 11%.
M - Very small bubbles. Rolls around on the tongue nicely. An amazing finish, sweet and clean. The alcohol lingers in the mouth warmly after the swallow with strong sugar and caramel notes.
D - Nothing about this beer is hard to drink. Such an accessible, warming, and wonderfully complex, flavorful beer. Definitely a sipper, but I could sip it all day. 1,095 characterstimonan, Jul 10, 2010
3.9/5  rDev -12.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 2.5 |  overall: 3.5As one of the most well-regarded beers in the world, this one stands proudly and confidently as a shining example of the style. Regarding its appearance, it is just dark. I will not call it black, but the browns and reds of this beer seem to hide within in an effort to avoid being labeled. The aroma and flavor certainly are not trying to hide, though. The aroma is packed with bold notes of plums, raisins, and yeast that are expected from the style. The flavor is likewise a bold combination of dark fruits that is easily the most potent of any of the quads or Belgian strong dark ales that I have tried. 
This boldness in both the flavor and aroma is impressive and enjoyable, but it comes at a bit of a cost, as the flavor starts getting quite sweet as the beer warms. In addition, in contrast to some other Belgian (and Belgian-style) beers, the texture is largely unremarkable and does not provide any relief from the sweet fruitiness of the flavor. Overall, this beer can serve as a benchmark against which the flavor of other quads and Belgian strong dark ales are compared, but the potency of flavors is just a bit too much, and this beer breaks down just short of excellence. 1,187 charactersdevilben02, Jul 08, 2010

S: Moderate nutty smell with spices mixed in, and a little bit of a sweet fruity smell. Slight whiff of alcohol, but not too much- great smelling beer.
T: Great sweet, fruity taste mixed with a nuty, spicy underlying flavor. It's a very good taste, but there's a little too much of an alcohol taste left on the tongue.
M: This is the best aspect of this beer, for me. The carbonation is perfect, floating in the mouth lightly and fizzing a bit. The flavor is not overwhelming in the mouth. Perfect.
D: For a quad, very good. But the alcohol aftertaste knocks it down for me a bit from the high standard set by its companion, westy. 745 characterspauljmccain, Jul 04, 2010
4.65/5  rDev +4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 33cL bottle into a beautiful Rochefort goblet.
A: So dark it looks like a stout. Even the head is light brown. The surface of the beer has odd spots of colour clumped around the edges and complex swirls throughout. Opaque, dense, and promising.
S: Alcohol, malty sugar, and dark fruits envelop you. Lighter fruits make an appearance as well, tickling the nose. This beer has an incredibly strong smell.
T: One of the best beers I've ever tasted. Sweet, dark fruit is borne forth on waves of alcoholic bliss. A spiciness fights a losing battle to emerge until the very end of the taste, after the fruit has faded into memory. A little heavy-handed with the fruit and generally single-minded, but everything it does is done to near perfection. Rochefort 10 tastes almost like liquor at points. Overall: wow. Incredibly impressed.
M: Sweet, at times *almost* too much, with a spicy kick and carbonation keeping things interesting.
D: An amazing beer, my favourite of the Rocheforts hands down, but too solidly alcholic and fruity for frequent drinking. One to sip and savour for a long, wonderful time.
EDIT: The following review is of a bottle aged in a friend's wine cellar for 14 months (and an additional month and a half sitting in my refrigerator).
Poured from a 33cL bottle into a Rochefort chalice. Best before 07 October 2014. Reviewed Christmas Day 2011.
4.5A: A loose but large head fills up a finger to the rim. Some dark, yeasty sediment floats on the top. Surprisingly retention. The beer is opaque from all angles, a pleasant mahogany, with some yeast clumps appearing near the bottom edges of the glass. The patches of light and dark remaining when the head has finally settled are gorgeous, reminiscent of a nice cappuccino. 
4S: Winey and subdued. Complex, phenolic fruit is quite captivating. Some richer, darker fruits in the distant background remind me that this is a hefty quad, but otherwise alcohol is all but absent.
5T/4.5M: Waves of flavour build into in a truly magnificent crescendo of sublimity. It's no Westvleteren 12, but otherwise I have nothing but the highest praise for this aged marvel. Quite simply one of the best beers to ever pass betwixt these humble lips. 
Let's see...where to begin? If fruit were crystallised and mixed with the finest confectioner's sugar at a 3:2 ratio, it might taste something like this. The mouthfeel is perfect, light, spicy, and just barely drying -- perhaps due to the high alcohol content? Speaking of spice, whatever the monks dropped into this elixir is utterly compelling without being obnoxiously upfront. A large component of the beer, but a vital one that prevents heaviness, cloying sweetness, and complements the sweet fruit. The fruit is an intriguing mix of light (certainly lighter than I remember, primarily white grape or even soft peach) and dark (predominantly raisin, with some fig, and a perhaps a pinch of plum).
5O: Is there even any debate that this beer merits a perfect overall score? One of my all-time favourites, if infrequently consumed. Ageing improved the hell out of what was already a nigh perfect beverage. I must get more to lay down. Supremely recommended. World-class. Must have. 3,209 charactersAgentMunky, Jul 04, 2010

Pours a fizzy dark brown with about a finger of tan-colored head that disappears quickly. Smells of caramel & fruit. Taste is malty with signs of hoppy bitterness throughout. This is a full-bodied beer with higher-than-average carbonation and an oily feel. Mild alcoholic warmth at the end -- this is one smooth quad! 350 charactersbrystmar, Jul 04, 2010
3.99/5  rDev -10.7%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3We tried this along with a Westvleteren 12 and Westvleteren 8.
Pours dark brown with a moderate head. Strong, pleasant aroma. Powerful taste with notes of fig and soy sauce. Finishes hard with a little too much alcohol.
I was hoping that this readily-available quad would beat out the much harder to acquire Westy 12. Unfortunately, this could not compete. By comparison, the Rochefort 10 seemed almost like an extreme beer. It definitely had a better, stronger aroma. But unfortunately the taste was a bit too strong with an excessive alcohol presence. Despite being aged for 9 more months, this did not mellow out enough to be a close enough in comparison to the much softer Westveltern 12. It is a decent beer, but not something I will seek out very often. 761 charactersPrinceDarren, Jul 02, 2010

4.18/5  rDev -6.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.5At first sight, this is a nice, darkly colored beer. The color itself is a nice dark chocolate, with a light tan head. The head, when poured slowly into a tulip glass, takes up one third of the glass' volume. After a few minutes, I see a bit of lace.
As I give it a good long smell, I'm inclined to say Holy Cow, that's malty! If you are into malty beers, I can't imagine you not loving this one.
The first taste sensation that hits me is sweetness, but from what? I'd guess that this would be the roasted malt. I'm trying to determine if this is a chocolate taste, or a brown sugar taste. I'm leaning toward brown sugar; it's quite terrific. Hiding behind all that sweetness is the orangey citrus feel and nice carbonation. There's also a hint, or perhaps a strong suggestion, of spice in the aftertaste.
This is a powerful Jedi as beers go, so I wouldn't take it on too often. I definitely wouldn't drive after more than two of these; mercifully, I'm enjoying it from my place of residence.
This beer requires something strong to stand up to it food-wise; perhaps ribs done well, or a really well-prepared steak. Tasty! 1,125 charactersbogus564, Jun 28, 2010
4.33/5  rDev -3.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Appearance: dark caramel coloring, moderate particulate floating, head builds quickly with a medium to light density even with a fairly soft pour. The head is ivory white and fades to a thin layer fairly quickly. The brew is cloudy and only allows light to penetrate on the edges, something I would expect from a stout more than a Belgian Ale. The brew looks to have at least a moderate level of carbonation.
Smell: light spices, some fruity sweetness, maybe mild bananas or raisins
Taste: very fruity but not heavy, floral hops with a light bitterness. Not a real present malt flavor. Flows on the tongue smoothly then begins to tingle with the carbonation. The floral hops is really the dominant flavor, but it finishes with a flash of mild fruits that were evident in the aroma. A tinge of hoppy bitterness at the finish. Well balanced favoring the floral hops but not over powering. Surprisingly there is little to no alcohol burn nor taste even with the 11.3% abv.
Mouthfeel: medium carbonation, medium body, smooth in the mouth and on the tongue, tingly with the carbonation.
Drinkability: Not a session beer by any stretch, but certainly drinkable as an even sit down brew, I don't think I'd have this with a meal. 1,225 charactersATSJer, Jun 26, 2010

The nose is unbelievable. I get raisins, plums, molasses, pear, sweet pudding notes, banana and some alcohol. Incredible.
I find this beer incredibly hard to fault. It is a work of art. The flavour lives up to the nose and more. Comes across even sweeter, richer and juicier. So much sweetness and richness but the spicy and phenolic aspects of the yeast profile always keep it in check, along with what i assume is a very modest bitterness (i have trouble perceiving it in this brew).
It feels like sliding in to a freshly made set of sheets in a 5 star hotel bed. I don't normally wax lyrical in my reviews, but the smoothness of this is incredible. I want to sing about this.
The drinkability is amazing for a beer of this strength. I could easily and comfortably get through this in 5 minutes, though I certainly wont. 973 charactersjbowers56, Jun 19, 2010

A- pours a dark brown, near black, with a 2 finger light mocha colored head. Head fades rather quickly and laces gorgeously.
S- very sweet malt smell with a nice bit of that beautiful alcoholic smell you like once in awhile. I'm actually getting a slight hint of -- dare I say -- banana bread in there too. Quite interesting and complex.
T- heaven. Pure, unadulterated heaven. Its so mild, yet so flavorful...hints of alcohol shoot through your tongue, but they're not overwhelming at all. There is a good bit of sweetness, but as I mentioned...its not overwhelming. Very malty as well. Beautiful
M- feel is wonderful...body is upper medium on the spectrum, and mine is heavily carbonated. It almost feels like you're drinking a soda...without any of the nasty preservatives and artificial sweeteners
D- insanely drinkable. The alcohol doesn't smack you upside the head at all, though I wouldn't want to pound these back for the hell of it. Just tastes so amazing. Perfect beer to celebrate my 24th birthday and 100th review with. 1,147 charactersbigfnjoe, Jun 18, 2010

Poured into an oversized red wine glass. The body is a red-hued dark brown with a thin, off-white, bubbly head on top. Most of the sediment is left behind in the bottle. Gentle waves of lacing.
Sugared dates and figs on the nose. Lots of bready malt with a touch of alcohol. Damp, wet, malt. A little yeasty. Seems somewhat lacking, but is still pleasant.
Bready malts with a dash of plum and fig on the tongue. Slightly astringent alcohol. Almost has a faint solvent like characteristic to it. A touch of graininess. Mostly bready malts, a bit of sugared sweetness and some alcohol.
Mouthfeel is smooth, small/light carbonation and a decent amount of warming alcohol. Slight creaminess.
Drinkability is pretty good, especially for an 11% quad. One bottle is plenty for me. The alcohol seems a bit too strong in the flavor for my taste and there seems to be this solvent like quality that takes away from the overall enjoyment. Also, the complexity seems lacking compared to other Belgian quads I've had, which doesn't bring me back to my glass as quickly.
Overall, the Rochefort 10 is a decent quad, but does not even come close to the St. Bernardus 12 or the Westvleteren 12. I've had the 10 before and each time it just seems like a bit of an alcohol bomb without much going on. The 8 in my opinion is a much better beer from Rochefort. However, I've still got two more 10's in the cellar, so I think I'll put another 5-10 years on those before I touch them. 1,496 characterssisuspeed, Jun 18, 2010
3.68/5  rDev -17.7%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3Pours a deep red/light brown with a good two and half finger head. It's bottle conditioned and thus unfiltered. I went ahead and dumped most of the yeast into the beer since it's a Belgium Quad. A nice light brown head leaves good lacing. It smells of sour fruits and earthiness with a lot of yeast esters and alcohol.
I get a lot alot of alcohol warm immediately with dark fruit flavors that have a bit of sweetness. But this is my no means a sweet beer, there is enough bitterness in the back end to keep it balanced. This is my first Quad so I don't have much to compare it to. Carbonation is on the high side, giving it bit of a champagne-like quality. Definitely a dry beer that doesn't leave much after it's hit the tongue. 730 charactersryno09, Jun 18, 2010

4.58/5  rDev +2.5%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Extremely sticky head that does not want to go away. Lacing is Extreme! This is a deep brown beer. The light sends ruby streams through it. Yummy!
Chocolate, brown sugar, raisins and some candied flavor i can't quite pin down.
No lack of flavor here. Delicious dark roasted malts assault the palette along comes molasses, pepper and other Belgian spices. A slightly smokey taste with a pleasant hop finish. Alcohol is very well masked. Its only until you are fairly buzzed that you realize how strong this thing is.
Smooth and creamy. Its on the heavy side of medium bodied.
Get your hands on some delicious meat and cheese and take your time with this beautiful brew. 672 charactersHopBacchus, Jun 13, 2010
4.95/5  rDev +10.7%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 511.2oz bottle served in a st bernardus oversized wineglass.
pours a murky, deep mahogany tone; finger, finger and a half of creamy beige/off-white head with solid retention and nice walls of lacing; fair amount of sediment.
the nose is a big, rich bouquet of raisins, figs, belgian yeasts, caramel malts, brown sugar, and booze. smells deliciously complex.
more of the same pull through in the taste; a nice and very tasty balance between the dark fruits, caramel sweetness, belgian yeast, spices, and warming alcohol which ensues - relatively well hidden considering north of 11% ABV... as the beer warms, the flavors really emerge. utterly delicious.
i'd put the moutfeel at little above medium-bodied; a bit of chew to it, creamy with average carbonation and dangerously drinkable.
IMO, in the final analysis this is simply a world class beer. when i first began drinking quads i started on this guy, and then worked my way around a fair bit (westvleteren 12 still to go), sampling some great beer, but in the end nothing has come close. every time i return to rochefort 10 i'm reminded why it stands alone - hype or no, this is probably my favorite beer of all time. well done, monks of the brasserie de rochefort. well done. 1,234 charactersperrymarcus, Jun 13, 2010

Pours a nice dark brown with a nice three-finger head that lingers througout with a dusting of brown sediment on the top. Lacing is excellent throughout. The aroma is comprised of fruit and alcohol. The flavor is full of fruit, malt, nuts, and big alcohol notes. It was medium on the palate with high carbonation. Overall I am glad I got to try this and am happy it is readily available to myself. The aroma and flavor of this brew is nothing short of awesome. Definitely try this given the opportunity if you have not yet. 564 charactersthagr81us, Jun 02, 2010

A: Dark brown cloudy pour with lots of foamy dark tan carbonation. It took about 5 minutes to fully pour it due to the head.
S: Bready, figs, maybe cherries, molasses and some mustiness. Very nice aroma!
T: This beer tastes very nicely! So much going on--lots of dark fruit, caramel/bready maltiness with some mustiness in there. The alcohol is slightly warming.
M: Very full mouthfeel with an almost prickly finish.
D: As always, due to an abv over 11%, drinking a few of these might end the night early however....the taste and mouthfeel are great and I would gladly crack another one if I had it.
I feel very fortunate that this quad is widely available in the Boston area along with St. B Abt 12. Are these 2 quads on par with the 'legend' Westy 12?? I don't know but they're pretty darn good. I haven't had a lot of quads but I've had a lot of beer and this Rochefort 10 is great! 948 charactersAdamdc, Jun 01, 2010

I have to give this a slight bit less solely because this was off the cask at Muggs in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. It has a beautiful sour vegetable taste. Crisp and nice hops. Wonderful brew. 295 charactersAmalak, May 29, 2010
4.27/5  rDev -4.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from the 330 ml bottle into a snifter.
Pours a deep brown with some sediment in the glass. Pour produces a one finger deep cream colored head that has solid retention but leaves only slight lacing down the glass.
Smells of over ripe fruits primarily, with some underlying tones of caramel with some booze preset.
The flavor is delicious, but I could see how this brew could benefit from some aging. The alcohol was very noticeable, at times making it hard for the fruit in the flavor to shine like it really should. Don't get me wrong, the flavor was delicious. My only quip is that the fruit tasted great with the small bit of caramel present, and at time the alcohol made it less noticeable. I'm sure if it were aged for a bit this issue would not be present, and this beer would be truly spectacular. 813 charactersHURTemHIZZY, May 27, 2010

M: I love the way the flavor just hangs there for ten seconds after you take a swig. Only gripe is the extremely high level of carbonation. 
D: I couldn't drink these all day since they are heavy, but all beers of this type are heavy. There's nothing particular about this one that makes it more appealing than others of its type. 550 charactersDarrinRasberry, May 26, 2010
4.35/5  rDev -2.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a deep reddish brown color with a thin dark head that fades fairly quick leaving a decent amount of lacing.
Smell is of plum, rum, fruit that is far to ripe.
Taste is very much like the smell. Very full body. I've had this bottle aging in my cellar for about a year and the booze on this one is still a bit to much. I think 3-5 years would be more in line for this beer. Heavy sweet fig flavors. Still a slight medicinal hint, but not nearly as bad as when fresh. 
This is a very heavy rich beer, that has some alcohol heat. In my opinion it's a little harsher than other quads and not as well balanced, but that makes it a perfect aging candidate. There are some harsh medicinal notes that I think would mellow out and blend well with the beer over time. No doubt a good beer though. 793 charactersweissbierdrinker, May 26, 2010

Notes of baked bread and mild, musty oxidation. Meticulously crafted with two large, beautiful fingers of deep tan mousse-like head (great retention), leaving behind trails of sticky lace on top of a deep purple nearly black body; a perfect appearance.
Medium to high carbonation and exhibiting a tongue coating character that accentuates the sweet grain and candi sugar finish. Faint alcohol warmth with flavors of sugary dark bread with raisins. Medium bodied with low to medium perceived bitterness.
Well balanced and simply deliciously drinkable; a heavenly brew. 658 charactersTheJollyHop, May 26, 2010
4.72/5  rDev +5.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Serving glass: Poured from bottle into Snifter.
Appearance: Extremely dark brown with thin, but lasting, cream colored head.
Smell: Loads of figs, raisins and plums, with a strong combination of musty yeast and alcohol.
Taste: Pretty similar to the smell - plum, figs and raisins, with an intoxicating mix of the musty and sweet. Can't really explain why this tastes so damn good.
Feel: Low carbonation, thick chewy body. Very smooth and a little warming.
Drinkability: Wow, an 11% abv beer that is very easy to drink. Just fantastic. 539 charactersbsp77, May 23, 2010

Smell: Bready aroma with light and clean fruit tones. This aroma is amplified as the beer warms a little. 
Taste: Ultra smooth bready taste with a little bit of caramel and candi sugar thrown in. Fruity tones blend in and appear adding a second dimension to the tasting. Warming alcohol begins to build at the end and persists. 
Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied and ultra smooth in texture.
Drinkability: Giving it a 4.5. Very drinkable IMO, but may be a little much for the average beer drinker. Does not mean it's poor by any means- just a beer to work up to.
Overall- Enjoy it slowly. A top-class beer that's a real treat. Would hate to have this too often, as I would not want to get too used to the quality of this kind of beer. 862 characterscoalcracker, May 22, 2010
4.52/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Poured into a DFH snifter with the yeast left behind.
Pours a deep brown akin to a cider with a super fluffy, yet fine three finger tan head. Just huge, beautiful, and supremely dense. Moderate lacing on the glass.
Aroma is of candy sugar, apricot, belgian yeast with some earthy notes. A very sweet aroma! The fruits and breadiness of the yeast dominate overall. Smells delicious...
Taste is wonderful.. and follows the aroma closely. Fairly sweet, the fruits and yeast take over as does the ABV. Some earthy bitterness rounds out the sweetness and brings a great balance. This may be a relatively fresh bottle as the last time I had rochefort 10 I don't recall it as being as in your face. 
Mouthfeel is chewy and viscous. There's lots of carbonation to round everything out.
Drinkability is good. I would never drink more than one in a sitting though.
Between this and Orval, I'd have a hard time picking my favorite beer. 931 charactersTorps, May 22, 2010

S: Nice smell, great balance of sweet to malts.
T: The taste is surprisingly sweet. But the stongness of the beer trumps the sweetness to balance it out nicely. Great blend of malts and whatever makes the beer so sweet.
M: Decently thick. The beer has a good amount of chew, but I was expecting a little more.
D: Drinkable - Yes. But at 12%, I wouldn't recommend sluggin back too many of these. The beer is very good, and obviously very drinkable.
Overall: Overall the beer did not disappoint. This is a fancy beer, and tastes very good. The only thing that is throwing me are these brown chunks that are floating in the beer. I'm not sure if it's from the specific bottle or something else. If anyone knows, please send me a BA beer mail. Thanks. 930 charactersbgildea, May 21, 2010

S - Very complex. Definitely prunes and apples, a little chocolate and a little alcohol.
T - Happily this is where the beer really shines. Same complex flavor that's present in the nose. Really beautiful balance and the Belgian yeast is prominent, lending that familiar biscuit quality to support the other flavors. A little alcohol, but not as much as the ABV lets on. Very nice.
M - Nice medium body, but I think the carbonation is a little too forward.
D - Very good for this ABV and style, which means one bottle will be fine, thanks.
Not really my favorite style (I prefer Belgian tripels) from the abbeys, and not my favorite in the style either. That said, it's a pretty tasty brew, and I'm having fun drinking it. My wallet isn't as happy, though... 943 charactersjpittman80, May 20, 2010

A: dark brown with an organish tint. one finger tan head with good retention. Nice lacing. Unfiltered.
S: This is one great smelling brew. A unique smell...the first thing I thought of was granny smith apples, then some prunes mixed in.
T: Very clean, yet complex. Every sip is refreshing and reveals a new layer to peel back. I get a small amount of hoppiness to start but then the dominating flavor is of sweet raisins, brown sugar.
M: smooth, medium viscosity. The level of carbonation is just to the point where it adds something to the overall experience, but is not overpowering.
D: I could drink this all day long. Perfect balance. 683 charactersglazeman, May 18, 2010
5/5  rDev +11.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A- pours a deep dark burgundy with shreds of rosewood highlight at the bottom of my tulip. the head is loud and fizzy and foamy, light beige in color, with flecks of chocolate colored yeast. the first 50% of foam settles rather quickly but the second half retains quite a long time for such high abv. in fact it never loses its dense soapy ring and film of tan foam, even to the bottom of the glass after a half hour review. 
S- an insanely complex combination of clove, banana, milk chocolate, fig, prune, vanilla, roasted pear and plum, black grape, molasses, and some wood stone and soil notes. there's no wonder this is a paradigm of trappist excellence. it's taking me back to the first time i cracked a chimay.
T- at damn near 55 degrees, the flavor is so robust and leveled that it becomes hard to describe. starts off with a bit of floral alcohol bitterness that weaves its way in and out of the other flavors throughout the entire flavor profile. this in combination with a light vinous hop bitterness sets the stage for wonderfully spicy phenolic yeast and delicious sweet roasted and caramel flavored malts. peppercorn, banana, clove, bubblegum, plums, pears, figs, dates, and apricots all somethered in a cognac and candi sugar reduction and poured hot over a well worn leather jacket. malt flavors of chocolate covered raisin sweetness tease out a very light orange tartness with sugared strawberries and diluted coffee. earth. granite. peat. oak barrels. vanilla. very very light anise and cinnamon. sweet and delectable but in no way cloying or sugary. a divine 5 way balance between sweet bitter spicy fruity and earthy. the finish is lingering and thought provoking and i contemplate why there are visions of sugarplums dancing in my head. 
MF- on the first sip, carbonation sizzled on my cheeks like water on a hot skillet. once the beer opened up, the texture became smooth as a velour jumpsuit, smooth as the jazzy crooning of the velvet fog himself. note: it was the warming effect of the alcohol in my chest that made me associate this beer with mel torme. it's luscious. it's carbonated yet not carbonated. all at once having a tannin texture of grape juice, the creaminess of whole milk, and the consistancy of melted chocolate. it leaves the lips sticky but the cheeks clean and dry thanks to the booze.
D- so, me and my buddies put the other 3 bottles into the beer bong and... joking. put the torches and pitchforks away. for such a sippin' brew this one cannot be put down. literally and figuratively. it is all around perfection. trappist brewers are geniuses of their trade and this may be the finest i've had thus far. in this case i saved the best for first and quadfest 2010 has kicked off to a glorious start. 2,747 charactershustlesworth, May 17, 2010

"The Abbey of St-Remy, in the southern part of Belgium, was founded in 1230, and the monks began to brew beer sometime around 1595. The beautiful small brewery in the abbey, Rochefort Trappistes, is one of only seven Trappist breweries in the world and makes full-bodied, deeply flavored dark ales. They are bottle-conditioned and among the world's most highly-respected beverages."

smell: port like, spicy, malty.
taste: As advertised by the nose but unbelievably mellow. The more I taste, the better this gets.

This is one of my favorite beers and I finally came across a few so I figure it's high time to review one.
A - Very dark, with lots of carbonation and a finger thick head that remained a long time. Gobs of lacing in the glass. The only thing I dislike about this beer is the amount of yeasty crud in the bottle, I usually pour carefully to avoid getting any in my glass but always end up with a few floaties.
S - this beer has a spicy, deep aroma that I've never smelled anywhere else.
T - stupifyingly good. coffee, figs, dates, cloves, brown sugar, and alcohol. It has an amazing depth.
M - Well carbonated with a heavy, solid feel to it.
D - I would drink this beer until I fell out of my chair, though the 11% ABV and the $7-8/beer cost makes me think twice about it. Nevertheless, I covet every drop in the glass. 847 charactersevilkalla, May 14, 2010

Nice dark looking beer with a great head. Nose is definitely classic Belgian yeast smell. Love that smell. Taste is a bit sweet with some great fruity esters. I get raisins, plum and figs. Its difficult to relay the rush of flavors because its much more complex than just that. Slight bitterness on the back end. Slight viscous mouth feel but very pleasant. Slightest hint of alcohol that is pleasantly warming. It may have also been phenols at the end as well.
Just a great Belgian Quad from a master brewery. 562 characterselvisnj, May 13, 2010

A- A nice dark brown, almost black, with a huge tan head.
S- Different and hard to pin-point. Has a raisin/fruit like sweeten with hint of roasted coffee. Really just something you have to smell for yourself.
T- Taste hits everywhere. Starts with a sweet hint of fruits, grapes. Finishes with a dark roasted coffee taste mixed with hint of the 11.3% ABV. Underneath everything there is a nice smooth malt taste that bring everything together.
M- Smooth, full bodied, and heavy.
D- Very good and easy to drink. I really could not see myself drinking more than one in a night, but a great sipper to enjoy. 645 characterslarryi86, May 12, 2010

Appearance: Pours a dark brown with red/garnet highlights. A thin, creamy head emerges with areas that look like sugar/cinnamon swirls on the top. Lacing is sporadic.
Smell: A candied sugar and caramel malt aroma hits the nose immediately, along with the scent of bananas, bread pudding and dark fruits(particularly plum and raisin).
Taste: This beer features sweet roasted malt, brown sugar, dark fruits(especially plum), bread pudding and a hint of anise. It finishes with the slow warmth of alcohol and a spicy, pepper zest.
Mouthfeel: Nice amount of carbonation. Smooth, very rich and creamy, it washes a fine, silky coating over the tongue. 
Drinkability: A high ABV does not necessarily dissuade you from drinking another. However, it is clear from the first sip that this beer should command respect and is truly worthy of your time. Thus, this beer is to be enjoyed slowly and methodically as its complexity will be exposed as it slowly warms.
Comments: A topnotch example of the Quad style. It shares many of the qualities of a fine brandy. 1,116 charactersMarvinSnyder, May 10, 2010
4.35/5  rDev -2.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5330ml bottle poured into my Smuttynose Big Beer glass (thanks Bruisin Ales!). Pours a rich mahogany, with ruby highlights when backlit. A frothy, 3 finger cream head with areas of almost cinnamon "swirls", receded after a few minutes to a thin layer with moderate lacing.
Smell is intriguing. Initially it is fruity, raisins and plums, but I also detect a slight almost sour apple. As it warms, a mild breadiness comes in to play, as does toffee, chocolate, and sneaky alcohol.
Taste is outstanding. The fruits are there, as is a pleasant roasted malt, followed quickly by a warming burn. Has a slight medicinal quality, but not in a bad way.
Mouthfeel is fantastic. More carbonation than I was expecting, and it has maintained a very lively, prickly feel throughout the glass. Coating to the mouth, sour apple lingers on the tongue.
Drinkability is also very good. High ABV, but I could very easily reach for another. I would guess it is at 60 degrees or so as I write this and it is only getting better. Two of these stretched out over a few hours would make for an enjoyable evening. Wish I had purchased two. 1,116 charactersbigbluebeerguy, May 09, 2010

Some distinct raisin and dark fruit aromas mixed with a pleasant boozy warmth.
Amazing rush of flavors with lots of carbonation; incredibly dry on the palate. A warm alcohol kick at first followed by rich raisin, molasses, vanilla, and toffee notes with a rapid finish reminiscent of dry champagne that blossoms into a lingering and mild maltiness.
One to sip and savor, for sure! Not overly sweet or boozy, this is a wonderful and complex Belgian, though I prefer the flavor profile of the Rochefort 8 just a bit more. 653 charactersgrittybrews, May 07, 2010
4.1/5  rDev -8.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Poured into Duvel tulip.
This is a deep mohogany color with slightly reddish hues. A tan head rose 3 fingers and had great retention. Lace is thin and spotty, but the spots hang hard.
Smells of coffee and English toffee... With loads of dark fruits- figs, plums, and dates. The taste hits all these notes, and adds a nice toasted nuttiness, maybe almond, towards the finish. There is also a great Belgian candy sugar sweetness. This coats your teeth with a thickness that isn't really representative of the thickness of the body. The body seems thinner than the finish suggests.
The level of carbonation is pretty good, this is really creamy as it slides across your tongue. Full body is smooth and really quite tastey. 
There is an almost brandy like quality as this warms up. Very pleasant.
Overall impression- absolutely worth drinking. 844 charactersAleWatcher, May 06, 2010

The smell is amazing! Coffee, not cheap American coffee or Starbucks over-roasted, but a complex Venetian brew, with bittersweet chocolate and maybe a shot of Grand Marnier. I'm loathe to taste this as I doubt it will live up to the smell.
The taste does disappoint from what you smelled, but only in so much as it does not match the nose. I taste prunes, a little alcohol on the roof of the mouth with a remnant of the chocolate and coffee at the back palate. You'd expect more alcohol taste from the 11.3% ABV, but it is well delivered.
A little lighter than expected due to the carbonation that lasts throughout the glass. There is heat, but it is subtle for its strength. There is a little bit of an earthy aftertaste, but it's not unpleasant. It does tend to linger on the tongue.
Not a beer to guzzle or gulp, but to quaff and enjoy. It's 11.3% APV makes it impossible to pound these down with some bros, but I can see having another. This beer could just as easily be served with a steak as it could being used as an after dinner digestive. 1,277 charactersNaugros, May 05, 2010
4.5/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5My 100th review. Poured into a small German wine snifter. 
A: Pours initially with two fingers of bountiful and smooth cream, which settles into an even creamier layer of head over the course of a few minutes. Fantastic lacing and staying power for the head. Body looks like liquid fossilized amber; a beautiful blend of deep plum, ruby, and crystal amber hues. Columns of tiny bubbles rise to sustain the crown.
S: Just about every incarnation of malt in beer can be detected in the nose of this monk's brew. Rich, sweet, toasty, caramel, and roasted. Every type of malt except the darkest roasted malts found in stouts and porters. Some sticky 'old' slightly sour notes cling to the edges of all this malt... as it should be for a Trappist beer. Some sweet plum, grape, chocolate and port lurks beneath the array of malts.
T: A near perfect balance of many flavors is the character of this beer. The initial flavors are of deep dark fruits; currants, plum, and grape come to mind. These rise to a crescendo, at which point the alcohol prickles nicely as the characteristic malts surge delicately to finish out the flavor experience. This beer is fine, never course. Always balanced, always deliberate. Subtle- this ale is not in your face. Glowing, rich, complex... truly worthy of its reputation and title.
M: I am drinking this at 55 degrees and it is warming as I sip to write the review. At this temperature, the mouthfeel is sublime. Smooth and full, with just the right amount of alcohol prickle and warmth, but less than could be expected. So rich, creamy, sticky, and smooth... 
D: High marks here as well. The alcohol is hidden just enough, but not too much. A delightful sipper. 
Overall: A beer of the ages this is... with true craftsmanship and art infused into its flavor and feel. A must have at some point in your life if you are a lover of fine ale. My highest regards to the monks who craft this ale... 1,927 charactersallforbetterbeer, May 04, 2010

M: A medium to full body. Nice and heavy to let you know what you are drinking. Light carbonation gave the beer a nice texture that accentuates the flavor.
D: Alcohol flavor is some what hidden making the beer very drinkable. I could put a few back without any problem, which is what I did. 646 charactersBanger530, May 03, 2010
4.5/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Yummy.
Dark brown, beautiful in the glass with long living head.
Smell: Strong with exotical fruits, strong sugar, tiny bit of vanilla. 
Taste: Great coordination with the smell. Dark fruit with hidden malt. The combination of spicy and sweet flavours is very complex.
Mouthfee: Soft medium body with good carbonation.
Drinkability: Awesomeness. Alcohol is hidden, so watch out. 383 charactersmmahut, May 01, 2010
4.53/5  rDev +1.3%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A - pours a dark brown with ruby red showing if you put some light through it. The head stays put wonderfully. The glass is left with clumps of head. The head never goes away, but stays in a thin layer above the beer. This is perfection.
S - Smells pretty darn good also. Lots of sweet brown sugar, fruits, dark malty. Makes my mouth water.
T - Wow, this is a very tasty beer. Sweet brown sugar dominates the palate, but not in an overpowering sort of way. Incomes beet, with some dark fruit, pears and a smooth boozy finish. As it warms up a bit I'm getting more roasted malts, very slight hints of chocolate and coffee. The booze on the back-end is the only thing that keeps this from a 5. Though it's really just nitpicking. This is an extremely tasty beer.
M - Pretty good here, slightly above my moderate level to the thick side, but overall nothing to complain about.
D - Despite the booziness of the beginning, it's wearing off a bit, whether by high abv affect on my mouth or by the warmth of the beer. Still a bit thick, though that is to be expected with a quad I suppose. I could probably put back a few of these, though I'm not sure I would want to at 11.3%.
Overall: This is a fantastic brew, nearly perfect in my opinion. Will definitely be on my shopping list again. 1,286 characterscakirkl, May 01, 2010
4.62/5  rDev +3.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5In one word, spectacular. Pours with a slight head, much darker than expected. Don't have a lot of light, but seems reddish brown and beautiful. Nose of blueberries, rich, fresh blueberries.
Full on the palate, but I don't detect the blueberries any more, nor very much alcohol, despite the high percentage. A few bitter flavors, but mellows out into just the slightest amount of licorice. Normally not a flavor I enjoy but this one is spectacular. Raisins and coffee manage to sneak through. Has a finish that keeps going much like a fine wine.
A good bit more complex than the St. Bernardus Abt 12, but I'm not sure it's better, or maybe I don't like it more. It's not a cheap beer by any means, but worth it. 713 charactersChizoad, Apr 30, 2010

Which leads to the great aroma of plums, raisins, and a sweet brandy smell. Taste is superb! A warming touch of sweet raisins, spices, and a pleasant sweet boozy/brandy port thing. This is the beer to end the evening with. An outstanding example of what a Quad is and should be. Very easy to drink and a super experience for the tastebuds. 423 charactersLiverpool08, Apr 30, 2010
4.46/5  rDev -0.2%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Live review. Poured into the Rochefort chalice, it is quite a sight. Typical brown quad body, some floaties from the yeast pour. I like the dregs, you may want to be more careful.
In the nose, cinnamon bread, lots of raisin and cinnamon. Smells a lot like the beer bread I bake, actually. More cinnamon-y than I would have thought.
Ooooh, big luxurious malt bomb. Lot of sweetness up front, with that nippy clove and cinnamon drying things out a bit mid to back palate, but not entirely. Lingering malty and honeycomb sweetness on the aftertaste. Big full flavor - you're not getting cheated here. Some quads like to show off the ABV a bit, but I don't get the 11.3% in the taste here, only in the feel with a little nasal burn. 
Speaking of feel, you would expect a world-class mouthfeel from a renowned Trappist brewery like Rochefort, and it does deliver on that front, with a substantive yet pillowy soft feel. 
For how quickly the glass gets drained, scary-good drinkability at this level ABV. The 10's as good as advertised. You might think of this as a steak beer, but I could also see it going really well with many desserts....bread pudding? And of course, no slouch by itself either. 
I concur with the overall BA review and that of the Bros, and then some. Avail yourself of it if possible. 1,306 charactersPatrick999, Apr 30, 2010
4.45/5  rDev -0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 330ml bottle into my Rochefort chalice. It poured a dark reddish brown color with a thin quarter inch tan head. The head faded only to leave a creamy ring around the edges of the glass.
The aroma has raisins, plums and plenty of other dark fruits to it. It also has a slightly spicy, yeast aroma present along with a little bit of alcohol rum like flavors. Very nice appealing and complex aroma overall.
The taste is just as the nose let on, complex and delicious. It has caramel, raisins, plums all coming through in the sweet malty taste up front. It finishes with a little of the rum like alcohol flavor that were also found in the nose.
The mouthfeel is full bodied with a creamy smoothness and moderate carbonation. Drinkability is very good, it's an excellent tasting beer. Overall it's an excellent tasting and drinking beer that I really enjoyed. 871 charactersbillab914, Apr 30, 2010

S Fruits including raisins, plums?, and figs?. Good dark malts and maybe a bit of dark candi sugar.

4.15/5  rDev -7.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Finally decided to grab this highly regarded brew @ Wegmans. Love Belgian beers but the quad is at the lower end of the spectrum for my taste. 
A: Pours a dark brown/ molasses like color with a nice tan head that stuck around until I finished the beer. Some visible carbonation and some sediment chillin at the bottom of my glass. 
S: I would say alcohol is the thing that jumps up front for me, some rich malts, prunes, raisins, caramel and honey. Pretty complex scents here. 
T: Very complex flavors here. My amateur palate was spinning but I will do my best to decipher the code. Prunes, malty sweetness, some spiciness, possibly cilantro, slight burn from the alcohol and tang in the aftertaste. Alot going on here.
M: Medium bodied. Somewhat syrupy with mild carbonation. Very nice. 
D: Not one I would tangle with more than once in a sitting. High abv and complex flavors makes this a one hitter quitter for me. Very delicious non the less. I can see where the hype comes from. 988 charactersPdiddey3d, Apr 28, 2010

5/5  rDev +11.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Served just under room temp and into a tulip glass. Was cloudy and dark in the glass with a large off-white head that stayed for about half of the glass. Malty smell, but not too much to the aroma. Taste was fruity and dry. Hints of apple and honey were present. There was a clean and foamy mouthfeel. This was a really enjoyable beer, but for $10 a single, I don't know if I'd buy it again.
4-23-2010: 
A: mahogany in color and translucent, though dark, rochefort presents an impressive beige head with great retention.
S: bouquet is bold and extraordinarily complex, with notes of prunes, honey, caramel, just to name a few.
T: despite its strength, the alcohol is lost amidst the myriad flavors presented in this work of art. Caramelized sugar, prunes, honey, and a touch of coriander create an amazingly complex flavor profile.
M: full bodied and slightly syrupy, Rochefort 10 displays moderate carbonation.
D: after 4+ years, I decided it was overdue 
that I revisit one of the most highly regarded ales in the world. I can easily say that it was a worthwhile effort. I'm not sure that in 2006, my first years in the beer world, I was able to truly appreciate the complex-yet-delicate nature of this outstanding ale. I stand with the masses and recommend this as one of the best brews available in the states. 1,320 charactersAvagadro, Apr 25, 2010
5/5  rDev +11.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Dark brown color, with a thin off-white head that disappears pretty quickly.
The most distinctive smelling and tasting quad around. Really tough to describe this one. It just tastes and smells like Rochefort. But I'll do my best. Smells of cocoa and some very pleasant and distinctive phenols, with hints of fig, rum, and vanilla. Alcohol is noticeable, but not overwhelming. Just enough to let you know it's there.
Taste is much like the aroma would suggest, but has a bit of a spicy (maybe coriander or cardamom?) zing to it that I didn't notice before tasting it. Also has some burnt sugar or molasses in the background. Very complex and amazing.
Mouthfeel is deceptive. The flavor and aroma suggest sweetness, but the beer is surprisingly dry (although it somehow feels creamy at times), with a pleasantly high amount of carbonation.
Very drinkable for an 11.3% quad. If I wasn't so concerned with savoring it, I could easily get in to trouble with these.
Overall, an amazing beer. There's really nothing like it around. Good enough to prompt me to write my first review in 2 1/2 years. 1,095 characterstomParis, Apr 25, 2010

Poured into a Leffe chalice, where I had to hold back a bit in the pour to keep the head under the lip. Foolish glass choice on my part. Oh wait, and what is that? My dog's fur. Shit. Let's not get distracted though and enjoy this damn beer. Sure looks nice with its fluffy head that laces atop the dark brown ale... The head is so stiff well into the session it still hold some drops of yeast that made their way out of the bottle.
Aroma... Hmmmm... Initially it was "What aroma". I stuck my nose deep within the chalice and got nothing. It was only after sipping away at the beer that some fruityness comes to the nose. Quite nice, but sure doesn't make up for the start when I really want the aroma to play big on my sense.
Now for the most important part. Taste. Yum. A hearty malt body with a residual sweetness that is perfectly balanced leaving you wondering where the 11+% alcohol is hidden away. Raisin dominates with other fruity notes and a wonderfully soft finish that I can't describe. A creamy mouthfeel with a light and lovely carbonation. A great and easily drinkable beer, save for it coming back to pound you with its hidden booze. 1,205 characterskjyost, Apr 24, 2010

Aroma: Medium intensity of the nose. Very complex. Strong marshmallow, rose, blueberry and mint aroma. Beautiful.
Taste: Very complex and layered. Candy, roses, blueberries on the front. Chocolate and mint on the midpalate. Coffee, smoky and earthy flavors on the back.
Palate: Silky, medium to medium full bodied. Low hop bitterness. Mild roasty finish. Lingering taste. Alcohol barely noticeable.
Drinkability: Truly remarkable. I was expecting a great brew and it exceeded my expectations. Its complex, unique, fits the style, sessionable (if you consider how hard it is to session a Quad) and very elegant. Will surely have again if possible. 859 charactersendovelico, Apr 24, 2010

A moderate level of carbonation is visible, along with yeast particles floating near the bottom of the glass.
S: Alcohol is definitely perceptible in the nose, along with faint aromas of dark fruits and malty sweetness.
T: The taste is complex and very well balanced between flavors of malty sweetness, dark fruits and spices. A slight taste of alcohol is noticeable in the finish.
M: It feels both medium-bodied and very smooth on the palate.
D: For such a strong beer, it is relatively easy to drink, especially as it warms up. 657 charactersmetter98, Apr 24, 2010

A bit of alcohol in the nose, but many other aromas present, all very subtle and blending together into something wonderful. Definitely some dark fruits, with a hint of raisin on top. An absolute taste explosion on the tongue. Some sweetness, with caramel and toffee in there. Maybe some vanilla and a host of fruits blending together. A great treat! Pricey, but I don't mind buying this one once in a while. Definitely one of the best. 555 charactersBoto, Apr 22, 2010
4.47/5  rDev 0%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.511.2oz. bottler served into a Trappistes Rochefort goblet
Pours a cloudy, opaque even, mass of chocolate pudding looking brown. Whatever. The tight cap of beige head sits on top for ever and ever at 1/2 finger in size in this Trappistes Rochefort glass. It looks fine enough.
This beer isn't a looker, which is okay because it is a smeller. Dark fruits -- drunken raisins and prunes and figs -- explode into the nose. Some dark cherries too. Darkly toasted bread adds a solid backbone to all the fruit. There is alcohol present, as there always seems to be in Quads.
Rochefort 10 excels in taste. The smoothness in which all of the intricate dark fruits and yeasty flavors are blended into each other is remarkable. Raisin leads into vanilla leads into toffee leads into fig and they are all expressed simultaneously after the first few sips. The alcohol isn't as noticeable as I thought it was going to be. Its there on the back end but it mostly compliments the flush of cherry on the finish. This is malty delight; a beer of deserved renown. 
For all of the strength of flavor that Rochefort 10 has the mouthfeel is pretty light. Its on the lighter end of medium-bodied. It carries all of the flavors pretty well; the smoothness of flavor is especially noteworthy considering that the body is not close to being creamy or anything. Drinkability is damn good compared to most other Quads I've had. The alcohol is barely noticeable on the tongue and the flavors are, again, so well integrated. 
Trappistes Rochefort 10 is a world-class beer. You'd be hard-pressed to find a beer that better exemplifies the term "craft beer." This is stupendously crafted. A beer like this can only be the product of a wealth of knowledge executed over hundreds of years. I'd advise you to take advantage of its existence. 1,811 charactersReaper16, Apr 22, 2010

S- Dark chocolate and roasted malts are found as well as some fruitiness. 
T- I can taste dark fruits, dark malt and the alcohol does not seem to be as high as is indicated making it a devilishly drinkable beer for the alcohol content. 
M- For it's darkness it surprisingly has a medium mouthfeel, no lingering bitterness or long alcohol burn, again making it easy to drink. 
D- This goes down smoothly so it's probably one that sneaks up on you quick if you have too many. 654 charactersschleprock, Apr 22, 2010

I must admit these haven't been my favorite style of beer, none the less I look forward to trying this. Poured into DFH signature glass.
A: Dark brown color with a big dirty tan head. Takes it's time to dissipate.
S: Dark fruits dominate, with some bananas, cloves and maybe toffee also present. Complex... maybe some vanilla in there also. The smells better and better as it warms. 
T: Pretty much follows the smell, but with a little hear from the alcohol in there also. Sweet dark fruits dominate with a little bitterness also. I kind of get hints of cotton candy too. 
M: Medium bodied nothing really spectacular here. 
D: Goes down easy for this high ABV. 
This is a solid beer, not exactly in love with it like some of the higher rated beers I've had, but I think it is just the style. I will try to review it again after i have had some more like it. 956 charactersBS68280, Apr 21, 2010

A- Pours a very dark chocolate brown with a little bit of the sediment from the bottom of the bottle being poured into the glass. About a half finger's worth of head that sticks around for a nice cap and leaves some decent lacing on the side of the glass.
S- Dark chocolate, roasted malts and a little bit of dark fruits. A little bit of alcohol peaks it's head through but not much. Reminds me a little bit of a stout but with the added dark fruits in there. Throw in a small amount of dark licorice and the scent is pretty complex.
T- The taste is like the nose but the dark fruits are much more dominant in the mouth than in the nose. Some dark chocolate, roasted malts and a slight sweetness that I can't nail down. The alcohol is very well hidden in the background but still present.
M- A good medium to heavy body mouthfeel with a pretty decent amount of carbonation. A little more than with some other quads I have sampled. Small amounts of bitterness and a little bit of warmth from the alcohol.
D- This one is obviously a sipper with the high ABV but it goes down smoothly. A solid brew all around but I was expecting a little something more from this one. 1,212 charactersWisconsinality, Apr 19, 2010

Smell is amazingly complex; almost weissbier like banana/clove esters and phenols abound, grapefruit, oaky vanilla, lots of malt, slight hint of alcohol. Taste is crazy, banana and clove once again, alcohol, earthy, oaky vanilla again, tastes oak aged, honey, a little bitterness from the hops but those take a back seat. Almost an armagnac vinousity (word?) to it, amazing. Very full mouth, warms all the way down, thick and chewy, perfect carbonation. 560 charactersAnthony1, Apr 18, 2010
4.7/5  rDev +5.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5First off i would like to say that i might be a little biased because I f-ing love this beer.
This beer has a deep brown color lightened up a tiny bit by the little specs of yeast floating around in it. Nice tan head that never disappears.
Smells sweet and alcoholic with many fruity tones in it that compliment the strong malt backbone. I get hints of cherries, plums, apples and maybe even a tiny bit of banana. 
Tastes VERY smooth for the high alcohol content. No alcohol is noticeable until the very end. It has a very subtle hint of chocolate to the flavor along with some burnt caramel. The yeast is the star in this beer as it should be, but it does have to compete with the overwhelming presence of sugars and alcohols in the beer. The hops come through a tiny tiny bit in the very end and just finnish this beer up perfectly. It is extremely well balanced. I absolutely love it!
This beer has a very nice and surprisingly light mouthful compared to how strong it is. It fills the entire mouth with flavor and leaves a creamy feel in your mouth. 
My hats off to the monks who brew this stuff for making this strong of a beer this drinkable. 1,153 charactersAlexTheAleMan, Apr 18, 2010

Smell is quite crisp, with subtle notes of dates and dark fruits.
Taste is quite enjoyable. A large bouquet of flavors starting with the slightly acidic tinge on the tongue that mellows out to a good Mediterranean fruit medley and finishes with a great aftertaste of chocolate.
Mouthfeel is surprisingly creamy considering the amount of carbonation.
Excellent beer. Most Excellent. 482 charactersSpineypanda, Apr 17, 2010
3.73/5  rDev -16.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Picked up all three Rochefort offerings for a side-by-side comparison. Here's review #3:
This intimidating Quad powers a dark taupe in color with a thin head and low carbonation. A beautiful white coat of lacing paints the side of the glass. This seems a touch more imposing than its baby brothers.
Alcohol power is evident, as is the tartness of cherries and a certain creaminess that presents a sweet and pleasant undercurrent. The aroma is extremely attractive.
The taste of cherry is the first flavor on display, which adds a certain acidic quality. This is followed by a distinct smokiness, bitter notes, fig and spicy nutmeg. As it warms, some roasted notes rear their ugly heads.
It's extremely surprising that such bold flavors are so well balanced. This could have been too strong to consume, but it never strikes a false note and presents the tongue with many a flavor to decipher.
Admittedly, this can be a bit of a powerhouse ABV wise, but it is still a rewarding experience. I think I respect it more than enjoy it and I'm under the impression that this will grow on me after the 9th, 10th and 11th tries. 1,123 charactersdeapokid, Apr 16, 2010
4.68/5  rDev +4.7%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured into a St. Bernardus chalice.
A: Pours a huge billowing head making me leave out the last couple ounces in the initial pour. This head is going nowhere fast, but leaves some spotted chunky lacing. Very dark mahogany brown with the slightest amount of light getting through the bottom. The final pour gives way to several floaters.
S: Strong dark fruits - cherries, plums, and raisins. A sweet caramel or toffee maybe is also present in small amounts. No heat detected.
T: The smell follows through here completely. Dark fruits upfront with a faint sweet chocolate or caramel finish. Wonderful blend of everything that makes a quad great. A little heat detected, but alcohol is very well hidden.
M: Immediately the pour suggested high carbonation, but the feel is not so much. The sweet fruits and malts linger in the mouth but not for long. This was really the only flaw IMHO in this beer.
D: This and St. Bernardus are easily my favorite quads. The pricetag, however, are not. Easy drinkin, but I allow myself only one every so often with the price and alcohol to factor. Would love to have a fridge full of these. 1,127 characterskirkpjr, Apr 14, 2010

M - Smooth with a fair amount of carbonation. Very true to the style.
D - My only regret is that I only bought one bottle of this (price made me a little nervous). I will be going back and purchasing more the next chance I get. One of the most drinkable and best tasting beers that I have ever had the pleasure of trying. 674 charactersKanebanger, Apr 14, 2010

4.6/5  rDev +2.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4an 11.2 oz bottle poured into an oversized wine glass. pours opaque, nearly black, but actually a really dark brown. the head is a light biege color that is huge, billowy, and soapy. fades to a nice 1/4 inch of head with some nice retention. some decent lace. the end of the bottle left a little yeast on top of the head that reminded me of a sprinkle of cinnamin that lasted almost the whole beer. lots of chunky yeast visible in the beer as well.
some big alcohol in the aroma, nice yeasty phenolic aroma, a little flouride. ripe dark fruits, raison, plum, fig. maybe a touch of grape.
so complex, truly an authentic belgian, no american take on this style can come close to this. not even some belgians. in no paticular order- hints of cocoa, plum, fig, raison, grape, ripe dark fruits, phenolics, spice, brown sugar, some sweet malts, slightly alcoholic. bready, yeasty flavors. so many complex melding of flavors that i just dont have words for. i really want to go for a 5 but i dont know if i have it in me.
subliminal mouthfeel, truly the nectar of gods, creamy, velety. such fine carbonation.
if you forget about the alcohol(or not) how could you not want to drink this all night. truly world class. i cant wait to see how it ages. a must have for ANY beer drinker. 1,278 charactersdogfishandi, Apr 11, 2010
4.9/5  rDev +9.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Appears to be a dark hazy brown that is pretty much opaque. Perfect, full, 2-finger, foamy, almost-nitro-looking, light khaki head with amazing retention - it seriously never goes away. 
Aroma is sweet and inviting. Rum raisin is immediately noticeable. Complex spiciness that reminds me of a holiday dessert. A very very light smokiness. This is good.
Wow. Warm sweetness that never comes close to cloying. That same kind of delicate holiday spiciness is here, but it has an almost savory nature - it kind of gives the impression of honey ham. The finish is a little more fruity with cherries and dark fruits layered with sweet dark breads. Finish is sweet. Despite the nature of this beer, there is a refreshing blast that hits you right when it hits your tongue that seems to lighten it up a little bit and make it even more drinkable.
The body contributes a creaminess to the mouthfeel that is juxtaposed by an effervescence from the very lightly fizzy carbonation. Spicy and tingly in the finish. Feels a little sugary on your tongue after it goes down. 1,061 charactersNCBeernut, Apr 10, 2010

S: very sweet, almost caramelized fruit, prune. a dark rum like alcohol aroma. a hint of what i am assuming is more malt earthy than hop earthy. smell has a few similarities with a dopplebock 
T: sweet candi sugar hit with again caramelized fruit, sweet malt to the max, a slight bitter yeast because i almost forgot there was yeast in the bottle. a very light almost not noticeable hop earthiness. alcohol is a given within this style and is noticeable yet seem almost hidden.

Bottle served, I got the beer from private importe via QuébecBière.info We do not have this beer on the very far behind Quebec beer market, which sucks :(
Appearance is great, I served it in a Tulip Glass very thick brownish head, dark brown liquid color and alot of sediments in the glass, I love having dead yeast sediments in beers and wines, it just shows that the damn thing is alive!
The Smell is great, alot of sweet Malt flavors, toffe like caramel, brown sugar and a touch of star anis.
Taste's lovely, the mouthfeel is quite strong, it's a long lasting beer on the palate, The carbonation is very soft and a bit creamy.
I bought a pack of 24, I'll try to keep it for about 4 years, drinking only 6 of them each year...lets just see how this goes!

A- dark currant brown, lightly cloudy, off white head, left a nice cap. Yeast was swirled and added. Lovely lacing.
S- Dark raisins, holiday spices, splash of spiced rum. Heavy caramel tones, touch of yeast. All wonderfully balanced. If they made this into a perfume, I'd make my gf wear it all the time.
T- Holy damn! Lots of rich toffee, caramel, and a touch of roastedness. Sweetness of black currants, buckwheat honey, and molasses. A myriad of flavors that meld perfectly to form a picture of perfect harmony. Spiced rum-soaked candy currant toffee cakes. Most divine.
M- Smooth and velvety, well carbonated. Not too thick, not thin at all. Full bodied and wonderfully smooth with a nutty, dry finish.
D- Good gravy, this is an elixir fit for an emperor of beer. Give me another bottle or three please.

Re-review from 5/23/09 notes. Bottle #230113 07:59 aged at least 8 months. Served at 45°F in a tulip and allowed to warm.
A - Poured a lovely dark brown with maroon hues in the light. Magnificent 2" tan head that retained forever with light spots of lacing. Swirled and added yeast, which settled to the bottom. 
S - Raisins, toffee, and spiced rum. Light notes of black currants came through followed by sweetness of candi sugar. Vanilla too? A hint of tawny port rounds out the nose with a touch of alcohol. Impeccable. 
T - A delicate sweetness of toffee introduces my palate to a hearty dose of dark malts, followed shortly by a blend of currants, dates, and dark chocolate bitterness. The sweetness lingers and beckons another sip, upon which realizes a toffee and raisin-like finish. The alcohol is barely noticeable, well hidden in a barrage of delicate and intricately woven flavors. Moste Excellente! 
M - Medium/full bodied and well carbonated. Quite smooth and befitting for a quad. Carbonation is not sharp, but lends a creamy texture to the beer.
D - Extremely drinkable and quite a sipper. I could sip this all night and day.
Overall: This is undoubtedly one of the most top notch examples of the style and IMO, the best example. As it warms, the complexity increases exponentially and the resulting flavors and textures explode, enriching and enlightening the palate.

Got a few of these for a steal at Hegedorn's in Webster, NY. $6/each, can't go wrong. I bought all of them on the shelf (there were only 5 left haha)
A - dark garnet brown with a 1/2" tan head with excellent retention and nice Belgian lacing in a chalice. 
S - caramel/toffee malts, some dark, ripe figs and currants. Slight yeastiness and strong spice. Hints of nutmeg as well. All bundled in a waft of alcoholic goodness. 
T - Deep winelike bitterness with a sweet malty backbone. Some fresh hops, prunes, raisins, and... roasted nuts?! Very strong alcohol as well. 
M - Medium bodied and well carbonated. Impressively smooth and warming. 
D - Highly drinkable for a 11.3% beer. I had to exercise self control and only allow myself one of these gems while I let the others age. 
Overall - This is truly a remarkable beer. I was skeptical when reading so many awesome reviews, thinking it was hyped up. Just when I expected another Belgian strong ale, it smacked me a few times and proved just how good it really tasted. A fine beer, no doubt. Truly one of the best beers I have ever tasted. The only thing preventing me from giving it a perfect 5 is that the taste was just a tad young. I wish there was a way I could rate the taste as a 4.75 instead of 4.5. Bottled in 2008, I think this will certainly benefit with age. Do yourself a favor and buy two of them and enjoy them with your best friend.

4.35/5  rDev -2.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Appearance - Pours into my Bell's Tulip with a hazy dark brown color that shows slight hints of red when held up to the light. About two fingers of wonderful head are achieved with a moderate pour and abundant chunky lacing is left.
Smell - Heavy dark fruits like figs and raisins, molasses, coco, brown sugar, and other herbal spices. A slight alcoholic presence is noted, along with the medicinal sweetness in each whiff.
Taste - Extremely complex in flavor. At the beginning there are dark fruits like figs, plums, etc. which gives way to subtle spices and other flavors such as vanilla, bready sweet malts, and toffee/caramel. Finishes on a sweet note.
Mouthfeel - Medium bodied, creamy, decent carbonation.
Drinkability - A huge sipper. I had this over the course of a couple hours. A definite one and done type of drink. I have been putting off having this one for quite some time but am thankful I have another in the cellar. 936 charactersSpdKilz, Apr 06, 2010
4.7/5  rDev +5.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Rochefort 10 into wide goblet, at cellar temp
Pours a deep and murky brown with maroon and golden highlights. Has a half inch tan head of tiny but short lived bubbles. This is the only Trappist beer that I have ever had that doesn't puff up with a huge head. Strings of delicate lace trail on the way down. A creamy ring and sea foam stay along for the ride. 
Nose is powerful with dark fruits, alcohol, earth, spice, figs, dark malty sweetness, citrus, dark caramel, fresh leather, rum-raisin, yeast, white pepper. Not in-your-face powerful, but beautifully balanced and elegant. All the way through I find my nose stuffed back into the glass for another wiff, and somehow each time I find something different.
Softly sweet dark dried fruits, figs, rum soaked fresh raisins, pepper, soft caramels, apricot pit, yeast, jasmine tea (floral), boozy heat, plum skin, earth. Powerful and exotic with a truly refined quality, this is the sort of beer that people won't believe that it actually is a beer. Finish is juicy and prickly at the same time. And yes, this beer shows it alcohol, but still meshes it into the flavor seamlessly. 
Mouthfeel is soft and luxurious, with a moderate heft and a perfectly balanced medium-high carbonation that foams ever-so-slightly across the palette. 
This beer is epic, in every sense of the word. I have tried this many times before, and I always cower at the thought of even attempting to review it. I simply don't think I can do it justice. There is so much complexity, power, and finesse that it seems that a novel could be written it its regard. Surely I am waxing poetic, but this is one of only a handful (like three or four beers) that deserve this type of enamoring verbiage. Yes, it's pricey. Yes, it's consuming in its alcohol level. And yes, it nearly defies accurate description, like trying to decipher ancient script. But none of that matters, because although this beer is seemingly scary, it is almost universally well received among (even among the non beer nerd crowd), something that most beers above 11% ABV simply cannot say. 2,085 charactersFlashsp2, Apr 06, 2010
4.75/5  rDev +6.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a deep brown with a red hue, its murky and almost opaque, but you can still see thousands of bubbles rising along the inside of the snifter. The head starts off almost two inches and falls to about half an inch. The head is off white in color.
The aroma is vinous and complex. It is fruity ( figs, apples. raisins, dates), has some mellow funk / yeasty, with faint hints of toffee and brown-sugar. Alcohol tickles the nose. Nice balance between sour, sweet, and funky.
Taste like a good semi-sweet wine to me. Fruity ( grapes, apples, figs, plums, prunes ) and spicy/vanilla, the alcohol warms things up.
Mouthfeel is wet and full boddied, a slight fiz from the carbonation, its warm, flavors coat my tongue, nice long finish and aftertaste.
This beer is a pleasure to drink; everything is balanced and in place. The alcohol and calories will limit how many Ill enjoy. 878 characterssitarist, Apr 06, 2010

From: The Beer Temple
G: Chimay Chalice
A: Dark brown body with two fingers of off white head. Head retains for a good about then dissipates to a fine ring. Load of sediment at the bottle of the glass. 
S: Alcohol stings the nostrils, then presents a mixture of dark fruits (figs and raisins). Toffee/molasses are noticeable but not dominant. 
T: Much like the smell, there is a great mixture of figs and raisins mixed with some sweet malts. The yeast also shows up at room temperature which adds more more dynamics. 
M: Medium bodied with medium-high carbonation. The carbonation makes for a frothy texture and leaves a sticky hot aftertaste. Alcohol is very clear here, but it isn't so hot to turn you off it. 
D: Amazing brew here. If this was aged for a bit I would enjoy it more, but that would only increase my liking for it. I'd buy it again if I could find it. 881 charactersLong813, Apr 05, 2010

A- Dark brown in color. Pours a big 3'' head from a slightly aggressive pour. Decent retention with some spotty lacing.
S- Alcohol is first and in your face. Then I get caramel, molasses, and some apples.
T- This is a fresh bottle. It's very hot. There is a sweetness that is very abundant followed by some spices. There is a caramel apple bite to it.
M- Pretty syrupy.

4.3/5  rDev -3.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Rochefort pours a dark brown, can't really see through it. There is quite a bit of sediment in the bottle. A half finger head appears but quickly disappears into a bubbly brown brew. 
I can smell all kinds of raisins, grapes, and yeast. There is a bit of candy apple with the alcohol stinging the nostrils.
The first taste of this is quite shocking. I can't quite figure it out...but more sips help. I can point out some pear, molasses, and tons of raisins. There is a bit of burnt nutty taste that blends into a big boozy presence. I swallow this and my belly warms immediately.
It is a medium body in the mouth, very smooth, and I would not guess it at 11%. One would think it would leave a dry mouth, but I have a half dry half wet aftertaste that lasts forever.
This beer is very complex and it improves as it warms. I wish I would have waited longer with it out of the fridge. Interesting beer this is. 911 charactersTCgoalie, Apr 04, 2010
4.72/5  rDev +5.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5I still have pleasant memories of a Flemish server at a restaurant in Ghent explaining to me that it isn't "rock-e-fort" like the cheese but "RocCHCHCHCH-fort" with an unbelievable gutteral sound.
Anyhow, I poured a 33 cL bottle (stamped 311213 08:32, whatever exactly that means) into a Chimay challice.
A: Woodsy brown that poured with a tan creamy head that died to a smooth film; although, there are bubbles constantly running up it.
S: It is a really sweet, slightly alcoholic musty prune and raisin smell. The backbone is brown sugar sweet bread.
T: The front end is a sweetness of coffee cake with blackberries, but the finish in the back of the mouth is a slightly metallic bitterness of excessively earthy--almost moldy--tart hops, which is almost reminiscent of a sour mash without the sourness.
M: Big frothy with crisp little bubbles, bordering on slightly syrupy.
D: Awesome; I wouldn't even know it was 11.3% ABV. 927 charactersne0m00re, Apr 04, 2010
4.8/5  rDev +7.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Gentle pour from 330ml (11.2 oz) bottle into my Karmeliet glass still produces a frothy 4 finger head, tan in color. After a few minutes, the head subsides leaving a good amount of lacing that also falls after a few minutes. Body is very dark brown & does not allow any light through. Color remains dark brown even around the edges. There are some dark dregs in the middle of the head, almost giving the appearance of nutmeg floating on the head.
The nose is complex & sweet, primarily of dark fruits; plums, figs, & raisins. Strong malt character as well, along with some pleasing alcohol as the other aromas fade. There is an underlying spiciness as well.
Taste is close to the nose, but with added undertones of cocoa. The heavy malt backbone shines here, as it does not overwhelm the delicious fruit flavors. The dark fruit dominates, as with the aroma, but in turn, does not overwhelm the maltiness. A perfect balance.
This beer feels medium in body as the carbonation, while producing a significant head, is in no way excessive. It adds a tingling, almost spice-like feel as it subtly dances on the tongue. It finishes with an ever-so-slight alcohol burn, more like a warming.
I would never know that this has a high ABV (11.3 %) if I hadn't read it on the bottle, as the drinkability is one of the best I have had in this ABV range. It is so smooth, with excellent taste, that it could be easy to overindulge.
Glad I finally got to try this, and it did not disappoint. I am sure I'll be buying more of these, as it is a steal at $5.29/bottle. An excellent value, highly recommended. 1,594 charactersBulkman, Apr 03, 2010

Ap= it was from the bottle so bottle was too dark to tell. (asume from from the taste, smell, aroma it was great)
smell= Was GREAT lovely coffe dark, carmel deep aroma
Taste= was wonderful. coffee, carmel, deep rish taste little alcohol at the end.. balanced at the end A overall taste
m= great it had everything a good beer needs, it had the flavor, the smell, the aroma, the everything. a bit alcohol at the end. thats about it. but otherwise it was a A+/
Drink ability= this is where this beer lacks. only because its such good beer. I think its a little too good for its own good. it has just about everything I want it a beer but being so strong and having a strong acohol taste at the end it lacks the drink ability.

4.48/5  rDev +0.2%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Trappistes Rochefort 10. 11.2 oz. bottle.
Appearance:
Poured at 55 degrees into an Ommegang chalice. It's a dark, deep, rustic cigar brown with a murky, swirling vortex of lethargic carbonation. A 1.5" clumpy, fragile mocha head plumes casually. Thick lacing coats the side of the glass. It's brooding, captivating, and just a little bit foreboding. Unfiltered dregs hang below the surface, suspended in the viscous substance. Oddly, I imagine it as a sort of fertile swamp -- lush, decaying but beautiful. And beneath the surface crocodiles and dangerous things lie brooding and alert. The drink almost creates its own ecosystem.
Aroma:
Dark, full brown sugar is prominent. Cocoa, raisins and herbal phenols. Thick and mesmerizing -- a canopy of heavy, warm, sweet aromas hangs inches above the dark brown pool of murky liquid. 
Taste:
Peppery and medicinal. Alcohol warms on the tongue and transforms into a thick maltiness of dark bread and brown sugar. Hops are weathered and subtle -- grassy notes pull forward most noticeably. The alcohol is there -- warming but slightly hidden. It takes a while to notice its potent effect. The experience ends on a raisin and brown sugar note with a nip of carbonation that tickles the tip of the tongue. Flavor develops majestically in the background of the palate culminating in near perfection.
Mouthfeel:
Smooth, creamy and slick. Rochefort 10 is medium to full-bodied and lush. Clearly, the exquisite mouthfeel was crafted by skilled hands and tempered minds
Drinkability:
At 11.3 % it would be dubious at best to recommend drinking too many of these. And yet, the alcohol is subtly sublimated beneath the transfixingly deep, sweet flavors that pervade the liquid. I want another, need another, and yet know I should not have another. 1,786 charactersBeerNemesis, Mar 22, 2010

Smell: Obvious smell of alcohol mixed with dried fruits and just a hint of malted sweetness.
Taste: Very complex flavor which mixes sweet dried fruits and spices up front. Hints of malt and caramel in the middle and just a hint of something medicinal. The alcohol is fairly strong at the finish and provides a nice warming sensation.

Drinkability: Very high drinkability, especially considering the very high ABV. This is one to drink slowly and savor.

A: Pours a muddy brown color, with a ton of sediment. Yeast floating all over this one. An average off white head appears and leaves some impressive spotty lace.
A: Big sweet malt profile. Sweet fruit, candy, and earthy hops. Pretty darn spot on for the style.
T: Follows the nose quite well. Very sweet, big malts, candied figs, currants, and more sweet bread. This has to be a pretty fresh bottle, as it is very hot. The alcohol shows up in a big way. Finishes rather boozy.
M: Creamy, with a bite. Carbonation is not lacking here.
D and overall impression: Drinkability would be better if this was aged a little. Again, I think I had a pretty fresh bottle, I would really like to see what this one is like with about 6 months to a year on it. But overall, a very nice example of the style. Skal. 878 charactersGtreid, Mar 19, 2010

The nose is a truck load of perfectly ripe fruit fresh from the picking with yeast and a light sour tartness on the nose. The palate love this beer. Incredibly smooth and balanced with dark cherry sweetness up front followed by a tart yeast finish. There is very little alcohol present which is amazing since it is 11.3%. Amazing beer. I will cellar my other bottle for a great deal of time. God bless the belgians. 570 characterstippebrewcrew2, Mar 19, 2010
4.92/5  rDev +10.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5This is my very first beer review. I have been sampling and buying craft beer for about a month and a half now. Since that time, I have tried 18 of the world's top 100 - and many more. I figured I would start with my favorite beer in the world. 
The appearance is wonderful - a deep mahogany with tones of purple, the obvious result of the dark fruits. Bits of brown and orange-ish settlement float at the top of the beer and stain the brew's head. 
The smell is equally amazing. I can't pretend that I can identify each note, but slightly fruity and sweet with the slightest note of alcohol. 
The taste is awesome, but I use this word with it's proper intent - awe-inspiring; in an old testament sort of way. The notes that I can identify are the dark fruits and the chocolate or caramel. As the beer warms, the alcohol finish becomes stronger.
The mouthfeel is smooth, creamy and slightly frothy.
Only the slightest of alcohol burns as the beer warms.

4.63/5  rDev +3.6%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5The much heralded Rochefort 10. Perhaps no other beer in the world is so easy to obtain yet so exquisite.
Pours a dark midnight brown with a tall off white head leaving lacing all over the place. there is a good amount of yeast dregs floating around the glass. This is almost mouth watering.
The nose gives hints of sliced apples, leading into a earthy flavor that in my mind i always imagine as minerals, maybe from the water source as i notice this in a lot of Belgians. Other subtle fruits like fig and pear give a whisper but not as pronounced as some other quads. Some alcohol heat which i find very attractive and a welcome compliment to the other flavors. 
There was a good crisp "psss" when i popped the cap, so i knew there would be nice carbination, and it was a prefect amount. A medium body compliments the flavors nicely.
This is a long time sipping beer, not because its too hot, or not easy to drink, but because it's the only way to properly do it justice. After finishing one of these, almost anything else you could grab would not seem appealing....unless it was a second Rochefort. Well done Monks. 1,121 charactersChadQuest, Mar 16, 2010
4.62/5  rDev +3.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a murky dark brown with visible sediment settling down. It has slight orange highlights with a thin and lacy off white head. The aroma is sweet with a nose of grains, dark fruits, and a smooth candied background. The drink is smooth and has a big malty sweet and vinous flavor. There are also flavors of caramel, dark fruits, and nutty grains which blend together in a great complex mix. The body is moderately light with moderate carbonation which allows the complexity to dance around the palate. The finish is sweet and warming as it slowly fades to gentle end. 570 charactersmanahansf, Mar 16, 2010

Pours a dark mahogany brown. I got some of the yeastie floaties in there but that's ok for a person that understands how this beer is made. A BMC drinker wouldn't like it. Thin tan head dissapated to a ring. No visable lacing.
Aroma is awesome. Lots of caramel and Belgian candy. Little bit of dark fruits.
The dark fruits come through a little bit more in the taste but also alot of creme brûlée-ish toasted sugar. Very tasty.
Mouthfeel is nice and dry for all the complexity. High carbonation.
Overall an amazing beer that deserves an awesome score. Non hyped, just tasty goodness in a glass 713 charactersPeprSprYoFace, Mar 12, 2010

4.5/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.25Decided to splurge today at Armsby Abbey and get one of the beers on the cellar list, which is a 2006 bottle of this beer. I have had this before but not aged. Poured into the Rochefort goblet, very proper. Poured dark brown with plenty of expected sediment, nice off-white head sticks around pretty well. Smell is huge on this one, excellent and strong. A really great raisin/booze scent. Tastes include raisin, figs, rich chocolate truffle, brown sugar, spice, booze, plum. Maybe the most noticeable thing about the aged bottle compared to a new one is the mouthfeel, much creamier and less harsh on the alcohol. The alcohol taste that is there is very warm and comforting on the stomach. A truly great beer to sip and savor but it's hard to because it tastes so great. The last few sips are full of yeast. At the bar I paired it with some excellent yogurt with cranberries, granola and nuts and while enjoying them they played "Black Out" by Pavement and I was pretty much in heaven. 986 charactersChico1985, Mar 06, 2010
4.44/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5My new favorite beer! That says it all. The only downside to this beer is that I don't know how to pronounce it. It pours very dark and is more carbonated than the beers that I usually like (DIPA). It smells and tastes of chocolate and warms you right up inside. The beer only gets better as you drink it and as it warms. I found myself disappointed that I had only bought one bottle. Anyone who is getting their "good beer" career started should definitely pick this one up, it does not disappoint. If you've never had a quad, I would probably recommend not starting with this, because I'm not sure it gets much better. Cheers! 628 charactersantoines15, Mar 04, 2010
4.12/5  rDev -7.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Served in a Chimay goblet.
Pours a nearly opaque dark walnut with almost a finger of ecru head that leaves a minimal amount of lacing behind. The smell is delightfully sweet, with notes of figs, chocolate, plums, vanilla, brown sugar, molasses, and wheat coming through and blending nicely. The taste follows, with the molasses, figs, vanilla, and brown sugar coming through strongest. At the surprisingly (but not overly) dry finish a final sugary sweetness pries its way forward, a fitting end. The body is medium, bordering on heavy, moves fizzily smoothly over the tongue, and does not sloggingly cover the mouth, allowing this brew to be highly sippable and enjoyable. 674 charactersTMoney2591, Feb 28, 2010
4.46/5  rDev -0.2%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4A - I'm assuming the carbonation is natural, and it's huge. Dirty dark brown pour with sediment floating around, some of it a bit chunky. Moderate dissipation with a little sticky lacing on the sides. Great looking, very natural looking beer.
S - Malty, a little biscuity, dark fruits, alcohol. Smells sweet, kind of a brown or cane sugar smell in there.
T - I am unexperienced with quads, so was worried I wouldn't like this or know what I was drinking. No worry there, at least on the liking it part. Fantastic. Molassas, raisins, a light touch of honey, dark fruit, sugar, and some nice malt. Alcohol cuts through it like a knife, but the sharpness really just helps to balance out the sweetness.
M - Highly carbonated, medium to a little heavy. Warming in the mouth, which definately continues to the stomach.
D - Tastes so good it's easy to drink, and the carbonation helps, but the warmness in my stomach from the alcohol lets me know this isn't one I'm going to be knocking back all night. I will however, drink it enough to the point where I"m nicely drunk, just not sessionable. 1,091 charactersAgentZero, Feb 28, 2010
4.57/5  rDev +2.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5I live in the U.S.A. and cut my teeth on mass produced beer. I didn't and maybe still don't get all the craft beer hype. But, I just finished one of your 10's and went on line to read some reviews others have posted. Maybe I'm thick but I can't see how they get so much wordage out of a beer, Christ knows it's beer you like or you don't. I liked this one a lot, in fact it's the first one of the 6 or 8 craft beers I have ever tried that I didn't think afterwords why'd I pay a much higher price for that. I know what I like without over thinking it and your beer was very good no Great!

4.72/5  rDev +5.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5My first real beer from Belgium, one of my friends brought this back to the U.S. for me. About three months old, a real treat, can't wait to try it. 
Pours a dark mahogany color with maroon highlights and tiny pieces of sediment snowing down from a finger of off-white, creamy head. Not a lot of retention, but that's expected from a beer with this much alcohol content. Still, it leaves some pretty nice rings of lacing around the glass. 
10 brings a distinct dark quality to the table in the nose. I can smell a bold, slightly spiced blend of several different dark fruits as well as a melty caramel aspect. A brief waft of alcohol, though somewhat diminished by a bit of aging, works well with the sweet and slightly spicy nose, reminding me of rum and scotch in a way. Very fragrant and interesting nose on this one. 
The taste is truly exceptional. Up until this point, I had only had American interpretations of Belgian beers, and although they're good, this is the real deal. Sweet, dark raisins and plums show up in the beginning, then get overtaken by a gooey mixture of molasses and caramel. The beer finishes slightly sweet and alcoholic, again reminding me of a smooth rum. Although these flavors show up in stages, many of them linger and pass into the spotlight when others are on stage, creating an amazingly complex and intriguing flavor. 
Trappistes Rochefort 10 has a body that is a few notches over medium and when coupled with some mild carbonation (some CO2 probably faded over time), a silky smooth, creamy mouthfeel is produced. The alcohol provides a slight warmth in the finish that makes this very pleasant to sip, especially on a cool night like tonight. 
This is perhaps the most drinkable Belgian I've had, I really would love to punish several bottles of this in a sitting, but there are two problems. The high ABV, and the fact that I only have one bottle. Still, this is now my favorite Belgian and one of the best beers I think I've ever had; I consider myself lucky to have had the opportunity to try a beer of this one's merit so early along in my beer-drinking career. 2,109 charactersfeelmefoam, Feb 27, 2010

A - Very dark brown color. Nice three finger head with a light brown color.
S - Very malty with slight buttery hints , possibly raisins, and a faint alcohol smell.
T - Malty, a sugary mix of raisins and light caramel undertones with a sweet taste of alcohol.
M - This is one heck of a smooth beer that goes down easy with a slight alcohol kick.
D - I could drink this all night if it wouldn't put me down after a few. This is a fantastic find in a state that is hard to find more than a handful of tasty brews.

a - Pours a dark brown with about one finger of a tan/brown head and a lot of carbonation. Very similiar pour to Rochefort 8 the difference being this pours with a lot of sediment evident throughout the glass.
s - Smells of sweet fruits and malts, as well as a little bread and yeast. No alcohol smell evident. I personally think it smells better and sweeter than the Rochefort 8 did.
t - Sweet fruits and malts again are the big taste. Also small amounts of bready malts, spices, and alcohol. It's a little sweeter than the 8.
m - Medium body with a lot of carbonation. Very similiar to 8.
d - Overall I thought this was a great Quad. Considering it is 11.3% ABV, you really can't tell. I really enjoyed the sweet fruit/malt smell and taste and though it was much better than the Rochefort 8. Will definitely be trying again. 926 charactersmdfb79, Feb 24, 2010

Menthol hops, phenols in there, and Christmas spice burst at the end before tightening. Oily and very round, medium body. Significant burn.
Complex and deep, but just too hot. 
This bottle is less than a year from bottling, and I understand it ages well, so I'd be curious to try a cellared bottle. Now, though, drinkability needs to take a hit.

S - Lots of dark fruit and rum scents, along with a bit of spiciness (both from alcohol and spices)
T - Full of dark, run-soaked fruit (raisin, plum, fig, dark cherry). There is also a good amount of spiciness to it with peppery and clove flavors (amongst others). Really reminds me of a Christmas Pudding, which is a good thing. Good balance of those sweetish/fruit flavors and a full bready feel. This beer has a warming effect but the alcohol is pretty well hidden.

D - Really good beer for sipping. Might not be one that I would drink more than one a night, but one that I would definitely drink again.

Pours mahogany brown in color with loads of beige, frothy head. The foam is retained pretty much throughout the drink with lots of lacing. Some haze/yeast particles visible in the brew.
Lots caramel and malt on the nose, some Belgian yeast aroma and sweet and doughy as well. There are some spice notes prevalent.
Taste is very spicy up front, lots of clove and yeast flavor. Tons of malt in there too as cereal and biscuit flavors. A bit sweet, which complements the spiciness well. Decently strong alcohol warmth at the end, with notes of licorice, cherry, and raisin.
Full body and medium sweetness, but it's not overpowering. The mouthfeel is a bit on the thick or creamy side. An overall smooth and tasty beer, especially considering the high ABV on this one. 783 charactersgoldbot, Feb 14, 2010

Deep brown, half inch of tan/white head. Dissipates, plenty of lacing.
Very complex and delightful. Nose of caramel corn and butter, some spices and hints of dried fruits like prunes. Really exciting to smell, and brings a great dimension to the experience.
Warm and creamy, the beer opens with slightly sweet malt and dried fruits including prunes and strawberry jam. Butter and toast is next, with hints of toffee and caramel. A slight bit of spice at the end balances against the complexities up to this point.
Full bodied with plenty of carbonation. Well balanced and shows plenty of character. Worth it all.
(FWIW - I did a side-by side with St. Bernardus Abt 12 for fun when I had this beer. In my opinion, they're rather close, and it's hard to pick a fav. I'll go with Rochefort by a clean margin, with the caveat that one who likes more fruit in their beer will lean towards the St. Bernardus. As a wine drinker [mainly] I'm very attracted to the subtle and warm approach to the Rochefort. To each their own, though.) 1,054 charactersBillyBoysPie, Feb 13, 2010
4/5  rDev -10.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Pours a very dark cloudy brown with a small head, but that was probably due to a careful pour to prevent agitating of the eyast sediment in the bottle, but it swirls up okay and leaves some creamy lacing on the glass.
Smells huge and great. Fresh apples, really juicy, apples are also present in the way of applepie, with cinnamon and carramellized sugar. On top of the apples there are slight hints of milk chocolate and red berries, sweet.
Taste is rich, but much as in the blue Chimay I drank earlier this evening the yeast esters are overpowering, which I cant understand since it has stood undisturbed for days and I was really careful with the pour... And I remember drinking this beer without the yeast being this overpowering, it clouds out all the interesting flavours and hints of flavours that I remember being here.
Anyway, what the yeast does not drown out totally is nice, red berries, apples, chocolate and almond icing coupled with a hint of plums and port, but as mentioned, it's hard to enjoy it with this massive bland flavour-curtain of yeast in the front of it. The beer finishes surprisingly dry, despite the light sweetness throughout the rest of the taste.
Mouthfeel is luxiurous and smooth with very light belgian carbonation. 1,254 charactersdqrull, Feb 13, 2010

A: The first thing I note in this beer is that the head is literally perfect - as in it can not be improved. Thick with excellent lacing - it could pass for whipped cream. Dark brown, with a bit of amber hue.
S: The first thing I get is strong belgian sugar, or brown sugar - whatever it is, it is delightful. Also a little raisin/plum.
T: A lot of great stuff going on here - dark fruits, sugar, and incredible balance. Maybe a bit of caramelized sugar - just enough alcohol taste, but not enough for you to realize this beers power.
M/D: Smooth and creamy - like the perfect milkshake, or...beer. Very strong, and one will certainly be enough - and this was perfectly paired with a good cheese plate. 867 charactersJesstyr, Feb 12, 2010

Drank it for the first time a few months ago. Poored into the Rochefort chalice (purchased in Brussels). drank at about 60 F. 
A: Very murky brown poor with a nice tan head. The foam cap will stay there the entire time you drink it. The head will not spill over no matter how fast you poor (33cl glass).
S: Rich, strong, somewhat fruity smell of figs and raisins and maybe plums with a good dose of alcohol.
T: Extremely smooth and full of flavor. Fruity taste at first then a decent hidden amount of alcohol towards the end.
M: Wow, where to start. The carbonation is perfect. Thick and very warming due to the alcohol, but still maintains a very fruity mild taste. 
D: A supreme beer. Just as good if not better than the Westy 8. Truly an epic beer. My personal favorite as of right now... 834 charactersCalyps0, Feb 12, 2010
4.53/5  rDev +1.3%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5330ml bottle poured into a chalice.
Pours a dark redish brown with more than a finger of slightly tanned head and very solid retension. (I don't think I have ever had a beer in my life, not on nitro, that I could drink over a duration of more than 40 minutes and still have a cap of foam up to the very last sip.) Thick coating of lace sticks to the glass with every taste. Very sweet smelling aroma of dark fruit. It has something about it in the nose along the lines of like candied plums and a little bit of breadiness and brown sugar or maple syrup. Tail end of the aroma has some of the alcohol coming through and just a tiny bit of citrus. Taste has quite a bunch of stuff going on. It is very malty and sweet taste upfront that is like alcohol laden dark fruit and caramel. Little bit of bitterness and breadiness in the drying finish. Alcohol isn't hidden, it shows off in both the warmth of this beer and also plays a significant role in the way this beer tastes. The amount of alcohol isn't distracting, it actually enhances both the aroma and the taste, very well done. Medium bodied and has a perfect amount of carbination. 
This beer was a wonderful experience and if you never had it, you should put it on your to do list. 1,238 charactersstakem, Feb 11, 2010

Appearance: rich, slightly ruddy brown with lots of haze and several fingers of tan head. It looks good like a quadrupel should!
Smell: rich, bready malt with subtle fruitiness along the lines of raisin and plum. It's very good, though I do feel like it could have the volume turned up just a hair.
Taste: extremely rich malt flavors. Brown bread, plums, cherries and alcohol are all evident in the flavor; these all mesh extremely well. I must say I'm a big fan of the Rochefort 10.
Mouthfeel: excellent creamy texture. What more do I need to say?
Drinkability: while quadrupels are tasty, I typically would not call them eminently drinkable because of their strong flavors and high ABVs. Rochefort 10, however, gets exceedingly high marks because it provides a great flavor profile without being over-taxing on the palate. Cheers! 876 charactersflagmantho, Feb 10, 2010

T-a nice sweetness and fruityness to the beer ith notes of dark fruit raisins and a nice earthness to the beer their isnt much hop presence at all but an amazingly complex taste with a nice dose of alcohol that is rather well hidden 
M-a rather heavy body which a fair amount of carbonation makes it refreshing with the flavor giving this beer a nice full taste
D-definately a sipper but one that is very rewarding it has an amazingly complex taste that os very enjoyable definately not a session beer due to its availability and high abv but an awesome beer none the less 817 charactersjoshstevens87, Feb 07, 2010

The Monks at Abbaye Notre-Dame de Saint-Remy have created a tawny complex ale that rivals any beer. The port-like body bulges with flavor as I took my first sip. As I finished the bottle, the chocolate and fig notes began to coat my palate. 274 charactersSamichlaus85, Feb 06, 2010

4.33/5  rDev -3.1%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Very excited about this one. Ive heard its really close to the westy 12. Initial pour gave way to a thicker head that dissipated rather quickly. Caramel color head over an almost non transparent amber colored brew. Smell of malts and brown sugar.. a very earthy aroma with undertones of the alcohol (not over bearing at all) 
First sip..slight carbonation...smells a bit maltier than it actually tastes. Medium bodied, definite presence of alcohol. Tastes essentially how it smells, floral, malty, delicious
Cheers. 516 charactersalkchrios, Feb 06, 2010

S: Smells strongly of sweet plum, fig and raisins. Also picking up some dried apricot and other candied dried fruit. I am a smoker so I usually don't pick so much in the nose but this is so intense it is impossible not to.
T: Actually getting a tad bit of hops upfront while sweet sugary notes ring out on the backend. Plum and apricot are prominent here. Quite stellar.
M: Pretty much spot on. Just perhaps a tad too warming on the throat.
D: I do like a good Belgian but alas most are too sweet for me to want to drink lots of. It eventually gets to you. 
I am always torn whether I prefer the Dubbel or the Quad. Drinking this will make me prefer the Quad all the time. This is an exceptional beer. There is a reason why you will never find a better Belgian outside of Belgium. 1,001 charactersgeneralnotsew, Feb 05, 2010

S: Very fragrant, spicy...dates, brown sugar, pecans...
T: Very smooth and full of flavor, the dates and sugar smells are quite present in the taste, I also taste a very faint hint of citrus. The alcohol taste is present on the swallow, but otherwise is muted.

4.35/5  rDev -2.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Presented lightly chilled and poured into my Tripel Karmeliet tulip, Trappistes Rochefort 10 is hazy burnt chestnut in color with four fingers of pale beige foam atop. The towering head recedes slowly into a misshapen pillow, its grainy bubbles consolidating themselves into larger spongiform masses that deposit drooping rails of fluffy lacing onto the sides of the glass.
The aroma is spicy-sweet, with pungent notes of brandy-soaked dried figs, sticky dates, brown sugar and savory ripe banana. A splash of citrus and a waft of fresh green grass freshen the dark sugariness of the profile.
The taste is silken caramel with hints of mushy dates and overripe figs. Cooling alcohol is mild and fruity and adds a drying edge to counterract an overarching sweetness that otherwise might turn syrupy, but contributes immediate liquory warming to the innards of the drinker. A touch of yeasty banana becomes increasingly evident as the brew warms further.
The drink is silky-smooth and a bit too lightly carbonated, but sports a rich medium-fullish body that coats the palate with lingering slippery efficiency. This tasty treat is quite an excellent sipper for a cool winter evening. 1,183 characterscvstrickland, Feb 02, 2010

4.67/5  rDev +4.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from 330mL bottle into Ommegang tulip
A - Opened with a POP and poured a deep dark ruby reddish brown with a generous bubbly head and lively carbonation. Lacing slipped down the glass with a little bit clinging to the side.
S - Dark fruit medley. Apples jump out first followed by grape, fig and malty sweetness with a hint of alcohol.
T - A very well balanced medley of spices with some dark fruit flavors. The flavor has a lot going on and is very complex, but very even tasting and the alcohol content is hardly noticeable compared to other quads I've had (although you can certainly tell that it is there). Really great example of the style...strong and subtle at the same time. I'm a big fan of Ommegang's 3 Philosophers and this beer is a little less in your face which is really nice.
M - Smooth and thick. Very rich and syrup like with good carbonation and a tingly moist bready after taste. The alcohol is hidden really well in this one.
D - Very nicely balanced quad...extremely drinkable and delicious. 1,025 characterscosmicevan, Jan 28, 2010

S- The smell of this beer is amazing. Caramel, fresh bread, some dark fruits and even ripe bananas. Some alcohol and phenol smell in the background, but dominated by sweet maltiness.
T- Very sweet malt presence, kola nut, bananas and caramel in the front, finishes with booze and cloves. Minimal bitterness. Becomes much more alcohol forward as it warms up. 
M- Medium body with a lot of fizzy carbonation. Creamy finish.
D- A great beer for sure. A perfect example of a quad, although once it warmed up i did not enjoy it as much because the alcohol was that much more noticeable. As a side note, I used some of this bottle to replace the cognac in a steak au poivre sauce as well... a great pairing for sure. 850 charactersnkersten, Jan 27, 2010

T- just like the nose...dark raisins, browns sugar, molasses, tobacco, cola, nuttiness & some rum like booze.
M- Moderate body with not sharp carbonation that works throughout the swallow. Some rsidual sugar on the tongue.

Murky brown with a beige head that stayed as a light layer leaving a few bits of lacing.

I've kept it in the cellar for a special occasion. After 3 years, I'm ready to imbibe. I'll be pouring into an official "Trappistes Rochefort" gold-rimmed chalice.
A: Upon popping the top, I hear the sound of CO_2 releasing, and a mist hovers around the top of the bottle for about 30 seconds. Pours perfectly with a dark reddish-brown hue and about a quarter inch rim of head, with plenty of little yeasty deposits at the bottom.
S: Dried dark fruit (something like prunes), malts, dark chocolate, and just a hint of the alcohol (but not overpowering)
T: A tiny spice to start, chestnuts, brown sugar, dates, white chocolate, then slightly burnt cloves, and banana to finish.
MF: Carbonation tingles at first touch, then creamy, and a smooth but acidic finish.
D: I'll definitely have another. Not tonight though - a perfect nightcap. Now I'm going to smoke my pipe. Life is grand. 969 charactersguitarninja, Jan 24, 2010

Poured into standard pint glass. This beer is very carbonated! Got about a full inch of head with a normal pour. The smell is spices, dark fruit, and some sugary sweetness. Very inviting. The taste is amazing! very complex and smooth. Hard to describe all the tastes going on here, but I get many of the flavors in the smell, and others I can't identify. I am somehow reminded of cotton candy while drinking this, which is strange for a beer and doesn't sound good, but trust me it is. Mouthfeel is good, lots of carbonation, you will notice a bit of solid residue on your tongue once in a while. Drinkability is fine, definitely some alcohol taste going on though. 868 characterspdoran10, Jan 23, 2010

The smell is very unique. It smells like you popped open a fresh bottle of cabaret. Complex and very, very wine-like the nose speaks complexity in a big way. Raisins, spice, figs, sticky dates and caramel are just a few of the aromas you can pull from this nose.
Cocoa and caramel play a prominent role in the taste as does raisins and wood. This beer is complex and I've barely tried it. Specifics include Cabernet casks, Brandy barrels, fermented grapes, cocoa powder, jammed apples and apricots and it goes on and on. Very powerful, complex, tasty Quad.
Mouthfeel is up there and almost perfect for the style. What a beer, plenty of bubbles yet creamy, crisp and fulfilling on the tongue. 
Completely lives up to the hype, much better than ABT 12 and deserves all accolades. What a beer! 924 charactersnatelocc787, Jan 20, 2010

S: Sweet, fruity, with a malty flavor. The smell is strong and has alot of plum/raison in it. A small hint of alcohol in the smell.
T: A nice strong dark fruit flavor that doesn't overwhelm. It's got abit of spice on the back end and there's no sign of hops. Taste matches the smell completely.
M: It's a rich, smooth, medium-full bodied beer. There's some nice underlying heat from the alcohol but not too much. Nice carbonation as well.
D: Easily the most drinkable beer over 10% I've ever had. This beer is no sipper and can be drank with relative ease. 602 characterstuckevalastin, Jan 18, 2010

A: Great looking beer. It pours a real deep brown, very dense. it has a 1-finger head that just... sits there. The lacing is pretty much "OMG!" awesome. It sticks to the glass, and it absolutely refuses to go away.
S: Hm... malty is the best way to put it, but it's far more COMPLEX than that. Sweeter smell of sugar meets sharper smell of dark fruits and the alcohol underneath. Good smelling, but nothing that makes me go "whoa."
T: Well, this made me go "whoa!" Super on every level. It's got depth... a lot of it, too. There's the sweetness of the sugar and cocoa, but there's so much more to it. There are dark fruits like plum, as well. The sweetness is so well-balanced... I don't know if I can call anything except perfect.
M: Good, thick body with nice carbonation. Complements the beer really well. The alcohol seeped in, though. I'm not going to complain, I'm to busy saying "om nom nom." Second one I tried, I didn't get that alcohol at all, making it perfect. Just perfect. 
D: Why, oh why, did I only buy one bottle? Seriously, given the high content of the alcohol, I don't think I'll find a more drinkable beer out there.
Overall/notes: Monks rule. I don't even know if I have anything else to say. Anyone who can brew a beer like this deserves a hug... or at least a high-five. That's only if the hug isn't desired, though. I've seen the top of the beer, and it is Trappistes Rochefort 10, you beautiful brew, you. 1,551 charactersbbkd3b, Jan 18, 2010

12 oz. Bottle, poured into a chalice.
Appearance: Dark brown, almost opaque with a tiny amount of coagulated protein & yeasty dandruff floating. Head is composed of extremely tiny, tighly packed bubbles, it rises about a quarter inch high and stays put. Lacing is nearly solid. 
Odor: Spice from the yeast, soft perfumy fruity alcohol, complimented by plum-like dark caramel malt aromas. 
Consistency: Solid carbonation makes this beer feel light and airy on the palate, with some slight acidity around the edges, though there's definitely a medium-ish bodied feel to this beer.
Flavor: Snappy yeast derived pepper comes in waves, holding back the sweetness, dark fruit, carob and fill out the background. Alcohol nips at the tongue ever so slightly, finish is dry and clean, leaving a some fruit and soft chocolate flavors behind.
Classic for a reason. They've had years to develop their recipe/technique and it shows. Mouthfeel/carbonation is delightful, allowing the richer qualities not to overwhelm the palate. The spice notes from the yeast do their part in balancing. even in this two year old bottle of beer. 1,176 charactersWalken, Jan 14, 2010

5/5  rDev +11.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Strong Dark Belgian ale, type Trappist. Quad seems not to be a recognized style. Anyway not a style for newbies and maybe not for everyone.
A: excellent head retention, nice creamy 1.2 inches of head even with the yeast poured into the glass. Sadly many do not know how to serve this beer, or even how to correctly pour it. Lucky for me I seen in done first hand many times. Dark candy in color a true caramel in color, I do not have any yeast in mine yet.
The lacing sticks to the glass when you take a drink. Its as great as Trappist Westvleteren.
S: so complex, so rich in a mix of great blends of plum like aroma, you can get a bit of candy sugar. as it warms you get the sweet malt, and some alcohol as it warms even more. Its a strong beer so if you not used to or do not like alcohol well don't drink this beer. You have to develop not only a taste for this semi sweet strong brew, but it helps if you can drink and enjoy whiskey straight up, of course its not that strong a brew, but I remember my first, it hit me strong, but I was lucky the alcohol was a big turn on for me. Anyway the beer is so good and while its slightly different from a westy its just as good, its just different.
T: well I love this blend of plums, grapes, so complex the great malt sweetness is so good. it has no hops detectable which means a perfect balance. great beer. rich in taste, warms you up in winter time or anytime. Its my go too beer thank goodness you can buy it in any grocery store for less than 2 euro usually. nothing better than being able to drink this everyday, for not allot, in the states this is 6 plus in stores, if you can find it. this beer also ages well, but I really do not care to wait.
m: rich, medium body, some alcohol warming to the back of the mouth, throat. very enjoyable.
D: strong beer that is easy to drink, but its almost criminal to drink too many of these at 1 time, though I have kicked back 4 to 5 before. So its easy to drink, heck keep them semi cold and you can get hammered in no time. I would not recommend it, but some days in Belgium its fun to get a nice buzz, its always a easy walk back. anyway enjoy this.
I think this and even the pannepot to be the best in this style, that to rank 1 above the other is just silly imho. 2,268 charactersazorie, Jan 07, 2010

Aroma is very sweet with raisin and plum as the dominant aromas. Just a hint of alcohol warmth. It's a bit similar to the 8 in regards to how appealing the aroma is.
Taste is sweet with a hint of caramel, plum and raisin flavors. Very subtle and delicious. 
Mouthfeel is full of lingering plum and raisin. The most surprising thing is that this beer is 11.3% and doesn't even taste like it. 
What can I say? I probably shouldn't review the 8 and 10 back to back but I believe that the 10 is even better than the 8, despite a slight deviation in style. It's even more deceptively drinkable and proof that the monks know what they're doing. Pick it up! 788 charactersBrad007, Jan 05, 2010

In the mouth, body, heady, sweet as strongly for the Rochefort 8, but it feels even more the presence of fruit soaked in alcohol and at times one begins to think of a port. Some notes accompanying fruity flavor. The finish is long but a slight lack of balance in relation to the Rochefort 8 is noteworthy. Beer complex. 425 charactersThaCreep, Jan 02, 2010
4.26/5  rDev -4.7%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4For all its acclaim, Trappistes Rochefort 10 is a slight disappointment. It is, in all respects, a very good beer. But it is only unbelievable, phenomenal in one regard, appearance. And in my opinion, appearance is the least significant of the criterion.
A &#8211; Deep chestnut brown, perfect cream-colored head. This beer looks absolutely perfect.
S &#8211; Cinnamon with no sugar, slight lactic, surprisingly mellow on the olfactory, overall.
T &#8211; Raisins and figs, richness and smoothness as an overwhelming quality, then a warm alcohol and slightly bready and fruity ester, with a clean bitter hop finish. A bit of a vodka aftertaste. Still, not top-of-the-world status, not even T.O.N.Y., likely. But I like it. Its just not worth $6 a beer, in my opinion.
M &#8211; Warm, bordering on hot. Medium-thin body with a clean, dry finish.
D &#8211; Too expensive to justify the cost / benefit ratio. But it drinks well. 930 charactersktrillionaire, Jan 01, 2010

A: Dark, woody brown with wispy, creamy cap of beige head. Leaves uneven lacing around the goblet.
S: Oaky, nutty, fruity, yeasty, and herbal all at once. Dark fruit aromas meet nutty yeast with some woody, herbal hops aromas. There is a tickle of alcohol on the nostrils.
T: The nose reflects the flavor profile pretty solidly as dark fruits like raisin, dark cherry, and dates combine seamlessly with nutty yeast flavors and finish with earthy, woody, herbal hops notes. Alcohol is not detectable except for the fruitiness of this brew. Surprising for the freshness of this bottle.
M: Thinner than imagined with active carbonation. Drinks very easily because of the smaller body. Aftertaste is dark fruit and nutty, woody notes.
D: Drinkability and smoothness are off the charts for a beer with such a high ABV that is so young. The malt complexities in the aroma and flavor are staggering, and it is a complete brew in that yeast, hops, and malt all get their day. 1,131 charactersargock, Jan 01, 2010
4.08/5  rDev -8.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4A foray into a class of beers I am just beginning to truly understand, but already love.
This poured majestically with a nearly uncontrollable head, highly laced and tan in color, glistening almost. Deep mahogany color in the beer with just a slight touch of reds around the edges of the glass.
Aromas of fig, black cherry, highly alcoholic nose. A little spicy, peppery even.
Rich, complex flavor. Very spicy and malty, with a resonating cherry flavor. Slight, if not unnoticable bitterness from hops. The finish is..settle down, 10!!! The alcohol just burns on the finish, relegating a fantastic flavor into an orgy of over-alcoholed tastebuds.
The feel is explosive, bubbly and crisp, creamy all at the same time.
I truly believe that while this is a fantastic beer, there is just a line crossed of too much alcohol presence and not enough hiding. And to drink this is a task. Not a chore, but a task. 909 characterscnally, Dec 31, 2009
4.25/5  rDev -4.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 411.2 oz bottle poured into my over sized St. Bernardus goblet.
A dark opaque brown that leaves a small off-white head that laces moderately in clumps, but dissipates quite quickly. I had the hardest time discerning a particular scent I was picking up, but then I read through a few reviews and then finally the Bros review and there it was, melon. It has a clear, clean, and fresh melon scent to it, along with a sweet sugary smell, and just a slight bit of alcohol in the back.
I think I may have hurt myself, this one is really making me think. Unlike the Rochefort 8 that just had me saying, "wow," this one is great, but in a different way. I think the extra abv may mask some of the flavors you'd find in the 8 or in other BSDA's. The alcohol is a bit more present in this brew, but it's still a deceptively easy beer to drink. It's velvety smooth, with just the right amount of carbonation. It's a bread like, malty beer. A bit medicinal due to the high abv, but that imparts a slight, very very slight smokiness. Some fruity esters, produces a bit of a grape flavor. 1,075 charactersoskoreien, Dec 30, 2009

It pours a hazy, barely translucent, dark coppery brown with a very thick and pale tan head. Flavor is malty and fruity with a hint of caramel and a fierce but not overwhelming alcohol bite. Texture is very smooth, yet quite fizzy and tingly, leaving a satisfying and lip-smacking finish with fruity and caramel hints as well as a touch of sweetness. 425 charactersCyberkedi, Dec 28, 2009

S-rum covered fruits, toffee, nuts, malt, brown sugar, a little bit of honey
T-brown sugar and candied fruit sweetness upfront with a warming alcohol at the end of the sip, a nice toasty pecan or something flavor comes through sometimes; has the slightest amount of hops at the end along with the alcohol--the nutty flavors, for me, are more apparent as it warms
M-best mouthfeel i've ever had in a beer, maybe any type of drink. very smooth and velvety
D-at 11.3% it's a strong beer and it's expensive; for me it's a once-in-awhile type beer usually saved for special occasions and with its alcohol content, one in a night is enough for me 772 charactersscottyb88, Dec 28, 2009

4.82/5  rDev +7.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5330 ml poured into Rochefort chalice, BBE says 07.10.2014. Considering that the BBE date on the bottle is five years from production, the beer is quite fresh one. 
Cap removal releases vinous scent that instantly vaporizes without a trace. The caramel/dark muddy brown fluid topped by semi-stable tan head that slowly collapses into thin solid cap is turbid due to dispersed tiny yeast particles. Head retreating & glass swirling produces patches of delicate lace on the walls. Aroma profile comprises cocoa with cane sugar, dates and all-present mustiness of decomposing tree-leaves covering the humid soil of late November woods and that earthy scent makes Rochefort such a primeval brew. Alcohol breaks through but is far enough from being overpowering.
Flavors are dominated by milk chocolate with roasted almonds sweetened with caramelized sugar. Fully ripened dates adding more sweetness are the solitary representatives of the heavenly orchard.Faint bread crust bitterness and moderate alcohol warmth balance the chocolaty-sweet aspects of the beer completing the circle. Besides all the sweetness and warmth a ponderous Earth element reigns: Something rotten, woody, musty and old as Earth is lurking beneath to grab the lonely wanderer. This beer holds a dark secret. Rochefort 10 is a complex brew yet so obviously based on simple recipe - not surprisingly as the best things in our lifes are the simplest ones.Richer and musty as Rochefort 6, similar to but stronger (and less carbonated) in every aspect than R8, which, although good, is like R10 diluted with water. It's not nearly as fruity as St. Bernardus Abt.12 and lacks the aristocratic silkiness of Westwleteren which hides the alcohol better and is more refined. Thick malty body is lightly crispy and even so velvety smooth and creamy as it goes down. Apart from mostly unobtrusive alcohol presence the beer is highly enjoyable and very drinkable for such a sheer ale. The monster is still young and somewhat unhewn in terms of mouthfeel and drinkability but who knows what might evolve to taking some nap in the cellar. 2,092 characterscrnipeter, Dec 26, 2009

A: Looks dark copper like an iced tea. Thick 2 inch white head that slowly disippates.
S: Very good smell. Sugary scent with an almost iced tea type scent. Very good smelling.
T: Lots of flavors bouncing around. Can't quite put my finger on each taste. A little more water than expected, but not overwhelming watery taste. 
M: Very good amount of carbonation. A hint too much to be perfect, but very close.
D: This one goes down fairly easy. 
All in all, this is a nice brew. Glad I picked one up. This is a good brew if you're looking for something not as heavy as a stout, but not as light as a standard ale or sweet like a barleywine. This is a thinking beer, if you're looking for a good one to savor and figure out as you sip it. 790 characterssteve8robin, Dec 24, 2009

Poured from a bottle into a goblet, served with yeast (oops). Beer is brown and hazy and some particulates floating in it (my fault its the yeast). Forms a nice thick off white / yellow head that falls away leaving lacing on the glass. Carbonation high. So far so good.
Aroma is a mixture of sweetness and carmel with alcohol and a ton of malt. I think I can smell a slight roast in there as well. Not sure though. Smells pretty good.
Beer is big bodied, no aftertaste at all. There are no hops to detect and bitterness overall is really mild. There is a tinge of alcohol and solvency in the front of the beer and that really disappoints me. Beer gets better and solvency is lessened as the beer warms slightly. Mouthfeel is OK and drinkabiliy is good. I can see how people like this beer but it has not been my favorite Quad. 970 charactersdrabmuh, Dec 23, 2009

A: Very dark with a fluffy eggwhite coloured head which lasts a long time.
S: Dark fruits with a hint of vinegar. As it warms you get lots of alcohol and candy on the nose.
T: Not of this world!!! Very complex with raisins, malt, yeast, candy sugar and lots of chocolate as it gets warmer. Intense... could be heaven in a bottle!
M: Very smooth and creamy with great carbonation. The alcohol is there but never ever becomes overpowering.
D: A definite sipper but a quad that I could sip all night (providing I have enough of them.) I prefer it at room temperature.
This is a complex beer that gets better and better as it warms! 687 charactersBisho, Dec 21, 2009

Turbid brown despite my attempt to keep the yeast out, almost black, flimsy head. It smells like vinegar and pickles at first but as it warms up it becomes sweet candied spices. the flavor has a quad-like sweetness but it also has a strong black licorice quality to it. The alcohol is not blatant but I know it is there because I can feel it. Overall I liked Rochefort 8 more. 440 charactersArrogantB, Dec 20, 2009

Aroma: Bready, some fruitiness, subtle sweetness, almost a wine-like alcohol aroma. Some earthiness, its complex and wonderful, very inviting.
Taste: I'm terrible at describing beers with such complexity. I'm a malt and hops kind of guy, I can tell you all about those two ingredients but this beer seems to continually change on you and puts so many flavors on the palette. Its just incredible. Not what you really think of when you think of beer, its more than that.
Mouthfeel: medium in body, semi-chewy but still feels fairly light, surprising for such a big beer.
Drinkability: Over 11% abv, great for sipping and enjoying, not for poker playing or sports watching really. Still, for such a huge beer, its drinkable.
Just a fantastic beer experience. 843 characterstattooedtolley, Dec 14, 2009
4.97/5  rDev +11.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Appearence-Dark hazy brown with minimal head that leaves some slight lacing along the sides of the glass. The haziness really stands out in this beer's appearence more than the other two Rochefort trappist ales.
Smell-Ahh, heavenly, where do I begin?; rich malty sweetness, herbs, spices, dark brown sugar, maybe some molasses; this beer has it all!
Taste-Is perfect a flavor?; haha, but in all seriousness this beer's flavor absolutely blows me away. It's sweet but not too sweet, peppery and medicinal without being overbearingly so while still contributing to the overall flavor; it exists in a state of perfect flavoral balance and leaves you wanting more with each sip.
Mouth Feel-Thick, heavy and lush while still remaining smooth and easily drinkable; amazing.
Drinkability-This beer is dangerously drinkable for its price and alcohol content, if I could afford and had access to it I wouldn't object to sipping on it all day every day. Very highly drinkable.
Notes-Wow, I adore this beer; it's everything I liked about the #6 and the #8 but combined!, this is my first true Belgian quad and I could not reccomend it more!, and now that's I've tried the Rochefort #10 I can't wait to get my hands on St. Bernardus Abt #12 and Westvleteren #12 1,254 charactersManoftyr, Dec 13, 2009

Pours a deep chestnut brown with ruby and amber highlights. Large fluffy light tan head that fades quickly. Lacing is not too sticky.
One of the richest aromas I've ever encountered in a beer that's noticeable as soon as I crack open the bottle. Sweet rum cake, dates, figs, caramelized sugar, cinnamon, alcohol warmth and spices. It reminds me of an actually good fruit cake that I got from a monastery bakery.
The taste follows the nose but with a more roasted malt character and more spices. Gingerbread, spice cake, the alcohol heat is integrated into the flavor profile and is not overbearing. Very complex and enjoyable. Finishes with a subtle bitterness, smokiness, and spice.
Slick mouthfeel, decently carbonated, but I would kind of like it to be a bit more thick. The flavor is so full and rich that it doesn't seem watery though.
I can't help but drink this relatively quickly. It's just so delicious. The complexity and alcohol effect the drinkability a bit.
Overall, this beer really does deserve all the hype it gets. It probably is actually a little underrated since it is so widely available. 1,231 characterssjccmd, Dec 12, 2009

A: Pours a dark brown color forming a small, creamy, thin bubbled, and beige head. Lots of small chunks can be seen floating inside, in the bottom of the glass. Retention is medium and only few lacings are formed and left in the glass. A thin layer remains for very long on the top
S: Complex. Sweet, grainy, spicy and fruity. Strong notes of dark fruits, mainly figs, raisins and plums. It reminded me a port wine. Strong notes of toffee, caramel malts, candy sugar and Belgium bready yeasts. Strong notes of cereal in the end. Brown bread. A bit of alcohol can be felt in the very end
T: Complex as the smell. Sweet and very malty upfront. Strong notes of dark fruits, toffee, caramel malts, candy sugar, Belgian yeasts, brown bread and spices. Mild hops bitterness profile
M: Full, creamy, heavy and molasses body. Medium carbonation for a 11% ABV beer. Very fruity and malty aftertaste
O: Excellent drinkability. The definition of perfect beer for me 999 characterseduardolinhalis, Dec 04, 2009
4.64/5  rDev +3.8%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5A: Pours a deep mahogany color with a massive beige colored creamy head. Retention is great, and a persistent cap of smooth looking cream remains atop. Lacing on the glass isn't as impressive, but it's still a great looking brew.
S: Aroma is lush and excellent. Fig and raisin, healthy dose of spices, bubblegum, hint of apple, and a rum-like alcohol presence. This is a fantastic aroma. It's not as sweet and vibrant as some others, but it's darkness and complexity are impressive nonetheless.
T&M: A burst of fruitiness, sweet candi sugar, caramel, and toffee start things out. Hops come in midway to bitter things out nicely, and then the finish shows off a delicate cocoa-like malt flavor replete with white pepper and clove spice flavors. This is a complex and wonderful beer. Body is full and creamy, with a subtle carbonation. Great mouthfeel.
D: A top-notch quad. It's massively flavorful and complex. Definitely a contemplative brew one should savor. Despite all that, it's still relatively easy to drink for a quad, as the carbonation level is ideal and the alcohol doesn't interfere with the flavor. 1,113 charactersBamaBeerBuff, Dec 04, 2009
4.35/5  rDev -2.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4330ml bottle poured into Chimay glassware.
A- Dark brown color with a dense, huge head that dissapated after a good amount of time. Very thick head that left me with a nice white moustache. Very very nice to see.
S- I could smell this for days. Seems to change every second as it warms up. Loads of fig/dates, bready yeast, baking spices rounding it all out. The smells are great and you start to appreciate all the work that went into a beer like this, starting with the Belgian spring water and Belgian yeast which are unlike any other.
T- The Belgian yeast comes through right away and is absolutely delicious almost like a soda bread. Figs/dates, raisins, cherries/plums, fruitcake, candied fruits basically with like a oaky sweetness. Finishes with a nice baking spice taste, nutmeg/cinnamon.
M- High carbonation as I drank this right after purchase, however after 1-2 years cellaring I think this will be a almost perfect beer. Right now has tannins and high carbonation=less mouthfeel.
D- Definate sipper, you want to enjoy this beer as it warms/opens up. As it opens you notice that the flavors and smells become much more intense. The high carbonation hinders this beer but after cellaring I'm positive this will be an awesome beer. 1,246 charactersSchmaltzy, Dec 03, 2009

11.3% ABV, Best Before: 30.03.2020
A - Clear-ish brown on the pour this quad becomes a murky dark chestnut in the glass, even when poured sans sediment. Its crowning achievement is the monstrous, dense, cream-colored, three-finger head that's retained quite well though leaving little lace left on the glass.
S - Intoxicating to say the least, this quad's aroma primarily smells of dark fruit esters; the usual suspects are there: candied raisin and plum with a touch of tart cherry skin and finish of gummy bears. Bready and slightly sweet, the maltiness comes through with toast-like nuances only to finish with subtly warming alcohol and fresh tobacco.
T - Though yeast captivates the aroma, the flavor starts with a bready malt backbone with a sprinkle of dark candi sugar sweetness followed closely by an earthy tobacco, woody profile. Dark cherries and blackberries dissolve into milk chocolate-covered raisin and finish out with spritzy carbonation carrying slight spiciness across the palate.
M - Following the 6 and 8 before it, Rochefort 10 is effervescently carbonated and dances on the tongue like champagne, helping to even out the full, malty body. Alcohol does almost the same as it's felt retro-nasally and warming in the stomach but it serves to dry out the finish as well, which leaves this beer dangerously drinkable.
O - Quite an exceptional beer, Rochefort 10 is a glorious culmination of series, each beer getting better and better. This wonderfully malty, dark fruit-laden quad is packed with unending complexity that seems to keep unraveling with each sip as it warms. Age will do the same, transforming this brew quite wonderfully as well. 1,712 charactersBeerFMAndy, Dec 01, 2009

(A)- Pours a cloudy brown/mahogany color with red & purple highlights. Produced a gigantic & thick organic looking eggshell colored fluffy head that is sticking to every inch of the inside of the glass as it slowly dissipated. 
(S)- Yeasty bread & biscuits with crisp banana, lemon, and assorted ripe dark fruits of plum & grape. There might even be a hint of clove or allspice coming through in the yeast. Simply gorgeous fruits on this smell. 
(T)- Delectable plum & grape fruits with banana finishing the deal. Delicious biscuity flavors that morph into a light yeasty clay. Just wonderful complexity and layered goodness. Seamless flavors that make your tastebuds orgasm. Simply mouthwatering.
(M)- Great carbonation level that just barely fizzes on the tongue. An earth-shattering balance; so silky smooth feel. Definitely a multi-dimensional beer that my review (particularly in the taste category) does not even come close to giving it justice. This actually has a rather thick mouthfeel to it, but is so crisp, fruity, and seamlessly layered in those flavors and smoothness that it is barely noticed by myself. Where is the 11.3% abv? Expertly integrated alcohol. Crisp & refreshing.
(D)- A fantastic quad that defines the style. For me, it is the finest belgian I have ever had to date. Gorgeous fruits, body, feel, and balance. Definitely one of the most complex beers as well. The only thing holding me back from giving this perfect 5's is that after one of these kinda makes you feel full, not to mention the alcohol sneaks up on you too. Simply delicious stuff though. 1,651 characterssweemzander, Nov 29, 2009
4.55/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5From 11-22-09 notes.
Tasted in a Dogfish Head Signature Glass.
Rochefort 10 poured a dark brown that was lighter and muddy when held to the light. A one finger off-white head was the result of slow decanting. You can make a beast of a head if you so choose on this or damn near any belgian. The head left no lacing and settled into a thin, island cap. 
In the nose the standout was dark grapes. Raisins were there as well along with a hint of alcohol and the ever present belgian yeast. 
The initial sensation from the first sip comes by way of excellent carbonation. It assaults the palate and weakens its defences for what's to come. After that intial shock there is a familiar spicy, peppery note that gives way to a raisiny body. The finish brings the dark fruits from the nose back into play and also brings back some more peppery goodness. That along with the dry finish leaves the palate in awe of what it has experienced. Alcohol peaks its head in, in the finish, and continues to warm afterwards. There is depth here that I'm not equipped enough to hit on yet but it's enough for me to give this a perfect score on taste. Until I get my hands on Westy this is the standard by which all Quads will be judged. 
Medium bodied, strongly carbonated, palate wrecking. Beautiful. 
This is as drinkable as I would imagine an 11%+ beer to get. I could get in trouble quick with this one if my wallet would allow it. A beautiful beer that sets the tone for all Quads to measure up to. 1,483 charactersabar22, Nov 29, 2009

T-Strong dark fruit and spice on this one, with a subtle caramel note! WOW!
M-Frothy, rocky, crisp, but finishes with a little malt cloy.

Spicy aroma upfront with hints of cinnamon and brown sugar along with black cherry and raisin at the end.
Taste strongly mirrors the smell but still doesn't seem quite as prominent. An initial hit of cinnamon and nutmeg is complimented by the dark fruit tone of sour cherries, raisins and plums Some brown sugar is present throughout, Belgian yeast and more spices come out in the finsh along with just a hint of alcohol. 
Medium bodied and only lightly carbonated. The only low point for me was that the taste seemed just a little underwhelming, but that was only because the aroma was simply amazing...I obviously raised my expectations a little too high after that so I can't really complain. A great sipper for sure and I'll be interested to try this one with a little age on it. 934 charactersVengeance526, Nov 26, 2009

S-Nose is dominated by alcohol, then dark fruits and brown sugar. It smells very sweet with the faintest touch of spice.
T-Very sweet with dark fruits, brown sugar, and very boozy. The alcohol warms the throat and even my chest as it goes down, making this beer feel warm and inviting.
M-Thick, rich, and creamy.
D-Very drinkable even given the high abv. This is definitely a sipper.
Overall, honestly I am disappointed. I read a thread recently that talked about how great this beer was. I then checked its spot on the top 100 and it was in the low 20s I believe. I would say it belongs at about that spot. To me this beer lacks complexity and depth compared to St. Bernardus Abt 12. However, this is a must try for all lovers of the style. 877 charactersthegodfather2701, Nov 25, 2009

T: Complex but subtle. Starts sweet and yeasty, similar to the nose, but finishes dry with some chewy bitterness. The alcohol has a presence but I would not have guessed that the ABV is as high as it is.
M: Medium carbonation, smooth with small bubbles. Full bodied, long lasting finish.
D: There are no overpowering flavors, which lets this beer drink pretty easily. It should, however, be savored, both to experience the flavors and due to the ABV. 664 charactersseand, Nov 24, 2009

S: Sweet red fruit and raisins. Not even a hint of -OH. This is my personal version of heaven.
A: Enormous tan head. Amazing @ 11.3% abv. Phenomenal retention that leaves beautiful rings of lace and a creamy cover over an opaque dark brown body.
T: Well balanced despite slight booze. Fruit and raisins are again at the core. The booze can be a distraction without food.
M: Medium body with low carbonation. A bit hot turning to cool as it seems to evaporate off the tongue.
D: Not a session beer, but a wonderful choice for steak and mushrooms. Demands to be savored and shared.
O: Great beer that gets better as it approaches room temperature. I would have given it a better score if the -OH was more hidden. The 11.3% abv. makes this completely understandable. 820 charactersdpnelson1978, Nov 23, 2009

A- Loud fizzy carbonation doesn't really collect into a head at all. The bubbles are a deep tan, the beer is a murky, muddy red/brown almost purple. Lots of floaty yeasts (I think it got mixed up on the car ride home) no light is passing through this one, its about as clear as gravy.
S- Strong smell. I can smell it just sitting on the desk beside me. Its fruity like cherry and plum.
T- Sweetness of cherries and plums are in the taste too. Its well balanced though. There is some earthiness from the yeasts under everything. There is also a significant punch of alcohol. This is pretty complex and delicious.
M- Fairly thick, smooth with prickly carbonation. I feel like there is a bit too much carbonation. It finishes dry and hot.
D- This is a great sipper. Its really warming and full. 819 charactersMbpBugeye, Nov 21, 2009

S-sweet ripe fruit, plums are present with nice black cherry and light spicey pepper at the end
T-not what i expected, very good even though I have never been a belgian fan. the dark black cherry taste mixed with plum makes it very good to taste. there is definitely some belgian yeast in there (althought very light) it has some spice towards the end with some black pepper hints.
M-so smooth and thick, hint of carbonation with a little warming from the alcohol
D-very tasty, makes me want to sip and i do, slowly (normally i'm a fast drinker). thick full bodied beer with a nice warming effect and great flavor 766 characterscpetrone84, Nov 20, 2009

4.26/5  rDev -4.7%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Thanks to Abriggs1 for picking this up in Simsbury, CT!
11.2oz brown glass pry-top bottle. Label stamped 01103 07:54.
Appearance: Deep brown with some thin red notes in the core. Head is fluffy like a cappuccino head and tan to match.
Nose: Medium-roast coffee with fresh cream, sour cherry, varnished hard wood, and sticky turkish-like sweets aromas.
Palate: Sharp up front on the tip of the tongue rounding out to roasted malts, dark sour cherries, tree bark, and some subtle wooly qualities out on the finish. Finish is long and focused on that cherry note.
Notes: A seriously tasty quad. Didn't expect the cherry flavors, but they are appreciated (yes, I know there's none added). 689 charactersSFLpunk, Nov 17, 2009
4.37/5  rDev -2.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Poured from the bottle into my snifter, this beer has a nice big, creamy head. It is a murky brown and when held to the light the edges reveal some particles, but of what I'm not sure. There is a lasting ring around the glass and some nice lacing. The smell is great- rich and chocolately with some dark fruit; kind of like a deeper, richer doppelbock. This is one of the best-smelling beers I've ever had. The taste is also chocolate with a slight bit of alcohol in the background. Although it doesn't burn for the amount of alcohol in the beer, I can feel it warming my stomach. Nice. As it warms I get a hint of skunk flavor. I'm not sure how long this has been on the shelf but it could be a bit light-struck. Mouthfeel is smooth on the tongue but carbonation is a little harsh as it goes down my throat. Drinkability would be pretty good on this except for the price and amount of alcohol. I would look forward to having this again. 937 charactersltjska04, Nov 15, 2009

T: Sweet Malt, raisons, dates, Figs almost candylike. I cant taste any alcohol at all. This could be dangerous.
M: Medium mouthfeel. Not exactly light but not heavy either. This falls perfectly in the middle
D: WWWAAAAYYYY to easy to drink. This beer is delicious. There is no taste of alcohol. No heat from alcohol. If I didnt know better I could easily get myself into trouble with this beer, it goes down very easy. 645 charactersdondeez21, Nov 15, 2009

S- The nose is surprisingly simple with very strong aromas of bread and yeast. Further inspection reveals much more subtle aromas of molasses and metal.
T- Wonderfully bold bready and yeasty flavors combine with some booziness, plus lesser molasses and metallic notes... and just a *HINT* of candy sugar. Finishes sweet and hot (alcohol), in a WONDERFUL way!
M- Nice firm body is wonderfully textured with yeast sediment and unattenuated sugar. The carbonation is effervescent, yet gentle.
D- This crowning jewel of the Trappist beers is surprisingly drinkable, despite the high ABV. Just lovely! 803 charactersjgasparine, Nov 14, 2009

A: Dark brown murky brew with a fluffy white head. Alot of yeast floating in there. soon dissipates but leaves behind a blanket of bubbles. near the end of the drink the bubbles get a brown color to them.
S: Plums and cherry, chocolate cake
T: rich, belgian candy sugar, black cherry, plum and cocoa up front. finishes with dark fruits, spices and woody flavors.
M: a full bodied brew with a good amount of carbonation. entry is smooth and finishes dry. gives tongue a tingling sensation, likely from the high alcohol content
Overall, this is a complex and intriguing brew with rich aromas and flavors. Alot smoother than expected with the high ABV. 679 charactersOlRasputin989, Nov 14, 2009

S: Fruits. As it warmed up = malt, biscuits, alcohol.
T: Malts and caramel mix well with alcohol tongue zing. Reminiscent of some heavy Scottish Ales I've had. (home brews - sorry!)
M: alcohol leaves itself on the tongue but the delicious malts smooth the palate over creating a refreshing and crisp drinking experience.
D: I could probably drink a six pack of these on a cold winter night out on the deck with the dogs, or by the fire, and be the happiest person in the world. A very well made beer. 571 charactersbiophiliadude, Nov 13, 2009

Dark mahogany with ruby highlights--very Ron Burgundy. Large tan head and great retention for such an alcoholic beer.
Candi sugar, woody, herbal, cellar must mix with brownie batter and toffee. Alcoholic prickliness. 
Dark candi sugar slides into a robust, warming caramel and chocolate cake finish. Subtle boozy kiss. Less fruity and more dessert like than many quads of my fancy. 593 charactersdonkeyrunner, Nov 10, 2009

Smells of molasses, dark fruit, and vanilla. Alcohol is evident in there as well.
Taste is baking fruit bread, coffee cake. A little bit of dark fruit emerges as it warms, and the alcohol makes its presence known.
Mouthfeel is lighter than expected. Pleasant and not overpowering. 
Much less dark fruit and body than both the Cuvee Van De Kaiser and St. Bernardus 12. Interesting vanilla notes. 510 charactersdarklordlager, Nov 08, 2009

A. It was pretty dark. Almost like a Pepsi or something. A fluffy one inch head that shrunk into a small ring that stayed for the whole show.
S. Raisins. I smelled raisins. It smelled of malty sweetness. Like Christmas spices; cloves, ect.
T. Tasted like molasses or maybe brown sugar. And those darn raisins. Also tasted like alcohol. Also had hints of other dried fruits. Very tasty beer.
M. It was less carbonated than Westy 12 but still had a good amount. The alcohol is very warming, like brandy. The malt taste stays with you for a long time. Almost a syrup like aftertaste.
D. For how strong it is and how blatantly the alcohol presents itself, it is very drinkable. I finished one in about ten minutes and could easily have had a couple more. Excellent beer. Maybe the best quad that I have tried, which isn't very many. 874 characterscaliforniakulak, Nov 07, 2009

S - Raisins and brown sugar, nice alcoholic esters, some midl spices as well. Mild chocolate.
T & M - Nice alcoholic sweetness and warmness that develops as the bready and yeasty character coats every square inch of your mouth. Hints of raisins, chocolate as well. Whole wheat and sourdough bread tastes with nice brown sugar character. Some hop dryness at the end.

4.82/5  rDev +7.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5part of a 6, 8, 10 tasting
this beer pours a dark brown with very little off white head
the aromas are primarily of dark fruits including figs, dark cherris and plums as well as a warming alcohol note
the taste is devine starting out with rich fig flavors and molasses leading into a short stint in the toasty malt profile before you get the hot alcohol punch with a big chewy caramel ending. the alcohol is a little strong in younger beers like this but is not at all overpowering.
the finish for this dreamboat is that of a full heavy bodied belgian ale with a boozy sweetness that holds onto the tongue after the beer is gone. this is an absolutely amazing example of what great trappist beer can and should be and i will be drinking these periodicaly for years to come. 777 charactersBrandt, Nov 05, 2009

Pours a suprisingly dark brown, too cloudy to let light through, with bits of yeast floating about and a nut brown head that isn't very thick and dissipates to a film relatively quickly but never fully disappears. 
Smells of molasses, brown sugars, maybe buttered toast and a hint of nutty bitterness. 
Tastes both of dark fruits and fresh nuts, and also the aforementioned brown sugar and molasses. There is an alcohol sting as well, but faint. 
The feel is thick and full with carbonation present throughout that is both prickly and fine. 
Man, what a beer! I can see why this one is so highly regarded. Very tasty. The strength makes it hard to drink a lot but the pleasure makes it easy to want to try your luck. 736 charactersCylinsier, Nov 02, 2009
4.07/5  rDev -8.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.5Poured from a bottle into my Chimay chalice. Tasted back to back with Abt 12.
A: A dark brown with a reddish tint to it. A nice one finger frothy off white head stays due to the chalice etching. Nice lacing but it does recede back into the glass.
S: Sweet fruits with raisin, grape, cherry and plum. A big sweetness is detected along with a yeasty spice.
T: Fruits come up first with large flavors of grape, cherry, raisin, plum and maybe a hint of pear. The yeasty clove type spice is apparent with a big sugar sweetness that moves in after the fruit. The finish stays sweet with a pretty hefty alcohol flavor rounding out.
M: Full, coating, alcoholic and very sweet, maybe too much so.
D: Medium, the alcohol is way more prevalent than the ABT 12 and the sweetness lingers on. For that, the drinkability to me suffered a bit.
Overall a really good beer that may be a bit more complex than the ABT 12, however the larger alcohol presence and the sweeter finish makes it less enjoyable for me. I have another one that I will age to see if that helps the alcohol a bit, but still this is a great quad that is classic. 1,122 charactersKadonny, Nov 02, 2009

Appearance: A vigorous pour produces a nice deep murky brown color with little head to speak of and lots of bits of yeast floating around. 
Smell: Smells of sweet molasses, a bit of yeast, hints of dark fruit, raisins, dates, spices. A lot going on in the nose.
Taste: Taste of dark fruit, plum, caramel, with some alcohol mixed in. The alcohol pleasantly stings your mouth a bit. Lots of different tastes, but very well pulled together. 
Mouthfeel: Pretty thick and creamy. Finishes pretty long, but in this case, it's a very good thing. 
Drinkability: Well, the high ABV is definitely evident in this one, but even so, it goes down pretty quick. Still, I couldn't drink a lot of these. 
Overall, this is a very, very tasty and complex brew. Hella-well-balanced and the tastes and smells are masterfully blended together. Call me crazy, though, but I think I prefer the 8. Regardless, I wouldn't complain if I had to choose, this is a great beer. 1,039 characterszoso493, Oct 27, 2009

And don't get me wrong it is excellent and I would have again at any opportunity (or as long as I was not driving).
Apperance is a thick dark brown, and poured a two finger head which held up on a vigorous pour. 
Aroma was very complex, in the end the earthy and oaky smells were dominant accompanied by some limited fruit tones. There was also a distinct traditional Ale yeast smell to the beer.
Taste was very well balanced. The earthy/oaky aroma was noticeable in the taste, along with some sweet fruity flavors. You never lose track that this is an ale, with the yeast in balance and control of the flavor. There is very limited if any hops flavor, and balanced bitterness at the end. 
Mouthfeel was unexpectedly think and somewhat dry. Very pleasant.
Drinkability: This went down very smooth, especially for a quad. I did not notice the alcohol in the aroma nor taste. I did notice it in my head a little later. 1,045 charactersnjmoons, Oct 27, 2009

I have to be honest when i say that this one is (almost or even?)better than the Westvleteren 12. It's darker, gives more foam in the glass and for a longer time. The 'aftertaste'is superb. Like i have already said before; i like the blond beers better but this one is really really really super and it's very easy to get in Holland and Belgium. If you seek for the best beer? This is the one amongst others. 521 charactersBrabander, Oct 23, 2009

4.74/5  rDev +6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75From a 330ml. bottle into a large wine glass, this brew pours a deep amber in color, another step deeper than the #8. A half inch of mocha head likewise offers good retention and lacing and regenerates easily. Surface cap is deeper and reminiscent of an R.I.S. actually.
Nose is good, yet a bit unexciting for a Quad. More cocoa and milk chocolate than the #6 or #8 might present, yet the similarities are evident nonetheless. This brewery/Abbaye has one recipe of sorts, with three levels of delivery. This Quad knows its younger brothers well, yet what is good for a Dark Ale ain't buyin' it here in Quadville, or is it? A light and somewhat sour hoppiness transcends, on occasion. Overall, pretty flat on the nose with sugar crushing the yeast complexities I'm looking for.
This brew rebounds in flavor yet is a bit nondescript. Lots of cherry and chocolate are evident on the tongue, yet the complexities are thin. This beer looks good but doesn't excite. A bit too sweet in the end, I think there is a coverup of sorts going on. I'll stick to St. Bernardus 12 in the future. Nonetheless, sickly drinkable for its strength and a revisit with another batch shows much more complexity in the aroma and a nice feel. Updated fresh in Brussels. All bets are off as this may be the best Quad out there. 1,302 charactersHalfFull, Oct 21, 2009

I'm not just saying this after 1...I've had it a handfull of times. As soon as the cap comes off, you can smell this beer from across the room; and that's a good thing. Color is very dark...no daylight through this Quad. Very creamy thick head that holds on and leaves lasting lacing. Smells very sweet, and boozy. Taste consists of molassas and dark brown sugars, overripe fruit such as raisons and dates. Slight taste of the 11%+ alcohol content.
Taste improved as it warms up too. I usually start mine fridge temp...pour, wait about a minute or 2...and slowly enjoy it! Definately a need to try. 680 charactersShadesOfGray, Oct 17, 2009

Taste of dried fruits with a very complex malt character. Nice and complex Belgian, just what you would expect from a trappist.

Pours with loads of head, good retention and lace. Very dark brown liquid with some red to it. Smells of fig, raisin, pie crust, grapes, and lots of floral scents. Intensely aromatic. Superior in aroma.
Tastes of grapes, raisins, fruity esters, slightly earthy, and the midpalate showcases some alcohol presence. Finish brings earth and sugar. Quite good. Full bodied with a medium and smooth carbonation. Very well rounded.
As far as quadrupels go, this is undoubtedly top notch, taking first place in my little tasting. If they only sold this at the monastery it would be #1 on every beer website. The very solid A it has, however, is very fair indeed. 740 charactersvacax, Oct 15, 2009
4.23/5  rDev -5.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured a deep, dark brown/black. Held this up to the light, but it didn't do any good - mere light was no match for this brew. Frothy light brown that bloomed on top of this year and retained exceptionally well. Even after sitting for a while, there's still a nice layer of head on top. Great lacing.
The smell is so complicated. It's hard to pick out individual characteristics, but I seemed to pick up a buttery, plum, malty scent. Taste is equally complicated - again, plum, buttery, malt - slight hints of dark fruit in general, with maybe molasses. Mouthfeel is very good - silky, creamy, with fairly heavy carbonation. Leaves an after-feeling in the mouth that isn't dissimilar to syrup.
The alcohol is very noticeable with a distinct warming sensation - especially as the beer itself warms. The alcohol is blended well enough so as to not be offensive, but it's definitely there. Medium bodied.
All in all, very drinkable if you can handle the complexity and alcohol. 977 charactersMavajo, Oct 14, 2009

A: After an aggressive pour, there is two fingers of froathy head which slowly dicipated to a thin coating of a gorgeous off-white foam with what looks like nutmeg and cinnamon dashed over it as a topping. The body is a pitch dark brown that resembles a black coffee. After agitating this brew it left a beautiful lacing on the sides of my glass.
S: Banana nut bread, hints of molasses, cinnamon, and nutmeg. This smells so delicious without any alcohol present, which is very surprising for such a high ABV.
T: So complex! These flavors are blended so well together that it's hard to depict each one. On the front of the palate its spicy like ginger with a sweet buttery banana like flavor throughout. Notes of other spices are noticed like nutmeg and cinnamon. The back of the palate is a delicious molasses flavor. Once again the alcohol is hidden so well and is absolutely stunning!
M: Lightly carbonated and extremely smooth and creamy like a glass of milk. There is very little warming from the 11.3% ABV.
D: We are totally blown away by this brew! We need to get stocked up with Trappistes Rochefort 10. We think you should do the same.

3.85/5  rDev -13.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5Poured from bottle into Rochefort goblet. Poured a deep reddish-brown color with a thin tan head that had little retention or lacing.
The aroma was typical for the style, rich, full, earthy, slight fruit notes. The expected yeasty spice scents were very subdued, almost unnoticeable. The flavors followed along as expected. A smooth fruityness was the most noticeable, followed bt a slight alcohol taste. Again, the anticipated yeasty spice was not present.
The body was good, a little thin for the style. It flowed over the tongue smoothly and wasn't at all sticky. Drinkability was very good, typical for the style, but a little thinner and smoother than most.
Overall, a very good beer that everyone should try and try repeated times. A smooth easy drinking example of the style. 785 charactersbeertunes, Oct 11, 2009
4.52/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5A: Pours a very rich dark brown color that lets almost no light in. The head quickly dissipates, almost like a poured soda would, but eventually settles to a thin ring. Just a little lacing.
S: Some fresh fruit and citrus come to the nose. Also some roasted malts and caramels. 
T: Big caramel and malt flavor that warms as it goes down. Very slight bitterness that leaves the tongue tingling and wanting more. I almost feel like I'm drinking a fine brandy rather than a beer. This initially confused my pallet a little, but I got over it quickly. Really amazing taste overall!
M: Nice full body with light carbonation. Warms all the way down and a nice warm feeling stays in your chest for a long time.
D: So smooth and goes down really easy. I cannot believe how well the alcohol is covered. I love the warm feeling it leaves in my chest. This has the characteristics of a sipper, but I could definitely drink more than one (and pay for it in the morning!). 963 charactersMrDanno96, Oct 11, 2009

The colour is cloudy dark brown with an orange tinge and the smell is of comlex malts malts malts with caramel and cherries. The taste is nothing short of it and only the mouthfeel is slightly lacking in creaminess.

4.75/5  rDev +6.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Ok. So I picked up a bottle of the Rochefort 10, a Quadrupel Trappist beer, the strongest ale of the Rochefort line. I am hoping for a yeasty and sweet trappist with a bite. Rochefort has been doing it right for over 400 years The Rochefort brewery opened in 1595 and is the oldest Trappist brewery by 250 years. Think about that. Kings and nobles from the Renaissance drank Rochefort ales. Amazing...
Many Belgian beers are very champagne-y. Trappistes, however tend to have a fuller body than typical Belgains, which is my draw to Trappistes. The Rochefort 10 pours a deep amber color with a huge sticky head, which is consistent with Trappist viscosity and their traditional bottle conditioning.
Rochefort 10 smells of a deep cider. I love the sweetness of Trappistes and I can definitely smell the sweetness of the subtly roasted malts, but not much yeast, which is surprising given the prominence of Belgian yeasts.
Mmmm...the Rochefort 10 is very thick, but not so syrupy that it is too rich to handle. Monks have been doing this stuff for hundreds of years, so I am not surprised at all that this thing is spot on.
The bottle conditioning many times leaves a harsh carbonation that overpowers the flavor. Not so in this case. The malts are perfectly roasted and steeped to give a great thick consistency and the carbonation is just gentle enough to perfectly accent the body. I don't usually give Belgians a high mark on mouthfeel, but Trappiste brewers never fail to let me down.
Overall, this Rochefort 10, the crown of the Rochefort line, represents the essence of Trappist brewing. But then all 7 Trappist breweries really hit the nail on the head. Rochefort has been doing it right for over 400 years The Rochefort brewery opened in 1595 and is the oldest Trappist brewery by 250 years). Apparently practice makes perfect. 1,839 charactersstevenseg, Oct 08, 2009

a-great hazy chocolate colored body with a big 3 finger head. this beer just looks like it should taste great.
s-not a huge nose on this one. some nutty aromas mixed with a sharp fruit tone. maybe black cherry and figs. minor sour notes go along with the fruit.
t-this beer has so many individual flavors but deconstructing this beer is not what it deserves. this beer is at its best when you drink a big sip and let the multitude of flavors melt together perfectly. the ultimate harmony of flavors.
m-the 11% doesn't let itself be know until now. the minor burn along with the chewy nature of this beer are superb.
d-I am really enjoying this brew. I've had this a few times but this is the oldest bottle at one year. could definitely have more than one 808 charactersPALMEJ1, Oct 08, 2009

A- Poured into a Chimay goblet. Deep brown with maroon hues and a thin, almost non-exsistent tan head that actually retains nicely.
S-rich nose; caramel, raisin, amaretto, bread, and lactose.
T&M- Dried fruit, chocolate, brown sugar, and finishes dry with a firm alcohol presence. Full bodied with a lovely medium carbonation.

4.52/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 511.2 oz bottle bought from Buffalo, best before date of 2013, making this a 2008? Pours a dark russet brown hints of pumpkin/autumn orange on the highlights, lots of sediment in the glass. Thin khaki head that recedes to a thin leopard print pattern and then to swirls, easily agitated by the swirling of the glass, small patches of lacing stick to the glass.
Nose is lots of dark, ripe fruits - specifically grapes, figs, some raisin too but more grapish than some. Lots of fruity caramel malts, hints of spice.
This is a superbly balanced brew, probably the best quad I've had to date. Caramel, grapes, raisins, earth, biscuits, cloves, pepper, banana, hops, cocoa, and toffee. Pretty dry, which leaves it feeling more refreshing for a big brew. A touch sparkly on the carb but instead of a sharp carbonation it is more sprightly, aids the drinkability but is perhaps a touch much - if only a touch. 
Superbly drinkable for a brew this size. Very complex and engaging, makes for a nice combination in most any situation. Top notch. 1,036 charactersritzkiss, Oct 07, 2009

S - Molasses, brown sugar, oatmeal raisin cookies, yeast, alcohol, musty grapes, and chocolate malt balls (whoppers, Maltesers)
T - Dark fruit, candy sugar, anise, chocolate brandy, roasted caramel malt. Wonderful taste at the back end, dry, yeasty, dark bread with a hint of pepper and some alcohol to warm the soul. Very complex and wonderful from start to finish.
M&D - decent Carbonation that tickles the throat, smooth but lighter bodied than I expected. Even with it's strength I could easily drink more than one and feel great about it. 651 charactersthepeter, Oct 03, 2009

- This is much darker and solid than #8.... A&W RootBeer brown, not nearly as much sediment on the bottom... though visible in a bright 100 watt light.. Lovely frothy mocha head... didn't see this with the yeast used on the "8". This IS a different beast!
- Ester, grape, fig, and balancing hops... a fruity estery hoppy blend with a sweet fig malt... 
- So well balanced with ester, sweet light malts, fig, some spice, herb, and booze... how is this as strong as it is? What a blend! What a classic!
- Dry is one way, but slightly chewy, and aromatic.. the breathe is left waiting for a punch that isn't coming.
- This is a top-notch ale that is to be reckoned with! Very smooth, hardly strong, and very fine. Something to be had with a fine red meat, and lots of veggies. I am impressed, and have never had anything like it ever in the U.S. Worth the buy over and over! 1,025 charactersDocer, Sep 30, 2009

S. Smells of delicious dark candied fruit (plums, raisins, figs). Also sweet delcious malty alcohol smell with a peppery note at the end.
A. Damn this beer is crazy complex tasting. I definitely can't pick out all the little nuances. Dark sweet malt and a variety fruits that taste as though theyve been engorged with brandy (plums, black grapes, bananas, maybe even some sweet pineapple). Wonderful pepper tone also with a noticeable alcohol ester feel and warmth.

A: Poured a vigorous 2 finger creamy light caramel course head with great head retention. Brew itself was a dark brown with patchy lacing. 
S: Chocolate, ripe purple grapes, Belgian yeast, brown sugar, alcohol
T: Deep chocolate beginning with grape sourness and unripened green fruit starting to peak through in the middle along with brown sugar. Finishes strong alcohol with a strong warming sensation. No real strong taste stands out, but rather a blending of everything. 
M: Medium bodied but smothering and warming. Feels a little too carbonated but finishes clean. 
D: Enjoyable. Not my favorite style but the balance is very appreciated. 690 charactersSpeedwayJim, Sep 27, 2009

S--Dark fruit, yeasty funk, some woodiness. Interesting undertones.
T--Good, but I get a lot of wood on this, in addition to the usual yeasty and chocolaty tones.
M--Nice mouthfeel. Like the 8, a surprising amount of carbonation and a light weight.
D--High ABV, yes, but it's the slightly off taste that would keep me to one of these. Well made, tasty, but a little off. Could be this bottle. Would try again.

4.53/5  rDev +1.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured into a Duvel glass. Extremely deep burgundy beer with a 3-inch thick off-white/tan head. Bits of yeast sediment in the glass even though I poured it carefully. 
Aroma is of dark fruit and sweetness. Some belgian yeast funkiness, with a hint of spice and mixed with significant alcohol.
Taste is of strong fruitiness (dates, plums, etc.) and alcohol. The dark fruit is much more pronounced in the taste than in the aroma. Very enjoyable, with basically no detectable hop presence. 
Mouth feel is full-bodied and coats the tongue. It is balanced with a very mild prickliness that gives the beer a great feel and drinkability, especially for 11.3% abv. Overall, another quality trappist ale. I am a fan. 710 charactersFloppyDog, Sep 25, 2009

Tons of sweet spice and a combination of green and ripe fruits are abundant. There is so much going on here. Only a slightly hot alcohol bite keeps me from rating this one higher. I've never had St. Berny 12 or Westy 12, but I am a big Chimay Blue fan and I think this one trumps it. 368 charactersjoshuadlight, Sep 25, 2009

S: Rasins and honeydew melons which are beaten into submission by the spice of the booze. You do get a hint of licorice on the nose, but the rest of the hues are so negligible that I am not sure if I was imagining them.
T: Starts peppery. Most quads eventually offer that gentle warming sensation. Not this one. Nope, it goes balls deep with that right off the bat. Mellow esthers and hops, but still present. Smoky sugars and big malts that offer a fruity sweetness that follows the nose. The only detraction is a slight medicinal air to the beer.
M: Full bodied like a trappist milkshake. Smooth as silk, though.
D: When I want a quad, I will reach for this. Or at least I would if it were available in Texas...dammit. 898 charactersDeathbySexyBT, Sep 24, 2009

Dark brown in color with lots of sediment and flakes floating around. Smell was bold fruitiness with a noticeable alcohol presence. Taste was dark fruits, plums, malts, and a little bit of butterscotch taste as it warmed up. A little hard to drink at first due to all the carbonation, wasn't very pleasant at first until it settled down. Noticeable alcohol heat when drinking.

A-Murky dark brown beer, allowing little light through. Big, fine-bubbled frothy dark-tan head on top, which sustained quite nicely.
S-Fruity, a hint of cola/Dr. Pepper, malty sweetness, which seemed to mix well with an almost souring fruitiness.
T-Big maltiness is the focus of this brew, but the malt sweetness also worked nicely with some easy, spicy nuances. Don't get me wrong, though; bitterness has its time to shine in this brew. Smooth alcohol flavor appeared in the finish initially, but became more apparent and more harsh/out of balance as I continued drinking this brew. Otherwise, the finish is pretty calm, bitter and semi-sweet.
M-Very fine-bubbled, smooth but excitingly prickly carbonation, which I found to be enjoyable. This seemed to distract me from the high ABV for a time, which made itself known largely by it's huge warming on my palate.
D-Pretty decent brew. I could see the beer's drinkability decreasing as the alcohol became more apparent, likely the result of the beer warming, to the point it became harsh, no longer smooth. I think this detracted from this brew overall. 1,143 charactersCHSLBrew, Sep 16, 2009
4.2/5  rDev -6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4A- dark, cloudy brown. Poured very cloudy, even though it's been sitting still for a month.
S- this is really sad, apparently my seasonal allergies are kicking in, because I='m missing most of the nose. I get some spice and some very clear roast notes, with yeast and fruit, but it isn't as clear as it should be, or as pungent as I'm sure it really is. 4 because next time I have this, it will smell like a 4.
T- alcohol is almost the first thing to hit the palate, but that flavor quickly changes to estery complexity, and is joined by clove and nutmeg flavors. The swallos is slightly yeasty, and the thick, malty aftertaste carries us into longing for the next sip.
M- creamy, not too thick. Good. Carbonation is pleasent, but not especially high.
D- 11.3%? I won't have 2, c'mon. But it is delicious, and I will be looking forward to buying more. 855 charactersWalrusJockey, Sep 15, 2009

The smell is complex--caramel is prevalent along with yeast, dark fruits (particularly figs), and spices. The taste is strong of caramel, malty, but the spiciness gives it a nice balance. There's some alcohol warming, but it's subdued. Mouthfeel is thick overall with some biting carbonation. 
This is a drinkable beer that should be drunk slowly given the high ABV that is covered up so well. Nice balance in the flavor. 537 characterstheghost3, Sep 14, 2009

A: Simply impeccable: 11.2 oz fills the oversized tulip glass up to (and just over) the brim; the body is nearly pitch black (just the faintest hints of ruby at the bottom, and then only when held up to direct light), and is topped with a beautiful, huge, frothy, rocky, tan head with chunks of brown yeast suspended in it here and there. Lace coats the glass as the head settles into a solid cap. Beautiful.
S: Big, bold, and complex. Huge, sweet, fruity malts take center stage (raisin, plum, and maybe even apricot), followed by a wave of spicy yeast aromas: cinnamon is #1, followed by clove and perhaps cardamon. A bit of alcoholic heat at the tale end. Superb.
T: Amazingly balanced; the fruity malts and spicy yeasts coexist in perfect harmony, backed up with the dry warmth of the alcohol on the finish. I'm not getting quite as much complexity as I did in the aroma, but this is simply a delicious brew. 
M: Medium bodied (a bit thinner than I was expecting - certainly no thicker than the 8), with light, smooth carbonation. Good, but not the best feeling beer of the style.
D: Not bad at all for being over 11%, but this is still definitely a sipper. EDIT: I originally gave this a 3.5 for Drinkability, but am now changing that to a 4.5 for Overall; this beer is terrific.
Notes: I really need to have this head to head with St. Bernardus ABT 12; both beers impressed me, and I gave them pretty similar scores (although this one does better on appearance and aroma, while the St.B did better for mouthfeel and drinkability). This strikes me as a distinctly dryer example of the quad style, and I love both types; I'm just not sure which is my favorite. All in all, this has been a great evening having all three of the Rochefort lineup; the 10 definitely took the gold metal, followed by the 6 and then the 8 (in a near tie). Great beers all.
Cheers! 2,065 characterswoosterbill, Sep 14, 2009
4.47/5  rDev 0%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 330mL bottle into my Trappistes Rochefort chalice. Finally getting around to reviewing this (after drinking at least a dozen of them over the years). 
Bistre liquid with russet and chocolate highlights. Small wheat colored foam subsides to a large collar with half a head. Globules of chocolate yeast form little islands on top of the foam. Minimal lacing, thin sticky legs.
Rich, lightly roasted malt, sweet sourdough starter, golden raisins, figs, brown bread, clove, allspice, apricot stones, and more in the nose. Estery alcohol as well. When allowed to warm up a bit, it becomes superlative.
Malty yet tart on the palate, with a rich bready funk. Sour-cherry, prunes, leather, bittersweet cocoa, and brandy appear as well. The finish is both sweet and dry, and the potent flavors imparted by the alcohol persist for some time.
Somewhat viscous (though not sticky) medium body, with moderate carbonation. 
With the intensity of flavor, and the high ABV, this is a sipper and makes for a rustic yet equally fine replacement for several varieties of wine. 
While great on its own, this ale really comes alive when served with a good cheese (anything from aged Mimolette, to an oozing Taleggio) or roast poultry (e.g. game hen). A revelation the first time I tried it, this ale catalyzed my search for ever-more intense flavors and craftsmanship in the beer universe. While I no longer find it to be mind-blowing, there is nothing disappointing about this ale - it remains one of the most mature (if not sacred) examples of the style and of the potential of beer in general. 1,595 charactersaugustgarage, Sep 13, 2009

Palate- Molasses, fig, cherry, raisin, spicy. Just like the nose, the flavors blend together very well. Alcoholic warmth keeping with the syle.
Mouthfeel- Full bodied, but the carbonation level keeps it from being too heavy.

The beer smells of figs, plums, molasses, earth, and perfumy coriander. Alcohol notes also become apparent as it begins to warm.
Taste follows suit with dark fruits, burnt sugars and a light coriander and hop spiciness. A pleasant warming alcohol hangs around on the back of the tongue and trails down the throat after each sip. A warning to the actual strength of this beer.
While the mouthfeel is full, this beer certainly isn't overly-thick, syrupy, or sweet. It finishes semi-dry as do all of the great Trappist quads and strong dark ales. This, and the creaminess from bottle conditioning are the real keys to their wondrous drinkability.
Overall, a world-class beer and one that I would put head-to-head with any wine in the world as a complex, sophisticated drink, to pair with a fine cheese or meal. 1,005 charactersbump8628, Sep 10, 2009

Served in a Chimay glass at 11.1C (52F).
A: First off i noticed the giant yeast cake on the bottom of the bottle. I poured carefully, hoping it wouldn't come loose and get into the glass, but it came loose immediately and voilá: I had a glass of expensive beer with yeast globs swirling around in it. I waited for it to settle, as much as possible that is, and reviewed the appearance before I tasted it. 
It's a thick, dark-red-brown to tar colored liquid with a slightly beige head. The head is quite thick and creamy and makes it look pretty good. Nice head retention and nice CO2 level.
S: Dark malts and dark sugars. Quite spicy: I got some cardamom and cinnamon for sure. Molasses. Quite fruity, but more like old fruit, like the smell of an apple that's turned brown of age. Some estery yeast smell, but not too much. I also got a slight vegetal, funky smell that reminded me of the smell of trub that's been in the brew kettle for a while after the wort's been transferred. Being a homebrewer I know that smell...and I don't like that smell in beer.
Good potential but it's not worth more than a 2. Once again, this beer is very highly rated so most people would probably not agree with me, but it's what I think and that's the score I'd give any other beer if it had these properties.
T: Very intensive. Dark, high cocoa-percentage chocolate, some hop bitterness, plums and spicy, almost chili-like flavors and aromas that make this beer quite hot. And the alcohol is not very bitter, but it tastes like vodka. You know that spicy, hot taste of pure vodka - well, it's there! A bit resiny too and some burnt sugar.
M: Creamy and full, nice CO2 but my overall feeling about this brew makes me want to give it no more than a 3.
D: The vodka-like alcohol tones, the trub-like aroma and the unpleasant bitterness that struck me in the back of the mouth and quite hard on the palate makes it very hard to drink.
Summary:
It's not like other trappists, even the other Rocheforts which I like, that just takes a long time to drink because they are so full-bodied and instensive with their rich flavors. 
This beer takes a long time to drink because it just isn't good. It's no good and I don't recommend it....and I NEVER thought I'd say that about a trappist beer! But there you go. And I deeply and sincerely mean it. Go buy the 8 instead if you like trappists, it's MUCH better! 2,490 characterskrunchie, Sep 06, 2009
4.41/5  rDev -1.3%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Very dark copper pour, large head fades quickly.
Very perfumy aroma: citrus fruits, apples, doughy yeast, candi sugar, plums, rose-like alcohol, peach blossom, woody honey.
Flavours are quite sweet: candi sugar, caramel, golden syrup, figs. Silky alcohol merges with a light bitterness to create an impressive finish that builds up in the first few seconds after swallowing.
High carbonation (too high in my opinion). Some alcoholic tingling on the sides of the tongue, but not harsh in any way.
Superb. 503 charactersCrazyDavros, Sep 06, 2009
3.37/5  rDev -24.6%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3 |  overall: 2.5A: Blackish brown beer with a light tan head. Head is about 2 fingers but fading fast. It has bubbles that are mostly medium size and up, none of the little tiny ones and no active carbonation. Looks good, not great but above average. I just noticed what I hope is clumps of yeast on top of my foam. Major turn off.
S: Sweet cooking fruit, like berries or something, with a hint of alcohol. No hops. Really get the Belgian Candi sugar smell.
T: Hides the alcohol well, that's for sure. But it tastes thin to me, not full bodied like most other quads and I like when they are full. And there something else about this guy, maybe too sour? Or just too spicey. As I drink more I get various bursts of flavor. But still, not strong enough for me. I can also start to taste the booze. I give it a four because it has a lot in there, could have been a five with more power though.
M: Thinnish, flattish, I just can't do it.
D: This one is just not for me, and I have a hard time imagining other people drinking it. I think I need to go on a Belgian vacation for a while. 1,068 charactersmdwalsh, Sep 04, 2009
4.14/5  rDev -7.4%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 411.2 oz bottle.
Appearance: Truthfully, it looks a little like really dirty water. When you hold it to the light, its a little more like unfiltered apple cider. Hazy, brown. There's a big thick head that doesn't last long, and scant lacing. Its not off putting, but not really pretty either.
Smell: Here we go. Dark fruit. Lots of booze. Spicy. Sweet malt. Yeast bread. 
Taste: It definitely has alcohol. After an initial burn, all those raisins, dates, plums, etc that have been soaking in that booze come out. They're slightly sweet, spicy, and delicious. This is served on a slice of delicious yeasty bread. Again, booze is heavy on the back.
Mouthfeel: Hard to grade this down. Very full. This beer is chewy. The carbonation is nice and keeps things tingly.
Drinkability: I really love this stuff. However, the alcohol is quite present in a way that is (almost) off putting. There are other readily available Belgian quads (St B) that hide the alcohol for less than or equal to the price of this. In this style category, I demand perfection, and while I think this is excellent, its not perfect. 1,104 charactersrapidsequence, Sep 03, 2009
4.28/5  rDev -4.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Been waiting for a day of significance to drink the last remaining in my stock, but I guess the end of the summer vacation shall suffice. Pours very dark, the darkest of browns that can still fall into the category. The head is light tan with swirls of brown in it. Some sediment finds its way to the top after a while and forms a gang. Lacing is modest but available. Smell is complex, maybe too complex for my preception at this point, but I'm getting a lot of dried fruit, rum-like quality, pepper, and the booze is lined up in there. The taste is excellent and develops as the temperature climbs. Plums, raisins, and figs with an alcoholic kick in the ass soon after swallowing. The mouth is very creamy yet still retains more of a medium body. The carbonation was a bit much right after pouring, but subsided and is now actually a bit lacking as I have whittled it down to a few sips left. This is nearly irrelevant as the creaminess and sustain of the feel are wonderful. It be exciting to see how this beer turns out if you wait the recommended five years or so they suggest. All in all this is a complex, hearty beer that drinks quite well considering the high ABV. I'll be returning to this one in the future with more perspective and knowledge on the style. 1,267 charactersatremains, Sep 02, 2009
4.85/5  rDev +8.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Assuming a five year shelf life, this is a 2008. Tons of sediment in the bottle. Didn't pour the last inch of the bottle into the glass before reviewing...drank from a slender red wine glass.
Nose is smooth sweet, a bit of pepper, a little more vanilla, oak
Flavor is infinitely complex but in greater harmomy than any other beer I have ever had. Vanilla, some not so sweet honey, hardly any alcohol, mild presence of yeast, something like the sourness of a fine grappa comes into the aftertaste and the alcohol becomes noticeable. Outstanding.
Glad I finally got around to trying this. 589 charactersallboutbierge, Aug 31, 2009
4.28/5  rDev -4.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4A: Poured with a large, off-white head... that surprisingly diminished to about 1/4 finger size over a minute or two. Body is cloudy and murky, with a dark brown color. Some lacing, but not as much as I'd expect.
S: Aroma is of some light, bready yeast, clove, and light alcohol as well. Some other things in there I can't put my finger on, but very pleasant overall.
T: Wow... lightly sweet at the beginning, with spices present (cloves?). Continues to change as it finishes slightly warm due to the high alcohol content. Taste stays for a long time and continues to kick.
M: Full-bodied and creamy, with average carbonation. Excellent.
D: A fantastic sipping beer... the alcohol content luckily keeps it from being TOO drinkable, but it's an excellent beer to sit back with and let the flavors come out even more as it warms. 831 charactersberley31, Aug 31, 2009
4.5/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A: Poured into a Chimay glass with a nice thick one finger head that maintained a thin, yet rich ring of lacing around the glass. Very dark opaque ruby brown appearance with a lot of nice, suspended floating particles.
S: Sweet malts and a distinct note of sweet fruits such as bananas, figs, and/or raisins initially dominated the nose. Then the aroma of cloves, spices, candied sugars, and alcohol came through.
T: Very complex and smooth! Initially tasted the bananas and figs with a hint of cloves and vanilla. The alcohol then began to appear along with sugary malts. At some point I detected a hint of peppery spice. Also noted some smokiness and mild bitterness in the finish.
M: Medium bodied and creamy with mild carbonation and a nice, light alcohol heat.
D: Excellent. So smooth that I could drink several. The alcohol is well hidden. 845 charactersspratmi, Aug 29, 2009
4.67/5  rDev +4.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5An extraordinary brew. Top of the line reference for a Belgium quad. Outstanding.
Presentation: 11.2 oz US imported bottle. Simple, old font, design. No description other than the trappist certificate. Does not show date of freshness but has an insider batch print (180314 09:21). Neither shows IBUs or °Plato, only Alc. by Vol. (11.3%) Poured into a snifter.
A - Dark opaque red brown with small floating particles. Great brown foamy head that leaves a nice lace as it comes to a fine top layer with bursting lumps. 
S - Heavy/sweet smell with a medicinal/herbal tiny tone to it.
T - Sweet maltiness complexity around an alcohol warming base. 
M - Dark fruity stickiness on a medium to full body brew, with a nice complex smoothness fur such an alcoholic beer. 
D - Great drinking pleasure. Best enjoyed sipping and regretting the moment it is over unless you have another one around helping you to wonder when will you have it next time. 
Notes: Tremendous beer. This is one of those show-offs that can withstand all the reputation of a style. One may need to be into beers of this complexity, sweetness, and alcoholic content, meaning that it may be tough to offer it out of the blue to untested palates. But I'd be glad to try it, share it, and keep on enjoying it. 1,277 charactersDaniellobo, Aug 27, 2009
4.75/5  rDev +6.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5This is my first review ever on BA, so I'll do my best.
The bottle I got was a brown bottle, tan label. The date was 12/31/2013 so I'm not too sure about how old it was.
A: Very dark, opaque. Truly a nice color for a beer, it looks similar to a Stout with a little more amber brown to it. The head dissipated a little quicker than I thought it should, but that's ok - it's stayed solid throughout the session. Wonderful lacing along the glass, it just sticks to it like a spider web.
S: A nice bouquet that smells of raisins. Not overwhelming at all, in fact, as the beer warms, it's very inviting.
T: I'm a beer novice, I'll admit, but damn! this beer is sooo complex. I'm really unable to pick out the subtleties like others have already. As it warms, it gets better, the flavors stand out and it starts to really warm your soul. It has as subtle woodsy flavor to it, more clove like. There is definitely some spice to it and some sweetness that stays in your mouth long afterward.
M: Very creamy and full bodied. It fills my mouth with flavor and sticks to my cheeks like syrup almost. That might be a poor choice of words, let's just say it's wonderful. Carbonation is good, though it's hard to tell with the spiciness sort of taking over for the fizz.
D: Definitely a sipper. You can't swill this stuff, it must be enjoyed over a period of time. The flavors change as it warms and sits for a while.
Overall, a very enjoyable beer for this novice. I highly recommend it. It's a very complex beer that'll have you wondering how they can pack so many different flavors into one beer, yet balance it so well. Heaven in a bottle! 1,636 charactersDamienJax, Aug 26, 2009
4.32/5  rDev -3.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Pours into a chalice a mud brown color with active tan head. Constant action in the center. Small particles swirling about. Clinging lace present.
A familiar smell I've come to love from quads. Over ripe fruit, espicially bananas. Cloves, caramelized sugar, caramel and toffee. Complex.
Complex as hell. Black licorice, burnt sugars, dark fruit like raisin and fig. Pretty good alcohol presence. Also getting some hops. Maybe a hint of tobacco.
Tiny carbonation bubbles tickle the tongue. Almost full bodied. Warming sensation from the alcohol. Slight hop bite.
Absolute sipper. Pretty big ABV and it's tasted. Does it live up to the hype? I would say probably yes. I need to have it again to say that. Right now I can think of another quad I would have over this. Outstanding beer none the less. 800 charactersjera1350, Aug 26, 2009
2.46/5  rDev -45%look: 4 | smell: 3 | taste: 2 | feel: 3 |  overall: 2Well I sure hope that I dont get stoned for this one...I did not like this beer at all. I honestly think it was the very high alcohol in this but not really sure. I will admit this is the first quad I have ever bought so maybe its just not my style but couldnt even finish this. Even after paying $6 for this bottle!!
Poured into glass and noticed bits floating around (this is normal though for this beer) the dark brown beer with a really nice head. I really thought it looked great in the glass and was really excited to try. Go in for it and noticed a pretty decent smell. My smile quickly turns into a frown. My first taste wasnt bad (although not good) and could really notice the alcohol/wine taste which was nice but as this beer started to warm a little I just couldn't continue. Drank about 1/2 and just had to quit. Not enjoyable at all. 
Im sure if you are someone who enjoy quad beers than this would be good but just not for me. 944 charactersdfranks, Aug 23, 2009

4.94/5  rDev +10.5%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured a very dark brown with a one finger white head from an 11.2oz bottle into an oversized chalice like wine glass. Head has a small retention all the way down the glass that leaves amormphous looking blobs of head on the sidewalls of the glass.
Smells of toffee and dark fruit with a notable alcohol presence. I smell a bit of aromatics like cinnamon and nutmeg and maybe a bit of clove. Im getting undertones also of what can only be described as dark vanilla. 
Taste is extremely complex with lots of dark fruits and an almost smokey taste but in a wonderful way. Certainly the most complex brew I've ever had the pleasure of enjoying. 
Mouthfeel is smooth with a dry finish and a definite alcohol warmth. 
This is a definite sipper and its wonderful to sit and enjoy for a long time trying to figure out all the little complexities that exist in this wonderful beer. 
Im glad I got two, of them even if they were 6$ each. I will definitely be getting this again whenever I can find it. It was worth the wait and the 45 minute drive to get one. 1,055 charactersSTEG, Aug 22, 2009
4.15/5  rDev -7.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Bottle pours a very dark brown with very little light passing through. Has a thin tan head. Aroma is a complex array of dark fruits. Mostly prune and plum. Mouthfeel is thin bodied with a fair amount of carbonation. Flavor is very complex. Has dark fruit flavors, alchohol, dark chocolate caramel, spiciness, cola like features, and is very fruity on the finish. Overall this is a great beer. The only way to balance it more would be to have less alcohol strength or a little more balance between the dark fruit flavors and dark malt sweetness. Still a solid beer. 564 charactersfiver29, Aug 21, 2009
4.37/5  rDev -2.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4This beer pours a cloudy deep amber-brown. A two finger of nice frothy heads sits on top with excellent head retention. Thick sheets, sometimes streaky, of lacing coat the side of the glass the entire way down. A bit of sediment is noticeable in the head. Nose is of dark fruits - some raising and plums, spices, sugar and a touch boozy. Taste is of dark fruits up front, like they were soaked in alcohol. Raisins, plums, and cherries dominate. Caramel and toffee malts with a touch of sugar. Finish is a bit nutty with some spice to it. Alcohol is present, warms you, but doesn't overpower. Medium bodied, medium carbonation, nice thick and smooth, alcohol warms but the beer is so tasty you have to watch out. This is a great beer! 733 charactersJayli, Aug 21, 2009
4.3/5  rDev -3.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured into a snifter.
Pours a translucent dark-red to purplish color that a forms a thin bubbling white head with little to no lacing. Not much retention also upon vigorous swirling in snifter. Lots of floating particles when shined in front of a light. After about 30 minutes of settling down and warming, the aromas are full of malt, bread, fig, burnt sugar and heat from the booze. There's a sort of wine-like characteristic to this quad, which is very nice. 
The initial taste is full of sweet and bready malt with a sort of peppery/cinnamon spice going on. Towards the end, there's a nice palpable bitterness that coats the tongue, along with an alcoholic aftertaste and burn. There's a very smooth earthiness also to this beer. Complexity at its best. The mouthfeel has a decent amount of carbonation to its medium body. At 11.3% ABV, the alcohol is not very overpowering. It's palpable, but not overly dramatic for its high level. Very smooth drinking, be it that you sip this as you nurse it in your hand.
For my first quad, this is quite nice and enjoyable. A definite benchmark for other quadrupels. 1,113 charactersinfi, Aug 20, 2009

S - Sweet aromas, brown sugar, with dark fruits, clear grapes. Ever so slightly grainy. 
T - Heavy sweet malts in the initial flavours, followed by a spiciness, with a hint of pepper. The aftertaste is driven by the alcohol, providing a beautifully warming bittersweet taste. There is hints of chocolate in the finish with red-wine-like grape flavours. Incredibly complex and layered. 
M - Heavy and rough in the palete. Warming kick in the finish. 
D - There is little wonder why this beer is held in such high esteem. It is one of those beers that has to be experienced. Openly powerful in the alcohol but brilliantly balanced with strong rich flavours. I have three more of these that I am cellaring, and i'm finding it very hard not to drink them! 841 charactersPartyBear, Aug 18, 2009

Pours a great, dark creamy color with little lacing. Not very high on carbonation, which makes sense with the high abv, 11.3%. Lots of yeast floating around which is a beautiful thing. The taste is so nice yet, for a beer this strong, surprisingly mellow. Lots of dark sugars and sweetness, yet all of which is mellow. The smell was nice as well, but it did not have quite as much of a smell as you would think. Overall, a great brew, A+. 555 charactersbige2118, Aug 17, 2009

Dark chocolate, liqorice, molasses and some fig aromas. Hop aromas are kind of muted. A touch more restrained than I expected but still insanely good. Comes together in perfect balance on the palate. Alcohol is warming, some medicinal flavours there too. Chocolate and fig vibes in harmony with the serious bitterness. Low carbonation helps the divine creaminess of this beer. Truly awesome. One to savour. 486 charactersjuju7, Aug 17, 2009

Beautiful nose, some chocolate , raisins, a little bit of plum,a hint of boozey heat and something like brown sugar soaked bread.
The tastes is out of this world. Its creams, and smooth, with hints of rum raisin cake like flavors. Some plum again, and some readiness. Its a touch sweet, touch, which is the only thing keeping me from making the flavor score a 5.0.

4.65/5  rDev +4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5A = Poured very dark brown with some deep red tones as well. Big soapy head quickly dissipated. Moderate lacing. 
S = Intense aromas of dark fruits, spices, and malt. Bread and yeast also present. You don't have to hunt to find the smell here, it hits you head on. 
T = Very intense flavors. Has a very strong sweet front, something like brown sugar, molasses, and cinnamon. There's a rum like presence to go with the classic dark fruit notes of the belgian quads - raisins, plums, and figs. The yeast is subdued, which I prefer. There is a bit of a hop bite in the finish, with only moderate alcohol burn. Exceptionally well done. 
M = A bit jumpy on the carbonation in the beginning, although it settles down. Smooth and creamy for the most part. 
D = Given the style, this is quite drinkable. The ABV is disguised. The taste is not. 
Overall, possibly better than the TW12, which is saying a lot. 904 charactersJonMich13, Aug 16, 2009
4.41/5  rDev -1.3%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Second brew from my latest offering that I got from Abe's Cold Beer in Bethlehem. Decided to go with a few classics this time and it's tough to find one any more legendary than Rochefort 10.
A: Dark brown, almost black, with a creamy off-white head which left some decent lacing.
S: Nice caramel, dark fruits, touch of cinnamon, and a good undertone of earthy/ yeastiness.
T: A nice mixture of dark/ fall fruit flavors, caramel, toffee, booze, and nuts. All balanced quite nicely with a VERY Belgian yeasty/ earthy undertone. 
M: Creamy and full-bodied with moderate carbonation 
D: I can see why this is a classic, a nice sipping beer with extremely unique flavors. I liked the old world style and flavor, this is a brew that will stand the test of time. I'm excited to try a few more Quad's (now that my palate has developed more of a liking) with St. Bernardus Abt 12 ready in the fridge. It goes without saying that a beer this storied is a must try amongst the beer loving public.
I tried to drink this a bit too cold when I started and I realized pretty quickly I had to let it warm a bit to bring out the full flavor (be warned). 1,142 charactersjdg204, Aug 15, 2009

4.13/5  rDev -7.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5I'm definitely still developing my palette for trappist ales, and drinking beers such as the rochefort 10 is really helping me along my way. this was an awesome, very noteworthy brew that a few of us enjoyed sharing until the last drop.
the sight of it is really something to behold. dark cola in complexion, the head definitely revealed it to be far beyond a mexicoke (coke in a bottle... we can only find them out here in taquerias...). it was eggshell in color, and rocky as it subsided... looked like the underside of a cloud sitting on top of the beer.
smelled sweet and soapy with some banana esters. it wasn't far off from what I'm used to smelling in a belgian, though clearly more alcoholic than normal.
tasted of brown sugar, caramel, raisins and... alcohol... really a very hot beer, but there's a ton more going on aside from the alcohol itself, I want to make that much clear. this beer rounds out with a sugary sweetness that just sits at the back of your mouth for years.
mouthfeel was nothing short of full and creamy... that's really all I have to say about it.
I would say this were much more drinkable if it weren't for the sharp alcohol bite. I enjoyed every aspect of it, just couldn't handle a ton. 1,225 charactersEliottJW, Aug 13, 2009

4.08/5  rDev -8.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Poured deep brown with a 1 inch tan head. Carbonation is very noticeable right away. Smells of dark fruit, caramel, and spices. Tastes of heavy malt, dark fruit and spice, with a well perceived alcohol. Hops come through on the backend to balance out the brew. Mouthfeel is good and chewy. I thought drinkability was good, but not great. I prefer the St. Bernardus ABT 12 in that regard. The alcohol flavor is more pronounced in the Rochefort, which detracts from its otherwise wonderful flavors. It is definitely a sipping brew, and I would definitely have another given a chance. Goes great with a nice heavy meal. 656 charactersillinijer, Aug 13, 2009
4.25/5  rDev -4.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Poured into a goblet for a small tan head resting on top of a dark brown body. Caramelized malt and sugar on top of yeast and orange/dark fruits all hit my nose. Great smooth and creaminess tucked into a medium body. There is a sweetness to this beer from caramel and sugary candy flavors as well as a smoothness derived from something like oak/wood which is noticeable on back end. Balanced w/ fruit flavors like orange and some figs, there is a light herbal and spicy hop presence in the back which leads to a balanced beer with a little bit of a dry kick. The ABV complements the backend as well but by no means overpowers the beer whatsoever. This is a great beer to sip on, especially after a meal. 703 charactersclayrock81, Aug 12, 2009

Apricot, raisins, dark fruits, all followed by a sweet nuttiness and enveloped in a nice subtle spice.
Sweet citrus hits first but only for a second quickly the apricot and honey flavors next sip brings more dark fruits and brown sugar. Nice peppery bite from the alcohol, its not very hidden, but its very appropriate.
The heavy carbonation pairs well with the thick malty body and equally high alcohol. I have one aging in the cellar can't wait to see what a couple of years do to this bad boy. 590 charactersbfields4, Aug 11, 2009

A: a great big head erupts out of my tulip. It's beige, frothy, and gorgeous over my ruby red and mahogany ale. Incredible retention and wonderful lacing. There's not a thing about the appearance that could be improved. 
S: massive aromas out of the pour. Fruits like figs and berries, dark spices, and candied sugar. Heavy on malts with some hot alcohol in the back. Also peppery and is that a hint of banana?
T: wow. More complexity here than I have the palate for! Huge sweet malts are so present with dark fruits and berries gracing my palate with their presence. Spiciness tickles my tongue. I get very subtle hints of coffee but they come and go so quickly. Anise is light but surely present, as is a thin caramel-like flavor. There's probably a better way to describe it, but all I can think of "flavor of candy you want to suck on all day." Stone fruits get stronger with warmth. The alcohol is there, but it in passing for now. One more note here is the oak/wood. This is a flavor that is an anchor for all other flavors that combine to make this sublime beer. Apples pull through with even more warmth. I am floored. This is truly brilliant. 
M: medium body and carbonation. Sweet residuals coat my palate and even dry it a bit. 
D: though it's a sipper, I'd drink it before the alcohol rears its head. I'd love to try this with 2 years on it! 1,469 characterswashburnkid, Aug 10, 2009
4.85/5  rDev +8.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Picked this up at Joe Canal's in Lawrenceville, NJ for about $6.XX
A: Pours a deep, rich cloudy, unfiltered mahogany color that produces a MASSIVE rocky, fluffy, billowy off-white color. Truly a thing of beauty. Retention is perfect - the foam remains the entire time. Tons of yeast chunks at the end of the glass. Simply amazing. 
S: Yeasty at first, but as it warms up, tons of different fruits come out. Very complex, and as it warms, it only gets deeper and deeper. Alcohol IS a little upfront when it warms, but not distracting. Bubblegum. Raisins, plums, apricot, and a few other dark fruits that I still cannot identify. Pears and slight banana as well. (I'm reviewing as we speak so I've been finding things as I go here). 
T: Fruity and complex. Warming alcohol is present, yet at the same time pretty well hidden. More plum, raisin, and apricot...very mellow yet powerful fruits provide a low key flavor profile, but the sheer complexity of this brew is absolutely mind blowing. Also, I'm getting some woody notes, as well as some nutty flavors. The yeast also adds a unique Belgian aspect; esters, bubblegum, and spearmint
MF/D: Nice and chewy for a quad. Rich flavors provide a long, pruney/plumy finish. Truly chewy. Very clean and crisp.
Notes: I much prefer this brew to the Westvleteren 12, and perhaps the best beer I have sampled to date. People say that the US makes the best beer, but try to touch the Belgian's ability to create this velvet mouthfeel and play with the yeasts like this. That alone is proof that the Belgian's still have some things on lock. 1,583 charactersscottyshades, Aug 10, 2009
4.7/5  rDev +5.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Thick black and opaque. A caramel rich head with bubbles appearing from the depths of its abyss. No sediment in the bottle at all.
A smell rich with flavor and complex malts. Fruit sents of grapes and pears.
Taste is strong and very malty. It would do well to age this beer for a few years. There are many wonderful flavors swirling across my pallet with purple colors flooding my mind.
With a sudden presence of wine a sharp fizz pulls its deadening rush of nerves across my mouth. After a few sips I am now used to the rush and rather enjoyed those first sips of the beer taking over my mouth's sense of feeling.
Superbly drinkable, but with cellar age under its belt this beer could do wonders.
Cheers,

Pours a deep mahogany color with red highlights. A thin off white head caps the beer
Loads of dark fruit - raisins,plum, a bit of apple. Sweet, spicy, bready. Exciting.
Sugarysweet, the raisin is strong, a bit of cherry. The spicy notes come through next, pepper, clove. The maltiness is there too, not heavily roasted, T: Candy sugar sweetness up front mixing with boozy dark fruit - rum raisin, some black cherry too. Maybe its my palate, but I also think I taste a touch of citrus - some pineapple? Wouldn't be surprised if that ester arises from the Belgian yeast. Sweetness offset at first by some herbal spiciness - fresh pepper, cinnambut bready and rich. The alcohol is quite contained.
Oily, sticky, pleasant. Carbonation is strong -small bubbles, nice and tingly.
A booming Quad, fantastic, complex, deep and enjoyable. Highly recommended. Would love to drink this on a cool fall day, one after another. 971 charactersmhatters, Aug 09, 2009

I could smell the beer beer as soon as I poured it. Nice strong Belgian scent. Hey, what are these chunks of blackened yeast? you go in too. 
Kind of alcoholic at first, not too impressed...really starts to show up about 4 sips in, maybe I let it get to cold, maybe I just needed to get used to the alcohol. This is a sipper here. Tasty as hell, a little sweet, a little yeasty, a lot of other deliscousness that I can't describe.
I held off buying this for a while due to the price, but it's worth it. I've been working on this for 40 minutes now as I write this. I've got one sip left. That's got some staying power. I'd drink another if I had it, probably should not have bought this, cause now I know it's gonna become a rare/regular (the beer you pull out when it's been a lousy or special day, loosely defined so that each week will have at least one such day to ensure maximum beer exposure)
Late not: Apparently there were 2 sips left, this really a slow drinking beer. 1,044 charactersBeerCoffeeWater, Aug 08, 2009
4.85/5  rDev +8.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Rochefort 10 pours a deep ruby in a sniffer glass. The aroma of ripe figs, raisins, dark fruit and slight dark chocolate leads to a great finish. Nice and dry; exceptionally not overwhelming for the taste buds.
For the novice: Expect a flood of ripeness, but the body is surprising light. Yet again, this is a sipping brew. Best bet is simply enjoying it alone at first.
Personally: This is one of my personal cherished beers. I like to have a bottle every year to age for the next holiday season. Rochefort 10 is a testament to the excellence and taste supremacy of Belgian beers. 583 charactersWCBCFrank, Aug 07, 2009

Would be an easy 5 if it didn't look like someone dumped sawdust in my beer. Smell is sweet dark fruits, rubbing alcohol, grape juice. A little hot but still nice.
The first time I drank this beer I had only been into craft beer for a month or two. I remember thinking it was WAAYY too hot and I didn't like it really at all. It will be interesting to see how I feel about it now....
...ok, taking my first sip the alcohol heat is not nearly as bad as I remember it. There is still a slight burn, but at 11% I think I will give it a pass. The flavors underneath the alcohol are nice, but not really mind blowing. A bit of raisin and fig, some woodiness....and after a few more sips the alcohol is starting to get really annoying. It is not overwhelming but it makes up far too much of the flavor profile and hides the good stuff. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, drinkability suffers greatly from the booziness.
It is often stated that this beer is equal or superior to Westy 12 but I don't agree with that one bit. In fact, I would go so far as to say it shouldn't be even be mentioned in the same sentence as St. Bernardus 12 or Pannepot. I'm not trying to trash it because it surely is a high quality beer, but it is not world class according to my palate. 1,416 charactersalcstradamus, Aug 07, 2009

A-- dark, dark brown with a tan head. Head was 1 inch and quickly faded. Good amount of carbonation with the beer. Was amazed by how dark the beer was. Made me salivate in excitement.
S-- Burnt sugar, figs, vanilla, and alcohol. Lots of alcohol. The more it warmed the more apparent the alcohol became. 
T-- candied sugar and alcohol. Well carbonated but I said several times in lunch that this was so not what I expected and was just tasting the alcohol
M-- Overly sweet and too much alcohol. There was such a burn with this it was just hard to drink. The warmer it got th worse the burn was. Too heavy for me I think.
D-- One was enough.
I will be honest as I have sat on these notes for 3 weeks now. I feel guilty for even writing this. So many good reviews and I just flat out was unhappy with this beer. ABV was too high for me I think. I will try the 8 and try this again. It may not be a beer that just suits me and that I get. I got too much alcohol and it was a total turn off to me. 1,030 charactersmulder1010, Aug 05, 2009

Smells of port, brandy, raisins, some caramel action. Like deglazing a pan of raisinets with a 10 year old tawny port wine.
Tastes of dark sugars, figs, raisins, heavy and sticky. Use your imagination for heavy and sticky, some things can't be untyped.
The only bit of alcohol you detect is that creeping, lingering warmth that runs down your throat. 
Overall a great beer, I wish the trappistes rocheforts went up to 11, that would be cool. 596 charactersMurchmac, Aug 04, 2009

This baby pours, literally, diarrhea brown. no seriously, it looks like the toilet water after a night of WAAAY too many beers. however, once you get that image out of your mind, the look is not all that bad, and a nice foamy tan head graces the top. the smell is wonderful: burnt brown sugar, candy/fruit sweetness.
The flavor really is great. apple-cideresque with hints of other, darker fruits and a sugary sweetness. burnt maltiness in the finish that leaves you reaching for another sip. the belgian yeast blends nicely with these flavors and doesn't overwhelm them as it does, in my opinion, with so many other belgians.
full-bodied and smooth on the palate with truly wonderful drinkability. 742 charactersjdklks, Aug 03, 2009

T: Follows the smell. Sweet, but not overwhelmingly. Also some moderate bitterness in the aftertaste.

A - Huge four-finger head that recedes slowly to about a quarter-inch cap, fluffy lacing leaving nice rings down the glass.
S - Plenty of toasty fruit -- berries, cherries, and melon. Maybe a hint of burnt sugar and some breadiness.
T - Wow, lots of fruit here. Blueberries, raspberries, black cherries, and caramel. Outstanding flavor, and I can't say that I notice the alcohol one bit, which is an achievement considering the ABV.
M - Silky smooth, carbonation is just right, and the finish is long and pleasant.
D - Well, I'm pretty warm after the first one. I really want to open the second, but... ok, maybe I'll wait. The more time goes by the more I realize that the ABV is taking hold and is probably the only reason that I won't be having more today.
Overall -- wow, this is one helluva good beer. If it wasn't so expensive and it wasn't quite so hard to find, I'd be drinking this a lot more often. 968 charactersdjmichaelk, Jul 30, 2009

A very malty, under-carbonated beer for the belgian style. I do like the alcohol taste in a quad which was apparent. The euro barley was also there along with the european hop addition. I did like the yeast sediment like a homebrew and which that more beers should show their background every once in a while. It just tasted like a double wiezenbock. I wasn't as impressed as I thought I'd be. 547 charactersKCHopHead, Jul 29, 2009
4.08/5  rDev -8.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Pours an almost purple colour, red-brown but dark, with very nice burnt sienna-hued head and very good retention, made of small but visible bubbles. Lacing is sticky and delightful, seems to have some hazy in the glass as well. What a pile of deliciousness.
Nose is sweet and delectable, with a large berry hit - raspberry, blueberry and strawberry with a slight tang to it, and a mild hit of bitter from some slightly resiny hops. Rich and dark, but still very sweet overall, pleasant aroma indeed.
Taste is dark and brooding, with a raisiny syrupy sweetness coming to the fore with hints of figs and red grape skin. Has a slightly ashy bitterness towards the back, quite phenolic (in fact a lot of phenols throughout) with a noticeable tickle of alcohol that gives it a whisky character which is by no means a bad thing. Potent phenolic finish with a lovely warming sensation to cap off a sweet but brooding front palate.
Mouthfeel is nicely full, definitely slightly burning towards the back but I just like it, and it leaves very cleanly with a nice, lightly bitter finish. Overall it's not overwhelmingly drinkable because of that alcomohol but enjoyable as a good scotch and nicely Belgian in complexity. 1,213 characterslaituegonflable, Jul 29, 2009

Rich, musty aromas on the nose, not unlike an attic filled with abandoned, outdated chocolate bars. Sweetness, and a light acidity or oakiness peeking through. Even some dark acidic fruitiness perhaps, like cherries or tamarillo. Yum.
Taste is smooth, rich and complex. Not particularly sweet, like the nose might have suggested. Here, we get some dark aromatic, boozy characters, slightly rough around the edges, but brooding and rebellious. Certainly a kick of alcohol to this, and the complex amalgam of booze, light acidity, deep roasted sweetness and the silky feel make this an almost overwhelming experience. Yee ha! What a great beer.
A very, very pleasant and very, very drinkable beer, especially considering its ABV. Very slick, very complex, and amazingly enjoyable. Thankyou laituegonflable for slapping me in the face with this one! 1,045 characterslacqueredmouse, Jul 28, 2009
4.08/5  rDev -8.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Small 11.2 bottle with a basic looking light tan colored label. In the middle of this label is a white 10 in a blue oval. Directly to the left of the 10 is some kind of bin number. Whatever this number is, it has to use to the consumer. Along with the bin number is all the mandatory US information and the Trappist seal. In case you have a bottle with no label, you can also tell this is a 10 because of the white 10 on the purple cap.
Appearance: A Trappist beer deserves a special glass, so I poured this Belgian beer into my long stemmed Kasteel Chalise. I've seen strong murky beers before, but this one takes the murky cake. This beer was so damn murky that it looked to pour a faint black color, but after holding this beer into the light for quite some time, I found out that it was more of a murky chestnut brown color. It was one of those tricky appearances. It makes you think it's one color, but when you inspect it a little more, Bam! It's a whole new color. Sitting patiently on top of this beer was a thick foamy head of foam. This head of foam was at least 1 inch in height and off white in color. It had kick ass retention that left behind an ever lasting skim of foam and quite a few blots and streaks of lace. As you can tell from my score, I absolutely loved the color, the murkyness, and even the head of foam.
Smell: As soon as I popped off the cap, I received a strong whiff of raisins and unrestricted alcohol. When it was poured into the Chalise, those aromas were still there, but they calmed down a bit. The aroma of 10 was dry with raisins, plums, a fig or two, a tiny speck of roasted malts, alcohol, and then this aroma finishes up with a subtle whiff of Belgian candi sugar. It was a nice dry aroma, but I would have liked it more if they pumped up the scent of sugar a bit. If you think this high ABV% beer is going to be sweet in the nose, you would be wrong.
Taste: This Trappist beer starts off with a few dark fruits like raisins, figs, and plums. Then like a 10 pound hammer slamming down on a 1 oz. nail, in comes the alcohol. This strong taste of alcohol lasts for a about a minute and then it rolls into a subtle dryness with the taste of dry roasted malts. I thought the taste was over and done, but then my tongue found a teeny tiny touch of Belgian candi sugar. I guess it could have been easier to just say that the taste mirrored the aroma, but where would be the fun in that?
Mouthfeel: When I read on the label that this beer had a 11.3% ABV, I originally thought that it was going to be a full bodied beer and all the alcohol was going to knock me on my ass after a few sips. That of course never happened. I found out that 10 was more of a medium bodied of beer, but the one thing I couldn't help but notice was the fact how well this beer masked its alcohol content. I could taste some of it in the taste, but I couldn't feel it. The aftertaste of 10 was on the dry side with the taste of dry roasted malts, alcohol, and dark fruits.
Drinkability: After drinking this beer, I could tell that they sunk more money into the beer then the label artwork. It's clearly not a cheap beer, but if you ever want to try well hidden high ABV% beer, then you should try a Rochefort 10. For me, I would like to give this beer another try. 3,280 charactersAltBock, Jul 27, 2009

A- An agressive pour leaves a decent head in a wide-mouth snifter. Deep, dark mahogany in color.
S- Candied fruits, figs or dates come to mind. Red plum skin is there, as well as a faint alcoholic note. Very sweet, very inviting. Smells like a port.
T- Tart, tangy, not at all sweet. Incredible depth. OK, sweetness is there, just handled in a way I didn't expect. The alcohol is only known as a warming on the back of the mouth. Malts provide a wonderful body for this wonderful beer. I am amazed at the subtlety and complexity of this beer. I won't pretend to be able to fully describe this beer... although I can assure you it is awesome. 
M- Fantastic. 5 of 5. Incredible depth. Drying, sweet but subtle, malty, rich, and delicious. I cannot say enough good things about this beer. 
D- Moderate. 11.3% is up at the high end, but this beer earns points for being such a damn fine sippin' beer.
All in all, a lot more than the Rochefort 8. And I love the 8. This one steps everything I liked about the 8 up in a big way, while not overloading the tongue. What's amazing about this beer is how bold it is in mouthfeel, aroma, and character while providing a subduded sweetness. A true artisan beer and one I won't think twice about buying a boatload of. 1,335 charactersShogoKawada, Jul 25, 2009

5/5  rDev +11.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I've had this beer many many times in the past but never thought to rate it. Bottle from liquor shop around the corner. Poured into a WestMalle glass. Pours an opaque dark brown colour, with lively carbonation and a nice lasting white head. The sediment doesn't fall to the bottom of the glass, but stays in there floating. Funny. 
The scent is, like most quads, very complex. A bit like sour cherry, alcohol, spicy yeast, and above all, fruits. 
The taste is very similar to the smell, but went above and beyond. Incredibly complex. Wow wow wow. What a beer. Roasted and caramel malts, chocolate, fruits (plums, raisins and maybe some citrus??), mildly spicy yeast and some tones of alcohol (surprisingly low for a beer with more than 11% alcohol content). The taste is similar to, but much less sweet that the St. Bernardus 12.
The mouthfeel is fantastic too. Rich and creamy, impressively balanced. Medium-high carbonation.
Overall, one of the best quads out there! It is important though to let the beer warm up a bit, so all the flavours are fully released! 1,066 charactersrvdoorn, Jul 24, 2009

S - I immediately smell alcohol, along with dark fruits such as cherry, date, and raisins. A floral scent is also apparent upon further smell.
T - The taste is very good, very Belgian. Dark malts are very apparent, as is the subtle notes of fruit, and surprisingly I taste bitter dark chocolate. Pair that along with a bit of the bitter hops and you have a very good tasting beer.
M - It is a rather dry beer, but not too dry. It balances nicely.
D - This was my first Trappist beer, and I must say I am very pleased. I highly recommend this to anyone who passes by it in the store, or sees it at the local pub. I could easily have 2-3 of these in one sitting. 875 charactersudu86922, Jul 23, 2009

S - Outstanding. Rich, sweet, and bitter at the same time. Lots of rich fruit aromas: Pear, grapefruit date, rasin. Malts are caramel with a fleeting cocoa. Never smelled this much in a beer before. 
T/M - Mildly biting carbonation delays the taste until it fills your mouth. The fruits aren't as powerful as in the scent. Pears and rasins again, but light and not as sweet. Hops are there enough to offset the sweetness. Warming up the carbonation fades some and the flavors come through more. Wonderfully light for it's richness.
D - Too wonderful to guzzle, and it hits like a rock. But it's sooo easy to drink. 770 charactersMunchkinDrinker, Jul 22, 2009

I could drink a few of these if I could afford it. This was my third trial of Rochefort 10 and while a liked it, I wanted to wait to make sure I wasn't missing something.

Pours a dark brown with a small light brown head that dissipates rather quickly.
Aroma of dark fruits, alcohol and sweet malts.
Taste is wood, dark fruits (figs, raisins, dates), dark malts and light sweetness. Alcohol comes through, though less than you would expect with the ABV. Nicely warming.
Mouthfeel is medium bodied and cleansing.
Overall, a deliciious brew. Perfect digestive. Wonderful example of the style. 455 charactersatigerlife, Jul 18, 2009
4.71/5  rDev +5.4%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.7511.2oz bottle poured into my St. Bernardus chalice.
A: Pop the cap and this Belgian started to force its way out of the bottle - the second time I've pulled an overcarbonated Belgian from the store. Murky, cloudy, muddy burgundy-brown body settling under a whipped, creamy off-white colored head that peaks at about a half finger's thickness only to quickly reside down to a ring of miniscule bubbles. Lacing creeps up the side of the glass with each sip.
S: Nose presents alot of dark fruit - raisins, plums, maybe even a hint of cherry. There is also a sugary, candy-like sweetness in the nose. A measure of spice adds some edge to the nose - some pepper, maybe a dash of cinnamon. A nice backdrop of warm, fresh-baked bread and honey from the malts follows the fruity sweetness. At the very end, alcohol fumes become present - slightly medicinal, stinging the nostrils.
T: Candy sugar sweetness up front mixing with boozy dark fruit - rum raisin, some black cherry too. Maybe its my palate, but I also think I taste a touch of citrus - some pineapple? Wouldn't be surprised if that ester arises from the Belgian yeast. Sweetness offset at first by some herbal spiciness - fresh pepper, cinnamon, cloves. Then the malts kick in and add more subtle layers beneath the sweetness - warm baked bread with butter and drizzled with honey, sweet cake, some nutty, buttery notes linger after each sip. Finish begins with a heavy, grainy, wheat husk flavor and a slight, pleasant burn from the alcohol as the glass warms and then ends with a plethora of fruity esters - raisin, maybe some pear too. Quite complex and I'm sure there are probably many more layers to be discovered on a second go-round.
M: At first, this quad it quite slick, almost sticky on the tongue as I swish it around. Then the mouthfeel goes slightly dry, powdery-like. Nice contrasts in the mouthfeel from the first second it hits the tongue to the swallow.
D: 11.3% ABV is noticeable both on the nose and the taste, especially as the glass warms to room temp. Even so, this quad is not hard to drink - its sweetness, smooth presence and massive complexities make this a luxurious treat. I think the factor that most impacts drinkability for me has nothing to do with the quality of the beer itself - it is simply that St. Bernardus Abt 12 is just as readily available, at a cheaper price/oz., and offers up its own share of complexities.
A premier Belgian Quad, and one that I am glad to have the opportunity to try since it is unlikely I'll get my hands on a Westy 12 in the foreseeable future. Massively complex flavor profile with a nice kick.  Closely comparable to the St. Bernardus Abt 12 in all aspects except for price. At $6.50 for a 11.2oz bottle of 10 vs $10.50 for a 750mL of the 12... the 12 gets the nod with my pocketbook.  Setting price considerations aside, however, I would say the Rochefort 10 just edges out the Abt 12 with a more complex, more layered palate on offer.  If money was no object, I think I'd splurge for the 10 over the Abt 12.  But since this is my overall assessment of the beer, and because price is one factor which inherently impact my ability to afford the beers I wish to enjoy, I can't help but factor that element into my final rating.  It is for that reason alone that I give the slightest of slight edges to the Abt 12.
Bottom line: the Rochefort 10 is a killer Quad, one I would love to enjoy again, one that is particularly appropriate for the most special of occasions. 3,492 charactersBuschyfor3, Jul 18, 2009
4.43/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5330ml bottle, a pleasant sight at a surprising number of liquor stores around town these days - nice.
This beer pours a dark chocolate-milk brown hue, with sediment reeling throughout, and two fingers of solid, yet airy beige head, which melts away at an even pace, leaving some low-slung mountain vista lace around the glass. 
It smells of floral, spiced orchard fruit, lemongrass, a subtle graininess, and mild citrus vodka. The taste is big sweet candy sugar malt, a hint of yeasty rising bread, dark fleshy fruits, soused orange, Turkish delight, and mild earthy, leafy hops. 
The carbonation is very laid back, rendering a cozily soft, creamy, and solid body, without allowing a drop-off into any sappy cloyingness. It finishes quite dry, with the floral candied fruit hanging on for good measure. 
In all this sturm und drang, one is left to wonder - where went the heat? Like its little brother, the 8, you have to reflect somewhat in order to detect the alcohol beyond a slight general warming. Perceived drinkability will not equal actual end-game drinkability with this one, of that I am certain. Still, drink this, just because you damned well can. 1,163 charactersbiboergosum, Jul 18, 2009

The head is massive, even and white. It takes a while before it dissipates and then there are very nice lacings left.
S: Since this beer is rahter strong (alcohol-wise) it's no surprise that you sence rather obvious alcohol, but there is also roasted malt, floral hops and some fruit (raisins).
T: The alcohol is present, as well as the roasted malt, but there is also caramell malt, sweetness, complexity and fruit (citrus). In no other beer I had earlier has the taste of dark bitter chocolate been so obvious.
The aftertaste is well balanced between the dryness and the sweetness. There is bitter hops and the aftertaste lasts all weekend.
M: Alcohol of course but this isn't just alcohol - it's very powerful and dry.
D: A fantastic beer, a fantastic Trappist-beer. Of all the Trappist-beers I had I guess the only ones that can compete with this one is Westmalle Dubbel and Tripel. If you find this one in the store or pub - BUY IT! 1,034 charactersEvil_Pidde, Jul 16, 2009

A: Decanted into my Chimay chalice, Rochefort 10 sits a deep ruby red with mahogany highlights. Very fine carbonation helps maintain a finger-thick head. Held against the light, this beer is gorgeous enough to don the cover of a mag. 
S: I can smell it a foot away and it's appealing as hell. A very deep and complex malty aroma comes through, with an intoxicating fig character, a bready backbone that lends depth and a mild and interesting cherry-like tartness. The combination of the fruit and the mild alcohol brings to mind a good Caribbean rum . A mild nutty aroma is also present. Exceptional in delicacy, depth and breadth.
T: The alcohol does dominate the palate, and leads the opening salvo. The flavors that follow behind run the gamut, from fruity to dark caramel, to mildly earthy with a surprising hint of mushrooms. Mildly spicy as well, with a mild anise and mace character. The aforementioned mushroom character is rather strange, and I'm wondering if I'm misidentifying something. Finishes dry and warming. With close to 2 years on it, it still tastes a little hot
M: Very light and airy in body, the fine carbonation further accentuates the lightness of this beer. Finishes dry and spicy with a combination of anise and alcohol
D: Halfway through my glass, my head is starting feel the effects. This semi-warm summer night is not ideal conditions for a boozy quad, but this is still very enjoyable.
**Edit 26 May 2012**
Brad gave me a bottle as an extra in a trade a few years back, best by 24 November 2009. That puts this at just shy of 8 years.
The nose is excellent. It's got a blend of cola, burnt sugar, brown sugar, a little bit of hazelnut liqueur (Frangelico?). Alcohol has finally simmered down. A blend of sherry and cola comes to mind. 
The palate opens with a lot of dark fruit - plums, some raisins, some sherry, again, a little cola. Some mild nuttiness. The spice character has mellowed, and allowed the fruit to come to the forefront. Fairly dry, the finish has flavors of almonds, cola and sherry. Excellent.

The body is dark amber in the light, brown otherwise. The pour is outstanding with a light brown head huge that stays forever. When it does fall it does so in chunks and is beautiful. The lace is great and sticks all over the glass. There is yeast all over the glass and adds to a stunning look.
It smells of dried fruits, alcohol and chocolate.
The taste is phenomal. It is a balance of chocolate, coffee and alchol.
This is the best beer in the world. 560 charactersjrallen34, Jul 11, 2009

4.87/5  rDev +8.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Revision, all right, I'm a jackass, the review below was for a beer that was consumed way to cold. Tonight I took a St. Bernardus 12 and a Rochefort 10 out of the fridge at the same time, opened both, drank the Bernardus first, then about 15 minutes later poured the Rochefort. Awesome, simply awesome, disserves all accolades, simply, best beer I've ever had. If Westy 12 is better (I've never had it) then it truly must be the best beer on earth. The 10 has an incredible nose, rich flavor, and a great finish.
DO NOT drink this beer ice cold, let it warm, my god what a reward.
---
Ok, finally opened my first Rochefort 10. Now I need to make one admission, I believe I drank this beer too fast as the last sips (after the beer has warmed a bit) were different from the first. I had high expectations for this beer at the outset having tried the 6 and the 8 beforehand. This bottle "expires" December 31st of 2013 so it was definitely on the fresh side.
Appearance: Like its siblings it pours a murky dark brown into a Chimay Chalice. More head both at first and as it settles than the 6 or 8. The lacing is by far the best of the 3. Heavy, heavy, sediment (as is the style).
Smell: Complex but less so than the 8, not as much depth. Does not strike the nose like the 8. 
Taste: Very good, again deep & rich but with the warmth of the extra alcohol. The flavors are more subtle as if fighting to get through the warmth of the alcohol. Rich beer and again (to beat the dead horse) very warm. 
Mouth feel: Smooth and well carbonated and improves as the beer warms over time.
Drinkability : Sessionable, and a wonderful session it would be, but a crime to drink fast this beer should be served warmer I would let it sit for 15 minutes out of the fridge before you open it and then drink it slow.
This is very good beer. My first impression is "very, very, good" but the 8 was "incredible". I immediately followed the 10 by pouring another 8 and it confirmed my judgment. The 8 is a world class beer and the 10 is an excellent beer. Frankly, I wanted the 10 to be better than the 8, but it isn't. A very good beer truly, but the ABV gets in the way in the 10 that it does not in the 8. I have 5 more bottles that I will let age in my cellar and report on changes over time. In the near term I will try another 10 (the sixth in the cellar)that I will let warm a little first. Finally, a store in the area has the 8 for $3.29 a bottle I am going there and buying every last bottle they have. I will put the "warmed" 10 head-to-head with the St. Bernardus Abt 12 shortly (and include the 8 in the session) I'll revise my review if necessary. 2,646 charactersBobZ, Jul 11, 2009
4.64/5  rDev +3.8%look: 5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Pours perfectly with massive amounts of light tan head, which sticks around for a good spell. The body is dark brown and murky, also does not allow light to pass through at all. Lacing sticks well all the way through to the end of the 33cl serving.
Aroma is sweet and bready. A slight hint of lemon hops character is moderately detectable.
Taste wise it's a medley of flavors just like its weaker sister. Dark fruits such as prunes and raisons are immediate. A little citrusy in the middle and a blunt finish from the high ABV incorporated into this brew.
The mouthfeel is full in body and prickly with all of the carbonation. It's a little syrupy all the way through and finishes with the typical alcohol warmth.
This si a very complex and thought provoking brew, nice to sip on and relax with a fine peaceful evening. 823 charactersTheSarge, Jul 06, 2009
4.08/5  rDev -8.7%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured a very dark brown that was mostly opaque unless held up to the light. Very clingy 1/4" head that left some nice lacing the whole way down.
Smell was fruity and earthy. Pleasant, but I was hoping for more.
Taste was exceptional. Raisins, and other vinous tastes. A spicy almost red bell pepper taste is evident as well as a little kick of warming alcohol. The sweetness of candy sugar is also there but only for a moment.
Mouthfeel was medium bodied. I definately can't drink more than 1 of these without feeling the buzz. Another good beer I'll have to try again. 573 characterssnpub540, Jul 06, 2009

The aroma consists of floral, dark fruits and raisins. Very well done.
Whoa! I was expecting a sweet taste but am met with a somewhat bland bitter taste. I don't taste much of what I smelled. There is almost a numbing after the swallow on my inner gums. Pepper-ish characteristics as well. Warming alcohol is noticable.
Creamy mouthfeel with a little foam on each sip.
Drinkability is somewhat low as it would be extremely difficult to consume much more than one because of the high alcohol.
I was really, really hoping for more from this beer as it rates so high from other consumers. I was fairly disappointed by the taste when the smell was so pleasing. I would get again but at almost $8 a pop, my money would go elsewhere first. 891 characterskaseydad, Jul 03, 2009

Appearance: Tan head on a dark brown/black body. Carbonation is nice, more than I expected.
Smell: Pungeant mess of fruits. Raisins, plums, melons. 
Taste: Yeast gives it a nice spiciness, and also gives it a little bit of doughy flavor in my opinion. The fruits that are present in the smell aren't as big in the taste.

I've come across the #10 in the store but never picked it up, but after seeing it was rated the #1 beer in the world by this fine website and magazine, I just had to try it.
Appearance: Dark brown, almost black with tints of red. Light tan head that doesn't stick around.
Smell: Lots of dark fruits on the nose with just a small amout of sweet malts. Maybe even a hint of candied sugar...damn i'm excited to drink this! 
Taste: Now I know why this incredible brew was rated of #1! Once again lots of dark fruits, sugary raisin flavors mixed with sweet malts, plums and even a hint of fresh grape, with just a slight hint of alcohol on the backend. 
Mouthfeel: Very smooth, easy drinking, surprising for a Quad.
I am so glad that I finally drank what can only be descibed as a "nectar of the gods". When I die and if there is a heaven and for some reason St. Peter opens the pearly gates for me, I can only hope that this beer is available. But if I have to head in the opposite direction for eternity, maybe the ruler of the underworld will have a few cellered that he would be willing to part with. 1,174 charactersbrewbasterd, Jul 01, 2009
4.53/5  rDev +1.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Approx. 55 degrees, in a snifter
A gentle pour produces a two finger head of lather-like foam above a nearly opaque, reddish brown, thickly made, beauty of a beer. The head recedes very slowly and leaves clouds of lace on my snifter.
The nose is a heavenly vapor of alcohol, caramel, dark fruit, mild spice, subtle bitter, and other wonderful aromas for which I lack the palate to describe. It's not as strong a scent as ABT 12, but at least as delicious.
The taste is a remarkable invasion of delicious flavor. It is an alive explosion of caramel, plum, earth, sweet alcohol warmth, mild yeast notes with a subtle, pleasing sourness, and a plethora of spicy, bitter, perfectly chosen and balanced undernotes that dance through it all, and round it into a spectacular finish of fruit, alcohol, herbosity, and bitter. It is complex, and wonderful, what a marvelous brew.
Judging mouthfeel for style I would say this is the benchmark. Full bodied and resinous for a looong finish, very clean, clears out, light in the mouth, even refreshing for a beer that is a sipper.
Drinkability, considering style, is spectacular. I have finished the 11.2 ounces in the time it has taken to form this review. 1,199 characterscavedave, Jun 28, 2009

3.92/5  rDev -12.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 2I think this beer is a bit overrated, but the last two times I've had it it was so bad I decided to hold judgement. 
You have to drink this one just under room temperature, else it is like syrup. Then it tastes right.
A - Black with candy brown at the edges. Really too dark for a quad, which in my opinion should be a nice translucent candy brown, like brown sugar. Don't forget the floaties, either, which i don't like in my beer. They look like fond, the little burnt bits that get left on a skillet, which indicates a pretty killer decoction mash, or if they are bits of husk, sloppy sparging. In spite of some zealous carbonation, the slightly starchy, milk chocolate-like head disipates quicky.
T & S - It almost approaches a "beer liquor" in terms of taste and smell, indicating an excessive amount of the monk-famous candi sugar used, probably 15%-20% of the fermentables. You've got your industry standard dark fruits and spices in there, dry maltiness, and stale hops (not a bad thing for this style). Muted and a bit cheesy, I'd say Styrian Goldings and some Hallertaur. Close your eyes and you can imagine the minute amounts of corriander they've said they put in there. This all wafts up thru your nose carried on warm, undulating wings of alcohol. Feels like you're holding a shot of cheap toffe-flavored liquor up to your nose at times, if not for the complexity of the whole thing.
M &D - Thick and syrupy on the one hand, and paradoxically thin on the other. The tons of carbonation really bring this beer to life, otherwise it's like a flat, beery brandy or whisky. Which is unfortunate because it all escapes VERY fast (probably at least in part due to the beer needing a warm serving temperature) so you're kind of forced to choke this 11.5% fucker down. Drinking it becomes a race against equilibrium thermodynamics. I wish it would stay around longer, I was starting to enjoy it. Mabye it would benefit from a chilled glass. 
The guys at Rochefort really should let this one age for awhile before shipping it out, they are really shooting themselves in the foot by shipping it out so young. I read that this one goes from grain to bottle in 3 weeks! All the elements of a great beer are there but they are just so disseperate that it's a little like trying to piece together a puzzle. 2,311 charactersericduran, Jun 27, 2009

I received a bottle as a gift and poured into my trappistes rochefort chalice. The color is a dark amber with about a half inch head, I pour the whole bottle so there is noticeable sediment. The smell is like Christmas morning, a sweet blend of clove, anise, dried fruit, and alcohol. The taste evolves with every sip, with a masterful blend of raisin, plum, clove, anise, among other spices, and a warming alcohol finish. It's truly one of the few beers that seem to evolve with each sip. The mouthfeel is soft and smooth, a little on the chewy side. The high alcohol content is expertly masked by all the sweetness and complex flavors. There is just so much to say about this beer and yet words really fail to do it the proper justice it deserves. To me, the Rochefort 10 is the gold standard by which all beers are measured, yet none can live up to. Drink in good health, friends. Prost! 999 charactersicemanrulz, Jun 27, 2009

3.93/5  rDev -12.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5This is probably the highest rated beer I have ever had to date. I had the Rochefort 8 yesterday and enjoyed it quite a bit. Here is my review of the 10:
A: Pours a murky brown color with a nice frothy tan head. Lacing is very thick. Head just sticks around. I think this one is a little darker than the 8. There is also quite a bit of brown sediment, not only in the beer itself, but in the head also. 
S: Smells similar to the 8, but I get a much more pronounced red wine aroma. Lots of dark fruits. Alcohol is very pronounced as well. Kind of burns the nose a little.
T: First couple sips are quite overpowering. Tastes exactly like a red wine with a major alcohol aftertaste. But, once you get past that, there is some major flavor complexity here. For starters, this is on the sweet side. The first thing you will taste is the dark fruit, lots of currants, plums, cherry and figs. There are toffee notes in there as well. The spices are very prominent and intermingle with the major alcohol profile in the finish. 
M: Medium bodied. Somewhat dry finish. Quite a bit of alcohol burn. Other than the alcohol in the finish, it is a very smooth beer overall.
D: This is a sipper. No question about it. Very rich and drinks more like a wine than a beer. This is a beer you only drink on special occasions. I couldn't imagine drinking this more than one or two times the whole year. 
I have to admit, this is probably the most wine-like beer I have ever had. The alcohol astringency in the finish is probably the biggest deterrent for me. Other than that, this is probably one of the most complex beers around and is worth trying at least once. I personally found the Rochefort 8 a little more drinker friendly. Check em both out if you can. Recommended. 1,759 charactersOldSchoolGamer, Jun 23, 2009

4.15/5  rDev -7.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured from a chilled bottle into room temp goblet.
Pours a murky reddish-brown with a thin scrim of cream colored head. Lots of floaties in here. This is what the bottom of the nile looks like during flood season. 
Aromas of plums and other dark fruits. Spices on top of faint fumes of alcohol. Esters and the faintest scent of cream (for some reason...)
Tastes like a great quad! Lots of dark fruit and wine-like goodness up front. A light but well balanced back end consisting of hops and alcohol. Faintly warming, but refreshing at the same time.
The mouthfeel is ok, but I would love to have just a bit more carbonation. That would fill out the body just a bit and really round this out for me. The tastes do a good job of lightly coating and not overpowering.
Overall drinkability is good for an imported quad. The only thing really keeping me from drinking this regularly is availability and price.
If you can find it, buy it and set it aside for a special occasion. 979 charactersKlgkenny, Jun 22, 2009

The aroma is a rich blend of spices with a chocolately malt. Fruits like banana, apple, pear, and dried apricots, raisins.
The flavour of this beer is the real spotlight. The alcohol is very well hidden, the most of any quad I've tasted. Much more fruity and less of a roasted/burnt flavour than a Westy or St. Bernardus. Complexity comes with the spicey character. Like baked banana bread, spicey gingerbread cookies. Chocolate. Expresso even. Bitter and dry in the finish.

4.52/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Finally got a chance to try this after some anticipation. She pours a mahogany brown with a nice haze. Two finger head that runs away too quickly. Lacing is nice and leggy.
The smell and taste are both representative of what seperates a quad from a belgian strong dark. This thick maltiness with a sweetness that doesn't hide behind, but rather plays beside, some nice abbey yeastiness.
The mouthfeel is perfection for the style, perfect amount of carbonation plays with the thick body to hide any presence of alcohol. Incredible.
The drink is as easy as any brew of this magnitude. Very nice. Well played sirs. 614 charactersgrayburn, Jun 14, 2009
4.75/5  rDev +6.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5GLASS: Tulip
TEMP: Cellared @ approx 45 degres
BOTTLE DATED: 16/04/13 (Best Before)[Approx 14 months aged]
Pours a very dark garnet color. Three-finger head of light brown foam. Retention is very good. Lacing is thick, but slippery, leaving an oily sheen on the sides of the glass.
A beautiful nose, indeed. Big notes of brown sugars and caramel malts. Figs, dates, plums and cherries are among the dark fruits present in this glass. Light notes of vanilla, spices candi sugars and sweet molasses.
Very complex and appealing nose.
As far as I'm concerned, forget the 6 and 8. Rochefort 10 is where it's at. Damn, that's a great brew.
Huge dark fruit notes dominate. Raisins, figs, plums, cherries, and more. Every sip seems to bring something new. Wonderful malty backbone. Caramel, brown sugar, light molasses and toffees. Toasted nuts. Great spice presence. Belgian candi sugars. There's so much going on in this brew.
This is a flavor-bomb of a beer and that's just what I like. This is NOT for the meak!
Nicely full-bodied. Nicely creamy, yet very smooth and easy-to-drink. Medium, almost high, level of carbonation, which is just about perfect, for this one.
While the 11.30%ABV is noticed, in the feeling department, it certainly doesn't seem that big in the flavor department. This is such a well-balanced brew. Very drinkable, especially in the land of Quads. The high ABV keeps it from a perfect score for drinkability, but I wouldn't change a thing about this one.
One of my all-time favorites. 1,509 characterscoldmeat23, Jun 07, 2009
4.35/5  rDev -2.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured into a St. Bernardus Goblet from an 11.2 oz bottle.
A: Dark Mahogony with a slight brownish grey head that lasts the whole way down, very little lacing, some floaties
S: LET THIS BEER WARM UP! Dark fruits, green raisins, plums, dates and some apple esthers, very complex, I'm picking up some booziness at first which blends in nicely as it warms
M: Very highly carbonated but it smooths out over the palate, dry finish and slightly chalky with some alcohol warmness at the end
T: Earthy, grassy to begin with, but as it smooths out in the mouth, a very complex flavor profile; raisins, dark fruit and some bitter chocoalte. 
D: I could drink a few of these. The alcohol is hidden so very well. A real pleasure to taste. However, I prefer the St. Bernardus Abt 12 to this one. It just seems a bit more chewy with more of a dark fruit and spice that I prefer. Overall this is still a world class Quad. 911 charactersjdflyer06, Jun 06, 2009
4.12/5  rDev -7.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured from a bottle into my DFH snifter.
A - Dark brown/charcoal color with an ashy-grey head. Pretty sticky head that leaves some decent lacing along the sides of the glass.
S - Dark fruit, berries, sugars, malts, some alcohol booze as well. Overall, very sweet on the nose.
T - Not as sweet as the nose. Some dark fruits, roasted nuts, and malts. I can taste the alcohol, but not overpowering at all.
M - Light to medium in body, fizzy carbonation which works well with this beer, dry finish.
D - Easy to drink but probably just once in a while for me. I prefer the Westy 12 to this one, although this is a good Quad. 625 charactersSean9689, Jun 04, 2009

A: Pours a dark brown color with a small tan head. The head does not last long before it settles into a thick outer ring with a few patches of bubbles that almost look like oil slicks on the surface. The bubbles try to leave some lacing but it just slides down the glass.
S: There is a big aroma coming from this brew. There is quite a big sweet dark fruit aroma that seems to be dominated by raisin.
T: The flavor packs a hell of a punch. Its big and aggressive. Loads of dark fruit flavor. Figs and raisins mixed with Belgian yeast and caramel sweetness. There is a bit of spice to it as well. It is a great tasting brew for those that like big flavors like me.
M: The carbonation is a little more aggressive than I would care for in this style at the initial sip. It mellows out relatively quickly, but then almost feels a bit watery instead of more of a medium body at initial sip.
D: This one is a sipper for sure. The ABV and huge flavor punch make sure that it is a brew that goes down slowly. 1,097 charactersGatorBeerNerd, Jun 02, 2009

Smells heavily with a variety of dark fruits, some sweet malts, and chocolate.
Taste resonates heavily with dark fruit, malt, a little yeast, and hints of some cherries.
Finish is crisp with a wonderful after-taste featuring cherries and malt.
Incredibly drinkable, the dark fruit really smooths out the 11.3%. Great drinker. 414 charactersThaBobfather, Jun 02, 2009

Pours a dark reddish brown with an off-white active head. Smell is amazing. Smells of sweet malts with a fruity vanilla undertone. Taste is sweet malted goodness with great balancing hops. Mouthfeel is medium/heavy with surprisingly higher carbonation. Drinkabiliy is unmatched. I could one or many of these. 
Overall this beer is great. I would drink it any day. 408 charactersBeerStine, Jun 02, 2009
4.6/5  rDev +2.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Poured into a Trappistes Rochefort chalice with a nice bubbly and sticky head. Liquid was deep dark brown with an almost ruby tinge around the egdes. Lacing stuck around til the end and was splendously sticky.
There was a full grainy sweetness to the smell like the smell of brown sugar or maybe even molasses though not too strong by any means. There was a pleasant spicy phenolic smell, a hint of berry and just a touch of chocolate. All in all very appetising. 
Taste didn't dissapoint. Sweetness was hitting the tastebuds but it definitely wasn't overpowering. Had that molasses quality to it. Very nice dark malt flavours edging towards the chocolate side of things. The berry flavours mingled around coming in and out of perception and there was a spicy phenolic flavour which was noticeable but definitely not overpowering that became most noticeable towards the end and lingered for a while. 11.3% alcohol? Where was it? If it didn't make me giddy so quicky I wouldn't have guessed it. 
Smooth, low carbonated in a good way, went down very easily. I guess you'd say it was medium bodied. The smooth creaminess dominates the mouthfeel.
I had to finish this beer in a rush as my company had to leave in a hurry. I got to enjoy maybe 2/3 of my bottle before I got rushed. You'd think it would be a task to rush an 11.3%abv quad but it wasn't the case, I just felt terrible as it seemed such a waste for such a fine beer. But this really went down so well, so smoothly and so easily with so many delightful and complex flavours. Nearly no bitterness but it got away with it, the malty flavours being dark and subtle enough to not really require that hops balance. Definitely going to be re drinking this when I have more time on my hands. A delight.
edit/ just tried this again in better circumstances, and sipping it slowly I find it amazing how smooth it goes down and how well the booze is hidden. Definitely the most drinkable quad I've come across so far. 1,969 charactersStavage, May 31, 2009
4.73/5  rDev +5.8%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Appearance - Pours a dark brown color with a tan foamy 3 finger head which sticks to the side of the glass.
Smell - sweet aroma of candy sugar, plums, other fruit, and malt. Also has a strong aroma of alcohol.
Taste - Sugar, caramel, fruit and alcohol are the most dominant flavors. Has a sweet aftertaste. Is easy to drink even with the noticeable amount of alcohol present.
Mouthfeel - Smooth, creamy, full bodied with a sweet aftertaste.
Drinkability - Drinkability is great, but you don't want to session drink this due to the high alcohol. 548 charactershardy008, May 31, 2009

Poured into my Duvel Tulip with a 3 finger head that lingers awhile. Smell is great with Dark fruits and sweet malts dominating. Taste is so very complex and wonderous. Raisins, plums, figs and spices are everywhere in a good way! Mouthfeel is similair to Abt 12 in this category. Drinkability is much better than expected from such a high ABV beer. You could definitely have more than one of these in a session!!! 469 charactersdublife1, May 30, 2009
4.77/5  rDev +6.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Wow. I can't believe I stumbled upon this lone bottle at my Bev Mo. Digging through some shelves of Westmalle and this pops up. What a treat.
Small 11.3 bottle poured into a snifter glass
The poured yielded a very dark brown with ruby hues around the edges. Pour also gave way to a beautiful 2 finger ivory cap that dissipated slowly to a small rim around the edges of my glass. This is alot darker than I had expected.
Aromas have a huge range with this one. It goes from cloves, pepper, and bready to plums, raisins, and dark sugar with heavy yeast scents present throughout the entire ride.
Now for the ultimate test...and it delivered in spades. Begins with a slight alcohol sting on the very tip of the tongue. Just enough to give me notice, but not so strong and overpowering. Now we move to plum and yeast notes tagging behind the prickly alcohol and carbonation accompanied by dark caramel, rum, and molasses. Finish was extremely smooth. Hides the alcohol presence very well.
Mouthfeel was full bodied and viscous creating a nice slick coat in the mouth. Some may disagree with me, but I think it was just a wee bit too carbonated. Regardless of that, it was still fantastic.
Huge props for drinkability. The abundant carbonation makes this beer harder to resist from just merely sipping.
All in all, this was a damn good Quadrupel and I'm thrilled to have tried this. 1,384 charactersFoxtrot, May 29, 2009

4.67/5  rDev +4.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Picked this bottle up at a Wine and Beer shop not too far from my house--was quite happy to see it there.
Don't have a chalice or a snifter so I poured this into the closest thing I could find: a Bordeaux glass. 
A: The pour is a beautiful dark-reddish brown that yields over half on inch of an incredible fluffy brown head that laces well and slowly fades to a slim film over the top of the beer that retains the whole way through. Certainly a good looking quad--my only regret is not having my Chimay goblet or even a more suitable one such as a Rochefort glass itself. Next time I'll be sure to do so. Additionally, there are some chunks of yeast sediment floating around.
S: The nose on this brew is relatively subdued. There's a noticeable alcohol undertone that briefly overshadows the dark fruit notes that eventually become more prominent. Raisin and date are certainly the most forthcoming. Dark roasted malts and chocolates make a brief appearance, too.
T: I think one of the most beautiful things about a great belgian quad such as this one is how, as it warms slightly, it grows more and more complex. I poured it far colder than I ought to have--pulling it from the fridge and letting it sit for merely 10 minutes before drinking. Initially the alcohol provides a backdrop for the brew, just as the nose advertises. As the beer warms those alcohol notes begin to disappear as they are overshadowed by mild spice notes and the obvious raisin, date, and dark fruit notes. Even dark chocolate makes an appearance. This is another great beer that reaffirms my love of belgian quads.
The mouthfeel is medium bodied and the beer is lightly carbonated. Drinkability is far greater than I initially expected--it puts other belgian quads to shame, almost, in that regard. 
All in all, this is a delicious beer--a spectacular belgian quad that I'll continue to purchase for years to come. If you haven't tried it: do. 1,925 charactersoriginalsin, May 26, 2009
4.18/5  rDev -6.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 411.2 oz bottle
A: Dark black body under a small off white head. Even for a quad, I think this is an unusually dark body. Some decent lace and retention.
S: Fruity, boozy, bit of sour and tart character, sweet, vinous. The aromas there are nice, but a bit subdued. I like my quads a bit bigger in the aroma department. Good, but could be better for me.
T: Again, sweet, fruity and boozy up front. Very hot. Finish is a tad bitter but mostly a drying alcohol character. Malt is felt through out. Huge taste. Almost a champagne character to it. A bit overwhelming at first, but very nice.
M/D: Full body, but not very heavy. Carbonation is too high for my taste, too prickly and contributes to a bit of falling apart on the tongue. Drinkability is a little low for me, it's just such a big beer. Despite the huge booze presence, I can still appreciate this beer. The sample I had while in Belgium was much less bold then this sample. 934 charactersNCSUdo, May 26, 2009
4.49/5  rDev +0.4%look: 5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Got this at the bottle shop down the road. 
From a bottle into a Rochefort Chalice. 
Note: Part of the Quad Showdown, including the Rochefort 10, St. Bernardus 12, and Westvleteren 12, in that order. 
APPEARANCE: A cautious pour yields a thicker, fluffy looking tan head that fits the top of the glass perfectly. Colour is a nice opaque seal brown with some carbonation evident, which quickly dies off. Head has good retention and eventually fades to a decently thick film. Film remains until the end and leaves some nice lacing down the glass. The look of this beer is fantastic, and it looks like a piece of art in the beautifully crafted Rochefort glass. I'd almost rather take a picture of it instead. 
SMELL: Mainly dark fruits, raisins mostly, with some grapes and dates as well. Spices in there too, such as cloves and coriander, along with some spicy alcohol. A touch of Belgian yeast underlines everything. Very nice, though I wish it were a little bolder. 
TASTE: This is definitely bolder. Lots of dark fruits again, raisins, grapes and dates, alongside some spicy elements, much like the nose advertises. Spicy alcohol brings up the rear, which gives the whole a slight wine-like quality. A strong and long lasting aftertaste is full of spices, clove and coriander again, with some alcohol there as well. Not overly sweet or bitter, and the alcohol, though present, is well balanced and not overpowering. Delicious to say the least. 
PALATE: Medium body and medium carbonation. Nice and creamy on the palate, goes down creamy smooth with a bit of an alcohol scratch at the end and finishes with the right amount of stickiness. Solid here as well. 
OVERALL: This one definitely lives up to the hype, and then some. It puts its little brothers, the Roch 6 and Roch 8, to shame. As part of the Quad Showdown, this was my favourite of the three by far. A thing of beauty in the glass and a real tasty treat, the Rochefort 10 is a real pleasure. Probably the most drinkable quad as well. Though one at a time is enough, this one will become a staple in the beer cellar. 2,083 charactersJeffo, May 25, 2009
4.03/5  rDev -9.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured from a 11.2 oz bottle into a tulip.
Appearance: Quite a strong, dignified pour. A strong brown sugar brown with just a hint of translucence around the edges of the glass. The head does not form right away, but after a patient and proper pour, a healthy foam arrives. Gentle lace clings to the glass.
Smell: Strong malt and yeast character, somewhat caramelly but more vanilla and spice flavors. The alcohol can be subtly noted.
Taste: An extremely complex malt flavor greets the palette. Each sip, particularly with changes in temperature, reveal something new. Figs, vanilla, and caramel are the most obvious flavors, but I have gotten hints of nutmeg and raisins. The alcohol is well-hidden, but I get a little in the middle of the sip. I am left with a slightly tart and dry finish. 
Mouthfeel: A smooth, balanced feel. Creamy and carbonated at once, and it has a little bit of an oily texture.
Drinkability: Considering the alcohol content, definitely a little bit too drinkable. I did not even think about it being 11.3% until I had breezed my way through my first.
Overall a great beer. Tough to go wrong with a Trappist though. 1,147 charactersKickInTheChalice, May 24, 2009
3.87/5  rDev -13.4%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5A- Quite dark with brown undertones. Pours with a solid .25" head that doesn't go away. A healthy amount of lacing sticks to the glass.
S- Different hints of berry, grapes, caramel vanilla and malt.
T- Complex with a definite alcohol presence. Starts sweet and robust with bits of caramel and molasses. Slowly finishes with a tinny flavor. A dark bitterness resides on the tip of the tongue. After the beer warms the taste becomes more complex and the nuances of the beer come out.
M- A hardy dose of tingling carbonation throughout, finishing dry. A little dry for my tastes.
D- The carbonation makes this a little hard to drink fast, but this is a sipping beer anyway. Still fairly easy to drink the despite the high abv.
I've had this many times in the past and enjoyed it much more than today. I will have to re-evaluate this world class beer in the future and see if I rate it higher. 894 charactersSpacegrass, May 23, 2009

I love me some unfiltered beer. It looks like someone sawed a 2x4 right over my beer, thank you carpenter.
smells like: malty raisins with other dark fruits with alcohol definitely in the background
tastes like: wow, so creamy. the creaminess shield some spice that tries to get through from the yeast. Im too distracted by the creamy smoothness to really detect anything more, yet the alcohol is very present.
feels like: delightful slightly thawed frozen cream puffs, mmmm.
drinks like: goes down very smooth but sits at the very top of the stomach almost center chest where it lingers to burn a warming hole. Definitely an amazing beer suited for the winter seasons.
this is by far a favourite, more so than the famed St. Bernie 12 that is so beloved to my heart and to so many others as well. A polite bow to the devoted Monks at Abbaye St. Remy. 1,065 charactersJtschupp04, May 21, 2009

Taste is amazing strong, a touch bitter, but full of flavor. Maybe even some fruity notes.

4.6/5  rDev +2.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4A cautious pour creates a medium brownish head with very good retention. Body is a very dense extremely dark brown. Carbonation is fairly high, lacing is average but still have to give high marks overall. Good looking beer.
Aroma brings on wave after wave of dark fruit including plums, raisins, dates and figs. Also a fair amount of spice, alcohol, and hints of yeast.
On the palate the malty fruit complexity is met with even more spice than the nose. While it's obvious alcohol sweetness is going to make an appearance in a beer this strong I can't think of any other ale of similar ABV that comes across less boozy. In a sure mark of a great Trappist Quad the complexity masks it quite well. 
Mouthfeel is incredibly delicate with the carbonation at just the right level for the style. Drinkability is as high as any 11.3 ABV beer can be.
Overall a world class beer. Been a long time since I've had sister beer Westvleteren 12 but from memory this stacks up quite well against it. I have a few bottles of Westy in the fridge and will review soon. I'm curious to compare the reviews. 1,090 charactersberkey, May 18, 2009

S: full complex smell of pleasant yeast, toffee, roasted grains and coffee, cream and chocolate, dried fruits, slight alcohol.

4.07/5  rDev -8.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.5Chilled bottle poured into a Rochefort branded chalice glass.
Appearance is a dark brown with red hues that almost moves it to a rust coloring. Thick head with good retention and lacing that sicks like sap.
Nose is brilliantly complex with deep malts, roasted dark fruits and nuts along with sweet notes that relate to brown sugar, coffee crystals and sticky date.
The taste sensation hits the plate with force. It's a complex mixture that holds malt as its focal point. Sweet malt sits comfortably alongside dry roasted malt which both ride a top of carbonated alcohol twang. Once again the unexpected sticky date pudding flavor pops up along with dark fruits and peppered spices.
Rochefort 10 grips the taste buds and and holds it as waves of flavor come forward until the continually persistent alcohol stands alone at the finish.
One great trappist quad howver only slight bettered by the Rochefort 8 which I consider to be slightly more rewarding, however only just and this is just my opinion 1,003 charactersSleepyMonk, May 16, 2009

S- Yeasty, some sweet malt notes, caramel, solvent, slightly vinous.
T- Whoa. Rich, rich malt. Slight alcohol, subtle spice. A real depth of flavor in the malt. Biscuity, bready, sweet (fruity--raisin?), slightly roasty. They're all there.
M- Velvety. Medium bodied. Soft and good.
D- Pretty high for the ABV. This is a good brew, definitely a great sipper.
Still not 100% sure which I like better--the 8 or the 10--I think the mouthfeel here puts the 10 over the top, although I think I like the style of the 8 better. 652 charactersLordAdmNelson, May 15, 2009

A: The body has a stained-wood opaque color. The one inch head stays with the beer, it's amazing. It's been 10 minutes and it's still there, without any fading.
S: Smells malty, slightly hoppy, and fruity. It's all faint, no smell is overwhelming.
T: The ale is moderately fruity. The malts are mixed in well enough so it doesn't give off any offensive taste. It's perfect really.
M: Smoothe, intriguing, and perplexing. These monks are good.
D: Considering this Belgian ale is 11.3% ABV, I would probably not venture into having a second, then again, I respect this beer too much to have more than one per sitting. It is a great Trappist brew and would recommend it to any beer connossieur. 741 charactersMLasoski, May 13, 2009
3.92/5  rDev -12.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 333cl bottle from Systembolaget, old school Lund status. Ok, here we go then. Very dark brown with a small tan head that leaves lacing til the end. the aroma itself is intoxicating: sweetness, vanilla, hazelnut, caramel, some butterscotch, and a little alcohol. The flavor is very sweet and alcoholic; a bit straight-forward in this respect, a lot of caramelized sugar flavor and ripe fruitiness. The body is very thick and full, but the alcohol keeps it from being too sticky in your tongue, and the coarbonation is ample but very soft at the same time. This is quite a beer, but I still like Rochefort 8 more, simply because its levels of alcohol and thickness make it a more pleasant experience. 10 is simply a massive beer, you've got to be ready for it for sure or it'll kick your ass. 789 charactersbulletrain76, May 11, 2009

T: Plenty of roasted flavors of coffee and toast. Very good taste of chocolate. Some wood and earth. A quite restrained fruitiness (plums, cherries, black currants). Quite a lot of warming alcohol in the finish. Some spices, hints of oak and vinous fruits rounds everything up. A very rich and sophisticated taste overall.

4.52/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured from the bottle into a tulip and I don't know if I've ever seen more sediment float through in my life. Not that that's a bad thing, but I admit that I had to work up my courage a little bit to get it down (even though I've read you're not supposed to drink it, I figured for the price, I wanted every drop out of the bottle). Drank and reviewed on 5/6/09.
Appearance: Pours a murky dark coffee brown with a slight hint of amber; huge fluffy off-white head of 3 figners that becomes pock marked and cratered as it dwindles slowly down; appears to be littered with sediment; head has very nice retention.
Smell: Strong smell of sweet malts, candied fruits, specifically prune; sweet and spicey (corriander and nutmeg - the standards, but these smell much more natural and "real"); slight scent of alcohol.
Taste: Strong presence of the candied fruits and a very sweet burnt sugar presence from the malts; spices are definitely there but slightly muted in the mouth - a little bit of a surprise considering how strong I thought they were in the nose; presence of alcohol comes through on the breath and palate from the vapor.
Mouthfeel: Very lively and tingly from a very solid carbonation and high ABV; finishes dry, very dry; mouth, throat, and chest are very warm from the alcohol.
Drinkability: This one kind of kicked my butt, but it was well worth and if I had a second bottle of it, it would have likely been drank in the same sitting. ABV is pretty big, so it's probably better in moderation, but this is easily one of the best balanced and tasty beers I've come across yet. 1,592 charactersbamadog, May 09, 2009
4.4/5  rDev -1.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 411.2 ounce bottle poured into a Chimay chalice. Best before 23-01-13. Comes in at 11.3%.
A-When cracked, it produces a beautiful hiss from the pent up carbonation. The color can best be described as dark brown chocolate. Has a 3/4 finger off white head that sticks around. Lots of bubbles rise up the side of the glass and there is a ton of suspended yeast sediment floating in the glass.
S-Smells big, just like a quad should. When I first crack it open, it smells like a more potent form of grape juice than the 8. Lots of stone fruit in here, but with the 10 the fruits have been doused in rum. There is also sweet caramel malt and brown sugar.
T-The sweet caramel malt hits fast. The rum soaked stone fruit, particularly raisin and plums, come next. The alcohol is noticeable, although not a distraction, and leaves its marks going down and also out of my nose. There is also a spicy kick left after each sip.
M-Big, creamy, and perfectly carbonated.
D-The high abv hinders the drinkability of this one. Great as a nightcap.
Another classic from Rochefort. A very complex beer that mandates sipping slowly. 1,116 charactersmjl21, May 07, 2009
4.45/5  rDev -0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5I wasn't a huge fan of either the Rochefort 6 or 8, so here goes with the 10. Best before July 16 2013.
Big hiss of carbonation upon popping the cap. Pours a dark caramel brown color with a big, dense and slightly fizzy tan head. I notice a lot of floaties in it and some yeast sediment lingering on top of the head. Head settles slowly, keeping a very full lace and some splashes of stick on the sides.
Smell has rich aromas of dark fruit and caramelized malt. I get plums, raisins, loads of caramel, maybe some cherries. Has a rum-like boozy scent to it, like rumcake perhaps given the sweetness. As it warms I get some berries, grapes and pepper, as well.
Taste is also a bold and rich combination of sweet malt and dark fruits. Lots of caramel, plus some brown sugar and sweet rumcake. Plums, raisins, dates, cherries. Estery yeast has a black pepper bite to it, as well, moreso than was evident in the nose. There are layers of fruit here; I'm getting some berries, too. The finish has a bit of earthy and smoky bitterness along with a good dose of lingering black pepper. The pepper builds as I get deep into the glass, and I notice some clove as well. This is really quite spicy, surprisingly so, although the depth of malt flavor stands up to it.
Mouthfeel is a slightly chewy full body but has maybe a bit more carbonation than I'd like it to, with a slight spritzy quality. It has a dryness in the finish owing to the spice.
I like this far more than either the 6 or 8. Very complex, rich and tasty. The bold spiciness surprised me, but the rich malts and dark fruits balanced it out nicely. Great stuff. 1,619 charactersnumber1bum, May 06, 2009
4.37/5  rDev -2.2%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Pours a dark ruby brown body, but not dark enough to cover up all the big chunks of yeast floating around, and a big chunky head of white foam.
Smells like brown sugar and dark fruits. Plums, raisens, figs maybe. A hint of cocoa, and maybe something floral? Gives a very nice aroma none the less.
A very sweet and malty beer, dark fruit's very strong on the palate, a little cocoa or light chocolate as well. 
Very creamy body that leaves a nice after taste, goes down smoothly and heats you right up. 
Overall a great belgium quad, one i'll deffinatly be getting more of. 576 charactersStockfan42, May 05, 2009
4.53/5  rDev +1.3%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Okay, this is my 50th beer review by golly Benjamin Franklin Big Boy Baby! :)
330 ml pour into chalice. Moderate, yeasty off-white head. Very deep, dark brown pour. Definite aroma of dark caramel, ripe banana peel. Malt, caramel and alcohol on the nose. Wow! the alcohol hits you at the very end of the sip. Smooth beer, very flavorful. Drinking this around 60 degrees. I think I'm having a religious experience here. The flavor of this heavenly brew is simply - OUTSTANDING. All I know is I have come a very long way from the macro brews I consumed 6-8 months ago - CHEERS and God Bless the Trappist Monks! 608 charactersOzarkElmo, May 03, 2009

S: Brown sugar, dark stone fruits and Belgian earthy complexity. The flavors combine in a very appealing fashion.
T: It's a really great beer. There are just a ton of flavors. The best Belgians, like this beer, are just beyond my capabilities to describe. It's a wonderful beer and I'll leave it at that.
M: Lushly creamy and smooth.
D: It warms you as you drink in a marvelous way, a bit like good Scotch. Rochefort really makes a fine quad. 558 characterspopery, May 01, 2009
4.42/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Poured into a snifter as a celebratory drink after a brutal Organic Chem exam. Probably don't deserve to celebrate, but what can you do.
A - Thick and opaque, with tints of ruby and mahogany. Nice toffee-colored, creamy head. I didn't decant, so the yeast tumbled into the glass. It was chunky and black - not too appealing, could be a sign of infection...
S - Dark malts come through nicely, with wafts of sweet raisin. I'm getting a spiciness, too, and it actually reminds me of... I dunno, BlackJack gum. Licorice, I guess. Also, a pleasant prick to the nose comes from a touch of volatile alcohol. Makes my mouth water. Not much sign of an infection.
T, M, D - Powerfully malty - tastes a lot like it smells. Dark, dried fruits shine through that play well with its sweetness, which shines near the end along with an alcohol spiciness. Slick, creamy mouthfeel and surprisingly drinkable, but I think the chunky yeast is a sign of something slightly off, though I don't think I'm learned enough to put my finger on it.
My first Quad! 1,040 charactersofosho, Apr 29, 2009
4.32/5  rDev -3.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4A: Mahogany to dark brown. Very thin, tan head.
S: Very malty/sweet. Some fruits and dark chocolate, like that from a bock.
T: Very complex. A lot going on here. I get a lot of the malty sweetness and just a hint of the fruits. The dark chocolate is apparent as the beers warms up. Alcohol is detectable of course, but blended well.
M: The alcohol blends well with the taste, but boy does it warm you going down. Some mild carbonation as well. It does finish quite smooth though and the hang is minimal.
D: It's a sipper, but well worth the time it takes to knock one back. Take your time and try to figure out all that is going on in this. 640 charactersInfamous7100, Apr 29, 2009

A - Hazy Brown body with a nice tan head. Head has some staying power and leaves some lacing.

T - Warming Alchohol. Bittnerness. Fruity and Woody. 
M - Full Bodied, Creamy, Burns soo good.

A - Color is a lovely dark brown/black, yielding a brown tint in the light. Tan Head is fluffy and retains well, leaves decent lacing.
S - clove, cinnamon, caramel, dried fruit. Great smell, albeit slightly boozy. Malty; little to nothing hop wise
T - Sweet raisins and brown sugar dominate with the roasted malt. Alcohol is present and hinders it's otherwise great flavor.
M - Body is fairly thick and smooth but the carbonation is high. A great balance of weight and fizz.
D - The Boozy smell and taste are what's holding back this one. I can definitely finish it and enjoy drinking it, but it's not an everyday beer. It's an occasional treat; good to share with someone else as well.
Overall - Paired it with some dry wild boar sausage; turning out to be a very good combination.I did enjoy this one, but I must try the other quads out there before I decide on what's my favorite. Give it a try if you've never had it. 984 charactersDannyS, Apr 27, 2009
4.11/5  rDev -8.1%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4I enjoyed this beer from the comfort of my own living room. From the 11.2oz bottle to a tulip glass.
Appearance: The prettiest beer I have poured in quite some time. Pours a beautiful deep reddish brown with a fluffy brown head which stuck around for a while.
Smell: Caramel malt and a hint of alcohol. There is much more going on here, but my nose isn't keen enough to pick it all up.
Taste: Nicely balanced and you can definitely taste the alcohol. Lots of spice and I believe more of the caramel flavor. Same with the nose (to borrow from the Beastie Boys) there is something going and I'll probably never get it.
Mouthfeel: Buttery smooth and medium-bodied.
Drinkability: Very in your face up front but mellows out as it goes along. Not a session beer because of the high alcohol, but would definitely drink again. 823 charactersnsmartell, Apr 26, 2009

4.0 A: Opaque dark brown color. Light brown head with good retention and lots of lacing.
4.5 S: Raisins, plums, dark cherries and a bunch of roasty toasty malts.

4.0 M: Medium body. Fizzy carbonation from Belgian yeast. Somewhat creamy.
4.0 D: This is probably a little over-rated, but good nonetheless. 491 charactersDavoleBomb, Apr 25, 2009
4.67/5  rDev +4.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Poured into a Duvel tulip.
Appearance: Average pour produces a large, loose, fizzy, tan head that quickly dissipates to a creamy crown. Head crackles and pops throughout the session. Body is murky brown with light visibility around the edges. Streams of bubbles climb the walls of my tulip, and the output of the central carbonation column can easily be spotted from above. Impressive lacing for this style of beer.
Smell: Figs, raisins, molasses, and an entire loaf of banana bread. Roasted malts, chocolate, and cola round it out along with some alcohol. All of the flavors meld together nicely; this is really a treat to smell.
Taste: Flavors aren't nearly as distinguishable in the taste as they are in the smell. This is a tough one... I get raisins, cocoa, prunes, Belgian yeast, roasted malt, and a great deal of spiciness. Not sure if that spiciness is a result of the carbonation, the alcohol, or the hops, but it seems to dull a lot of the previously mentioned flavors. That being said, those same flavors seem to pick up strength as the beer warms.
Mouthfeel: Kind of slick yet kind of creamy - what do you call that? I really don't have a word for it. BM me if you do. I'm not a big fan of the high carbonation, but I know that's just part of the style. Finishes dry and spicy and kind of chewy; other flavors fade out quickly.
Drinkability: This is one of the best beers I've ever had. I really wish I had purchased more than one bottle because I could really go for some more right now. Next time, I'm drinking it warm - the flavor profile really picked up right at the end. 1,593 charactersThreeWiseMen, Apr 24, 2009
4.42/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5A-Murky, deep chocolate brown with a thick tan head that reduces slowly to a thin cap and leaves nice lace.
S-Dark cherries, rich, dark malts, plums, spicy yeast and a touch of earthy hops.
T-Rich and intense with notes of dark fruits, sweet caramel, chocolate and brown sugar. A bit of booziness sneaks in to add even more complexity. Earthy spiciness from the yeast and hops finish things out. A most impressive collection of flavours.
M-Medium body and quite crisp but smooth at the same time. A bit of alcohol heat lingers as done plenty of swirling flavours.
D-Second only to Westy 12, and not by much, in my book. A quality and very complex brew that begs to be discovered. The flavours duck and hide and then peek out to offer themselves up for the imbiber. A most impressive offering from the Abbaye St-Remy monks! 826 charactersDeuane, Apr 22, 2009
4.17/5  rDev -6.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4.5An exceptionally good, strong beer at the end of an exceptionally long day. Poured from the bottle into a snifter. Served at cellar temp. 
Pours dark murky brown with a pillowy light brown head that sticks around for a long time. Smells of dark fruits, yeast, dark malts...very belgian, surprise. The taste is excellent, dark fruits, sweet, malty. Lots of warmth coming from the high alcohol content. The body is thinner than I expected it to be, very smooth though. 
Very good, but not mind-blowing like I had hoped it would be. 531 charactersShumista, Apr 22, 2009
4.2/5  rDev -6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4It pours a downright ugly, murky brown. Ugly but par for the course with this style. Puffy tan white head that disappears quickly. It smells like raisins and brown sugar. Sweet but not too sweet. The taste was good. Very complex and deep. Smooth carbonation, slightly creamy. Good stuff.
I really liked this beer. More than I thought I would. It's sweet but not sickenlingly sweet and the alcohol is present but not overpowering. I'd be happy to drink this anytime... But not so happy to pay for it. 500 charactersBrew33, Apr 21, 2009
4.03/5  rDev -9.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured from an 11.2oz bottle into a tulip glass.
A: The beer is a deep brown color, with a large foamy beige head that fades very slowly and leaves a thick lace on the glass.
S: The aroma is of dark malts, dark fruit, Belgian yeast, some spice and a touch of hops.
T: The taste is malty up front with sweet flavors of dark fruits, caramel, brown sugar and chocolate. There's also a little bit of complementary tartness coming from the fruits. There's a good backbone of Belgian yeast. The hops presence is very mild and there's very little trace of the 11.30% ABV.
M: Crisp and very smooth, medium body, medium carbonation, slightly sticky finish.
D: Tasty, goes down dangerously easily, not too filling, very strong kick, very good representation of style, I can appreciate the beer's complexity & craftsmanship and while it's a really good strong Belgian beer to drink for a whole night, I've had other Quads that I would pick first. 940 charactersTheManiacalOne, Apr 21, 2009
4.36/5  rDev -2.5%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4For my 50th review I wanted something special. I knew it was coming up so I prepared in advance. Special thanks to Ktown67 and Amietaj1 both for providing me some bottles of this beer! It is unavailable in Texas anymore. Since St. Bernardus Abt 12 is my favorite beer in the world, this was a shoe in example of a 50th review.
Presentation: Poured from 330ml brown glass bottle into my Duvel tulip. This bottle is dated with an expiration of 12-13-2013. This beer has a shelf life of 5 years so this particular example is about 5 months old, but has been in a 38 degree fridge for a few weeks so maybe it's 3 months old now.
A: Pours a deep rich mahogany color. Small yeasty floaters are sparse but present. The head poured is a perfect 2 finger light tan that rests atop the beer like a thick blanket that never goes away completely. The beer laces the glass perfectly as well. Nothing more I could ask for here. It is also completely translucent, but does allow some light into it.
S: Smells of dried figs and raisins, some clove-like spiciness and alcohol is for sure present. As the beer warms the alcohol is less pronounced, and the dried fruits become more apparent as does a mixture of dark/milk chocolate aromas. This one smells really good.
T: At first I'm completely and utterly disappointed. I mean sure I started out drinking it around 40 degrees and I knew that was way too cold, but alcohol is really dominant. There is some malty sweetness as well, but no complexity whatsoever. Then as the beer warms up, THIS is the gem I was looking for. Wow it's really really good after it has warmed to the proper temperature. Shame on me for expecting it to taste right at 40 degrees. After warming the alcohol is almost invisible now, the raisins, chocolate, and figs are all there, and it is fairly complex as well. The nose has improved alongside the taste, but the taste is incredibly good after warming.
M: Absolutely perfect. Carbonation is spot on, and the weight is just right. It doesn't get better than this.
D: Due to the alcohol warmth when cold I rated this one slighly low. Maybe that's wrong of me to do, but so apparent I have to knock it down a bit.
Overall St. Bernardus Abt 12 remains the king for me. It is more drinkable at any temperature versus the Rochefort. At the same temperature I'm not sure which I would prefer. The Rochefort has more spiciness from clove, and more chocolate, but the St. Bernardus has more dark dried fruit and possibly sweetness as well. In appearance they're basically equals, in mouthfeel the Rochefort may have a slight edge, St. Bernardus wins in drinkability, and smell, and as far as taste I'd need them side-by-side at 50-55 degrees to decide for sure. Either way a SUPERB beer and I will enjoy the other 3 that I have very much.
EDIT: Adding to my review, I had another of these last night on 5/4/09. I let the Rochefort 10 rest tonight at room temp for about 20 minutes before digging into it. The carbonation seemed less today and not in a good way, its mouthfeel was also a little thicker than I'd like. It seemed to be sweet without carbonation and spices to back it up, and had a really unique taste. Not adjusting my numerical scores today, but St. Bernardus Abt 12 is still king for me compared to this one. 3,284 charactersthirdeye11, Apr 20, 2009
4.6/5  rDev +2.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Poured into a snifter from a 11.2oz bottle.
Appearance is damn near perfect. Thick, bubbly light brown head, about two fingers worth, that eventually settles but never goes away, just stays there like a thick blanket over the rest of the beer. Deep dark brown thats only barely penetrated by the light. 
Get some malt, maybe a little spice in the nose. Sweet spice, like clove.Just a slight smell of alcohol. A little bit of dark fruits too.
This is a really delicious beer. Just a little sweet, just a slight alcohol bite. Lots of spice, that clove and some other sweet spices (nutmeg?) are coming through pretty heavy. Little more alcohol as it warms but nothing crazy. I could probably sip on this all night. Some things going on that I don't even think my pallet can properly get a handle on.
Sips very nicely. Not super-heavy but definitely has some heft to it. Doesn't stay on the tongue too long except for that nice little bit of spice.
I would probably drink this all the time if I had the money to buy it. It's definitely a sipper, something to be enjoyed on a cold night after a long days work. Really good. 1,123 characterscitan133, Apr 19, 2009
4.5/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Apearance: Poured out of an 11.2 oz bottle into a goblet. The freshness date on the bottle is 01-10-13, and from what I understand this is five years from the bottled-on date. This beer pours a beautiful chocolate brown color that makes this beer look like a melted Hershey's bar, and this dark, rich looking beer allows no light to pass through even when backlit with a lamp. The large, two fingered head is easily and rapidly formed, and is a pleasant medium khaki color. The torrent of small carbonation bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass helps to keep this head alive, and even in a wide mouth goblet the head retains complete surface coverage. It leaves very little lace behind, however, but this is probably due to the high ABV.
Smell: This is an exceptionally dark and boozy nose, and it has very strong aromas of dark fruit (prunes and raisins) and alcohol, and at first sniff it reminds me more of rum than of beer. Subsequent sniffs help me to pick out some of the less potent aromas, and I can perceive hints of brown sugar, anise, and bittersweet chocolate. 
Taste: As was the case with the nose of this beer the taste has a very intense medicinal alcohol character about it, and I must say that it is one of the most perceptibly high ABV beers I've ever tasted. This creates a strong warming effect on the throat during consumption, and I can see this beer being perfect for a cold, dark, winter night. Besides the alcohol this beer has a very thick and intense maltiness about it, with a lightly sweet character to the malt. There are also hints of rich, dark molasses, dark fruit (raisins and plums), anise, and just enough clove taste to make you realize that this is a Belgian yeast strain. There is also the same rum quality that was present in the nose, and slight hints of smokiness that, when combined with the hearty alcohol taste, remind me a lot of Laphroaig scotch. 
Mouthfeel: This beer is heavenly smooth and creamy, but the body isn't quite as robust as I was expected. It's a little on the low side compared to other Trappist beers, but it still ranks above average. BJCP guidelines state that "authentic Trappist versions tend to be medium-light to medium [body], while Abbey-style beers can be quite full and creamy", so perhaps this was the body to be expected, but I still can't rate this beer a five because I can imagine a fuller-bodied Quadrupel.
Drinkability: Some beers attempt to hide their high ABV, but Rochefort 10 lets you know right from the start that it will be one of the darkest, strongest ales you've ever tasted. Surprisingly this doesn't do much to limit the drinkability, and these delicious 11.2 oz are disappearing quite rapidly.
Notes: This is one very dark, rich, complex, and strong ale. I didn't pair my sample with anything because I didn't want to distract my palate with anything other than the taste of this highly-touted beer, but next time I might drink this alongside a nice cut of beer or a strong cheese. Hopefully I'll get to do this sooner, rather than later, but at $7.50 a bottle it might be a while before I pick up another one of these beers, no matter how delicious it is. Regardless, if this is a beer that you have not tried yet, do yourself a favor and pick up a bottle next time you're at the store; you won't regret it. 3,312 charactersjohnmichael712, Apr 17, 2009
4.35/5  rDev -2.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Served from 11.2 oz bottle into St. Bernardus Chalice
Pours a beautiful deep reddish brown color. Quarter inch of dense, light brown head. Lingers for a while before spreading around and thinning out. Lovely lacing on the sides of the chalice.
Loads and loads of dark fruit and cloves in the nose. Very complex smell as with some of the other good Quads. Everything seems so well blended that aside from a couple of big hitters, it is hard to put your finger on exactly what it is you are smelling -- no complaints though.. it's nice.
Very well blended and smooth taste. Not my favorite quad (still not a huge fan of the cloves for some reason), but I can see why it gets all the hype. Very different from St. Bernardus in my opinion, which is a little less in your face, perhaps at the expense of some of the complexity (although that one is in my top 3).
Smooth mouth feel -- a little boozy, but considering the ABV, its very well hidden. No problem drinking one, but putting two back would be a bit of a struggle. Definitely recommend it, but if you know you don't like cloves, you may want to think twice about forking over the cash. 1,141 charactersBcaulin, Apr 17, 2009
5/5  rDev +11.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This beer is a nice dark maroon color with a great head not sure the inches b/c the smell kept my nose in it for awhile. It was served at a perfect 50 degrees. As fair as smell there is no Trappiste ale ive had (have had most all of this type) with such a great smell cant even describe it just such a wonderful smell. Taste even better than the smell or just as good. To me Trappiste ales are hard to describe taste/smell wise all i can say is "most" are very smooth with a high abv. you can even taste (especially this one). Mouthfeel not think at all very smooth overall. Way too easy to drink considering the abv. in this beer. 631 charactersa061183, Apr 13, 2009

 poured into a red wine glass, not the proper width of glass, but oh well. i went outside to view it in the light of the setting sun. it looks dark red and brown, bubbles everywhere.
it smells like...i don't know, a casked wine, maybe, definitely a good powerful explosion of scent.
the taste...i can't believe how good this beer is. i don't even know if i can comprehend what this beer tastes like, some dark fruit, my friend said prunes...maybe grapes?
the mouthfeel is great, the longer i keep it in my mouth, the more the flavour evolves.
drinkablility is pretty easy, for the bottle at least. i couldn't drink more than one of these...maybe two, but i'm already feeling kinda drunk.
this is one of the best beers i will ever have in my life 823 characterssluhdrum07, Apr 12, 2009

4.78/5  rDev +6.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5First experience with this beauty.
A - Poured into Duvel glass. Holy smokes, the head is insane. This is the most careful pour I've ever done in my life and the head threatens to spill out the top of the glass. Finally under control now. The beer itself is a dark ruby with a slight soil brown as well. The head is very white. This is the first time I've seen the head of a beer act like a living organism. It's fading in different regions, disappating at its own pace. There are mountains and valleys all in this now, leaving spider webs all acros the glass.
S - Wow... where to begin? First thing that I get off of this is some strong sweetness. Some prune, little bit of tobacco, very bready. Like strong rye/whole grain bread. There are some other general fruity flavors that I can't place right now. Slight estery alcohol as well, but fits in nicely.
T - Again, I am astounded. Extremely complex flavor here, my mind is going crazy trying to pinpoint all of the flavors. All right, there's definite malt breadiness turned sweet, some very nice fruit also in the form of fig, prune, slight banana and strawberry, light tobacco aftertaste, bit of botterscotch, warm alcohol, nice tannins, slight hop bittnerness. Each flavor just rolls into the next, layers upon layers of depth here.
M - This feels better on my tongue than anything else. Very soft, velvety, creamy, leaves mouth begging for more but also somewhat satisfied. This is what liquid bread is all about.
D - This was very easy to put back, very smooth, but if you put many of these down, it would put you down.
In short, this lives up to the hype. Best trappist I've ever had, period. 1,651 charactersyoungblood, Apr 10, 2009
4.74/5  rDev +6%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4My last review was DFH 90 minute. This #10 for my 100th review seemed fitting. On April 10th, which is the 100th day of the year. I'm all about seizing opportunity. Thanks to superfantastic for the idea. 
This is the first Quad that I have had the opportunity to try. I've enjoyed Rochefort's other offerings, and I am sure that this will be no different. 
The first thing that I am struck by is how eagerly the ivory head developed in my snifter. (I wanted to enjoy the big nose that I am expecting). It's retaining and lacing very nicely as well. To say that the head is developing its own landscape is an understatement. Rugged mounds of froth are basically doing what they please in a tectonic display of power. There are little nuggets of yeast floating around, despite my careful pour. That's a little bit of a turn off, but no major problem. 
Nose is dominated by sweetness. There are only subtle hop qualities. As it warms up I am getting butterscotch, and other toffy like aromas. Much more pronounced than I am used to. There's definitely a fresh baked rye bread aroma, almost salty. Very very interesting. 
As for the taste, the hops are on the light side, yet present. I also get the flavor of prunes and phenols. spicy, peppery, and the taste of buttered dark multigrain bread. You know, the kind with rolled oats on top? There are fruity qualities. There's a very hearty food-like quality to this beer. It's incredible. I've never experienced anything like it. Warming in the mouth, the throat, stomach...
The feel of this beer is sublime. It's like what angels would feel like if, somehow, you could drink them. Full bodied, this is one of the softest beers I have ever had in my mouth. 
The drinkability is going to score a little lower, because this beer is REALLY intense. Drinkability over the period of a week or a year? Incredible. Drinkability over the period of a single night? Um....less.
Notes: 
My experience with Beeradvocate.com is literally shaping who I am as a human being. I can't wait for the next 100, and I can't think of a better beer to celebrate my centennial. #10 is one of those that I have always wondered about, and now will always think of longingly. What an excellent beer. Thank God for the Catholic church, and for putting men in monasteries for so long that they literally had no choice but to create some of the finest beers on the planet to pass the time. 2,411 charactersBeernoisseur, Apr 10, 2009
4.7/5  rDev +5.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.51st Review. Poured from a 330mL bottle into a snifter. 
Very dark amber in color and the head was tan with nice retention. A nice lace is left on the glass
The aroma was a deep fulfilling one of dark chocolate, and nutty with a apricot sweetness.
The taste was full bodied with a nice balance of bitterness you wish to find in a dark beer. Toasted and chocolate with a nice maltiness. it has a nice, intense, sweet aftertaste that doesn't linger longer than you want it to. The bitterness fades out and your left with all the beauty of the undertones. 
Smooth and creamy with a nice balanced level of carbonation.
This is a beautiful beer that should be savored. Nicely comparable to the Pannepot Grand Reserva but with a richer history and nicer aftertaste. 763 charactersBiologySean, Apr 10, 2009
4.3/5  rDev -3.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Review #2. Poured into St. Bernardus trappist glass.
A: Nice thin light khaki head. Light lacing. Deep dark amberish color almost like sap.
S: Faint fruitiness but nothing too strong. Traditional smell of dates/raisins is apparent. 
T: Good taste. Notes of a sweet and ever so slightly bitter brown sugar taste with mixed fruits. Not blowing my socks off but for sure a nice treat.
M: This is a strong performance beer. Holds up great while sitting in my mouth. This is the part that begins to impress me the most. Definitely a burn at first but nothing to shy away from. I actually loved the mouthfeel the most.
D: This is right up there as beers go for drinkability. Truly a treat worth having. Obviously not meant to be a session beer but I can see this working out if you grab a few for the night.
Must say I am impressed. While Westvleteren really is the creme de la creme in the Quad class. One can see why this is the runner up. 941 characterschiguy2420, Apr 10, 2009

Appearance:a dark rich brown with a thin head of froth that sticks around .it`s got alot of yeast floating that gathers at the bottom of the glass.
Smell:dark fruits and malt very pleasing to the snout .the fruit ,figs and raisins ,smoky sweet malt and yeast all working together.
Taste:nothing in this beer is off balance and the flavor is no exception .i thought the alcohol would be too strong,or the fruit and yeast too bitter, but to my (not too)sweet surprise this is a good beverage . 
mouthfeel:what dances on this stage?&#12288;a bitter song of alcohol and a fine selection of yeast and that just performs deeper as the show goes on.
Drinkablility: this brew give a fantastic performance. it just grabs your palate and tells you who is in controll it linger on stage to long prehaps by it knows what it`s doing. 876 charactersgoblet, Apr 08, 2009

Mouthfeel: Heavy yet pretty crisp.
Drinkability: I can drink this stuff for breakfast lunch dinner and dessert, I absolutely love it. Plus there really isn't that much of an alcohol bite to it.
Notes: Beautiful, truely amazing. I'm a huge Belgian fan and this one just ousted St Bernardous out of my number one. I saved this for a special occasion and it did not let me down at all! 714 charactersBigIrishman, Apr 07, 2009

A truly great beer. I was lucky enough to be gifted with two cases of this beer, which I have been slowly drinking over the last year. When this supply runs out I may actually cry into my last beer (and then proceed to go out and buy another stash). 498 charactersjwolfie70, Apr 01, 2009

It had a great scent. Well balanced and mild. The malt and hops blended perfectly. I actually salivated.
It had quite a zing. The alcohol was present but tempered. It was spicy and floral at the same time. The malt was rich and tasty. It was medium bodied in a velvety way.
It is drinkable. I like it a lot. 469 charactersRennpferd, Mar 31, 2009

4.5/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A deep brown pour, initially with a thick creamy tan head but soon it turns into a thin film which leaves a sheet of excellent lacing in it's wake. One of the better looking brews.
A somewhat sweet aroma, with some dark cherry and grape.
Tasted like a very well balanced mixture of the above, along with some licorice. The alcohol was there, but blended in much better than most beers of this strength. Very nice.
Mouthfeel was near perfect, yet just a small notch below the very best. Medium/thick and smooth, and with a nice tingle.
This is certainly one of the best beers of it's style. I really liked how it wasn't too over the top with the dark fruit taste or alcohol. Everything meshed together very well to create a wonderful beer to sip and admire. 760 charactersJBogan, Mar 29, 2009

T- Strong malt flavor. The alcohol is fairly present but not too overpowering. There are some coffee and chocolate flavors that come through a bit along with some tart fruit and yeast tastes. Not much in the hops department although maybe a little hoppy bitterness in the finish.

4.58/5  rDev +2.5%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Seriously, how can you not like a Trappist beer of this caliber...
The Rochefort 10 is one of the strongest quad beers out there, you can't find 11.3% ABV everyday.
It looks terrific, even in its dark bottle, but you realize what a masterpiece this is once you pour it in the special Trappist glass. The color is dark, the foam consistent. You see small dark (colloidal?) particles dancing around. A sign of a great abbey beer.
Smell it... ahh, GOOD SWEET HEAVENS! I'm sure the monks say something like that when they sip to control their limited production line. You can even sense its strong content in alcohol, this IS a dangerous potion afterall!
First sip, second sip... if you like sweet syrupus beers you will love this one. The alcohol is there though, carefully masqueraded behind this dense sweetness. The mouthfeel is great as always due to the viscosity.
By the time you finish it you have drunk the equivalent of half a bottle (750ml) of a Retsina wine. Would you have another one? Thankfully, the Rochefort 10 is much more accessible than its cousin the Westvleteren so you can have another one, albeit the price. 1,132 charactersKensai, Mar 25, 2009
4.62/5  rDev +3.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Lightly chilled and poured into a Duvel glass. Glass of cold water on the side to sip from periodically. Freshness date is 011013 which means it was bottled on the 1st of October in 2008 and is just 6 months old. (Which the monks say on their website is the prime age for drinking this beer.)
Appearance: Pours a deep dark brown (almost black) color with a 1" off white head that recedes fairly quickly to leave a rim of foam, a thin surface cover and strands of lacing on the glass. 
Smell: Rich and smooth with few distinct aromas to that stand out clearly. There is clearly sweetness from the malt, and no detectable alcohol. The aroma reminds me of a fine port with hints of fruit and spices. But what fruit? Possibly a hint of banana but this is so complex there is much more here but it is so well integrated that nothing stands out clearly... All I can think of is a mixed basket of fruits or a rich holiday fruitcake.
Taste: The taste is incredibly complex and built around a firm malt backbone with not even a hint of alcohol. It is complex and fruity but as with the aroma I can't really identify which fruits, except perhaps a touch of ripe pear and no shortage of other fruit flavors. 
Mouthfeel: The mouth feel is full and soft from the light, continuous carbonation. The finish is long and malty with hints of chocolate and a dry ending.
Drinkability: For its ABV this is extremely drinkable (sippable actually), but I doubt I could or would want do more than one a night. But each sip leaves me wanting yet another. I now understand why there is so much praise for this beer. This just too complex and well integrated to be broken easily into identifiable elements.
Note: I'll be trying this beer again in a few weeks and will try to improve on this description. 1,783 charactersdrtth, Mar 22, 2009

4.35/5  rDev -2.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4In a snifter:
Pours deep brown with garnet notes. Tons of head; four fingers in my snifter, which is off white, creamy and billowy. Settles very slowly. Alcohol is obvious in the nose. Notes of raisin and dark fruit, a touch of toffee and citrus. Tastes pleasantly tart maltiness flush with plum and raisin. Finishes
with a significant and complex fruity bitter. The aftertaste is
wonderfully sweet and lingers for a substantial amount of time. Strong in body. Carbonation is high, but in line with the style;
fine, and brings out flavor quite well. Rochefort 10's drinkability is somewhat diminished by its high carbonation. Other than that, this is a brew I'd gladly enjoy a couple bottles of.
Overall: It's so nice to have such a great beer available all the time. If you haven't tried this one yet, do so. 811 charactersschroederm, Mar 21, 2009
4.72/5  rDev +5.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Nebbiolo grape and black cherry; Rochefort 10 appears considerably more dark and foggy since I chose to include the sediment. There was enough carbonation that I could see and hear bubbles crackling and yet when all had finally settled, there still rest a creamy, full finger's worth of head! Assuredly, it is capable of enduring well beyond the liquid that lay beneath it. 
There may be no better smell to ever grace this Earth; certainly not my nasal passage anyhow. It is a calming, mellowed perfume of candy apple, juicy wine grapes, spiced holiday bread, exotic teas, and a full garden of fragrant, blossoming flowers. This bouquet takes words like "ambrosial", "luscious", "blissful" and completely diminishes their worth. From now on 'Rochefort' should be the new adjective in describing things celestial and deific. 
The real mystique about Belgian beers like this one is the cultured, time-tested, antique generation yeast that has adapted itself to the brewery and to the beer through generations of evolution. This certainly tastes like the monks must have a secret concoction of far-away spices but they don't. The only trick up their sleeve is the magic of yeast!
Ginger glazed squash, plum pudding, coriander spiced pink fish, sticky toffee pudding, vintage Italian reds, cinnamon tortes, Madeira port, peanut brittle, lavender tea... the list can go on and on and on. It doesn't define flavour - it suggests it. It permits the imagination to take liberties and the palate to pair it with its meal. Given the entwined history of monasteries and brewing, surely we can believe beer like this is a gift from the heavens! 
I didn't fully appreciate Belgian Quads when I first encountered them. (Granted, I thought I could, even despite not really liking the way they tasted). But over the years I've come to recognize their subtleties, acknowledge their distinctiveness, be cognizant of their disposition and have developed a better understanding of just how they not only symbolize, but quite literally are, the result of generation upon generation of skilled and devoted monks. Wow. 2,099 charactersbiegaman, Mar 19, 2009

Poured in a 0.4 L Steiner Pils snifter. Medium sized fluffy tan head. Fairly well carbonated. Cloudy dark brown color, almost opaque. Aroma is floral, sweet, hazelnuts and chocolate, ethanol, like a Ferrero Rocher candy and sweet cherries. Flavor is similar, chocolate and sweet dried fruits, toasted hazelnuts. Tastes of rum and bourbon, warming. Chocolate is lingering in the aftertaste. Heavy milky smooth body, slight tingle on the tongue. Alcohol is warming in the throat.

Poured into a tulip glass a dark brown cloudy fluid with a full foamy light tan head that literally climbs the glass. The head is actually creating a discernable bowl shape at the top of the glass. The fluid neither reflects nor conducts light. 
The smell is rather present with notes of raisins, figs, and caramel with hints of black licorice and other dried fruits. There is also a slight spicy note in the smell as well, a brightness reminiscent of star anise. 
The taste is big, dark, and malty up front with the majority of the dark fruit flavor coming through. The flavor then morphs through a maply sweetness to a dry, somewhat champagne like finish. The aftertaste has notes of dark caramel, coffee, and a touch of burning alcohol masked by the lingering carbonation.
The mouthfeel is complex with fairly high carbonation blended with a full body.
Drinkability is good, but not great. The level of carbonation and alcohol in the finish might turn a few people off. 1,081 charactersahalloin, Mar 15, 2009
4.57/5  rDev +2.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5A: Dark brown, mahogany color. Almost milk chocolatey in shade, but not quite opaque enough to describe it that way. Still, a significant haziness prohibits light from filtering through anywhere but the edges of the glass. Very mild head. 
S: When served at about 45 degrees, scent was alcohol followed by yeast followed by toasted chocolate malts. Caramel and molasses came out next along with some candied ginger. Very complex and rewarding scent. 
T: Sugar, chocolate and fruit malts all rush to the tip of the tongue and swirl around while being quickly escorted down by a strong alcohol burn. At cellar temperature, there is some bitterness on the sides of the tongue toward mid-taste. Even sweeter, smoother and more rewarding as it warms. 
M: Shockingly carbonated initial mouthfeel (gave my tongue a brief jolt), especially given the near total lack of head when poured gently. Otherwise, a thinner body than expected, but overall still pleasant. 
D: Starts out moderately drinkable, but ends as one of the more drinkable beers on the market. 1,054 charactersjnn4v, Mar 14, 2009

Smell - The smell is great, figs, caramel, other fruit and alcohol is evident. Really dark smell.
Taste - It is amazing, soo smooth. Fruits and figs apparent, pear is the main fruit i taste, starts malty, ends with an alcoholic burn, really really nice. Great for its abv. Really really smooth. I really like the aftertaste.
Mouthfeel - Really smooth and surprisingly light for its color and abv. Just the right amount of tingle on the tongue. Perfect mouthfeel.
Drinkibility - I could drink this until my wallet could not support my drinking of it, a really great beer. For its abv it is splendid.

A: Pours a cloudy brown with a nice large off-white head with perfect retention but almost no lacing. The head covers the body for the entire drink. 
S: Smells fruity(both light and dark) strong yeast and some vanilla hints. 
T: Nice fruit flavors such as; apples, plums, pears, and figs. Some earthiness and spice to it. The obvious Belgian yeast flavor adds to the complexity. Strong malty brown sugar flavor with caramel. Interestingly there's also a bit of a vanilla hint. However the flavor overall is in a way too mellow, although it's complex it's not the best I've had. The alcohol doesn't come out much, impressive for a &gt;11%
Overall: Good quad but I don't feel it lived up to the hype. The mouthfeel is great it's nice and creamy with just the right amount of carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good considering the style and alcohol content. As I said very good quad, but I feel that for the price I'd go with St. Bernardus 12 over this. 995 charactersAdmiralDiaz, Mar 08, 2009

A: Very dark brown, almost black. Could be mistaken for an imperial stout at a distance. Starts with a good head that provides a nice cushion but never threatens to take over the glass. 
S: Heavy notes of plum pudding and spicy yeast.
T: Almost too complex for words. I feel like I can't provide descriptions, only fleeing impressionistic takes. I can detect plums and other dark fruits, chocolate, anise, nuts, alcohol, and a bunch of other stuff I can't quite put my finger on.
M: Creamy, rich, and smooth, like a decadent dessert.
D: Absolutely awe-inspiring. In fact, it's kind of humbling to know that the art of brewing can be taken to such heights. To paraphrase Samuel Johnson, "when a man is tired of Rochefort, he is tired of life." Of course, if you possess enough wealth and leisure time to drink Rochefort to the point of tedium, I'll hardly be shedding any tears on your behalf. 933 charactersBarrelO, Mar 08, 2009
4.7/5  rDev +5.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5I may have to drop my ratings on a few other beers after trying this one. Dark, muddy brown with a huge, fizzy head.
Smooth chocolate aromas with notes of sweet fruits and brown sugar. Taste is noticeably sweet, but not overwhelmingly so. Blueberries, bananas, and other fruit flavors blend nicely with the caramel and cake-like tastes. It's hard to imagine these flavors describing a beer, but it works so well.
By far the smoothest beer I have ever had. Creamy and full bodied. The sweetness would make it difficult to have more than one bottle, but at 11.3% you don't need much more. 588 charactersElGrecoVerde, Mar 07, 2009

T: Very sweet with fruity flavors on the initial sweep. A mild raisin flavor, filled with cream and perhaps a touch of caramel. 
M: Smooth a creamy, eventually revealing slight alcohol warmth, which really hits the back of your throat on the swallow. 
D: Quite good. Even with the additional alcohol feel, I think this is more drinkable than the Rochefort 8. 619 charactersThorpe429, Mar 06, 2009

S: Caramelized sugar, but doesn't smell overly sweet. Big notes of dark, dried fruit: raisins, prunes, etc... Slight notes of cinnamon and clove. Nice malty undernotes
T/M: Excellent. Amazingly well balanced, with all the aromas and smells reduced to an intense mouth-filling experience. Sugary dark dried fruit is prominent. Love the carbonation. It really balances out the intensity of the flavors. Can taste the booze a bit.

A- Rochefort 10 pours a dark murky dark brown to mahogany color. A bunch of sediment was seen going in to the pour but i can't help that. Getting some dark ruby highlights. Bubbles are seen rising which leads to a minimal coating of frothy tan head. Minimal lacing.
S- A very sweet smell from far away, even sweeter up front and center. Dark fruits with dates, figs, raisins. Sweet sugar and i get some honey as well. Spices such as nutmeg. Dark roasted malts and some alcohol with warming.
T- Not as sweet as expcted but still up there. Getting the dark dried fruits up front with raisin flavor coming through. Some red grapes and pear are there and apple as well. Maybe some prunes. The spice character is great with nutmeg and clove. Sweet Belgian candy comes to mind. A nice dose of hops as well but not bitter at all. 
M- First sips the carbonation is present on the mouth with a crispness up front. I can feel and hear it fizzing as it stays put. i just let this quad do it's thing as it sits on the palette. Medium bodied with some alcohol seeping through. Not as thick on the mouth as I'm used to in some quads.
D- Very drinkable while not being overly sweet like some in the style. This is well balanced with a warming quality on the way down. 11.3% is quite high but what the hell i would drink a few, you only live once right! A great quad at a fair price with good availability, what more can you ask for. 1,520 charactersBARFLYB, Mar 03, 2009
4.8/5  rDev +7.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5So I thought it was about time I review this Quad classic. I poured this dark beauty into a big fat oversized wine glass. The color is dark brown with a nice tan creamy frothy head that doesn't dissipate, and big chunks of yeast throughout. The nose is very rich and caramel like with toasty nutty, and earthy undertones. 
The first thing to hit the tongue is the strong carbonation. The flavors and complexity are so simple yet so brilliant. I taste earthy and dusty flavors up front like mold or mushrooms then later; wood, vanilla-oak, and toasty, smokey, raisins, burnt malt flavors. It finishes dry and crisp with a butterscotch sweetness in between. Great drinkability- alcohol is almost unnoticeable and the rich carbonation makes it a pure pleasure and a light drinker for such a strong well defined quad. 813 charactersGraham21, Mar 03, 2009

Smell - Fantastic, deep aroma. Dried fruit, raisins and banana stand out.
Taste - Similar to how it smells, dark fruit and raisins are most prominent though there is a little heat to it at the end.
Mouthfeel - Silky smooth with fine carbonation.
Drinkability - Very drinkable for such a strong beer, though one bottle was plenty. 449 charactersAenema, Mar 02, 2009

S: Alcohol right away, then moves to dark fruit, raisins, plums, ripe banana. Very inviting. I've found this needs to be around 60 degrees to really open up.
T: As with the smell let it warm up to around 60. Man, what a taste. Dark fruit, just like the smell. This beer has many layers that you can slowly dissect while you drink it.
M: Smooth and almost no sign of the 11% alcohol!

Appearance: Dark somewhat cloudy color, lots of sediment in the beer. 2.5 finger head.
Smell: After the initial pour it smelt like it was a skunky beer, but that went away within 30 seconds. Afterwards i smelt roasted malts and fruits. Overall it became a very good smelling beer.
Tastes a lot like the smell, of roasted malt and dried fruits. very good. The alcohol is apparent, but not overwhelming. 
In my mouth it gives me a warm feeling. Low carbonation, but not too low... almost a perfect balance. taste lingers in my mouth, which i dont mind at all!
very drinkable beer, I don't find the alcohol too overwhelming by any means. kind of expensive for 11.2 ounces, but that is expected i guess for a beer of this prestige. 822 charactersThePeskyDingo, Mar 01, 2009

Poured into New Belgium Globe Glass.
Color is a dark dark burnt copper. 3.5 finger dark tan. Leaves some lace ring.
This is weird, but it started out smelly very skunky, but then it went away. I was quite shocked. Smell is very complex. Raisins, dark dried fruits. Banana notes. Slight earthy hopes.
Awesome!
Taste is very complex as well. Alcohol is noted as it is 11.3% abv. Very fruity. Some zests. Banana. Raisin is deep. Pretty tasty stuff.
Mouthfeel is creamy, a little bitter, smooth. Leaves a pretty clean aftertaste. Well carbonated.
Overall, this being number 12 overall, I was a little disappointed. It is an amazing beer, but I have had better. I really enjoyed the smell. The alcohol was a little overwhelmng. I do recommend though! 823 charactersmothman, Mar 01, 2009
4.6/5  rDev +2.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.511.2oz bottle poured into a Rochefort goblet (or chalice). The best by date is 100913, so September 10, 2013.
A - very dark brown, nearly black color. When held to the light, the bottom most portion of the bowl (at the stem) is slightly ruby, but other than that, it's dark stuff. A slight 0.5cm head formed on the pour, but it dissipated very quickly into a halo of carbonation around the meniscus of the beer. So far the beer seems to look just like Pepsi or Coke.
S - As soon as the beer was opened, I'm hit with a pungent alcohol smell and a slight metallic aroma. Closer nasal examination reveals cherries, apples, raisins, bananas, caramel, and very sweet malt. As the beer warms, the metal aroma fades. I can longer smell it
T - The taste begins with chocolate, banana and raisin which leads into vanilla, toffee, with a finish of some of the same fruity esters the nose suggested and a vanilla and alcohol finish. The finish is very reminiscent of bourbon, albeit nowhere near as strong and waaay more smooth. As the beer warms, there's a slight dryness to the finish, almost hoppy, with hints of dark chocolate, Dr. Pepper (strange, but it's probably the cherries) and a slightly medicinal aftertaste. Banana begins to come through in the end as well. Wow! This is a really, really complex beer. There's also a touch of molasses in the finish that provides an acrid flavor.
M - perfectly carbonated.
D - this beer is definitely a sipper, but I could sip this all day long if it wasn't for the price. 1,513 charactersbowersdm, Feb 28, 2009

4.75/5  rDev +6.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Pours very dark with a tan head that dissipates fast, leaving a thin layer of foam and lace on the sides of the glass. It performs like the classic Belgian ale it is. 
Smells of dark fruit, prunes, raisins, candy sugar, and a bit of ginger. Very integrated and refined aromas, like an excellent Christmas pudding or cake. 
Very well balanced tastes of sweetness balanced by hops, with prominent raisins, prunes, and ginger. Pardon me, but some Coca-cola flavors are there especially with a little metalic vibe, at first sip, but they are taken to a higher level with a huge coffee/tofee and hop ride, then turning to a lovely numbing ginger aftertaste. The alcohol is noticeable, dark rum-like in taste. This beer gives the entire palate a roller coaster ride. 
Very full and creamy mouthfeel. Sweetness and dark fruits at first, resolving into a hoppy, gingery aftertaste that I quite enjoy.
This is a huge, delectable beer, and I could make a habit out of drinking this, except the price and the alcohol limits my consumption. But if your goal were to be driven insane and poor by beer consumption, I'd choose this as the way to go. A Rochefort 8 would also do, but the 10 will get you there quicker. 1,206 charactersBeerenauslese, Feb 27, 2009

S- Lots of deep fruit aromas, plum, raisins and dark cherries. Some caramel, toffee and hint of chocolate are also present in the aroma. I light earthy yeast note and a touch of alcohol. 
T- Very complex fruity flavors, some plum, raisin, and pear present. Also some good caramel, brown sugar and almond notes, with a nice herbal spice present throughout the taste. Some light bitterness and alcohol in the end. 
M- This is a full bodied beer that sticks to your taste buds. Some alcohol bite but nothing to overwhelming. I little more carbonated then I like but still pretty good.
Overall- This is a complex and magnificent beer, great aroma and flavor. If you are into Quads this is a beer you must try. 840 charactersbr3wmeister, Feb 27, 2009

M- Slight tingle on the center of the tongue from carbonation. Velvet smooth and gentle release of complex flavors, it's so good they don't need to punch you in the face with it.
D- If I paced myself I could drink this all night. The combination of subtle fruits and no ego makes this one a must have on hand 562 charactersbrokenleadedcask, Feb 27, 2009
4.62/5  rDev +3.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A: Deep chestnut with active carbonation. Soapy cream colored head starts out strong, then quickly settles to a 1/4" cap that sticks the whole way down. Leaves patches of lace.
S: On the sweet side. Fruit aromas of raisin and apple can be smelled as the beer exits the bottle. A closer inspection reveals maple, clove, anise and even a touch of bubblegum. A very complex aroma profile to say the least.
T: Very warm right off the bat, but the flavor isn't dominated by alcohol. Instead, the aromas from the nose transition beautifully into the beer's flavor. Sweet/bitter balance is excellent. Some yeatiness is present in the form a mild sourdough flavor.
M: Medium body is rather dry and has the right level of carbonation.

Bottles aged a year or so have been some of the most dynamic quads I have ever had, younger bottles produce an everlasting white head that is like nothing else I've seen. Regardless, the sticky depth of dark fruits and other worldly yeast make this an all time great beer. 341 characterssquaremile, Feb 22, 2009
4/5  rDev -10.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 3.5Let me first say that I like this beer but I must admit that it is and will remain in the shaddow of St. Bernardus Apt 12. This beer has a wonderful mouthfeel and presentation but in the end it is both overly sweet and overly alcoholic for my preference.
Poured into a Brasserie de Abbaye des Rocs glass at around 45 degrees this beer has a beautiful brown to purple color and a lovely head that refuces nicely to a nucleated lacing reminiscient of so many great Belgian ales.
The aromas upfront include but are not limited to wood(unfinished cedar it seems), Spanish Rioja wine, acid (almost like vinegar), and dried apricots. As the beer warms and the first taste is taken more aromas take over leaving the first impressions behind. There is a deep malty grain almost breadlike smell and an aroma that reminds me of fresh fig preserves.
The first taste is extremely sweet and acidic with touches of pepper, and an almost mushroomlike heartiness that cannot be ignored. The dried fruit picks up and the finish is of sweet toasted grain, alcohol, and spicy peppercorns.
The mouthfeel is extremely creamy and amazingly robust. Is this a quad or an IRS you might find yourself wondering. The creaminess passes quickly and you are ready for the next sip - and believe me it should be a sip.
At 11.3% abv and 6-8 bucks for an 11.2 ounce bottle I think we can agree that this beer is not exactly the ideal session beer. Keeping that in mind I think Rochefort did a great job when they came up with this beer (ages ago). For me this beer is a sipper and not one I will necessarily seek out again. 
I have one more bottle in the cellar and I think that will sit for ten years plus just to mellow out the alcohol and give the sugars a chance to degrade a bit. My goodness it's like eating pure sugar cane! 1,803 charactersPerzentRizen, Feb 22, 2009

A: A nice dark opaque dark Belgian brunette. Very thin 1 cm head, not a very aggressive pour. Pleasing, the darker the beer the sweeter the...uhhh I don't know.
S: It's malty and for some reason I always envision raisins and plums with a quad, not too far off. Slight alcohol presence in the nostrils. Also sweet.
T: Oh how sweet it is to meet you? Upfront sweetness, dark and fruity, I can feel my tongue becoming a sponge to the all this alcohol. Mid swallow it's still dark/sweet, more malt and the yeast is apparent. There is a sweet cocoa, and alcohol. This beer has a mild hop/spice that doesn't stay it's welcome, very short-lived.
M: Mouthful is about right, moderate carbonation, medium bodied, though you can't really the carbonation, but it's evident as there is always a good 1 cm cap on the top of the beer.
D: Very good tasting beer, still have the 6/8 sitting in the basement, but chose the goliath of these trappist beers. High ABV would keep me from drinking too many. Great sippin Belgian, way to go monks. 1,213 charactersMPLS, Feb 22, 2009

I'm really getting the acohol through the drink and at first this was a little dissapointing, but then when I think about it, this is 11.3%. With that in mind this is exceptional.
I'm getting lots of wood, vanilla, bourbon. Lots of warmth in the aftertaste. This is a sipper. This is something that can be used to keep warm in these cold Minnesota winters. 459 characterscadenwhitaker, Feb 21, 2009
4.53/5  rDev +1.3%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Beautiful light tan head sits atop black liquid with some reddish tones in the light. Some of the tightest lacing I've ever seen.
Sweet, wonderfully complex aroma of apricot, alcohol, and who knows what else. More intensity would warrant a 5. 
Powerful on the palate. Roasty, fruity (apricot, cherry), chocolatey, rummy, raisiny, and oh so much more. Mild banana esters balanced by rich (but not medicinal) phenolics. Bracing bitterness in the finish.
Alchol is present in a very positive way; this beer wouldn't be the same without it. 
Warming, dry and special. Delicious. 
Highly carbonated. Really opens up on the palate. Incredibly drinkable for the abv and intensity. 
This is one awesome beer, and well worth the $6 price tag. I want more. Every bit as good as the uber-hyped Westvleteren, but very different. 822 charactersjjazz, Feb 19, 2009
4.55/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a bottle into a tulip. It starts with a several inch head that reduces moderately quickly to a nice lacing. It pours a deep brown and is opaque in the middle and brown at the edges when held to the light. Some sediment was present at the bottom and very dark.
The aroma includes a nice mixture of alcohol and apples and fruit, as well as a pleasant malty sweetness, like brown sugar.
The taste is what really struck me the best. It is a unique combination of sweet malts and pear, which is quite good. There is another flavor which to the best of my ability seems like brown sugar. The hops are quite disguised but present.
The mouthfeel is also very good. It is medium body with a very good level of carbonation, which accents the flavor. It does leave a dry sensation on your tongue and a mildly spice taste on the soft palate.
Overall, I am very impressed by this beer. I am not a huge belgian ale fan, but this is very good. I will definitely have this again and likely turn a few of my friends onto it. A very interesting beer. 1,048 charactersSykDoc, Feb 19, 2009

Smell reminds me of someone baking with brown sugar in the Kitchen during the holidays. Also with hints of fruit lingering the background of the aroma.
Taste Reminds me of a Holiday drink with caramelized brown sugar and fruits lingering in the background. The flavor of the beer comes threw in a big way, subtle but very remembered.
Mouth feel - Full body beer for sure with a good amount of carbonation that ensues your mouth to dance.
This beer hides it's alcohol level masterfully and is something that my friends and I are able to continue drinking and relaxing with on a long night. 740 charactersBZero007, Feb 16, 2009

Appearance: Dark cloudy brown, poured an off white head the went away quickly, to a film of bubbles.
Nose: A wine-like booziness is present in the nose. Spice, leather, dark red grapes, yeast, cherries, very yummy nose.
Taste: Taste is pretty similar to the nose. A winey booze is there, along with a red wine fruitness. Almost reminds me of a Shiraz that has some nice chocolate covered cherry flavors. There is some toasty biscuity yeast flavors. Fruity malts and esters. A little spice. Alcohol is very present in the taste, if you have a sore in your mouth, (like me I bit my tongue just before in dinner) you'll feel the booze.
Mouth: The carbonation is pretty harsh here. Though it could be a mix with the level of alcohol. There is a bit of yeast sediment that could be a bit much. Though it does leave the mouth pretty clean.
Drink: The high ABV and sharp carbonation makes this a very slow drink. One 12oz bottle is quite enough. 977 charactersturamarth, Feb 16, 2009

A: An opaque brown with reddish highlights when held to the light. A nice light tan-colored head that pours 1 finger high and recedes slowly into a significant film on the top, leaving some lacing behind. 
S: Sour apples, raisins, figs, and cocoa. A very noticeable alcohol nose that is reminiscent of the aroma of cheap spirits in plastic bottles. 
T: The initial taste is dominated by sour apples, figs, raisins. Chocolate comes in the mid-taste. The finish is all alcohol burn, reminding me of bottom-shelf vodka. Normally, I consider how well-hidden the ABV is to factor into the mouthfeel, but it's so prevalent and strong here that I can't even enjoy the flavors. 
M: Full-bodied with active and energetic carbonation -- too carbonated, even for the style. It seems to attack the mouth instead of blending with the flavor. 
D: A very good flavor, but the alcohol smell and taste are an absolute deal-breaker. There are similarly complex brews that do a better job of masking the burn. I will try the Rochefort 8, but I have no intention of purchasing the 10 again. A very undrinkable brew. 1,130 charactersArbitrator, Feb 15, 2009

Pours a murky, rich dark purplish-brown, with a magnificent, pillowy two-finger khaki head on top. The head reduces to a thick, creamy khaki cap that leaves substantial lacing. Very nice. 
Nose is hard to get a grip on - nutty, bit of cocoa, primarily brown sugar, spicy dark fruit, and doughy yeast. What's there is fantastic.
Taste is full, rich, complex, and yet perfectly in sync with itself, if that makes sense. Notes of cocoa and spiced brown sugar, raisins and dates, doughy, spicy yeast, with a mild earthy bitterness coming out to join the fray right before the finish. Finish is sweet, spicy, yeast with some sweet raisin notes. Fairly short finish, warming, just a bit of alcohol underneath. Subtle but big in flavor, all while being very approachable. 
Mouthfeel is creamy and fluffy, perfectly executed, full mouthfeel without being syrupy.
Almost no hint of the alcohol in this one. Even at 11%, I'd have no problem drinking several bottles of this. Masterful. 1,002 charactersJohnQVegas, Feb 13, 2009

P: Silky brown from the bottle, deep purplish-brown in the glass. 1 fingered light tan head of medium sized bubbles disappeared quickly to a thin halo. Minimal lacing left on the glass.
A: Port alcohol, candied sugar, figs, raisins, and a hint of yeast. Pretty good power to the nose, which gives me a good feeling that I'm going to like this...
T:...And I do! This is everything I thought it would be, plus some. Pretty much follows the nose with port-like alcohol being present throughout, but never overpowering my palate at any time. Delicious flavors of dark candied sugar, caramel, figs, raisins, plums, ripe apple, muted chocolate wafers, and a spicy Belgian yeast are hypnotizing me as we speak. This is a full-flavored powerhouse to behold.
M & D: Full-bodied, rich, and silky smooth with a nice prickly bite on the way down. Drinkability is great, but this alcohol deals a lethal blow! I can't believe that big of a punch was packed into that small of a bottle. Damn!
Notes: Trappistes Rochefort 10 is a great beer. It's a sweet and spicy, rich and complex, well-made Quad that delivers quite the headslap to those who imbibe. Excellent! Highly recommended 1,214 characterssweetbrew82, Feb 12, 2009

T- The taste more or less matches the smell, very fruity you can really taste the figs, raisins maybe a small hint of chocolate. Like the smell you can taste the strong amount of alcohol, but it is still very well balanced.
M- very full-bodied and thick with a refreshing carbonation.
D- This is an excellent beer that is extremely well balanced. It bursts with fruity flavor and washes down with it's strong ABV. If it were any stronger it would be overwhelming, but it is just about perfect in my opinion. Does not dissapoint. 889 charactersKBoudreau66, Feb 09, 2009

Pours a deep cola with an immense head that settle quickly to a nice lace and web.
Aroma is of fruit. Dates and figs and intense aromas of raisins that grab you from across the room. Bread and sugar, this has an intense aroma.
Flavor is of boozey rum and raisins. Bubblegum and pheolic alchohol from the grains. There is way more ABV here than is represented in this taste. There is a unique heaviness to this brew that makes it unforgettable.
Mouthfeel is thick and oily, with a soft carbonation typical of long time bottle conditioned brews.
Awesome , I don't know what else to say.

Drinkability is nice for a sipper. 342 charactersgonzo46and2, Feb 06, 2009
4/5  rDev -10.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4A: Pours a gorgeous deep brown which turns to red when held towards the light. This is capped off with a nice, tall, tan head.
S: Plums, raisins, black cherries, dates... generally dark fruits, with a molasses likes sweetness that has overtones of coffee, spice and rum-soaked fruits (like those in stollen).
T: Dark fruits and dark chocolate. Yeasts are very prominent and kind of unexpected for this style of brew. Somewhat similar in taste to the St. Bernardus Abt 12 except that the alcohol has a lot stronger presence: it persists through the taste and goes straight to the head, resulting in a quick buzz. 
M: Oily and slick; very smooth. 
D: For sipping purposes only. 679 charactersthekanna, Feb 06, 2009
4.53/5  rDev +1.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Rochefort 10 has a very impressive pour. Gorgeous deep dark ruby body, with flowing strands of ample carbonation and a nice thick solid off-white head.
Amazing nose on this one. Fruit esters of raisin, plum, dried cherry, fig and prunes. All held against an aggressive rich malt base that dominates the aroma. Medicinal phenols give a peppery spicy edge.
Taste is actually better than the nose. Deep aggressive dark malts with a succulent and mouth coating booze soaked richness. Lots of rich and vibrant dark fruit notes pop out all over. The balance is wonderful, with a dry maltiness sweeping the palate. Complexity is awesome, and this one finishes as flavorful as it began.
This Quad hits the marks. Not quite as good as Westy 12, but this one is glorified in it's own unique flavor. A bit more dark fruit endowed, and a bit more smooth. This is one very, very fine beer. 879 charactersHoustonTX, Feb 05, 2009
4.39/5  rDev -1.8%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Appearance - A very muddy brown with a decent tan head. Laces very little and sporadically.
Smell - Very sugary smell to it, with some fig notes and a lot of spices (cinnamon, nutmeg, clove)
Taste - Alcohol is present, but subdued by the sugary sweetness thats still present in the taste. The spices serve to accent the alcohol rather than add to it, and they are present through the finish.
Mouthfeel - Somewhat dry, but nicely thick. A lot of carbonation to it, but creamy at the same time.
Drinkability - Easy to get lost in considering its 11%. Still not perfect, but its very smooth and palatable. 606 characterssevopie, Feb 02, 2009
4.15/5  rDev -7.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4A: Poured a dark, muddy, almond brown with milk chocolate highlights. Tightly packed tan two finger head. Classic Belgian lace.
S: Dark, dark fruits--plum, grape, along with licorice and a muddled alcohol presence, anejo rum.
T: Dark fruits, again. Raw alcohol infused plums, grapes, and apples with the malts producing a bitter chocolate and toasted caramel character. Musty yeast mixing with the ever present alcohol at the end.
M: Full, yet soft and creamy.
D: If you wanted a reminder that beer is, indeed, and alcoholic beverage, this brew will call that to mind. Albeit, it does so with plenty of complex and crafted flavors. However, if you're drinking a quad, you know what you're getting into, should expect, and enjoy it. So, it's expected and enjoyably drinkable, slow sippin'. 792 charactersphantomwyse, Jan 31, 2009
4.59/5  rDev +2.7%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured entire bottle into a Rochefort goblet. Awesome glass. Let this one warm up.. you'll get so much more out of it.
A - Pours solid caramel brown. Small head slow fades to a thin layer. Some thick bubbled uneven lacing on the glass. 
S - Very sweet up front and over all. Sweet dark grapes, brown sugar and hints of caramel and alcohol. Splendid aroma, earns a 5.
T - Dark and sweet grapes are up front.. in comparison are that of a quality grap-wine taste. The middle is a small dash of caremel and slight burn of the 11.3%. Finishes so nicely with a fading sweetness of brown sugar and bready malt notes. 
M - Medium carbonation. Nice even medium coating that leaves the palate semi-dry and sticky.
D - An excellent sipper here. A fine dark grape sweetness makes it an easy drinker, but be careful a well hidden 11.3% lies underneath. 844 charactersYesac, Jan 31, 2009

The aroma is laced with sweet fruit an alcohol. The flavor hints at dates, and alcohol with a finish that lingers. It is a full bodied with a wonderful creamy mouthfeel that you sip over the course of an hour. 335 charactersbonkers, Jan 31, 2009
4.58/5  rDev +2.5%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5I had this sit out of the fridge for a good 45 mins, poured from a 33cl bottle into Westmalle goblet
A - amazing! poured a perfect 33cl with fluffy head into the goblet. head is the color is a light chocolate milk, you know: if you add too much milk or not enough syrup in. the body is solidly opaque, though I can still tell it is a brown and not a black, like a old ale. most beautiful indeed.
S - a nice spicy aroma, with lingering ethanol in the back. some residual sweetness from the malts,presenting me with a dark molasses scent, and a nice fresh bitter green scent from the hops.
T - well, there is no escaping the alcohol in this beer, it is pervasive in all the steps of drinking. right during the swallow there is a great prick of frutiness, much like plumbs, prunes or other very sweet ripe fruits. this seres to effectively dull the harsh effects of the alcohol, and does it quite well. after the finish, before the true aftertaste, has a strong alcohol taste running up through my nose, like taking a shot of warm vodka. the after taste is slightly sweet from the malty sugars, and it leaves my mouth numb.
MF&D - exceptionally smooth, and easy to drink. the feel is perfect. not too thick or thin, just right and allows all the nuances of flavours to come out. the bluntness of the alcohol is the only thing that impedes the drinking process. 1,361 characterserz316, Jan 30, 2009
4.72/5  rDev +5.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Poured from the bottle (11.3 oz) into Chimay chalice, at roughly cellar temperature.
Appearance: Pours a dark mahogany, darker than any Quad I have seen before. Also noteworthy is the almost impenetrable opacity; I did not pour the yeast, so this was surprising. Head is khaki colored with medium-sized bubbles, eventually settling into a cream which did not dissipate throughout the drink, lacing in a homogenous curtain fashion. A good looking beer, like what they drink in medieval cartoons.
Smell: Alcohol, medicinal, caramelized sugars, fresh cut apples, with a touch of vanilla and an slight underlying scent of earth.
Taste: First wave of taste is caramel and sugars, giving way to rum and dark fruits, especially plum. Finishes with a buttery alcohol note which dries the mouth and leaves a final note of french bread on the exhale.
Mouthfeel: Creamy yet very carbonated, with that perfect belgian crispness, then finishing fairly dry for such a sugary beer.
Drinkability: Very inviting, a romantic coupling of mouthfeel and scent, with a seductive alcohol. I would consider this one a sipper, as I felt the glow after half the glass. This hampers drinkability a it, but for the style it is plenty appropriate.
This beer is fantastic. I will happily splurge on this beer many more times, although I do prefer the Trappistes Rochefort 8. 1,350 charactersGarthTaargus, Jan 30, 2009
4.42/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5This beer pours an incredibly dark and cloudy brown with a 1 fingered light tan head and some lacing. The smell is of raisins and molasses. The flavor is big, there is no shortage of malt in this beer, and certainly alot of dark malts, certainly the darkest quad I have ever tried. There are big hints of raisins and plums int he flavor backed with an enormous malt base... also this beer is quite sweet. The mouthfeel is decent with a rather low carbonation level and for an 11.3% abv beer this beer is HIGHLY drinkable :) 523 charactersBiggness, Jan 27, 2009
4.79/5  rDev +7.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured to a dark brown cloudy color with a perfect sized (fit the glass perfectly) medium tan head that has good legs, leaving sheets of lace down the side of the chalice. This is a very good looking brew. The aroma has a warming alcohol smell, rum or brandy? Dark sugar, could be adding to why I feel it has rum like characteristics? Different fruit, apple and/or pear and cherries. What a fantastic and inviting mixture of aromas. The taste is simply fantastic, again going with the rum aspect, I pick up rum cake. Has a wood like flavor that seems to linger for a bit then disappears. The fruit does come out, but not as the apple/pear I noticed when I was first taking a whiff, with fig / date / prune flavors. Medium spice flavors that mix, oh so well. I know that a lot of folks say that they get banana when they drink this one, not for me as I can't pick up that flavor one bit. The feel of this one does not come close to the 11.3% alcohol level as it is very smooth and well hidden behind all of the interlaced flavors, though as this brew warms the alcohol esters do seem to come out a little more but in a way that is a complete complement to this brew. Very easy brew to drink even though it should be a sipper, but it is damn good and goes down quickly. Give this brew a try as it is simply a delight. 1,315 charactersStimack, Jan 26, 2009

A - Beautiful dark quad, looks like raisins and beautiful lacing when first poured, which quickly dissipates.
S - Hard to detect anything too strong, definitely malts, ripe red/purple fruit.
T - Very good Quadrupel - hops are hidden, nice malt introduction with some cinnamon.
M - Good carbonation here, balances the sweetness.
D - A great sipping beer, for a special occasion. 549 charactersraoulduke37, Jan 25, 2009

Smells of dark fruit, burnt sugar, a bit of alcohol. Taste is fruity with a smokey funky taste. Some phenolic and bubblegum in there as well. The carbonation is a bit high. Body is thick, mouthfeel is bubbly/creamy. I loved the smell and taste of this one, but I thought the high carbonation did unfavorable things to the mouthfeel. 450 charactersjohnnnniee, Jan 24, 2009

The complexity of the dried fruit and bready flavors are very nice, but what makes this so special is how perfectly balanced and how nice the mouthfeel is. Probably the most drinkable beer I have ever encountered. A true masterpiece, and certainly among the elite trappist products. 393 characterstconboy, Jan 20, 2009

3.73/5  rDev -16.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Purchased from Siciliano's in Grand Rapids. Drank from a Duvel tulip. 
Look: Dark, dark brown. Light is impenetrable with a low head.
Smell: I can't even pinpoint the smell; it's so damn complicated. 
Taste/mouthfeel: Smooth but leaves alcohol venting from the nose in the aftertaste. Really complex but I couldn't pinpoint any particular tastes. Dark/dry fruit, caramel and brown sugar dominate my taste buds. 
Overall: Not my favorite style of Belgian beer. I think I'll have to keep trying with this style. There's too much going on for my likings. But that being said, the taste gets better the longer it's open and while it's warming up. But, on the final few swigs, the alcohol became too overwhelming and felt dry. 722 charactersItoclown, Jan 19, 2009

pours a rich brown into my tulip. a nice two finger head is produced and fades fast. leaving a decent floating island of foam in the middle. 
smells fruity.some nice malts.
taste is alright, your run of the mill quad. sweetness that leads into a moderate boozy back. 
mouth is fiercely carbonated. aggressive. im not sure im a fan of it. it burns the roof of my mouth when held in. 
an ok beer. im not huge on belgian quads so that might be my issue with this. it might be that im uninspired. but either way not really a huge fan of this. 637 charactersMauerhan, Jan 19, 2009

Poured into a tulip (only stemware I had available at the time).
Being rather new to the ratings break down of a beer - this is one of those beers that just made me glad I'm a beer drinker. I'm not a religous guy but this is one heavenly brew!
The complexity as hundreds of others have noted here on BA is just astounding to me. From the taste of dried fruits to the distinct mouthfeel, this is in my top 10. 
I need to go to Belgium....now. 550 charactersScreamForMe, Jan 17, 2009
4.35/5  rDev -2.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Grabbed a single of this. Hadn't had her in a long time so I decided it's time to get back on that bike!
A- Nice appearance. Minimal head through a light pour. Ruby-brown color. I poured the yeast in (capital sin???) so there is a lot of murkiness in there. 
S- Raisins, cherries, dried cranberries, some yeasty-ness. A little earthiness pops in and out of the nose too. Definatly nothing overpowering. 
T- Wow. I can tell I haven't had this guy in a while! The taste is candied fruits. Again, raisins and dates come to mind. There is some essence of (call me crazy!!) root-beer-ishness. It's nice though. No hops can I detect. I do get some yeasty-ness again, as in the smell. 
Now that it's warmed a bit I'm getting some oak flavors. I forgot how much of a sipper this one is! Slight alcohol at the finish. Let's you know this one will own you. 
M- Very rich. I wouldn't call it creamy, because I feel in a lot of cases those are two different things, but this is rich no doubt. Nice carbonation. 
D- Woah. Drink a few other belgians for a while before having this Holy Grail. Otherwise, enjoy cause this one's heavenly! 1,123 charactersPedro07, Jan 17, 2009

Appearance - dark brown, minimum head with good lacing, good carbonation still after ageing
Smell- spices, dark fruit and a hint of alcohol 
Taste - pretty much exactly how it smells, but the alcohol is not as strong as one might expect from a beer of this strength 
Mouthfeel - light and can feel it on all my taste buds 
Drinkability - like I said before love this beer and I find that two in a single sitting is all you need. It seems only to get better with age. Can't wait to see what another year does. 611 charactersmpg2384, Jan 16, 2009

Aroma of dark fruit, alcohol and spices. Aroma is less sweet than many other beers in the same category even though it is clearly present in this one too. Taste is really nice, dark fruit, alcohol, spices and orange? Mouthfeel is lively, but not as lively as the rochefort 8, this is good, cause I think rochefort 8 isn't very good.

4.85/5  rDev +8.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured from it's gorgeous bottle into a goblet. 
 Upon pouring this brew has a dark mahogany color with a wonderful thick, off-white head. The aroma is at first hard to detect through the head, but eventually hints of rasin, spice, and candied sugar show. The hop aroma is slight, yet still present. All I could say upon tasting was HOLY S**T! This brew has everything a world-class beer is expected to have. Sweet and malty at first, with, fig, rasin, brown sugar, dried fruit, and much more. It finishes sweet as well, but with a very nice, zesty hop touch. This beer is one of, if not, the best I have ever tasted. Even for it's high ABV, it is very smooth and delicate. It's velvety mouthfeel is to die for. It's one of the most quaffable brews I have ever tasted. Rochefort 10 is definitely one to stock up on. 816 charactersWYVYRN527, Jan 08, 2009
4.48/5  rDev +0.2%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5I seem to have the hardest time getting my hands on this beer. The 10's are always sold out, everytime I go to the beer store. To add to that, I have been jonesin' for a good quad and so there was very little doubt in my mind what I would be filling my oversized Duvel tulip with tonight.
This beer looks magnificent. As I finished pouring the beer, the head rose to a four finger beige head with small pieces of grain attached. It dissipitated, leaving behind a great layer to trap all the volatiles from escaping. Great retention, couldn't ask for much better. The color, a majestic dark brown, with no visibilty through the glass, its hard to not get too googly eyed when staring into it, you almost have to remind yourself to drink.
The scent is pretty good. I'm getting a very funky, almost brett like smell that's throwing me off. As it warms, more flavors start showing up, some raisin, brown sugar, red grapes, some banana, and chocolate. I'm getting some citrusy notes as well. Very pleasing and well blended to produce an irresistable aroma.
The taste is nothing short of enjoyable. Its so complex, containing everything mentioned above in addition to some sliver of caramel. Nothing stands out too much, providing a perfection representation of the style. The taste is matched perfectly with the smoothness. I couldn't be happier right now. The citrus, chocolate and ripe banana are what stand out the most to me.
Buy as many of these as you can and drink them fresh or age them for a few years. 1,510 charactersCoolJosh, Jan 08, 2009

T - The first things that hit me were the yeast and the booze, but this was ok with me cause I appreciate beers that like to bring the heat. A few sips later the dark fruit flavors and some of the sweetness began to come out. Yeast was ever present. This beer was an absolutely delicious sipper.
M - Thick, creamy, well carbonated and it only gets better as it warms.
D - As with just about all the belgian beers I have had, the sweetness builds substantially and is the only hindering factor. 645 charactersbifrostguard, Jan 07, 2009

Flavor is all dark fruit, malt, and mild alcohol, the alcohol is actually fairly well masked in this with only a touch of warming.
an exceptional quad (duh!) this was a new bottle, i have enjoyed aged versions even more in the past. My one want from this beer would be a slightly bolder malt flavor, but who am i to complain. 481 charactersSShelly, Jan 05, 2009

S - Dark fruits, raisins, figs, roasted malt, burnt brown sugar, alcohol. 
D - Port, dark fruits, malt, oak. Fantastically blended. Even the California Raisins stand in awe of the raisiny goodness to be found here. The alcohol makes its presence felt in the finish, but does so smoothly.

T: The initial flavor was malty with lots of dark sweet brown sugar, sweet malt, cinnamon and a nice fruitiness from the yeast (dried pears, apples). The beer finishes with a nice creamy fade, spiciness, and warming alcohol notes with a slight residual graininess on the tongue.

4.61/5  rDev +3.1%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours dark brown, with a big fluffy mocha colored head. Consistency of the beer whilst poured is kind of like a big stout, except more bubbly, the head seems more alive. Smells like an amalgamation, sweet malts and belgian sugars, with an earthy grassiness (but no pine like a hoppy IPA or amber), dark fruit and something else, licorice maybe? If these first 2 senses are accurate, then I am in for a treat. 
Upon tasting, I was correct. This beer is amazing. Perfect balance between the main components, malty up front with just the right amount of hop kick to keep it in check to follow. Sweetness is typical Belgian, but far from overpowering, I think the carbonation gives it a sizzle that acts as counterpoint. Hint of a grassy flavor, but nothing like a barnyard. Buried deeper in the flavor profile are dark fruits (plum? raisin? date?) and what to me tastes like licorice, or something similar. Mouthfeel is just thick and coating, but in a completely awesome way because of the high carbonation, keeps things moving. It's like drinking velvet, the consistency is just so easygoing. That makes for an amazing oral sensation as well as drinkability. There's a little boozy presence on the finish but it settles right in, not too hot or anything. I could drink this forever. I want to give 5's all around, I really do. I'm severely tempted, but i think it's just a little too much of a sipper to earn perfect marks for drinkability and mouthfeel. Not quite perfection, but this is pretty damn close to it. While I'm still pretty early in my beer drinking life, this may be the best I've had so far. Now I want to cellar one, and see how much closer to 5s across I can get! 1,680 charactersdamienblack, Dec 30, 2008
4.38/5  rDev -2%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Reviewed on 5/7/08. Bottle. Pours a beautiful deep brown with a large light tan head that persists. Sorta looks like sludge, but it is the prettiest beer ever. Aroma of light fruits, raisin, Belgian yeast. Flavor of some smoked meat (first time have gotten that from Rochefort), Belgian yeast, dark fruits, chocolate, some booziness but it works for this beer. Very well balanced. Mouthfeel is extremely rich and hearty. My favorite beer and my first 5. 10/5/10/5/20
Update 12/26/08. Aroma of dark fruits (apple, pear) and raisins. Flavor of sweet fruits especially apple. Quite boozy in the finish. I do enjoy this beer but I think I rated it especially high because it was the first good beer I really loved. Always a pleasure though. I think the 8 is better however, this beer can certainly vary from bottle to bottle. Unfortunately, I have to lower this rating. 9/5/9/4/18 (4.5/5) 885 charactersLilBeerDoctor, Dec 29, 2008
4.29/5  rDev -4%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 42 fingers of foamy head top this beer in my tulip glass. The beer is a deep ruby red/amber color with some brown tones. Too deep in color to comment on clarity. Just the tiniest touch of lacing.
Aroma was very fruity and reminded me of sweet strawberries, dark grapes with lots of other stuff going on. Some thick deep malts and a whiff of alcohol. Really incredible aroma.
Wow, where to begin. Brown Sugar, alcohol, Deep dark caramel, dates, dark cherries.
As I drink this, I keep enjoying the aroma.. I think that's the most intoxicating part of this beer. Anyway, back to the flavor, there is also some nice spiciness happening. White pepper and some nutty tones as well. I love that it's so complex that I keep thinking about what I'm sensing.
The mouth feel was full bodied, slightly effervescent and very interesting. You get a sense of the alcohol, but it works nice with the deep flavors.
Certainly one to be savored, but very drinkable.
You can see why this is a sought after Belgian. Glad I purchased several bottles. I'm interested to see what happens with some age on this. 1,090 charactersReagan1984, Dec 28, 2008

poured into tulip.
brownish black and almost opaque, with amber brown tones under the light. nice tan head, fades to thin layer. some rings of lace here and there. yeast disturbs easily, but the brew is pretty opaque, so not really a problem visually.
fruity and mildly phenolic aroma, whiffs of alcohol. notes of dark caramel, raisins and dates, plus a fresh berry note as well. hints of coffee and spices.
flavor packs a similarly fruity and phenolic note upfront, with the caramel and sweet dried fruit underneath, with notes of cinnamon and anise. moderate bitterness from grassy euro hops. hint of acidity. alcohol is noticeable, but harmonized well with the fruit (cherry?) and phenols, which in this case are round and not sharp. grassy bitterness and hints of fruit and caramel in the finish, with reminiscences of coffee.
pretty smooth, though the alcohol, phenols and hops can give a sharp and almost astringent note. moderate, lively carbonation can be fluffy with rolled on the tongue.
a wonderful treat to have in china. 1,197 characterschinabeergeek, Dec 25, 2008

Rochefort 10 has a thick blood red body that's so dark it borders on black. When backlit there are glowing mahogany highlights where the light directly shines where massive amounts of carbonation explode to the surface. A superbly creamy beige head rose to a finger on the pour and didn't fall at all. Each drink leaves behind impressive sheet lacing and clumpy chunks. Now this is how a quad should look!
I don't know why but the nose is somewhat faint. Prunes, figs, and raisins are certainly in the profile along with a surprising, although faint, honey like sweetness. The yeast sends out all kinds of goodness; ripe banana and the mildest clove integrate perfectly into the nose of this brew. Rochefort 10 is all at once spicy, sweet and savory...I want to dive right in.
This one comes together perfectly on the tongue. Sweet notes of figs, prunes, dates and honey lie over the top of a savory somewhat spicy backbone that consists of clove, anise and deep dark caramel. Spicy alcohol peaks and falls again and again throughout each drink. The banana ester quality is barely noticeable in the flavor but adds a little something needed. This is how a quad should be and the leader of the pack in my opinion.
The body is medium and there's a highly active carbonation that creates a nice froth on the back of the tongue. Alcohol heat warms up the throat and nose but never gets hot on the tongue. The savory spiciness of this beer lingers after each sip and the dryness helps.
This is a big bad quad so it will never be easily slammable but this one goes down far too easily. It's a sipper to say the least but on a cold night like tonight I could sip the night away with this beauty.
Of the big 3; Westy, St. Bernardus and Rochefort, this is my favorite. The flavors are hugely complex but don't beat me over the head. It can be an easy enjoyable sipper or a beer to be dissected and contemplated. Whichever you prefer this is the quad to buy. 1,979 charactersjoe1510, Dec 24, 2008
4.45/5  rDev -0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5It poured out with a giant head. It might have been because I had some difficulty in opening the bottle, which made it bubble up so I had to pour a bit quicker than I would have. But its a dark brown with a few ruby red hues. The head is offwhite, and it lasted the entire time. I could even see bits of bubbles and sediment waiting around in the beer. The smell is yeast, and a bit of alcoholic sweetness. The taste is nearly perfect. I love the way all of the sweetness is perfectly balanced with the darkness, and even the good sweetness from the darker, roasted malts is extracted. If the alcohol content was just a little bit more subdued, namely if the bit of burnt alchohol taste was not present, I could've found a perfect 5 in this, but I really love it. The mouthfeel has adequate carbonation, a good amount of complexity from the darkeness and sweetness. And it drinks very well for the style. I could drink these until it caught up with me and knocked me on my ass. I will probably buy another at some point in the future. 1,034 characterstaylorhamrick, Dec 22, 2008

It is bright and fruity on the nose, with yellow apples, light sweet grass, cinnamon, raisin and wood. It is soft and fluffy yet lively on the tongue. It seems slightly acidic. It is well bittered and well balanced. The flavor is thick: chewy malt that hints at salty and even umami-- it spans the tonguge. World class!

4.47/5  rDev 0%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Got this at Green's on Ponce in Atlanta. Tasted back to back with the 8.
Pours an opaque dark brown color with a large two-finger light tan head. The head dissipates into a wispy layer of bubbles on top and a thick ring around the glass. Lacing is decent, and there are a good amount of floaties in the glass.
Smells of bready malt up front, joined by plums and raisins and a bit of sweet Belgian candy sugar. The smell is much maltier than the 8, and while it's cold it's somewhat similar to a winter warmer. The alcohol is definitely noticeable after the beer warms a bit.
Tastes great. There's a robust malt flavor that's somewhat bready and somewhat spicy. Dark fruit flavors hit midway through the sip and are joined by a bit of molasses. It's not quite as fruity as most other quads that I've had, but the maltiness is a nice change. Alcohol is noticeable throughout, but never is it overpowering.
Mouthfeel is good. It's velvety, but not quite as much so as the 8. Grainy carbonation and a good thickness make it go down smoothly.
Drinkability is great for an 11.3% ABV beer. This really does go down very easily. I could have more than a few of these.
Overall this is a very tasty beer, but I think I give the edge to the 8. The 10 is very bold and the flavors all work together very well, but I think the 8 has just a tad more balance and is more drinkable. That being said, both of these should be tried by everyone. 1,432 charactersglid02, Dec 19, 2008
4.1/5  rDev -8.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5A: Very dark brown / purple color. Rowdy head -- maybe I should not have poured it straight down the glass. Expected yeasty floaters from bottle conditioning.
S: Caramel sweet scents with dark fruit notes. Certainly a yeast-driven smell. Alcohol warmth detected by the nose. Hot orange?
T: Spicy notes dominate with phenols that stick around. Alcohol flavor is very much present. Finishes very dry. Not quite as smooth as others in this category (namely St.B 12) ~ the dominance of alcohol flavor is a bit of a put-off for me.
As the beer warms, the alcohol flavor gets a little peppery, and as it warms a little more, the alcohol notes are a bit more muted (less sharp). Later, brandy flavors show up.
MF: Light bodied for such a strong beer. Seems a little less alive than other examples (effervescence). 
D: A very nice beer. Are the standards raised because it is made by Trappist Monks? Probably. Is that fair? Probably.
Are my expectations raised after reading how BA Mag rated this the "best beer of all time"? Yes. The fact that this is made by monks in a tradition that is centuries old does not improve the appearance, smell, taste, or mouthfeel, but it does improve the drinkability from a historical perspective. 1,230 charactersMerkinMan, Dec 17, 2008

The aroma is spicy with some nice intermingling of the sweet chocolate maltyness and the spicy yeast notes. 
The flavor carries through the spicy flavors from the esters and it also presents a sweet carmely malt flavor. Nice carbonation up front this beer segues into a creamy finish that has a hint of warmth at the end.
Nicely drinkable this beer goes down smooth although it has a higher alcohol content which would make it a poor session beer this is much more of a nightcap. 607 charactersRenoZymurgist, Dec 16, 2008

4.6/5  rDev +2.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4I'll admit that I'm a bit partial to this beer, as it's the one that got me into good beer in the first place - but hey, it's a classic for a reason. This review is somewhat of an aggregate of numerous experiences in a way (regarding how it ages).
330ml poured into a chalice. Best before July 16th, 2013 @ 7:44am (I love the specific hour!) - so recently bottled.
A - Dark brownish-red color with three-fingered tan head. Definitely unfiltered as you can see the sediment floating about in the glass. The head takes forever to dissipate and leaves a very attractive lace behind.
S - Roasted malt barley, dark fruits, raisins & prunes, caramel & molasses. It's also initially a little smoky and understated, but sweetens and comes alive as the beer warms up. I think it's a touch boozy - probably a bit too hot at such a young age.
T - Sweet - mostly malt character and raisins. Not as boozy as it smells, but retains the same depth of flavors. There's a little bit of oak character at the top of the palate, possibly from the high ABV.
M - Smooth, but only medium-bodied - a little watery for my tastes. There's a stickyness that corresponds to the sweet flavor, and the carbonation is just enough.
D - Not drinkable in mass quantities due to the ABV and the sweetness, but a fantastic brew in all other respects.
This one never lets me down, even after all these years (first had this in 2003). 1,403 charactersMasterSki, Dec 15, 2008

Strong pruney raisin smell. Smells very vinous. Taste is strong -- lots of dry raisin and dark grape. Darker taste. Similar to St Bernardus Abt 12, but overall I didn't find nearly as much complexity in this brew. This is one of the most overrated beers on both this site and ratebeer. Still very enjoyable, however, especially if you like the Belgian Abbott/Quadrupels. I'm also not that big of a fan of the style, so that may sway my view as well. If you like quadrupels, you'll love this beer either way. 549 charactersVendetta, Dec 14, 2008

Opaque mahogany hue with a two finger light tan head that slowly settles to a thick cap. 
Creamy aromas with a little bit of dark fruit. A touch of spiciness. Some licorice is in there as well. 
The spicy licorice is in full force in the flavor, along with a bit of raisin. Some phenols appear in the middle. Full bodied. The licorice lingers for a while.
A very nice and drinkable quad. Low on the phenols and high on the licorice. Probably one of my favorite quads to date. 511 charactersBeerSox, Dec 14, 2008
4.44/5  rDev -0.7%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Appearance: Trappistes Rochefort 10 pours a dark brown-to-burgundy red colour along with a thick, creamy, but rather short, beige crown that persists for a great amount of time. 
Smell: Much like cherries or plums soaked in cognac, notes of dark bread can be hinted along with some pears.
Taste: Oh sweet Zombie-Jesus! Mellifluously corresponding to the taste, we get a cognac-meets-cherry accompanmied by a tad of maltiness along with some vanilla/chocolate ice cream; finished of with plenty of alcohol in the aftertaste. 
Now, in nine times of out ten times I would've found a high amount of alcohol in the flavour to be disturbing the equilibrium of the tasting experience. However not in this case, how come? I mean, sure, here the alcohol gives itself away more than usual, but it does so in such a sophisticated manner that it moreso completes than it dominates the taste (see 'Mouthfeel').
Mouthfeel: Rather full and creamy, medium-low in carbonation and with a great feeling of warmth (because of the alcohol) that spread through the palate pleasingly, much like in the case of a great cognac or bourbon!

Looked like instant coffee before you add milk, head was bubbly and porous, that fizzed away quickly.
While the head was there I got scents of vanilla, but that soon gave way to a malty backbone, then grape, apple and sherry.
Hint of a burgundy wine in there, strong alcohol content, hint of maltyness to finish it off.
Very effervescent, exploded on the tongue like something you'd see in an adult film!
Pretty belchy, but enjoyable even with strong alcohol content

Pours a beautiful dark brown sugar color with a perfectly forming right creamy tan head. Excellent retention and lacing. 
Wow, smells awesome. Pears carmelized in brown sugar. Rich malts. There is a slight hint of oxidation that has manifested itself in the form of a coca-cola flavor with a hint of peppermint. Some booze soaked dates and Raisins. 
Oxidation a little more present in the taste - maybe a bit of a rusty metallic note, but not dominating. A lot of the same flavors, but a bit more fruitiness. Rich malts and stewed dark fruits. Brown sugar. Nicely carbonation as the appearance indicated, creating a very satisfying medium-bodied mouthfeel. Very drinkable for its abv and the level of complexity is very high. A definite winner, fresh or aged - I really wouldn't see a need to push it more than 5 years though. 871 charactersIneedabeerhere, Dec 06, 2008

Nose is heavier in the malt, with toffee and alcohol prominent. Lighter mouthfeel than the 8. Malts, dates, and currants dominate the taste.

I first tried it years ago while I was in the military in Europe. I recently bought 12 bottles directly from Belgium. Shipping was a killer but still worth it. Everything about this beer is near perfect. Very strong but alcohol is hidden very well. Deep dark color with a nice tan head. Smells like heaven.

D: The tastes in this beer are quite complex as is typical with Belgian's....this is classicly Belgian with an ABV that will kick you right in the crotch in a heartbeat. I find the alcohol isn't quite as blended in with this one, it's lurking it's biting head. One glass is about the extent of any indulging of this one.

4.35/5  rDev -2.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.511/22/08- Purchased at Jackson's Wine and Spirits in Lafayette, CA.
Presentation- 11.2oz bottle, best by 2009. Poured into my Rochefort chalice. Has been aged for 3 years or so.
Appearance- Murky brown caramel colored pour. Average amount of yeast settles to the bottom of the glass. Leaves some light trails of lace. Smaller 1/4 inch head...which is a bit off white.
Smell- Sweet notes of milk chocolate, alcohol soaked dark fruits and some roasted malts. Caramel as well.
Taste- Sweeter than Westy. Caramel flavor comes through during the whole beer. Alcohol is not really noticable. Dates and figs add to the high level of sweetness with a small amount of chocolate flavor.
Mouthfeel- Lower carbonation with a definite full mouthfeel. Lasting sweetness and sticky caramel coating.
Drinkability- I'm kinda wishing I would have tried one last year. I think the aging has affected it for the worse. I've had a few fresh and they were a bit better than this. Still an excellent beer, but prefer them fresher. 1,013 charactersGClarkage, Nov 23, 2008
4.28/5  rDev -4.3%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Appearance: Black with dark brown at the edges. No light shows through. The head is tan and thick with a combination of creamy foam and large bubbles. The head has good retention. The lacing is minimal, but where it does hang, it hangs in clumps.
Aroma: Sweet and fruity with plenty of maltiness, maybe some licorice hints. The alcohol is obvious in the aroma.
Mouthfeel: Medium body with a lot of creaminess. The carbonation is light and perfect for my tastes.
Taste: Definitely malty with a caramel and pepper present. It has bite, but it doesn't TASTE of strong alcohol, though it definitely warms as it goes down. The hops are very subtle and seemingly only there for balance. 
Overall impression: This was not what i was expecting to be honest. I have not loved many Belgians. This one, however, I like quite a bit. It is definitely a sipping beer and at the prices they go for here, probably one I'll sip infrequently. Though, when i do, I'll enjoy it! 962 charactersjkendrick, Nov 20, 2008
4.27/5  rDev -4.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Served in a Chimay goblet. Pours a dense mahogany brown color with a lot of light coming through when held to a light. Reddish highlights and a small white head. Head retention is brief, a result of the 11.3 abv.
Smell is great. Dark fruit, Candi sugar and a hint of alcohol. Very inviting.
Taste was a bit of a disappointment. I was expecting more complexity from a top rated beer. This beer semed more basic, some sweetnessand spiciness up front and a little bitterness at the end. The alcohol was well hidden
Mouthfeel was good, nice and rich. Drinkability is good. The lack of harsh alcohol taste and the smoothness make this very drinkable despite the abv.
I still like St Bernadus abt 12 better as a Quad. 715 charactersJayQue, Nov 19, 2008
4.27/5  rDev -4.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Bottle at the Only Cafe in Toronto. Poured a deep clouded mahogany, with a finger of smooth, creamy off-white head. It is very similar in appearance to the 8, but leaves far less lacing. Very dark nose, with lots of phenols and yeasty spiciness. Certainly less oak than the 8, and more sweeter aromas. Luxurious layers of chocolate and caramel in the flavour make this almost more like a dessert than a beer, and definitely contributing to a full-bodied, filling experience. There's also dark fruit in abundance, particularly candied dates, and a nice Belgian spiciness from the yeast strain. Extremely smooth in the mouth...almost creamy. A minor complaint would be that the carbonation was not ideal, and its moderation did make the mouthfeel a little too heavy, which was reinforced by the richness of the flavours.
This is an extremely complex beer, and one that all Belgian lovers should endeavour to try. I did enjoy it a lot, but did not find it to be a stellar leap over other classics, and in fact I though the Rochefort 8 was superior in terms of appearance and mouthfeel. In terms of quads, this kicks almost all of them into touch, and from the ones I have had, only St. Bernardus would beat it in my eyes. 1,219 charactersbobsy, Nov 17, 2008
4.33/5  rDev -3.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Had the 8 and now for the 10!
A: Very dark red brown and exceptionally hazy. Lovely fluffy finger head that looked like someone sprinkled cinnamon on it. Nice spotty lacing.
S: Strong phenols, rum, dark fruit and sweet malt.
T: Wow. Not what I expected. Lovely creamy sweet malty taste with a subtle rum. Some sweet chocolate and some dark fruit. A little medicinal with warming alcohol of course - what would you expect with this ABV! The alcohol developed more wallop as the drink progressed.
M: Incredibly creamy and smooth - a little sharp alcohol at the finish. The sharpness probably has hops too but with this much alcohol, it's hard to pin point it. Medium body.
D: This drink plain scares me. I have had beers at a third of the ABV that were harder to drink. This is such a decadent beer. It makes you feel special. It makes you remember that beer is not a drink to pound down or at least not always. Amazing. Quite an experience. You have to try it. 964 characterssgoodship, Nov 16, 2008
4.69/5  rDev +4.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Poured into chalice. Nice look to this one: deep mahogany brown. Thick, off-white head. 
Incredible aroma unlike any beer I've sniffed before. Loads of fruity sweetness: grapes and raisins mainly, along with caramel. Alcohol is very well disguised.
Taste is just like the aroma. There is a warming effect, but this beer does not taste close to 11.3% abv. There's even more caramel in the taste, and the feel is silky smooth and delicious. Really buttery (a tad odd but delicious) and fruity. A bit of roast and chocolate in the aftertaste. Dark fruits come through as well. Carbonation is high and effervescent but also very smooth. 
Outstanding. One of the best I've ever had. 680 charactersdasenebler, Nov 14, 2008
4.69/5  rDev +4.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5A- Dark reddish brown, almost black when not held to the light. Poured with thick, creamy white head.
S- Fruity, sweet, and alcoholic. Perhaps a slight earthiness, perhaps from the yeast.
T- Malty sweet, very similar to Chimay blue, but with less yeastiness and more alcoholic warmth, especially after it's been swallowed.
M- Coats the mouth. Some carbonation on the sides of the tougue.
D- At 11. 3% ABV drinkability is subjective. But for this level of alcohol it's as drinkable as it gets. 496 characterserok, Nov 14, 2008
4.42/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5This Quad lived up to all the potential that has accumulated on this site. It was and 11oz bottle poured into a large wine glass (my snifter was on loan to my neighbor). I must admit drinking from a large wine glass proved to be a great drinking experience. It allowed to the nose to hold in the glass and the head to maintain longer than I have heard. 
It poured a dark coffee brown, with a white-ish caramel colored head. The head maintained within a 1/4 inch from original pour throughout drinking, and left remarkable lace. The nose was robust and full of earthiness, figs, other dark fruits, with a touch of alcohol and spun sugar.
The drinkablity it amazing. The smooth fullness could easily lead to a fast drink, but be patient, the taste is exceptional. It is not as sweet as you would think from the nose but the perfect balance between the alcohol, wheat, sugar, dried fruit, and carbonation prove to be a great taste and feel combination.
Everyone should enjoy this beer at some time before they die. 1,014 charactersGoodOldDuke, Nov 13, 2008
4.63/5  rDev +3.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.75From 11 oz bottle into Midnight Sun goblet at appropriate temp. Amazingly available from the one and only liquor store in the tiny (800 folks in the winter) Alaskan town where I live. Thank you Robert (manager of liquor store). And, no, we can't see Russia.
The large, vigorous tan head settled quickly. Minimal lacing. Medium/dark brown, corffee like, hazy and thick. A little chunky. Inviting. UPDATED: Beauty. Thick tan foam, with plenty of lacing.
Heavenly aroma. This would ultimately be the strongest category for this beer for me. Complex, malty sweetness with dark dried fruit accents. Relatively faint alcohol in the nose, considering the size of the beer.
ORIGINAL REVIEW:Taste is malty base with alcohol and and dark dried fruit blending, but without as much complexity as in the nose. Some sort of bitterness intersects with these other flavors, but I don't think it is hops. Maybe this flavor is a dryness from all the fermented candy sugar? It finishes dry. This beer did not taste as sweet as I expected, nor was it as full and satisfying as some other quads that I may like better, but are not as revered. 
UPDATED: RIch, sweet, malty, dark fruity, and yeast. Wicked complex. World class. 
Some tingly carbonation and moderate warming, especially toward the back of the tongue. Not as full as I expected, and, again, as some other quads. UPDATED: Must have been an older bottle before, as this is plenty full bodied. Still a bit on the hot side. 
This goes down way too easily for something that is such an expensive treat. Very balanced with a modestly dry finish.
Surely a great beer, but I'd probably get a Koeningshoven or a Quadrium before this one. In deference to the beer and brewer, who knows how this beer has changed since in left Belgium for Alaska. I think I like Pannepot better, but this is a world class brew. 1,847 characterssprucetip, Nov 13, 2008
4.3/5  rDev -3.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.511.2 oz. bottle poured into a chalice
Pours a dark reddish brown with about a finger of light tan head that exhibits fairly good retention. Smells pretty good, some nice malty sweetness, some dark fruit esters and a complex alcohol aroma. The aroma here is very vinous with lots dark fruits such as plums, figs, and dark cherries. Alcohol aroma is both spicy and a bit like perfume. Taste is much like the aroma. Initially its fairly malty but sweetness quickly builds. The dark fruit esters are a constant and lurk just beneath the sweetness. As this brew warms a bit the flavors actually seem to come together a bit more; they mellow a bit and this becomes much more balanced. Mouthfeel is pretty good, medium-light+ in body with high carbonation. There is a very prominent alcohol presence here but its not overwhelming or harsh as the alcohol takes on perfume like characteristics. Drinkability is pretty good. I had expected a bit more out of this beer but it was enjoyable none-the-less. 994 charactersmnj21655, Nov 13, 2008

Appearance: Raisin brown body, with some nice tan film. Lacing is by far the best I've ever seen - as it just coats the glass.
Smell: Brown sugar nose, with notes of fig and alcohol.
Taste: Big malt character which primarily tastes of fig, moves to a big alcohol backdrop. However, it's executed perfectly and extremely welcomed. Lots of sweet sugar cane come through, as well as some peppery spice. Near the top of the tastiest quads in my book.
Mouthfeel: Very smooth - luscious. Really enjoy the 
Drinkabiltiy: With the high alcohol - this guy is a sipper, and the alcohol makes it a bit tough to knock down. That said, paired with some nice artisanal cheeses and candied fruits - and you have yourself an enjoyable experience. 789 charactersbigkahunas4, Nov 12, 2008

A- Deep, murky brown. Pours with ~1 finger of tan/white head, which fades rapidly, leaving a thin ring. A look through the light reveals a profound mixture of sediments. No lacing noted.
S- Alcohol odors mingling with a fruity/port/raisiny mix.
T- Slightly sweet fruitiness followed by a slight alcohol bittering/warming effect. Grows increasingly more delicious throughout consumption. Aftertaste is fantastic.
M- Has a nice "tiny bubble" infusion feel. A smooth sipper.
D- Considering the high ABV, this one seems surprisingly drinkable.

A: pours dark brown with a light highlight, opaque, with a tan tightly-beaded head. good lacing as the beer is consumed.
S: chocolate, caramel, light raisin but dominated by the caramel
T: starts with a chocolaty flavor that moves into a fig, prune-like taste, with slightly warm alcohol at the finish mixed with raisin/prune/dark fruit. Caramel and molasses also present in the flavor, joined by toffee and hints of licorice; little to no hop presence and a somewhat sweet finish balanced by the alcohol.
M: medium body to the beer, with sweetness contributing to a sticky, viscous feel. carbonation light and helps bring out the flavors.
D: A very flavorful and complicated beer, if you concentrate you can pick out its various characteristics. would love to be pairing this with a desert as it seems lonely to consume all on its own. 883 charactersjoeysmokedporter, Nov 11, 2008

4.77/5  rDev +6.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Poured from an 11.2 oz. bottle into a snifter.
Appears very dark brown and hazy with a one inch off-white head that gradually sinks to a centimeter thick skim. Some spotty lacing is left behind.
Aroma is full of candi sugar, dark fruits, some spiciness, brown sugar, also a bit of creaminess that I can't quite place other than to say it's kind of like sugar cookie dough.
The taste starts off with lots of sugary sweetness up front with flavors of raisin, fig, plum, caramelized sugars, and a very small touch of chocolate. Towards the end it gets more yeasty and spicy with a light earthiness in the linger along with some warming alcohol.
Mouthfeel is medium-light but very creamy and soft on the palate. Very nice carbonation level. Very drinkable for being 11.3% ABV.
Probably the best Quad that I have had to date. Still got a Westy 12 to drink soon though so we shall see if that stands. 899 charactersroadhouse, Nov 08, 2008
4.65/5  rDev +4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Pours a very dark ruby brown color with a nice off white head.
Scent of dark fruits, alcohol, robust buttery malts, yeast and candi sugar. Excellent stuff, velvety smooth, strong as hell, full and rich.
Taste of rich, buttery malts with dark fruits to balance, alcohol is apparent, but adds a nice strength to the beer. Alcohol burn lingers throughout the taste giving a nice strength which balances very well with the flavor. Finishes dry with some marshmallow, dark fruits, and earthy malts.
Mouthfeel is perfectly smooth with a huge bite from the alcohol, and even with that it is quite drinkable.
As far as I'm concerned, this is on par with Westvleteren 12, and seeing as I have immediate availability to this beer, I prefer this one. 743 characterspaco1029384756, Nov 07, 2008

A little mocha, alcohol and malt on the nose
Alcohol cooks off the nose as it sits, lots of espresso, some licorice and a bit of dry cocoa... Very good and super multigeared, finishes bitter with a little alcohol still.
Great mouthfeel, dances on the tongue.

Especially at the end of a great evening. It's a pity that it's less spicy than it used to be and has become sweeter as well according to the general trend. But still.

4.38/5  rDev -2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A- Pours a murky brown color with a nice creamy tan colored head. The head has great retention and becomes a bubbly layer on top of the brew and leaves a tremendous amount of lacing. I could also see a few floaters in there of yeast.
S- Pretty laid back here but I could pick tons of sweetness (maybe brown sugar), dark fruits (plums), a touch of alcohol and some malts.
T- This is a really tasty brew. Bread crust, dark fruits, and some chocolate raisins. Alcohol appears in the finish.
M- Medium in body, a little high in carbonation but goes down really smooth.

A= This ale poured a murky, dark cola-brown color with a 1/2" light tan head. The head retetnion was incredible, staying nearly full height all the way down the glass. Lots of active carbonation release. Moderate sticky lace present.
S= Lots of sweetness and complexity in the aromas of this one. I found sweet dark fruits, rum soaked raisins, brown sugar, carob, and a moderate yeasty funk. 
T= There was an incredible malt presence in this beer, producing flavors of bakery sweetness, treacle, molasses, and carmelized sugar. The yeast added a slight funk as well as mildy fruity esters, raisins, and candied fruits. The finish was warm and boozy, in an incredibly good way. 
MF= Medium to heavy bodied with all of that Belgian effervescence on fine display. Though the carbonation is relatively high, the mouth still feels delicate and easy on this one. 
D= A world class sipper and still one of my top 5 favorite Belgian ales. Worthy of all the hype. Despite the ABV, I could happily drink a few of these in an evening. 1,112 charactersspointon, Oct 31, 2008
4.42/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Bout time I rated this beer. Pours a mostly hazy brown color with a ruby red hue throughout. A velvet while head with good retention and lacing. Though did hide to the edge of the glass.
The nose is rich with malt and nice phenolics and esters. To start with there is a huge sweet caramel note that I usually associate with Special B. Maybe a bit much but some kettle notes kind of balance it out. Some noticeable fruit notes. Bit plums and raisins. Noticeable bananas, pineapples, plums and bubblegum. Some yeasty characteristics as well as a light rose peddle on the back end.
The taste is more in balance. But there is a sweetness from the malt that is a bit strong even for a Belgian Strong. Super caramel with plums and raisin tastes. A hint of chocolate and some bready notes on the back end. Becomes more detectable as it warms. The yeast really comes out nicely and does a good job balancing the malt. Very nice phenolics with some cloves and a light banana. Nice figs and prunes. Some alcohol but not over the top. Some lighter vanilla and a
The body is big as expected. Very smooth overall with a silky texture. Great complexity. Carbonation is light for style but does allow all the flavors to come out. Some heat from the alcohol is a bit of a deterrent. Overall a great quad with some minor malt notes that IMO are off. Great yeast representation with a bit of heat but still very nice. 1,402 charactersOxymoron, Oct 30, 2008

Pour this carefully cause the head is rather explosive. Very nice lacing, the head never really disappears, it just coats the glass all the way down.
Smell is amazing, so many aromas detected. From dark fruits like raisins, and a caramel nuttiness with a hint of vanilla to a very nice spiciness. Almost a buttery richness to the aroma. I can detect some alcohol on the end.
Much like the smell, this beer tastes fantastic! A very delicious caramalized malt flavor, rich in toffee figiness up front followed by a very mild alcohol taste which does nothing but warm your insides. The alcohol is so well hidden in this brew its scary considering the ABV.
This is a full bodied brew, a very rich and the awesome taste lingers in your mouth, begging for another sip. This is by no means a sessionable beer, however the drinkability on this is astounding. 962 charactersSoneast, Oct 30, 2008

A- Pure brown with tints of dark red. Nice foamy head gathered and laced the glass as the beer was consumed. 
S- Smell of dark fruits and malts were overpowering.
T- Tasted just like the aroma. A nice mixture of fruit (prunes, raisins, plums) and alcohol followed by sweet taste of malt.
M- Medium feel with a decent amount of carbonation. A nice smooth burn settled in the chest and stomach as the beer was consumed.
D- If it weren't for the 11.3% abv. it would be hard to put this one down. 
This beer makes me question whether IPA/DIPA are my favorite style. The aroma and taste combined with the nice burn of alcohol truly give one hell of an experience.
Poured from an 11.2 oz bottle into a snifter. 2003 vintage. Part 2 of rhinos00 vintage beer night.
A- Pours a dark amber. Had a semi-hazy appearance. Produces a fingers width of off white head. 
S- Not as rich and potent as I had hoped for. Still, plenty of of raisin goodness to go around. Lots of sweet, burnt malts as well. Little bit of alcohol to boot.
T- Still a great tasting beer with 6 years on it. Not as dramatic of a change as I had hoped for. Raisins, plums and grapes all combine to give off a nice dark fruit flavor. As usual had a great malt backbone. Little flat in the finish.
M- Nice viscosity. Well carbonated, even after all these years. Not much to complain about here. Medium body feel.
D- Very drinkable indeed. You get a nice alcohol burn in the chest after a few sips. 
Overall, I won't lie...I was expecting a little more from this beer. It still had an awesome flavor, but it did not improve from the most recent vintage I have had.

A gorgeous tight and frothy head rises up with tiny little bubble and amazing retention. Leaves spots of sticky lacing down the glass and doesn't fade below a nice cap for the entire session.

It also has a distinct leathery aroma that I find appealing. Great taste as well. Nice spice and yeast that compliment the other flavors of this brew. Some brown sugar is added to the mix. Caramel is still there and the chocolate is also present. A superb mouthfeel that is so soft and creamy on the tongue. Silky smooth with a slight peppery spice to compliment the feel toward the end. Just the slightest warm dryness in the finish but a welcome one indeed, reminding one that this is a sipper to savor. I really like this one.

Pours a deep dark purple color along the side of my snifter. After sitting the glass straight up, an angled line of foam stays behind. With a tad left, I swirl the bottle and pour the remains into the center of the glass. This leaves an egg shape foam mound 1/4" high that settles after the intense bubbles finish coming up from the bottom. 
Smells of the darkest of dark fruit, plum, raisin, grapes, blackberry. There is also a sugary alcoholic smell of brown sugar and some molasses.
Definately molasses and with some burnt/very smokey caramel. Lots of plum and raisin. A very sweet brew indeed.

4.55/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours with little to no head.
The color is an opaque dull brown or crimson.
Smells strongly of figs and something deep, rich, and sweet--a cross between malty and buttery.
The taste begins almost like a dry stout, with a bit of a smoky feel to it. This progresses into something much more sweet and tangy--a taste similar to the smell. The finish remains tangy but is also faintly reminiscent of a milk chocolate (not dark chocolate like many stouts, porters, etc.). Not a milk chocolate like Mackesons XXX, or anything that predominate, but still present.
Definitely hides the 11.3% abv well.

A--Like Dad's root beer. High carbonation maintaining persistent creamy head and lacing.
S--Sweet. Floral and fragrant. Faint alcohol and spice.
T--First taste reminiscent of a porter's burnt nuttiness rather than a belgian ale...except sweet--not bitter. Alcohol/spice combo warming and prominent. Deep fruity esthers--plum? Extremely well balanced. Excellent.
Every sip better as it the beer warms and I warm from the non-boozy tasting potency.
M--Creamy and chewy but smooth. Tickles the tastebuds and linger complexly on palate.
D--Upon taste, wouldn't have guessed 11.3 ABV. But this is serious stuff. A warming sipper. 667 characterslarsee01, Sep 28, 2008
4.35/5  rDev -2.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured a deep brown with reddish tint. A huge fluffy tan head formed and left tons of lacing behind. Excellent head retentions.
Tons of grape in the nose. Not like grape soda though. Like grape mixed with malt, chocolate and figs. 
Taste follows the nose. Slightly more soda like qualities but it is faint and at the front of the palate. Super malty with lot of fig, grape, raisin, and chocolate.
Mouthfeel is lighter than I expected. Still very full, flavor just coats every inch of your mouth and makes it seem heavier than it is. 
Alcohol let you know that it is there, but over all, very drinkable. 606 charactersbrantadid, Sep 24, 2008
4.16/5  rDev -6.9%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Poured from a bottle purchased at McNalty's Bier Markt in Cleveland although later I saw it for sale for less ($6.99) at World Wine and Liquor in Mentor, Ohio. None the less...
A Before I even open it...I see major sediment even near the top of the bottle. close inspection of the bottom (in strong light) revealed moderate to severe amount of sediment on the bottom. After opening...3 finger head over a deep, dark brown body which no light gets through.
S malty hops complex wonderfulness. Alcohol is perceptible.
T Initially a complex, malty, hoppy trappist with a wonderful malty, molasses sweetness just before there is this punch in the face of alcohol, reminds me of having a shot right after a beer (never had that but I am imagining). The aftertaste is more of the initial taste, a complex, hoppy trappist like I was expecting. 
M Full, possibly one of the fullest not called a stout or a porter. The sting of alcohol is part of the mouthfeel.
D This is a complex, interesting beer but there is a bomb of alcohol in the mid taste that is unmistakable and drives down the drinkability.
Notes: I certainly respect this beer. It has an uncommon complexity that is rare. It has that great begginning and just before the punch of alcohol there is a wonderful sweet, malty taste but then that tremendous body slam of alcohol followed by a long aftertaste of complex malt and hops. 1,389 charactersadamette, Sep 23, 2008
3.93/5  rDev -12.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5The 10 pours an exceptionally dark brown, which in a backlight has tints of ruby, topped with a light tan head that disappears fairly quickly. The nose of Rochefort 10 is at first very sweet, as is to be expected for a beer of 11.3% abv, with coffee and even banana notes. At one point I stuck my nose right into the glass and inhaled deeply, and while it took me four or five breaths to really work out the smell, it was a distinct tinge of nail polish remover or alcohol laced with molasses.
Drinking the ale was a delight, and I found it smoother than the Rochefort 8 yet with the same chocolate and cocoa flavours. Being so dark and full, the 10 is a very rich beer, and definitely not a beer that you would want to be drinking as though it was a run of the mill lager. Despite the smoothness of the beer, there is also a slight touch of bitterness adding a nice counterpoint to the sweetness, like burnt caramel. In the final taste though there was a distinct alcohol taste. 980 charactersvelkyal, Sep 22, 2008

S: A complex fruit aroma with tons of malt. Grapes, figs, plums. A hint of chocolate.
T: A malty and fruity taste that follows the nose. Grapes and plums seem to dominate. Caramel and chocolate malt as well. A snap of carbonation and spice that do not mesh well for me.
M/D: This seems over carbonated for my tastes. It does not seem to have the huge coat of the mouth that 8 does IMO. Drinkability is good. Plenty of rum like alcohol to make this a sipping beer.
This is a very complex and well crafted beer. I enjoy it, but my heart lies with Rockefort 8. 673 characterschamp103, Sep 20, 2008

This ends up sitting in the glass a hefty and intimidating mahogany. Good luck trying to see anything on the other side of the glass. The golden tan head starts out fluffy then recedes more tightly and thinly sticking all over the glass. Amazing looking.
S: The aromas are beyond complex. Initially, there is a heavy presence of plum, figs, and grapes. Pepper and sweet sugars coupled with strong hints of lavender, coconut, yeast, and dark malts. As if black cherries took a warm cocoa and bourbon bath. The chocolate and toffee undertones are very mellow but highlight throughout. There is so much happening here that any scent of alcohol has been extinguished.
T: Again, just as complex as the smell. Warming caramel, maple, and peppers. A buttery tartness with raisin background. Darker fruits got doused in chocolate and then smoked over an oak and caramel fire. Buttery licorice charred with molasses soaked banana peels. The alcohol is so well hidden that I thought this was a dessert and not a beer.
M: Full bodied. Very rich, velvety, and creamy. Each sip warming and long lasting.
D: Delicious and beyond drinkable. Tough to even do this one justice. 1,254 characterserikm25, Sep 18, 2008

Very pleasant taste. The alcohol is there but not over the top for the %. I like it alot.
Working my way up the quad ladder before trying a westy12 next year. This one is very good and I certainly like it a hell of a lot better than St. Bernardus 12.
Excellent feel to this rich thick creamy stew. Then the alcohol says hey buddy on the way down. Nice to know you're drinking 11.3%, which is absoulutely awesome in this beer.

The taste is the same as the smell its gets much more dimensional and complex as it warms
The mouthfeel is very smooth but a tad thinner than most Belgium's im used to drinking

4.72/5  rDev +5.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4My 100th review! I thought I ought to celebrate this BA milestone with something special.
It opens with a loud hiss and pours from the 330ml brown bottle into a globe glass. It has a very dark brown, somewhat murky appearance with lots of head. The head settles into a 2" layer on top and diminishes very slowly. Almost no lacing left behind.
The aroma is spectacular - rich in fruits, nuts, spice, and alcohol. Many times I go just for a sniff instead of a sip.
The taste is exceptional as well. So much depth and so many layers to it. The list of fruits goes on and on: cherries, figs, raisins, currants, bananas, etc. There's spices galore, mostly ones that remind me of Christmas: cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, and pepper. Then there's that distinctive Belgian yeast and, of course, lots of alcohol. It's all very well balanced and enjoyable as a slow sipper of a beer. It almost seems a shame to call it "beer" when it's clearly much more than that.
Mouthfeel is okay given the style but it's high in carbonation and ABV so it's not the gentlest thing on the palate. Drinkabiliy suffers for the same reasons.
This is an incredible beer and one that shoots straight to the top of my favorites. I can't think of anything else I've tried that has so much going on. It's simply magnificent.
Edit: A year later to the day (completely by accident) I am revisiting this beer and enjoying it as much or more than the first time. Dated for the last day of 2013, this is still reasonably fresh. Mouthfeel is better than I remembered being much softer on the palate. Still one of my favorites. 1,588 charactersGilGarp, Sep 11, 2008

4.32/5  rDev -3.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4This beer pours a hazy dark brown/reddish hue with a small creamy off-white head. The nose is a combination of dark fruits like raisins and figs, candy sugar, slight banana, fruity esters, and you can smell the alcohol in this beer as well. The taste is quite complex with the main players being banana, dark fruit, caramel sweetness, vanilla, and some peppery spices. A really nice combination of flavors and they work really well together in this Quad. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and quite smooth with moderate carbonation, and I certainly get the warming alcohol on the mouthfeel as well. The drinkability is really quite nice for a beer that is 11.3% ABV, but it is a sipper and not your everyday type beer. 715 charactersTheodorHerzl, Sep 08, 2008
4.65/5  rDev +4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I've just bought a new Rochefort glass (the one with the writings and top profile in gold) so I could not dispense myself to have a Rochefort 10.
The appearance starts from the bottle, so simple and so impressive: Trappistes Rochefort is written in a font that arouses respect, with that pale yellow backgrounfd and the big dot that says "10"... and then the beer: so brown and dark , but still luminescent, with that tick, dense foam that stays there forever, the right thing in the right place, like the cord on the tunic of the monks.
Smell is of dark sugar, liquor, choccolate, cocoa and something toasted, more pungent than other quadrupels. Great.
Taste is a bit herbal, bready, peppery, again something toasted. Mouthfeel is where Rochefort 10 gives its best: the little carbonation leaves a hint of water that suddenly gives place to a smooth and creamy sensation that finishes with a very well balance on the taste side, not dry, not bitter, not sweet, a little tart.
Drinkability.... you can have just one and be very happy, or still want for more. This is a serious beer, I prefer have one and meditate on how great it is. 1,133 charactersVoss, Sep 08, 2008

Pours a murky dark brown color. Very nice 3 finger dark head. Nice semi-foamy lacing too. Sediment in the bottle too which I like.
Very nice aroma on this one. It is sweet with the smells of raisons, flowers, fruits, caramel like smells, malts, etc. Hard to pin anything specific down as it smells very complex.
Taste is very good. Lots of nice malts, semi sweet tastes too, raisons and caramel. There is also some coffee like tastes and some bitterness too. As others have said, it does almost have a medicinal taste to it as well. The finish tastes very medicinal and is very strong and somewhat tingly. Very nice mouthfeel, and drinkable.
Overall this is a very good beer. The Trappist's really know how to make a good one. 765 charactersNHGrafx, Sep 06, 2008

Pours a dark, thick brown with no light seeping through. A lot of chunks and has a thick off-white head. Aroma is off honey and fruit, slight maltiness. Taste is complex, some ripe fruits and malts, but on the sweet side. Texture is excellent, on the chewy side and is thick and heavy. A very good session beer, but with the high ABV and since it is on the sweet side no more than a couple at a sitting. Very enjoyable beer, one of my favorites. 582 characterstbeck, Sep 05, 2008

Smell was raisin bread. Peanut skins. Strangely like a swimming pool (?). 
Taste was cola like. Caramel sweetness and bitterness from the roasted malts. Well hidden alcohol.
Mouthfeel was zesty with tingly carbonation. Medium to full density. Somewhat hot in the throat. 478 charactersCresant, Sep 04, 2008

3.12/5  rDev -30.2%look: 3 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3 | feel: 3 |  overall: 3330 ml. bottle poured into my new Duvel tulip.
A vigorous mahogany colored pour produced a short lived, mountainous 3 finger tan head that quickly collapsed to a bubbly 1/4" film & was finally reduced to a broken, soapy slick. The beer has the appearance of dirty brown pond water when back lit, revealing minute particles of sediment.
S ~ Sweet malts & (over) ripe dark fruit. Black cherries. Figs, plums, prunes, dates, raisins, with some sweet spices ~ maybe cinnamon, clove, allspice? A camouflaged note of cocoa or bakers chocolate with coffee & butter caramels. There is a mild essence of medicinal alcohol. Complex & somewhat difficult to separate clearly.
T ~ Primarily follows the nose. Banana & the aforementioned dark fruits. Sour yeast, with a hint of bubblegum, black licorice, toffee & vanilla bean. Spices both sharp & sweet. The big alcohol presence is well concealed in the mix. I noticed a dry, floral after taste that lingered at the back of my throat. A little edgey.
M/D ~ Softer & more carbonated than I anticipated or prefer. Slick, but a little watery. Not particularly full bodied. The carbonation diminishes the mouth feel (for me). The alcohol is briefly noted on the finish but not over powering by any means. A little hot on the swallow. This left me a little disappointed but not disgusted. 
For my money & from these Monks, I think I'll stick with the Rocherfort 8. 1,400 charactersTATTORSO, Aug 24, 2008

4.16/5  rDev -6.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Poured from the bottle into a wide mouth chalice style glass.
Very dark brown in the glass, showing just slight cloudiness when held to the light. A decent 2 fingers of foamy off-white head that had great retention. Lacing was beautiful.
Dark fruit, slight must, earthy, complex malts, and noticeable alcohol on the nose. Mysterious mix of aromas, but pleasant just the same.
The first good pull had a more subtle flavor profile than I expected, as if it had sat in the wood for a while. There was plenty of mild dark malt and something that gave me the sense of earthiness or peat. There were also light notes of dark fruit reminiscent perhaps of prunes. Carbonation was very fine and abundant, with a nice creamy texture. The linger is long and dry with noticeable alcohol warming. 
This is definitely a beauty. Full bodied and complex with almost a sherry like warming. Not for the faint of heart but if you like abbey traps, you'll probably love this one. 963 charactersSIRIUS2, Aug 21, 2008

The beer pours very lively in my Flat Earth snifter. Insanely vibrant carbonation. A dark, plum to brownish body with an ever present tannish head. It holds the carbonation and the head for a while. Very enticing, but I was able to wait 20 min before drinking to let it warm up. The aromas are very nice. Complex maltiness w/ plenty of fruits. Plums, raisens, and even a candy aroma. There is definite alcohol here. If the aroma of alcohol was so great, I'd give this a 5 on smell. The taste is immaculate. Plenty more of the plum and raisen fruitiness. There is great depth to the maltiness w/ some mild toffee flavors and a fruity, malty sweetness. I can't really tell if there are hops in this beer. This is exactly what I'd expect. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and the carbonation is lively on the tongue. 
Overall a definite top 10 beer. The flavors are so complex in this beer it makes it a treat. It is really quite sophisticated. For most, it wouldn't be considered a beer due to its complexity. For the beer geek it is bliss. 1,151 charactersbrewdoc75, Aug 20, 2008

Head retention is average and leaves behind an uneven lacing all around the glass. Sediment chunks float throughout and there's a dark swirly spot of something or the other in the middle of the head. Smells sweet with some licorice, chocolate and malts being most evident. A biscuity base is also evident. A panoply of chocolate, caramel and licorice candies light up the taste buds in the front with some grapes and apples in the middle all followed by some invigorating spice and hops. Mouth-feel is medium to full bodied and well carbonated while the alcohol is almost nondescript. This brew exudes quality, but there's a little something missing that keep it's from attaining godliness. 767 charactersstephens101, Aug 10, 2008

Just arrived at my local shop, this is the "freshest" 10 i've experienced...
Pours into a wide-mouth goblet, displaying a deep mahoghany brown tone. Foam remains for a good length of time. Fits the part of a Belgian Quad in the looks department. Minor lacing laps against the edges of the glass. 
Aroma is peppery, overripe banana, and mild spice. The combination reminds me of spoiled fruit. Not especially enticing.
Various flavors flash across the palate, at first the banana and pepper, mixed with clove. There is an earthy hop bitterness that follows any sweetness, which is only mildly perceptible. Alcohol is there, disguised as pepper. Not very nuanced though. 
Mouthfeel is effervescent, carried by the subtle bubbles present. If not for this, a fresh Rochefort 10 would slide towards being way too boozy. The alcohol precludes it's sessionability... 
An aged bottle is preferred for my tastes, and i'll rate one again in the future... 1,498 charactersemerge077, Aug 06, 2008

Not much foam and it doesn't really last. Lacing is not extraordinary. Smells of malt, caramelized sugar, alcohol, hops, and spices, along with a somewhat unappetizing fruit character that borders on rotten. Tastes quite malty up front, with plum-like esters, chocolate/toffee, spices, and some medicinal phenols. This is a fresh bottle, and the alcohol is quite brazen. Full bodied, but carbonation is a bit high. An interesting sipper, but certainly not very drinkable by nature, and easily the worst of the Rochefort beers. 620 charactersphilipquarles, Aug 04, 2008

Definitely sweet tasting. I knock it down on the smell category simply because there wasn't much to smell; with clear sinuses I picked up almost nothing. But beyond a doubt, what it lacks in aroma is more than made up in taste, this is a special beer, and has even brought the entire style--Belgian ale--up to one of my favorites. Absolutely worth it. The cost is high, but you won't regret the splurge. 506 charactersandrewm190, Aug 04, 2008
4.22/5  rDev -5.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5A-Poured into a oversized wine glass. This Belgian quad pours a dense, nutty brown color with an initial one finger, off-white head that too quickly dissipates, leaving a bit of lacing. However, a few swirls bring back the wonderful head.
S-One of my favorite aspects of Belgina beers - the aroma. This one doesn't disappoint. Profuse amounts of dark, dried fruits - fig, raisin, dates. Also a fair amount of bready yeast, sugary sweetness and finally a pungent alcohol aroma to finish it off.
T-Mostly the dark fruits to mirror the aroma. Some chocolately notes - very subtle. Hops are noticeable also but not until the end. And a nice warm alcohol finish.
M- A smooth and modestly carbonated mouthfeel. Not a dense and heavy as some quads I've had. Very nice balance on the tongue.
D-A wonderful Belgian quad - certainly deserving of it's ranking. Although it carries a high ABV, I wouldn't count that against it's drinkability. While not "sessionable" in the typical sense, this is definitely a quad that a person could have a couple of beers and really enjoy the experience of drinks one of the world's best beers. 1,122 charactersballenc, Aug 03, 2008

S: purple grape and fig, strong esters and alcohol. incredibly aromatic.
T: Rish maltiness flavor is very strong, alcohol comes through after the malt, figgy, smooth and incredibly balanced.
medium body fantastic drinkability. it's definitely a sipper though. there is a damn good reason this beer is in the top ten. 404 charactersnaterock, Aug 02, 2008
4.1/5  rDev -8.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Hmmm, I don't know where quite to begin with this one. Poured into a tulip glass a brownie batter brown with a nice, big creamed coffee head that left some nice lacing. The appearance of this thing was the last good thing about it. Smelled a bit grassy, sour, wafts of dirty feet, and all-around funky. Not like the sweet quadruple brews I'm used to. Taste was funktastic. Rotten fruit, stale malts, sourness in a not-so-good kind of way, a bit of bitterness. Not as bad as the smell, but to be completely honest, I made it through about half of the bottle and ran to the bathroom for a nice round of the Hershey squirts. This thing turned my stomach like no other. The mouthfeel wasn't all that bad, slightly creamy, and medium carbonation. The alcohol could be felt, a nice warming, but definitely heavy. I had to pour this out. Such a shame coming from such an expensive brew. 
Consumed in July of '08 with a best by date of 2013. It couldn't have gone bad, as the best by date was 5 years away, and it seemed capped properly as it gave a nice hiss when opened. Maybe it needed to age a little longer? Not sure, but it was awful. 
Probably the worst of the so-called "best" Belgians I've ever consumed. I probably would have liked it more if didn't make me sick. Not sure if I'll try this one again.
Old Scores: 4, 1.5, 2, 3, 2 with an overall 2.4

Updating this review. Let's see if another bottle gives me the shits
Pours a dark brown color with maybe some hints of crimson on the side, a decent tan colored head and good lacing. Cap sticks around. Wonderful aroma of chocolate, grass, caramel, dark fruits, and deliciously sweet. No hops. Taste is much better than I remember. Not as much weird earthy funkiness, but there's notes of apple skin, chocolate, plums, light raisin, and molasses. Yumm, this is much much better. This finish long with a yeast and minty herbal like quality on the back of the tongue. I can't even believe my old review. Mouthfeel is full but carbonation is a little high at first, but slowly mellows with some swirls. This bottle is about 2 years old, so it's holding up quite well. A very good beer and satisfied my recent desire for a quad. 2,184 charactersKeefD, Jul 30, 2008
3.86/5  rDev -13.6%look: 4 | smell: 3 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5A- Pours a coffee brown with about a finger of head, most of which disappears quickly. Nice lacing.
S- Chocolate and malt with a slight twinge of alcohol.
T- Lots of dark fruits after the carbonation gets out of the way. Finishes with some freshness from the hops.
M- Full-bodied. Sort of creamy after the carbonation/alcohol shock. Very interesting.
D- I'll have one any day, but not 2 with the 11.3 ABV. 409 charactersjmmakare, Jul 29, 2008

Its hard for me to review this beer cause im not sure i have the experiance yet to fully give it the review it deserves, All i can really say is that the complexities and balance on it are the best i have ever had. Very rich and smooth everything comes through with every drink you take. Perfect carbonation level and a very warming brew, i'll be setting 2 of these back for later and haopefully i'll be able to do a better review next time i have it 487 charactersSpecialK088, Jul 28, 2008

S-Excellent. Lots of dark fruit, a modest amount of alcohol and a brown sugary sweetness.
T-An outstanding complex flavor. Moderate sweetness with lots of raisin and a bit of bittersweet chocolate. A nice touch of alcohol warmth after the finish.
M-Creamy and delicious.
D-A very drinkable brew, admittedly one with a high ABV. Also a little too much residual sweetness lingers.
An outstanding brew, deserving of the rep and the hype. 511 characterssholland119, Jul 25, 2008

A- Pours a dark copper color with a sturdy head. The glass had more lacing than I've ever seen when it was empty
S- So much comes through but I guess the dominant scents are bananas, coffee, chocolate, cloves, and other spices. Further in the background are notes of vanilla and dark fruits.
T- Just as complex as the smell: Chocolate, clove, banana, vanilla, stone fruits (plums?), coffee, and a slight sweetness imparted by the alcohol. My only complaint is the slight estery flavor in the aftertaste.
M- A little richer than a typical belgian and nicely carbonated
D- Very drinkable in spite of the alcohol content...although with a beer this delicious and complex, who'd want to rush? 732 charactersJoeMayo, Jul 24, 2008

T-Roasted coffee and toffee, rich malts with a semi bitter aftertaste.
M-Light body, meduim carbonation. Pretty smooth on the palete
D-High ABV make for a one in a setting brew. 353 charactersZadok, Jul 23, 2008
4.15/5  rDev -7.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Great looking bottle. Classic. The beer itself has a great color. Nice and dark. It looks great in the chalice. I'd prefer a little more head on it, but other than that, the appearance is very pleasing.
I like the taste, but I felt a little more bite than some of the other top of the line belgians. It doesn't seem to hide the alcohol that well.
It is definitely a good beer, but I doubt I'd have more than one in a sitting. 425 charactersNorse23, Jul 21, 2008

4.58/5  rDev +2.5%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Bottle purchased from Once Upon a Vine in Richmond. Poured into a St. Bernardous chalice.
Appearance: A deep brown body with garnet overtones, a huge, immaculately beautiful head (tarnished only the bit of yeast I let escape from the bottle), and tons of gorgeous sheets of lacing that cascade down the sides of the glass as the liquid flows away from them. Marvelous.
Aroma: Tons of dark fruity esters - golden raisins, figs - sweet alcohol, and great roasted malts. Molasses and brown sugar are heavenly here. 
Taste: Let's see, how to break this down ... we'll start with the malts. Half-city coffee is noticeable, but so is buttery, caramelized toffee and the aforementioned brown sugar/molasses duo. Next up is the fruits - those same raisins and figs, and a few more complex though more faint esters. There's a citrusy twang in the finish, and a sweet, spicy, warming alcohol throughout. A very complex mouth.
Mouthfeel: Even softer than the Westy 12!? Impossible. I'll have to do a comparison tasting ... this one's divine, though, has that perfect "instant evaporation" feel, and is perfectly even once it puffs up in your mouth.
Drinkability: Well what's not to love about this one. A dangerously tasty and well-crafted beer, and well worth the ~$7.50 I paid for it. Alcohol is high but never harsh or chemically, and the sheer complexity of the beer makes every percentage point worth it. Highly recommended ... but I didn't need to tell anyone that, now did I? 1,476 charactersCrellMoset, Jul 20, 2008
4.8/5  rDev +7.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Bottle poured into a snifter.
Pours a dark, dark brown that looks a bit tea-like when held up to light. The head is big and rocky and dissipates fairly quickly leaving little lacing. The smell is hugely complex and dominated by dark fruits and spices - plums, grapes, cinnamon, pepper. The taste is much like the aroma but has a much bigger Belgian yeast flavor that then gives way to huge dark fruit flavors along with a bit of brown sugar and caramel. The mouthfeel is full bodied with big carbonation that dance over the tongue. This is one helluva well-crafted beer and extremely drinkable despite the ABV. Highly recommended! 631 charactersgford217, Jul 20, 2008

Smell is spicy, dark fruit, rich malty textures...one of the better examples of a beer where the smells become much more pronounced as it warms. Taste delivers on the dark fruit, I'm getting some fig, spicy alcohol, some molasses, somewhat nutty. Really creamy mouthfeel, great warming alcohol, lots of lingering spiciness. This is excellent. 531 characterscorey0212, Jul 20, 2008

Smells mildly of raisins, figs and tastes mildly of raisins, figs, plums, some cinnamon, but the whole thing was spoiled by a hint of vinegar. The flavors just aren't very strong, and the vinegar flavor ruined it for me. Doesn't compare with St B at all, nor with Westy. 326 charactersPhxHorn, Jul 19, 2008

S: Fruit, lots of it. Dark belgian candy sugar, belgian yeast, and did I mention dark fruits? 
T: Notes of plums, brown sugar, raisons, absolutely delicious. It doesn't get much better than this folks....
M: Creamy and smooth.
D: For the alcohol content, I could drink this stuff all night. I keep trying to cellar this beer but I'm unable to stop drinking up my stock. 547 charactersCoalCellar, Jul 13, 2008

Aroma was an abundance of burnt caramel, dried fruits and molasses. Taste is an absolute plethora of all good things you could imagine in a beer; caramel, toffee, maple, dried fruits, slight bitter chocolate, coffee, the could go on and on! The beer is full bodied, but not overpowering at all, actually very smooth. This is certainly one of those truly special beers that is worthy of the BA top ten, I'll definitely have this one again. 508 charactersatsprings, Jul 13, 2008
4.42/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5A- pretty dark, can't see through, although it looked a dark ruby while pouring into the glass. big fluffy tan on top which hadmedium retention without much lacing left behind, though it did clingto the glass as it fell. brown copper around the edge of the glass.
S- figs, raisins, a variety of more subtle dark fruits underneath. malty base, slightly sweet, hops aren't present. molasses. very nice. yeasty character finish instead of the light hops.
T- onslaught of light malts and slight spiciness along with loads of dark fruits, delicous all over. the fruit comes in waves where one flavor will pick up, then another ad almost infinitum, the longer you hold it in your mouth the more flavors you notice. yeasty finish, where the molasses plays a good role in keeping the yeasty dry finish from being too dry. 
M- surprisingly light body, but probably a medium body overall. what you would want and expect for the style.
D- great sipper, solid very enjoyed 964 charactersAtron67, Jul 12, 2008

Smells of toasted malts, nuts, and herbal hops. First sip is creamy, smooooth, complex - almost chewy. This beer blows my mind. It tastes strong as the 11.3% ABV is not hidden - it is in your face, yet it tastes kind of light and somehow this brew is so damn creamy. 351 charactersATLbeerDog, Jul 10, 2008

T - dark fruit, spice, caramel, hints of alcohol, malt and yeast seem the most obvious to me
M - smooth, delicious mouthfeel with some carbonation. Goes down quite well
D - a shame it's not a bit colder outside as the ABV is certainly a bit warming. Is this beer drinkable? It's Rochefort, so yes! A truly worldclass beer.

Lots of different flavors but everything works flawlessly. Some raisins and dark fruit. Some alcohol, yet finishes crisply and dryly. Still finishes sweetly too.

I honestly cannot think of one redeeming quality about this beer. It started off well. The appearance was a very nice copper color. The smell was awful. It smelled like rotten fruit and upon drinking it did not get any better. Very bitter and sour tasting. Not pleasant at all. By far the most disappointing beer I have ever had.

4.67/5  rDev +4.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5This bottle of goodness travelled all the way from southern Belgium, where it is brewed by one of the only Trappist Breweries in the world. Rochefort makes three Ales -- the 6, the 8, and the 10. I recently purchased a 10 at New Beer in Manhattan and aside from having sampled a large number of high powered Trappist ales in Antwerp over the summer, this is the most intense and amazing beer I've ever had, period. This is one of the few brews that I have had which are deserving of the "Life is Beautiful" tag. Whenever there's a beer that there's not much more to say about other than "if you haven't had this, you haven't had beer," I'll just tag it like that to keep it simple. Rochefort 10 is full of amazing flavor like dried fruits and other dark and mysterious things. There's a ton of alcohol at almost 11.5% ABV, and you can taste it. But it doesn't matter, because you're literally swimming in a full bodied, complex, ocean of a beer that is the very blueprint for hundreds of imitators. Seek Rochefort now and seek it often. Reviews of the 6 and 8 are forthcoming. 1,076 charactersbrewdogmrb, Jul 03, 2008

T - Spicy, warming alcohol kick greets you up front. Quickly fades into a spicy sweet dark fruit taste of plums and raisins.

A - Guinness-like, only with a better, rocky head and excellent lacing.
S - Raisins, caramel, banana, a touch of mocha and malt.
T/M - World class in every respect - outstanding. Very complex, especially as it warms. Dark fruits, cocoa powder, a touch of earth; light, supportive carbonation that pull it together perfectly. Wow! Soft creaminess that straddles density and being light without being either. "Balanced."
D - Very drinkable but given its ABV one would be quite limited. This isn't the type of ale to have out on the deck in summer heat, but it would be splendid pretty much any time, anywhere. 666 characterspinotboy007, Jun 29, 2008

Chocolate and dark fruit arrive midway. Finish is warming, almost like a brandy. Very complex beer. One that's perfect to sit with, enjoy and contemplate. 375 charactersWinter, Jun 28, 2008
4.38/5  rDev -2%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4It appears to be dark, dark brown on the pour, but there are red highlights if held up to the light. I was shocked by how much fizzy head gathered on top. The lacing was absolutely gorgeous, lasting throughout the drink, repeatedly coating the glass in new layers. There's a lot going on in the nose, with dark fruits leading the way. A definite note of alcohol too.
This is my 2nd time trying the brew, and I'm tasting the alcohol a lot more this time. In fact, that's the only thing keeping it from the five I gave it before the notebook was with me. There's a lot going on though, with the fruit and caramel tastes almost masking the alcohol. At this point, it tastes very good, but the Rochefort 10 that exists in my memory tastes slightly better, if that makes sense.
Creamy and sweet in the mouth, but with more carbonation than I expected. Still feels like a treat though. The ABV prevents me from downing several bottles, but boy, with that taste, I'd like to. 970 charactersLarrytown, Jun 22, 2008
4.49/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4A- Dark, hazy brown with a nice off-white head. I thought I was pretty careful on the pour, but some sediment got into the glass anyway.
S- Wow, intense and rich. Hugely malty, with a buttery richness akin to an old English barleywine. Dark fruits such as dates and raisins are evident, as well as a medicinal quality. Fantastic, complex stuff. 
T- A roasted quality comes through in the taste, with a touch of coffee and bittersweet chocolate in addition to the dark fruits. The familiar spicy and medicinal Belgian qualities come through as well, winding their way through the taste and ending up lingering on the finish. A touch of bitterness is apparent, but not much.
M- Smooth and velvety. It's full-bodied, and the carbonation is just strong enough to give it a good bite.
D- The alcohol is noticeable, but it's hidden well for its strength. I'd have another small bottle.
This is a fantastic beer, plain and simple. There is a reason this is rated so highly on this site. I may not be experienced enough in the tasting of fine ales to be able to appreciate all of this beer's many facets, but I know quality when I encounter it. This beer is of the highest quality. Perhaps not the best beer I've ever had, but it's definitely up there. If you have access to this and have not yet tried it, I suggest you do so immediately, if not sooner. Highly recommended. 1,371 charactersInsolublePancake, Jun 20, 2008

Appearance is a deep dark almost black shade of red with a huge off-white head. Flavor is great, but I had one about a year ago, and it was layers upon layers of complex flavor. Ever second, a new taste would push itself to the forefront and overwhelm your taste buds for a second, then another delectable taste would push its way through. This bottle is different. It's more straight forward and not that complex menagerie of flavors, but it still is a wonderful tasting beer. I was looking for the beer that I tasted so long ago, so I guess it disappointed me a little. Great Quad. 651 charactersdemitriustown, Jun 19, 2008

Dark brown body with absolutely ridiculous head retention. Slowly fades into chunky lacing.

4.01/5  rDev -10.3%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Pours a murky brown color with tons of fizzy head, a little patchy lacing, some sediment goodness floating around in my tulip.
Smell has a malty aroma, some banana and clove, some other spices that I can't make out, slight woodiness aspect along with some dark fruit, complex yet simple at the same time.
Taste is far too carbonated at first, like a cola, so I decided to let it sit for a while and warm up at the same time. Taste is dominated by the malt with loads of spice kicking in, slight alcohol warming sensation but overall it's quite well hidden, decent dark fruit presence, carbonation is still a bit high but more manageable with waiting. 652 charactersdeltatauhobbit, Jun 13, 2008

Deep, hazy ruby brown with a huge lid of rockin' light light brown fuzz.
I can't even believe all that the nose is throwin' at me. Bits of chocolate, planets full of orchards of fresh, sweet, dark fruits and pears, a years supply of bubblegum, and Belgian yeasty overtones.
Taste delivers all that and more; a light peppery spice and pleasant, warming, brandy attempt to wind it down, but a huge, soft, fluffy-fuzzy, ticklingly-tingly, carbonation just lift it right back up and leave me wanting more.
Absolutely outstanding. Now that I've tried it there is no way I will be able to see this beer without snatching it up and immediately drinking it. Cannot believe I waited as long as I did to try this. 801 charactersSlynger, Jun 11, 2008
4.62/5  rDev +3.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 0,33L bottle into a glass.
A: Dark, opaque hazel brown. I can't really see through it, but I can see tiny streams of bubbles rising up along the edges. Pours with a thick, creamy head that dissipates to leave impressive lacing.
S: Oh man, this is pretty intense. Nutty, malty, fruity complexity... I am kind of at a loss for words in terms of breaking this down into manageable units. I immediately identify raisins, apricots, figs, plums, and a woody, bark-ish scent. I could just sit around and smell this all day, but I suppose I should get to the business of drinking the thing.
T: The taste delivers the complexity promised by the smell. The initial hit is kind of vinegary, but it calms down into a cacophony of fruity/earthy flavors. Also some caramel in there. The slight hop tartness is balanced by a residual sweetness that lingers on the back of the palate.
M: Surprisingly clean given the ludicrous alcohol content. There is a bit of alcohol burn in the back of the throat, but it goes down silky smooth and strangely light.
D: This is some dangerous stuff. I could definitely put down a few of these with no problem - very enjoyable and very drinkable, especially for its style. 1,210 charactersjenitivecase, Jun 09, 2008
4.25/5  rDev -4.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Pours a dark brown with a large, out of control tan head. Almost a gusher. Excellant head retention with heavy lacing.
Aromas of brown sugar, figs, plums, and alcohol esters.
The taste is sweet, fruity, toffee like with alcohol warming on the finish. Complex flavor profile.
Medium body with a nicely matched carbonation gives a creamy mouthfeel that suits the style well.
A complex beer that is worthy of the praise it receives. The high ABV, cost, and availability lowers the drinkability. 495 charactersmorimech, Jun 08, 2008
4.75/5  rDev +6.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Bottle - 330ml purchased from Bottleworks in Seattle, WA
My 2nd time drinking a Rochefort 10...fantastic beer, from start to finish, better than St Bernardus Abt 12 IMO (UPDATE: and judging from the "Best of BA" looks like you all agree!)
A: very dark beer molasses in color with tones of orange. Very dense thick creme/tan head. Coolest lacing I've ever seen, layering the inside of the glass after each sip like the different layers of earth over the ages. Head stays till the very end. 
S: very sweet, caramely and toffee smell. some earthy and nutty essences...
T: Can't even tell this is alcohol, and it's rated 11.3% ABV!!! Incredible! This is even more smooth and easy to drink than St Bernardus Abt 12. This is a sweet, medium carbonated beer that just goes down crazy smooth. I detect dates, figs, maybe some dark fruits like plums. Nutty with very little spice mixed with mild hoppyness but true to quad style the sweet maltyness dominates the palette.
M: perfectly carbonated, perfect malting and sweetness. thick creamy head and a very easy drink. Makes my mouth feel like it was created just for this beer.
D: this is an extremely deceivingly high ABV quadrupel. As delicious as this is (5.0 taste) I'm giving it a 4.5 simply because it's so potent...I hate to do it, but as far as drinkability, there will be a limit. 1-330ml bottle and I'm already buzzing pretty good.
All in all this is an amazing beer, and probably my favorite quadrupel, maybe even more favorite beer period! HIGHLY recommended! 1,520 charactersjulian, Jun 05, 2008

11.2oz brown bottle
A: snifter. pours a deep, dark rich mahogany with some flaky sediment floating around. nice tan head on top with a good retention rate and a good amount of lacing.
S: nice fall fruit aromas, apples, figs, plums. some spices as well, mostly clove and nutmeg. some strong alcohol esters.
T: strong flavors all over this. plums, raisins, some bananas and tons of clove. only downside is that the high alcohol is really coming through in the flavor.
M: mild to high carbonation. medium to heavy body. very smooth though for 11%.
D: very nice trappist beer and belgian quadruple. Absolutely worth a try. 647 characterspaulthebeerguru, Jun 03, 2008
4.28/5  rDev -4.3%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Poured into a goblet. Beautiful burgundy brownish color with a huge creamy head that fades fairly quickly but leaves a good lace.
The aroma is very Belgian. Lots of candied fruit and sweetness. Plum, figs, raisins, and a little cotton candy. The taste is one of the most complex of the Trappists I've had. There are notes of different sweet dark fruits, light hop acidity, and a strong alcohol presence.
The mouthfeel is very silky and a little heavy. Drinkability is somewhat hindered by the sweetness and high alcohol content, but this really is a delicious beer.. 568 charactersdaythree16, Jun 02, 2008

4.28/5  rDev -4.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Purchased at Super Cellar Warehouse Liquors in Avon CT
Smell- strong blackberries and caramel aromas and a classic Belgian style scent that over powers the fruit. 
Taste- Caramel up front that doesn't quite over power the beer but gives this brown ale a nice feel. a little tart at finish but quite perfect. The high 11.3 alcohol is smothered by the sweet flavors. 
Mouth feel- straight down with no problem, very smooth with the alcohol hitting the back of your throat.
Drinkability- Prob take down 2 before moving onto to a something with more yeast to balance it out 573 characterssmitty2717, May 30, 2008
4.02/5  rDev -10.1%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Grabbed this one on the way home having read about it on BA yesterday. 
Appearance - Nice, strong deep-brown/black with three inches of head that is thick, but not pillowy. The head retreats after a few minutes, leaving a nice quarter inch.
Smell - Malty, with a hint of nut, and good bit of coffee. 
Taste - The anticipated bitterness of the coffee smell never materializes. Instead it's as smooth as silk with lots of depth. A light hop, with a little sweetness balanced nicely with the alcohol finish. 
Mouthfeel - Almost creamy. Very smooth, but not heavy. Reminds me of a nice Guinness straight from the source. 
Drinkability - Unexpectedly smooth. I could drink this year-round. For such a potent drink, I was surprised. Frankly, I'm glad I bought only one, because I feel like I could easily polish off a few too many. 
The color and smell led me to believe that this would be an entirely different beer than it was. Instead of a very malty, coffe-ish drink, it's incredibly smooth and creamy with lots of subtle flavor. 1,033 characterscallmescraps, May 30, 2008
4.53/5  rDev +1.3%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5It's been a while since I nabbed some new brews to sample. I've been on vacation for a while and, while my friends and I enjoyed some choice beer, we didn't veer into unchartered waters. All were very good selections--Unibroue, Bass, Hoegaarden, Leinenkugel Sunset Wheat, Ommegang (and also Three Philosophers), Oak Aged Yeti, Gonzo Imperial Porter--you get the idea. I was due for something new and fresh.
Trappistes Rochefort 10 fit the bill, and how. This beer won me over with the presentation--three fingers of tan froth atop a cloudy mahogany body. Dense lacing decorated the Ommegang glass--outstanding. The nose has plenty to like--chocolate, grape, cherry, and a hint of vanilla that emerges later in the taste. Speaking of which, the taste nears a top score with its complexity and prominent flavors. Grape appears first but becomes imbricated under chocolate, caramel, vanilla, and a hearty fruit accompaniment of banana and cherry. It's excellent, all around, and the vanilla finish is not unlike a sorbet on the palate.
As with all fine Belgians and especially the Trappists, mouthfeel is crucial. #10 is no slouch--amply carbonated, never letting down, robust. Were it not for the head slap that the 11.3% provides, this would be a 5 on the drinkability scale hands-down. On flavor and desirability, however, #10 takes the cake, an extremely delicious beer that, like its counterparts #6 and #8, brings complexity and originality. #10 is no letdown, reminding me why Trappistes Rochefort remains my favorite Belgian purveyor of fine beer. Tremendous. 1,566 charactersGehrig, May 27, 2008
2.67/5  rDev -40.3%look: 2.5 | smell: 3 | taste: 2.5 | feel: 3 |  overall: 2.5A- Poured nicely until the yeast splooged into the glass. I thought I was pouring the beer better then that. It was a bit of a turn off to the beer. Head is very loose and that of a typical Belgian beer. 
S- The smell is fruity with a strong smell of alcohol. 
T- The taste was less fruity and more like cured meat. Strong taste of soy sauce and almost salty. I am getting a small hint of dates, and grapes. But very small.
M- Fizzy and very carbonated in the mouth and going down. 
D- This is one that I'm not going to buy again. Perhaps I just got a crappy one, or it went bad. Drank right after purchase. I'm not one to pour a beer down the drain, but it is tempting. Then again I'm not one to waste beer, good or bad. I did prefer the Rochefort 8 more. This beer seems very one dimensional. I know I'm rating this beer pretty low, but I've had lots better quads then this. 880 charactersWetpaperbag, May 21, 2008

The head lasted for about 4 minutes untill it shrunk down to about an eight of an inch. Smell is great. Full of spices and alcohol and sweet dark fruit. Taste was equally as good. Has a sweet fruity start with some black licorice mixed in. Then it moves to a carmel malt and alcohol finish. Mouthfeel was exceptional on this beer. The head and carbonation have a lively feeling in the mouth. 446 charactersmeatmallet, May 21, 2008
3.68/5  rDev -17.7%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4330 ml bottle into a room temp goblet at Victoria Gastro Pub (MD)
A - Burgundy to brown, mostly brown. One finger head. Some floaties and sediment.
S - Slightly funky aroma at first, more mellow malty/grainy as it settled.
T - A harsh bite at first, reminded me of Chimay's overall astringentness, but then settled and became sticky sweet. The malt wasn't too roasty. Not a woody grain, but slight fruit hints (cherry?).
M/D - After that sharp first hit, it mellowed into a steady, very consistent sweetness, continuous throughout the sitting.
LOTS of sediment in my glass, not sure if that's part of the deal with this beer or not. Decently flavored but not all that complex (at least my pour). A good beer overall, but personally, and it might just be this tasting, but didn't really scream at me "I am an awesome quad, hear me roar!". 842 charactersUSCTrojanBrian, May 20, 2008

I guess I expected more from this beer. Decent aroma, fruity, with some unexpected bubblegum, better than most, but I like the Gouden Carolus Xmas more. Same comments for the taste. Very nice, easy to drink, but not very complex, I want more nose for the price of this one. Easily drinkable, hard to know it 11% abv, amazing for that!

It is hazy, particularly if you pour the thick sediment. It is a glowing brown, with multiple red highlights. A nice foamy off-white head holds for a very long time, leaving a nice lacing. 
Nice aroma, fruity, with some unexpected bubblegum and obviously, layers and layers of sweetish maltiness with some yeasty notes. 
Medium to full bodied, it is a little on the sweetish side, fruity and malty, along with some spiciness and a moderate alcohol warmth. Very good, but just not at the top of my preferred belgians. Have to age this at least a year, it will probably improve. 618 charactersbrdc, May 18, 2008

Very effervescent with a thick white head the remains constant throughout. Lacing is present all the way down the glass. Aroma is very complex with raisin, fig, brown sugar, and cooked fruit. The taste is reflective or aroma, the alcohol is present but not overwhelming it balances the sweet fruit flavors. The flavors linger on my tongue for minutes. A very intense and beautiful beer. The experience is amazing but it is most certainly a sipping beer. 537 characterstigerdoc, May 18, 2008
4.54/5  rDev +1.6%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Poured from 12 oz bottle into red wine glass.
A - Deep brown, opaque, with obvious yeast sediment. Small tan head that disappears rather quickly into almost nothing with no lacing; to be expected with this level of alcohol.
S - This beer smells like an elegant dessert. Bready aroma provides the backdrop for caramel and brown sugar, very predominant vanilla, and hints of almonds. Cocoa is lurking as well along with juicy dark fruits such as raisins, plums, black cherries, and currants. Faint banana esters surface through the phenolic quality of the alcohol.
T - Very sweet caramel malts and dark fruit early palate, and then a resonant wave of vanilla. Vanilla unfolds into nutmeg, mace, and something akin to fresh ginger, faint chocolate, and an elusive spicy hop presence. A little bitter near the finish with the alcohol unleashing it's full wrath with an undercurrent of bread and nuts. Caramel malt and warming alcohol linger for a few moments.
M - Very lightly carbonated, full bodied, and quite slick even with the high alcohol content. The alcohol is obviously there, but the astringency is well hidden.
D - A bit on the intense side, I couldn't see having more than one or two unless with a meal. The ABV itself makes it a little of a monster, and it's quite sweet as well.
I tried this Rochefort 10 for a couple of reasons; firstly I'm trying to branch out style wise, and I was also fortunate enough to find a bottle. I don't really have any experience with Trappist ales, aside from large amounts of Chimay blue label I was drinking last Christmas. A very fulfilling brew that I look forward to having in the future. 1,640 charactersPatrickJR, May 11, 2008
4.5/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured into a brandy snifter, this beer is a deep opaque mahogany brown, not quite motor oil dark but solidly brown. The head is the same tan of the bottle label and billows up a full inch. It is thick and creamy with a mix of large and small bubbles. Nice webbing and a constant quarter inch of head through out the life span of this beer.
Smell is of fruity rich malts. I get pear and roasted apple smells with a toasty malt that has toffee and caramel hints. A slight alcohol twinge but nothing that raises any red flags. Outstanding!
Taste has a warmth from the abv and a fruity maltiness. I taste more toasted malts then phenolics. There is also a rich toffee molasses flavor that compliments a medium bodied dark candy taste. Hops give way to a more yeasty dark bread flavor. Very complex and awesome.
Mouthfeel is super creamy and smooth. This one is dangerous at 11.3% because it is so easy to get down. This is one of the best Belgian Quadrupels I've ever had. I will buy this every time I see it in the store. Try it or I will find you!!!! 1,052 charactersjbphoto88, May 10, 2008
4.58/5  rDev +2.5%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a thick dark brown, with hints of deep orange overtones. The carbonation pops and sparkles away as the head develops and then settles a 1/2 inch layer of foam on the top of the liquid. The foam sticks to the sides, creating a wonderful lacing effect as the brew is drunk.
Sweet dark fruits. Preserved plum and figs. I love the smell of sweet fig. Raisins, and hints of cocoa.
Dark Fruits and a punch of alcohol. The alcohol warms through with each sip. It is a monstorous beer. Malt sweetness, rich, yet subtle honey flavours, ending with a strong medicinal quality and strong alcohol dryness.
As I said, it is a monstorous beer. I wouldn't say it's an effort to drink through, but there has to be a right mood. Amazing flavours, full carbonation, and heavy alcohol. It is still well rounded, and one of the best the world has to offer! 845 charactersLukie, May 10, 2008
4.28/5  rDev -4.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Pours a rich brown, with a medium tan head. The head is very smooth and the carbonation bubbles very small. Smell is of raisins, brown sugar, with a hint of alcohol. Taste is rather dry, though this is a malt oriented beer. It is also slightly spicy, with a bit of heat from the alcohol. There is a bit of oak like character to the beer, along with a slight amount of earthyness. The hop profile is very mild. Mouthfeel is rich, carbonation levels are quite smooth. For its alcohol content, this is a very drinkable beer, though for maximum enjoyment (and at $5.50 for a 11.2oz bottle) it is best enjoyed once per drinking session IMO. A fantastic trappist ale that I plan to buy again. 686 characterstronester, May 10, 2008

The numbers 090113 08:17 were on the bottle
Color: A dark nutty brown...no light was shining through when held up. A nice 2 finger creamy tan head.
Aroma was of malt, caramel a hint of plums and cinamon.
The first thing I tasted was sweet malts with cherries in the background. You can taste the alcohol but it doesn't overpower. There's a hint of apricots and vanilla right at the end....very faint. Great tasting.
A great creamy mouthfeel...like velvet in your mouth...just top notch.
I finally had a chance to buy one of these at the liquor store I frequent. A little pricey for one bottle but well worth it. I may go back and buy 2 or 3 to store.

S: Malts, some dark fruits and other sugars. A pleasant aroma.
T: The dark fruits and spices came through the most in the complex taste. The alcohol is pretty noticable, but what else could you expect with 11.30% ABV?
M: Typically lively Belgian mouthfeel. Lots of carbonation and smooth, dry finish. This is a very full-bodied beer.
D: While not my favorite example of a quadrupel (that would be St. Bernardus Abt 12), it is still a very tasty beer. 609 charactersavalon07, May 03, 2008

A- Poured into a Chimay chalice, this beer pours an opaque, dark reddish-brown color with a dirty white head that settles to a thick layer. The head sticks around for the duration of the beer, leaving barely any lacing on the glass, which was surprising. 
S- The aroma is full of malty sweetness that's supported by dark fruits, spicy Belgian yeast, maple syrup, burnt carmel, and substantial alcohol.
T- Sweet flavors of dark fruits and sugary malts abound with a fruity, yeasty finish. The alcohol is noticeable in the taste, and there is a slight burn as this goes down. 
M- A medium-bodied feel with mild carbonation. 
D- For 11.3% ABV, this is very drinkable; but the sweetness of the taste and the high ABV makes this a beer that is best enjoyed slowly, sip by sip. 
One of my favorite Belgian beers thus far. Highly recommended. 897 charactersTdizzle, Apr 26, 2008

The aroma is sweet, of dark ripe fruits and spicy with a slight medicinal alcohol smell. This reminds me of drinking whiskey. Very warming to the throat and mouth. The flavor isn't as deep and complex as i thought it was going to be. It mostly just tastes like dark ripe fruit and alcohol. It does taste better as it warms though but still mostly one dimensional.

Scents of dark fruit (fruit and plum), as well as candi sugar and some mild spiciness in the background. Flavors similar to nose; however somewhat of a medicinal quality detected.

Head/Lacing: With a slightly aggressive yet careful pour into a chimay chalice, a generous solid white 2-finger head developed. After about two min. the foam was gone and a nice even creamy lacing was left all around the glass.
Appearance: Nice brownish dark red in color, with a decent liquid to foam separation.
Smell/Taste: Smells like warm sweet feed mixed with caramel and raisins, very complex and hard to put your finger or, i guess; nose on. Taste is very complex as well, raisins, cream, caramel, and wonderful malt and hops are the flavors i detect. Also has nice warming finish on the first few sips.

4.05/5  rDev -9.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Emptied bottle into an oversized wine glass creating over a fingers worth of light brown head. Through the glass it looked a dark chocolate brown color. First whiff I got had mellow alcohol and sweet scents to it. Decent taste, slightly sweet with lots of subtle flavors that were hard to pick out but vanilla and black licorice were two of the ones that I could detect. Very easy to drink feels very smooth on the tongue. The only thing I didn't like was halfway thru the flavors turned into medicine like cough syrup. Tasty drink but I was expecting something more from such a high rated beer and was a little disappointed. 625 characterskurtissellen, Apr 16, 2008
4.38/5  rDev -2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Appearance: It's dark brown in color with a hint of orange around the edges. Chunks of sediment can be seen sporadically as they approach the glass. Even with a slow pour, the head is an impressive two fingers deep and very slow to disappear. Nice, thick web of lace remains.
Smell: No doubt the smell is very nice, but it falls a little short of top notch. It's just a tad weak. There are spicy elements (mostly clove) that mix well with plum and raisin scents. Caramel and sugary malts are certainly present and sweet. Very light chocolate aroma finally emerges.
Taste: This is easily where it shines. Dark fruit and caramel malt flavors predominate and give it an excellent flavor. Clove and pepper spices give it some kick and really drive this beer to the next level. Alcohol is masked well, but is slightly noticeable. Definitely has a warming element to it. Finishes sweet and dry.
Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light to medium bodied with very solid carbonation. At 11.3%, this one is damn smooth and easy to drink. I'd happily take down 2 or 3 if I had them available. This is an excellent beer. No doubt about it. Certainly a "can't miss" for Beer Advocates. 1,170 charactersprototypic, Apr 09, 2008
4.35/5  rDev -2.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Rochefort 10 pours very dark and nearly black save for ruby red highlights along the edges of my glass. It is a very dark and brooding quadrupel. The head is voluminous and has an odd greyish tan color. Despite the high alcohol content this quad maintains its head and leaves a thick coating of foam on the walls of my Chimay goblet.
The scent is masterful and dominated by dark fruits (raisin and plum) dipped in rum. The fruit and rum mixes well with a dash of molasses. To balance this sweetness there is a spice and yeast character.
The fruit flavors are truly astounding to taste and also contain a lighter berry flavor. Paired with the rum and spice finish the flavor is very deep and complex. 
The carbonation is too strong for my tastes especially at the start of my glass, but later resolves to a more satisfying level. Overall there is a very full bodied feel on the tongue. The carbonation is somewhat off in my tastes and serves the beer satisfactorily, but fails to compel it to greater heights that I've enjoyed in other Belgians. I'd love to have cases of this on hand, but the price would be difficult to swallow. Altogether an amazing beer that must be tried at least once and preferably several times! 1,222 charactersJmamay22, Apr 09, 2008

The aroma is of dark smoky malts, dried fruits, and alcohol. The flavor is heavy and robust. Woody, smoky, burnt malt, leather and earthy flavors stand out. These flavors cover up some date, fig and prune notes. The alcohol is warming and lets you know its there and that this is a strong beer, with strong flavor and 11.3% abv. The palate is full, with a dry earthy finish. 445 charactersgenerallee, Apr 08, 2008

A- the 10 pours a nice deep murky brown color with a finger of quickly dissipating tan head leaving a nice rim of sticky lacing.
S- Almost minty, a very spicy nose, full of malts and pure trappist glory!
T- Very malty, deep fruits that lead to a nice slight bitterness, pleasant warming alcohol.
M- a bit crisp but meaty and pretty thick, the carbonation likes to gather upon the tongue and really caress the rest of the mouth with great flavor.
D- It is a bit filling, and definitely a sipper, one would want to savor every drop of a 10.
R- Classic. It gets better everytime. 677 charactersATPete, Apr 08, 2008
4.53/5  rDev +1.3%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 330 ml bottle.
A - Pours a dark mud brown, impenetrable to light, with a solid 1 inch head that dissapates quickly leaving a tan, sticky lacing.
S - First off is a hit of ripe fruits (banana and melon come to mind), mixed with spicy hints of dark fruit (raisin), brown sugars/molasses, alcohol, and a very slight hint of typical malt aroma.
T - Firstly, the alcohol and carbonation combine with a peppery start for a subtle kick, followed by a sweet rush of molasses combine with the dark fruits while the alcohol is residing in the background from right after the start until the end.
MF - Smooth and medium-bodied with a nice mix of carbonation.
D - Hell, if this brew wasn't 11.3% abv, I would be on my fourth sample by now. Summed up: Highly drinkable taste-wise. I could drink this all the time, it is a damn fine crafted brew. However, the high abv leaves you sampling a lower amount than normal.
Notes: At first, I was skeptical with all the hype built up around this, however, it is well justified. This is a beer that was crafted with the finest of care and it shows. I thought the Trappistes Rochefort 8 was pretty good, but this one wins between the two, hands down. 1,197 charactersMazeraski, Apr 06, 2008
4.2/5  rDev -6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured from a 375 ml bottle into the appropriate Rochefort chalice. Bottle marked "10/01/11".
A: Pours a dark murky brown with a thin spider webbed head.
S: Some dark fruits, brown sugar, and a heck of a lot of alcohol.
T: All the complexity and wonderful flavors of the 8 with a big dose of alcohol at the end. It was almost like taking a shot with each sip. I felt that this took away from the beer in some way. The flavors felt at the beginning are brown sugar, molasses, and some thick dark malts.
M: Smooth with low carbonation.
D: Definitely a sipper and one to drink at the end of the night. 603 characterswilljschmidt, Apr 04, 2008
4.4/5  rDev -1.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Pours a cloudy deep dark brown with over an inch of thick cream colored head. Long lasting retention with great silky lacing. Smells of dark fruits like raisins and cherry, molasses, bread, and alcohol. Reminds me of Rum Raisin. Taste is interesting and constantly changing, picking up spiced fruits like apples and bananas, a molasses/toffee backbone, some cocoa, dark fruits like raisins, prunes, and cherries, and the warmth of alcohol. Smooth and creamy with a nice carbonation that really only pops up in the finish along with the 11.3% alcohol it's packing. Definitely a sipping beer. Took me a few sips to grow accustomed to it, but I'll definitely pick more of this up for special occasions. Very flavorful with lots of different things coming out with every sip. 771 charactersHopDerek, Apr 04, 2008
4/5  rDev -10.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4This beer is very good. It poured a deep golden color into my goblet glass with a good head about 2 fingers thick. The smell is very raisin-ey and plummy and sweet. 
It definitely holds up with St Bernardus and Westy12, but has more alcohol in the mouthfeel with frothy carbonation. I think this beer will be outstanding when stored properly for at least a year or longer. 373 charactersbgramer, Apr 03, 2008
4.6/5  rDev +2.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4While in Belgium during a trip last year I discovered Rochefort and decided to bring back a bottle of the 10 (among a few others). I got some good news today so I decided to pop the bottle in celebration. This one has aged for about a year and poured into my chimay chalice a nice deep brown with a touch of ruby around the edges. The head rose to about 2 1/2 inches then slowly dropped to a solid layer of tight foam that covers the top. The smell is rich boozy raisins and other fruits giving great promise. The taste is rich with chocolaty notes along with sweet dark fruits. There is a very familiar flavor here that I cannot put my finger on but it is fantastic all around. Alcohol is present only in the background and as a slight warming at the end. The mouthfeel is smooth and lush, precisely what I would want in a beer that is extraordinarily complex and delicious. When I was in Belgium I drank a lot of the 8's and several 10's and I have to say that Rochefort is my favorite beer. There is something new to discover in every sip. 1,042 charactersGodot, Apr 02, 2008
4.52/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Sampled from a 330ml bottle purchased at Nikkis's in North Providence, RI.
A deep brown color with a moderate head that shrinks pretty quickly but remains fed by the constant rise of bubbles. It has a rich aroma with lots of brown sugar. The flavor is strong and rich but incredibly smooth. It has elements of brown sugar, raisins, dates and dried fruit. There's a slight sweetness and a nice warming sensation. The high carbonation lighten the mouthfeel but at the same time it's thick and substantial.
This is a very interesting beer with great depth and drinkability. 572 charactersGJ40, Mar 29, 2008

It had a well balanced flavor of cherry and hops and malt, creating an overall dark and complex flavor that lasted for a while. It was nicely thick and smooth with slight carbonation and slight alcohol warming. This is what I was hoping for from the Trappist monks. Overall it was powerful and delicious. 420 charactersPencible, Mar 29, 2008

s - dark fruits, plum, sweet, maybe a little caramel
t - dark fruit, yeast, caramel, alcohol. Starts off sweet and stays pretty sweet thoughout. Not much of a bite, but a slight spicy twang. Alcohol warmth sets in after a while. 
m - pretty carbonated and bubbly. 
d - I think I need to find out how to store beers for long periods of time properly. This one aged almost a year, but I am not too impressed. I was expecting this to be much more then it was. I will have to give this another shot. 665 charactersthirtysixbelow, Mar 26, 2008

A-Opaque reddish brown with a one-finger firm head diminishing quickly to a very thin blanket that lasted for a long time.
S-Malty Rum Raisin with a slight hint of cloves.
T-Raisins, plums (prune), and rum. As the beer warmed over a period of 15 minutes the taste evolved into one of wonderful smokey-bananas, with a slight yeasty malt finish.
M-Smooth and silky with a lot of carbonation.
D-Very enjoyable by itself,...for some reason this one took longer for me to drink.

S - raisin, pumpernikel, pepper, a teensy bit musty/woodsy. Surprisingly faint.
T - really having trouble pinning down the flavors here, they're so thoroughly blended. I'm getting caramel, banana, clove, prune, and strong alcohol in the finish. As it warms, some apple opens up, but so does more bitterness and fusel flavoring. 
M - silky, yet with aggressive carbonation. Pretty much standard thick-but-effervescent thing I'm noticing as I make my way through the Trappists. Can't fault the beer in this dept. 
D - I like plenty of boozy beers, but the aftertaste on this is dragging it down for me. Just a bit too hot. Overall not bad, but there's nothing wowing me in the flavor profile to make me want to lay a few down to quell the heat. It's been a bit since I've had it but I think i prefer the St. Bernardus 12 944 charactersgrandq, Mar 16, 2008

A - Dark, thoughtful opaque brew with a thick, brown head of froth. Swirling it around it loses no head and sticks to the side of the glass. Elegant to say the least.
S - Rich, complex aroma of dark fruits, mostly plums and raisins. No hop tinge or alcohol is present in the nose.
T - Sweet yeasty body with a full malt backing. All the nice fruit notes come through and although the abv isn't really present in the taste profile, you can tell it's there due to the warming effects. Very tasty.
M - Full bodied, medium carbonation, dry finish with the slightest hint of alcohol in the aftertaste.
D - For it's potency, this is an amazingly easy brew to consume. Simply outstanding, stop reading these reviews and go try one! 756 charactersPhageLab, Mar 13, 2008
4.84/5  rDev +8.3%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Upon opening, the beer foamed uncontrollably and zoomed out of the bottle. Very strange and scary, as invariably some beer was wasted. Hope it's not a portent of things to come. Anyway, poured into a goblet.
A: pours a cloudy reddish brown, settles in the glass to a dark cloudy brown, good sized head (when it finally went down), decent lacing
S: banana, spicy grape, clove, warming alcohol, overripe strawberry, subtle but complex
T: spiced banana again, overripe dark fruit in the middle, mixed with some caramel, creamy finish right at the end, alcohol only evident in the fumes coming up into my nose from the aftertaste
M: like most good Belgians, not overly heavy, but still rich and deep, understated carbonation
D: as others have said, very much like the "8", but stronger and deeper, almost more of an earthy quality, the Rocheforts are still the best Belgians I have had in my opinion 900 characterspheggeseth, Mar 12, 2008
4.77/5  rDev +6.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5A - it is opaque in my wide snifter, but was quite red during the pour. Dense creamy head. Lace is good, but not outstanding.
S - Deep, deep notes of rum raisin, heavenly spice notes, and dark lucious boozy malt
T - absolutely smothered by rich, dark fruity malt, which finally gives way to a smooth chocolate finish.
M - tons of alcohol makes for a drying finish, but is otherwise subtle for the most part (well, as subtle as 11.3% can be). Not overly carbed like some Belgians, which is fine by me. It's got more body than your typical Belgian, but no one said this was typical... yet it is still highly digestable for a beer of it's size.
D - Everytime I crack a bottle of this, I am reminded of the Dave Barry quote, "beer is proof that God loves us and wants to see us happy."
An all-time favourite, it never fails to satisfy and amaze me. Incredibly drinkable for such a big beer, I don't have to take my time with this one quite like I do with say a Samichlaus or Expedition Stout. Delicious. 1,004 charactersmarkaberrant, Mar 12, 2008

The smell is good, yeasty mixed with dark roasty malt. A nice chocolate note along with some alcohol.
The taste is good but not outstanding, I like it plenty just not as much as the rest of the world. The dark fruit and roastyness is very good. The alcohol also makes it very warming.
The mouthfeel is very good, nice body, very creamy as is warms, and good carbonation.
The drinkability is good, at this price there are many other brews I would rather drink however.

Exceptional dark-brown color with a filmy tan head. Nice aroma of figs and other candied fruits, with a bit of caramel and spices. Lovely taste of dark fruits (and maybe some banana), spices with just the right amount of sweetness. Light bit of carbonation. Medium-bodied and very smooth. A very relaxing and enjoyable drinking experience.

This is an 11.2 oz/330 cl bottle poured to a small goblet. Label shows 'L290812', which I assume means this it's 'good' until sometime in late August, 2012...
A: Fantastic look; deep, deep ruddy brown crowned with an immobile finger's-worth of sandy tan head. That thing is nearly a 'solid' and crackles noisily as it drops, ever-so-slowly, and is densely packed with the creamiest and tiniest of carbonation. There could not be a more 'perfect'-looking quadrupel than this one, in my opinion...
S: Aroma of rich leather, strong honey (maybe mead?), candied fruits (plums, figs, raisins) and chocolate syrup. Tingle of alcohol booze. Not necessarily strong, but gently full of spicy yeast and plenty of toasty malt.
T: A little cocoa, a liberal dose of spice, enough reduced caramel and some zesty fruit, with more bitter rind. The finish is dry, full of dark fruit, chocolate and some savory elements, like leather or cured & peppered beef jerky.
M: Incredibly smooth, satin-like really. A little carbonation prickle; ok, quite a bit (but it's not that cola-like 'crackle'). Medium-full mouthfeel; not sticky in the finish, but a little sneaky with it's alcoholic warmth.
D: One of my favorite Belgian beers of any style. It's been quite a while since I've tried this one, and at $6-7/bottle it's not cheap (oh, how I lament seeing those 4-packs in Belgium for under 4); but it's remarkably good and certainly 'easy to drink'. At any cost, it's a world-class beer worth seeking out. 1,617 charactersmsubulldog25, Mar 06, 2008

In addition, there were some deep brown yeasties that I had disturbed at the end of the pour. Instead of sinking down, it sat atop the stiff meringue head like a brown crown. 
Dark ripe fruit. Honey and spicy desert bread. Liquor phenol alcohol in the nose too, but its very smooth and herbal, not astringent.
Peppery spice. Stong alcohol warming. Malty with an interesting fruity bitterness. Alcohol really warms the body as this beer warms itself up. Very satisfying, but not over the top. 
I really enjoy this one. First of all, the label is no-nonsense. It doesn't even tell you what style (this ones a quad) it is. I love it.
It's below freezing outside, and this beer really hits the spot! A very well balanced and amazingly tasty beer. 811 charactersSurlyDuff, Mar 03, 2008

S - Sweet caramel aromas dominate. I could detect some bitter fruit and alcohol in the background. There is also some spiciness in there as well. Could be allspice.
T - Sweet caramel is also primary in taste. The spice comes through more in the flavor and is peppery and sharp. That gets balanced by a fruity citrus flavor. Alcohol is present throughout but really does not show any real strength until the aftertaste.
M - Medium to full bodied. Very good carbonation. Very warm finish.
D - Drinkability is good. The beer is complex and plays the part of the sipping beer very well. 739 characterscsmiley, Mar 03, 2008

4.45/5  rDev -0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Appearance: This one pours a murky brown color topped briefly by a little more than a finger of a foamy tan head.
Smell: The nose has notes of syrah, roasted malts, maple syrup, plumb, fig, clove, cinnamon, and Belgian yeast. 
Taste: Sweet caramel malts, brown sugar, and cinnamon kickoff the flavor profile. Roasty malts come in as the beer settles in the mid-palate. It's as if the beer fairy swooped in and spilled two ounces of porter in my quadrupel. Plumb, raisin, fig, and apple take over for the roasted malts before phenols, Belgian yeast, and clove swoop in, joining sweet caramel malts and spiced rum for the finish. I'm on the fence between 4.5 and 5.0.
Mouthfeel: This is medium-bodied and smooth with a sticky, lingering aftertaste. No shortage of carbonation in here. 
Drinkability: This is a fantastic quad and it's uniquely roasty for the style without deviating too far from the style guidelines. Quaffability suffers as the alcohol becomes very noticeable at the finish as the beer warms, but it does contributed positive characteristics to the taste. Fantastic beer overall. Well worth a try. 1,116 charactersgoschool, Mar 01, 2008

A-Poured a deep brown, forming a thick beige 2-finger head that left light lacing. 
S-Fig and raisin w/other lighter fruits and berries, dates, tobacco, light cocoa, toffee, very faint hops, grapes, spice, and toasty biscuit. There is also a warming alcohol wafting off. 
T-Upfront, it is toasty w/dried fruit and wildberry; dates, chocolate, and spice shine through at midpalate, and the slight hop bitterness balances the finish out w/warm, chocolaty alcohol that reemerges. 
M-The balanced, creamy smoothness is top-notch, and the carbonation is just right. Every sip makes you feel good.
D-Amazingly smooth, and delicious. I'd like to try aging a few bottles to see the result. 815 charactersBoitSansSoif, Feb 28, 2008

Aroma is of chocolate and dark, sweet fruits, with a bit of alcohol. Extremely nice aroma.
Taste is of sweet malts, toffee and a slight bit of chocolate. The alcohol is hot, and comes through at the end with a little kick int he back of the throat. A little age would probably tone that down.
Mouthfeel is excellent. Very creamy and smooth.
The alcohol burn is a bit much right now. The bottle is only about 4 months old. Toned down this would be much more drinkable. As it stands now, it's a very good beer. I'll have to grab a few more and hang onto them for a few years to see what happens. 620 charactersmbrandon2w, Feb 25, 2008

A - A small amount of head peaks up from the dark body, and shows good retention. No complaints.
S - Very fruit forward, cherry tartness, plum, grape and other dark fruits. Yogurt like lactic notes mix in with hints of funk. Also picking up a lot of vanilla. Alcohol is there, but not very assertive for an 11.3% beer. Truely beautiful.
T - A lot of backbone to this beer. Compared to other quads I've tried (Alpha Kong, Konigshoven, Three Philosophers, St. Bernardus 12) this seems to take a drier quality from the alcohol and hops, leading to a more complex and structured beer. Enters tart and fruity, lots of cherry, strawberry, and apple. Also noted a sweeter plum quality that seemed to linger, and grow stronger in the finish. The dry backbone takes over in the finish, along with a quality that reminds me of some of the drier bourbons I've enjoyed. This really is a beautiful beer.
M - Crisp, not to heavy, what one expects from a Belgian Trappist brew.
D - This is a wonderful treat. I remember once seeing a table a Hopleaf where three guys were ordering round after round of this beer. At $10 a bottle I was shocked, and after drinking it I still can't say I would do it, but I do have to say it would be hard for too many other beers to compete with this balanced and complex offering. 1,458 charactersSammyDavisJrJrJr, Feb 24, 2008
3.19/5  rDev -28.6%look: 4 | smell: 2.5 | taste: 3 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Dark mahagony brown and opaque. Two finger, pillowy, off white head in my Czechvar glass. Little to no carbonation. Good head retention.
The nose is musty and earthy. Not particularly pleasant. It mellows as it warms with a whiff of gouda cheese. Taste is anice from black licorice and slightly peppery. Alcohol becomes evident in the finish. One of the highest ranked beers in BA, yet I question why. Not sure why the disconnect, but the brew is too uninspired for my taste. 475 charactersjim102864, Feb 24, 2008
4.12/5  rDev -7.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4330 ml bottle into a tulip glass
A: Hazy dark brown body. Two finger tan head that stuck for a little while before disappearing to a cloud.
S: Rich, full aroma with dark fruits, caramel malt, and a touch of alcohol.
T: Alcohol bites the tongue immediately, interfering with a powerful and delicious combination of malt, sugar, ripe dark fruit, and a touch of spice.
M: Medium-full body with above average carbonation, cutting into the smoothness. Warming throughout, with some alcohol burn (after it warmed a bit) at the sweet, tasty finish.
D: With all that flavor it's a sipper with or without the 11.3% abv. It's a damn fine sipper - but the alcohol is a bit much for me, which, I suppose, is why I prefer the 8 (which is one of my favorites). 751 charactersOKCNittany, Feb 24, 2008
4.45/5  rDev -0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 411.2 ounce bottle purchased from the Beverages and More location in Mira Loma, last one there and have not seen many since they supposedly stopped importing them here, for about seven dollars, split with my roommate tonight, poured into my Three Philosophers glass
A-Deep dark brown with a red tint, 3/4 inch off white head that did not settle for five minutes, then left a nice soft pillow in the middle of the glass, nice retention, great lacing
S-Brown sugar, Belgian yeast, variety of malts, maple syrup, different dark fruits, sweetness, booze, ginger, grapes, cinnamon, caramel, raisins, and most of all spices
T-Reminded me of Westy immediately, just missing the strong malt backbone, this one had more spices going on though, big ginger and coriander tastes from the very beginning, did not have much taste while cold so I let it sit another twenty minutes before my next sip, then sweet flavors of prunes and raisins came with some sweet caramel and strong spice in the finish, this beer will probably age wonderfully
M-Medium plus body, creamy mouthfeel, sweet at times with cherries and plums, taste lingered longer than any other Belgian I have ever tasted, thickness was deceiving, also pleasantly spicy
D-Could have drank a few bottles of this stuff because the alcohol is hidden pretty well, but then I would have immediately had to have gone to bed because it is over eleven percent, smooth, just a high ABV
Been holding onto this bottle for a little while and finally decided to pop it tonight, tasted a lot like a Westvleteren 12 and definitely much cheaper for us in the states, plan on aging other bottles for a significant amount of time, one of the best quadrupels I have ever tasted, plan on drinking the 6 and 8 soon to compare them to the other trappist beers, but this one measured up nicely, definitely deserves to be in the top twenty beers on this site, recommended 1,900 charactersFloydster, Feb 23, 2008

Pours black with with a deep red tint to it. The head is a 2 finger+ that lingers for a very long time and leaves a lot of lacing on the glass. It is frothy and beautiful. The aroma is of sweet cherries, dark fruits, alcohol, and malt. I smell no hops. The taste is very well balanced and very complex. The initial taste has a lot of sweet malt and lots of alcohol. The alcohol continues to play on my tongue while the a slight hop bitterness balances the sweetness nicely. The grape/cherry flavor is in the finish and is very sweet. The mouthfeel is excellent and the beer is very well carbonated. The beer is pretty damn drinkable for the high abv. 682 charactersHopHead84, Feb 23, 2008
4.92/5  rDev +10.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5This, my friends, is true craftsmanship. I'm still on the new side of Trappist Ales (I'm well versed in their history - Thanks, Mr. Jackson - but this is only my second tasting of the fruit of the Trappist breweries' labor.
Appearance: Deep copper/light brown hue under a three finger rocky off-white head.
Smell: Lots of complexity...fruity esters and lots of malt, along with the hops and the alcohol is definitely present...balanced ridiculously well.
Taste: To quote myself, "...balanced ridiculously well." Delicious toasted malt flavor, balanced with fruit that I couldn't completely pick out, other than plum and maybe a little grape. There were probably 5 other fruits present as well, somewhere in there. The hops added a welcome bitterness and the alcohol fumed all up in there. (It's a strong beer, folks.)
Mouthfeel: Such a full body on this beer. It's classified as a quadrupel, and to that, I'll agree. It's malty as all get-out. The alcohol warmed me up all the way from the tip of my tongue down my throat, and the hops only enhanced the grown-up nature of this Trappist ale. 
Drinkability: It's the fullest-bodied Trappist I've had thus far. And it's absolutely delicious. It's worth every bit of the $8/bottle, so sip slowly and savor. I love Belgium. 1,274 charactersAleDrinkToThat, Feb 22, 2008

Medium mouthfeel, creamy, and sharply carbonated.

The head receeded to a nice ring on the edge by the time I sat down to admire my beer. The beer had an aroma of toasted malt and caramel. The taste is malty sweet but hoppy and well balanced. The body is full of carbonation and the taste is slightly hot with alcohol but this is a very well balanced and full bodied beer that lives up to its billing. 441 charactersggaughan, Feb 20, 2008
4.38/5  rDev -2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours like a good root beer - 2-finger frothy, velvety head with nice lacing. Good carbonation. Not so thick it's opaque, rather a little translucent.
Spice profile is surprisingly subtle - needs to warm/open up. Mellow molasses aroma mixes with yeast & malt. Some ginger emerges.
Everything on the nose comes out in a well-balanced, mellow package - a little ginger, hearty yeast and malt without any bitter taste or comforting stuff. Extremely well-balanced - like a warm blanket on a camping trip.
Feels like soothing ginger beer with very mild carbonation. Delightful, relaxing mouthfeel.
This is wonderful, easy-drinking stuff that's not too heavy for the style. Incredible quadrupel! 693 charactersIBUnit63, Feb 18, 2008
4.38/5  rDev -2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5After a long absence in this market I finally saw some more of this stuff, with a best before date of 10/14/12 which i assume means it was bottled in October of 2007. Pours a nearly opaque mahogany with a thick cola head. The aroma has some intense dark fruit notes upfront, along with some candied sugar sweetness, bread like yeastiness, some spices (corriander, cardamom, anise), and a touch of alcohol. The flavor is similar to the aroma, with a big dark fruit (plum, grape, fig, blackberry) presence upfront, along with a burnt bread flavor, some spiciness (corriander and anise), a slight hint of floral hops, and a nice alcohol presence that isnt overwhelming. The mouthfeel is smooth with moderate carbonation and drinkability is excellent for the style. Overall an excellent quad, drinkable and complex...hopefully this one isnt as scarce around here in the future. 873 characterssilver0rlead, Feb 18, 2008

Spicy aroma with notes of cinnamon and ginger. Plum and raisin notes in background.
Complex, dense flavor with notes of cinnamon, ginger, chocolate, toasted malt, raisin and plum. Red wine-like esters became apparent as temperature increased. Warm finish with lingering bitterness from alcohol, phenolic (spicy) notes and hops.
Effervescent, creamy mouthfeel from ample carbonation gave a ligher mouthfeel to the medium-full body.
Excellent beer. 515 charactersojclark, Feb 17, 2008

Big powerful aroma. Dark fruit, and dark bread jump out. Yeasty, with a nose full of alcohol. A whif of spices in the background. Nice complexity in the nose.
Dark fruit and caramel up front. Lots of yeasty, and spicy notes. Some warming alcohol. Finishes pretty dry, but flavors linger forever.

4.44/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 433cl bottle poured into a snifter. Thanks to the MLCC for forgoing their usual government pigheadedness and getting one of the ultimates in.
Pours a rather thick, nearly opaque black, and even off a gentle pour ends up with about 1 inch of head that recedes slowly and retains a little lacing. Carbonation appears to be fairly zippy, as befits the style. Big raisiny aroma meets the nose, comingling with a massive alcoholic whoosh that goes straight to the brain. Roasted malts, hints of chocolate and coffee. Ripe plums and apples, vanilla, molasses, warm bready yeast, pepper, spices. Good God this is complex stuff, wow... brilliant.
First thing you notice, on first sip, is the booziness. Then the flavours start to happen, and they're pretty amazing. The alcoholic warmth comingles nicely with the bready malt and is comforting, then the sweeter fruity flavours start to happen: the plums and raisins and other dried fruits. Vanilla, anise, a little clove, black pepper and chocolate. Cocoa bitterness, earthy hops. So bloody complex. Mouthfeel is surprisingly light for a beer of this strength, and the carbonation is pretty zippy, which proabably explains the lighter feel to it. It slides down surprisingly easy, but you feel every sip, so you are aware of the danger. I want to see how this ages, my only complaint is that it still seems a bit hot. Exceptional brew, enough said.
After 1 year: pours with lots of vigour and carbonation, looks about the same. The aroma hits you with the vanilla more pronounced than before, and the dusty cocoa bitterness coming out more as well. The licorice is REALLY coming out in the flavour, deep and herbal. More brilliant than even half a year ago. 1,701 characterstrevorwideman, Feb 16, 2008

4.24/5  rDev -5.1%look: 5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 411.2 oz bottle that had a loud hiss when the cap was cracked. There was even a small spritz that escaped as the cap was removed. Poured into a chalice, a thick tan head creeps to the rim of the glass. Great sticky chunks of lace cling to the glass. The color is a dark chocolatey brown with minute ruby highlights when held to the light.
I know I don't have the greatest sense of smell, but I was having the hardest time getting the smells to focus. What I could detect was a mildy sweet dark fruit and dark sugars. Taste helped recover for me. Very malty and thick, a bit of cloves and herbal spices. Strong alcohol warmth that leaves a lingering burn.
This is an absolute treat for quad lovers. Not one I would want all the time, just because it is so massive. I think it is something you should treat yourself to at least once a year. 839 charactersbort11, Feb 15, 2008
4.31/5  rDev -3.6%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4A very pretty beer, dark brown with a light brown/reddish, foamy head that is several fingers thick. Leaves tons of lacing.
First taste is the standard maltly quad taste that is big but not cloying, followed by a slight molasses. Next is a warming alcohol punch that is very nice and balanced. Finishes with a very slight hop bite and some peppery yeast. Great sipping beer.
Appropriate carbonation makes the mouthfeel of this beer great despite the carbonation.
Drinkability is hampered by the high alcohol content and the need to sip very slowly. Still drinkable, just requires some patience. 597 charactersHojaminbag, Feb 15, 2008
4.58/5  rDev +2.5%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Poured from 11.2oz bottle to snifter.
This Belgian quadruple pours a rich and deep brown/plum color. Massive tan head, bold and rocky on the pour, tons of lace on the side of the glass. The appearance alone shows that this is will be a high-class ale. All fruit in the nose, plums and raisins. The boldness of the aroma alludes to a very strong alcohol content. Taste is a complex blend of sweet fruit, plums, raisins, molasses, with an extra peppery kick at the end. Finishes with a big alcohol boldness that warms the belly and everything else going down. Mouthfeel is full-bodied and somewhat creamy, with an extra bit of fiz from the carbonation. Exceptionally drinkable.
This beer transports you straight to the old world. I got out the strongest cheese I could find in the fridge, some gorgonzola, paired the two together and just sat back and enjoyed it. Need to get working on planning that Belgian brewery tour. 922 charactersIgnatiusReilly, Feb 15, 2008
4.42/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Autumn leaves russet with dark cherry and orange highlights when backlit with sunshine. The sandstone colored cap is attactive, but it isn't the masterpiece that I was expecting. Perhaps the ABV has something to do with that. A few streamers of sea foam lace grace the glass in the end.
The aroma tells me that 10 will be one of the darkest quads that I've ever had. It's full of dark fruit (raisins and figs) as well as a dark rum-like quality that gives it both power and presence. It's also peppery and clovey in a kick-ass yeast strain kind of way.
Trappistes Rochefort 10 is excellent beer, even if it doesn't crack my 'top 10 of all-time' list. The aroma didn't lie. This has to be one of the 'blackest' quadrupels going. In some ways it tastes like a Belgian stout... without quite getting all the way there.
I'm amazed at the beer's boldness relative to how well-integrated the various components of the flavor profile are. Proper aging is the key, I'm sure. For reference, the date on my bottle reads '19 05 09'. As I understand it, the date listed is five years from the time of bottling.
The flavor profile includes dark caramel, dark rum-soaked plums, raisins, molasses, anise and cloves. Maybe a dram of Islay Scotch as well, thanks to a certain smoky, phenolic vibe. A perfect taste score is not out of the question.
The slightly louder than expected 'pffft' on crown cracking was worrisome. Sure enough, the carbonation was slightly too vigorous early and is slightly too laid back late, passing through the perfect zone relatively quickly. Still good, just not great.
Trappistes Rochefort 10 is outstanding beer that is pretty close to as deep and as complex as they come. I didn't get that undefinable *magic* quality that I look for in the best of the best, but it's an amazingly libation all the same. It's also every bit the equal of Trappist Westvleteren 12. 1,885 charactersBuckeyeNation, Feb 13, 2008

I like what I'm getting into when I pou my beer into a chalice. The appearance is cola brown, and the head slowly faded (in part by the alcohol). There's a lot going on in the aroma. Dark ripe fruits, cocoa, and alcohol seem to be the most dominating.
Oh yummy yum yum! The carbonation provides a kick of pepper to this sweet treat. There's some phenolic action going on underneath the flavor of dark fruits. I can find unsweetened chocolate now. Alcohol warms the throat and goes down nicley. If the carbonation wasn't as hot, this would go down like silk. Ok, I'm nitpicking there. 
Truly exceptional. 784 charactersDoubleJ, Feb 13, 2008

Their 10 pours a wonderful deep, dark, brown, mahogany appearance with an immense foamy and frothy head... chestnut-hue was very attractive with a faint aroma of figs and prunes... the smell wasn't as strong as I was anticipating... the taste was very good for a Quadrupel, but in my opinion, somewhat bland compared to the 8... their was an apparent thickness and richness in the flavor, which manifested itself with a nutty, butter, caramel, dehydrated fruit taste... good creamy, rich, and thick mouthfeel led to a good drinkability... although the alcohol wasn't detectable, the 11.3% ABV does eventually become noticeable with a warming feeling that slowly sinks in... Overall, a very good beer, a good depiction of the style... Definitely recommended... 914 charactersdsa7783, Feb 12, 2008
4.85/5  rDev +8.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Decanted into a Rochefort goblet, the beer appears as a slightly hazy deep reddish brown color with deep crimson hues. A voluminous head emerges of a light sandy tan color that nearly spills over the rim of the goblet. An absolutely gorgeous beer in every way. The nose is an explosion of sweet tropical fruits (pear, banana, mango), some candy-like characteristics reminiscent of bubble gum and hard Christmas candy. Underpinning these notes, a solid caramelized malt base is evident. This is one of the most enjoyable beers to sniff you'll ever have the pleasure of enjoying, without a doubt. The palate is a myriad of complex flavors that wholly embody the essence of what a Belgian strong dark ale ought to be. Roasted coconut, spicy banana and pear, subtle floral hops, and a wonderfully rich, warm alcohol presence. Some rich chocolate-like flavors add to the incredible complexity of this beer. The mouth feel is no more than medium and not cloying in the least, even with the aggressive sweet candi and fruit elements. This beer contains a good amount of carbonation, leaving the finish clean and rather dry with some residual alcohol warmth lingering long. This is, without a single doubt, one of the finest beers I've ever sampled regardless of style or origin. This beer is the pinnacle of the Trappist brewer's art, in my opinion. Nearly perfect, the much sought-after Westvleteren 12 really has nothing on this beer. If you want to taste Trappist brewing perfection, you really can't do any better than the best of the Rochefort beers, and one of the best in the world, Rochefort 10. 1,596 charactersbeerphilosopher, Feb 12, 2008
4.45/5  rDev -0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Oooh, what a great way to end a long dumb week of work.
Pours a deep light sucking apple cider brown, cloudy with some sediment. A creamy full head bubbles to frothy film with a little smooth lacing.
Nose radiates malt and yeasty fruits with hints of spice. Big bright apple character is grounded with darker fruits and a more subtle breadiness and deeper malt notes. A light pumpkin-like spicy scent is carried on strong whiffs of alcohol. Overall lightly sweet enticing aroma. Even the smell is intoxicating.
Taste is full, but not with intensive depth. Complete, without being too heavy. Bright, slightly bubblegummy sweetness offsets darker fruits of raisin and plum, with nice malt character and a cleanliness about it. Hints of tobacco and richer malt emerge as it warms, adding to a nice depth of flavor. Alcohol definitely makes its presence known with some heat off the back end.
Mouthfeel is lighter/medium in body with a creaminess to it, enhanced by the tight full carbonation. Some alcohol astringency to the feel.
Drinkability is in question, as this is a lovable and highly palatable beer, but the buzz, oh the buzz from the 11.3%abv. 1,154 characterslightindarkness, Feb 08, 2008
4.72/5  rDev +5.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4A: A very murky brow, with some sediment floating about. Rich head, off-white, with a nice lip of lace.
S: Upon straight pour: soft malts, and some dark fruit esters. Swishing in the goblet released an intense, huge aroma. The same aromas already noted + some sweet fruits & some bubblegum-like smell that I would expect more in a hefeweizen.
T: A rich, almost wine-like quality. Soft, clean malts. Candied fruits, and again like the aroma, a bit of a bubblegum taste. That note seemed a little unusual, considering others don't appear to mention that. Becomes rather tangy as it warms a bit (though it wasn't given THAT long to warm). In terms of the alcohol that's also mentioned in other reviews, I don't detect it much - at least in terms of a brew of this ABV, strangely. It was far more sweet and rich flavours over peppery and 'alcohol-warming.'
M: Round & smooth... big, yet with a very clean body and finish. 
D: Excellent to sip at. I started the bottle with a clean palate, for the sake of review. Being hungry, though, after half a bottle I paired it with baguette spread with a Brunet goat cheese. This was absolutely excellent, bring out some of the tangy sweetness in the ale. A wonderful abbey-ale, and something special to keep away for a special occasion or when the Westy is unavailable (like here!) 1,322 charactersProteus93, Feb 08, 2008

Taste is luscious dark fruits, with plenty of carbonation. I'm going to let this one breathe and warm up a bit. I imagine it will only get better.
This thing is very good. The carbonation has died down a bit, and now there is some dark cherry notes coming through as well. This is a world class brew. I'm going to have to stock up and age a few of these. 584 charactersFtownThrowDown, Feb 08, 2008

I poured into one of my snifters. I only poured like 5 ounces at a time, and both times there was 2.5" of a light tan head with nice lacing. The beer was almost completely black, very deep brown. 
Nice aroma with lots of spicy fruit like dried cherries and currant,and molasses bread. Super smooth, nice warmth and bite (at 11+% ABV it should be warm) with dark Cherry flavors, caramel, toffee, currant, a little chocolate. 
Super smooth and long standing mouthfeel. The more it warmed up (and I warmed up) the more I enjoyed this.

Poured a deep dark brown with some reddish hints. There was a small head that rose up quickly, tan in color it didn't stay around long before it gave way to some suds on the surface. 
Wonderful nose. Sweet and fruity with a strange "meaty" scent. At times is reminds me of a Ham cooked with pineapples. There are also some scents of cantaloupe, apple and pear. There is the slightest slightest touch of some toasty smoke. A wonderfully complex nose. 
The taste is sweet and tangy with notes of Cantaloupe, with some bitter cocoa and a spiced apple flavor on the finish.
smooth and creamy with an active mouthfeel. Tight bubbled carbonation scrubs the tip of the tongue. Foams up a bit in the mouth.
This beer is phenomenal I am still totally in awe of it....wish I could have another right now. 851 charactersDaggerEyes, Feb 05, 2008

The smell is of sweet candy malts, biscuits, wood and maybe slight citrus fruits (like orange peel?) and small berries and grapes....wonderful. The taste is near perfect...when I reviewed the 8 I had said that brewers strive to achieve the 8's quality...well, the 8 has been outdone by the 10. It is almost too perfect and too well done to put into words. What I can say, though, is that it taste of candied sugar, bread, wood, malt and very earthy with hardly any signs of the high ABV. It is silky yet light in your mouth and is extremely full bodied.
Geez...I'm still in awe of this beer...from now on when I purchase the Rocheforts, it will be the 10 an nothing else..this beer is godly. 841 charactersDouglas14, Feb 02, 2008

Odor is of cherries, sweet malt, dark chocolate. Hints of alcohol, some yeastiness. The nose on this beer was its least pronounced quality i thought, and that didnt appear to change as it warmed. just very subtle, almost a little too subtle, i thought.
Taste is hot with alcohol at first, and of sweet malt, held up by an amazing dark chocolate backbone. Spicy hops and alcohol warmth on the finish. Light notes of braised cherries mix well with the chocolate. Some yeastiness too. 
Mouthfeel is awesomely smooth and soft. Full bodied and creamy.
This is a fantastic beer, lives up to its reputation. Fan-friggin-tastic. The best of the Trappists that i've had and its hard to imagine that the Westy 12 could be better than this. 1,085 charactersaforbes10, Feb 01, 2008
4.22/5  rDev -5.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Pour is deep brown with a modest white head on top. Notable amounts of sedimentation suspended, but most of it was kept in the bottle and out of the chalice. Good lacing. Intense light fruits on the nose, pears, earth, esters from the yeast. I can get where some are getting olive aspects even. Very interesting.
Taste starts out sweet and fruity, big dark fruit aspects, plums. A smooth malty underbody, lightly nutty, lightly spicy. A touch of alcohol on the finish, but not much. Good. Alcohol becomes more pronounced as it warms.
The mouth on this is a real highlight, most Belgians aren't motor oil, but this one is the best in its class that I've had. Very viscous, it coats the mouth well. Drinkability, solid stuff, I enjoy it, I wouldn't hesitate to pick it up again though it is touch pricey.
The bottom line: If you like Belgians, the Rochefort beers are must tries. I greatly enjoy both the 8 and the 10 and 10 is the biggest beer in their impressive arsenal. It loses a bit as it warms, which is unusual for the style though, as the alcohol becomes more noticeable. 1,081 charactersCortexBomb, Jan 31, 2008
4.23/5  rDev -5.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Dark, opaque except for a cola-like translucence atthe edges. Fairly foamy, initially. A thin layer of tawny foam persists as the head recedes. I poured bottle sediments into glass. 
There is an earthiness to the smell, as well as some burnt sugar, and perhaps a hint of chocolate.
Peppery sensation, derived maybe from a combination of phenolics, carbon dioxide, and alcoholic bitterness meshes with sweet burnt cararmel.
Thinner-bodied, as is typical of most belgian brews. Easy to drink one too fast, because at 11+%, this deserves respectful sipping. 557 characterspweis909, Jan 24, 2008
4.23/5  rDev -5.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4The pour from the 11.2 oz bottle to the chalice kinda showed off a thick and syrupy nature. It's a completely opaque cola color with a thick and respectable head, which laced well.
I mostly get the Belgian yeast scent on the nose. Only other thing is a slight sweet breadyness.
A complex and unexpected flavor: mostly dark fruits. It begins with a slight nuttiness, it quickly takes on a note of sour in the middle, accompanied by a perfumey floral note, some delightful chocolate throughout the whole thing.
That alcohol hits me about half way through. The carbonation is very lively on the tongue. I must say this beer just made my day, I'd choose this over many other dark Belgians, except for Rochefort 8. 712 charactersjoeskirkie, Jan 23, 2008
4.45/5  rDev -0.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Sampled on 1-14-08
Pours hugely foamy and yeasty, the color a deep, deep red/brown. The off-white head lasts forever, leaving a wall of lacing.
Smell is a lot more malty than I expected. Dark, sweet, fruit characteristics dominate, with a great fermented, green olive twist. Lots of booze in there to liven things up.
Taste is very big, sweet caramel malt gives way to huge fermented fruit flavors. You can feel the alcohol in your nose, followed by an intense flowery rush. The finish is super dry, and just the perfect amount of bitter. Fantastic.
Mouthfeel is sublime, smooth and creamy with an alcohol harshness.
Drinkability is not as good, it is very sweet and very boozy.
Overall, well worth the money, and well worth the hype. 740 charactersBMoney575, Jan 15, 2008

A: Pours a deep mahogany with very little visibility. 1 1/2 fingers form in the snifter and hang out for quite a bit. Not quite a rocky as I'd expected. Some patchy lacing.
S: Sweet caramel malts with a strong but not stinging alcohol presence. Dark, pulpy fruits like figs and dates.
T/M: Potent stuff! Alcohol really brings a kick and it's incredible that it's not abrasive. Caramel malts are very tasty with a pleasantly controlled sweetness. Candied dark fruits but a bit juicier than in the nose... like fresh plums and grapes. A bit of acidity between middle and end. Semi-dry, alcoholic finish. Body is a touch about medium with a nice creamy feel.
D: A delicious night cap sipper. I'm glad this is readily available in my area but $6 a pop is a bit steep for more than an occasional treat. 876 characterspwoods, Jan 10, 2008

Delicious blend of dark plums and figs. Warming alcohol with big malts and spicy hops.

Appearance: Dark copper, very minimal head. Reminds me of sherry.
Smell: Raisins, dates, malt.
Taste: Dark fruits are about. Cherry, plums, raisins, hint of chocolate.
Mouthfeel: Almost syrupy, with a decent amount of carbonation. The aftertaste lingers on the palate, which is not a bad thing.
Drinkability: Definite sipper. For me this is a one and done, one to savor and enjoy. Drink this one by itself and enjoy the complexity.

A= thick red-prune-juice colored with mild red-white head. In some ways it looked more like a wine-grog or something.
S= alcohol very evident; fruity-malty mix.
T= does it matter? If you find this stuff, just drink it. Nice malt and liquor when first poured cold, and more evident prune as it settles to room.
M= slightly numb but very happy.

Aroma is of ripe plum, raisin, figs. Can't wait to taste this one.
Taste is deep and complex. Very nice. There are the aforementioned dark fruits, sweet and cloying. A hint of ripe cherry, a tinge of toastiness. A bit of a nutty finish. Walnuts.
Mouthfeel is clean and peppery, sort of dances on the tongue for a moment and then lingers around for a bit.
A wonderful experience and one I'll be sure to repeat. 572 characterskosmoraios, Jan 06, 2008

Smell: Yes, rather like raisin but maybe even like brandy. Strangely reminds me of antique furniture.
Taste: Like caramel, like brandy, a pleasant wine taste as it is warming.
Mouthfeel: Bubbly in the mouth become creamy.
Drinkability: A sipping beer, a reminiscence beer. This beer always leaves a wonderful warm feeling in my tummy. The best beer I have tasted. 483 charactersWilliamLious, Jan 06, 2008
4.62/5  rDev +3.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Let me begin this review by saying that I am not a big fan of the Belgian beers at all. I just haven't found that many that I really enjoyed. This one was different....
Poured a dark murky brown with a huge bubbly head and some carbonation as well...
Smelled very sweet, a lot like raisins and dates and other dark fruits. I also smell the alcohol in this but what can you expect at 11%? Smells very pleasant.
I was pleasantly surprised with this beer. It seems to be very highly thought of by all who try it and now I know why. It has a wonderful sweet taste with lots of fruit, some spiciness, and also some alcohol. 
Yep, this is my favorite Belgian so far. By a long way. The alcohol is very prevalent so this is a sipper but this is actually one Belgian that I will get again and enjoy again. 801 charactersTilley4, Jan 05, 2008
4.25/5  rDev -4.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4A- Pours a nice and rich dark brown with a 2 finger head that is soft and tan after a medium pour. Lacing sticks around and the film on the surface of the beer is constant.
S- Dark fruits, cherries, figs, plums, dates. Also milk chocolate and vanilla are there. Citrusy fruits (lemons) are present in the nose, especially after a soft swirl of the glass. The alcohol burns the nose, but the alcohol smell is not strong at all.
T- Molasses, milk chocolate, vanilla and warming alcohol taste. Also, it is somewhat woodsy and oaky. The roasted malts and toffee is there too. I do not pick up the fruity tastes though that I picked up in the nose.
M- Medium thickness and high carbonation. Love the mouthfeel of it.
D- Very high, but the alcohol taste/content keeps you honest.
Overall- While it is complex, I feel that it is not AS complex as I imagined. I am going to age the other one I have for a while and revisit this brew. Nice brew though; it is obvious why it is rated so highly. Sticks to the style and represents it very well. 1,038 charactersMMAJYK, Jan 04, 2008
4.89/5  rDev +9.4%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5a: This beer is a dark brown color, no hint of amber. Pours with a minimal tan head.
s: Huge and complex nose on this one. Warming sherry notes dominate, with some dark fruits (plums?) and sweet vanilla malts.
t: There is an awful lot going on here as well. Alcoholic plums that suggest sherry start things off in a big way. Sweet vanilla, smokey peats, and perfumed hops round things out.
m: This beer is amazingly thick and viscous. A minor complaint would be a lack of carbonation.
d: Thanks to my buddy Scott for splitting this with me. They aren't cheap but I just might have to get some more of these. 611 charactersDIM, Jan 02, 2008
4.22/5  rDev -5.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5True deep, dark brown color, with small 1 finger head. Not much lacing to speak of, but that's to be expected. 
Smell is nice and complex. Raisins, figs, dark chocolate, alcohol. 
Deeper, darker flavor than the nose suggests. Retains a fraction of the ripe fruity hints of the 6 and 8, but more heavy on the maple syrup, with much more pronounced dark chocolate flavor. Finishes with a smokey aftertaste. 
Good carbonation, actually more than I expected from this style. Leaves a relatively thick, but sweet coat on the tongue. 
Good sipping drinkability. Excellent example of a Quad. Glad I found this. 607 charactersBeerImmediately, Jan 01, 2008

The beer smells of toasty roasty chocolate and crystal malt and tastes very similar. The taste is smooth with creamy roasted malt finish. A caramel flavor with Belgium yeastyness is noticeable. The mouthfeel is soft with a smooth maltyness, light medium body and delicate carbonation. Wonderful taste but alcohol is present, although an important part of the complex balance of flavors, making it less drinkable. Damn good beer. 516 charactersBeerLover729, Jan 01, 2008

Smells of grape wine. Very nice indeed! There's a hint of caramel and maple creme here too.
It has a nice chocolaty taste to it... then I get a little of that wine in the aftertaste. 
This is an extremely drinkable beer. As you would expect, the carbonation helps with this as well.
At $7/bottle, you expect the moon and receive the galaxy. This is eons better than the 8 which is one of my favorites. 462 charactersrudylaw, Dec 31, 2007

Poured from a 12oz. bottle.
Appearance: deep, dark color, almost mahogany. Massive 3-4 finger head, unrelenting with active carbonation & tiny bubbles keep rising.
Smell: Wood-like character with some berries & malt.
Taste: Wow, Malty, creamy taste with a lot of sweetness in there. Fruit-like in body also.
Mouthfeel: The taste lingers a bit in the mouth, very smooth & the finish is semi-sweet. Very complex flavors that i'm sure i am missing some.
Drinkability: Wonderful sipping beer with a alcohol that kicks in about mid-bottle.
Overall: You can't go wrong with this one. Lots of flavours blended in & as it warms, it's even better. My only complaint is that i didn't have more! A must for Belgian lovers. 750 characterspapat444, Dec 31, 2007

Blind tasting out of the bottle being paired against Westy 12(year old), St. Bernardus 60th(over a year old), and Southampton Abbot 12(also over a year old). 
 The order of the beers between my brothers and I(all nuts for quads) was.
1.Southampton 2. Westy 3. ST. Bernardus 4. Rochefort
 It was however completely unfair as the Rochefort was far to young and all the othes had matured a bit in the bottle over the year.
 ANyways my review for this beer having it blind was this: Very pretty beer, dark copper color with a tan head, nice legs and head retention in general. Some lacing. Smell actually reminded me of Avery The Reverend a bit. Rich caramel, lots of candied sugar in the nose. Esters reminscent of cherries and bubble gum. A hint of apple also. But m main issue with this bottle of Rochefort was the fusel smell/taste. Some heat flaring up my nostrils. 
 Taste wasrich with caramel and some berries. The smell was sweeter than than the taste. Again, this beer was very hot(fusels). I think I actually detected some hop bite in the mouth which would lose it points with BJCP folks, but again this is a product of its age, not the true potential of this magnificent beer. Not that this is incredibly surprising to any one, but buy this and try after a year or more, otherwise you are in for an adoloescent beer experience. Beer brewed in 07'. Cheers. 1,437 charactersadamdotson, Dec 29, 2007
4.68/5  rDev +4.7%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Finally found a bottle of this and man, am I glad I did. Restored my faith in great beers after a string of mildly disappointing big beers I've had.
Dark brown color with red undertones. Really nice, tan-colored head. Fantastic retention on this, especially for a high gravity beer. Nice lacing along the sides of my chalice.
Aroma is very fruity with apples, caramel and spices apparent. Wonderful and complex.
Taste is amazing! A smooth, rich flavor that blends perfectly from initial sweet, almost tangy fruitiness to rich malt and toffee flavors and then to a great finish that has hints of earthy hops.
Nice, rich mouthfeel. Carbonation was pleasant and the finish was nice and slightly dry.
Very drinkable, as I found myself wishing I had more at the end. The 11.3% ABV was very well hidden (I would have guessed 8%), though I could feel it at the end. The best beer I've had in a long time, and certainly in the top 5 or so all-time. 945 charactersAaronHomoya, Dec 27, 2007

Huge wonderful smell of fresh white grape and tropical fruit, dark chocolate, spicy yeast, and raisin, with touches of pine forest, mint, and alcohol.
Tastes just like it smells. Great balance between fruity winy sweetness, complex chocolaty malt, spicy yeast, and alcohol, with minty herb and pine notes in the background. Fruit gradually fades and dark chocolate intensifies. Long chocolaty, yeasty finish.
Superfine carbonation gives it a creamy smooth texture. Very drinkable.
A classic. 584 charactersBeerzebub, Dec 27, 2007

Smell  Sweet ripe dark fruits, a bit sugary of dark sugars. A bit spicy and herbal. Slight alcohol in the nose.
Taste  Pleasant warming in the throat. Again dark fruits, maltiness, and dark sugars. Mild hop flavors and a bit spicy. Yeast lends a hand adding that little extra. Tastes excellent clear thru till the end. Alcoholic warming starts at the tongue and continues on down.
Mouthfeel  Good solid full body. Very smooth. Absolutely wonderful in this category.
Drinkability  This one is defiantly a sipper. I sat on this bottle for awhile until I finally broke down. Well worth the wait though. Highly recommended if you can get your hands on one or several of these. Words cannot begin to explain this beer, so you will just have to see for yourself. 866 charactersHomeBrewJunkie, Dec 27, 2007
4.21/5  rDev -5.8%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.5Review 100! Poured into chalice, pours the darkest shade of brown you can imagine, all but pure black. Thick, really thick, off-white and creamy head with great retention and lacing. The overall look in the cup is amazing. Smell is good but a little too much alcohol in it, but I guess thats to be expected with such a high ABV. Also some chocoalte, roasted grain, raisin, and touch of rum in the smell. Taste is wonderfully complex. Tingles at first and then lead to a nice caramel and chocolate taste on the tounge and leaves a raisin like warming sensation as it goes down. The first sip was amazing I must say. As it warms I started noticing more alcohol and some sweet sugar. I would say mouthfeel is medium with a nice aftertaste and somewhat thick presence left behind. Drinkability I can only give a 3.5 due to the cost and high ABV. Overall a tremendous beer, while not my highest rated beer of the first 100, its probably in the top 10, just as it is in the Top 100 list. Enjoy this beer slowly. 1,005 charactersbunnyhustle, Dec 26, 2007

The aroma is strong harsh alcohol (rum) with fruit cake, dark fruits and some sugary caramel malts.
The flavor is dark fruits, wood, sweet caramel and toffee with some bitter alcohol in the finish which nicely balances the sweetness but becomes a little harsh as it warms. The mouthfeel is medium to full with velvety carbonation.
Overall, a very fine beer with lots of complexity and nice balance. 509 charactersBeaver13, Dec 25, 2007
4.53/5  rDev +1.3%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5First off, Take your bottle and roll it on your table gently so the yeast that settled on the bottom of the bottle lifts off the bottom and intrudes the rest of the bottle. Pours a nice brownish/red with a massive amount of yeast. (awesome) Smell is fruity like cherries and other dark fruits. Taste is definately almost a wine. Class is close to a barleywine in my opinion. Very sweet though with little to no noticeable hops to finish off the palate. A very different type than I'm used to, but I very much appreciate the craftsmanship put into this superb brew. Very pleasant and light. A very drinkable but sipper of a brew. Elegance at it's best. 651 charactersDrinkinBuddy, Dec 23, 2007
3.84/5  rDev -14.1%look: 3 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5I let this one age in the bottle for about a month. I read somewhere that the monastery that produces this fine beverage puts it in the bottle right after fermentation, so I didn't want to review it being so "green". The beer poured into my Chimay goblet had a dense, dark brown color. The head that sat atop the brew was a soft, pillowy white. The aroma had a lot of fruity esters resembling raisins. There was a slight hint of sour in the aroma as well. The scent of toasted grains comes through nicely. The alcohol was definitely present in the aroma, but it had a sweet, belgian candi sugar quality that made it pleasant. There was no hop aroma. The flavor was a very intense maltiness. The flavor of dark, dried fruits was barely present. There was a great alcohol warmth with every sip, coupled with the carbonation, giving the beer a great mouthfeel. There were really no hop flavors that I could detect. The beer finished very dry, leaving a bread-like feel in your mouth. This was a very, very good beer. As to be expected from the Trappists. My only suggestion would be to age this beer longer, two or more years perhaps. 1,131 charactersRiekerStarBrew, Dec 19, 2007

T - Lots of strong tastes of Belgian yeasts up front, strong dark chocolate and dark fruit tastes in the middle, notably, cranberry and cherry. Very little alcohol taste is noticeable, except in the warmer stages. 
M - Rather heavy and malty, yet at the same time quite tingly. A good combination to prevent the malt from turning it to syrup.

4.57/5  rDev +2.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 411.2 oz picked up at the Boise Coop for about $6... cellared for about 6-7 months... poured into my red wine glass while listening to Sasha's Involver mix.
Big chunky lite tan head that dissolves to sticky lacing and a nice collar. A very careful pour left a slightly hazy walnut wood colored brew.
Aroma is tawny port.. raisins prunes... lite banana.. low chocolate and brown malts.. notes of catcher's mitt leather and lightly smoked jerky... a little flat cheap cola smell... nose-hair raising alcohol is only there at the last bit of the very warm glass... maybe some earthy hops that could easily get lost in the mix. sorta reminds me of the inside of a cigar humidor.
Great lite to medium body! Persistant little bubble carbonation that keeps all flavors intermingling very well. Flavor is complex dried fruit that plays into the Belgian yeast fruitiness. Figs and dates... curicao... a smidge of chewy leather in mid palate... a little warm lite roasted coffee.. yummy and rummy as it warms.... Mouthfeel is smooth as silk.. big and delicate at the same time.
I am going to be honest here.... I really tried to find all the little nuances in the Rochefort 10.. and I feel like I did a good job.. but I can't with a good conscience rate it that high. There is something in the back of my mind that is telling me it needed a gentle touch more maltiness/sweetness to tie everything together... don't get me wrong, to this point, this is my most highly rated beer, but I still think it needs more. Every time I've had this brew, I've put it up against another quad (or 4)... but every time, I've found things I "really" appreciate about the other quads that the "10" just does not have... but still, Tonight.... I am reviewing my highest rated beer to date. 1,764 charactersJohnGalt1, Dec 12, 2007

Taste is superb. Heavily roasted caramels, cocoa again, a little spicy. Alcohol noticeable, but blends in so perfectly. 
Mouthfeel is nearly perfect. Plenty of carbonation, body and flavor up front, smooth and silky going down, and a bit warming.

S: Warmed beer really had a unique aroma. Clear hints of fruit with some nuts/alcohol in the background. Enticing to say the least.
T: Fantastic combination of chocolate with dark fruits. The alcohol level was clearly there but soothing in every way. Complex without having the yeasty bread take over. Reminded me of chocolate covered and alcohol coated dried cherries and raisins. Delicious.
M: Syrupy mouthfeel with light carbonation. 
D: The alcohol was warming and perfect for the beer. Can easily back this one up with another. The complexity of this one will have me coming back for more, hopefully many more.
This is one of those rare beer experiences that really lives up to expectations. This one completely blew me away, what a great beer. Cant wait to get some more and try at different ages. Really a well made drink in every form. 1,040 charactersmarcpal, Dec 09, 2007
4.72/5  rDev +5.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5A: slow pour into a snifter from a 11.2oz bottle. opaque brown-black color with sediment. One finger head that rapidly receded with little lacing - what I would expect from such a high ABV.
S: almost indescribable - has to be one of the most rich and complex noses I have experienced from a belgian. dark fruits; figs, plums - with hints of brown sugar and toffee and a note of alcohol. I didn't want to drink this, because I didn't think it could taste as good as it smells.
T: similar to the smell with a nice alcohol after taste - very warming. On the sweet side for the style, not too sweet though.
M: creamy. coats your tongue. beautifully effervescent.
D: Difficult to hide 11.3%, but this beer does it as well as you can. I could drink a few of these if I didn't have to work the next day.
A great beer. One of the best most complex and interesting beers I have had. Buy this beer just to smell it and the taste isn't bad either. 941 characterselmore, Dec 07, 2007
4.87/5  rDev +8.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Poured this one into a couple of sampler glasses. Beer Karma is all about sharing after all. Nice deep mahogany color, ruby red edges. Good tan head but did not last long. It really seems right that it didn't though.
Aroma is of dark alcohol soaked fruits, prune, fig, and a deep bready malt that just warms you up inside. I could smell this beer all day and not take a sip. I've never had a beer with an aroma that had this effect on me.
Taste is a veritable sensory delight. Thick and bready, dark mysterious fruits and sweet Belgian malts. A real sipper. To be enjoyed with company for sure. You simply can not drink this beer without talking about it with someone. Warms you from the inside out in the process.
Amazingly full body, real thick in the glass and in the mouth. One of the closest things to perfect that I have had. 834 charactersZimZamZoom, Dec 07, 2007

This is the kind of beer that just by the nose alone, it almost caused my eyes to roll into the back of my head.
Poured a beautifull, very deep crimson with a tinge of red showing on the edges as it was held to the light.
Smell was wonderous...dates, figs and raisons to mind. Maltiness abounds. Bready thick.
Taste was great. Huge mouthfeel, very slick and oily. Taste of malt and fruits that have been soaked.
This is a beers beer! 454 charactersdmamiano, Dec 07, 2007
4.18/5  rDev -6.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours an opaque dark tea color with a huge stiff off tan head that resists fading in rocky patterns and leaves 3D lacing in its wake. The smell is nice; earthy Belgian yeast and dark fruits. Nicely carbonated the tiny bubbles of effervescence lend a creamy texture to the mouth feel. Full bodied, with a tingle of alcohol that adds nicely to the complexity, the 11.3% is well integrated. The earthy malt, raison and yeast flavors are more subtle than you would expect from a beverage with such a high ABV. Highly recommended. 525 charactersjjayjaye, Dec 07, 2007
4.41/5  rDev -1.3%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A- Poured from a 11oz. bottle into my Ommegang Chalice. Pours a dark chalky brown with a nice white head.
S- Nice nose. Bready, complex, notes of dark red grapes and figs
T- Bold flavor. Hits the sides of your tongue with a bit of acidity. I get a lot of grapes and dark fruits on the first sip giving way to a bready, beery flavor.
M- Think but not too thick on the tongue. The 11.2% alcohol doesn't escape through your nose or really hit you.
D- I really enjoy this brew but with 11.2% alcohol if I drank this all night it would be a short night. Nice complexity of flavor. 579 charactersMudpuppet, Dec 06, 2007
4.92/5  rDev +10.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Pours a rich ruby brown with a 1 inch tan foam head that dissipates to a ¼ inch layer. The aroma is present as soon as the bottle is opened. It is a predominantly malty aroma with overtones of vanilla, cloves and dark fruits. The aroma and flavor are very complex. Taste is moderately sweet, nicely balanced by the bitterness of the hops. Feels great in the mouth and does a good job of hiding the 11.3% alcohol. 
I have not yet tasted a better balance augmented by such complex aromas and will have to revise my review of Chimay (Blue, which I really like a lot). This is better. 582 charactersCDBeerDisappear, Dec 04, 2007
4.85/5  rDev +8.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Wow is probably the best word to describe this. Poured this from a brown bottle into my tulip glass. Looks a lot like cola, though has a thin head that dissipates, but leaves marks on top that look like cirrus clouds. Quite beautiful to watch, actually. Smells dreamy of sugars, fruits, spices. Absolutely wonderful. However, the smell was just a warm up for the taste that followed. Delicious Mediterranean fruits, such as plums, figs, and raisins make appearances. Not a trace of bitterness. Was absolutely perfect paired with bleu cheese. One of the most rewarding experiences I've had in beer drinking. There's no way I won't have this again. 646 charactersatrus138, Dec 03, 2007

Aroma is of figs, vanilla and other dark fruits. Taste is figs and candied fruits. Sweetness is a bit sugary at the tail of the taste. Also there is a bit of an alcohol kick. Mouthfeel is medium bodied. With such a high ABV it can definitely catch up with you pretty quickly. 387 charactershwwty4, Dec 02, 2007
3.79/5  rDev -15.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 3 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Bottom line: I've spent some time in Belgium and this is my least favorite Quad. I greatly respect the brewers, but I disagree with the high marks of this one. I might be the only one... Pours like coca-cola into a glass. Has about 1/8 inch of head that quickly dissipates. The smell is average for Quads: vanilla, hint of coca-cola (yep, I'm crazy), and figs. The taste is heavy for a quad. Definitely not on the sweet side: vanilla, some nuts, and then a heavy alcohol finish. Mouthfeel is great. Feels like heavy cream. This is a very drinkable beer. 553 characterswardough, Nov 29, 2007
4.13/5  rDev -7.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Pours a murky cola brown, cloudy, a good size light tan head recedes slowly. Aroma is large dose of caramel malt sweetness, some, raisins, apples, and alcohol soaked sponge cake. Hints of chocolate and ginger are evident in the aroma as well. Taste follows with a nice chocolate, vanilla, and caramel, nutty dessert bread flavor, nice and yeasty, some apple flavor before a biting alcohol warms and drys the throat in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium in body, a peppery effervescence of carbonation tingles on the tongue and builds to a foam in the mouth. Definitely one of the best quads I've tasted, perhaps not my personal top but right up there. Alcohol comes on strong at first but gradually the bite dulls, nice and dry, very enjoyable. 741 charactershoppymeal, Nov 25, 2007

Poured a murky blood brown with little particles of yeast that escaped the bottle. Smell of dried fruit mixed with a sweet malty aroma thats carmel bread. Taste of raisins, cherries, some candi sugar, and a alcohol finish that was almost ethereal. While the flavors are bold and refined they still cannot make 11.3% abv not get you hammered pretty quickly. 412 characterssfoley333, Nov 21, 2007
4.67/5  rDev +4.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I sampled this beer in a restaurant in queens, and it really popped out at me with a quality that I haven't experienced in a while. I usually don't have a "go-to" favorite style, or beer, but this one deserves consideration everytime I have a choice of Quadrupel or any Belgian trappistes for that matter.
I poured the reddish-brown liquid into a chalice and immediately sensed a strong bready aroma and warming alcoholic presense in the back of my nose.
One of the more alcoholic beers that I have tried, and, as expected, it cut through the intense malt and yeast flavors, actually balancing them out well.
This beer is excellent as a "stand-alone" experience, and I am sure that it will "stand-up" to just about any flavor you decide to pair with it. 756 characterstenorvoice0739, Nov 16, 2007

Smells of sweet toffee and dark fruits.
Taste is dark fruit and sweet bready malt. Alcohol warmth is present.
Overall this is a very good quad. Tasted side by side with a westy and definately liked the westy better. That said this is a great beer and easier to get. 318 charactersMonsone, Nov 13, 2007
4.15/5  rDev -7.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Saw this beer on the shelf and figured I would give it a go, again. I had tried it before and was not overly impressed but let us see how far my palate has come since then.
I pop the top and the beer attempts to escape me by overflowing. I didn't lose much but some did manage to find its way to the counter. 
Big tan colored head as I pour. I am talking three or four fingers of head in a Chimay Chalice. This beer has a "nutty" smell to it as well as some malty aroma. First taste indicates a slight warming alcohol that I would expect from this beers strength but not too over the top. This is creamy and nutty (vanilla maybe?) as well as a little fruity, if that makes sense. After getting 1/2 way through this bottle I must admit that this beer is strong. I am feeling this alcohol but I am enjoying it so I guess it is all good.
Overall: This is a quality product. The taste profile is very complex and I am certain that I would pick up some different flavors if I tried it again. Trying it again is a must for me. 1,023 charactersdough, Nov 12, 2007
4.53/5  rDev +1.3%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 511.2 oz. bottle, bought at Hi-Times Wine Cellars in Costa Mesa, CA,
A: Pours a dark brown, with a medium white head, a little erratic, but good retention.
S: Smell is weaker than I thought it was going to be and doesn't really come out until the beer is about room temperature, about 60 degrees in mid-fall. When it comes out, it smells of dark fruit predominately and alcohol.
T: What the beer lacks in smell, the taste makes up for it. On first sip, delicious dark fruits hit the tongue, raisins are huge, with some prune, and a bit of woody bark character. Lots of ethanol and yeast esters complete the complex flavour.
M: Smooth, phenolic, this beer definitely has an alcohol burn going down, but it is nice and pleasant, very mild, it complements the other flavours well, and is a nice ending to each drink of the beer one takes.
D: Drinkability is fantastic for a beer of such power and complexity. Even at 11.3% alcohol, it carries great finesse, and I can't wait to take another sip. A very expensive beer and kind of hard to find here in late 2007, but a great buy for an occasional treat. It would make a great nightcap as well due to its warming power. All and all, a fantastic beer. 1,199 charactersHalcyondays, Nov 12, 2007

S Yeast at first. Then some malt. Sine fruit notes then alcohol.
T: Wonderful. Slight chocolate yeasty taste. Wonderfully complex. 
M: Just like the 8 it is perfect. Perfect carbonation. Medium body.
D: If this wasn't 8.99 for a 11.2 oz bottle I could drink this with freakish regularity. My GF said she actually preferred the 8 but I disagree. The 10 is the apex. The booze is there but hidden very carefully. There is a reason this beer is ranked so high. 586 charactersaerozeppl, Nov 09, 2007

Dark color beer that seems opaque. Sticky lacing left on side of glass as I wait for the head to slowly dissipate. ( Wating a long time to get past the head to try this great looking brew).
This smells heavenly. Sweet raisins and figs up front. Light sweet molassis abounds. A faint hop spiciness can be found in the nose. 
Taste of raisons, figs, and toasted molassis. Alcoholic througout the pallet. Some hop bitterness ballances the extreme sweet and alcohol. Great balance. This beer tastes like it smells. Exceptional.
Moutfeel is thick, sweet and strong. Faint carbonation. A "sipper".
This beer is not for everyone. It is strong and full of character.

Poured into a Trappist Westie glass (respects paid to Westie)
Massive three finger head! Good thing it quickly went away. The smell is good with hints of ginger, cherry, and raisin. The taste is great. This is my second trappist and it was fantastic. A great b-day brew to finish (aka start) with. The taste equaled the smell and didnt disappoint. I would love to sit down and have a six pack of this its that spectacular. 
Overall: This trappist doesn't let you down. Its rich with flavor and smell. I would highly recommend this brew! Grab them, Drink them, Enjoy them.

4.67/5  rDev +4.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5I am often amazed at the huge head produced by Belgium brews and this is no defferent. Foamy and thick at 3 tan fingers tall. Body is a perfect dark murky brown. Nose is huge with tones of sweet malt, over ripe bananas, dark zesty fruit and spicey pie crust. At first sip the amazing complexity of this beer just explodes on the tongue with a wonderful malty zest. Dark fruit and rich nuttiness balances well together. Spicey feel carries this beer and gels well with the even consistant sweetness. Alchol is completly well hidden. A Belgium classic that is way to easy to drink. Mouthfeel keeps with the zesty, spicey sweet feel. 630 charactersSPLITGRIN, Oct 30, 2007

Poured very slowly to a dirty dark brown, left most sediment behind in the bottle. Fluffy thick head that looks like lightly toasted marshmallows. After sitting to get the chill out, some lacing remains around the sides of my glass.
Smells of alcohol, grapes, dark fruits, light aromas of dark chocolate and black liquorish.
Tastes mild dark chocolate, dark fruits and mild acidic red wine like alcohol. Nothing over powering. Finishes kind of sweet but clean with alcohol well known. Very warming in my chest. Great for cool weather! 
Mouth feel is extremely creamy and highly carbonated. Reminds me of a boozy dark chocolate moose.

aroma is fruity and grainy. fruit notes include apple and grapes. malts are sweet and consist of caramel and a bit of munich. no alcohol present, which is mildly suprizing. 
taste is sweet and malty up front, with caramel presiding over others. ale yeast provides the same notes of apple and grape, and contributes a bit of sweetness. alcohol is mild upon finishing, never fully revealing the 11.3% APV. very well concentrated and proportioned.
mouthfeel is medium-bodied, with mild bites from CO2 and alcohol. these do not deter from enjoying the brew, however, and make for an excellent mouthfeel. 
drinkability is great for a quadrupel. these brews are usually very high on alcoholic bite, but this one provides a presence of alcohol, while keeping it mild and subtle. very well crafted brew. cheers! 951 charactersbotham, Oct 12, 2007

3.79/5  rDev -15.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 2.5The last of my informal countdown of cellar favorites leading up to my #300 review...It was going to be this, but I pushed it to #299 instead. 
Poured the cellar temperature 33cl bottle into my 70s era Westmalle chalice, the 10 is a dark, deep murky mahogany, with a modest, but thick, creamy tan head that leaves light, scattered lace. 
Aroma is like no other, really exceptional. Very thick and rich, sweet, boozy. Lots of brown sugar, molasses, dark fruits and vanilla.
Taste is also strong, but more roast then sweet dark fruit, which are raisins and prunes. Husky, with hints of peppercorn and smoke, this is way more astringent then I recall, with some plasticy phenols and a very boozy finish. It's interesting that this was the first belgian I'd ever had, in some cafe in Amsterdam, and it left such a huge impression on me, that I've always fancied it my favorite beer ever. The last few times I've busted it out for special occasions, I've come to realize that's no longer the case. Still, it's a monumental beer, and will always have a special place in my heart. 
The mouthfeel is pretty light for the style, and very creamy and carbonated. 
Drinkability is pretty low, not to knock the beer, but it's incredibly rich, strong, and generally expensive and hard to find. Your just not going to want to sit down and drink more then one or two of these in a sitting. In fact, I find myself really slowing down with this last 1/3, with the booze and astringency leaving a lingering harshness on the tongue and all the way down the throat, particularly tickling my uvula. Damn, I need to get back to Amsterdam! 1,620 charactersccrida, Oct 06, 2007
4.72/5  rDev +5.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Had a mini quad tasting with HellsBells24 in April 07. Had this one after the Westy12.
Picked this bottle up at Top Shelf Liquor in Allen Park.
Appearance: Pours a cloudy brown color with a 1 finger tan head. Slightly red around the edges. There is a little bit of lacing on my snifter. This looks very similar to the others.
Aroma: Starts with some dark fruits, nice malts and a slight alcohol burn. There are some winey notes in this too which are very nice. This is followed by dark fruits, figs, roasted malts, and slight cherry. There is some nice yeasty and hop notes in the finish. The aroma is more pronounced as it warms. Can't wait to taste it.
Taste: The tastes are similar to the aroma, but not as noticable. Cherry and dark fruits from the start followed by warming alcohol and some spicy hops. There is a nice malt background that balances all these flavors. Very nice! 
Mouthfeel: The dark fruit and malt flavors hang for a bit. This is pretty creamy.
Drinkability: This goes down too smooth for 11.3%. It should be a crime for something this strong to be this smooth. After a few of these, you will feel nice and buzzed.
Overall. This finished ahead of the rest, slightly above the Westy12, Abt 12 and Chimay Blue. The aroma and flavors were a little stronger in this one. Another truely a world-class beer (as were the others). I've had this with just the Abt 12 before and the Abt was better, but in this case this bottle was better. You'll have to see for you self, you won't be disappointed. 1,518 charactersnorthernbrews, Oct 05, 2007

A- Dark cloudy brown body with bright red hues where the light strikes it. A beautiful tan creamy head fades rather quickly and does leave behind a nice collar. Some bubbles can be seen rising to the top and little to no lacing is left behind in the glass.
S- Nose is strong of dark fruit-particularly grapes and cherries with hints of chocolate and sugar.
T- A well balanced dose of cherry, chocolate, grapes, and sugar is upfront with a big malt backbone. Very sweet and reminiscent of cherry cola or root beer with chocolate. The finish is as complex as the initial taste with a big phenolic taste added to the mix. What lingers is a big alcohol afterburn and some sugary sweetness.
M- Amazing and one of the best mouthfeels I have ever experienced. Medium carbonation with the creamiest body that has ever come across my palate.
D- This is overall a decent beer. Great complexity and mouthfeel but it isn't amazing like I thought it would be. I do like it but it is not one of my favorite brews and I was slightly disappointed by this. The big alcohol presence makes the drinkability average. This is borderline barleywine. I would have this one again but I am not in love with it. 1,282 charactersPittBeerGirl, Oct 05, 2007
4.28/5  rDev -4.3%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4For my 99th and 100th review I decided to do a back-to-back tasting of Rochefort 8 & 10. Review number 99 was the 8 and this review, number 100, is obviously the 10. Comes in a 11.2 oz bottle stamped with the code L060612 07:59 (?). Drank out of my Rogue Überfest Pilsner glass.
Appearance- Pours a murky russet brown with hues of amber and yellow. HUGE tan head that spills out of the top of my glass. This thing is creamy, frothy, foamy and O so beautiful. Looks like a root beer float. Leaves a great cap the entire brew and foamy lacing randomly sticks all over the glass. Looks exactly like the 8 with a bit more head retention.
Smell- Lots of big fruit including hints of apricot, plum and pears. Seems to be a bit more fruity than the 8. Still has the same toffee sweetness from the malt and the farm like mustiness from the yeast.
Taste- Starts out lightly boozy but in the expensive, fine bourbon, top shelf kind of way. Very fruity but with more of a citrus (more hops for the extra ABV??) bite than the 8. Still has the same banana fosters features but with a tad more intensity. Hints of light chocolate and caramel hide in the background with traces of vanilla. Alcohol is covered quite nicely.
Mouthfeel- Has a bit more body and bite than the 8 but still super silky smooth.
Drinkability- This is also a fantastic brew (like the 8) that can be enjoyed at anytime. Its so super drinkable it almost sucks that its over 11%. I think between the 8 and the 10 I like the 8 slightly more. It seems to have a bit more balance and is goes down a tad easier (which is saying a lot). They are both great beers and must be tried. I can see why this bad boy is currently #7 on the best of BA. 1,702 charactersyounger35, Oct 04, 2007

11.2 oz. into my smaller Trappist glass.
A: Four finger sandy tan head. Head retention is some of the best I've even seen. Beer is an opaque dark amber.
S: Chocolate, coffee, raisins, rum and coke. Notes of vanilla bean and molasses.
T: Alcohol upfront almost a rum like flavor. Then bitter and malty. Notes of Unsweetened chocolate, bitter vanilla, burnt caramel. Leaves you with alcohol and a bitter bite that finishes very dry. 
M: Very good, very creamy and full.
D: This beer is strong. I'm half way through an eleven ounce bottle and my face is warm and I have a bit of buzz. But this is a really good beer and as it warms a few more flavors arrive. A good beer to sip on. 704 charactersbaos, Oct 02, 2007
4.88/5  rDev +9.2%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A: Poured into a tulip glass. I'm getting a finger of tan head. The beer is a murky brown. This is some of the finest lacing and retention I've seen.
S: The beer smells of raisin, gum, melon, and surprisingly, rum. This one is very boozy, but the other aromas come through more prominently. 
T: The beer tastes of raisin, pepper, chocolate, and licorice. I'm getting a slight nutty flavor, but it's subtle. The beer is so complex that it's almost not even worth it try and separate the flavors. Just sit back and enjoy this one.
M: The beer is full bodied and very creamy. Divine!
D: This beer is fairly easy to come across for a trappist beer and is a wonderful substitute for Westvleteren 12, so I'd snatch up as many of these as you can. Very drinkable with most sit down meals. 785 characterssessycuban, Oct 01, 2007
4.82/5  rDev +7.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I have sat on this beer for about 4-5 months and I cant wait anymore to try it. Best by date of 10 01 13. 
Pours a deep brown color with a decent amount of head; lacing and retention is great. 
The smell is very complex; some cinnamon, nutmeg, raisins, molasses, chocolate, fermented grapesit smells like freshly made bread. There is a slightly strong alcoholic aromalike rum or barrel aged beerbut it is not distracting at all, it is lovely. The aroma is so intriguing that my senses are overloaded with the broad range of smells. 
The taste is as complex as the aroma, easily the best quad I have ever had. Incredibly smooth considering the alcohol content. It has a nice warm and nutty flavor that reminds me of x-mas treats and winter holidays. What can I say about this beer? It is incredible all around. I really tried to find a flaw with it but I just cant find one. Im going to have to buy a few more to age and drink during the holidays as it seems like the perfect beer for the upcoming cold weather. Really, really close to a perfect 5 score.
I don't know how successful I will be in ageing these. 1,124 charactersseaoflament, Sep 30, 2007

Now for the 10
Served in a wine glass after about 2 hours in the fridge
A - Pours a very dark mahogany brown, much darker than the 8. Head is small, a few patches in the middle with a thick ring around the edge. Lacing is minimal.
S - Again, a big doughy yeasty smell, floury and sweet with fruitiness. Fruits are sweet and dark, plums and grapes and the like. A little bit of alcohol is detected.
T/M - A very rich texture starts us out, with medium carbonation, big malty and yeasty taste. A thick sweetness comes in with some dark fruitiness and then the finish: a warming alcohol sensation with a lasting fruity sweetness. 
D - A very good beer, much better than the 8 and definitely worth the 5 bucks. May benefit from a good solid aging. 
I think I prefer St. Bernardus 12 though. 829 charactersumustdrink, Sep 29, 2007
4.87/5  rDev +8.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5330ml undated bottle served in a tulip 
Wow what a pour. This beer doesn't look like it wants to be in my glass the huge billowing head rises four fingers above the cloudy mahogany colored liquid and that head isn't going anywhere any time soon. The smell is wonderfully complex, dominated by dark fruit from plums to raisins followed by more light fruit and pulled together by some phenols and alcohol spice. The taste is upfront prickly alcohol and peppery spice maybe a bit of hops but it seems to be mainly the alcohol. Incredibly warming but not "hot". Hidden beneath the alcohol is an incredibly full maltiness which suggests of dark bread. The fruit stays in there but it isn't as noticeable as it is in the nose overall the flavor is amazingly vinous, on taste I would take this over that $100 bottle of wine any day. The warming tingly yet deliciously smooth mouthfeel is pretty wild, not too light not too heavy just dead on. OK it's not a session beer but damn this is a treat worth every cent. Let me admit that I was a bit skeptical about this beers very high rating and wondered how much of it was hype. Let me tell you that after drinking one myself, I've become a true believer. Rochefort 10 is the real deal give it a try and you wont be disappointed. 1,268 charactersfank2788, Sep 25, 2007

Enjoyed out of my Tripel Karmeliet tulip glass. Pours a deep chestnut brown, slightly hazy with a rocky 2 finger head. Head is a creamy tan brown, short lasting and fizzy, with lots of lacing. Aroma is strong roasted malts with a definite alcohol presence. Lots of raisins. Tastes very malty with hints of caramel and vanilla. Lots of roasted malts with a nice balance of hoppy bitterness. Hops are not overpowering at all; very subdued. Mouthfeel is very smooth, with a pleasant carbonated bite. Not heavy on the tongue. Overall, an excellent beer. I can easily enjoy 2 of these brews, but due to the high alcohol (and high price) I can't take much more than that. 714 charactersdomtronzero, Sep 22, 2007

4.58/5  rDev +2.5%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a deep, dark burnt sienna with a light brown highlights and a solid three fingers of tan head with some brown spots on the fairly bit bubbles. Head ends up with a finger of thick froth. Lots of chunks floating around in there. Looks excellent. Nose of strong dried fruit, spices, molasses. Lots of cookies. Very light hoppy grapefruit. Incredible flavor. First cookies and chocolate, like the nose. Spicy alcohol in the middle. Almost no hop character. Strong raisins, cranberries, and other dried fruit in the middle. Alcohol comes back through the nose after a little bit. Fulll, creamy body; amazing, only topped by the 8. This one's amazing, with the only slight problem being the light alcohol presence throughout the beer (kind of tough to hide a full 11% ABV, so I won't fault them much). Delicious. 812 characterssoupyman10, Sep 19, 2007

Pours a deep dark cola brown color. Very light tan head, medium head retention. Mild aroma. Slightly oakey and sweet. A hint of non citrus fruityness. Flavor is somewhat oakey, with a belgian sour. Mouthfeel is slightly fizzy , light to medium body. Very lightly drying. Drinkability is high. Good flavor, decent mouthfeel. Certainly wouldn't mind another one after this, if i had had the foresight to pick up a 2nd bottle! Argh! 513 charactersBigJTrucker, Sep 16, 2007
4.28/5  rDev -4.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Appearance - Very dark and opaque. 1 finger of beige head, with very good retention.
Smell - Strong smell, although the smell does not have any interesting characteristics that you would not expect from a quadrupel.
Taste - Very strong malty bitter flavour, with clear hints of coffee and raisins. The alcohol is evident (as expected), but far from overpowering. Definitely one of the best tasting beers I've tried.
Mouthfeel - Quite smooth with a pleasant coffee flavoured aftertaste.
Drinkability - Definitely a slow drinking beer. It would be hard to finish more than one in a sitting, although the great taste alone may leave you wanting more.
Overall - Sad as it may sound, this beer is pretty similar to St. Bernardus Abt 12, but the sugar in Abt 12 gives it a great caramel character that the Rochefort is lacking. This is the only reason why I prefer Abt 12. However, this is still a must-try beer, and I certainly do not regret dishing out $10 Australian for the one bottle. 988 charactersCs1987, Sep 09, 2007
4.59/5  rDev +2.7%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A: Poured -- gently -- into an oversized Duvel tulip after debating whether to go tulip or goblet. . . . Body is a slightly reddish dark brown with a 1/2-finger ivory-white head that settles pretty quickly. Lots of sediment in suspension. Only a tiny amount of lacing.
S: Yummy. It's port-like, with the smell of rum-soaked raisins, cocoa powder and even cinnamon all noticeable. Also something sweet like honey or bubblegum. Very pleasant; alcohol becomes more dominant in the nose as it warms.
T: Dark and dried fruits -- berries, chocolate-covered cherries and raisins (rum-soaked raisins) -- and even a taste of brown bread. Slight tartness on the back of the mouth avoids this being entirely about the yeast and malt. Alcohol heat is also present at the end of the sip and down the gulley.
M: Smooth and spritzy in feel, medium to heavy in heft.
D: Damn good for a beer that's over 11% ABV. The glass was empty far too quickly. . . .
Notes: FWIW, I paid $5.99 for the bottle. I refrigerated it a couple months ago to hoist in celebration of a new job I began in July. Finally got a chance to enjoy it last night, so I hoisted this top-notch Belgian in celebration of my new job as well as in the memory of Michael Jackson. A beer certainly worthy of toasting with. . . . 1,280 charactersKendo, Sep 09, 2007

Dark brown with a nice head at first. Great lacing as I swirled this beer in the glass. This beer is not subtle at all. I found this too alcoholic for me. It had a very boozy nose and strong cognac like taste. As it warmed this boozy flavor became stronger. This was a slow sipping beer which I like.. It took me 1 hr to finish. 
I was real excited to try this one. I was a bit disappointed. This just was too alcoholic for me. It was good. But was it $7 good? I'm not so sure. 507 characterstendermorsel, Sep 08, 2007
4.54/5  rDev +1.6%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Dark chestnut brown color and a fizzy beige soda pop like head that reduces quickly but does keep a thick ring and surface layer. The nose displays wonderful aromas of dark fruits of raison and berries, firm malty, carob base, and banana. The first sip reveals some roasted malts and earthiness up front and ending with a hoppy bitterness and citric balance. Burnt brown sugar sweetness, anise, nutty malts, and aspartame shows up as it warms. The finish is long with notes of chary, hazelnut, nutty malt, and faint espresso. The alcohol burn is moderate for a 11.3, but this would make it a gem after some aging. Good crisp carbonation with a thin mouthfeel that is really good but was hoping for something a little chewier. 725 characterscabsandking, Sep 06, 2007

A - Dark brown with a large mocha head that has good staying power. Several minutes after pouring the head is still large, rocky, and creamy.
S - Dark, malty aroma of prunes and rasins. Alcohol notes, roastiness, and sublte, herbal hops.
T - Rich flavor of roasted malts and dark caramel. There is a distinct alcohol note and a fair amount of hop bitterness as well as some spicy yeasty overtones. The finish is full of wet, musty sherry notes boardering on cardboardy and a bit of a brothy, beefy yeast flavor. There are also some tobacco notes.
M - Moderately high carbonation. Slick medium body, relatively dry finish.
D - This beer is one to savor and share. The overall impression is of a heavy, flavorfull, cigar like beer. I was surprised that it retained so much carbonation after 2.5 years. It was starting to get a bit autolyzed, so I don't think I would age it any longer than this. 948 charactersnickfl, Sep 03, 2007
4.7/5  rDev +5.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Appearance  The body is very dark brown, cloudy to the extent that no light in my house can put a dent in the color. I controlled the head at the pour, but it was still big and left a filming layer on top of the ale. 
Smell  The sugars jump right out of the glass. The generous cane is the first one I caught. This was followed by crumbly brown and sandpaper raw. The heavenly fruits came next. The apricot led the way followed by overripe pears, Bing cherry juice, an orange wedge or two, a little banana, some figs, a piece of star fruit, and finally a quality red apple. 
The alcohol notes and mature malt bring up the rear. This is a very complex bouquet. 
Taste  Man, is this good. The sweetness comes out in force at the tongue. It seems like a drop of vanilla has been added to give it even more smoothness. I thought the malt might wimp out at the taste, but it stays its ground (an amazing accomplishment). 
Mouthfeel  Very lightly carbonated and smooth, smooth, smooth. The alcohol calls attention to itself at some point, but after the first sip or two you just dont care. 
Drinkability  This defines creamy Belgian Ale. Its just beautiful to hold in the mouth and the flavors will keep you busy all night long. What a treat. 1,259 charactersMaracuja, Sep 03, 2007

Pours a cherry wood overall color with ruby edges. As I stare into the center of this beacon of beauty, there are thousands of tiny bubbles moderately rising upward, thus helping to sustain a 1/4" off-white fine head. Fine sticky lace all the way down.
Smelling this creature is heavenly to say the least. A few slow swirls of the wide rimmed goblet, there's a blossoming fragrance of tropical fruits (mango, pineapple, apricot and banana) that have been slow roasted in fine dark rum whereas their natural juices have oozed, gummed and coagulated into a glorious montage deep, dark and bountiful scents. Burnt molasses and spice cake stand at attention, while pepper and cinnamon hide at the rear of the line. 
As the first sip trails down my tongue, my entire mouth is greeted by a widespread disbursement of rum soaked figs, white pepper dusted raisins, rye bread and burnt toffee. The dark fruit flavors are nicely offset by a woody dryness that keeps these intense flavors from becoming too dominant or cloying. The alcohol is mildly felt and well placed. There's a little heat in my chest and the roof of my mouth, but all very graceful. The complexity of this brew is staggering. There are many hints of flavors I *think* I detect, but they ghostily flee before my brain locks them in.
Mouthfeel is perfect. Velvety smooth. Down pillow soft. On the lighter side of full bodied, but that's just because the fine and perfectly present carbonation keeps things playful and young.
Drinkability is based on the fiber of one's being. I would to think one is entering a somewhat spiritual dimension when drinking this ale. And it's up to those spirits when they think youre time drinking their beer is up. I'll drink as much as they'll allow.
Overall a stunning force of brewing nature this one is. Like a deep and wide river; quiet and still on the surface, yet powerful and tumultuous underneath. This beer is holy. 2,004 charactersmalty, Sep 02, 2007

4.38/5  rDev -2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from the 330ml brown bottle into a goblet to produce a 1/2" head of beige foamy head that quickly settled to a clumpy cap. The beer was nearly opaque dark brown. Only a hint of maroon color shown through when held to a bright light. Slight lacing from the fizzy head.
The smell was quite understated. Hints of sweet, lightly roasted malt, and raisins came through.
The taste was quite good. The malt comes through first, followed by a buscuity, sweetbread taste that is followed up by an alcohol warming sensation. Then a fruity, plumb and raisin taste lingers and fades gradually.
The mouthfeel, as with most Belgians, is quite fizzy. The rich taste on this one over-rides the carbonation. It finishes very clean and crisp. The aftertaste lingers and produces a nice mouth coating.
The drinkability is quite nice. The 11.3% abv is melded nicely with the taste. 872 charactersTheBierBand, Aug 29, 2007

Above that it's sultry, deep, and I mean deep amber, with a touch of purple. The head is more pillowy and luxurious than whatever is at the head of your bed, and absolutely will not go away. 
This is five-star stuff all the way, and classy as hell. It doesn't try to impress with a bunch of mismatched flavors, it doesn't have to. Instead, your nose & tongue are graced with hints of the best, melded into perfection. Dark, as well as milk chocolate, caramel, dark fruits, and clean fresh air. Sinewy, understated hops take over, after which you're left with nothing but a tingling mouth aching for another savory sip. As the beer warms, I noticed a rounded bubble-gum presence toward the end of the taste.
If there exists on Earth a finer beer, I'm not sure my heart could handle it. By my best reckoning this is absolutely perfect. 916 charactersjeffjfindley, Aug 29, 2007

This is practically a barley-wine.
Unlike most Belgian beers of this style, there was very little carbonation or head/ head retention. I bought mine in a four-pack with a "Trappistes Rochefort Chalice", which made it all that much more special.
Unfortunately, my beer contained a lot of sediment. This distracted only from the appearance and not at all from the taste.
It is very dark, one or two notches down from a Guinness.
It is also very syrup-y, and sticks to your tongue, coating it with intense flavor and sweetness.
I find it hard to describe here what I tasted. I would take a sip, swallow, and say "Wow!". Then I'd repeat that process. People were sick of me after three sips.
I drank the first one far to quickly to appreciate it. To improve it, I'd like more carbonation and head along with less sediment.
Still... Wow! 837 charactersMAB, Aug 28, 2007

Very dark brown with active carbonation and thick bubbly off-white head that leaves nearly continuous lace up the glass as the head slowly dissipated. Smells of roasted malts and straw with a slightly alcoholic nose. Sweet grainy malt IF with long-lived slightly sweet aftertaste that picks up some bitterness with time. Full bodied with slightly dry texture, a little fizzy and clearly alcoholic finish. This is a tasty beer that is not as amazing as I was expecting considering the high cost of a small bottle. The flavor is not terribly complex compared to some others that I have tried in this style. The alcohol really comes through in the smell, flavor, and finish to the point of being a little too dominant. 809 characterswalshclimb, Aug 27, 2007

Appearance: Pours a almost black colour, almost no light shines through. 1 finger head w/ lacing as the head slowly lingered around. Beautiful
Smell: This is ALL over the place. I get some citrus, some toffee, plum maybe(?), caramel and you can slightly smell the alcohol
Taste: Wow....what can you say? Chocolate and caramel mixed together, some fruit mixed in...a touch of Cinnamon? The fruit is like a candy fruit, very good. 
Mouthfeel: Very fizzy, when you let it sit under your tongue you can feel the bubbles rising up. With it being 11.3 alcohol I assumed a more bitter taste and a bit dryer feel...but nope. The fizz is a little to much for me though
Drinkability: This is simply a amazing drink that one could surely enjoy but the high alcohol amount makes it hard to have to many in a night. But damn if you wouldn't try 878 characterslivingregret, Aug 24, 2007

I was lucky enough to find it during a recent trip to Virginia. Thank you Bob at "Once Upon a Vine" in Richmond.
Poured a 11 oz bottle into a tulip glass.
Appearance - It really doesn't get much better than this. Solid 2 finger off-white head that dissipates to a 1 finger and then stays that way for the rest of the drink. It is a opaque/translucent deep brown. Small bits of sediment rest at the bottom of the glass that oscillate slighty as I swirl my glass.
Smells - Wow. The aroma from this beer is all over the place. Notes of citrus orange, prune, plum, raisin, sweet salty toffee, roasty burnt candy sugar, and cinnamon. And you can definitely smell the booze in this one.
Taste - Tastes pretty much just like it smells. Very boozy with hints of toffee, chocolate and raisin. A very dry sweetness.
Mouthfeel - Medium to full bodied, very creamy as it goes down. While it is creamy, it is also very crisp from the high level of carbonation and has a dry middle. I can definitely feel that alcohol on my tongue.
Drinkability - Good. I would drink this all day if I had enough money to do so and if it were available in my area. And with the high ABV, that would make my day all the better.
This is the best quad (and one of the best beers) I have had the pleasure of drinking thus far. This is worth seeking out, even if you have to cross state lines in order to find it. An incredible brew. 1,545 charactersMiguelMandingo, Aug 16, 2007

Smell- So fruity! Dark fruits all thru this beer. Plums, Grapes, FIGS, slight alcoholic and yeasty phenols that aren't unpleasant in any way. There is also caramel and candi sugar hiding in this smell. I can't wait to taste this baby.
Taste- Oh! Orgasmic. Light fruits intermingled with dark fruits. Candi sugars are not over the top, carbonation levels are creamy and balanced. This is a many splendored beer indeed. Much complexity not even hidden in this beer. There is a bit of toffee flavor in the aftertaste. 
Mouthfeel- Alcohol is warming but not over the top. For an 11.3% beverage you would assume there would be a lot of stickiness lingering on the lips, but not with this one. The full body and carbonation really complement the beer. 
Drinkability- Very. I would buy this by the case if I had the spare cash lying around. The alcohol being what it is, I suppose I'm fortunate that I don't have that cash lying around. 
Having had and loved both this and the Rochefort 8. I am left wondering just how good the Rochefort 6 must be. 1,335 charactersblakesell, Aug 13, 2007
3.7/5  rDev -17.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3A- Deep murky brown which appears to be almost impossible to see through. Absolutely massive frothy cream colored head.
S- Smells of dark fruits, grape with a fresh grain odor. This brew has a distinct spiciness that stings the nose.
T- The alcohol comes through very strong from start to finish. Spicy fruit flavors seem to be subdued behind.
M- Highly carbonated, good viscosity but not nearly enough to be considered "thick".
D- Excellent brew and fairly drinkable. The 11.3% alcohol by volume certainly makes it much less drinkable than session brews but for higher alcohol beer it is pretty easy to drink other than the fact that the alcohol doesn't seem to be masked very well. 695 charactersLothore, Aug 12, 2007
4.47/5  rDev 0%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5An 11.2 oz. bottle poured into an oversized wine glass. This beer pours a clear medium brown color. The tan head was around 2/3 inch thick when poured. Settles to a decent surface cover with good lacing Malty aromas of dark fruits such as plums, apples and raisins were present along with some spice such as clove and alcohol. Perhaps a bit of chocolate as well. The taste is malty sweet upfront with hints of chocolate and the aforementioned fruits and spice and is rounded out by the taste of alcohol. very good balance. At 11.3 ABV this sure is not a session beer IMO. very good though. has a crisp mouthfeel with a medium body and moderate to high carbonation. Pretty easy to drink considering the ABV. This beer certainly wins at existence!

4.92/5  rDev +10.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5330 ml bottle into a chilled Rochefort challis. 
A: A wonderful, deep, creamy, rich and mahogany color. Very little carbonation yet a surprisingly abundant head. The head was two fingers deep and tan (Off/white almost caramel). The head consisted of tight evenly sized bubbles that linger deep into the experience and leave a nice lace ring on the glass. 
S: A subtle, malty smell with a hint of chocolate, figs and spices. A complex smell that matches the richness of this superior brew.
T: Utterly heavenly. Mellow complex blend of toasted malts that give off hints of rich dark chocolate, unsweetened figs and a caramel aftertaste. Hops are well hidden and there is only a hint of alcohol (surprising given its 11.2% ABV). No bitterness in the aftertaste, rather the sweet smooth flavor of the beer lingers on inviting just one more swig after another. This is a transcendent beer that defines a Belgium Quad.
M: Silky smooth and filling at the same time. 
Overall, awesome beer. Next to a Westy this is my favorite beer (in terms of cost per unit of enjoyment it out ranks even a Westy!). I keep it stocked for nights when I want to transport back to a cool spring evening in Belgium or overcome the pits and pratfalls of living in a country that cant produce beer anywhere near as well as a gaggle of Trappist monks in a land far away. 1,357 charactersdnichols, Aug 06, 2007

I am re-reviewing this beer to see how much if any my opinion on it has changed in the past year.
Pours a lovely deep brown/black with a huge frothy slightly off white head that stays all the way through the entire glass. This is how a beer should look.
Smell is very subtle. Alcohol is on the end of some sweet malt smells. A hint of raison as well.
Taste is fantastic! The only reason it doesn't get a 5 is because I'm still waiting for that one brew that will completely blow me away. Starts off with some mellow sugary malts, which are followed by a deep, dark fruit center. Dates and raisons make up the bulk of this succulent flavor. Finishes sweet but with just enough alcohol to remind you that it is over 11%.
Mouthfeel is perfect. Silky smooth and chewy at the same time.
Overall, one amazing brew! If this isn't my favorite, it is in my top three without a doubt. Highly recommended! 939 charactersbluegrassbrew, Aug 05, 2007
5/5  rDev +11.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5330 ml bottle poured into an oversized wine glass. Very dark beer, basically black. Can't see through even when held up to a light. Not a lot of carbonation. Thin lacing.
Complex smell. Chocolate, cloves, a touch of smokiness, yeast.
The taste -- oh my God. Amazing flavors, without being overpowering. A perfect balance of hops and malts. A touch of sweetness, chocolate. Smooth, full-bodied without being excessively chunky. 
The alcohol is almost totally hidden even though this packs a punch. This is so good that I savor every single drink and then even start to sip towards the end to prolong the experience.
This is the best beer that I've ever had. I just wish I had a bigger bottle. 703 charactersjar2574, Aug 03, 2007

After the delightful bliss of the St. Bernardus ABT12 and the 8. I was quite curious and excited to get a taste and compare with the best beers I have to this point, I was not disappointed.
Had this in my Corsendonk glass and the pour was nice...
A--nice brown color, three finger head, beautiful beer.
S--Fruity, like fig/apple/cherry, you can really smell the alcohol. I enjoyed the fragrance very much.
T--Oh boy is this a great tasting beer. For the strong aroma it is very smooth and tasty. I thought St Bernardus abt was the best (I have not had Westvletaren...yet) but I am starting to reconsider, kind of like picking 1 and 1a I suppose. I love the caramel aftertaste of this beer. This is really sublime.
MF--like silk, perfect.
D--Heavy freaking duty but so good. I get the impression that more than one of these could really put a hurting on you but I think I would be willing to try. This is probably the best beer I have ever had. I am totally impressed. 1,053 charactersgarbercury, Jul 31, 2007

Not as full-bodied as the Bernardus, it has darker, roasted nut aromas and a more crisp finish. The flavors are more intense with walnut and raisin flavors. The finish is long, with and elegance that makes it imminently drinkable. 308 charactersmaltysfalcon, Jul 30, 2007
4.55/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A: A deep, murky mahogany/black color, almost like swamp water, but way more appealing. A thin layer of head lies on top, dissipating to a miniscule ring.
S: A malty and alcoholic aroma, backed up by dark, sweet fruit and a spiciness that permeates the bouquet. Also, notes of yeast.
T: A roasted malt flavor that comes first, and stays on throughout. The middle is where a slight bit of hops becomes barely detectable, as the alcohol is dominant here. The sweetness is noticeable prior to and after the alcoholic taste subsides, and the finish is drying. The aftertaste is a great blend of sweetness and maltiness, an excellent ending to a solid beer.
M: Crisp and bubbly, lots of carbonation. The malt presence gives it a heavier feeling though, and it's somewhat mealy.
D: Wasn't sure what to expect, as I've tried the 6 and 8, but didn't want to hold the 10 to any unwarranted hype or scrutiny. Overall, a very tasty Belgian Quad, and a good choice when in the mood for a sweet and malty option that has a kick of complexity. 1,041 charactersCharlieMopps, Jul 28, 2007

4.77/5  rDev +6.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5I have had the pleasure to enjoy bottles I purchased in the US and Belgium. While it is common to cellar this big Belgian brew I must say that the fresher Belgium bought counterpart is superior as it lacks the oxidation that I feel detracts from the rich flavors of the quadruple. Wherever you buy it from it pours a dark mahogany with a hint of ruby on the edges. The head is not exactly consistent with some I have dissipating quickly while others lingering for a whileeither way, it is a slightly dark tan. This is one of those rare brews that show the best of beer can hold its own against the complexities of fine wine. You will certainly notice the strong molasses sugar notes from the candy sugars used in brewing. Plums, black cherry, leather, raisins and hints of roasted malts play on the tongue. The alcohol will not miss the senses as its flavor blends into the overall character and leaves the mouth and throat warm without burning in a pleasant balance that lets you know you are drinking something substantial and brewed with the alcohol balance only mastery of brewing accomplishes. 1,100 charactersbensiff, Jul 24, 2007

Off white fluffy head and one finger worth of it.Deep red body.I smell nuts and some dark fruits.The first taste is very nutty and sorda fruity and the carbonation is very attacking.Points come off for that.Almost like soda carbonation.Creamy head that falls to a huge patch in the center of my goblet.Nice lacing left on the sides of my glass.This beer taste amazing.The booze is starting to take over...Im glad I dont get a chance to try an amazing beer like this all the time cause it would ruin the fun of drinking this kind of special beer.You can taste the booze in this,being 11+ abv I would think it would be evident.I wanna drink all of this quick but im pacing myself,its amazing.Could the nut taste be the yeast?

4.8/5  rDev +7.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5I had this in a café in Amsterdam after a somewhat frustrating shopping experience with the misses :) 
Appearance: Beautiful dark...daaaark brown. Opaque and with some red highlights. A light tan head that dissapated in a couple minutes to leave a flat top with some yeasty floaties.
Smell: Very aromatic with fruity notes and cane sugar notes. You can tell that it's a high gravity beer simply by the sugary aroma. There is only a hint of alcohol in the aroma, however, as the rest is just fruity, sugary goodness.
Taste: My first taste I was in the middle of a conversation, however I was immediately taken aback by the intensity of the flavours. Prune, raisin, figs, and a nuttiness that I can only relate to chestnuts.
Mouthfeel: Slightly overcarbonated. When I say this, this is a nit-pick, because it was almost perfect.
Drinkability: I ended up not feeling too well after drinking a few beers before this because it was so silky smooth. 11.3% is sooo undetected it's scary. The flavour keeps you drinking and the alcohol keeps you in check at the end of the night. No more than 2 11.2OZ bottles a night, for sure.
Overall: This was the most memorable beer I drank on my trip to Europe. Definately the most flavourful out of the Trappists I got to try(5/6 breweries ain't bad...Dangit Westveletren!!). 1,326 charactersHornet2003, Jul 22, 2007
3.35/5  rDev -25.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3Appearance - Whoa!!! A HUGE foamy beige head. The head has amazing staying power, and leaves behind a very sticky lace. The body is a failry clear black/burgandy.
Aroma- The head has a slightly soapy aroma. Once you get through the head into the actual beer, there is some malt sweetness with hints of raisens, ripe plums and licorice.
Taste- Starts out immediatly with lots of complex malt sweetness, which gives way to more delicate flavors including dark, ripe fruits, alcohol (including some fusils), and a a spicy, peppery, hot finish. It starts out very nicely, but as the taste progresses through your mouth, it gets to hot and peppery.
Mouthfeel - The high ABV plays a part here, giving the beer a mouthfeel that is light in comparison to all the flavours on offer. 
Reasonably smooth and creamy, carbonation is low to moderateMedium mouthfeel. Decent carbonation level. Has a very dry middle.
Drinkability - I'm not real big on Beliums, so I won't dog this, but it ain't for me. If your into Belgians, definately try it. 1,044 characterstheopholis, Jul 18, 2007

Poured a towering four fingers of foamy beige head. This reduced to, and stayed at around two fingers. The colour is a solid black unless held to the light, where it is near-golden around the edges.
Smell - 4.5
The alcohol is immediately evident, but not overpowering. Other smells include licorice, sweet malt, milk chocolate and liquor soaked raisins. Smells better the warmer it gets.
Taste - 4.5
Wow! It is really impressive how well the high alcohol volume is hidden behind the delicious flavours. I can taste a general fruitiness mixed with molasses, a fair dose of pepper (perhaps a little too much), and a slight woodiness not disimilar to that found in wooded wines. While quite well hidden, the alcohol is reasonably strong, particularly in the aftertaste.
Mouthfeel - 4.5

I really can't see anyone wanting more than one of these in a sitting, it is really best enjoyed sipped slowly.
OVERALL - 4.45
No doubting this is an excellent Quadrupel, but I did not enjoy this as much as I have before, perhaps because I drank it a little to quickly and should have paid more respect. It was far more enjoyable once I got out some blue vein cheese to go with it. Probably the best beer I have yet to sample, would have scored higher were it not so alcoholic. 1,480 charactersLittleCreature, Jul 15, 2007

4/5  rDev -10.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4I must preface this by saying I've heard a lot of good things about this beer and sometimes when that happens people tend to over critize or under critize said beer. So as much as this beer gets raved over I have to say it was good but not phenominal imho. So on to the review.
Pours from a bottle a murky dark brown and leaves a few yeast particles floating around with a thick tan head that clings to the glass. The aroma is dark pitted fruit, rum raisin, candied fruit, brown sugar, spicy, bready aroma. The taste starts spicy, herbal in nature, a bit sour, dry, fruity, with a warming alcohal finish. Overall a good beer but not worth the price tag of $7/12oz bottle. 674 charactersFranchise, Jul 13, 2007

Wow!! This 11.2 oz bottle poured into a Rochefort chalice appears as one of the best I've seen. Dark and thick to almost porter or stout proportions. A thick, creamy head, about a finger and a half recedes slowly and has incredible lace throughout the experience. 
Bread and dark fruit dominate the aroma. Raisins and plums mostly and the taste presents caramel and those fruit tones and fresh bread again. Man, trappist monks have got it down! Rochefort 10 is very smooth and thick, almost silky as I sip it. And it's smoothness grows as it warms to room temperature. I would love to sit and go through a bunch of these, but this is one of those that demands more respect than that. One of the best for sure, but not to be over-consumed. Awesome, awesome beer!!!! 887 characterschrhowe, Jul 13, 2007

Unfortunately I can't rate it as high as the St. Bernardus Abt 12 I had last night. Maybe had I tried them in the reverse order things may have been different. Anyway, this poured a dark reddish-brown with a small head (the first contrast with SS). The head disappeared rather quickly. The aroma was very similar with robust bread and malt tones as well as plums. It felt great on the tongue with a full-bodied feel. As for the taste, I'm not sure where it failed when compared to the SB, but it just failed to measure up. Possibly the higher alcohol content which I noticed more in this brew. 661 characterscyrenaica, Jul 13, 2007

I had a bottle last night (7/5/07) and it was just as good as the first time I tried it. I used to only be able to get this beer when I went home to the Bay Area, but with the opening of the BevMo in San Luis Obispo, I have plenty of access to this beer, and I can't wait to get more.

Pours a deep, dark brown, near black with a creamy head that laces the glass. Brown sugar is the most dominant aroma, with hints of some dark fruits like raisins and a bit of molasses as well. Taste is semi-sweet with pear, plums and port dominating the palate, also a little black cherry. It's a complex beer that goes down smooth with a bit of alcohol to warm you, but not as much as you would expect. All in all, a fantastic brew, a sipper, but a definite treat. I wouldn't get this every day, but it's a one-in-a-while brew. 633 characterssaintwarrick, Jul 04, 2007
4.87/5  rDev +8.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Brewed at the Abbaye de Notre Dame de St. Remy in Belgium by monks, this is a beer that is truly "heavenly." The Trappist monks of Belgium are known for their ability to brew beer and this is definitely a great experience that any lover of fine food and drink should try. Enjoyed this one slowly, accompanied by Gabriel Faure's Requiem to add to the "religious aspect" of this beer's existence.
Appearance: Served in a tulip glass. Pours cola-brown, or slightly darker with a tan 3 finger head that sits delicately upon the brew for quite some time. Yeast is visible and can be served without, but I prefer it in.
Smell: Evolves as the beer warms, and is best at slighly below room-temperature. Spicy with hints of dark fruits, especially plums and faintly of raisins. Alcohol smell is noticable after a long waft, but is quickly covered by sweet chocolates.
Taste: My God... best at slightly below room tempurature, this is one of the most complex beverages I have ever consumed. Immediately bombarded with dark fruit flavors as evidenced in the nose - plum, raisin, hint of red apple, dark grapes - along with a certain lingering spiciness. Tastes like a beautifully aged wine - port maybe? Mid palate is of semi-sweet chocolate, hints of caramel and licorice... perhaps like Sambuca, but not as alcoholic tasting. Finishes smoothly with more of the semi-sweet characteristics coming out and mixing with light chocolate. These are all flavors I experienced at some point during this experience... heavenly.
Mouthfeel: Smooth and velvety. Hits the tongue with a hint of carbonation, but then spreads, coating the tongue with it's amazing flavor, then slowly swallowed, allowing a full evolution of flavor throughout. Warming is the word that immediately comes to mind...
Drinkability: Hits you right in the face with its alcohol content. Very noticable up front, but I'm tempted to get another. A very special brew, to be enjoyed slowly. Not one to pound down.
I want to give this a perfect rating so badly, but I don't think I will ever do that. All I can do at this point is to thank God for creating Trappist monks, and for allowing them to share with us a taste of heaven here on earth. 2,209 charactersBucBasil, Jul 01, 2007

A: Beautiful! It's a plum purplish brown sort of color with a wonderful small light fluffy head that leaves behind a beautiful pattern of lace.
S: Believe it or not, I smell bubblegum. It has a wonderful nice sweet aroma that reminds me of a freshly opened back of bubblegum, grape Hubba Bubba perhaps? 
T: Like most quads it has a winy taste about it. Reminds me of a wonderful port wine. It has such a nice sweetness about it. I taste dark fruits like raisins, plums, mixed with brown sugar. The malt backbone that this is brewed around is exquisite.
M: Creamy, Milky, Ultra Smooth. Rochefort got this one right.
D: I have to be honest one and I am done, this is not a slight, it is common with most quads that I drink.
Overall: Great beer. Once again may God bless those Belgian Monks. All beers brewed in a house of god truly are works of god, and are to be admired. I love this beer and could load my refrigerator with it. I have to admit though when it comes to quads I am in love with Westy 12 and would take it over this one any day. I also am a big fan of the Rochefort 8 which I prefer over this one as well. When it comes to Belgian Brews my list is as follows:
Westy 12
Westy 8
Rochefort 8
Rochefort 10
The difference between these three beers is marginal at best. Once again god bless the monks, and enjoy the beer! If you are lucky enough to consume any on the list above you have been anointed. 1,633 characterstpd975, Jun 29, 2007

4.63/5  rDev +3.6%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5I took this following the day I had my Rochefort 8 so basically I conquered 3 Rocheforts in 3
separate nights. The Rochefort 10 is a Quadrupel which is highly acclaimed in the Beerdom and I 
definitely agree that it is a great beer. The Rochefort 10 pours out brown black with a nice
thick head with pretty good retention. As with the 2 other Rocheforts, it looks great with a nice
smooth looking head. A strong smell emanates from the glass dropping a distinctive hint of rich
and unique fruitiness, a precursor to a truly complex fruity taste that is to be expected. Also
obvious in the smell is a certain tartness which further exemplifies the already promising smell.
The taste was big on fruits and indeed complex with many different kinds of fruit; naming a few,
I can sense apples, grapes, plums, dates, berries and other fresh smelling dark fruits. The taste
has a certain strength or character to balance up the entire feeling of the beer with a dash of 
sweetness. The taste was also clearly mellow despite it being a very strong ale at 11.3 ABV; the
smoothness in the taste bears witness to masterful brewing which well masqueraded the alcoholic
strength. There is significant floral aromas blended with alcholic phenols on the nose and I
found that really pleasant; the slight bitterness in the finish did nothing to detract the
greatness from this beer. The body is sufficiently thick with a clear level of carbonation is 
goes in really smooth boasting of great drinkability for an 11.3 ABV monster. The after taste
was another party for the pellates as all the complex fruitiness slowly converges to form a
citrusy, grape and plum like tastes which proves to be fairly lasting. The Rochefort 10 is truly
a great beer. Rocheforts are generally smooth, mellow, fruity beers with great appearance and
great in masking a strong ABV. The general improvement that could apply across the board for all
Rocheforts would be a thicker body and maybe a tad bit of sweetness more. 2,003 charactersbasica, Jun 25, 2007
4.8/5  rDev +7.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4This may be the best beer I've had to date (Still haven't had Westveleteren). Had it out of a bottle into a proper Rochefort glass. The taste & smell were absolutely outstanding. Never have I nursed a beer like I did this one. 
This beer is exceptional in all aspects except one - drinkability. Because of the 11.3% ABV, you can really only have one. Aside from that, this beer is fantastic. 394 charactersjdubjacket, Jun 23, 2007
4.32/5  rDev -3.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Pours with a dense tan head, big at first, about half falls quickly but half remains with good retention. Big, fruity esters up front, alcohol and noticeable tones of bubble gum and banana mixed with cinnamon and brown sugar malt sweetness. Very nice. Flavor exhibits nice complexity that enhances as it warms. Bubblegum, raisins, and a sweetness that balances with alcoholic warmth dominate. 
An excellent example of a strong trappist ale. In my area its so expensive at around $8 per 11.2oz bottle that its only a rare treat, but one that everyone should have at least once. 583 charactersmarksto, Jun 20, 2007
4.65/5  rDev +4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Setting: On the back patio on a comfortable 70 degree evening. Poured from the bottle into my riedel brandy snifter, and watched the kids play.
Appearance: Pours a dark mahogany with only a hint of clarity and a thick 2 finger fizzy tan head which leaves nice lacing on the glass.
Smell: Wonderful nose that offers dark fruits, fine spices, port, some alcohol and a slight nutty sense. I spent the better part of 5 minutes just enjoying this aroma. 
Taste: Fantastic array of dark fruit, nuttiness, buttery burnt malts, a touch of hops and a slight hint of what I think may be banana on the finish. An exceptionally balanced brew which only improves as it warms. 
Mouthfeel: Creamy and silky smooth. Wonderfully chewy, coated the mouth well as to add to the experience. 
Drinkability: The carbonation and complex flavors help hide the ABV with this beer so it is very deceptive and will sneak up on you. 
Final Thoughts: First off I would like to thank God and the monks for making this available to me anytime I want one. This is a truly fantastic beer that has monster signature flavors and aromas that are sure to please. 1,142 characterssession1979, Jun 19, 2007
4.69/5  rDev +4.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Update as of June 1, 2010. Picked up for of these, figured I might do a vertical tasting of this beer once a year for the next for years.
Aroma is reminiscent of vanilla, allspice, nutmeg, faint cinnamon roll. All these aromas are rather faint but I feel that may be because I took a sip before noting the aroma.
Right now the flavor on this is as delicious as I remember. Loads of sweet caramel glazed fruits, banana, clove. Cherry and dough come through like a hot breeze in the finish followed by a quick breath of alcoholic heat that is the only indicator of the heaviness of this beer. This beer has a sort of indescribable kind of fruity, bready, buttery sweetness to it, if I had to try and describe it it would be star anise, butterscotch, sweet cherry, bread dough all rolled into one with each flavor able to be distinguished from the next.
Feel is quite powerful, very bubbly and with only a hint of alcoholic heat. Lovely aftertaste on this beer, bit of star anise, toasted bread-crust with a soft, uncooked, doughy center.
Interested to see how this beer ages in the time capsule I have going in the basement. Also to add to the vault: 
It is 9:58 pm on Tuesday June 1, 2010.
Brother is watching the Sox losing to the Texas rangers 8 to 6 in the top of the eighth inning. They are playing at home, JJ Putz on the mound with Vlad at second base.
Sitting at the kitchen table with my back facing the window. Empty Diet Pepsi bottle on the other end of the table resting on the white and blue place-mat. Watched Any Given Sunday earlier and was in the second week of one hundred pushups.
___
11.2oz bottle poured into oversized wine glass.
A:Pours a deep ruby, nearly black with minimal head, little bubbles of carbonation here and there, quite nice.
S:Very powerful aromas of smoked, buttery malt flavors, hints of plums and grapes, coffee and chocolate with hints of toffee, big complex aromas all very balanced, absolutly wonderful.
Taste/Mouthfeel: Big buttery coffee flavor rolls across the tongue and lasts and lasts, licorice spice comes in as the beer warms in the mouth with deep plum fruitness that finishes with a warming alcohol balanced with chocolate and coffee flavors. Huge flavors buried in this beer all exceptionally balanced.
Drinkability: One of the best beers I've had in a while and fantastic pairing with a nice peppery steak would pick up again 2,392 charactersbluemoonswoon, Jun 18, 2007

S: Spicy vanilla, clove, roasted malts, and alcohol is present. 
T: Very complex flavors Starts of spicy and peppery with a lot of alcohol present. Burnt malts and a slight hop presence. It is hard to pick out the different flavors as they work as one so well. This beer has many Porter qualities.

Vanilla, fig, caramel, toffee, slight alcohol, 
Earthy fig flavors are very prominent. Some prune, raisin, black pepper, dark caramel, pink bubblegum, banana, alcohol and some chocolate. Intensely complex. Bone dry finish.
Silky smooth mouthfeel that is some how light and airy at the same time. Carbonation is perfect for the style. Complex, flavorful, and extremly digestable, this is a top notch beer that every beer enthusiast should try at least once. One of my all time favorites. 555 charactersbosco7, Jun 14, 2007
4.72/5  rDev +5.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5This is one of my favorite beers. My wife is always really glad when I crack one open, if I'm not careful, she'll finish my glass behind my back. There are so many great things to say about this beer, I'm not sure where to start. I think I'll just give up and urge you to try it for yourself. 
Wonderfully complex, both in the aroma and in the taste, it seems to change a little bit every degree it warms. If this wasn't so costly in the states, I'd buy it by the case. The high ABV is so cleverly hidden, it sneaks up on you, so sip this one and savor each one. 565 charactersCascadia, Jun 11, 2007

Awesome smell! hints of chocolate, toffee, orange spices, licorice, caramel and molasses dominate. I hope it tastes as it smells.
WOW! Tastes tremendous. Many of the same smells that came into play also dominate the taste. The alcohol comes through nicely, but is masked so gently by the many different flavors such as coffee and caramel. Really complex and you get a new flavor each time you drink it.
Feels creamy on the mouth and not as heavy as you would expect. Such a delightful beer, definitely not one you would want to drink all night though due to the high ABV. 653 charactersJustinOSU99, Jun 10, 2007
4.25/5  rDev -4.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5I've been meaning to review this for a while. Usually I'm too busy enjoying it to take any notes, but this time was different.
The appearance was a typical Trappist quad, muddy brown with a red tint. The aroma held hints of citrus and was almost milky and cola-like. The flavor was very mellow, almost like a sweet old ale. It feels creamier than the Bernardus, though I unfortunately can't compare it to the Westlveteren yet. There's a little banana with the subtle fruit malt flavors. Like the other quads, this isn't the boldest beer. But despite the alcohol, it's oh-so drinkable if you can afford it. 608 characterstempest, Jun 09, 2007
4.78/5  rDev +6.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5A: A deep dark brown, topped with 1"+ of thick tan head that immediately clings to the glass. The head is very creamy. I cannot imagine a better looking beer.
S: Soft, sweet aroma, laced with hints of bananas and other miscellaneous fruits and molasses in the malt. Heavenly...
T: Perfect taste. It has been 5+ years since my last Rochefort 10 and it is as delectable as I remember. Taste is comprised of light phenols and fruit (banana and grape, mostly) and a bit of bread. Nice undertone of spicy hops to add a bit of pepper to the palate. I've had beers that are the best that their style can taste...but this is the best that beer can taste.
M: Creamy and smooth, warming alcohol down the throat with a great aftertaste.
D: This is a must-have beer. Of the trappists available in the U.S., none are better. Nevertheless, this is not for the faint of heart.

4.62/5  rDev +3.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A- Thick dense tan head about 3" on a murky dark brown body. Great head retention with it sticking on the side of the glass as it slowly bubbles down.
S-Alcohol comes through the thick chocolate malts. In this there are blends of toffee, sweet brown sugars, cloves, almost like a banana spice, lighter dark fruits, some breads. Just a great complex aroma!
T- Strong alcohol cuts through the big malts and warms the throat. Chocolate, toffee, a handful of sugars, hints of grapes, plums and other darker fruits, hints of cloves throughout, light grass hops just to help balance it out a tiny bit leaving a very light bitterness, all help make up this brew. I am sure there are a few flavors I am missing out also. Very complex beer.
M- Full body with low carbonation.
D- It is pretty darn good. I would say (flavor wise) it is in between a Westys 12 and a St. Berny's 12. However for carbonation it leans a lot more towards Westy 12. Very good beer just a tad bit pricey IMO. 978 charactersBlindPig, Jun 07, 2007
4.52/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a very dark brown with a fizzy head that is all but gone now. A lot quicker than the 6 and the 8.
Smells of banana chips hit me as I poured the beer and now I get more of a sweet malty smell with some alcohol in there. Dark fruits and some flowers.
Dark roasty sweet and malty up front. A dry tart finish. You can certainly feel the alcohol in this one. Warms and a slight sting in the back of the throat. Slight bitter hops in the aftertaste. A tootsie roll flavor in there if you took out the sweetness. Some dark bitter chocoalte as well.
A full body beer. You can almost chew through it, yum. Very carbonated like the other two. It cuts the alcohol bite somewhat.
I like this the more I get into it. At first I was slightly disappointed but now I'm loving the beer. I'd buy this again. I'd like to age it a few years to see how things pan out. 865 charactersdren, Jun 06, 2007
4.67/5  rDev +4.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to Westweasel for the trade on this one.
A- Very dark brown with two fingers of cream colored head that remains at a quarter inch and laces a bit for the duration of the drink. 
S- Mmmm. Rich, wonderful. Sweet malty goodness, a bit of nutmeg, some raisins, molasses, sweetbread, banana, black cherry, licorice, dried pineapple, alcohol, yeast, the smallest touch of soy sauce, and so much more, it's dizzying. One of the best smelling beers I've ever had in front of me.
T- Initially malty, followed by raisins and white bread, along with many of the same notes that I noticed in the nose. Wonderfully complex. The finish is of dark fruit and alcohol, but not unpleasant. 
M- Smooth, chewy, silky, medium carbonation, and a warming alcohol finish. perfect. 
D- Even though it's so complex, it's so good that it's highly enjoyable, and very drinkable. 872 characterskhiasmus, Jun 04, 2007
4.94/5  rDev +10.5%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I was happy to find this at a local pub - but 9$ a bottle -ouch.- It costed more than my lunch that i had with it...but it was worth it to try this one... bottle shows 10 01 12 which i guess means it is pretty fresh- I would like to try it again after aging it 6 or more months- just to see the difference in taste-except I dont know if I could resist to urge to drink it for that long.
If there is anyplace this beer is lacking it is in appearance- It looked a nice brown with a cream 1 finger head that hung around--it had a good deal of what looked like pulp in it-- but I guess those are yeast flakes..never really noticed them in any beer before-anyway those made me not want to give it a higher rating for appearance... Then the perfection started - the smell on this top notch smells fruity - definitely grapes - tastes extremely complex there must be 10 different fruits but it took me a long time with many sips to place the main taste- I think it is figs- this has to be one of the best flavor blends I have ever tasted it is not to sweet, not to bitter, not to strong, not to light...this beer is hoppy and has a good amount of carbonation and gives a almost tongue numbing effect along with the alcohol heat--- the real story of this to me was how the alcohol on this one goes right to your head---even the tiniest 1st sip and you can feel it warm up your head like a shot of whiskey would- never felt that from a beer before not even a imp stout or barley wines with higher abv--at the same time the 11.3 abv doesn't effect the drinkability in the least--it just adds heat I felt no "bite" at all like some other reviewers said-maybe its just a different batch-- drinks more like a 5 or 6% I would say super drinkable- expense is the only reason I sipped it- These monks know their stuff- the beer even seemed to have have a bit of jolly blended into it to me.. best one Ive tried for sure. wish it was sold by the case instead of the bottle.. 1,959 charactersBuffaloBill91, May 31, 2007

Aroma is ripe fruit, chalky yeast and sweet malt. There is a sweet, almost flowery characteristic as well, not the typical floral hop aroma. Taste is amazing, dark fruit, esters, and sweet malts. The finish is sharp, with a hop bite. Alcohol is present, quite spicy and very warming. There is a strong yeast character in the aftertaste. This beer is so complex its hard to pull out all the individual flavors. 510 charactersericj551, May 31, 2007
4.61/5  rDev +3.1%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5This one definitely deserves its top ten rating. I have never had a better quad, period! There may be one out there, but not one I have easy access to.
A - Beautiful rusted brown with a thick tan head. (Lasts all the way down. Heavy settlement observed when poured.
S - Very nice fruit, hops and malt smell that is not overwhelmed by high alcohol content like most quads I have tried. This is a very balanced but not overly scented beer.
T- Exceptional. Many think of this as a strong tasting beer. For its style I feel that it is incredibly smooth for a beer with a 10%+ ABV. Hops and roasted malts are fairly strong. Alcohol after-burn is highly present but does not take over the taste.
M - High carbonation and medium body. A little gassy. This one will get the burping going if you do not let it settle for a few.
D - Many say this is a sipper. I consider it more of a beer to savor!
A bit expensive, but well worth the experience. 952 charactersonehomesickalien, May 30, 2007
4.18/5  rDev -6.5%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4A - Poured a deep orange brown with an enourmous light tan head, requiring multiple pours to finish. Absolutly tons of carbonation, evident from streaming chains of bubbles. Awesome long retention reulted in significant lace. Looked awesome.	
S - Smell was insanely fruity, and filled with tons of spice and delicate aromas. Biggest apparent were aaples, grapes, pears, and fig. Smell was otherwordly though, very very good.
M & T - Wow, I had to wince it was so strong. Alot of alcohol present in this one, became a bit of a distraction to all the flavors held inside. Once you got past that there was a huge flavor profile, lots of fruit and spice with a significant amount of bitter and sour notes on the back end of it. A slight hoppy dryness in the finish, but hardly noticeable.
D - Overall this is truly the defination of a huge beer. This was really a big sipper and I struggled my way through it. It was very good, and massivly complex, however just too strong, and hot with the alcohol to truly be enjoyed right now. 1,035 charactersmikesgroove, May 30, 2007

A- Nice deep, dark, rich chocolate brown. Nice 2-3 fingers of camel colored creamy head. Nice sustained layered lacing down the glass.
S- Absolutely incredible, I poured this beauty out into a goblet, leaving the hints of sediment in the bottle, taking my nose to the bottle opening, I breathed in the amazing deep, warm, fruit induced, spicy apple bread....wow...malt, everything is balanced, not too overpowering, just right.
T- Rich, bold, creamy head, nice biting alcohol/carbonated tingle in the back of the mouth, smooth down, especially for a strong 11.3%. Once again the smells and tastes melt together with the intense, spices, caramel, malt, toasted butter nut....
M- heavy in body, but as mentioned in taste, the mouth feel brings great intensity to the throat...but finished warm and smooth.
D- This is a drinkable beer, took me about 45-50 minutes to minutes to finish one bottle, at that pace, it was just perfect...warmed up nicely and increased its smoothness.
Overall my expectations were definitely met with this one...goes down as a great Belgian.... 1,247 charactersmwagner1018, May 23, 2007
4.8/5  rDev +7.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4(UPDATE) The review below was written after I tried a very young bottle of Rochefort 10. Since then, I had the pleasure to try some aged Rochefort. No way can beer get more complex than aged Rochefort 10. Seriously, buy two bottles and keep one to store away for at least a year and a half. 
---
Reviewing these kinds of beers is so frustrating, because they are so complex in both smell and taste. 
Using a Goblet it appears to pour black, but in the light it's more of a dark brown. The head is very soapy/thick, and slighty tan in color. The lacing is like velvet and retention is phenominal. 
I smell sweet bread, with a hint of herbs, and medicine.
Just like St.Bernardus the taste is very complex, and maybe even more so for this beer. The taste is very earthy, of sweat bread, esters and herbs for sure. Warmness is there, but not overpowering. It's still a pretty smooth beer all the way through. For right now it seems to be a tie with St. Bernardus, but I will need to sit down with the two at the sametime, for a better comparison. Another winner!!!
I love the tingly attack it brings to your mouth. It almost feels like a wave of bubbly carbonation, that finally settles down to a smooth finish. Awsome!!!
Drinkability is always subjective when it comes to such strong, and complex beers like Quadrupels. So, just take your time, and enjoy every little detail of this beer. 1,404 charactersBladeRunner, May 21, 2007

I think that these Belgian ales take some time to love, but once you do , you get it, i am leaving my old review below as context:
A: still agree with below great!
S:smells like a strong red wine, berries and fruit that have been macerated are pronounced, very distinctive in the "Belgian realm"
 T: ok i must have been on crazy pills or something, this beer is very great and complex, im still not the biggest fan of belgian ales, to wine like, not "beer" enough as odd as that may sound. this beer is wine like, its sweet, smooth and delicious, i cant knock it for tasting like another beverage, its delicious my original review added up to 3.7, but i believe i was wrong and glad i dropped the money to try again this is a good beer
Ok so im not a huge belgian fan to start, but based on the hype of this beer, and others like it i was sorely dissapointed. that said it has its strong points. 
A: Strong point. nice dark wood brown color with a sticky creamy head that was great. must admit i was impressed
S: alcohol and cough syrup...not so great imo
T: also very alcohol and syrupy there are some subtle flavors maybe a roasted coffee(very faint). one thing that i can say is the flavors are layers and pop out from behind corners(so to speak) however i just didnt really liek them.
M?D: not great, i like strong beers but not a fan of this beer to be honest. obviously im in the minority so give it a try to see what you think, maybe belgians just arent for me. 1,621 charactersRedwood21, May 19, 2007
3.7/5  rDev -17.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Poured into chalice a dark mahogany with a 1/2 inch head that slowly reduces down to a thin whisp on top.
Very complex aroma but mostly I smell chocolate & caramel & some dark stewed fruits. There is also a very faint uncooked cookie dough aroma.
The alcohol comes through a lot more in the taste, as well as some spice. The malty & fruity flavours are there too.
I didn't find the mouthfeel as heavy as what I was expecting, but good none the less. Taste lingers.
Quite a decent beer but you have to be ready for the quite strong alcohol taste. This is the only thing that would put me off drinking this on a semi-regular basis. 633 charactersbrendan13, May 18, 2007
3.83/5  rDev -14.3%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Pours to a nice strong "chocolate milkshake" head, that slowly shrinks, but never disappears. The color is very dark amber with a bit of haze. Aromas of banana, alcohol, and caramel come through with a light undertone of brettomyces culture. The taste comes through to me as dark whole grain toast with some sweet, but very dark rum/molasses notes. I get a very strong yeasty flavor that I associate with homebrew. This beer is very dry, and very well carbonated. It will linger after each sip and reveal new sensations. For what it is, it is very well crafted, but I find it a bit too much for my tastes. 605 charactersJackWeizen, May 18, 2007

Pours a rich mahogany dark color that leaves a tan head that remains throughout most of the sitting.
Smell is of roasted malts. Very subtle dried fruits?
Taste is where this is always an experience. I have had about 4 of these in the past year, and I always find a different subtle note I did not remember from previous tastings, chocolate, dark, and sweet, fruits, malty, I could go for another one right now
This is a very carbonated, mouthfeel that lingers on my tongue. 
I usually try to keep two of these in my cellar at all times. 639 charactersgenog, May 17, 2007

Appearance - dark brown, thick and hazy like a broth with a bubbly head.
Smell - very fruity and lively. light malty background.
Taste - to me, it was strongly reminiscent of banana taffy, except mixed with a cognac. weird and unique flavors, would like to try another bottle to compare.
Mouthfeel - smooth, and creamy full body.
Drinkability - Easy drinking, does not feel like a 11.3 ABV at all.
Would like to try again. 565 charactersSaltyLime, May 14, 2007
4.55/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a dark brown color with a big fluffy white head.
Aromas are spicy, bright, floral, sweet, and bubblegum like. This beer has a very complex and interesting nose.
For such a huge beer, this surprisingly light in flavor, but still quite complex. Up front, the flavor is bright and crisp, with excellent carbonation noted. Beer then settles into a malty creamy backbone, with a baked apple flavor, and bready biscuit notes. Finish is tart, but also a bit sweet and dark sugary.
Mouthfeel is excellent, carbonation is about as good as it gets.
Drinkability is unbelievably good for such a high ABV beer. It is so tasty, light, yet complex, and super easy to drink. Wow... what a great beer! With that said, I still have to give a 4.5, because it is still a beast. 
This one came to me from nathan15 in the BIF race. Thanks! 839 charactersflexabull, May 13, 2007

Served at cellar temp and poured into my Olg Guardian 10oz glass.
Appearance is very good. Dark brown beer with a fluffy, thick, sand-colored head. Ton of lacing in the glass. Visually inviting.
Smell is exceptional. A lot going on here. Banana, bubblegum, walnuts, sugary malts, Belgian yeast, pepper, figs, sweet dates and ripe guava. Amazing smell.
Taste is exceptional. everything i smelled i tasted as well but with much more in the figs and sweet malt department. One of the most complex beers i've ever had. 
Mouthfeel is exceptional. Rochefort 10 dances all over the tongue and cheeks greatly. Carbonation is perfect; lively but not overly so. Finishes warming.
Drinkability is exceptional. Never has a beer with 11.3% been this easy to drink. I could drink this all night without a second thought.

Possibly my favorite Belgian beer. If you haven't had it yet, what are you waiting for? 950 charactersKingG, May 11, 2007
4.6/5  rDev +2.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Yesterday I had the 8, but today is the piece de resistance! I've been sitting on this for about 6 months, and for my birthday, I get to drink it (though 3 days late). Best by date: 10 08 10
APPEARANCE: Pours an opaque deep brown with barely any highlights. The 2-finger light beige head is large-bubbled and shrinks to a solid cap. The head now has tremendous staying power and is something to marvel at.
SMELL: What the 8 lacked in aroma, the 10 has in waves. The heat of the alcohol is very apparent but not the most prominent. Belgian malts, caramel, and especially brown sugar dominate the nose. A bit of fruitiness is present and even some citrus as it warms, but yeastiness is hard to find. Big and impressive. It lets you know you're in for one heck of a treat.
TASTE: Yeasty, dark, and powerful leads into sweet and fruity. The finish is slightly hot and dry but very clean. Truly a masterpiece. I imagine this beer as one with the strength and power of a championship fighter, yet with the dexterity and grace of a ballet dancer. Simply stunning.
MOUTHFEEL: Medium-full bodied with a perfect carbonation. The dryness at the finish is the only detractor.
DRINKABILITY: Amazing. Yes, it's obvious there's alcohol in here. You can smell it, you can taste, but you can't feel it. It's very hard to believe it's as high as 11.3%. What a wonderful beer to sit down with and relax. I'm in no hurry tonight
The monks know their stuff. There's no doubt about that. I'm incredibly thankful that I was able to drink this tonight - especially since hearing that it's becoming harder and harder to find. 1,618 charactersjmalex, May 09, 2007
4.27/5  rDev -4.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a thick syrupy dark dark dark brown, almost black. The head gets up to 1/4 inch with some good hard pouring towards the end. The head mostly goes away, but the lacing stays around and it's a good strong lacing. The smell is very sweet smelling and lots of dark fruit smell. The mouthfeel is very carbonated and the alcohol presence is noticeable, but not off putting. Flavors of candy sugar and sweet sweet plum greet you with a medium-full body. The mouthfeel is still smooth. Overall, this is a favorite friend of mine that I will have always. 551 charactersErdinger2003, May 05, 2007
4.45/5  rDev -0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Reviewed shortly after Rochefort 8. Interesting to note that 8 is 7.5% and 10 is 11.3%. Consummate quadrupel, black hole of a beer with a big foamy tan head. Only shows signs of being brown when held to light. Good retention, lacing is immaculate. Overall a marvel to look at. 
Major spicing, big dark fruit aromas, some lighter estery character and some serious alcohol featuring a phenolic bite. The yeast is soft, full, and inviting, offers up aniseed and a little bitter chocolate. 
Okay, seriously, 11% is serious business. But underneath the sharp peppery bite of alcohol is a smooth operator. Huge sweet malt (rum alcohol here), raisin flavors on the palate, smoked as well as caramelized malt, just like the 8 also has some minty dextrin action. Holy complexity, it's hard to get everything from the tongue to the internet. Full, herbal mouthfeel, offers some clove, more of the liquorice from the nose, molasses or something similar, huge warming alcohol. 
Mouthfeel is smoother and creamier than the 8, full body with high viscosity. Perfect. So rich and decadent. 
You could bring anything you want to the table with this boy, but it will bring down all but the richest of flavors. I threw some fresh Wisconsin sharp cheddar at it, cut a couple of rectangles of seriously funky Chimay cheese, and 
pulled out some aged Danish blue; none of them came close to overwhelming this quadrupel. Very impressive brew all the way around, must-try for a wide demographic of beer drinkers. 1,502 charactersBretSikkink, May 02, 2007
4.68/5  rDev +4.7%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Trappistes Rochefort 10 Quadrupel embodies all that a Belgian Ale should be. The dense tan head holds very well, leaves a nice lace and it's deep cloudy, woody-brown color possesses cider-like qualities. When held to the light red/amber highlights are revealed. 
The bouquet gives off a summery fruity (light and dark) aroma with strong hints of citrus and apple. This quadrupel has incredibly complex flavor elements including citrus, prune, date, apple, malt, molasses, vanilla, and an understated (in a good way) bitterness.
The mouthfeel is full and smooth with a nice bite and an earthy pulp like quality than makes for a very enjoyable texture. It's hard to describe just how good this beer is: phenomenal. A must try. 730 charactersletsgopens, May 01, 2007
4.4/5  rDev -1.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a deep murky brown color with a short tan head that left a solid ring as it dissipated.
The aroma is of prunes and fig and a heavy caramel scent. Almost smells buttery. Some solvent notes in the end.
The taste is bold, nice roasted malt flavor up front. Kind of has a pumpernickle breadiness, some dark cherry sweetness, earthy undertones, almost a cigar type flavor. Noticable caramel and toffee flavor going on. A bit of a boozy bite in the end.
The feel is well bodied with active carbonation, leaves a bit of a twang on the tongue. Creamy feel. Sweet on the palate though has some earthiness to it to help balance. 
A very good quad, I could be able to drink a few, though the alcohol will get me. Nice and interesting balance. 741 charactersGmann, May 01, 2007
4.58/5  rDev +2.5%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4I was quite happy to come across this one. Poors a deep cloudy mahogany, with very little light passing through and a big almost soda like head. A sweet smell with spicy and banana tones. A very complex taste that I cant even pretend to understand with a pleasant bite of alcohol. This was worth the $6 I paid for it, and certainly one of the best I have ever had. 366 charactersdickieb, Apr 29, 2007
4.25/5  rDev -4.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4The easiest of the trappist beers to find here, so why not drink one that's been cellared for a year? Pours a deep mahogany color with solid cream lacing, more brown with the end yeast sediment poured in the glass. Lots of plums, fruit, caramel, a bit hot (could cellar even longer to mellow out with no problem). Great smell as it warms. Worth the five bucks, no doubt. 370 charactersBacker2004, Apr 29, 2007
4.72/5  rDev +5.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Easily one of the best beers I've ever tasted. The price tag for this beer seems to revolve between $8 and $13, depending upon where you buy it. Despite the high price, there are times when just nothing esle will really do. I have had this beer on a number of occasions now...
The beer pours a rich, thick, luxurious dark brown color, with excellent head retention and fabulous lacing. On the nose.... oh my, where to begin. Chocalate fudge, caramel, cherries and port all combine with Belgium spice to make one exotic, incredible aroma. On the palate... mmm... so rich, so smooth... satin and silk with a heavenly mouthfeel. This beer is pretty sweet, but is not the least bit cloying IMO. The flavors replicate the nose, with lots of cherries, caramel and chocolate. This beer is very rich and very long, with a very long, lingering finish. This beer is a real sipper, which only makes sense given the abv. (which is well disguised.... you would never guess the abv. is that high) However it's so rich and viscuous, there's no way to just gulp this down. An absolute taste treat.... easily one of the 5 best beers I've ever tried. Delicious. 1,146 charactersJohn_M, Apr 25, 2007
4.7/5  rDev +5.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4As soon as I popped the cap, the beer came gushing out all over my counter. My poor wife is going to be wondering tomorrow why her kitchen towel smells like beer.
Dark brown to mahogany in color. Excellent 3 finger thick creamy tan head that holds better than duck tape. A thick sheet of lace almost covers the entire glass all the way around. This beer has a nice sophisticated look.
Brown sugar, pipe tobacco, autumn leaves, with mild spice and fruit in the aroma.
A thick and full, brown sugar malty backbone leads to a cornicopia of flavors that includes. Bananna, some smokeyness,molassas, fresh whole leaf tobacco. There's a subtle hop bitterness in the middle and a slight taste of alcohol in the finish which reminds me that this beer is 11% and I shouldn't have another bottle.
This beer taste as sophisticated as it looks. It is full of class and would be perfect to show the wine drinkers just how much class a beer can have.
I've tried St. Berny's Abt 12 and I think I like this one better. This is a bold beer in a subtle way. Blunt, but with a lot of tact.
Mouthfeel is full, creamy, smooth, dry, but with some kick to it. 
I wanna drink a few of these, but I know I shouldn't. The alcohol becomes more noticable about half way through the glass, and I started at cellar temp.
I'm afraid a lot of BA's are like me: They search thier beer stores for the newest and latest beers, and leave this one on the shelves. IMO this was a mistake. My favorite Trappist beer so far. 1,492 characterswcudwight, Apr 22, 2007
4.55/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Rochefort 10 is undoubtedly one of the finer beers in the world. I base this review off of many servings at various bars in the NY/NJ area, as well as a rare find of several bottles sealed since 1996. 
The young Rochefort is a rich, flavorful beer, slightly sweet, quite smooth, and full of wonderful flavors found in darker beers, but rarely found all in one beer such as this.
The 10+ year old version is incredibly complex and full of flavors that make you sit and ponder, trying to track all the fine tastes going through your pallette. This certainly rivals a 2004 Westvleteren 12 I had the pleasure to sip.
Ya can't go wrong with this beer and if you enjoy triples/quadrupel, consider yourself fortunate any time you find it for sale. 749 charactersdvotypka, Apr 18, 2007
4.6/5  rDev +2.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5A- Poured very slowly into a tulip. After how long I had been letting this sit, I was surprised at how cloudy this was. A very interesting looking beer to say the least. Murky brown at first glance, but upon further inspection, is more ruby around the edges. When I try and look straight through the center, it is impossible to see the other side- the only way I can describe it is a crystal ball effect. A beautiful off-white pancake of a head forms and maintains itself for the entire drinking experience.
S- Absolutely unbelievable. Some cherry, brown sugar, sweet bread, oakiness... Everything blends together so well for a very aromatically rewarding experience. I also detect some hints of fig, apple, malted milk balls, and vanilla. My mouth waters just smelling it.
T- Cherry, and sweet bread right off the bat. Some brown sugar and oak. The alcohol is definitely apparent. A little bit nutty with some associated nut bitterness. Hints of vanilla. Definitely not as sweet tasting as the aroma. Strange. Not as similar to the St. Bernardus as I remember.
M- Very smooth on the palate, but upon swallowing, the alcohol leaving a very cloying dryness to the mouth. The alcohol definetly becomes a bit numbing. I found it to be unique how the alcohol was not apparent until the liquid had been swallowed. What I originally thought was some metallic flavor to this I soon realized was just some sourness.
D- The smell and taste are enough to override the excessive alcohol dryness. I wish this was just a tad sweeter and the booze was a little more subdued... 
This is world-class for sure. I don't seem to remember the alcohol being this apparent the other time I tried it. Perhaps this could use some more time to sit. 1,738 charactersgordavidson, Apr 16, 2007
4.85/5  rDev +8.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a dark, fudgy brown color with a khaki head that leaves lots of lacing on the glass, and maintains itself in a thin cover over the liquid. Smells very rich -- chocolate, that familiar Rochefort yeast, and raw alcohol. Some faint fruit notes in the vein of figs or dates. On the palate, rich, malty mocha notes overlaid with figgy fruits, phenols and spice. The flavors are huge, refined, and are lent a boozy intensity by the raw alcohol that comes out in the mid-palate and burns through the finish. Mouthfeel is very full with alcohol, carbonation and smooth malts that are a huge step up in thickness from the Rochefort 6 and 8. Overall, this is a phenomenal beer. All the different elements are in balance, and all those elements are compelling in and of themselves. Even aspects of the beer that are normally detractions, like the raw alcohol note, contribute here positively to the overall experience. Wow. What a beer. 931 charactersgeexploitation, Apr 16, 2007
4.5/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a bottle into a Sam Adams "Super Glass". The beer poured out a hazy dark brown hazelnut color, with an orange tint and an inch of tan head. I also got a few dark brown spots in the foam from the yeasty business in the bottom of the bottle.
The smell was very interesting. I smell caramel, chocolate, butterscotch and alcohol.
The taste was fantastic and complex. I can taste caramel, chocolate, clove, and banana. I can also taste some alcohol.
The mouthfeel was somehow extremely smooth. The body seemed about medium.
The drinkability is excellent. This beer is so smooth and easy to drink. It would be easy to drink tons of this. 655 characterswestweasel, Apr 15, 2007

It's a great beer to simply sit and marvel at the complexity of flavors present. Very sweet, marlty. Hints of banana, bread, and toffee, or burnt caramel. Carbonization is moderate (less than the comparable St. Bernardus).
Don't share this one. And don't drink it fast. 329 charactersBugsey, Apr 12, 2007
3.78/5  rDev -15.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 411.2 oz. bottle poured into a fortified wine glass. 
Appearance: deep, dark amber-brown with a fluffy off-white head that clings to the glass very strongly
Smell: Smell is of red grapes, brown sugar, leather and a little currant
Taste: Taste is very smooth of red grapes and actually a quick hit of bitterness. Leather and oak are also prevelant. Linger dry flavor of leather. Alcohol is there but doesnt come through very strong.
Mouthfeel: quick spritzof carbonation but certainly not very carbonated. Very smooth.
Overall: Certainly a good beer and one of the better quadrupels i have had. Very smooth and easy to drink for the 11.3% a/c. That said, im not overly impress with this brew. I think the ridiculously high rating is a bit much and there are a lot more beers i would put ahead of it. Perhaps i just havent tasted enough beers. 855 charactersYankChef, Apr 12, 2007
4.03/5  rDev -9.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Served in a chalice, this beer pours a well carbonated head, with a pretty mahogany color topped by a latte colored foam. Aroma is fairly fruity. Taste is very interesting; fruity, raisins, but drier and slightly hoppier than expected. The strong alcohol creeps through, warming the palate. A good example of the style. 319 charactersmedic25, Apr 09, 2007
4.3/5  rDev -3.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Executive Summary: Deep, complex flavor and exemplary mouthfeel are the strong points. Hard to argue with a standard, and this is no exception. This is one of those beers you want to have around in order to impress company. Highly recommended.
Appearance: Pours a deep molasses color into my tulip with a very aggressive, fluffy khaki head that persists for quite some time at several fingers thick. Good amount of lacing.
Smell: Yeast, banana, raisins, berries, clove, alcohol
Taste: Sweet at the outset, but a tidal wave of other flavors come through. I can't even identify some of them, so here's a rundown of what I'm sensing: spicy hop flavor, bready malt, raisins, figs, alcohol. They swirl together to create a dynamic experience the likes of which I'm not sure I've ever encountered.
Mouthfeel: Moderate carbonation is quite on the mark for the style and this isn't so thick and sticky so as to be distracting. Everything about the mouthfeel serves as a reference for the style in my humble opinion.
Drinkability: It certainly has a story to tell as far as the flavor profile is concerned. I could sip this thing all night and discover nuance after nuance. Of course, after two of these, I'd also be discovering quite a loose tongue. 1,256 characterskpantz, Apr 05, 2007
4.2/5  rDev -6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured from a 33cl bottle that I shipped back from Denver since they left the Texas market. Label had a best by date in 2011. It was a cloudy dark brown with reddish tunes. The head was small but a constant carb stream kept a foam in the center throughout. The smell was heavy on plums and raisins. I saw someone describe it as port-like and would tend to agree. Was very sweet smelling and you could get hints of the ABV. The taste was also very sweet from start to finish with a little bitter at the end to tone down the sweet. The alcohol definitely comes thru in the taste but isn't too overpowering. Overall, it has a good taste and a 33cl bottle is more than enough. Anything more than that and I know the sweetness and high ABV would get to more. Pretty warm feeling as it is. Highly recommend you try it. I can see this as an annual treat for me. (4, RB, T, Y) 868 charactersTexIndy, Apr 01, 2007
4.15/5  rDev -7.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Purchased this brew in Indianapolis a year ago and forgot I put it in my cellar. Boy, am I glad I found this gem. Poured muddy brown with a tan head. The head was foamy and floating with yeast sediment. Great retention and sticky lacing left on glass. Taste as it smells, starts sweet, bold and rich in malt, dried fruit such as plums, prunes and raisins. Molasses and a strange hint of tobacco (copenhagen) in the medium. Finishing off with a bitter coffee scent and strong alcohol bite. Nice medium body with a creamy feel and lively carbonated that make easy to consume. Overall, I enjoyed this brew alot despite the tobacco scent and taste. Enjoy 650 charactersGimpyCane, Mar 25, 2007
5/5  rDev +11.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5My first beer rated as all 5's...I literally tried to find something I didn't like about this one and failed in the attempt.
Poured into a tulip glass, producing a chocolate-color infused with thick yeast particles visible along the edges. The head is tan, retained well, and sparkles. Lovin' it. Aroma is full of fruit: blackberry, banana, and honeydew. Notes of tobacco and molasses make for an amazingly aromatic boquet. 
Taste is of sweet malty notes and fruit with a touch of banana bread. The feel is smooth and subtle; you wouldn't know this thing has an 11.3% ABV without looking. An alcoholic note does pull through on the aftertaste as it warms, however, and it complements the taste. I could drink this all day if my wallet was thick enough. Hands down: a fantastic beer. 784 characterswagenvolks, Mar 21, 2007
4.97/5  rDev +11.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Pours a very deep brown color with a decent-sized head, slightly brown/tan in color, some sediment at the end. There was decent lacing left behind, but nothing extremely impressive.
A rich aroma, heavy alcohol at first, but that quickly melds into other scents: definitely raisins and other dark fruits with a hint of coffee perhaps? I'd have a hard time distinguishing this beer from a plum tree based on smell, wonderfully ripe and full of life.
The taste is heavily influenced by the dark fruits again, though not as ripe-tasting as they smelled. There is a hint of alcohol in the aftertaste, but it's very welcome and pleasing; it reminds me that I'm drinking beer. 
The alcohol warms the tongue and otherwise this is a creamy and easy to sip beer; not too heavily-bodied, but definitely not too light either. All around, a wonderful beverage and one I can't wait to try again. 884 charactersdogger6253, Mar 20, 2007

About two inches of thick, frothy, off-white head formed. Excellent retention and generous amounts of lace left on the glass. Smelled strongly of alcohol, dried dark fruits ( raisin, plum) , mollasses. This had a hell of a nose on it. Tasted again of alcohol, more dried fruits, and maybe a hint of oxidation. Was smooth up front, with a somewhat bitter, warming alcohol finish. Very tasty. Plenty of carbonation and the alcohol really shines through despite the sweetness. Very well balanced without one overpowering flavor. Pretty drinkable solid brew. A must try in my opinion. 684 charactersjaxon53, Mar 19, 2007
4.69/5  rDev +4.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Pours a dark, cloudy brown with a short, tan head.
The smell is a shot of bread with alcohol and raisins plus ripe bananas.
The taste is quite a mixture of the same things as the smell but a bit muted in comparison. It's very nicely balanced among so many malt qualities.
The mouthfeel is medium to thick with a light shot of alcohol in the finish.
Drinkability is excellent, a beer to try and sip over time to allow for so much complexity to come forward. It's strong, so one or two will do but also will be very satisying.
There's good reason this beer is highly rated in it's style, it's a great beer. 609 charactersmeatyard, Mar 17, 2007

Earthy liquorous aroma, with coffee, some chocolate, and the usual suspects: plums, raisins...Mouth is delicious and very alcoholic, warm, chocolate, the usual suspects again, brandy... Vinous and velvety, both in aroma and in mouth, but without losing that kind of roughness or unrefined quality usual in many trappist beers. Did I tell it feels vey alcoholic? 489 charactersjanubio, Mar 13, 2007

Biscuity aroma with a smooth malt follow through.
Strong alcohol hit right off the bat. Kind of overpowers the maltiness but the flavors linger on the tongue once the alcohol burns off.
Full, rich mouthfeel but less expansion of flavors than expected.
Great tasting beer but the alcohol strength means one and out for me. The time spent on one is definitely quality time. 476 charactersbgraney, Mar 11, 2007
4.43/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Appearance: Pours an opaque ruby-brown, with a fizzy and frothy head colored a light khaki. The head dissipates methodically into a ring of creamy froth resting atop a dark and austere body.
Smell: Grapes combined with a pungent earthiness that strikes a fine aromatic melange. 
Taste: Deliciously malty up front, as the palate is confronted with a mix of toasty grains, dates, and honey. The opening salvo of malty sweetness gradually gives way to a yeasty, phenolic flavor at the swallow. The alcohol is present in full force with every sip. Nevertheless, all aspects come together in a blissful deliciousness.
Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied with a delicate creaminess, followed with some invigorating carbonation. Audaciously warming on both tongue and belly.
Drinkability: Delicious without question, and well-rounded to be sure. Admirably lives up to its reputation. Among the world's finest. 903 charactersclabaugh, Mar 10, 2007

4.67/5  rDev +4.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Appearance: Dark, mahogany brown in color. Nearly opaque, but not quite. I stopped pouring as soon as I saw lots of dark sediment in the neck of the bottle. I'll pour in the floaties later. Head is modest, tan in color, and shows good retention. Little lacing, perhaps due to the high alcohol content... or my glass not being clean enough.
Smell: Belgian, spicy... Aroma is more "dry" than "sweet" - curious to see if the taste matches. Dark fruits, brown sugar and hefeweizen like aromas (bubblegum, especially) come out more as it warms. Also, boozy when it's warmed more...
Taste: Wow that's good: an explosion of flavor on the tongue. Spicy, with dark fruits (cherry?), tart. Yeast lends itself to breadiness, plenty of hops to balance the sweetness common in the style. Finishes tart and dry (highly attenuated) rather than sweet. 11.3% abv? You must be kidding. Very good.
Mouthfeel: Body is much lighter than I would have expected, I'd call it just on the light side of medium. Tingly carbonation. Warms on the way down rather than in the mouth. Creamy.
Drinkability: High, high, high. 1,104 charactershunteraw, Mar 08, 2007

It pours a ruddy murky brown color with a big creamy head. The head drapes my Chimay chalice in a coating of lace and never disappears, even after 2 hours. The aroma is doughy and sweet, with peripheral ripe berries, figs and all spice. Some alcohol kick is barely perceptable in the nose. The taste is smooth and complex. Fresh supple fruit abounds - grapes, figs, pomegranite, pear and even strawberry are detectable. A thick malt flavor and some treacly sweetness is noticeable as well. A wee bit of anise shows in the background. Fresh bread dough abounds. The finish is malty, spicey and complex, with minimal hop bitterness. The mouthfeel is thick and super creamy.
This is the third best quad Ive ever tried. 826 charactersCAMRAhardliner, Mar 08, 2007

The taste is a very nice fruit and sweet molasses flavor. Prune and raisen. Abit of brown sugar in the aftertaste and just a touch of hops.
Full body with good coating and a slick feel.

4.63/5  rDev +3.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Had a couple of these...330ml. brown glass bottle with a coded main label and a blue cap. Poured with the utmost care into a 13.5oz. crystal tulip was a dark, murky hazelnut-brown with an orange-red hue and a fluffy, uneven beige cap of a fat finger. Excellent retention, lacing and carbonation kept things alive and good looking. 
The aroma was sweet and spicy with dark fruit, alcohol, yeast, sugar and malty goodness. A little muted until it warms substantially and definetely complex.
The taste is malty dark and fruity with ripened flavors of fig, plum, red grapes, banana and a bit more. Sweet for the most part, but never gets out of hand with the supreme balance of the ingredients and the skill of the brewers, this is a truly remarkable brew. The hops don't stand out, but they do come through and the finish is pleasantly clean and warming from the high ABV.
Plenty of body with a velvety smooth as silk mouthfeel, this stuff is the cream of the crop in this dept.
A thoroughly top-notch brew that's more than drinkable...sip it, enjoy it and respect it...Cheers! 1,086 charactersscottoale, Mar 05, 2007
4.34/5  rDev -2.9%look: 3 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.511.2 FL.OZ bottle. 
The pour revealed a dissapointing head that was short lived, and wasn't the head I've come to expect with many Belgian Ale's. I did pour real slow and gentle because of past experiences with almost exploding Belgian Heads.The color is a brownish-red with yeast floating around. Complex aroma of sweet malts with fruity notes. Absolutely exceptional creamy mouthfeel for a beer this strong. Alcohol is well-hidden and has perfect carbonation with a great finish. This could be dangerous because of how easy it goes down. Finish has a dry moderate bitterness with a full body. Hops are tasted more and more with each sip thorughout half the beer. This is very drinkable and a beer not for amatuers. About 3/4 through and I'm feeling the effects of the 11.30 ABV already. This was bought at Town & Country Liquors in West Springfield,Mass. for $6.99/bottle. Overall excellent and lived up to it's reputation. 928 characterskelticblood, Feb 25, 2007
4.65/5  rDev +4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Had the 8 last night. Skipped lunch, and am having the 10 now - perhaps a mistake, but I'll enjoy the ride.
11.2 oz bottle.
Pours a murky dark brown. Did my best to keep out the sediment, but it involved leaving 3 oz or so of beer in the bottle - considerably more than I left with the 6 or 8. Enjoyed the chunky yeast-filled bottom of the bottle separately. Head was noticeably less than the 8, and didn't last nearly as long, but this is an older bottle than the fresh 8 I had last night. I've got a fresher bottle I'll try soon and give this a shot for a higher appearance score.
Nose is big on fruit and alcohol. "Port-like" was my first thought. More plum and raisin than the 8, but not as much as the 6. Lots of brown-sugary sweetness is there, but well beneath the alcohol.
Taste is different than the 8, and much more noticeable alcohol, but I can't call it anything less than great. Loads of dark fruit and some brown sugar and clove. Quite a lot of vinous qualities. A hint of bitter in the finish...if I could stand to drink (or stand up after drinking) a few of these at a time, I think I'd discover a lot more in this complex brew. Alcohol is everpresent, but it manages to be warming with a bit biting. It is never harsh - well done!
Undeniably better mouthfeel than the 8, it is in fact a damn near perfect creamy-smoothness. This beer started at a carbonation level that I only achieved with the 8 in the bottom 1/3rd of the glass. 
I feel warm all over, but only had one (fantastic) beer. Add in the price and the need to be sober enough to avoid pouring the worst of the yeast chunks into your glass, and the drinkability isn't that high. But if you are limiting yourself to one beer this evening, you can't do much better than this.
Head-to-head with the 8 I'd give the nod to the weaker beer in appearance (subject to re-review), and to the stronger beer in mouthfeel. Hard to declare a winner in the nose and taste categories, and both are extremely drinkable. 1,987 charactersudubdawg, Feb 24, 2007
4.35/5  rDev -2.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5I poured this into a nice chalice and the dark ruby beer perfectly filled it with the thick foamy head just barely pushing up over the edge of the glass. The aroma was primarily a malty sweetness, with hints of prunes and other dark fruits. The mouthfeel on this is great though. It's very rich and creamy and just slides down my throat. Most of the taste is malt and a residual sweetness as you might expect. There are also some spicy phenolic notes and the slight bite of alcohol. Overall I like this beer a lot, but I might actually be more partial to the Rochefort 8 because there isn't as much of a bite to it. 615 charactersdrseamus, Feb 22, 2007
4/5  rDev -10.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Took the bottle from the fridge and poured into a clean glass about 30 minutes later. Poured the color of root beer. Appears to be a little cloudy with some find brown sediment that settled out quickly. Nice creamy tan head that stuck around for a few minutes and left nice lacing on the glass. Sweet smelling with hints of cherries, oranges and vanilla. No real hop aroma. Medium carbonation and medium/full body. A little hint of alcohol in the taste and warming alcohol going down. Fairly well balanced with a little more malt than hops. Very nice taste. Tasted a little like a dry red wine. 594 charactersBeerCheese, Feb 22, 2007
4.13/5  rDev -7.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Pours a two finger creamy tan head, almost black, cola color. Into a tulip.
Smell is of yeast, dried fruits.
Taste is spectacular. Drenches your mouth with some of the most fantastic flavors imaginable. Nuts, raisins, molasses, chocolate, nice alcohol bite but not overwhelming. I definitely recommend drinking at the suggested temperature to discover the nuances.
Mouthfeel is extraordinary, medium bodied with light carbonation. And drinkability is through the roof. While it's a sipper, you'll have to go easy on these because they're so strong and wonderful.
Fantastic despite the price. 595 charactersSaucyA, Feb 22, 2007
4.61/5  rDev +3.1%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Served in tulip glass from bottle.
Appearance: Rough pour leaves nice thick head light brown in color. Dark brown almost black color. Strong lacing as the beer went down.
Smell: Raisins, sugar, faint alcohol. Very warm scent nice on a cold winter night.
Taste: Malty, warm, robust. Hints of chocolate and raisins. Alcohol really hits the back of the tongue. This beer is a joy over the whole tongue. 
Mouthfeel: Medium body thats is nice and smooth. 
Drinkability: Not going to have more than one of these in a sitting. A beer for a cold night that needs a bit of warming. Sip on this bad boy and enjoy the flavors as the beer warms a bit. Tasty. 661 charactersmuffguy4beer, Feb 22, 2007
4.97/5  rDev +11.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Pours a hazy dark reddish-brown color with a mountainous fluffy beige head that coats the walls of the glass with webs of sticky lace as it slowly recedes. The nose is quite fruity with notes of apricot, pear, banana, apple, and star fruit. A bit of brown sugar, cinnamon, cake, and brandy round out the complex aroma. Taste begins sweet with dark malt and a bit of candied sugar followed by notes of fruitcake and cherry liqueur and a hint of cocoa. The texture is almost a perfect creamy smoothness. An immensely complex drink and one of the true gems of the beer world. 572 charactersMorris729, Feb 19, 2007

S: Figs, prunes, spicy, apperantly a small amount of coriander is added at the end of the boil.
T: Spicy, vanilla and fig appearnces, slight date-like sweetness. Alcohol very present, warming in mouth and on the way down. Taste to me sort of like the muscular adolcent love-child of Westmalle dubbel and triple.
M: Spritzy due to high carbonation, each sip is like a burst of flavour and energy. Not thick or heavy at all.

Into a St Bernardus tulip glass, pours a dark dark russet brown, a lovely foamy inch thick head, settling down to a nice foam, good lacing that dosnt' stick to the glass, very nice. Aroma is the strength here, just perfect. Dark fruits, sweet sugars, plum, spices, brandy, maybe a bit of bourbon, very deep, very complex, very enticing. Taste... it could use a year, but nearly perfect, with flavors mirroring the nose, a classic. The mouth is very nice, a subtle alcohol warming, man I really could have another, but drinking multiple bottles of Rochefort is simply dangerous, so I'll cellar my others. A classic, worth every penny. 674 charactersobjectivemonkey, Feb 07, 2007
4.4/5  rDev -1.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4I'm glad I waited until this point in my beer advocacy to review this wonderfully complex beer  frankly, I couldn't have done it justice even a few months ago.
It poured into my goblet a dark cola colour with ruby highlights. Tiny bubbles made up a compact, creamy one-finger head that left sheets of lace. Smells of cinnamon, prunes, brown sugar, rum and powdery yeast wafted up from my glass.
The first sip of this beer is always sharply alcoholic but always incredibly smooth after that. Carmelized sugar, raisins and blackcurrants play off a rummy booziness that is gentle and warming and not indicative of this beer's high ABV. A yeasty flavour reminds the drinker that this is still very much beer.
Tiny bubbles play nicely on the palate  lively, but not abrasive. The finish is slightly sticky, but overall this beer goes down incredibly smooth.
I've never had Westvleteren 12, but it must truly be great to be considered a peer (or a superior) to this beer. 981 charactersvanrassel, Feb 02, 2007
4.72/5  rDev +5.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Pours a dense, deep brown with ruby highlights and a modest head that leaves a small cap.
Marvelous fruity smell; plum and raisin seem most evident. High ABV evident, but not overwhelming.
Taste is malty, sweet, and fruity. A very complex brew with smooth finish containing some pleasing bitterness.
Coats the mouth, but feels light at first and gains some heaviness on the finish.
Drinkability isn't bad either. The alcohol is well hidden, so tolerance would seem to be the limiting factor here. 508 characterstechdiver, Feb 01, 2007

Making this bottle 5 years old, being kept properly cellared for 4 years
Smell is fine, very fruity, I smell almost nothing else
Taste is Grand, very fruity, sweet, a tad malty. Simply put, this is so very smooth. All I taste is complex fruitiness, all tied together with the hop(s) and yeast. Words don't do this justice. I taste no alcohol, seriously. I've had grape juice that was harder than this.
Overall, I have many more of these in my cellar, and if this hasn't already peaked, or is past it's prime, I don't think I could comprehend this brew at it's zenith. Very well done, age has made this one a thing to worship. 707 charactersleftmindedrighty, Jan 31, 2007
4.62/5  rDev +3.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Served in a snifter, it pours brown with some ruby red tints and it has some sediment floating around the glass, along with a small tan head. This is a very good smelling beer, I can smell bananas, plums, molasses, brown sugar, toffee and chocolate. It tastes like dark fruit, bananas, molasses and a bit nutty. It starts off sweet, and then has a lingering bitter finish. Mouthfeel is medium/full, and it's smooth and creamy. Drinkability is good too, it's very easy to drink although the high ABV starts to catch up to me after a little while, but the alcohol isn't as noticable as you'd think it would be. Overall I think this is a pretty good beer, I'd definitely buy it again. 681 charactersbluejacket74, Jan 28, 2007
5/5  rDev +11.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5So what makes a beer perfect? Could there ever be such a beer? Dare I award such a high rating?
I don't go around awarding perfect fives to just anything and I probably won't do it again. The Rochefort Trappistes 10 is worthy, completely. This beer didn't happen by accident. It's obvious that it was brewed with great care and deliberate work. 
The taste is more than smooth and even. It's both complex and balanced at the same time. The taste is sweet without being candylike, and when served in the proper glassware, the velvet aroma mixes with the flavors seamlessly. 
There have been plenty of Trappistes Rochefort 10 reviews here and they're all worth reading. All I can add is that when you experience this beer you immediately know that you've poured something special. It's world-class, perfect, and worthy of this rating. You will not be disappointed. 870 charactersRoundelMike, Jan 27, 2007
4.87/5  rDev +8.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5This beer could easily take an hour to drink...
Pours into a snifter with the appearance of unfiltered, dark, clover honey. The lingering substantial head was light brown, almost burnt orange in some lights. Said to be one of the strongest beers in Belgium, I could easily smell this beer for a hour...and enjoy every second of the strong banana bread nose with hints of malt and strawberry. An incredible combo of ripened banana and sweet malt warms you as it finishes remarkably with mild black pepper notes (Normally I might not be thrilled with a black pepper description, but the softness and complexity of the taste is fantastic). The mouth feel was heavy, as you might expect of a quad, but the smoothness throughout this huge beer is what solidifies it's "5" status for me. Indicative of the style, flavorful cheeses thrive when paired with this beer. I enjoyed it with a plate of gorgonzola ravioli, using a fairly neutral butter herb sauce so the cheese shines through....of course one could pair it only with a little Port Salut cheese, and be in for a terrific night...Enjoy 1,089 charactersGreenfloyd, Jan 24, 2007
4.67/5  rDev +4.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pouring a deep and glorious brown, the head dissipates quickly but sticks to the edges of my Leffe glass with much appeal. 
While there's a distinct alcohol smell, the aroma is brilliantly detailed. Plum and fig make up part of the picture, but rich malt with cherry and chocolate come through the strongest.
While drinking, you're privy to a delightful warmth and the taste of all what was smelt after pour. I have a soft spot for malt-heavy brews, and this is indeed one, but not enough so to unbalance the near perfect delivery of the flavoursome bouquet.
The aftertaste is dry and spicy, and as the warmth mellows all the wonderful chocolates and fruits come back into play before their final departure.
Another high-quality Belgian brew, quite honestly the best I've ever had, but unfortunately at AUD $14 a stubby, I will have to reserve this one for very special occasions. 892 charactersrec, Jan 24, 2007
4.37/5  rDev -2.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Appearance: Barely any light passes through, but the brew is clearly a brown with yellow hightlights. Head is an off white, lacing leavesa sticky ring on the glass, very thin layer of bubbles on the top.
Smell: Sweet malt, molasses, dark chocolate, black coffee, very aromatic. Also some cheese smell, like an aged cheddar.
Taste: Mimics the smell, but with a fairly intense alcoholic warmth. Also a little more spicy, coriander, cloves.
Mouthfeel: Smooth, medium bodied, coats the mouth but finishes clean as well, light carbonation.
Drinkability: Delicious as expected, more alcoholic than other Quadrupels I've tried, but tasty. This one just lets you know you can't drink too many of them. 705 charactersguitarmage, Jan 22, 2007

 A puposely sloppy pour produces a murky dark liquid with a tall light brown head of foam that takes minutes to droop and coat the goblet in sugary lace. Grainy sedement from the dollop of yeast dregs I decided to add, detracts from appearence but lends a little character and depth.
Ripe fruit and yeasty phenol aromas pour off the beer when swirled. Smokey undertones along with flavors of chocolate and rasins, sweet brown bread and berry pie. Hop bittering and flavor take a balanced but respectfull backseat to the malt / yeast love affair going on in this beer. Sumptuous and subtle, complex and refined with layer after layer of flavor.
Mouth feel is slick and hefty but not heavy. Its hard not to call this full bodied as the barrage of flavors coats your entire mouth, but it doesnt overpower in any way. On the contrary , its so drinkable you can take large gulps and fight your self to not swallow. Alcohol is always lingering in the background but is so completely folded into the beer it is only really noticable as a mild burn in the long, warm finish.
Absolutely outstanding strong Belgian ale. 1,228 charactersShiredave, Jan 21, 2007

Medium in body. Really pleasing in flavor, mouthfeel, and aroma. One sip invites another, making this one one of the most drinkabile, and quite possibly the best Quadrupel I have ever had. 493 charactersMrHurmateeowish, Jan 20, 2007

Taste starts out with prunes, cinammon, stewed fruit, and progresses to a delicious yeasty taste, brown sugar and a late hit of spicy hops. Absolutely wonderful. The mouthfeel is wonderfully creamy and smooth, with no discernable alcohol, especially considering the whopping 11.3% abv. Tremendously drinkable.

The beer is a dark brown color and there is a nice creamy head. When the beer is rolled around inside my Chimay glass it leaves the glass entirley coated with lacing which enevntually slides back into the brew. The smell is of plums and raisins and there is also alcohol presence. The taste is Again, fruit like and somewhat nutty. The mouthfeel is bittersweet and the alcohol shows up here as well. I could have this beer again on occasion. A nice beer to sip will certainly warm you up. 598 charactersEnola, Dec 31, 2006
4.65/5  rDev +4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5I poured this beer too cold, but as it warmed, my oh my, did the taste explode. I didn't want to finish it, it was that good. It poured very, very dark (even held up to light it was difficult to see the yeast particles dancing). It fizzed quite loudly and suddenly into the glass, but on the first taste, as I braced for carbonation overhaul, surprisingly found the carbonation no more than a beautiful dancing upon the tongue. Magic, friends, pure magic. And the tastewell, as it warmed the taste grew in complexities that I cannot dare to describe. Sweet dates and figs dance upon the palate, but the sweet taste did not overwhelmneither did the bitter kick. I am quite partial to that bitter kick, but did not miss it here in favor of the amazing taste of this ale. Highly drinkable, only be careful friends, as the unnoticeable alcohol creeps up and by the end of only one glass I was surprised by the pleasant buzz. 924 charactersuncle8gil, Dec 29, 2006
4.69/5  rDev +4.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Vintage 1999
Pours dark chestnut with an off-white head of medium density.
Retention of less than two minutes before receding to a ring of foam and a whisp on the surface. A few dots of lacework remain, but not curatins.
Aromatics are remarkable, with rummy toffee notes, vanilla, and juicy raisins. Alcohol is evident and spicy on the nose.
Dark fruits and nougat finish the aroma, with a vineous nod.
Mouthfeel is lightish for the style, amazingly dry for such a large beer. Carbonation is subdued, but enough remains to crisp up the mellowed character.
Pallet is moderately boozy, with figs steeped in dark rum.
The yeast lends a spicy but balancing complexity, with hints of allspice and anise. 
Classic bubblegum notes run underneath the malty, caramelish flavors, with a lingering warmth on the back of the throat.
Remarkably lacking in oxidation or fusels, and in exceptional condition for almost eight years old.
Wow. 937 charactersbrewandbbq, Dec 29, 2006

4.02/5  rDev -10.1%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3Standard bottle decanted into a large port glass since I'm sans snifters just now. Color is deep ruby brown, impenetrable except at the edges where a touch of light shows through. The sticky ecru head is durable but a bit thin, perhaps owing to an overly gentle pour. Slightly leathery, prune-raisin dried fruit aroma, mild hints of chocolate and whisky-like phenols. The first sips start fizzy and sweet, evolving into a phenolic bite and prominent alcohol warmth, turning into almost a sting in the aftertaste. As I let it warm and breathe a bit, the carbonation mellows and some port, sherry, oaky flavors come through. Still, the bitey aspect at the end of the sip sticks around, and I wonder if it's actually something to do with the grain (like a lot of Biscuit malt).

Pours a dark amber...not black, but very dark with a nice single finger head that melts to a good quarter inch of continually sticky lacing.
Aromas are all Belgium....yeasts, sweet amber malts, and yes, alcohol.
Flavor is completely balanced between sweet amber malt, bready yeast, dark fruits, hops, candy sugar and alcohol. Nothing dominates...everything blends together perfectly without losing individual identifying properties.
Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with a perfect amount of carbonation and aftertaste is "simply Belgium"...all that was there in the original tastes is there in lesser amounts until you take another sip.
World Class?
Definately. 717 charactersIntriqKen, Nov 29, 2006
3.86/5  rDev -13.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Whoa, wait a minute  my 1890 crystal snifter is showing a murky and dark oak pour. Frothy ivory head that settles into a fine ring olace. Lots of yeasty goodies await on the bottom  GET IT!
Lots of caramel and Belgium spices in the sniff, but the quaff  what a letdown. Just your basic notes of sugar cane, molasses and Belgium yeast. Certainly, its tasty, but at $8 a 11 ozer, Im expecting more eye-opening flavor.
Im glad I tried it, its good  but you can get this, or better tasting brews at a much better price, here in the good ol USA. 564 charactersVancer, Nov 24, 2006
4.33/5  rDev -3.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4What a fantastic beer. Had a bottle of this at Smokeless Joe. The bartender recommended the Rochefort 8 to go with the clam chowder I was eating, but I'd had the 8 before and wanted to try this one out instead. Got a good tasting done before digging into the soup.
Poured a brownish gold, with very little head but lots of lacing as I swirled it. Aroma was apparent even in a reasonably crowded bar from a few feet away. Glassware was a little unusual (smallish glass), but OK.
Aroma is somewhat alcoholy, with a lot of caramel, nuttiness, and some very mild dark fruit. Some roasted malt as well.
Flavour is just fantastic, and only emphasized by the perfect (IMO) mouthfeel. Smooth, but not too oily. Some mild alcohol presence in the flavour, but mostly powerful malts (toasted), chocolate, a little bit of coffee, and some mild berry or cherry notes. Aftertaste is muted, and avoids any cloyingness it might have had from the flavour.
Excellent, excellent beer, and worth the price. 998 characterscrwills, Nov 20, 2006
4.43/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.512oz bottle from Corridor Wine and Spirits in Laurel, MD. Poured in a Chimay chalace (two pours).
Pours a translucent dark brown (almost coffee) with almost 2 fingers of head. Staying power with the head, but lots of lacing.
Smells a bit alcoholy. Maybe some malt, something sweet.
Tastes a smooth sily sweet, maybe malty. Alcohol bite at the end, nice for the style. Long lasting taste, I cant figure out the spice in it. Almost tastes like saffron to me.
Mouthfeel is the best I could imagine a beer to be. This is what I want out of drinking beer. Feels like a party in my mouth where I am the guest of honor. I could drink(sip) this all day.
Wish this was cheaper than $5.5us/12oz. My absolute favorite. Matter of fact, I think this is in a different league of any beer Ive ever had. 802 charactersJasonA, Nov 19, 2006
4.6/5  rDev +2.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5L120711, 07:49. Poured into a goblet. Impressive head (especially for the abv) which is randomly stained brown and red. 
The nose is full of sweet malts, sugar, and booze.
Quite a range of flavors are flowing out of every inch of this beer...sweetness from the massive amount of malts, and definite candi sugar in there. Don't get me wrong, the sweetness is tastefully restrained and never cloying or overbearing. The alcohol is there for sure, but it too plays a delicate role. The carbonation adds a gentle zip. Cigarette ashtray notes are in there. All these rich malts and barely any hops almost reminds me of a dopplebock.
This is the 4th quadrupel I've had yet; the first two I had, La Trappe and Weyerbacher, I found too rich, and I hadn't touched a quad since then. But, I've recently decided to explore the style after having my first Westy 12. It was great, but what blew me away was how drinkable it was. 
This beer was every bit as great. It was exactly what I was looking for tonight, the very definition of the style. It's a hand-crafted work of art with the finest attention to detail. Now I have 3 more quads waiting on deck, can't wait to crack into them! I highly recommend this beer to all. Cheers! 1,229 charactersrayjay, Nov 15, 2006

Pours chestnut with a 2 fingers deep tan head& in to my Vondel glass. An oily appearance is apparent as it warms. Begins to murk up a bit at the end, with some floaties. A hint of lacing & some film on the head
S: Chocolate, booze & pralines. Then whisky & caramel (scorched)
T: Sweet woody flavor, then chocolate, booze & then dryness up front. Fruittyness& candy sugar follows, a little brown sugar also. Woodyness, toffee flavors & dryness in the finish ( oh yeah more warming on the edge of burning alcohol)
MF: Low carbonation & slightly prickly feel from all the alcohol. 
Good drinkablility for the 12% abv, reminds me of a brandy. Very complex beer, but probably needs a few more years to completely round out. Enjoyed it, just a little too boozy for me 843 charactersrusspowell, Nov 10, 2006

Smells of a spiced plum that has had a few too many drinks, fruity with a hint of spice and alcohol. The taste is unbelievable the 11% ABV was not as noticeable as I thought it would be. This one has complex flavor sweet malts, fruits, hops and a hint of alcohol burn, very delicious! Mouthfeel is full with good carbonation. The drinkability is dangerous on this one with the ABV but I found myself wanting another one! Best Rochefort of the bunch! 507 charactersSudNut, Nov 09, 2006

It pours a dark cola color with a thick, picky finger head. The heads laces all over the glass. The aroma is sweet: plum and brown sugar. A nice crisp yeast scent balances the sweetness. The flavor is extremely complex. Initially the sweetness hits, similar to the nose. It continues with the slightest sour notes - green apple and dark cherry. Just a tiny bit of bitterness finishes. There's a lot going on here and it all comes together wonderfully. Incredibly delicious, the 11.3% ABV is hardly noticeable. I enjoyed this as an after dinner beer but it certainly would do well with many cuisine options. 675 characterssloejams, Nov 08, 2006

S: Very strong in the nose. Crisp green apples and a nice sugary malt with hints of orange peel and cinnamon. Plum, apricot and fig linger. Very pleasant.
T: A tart bite followed by a nice sugary sweetness. Raisins and brown sugar. Tastes lighter than it looks. The alcohol is definitely noticeable and is complemented quite well between the tart fruit and sweet malt. 
M: Just about perfect for me. Light and sufficiently full with a crisp but bubbly, champagne effect. Very nice.
D: This is a very drinkable Belgian. You can definitely taste and feel the alcohol but for such a high ABV the quaffability is superb. I could easily down a bomber of this beer on my own over a meal. Its so light and sweet. Really a pleasure. A little pricey, but probably worth having again for a special occasion. 907 charactersuberabr, Nov 03, 2006
4.65/5  rDev +4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Seemed like a good beer to counteract all the paganism going on tonight.
appearance: Upon pouring off of the sediment into my favorite beer glass, a 1" light khaki head is produced. Nice head retention after the initial recession and some light lacing is left behind. The beer is a deep chesnut or rich tobacco color.
smell: At first smell I find notes of dark berries, but in a more malty, less fruity kind of way. A slight note of wood that has been impregnated with tobacco smoke. Aged, subtle Belgian hop aroma. Just a touch of hazelnut chocolate. Candied fruits and varied sugars. The touch of ethanol present is a boon to the aroma. Light notes of quality brandy. A very subtle macerated strawberry note and maybe a floral hint of pollen or honey.
mouthfeel: The carbonation is high, but very smooth. The body is a full medium, the weight of which is greatly hidden by the carbonation.
taste: Wonderfully complex, I don't even know where to begin. The same berrylike maltiness from the nose is present and seems to be a blend of currant with some lighter notes of blueberry. I don't mean to give the impression that the beer is fruity, because it isn't. Moderate notes of flavored, sweet tobaccos are found. Aged, papery hop flavor with a light bitterness that partially dries the finish. Very subtle yet flavorful, and quite confounding when it comes to describing what I sense. A touch more ethanol is found on the tongue than in the aroma.
drinkability: The ABV is expertly tempered. A great beer.
Cellard about a year, or maybe a few months less. The beer is marked as best by 06-07-10 (Euro style, day first), so I guess it's about one or two years old now. 1,686 charactersblackie, Nov 01, 2006
4.62/5  rDev +3.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 330ml brown botle into a Duvel goblet. The label has a date and time stamp, but I am not sure how to read it. Too bad, as I bought a couple of these and would like to age them.
Appearance: Pours a medium brown color with a half inch off white head. The head stayed around for the whole beer and left a small amount of lacing. The beer is pretty clear, but there is a lot of sediment in the bottom. If you don't like floaties (and I mean chunks) make sure you decant this one. I poured a little bit of the sediment in on accident, but I don't think it really adversely affected the flavor.
Smell: A strong mix of sugary sweetness, alcohol, and herbs. It almost smells like some herbal teas, a very pleasant aroma.
Taste: An amazing blend of flavors. Smooth at first, with a strong sweetness in the middle, followed by just a slight bitterness. You really notice the use of the famous Belgian candy sugar here. The sweetness is a much deeper flavor than that you would find from standard white table sugar.
Mouthfeel: Great body, just bursting with flavors. A decent level of carbonation. Even after a hard pour and much swirling around, there was a noticeable bite.
Drinkability: I wish I had more than 11.2 ounces of this stuff! I know the alcohol level is high, but this is definitely one I would want to have a few more of. A great beer that lives up to the hype. 1,394 charactersbeveritt, Oct 31, 2006

S: A slew of wonderful and rich aromas meet the nose; dark fruits, sweet brown sugar, fresh bread and yeast, sweet malts, a touch of liquorice.
T: Nearly divine. Dark fruit flavors of plumbs and pears meet with sweet malt and mild dough. Afterthoughts of caramel and grain. The essence of leafy smoke. Nice.
M: Mild on the palate, and velvety smooth.
D: Pretty good. This would be a bad-ass winter warmer to have each evening if it weren't so expensive.
Notes: One of the better Quads. Not quite as good as St. Bernardus, but definitly on it's level. 668 charactersFrozensoul327, Oct 31, 2006

Trappistes Rochefort 10 was a hazy red-brown color with a light tan head. The head was thick and had decent retention, eventually becoming a thin ring. The aroma was fruity (raisins and prunes), malty, and alcoholic. The taste was port-like with dried fruit and dark malt flavors. The finish is long, dry, and throat warming. It is medium to full bodied with fairly low carbonation. Drinkability is excellent. Overall this is an excellent beer with lots of great flavors and very smooth considering the high alcohol. This beer definitely needs to served at the proper temperature. 601 charactersafinepilsner, Oct 30, 2006
4.92/5  rDev +10.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Good, uniform tan head that lasts. Thick dark and muddy, the way a dark strong should be. Blackberry and currant aroma and a strong estery, sweet taste with a steady hop bitterness going through to the finish. A tingle of alcohol which is acceptable and expected in this style with that high of abv. Smooth mouthfeel but not too thick or cloying. Excellent cleansing finish, in part due to the hops, partly from the dryness of the alcohol.
My favorite of the Trappist dark strongs. I'd love to cellar some. 509 charactersCH3CH2OH, Oct 29, 2006

Aroma: You can smell the alcohol, pepper. Very Nice
Taste: Peppery taste, you can very much tasted the alcohol also. Leaves a good flavor in you mouth
Mouthfeel: Very smooth, I had to take moderate drinks to taste all of the flavor, gulps caused me to taste too much alcohol.
Overall: Poured into a pint glass. Very neat beer, I think overall it is a very good beer, I don't think it is something I can drink a lot of at once. But something I can drink once again for special occasions. 660 charactersjazappi, Oct 20, 2006

Overall a very good beer. Poured a nice dark color with a minimal head. High in abv, but that was difficult to detect. Sweet. 
I'm not familiar with the Belgian beers, this is different from most things I'll drink. But it's definately got me leaning towards searching out some more Belgians! 483 charactersBones54, Oct 19, 2006
4.42/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Best before 7/10
Pours out a nice very dark leathery tan with a big fluffy tan head sitting on top.
Smell. Very sweet of fruits- prunes, plums, and a banana creaminess. Is just slightly peppery; the sweetness overwhelms it. Just so creamy.
Taste. An explosion of flavors- first starts off a touch peppery with alcohol and slightly yeasty. A light tartness then comes out with alcohol soaked fruits- cherries and plums stick out the most. Not as heavy as i remember it to be. After a fwe seconds I get a nice creaminess and taste of butter icing. Finishes dryer then it starts off to be and slightly warm and peppery. hides the 11.3% alc. very nicely.
Mouthfeel. Full for the style. Very creamy, despite the carbonation being very present and lively (but not as much as other quads).
Overall. An incredible beer! Flavor is much more delicate than i remember and lighter. So creamy and flavorful though. I hear the Rochefort vs. St. Bernardus debate; my side is that Rochefort is slightly more complex on flavor, but Bernardus has a better flavor. I still choose the Bernardus. 1,090 charactersacrawf6, Oct 18, 2006
4.7/5  rDev +5.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Color: Brown withhints of copper, dark cream colored head. With small bubbles. Head pours high and slowly settles leaving some lacing.
Nose: Spices and bread dough sit just above the surface of giant caramel and complex fruit notes including pears, apples, cherries, plums and a hint of dates, smoke, sweat and a hint of old band-aid with a very slight generic plastic note. These notes that sound more negative are really pretty good here in the small quantity that they are present. I probably won't smell them at all when this warms up a bit.
Taste: Everything and more shows up on the taste the alcoholic heat pulses its way through in elegant waves bringing up the spiciness with each surge and as the wave dies down it shows more woody/smokey dark sugar notes or lighter fruit notes alternately. Surprisingly mouthwatering. I really didn't notice any trace of band-aid or plastic flavor in the taste, which was a very good thing.
Body/Drinkability: Medium light bodied beer that is vey drinkable. 1,011 charactersxymyl, Oct 16, 2006

Pours a chestnut brown with a fluffy 2 finger head, nice longevity and lace. Lots of sugary malt smells with a hint of roasted malts. Brown sugar and dried dark fruit smells as well. Alcohol is present but not as mush as I got in the 8. upon drinking, I got an abundance of sweet malts up front mixed with brown sugar and dried fruits, a bit of roasted malts too. A decent hop bitternedd in the aftertaste and a roasted coffee like taste in the finish. Alcohol is present but it seems to blend better in the 10 than the 8. Creamy and smooth. A damn fine beer. 647 characterssabrills70, Oct 15, 2006

Taste is sweet, somewhat medicine like and very rich and complex. It's exceptionaly smooth and creamy and very easy to drink considering it is 11.3%. All in all it's a pretty well rounded beer.
Mouthfeel is full and sticky.
This beer is a work of art. It is not my style but it is an incredibly well crafted beer. The drinkability is amazingly high for such a strong beer. 531 charactersles1721, Oct 13, 2006
4.27/5  rDev -4.5%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Appearance: This was a little disappointing... little to no head and carbonation, but what was there was pretty. The body was dark brown/purple and the head was vanilla colored.
Smell: Very sweet candy like smell, with alcohol and some coffee notes.
Taste: This was more coffee alcohol, kinda like a brandy with the sweetness of the candy. It was fruity, but I couldn't discern a specific type of fruit. There was a hint of citrus and a hint of deep sweet fruit character. It was very complex, and very rewarding to sip.
Mouthfeel: The body was a perfect thickness, a little heavier than what I would consider "medium", and the alcohol added depth, but overall, not as interesting as the taste.
Drinkability: I will probably have this again, and it's one of the most drinkable quads I've experienced. I can only imagine it improving if the alcohol that adds to the taste and mouthfeel, subsides a little bit. 920 charactersdbalsock, Oct 10, 2006
4.67/5  rDev +4.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5My new favorite Quad. What a dreamy sweet mother of a brew! 
Pours a luscious dark amber, nice off white head, great lacing and chunks of white sediment swirling around the glass.
Smells of sweet candy, caramel, dark fruits, raisins, figs.
Taste is so perfectly smooth, sweet, clean, it's poetry in a glass. The dark fruits dominate and the alcohol warms so nicely in the finish. Slight peppery twang, cloves, sweet malt goodness. Damn, I love this one. 
I could sip this one till I pass out. The carbonation is so mild it just slides down so easily. I'm in love. 573 characterskirok1999, Oct 09, 2006
4.28/5  rDev -4.3%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 3Even a slow pour of this one fills my St. Bernardus chalice with a good 2.5 inches of foam. Well. The huge, massive toasted marshmallow head is most impressive, composed of big foamy bubbles. It settles after about 10 minutes, leaving great clumps of foam on the sides. Tons of yeasty bits too, this may be the most sediment rich beer Ive encountered. The beer itself is a deep tobacco color, opaque and rich, with white yeast suspended in all levels of the beer.
Like any good Trappist, theres lots to smell here. I get loads of dark fruits, raisins, dates, figs, rum and alcohol. After all that, theres still Belgian yeast, caramel, cocoa and a distinct tannic red wine smell. The only unpleasant aspect is a phenolic band-aid tone that seems a bit off. Theres much fun to be had with this one, but let it warm a bit first.
The taste is really wild. The alcohol in this one is VERY pronounced, and burns the back of my throat a bit. As youd expect, its also quite warming. The taste is quite dry, again reminiscent of a red wine. Past the dry alcohol is a very malty ale, heavy on the candy sugar sweetness. Theres an earthy quality to this one, and a cocoa flavor as well as a real roasty, grainy streak. I get raisins, figs, and perhaps a touch of citrus  no other hop presence is evident. To sum up: Complex, alcoholic, and rich.
Mouthfeel: Quite dry, yet creamy and rich. The little yeasty bits (we need an official name for these) give the impression Im drinking a very natural beer, which is most likely the case.
Rochefort 10, while incredibly tasty, isnt the sort of thing Id reach for on a regular basis. The alcohol is a bit overwhelming, and I wouldnt dream of having more than a single glass of this in a blue moon  never mind the $6 price per 11.2oz bottle! This is something to savor, and is special precisely because its so complex. Give me one every few months and Id be quite satisfied. Do yourself a favor and crack one on your birthday like I did! 2,014 characterskkipple, Oct 09, 2006

However this one is quite unique, from what I have found this is a true trappist beer that puts all others to shame. I drank this beer this past summer, a friend gave it to me to try. The beer was dark in color and had an awsome sweet smell to it. The beer was very drinkable, especially for being a strong beer.

4.67/5  rDev +4.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured from a 330ml bottle into my new Trois Pistoles goblet.
Appearance - Pours with a thing one-finger tan, creamy head. This quickly dissipates to a thin layer of lace (thick toward the edges). The beer is a very dark and murky brown, with some floaties here and there.
Smell - Spicy alcohol on the nose, with a dry powdery yeast smell. Sweet and dark ripe fruits are heavy in the aroma, with obvious notes of fig, plum, and some cherry. A very rich and hearty smelling bread-pudding like malt aroma. Strong earthy tones (probably from the conditioning?).
Taste - Spicy alcohol right away. A peppery/clove spiciness is present. Cherry, fig, plum again make up the fruit character, with traces of anise and some nuttiness. Light sweetness from caramel and molasses. The aftertaste has strong earthy flavors with some lingering malt traces. A rich, buttery/bready malt character tie it all together. A strong warming alcohol is felt throughout.
Mouthfeel - A bit too much carbonation for such a dark and solid beer, but still decent. I personally find a strong carbonation bite to be very unpleasant for strong dark Belgian ales. And the bite on this beer lasts into the aftertaste! However, carbonation bite notwithstanding, the beer is incredibly smooth and has a luciously full-body.
Drinkability - Very strong flavors tied with a very noticeable alcohol definitely dock points from this category.
A very good trappist ale. Not my favorite of the trappists, but probably one of my favorite Belgian brews in general. Highly recommended. 1,557 charactersdblinkhorn, Oct 05, 2006
4.4/5  rDev -1.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Poured aggressively into Chimay chalice, immediately a huge whiff of chocolate brownies. This one has a nice thick off white head with thick luxerious lacing. Its a deep musty brown color with some floaty yeast hanging out around the bottom. I assume this could be avoided with some foresight, but I dont mind. Smells like a punch in the face nessled between lushes medieval breasts. It smells of toffee, chocolate, banana (not in the way a tripel smells of banana, but as in a real banana) hints of raison, vanilla, Belgian yeast, maybe a tinge of hops if you really search for it, and sort of a sherry sent. The taste is milky, slinky, some mild bitterness, a complex richness that coats the mouth, with sweetness and a finish of young bananas. This is a monster of a beer, one must be careful or it will kick your ass. This is a great food beer; maybe some pot roast or stew, but take it slow, this is not a beer you want to close a session with. I will definitly buy this again.. Thanks Rochefort for making my night. 1,025 charactersmmcave, Oct 05, 2006
4.77/5  rDev +6.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5A 33cl bottle as a gift from my son on his girlfriend's birthday ( ! ! ! ). Poured a bit too cold, I believe, so I let it warm a bit before drinking.
A slow pour into my tulip glass produces a small tight head over a hazy opaque walnut-brown body. Pretty. I think I'll pour the next one a bit quicker though, hoping for a larger head.
The aroma is what knocked me down -- you can smell this from across the room, and it's lusciously malty and nutty with dark fruits like raisins, figs, and prunes over a vinous almost grapey foundation. Rich dark rye bread. Mmmm. Hope it tastes this good, because this may be the best smelling beer I've ever nosed.
Wowowow what a taste! Richly vinous symphony of warming notes up front, with malt and raisins, walnut chewiness and a bold spiceyness. Just enough hops to leave a dry finish to the sweet warm malt and spice middle. Very complex. There's a LOT going on here. A LOT!
Mouthfeel is a bit thinner than I anticipated from the smell. However, this is a quadrupel, not a RIS or a Doppelbock. Still pretty round.
Drinkability? This is really quite strong, but so smoooth and spicey and malty, so it's perilously drinkable for a quad. 
What a great beer. Really fine. Gotta have some more. 1,247 charactersColoradoBobs, Oct 05, 2006

S - well lets see...first off, fruity aromas...sweet banana like smell..also raisins, and a roasted coffee smell?
T - raisin, banana, plum flavors, and all of the sudden im getting a hint of roasted coffee/cocoa?? incredibly complex. i was giggling like a schoolgirl while sipping this beer.
M - smooth...the carbonation is not overbearing, and the alcohol is present and accounted for, but acts as a pleasant cohesive force to the beer.
D - believe it or not, i was feeling very relaxed after ONE of these badboys. i dont have a big tolerance, but wow! i wouldnt mind having 2 of these in one night, but i would be embarrassed at not saving it for another occasion! 
flawless beer. 754 charactersOutlawJoseyWales, Sep 30, 2006
4.52/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Pour is nearly black with thin head covering the surface. Nose flirts with scents of black cherry, syrupy brown sugar and caramel. Taste is much the same but with lots of dark fruitiness ... like sucking the skin from dark plums black cherries. If someone challenged me to come up with one word for the mouthfeel I'd use elegant. The body is thick and the carbonation strikes when it counts. I like this quad a lot. I'd probably reach for St Bernardus first but this wouldn't be far behind. Delectable. 502 charactersTheBungyo, Sep 30, 2006
4.47/5  rDev 0%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.533cl Bottle poured into oversized snifter. 11% ABV.
Deep brown almost black and isnt tranparent at all. Big two finger head which clung to the glass. It left a little film on top of the beer though. Hmm.
Sugar cane is first thing when you sniff. Great fruit notes, banana, orange, and apples are very present. When we work your way through you can smell the toasted malts.
A great taste on the tongue! Sweet fruit flavors at first give it an awesome smoothness. The malts dont overpower the drink at all. The carbonation really makes it smooth. The drink really gets powerful about half-way but you just dont care anymore because its so creamy. 
You just dont want the experience to stop, a great treat or present for any beer lover. A great beer. 769 charactersghostmech007, Sep 27, 2006

Smells mostly of dried fruit and chocolate...good chocolate.
Tastes amazingly good and complex. Thick , sweet malts, lots of chocolate...really good dark semi-sweet Belgian chocolate , carmel, dried fruits of various types...a hint of cherry,apple and anise in the background...maybe a slight sherry and slight coffee note. There's even more , but I can't come up with a description. Just incredibly complex. Let it WARM up for the full effect.
Mouthfeel was perfect...silky micro carbonation...velvety.
What a treat this was ! For whatever reason , the price has dropped a buck a bottle to $6.00...I will probably be drinking more of these....still very pricey, but worth the money for when you just have to have something unearthly. 800 charactersHautacam, Sep 23, 2006
4.35/5  rDev -2.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Appearance is dark brown with some red light passing through when held up. Smell is sweet and malty. Dark fruits come through a bit. Taste is of dark fruit, malts and a touch of sweetness. Sweetness gives way to a slight bitterness that makes taking another sip a must. Carbonation has an almost champagne feel. Small bubbles that are pleasantly active. The alcohol is very well hidden on this beer. Would have guessed it to be a 8% beer or so. Could definitely drink more than one of these if not careful. Definitely a thinking beer. This is not a smack you in the face beer (even with the alcohol). Drink this beer closer to room temperature because the flavors shine at that point. It was a little cold when I first opened and it was slightly muted. This is a quality beer and I will definitely enjoy these again soon. Would like age some and track the maturation. 867 charactersjtell, Sep 22, 2006

Pours a dark rich opaque chocolate brown. Fine bubbles foam up and recede to about 1/2 inch, leaving a fair amount of lacing.
One whiff and you know you are in for something special.Rich chocolate, caramel, intoxicating winey aromas of raisins, prunes, nutmeg.
Mouthfeel exquisite, creamy fine bubbles spread across the tongue creating a platform for a huge array of changing flavors to dance through your mouth. A beer to sip and contemplate. One of life's finest experiences. Sweet caramel and chocolatey flavors up front but there is enough tanginess as the fruit comes through, keeping things vibrant. On the finish spice lingers and a touch of alcoholic warmth sets your mouth vibrating and yearning for the next sip. As intense as this beer is, it's invigorating and highly drinkable, never exhausting. 
Truly a masterful expression of the brewer's art. One of the finest beers there is. 978 characterskenito799, Sep 19, 2006
4.77/5  rDev +6.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This beer was tasted in a tulip glass from the 33cl bottle.
This beer pours a rust brown with a frothy off white head. The smell is of plums raisins and red wine. Most of these flavors probably come from the use of candied sugar. The taste is also from the candied sugar. It gives a particular fruity flavor that reminds me of dark fruits such as plums and raisins. The mouthfeel is full bodied and naturally cabonated. Overall, highly dirnkable, a great Quad. 463 charactersMSchae1017, Sep 18, 2006
4.68/5  rDev +4.7%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Very dark brown that's very close to black. There's virtually no red coming through this one. Topped by a large two finger creamy head with thin webs delicately weaving down the glass. A thin layer of foam stays atop the brew while it's in the glass.
Dried plums/raisins in the nose with the smell of a pile of leaves in the front yard in Autumn. There's a sweet cough drop hint to it along with some alcohol. This one smells sweet for a quad.
Flavor exploding on the tongue in the form of sweet dried fruit (plums etc) come into the taste initially followed by a sweet almost medicinal flavor with some alcohol flavor and slightly dry in the finish. There's still some dried leafiness and rich Belgian yeast flavor although not as prominent as in other quadrupels I've had.
I'd have to say I enjoy this one more than St. Berny's. This is a fantastic sweet quad which has really made me smile. Many thanks to BA Mschae1017 for sharing this one with me. 961 characterstimtheenchanta, Sep 18, 2006
4.38/5  rDev -2%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Pours dark brown with creamy off white head which it retains really well for the ABV. Smell is alcohol, malty sweetness and carmel, maybe even a little coffee. Flavor reminds me of brown sugar, some roasted malts evident along with plenty of sweetness. The alcohol is present as well. This is medium full body, carbonation isn't prominant but the alcohol burn is. This is very drinkable for the ABV, but the price is prohibitive on this being a session beer. This is a good one, I'll definatly pick this one up again sometime. 526 charactersDizzy, Sep 14, 2006

A- Dark drown w/ small light brown head that goes away quickly; 
 yeast suspended throughout- if it werent for the unsightly yeast, 
 Id rate it higher 
S- Mmmmm Fruit just a tad overripe, tinge of alcohol, candy 
 sugar, and some tanginess
T- Red-wine like tartness, ripe fruit, brown sugar, as I drank this, I 
 noticed some peppery notes (perhaps from the suspended 
 yeast)
M- Very smooth, silky, and wonderful. Im kinda reminded that 
 theres alcohol in this beer from a slight warming effect, but 
 definitely does not feel like 11.3%
D- I finished this before I knew it- highly drinkable, taking into 
 consideration this is a 11.3% ABV ale
I have been waiting to try this, and it was worth the wait- I will have to try another soon and see if I get that suspended yeast
appearance- other than that, one of the most perfect beers Ive ever had. 989 charactersllitsua, Sep 13, 2006

Aromas show a highly expressive maltiness, fruit and floral qualities as well as a port wine boquet. The flavors? Where to begin? Such complexity! Rich with excellent fruitiness, floral/spicy flavors with a distinct bit of chocolate at the finish. It boasts a long, deeply satisfying finish. I finish this and almost weep because I have to move onto a different beer. Extraordinary! 433 charactersscluffman, Sep 10, 2006
4.3/5  rDev -3.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5This was almost all I expected from this beer. My only complaint is that the 11.3% alcohol made itself too evident in the aroma throughout, masking the hints of fruit I detected. Poured to a brownish color with thick tan head that lingered, then left very good lacing. Taste was very good dark fruit, and the finish was as smooth as almost any beer Ive had. This was my first quad to rate, but it definitely will not be my last. 430 characterskimcgolf, Sep 10, 2006
4.67/5  rDev +4.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Wow...it has been a long time since I have had a beer of this magnitude. Phenomenal pour uncovers a dark brown, almost maroon color thin head rises with some crackling carbonation and falls with some smallish bubbles ringing the glass. The bouqet is full and absoulutely amazing....full of rich carmels, candy apple, brown sugar, maplewood...and some faint dry alchoholic notes in the background....very full, very nice. The taste is great as well figs and dates, dark fruits, burnt carmel and again the mapel...the alchohol also shows its face in the finish with some warm notes all the way down...oooh to have a few of these on a cool night. The mouthfeel is creamy full and great but gives way to an ultra dry middle and then full again in the finish....more complex than any other beer I have been privy to at this juncture. 11.3% ABV says you aren't quaffing this one...but sit down an enjoy and you will definately want another, and another....and then you will want a nap. Try this one if you can! 1,004 charactershoffman, Sep 09, 2006
5/5  rDev +11.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Drank from an 11.2 fl. oz. bottle purchased at Colonial Spirits, Acton, MA
Poured a very dark, murky, ruby-brown with tons of large, floating yeast particles. The huge, saddle brown, pillowy head faded to a generous film with a thick ring of lace. Tons of bubbly, trickling lacing coated the glass.
Smell was intense, rich, spicy, sugary and malty with some alcohol evident. Scents of brown sugar, spices, ripe fruits, raisins, prunes come through quite strong.
Taste was extremely complex and smooth. Malty beyond belief. Ripe fruits, dried fruits, molasses, brown sugar as well as earthy and woody notes were quite evident. Some soft hops were consistently present throughout the drink, but they merely functioned to balance the sweetness. The aftertaste lasted for an eternity. Sweet malts and caramel flavors coated the palate. While the alcohol flavor was only moderately detectable, the beer warmed the mouth and throat.
Incredibly rich, supple and smooth mouthfeel. Medium bodied.
The drinkability of this beer was mind blowing when one considers that it is 11.3% ABV.
This beer sets the standard by which all Belgians should be judged. 1,149 charactersDamian, Sep 08, 2006
3.9/5  rDev -12.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Cloudy, dark brown with reddish hues and a tan head that clings to the glass. The aroma is candy-sweet, syrupy, with some spiciness like honey and cinnamon and toffee/caramel. The flavor is malty sweet, at first with a good strong dose of bitterness, almost medicinal but not quite. There are also hints of cherry, raisins, and a slight smokiness. This was quite well done although sometimes the flavors seemed to clash a bit. (I hate it when people say that but its really the best I can do...) 495 charactersKroMagnon, Sep 08, 2006
4.08/5  rDev -8.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4This beer pours a murky dark brown color with a light tan head. The thick head fades slowly, leaving many laces.
This beer has a very sweet caramel aroma. I also detect a strong spicy aroma. Maybe a little clove also. It has a citrus hop aroma as well. It has a strong earthy yeast aroma also.
This beer tastes very well balanced. It has a spicy flavor mixed in with some very sweet malts. A citrus, lemaony flavor is also present.
This beer is full bodied. It warms slightly as it goes down. It leaves a spicy, earthy aftertaste. This beer is perfectly carbonated for the style.
This beer would probably not make the best session beer. It is high in alcohol. Also, the flavor is quite aggressive.
Overall: This beer is good. I think there are better Quadrupel's out there. I would drink it again though. 819 charactersOStrungT, Sep 07, 2006

Appearance:
Pours a murky dark brown with a quarter inch of tan head on top that settles rapidly.	
Aroma:
Roasted malt, sweet caramel, ripe sticky dates notes of cocoa and some alcohol.	
Taste/Mouthfeel:
Smooth, but thin mouthfeel with muted fruit tones and subtle nuances of caramel followed by hot alcohol. I'm really surprised that this is such a highly rated beer. While this is good, it certainly isn't one of the best beers I've ever sampled. Nothing about it is exceptional, except perhaps the price. 574 characterscbl2, Sep 06, 2006
4.92/5  rDev +10.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5The one, the only.
Poured a very dark brown color with amber and ever so slight ruby hues. Head was enormous, frothy, rocky that went nowhere. Looked like a root beer float. Just perfectly gorgeous. Lacing galore after each and every sip left behind, decorating the glass. Smells of yeast, bananas, ripe dark fruits like figs and raisins, nutty, vanilla, and more. Huge complex aroma. Tastes of yeast, bready, ripe dark fruits, nutty, caramel, hints of chocolate, even cherries, a tad of spiciness like clove. Taste is everywhere. Deliciously complex. Every sip brings about a new hint of some other flavor, like anise for example, that I just picked up in my current sip. Ends with a noticeable alcohol warming, which from experience fades away to absolute smoothness with a bit of aging. Mouthfeel is slippery, creamy, pretty carbonated. I could have one of these everyday, but that would be it. Even though it is one of the best beers I have ever had in my life, it is still 11.3% ABV which takes away from the drinkability factor. Near-perfect brew. Cheers. 1,062 charactersDoomcifer, Sep 05, 2006

Expensive, but not the hhighest I've paid per ml of beer. It was a dark cloudy brown with a thick off-white head. Aroma was sweet (molasses) and dark fruit (raisins). Very tasty, smooth, raisins, a little spicy. Alcohol was non-detectable. A wonderful beer, very drinkable as a beer to savor, not to guzzle. 378 characterslordofthewiens, Sep 04, 2006
4.79/5  rDev +7.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5My last review as an acolyte...So chose my all-time favourite ale for the task.
Pours a thick, dense dark brown cloud.... some hints at the edge of burgundy. Thick tan head.
Nose of a candy store. Fruit lollies, sherbet, caramels.... 
Some washed-rind notes, and maybe a touch of clove...
This is literally a converation-stopper...the flavour is a complexity of malts & spices.... really hard to dissemble into its components. Perhaps some dried fruits.... dates, peel, raisins, nuts.... hint of chocolate, and the ubiquitous Belgian yeasty wildness. 
Quite a hot note, due to the alcohol, but not terribly cloying... a relatively dry finish... like an amontillado sherry.. 
And after a period, the hops come through as a late reminder, along with some lingering fruitcake. 779 charactersvancurly, Sep 03, 2006
4.38/5  rDev -2%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Very dark color with a creamy head that really hangs around nicely. The smell is on the sweet side. The flavor is very full with lots of dark dried fruit flavors with malt sweetness. The alcohol is a bit too noticeable for my taste. The mouthfeel is thick but not sticky. Just for the sake of comparison St. B's Abt 12 is better for my taste. The alcohol in this one is a little too prevelent. I will try this again if I have the chance but would probably save it for a cold winter night to enjoy the warming feel from the alcohol. 531 charactersheidelbeerg, Sep 02, 2006
4.17/5  rDev -6.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Pours dark brown with a lot of sediment floating around in there. The beer has about a one inch head that last for a bit and leaves a creamy white ring around my goblet.
Smell is very sweet with alcohol present. I am picking up raisons and apples with a slight touch of vanilla. A very pleasant smell.
Taste is very sweet with a strong raison and fig presence. A lot of alcohol present; not over powering but, probably a little more than I would prefer.
A very solid beer. I wouldnt put it ahead of the St. Berny's 12 but I would never turn one down and I will probably purchase this again. 599 charactershckyfn9999, Sep 01, 2006
3.73/5  rDev -16.6%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5Poured a light tan color head that sat a top a murky brown body. The head left decent lacing and had all the signatures of use of Belgian yeast, such as the Platue that forms with the head and the thick stick lacing. The smell and taste both had a sweet nutty malts aroma that was followed by a raisiny smell and taste. Both smell and taste had in it a fusal alcohol presence, which is to be expected for the ABV. It has a thick beer that was nicely sipped leaving a dry finish with a warming alcohol note. A beer that was well worth the $5.00 for a 12oz. 555 characterscproioi, Aug 28, 2006
4.33/5  rDev -3.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 330ml bottle into a goblet. Poured murky, dark brown with a small, fluffy tan head. The head was only about 1/2". Heavy sediment that completely filled the funnel shaped area in the bottom of my goblet as it settled.
Roasted malt, yeast, and spice aroma.
Sweetness and alcohol flavors dominate, but are nicely balanced. There are also nutty and malty flavors. It makes me think of baklava, but not as sweet. Of course, that may be because I had some baklava a few days ago, and it is fresh in my mind.
Smooth and medium bodied. Light carbonation.
Excellent flavor and body make this a very drinkable quadrupel, though I would be hard pressed to choose between this one and St. Bernardus (I haven't been lucky enough to try the Westveterlan 12). 770 charactersAmorousAngel, Aug 28, 2006
4.23/5  rDev -5.4%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Beer had a murky brown color that reminds me of iced tea. A nice off white colored head was about an inch before rapidly dissapearing. Lots of tiny carbonation bubble can be seen when held to light. Lacing runs away quickly.
A moderate amount of roasted malt aroma. Alcohol strength is also noticable over the secondary aromas. A light smoked almond scent. Minor hops finish to add a hint of bitterness to the smell.
Taste was a sweet blend of malt flavor and a light biscuit flavor. An alcohol presence is very noticable. A secondary taste of dark fruits, has the flavors of both plums and figs. No noticable hops taste to add any balance of bitterness to the fruity sweet blend.
A very nice feel in the mouth. Thick beer that goes down quite smooth while leaving taste on the tongue. A nice amount of carbonation helps taste hit all surfaces.
Overall a very nice beer. I normally don't like beer with the strength of this much alcohol in the flavor, but it is a fantastic example of the style. I would enjoy this as a compliment to pepper jack cheese with crackers as a perfect appetizer brew. A very enjoyable brew. 1,130 charactersRedChrome, Aug 27, 2006

4.92/5  rDev +10.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Pours out with lots of foam and lots of lacing in my tulip glass.
The color is brown to dark brown and light doesn't seem to penetrate it.
The smell is wonderful. Yeast and fruit and alcohol.
This is the better smelling beer of the Rocheforts. Deep down and way in the back is a coffee smell, but the yeast is here to stay.
The first sip was nutty and fruity. A bit of choclolate but the coffee bitterness is definitly there. This is a great tasting beer.
Mouthfeel is very clean but the alcohol is lingering in the back of the throat.
I could drink many of these if I could afford the price tag.

4.67/5  rDev +4.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5The beer poured a deep sepia brown with a foamy off-white head.
The aroma was of dark dried fruits, such as figs and raisins, Belgian yeast esters, dark caramelly sugars, and alcohol.
The flavor of the beer was immensly complex. It started out with a rush of figs, raisins, and a caramel sweetness. The warmth of the high alcohol helped the flavor flow into that of a nice port wine. The esters of the yeast gave the beer that distinct Belgian fruitiness. The aroma definitely had a synergystic effect with the flavor of this beer, more so than most other beers I've sampled. The high attenuation in this beer made it very smooth without any of the cloying sweetness that I believe detracts from St. Bernardus Abt 12.
The carbonation was fine and tight and appropriately high for this style. The mouthfeel was medium and satisfyingly creamy.
This is one of the most complex beers I've ever had. It never fails to disappoint me and my friends. This is one of those beers that has the ability to satisfy any beverage afficionado with its intricacy and can be enjoyed over a long session as it warms in the glass. Outstanding. 1,135 charactersSacoDeToro, Aug 23, 2006

Pours with plenty of natural carbonation producing one half inch of whispy, tan head simmering away after about one minute. Only a thin remainder of the head remains around the edges for the entirety of the drink. Deep brown and purple body with a slight cloudiness. Very deep red and orange tones are also visible. The pour requires some caution as to not disturb the copious amounts of sediment in the bottle. 
Powerful and fruity on the nose. Loaded with a vast amount of fruit presence. Raisins, figs, bananas and sweet apples. Delightfully sweet, malty presence polished with vanilla and oak qualities. Big yeast presence reinforcing the banana characteristics and adding a few spicy qualities. Notable alcohol presence but very subdued for this high ABV brew. Excellent. 
Huge rush of malty, sweet flavors. Loaded with prunes and dried figs. Slight toasted malt presence reinforces an oak and earthy flavor. Powerful yeast balances what could be an overbearing rush of flavors. Spicy notes suggesting nutmeg provides a tingly feeling on the tongue. Long-lasting finish with vanilla and oak from the yeast, sweet and candied sugar flavors from the malt and a kick of alcohol and spice. 
Mouthfeel is supremely carbonated for a beer that can be kept for so long. Despite the very long finish, this beer leaves the palate unscathed and awaiting another sip. 
Drinkability is good but nothing too special. Given the high ABV, it does go down easy. The spiciness and overall nature of this beer does take concentration to enjoy. If you're in the mood for a great beer this is certainly one. With that said, it demands respect and attention. 1,679 charactersBudlum, Aug 19, 2006
4.8/5  rDev +7.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 533cL bottle poured into a tulip-like glass. Served after about 1 1/2 hrs in the fridge. 
A: Pours dark dark brown with about 2" of white head. Still 1/4" of head well after 30 mins of pouring. This just looks like something special 
S: Mixture of dark fruits like black cherry and others, spices, and more. The aroma carries like crazy, you can smell it anytime the glass is in your hand practically. 
T: So much going on here. Starts off fruity, and then turns to chocolate milk. Then the spices come out (cloves?). An ever so slight taste of alcohol in the finish. 
M: Rich, thick, and creamy. Unbelievable smooth for 11+%. Delicious. 
D: Obviously a sipper, but I would sip one every night if I could.
Basically the only reason I'm not giving straight 5's is because I haven't tried Westy 12 yet. Amazing stuff that just gets better the closer to room temp. 878 charactersmjd83goblue, Aug 19, 2006
4.7/5  rDev +5.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Since I have yet to try the holy grail of Trappist Ales--Westvleteren, I would have to consider this one of the finest Trappist's that I have tried. I tried all three 6, 8, 10 and though I loved them all, I think 10 is the best of the three.
Appearance - Dark Brown
Smell - Dark Chocolate with a hint of spice
Taste - Chocolate with sweet fruity notes, which leads the to a hint warmth from the alcohol (though this barely scratches the surface of the complexity of tastes)
Mouthfeel - more carbonated than 6 or 8, but the carbonation tames yet compliments the sweetness of the ale.
Drinkability - Despite the higher alcohol content, the beer finishes rather nicely. 681 charactersHomerSimpson742, Aug 16, 2006
4.57/5  rDev +2.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Presentation: 33cL bottle, poured into a chalice
Appearance: very dark brown with a medium frothy, light tan head
Aroma: Very pleasant. Molasses, plum, fruity... and alcohol.
Taste: Wonderful flavor. Dark fruits, caramelized sugar, molasses... and alcohol. There is a definite alcohol presence that warms the back of the throat and prominent in the flavor. Silky smooth, heavy mouthfeel.
Notes: An outstanding beer. Great aroma and flavor, but the alcohol shows its presence a bit much compared to other quadrupels. But still, a wonderful beer that I will return to regularly. It paired excellently with a triple creme Brie. 636 charactersjdoolin, Aug 15, 2006
4.3/5  rDev -3.8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Appearance: Big 1 inch head with lots of stick lacing left for later. Darkest brown with mahogany hues. No real visibility. Medium viscosity. Impressive in the glass.
Aroma: Booze, cocoa, molasses, and a little breadiness. Balanced, rich, and pleasant - some cream and peanut developments.
Taste: Toffee, brown sugar, dried plums and a real booze tingle the whole way through. A little breadiness - the bready malt developments, with some raisins too. I can't help feeling that the booze in this is a little too much.
Mouthfeel: Booze is fairly heavy, though the body is a little lighter and the carbonation is subdued if constant.
Drinkability: I'd probably enjoy sitting on one of these every now and then as a good, warming sipper, but I can't help feeling that this doesn't have the subtle balance of other trappist beers. Impressive, though the booze is a challenge. 883 charactersexpatsteve, Aug 14, 2006
4.79/5  rDev +7.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Deep dark in color, with some mahogany hues around the edges. Average size, caramel colored head, that lasted as a slight film through the entire beer. 
The aroma is deep and fruity, brambles, raisins, plums, as well as some black liquorish and molasses. A bit yeasty, and noticeable phenols.
The taste started much the same as the aroma, dark fruits and dark sugar. It sweetened a lot as it warmed, with most of the flavor being ripe raspberries and strawberries. I thought this beer was comparable in flavor to a doppelbock, but with much more vibrant and readily available flavors (as you would expect from an ale v. a lager.) There was always a yeasty and phenol character to the beer throughout it, and some spicy-ness showed up as the beer went on, but the sweet fruitiness was the defining characteristic of this beer for me.
The mouthfeel was interesting. After I was about a quarter of the into this one, the top of my tongue started tingling for a while. I originally thought it was from a bit extra sparkling carbonation from the bottle conditioning, but as the spicy-ness showed up later in the beer, I thought that might have had something to do with it as well. The alcohol in this beer was awesome. About 20-30 seconds after a sip, a nice warming feeling would come from the belly. At no point was the alcohol off putting in this one, it was barely detectable besides the warming, which in turn makes this the definition of a dangerously drinkable beer at 11.3%. This beer exceeded my expectations which were high. 1,538 charactersdfried, Aug 14, 2006

s - as soon as i open this beer i am hit with the aroma. fruity with hints of chocolate and vanilla.
t - this beer's taste is very complex and hard for me to figure out. vanilla is the most distinct flavor to me. the alcohol is slightly evident but in a pleasant way.
m - smooth and really coats the tongue.
d - this is a very pleasant brew. i drank this during a hot alabama august and probably should have waited until the winter. i'll be sure to stock up on this for then. 694 charactersGPHarris, Aug 14, 2006

S - Strong chocolates, brown sugar, maple, very fruity.
T - Since the yast was kicked back up, I think that it is yeasty than it should be but I love it. its very much like a chocolate bready flavor. Some vinous characteristics. So complex that pinpointing just on flavor is damn near impossible. There is a lot of alcohol, but it is so perfectly hidden, that its not a factor. I am also reviewing this I think a little too cold. 
M - Sharp carbination bubbles hit the under rim of the front of my tounge, but then mellows out to a nice light creamyness. 
D - ....do I really need to say anything about this beer? It should be categorized as one of the best. 741 charactersquasimoto, Aug 12, 2006

Pour: murky, almost opaque, save for a few mahogany highlights under 3 fingers of off-white foam that fades leaving spotty lacing to a sparse skim.
Nose: kiwi-tart booze, caramel, cocoa powder, vanilla malt, more tart booze, passion fruit-pineapple and caramel apple sweetness as it warms.
Taste: Wow. warming(later burning) booze with notes of gooey carame-toffee, vanilla bean, banana bread, granny smith apples, raisins and gasoline.
Feel: a little harsh to be honest. Not Old Ruffian territory, but every sip shoots alcoholic vapors up the nostrils. Body is yeasty rich, but thinned by the alcohol.
Drinkability/Overall: frankly, the 8 gets better marks for depth of flavor and drinkability. The great complexity I know this beer has is overshadowed by the booze. A few years would do this beer well. Just might have to pick up another bottle for cellaring. 944 charactersGolden2wenty1, Aug 10, 2006
4.83/5  rDev +8.1%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5It is hard to register this as what I used to call "beer" before my enlightenment. It has flavors far beyond my palate, a smoothness/richness that is so far unmatched to me. Drinkability at its abv is phenomenal, but you know what you're getting. Dark fruits, sweet malts, with a slightly bittersweet and long lasting finish that goes on and on. As it warms from my fridge the complexity deepens. This, so far, is my island beer. 429 charactersmfcohiba, Aug 10, 2006
4.59/5  rDev +2.7%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5It pours a murky milk chocolate brown with two fingers of creamy beige head that slowly melt away. Falls of lacing cascade down the inside of the glass. 
The aroma is a hefty haul of grain, malted and with cocoa, plum, dates, and toffee. A mellow spiciness combines with a doughy yeast note. An earthy tanginess just disguises a tendon of alcohol. 
Upon sipping, there slinks forth the sweet duskiness of toasted grain, plush with coffee, sloe fruit, cocoa again, caramel, and the merest hint of cola. A complimentary caress of corander and clove rounds the grain and lends to an understated bitterness. Alcohol spikes potently in the middle, but it quicky dissipates to reveal a lingering finish of muted residual grain, tangy yeast, and gentle bitterness. It's complex, blended, classy, classic, and wonderful. 
Medium bodied, it lays like silk on the palate, coating and tingling enticingly. 
It's intriguingly complex, splendidly blended, and is obviously a stylistic statesman. It's a joy to behold on every level, and it gives up its bounty willingly, but mostly to an able palate. The ABV is right out front, but it's a warming product of its nature. It keeps your attention, and rewards your attention lavishly. That is a great way for a beer to be. 1,269 charactersFoxman, Aug 08, 2006
4.84/5  rDev +8.3%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Pours from the 330ml bottle into my Duvel tulip glass. Body is a deep dark brown with ruby red highlights, topped by a half inch of creamy light brown head that leaves some pretty lacing on the glass. Beautiful aroma is almost too complex to describe - notes of apricot, raisin, chestnut, sweet dark malt, lactose, and more than a little alcohol. Palate is simply wonderful - a huge smile came across my face with the first sip. Rich, sweet malt, dark fruit, a touch of spiciness, all mixing in perfect harmony. Beautifully creamy mouthfeel is just absolutely perfect - velvety smooth, without the thick, syrupy body that can overwhelm some of the stronger beers, along with a lightly dry finish. If not for the strength and the price, I might never drink anything else again. 776 charactersElGordo, Aug 08, 2006
4.7/5  rDev +5.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Deep dark in colour, slightly hazy due to my inability to retain all of the yeast at the bottom of the bottle upon pouring. Thick lacey had that waffs the aroma up nicely.
Nose has a resemblance to anejo tequila, raisins, and baked desserts.
On the palate dark coca, roasted malt, tawny port (not to be confused with ruby!) and reduced calorie maple syrup. Body is a little on the thin side but it enhances the drinkability.
Finish is peaceful and gradual in flavor dissipation. I notice a caramelly and light cinnamony peppery sweetness that fades into a pleasant malt extract-like cloying sweetness. Nice. 610 charactersyemenmocha, Aug 05, 2006
4.77/5  rDev +6.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5My first review for BA, and seeing as this is my favorite beer to date, while also seeking a special occassion to drink the remaining one in my cellar, I decided to review it on this stormy afternoon.
11.2 oz bottle poured into a tulip glass. Pours a beautiful dark brown with a rich head that disappears quickly. Leaves a foamey lace in its wake.
Smells like heaven. Fruits- sugary figs and cherries with only a slight hint of the 11.3% alcohol it contains.
Taste is unparalleled. The alcohol is hidden amongst a variety of dark fruit and peppery tastes. The fruit hits you up front, but leaves a pleasant, almost chocolately aftertaste. A true pleasure to drink. 
The mouthfeel is also superb. You would not expect such high carbonation from such a rich beer. Leaves a pleasant sensation, like having taken a sip of champagne
This Belgian gem may perhaps be the world's finest. My only regret is that I do not have another in my cellar to enjoy. 962 characterscoltrane4me, Aug 03, 2006

Aroma: Brandy aroma dominates! Alcohol prominent along with notes of figs, raisins, & dates. Other dried fruits such as cherries also evident. Brandy butter & Christmas pudding....
Taste: Very tasty! Earthy fruits such as raisins, dates & plums. Alcohol prominent but not overpowering. Fruity, malty yet balanced out with the high ABV.
Mouthfeel: Light bodied with medium to high carbonation. The carbonation leaves the mouth feeling crisp & clean. Not cloying at all.
Drinkability: Very slow sipper. Although smooth & clean, this has a high ABV & can deceive. The carbonation dulls the ABV% which makes it easier to drink.
Comments: I enjoyed this Belgian Abbey tremendously. Delicious! Even though it has a strong brandy flavor, and I don't enjoy hard liquor, I truly enjoyed this beer. Excellently crafted! Truly world class as I was expecting... 1,028 charactersJMD71, Aug 03, 2006

The huge frothy head slowly dissipates while leaving, not just lace, but chunks of foam on the sides of the glass. This is an elegant looking beer.
Smells exceptional. Dark fruits (mainly raisins) with some alcohol. The sweet aroma of the first few whiffs is extremely rich. A nice prelude of what's to come; my anticipation was growing.
Similar to the smell, it tastes of sweet dark fruit. There's also a nice chocolate touch. Some alcohol, but you wouldn't think it's 11.3%. Intense and complex, yet it manages to be incredibly smooth.
Effortless drinkability. The alcohol is very well hidden, and the taste kept me completely engaged.
Drinking Rochefort 10 was a memorable beer experience. It's elegant, refined, and demands respect. I love this line from their website: "To conclude still this: make no abuse of this gift of God." 949 characterswolffman17, Jul 30, 2006

11.2 oz bottle poured into an over-size wine goblet.
Dark reddish/ brown color, 2" thick mocha head dissipated to a thin but constant frothy layer with a circular "eye" of deeper brownish color directly in the middle of the glass.
Smells of Honey-like-malt sweetness, apricots, barley, some floral hints and cherry.
Taste: Wow, first hit is heavenly. Gives a nice honey sweetness and earthy-green and floral hop bite and a fruitieness, including: apricot and cherries. that is all seemingly well balanced with one another. Alcohol is slightly hot but warming in the taste. Starts sweet,malty and fruity, ending tart and bitter with complex yeast flavor profile. 
Feels freakin' smooth yet very heady. Active and lively. Seems to simply evaporate on the tongue,a dancing light body, light feel...NOT light in flavor or any other aspect.
11.3 % ABV. Keeps this limited to only a few in one sitting but doesn't stop you from craving another...deceptive in it's ways. 1,010 charactersGratefulBeerGuy, Jul 27, 2006

The aroma is an intriguing mix of bubble gum, sweet fruit and a suggestion of alcohol. 
The body is slightly syrupy but very drinkable, considering the high alcohol content. 
The complexity of flavors is overwhelming. Sweet malt, sugar, fruit, raisin, caramel all balanced by a slight bitter presence of hops. 
This is a beguiling brew and an absolute pleasure to drink. 502 charactersEstarrio, Jul 27, 2006

Poured dark brown - almost black - with a creamy off-white head with what looked like a small cinnamon swirl.
The smell was of caramel, spices, and alcohol. A bit thin - but present.
The taste was near-heavenly. The sugar candy, caramel and alcohol intermingled to make a divine taste.
It was sweet, a touch too much so, and full-bodied. The alcohol added to the taste, but almost over-powered it.
It was smooth and tasty - quite sweet. The alcohol and sugar lingered. A real "sipping" treat. 526 charactersjwc215, Jul 27, 2006

Pours a deep amber hued light brown with garnet edges close to light. A thin white half-finger head slowly gave way to a white ring of sticky lace. Aroma is sweet and earthen, dark fruits, malt, alcohol and warm bread. Taste is complex, sweet and malty, alcohol brings some warming with it's presence, fruitier than the nose inclines. Mouthfeel is rough due to the moderate levels of alcohol and carbonation, medium weighted body finishes off the palate with a crisp dryness. Drinkability is exceptional given the high abv, although far from bashful in it's appearance. Overall, a well balanced and well executed beer. 677 charactersdanielocean03, Jul 25, 2006
3.62/5  rDev -19%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 2.5Dark and heavy, but with strong notes of fruit on the nose (and in the mouth) , especially bananas. The alcohol is a stronger force than in the 8, and you'll taste it in your mouth and feel it in your head-- at eleven percent alcohol and change, it's nigh on impossible not to. Rochefort 10 seems to open up like a wine or a lambic after a few minutes in the air, and those sweet, sweet beer fumes explode out of the goblet.
If I don't burn in the darkest recesses of Hell for my wicked life, I might still wind up in beer hell for this-- I liked Rochefort 8 better. 10 was too parching and alcoholic for me; those 11.3 points of engine cleaner seemed to overpower some of the subtlety that makes this monk-brew so damned transcendent in the first place.
But I nitpick. Rochefort 10 is easily worth vows of poverty and chastity.
Well, maybe not chastity.
RERATE: I think I hated this more than the review indicates the first time I had it. Also, the numbers are way too high. That said, I liked it a lot better this time. It's still too sweet, too unbalanced, and too hot, but there's some nice stuff going on here-- it's by far the most estery, phenolic example of a super-estery, super-phenolic style, and I really can't get enough bananas in my beer. I enjoyed it, didn't find it totally undrinkable, but this really is NOT as well-crafted as Rochefort 8. I said it and I'm sticking with it.
But I'm glad it's back on shelves in Chicago, mostly because I like seeing it. 1,486 characterskajerm, Jul 24, 2006

Leaves almost no lacing. The 11.3% abv comes through strong in the smell along with the aroma of sweet fruit and some bready malts. In the first sips I was surprised that the alcohol in the nose is not near as evident in the taste. The taste is more of fruit, molasses, and malt. As it warms though, the alcohol starts to become more prevalent. Full body that is smooth and creamy with little carbonation. 
Overal an excellent and well balanced beer. I put this one up against the St. Bernardus Abt 12 tonight and in my opinion this one is just as good if not a ittle better. 700 charactersFuller, Jul 23, 2006

S: What a trip. As I smelled this, I kept having flashes of memories but I could not put my finger on what the smell was. 15 minutes went by until the surprising truth came to my mind....PATRON. This stuff really smells like Patron with brown sugar, oak, black currants and sunflower seeds. Holy crap, one of the most amazing smelling beers I've ever embarked on.
T: Begins nutty with some tequila high notes on the tip of the tongue. Mellow notes of soft, ripe fruit tickle the palate and share their sweetness with the other flavors. Then the malt happens. Toffee, dark fruits, bitter chocolate and vanilla bean take control and raise the flavors in intensity till finally a crescendo then gently fading away. The alcohol is present intensely through the entire process. 
M: Medium to full bodied with good carbonation. After a few spins in the glass I released some of the excess gas and brought the mouthfeel down to a perfect level.
D: Couple more years on this beer would have done some amazing things. This is a whiskey drinkers beer....full of intense flavors and alcoholic vapors. Phenomenal. 1,308 charactersWestsidethreat, Jul 20, 2006
4.07/5  rDev -8.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4This beer was poured in celebration of my birthday. It has a deep red colour that almost seems like purple or garnet. A tan head with many crags and crevaces formed off the pour and quickly disappeared in what was quite a fizzy display. There are a few shelves of lace left in the aftremath.
The nose is heavy with dark fruit impressions. Grapes, plums, and even some black cherry come to mind as I whiff this. I also detect some alcoholic vapours and a bit of bitterish rind or fruit skin impression. It smells sort of wild and nearly like wine. Some yeasty character shows through true to form for the Belgian sector.
The taste is surprisingly underwhelming. The nose seems much more rich and potent when compared to the flavour. I was expecting the taste to follow the nose in boldness. Instead, it is a lighter assortment of the aforementioned dark fruits and a good helping of chalky yeast quality. The finish becomes a bit dry and helps to squelch the sweet fruitiness that came early on. The alcohol is noticeable, but it is a welcome layer to the flavour package. The malt base is just not as hearty as I had hoped. 
The mouthfeel is a bit light just as the flavour is. I find this to be a thin and weakly flavoured brew which is definitely not what I had expected.
The drinkability is good. There is really no element here that overpowers or causes the drinkability to be low. Overall, this brew is a touch disappointing. I may have brought this on myself. Just because this beer is what it is, I had high hopes for it to astound me. It fell short, but it is indeed a great beer with much character. 1,620 charactersSupaCelt, Jul 19, 2006
4.57/5  rDev +2.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Appearance  I was surprised to see that when I poured this the head didnt grow insanely. There was about a half of a centimeter of nice creamy tan foam which stayed for a while and left some lacing. The color is a nice dark brown with maroon aspects that is opaque. 
Smell  Wow. Absolutely amazing. There is a ton of fruitiness to this one. Raisins, plums, melon, banana, and some grapes all arise. There is a nice rummy scent as well bringing about alcohol. On top of this I smell just a touch of ginger and lots of nice dark sweet malt that accentuate sweetness. 
Taste  This one is a little sweeter than it smells and this isnt in any way a bad thing. Sweet malts dominate off the bat and alcohol is more present as well. While attempting to decipher what else there was in this beer I definitely got a taste of yeast too. The finish was all of dark fruit just as it smelled. 
Mouthfeel  Great. Creamy and the carbonation doesnt bite. A little bit of stickiness is left in the mouth but its insignificant. 
Drinkability  Pretty good. I didnt have any troubles here. Burns a bit from alcohol but there is too many good things for that to affect it overall. 
Simply another amazing Trappist Beer. Didnt expect anything less here. 1,267 charactersOrrshow, Jul 18, 2006

Highs: Nose, taste, mouthfeel
Lows: Anemic head
After trying numbers 6 and 8, I went into this tasting with some trepidation. Previous Trappistes offerings had proven too elusive for my palate. 
Pours a very dark reddish-brown, virtually opaque. One finger head of tan that quickly fades, leaving fair lacing behind. Noseah, what a bouquet. Very sweet with bananas strongly present. Sweet malt and probably even syrup. Taste again, wonderful. Initially very sweet banana, yet the sweetness is quickly balanced, stopping short of being just sugary-syrupy. A bit of alcohol, dark fruit/plums, and a nice clean finish with maybe some light hops. Its a lot to wrap ones tongue around; Ill definitely have to try it again and again. Mouth is just about perfect, lightly syrupy/semi-creamy, smooth, and perfect little bubbles that gently caress the tongue. Drinkability is excellent.
Overall: Damn, I think this may well be the best beer Ive yet tried. Extremely well integrated, about the only thing I can ding it on is the lackluster head. It will take a few more sessions to fully appreciate the flavor complexities. An excellent brew, go out and get one TODAY! 1,222 charactersjettjon, Jul 12, 2006
4.3/5  rDev -3.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Pours a dark brown color with a huge frothy head that left layers of sticky lace on the glass. Aroma was very malty and caramelly with notes of banana, dark fruit and some herbal hop notes in the nose. Taste was quite rich and malty. Lots of flavors of malt, dark fruit, figs and chocolate balanced with a nice hop bitterness. This is a pretty full bodied beer, almost a meal in a glass. Amazing that the alcohol is so well hidden at 11.3%. This makes for high drinkability and can sneak up on you if you're not careful. Recommended, but not for the faint of heart. 565 charactersrodrot, Jul 07, 2006
4.65/5  rDev +4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Presentation: 330mL brown bottle. Looks like this bottle is good till April 5th 2011, an "Authentic Trappist Product"
Appearance: Pours a beautiful rich, deep mahogany with a brownish hued head that leaves a wonderful lace as it dissipates. Yeasty sediment you don't notice until your final sips...
Smell: Earthy, sweet rummy prunes and banana cotton candy.
Taste: Lightly carbonated mouthfeel. Sweet, alcoholic upfront that lasts well after it is in your belly. As you drink, the alcohol is less noticeable and leads to wonderful complexity of dark malts, fruits and spices. Very smooth and drinkable for such a potent beverage.
Overall: A wonderful beer, one of the best I have ever had. An excellent warmer to sip and savor. You WILL want to have another, when the time is right.... 797 charactersjarsh, Jul 07, 2006
4.05/5  rDev -9.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5Dark brown, hazy in color. Moderate head, which faded fairly quickly. Smell was sweet and malty, with raisins and other fruits coming through. Taste was very complex, and takes a while to sort out (like all night...) -- raisins, port wine, chocolate, bubblegum, pepper at finish. Wow, what a beer. The mouthfeel was thick, with very little carbonation. The alcohol provided a nice warmth after a few sips. I think I would have enjoyed this more on a winter evening rather than the summer, but that was my issue, not the beers. 526 characters, Jul 05, 2006
4.34/5  rDev -2.9%look: 5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Appearance- Leaves a thick, robust two-finger head. I made sure to pour the yeast in my glass. Cause the sediment, in my mind is part of the beer, regardless of what others say. PLus it's hard to waste a beer like this. It ads to the head since the sediment left flaoting with the foam looks like that cinnamon they put on a frothy mocha a Starbucks. Color is a mix of realy roasted orange peel and radddish skin. Go figure. Beautiful bubbling and lacing too boot.
Smell- CVloves and bubblegum. Plus the sugary equivalent of Euro toostsie rolls. Like really fake chocolate sugars. 
Taste- Starts with some Belgian malts. Lightly roasted and mostlt toasted. These malts help give the feeling of bubblegum on the first sip with a mix of black licirice and blck Himalayan tea. Not a lot of bittering hops descernable from the taste. 
Mouthfeel- Great crabonation and a clean yet undeniably warming finish that lasts for a great amount of time. Lots of complex flavors make a pretyy damn good melange of flavors all over my tongue. The monks know what the hell they are doing. 1,081 charactersscruffwhor, Jul 05, 2006

3.95/5  rDev -11.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4I enjoyed this with some other Trappists at a Trappist tasting. It's "lesser" the Rochefort 8 I had and had a greater taste of alcohol but actually less. One thing I've tried in the past is "rolling" or mixing the yeast up before I pour. I know many prefer not, but I want the whole experience and I try to distinguish a difference with and without the sediment. Onto the 10.
A: Pours a dark brown, with little foam quickly dissipating. 
S: The Nose has the mix of yeast and malt, with the hint of caramel and bananas.
T: I love this trappist for its strong presence, tasting the ETOH but not too strong to take away from the rich flavor of the yeast and malt mixture and the carbonation, with a touch of pears and ETOH in the finish.
M: The ETOH is subtle so it is still smooth.
D: Everyone must have a good trappist once in a while, but don't abuse the purity of these "miracles" in a bottle.

Taste started out seeming pretty complex, mostly dark fruit like figs, a hint of brown sugar, but the more I continued drinking it, the less I liked it. The sweetness started to seem cloying, and there was a bubblegum taste that started to overpower the beer as it warmed up. Personally, I liked the Rochefort 8 better, and for the $$$, I probably won't be buying this one again. 477 charactersLarryV, Jul 01, 2006

S- Roasted malts, very nutty, and a slight sweetness of sugar or possibly caramel.
T- Malty nutty body, light toffee notes. Right before the finish there is a hint of hops, but they are not too pronounced. The finish is strong with alcohol, and this is reasonable being that the beer is 11%abv..there is also a kind of sweetness. 
M/D- This beer reminded me of wine in the mouthfeel, except that it had lots of bubbles....it really coated the toungue....Drinkability....the alcohol could have been hidden a little better....This was pretty good, but I was surprised to see it is in the top ten. 796 charactersjameaterblues, Jun 22, 2006

11.2 oz bottle strange dating stamp that doesn't mean anything to me. 
Poured slowly into a snifter, dark amber to brown color with a dense tan head. Great lacings and incredible head retention.
Rich sweet aroma rises with strong fruit tones and noticable estery alchohol. Has a port like strength to the aroma with floral and spicy tones, - incredible.
The taste is potent and rich. Strong estery dark fruit, plum, grape, a slight nuttyness, vanilla and clove. 
Mouthfeel is full bodied with strong carbonation to hide the slickness. Tartness toward the end with a slightly bitter and dry earthy finish.
Wow, this is beer? Amazing what those monks can do... Awesome depth and complexity of flavors, probably more that my pallate can do justice to. Definately not an everyday drinker but I plan to keep a few on hand for special occasions. 931 characterskgotcher, Jun 22, 2006

It has a very nice smell to it too, can't really pick up much alcohol which is kinda scary! 
At least they couldn't hide it in the taste which knocks down the drinkability a bit. I like this but boy does the alcohol show up...
Mouthfeel is also impacted (to me) by the alcohol, this one isn't particularly subtle, Boy does it taste good though! 550 characterssurfadelic23, Jun 19, 2006

Smell of bananas hits foremost with chocolate, caramel, plum and currant coming through.
Taste was great. Hard to separate flavors; chocolate, raisin, biscuit, malt, some hops and spice.
Alcohol is present but nicely balanced. A kick at first, but you get used to it. 457 charactersMebuzzard, Jun 19, 2006

Smell was sweet and fruity with nearly no alcohol, which I thought was impressive, given the alcohol content. Taste was malty sweet with some fruity notes. Alcohol makes a nice subtle appearance in the taste - very warming and slightly medicinal. Some spiciness contributed by the yeast. Hasn't been the fullest bodied beer I have ever tasted, but not weak in this category either. Stands up well to the alcohol. Very drinkable for the alcohol content but is definitely a beer to sip and enjoy. 579 charactersjhu1995, Jun 17, 2006

Taste: Very spicy flavor can taste the alcohol but it fades quickly very unique.

4.03/5  rDev -9.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Trappistes Rochefort 10 pours a chocolate brown color with an off white head and chunks of yeast from a less than perfect pour from a 33cl bottle. The aroma is somewhat fruity and alcohol is noticeable. The alcohol is noticeable in the taste too, not in a bad way though. Some dark fruit flavors are present. Chocolate comes to mind too, but its not really chocolate or chocolatey tasting, just an aspect of the flavor. I'm not sure I appreciate the style as much as others do. Definitely an interesting beer and quite good to boot. I think I may have to revisit this again sometime. 583 charactersDrew966, Jun 13, 2006
4.25/5  rDev -4.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Poured from the brown 11.2 oz. bottle with the best by date of 08.07. Forms very little dark white head which dissipates quickly. This is a Belgian Trappist Quadruple, and as such, numbs the tongue with alcohol. Slight smell of bread, malt, clove, cinnamon and yeast. The taste includes all of the smells with the addition of piney resin and hop. The mouthfeel is very thick, but just what one would expect of the style. The drinkability is quite good considering this is not the sort of beer you will be drinking all day. Summation: The monks at Abbaye St. Remy are doing what other brewers the world over should be trying to do, hitting the mark, without overdoing it.

Nose is spicy, tangy, boozy. A little sharp, not unpleasant.
Flavor is sweet, spiced caramel malt with a distinct alcohol presence on the finish. Plenty of interesting flavors, but overall not as complex as the 8.
Mouthfeel is medium, with plenty of carbonation.
Drinkability is OK. I prefer the 8. 398 charactersghostwalker, Jun 08, 2006
4.57/5  rDev +2.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Poured from 33cl bottle(best by 08/09) a cloudy dark brown with a large head of foam that dissipated slowly leaving just a fine layer with lots of lacing.
The smell is all sweet and fruity and yeasty with strong notes of plum. A very nice nose indeed.
The taste is very sweet up front; I note molasses & fig(?) with just a touch of the plum that I noted in the smell and no yeasty flavour at all. The alcohol is not a factor in the taste but does create a bit of a warming feeling...nothing wrong with that but I know that 1 of these is all that I could handle at 1 sitting. ;^)
Bottom line: I had this brew a couple of years ago and I have to honestly say, I didn't care much for it at the time but now, after expanding my palate's horizons, so to speak, I find this brew a definite winner and certainly a world class product. I thoroughly recommend it! 863 charactersBitterbill, Jun 04, 2006

4.08/5  rDev -8.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Poured out a ruby-hued dark brown with a somewhat thin head that looks like steamed milk. With each sip, I get lacing down the glass that remind me of Rorschach ink blots. I smell some fruity esters as well as some yeasty characteristics in the forefront; with alcohol and malt further back. With the taste, the phenolics drop off a bit, but they are still well represented. I taste mostly the fruity esters, along with the dark malt, and some candy sugar. To put the flavors in a more readable way, this tastes like sweet bread, apple juice, banana milkshake, and Welch's grape soda. Flavors are incredibly soft. Mouthfeel is fantastic. Like liquid velvet. Just enough carbonation to keep it from being a syrupy mess. Perfect. This is way too drinkable, but it doesn't get a perfect mark, because my head is starting to spin. I can't believe this is 11.3%. 
A really soft, and complex, version of a quadrupel. I like it. 924 charactersgoochpunch, Jun 03, 2006

Pours 15% head in a Kasteel chalice.
Nose is powerfully sweet coriander-like syrupy dark notes. 
Taste if anything is underwhelming. The aforementioned notes appear in the taste, with a malty background which becomes dominant in the aftertaste. In a way it is disappointing, the taste seems understated compared to the promising aroma.nose...Going to let this warm a bit more....it is disappointing to score this so low because I have had much better examples of it even this year, but spicy syrupy beer this was, missing something.
all said, a really unique beer, i like westveleteren products more, but it is a special drink and the complexity has improved greatly over time. 765 charactersdogfooddog, May 31, 2006
4.74/5  rDev +6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Poured into a Rochefort goblet. Very dark brown, with a trace of red, almost black. Beautiful hazy light head, which leaves a beautiful understated lacing around the glass.
You can tell just from the smell that this thing's gonna be good. Very complex. Rich molasses, caramel, and fruity hops, plus a half dozen other flavors I can't quite place.
First sip - incredible. This is an incredibly complex beer. The malty flavor is the strongest; brown sugar, molasses, caramel. Nice fruity flavor to balance the taste out, particularly raisin. The alcohol is not overpowering at all, considering this thing is closer in ABV to wine than beer. This thing is incredible, and it's hard to imagine anything that tastes better than this.
Thick, creamy, full-body, yet not too heavy. This is heaven for your palate.
The ABV is the only thing keeping me from giving this a 5 as far as drinkability. This stuff is just so smooth; it drinks like something with half the amount of alcohol. 979 charactersPhocion, May 30, 2006
4.87/5  rDev +8.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5A 3-4 year old bottle...
Appears a hazy dark caramel brown with a small light tan head that fades into a mild, dissipating cap and collar. Little bits of yeast are in the bottom of the glass with tiny bubbles slowly rising to the top of the beer.
Smell is of dusty caramel, brown sugar, raisins, molasses, cocoa, bananas, with dark fruits, and berries.
Taste is of the same aromas in a fine, fine mix that is like an outstanding milk shake with well blended sweetness and rum.
Mouthfeel is rum filled with a banana & cocoa shake mixed with a dash of caramel, raisins, and brown sugar that is evenly balanced with a touch of alcohol....reminds me of a drink I got on my honeymoon that was a banana mashed in a blender with rum and cocoa syrup. These beautiful flavors coat the tongue and palate with a pleasing dessert like enjoyablilty that makes you forget that there is over 11% abv.
A sipper for the most part but it doesn't get much better than that. This is a world class beer. 982 charactersweeare138, May 27, 2006
5/5  rDev +11.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Pours into the glass with a thick, rocky head. Extremely small bubbles & gorgeous lacing. Almost black in color with a tan head that settles into bands of varying thickness & color. Smell is rasins, licorice, and dark chocolate. The taste is as divine as the origin of this Trappist. Truly exceptional. Sharp at first, makes the tongue tingle. The spices fade and the sweet, almost plum-like flavor takes over. Then that fades and a crisper aftertaste with noticable alcohol. Finally, if you wait, a resurgance of the spice with a hint of nutmeg?
Out and out one of the VERY best beers I've ever tasted. I hesitate to rate anything all 5's but I just can't come up with anything to argue about. 697 charactersroblowther, May 20, 2006

The head is thick, foamy and holds for an extremely long time. The lacing is great and leaves beautiful rings on the glass. It smells like dark sugars and lightly phenoly smell. Almost a hint of chocolate. Perhaps just a faint hint of cookie dough. 
The taste is.oh my god! Great!It is very warming and peppery. There is a nice fruitiness to it which is similar to raisins and plum. The yeast is very light and the malt is fantastic. The carbonation is high, but it just doesnt seem to matter. This is incredibly smooth on the palate. 
This is a fantastic beer, no way of getting around it. It has many superior qualities which are executed in an excellent manner. Check this beer out. It is most certainly worth the money. 806 charactersMitchel, May 20, 2006

Spicey nose with a big thick malt aroma, fig, mollasses, brown sugar, caramel, brown sugar, some earth and other dark fruits.
Complexity is the first thing that comes to mind with this beer. Agressive thick chewy malts, with enough hop character to balance. Big fig, brown sugar, maple, other baking spices, cinnamon, good amount of alcohol burn in the chest.
Nice smooth thick creamy mouthfeel. With a good 30 second finish. A very good beer. Drinkability suffers a little because of the burn in the chest in throat. 684 charactersmcallister, May 19, 2006

Big warming alcohol character mixed with tart sweetness, raisons, light brown sugar, and some licorice. Very smooth, very rich and creamy, flavors compliment one another very well. Flavors are niceley in balance of each other. Alcohol is very perceivable but not exactly abbrassive.

4.63/5  rDev +3.6%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 433cl brown bottle with standard Rochefort lable. This is the last beer in my Rochefort 3 pack. Dark brown in color with a big, off white head that lasts. Smell is big and bold. Cocoa and raisins as well as something sour that hits the back of my nose. As you hold it up to the light, you notice the effervesance. 
Taste is similar to the smell only bigger and bolder. Chocolate and dates in the beginning give way to something dusty and earthy. Aftertaste is a lot of alcohol, much more than I expected. Chalky and dry in parts as well. Takes a few sips to get used to it but it does mellow out. This is a sipper and should be treated with respect. 651 charactersCharlesRiver, May 18, 2006
4.4/5  rDev -1.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Last night I opened a brand new bottle of Rochefort 10 along with one that was about 3 years old (based on the best-by date and older label style). I've always been a big fan of this beer, and the style, and I wasn't disappointed by either of the samples. They were both complex and sweet, with a slightly fruity alcohol taste, excellent body and mouthfeel. Aroma and flavor abound with hints of prune, date, and wonderful Belgian yeast esters. As much as I enjoyed the new bottle, aging for 3 years brought the beer close to perfection. The 10's alcohol bite isn't bad for a strong beer, but the older bottle was far smoother, balancing things out better and allowing the more complex flavors to be tasted. Either way, I'd drink this beer anytime, and perhaps every time, given the chance. 790 charactersBeauregard, May 17, 2006
3.97/5  rDev -11.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5I bought this beer after raving reviews and now there is chalice in front of me with a nice dark red/brown beer and a small head. 
The smell was wonderfull, very mild with mocha and chocolate, slight burned malts, and very little alcohol.
Taste was completely different, lots of alcohol, maltbitter, raisins and very unsubtle with a thin body and a boozy feeling in my throat. This burns a hole in my body! Aftertaste is dry and maltbitter, and I feel that this is the Rochefort 8 with an extra amount of sugar added. I am having an internal conflict about this beer, on the one hand it is very unsubtle and everything revolves around the strong alcoholic character of this beer, which leaves every other taste to be in second place.
On the other hand, it is a nicely created beer, in which you can taste the authenticity of the beer and the love for the end product.
I think I will lean more towards the first impression, but it is still a great beer. 956 charactersAbsumaster, May 13, 2006

A: Pours with tremendous head that over flows into a beautiful cone shape. leaves wonderful lacing down the sides. Cloudy molasses color with sediment on the bottom.
S: Brown sugar, dark bread very yeastie. Can distinguish a bacteria like ester from the yeast. Smells like molasses. Not superb but very good aromatics.
T: This is one hell of a beer. A spicy maltiness that is unsurpasses by any other belgian I have ever had. Hints of chocolate are hidden behind a strong liquorice base. Brown sugar and molasses are evident. Awesome.
M: This is the best body I have ever had. It is silky smooth and creamy but not overkill. It is full bodied and not heavy, but close. The carbonation perfectly matches the body. I cannot say enough good about the mouthfeel.
D: I am constantly returning the glass to my lips. A slow drinking beer, but no hint of the 11% abv. 888 charactersKyleVick4, May 12, 2006
4.75/5  rDev +6.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5A - Pours a very dark brown, almost black with a tight tan head which sits a finger thick through most of the drink. 
S - Sweet, syrupy, fruits, mild phenols, alcohol, bit of chocolate.
T - Big, sweet and slightly spicy malt up front. Some fruit and phenols in the background. Liquorice and alcohol warmth come through and remain in the after taste. Alcohol is well masked given the strength of this beer. There's a lot going on here.
M - Silky smooth and full-bodied with low carbonation. Sublime.
D - Certainly drinkable given the ABV, although I probably wouldn't have more than a couple of these.
Edit: 30 May 08
Revisted many times since my initial write-up, so time for a re-review and revised score.
A - Pours a very dark reddish-brown with almost no light coming through. An initial couple of inches of frothy tan head drop to a finger thick cap. Head is very active and easily refreshed.
S - Chocolate, date, fig, cherry, molasses, cinnamon, very mild clove, leather. Definitely more in there, but can't quite distinguish it.
T - Initial flavour of slightly burnt sugar before the dates/figs arrive, and then the cherries. The spices noted in the nose then appear along with a little liquorice. Finishes with dark chocolate and a lightly drying aftertaste. Some pleasant light alcohol warmth in the aftertaste, but not even close to what would be expected from the ABV - very well masked throughout.
M - Phenomenal. Very smooth and silky. Full bodied and softly carbonated - a highlight of an already great beer.
D - Just an outstanding beer which I'll drink time and again. Drinkability? Given the 11.3% ABV it's far too easy to sip. 1,654 charactershaz77, May 07, 2006
4.58/5  rDev +2.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I bought this beer as a present to myself for completing my final final exam of my MBA. Unfortunately I dont have a big Belgian-style glass to pour it into, so Ill drink it out of the bottle. Just kidding! Its going into a wide-mouthed red wine glass. That should work.
This beer pours with a solid three-fingers worth of big, chunky tan foam that sits atop a mahogany-brown beer. Its darker than I expected, and only the smallest bits of light come through the sides of the glass.
The smell is mostly sweet. Maybe brown sugar or some rum-like sweetness. The alcohol smell is not as pronounced as I would have expected for an 11.3% brew. 
The first impression of the taste is a little creamier mouthfeel than I anticipated. Wow, thats well balanced. Maybe some raisins or plums in the taste. Also perhaps a little coffee or cocoa? Its dry, and silky smooth, and easy going down. This is 11.3? This hides it so much better than, say, a Delirium Tremens, and does so without the medicinal taste. This is much smoother than I expected. Quite complex. Different (and fantastic) flavours linger in your mouth after swallowing. A fine beer, and my first 5 on the taste. Drinkability is good, and you'll want another sip. Again, it lacks that harsh medicinal taste that's common in a lot of strong Belgiums.

4.52/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5BB 30/11/2010, served cool in a large Burgundy bulb wine glass.
A: pours a dark brown colour with ruby glows, the off-white beer head comes thick but dissipates quite fast to a thin cap, leaving uneven sheets of tight lacing; lively carbonation.
S: bouquet-perfumy and syrupy fruitiness dominates the nose--suggestions of sweet black cherries, cranberry-jam, dark candy sugar, treacles+caramel, creamy dark malts, thick fruit esters, hints of licorice+coconut-flakes+faintly cinnamon, with touches of alc. lingering in the background... all elements of aroma are rolled in one, within a syrupy and perfumy coating--very intense and focused, albeit a touch too sweet for me.
T: a flow of dark candy-sugary and dark maltiness upfront, quickly radiating lots of sweet preserved dark-fruits, fig-jam and dried dates to all corners on the palate; soft bready malts linger at the back, mixed well with a light tinge of peppery spiciness, profound fruit esters, and more treacle-ish sweetness to result in a vibrant, bitter-sweet, long aftertaste; a slightly sticky aftertaste, like fortified wine, is left in the very end, but the alc. touch hides just brilliantly.
M&D: a heavy-weight beer with 4 more years to go before its self-imposed BB date, its mouthfeel is simply sublime--mellow yet softly-carbonated to provide reasonably refreshing mouthfeel, full-flavoured with but a quiet presence of soothing alc., vertically-structured and approachable... All in all, this is a beautifully-crafted beer with great drinkability, by which I mean it deserves careful appreciation once in a short while, not having more than one bottle at a time. There's so much more to explore in this beer, I'm sure, once my experience of beers is further broadened... 1,749 characterswl0307, May 05, 2006
4.72/5  rDev +5.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Appearance: Pours a dark brown almost black liquid. The creamy tan head stacked up quite nicely and maintained about a quarter of an inch. Nice amount of laceing can be found and if you look hard through this beer you can find a few columns of beading.
Smell: The aromas are awesome!! A sweet bready character, cinnamon, licorice, some yeasty notes, and a potent alcohol. Fruits are restrained in the aroma. Can detect some berry hints such as cherries and cranberries.
Taste: The flavors, like the nose, are just simply amazing. Layered malts galore. Starts sweet then comes this wonderful doughy,bready flavor. Think it like bread fresh out of the oven. Im getting some nuttiness out this as well. Dark fruits are restrained but are there along with an almost acidic alcohol potentency. Complex at the very least.
Mouthfeel: Slick and oily substance with a heavy carbonation with a medium body. Almost spritzy but not quite. Alcohol again in the finish.
Drinkability: This was a most exeptional quaff. A MUST try. A complex beer to get your mind wondering and at the same time a beer to just take the edge off in 60 secs or less.

4.23/5  rDev -5.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Appearance: hazy dark brown color with a thick 2" head that slowly falls to a thick surface foam. Nice lacing develops.
Smell: aroma is of sweet malts and chocolates, balanced with some spicy alcohol and fruitiness. 
Taste: very malty, but other tones such as chocolate, raisins, ripe plums and other dark fruits, bits of molasses, and some honey sweetness make a bold beer. Alcohol is noticeable but not offensive as with some other quads. 
Mouthfeel: lightly crisp at the start, smooth at the finish. The flavors linger on the tongue after swallowing for a while. Medium-heavy bodied. 
Dinkability: pretty good for such a high alcohol beer. The is a well balanced slow sipper that can add an exclamation point to a evening of quaffing beers. Must have at least once. 780 charactersGavage, May 03, 2006

Deep creamy toffee, milk chocolate, and inviting caramel. Whaffs of sour cherry, green apple. A perfect balance of tartness and richness in aroma.
Creamy, rich milk chocolate and toffee. Slight acidic, fruity esters: pear and apple. Fig, dates, and a delicate nutty flavor with hints of oak. Delicate hints of warming alcohol with a creamy, chocolate aftertaste.
A rich full body. Creamy and rather active carbonation on the palate.
A very solid quadrupel that is a treat to be enjoyed. Although the flavor is solid, the aroma is the highlight here. Not my favorite for the style, but a quality offering. 754 charactersNEhophead, Apr 30, 2006
4.97/5  rDev +11.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Cloudy brown. 1 in. rocky tan colored head. Laces well considering the alcohol content. Where there isn't lace, there is plenty of legs.
Mouthwatering balsamic vinegar smell predominates. There are also underlying toasted malt and fruit aromas. Very little sense of the alcohol.
Slightly tart at first, biscuit malt taste is next. There is a sense of oiliness. There is a lingering cocoa and oak resin bitterness. I also taste fermented grapes like merlot but less tart. Finally some honeydew melon after a few sips. Raisons show up later. Each individual taste is quite subtle but the overall effect is powerful and wonderful.
The first mouthfeel sense is bubbly. Warming comes later. Finally a dryness. Everything is very smooth and subtle.
Dangerously drinkable. My heart says, "Have another and another and another." My brain says, "Save the other one to brighten another lousy day but go buy some more." 920 charactersken3c, Apr 28, 2006

Been awhile since the last time I've had this one, always a pleasure.
Poured into a chalice a nice dark brownish color, with a nice fizzy/creamy light tan head, nice carbonation, with some nice sticky lacing left behind. The nose is malty, with some very nice raisins, figs, prunes. The taste is very very nice, malty, very slight yeast note, lot's of dark fruits. Medium body, with a nice sweetness/fruity finish. Overall a very tasty brew, glad to see it here in UT for many years. Maybe I should buy it more often.

4.63/5  rDev +3.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5I poured this beer into a gold-rimmed Chimay goblet. It poured out a rich, opaque, cloudy, caramel-amber. The head was thick but settled very quickly. I could sense this beer was well-crafted by appearance alone.
The smell was pretty subtle to me at the time, mildly sweet, mildly malty.
The taste was amazing. I can't even begin to nail down all the different flavors that went on in my mouth...a bit of raisin, a bit of caramel, a bit of malt...I think I'd need to meditate for about half an hour and then drink one with my eyes closed to truly begin to get a grip of what's going on in my mouth.
Mouth feel was very pleasant. The pleasingly malty aftertaste arrived and left almost instantaneously. At times I would actually let the beer sit in my mouth for a few seconds just to preserve the flavor, because as soon as I swallowed, it was gone. There was no intrusive bitter after-effect sitting on the tongue as I've experienced with some other Belgian brews.
The bottle was small, but this beer was too good not to savor, so I actually managed to nurse it for quite awhile and allow it to bloom even more as it warmed.
This is definitely one to reserve for special occasions, not because I wouldn't love to have one every day, but because I don't want to ruin myself for all other beer. 1,307 charactersinstrumentality, Apr 19, 2006
4.05/5  rDev -9.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5Appearance: Head is gargantuan but kind of lumpy and irregular, composed mostly of great big bubbles. Body is a pretty dark chocolate ganache color, opaque as they come.
Smell: Caramel and chocolate, a faint breeze of red wine, strawberries, candy sugar, prunes (lots of prunes), cinnamon, ketchup-like glutamates... wow. Quite a lot going on.
Taste: Oh my, that's really good. The taste coming in is completely different from the taste going down. Begins spicy, with a pronounced alcohol burn that gets into every nook and cranny. Kind of raw and woody, with a subdued sweetness. The finish is amazing. The beer transforms into a mellow, peanutty, almondy, buckwheaty, unfathomably toasty malt convention with a little yeasty twang, a citric hop zip, and this incredible cocoa powder flavor. Yay!
Mouthfeel: This suffers from the abrasive alcohol problem that I dislike in many trappist ales, but the mouthfeel is still fine. The finish is especially nice, extremely clean but still flavorful.
Drinkability: The alcohol is a little much, both on the palate and on the nervous system, but it's still a damn good beer. I'd love to have one cellared. 1,160 characterssoulgrowl, Apr 18, 2006
4.4/5  rDev -1.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Pours a dark reddish brown with a thick creamy off-white head. The head settles down to form a perfect lasting cover for the body. Some lacing present. Aroma is chocolate, molases, dark fruits, with some roasted notes. Flavor is chocolate, molases, figs, candi sugar, raisins, prunes, and cookie dough. An alcohol presence comes in the middle, and lingers through the end and finish. Roasted coffee and rum come in at the end. The finish is lasting, with warm to hot alcohol. Finish is semisweet from the lingering flavors of the fruits. The texture of this brew is wonderful, silky smooth and creamy, coating with a full mouthfeel. Has a low carbonation, but still has a soft fizz on the tongue. Wonderful beer, but I think the strong alcohol presence takes away from the beauty of this beer. I definately prefered the number 8 to this. 837 charactersartusory, Apr 18, 2006

Opaque ruby dark brown with a solid finger and a half of creamy light khaki head. Nose of rummy fruits: plum, strawberry, and maybe pear. Roasted malt underside. Sweet, sugary wheat and yeast with some alcohol spice. Complex and mouth-watering. Taste starts off with sweet, sugary fruit malts. Dark-edged and ripe, but with a sugary wheat side. Roastiness settles in and gives a little balance. Hoppish bitterness follows in a crescendo that ends with loud sugary malts and spicy, warming fruit alcohol. Wow. Long finish of licorice, wheat tang, fruit esters, and roasted hop bitterness. Rocky, volatile, tingly carbonation up front. Body is full with a mouth-covering feel. An incredible beer that can be dangerously drinkable at 11.3%. 809 charactersalexgash, Apr 14, 2006
4.75/5  rDev +6.3%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4I've been waiting a long time to review this one. Bottle is labled 16 03 10 08:30...not sure what this means or when it was brewed. 
Took a little while to pour this one. Sitting in the glass it looks magnificent. Huge frothy head sitting on a dark brown body with chunks of sediment suspended throughout. 
Smells of pears, cherries, caramel, sweet malt, and some dark fruits. Very little alcohol presence in the nose. This is one complex smelling beer. 
First taste, jesus-h-christ. So much going on here. Hints of all kinds of fruits, and the alcohol presence is very little for such a strong beer. 11.3% certainly doesn't come through on this one. Very full body, coats your mouth and lingers for a while wich is a welcome, indeed. There is hardly any noticable hops, mostly caramel flavored malt. I could go on and on..
As it warms up the alcohol definitely becomes present but isn't overwhelming in the least. The head leaves lace all over the inside of the glass and retains a thin layer of bubz.
This was definitely worth the wait. I've been sitting on this one for 5 or six months and there's no telling how long it was at Kenny Road Market in Columbus. Doubtfully very long, but you never know. A world-class beer that I'm going to try to find some more of and cellar away for many years to come. 1,320 characterstrep, Apr 13, 2006
4.12/5  rDev -7.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Ah, finally a chance to try the legendary Rochefort 10, the blue cap.
Poured into a large tulip chalice, the head is a massive beast of beige sponge, thick sticky intervals of lacing. The body itself is a very deep opaque brown. Apple peel and flowers is the scent I get from it at first. It smells like lilacs to me, I'll be jiggered. Only after a while can I make out a chewy caramel malt, and the vinuous dried dark fruits. Sweet strawberry licorice as well. 
Yes sir folks, I was dissapointed with the 6, and somewhat with the 8, but this here is a winner. Mellow flavour at first for the alcohol content, figs and a bit of alcohol up front, quite mild, surprisingly so. Caramel malt starts to creep out over the hump of the middle already, where the flavour is also very floral. The finish is of roasted malt and carmelized sugar, and very dry in fact, almost musty. The aftertaste also carries a dry musty character. 
Definitely a lot of sweetness in the middle though, I pick that up the more I sip it, caramel and red licorice.
Curious dry mouthfeel, and light in texture, although the warmth of the alcohol is present throughout. And I'm beginning to feel the effects of the abv% as well.
An ale that I'll definitely pick up more of, but one in a sitting is more than enough to satiate me. And I thoroughly enjoyed the scent of lilacs down to the bottom of the glass. Truly a noteworthy ale. 1,413 charactersIronDjinn, Apr 13, 2006

Looks like a Belgian Quad.. Deep brown, bordering black, non transparent with a small head. Smell is great. Ripe fruits, alcohol and bready malts dominate.

4.7/5  rDev +5.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Finally available in Alberta after almost a year of liquor stores and agents talking about bringing it in. The simple blue and yellow label makes a nice looking bottle, especially with the blue/purple cap with the 10 on it. A small white label on the back shows the local distributor: Horizon Wines. Thanks guys. 
The first aroma I get as soon as I pop the cap is musty green apple. The beer is a very dark garnet, and not transparent in the least. Near-black colouration actually. The head stayed solid as a nice thick layer of light brown, tight foam. It dimpled slightly but showed no signs of lessening at all. Thick styrofoam lacing that did not slide. World-class looking beer. The aroma is quite sweet up front, like fresh red grapes. Light nuttiness and dusty malts from above the rim of my chalice glass. The smell is even more sugary in close, but always under the veil of the musty yeast which softens and adds a table-cream nuance. The fruits are here: initially a little apple, then red grapes, pear, pineapple(yes), prunes, dates, figs, even light peach. Sniffing very closely gives the spicy phenols and some solvent alcohol. I find the earthy smell increases as the beer warms. Superbly complex malts. A new aroma with every tilt of the glass. As true with most of the great beers, there is a certain indescribable part of the nose too--almost a soft wood smell, or tree sap, maybe pine needles and a little clove? Almost medicinal at times, and it can be numbing to the nose after a bit, so take your time with this beast. In the background seems to float a little dried-beer aroma, like the smell of some beer in the bottom of a glass discovered the next day. Some roasted characteristics here too, but the malts are very creamy and soft, with little harshness. And for an 11% quadrupel, the alcohol is never overpowering. A definite cornucopia of aromas here though; incredible. The mouthfeel of this beer is layered in duplicity. It is full yet feels like whipped cream on the tongue. Delicate carbonation, and an intensely creamy texture. The first taste in the mouth is of some very deceivingly light malts, roasted but not bitter. The beer in the front of the mouth actually has very little flavour--the tip of my tongue registers more of its FEEL rather than its TASTE. In the middle comes some savoury maple, some brown sugar, a little milk chocolate, musty tannin-like dryness, and caramel cake. The alcohol shows itself a little near the end, but this tastes not even remotely close to a an over-11% ale. The malting is absolutely incredible: sweet, wine-like and filled with fresh bread and toffee/caramel flavours. The malts are not so much meaty as refined and balanced perfectly. The flavour exudes age, earthiness and dust. Any hopping is undetectable, and any dryness in the finish comes from the dark malts. This goes through the gullet to the stomach rather quickly; dangerously so. The 10 definitely warms the insides rapidly. This would be brilliant for a cold winter beer. Give me this over brandy or port anyday. Absolute liquid ambrosia here. Better than St Bernie 12 for me personally(the 12 has too much apple in the aroma). I am ecstatic to finally have this available in our province. 3,231 charactersCwrw, Apr 08, 2006
4.5/5  rDev +0.7%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 3.5I must admit that I am very excited to get this beer. The only other quadrupel I've had a taste of is St. Bernardus, and if that is any indication, I am in for a treat.
This one pours beautifully into my Trois Pistoles chalice. Nearly opaque, deep brown that almost seems purple with a thick creamy tan coloured head. So creamy that if I didn't know better, I could be convinced that it was a nitro pour. I don't think I've ever rated a 5 for appearance. Now I have.
The smell is a wonderful thing as well. Bananas and cream, icing sugar, fresh melon, more banana, black pepper and root beer. I could spend a lot of time just looking at and smelling this beer.
The greatest impression made by the first mouthfull is an alcohol burn that lasts well after the beer is swallowed. Sambuca like licorice taste fills most of the back of the mouth. The front is more subtle, perhaps even overpowered by the finish. Faint berries to banana run over the first half of the tongue. To be honest, I wish the finish would be toned down a bit, to allow me to enjoy more of the other flavours. I had to add: on the very last gulp, half beer and half head, the taste of marshmellow appeared. Delicious.
The mouthfeel is thick and creamy, with plenty of carbonation that only adds to the effect. I would not change a thing here.
This is a great beer, no surprise there. I do prefer the alcohol to be better hidden in beers of this strength, and that has cost it some points overall. I suggest a deep breath through the nose each time you take a sip, just to take in as much of this beer's essence as possible. 1,607 characterselricorico, Apr 08, 2006

It's dry but unlike the 8 it has an alco taste. Apart from that it has the same licorice body. A great beer but I can't decide if I prefer the 8 before the 10. 515 charactersJanM, Apr 07, 2006

Smell is sugar laden with fine herbal notes, berries and an alcohol undercurrent. This brew has a very creamy mouthfeel while yielding a medium body. Quite complex flavors that range from mild smoky chocolate undertones to sweet ripened fruit. Perfectly at home on the palate, this brew ends with a warming sensation as the alcohol hits the stomach. Top notch stuff that deserves a sip to sip attention.. 521 characterssinistermadman, Apr 06, 2006
4.05/5  rDev -9.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Poured with a quickly diminishing tan head at cellar temperature into a Leffe glass (oh the shame). Appearence is reasonably cloudy (possibly from a slightly quick pour). Aroma of ripe fruits with malt laced with alcohol. Tasted very rich and fruity, with a sweet malty lingering finish and alcohol warming the throat and mouth. Mouthfeel is smooth but with a surprisingly lively carbonation. Definately a 'sip and savour' beer - one for those cold evenings when the rain is lashing against the windows. Possibly a bit too sweet for my liking, but I look forward to trying the other Rochefort brews. 599 charactersNermal, Apr 03, 2006
5/5  rDev +11.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5It's been a long time since I have reviewed so here goes. What a beer to come back to? Rochefort 10 is quite possibly the greatest beer I have EVER tasted. Pours a cloudy chocolate brown I am guessing from the yeast in the bottle. The head this thick and creamy with good lacing throughout. The smell is outstanding. There is everything from caramel to dried fruits (raisens dates etc) There is also a strong alcohol aroma but it just strong enough and not too strong. The taste is where this beer really stands out. It has everything you could want. It's smooth it has a myriad of flavors to explore (very woody as well as the fruits and nuts taste). The drinkability is perfect but one could easily be 3 sheets to wind in a very short amount of time on this tasty but potent brew. 782 charactersrustymoore, Apr 03, 2006
4.79/5  rDev +7.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Appearance: Pours a very dark deep garnet color. There are so many bubbles rising at first that I can't tell just how clear it is. I was careful not to get any of the sediment from the bottom of the bottle. The beer initially had a 1/4" head of tannish bubbles on top that fell to a small ring around the top of the beer within a minute or two. There is some noticeable lacing on the glass after the beer is removed.
Aroma: Initially I get a whole bunch of dark ripe fruit like plums and black cherries. There is a really complex and rich woody or earthy aroma that almost gives it a root beer aroma. There is a very assertive sweet chocolate aroma that mixes well with the other fruits. This beer smells great!...like it is a really complex soda pop. There are some bready notes coming out from the yeast as it warms; as well, there is a more noticeable floral character coming to the forefront.
Taste: Oh my God this beer is smooth! It would have to be a beer made by monks for your first exclamation to be "oh my God". It has a really rich fruitiness that is almost too complicated to describe. The beer is extremely well balanced. The fruitiness is probably the first thing you notice along with the richness of the malt and sugars. The fruits follow the aroma pretty well in that they are dark with cherries and others. There seems to be a dry almost wheaty edge to it that makes it really drinkable. There is a bunch of malt, but the attenuation is such that it is dangerously drinkable. I can't really pick out any hops in here in particular, but I am sure that they are adding to the floral and fruity thing this beer has going on. The finish is definitely balanced toward the malt/sweetness. You can't pick out the 11+% alcohol in this beer at all. About the only indication of its strength is a subtle warming you get on the back of the throat long after the sip...but it is hard to wait that long.
Opinion: Well, obviously I really like this beer! It is a work of art, and one that I would highly recommend. It is a bit pricey, but well worth it. It is so drinkable and unique among even the Belgian brewers, that I will be indulging in this delicacy as much as financially permissible in the future. 2,220 charactersSkeeterHawk, Apr 02, 2006

11.2 oz brown bottle

* Split the bottle & enjoyed with LB * 
Pours a ruby brown chestnut shade of beauty. Incredibly vibrant beer with a crazy, foamy head. Awesome trails of sticky lace patterns.
Interesting nose with whiffs of sweet malts, figs and light funk.
Sweet, rich juicy malts up front with hints of plums and raisins. Tight Belgian yeast flavors intertwined with dark fruits. The mouthfeel is incredibly smooth and creamy. The drinkability is unreal. Extremely drinkable at a surprising 11.3% ABV. 
For my pure palate satisfaction and enjoyment, this is as good as good as I've had. In terms of complexity and depth, I think this beer can rival a great deal of fine wines on the market. It's beers like Trappistes Rochefort 10 that validate my love and appreciation for beer. 859 charactersHibernator, Apr 02, 2006

4.03/5  rDev -9.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Pours a deep copper color with a thick & dense two finger tan cap. Cap settled into ridges to a one finger cap leaving lacings up the side. Fruity esters in the aroma along with molasses, bubblegum and raisins. A very slight diacetyl . Alcohol is on the nose. Flavor comes through with a syrupy sweetness to almost chew on. Fruity with raisins and has a vinous quality. Not quite the depth of flavor I was looking for. Alcohol is apparent at first, but goes away after a few sips. Nice charcoal hop bitterness. Carbonation is medium and finishes dry. Very good beer! 566 charactersjabocu, Mar 29, 2006

Poured a very very nice looking frothy brown color with not much of a head, but a near perfect lace that was there till the end. This beer had a cloudyness to it that almost made it look like a brown slush puppy...it was almost too pretty to drink. Smell was of many dark fruits...figs and prunes were the most dominant for me. There was also some vanilla aromas and a slight whiskeyish smell lingering here and there as well. Taste brought out the dark fruit even more, especially as it warmed. I also picked up on some sherry and molasses flavors that were excellent. Mouthfeel was relatively heavy, starting off very juicy and ending with a slight tart twang. Carbonation was a bit high, but not bad by any means. It is a very syrupy beer but still easy to drink....I could see myself drinking a few of these easily enough. A wonderful beer, those monks are doing something right. Cheers 945 charactersjamie2dope, Mar 26, 2006

Oh wow, what an aroma-- this is fresh, delicious! Brown sugar, dark fruits, vanilla yogurt-- I could spend a while just sniffing this. On the palate, a glorious melding of flavors unfolds: dark malt, fruits, followed by a sharp bitter finish that mingles with some malt astringency. At this point the alcohol begins to warm the throat and gut as it wafts up into the nostrils -- let us not forget that this baby weighs in at 11.3% ABV. 
Rochefort 10 is a superior experience. The complexity is so great-- it's hard to tease apart the constituent aromas and flavors. This is quite the brew. 648 charactersVoodooBrew, Mar 23, 2006

Dark ruby-tinted brown color, with a small initial head that fades fast. Dark fruits and a huge bouquet of malt dominates the nose, with notes of toasty caramel. Much more malty than many abbey styles, this has big roasted, dark-chocolate flavors, with lighty spicy bitterness and a noticible alcoholic pepperiness. Finish is lingeringly bitter, but as much from roasty malt as hoppy bitterness. Substantial body, with a luscious, creamy mouthfeel.

first sip is sweet caramel, ginger and alcohol. instantly warming. dark grainy bread, some wood and anise as well. after warming and drinking more collected yeast, i get a cinnamony christmas spice cake. just delicious. aftertaste is yeasy with dark crusty bread hanging around long after the swallow. mouthfeel is initially excellent. creamy heavy body that expands in your mouth and coats your throat for a super-smooth swallow. does thin, though as time goes by. sip this quad. heavy alcohol so you wouldn't want to drink quickly anyways. very easy to take the time to enjoy this one. overall, i would have this one dead even with westy 12. i can't accurately say which i'd prefer, but based on what i remember, i'd put them both behind st. bernardus 12. one day i'll do a vertical and may be able to accurately adjust my ratings, but to make a long story short: absolutely excellent quadrupel. a must try. 1,335 charactersPx2GrafX, Mar 22, 2006

"damn dude" my roommate just uttered, i said "wow" what a perfect beer. the flavor is so complex, i couldnt list all the tastes with the short average lifespan of humans. the first thing that goes from tongue to brain is a chocolatey/raisiny taste.

Finishes nice light spice clove, pepper very good brew until the end little too much noticeable alcohol presence mixed with a little too much carbonation for me.
Mouthfeel is great rich thick lots of malt great until the finish just too much fiz so nocked it down a notch.
Drinkability is ok great aroma nice big flavors very tasty the finish just makes it good instead of great. Noticeable alcohol that doesn't seem to blend plus a little too much zest for my tastes. Still pretty good brew though. 952 charactersmntlover, Mar 14, 2006

I hadn't drunk this beer in a while, and let me say that I had forgotten how much I love it.
Appearance: A reddish brown-tinged creamy 2-finger head tops an impenetrably deep, dark, brown beer with ruby hints near the edges of the glass. A wonder to behold.
Aroma: Molasses, caramelized sugar, raisins, plums, chocolate. Similar to Rochefort 8, but more complex.
Taste: Very complex, a bit difficult to discern individual elements of the taste. Malt is forward, with chocolate following closely behind. Sweet. Caramel, molasses, licorice, raisins. Very light alcohol flavor. Absolutely delicious.
Mouthfeel: Medium body, carbonation levels definitely an improvement over the over-carbonated 8. Glides easily past my lips, over my tongue, and down the hatch. 
Overrall: At 11.3% one can imagine that this is a sipper, and it is. But it is so delicious that I would gladly sip a second. 942 characterschuchoteur, Mar 13, 2006
4.53/5  rDev +1.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured into a goblet.... dark cola appearance with a monstrous 1" rocky light beige head. Darker than I'm used to from quads, but still gorgeous. Tons of lacing... nice.
Big berry aroma with a significant alcohol presence... lots of plum, cherry, even a bit of toffee.
Big alcohol flavour... gets very much up in the nose. Extraordinarily complex... some nuttiness, malt, cherry, plum, as well as a fair amount of crisp yeastiness. Quite nice.
Big thick mouthfeel with a moderate amount of carbonation.... just perfect for this style.
While the alcohol is noticeable in the flavour, it certainly is not so 'in-your-face' that it hurts the drinkablility. For an 11.3% brew, this one is sneaky. While I think I prefer Abt. 12 to this brew, they are both classics, and exceptional for their style. 806 charactersnickss, Mar 12, 2006
3.06/5  rDev -31.5%look: 4 | smell: 3 | taste: 3 | feel: 3 |  overall: 3Hooray! Finally, I get to put my Trappistes Rochefort chalice to its intended use.
From a 330ml bottle, Rochefort 10 pours a velvety brown with tiny gold highlights; Soon a mochalike froth of a head builds, and the last tilt of the bottle is met with a stream of delicious belgian brown sediment. The head leaves little lacing, and remains as a soapy ring around the murky brown surface.
Smells of raisins and slight sugar are drowned out by oaky alcohol scents - whiskey dominated. Not as strong of a scent as I've come to expect from a quadrupel, especially given the chalice, intended to capture all those scents and offer them up to the nose.
The flavor peaks with a lot more whiskey - There are some grassy tones, and very, very slight cherry, but alcohol and oak are dominant. I absolutely despise whiskey, so this really isn't the flavor for me. The flavor is actually a little watery for a quadrupel, so it reminds me unpleasantly of a whiskey and water.
Mouthfeel is zesty with carbonation, lively, if you will, and rather light. It finishes extremely dry, the alcohol stripping everything from the palate.
I'm uncharacteristically dissappointed in this one - my palate just doesn't like the flavors and experiences it provides very much. I won't rate it lower than average, because I understand that it's my mouth's problem, not the beer's. Your milage may vary. 1,387 charactersTupperwolf, Mar 12, 2006

The fruity eshters and sweet malt linger for a long time. The Head is tight laced and long lasting. The mouth is strong coffee and cocoa with a hint of raisin and licorice, but they are only subtle. The finish is somewhat dry and still long lasting. The coffee and trace amount of fruit from the hops/malt stick around for a while. 424 charactersmarinobrew, Mar 11, 2006
4.36/5  rDev -2.5%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4It's Friday, it's springtime...bring on the high gravity Belgian ales.
Poured into a Trappistes Rochefort goblet. Got a rocky, creamy, very thick head that retained well. Just one black shade less than your typical black-as-hell stout. Call it ultra-ultra-dark brown. Lots and lots of lace.
Considering the complex flavor, this has a more subtle aroma than expected. Faint wafts of hops and alcohol arrive first, with toasted, almost burnt malts following.
A light smokiness appears first, then alcohols and an almost burnt malt flavor, all taken over quickly by a mellow raisin/prune sweetness. But then the alcohol returns. Depending on the temperature, the alcohol can take over a bit, so I try to stick with the suggested minimum of about 54 F. If you can't control the temp so much, it's still a fine, fine experience.
Mouthfeel is exceptional: creamy, slightly carbonated, a tiny bit of weight to it as it swirls around, a real delight. I try and keep it in the mouth as long as possible.
My only problem with this one is not the high ABV (bring it on) but how the alcohol dominates the flavor a bit too much. This is a unique ale, in that I tend to taste and feel it differently every time. But it's always above average to one degree or another. 1,258 charactersMetalmonk, Mar 11, 2006
4.23/5  rDev -5.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3 |  overall: 4.5This time down in Atlantic City, I decided to treat myself at Firewaters.
Date on the bottle says 05.10.10 meaning this bottle was about 10 months old. The pour was very, very nice. Deep brown and ruby color with a creamy 2-finger tan head. The aroma was not as complex as I expected it to be. Dark malts, chocolate, and a little bit of raisin. The taste really brought the flavors out more. I thought the chocolate and fruitiness really shined here. The flavor certainly improves as the beer warms to ambient temperatures. Very rich with an alcoholic bite that does not go unnoticed. The mouthfeel was my least favorite part of the beer. I felt that the carbonation was a too high making it a little thin in body and leaving a fizzy feeling on my tongue. I was craving that thick, full-bodied feeling and it just wasn't there. Despite that, the drinkability is high. But be careful, the ABV is high and it certainly wants you to know it's there as I can honestly say that this beer knocked me on my ass a bit.
I would definitely recommend this beer to anybody, even though the high carbonation didn't make this beer as enjoyable as I thought it would be. I could see how laying this beer down for a year or two would really help make it more complex. 1,257 charactersJacobob10, Mar 09, 2006
4.63/5  rDev +3.6%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Poured into my Samiclaus tulip at cellar temp. Dark brown with ruby red highlights, and an offwhite head imerges and slowly dissapates. Sheets of lace don't even describe this. A solid blanket of lacing forms around the entire glass. 
The aroma here is incredible. dark cherries, plums, figs, raisins, mild coffee, malt, caramel, and freshly baked pastries.
Flavor is equally superb, showing more dark fruit, baked pies, caramel, and a hint of chocolate. There is a considerable malty sweetness, but it is not to the point of being cloying. Mouthfeel is full and oily, while tiny bubles lift the flavors off your tongue. flavor lingers quite a while.
Drinkability get a point off because you just simply don't want this glass to be empty. Sip, savor, and fully enjoy each drop. Simply outstanding. 806 charactersphisig137, Mar 08, 2006

the pour yields a mahogany colored ale upon which rests a thin foamy, off-white cap. lots of floaties in this one.
very aromatic, sweet and spicy smelling while giving off notes of the darker fruits (figs, raisins, prunes), cocoa, and hints of black pepper and clove. some noticeable diacetyl and a whiff of alcohol too...
leaves streaks as i drink but no sticky lacing remains.
the taste comes off a bit dry and sour at first (brett?), but sweetens up a bit with repeated sips. flavors of apple, molasses, burnt candy sugar, anise and an alcoholic finish. this is a complex brew here, and it's character and strength are revealed slowly and subtlely as it warms in my glass. 
it starts sweet, with a malty, alcoholic middle and finishes with a touch of dryness which just begs for another sip.
mouthfeel is a medium/full and a bit chewy with good carbonation.
the alcohol kicks in rather readily and the complexity lends a richness so i'm not sure i'd wanna do more than one of these (probably as a nightcap) but it is freaking tasty.
a brew worthy of it's reputation. 1,249 charactersunclederby, Mar 07, 2006

Some streams of carbonation seen rising throughout. Smell of dark fruit (plums, raisins), some malt and sweetness.
Taste is sweet, fruity, some malt flavors, little hop bitterness. Later, still more sweetness, then the alcohol makes its presence known, but never becomes overwhelming but lends some spiciness. Lingering taste is of sweet fruits and malts. Mouthfeel is creamy, smooth, with carbonation making it feel a little lighter than otherwise, but still quite full-bodied.
Wow. This is a meal in a bottle and a real treat to sip. Will definitely try this again. Richness and high ABV limit this to one in an evening and cost with limit how often I try this beer. This is my first quad and definitely will be hard to beat. 851 characterstkarsies, Mar 06, 2006

huge belgian smells. fruity, yeast, alcohol ...s'mores? smells very sweet, complex, hard to describe. raspberry chocolate, plum wine. some hints of malted milk, whoppers. maybe even a tiny hint of coffee roasty stout malt. wow this is one serious mother quaffer. 
taste brings more surprises, including a dry bitter finish. high abv is very obvious, but works with the flavor, isn't too distracting. big, full-bodied chewy mouthfeel. this is way more intense than the couple of quadrupels i've had so far, and a great example of a beer being so solid and powerful it can stand on its own. i'll take one of these with nothing else. no food or smoke, just a bottle and a glass, this beer kicks ass. 1,075 charactersdavidchollar, Mar 05, 2006

T - Malty, sweet, bready, fruity- a meal in a bottle. This is the best beer to date for me.
M - Creamy and warm, sipping and holding, sipping and holding..
D - Smooth - you don't realize this is 11.3%. An exceptional experience.
I think this is my new #1. 593 charactersdjeffbee, Feb 21, 2006
4.04/5  rDev -9.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 3 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Poured into my Westy chalice, which is MUCH easier to find than any of their actual ales...
A:
Opaque brown, except when held up to a bright light: this gives a warm, deep glowing amber color. The two-finger head is very static, and has almost the same color as the label on the bottle. It leaves thick rings in the glass that gradually form tight lacing.
S:
Sweet caramel. Dark malts. Not much else comes to mind. Not bad, just undistinguished.
T:
Somewhat drier than the nose indicates. Finish is reminiscent of tobacco somehow, followed by warming alcohol. Leaves a pleasant, mildy acidic taste behind. As it warms, the ale becomes sweeter and more palatable.
M:
Smooth, slightly tingly carbonation. Gradually begins to feel more viscous. 
D:
Very high, so long as you take small sips, and space them well. I learned this about halfway through. If you don't, the alcohol builds on your palate and hurts the taste. 936 charactersmjc410, Feb 20, 2006
4.25/5  rDev -4.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Tasted this at Christmas 05, but reviewed this bottle on 18th Feb 06. 
Poured (into a Chimay chalice) a brown cloudy soup (is there a touch of purple there?) with a decent head considering the alcohol.
Smell is of malts, figs (?), really good.
The taste is very complex, there is so much going on that I don't know where to start; malts, fruits (plums), resin, phenols. Each sip reminds me of something different, - a real conversation stopper!
This is a serious sipping beer, I can feel the alcohol warming! To be partaken of on special occasions, a real treat! 568 charactersJohnfromDublin, Feb 20, 2006
3.77/5  rDev -15.7%look: 3 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4After hearing this beer described and referenced a lot as of late I decided to pick up a bottle to decide for myself. Thsi was a very nice quadruple. 
The smell is honey, citrus and oak blended very invitingly. 
The color is a nice reddish brown. Some sediment at the bottom of the bottle, some in the bottle. I'd say that was due to the 60 mile trip and not enough time to let things settle down. Hard to wait to long on this brew.
Taste is a nice mix of apple, peach, cinamon, robust malt and belgian candy. Definitely a warming feeling from the alcohol but not a bad addition to the taste, let's you know it's there. 
$8 for a 12oz bottle. A very nice treat, but the price is a bit high to make it more than an occaisonal treat. Aside from the price I would definitely recommend this to anyone who would like to sample a good begium quadrupple. 859 charactersbarleywinebrewer, Feb 13, 2006
4.87/5  rDev +8.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5330 ml bottle. Rochefort 10 pours out an impenetrable dark brown color with a large head that fades to a thin layer of foam. Rich, malty aroma. Amazing aroma come from this brew as it warms: chocolate, toffee, dark fruits, hazlenuts, grapes. The flavor is quite malty and spicy, but not overpowering. The subtle flavors are still able to come through. Pears, grapes, chocolate, bread, and hazlenuts. Little bitterness. Alcohol is noticable, but this is way more drinkable than any 11.3% beer deserves to be. Mouthfeel is creamy. Great complexity and flavor. This is one of the best beers in the world. 601 charactersbeveragecaptain, Feb 09, 2006
5/5  rDev +11.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This is the greatest beer in the world. The flavor profile is so complex, with chocolate, fruity, spicey notes all going on, but yet perfectly balanced. I first had this beer in a cafe in Brussels, and it was perfect. I have since had it here in the United States many times, and it makes the journey pretty good, although it is better when handled and stored properly over its life. It is very consistant from bottle to bottle. 428 charactersHutson, Feb 07, 2006
4.85/5  rDev +8.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 533 cL bottle poured into an oversized wine glass. Thick, opaque cloudy coffee. Fizzy grayish yellow head that quickly settles to a thin cap. Aromas of cherries, figs, raisins -- all drowining in cognac; caramel malts and a suggestion of anise. Big, alcoholic brandy flavor. Cherry cordials and date sugar sweetness. I kept thinking that this is what I'd expect a Belgian Barleywine to taste like. Viscous mouthfeel, oily and creamy at once with fluffy carbonation. This is absolutely one of the best beers I've ever tasted. An indulgence worth every penny. 556 charactersorfeu, Feb 07, 2006

I could drink this anytime anyplace. This is a full bodied beer with an oily alcohol texture. Has a touch of a sweet finish, but its very good. I love this beer. 450 charactersBirdiebeagle, Feb 05, 2006
3.82/5  rDev -14.5%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5Pours a murky, particle-filled deep brown color with a tan head that retreats quickly. The appearance might put some people off but, I on the otherhand, tend to like the murky cloudy brews.
 Initially the smell is alcohol with an earthy, nutty feel. As it warms the scent becomes more complex. The alcohol gives way to fresh breads, ripened fruit and a toffee-like sweetness.
 The taste is similar to the smell, with the sweetness being less prevalent in the flavor. A slight bitter finish with the warming feel of alcohol as it goes down.
 At 11.3% ABV this is a sipper or nightcap for me. 600 charactersEvilKeith, Jan 29, 2006
3.91/5  rDev -12.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Purchased from Strong Bros. Liquor, Fayetteville, TN.
Pours a dark woody brown color, so opaque that it almost turns to black. Thick slightly off-white head that sticks around for the count tops the beer in this goblet. Very nice presentation.
Very nutty aroma, cold, dark, and inviting. Slight woodsy impression. 
Flavor mostly fruity and nutty, with a strong astringency and alcoholic phenols. As the beer warms, the alcohol fades into the background and aftertaste, leaving a fruitier and nuttier profile. Very pleasant to drink. 
Mouthfeel thick. Low carbonation, but the strong alcohol flavor leaves the palate with quite a punch. No hops present, but it's a nice kick to the teeth.
Overall drinkability pretty high, especially for a beer this high in abv. At seven dollars a bottle it's not going to be a staple of my beer diet, but it's a really good beer that I will be drinking again. Makes me want to try some more Quadrupels, that's for sure. 968 charactersdanielharper, Jan 29, 2006

Smell - Smell's simply amazing, like fruitcake with a hint of alcohol in it. No other way I can describe it. The fruit scents mesh with a slight bready scent and its great!
Taste - Tastes like ripened dark fruits. A nice bitter finish to it. As it warmed up slightly bready taste came out. The alcohol is noticeable in the finish but its pleasent.
Mouthfeel - Rather smooth and warming. Tingly from the carbonation and alcohol.
Drinkability - I wouldnt have more then 1 of these in a night since it is a bit spendy to stock up on, but the one I have is goin down really well. I've been lukewarm on many belgian beers, but this one is unlike any other quadrupel I have ever had. Really drinkable. 780 charactersIguana, Jan 29, 2006

4.4/5  rDev -1.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4.5After a careful pour (to keep the black clumps of yeast in the bottom of the bottle), a deep red bordering on a plum colored beer with a thin tan head fills the glass. The film-like head is sticking around as I drink, leaving a little lace on the sides of the chalice.
The aroma of this beer is quite rich with dark fruit and vinous alcohol. 
The taste is very similar to the smell. The fruitiness is very apparent; Im reminded of grapes and figs. There is an alcohol spiciness that is much more prominent in this beer than in other Quadruples Ive tried. Something about this beer seems very wine-like. Very good and very unique.
The mouth feel is adequate. Its a bit thinner than I expected. It doesnt have the creaminess of, say, St. Bernardus Abt 12.
The drinkabilty of this beer is excellentso rich and delicious, after one sip I immediately want another. 881 charactersmaggotbrain, Jan 23, 2006
4.39/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.5As soon as the cap was cracked, the room filled with the smell of malts, raisins, maple syrup, and cherries. Wonderful!
Pours out at 100% foam. No joke. Poured out maybe 1/10th of the bottle, and the *entire glass* was foam, it took a few minutes for liquid to appear as the foam slowly subsided. And I do mean slowly, this is one thick head. Eventually faded to a murky, ruddy amber.
Taste is extremely complex. Hints of toasted malts and sourdough, with some cinnamon, raisins, and rum throughout. Wonderfully made.
Mouthfeel is syrupy and slightly astringent, but immediately explodes in carbonation, leaving a tingle all along the tongue as it foams its way back. Leaves a sweet aftertaste.
With the complexity, richness, and ABV of this beer, one bottle is good enough for me. But it will make an excellent 'special occaision' beer. 849 characterswaldowin, Jan 20, 2006
4.87/5  rDev +8.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Review #100
Decided to make #100 something special, and Rochefort 10 seemed to be a good choice. 
Dark brown cloudy in color. The tan head has the creamiest texture I've ever seen on a head. 
Smell is where things start to get interesting. Smells from all over the place, bready malt, sour yeast, plums, raisins and other dark fruits, alcohol and just tons of other stuff.
Taste, ohhhh so good. What a solid beer. Bread and biscuit backbone with some yeasty overtones and then the fruit comes through in the end. The alcohol is well hidden but warms you as you drink. 
Smooth is the best way to describe mouthfeel. Any aftertaste that is present is enjoyable and makes you want to take your next sip. 
This is a classic and lives up to its hype. A must try for anyone who really wants to learn to appreciate what beer can be. Just a great drinking experience that is enjoyment from the first sniff to the last swallow. 936 charactersbeermanbrian, Jan 18, 2006
3.68/5  rDev -17.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5Poured into a tulip it forms a huge mountainous head that slowly fades to some ring lacing. Dark brown in color and tons of super fine carbonation. Serving as a nightcapper this perfectly clear Monday night.
On the light side of things it has some orange citrus taste to it, on the darker side of things its candied and almost farmhous like, It has a bit of an odd musky side that really makes this unique. The sweetness is well balanced and kept in check. Alcohol comes through bigtime in the finish....warming is huge.
One of my best friends favorite beers. If its on the menu this brew is in her glass. I tend to think this beer is one of the more "overrated" beers on BA but don't take that the wrong way. Its a fine brew but to my taste buds its an above average Quad. 779 charactersDogFood11, Jan 17, 2006
4.78/5  rDev +6.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Appearance is perfect - murky brown with suspended yeast particles - I poured about half the yeast in just for the hell of it. The head is a never ending cream colored affair that doesn't even dissipate enough to let me see the beer through the top of the glass. That's amazing. 
Smell is deeply indulgent - exotic spices, banana, rum, and cookie dough are in there along with some medicinal alcohol.
On the first sip, the incredible smoothness is what strikes you first. It's also surprisingly effervescent which mean this never gets sticky or bogged down, even as I'm finishing the bottle (sadly).
The taste is perfection in a bottle - every sip is different. At first the peppery spiciness stands out. Then the malt really opens up and the deep dark fruit (plum) tastes come out along with some brown sugar. At times this tastes like pumpkin pie. Spiced rum is always in the background, but the alcohol doesn't make much of an appearance in the taste. Just spectacular.
Overall, this is one hell of a beer. I will be purchasing much more, even at $6+ per bottle. 1,077 charactersPatYoda, Jan 17, 2006

The smell is amazing. It fills the entire room. Citrusy at first crack of the bottle. As I pour it out, it is a bit more earthy and yeasty. Has a nice fruity aroma. This has a very earthy taste. Not as fruity/estery as the smell. And a great kick of alcohol warms my mouth and throat. The roasted maltiness is just bitter and sweet enough. Quite delicious, but slightly less complex than I expected. This is probably the best mouthfeel on a beer I have ever had. Normally I rate mouthfeel half heartedly, but this one is full, huge carbonation and a nice smooth velvety finish with the alcohol warmth to boot. Just a fantastic beer to the end of a long day. 779 characterscracgor, Jan 06, 2006

The taste explodes in the mouth with maple, raisin, and a tiny bit of horsiness. This is a very sugary beer, lots of sweetness lingering in the back of the mouth. There is a definite feel of alcohol, not surprising given the abv. This is very pleasant going down. One of the more drinkable Belgian strong ales I've tasted. 456 charactersCalico, Jan 05, 2006

Nose was also top notch, liqourice comes to mind first followed by a healthy serving of alcohol which was no surprise at this abv, also some very sweet candylike notes as well. Taste for me was OK. I really must admit that I had high hopes but this wasn't bad by any means just not as I expected. immediate big flavor but spicy tingly alchohol pretty much dominates the whole way through. Not unpleasant by any means, some slight hints at Oaky woodiness in the background but the alcohol is the main component here. Overall a good high ABV beer which is pleasant tasting and gorgeous, but it didn't blow me away by any means. 736 charactersmasikon, Jan 05, 2006

4.18/5  rDev -6.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5(Served in a chalice)
A- This beer has a deep opaque brown body with a big creamy tan head that last and last. It has nice lacing with each sip. No carbonation visible but the head is still going. 
S- During the pour I thought I smelled a strong banana aroma but I don't detect that anymore. The smell of dark caramel and brown sugar come through with a hint of dates. 
T- The taste of dark sugar is not sweet but it really blends with a light grain flavor in the background. Some notes of dates and raisins finish with a soft alcohol kick. 
M- The head is still going and it gives the mouthfeel a creamy texture and a full mouthfeel. There is a nice alcohol warmth in the finish. 
D- This is a well balanced beer with all the flavors melding and the alcohol is a nice balance to the grain and sugars. I usually don't taste dates but more of a raisin flavor but this was a nice difference. It goes down very smooth for a 11.3 ABV. 945 charactersrhoadsrage, Jan 03, 2006
2.85/5  rDev -36.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 2 | feel: 3 |  overall: 2This Quad has a thick cloudy brown color with a heavy thick even light brown head. The smell is rich with fermented fruit. The taste is lighter than expected. It has an ethereal aftertaste and a warming effect probably due to the high alcohol content. A bit nutty but far more sterile than I would have hoped for in a good Belgium beer. It has all the tags to be a great beer but it lacks a full flavor. Perhaps the 6 or the 8 will have a more intact flavor. Seems, overly fermented? 487 charactersTheEclecticGent, Dec 31, 2005

Pours light to medium brown in color. Looks darker brown in the glass. Foam develops and fills over half the glass. Carbonation bubbles appear large in size. Aroma through lots of foam is of nuts and spices. Taste is a litle of cardboard perhaps damaged in the shipment? Mouthfeel is exquisite, very silky smooth. Taste is of nuts, very subdued not overpowering in any way. Taste is a little like grapeseed. This reminds me of Westy 12 a little bit. High ABV is hidden very well. No alcohol burn. A little bit of evaporating alcohol if held on the tongue for a while. 656 charactersmjohn27603, Dec 31, 2005

Appears murky dark brown with a small tan head. The aroma is complex and of raisins, spices, belgian yeast, chocolate, cocoa and fresh fruit (bananas, oranges). There is a huge sweet chocolatey malt flavour. Tastes of dark dried fruits (raisins), brown sugar, spices (allspice) and has a warming alcoholic finish. The mouthfeel is full, thick and smooth. Had Rochefort 10 a few times now and it has a lot going on. An outstanding, complex and warming beer. Always the right choice at the Belgian Beer Cafe in Perth. 555 charactersohitsbrad, Dec 29, 2005
4.72/5  rDev +5.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4This beer poured a deep and dusty brown and had an average light colored head. There was quite a lot of floating brown yeasty bits, but that's ok. Both the smell and taste evolved a great deal during my glass, so I will try to elaborate...
The smell started as mainly yeast, while the flavor was mainly that of brown or candy sugar.
 The smell evolved and took on more malty scents, and then dates and raisins toward the end.
The flavor stayed very sweet through out, but eventually took on similar dark fruit flavors combined with hops, some deep yeast and malt flavors, and towards the last two sips... some strange cider like flavor. 
Over all, the smells and tastes were not all that complex, but more specific from sip to sip. One thing I must mention is how well the alcohol was masked.
The mouthfeel was right on par, with good body, a slight syrupy oiliness, and a nice carbonated bite to balance it out.
Overall, a very nice brew. I will probalby try this again, but not too often at $7 a bottle. 1,023 characterszjungleist, Dec 29, 2005

The aroma is on candied rasins, fruit, and choclate. The flavor matches the aroma, except for the belgian sugar that is really sweet. The sickiness of the sugar leaves a slick feel in the mouth. After one the warm is enough and the sugary sweetness detracts from the ability to enjoy another. 409 charactersphishgator, Dec 28, 2005

thick, chewy malts with a brown sugary sweetness and hints of dark fruits. full, creamy mouthfeel with a little too much carbonation. alcohol taste is nonexistent, but the 11.3% hurts the drinkability. excellent beer. 572 charactersPrufrock, Dec 27, 2005

The ruby highlights glinting through the cloudy brown were beautiful. Smells sweet and fruity, with some chocolate in the mix too. Tastes mostly of sweet toffee and caramels, with raisins and plum and a small hint of the usual trappist breadiness thrown in for good measure. Feels creamy and well-carbonated, perfectly thick without being at all difficult to drink. Honestly extraordinary, the ABV is so well masked that the beer is warming and inviting and not at all harsh. 563 charactersMandrake, Dec 26, 2005

Smell is of dark fruit and deeply roasted grain, not an overpowering smell, just a very complex one that has subtle aromas to it. Taste has cherries and some malty sweetness, nothing extreme, just very complex. Mouthfeel is glorious and drinkability is high, to hell with the price. 463 charactersbadbeer, Dec 25, 2005

I must say, this week has been crucial. After a long string of disappointing brews, Ive had some great stuff this week - thank the good lord.
A: Dark black with a thick white head. Beautiful brew. Absolutely outstanding. 
S: Dark, maybe pumpernickel bread, plums, roasted malts, fire burnt molasses. 
T: Thick, juicy malts. A tad bit of caramel sweetness, but almost the perfect level. 
M: Thick, creamy, but not syrupy at all. Pretty much perfect here.
D: What? This has alcohol? Are you sure??? Cuz damn, I couldnt tell. I was so sad i spilled half of this, because I literally could drink it all night.
Lived up to its rep - one of the best beers in the world.

Pouring the beer reveals a creamy head,and a dark amber brown color. 11.3% abv, yet there is no real smell of alcohol. A beer that isn't bitterly hopped. Smooth drinking beer. You will find much yeast sediment at the bottom of your bottle or glass. The best beer I have ever tasted. 399 charactersmwcory, Dec 24, 2005

So for the coast off a Sierra Nevada pale ale six pack, I bought this to try- well because I wanted to. I feel that is enough justifcation. Anyway, I loved this beer. It was rather like an experience ot sorts. Huge creamy head above a dark amber liquid. Strong smell of dried figs, raisins- all kinds of sweetness. The smell of alcohol was also enormous. The beer started too cold to really get a take of it's flavor, so I let it sit for a while. It almost hard to describe how it tastes. It's jst so flavorful, with loads of carmel/ brown sugar sweetness balanced by almost a spicey note. It all works. It's a sipping beer, and really you can only have one. Alcohol is extremely high, but you can drink this beer easily over the course of an hour, so you don't get blasted right away. I will by this again, but only as a treat on a cold winter night. 966 charactersAaronRed, Dec 23, 2005

S - Figs, dates, a plethora of floral notes. It is almost offensive. Like spraying perfume up your nose. Definitely too fragrant, there are too many pleasant odors smashed together, not much is decernable. It is intensely sweet smelling.
T - Fruity, plums, dates and yellow raisins, accompany a bit of allspice and a potent sugar. The aftertaste is at first very sweet, I can see how others might like this, but I didn't. Then is is a slight bitter, but a bouquet of flavor continuously strikes long after you drink. It's neat at parts, but odd at others.
M - Thick, froths up in your mouth a lot. Fairly refreshing, but not in the sense that it washes things down. It leaves a residue.
D - For a quad, this is pretty drinkable. It still is a bit of a struggle to finish it. It is a good beer that many would like, a good beer that I won't soon buy again. 948 charactersmrasskicktastic, Dec 22, 2005
4.67/5  rDev +4.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5This beer pours a cloudy, murky brown, with an abundance of yeast settling in the glass. Smells complex and fruity, and the alcohol is very detectable here. There is an inital sweetness upon tasting, a malty, and honeylike uniqueness. It is thin with a slight coarseness (possibly due to the lingering yeast) and medium carbonation. Very nice balance of sweet and bitter, there are lots of hidden flavors in this one that are difficult to identify. Strong on alcohol, but like a Quadrupel should be. This is a fine example and I will have to drink a few more of these... 570 charactersbennetj17, Dec 21, 2005
4.72/5  rDev +5.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a thin, rapidly receding, white head over dark brown body. Intoxicating aromas of sweet vinous fruit and plums tinged with a strong medicinal alcohol presence. Soft up front with sweet malt and grape flavors. Very complex flavors that are difficult to pull apart and commend individually. There is a mild chocolate flavor, grapes, spiciness and the impossible to miss alcohol. A slight nip of spicy hops at the finish. Smooth and soft throughout with a clean, yet warming finish.
Unlike any beer Ive tasted before. Big alcohol presence carries a symphony of vinous flavor and aroma. Superb. 601 charactersShovelbum, Dec 21, 2005
4.94/5  rDev +10.5%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Other than appearance and drinkability, this beer is almost perfect. I still think that considering the strength of 11.3% abv, it is extremely drinkable. The aroma is sweet floral malt with the smell of barley, hay and some fruitiness like cherries or apples. Amazingly smooth pleasant mouthfeel. Taste is well balanced and smooth. All of the elements in the aroma are present on the palate. A beautifully crafted beer. 419 charactersrousee, Dec 20, 2005
3.83/5  rDev -14.3%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4man this stuff is pricey. i liked it though. definitely the better of the true trappiste/belgians. mmmm plums soaked in alcohol. don't get much better than that my friend...
appearance: nice and dark. awesome head. decent lacing. looks tasty.
smell: nice balance of oak, chocolate, and that all too familiar scent of plums and booze. yummy.
taste: c'mon don't make me say it again... although i will admit the alcohol taste wasn't as dominant once it warmed a bit in my hand. par for the course i suppose.
mouthfeel: full and well balanced. just the right amount of everything. carbonation felt nice on the tongue. got better as it warmed in the mouth.
drinkability: very nice. i was surprised at how i really wished i'd had another one on hand despite the alcohol content. 788 charactersbitterdestroyer, Dec 19, 2005
4.75/5  rDev +6.3%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5poured this from a 33cL bottle into a chalis
appearance: This beer pours a majestic dark brown with a nice finger thick, brown head. The lacing is excellent.
Smell: Chocolate syrup scent dominates with fruit and alcohol on the side. Smell is excellent; no scent dominates to an unpleasant degree.
Taste: Fruits hit first, followed by a dominant taste of roasted malts and slight hints of alcohol. 
Mouthfeel: Very smooth, perfect amount of carbonation. Your tongue will love you when you drink this.
Drinkability: Awesome drinkability for a high alcohol beer like this. You can hardly even taste the alcohol. I could drink this all night.
Notes: Simply an amazing beer. It isn't too sweet, not too bitter, perfectly complex. 742 characterspbr85, Dec 18, 2005
4.65/5  rDev +4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4murky brown with some ruby highlights, thick tan head that dissolves in a little while. leaves some lacing. i'm not gonna waste any time, cause this looks delicious.
the aroma is quite pungent vinous and sweet there is a lot of molasses, brown sugar and dark fruity aromas, plum, rainsin, black cherry stand out most. baked bready aromas fade in and out. there is some alcohol detectable. bananas and cocoa as it warms.
dark malty molasses and dark fruits abound here in the taste too, the plum raisin, and black cherry all present. there is a peppery spicy qulaity that may or may not be associated with the warming alcohol. pears and light chocolate flavors begin to appear with some warming as well as hints of vanilla and a generic candied fruit flavor. herbal hop bitterness coats the throat and is actually surprisingy present towards the finish. i'm liking the butterscotch that shows up at near room temp.
the body is smooth and creamy as hell with carbonation that at first feels stronger than it seems. very nice.
good drinkability for such a beefy beer. quite an experience, and something that should be sought out. i myself find that it's nice to come back to these beers once in a great while, if i had them too often, other stuff might not taste so good anymore. 1,280 characterskmo1030, Dec 15, 2005
4.53/5  rDev +1.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4This quad poured a dark brown color with a gradient form dark to light towards the bottom of the goblet. There was a fair ammount of sediment suspended in the body. A medium-sized head which left a small ammount of lacing on the glas.
The aroma was wonderful and only got better as it warmed. Molasses and raisin, a lot of malt, not much hops. Definitely some alcohol. The taste got MUCH better as it warmed; take home message is don't crack this one from the fridge. Pretty intense carbonation hits you at first, a bitter, acidic taste but it fades very quickly, leaving a complex taste of yeasts, malt, almost molasses, bready grain taste, alcohol, small hints of dark fruit. The mouthfeel was excellent, with a very unique smoothness that developed with tempterature. It was extremely full-bodied, with a subtle semi-sweet aftertaste that was excellent. This is one of the finest, if not the very best quad I hve ever tasted. Try it, you'll like it. 953 characterssinistrsam, Dec 13, 2005

I picked this up at Premier Gourmet, in Buffalo. Waited to have it back-to-back with the Rochefort 8.
A: Ruby-black, off white head. Head isn't as fluffy or retained nearly as well as the 8, but it does leave a nicer lace.
S: Chocolatey, raisins, molases and alcohol! Not as fruity as the 8, but a little maltier.
T: More sherry-like than it's little brothers, but more chocolatey than the 8, with a lot more molases as well. Lots of roasted malt and caramel flavour. Alcohol taste is very apparant, and becomes overtly assertive as it warms.
M: Moderate body (lighter than some quads), fairly high carbonation.
D: It's good, but the alcohol taste and subsequent inebriation is rather limiting.
Personally, I enjoy Rocheforts 'light' weights a little more. In terms of other quads, it's a little more potent, with a slightly lighter body than most. 910 charactersDerek, Dec 11, 2005
4.9/5  rDev +9.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5I am enjoying this beer in a 33 cL Ommegang holiday chalice. The beer is slightly chilled and should warm throughout the review. The bottle has been in my cellar for approximately one year (a 2004 christmas gift via Liquid Solutions).
Appearance: Dark brown, almost opaque. When held to light, a slight rub red appears. Nice Brussels lace appears around the lip of the chalice, as a result of a few anticipatory sips.
Smell: Nothing else on earth smells like this. Dark fruity overtones jump out, even when the beer is fresh from the fridge. The high alcohol content is masked incredibly by the wonderful aroma of the ale.
Taste: This is my first '5' rating for taste. The beer warms nicely on the tongue, releasing some very pleasant tastes in the mouth. The sugars used are readily apparent, as taste is sweet without being too sweet, strong without being too strong. This beer is a tricky one. The high alcohol content is not readily noticeable, but it is there and can knock you off your feet.
Mouthfeel: This ale sits so nicely on the palate that one does not want to swallow it. Allow it to sit for 5-10 seconds on your tongue. As it warms, it takes on a whole new personality. Incidentally, I have had this beer at room temperature (not 55 degrees, but room temp of say 70 degrees) and it is great at that temperature.
Drinkability: This beer is so close to perfection (how appropriate then that it is brewed by a Trappist monastery). The drinkability falls just short as it is so delicious that more than 2-3 bottles is too much (not to mention to 11.3% abv). 
There is no beer I'd rather drink than Rochefort 10. It is my favorite ale, hands down, and always on stock in my cellar. 1,708 charactersakorsak, Dec 10, 2005
4.82/5  rDev +7.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5This beer pours a light cola brown that was very murky with a few clumps of yeast swimming around the bottom. It also had a tan and copper head that is creamy smooth with only a few large bubbles sticking together in clumps. As the beer sat, the head got creamier and smoother. The head stuck around until the end with a film of mini bubbles that looked like a sheet of tiny ball bearings. When I finished the last of the beer, there was still a spot of head in the bottom of the glass. Nice. 
The beer smelled of maple syrup, molasses and black liquorish. There was also a yeasty smell of pepper and spearmint. I found it amazing was that there was zero alcohol smell, even at 11.3%. 
The flavor was magnificent. It tasted of smooth and creamy brown sugar and marshmallows with a dry coffee and liquorish finish that stuck to the roof of my mouth. There was also a pleasant warming in the finish. The flavor possessed a certain quality that I can only liken to jazz. It wasnt how many notes that were played, but the quality of the notes. Fantastic! Also, there wasnt a hint of booze in the flavor beside the warming, but my stomach warmed up none the less. Very nice. 
The mouth feel was thin that let the flavors glide together with an un-obtrusive carbonation. 
Well done! 1,292 charactersDarkerTheBetter, Dec 06, 2005
4.8/5  rDev +7.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 511.2 oz. brown glass bottle. Enjoyed on a day when the windchill outside is near -20F.
Appearance: A ton of tan head instantly forms when poured into my schell tulip. Body is a rich burgundy with ample visible carbonation.
Smell: Rich dark fruit, musty wood, alcohol, sharp, and fairly sweet smelling. Lots of malt in this one.
Taste: Strong and sweet, very vinous and warming. Alcohol is very upfront and sharp, nice belgian yeast funk, grapes, dates, plums, and a hop and alcohol finsh that is long lasting and sharp.
Mouthfeel: I don't know how you could find a fault with this beer, let alone the mouthfeel, damn good. This beeer could be laid down for years and have a whole new experience to offer. A wonderful Trappist ale. 742 charactersTastyTaste, Dec 06, 2005

The smell is deep and full of dark fruits. Dark malts dominate the front of the taste, and are taken over by fruits and eventually hops. The mouthfeel is solid but incredibly smooth and creamy. Drinkability is very good.
Fantastic stuff here. 387 characterswatermelonman, Nov 27, 2005
4.88/5  rDev +9.2%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5The bottle has no date on it, but hell I dont care with a beer this big. Poured from the bottle into a 20 ounce wine gobblet.
Appearance: This beer pours a dark brown. The head is kind of thin. Maybe I poured this beer badly? The head was maybe a fingers width foamy white. There are floating solids in the beer. The lacing was thick and lusty as I drank the beer.
Smell: Gods this is heavenly. There is some malty fruityness upon first smell. There is some nice spicyness playing with the nose. Maybe it is cloves and chocolate?
Taste: This is a treat from all the Beer Gods. The malty sweetness is combined with a wonderfully balanced spicy fruity chocolate taste. 
Mouthfeel: This beer is very full bodied. The gentle carbonation helps this big beer slide down the throat. Did I mention bliss.
Drinkability: This is a very big beer. With that said, this beer is wonderful. The huge alcohol content 11.3% does not dominate. It instead plays with the team of sugars, spices and general goodness. 1,011 charactersnlmartin, Nov 22, 2005
4.76/5  rDev +6.5%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This beer pours out of an eleven and a half brown bottle to be a dark opaque brown color. It forms a rich creamy looking head. Not only is the head thick but it sticks to the sides of the glass as well, providing a good amount of lacing. This beer is absoutely one of the best looking beers I have drank thus far. It also has good head retention, there is always a head on the beer that doesn't, over time, fade into nothingness. 
The smell of this beer is really quite weak. I smell a faint aroma that quickly fades and eludes me. Although I really can't smell a strong aroma with this beer, what I do detect smells great.
This beer tastes great. It has a very complex taste. Can't really describe the specific tastes of this beer, I don't think that my palate is that in tune yet, but I can say that it is a good brew. The first aspect of this beer I taste is its malt character. This is then followed by a bitter taste on the back of the tongue which in turn is followed by more of a malt flavor. The after taste of this beer leaves my mouth feeling kinda dry. I can definitely taste the alcohol in this one, however it blends well ( in my opinion ) with the flavor of the beer. I also taste a roasted malt influence in this beer.
This beer feels great on the palate. It has a full body, and is moderately heavy on the palate. The level of carbonation in this beer complements the flavor of the beer. Overall this beer is great. If you haven't tried it find yourself a bottle and get some. I think that this bottle was worth the five dollars I paid for it and I would definitely buy it again. 1,604 charactersbecktone, Nov 22, 2005
4.9/5  rDev +9.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5A dark and beautiful appearance. A clear dark amber to brown in color.
The smell is similar to a mild whiskey aroma bolsterd by very mild, fruity tones, but the mildness ends when it touches your lips. The taste begins with a smooth malty character that drops out of the bottom of your mouth. The alcohol comes through in high, breezy tones with the air of a good liquor. This beer warms me from head to toe after the first three sips, which feels like one whole beer.
This is one of the cleanest beers I've ever had. It puts it all together in one imported bottle. This is one massive beer that will make you spilly inside of one bottle.

4.35/5  rDev -2.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Appearance: Pours out dark brown, almost purple-ish. Generous head gave way to a thin layer of bubbles 
Smell: Generous bouquet of sweet caramel malts and candy sugar under a blanket of dark fruit (particularly raisins). Some sweet, juicy nectarines. A dash of spicy yeastiness. A touch of leather. All of it smelling quite "Belgian". Note: the high alcohol is surprisingly subdued in the aroma.
Taste: A well blended, outstanding example of a quadruppel. This beer features brown sugar, black cherries, anise, raisins, and toasted toffee malts. There's a great depth of varying flavors, so pay attention, but don't forget to savor. All of this gives way to a long-lived spicy, white pepper finish.
Mouthfeel: Strikingly smooth, very rich, and with a low, gentle amount of carbonation.
Drinkability: A+++ Power Beer. Would buy from again! As good as folks say, perhaps better. Especially for me, someone who's not overly partial to the style.
(Edit: After trying several beers within this style during a blind tasting on May 21st, 2007, Rochefort 10 was the unanimous, clear-cut winner.) 1,092 charactersChainGangGuy, Nov 18, 2005

Thick and viscous, not much light escapes. Poured very carefully, and still managed a substantial head, and it certainly has no intention of leaving.
Incredibly complex aroma, there's no way I'm going to be able to do this beer justice with words. There's a boozy sweetness in the forefront, with notes of chocolate and mild tobacco. Remarkably balanced.
Mouthfeel is as creamy and rich as.. well, not much is gonna match up to this. It's delectible.
The taste is the epitome of smoothness. Flavors are all over the place, but the alcohol remains elusive. It's there, but it's masked superbly. I'm sensing a mingling of chocolate, bitter orange peel, rum, maybe bananas. My tastebuds are reeling, trying to process all this. And all the while it's the smoothest damn thing you've ever drank.

Smell: Rich and complex. Bananas, vanilla, dried fruits and alcohol.
Taste: Follows the nose. Reminds me of 'Nilla wafers and banana pudding, but with a ton of alcohol! This is so complex I don't even know how to describe it. Dried fruits and alcohol come in big-time at the end, but the overall taste is dominated by the banana sweet-bread flavors.
Mouthfeel: Somewhat dry, but relatively light for they style. Nicely carbonated.
Drinkability: This one's a sipper. I could drink it faster, but it's so rich and complex that I want to savor it slowly. The high ABV and cost of the brew would be the only things keeping me from a second bottle.
Got a great deal on this bottle since a rep was in the store giving out samples, but even if it was full price it would have been worth it. Incredibly complex brew with some fantastic unique flavors. Find it and buy it. Now. 977 charactersjamesdergen, Nov 06, 2005

Pours a deep dark brown with a healthy bubbly tan head that falls to a ring around the glass. Very nice. Aromas of deep dark fruity caramel, molasses, raisins, licorice with a wonderful depth of spicy yeastiness. Exquisetly exotic and beautiful. Brown sugar with mellow butterscotch tones. Wow, earthy yeast is bountiful, amazing...simply amazing and hard to even put into words. I can't stop smelling this one. Incredible.
First sip brings a spicy, caramelly dark maltiness. Molasses, brown sugar, dark fruits, incredibly complex. Earthy, spicy yeast tones explode everywhere. Hints of cherry with subtle notes of alcohol that reminds you it's still there. An amazing beer that has more depth than nearly any other beer I have yet to try. Wow. Simply awe-inspiring, leaving me nearly speechless. If there was a 5.5 for taste this beer would definetly qualify.
Smooth, mellow mouthfeel with fast moving carbonation. Goes down easily and attacks each and every taste bud in the mouth. Not to seem too gluttonous...but I could easily have a few of these in one sitting. Simply an amazing beer that left me wondering why I hadn't tried it sooner. One of a kind, amazing, a beautiful creation. Alcohol is incredibly well hidden. If you have yet to try this...go and do it now...you will not be disappointed. I will be picking some more up for myself ASAP. 1,423 charactersorbitalr0x, Oct 31, 2005

The smell is thick and deep and spicy, with some notes of fresh orange and black licorice.
The flavour has some of that licorice, but also a nice slightly over-caramelized brown-sugary overtone, with some fruit and spice on the finish. Very nice. There's just a hint of alcohol on the end.
The carbonation is high on the tongue, and rather assertive- though not unpleasantly so. Liquid is just a touch oily, and slightly thicker than you'd expect.
The drinkability score say it all, so I won't. :)

uncap the bottle with a lively psst! poured carefully to leave behind most of the sediment.
appearance is a very murky dark purple/brown. medium-high carbonation. specs of yeast sediment floating around on turbulent updrafts caused by the tiny rising bubbles. stable 1cm thick tan head with a dark brown patch where the last few mls were poured through.
strong sweet aroma. slight alcohol on the nose, but mostly dark fruits makinf for a mouth watering and intoxicating mix. im guessing text book quad.
seriously full taste. bombards the mouth with dark chocolate, sweet fruits, and some alcohol heat. to put it plainly, light macro lager is on one end of the "flavor" spectrum, and this on the other.

3.17/5  rDev -29.1%look: 3 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 2.5 |  overall: 2.5Tiny 11.2oz bottle. 11.3% ABV. $5.49 with my original review in 2005, and $7.49 on my re-review 8/13/2010.
Pours out to a very vile and murky looking stew...dark mahogany with globs of yeast swimming around. Forms a modest light tan head with good retention and no lacing at all. Not an appealing looking beer to say the least. Carbonation is strong, with a firm "whoosht" when releasing the cap. Requires a delicate pour to avoid a glassful of foam and yeasty beasties. Very briskly carbonated. The aroma is of cola, Belgian candi syrup, cloves, carob, caramel, vanilla, alcohol, light molasses, very faint banana, distant cocoa powder. Mouthfeel is sickly sweet, cola-like, and syrupy with a touch of fusels...very cloying with a medium body. Warming. Definitely oxidized, with a ruddy finish. Hrmmm...the taste. Really, this tastes like someone poured some chocolate syrup into flat concentrated Coke syrup. Bitterness is mild. I have a hard time detecting much in the way of smaller details as everything is overwhelmed by the cola...maybe cereal like sweetness with cocoa and molasses. I can finish the bottle, but I don't really want to.
A gross, one-dimensional syrupy mess of a beer. I've had this 2 or 3 times, thinking maybe my taste buds were off or I got a bad bottle, and I remain very unimpressed. For the same cost, I can get a 750ml bottle of Unibroue Trois Pistoles or a 220z'er of Avery Reverend, both of which are vastly superior products and infinitely more enjoyable. 1,490 charactersMitchster, Oct 27, 2005

I stopped at a beer store and picked up a Rochefort 8 and 10. Glad to see this one around Richmond again. 330ml. $5.99 a pop.
A: Poured into my Het Kapittel goblet, the TR10 offers up some seriously thick and creamy off-white head. It boils up initally and settles down to a finger-thick layer. Patchwork quilt of sticky lace sits on the sides of the glass. Color is a murky deep brown color with hints of red near the edges. Just a gorgeous appearance.
S: Dark fruit notes leap into the nostrils. Lots of sugar, caramel. There's also a powdered cocoa (Nestle Quik?) aroma. Wisps of bannana esters filter through. Hints of a strongly medicinal alcohol noted as well. 
T: Fruits enter first to dance on the palate. Buckets of thick and syrupy carmelized sugar rain down. Raisins, plums dipped in cocoa powder appear. Bit of chalky character creeps in. Bitterness dropped in a shot glass of alcohol ends this wonderful ride. Overall, the ABV is well-hidden. A little kick in the belly is all that you notice. 
M: Much thinner than expected. Not a creamy thick beer at all. I certainly expected something larger in size.
D: Very easy to drink. Complex, but in a well-balanced way. Nothing unsettling or unpleasant anywhere to be found. LOTS of flavor. Seriously good beer. 1,401 charactersOldFrothingSlosh, Oct 23, 2005

Smell is wonderful. First whiff is sweet with raisins and alcohol. Malty and fruity. Lots of molasses notes and dried fig, apricot, cherry. 
Mouthfeel is great. Very smooth and full-bodied. Coats the palate like a champ. Slightly bubbly, but not harsh. Just the right amount of alcohol burn down the throat. Warm in the tummy!
Taste is out of this world. Nutty, fruity, malty, sugary. The figs are present with brown sugar and almonds. Some cinnamon, but very slight.

3.8/5  rDev -15%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3 |  overall: 3.5Well, after a less-than-stellar blind tasting performance this past summer at a friend's house, I've finally decided to have another Rochefort 10 -- this time for the "official" rating.
Served at cellar temperature from the standard 33cl bottle with a drink before date of 06-10-2009. Poured into a beautiful Rochefort Goblet at cellar temperature along with all sediment.
A - Pours a dark chestnut brown color with many visible flecks of off-white sediment in suspension like glitter you may find in a gel candle. The head is modest, medium tan in color, and reduces to a tiny-bubbled surface film within a minute or two. Lacing is good, but nothing extraordinary.
S - During the pour, I got an ancillary whiff of sweet port wine. However, when I put my nose to the glass, out pops the rum-soaked raisins and dark, heavy date-nut bread. Candy sugar and molasses notes are also easy to pick out. Light banana esthers are noticeable, but hidden in the background as are herbal vinous notes. Very complex and interesting.
T - Pungent, dark fruits wash into the mouth on a cordial-like alcohol wave. Raisins, figs, dates -- they're all here in a candied form that grows in the middle. The finish brings out the only real taste of caramel maltiness, accompanied by a strong and drying, but controlled hoppiness. The aftertaste is all molasses and alcohol, paired with a burning afterglow in the belly. There certainly is a lot going on in this beer!
M - Vigorous carbonation makes each sip foamy and mouthfilling to a slight detriment. After a few sips, the tip of the tongue begins to go numb from a potent mix of alcohol and carbonation, also to its detriment since it hinders enjoyment of the taste. Average mouthfeel overall, for a quad.
D - As I originally thought during my summertime tasting, this beer is not my favorite quad by a longshot. Its tastes are all huge, but for a sipping beer, there could be better balance. Don't get me wrong the beer is quite good, but there is no real evidence of the subtlety that makes a good beer great. 2,061 charactersEPseja, Oct 21, 2005

A - Pours out an opaque brown color with a large off white head. Lots of lacing from the beginning.
S - Lots of alcohol with some fruits. 
T - Dark breads with some fruity tastes in there. Excellent. The alcohol is masked completely.
M - Nicely carbonated and extremely smooth.
D - Goes down like a beer with half the alcohol. Very easy to drink.
Notes: Well I am now officially a Rochefort fan. Duvel was always my favorite Belgian but I think the Rocehfort 10 and 8 which I tried a few nights ago both take the top spot. 586 charactersEStreet20, Oct 20, 2005
3.65/5  rDev -18.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5Pours a deep brown color with ruby highlights. Large, tan colored head sits atop the liquid. Its fairly clear, and looks quite enticing in a Belgian chalice. The aroma is full of malt, alcohol and phenols. The smell is a little harsh. I expected a more sublimely blended and dovetailed aroma. Its a very satisfying and full smell, but its sort of rough-hewn. Peppery and earthy. The taste is sweet, with considerable malt. Its got yeasty, estery, fruity flavors as well. Alcohol warming is notable. All the flavors are quite intense. This is a very satisfying, enjoyable, intense brew. Unfortunately, in my opinion, it doesnt quite stand up to its reputation. 669 charactersSuds, Oct 16, 2005
4.6/5  rDev +2.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4$6.99 @ buy rite edison nj (this thing was $15 @ a place in soho a couple of weeks ago.. and almost worth that price imo!), 04 03 09 stamped on the bottle, play the lotto with the numbers or something...
eyes...
dark ruby eyes stare out from this monster trappist, the head holds fast at one finger of perfectly formed clone bubbles, the lace sticks like the pages of an old porno mag, the only light penetrating this bad boy is at the bottom of the glass where the glass is thinner, in the middle, nada luz baby. it sits there and just says "go ahead fucker".. beautiful, you could take 100 photos and they would all be this stoic beer sitting there staring at you.. it's like mt rushmore...
nose...
raisin spirits, distilled grapes, this smells more like wine than beer imo, almost like a slightly chocolate cabernet.. lovely. The alcohol isnt hiding either. as it warms more to room temp the choc is a little more prevalent, dark chocolate, perhaps chocolate covered dark cherries would be in order.. this is one to savor.. some smokehouse almonds would rule with this... 
taste etc...
lighter than it looks in body but the flavor is powerfull. definitely a sipper to get in all that is happening here, "dry non sweet chocolate dark fruit" is the best way I can describe it... tones of raisin fade off with the carbonation that has a nice prickly sensation on the pallete, delicious. the alcohol has a nice warming effect and is very present. Considering the ABV this is very drinkable, and would be a fantastic digestif with cheese after a nice winter meal in front of the fireplace.
verdict?
it aint rated this highly for nothing.. this is no poser, and honestly it is a little different than other easy to get belgians (at least around these parts). Worth it. Get it. Drink it. 1,799 charactersEgo, Oct 09, 2005
4.92/5  rDev +10.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Appearance: This beer pours a deep amber red/brown. The head is very thin but has staying power (note I used a Watou chalice). Lacing is very sticky for this particular beer.
Smell: Terrific sweet smell of plums and sugar with hints of copper. Very pleasant.
Taste: This is an outstanding beer! The alcohol is definitely present and noticeable, but considering the strength of this beer, not overpowering. Taste hints a bit at sugar and spices. Pallate is a bit chocolately even. Rolls over the tongue with bubbles and finishes with the taste of the alcohol and gently fades into chocolate. Leaves a very warm, almost numb feeling at the back of the pallate. Wonderful!
This is a beer that you feel almost immediately, but in a warm, subtle way. One is definitely manageable. May want to rethink a second however depending on tolerance and if you have any plans after you start drinking!
Truly a wonderful beer! Perhaps even a new favorite!? 953 charactersstof0048, Oct 05, 2005
4.03/5  rDev -9.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4A fizzy soda pop sound as I pop the cap.
Appearance: A deep amber chocolate body with a very tight foamy tan head. A weird brown yeasty circle forms in the middle of the head. Looks like the monks sprinkled some cinnamon on top of my beer. Head retention on this is incredible...as I would expect.
Smell: Figs, plums, date bread...all things dark, sweet, and fruity.
Taste: A strong alcohol base with figs, grapes, rum soaked raisins, toffee, and carmel. Maybe some butterscotch. It has some characteristics of a very robust cabarnet in terms of the heaviness of the beer. The alcohol is pretty prominent but seems to mellow through the session. Kind of cool how it changes in character.
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied and smooth. A definite numbing on the tongue and palate after each sip.
Drinkability: One to be appreciated. The alcohol is a little too prominent for my likes. It does mellow which is cool. Glad I tried it, strongly recommended, but for the price I probably won't be back anytime soon. 1,014 charactersmattcrill, Oct 02, 2005
4.8/5  rDev +7.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5I hate to give anything a perfect score (I believe that everything can be inproved because God or goddess, whatever you believe in, is the only perfect creator). I gave this one the closest score to perfect as I could because I find it hard to figure out how to improve it (and the monks have devine intervention, being that they are close to God). I wish that I could give 4.9's instead of 4.5's.
With that, let's go on to the review:
A: a wonderful amber to brown in color. A nice head when poured that quickly went to a thin layer above the top of the liquid. 
S: a bit of sweetness entered my nose with light undertones of hops. Seems kinda mild for a 11.3 beer, but is very pleasing. No alcohol smell.
T: OMG! Way too smooth to be a 11.3% abv. If I hadn't read the label, I'd have a hard time believing that it was that high octane. No medicine type taste due to the alcohol, I assume due to Belgian candy sugar. Lightly hoppy and very smooth (did I say that already?).
M: The one word that keeps coming to mind is smooth (and WOW), but it describes the mouthfeel as well as any word that I can eminate. The candy sugar must be hiding the alcohol, because it's not coming out in the mouthfeel or the taste.
D: Sweet and fruity, but quite balanced without too much of anything and without too little of anything. I like this beer so much that we brewed 10 gallons to try to emulate it (it should be ready in about 4 weeks). I just hope that we can get anywhere close to where these monks have taken us.
By the way, did I say this beer was smooth? 1,571 charactersSSGPat, Oct 02, 2005

I always find it hard to begin drinking big beers like this--it's a challenge and I fear I'll be found wanting. Oh well, judgement time. It smells spicy, with prominent licorice, prunes, and raisins. The flavor is similar to the nose, with a little hoppiness and a bit of a medicinal quality. Big, thick mouthfeel. I like the 8 better, but as Quadrupels go, this is better than the Allagash Four I had recently. 555 charactersbattlekow, Sep 30, 2005
4.3/5  rDev -3.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4My first actual review - tired of lurking. I picked up a bottle at Hy-Vee's Wine & Spirits store in Cedar Falls. I'm impressed with their expanded selection, but the freshness of off-brands is sometimes suspect. Anyway, I bought this on a lark. I wanted to try a trappist ale but didnt know one from the other. So I grabbed the last Rochefort 10 on the shelf. My theory was that the good ones sell fastest (okay  thats stupid, but I was in a hurry).
A: I gave this bottle a gentle pour into the closest appropriate glassware I could find, a heavy glass chalice emblazon with the word Michelob on its side (doh!). For the sake of respect of Trappist Ales of any type, I turned the label on the glass so it could not gaze upon the bottle. As I poured, it foamed up right away without effort and the light brown colored head remained for almost the entire time it remained in the glass. Not overly carbonated  excellent retention.
S: Nothing incredible regarding smell. There was a good release of a sweet hoppy smell when the bottle was opened, but that was all. In the glass, things were pretty reserved. Some sweetness to the nose, but very mild overall.
T: Okay, this is what moved me into actually making a review. This was different than almost any beer that Id had up to this point. The flavor was very bold and pronounced, yet absolutely smooth. Not overly sweet, no rough edges, no strong hop bitterness. It was like one of those huge dogs that loves kids: The capability to bite my head off but no desire to do so, it just wanted to cuddle up to me. One major minus to note was that the high ABV was very evident in the aftertaste. Probably the only negative thing Ill say, but it does stand out. Perhaps the Rochefort 8 is more my style?
M: A real good mouthfeel. Heavy but smooth. Very well done. As you take a sip, your lips constantly cut through a thin, smooth layer of tight foam that adds to the experience.
D: Are you kidding? I may have to ask the store manager if financing is available, but I will definitely be having this again. Like almost everyone has stated: This is a must try beer if you get the chance.
EDIT: Next time I'll be brief - the ABV must have gotten to me. 2,226 charactersTodler, Sep 30, 2005
4.95/5  rDev +10.7%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Undoubtedly one of the best beers ever made. Such complexity, flavor, boldness, and so much togetherness; this beer ranks right there with the Westvleterns and St. Bernardus Abt. 12's of the world.
The murky brown liquid pours into the brandy snifter with a turbulant and froathy pour. An airy, lightly tanned head shows sprinkles of yeast and spices. The beer settles with a half-inch head and laced well as the beer magically disappeared. Despite the rusty and sediment rich pour, the beer has a nice appearance.
Cotton candy sweetness hits the nose with a lot of fruitiness, spiciness, and with a chocolatey, vineous hint that keeps my head spinning. The nose promises complexity immediately.
Malty richness of barley sugars, caramels, and toffee set the tone. Quickly a toasty, chocolatey flavor accompanies the malts and a rich concoction of sweetness begins to emerge. Fruitiness of berries, grapes, dates, figs, plumbs, and apples quickly give a balance and needed variety to the sweet malt taste. A light hint of barrel aged woods make a minor impact later with mild tang and mustiness on the mouth. A confectionate and complex reward to the tongue.
Initial powder-sugar textures develop quickly into a well-malted, well-rounded beverage. Full and suculant textures allow the acidic fruit notes and light hop bitterness to settle the beer and calm the sweetness. Finishes with a dry, well-attenuated, airy finish. For such sweetness, the beer leaves very little residual sweetness on the mouth.
Certainly a desert beer, but not one that relies soley on sweetness. The beer continues to develop with each successive sip and as the beer warms. Remarkably easy to drink seeing how malt dominant the beer shows. A magical beer that defies modern brewing logic. 1,769 charactersBEERchitect, Sep 29, 2005

Aroma of raisins, prunes, and sweet apples. The flavor is definitely complex - the different flavors this went through as it warmed was pretty impressive. It seemed every time I took a sip, I tasted a new flavor. Spicy / peppery / yeasty flavor was present throughout. Absolutely no alcohol harshness - I was amazed to see this beer was 11.3 ABV - just a nice warming effect A must try. 469 charactersBlastTyrant, Sep 24, 2005
4.62/5  rDev +3.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.5This beer pours a dark brown. Pour it gently. The past 2 bottles I have had foamed up very quickly when poured (both settled and at the right temp.). The head leaves moderately heavy lacing on the glass.
The smell has hints of fruit flavors. The taste confirms this with plums and figs coming to mind. There are layers of complex flavors to this beer, and a nice balance with the malt and hops. Overall an incredible tasting beer.
The mouthfeel is smooth as can be with a little alcohol coming through.
Drinkability is lowered by ABV, and the fact that you will go broke if you try to session this stuff.
Everyone should try this beer if they get a chance. Outstanding. 681 charactersgotbeer, Sep 20, 2005

Is this beer or a connection? The heady aromas of kirschwasser and chocolate creme and stone corridors aren't enough to alert the rest of the senses to the experience of tense honey and herbs. It reminds me of sharing warm times with friends, of rainy winter days wrapped in a comforter with my beloved. Beyond beer it seems. 564 charactersinebrius, Sep 14, 2005

The beer pours a rich chocolate brown with some chestnut on the edges. A soft fluffy beige head foams up 3 cm easily. Aroma is chocolate and molasses with some dark fruit, plums and raisins. the head leaves some tight lattice as it fades.
First sip reveals a smooth silky body and mild carbonation that is almost non-existant. Flavor is sweet from start with toffee, brown sugar, raisins, and red grape these all mix nicely. There is a bit of peppery hot alcohol on the finish that makes the beer a bit of a sipper. A nice rich beer, just dont try to drink it too fast! 628 characterssulldaddy, Sep 09, 2005

Smell: Nice sweet candi, alcohol, herbs, dark fruit, and... theres something rather luxurious about the aroma. And theres a unique scent in there I cant quite put my finger on. Almost like sandalwood? In any case its marvelous
Taste: Alcohol and sturdy malts are present as soon as it touches the tip of the tongue, followed by fruit, clove and a cookie-like sweetness thats marvelous. The sweetness sticks around for quite a while before letting a very light floral bitterness take over in medium-long finish.
Mouthfeel: So wonderful, near perfection. A chewy, full body with not too much carbonation.
Drinkability: I made the mistake of taking this one out of the fridge and having some of it a few minutes after, and of course I wasnt too impressed. It was too cold and all of the characteristics were muted with the exception of an herbal, alcoholic harshness. When I realized what was wrong, I set it aside for a little while and let it warm up a bit, and it was practically a different beer. I then understood why this beer is rated so highly. Sure, its pricey, but you get what you pay for. And its a small price to pay for an occasional luxurious treat like this. 1,337 charactersski271, Sep 06, 2005
4.79/5  rDev +7.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.533cl bottle purchased at Jim's Homebrew in Spokane for $7.29 (those wacky Jim's prices...). Freshness date on bottle, but it is obscured due to the fact that the rear label was placed on the bottle in a fashion so that it overlaps the main, "front" label. 
Pours a very dark brown color, with a light brown shade showing at the edges when held up to the light. Moderate, light tan head & moderate lace.
Smells very tasty indeed once it warms up a little. Dark fruit, candy sugar, molasses, and alcohol all make their presence felt. When a beer smells like this, you just know it's going to taste fantastic!
This is the tastiest beer I've had in a long time. The prune-like dark fruit flavor strikes home pretty much the same time as the candy sugar sweetness is detected, creating an excellent balance that sees neither sweet nor bitter from spinning out of control. There's also subtle peppery notes lending a subdued spiciness to the proceedings. The warming alcohol is very noticeable, as one would expect from a beer of this strength, but it's not overbearing. God, what a tasty beer!
This isn't as thick a beer as it's amount of flavor would indicate, but I would still call it a full bodied beer. Carbonation was spot on. 
A fantastic sipper, I enjoyed this after a particularly long workday. While this is eminently drinkable, you'd be nuts (and well-off, financially) to session-drink this one. The abv would definitely kick your ass. Still, it's an excellet after dinner beer, or a treat after a long, trying day. 1,537 characterswoemad, Sep 05, 2005

Entry is sharp with prickly carbonation and a multi-layered, full mouthfeel. Midtaste begins with plum, dark cherries, and earthy malts imparting a biscuity feel. The finish spikes with slightly acidic dried fruits and closes with a beautiful yeast fade. The throat practically glows from the 11.3% ABV.
Simply wonderful and worthy of being ranked among the top five beers in the world! 559 charactersIceAce, Aug 27, 2005

Probalby bacuase the best before date is in 2009. Fairly sweet with some of the dark fruit character. I think its pretty thin and there is quite a bit of burn. It hangs around a bit and kind of stings the back or my throat. I think Ill go get a couple more bottles and re rate later.

The aroma on this one is a little more mellow in comparison to the 6 and 8 but it is still very good. It like the 6 and 8 have a lot of dark fruit aroma only this one is a little more subtle.
The taste is also of dark fruits like figs and raisins and also of molasses. There is definately some alcohol presence in this beer as well. Very nice.
The mouthfeel is full bodied with medium/moderate carbonation.

The aroma took me off guard a little bit, I expected the nose to have some alcohol to the nose, I mean it is 11.3%, but man I got the first wiff of sweet candy sugars but then the alcohol burned its way in to my nostrils. The sweetness hits my tongue like Ike Turner. I can detect raisins and what seems like brown sugar and caramel battling it out too, but the alcohol quickly soothes all of the activity. This puppy coats your mouth wonderfully. The flavors really pick up as this dude warms, I am glad that I am taking my time with this one. The alcohol makes drinkability an issue but overall I am happy with my first Rochefort experience. 763 charactersBigHead, Aug 27, 2005

Dark brown pour with slight tan head. Many slightly hidden aromas from this one, with lots of sweet malt and maybe a little coffee, many types of prune-fig like fruit, and some alchohol. One of the nicer, lesser pronounced smelling beers I've had in a while.
Superb layering of flavors, which lends to why this beer always ranks so well - there's something here for everyone, and not much that will drive folks away. Chocolates, toffee, sweet caramel/almost butterscotch...winey like flavors appear as beer warms, and really begins to take on a whole second life. Yummy!
At between six and eight dollars a bottle, I won't be drinking this all that often, but I look forward to enjoying maybe 6 a year. 804 characterslostbearbrew, Aug 25, 2005

Looks deep deep dark brown, with a light tan head, no light getting through this. Smell is raisiny, light, sweet. Not as deep as I wanted it to be.
Taste is... not bad. But not living up to the hype. Raisiny, sweet, pruney. Alcohol is extremely well hidden. Mouthfeel is bubbly, medium-bodied, feels good. Pretty drinkable, but overall too sweet to be extremely drinkable. I liked this better when it warmed up, but overall I was disappointed. Perhaps I got a young bottle- who knows. Still, a good beer, and very sneaky at 11 percent. 648 charactersscooter231, Aug 20, 2005

Complex, warm aroma with lots of malt (caramel and toffee), a deep fruitiness, and vinous alcohol, but it still stays fairly soft and mellow. Wonderful flavours as well, with the caramel and toffee maltiness joined by a light roasted character. Ripe fruit as well as a bit of chocolate (mainly as it warms) and sugary sweetness. Finishes with plenty of alcohol warmth. Full body and high carbonation to start, but this reduces quickly. Airy texture with a drying and slightly grainy texture. This is fast becoming my favourite line of trappist beers. Excellent complexity and balance, big flavours yet still remains mellow. A joy to enjoy. 761 charactersDrJay, Aug 20, 2005

Strong carmelized sugars, sweet rum and raisins in the aroma. Resembles a tawny port. This aroma starts nice after the pour, but as the brew warms, aromas come together especially well.
Amazing dose of flavors, including raisins, molasses and a little sour fruit. A nice hint of finishing hops scrubs everything up for the next sip. A moderate hit of alcohol slammed me at the end of each drink. Some might find a bit overwhelming, but I enjoyed it and didn't find it out of whack. Hard to complain about a quadrupel noting some alcohol.
Mouthfeel is perfect, coats the entire palate with fruity flavor, only to rapidly fade away. This perfection makes it difficult to not drink too fast. 864 characterslongarm, Aug 18, 2005

Pours very black, with almost a purpish tinge. Color of liquid toffee. Slight head with some heavy carbonation. But that carbonation receded upon sipping to feel heavy and soothing on the palate. Extremely full and broad feel to this flavor. Whole lot of things happening in the flavor. Very candy like--toffee, caramel, chocolate, and mounds of Belgian sugars. Yeast is very prevalent too and provides a very nice plum flavor. Aroma is more of the plums. Alcohol is also quite strong but does nto detract from the drinkability because this beer is so full of flavor. 656 charactersMuddyFeet, Aug 07, 2005

One of my favorite things about this beer is its lively, active carbonation. It's very unique to have a beer of this strength to have the champagne-like carbonation of a hefe-weizen. It leads to awesome head retention and amazing drinkability.

Served in a Watou oversize wine glass, with the utmost respect. Drink by date reads 04 03 09.
Appearance- Pours a deep chestnut brown with a fantastic, thick head that lingers for more than five minutes. Lacing is superb, excellent cling. The bubbles are the smallest I have ever seen floating atop a beer, with amazing structure. This looks heavy, like it weighs more than 11 oz.
Smell- Figs, leather, alcohol, new shoes. Abandoned building. Spicy dark candied fruit, soaked for ages to bring out their full aromas. Doctor's office. Faint smoke notes after sitting for twenty minutes now. Then comes a sweet rum cake character after the thirty minute mark. This is still going, changing back to alcohol and leather with the soaked figs in the background. Amazing, and fun as hell.
Taste- Liquid dark fruit, fully aged and spiced to perfection. Rich malt backbone that anchors the complexities of the carnival going on inside the mouth. Alcohol is well hidden in the taste, but far more obvious to my fine motor skills. Absolutely wonderful. 
Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Slick and viscous, with aromatic and gustatory qualities that beg to be savored. Everything a trappist quadrupel could ever hope to one day become. 1,368 charactersyelterdow, Jul 31, 2005
4.28/5  rDev -4.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Deep brown, almost black, pour with a nice off-white head. Leaves huge sheets of lace in my St. Bernardus chalice. Quite a bit of sediment swirls around and settles to the bottom. 
Smell is lots of fruits, particularly a clear plum scent and some oak. A bit of chocolate and some licorice in the nose, too. 
Flavor is heavily alcoholic, fruit, bitter chocolate, and a bit of sweetness. Lots of doughiness as well, and the fruit character gets stronger (plum and figs especially) as it warms. The alcohol is heavy and warming in the finish, but it doesn't bite too badly. A bit of raisiny goodness comes through as well. 
Mouthfeel is creamy, smooth, and full. Nice!
Overall: I'm really glad I picked this one up; there's a lot going on in there, and it drinks really well for its ABV. Really tasty. Nicely done.

 The taste is of figs, dark cherries, a leathery dryness percieved at the back of one's tongue, and brown sugar. This needs some time in my cellar, methinks. The mouthfeel is thick, but it is not cloying. Drinkability is high. The taste is so complex, I want to sip, and sip again to discover everythig this brew can offer. 519 charactersSephiroth, Jul 25, 2005
4.29/5  rDev -4%look: 5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5The only downside to this one was a slightly soapy smell (yes, the glass was clean). Aside from what I took as a soapy smell this wasn't as fragrant as other brews of the style.
Thick, sticky head and lacing... beautiful deep color to this critter.
A ripe to carmelized banana thing going on in the flavor; Chocolate/coffee milkshake with banana added.
Very, very smooth with a medium mouthfeel.
For a quadrupel that's 11.3% this is extremely drinkable.
This would make for an expensive habit as I paid $6 for an 11.2 ounce bottle... I find St. Bernardus and La Trappe (even Ommegang's Three Philosophers) make nearly as good or as good quadrupels; with money as a consideration they are much better choices.
Everything considered, this should be tried at least once.
Maybe twice. 787 charactersommegangpbr, Jul 23, 2005
4.9/5  rDev +9.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5People will review this beer by saying, "it has hints of blah and a touch of blah..." I can't do that with this one. That is all too subjective. 
Lets look at the bigger picture. 
We are raised on Budweiser and "Macro swill light" and all other ungodly crap. But to the average person, a big 11+ proof beer Is simply ludicrous. Say to the average Joe... "Have one of these... it tastes like port wine mixed with scotch, is as filling as possible, has free floating particles and has so many flavors that it changes on every sip... oh yeah, and it costs about $7 a bottle..."----And the average person says.. "I'll have a Miller light please." 
But... I had a bottle of terribly bad Zinfandel not too long ago that cost $10.99- I ate a flavorless breakfast sandwich that had 750 calories, not to mention a lifetime of beers that I have looked at and said, "why the hell am I drinking this?"(as I drank ten of them...) 
With that in mind... If you drink beer to pair with pizza or to get drunk or to be social in the local nightclub, This is not for you! This is a big, better-when-its-warm, drink out of a medieval chalice, pick stuff out of your teeth, don't need to eat for three days, if you drink two- you will surely have an unforgettable experience kind-of-beer. 
The stuff is darker than pepsi, smells like bubblegum, tastes like a big smooth latte, has no aftertaste and conceals the alcohol better when it is warm. I have never had Westvleteren 12; that being said, this is the best I have ever had. ALl beer snobbery aside, in my mind, you can keep the strong scotch ales and imperial stouts. This is the beer for real men.(and women). 1,655 charactersandjusticeforale, Jul 22, 2005
4.83/5  rDev +8.1%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Rochefort has three beers identified as six, eight and ten in the old system of Belgium degrees. Saw this Trappist 10 Belgium beauty at Highland Liquor Stop while there to pickup a "trade" arranged while visiting Three Floyds in nearby Munster, In. Best by 18 03 08 it is nicknamed " the Trappist beer for real men" and love by women and men around the world.
 Best served in 54°-58° and sips great as it warms to room temp. With the quietest pour possible from a undisturbed 33cl bottle I left the heavest part of the yeast slurry behind. I was happy to find the carbonation and head staying well within control - unlike some Belgiums- as I poured this murky dark brown Quadruple into Stone barleywine rastal that it topped with its dense tan head and thick curtain of lace that showed good retention for 11.3% abv.
A cornucopia of aroma and flavors - light tropical fruity esters (pear, apple, mango, bananna sweat tangerine and more) , mellow chocolate, carmelized fruit (pruness, raisons, figs and dates) with spicy alcohol and yeasty spicyness. Flavors shift like the patterns of a calidescope as the glass warms and the alcohol shows itself.
Medium full body with a smooth velvetly mouthfeel. Flavors well blended and were supurb - little aftertaste (the Styrian Goldings and German Hallertau Hersbrucker hops are very subdued anymore bitterness would be out of place) nothing cloying in the slightly dry finish. So drinkable! How did Michael Jackson overlook this in his Great Beer Guide of 500 Classics? Alas, he covers it well in his Beer Companion's chapter on Trappist Beer. Poor Mr. Jackson. So many beers. . .
The perfect end of a marinated grilled chicken meal with all the trimmings! Cheers from Mid.-Missouri Carpe diem. 1,750 characterskarst, Jul 21, 2005
4.62/5  rDev +3.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Amazing deal at Volo, $9 for one of the suckers. Pours a dark mahogany brown, pretty hazy, big head forms and goes but leaves a metric ass tonne of lacing. Smell is amazingly complex; almost weissbier like banana/clove esters and phenols abound, grapefruit, oaky vanilla, lots of malt, slight hint of alcohol. Taste is crazy, banana and clove once again, alcohol, earthy, oaky vanilla again, tastes oak aged, honey, a little bitterness from the hops but those take a back seat. Almost an armagnac vinousity (word?) to it, amazing. Very full mouth, warms all the way down, thick and chewy, perfect carbonation. This is one killer beer. 634 charactersViggo, Jul 20, 2005

Pours a dark brown with a hint of red. Nice small to medium bubbles. Got yeast in the glass even with a careful pour and leaving almost an inch in the bottle. It seems the yeast jumped into suspension when the bottle was opened due to the heavy carbonation. Sweet grape/pear, sherry, and yeast in the nose. Taste resembles the nose with the sherry flavor standing out over the others. Not overpowering, but distinct sherry overtones. Dry finish, slightly tart. Nice blend of flavor. The head is ever replenishing and maintains throughout drinking. Zero lacing on the glass? Looks can be deceiving on this one. Ignore the chunks of yeast and enjoy this one. 683 characterssacfly, Jul 19, 2005

Flavors are more powerful with elements of port wine, prunes, chocolate, and dark berry fruit. Perhaps theres just a touch of alcohol flavor in there as well. Probably too rich for more than one bottle at a time, or even one bottle per week, but this is still a masterpiece of brewing. 370 charactersfisherman34, Jul 18, 2005

Taste: Completely overpowering sweetness, kind of sickly to me. I know this is supposed to be top-shelf, but I honestly cannot stand the flavor. Reminds me somewhat of medicine.
Notes: This is a highly rated beer that many other people evidently appreciate more than me. I guess it just comes down to personal taste... 442 charactersTurdFurgison, Jul 16, 2005
4.32/5  rDev -3.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 3.5Appearance: Pours dark tan with a very quickly dissipating head that leaves lacing down the glass.
Smell: The smell is great, smells of spices, coriander perhaps black pepper, and dark fruits and alcohol.
Taste: Quite complex with everything very well integrated. For me the alcohol hits first then the sweet malts start to take over. I pick up definite prunes, and walnuts (ala nocino, a italian walnut liqueur made from unripe, green walnuts). Actually the whole brew smacks of nocino. A malty far more balanced nocino. Anyhow. There's also strong caramel and molasses overtones with everything dissolving away into a lingering spicy, alcoholic finish.
Mouthfeel: It's decently smooth and creamy, but nothing phenomenal for me.--Ok, i thought i had it warm enough, but i did not. After warming mouthfeel is a thing of beauty, very thick and rich.
Drinkability: It drinks like a wine, eh not quite so well.
I haven't been overly taken with the quarupels and tripels, but still, this is impressive. 1,013 charactersnumenor1, Jul 15, 2005
4.55/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Poured into my St. Bernardus chalice. It had a two finger head, but was very fizzy, and it dissipated rather quickly to a thin layer of foam. It was a deep brown in color, and slightly hazy.
Aroma was molasses, rich dark fruits, and a little spiciness, with a touch of alcohol at the end. However, strangely, it was a light aroma... not as heavy as one would expect from a beer this dark and high in ABV.
The taste was rich and complex, with dark fruits to the fore, followed by a blend of spices... subtle pepperiness and coriander. I didn't pick up any of the chocolate some people have mentioned. A sweetness came in toward the end, as the alcohol warmed my mouth. A little bit of a hoppy bitterness seemed to linger.
Mouthfeel was smooth and creamy, just right for the flavor. Not heavy or overbearing.
Drinkability... excellent beer. I would have it again. Not the absolute best quadrupel I have had, but very high up there. 941 charactersconnecticutpoet, Jul 09, 2005

It's a little too cold to pick up a strong aroma right now, so I'll hold off a bit on that and go ahead and have a taste.
Mmmm....smooth, creamy and simply sublime. Deep, soft sweetness full of complexity--molasses, dark brown sugar, the faintest touch of cocoa, and a thousand other things.

4.38/5  rDev -2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4This beer poured from the bottle a slightly hazy medium brown/dark amber in color. It was topped by a thick, clumpy tan head that retained for more than 10 minutes in my glass. The nose has bread dough up front followed by spice (coriander/allspice a hint of white pepper). It has layers of citrus (grapefruit/orange/lemon), and is finished by figs and dates from the malt. The taste has more of the bread dough followed quickly by the spice and citrus. The citrus combines with the malt in the flavor to produce red wine like flavors. Dark berries, plums, accompanied by slight alcohol warming. Wow! Amazing flavor, much more than even the nose indicated. Slick, lightly heavy mouth feel, decent drinakbility. 710 characterscarln26, Jul 04, 2005
4.87/5  rDev +8.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Picked up a 33cl bottle back in March for $7.42. Been saving the Trappistes for awhile now and it is now go time!
Pours a dark brown with ruby highlights with plenty of yeast sediment. Head is tan and initially large but quickly turns to a small sustained head. Nose is a medley of sugar, spice and everything nice including dark fruits and chocolate. The taste is one of the most complex beers I have ever had. The flavors are all over the board. Flavors noted include candied sugar, bananas, hint of pepper, dark fruits, finishing with a nice dry hop. Mouthfeel is creamy and full with a high amount of carbonation to light up the palate even more. Overall drinkability is near perfect. The only mark against this brew is the high ABV warms me up a bit too much after each taste. But nonetheless this is the 2nd best beer I have sampled yet! 846 charactersarizcards, Jul 03, 2005
4.3/5  rDev -3.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4The beer is deep rich chocolate brown colour with faint ruby highlights when held to the light. Light strains to get through the hazy liquid and the yeast in suspension. A generous spongy foam head built up initially only to leave in a hurry, however, leaving behind sizeable spots of brussels lace.
As would be expected of a Belgian Trappist, the yeast and its byproducts dominate the aromas. Fruity and peppery notes strike up front and slowly move aside to let mild spice, malt and breadlike aromas surface. The entire aroma profile is gentle and very harmonious.
Very round and fleshy (??) brew leaving the drinker with the impression that he has just eaten rather than drank the beer. That is how full bodied this beer seemed to me. Flavours mimic the aromas and are dominated by fruity and yeasty notes. However, the malt permeates much more in the flavours than it does in the aromas, lending the beer more balance. Hints of spices and cocoa do manifest themselves near the end along with a mild alcoholic bitterness, giving the beer a balanced and complex flavour profile that is as harmonious as the aromas.
This is one of my favourite trappists along with Orval. 1,181 charactersBeersignal, Jul 02, 2005

A: Dark brown, maybe some faint ruby highlights. Thinnish tan head. Lots of sediment in the glass, even with an uber careful pour.
S: Poured this into my Chimay chalice, I think I may have done it a disservice, seems like a tulip glass might better bring the nose out. Smells, hmm. Spicy. Strong smell of alcohol at first. There's a nice smell like a kitchen where sugar cookies are finished baking. That's nifty. Strong rum soaked fruit. Darkly rich malts (I don't know what that means, either, but that's the phrase my brain spewed forth).
T: Hot alcohol flash. Spicy. I don't know, this doesn't seem to be all that great. Leaves a bit of an unpleasant lingering whiskey-like aftertaste.
M: Too hot. The alcohol warmth of the Westy was like a light kiss on the cheek, this beer's warmth is like an angry school marm cracking my knuckles with a ruler. Moderate to high level of carbonation. Full body.
D&N: I gotta say, this one isn't doing anything for me. This one is fairly easy to get a hold of for me, but I don't think I'll be buying this one again.

Just as flavorful and robust as I remember. Cherries, prunes, banana, and dark chocolate are the most prominent flavors this round.

Appearance is dark brown with a nice thick head that dissipates into a thin layer after a few minutes. Looks awesome.
Smell is dark molasses, spice, dark fruits. A bit of candied sugar comes through. 
Taste is spicy alcohol at the forefront, followed up with roasty malt bitterness. Very dry in the finish.

Aroma has a lot of elements of raisins, candy sugar, toasted malts and a very light fruit. Swirl the snifter and the head reconstitutes with a trace of banana.
Taste is a sticky, sweet malt rum. Elements of dark macerated fruit, tea and some sharp hop bitterness, a variety of which I'm uncertain. Dry caramel malt, dark grainy, bready flavors like a whole rye or pumpernickel. Finish is dry with slight shades of yeast and a little apple or pear. (Fresh fruit elements become more noticeable as it reaches room temperature.) Not a trace of alcohol in the profile.
Mouthfeel is medium with enough biting carbonation to keep it clean. Reminds me more of a Belgian strong dark ale than a quad. I would love to try this fresh on tap, my rating would probably be higher than the small bottle. Many thanks to futaboots for rescuing a bottle for me. 933 charactersassurbanipaul, Jun 20, 2005

5/5  rDev +11.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Bottle obtained from John's Grocery (Iowa City) in June 2005 and consumed later that evening. Pours a 1 finger light-brown head over a dark ruby red liquid. Smells sugar sweet, alcohol, caramel, raisin...all this just during the pour. To the nose I get chocolate, toffee, raisin, pera, coriander, gentle orange, and the alcohol is very mild. My word that was amazing. How about a taste. Licorice, toffee, chocolate with a nice alcohol sting that is in line with the sweet and works well with the plethora of flavors that assault my mouoth. Rummy and caramel, brown sugar. Tastes like a warm sweet muffin with melted brown sugar trickled on each bite. Thick mouthfeel and mildly carbonated. There is no lacing on the inside of the glass, but there is a thin film of head that lasted all the way to the very last taste.
Phenomenal. Truly the most incredible and complex beer I've ever had. Just an amazing barrage of flavors, each standing noticable, but none towering over the others dominantly. The flavors work well together, chasing each other and blending into each other, only to re-emerge as a subtly redefined version of their prior selves. 1,149 charactersmentor, Jun 17, 2005

Smell: Phenols, and malt. Light coffee and molasses. Caramel also with a healthy dose of alcohol.
Taste: Deep and very malty and phenolic. Alcohol very present, almost out of balance. Brown sugar and molasses taste with a nutty aftertaste. Very good, but a little heavy in the alcohol.
Mouthfeel: Seemed a bit lighter than other quads, and carbonated a bit more, but it worked.
Drink: Just alright at 11.3% abv.
Overall: I thought this beer was definitely solid, but it wasn't as great as I thought it would be. To me I prefer St. Bernardus. I thought the alcohol was a bit out of balance in this beer and that caused me to downgrade it slightly. Believe me I like high abv. beers as much as anyone, i just thought it "stuck out" to me above all other flavors. I may have served it on the warm side though, so I'll give it another shot soon. I'd still recommend it though and would search it out to try it. 993 charactersejquin, Jun 09, 2005

I started with a purchase of two, which I've drunk in only four days. I am ordering twelve more, yes expensive, but well worth the pleasure.
I find this beer similiar to St. B's Abt 12, which is also one of my favorites.

Nose is brown sugar, raisins, and malty alcohol. Taste is malt and alcohol. I love these big beers that have a sweet whiskey feel on the tongue. Dark fruit, molasses, and an alcohol finish make this a delicious concoction. Mouthfeel is a little thinner than I would like, but doesn't detract from the experience.

Lacing is as thick as it comes.
The aroma is a Heavenly perfume ripe with notes of black cherry, apricot, pear, gingery spice, and dried fig. It is filled with dark caramel, toffee, and brown sugar sweetness and has a hop note of floral and spice. As others have noted, there is a distinct nuttiness to it that melds well with the creamy caramel in it. This is one of those beers that you must breath in for a full five minutes before sampling, wow.
A sip reveals a superbly crafted ale overflowing with flavors of dark cherries, apricot, tropical fruit, toasted almonds, coconut, berries, cocoa, molasses, yeasty spice and floral hops. There is so much going on here I can barely keep up. 
The mouthfeel is absolutely lush and creamy with a huge body supported by fine trickles of carbonation. Each sip gets better than the one before, amazing. This is by far the best Quad I've ever had and one of the finest beers period. It just doesn't get any better than this.
As always, thanks for sharing Gabe. 1,210 charactersAlexJ, May 30, 2005

color is quite amazing, an opaque orange caramel color. it looks like you should be able to see through it but you can't. little bit of caramel colored head that deminishes but retains a thin layer.
smells like chocolate and apricots or rasins. also has a hint of alcohol.
goes down very well. starts of sweet and slightly fruity and finishes with chocolate and alcohol flavor. as it warms, any harshness disapers and is delightful to drink.
don't drink it cold. it says on the bottle to drink between 54-58 degrees, but it is fine even warmer than that. i couldn't drink more than one or two in a sitting but definately awsome to have on special occasions. 816 charactersericsdawson, May 30, 2005

appearance: darkest of the three... brown as brown can be, approaching black in the center of my cup. not much foam. not any foam. a slight crown around the chalice's edge. the most clear of the three, and similar in appearance to WV12 and abt12. lacing is very thin and gets crunchy really fast. as always, bad-ass rochefort label kicks the appearance up a notch.
aroma: lighter on malt with big dark fruit up front. winey. sugar and campfire follow through. clean aroma for something so deep and complex.
taste: bitter dark malts hit you like a brick. finish is smooth thanks to the richer figgy notes. mouthfeel matches with a hefty luxury... like pureed fruit. approaching cognac in its caramel-meets-alcohol-sting-in-wood complexity. a sipper and perfect for near-room temperature. remarkable how something this sweet lacks that yeasty tartiness. it does, its an achievement. 898 charactersgoodbyeohio, May 23, 2005
5/5  rDev +11.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Appearance: Deep amber in color, with a small off-white head, excellent broken lacing, with scattered patches of sticky foam. The head lingers reaching toward eternity. Best if used by date is 04-08-09.
Aroma: Quite pronounced aroma of caramel and toffee, hazelnuts, alcohol, and earth. The hazelnut character is quite pronounced. Somehow or the aroma other this vaguely reminds me of a 5th Avenue candy bar - in a quite positive connotation.
Taste: Once again, the hazelnuts seem quite dominant, there is also cocoa, and an earthy character. A rich malt character is present from start to finish. The close of the taste is tart and very, very dry, with a lingering earthy note. 
Mouth feel: Smooth, rich, very full, almost syrupy, with only faint carbonation.
Drinkability/notes: An overwhelmingly superb beer, which challenges my powers of description. Quite likely the best beer I have ever had.
Thanks to HardTarget for generously sharing this stellar beer. 976 charactersPegasus, May 22, 2005
4.32/5  rDev -3.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4This is a good brew though it is so darn hard to review. It changes by the sip. This is clearly a sipping beer with some wallop to it. 
In appearance it is a cloudy chestnut brown with an abundant off-white head. Abundant coarse carbonation on the chalice sides.
Aroma is mollasses and caramel and sweet malt with slight floral undertones.
Taste is sweet toffee, dark dried fruit and strong alcohol warmth.
Qradrupel beers are sippers, not quaffers. I enjoy them whenever I can. This beer was pricey (5.99 a 11.2 Oz.)but I can now state it is worth the price. 571 charactersCitadel82, May 20, 2005
4.18/5  rDev -6.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.5I just picked up a bottle of this today, logged in here and saw this review, so I figure I'll give it a shot as well.
I'm an American college student living in London for a while, and this has been my first opportunity to legally purchase beer. Since I don't have to confine myself to the cheapest, easiest to chug then smash on your forehead beers anymore, I've been trying to try a wide variety of different kinds of brews. The idea of exclusive groups of Belgian monks making 'Trappist' beers in their abbeys intrigued me, and I'm trying to sample as many as possible while I'm in Europe. So far I've had Chimay Blue, Westmalle Tripel, and now this Rochefort 10.
Anyway, I don't know anything about reviewing beer, but this is a very good one. It comes off pretty strong, and it's obviously very alcoholic, but it's not harsh at all. It's a rich brown, with a lot of nice tan head initially, and it leaves a nice lacing on my glass, which I admit is not the recommended Trappist chalice. Still, it tastes great, and I can definitely see the coffee and chocolate, and the flavors linger on my tongue for a long time. I dig it.
All in all, well worth the three pounds or so I paid for it, and the long walk across town to get it. Especially when I consider that I'll probably end up paying more than that for a bottle of Budweiser in a bar later tonight. Cheers 1,371 charactersstopmakingsteve, May 07, 2005
5/5  rDev +11.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This beer is another absolutely flawless beer Rochefort. Even drinking this side by side with the 8 I can't find decide which is better as they are both so perfect in their own ways.
Poures a delecious creamy brown color with tons of thick pillow head.
Smell is a breathtaking variety of smells, with heavy toffee malts mixing with various dark fruits and hints of alcohol.
Taste is just fantastic, so many flavors mixing together so perfectly with just a touch of alcohol flavors. 
Mouthfeel is incredibly creamy and full with a nice alcohol warming.
Drinkability is incredible, I have drank several of these over the last couple months and I can't seem to get it enough. I could probably drink this everyday I think and never get sick of it. 758 charactersbashiba, May 05, 2005
4.4/5  rDev -1.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4I have been reading so much about this beer, now finally I have the opportunity. Of course dumb-ass, you wouldn't be writing about it if not.
Very basic bottle presentation, just as the Trappist monks. Pours a deep, deep brown, with a very polite head. Instantly you can smell the alcohol, followed closely behind by very earthy tones, cinnamon and forest greens (that doesn't make sense). The taste is definitely the strongest characteristic of this brew, breads, cloves, and something sweet.
Strong brew overall, considering the price it's not "drinkable", but ultimately is. If my typing is any indication at this point you'll come to know the alcohol quite quickly. 675 charactersFLAbeergutinMASS, May 03, 2005
4.47/5  rDev 0%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Bottle, best before sometime in 2009 (hinting that I shouldn't be drinking it just yet). I shouldn't be rating this, as I am recovering from a cold, however I decided to go ahead anyway because I think the beer has aided in my recovery. Only disappointment in the appearence was the small head. What was there laced pretty well. Deep effervescent chocolate amber colour made up for the disappointing head. Aroma, um, well, big! Spices, toffee, raisins, flowers, alcohol... Taste - um, well, huge! And it needs to be to get in before the alcohol which is considerable and smacks you in the face at the finish. Despite the big, warm, dry, (kinda like Australia) alcoholic finish, the balance remains very good, which is a big achievement. I think this is assisted by the fine carbonation which leads to a lush yet subtle feel. Would love to taste the same batch in 2009 to see what has changed. Think I might head back to the beer shop. 934 charactershefevice, Apr 30, 2005
4.49/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Hooo baby!
Pours a dark brown with a nice head. Dissipated kind of fast. Still, a beauty to behold.
Smells like a friggin' fruit basket. Hints of plum, orange, grapefruit, and prunes. 
Tastes beautiful. Sweet, fruity flavor. Definite raisin and prunes. Like the dried fruits I just described, this baby tastes aged and mature. Thick, full bodied, and absolutely delicious. Some yeast notes and a slight bit of spice round out this brew, with a tiny bit of carbonation which only enhances the savory character of it all. 
Awesome. 541 charactersLitterbean, Apr 26, 2005
4.62/5  rDev +3.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A bit of preface: my first experience with beer of this caliber was St. Bernardus Abt 12. I thought it couldn never be matched. Since then, I've seen numerous threads such as "St. Bernardus vs. Rochefort" or "Westvleteren vs. St. Bernardus." I haven't come across the Westy yet, but the Rochefort is always around so I thought I'd give it a try and see if it lives up to the hype. Let's crack this puppy open... Appears a very dark brown color, practically opaque with a big dark head resting on top, it doesn't appear to be going anywhere. Incredibily fragrant nose. A sweet cake-liek aroma out front, but no ordinary cake. It tingles your nose with hints of alcohol and spicyness. If this tastes as good as it smells I'll be a very happy man... Oh man it's good. Instead of comparing it to St. Bernardus it's really quite different. I can actually taste the alcohol in this and the spicy hops as well. Still the overriding taste is the sweetness, complex as it is, but there's a nice peppery quality to this beer that I didn't anticipate. Mouthfeel is nice and full, with the perfect amounth of carbonation. I don't know what it is, but there certianly is a distinct trappist feel to this beer that I wish I could identify and put into words, but I can't. For now I'll just enjoy it. 1,285 characterstwelvsies, Apr 19, 2005
4.32/5  rDev -3.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 3.5Dark brown with a nice but short-lived head. Very fizzy with smoke rising from the uncapped bottle.
Smells rich and complex. Roasted malt, almost like a stout, with nodes of coffee, along with the rich, ripe fruit of a good Belgian. 
And it tastes like a mixture between a good stout and a Belgian, too. Stoutier upfront, big coffee and chocolate, moving into a Belgian in the middle, rich fruit and an alcohol zip and fizz, and then ending in a combination of both. An earth taste prevades. Nice.
Exceptional mouthfeel, but the high alcohol is too present in the taste to make this an easy-drinking beer. It's exceptional, nonetheless. 645 charactersmynie, Apr 19, 2005
4.45/5  rDev -0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Really good all-around beer. I don't think that the alcohol is hidden as well as, say, the St. Bernardus 12, but it's pretty similar. 
Pours a murky brown color with little speckles floating in it, with no apparent head. Smell is great, a little like a fruity brandy with a touch of hops and wheat. The alcohol is hardly noticeable. 
The taste is great. The first sip is a little overwhelming because of all the tastes, but as you take more and more they go down much smoother. Alcohol is the first taste that you get, but then the beer effervesces on your tongue and the taste dissipates leaving behind a pleasant wheaty mouthfeel. As far as Trappist Quadruples this is debatable the top, and it is true to its reputation. 727 charactersToddv29424, Apr 17, 2005

Head: Slim, fast to disperse. The body seems black, but it's dark brown.
Nose: Huge, sweet malt, ripe fruits, and chocolates with heady alcohol in the undertones. This beer has such a nice aroma, I keep going back to it.
Taste: Oh man! Instantly gratifying. Rich, fine banana bread, spices, concord grapes(?).
Finish: Dry. Faintly tart, just a touch of bitterness.
My thanks go to John at Federal Wines & Spirits for donating a bottle of this exceptional beer. 583 charactersMrSeth, Mar 30, 2005

To liken this to any soda borders on blasphemy. Nevertheless, the taste was at once reminiscent of a rich chocolatey espresso I had in the islands, albeit shades more subtle all around.
I almost fainted tasting this puppy - my God, was it delicious!
I edge Abt 12 over this purely because of personal preference; I could return to this world in future reincarnations and easily favor TR10 as my life fluid.
Carefully fruity, rich, sublime and at once captivating in the sensuality it exudes. A remarkable brew. 553 charactersPingotas, Mar 28, 2005
4.6/5  rDev +2.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4330 mL, bottled on 8/4/04. The bottle overflowed with foam when I popped the top - really sucks when you're paying $7 for less than 12 oz. of this stuff. Served just under room temp. in a Chimay chalice. Pours a cloudy dark red/brown with a fizzy, 1 finger, tan head that doesn't leave much lacing but doesn't disappear either. Smell is rum bread, cherries, bananas, green apples, and maybe a hint of chocolate. At first the carbonation is tingly but is very nice by the end. And so many flavors on the palate... cherries, plums, apples, bananas, pears?, citrus?, coriander?, chocolate, rum, pine, yeast... whew! The beer also alternates between buttery/sugary/sweet and a somewhat powerful bitterness, both of which complement the other flavors well. The alcohol is well hidden in the taste but very warming. Pairs perfectly with milk chocolate. If I drank another of these right now I would be out another 7 bones but I would be oh so happy....and very intoxicated. 967 charactersmmmbeer, Mar 25, 2005
4.44/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Appearance: A murky chocolate brown with a firm, off-white head. Great duration. Leaves lace on glasswall.
Smell: Rich. Fruity esters (green/red apple), raisin, cocoa butter, a bit of cake spice, brown sugar, chocolate orange slice, butterscotch diacetyl, the WTF!? duo of soy sauce and cigar ash and, finally, alcohol and solvent vapors. This thing really unwinds as it warms, let me tell ya.
Taste/Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel is full and coating, but the carbonation is surprisingly crisp. Slight alcohol burns off the bat, but soon a sweet maltiness reveals itself. There's some molasses, yeast spice and white pepper, fruitcake, dark fruit, slight hint of milk chocolate and a nice splash of pineapple/orange juice. Despite all this, the finish is oddly dry.
Drinkability: Good, but at almost $8 for an 11.2, it's simply too pricey to be "drinkable." Still, it's nice to have the real deal, and the beer is really well balanced, it's controlled, complex--it's just flat-out good. If you can bear parting with the cash, it's quite a beer. 1,047 charactersWetCoaster, Mar 22, 2005

The flavor, smooooth and rich, the alcohol doesent dominate the glass, wonderful balance. I enjoyed this with some nice cheese, savoring it like a 20 year tawny port. The trappistes really do some amazing things with yeast water malt candy sugar and hops.Any one who calls themselves a BA should consider the five trappist breweries offerings required drinking, they wont regret a sip of it 684 charactersedchef1850, Mar 21, 2005

What a fantastic smell - prunes, raisins, molasses, and cherries.

First swigs: Bold awl-kee-hawl & cake malts. Nearly gin like in the palate. Lingering peppery flavor with a smidgeon of yeasty aftertaste. Almond middle. Fresh ginger and gingerbread with vanilla anisette & confectioners sugar.
Soft plushy carbonation. Sneaky full body satin feel.

No head to speak of but given the abv that's to be expected. Nose of fruits - plum, blackcurrant - and alcohol. Taste is of rich sweet malts with some yeasty notes and backed with strong plum and blackcurrant flavours and finishing with warming alcohol. Very nice mouthfeel with delicate carbonation. This is a lovely beer and one which I have had a number of times of ocassions and will continue to come back to. Surprisingly drinkable given its abv.

4.57/5  rDev +2.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Upon popping the cap, a tongue of mist escaped the bottle. Vapor trails.
how it looks: 
I poured this into a Hoegaarden Speciale snifter and it produced a full and foamy head, tan with purplish edges. A bit of lace, sticky, leaving little islands of murk.
The beer is the color of dark walnut and not as cloudy as expected.
how it smells:
At first fruit, esters, chocolate covered cherries and tangy melon. Wow. Then turkish taffy, raisins, nutmeg and bananas, followed by hints of dusty cocoa powder. Very rich and inviting. An assault on one's powers of olfactory discernment.
how it tastes:
Initially, lots of edgy carbonation and fruit, figs and foam. What follows is that wonderful Fernet Branca herbal bitterness. The alcohol warms and slides, glycerine-like, around the back of the tongue, even burns the back of the throat a bit. As it warms, more of the roasted malt, bready and yeasty character takes over, along with a distinct dark chocolate flavor.
the other stuff:
It has a luxurious, silky mouthfeel. While the alcohol is obvious, it's in the right place and doesn't intrude. Very drinkable in small quantities - like, one bottle as a nightcap with some stinky cheese. 1,200 charactershorndecker, Mar 09, 2005
4.35/5  rDev -2.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.5Brown 33cL bottle, ten minste houdbaar tot ende: 25.08.09.
Appearance: Nut-brown, cloudy, very flocculent syrup in a Chimay chalice. Sticky head clinging to sides of glass with a weird volcanic effervescence transgressing from the murky depths of this Quadrupel into our world. Looks like someone has cracked an egg on the central surface of my beer, except inside the egg was only a thin layer of froth.
Smell: Not entirely accessible from the head alone (may have been served slightly too cold), the main scent is that of vanilla, as experienced in a creamy Highland Malt. Some unusual herbal characteristics as well.
Taste: The dense liquid's effervescing alcohol tickles the tongue and back of palate before other subtleties are explored. Another strange flavour fizzes on the roof of my mouth but I can't put my finger on it - pepper? ginger, without the pungent aftertaste? It's more the effect this beer has on the mouth than the specific notes that is important. Effervescent in a prickly way, with small bubbles; alcoholic almost like a malt whisky. In fact, warming it with my hands and smelling it, I could be drinking a single malt. Slightly nutty and yeasty as well; this feels like a real privilege to drink.
Mouthfeel: Buttery/creamy, but with the aforementioned zing to it. A shoulder-tapping reminder of the sophistication as well as strength of this beer comes upon swallowing.
Drinkability: Smooth, but too jam-packed with full-bodiedness and alcohol to drink quickly. I feel like I could even have another couple of beers on the go, to refresh me while I'm sipping down this one. This is really strong and would be good to drink very slowly with a several-course meal. However, other Trappist ales are as complex in flavour but also permit a more normal drinking pace. This one is impeding me, and it's making me sleepy.
Notes: It's almost as if the monks got two or three normal beers and concentrated them into this complex ale. This is such a mysterious beer that people could likely imagine many other flavours than actually exist. However, it's not my favourite style, and not my favourite Trappist ale: Westmalle (Tripel) is much more friendly and accessible (in flavour, not price or availability) to most people. But this beer is best reserved for special occasions and lazy winter nights. 2,335 charactersWeizenmensch, Mar 08, 2005
4.82/5  rDev +7.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a deep red beer thats all clear and quite some carbonation that creates an island of foam in the middle of my chalice.
Smell is immense. Alcohol and green apples comes first. Rum, spices are strong together with more alcohol. Somewhat malty, yeast in there as well as sweet fruits together with dough and bread. Lots and lots of ripe fruits in there, pears, figs and apples.
Taste also hits alcoholic. Big, thick taste with tons of ripe, sweet fruits. Some carbonation lifts alcohol and gives room for spices, malts and perhaps some chocolate or tobacco? A lot of ripe fruits such as figs, pears, melon (cantalope) and such. More sweet and filling taste explodes on palatte when the sweet alcohol bursts through with more and more taste. Malt comes through stronger when it warms up a bit and alcohol resides for more of the frits and perhaps honey, yeast and dark sugar?
Immense beer! Smooth, fruity and extremely well balanced. I certainly prefer this over the 8, this was more complex and more satisfying. Rich on everything, lacks nothing. 1,058 charactersstjarnflikka, Mar 06, 2005

Poured out dark brown, almost chocolate in appearance with a big foam head that dissapeared fast.
The smell was great. It was a mixture of malt and fruit. Went down a treat as well. A cavalcade of taste in your mouth. Starts off with a deep maltiness which then turns fruitty and then transforms into a chocolate/coffee finish.
The low carbonation, makes it go down well. Easily a sipping beer. Would drink it again. Just a bit costly in Australia. The 8.95 price tag per bottle stings a bit.

Chocolatey brown liquid with a thin, lacing head. The aroma of choclolate, brown sugar, hints of green apple and cinammon. Tastes of wine- like acidity, apples, pears, maple syrup.
The mouthfeel was bubbly yet very silky and smooth and the drinkability is outstanding although my wallet wouldn't allow for it.

Smells of bready yeast, bannanas, dried plums, malts, and and a touch of alcohol that is slightly "winey".
The yeast, and plum like flavors are still there when tasted. There's a lot going on here, very complex. The full bodied mouthfeel works together with the carbonation. There's some twinge from the alcohol, but it isn't out of place and the warming effect is perfect for a cold night. However, the high abv makes this one a slow sipper. 546 charactersypsifly, Feb 26, 2005

The nose was a mix of raisins, alcohol, plums, dark ripe fruit, chocolate, caramel, very subtle wood and even some fireplace bricks. Really luscious European milk chocolate. Hints of citrus fruit even. Yeast and a very mild, almost non-existent phenol smell.
Thick and very full bodied with a fine carbonation. Dark roasted malts dominate with this nice touch of smoky fireplace brick like roastyness. Sort of like licking the inside of a fireplace but with a rich dark chocolate flavor. Soft fruit tones that intermix with the malt. The alcohol is almost completely hidden. Very smooth and very drinkable, Theres a mild but very present mint, wood and earth hop bitterness. Under the radar but its there and makes a nice balance. Some tart fruits with almost a tequila like flavor, odd but yummy.
Just a classic Belgian strong ale. A great mix of dark chocolate, malt and fruit. Yum, yum, give me some more. 985 characterstaez555, Feb 14, 2005

The aroma was a nice mix of malt sweetness, fruity esters and alcohol.
 As to be expected the beer was very malty up front but of an amazing complexity. Deep in there were some black cherry flavors noticeable but the remainder was to me beyond description. 
Nice medium-full body with some creaminess and very noticeable alcohol warmth. 
Beautiful beer all around but be careful having too many of these in a row as they may impair your ability to taste and rate any other beers accurately. 691 charactersscottbrew4u, Feb 02, 2005

A rocky dense white head sit on top with a little brown in the middle from the yeast. The foamy head sticks to the side of the glass as it is drank and swirled. The only thing that can be improved is maybe a little more clarity to allow some more color to come through.
This brew packs a powerful aroma and flavor. Smells of yeast and cherries and raisins followed by medicinal alcohol come through.
Flavors of rich malt and yeast are followed by dark plum and strong alcohol and a bitter earthy aftertaste. The alcohol is a little too powerful in the finish. Overall this is an intense beer with very complex flavors and moderate drinkability. Definatley one to seek out. 750 charactersyeagerbm, Feb 01, 2005

Very smooth, though a slight tinge of alcohol taste at the roof of the mouth, I don't really mind that. Tasted better as it warmed up.

It poured with a deep brown and opaque body with a head that was cloudy, tannish, and substantial. The nose is alluring with notes of raisin, malt, and/or plum. The mouthfeel is almost chewy but also has a juicy texture. The fullness is also there. I mostly sense a raisin and brandy-like character that is complemented nicely by a juicy malt kick. You can finally get a sense for that high alcohol content right at the beginning of the finish. Mostly you get a continued raisin and plum layer that is balanced by a nice little bitter balance about midway through the finish. By mid-bottle, you realize how much of a belly warmer this really is. Truly a world class beer. Ah the trappists! 736 charactersHhawk06, Jan 21, 2005

It has a very rich and intense roasted malt scent that boasts of roasted barley and Belgian caramel malts; very nice. It is sweet and dry. The taste is good. It has a creamy, yet powerful brown ale flavor with lots of caramel malts and a tart yeast finish. It goes down smooth and is surprisingly thin and dry on the finish. The mouthfeel is decent. It is a medium bodied brew with adequate carbonation. This is a great tasting brew with lots of enticing malt aroma. I wish it had a little more body, but otherwise it's a good drinker. 657 charactersWesWes, Jan 19, 2005
4.63/5  rDev +3.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Picked up a bottle of this legendary brew at my local HyVee Wine & Spirits. I don't understand the hype of a lot of Belgians..maybe they'll grow on me, i don't know..but up until this point, many have not been to my liking. Rochefort 10 opened my eyes quite a bit....
Appearance: Pours a dark brown color and leaves a relatively thin, beige head on the top. Lacing is excellent. Very foamy, creamy, and sticks to the glass well.
Smell: Aroma is nothing like I've ever smelled. Very complex. Fruity..surprisingly chocolately... Maybe a little bit of spices but mostly a sweet, malty aroma. Alcohol is definitely present.
Taste: I really don't know what else I can add that the previous reviews don't... so many flavors, extremely complex and rich. As other BAs have noted, can definitely pick up chocolate, fruits, and the obviously apparent alcohol. The ABV is icing on the cake, and no doubt, you can taste it. Not overpowering, but present nonetheless...a warmer in every sense of the word. So sweet and complex that it's hard to describe. Sweet fruit nectars injected with caramel, almost sickly-sweet chocolate, with the most creamy finish you could imagine.
Mouthfeel: Exceptional mouthfeel. I'm convinced that the words rich, creamy, and smooth were all created with this beer in mind. Definitely medium to full-bodied...more carbonation than expected but despite the high alcohol and extreme complexity, very easy to drink (at least in small quantities).
Drinkability: Best beer I've ever had? I dunno..definitely not the most available or most practical, considering it's price and availability in the area. Is it worthy of being rated the 10th best beer in the world? absolutely. 11.3% ABV packed into an astoundingly complex Belgian such as this.. Meant to sip and enjoy, a pinnacle of the style and of beer in general. 1,844 charactershero27, Jan 18, 2005
5/5  rDev +11.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5First experience: 4.3 / 5
This beer didn't quite live up to the hype for me, especially after the Rochefort 8 I had several hours earlier more than surpassed my expectations.
The beer pours to a dark golden color that thickens to a dark maroon color as the liquid fills. The head wasn't quite as perfect with such tiny uniform bubbles as was the 8. The bouqet also seemed to be somewhat less pronounced.
The taste had a raisin and red wine hint on the tip of the tongue complemented by malty sweetness. Something in the brew seems to have tickled my sour tastebuds as well, but I can't quite place it. The body was thick and syrupy, damn near unpleasant with the heavy alcohol and carbonation paired with the sweetness.
After this experience I am actually looking forward even more to the Rochefort 6, which I have just discovered is suuposedly "hard to acquire." I have to thank John's Grocery in Iowa City for giving me, who lives in the middle of nowhere Iowa, the chance to drink such finely crafted and rare Belgian brews.
---
Second Experience: 5.0 / 5
After a new batch of this came in (the first batch imported to the US since by Merchant du Vin as opposed to Shelton Bros), my judgement has changed. This beer knocks the socks off of any other beer I've ever tasted. Has a nice bubblegummy taste and aroma with a plethora of fruity esters. Just the perfect balance between sweet, dry, and bitter. Just enough alcohol punch to get you a nice buzz without going overboard. By the way, it seems much less boozy this time through to the point where it is damn near chuggable. I must stock up on this stuff. 1,628 charactersneonbrown82, Jan 18, 2005
4.05/5  rDev -9.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Pours with a large off-white head that dissipates to a smaller lingering head, leaving no laing behind. A fairly clear dark brown with a bit of orange highlights.
Just a slight hop bouquet under a roasted coffee, chocolate aroma. A nice yeasty undertone to this one.
Flavor is composed of sweet malts dark fruits, especially prunes, figs and dark cherries. lots of molasses backbone and finishes really warm form the alcohol.
Good carbonation level and fairly heavy bodied, definitely not your session ale here.
Excellent ale, just a bit heavy on the alcohol, not hidden very well. 593 charactersWolfsdenbrew, Jan 18, 2005
3.36/5  rDev -24.8%look: 4 | smell: 3 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3what a find, and a steal for 5 bucks, or so i thought.
appearance was brown with a nice size head that stuck around for a bit (with the help of a vigourous pour). i was careful to leave the yeast in the bottle and save it for later.
aroma was of mild caramel malts, nothing special. hopefully the taste is where it's all at.
taste is a bit spicy, and malty. very muddled and lactic flavour profile. tastes like an average belgian, but nothing great.
drinkability was a bit low, since i kept thinking that i would rather be drinking something that tastes good.
i love belgians, and so i'm hoping this was a bad bottle or that perhaps &lt;gasp&gt; my taste was off today. maybe i will try it again but from a different source. 739 characterstrancefishy, Jan 17, 2005
4.57/5  rDev +2.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Poured from a nice little 330mL bottle into an oversized wine glass (closest to a chalice that I had). Pours a swampy, muddy deep brown with a mild sticky brown tinged head. Smells of apples, a little baker's chocolate, and a tiny bit of... sweet tarts. 
 As for the taste... well... I actually don't think my vocabulary is developed enough to really describe everything going on here. A full tingling sensation hits the tongue, and a full, dusky roasted character socks me in the jaw; like a combination of toast, burnt marshmallow, coffee, chocolate, and toffee. Then a little burn and belly warming as it goes down. Then you notice a tiny bit of sweetness. How did they balance all this stuff in there?
I get interrupted for a phone call while trying this one, and it strikes me as I go back to it 5 minutes later- I'm STILL tasting the last sip. 
All I can really say, is 'Oh, my gawd....Wow' when describing this one. I think I agree that it needs to be at proper temperature- there's too much going on here that you don't want to miss. I certainly think this deserves to be paired with a very special meal. I do think that EVERYONE, no exceptions, must try this at least once in your life; my advice is: go slow....
The only think I can really ding it on is drinkability; even though the 11%+ alcohol is hidden pretty well, there is just a little harshness that comes through. Nothing that should steer anyone away from having this on their 'best beers' list. 1,471 charactersamicar, Jan 15, 2005
4.77/5  rDev +6.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4I didn't have this one for a very long time. Quite a rendez-vous, it was a lot better even than the last time I recall drinking it. I made sure I had it on exactly the right temperature though, wich is crucial when drinking this beer. It really loses a lot of it's character if it's served too cold, and it becomes too sweet and overpowering if it's served too warm.
This one pours a murky dark brown brew with an attractive, medium-sized head that drops to a foamy layer after a couple of minutes.
The initial smell is very sweet and fruity. Lots of banana's, as well as raisins, orange peel, plums and wine-like notes.
The second sniff revealed some caramel aroma's and some faint bitterness as well.
The taste starts of pretty sweet and fruity. Dark fruits, banana, roasted malts and caramel dominate the taste that finally flows out in a spicy, mildly bitter, hoppy finish. You can feel the high alcohol content rather than taste it. The beer really warms the throat and tummy. The brew itself doesn't have too much carbonation, but is thick, creamy and smooth. This makes for an excellent mouthfeel. The drinkabillity is good considering this is an 11,3% brew, still the high ABV is not to be underestimated. I think having two or three of these would get you as drunk as a cannonball.
In my opinion, this beer is a little better than the St. Bernardus 12. Like my brother said, it is a bit 'like drinking liquid applepie'. A magnificent brew. 1,457 charactersPaddez, Jan 13, 2005
5/5  rDev +11.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I will have to admit at first try I was not very impressed with this one. I read all the reviews and thought that this had to be better so I went out and bought alot more of them. I found out that with this and all other trappist beers you have to be really careful at which temperature you serve this at. Ounce I got that down I found the dark appearance rather inviting. After talking to many belgium people at the different festivals I found that many of them like this it's just what they call a beerwine. So I took that to heart and treated it like wine before every drink I will swish it around and smell it, for me that is enough, I'm in love. The taste is phenomenal with just that right bitter taste that from much research comes from the water. The fruitiness of this is bar none only to westvleteren which also has a distinct fruity taste. For convenience though I stick with rochefort. For anyone looking for a top notch beer that will surprise them from aroma till aftertaste this is a must have. 1,009 characterspaulaner, Jan 10, 2005
4.62/5  rDev +3.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Wow, this beer had me on the first sip. I first noticed the subdued fruity character and how it's well supported by caramel-like sweetness. The carbonation is a little light, but fizzy enough for a little panache. There are some floral characters as the taste emerges as well as some much appreciated bitterness. 
I'd go on to say some more, but I think I'm going to savour the rest of this drink. 400 charactersalexAK, Jan 09, 2005
4.62/5  rDev +3.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.533 cl. October 14, 2008 freshness date. Purchased at Shawan Liquors in Hunt Valley, MD. 65 degrees.
The beer is dark brown with some red with lingering sediment running about the glass. The chunky, bubbly cream-colored head dissipates slightly but is retained in about a 2mm thickness throughout the drink. Lacing is present and sturdy but not overwhelming. Carbonation is certainly evident upon first sip but its run over with a rummage of caramel, paper early, yeast, fruitiness, and tempered hops. The smell is as busy as the taste. Taste is light spice, molasses, raisin, maybe plum. The 10 is eminently creamy smooth and drinkable considering its ABV. Goodness. Top shelf. Beer heaven. Praise the Belgian monks. 723 charactersWonka, Jan 08, 2005
5/5  rDev +11.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This is one great Trappist creation. In fact of all the Trappist beers, this is my favorite. The moment that bottle is opened and the dark, almost black, brew hits the chalice, I would swear that I've made it to heaven. I love smooth, malty, fruity, caramely, high ABV Belgian browns and a Rochefort 10 has all of this. If you're a hop head, or a pale ale fan stay away. If Coors Light is your main staple, dial 911 first. Some may say that this one is too sweet or too strong. The fizz water people might even say that it doesn't taste like any 'beer' that they've ever had. ( Hint: Carbonated horse urine isn't beer.) That's a good thing. That means there's more for me and everyone else who have a clue. 
 If I'm ever stranded on a desert island and I run across that proverbial magic lamp, here's my three wishes...
1. Westy 12
2. Rochefort 10
3. Don't tell anyone I'm here. 885 characterscro250klr, Dec 29, 2004

Taste is nice, although not all that remarkable. There's a little chocolate, with some dried fruit just as in the smell. Very full mouthfeel (this is the best part).
Based on other reviews, not to mention my previous tasting of Rochefort 8 (plus St. Bernardus 12), I'm wondering if I got a bum bottle. Not that this isn't good, it's just that nothing jumps out at me. Based on the price this one, I could get twice the amount of beer for less than twice the cost by buying the St B 12... 580 charactersskybluewater, Dec 21, 2004

I have had several bottles of this over the past year, but this is the first time Ive tried to describe it.
Pours out cloudy murky dark brown with a 1" head. 
Head receads to a thin cap atop this glorious brew.
Lacing coats the glass in a thin sheet.
Aroma is complex, dusty, plummy, raisins, currants, winey, banana, alcohol, with a touch of burnt sugar.
Flavor is sweet, raisin, malt, dark fruits, caramel, all enveloped by a mildly hoppy finish. Alcohol is not detected in the flavor, but it is when it hits the belly.

Poured into an Ommegang chalice, formed a 1/2" creany beige head above the whirling burgundy brew. Head hasn't moved in five minutes, and the heavy foam lacing looks great. Interesting fruity, esterous aroma. Taste takes the aroma to another level. Smooth malt character quickly gives way to flavors of banana and other fruits, with a slightly spicy aftertaste. Mouthfeel is tremendous, and drinkability is excellent as well. Scarily drinkable for 11.3%, the alcohol hardly comes out at all, except for the subtle warming after you've had a few mouthfuls. A must try, and revisiting will be inevitable. 683 charactersppoitras, Dec 17, 2004
4.77/5  rDev +6.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4I have been drinking this marvelous brew for a while now, and just now realized that I had never reviewed it. What a terrible mistake. This is on my list of all-time favorites.
Pours a slightly murky brown with slightly purple/red tints (but you really have to look for them) with a medium off-white head (if the right temp) to almost no head (if poured too cold). The aroma is to die for- rich, full of wonderful warm fruitcake bread (the best kind, not the stuff passed from generation to generation), semi sweet, and carmel and toffee and candied fruits. Flavor follows through, but with a wonderful warming alcohol (not overpowering like many strong brews). Mouthfeel is rich- ok, very rich. The best chocolate in the world rich...
Drinkability is a shortcoming, but only because of its ABV. If it wasn't so strong, this would be 5's across the board (but only because it doesn't go to 11)!!! By the way, did I mention that I like this beer? 951 charactersDukeofearl, Dec 16, 2004

Smells amazing. Very fruity and woody. Hint's of vanilla and cocoa and even some dark soda. Very complex smelling. Tasty perfectly spicy and sweet. A brilliant mix of flavors. Nutty, gingerish tastes explode into the mouth. The sweet malts are so well balanced with the bitter hops it blows my mind. The more I drink the more flavor arises showing brand new sides of the beer. This a not just a drink. This is not just a beer.

Dark russet brown with reddish hued highlights. Dense, creamy looking off white meringue like head caps the liquid. Retains very well & leaves a lovely sheet of lace behind.
Malty, chocolate, burnt fruit, & a hint of perfume.
Intensely sweet. Astonishing layers of dark fruit - figs, prunes, raisins & dates. A touch of chocolate is followed by a firm bitterness. Finishes with some slightly herbal flavours. Dry, pleasantly astringent & warming. Robust carbonation, medium-full bodied. 546 charactersxgrigorix, Nov 15, 2004
4.83/5  rDev +8.1%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5The beer poured into the chalice clear deep dark brown with a ruby cast. The head was off-white also with a ruby cast. The head rose very tall, taller than the other two Rochefort beers combined and then fell very, very slowly to lace the sides of the chalice.
The aroma was deep dark estery caramel with deep dark fruits, raisins and prunes giving the aroma a nice complexity. The higher alcohols added to the esters gave a spice that tickled the nasal passages. 
The flavor was incredibly smooth with deep dark fruits of raisins, plums and prune flavors in a complex mix with deep dark carmamel malts perhaps special B and aromatic. The flavor complexity was very nicely done and the alcohol, while present, does not detract and added esters and belgian yeast spice.
The finish was even with pleasant lasting deep dark fruits, alcohol, and spice long into the aftertaste. The body was medium full but seemed less due to the alcohol and carbonation.
33 cl bottle. Date code on bottle 06 02 07. Underneath the lable the beer is silk screened. I may have to soak off the label and seen what lies beneath. What a great beer. Nice complexity of flavors. Alcohol that contributes to complexity yet never overpowers the flavor and even in the aftermath of warming only adds to the appreciation of the beer, never detracts. I am unsure what I paid for this beer, but it was certainly worth every penny. 1,408 charactersGCBrewingCo, Nov 05, 2004

This beer is beautiful dark brown with some reddish highlights. If you look carefully you can see that it's chock-full of suspended sediment, which I'm guessing is what makes for a such a thick mouthfeel. The head dissipated pretty quickly, but never quite went away entirely. And the smell... oh man, the smell. I must have spent the first five minutes just huffing this exquisite brew. I've never smelled anything like it. I swear I got buzzed just from smelling it. I think the alcohol vapours entered my bloodstream through my nose. Very strong caramel overtones.
Caramel was also prevalent in the taste, along with chocolate and something almost whisky-like. 
This is easily the best beer I've ever tried. 764 characterschunkylover53, Oct 25, 2004

Smell: I could smell the alcohol in this a mile away. The strongest alcohol smell I've ever encountered in a beer. Improves ten fold as it warms.
Taste: Nuty and hearty, almost tastes like banana bread. Not a complex as some other Quads, but good. The St. Bernardus Apt 12 I had last night spoiled me. Sweet and sticky, dry finish. It really opens up as it warms and takes on a dark chocolate flavor. I really recommend letting this one warm before drinking it.
Mouthfeel: Thick and velvety like I expected.

Taste, this is worth noting, it started very stealthy, dark fruits, and some malts, but going down it is smooth, almost unbelivably so. The world slowed to a crawl around me and for what seemed like an eternity there was nothing be me and the beer. I heard a buzzing in my ears and noticed my friend what talking to me, I told him to give me a minute.

Ok, ok. This is darker than it's siblings. 
Stand aside! 
It bears within it an aroma of latex paint, baked pavement, fruit pie and Puerto Rican rice. Amazing!
Caramel/mocha milkshake flavors dominate the piney, forest floor heathen qualities. The pinnacle of the series, utterly natural, rocky, liqueur-like, creamy and dense. What a loss, all of those denied this pleasure.
___
Now today, I would write the review like this:
There is an admirable effort to maintain a sheet of various-colored foam : "mocha" is one of the colors. The aromas describe top-notch grappa and raisins, macerated together. There is also an aggressive smell of nuts, graphite and flint. On the palate it is woody and intense. I'm still getting a Seafood Rice thing in the flavors (Imagine a cauldron filled with oyster shells, saffron and rice. I assume this is a testament to the mineral content of the water here.) While alcohol drives a unkind pace through the flavor development (in contrast to a Southampton Grand Cru or Westvleteren 8, for example -- both of which stall delightfully on the palate to reveal even more bounty than one bargained for -- "cadence") it is a thrilling, 12-cylinder power which humbles the senses -- sort of like St. Sixtus yellow cap. The fine prickle of gas, laughing madly before the alcohol executioner, keeps the pace and makes the flavors come alive. These are the images that appear on the palate: vanilla, birch bark, poppy seed paste, grade B coffee, licorice and earth.
These Quadrupels are rarely appropriate and always a little hard to cozy up to, but nothing else in life approximates the sense of danger and possibility contained in them. 1,831 charactersputnam, Sep 29, 2004

This beer pours a nice opaque brown with about a finger of head that sticks around for the show. What a nice malty nose. I get a full in my face sweet fig nose with an alcohol punch that reminds me more of a liquor than a beer. The flavor is nicely balanced. There is the malty fig flavor, but it is balanced with a caramel sweetness and a smokey char finish. What a treat. Well worth the hype and the wait to drink it. Now I have to convince myself to let it warm a bit more before I finish it to see what else is hiding in the nose and flavor. The beer is thick with just a hint of small carbonation. Drinkability is top notch. I could easily handle a few of these, even with the high ABV. Its nice and smooth, without an offensive alcohol to make me want to slow down on it. I will be getting this one again, and soon. 903 characterskmpitz2, Sep 17, 2004

Smells of caramel rum raisin alcohol, nutmeg, and a hint of smoke. Flavor is sweet rum raisin in oak, cloyingly sugary. Rumminess is annoying. Finish really disappoints. Where are those beautiful yeasts? Oh that's right, they are covered up by the rum candy sweetness. Cough-syrupesque by the end. Feel is a little chalky and thicker than expected, but good. Finish is way too sweet and boring for me. I did not even want to finish the 11.2 ounce bottle.
A real disappointment for me. Where is the complexity? Just because it has alcohol doesn't mean it is good. No hops, and not all that much yeast character. I don't understand this beer. 729 characterswaughbrew, Sep 15, 2004

Mouthfeel would be better if there was more carbonation. Maybe Belgians just aren't my thing. Maybe this was a bad bottle? 404 charactersdeejaydan, Sep 14, 2004
5/5  rDev +11.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Bottle inspection: Best by Dated bottle (21-10-09), serving temperature suggestion (54-58 F) and an Authentic Trappist product symbol.
Aroma: I shed tears. Im unable and unworthy to describe this aroma. Take hard fruit candy, marshmallows, roses, licorice, pepper, and bubble gum and blend them. Some fruity flavors as well, raisin/banana, melon, rum soaked fruitcake, exotic spices and a hint of Juicy Fruit as well. Something about the smell says new like a new toy or a freshly opened Christmas present. Ive smelled this beer for 10 minutes before tasting it now, it is just intoxicating. 
Appearance: Black, with an odd greenish brown/tan color coming out in bright backlight. A creamed coffee head has patiently waited for me to keep smelling it. It started out at a good finger, now about a quarter, which lasts the hour I savor this gem. A small dot at the center of my goblet shows a small feed of very fine bubbles. Thick obscuring tight knit lace is painted on my glass as I work my way down.
Flavor: Have they genetically created chocolate melons yet? Where a chocolate covered honeydew melon doesnt sound great, it is the closest I can come to the major tastes I encounter. The chocolate is more of a chocolate milk taste and the melon has an orange bubblegum quality. Grapes and pears play a supporting role in making this beer work, as well as a mild mint flavor. At the half way point, I start to note a mild alcohol taste, but it only serves to enhance the other flavors.
Mouthfeel: So creamy, so smooth; Liquid silk. Fairly dry with a clean finish that cools my lips as it evaporates. Deeper into the beer, my mouth, face, throat, neck, upper body and tummy all have a nice, fireside warmth.
Overall Impression: Words fail me, this beer literally brought tears to my eyes. I saved this beer for my 200th review, and Im afraid Ive reached the end of my journey. I want this beer and no other. Thank you BA and Alström brothers for helping me on the journey. There is a world of complex tastes here that I could spend a lifetime exploring. I could drink this beer the rest of my life and die a happy man. If you are lucky enough to see this beer on a shelf somewhere, damn the torpedoes, buy a case! This is my first straight 5 beer. It works on all levels.
Mad props to stonecrusher for rocking my world. 2,343 charactersHardTarget, Sep 02, 2004
4.45/5  rDev -0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Package: 33cl brown bottle.
Presentation: Had a bottle of this at Anam Cara in Boston, MA. 
Appearance: Dark brown opaque color with tan head that thinned down but still laced nicely.
Smell: Sweet aroma of alcohol soaked raisins and grapes.
Taste: A wonderful mix of sweet raisin flavors followed by strong bitter peppery flavors. The flavors danced in my mouth back and forth between sweet and bitter throughout the flavor timeline. Very enjoyable and zesty multi-dimensioned taste.
Mouthfeel: Outrageously smooth with a good carbonation feel. Wow.
Drinkability: This went straight to my head after the first sip. It is so delicious and interesting that I would have had many more if not for the high ABV effect.
Comments: A very enjoyable big beer with multi-layered flavors. Outstanding. 811 charactersDenali, Aug 30, 2004

Anyway, onto the review
Appearance: Poured in a Chalice. Brown, with a thick, rocky tannish head. Cloudiness in the body. Head lasted for the entire glass...ample lacing.
Aroma: Good, intricate malt aroma. Raisins and figs seem to come to the forefront, with a fruity apple character providing a background contrast. Caramel maltiness present throughout.
Taste: Slight figginess initially, fading to a sweet caramel apple flavor. Prominence flavor of raisins/dates from the malt backbone. Alcohol provides a nice warming character that compliments the sweet fruitiness of the brew.
Mouthfeel: High alcohol, a bit lacking in body, for my tastes (with the amount of alcohol present in this brew)
Drinkability: If I didn't have a talk to go to, this would have been a repeat performer there and then, regardless of the $10 price tag. 979 charactersPartyHatjo, Aug 26, 2004
4.05/5  rDev -9.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5New thoughts: I'm knocking this down a bit. I've had multiple bottles of this recently, and this beer sucks. Well, at the very least, it's not the same as it used to be. It's still OK, but much of the complexity is gone, leaving sheer size in its place. Size has its rewards, but that's not what this beer used to be nor what it should be. What used to be spices, brown sugar, and bitte plum skin leading to a strong alcoholic finish is now just sweet booze. I've heard that the aging/lagering period on this is a fraction of what it once was to help them keep up with demand. Is this true? If so, I have no doubt that's the cause of my newfound Rochefort rage.
Originally reviewed 7/24/2003 (4.45 total score)
From that review:
Mahogony color with a nice fluffy head. Definitely caught glimpses of sediment sliding out of the bottle into the glass. Aromas of prunes, bitter plum skin, and alcohol. Flavor begins similarly ripe but pushes into a peppery, alcohol-dominated finish. Very light hints of oak and vanilla dance around a bit as well. 
This doesn't even remotely hide the alcohol content. It celebrates it. A delicious offering when it's all said and done. 1,176 charactersmarburg, Aug 25, 2004
4.75/5  rDev +6.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Second Review:
Pours a dark opaque brown with a thick, creamy, tan head. The head dwindles and leaves lacing that is thick and clingy; CO2 only visible along the edge of the head. Aroma is malty, roasted, spicy and some hints bubblegum. The flavors are sweet, roasted, fruit, spicy. Sweet start with a tart middle and a dry finish. Mouthfeel is full bodied, smooth and effervescent. A definite warming presence of alcohol. A great beer with a lot of character; complex but not overpowering.
Well-balanced and intense without being over the top.
First Review:
Presentation: 33cl brown bottle with freshness date of 26/08/08
Deep brown color a light brown head with signs of light carbonation. The head diminished to a fine layer quickly leaving a nice band of lace around the glass. Aroma is initially astringent and wine like, but more complex smells and flavors emerge as the beer warms: fruity bubblegum notes, dried fruits and caramel and an earthy background. Flavor is complex and full: sweet fruity and caramel start with a quick tart middle and a lingering tangy hop finish. Mouthfeel is full bodied and syrupy with an alcohol finish and a surprising amount of effervescence. 1,191 charactersSeanChouffe, Aug 14, 2004
4.47/5  rDev 0%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5This bottle had a best by date of 14Jan08. Poured a deep, hazy brown, in my trappist glass, with a small head, which quickly dissipated, leaving a thin, creamy layer, along with moderate carbonation. I left the last 1/2 inch in the bottle, as it contained the majority of the sediment. Smell was warm, doughy bread, with raisins, prunes, alcohol, and a hint of coriander. Marvelous. Medium palate, with a lively carbonation. Flavor was dark fruits, similar to the smell, with a warm, moderately strong, alcohol bite and a mild acidic finish. Great stuff!! I can get more of this; however, at $6.99 for a 33cl bottle, I will limit my intake!! 641 charactersimblane, Aug 05, 2004
4.82/5  rDev +7.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Finally found a 330 ml bottle of this for under $7 (thank you AJs!) and decided it was time to dive in. Allowed the beer a few minutes to warm to recommended drinking temp of 54-58 degrees F before opening.
Despite a careful pour a huge head the color of coffee with cream poured out, three fingers thick, and it wasn't going anywhere. Beer itself is a dark brown-red, reminiscent of cherry-cola. Nice lacing effects.
Aroma is less potent than I suspected it would be. Theres a subtlety here. Hops and candi sugar, maple, and mulled wine come in later, esp. after warming. Theres a lot going on in there, but its almost too subtle. I would have preferred some stronger notes, but I'm nitpicking.
The taste matches the aroma, meaning its wonderfully subtle. The alcohol is the most prominent on the initial sip, but as the beer warms in the mouth strains of plum, dark berry, even brandy come out. 
Mouthfeel is smooth and satiny, despite the level of carbonation. Finishes dry, almost sherry-like. The taste of alcohol lingers a bit on the tongue but its not unpleasant. I see myself warming a glass of this in my hand during the darkest months of the year. 
If the Trappists are as correct about religion as they are beer, we non-Catholics better sign up for Catechism! 1,297 charactersHunter, Jul 17, 2004
4.05/5  rDev -9.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Pours a dark mahogany, topped with a one finger crackling tan head. Lacing was beyond a sheet, it was a wall that fell down the glass above the level of the beer.
Served it at 14 degrees Celsius as directed by the label.
Bread, sugar, flowers, spice aroma. Also peach and tangerine.
Fruity, sweet tasting, a bit of a wheat or hay note. Spicy, floral, tobacco and candy notes.
I'm torn on the drinkability, couldn't drink a lot of it, but it's a sipper I could drink one of this in the same timeframe as 2-3 weaker beers.
Full bodied, tingles the lips. 556 charactersmschofield, Jul 09, 2004
4.72/5  rDev +5.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4330ml bottle. This poured out a cloudy brown color with reddish highlights. It had a decent sized tan head that quickly dropped to a coated of bubbles that left subtle lace around the glass as it was consumed. There was quite a bit of sediment left in the bottle after the pour as well. The aroma smells of malt sweetness, various fruits and a bit of an herbal earthy tone to it. There is also a couple of notes spiciness to the scent and a couple of other smells that were not identified. Leading the way in the taste is a fruity sweetness that is also accompanied by a doughy malt flavor and slight bit of spice. It has a bit of a dry finish and a buttery taste going on as well. Very refreshing to sip on this warm day and no trace of alcohol anywhere. Mouthfeel is rich and about medium to full in body. It goes down very easy and is a very balanced beer. A truly all around excellent beer, highly recommended to anyone. With the many complexities to this I will defiantly be having many more of these in the future. 1,020 charactersmeathookjones, Jun 30, 2004
4.5/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Deep brown with low carbonation and a thin head that leaves quickly.
Complex aroma (in no particular order) - sweet malt, anise, pepper, dark maraschino cherries, chocolate and various other 'unidentifiables'.
Sweet front palate, followed buy a strong spicey alcohol kick that lingers with a little bite for sometime. Boy, does this warm you up! More dark fruit flavours on the palate than the aroma, with a very dominant pepper flavour. Creamy and long, this is impressive.
My only down point is that the alcohol is still a little out of balance. But, I guess thats the price you pay for all that flavour. Cheers to the Belgians! 639 characterskoolk, Jun 15, 2004

Along with 8 other specially imported beers, this was the first I tried
Pours with a dark, viscous body. Thick, heavy sediment lies at the bottom and floats around the glass. Foamy tan head, fizzes and erupts to form an inch to 2inch head.
Smell, rum , raisins and other dried fruit. Strong malty fragrance, flowery aroma and a thick, heady aroma of herbs and fruit.
Taste is phenomenal. Esters of dried fruit, bananas, peaches. Strong malty alcohol kick, but smooth as it could possibly be
As far as belgians this is is unbeatable, a fantastic brew and is one of the best things I have ever tasted, as far as the beers i've tried, this one is perfection in a bottle, a piece of liquid art

4.82/5  rDev +7.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Note: This beer has been aging since August 2003, so any variations of flavor are as a result of its age.
The Rochefort 10 is the stronger brother to the Rochefort 8. It's very similar in appearance and aroma. It's the flavor that sets them apart.
The Rochefort 10 pours a very dark brown with an active head. The tan head rises slowly but forcefully to the top of my glass. I have to wait for it to recede before I finish the pour.
The aoma is quite spicy. I detect the same rum aroma as I did with the Rochefort 8. At forst taste, it seems similar, however, the fruitiness gives way to a distinct alcohol warmth. It is to be expected of a beer that is 11% ABV, however it is incredibly drinkable. Unlike some high alcohol Belgians I have had, this one hides its alcohol better than any I have sampled. It's a stealthy little devil.
All in all, this is a wonderful beer. I would love to end my meal with one. 921 characterskindestcut, Jun 04, 2004
4.87/5  rDev +8.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5rochefort 10 needs no introduction to the seasoned connosieur. it is, to put it simply, one of the very finest brews on the planet across all styles. magnificent in all categories. 
exquisite brown/red/purple like color with a rocky but not too intense head. very easy going fizz happening within. the smell is quite mellow, but complex. rich burnt toffee and chocolate aromas meet up with stone and dried fruits, and a dash of spicy elements also joining in. the taste is just sensational. sweet caramel intensity with plummy, raisiny notes, some apple and pear, a little chocolate, and finishing off with a blast of cinnamon, star anise, cloves and some traces of oak. dryish hop finish pulls everything into order perfectly to finish out what is truly a magnificent drinking epxerience. so incredibly balanced, smooth, strong, but easy to drink. no real trace of the huge ABV, especially if this is the nightcap after a fair session. its beers like this that make those trappist monks the sorts of fellows youd like to have working in your local brewpub.
this is one of those beers that you just have to try before you depart this frail existance. it may not be everyones cup of tea, but good golly, its a champion brew in anyones language. its the most expensive bottle on the shelf by a long way, but worth it to the last drop. a monument to beer and brewing is rochefort 10. 1,386 charactersdiablo14, May 31, 2004

Smells wonderfully fruity with a heavenly yeast background. 
Extremely balanced as it passes the palate. Starts with a bit of plum and apple. Turns grainy and almost rye in it's middle. Finishes with a nice bisquit flavor. Not the most flavorful quad I've had.
Texture is quite evident with that grainy slick mouthfeel predominating. 
Super smooth and drinkable for such a high ABV. Another great belgian sipper. 530 charactersyankeeheel, May 31, 2004

Aroma: Candi sugar, cloves, layers of complexity bombard the senses with some chocolate doughy bread notes, anise, fruit (over ripened fuices flowing). Taste: Awesome slightly tickles the nose with a slow alcohol burn on the first sip, and after that just ease in and enjoy the experience of sampling this fine brew. More cookie dough, yeast cakes, anise, chocolate very dark chocolate, and lucious fruit around the edges herbal hops evident.

3.13/5  rDev -30%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3 | feel: 2.5 |  overall: 3Ok, ok, everyone, spare your critiques and eyebrow raising. I'm also asking myself "what went wrong?" in regards to this beer.
But I don't think just because a beer is "Trappist", or "Top __" I should follow peer pressure and overrate the beer. Because it's a matter of taste, like everything. The date was OK. The pour was ok (in a Rochefort glass even, for the style of it), and the procedure as well. The first glace- small fizzy head, caramelly colour, reminded me of the better memories of beers like 'maudite' or 'trois pistoles' which I so enjoy.
But one whiff to sense the alcohol and yeast started decaying my perception of it. But still, seemed spicy and valid to drink. I went right on, and the overwhelming alcohol, poorly hidden, as well as the excessive, inadequate abundance of sweetness mixed with an oily mouthfeel repulsed me (slightly, not completely), and dropped my judgment immediately. Sad, I held this one til the last minute here in paris, unpurchased, waiting for a good surprise. I'm sticking to Chimay et co. 1,042 charactersAndreji, May 11, 2004
4.38/5  rDev -2%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Pours a deep brown, orange, amber color and makes a thin, yet condensed bubbly white head. Thick lacing down my Chimay goblet. Odor is rich of prunes, raisins, figs, very chocolatey... very nice. Flavor holds true of the boquet, very spicy, pruney, roasted chocolate malts, hint of currant and an alcoholic bite. Mouthfeel is medium to full, warms the pallate as it goes down, leaves a syrupy coat on the throat. This is a very drinkable beer, but like any Trappist should be savored... I think Rochefort 10 would go very nicely with a fine cut of beef. 553 characterskmcnair, May 06, 2004
4.37/5  rDev -2.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Sampled in a red wine glass. The beer initially poured with slight chill haze -- a murky grey brown, that warmed to a brandy-ish color with more clarity. A good sized tan head frothed up but faded quickly to just barely cover the beer.
The aroma was intoxicatingly chocolately. Earthy, musty. Fig. Subtle roasted/toasted grains. Alcohol apparent.
When cold, the carbonation was a bit stinging, but after warming, it was still brisk but brief. The chocolate from the aroma fills the palate as advertised. There are roasted notes and an earthy flavor. It's tremendously rich, smooth, and sweet. No hop presence.
The finish is oily but with a mild dryness. There is a huge amount of warming alcohol throughout. This along with the roasted flavor lends some astringency to counter the sweetness.
This is a highly warming sipper. It's like drinking chocolate except so much better. Not sure why this is a Quadrupel, I would've guessed Belgian Dark Strong. Very delicious. 978 charactersoggg, Apr 30, 2004

It came straight from the fridge, so it was a bit to cold at first. The waitress had an awful pour generating zero head on the beer. I forgave her because she admitted it...she had a whole tray in her other hand. After letting it warm a bit more I poured the remainder of the bottle in and was able to salvage a bit of a head. 
Dark brown, a little cloudy
Sweet pleasant medicinal smell
The first taste was about what I had expected. Very close in mouth feel to the Westy 12 but even sweeter. I found myself wishing for a bit more bitterness about half way through the beer. Bananas...
Raisins...
Currents...
And the beautiful nuttiness of the yeast were all in my mouth.
A beer I would drink after a meal or with a plate of fruit and cheese, definitely not with a meal. 
Great beer, will get it again if Westy is not available. 952 charactersbeefytee, Apr 27, 2004

Pours a mildly cloudy ruby red/brown brew, no head at all probably because of the alcohol content.
Smell is fruity and spicy with the smells of malt, figs, plums, cinnamon, pepper and 20 other things I can't name.
Taste is mildly sweet and flavorful, you can feel the alcohol of this one numb your tongue a bit. Warm fruitiness wraps your tongue in waves of complex sugars and subtle waves fruits. This is a sipping beer that keeps giving you new flavors the whole time you sip it.
Mouthfeel is good.
A pleasure to drink, but at $8 for that one glass bottle not something I can consume often. 671 charactersZorro, Apr 27, 2004
4.42/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Ruby red body is slightly hazy as I am careful about not pouring the yeast dregs in the goblet. The foamy head is about an inch and a half tall after the pour, and sticks around a while, being fed by very fine bubbles from the medium carbonation beneath. Nice lace is evident around the glass. The aroma is deliciously fruity, with plums, cherries, raisins, and licorice notes. The taste is delicately balanced between fruitiness of the malt and spiciness of the yeast. There are also notes of brown sugar on the palette. The mouthfeel is very creamy due to the fineness of the carbonation. It is incredibly smooth and drinkable with almost no hint of the underlying strength. This is a picture perfect mold from which other Belgian Strong Dark Ales are cast. But as usual, the imitations pale when compared to the brilliance of the original. 842 charactersrajendra82, Apr 26, 2004

Pours out dark brown, sits a murky, chocolate colored brown in the glass with a big, light tan head that really sticks to the glass and a good thick skim stays on the beer the whole way down. Awesome.
Smells yeasty, full of breads and malts. Caramel tones along with some diacetyl top it off and produce a very unique, earthy aroma.
Tastes initially sweet with that caramel and butterscotch pulling out in front. Mild alcohol and a slight bitterness finish this off. A nice tasting beer, and the alcohol blends very well inside the other flavors.
A smooth, clean, refreshing body along with some moderate carbonation make this one all around good beer. Easy to drink. Delicious. 761 charactersSkidz, Apr 14, 2004

Aroma is sweet and enticing, of sweet malt, fig, cocoa, and spices. Mouthfeel is full and creamy, a little crisp and dry, leading to rich flavors of malt and plum, rounded out with currant, spices and prune. A bitter aftertaste lingers, followed by an alcoholic tingle. The alcohol lingers long into each successive sip, and detracts from the fine flavors wanting to burst through. An excellent beer, but much seems to be masked. 561 charactersfar333, Apr 13, 2004
4.37/5  rDev -2.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4I picked a real winner for my 20th review!
Appearance: The 10 pours a deep muddy mahogany with an ample khaki head that settles to a ½ finger. Leaves a little patchy lace.
Aroma: Nice! Bready, woodsy, dark fruit sweetness of rum-soaked raisins and plums. Alcohol is clearly evident, but not overpowering.
Taste: Wow. Beautifully complex, the taste begins with bready and woodsy notes. This is followed by a smooth, fruity sweetness that easily melds into a spicy and dry alcoholic finish. The fruit and alcohol notes linger a bit on the tongue, as the alcoholic warming spreads. 
Mouthfeel: The full mouthfeel is tempered a little by the carbonation, leading to more of a medium-full body. Perfect.
Drinkability: High alcohol content makes the drinkability less than it could be, though the alcohol is masked well.
Truly an outstanding beer. Must. Get. More. 
It is because of beers like this that I have been forced to reassess what my favorite style is. I still like my stouts & porters, but damned if the Belgians arent getting the best of me. 1,070 charactersresirob, Apr 07, 2004
4.2/5  rDev -6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Pours to a deep mahogany color with a thick, chunky off-white head. The aroma is malty, fig-like, with a bit of phenols. It has a bit of brown sugar sweetness as well. The flavor starts out sweet and malty, which it then flows to a dark fruit, figgy taste. It then finishes with a dry alcoholic warmth. This is a full-bodied brew that does well masking its strength. A very good beer, definitely better than the 8.

Love the bottle presentation, and then again, its fine foam-sustaining, murky dark brown and mahogany presentation in my glass (operative word: "my"). 
I do not recommend ingesting this one through the nose as I did while attempting to gather in its sublime aroma... much too much a wasted drop. For me, its smell was a "wet," massive particle-attack of sugar and alcohol sweetness. Inviting.
Taste? Well, it's one very powerful beer on the buds; no subtlety here... Candy-sweet with a complex of flavors. Woody-wheat-yeasty-sweet: woody (slight but divine); wheat & yeast (fruity esters); sweet (vinous raisin and alcohol).
Hops are untraceable, as appropriate, and the carbonation superbly cuts through the alcohol, which yet remains present and warning.

Complex is an understatement, this is a very complicated, intriguing and wonderful beer. Drinking this is an experience, not just another quaff.

4.35/5  rDev -2.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4An amazing opaque brown color. The head quickly faded but never really died. The smell is impressive: lots of red fruits, strawberries and raspberries mostly. Unlike other trappists I had, the yeast wasn't noticeable in the smell or in the taste. 
The taste is complex and fruity. Maybe a bit licorish with the high alcohol content. Dark malts. Very thick and even a little bit chewy in the mouth. Some sourness in the aftertaste, hints of lemon, spices abound. A beer for long winter evenings, that warms your whole body. Intense. 
NICE!!! 546 characterstjd25, Mar 25, 2004

The head is small, cream-colored and dies fast. Some extra brownies on yeast pour. The beer is a dark, cloudy brown. Opaque, in fact. Mmm... tangy, sweet creamy nose. Lots of sweet fruit in the front, plus a slight sourish grainsiness. Full, caramel, thick, sweet, creamy middle. Almost chocolatey, but not quite. Some deep fruit in there, carrying through the dry, fresh, bready finish. Alcohol, to be sure. Absolutely wonderful. Awesome.

4.65/5  rDev +4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Had one of these with alexgash. Pours a mysterious murky dark brown, I'm not really sure what to expect here. Light dense Khaki colored head. Rich dark fruit, chocolate and raw malt aromas. Taste is wonderful. Rich chocolatey alcohol flavors mixed with mild dark fruits and an almost roasted quality. You could almost call this a Belgian Imp. stout. Instead of the hops we've got sweet flavorful yeast flavors coming through. Goes down so easy for being 11.3% as to be dangerous. A beer worthy of its praises. 509 characterschaduvel, Mar 18, 2004
4.38/5  rDev -2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Huge creamy tan head atop this cloudy dark mahogany beer. Very sweet smells of raisins, plums and strong malts. Hints of alcohol spices. The taste of plums and raisins hit the palate first, followed by a peppery spice and a warming alcohol feel. Very sweet smooth tastes. The strong old malts finish this beer of quite well and add a bit of complexity. Dries in the aftertaste. In conclusion this is a delicious brew that I wish I could get ahold of more often. 461 charactersstewart124, Mar 15, 2004
4.72/5  rDev +5.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5WOW!. Thats a damn good beer. I poured it into the glass and held it up to the light. It was dark as could be. Took a sniff and knew that it was going to taste great. This beer did not disappoint. I think the Belgian Strong Dark Ales are beginning to edge out the dubbels as my favorite style. I could drink this beer every day (3 or 4 times a day) and never grow tired of it. I believe I will have to run up to Richmond this weekend and find some more! 453 charactersHex92, Mar 12, 2004
4.31/5  rDev -3.6%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5This pours out a molasses color yet settles in the glass barely brown, a very dark black coffee color in the glass with a tremendously large, thick billowing head of dark cream with speckles in it. The top settles and softens to look like melted vanilla ice cream(whipped) and the lacing is one continuing thick curtain around the entire glass with amazing sticking power. One divine looking glass of ale!
Softer then soft nose, nothing to powerful, subtle and soft, appetizing and engaging, ever changing and new; soft fruits of pear, apple, and mango, touches of plum, fig, and raisin, deeper is some spices but light, some cocoa, continues to get more lively as it warms, grabbing light phenolic notes, cookie sugars, and yeast.
Taste is calm and soothing with many hidden subtleties, soft yet kinda darkish bakers chocolate dominates the front and middle with some caramel with a bit of light breadish qualities. Finish is all over the place, as the chocolate wears off a slight appearance of light tropical fruits dash in before reaching the peak of both feel, body, and taste where it mingles with yeasty spicyness, yet some chocolate remains behind drying slightly in the finish, and very late are yet more spices with an little extra burn of good Ol' alcohol, and thats the only place that 11.3% shows itself. And yet it continues, there are many wonderful things that float around once its been there a while including some nice caramel coating the back of the tongue. Nice! As in the smell, there is nothing overpowering, just a bunch of soothing character and subtlety thats just as savory as a really great, chewy homemade cookie.
Feel is super smooth with a very fluffy, almost floating in texture, close to medium yet seeming full body. The texture and body reminds me of the soft graham cracker used for ice cream sandwiches. If you've ever just ate the dimpled brown graham cracker part by itself, this is what I'm talking about. Nice smoothness overall.
Which brings us to its drinkabilty - it has alot of that! Wow, very scrumptious, just thick enough, fluffy, and glides down with astounding ease. Moderate overall really, in my book, was hoping for a bit more and the Rochefort 8 I like just a bit more; still this is very quenchable and wouldn't pass it up for nothing. Price wise it might be? $8 for 11.2 ounces it's almost worth it here. 2,372 characterstavernjef, Mar 08, 2004
4.6/5  rDev +2.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Presentation: Comes in a brown, 33 cl bottle with "Authentic Trappist Product" mark. The bottles says, in French, "Should be consumed before 8/5/08." Poured into a Trappistes Rochefort chalice.
Appearance: Pours a dark, dark brown, almost a stout-like black but for the hint of light. Cola/coffee. Hazier, lighter brown near the top of the glass, with a small head. Weak head retention, but as it fades it leaves tons of dirty lace.
Smell: Smell is dominated by spicy fruit aromas and alcohol esthers. Also strong notes of brown sugars, reminiscent of a brown ale. As it warms, sugar becomes more prominent with a hint of cocoa.
Taste: Nose is immediately spicy with cloves, cinnamon, and pepper, balanced by raisin sweetness. Obvious warming from the huge amount of alcohol. Hops are more pronounced than other Belgians I've tried, and the beer is less dominated by fruit flavors. Yeast contributes to dry, slightly bitter/sour finish with plums, currants (?), and chocolate. Aftertaste has strong notes of alcohol, but not the same raw warmth as the 8; instead, the alcohol is spicy and adds to the flavor. As the beer warms, the aftertaste becomes more herbal and medicinal.
Mouthfeel: Very high level of carbonation initially, but it settles to a nice level. As with all good Trappists, very smooth mouthfeel, although less creamy than something like St. Bernadus Abt 12. Becomes a little syrupy as it warms, which takes away a little.
Drinkability: Obviously the high alcohol content prevents this from being a session beer, but it's an excellent beer to sip and slowly enjoy.
A world apart from the tasty Rochefort 8, with much more complex flavors and higher drinkability. I think that the alcohol is handled much better here: even though it's more evident than the 8, it's also more flavorful and actually adds to the experience of the beer. Rochefort 10 may be the perfect beer to enjoy after dinner; treat it like some good whisky, pause, and relax. 1,977 charactersjed, Feb 27, 2004
4.18/5  rDev -6.5%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Steamy, fuselate nose built on dark fruits and herbs. On the palette, this is on a new plane of gustatorial sensation. I taste every fruit from plums and prunes to pears and apples, all centered around a tower of rich cocoa and caramel. Alcohol fumes from this beer, especially as it warms, lending a seamless depth and spice to the brew with a dry finish. 
Relax, relax.

4.85/5  rDev +8.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5From the earthy nose to the dark reddish-brown colour this beer
is a joy to sit and contemplate. When the first sip is taken the flavours are both strong and bold yet rounded at the edges. It tastes
like the beer has been aged for 2 or 3 years due to the harmonious
meld of hops and malt. You can taste the alcohol but it does not interfere with the sheer pleasure of sipping a glass of this classic. 403 characterscanucklehead, Feb 21, 2004

I feel the earth moving.
The nose is wonderfully beautiful and complex. Caramel, citrus, raisin, other fruit, spices. Everytime I raise the glass, I smell something different.
The taste fruit, caramel, chocolate.
Port-like with a refreshing effervescence. I could drink this beer for the rest of my life -- I wish it were not so expensive and hard to come by here in the Big Easy. 440 charactersdansteino, Feb 18, 2004
3.75/5  rDev -16.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3 |  overall: 3.5My bottle has a drink by 04-03-08 date. Being it is from Europe, I'm not sure if that is April 3 or March 4. Doesn't matter either way, I guess. This one is gone.
It pours a leathery brown color with glints of red. The head needs no coaxing and small thin patches remain in my glass throughout. The first sniff is slightly sour, but that blows off soon enough to reveal an earthy, woody, smoked meat smell that is not entirely unlike red wine.
The taste is not my style. Too much wood in it for me. Certainly complex, but not in a good way in my opinion. I can see it has merits, but I'm not a big fan of what it has.
The mouthfeel is prickly and effervescent, but substantial. Reminds me too much of how soda feels in my mouth.
This is drinkable and there are hundreds of beers that I would turn down to get one of these, but there are so many others that I think are better. 888 characterssilenius, Feb 17, 2004
4.42/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5This unique brew pours a murky brown/leathery color with a big multi-sized bubbly head and lots of sticky and trailing lace.
The initial smell is of a musty basement. A oaky smell emerges as does a whiff of malt, cloves, citrus, apples and alcohol.
The medium/full body has a fresh bread taste. An oaky background supports flavors of citrus, plums, apples, candy sugar, cloves, and peppery spices.
The warming alcohol, while noticeable, is well within the overall balance of aroma and flavor. This is a nice rich Trappist to enjoy by the fire with fine cheeses, dessert, or just as a pleasant nightcap. 605 charactersBeerResearcher, Feb 16, 2004
4.87/5  rDev +8.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5A light brown, off-red hue, with a thick bubble-bath-like head, which acts as a layer throughout the body of this well crafted brew. On the nose, a tinge of alcohol, cotton candy, fruit, fresh flowers. Up front, chewy and a bit sugary, yet now over-dominating. Alcoholic presence off the top, again not too over-powering or distracting. Extremely well balanced and in tact. Everything in this brew appears to be in place, incredible flavorings in the way of bubble gum, cotton candy, plums, cocoa, some spices as it warms, even cloves and orange peel. A decent belly-warmer near the end, with some notes of smokiness, yeast and fresh baked bread. The alcohol effect is incredibly well hidden for the style/ABV, this one is almost addicting, near liquid perfection. 764 charactersGeoffRizzo, Feb 16, 2004
4.62/5  rDev +3.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Thick, creamy, light tan head almost makes it look like a nitro. There's a fair amount of stringy above the chocolatey brown beer. Rich alchoholic plum and raisins, mixed with chocolate bars and apples. I don't know if I've done the aroma any justice, but it's damn good. A mild blend of dark fruits, a bit of caramel, and some followed up my a lightly bitter and alcoholic finish. Silky smooth mouthfeel with a moderately full body. The 11% alcohol barely makes itself known. This is one great beer, just the right mix of flavors and aromas combined with a smooth drinking beer. 579 charactersHappyHourHero, Feb 10, 2004
4.72/5  rDev +5.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4So many flavors, such little amount of beer I have to find them all. That is what I thought about this beer. The complexity was staggering. 11.2 oz was not enough! But I can't afford any more than that. This was a very dark beer for a Belgian and it had a nice, frothy tan head to show its carbonation. Lots of lacing. Smell is strong and has a raisiny, bready flavor to it. Taste is just too complex to describe. It starts out with a tang hit of chocolate and caramel malts. Some floral hops come lightly into the mix. A bready character soon follows. Then fruity sensations run wild. Dark plums and raisins dominating my palate. A rum-like quality is there all along but only increases to epic proportions towards the end. Yeast is quite sour and extremely dry in the finish. This is a beer to savor and sip, very slowly. The only drawback was the price for this. At $10/bottle I can't afford too many of these! 913 charactersgranger10, Jan 20, 2004
4.75/5  rDev +6.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Poured ruby and black into Rochefort goblet. Lots of beige colored flakiness in suspension hovering on the bottom of the goblet. Light brown foam. Lots of dark roasted candi sugar and malt in the nose, coffee and fruit. Taste is complex; smooth, rich and amazing. So many changes in the palate as one sips. Malt sweet and candi raisin and currant, yet maintaining a dryness that is fantastic. I've had this beer a couple of times and it's just really, really good. It's dated 26 08 08 (b.b. Aug 8, 2008), so it's kind of young, but with this beer that's good.

4.72/5  rDev +5.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Bottle had a "best before" date of 05.18.06 on the label. Had a muddy reddish-brown color with a fair amount of suspended yeast clumps and particles, a ¼" lumpy off-white head that quickly dwindled down to a thin ring and left minimal lace.
A couple sniffs and some gentle swirling of the chalice yielded an enticing array of aromas: sweet dark fruits, bready malt, yeast, vanilla, candy sugar, molasses, and alcohol. A taste - mmm, vanilla, candied plums, raisins. Another, larger taste - even more fruit (bananas, this time), almost a pumpernickel bread yeast-laden maltiness, and a finishing alcohol punch and warming sensation to the throat and chest. The feel was medium- to full-bodied, with a light effervescence, and smooth alcohol essence.
Damn, now that was how to start off 2004! Given how long the monks at the Abbaye de Notre-Dame de Saint-Rémy have been brewing this beer, they certainly have got it fine-tuned. Truly a world-class beer. 955 charactersBoilermaker88, Jan 02, 2004
4.82/5  rDev +7.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours very dark opaque, with barely visible hints of red visible in the light. Thick foamy head quickly recedes. The smell of this beer presents so many thoughts, but they all seem to meld together perfectly. The smells are subtle and elusive. Malts are present, with ints of chocolate, various fruits, coffee, and some meaty spices. The taste is very spicy, again almost meaty, with the chocolate hints again, and nutty coffee hints. The heavy carbonation of tiny bubbles gives it a dry mouthfeel which smooths out on the back. Amazingly I thought it was maybe 8% ABV until my brother told me that it was tipping 11%. This says alot for the drinkability of this beer. Simply an amazing beer. 692 charactersFranklinPCombs, Dec 29, 2003

A hint of chocolate as well. Smelled like a serious, alcohol infused banana split.
Very complex flavors. Rich and creamy. Bready malt, banana, tropical and red fruit, mildly tart yeast and a nice subtle bitterness to balance it all. The alcohol was present, but well integrated into the whole.
Lightly sticky and viscous mouthfeel. Rich and full bodied but with a carbonation that makes it velvety and highly drinkable.
Top notch tipple. 625 charactersrkhaze, Dec 26, 2003

4.42/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5This is a lightly hazy deep red - amber color when held up to the light. It is dark amber to brown otherwise. It is topped by a light brown head. Aromas of dark fruit, fruit-cake, and rum. The taste has a lightly spicy yeast character. There is a light sweetness, though this beer is fairly light bodied. Flavor notes of raisin and other dark fruit are under the spicy notes of this beer. The spiciness adds a complexity to this beer that was not in the 6, but I think that the 6 was better integrated than this beer. 517 charactersGueuzedude, Dec 14, 2003

5/5  rDev +11.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured from a 11.2 oz bottle.Maybe it was the goblet, but it appeared a beautiful cherry amber at the bottom, while an almost opaque dark chetnut brown at the top. Generous beige head with a glop of thicker foam in the middle. Nose was of honeydew melon and darker fruit. Exquisite! Mouthful was creamy. 
Taste was incredible. More dark fruits, and a hint of McIntosh apples and melon on top of first rate Belgian malts. What an experience to enjoy! Taste and aroma got even better as the goblet emptied. 
I enjoyed this one much better than the Westy 12. In fact, this Rochefort 10 was the best I've ever had, anywhere, anytime. A sublime experience! Thus my first 5s across the board. Definitely worth the price of admission. Perfection in a bottle! 757 charactersmerlin48, Dec 01, 2003

But the fluffy head was incredible.
Then the best part...the first taste...wow...dark cherries, plums, apricots, bananas, prunes, raisins, all kinds of dark fruits. Some sediment in the beer as well and an amazing lace left on the glass. 
An incredible Belgian even at $ 7.99/btl...absolutely!

4.92/5  rDev +10.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5This is damn near a perfect beer and that is despite its massive ABV. The 10 poured a odd group of colors. Stout black with a foggy white head at first glance. A closer look revealed the top of the glass to be more a brown color with the bottom opaque. Smell was insanely good. A huge bevy of aromas melded so well together. Swirls of licorice, chocolate, dough, a musty "belgianesque" note, and a spicy alcohol finish that tickled the back of my nose. The taste was even more intense if that is possible. Huge notes of alcohol and anise coupled with a bittersweet chocolate upfront with hints of toffee behind cascading into a tart cherry middle, which developed into a almost stout like malt finish without the volumonous mouthfeel. The addition of the yeast subdued the mouthfeel but melded and increased the intesity of all the flavors, especially in the aroma. If this is what being a monk is like(which I know its not) then you can sign me up! 949 charactersGreatPondBrewer, Nov 09, 2003
4.48/5  rDev +0.2%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Don't get much prettier no sir! A black hole of a brew, yet with a very faint, and I mean faint dollop of amber at the bottom of the glass. The head and lace are concrete structures. Aromas are very ripe and fruity, with melon at the forefront. Some botrytis aromas appear as well. The mouthfeel is very enjoyable-at once enveloping the entire mouth with warmth and bursts of barnyard flavors. Flavors are redolent of Blue Cheese-funky, moldy, fruity, yes very much blue cheese esc. I'd bet it would pair like a dream. A sweetness in the way of coffee with heavy cream and sugar adds to the complexity. All in all very wine like in flavor with great depth of flavor. The ever present fruity funkiness will not be for everyone, straight off that is. Yet, this is one that will grow on you for sure. I will re-edit it each time I taste it. Superior Stuff! 853 charactersmoulefrite, Nov 05, 2003

Tasted like dark roasted malts and had quite spectacular ester profile of sweet fruits and real sun dried raisins to go along with a slightly yeasty flavor. The mouthful was thick and creamy with a slightly oily tinge to the tongue. One of the first truly unique beers Ive ever had so many flavors intermingle to tantalize the pallet.

4.3/5  rDev -3.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5This bottle had been lurking in the back of the beer fridge for quite a while - one I had been saving for a special occasion, but the time never seemed right to break out his beer. Finally, some good news justified liberating the beer. Although my happy frame of mind would no doubt contribute to enjoyment of any beer, this was still a tall order to fill - the beer had better be good.
And fill the order it did. Poured a murky cola brown. Aroma and flavors redolent of dark candied fruit - sort of like fig and rice crispy balls from childhood Christmas. Alcohol was there in force, but the flavoring level was not overdone and lent some pepper bite. Quite drinkable for the abv heft. 689 charactersBrent, Oct 07, 2003
4.79/5  rDev +7.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Appearance  The body is very dark brown, cloudy to the extent that no light in my house can put a dent in the color. I controlled the head at the pour, but it was still big and left a filming layer on top of the ale.
Smell  The sugars jump right out of the glass. The generous cane is the first one I caught. This was followed by crumbly brown and sandpaper raw. The heavenly fruits came next. The apricot led the way followed by overripe pears, Bing cherry juice, an orange wedge or two, a little banana, some figs, a piece of star fruit, and finally a quality red apple.
The alcohol notes and mature malt bring up the rear. This is a very complex bouquet.
Taste  Man, is this good. The sweetness comes out in force at the tongue. It seems like a drop of vanilla has been added to give it even more smoothness. I thought the malt might wimp out at the taste, but it stays its ground (an amazing accomplishment).
Mouthfeel  Very lightly carbonated and smooth, smooth, smooth. The alcohol calls attention to itself at some point, but after the first sip or two you just dont care.
Drinkability  This defines creamy Belgian Ale. Its just beautiful to hold in the mouth and the flavors will keep you busy all night long. What a treat. 
Update  I have this occasionally and decided to re-review for 2004. I was able to pick up some tobacco at the nose to go along with all of the wonderful fruits. It seemed a little more boozy though then I remember so I shaved a half point off of the MF. 1,524 charactersRoyalT, Oct 07, 2003
5/5  rDev +11.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Served in the 11.2 oz. bottle. The color is a dark amber, with a bubbly, creamy white head. The smell is malty sweet, and also smells of alcohol. The taste is quite sweet, with hints of nut and raisins, with a malty aftertaste; the alcohol is clearly present, but rather than detracting from the beer, it adds to the relaxing, warming sensation of the beer. Mouthfeel is as creamy as possible. Drinkability-wise, despite the over 11% ABV, I would certainly enjoy drinking as many of these as I could afford!!
When everyone speaks of Trappists, they talk about Westvleteren, and rightly so. However, Rochefort is every bit as good, and I think I enjoyed it even more!. A very underrated beer, and definitely a new favorite on my list!! 737 charactersbeergeek279, Sep 27, 2003

The aroma is cinnomeny, sweet and fruity all rolled into one, cant quite put my finger on it. The taste is very very sweet, like many strong ales out there, btu more malty and sweeter, also very little hops, and the alcohol makes itself known.
Looks much like a coca-cola when poured into a glass. This isn't a candid camera stunt, is it? It is dark brown, with a brown, head that starts fizzy but turns almost creamy and it maintains itself forever. Ahh, the initial aroma; this is no soda. There are the earthy-yeast notes that seem to be evident in any well made triple, along with candy apple. I am surprised that this ale's strength is not noticeable.
This brew tastes initially like a traditional english nut brown ale with hints of malt, but then overwhelms with sweetness. As it warms, notes of fruitiness and malt become more prominent and the sweetness takes on a whole new life.
The alcohol warming is prominent. 1,023 charactersIanhockey91, Sep 19, 2003

4.24/5  rDev -5.1%look: 5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Dark brown with dried blood highlights, near opaque. The off-white head is massively fluffy, solid as a rock, excellent retention lots of unorganized lace. Eye candy in my goblet! Mellow nose bubblegum esters, ripe bananas, light spice/pepper, alcohol. It is inviting but not that potent. Very tasty palate with loads of alcohol spiciness (upfront) that sizzles the tongue a pleasant pain! Peppery, lightly funky-medicinal the amount of bitterness is great. The maltiness is not as pronounced as I though it should be, lightly sweet like candied sugar. Exotic fruitiness. There are plenty of subtle complexities so delicious to drink! Medium body, firm carbonation yet the mouthfeel is slightly creamy. Long finish, more-ish aftertaste. This one is great and I wish I had more. Very Recommended! 811 charactersbditty187, Sep 11, 2003

Fruity nose, banana and raisins mostly...slightly alcohol too. It smells really nice. The taste is fresh and fruity, mosltly I sense raisins and esters. It combines both sweet and sour tastes, with a slight bitter aftertaste, of course it also tastes a bit of alcohol but I don't really mind that.
The mouthfeel is really good, it's silky smooth and perfectly carbonated. However whopping in at this high abv. it might not be the most drinkable of them all. 526 charactersRocko, Aug 22, 2003

I hope this was just a bad bottle, but at 7 bones a pop I won't be giving it a retry any time soon. It looked nice, it smelled nice, but it tasted like cough medicine served in an ashtray after you just brushed your teeth. The beer did get better as it warmed, and the alcohol did make it a bit more palatable, but all in all I think it was a bad beer. After trying all the great Unibroue beers this one fell far short. 517 charactersSixpack595, Aug 20, 2003
5/5  rDev +11.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5(330 ml bottle). Pours with an enormous and thick light tan head, beer is cloudy, very dark brown colour. Heavenly complex aroma: oak, port wine, dried fruit and spices. 5.0 points for aroma/smell is not enough! Flavour is complex, spicy and oaky - toffee sweetness is well balanced with hops. Warming mouthfeel, otherwise the high ABV is well hidden. Long lasting aftertaste. Can't find any faults with the beer - therefore a straight 5.0. Does that imply that any "perfect" beer has to be as strong as Rochefort 10? Certainly not - but in the strong division, this one is in the lead, at least untill I have sampled Westvleteren... (But the price in Norway is outrageous: USD 9 for a small bottle - in the store!) 715 charactersSigmund, Aug 14, 2003

The aroma was very fruity and malty. Very pleasant. Much like the Rochefort 8, this was a good beer. The alcohol is much more apparent in this one as opposed to the Rochefort 8, so I have to say that I think the 8 is a little more smooth and easy to drink. The flavor represented the aroma well - fruity, malty, and laced with alcohol. Another great Belgian beer. 453 charactersclvand0, Aug 14, 2003

Head is creamy tan and very tight settling down to about a quarter inch and resting there. Aroma is a complex one. Very fruity and raisin like aromas, alcohol also present. A bit earthy as well. A rich strongly flavored beer which is fruity and malty with a good kick. Has a very smooth and delicate mouthfeel with just a bit of a bite to it near the finish. Nice warming effect creeps up on you. An exceptional ale. 543 charactersBierReise, Aug 05, 2003

It pours a dark brown color with 3 thick fingers of dense, rocky, light tan foam. The head stays along for the ride the entire time, and there is lots and lots of lace left on the glass. The smell is rich in chocolate and raisins, with a little hint of alcohol. Not really as big of a smell as I was expecting. The taste is fairly malty with raisins and plums coming right out. There is some hops and alcohol to the finish. The mouthfeel is strong, yet this is a super smooth brew. The drinkability is pretty good for being 11.3% abv. Yet another fine Belgian! 608 charactersSheepNutz, Jul 25, 2003

Aroma reminiscent of the best things about New England Brown Bread: raisin sweet mixed with sweet dark bready notes. Just enough alcohol and phenol in the nose to say "I'm going to be a monster."
And then: hey! Not overly carbonated or aggressive in flavor. More gentle in its maltiness and hoppiness than I would have expected, bringing the drinkability and mouthfeel ratings way up for the style and the alcohol content. A rich cake flavor with notes of molasses, chocolate, raisin, dried apple and floral hops. Not sugary sweet; some spice notes in the finish. Would love to have aged it some, but I'll start with a raw review and go from there. 821 charactersecoboy, Jul 17, 2003

There were carbonation bubbles coming up from the bottom. Lace is minimal. The aroma is mainly of sugar and fruit. The taste is malty and creamy. It is very sweet and complex in flavor. I really like the flavor of this beer, but I cant pull out any distinctive tastes. Medium bodied beer that leaves you craving for another. 391 charactersAmdahl, Jun 27, 2003

Nose is very spirity (rum/whisky) over substantial sweet raisiny malt. It shows a bit more fruitiness with time, and a touch of yeastiness, but its not particularly complex or pleasant.
Very rich in the mouth, pushing the limit of acceptable sweetness for me. Its quite fruity, and there is a ton of rich bready malt. Some yeastiness as well. The tiny, constant streams of fine carbonation rising throughout the pint keep it from being ponderous. The alcohol is a readily apparent, and not particularly pleasant, component of the palate. 667 charactersRealale, Jun 23, 2003

Taste is extraordinary; complex and layered, which keeps the alcohol from taking over. Hints of fig and raisin with a sugary overtone that's quite pleasing. Malt and a bit of hop were also evident. Simply superb. Easily one of the best things I have ever tasted. Will return again and again.. 396 characterseuskera, Jun 22, 2003

Its receeding head left a most excellent lacing and was very long lastibng. It has a strong caramel malt aroma with a complex flavor of roasted malt, spivces and caramel notes. The alcohol content was noticeable, but still well hidden. What a most excellent treat for Father's Day! We also had a Westvleteren 12 on the side for comparison. The results were:
Appearance: Westy

I just could not acquire a taste for this brew as I was hoping to. That said, it poured a large invigorating tan head with fine-small bubbles into my glass. The lacing was good on all sides of my glass. It had a sweet aroma to it and a cloudy brown body. There was carbonation observed with this brew. It kept leaving me with a tingly, burning sensation in my throat that was not to my liking. Give me a Westy 12 anyday!! 533 charactershotstuff, Jun 15, 2003

This one pours a dark ruby color with a sturdy beige head that laces extremely well. A sweet chocolate aroma presents itself, as notes of nuts and yeast are subdued but present nevertheless. Taste is sweet, nutty, yeasty, alcoholic, and overall delicious. Mouthfeel is smooth and this beer is very well balanced. For a beer of its ABV, this one drinks way too easily and can put one on his ass if he is not careful. Certainly a classic, and well worth its acclaim. 509 charactersJon, Jun 14, 2003
4.7/5  rDev +5.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Dark brown with a huge foamy head. Very appetizing.
The taste was big and malty. The beer started dry with earthy and spicey notes (nutmeg, pepper & cinnamon) and then became more complex and flavorful with hints of chocolate, molasses, brown sugar and maybe even some plum & fig notes to it. I liken it to a big Tootsie-Roll in a bottle.
A very warm beer both in appearance and in taste. Complex. More refined and mature than Rochefort 8.
This was a great drinking experience. A true classic of the beer world! 520 charactersPopsinc, Jun 12, 2003

Poured it into a fluted glass and got about half an inch of head that went away quickly. Some floaties. Very dark color. The smell is strong(to go with the alcohol). Banana, plum, cocoa, medicine all present in nose. The alcohol is not real prominent, surprisingly. Only a little warm going down. I would recommend the 52-58F serving temp stated on the bottle. Only a little carbonated bite. Really wonderful mouth feel. Fruit, malt, fig or plum. You can wait for several minutes between sips, the taste sticks around!! There are very few beers that even come close to this quality and enjoyment. Price is the only hold back ~$6. Worth it for a special treat 699 charactersdaledeee, May 25, 2003

The head foams up a bit fluffy off-white and looks like a layer of pudding sitting on top of the beer. The head dimishes a bit but sticks around to the end, leaving lace all the way down the glass. It's a beautiful, deep ruby. The smell is ripe fruit, most notably raisin and cherry, and a bit of spice. Ripe fruit and peppery flavors come through with just a hint of licorice. The mouthfeel is a creamy miracle. This is the ultimate sipping beer and a must for a special occasion. 615 charactersmickeymac, May 14, 2003

This ale poured (carefully) a cloudy, dark coffee brown with highlights of red, with thin tan foam that dissipated rapidly. The smell was vinous and fruity (figs, apples), with caramel, sweet malt, and oak thrown in. There was also an alcohol odor discernible, though not strong. The taste was mildly sweet, vinous and fruity (apples, grapes, figs, raisins), with malt and alcohol flavors. The flavors blended wonderfully to give a very mellow experience. The mouthfeel was very smooth and velvety, with medium-full body and low carbonation. The flavors lingered in the mouth. The drinkability was very good. A very nice strong Belgian ale. 714 charactersUncleJimbo, May 08, 2003
3.95/5  rDev -11.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4A nice dark brown pour with some amber notes. A pillow of tan foam sat on top, and did not move even after I was finished. A massive aroma of cherries, dark malts, coffee, caramel, and alcohol. It is all blended to near perfection. 
This is a huge beer. The flavor is all over the place with lots of complexity. A little sweet fruitiness is followed by a good smooth flow of dark malts. The flavor starts to get roasty towards the end, and then you get a big blast of alcohol. Sometimes the alcohol was hidden, and if it was like that throughout, this beer would have scored much higher. I tasted a whole lot of alcohol through most of this beer. It was not welcomed in that quantity. Besides that, this is an excellent beer. It is everything you would want from a belgian dark ale. Full bodied, with a great aroma and masses of flavor. The alcohol warms nicely, but the flavor of alcohol needs to be toned down. 915 charactersElGuapo, May 04, 2003

What an amazing beer! I decided to celebrate my 250th review of a Rochefort 8 yesterday by cracking open this marvellous bottle of Rochefort 10. I have to say: of all of the Trappist breweries Rochefort is really trying hard to become my favorite one. The verdict is still up in the air though as I do love all of the Westvleteren and Chimay beers as well! This beer poured a very syrupy dark brown colour that was very reminiscent of the 6 and the 8. This beer was a bit darker though and it did also have a very large fluffy, off-white head as well. The aromas were of subdued alcohol, dark malts, breads, spices, belgian sugars, yeast and hops. Excellent aromas. The taste of this beer was wonderful. The more subdued flavor notes melded nicely with the very hearty dark malt and spice flavors. The mouthfeel was incredibly syrupy and thick and the drinkability was very good, especially for a beer weighing in at over 11% ABV!
Truly, one of the all-time greats!
Cheers to all BA's...I raise this glass to you (again) !
Cheers!

4.65/5  rDev +4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Ahh...Rochefort 10...I've been looking forward to this!
Appearance: Pours an incredibly dark mahogany with minimal clarity. It's tan head starts out thick and creamy, and dwindles down to a small cap. Good lacing on the glass.
Smell: Wonderful aroma that comes across as nutty and vinous. Lots of dark fruits, port, and alcohol blend together well. There's a bready note, but it's faint. I pick up on a touch of spiciness, as well as a slight phenolic note.
Taste: Bitter-sweet with an explosion of dark fruits. The nuttiness hangs in the forefront. There's a nice toffee/butterscotch flavor that sits just under the surface. The same phenolic touch that was in the nose plays in the background. Very complex and warming. There's a nice rush of alcohol on the tail end that reminds you that it's not to be hurried. Adding the yeast ups the spiciness a bit, as well as adds even more of a bready flavor. This brew tastes 'darker' than the Westy 8 I recently enjoyed...
Mouthfeel: Lush and creamy with a full mouthfeel. Adding the yeast sediment at the bottom of the bottle only enhances that feel. Very warming with an alcohol-tinged finish.
Drinkability: Scary for the amount of alcohol this brew has. It packs a wallop, yet hides it until the end. I could drink several of these...slowly of course! 1,314 charactersMJR, Apr 19, 2003
4.85/5  rDev +8.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured a slightly red deep brown color with a creamy head that stayed thin after it fell. Nose was a pear/apple smell, wine grapes, spicy alcohol, and that medicinal tone that dark & heavy belgian brews give off. It also smelled of a slight floral tone, but much softer and refreshing than most hop-type of floral scents. 
Flavor was tastily chewy with savory malts, peppery, and had an earthy body that had notes of smoked cedar. (like BBQ kinda thing). Also had a little fruity taste, like a slight pear flavor on the tip of my tongue. Very smooth through out, it had an interesting creamy taste in the finish, and to boot an aftertaste of dark candy-sugar hiding in the nooks of my mouth. No taste of the alcohol but youll feel it. The mouthfeel was soft and viscuous  not watery, not oily, but something great in between. 
This beer is so easy to go back to, as it makes you content in its taste and feeling. Easily a beer to have often, if you can afford it. So simple, not in a minimalist way but in a straightforward way. Outstanding tradition and elegant simplicity - what a dark malty brew can be at its best. 1,128 charactersnomad, Mar 31, 2003

Aroma is of burnt malt, plum, sugar, and alcohol. I was actually a bit underwhelmed by the aroma. After sniffing the 8, I expected something even bigger from the 10. It would have been a nice warning of what to expect in terms of flavor! Once again, the alcohol is quite noticeable from the first sip. And thenwell, theres a *lot* going on. Bready body, tastes of molasses, pepper, raisin and plum, pear and banana, all undergirded by a solid chocolate/caramel maltiness. Finishes with a strong hit of leafy hop flavor. Thinner in body than I had expected, but still creamy and viscous in mouthfeel. Not to be trifled with! 729 charactersmzwolinski, Mar 27, 2003

The nose is a heady mix of dark fruits, chocolate, malts and alcohol. Taste is a wonderful mix of candi sugar, yeasty fruitiness, hops, chocolate...and a massive alcoholic presence that just coats the throat as you swallow this complex ale. Finishes with a complexity rarely tasted in most ales of any style, with a chocolatey sweetness that gives way to a very appetizing dryness that begs another long sip...one of Belgium's (and the world's) finest beers, one of the all-time greats!

4.26/5  rDev -4.7%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Murky burnt sienna capped with a staggering beige foam. An archetype of appearance.
Aromas of hay, alcohol, burnt sugar, pepper, and trout streams.
Taste focuses on the subtle rather than the 11%+ thrashing that is in store. Pepper and caramel initially, which segue smoothly into the fruit isle at the local mega-grocery store. The shopping basket fills with anise, prunes, star fruit, kiwi, lime, and pineapple. Underlying this all is a scorched sugar base. Yeast adds some sour spiciness. Alcoholic bitterness towards the finale, with is offset by a subdued floral hopping.
A bit fizzy right away, but settles to a substanciated heft within the mouth.
Way too drinkable for something this strong. 703 characterscokes, Mar 01, 2003

As expected extremely complex and smooth with a creamy sherry like flavor and sharp peppery alcohol warmth with a very rounded full mouthfeel. Definitely a delicious smooth beer more akin to a sherry or port and intended to be savored in a similar manner. Would be welcome anytime but possibly best suited as an after dinner drink.

I really can't think of any flaws in this brew. I guess the only draw back is the high price of $8+ a bottle. As soon as I opened the bottle, I noticed the vanilla and fruits scent in it. One thing that "turned me on" was the sight of the beautiful dark color and a creamy brown head. The head was supper thick at first, but subsided into a film-like substance. The taste was of heavy vanilla, fruit, nuts, and a hint of alcohol taste. The nutty vanilla taste stays around for a while after you swallow and leaves a little tinge on the tounge. I really like this brew and put it up there with the Weste 12. If you have it in your area, give it a go, it's well worth the price. 781 charactersJISurfer, Feb 17, 2003

I have made a note to myself to definitely get some more of this very tasty and delicious Belgian ale. The higher alcohol in this gives it a very nice warming finish.

The initial sensation to me after my first taste was "warming". The alcohol is not overly powerful in the taste at all. What is powerful in the taste is pears and dried fruits. I didn't notice much of a chocolate taste like many reviewers have mentioned. I just can't believe how smooth this beer is for the amount of alcohol in it. This is the finest Belgian beer I have had yet. I definitely like it more than Maudite, La Fin Du Monde, and Trois Pistoles; these being the only other Belgian ales I have tried. It tastes so good, that it's hard to drink it slow which is a good idea unless you want to be overwhelmed with a quick inebriation. 826 charactersAudioGilz, Jan 27, 2003

Very loose sediment, even after sitting still in the fridge and being gently poured leaving a little in the bottle, I was disapointed to get a shot of sludge into my glass that muddied it all up. Will remember to leave about 3 oz in the bottle next time, which is a lot of a not-so-cheap beer. No head. May update if the next bottle I try pours better.
Disapointing aroma. Very high, but clean, alcohol. With low, but nice aroma of chocolate covered cherries. The low aroma is very disapointing.
Flavor is also very simple. Nice dryness for a such big beer, which I really like in a Belgian. A bit hot still, needs to age a bit more, need to nunt down some older bottle, because I cant see wasting celar space on this beer. Smoky flavor, some nice phenolic spicyness, but low. Not a lot of malt, this beer must have a healthy sugar dose. Some fruityness, but not real high for a belgian.
One of the more drinkable big beers I have had, but definitly not one of the more interesting. I can see this making a great aged beer...but I dont see it as one of the top beers in the world. Who knows, maybe an aged bottle would change my mind. 1,404 charactersnathi, Jan 23, 2003
4.47/5  rDev 0%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5This is a big, powerful, and elegant Belgian beer. It pours a dark, leathery brown with a nice head. The aroma is heavy with fig and molasses notes. Very aromatic.
The flavor is lush and full-bodied, remeniscent of liquor-soaked figs, dark rum, licorice, and hints of chocolate. There's a smooth, coating mouthfeel. Spicy, warming, peppery alcohol notes carry throughout the nose and mouth, particularly after the beer warms. The high alcohol content is a key component of this beer.
This beer is very complex and wonderfully balanced, with layers of flavor that reveal themselves as the beer warms in the glass. It really is a delicacy, and at $8.00 per bottle it's one that I will indulge in very infrequently. 718 charactersDerKaiser, Jan 13, 2003
4.5/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5This beer was a high alchohol content for my normal taste but you really only get the good parts of that warm feeling, no overpowering perception of alchohol. Don't be afraid if your don't drink this style of beer or beer's with such high ABV.
I did swirl sediment into poor.
Appearence: dark cider with a nice toffe colored fluffy head that disipates somewhat fast leaving a nice lace on top of beer but a clean glass.
Smell: sweet of malty dried fruits, hint of alchohol
Taste: Got better with each sip as temp rises opening more flavors. Currants, dried fruits and rum with a slight caramel/toffe maltiness. 
Mouthfeel: Very fine carbonation expand in your mouth like a mouse, very rich and very smooth for alchohol content.
Drinkabilty: great, its not part of a six pack it's meant to be savored slowely. You will also feel the warmth in your belly and your head letting you know not to rush and/or start to slur your words.
Overall this beer was excellent . 983 charactersOatmattStout, Jan 08, 2003

The grass like aroma lets me know to expect a strong brew. Buttery, toffee flavor rides the malty goodness and with a hint of wood it gives a full mouthfeel. The 11.3% is there from begining to end but not over powering. 339 characterspaceyourself, Jan 01, 2003

A absolute treat, one of the true greats,has the perfect blend of malt and bitterness.Tastes of fruit and spice. Alcohol not that noticable in taste, but definitely in effect! Two of these, and it will be sleepy time! I had this after a St. Bernardus 12, and I definitely prefered the Rochefort. Overall, this is a unique and incredible beer! This one poured a very large, foamy head which took a while to settle. Sweet and complex, a wonderful brew.Smooth, creamy, and as close to perfect as a beer can be. 532 charactersJohnnyDuvel, Dec 30, 2002
4.62/5  rDev +3.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Beer tasted in a parallel comparison with Westvleteren 12.
The colour is dark brown, with a tan head.
Smell toasted, alcoholic, with notes of fruit (sour black cherry). At the taste the alcohol seems to attenuate (relatively). Notes of pear, roots, with a little asperity. The finish is dry and astringent.
Anyway it has a net start, well resoluted. 352 charactersstcules, Dec 29, 2002
4.3/5  rDev -3.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5OK, part 3 of my Trappistes Rochefort adventures.... #10 has an enticing ruby-chestnut color; head jumps out to a rocky, foamy lead, before settling back into the pack as a thin, tan layer. Not a whole lot of lacing to speak of, though. Also, I might add that there are some yeasty (naughty?) bits looking for something to do while floating around in the bier. Rich, dark fruit aromas abound, along with malty sweet notes. Medium body, and a pleasant feel on the tongue mean one thing: a good overall mouthfeel! Number 10 has a good little punch behind it, and the alcohol is somewhat evident whilst tasting! It has a rich, malty flavor, along with a plethora of dark fruit, like figs and currants. This is nice! I have tasted #'s 6, 8 and then 10, in that order, with increasing enjoyment down the line. Is there a #12 out there?

4.48/5  rDev +0.2%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Brown bottle with no label or freshness date, only the cap denotes the type of Rochefort it is. 
Appearance: Maximum stickage as the head leaves a dreamy looking lace as well as a pancake of head in the middle of the glass. Bold brown hue with bright ruby highlights, warm looking.
Smell: Dark sugars, perhaps a thick dark brown sugar, some herbal phenolics that are soft and hints of liquorice and cocoa in the nose as well.
Taste: Medicinal, peppery and warming. Thick maltiness with hints of light grade molasses and dark bread. Phenolics are soft but are dug in deep into the taste buds. Hops are mild and weathered with a leafy character. Faint detection of caramelized sugar and a ghost like smokiness. Esters are there but very mellow. It takes a while to take notice the strength of the alcohol as it warms the body. 
Mouthfeel: Heavenly smooth and oh so creamy, solid medium to full body. Care has been taken to bring forth such a lush mouth feel.
Drinkability & Notes: Definitely a sip and savour brew and better to pair up with some different cheeses. I opted for a meat and cheese plate and it play well with this tall standing brew. 1,160 charactersJason, Dec 19, 2002

Tha aroma is dried fruits with alcohol and background floral notes. The taste starts off with a rich malty flavor that is well balanced with flavors of dried cherries and plums. The finish is very flowery and dry with alcohol and apple/pear being the dominant flavors. The aftertaste is alcohol warmth lingering with malty sweetness and faint notes of raisin. The mouthfeel is smooth and silky with just the right amount of carbonation. This is one of the worlds greatest beers. Smooth, easy to drink, and one of the most complex of the Trappist beers. If you get the chance to try one of these, do it at any cost. 736 characterspurplehops, Dec 14, 2002

An aroma of malt, plum, raisins and spice. A flavor of malt and spice with some fruit element plus you can detect the presence of the alcohol and it's warming effect comes through in a tart finish that hints at heavy carbonation being present. This is by far the best of the three of theirs that I have tried. Thanks again to the Ohio lawmakers for letting us get this. 467 charactersWildman, Dec 04, 2002

Flavor is very heavily dominated by the alcohol, with some fruity flavors and a touch of chocolate coming through. Sweet and tart, but not at all cloying or overstated. Mouthfeel is light to medium with a lot of effervescence... this beer is just loaded with carbonation, and fills the mouth like a champagne. This is a very good, and unique brew... not quite the pinnacle of beer excellence, but definatley a very good beer. 586 characterszerk, Nov 26, 2002

It is possible that it wasn't as fresh as it could have been because it didn't have any lasting head or lace to speak of.  The appearance was a bit hazy.  My homebrew dubbel looks better...  The flavor was very complex, though.  I don't have much experience in describing beers, but the words sweet, sour, and alcoholic come to mind.  Rochefort 10 is a good treat once in a while.  It must be drunk nearly at room temperature to experience everything that's going on in this brew.  Served cold, it has a nasty bite, as do most of the Belgian and/or dark ales I've tried.  The mouthfeel after swallowing this beer reminded me of whiskey or even a strong wine.  Something keeps me coming back to Rochefort, although there are many others I haven't tried yet. 823 charactersJasonStrauss, Oct 13, 2002
4.87/5  rDev +8.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5From the very start this Beer simply oozes Class. A brown 33cl (12 fl.oz) Bottle, that long before the days when paper was applied, was known only as "Noire" - indeed, it still is by some die-hards. A cream-colored label now simply pronounces the contents as Trappistes Rochefort Biere 10 Bier, in a sort of a cross between an Olde English and Old Germanic Font. Its understated packaging is quite fitting; no hard-sell is needed, for this beer does its talking once poured.
Into the correct Glass (a must!), it has a darkish, deep brown hazy appearance, that when held up to my desk lamp refracts the artificial light with a deep ruby red glow. Massive carbonation at first gives an authoritative head that slowly settles. Streams of small bubbles race feverishly to join the underside of the brown head.
Take Care all who Enter here..
The aroma pulls no punches, and proudly pronounces the beers strength without any ambiguity. A very powerful alcoholic, vinous, malty-mouthfeel, with a somewhat fruity middle. The fruit is perceptible in the aroma, especially as the beer reaches room temperature, I always get Bananas. Strong dark chocolate liqueur tastes fused with hints of Dundee Cake. It slowly warms the lining of the throat as it descends, and leaves a long fantastic warming finish that releases yet further tastes - this beer never ends it seems. I wish it wouldnt. A perfectly balanced Strong Dark Belgium Trappist Ale that must not be served cold (below 54 F). The Bottle cost me $7.95, and it was worth every Cent, possibly more. A Majestic, Aristocratic, Legendary Trappist Ale made from the Highest Quality Ingredients by Craftsmen. To be treated with Respect, Reverence, and a Realization that, you WILL want to drink it again. An Old Master of the Beer World.
NOT for Atheists!!!. 1,811 charactersTheLongBeachBum, Oct 10, 2002
4.13/5  rDev -7.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Hazy dark brown hue, topped by a thick, well retained very dense tan head.  Dense, heterogenous lace is left down the glass.  Bubblegum esters and mellow chocolate dominate the aroma, but tart fruit, yeast mustiness and whiffs of peppery alcohol add complexity.  Flavorwise, banana esters and assertive malt sweetness are perceptible initially, then are promptly ensued by deeply caramelized fruit notes reminescent of sugary prunes and dates. A combination of raisiny Special B and chocolate malt surfaces late, complementing the caramelized dark fruit flavors.  Hop bitterness is virtually absent and would be out of place in this malt driven brew.  Lightly bodied and agreeable in mouthfeel considering the strength-- the copious use of dark candi sugar is quite evident.  Finishes w/ bready malt notes and darts of spicy alcohol on the tongue.  Satisfying alcohol warmth grows progressively stronger and eventually coats the throat.  Rochefort 10 is certainly a delicious brew, but seems to lack the depth and drinkability of the "lighter" Rochefort 8.  It's intense and tasty, nevertheless. 1,095 charactersmarc77, Sep 15, 2002

Extremely fruity with notes of  pears and bananas, as well as a big chunk of fresh bubblegum. The body is light/medium and it has a somewhat zesty mothfeel.The flavor is expansive with a silky, fruity maltiness that fills the mouth revealing a faintly milk-chocolate character just before a charge of hops coats the throat. The alcohol is noticeable but not obtrusive. The distinctively chocolatey flavor also comes through in a late, warming finish - accompanied by some vanilla, fruit and bready notes. An astonishingly complex beer that cannot be done justice with just words. 664 charactersNeroFiddled, Aug 11, 2002
4.73/5  rDev +5.8%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I will compare this beer to Westvleteren 12 because they are similar beers. Rochefort is darker and more opaque. The head is a darker khaki. The head composition is unusual. The bottom is big bubbled but the bubbles get smaller the closer to the top until the top layer you can't see the individual bubbles and you just get a creamy foam. Because of the different bubble sizes you get a less creamy mouthfeel , but one where the feel of the bubbles plays a part. The aroma is that of a good porter with some spice and fruitiness. The flavor has a nice toffee maltiness with pears, chocolate and a dessert spice like cinnamon or nutmeg. It also has a brightness to the flavor that the Westy lacked. Like the Westy, surprisingly easy to drink for its strength. 758 charactersaracauna, Aug 10, 2002

The head is thick, luscious, creamy and tan. This beer has a beautiful aroma. Dark fruits, dark malt and cotton candy all in the mix. And sweet cookie dough. Now this is a beer to savor. Beautiful taste as it hits the tongue. Sweet fruits meld in perfection with dark (slightly burnt?) malts and of course sugars (seemingly brown and dark candy). Barely a hint of alcohol. (And this is 11.5 a/v?) So damn smooth. And damn tasty to boot. One of the best Belgian beers I've ever had. 577 charactersBighuge, Jul 11, 2002

4.65/5  rDev +4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Deep chestnut brown, head settles in 25 seconds or so. Small bubbles but not fizzy. Aroma is just a touch vinous, nice rum and raisin notes, yeastiness is distinct and fresh flowery. Dense smoky raisin flavors, slightly like the smell but more restrained. Nice balance, not overly champagne-like or super sticky brandy. Finishes with a satisfying alcohol warming and coating property. Flavor impact like a see-saw, powerful at the beginning and end. There are some Belgian brews that rub me the wrong way (and many that don't), this hallowed "cough syrup" is not only an excellent example of a dark artisinal ale but a great tasting beer. Coated the wine goblet I used really nicely. 683 charactersADR, Apr 16, 2002

Appearance: Dark, deep, rich rustic brown with a creamy tan tight lace, which is semi-sticky.
Smell: Spicy alcohol, ripe fruit (raisin & plum) and sweet ripe tropical melon aromas.
Taste: Upfront is an immediate prickly alcohol that rides upon a layer of tingly carbonation, making it smooth. Alcohol is extremely warming on the palate, throat and face. The malt is big, sweet & fruity, like ripe plum that melds with a spiciness that brings English Christmas Pudding drizzled with rum to mind. Some spicy pepper notes (from the yeast), some sweet sugary peppermint, almost medicinal to a certian point. Did we mention that this beer is alcoholic?
Notes: Beer like this gives us a reason to live. 980 charactersBeerAdvocate, Nov 06, 2000
