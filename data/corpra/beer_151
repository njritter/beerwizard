4.23/5  rDev -5.2%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25Bottle no apparent date:
Poured straight down the middle of the glass, there was a scant showing of tan head.  Not long lasting, there is a thin ring around the glass.  Some parts stick to the glass as I tip it, but there is no lacing as the bubbles make their way back to the beer itself.
Nose had me going one of two ways initially - I get a nice roasted malt base which is good for a stout.  However, the barrel aging gives it a hint of tartness that I've noticed in infected beers.  I am sure this isn't infected, so when I think about the notes I might get from the barrel, it seems fine.  That impression also mostly faded by mid-glass.  There is a sweet apple note, but also a little tartness that almost seems a little plum-like.  Chocolate, roasted malt, fireplace char all get a little say in the nose.
Right up front, the apple hits - not strong, but just the first distinct note I get.  It's more apple juice than brandy initially.  Getting the beer to the back of the palate brings out the chocolate/vanilla, cocoa notes of the stout.  A nice little warming occurs as the brandy flavor and 12% of this beer begin being sensed.  The sweetness is tolerable to this point, but that tolerance is tested a tad as the ending stays pretty sweet.  The last notes are finally a little bit of char, but also a little cherry cordial sorta flavor.
This beer is quite slick and smooth, medium heavy feel, and full bodied.  Obviously not dry at all, given the sweetness that lasts the whole taste.
I really liked my first few sips.  The sweetness built up, however, and my feelings were tempered.  It never became a chore to drink, and I think it would work great as an after dinner sipper, maybe even to share. 1,714 characterscjgiant, Apr 23, 2017

4.15/5  rDev -7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4Very little head, and it isn't as dark/opaque of a stout as I thought it'd be. Big brandy notes come through on the nose and palate. The base beer has a big chocolate malt quality. Combined with the apple brandy, it smelled and tasted like I was eating a chocolate covered green apple. As good as it was, the brandy was way overpowering and the beer was too boozy - and that's coming from someone thag likes a bit of booziness in BA stouts. The brandy barrel characteristics didnt mesh as well as I would have hoped with the base beer. It did open up a ton as it warmed up though - the brandy became tamer and the flavors melded together better. 
I'm going to lay my second and last remaining bottle down for at least a year for it to mellow out and hopefully age into a more cohesive beer. I see a lot of potential in this beer with a bit of aging - besides the booziness and overpowering brandy flavors, it's amazing. 919 charactersyoshie, Mar 28, 2017

Delicious, huge aroma of brandy, chocolate and caramel with a faint whiff of alcohol behind.  Sort of reminds me of a caramel apple, but with brownie batter and hot fudge thrown in, too.
So much caramel in the taste!  But with a slightly burnt flavor, like the edges of a well-done brownie, adding some balance. A little coffee, too.  There's definitely some brandy in there, with a faint apple quality, I guess, that sort of lingers in the sides of the mouth.  Slight warming alcohol in the finish as well.
It's medium bodied for the style -- super chewy in the nose, but less so in the actual mouthfeel.
I was worried that this would have a lot of apple-sweetness to it.  There's definitely caramel sweetness in there, but it's manageable with an almost RIS-style base balancing it out.  A fantastic dessert beer. 913 charactersthebeers, Mar 23, 2017
4.35/5  rDev -2.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5L- Typical black color without much head.
S- Lots of sweet apple. Just a hint of booze and chocolate. 
T- You pick up a little more of the stout flavors in the taste. Chocolate base with some caramel. The apple is still there, but not as prevalent as the smell. Just a bit of barrel. Very little heat in the taste. 
F- A little thinner than I would like, but still has a rich feel. Just a bit of warming alcohol burn on the finish. 
O- Pretty solid and a little different. I would like it to be a bit thicker or a little more roast to cut the sweetness slightly. 566 charactersZoomslowik, Mar 17, 2017

4.27/5  rDev -4.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25This beer pours pitch black with a late forming, half finger mocha colored head. Retention is non existent and there is no lacing at all.
The smell is excellent and the best part of this beer. Caramelized apple, brandy, booze, cinnamon, chocolate and roasted malts.
Taste is similar, but a touch more mellow than the smell. In the smell, each flavor is robust and distinct, but in the taste they seem to meld together more. I wouldn't call it a bad thing since it actually works well to cover up the booziness that was prevalent in the smell, but it also makes the flavors seem a touch muted.
Feel is medium bodied and slick. Very little carbonation. I would have expected the body to be a bit more full, but it is still quite nice.
Overall a very good beer. I was expecting to have my mind blown because of the cult status this beer seems to have so I am a bit let down, but I certainly wouldn't kick it out of bed in the morning. I wouldn't send it home in a town car with a gift basket a la Derek Jeter, but I'd go for another round, some morning sex, and call it a cab...Maybe even pay for it! 1,101 charactersCNoj012, Feb 01, 2017

~ 8 months from bottling date
Appearance- Pours a black color, glistening brown hues when swirled, oily body, opaque. Fine layer of dark tan colored head, few soapy bubbles. Alcohol legs coat and stain glass like a film. Small streaks of head lacing.
Aroma- Fudgy chocolate, tons of vanilla, creamy caramalized dark fruits. Spicy oak, booze soaked raisins, apples, sweet fruitiness. Hints of brown sugar, nuts, sticky molasses, and booze.
Taste- Lush chocolatey sweetness, caramel syrup, dessert like vanilla. Spiced apple pie filling, brown sugar sweetness, hazelnuts. Spicy oak, caramelized raisins, sweet apples soaked in booze, hints of roast.
Feel- Medium bodied, not overly thick. Very sticky texture and creamy. Lower carbonation.
Overall- Incredible richness and sweetness, with a very unique flavor profile. So much dessert qualities, with an apple sweetness and boozy character. The barrel aging really takes control and highlights the beer, adding so many wonderful flavors. One of the best beers ive had a chance to try. 1,050 charactersOrangeMen, Dec 31, 2016

Candy, brandy, malt. 
Sweetness from the barrelling, dark chocolate and a sorta brown sugar Belgian quality. Little heat, but the barrel adds a real unique flavor. A sipper because I don't want to finish this one.
Slick as you like, could be a touch denser. 299 characterspants678, Dec 18, 2016

Nose is very much boozy apple brandy and sweet chocolate.
Taste follows the nose with Apple Brandy, chocolate, sweetness, minor coffee, booze and oak.
Mouthful is medium and smooth but thin.  Carbonation is low.  Finish is semi sweet.
An awesome AB beer with a couple of drawbacks.  The booze note is pretty strong.  The mouthful could be heavier and thicker.  Those two notes aside, the nose is very nice and it matches the taste almost entirely which creates that much more of an enjoyable beer.  Very much recommend this. 599 charactersSlack, Dec 17, 2016

The aroma was largely an unfamiliar booziness, I'm assuming brandy. With chocolate and rich dark malts. The flavor is very sweet, tons of chocolate with a little bit of molasses. Midpalate the flavor is a little spicy with a lot of barrel character with a very nice apple wine like flavor on the finish.  Overall this is a very good beer worth picking up, there are better available BA stouts, but I would still try it. 444 charactersScott17Taylor, Dec 14, 2016

4.08/5  rDev -8.5%look: 3 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Viscous black with brown edges and minimal visible carbonation.
Smell is very nutty and woody, with some charred and burnt coals, a hint of maple, booze, vanilla, caramel, and roastiness.
Taste is boozy caramel, without much of that apple at first, aside from a hint of it in the essence of gooey caramel. The booziness makes the brandy a big player in this at first, but a nutty, woody oak and some roast begin to emerge. A little more apple rises as it warms, with some vanilla chews. Apple Brandy Noir improves impressively each minute while warming, becoming less boozy and more complex.
Feel is heavy with some tang, sparse fizz, finishing semi-dry but sticky. 668 charactersSabtos, Nov 28, 2016

Bottled late 2014; drank 11/26/15 @ the Yarchives. 
Black appearance. 
A violent pour yielded a nice dark tan head; nice lace. 
Apple brandy, milk chocolate & red wine notes in the nose. 
Thick mouthfeel. 
Chocolate syrup & smooth apple brandy flavors up front; red wine notes on the finish. Sweet brandy settled on my lips over the course of the quaff. A year has been kind to this bottle; although booze is present, it's mild & pleasant compared to its younger self. A sturdy, rich dessert brew. 671 charactersGuyFawkes, Nov 25, 2016

Thin brown head that dissipates very quickly.Thick dark black color...Hard to tell how much carbonation,if any at all.No signs of light through the glass.
The nose has a heavy presence of apple,brandy,and bourbon barrel ageing...Small signs of chocolate cake, and coffee.
The palate has a close resemblance to the nose...Strong apple/brandy accents,with small hints of chocolate,and coffee.Pretty thick in body.Small hints of pepper and hops on the back end,helps hide the alcohol beautifully!!!
Overall a very good Imperial Stout...Prairie Bomb! Is my favorite...I wouldn't put this one in the same category,but still a very good,very solid Imperial stout,and not far behind...Definitely going to keep a couple for ageing, and a couple for trade. 788 charactersDraconusDesanctus666, Nov 20, 2016

This is another very delicious offering from Prairie, and a beer I highly recommend. 524 charactersVictory_Sabre1973, Oct 17, 2016

The flavor is wonderful as well. Apple brandy fills the palate before chocolate, vanilla, wood, earth, and alcohol finishes the experience. Full body and carbonated just enough to give the stout some life. 489 charactersmorimech, Oct 12, 2016

 You can smell the liquor as soon as you pour the brew into the glass. Lovely and strong,  it hints strongly of Brandy, oak, and chocolate. 
 Upfront, the chocolate is the most significant flavor.  The booze from the brandy  his present throughout, but is far most dominant in the back half.  Coffee, toffee, and syrupy Caramel are also present in spades.  The brandy it really takes over in the end, carrying the brew to a lovely, slightly hot finish. 
 Exceptionally smooth for the sky high ABV.  You can tell it is boozy, but it is never remotely unpleasantly so. 
 Like drinking Christmas candy, this is a delightful, complex, and delicious brew. Unique. 783 charactersRoguer, Oct 04, 2016

An experience like no other. If you love beer, you have to try this. The apple brandy is so perfectly accentuating with that delicious noir base that this brew absolutely lives up to the hype. A little warm at 12%, a little sweet and tart like cider from the apple, that sharp brandy sweetness and booziness, the roasty malts near the end... the bitter/sweet/tart is perfect, it all flows flawlessly. It's really damn near perfect.
Tough to top for most people, I'd imagine. Tough to top. 626 charactersSerialTicker, Oct 02, 2016

4.21/5  rDev -5.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25I picked up a bottle of Prairie's Apple Brandy Noir at The Lager Mill.  I've been wanting to try this one since I first heard of it and I'm very interested to see how it turns out, so lets see how it goes.  2016 Vintage.  Poured from a brown 12oz bottle into a snifter.  
A-  The label looks good, it has a nice design and it's eye catching.  It poured a nice black color that didn't let any light come through  and it had a thin rings worth of bubbly tan head that quickly faded away and it left a little bit of spotty lacing behind.  This is a good beer, but I wish had better head and retention.  
S-  The aroma starts off with a lower amount of high sweetness with the apple brandy being the firs to show up, it has a distinct brandy aroma with a noticeable apple cider like aroma to it and it goes right into the malts which impart some dark malt, milk chocolate cocoa, roasted malt, brown sugar and light bready aromas.  Up next comes a dark fruit aromas followed by a noticeable alcohol aroma and a little more sweetness.  This beer has a very nice aroma, it lives up to it's name.  
T-  The taste seems to be similar to the aroma and it starts off with a lower amount of high sweetness with the apple brandy still being the first to show up and it imparts the same aspects that it did in the aroma with that same noticeable brandy, apple and apple cider like aspects that show up just a little more than they did in the aroma.  Up next comes the malts which imparts lots of sweet malts, roasted malts, dark malt, chocolate, cocoa and this time it imparts some very nice caramel flavors.  Up next comes a noticeable alcohol flavor that's a little warming and towards the end it goes into a little of dark fruit flavor with more caramel coming through.  It pretty much has no bitterness with some sweetness and booze taking it's place and on the finish there's some chocolate, apple brandy and caramel showing up in the aftertaste.  This is a very nice tasting beer, the combination of flavors grew on me and enjoyed it.  
M-  A little smooth, a little velvety, sticky, a little boozy, a little cloying, on the thicker side of being medium bodied with a lower amount of medium carbonation.  The mouthfeel is good and it works well with this beer.  
Overall I thought this was a very nice beer and a very nice example of the style, it had all the aspects that I was looking for, plus a couple that I wasn't expecting and when it comes down to it the combination of flavors and aromas made for a pretty unique beer and memorable beer.  This beer had ok drinkability, one is enough for me, anymore than that and it might start to wear on more.  What I like the most about this beer is how unique it is, the apple brandy seems to take the this beer to the next level.  What I like the least about this beer beer is how sweet it is and i think the booze could have been hidden a little better, bu t know that comes with the territory.  I would buy this beer again, if I see it and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a big, complex and unique beer.  All in all I was happy with this beer and a little impressed with it, Prairie shows they have some major skills when it comes to beers like this beer.  It's one of the better beers I've had from them and it's a very nice example of the style.  Great job guys, this is one tasty, complex and unique beer, keep up the hard work. 3,389 charactersStoutHunter, Sep 30, 2016

L:  Pours black with a small amount of tan head that dissipates quickly.
S:  Nose is chocolate, caramel, sweet green apple.
T:  Taste is big chocolate, caramel, some sweetness on the backend.  Feel like there is some roasted coffee there.  Reminds me of a chocolate-caramel apple.  Some peppery heat hear could be the alcohol sneaking through.
F:  Typical of Bomb! or any variant I have had.  Smooth, creamy.
O:  This is a fantastic beer, and another great variant of Bomb! from Prairie.  Delicious. 511 charactersNic1985Ace, Sep 12, 2016

I just want to smell this beer as it is an intoxicating pleasure of brandy, caramel, & apples. Taste follows the nose and is so smooth, like chocolate and caramel covered apples soaked in brandy with a nice roasty and slight booze to finish. Only slight knock and totally nip picking is it is slightly thin, Great sipper and it doesn't get much better than this one from Prairie, outstanding BA stout. 449 charactersGambyt20, Sep 06, 2016

Lots of wonderful smells here. Intense aroma of booze, caramel, maybe a bit of apple and fall fruits, cocoa powder.
Taste is quite sweet, tempered by a pleasant alcohol burn, but not nearly as boozy as BCBS. 
Shared with a non-beer-geek friend and he loved it. It's sweet and nearly cloying but i can handle it. There's a lot to love here. 427 charactersPDXAmbassador, Sep 04, 2016

3.85/5  rDev -13.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.75Doesn't pour as thick as bomb! Which is what I was expecting to be honest. The barrel wood is immediately apparent and it is one of those things you can't put tourniquet in unless you knew what it was. You get more caramel than apple but there is definitely some apple present. The taste follows the nose but it is a caramel explosion; ultra sweet. It finishes like those fruit filled caramel candies wrapped in cellophane your grandparents used to have. Very unique flavor. The feel is medium heavy with only a touch of carbonation; as it should be.  Overall I can't really say I liked it but it is such a unique taste it is definitely worth seeking out. I have a feeling this is a beer that will be much better with some time on it. It is overpoweringly sweet right now. I have a feeling it wil mellow and mesh when it gets a tad older. 838 charactersAmguerra305, Sep 03, 2016

SMELL: Massive waves of sweet and nutty apple brandy aromas are backed by strong aromas of sweet chocolate along with mild aromas of vanilla, toffee, coconut, molasses, sweet coffee, and caramel. Subtle aromas of oak and alcohol along with hints of bitter roasted malts provide an additional complexity. 
5 out of 5.
TASTE: The taste profile commences with a pleasantly powerful bombardment of sweet and nutty apple brandy flavors. Sweet chocolate flavors that rival the potency of the apple brandy immediately roll out along with my flavors of sweetened coffee. The sweetness is drastically intensified as mild toffee, caramel, vanilla and subtle molasses flavors incorporate themselves amongst the brew. Subtle flavors of oak and coconut present present a touch of barrel aging as the molasses flavors grow slightly stronger. Subtle flavors of bitter roasted malts and a subtle booziness conclude the symphony of taste as all previous flavors press on. 
4.75 out of 5
NOTE: This was near perfection. I loved how different this was in regards to the spirit characteristics. Usually the alcohol perception is equivalent to the strength of the spirit flavor. In this case, they were two separate experiences, with the apple brandy dominating and the alcohol playing the background. With that being said, if the alcohol was slightly less noticeable, this would be a perfect beer. 1,525 charactersMyotus, Aug 13, 2016

5/5  rDev +12.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5My first 5 rating in any category.  Nose is brandy-soaked caramel apple, with toffee, raisin, and fudge notes.   Palate is the same but much more complex, adding in cocoa dust, extra chocolate fudge and toffee, coconut, vanilla, and fig.   Rich, complex, and decadent.  Taste lingers forever.  Truly caught me off guard; in a different category than  any other variants I've had (including regular, Christmas, BA, and even pirate; I haven't had vanilla so I can't compare to that).  A dessert beer for sure, but phenomenal; definitely worth the price. 551 charactersfloyd_pugman, Aug 12, 2016

Nose is prevalent with strong brandy aroma, and mild Apple scent that takes a back seat to the Apple Brandy. Started off chilled and experienced strong Brandy flavor upfront and throughout. After it starts to warm, the Brandy moderates and Granny Smith Apple flavors start working their way through. Low carbonation and moderate to full mouth feel. Definitely drink this one slow to allow the Brandy to mellow as it warms and the Granny Smith Apple to come through. 515 charactersedthehead, Aug 11, 2016

4.71/5  rDev +5.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Look is typical imperial stout, pitch black and very little head.  The nose is strongly apple with brandy undertones.  The apple is milder on the flavor and insanely well integrated.  Brandy comes through with tons of marshmallow notes, vanilla, and brown sugar.  More reminiscent of a bourbon barrel aged beer than a brandy one in many ways.  It manages it all without ever being cloying or boozy.  One of the best beers I've had in a long time.  It makes me want to try and hunt down a bottle of whatever apple brandy came out of those barrels since it's clearly delicious. 575 charactersDactrius, Aug 07, 2016

Served in a snifter
Big thanks to my friend Bill for sharing this with me.
The thick, oily, near pitch black body was capped by a small, frothy, mocha colored crown that quickly fell to a tiny, bubbly ringlet. No lacing unfortunately.
The aroma was amazingly rich and decadent. Brown sugar, raisins and plums came through big time. Intense barrel presence. Not sure I would necessarily peg this as apple brandy barrel aged per se, but I definitely picked up on the sweet, boozy fruitiness. Nice and punchy without being hot. Loads of dark chocolate. Super fudgey. Hint of maple syrup too.
Like the nose, the flavor profile file was outstanding. Super rich, sweet and complex. Intense malty notes on the front end. Loads of brown sugar. Big chocolate presence too. Rich and somewhat fudgey. The apple brandy barrel notes came through strong on the back end. Similar to the nose in that this was quite boozy without being hot. The beer finished with a nice mix of roasted malts, brandy barrel and some lingering sweetness.
The mouthfeel was rich, lush and oily. Fuller bodied for the style. The liquid contained a super fine, supple, tongue blanketing effervescence.
Prairie makes a number of terrific beers, but this was definitely their most impressive offering I have tried to date. With such a rich and decadent base, it is no surprise that the apple brandy barrels upped the complexity to another level of awesomeness. 1,457 charactersDamian, Aug 06, 2016

Aroma of sweet, dark toasted malt, molasses, toffee and brandy, very inviting. Flavor is apple brandy, dark toasted malt with very little char, chocolate, toffee, hints of molasses. Finishes with great lingering dark malt and apple brandy. ABV well covered. Nice creamy body and carbonation, despite the lackluster head. A new Prairie stout is always something to look forward to, and this may be one of my favorites. There is a moment in the taste when I detect a hint of dark chocolate covered caramel, and it is quite welcome. I am in the habit of touching up the last part of a mediocre stout with a small bit of apple brandy (Laird's), and it really improves almost anything. I was still uncertain if I would like it as a barreling treatment, but no need to worry. While an average stout with just a little apple brandy becomes much more drinkable, a great stout like this one in brandy barrels is just plain delicious. Great chocolatey malt flavors and a very well proportioned brandy component. This is superb. Kudos. 1,122 charactersLiquidAmber, Aug 04, 2016

The apple brandy cask addition to me is too much sweetness.  It adds a layer that slightly thins the body and just gives it an over the top fruitiness.  I prefer the regular version. 293 charactersphishgator, Jul 29, 2016

5/5  rDev +12.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5My favorite version of Bomb! yet, this is a stunningly intense, syrupy experience with tons of dark roast, a subdued but definite coffee underpinning, coconut vanilla, apricot,s, dates, and figs (all soaked in smooth and mellow brandy goodness. It's a very sweet beer, but there is just enough bitter coffee and roast to compel some very hard tasting, and the reward is an incredible, delightfully decadent assault on the palate. This gem, along with Fremont's spectacular Rusty Nail, has rekindled my passion for over-the-top Imperial Stouts. 543 charactersImpfan, Jul 24, 2016

Appearance: Pours midnight black with a moderate amount of bubbles. Slight finger of tan head that quickly fades away. 
Smell: A rich, roasty, and boozy aroma with a scent of brandy, apple, chocolate, and coffee. Big barrel presence with a scent of brandy, apple, vanilla, oak, and wood. Dark roasted barley malt with a scent of chocolate, coffee, toast, smoke, biscuit, and yeast. Sweet scent of molasses and brown sugar. Subtle hints of anise, leather, tobacco, and dark fruit.  A really good aroma. 
Taste: Like it smells, a rich, boozy, and roasty taste with notes of brandy, apple, chocolate, and coffee. Upfront barrel presence with notes of brandy, apple, vanilla, oak, and wood. Dark roasted malt with notes of dark chocolate, coffee, toast, biscuit, smoke, and yeast. Sweet taste of molasses, brown sugar, and syrup. Subtle undertones of leather, tobacco, anise, and dark fruit. A really great taste. 
Mouthfeel: Full bodied with a moderate amount of carbonation. Rich, slick, and syrupy. Some alcohol heat as expected but it isn't overly hot. 
Overall: A really great Barrel Aged Stout. Very nice blend of apple brandy and dark roast flavors. 1,201 charactersMattyG85, Jul 23, 2016

Black; close to still even with a hard pour; but after tasting it, this thing is beautiful. The nose is tempting: green apples, chocolate, raw wood, & a booziness that I couldn’t have identified, but is surely brandy. Not a bad start. 
Apple Brandy Noir has solved the problem of apple brandy being overwhelmed by a big stout; it flips the tables upside down. The apple brandy is hot & dominant & tasty, with the apples dipped in vanilla. Light spicing, dense chocolate, hazelnuts, wood mix & chat mid-palate. Mouthfeel is the definition of decadent, rich, full, silky, beautiful. Should come in bombers for the days when I don’t have to get up for days. 
I wouldn’t have given up my trip to Italy to hunt more of these down, but I’d have sacrificed a trip to St. Cloud, or Bagley, or Rochester. I have no reason not to score this as it tastes: top shelf. I hope it reappears on a regular basis, because I will be buying like a bearded hoarder. 1,130 charactersmaximum12, Jul 20, 2016

Smell is out of this world - caramel taffy apple, vanilla, fudge, some coffee - might be the best smelling beer I've ever encountered 
Taste follows the nose, pretty much most of the smells present  Some barrel is noticeable, slight alcohol as it warms
Mouth feel is perfect. Sooo smooth I don't know how Prairie makes a beer this his ABV that's so smooth, not overly sweet and not much of an alcohol burn.  Sooo good  heavier body and lower carb

The beer pours a blackish brown color with very good head retention and considerable lacing.  The nose on this beer is impressive, and tips you right off that this will a pretty outstanding beer.  There's considerable apple brandy, which much to my surprise. blends well with the dark chocolate, nestles quick, vanilla and light coffee I pick up.  The flavor profile is more of the same, though I thought the sweetness was a bit much (hence the minor detraction).  Still, on the palate, I initially picked up considerable fudge brownie, which then seemed to morph into a nestles quick chocolate finish.  Very impressive.  Mouthfeel is fairly full, with a long, sweet, chocolate and brandy infused finish.  Alcohol is noticeable, but then this is a 12% abv. beer.  Still, there was no heat or bite from alcohol on the finish.  
Very impressive beer from the folks at Prairie. 921 charactersJohn_M, Jul 10, 2016

4.87/5  rDev +9.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 512oz bottle poured into a tulip.  Pours a pitch black with no head.  Nose is apple brandy up front (a boozy dark fruit smell).  The coffee and chocolate of the imperial stout are perhaps lingering somewhere in the background, but they are supplanted by this unique (and phenomenal) nose.  The palate leads with more direct brandy (less apple than the nose and more dark fruit) and progresses to a deep dark chocolate, molasses, and brown sugar imperial stout profile (limited coffee here).  An exceptional, robust, and profoundly nuanced palate.  Mouthfeel is thick, and suits the beer extremely well, though not quite as thick as I would have anticipated.  Overall, an artfully crafted imperial stout with a very well chosen additive.  Absolutely blown away by this beer. 772 charactersLAp, Jul 10, 2016

Smells wonderful when you pop it and the taste is off the charts.   I can see how perhaps some people may feel that the sweetness is maybe too much but for me, it was perfect.  I don't leave a lot of reviews but I do for the beers that I crave more when I have them.  1 was not enough for me.... I want  more.   So smooth and so tasty.... good job Prarie Artisan Ales.

Very dark appearance.  Black as night.  Poured like used motor oil with no foam head at all.  Smell was chocolate and booze.  I could tell by the smell the heat was going to be there (which I enjoy).  Taste was chocolate, coffee, caramel and apple lightly present.  Brandy was unmistakable.  Sticky mouth feel with some heat coming toward the end, especially as it warmed.
Overall: surprised, in a very good way.  This might be my favorite Prairie beer over BA Bomb! and Pirate Bomb! 498 characterseifster82, Jul 08, 2016

Smell-  WOW.   Chocolate up front, apple brandy on back end.   Alcohol makes its presence well known as well.
Taste-  loved the way this beer tasted.  My fav Prairie beer so far.  Tastes like brandy soaked chocolate brownies.  The apple barrel taste hits late and is a pleasant taste,
Mouthfeel- super creamy, very appropriate for this style
Overall-  I loved this beer.   As this beer warms up the apple taste becomes more prominent.  Seek this beer out, very very good beer from OK. 538 charactersjcflorian, Jul 04, 2016

4.59/5  rDev +2.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.512 oz. bottle, Julian code bottle date 13416 printed on the bottleneck, vintage 2016.  Acquired a single bottle of this stuff from the local beer store - "Imperial Stout Aged in Apple Brandy Barrels".  My first encounter with any variant of Noir from Prairie.
Poured into a clear balloon snifter.
A - A thick oily viscous black-brown pour, conjures no head to speak of, merely some khaki-brown bubbles that settle in as a small ring.  One delicate strand of lacing holds on.  Appears thick, sticky, full, & sugary. Looks amazing.
S - 'Wow' came to mind initially. Huge huge aromas of sticky sweet chocolate, caramel, toffee, vanilla, fudge, oak wood, alcohol fumes, & huge in-your-face-amazeballs beautiful candied taffy apple (caramel-dipped apples).  I get a sort of licorice / anise type spiciness on the end as the beer settles, also.  Altogether, huge sticky gooey fudgey caramel-dipped apples on the nose. This is the first beer I've had aged in apple brandy barrels, and this was very impressive, so for that i am giving it the 5.
T - Taste brings in more of the same, but i feel it just the slightest bit dialed back from what the aroma offers up.  Big notes of chocolate, vanilla, toffee, fudge, some booze heat, and caramel-dipped green apples on the end.  Spice? it's hard to say, but there is very slight residual warmth.  No overt alcohol heat or burn, however; this is super easy-drinking stuff for the high abv.
M - Feel is silky smooth & creamy, feels maybe a touch watery / light for a 12.00% barrel-aged stout.  Dangerously drinkable stuff for the high abv. Mild alcohol warmth on the finish.  Semi-sticky / sweet, but not overly sugary by any means.
Overall, an amazing barrel aged stout from Prairie; this is some seriously next level type shit that i would rank amongst the great barrel-aged beers of all time; certainly the best apple brandy barrel aged beer i've tried, and i'm sure it will be a while before i can find a rival.

4.25/5  rDev -4.7%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a 12 ounce tulip.  A vigorous pour produced no head and nearly no lacing from the thin circle around the edge of the glass.  Color is a deep, thick black.  The smell of brandy hits while pouring and is noticeable from several feet away.  The taste is immediately very sweet with brown sugar and brandy dominating the flavor.  There is a subtle apple flavor on the back end but comes out stronger as it warms.  For 12% abv there is very little alcohol burn other than in the aftertaste.  The apple also comes through strong in the aftertaste.  There is a medium level of carbonation even without the head.  Overall this is a great beer.  The sweet brandy flavor is very strong.  Would make a great dessert beer, almost like a port.  My rating would be slightly higher if it was less sweet, but that's just personal preference. 860 charactersjvgoor3786, Jun 28, 2016

Pours black, with thinner body and a tiny, tan head that vanishes with no sign of ever existing.
Smell is so good I want to bury my face in the glass... I kind of don't want to drink it, I just want to smell the sweet notes of chocolate, vanilla and oak. 
Taste is better than the smell, many of the same flavors, but then the deep fruity, brandy flavors sneak in. Might be some bitterness, and that might actually be a little tart, but everything in harmony.
Feel is the only place this could maybe improve, but even that is being a real picky bastard. Its a Noir, and doesn't have the body of the Bomb family, but its nice and oily, sticky and doesn't overwhelm in any direction.
Overall, this is close to being a 5, and if maybe it had some more body it would be. Regardless, its excellent. 873 charactersGreatStoutman, Jun 25, 2016

Look - very very dark brown body, thick, small tan head, and some but not a ton of lacing
Smell - brandy and chocolate!  really sweet and boozy (in a great way) smelling
Taste - a little caramelly apple, lots of sweet tasty brandy, and smooth and silky milk chocolate.  Not super complex but it doesn't need to be.  This is delicious cold and a little more as it warms.  The oak comes through after warming.
Feel - creamy but not super thick.  Coats the mouth well.  Very drinkable for 12% with really almost no booze
Overall - i love brandy barrel aged stouts and this is nothing different.  I love this offering from Prarie and glad I got a few this batch.  Great balance of nice, almost simple flavors, but the complexity just isn't needed with how well this is put together. 828 charactersrabbott2, Jun 20, 2016

Aroma is excellent, like caramel covered apples. Equal hints of vanilla, toffee, and sweet chocolate. Wood and oak are noticable more as it warms. The taste is initially apples, hints of caramel, vanilla and bakers chocolate. This quickly faded in half a second and you get a sharp, pop of sweet brandy and oak in the back end. Mouthfeel is relatively thick and sticky. Hints of booze sticks around for a while. Overall, definitely a top 3 Prarie favorite in my opinion. 574 charactersMateo2699, Jun 15, 2016

Aroma boozy sweetness with notes of roasted chocolate malt and rich nuttiness. Flavor is smith boozy brandy with some sweetness. You get a really nice roasted malt and chocolate note and there's an overall rich walnut like flavor. Feel is nice, a little thinner than I would have thought but still nice. Overall a really delicious beer. 387 charactersStevem68, Jun 06, 2016

4.21/5  rDev -5.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Aroma is heavily brandy laden, with rich dark chocolate and subtle apple adding depth. Fudgy, vanilla, with a hint of dark fruit. Very nutty, toasted.
Flavor is very caramelly, with big brandy notes and a roasty malt finish that's just short of charred. The apple is all but lost, at this point. Still, a very tasty beer. Got some heat to it, and wish the brandy were toned down a bit to let the base beer shine. 413 charactersbarczar, May 02, 2016

S: just as good as the 2015 bottle I had. Smell is chocolate coated candied apples. Fudgey and dark chocolate come through. Incredibly sweet and good smell. Light notes of oak. 
T: very similar to smell but the astringency of the Brandy alcohol comes through. A ton of candied Apple and some tastes of Brandy alcohol vapors on the back palette. Everything that the smell has the taste has intensified over and over. Very sweet but balanced. Very quaffable but the Brandy let's you know it's there. Nice warm feeling in stomach as it goes down. 
F: thick oily and covers mouth with a flavorful body that will give your palette tastes of chocolate for a long time. Maybe not as thick as bomb but it's cloying sweetness makes up for it. My lips are sticky from drinking this. 
O: the 2015 and 2016 are equally enjoyable the same cannot be said for 2015 and '16 KBS. So I'm impressed that Prairie knocked it out of the park both times for me. I will look forward to this beer every year they choose to release it and will update my review everytime. I am biased because this is the beer that got me into beer so it retains its 5/5 rating. Absolutely wonderful. 1,218 characterspuffthestuff, Apr 23, 2016

S: Quite possibly the best and most unique smelling brew I can recall. Apple pie, rich caramel, homemade fudge, and a touch of vanilla. It is intoxicatingly sweet yet complex, like a Thanksgiving kitchen baking holiday-time goodies.
T: The same sweet apple pie and caramel qualities of the aroma are present, but flavor skews more towards some Baker's chocolate and roasted barley notes. Also some nice wood character and lingering alcohol burn. A touch of astringency on the back end.
F: Smooth medium-full body with only modest carbonation. Creamy and silky-smooth. Complements the overall experience nicely.
O: I am comfortable saying this is my favorite Noir variant, and maybe even my favorite Prairie beer. The aroma is second to none and I would certainly like to see more apple brandy barrels used for aging. I think some people mistakenly expect  apple-like flavors, when in reality it's closer to a more rich and sweet whiskey/bourbon barrel quality. 1,064 charactersRyeSoSerious, Jan 17, 2016

There's a fingernail of beige around the rim and also forming a circle about the size of a quarter in the middle.  I smell loads of dark roasted barley and sweet apple brandy.  The taste is a beautiful juxtaposition of intensely bitter roasted barley and sweet apple brandy.  The mouth is thick, viscous, and creamy. 363 charactersFranziskaner, Jan 16, 2016

A - Nice appearance.  Dark tar black body with a medium mocha head that pours 1/2 a finger high.  Low retention and lace.
S - Holy crap.  The nose is absolutely fantastic.  Rich caramel, apple cider, brandy, sweet aged sherry, milk chocolate, and soft oak.
T - Wow, this is incredible.  Caramel, apples, milk chocolate, dark cherries, prune, rich tawny port, soft smoke, and pumpernickel bread. 
M - Medium-light body, but surprisingly smooth.

Huge chocolate aroma, nougat, hints of the barrel and apple brandy giving it a rich holiday cake type of nose. Ultimately the smell trumps the the flavor. The barrel and spirit notes decouple from the flavor and you end up with a delicious chocolatey front end that falls away as the spirit rises up, leaving a brandy heat lingering, bringing a bit of a grape and baked apple element with it. 452 charactersKurmaraja, Nov 18, 2015

Poured into a Dogfish traditional oversized snifter.  No freshness date.
A- Pours a fully opaque black color with a 1/4 inch dark tan head that retains well before becoming a thick ring around the edge of the glass and a small side patch of bubbly surface foam.
S- Luscious milk chocolate aroma that's backed up by the sweet brandy barrel character.  Oaky with some vanilla and caramel in there too.
T- Flavor follows suit with more chocolate and a solid barrel quality containing grainy wood notes.    Oaky aftertaste.  Very impressed with how much actual barrel presence there is in this.  Ever-so-slightly boozy but overall the alcohol is very well masked.  Excellent raisin aftertaste.
M- Creamy and thick with medium-low carbonation and a full body.
O- Met my expectations and even exceeded them a bit.  A smooth Brandy BA stout that should be sipped and savored but is so drinkable and tasty it's hard to not keep going back for more. 989 charactersImmortale25, Sep 10, 2015

S: very heavy booze smell and a definite sweet apple smell as well
T: this is an odd beer. Huge booze taste, some vanilla hints, and leaves a nice Apple lingering taste
F: creamy, slightly carbonated, and a lot of boozy heat on this
O: this is a nice, but different stout. Certainly gets better as it warms. Glad I tried it but would not seek it out again. I think I should have let this sit another year to let the booze die down. 475 characters-Rick, Sep 08, 2015

4.49/5  rDev +0.7%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.512oz bottle poured into a teku glass
A- pours midnight black with a small creamy dark tan head that retains long after the pour, leaving some thick patches of lacing behind and eventually settling to a think layer floating on top, beautiful looking beer
S- the aroma of a caramel candied apple pops out of the glass with a deep melted caramel sweetness, and a slight tart aroma of apple skin poking through.  Beyond that, notes of tiramisu, brandy, vanilla, oak, butterscotch, and baked cinnamon apples come through.  Just a hint of alcohol on the backend is the only thing deterring this from a perfect aroma 
T- the fruity apple pops up immediately upon tasting with a flavor of red apple skin.  This is quickly followed by sweet melted caramel with undertones of chocolate.  The brandy kicks in mid-palate along with hints of coffee and whipping cream, the finish gives more caramel with a linger of apple & a hint of alcohol
M- medium thick body with low carbonation leads to a creamy mouthfeel that continues into a silky smooth finish, staying creamy and smooth throughout, some alcohol warmth on the linger   
O- a sipper that is certainly a treat to drink, the taste isn't as complex as the aroma, but the barrel aging adds a big complexity to an already solid base beer, well worth seeking out 1,307 charactersTreyliff, Aug 14, 2015

Poured dark and black with a short mocha head that settled to a fleeting collar.  The nose and taste were full and round featuring sweet roasted grain, cocoa,  espresso, caramel, toffee, some spice and nice, warm, boozy brandy.  It is full, round and dangerously drinkable.  Overall, I wish I had a nother bottle or two for the cellar to see what some age will do. 405 charactersmtomlins, Aug 13, 2015

The aroma is slight but intriguing with vanilla liqueur, tiramisu, caramel, and chocolate. The only one of those flavors to come through strong on the taste is that smooth chocolate present in all the prairie stouts. Most of the rest of the spirit gets lost in the booze. Mouth feel is medium and smooth, but the booze leaves and unpleasant burn on the palate and make this one hard to finish. 456 charactersdanh53, Aug 08, 2015

Consumed: 8.3.15
A: 4.5 Pitch black with a uniform, light tan head that lasts a couple minutes.
S: 4.5 First, there’s lots of booze, espresso, vanilla, and chocolate; it actually smells a lot like tiramisu. As the beer warms, sweet apple, cinnamon, and roasted malt come through as well. 
T: 4.5 The flavors start off rather sweet then move on to roasted malt bitterness. After a couple minutes, the flavors from the nose start to show up, but the tiramisu and apple elements are a bit dominated by the roastiness. The finish is slightly boozy and bitter; both are mild, but could be dialed back a bit. 
M: 4.5 Very rich and creamy with great carbonation. Like on the palate, the only thing hindering this beer is the slight booziness which hurts drinkability a bit.
O: 4.5 The aromas alone make this beer really special. I haven’t encountered too many apple brandy aged beers, but this make me want to seek more out. While the taste didn’t quite match the smell, it’s still an excellent beer. I’d like to try one aged a year or two, as I’m sure it will be mellowed out, balanced, and near perfect. 1,136 charactersTele, Aug 04, 2015

Smell is very chocolaty with hints of apple, oak, coffee, and a bit of alcohol. Kinda reminds me of those chocolate candies with liquor on the inside. Taste is very rich in dark chocolate, coffee, and dark fruits, with some apple and oak. The barrel character is very light which I like. Slight alcohol burn. Mouthfeel is super smooth and creamy. Carbonation is on the low end but about where it should be for a stout. Overall a fantastic BA stout. Surprisingly drinkable. That 12% really sneaks up on you. 579 charactersMisSigsFan, Jul 11, 2015

a - slick silky black. rich and sludgy w a finger of cream tan colored head w stringy lace.
s - nose is brandy over deep rich chocolate. some sangria fruitiness but very brandy assertive.
t/m/o - nice blend of barrel and beer with the barrel grabbing the 60% vs the 40% from the roch chocolatey stout. fairly boozy, but everything works. nice stout with nice barrel, worth checking out, but dont kill yourself trying to get it. very very good beer. 517 characterscosmicevan, Jun 21, 2015

4.02/5  rDev -9.9%look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured from a 12oz bottle into a Prairie Dino Glass. Acquired as an extra in a trade.
Pours a dark brown, nearly black body with a modest 1 finger light mocha head that reduces slowly to leave a thin film of lacing and a ring of retention.
After letting it warm for a bit, aromas of chocolate, vanilla, boozy brandy, a unique fruity aromas which I'm guessing is the apple brandy. 
On the tongue upfront is a sweet vanilla, brandy, caramel flavor, followed by a bit of booziness, dark fruits, a hint of soy, with a nice roastyness on the finish which I feel redeemed the flavor of this beer, which I found to be a little boozy and unbalanced in the beginning. Medium-heavy body, low carbonation.
Overall interesting and unique, I've never gotten the notes that the apple brandy barrels imparted on this beer in any other beer. Let it warm up to enjoy all the flavors. 870 charactersgcamparone, Jun 08, 2015

Pours nice creamy head that fades fairly quickly, nice legs, pitch black beer.
Nose brings some fudgey dark chocolate, caramel chewy nougat notes, tons of apple brandy, syrupy candy apple, mild cookie wafer and dough. 
Taste brings sweet candy malts, dark choc, biscuity cookie wafer, choc chip cookie and semi sweet choc. But with that is loads of apple brandy, nice barrel toasted oak notes, so much apple brandy it's crazy. Candy apple, syrup condensed brandy, apple cider almost, caramel apple. Some coffee roasty bitterness, no alcohol either. Finish is sticky mildly sweet, lingering mild roast, cookie dough, cocoa, and tons of apple brandy, caramel apple lingering. 
Mouth is med to fuller bod, decent carb, no booze. Creamy smooth. 
Overall this was awesome, great barrel, great base beer with cocoa and choc, great cookie flavor, awesome brandy, just great in all aspects. 954 charactersjlindros, Jun 06, 2015

A - Poured into a Kate the Great tulip a nice oily black hue with a thin mocha head that fades to leave nice legs and a good halo.
S - Aromas of apple brandy galore, so much chocolate. Apple brandy bomb...do I have to say more?
T - Taste is similar to the nose, caramel apples, brandy, chocolate, vanilla, barrel. Alcohol hidden so well. Very cookie like, chocolate dipped caramel apples really sums this up. Alcohol is very light on the finish. 
M - Mouthfeel is lightly carbonated, creamy, low ABV. 
O - Overall this beer was absolutely delicious. Best prairie beer I've had.

12oz bottle to Prairie Tulip
2015 Release
App- Its a good looking stout. Was a little shocked at the lack of head on this one. Poured inky black. Like BLACK. Small 1/4" head was there and gone. Not really a lace or cling to mention. Pond layer on the top.
Smell- Its a like disjointed but It smelled nice at points. When cold a little more of the astringent face wash aromas were there. When I wrapped my hands around the glass and let it warm, it was more of the brandy with a sweetness and vanilla. Points of oak and brownies came wofting up.
Taste- There is so much going on in this glass. Fresh baked brownies when it warmed and when it was still a bit chilled the apple brandy comes across with more of the vanilla and barrel character with some chocolate covered cherry flavors.
Mouth- A slightly lighter bodied medium feel with a semi prickly medium carbonation. Some of the astringent aromas flows down to the body. A good amount of barrel and sweetness remains on this one.
Drink- It was a nice barrel treatment. Prairie does some really nice beers. This was certainly unique in that most people/brewers shy away from Apple Brandy. Only have seen  a handful of this treatment. Nice mix of flavors in this one. 1,243 charactersFosterJM, May 23, 2015

4.3/5  rDev -3.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.512 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 1/20/2015. Pours dense pitch black color with a 1 finger dense dark brown head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a light amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, molasses, apple, toffee, vanilla, toast, dark bread, tobacco, dark fruit, oak, and roast/oaky earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roast/bready malt and brandy barrel notes; with good strength. Some brandy booziness is present in the aromas as it warms, but not too strong; though it still seems to cut through some of the malt richness/complexity of the aromas. Taste of huge dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, molasses, apple, toffee, vanilla, toast, dark bread, tobacco, dark fruit, oak, and roast/oaky earthiness. Good amount of roasted bitterness and oak spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, cocoa, coffee, molasses, apple, toffee, vanilla, toast, dark bread, tobacco, dark fruit, oak, and roast/oaky earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt and brandy barrel flavors; with a nice roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light carbonation and full bodied; with a very smooth, creamy and fairly slick/chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with a light-moderate warmth lingering after the finish. Overall this is an outstanding brandy barrel aged imperial stout. All around awesome complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt and brandy barrel flavors; and quite smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering. 1,748 characterssuperspak, May 16, 2015

The apple brandy noir has a killer nose and nice creamy head that left amazing lacing down my glass, but that's about it for the highlights. The taste is basically the base stout with little to no barrel. I really wish Prairie would stop with this bullshit and just go back to making good saisons, which made me follow them from the 1st place. When is the last time they brewed Ale, Merica, or Hop? Seems like all they're focused on is making varients of Noir and Bomb that taste exactly like the original base but cost twice as much.
2nd batch review on 7/14/16
No head or lacing. Strong whiskey smell, not nearly as nice as batch 1. This one has much more whiskey notes on the taste. Much different from the last bottle I tasted last year. Still not worth $12 a bottle and quite possibly the last Prairie beer I will ever buy due to thier pricing. 1,033 charactersStArnoldFan, May 01, 2015

Taste - Apple brandy is tingly and boozy right up front.  Fudge and dark chocolate.  Pretty sweet.  Oak in the finish.
Mouthfeel - Heavy.  Low carbonation.
Overall - The stout itself lacks a little richness, but it's got some really nice flavors. 443 charactersAlieniloquium, Apr 28, 2015

Wish there would've been some lacing/head retention; doesn't really bring this experience down that much...
S:  Chocolate, vanilla, faint booze, booze picks up as this warms
T:  Follows the nose, a little pear & apple, plummyness too, a little dryness & barrel up front.  Vanilla, caramel, a little brandy & oakyness; faint bitterness let's call it charred grains & a little apple peel as this warms.   Finishes dry, with a booze warmth, caramel & apple brandy notes
MF:  Medium body, smooth carbonation, silky, warming 
A bonafide classic that Prairie needs to do again on a bigger scale.  Easily in my top 3 of Prairie's offerings; even if my rating might not quite reflect that... 804 charactersrusspowell, Apr 27, 2015

The nose is crazy! It is full of flavor and color. Really powerful. 
Finish is perfect

I love the Pirate Bombs but this just blows everything out of the water.  I'm letting one age to see how well it develops but i cant imagine it getting much better.  Smooth as hell, not overwhelming with the apple brandy, but its also not covered up too much. I have only given 2 other all 5s, and that was double barrel hunahpu's and the BC Bramble rye.  If you have any of these  i will buy or trade for them. 502 charactersJohnny_Cardboard, Apr 16, 2015

4.51/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.25 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a bottle into a Wicked Weed tulip. Pours out very black and opaque, a bit viscous, and fairly low in carbonation with about a finger of brown foamy head. Very interesting nose on this beer. Not sure I've come across another quite like it. Lots of dark semisweet chocolate, burnt oak, a hint of espresso, and a nice rich boozy, rummy note.
The beer has a full body, a very round, fat feel, and a roasty, boozy, complex flavor. It opens up with sweet, earthy molasses, brown bread, and burnt caramel flavors. Then, hints of booze, toasted oak, espresso, mocha, and a hint of smoke develop across the palate. Port wine flavors, dark cherries, and figs show up on the back end. It finishes well with a mild, warming bit of alcohol - just enough to volatilize the beer and evaporate all those wonderful subtle roasty, sugary, fruity, and oaky flavors, bringing them back around for a nice finale. The oak and brown sugar notes stick in your palate for a short while.
Wow, what a beer. Perhaps not one that I would choose to drink repeatedly, but definitely one that is worth visiting. The complexity of the flavor is wonderful. I can definitely see why some BAs really love it. I don't think I love it, but I do like it - a lot. The complexity really draws you in and challenges you. I like that in a beer and really savor those beers that do it, even if it's not one that suits my palate perfectly. I hope I get to revisit this one again someday. Highly recommended. 1,476 charactersdeadonhisfeet, Apr 10, 2015

4.32/5  rDev -3.1%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours black into my stout glass, with a rich body that appears luscious despite the faded tan head. Nice lacing. 
Smells terrific despite alcohol being present on the nose. The milk chocolate licorice note is spot-on for me. Hints of apple are buried within the burn. Can't wait to sip this. 
Taste is like the smell, but not as sweet as I'd expect. This really kicks so hard though is what strikes me most, in a pretty good way, but almost as if this was beyond 16% abv. and not the 12% it states to be. It's an acidic/ anise apple-barrel-bite that is inviting, although I'd more prefer if the profile was more mellowed-out. But for what this is, it's quite a good sipper. It is what it is. 
Feels medium thick and medium-low carbonated, whiskey-like burn. Balanced, nice feel. 
This is a big beer, a terrific stout considering the apple, which is done with barrel-burning precision as opposed to being a cloy-bomb. 916 charactersTBoneJones, Apr 10, 2015

I'm loving the frothiness on this beer's head. It's chewy looking and looks like something I could make a meal of. I also like the dark khaki color and the wall of lace the receding leaves behind. Pitch black body looks like it'll offer some flavor. 5
I wasn't expecting that nose. That's definitely apple brandy. Impressive how the apple is perceivable. Brandy notes are sticky and a little bit astringent. Rich dark chocolate layers over this. The combination reminds me slightly of root beer or cream soda. 4
Apple brandy and dark chocolate are just as prominent on the palate as on the nose. A strong current of vanilla adds some sweetness and smooths the flavor out a bit. Mid-palate tastes a bit like a toasted coconut donut. The brandy is so pronounced it seems like I poured some from a bottle myself into my stout rather than having it actually aged in a brandy barrel. Interestingly enough, as I get deeper in, the beer becomes a bit more smoky/peaty like it was whiskey-barrel aged. I like this dimension of the beer though and the beer overall is really growing on me. 4.25
It's a tad hot given that it does feel like the brandy's been blended in. Mouthfeel is thick, semi-viscous and a bit bitter and solventy on the finish. 4
There's a lot to like about this beer but it also is a bit rough around the edges. 1,359 charactersONovoMexicano, Apr 08, 2015

3.74/5  rDev -16.1%look: 3.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 3.75Brief initial impressions from a 2015 vintage bottle:
HEAD: None.
BODY: Predictably, it's an opaque black.
AROMA: I definitely get the apple brandy along with some green apple. Dark malt and schwarz malt sweetness disappears beneath the admittedly slightly boozy barrel notes. Seductive, but I'm not sure the barrel notes are really bringing out the best in the base, or accentuating what's already there as opposed to adding just new overbearing notes. This will be interesting.
Aromatic intensity is above average.
TASTE: The apple brandy is showcased nicely, and brings plenty of barrel complexity, replete with the requisite green apple and brandy notes. I'm not very well acquainted with brandy, but this has more of a liquor feel than a wine feel, with a lingering candied finish redolent of candy apple/caramel apple and even wintergreen/mint notes. It's not too sweet, but then the malt backbone is largely eclipsed by the barrel. This is a beer built to emphasize the barrel rather than to emphasize a harmony of barrel to base - which is fine. It's balanced and enjoyable, with a long flavour duration owing to that lasting wintergreen, and a nice depth of flavour.
TEXTURE: Medium-bodied, well-carbonated (near perfectly), smooth, and wet. Unrefreshing. Not as soft as would be ideal, but it nails the richness.
OVERALL: She's a sipper, but she's wonderful. Really a lovely imperial stout, even though it emphasizes the barrel above the base. I quite like it and would absolutely get it again; I'm glad I have a bottle at home for a full review. I'd definitely recommend it to friends and trade partners. More great work from Prairie, and a testament to the quality of brandy barrel aging.
Low B+ (3.81)
***
04.12.15: further impressions from a 2015 vintage.
BOTTLE: 12 fl oz. Great label art & design. Branded pry-off pressure cap.
12% ABV.
Served cold into a snifter and allowed to warm over the course of consumption. Expectations are high given my last experience with it.
HEAD: ~1 finger wide. Tan colour. Creamy. soft-looking, luscious, rich. Leaves a coating of light even lacing on the sides of the glass as the head recedes.
Retention is subpar - ~1.5 minutes.
BODY: Opaque black. Not quite an ink-black, but dark.
Has no visible yeasty muck.
An apt appearance for an imperial stout.
AROMA: The barrel presence is fantastic, bringing rich notes of refined white oak, decadent apple brandy, faint vanilla, and wine-like notes of sherry and port. Very much a dessert beer aroma. Fortunately, there isn't much of a green apple presence - which tends to be a note I'm not keen on in beer. It's not real grapey as one might expect.
The barrel seems to complement but not accentuate the base, which offers notes of cream, dark/schwarz malts, chocolate malts, and coconut, but sadly no roasted barley.
As it warms, hints of burnt sugar emerge, and the subtle dark fruit presence develops, bringing notes of fig and muted plum.
Not a hoppy or yeasty aroma.
A mild to moderately intense aroma.
FINAL THOUGHTS: It's a fine dessert beer, with a port-like red wine presence complemented nicely by the base beer's dark fruit. The green apple is noticeable but not detrimental, and the brandy barrel sets off the dark malts nicely, giving this sweet imperial stout decadent intrigue. Some roasted barley or coffee to counter the malty sweetness with some bitterness would be nice, but the chocolate malt is nice - and is set off nicely by the silky mouthfeel. Some grape does seep in as it comes to temperature, lending it a somewhat sticky mouthfeel.
It's aptly creamy, with a mellow smooth presence on the palate and an apt weight. Full-bodied without being overbearing. Well-carbonated.
The oak presence is more reticent than suggested by the aromatics. I do find the coconut - which is a treat alongside the faint vanilla and helps mute the green apple - which I'm not sure I'm keen to.
I do come around a bit on the apple brandy as it comes to temperature, but overall I think bourbon is a better supplement to imperial stouts than apple brandy.
Still, this is a treat of an imperial stout and I can see why it has such a high reputation, but it's too far on the sweet end of the spectrum for my preferences. Very sippable and well worth trying, but I'm not sure I'd shell out for another bottle with the wealth of great imperial stouts out there. Constructively, the barrel and the base go well together only to a limited extent; I'm missing the seamless melting of barrel into base and true accentuating characteristics. And it does get a biteen dry on the finish, parching the palate somewhat.

Definitely some barrel qualities coming through(yay). There is some woodiness and a large sweet spirit presence. Love the apple going on. Some chocolate and roast from the beer comes through.
Really warming on the flavor with ample apple brandy and woody barrel. Chocolate, roast, and sweet.
Drinks so amazingly smooth. Mild carbonation and comes off almost full bodied. Ends a little dry. 
Saw a few people raving about this so I sucked it up and bought one and am glad I did. This rules. So easy to drink which ups the score for me. 594 charactersMattSweatshirt, Apr 01, 2015

The aroma hits of dark chocolate, cacao, dark fruit, and a spicy spirit fruit quality from the barrel.
The flavor follows with sweet chocolate, and apple and fruity sweetness. Then onto cacao bitterness, brandy sweetness, a touch of vanilla. The beer is smooth and rich throughout, yet also cleans up with a dry finish. 384 charactersdar482, Mar 27, 2015

This recipe creates  a chocolate chip kind of taste between the mouthfeel of the imperial stout, the apply brandy and the rest of the ingrediants. As the beer warms down, it gives away hints of wine like alcohol to it, from the brandy. It's all very nice. 296 charactersfloridadrift, Mar 26, 2015

Pours a very dark brown, almost black color, with one inch of dark tan head and low carbonation evident. Awesome gourmet chocolate, especially in the taste, and roasted malts, cocoa, toffee, Brandy, oak, toasted malts, and dark chocolate. Has a full body and low carbonation. No heat at all for 12%. Super smooth.
Overall I thought this was awesome. great nose, look, and mouthfeel, but the taste was the best part. Tastes of very high quality chocolate. Would love to have this again. 591 charactersmdfb79, Mar 26, 2015

Mouthfeel: good carbonation and just a slight bit of heat. 
Overall: A really solid stout that I could see myself drinking from time to time if it was available to do so. Prairie did a fine job with this one. 504 charactersTylertut, Mar 25, 2015

A: Black with a deep chocolate head. Extremely dark brown in the dimple. Just a slight lacing, with a hint of sheeting and the merest ghost of inkiness.
S: Never had Calvados before, but the whiff I get off the beer is quite intriguing! Very deep, dark barrel caramels. Some hard alcohol and fruity notes. Hint of tobacco. Burnt toffee. Sight apple seed. Delicious! I can't get over that smell. It's just wonderful!
T/MF: Very dark stout, here. The first taste is all char and graphite. It's still a touch cold, though. Some very dark chocolate, behind. Carbonation could be a little less, but the beer is still fairly luxurious on the tongue. I do get a bit of alcohol on the swallow, which holds onto the tongue, but not too much so. Sweeter black coffee and tobacco on the swallow, as well.
While this one really shines on the nose, it is quite tasty, as well, if a little dark. Makes me want to buy a bottle of Calvados to see if it compares favorably...
Actually, in thought, brandy and stout pair well, since both excel with a little warmth. In practice, this beer speaks favorably, too.
Poured from a 12 oz. bottle, into a Belgian tulip glass.
Edit: Brandy flavor comes through more as it warms. 1,306 charactersTruePerception, Mar 23, 2015

A: Black with some light coming through on the edges, mocha colored head, dissipated fairly quick, some lacing, looks viscous, looks good.
A: Things got weird here, an apple maple sweetness up front, picking up some slight chocolate aromas, not getting any of the barrel aromas but I am not sure what brandy is supposed to smell like, I don't drink brandy, but the apple is definitely there. 
T: Barrel and apple character up front, some nice chocolate notes in the middle, smooth finish, for 12%  the alcohol is well hidden.
M: Nice creamy mouthfeel, not a lot of carbonation on this, drinking really smooth.
O: Honestly, I'm a bit confused and thrown off by the apple brandy aromas and flavors, it has a really nice mouthfeel and appearance, but the apple brandy is not sitting well with my palate. I love barrel aged stouts  but I'm on the fence with this one. I want to love this beer but the apple brandy causes me to step back and reconsider. I really enjoy barrel aged stouts with chocolate and/or coffee added but apple brandy doesn't appeal to me. 1,111 charactersBrolo75, Mar 23, 2015

Smell:  Robust, and deep, with wafts of rich alcohol aromas.  Rich roasted malts, dark coffee roast, some dark chocolate.  Booze.   
Taste:  Nice desert drink.  I am happy I did not have any desert with dinner tonight.  The taste, imitates the smell.  Everything mentioned above is in the taste.  Sweetness and booziness.  I am looking for apple...I think I found some... 
Feel:  Medium to heavy feel.  Low carbonation.  Dense, low carb froth in the finish.
Overall -  Desert in a bottle.  This reminds me of chocolate liquors. 741 charactersmabermud, Mar 21, 2015

4.66/5  rDev +4.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours like a big stout should, thick and black with a small, 1 finger head. Good lacing and head retention overall. The smell is incredibly unique for a stout. Big, semi-acidic notes from the apple brandy up front with good fruit forward flavors. The booze of the barrel comes in next and in fairly strong on the nose. The fruitiness moves from initial apples to dark fruit in the middle of the scent and then the roasts of the stout kick in. At the back end the apples ramp back up to mix with the chocolate and dark roasts of the stout. Leaves you thinking fresh picked apple.
The taste of this is mellow and not as segmented as the scent was. Smooth dark flavors with just a touch of the apple hit the tongue right up front. The dark roasts and barrel mix quickly after the initial apple flavor and kind of give a caramel-vanilla-apple flavor impression. At the end of the drink the green apple flavor returns and lingers on the palate with the dark and burnt roasts intermingling a little. This beer is rather heavy on the tongue, like it should be, and smooth. The alcohol is only mildly detectable, and mostly in the warmth of the drink.
Overall, this is a superb beer. The apple brandy barrel adds a dimension that the Noir base needed. Compared to the red wine and vanilla versions of this beer, the apple brandy is a winner by a mile. 1,345 charactersboilermakerbrew, Mar 20, 2015

4.54/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured from the bottle into a snifter glass.
Deep walnut brown, a hint of red perhaps on the edges and comes out a little thin but fills with a creamy character in the glass.  Head is mocha and manages a bit of a finger tall, but settles to a creamy collar and some nice leopard spotting lacing and sheen on the edges.  Decent looker for a big stout.
Incredible well balanced and impressive bouquet.  Controlled heat and hardly boozy, fresh cut apples and dark chocolate.  Huge dark black forest cake fudge notes with apples taking over for cherry.  A little bit of vanilla cream mixes in nicely, even some coffee and everything just is so proportionally balanced and doesn't go over board.  Absolutely perfect with a wonderful fruit character that just shines excellently.
Palate after seems like a letdown but doesn't disappoint.  Hard to top that aroma but the mid palate is shaken a bit by a bit of a light bodied character even for barrel aging.  Comes off a little warmer than hinted on the nose in booze, but not in flavor.  Much of the fruit apple hits with excellent quality, and there's a pleasant bitterness in the aftertaste that either bounces from hop astringency but more like bitter roast hinting char.  Mid palate is loaded with thick dark chocolate and vanilla tones, even a bit of ground coffee sticks out just a hair.
Overall a real nice taker and slow sipper.  Absolutely killey nose and a memorable example of apple brandy aging if not the best one I've had to date. 1,492 characterssmakawhat, Mar 20, 2015

12 oz bottle, snifter
A – Jet black, but pours fairly quick, without much thickness or viscosity.  A half inch of brown, deep chocolate, head, somewhat bubbly with low retention.
S – Caramel, apples, chocolate, and vanilla.  The apple is of the candy variety (though not SOUR), and the caramel is sweet but very rich.  Malt is black but not roasty, just contributing dark or bittersweet chocolate aroma with a slight milkiness.  Vanillin from the barrel and some alcohol fruitiness are evident. 
T – Vanilla and semi-sweet chocolate lead here, with some smooth, rich caramel following.  Apple flavor is very mild here, contributing a touch of fruitiness along with what you’re getting from the alcohol.  Some high bitterness in the finish and aftertaste, not particularly pleasant. 
M – Low carbonation and medium-bodied.  A lot of sweetness up front with bitterness high on the end, and a bit of astringency.  Moderate alcohol warmth. 
O – Fantastic aroma profile and some nice flavors up front but the bitterness is somewhat unpleasant and mouthfeel does not measure up.  Good, but not great. 1,127 charactersinfinitebruner, Mar 16, 2015

S: Outstanding aroma! Chocolate pie, caramelized apple, toffee, toasted malt, some coffee and oak wood. Boozy
T: Lots of flavors in harmony. Baked apple, hints of molasses and honey, coffee, toasted malt, cacao, vanilla and oak
M:  As it warms on the palate, the alcohol comes through and leaves a pleasant mouthfeel. Lingering apple flavor. Rich and creamy
Overall: Dessert in a glass. This is a delicious stout, great for sipping. Love the label art too! 527 characterssjantiflow, Mar 14, 2015

4.55/5  rDev +2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75A:  Pours an opaque black color.  A two finger tan head slowly builds, with very good retention and lace.  Especially considering the strength.
S:  Caramelized apples are big and light wood up front.  Toasted malts, chocolate and vanilla, with a bit of coffee.  Really warm and inviting.  I can really plant my nose in the glass all day.
T:  That wonderful caramelized apple and wood up front again.  More stout comes through as this warms.  Toasted malts, milk chocolate, vanilla, and coffee and roast.  Everything intermingles perfectly and nothing stands out.  Everything is in check, from the sweetness, stout, and barrel character.  A warming treat.
M/0:  A big full body, but true to other monster Prairie stouts, it is not heavy at all.  Slightly sticky, but velvety smooth.  The alcohol is noticeable, but pleasantly warming.  Never over barring.  A real treat.
Who freaking cares about hype?  This is damn good, get that :)  As good as any of the Prairie stouts that I have had.  Which is saying something.  This hits all the marks, and really amazing.  Highly recommended. 1,083 characterschamp103, Mar 14, 2015

Appearance: Black as night some head at first but then it settles to virtually nothing.
Smell: Lots of vanilla and dried apple aromas. Dark fruits and dark malts. Amazing aroma.
Taste: Similar to the aroma lots of vanilla, apple brandy flavors and amazing blend of stout flavors. The taste is well balanced and the mouthfeel is spot on, very viscous and full flavored.
Overall: One of the better tasting stouts I have had in a long time! Very well made from one of the best breweries out there! 549 charactershumuloner22, Mar 13, 2015

4.04/5  rDev -9.4%look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4Bottle from Tipples poured to my Unibroue tulip. Pours thick and pitch black with a half finger of creamy mocha head on top. Aroma is big booziness, fudgy, ligiht roast, vanilla oak, sourish apples? Hmmm. Flavor follows with a nice roastiness, some chocolate, booze, brandy, molasses, alcohol, and finishes really long with lots of vanilla and oak. Rich body, light carbonation, slightly dry. This was pretty good, but somehow slightly bland at the same time. Seems well done, but I was hoping for a bit more here and the liquor flavors really seem to dominate any nuance from the beer itself. 593 charactersBMMillsy, Mar 08, 2015

Alcohol definitely present, but not overwhelming.  This a really sold sipper and probably Prairie's best offering to date. 379 charactersPliny_the_Self-righteous, Mar 07, 2015

Appearance: How surprising, it looks like a stout. Deep black/brown chocolate pour with a coffee milk head. Nice lacing and a persistent crown.
Smell: Lots of vanilla cream and green apple candy. Hints of chocolate and boozy brandy.
Taste: Tastes like pure unsweetened cream at first. When cold, this is all I taste. A bit of vanilla, very little apple even as it warms up, bit of brandy and booze. Bitter coffee finish.
Mouthfeel: Quite thick, but could be thicker. Slightly higher carb than I'd like.
Overall: Very good, but I've had many better apple brandy stouts. After reading the reviews I was expecting this to be pure apple brandy, but I'm just not getting it. I like that cream note though. 760 charactersWTKeene, Mar 07, 2015

Taste is led with a sweet milk chocolate, a bit of apple and cherry, and a slow brandy  burn as an aftertaste.

4.41/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25The beer pours a deep black with a dull tan halo of head around the perimeter. The nose is a potent mixture of tart apples, caramel, wood, chocolate and alcohol - it seems to scream apple brandy as it warms. Similarly, the AB barrel cuts right the malt base, to the point of inundating the palate with bright apples and spicy wood, followed by some malty  marshmallow-y sweetness in the finish. It's thick and chewy, saturated with barrel character, mildly carbonated, and does a reasonable job hiding the 12%abv. I prefer the wine barrel noir, but this beer's a very close second. 581 charactersThePorterSorter, Mar 06, 2015

Oak, brandy and dark malt flavors of the dominate the flavors with the oak being just a bit stronger. 
There is a some heat but otherwise a full bodied beer with a moderate level of carbonation. 
Boozy in a good way with lots of oak character and supporting flavors of roast and brandy. The base stout is solid but it plays a supporting role in the this beer. 467 charactersMadScientist, Mar 05, 2015

Pours an oily dark black, with a quarter inch head, and no lacing
Smells just rich decadent and awesome, wonderful sweet and rich apple brandy, deep earthy sweet chocolate, and a distinct cookie dough aroma. It smells chocolate chip studded cookie dough soaked in apple brandy. It smells so good.
This tastes amazing too. Big barrel character, tons of sweet apple brandy, with a good amount of oak, a little vanilla, and lots of cocoa powder. There's a bit of dark fruit and raisin flavor too. This one is pretty sweet, but there's a lot of roasty bitterness too on the back end that keeps everything balanced.
This is medium bodied, not super thick, but definitely not thin, with a lower level of carbonation.
This is one of the best barrel aged stouts I've ever had, and by far the best of the Noir series. 881 charactersGreesyFizeek, Mar 03, 2015

3.5/5  rDev -21.5%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 3.25Bottle I brought to share at Skuter's tasting.
Pours an opaque black with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa powder, apple brandy, and wood aromas. Taste is much the same with cocoa powder, cookie dough, green apple, apple brandy, earth, and wood flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roast and wood bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is an above average beer with an apple brandy barrel aged presence that clashes slightly with flavors in the base beer in my opinion.
Serving type: bottle. 754 charactersUCLABrewN84, Mar 01, 2015

Baking spice, chocolate, graham cracker, apple and oak.  Smells like the baking of a chocolate pastry.  Sadly the palate does not display the same richness.  A lot of bitter dark chocolate, some barrel.  Not a lot going on and thin to boot.

Pours black with amlost a full finger of khaki head. The froth recedes to a thin halo than leaves only a few small spots of lace. 
Big, rich nose of apple brandy. Cocoa, caramel, a fruity sweetness and hints of honey. I keep coming back to enjoy that terrific brandy aroma. 
Again in the taste that apple brandy is way up front along with bold dark chocolate. Coffee, fruit skin, caramel, brown sugar, oak, subtle earth and a dollop of alcohol. This is all about the barrel and I love it. The booze is understated for its 12% abv and the base stout seems to provide a chocolatey playground for all of that oaky apple brandy goodness. 
The body is on the fuller side of medium with carbonation that borders on overly rambunctious. Apple brandy dominance continues in the long aftertaste with complimentary notes of chocolate, oak and caramel. 
Apple Brandy Noir is a beautiful showcase for the barrel. It comes across as a dark chocolate filled with brandy and a hint of coffee. This is far and away my favorite of Prairie's Noirs that I've tried. Outstanding and worth a little effort to obtain. 1,204 charactersThickNStout, Feb 27, 2015

S: I don't know if this is the same base as wine barrel noir, but I was not a fan of the Wine Barrel Noir's smell. This is otherworldly, though. Rich and dense notes of spicy oak barrel, a good dose of sweet apple brandy with just a hint of heat, a little baker's chocolate. Maybe a touch of baked, caramelized pear as well. This smells amazing.
T: A rich, dark and downright gorgeous look at what barrel aging can do to a beer. Upfront, you get a good amount of the apple brandy, with just a touch of heat. Behind it, there's a great charred barrel note, some burned brownies, fudge, roasted malt and a dry, slightly boozy finish. Warms you up without wearing you out. Mouthfeel is medium and a touch slick, which is great because a heavier mouthfeel here would make this one rough. Great work here. 924 charactersnotchucknorris, Feb 27, 2015

Hugely disappointing flavor. Bland and borderline flavorless base stout. Chalky, powdery and dry as hell. Finishes with a nice brandy booziness though. 
Clearly I'm in the minority here. I liked the flavors that the brandy barrels contributed but the base stout is poorly crafted, IMO. I'd like to try this again as I'm baffled by the unanimous praise. Maybe I got a bad bottle? 475 charactersWolfsbaneBloom, Feb 25, 2015

Smells like crisp apples and raw cookie dough. Smells great. The apple aroma makes the cookie dough seem weird, or vice verse. 
Taste: really nice. Immediatly hit with a wave of a soft vanilla, then a crisp apple flavor kicks in and some prickly feel, followed by the cookie dough on the back end. 
Mouthfeel: medium, has a lightness to it, not too chewy. 
Overall: it's really nice. Not mind blowing but definitely a little interesting. Has some liquor and apple-like notes on the Aftertaste. 575 charactersraynmoon, Feb 22, 2015

Of all of the apple brandy aged beers I have had, this has the most pronounced apple character.  The apples are melded with a nice caramel and brandy note and followed up by a thick and delicious fudge.  The fudge is very heavy on the end and lingers nicely.  The taste matches the progression of the nose.  Apple, brandy, caramel, and fudge.  The finish is where this beer shines... nice complex notes of barrel char, chocolate, brownie batter, and apple just dance on the palate long after the sip.  This beer was a pleasant surprise.  I've enjoyed some of the other Noir variants and none of them wowed me like this.  Phenomenal. 716 charactershomebrew311, Feb 20, 2015

Backing off of the alcohol slightly and introducing a barrel aged charm, the new stout is roasty, toasty and robust as ever... but there's a twist.
Apple Brandy Noire is dark and ominous, drawing the ire of the most hardened drinker. It casts a delicate coffee-like creme of froth that casts strong aromatics of expected coffee, cocoa, campfire and walnut; however its spicy wine and wood notes are captivating.
Its roasty espresso flavors deeply side with coffee but carry and malty sweetness that seem of burn caramel, toffee and black-strap molasses. As the taste latches onto the middle palate, its sweetness shows reluctancy and the roast, spice and wood take hold. The taste concludes with smoky chocolate, tangy spice, blackberry and roasted currant.
Its full and brazen body engulfs the mouth with ease. High carbonation gives a dry marshmallow effect, but the tannic wood spice ensures a powdery texture and opens the window to showcase the high brandy spice. For a 12%-er, the stout is recklessly drinkable. 
Its barrel-aged character and vinous spice are dully noted, however there's little about the beer that suggests any calvados or apple brandy character otherwise. Yet, the beer is a beautifully woven taste young. I can't wait to see what two years do to it. 1,355 charactersBEERchitect, Feb 16, 2015

I've never had a beer aged in brandy barrels(tons of bourbon aged) before, so the smell right off the bat impressed me.  The brandy taste was also pleasing, and I could pick up a hint of the apple. I will be picking up more of this brew to see if apple notes become more prevalent once it has aged.  A great "noir" from Prairie Artisan Ales.

A: Black as night, little to no head at all. No real lacing on its way down.
S: I can't express how much I love the smell on this beer. Sweet, roasty, but you get a ton of apple and Carmel smell from it.  Sweet and fruity. I smell it and instantly think of fall.
T: Sweet, but not too overwhelming. Roasty but in the same sense as the sweetness.  The roasty burnt sugar and toffee mixed with coffee background. As far as barrel aging goes this beer shines. I can't recall a beer that does as well showing off what was in the barrel as this one, but not overpowering the base beer.
M: Great thickness, not too thin. Very good stuff. Coats the back of the mouth and sticks the flavor in there.
O: I love this beer. Maybe I'm being a bit fatigued from the Bourban and whiskey barrels that Many beers are aged in. Noir is a great beer, but when you put it in a fruity, dark, and sweet Liqour barrel like apple brandy it shines through. 974 charactersGerberr, Feb 15, 2015

A. Black with a small fine-bubble amber head that retreats to small rim. The fine carb leaves small spotty laces. Moderate viscosity.
S. The nose gets much more vibrant as it warms and the first notes that become apparent are cider, apples, raisins, and brandy. Next come raisin bread, cinnamon, brown sugar, and a hint of coco.
T. The taste is different than the nose and somehow an improvement. Very complex. Starts similar to a charred smoore. Then come waves of bread pudding, raisins, caramel, and coffee with 1/2 and 1/2. At the end comes a hoppy bitterness that balances the sweet notes to create a mildly bitter beer with great flavors.
M. Very smooth, silky, thick, medium carbonation, and a very full body. I throw booziness into feel, because it is not a taste, but more of a feel that sits in my cheeks after I take a sip.
O. Damn they did it again. Coming off the heels of the Pirate BOMB! they bring a barrel-aged stout with a different base, but with all the complexities and dynamic flavors of it's predecessor. While the flavors are certainly different than BOMB!, they very much work. Not knowing much about this before I had it, I was overly impressed and I fully stand behind my high rating. 1,265 charactersmacher0, Feb 14, 2015

L: About as dark as it gets, no light coming through this one. A hard pour produces next to no head, what head is there is a nice tan looking color. 
S: WHOA! boozy! Caramel apple was a perfect good description, chocolate, cognac/brandy, grapes, maybe a hint of vanilla? 
T: This is great! Lots and lots of brandy up front, the good stuff, vsop, leaning toward cognac. Green apple fades into a slight burn from the alcohol, in the most pleasant way.
M: Thick, syrupy, little carbonation. Just how i like it.
O: I'll be going back tomorrow early hoping to snag 2 more (and make like a master of disguise to defeat the bottle limit). Worth having a few more to share with people who deserve it! 745 charactersSackBlabbath, Feb 14, 2015

 - 12 oz. bottle poured into Lost Abbey Teku on 13-Feb-15
Great nose! Aromas of chocolate, caramel, cake batter, and brandy all balanced in a velvety mixture. Flavors of chocolate, brandy, oak, nice dose of apples, and a little more booze than I'd like. The sweetness at the end can get quite cloying. 
Overall, this is on par with the other Prairie stouts I've tasted and doesn't disappoint. 409 charactersRollzroyce21, Feb 14, 2015

Reeks of a boozy caramel apple, but in a good way! One of the best smelling brews I've ever had. Apple, caramel, heavy alcohol, chocolate, roasted malt, and some spice.
The apple certainly falls off when it comes to flavor, but still present as well as a heavy caramel, roasted almost burnt malt aspect, dark chocolate, and a slight presence of cinnamon.
Heavy-bodied, low carbonation, sweet at first, dry finish, but just unfortunately thin for my taste.
Overall, this is hands down the best smelling beer I've ever had and flavor isn't bad either, but the thinness and loss of apple flavor degraded overall appeal. 721 characterslarryarms847, Feb 13, 2015

A: Slightly translucent black with a thin, rust-colored head
S: Fantastic aromas of vanilla, Hershey's chocolate syrup, brandy, and a blend of mildly tart apples and cherries. Loved the muted wafts of brandy, which come across almost like a creme brûlée-ish sugary vanilla.
T: Delicious. A lot like those chocolate candies with a booze-soaked cherry inside. Lots of cocoa, vanilla, cherries, and brandy. Nice, mild roasted cocoa or coffee beans on the finish. Not getting much in the way of apple; the main flavor is milky, brandy-soaked cocoa.
M: The mouthfeel isn't "thin," but I think a bit more heft would send this beer to the next level. As is, however, the mouthfeel is light, slightly syrupy, and a great conveyor belt for the flavors.
O: A delicious beer that I'd be glad to drink on a regular basis. That said, I think this beer would benefit from a slightly more substantial mouthfeel and a more pronounced apple-brandy flavor. The brandy really shines on the nose and in the taste, but I was left wondering where the apple in the apple-brandy barrel was. 1,118 charactersblankenhoney, Feb 08, 2015

A: Pours black with a thin brown head. Some lacing.
S: Strong brandy smell gives way to molasses, dark chocolate, and apple, of course.
T: Again, lots of brandy giving way to all the flavors described above, plus subdued barrel notes. There is a little heat but it should mellow with time. Definitely best quaffed at around 55 degrees or warmer.
M: Full bodied, smooth and creamy.
O: Likely to taste even better with a few months on it, this beer drinking mighty fine fresh. Dessert in a glass but not at all cloying. 579 charactersBrosephMansino, Feb 06, 2015

4.59/5  rDev +2.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I was lucky enough to score a few bottles of PAA Apple Brandy Noir in my little home town of Ponca City, Oklahoma thanks to Sharon, owner of Plaza Wine and Spirits.
Visually, ABN is similar to the other variants of the Noir line - deep black/brown capped with a single finger of mocha colored foam that simmers down to a ring at the edge of the tulip glass.  Lace is very drawn out with large gaping holes down to the last drop.
The aroma - wow!  Sweet apple brandy heaven!  Like a fresh dipped hot caramel apple with a ton of buttery vanilla and sweet booze backed by tinges of light chocolate.  An easy 5.
The flavors of the brandy are more predominant when chilled while the chocolate and vanilla are more striking after warming with alcohol coming up to strength.  The apple remains from start to finish.  Very nice.
Silky smooth decadent feel with full body as expected.
Overall, this is great.  Maybe the best Noir yet.  Can't wait to see what it's like at the 6 and 12 month marks.  Cheers! 1,002 charactersDelMontiac, Feb 03, 2015

4.56/5  rDev +2.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5A thin tan head quickly develops and just as quickly disappears at the end of the pour.  Color is black with crimson hues.
The aromas, in order of appearance, are apple, cinnamon, rich chocolate cake, vanilla and taffy, and all make for an all-star cast. 
Tastes like chocolate cake drenched in brandy, apple and cinnamon.  There is nothing more to discuss. 
All I can say is sip this one of a kind until there's no tomorrow. 431 charactersstephens101, Jan 31, 2015

4.84/5  rDev +8.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Appearance- Color is black and for the pour pretty much no head is produced.  A little bit of mocha colored carbonation fizzles to the top, but never forming a head.
Aroma- The barrel qualities definitely come through in the nose with alot of sweet vanilla/boozy/oak aromas. Dark chocolate is noticeable too.
Taste- The booze and barrel qualities on this are huge.  First sip shows a tone of that boozy, oak, and vanilla flavors followed by sweet milk chocolate and slightly roasty/bitter finish.  No alcohol heat/burn from this, but theres definitely alot of boozy flavors and a little bit of alcohol warmth.  As far as the apple part of this they're pretty subtle, but definitely add to the initial sweetness and come out more as it warms.  
Feel- As with some of prairie stouts this is on the lighter side of full bodied, very low in carbonation, and pretty clean in the finish for a stout.  
Overall- The brandy barrel flavor on this beer is really big in the nose and taste.  The finish and body definitely leave something to be had though, so i can't quite put it up with the best barrel aged stouts I've had.  But I really wish I had gotten more than one of these as it's definitely one of prairie best stouts and it needs to be made again. Highly recommend this, and it's well worth the $10 price tag.
Note: Been aging for this about two years and its aged nicely.  The aroma is a little muted, but the feel has definitely thickened up into a fuller/chewier feel.  The taste is amazing with fudge, vanilla, dark fruit, and a little barrel booziness still coming through. 1,583 charactersCTbrew32, Jan 27, 2015

4.4/5  rDev -1.3%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5One of my favorite stouts (so far) from Prairie. Nose is warm and inviting, with notes of molasses, fudge, wet oak, and - surprisingly - a heavy amount of stewed apples. I didn't expect such a prominent fruit aroma from the calvados, but it's there in force. On the palate, the brandy is also front-and-center, but with less of that fresh apple character; the flavors come across more as a rounded, steady blend of ashy barrel wood, vanilla cream frosting, caramel, and baked, thick-skinned apples. Each sip is wrapped up in the sweet, sticky booziness you can only get with brandy, with the mouthfeel to match. Incredible; the barrel-aging really has changed this beer to its core. Now it's absolutely dripping with apple brandy flavor.
Indisputable evidence that the barrel can certainly make the beer - I've had Wine Barrel Noir and this is in a completely different ballpark. Bravo Prairie! 895 charactersBarryMFBurton, Jan 24, 2015
4.34/5  rDev -2.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Pours a thick blackish brown from the bottle with only the slightest mocha head. Smells of chocolate, sweet brandy and red delicious apple. Tastes of brandy, chocolate, apples and vanilla. It's definitely boozy, but very creamy. Medium mouth that's a touch chewy. I really like how Prairie lets the barrel-aged taste come through without it being overpowering. Anxious to see what this tastes like a few months down the line. It's pretty darn good now. 452 charactersMartzMimic, Jan 23, 2015
