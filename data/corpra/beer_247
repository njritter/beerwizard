4.17/5  rDev -5%look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Just a wonderfully smooth and drinkable beer. 100% likeable and I would buy ''tis beer again and again.   I just wish sometimes that HillF beers were much more available but HF has a plan and are sticking to it for the long term.  I admire that self control and look forward to being in parts of Vermont that carry some of their beers on draft and, of course, my no where as many pilgrimages as I would like to HF. 414 charactersNewbeergeek1, May 08, 2017

4.22/5  rDev -3.9%look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25Had it on tap at Beer Shop NYC. 
Pours a wonderfully hazy golden orange color with a fingernail length head and good lace retention.
In the nose there are light citrusy and pine aromas.
In the mouth it is light and easy drinking with a gentle carbonation. Although many of the flavors are clean at first, as it warms, lots of light tropical fruit notes come out; grapefruit, mango, papaya and pear. The malt flavor is crackery and semi sweet. The pine is modest and not overwhelming.
Lovely example of an American pale ale that is easy to put away. I could have several of these. 579 charactersGajo74, Apr 02, 2017

Pours a hazy orange.
The smell is crisp and tropical, pineapple, mango, you namit, it's in here.
Crisp taste, all of the fruit elements from the nose are here, followed by along, soft bitterness. Just outstanding stuff.
Refreshing mouthfeel, sharp carbonation. Would be a superb palate cleanser, I believe.
This was one of the beers I most looked forward to having, and oh yes, it lives up to the hype. Just a superb Pale Ale. 568 charactersJamFuel, Mar 14, 2017

Pours a night light golden colour with some mild cloudiness; a decent look with as much head as you like on a hard  pour & some minor lacing.  Bright citrus/pine/floral hops with a touch of something else (melon/tangerine) - very nice taste well balanced by malts & having a medium smooth feel.  Just a great tasting solid beer with quite a bit of pleasant flavour & nothing harsh on the finish.

on tap @ Hen of the Wood, Burlington, VT on 4 June 2016
Notes: Slightly hazy orange-gold or "peach" body beneath a creamy head of white foam. Very good head retention and lacing. Aroma is hoppy with notes of citrus, grass, and pine over a delicate biscuity malt base. The flavor follows with a pleasant balance between the delicate malt, the moderate hops, and a solid bitterness. Hill Farmstead is all about the malt, and this one is no exception. It's not full in body, it's just medium, but the malt has a richness of character to it. They must be using a quality malt, and properly mashing and sparging, otherwise it wouldn't have the noticeable character that it does. And it's surprising, overall, that Hill Farmstead beers are so appreciated because, really, they go against the grain in today's beer society where bigger is always better, and even if it's smaller it should hit you over the head - Hill Farmstead beers don't do that. So what else of it? Just the balance I'd say. The malt is balanced, the hops are balanced, and the bitterness is balanced. It's very drinkable, which, I just thought of it, is exactly what Sierra Nevada is, what makes it great, and that's the originator so why not follow in their footsteps? Nicely done. 1,278 charactersNeroFiddled, Oct 05, 2016

S: Citrusy hops, mainly lemon and grapefruit
T: Follows the nose, with a lot of citrus hitting the palate right away. Lemons, grapefruit pith and even limes. Hint of earthy spice reminds me of rye at times. Modest bread doughy malt provides balance and a jumping off point for tthe citrusy hop characteristics. There's a lot of hop flavor packed into this APA.
M: It's a little on the thin side; carbonation is quite active and a little bit sharp. But I think that active carbonation actually enhances the flavor's vibrancy. 
O: Quite good; reminds me of a session IPA in many ways, with a very light heft and feel but big time citrusy hops. 810 charactersKendo, Oct 04, 2016

May be the best pale ale I've ever had.  Deep yellow-orange hazy with feathery smooth foam-head.  Packs an incredible amount of citrus orange flavor into a 5.2% abv brew.  If I didn't know any, I would have guessed this is was a robust IPA and not a 'light' PA.  Smooth and easy drinking finish.  Something to be enjoyed all day. 358 characterseifster82, Sep 28, 2016

The smell is grapefruit orange and pineapple, and the taste replicates the smells.  It is smooth, refreshing with a slight bitterness on the back end.  The mouthfeel was unexpectedly smooth yet had some body and reminded me a little of the tannins in a good dry red wine.  Overall, my first pilgrimage to Hill Farmstead Brewery did not disappoint, and this pale ale is the best I have tasted to date. 532 charactersDoubleMalt, Jul 31, 2016

It pours a light gold color with an off white head. Nice carbonation. Aroma is nice, but not in your face. Smells of citrus with some grassy and some pine in there as well. Taste is very smooth with great citrus pine hop character. Mouthfeel is medium. This is a solid brew. Not the type of brew that's going to knock your socks off or fatigue your palate. This is the type of pale ale you will go back to again and again. 591 charactersdaudelin2000, Jul 17, 2016

I detect light wheat, biscuit, and lemon.
Being my first Hill Farmstead pale ale, it is becoming very clear to me that balance is the focus here, with the malt, yeast and hops all working together to make a very pleasant, easy drinking beverage.
Edward is just ultra-smooth and well executed. Refined through and through with no bitterness, and a semi-dry finish. There is also a delicate farmhouse yeast that keeps this grounded and earthy.
When we were in Boston, we had a growler of Alter Ego from Tree House. It had been a long day and we didn't end up actually finishing it before zonking out. In the morning, we took the leftover beer and poured it into a glass with some fresh, cold orange juice, then plopped some fresh pineapple, orange and grapefruit into the concoction. Cutting to the chase, Edward reminded us of that beermosa. Considering Edward is not a juice-bomb, this says something about its balance in that fresh fruit does not necessarily impart overpowering sweetness, and does often have an earthy quality to it. The quest for juicier and juicier IPAs must be checked at some point, and looking back at well crafted beers like this is not a bad idea to keep brewers from going into Tang territory. 1,286 charactersSabtos, Jul 10, 2016

S: Sweet, honey like malts and tropical fruit notes.  Maybe a tiny touch of dankness.
T: Malts are interesting, sweet with an almost corn like graininess.  A touch of bitterness but very well balanced.  Tropical notes mesh well with sweetness and make for a great drinking experience.  But overall flavors are expertly balanced on the palate and the drink is very smooth and drinkable.
F: Body is smooth and full yet not at all heavy.  Very frothy and cream like.  Carbonation is medium and balances well with the bitter hop notes.
O: Really enjoyable, flavors more on the mild side, reminding you of their presence without being overbearing and having no balance.  Great pale ale. 767 charactersedward_boumil, Jun 13, 2016

The beer had an incredible murky thick orange appearance and a thick bubbly head that only dissipated slightly throughout my time drinking it. The beer had one of the sharpest orange peel-citrus flavors I personally have had. The aromas were dense and floral. Taste follows the nose with that sweetness from the orange-citrus really coming through. The carbonation to this beer was great as well; excellently crisp and refreshing. Overall, a fantastic drink across all dimensions. 541 charactersfitzy84, Jun 04, 2016

Tongue is much the same, the citrus lemon is very precise and elegant, blended in very well with the main beer notes. Very easy finish, and an excellent, more subtle pale ale. 250 charactersajm5108, May 29, 2016

Probably gets a lower score from many than Abner, Susan and other HF beers because of the moderate ABV, but the look, taste and feel of Edward are all on par with, if not better. It's an insult to call a beer this great "sessionable," but if it weren't so prohibitively expensive, I couldn't think of anything better than to have an endless supply of this on a breezy summer day.

4.1/5  rDev -6.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25On tap at Pony Bar. From notes. Reviewed 28 January 2016.
4/4/4/4.5/4.25
Hazy brown-yellow pale. 
Smells traditionally Americanly hoppy. Pine and citrus zest. 
It tastes vaguely bubble gummy (Sorachi Ace?) and very vegetal with heavy citrus note. Long, heavy flavor is a bit murky. Thick-bodied for such a light beer and packed with flavor. 
Recommended, certainly, but not exceptional. Solid pale ale devoid of flaws.
23 September 2016 EDIT:
On tap at Blind Tiger in a tulip. 
4/3.5/4/3.75/4.25
Hazy mud orange with a finger of tight, creamy head. 
Smells subtly, but pleasantly hoppy. Lots of orange, hint of onion. 
It tastes unassuming. It's fine. A solid IPA in modern parlance. Hint of more exotic fruit (guava) with some tart citrus, lots of dirt and earth, and a clean malty finish. Drinks easily, if rather unbalanced (lots of hops). Citrus peel dominates. 866 charactersAgentMunky, Mar 12, 2016

Looks wise has a short head and great lasting lacing. Earthy, mossy aroma followed by a dank resin. Delightful first taste of an evergreen forest with overtones of an orange orchard. Rounds out with a smooth, caramel like finish. Overall, a fav. 321 charactersLaurenPreston, Feb 28, 2016

4.4/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25On draft at Pomodoro in downtown Burlington.  Served in a tulip alongside a fantastic pasta dish.  A fairly hazy light yellow-orange color with a soft finger of bubbles, which sticks around and leaves big lace on the glass.  Aroma is not too distinct, but features some citrus and pine.  Taste is very nice, a very fine example of pale ale.  Mouth is just about perfect, medium-body, smooth, creamy, nicely carbed, super easy to drink.  Overall, a great pale ale from Hill Farmstead. 483 charactersFFreak, Feb 26, 2016

4.57/5  rDev +4.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5On tap at Pony Bar, NYC; pours very hazy gold orange color with a small off white head that faded and left excellent foamy lacing and rings as it went down.
Wow, is this really an APA as it smells and tastes like an extremely fresh hopped IPA. Dank and pungent, the nose reeks of citrus and tropical fruit with a nearly perfect mix of lemon zest, grapefruit, pineapple, oranges, papaya, resiny piney hops, herbs, mild pepper spices, graham cracker, pizza crust and some floral notes. It's hop dominant yet masterfully balanced with a kiss of bitterness. Delicious and sessionable.
This was fantastic and lived up to the hype. Hope it comes down to this area more often as I will seek this out. 695 charactersCHickman, Jan 28, 2016

3.85/5  rDev -12.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.75This is a light IPA at less than 6%. It has a smooth and soft mouth feel with very little carbonation. Tastes of lemon, lime, and grapefruit with floral notes. Basil and orange peel come through on the finish. Its a nice IPA, but certainly not worth the price to acquire if you are outside of New England. 305 charactersdanh53, Jan 24, 2016

Smell is a bit muted, but I pick up grapefruit, pine and a little lemon. Taste is similar, with a bit of breadiness coming in occasionally. Nice lingering pleasant bitterness. Feel is stellar--smooth and soft, yet balanced by perfect carbonation. Overall, an outstanding pale ale that doesn't shout, but speaks quietly with convincing eloquence. 447 charactersBeers-es, Jan 06, 2016

Had on-tap@ La Puerta Negra in Montpelier, VT
Appearance - Served up in a tall pint, the brew is cloudy and dull orange in color with an off-white, half finger width head. Fair retention, breaking down to a thin layer of surface suds. Lacing comes in the form of broken sheets and a few spots between. 
Smell - Pungent, juicy orange aroma with distant, zingy pineapple. 
Taste - Doesn't quite deliver on the strength that the nose promised. Hits first on moderate orange notes, balanced by a near equal bready malt sweetness. Faint pineapple acidity creeps in near the finish, then a lingering citrus pith bitterness. 
Mouthfeel - Medium in body with moderate carbonation. Smooth, silky quality lends itself to a stupid ease of drink.
Overall - This is a fantastic pale ale, but if I'm being frank the flavor profile leaves a bit to be desired. It does well to balance between the hops and malts, and it goes down as easy as they come. It's a bit of a shame that HFS has such limited visiting hours; it would have been nice to have visited their brewhouse my one night in town, but I suppose getting to try their brews on tap will have to suffice. 1,191 charactersTheSixthRing, Dec 07, 2015

Hazy yellow with 2 finger head. 
Hops and citrus upfront with a bit of sweetness in the end of the nose. 
Nice citrus, lemon and pine notes. A bit of malt adds a bit of sweetness on the finish. Very delicious. 
Super delicious pale ale, boarders the line of IPA in my opinion. 349 charactersDopen993, Nov 23, 2015

4.61/5  rDev +5%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5750ml growler filled yesterday. Thanks Alex :)
A: Pours a cloudy pale gold. Enormous frothy off-white head. Head retention is absolutely top-notch as it almost doesn't move at all. Easy five minutes before it has settled enough to drink. Heavy lacing to boot.
S: Oh yeah. Fresh, pungent and juicy. Lots of citrus - oranges specifically. Very light pine. A pleasure just to smell it.
T: Lots of floral hops up front with plenty of citrus backing. Spicy pine kicks in in the middle. The hop flavors don't so much as meld together as they have distinct starting and ending points. Very interesting. And delicious. Light grainy malt helps sweeten it up just enough. Mild wave of bitterness and then a crisp finish with lingering floral hops primarily. Very little aftertaste, just sort of a lingering grainy bitterness. 
M: Surprisingly heavy bodied for 5.2%. I assume the unfiltered nature has given it a little more heft? Hard to say, it is shockingly heavy and silky smooth to boot. A little lower carbonation helps the mouthfeel too I think.
O: One hell of an APA. I've had most of the top 10 APAs on this site (currently anyway) and this one is right up there. It might just be the best of them. The mouthfeel especially is a notch above, so full and smooth it really makes this incredibly drinkable - further enhancing the APA character. Ridiculously good, on a level that I didn't even realize was possibly. Having said all of that, how could I give it anything but a 5 here? 1,483 charactersDope, Nov 08, 2015

Beautiful creamy head. Good retention through the first half. Sour/sweet clean smell. Smooth and remarkably balanced. No one flavor stands out from the sweet front end to the bitter hops on the end.

Pours a hazy amber/orange color with a small head that leaves great lacing. Smell is juicy and pure hops, lots of citrus swirling around. BAM! Instant orange flesh and malt sweetness in the flavor. Hop oils and bitterness in the back give off some herbal qualities and some grapefruit rind. Never gets too malty and never gets too bitter. Just a total orange juice bomb with a light body and delicate carbonation. Easily one of my favorite pale ales now, world-class. 532 charactersBranfordBound, Sep 30, 2015

S - Citrus in the form of grapefruit zest and pith.  Slight spiciness underneath.
T - Powerful citrus up front, with bright flash of orange and grapefruit.  Middle brings some pine and light malt elements, a subtle sweetness that fades quickly into a more bitter close.  Nothing extreme, but definitely present.
M - Bright and carbonated, with mild drying in the close.
O - One of the best APAs I've had.  This delivers a full blast of citrus notes and definite bitter elements while keeping it all together.  Clean, precise and exacting, this is what you hope for in a craft beer.  Exceptional. 752 charactersTsar_Riga, Jul 10, 2015

Holy Crap, this is a great pale ale.  I enjoyed it so much more than their experimental beers, Conduct of Life, Excursions. Double citra ,and Society and Solitude.
Pors a hazy orange with two fingers of bone white head. 
Smells of dank and fruity hops.
Great malt backbone with dank and fruity hops dominating.
Don'underestimate the value of their fantastic water.  
This would be my go to beer, but I live in Pittsburgh. 530 charactersgcasher, Jun 25, 2015

This is a beautiful hazy orange color and smells slightly more malty than expected but in case it's welcomed, awesomely juicy and at the same time earthy and pine come through.
Taste leaves something to be desired, full bodied and not fair because I had it just after Double Citra (which knocked my socks off) 
The pine tastes like home but this is better because of how well HF is able to balance the usually harsh bitters.  This is legit, definitely an amazing brew. 572 charactersM_chav, Jun 09, 2015

4.5/5  rDev +2.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5On tap at Worthy Burger in Royalton:
Appearance: pours a very hazy, pinkish orange body, with a thick, fluffy white head. Lots of retention, and thick, sudsy lacing at each level of the beer as its drunk.
Aroma: piney, with a lot of the rind scent from citrus. Got a little bit of pineapple, in addition to tons of citrusy zest and rind. Very, very pungent and fresh smelling. Could smell it being poured six feet away from the tap.
Taste: following the smell, it starts with medium bitterness and piney dankness, followed by tropical fruitiness and citrus rind. It's a bright, NE style pale, and that might disappoint someone looking for malty balance or a more English style pale.
Feel: light to medium body, with mild carbonation. Leaves sticky, lingering hoppiness.
Overall: a very delicious, hoppy pale ale. I'd drink this beer any day. 846 charactersTheElectricOne, Jun 02, 2015

It was still a decent pale ale but I had been lead to believe differently, I hope the other Vermont beers I get to try are better or live up to their ratings more so.  We'll see if this was an old keg or whatever OR if Vermonters like to pad the homeboys brews, the latter would be so disappointing. 440 charactersLXIXME, May 31, 2015

4.17/5  rDev -5%look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Poured a very cloudy golden color with a thin head.
Very fresh hops to smell; not as overwhelmingly grassy as many others are - perhaps a smokey quality to them?  Very different and refreshing.  
Taste follows the scent; overall quite hoppy, but with a dry, almost citrusy finish.  
Mouthfeel is just right for this beer; not too light but not too heavy either, perfect balance in the middle.  Carbonation is the same.
Overall a great APA, as is to be expected from Hill Farmstead, though it is a touch strong on the hops.
Personal note - first had this beer at Farmhouse Tap and Grill in Burlington with mother at their 2015 Hill Farmstead/Grassroots event. 663 charactersyouth-and-art, Apr 25, 2015

M: [3.75] Carbonation is just right.  Not cloying or bitter.  Clean finish.
O: [3.75] Really nice beer.  This was my first Hill Farmstead beer.  Maybe I was expecting unicorns with rainbows shooting out of them.  But this didn't totally blow me away.  This was a solid beer but did not overwhelm me. 557 charactersfscottkey, Apr 08, 2015

4.43/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5On tap at the Worthy Burger. Despite living in neighboring NH, I've been waiting a long time for this. A cloudy pumpkin pour with a thick frothy head that died down quickly, but left excellent lacing throughout the glass. An almost smokey hoppiness on the nose. Big herbal fruity hop flavor; how did they pack all that in an Pale Ale? A strong bitter pop, especially late. The carbonation seems right on, and there is a creaminess to this one, a pleasure to drink. I often forgot I wasn't drinking an IPA because it left me wanting nothing more, like some APAs can. With the possible exception of Zombie Dust (boy would I love to test them side-by-side!) this is easily the best APA I've tasted. 695 characterstheIPAman, Apr 05, 2015

I love the Stoneface and Peeper...  but have to put this higher in the pecking order of APAs. I feel bad... had this after an Abner... and didn't get to really clean out my taste buds before this one. At a low 5% with the flavor you get... outstanding. EFB just has the magic touch... but like all their brews... just so hard to get your hands on... which in my opinion... goes to my sense of "feel." 442 charactersfulcrumbs, Apr 02, 2015
4.48/5  rDev +2.1%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Hazy opague amber orange much like Abner and similar fruitiness but with a much much lighter mouthfeel.  Unlike any other pale ales that I've had and very very VERY crushable and enjoyable.  Nose of any and all citrus fruits (particularly orange and mango).  Great beer to pair with food as it's so light in texture yet rustic and flavorful.  This is a all day on a boat in the hot sun kind of beer at 5.2% and one of the best pales I've ever had.  I'd put the Fort Point Pales from Trillium ahead of this but otherwise it's right up there. 540 charactersHopDeezy, Apr 02, 2015

A:  Wow, how murky is this beer?  Super murky and cloudy with a one finger white head.  Nice full glass lacing that sticks.
S:  Tons of citrus, floral and slight pine smells with some caramel sweetness.  Nice.
T:  The hops are really jumping.  Loads of floral herbal flavors, tons of grapefruit, tangerine, some pineapple, peach and pear.  The malt shines through the middle with some caramel sweetness, but the huge hops pound it down so it does not overcome the hops.  Slight pine bitterness at the finish and a super clean but lasting finish.  Wonderful.
MF:  Just perfect.  Medium, a bit prickly and bitter but still creamy somehow.  No alcohol and just super drinkable.
O:  This is one kick ass pale ale, probably the best I have ever had.  There is a reason this is the "grandaddy" of HF, it is deserving.  Everything you want in a pale ale, and even more.  This beer is a thing of beauty.  Awesome. 984 charactersKadonny, Mar 12, 2015

Aroma is like a floral bouquet with light citrus and pine. Malts hold up well. Nice delicate mix. Flavor is sweet and sharply citrus initially, twhen turns to spicy and herbal. A lot of deliciousness to take in. Texture is smooth but loaded with prickly carbonation, subtle dryness, and slight hop resin grittiness. This is a great beer to have a growler of. It's got a distinct Hill Farmstead taste to it. Very fresh, hoppy, herbal, and spicy. A very likable beer. 550 characterstastybeer, Jan 04, 2015

Pours an orange amber color.  Very hazy with a creamy white head and good lacing.
Smells delicious!  Very juicy with lots of tangerine, grapefruit and tropical fruit.
Flavor follows the nose with an amazing citrus profile that gives way to just a touch of malt sweetness with a nice crisp bitterness on the finish.  Really nicely balanced.
Medium body with moderate carbonation.  Lots of resinous hop oils contribute to a dry finish that demands the next sip!
Overall, this is a fantastic beer.  Exceptional balance and great hop flavor.  I was very sad to see the last of it in my glass. 645 charactersmr-jj, Oct 27, 2014

4.64/5  rDev +5.7%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Poured from a brewery-filled growler into a US tumbler pint glass.
A: The beer is a deep gold color, with a large off-white head that fades slowly and leaves a thick lace on the glass.
S: The aroma contains fruity citrus, caramelized malts and grassy hops.
T: The taste starts out with sweet flavors of citrus and caramel. Then a strong but not over-powering hops presence comes in. The malt character is hearty but not too heavy and brings an excellent balance. The after-taste is slightly sweet and slightly hoppy.
M: Crisp and very smooth, medium body, medium carbonation, finish is clean.
O: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not too filling, mild kick, excellent representation of style, this is a great beer to pound down for a very long time. 756 charactersTheManiacalOne, Oct 26, 2014

A: Burnt orange to medium amber with some honey and golden highlights - pours with a big, white head, keeps a wispy cap, leaves some nice streaks of lacing 
S: Excellently balanced citrus, pine, and pale malts - not particularly intense, but intensely balanced - fresh, ripe orange, tangerine, and grapefruit - fleshy and floral citrus - pine needles with a hint or resin and dank notes - clean, pale malts with a touch of caramel
T: Balanced, clean, stupidly drinkable - nice level of citrus, with some orange, tangerine, and ruby red grapefruit flavors - very floral - pine, with some resin, some hints of mint - pale malts, with  a touch of caramel - grainy bread - medium level of bitterness- extremely clean and drinkable
M: On the light side of medium, nicely carbonated, smooth, finishes somewhat dry
O: Superior to Robert Pattinson
Hill Farmstead makes absurdly clean beers. That being said, this is one of the cleanest, which really shines in an American Pale Ale. Worth the drive. 1,056 charactersangrybabboon, Oct 25, 2014

5/5  rDev +13.9%Edward pours a hazy pale orange with a one finger head with decent retention.
Smells like wonderful citrus hops. Some grapefruit of course, but it's more complex than that by a lot. Hill uses 5 different hops in Edward, and it shows both on the nose and in the taste.
Taste follows the nose - lots of citrus and tropical fruit, plus some grassy notes and a little pine bite mixed with light sweetness from the caramel malts. The finish is very slightly bitter - the 85 IBUs is very misleading as are IBU listings for all of Hills Beers.
Mourthfeel - Something about Hill Farmstead Water gives all of their beers an amazing mouth. It's soft, smooth, and nicely carbonated.
Edward is just about the perfect Pale Ale. I'd need to drink more of it, and drink it side by side with Trillium Fort Point and Zombie Dust to say which one i like the best, but you really can't go wrong with any of those three APAs. 909 charactersRichKent, Oct 23, 2014

5/5  rDev +13.9%Wow, this really is outstanding beer!
Four and a half days after making the pilgrimage to Hill Farmstead I opened up my 750ml bottle of Edward and poured myself a glass. Words can barely describe how well all of the flavors go together. 
Like a more hearty saison, this American Pale Ale is a league and a half above anything else in it's class. Moderately hopped, oh so freaking smooth. This beer really is amazing stuff.
I never had the pleasure of meeting Edward, the beer's namesake, but if someone made a beer half as good as this in my name I'd be leaving quite a legacy.
If you can get some of this, please, do so. I can't imagine you would be disappointed. 668 charactersMarcGetty, Oct 16, 2014

A - Hazy pour, nice light copper/orange color with a white head. Head diminished pretty quickly after a minute or two. 
S - Fresh and crisp with citrus notes that definitely hint to an ensuing bitter taste. 
T - Nice upfront bite that provides that citrus flavor and bitterness, and mellows off to a crispy hop flavor. Pleasant aftertaste.
M - Well carbonated, fairly light and fresh feel to it. 
O - Really enjoyed the refreshing nature of the citrus and light feel, which accompanied by the 5.2% ABV,  provides a great experience beyond that first beer! 604 charactersRusseLloyd, Oct 10, 2014

Pours a hazy, cloudy creamy orange body with a white frothy head that reduces quickly to leave some lacing and little retention.
Aromas of pine, flowers, ask me citrus, grapefruit shine though.
On the tongue huge floral notes stand out, light caramel, pine, and citrus on the follow through. Medium light body and medium carbonation, very easy drinker.
This pale ale is no doubt world class, smooth, and balanced: a great start to those who are looking to get into hoppy beers, as well as an excellent session beer for the seasoned craft beer drinkers. 653 charactersgcamparone, Sep 20, 2014

4.34/5  rDev -1.1%Appearance: It has a nice nice murky golden/orange color to it. It has a nice off-white head that dies down moderately and leaves some nice lacing.
Smell: The aromas definitely give out hints of pine resins, citrus, loads of grapefruit and sweet bready malts. 
Taste: Like the aromas, it has loads of grapefruit, citrus, a nice piney bitterness, light grass and some sweet bready malts. 
Mouthfeel: It has a low/med carbonation with a very nice overall balance and feel. 
Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied by great flavors and aromas. Another great beer from Hill Farmstead.

The taste is also tropical, lots of pith, pine, pineapple, papaya. The taste is very fruity and hoppy. Nice pine, resin, mild tropical punch, light citrus. Refreshing take on a pale. Light body, light to medium carbonation, slightly drying hop finish. Overall, this is a great brew, thx to K0IZ for the pickup. 400 charactersStinkypuss, Aug 06, 2014

S: Hop heaven. Tons of juicy citrus: ripe orange, tangerine, grapefruit, mango. Amazing. Fresh hops just burst from the nose. I think there are simcoe hops in here, has the characteristic aroma in the background.
T: Really fresh, juicy, citrus hops. Same depth and profile as the nose. A bit of bitterness and pine, but not anywhere near what I'd call a bitter IPA. Really light and clean malt that has a little of crystal sweetness, but finishes is pretty dry. Citrus hops are a bit mild compared to the nose and seem to fade to some floral notes in the middle and finish. Finish is a little bitter with floral, pine, and some citrus. Fairly light, dry, and clean. It tastes unbelievably fresh.
M: Light to medium bodied, moderate to slightly high carbonation, somewhat sticky and resinous. Very nice crisp, dry finish. About as smooth as any dry IPA can be. 
O: Easily one of the best American Pale Ales I've had. It has more hop flavor than most IPAs, but with a great balance of bitterness and malt. It is a lot more dry than it is sweet, but I think it's a perfect balance of sugar. Crazy good crisp finish with a really pleasant lingering aftertaste. 1,259 charactersSatchboogie, Aug 03, 2014

A-Frothy white head with some mild retention. Thick lacing that quickly runs down the side of glass. light golden hazy beer.
S-Aroma hits as soon as the growler was opened. Aroma is strong and is a precursor of things to come. Lots of sweet smelling hops. Tropical fruits. Peach, oranges, mango. some grapefruit and faint pine
T-not as sweet as the nose at least at first but may change as it warms. Peach, orange, grapefruit, lemon/lime, some bitterness. flavors really pop as there is something about the beer that makes the flavors very bright and upfront. some maltiness to keep the hops in check. Bit of a bitter finish with some lingering pine and bitterness
M-medium bodied beer with ample carbonation. leaves you with a mouthful of flavor
O-strong showing here easy to see why this breweries beers are in such high demand 858 charactersbeerbully, Jul 27, 2014

poured into HF glass.
Appearance: cloudy golden yellow bodied beer with massive creamy white head.
Smell: Lots of juicy peach and grass in the aroma! Slightly dank and hint of chalk and cat piss. Hint of bready malts. 
Taste: Mild bitterness. Lots of juicy peach hops. Hint of citrus and pine. A mildly dankness and a hint of chalk! Light bready malts that are perfect for those hops.
Mouthfeel: light body with low almost moderate carbonation levels. Very creamy and very drinkable. 
Overall: This is almost like Pseudosue with a more prodominent peachy hop profile. As expected Edward is an excellent hoppy beer brewed by Sean Hill. 684 characters4DAloveofSTOUT, Jul 17, 2014

A - Great fresh haze, golden straw, fine cumulus cloudy head, lacing that lingers for the entire interaction.
S - Grass, lemon, a walk in the pine forest after the rain. A poem written with hops, malt and water.
T - Initial oils lead to a clean tight finish. The Columbus hops trail off into desire. Quite interesting how the taste ends nice and dry. The malt, hop dance is tempered with a hint of tannin, nothing out of balance.
M - The body is decieving, robust, full and well displayed across the palate. From citrus to peppper, with a stop in the pines for a glance, Edward displays true craft.
O - Advertized as an APA, with tinges of IPA. Edward is as creative and interesting as is befitting an ancestral homage.
Thank goodness this is the choice for a "flagship" beer from HFB.

Appearance looks like a double. Good head but disappears within minutes.
Taste -floral notes with Piney finish but as it sits the pine gets lost.

Big citrus orange, grapefruit and pine in the nose. Taste follows with citrus, mainly orange, and a piney resinous finish that is quite bitter for a pale ale. Slick mouthfeel coats the palate then in a flash goes away clean with a drying bitter finish. IPA like medium body is nice. Overall an amazing pale ale that delivers IPA mouthfeel and big flavor. 452 charactersHopBomb515, Jun 24, 2014

Pours a nice yellow pale color. It is a bit cloudy. Doesn't have much foam, although a head was formed but dissipated quickly. Aroma is of distinct hops. Taste is hoppy, great for those that are not looking for a piney IPA. This growler tasted a bit watery. Mouth feel is light. 310 charactersJulioH, Jun 20, 2014

The aroma is incredible. Citrusy hops, with a grapefruit character and a tropical fruitiness to it. Maybe a light piny sensation on the back end. The flavor is so similar. The hoppiness is heavy, but there isn't a overbearing bitterness. The fruitiness and light sweetness at the end is delightful. The mouth feel is almost perfect, and the dryness at the end is outstanding for an APA 495 charactersjbaker67, Jun 20, 2014

Piney, bitter, and dank as well! And so drinkable, it's scary. Try this stuff. ASAP! 340 charactersstella77artois, Jun 18, 2014

Pours slightly hazy golden color with a small fluffy white head. Beautiful aroma of fresh hop pellets, grass, hay, lightly sweet malts, very light citrus peel. Incredibly light bodied and fresh hops, sweet citrus and malt finish. Super easy drinking, medium carbonation, crisp and clean finish. Just awesome.

4.3/5  rDev -2.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5L: Super hazy with a gorgeous creamy head, this is how a hop-bomb apa is supposed to look.
A: Big pine resin, citrus, and peach hops notes with some fruity esters that lay in the back. Malt is very sublte in the nose, a touch bready.
T/M: Very big bitterness up front, much more akin to an IPA. Moves into the same hop flavors as the aroma, perhaps a tad more piney and zesty. The malt provides very little balance which is totally fine because this beer is all about the complex hop character. Mouthfeel is super dry but not watery, perfect for the style.
Overall, what an awesome APA (tastes like a West-Coast IPA), Hill Farmstead is totally living up to the hype. HOPS! 675 charactersSiriusfisherman, May 10, 2014

Poured from the 750ml growler into a Hill Farmstead stemmed tulip.
a: Cloudy orange with an inch tall white head which receded to rocky surface foam and patterned lacing.
s: Strong citrus.
t: Orange/grapefruit under a moderate to wicked hop bite. Bitter finish mellows out somewhat later..
m: Medium, fine body. Carbonation tingle on the tongue is persistent.
o; Great as a top flight American Pale Ale or DIPA. Deliciously citrusy with 85 IBUs to let you know it means business. A new favorite for sure, another reaffirmation that it was worth all the extra driving (3 hours round trip from Waitsfield) and line standing (an hour and a quarter, which I understand is about half of normal for a Saturday!) and money ($86 for 5.75 total liters or about $5.50 per 12 ounces including $19 for bottles) to get Hill Farmstead brews. Edward's relatively low ABV could make it the best session Pale Ale in existence. 952 charactersscotorum, Apr 29, 2014

Fat creamy head of white foam that lasted well and left lace. This beer smells floral and fruity. Lovely light citrus, pineapple and mango for intense sweetness. Earthy pine that is not heavy and does not stand out past the other scents. The malt on this nose is a light sweet perfume. So wonderful how all Hill's beer has this quality of lightness both in the nose and in the drink. I think if I had to summarize Hill's trademark as a brewer I would do it like this - He is trying to put the hops in the beer and leave them on the vine at the same time. He has a way with hops and in this beer they are so fruity and yet so light on the palate. That's his other trademark, the light malt that is so light it's like the beer wants to just float out of the glass. Crisp, light sweetness like a floral nectar, a bit of light sweet cracker that has exactly the perfect balance. The beer has a resonance rather than an aftertaste and it's light floral and fruitiness. As the beer warms some sweet grass and pine comes forward and this is just a lovely beer. 1,141 charactersutopiajane, Apr 20, 2014

Location: Hill Farmstead Brewery
Glassware: Pint Glass
Appearance: Hazy golden wheat color. Fluffy white head that is large for a Pale Ale. Nice cascading as the beer is consumed and a short head remains on the beer throughout. 
Aromatics: Lively citrus aromas. Loving some pineapple and mango scents. Some sweetener like honey. Grassy odors from the wheat. 
Flavor: The hops resonate in the flavor adding a touch of bitterness to go with that smooth sweet and fruity flavor. 
Mouthfeel: Silky smooth on the tongue. Light to Medium body with a very nice natural carbonation. 
Notes: Bottled on 4/9/14 and drank on the suggest serve by date of 4/17/14. Served from a 2L HF growler. 694 charactersKornWallace, Apr 18, 2014

750ml growler, filled about a week ago. Tulip glass.
A: Pours an orangish golden color, hazy, with a finger and a half of off-white head. The foam deflates slowly into a thick ring. A few streaks of lacing.
S: Well-balanced citrus and floral/herbal hops with lightly bread/biscuit/slightly sweet malt. 
T: Similar, with the malt a little more prominent, slight mineral character, and finishing with a long, mild bitterness which slowly grows.
M: Slightly milky mouthfeel, medium body, medium-light soft carbonation. 
O: Very drinkable, with subtle flavors and nice balance between hops and malt. That being said, there are probably half a dozen beers as good as this that I could buy off the shelf or trade for much more easily. 765 characterspmarlowe, Apr 16, 2014

A: Beautifully hazy, bright golden orange color with a thick white head that subsides leaving some nice lacing. 
S: Orange/citrus and mild piney hops. 
T: Follows the nose perfectly. Not a dank hop flavor and an easy drinker.
M: Great. Slight dryness to it.
O: Just another hit via the genius that is Hill Farmstead! 394 charactershuddyball, Apr 16, 2014

Always get Edward whenever I can on tap in vt, have never gotten a growler to bring home. Always overlook it because of the great double ipas. Poured in my HF tulip. Murky, bright gold, nice two finger head, sticks around for a bit. Great lacing on the glass. Smells so fresh. Juicy. Citrus mostly, small amount of grassy pine. The taste is very crisp. Lots of orange flavor upfront. Very light and refreshing. Nice hoppy aftertaste, but not huge. Makes this an easy drinker. 512 charactersMikeypnh, Apr 10, 2014

The aroma has bright tropical fruit, light citrus, grapefruit. 
The flavor follows hop juice flavor, grapefruit, citrus and tropical, but less than his older sister, Susan. Some light pine and grassiness and a light bready malt backbone.
A wonderful beer, though a bit overshadowed by other Hill Farmstead brews. 354 charactersdar482, Mar 17, 2014

A-Pour is hazed pale golden amber with a perfectly tight white head. Great lacing.
S-Aroma is huge hop, well balanced pale malt and grain bill with notes of grass and a strong citrus punch. 
T-Taste is a touch more balanced, very drinkable. Grain bill is more pronounced with a light pale malt. Hops are herbal, grapefruit and citrusy, grassy notes linger with a very light bitterness.
M-The mouthfeel is almost perfect, and the dryness at the end is outstanding for an APA. Great carbonation.
O-Overall an awesome APA a must get! 563 charactersreebtaerG, Mar 05, 2014

Very much citrus for aroma. Tinge of pine. Sweet malt.
What a taste! Grapefruit, tropical fruit, a bit of pine, some grassy hops. Bready.
A nice hoppy beer, but still somewhat restrained.
The first Hill Farmstead beer I've tried. Am looking forward to many more. 374 characterslordofthewiens, Feb 23, 2014

Pours a beautiful hazy golden straw colour. Kind of a peach colour, actually. It's got that effervescent Hill Farmstead head- 2cm white, thick and creamy looking head with very good retention. Lacing is there, but not the best characteristic about this beer.
This is an interesting beer to smell. In the beginning with the pour, its 100% papaya. I can't get over how much papaya I smelled. Then as it opens up, there is more of the mango and citrus, and by the time I finish the glass, it is pretty much a citrus bomb. It's really delicious smelling with a nice caramel-tasting malt backbone. 
The flavour on this is rather interesting. It doesn't have that progression of hop flavours, but it is rather bready with a ton of tropical fruit on top.. what stands out is that super strong bitterness. We looked it up and its 80 theoretical IBUs.. which is a real surprise treat. It's very bitter in the beginning in a very good way. What's awesome is that by the halfway point, the bitterness has passed and we have a delicious balanced pale ale- tons of citrus without much bitterness. Or did the palate get used to it? We'll never know. 
Mouthfeel is that creamy, effervescent Hill Farmstead style.. not as much as Susan, Abner, Ephraim, etc. but still significantly so. I really can't get over how Shaun Hill makes his beer feel like this. No booze going on here. So sessionable but jam-packed with flavours.
This is one hell of an American Pale Ale. It feels like an IPA with that bitterness quotient and hop flavour bombing, but so sessionable. It's probably second only to Zombie Dust I think if you count that as an APA. Really the best APA out there. Hill Farmstead, you never cease to amaze.
Re-visited on tap multiple times on my recent Vermont pilgrimage during the week of 2/11/2014. New thoughts on this beer, having had multiple of highly acclaimed American Pale Ales such as Zombie Dust, pseudoSue, etc. and having had the chance to enjoy this at least 8 times since the first growler I split back in September. The best thing about this beer is that it is so complex that each time I taste it, there's something different that stands out that was previously in the background. It has citrus, passion fruit, mango, floral, pine hop characters in there. Most of the time, citrus and passion fruit stands out, but other times the floral and pine stands out. It just seems to depend on how you're feeling that day. And either way the delicious malt backbone provides just enough sweetness along with the fantastic HF mouthfeel to make drinking this a real treat. It's not overwhelmingly bitter, is flavourful and almost juicy, and a true pleasure to drink no matter where I am in my day or my life. It's by far my favorite American Pale Ale and in my opinion, it is more or less perfect. 2,942 charactersStevedore, Feb 15, 2014

Nose is huge hop, well balanced pale malt and grain bill with notes of weed and a strong citrus punch. Taste is a touch more balanced, very drinkable. Grain bill is more pronounced with a light pale malt. Hops are herbal ad citrusy, grassy notes linger with a very light bitterness, assertive carbonation and a light airy body.
Growler - nose is stronger citrus, orange and peach. Taste also has more hops, some citrus and some fresh fruity green notes, still well balanced grain, clean and fresh. Bitterness is a touch less than I remember. 608 characterscpetrone84, Feb 06, 2014

Smell is beaming with citrus hops and a bit of resin and caramel in the background. 
A nice flourish of orange and grapefruit is quickly underscored by notes of grain, sugar and caramel. As evidenced with other HF tries this one is about as perfect as you can get with the hop/malt balance. 
Light bodied and crisp with a soft middle.

M - Standard HF high quality. Crisp and clean, and left nice tingle throughout mouth.
O - Best APA I have tried. Surprised it was not an IPA. Highly recommended. 537 charactersDuane_Opfer, Nov 04, 2013

3.9/5  rDev -11.2%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.75This beer pours a cloudy pale orange with a very thin white cap that quickly dissipates. First impression is strongly of orange citrus. Nice hints of pine with a bready malt background. 
The taste is not as complex as the scent,but interesting in its own ways. It begins somewhat thin, but rounds out nicely developing to a medium bodied mouthfeel. Initially a nondescript bitterness that gives midway through to the bread like malt flavor. Finishes with an agressive hop bitterness. A little disappointing that some of the wonderful scent does not carry through as well into the flavor. 588 charactersJmamay22, Oct 26, 2013

Beautiful light straw color. Small head, and some lacing. 
Smell is light and refreshing but still with a hint of what's to come.
Beautifully done. Considering it's light alcohol it has enough character to go the distance.
I've had it a while ago, but all I can say that it followed a Heady Topper and did not disappoint! 
One of the better pale ales I've had. Give it a try if you get a chance. 493 charactersDavidBart, Oct 25, 2013

Bottom Line: This is a mediocre beer that does not live up to the hype. It is certainly not worth the long trip to the brewery, located in the middle of nowhere, and it is NOT worth the wait in the long, non-moving, weekend lines to obtain a fill of this mediocre, overpriced beer that is being sold from a keg/tap/growler-fill system that reeks of amateur hour. My score above is not influenced by my poor experience at the brewery - it is based on the beer alone - but the experience did leave a bad taste in my mouth and I can't help but think that this underwhelming beer is not even good enough to wash that taste away. 
A: Beautiful, opaque, golden orange colored beer with a small, 1cm head if poured down the side of the glass. (Another pour directly into the bottom of a pint glass resulted in a thick, foamy head)
S: A medium, hoppy nose, with hints of grapefruit. Not yeasty. A little bit ambiguously citrus-y
T: A mild, undeveloped flavor. Mild, cold, bitterness is the only flavor to speak of in a way that is almost identical to the skin of an orange or a grapefruit. The flavor is really shallow, with no interesting initial note and no finish, other than mild grapefruit skin bitterness. Not bad, but extremely underwhelming. WHERE IS THE FLAVOR?
M: Nice mouthfeel, with medium carbonation, that imparts a nice, fully, mouthfeel
O: Very mediocre. it had promise based on the smell and look, but the taste is so underwhelming one-dimensional, that I am completely unable to understand why this beer is more well-rated than so many other quality beers. 1,690 characterstkdchampxi, Oct 20, 2013

3.8/5  rDev -13.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4As a Vermonter, I've been lucky enough to have Edward on tap at my place of employment at all times. People love it. The Hill Farmstead joke (if you haven't heard it) is that THIS beer is the best beer ever created. But it's not as good as last years. (This works with all Hill Farmstead, obviously).
That said, I only like Edward. I do not love it. Most beer lovers seem to have embraced the idea that the hoppier a beer is, the better it must be. Edward, which must be pretty high in IBU's, represents what I don't like about the current craze.
Edward is beautiful. It's the perfect blonde/golden/orange mix and it always has a pleasant thick white head.
It smells amazing. Sean Hill knows how to use and blend hops better than anyone and I love the mix of citrus/butterscotch/pine that I get from Edward.
When I taste it however, I feel that the hops and bitterness therein mask it's flavor. Or rather, this IS the flavor and I wonder if people are so taken aback by their sudden numbness and so on board with all the hype that they say "Hey! That's a really hoppy pale ale! It MUST be good!" And don't get me wrong. There aren't that many sheep in the world and the true experts agree that this is a great beer. So I'm not trying to say it's bad. I just think that as far as APA's go, this one is a bit extreme in the IBU's and better labeled an IPA. After one Edward, I want an IPA. When possible, I normally switch to Abner or another Hill in which I find the extreme hops use to be more akin to the style and less of an obstruction to its taste.
The mouthfeel, as with all great hoppy beers, is wonderful. Honestly, I like drinking Edward more because of the way it coats your mouth than the way it tastes on your tongue. 
Overall, Edward is a solid beer. But compared to other Hill Farmstead offerings (What Is Enlightenment? The single hop Citra, Grassroots Legitimacy IPA or Abner, just to name a few that I enjoy more), I feel that Edward is overrated. 1,963 charactersSnacksForMax, Oct 12, 2013

Served a slightly hazed, apricot in color with a frothy, dense white head that retains well and leaves heavy lace. From the first encounter, this uniquely flavorful and balanced pale really showed off how great a typically simple style can be if crafted properly. Lots of tropical, citrusy hop character with a lovely presence softened by notes of herbal grass, peach, and the pale bready malt body. Lush hops notes with a very tempered, midrange bitterness complimenting a light malt sweetness. Light-moderate body with a moderate carbonation and dry finish with a touch of resin. Rests near the top of the apa heap. 665 charactersblackie, Oct 04, 2013

Flavor is so green, fresh, and juicy...hoppy grapefruit, tangerine, pine, peachy sweetness, and spicy, slightly herbal notes. Medium bodied and very smooth, lightly carbonated, and dry with a lingering bitter finish. We had no problem killing the growler in short order. 522 characterswedge, Oct 03, 2013

Edward I enjoy from growler fills on site at HFB. 
Pouring into a snifter the color is a medium golden hue. Nice head forms from an aggressive pour.
The aromas I get from the glass are stunning. Fruit, citrus, sweetness and alcohol. Glorious. It rivals Double Sunshine for magnificent aroma.
Taking a mouthful reveals a glorious balance of hop based citrus flavors and mellow sweetness. This is beer I could drink all day. It's not overwhelming, yet not overly subtle. Perfectly crafted.
Nice light bubbles form a nice mouthfeel.
Edward is a perfectly crafted beer and one of my all time favorites. 678 charactersBoldRulerVT, Oct 03, 2013

Actually laces quite well despite the pour. The nose is celery and resiny hops, fresh citrus and melons. Taste is drier, lighter, soapy, nutty bitter with melon rind and fermented jackfruit. Interesting with lots of rich tropical fruitiness. On style for APA. 6/6/2011 7/4/7/4/14=3.6
Tap at the Moll household thanks to yourefragile. Gorgeous pour: thick buttermilk foam, huge rocky retention. Glowing, bright peach color. Huge lacing. Nose has the essential Hill Farmstead sweet cream butter going on in the nose along with fresh biscuit. Oh, there is a ton of dank hops but the malt character is more impressive as always. Taste is very quenching, soft, biscuity, sourdough, light fruitiness like cantaloupe and peach. Grassy, herbal hops come to balance. So nice to have a zero astringency, zero abrasive, zero specialty malt stickiness APA. Hill Farmstead has this style on lockdown and should write the textbook. 1,039 characterstarheels86, Sep 25, 2013

The beer arrived in a pint glass with about a finger's worth of head. The beer is densely cloudy and looks like a golden mango. Not sure how this color comes to be.

S - Wonderful mix of citrusy hop scents. Maybe just a hint of bready malt. Maybe.
T - I'm getting all hop flavors here, with minimal bitterness. Excellent flavor.
M - Great medium body with a hint of carbonation. It feels really nice.
O - I'm beginning to understand why these beers are rated so highly. However, I can't help but notice that, while everything I tried on this recent trip has been delicious, it has also been relatively one dimensional. I'd love to try some other non IPA/APA styles. 759 charactersAndrew041180, Sep 23, 2013

I never mention bitterness in my reviews, my bitterness taste buds are ridiculously under-sensitive.
APPEARANCE : Lovely golden straw yellow. Hazy to a point. Reasonable head forms on pour but dissipates pretty fast, leaving some thin lacing that doesn't look like it's going to stick around much. Very appetizing look, I just want to dive in there.
SMELL : First nose is malts and citrus hops with some herbs as well. Definite tropical fruit undertone. Second nose releases some sharper herbal hop aromas, making the hop profile more precise. Malt is still just as present. Third nose follows this but amplifies the malt.
TASTE : Oh man, this is good stuff. A full palette of malt flavours just burst into your mouth, beautifully supported by the hops. As it goes down, the sharper hop aromas become somewhat earthy and crisper. There's also a certain minerality hidden behind the whole thing and even though it might seem too discreet to be of importance, I get the feeling that this is what actually supports the whole thing and holds it together.
MOUTHFEEL : I could've done with a rounder, fuller mouthfeel, but that's just me. As it is now, it seems too close to the mouthfeel an IPA might show. Still very nice, but a little too thin, I think.
OVERALL : Incredible beer that, even though it's called American Pale Ale, might actually be a hybrid of APA and IPA. Not quite hoppy enough to be an IPA, but in my own opinion, not quite round and generous enough to be an APA. Still, I'm glad I still have a couple glasses of this where that came from. I'll enjoy every last drop of it. 1,642 charactersFrostBlast, Sep 18, 2013

When all you drink for 2 weeks straight is Zombie Dust, Double Sunshine, and Heady, then even regular, very good beers might being to appear less very good by dint of comparison.
This is good. Totally. But it's like I tell it's not Xtreme and so that makes it seem less good. Weird, huh?
Anyhow, a straight up single American IPA. The hop profile is wondrously variegated, meaning the aroma is damn near perfect. The hops dominate the first end, bitter moving into sweet, but then the finish is a little watery, a bit of a let down. 
Very good. Potentially excellent, even, if I hadn't been so spoiled lately. 759 charactersmynie, Sep 11, 2013

White head. Color is a golden orange.

Served in a Hill Farmstead narrow pint glass, it has the typical H.F. hoppy beer look to it. Hazy bright orange, nice white head that retains well leaves satisfactory lace. 
The scent is solid and promising. Citrus and herbal hops, bready and some sweeter malts. Tropical.
The taste is great as remembered. Citrus/tangerine, good amount of herbal, general tropical flavors, and some pine. Nice soft bready, cracker-y malts balance things out nicely but definitely more hop-forward than your average pale ale. Simply great and easy drinking.
The mouthfeel is fine mostly but felt just a bit on the thin side, maybe could've use more carbonation as well. Maybe the beer's biggest, though slight, flaw.
Loads of hop flavor without a ton of bitterness, great malt backing, very drinkable, this is to be expected from Hill Farmstead. Having had it recently as well, I prefer What is Enlightenment? as far as their pale ales go, but this is certainly very good by all means. 1,169 charactersChico1985, Aug 21, 2013

A: A hazy, copper color (an unfiltered beer so hazy is expected); A big sudsy white head (3+ fingers) slowly settling leaving a curtain of lace.
S: An awesome huge hop nose with lots of sweet citrus (oranges and tangerines), a bit of spicy floral bittering hops, nice pine character; a touch of sweet malt.
T: A bit dryer than the nose; the American bittering hops hit first (spicy and floral) with a good deal of resinous pine; still present are all the citrus notes (oranges and grapefruit zest). The finish is dry and very clean.
M: Medium body and carbonation. Smooth and clean holding up well in a growler.
O: Delicious. Edward achieves a great balance of hops and malt with a massive hoppy nose and an enticing appearance. 827 charactersmtomlins, Aug 12, 2013

AP: Colour reminds me of orange or peach marmalade or fruit spreads. Looks rather chewy for an APA, like it has a good malty body to it. Head poured a fluffy white 1" that settled down to 1/4" with minimal lacing on the sides when the glass was tilted so good head retention.
AR: Bready (like toasted baguette) and biscuit malts with a hint of caramel malt. Grapefruit and pine hop aromas. There's more fruity aromas but it's like they're trying to hide from you instead of boldly making their presence known. Peach, nectarine, tangerine and guava are what I'm getting out of this after several more whiffs.
T: The malts flavours are like dinner rolls and chewy grainy bread loaf. Peach and apricot fruits mostly towards the front end with a slightly bitter lemony bite at the finish, reminding me of a Berliner Weiss. A little bit of pine and grapefruit on the lingering aftertaste.
M: Mildy carbonated, medium body, slightly dry finish.
OV: As with Susan, this is a very solid and high quality beer that I would drink regularly if I was able to do so. However, this beer also didn't 'blow my mind' and while I think it's very good, to me it's not quite World Class. I am glad I got to try this. 1,293 charactersGuinnessAtRogerWilco, Aug 11, 2013

Hill Farmstead wine glass
A: Cloudy lighter orange color. Unfiltered. Two fingers of fluffy bright white head. Lots of carbonation still. Sticky lacing sheeting is left of the glass.
S: Really nice tropical fruit on the nose. Mango, tangerine, over ripe peach. Some pine in there as well. Smells more of an IPA than a pale ale. Minimal malt character.
T: Nice mild bitterness up front. Getting the fruity hop character that you took from the nose, some pine, and it just works. Typical to HF pale ales, thinner malt bill letting the hops shine. Finish is fairly dry. Clean and refreshing.
M: Medium bodied. Lingering bitterness. 667 charactersinlimbo77, Aug 05, 2013

4.4/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25We pop the top on our refillable Hill Farmstead 750mL bottle, pouring a brew of muted sunset orange into our Great Lakes pint glasses. It holds a two finger head of creamy, cakey, and massive off-white bubbles, showing nice retention, and leaving honeycomb lacing all around the glasses as it bubbles and crackles away. A chill haze cuts clarity, but no sediment is noted. Carbonation appears to be active. The aroma is beautifully sweet, with the hops taking you off your feet from the first whiff. Varietals give notes of sopping wet citric juiciness, sweet fruitiness, bright florals, and resiny slickness. The malts are pale crisp, and evenly sweet, with a light toast, and a soft powdery dryness to them. The water is hard, with mineral, mud, and stoned gravel. With warmth comes light booziness, white grape sweetness, biting lemon rind, grapefruit, and tangerine, green grassiness, and spice of sesame seed, black pepper, and mustard greens. Our first impression is that the beer is incredibly flavorful, with a surprising lack of sweetness that goes well with the bittered grain and well watered depth, making it uniquely refreshing. As we sip, the taste opens with floral, herbal, and syrupy grapefruit hoppiness, booze and black pepper, mineral water heaviness, tart lemon, flashes of honey sweetness, softness of oat and grittiness of pale malts, concrete dustiness, and nectarine sweetness. The middle comes to a peak with browned apple sweetness, continued earthy, lemony and grapefruity hops, enhanced bitterness of rind, sulfur bite, wet clay, more fusel boozy warmth, and echoes of soured plastics as we transition to the finish. Here we are given the final mixture of tangy green grapes, white florals, nectary and ever-so-brightly citric and syrupy hops, pale and powdery raw maltiness, bittered grit of grass and plant blub, light cherry fruitiness, and a final flash of white sugar and clover honey. The aftertaste breathes of authentic grapefruit flesh juiciness and bitterness, further airs of herbal hops, tangerine and apricot sugars, tannic herbal teas, mineral and clay, biting yeasty puck, and that pale malt mash. The body is light to medium, and carbonation is high, but inoffensive. Each sip gives hearty slurp, smack, cream, and froth, with the mouth left fully coated with foam. There is an interesting involuntary shutter of the mouth into a moderate puck, leaving things left feeling tartly tingly and astringently dried. The abv is appropriate, and the beer drinks very well. 
Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was the hop explosion on the nose, and the wonderfully interwoven realism of the farm’s well-water. As in some of their other hoppy beers, this plays an integral part in the aroma and the flavoring, giving a certain genuine brush to it, and making the grain and oily hoppiness that much more close, wholesome, and real. The hops through the flavoring, here, were insanely flavorful, juicy, and authentic, giving the illusion that one was literally sucking on a thin slice of dripping wet grapefruit. Again, this mixed with the exquisite base components, making for yet another memorable, thoughtful, and deliberate beer with true character. 3,201 charactersTheBrewo, Jul 29, 2013

My best description of Edward is a craft brew with the drink-ability of an American-Ale and the hops of an IPA. Medium head, bright amber in color, and definitely a fair share of carbonation. Versatile beer that will appeal to the hop-obsessed majority, but also the sweet, smooth, easy to drink minority of craft beer lovers.

Pours a large white, creamy, foamy head with super small bubbles – almost three fingers worth. Color is hazy yellow amber, touching on orange. I’m smelling huge amounts of citrus - predominantly grapefruit but also orange peel and a little bit of lemon zest. There’s a slight amount of piney aroma as well. The taste is almost perfection. It’s everything I want a pale ale to be. The malts and hops are completely balanced with an unrivaled lingering finish. The pale malt is wonderful. All the citrus is still there as it was on the nose and the fruity, citrusy hops are just enough without going too far. Mouthfeel is super creamy and it the head is retained all the way to the bottom of the glass. It would be tough to ask for a better pale ale. It quenches my thirst like none other. 903 charactersgreenmtn1111, Jul 24, 2013

Good carbonation action throughout the body. Nose of lemon-lime citrus sweetness, pepper and basil spice, and a subtle biscuit backbone. Wow! Flavors of citrus and spiced hops on the forward tongue, followed by a light caramel sweet and bready backbone. Very balanced and very easy to drink. Body kept light by the carbonation. The aftertaste has piney and grassy hops characteristics, with a subtle citrus sweet linger. Clean, dry finish, begging for more. Flavorful and easy to drink, this one could be trouble. Great brew! 654 charactersGarthDanielson, Jun 29, 2013

Pours a light amber-orange with a dense off-white head.
Aroma of onion, grass, and herbal hops. Little tropical fruit presence.
Citrus, lemon, light pine, some onion, and herbal hoppiness upfront. Bready malt middle. Lemon, onion, and pine finish. Lingering lemon citrus bitterness.
Medium body with moderate carbonation. Slightly foamy finish.
Pretty good--a solid pale ale.

4.12/5  rDev -6.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4750ml growler poured into a Hill Farmstead wine glass.
The beer pours a hazy orange color, hues of gold and copper with some sediment floating around, a nice finger of white head that has good retention, and leaves a lot of soapy lace behind. The aroma is of nice, ample hops, pine, citrus, floral character that really balances everything with some sweet malt. Lots of bitter pine on the tongue, crisp citrus and with wildflower that binds everything, sweet malt lingers on the tongue. The body is nice, solid yet light, coats the mouth fairly well, and finishes with a lightly dry kick. 
Verdict: A very nice pale ale from Hill Farmstead, quite drinkable, nice hop profile without being an aggressively hopped and bitter pale ale. It's not in the same league as What is Enlightenment, but this is a fine ale that I would love to drink regularly. 849 characterskevanb, Jun 15, 2013
4.41/5  rDev +0.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Served from a 2L growler into an Alchemist nonic.
Appearance- Hazy orange with half finger of white head tha left some fine lacing.
Smell- Citrus and pine abound. Hops are earthy and citrusy. Very clean with nice malt nose.
Taste- Pine and bread. Very herbaceous hops. Malts are there, but not overwhelming.
Mouthfeel- Ample carbonation and crisp body. Easy drinking.
Overall- This is a great pale up there with Zombie Dust and Blue Lobsters Gold Claw. 457 charactersSeanniek91, Jun 14, 2013

A - Classic HF appearance: murky with a nice head and excellent lacing. Lighter colored than their IPAs and DIPAs, but still a rich golden hue. For an &lt; 6% beer, it gives the appearance of a full bodied IPA. 
O - Super aromatic and intensely hoppy for a pale ale. Mounds of citrus. One of the most pleasant smelling APAs I have had.
T - Very crisp, bursting with hops for a nice grassy flavor. Just enough breadiness to balance the hops without weighing down the beer. Restrained a bit, so it leaves you wanting more.
M - Oily and super creamy, provides that expected HF mouthfeel. This beer is extremely drinkable.
O - My favorite pale ale. Hill Farmstead is my favorite brewery for a reason, and its no surprise that their "standard" brew hits all the right notes. Edward is simply a classic. 905 charactersTychoNDC, Jun 11, 2013

Peachy orange, nearly opaque, a thin layer of white froth sits on top, leaving behind a ring of delicate lacing. The skim parts to one side after a couple of sips. 
Big citrus aroma of tangerine and grapefruit, citric with a green undercurrent. Bitter grapefruit pith and resiny pine bitterness that lingers into the aftertaste. Very smooth and drinkable with a light carb level. My personal jury is still out if this is any better than Zombie Dust. 498 charactersemerge077, Jun 05, 2013

3.86/5  rDev -12.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.75On draft at Three Penny Taproom, Montpelier.
Heavily hazed cumquat with a very respectable white head that holds qwll and laces nicely.
Nice tropical notes of mango, apricot and pineapple above a barely there malt backbone.
Bitterness kicks straight away, with resinous pine and grapefruit putting away the tropical character pretty smartly. Some subdued biscuity malt character pokes through, and as it warms, the tropical notes creep back. Quite the punch for a Pale Ale.
Chewy and oily owing to the hop resins. Carbonation spreads the bitterness quickly and effectively.
Flavour packed and satisfying Pale Ale, but for my palate it pushes the bitterness to the point that drinkability is slightly impaired. 714 charactersspicelab, May 28, 2013

Appearance - Deep hazy copper. Big white head. Excellent lacing. Excelleng retention.
Smell - Simple but clean hop aroma. Variety of citrus and pine. Nothing necessarily distinct or strong, but a nice hop nose. Biscuit malt rounds it out.
Taste - Perfect balance of hop and malt. Never overpowering. Citrus, slight sweetness to the malt, then pine hops. Biscuit malt in the back and just a slight bitterness.
Mouthfeel - Medium bodied. Drinkable in its balance. Medium carbonation. 
Overall - It took me two glasses to really appreciate the majesty of this beer. It's everything I want in a pale ale and just about perfect. 665 charactersAlieniloquium, May 26, 2013

Another one of the fruits of our labor from our Greensboro weekend, this was a great brew for the nice weather we had, would definitely get this one again.
Look - Pours a slightly hazy copper amber with a rich soapy head. Abundant sticky as hell lacing, this was fresh from the brewery and enjoyed the same day. Minimal carbonation.
Smell - Tang and sour citrus (apricots, orange, lemon, nectarines) with a slight snappy malt. Mouth-watering.
Taste - Flavor blast of citrus creeps in and hits a pinnacle at hyper-sour apricot hops.
Mouthfeel - Full bodies but super drinkable, smooth and crisp. No booziness. Just enough carbonation to keep it snappy. Slightly sticky but in a good way.
Overall - Hill Farmstead never disappoints, this is a great Spring and Summer brew, refreshing and light for its style. 844 charactersJMScowcroft, May 21, 2013

On draft in a tulip at Blue Dog Cafe in Chalfont. Great piney taste throughout the entire beer, more so as it gets warmer. Great lacing and mouthfeel. Very drinkable. My first Hill Farmstead beer is certain impressive. Just having Topper about 2 days again, I'm thinking I need to relocate to VT for sure.

On tap at Farmhouse Tap and Grill. Pours a cloudy burnt orange color with an inch of frothy head. Some lacing. The aroma is hoppy with some citrus and tropical fruits. Maybe tangerine? the taste is bitter apricots with nice tropical fruits. grapefruit notes as well. Nice bitterness with a good amount of fruity hop flavor. Dry and resinous. This is a Pale Ale with a lot of fruity and hoppy that rivals most IPAs. Overall, its bitter, hoppy and drinkable. Glad I got to try it.

A - Really cloudy orange pour with one finger of white head. Good carbonation. Film retention and great drapes of lace all around. 
S - Passionfruit, orange, bright citrus. Very bright and poppy hops coming at you. Smells like ripe, light tropical fruits. Maybe galaxy?
T - Passionfruit, grapefruit pith, citrus, orange, peach. Lot's more bright and tropical hops.
M - Good carbonation, medium body, and a good citrus bitterness.
O/D - A pretty nice pale ale. Seems pretty heavy with that bright, lovley fresh citrus flavour, and it's really thirst quenching and complex. Really well made, to the point, and tasty. Very drinkable too. A good one. 724 charactersbylerteck, May 05, 2013

Appearance: Pours a hazy light amber and leaves a finger or two of white head.
Smell: Piney hops - surprising potent for a pale ale, and very enticing. Perhaps some honey and mild spices as well, but delicious pine definitely dominates.
Taste: Pine upfront, perhaps some citrus as well as honey and floral hops. It has the hop flavor of an IPA and is really light and crisp. Delicious.
Mouth-feel: Really light bodied and very refreshing - a decent amount of carbonation, just the right amount.
Overall: A great version of hop-forward pale ale. The piney hop flavor is very dominant and surprisingly strong for such a light ale. A great session ale for hop-lovers. 756 charactersResuin, Apr 24, 2013

I had no expectations, because I knew nothing about this beer.
It had the malty hoppy smell of a brewery. As I tasted it, I could tell it had a high IBU, but it wasn't out of balance. This was an exceptional beer. I asked the bartender about it and she informed me that, "the brewery is the highest rated in the world." 
Needless to say the beer blew me away!! One of the best all around beers I have ever had.
Experiences like this are what it's all about! 521 charactersIrishKevin, Apr 11, 2013

They did a beer exchange with some Vermont breweries and got like 20 different beers. I had Edward in a 12 oz glass and I must say, it was very smooth. It had a nice amount of hops, yet was not at all overpowering. There was a little foam when poured, but that quickly dissipated. It poured a nice light orange color and smelled very nice. I highly recommend this beer. 428 charactersMitchD14, Apr 03, 2013

4.3/5  rDev -2.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25The beer pours a hazy orange-yellow and several shades darker than Society and Solitude #6 (I just reviewed that beer, and that is why I am comparing them in color). The beer also pours with a big rocky, egg shell white head of varying sized bubbles which leaves sticky fat strings on the glass as it mellows into a finger’s width head. In body the beer is a cloudy haze, like most hoppy beers from Hill Farmstead. On the nose, the beer smells of juicy citrus hops with touches of tropical fruit and a solid backbone of pine. The malt is present as a light spicy bread and sweet caramel that melds nicely with the Hill Farmstead ale yeast’s breadiness. This is a nice smell that highlights the hops while still giving a good light malt character. On the tongue, the beer tastes bitter sweet with a slight acidity from the hops. In flavor, the beer begins as juicy hops, featuring sweet orange and tangerine flavors with touches of tropical fruit before it blossoms into grapefruit, bitter pine, and then aspirin flavors that properly bite. Beneath the bitters rise a nice malt character that is slightly caramelly and mellow, it also features a slight spice grain flavor. The finish is surprisingly long and returns to the beginning’s juicy hop flavors only now with a solid cereal caramel flavor that is mellow and warming on the throat. The aftertaste brings the bitters back to the tongue with lingering whiffs of cereal malts. In the mouth, this beer feels medium light and creamy in body with a beautiful fluffy carbonation that I’m coming to expect from Hill Farmstead. The mouth is left bitter-dry but wet on the sides of the tongue from the hop acids. Overall, this may be my favorite American pale ale of those I have tried. Mo from the Maine Beer Company is a little behind it, though I think Mo had a better nose, but this beer handles its bitters beautifully and melds them into the malts so that each has its turn to shine on the palate. Its taste definitely surpasses Mo, and that is where it counts. This is another beautiful beer from Hill Farmstead. Try this beer. 2,089 charactersMaxwell, Apr 01, 2013

Pours a hazy, cloudy orange, with amber tints. Perfect look- one of the best looking beers I've ever seen. Looks like peach in liquid form. Great, big head, about 3 inches.
Smells and tastes very similar. Tons of citrus, with little bitterness. Insanely drinkable hop elixir here. Pineapple, peach, grapefruit, orange, so many fruit flavors here.
Light to medium bodied, fully and well carbonated.
Hill Farmstead's flagship for good reason. I could drink this all day. 520 charactersGreesyFizeek, Mar 29, 2013
4.75/5  rDev +8.2%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75My first taste of the highly coveted Hill Farmstead Ale was just a brief encounter: we had concert tickets and 15 minutes to kill, so the opportunity was there. Requesting Double Galaxy and Abner was a waste of time as all the Farmhouse had on tap was Edward.
For $6.50 you get a 13 oz goblet of this cloudy rust colored nectar that left a nominal head and has a very flowery nose with a bit of citrus in there,slightly malty: not a knockout punch aroma but a very pleasant one at that. This is a rich, delicately flavored ale that is nicely balanced with subtle flavors that rest on the palate beautifully, and fade into a caramel,floral, slightly citrusy aftertaste that disappeared a bit quicker than I would have liked, but this is not a DIPA either.
Most definitely a top notch Ale made with a thoughtful selection of hops, ale malt and well water from the Hill Farm. Very inviting and for those that appreciate a moderate amount of bitterness, it is a great choice: those expecting a wallop to the palate might feel let down on that front, but there is no denying the quality and the high level of craft to produce this complex and delicious Vermont ale. 1,162 charactersHendry, Mar 28, 2013

A- pours a hazy golden with a big 3" off-white head. Big blotches and clumps of lacing all over the glass.
S- honey, biscuit, some citrus, pine and slight spice.
T- pale malts, slight sweetness, citrus, citrus rind and bitter pine.
M- light body and medium carbonation. Thin feel while still having a smoothness to it.
O- probably not a fair review of this beer (growler is 3 weeks old) but not sure if I will ever get to try it again. Surprised how much head it still poured, but I think the aroma and taste suffered from the age. 589 characterskawilliams81, Mar 21, 2013

Reminds me of a toned down galaxy- I would say more prominent citrus notes and a bit of subtle tropical fruit in the background. The hops are lightly floral but still very juicy and I can still get some risinous tastes, but not too overwhelming. Taste is very well balanced- juicy and fruity hops come at you with grapefruit, tangerine, and a little lemon? I can notice the malt however its in the background and doesn't take away from the hoppy PA nature of the brew. Balance between the hops and malt is the key for this PA - however the hops are certainly brought to the forefront which is what I would want out of an PA of this nature. I prefer DIPAs above all else, however I loved this HF brew and I would certainly recommend it to anyone- don't let the APA style fool you, it still has tons of excellent hoppy character. 960 characters80x2HopHead, Mar 19, 2013

A - the first pour, which was quite cold, didn't produce much head. Subsequent pours after warming a bit produced a good inch or more or loose white head. Appears a translucent golden color. Very nice looking beer.
S - lots of floral hope with some citrus peel. Orange and lemon zest. 
T - quick kick of bitter and citrus grapefruit. Some richer orange peel type flavored, ends with a crisp bitter finish, leaving a floral/lemon aftertaste.
M - medium high carb, lots of oily hop, nice.
O - I would drink it all the time if I could. Strays away from the in your face imperial approach and is just a nice medium presentation of hops. 677 charactersBeerandboards, Mar 14, 2013

Hazy orange complexion with a loose, quarter inch off-white head that dissipates into a consistent skim. Concentric bands of lacing encircle the shoulders of the glass. Nose expresses citrus and floral notes; slightly grassy and delicate with some biscuity aromas towards the back. Taste follows nose; however, more of an earthy/grassy character comes out in the flavor profile with the citrus notes lingering lightly and some hops bittering in the background. There's also a trace of wet cardboard at the finish. Mouthfeel is light and lively with a pleasant, palate cleansing carbonation. Overall, an immensely quaffable American Pale Ale that is a hallmark of the style in my humble opinion. 775 charactersJwale73, Mar 05, 2013

A - Pours with a fruit juice'y haziness and a pale dirty golden color. A three finger cap of dense, tightly bubbled foam lingers for a long time before falling and leaving behind thick webs of sticky lacing on the glass.
S - Smells wonderful - filled with lots of piney hops, plenty of grapefruit and tropical fruits and pineapple. Mild hop bitterness finds its way into the aroma. Not much for malt here...but the hops smell so good, it doesn't matter.
T - The smell doesn't lie. Lots of piney hops, thick and resiny with complementing white grapefruit - sharp, citrusy, juicy. Faint trace of malt underneath...a bit biscuity. Bitterness is mid-level and clean/crisp. This reminds me quite a bit of RR's Blind Pig...not a bad thing to be reminded of...
M - Body is a thinnish medium with an assertive mid/high carbonation level. Crisp and clean bitterness lingers for a long time past the swallow. Balance is good - easy to drink a lot of this one.
O - Another well made hoppy beer from Hill. They really know how to do these beers well. Tons of hop flavor, excellent balance, smooth and easy to quaff a bunch of this. If it was more plentiful, this would probably be in my fridge all of the time. 1,245 charactersportia99, Feb 21, 2013

Edward pours a nice dark golden color with a thick two finger head that slowly dissipates leaving the glass laced. This beer definitely showcases the hops. The aroma is of pine and grapefruit. The flavor is goes along and one gets the citrus first followed by the piney essences. There is almost a resiny flavor from the hops. The bitterness lingers for a little bit on the back of the tongue before fading away slowly. This beer is light and mildly bubbly leaving just a hint of stickiness after the swallow. Overall, Edward is a very nice Pale Ale on the hoppier end of the spectrum. 635 charactersLevich, Jan 01, 2013

Pours a slightly hazy light golden color with a nice bone white head that persists forever. Wow that aroma has got lots of hops in it for a Pale ale! Juicy citrus and pine with a hint of green onion and a touch of bready malt make for a wonderful smelling beer. The flavor is loaded with pine and citrus with a bit of sweet malt to back it up. Flavorful bitterness, but never harsh. Medium to light body with a moderate to high level of carbonation and a bready resinous mouthfeel. This is a great little beer, that at times feel more like and IPA, but its so damn good I'm not going to quibble of stylistic designations. 675 charactersjohnnnniee, Dec 09, 2012

S - 4 - Aroma is light to moderate grapefruit, papaya, spicy, crisp caramel malt. 
T - 4.5 - Big on flavor for a Pale Ale. Light colored tropical fruit from start to finish, tartness nips the tip of the tongue and gives way to a sweet and spicy ruby grapefruit, papaya, and mangos and finishes off with an assertive pine grapefruit bitterness of an IPA.
M - 4.5 - Light medium body, sprightly carbonation, and a lingering piney, grapefruit finish.
O - 4.5 - A flavorful pale ale that drinks like an ipa without the higher ABV, hits the spot, nicely executed! 686 charactersjzeilinger, Dec 06, 2012

A: Pours lighter orange with white foam and lacing like crazy.
S: Citrus fruit, touch of pine, maybe some peach? Very nice. 
T: Follows the nose, citrus, hint of pine, juicy with a decent amount of malt and bitterness. I almost get a faint hint of rye, although it's not in this beer, it must be a similar hop/malt combo to another beer that I associate with rye.
M: Nicely carbonated, light body, again another HF beer that I could drink all night.
O: Very good beer, I don't like it as much as S&S5 or Susan but it's still awesome.
Something is familiar between the three hoppy HF beers I've tried but it's hard to put my finger on. I'm not sure if it's the malt, the water (my guess), or a particular hop (I don't think this is it) but the three HF beers all have a similar taste that I really like and isn't like many other beers. It's very slight but since HF beers are few and far between for me I'm really taking the time to analyze each one. I'm interested to see if this carries over into the saisons that are next up. 1,074 charactersAnnArborJoe, Dec 05, 2012

S: Very big, down right awesome for a 5.6% beer. It smells live a big, fresh liquid orchard ina glass, amazing; grapefruit, peaches, oranges, light lemon and pine. Splendid. 
T: Big fresh fruits upfront. What can I say? Excellent. Lots of fresh citrus, peaches, some hints of pin needles dance around the orchard fruits. A nice bitterness rides beneath all of the flavor. The finish is juicy, clean, dry and delicous.
M: Delicate carbonation, light body, lower ABV and immense taste leaves this beer so crushable yet something you want to sip and enjoy.
O: Most excellent. 756 charactersbarleywinefiend, Dec 02, 2012

Reviewing on the third pint over the past week...should have reviewed sooner. It's still fantastic but obviously the fresher the better.
A: Hazy, golden-yellow with a huge, soapy, bubbly, white head. It's an APA, after all.
S: Massive bursts of fresh, fruity, juicy hops. Citrus, pine, cedar, some spice, some booze, all balanced by a hint of malt at the back.
T: Incredibly fruity, floral, grassy, earthy, spicy, piney, woody, juicy hops. Not many other adjectives to use when describing fresh American hop cones. This APA showcases the power of the hop without being shy. An absolute dream to drink from first sip to last. Very happy I had the opportunity to drink 2L of this beer.
M: Naturally, the carbonation has diminished with each pint but it's still there as is the incredible smoothness that's been there since I popped open the growler. Creamy, thick, luscious body with a delicious lingering aftertaste of fresh hop oils.
O: My first and certainly not last beer from Hill Farmstead. As I can already tell, the hype is real. A nearly perfect version of the style and a great utilization of all the characteristics of hops that beer lovers cherish. You can taste all the ingredients and differentiate them as unique to this brewery. Incredible stuff. 1,362 charactersGatch, Nov 29, 2012

Very bright and hoppy aroma. Citrus hops (grapefruit, lemon) jump out with a little pine as well. Just a touch of caramel malt.
Tastes follows the aroma. Bright citrus fruits with a little cereal graininess to provide some backbone. Finishes a little drying while picking up some pine flavors. Nothing spectacular, but a very solid combo of hops and malt. Passed the bitterness taste with my IPA disliking companion, so definitely a great pale ale.
Medium to light bodied but with a wonderful creamy mouthfeel. Finishes somewhat dry with just a bit of resin on the back of the tongue.
A very solid pale ale. Pales in comparison to some of the other HF hoppy offerings, but still a pale ale, I'd be glad to order anytime. 825 charactersjmarsh123, Nov 13, 2012

Taste follows the nose, but has a nice bready malt backbone.
The feel is medium bodied with solid carbonation. Smooth, creamy, and extremely refreshing.

4.17/5  rDev -5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4On tap at the Farmhouse in Burlington. Pours hazy and shimmering orange with a small off-white head that settles slowly and leaves little patches of lace on the glass. Fresh hoppy aroma wafts up, citrus in front, pine and floral notes following. Little in the way of malt detected.
The flavor has slightly more malt presence, with subdued caramel and biscuit character and mild sweetness. Hops are front and center, again citrusy tangerine, orange, and grapefruit, with lesser pine and floral notes. Finishes dry with a very lightly lingering bitterness remaining. Overall a mild but flavorfull pale heavier on the aromatics than the taste.
Medium to slightly light bodied with smooth but clean carbonation. Elegant and totally drinkable. One could drink a lot of this one, a perfect candidate for a session, American style. Not as exciting as the HF IPAs perhaps, but more of an everyday drinker to be sure. 910 characterstobelerone, Oct 18, 2012

T: is much like the aroma, delicious hop flavor over a bready and lightly caramely malt backbone, deffinatly delicious. The hops give loads of citrus flavor, mango, citrus rind... Along with some nice, slightly resinous pine.... Never getting overly bitter, very nicley done.

A- Cloudy pour with a golden orange body into a 4oz taster glass, quite hazy. A frothy white head forms with a finger in size and retains decently. Good lace webs.
S- Nice hop presence right off the bat, not IPA level or over the top though. Notes of mango, citrus zest and fruits come to mind. Beyond that it is balanced by cereal grains, caramel and yeast bread.
T- Starts off like the nose with some great hop character. Pine and citrus rind make more noise here with some tropical fruit hints behind that. Balanced very nicely with notes of cracked grains, yeast bread and slight caramel sweetness.
Crisp lighter end body with a nice creamy substance to it. Nice carbonation level supports the flavors well. Clean bitterness in the finish.
Right where modern pale ales should be. Hoppy but balanced nicely by malt and yeast. Would probably buy a 12-pack of this bi-weekly if I could, I can dream. 1,057 characterscbutova, Oct 10, 2012

Pour: Completely hazy orange with a finger plus of sticky white head. Head leaves a little lacing, but not too much. 
Smell: Grapefruit and tangerine mostly, but with a nice bready, raw dough sweetness in the background. Not as in your face on the nose as other HF beers.
Taste: Huge burst of tangerine and mango, followed by a light resin and light doughy oat sweetness. Solid bitterness. Lingers with oranges.
Mouthfeel: This is so drinkable, definitely more so than Zombie Dust. Juiciness hangs around on the palate, but not in a cloying way whatsoever.

I'm not even sure where I had it first. I had never planned on reviewing it, or any other beer, but it's so good that I've decided to type about it.
Appearance: It looks fine to me. Like a glass of beer. The glasses they serve it in at Three Penny Taproom are great. Sort of like a pint glass, with the Hill Farmstead Logo. Honestly the glass is so nice, it does add something, I think.
Smell: It smells like it tastes, as far as I know. I sort of object to the idea of discounting points for relatively unimportant considerations like appearance, or even smell. As far as I know, it smells like heaven.
Taste: The taste is brilliant. Fresh. Hearty. Hoppy. It's like the best IPA ever.
Mouthfeel: My mouth feels absolutely fantastic when I'm drinking this beer.
Overall: 11.
When I see the detail that some people have put into their reviews, I almost feel apologetic that I haven't labored over the details more. Three Penny Taproom has a lot of great beers (24 taps), but I often get buyer's remorse if I get anything other than the Edward, including other Hill Farmstead beers. From what I've had, a Sixpoint Resin is the only thing close to the heavenly Edward, although a lot of the other Hill Farmstead beers aren't too far behind, like Citra and Abner, which are nice because they taste somewhat similar to the Edward. 
All of their beers taste fresh and flowery, that I've had.
From my experience, I've never had a beer with such a good finish as the Edward. In this respect, I think it does outclass the other Hill Farmstead beers I've had. There's just some kind of bonus in the after taste. Dry and inviting. It's such a hearty and delicious beer, and my favorite of all time. The challenge now is to find something comparable. I've never tried Pliny the Elder which I've read is really good. I've seen polls where the Dogfish Head 90 minute is listed as a top five beer. There is absolutely no comparison: the Edward is much, much better than the 90 minute, but then again, I think the 60 minute is better than the 90 minute.
Sorry to go off topic. This is my first and perhaps last review, and it's just odd that no one is giving the Edward all 5s. I see the tips on the side that all 5s are to be used rarely, but come on. If there was ever a beer that deserves it, it's this one. Otherwise it's misleading.
Update: Reading more reviews, it sounds like I would really like Zombie Dust. I'll ask Three Penny if they can get some of that. 2,574 characters433, Sep 14, 2012

A: Pours a murky, nearly opaque, soft peach body. Clearly unfiltered, which is something I usually criticize in APAs and IPAs. Forms a finger of off-white head that vanishes after about 30 seconds. Some register marks during the initial sips. 
S: Bright citrus pith: cantaloupe, honeydew melon, grapefruit. A touch of pine needle rounds out the back end. Very little malt character, with a small biscuit note throughout. 
T: That bright, beautiful citrus nose dominates the taste. Melon and grapefruit flesh lead the way, gradually segueing into pine needles. The aftertaste is moderately bitter, which the biscuit malt base does little to offset. The exhalation resurrects honeydew and brings some peach. Lovely. 
M: Medium-bodied; this feels a little heavier than most pale ales. But it cleans up well; bitterness lingers in the aftertaste for only a little while before falling off. No unpleasant stickiness. It makes the beer eminently drinkable. 
O: Russian River's Row 2, Alpine's Hoppy Birthday, and Three Floyds' Zombie Dust are probably the most popular pale ales on BA right now. This and Hill Farmstead's Citra should be in the conversation, as well. Superlative for the style. I feel almost like a broken record saying how good Hill Farmstead's hoppy beers are, but when it's true... 1,338 charactersArbitrator, Sep 13, 2012

A pale honey gold body is presented. Opaque, solid. With a real nice classic white creamy head that seems so common on Hill Farmstead beers. Pretty attractive.
Nose brings light hints of melon and cantalopue, with a bit of floral hints. Some lemon like citrus kicks in a bit too. Pretty nice.
Light bodied and quite a lively carbonated palate. Lime hop forward in the mid palate, with a real light toasty almost mix of burnt grain. Playful carbonation feel giving a hint of spicy pepper.
Overall real interesting beer, perhaps not as drawn to it, but it's quite a unique pale ale style beer by these guys and a very well crafted solid brew. 727 characterssmakawhat, Aug 24, 2012

4.88/5  rDev +11.2%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I had a couple proper pints of Hill Farmstead Edward (in an English pub-style nonic glass) at The Crop, a great new restaurant in Stowe, Vermont. Edward was the only HF beer they had on tap, but it was in excellent company–they had stuff by Ommegang, Green Flash, Lagunitas, and Rodenbach as well, and Alchemist Heady Topper in cans, as well. Review is from notes. 
Appearance (5/5): Edward pours a brilliant, opaque, deep orange hue with some yellow highlights when held up to the light. Very cloudy, due to it being completely unfiltered. A 1.5 inch, billowy, crown of off-white foam sits atop this beauteous nectar. Plenty of sticky lacing clings to the sides of the glass as you drink. This is absolutely the BEST LOOKING pale ale I have ever seen.
Smell (4.5/5): Edward smells very hoppy, hinting at a decidedly hop-centric flavor profile: sweet tropical fruit and piney hop notes dominate. Biscuity and bready notes can also be discerned, along with an interesting...buttery note (?). An excellent, excellent nose. 
Taste (5/5):This is most certainly one hoppy pale ale. Edward features serious complexity, though: the hops are fruity (grapefruit, passion fruit, and mango–flavors common to many hoppy Hill Farmstead beers), earthy, grassy, and deep. They are very nicely balanced by a biscuity malt backbone–as with the smell, notes of butter in there again. There is a lingering, dry bitterness that is refreshing and not overly astringent. Very impressive, and in my eyes, a perfectly executed hop-forward American Pale Ale. 
Mouthfeel (5/5): Edward is medium bodied and has a pleasing medium level of carbonation that compliments the hop bite and dryness of this beer. It is slightly creamy. Hop resins prickle and coat the tongue. All these factors make Edward a pleasure to drink. The low ABV (5.2%) means you can (must, really) have a couple of these whenever you see it. Drinkability is absurdly high. 
Overall (5/5): Hill Farmstead Edward is a superior American Pale Ale. Its delicious aroma, its exceptionally well-balanced fruity hop and biscuit malt flavors, and its out-of-this-world drinkability make it a true stand-out among not only beers of its style category, but among all the beers in the wide world of beerdom. Now, Edward may not be the most unusual or sought-after of Shaun Hill's fermented creations, but it certainly is one of the best and makes a great introduction to his other beers. Bravo, Hill Farmstead! 2,452 charactershagbergl, Aug 17, 2012

A- Pours a hazy dark brownish yellowish orange, slightly grapefruit colored but a little bit darker, decent carbonation, about half finger of head that receded fairly fast, nice layered lacing.
S- Citrus hops, light grapefruit, some pine, a little bit of lemon, caramel malts mixed with a little bit of pale malts.
T- Citrus hops, lemon, grapefruit, a tiny bit of pine, finishes with caramel malts, a tiny bit of pale malts, and some lemon zest and bitterness. Lingering aftertaste of citrus hops and pale malts.
M- Medium bodied, refreshing, slightly juicy, nice carbonation, very easy to drink.
O- This was a very nice pale ale, one of my favorites. The only one I would say is maybe a little bit better that I've had is Row 2/Hill 56. Has a very nice hop taste for a pale ale and is very well balanced between the citrus hops and caramel/pale malts. I will definitely be drinking this one again. Definitely recommend trying it if you get the chance. 1,165 charactersjaasen64, Aug 17, 2012

Sweet citrus up front, orange flavours. Nice clean malt flavours through the middle. Hops and malt combine in the finish to make it dangerouslt moreish. 
I love being surprised by an APA. Brewers in the US have mastered the style, and even the efforts from mediocre breweries are usually nice enough. Hill Farmstead's Edward focuses on freshness to make a quenching APA, with very little of the resinous bitterness that sometimes blurs the lines between this style and AIPAs. 602 charactersCanuckRover, Aug 11, 2012

Intense aroma of tropical fruits (pinneaple, grapefruit, mango puree), spicy and grassy hops. Taste is simply amazing. A rush of grassy and piny hops with subtle caramel malts and some grapefruit skin. Awesome hop profile. I thought it was very robust for an IPA before I read the menu and found out it was an APA. 392 charactersLuk13, Aug 06, 2012
4.13/5  rDev -5.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.51 liter growler into Duvel tulip. Bought from the brewery a week ago (consuming now).
Appearance: Free pour yields a 1.5 inch fluffy white head that dissipates steadily. Pours a glowing opaque yellow orange and leaves tons of lacing everywhere. One of those "walls of lacing" beers, nice.
Smell: Slight piny-ness, and kind of an orange / grapefruit grove thing happening. Smells citrusy and outdoorsy. Not an explosion of hops, but a very bright, fresh aroma. Bit of banana/melon-y aroma that Hill Farmstead seems to get into every hoppy beer that I have hitherto been unable to wring out of hops myself.
Taste: Orange juice, with mild weed pungency and mango highlights, as well as a nice hop bitterness. Bitterness kind of gives way to an indistinct toasted malt backbone. Finishes very clean, with a tiny bit of lingering sweetness.
Bitterness eventually starts to take on a strong grapefruit pith character as the citrus hop notes build up (the beer is at times uncannily similar to drinking orange juice or eating a grapefruit). That same melon I love can be tasted underneath everything, but the primary flavor is citrus. There's a sweetness that I think is coming from a higher-than-expected percentage of crystal malt. Large crystal malt additions are generally an unwelcome guest in non-barleywine hop forward beers (even in barleywines, actually), but here the sweetness puts a nice balancing touch on the juicy, citrusy hop flavor. 
Par for the course with Hill Farmstead: a well thought out, delicious tasting beer.
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied. Very juicy. Moderate carbonation. Not particularly dry or crisp, but finishes clean.
Overall: My first thought about this beer was "There really is no difference between American Pale Ale and American IPA nowadays, is there?" As I made my way through the first glass though, I started to appreciate all these beautiful little details that wouldn't necessarily make sense in a full on IPA (the lack of dryness, the high--at least perception-wise--amount of crystal malt), playing well alongside IPA staples (high but satisfying bitterness, American citrusy hop-centric flavor highlighted by a variety of interesting hop flavors--mango, pine, melon, weed). 
In the end, I felt the beer to be a really subtle affair, unique and immensely satisfying. It rewards careful attention, yet also hits the spot if you just need a good, soul-satisfying pale ale--the hallmark of a great beer. 2,442 charactersPahn, Aug 06, 2012

The nose is herbal and catty with pine from the hops. There is some mild straw grain inclusion breaking things up a bit but for the most part the aromatics are all about the hops.
The taste is the same with pulpy zest and rind elements that are more flavorful than they are bitter. The bitterness is modestly pleasing and leaves enough room for a bit of straw like grain inclusion to poke through.
This is a med bodied brew with a modest level of carbonation. It is very easy drinking and worth checkin out. I would have this again if presented with the opportunity. 711 charactersstakem, Aug 02, 2012

A: This one is hazy, light copper in color, with only a bit of amorphous white foam floating on top - no true head. Minimal visible carbonation.
S: Tropical fruit, grass, orange, caramel malt.
T: Tropical fruit and dank bitter grapefruit hop flavors primarily. These very nearly overwhelm any flavor from the malt - maybe a bit of bready malt if I really use my imagination.
M: Nice mouthfeel, not a lot of carbonation but tingly from all the hops. No alcohol presence. Bitter hang that lasts.
O: Good, but for my preference it's overly bitter with no sweetness as a counterpoint. That being said, I did enjoy it & would have it again. 719 charactersmacrosmatic, Jul 11, 2012

First HFB glass pours with a 3/4" off-white head, over the cloudy peach-hued brew. Frothy head pops away, with excellent lacing. Aroma is tangerine with a light undercurrent of sweet. 
Taste continues the tangerine presence for me, an initial sweetness which promptly cedes the baton to the juicy fruitiness. Closes with a sedate bitterness and a touch of pine. Mouthfeel is soft and smooth, and drinkability is very good. Another thirst-quenching brew here from Hill Farmstead. 525 charactersppoitras, Jul 10, 2012

A slightly burnt, golden orange body with a creamy, two+ finger cap. The head fell slowly, in raindrop fashion, clinging to the sides of the glass as it fell.
The nose is grassy, floral with citrus and pine. Grapefruit, oranges, and lemons with some light tropical fruits hanging back. Fresh flowers. A sturdy pale malt bill props up these hops.
More balanced than I expected. Pine resin and citrus up front. Pale malt works through mid-palate before fresh cut flowers, pine and citrus return for the finish.
Medium body, creamy. Well-balanced.
I was impressed with the depth of the hop profile and how damn balanced this is. A good sturdy APA, without the sticky caramel of others in the style. 725 charactersColForbinBC, Jun 27, 2012

The color is an orange/gold with two fingers of foamy white head and some nice lacing left on the glass.
The smell is pretty fruity with some hops coming out first then letting the aroma of peach mix a little tangerine. A floral aroma also comes out toward the end and makes the nose pretty inviting.
The taste is hoppy with a decent bitter pine flavor that is none too strong. The hops are pronounced but more mellow then some hop forward beers I have tried. The malts come out with some biscuit flavor that balances things a bit. The hops lend some orange or grapefruit flavor as things ease back into a slight bitter flavor toward the end.
The feel of this beer is pretty well balanced and easy drinking. There is a medium body to this beer that seems to glide through your palate. A well made beer. 844 charactersDuhast500, Jun 25, 2012

Two thick fingers of white fluff rides atop a lush orange base. Plenty of stick and stay. Looks nice.
Smell is predominantly juicy peach, which while the texture of peaches makes my skin crawl the flavor and smell of the flesh touch my happy places. That is found here in spades. A sticky nectary quality oozes throughout the nose and while not overly diverse, it smells delicious.
The taste shows more depth than the nose. More white nectarine than peach at the start. Middle shows fresh cut grass that's supported by a malt profile of sourdough bread. The end is tongue coating bitterness that dries the palate, leaving a lingering prickle on the tongue.
Hop oils play a massive role in the feel of Edward. Carbonation is low. The oily nature of this is a bit distracting and is, if you can term it such, the only real flaw of this beer.
Considering my evening consisted of enjoying a fresh growler of this beer while alternatively having my week old twins asleep on my lap, I'd say life is pretty good. 1,144 charactersBarrytheBear, Jun 20, 2012

Score: 90
Three week old 750 ml growler served in a Half Acre tulip and enjoyed on 04/09/12. Review is from notes.
Appearance: Pours an opaque golden-orange color with a golden halo outline and pulpy orange core when held up to light. A finger-plus of creamy off-white head at pour settles almost entirely, leaving behind streaky lacing on the of the glass. Good lacing, decent retention. 4/5
Smell: Lemon pinesol, grapefruit and orange. Fresh pine, a touch of sap and a little candied tropical fruit. 4/5
Taste: Orange and pine up front. Very "hops oil" forward on the tongue. A little caramel, juicy orange and lemon. A growing amount of sweet-and-sour lemonade flavor on the midpalate. A think I detect a hint of "stainless steel" flavor in the aftertaste when the beer hits room temperature, but neither of my two friends who are sharing this growler with me concur with that assertion. Ample juicy citrus behind the piney hops. 4/5
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, light carbonation. Oily mouthfeel. I feel like the flavor profile could have benefited from more carbonation here. 3.5/5
Overall: Super solid pale ale from Hill Farmstead, but it did not quite stack up to the other hoppy beers of theirs that I have tried. I will have to try a fresher bottle of this next time.
Recommendation: Fans of Sierra Nevada's pale ale will enjoy this one thoroughly.
Pairings: The vegetarian goat cheese burrito from Burrito Beach.
Cost: $7 for a 750 ml growler or $15 for a 2 liter growler (plus the deposit). 1,561 charactersjegross2, May 28, 2012

Thanks, AdamJackson!
Very slightly hazed golden yellow with a moderately sized near-white head that leaves dots of lace down the glass.
The aroma is a nice combination of floral and citrus hop components. This doesn't bash you over the head like other hoppy pale ales, but what's here is very nice. Complete, earth, hoppy aroma.
The flavor too is quite nice, with only a moderate level of bitterness accompanied by earthy, citrus, and floral hop character, along with enough of a bready malt backbone.
Medium bodied with moderate/high carbonation.
A very nice, straightforward, classic, incredibly drinkable pale ale. 650 charactersehammond1, May 15, 2012

Appearance: A good 2-finger head, so white it'll make you blind. Foamy, bubbly, appetizing. Classic hazy Farmstead look- pale orange. Great retention, the head is here to stay!
Smell: Not so amazing here, but good enough. Piney, dry, resiny. Reminds of a pine forest in Spain after a fire. Lemon confit, cough drops. 
Taste: Shit this is fresh! Bubbly citrus right away. Slightly soapy but nice, dry finish. Pineapple, some sweetness, super tropical. Mild-but-assertive hoppiness. I wanna drown in this!
Mouthfeel: Super refreshing, well balanced. Nice dry finish. Great carbonation. The flavor profile is just fantastic!
Overall: A truly exceptional beer, and with a fresh keg like this- holy shit. Drinkable beyond belief, delicious. An American treasure! 810 charactersDoubleSimcoe, May 14, 2012

Smell is very floral, with only a hint at a caramel backbone. Citrus peel and hops galore.
Beer is well integrated with citrus and bitter hops. Everything (grapefruit, lemon and hops) are very well tied in together but not one of these elements stands out specifically. 
This beer is as well-balanced as you can get. Carbonation, bitterness, floral notes and citrus mingle perfectly together.

This beer pours a medium bodied and very cloudy apricot orange in color with a one finger soapy head. The nose is essentially clean citrusy hops through and through. There is orange and tangerine everywhere. It's citrusy chaos haha. The flavors too are 100% citrusy hops. I can't get away from Minute Maid. It's hard, really hard to pick out anything else so i can't say the nose or flavors are incredibly complex. It drinks medium in body and moderately dry. It has nice flavor and I could drink a lot of it. It is just that it's an all out orange assault on your senses without much depth. 667 charactersaasher, May 01, 2012

The aroma isn't as strong as I thought it would be. It seems more malty than hoppy. Pale malt and apricot notes are balanced with orange citrus and lemon rind.
Each sip of this medium bodied beer is slick on the palate; feels soft and watery. The flavor is excellently balanced between sweet pale malt and citrus hops. It starts with light malt and fruit (apricot, tropical fruit) before hoppy grass and citrus notes move in. It finishes with a mild bitterness and once gone the bitter citrus and pale malt linger on the palate.
This is a fantasticly well balanced beer. Not too hoppy, not too malty. Very easy to drink. 808 charactersWanderingFool, Apr 28, 2012

This review is applies to recent tastings at Reservoir (Waterbury, VT), and Hill Farmstead (Greensboro, VT).
Served in a signature HF stem glass, Edward poured a murky golden-apricot color with a small bubbly white head; decent retention and lacing. Nice aroma of fresh hops, citrus and grass. Fresh, crisp blast of all kinds of citrus in the taste, juicy hops, bitter in the finish; biscuity malt base as a distant afterthought. Even though considered an APA, I say this one is pretty comparable to higher end IPAs like Pliny the Elder. Medium body, full of flavor and highly drinkable, for an excellent beer overall. 654 charactersRifugium, Apr 24, 2012

O - Wonderful Pale Ale. This is probably the best Pale ale I have had next to Zombie Dust . I just wish you could get this easier. In bottles also. But since that probably isn't going to happen I'll have to enjoy it on Tap when I see it around Town. This was my first Hill Farmstead beer and I want to try them all now.

A - Super hazy orange in body. Looks very much like Blue Moon for easy reference. Fluffy white head. This one's a looker. Photo of the pour. http://tinyurl.com/74ns3g9
S - Citrus rind, grapefruit, mango. Awesome aroma. Could be a bit more pungent, but then again it's only a Pale. 
T - Follows the nose. Big citrus notes with clean grapefruit. A touch or mango-style fruit note. Malt backbone cleans everything up. Outstanding. 
M - Great creamy texture. Not sure how Hill Farmstead conditions their beers but this works perfectly. 
O - Just a fantastic Pale Ale. If you were to make Zombie Dust more bitter and flavorful, you would end up with Edward. Very similar notes and flavors, just a bit more pronounced. Absolutely wonderful. 797 charactersDevilsCups, Apr 13, 2012

Poured into a 12 oz goblet
A: Extremely hazy golden orange body with a creamy, fluffy white head. Really wonderful sticky lacing on the walls and a nice retention circle around the edge with minor patches. Not what I expected for a Pale Ale, especially the very cloudy nature of it.
S: Big citrus fruits, orange, mango, papaya and peach. Hints of earthy bitter hops come through, along with a very nice floral element. Clean aroma with lots of big notes.
T: Nothing but juicy citrus hops and fruits up-front. More orange and mango mostly which quickly turns into a bitter floral flavor. Back of the palate brings some pale malts with a hint of peach lingering around. Very flavorful for being a lower ABV beer, and certainly one of the best tasting in the style.
M: Creamy, smooth with just the right amount of carbonation. This has the mouth feel down essentially perfectly for a Pale Ale. It's not too thin or full, but the creaminess is something you don't see often.
Easily my favorite Pale Ale I've tried to date. This had a wonderful mouth feel and the flavors were so prominent, citrusy and juicy which is just what I like. Great stuff once again from Hill Farmstead. 1,214 charactersShanePB, Apr 12, 2012

4.65/5  rDev +5.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Presentation: 2L growler poured into a pint glass. Served chilled in the refrigerator on the same day it was filled in a Hill Farmstead fliptop. 
Appearance: Pours a really aggressive, two finger, foamy white head with really nice retention. Cloudy orange to pale yellow in color. 
Aroma: Really nice tropical hop notes dominate the aroma. Nice citrus, pine and mango really provide a really aromatic background. Not a ton of malt sweetness in there, but it is still incredibly complex.
Taste: Citrus notes again dominate the taste. Lots of tropical fruit, mango and pineapple throughout. Really complex hop flavors balance the sweetness and bitterness really well. Definitely on the verge of being an IPA. Really easy to drink.
Mouthfeel: Really light bodied and crisp. The definition of easy to drink.
Overall, the best pale ale I've ever had, bar none. Simple, fresh, hoppy and really flavorful. Easy to drink and complex. I have had this four or five times without reviewing it and every time I enjoy it immensely. Definitely deserving of its reputation. 1,063 charactersGosox8787, Apr 08, 2012

A- edward pours a bright hazy yellow with a fantastic head of white foam floating on top of the glass. Maybe one of the brighter pale ales I have seen
S- a whack of of pine and citrus that becomes really forward with a tangerine citruc scent being massively forward. Very bright and refreshing
T- absolutely fantastic! Bitter and sweet as the citric flavors are massive for a bulk of the taste. Edward really is a real tropical brew. One of the best pale ales I can remember for quite some time
M- well carbonated and crisp on the tongue. The flavor is prickly on the tongue and makes for a good feel
O- Unbelievable pale ale from hill farmstead. The bitter and sweet flavors of citrus and pine made this one heck of a brew. Now I see what all the excitement is about for hill farmstead 834 characterslovindahops, Apr 01, 2012
4/5  rDev -8.9%look: 3 | smell: 3 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Very hazy, almost murky with a good head and retention. Not much by the way of lacing but looks hoppy alright. Aroma is nothing special, mostly residual sweetness and such. Something something sweet citrus. Unimpressed for the most part although the slight dankness is finally doing it for me.
Taste kills it. Goddamn this is a great tasting pale ale that's quite different from any other I have had. It has elements of rind, it's very bitter or at least the perceived bitterness is up there, and it's dry. That's all I ask for. Fuck, I don't think I can recall beers that have been as "drinkable" as this.

very hoppy aroma giving plenty of pine, fresh cut grass, grapefruit and citrus, with a floral kick. 
follows the nose being very hoppy, but not bitter. juicy and refreshing with tons of citrus and an herbal, slightly peppery kick that makes it finish quite dry. some pale malt sweetness lies behind everything.
lighter side of medium bodied with ample carbonation and a slightly resiny feel left behind, but little bitter aftertaste.
as an APA, I don't think there is one better. Maine Beer Co.'s Peeper is close though. almost in IPA territory. 647 characterssilentjay, Mar 02, 2012

S/T - Assertive pine hops up front, with grapefruit notes coming in after. Little malt aroma/flavor until it warms up a bit, then a nice caramel malt backbone provides a nice balance for the hops.
M - Thick body, medium carbonation, doesn't finish as crisp as I like in an APA, but does dry out. Very bitter for the style, which I do like.
O - Really drinks like an IPA more than a standard pale. Regardless, its delicious, hoppy, and bitter. Excellent take on the style, glad I had the opportunity to have it. 596 charactersgaruda, Feb 29, 2012

Poured a murky copper hue with a one and a half ding frothy white head. There was very good retention and lacing. 
The smell featured waves of resinous citrus and pine. 
The taste consisted of a full piney hop atop a subtle soft pale malt. There was a nice lightly sweet doughiness at the finish along with a lingering bitterness. 
The mouthfeel was toward the fuller side of the style.

Appeared rusty amber in color. Foggy. A cap of white head stuck around until the head. 
Its smell offers earthy bread and earthy hops, with some citrus. I get the sense simcoe is in it. Right off the bat I can tell this is a more robust pale ale than other pale ales. The flavor is full and balanced with noticeable bread like malts and hops that offer fruit, grass, and bittersweetness on the back of the tongue. What's amazing iis the mouthfeel and body - very full and texturous for a pale ale. Creamy, even. A breeze to drink yet satisfyingly filling. 
If this was readily available this would be my go-to pale ale. It raises the bar for the style. 694 charactersjbertsch, Feb 04, 2012

Reviewed from Notes
A: hazy orange with half inch head, lots of lacing, very pretty, very hazy
N: world class nose, pine, pineapple, grapefruit, tropical over drive
T: lives up to the other-worldly nose, plenty of hop flavor, but not a ton of bitterness on the back-end (which I usually see with really hopped up low ABV beers), malt profile manages to live up the hops, but not a whole of lot of the biscuity malt profile that's more common to the style. Truly a superb beer that doesn't really conform to the APA style and is all the better for it. An IPA in hiding.
M: extremely quaffable, extremely. the mouthfeel is smooth with plenty of carbonation to make this beer heavenly to drink.
O: the best APA I've ever had. maybe my favorite beer ever. with this amount of flavor and hop aroma at 5.2%, this beer lives up to the hype and haunts my dreams 917 charactersmodernartblues, Jan 21, 2012

Strong aroma of pine/fresh cut grass along with tropical fruits like mango. I also get some melon, tangerine, and a little grapefruit. Very nice.
Taste starts off exactly like the smell- initial hit of pine, grass and grapefruit rind. Then the tropical fruit flavors come- mango and melon along with tangerine. I taste some biscuit/bread flavor from the malt. Pretty hoppy for a pale ale and I like it. Very nicely balanced as well.
Mouthfeel is light to medium with some low carbonation. Dry finish with some bitterness but nothing over the top. 
One of the best tasting pale ales I have had- like an IPA with no detectable alcohol flavor. I thought the beer could use some more carbonation but it wasn't a big deal. Great, complex flavors and very nicely balanced. I could drink a lot of this stuff. 948 charactersDubber55, Jan 08, 2012

The aroma has a bright, juicy, fresh citrus hoppiness to it. I get some bitter citrus rind and grapefruit mixing with some juicier, fruitier notes of orange, peach and pineapple. Fantastic aroma overall.
The taste also shows a lot of hoppiness to it throughout the flavor. I again get some very nice tropical fruit notes to it that I love. Towards the finish more of the bitter, citrus rind and grapefruit flavors come out. I get a little bit of a malty, slightly caramel presence in it as well, but the hops definitely steal the show. 
The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation being a little below average. Overall it was a great beer and a fantastic APA. At 5.2% it still had enough hoppy flavors to match or beat a lot of DIPA's. Extremely easy drinking and flavorful for the style and abv%.

A: This beer pours a hazy, hazy copper color with a one finger of creamy white head. Head recedes at a nice pace leaving sheets of lacing on the glass.
S: Nose is complex. Fruity - some mango and pineapple...sweet - definite caramel notes, and bitter - grapefruit is definitely present.
T: Taste starts with a big bitter grapefruit, lemon zest to it. Some pale malts start to ease the palate before a touch of caramel sweetness comes in. Orange peel comes through and completely dominates the finish.

Mildly hazy (I'm surprised there's a little sediment in the growler!), this beer is a dull orange with a dense, off-white head with excellent retention and lacing. The nose is excellent. Bright, fruity, juicy with a melange of tropical and citrus fruits, there's ripe clementines, pineapple, a little mango and a touch of grapefruit. There's also a slight minty component, also from the hops (I'm guessing). A mild malt backbone is present, with a mildly doughy, bready character. 
The flavors on the palate are enjoyable, but not quite as good as the nose would suggest. While present in copious amounts, the hop flavor seems slightly dulled and dare I say, a little oxidized? As with the nose, the flavor leans heavily on the fruity hops. Mango, clementines and grapefruit lend plenty of flavor, and the bitterness is low. The Cascade (dry hop?) character is particularly noticeable. The malt character is clean, cracker-like, mildly doughy and unobtrusive. Drying on the finish with a lingering hop flavor (particularly the citrus) and a mildly resiny (and gorgeous) bitterness. Light in body with soft, gentle carbonation that's perfect for the style, this beer is extremely enjoyable. I'm glad to have tried it, but I have a feeling this batch is just a touch old. 1,384 charactersDefenCorps, Dec 01, 2011
4.7/5  rDev +7.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Easily one of the best East Coast Pale Ales I've had as of late. Ridiculously fruity nose of pineapple, grapefruit and passion fruit....initially thought there were Galaxy hops involved, but the profile on the Hill Farmstead site claims otherwise. Tastes similar to a citrus-forward IPA a'la Flower Power, but the 5.2 abv means you can easily drain multiple pints without wanting to fall over...it almost feels like cheating. Magnifique. 437 charactersdmgnyc, Nov 30, 2011

Review taken from notes.
This beer pours a nice slightly hazy golden copper color. It has a nice finger of white head on it. The head has good retention, and it leaves behind a nice sheet of lace on the glass. The nose smells of floral and citrus hops. There are some tropical fruit aromas here as well as a bit of caramel. The taste has a nice citrus flavor with some caramel in background. There is a nice hop flavor that gives a good amount of bitterness. There is a nice bit of pineapple and other tropical fruit flavors. The finish leaves some fruit flavors and hop bitterness lingering on the palate. This has a medium body and good carbonation. It goes down easy and has a nice smooth feel to it. There is a nice amount of hop bitterness here, with some nice fruity sweetness that gives it nice balance. This has really good drinkability. I would have no problem downing a bunch of glasses of this throughout an evening. Overall, I think it is a really nice solid Pale Ale. The hop presence is really nice, as are the tropical fruit flavors. I really enjoyed this beer, and I would recommend trying it out. I don't think you'll be disappointed. 1,209 charactersJizackFH, Nov 23, 2011

4.17/5  rDev -5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4My last brew before the CBS raffle and I wasn't about to pass up my first shot at a Hill Farmstead beer.
A- Very hazy, turbid gold brew. Crackly white large head. Yellow and orange hues. There also looks to be a film to the texture of this beer in the glass.
S- A fine bouquet to this pale ale of lemon, lime, citrus, orange peel and alpine needles. Lots of floral notes in here which leads me to believe there was some good dry hopping. Very fresh hop scents.
T- Nice & bitter. Mostly citrus, with lemons and piney hops. There's also some honey suckle in this beer which is different yet delicious.
M- Medium bodied pale ale with medium carbonation. Lip smacking is repeated throughout drinking due to bitterness.
O- Great smell, great bitterness, and taste. All qualities in this beer you would expect from an IPA rather than a pale ale. So smooth and so drinkable. I can't wait to try more from HF. 906 charactershaazer, Nov 14, 2011

4.17/5  rDev -5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4On-tap at the Blackback Pub in Waterbury. Served in a stemmed Hill Farmstead glass.
Cloudy, unfiltered and golden. Head is small and leaves nice lacing down the glass (Their glasses remind me more of wine glasses than tulips; they're interesting).
Smells like pineapple/mango/grapefruit hops, lightly sweet.
Taste is same as the nose, with a similar hop profile to Abner but much more subdued. Tropical fruits and citrus in the flavor, no real malt and no real bitterness that gets you. There's a watery lightness to this. Flavorful for the low ABV, though.
Mouthfeel is light and easy-going. I don't normally give mouthfeel much notice, but I like the way Hill Farmstead does it.
This is like an IPA light or a session IPA. It tastes great and works if you're looking for the HF hop profile without a stronger beer. On my rare chances to get HF beers, though, I'm more apt to try something bigger. 903 charactersmusicforairports, Oct 19, 2011
4.32/5  rDev -1.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Had this on 2011-10-15 at Capone's in Norristown, PA at a HIll Farmstead event and again on 2011-10-19 at Al'sof Hampden in Enola, PA.
A - Cloudy golden-amber with a 1-finger head and mild lacing into a 13 oz tumbler.
S - Tropical and orange fruit, some caramel malt, mild pine, hop floral. It's not as strong smelling as the Abner or the even stronger Ephraim, but once it warmed a bit, it had a very good malt, fruit and pine aroma.
T - The malt is quite noticeable and reminded me of a Zwieback cracker. The other flavors are a citrus tartness, a little yeast, fresh hops and significant pine. The finish is dry, bright, slightly sour/tart-citrus and a combination of lemon and grapefrutit bitterness. Very nice. 
M - Light body and medium-high carbonation. Crisp, mildly resinous, refreshing. 
O - Very good. I think it could pass for an IPA. Reminds me of a Three Floyds Alpha King Pale Ale. It's more bitter than a Sierra Nevada Pale Ale. Wish this was available every day in PA. Good stuff.
This beer was the 4th (and last) to run out at the Capone'sevent. 1,069 charactersTucquan, Oct 17, 2011
4.32/5  rDev -1.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4On-tap at Al's.
A: The pale ale, my first run-in with a hoppy Hill Farmstead brew, is either a brigher golden color or a thicker autumnal brown. The either/or depends on whether we're talking the pint from last night or the pint from today. I'm guessing that today's pour is nearing the end of the keg... A thin white head is all there is.
S: The nose is grapefruity, a rich citrus thickness that wafts out of my glass with a pleasant bite. This pale ale packs a mean wallop, smelling very nice.
T: The citrus is fresh, newly squeezed oranges and grapefruits, all coagulating in my glass. The hops smell, and taste, fresh with plenty of juicy bitterness coming along. Lighter malts, a bit of caramel and a bit of biscuit, don't get in the way. The balance crowds out any boozy heat that may be lingering, leaving a very good pale ale behind. The grapefruit bite is very good.
M: Clean and hoppy, Edward doesn't skimp on the hops. From the first sniff to the last sip, I was in love. Too bad -- no growler fills... 1,017 charactersakorsak, Oct 16, 2011
4.26/5  rDev -3%look: 3 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3 |  overall: 4.58 or so oz. pour into a plastic cup at Hawthorne's "Ales for Tails event." Reviewed from notes. 
Pours a hazy, murky red, not unlike an amber ale. Sub-optimal glassware aside, there's a small white head that dissipates rather quickly. Minimal lacing.
Huge, huge aroma from this beer. The hop profile is excellent, with heavy notes of lemons and other citrus fruits. It's quite grassy, with a nice pine scent as well. Silly as it may sound, it's a very pure and "natural" smell.
The hoppiness of this beer is just remarkable given the ABV. Very assertive bitterness, with enough malt sweetness to balance things out. There's a bready, biscuit quality that reminds me of bread, complemented by big floral notes throughout the taste. 
Mouthfeel is fine, if a little undercarbonated. A touch more life would make this beer far more drinkable.
Really delicious, and a pretty incredible beer given the ABV. I could easily see this being a summer staple if Hill Farmstead does indeed make its way to Boston. 1,005 charactersamphion1065, Oct 12, 2011

Scent is of juicy and fruity hops with grapefruit, tangerine and pineapple the stars, perfect levels of biscuity malt sweetness in the backbone. Taste follows the amazing scent, fruity and juicy, full flavored (this is a pale ale? stronger than many IPAs!) without being overly bitter. Medium bodied, smooth and lightly creamy, great carbonation. Hands down the best pale ale on the market. A great intro to the brewery a few days before the full visit. 553 charactersrfgetz, Oct 10, 2011

Nose has great hops, citrus, grapefruit, tropical fruit, light floral and juicy hops, hint of musty resin.
taste brings juicy fruity hops, lots of tropical fruit, citrus, grapefruit, tangerine, peach, this would make that fruit I met in P-town feel like a dried fruit, light sweet silky smooth malts. Theres a light wheat vanilla but fruity like soft flavor in there I can't put my finger on. Finishes pretty bitter with soft luscious malts, lots more soft tropical fruits and citrus fresh hops without the oily flavor. This is delicious!
Mouth is med bodied, good carb, nice silky smooth like malt feel too.
Overall just awesome. Great hops, nice soft smooth malt, great tropical fruits without the big oily resinous kick, not super hoppy or super bitter, and malts are not only kept in check, but have a really nice flavor addition with that silky smooth malt kick, I wish I knew how they did it. 1,083 charactersjlindros, Oct 07, 2011

S - Super amazing aroma. Great tropical apart notes...my goodness. Mangos my god. Slight bitterness and citrus. Tropical galore.
T - More of the amazing nose. A sheer palette assault of sunny tropical mango. Sweet zombie jesus. Not that bitter just glorious tropical hops. Light candy malts..dammit the tropics!
M - Smooth creamy nice carbonation. Super inviting.
O - Overall this was insanely good. So juicy and tropical. To quote a film, I want to freeze this in winter and skate on it, then thaw it in summer and drink it. 703 charactersrudzud, Oct 06, 2011

Another treat from Hill Farmstead.
Good looking pint of beer. A somewhat creamy off white head sits atop a slightly hazy peach/orange/amber colored beer. Rings of lace line the glass.
Very nice aroma that certainly screams hops, but also hints to a nice balance ahead (yes, it delivered on this) Juicy citrus, slight green grass and a whiff of light toasted malt..
Wonderful balanced Pale Ale. I could drink this all day long. Frankly, I would love a keg of this for the house. Really a testament to a balanced beer with a nice hop presence. Fruit in front.. Lots of nice bread flavors in the rear. A consistent and wonderful hop bitterness from front to back. This beer screams fresh…. The bread flavors are so inviting it’s wonderful. A touch of yeast at the end.
Really feels unfiltered. I want to say gritty, but I don’t want it to sound like a negative. It isn’t.. Opposite of slick. Just a hint of carbonation.
What a great pale ale. The freshness is unreal. Balance, flavor and feel. Well done. 1,069 charactersReagan1984, Sep 13, 2011
4.24/5  rDev -3.4%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 412oz pour in a tall thin glass at the Rattle n Hum.
Edward pours a nearly solid (opaque) orange, with a thin bit of white foam sitting atop the beer. That little head is definitely spunky, it sticks around longer than I would have expected, but it only leaves a tiny bit of lacing. The nose is absolutely wonderful, dank with grapefruit, pineapple, and orange aromas. Forget IPAs, this bad boy is more pungent than some imperial IPAs that I've had. There's a brief flash of cracker maltiness at the front of each sip, before some (but not all) of the hoppy goodness hinted at by aroma is delivered. There's also a bit of an off aftertaste that I usually associate with Simcoe hops that lingers for a second after each sip. The body is a bit on the light side, appropriate for the style, yet still sturdy enough not to be completely overrun by the hops. The carbonation is just a little off though, the beer falls dull by the time it reaches the back of my palate. Still though, Edward is one of the better American Pale Ales I've had, and an excellent choice for someone who wants a serious hop fix within a lower ABV beer. 1,124 charactersaxeman9182, Sep 05, 2011

4.29/5  rDev -2.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25On-tap at The Farmhouse in Burlington, VT
Appearance: Hazy gold with a crazy white head. Lacing is intense and sticks to everything. A faint carbonation pulls throughout.
Smell: Loads of grapefruit, pine, and weed. A nice tropical hop touch lingers on the top and screams mango.Pineapple and tangerine. Ripe and juicy.  I'm sensing some Citra action here. Biscuity malts come from behind the strong hop nose and add some sweetness to the whole thing. Soft yeast profile with some fruity esters. Balanced approach with hops and malts playing well. Pine needle bitterness.
Taste: Big juicy hop explosion melds with a softer, almost biscuity, malt base. Faintly sweet pale malts. Toasted homemade white bread. Solidly tropical on the front with a dank weed flavor and a solid pine needle bitterness. Tangerine and some pineapple with touches of peach and mango. Lingering pithy, bordering on aspirin, bitterness.  As it warms the malts up their game a touch and round out the profile. Ends up balanced outside of the lingering bitterness. 
Mouthfeel: Ever so slightly dry. Moderate carbonation. Smooth and slightly creamy. Medium body. Exactly what you would expect from Hill Farmstead.
Overall: A solid APA. Bitter and easy drinking. Actually sits a bit too bitter on the finish and it impacts the general flavor on subsequent sips. Incredibly drinkable regardless. 1,368 charactersGoblinmunkey7, Aug 23, 2011

This looks gorgeous. Slightly cloudy, yellowy gold like an afternoon sunset hues floating around in there. Really creamy off-white head composed of giant loose lazy bubbles and leaves excellent lacing and has fantastic legs.
Smells citrusy... Like hugely citrusy. Perhaps I'm thinking some citra hops used in this one? Definitely a combo of the big C's American hops to give a lot of grapefruit punch. It's clean and crisp.
Little bit of malt, but it's not sweet-- it's dry, allowing the hops to shine.
The finish has a great dry bitterness with tons of hop flavor still.
This is a beer I can absolutely sit and drink all day. This is spectacular. If this were on tap around me, I would stop out regularly to grab a pint... But it's also a beer that I could totally kill a growler solo.
The body has a bit of an oily feel on the back end but it is well-carbonated with a general prickly feel.
Well-done. This is the best of the HF beers I've had. Hands down. 1,093 charactersAleWatcher, Aug 19, 2011

A - Pours a mirky golden yellow, nice white frothy head, very sticky lacing, thin filmy cap, thick collar.
S - Light hoppy bitterness, lots of pine, slight floral and tropical citrus notes. Very mellow but still lots going on, just the way I like my IPAs.
T - More hoppy/bitter then the nose suggests. Pine, tropical citrus, slight herbal/floral notes that really adds nicely to the bitterness. Not overdone or trying to be an IPA, it's just right and exactly what I want. Light hoppy, slightly floral finish.
M - Light, crisp and refreshing, perfect carbonation, clean finish.
O - As far as APA's go, this one is really hard to beat. It's amongst the class of Alpine Hoppy Birthday and Russian River Parking Violation, my two favorites. It's good out of a growler, but on-tap, it's at the top of its class. If you're in Chicago, come on by for a pint (while it lasts!). 990 charactersSean9689, Aug 19, 2011

Taste: pineapple, tropical fruit, citrus hops, and light toasted malt in the back to balance the beer out nicely
Mouthfeel: medium carbonation, light bodied, slightly bitter with some sweetness built in.
Overall: Another Hill Farmstead beer where the citrus just jumps. If all hops jumped like this, I could turn into a hop head. This certainly tastes more like a well crafted IPA than a pale ale. It may be my favorite pale ale. This is a bitter beer, but not overly so. Just really flavorful. 662 characterstigg924, Aug 14, 2011

A: Very pretty hazy yellow orange. Nice small head. Looks on point for the style.
S: Wow, the smell of this is truly special. Tropical fruits, grapefruit, mango swirling together in a blissful mixture. This beer has the "wow" factor as far as the scent. One of the best smelling ales I've ever had.
T: While the beer is very tasty, dare I say , after the scent, the taste was SLIGHTLY disappointing. This is not to say that the beer isn't very good, which it clearly is. This beer has complexity going for it, the swirl of flavors is intriguing. This is definitely a pale ale and not an IPA as people hint. It is the hoppiest pale ale I have ever had, but the bone dry finish and bready malty biscuit flavors lend itself to the PA rather than IPA category. This is not an oily beer. As tasty is this is, the low APV leaves the brew a tad bit thin for my personal preference, although this is a personal comment. For the style, I should probably give this a 4.5, but I am going to give it a 4 because I didn't flip out over it. 
M: Impressively medium bodied for a beer clocking in at 5.4%. Rare is a palette wrecker at under 6% APV, but here you have it! This beer really is bitter as hell and is intense as it could possibly be.
O: Overall, sometimes a sublime work of art is not "enjoyable" but is disturbing. I am being poetic here, but I did not love the experience of drinking this beer, yet I know it was something unusual and special. The bone dry bitterness of this would keep me from actively seeking it out so I'll give it a 4, but this is a really memorable and intense beer. this pushes the limit of a Pale Ale, and is fresh and vibrant tasting. The smell is truly exceptional. This is my first Hill Farmstead tasting and I look forward to trying some of their higher APV offerings. 1,830 charactersAvantyawn, Jul 26, 2011

The growlers are just as pretty. The beer pours hazy honey/amber in color. The head is big and bubbly and leaves a bunch of lacing.
S-Hoppier smelling than most IPAs. Fresh resinous hops. Hops are juicy, tropical, and also piney and herbal. It does have a great balance with some pretty delectable smelling malts as well. Quite bready.
T-I cannot understand how anything can be so flavorful. The hops are so fresh. Tropical fruits and citrus collide with pine needles. The malt takes a bit of a back seat to the hop bouquet but it adds depth and balance and is delicious in its own regard. Juicy, juicy, juicy. Delicious.
M-Lighter bodied with some beautiful carbonation. Bubbles prickle and tickle. Dry bitter aftertaste. Great feel, this is where you can tell that this is a American Pale Ale.
O/D-This and Abner were so delicious. Hill Farmstead has such a cool this going on at their farm. I could drink this and be happy for my whole life. Such a bold, stylish APA. Vermont is killing it. 1,091 charactersVelvetExtract, Jul 24, 2011
4.92/5  rDev +12.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5While it's not an IPA, Edward is the beer that last fall renewed by interest in hoppy IPAs and pale ales after moving away from them a bit over the previous year. It's a phenomenal beer brewed in a unique and earnest setting, and one of my favorite beers I've ever had the pleasure of drinking.
A: Pours a beautiful, reddish-copper amber with a haziness that glows beautifully when held to the sun. The head is quick and bubbly white, but leaves a nice bit of sticky lacing.
S: O! the Joy! The smell is exquisite and exceptionally fresh, with crisp, clean floral notes and a hint of cut grass. There's not much pine or citrus in here, but a bit, as well as a hint of bready malts. The floral, grassy hop notes are what dominant though, and their dominance is benevolent.
T: The taste follows the nose with the hops dominating, balanced as they are by the malts which don't do much talking of their own. The taste is floral and grassy as is the nose, with again a bit of pine, but very little in the way of citrus or herbal. It's incredibly clean with a wonderful bitter bite that never overwhelms.
M: Medium-bodied, fuller than expected but not in a bad way. The malts, which seem to stand well behind the hops in the nose and taste are evident here propping up the body. Carbonation is spot on and the feeling is dry without being dehydrating.
D: Supreme. The reasonably low ABV, exceptional body, aesthetic beauty, and superb taste and smell make this one of the best, most drinkable beers I've ever had. I imagine it owes some of its greatness to its freshness, but either way this is an excellent beer. It's wonderfully hoppy, bitter and flavorful without having some of the dehydrating characteristics of some IPAs and APAs, and would make a great all-night beer. At the anniversary party and in the three growler fills I've had, Edward is the beer I keep coming back to at Hill Farmstead. I dream of one day having a bierkeller with old shelves stocked full of beer around an old oak table and a keg of Edward at hand. 2,029 charactersFrankLloydMike, Jul 22, 2011
4.39/5  rDev 0%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Drank from a 750 ml swing top growler purchased at the Hill Farmstead Brewery, Greensboro, VT
Served in a Hill Farmstead Brewery stemmed glass
The beer poured a super hazy, peachy-amber color with a small, bubbly, bright white head that quickly dissolved. Spotty drips of lacing stuck along the glass.
Super sweet and fragrant tropical fruit notes came through strong in the nose. Lots of mango and pineapple. Strong orange and clove notes as well. Somewhat floral and slightly grassy. Overall, remarkably interesting and complex.
The flavor profile was also quite hoppy, yet not as dynamic as the nose. Crisp, citrusy and slightly bitter. A sturdy, pale malt backbone kept the hops in check. Lots of grapefruit pith and orange rind. Super dry, piney and resiny on the finish. Bitter, yet not overly so.
The mouthfeel was medium bodied. Slick and smooth on the palate with a fine, moderate effervescence.
This is a pale ale? Really? The quantity of hops in this brew, and the overall complexity, would have me believe that this is an IPA (or even perhaps a double IPA). Impressive, to say the least. 1,104 charactersDamian, Jul 20, 2011
4.97/5  rDev +13.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I've had the pleasure of having Hill Farmstead's Edward Pale Ale several times on tap, most recently on a trip to Waterbury, where I drank it at the Reservoir with a buddy of mine and my girlfriend. We discussed superpowers. "What if you could speak any language in the world, but 50% of the time you said anything you sh*t yourself?" Ooh la la. I suppose it would Depends.
Edward pours a malty pale golden amber puffy white headed goodness. It smells almost like an IPA, but the malt backbone comes through in the nose too, and that tells you it's more of a pale. Bready biscuits, malt, caramel, and pine and sharp grapefruit hops come through in both the smell of it and the taste of it. It starts sweet, then sweeps through with hops at the end that finish clean. No trace of the 5.2% alcohol, not at all drying, and the carbonation and medium-body drink so sweetly that I want another as soon as I finish the pint. Hands down one of the best pale ales I've had.
And despite that conversation, I will use my words to order this any future time it's on tap. In English. It's a beautiful beer. But perhaps not worth dirty trousers. 1,134 charactersafksports, Jul 16, 2011

A: Amber, of the variety you'd expect to see a perfectly preserved ancient mosquito full of ancient DNA extracted from terrestrial mammals. Minimal seafoam head quickly went extinct.
S: Touch of musty fruit with a moderate smell of fresh pine resin.
T: Same as nose. Light fruitiness is smothered and encased by the strong, piny hops. Faintly bitter finish.
M: Light and smooth. Carbonation on the tongue is like troupe of tap-dancing mosquitos.
O: We're all food that hasn't died. Except for Edward, who has been encased in amber and poured out into our cups. 
Pales aren't usually my thing. The hops are heavier than I'd expected. I'm sure Edward is very nice but I wouldn't want to hang around with him for more than a pint. We're different people. 820 charactersDirtyPenny, Jul 10, 2011

Holy crap a HF growler of Edward, thanks Central PA group
In my opinion as APAs go they are either good or mediocre, there is no inbetween. This is good, damn good. This pours as most pale ales would a golden body with a white foam topper. The aroma is of many many hop varietals that I dare not have my nose try and decipher them all. All I can say is citrus and flowers work so well together whilst smelling this beer. The flavor is quite tasty as well. It's good for it's style and the malt body accents the perfectly added hops. The mouthfeel is smooth and delicious. Overall this is a good beer and more people should have the grand opportunity to be graced with what is clearly one of the top 5 of it's style. 740 charactersVdubb86, Jul 02, 2011

S: waves of aromatic hops on the front, lots of tropical fruit with features of Mangos, Tangerine, and grapefruit. Slight malty character noticeable in background. 
T: awesome balance, hops aren't as fruity on the palate, but they provide a nice amount of bitterness to balance nicely with slightly bready malts.
MF: light body, medium to high carbonation

Big thanks to the Central PA crew from the Gang Bang BIF for this growler!
And the Gang Bang enjoyment begins here. It pours a cloudy amber-straw topped by a couple fingers of cream-white foam. The nose comprises grapefruit, lemon zest, mango, papaya, light pine, light caramel, and light vanilla. The taste holds notes of grapefruit peel, orange peel, pine, lemon peel, dark greens, grass, and flowers. The body is a rather light medium, with a very light moderate carbonation and a dry, kinda sticky finish. Overall, a very good APA, one where a seeming lack of balance does not hurt it all too much at all. Damn, I wish I could get more of this whenever I wanted to... 718 charactersTMoney2591, Jun 26, 2011

Pours a hazy dark golden orange color with golden tangerine hues and a one finger frothy white head that quickly settles into a lasting ring.  Streaky lacing left behind. 
Sweet citrus hop aroma with hits of dry earthy pine.  Oily and resinous notes countered by hints of orange peel, mango, grapefruit and tangerine.  Pale grainy biscuit malt with hints of graham cracker.  
Lighter end of medium bodied with a blast of dry bitter hops that linger over the sweet tropical and citrus fruit notes and pale malt backbone info a spicy dry finish.  Very good balance of bitter, dry and sweet notes.  Hints of oily pine, mango, pineapple and straw with biscuit and Graham cracker malt notes.  A bit watered down but still plenty hoppy without being one dimensional.  Very easy to drink. 814 characterscorby112, Jun 25, 2011
4.59/5  rDev +4.6%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 32-oz swing top growler.
The color is a hazed amber straw, which is topped by about 2 fingers' depth of head. The head fades quickly leaving slight ghostly lacing on the sides of the glass.
The aroma is without a doubt on of the best I have ever experienced in a pale ale. So much going on, and yet, so crisp. There is no muddled feeling, even with the various hop notes that I am pulling out of it. Floral and citrusy hops (grapefruit and lemon zest) contrast nicely against the background of a hint of sweet caramel malt. A touch of piney hop aroma in there for some emphasis, and a good dose of bitterness, to boot.
The flavor is phenomenal. Bitter enough that I thought it was an IPA. I was shocked to hear that it was not. However, the levity of the palate certainly does track more closely to a pale ale. The hop characteristics from the aroma are again all present in the flavor, with the floral notes overwhelming the citrus a bit. As much as I like floral, I felt that the citrus was a starring component in the nose, and I was sad to lose it.
I have to say that this is one of the best Pale Ales that I have ever had the pleasure of drinking. This stuff comes highly recommended. 1,207 charactersNittanyBeerFan, Jun 24, 2011
4.72/5  rDev +7.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Poured from fresh 64 oz growler filled at the brewery.
Appearance: Two-handed growler pour into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass. Commercial pour! A hearty 1 finger fluffy dark white head that fades fairly quick. Golden orange color - pretty beer. Faint lacing. 
Smell: Citrus and grapefruit dominate, bit o' pine, bit o' hops. Exactly how it's supposed to smell.
Taste: Heavenly. A juicy citrus flavor quite unlike any Pale I've tried. The bitter hop kick says IPA, but the low alcohol and refreshing taste say Pale. Bitter and pine flavor balance out the citrus. Definitely dry.
Mouthfeel: Medium body and medium carb. Smooth and enjoyable.
Drinkability: Off the charts high. At a hair over 5% it's "sessionable", but bows to nobody in flavor. I could easily drink this all night long, and probably will until the growler is gone.
Overall: A revelation. I don't know what's going on in Northern New England, but between this guy and Maine Beer's Peeper, the landscape of the American Pale Ale is being changed. I'm not sure there's a better APA than Edward out there today. 1,079 characterscbeer88, Jun 24, 2011

Nose jumps out pretty well with all sort of citrus, bitter grapefruit with a little dankness and some biscuity character. Taste opens up immediately with hops, grapefruit at first, but I also get some mango and orange coming through too. Malt is almost not even present save for the faintest bit of bread hidden beneath all the hops. A touch heftier than light bodied with a little under medium carbonation levels. I fill up a growler with this regularly if I could. 542 charactersbadbeer, Jun 20, 2011

The nose is primarily orange citrus aromas with some dank grassy hops in the aroma. The taste is a little more tropical. Oranges and grapefruit with some dank grassy hops in the background giving a nice bitter finish. 
Nice light body on the feel with good soft carbonation. Overall a well made pale ale. Easy to drink with enjoyable flavors. 505 charactersBendurgin, Jun 19, 2011

Sadness envelopes us all. THis is for the shorties..
Clear and pale, like an ale. Clean and hoppy deliciousness with tangerine sexy, I suppose this is the product of their style of hop additions. Leave no wort behind! A little bit of malt character but not much body overall, leaving behind a clean and hoppy beer. Pretty tasty, glad to share it with some good folks. 625 charactersdragonWhale, Jun 16, 2011

Pours a hazy orange color with a little half inch of head. Minimal lacing down the glass.
Smells like pine, citrus, earth and bread.
Taste opens up with a serious pine presence and moved into a bread flavor. Finishes with pine and a bit of a lingering taste of pine.
Mouthfeel is a bit heavy but great carbonation.

Thanks, Barry (bring)! Growler opened with Javier and poured into a Hill Farmstead glass.
A: Hazy orange with a frothy white head. The head lingers for a minute and leaves scattered white lacing all over the glass.
S: Resinous pine with notes of orange and grapefruit flesh. The hop profile is bright and expressive, opening up more and more with every second of warming. Light passion fruit notes. The fruit is mostly flesh, with just a dash of rind. Killer aroma. No alcohol and no real malt presence.
T: Moderate bitterness with lots of orange, tangerine, and grapefruit. Pine resin melds with a light crackery malt profile. No evident alcohol or harsh notes. A massive amount of hop flavor. It's like a hop juice. 
M: Upper light to lower medium in body with moderate carbonation. Light, dry, crisp, and sticky mouthfeel.
Overall: An excellent hoppy pale. I could drink this all night. 904 charactersHopHead84, Jun 09, 2011

Pours a filmy golden orange color with some bright hues. A thick, frothy white head rests on top of the glass and retains throughout the pour, leaving tons of lacing. 
Explosive hoppiness balanced with some doughy malts and biscuit tones. Decent amount of citrus and grapefruit, light sweetness and spice. 
Bold hop punch up front with bitter citrus and grapefruit. Not overly hoppy, but aggressive enough to wake the senses. Decent malt backbone on the bready and biscuit side, some notes of caramel sweetness. Finishes hoppy, bitter, and dry. 
Medium body and carbonation, dry and lingering on the tongue. Crazy drinkability on this and solid flavor - I could easily plow through a growler with a friend during the summer months. 766 charactersxnicknj, Jun 08, 2011

A: Standard pour yields a .5 finger coarse white head with low retention. Beer is a cloudy orange-grapefruit. Stringy and frothy lace with moerate stick. Good legs. Average. 
S: Nose is pine, astringent citrus, dank hops, and some caramel and cane sugar. Very aromatic with good balance. Nice. 
T: Opens citrus, pine, and bark bitterness. Filmy. Grassy mellow hops towards the middle. Mango, papaya and cane sugar round out the flavors. Finish is bitter pine with the same aftertaste. IPA-like almost. 
M: Light to medium bodied with low carbonation. Smooth and mellow in the mouth and soft going down. Quiet and subtle finish with an oily aftertaste. Again, pretty standard. 
O: Very drinkable and quite quenching, Edward is definitely a beer that you get by the growler-full. I could drink this one all day on a hot summer afternoon. 990 charactersSpeedwayJim, Jun 05, 2011
4.3/5  rDev -2.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5On tap at Capone's today...
The beer pours a slightly hazy orange color with good head retention and lacing. Pretty hard to tell the difference between this and the abner/double citra, except this beer is even drier with an obviouly lower abv. As a result, this beer is almost light tastting, but with a long, hoppy, bitter finish. The sweet malt is barely noticeable in this beer, and is at most a foil for the impressive hoppy bitterness in this beer. Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied, with a long, bitter finish.
This is just an amazingly good pale ale.... for a hop head. Just lovely... 595 charactersJohn_M, Jun 03, 2011

-great hop taste and great hop bitterness. yet not overboard at all for the style. the hops are orange tasting with a bit of grassiness involved. citra? this is all balanced out very well by a malty sweetness

Had during Hobo Tasting #5 while sitting inside RJ Rockers! Served from growler into a Stone nonic. Poured a murky yellow-orange with a one finger bone white head that subsided to a very minimal amount quickly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, citrus, and citrus hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, citrus, and citrus hop. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was an excellent brew. The citrus aspect on this one kept me coming back for more. I really like citrus in my beer (no, not like the citrus people like in their Blue Moons) so this one was a no-brainer for me. Really glad I got to try this one. Just hate Mike left me with a half a growler of this at Rockers when he left. I blame this growler for getting me drunk that night by the way...

Smell: A mild citrus at first, orange I think, but as it sat in front of me, I began to get more pine.
Taste: Very refreshing, balanced, but definitely tipping towards the bitter side. Some lasting bitterness and pine towards the end. Didn't really get much citrus in the taste.
Mouthfeel: Incredible, carbonation was a little higher than I thought it would be (not a bad thing), and it seemed a perfect balance of substance and not being too heavy of a beer (it is a pale ale after all)
Overall: Wonderful pale ale. I walked 3 miles in Brooklyn just to taste this beer and it was well worth the journey. Exact type of beer I'd like to spend all day drinking in the summer. 819 charactersbpalfrey10, Mar 27, 2011

4.5 A: Hazed orangish brown color. Two fingers of off-white creamy/frothy hybrid head. Retention is very good and the lacing is leaving no glass exposed. Can't get much better than this.
4.5 S: Hops are quite floral and citrusy, with some grassiness in there as well. Grapefruit, pine, and some mandarin orange. What is really amazing is how well the yeast is controlled. For an unfiltered pale ale, this is magnificently clean. Just a small touch of bready yeastiness. 
4.0 T: The taste is much like the nose: clean and hoppy with excellent yeastmanship. Grapefruit and pine are a bit stronger than in the nose and work with a moderate hop bitterness to please the hophead's palate. Hops can be described as resiny. Touch of neutral sweetness from the malt to balance the bitterness and a smaller touch of bready yeast.
4.0 M: Medium body. Good moderate carbonation, very good for a growler. Reasonably creamy and super smooth.
4.0 D: I have doubts that labeling this a APA is appropriate, but I don't doubt that this is a great beer. Very drinkable as I got through half a growler very quickly. The hop flavor is good, but the impressive aspect is how clean the yeast is. Not the most complex of brews, but worth a drink. 1,398 charactersDavoleBomb, Mar 26, 2011

A: I don't think a pale ale could look any better. Cloudy pale orange color. The pour dropped a huge 3 finger head that left tons of sticky lace.
A: The freshest hop nose imaginable. Big grapefruit, tangerine, and grass. The small malt profile shines through but the hops is what this one's all about.
T: again big citrus. Orange, grapefruit, and tangerine, flowed my a nice sweet malt backbone. The brew finishes very dry, and tangy. Just about perfect for an apa.
M: Medium body, good amount of carbonation. Again just about perfect for the style.

Beer is yellow / slightly darker yellow and mostly clear. Forms a decent white head of small and medium bubbles, moderate carbonation, and some lacing on the glass. So far so good.
Aroma of the beer is like grapefruit and other citrus / fruit varieties, you can also cut through the hops and get to the mild malt presence in the aroma.
Beer is medium in body and quite hoppy but without being too bitter. I kept thinking to myself what a great base beer this would be for just about anything you wanted to do. It is a solid APA and one of the best I've ever had. I thoroughly enjoyed it. 631 charactersdrabmuh, Mar 22, 2011

The beer appears mostly clear and orange in color. For some reason, my pour was more transparent than others. Interesting. 
The aroma brings an array of pleasant hop and citrus notes.
The beer is very flavorful and enjoyable. Light on the palate, and effortless to drink, this is only one of two growlers that enticed me enough to go back for seconds that evening. Well balanced and delicious. By well balanced, the hops play the lead role, but the various citrus and hop flavors meld together harmoniously.
The feel is a bit on the thin side, but at 5.2% and packed with flavor, I'm OK with that.
I definitely recommend this beer. It would be quite easy to throw back a few pints of Edward. 740 charactersHuhzubendah, Mar 12, 2011

the best pour a pale ale could have hands down. bow down to it. a deep amber that was soo cloudy and hazy you could not see through to the other side of the bottle no matter what you tried. amazing looking beer with a huge which head that stuck to anything it came close to. 
the aroma was to die for as the hops were soo fresh, soo clean it made you cry. such a deep resonant citrus aroma coming off of this, i hardly could speak.rich orange, pineapple, tangerine, juicy it was soo fresh, no bitterness or harshness, soo full and fresh like you were sucking on a whole cone, again just amazing here. clean finish with a dry, juciy finish that left you searching, begging to find more.

a - Pours a murky yellow golden color with one inch of white head and light carbonation evident.
s - Smells of citrus hops, fruity malts, grapefruit, pine hops, and bready, pale malts. I wasn't expecting this to be as hoppy as it was, and was pleasantly surprised.
t - Taste follows the nose; lots of citrus hops, and fruity malts, followed by some smooth bready malts. Also some light pine hops and tropical fruits. Very enjoyable.
m - Medium body and moderate carbonation. had a nice smooth body.
d - Overall I thought this was a great APA; one of the best ones I've had along with Alpha King. Lots of hops in the nose and taste, and at 5.2% ABV it's insanely drinkable; I felt like I wouldn't have a problem finishing a growler by myself. Would love to have this one again. 861 charactersmdfb79, Mar 08, 2011
4.66/5  rDev +6.2%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Cloudy orange color with a light head and lacing. I am not sure the ride home over extremely frost-heaved roads, that may have loosened the cap a bit, did much to help the clarity or head.
The aroma on the other hand is outstanding. Hops city! Citrus, pine, and floral notes abound and are quite strong. The flavor is also very hop forward - round and citrusy in the middle with a long pleasantly bitter piney finish. 
Medium bodied, smooth and juicy. This is a beer that is thirst quenching and refreshing - sessionable and quaffable at the same time that it is worthy of sipping slowly and contemplating. And with more hop aroma and flavor than many IPA's and some double IPA's, at only 5% alchohol - I'd say that is the definition of perfect drinkability. 760 charactersCliffBrake, Mar 05, 2011
5/5  rDev +13.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Served in a goblet at Canal St.
Pours a radiant, chilled peachy apricot color with a thick cream colored head. Excellent retention, the head never quite fades away and leaves behind thick, sticky rings of lace.
Aroma is fresh and abundantly hoppy. Bitter grapefruit rind and pine with subtle tropical fruit sweetness. 
Body is medium thick and chewy with in your face carbonation. Flavor is ridiculously hoppy and rich for a 5% APA. Like the nose, grapefruit and pine hops, resiny and bitter, dominate from start to finish. There is a slight bready malt present and some sweet tropical fruits as the beer warms, but the hops are what linger well into the finish. Incredible flavor and hop presence for what is expected to be a mild APA.
Edit 01/13/13: Changing this score to my first perfect 5's because this is... perfect 826 charactersyourefragile, Mar 05, 2011

4.12/5  rDev -6.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Served on-tap at Al's of Hampden into a nonic pint.
A - Pours sunkist orange with a nice thick one finger tall white head, dissipating down to a light film, leaving spotty lacing down the glass.
S - Lots of strong, grassy, citric hops blend in well with the bready malt to form a nicely balanced nose. While the hops dominate they really never get too out of control. Good stuff.
T - Nice grassy hop bite up front giving way to a mix of graham cracker malt and grapefruit flavors from the citric hops. Finish is a bit chewy with plenty of lingering bitterness. Having had quite a few of the hoppy Hill Farmstead offerings now I would have to say this one is near the top of the list. Glad I finally got to try it.
M - Medium body and flavor with moderate carbonation. A mix of pine resin and chewy malt in both the feel and finish.
D - Pretty good. I really enjoyed this one quite a bit. The strong hop punch was very nice, as was the lower ABV, but the chewy feel brought it down a notch. Still very drinkable tho. 1,020 charactersorangesol, Mar 01, 2011

A: This one is much like all other hoppy Hill Farmstead beers: a murky orange color with a white head.
S: A very nice citrus aroma to this one. Plenty of grapefruit and tangerine with a mild tropical fruit character to it. Mild bread notes to go with it and perhaps some grass. Nice and fruity without being overly sweet.
T: Lots of tangerine, grapefruit, and pineapple flavor to this beer. A mild bitterness with some clean bread and cracker malt flavor. The amount of tropical fruit flavor really kind of creeps up on you as you continue to drink the beer.
M: The body is medium with a moderate carbonation.
O: Tried this again and the descriptors are similar but the beer is far better. 726 characterswomencantsail, Feb 21, 2011
4.04/5  rDev -8%look: 3 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Pours a murky golden color with some orange hues. No head to speak of, looks quite flat.
The aroma is quite nice. Fresh grapefruit hops dominate the aroma. Some light pine and pepper as well. A bit of musty aromas from the yeast. Definitely has a "home-brew" aroma to it.
Again, nice fresh grapefruit hop flavor. The hop profile ranks right up there with SNPA for the style. There is a yeast presence that dirty ups the flavor but its fairly light and gives the beer a rustic tone. Solid malt flavor, bready enough to support the hops but doesn't really add any flavor.
Moderate feel with soft to tingly carbonation. Sweet and bitter on the palate.
Great hop profile on this APA, very tasty. It does have a home brew character to it but its damn delious. 758 charactersGmann, Feb 20, 2011

Pours a very hazy light apricot color with a good white head and a pretty good amount of lacing as it goes down the glass. The nose simply explodes with hoppy notes ranging from tropical to citrus with a bit of floral and pine in there for good measure. Simply a cornucopia of all that hops can do to a beer. The taste drives this up to the next level--simply awe-inspiring. Wow, so good. There really isn't any hint at all of malt, other than that it adds a bit of a base so the beer's not too thin. It is quite dry, however. Dry finish with a very resiny, bitter finish. So much flavor in a 5.2% pale ale. I simply love this. One of the best beers I've had in a long, long, long time. 856 charactersThorpe429, Feb 16, 2011

Poured into a Lost Abbey tumbler, a pale orange with a small off white bubbly head that sits at the edge of the glass. Grassy hop aroma with a straw like malt, very subtle and clean. Taste is hoppy and bitter, very grassy, some grapefruit, malty bread crust, some biscuit malts, not too sweet. Medium/light bodied with a light carbonation, kind of watery. A very solid APA, this one is very drinkable. 469 charactersnkersten, Feb 11, 2011
4.05/5  rDev -7.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to tenderbranson for sharing this 1 liter growler filled at Al's of Hampden. Enjoyed multiple times from a 1/2 pint. 
 An appearance that is very creamy looking -almost like a creamsicle with orange tinged and very resinous look with carbonation still visible, with fast rising bubbles The head is thick rocky and white with small beading and lots of lace stickage. The aroma is dank with herbal qualities and very earthy nose somewhat like fresh mown hay with a slight floral element. The mild grassy nose is only tinged slightly with a citrus odor. The feel is highly bitter, but not sharp, just on the aggressive side with slight resinous quality which is midly oily and drying. The malt is there w/ medium body and a semi-dry texture leaves the balance in the hop side but slightly thin w/ mild citrus tone and gentle alcohol quality. 
 The taste has a lot of vegetal hoppiness-grassy at times with mild taste of green herbal acidic hops which gives the impression of some tea-like astringency. The hops have a spiciness w/ slight peppery heat and there is mild sweetness from the malt w/ a faint citrus element as it finishes. I think this is a great beer, but it straddles the line between IPA and American Pale: it has the hoppiness of an IPA but lacks the malt and alcohol so it comes off as more bitter and yet still is highly drinkable for the style. I think this is an excellent beer, but hard to rate it higher since it is flavorful but seems slightly out of place in the traditional American pale category. 1,528 charactersSlatetank, Feb 07, 2011

A - Burnt orange color with a white head that had some good lacing. 
S - Bready malt, citrus hops, bittering resin. This is a great smelling hoppy APA, one of my favorite regular drinking styles.
T - Citrus which is slightly grapefruit, and some mild pine and floral notes. Resin is nice and bittering there on the end, and the malt backbone supports the hops well. If you gave this to my blind I would believe you if you said it was Daisy Cutter, albeit a slightly less flavorful version. Good stuff.
M - Just a touch watery, lighter side of medium bodied, healthy dose of carbonation.
D - Really good brew, this would be a perfect post-workout beer for me. good stuff i would drink regularly if I have the chance. 775 charactersAgentZero, Feb 07, 2011

A - There's a finger-plus of soapy white foam that settles to a thin cap, leaving behind solid lacing. The body is a hazed peach-golden color with some transparency.
S - It's a hoppy pale ale! Pine and citrus zest, pale bready malt, and a bit of herbal aromatics as well.
T - Nice zesty grapefruit, some pine and floral notes. Medium residual bitterness that doesn't get out of hand. Thankfully doesn't have the yeasty character some other low-gravity hoppy beers have. Solid balance between hops and malt.
M - This is the weak point of this beer in my opinion, although perhaps it's better on-tap. Somewhat watery medium-light body, medium carbonation, smooth texture. Fairly refreshing, but could use a bit more heft to it.
D - Crushable! It's a very good hoppy pale ale. I don't like it quite as much as Daisy Cutter (or Parking Violation), but there'd be no shame in having this as your local pale. Would (will?) have again when I go to Vermont. 1,023 charactersMasterSki, Feb 06, 2011

This pours a murky medium peach with some orange notes, wish it was filtered but I like the color. The head is a bright white, good retention and lacing... The aroma is very hoppy with lots of citrus notes. Oranges, flowers, dry hopped pine, and a bit of citra hops. Pretty good... The taste is more oranges than anything, orange peel, orange juice, a little pine, with a floral finish. Tastes like a dry hopped lighter Daisy Cutter. Not bad, a little simple but a crushable pale.

a - Pale orange and a bit cloudy. Very little head or lace and the bar tender had to work hard to get any on it.
s - This beer smells pretty good. Resiny, tropical goodness. No alcohol, malt, or really anything else. Just hops. 
t - Really just hops. Hardly any malt. Very one-dimensional. More citrus than the smell leads on. Maybe a hint of sweet, or is that just wateriness. Not bad if you like all hops. Something a little off though. Maybe burnt rubber or bandaid. 
m - Low carbonation and very thin. Not sure if it is just really dry but there is really no body to this beer. 
d - I guess if you are a di-hard hophead it might be drinkable but even then I think there is something unpleasent about it. Watery hop juice really. 
People seem to love this beer and I've heard great things about Hill Farmstead. I look forward to trying some other Hill beers but this one really just didn't live up to the hype. What am I missing? 965 charactersCascade77, Jan 26, 2011

A - Murky pinkish orange with a finger of frothy white head and eventually light lacing. This looks like dark pink lemonade. 
S - Huge lemon, grass, pine and floral hop action going on. 
T - Buttery nut and cracker or white bread malt right away. This hop profile is beefy and complex; lots of lemon, mango and tangerine citrus which adds a little bitter and a little sweet. Unbelievable balance. 
M - Medium body, medium to high carbonation.
D - Drinks very quickly because of the fantastic malt and hop balance in the flavor which ends in a fair amount of bitter. This is a ballsy pale ale, could easily be construed as an ipa thanks to the huge range of tasty hops. 735 charactersdrewba, Jan 23, 2011

A: Lightly hazy pale orange body with a thin but sticky off-white head. Light lace. Just fine.
S: Fruity hops burst forth with huge mango, guava, and grapefruit. Nothing but hops here. Awesome.
T: Fruity hops start things off, followed by some cattiness, some chalkiness, and a super bitter finish. Very clean and dry, but not entirely pleasant flavor-wise.
M: Lively medium body. Great.
D: Good not great. 
Notes: I love a pale ale that just bombards you with hops, and Edward does just that. It can't be denied, though, that the results of this hops attack aren't entirely pleasant. I'm guessing some young Citra or Simcoe vines contributed both to the luscious flavors and the astringent cattiness - let's hope that soon these delicious hops will reach maturity and leave the roughness behind.
Cheers! 860 characterswoosterbill, Jan 09, 2011

A: Pours a clean pumpkin orange with a brief white head.

D: Pretty extreme. I could drink this all night. Not really any less aggressive than a lot of the DIPA's I've had.

S: Wow. This is the hoppiest pale ale I have ever smelled. Huge citrus notes. Resiny and piney as well. They dry hopped the hell out of this thing and it does not come across as vegitle at all.
T:The taste is not nearly as intense as the nose. Tons of citrus hops. Nice bitterness that can be a little harsh at times. Little bit of lemongrass. They managed to get every taste that hops can impart in a beer with an ABV of 5.20. I am impressed.
M: It feels thin but it is to style. It is just this tastes like a DIPA so my mind expects the body to be a little thicker. Carbonation is nice.

The taste is extremely bitter with a strong lingering bitterness which last throughout. You really cannot detect any malt worth speaking of; maybe some light pale and crystal malts, but are those really malt flavors. The citrus hops resonate throughout the palate and are unrelenting.
Mouthfeel is smooth with ample carbonation.
Very drinkable and definitely a good session beer. I couldn't drink more than one or two though (my personal preference), because it kinda kills your palate/tongue from the abundance of hop bitterness. A real tasty offering to have just one pint of though. Crisp and refreshing with light bitterness. One of the best APAs I have have in recent memory. 768 charactersclaspada, Dec 11, 2010

I'm surprised this is listed as a pale ale, because everything about this beer made it seem like a high-quality, unique American IPA. The floral nose is exceptional, with a two-finger head and lacing that lingers for quite some time. Taste is delicious and sesionable - good hoppy bite up front, though not as hop-forward as a West Coast IPA, but very smooth with a mild creamy aftertaste, likely aided by the residual lacing. I highly recommend this beer. I am very excited to try some more offerings from Hill Farmstead. 589 charactersElGallo, Nov 05, 2010

A: Served with two fingers of foamy white head with average (maybe slightly below) retention. Lace sticks fantastically. The body is orange amber with a hazy 70% opacity. Very good looking in the glass. 
S & T: Top notch aroma, especially for an APA. Heavy mango pulp aromas. Grapefruit and mandarin orange back it up. Sweet and juicy hop bill. The nose and flavor are perfect and may be the closest an APA has ever come to an IPA. Minimal malts. Truly a work of art.
M: If there are ANY complaints to be made (and there aren't really), it's in the mouthfeel department. Not that Edward *really* needs it, but a heftier malt bill would have saved the mouthfeel from mediocrity. This brew is on the light and thin side and has semi-short flavor duration. Carbonation, however, is more than adequate, lively and fizzy. 
D: This brew drinks phenomenally well and is easily better than most IPAs. How often do you come across a Pale Ale that is served in anything-less-than-a-pint-glass, all while commanding the price of a premier DIPA? And deserve it? Huh?

Appears a hazy orangish amber color. Large cream colored head falls to a big lump floater. Big lacing. The smell is of grapefruit, sweet malt a nice balance. It smells super fresh. The taste was of delicate floral hops with a nice sweet malt backbone. Fruity in the middle and finishes floral and slightly dry. Mild carbonation and very smooth. the body is on the heavy side of light.

4.35/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5This particular glass came from a growler but I've had this beer several times previous.
Pours a clear orange-amber color with a thick, frothy white head that builds to 3 fingers and slowly recedes into a persistent creamy crop throughout the drink. Sticky, high lacing tangles down the edges.
Aroma is entirely hop forward, with strong notes of tropical fruit and piney, gooey goodness. Grapefruit, tangerine, mango apricot, pineapple and pine cones. Only light residual sweetness with very little malt qualities come through. Wonderful and intoxicating.
Taste is fruity, bold but clean. Starts with tropical fruit notes and moves to light citrusy bite with pney after notes. Nice resinous flavors blend the malt backbone with full, round hop notes that dominate the mouth. 
Mouthfeel is nice. Clean, light-to-medium bodied with some stickiness around the mouth the peels away in the final swallow. 
This beer is so hard NOT to drink...it has that inescapable "more-ishness" that the English apparently say. My staple beer from now on...whenever I can get it. 1,065 charactersNoLiberty, Oct 10, 2010
4.5/5  rDev +2.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5On tap @ the Three Penny Taproom (Montpelier, VT) on 9/25/10. Served in a pint glass. 
Pours a clear copper, with a ½ finger of bright-white head. This retains with some richness around the edges and some thinner wisps in the center, leaving a rather heavy looking sticky cascade of lacing back. The aroma is bright in the nostrils with full citrus flavors of grapefruit, sharp rind, and a dash of lemon zest. Some sweeter tropical character mixes in as well but this feel mostly bitter overall. Malts add an almost sugary and doughy sweetness to the back of the nostrils and really help take the balance of this here in the nose to a new level. 
The taste is just fantastic, with full-on bitter grapefruit and citrus peel giving this a sharp yet still flavorful bitterness, while that mix of tropical notes (which are more pronounced here) and the sugary and bready sweetness (but not overly so) of the malts giving this a tremendous feeling balance. This finishes with pine and spice that adhere to the tongue with a dry resinous stickiness. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, with a crisp creaminess that is equal parts sharpness and an oily slickness that really keeps this moving across the palate despite just a touch of alcohol beef on the back of the swallow. 
A full flavored hop profile, great balance (the sugary feel of the malts really makes this work) and a smooth drinking body really set this apart big time from your everyday Pale Ale. I REALLY enjoyed this and I'd have to say that this was probably a top three APA for me. This would be a hoppy go-to for sure if I was local to it. Another great offering here from this new brewery. 1,652 charactersKegatron, Sep 28, 2010

Edward is a darker shade than a normal pale ale, not to say that he is not normal but the color resembles a light shade of brown with amber while a mass of white foam is up top, kinda sticky lace. Smell is hop laden with citrus, grapefruit and a touch of pine. Small malts sweetness as well. Taste is good, I had two pints and I hardly repeat myself. Semi citrus grapefruit and pine with a small sweet candi like maltiness. Feel is bold, somewhat bitter and nicely carbed. This is easy drinking here with low alcohol and enough ummmphh to make you come back for more. 592 charactersBARFLYB, Sep 26, 2010

4.32/5  rDev -1.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5On-tap at the Farmhouse in Emmaus, PA, served in a standard red wine glass. This is a heck of a pale ale. My only knock is that the hops are so rich, there's no hint of the barley. Still, the hops are fantastic. The aroma is filled with piney, sharp grapefruit and a hint of horse blanket. The flavor is similar with a mix of citrus and pine that feels light and drinkable, but is unusually flavorful. There's also hint of cracked black pepper and the a mild funk that reminds me of young Orval.
I don't know if I've ever had a pale ale quite like this in more than 2,000 reviews - and it's damn good. Find this beer. 618 characterstempest, Aug 27, 2010
4.5/5  rDev +2.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I had this on draft a few times while in Burlington on vacation.
A: A dark golden color. 
S: Citrus and pine. A perfect hop balance in the smell.
T: The taste delivered on the smell. So well balanced with the perfect hops to malts.
M: Nicely carbonated. The pine resin lingers which makes the next sip more intense and enjoyable.
D: Probably one of the best american pale ales I have ever consumed.
This beer is about as perfect as they get. Seek it out. 456 charactersmymrnngjckt, Aug 23, 2010

4.69/5  rDev +6.8%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Yeah the guys at the brewery told me to drink this growler no later than 3 days after the filling but I saved it 5 days for lap and papaya salad at Winooski's Tiny Thai. Very good idea.
A- Copper with golden accents. Glad to see some head, It stays until you take a sip. You'll then be left with patches and messy lacing. Just right. 
S- Very nice. I remember it being stronger fresh from the brewery but the grapefruit, berry, subtle pine and perfect alcohol all smell great. Not entrancing (like some DIPAs but this isn't a DIPA). It smells great. 
T- Grassier than the smell, but still very floral and citrussy. Grapefruit rind taste and bitterness. Tasty. 
M- Well this is a relatively old growler so I might be off. Fizzy, very, very dry. I remember this being more effervenscent. Very good body. Especially for how light and easy to drink it is. 
D- Great. Interesting with lots to taste but very little to offend (nothing really). Pretty much a perfectly drinkable beer.
Might be the best Vermont beer I've tried in my séjour here. Shared the growler with a bunch of wine drinkers and suprisingly (to me at least) they all liked it. Top notch. I'd obviously like some details to be different (more crazy floral hoppiness) but that's just me. Objectively, this is a close to perfect beer. 1,301 charactersYoonisaykul, Aug 10, 2010
4.25/5  rDev -3.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Just made a trip up to the Hill Farmstead a few days ago. Awesome place and great beers. Here's the write up on Edward.
Pours a cloudy, burnt orange with a thin white head. Nice lacing left on the glass. Looks good for an APA.
Orange citrus, peach, sweet malts and floral hops on the nose. I'm really liking the hop usage on this one. Not too bitter or grassy, just an elegant floral quality. 
Tipping back the glass reveals a decent amount of bitter hops, orange and grapefruit on the tongue. Touch of orange peel with light malts. Nice floral presence in the taste as well.
Mouthfeel is smooth with light carbonation. Malty at first with lingering bitterness on the finish.
Very drinkable and definitely a good session beer. Crisp and refreshing with light bitterness. This beer has a lot of flavor for an APA and is a pleasure to drink. Great for a lazy summer afternoon. Nice work Shaun. 896 characterssisuspeed, Jul 26, 2010
4.38/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Edward arrives at my table an ever so slightly hazy orange amber. It is dressed in a nonic pint glass with a wonderful frothy white head. The head has slightly above average retention, but leaves some of the prettiest lace I have ever seen, perfectly chronicling the volume of every sip on the side of the glass. The aroma is wonderfully fruity with a nice citrusy "C" hop vibe as well as some bright grassiness. I also catch a hint of bready malt in there. The taste is killer with plenty of citrusy grapefruit, lemon and pine hoppiness, as well as some more earthy and grassy notes. This is definitely a very hop forward APA, but it also has a very pleasantly bready, slightly caramel malt backbone that does its job well. It holds up firm bitterness and keeps this beer from being a tongue bruiser. This has to be the most enjoyable straight up pale ale that I have had in a very long time. The mouthfeel is pretty much perfection. Lighter side of medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation and an amazingly clean finish. This beer has great drinkability and I can very easily imagine throwing a few back with good friends. I am definitely looking forward to trying more of Hill Farmsteads offerings after enjoying this awesome brew. 1,241 characterszoso1967, Jul 25, 2010
3.86/5  rDev -12.1%look: 4 | smell: 3 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Edward pored a light amber with an inch of white head. Aroma was of fragrant hops, but seemed average for pale ales. Flavor was an excellent balance of sweet caramel malt, clean hop bitterness, and spicy hop flavor. It had more of a hop presence than I expected from a Pale Ale, but it was still balanced and pleasing. 318 charactersamccormi, Jul 24, 2010
4/5  rDev -8.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4I had this last night at Eulogy in Old City Philadelphia. The bartender described this beer to me as a Belgian-style IPA, but it didn't really have any of that complexity that I expected from a Belgian yeast. So now that I came here to BA to see this listed as an APA it slightly changes my ratings.
The beer was an amber orange, clear with no head. The smell was of fruity hops and a clementine orange and grapefruit aroma that I associate with Amarillo or C hops hops. The beer tasted almost solely of hops: grassy, herbal, with a sustaining bitter finish. The body of the beer was a little thin but good to style, with a dry finish. This was a good beer that I would order again 682 charactersSoonami, Jul 24, 2010
4.12/5  rDev -6.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Pint poured at Bluebird Tavern in Burlington.
Quick review: Crystal clear yellow-amber with some thin white suds on top. Lots of spotting. Nose is super pine-y and dominated by dry, bitter hops. Tree bark, herbs, etc. Palate is crisp right from the get-go with very little residual sugar. The body is medium-light and the flavors are centralized by the dry/herbal hops. The bitterness creeps up and snatches any malt sugar back from your palate and the finish is clean and crisp.
A great summer IPA and more West Coast in style than the Abner (Imperial IPA). Nice work, Shaun! 578 charactersSFLpunk, Jun 27, 2010
4.38/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a golden color with a one-finger head into my glass. Looks gorgeous to my eyes.
The aroma is full of grassy, slightly floral hops with a hint of bready malt underneath.
Taste is crisp with grapefruit being the main citrus flavor that I can pick out from the hops. This is all about the hops but it doesn't go overboard either. 
The grassiness/citrus tones of the hops coat the mouth. Finishes well. As stated, no harsh flavors of any type.
Very good! Nice to have another local brewery in which to sample and this is a great beer to start with from Hill Farmstead. 574 charactersBrad007, Jun 14, 2010
4.5/5  rDev +2.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Growler received in a trade with the ever generous MtGoat thanks!
Appearance: Pours an attractive transparent pale orange with a 2 finger white crown that shows moderate retention and good lace.
Smell: The nose sings with fruity hops (pineapple and grapefruit mainly) and slightly dank juicy hops over a fairly pale and neutral bready malt base. 
Taste: Same as nose. Great blend of fruity hops, citrusy hops, and small notes of wet grass / flowers over a biscuity malt.
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with decent carbonation and a slight touch of heft that makes it satisfy.
Drinkability: I want to drink this all day long. 623 characterskoopa, May 19, 2010
3.68/5  rDev -16.2%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4On tap poured into an 8oz glass.
Pours a nice cloudy amber color with a very thin white head with a tinge of lacing. Nose is lacking here, it's fresh and light but not too hoppy.
Taste is refreshing and quite malty, I just had a chinooker'd so that mght be why I feel like there's so little hops here. Malt is really refreshing and almost reminiscent of a a German beer. It's a good beer but not a hop bomb at all. 416 characterskingcrowing, Apr 28, 2010
4.72/5  rDev +7.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5On tap at the Blackback Pub in Waterbury, VT.
A: Orange-ish color, good sticky head, a bit hazy. Rustic and appetizing appearance.
S: HOPS. Wonderful fragrance that *almost* makes it a shame to drink, as the aroma diminishes with every swallow. Over the top hop aroma that is mellow at the same time.
T: Wonderful. Lots of raw American hop flavor backed up by solid malt. Hops and malt blend perfectly; finishes smooth in spite of the IBU load. Lingers very pleasantly upon swallowing.
M: Medium bodied for an American IPA; sort of an English malt bill with American hops. The obvious comparison is Alchemist Holy Cow.
D: Fantastic. Again, referencing the Alchemist, this beer has the taste and drinkability of Holy Cow with the aromatics of Heady Topper - the best of both worlds. The hops are intoxicating in their own right; hard to believe this is only 5.7%ABV. 870 charactersskivtjerry, Apr 27, 2010
4.37/5  rDev -0.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Had this on tap at American Flatbread in Burlington, VT. A very fresh tasting and well balanced IPA with a solid backbone of hops. A well crafted amber-ish IPA. The freshness of the hops really jumps out of the glass. It's obvious the ingredients that went into this beer were of the highest quality. Very well done! Looking forward to more from these guys. 357 charactersabriggs1, Apr 27, 2010
