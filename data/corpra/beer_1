5/5  rDev +3.3%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 52016 vintage, bottle #80.  Roughly 4 oz pour into a white wine glass.  The balance of maple and coffee on both the nose and taste is truly remarkable.  I can't begin to explain or understand how a beer delivering so much flavor with this level of viscosity doesn't turn into a sweet diabetes bomb.  The mouthfeel is unreal; a velvet-like texture I've never quite experienced.  
I had been wanting and waiting to try KBBS for a very long time.  Considering all the talk about this beer, my expectations going in were extremely high.  This beer somehow eclipsed everything I thought it would be.  To put it in comparison, it was imbibed between 2014 Assassin and Label Us Notorious, and completely blew those two away.  Not even close.  Hope I'm lucky enough to have it again someday. 783 charactersThirsty_In_Chicago, Mar 23, 2017

Look: Dark, Thick, Oily. Thin head but had that nice espresso color to it. 
Smell: Rich maple the moment I cracked the the bottle. Once it was in the glass you could get a bit of the coffee/mocha flavor too it. 
Taste: Amazing balance of Maple, Coffee, stout. It was a complex journey of flavor. The barrel was really subtle, which I think is something that really makes this shine as a beer. The coffee wasn't a major flavor but maybe a bit over-roasted.
Feel: Rich, Syrupy goodness. 
Overall: Truly a delightful beer that I feel lucky to drink. I can see why it is so hyped and the skill that went into brewing it. 652 charactersCwaks, Mar 19, 2017

There is nothing I can say that hasn't been said already in all the other reviews...this beer lived up to the hype.

2016 Bottle(2oz pour)
Look - Black, little to nohead
Nose - insane, instantly waves of maple and from a distance
Taste - followed the nose with a divine balance of roastiness, maple notes and barrel
Feel - Thick,  lingered in the mouth and on the lips for what seemed like for a while

L: Pours an insanely thick dark mocha and chocolate syrup hue with a minimal rusty head
S: Upon cracking the cap an intense Grade B maple syrup aroma filled my nostrils. The maple is complemented by roasted coffee and Nestle Toll House chocolate chips
T: Insane. A complete breakfast in a glass - a hearty full stack of chocolate chip pancakes drowning in Fancy grade syrup and a full pint of Grade B. Molasses, caramel, and butterscotch round out the middle. Finally, a slightly bitter black cup of java on the finish - very complex
F: Thick, rich and syrupy.
O: I realize that KBBS needed another review like I need a hole in my head, but man, given the effort to track this one down I felt compelled to at least write some notes - maybe I'll share this review with my grand kids someday. This beer is effortlessly rich and complex. The barrel aging is subtle and lets the stout stand on its own two feet. All around this is incredible and one I feel fortune to have tried. 986 charactersFireman_RK, Feb 22, 2017

5/5  rDev +3.3%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 52016 vintage drank in the #proper KBBS 2016 glassware on 2/12/2017.  Bottle #438
Look - thick and oily, deep and dark brown, with minimal head.  About as little head as possible while still having some.  The lacing on this was incredible.  It just stuck all over the glass, which in the end, left a nice little sip after it all settled back down.
Smell - the maple is massive!  I am absolutely shocked at how strong the maple comes through after barrel aging.  It's sweet and lovely but the maple itself is quite unique of a maple flavor.  It's bold and awesome.  The barrel and coffee open up with warming but nothing overpowering.  The coffee was almost hidden till it really warmed.  The bourbon barrel and fudgey chocolate are way ahead of coffee but way behind the maple.
Taste - definitely follows the nose.  The coffee comes through a little more on the tongue than the nose.  It's almost espresso-like as opposed to coffee.  It is very straight forward, nothing too unique, but nothing short of exquisite.
Feel - thick AF.  Nothing compares to it except maybe Assassin 2014.  So much thicker than the next beer in line with thickness that I've had.  Unreal.  No booze at all.  Could chug this if I didn't want to take as long as possible to drink and enjoy.
Overall - certainly lives up to the hype.  Worth the long drive and chase for this vintage.  Would love to try previous year's but doubtful I ever will. 1,423 charactersrabbott2, Feb 13, 2017

Smell: "Maple pecan mocha ice cream", I immediately think to myself. I don't even eat pecans. Hershey's liquid chocolate, molasses, breakfast at Denny's, but in a good way. A slight charred note. And of course, whisky with a slight alcohol note. 
Flavor mostly follows the nose, though with a little less coffee than I would like and the addition of a slightly salty marmite/Vegemite umami note, which I'm learning comes from the whisky barrel. Still, incredible stuff. 
Mouthfeel is the thickest I've ever experienced, though certainly not on level with actual molasses or syrup. Perhaps more along the lines of milk, though finding an exact comparison is difficult.  
Save for its rather unsubtle profile, the beer is technically perfect, very complex, and easily rivals my other all time fave stout, Tree House's Good Morning, though for somewhat different reasons. 1,020 charactersWantonFaun, Jan 25, 2017

It is a little bit too sweet on the finish for me, but that's like saying Kate Upton's hair is too long, it's a personal critique of something (someone) that's damn near perfect.

Overall, this is a very good beer. I would even lean to say a great beer, but my personal preference, the syrupy style of RIS is just not what I am looking for. 567 charactersbismarksays, Sep 06, 2016

The aroma is quite strong, with lots of charred wood up front, then secondary notes of dark chocolate and maple syrup. Big sweet flavor, oily, with bittersweet chocolate, baking cocoa, torched wood, earth, more maple syrup, figs, some coffee grounds. Full bodied, chewy, with moderate carbonation. Warm finish with loads of sticky chocolate sauce, well roasted malts, vanilla, char, maple, espresso, raisins, figs. Delicious. Robust yet still exceedingly drinkable. Exceptional. 568 charactersleighton, Mar 01, 2016

Pours a viscous, motor oil black color, with a small dark brown head, soon collapsing to a tiny ring of lacing with some spider web in the middle of the glass. Leaves back a mix of tiny tubbles and an oily texture after swirling.
Although I opened this after more than a year of its release, the coffee is as dominant as it has been in fresh Mornin' Delight. In this though, the Bourbon adds to the complexity of the coffee, creating an unforseen richness of aromas on the nose, while maple syrup appears to be a bit muted. There is a luscious bakers chocolate quality in this, tying the oaken barrel and flowery, cold pressed coffee beautifully together, creating a spicy coffee bean decadence, amped up by a mix of molasses and syrup. Coffee itself has an earthen note to it, perfectly enhanced by the barrel, while vanilla blends into scorched malts, producing an intense, wood accompanied, spicy praline impression.
I cannot belive the mouthfeel on this is real. This is unbelievable smooth. Rich and creamy, while featuring one of the most intense tasting beers I've ever had. Its silkness remains throughout, soothing the warmer parts of the beer with whipped cream and just an unbelievable softness.
Tastes of fudge, earth and brownie batter right from the beginning, together with a sweet and bitter cold pressed coffee appearance, adding foremost a roasty quality to the taste. While the flavors evolve rapidly on the palate, its silk creaminess calmes the upcoming flavor onslaught, leaving everything enjoyable and detectable. Milk chocolate and cocoa nibs set on top of the outstanding creaminess, finding their counterpart in roasty malts and a genuine coffee bitterness, blending into earth. Has a hot peak, together with a flowery barrel dryness, while licorice and a rich chocolate coating, calm the well accentuated, spicy heat. Finishes surprisingly clean and soft, right after the short, burning glimpse, whipped cream works its magic, ensuring the beers world class mouthfeel, while complimenting its chocolate richness. Coates the tongue during the aftertaste, together with gently spiced vanilla and coconut bark, packing also a lingering dryness.
This beer is beautiful throughout, it is  indeed perfect. What I loved most about Mornin' Delight was its outstanding mouthfeel, but this one puts it to shame, by revealing a chewy smoothness, I have never experienced before in a beer. Its taste features a certain ambivalence, on the one hand it drinks fairly easy, due to its unreal silkness, while on the other hand it packs an unbelievable flavor range with a perfectly nuanced intensity to it.  Everything seems to be in perfect balance, while maple syrup gets partially replaced by the far more complex Bourbon barrel in comparison to the MD. I understand this beer is highly sought after, this time it is most certainly well deserved. 2,875 charactersaleigator, Dec 24, 2015

Look: Poured incredibly heavy, and had a certain weight to it as it filled my tasting snifter. Minimal head, jet black. 
Smell: Like nothing I had ever smelt before: intense roasted coffee with just a hint of pepper, dark chocolate, and nuances of maple. Oh yeah, and BOURBON. Really complex.
Taste: Tons of coffee on the tongue, with (what I consider) a perfect carb that just tickles the tongue. Lingering sweetness after the drink, then the amazing bourbon aftertaste that leaves you wanting more. 
Feel: Incredibly coating, almost oily. The taste lingered and developed for about 15 seconds after a sip. Once again, a fantastic carb on this one. 
Overall: Easily one of the best beers I've ever had the pleasure of trying. Would I go out of my way to get it again? Absolutely. Would I give up what it takes to get another one? Probably not. Awesome experience either way. 885 charactersjolly_lynch, Oct 17, 2015

5/5  rDev +3.3%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This beer was nothing short of spectacular. A deep, rich black color with fantastic lacing. The nose was unctuous. There was big wafts of maple syrup, fudge, vanilla and a perfect roast bitterness from subtle hops and perhaps the char of the barrel. The mouthfeel matched every part of the nose on this beer. It was viscous and chewy, but the marriage of all of those huge flavors kept it from being a mess, which I can only imagine how hard that had to be to brew. Huge vanilla, pancake syrup, and a roasted twinge of coffee bitterness. What a remarkable beer. I shared this with three friends at TG. Bottle courtesy of TG. What a great crew. 643 charactersWynnDavis, Aug 21, 2015

Simply amazing!  Poured from a 12 oz Vintage 2014 bottle into a small tasting glass (Thanks to the generosity of Mike & Clark for the first sample and Brandon for the second!)  The smell was out of this world; coffee, maple, vanilla, roasted malt, slight bourbon and oak.  Appeared very dark almost black with a dark tan head, very thick.  The taste followed the nose and was unlike anything I've ever tried before.  I was completely blown away by this stout, it surpassed the hype in my opinion.  I found myself waiting about 2 minutes between drinks, leaving enough time for the taste to linger and to again smell the stout.  Taste amplified over the first 30 seconds and the maple became stronger.  Overall extremely impressed with this release from Toppling Goliath!  I just wish it were more readily available as it is almost impossible to find.  5/5 879 charactersSprague67, Aug 18, 2015

The beer looks great- black as night with a beautiful head.   Smell is coffee and bourbon with a sugary sweetness behind it.   The sweetness is present in the taste as well, creating a somewhat uncomfortable mouth feel.    The coffee is outstanding, but the sweetness kills it for me.    I'd take BCBCS over this every day of the week. 549 charactersStarofSahara, Aug 09, 2015

What little head there is disappears into nothing very quickly. S- deep rich notes of roast, huge boozy bourbon followed by rich coffee. There is a subtle maple scent that follows the coffee in the back. T-  delicious flavor with the bourbon and the sweet vanilla, oak barrel. Lastly, after the swallow there's a strong maple presence that sits in your mouth for a long time and it develops and lasts for a long time and you don't want it to go away. Strong chocolate and vanilla notes also seep in during the mix. M- thick, creamy, velvety. The way a stout should feel. No carbonation. Completely coats your mouth and throat all the way down. O- Best stout i've every had. The flavors blend perfectly and each flavor is detectable. It's amazingly delicious. 884 charactersBeerCrazyCrow, Jul 14, 2015

Pours a dark, thick syrupy pour.  Smells unlike any stout I've had.  Definitely sweet maple, sweet barrel notes and roasted malt.  Smells amazing.
This is where Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout separates itself from others...taste and mouthfeel.  The taste is pure perfection.  Sweet, but not overly so.  Perfect blend of maple, barrel, coffee and roast.  Thick mouthfeel that clings to your entire mouth, making you want another sip.  
I wish this would be more readily available. 571 charactersWI-Beer-Man, Jun 15, 2015

So much maple and coffee on the nose. The beer itself is thick and palate coating. Perfect amount of sweetness from the maple, mixed with a complimentary but not overpowering touch of coffee. Truly world class. Gotta say...trades through the roof for a reason but it's a tiny bottle...hard pressed to ever catch me trading my cellar though. 449 charactersMonktastic7, Apr 30, 2015

4.55/5  rDev -6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Shared at DLD15. Silver wax. Served in a snifter.
Appears dark brown bodied, one finger bold brown head, good retention, no lacing. It looks just like Mornin' Delight does. Smells of sticky maple syrup, a fair bit of coffee, with a bit of oxidation, milk chocolate, a bit of bourbon. It doesn't smell a whole lot different than Mornin' Delight, but that's not a bad thing. However, on the palate, the bourbon comes through a bit more; casting an oaky presence in the background, very mild bourbon flavour/heat. The maple syrup still dominates as does the coffee, which I'll never complain about. Some milk chocolate and roasted malt backs it up. As with the base beer, it's a very two-note beer that the bourbon doesn't necessarily add much to. Mouthfeel is excellent, full bodied, sticky yet smooth, easy to drink. Overall this is a very good beer; it's not necessarily worth what it takes to get; economics aside it is an excellent stout that nicely balances two extreme flavours even if it's not particularly complex. No other brewer has been able to make a beer like this, with the exception of Tree House, so there has to be some points awarded for that.
Re-review: 2017 release, silver wax, bottle 849. Served in a KBBS glass, #properglassware. Thanks Dan. Pours a dark black body, one finger mocha head, good retention, not much lacing. Smell is whiskey, maple syrup and espresso, milk chocolate, oak, roast. The whiskey is pretty nice in this beer, actually, with a rich oak and vanillin contribution. Slight heat, which is also noticeable on the palate; which also introduces plenty of maple, coffee and chocolate in the mouth. A touch of vanillin, oak, and smoke. Mouthfeel is full bodied, slightly syrupy and sticky, good carbonation, nice finish. I still propose that Morning Wood from Funky Buddha is almost just as good for 5% of the asking price it takes to get a bottle of this, but hey, you do what you gotta do. 1,931 charactersStevedore, Apr 26, 2015

A:  Thick black pour reluctantly leaves the bottle and delivers a quickly receding mocha head.  After a few moments, only wispy small bubbles remain, clinging the rim.  Very oily legs effortlessly paint the glass.
S:  Coffee, roasted malt, sweet maple.  Burnt sugar.  Some type of spice--maybe cumin?  Tobacco, rye whiskey. 
T:  Sweet maple up front, roasty coffee in the middle and a lingering sweetened French vanilla coffee tail with a rye/bourbon boozy burn.  Ms. Butterwoth's pillow after the Kentucky derby.  Surprised at the nice retention of bourbon after many months since the release.  [side note: tried this with VBDL '14 and by contrast KBBS tasted bitter and darker].
M:  Fluffy pillow of velvet.  Thick, rich, nicely carbed.  Burn down the throat. Pretty much perfect for the style.
O:  Well, it's a great beer.  No doubt about that. 933 charactersTampaRainman, Apr 10, 2015

Smells of pure Maple.  The empty bottle still smelled days later.  Mouth feel was spot on as with all TG stouts.  Taste - it's just delicious.  Other beers are more complex (CBS for example) but this is just delicious.  Booze is well masked.  Easily in my top 4 beers. 378 charactersmportnoy, Mar 22, 2015

Opened a gold wax in the company of a few good men, basically what we call a normal Tuesday, whale slaying, gold wax from a Toppling Goliath snifter. The beer gave off the aromas of sweet brownies dipped in coffee, if that's a thing. Just understand that it was amazing, even before it touched my lips. As the beer traveled out of the glass into my mouth I began to levitate into the air, and fireworks were going off around me. Suddenly I realized I was actually hovering over my own self, watching myself drink this wonderful concoction. I recently had fresh CBS on tap, and thought that might be the pinnacle for my beer drinking of 2015, I was very wrong, that beer doesn't belong in the same sentence with KBBS. This is about as close to perfection in a beer that I believe is possible, especially for anyone who loves stouts. This is a must drink, must seek out beer, if only it was in a larger format. 1,008 charactersthereal_adam, Feb 04, 2015

My boy Adam was being swooped away by a double unicorn led chariot. What do I mean? It was amazing. Truly a trancendent stout. It was flat out the greatest stout ever made in America. And wel I haven't tried everyone, but I've tried everyone enough from the list. 
The smell, taste, aftertaste, feel, and dat maple dho, just perfection incarnated. Wasn't hot for fairly fresh either, can't wait to try the next couple little bit down the line. 714 charactersAbbbp, Feb 04, 2015

12oz gold wax provided by Syndicate in a homerun tasting... Darrel is good peeps and should be given the utmost trader elbow room IMO.
Pours impossibly thick.. dark brown/black viscous brew.. the the head is dark brown and dies back quick but the sugars hold on leaving nice lacing.
Thick nose.. sweet and never over done... tons of character.. maple with big coffee and dark toast.
Flavor is again just amazingly full.. from front to back the dark malt moves silky into the bourbon and dark cherry... soooo thick and full.
Very tasty, but not worth the hype... Not even close.
Darrel deserves a nice slow.. golf clap for acquiring this one.. clap clap clap.
Thanks my friend.

4.89/5  rDev +1%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.7512oz bottle, 2014 date with gold wax, poured into a Toppling Goliath teku. Enjoyed on 12.13.14, shared with my dad, review is from Tasting Journal.
The beer pours a jet black color, motor oil consistency, very thick and viscous out of the bottle with a lovely finger or so of mocha colored head, thick, taut and firm that has superb retention yielding a few spots of lace but with great dark staining legs. The aroma is fantastic, loads of smooth chocolate, coffee is assertive, but at the same time mild, lightly roasted with a nice fruit character that helps accentuate the stone fruits that come out in the nose, charred oak and whiskey with a bit of toffee sweetness linger well and just a splat of maple that helps curb any heat from the barrel and the bitterness from the coffee. The barrel character is what leaps out to me on the tongue, very smooth, nice mix of charred oak, lightly chewy and soft bourbon, a bit of toffee, a bit of molasses, even a touch of spice while smooth and decadent chocolate, lightly bittersweet, rolls over and brings forward stone fruits with lightly roasted and fruity coffee. The balance is supreme and the finish has just a breath of warmth to it from the barrel. The mouthfeel is perfection, thick, rich, creamy, viscous, silky, smooth, coating, any adjective you like for a stout, this has it, carbonation is perfect, enough life while being totally forgotten yet it also doesn't feel too sticky or clumpy, and the finish is incredibly fluid. 
Verdict: A lot of hubbub and noise about this beer and it's all deserved. The balance and complexity is tremendous, everything in true harmony, no one characteristic is truly defining and each aspect of the beer is artfully mastered. 1,721 characterskevanb, Dec 14, 2014

A- pitch black with virtually no head. What little head there is disappears into nothing very quickly. 
S- deep rich notes of roast, huge boozy bourbon followed by rich coffee. There is a subtle maple scent that follows the coffee in the back.
T- oh my god. Heat from the bourbon sits up front and hits your palate like spartans against the persians. Then a shot of espresso covers your mouth and melds deliciouslu with the bourbon and the sweet vanilla, oak barrel. Lastly, after the swallow there's a strong maple presence that sits in your mouth for a long time and it develops and lasts for a long time and you don't want it to go away. Strong chocolate and vanilla notes also seep in during the mix. There is only one beer that beats this on taste. 
M- thick, creamy, velvety. The way a stout should feel. No carbonation. Completely coats your mouth and throat all the way down.
O- one of the best stouts i've every had. The flavors blend perfectly and each flavor is detectable. It's amazingly delicious. I wish i had an infinite amount of this. 1,104 charactersmlhyatt, Dec 13, 2014

5/5  rDev +3.3%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 52014 release. Poured a thick, thick, thick stream. Little head with small pour, but carb is there. The nose is beautiful blend of coffee and maple, with slight bourbon, absolutely stunning. The taste is transcendental, follows the nose perfectly. Never anything ever come close to this in term of actually tasting the smell. This beer has the most incredible mouthfeel of any beer I've ever had, that's including Lawson's Maple Tripple which brewed entirely on maple syrup and Tree House Good Morning which absolutely killed it with the mouthfeel. 
This is my favorite beer of all time. I was really hoping for this beer to be a bust because how difficult it is to obtain. Loving it means I have to try to get more. Damn it! 725 charactersmythaeus, Nov 29, 2014

5/5  rDev +3.3%Many thanks to Patrick for sharing this at his birthday tasting!  
A: like black coffee, very slight head, leaves minimal legs on the side of the glass
S: maple syrup, maple syrup, and more maple syrup; lots of bourbon barrel, slight bourbon sting, slight coffee and chocolate...did I mention maple syrup?
T: maple syrup, coffee, chocolate, not as much bourbon taste but slightly hot bourbon sting; tastes like a candied maple chocolate candy dipped in a mocha; lots of coffee aftertaste that lingers on the tongue along with a slight bourbon sting; amazing
M: sweet without being cloying; well carbed
O: if it were a perfect world, everyone would have multiples of this and drink one now and age one.  On one hand, all the flavors are there and well balanced.  However, six months would smooth out that slight hotness and temper the maple syrup.  Small nits, one of the best beers I have had. 898 charactersIrishColonial, Oct 25, 2014

5/5  rDev +3.3%Bottle opened on 10/12/2014 graciously by @Hey5hitgoose.  2014 Vintage
Pours absolutely pitch black with a 1/4" dark chocolate colored head that dissipates relatively quickly.  It was hard to pay attention to the head when the beer itself is so amazingly oily and viscous looking.
The nose is dark roasted coffee and sweet maple syrup, and then of course the bourbon.  Each smell is distinct and seems absolutely perfect, with none over powering each other but working together in hamony.
Maple, Chocolate, coffee, vanilla are all present unify perfectly.  The amount of maple in each sip is incredible, and the coffee adds a nice touch.  The bourbon is absolutely perfect, not incredibly overpowering, but strong and present.  
The oily sludge coats the glass and the mouth, but is not cloying, rather makes you just want to continue sipping as the flavors start to fade away.  
Overall I guess I wish this beer wasn't so incredible considering the insane amount of effort it  takes to obtain one (unless of course you live in Decorah).  Alas, it was truly one of those beers that I am glad to say that I have had the opportunity to try and will certainly look forward to having it again, despite how long it may take for that to happen.  Certainly worth breaking out a rating of 5 due to how amazingly well crafted this beer is.  I have only had a couple of other BA stouts that are even in the same league.  I certainly hope TG can start making this in larger batches  in years to come. 1,494 charactersChibeerguy1, Oct 14, 2014

5/5  rDev +3.3%2014 gold wax bottle. Poured into a snifter.
A- Pours a jet black with a half inch of mocha foam that takes it's time receding. Light does not pass through this beer. When swirled, this beer laces so well that it takes seconds for the beer to finish falling off the sides of the glass. Extremely impressive. After the head recedes, a small ring of foam remains around the edge of the glass.
S- Caramel brownie dunked in a cup of coffee. Outstanding smell. 
T- strong maple sweetness up front followed by some chocolate notes and finished up with slightly bitter coffee/roast notes that just tie it all together and keeps it from becoming overly sweet. Amazing depth of flavor yet balanced enough to have you coming back for the next sip quickly. 
M- Rich and silky. Full body on this beer. Notch below those Zhukov thickness levels, which is perfect. Very sticky
O- This is an amazing treat. I hope some day Toppling Goliath can release this in much greater amounts. The world needs to try this beer. One of the best beers I've ever had. I cannot find a weakness in this beer. I feel blessed that I had a chance to have this. 1,131 charactersHugonaut13, Sep 16, 2014
4.25/5  rDev -12.2%review of 2014 Gold wax KBBS. First I would like to say that I have had a good 4 ounce pour of 2013 kbbs on two separate occasions and this 2014 was shared with my friend with 6oz pours each.
A: 4.25/5 pours an almost solid black with quarter inch mocha head from a semi vigorous pour.  head fades to nothing within a few seconds. 
S: 4.5/5 maple forward with a strong coffee presence followed by slight alcohol and fudge. not nearly as sweet smelling as last year and lacking that beautiful maple syrup and chocolate bomb of last years batch. 
T: 4/5 at first there is nice sweet maple but then the huge coffee astringency hits you and bitter coffee dominates the palate. The barrel and maple are there but are overshadowed by the coffee. though the huge coffee profile may subside over time, It seems that the bitter astringency will never fade as its a bitterness  oily issue. 
M: 4/5 not nearly as creamy and silky as last years or even lesser beers like Assassin. The finish from the coffee is almost slightly dry and the maple and barrels don't shine as they should. 
O: 4.25/5 Overall this is a good beer that unfortunately happens to not be the beer that it was in 2013. 2013 was a life changing experience and almost didn't disappoint in anyways. I enjoyed drinking 2014 but was turned off by the unbalanced coffee presence and bitter astringency. 1,362 charactersLucho, Sep 15, 2014

5/5  rDev +3.3%Picked up a 2014 bottle in the Brewery on the day of the release. Gold wax covers the cap down to the bottom of the neck of the bottle.
Poured into a snifter.
A: Thick, viscous, motor oil appearance. Little to no head, what was there dissipated and just remained at the edge of the glass.
S: This was hands down the best beer I've ever smelled. Bourbon, maple, coffee, Carmel, sweet smells. If there was an air freshener of this I would buy them all....every last one.
Taste: Just as good as the smell. Bourbon, coffee, maple syrup, chocolate, vanilla, hint of toffee. All of the tastes I just mentioned seem to be equally dispersed in the beer no real dominate taste, a perfect mix. There was a slight warm alcohol presence when I first sipped but as it warmed it completely disappeared. 
M: Thick, rich, filling. Coats your mouth hole and sticks to it. Absolutely wonderful. One bottle is like a meal, but you just want to go back for seconds, thirds, and fourths.
Overall: Think of KBS on steroids with the addition of maple syrup and you have KBBS. Does it meet the hype? In my mind yes. Absolutely wonderful beer that I cannot find flaws with. I was discerning during drinking and tried to find issue with it.  I take that back, there was an air bubble between the label and the bottle, I squeezed it out...flawless. 1,326 charactersGerberr, Sep 06, 2014

From a bottle into a snifter
Vintage: 2013
Silver wax
Bottle X of 300
Whisky barrel aged with coffee
APPEARANCE: Same as Morning Delight. Pours out black and thick, yielding a smell, medium looking, creamy, dark mocha colored head with great retention. Jet black body with no carbonation evident. Head slowly fades to a swirly wisp and bubbly ring. A faint wisp and ring remain leaving some falling dots of lacing down the glass. Thick black body and a great head, and just a touch more lacing would give it a perfect score. 
SMELL: Basically like Morning Delight with some whisky barrel aging. Maple, caramel, butterscotch, coffee, milk chocolate and vanilla cream, with some whisky and oak pulling it all together. Really decadent. Bold and infinitely complex, with lots of aromas all over the place. Morning Delight was already a perfect score, so too bad this one doesn't go to 11. 
TASTE: Outstanding. Lots of maple syrup, caramel, whisky and oak up front, with more sweet butterscotch, maple and barrel flavors at the swallow. Definitely maple and coffee with a big, lingering finish of bitter coffee and dark chocolate, coconut, sweet vanilla, whisky and oak coating the palate. Very flavorful, complex and absolutely delicious. Wonderful sweet flavors with just enough bitterness and whisky barrel to provide the perfect balancing touch. Just great. 
PALATE: Medium body and medium levels of carbonation. A touch lighter than Morning Delight, but still full enough for the style. Very creamy smooth on the palate, goes down smooth and finishes slightly sticky. A bit of heat lingers as well. Good feel. 
OVERALL: Though it doesn't claim to be, this could very well be barrel aged Morning Delight. Absolutely fantastic. This has everything I loved about MD and added a touch of whisky barrel aging on top of it. One of the rare, rare occasions when a beer of this magnitude surpasses its billing. This is the best barrel aged imperial stout out there at this point, and I can't imagine being able to surpass this either. Would love to drink some of the second batch that is apparently waiting patiently at the brewery. Thanks again cparles. World class. 2,324 charactersJeffo, Jul 09, 2014

Taste is unbelievable. I will have to say, this is probably one of my top 5 favorite beers I've tried, only falling shortly behind Morning Delight. What a pleasure to drink, with a thick creamy chocolate milk taste, with a sweet taste on the back end, and a little bit of fruit on the back end it seems. So incredibly smooth, would never guess this is 12% abv. Wish I could try this ago, but most likely we will never meet again kbbs... 630 charactersMWolverines66, Jun 30, 2014

5/5  rDev +3.3%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5The beer pours out extremely dark black like motor oil.
The aroma shoots out of the bottle even a couple feet away as one pours it out. There's big chocolate, roasted coffee, huge caramel and molasses sweetness, and whiskey. The aroma is very well integrated of complexities.
The flavor follows with huge chunky milk chocolate surrounded by a medium roast earthy coffee and medium minus notes of whiskey. The beer transitions onto a big dark caramel sweetness with mocha coffee, a hint of berry fruits on the finish.
The mouthfeel is thick and luscious.
Just a beautifully crafted barrel aged brew. Nothing really jumps out aggressive with a harmony of whiskey, medium minus barrel notes, coffee, chocolate, and caramel sweetness. 734 charactersdar482, Jun 30, 2014

A - Appearance is just like MD, dark as night with minimal dark mocha foam head that recedes back into the glass. Extremely thick as it pours into the glass. Minimal lacing (small pour)
S - Smell is pretty much like Mornin' Delight in the maple syrup, chocolate, vanilla, coffee. Then the bourbon oak vanilla smell comes through from the barrel. The barrel smell does not at all overpower the base beer.
T - Taste follows the nose with huge notes of maple syrup chocolate coffee goodness. Vanilla notes with oak and bourbon are on the finish. Definitely one of my favorite tasting stouts of all time. This was after BA Abraxas and Vanilla Bean Assassin. I think this was my favorite of the 3.
M - So chewy and delicious. Coats the mouth and stays there
O - From a small pour I was able to tell so much. After having MD i could tell that this was the BA version of that. It is one of the best barrel aged stouts ever brewed.
2014 Gold Wax KBBS poured and split amongst friends
This is pretty similar to 2013 in terms of mouthfeel and barrel character. It doesn't quite have the maple finish that 2013 did but the coffee is definitely better in this years. Decadent smooth creamy mouthfeel, TG nails their mouthfeel in all of their big stouts. 
I have to say that this is still my favorite BA Stout that I have had, slightly ahead of DBH, BA Abraxas, BA Coffee Abraxas, PvW Black Magick, BA Lumber. This outshines them all. I wish it wasn't so damn hard to get, but seek this one out in confidence. 1,662 charactersdrmcleod10, Jun 07, 2014

A- Bottle * of 300, whatever that means! Poured into my Toppling Goliath snifter, it is black as a moonless, starless night. It is thick and viscous, with a medium sized brown head that slowly recedes to a tan collar that leaves some lacing.
S- The aroma is nearly identical to the base beer, but with bourbon and oak as well. Tons of burnt sugar, black strap molasses, coffee, and bitter baker's chocolate. Licorice, vanilla, sweet/buttery bourbon, rich dark chocolate, and some burning alcohol. Smells incredible!
T- Wham! I just got smacked in the face with awesome! The flavor delivers above and beyond the aroma and the base beer! It has all the sweetness from the base, but it is tempered and mellowed by the bourbon and oak. The chocolate, burnt sugar, molasses, coffee, and vanilla all come together in a complex melange of flavor. While flavor-wise I may slightly prefer Double Barrel Damon, this is perfect in it's own way!
M- The mouth feel is spot on. Thick, viscous, mouth coating, yet with ample carbonation.
O- What can I say? Toppling Goliath has delivered one of, if not the best BA stouts in the world! Just incredible all around! 1,185 charactersSadMachine, Feb 15, 2014

Nose is strong coffee, clean and roasted, notes of maple and vanilla with a well balanced bourbon and wood. Taste is a little sweeter, very big with lots of roasted coffee, well integrated bourbon and vanilla with some slightly charred wood, malt berry sweetness in the finish. Roast lingers, full bodied, creamy and moderate carbonation. Well balanced, lots of coffee with a fair bit of bourbon and malt sweetness, can get a hint sweet. 480 characterscpetrone84, Feb 02, 2014

Pours solid thick and heavy, minimal lacing. Dark black, very little carbonation. 
Taste is like bourbon maple syrup. Also some dark plums and dark fruits, however, overall, taste is more bourbon and less coffee than Mornin Delight. This is less sweet and more bourbon forward than MD. Good to try but Assassin and MD are my tops. 362 charactersRish907, Jan 11, 2014

Pours black, mocha head, thin ring, wisps on top. Nose is rich milk chocolate, coffee, burnt sugars, some bakers chocolate. Flavor is maple syrup, chocolate brownies, light oak, smooth alcohol, caramel, and coffee. Full body, rich, light carbonation, sweet & creamy finish.
This is one of those beers that came along in 2013, was super-hyped, and delivered. I easily finished half of the bottle and shared the rest and was still left wanting more. Very rich & decadent but very smooth and easy to drink for such a huge beer. 599 charactersSean9689, Dec 26, 2013

M - Incomparable mouthfeel. Silky, creamy, smoothness. Like whole whipping cream. Insane.
O - This one lives up to the hype. Not a bourbon bomb. If you are not a huge fan of bourbon flavors this is your new favorite. As a gigantic bourbon fan, I don't feel slighted, because the base beer carries this past the need for barrels. KBBS is a uniquely exquisite drinking experience.

S - Smells like Mornin Delight, but with some bourbon.
T - The taste is where this beer falls short of Mornin Delight. The coffee and maple amazingness is muted by the bourbon here. It's potentially the first bourbon barrel stout I've had that's better without the barrel.
M - Higher booze than Mornin Delight too. That said, it's still very smooth and not much booze for the abv. It's just hard to live up to the incredible-ness that is Mornin Delight.
O - I'm not sure how this has a higher rating than Mornin Delight. Mornin Delight was superior to all the people I know who have had both. It wasn't terribly close to me. Mornin Delight would be over a 5 if I could give it that. This is still incredibly good, don't get me wrong (I mean look at the score I'm giving ). But I would seek out MD over this 10 times out of 10. 877 charactersnrs207, Oct 19, 2013

5/5  rDev +3.3%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Reviewing the highly sought after Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout (KBBS) from my friends at the Toppling Goliath Brewery out of Decorah, Iowa. This beer is billed as a "beer aged in whiskey barrels with coffee" on the label.
Score: 100
2013 vintage bottle served in a Upland snifter and enjoyed on 09/22/13.
Appearance: Slick and shiny motor oil black in color. Pours a thin layer of dark khaki head that settles to a thick ring around the glass. Excellent lacing, amazing retention. The lacing slowly cascades back in to the glass like a viscous oil. 5/5
Smell: Like Morning Delight, the nose is bold and well integrated. Notes of maple/molasses syrup, bourbon, coffee and vanilla. Smells a lot like Bliss, the bourbon aged maple syrup, blended with coffee. Light notes of chocolate chip cookies. A dash of doughy cake batter too. Smells like Morning Delight plus vanilla, but with dialed down chocolate notes. As the beer warms up, the maple/molasses syrup-like aroma becomes more prominent. 5/5
Taste: Sweet maple and molasses flavor upfront, then vanilla. Roasty coffee flavors and faint, but detectable, chocolate on the back half. Underlying coffee backbone really helps balance the upfront sweetness. No booziness, but there is a little alcohol warming effect on the palate as the beer warms up. The vanilla and maple/molasses syrup flavors shine through more as this beer warms up too. This is truly delectable. 5/5
Mouthfeel: Fully bodied, spot on carbonation. Creamy, oily mouthfeel. Shares the same umami character I got from Morning Delight (no soy sauce flavor). Balanced, though sweet leaning. Has a nice bitterness to the finish that imparts easy drinkability to cut through what would otherwise be a layering sweetness. 5/5
Overall: I am not sure if this is a barrel aged version of Morning Delight, but it shares many of the same characteristics. Both this and Morning Delight are incredible, but I thought that KBBS was the superior brew of the two. The vanilla notes from the barrel aging here are lovely. This beer is, for all intents and purposes, perfect. Among the many stouts I have consumed, there are only a couple out there that I would rather have if forced to choose. With luck, Toppling Goliath will rebrew this and our paths will cross again one day. If not, I am truly glad to have had the opportunity to tick this. Even at its hefty cost, I recommend seeking out a bottle; this is probably going to be the best beer released in 2013.
Cost: $12 for a 12 oz bottle. 2,500 charactersjegross2, Sep 27, 2013

Marshmallow vanilla smells. Maple become apparent after a sip.
Maple dominates. Roasty. Barrel presence and coffee are there but like I said maple. Would put this at about 13.5%abv if I had to guess.
Nice and thick mouthfeel. Low, perfect carbonation point.
After having both this and Mornin' Delight I will say that i like them close to equally. the maple aspect of this guy is a little overbearing, CBS wishes it had that presence though. Thanks 4DAloveofSTOUT for the most hyped/valued/whatever beer I've had to this point. 635 charactersDuff27, Sep 22, 2013

A- Pours a decently viscous dark slightly brown black, fairly opaque jet black in the glass with some light purplish brown along the edges, very thin mocha brown head forms that has decent retention and fades at a moderate pace to a flat top, leaves thin lacing that fades back into the glass.
S- Aromas of rich maple syrup, integrated bourbon, dark creamy chocolate, a bit of oak on the backend. Very sweet smelling, but very pleasant and retaining a nice balance. Definitely above average aroma strength.
T- Dark creamy chocolate, sweet/sugary maple syrup, balanced and integrated bourbon, faint hints of oak. Finishes with a strong, rich maple syrup presence with balanced bourbon, oak, coffee, and creamy chocolate. Easily one of the best finishes I've experienced from a beer.
M- Thick, viscous, creamy, very drinkable, incredibly smooth especially at a surprising 13%, only a faint presence of alcohol, fairly low carbonation but appropriate for style.
O- This beer definitely blew me away and is 100% worth the hype, possibly one of my favorite beers to date. There were a ton of strong, rich tastes coming out but it still retained a very nice balance and drinkability. I wish this was made on a regular basis and wasn't so rare so I could drink it all the time. I definitely recommend seeking this out especially if you like big, rich, balanced stouts. 1,491 charactersjaasen64, Aug 03, 2013

A: Dark thick and viscous with a puffy marshmallow head with great retention.
S: Maple syrup bourbon pancakes. Hints of Vanilla, very nice.
T: The bourbon is the predominant note that fades into coffee and bittersweet dark chocolate, not as much Maple as the nose would suggest. Also on the back end there was this Splenda/Aspartame-like artificial sweetness that really detracts from this beer, a characteristic I also noticed with Assassin.
M: Chewy, thick, wonderful. Perfect.
O: This beer is pretty good, but in all honesty it's not better than CBS was fresh. Really not worth what it takes to track down, and not even close to being a "Perfect 5" beer. 696 charactersAnonymous1, Jul 29, 2013

Pours a .25 finger dense, dark chocolate head with moderate retention. Beer is rich, thick and pitch black. Lacing is spotty and sparse with little cling. Probably the biggest, oiliest legs I've ever seen on a beer. Ever part of this screams imperial. 
Nose is a hot fudge Sunday with a side of pancakes and bourbon maple syrup. Very aromatic. Outstanding. 
Notes of maple syrup, chocolate, fudge, and molasses. Very chewy with loads of pancake and waffle and the slightest hint of bourbon that serves to complement the cornucopia of breakfast flavors perfectly. Now THIS is a breakfast stout if I've ever come across one. Finishes sweet and syrupy with a sticky, molasses and chocolate aftertaste. Phenomenal! 
Full bodied with low carbonation. Slick and oily in the mouth and goes down smooth and viscous. Messy finish with a lingering aftertaste. Real drinkable for 13% but definitely a sipper. 
This is easily one of the best and most unique imperial stouts I've ever had the opportunity to try. I'm not sure where Toppling Goliath came from but between this and Morning Delight, they have the market cornered on breakfast style imperial stout. Kentucky Brunch is simply amazing and I could drink this over and over and over again. 1,376 charactersSpeedwayJim, Jul 12, 2013

Appearance - Inky black. Stains the glass again. Bigger and darker head than Mornin' Delight and Assassin. Great surface wisps.
Smell - Bourbon. Maple. Vanilla. Dark chocolate. Everything you'd want in a stout. The bourbon does take over, though.
Taste - Bourbon is sharp. Coffee comes out here. Dark chocolate. Maple comes out in the back. Sweetness lingers. Bourbon flavor lingers also.
Mouthfeel - Very thick. Boozy. Sweet with medium carbonation. 
Overall - Tough to argue which is better, but bourbon always wins. 578 charactersAlieniloquium, Jul 02, 2013

5/5  rDev +3.3%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5OK, time to drown this puppy. Picked up at the release (where there were numerous Minnesota beer geeks in attendance) & this is the lone & single bottle resting in the fridge. Now resting in my glass. Well, half in my glass, half in my wife's glass. 12 oz. bottle with silver wax. 
The pour is dark night, carbonation close to the non-existent side. The nose - wow. Like the best pancake house in the world, with grade A maple syrup made in house & a cold press coffee place beside the kitchen. Then the waitress sets a glass of bourbon next to the syrup. Seriously. Magnificent. 
Kentucky Brunch is one of those beers that can't possibly live up to the hype, right? Wrong. More maple syrup taste than any beer I've ever come into contact with - & I like small-batch, artisanal maple syrup almost as much as I like beer. And I swear I can taste the waffles. Big bourbon wallop is cut by just the right amount of coffee; not enough to tip this into an annoying coffee bomb, but enough to get a taste. Mild chocolate & vanilla & drying wood in the middle. The end is pure bliss. Thick, thick, thicker, but ridiculously drinkable. I'm thinking of stealing my wife's half & making a run for it. I'm faster than she is. She'd never catch me before I finished it. 
Holy bloody hell. I wish I'd have brought 36 mules to the release, because I would have drunk every single bottle in a span of about 20 days. This is a beautiful beer, & I hope it turns into an annual release. No, screw that, a weekly release. This beer is...perfect. My fourth perfect score in 1500 reviews. Wow. Reaching for my wife's glass... 1,607 charactersmaximum12, Jun 28, 2013

Taste is unreal - again, lots of coffee which gives way to a mild bourbony sweetness. Not too boozy. Lives up to all the hype and then some. 256 charactersHoppyMcStout, Jun 27, 2013

4.88/5  rDev +0.8%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Bottle # 110 of 300. This bottle has been tempting me ever since it showed up on my doorstep. Thanks isn't enough to maximum12 for sending me a bottle completely unexpectedly.
A - Pours thick and black with about a quarter inch tan head, which dissipates fairly quickly, leaving a thin ring.
S - Reading some of the reviews on here, I was expecting to get a wave of coffee as soon as I popped the cap, which I really didn't get. But as it warms, the aromas really begin to shine. Maple and bourbon are dominant, while the coffee hangs out in the background. There's just enough heat in the nose to let you know this one is a sipper.
T - This is where it's at. Honestly, this tastes like a plate of bourbon and maple syrup soaked chocolate chip pancakes followed by a sip of really good coffee. I have no other way to accurately describe it. It's fantastic and unlike anything I've ever tasted before. I have no idea how they got so much maple syrup flavor into one bottle. But at the same time, it's nowhere near cloying in any way. The coffee plays second fiddle to the maple, chocolate, and bourbon, but there's enough there to tie it all together.
M - Carbonation is spot on. This is thick and silky. It feels like velvet on the tongue.
O - At 12%, I'm trying to take this one slow but it's disappearing way too fast from my glass. I was really curious to see if this would live up to it's lofty expectations. Not only did it live up to them but it surpassed them. I hate to gush but this is just really fucking good. I'll be sad when my glass is empty. 1,561 charactersmoose3285, Jun 21, 2013

12oz Bottle poured into a Bourbon County snifter. Poured along-side a 2012 Barrel Aged Dark Horse Plead the 5th and a 2013 KBS as part of a side-by-side tasting.
Appearance: Dark, reddish, brown almost black with a small 1/4" head bubbling up. The head recedes to a thin cap but leaves a heavy, frothy, tan ring. This beer looks viscous and leaves some very nice sticky lacing.
Smell: Sweet maple front and center, I've never had this much maple in an beer I've smelled, it towers over both the bourbon and chocolate that you can sense underneath. Amazing nose on this beer.
Taste: There are a lot of flavors to pick out of this one with oak, vanilla, whiskey, chocolate, and coffee standing out and having each element wrapped in a blanket of maple. As the beer warms the flavor deepens but never loses balance, all of the flavors continue to stand out. There is a sweetness to this beer (with this much maple flavor it would be impossible for it not to have sweetness) but it is never overwhelming, it never verges on becoming "too much". I can't imagine a better tasting stout.
Mouthfeel: Silky smooth and although sweet it never becomes cloying.
Overall: I am a fan of maple flavor in a stout; therefore, this was the best barrel aged stout I have had to date. Left me wanting nothing but more. 1,384 charactersBobZ, Jun 16, 2013

Normally, I would start with the appearance, but as soon as I popped the cap, I was flooded with coffee aroma. I have never smelled coffee so intense in a beer. It pours out so dark and thick -- two more extremes I have never seen the likes of.
The smell? Coffee, toffee, chocolate, all manner of dark fruit. As it warms, maple begins to emerge, then eventually dominate. It delivers all of this and more as I drink it. It's a sipper, to be sure, but it is one of the most enjoyable beers I have ever tasted.
Mouthfeel is great. It's full and creamy, with restrained carbonation. If this beer has a flaw, I suppose it's a tad sweet. But I will dream about this one for a long time. 736 charactersDaveAnderson, Jun 06, 2013

reviewed from notes taken 6/1.
Appearance: black bodied beer with dark brown head. It looks exactly like Morning delight.
Smell: Smells exactly like morning delight, but has a splash sweet and mellow of bourbon. The coffee and maple syrup are more prominent in the nose and do infact overpower the bourbon.
Taste: Tastes just like it smells! Its morning delight with a mellow splash of bourbon! The mellow bourbon melds perfectly big maple syrup and bold roasty coffee. Clark just nailed this beer. Before I drank this beer I was concerned that the barrel notes would cover up all the things that make morning delight my favorite Toppling Goliath beer, but its honestly the Mornin' Delight is still the focus of this beer and the subtle barrel notes compliment it perfectly! 
Mouthfeel: medium bodied beer with moderate carbonation. Creamy, silky, and very smooth. This beer just coats your mouth with rich flavor. Not even a hint of booze, just like Morning Delight. Carbonation is spot on perfect. 
Overall: Its another Toppling Goliath masterpiece. I would say that its a tie, its really to close for me to call. I just cant decide which I like more... Morning Delight or Kentucky Brunch; honestly I feel they are equal! World class beer no question! This is a case where a non-barrel aged beer is just as good as the same beer with a barrel treatment. You dont see that happen to often in craft beer! Clark and company at Toppling Goliath are really making magic happen in Decorah, IA! 1,561 characters4DAloveofSTOUT, Jun 03, 2013

4.91/5  rDev +1.4%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75This was my first beer of the day at the release. 
Poured into a brand new Toppling Goliath snifter. 
Almost a finger width of head, very brown head with good lacing at the top of the glass. Some beer got on my hands and it was very sticky. 
Smell is of smooth bourbon with a hint of dark chocolate. Very sweet. The bourbon has no pepper smell.
First taste of the day was sweet dark chocolate filling my mouth with a creamy texture and just a little coffee/espresso around the edges not hurting the deep chocolate notes at all. nSubsequent sips brought out more of the bourbon flavors.
Mouthfeel is smooth and rich with viscous, thick body. The first drink was similar to the feeling of drinking the first few sips of coffee with a whip cream topper. 
Overall I loved it for it's deep savory flavors of coffee and dark chocolate with a body to hold those flavors together. The difference from Assassin to KBBS is that vanilla is the biggest flavor in Assassin and KBBS has a deep rich chocolate/coffee flavor that is distinct. 1,032 charactersErdinger2003, Jun 02, 2013

5/5  rDev +3.3%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Let's start this revew by saying that I have never had a Toppling Goliath brew before, this was my first. I am not a local, it took me 3 1/2 hours to drive here from Waukesha, WI. I can't buy TG in my area. I only state that as I feel many people are attributing the great scores on Mornin' Delight and KBBS to homerism.
Appearance - Deep blackish brown with a perfect one finger, medium brown head.
Smell - Aromas of dark roast coffee, whiskey, and a mild sweetness all jump out of the glass.
Taste - Wow, very complex. Tasty coffee, mellow whiskey, and a sweet maple syrup taste all intermingle on the palate. Some nice vanilla notes. Finishes with the dark roast of the coffee. For a 13% brew, the alcohol on this is very light. Delicious.
Mouthfeel - Incredibly smooth, no harshness from the coffee or the whiskey. Nice viscosity.
Overall - I was blown away by this beer. I had high expectations, which usually leads to disappointment. Not in this case. The brewery is aptly named, this beer is a BCBCS and KBS killer. 
Edit - The only reason I didn't give this a 5/5 is there was literally just a touch too much sweetness in the midpalate for me. Nitpicking, I know.
Edit Edit - After thinking this over, it deserves a straight 5. Equally as good as any other beer I have ever had, and better than most. 1,315 charactersthebigredone, Jun 02, 2013

Pour: pitch black with two fingers of deep brown head. Leaves light lacing, and the head dissipates rather quickly.
Smell: woah. Lots of sticky maple, coffee, and a light bourbon. Some toffee and vanilla. A really nice roasty char, but no smokiness. Decadent and inviting. As it warms, it smells identical to Mornin Delight.
Taste: lots of butterscotch, coffee, and smooth roast. Some vanilla bourbon, and a touch of maple. The barrel definitely took the distinct maple syrup quality of Mornin Delight and gave it a toffee like quality. Finishes creamy with bourbon, coffee, and toffee.
Mouthfeel: really very drinkable. Lighter carb than Mornin Delight, but just the right amount. Very creamy, especially as it warms. Very little bourbon heat. Finishes creamy, lightly sweet, and lingers for a long time.
Overall: amazing. I enjoyed this better than Mornin Delight because of its superb balance of flavors. Easily the best barrel aged stout I've had yet. Awesome. 1,043 characterscfrances33, Jun 01, 2013

4.67/5  rDev -3.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5This was served in a chalice-tulip. I reviewed this from notes. 
Appearance- The foam is a brown-sugar colored ring around the glass that leaves behind no lace. A completely black body looks great in the curvy glass.
Smell- First noticeable aspect is the iced mocha scent. It is slowly followed by some brown sugar and caramel syrup. I also get the flare of whiskey and oak. It smells incredibly rich and delectable.
Taste- So much whiskey and barrel oozing on the palate, with some coffee roast and leather as it flows over the tongue. The finish is very roasty and smokey.It takes a few sips, but the malt sugar also pervades the drink. Crazy good!
Mouth feel- The pub calls it "gluttonous", and I have to agree. The body is huge, silky, and chewy. Thanks to the stickiness, the finish never seems to end. 
Overall- Kentucky Brunch is the stuff dreams are made of. This offering would be perfect if the palate imitated the syrupy nose more directly. Instead of letting the smokey whiskey take over on the tongue. 
A fantastic, big brew with a fantastic feel and whiskey to spare. 1,087 charactersPintofbrown, May 16, 2012
4.6/5  rDev -5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Poured from tap into Chalice approximately 12 ounces.
A. Poured maybe a half finger of very dark tan head by the time it arrived to my hands. Not much lacing. Color is jet black.
S. Whiskey, oak, vanila, molasses, roasted malt, chocolate. Not overpowering on the aroma. Not a whole lot of whiskey barrel on the nose, but does impart subtlety. This beer reminds me of Bourbon County Stout in a lot of ways, which is saying something about this beer. Nice smooth smelling beer for a barrel aged imperial stout.
T. T. Nice whiskey, bourbon hints. Smooth. Oak, vanilla, chocolate, alcohol. Nice vanilla, milk chocolate sweetness. Tongue coating flavor. Again this reminds me of a smoother Bourbon County for some reason. I had one of these beers on Friday afternoon, and thought about it so much I had to go back and get another one on Saturday. Really big beer with a lot of flavors, but still smooth.
M. Full bodied. Tongue coating sweetness. Medium low carbonation. 
O. Damn good Imperial Stout. This beer made me crave having another one. Smooth but great whiskey flavor. This is really as good as a lot of the best barrel aged stouts that I have had. Mouth coating flavor. Really smooth for 13%. I found a lot of similarites to BCBS for some reason, but I can not remember BCBS ever being this smooth fresh. Having had Kentucky Brunch makes me very excited to try my bottles of Assasin. Kentucky Brunch needs to be put in a bottle soon. Toppling Goliath is putting out some really good beers.
5/6/12 Bottled Version
Poured from 12oz bottle into Globe glass.
A. Poured about a half finger of head. Color is jet black. Moderate lacing. Not much head retention.
S. Smells like bourbon. Coffee, vanilla, chocolate. Smells like I remember it on tap. Does smell a little hot. Molasess, roasted malt. Pretty heavy cofee aroma. 
T. Coffee, vanilla, roasted malt, bitter dark chocolate. Not super boozy on the taste, but you can fell that it is there. Really nice chocolate flavor on the back of the tongue. Big time flavor. 
M. Nice mouthfeel. Full bodied, close to being called chewy. Lingering bitterness on the finish. Low carbonation.
O. Lots of coffee flavor going on. Nice barrel aged characteristics as well. This was a delicous beer on tap, that really impressed me. Nothing different about this beer out of the bottle. Job well done TG! 2,350 characterssiradmiralnelson, Feb 26, 2012
