L-rich and dark, dark brown with a minimal head and thick lacing
S-scotch, caramel,  and a little sweet booze.  The Belgian candy sugar is noticeable here for sure.
T-this is where it becomes exceptional.  super complex.  this mainly is the rating at about room temperature because it kept getting so much better as it warmed that i saved most of it after about sitting 45 minutes.  Smooth apple brandy mixed with rich caramel, bourbon, oak, some fig and other dark fruits as well.
F-smooth, no heat, minimal booze.  goes down really nice.  the richness doesn't make it super drinkable but i wouldn't want that in this type either.  really enjoyable
O-a highly unique and complex beer that is done about as well as I could imagine.  Really exceptional.  The apple brandy barrel does overpower the bourbon barrel but who doesn't love apple brandy?!  Not as much smoke as expected but that's nitpicking.  This is exactly what I want in a barrel aged strong ale. 1,006 charactersrabbott2, Apr 13, 2016

L: Dark brown and caramel hues with an exceedingly thin sandy head and minimal retention
S: Scotch, dark fruits, tobacco, and hints of leather-bound books
T: Oddly complex and varied taste profile that ranges from granny smith apples to mocha coffee to toasted walnuts and butterscotch
F: Thick and full mouthfeel with minimal carbonation
O: This was an exceptional strong ale with an interesting flavor profile with incredible complexity. Honestly this is a phenomenal beer to pour, kickback and then ruminate while reflecting on life - excellent sipper here. 593 charactersFireman_RK, Apr 08, 2016

Taste follows the nose. Huge smoke presence on the taste. Very unexpected based on nose. Smoke dominates throughout. Get a coffee, vanilla, and bitter aftertaste. However, I taste smoke! Mouthfeel is good - I would characterize it as medium bodied. 363 charactersBeersnake1, Jan 07, 2016

Appearance: Pours a flat-cola looking, dark brown/almost black with no head or noticeable carbonation at all.
Smell: Boozy apple, slight hint of smokiness, dark fruits, very malty aroma along with some leather and tobacco. 
Taste: Not nearly as boozy as the nose would indicate. Hints of apple brandy, figs, sweet malts, caramel, and a nice smokey/peaty taste.
Feel: Very smooth, full body. The lack of carbonation actually helps this imo.
Overall: I've been wanting to try this beer for almost 5 years now and thankful I was able to thanks to a great friend. This is up there in my opinion with Adam from the Wood as my two favorites from HotD and I wish I had more than the one bottle of each that I've had. This is one of the best in the style of "American Strong Ale" that I've had in 10+ years of drinking craft beer. 909 charactersAxic10, Aug 24, 2015

Flat as usual with these HotD brews.  
Great "Old Ale" smell and taste.  Sweet, but not too much.  No smoke as was referred to in other reviews - perhaps the 2013 bottles were different from other vintages. 242 charactersWI-Beer-Man, Jun 01, 2015

A: Pours incredibly dense without a trace of head; viscous in appearance, thick and slightly oily; dark, burnt caramel color.
S: Deep sweetness, caramel/toffee, big malt, slight amount of peat, vanilla/charred oak, hints of alcohol.
T: Massive malty sweetness, lots of woodiness and vanilla, burnt sugar, molasses, dark candied fruits, subtle jam elements, hints of roasted nuts/peat.
M: Very light carbonation - surprising after four years in the bottle. Velvety smooth and slick, viscous and dense.
O: Another incredible offering from HotD, no one does high gravity beers that age as gracefully! I only wish I had another vintage bottle, but I'm excited to crack the 2013! 721 charactersDan_Inreallife, Dec 31, 2014

4.8/5  rDev +8.6%Absolutely stunning product.  
Per most HotD BA releases there is very minimal carbonation, but there is a very slight, soft fiz that works very well.  Pours out very dark brown.  Has the appearance of a dark old ale.
Fantastic aroma.  Apple brandy, bourbon, rich sweet smoke, dark malt, old ale musty quality - like an attic and leather. It is very rich and drier. 
The palate follows suit and the finish is strong.  Great balance of bitter and sweet.  Get the nice apple brandy and bourbon whiskey booze.  Has the great old ale quality, smoke, some dark wood and leather.
With adam from the wood as the best HotD beer I've had, and one of my favorites of all time.  94 674 characterstimc100, Nov 27, 2014

Appearance: Pours a dark brown with a slight orange-ish hue. Leaves a small off-white head.
Smell: Big smoked meats, sweet bourbon, oak, brandy, dark chocolate. Very interesting and different aroma.
Taste: Matches the aroma well, which is very nice: Bourbon, brandy, dark chocolate, cedar, nice smoky finish. Very well balanced flavors. Not overly sweet.
Mouth-feel: Low carbonation, but definitely enough. Full body.
Overall: This is a very tasty, and different beer. The interesting barrels have really put a twist on this and its really nice, smoky and sweet. Very well done brew. 713 charactersResuin, Jul 10, 2014

4.04/5  rDev -8.6%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3 |  overall: 3.5Big thanks to nate321 for knocking the off my longest-running want, as well as sending an overall killer box. 12 oz. bottle, 2013 vintage, consumed while my wife is off watching comedy, or something. 
The pour is on the left side of Hair: carbonation consists of a few startled bubbles that escaped the carbonation reaper, very dark brown. The nose is a screamer: like standing in the middle of a raw leather factory with bourbon nose plugs. Huge nose. There's brown sugar, molasses, underneath. One of the most aggressive aromas on a beer that I can recall & it's amazing. 
Matt is the kryptonite of subtle. If possible, the brown leather comes on even stronger in the mouth than in the nose, dominating to the point of drowning some of the lovely subtleties that peek out of the aroma. After the cat-o-nine-tails to the taste buds, the barrel shoulder its way in: supremely sweet vanilla, slow burning bourbon. No wood to speak of, surprisingly. Heavy hand of sugar pushes this into sweetness overload, & the caramel that loads up the back end catapults it off the cliff. As with many HotD beers, could have used some carbonation to keep it a touch lighter; I'll enjoy my 12 oz. of table syrup, but I'd have enjoyed it a lot more if it weren't beginning to dry into a concrete block in my stomach. 
So glad I got to try this. The lack of carbonation really hurts the last couple of categories, but you can't have everything. Especially with HotD, I suppose. Still a very good beer. 1,486 charactersmaximum12, Jun 13, 2014

The smell of the beer has some definite smoked malt coming off on the nose along with a good amount of dark malt. The taste of the beer has some nice barrel aged qualities to it along with some smokey sweetness. Overall it was always something I was hoping to try and finally did. I was glad I got the chance. 374 charactersKnapp85, Apr 06, 2014

Thanks to the fellow BA's for cracking this and several others
Reviewing from notes made in my head!
A - Pours clear dark brown color with minimal head and laving
S - Dark fruits is definitely something that came from the smell with some carmel notes
T - Taste is much the same on front end with dark fruits and a finish of carmel and tobacco
Figs and dates
M - Medium to full bodied and feels much like a stout
O - Overall I was very excited to try this and it is definitely the best HotD offering that I have had

Appearance – Pours a very dark brownish black color, with almost no head, except a light ring around the edge of the glass.
Smell – Bourbon, molasses, smoke, and apple.
Taste – A nice sweet bourbon flavor, with molasses and vanilla.
Mouthfeel – The alcohol was not hidden at all, so the 11.5%abv felt about right.
Drinkability – Overall, this was a really good beer.  Perhaps a little flat. 435 charactersFalcon91Wolvrn03, Mar 08, 2014

App- Looks pretty standard for a stout/darker old ale. Dark brown body, minimal head and retention.
Smell- Leather, dark fruits- such as figs, dates, raisins- caramel, toffee, smoke. Very complex. Lots of stuff going on. Don't get the apple that it says on the label.
Flavour- similar to the nose. More dark fruit forward, with a lot of sweet caramel and toffee. Oak barrels. Less smoke and leather than in the nose. 
Mouthfeel- Medium bodied, low carbonation that is still just about right, it would seem. Definitely a sipper; there is a lot going on in the palate and it's hard enough to split a 12oz bottle between 4 people.
Overall- Typical Hair of the Dog. Remarkably complex strong ale that gives you a lot to think about. Most certainly one of the better "strong ales" I've had. 887 charactersStevedore, Feb 28, 2014

A - A deep mahogany with red hues when the light hits. Slight brown head that thins out quickly. Not any noticeable lacing or legs.
S - Lots of rich and complex scents here. Heavy bourbon, molasses, smoke, maple, dark fruit, brown sugar.
T - Massive bourbon and smoke flavor. Then in comes smooth vanilla and rich, dark fruits. Rich chocolate tastes sweeps in as well. So rich and delicious.
M - Not much carbonation. Full body. Thick mouthfeel. Very rich and smooth.
O - So lucky I had a chance to enjoy this. Amazing beer that is exactly what I love in a beer. Rich and flavorful (vanilla, rich dark fruit, bourbon, brown sugar). Highlights the flavor of a bourbon-barrel aged beer without being harsh. One of my favorites so far on my journey of good beer.

Intimidating strong aroma suggests boozy syrup over dark bread with a touch of smoke.
Flavor largely follows. It is strong, sweet and syrupy.
Interesting for sure, but too extreme. More cordial than ale.

A: Pours a very dark brown with a little red highlight. Small light brown head, even with an aggressive pour. Surprisingly decent retention, despite the miniscule head. Just the smallest specks of lacing.
S: Whoa. Lots of barrel aging. Bourbon is strong in this one. Loaded with caramel and brown sugar. Quite a bit of smoke tries to compete with the bourbon too but compliments instead of overpowers. Sweet malts underneath further add to the decadence. Not overly boozy despite the 11.5% ABV and barrel aging. Very unique, strong and complex aroma.
T: Very strong and bold barrel flavors up front. I have to stop and carefully examine the flavors, this is so complex. There is heavy and smooth caramel and toasted sugars. Sweet dark fruits, raisin for sure but also quite a bit of apple - like apple brandy. Almost a caramel apple flavor at points. Lots of smoked malt too, not very acrid due to all the sweetness but it's more of a umami type flavor. Like burnt BBQ'd meat. Not overpowering but prominent and a key factor to balancing all of the sweetness. Belly warming from the alcohol but no stinging alcohol taste. A little charred oak in the aftertaste with light hints of smoke floating around between sips. Big syrupy caramel coats the mouth forever. 
M: Heavy, thick, sweet, borderline cloying.
O: Pretty serious brew. Super complex but nothing is overpowering. Garnering balance with this high ABV and multiple barrel agings is a rare thing but they pull it off pretty well. I'm not a fan of smoky beers but the huge sweetness and barrel aging has tempered the smoked malts quite well. Don't get me wrong, it's still smoky and meaty but it's tolerable for me. This one is very sweet, syrupy sweet and heavy. A sipper for sure. Dessert beer. Very unique. 1,797 charactersDope, Dec 04, 2013

Appearance: Deep murky brown. No head. Thin lacing. Super sticky alcohol legs. 
Smell: Fresh green apples, brown sugar, bourbon, oak. There an indescribable and very rich smell to this beer. 
Taste: Smoke, bourbon, oak, dark fruit and rich apple brandy. The very end of the tongue merges from rich sweet notes into a subtle dark chocolate bitterness. 
Mouthfeel: Full. 
Overall: The smoke and the apple brandy are the stars here and they play off each other extremely well. A very decadent and unique beer. 546 charactersBrandywine, Nov 19, 2013

12oz Tulip on tap at Hair of the Dog
A: Deep dark black with thin brown head
S: Bourbon, molasses, dark fruit and a slight hint of apple. Very rich.
T: You only need the smallest of sips to enjoy an absolute explosion of flavor from the beer. Huge bourbon, apple, sweet caramel and barrel backed by leather and smoke. It has that Hair of the Dog quality that most of their beers share, but Matt takes it to another level. One of, if not the best tasting beer I've ever had.
M: A crucial part to why I rate this beer so highly. This beer is very thick. It goes down incredibly smooth yet the carbonation gives it an interesting grittiness. Unbelievable.
O: This is a beer that I feel so incredibly fortunate to ever have to opportunity to drink. My highest rated beer thus far. It shares the amazing mellow, well balanced, alcohol hiding barrel aged qualities with the other heavy hitters such as BCBS but is far more flavorful, complex and unique in my opinion. 977 charactersanteater, Nov 10, 2013

2013:
Pours black with a quickly fading pale tan head. Wonderful flavors of dark fruit, smoked malt, and smooth bourbon. Everything blends together to make an extremely smooth, thick brew. Fantastic.
2010:
Similar pour, but the flavors are quite different. Strange umami and sweet flavors cover up the delicious bourbon and dark fruit. Not nearly as enjoyable.
2013 was the clear winner, thanks again to Chris and Jeff for putting this pair together. 529 charactersthebigredone, Nov 05, 2013

Pours a murky orange-brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Tiny dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is malt, smoke, and fruit aromas. Taste is much the same with slightly sour caramel and fruit flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of woody bitterness and an alcohol kick on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer with a very earthy and woody set of aromas and flavors. 612 charactersUCLABrewN84, Oct 28, 2013

Doesn't look very carbonated, but there are a few bubbles on the side of the glass. Sweet, bourbon, candy-like aromas. Some woody and apple notes are noticeable as well. Lots of complexity here. Smells absolutely delicious. First taste is insane. Feels thin and basically flat. Some heat is obvious, along with delicious bourbon and apple brandy barrel flavors. The finish is wood and smoke, but somehow in an incredible way for me. This beer is really throwing me for a loop, as it is unlike anything I've had before. But I am really enjoying it. This was my only bottle, but I will have to get more. This would age VERY well. Overall, Hair of the Dog has blown my mind yet again, this time with the most recent release of Matt.

4.4/5  rDev -0.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4.5Appearance- Guess what- no head. But this is no surprise. I don't really care if this is very carbonated; I simply hope there's a little bit. I'm guessing the head would have been a light beige but I really don't know. The body is an opaque dark chocolate black. There were a couple spots of lacing but not anymore. 
Nose- Very complex and quite compelling. Got lots of apple when I first opened this beer but now I'm getting a bunch of smoke, chocolate, tobacco, leather, and figs. All signs of a rich and distinguished strong ale. Molasses, slight bourbon, and honey with slight but beneficial heat. Lots of maple syrup. I'm guessing this was aged on eau du vie barrels. Cherries as well.
Taste- Lush chocolate opens up the flavor profile and moves into apple which is ousted by rich cherry, raisin, and brown sugar with bits of tobacco and leather. This tastes sort of what I imagine Westy 12 would if it lived up to many of the descriptions. Heavy bourbon that doesn't rely on clunky oak notes. Reminds me a lot of the first time I had Parabola. However, this beer lacks the smoothness and fullness of that beer. The only real negative is the mouthfeel. Berries show up as well. Tons of complexity but nothing that dominates or isolates itself. The most notes tend to cycle through and repeat themselves making it a different experience with each sip. Candied fruits. Lots of brown sugar, some maple syrup.
Mouthfeel- Between medium and heavy bodied but I wish it were fuller. Carbonation is pretty light to almost nonexistent. Not entirely bad though. Some grit.
Drinkability- Extremely easygoing but also complex and rich enough to comple paced sipping. This packs a lot of punch. Pricey enough that this might be a one time thing.
Overall- Definitely lives up to the hype. A little disappointed that I couldn't get bottles but still happy to be drinking this. Definitely worth 15 bucks, maybe even 20. 1,913 charactersartoolemomo, Oct 20, 2013

poured into HOD tulip
smell - sweet boozy magic
color - amber/copper and almost no lacing as this beer was not very carbonated
mouthfeel - thick as can be. could still taste the beer 1/2 hour after I left. coats the tongue and throat
taste - holy cow. did not expect to enjoy it this much. I knew I would like it because 99% of the beer they make is fantastic, but this immediately vaulted into my top 5. maybe it was the 3 years of aging, but this was just a masterpiece of what a barrel aged strong ale can be. sweet but not too sweet. Boozy, but not over the top. almost tastes like some sort of sweet liqure blended with the malt and hops of a beer. just nothing like it. The Cherry Adam from the wood had similar qualities, but this beer did it without any added fruit. I now see why people were lined up to buy cases of the 2013 batch. 879 charactersderftron, Oct 14, 2013

My first sample of Matt comes courtesy of d0b, thanks Dave! Matt gurgles from the bottle like black coffee and looks no different when in the glass. A small, short lived beige head settles to a swirling a nice collar. Sticky sheet lacing gets left behind after each drink which is very impressive for such a big beer.
The nose is all kinds of deep and expressive. Molasses, apple brandy, bourbon barrel, and tendrils of dense smoke all float through the air. Richly caramelized sugar lays down a strong backbone. A thick roastiness and deep, dark chocolate make an appearance too. The aroma on this beer is so deep and complex my ramblings barely scratch the surface. 
The flavor profile is also off the charts complex. All the complexities of the nose are present in the flavor but there's also a solid amount of roasty coffee bitterness and the smoke just coats my palate. The apple brandy aspect hits on the swallow and adds a crazy touch of sweetness. Black cherries hit on the backend too, damn, crazy. All I mentioned in the nose seems to really pop on the tongue. This beer reminds me a lot of Adam, which is one of my favorites, and actually improves upon it.
The mouthfeel is so velvety smooth it boggles my mind. The smokiness coats the tongue and the finish is never ending. The body is rich and heavy but in no way cloying and the carbonation is on the lighter side allowing this beast to work through on its own.
Matt is without a doubt a sipping beverage. There's a lot of huge flavor and it takes some time to pick out all the complexity. Take your time and sit down with this beer over an hour or so, you will be rewarded.
Hair of the Dog makes some great beer and this very well could be their best. It's so rich, fruity, smokey and delicious that I can't stop thinking about it. If you get any chance to give this beer a try, trade, steal, or cheat to get it. Thanks again, Dave! 1,915 charactersjoe1510, Aug 19, 2013

Pours deep brown with only a thin ring of beige head. Aroma has lots of caramel, brown sugar, cherries, green apple, vanilla, oak, some deep roast and some booze.
Taste is initially sweet and boozy, but the complexity eventually comes through. Lots of brown sugar, raisin and fig, cherries, tart apples, vanilla and oak. The bourbon presence is really complementary and doesn't dominate at all. A bit of noticeable alcohol, but relatively mild. A bit warming on the finish.
Very smooth mouthfeel, and somewhat sticky sweet. A little bit of bitterness on the finish prevents the sweetness from getting out of hand. A warm finish.
As far as big, sweeter boozy beers go, this is one of the best I've had. Very complex and enjoyable. As it warms, the apple really comes through. 798 characterswarnerry, Jul 06, 2013

4.57/5  rDev +3.4%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Super-huge thanks to Jeff for opening this one; this has been a HUGE want of mine for a while now. 2010 vintage. Matt pours out of the bottle looking thick and viscous; a dark mix of brown and almost-black edges. Even a rough pour produces nearly no head, just a thin, tan ring that hugs the glass before vanishing forever, leaving the top of the brew bare.
I could smell Matt as soon as we cracked open the bottle. Once we finally poured it into our glasses, the aroma filled the room. You could smell it without even leaning in towards the beer. And warmth only aided in the robustness, drawing out even more flavors, more power, and more depth. It was absolutely incredible.
I'll try to do this beer justice by listing out some of the many things noted in the insanely complex aroma. Black cherries, figs, oak, vanilla, bourbon, tart apples, brown sugar, toffee, plums, tobacco, mild char and smoke, and some underlying sweetness throughout. Just amazing, seriously. Each successive whiff brings out new nuances you weren't getting before. One of the best things I've smelled in a while.
Like many Hair of the Dog brews, the taste contains a commanding alcohol warmth up front; just to let you know that it's not messing around here. Big, boozy apples up front with a compelling combo of boozy-warm and lightly-tart. The fruit character is actually pretty huge and contains more than just apple; cherry, grape, plum, and sugary dates also make an appearance.
The initial, mild tartness from the fruits quickly fades into the boozy abyss as the malts rumble in and unleash the sweetness. Toffee, caramel, brown sugar, heavy flavors of wood and dry oak, sherry, and Hair of the Dog's signature tobacco/leather finish. Make no mistake about it, this beer is HUGE. It's robust, commanding, and a slow sipper if there ever was one, even at "only" 11.5% ABV.
Matt's presence on my palate is also huge; thick, chewy, viscous, oily, and sticky, and you'll be tasting Matt long after you've swallowed. Left over oak, booze, and fading dark fruits will coat your mouth for days if you forget to brush. Just an incredible beer when all was said and done. I can't thank Jeff enough for cracking this one. If I ever had the chance, I'd buy as much of this as I could afford. 2,269 characterstectactoe, Jun 28, 2013

Pours black with ruby highlights and a very thin brown head
Smell is out of this world. Powerful notes of molasses, vanilla, soy, bourbon, brown sugar, faint smoke, cola, dark fruit, sweet liqueur.
Taste is right on par with the smell. More brown sugar, rum soaked raisins, licorice, bourbon, char, oak. Very sweet but still balanced. No alcohol evident.
Mouthfeel is sticky and viscous without being creamy, lower carb. Just where you'd want it for this beer.
Perhaps the most complex beer I've ever tasted, and absolutely one of the best. 578 charactersMasterCraft, Apr 01, 2013

We had both the original Bottleworks 10 bottling (which was pretty obviously past its prime) and a bottling from November 2010 which was better. Ratings are from the latter, but I'm posting both reviews here.
11/2010 Matt
Dark raisiny brown, only light carbonation visible. 6/10
Smells of sweet and slightly smoky malt, hints of chocolate and caramel. 7/10
Taste is sweet sugar and vanilla up front, some light sweet chocolate, mild smokiness, decent amount of booze, very tasty. 8/10
Carbonation is pretty good, nice thick semi-syrupy body, solid mouthfeel for the style. 7.5/10
This is a really solid, fairly interesting strong ale, but a little disappointing given the generally high regard for this beer. Maybe I would think more highly of a fresh bottle. 7.5/10
7.8/10
Bottleworks 10 Matt
Looks basically same as 2010. 6/10
Smell is sugary sweet vanilla, caramel and raisins. 8.5/10
Taste is woody, sugary sweet, vanilla, a bit smoky, still fairly boozy actually. Tastes pretty old but still good. 7.5/10
Mouthfeel is pretty flat and feels oxidized. Not great. 5/10
Still pretty durn tasty, but clearly past its prime. Smells considerably better than the more recent bottle, but definitely not as good overall.

A - No head. None. Pours dark purple/black. Pretty much opaque. No lacing. I can't quite decide whether it looks terrible or strangely great. I'll hedge it towards great.
S - wow... Interesting. There is a lot of booze, the apple brandy barrel is there with lots of wood and apple sauce. There is some smokiness in the background. A bunch of stuff that I can't really describe.
T - most interesting and assertive beer I've ever tasted. Super aggressive flavor of oak, and the apple brandy. Almost peaty smoke element is there throughout and really hangs on in the aftertaste. There is some sweet molasses flavor on the edge. A sort of an indescribable overtone that I can best describe as the taste equivalent of the way an expensive dark cigar smells. It's not easy drinking, but its very good.
M - rich medium feel and low carb.
O - This definitely holds the spot as most complex and interesting beer I've had. Would want to drink it all the often, but would certainly have it again. HotD talks about making old styles of ales and this one exemplifies that. Matt really does taste like an antique beer. Amazing work of creating complexity and depth in a beer. 1,179 charactersBeerandboards, Mar 13, 2013

Score: 97
2010 vintage bottle served in an Upland snifter glass and enjoyed on 05/10/13.
Appearance: Pours an ink black color with minimal light khaki head that settles to a ring-around-the-glass. Not much head off the pour at all, but the ring-around-the-glass lacing does not dissipate. Below average lacing, but good retention of what little lacing is left behind. 4.25/5
Smell: Molasses/syrup, tobacco and faint smoke. Decadent dark chocolate notes behind the syrup. Some dark fruit and a hint of jammy cherry. There's a similar aroma quality that I liken to the Cigar City Imperial Sweet Stout as well that I cannot quite describe. Vanilla, oak and a hint of soy sauce round out the nose. Incredible complex. 4.75/5
Taste: Syrup, fig, raisin, vanilla and charred chocolate all wildly hit the palate at first sip. There's a ton going on at once, and it's all well integrated. A subtle and complementary smokiness is present, akin to the smokiness present in Hair of the Dog's Adam; it is not at all a "forward" quality on the palate. Tobacco, brown sugar, plum spirit, bourbon and vanilla in the finish. As it warms up and layers, there's a cherry comes out in the finish too. There's a nice alcohol warmth, but this is not a boozy beer. Burnt brown sugar, licorice and tobacco linger in the aftertaste. There's a touch of soy too, but it works well with the flavor profile of the beer. The flavors here are big, bold and balanced; each sip layering in complexity and accentuating different qualities. 4.75/5
Mouthfeel: Full bodied, syrupy. Very low carbonation -- almost undercarbonated, but not quite. Slightly sweet overall. 4.25/5
Overall: This is one of the absolute best strong ales that I have ever enjoyed. It is a monster beer that is jam packed with bold, complex flavors. I love the mix of tobacco, smoke, syrup and dark fruit in this brew. I cannot wait for Hair of the Dog to re-release this one; I'll need a case!
Cost: $15 for a 12 oz bottle. 2,046 charactersjegross2, Feb 08, 2013

2010 Vintage poured in to tulip.
A - Poured dark black with a thin layer of light brown head that immediately receded to a ring around the glass.
S - A big sweetness up front with chocolate, vanilla, woody notes and roast. There are some lighter bourbon and vanilla notes present as well.
T - A massively bold palate that features cocoa, roast, smoke and toasted woodiness. There is a big overall sweetness that is nicely cut by a warming alcohol presence. Secondary flavours include dark fruit, molasses, apple and pear. As the beer warms up the dark fruit becomes more prominent, creating a chocolate covered cherry flavour. 
M - Medium, almost full body. Some stickiness. Light carbonation. 
O - This was an absolutely amazing beer and another home run from HOTD. 811 charactersTheSevenDuffs, Jan 30, 2013

A- Pours a murky brown with a thin off white head that leaving minimal lacing. Like most HotD brews, this isn't the prettiest girl at the ball.
S- Amazingly complex with notes of dark chocolate, camp fire, slightly unripened apples, roasted malt, peat, caramel, burnt sugar, bourbon and a hint of soy.
T- The taste follows the aroma with a great deal of complexity without any flavor being dominant. Plenty of earthiness with smoke, wood and peat followed by burnt sugar, apples, leather, roasted malt, bourbon, caramel, soy sauce, and some booze. 
M- Light carbonation with a thick and full mouthfeel. Some heat at the finish.

A: Black like charred ash. A thin creme lacing and sticky, sticky legs.
N: Deep inhalations of smoke and apple brandy. Chocolate and leather drift in and out between the charred oak. There's deep vanilla here and caramel. Rich and inviting. 
T: Smoke, candi sugar, and malt. Bourbon and oak notes overlap with the apple brandy depth. A second layer of chocolate and leather. This is absolutely superb. 
M: A hefty body with a completely shocking lack of alcohol. This is carbonated, if barely. Lingers. 
O: A complete tour de force. The 2010 is the superior vintage, by far, in my estimation, and this is drinking quite well at 2 years old. Glad I have more.
Edit: After having this one on tap for the 2013 vintage, I have come to the conclusion that this is my favorite beer right now and deserves a bump accordingly. 915 charactersSarlacc83, Jan 01, 2013
4.71/5  rDev +6.6%look: 3 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5The 2010 vintage pours with light carbonation into a murky deep coffee-brown body. There's very little head, but a pale ring of lacing. What is remarkable about this beer is how the elements of taste surge and fade like voices in counterpoint. Smells of sweet bourbon and light raisins greet the nose and they linger over dried apple and smoke. The taste comes and goes: a sharp dried apple sweetness, a slight alcoholic edge that pervades, a deeper sweetness of molasses and milk chocolate, smoke and charred oak, finishing on a quiet chocolate astringency. The body is medium to thick, the beer is sweet, not cloying, and in the delicate interplay of powerful flavours is one remarkable beer. 694 characterscmadd, Dec 30, 2012

A. Deep dark brown in the glass with absolutely no head. No carbonation at all, gotta be honest, doesn't look all too amazing
S. Big sweet green apple dominates the nose. Smoke follows along with molasses, a tiny roast and chocolate. Smells really nice and different. 
T. Apple is toned down big tone from the nose. Sweeter, well incorporated alcohol like bourbon and brandy? Milk chocolate is there as well as sweet green apple, there's a ton going on here. A tiny bit of vanilla works its way in as well as a tiny alcohol sting. Really tasty stuff.
M. Flat as flat can be but isnt a deal breaker by any means. Body is on the lighter side of heavy and feels really nice. This beer feels much better with no carbonation than it would if it was over carbonated.
O. Really really nice stuff. The nose and flavor are so unique and come through nicely. Definitely a nice brew that I'm extremely glad I had the opportunity to try! 1,029 charactersGushue3, Dec 07, 2012

poured into HotD Tulip glass.
Appearance: black bodied beer with thin cap of tan colored head. Slowely drops down to no head 3.0
Smell: chocolately, green apples, and apple brandy. Little bit of meaty smoke and more granny smith apples. Molasses brown sugar and candied sugar. Really sweet dessert beer thats very complex. 4.5
Taste: Tastes just like the nose. Chocolately and apple brandy. Little bit of meaty/bacony smoke and some char. Tobacco, molasses, brown sugar and candied sugar. 4.5 
Mouthfeel: medium bodied beer with low carbonation. Not boozey. 4.5
Overall: I think that I like Matt better with some time on it. Should bring down the level of swetness found in this beer when fresh. This will age well just like the previous batch of Matt. 4.75

Appearance: dark black bodied beer with a few small bubbles on the side of the glass. No head at all. 3.0
Smell: oak, bourbon, chocolate, smoke, fruity, splash of soy sauce. It smells fairly boozey as well. 4.5
Taste: Oaky, bourbony, vanilla, and brown sugar sweetness upfront. Meaty / "baconesk" smoke, green apples, tobacco, leather, figs, and molasses are all over in the middle of this beer. A subtle hint of soy sauce in the finish with some sweet chocolates. Great complexity in this beer. This beer is just tasty! 4.75

4.62/5  rDev +4.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5My name is Matt, and I planned a while ago to crack one of these bottles of Matt open on my 26th birthday, which happens to be today. Shared in company of good friends. Served chilled, but not cold.
A- Pours dark brown, stout-like in color but not as thick. Pretty flat, minimal carbonation. The cap didn't even make a noise when I opened it. Looks a lot like King Henry to be honest, with a lot less carbonation.
S- Smells a lot like a barrel-aged barleywine because of the bourbon and vanilla characteristics, coupled with the hint of alcohol on the nose. Definitely some malt in there, very sweet smell. I'd say there's a hint of chocolate in the aroma, but mostly just that typical aroma from barrel-aging.
T- On the initial sip I got some normal tastes that I'd expect out of a stout...vanilla, bourbon, that good stuff. But there was a bit of a bite to it. This beer completely changed as it warmed up, for the better. There is definitely a chocolate taste to it at first, and lots of bourbon. Very sweet taste. But the aftertaste is the best part of this beer. There's a slight hint of apple from the sweetness which was really what I was looking for, but there's this big leathery, smokiness that lingers after you swallow that's just incredible. I hate smoky beers, but this isn't smoky like a smoked stout would be. It's much more of a leather kind of quality, almost like tobacco if that makes any sense.
M- This mouthfeel would be unimpressive in other beers but it was perfect in Matt. Thick enough but not chewy, and doesn't get in the way of the awesome flavors.
O- I waited a while to drink this and I'm happy I did. It was everything I expected it to be, and it's definitely the best HotD beer I've had so far...but I have yet to open my bottle of Adam FTW. Either way, I'm thrilled to have another bottle and to see what happens to this with some more age. Next time I'm drinking this cellar temp though, no reason at all to chill it. Great stuff by HotD, this is worth the hype. 2,002 charactersmgp2675, Oct 29, 2012

S - Aroma is a mix of sweet caramel and smoked malts with dark fruit, candi sugar, vanilla, oak, Bourbon, apples, and some booze.
T - Starts off with toffee malts, candi sugars, and some dark fruits with some vanilla and apple. Through the middle, the oak and bourbon come through with some good smokiness and a touch of almost molasses. The finish is a mix of candi sugars, dark fruit, smoke, oak, vanilla Bourbon, apple, and a bit of booze.
M - Full bodied with mild carbonation. Feels smooth with a smokey, sweet, and warming finish.
D - Very drinkable. Really nicely balanced with lots of complex flavors coming together. The smoked malts are a nice touch. 808 charactersngeunit1, Oct 20, 2012

Bottleworks X edition (2009)
Thanks to Lurchingbeast for this this one. 
Appearance: Matt pours out a very dark brown, with a back light revealing a beautiful deep red along the edges. A rough pour yields a thin off-white head that lasts reasonably well and a swirl coats the glass in heavy alcohol legs. 
Smell: Mmmmm, another delicious smelling beer from HotD and potentially the most complex to date. Big dark fruit notes (stewed plums, red grapes, raisins and fig jam) dominate the nose, with molasses, dark brown sugar and liquorice also well noted. Other notes include: Earthy tobacco, dark rum and a little campfire smoke. As the beer warms the apple eau de vie becomes apparent and the smokiness and fig character increase. 
Taste: Interestingly there is a distinct bourbon character in the flavour, but the apple eau de vie from the nose is absent. Other notes include: Dark fruits (fig in particular), dark treacle, molasses, brown sugar, a touch of liquorice, a little chocolate, oak and an earthy quality. The finish displays a distinct smokey note and is quite dry. 
Mouthfeel: Full bodied and lightly sticky with a low (read perfect) level of super smooth carbonation. 
Overall: Another winner from HotD - I have yet to have anything other than world class beers from this brewery! I will most certainly be getting some more bottles of Matt when a fresh batch is released. 1,470 charactersThehuntmaster, Oct 08, 2012

a - looks pretty bada$$...dark purple with a thin creamy head.
s - super smokey. some raisin and bourbony wood. apples and dark fruit.
t - raisin, dark fruit, some soy sauce. lots of heat from the bourbon. some smoke, not as much as the nose suggested. really tasty...great fruity presence.
m - has a bit of a burn. some good heat. strong ale indeed. full bodied and thick, but oh so enjoyable.
o - REALLY awesome. I dig this A LOT. probably my favorite of the night. smoke is really present in the nose, but that's it...a bit in the taste, but it works well. it is part of the barrel. would definitely have this again and seek it out. 792 characterscosmicevan, Aug 28, 2012

4.69/5  rDev +6.1%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5This has been one of my top wants for some time. My name's Matt, and I love barrel-aged barleywine-ish beers. So I chose to use this one to celebrate my birthday. 2010 vintage. Enjoyed 3 August 2012, reviewed from notes.
Pours a murky slightly-reddish dark brown. Thin layer of yellowish head. Not much lacing, but tons of bubbles sticking to the inside of the glass. Not winning on appearance, though.
I smell it, and I immediately know it's going to be good. Has a little bit of apple, but mostly it's that rich sweet bourbon barrel aroma. All the positive character of the barrel, without the alcohol bite. Dark fruits (plums and prunes), shaded with lighter pulpy fruit (apple).
Taste is heavy on the toffee. Rich mash of whiskey, some smoke, brown sugar accents. Rich, sweet, and oh so indescribably tasty. Reminds me a lot of a barrel-aged English barleywine, with the sweetness and barrel flavors. At times it's like drinking candy. Alcohol is very well masked - I could have believed this was around 7% ABV, not 11.5%.
Mouthfeel is heavy, chewy, and so sticky that I can still feel it on my lips well after finishing the glass. Carbonation is relatively low, but that's to be expected. Finish is long-lasting, with all those lovely flavors persisting and making me wish I had more.
Among the best beers I've had. Really really tasty stuff. If I could make a fruit-whiskey jolly rancher, this is what it would taste like. It pleases me greatly that my namesake beer is so damn good. 1,494 characterszeledonia, Aug 17, 2012

Pours a murky dark brown color, super opaque, no head, no lacing. The beer looks thick and syrupy in the glass, very inviting, but looks to be a sipper. The aroma is intriguing, bourbon, lots of smokey malt, tart apples, chocolate and some malty sweetness. The flavors are great, complex and hearty. Bourbon, smokiness, leather, tobacco and tart apples with other dark fruits and malty graininess with just a hint of astringent alcohol. The body is super thick and syrupy, almost no carbonation, but just enough to prop this beer up. 
Verdict: Definitely a sipper, unique blend of flavors between the smokiness and fruitiness, bourbon and the malt. A great brew that everyone should get to try once. 761 characterskevanb, Jul 29, 2012

Leathery, boozy, tobacco-y, smokey malt aroma and flavors dance around my senses at every sip & whiff. Black licorice and molasses impart even more darkness as I swish in my mouth. Boozy warmth throughout, creating an intense, bold flavor profile. So creative, so complex. And not for the faint of heart :) 459 charactersbrystmar, Jul 28, 2012

2010 vintage. At the HotD pub. Tulip.
A: Pours a deep, reddish-tinted brown, largely opaque. No head or lacing but some miniscule bubbles peak up right after the pour.
S: Bourbon, oak, apple and dark fruit, some smoke. Great balance: nothing overpowers, and oak influence is restrained so that the base beer shows through.
T: Again, bourbon and oak, dark fruit and a dose of cocoa, apple peaks through towards the finish, which is slightly boozy. Slight sweetness but finishes mostly dry.
M: A syrupy, sticky full body with just a tinge of carbonation.
O: Delicious and wonderful balance between the elements. Definite sipper. Could use a tad more carbonation, which along with the booziness knocks this a few points, but delicious nonetheless. 770 characterspmarlowe, Jul 16, 2012

4.97/5  rDev +12.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 52010 bottle (2 years old), tried at the Tasting Room in Portland, OR.
Pours an oily black colour, with a noticeably deep hazy that prevents the insertion of light. Insanely deep and thick body forms the most static carbonation I've ever seen. The only drawback is the head, which is a tiny ring of white bubbles around the edge. To be honest, it's understandable for the age of the beer.
Nose is insane. Big booziness comes through strongly, but everything is coupled with complex intense characters. Oak and bourbon provides the basis of the intensity, but smoother vanilla sweetness provides a basis. And it's gorgeous. Characters of red wine and applewood incense pop through as well, layering flavours atop flavours. Unbelievable stuff.
Palate is no less incredible: front betrays pepper and leather notes, before sweet port and oaken vanilla notes come through. The mid-palate shows a smooth complexity: more vanilla, darker notes and a hint more spice, before the finish comes rounding out. Here we get notes of sweet pepper, capsicum, red wine, pepper, berries and dust. Feel is rich, sweet and boozy. Incredible.
The aftertaste lingers for so long, so rich, and complex. I'm sure I'll still be tasting this on my grave.
This is an absolutely insanely good beer. The level of complexity is mind-boggling. It's almost overwhelming. Smooth, delectable and incredibly complex—genuinely one of the best beers I've ever had. 1,433 characterslacqueredmouse, Jul 08, 2012

a - Pours a brown, almost black color, with less than one inch of tan head and low carbonation evident. Almost flat.
s - Smells of roasted malts, licorice, bourbon, sweet dark fruits, plums, figs, raisins, and oak. Very interesting, but very nice mix of bourbon and licorice.
t - Tastes of bourbon, licorice, roasted malts, bourbon, oak, and light smoke. Nice, though I like nose better.
m - Medium body and low carbonation, with a very smooth body.
o - Overall I liked this one a lot, though it is very different. I preferred Cherry AtfW, AftW, and FftW, but this is still a great beer I'd like to have again. 732 charactersmdfb79, Jun 27, 2012
4.76/5  rDev +7.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Yet another enormous thanks to Greg for this. 3 oz. poured into a FFF Teku on June 9th, 2012. 
A - Pours quite flat ala cherry Adam FtW without the red hues, dark brown coloring is akin to regular Adam.
S - This is a bit mellow initially. Predominantly bourbon barrel in the nose, lesser dark fruit, a touch of brandy, candied sugar. After a strong swirl near room temp you can pull a bit of the sweet apple cider note and get a pretty unique mix. 
T - Front to mid palate is old ale, Adam-like with roasted malt grains, light espresso, dark chocolate, and caramel. Mid to rear is rather amazing bourbon barrel toasted oak that transitions into an undeniable apple eu di vie barrel quality. The backend apple is more like a golden apple variant, it's more hearty and not really tart. The dark chocolate pushes through the full palate to a lingering bitter aftertaste.
M - Medium body, low carbonation almost identical to Adam FtW, great finish of brandy barrel and oak tannins.
D - Stellar stuff, one of the greatest back palate finishes I can remember. Great barrel combination that makes this memorable and worthwhile.
Edit - I was fortunate enough to revisit this in the form of the new 2013 release. I must applaud Allan, this is absolutely the same stellar brew and merits a slight increase in the ratings for consistency. 1,333 charactersAuracom, Jun 11, 2012

Matt pours a medium bodied, sticky dark dark molasses brown in color with no head, just light beige bubbles. The nose on this one is complex and smells like something I've had before but can't out my finger on. It features sweet malt, molasses, maple syrup, leather, tobacco, figs, oak, and light smoke. The flavors are almost identical. It's slightly dry so I get plenty of spicy tobacco and oak up front. It's followed by figs, plum, and raisin. It just has this earthiness about it. I really dig it. It drinks like an old ale and doesn't feature any alcohol at all. It drinks medium in body and coats your palate. It's really enjoyable. This beer is great so I hope it isn't too difficult to chase down. 759 charactersaasher, Jun 10, 2012

A- Pours a deep, dark brown with no head, even after an aggressive pour. Some stray bubbles float around the edge of the glass but that's it. Nothing really in terms of lacing.
S- Where do I begin? Notes of molasses, leather and tobacco, which I would expect since the base beer is Adam. The aroma begins to become a little sweet from the apple brandy, candied sugar and honey. But everything is balanced out by the big smoky backbone. I also detect notes of dark fruits and oak. I'm a little disappointed that I'm not picking up much of the bourbon.
T- Big smokiness hits the palate. It's like a smoked meat kind of smokiness. Leather, roasted malts, dark fruits, apple and just the slightest bit of vanilla. Again, it starts to become too sweet but the smokiness does not let it become so. Velvety chocolate coats the back of my throat and lingers just for a second or two. Still not much bourbon. Based on the reviews, the bourbon should be more than noticeable.
M- Full, rich body with only trace amounts of carbonation. Somewhat creamy. The beer coats my entire mouth but falls just short of being syrupy. You can feel the alcohol's presence but it's not overwhelming. 
O- Really a standout beer. Complex, layered and blended nicely. I would have given it a higher rating if there was a little more carbonation. I was a little disappointed with the lack of bourbon I was able to pull out of this beer. Overall though, a definite must try. 1,508 charactersMahlik, Jun 02, 2012

A. Deep, dark tobacco juice brown. Very loose, faint ring of cream colored bubbles around the neck and that's about it. Some extremely light lacing, but decent oily legs. 
S. My goodness, there's a lot going on here. Molasses, rotten fruit, bootstrap leather, tobacco, baking chocolate, honey, hints of smoke, vanilla, plum. One of the most complex bouquets I have experienced. Definitely in the Old Ale/Strong Ale vein, with lots of overripe fruit and malt notes. This is excellent.
T. Brown sugar, molasses, some earthy hop notes, chocolate, vanilla, caramel, tobacco, leather. Follows the nose almost exactly. Has a very nutty flavor overall, with thick, cloying sweetness and a coffee-tobacco finish. I'm not sure I've ever had anything quite like it. It's extreme in the sense that there is so much going on here, but everytime I feel like this is about to go off a cliff, it surprises me by reeling it back in and finding a nice balance. It's decadent, lighly hoppy, extremely malty, and very sweet. The finish is almost like a good cigar. Wow.
M. Full bodied, sticky sweet, and very lightly carbonated. Suits the style.
O. A fascinating beer and one-of-a-kind experience. It's quite likely I'll never quite find a beer like it. The number of flavors this thing presents is incredible, and it strikes a surprisingly impressive balance between all of them. Hop, malt, booze all get their turn here, and all add up to a very impressive concoction. Definitely over-the-top sticky and cloying, so beware of that, but the sheer breadth of diversity in the flavor profile in this is awesome. Not a perfect beer, but extremely daring and the results speak for themselves. Great job, HotD! 1,784 characterssiege06nd, Jun 02, 2012

Taste - Sweet caramel, apple, and again coca-cola. Leathery, but not enough to balance out the sweetness. Licorice. I get a lot of the Eau de Vie, but not a lot of the bourbon barrel in the taste. Very sweet.
Mouthfeel - Flat as hell, which I already said. Thick and syrupy. Sweet. Everything that makes it tough to drink.
Overall - It's a fascinating beer. I honestly don't know how much I like it. The flavors are amazing, although I don't know how well they go together. Unique enough to really impress me, though. 880 charactersAlieniloquium, Apr 05, 2012
4.39/5  rDev -0.7%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.52010 vintage poured into glass. Ticking a longtime major want, thanks Kundog. 
Color is dark cola with a thin ring of tan head. More than I was expecting based on other reviews I read. 
Smells of raisins, apples and molasses. Brandy is the prominent spirit, and I don't get much bourbon. 
Sweet raisins up front with some apple on the finish. Ends with some booziness but no burn. 
Thick, smooth mouthfeel, and again some heat on the end
Overall, another solid effort from HOTD; they tend to produce beers over and over right up my alley. Looking forward to my Adam from the Wood patiently tucked away in my cellar. 620 charactersCruisaC, Mar 31, 2012

The aroma shows some dark fruits to it with notes of raisin and cherries coming out. The candi sugar is pretty noticeable as well with a sugary, almost candy like presence to it. From the barrel aging I get more of a brown sugar flavor with some slight bourbon and vanilla notes. I get a little bit of a leathery, slight tobacco like flavor to it as well. Lots of flavors going on in it. It was pretty good, but felt a little overly sweet with the candi sugar and dark fruit maltiness combination at times. I really liked the depth to it though and as it warmed I get less candi sugar and more bourbon to it, which bumped it up from a 4 to a 4.5 for me. 
The taste shows a lot of the sweeter, dark fruit flavors up front. Cherry, raisin and fig flavors really stand out in it. Towards the finish I get a hint of the smoked malt mixing with some very good brown sugar and smooth bourbon flavors. I get some bitterness in the finish as well that really helps balance out all the sweet maltiness.
The mouthfeel is a little above medium bodied, but lighter then it looked. Carbonation is low. Overall it was a really good beer. It felt a little overly sweet with the candi sugar at first, as it warmed though things really started coming together. The finish is where things really stood out for me in it, the barrel aging, slight smoked malt and balancing bitterness really worked together well. 1,591 charactersbillab914, Feb 26, 2012

I am enjoying this bottle on my son Matt's first birthday. I started looking for this bottle in October and Aaron came through big time. I poured the 12oz bottle into my DFH snifter to find a nice dark, deep, brown body. I had no head and no carbonation. 
The aroma was complex, the dried fruits really stood out on this one, also with some bourbon, vanilla, caramel, and plums. A great smelling beer.
The taste was as complex as the nose, and was just exceptional. The great thing about this beer is the balance. With so much going on one flavor doesn't dominate the rest, you can really taste the bourbon, dried fruits, caramel, vanilla, etc. 
This was a smooth, smooth beer to drink. The carbonation was extremely light. This one is defiantly one to take on slowly and enjoy sip by sip. 889 charactersDan3279, Feb 16, 2012

A - Bottle opens with a very mild pop...pours into the glass a rather dark brown color with traces of amber when held to the light. Looks to be nearly still in the glass...not a trace of head forms...appears on the thick and syrupy side.
S - Quite sweet on the nose, syrupy and buttery toffee, caramel and molasses, marshmallows...big shot of straight booze, sweet vanilla, dark fruits, brandy.
T - Yep, super sweet almost coating the lips in various sugars - honey, toffee, caramel, simple syrup. Smokey malt creeps in to the sweetness giving a little bit of balance to this. Lightly hoppy bittered but doesn't really stand up to the sugars in here. There is a mild touch of alcohol warmth that doesn't match the intensity found in the aroma. For 11.5% it is hidden quite well. The sweetness is unstoppable...this really is a bit much for me. I've had some unfermented worts that weren't this sweet.
M - Pretty much completely still. Thinner than I would expect, but manages to be about medium in body. Mt teeth hurt from the intense sugars here. Smokey aspects round out the finish behind all of the big malty sweet flavors, but really come far from what I'd call balance.
O - Well, I know I'm really supposed to like this beer a lot, but it just doesn't work for me. This is as slow a sipper as there can be. This would work much better in a small, small serving. It is fairly complex with a host of sugary sweet flavors to it, but it is just too overpowering for its own good. I'm getting thru the bottle but it is slow going. I would not call this one of my favorite American Strong Ales. 1,657 charactersportia99, Jan 29, 2012

Poured from the bottle into a few taster glasses. Color was the darkest of browns, maroon around the edges, opaque, no head to speak of, although light swirling produced a tiny bit of unexpected lacing. Nice aroma, indicative of the complexity that I'd soon be tasting: dark fruits and lots of them, booze, wood, esters, thick dark malts. Lots of sumptuous dark fruit in the taste--raisins, prunes, figs--no disguising the booze, smooth chocolate (lingered into the aftertaste), with hints of smoke and herbal hops. All things considered, the mouthfeel was amazingly smooth and velvety; obviously you want to let this one sit on the palate and get the full gambit of flavors from it. Very nice, and very savorable. I have a couple extra bottles of this that I'm going to let age for a while. Should be interesting to see how they taste in a few years, but they're obviously ready for consumption now. 999 charactersRifugium, Jan 28, 2012

Small bit of foam with a small collar. 
Very dark body with a slight bit of deep dark red showing around the edges. A wee bit of lacing. 
Smells of apples, oak barrel, chocolate and a touch of smoke. 
Chocolate first and foremost with some smoke and oak barrel. Apple isn't too noticeable on palate like it was in the nose. 
Very little bitterness. Real smooth. No sign at all of the 11.5%. 
Slick mouthfeel. Could use a touch more carbonation. Full bodied. Zero burn from alcohol. 
Flavors are a bit muted so I suspect this is a bit past it's prime. Would love to get a bottle from the newer batch to compare.  653 charactershansgruber, Jan 19, 2012

From a bottle into a snifter. 
Vintage: 2010 
APPEARANCE: Pours a small, medium looking, light tan head with good retention. Bistre brown in color with medium carbonation evident. Head slowly fades to a wisp and solid ring, both of which remain for the whole ride but leave no lacing down the glass. 
SMELL: Big bourbon nose off the pour. Bourbon, oak, vanilla and some smoked meat in there as well. Notes of roasted malts, coffee and chocolate notes, but the bourbon and smoked malts are more prominent. Complex stuff. 
TASTE: Bourbon up front, with oak and vanilla notes, as well as some roasted and smoky notes from the base beer. Some bitter chocolate, coffee, and some smoked meat accompany the barrel at the swallow, with touches of sweet apple coming through at the finish. Bold and lingering aftertaste of barrel flavors, bitter chocolate and hints of smoked meat. This is phenomenal. Very complex, tasty, and the barrel adds to the brew as opposed to dominating it. Just awesome.
PALATE: Medium body and medium carbonation. Creamy enough on the palate, goes down fine and finishes somewhat mouth-coating. Some heat lingers as well. Solid. 
OVERALL: This is a great of example of barrel aging done right! The base beer is complex and interesting, and the barrel aging is done just long enough to add complexity to the base beer instead of dominating it. Phenomenally complex and enjoyable; I hope to run into it again. Along with Adam and Fred, this one is another stellar brew from Hair of the Dog. A limited release definitely worth tracking down. Thanks again for the trade boatshoes. Highly recommended. 1,697 charactersJeffo, Jan 09, 2012

The beer pours at dark brown hue with very little head or lacing evidence. Really no lacing at all on the glass even with a swirl, appears more like a spirit than anything else. 
The aroma is huge, it has lots of bourbon and brandy notes but also a roasted character like a stout also with some chocolate and a touch of dark fruit and alcohol ethanol sweetness. This reminds a lot of parabola in the nose, it has a bacon like tinged roast stout with bourbon feel to it. Wow it's huge and hopefully is a prelude to a great taste to come. 
The taste also has plenty of prune and smoke in the taste, lots of candied dark fruit and then a little touch of spirit as well. Surprisingly, it's not hot and feels smooth though pretty complex over the palate. Really it seems like maybe they had aged this in a single malt barrel with all the peat notes in the beer, it has a nice earthiness to it too though I guess it makes sense with the smoked malts. Some caramel definitely comes through as well. 
Overall this beer and parabola really remind me of each other. Both great, lots of smoky notes and some kings of spirits but not too much. Nice stuff. 1,202 charactersDreadnaught33, Jan 08, 2012

Pours a cloudy dark brown with a minimal white head. Smell is a fantastic mix of bourbon, brandy and chocolate with hints of alcohol and dark fruits. Taste follows the smell - the brandy and bourbon come together perfectly and combines with a bit of roasted malt and a bit of smoke. It's sweet, but not overwhelmingly so. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with minimal carbonation. Overall, this is really a great beer that doesn't really taste like anything else out there. Probably my favorite HOTD beer thus far. 585 charactersstarrdogg, Jan 08, 2012

A: Well, not really a looker. Am extremely thin head formed, but dissipated almost immediately atop this reddish brown brew. Yup, that about covers it.
S: Loads of dark fruit mix beautifully with the oak and bourbon notes from the aging. Malty backbone presents itself and is accompanied with a warm boozy scent. My mouth is watering.
T: Very similar to the smell although I was able to detect more caramel and toffee along with those dark fruits. Bourbon flavors with vanilla are present, but by no mean overwhelm the other flavors.
M: Mild carbonation in the medium/heavy brew, slight burning as the brew passes down your throat. Becomes more prominent as the beer warms.
O: One fantastic brew that I wish came in a bigger bottle. Hint, Hint! 812 characterstjkinate, Jan 06, 2012

4.35/5  rDev -1.6%look: 2 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 412oz (2010) bottle into a snifter. Pours completely flat, deep cola brown. Not a single bubble; completely still. For that reason alone, I can't give it more than a 2.5 for appearance.
Aroma is rum-soaked tobacco, leather (I believe the first time I've ever used this descriptor), dark fruit, and vanilla.
Taste is even more impressive than the nose. Toffee, vanilla, pipe tobacco, oak. Complex caramel and booze; smoky, rich.
Mouthfeel is smooth, velvety, coating. Lack of carbonation is sincerely disappointing, though, and I have to dock points both on appearance and mouthfeel for it.
Overall a mixed bag. Aroma and taste are really complex and surprising, but the beer's flatness leaves me wishing for so much more. Next time I'll do a side/side between Matt and Adam, the similarities are pretty obvious. 814 charactersdraheim, Jan 01, 2012

At the time of this review, this is the #1 beer on the "Top Beers - American Strong Ale" list on beeradvocate.com
Served with Adam, Adam from the Wood, Cherry Adam from the Wood, Fred, Bourbon Fred, Doggie Claws '05.
Beer is completely flat, brown, sweet aroma, dark, legs on the glass which is a Stone IRS glass for those keeping score.
Aroma is malt, bourbon, apples, sweet, oak.
Beer is medium in body, really sweet, strong, very dry, a little too dry for me, but the more I drink the more I like it. Strong, sweet, nice liquor backbone, leading up to a bitterness-less finish that leave the mouth dry. I would have liked a less dry finish but ultimately this was good. 825 charactersdrabmuh, Dec 19, 2011

The beer appears nearly still and a dark brown color. The aroma is nice, with a lot of booze, pepper, spice, fruit, barrels. Smooth on the palate. Low carbonation with less booze in the flavor than was present in the aroma. Complex and delicious, this one is a slow sipper. Great blend of bourbon and fruit flavors, with light spice.

Deep brown, bordering on black with only a slight layer of head that forms and dissipates quickly. The swirl produces no legs, but does provide spotty foam and oily resin that coats the glass.
The taste and aroma are phenomenal. Raisins soaked in brandy, vanilla, toffee, caramel, dates, plums, and some vinous notes as well. There is a hint of peaty smoke in the finish. This is like a nice glass of sherry. I don't know that I have ever had a barrel aged beer that was this well-balanced and complex so shortly after it was bottled.
Easy to sip. Smooth, creamy, and full-bodied. There is just enough carbonation to let the full battery of flavors open up on the palate. Just about perfect in every way. 798 charactersNittanyBeerFan, Nov 23, 2011

12oz bottle poured into a snifter. 2010 release. 
A- Pours a very deep dark brown color with a minimal head that doesn't leave any lace. Pours more like a wine or spirit than beer. 
S- I can tell just from the aroma that this is going to be a sipper. Bourbon is very prominent in the nose along with caramel malt and alcohol. Dark fruits, leather, tobacco, and oak round out the nose. Hoping it tastes as good as it smells... 
T- The bourbon barrels definitely lead the way with some vanilla, oak, and brandied apples. As it warms the smoked malts become noticeable along with Belgian candy sugar, dark chocolate, red grapes, and raisins. The alcohol isn't exactly hidden, but I wouldn't have guessed it being 11.5% either.
M- Full bodied with very low carbonation. Thick and creamy with an almost syrupy feel that coats the mouth. 
O- Just a touch more carbonation and I can't imagine it getting any better. Very glad I got a chance to try this one. Thanks Jim! 1,063 charactersprojectflam86, Nov 21, 2011

very similar to the nose. vibrant and deep. dark sweet fruit, old tobacco, leather, and barrel aging notes. did not know this was barrel aged until now, but it makes perfect sense. given the flavors and aromas.

4.92/5  rDev +11.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Have had the privilege to drink this beer on multiple occasions. My first interaction with Matt was in 2009, when CoolJosh and I split a bottle of Bottleworks X Matt. I didn't appreciate that batch as much as I would my subsequent experiences. I next tried Matt (Batch 2) at Brouwer's in Seattle, and it was a life altering experience. I most recently tried Matt (Batch 2) thanks to Dan "NittanyBeerFan" while up visiting Penn State. That is the beer I am reviewing here.
A: Poured into the snifter a deep raisin mahogany. Imagine raisins and prunes blended to a liquid and poured (similar to prune juice I suppose) and that is what this beer looked like. Albeit it has some nice carbonation, but really it was on the softer side. Not much head to speak of, as it looked looked like a cloudy, rusty brandy after the head receded. Pretty much what I expected for this beer, especially after having various vintages and variations of Adam.
S: Mind-blowingly awesome. We poured at cellar temp, so the flavours immediately burst out of the glass. Rum-soaked raisins. Bourbon soaked prunes. Juicy dark fruits and figs. Vanilla/toffee/caramel/chocolate. Wood. The list is endless.
T: Just as good as the scent, the bourbon and brandy soaked dark fruits just explode through your taste buds. Sweetness from the bourbon, vanilla, and wood come into play next and balance out some bitter chocolate and minor hop presence. Just a cornucopia of flavours.
M: Creamy, thick, viscous. Light on the carbonation, but pretty much spot on for the style.
Overall, one of the top 10 best beer experiences I can remember. 1,605 characterstreyrab, Nov 15, 2011

4.34/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Look: Pours a nice slightly darker shade of brown with about a 1/8 head that does not stick around very long
Smell: The smell of the beer is by far the winner. There are several layers to the nose that create a great amount of depth. Upfront is a nice note of bourbon, oak, and vanilla. And finishes of with a chocolate covered apple character very nice.
Taste: The taste starts out very similar to the nose with very light touches of bourbon and oak but for me the beer has more chocolate than anything else very rich dark chocolate character and finishes off nicely with just a touch of apple
Mouthfeel: Medium body with low carbonation
Overall: Very good beer. Very solid and highly recommended. I am becoming more and more impressed with HotD 750 charactersDarthKostrizer, Nov 08, 2011

Rich and deliciou in the aroma with aroma of mollasses, licorice, dark cherries and hints of chocoloate. A big rich malty profile here that smells great. Rich on the pallet with caramel and mollasses with hints of dark fruit and kind of a soy sace finish. Pretty tasty.
The body is full but it's flat. We really need some carbonation to pull this together. Overall this taste great and smells great. It just needs some carbonation. This is my fourth HotD beer and the second that has been flat. That simply dissapoints. 722 charactersBendurgin, Oct 24, 2011

The aroma is full of fruity grape-skin with a touch of leather and chocolate. There are subtle notes of vanilla.
The taste starts out with a ton of leather and smoke, finishing with fruity grape. This has just enough sweetness in the finish.
This is medium bodied with zero carbonation.
I like this a lot. The lacking carbonation might be very off putting to many, I don't seem to mind it here. 499 charactersandrewinski1, Oct 24, 2011

4.62/5  rDev +4.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.52009 Release: Bottleworks X enjoyed at the tasting room in Portland.
Very dark brown colour with a miniature light tan head. Good head retention given the tiny head that was there to start with.
Bourbon and chocolate dominate the aroma with some very light apple brandy notes. Sweet caramel and some oaky vanilla round out the aroma.
Sweet malt flows into a spicy apple brandy and very light bourbon flavour. Well rounded with some light spiciness. The lush malt and ester profile has great length. Very interesting.
Medium light body with moderate carbonation. This is surprisingly light but still very, very good.
A great beer. Stunning aroma and flavour combine to provide a wonderful dessert beer. Well done Alan. 722 charactersdgilks, Oct 11, 2011
3.32/5  rDev -24.9%look: 2 | smell: 5 | taste: 3 | feel: 2 |  overall: 3I forgot about this one for a while.
Pours sludgy and brown without a single damn bubble. This beer has serious legs.
Smells incredible, so rich and deep. Oakey apple brandy, burnt sugar, vanilla, raisin, tobacco, leather. The taste is the same, but just too damn much of everything, including alcohol. Not overpowering, but just a bit much. There seems to be a competition to see which flavor can sting my tongue the most. Definitely a sipping beer, as even a small gulp burns my throat and numbs my lips. 
Carbonation probably would have done this beer wonders, but it is just barely there. And that is why I wish I hadn't traded something awesome for it. 
Now I'm going to drink a Cigar City BA Milk Porter by myself and forget about it. Literally. 755 characters7ways, Oct 07, 2011
4.44/5  rDev +0.5%look: 3 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.512 oz. bottle from 2010 poured into a snifter. Thanks Kan. Since I am on a Strong Ale/Old Ale/Barleywine kick for the past few months and this is the coldest day this far into Fall, it's the perfect occasion to drink the only bottle I have. Matt pours dark brown and looks almost black; the looks are in the Imperial Stout territory. There's no head whatsoever but there is a tiny ring holding promise of carbonation. I hear it's a crap shoot with HotD, and I think I am lucky.
 Matt boasts a very complex aroma, with distinct notes of roast, smoke, dark fruit, port, caramel/toffee and dark liqueur. And ripe apples! I can't wait to taste it, but I can't stop smelling it either.
 The base beer for Matt is Adam, which was a disappointment to me. However, the barrels have changed the beer massively, into something much better. My complaint against Adam was too much roast and too much bitterness. The roast is mellow in Matt, and the bitterness very restrained, along with the added sweetness and complexity.
 Sticky caramel sweetness, accompanied by still bold, roasty and chocolaty bitterness leading towards a slightly astringent finish. There is a lot of fruity-vinous character and ripe, sweet apple notes from eau-de-vie de pomme. I am loving it so much! This beer is one of the testimonials to the fact that American brewing today can stand up to Europe. Reminiscent of two of my favorite beers, Cuvee Van de Keizer Blauw and JW, and yet so different. And what restrained use of barrels, that have added so much character without the typical booze.
 While I am convinced that this beer will only improve with age, it hardly tastes young. In fact, had I not known the age, I would place it at 3 years, at least. A great beer, and perfect for this moment. It's beers like this that make trading worthwhile. I don't think I have anything in my stash that can excel Matt significantly. I won't be drinking anything else tonight.

This one poured a murky, reddish-brown color with just a suggestion of bubbles on top. Aromas of red apples, bourbon, plums, dates and molasses.

4.14/5  rDev -6.3%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 42010 bottle purchased and consumed @ the Hair of the Dog Brewery and Tasting Room (Portland, OR) on 9/3/11. Served in a tulip glass.
Pours a flat black in the glass, with literally no head to speak of. Maybe just the tiniest bit of retention hangs on the edges, with vigorous swirling getting a very light cascade of spotty lace. The aroma smells of cocoa, molasses, vanilla, and pithy darker fruit. Bourbon heat singes the edges of this, while some softer oak character is standing out as well, and I’m definitely getting a nice smoky roastiness across the back of the nostrils. 
The taste is thick with notes of chocolate, caramel, and ripe dark fruit character, while a gentle roasted smokiness spreads out across the back. Bourbon and alcohol gives this some real zip on the edges of the profile, mingling with notes of vanilla and oak, before pulling in the finish with a good bit of dryness and warmth. The mouthfeel is full bodied, with some alcohol heft and a soft carbonation combining to give this a heady feeling chewiness in the mouth. Speaking of the ABV, it’s actually fairly well kept in check, with any hotness to this appearing to mostly come from the bourbon flavors. 
This was certainly flavorful and complex but still had a bit of rawness to it from the barrel that held this back a bit for me. I’d love to try this with a bit more age on it, as I’ll bet this one soothes out nicely. It was still really awesome that I was able to buy this here at the brewery. 1,491 charactersKegatron, Sep 23, 2011

Appearance: Pours a clear deep mahogany-dark brown with a thin tan head that fades into a small ring round the side of the glass.
Aroma: Just a touch of apples, most of the apple aroma has faded by now sadly, bourbon and brandy, with roasted grain and a smokey characteristic. 
Taste: Wonderfully complex! Brandy, bourbon, oak, vanilla, smokey, dark fruit, raisins, a touch of booze, and caramel.
Mouthfeel: Silky smooth with medium body and low carbonation.
Overall: I could easily drink a few of these, but my liver probably would be upset. Incredibly complex, a real treat! 684 charactersjamescain, Sep 15, 2011

A: Pours dark brown with two quarters of tan head.
S: Wow! Roasted malt, bourbon and a hint of apple. I really get the brandy like aromas.
S: Sweet roasted malt, bourbon and smoked malt hit almost simultaneously followed closely by the apple brandy flavors. The finish is burnt sugar and raisin. And yea it's boozy, but I like the alcohol heat in this beer. As it warms the chocolate flavors really come out.
M: Thick body that is slick on the tongue. Lower then average carbonation.
O: I'm a wine guy as well, so I love a beer that reminds me of a fine port or brandy. Love this beer. A sipper for sure. Thanks again Eric! 687 charactersjale, Sep 13, 2011

The beer let out very little gas when I popped the bottle. I have had this before at the brewery, and I remember it being somewhat flat, but I didn't remember it being this flat, oh well. Poured into large bowl snifters.
A: Brown/aged tawny red, very syrupy looking oily almost.
S: Smokey, fruity, oaky, hints of tobacco, leather, candied orange rind...super complex, I could keep going; should I? Ok, maybe I will...there is also a hint of nuttyness, hazelnuts?, sweet mead, roasted apples, a bit of tar, and a dash of awesome.
T: Same as above, but with more oomph.
M: Slightly hot, but with the cigar it cuts right through the smoke and suppliments it in a very nice way.
O: Worth every penny. 854 charactersOldPenguinHunter, Aug 20, 2011
3.61/5  rDev -18.3%look: 3 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 2.5 |  overall: 3.5Thanks to KickInTheChalice for sharing this one. 2010 version.
Pours a deep, nearly soy sauce brown with no head despite a vigorous pour.
Nose is overwhelmed by apple brandy. A bit of sweet caramel malt underneath. Possibly a hint of smoke - but not prominant.
Taste is interesting - definitely get a lot of wood - however the taste reminds me of spruce or possibly pine. Adding to the palate are rich malty caramel sugars and dark fruits. Finish is just a bit boozy. The lack of carbonation hurts the flavor - it's still interesting and subtle, but would be vastly improved with some creamy carbonation.
Moutfeel is dissapointing. A bit thin and completely flat.
Overall - wish I had had this on draft. It's pretty tasty, but not as good as I'd expected. 760 charactersreadbaron, Aug 19, 2011
3.81/5  rDev -13.8%look: 3 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 2.5 |  overall: 3.5Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a tulip.
Appearance: No carbonation in this beer means there is no head sitting on top of a dark brown beer with a cherry tint.
Smell: Lots of apple brandy, which by itself provides a lot of complexity. Some brown sugar and caramel malt join in the background.
Taste: Caramel malt with some brown sugar up front, some figs, raisins, and a touch of sweet cherries next, then a good dash of apple brandy. A bit of alcohol bite, a touch of what I can best describe as spruce, and some general spiciness close out the flavor. It has a relatively clean finish.
Mouthfeel: The complete lack of carbonation reduces my enjoyment of the beer and is fairly noticeable throughout each sip. Other than that, it has a full body, some stickiness, and some slight alcohol burn in the back of the throat.
Overall: Proper carbonation would make this better and really send it into a different category. As is, the flavor is pretty good, but it just does not have all the pieces. 999 charactersKickInTheChalice, Aug 19, 2011

Pour is very dark, opaque, brown, no head except for a few bubbles, looks like a very old spirit. Ugly but cute at the same time, I like it Aroma is definately on the spirit/oak side of things, strong notes of molasses and vanilla. Taste is very, very sweet. I was afraid a little by the aroma, I thought we were on our way to a boozy mess, but the taste is so boldly sweet, with no off flavors at all, just a warm, sweet, monster sipper. Lots of calvados flavour, toffee, caramel. Palate is completely flat, good alcohol warmth, so long and silky in the mouth. I guess this is perfect for a cold winter evening, but it worked well for us on a hot july afternoon. While it was excellent, I found it very hard to drink hence the lower overall rating 803 charactersLuk13, Aug 07, 2011
4.86/5  rDev +10%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Huge thanks to Beerzebub for the overwhelming generosity that he always shows me. 2010 bottle. The brew pours a near-still cola-brown hue; there is no head or bubbles but the liquid is viscous enough to leave slight legs upon the glass. The look is rustic and menacing. The nose is, on the contrary, the most absolutely inviting thing imaginable; the complexity is literally astounding. There is a plethora of sensory delights to behold within the flavor and aroma of Matt. Notes of charred brown sugar, toffee, raisin-dark fruit, cherries, hardwood smoke, tannic oak, buttery vanilla, booze, leather, and that familiar HotD twang - just to mention the most prominent associations - all make for a very familiar set of elements but they are combined here in an unusual and novel way. The feel is more lively than the look suggests, and is quite silky as well. Overall this is far and away the best HotD brew I've had (and that is saying something because I've had some great ones.) Lives up to any and all hype. 1,011 charactersktrillionaire, Jul 29, 2011
4.87/5  rDev +10.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.512oz. bottle poured into a snifter. 2010 Vintage. Got this awhile ago in a trade but again, cannot remember whom; thank you whoever you were!
(A)- Pours a thick near pitch black color. Produced a surprisingly good tan colored cap of froth that actually lingered for awhile.
(S)- Very deep and rich notes of mild booze soaked raisin/plum/prune. Bits of leather, applewood, cocoa, and maybe even a hint of licorice/smoke. Definitely not a heavy booze smell, but it is there. Extremely complex and inviting; my review most likely pales in comparison to everything going on in this.
(T)- Extremely similar to the smell if not exactly spot on. Some great bits of lightly smoked raisin and prune/plum. That applewood component from the smell definitely has carried over into the taste too, if not a tad more pronounced. Bits of leather, cocoa, and very mild licorice too. Very complex and rich, but also harmonious in its complex explosion of flavor with each sip. Just excellent. Again, my description fails in comparison to what is going on here.
(M)- A wonderfully mellow (though very much welcomed) carbonation level. I was afraid it would almost be non-existent, but the level is perfect for what is needed to fit this beer's profile. The balance is also just outstanding. Yes, the barrel aging is obvious, but absolutely expertly integrated into the overall profile of the beer instead of taking it over. At a relatively hefty 11.5%ABV, this honestly tastes and drinks like a 8%; incredibly smooth yet rich and decadent. Absolutely superb.
(D)- I am blown away by this beer. Expertly balanced without being overpowering while still remaining complex. Just expertly blended while still showcasing all its rich flavors. Its just that damn good!
It is still very much a sipper, but one that is quickly disappearing from my glass. Hair of the Dog has my attention already, but I think this is their best beer I have had so far. Easily my most favorite strong ale to date. Absolutely spectacular. 1,996 characterssweemzander, Jul 29, 2011

Bottle to Flute
12 oz
Bottleworks X & 2nd batch
App- A very dark beer, browns and reds in the glass. No real head, just the normal HOTD bubbles around the edges, no lace, no cling
Smell- Big ol punch in the nose. Bourbon, fruits, sweet, malty. More of the dark fruits with a sugary note and a bit thick.
Taste- It's a very different taste for a strong ale. Its deeply thick with the bourbon and has a lot of darker fruits to lend a balance to it with some chocolate tinges and not sure what else is there but there is a lot of it.
Mouth- Medium bodied and medium carbonated. Very thick on the mouth and very creamy.
Drink- To be able to try both at one time I was very happy. Thick, boozy, tastefully balanced and well done. 749 charactersFosterJM, Jul 25, 2011

4.19/5  rDev -5.2%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4I'm sitting here with my woman, thinking, "What a strangely good beer this is." Matt, from Hair of the Dog brewery in Portland, Oregon is a special release that I got hooked up with at Bottleworks in Seattle. Thus review is drinking the 2010 vintage.
Boyo boy oh boy. It looks pretty normal pouring a deep brown with minimal head and lace, but wow! What a punch in the nose when you smell it. Bourbon meets Belgium meets fruit - apples and smoke. It's all there. The last time a beer smelled this complex was a while back. My only complaint is that I'm just hit a personal fan of smoke. 
It's not overly smokey though, in smell or taste. It's more subtle. What comes through mostly is the candy sugar, the sweetness of bourbon in the back of the throat, and some apple fruit too. Almost like an aged barleywine. So much comes from the barrels, it's a generously smooth beer. Very very sweet an rich. Dessert in a glass, if you can handle it.
Almost like a sherry, Matt goes down very easy, and you don't see the alcohol at 11.5% at all. In fact, it's so well composed that you could drink it for a while if you can deal with the caloric intake.
Simply put, Matt is one bad dog. Not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good. 1,224 charactersafksports, Jul 15, 2011

Dark chocolate brown blending into matte black. A dense half-finger head of light tan quickly becomes a thin ring. 
Lots of barrel character in the nose. Very buttery, with bourbon, vanilla, dark sweet cherries and toasted coconut. It’s good, but I wish there was more of the underlying beer. 
Ooh. Speaking of the underlying beer. The flavor begins like the nose, with the initial hit of barrel character in the form of vanilla extract, butterscotch and cherry. After the swallow, smokiness steps in, reminding of bacon or pork. The barrel character itself isn’t incredible, but when the smoke rolls in, it's absolutely incredible. It’s like sipping bourbon in front of a campfire, and I like it more with each sip. 
The creamy, buttery feel is like velvet on the tongue, so smooth and substantial. The carbonation lightly massaging my tongue is perfect here. Alcohol is noticeable as a tongue-numbing sensation, but it’s otherwise impressively blended. 
Incredible. I don’t believe I’ve ever had a barrel-aged smoked beer before, but I love it. The smoke is perfect and smooth, like the aroma left in your clothes after a good cigar. Looks like I’m going to have to get some more Matt. 1,328 charactersPhelps, Jun 29, 2011
4.59/5  rDev +3.8%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5The term "unique" doesn't even begin to describe this beer. It's unique in so many ways, and exceptional in all of them. Beer pours a very dark brown with a minimal head and is somewhat viscous. The smell of this beer is amazing. Apples, bourbon, leather, a little tobacco. 
None of them, except maybe the apples are overpowering, but the balance is outstanding. It's a boquet that's honestly quite unique. The taste and mouthfeel follow perfectly. There is a burst of so many complex flavors and then the very smooth finish at the end. 
This beer really does not disappoint. It's one of the best that I've had in a long time and it was worth the wait. 654 charactersmoz9, Jun 26, 2011
4.27/5  rDev -3.4%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.52010 bottle. A rough pour into my tulip resulted in just a smattering of bubbles around the rim of the glass. The beer was a rich, deep brown with red undertones. Although I wasn't expecting a big head/blatant signs of strong carbonation with this style of beer, I was a little worried that this first time trying Matt might end up like my experience with 2011 Cherry Adam - overly flat and syrupy. 
The smell was full of complex aromas. Super sweet caramel toffee, prunes & figs, leather, alcohol, malty bourbon oak, apple and vanilla. The taste was as rich as the nose. Initially I was in a wash of sweet dark sugary ambrosia which was quickly balanced out by the sharp alcohol, dark fruit and lingering fruity vanilla finish. Mouthfeel was slick, low carb and full bodied. My fears of a 2011 CAftW-letdown were quickly quashed after a couple drinks. This was a real pleasure to drink and, having just finished my glass I'm sure I'm going to try to chase another one of these down in the future. Having had a couple vintages of CAftW and FFtW, this is the best HotD offering I've had the opportunity to drink. 1,112 characterssurlytheduff, Jun 24, 2011

2009 Bottleworks X bottle.
12oz bottle poured into my Hair of the Dog Tulip.
A - Dark brown, with reddish edges, only a few large dark tan bubbles form on one side.
S - Old fruit, and burnt sugar.
T - Bitter fruit, bad candy, and old leather.
D - No carbonation at all, totally flat.
O - I love HotD, but I was let down with this one. 377 charactersHuskyinPDX, Jun 16, 2011
3.73/5  rDev -15.6%look: 2 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Poured into a snifter. 2010 vintage. Big thanks to piclee for this.
2.0 A: Deep brown almost black color. Minimally carbonated and did not form a head.
4.0 S: Leathery bourbon and slightly boozy apple brandy are most noticeable. Bourbon adds tobacco and peat elements. Underneath there is fig, raisin, smoke, prune, and hints of chocolate. Caramel galore. The barrels give a subtle vanilla and a slightly more aggressive oak. Pretty good here, but a little subdued overall. Some more carbonation certainly would have helped.
3.5 T: The taste is much unlike the nose in that the flavors are INTENSE! Again, bourbon and apple brandy strike first, but this is definitely not a bourbon bomb (which I always appreciate since I'm one of a few people on here that like beer more than bourbon). Bourbon and brandy give leather, peat, tobacco, plenty of sweet but earthy apple, a pleasant vanilla, and moderate amounts of oak. Fairly boozy as the full 11.50% is realized. Again there's plenty of dark fruit: fig, plum, prune, raisin, and a bit of black currant. Ridiculously complex with tons of caramel. However, this beer has one fatal flaw that dropped the taste score quite a bit. It's distractingly sweet. The first sip almost knocked me on my ass. Toward the end of the glass, I'm starting to get used to it, but I'd rather really enjoy 12 oz instead of 3 or 4. I'm pretty sure this would still be a bit too sweet if it had carbonated the whole way, but who knows.
4.5 M: Full body. Even in spite of the lacking carbonation (there is a little bit), this is wonderful on the tongue. Rich and velvety, which is just what I what for a beer of this nature. Just the slightest bit chewy and fairly smooth given the booziness.
4.0 D: Good beer that could have been great. Great balance between the barrel components and the beer itself. While this wasn't totally flat, the lack of proper carbonation made the nose less impressive, the taste too sweet, and prevented the mouthfeel from being a perfect 5.0. I would easily want to drink this again with a hope of better carbonation. 2,076 charactersDavoleBomb, Jun 10, 2011
5/5  rDev +13.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Special thanks to Johndoe08 for cracking open a bottle of my namesake beer.
A- Pours a nice uniform dark brown with minimal carbonation.
S- Has a bit of smoke and liquor on the nose, but the biggest note I get is apples. Turns out this beer is aged in apple brandy barrels. Well, that explains that. 
T- Deliciously complex. Complexly delicious. Barrel, apples, smoke, leather, chocolate, love, beauty, happiness. 
M- Perfect. Just enough to allow all the flavor to present itself without being too thick or overbearing, not too thin to dilute any of the complex flavors rocking your world. Hooray!
O- I am proud that a beer that carries my name does not suck, and is in fact... actually pretty awesome. I'm glad I have more bottles to open on a special occasion. Fantastic beer. 784 charactersMCorrea, Jun 05, 2011

Pours a flat crimson with some firey red highlights. Flacid looking evil.
Sweet and sugary apple brandy, rich dark fruits, figs, prunes, dates, and a smattering of nuttiness. Walnuts? Really complex and inviting. There's so much happening on the nose.
Flavor is quite luxurious as well. Apple brandy is front a center. Ice creamy booziness. Bourbon is tempered but present. Charred paper and smoke linger along the periphery and the dark fruits take a firm grip upon the proceedings. A big, rich, complex beer that I found myself greatly immersed in. Lack of any real heat makes this a stunner.
Mouthfeel is full, thick, supple, and decadent with little carbonation. 
Overall: Hair of the Dog is a personal favorite and this does not disappoint. Given the price tag and relative rarity of this, I'd reach for Adam more frequently (my God I love that beer), but this is a real treat. 971 charactersBarrytheBear, Jun 04, 2011

A: I've had some HotDog gushers before, but this beer was totally flat. A very dark color.
S: Definately a strong alcohol aroma. Not much else.
T: Simply put this is one of the most complex tasting flavorful beers that I have ever had. Caramel, Chocolate, Apples, Smoke. Incredible.

4.57/5  rDev +3.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Now that I've had three of these I feel it's time to review it. All three have been almost the same experience.
Giving a vigorous pour into my HotD tulip only rustles up a whiff of bubbles that quickly fade to nothing. Leaving me with a obsidian dark liquid that refuse to allow light to pass even when held up to the light.
I can't get over the amazing aroma of this beer. Bourbon, caramel, vanilla, dried fruit and a wonderful smokiness all come across in a wonderful balance. I find myself sniffing this thing three times for each drink.
The bourbon and dried fruits are the first flavors to meet your palate and boy are they glorious. Next up is the caramel and vanilla which are nicely balanced and not overpowering. The final flavors to approach the palate are a bit of chocolate and some smokiness. Amazing is all that can be said. Wonderful flavors that take their turn on the the stage to put on a perfect performance.
I would say this is medium to full bodied with just the right amount of carbonation. If there were more carbonation you just might call the finish to this beer hot. But as it stands, the finish stings a bit but feels great.
Aside from maybe wanting a bit of a head on my beer, I find no real faults here. I would give this beer a perfect 5, but then Alan would have nothing to improve on. This beers lives up to it's hype and is well worth the effort to get ahold of.

4.32/5  rDev -2.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Trying desperately to get caught up on all my hand written reviews, I found this little gem scribbled on a folded up piece of paper in my desk. 
Making a somewhat random comment here but it applies to the appearance even though it plays no part in my scoring of this review. This beer was stored upside-down and on it's side during it's travels to me. When it arrived it was placed in my cellar for a couple months. When I finally opened the brew to share with some friends, stuck under the cap had a thick layering of yeast that looked exactly like mud. That was a first for me.
2010 year, 12oz bottle poured into a mini snifter. The brew appears strikingly dark, almost pitch black in color with a thin penline of head. A swirl stirs up bubbles which bunch up and collect around the rim of the glass. When held to the light, it shows some brown clarity around the edges.
The smell of this brew includes a pleasant smoked character, not quite pete'd but very enjoyable in a campfire sort of way. More smells reveal grainy sweetness like chocolate and fruity alcohol esters like plum and raisin with a touch of something apple-like. It includes a big booze factor with a light tangy to it.
The taste of this brew is big and boozy. There is a pleasant bitterness which seemingly comes more from the roasted quality of the grain instead of the hops. The pleasant smoked character found upfront in the nose makes it's way through the taste mid-palate. There is a contrasting flavor contradiction of residual sugary sweetness (which is faint) verse a fruited tangy booze aspect. The aftertaste includes notes of coffee and earthy qualities with a lasting bitterness.
This is a full bodied brew with a light, enjoyable level of carbonation. Big abv factor that does not attempt to be hidden. I forsee this brew becoming increasingly enjoyable as time passes. The alcohol at this point is very warming, fusel and seemingly evaporative on the tongue yet it is quite enjoyable. This brew was not at all what I expected but it was very enjoyable nonethelss. 2,053 charactersstakem, May 12, 2011

A: Pours a dark brown color. Almost opaque with a bit of ruby around the edges. A small beige head forms, and recedes in a second to nothing.
S: Huge malty aromas. Toasted caramel, light coffee and smoke as the base. A great apple and wood combo comes in next from the barrel. I love it.
T: Follows the nose with a great toasted malt flavor. A large sweetness, but balanced well with the wood flavors. Oak, and fruits. Apples, raisins, and cherries. Very much like sherry. Excellent.
M/D: A full body that is low on the carbonation. So smooth, velvety, and creamy. This is one of the easiest sippers that I have had in a long time. Just a treat.
An amazing beer. A great sipper, and so complex. Like a fine wine/sherry. I am so glad I got to try this again. Highly recommended. 922 characterschamp103, May 09, 2011

2010 vintage.
Pours a dark brown almost black, with a thin toffee color head that quickly dissipates to leave a very thin ring of bubbles around the glass.
The aroma is bourbon upfront with apple and dark fruit, and a faint tobacco.
The bourbon is a bit more blended with dark fruit and apple notes. There is subtle toffee and caramel, though a leathery tobacco profile keeps it from becoming too sweet. It also has some pleasant chocolate notes towards the finish.
Has smooth medium body with fairly low, but very appropriate carbonation. The body could be a bit more thick, though it still fits quite well.
What to say about this beer? It has reminded me why I love Hair of the Dog so much. Just a very complex and well done beer that I wish I had a lot more of. 795 charactersvkv822, May 08, 2011

A: Pours a very dark brown with no visible carbonation or head. Looks nice and thick with some dark red hues through the edges when swirled in my glass.
S: Big sweet bourbony and malty aromas, some apple and dark fruit as well, perhaps dates and some alcohol.
T: This is absolutely fantastic. Incredibly smooth, a hint of smokiness with smooth bourbon, dark fruit and sweet apple from the Eau de Vie barrels. Very little heat is detectable for an 11.5% barrel aged strong ale. The flavors combine ridiculously well with each other, this is a true masterpiece of a brew. Definitely way up there, one of my all time favorites.
M: Amazingly creamy and smooth. A slight tingle on my tongue from the little bit of carbonation that is in here. The slightly syrupy mouthfeel coats my entire mouth with tons of great flavors that linger for a very long time. Near perfect.
O: Incredible, so many great distinct flavors that combine in total harmony with one another. Every little sip goes a very long way, packing gobs of delicious flavors. Great warming feel in my stomach as I savor each sip. I love this beer. I would definitely drink a glass of this before going to sleep every night if I could. This is heaven in a glass, what more can be said? Please keep brewing this Alan, I want more! 1,358 charactersAzurescens, Apr 16, 2011
4.3/5  rDev -2.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5500th review. Big thanks to ipa247 (Jeff) for this one. 2010 2nd release version. Poured into a Darkness snifter. Shared with schen9303. 
A: Standard pour yields a .5 finger off-white fine head with moderate retention that dissipates into a thick ring around the glass. Beer is an opaque dark brown. Lacing is spotty and patchy with moderate cling and nice legs. An attractive beer overall. 
S: Nose is apple puree and brandy. Nutty backdrop. Caramel, toffee, and brown sugar. Aromatic, sweet and very complex. 
T: Opens sweet apple brandy and brown sugar. Spicy cinnamon and nutty notes towards the middle with a moderate helping of booziness. Caramel and toffee come in towards the middle and end, further sweetening things. End is sweet brown sugar and some dark over-ripe fruit. Finish is spicy with a sweet, nutty, aftertaste. Very impressive. An oustandingly tasty beer. 
M: Medium to full bodied and moderately carbonated. Slightly pricky and spicy in the mouth but goes down warm and smooth. Finish is sticky and messy with an aftertaste that lingers. Pleasant and spot on for its style. 
O: Probably the best HotD beer that I've had to date, Matt is really impressive. Incredible taste and solid in every other aspect, this one is definitely worth seeking out. 1,274 charactersSpeedwayJim, Apr 09, 2011
4.02/5  rDev -9%look: 1.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 2.5 |  overall: 4Waiting a long time to try this one. I have pretty high expectations.
In terms of appearance, this beer looks disgusting. No head, no lacing, no legs. Just dark brown oily grossness - distinctly reminiscent of the stuff that comes up in a nasogastric tube lavage during a small bowel obstruction.
Smell is good - booze, vanilla, oak, and nuttiness.
Taste is outstanding - sugar, vanilla, chocolate, and mild roasts. Good stuff. 
Mouthfeel is very oily. Sort of weird. 
The taste and smell were outstanding, but the appearance and mouthfeel were pretty poor. Overall, a good beer, but not something I would go crazy looking for in the future. 646 charactersairohead2001, Apr 05, 2011

A: Dark, dark brown in color with almost no head. A vigorous pour yielded about 12 bubbles total. There's not even a crown after 1 minute.
S: The smell has a lot of caramel followed by a little cinnamon and a little apple. There's a touch of tobacco smokiness at the finish mixed with a little alcohol.
T: There's a lot going on in the flavor profile here. The start is quite sweet caramel apple. In a strange way the middle is a mix of brown sugar type sweetness and, barrel aging, and smoky malts impart a barbeque sauce style flavor in the middle. The finish lends itself more toward the smoked oak with some pear in there as well.
M: I would have liked a little more carbonation, The viscosity was appropriate.
O: Overall this is a very unique beer. I enjoyed the originality of it, but I'm doubt I will seek it out again. 886 charactersglazeman, Apr 05, 2011

4.44/5  rDev +0.5%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Second batch, 2010, opened on March 24, 2011. I originally planned on holding onto this for some time since it was hot at a tasting in January, but I was lucky enough to receive a second as an extra from a very generous BA.
The color of fine wood, Matt pours a dark auburn or sienna with, as expected, almost no head or lacing.
A beautiful, decadent nose. Sweetened cocoa, molasses, and a tiny bit of smoked malts give way to bright green apple brandy, sherry, and whiskey. While the description is a mess, Matt isn't. It's rich and dark with wonderful green apple and dark fruit complementing all the best things about Adam - tobacco, earth, and sweet molasses.
Trying to describe this one is exhausting. It opens sweetly, with green apple and a stronger whiskey note on the front of the palate. Tons of toffee, molasses, and candied sugar join mid-palate, along with some balancing leathery maltiness and peat. Amazingly, Matt somehow manages to avoid being cloying, drying out mid-to-late palate. I remember this one being "hot," but, truth be told, it's warming without being distractingly boozy. 
Low carbonation, sticky and syrupy, like a liqueur. It feels big. 
What a beer, truly unlike any I've had before. This is probably my favorite barrel-aged HotD offering to date. It's not without its flaws, but it's a decadent beer fit for commemorating whatever you have worth commemorating. Truth be told, I struggled to finish the bottle - it's a bit cloying, rich and drinks hot enough to warrant splitting. 1,517 charactersVerecund, Mar 25, 2011
4.52/5  rDev +2.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5This is the 2010 batch, about 4 or 5 months after release.
If I had to do a one-word review, it would be "complex." Of course, that doesn't say anything about how damn good this beer is, so thankfully I have the chance to expound.
Appearance: A dark reddish-brown that is translucent at the edges. Minimal caramel-colored head which dissipates after 10 minutes or so in my Delirium tulip.
The aroma on this beer is decadent. Vanilla and/or caramel are most readily apparent, but there's also fruitiness of the dried stone fruit variety, as well as a faint whiff of apples. The combination of barrels used gives a slight impression of caramel-covered apples. I had to knock a half-point off, though, because after taking a sip, the alcohol rears its head in the aroma with a strong solvent character.
The taste is less sweet than I expected from the aroma; there is a definite hop character in the aftertaste, but not much bitterness. Bitterness would have definitely been out-of-place in this beer. I think the alcohol cuts through any sweetness and helps to balance it, thus redeeming the occasional solvent aroma.
The taste is also where the smoked malts become evident, but just barely. I might be trying too hard to convince myself that I'm tasting smokiness, but I don't really think so. There is an apple character, too, but it's closer to apple skins than anything distinctly fruity.
The finish is remarkably clean, given the relatively viscous mouthfeel. Carbonation is just right, which is to say it is quite low. Not flat by any definition, but low. 
Overall, this is one of my favorite beers of the last year or two. I actually do want another one, but I also don't want to be hungover tomorrow, so I will reluctantly abstain. 1,744 charactersinflatablechair, Mar 22, 2011

Pours flat, mahogany on the edges, opaque brownish black in the center with thin wisps of bubbles on top reminiscent of wood grain 
Smells of smoke, hotdogs, cured meat. If I really reach I get vanilla, oak. Vanilla and apple come forward with warmth
 Smoke, apples, vanilla, charred oak. Significantly better as it warms. Rich and sweet malt character, yet it finishes dry on the palate with just the charred barrel character lingering. Pretty complex.
Rich and velvety on the palate. Not too heavy. Minimal but acceptable carbonation.
This beer was pretty off putting to me initially, but as it came to room temp it really opened up. Tasty beer. I enjoyed the bottle of the new batch more. Not sure if it's the age or batch variation. 769 charactersMrFootstones, Mar 21, 2011

Pours a cloudy dark brown color, almost black in the tulip glass with zero bubbles or lacing. This one looks flat. Amazing aroma. Loads of dark chocolate, fudge brownies, maple syrup, a touch of smokiness, and lots of dark fruit with a slight burn of alcohol in the nose. Wow, this is one of the best smelling brews I've come across. Taste is right on par with the aroma. Chocolate is front and center, then it's backed up by a syrupy maple-like sweetness, brown sugar, with maybe a touch of herbal hops on the finish, but there's no bitterness whatsoever. This is outrageously sweet, but damn, I like it. More fudge and a nutty, creamy finish. YUM! The only downfall of this beer is that it's completely flat. There was a slight hiss when I popped the cap, but there's really no carbonation which detracts from the creamy, silky mouthfeel. If this had bubbles, it would be an A+ winner all the way. The 11%+ alcohol is almost non-detectable, and well hidden. I sipped this one over the course of an hour and enjoyed every drop. Smells great, tastes great, but give me some carbonation!! 
Thanks again, Chris! 1,201 charactersKeefD, Mar 07, 2011

First judged will be Matt (Bottleworks X.) Thanks to msubulldog25 for this gem. Shared with the La Crosse tasting group during our epic battle of the 12 ozers. Poured into a snifter:
A - Pours dark brown almost hard black. Hardly any carbonation. Very small lacing. Murky bubbles and slight clouds of foam in the middle.
S - Nice smokey smell and apple brandy. Really a nice boozy heat thats just awesome. Little bit of apples, cherries and caramel which are just delicious.
T - Really nice and sweet from a variety of apples. Bourbon and brandy that mix together very well and provide a nice heat. Reminds me of Adam but better (go figure.)
M - Really smooth and a bit hot but aging very nicely.
D - I found this one more brandy forward than bourbon forward. I really liked this one a lot, better than the new Matt. This one is aging really nicely and I'm so happy to have another bottle in my cellar. 
4/5/5/4.5/4.5
Now reviewing 2010 Matt. Shared by brian23456. Thanks for providing this one to test side by side with the other Matt. Poured into snifter:
A - Way more carbonation. Color is quite like the Bottleworks X in that it is deep brown and black with nice hues or caramel brown around the edges. This one has a thin foam cap that dies to a foam ring around the edges. Lacing is pretty good.
S - Brown sugar, caramel and oak. More bourbon forward than brandy as seen in the 09. Nice heat bite from the barrel. A bit smokey and leathery, but awesome nonetheless. 
T - Really creamy, caramel and brown sugar. The bourbon and brandy mix nicely together. Also getting a bit of smoke and leather, with a bit of apple and peat.
M - A bit thicker than the 09. Creamy carbonation. Heat but not hot from the booze.
D - This one was more bourbon forward than brandy forward. I was impressed at the level of carbonation in this but still liked the 09 a little bit better. Great beers to try side by side (you'd be amazed at the difference.) Wonderful brews and a great treat.

T/M-Thin and boozy, with almost no carbonation. Tons of bourbon character up front, with notes of cocoa powder and marzipan. Gets fairly boozy mid-palate, and finishes hot. This could use a little bit of carbonation.

T - The fruity sweetness is rather overpowering. Tastes a little past it's prime. The oak is noticeable, but the fruit flavors dominate, like dark plum. I'm a little disappointed, with such a great smelling beer, I expected more. It's not a good tasting beer. It's terrible. It could be improperly aged, it could in fact just not age well, or just be a bad beer. I don't know which of the above, I just know it was not good.
M - very thin. Could use more carbonation, and body. For Barrel Aged beers, this is the low end of the spectrum for mouthfeel. It's a shame.
D - ah, not that good. The beer is a tease. It smells so good and inviting. The taste is just a fruity mess. It's overly sweet, and not enough barrel to help balance it out. The beer was practically a drainpour, but I can manage a 4 ounce serving.
O - well, I'm glad to say I have ticked this bad boy, and the Bottleworks version of it at that. I just expected more from it. People talk up a lot of beers, and this just adds to the list of disappointments. Oh well, it was worth trying. 1,348 charactersabecall98, Mar 05, 2011

4.44/5  rDev +0.5%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 42010 Vintage 12oz bottle received in a trade with a generous BA thanks!
Appearance: Pours a deep chestnut brown with the faintest red highlights around the edges. The crown is non existent although the tiniest off white circle of lace has formed around the outside perimeter of the body.
Smell: Nice lightly charred smoky wood, apple, a delicious whiff of alcohol, and a hint of chocolate. 
Taste: Same as the nose for the most part but the chocolate appears in the beginning, the apple takes over, then alcohol finishes.
Mouthfeel: Fairly full bodied and a bit low on carbonation but with the high abv and the flavor profile it works well!
Drinkability: Its a big beer for sure but its tasty as well!

4.44/5  rDev +0.5%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 412 oz. bottle courtesy of uhwutur8, picked up at the original release, poured in to a tulip.
Appearance: Pours a smoky, woody charcoal, opaque to even direct light save for around the edges, where it's reduced to a vaguely translucent cherry copper amber. An aggressive pour became more aggressive when the head seemed slow to form, though even that didn't coax more than half an inch out. It seemed for a time that there would be no head, before a sudden late surge of effervescence burst forth from the depths, though it didn't rise with enough quickness to actually result in the formation of any crown. It instead rose at approximately the same level at which it dissipated at the surface, resulting in a thin, delicate collar, breath of snow on the surface, and nothing of note on the side of the tulip. Subsequent sips, however, do save this one's score by leaving nice dashes and patches of snow dripping and dotting up and down along the sides of the glass. 
Aroma: Can I get this in an air freshener please? Easily this beer's best attribute, the nose is absolutely brimming with aromatic barrel notes and spices and ripe with sweet fruits. From a base of mellow and mature smoky malts mingling with cocoa, toast, and molasses, this one evolves in to a symphony of fruity and spirit-like overtones, from the obvious influences of the Apple Eau de Vie (or, more properly, Eau de Vie de Pomme) barrels - contributing pure cider tones as well as a nice sherry-like liquor tone - and the bourbon, the latter of which is remarkably mature and sublime, its faint spicyness and refined profile interacting beautifully with the barrel sugars and lighter malt sugars of the base beer. Just fantastic.
Taste: A fantastic flavor profile on this one, though not quite up to par with the nose. The base beer is sweet, though not by any means cloying - there's enough toast, dark toffee, molasses, earth, and fat, thick, dark smoke to counteract the brighter caramel, honey-like Candi sugar notes, and bready Munich malts, not to mention the slew of fruit sugars concentrated in this one. While we're on the topic, the array of fruits represented here is remarkable - from the obligatory apple to, in order: pears, apricots, peaches, lychee fruit, cherries, dates, figs, and white raisins. The whole thing is amplified by the "cane syrup" factor, or that which naturally accompanies all canned fruits from my childhood. The barrel notes - a faint amount of wood, though plenty of vanilla and less coconut - mingle with an impressively faded quantity of alcohol, all the more impressive given the 11.5% as well as the harsh overtones associated with the spirits here generally. 
Mouthfeel: Very low, almost non-existent carbonation doesn't too much for a beer that's already quite sweet. Honey-like in its thickness, this one is marginally cloying at points, like a liqueur, though the alcohol spice and barrel notes keep it interesting enough that it's not a sugary mess. 
Drinkability: Maybe I'm just growing curmudgeonly in my old beer age. This beer straddles a very interesting divide, showcasing both deep, smoky, dark toastiness as well as bright, green, fruity overtones. As a genre-blending experiment, it succeeds - I've never had a beer quite like this, to be sure. And not to sell it short - it succeeds on several other levels too, least of which is the divine nose and the masterful blending and complexity of the mouth. But I still require lift, head, lace, et al - this one had its procedural defects, and though they're not glaring, they do take their toll; it was a little difficult to finish those essentially flat final few sips. Of course, all that being said, this was still a pretty damn awesome beer - it's not every day you're going to get this many flavors and aromas out of a single 12 oz. bottle. Here's (three years late) to Bottleworks 10th Anniversary and to HotD for a great brew. 3,911 charactersCrellMoset, Feb 18, 2011

Pours a slightly translucent dark brown. Smells of sweet figs, boozy raisins and a small amount of hops. A bit of smoke and maybe a touch of apple round it out. One of the more complex noses on a beer I have had. The taste is a crazy combination of mild hops (or other bitterness), rum raisins, dark fruit, smoke, apple, booze and vanilla. A lot going on in there. Feels like I could keep sipping it and get more flavors. Really heavy in the mouth with limited carbonation. Definitely a sipper, this is either a good sharing beer or a beer to be enjoyed in front of a fire, slowly, on a cold night. 658 charactersseeswo, Jan 19, 2011

A: The beer pours into the glass with an impenetrable darkness and a small khaki colored head.
S: A very sweet and complex nose here. Lots of caramel, toffee, dates, figs, raisins, and wood. There's a nice bourbon aroma along with lots of vanilla. Perhaps some black cherries, red apples, and even a bit of smoke/peat.
T: Not quite as impressive as the nose, but still damn good. Lots of caramel, bourbon, oak, and apple. There's a definite smoke flavor along with some mildly tart raisins and cherries. The alcohol is more pronounced here which is really the main pitfall.
M: The body is about as full as you can get with a fairly low, but smooth carbonation.
D: A bottle of this is plenty, but a real pleasure to drink. Sort of wish I would have traded for more than one. 877 characterswomencantsail, Jan 18, 2011
4.64/5  rDev +5%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to glazeman and jamdugan for the bottles!
Poured into a Portsmouth tulip glass. Very excited to try this one. Body is a dark, murky, red-hued brown with a few patches of thin foam that float across the top. Still leaves some nice lacing on the glass.
Apple, caramel, sweet bourbon and vanilla on the nose. Oaky and chocolaty. A touch of smoke, leather and a little bit of booze. This is exceptional. An amazing aroma! Complex an decadent.
Chocolate, fudge, sweet bourbon booze and oaky vanilla on the tongue. Green apple and red grapes with just a touch of smokiness. Delicious.
Mouthfeel is rich, smooth and creamy. Perfect carbonation. Alcohol is warming, but not overdone. Body is thick without being too heavy. Perfect.
Drinkability is very good. Definitely a big beer, but I could sip on this all night. I'm amazed at how well it is already drinking. Not sure how long I'll be able to keep my other bottle in the cellar. A perfect beer for a cold winter's night. HotD has created a masterpiece. If you like stong ales, old ales, barleywines etc., this beer is a must. 1,084 characterssisuspeed, Jan 15, 2011

Looks pretty good for a strong ale. Smells absolutely delicious with a strong bourbon, caramel and slight creamy chocolate presence. Some pecans, calvados and toasted coconut as well. Really nice smells that go very well together.
Tastes fruity, smoky and slightly toasted with a nice vanilla oak richness to the malt. Sweet up front with vanilla and cacao nib. Clean lingering finish of date molasses. Boy do I like the taste! Perfect as an after dinner sipper or something to enjoy by the fire after a romp in the snow. Nice warmth after a couple sips but the alcohol is not at all assaulting. Mouthfeel is smooth with just a kiss of dryness in the middle, medium bodied and not thin but not syrupy. Not really carbonated, drinks more like a sweet digestif.
Overall I really enjoy this one. Wish I had a whole bunch of them. 932 charactersabuliarose, Jan 15, 2011

S - Sweet caramel, bready malts, with a smoky chocolate aroma. Vanilla, subtle bourbon and a little bit of fruity aroma (maybe apples).
F/M - Rich smoky caramelly chocolate malts. Apples and vanilla in the end. Dry finish with a lingering smoky vanilla flavor. Moderate bitterness with medium full body and thick, viscous mouthfeel. Adequate carbonation, but still very rich and silky.
D - This is a big time sipper. Full of absolutely delicious flavors, and thick full chewiness. Perhaps one of my favorite beers lately. Absolutely world class. 683 charactersdomtronzero, Jan 15, 2011

Pours a deep reddish brown with no head but some nice legs as I swirl it around in my glass.
Aroma is amazing and quite complex. I am getting some dark fruits, bourbon, smoke, apples, and a good bit of alcohol.
Taste starts off with some sweet dark fruits and oak then moves on to more dark fruit sweetness and smoke, and finishes quite smoky. 
Mouthfeel is thick and coats the whole mouth. There is next to no carbonation, but it's not really needed. This is incredibly smooth. Definitely a sipper and a challenging beer, almost more of a spirit than a beer. Very nice and I hope to be able to try it again someday. 716 characters321jeff, Jan 14, 2011
4.54/5  rDev +2.7%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.512 oz 2010 bottle, shared by Jeff and split in snifters
Pours a thick, still syrupy looking dark chocolate brown with almost non-existent head or lacing. Aroma is an intoxicating blend of brandy soaked apples, vanilla, molasses, brown sugar, light smoke, etc. Very complex and strong; I've never smelled a beer quite like this in depth of aroma and nuance.
Flavor is extremely sweet and fruity with a stronger smoke presence than the aroma which gives the finish a light spiciness. Mouthfeel is very lightly carbonated with a thick, velvety lush mouthfeel bordering on syrup like. Vanilla and brandy dominate the sweetness in the front of the palate and the freshness of this bottle is apparent in the finish in it's booziness. Give this another year and it'll be perfect. 774 charactersyourefragile, Jan 14, 2011

A-Copper tinted deep brown with a thin light tan head that held on strong and deposited spotty lace.
S-Fairly complex with notes of earth, oak, smoke, prune and deep malty sweetness. 
T-Very bitter up front with a strong oak character coming to the forefront. Prominent raisin/prune notes with a significant earthy hop bite and an interesting toasted coconut, dark chocolate finish.
M-Medium body, VERY dry and fairly sharp in the finish. Drying notes of oak and walnut build with warming.
D-Quite strong, very nice and certainly tasty. Alcohol heat does become present and noticeable upon warming. 651 charactersDeuane, Jan 13, 2011

Pours: Deep, dark brown with a slight red hue and a minimal tan head that quickly dissipates and leaves behind swirling tan legs. 
Nose: Can you beat it? Tobacco, slight Apple Brandy (from the barrels), peat malt (smoke), slight cherry, chocolate, oak, leather, and dark fruits. 
Taste: Same. A beautiful array of leather, chocolate, cherry, oak, vanilla, apples, and a lasting aftertaste of leather, smoke, tobacco, oak, and apple brandy.
Mouthfeel: Thick like Adam, not medicinal thick but enough to be appreciated as it coats the tongue.
Final thoughts: A beer to remember...expertly crafted by Alan Sprints. Better than Cherry Adam, I wish it was as readily available as Adam...I could drink it every day. 774 characterswaltersrj, Jan 06, 2011

Poured into a goblet and allowed to warm up for about 10 minutes.
A - Dark, mahogany brown, almost espresso like with less than a finger head that disappears.
S - Amazing. Chocolate, maple syrup, tobacco, coffee, brandy. Just super complex and really the most amazing part of this beer.
T - Smoky, maple syrup with toffee and chocolate notes. Sweet red apples and some brandy notes as well. It taste amazing, but it smells just a tad better than it tastes.
M - so carbonation, very smooth. 
D - Not too much of an alcohol burn on this one despite the 11.5% on this one. Excellent rainy day beer (exactly when I tried it - on a pouring Saturday evening in LA).
Love it fresh and can't wait to try to aged. 831 charactersteamizm, Dec 20, 2010

4.39/5  rDev -0.7%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.512 oz. bottle enjoyed at HOTD Tasting Room, $15, 12.1.2010.
Dark brown not black body, flat as a pancake no visible carbonation, minimal lacing. Nose is very complex, apple, smoke, some barrel notes, caramel, burnt brown sugar, noble hops. Taste mirrors the nose, brown sugar, plums, prunes, candy sugar, good dose of smoke as it warmed, with the ripe apple from barrels constantly present and balancing the other 'deep' flavors. Mouthfeel is medium full, good effervescence despite lack of visible carbonation, not sticky. ABV well hidden, a sipper to be sure. A very complex beer to be savored. Highly recommended.
EDIT- Shared a 2009 vintage at HOTD compliments of Dr. Will, his Ohio guest and John Michaelsen, $25, 7.27.11. The barrel aging and bottle conditioning gave this world class beer a really sublime feel, the apples were mellowed and the brown sugar had subsided. My observation at the bottom of the glass, 'this is a beer worth waiting in line to buy' says it all. Awesome, upped overall score to 4.5 from 4.0 previous review. 1,043 charactersjdense, Dec 13, 2010

A: Deep mahogany with hints of murky red at edges. Decent head for HotD, settling into a haze of fine bubbles on the surface.
S: Complex. Ripe apple, smoke, bourbon and barrel notes, tobacco leaf, continually unfolding.
T: Rich barrel notes with the bourbon a mild component. Smoke and tobacco, raisin, dates, some faint dried apple, etc. Very complex and delicious.
M: Thick but not cloying. The light carbonation refreshes as it coats.
D: I would love the opportunity and excuse to crack a couple or few of these. Alas, far too limited.
A great brew. Worthy of the hype and the HotD label. Complex and certainly to be savored. 662 charactersoregone, Dec 07, 2010
4.44/5  rDev +0.5%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured this 12oz bottle into large wine glass. It poured a blackish purple with almost no head retention. Only a little bit of non sticky lacing. The smell was overwhelming, in a good way. Lots of apple, dark fruits, pepper, sherry, and alcohol. This is an incredibly complex beer with many different flavors to pick up. Dark fruits (currants, raisins, plum), green apples very strong, tobacco and smoke, vanilla, cherries, and pleasantly black licorice. This medium to heavier body beer had alcoholic heat with a slick and semi dry mouthfeel. This beer is going to get even better with some age on it and I'm looking forward to it. A delicious, complex brew. 659 charactersOakedCanuck, Nov 30, 2010
5/5  rDev +13.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Congratulations Alan, this is a top 10 beer in the world type beer! So complex. There is obviously a little more carbonation than the Matt X and I think in two years this beer will be perfect.
Appearance- Dark, sticky, slight bubbles around the edges.
Smell- Smoke, Caramel Apples, Bourbon, Vanilla, Chocolate.
Taste- So complex. Taking small sips and allowing the beer to warm brings out more and more flavors with each sip. We noted vanilla, brown sugar, both barrel flavors were evident, but bourbon more so, a sweet syrupy chocolate body and smokiness lingers on your tongue in the finish. 
Mouthfeel- A slight bit thinner than the Matt X, but I'm guessing that a couple years of age will change that. Carbonation is a little better than the Matt X and I think this will be perfectly carbonated within one to two years. The current carbonation is actually acceptable for a beer of this viscousity.
Drinkability- Slightly hot right now. But still smooth enough to enjoy immediately. 
In closing- If you can get this beer grab some and cellar it for the next few years to come. This beer beats the pants off of other big beers I've tried like Dark Lord, Darkness, Firestone 13 etc. 1,189 charactersnorthwestmark, Nov 27, 2010
4.92/5  rDev +11.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5I first met ramnuts when I ordered a case of Sculpin and posted a thread in the North West forum inquiring "who in Portland wanted a couple bottles at cost". He was actually the first local BA to respond to the thread and the only one to give me his address to deliver the bottles. I showed up at his house with a couple bottles in hand and expected $20. He in turn gave me the $20 and a bottle each of '09 Doggie Claws and Bottleworks X Matt. My reaction was something to the tune of "no...don't...stop...murder", and proceeded to take both bottles home with me. My original plan was to review Matt as my 100th. The weekend after I hit my 99th review Cascade had Bourbonic Plague and Vlad the Imp Aler on tap. There went the whole 100th review reserved for Matt and I then planned on using it for my 200th review. Today while I was waiting in the line outside HotD for the release of the new vintage of Matt with ramnuts and my wife TulipSnifter, I decided to crack the different vintages side by side and tap out some reviews. So all back story aside, thanks Frank. Misty and I loved the hell out of our little vertical tasting tonight. On to some reviews!
Bottleworks X
A: Deep plum-brown with a small ring of sandstone froth and little bit of wispy bubbles across the cap greet me upon the pour. No lacing but none is expected. 4.5/5
S: My wife and I just went to Clear Creek Distillery yesterday and sampled their Eau de Vie which was one of the barrels Matt was aged in. I believe because of this, I can better pull out the essence of the fruit spirit. Its a rather sweet yet clean apple heat that really shines in this beer. Classic Bourbon is easily quaffable as well. Rich tobacco and leather are all over this. Fantastic. 5/5
T: Milk chocolate, more of the sweet apple heat, a lovely touch of campfire toasted marshmallow, and a hint of vanilla are all the flavors that I can easily identify coming through the rich, complex layers. The finish is long and sexy. Wow...oh...wow! This is THE definition of catching lightning in a bottle. Exquisite. 5/5
M: We have a touch of carbonation which is just enough to prickle up this super silky liqueur like drink. Residual sugars make this a bit of a sticky finisher but I do not mind in the slightest. 4.5/5
D: Simply mind blowing how easy this is to drink. I have to make a concerted effort not to drink this too fast. Its really hard not to simply drink right through my six ounces and not bother with a review. This is without a doubt my favorite HotD beer to come out of a bottle to date. Brilliant. 5/5
2010
A: This has the look of a muddied french pressed coffee with cantaloupe highlights. Those highlights extend to the thicker, darker, and denser "glass ring" of foam (when compared to the BWX) that sits above the body. Very good looking although different from its older vintaged patriarch. 4/5
S: There exists more of the aggressive bourbon essence in this beer. The leather is still there but the Apple Eau de Vie is so much harder to pick out. Still very nice. 4.5/5
T: There's the sweet apple I was looking for! Along with the apple is the unmistakable heat from the bourbon barrel as well as the wood. Sweet chocolate and vanilla are almost cloyingly strong. Hopefully a little time will help sort out the flavors better similar to BWX because right now, they're not as distinct. Still quite good. 4/5
M: Moderate feel is not as heavy as expected. A surprising amount of carbonation livens this up on the palate. Again this is a slightly sticky beer...but again I'm not complaining! 4/5
D: What an insanely wonderful beer! I'm sitting on some more for a later date. If this turns into what the BWX vintage did, its an intoxicating treat to look forward too and watch progress! If you can get only one bottle of HotD beer, Matt is the one! Try it if you can. 5/5 3,843 charactershopsbreath, Nov 21, 2010

Appearance: This vintage is dark brown. There are larger bubbles around the rim. Bubbles dissipate. Looks pretty heavy.
Smell: The smell is sweet but not overpowering. There is a little bit of a bourbon smell but there is no alcohol burn.
Taste: A little smoke, some bourbon, and quite a bit of sweet caramel. Very smooth.
Mouthfeel: Heavy body, lightly carbonated, but very smooth.
Drinkability: Very nice and easy to drink. 
2010 Matt
Appearance: Dark brown with a ring of tiny bubbles that stay intact.
Smell: Very vibrant. I smell some apple and a little more heat than the Bottleworks vintage, not bad though. I guess the alcohol smell has tamed with the age of the older vintage. 
Taste: Absolutely wonderful. Apple, sweet with a little heat, and the perfect amount of smoke. There is a little bite but nothing time won't take care of.
Mouthfeel: Carbonated! Lighter, crisper, and very fun to drink. It seems to have a little more bite because it's still young but some aging will probably take care of that if you want it a little smoother.
Drinkability: Great! It doesn't feel so heavy right now at this stage. The lighter, thinner feel makes it easier to drink but you will probably be able to get more nuances once you let it settle for a while. Both are still wonderful. Matt is wonderful! 1,317 charactersTulipSnifter, Nov 21, 2010
4.64/5  rDev +5%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5To start, YIKES! This beer is just so, oh so good. I have had the 2009 vintage three times. Unfortunately I had missed it on tap during Zwickelmania of 2009. But I had it the first time just a couple months after the initial bottle release. Again at the 16th anniversary dock sale, and just recently a third time. 
After about a year and a half, the carbonation has subtly taking affect, and the brandy barrel aged qualities have created a nice dominance.
A near black pour with a thin khaki head. Smelled of booze and smoked grains. Soft, low bodied palate. Smokey and robust with a red meat character. Dark fruits and big cherry and caramel apple notes. Low bitterness but with noticeable alcohol flavors similar to port wine. Finished spicy with a smoked liqueur flavor. 775 charactersboMD, Nov 15, 2010
4.62/5  rDev +4.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5OK, I finally decided to crack open my last bottle of this now that it is nearing 2 years of age. I reviewed this over a year ago (original review text and update below), and I felt that it was a beer that was on the verge of greatness but didn't quite get there because of a watery flatness. Upon pouring my latest bottle, I was still greeted with no head and it appeared that not much had changed. However, once it hit my palate the SLIGHTEST bit of carbonation was present, and boy did it make a world of difference. This beer is now exactly what I thought it could be. A world class barrel treatment on an already world class beer. I don't think there is much room for improvement now either, as the alcohol heat is warming but not distracting and the flavors mesh extremely well. If you are still holding onto a bottle, drink it now and be in for a treat.

Can't believe I got this as an extra....thanks Derek!
Pours near black in color, I gave it a pretty hard pour and didn't really even manage to get the slightest of heads, although a collar of bubbles did rise eventually.
Apples are the first thing that comes out in the smell, with a wave of oak/bourbon rushing in behind it. Massive, boozy nose on this one, but luckily no rubbing alcohol heat to go with it. The slightest hint of fudge and caramel in the background.
Very odd and unique flavor here, a product of the unique barrel aging used to make it I'm sure. Complex as hell....with chocolate, apple skin, bourbon, oak, vanilla, and alcohol heat being the most recognizable (not in that order though...this one is pretty hot). I think this one would benefit from a bit more carbonation, it is amazing but doesn't quite mesh together enough to get a 5.
Mouthfeel is fairly flat and medium bodied. More carbonation could make this one of the best beers I've ever had.
At this high of alcohol content and having this much booziness, drinkability is fairly low in terms of volume of beer...but this is just so complex and challenging that I can't put the glass down and I am seeing it disappear before my eyes.
Update 8/31: I have not stopped thinking about this beer since I drank it. Originally, I submitted a 4.2 A- rating (changed the drinkability to a 5 on this update), but I want to stress that the ONLY reason this didn't get an A+ was the lack of carbonation. The flatness played a factor in every characteristic of the beer....but what I drank unquestionably had the potential to be one of the best beers ever to grace my lips. I now have a couple more bottles that I will crack down the line....and I am holding out hope that one of them has even a smidgen of carbonation so I can experience the true beauty of this beer. 2,742 charactersalcstradamus, Oct 16, 2010

appearance - dark and oily, not much head or lacing
smell - smoke, tobacco, apple, brandy
taste - hugely complex but carefully crafted, smooth notes of smoke, tobacco, apple, brandy, sugar and malts individually punch the senses
mouthfeel - thick and smooth, light carbonation (just right)
drinkability - what an amazing beer to try, complex, unimaginable, creative, one of the more memorable beers i've had 603 charactersdjbreezy, Sep 19, 2010
4.94/5  rDev +11.8%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Served in a bottle and poured into a tulip snifter at the Hair of the Dog tasting room.
A - virtually black; when held up to the light, the edges appear a murky brown, like an old, leather chair.  No head or lacing to speak of.
S - smoke, bourbon, and apple are dominant -- a wonderful, liquor-like aroma.  Very enticing.
T - malt, molasses, and bourbon whiskey up front, with an apple finish that makes for a very smooth and balanced flavor. The bourbon becomes more prominent as the glass progresses, but never too boozey.
M - very little carbonation -- creamy and smooth.  Full-bodied, but not quite syrupy.  Pretty much perfect for the style.
D - not meant to be consumed in excess, this beer is exactly as drinkable as it ought to be -- sip, appreciate, and lose yourself in this masterfully-crafted brew. 819 charactersElendinn, Aug 30, 2010
4.47/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Chilled bottle into a glass. A very generous gift from the ever-awesome ramnuts. Thanks so much, Frank.
A: Pours an oily, impenetrable black in the glass, although lightening at the edges shows that it's a translucent mahogany-chestnut color. Great shade. It has low carbonation, with just a half-finger of light brown head and milky swirls adorning the brew. No lace; none really expected. 
S: Green apple, tobacco, leather, smoke -- it's even peaty. Rum-soaked raisins, oak, earth, and a touch of chocolate. 
T: Apple, from the brandy barrels; lots of tobacco, leather, and smoke up front. Peat-like, giving an overall impression of scotch. Rummy raisins, oak, vanilla, bourbon/caramel (relatively restrained against the apple brandy). Reminds me of cognac in parts. The finish is lightly hot with the spirit components really coming out in an apple-bourbon-brown sugar blend. Breathing out afterward is all tobacco and leather -- again, peat comes to mind. 
M: Massively full-bodied. Tough to swirl around in the mouth, it's so thick. Carbonation is quite low, but it accentuates the flavors. It's a bit underattenuated, or at least it seems to taste sweeter than Cherry Adam. Still, excellent. 
D: This is a perfect special occasion beer. I slightly prefer Cherry Adam to this one, but Matt is definitely up there. 1,323 charactersArbitrator, Aug 18, 2010
4.82/5  rDev +9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours black with a large creamy light brown head that takes a very long time to recede. When it finally recedes it leaves a generous amount of lacing on the glass.
Lots of apple brandy, smoke, and peat. There's a nice level of apple brandy character from the barrels. Belgian candied sugar is prominent, as well as tobacco and leather. I'm not a smoker, yet I feel like I should be holding a fine cigar.
The alcohol heat is prominent but really complements the complexities of Matt. Peat, smoke, apple brandy, and tobacco combine for a stellar sensory sensation. Subtle oak notes and chocolate round out the complex flavor, as well as sweet Belgian candied sugar. The booziness is more apparent in the finish, but not as prominent as in the bottled version. Notes of apple, smoke, chocolate, and peat linger on my palate for a very long time, as well as some sweetness.
Full bodied with a medium level of carbonation. The beer has a low level of carbonation.
Simply amazing. Undoubtedly my favorite Hair of the Dog beer.
Another bottled consumed on 11/6/2009 with dyan and largadeer and poured into a snifter:
The beer has shown a drastic increase in carbonation. It's at a perfect upper low level of carbonation and I couldn't ask for more from the style. The increased carbonation makes for an improved head and presentation. Booziness has died down to a perfect level. I can't imagine this beer getting better. It's wonderful right now.
Changes:
Appearance +.5
Taste +.5
Mouthfeel +.5
Bottle consumed 6/30/2010
This has been aging at 55 degrees since the release and it continues to improve, displaying a beautiful balance of apple brandy, leather, smoke, chocolate, and tobacco. This is aging wonderfully. 1,717 charactersHopHead84, Jul 14, 2010

A-Pours a murky dark brown, with very mild carbonation. Some bubbles but no head or lacing. That's ok with me for this style.
S-Awesome aromas. Brown sugar, bourbon, vanilla provide the sweet notes with an undertone of molasses and a bit of leather.
T-Taste is equally deep and complex. Caramel and vanilla, raisins and brandy with some peatiness as well. Excellent. Alcohol is, amazingly, well hidden.
M-Nicely rich and tongue coating. The light carbonation really works well here.
D-Could have had more, grateful to have shared one.

4.25/5  rDev -3.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4This was consumed during Lakers-Celtics game 6 tasting. This beer flew under my radar on terms of hype and buzzworthy beers, but my buddy James got hold of one and shared it. Good beer, different and well crafted. 
The bottle opens with no pop or fizz, just silence. It pours with some tan bubbles, but they leave fast. The beer is colored pretty dark, has a dark leather brown heart with lighter cocoa edges. 
It smells of sweet apple, brown sugar, booze, oak. 
The beer is perfectly carbonated for the tastes. It has a very low carbonation, but because of the strong liquor tastes it blends everything perfectly. Great base beer, with hints of brown sugar, alcoholic booze, strong notes of apple brandy and bourbon, oak and earth. The barrel is great, not too strong but still very much there. The apple brandy threw me for a little bit of a loop, it is obviously apple and it almost stands out like a sore thumb from the rest of the flavors. Great blending from the brewers though for it is balanced very well. 
Mouthfeel for an Old Ale/Strong Ale is perfect. Little carbonation that lets the flavors blend well. Delicious sipper of a beer that should be enjoyed by whoever gets the chance.

4.84/5  rDev +9.5%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 512 oz bottle, Bottleworks X (2009) had at Brouwer's on 5/20/10.
Bottle pours super dark brown with very little head; a slight slick of oil floating on the surface. No head whatsoever.
Aroma was incredibley complex: Vanilla, slight smoke, cherry and dark grape, molasses and brandy.
Flavor was even better with a beautiful rich caramel molasses sweetness with some slightly tart fruit and a bitter smoky roasted finish.
Mouthfeel was a super thick oil with hardly any carbonation, but I prefer it this way. I could sip on this for hours.
Overall, this was an incredibly complex beer with so much going on. At the same time, it is a single cohesive brew that is the epitome of barrel aging and blending. This is easily one of the best beers I have ever had and is worth the hype. I will for sure have another the next time I'm in Seattle. 841 charactersChrisPro, Jun 07, 2010

Huge thanks for Josh (alleykatking) for sharing this long time want with me at DLD. Review from voice recorder. 
Poured into Duck Rabbit snifter.
Pours very little head. What is there is a light tan. Color is a deep robust mahogany brown with a ruby hue to it. Very nice looking beer.
Aroma: Rich and sweet. Some booze off the top with brandy showing, but hotd makes a person enjoy it since it isn't so hot. Lots of dark dried fruits here. Plums, raisins, and black cherries present. A decent amount of oak showing well. Has some sweet malts that bring a caramel flavor to the table. I am really enjoying this one.
Taste: In the taste I get some chocolate that I didn't pick up as much in the nose. The wood and brandy flavors show predominately but well done. Again, lots of dark dried fruits here. A lot more the plums showing for me. Sweet and malty with caramel. Finally, as it warms I get some tobacco flavors that add yet another layer to this beer.
Mouthfeel: Very warming and smooth. I enjoy how HotD makes beers of this style that the abv shows, but in a good way. Medium to full bodied with a lower amount of carbonation.
Overall, this was a definite treat to have. Lots of great flavors here and they all worked well with each other. The barrels that were used were awesome, but really didn't detect very much of the apple flavors. Thanks Josh for sharing this one! It was very drinkable!
Update: 2013 bottle notes 4.45 score
Oak,  molasses, smokey, apples, chocolate, vanilla, toffee, caramel. An old ale at it's finest. 1,571 charactersmothman, Jun 02, 2010
4.57/5  rDev +3.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Big thanks to Masterski for breaking out this bottle last night. This beer has been on my "want list" for quite some time and Alex was kind enough to break out this gem while we waited for his wife to return home.
Even after making a joke about an aggressive pour, Alex could not coax any sort of head on this beer. As close as he came is few wispy bubble on top of the pour. The beer was a dull brown color which did allow light in along the edges. Reminded me of a dark brown shoe leather. Certainly no lacing to be found.
Aroma was quite nice. Brown Sugar, vanilla and certainly a sense of the alcohol. In both the aroma and flavor there was quite a bit of fruit, but I'm not sure I would have picked out apple had I not known that this was aged in Calvados barrels. In either case, fruit was present and the aroma overall was excellent.
The flavor is a wonderful blend of the elements noted in the aroma plus a delicate smoked nature. The sense of smoke is not center stage and plays a role in adding to the complexity. However, this in no way tastes like a "smoked beer" The fruit, vanilla and brown sugar all meld to provide a wonderful flavor with a great deal of depth. Quite a bit going on here. While you can sense the abv, I would never guess this was as high as 11.5%. No heat from the alcohol.
Alex and I joked about the subtle carbonation. If there is a level just above "no carbonation" this is where this beer resides. A tiny pin prick. Medium bodied and definitely oily on the tongue.
I loved this beer and will have it remain on my want list. I'd love the chance to try this again. Excellent beer.
Thanks Alex. 1,634 charactersReagan1984, May 12, 2010
4.56/5  rDev +3.2%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to tthomas for sending this to me many moons ago. I've had sips of this one a few different times, but it was time to crack my own bottle with Reagan1984 in town visiting. Served in a Darkness snifter.
A - Pours, with no visible carbonation. Somehow even avoids the big bubbles you get with other still beers like Bon-Chien Grand Cru or Lambicus Dexterius. However, after a little bit a few spots of lace appear on the sides of the glass and a faint wisp appears on the surface of the beer. Perhaps there is a hint of carbonation after all. The color is a dark woody brown color, but shows transparency when held to the light.
S - The initial smell is quite sweet and fruity, filled with sugar and apple brandy. There are also notes of smoked malt, and slight sherry-like oxidation. Bourbon adds a hint of vanilla, but is otherwise quite understated.
T - Taste is similarly excellent, with initial brown sugar and apple sweetness mixed with sweet liquors that slowly dissolve into light smoke and barrel tannins. Wonderfully integrated, without any dissonant juxtaposition between the many flavors. Flavor profile is reminiscent some of better Kuhnhenn brews. Surprisingly mellow for Hair of the Dog. Both taste and smell were closer to 4.75 for me so I bumped up feel and smell a notch each to make it work out.
M - There is slight carbonation - take note Tomme Arthur. This is about as low as it can be before it is still, but that slight bit makes all the difference. Thick oily body, with surprisingly little heat.
D - I was very tempted to drink Bryna's 4oz before she got home. This is one of the few Hair of the Dog beers where I actually could down a whole bottle on my own. The year has done wonders to take the boozy edge of this, and none of the potentially overbearing flavors get out of control. Highly recommended. 1,840 charactersMasterSki, May 12, 2010
4.7/5  rDev +6.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Split a bottle of this with Mothman at DLD. Oddly enough split another bottle later the next week with a buddy who brough it over. Review from notes....
A- Poured a black looking color. When held to the light you could see that it was a murky brown color. Little half finger light tan head pops up and dies just a quickly. Light light specks of lace on the sides of the glass.
S- This one has a huge apple almost brandy like aroma when it's popped. Light smokey malts in the backing mixes with a chocolate sweetness. Oak notes blend with a light bourbon burn in the nose. As this warms vanilla notes come out as well along with some sugared darker fruits. 
T- This is a holy shit beer! A beer that you take a sip of and just say "holy shit!". Everything in the nose transfer to the palate perfect. Big brown sugary apple front on this. The middle of the beer dies down to oaky bourbon flavors with a hint of vanilla. The smokey ending on this mixing with some lighter darker fruits is a fantastic ending to this beer. Everything taste wise is just wow....amazing. It's hard to describe!
M- Medium heavy mouthfeel. Carbonation was a little lacking on the beer but still made it ok. Lighty chewy with some sips. It's kind of hard to describe the flaovrs left behind because everything is so well blended yet can be picked out. The alcohol warmed the throat and dryed the palate but in a clean way and not overly harsh. 
D- This beer is great. Hair of the Dog knocks another one out of the park! This beer both times I have had it has been divine. It is a smooth sipper and I could drink on it all night like that. 1,616 charactersalleykatking, May 01, 2010
4.77/5  rDev +7.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5I didn't think I'd ever try this one, so thanks Steve. selfishly I'm keeping this specialty to myself. I'm not even wasting the time chilling this one. Served at around room temp.
A- pours extremely dark. it seemed like a murky brown while pouring but in the glass it just looks black. when held to light it shows some nice burgandy like colours around the edges. the little bit of sand colored head reduced to a thin collar quite quickly. it's expected with a beer at this strength, especially after spending a while in barrels
S- the barrels are play a huge role in this one. the apple brandy really shines through the most though. there is so much going on in this beer but it's not a "mess" as a lot of beers with this much going on end up being. apple brandy and bourbon, woody and earthiness, the sweetness mixes with the lingering apple and almost smells a bit tart. there is also some light smokiness and chocolate. seriously probably one of the most complex aromas from a beer I've experienced.
T- the chocolate really got masked by the barrels in the nose too much, as it seems almost center stage at the front of this beer. it quickly melds into a load of different flavors. some sweet vinous flavors mix with the chocolate and finally some of that apple brandy that was so prevalent in the nose. the barrels really do most the work in the finish. woody, apple brandy and bourbon mix, and a substantial smokiness that mixes very well with the spirits. it seems like none of the flavors completely fade away and at the end it's just a fantastic mix of everything. and while staying on the sweet side throughout it's nowhere near cloying and has more bitterness than I expected. this stuff is so seriously good. 
m- maybe the only non standout part of the beer. the viscosity is substantial though. the carbonation is borderline low but I think if it was much higher it likely wouldn't feel "right" 
d- I will finish this 12oz serving in a very timely manner. it's a sipper, but it's so good that the sips are frequent and consistent. the big flavors didn't weigh on me as much as I thought they would, either.
after reading some of the earlier reviews, I think the year in the bottle has really done good for the "hotness" of this one. while their was a good amount of boozy flavors from the bourbon and apple brandy it didn't come off as just alcohol. the spirits seemed well defined, flavorful and were very enjoyable 2,435 charactersFreethyhops, Apr 24, 2010
4.44/5  rDev +0.5%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Huge thanks to Jason for this! Served around 50º in a Duvel tulip. 
Deep mahogany brown, with a burgundy red glint when backlit. At first it looked like there was no carbonation, then larger bubbles formed, and a subsequent skim crept up along the rim. Clumps of larger bubbles hung to the edge, creating a ringed collar around the outside. Flecks of spotty snowflake lace were left, pretty nice considering the high abv. 
Aroma was like an Oud Bruin at first, vinous, wet wood & funk, then a wave of fruit crept in... black cherry, currants, muted oak spice. 
Flavors of cherry skins, bitter unsweetened dark chocolate, and raspberry truffle upfront. Grand marnier and cherry skin aftertaste, fading into leather and red wine traces. Feel is full and supple, not much tangible carbonation. Very rich and sippable, fairly hidden abv. 
Overall this was really unique and impressive, with so much layered complexity. Here's to 10 more years... 946 charactersemerge077, Mar 03, 2010
4.87/5  rDev +10.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5I'm glad I ordered Matt without asking how much it cost. Surely I enjoyed it more without knowing I was about to pay $18 for a single 12-oz. bottle. 
But since Matt was brewed in honor of the two Matts who own Bottleworks and Brouwer's, it seemed appropriate to drink it at Brouwer's. And though I eventually endured some sticker shock, I have no regrets about drinking this beer. It's one of the best beers on the planet. 
The smell alone is sublime, projecting notes of apple cured chewing tobacco, cherries, port wine and plum. The flavor blends notes of licorice, fig, vanilla, molasses, and woodsmoke while a distant glow of alcohol adds an ideal measure of heat. Just the thought of this exotic and seductive, motor oil-black ale has me drifting into a state of beer bliss. I can't imagine how high the gravity must have been to ferment out at 11.5% ABV while still retaining a plush body and considerable sweetness. But this is a rock solid beer that exceeds ordinary comparisons. It's pure magic. 1,008 charactersRedDiamond, Mar 01, 2010

Pours black with a little light at the edges. No real head formation but some dotted lace on the glass with even a little wine-like legs coating the glass. 
Wow apples are surprisingly potent. The barrels really did some work here. Other fruits too... maybe cherry? The smoked malt adds a really nice complement with some dark chocolate. Of course there is some brandy-ish booze present through the back. 
The taste starts with some of the sweeter fruit flavors and dark chocolate and malts but quickly segues to a boozy finish. Smoke was a little more standout in the aroma, but is more integrated here. This beer is definitely warming and its ABV is apparent. 
Having said that, the complexity is there and this would make for a really nice sipper. Very low carbonation, but not flat. Medium bodied with a good substance to it. Both the booze and flavor profile command small sips... oh yeah and the price tag and it's availability. Glad I got to try it, but probably won't seek it out again in the future. I bet it will age nicely though. 1,174 charactersIneedabeerhere, Feb 26, 2010

3.12/5  rDev -29.4%look: 3 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3 |  overall: 2Shared the night before ebf by Joe, with the renegades of funk. It pours a very dark brown with no head except for some bubbles on the side.
The aroma is very strong and includes a touch of alcohol. It has some strong fruit notes from the yeast as well as some apple character from the barrels. This apple character dominates and has a roasty malt back. Slight smoke, but I didn't seem to pick it up as much as the others did.
The taste is hot with a boozy, burning finish. It has some brandy like warmth to it. Slight cherry like acidity as well as licorice, maple, and some subtle smoke. On the palate, its very lowly carbonated and has a syrupy, liqueur type consistency, and an over the top burn from the alcohol. I didn't feel like finishing my sample, so I shared it with people who appreciated it more. 811 charactersjeffthecheff, Feb 21, 2010

Pours a moderate shade of brown, somewhere between strong iced tea and cola, and quite viscous. Defined layers of separation within the liquid. Huge alcohol is apparent in the look - the slight, slippery lace slides through a viscous layer of alcohol on the glass. Sediment hangs suspended in the liquid, barely letting light through. 
Full of malty sweetness and strong alcoholy esters, dark sticky fruit, in a literal taffy sticky sweetness, caramel, toffee, slight cocoa from roast. Bit of metallic, bloody iron. 
Alcohol is a hot punch int he mouth. Meatiness, rare bloody iron oxides, dark fruits and chocolate/caramel malt are present, but barely under the harshness of the esters. Feel is moderate, viscous, oily and slick. 
Phew - this one is hot and strong, no such thing as balance in Matt. 962 characterskels, Jan 30, 2010

Dark tan head... murky deep walnut brew... not really cloudy, but very dark brown. okay retention with pretty descent lacing.
Nose is very complex... light smoke.. barrel presence is nice and adds tons to the overall product.. dark fruits, bing cherry essence and raisins.. really appreciate the mild yet inviting apple brandy component.
WOW!! Flavor is massive.. dark fruits come in waves.. cherries... prunes.. golden raisins.. then dark malts are medium mainly comprised of some chocolate... a bit of sweetness seems to carry the entire palate... vanilla and good bourbon... again, the apple essence is there and adds a bunch to the complexity... smoke is present for sure from front to back, but is far enough in the background to again just add a fantastic layer ... sorta leathery .. 
Great medium/full body with a lite but certainly present carbonation... 
Jesus... reading/writing this review makes me want to go grab another bottle.... but this is a work of art that deserves to be shared... I haven't clicked "review" yet, but this is going to be one of my top beers probably... I think this has aging potential pushing a decade.

thin off-white head with some collections of big, solid bubbles lay on top of a dark brown body. head turns to a marbled paper look after a few minutes. 
["oh! i had a good bubble pop!"]
smell immediately reminds me of the coffee roast / chocolate / barrel-ness of kbs. the coffee component is sweet. vanilla, lightly smoky, lots of thin-skinned fruits picked out here--cherries, apples, grapes. there are aspects of both artificial and natural cherry flavors.
taste is super smoky, super vinous. cherry tartness. flavors of both fermented and fresh grapes. sweet, vanilla, woody. the sweetness hangs on for dear life on the tongue and builds up til the last drop. quite evident but there is too much battling the sweetness for it to be cloying.
mouthfeel is super smooth, slightly acidic and drying. pleasant.

A: Pours a maple brown with ruby edges and a light covering of big bubbles (even after a vigorous pour). You can see the viscosity in the pour. Light retention throughout. 
S: Smell starts off mild and opens up big as it warms. Aromas of vinous oak, fresh vanilla bean, tannic cherry pits, and mesquite smoke.
T: Taste follows suit, but the flavor is so much more pronounced than the smell. Beautiful melding of sweet vanilla, brown sugar, cherries, vinous wood, and rich dark malts all wrapped up in a mesquite (and slightly meaty) smoke blanket. It's like a brown sugar glazed wood-smoked ham. Okay not that meaty, but you get the point.
M: Full bodied, rich and creamy with low carbonation...but it works perfectly with the flavor profile.
D: I split this bottle and after enjoying another big beer, and wanted more. 
I will definitely be seeking this out again. 946 charactersbeavers, Jan 23, 2010

A - Poured a dark walnut brown body with slight reddish hues and a thin sliver of bubbly head on top.
S - Opens with a warm alcohol presence, burnt caramel malt and sugary character. Aroma is quite woody with lots of caramel/toffee notes, a hint of licorice and toasted coconut, the latter of which was a pleasant surprise. 
T - Initial flavor is quite malty with caramel, marshmallow and butterscotch notes. Subtle boozy alcohol notes creep into the mix midway through, followed by a delicious tosted coconut character paired with chocolate notes in the backend. Finishes with plenty of earthy bitterness.
M - Medium to full-bodied with a thick, smooth and creamy texture and a slight oily feel. Moderate bitter notes encapsulate the tongue in the finish.
D - Matt's got a lot going on, including plenty of malt goodness and a pleasant toasted coconut character that took me by surprise. Good stuff fo' sho'. 1,012 charactersffejherb, Dec 31, 2009
4.59/5  rDev +3.8%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Huge thanks to Derek (hoppymeal) for throwing this in as an extra. Derek, you're probably getting tired of all of the praise you get on here, but you are a class act my friend. 
This beer looks interesting, very stout like. A little bit thin and very oily. I'd prefer a head, but I think the lack thereof is due in part to some missing carbonation. I won't hold it against this one. 
The scent and taste on this are near world class. There's this funky milkiness that adds to the awesomeness of this one. There's a beautiful cola taste... Alright, I need to cut to the chase. There's in an incredibly unique smokey characteristic that is (excuse my ebonics) da bomb. The bourbon notes are phenomenal, truely magnificent. So smooth with that crunchy caramel flavor. Lovely vanilla, and light apple brandy tastes make this beer both one of a kind and amazing. I wish I had more. 878 charactersCoolJosh, Dec 29, 2009

Wish I could remember who shared it but thanks. Nice flavor and was to be expected from HOTD . nice smoke malt presence and flavors from Belgian yeast coming through. Malty and sweet and a dangerous 11.5% ALC. Some slight apple flavor coming through with a candi sugar sweetness on a malty base. Good stuff. 392 charactershrking, Dec 29, 2009
3.92/5  rDev -11.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3 |  overall: 3.5Thanks to gregc for the bottle.
12oz. brown bottle poured into a large snifter.
A: Very deep, woody brown, ruddy and opaque. Short head on a somewhat rough pour with only a bit of retention. Some oily coating on the glass with plenty of little bubbles of lacing.
S: Deep rich malts with a cooked fig dark fruit thing in the back. Lots of nice, full alcohol that may have mellowed a bit but seems like it could age great. Lots of woody, dank barrel, rich. A metallic or alkaline smell in the back, maybe like blood. Maybe a bit of tobacco.
T/M: Rich malts with lots of solventy alcohol. Some dark raisins that are overpoweringly soaked with rum and scotch. Alcohol is out of control. Some woody notes try to come through and there is a touch of tobacco and metal/blood in the back but it barely escapes the alcohols wrath. Body is medium to medium like with lower carbonation... from all the alcohol.
D: Very interesting idea and probably will get better down the road but this is almost a mess. Very tasty flavors that are being covered up by the raw alcohol. Wouldn't have guessed 11.5% from the nose but it actually seems like more in the taste. I actually warmed up to the beer a bit more the more that I drank. The alcohol mellows a touch as it opens up further and you get a bit of raw, meaty, smoked meat flavor in the back, adding some nice depth. Mix that with the wood. 1,383 characterspwoods, Dec 13, 2009
4.52/5  rDev +2.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5On tap during the big wood festival at brouwers.
The beer pours the expected dark brown color with good head retention and lacing. The nose is as intense on tap as it was out of the bottle, with prunes, apple brandy, licorice, chocolate and coffee. As the beer warmed (I really think they were serving this beer too cold at Brouwers) I got additional chocolate, as well as some more apple and vanilla. Flavors replicate the nose, except this beer really smoothed out and became very creamy after it warmed a bit. I actually found it a bit astringent and angular initially, but with time and warming, the beer dramatically improved. As with the bottle version, the mouthfeel is very rich and full, and was just exceptional once it warmed a bit. Drinkability is pretty good, though the alcohol and sweetmess really make this a sipper. Also, after having this both in bottle and on tap, I really think this beer needs time to show it's very best. It's delicious now, but I think in a year or two, will turn into a real gem. Regardless, this is a very impressive beer from HOTD. 1,075 charactersJohn_M, Dec 04, 2009

4.64/5  rDev +5%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Big ups to Vorlagen for trading me this one. 
Pours a very deep but clear brown with no head whatsoever. Very small patch of bubbles. Nice legs. Note that this was poured much colder than it should have been.
Despite the temperature, the room filled with the scent of boozy apple brandy as soon as the cap was popped. As it warmed, scents of vanilla, oak, butter, brown sugar and tobacco came out. Wonderful stuff.
Flavor is complex and amazingly tasty. Lots of apple and vanilla flavors. Slightly buttery and woody with some tobacco and wet leaf flavors. All kinds of character from the barrels is present, with bourbon taking the back seat to the apple eau de vie. Why isn't more stuff aged in apple brandy/eau de vie barrels?? Very smooth with a nice heat to it. I get the feeling that this is going to peak in the next 3-6 months or so. Incredibly tasty.
Mouthfeel is perfect. Slick and oily without being overly full-bodied with light effervescent carbonation. Viscous but not chewy.
I never wanted this beer to end. Astounding stuff. One of my all time favorites. 1,074 charactersphotomike, Nov 29, 2009
4.64/5  rDev +5%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Been wanting to crack this bottle for a long time.
Pours a very dark brown in color. A very vigorous pour gives some bubbling and a slight reverse cascading head as well. The vigorous pour releases an absolutely wonderful bouquet of a nose. 
Smell is malty. Plenty of oak, brandy, dark fruit and heaven in the nose.
Taste is more of the same. Plenty of barrel aged goodness. Lots of brandy, oak, some slight vanilla and charred flavors as well. There's a bit of fruit coming through as well.
I was worried about the lack of carbonation that appeared on the pour, but it's perfect for this beer. It's there and it's just enough. Super viscosity and thickness that coats the side of the glass. Very full and smooth in the mouthfeel as well. I could drink this everyday. Must seek out more bottles of this, it's that good.
If you have the chance, it's worth the effort of tracking this one down. 892 charactersFtownThrowDown, Nov 25, 2009
4.4/5  rDev -0.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 412oz bottle at 55 degrees.
Pours dark mahogany, with translucent edging, and a reluctant ascention of the tiniest bubbles ever seen in a beer. Very nitrogen-like in appearance, with a quarter inch head of biege that finally revealed itself after an exagerated pour. A partial skim coat remained for the duration as well as smeary lacing.
Aromatics lead off with fudge-smeared leather, burnt tobacco, dark chocolate, bourbon, and Kahlua-soaked figs. Shades of dark rum, toasted raisin, apple skins, and brandy follow through.
Full bodied with a slick, oily mouthfeel. An oil spill on crushed velvet.
The palate is lush, decadent, rich, and complex. A melange of chocolate syrup, brandy, char, old leather, bourbon, smoke, and rum-soaked figs. 
Finishes with lingering burnt caramel, boozy undertones, and fudge bits.
Quite a beer. Definately in my top 5 strong ale/Barleywines.
Sweetish, boozy, and strong. A real sipper. 926 charactersbrewandbbq, Nov 11, 2009

Aromas of dark malts, apple and a nice smoke character with chocolate accents. A lovely melange of scents coming off of this one...rich, great depth, awesome.
First sip brings rich dark malts with smoke flavors. Chocolate and dark fruits abound and intertwine with each subsequent sip. Caramel and licorice accents. A bit of an oaky barrel on the way down. Immensely tasty.
Smooth, medium body that's not overly heavy. Just an incredibly tasty brew that is a great treat and thanks to Scott for graciously sharing this one at a tasting at my house. Would love to have it again someday. 681 charactersorbitalr0x, Oct 31, 2009

Apple, oak, bourbon, red currants, date and caramel, smokey with other dried pitted fruit aromas. Amazingly complex and arousing.
One of the better beers I've every tried. What i really like is just the style with the barrel aging and the complexity and depth of the beer. The apple comes throgh with some berry type flavors a lingering smokiness and chewy caramel date nougat on the forever finish. Hints of milk chocolate, red currant, pitted fruits and a bit of toffee.

IIRC, this is a blend of apple brandy barrel-aged adam and a bourbon barrel aged strong belgian style ale... er, or something like that.
i have a sixer of these left, they're six months old, therefore it's time to test one out.
the beer pours dark, not much head exists but enough to know the beer has bubbles. a spidery wisp sits atop the brew. nose is huge.. it's salty, oaky and leathery with equal parts bourbon and sherry. with warmth, i pick up honey crisp apples and tobacco. first sip is viscous as a dark lord, perceptually.. but not really. the body is thinner. the flavor is bigger though. first is the apple brandy.. totally noticeable in the first sip. understandably so a huge booze rush follows. the beer finishes with chocolate and cherry notes, a hint of smoke, and a lingering finish which harkens back to the tobacco element. 
how many words have i used to describe this beer? i'd be hard-pressed to answer 'enough' given the continued complexity of the liquid i'm sampling. this beer brings beer to a higher level. this beer justifies the inflated bottle price. this beer is one of the few that can claim to deliver a depth of flavor which matches top-shelf spirits and $800 bottles of wine.

4.22/5  rDev -4.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 412 oz. bottle, one of a modest amount I picked up at the 'Earth Day' Dock Sale last April; it's held down the back corner of the fridge since then, patiently awaiting tonight. A nice day of late-summer warmth and office-sponsored golf (the par-3 course at Edgefield) ends in a snifter-sized pour of Matt as a nightcap.
A: Brackish ebony, a deep and dark murkiness that at first seems a bit lifeless, then magically springs to life with a roil of carbonation and a gauzy swirl of tan film. Creamy rim-hugging band and small flecks dot the glass. Held to light late in the pour, there's plenty of dusty detritus hanging around.
S: Aroma of cocoa and caramel-wrapped apples, a sweetness like maraschino cherry, with a hint of tartness (lime?). Dried tobacco amidst a bourbon char. Hops are there, but are hard to distinguish behind drippy malts. Full and fragrant, smell-able from 3 feet away.
T: In the same way the appearance was dull for the first few seconds, so the flavor was an abrupt turn-off. Then a creeping, coating chocolate, followed by molasses and a grape-like fruitiness. Barrel oak follows, a charred vanilla and a dose of herbal hops. Ends a little 'off' for me, an odd medicinal (cough syrup) backing.
M: Fantastic mouthfeel from the start: luscious, chewy, fully coating. Enough warmth, without bragging about its 11.5% alcohol too boisterously. Lip-smacking malts, carbonation is there - but where? 
D: Tough call here: an amazing brew, replete with varied flavors and tantalizing aromas. Will I have this again? Fortunately, yes. Will I place this in my upper echelon of 'must trys'? Certainly. Is it 'drinkable'? Well, that's debatable; definitely a wonderful sipper, but a few ounces go a long way. Find a lover of fine beer and share a bottle... 1,772 charactersmsubulldog25, Sep 16, 2009

Poured into my Westy chalice a thick black color, some carbonation, really no head, but there is some oil slicks left behind. The nose is malty, with lots of bourbon/whiskey notes, some chocolate as well. The taste is malty, sweet, lots of bourbon/whiskey notes, and a nice touch of chocolate, a slight tartness/sour note. Full body, the second I opened the bottle I got a good whiff of the bourbon/whiskey, ABV is there, but not to up front. Very drinkable, this one is definitely a sipper, does go down smoothly.

4.3/5  rDev -2.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Big thanks go's out to JohnGalt1 for the bottle. You rock tobes!
Pours a deep blackish brown with some ruby highlights, but cannot see through it. A light tan watery head is produced by a vigorous pour and retains for a couple minutes leaving minute lacing.
Nose is very complex. Huge bourbon barrely notes, some apple, and an almost flemish tartness come out in the nose.
Wow. A very tasty beer. Big chew malty sweetness. Great bourbony alcohol and huge vanilla oak notes. Not catching alot of the apple, but it is there. A uniquely dry finish for a beer of this magnitude and style. There is a noticeable hop bitterness on the finish, and any hop flavor actually shows up the most in the aftertaste. Flavors linger FOREVER after each sip. Magnificent barrel aging.
Mouthfeel is FANTASTIC on this beer. A nice creamy chew viscous feel REALLY strikes the right chord with this brew. Excellent. Carbonation seems odd, and typical of previous HOTD issues on the poor, BUT a head does rise if it is summoned hard enough, and on the palate the carbo is right where it should be for this beer.
Drinkability is pretty solid. The abv shows up, and is complimented well by alcohol and oak flavors, but still doesn't seem as high as 11%. By the styles standards, quite drinkable.
Overall a very impressive and unique beer from HOTD. A very tasty barrel aged concoction. Love the barrel profiles and the mouthfeel is just incredible. I really would love to have a few more of these, but one cellared bottle will have to suffice for now. I think this one definitely has great aging potential. If you have the opportunity to get your hands on some of this beer, get a few. Excellent beer. 1,682 charactersAKBelgianBeast, Aug 07, 2009

3.97/5  rDev -10.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5Thanks to a great trader!
Pours a thick, oily looking deep brown with some ruby amber tones to it when held close to a bright light source. I read that some other folks had heads on their beer. Mine had none. An increasingly aggressive pour produced some bubbling, but this is clearly a beer modeled after the Lost Abbey production line.
Smells like smoke, molasses, and ... apples! Wow, a boatload of apples in the smell. 
Taste is more complex. The smoky, not-quite-roasted-malt characteristic carries over from the smell. The fruit component is really, really surprising. Not just apples, but some berries, some candied fruits ... and there's a ton of alcohol heat. Too much. It's distracting. Glad I have a few bottles to sit on for a few years. A bit of brown sugar/molasses to the flavor, and maybe the barest hint of a woodsy/tannin flavoring.
It's a complex beer, but I'd be lying if I said the dominant characteristic right now isn't an alcohol heat. The mouthfeel is nice and thick, but it ... needs ... carbonation. Drinkability suffers as a result. 1,064 charactersOverlord, Jun 14, 2009
4.87/5  rDev +10.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.512oz bottle courtesy of some very generous Pac NW traders. Poured into a snifter.
Pours dark mahogany out of the bottle and settles in almost completely black in the glass with hints of amber showing through the edges. An aggressive pour produces a small bubbly head that forms a solid ring and leaves good lacing.
The aroma takes some time to open up as it warms. It's generally sweet with the red apple peels being the dominant aroma initially but with some bourbon and vanilla as it warms. There is sweet caramel as well as hints of smoked malts and chocolate.
The taste is stunning. It's got so much going on and yet everything comes together in a perfectly balanced package. There is the initial sweetness of the apple brandy which gives way to the caramel malts of the backbone. The finish has a touch of sweetness but with a wonderful boozy, smoky finish that just clings to the palate.
The mouthfeel is near perfect. It's full bodied with minimal soft carbonation and just coats the palate completely. Absolutely decadent feel.
Well, when you take one of my favorite beers (Adam) and start playing around with it, you start to wonder if they should just not mess with a good thing. Well, in this case, the end product is a near-perfect beer that has a complexity that is unrivaled by almost anything else out there. World class. 1,341 charactersgford217, Jun 14, 2009
4.32/5  rDev -2.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4**I was able to taste a more recent batch of Matt (2010 release), which I enjoyed quite a bit more then the first batch (Bottleworks X release). Firstly, there was perfect carbonation (compared to the X release, which was flat). The booze was there, but not quite as up-front as the previous version. Just a couple of small observations and overall, a better beer.
Poured from 12oz bottle into Duvel tulip.
A - Brown in color with very little head present. There is some lacing though, once you tilt the glass from side to side. The brown is clear though, as you can see a small amount through the glass. Small bubbles are visible along the edge of the glass, but really nothing much to note.
S - Lots of sweetness going on here. Some fruits, sugars, malts all hitting your nose all at once. A big whiff puts the smell in your nostrils for a good amount of time even while the glass is away from your nose. There is some alcohol burn but really not a lot considering the ABV on this beer. 
T - Apples, bourbon, oak, sweet sugars and vanilla. Very little alcohol detected here, which is impressive. A full-creamy finish, very rich. Lack of carbonation takes away from the taste.
M - Medium bodied. Very rich. Pretty much flat, which is disappointing for me.
D - A sipper for sure, but I do like this one. I don't know if I'll try to score another through trades, because I'm disappointed that it's basically flat. 1,418 charactersSean9689, Jun 05, 2009
4.72/5  rDev +6.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Big, big thanks to the kind BA who sent this one my way. I had been dying to get a hold of it and finally chose last night for the night to use it as a night cap. Served chilled down to cellar temp and poured into a pint glass, this gem was consumed on 05/31/2009.
The pour was near spot on for the style. Rich looking dark caramel brown with a light, modest looking layer of lace and foam on the top. Smooth, elegant streaks running down the side of the glass throughout the session really made it have a smooth, very nice look to it. Rich, perfect aroma of toffee and butterscotch. Smooth caramel notes and a light earthy grain. Just the right touch of a boozy note added on top of an otherwise flawless execution of the style. Wonderful notes of toffee and chewy candy like flavors just ripple across the tongue. Wonderful blend here of sweet malty flavors with an almost chewy flavor to it. Quite intense I have to say. Mellow, light carbonation but no where near flat, this is exactly how I want an old ale to be, and it showed. I could have sipped on this one all day as once it reached up to room temperature it was perfect.
Overall a big, big winner here. This was quite simply one of the best of the style I have ever had. Not even a touch hot either, this one will surely live up to the hype for anyone who can track it down. 1,343 charactersmikesgroove, Jun 02, 2009

The liquid is viscous enough to cling nicely to the sides of my glass though. The noise features quite a bit of smoke. In the background I can pick out some oak, tobacco, and a bit of the apple brandy. The flavor is pretty complex, and I can easily say that I've never tasted anything quite like it. You get plenty of smoke, smooth oaky vanilla, and wonderful apple brandy. The mouthfeel is full and viscus, but for the most part flat. Matt is great, but I really with he was carbonated. 559 characterstjthresh, Jun 01, 2009
4.18/5  rDev -5.4%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Served lightly chilled around 55ºF / 13ºC
A vigorous pour into my 25cl tulip glass just produces a fat-one-finger thick, nicely browned, dark tan colored head. The beer is quite dark, almost black really with perhaps a touch of brown to it. When held up to the light the beer shows brilliantly clear, deep, dark ruby highlights. The aroma is quite smoky, phenolic even; the smoke character doesn't have the richness that I associate with beech-wood (Rauchbier) or alder-wood (Alaskan Smoked Porter) smoked beers, instead it is a little thin, though really this might be because the smoke is not nearly at the same level as those other smoked beers. The smoke here combines with a distinct fruitiness that reminds me of raisins, prunes and even some brandy like notes along with a touch of warming alcohol. At times the alcohol can be quite noticeable in the aroma, especially after I have started to drink the beer. The fruit character becomes very rich and interesting if you concentrate on the nose for a bit. There is also a touch of roast malt character noticeable after a bit as well. Not a bad nose, but the up front smoke character is a little thin and sharp at times, though it does have a nice underlying richness.
The beer is creamy and viscous feeling with only a faint carbonation that supplies a very soft prickle. The beer is fairly sweet, which accentuates a dark, concentrated fruitiness, but both of these are offset somewhat by a sharp malt influence. Roast grain notes provide a burnt-bitterness to the finish, perhaps a touch of acrid notes as well as a touch of burnt acidity. The smoked malt is a bit fainter than it even was in the nose, but it does provide a subtle smokiness that provides some richness to the beer as well as a hint of sharp smoke phenolics that is just noticeable at times. The rich fruitiness is the most noticeable part of the flavor; notes of prunes, raisins and roasted berry notes are all quite noticeable. Subtler fruit notes of caramelized apples, a touch of dates as well as some not so subtle rich, Brandy-like fruitiness. Alcohol is evident, but donesn't get past supplying a nice warmth and a bit of spiciness. While rich feeling on the tongue, the beer isn't overly heavy and in fact is a bit more drinkable than might be safe.
For a beer that has a fairly middling aroma to it, the flavor has turned out to be quite nice. This is definitely a sipping brew and I am really enjoying the rich, concentrated fruitiness here that is just supported by roast malt notes and a hint of smokiness. After a slow start, this ends up being quite an enjoyable brew. 2,611 charactersGueuzedude, May 24, 2009
4.82/5  rDev +9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5On tap at the brewery.
Appearance: Dark brown in the glass, semi-hazy and nearly black, with two fingers of lasting tan head.
Smell: Incredible apple brandy aroma with smatterings of bourbon, smoke, tobacco, vanilla and toast. Complex and utterly intoxicating, this has to be one of the best smelling beers I've come across.
Taste & mouthfeel: Big juicy apple flavor with bourbony vanilla and caramel right beside it. Flavors of maple syrup, smoke, caramelized sugar and tobacco appear mid-palate. Fairly hot, but pleasantly so, with a rich, full body. Smoky-sweet finish. Remarkable complexity on display here, and I'm amazed at how harmonious it tastes given the unusual blend of apple eau de vie and bourbon barrels with such a smoky base beer. My new favorite Hair of the Dog beer. 788 characterslargadeer, May 19, 2009
4.44/5  rDev +0.5%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Thanks to LilMatrix for this 12oz bottle poured into a snifter.
Matt pours a dark mahogany that lets little light through, with a small tan head that fades quickly.
The smell is different each time I put my nose to the glass. At first I just smelled some malty sweetness but then you get a little bourbon and oak and lastly some very nice sweet apple, very inviting.
The taste of the beer is just as complex as the nose, starting with some smooth bourbon and booze and melting into a very interesting mix of light cinnamon and tart apple (strange because I still smell sweet apples??) The alcohol is present but welcome, a very nice warming sensation in the mouth and stomach after a few sips.
Not a lot of carbonation, just a smooth feel.
I would not drink more than one bottle in a sitting, definitely a sipper, but it is an excellent beer that I would love to revisit. I think this beer would get better and better with time and I would love to try it after a few years in a cellar. 990 charactersrpstevens, May 07, 2009
4.47/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Had the pleasure of drinking this one at Browers. Poured into a snifter. 
Dark brown, close to black, but it could be the lighting in the bar. Minimal tan head, dissipates and vanishes in less than one minute.
Nice malty aroma, as expected. Fruitiness, mainly apples, spices, chocolate, and an alcoholic note reminiscent of brandy come to mind. 
Velvety on the palate, low carbonation, sweet and boozy would be a fine way to describe it, but will try to make it more eloquent. 
Chocolate, port wine, apples, more alcohol bite although not unpleasant. Some spiciness, perhaps cardamom and cinnamon come and go. Some oak notes are present as well. 
A great beer, but just short of spectacular. Perhaps some age could do it, but unfortunately I will probably never find out. 772 charactersbrdc, May 04, 2009
4.22/5  rDev -4.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to younger35 for this bottle. Received from him in a trade at Dark Lord Day 2009.
G: Poured into an oversized snifter.
A: Cola brown coming out of the bottle, gathering into a near-black as it sits in the glass. Almost zero head. Faint swirls as the beer warms up and is swirled. This also creates mild lacing. 
S: Caramel with lots of dark fruits and hints of green apple. Perhaps the tiniest bit of anise. Some hints of oak, as well as plenty of warming esters from the alcohol. Some yeasty sourness. 
T: Smokiness is my initial impression. More of the tart green apple than was present in the nose. The same hints of oak are there as well. As it warms up, the apple brandy and oak tastes are coming out a bit more. 
M: Medium bodied with very little carbonation. Not too many hints of alcohol. 
D: A very nice sipper. Complexity increases as it warms up. An all-around very good brew. 900 charactersThorpe429, Apr 29, 2009
4.64/5  rDev +5%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Always a special occasion when opening any Hair Of The Dog beer, especially when it's one brewed for a special occasion--this time the 10th anniversary of Seattle beer store Bottleworks. This is from the B'works website: "When in doubt, always remember our Mission Statement: It's not about drinking to get drunk; it's about drinking fine, imported beers to get drunk!" I don't know if that's good beer advocacy or not, but it sounds good to me.
Pours a super-dark brown, bordering on black, with zero head. I imagine this is due to the aging and high alcohol content. Just a few bubbles cling to the glass here and there. Knowing this brewery, I'm going to assume this doesn't taste as unremarkable as it looks. 
Wood, mint and tobacco roar up from the liquid into the nose. Something fruity arrives, as does a smack of anise, lending another exotic layer to an already interesting and enticing aroma. Just a slight hint of alcohol warmth too, although very much secondary to the prime aromas.
One single sip and this is right up there fighting for the #1 spot with a couple other HOTD favorites. Where to begin on the flavor impressions...a grapey/vinous flavor wraps its considerable presence around chocolate, wood, smoke, sherry, various tart fruits and black currant. Clings to the mouth nicely, and finishes with an amalgam of all the detected flavors. Smooth, rich, full of flavor, vibrant yet utterly well-balanced. 
Because the flavor is enormous, it's probably good this isn't the thickest, chewiest beer on the planet. Its slickness and glide work well in delivering the flavors right up front and also keeping it incredibly drinkable. Slightly sticky but not at all syrupy--a rare beer of this size and flavor stature that doesn't seem at all filling or insanely rich.
Matt is an absolute mindblower, especially if you're into big American strong ales. ***Thanks to my main HOTD hookup msubulldog25 for looking out for me yet again. Cheers, Brian!*** 1,968 charactersMetalmonk, Apr 12, 2009
4.77/5  rDev +7.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Pours amber brown to black in color with zero head, a skirmish of bubbles around the edges. A decent yeast ring still in the bottles bottom.
Aroma is strongest of apples, both sweet and tart. Some tart apples and hay, as well as some sweet apple pie with spices. Brandy like booziness in the aroma as well. Strong deep chocolate and some yeastiness in the aroma as well. Taste is very strong of apple brandy, absolutely delicious. The apples mix with sweet chocolate up front, though the chocolate keeps more to the background. Some spices come in mid taste, cinnamon? The brandy takes the fore front in the finish with a nice spicy, peppery heat on the tongue and throat, with some wood, and oak notes. Mouthfeel is fairly full, the sweetness would be somewhat cloying if not for the apple and the heat. Low carbonation, spicy, peppery alcohol on the tongue and a drying finish. Extraordinary beer, unique flavors that come together very well. Not sure if this was done partly in brandy barrels, but the apple brandy flavor is strong and very nice. Can't wait to see what some age does to this as it mellows and the flavors have time to blend together. 1,153 charactershoppymeal, Apr 03, 2009
4.47/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A: Dark rudy brown. Pours pretty flat and looks relatively thick. Not a super attractive looking beer.
S: Gorgeous. Wonderfully nice tart apple liqueur. Nice oaky aromas, with tons of dark fruit. Not nearly as smoky as the regular Adam, which I like given the other characteristics. 
T/M: Dark fruit and apple flavors are prominent. This really tastes like a liqueur to me, with lots of mouth-coating acidity and sugar. Nice big caramel malt backbone. Full-bodied. This is an awesome beer.
D: Despite the abv and intensity of the flavors this is a very drinkable beer for me. I'm glad they put this in 12oz. bottle, though 625 charactersabfraser, Mar 28, 2009
4.59/5  rDev +3.8%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Split a bottle with abfraser on a Saturday morning before JoeySchlitz's wedding.
A: Uneventful appearance. Dark brown cola color without any head.
S: One of the best smelling beers I've had. Tart apples, sweet caramel and dark fruits. Really rich, complex smell that is hard to put into words.
T: Same characteristics as the smell - the tart apple is outstanding, and meshes perfectly with the sweet dark fruit qualities. Slightly smoky, but not overly so. Very sweet. I'm not picking up any hops. 
M: Fairly thick body and very low carbonation. Good job of not making this syrupy though. 
D: Not sure since I'm only having half a bottle, but this is terrific. A dessert beer and one of the better brews I've had. 718 characterswaltonc, Mar 28, 2009
4.64/5  rDev +5%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Appearance: Pours a clear dark brown color without much of a head; not much lacing, either
Smell: Caramel with dark fruit galore - figs, dates and prunes
Taste: All of the dark fruit from the aroma arrives up front, with a leafy bitterness developing by mid-palate; the bitterness increases after the swallow, but there is plenty of dark fruit flavor to match its intensity; tobacco flavors appear in the finish, as well
Mouthfeel: Full body with low carbonation
Drinkability: Really interesting flavor profile; very creative and certainly an exceptional beer; just wish there was a bit more carbonation 607 charactersbrentk56, Mar 25, 2009
3.9/5  rDev -11.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Pours very dark brown with a small light tan head and a thin ring of lacing.
Scent of fruits, oak, some sourness, and strong alcohol, but it almost compliments the scent.
Taste of oak, tobacco, earth and a hint of cinnamon with that same strong alcohol. It's a tasty brew and pretty complex, but it seems like something is missing.
Mouthfeel is heavy bodied and powerful, but nearly flat. 391 characterspaco1029384756, Mar 21, 2009

Appearance: Pours a deep, darkmahogany/burgundy with ruby-amber edges, not much head or lacing
Smell: Apple wood, brandy, sweet malt, vanilla, light gentleman jack whiskey, dark fruits (dates, raisins, and figs), caramel, toffee, oak, earth, leather, and a hint of smokiness
Taste: More sweetness, apple wood, brandy, malts, vanilla, light gentleman jack whiskey, dark fruits (dates, raisins, & figs), caramel, toffee, peat, oak, earth, leather, and a hint of smokiness
Mouthfeel: Very smooth, almost a bit oily. Thicker than I expected, almost like a RIS.
Drinkability: Very good, I drank it a little young, would love to try it with a few years to it. Very enjoyable, but it drinks very slowly. A beer to contemplate. 749 characterscraytonic, Mar 17, 2009
4.82/5  rDev +9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured bottle into snifter and the smell of darkness came to mind. Very dark black, some highlights when held to light. Frothy mini head.
Smell was boozy, bourbon, apple wood, licorice, burnt sugar. A delightful smell to say the least.
Mouth-fell was thick and creamy coating the entire mouth. Notes of oak, dark figs, a little hot alcohol, chocolate notes. I just smoked a chicken with apple wood and I am getting similar taste from this brew as the smoke on the meat. No joke.
Overall , WOW what a brew! It was easy for me to drink despite being young with a high ABV%. Had to pick up two more of these after having tried one. Its worth the price and the effort. With age it will be a masterpiece. Bravo. 709 characterscannabanaceae, Mar 07, 2009
4.74/5  rDev +7.2%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5On draught at Brower's for their 10th anny, this was by far my favorite beer of the night, and I just gave the New Beligum anny an A+ (reviews are from copious notes at the bar)! Served in a Leffe goblet, Matt is a dark ruby brown with a quickly dissipating, big bubbled tan head that leaves very light lace. 
Smell is strong and bright, with a big blast of apple brandy and sweet, rich malts. The warmer this got, the more depth it picked up, and the better it got. 
Taste is fantastic, and even more robust then the nose. Really nice smokiness, more sweet dark malts and apple brandy, with a slight touch of coconut. Surprisingly smooth, the time in the barrels really helped this round out nicely, and will make it hard for me to hold out on my paltry 2 bottles. Tons of complexity, this is my favorite HOTD of all time, and he has really put out some great beers. 
Mouthfeel is very smooth, with an oily slickness and surprisingly lighter body.
Drinkability is very high, as it's a fantastic beer. In spite of it being a rare, expensive one off, it goes down very easy, and if I lived by Brower's I'd be drinking it until it was gone. Wow. 1,147 charactersccrida, Mar 04, 2009
4.79/5  rDev +8.4%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Alright I get to pop the review cherry. I'm super excited to have this beer. Made the drive up to Bottleworks this morning, and fought the masses to get this. Plus my name is Matt so it is just extra cool for me. 
A- When I was pouring this beer it looks like a dark walnut brown. But in the glass it is a very dark, almost black beer. The head is just some sexy lacing on the edge of the beer floating there seductively. 
S- This smells AMAZING! The whiskey and the apple are very strong smelling, but yet they don't over power the other smells. There is a great oak wood smell that is dry and semi old smelling, yet rich and smooth. I'm getting some great dark fruits as well, mostly dates. The smokeyness is slight, and adds a great flavor. The alcohol smell is very faint, but is there none the less.
T- Complex! There is a lot going on in this beer, and it all seems to come in layers with the flavors being individual, yet they can blend together very well. Spiced apple cider, mixed with a whiskey taste almost reminds me of a spiked apple cider for a cold night. The malty goodness is there giving this beer a rich and luscious caramel chocolate malt ball taste. Dates and raisins are a taste that is present in the after taste and add another layer to this great brew. The smoke taste comes though as a nice subtle flavor that helps lift up the rest of the tastes, its not overpowering like some smoke flavors in other beers can be. Each time I taste this it just gets better and better. 
M- The feeling of this beer is great. It isn't thick, yet the slight carbination that is there is just the right amount. This is very smooth and I love it.
D- Super easy to drink. I sort of have to hold myself back from just drinking this, but more of sip and slowly enjoy. I just want more and more. 
This beer is amazing. Totally worth the drive up to Seattle. I wonder how much more amazing this will get with a few more months or even a year or two on it. But it is just amazing now. 1,991 charactersWetpaperbag, Feb 26, 2009
