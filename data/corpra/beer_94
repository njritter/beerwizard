4.5/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I poured this into a snifter, here we go. The appearance, well, it poured like motor oil and I even heard the "glub glub" sound as it strolls out of the bottle, (did I pour too fast, hmmm...most likely not?). The head is about a finger’s worth of off-white to a nice tan color that lasts for a good minute before dieing and leaving a super nice coating of tan lacing clinging very nicely to the glass. The smell is an almost perfect aroma to any imperial stout anyone could ever want. It goes a little something like this: super nice oaky/woody vanilla, cherry, chocolate, molassess and licorice. There is a slight aftertaste and its kinda woody with a nice dose of lingering molasses and vanilla. The finish is quick, dry and sweet. On the palate, it sat about a medium to heavy. I sure did sip this. This is one not to gulp. Sessionability - ha, no way, man, one and done. ABV is felt. The carbonation is smooth and good for the style and for me. Overall, American Double/Imperial Stout, wow, this practically defines it. Don’t ever pass up on this if you ever see it. 1,074 charactersLone_Freighter, Jun 12, 2017

22 fl. oz. brown glass bottle, "BOTTLED ON: 12/08/16" and sampled on 05/23/17
$21.99 @ Weis Market #231, Conshohocken, PA
Notes via stream of consciousness: It's been quite a while since I first tasted The Abyss on tap at Toronado in San Diego back in September of 2008. I recall that I've had one bottle since, and unfortunately that review seems to have been lost, but the price has definitely kept me away. Well, that and the fact that I haven't seen it on tap, although I'm sure that would be really expensive as well. And looking at it in that way, maybe buying a full bottle just for myself is a better idea: it's just a dollar an ounce versus probably more at a bar, or not (?), but I can enjoy it peacefully and without interruption, comfortably in my own home for as long as I like ~ or as long as it lasts! I should also note that for my area the price that I got was good, I've seen it for $4 to $6 more at the specialty bottle shops. I'm looking at the label now and it lists quite a bit of ingredients and barrel aging, which I'm not sure existed in 2008. I don't know, I'm not sure, but I thought it was a little more straightforward back then. Anyway, it's completely opaque black in the glass beneath a short head of densely creamy brown froth. It appears to have excellent head retention but I'll check back in on that. The aroma expresses cocoa powder, caramel, coffee, and a soft ashen roastiness. The flavor is much fuller, adding in notes of red berries, red wine, earth & leaves, licorice, burnt sugar, and baker's chocolate. I can see from the few sips I've taken that it leaves some impressive lacing, and the head is still there, but thinner. Ah, there are some hops in the burp! They don't quite come through clearly in the mouth as they've got to fight through the dark malt. With another sip, as it warms and the head dwindles, I find Bourbon and oak, and a bit of moist chocolate cake in the aroma. Is that the vanilla coming through? As it opens up the flavor widens even further as well, showing notes of cherry, black currant, and molasses, and a heavier roastiness with a bit of dark malt acidity. There's a little bit of alcohol in play, although it's pretty clear in the finish, and along with a solid bitterness and oaky dryness it's really bone dry at the end. I can't tell if I like that or not, I mean it's not really sweet up front to begin with. Hmmm... the berry notes do linger nicely though. I wonder how much the wine barrels add to that. I still have a solid surface covering on it, which is pretty amazing. The label lists it at 11.1% ABV but I guess there's enough malt that it's holding up. It's not that carbonated. I guess it was a little higher at first, it's warmed a bit by now, but it's smooth with just a gently tingle across the palate. Medium-full in body I'd say, oily, and it airs up a bit to become fluffy as it warms on the tongue. So is it worth it? Well this last time around I decided to splurge and I also bought a bottle of Boulevard Rye on Rye Sazerac for $15 and a bottle of Brooklyn Cloaking Device for $23.99, so it's in-between the cost of those, and it's pretty good. It's better than a lot of other Imperial stouts, including some of my favorites, so I guess the answer is yes. Ahh haa, as an aside I've just remembered a good little laugh about my first encounter with The Abyss. While I was in Toronado a group of guys in suits came in to visit, and one of the older guys came over to me and asked what I was drinking, and what I'd had on tap that I'd recommend. I was drinking a Ballast Point beer at the moment which I told him was OK, but that I'd recommend the Abyss. That was, of course, not the response he was hoping for as he was the head guy from PALM at the moment, visiting the U.S. because they'd just released it on draft. He told me I had to try the Rodenbach and bought one for me, although I told him that I'd already had it, that I was a big fan, and even more fond of the Alexander which they didn't make anymore to which he responded "Oh, yes, the Alexander, everyone keeps asking for us to bring that back." At that point I told him that I would like to try the PALM but I guess it's one free beer per customer, and he shook my hand and gave me his card and told me to try it and he and his buddies walked out (they'd probably already settles up). Still, my most memorable moment of the day (apart from seeing Nick Cave around the corner as he was playing later that night) was the Abyss. 4,515 charactersNeroFiddled, May 23, 2017

Murky black in color with pretty thick dark tan head as an inviting showcase, the head retains itself with good retention before gradually collapsing to a long-lasting bubble sheet on the surface and leaving lots lacing patch and spot on the glass-side.
The aroma is infused with mellow yet aggressive barrel-aged Imperial Stout character. It harmoniously discloses the notes of coffee, chocolate, roasted, dark bread, dough, and charred nut as a typical Stout aroma. There comes closely thereafter the depth of the other characters like molasses, licorice, vanilla, cherry, oaky, winy, woody, spicy alcohol, grape, and fruity zest.
It is nearly flawless through the palate sensation. Kicking off with fruity, grape-ish and winy notes, then comes the rich malty goodness of coffee, chocolate, roasted, dark bread, dough, and charred nut just exactly like the aroma. The addition of molasses, licorice, cherry, and vanilla making it more complex and tasty together with notes of barrel aging of spicy alcohol, woody, oaky, and winy taste, the end and aftertaste is lasting with roasted and BA character.
Full body with some bold touch and creamy smooth mouthfeel through the palate, the feeling is just right with suitable amount of crispness and moderate carbonation to carry all the things well. Finish is pleasantly dry.
“The Abyss”, it is big and bold yet hefty and intense. Anyway, it is also delicate yet very tasty through its sheer complexity but pretty easy to enjoy with and excellent for sipping. Everything is very well harmonized and categorized. It is truly a masterpiece. 1,672 charactersEverydayoff, May 14, 2017

It features a very robust ABV of 12.20% and a nicely balanced 65 IBU.
It's got a long head on the pour, a bit bitter on the first sip, but after letting it sit a few minutes it mellowed a bit with a rich mouthful of licorice, scotch, with a hint of dark chocolate followed by a long finish. 397 charactersScooter131313, May 02, 2017

4.85/5  rDev +8.3%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Purchased a 22oz bottle from Tavour. I waited a long time to crack this baby open. Finally found a friend willing to share. Totally worth the wait!
 Poured onto the glass I loved what I saw. Pours a viscous dark brown that looks jet black in the glass. A fantastic creamy foam mocha head rises up invitingly, it's enticing and a predictor of the richness in aroma and flavor that is to follow.
In the nose there is chocolate fudge sweetness. It is redolent of a rich and decadent dessert. Playing a supporting role is an aroma of roasted malt, coffee, oak and dark fruit, of which cherries will figure prominently in moments to come.
In the mouth there is just so much going on, it is that complex; even more so than the aroma. I'll start straight away with the mouthfeel, body and drinkability. It is fluffy, velvety, creamy and smooth. It fills the mouth like soft clouds, floating and weightless. Yet, the dichotomy of this is that the body is full, robust and sipper despite the fact that it's drinkability is dangerously high. Does this thing even have alcohol? I didn't notice it until 3/4 of the way through. Whoa!!
But this doesn't even begin to scratch the surface of how dynamic and complex this brew is. At the beginning, the elixir coats the mouth with rich chocolate fudge, dark caramel and creamy sweetness; a true dessert treat. Yet, there is so much more to it. The roasted malts and espresso tones add support. However, where this stout truly becomes special is with the woody, oak like, earthy, tree bark tones which add a nice bitterness. In addition, there is a moderate but bold serving of grassy hops that compliments things and adds a lingering aftertaste. The cherry on top-so to speak- is that the bark comes from a cherry tree; very apropos because there is a slight cherry tartness that that adds a light counterpoint to the full bodied chocolate darkness. Notes of licorice are present, as well as a bourbon, which incidentally sneaks up on you.
 Wow! I feel that as I gain more experience in reviewing beer, I tend to be more critical and shed the superlatives of my earlier reviews. Yet, this might quite possibly be the best imperial stout I have ever had! 2,187 charactersGajo74, May 01, 2017

A:  Head is moderate brown with an absolute motor oil body underneath.  Curtain like lacing left on the inside of the tulip glass with repeated sips.  Look cannot be improved upon.
S:  Somewhat distant which is true to the style but I cannot rate it with the highest rating since it was not very distinctive.
T:  Simply great.  Dark roast malt, chocolate notes.  This may be THE example of a RIS.  Wow!
F:  This is an absolute asset of this beer.  Smooth, silky smooth.  Oh yeah.  Late in the taste is a grainy aspect but this is top feel.

Pours a deep dark black with brown head -2fb. Smells of cocoa, coffee, leather, smoke/leather. Taste is cocoa, hint of vanilla, smoke/char with a lot of burnt notes, acidity, sweet malts and a somewhat flat finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, minimal effervescence, well hidden abv. A somewhat powdery quality.
Overall, interesting – my palate isn’t refined enough to note all the differing elements. Not bad – but I wouldn’t go out of my way to find this. There are better (and cheaper) barrel aged stouts 527 charactersThaneMcC, Apr 22, 2017

After a decade of cellaring I was worried about oxidation but glad it was covered in a thick wax coating.  All I can say is this beer has not only held up, but can more than hold its own against the much hyped FO's and Assassins that it paved the way for.  A lot of breweries claim their big Imp Stouts will age well but then fail to live up to expectations due to infections and oxidation issues.  Anyone claiming the beer can be cellared should use wax (not foils...looking at you Firestone Walker Anniversary).  
The currant/ molasses sweetness melds perfectly with the  vanilla oak backbone.  This is an old favorite that can still teach a thing or two to the new kids on the block.  Excellent job Deschutes.  Glad I still have one more 2007 that I look forward to drinking 5 years down the road. 866 charactersthe_beerist, Apr 08, 2017

The flavor is incredible, dark dark chocolate, red wine, a slightly burnt flavor.  Sweetness along with a hoppy bitterness. The beer feels thick and silky but not overly thick. Get this if you can find it. It is worth the high price and more.
I regret buying just one bottle. 380 charactersandrewh995, Mar 27, 2017

The stout looks amazing. Inky black base with tons of lacing on the glass. The head lasts forever. It has some large bubbles clinging to the side and a film of tiny bubbles covering the surface.
The smell is dominated by the dry, vinous quality of the red-wine barrels. It is oaky and a little bit tart-smelling. There is some dark fudge, vanilla, and oak in the background, mingling with chocolatey roasted malt. It also has a hint of that European dark-chocolate malt scent that you get from a stout from Mikkeller or To Ol.
The flavor follows through with similar flavors under a layer of dry bitterness. There is a ton of oak and some spice similar to rye. It reminds me a lot of dark chocolate and red wine.
The feel is quite good. It could be a bit more viscous, but it has a nice tongue-coating density without a tooth-rotting sugar feeling.
I find the Abyss to be a bit over-hopped. It's a bit too floral and bitter for a barrel-aged stout, at least to my taste. On draft, it comes out more chocolatey, but from the bombers, I always find it to be awfully bitter. I wish they would tone down the hops a bit and let it spend a little more time in bourbon barrels. It doesn't have the boozy bourbon sweetness of something like BCBS nor the dense, dark-chocolate and red-wine character of something like cabernet-barrel-aged Laika imperial stout from Straight to Ale. 1,410 charactersccg, Mar 26, 2017

4.68/5  rDev +4.5%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Awesome beer. Pours black and slow with a tan, almost brown head. Sits in the glass heavily, it's own inertia exaggerated by the sheer magnitude of the  beer.  
Smells like dried wood and sweet molasses, with some raisin and a bit of alcohol coming through. 
The taste is sweet and dark, with oak and smoky sugar coming through prominently. Hints of vanilla and licorice, with just a hint of raisin and that warm boozy finish. 
Body is sticky and smooth. Full without being even slightly cloying. I think the loads of alcohol keep the body acceptably quaffable for such a huge stout.

Nose began with bourbon and dark fruit, them meandered towards coffee and sort of stays there.
Taste begins with coffee, then invites bourbon and molasses in. The coffee element lends a touch of smokiness that mingles with dark chocolate, which contributes something of a sweet yet ashy finish.
Silky smooth body, very smooth. Maybe just a little more thin than I had expected, but no real issues with it. Alcohol is masterfully hidden, it's a touch dry, and the aftertaste is a well balanced bitter and sweet. 632 charactersgopens44, Mar 05, 2017

5/5  rDev +11.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This is one of my favorite beers!!  It is a truly unique imperial stout.  I give it a 5 out of 5.  I learned with the 2014 version (where I was fortunate enough to get an entire case) to let it age as it has a bitter taste that disappears with age.  That said, I had the 2015 version draught at 600 degrees and it was quite awesome without the aging.  I picked up a couple of 2016 today, so I thought I would go ahead and drink one of the 2015 bottles.
After aging, the licorice comes to the foreground more, and the vanilla/cherry bark ease up to be more balanced.  I don't really directly pick up the wine barrel here with the depth of complex flavors, but do in Collage 2 where it has been blended with other beers.  I like the 2015 better than the 2014 and can't really explain why... something from the abyss of complex flavor! 833 characterstprinzing, Mar 04, 2017

Nose leans toward the coffee and licoric earns less toasty notes.  wood and vanilla as well.  Taste, however, is much larger.  Really well incorporated for the ABV and all the stuff thrown in.  Big stout flavors mix with the barrel and adjuncts without anything being weird, cloying, off balance, or overly boozy.  Long finish turns a bit more woody as it dries, which isn't quite as nice.  Overall, a big beer with a lot going on that would go well in front of a fire during winter, but not something you'd want regularly. 606 characterscaptaincoffee, Feb 26, 2017

Now that they probably produce something like 10 times the number of barrels as the original batch in 2006, it does feel/taste a bit generic to me. Doesn't have the overall complexity or full-bodied mouth feel you might get with something like a Black Tuesday or Speedway (and variances).  I don't really care too much for this beer and agree with The Bros on this for the lower rating. 456 charactersDannyBigs, Feb 22, 2017

4.39/5  rDev -2%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Poured a thick, jet black color with about a finger of tan head. Smells of cherries, malts, molasses, hints of bourbon, oak, and a little red wine. Tastes follow with the nose primarily, certainly takes a little warming up to draw them out. Comes out to a complex brew, sweeter cherry and molasses flavors, oak, and a little red wine flavor towards the end. Dry finish and tends to linger a little on the tongue. This is an interesting brew, one that I find isn't quite for idlying drinking but more for sitting and enjoying, perhaps with a friend or two, but with a little more focus on the beer. Tasty, good stuff that holds up well to some more recent stouts. 662 charactersRiff, Feb 19, 2017

Initial impression is dark chocolate, roasted malts, charred oak, molasses, dark fruits - and that was just the first sip!  Mouthfeel is thick and smooth; carbonation is on the light side.  The 11.1% ABV is quite well hidden.  Finish is smooth and just slightly bitter.  Things get even better as it warms.
I had no idea what to expect from this beer.  I tried the Abyss Brandy Barrel Aged a couple of days ago and found it quite good, but Reserve is outstanding - a notch above.  Very enjoyable.  Good winter evening sipper, especially with a roaring fire in the fireplace.
I was only able to get a single bottle of Abyss - I wish I had a couple more to cellar. 780 charactersdbl_delta, Feb 04, 2017

4.5/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.752016, Pours black. It smells complex - blackstrap molasses, licorice, coffee, dried fruit. The flavor is just about perfect, the various components combining so that nothing stands out but it all works together. Not too heavy either. Very smooth and creamy. 
When I tasted the 2015 a year ago, I thought "This is Stout perfection". I expected to be disappointed this time around but I was not. It is still Stout perfection. 423 charactersStrawman286, Jan 27, 2017

4.13/5  rDev -7.8%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.75Poured a month past the Best After date.  Thick, dark brown pour with decent head that lasts a bit.
Cold, the nose is sweet, malty, chocolatey, a hint of licorice.  As it warms, the various oaky characters come out more, though distinguishing between the regular oak, wine oak, and bourbon oak is beyond me.  Bourbon stands out the most, and I'm really not getting any wine.
Taste is much the same.  A bit sweet with the malts and molasses.   Oaky flavor and tannic body shine though, again, as it warms to room temperature.  Slightly bitter finish resembles roasted malts and ashy oak.
In a world full of big, barrel-aged imperial stouts, I'm not sure this adds anything new.  I'm excited to try the different variants that came out to compare them, but I won't bother seeking this out again if there are other similar options available.  There's so many different elements and ingredients in here, but most of them don't allow themselves to be detected in any meaningful way.  Molasses?  Barely.  Vanilla?  Not really.  Cherry bark?  With 3 different kinds of oak in here, it's hard to believe there was even a point.  Overall, well made, but over-engineered. 1,164 charactersjmasher85, Jan 24, 2017

Look: Sure, it's dark, but it's not literally abyssal.  It looks like every other high-end imperial stout.
Smell: Those oak barrels.  And the pinot.  No bourbon.
Taste: Everything in the nose repeats itself on the palate.
Feel: Nothing noteworthy.  Wish it were thicker.
Overall: If you like oak, you may like this beer.  Tastes like an experiment gone awry ($16.99 should be better than this).  22 ounces of disappointment poured into a tulip glass. 464 charactersMcBraniel, Jan 22, 2017
4.59/5  rDev +2.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5A very special brew for my 1500th review...  On my 40th Birthday...
L - Slightly more than two fingers worth of tightly packed dark brown froth with a few medium sized bubbles mixed in...  A slow but actively receding lop sided head that leaves bits of whipped lacing clinging to the sides of the glass...  Over very solid and respectable retention...  Once receded, there is a lopsided veil of lacing and thin to moderate collar...  The Abyss is a very proper names in terms of color as this one is black ink through and through, perhaps with some aubergine notes when back lit...   Sheets of lacing cling to the glass after each and every sip...  World class appearance...  
S - A big robust nose with lots to take in upon first whiff...  The first thing to really cut through is the black strap molasses which is sweet and inviting...  Next come a mix of sweet milk chocolate and brownie batter...  Hints of soy sauce and licorice are next...  These all sit atop vinous wine and oaky notes...  Dark fruits...  Jelly beans...  Some faint roasted malts as well...  A complex nose with oodles of depth and character...  Exceptional...  
T - The palate is ever bit as interesting as the aroma would suggest...  All of the expected stout characters are present...  Dark chocolate...  Molasses...  Soy sauce...  Licorice...  Brownie batter...  Picking notes of the virgin oak...  The tannin notes from the wine barrels really sines through on the finish and adds a ton of depth and richness...  Never detected much of the bourbon barrels, but that's okay...  This one a marvelous as is...  
F - On the fuller side of medium bodied...  Smooth...  Slightly seek...  Starts lush...  Slightly chewy...  Finishes with a surprising dryness...  A bit of a roll coaster ride that takes several sips to get accustomed to..  Overall each sip is an experience...  The words I'm left with after several sips is delicate and charming...  Again, world class...
O - Oh boy, this one was worth the close the decade wait...  I finally acquire this one (2014 reserve) and have let it sit for a few years...  Truly exceptional and world class in all facets...  This one is worth all of the hype and then some...  I'm forever fascinated by Deschutes "big beers," all of which live up to and exceed expectations...  
With that I bid beer reviewing farewell...  I may add scores from time to time, but my life as a detailed reviewer is coming to a close...  Cheers to everyone and I'm glad I went out in style with this one...  Remember - Great minds drink alike... 2,546 charactersphilbe311, Jan 22, 2017

S= All my fav things. Bit of coffee, chocolate, licorice, maple, molasses. I just love smelling this beer. Quite the aroma and gets better if it starts to room temp.  
T= Paird this with a pork chop marinated with a pear balsamic and side of sautéed asparagus. I highly suggest! Definitely brought out all the flavor of this beer. Easy to drink with a meal and not filling as you would think. The beer gets better as you let it warm up. Not sure if I'd drink it without being in the fridge but definitely gets more full as it sets out. 
F= Not thick and full as you'd might expect. Very drinkable. I'd prefer it just a little more syrupy if I were to use it as a dessert beer which it very well could be if it felt more filling. 
Overall= Can't get enough of it honestly. I stumbled upon it in my own. 2015 bottle. My local place had about 6 of them left over...so I bought them all without hesitation. A little pricey considering Goose Island Bourbon County Stout is stronger and a few fillers cheaper but this fills the void of not being able to get that beer as often as I could when I lived in Chicago. Definitely on my look out list for next year! Well done Deschutes! 1,339 charactersJust-the-sip, Jan 17, 2017

4.51/5  rDev +0.7%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.52015 Vintage, best after 12/8/16 - Pours black as a starless night - pitch black.  World class head volume, retention and lacing.  For a barrel aged beer, the head characteristics are uber world class.
World class complex nose of chocolate, light char, molasses, dark fruit (plum, raisin, currant), anise and hints of vanilla.  Bourbon is present but not overwhelming nor subtle - just the right balance to influence.
Heavy medium body that is smooth but falls just short of creamy, which is not surprising for 12.2% ABV.  Carbonation is light yet yields a nice somewhat prickly finish.  Carbonation / body balance is outstanding, considering barrel aging.
The flavor profile is world class but many flavors are not as pronounced as in the nose.  It begins with a notes of roast and char which flow into a nice oak accent coupled with anise.  The middle is where this beer hits its stride.  A rich semi-sweet burst of dark chocolate yields to molasses producing a sweet base.  Over the base, dark fruit emerges (mostly plum and currant) that slowly allows light vanilla notes to surface.  Once the vanilla arrives, a bit of astringent alcohol becomes uncovered along with a bit of heat.  Surprisingly, sweet chocolate takes center stage as the alcoholic burn intensifies and flows through the finish.  I strongly suggest that you step into The Abyss - often! 1,361 characterstillmac62, Jan 12, 2017

Pitch black with a dark tan head that quickly fades to wispy ring. Smells of strong bourbon, vanilla, coffee, chocolate, and cherries. Wow, thats smooth. Bourbon, vanilla, chocolate, long coffee and vanilla finish. Wine barrel flavors come into play in the aftertaste as well. Where did the abv go? Silky mouthfeel with little to no carbonation.

Ink - black, thIck, viscous pour with light head and lacing.  Upon pouring, aroma of the blackstrap molasses comes right across the table.  Taste is rich and complex.  The bitterness unique to the blackstrap comes out right in front of the roasted malts and then the brewer's licorice finish.  How they apportion such strongly flavored ingredients, I have no clue...but Deschutes seems to have mastered the art.  Sip it slowly and enjoy the experience. 562 charactersNickSMpls, Jan 08, 2017

22oz bottle poured into a snifter
A- pours pitch black in color with a dark brown creamy head that has good retention before settling into a ring
S- aroma opens with dark chocolate and espresso, followed by toasted dark bread, sweet molasses, licorice & caramel.  Barrel notes bring some earthy wood with an emphasis on the red wine barrel, that adds elements of dark berries and vinous red wine. Char and raisin close it out
T- opens up with charred roasted malt, along with chocolate and a bit of espresso, followed by notes of dark cherry, licorice & molasses.  Woody oak, followed by some vinous dark grape notes.  Finishes with dark fruit and charred malt 
M- medium body with low carbonation leads to a creamy mouthfeel that turns into a silky smooth finish, abv hidden well
O- most of the elements are identifiable throughout, but I can't help but think that this one may actually improve with age.  Will revisit in a year or so 953 charactersTreyliff, Jan 07, 2017

On the tongue, Big vanilla beans, bourbon barrels, dark chocolate, caramel, sweet like chocolate milk, absolutely delicious.
Feels thick but foamy, like hot chocolate with whipped cream.
This was the 2015 release, drank on January 6th, 2016.  I got it online, drinking it in Chiang Mai, Thailand.  Awesome brew.  Couldn't find in while in the US, so I was stoked to find it in Asia.  Amazingly thick, dense feel, with super taste and smell. 770 characterspatre_tim, Jan 06, 2017

Full bodied, nice combination of roastiness, char, and oaky sweetness, with medium low carbonation.  About as complex an American stout as I have had.

3.81/5  rDev -15%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.52015 bomber. Best AFTER date is 12-8-16. Guess I'm about a week early Deschutes.
A - poured into a snifter. Thin, jet black, coca-cola looking. Little head. Very thick however on the side of the glass with very dispersed lacing. It clings to the side of the snifter like wet paint and just doesn't all run back down. It looks very sticky.
S - burnt sugar and molasses. Dark fruit and cherries. Smoke of burnt wet wood. Sweet cream/vanilla.  Red wine. Minimal alcohol.
T - Wow. Incredible amount going on. I honestly can't even describe it after the first sip it's so complex. It tasted charred, but not burnt. Tons of light roast malt and chocolate flavor. Mild fruitiness. Faint vanilla and oak. The flavors are extremely strong and I'm finding my palate overcome between sips and it hard to recognize new flavors. If it has a flaw it's for being overly roasty and hard to discern the many other nuances underneath the charred flavor.
M - Great here. Not the fudgiest BA beer I've had but it's definitely not thin.  Very creamy and chewy. Definitely filling. Overall far above average mouthfeel.
O - Very impressed. $22/bomber impressed I'm not sure. I'd probably buy one a year at that cost but if it were in the $15 range I'd scoop it up without hesitation.
Edit - dropped taste and overall from 4.5 to 4.25 due to the beer becoming overwhelming with roast flavor and less enjoyable towards the finish. A 12oz would have been perfect but a bomber of this is difficult and nothing but burnt sugar and char after a while. I honestly considered drain pouring at 60% and drinking something else instead but the cost of the bottle has me sticking it out.
Edit. Tried one fresher on 2-12-17 (bottled December 2016). I don't get it. I really hate this. It's overwhelmingly burnt and charred. Dropped taste and overall to 3.5 from 4.25 each. 
I'll try this one more time, but that won't be until I cellar one for 3+ years to hopefully mute some of this bitter roast and maybe I'll understand the regard for this beer. 2,020 charactersrypkr, Nov 28, 2016

At that time it was still about 2 months away from the enjoy after date but I needed something I hasn't tried yet while up north in michigan on a cold fall evening around a fire and this was perfect. Flavors of vanilla, bourbon and maple and a hint of liquorice. Will get again next year. 359 charactersK-Dog, Nov 13, 2016

4.66/5  rDev +4%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75650ml bottle poured into Sam Adams pint glass. 2015 bottle.
Pours utterly black with a thin cap of creamy dark brown head that leaves clouds and blotches of dripping lace as it recedes.
Smells of dark chocolate, black cherries, moist tobacco, rich molasses, roasted marshmallow and wood smoke, bourbon whiskey, black licorice and gentle red wine tartness. Outstanding.
Tastes of rich dark chocolate drizzled over cherries and raisins, toasted brown sugar, aged bourbon, more smoky marshmallow and tobacco and more sexy red wine tartness. 
Feels soft and smooth. Full bodied with creamy carbonation. Finishes dry with hardly a hint of alcohol.
Verdict: Vigorously recommended. Good to an almost staggering degree. 717 charactersHat_Fulla_Beer, Nov 12, 2016

22 oz bottle to tulip glass.  Tasting with DC, Dark Lord vs. Parabola vs. Abyss.  Bottle actually says best after 12/08/16, so this is a little early.  Strange since i've had the bottle for 10 months or so.
LOOK:  dark black, really like an abyss, medium light brown head; josseling the glass reinvigorated a nice frothy top.
AROMA:  malt, tobacco, coffee, chocolate, oak.  Also hay, grass, 
TASTE:  vanilla and chocolate, but so much more...wood,    tobacco and smoke in the aftertaste are really interesting, 
FEEL:   amazingly thin, but full bodied...not sure if that makes sense, but this beer feels unique.

From what I can remember there was not much change in my opinion on this beer over that time. Absolutely black ink in color with almost no carbonation. Thick, oily,  smelled awesome with molasses and cherry hitting my nose predominately. Very warming mouthfeel soon extended to the brain. Love this beer, a sipping beer - where is my cigar?  This is a world classic, very complex notes as it warms. Highly recommend. 508 charactersRockAZ, Oct 26, 2016

Smells of charred grains, brown sugar, molasses, black licorice, vanilla, bourbon, oak, dark fruit and toffee and/or burnt coffee grinds. Simple, malty and wonderful to inhale - really a treat to breathe in.
Tastes like it smells with charred grains, brown sugar, molasses, black licorice, vanilla, bourbon, oak, dark fruit especially cherry and rotting pear, smoked wood, light piney hops and toffee and/or burnt coffee grinds. Wow, this is so complex, an amazing display of dragging different flavors out of smoked malts and bourbon barrels. This lived up the hype and was a lot smoother than it should be at 11.1% ABV (listed on bottle).
Mouthfeel is very creamy and smooth with mild carbonation, a medium body with mild bitterness and a nice finish that's smoky, malty and quite flavorful with nice vanilla and bourbon barrel notes. An outstanding beer, nothing more to say except I can't wait to drink more of it. Huge thanks to "Boccu" for sharing this bomber.
7/1/2017: Had it on tap at Brü Craft & Wurst in Philly and it was outstanding. It poured and looked better on tap, with color as black as an Abyss and a  brown head that lasted longer than expected. Exceptionally smooth, it was full of chocolate, roasted malts, cocoa powder, molasses, faint licorice, coffee grinds and a lot of smoky and chocolate sweetness and it faded with a cocoa powder finish and no traces of the booze.  Raised the "Look" score from 4 to 4.25 and the "Taste" score from 4.75 to 5, which bumped up the "Rating" score from 4.72 to 4.84. Seek this out! 1,722 charactersCHickman, Sep 18, 2016

A- Jet black, with almost no head
S- Initially I got some of the wine barrel (tannins, dry red), but as that died away I got brown sugar, molassis, dark fruits, maybe a bit of cherry.
T- Sweet dark fruits, but ends with a sharp smokey/ roasty bit.  
F- Medium thick... could be a bit thicker
O- Nice stout with both sweet and roastie bits.  Reminds me a bit of dark lord with all the sweet fruit, but has a bit more balance with the bite.  Bit is a bit too sharp for me. 484 charactersPBRmeasap1980, Sep 13, 2016

It's as boozy as expected at 12.2% but it's fairly smooth, save for a bit of a burn on the mid tongue. This was an awesome birthday present for myself. Too bad I have to drive 3 hours to find it. 428 charactersDesMoinesMike, Sep 05, 2016

4.12/5  rDev -8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4Cellared 2 yrs 8 mos. 
Poured into a tulip
Appearance: thick, silky when poured. Luxurious. Black-Onyx, void of light, even when held directly to light. 
Aroma: oak and bittersweet chocolate. Very little alcohol detectable. A bit of raisin (rum raisin?). No bourbon though.
Flavor: very enjoyable, but I fear that the 2 yrs 8 mos in the cellar have muted many of the flavors. No one flavor stands out. No dominant vanilla, licorice, bourbon etc. Instead all flavors are blended together. Quite enjoyable, just not what it might have been. 
Mouthfeel: thick and chewy. A meal by itself. Perfectly suited to carry its 11% abv. 
Overall: this is a quality beer, but it does live up to the hype or its price tag. Expectation of this beer exceeded what was delivered. Enjoyable nonetheless, but no more so than more readily available beers at much lower cost. There is a sizable disconnect between the beer's hype and the actual beer. Let me state again, I enjoyed this beer, but I was underwhelmed. 1,000 charactersPray_For_Mojo, Aug 22, 2016

Hardly any light getting through besides a hint of red towards the head. Khaki colored head with nice sticky lacing. Fades pretty quick to nothing. In the aroma, nice amount of creamy chocolate, vanilla, toffee. Bourbon and a nice heavy dose of dark cherries come though even more as it warms. Taste is amazing. First of all, the creamy milk chocolate is the most dominate note. But the undertones behind it are the highlight here: toffee, vanilla, cherries, and oak. Bourbon is very subtle, so is the wine barrels. But just enough to take notice. Mouthfeel is thick, palate coating for sure. Little carbonation. Overall definitely let this one warm, as it definitely changes to a different more attractive beer. Very solid, and very accessible. Highly recommended. 825 charactersMateo2699, Aug 21, 2016

A-Absolutely amazing looking. Poured black as night, with a beautiful 2 finger deep caramel red, with frothy head, that dissipates to a little ring.  spotty lacing. 
S-wow. Smells like chocolate cake, vanilla, molasses, bourbon, faint cherries and sweet malts. Very different aroma from other barrel aged beers. Flavors galore. 
T-Bourbon, chocolate, cherry, vanilla, molasses. The licorice is faint, but you can taste the presence of the wine barrels. Very smooth and pleasant, for 12%. Very drinkable. Very clean beer here. I could drink one of these every night before bed. 
M-Medium bodied with nice carbonation. The wine barrel really shines in this mouth. Nice, clean and semi dry finish. 
First time popping an Abyss. Definetly won't be my last. Very good beer! 830 charactersDrinkThemAll, Aug 21, 2016

I had the 2012 on draft at the Portland restaurant/taphouse. It was jet black with a beautiful frothy mocha head. Chocolate is prominant in the nose with undertones of vanilla and coffee. Chocolate is completely dominant in the taste and most other adjuncts had smoothed out at this point leaving an a well balanced roasted/slightly sweet stout with an even coating feel. No astringency or hot alcohol character. Glad I was also able to pick up a bottle of cognac aged as well! 608 charactersPhigg1102, Aug 12, 2016

Pours pitch black. Like, nothing - no highlights. Didn't even know beer could do that? Two fingers of tan head on top, with some light lacing as the beer drains. Nose is a touch milder than I'd expect. Roasted malt, some light coffee, dried fruit, lots of sweet chocolate and bourbon. Very nice. Flavor is incredible. Monster roasted malt, coffee, and chocolate. Some cookies, prunes. Big bourbon, and alcohol shows up as just a touch of heat at the back of the mouth - nicely hidden, especially given the ABV. A fantastic beer, huge flavors, one to get your hands on. Would be great to put down for a few years and see what happened to it. 755 characterssoupyman10, Aug 06, 2016

4.74/5  rDev +5.8%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5This was the first really good beer I had, so it is special to me in that sense. I go to Darkness Eve every October and it is usually on tap, and it's always great! This specific version is the bottled 2015 vintage.
A - Pitch black pour with the most gorgeous dark tan head I've ever seen. Head lingers for well in excess of 30 minutes! 
S - The aroma is subtle, but complex: dark chocolate and an interesting blend of barrel characteristics. Black licorice and some earthy hops also make an appearance.
T - Very unique blend of barrels here. The stout oak shines through above all, and the specific bourbon / wine barrels add a hint of sweetness as well - just right, but far from too sweet. Nice roasty, chocolate-marshmallow characteristics. Vanilla, and the slightest bit of anise, molasses and caramel. You could spend hours marvelling at the flavors of this beer! 
F - Feels like floating on smooth pillowy marshmallow clouds, with a bit of dark chocolate lightning and licorice thunder thrown in for good measure. 
O - Beers of this magnitude are quite rare. A lot of effort went into this beer, but it was entirely worth it! Mad respect to Deschutes. However I will say that if you don't like dry stouts, stay away from this beer. Go drink Bourbon County or something. 1,281 charactersgregy55902, Jul 31, 2016

S - big dark chocolate, roasted marshmallow, vanilla, light bourbon, toasted oak that's mellowed out. 
T - dark chocolate, red wine, toasted oak, burnt marshmallow, roasty malts, little bit of light bourbon in there, dark tart cherry
M - super heavy mouthfeel, alcohol present but so appropriate, aftertaste is dark roasty malts, red wine, oak
O - this is one of those beers I've had to have a few times to get accustomed to and realize how awesome it is, it also ages ridiculously well, I've had it brand new and now with the usual release being dec-Feb I'm guessing this is 6-8 months out which in my experience rounds big stouts out and can give them a little more depth. This one was more of a roasty dark malts bomb at first but now the barrel aging is really starting to come out. Great beer. I need to stock up at my usual bottle shop. 923 charactersHopHunter19, Jul 30, 2016

4.53/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5A: Gorgeous. Deep black body with a reasonable dark brown head. Big chocolate-brown bubbles stream up after the pour. Head stuck around for a while before receding almost completely, leaving a tiny wispy brown circle on the edge of the beer. Lacing is ample and sticky. 
S: Complex. Booze and barrel hits the nose first. Heavy liquorish, coffee, and chocolate all come out next. Molasses and dark malts are there as well. Smells roasted, thick, and sticky. Not as in-your-face as barrel aged Rasputin or BCBS, but still a strong and complex nose.
T:Liquorish and barrel dominate. Lots of the vanilla-wood-booze character you'd expect from a beer of this style. Barrel manages to be present without dominating. This beer does a superb job of balancing barrel flavors against stout flavors. Strong malt backbone props everything up. Lots of thick and sticky roasted malts remind me a bit of Ten Fidy. Finish is lasting bitterness. You can almost feel your throat pucker from the coffee and hop tones. Aftertaste is smooth cigar tobacco, malt, and bitter coffee. As it warms, molasses rises to the front of the profile. Wonderful.
M: Smooth and creamy, but still with some decent carbonation. Sticky, resinous, and rich. Fantastic. 
O: A superb beer. So complex, and yet so drinkable. A fantastic model for what a barrel aged stout should be. 1,343 characterslbloom, Jul 10, 2016
4.47/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.52014 vintage, pouredinto tulip glasses; quite vigorously:
Appearance: thick as hell and black as night, it encompasses the double stout style perfectly. Visibly viscous on the pour, with a color that is very dark. Some mildly lighter brown and ruby highlights on the edges. Slim mocha head that dissipates somewhat quickly. Leaves spotty brown lacing.
Aroma: seriously deep and decadent scents here. Licorice isn't prevalent, but I prefer it that way given that licorice to me is an off-putting flavor and aroma. The chocolate and sweeter bourbon character is the star here, with some thick and sweet molasses notes as well. 
Taste: this is a unique brew in a realm of beers that can blend into one flavor profile quickly. It begins with the traditional imperial stout characteristics, full of roast and dark chocolate, as well as plenty of bourbon and barrel flavor. The big difference that sets it apart from other big, dark stouts is the cherry and slight licorice flavor. It's not cloyingly sweet or overly fruity, but subtle enough to keep it tasty and balanced. Very nice.
Feel: the only SLIGHT issue I had with this beer is that it was maybe a touch thin? It's picky at this point, but when rating beers highly, I think it's gotta be done....
Overall: this is an excellent barrel-aged stout. Very unique in flavor and aroma, and packs tons of layers. 1,362 charactersTheElectricOne, Jul 10, 2016

4.56/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Vintage 2013.  I sat on this for a couple of years.
There's a big burst of foam on my pour into a small snifter.  Whatever the aging has done, it hasn't reduced the carbonation.
This beer is mellow, smooth, deep, rich, and incredibly complex, if that makes any sense.  I get licorice, I get the wine barrels, I get tobacco and molasses, and some raisins.  It's almost over the top in the number of different flavors in the mix, but then you realize it's really quite well balanced, and nothing dominates.  For a beer that has seen bourbon barrels, the bourbon is pretty much in the background.  I love BBA stouts, but this one is so much more than that.  It's really almost in a class by itself, or maybe it's somewhere in between an Impy Stout and a Quad.
I can't actually say what the aging did, because I'm sitting on my newer Abyss bottles.  It is the kind of beer that rewards patience. 894 charactersVashonGuy, Jun 08, 2016
4.8/5  rDev +7.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Vintage 2015, best after 12/08/16, per bottle. Why wait for that. Never tried this one. 
Stout glass pour: rich black with rust head that settles to leave delicate lacing. 
Rich body. 
Aroma is subtle and complex, with hints of rich chocolate, licorice, cherry, and some vanilla, all encapsuled in a barrel aroma where the wine barrel really stands out so as to disallow stronger bourbon notes from overpowering the aroma. 
Flavor is dark cocoa and molasses up front, and then evolves into licorice but without too much burn, smokey-sweet, pie-crusted malts, hops then barrel burn finish. Such a complex imperial stout. The "it" factor is about here for me as far as this style goes. The longer it warms and the farther in between sips, the more the licorice stays. 
Lives up to the reputation. 
For those who dislike licorice, or hops lurking in their big stouts, it may not be as big a hit. 
I normally don't like hops lurking in there to taste, but the execution here is terrific. 
Mouthfeel is medium-full, chewy. 
What would age do? Probably good things. 1,059 charactersTBoneJones, Jun 08, 2016

Chocolate, coffee, and tart fruit.

Complex. Chocolate, coffee, toffee, tobacco, etc... you name it and it is in this one.  There is a lot of flavors firing throughout this brew.  3 different barrels that this one is aged in so it really adds to the complexity.  Some fruit and a charred oak / smoked malt aftertaste.

Thick and syrupy.  Full bodied.

Look- pitch black with light tan head rimming glass.  
Smell- cherry, light bourbon, faint licorice.  
Taste-  initial bourbon, with cherry mid pallet and licorice late pallet. 
Feel- a little light for stout of this quality. 
Overall-  very solid beer that gets significantly better as it warms up.  Glad I got to try it.  While I liked it,  there are better beers for less money. 416 charactersjcflorian, May 30, 2016

I kept forgetting about this beer in the back of my fridge, and I'm glad that I did. Now, I have never had it fresh so I have nothing to compare it to, but this beer really impressed me. Very complex and unique. Pours a very dark brown with just a bit of tan head. Lots of oak on the nose, as well as chocolate and a bit of red wine. Taste starts like a typical stout. Chocolate and coffee followed by some cherry notes, then you get hit with the Pinot barrels, and a touch of vanilla towards the end. Feel is just average, if not slightly thin for a BA stout. Overall, I really enjoyed this beer from Deschutes. I think this would be more highly regarded it wasn't so widely available, and dismissed by some because they can't sit on it for the appropriate amount of time. 825 charactersSoCal_Matt, May 28, 2016

The aroma brings plenty of woodsy dark chocolate. Licorice shows up, as does a gentle hoppiness. My problem here is, while a solid nose, is overly muddled and underdeveloped. Flavor follows the nose. I do get a nice opening sensation of cherry wood to go with the dark chocolate notes. The back end is awash with piny hops, roast, and licorice. Seems muddled, complicated, and incoherent, hampering my enjoyment. On the other hand, I really enjoy the feel - the feel is dry finishing yet rich, warming, and palate coating. Gentle carbonation aids the easy drinking nature. Not particularly impressed with this - maybe it's too young? I respect Deschutes for telling you to age this a year, though; this should integrate more with age.

The wall of aroma is the real kicker here - I'd like it consolidated into a black candle to be lit at my funeral. All at once, cigars swirl around dense brioche, molasses, vanilla, oak, booze-soaked raisins, earth, chocolate, and dark caramel. The taste follows the nose, albeit in Willy Wonka-esque layers. The bourbon gives way to chocolate, then to yeasty bread, burnt sugar, coffee and vanilla bean; then comes spice, cherries, wine, and a crisp, hoppy finish that rounds off the decadence. I can't pick up on some of the advertised licorice notes, and I would prefer a bigger hit from the barrels, but the complexity on display is astounding all the same, and always begs another sip.
Mouthfeel is smooth and not too thick, striking what I suppose is a necessary balance between the variety of flavours on display. Carbonation props up the fruitiness, but may occasionally mask some of the smoother notes. That's a nitpick, really - who's having the last tipple? 1,069 charactersSargeMcCluck, May 15, 2016

A- Opens well and pours a 1" high brown head that films out in around 3-4mins or so. Very dark brown almost black colour. 
S- Nice chocolate and some heat
T- Complex to say the least. Chocolate and malt. Bourbon and Pinot barrels are there and done well. Not overpowering. Toffee and coffee abound. Lots of flavors. 
M- Creamy going down but dries right out. Quite a bit of heat. Touch thin
O- Didn't get any licorice. Huh. Not a bad brew though. Worth having once for sure

Poured into a trillium snifter, appearance is black with a nice mocha head, sticks around a bit. 
Wow nose absolutely pops out at you! molasses, dark malts, oak, cherry, licorice, very light funkiness from the wine barrels I assume. 
On the palate its sticky sweet molasses, rich burnt malts, vanilla. As it warms getting some licorice and dark fruit, almost no booze... and I was worried about drinking this fresh because others have described it as being hot! 
before trading for this beer I read quite a few reviews saying the feel is a bit thin, but I would only say that if I was being extremely picky…. thinner than only the most full bodied stouts – but by no means thin and honestly I think it coats nicely and is silky and thick. 
Overall I thought this was both interesting and good, really glad I got to try this - would love to drink an older one for comparison! 1,041 charactersHyptochrons, May 03, 2016

5.5 oz serving in a snifter.
Appears black in color and opaque until you hold it up to the light to see that it's actually dark brown around the edges of the glass with good clarity. Small dark tan head that disappears quickly. Lots of great things going on in the aroma like vanilla, cocoa, roasted/burnt malt, molasses, dark fruit, sherry, and port. These carry over to the flavor and you get some oak flavor from the barrel aging.  Full bodied, rich, heavy, and vinious. 
What a nice surprise to see this left over from the Deschutes event the night before! I'm trying to think of a comparable beer and Dogfish Head's World Wide Stout comes to mind. A great sipping beer for sure. 723 charactersJacobob10, May 02, 2016

*DISCLAIMER* This is going to be a brief review as I had this at a restaurant and wasn't paying close attention to it. I do have 2016 aging and will review that later on this year. 
Look: Black, pours with minimal to no head.
Smell: Smells great! As for specific flavors, I do not remember and it would be unfair to state a guess.
Taste: It tastes fantastic, I want to say there was some fruit notes that were present and hint of smoke as well, possibly from the barrels.
Feel: I do remember it feeling a little thin for my liking, but that did not detract from the experience.
Overall, I highly recommend obtaining this if you can. It's a great beer and will not disappoint! I will be sure to revisit this review after I've had time to enjoy one without any distractions. As always, consume responsibly! 827 charactersnyoung, Apr 23, 2016

I hear that this is better with time, and the bottle even promotes a drink after date. Very dark and attractive pour. The brown head stands tall for minutes. The nose is leading to a lot of bitter malt. Taste is pretty harsh, even with some time in the bottle. The molasses and anise are not the greatest compliment to this stout. Astringent, dirty penny and tobacco taste. Bitter chocolate comes across fairly nice. Velvety smooth. 465 charactersLloydDobler, Apr 07, 2016

4.68/5  rDev +4.5%look: 4.25 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5'15 Reserve bottle into a snifter. Pours a very dark brown, nearly black and settles completely opaque in the glass. Blacker than Al Sharpton's shoe polish. Topped off with about a finger and a half of bubbly, mocha-colored foam. Wonerful nose, wow. Roasted malt, sweet caramel, dark chocolate, molasses, warm whiskey, burnt leather, oak, dried figs, and dark fruit. Really complex and full - one of the best smelling beers I've encountered. Reminds me of BBB if it were more choclatey and smokey.
The taste is right on par with the aroma. Loads of charred, roasted malt, smokey, oaky whiskey, bitter dark chocolate, figs, juicy dark fruit, caramel, sticky molasses..the list goes on. This beer tastes like anything and everything you'd want in an imperial stout. Some folks are saying this is boozy, some say it's too sharp - nah. Mine says "best by 12/08/16", and right now it's tasting just right. There's a definite alcohol presence in the taste, but it isn't profound nor is it overpowering. I've tasted much worse in the likes of lesser ABV beers. This is hitting the sweet spot right now for sure.
In terms of the mouthfeel, yeah..it's a bit thin. But honestly, as tasty as this beast is, it really doesn't matter much. And that's not something I've ever said before. I'm usually a stickler on the mouthfeel, especially when it comes to big stouts. But this one, somehow..I just can't knock it too much. I'm honestly glad it's not overly syrupy and chewy. If that were the case, it'd be on the level of BORIS or something similar (which was a great beer, but just a lot to take in if you know what I mean). 
Frankly, I'm glad I didn't wait to drink this. I was planning to save this for my birthday in February 2017, but an extraordinarily shitty week made me crack this on a Friday night. And so it was meant to be. I don't know how the score will round out, but this may be the most satisfying imperial stout I've laid lips to yet. 1,941 charactersdo_ob, Apr 02, 2016

S:  Roast and char... dark fruits, oak and vanilla....  booze.
T/F:   Sweet charred malts and dark fruits.. fig and plum in the foreground.   A little tartness from the wine barrels... booze and vanilla from the bourbon barrels... notes of chocolate.  Complexity abounds.  This is the '15 so it's still pretty 'hot'.   Very warming and awesome at cellar temperature.
O:  A fantastic Imperial Stout from Deschutes, and they've really pushed the envelope as to what can be accomplished with the blending of different barrel aged beers and what comes together is greater than the sum of their parts.   Delicious and glad I snagged 2 more to cellar.  Can't wait to see how they age. 848 charactersEMV, Mar 28, 2016

Overall it's a must try. 370 charactersWoodBrew, Mar 26, 2016

L: 4.75  S: 4.25  T: 4  M: 4.25  O: 4
Look: This was great.  Very dark with burnt caramel head.  Can't complain here.
Smell: A lot going on here and a decent balance.  Smells bright on top of the dark malts.
Taste: This is the biggest disappointment.  For only being 20% barrel aged (11% bourbon, 6% oak, 11% pinot noir) oak came through very strong, almost as much as Oak Aged Yeti (from memory, didn't try side by side).  Molasses is noticeable and perhaps the licorice adds to the oak affect (licorice admittedly not something I like)  I took my time sipping this beer and the subtle notes  were more noticeable as it warmed.  Found some cherry and a tartness from the pinot.  More balance would make this so much better.
Mouthfeel: Second disappointment.  SImply lighter than I expected.  Again, it's only 20% barrel aged, but lighter still than Ten Fidy or Founders Imperial Stout.  Maybe the name Abyss causes me to expect more.
Overall: 2014 was my first Abyss and I'm not overwhelmed.  All that said, I'm excited for the 2015 vintage (50% BA, 21% bourbon, 8% oak, 21% wine) and the 2015 Abyss Rye.  What I tasted today will be fantastic with Rye and I will update my reviews accordingly.
Disappointed is the best way to describe it. 1,334 charactersstratusjeans, Mar 22, 2016

Finishes back with roastiness, but as it warms the barrel character becomes more pronounced and weakens the finish. Definitely a great beer but it could use more barrel character, will be seeking out both the rye whiskey and cognac versions of this, and would love to see a double barrel version. I loved this beer and think it'll be even better with age. 497 charactersScott17Taylor, Mar 19, 2016

Pours a pitch black color with a surprisingly big, spongy head.
Does smell of an earth entangled grape ripeness, which does not turn sour by any means as for a balancing, subtle integrated oak quality. A fantastic, multilayered chocolate aroma slowly evolves from scorched malts, leading to a restrained, yet enjoyable Bourbon spiciness, adding to the chocolate richness of the nose. A flowery wood bark note completes the utmost originally and well composed aromas, which get pleasantly dominated by the wine barrel and matured hops. 
Drinks with a world class mouthfeel to it, due to a huge amount of whipped cream, effectivly blending into soothing chocolate. While its carbonation is certainly on the lower end, it is still able to add a subtle, bubbly refreshment during the finish.
Tastes of chocolate dipped cherries, evolving to an even fruitier stage in which juicy, matured grapes become visible, which get wrapped up by a pungent blend of burned malts and bitter chocolate. A divine creaminess caresses the tongue while oak, licorice and burned wood bark get recognizable, tied together by a subtle wine tartness, which also produces a nice sweeter quality, enhanced by caramel and rock sugar. Cocoa nibs and matured, grassy hops provide a surprisingly aggressive hop punch during the finish, immediately soothed by the rich creaminess, while molasses, oak and milk chocolate are able to cut through.
Wow, this is certainly one of the most complex beers I've ever had, which may be due to its rich chocolate maltiness, which only gets carefully accentuated by the different barrels instead of getting dominated by them. This allows to unfold a decadent, rich creaminess, shining for its very silk mouthfeel, which finds it antagonist in dry, scorched earthen malts. 1,817 charactersaleigator, Mar 13, 2016

Palate is much the same and there's way more to the flavor profile than what initially comes across. Peat, cherry, burnt sugar, faintly tart red wine notes and plenty of chocolate. A lingering bitterness reminiscent of espresso and black licorice. 365 charactersMongrel, Mar 05, 2016

4.37/5  rDev -2.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.252015 Reserve.
A: Black as can be.  Sustained cap of khaki foam, sticky lacing.  
S: The molasses/cherry/vanilla combined to form a surprisingly sweet and candy-like aroma initially, which then gave way to the roasty wine/bourbon-influenced stout.  Smells properly good.
T: Not as intense as the bottle claims, but not far off.   Finish is heavy on oak and wine barrel, pretty dry but with a delightful lingering taste.  More sweetness and the slightest hint of bourbon up front, followed by the cherry/vanilla/fruit in the middle, before the oak really takes over again.  Pretty darned good.
F: Prickly but just enough carbonation.  Can be sort of abrasive if you don't swallow soon enough.  Bordering on thick, slightly creamy, the right viscosity for a stout like this.  
O: Solid.  Brought home from a work trip to Iowa, saw it all over the place there and only took the one bottle home. Turns out it didn't last on shelves in MI, maybe next year I'll get a couple and let one rest for a while.  Definitely approve. 1,018 charactersmatt_duthie, Feb 25, 2016

4.43/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Poured from bomber into a snifter
Appearance – The beer pours a super dark, nearly pitch black color with a two finger head of brown colored thick foam.  The head has a fantastic level of retention, slowly fading over time to rings of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.
Smell – The aroma of the beer is huge of a roasted malt smell mixed with a big showing of coffee and caramel with other notes of vanilla and chocolate being rather strong as well.  Along with the these super robust aromas, comes smells of char and smoke as well as a good showing of dark fruits of raisin and prune.  A bit of a boozy bourbon aroma is there as well, overall producing a smell that is very dark and roasty with a big showing of a warmingly sweet smell.
Taste – The taste begins as the nose would suggest with a massive dark roasted malt flavor and a good showing of coffee.  There is a huge rich milk chocolate sweetness upfront which is accompanied by other sweet flavors of molasses and brown sugar.  As the taste advances the roasted malt waivers ever so slightly, but with the coffee, is still the overall dominant taste of the brew.  With the lightening of the roastiness (which is sorta odd to write as it is still super robust in dark flavors) comes a little bit of a raisin taste as well as a decent showing of vanilla; both of which join the other sweet and chocolate flavors quite nicely.  As one may expect for a 12.2 % brew, there is a bit of a bourbon boozy taste that develops later in the tongue, which creates a nice warming feel.  Flavors of char and a woody hop develop at the very end, combining with the alcohol, roasty, and sweet nicely to create rich, dark, and warming taste to linger on the tongue.
Mouthfeel – The beer is thick and creamy with a very low level of carbonation level.  The feel is nearly perfect for the big mix of dark, sweet and boozy flavors of the brew, coating the tongue and bathing it in all the grandiose tastes of the brew.
Overall – This is a very nicely crafted imperial stout.  While slightly on the sweeter side all the other attributes of the brew match the sweeter and rich flavors very well.  Even while sweet, it not necessarily so, and was still drinkable (in a very slow sipping way) unlike some other imperial stouts of similar strength.   Overall I was rather impressed by this brew. 2,347 charactersDarkmagus82, Feb 19, 2016

Pours a deep, opaque brown, nearly black.  Thick looking, not much head with some oily cling.  Smells of roasted malts, chocolate, vanilla, molasses, a little oak, licorice as it starts to warm, a little coffee.  No bourbon presence noticed, maybe a hint of cherry from the pinot barrels.  Taste also leads with roasted malts, chocolate, more molasses and coffee than the nose, vanilla, raisins, oak.  The bourbon barrel is kind of an undertone, very subtle, the pinot adds a little bit of a fruity character.  Some bitterness hits midway through the back end.  Great flavor.  Smooth, fairly creamy, well carbonated, a tongue coater.  Great body, although lighter than typical for an RIS.  
Excellent beer, complex and well blended with lots of flavor.  I found the barrel aging to be very subtle in both aroma and taste- but contributing, and I'm shocked that some reviews call it a bourbon bomb.  In any event, bomb or hand grenade, it's a great beer, and one you should try if you can. 1,057 charactersstortore, Feb 17, 2016

It pours with a thick tan foam that slowly dissipates to a rather fascinating residue of bubbles and cascades across the surface. The body is quite dark brown, nearly black.
The smell is quite subtle: molasses and malt. Nothing much here, honestly.
The taste, however, is eat your heart out roasty! I suppose I pick up a very slight cherry and perhaps the vanilla, and maybe the wood, but it all takes a back seat to the roast. It tastes more like an hot oatmeal stout. As it warms the roasted malt balances out nicely.
Good feel. Thick, but without coating the tongue too long and lingering.
Overall, I don't find the Abyss as complex as the label suggests. The smell is too subtle and the taste is too one-dimensional. It is good though, and I intend to finish the bottle. 822 charactersimstimpy, Feb 14, 2016

Look - it was very dark, thick black, just like I expected, with a dark brown head. Beautiful pour. 
Smell - bourbon, chocolate, malt and licorice. 
Taste - malty with chocolate and licorice notes. Some vanilla, and a bit of coffee.
Feel - viscous, heavy, velvety feel.
Overall - this was a delicious beer. I love Imperial Stouts and this one did not disappoint. Very well balanced beer for 12% alcohol, and the flavor wasn't overwhelmingly alcohol. Well done Deschutes! "I'll be bock." 629 charactersTasterTester, Feb 13, 2016

The Abyss is blacker than black (completely opaque) nice carbonation with a significant tan head in a snifter. Extremely rich, lots of dark chocolate and cherries that come at the endnotes. It's interesting how only half is the beer is barrel aged; I feel that the oak wine barrels (21%) come through the most. Next time I will have to try to be more patient and heed Deschutes' consumption date advice. 485 charactersTrevor11, Feb 12, 2016

A - pitch black, thin dark brown head. Beautiful pour. S - complex.  Bourbon, chocolate, oats. T - what I expected from the smell. Very full, not overpowering, very balanced to have such a high ABV. You know you're drinking booze, but it is so well done, you could be in trouble! M - warm, light carbonation.
Just an all-round fantastic beer. Worth the price tag, and I am looking forward to Dec of 2016 to age my second bottle to see how it develops. 482 charactersjphipps83, Jan 31, 2016

Pours dark opaque as expected, with a couple fingers of mocha head. Impressive look with lively carb.
Smell: Roasted malt, red wine, graham cracker, bitter chocolate, subtle vanilla, coffee, dark fruit. Interesting and quite complex, nothing stands out immensely over the other elements.
Taste: Dark fruit with chocolate and wine up front leads into subtle vanilla and graham cracker. The finish is slightly dry from all of those barrels, with chocolate, dark fruit and red wine lingering until it rolls off of the tongue. There is a subtle bourbon undertone in the finish as well...but just a hint. Upon the first few sips, you may think that this is just a so-so beer, but once you dig in and realize the complexity that endures from the nose to the palate, it really impresses. A lot of different elements are so well integrated and nothing stands out to overpower the other...it's like drinking a fucking symphony. You can perhaps chalk it up to the aging in my case, but if you drank this blind you would never guess it was 11+%. Smoooth.
Mouthfeel: Velvety, full bodied, coats the tongue aggressively but doesn't render itself too viscous to impede you from drinking more than a sample. On the medium side of heavy, but so smooth.
Overall: Color me impressed. The red wine barrel and vanilla really integrate well with the roasted malt and chocolate elements of this. To a casual drinker, this may seem like a meh brew, but once you dig in and let it open up, you really discover what a well balanced masterpiece/classic this is. 1,564 charactersPsilohsaiBiN, Jan 30, 2016

4.74/5  rDev +5.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Aged and poured in a Firestone Walker Proprietor's Series glass.
The beer pours a very nice looking light brown cocoa color that dissipates a bit more quickly than I would like but lingers around the inside of the glass. The beer itself is an opaque dark chocolate black with a slightly oily texture. It's a very good looking beer and imperial stout when compared to other stouts since it seems to have a slight wine texture due to the alcohol.
The smell is very good. There are good strong dark chocolate notes with nice barrel notes that complement the chocolate very well. The barrel consist of bourbon, the oak, and a light vanilla note. The vanilla tends to waft underneath the entire aroma and ameliorates the wood notes a bit while the bourbon adds a nice something extra to the chocolate notes. There is also a bit of a strong wine note in the smell. The wine note has a nice berry smell and a bit of an alcohol note that you normally find in an inexpensive pinot noir. It isn't mind blowing but it certainly adds something to the aroma quite a bit.
The taste is phenomenal. The taste is in many ways much better than smell and more complex without overburdening the drinker. The taste has a very strong chocolate note that forms the center of the experience with the other notes complementing it very well. The barrel notes are not as strong as they are in the smell but they add nice bit of sweetness and wood bitterness to the chocolate that is great. The Pinot Noir notes are much more subtle but give it a slight berry note with a perfect light amount of tannin to the taste. Overall, a great taste that has come as a result of all the different notes coming to work together.
The feel is very good. It's a heavy bodied beer with some light carbonation that adds a bit of texture to it. However, the more interesting thing to note is how smooth the beer is. Apparently, the aging process has given it a wine like smoothness that is fantastic and makes it easier to drink than it ought to be.
Overall, a fantastic beer and one that will probably only get better with age when properly stored. If you can get one, go for it; especially if it's been properly aged.
Aged 2014 Vintage (2 years. Great Divide Barrel Aged Spieglau glass)
Same as the above but with a much lighter wood note and more prominent red wine note. The wine is definitely much more prominent than in a fresh bottle. The chocolate notes are even with the red and compliment very well; it's almost like eating dark chocolate immediately followed up by some red wine. The aging has definitely tamed this beer to be a lot more drinkable and confirms my theory that Deschutes beers need to be aged for quite a while.
2016 Reserve
Ditto but with a stronger wood note. 2,749 charactersHattedClassic, Jan 29, 2016

4.5/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5On tap, pours jet black with a bit of dark brown head. Smell and taste both have tons of coffee, with other dark fruit/chocolate more in the background. Not getting much in the way of barrel. Feel is medium, which feels almost a little thin for the style. Still, a little bit of thick stickiness in the finish. Enough carbonation to give it a creamy feel. A really solid imperial stout.
Updated with a 2015 bottle, consumed before its time in May 2016 (bottle says best after 12/16). I liked the fresh beer I had on tap, but some age in the bottle really helps the complexity. Initial smell is more chocolate and vanilla, along with toffee, dark cherries and dark roasted coffee. Taste follows, with a coffee finish that's got a decent bitterness. The alcohol is pretty well hidden, though alcohol legs coat the glass. Feel is thicker than what I had on tap, and appropriate to the style. Great stuff. 902 charactersBeers-es, Jan 28, 2016

Glass ware: Snifter
Serving Temperature: Approximately 50-55 degrees
Look:
Blackstrap molasses in color as it pours. Little to no head as it settles. Jet black in appearance.
Smell:
Light in smell aroma is smells slight of liquorice and vanilla
Taste:
Upfront and in your face with each sip. Can maybe taste the oak wine barrels in the at the end?
Alcohol tasteis noticeable but very smooth. Carbonation gives very pleasant refreshing feeling after each sip
Feel:
Definitely a chomper, but bitterness fads dramatically and lingers on the tong. Slick feel on the mouth
Overall:
Would definitely recommend for a stout lover or fan. First time having this beer, was bought as a gift for me. I'm definitely gonna have to search for one to age a year as recommended on the bottle. I drank this one fresh. This one says best after 12/0816. So would be a great Christmas-eve or day beer. 962 charactersMikeybricks, Jan 26, 2016

This is the 2015 release. It was great but to early in my opinion to have drank it.  I bribed the SO with allowing me to spend extra money on it this week if we could drink it.  It was really really enjoyable, however I would like to see how it ages.  Got a 4.5 in my book right now.  A lot of spicey earthiness while also being sweet and fruity. I liked the balance but  I want to see how it evolves.

Pours jet black, skinny dark brown head, light carbonation.  Huge chocolate, malt, coffee, vanilla, and booze on the nose.  Slight hint of licorice.  Flavor profile follows suit, with barrel characteristics coming through.  This is a heavy, viscous beer that's meant to be savored.  Absolutely wonderful. 354 characterswdberkley, Jan 12, 2016

4.21/5  rDev -6%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Pours a dark black color, with a small light brown (hell, I'd almost say orange) head. Few visible signs of carbonation, besides the occasional minimal rising bubble. The clear black color makes my glass look like a mirror when looking at it. When I hold the glass up and look straight at it, it looks identical to the way my computer screen looks when I've turned my computer off at night. It almost feels like it has no appearance at all, and that the innards of my essence is being reflected by a beer glass.
Smells of licorice, roasted coffee beans, wine, chocolate. Overall, a very full aroma. 
The taste is definitely heavy on the roasted flavor, the coffee and chocolate complements each other nicely as neither dominates. I get quite a bit of plum, licorice, and notes of vanilla as well. This beer really does have a fascinating contrast between the sweetness of the chocolate and vanilla, and the bitterness from the smoked flavor and licorice. Very rich flavor, with a large degree of nuance. Mouthfeel is full and satisfying.
 I really really liked this beer, but I might have fallen in love with its appearance. This is a perfect looking beer, which makes the fact that it only tastes like a pretty damn good beer slightly disappointing. In either case, this is a very good stout. 1,296 charactersWer34truh, Jan 11, 2016

4.13/5  rDev -7.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25Poured rich dark black with one inch tan head that had excellent retention and lacing. Scent was chocolate, roasted malt, dried fruit/raisin, with slight wine and oak... no bourbon notes. Flavor was heavily roasted malt, vanilla, chocolate, raisins, heavy on the oak and subtle wine. I didn't notice any bourbon heat. Personally, I didn't like how the wine added to the flavor and felt it could have benefitted from deeper bourbon notes. Overrall, incredibly complex and unique beer! 2015 version. 497 charactersUmdrunner, Jan 09, 2016

Smell: Malt, licorice, plum (?). Mild. Fine. Expected deeper smell after seeing the dense dark color.
Taste: malt, licorice, molasses. Sweet and bitter simultaneously. Holy crap, this is dense, intense stuff. Demands your full attention.
Feel: Rather rich, corresponding to the deep color and taste.
Overall: Nice, well integrated finish. Long, licorice. Moderately intense.
This is a really nice beer - more for a special occasion, the flavor is unusual - wouldn't fit in my regular rotation - but really nice. 691 charactersJeffsta1, Jan 07, 2016

2014 reserve served on 2015 new years eve.
22 ounce bottle served in a pint glass.
Smells awesome... dark roasted caramel malts, chocolate, coffee and bourbon.
Taste... well, like an imperial stout should along with a bourbon explosion. This is without a doubt the strongest tasting bourbon aged beer I've had (and I've had about 30 variations of them).
If you don't like bourbon, you wont like this beer. 
Fantastic beer, just a little expensive. 481 charactersGlanzman, Jan 04, 2016

Glass: Clear plastic juice glass
From: Barons Market in Alpine, Calif.
Price: $16.99
Purchased: Jan. 7, 2015
Consumed: Dec. 31, 2015
Misc.: Best after Nov. 11, 2015; 2014 vintage
Poured a pitch black color with two fingers of fizzy tan head. Below average spotty lacing on the sides of the glass. Below average retention. (Sight - 4.00)
Smelled boozy chocolate, roasted toffee, dark caramel, oaky vanilla, dark fruits, mainly purple grape, plum and black raspberry, dark wet cocoa, molasses, wintry spices, light licorice and faint roasty malts. (Smell - 4.50)  
First taste reminded me of a slightly stronger Obsidian Stout or Black Butte Porter. Got roasted dark chocolate, toffee, caramel, dark fruits - black raspberry and purple grape - molasses, smoky fire, char wood, oaky vanilla and licorice. (Taste - 4.25)
Full body. Sticky texture. Average carbonation. Long, smooth finish. (Feel - 4.50)
This was a very good imperial stout, but not as good as I hoped. Can’t get over how close it is to Obsidian Stout and Black Butter Porter. Would have it again though, but not for $16.99. (Overall - 4.25)

(2014 Reserve -- best after 11/10/15 printed on bottle, 11.1% ABV)
L:  motor oil out of the bottle, very dark and thick, hard to tell if it's clear ... might be deepest darkest brown up to light; pushes up short head, only 1/2-inch tall, but super thick and super sticky, nice tan/light brown color; only a tiny bit of lacing, keeps a thin collar of brown foam
S:  juicy dark fruits and red wine ... fruitcake ... some cherry ... a little oak wood, but the sweetness is supreme here, big vanilla really controlling the scene now with the dark fruits/red wine/cherry branching off that vanilla ... either I'm off or that's some of the sweetest oak you'll ever smell, almost like cedar, just flowery as can be ... wow ... suddenly all the bourbon hits, very sweet like a chocolate/vanilla swirl milkshake topped with bourbon
T:  chocolate ... lots of chocolate with a burnt bitter finish, like chewing on roasted coffee beans; yes, very bitter, some licorice, lots of burnt wood, burnt oak, burnt hops (?) ... but with the big sweet taste of chocolate, the flavor is balancing well; some red wine/cherry/fruity flavor enveloped in the darker flavors; as it warms, the bitterness is subsiding and letting more sweetness in, even some of that vanilla that's in the aroma
F:  relatively light for such a big brew, but it's well carbonated and filling ... perhaps a perfect midweight
O:  a more bitter barrel-aged stout than many I've tried, but it's not to the detriment of anything ... there's a great chocolate backbone of flavor from which springs some fruity flavors (dark fruits and red wine), some of that bitterness and a bit of coffee/espresso to mix for a very pleasant sipper; the bourbon aroma is subtle, bourbon flavor even more so, but the way it mixes in with all that sweetness is nice.
without question a beer I will revisit ... maybe even another of these 2014 Reserves. 1,928 charactersPremo88, Jan 02, 2016

Abyss pours a pitch black with a beautiful, thick brown head that lingers. It has aromas of oak and wine and licorice, with a hint of chocolate or vanilla. A lot of the flavor notes are the same as the aroma. Though I'm not sure I can pick out every different type of oak used, the fact they varied it is evident in the nuance and subtlety of flavors. Abyss feels thick and creamy on the tongue, and has a surprisingly pleasant amount of carbonation.
Overall, a top notch stout from Deschutes. 555 charactersjosephandbrown, Dec 30, 2015

The taste is from the wine barrel side of this beer IMO a certain bitterness imparted from this side of the aging and also some of the dark fruits shine through. The mouthfeel is smooth and even towards the thick side but most enjoyable. Another great stout I'm glad to have had the chance to enjoy. 515 characterssmanson56, Dec 29, 2015

Smell is of roast and char, sweet malt and maybe a hint of licorice. Taste explodes with dark complexity. Tobacco and leather join the perfectly roasted malt sweetness. As the beer falls to the side of my tongue vanilla fills my senses. A faint but appropriate amount of bourbon rounds out the finish, but never overpowers the rest of this experience.  Mouth feel is thick and viscous, with a light carbonation, and slick residue after the swallow. This is a beer to be savored, and is truly remarkable to see in verticals. 2015 is one of the better ones have had so far. 630 charactersGoneARye, Dec 28, 2015

Poured into a Kentucky Bourbon Barrel Ale mini snifter.
A - Viscous jet black pour. Less than a finger of dark tan head. Lots of good thin sticky lacing.
S - An interesting and unique aroma. The molasses & licorice are very present. Notes of tart cherry juice and wood / barrel aging melds together.  Subtle vanilla and wine tannins are also there.
T - Warming alcohol, molasses / licorice spicing, notes of roast / char. Has a bit of hot, almost peppery sort of spice present, but perhaps it is just the booze heat. The subtle wine / grapes become more pronounced as the beer warms toward room temperature.
M - Feel is smooth, thick, creamy, heavy. Alcohol afterburn is still present.
Overall, unique & interesting, but probably not something I would actively seek out every year.  Worth the try, but I will probably pass on it in the future.

4.29/5  rDev -4.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.252014 release. Pours a solid black with a thick light brown head. The nose is dark fruit, chocolate, oak and roasted malts. The first taste offers loads of complexities with fruit, oak, chocolate, and licorice coming through. The bourbon and wine aren't overly obvious, but peak through in each sip. The mouthfeel is extremely thick and is just what I'm looking for. Overall, it's good, but I think my other bottle is going to sit for a few more years. 451 characterszimm421, Dec 24, 2015

L - Deepest brown color with no light getting through.  Dark brown, creamy head and lace.
S - Wonderful aroma of boozy coffee liquor and bourbon barrels.
T - Coffee stout, chocolate, earthy hops.  Huge punch of bitterness. Bourbon, oak in the finish.
F -  Heavy body but velvety smooth mouthfeel and carbonation.  Strong alcohol burn, but not out of line with the other strong flavors and sensations.
O - A massive, boozy, oaky bomb, but oh so tasty! 488 charactersRadome, Dec 19, 2015

4.23/5  rDev -5.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5I genuinely do not understand how this beer is rated so highly. It tastes like bitter ash. I've probably had about 100 other BA stouts that'd prefer to drink over this. 
It's got a great mouthfeel. The flavor is complex and more unique than most BA stouts. But it's just not that enjoyable. As far as I can tell, everybody that likes it is a smoker that can handle this much ashtray in their mouths, and I'm just not desensitized to that taste. Or maybe they're drinking it after 2+ years instead of just one? 510 charactersElumbeer, Dec 14, 2015

4.09/5  rDev -8.7%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 42014 variant. Pours a dark viscous black color with a slight brown head which dissipates quickly. Initial nose is large amount of tanin masked quickly by bourbon notes. Taste is complex and ever changing from bourbon to chocolate and finishes with a dark grain flavor. Overall a good stout which was worth a try, but the wine tanins play too much of an over powering factor. Going to age another '14 for a year to see how this changes. 435 charactersDsntMatter, Dec 12, 2015

4.08/5  rDev -8.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Poured 2014 vintage into a tulip at 60 degrees. Pours a rich black color with mocha-tinted head and nice lacing. Pretty beer. Smell is chocolate, oak, molasses, booze, licorice, and bit of soy. Taste is molasses, oak, tannin, smoke, dark fruit, slight licorice. First few sips were all smoke, things got more "complex" as it warmed further and my palate adjusted. Mouth is nice and chewy; you can tell its 11% in the feel if not the taste.
I'm mixed on this beer. TBH, I had hoped for more given the hype. Its nice and complex, but I'd also have to say that the smoke and tannin dominate for me and those aren't the things I was looking for. I'll sit on my second bottle for a few more years (right?) and see what happens. I'd also try it again given the year-to-year variance. But IMO, there are quite a few imperial stouts--especially after a year of cellaring--that surpass this for the money. 897 charactersAppaZappa, Dec 08, 2015

*This review is based on fresh Abyss, but the review below is specific to 2007, in order to inform everyone how the beer is still drinking
A: Faint chocolate, malt aromas, followed by very light wood.
A: Deep brown color, hazy although somewhat clear with a very thin head.
T: Faint chocolate with complex, rich malt character, light wood with a slight soy sauce note.  The beer has a light bitterness on the finish
M: Medium-full bodied with light carbonation.
O: The 2007 is definitely on the tail-end of drinkability, but still tasty enough to drink!  The beer has lost a lot of its deep chocolate notes, but the malts have developed a complex character that’s complimented by the faint oak.  Unfortunately, the beer has slight autolysis and has picked up a bit of a soy sauce note. 804 charactersPhil-Fresh, Dec 01, 2015

Look - Dark brown with a half finger of khaki head. It settled to a ring very quickly after slowly developing. Lacing is blotchy. 
Smell - Chocolate. Tobacco. Bourbon. Vanilla. Licorice. Chocolate. Fruit.
Taste - Drink it cold and it tastes almost like a barely wine. Let it warm and it is apparent it is a stout. Follows the nose. This is so complex. 
Feel - Finishes dry. No alcohol burn. Medium carbonation. Chewy feel.
Overall - There are good barley wines, good sweet stouts, and good dry stouts. This is all of those. It is complex and worth the wait. I hope I pick up a 2015 in late 2016 like I did the 2014. 690 charactersmadelfonatree, Dec 01, 2015

I was so thrilled to find the 2014 on tap during Black Friday shopping. 
This is perhaps the darkest Stout I have ever poured with a beautiful caramel head and lovely lacing down the side of the glass. The aroma is nice--boozy and lots of coffee in the nose. The mouthfeel was much thinner than expected. Too much hot alcohol and bitter coffee on the palette.  All the pieces you would expect from a big Stout we're present, but out of balance. 549 charactersmawelge, Nov 29, 2015

4.08/5  rDev -8.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Well what this is all about depends on vintage.  Almost universally, the older bottles were better because a greater percentage of the beer was aged in barrels instead of adding shit like cherry bark like they did in recent years.
Abyss like black, but not the darkest I've ever seen.  Aroma, dependent on year.  Not super bourbony though that is for sure. 357 charactersrodbeermunch, Nov 27, 2015

Taste is licorice, roasted malts and the molasses. I would love to have had more oak but here we are
Mouthfeel is silky and thick with light carbonation 
Overall a delicious stout.  I'm glad I have another to sit on for a while! 357 characters2ellas, Nov 27, 2015

As it warms up the roasted character never leaves.  Not getting a lot of licorice, but for me that's a plus because I'm not a licorice fan. 364 charactersjvivino, Nov 26, 2015

Wow just amazing stuff. Aged at room temp since purchase.The Nose is of oak and molasses and dark fruits. The taste is of black cherries molasses oak and vanilla. The mouth feel is full and sticky with a red wine like finish, with a slight alcohol heat. To sum it up this is a amazing beer that I plan on buying multiple bottles of every year from now on. So glad I have another I have been letting sit in the back of the fridge I will hang onto it for quite awhile longer just to see where this adventure goes. So far this is a cellar king. 569 charactersRootscipio, Nov 16, 2015

It is a 2014 bottle best after11/10/15
A:  Pours beautifully, black and thick like used motor oil a finger worth of mocha foam sits on top.
S: figs an bourbon.  Hints of coffee and chocolate as it warms
T:  get some of that dog I smelt, but the taste of leather, tobacco and charred coffee dominate
MF: Cheery and lingering.  Some sweetness hides in there
O:  Not my favorite.  The dominance of the charred coffee and Tobacco is a  Little off putting for me.  I get what they are doing but it isn't my cup of tea. 580 charactersSammyJaxxxx, Nov 16, 2015

Poured from bomber into Simon Pearce tulip
Look: thick, oily black. 2 inch brown head, dissipated over a few minutes
Smell: sweetness of fruit. Plums. Coffee.
Taste: Raisins, bitterness of coffee on the finish. A bit of tobacco. 
Feel: Not overly oily, leans more towards dry (as far as the style goes). Almost a tart finish
Overall: A year on it, has developed well. Would be excellent with a cigar. 459 charactersTrojanRB, Nov 16, 2015

Best after 08/16/14
a: thick, frothy dark mocha head which subsides quite quickly to a thin layer.  Very dark in appearance but doesn't seem black but rather a dark, dark, dark mahogany
s: cherry & dark chocolate seem most prominent.  As it warms very slight notes of vanilla start coming through.
t: black molasses & licorice come through strongly at the start.  Heavy dark (slightly bitter) chocolate at the finish.  Cherry is very modest & not as prominent as it is on the aroma.  Not getting any oak/bourbon at all but do get some vinous aspects showing through.
m: medium carbonation.  Seems spot on to me.  Finishes a touch dry but not an issue in any way
o:  First timing have The Abyss.  Ideally I should have tried a bottle fresh for comparison's sake.  This is a well crafted beer and there is quite a bit going on in this beer & mostly everything seems complementary.  Hardly any oak or bourbon presence but given those were only 17% of the mix I'm not totally surprised.  This bottle at this moment of time seems to be primarily dark chocolate and the bitterness associated with dark chocolate.  Akin to eating an 88% dark chocolate bar is the best I can put it.  Accents of the cherry bark & some vinous presence are there as well at a secondary level.  In summary, glad I tried it and I think it's something all craft beer fans should try at least once.  It's a great sipper 1,401 charactersJaycase, Nov 16, 2015

4.44/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.52014 release sampled as part of the BA mass tasting. Pours the deepest brown one can imagine without calling it black, accompanied by a light dusting of cocoa-colored head that quickly flits to the edge of the glass. 
The aroma has an outsize influence from the wine barrels and licorice, with strong vinous notes and bitter tannins leading an entourage of molasses, burnt caramel, cocoa, and dark roasted malts. I actually sniffed so deeply in the glass that I wet my nose. One bashful swipe of a napkin later, and I'm ready for a sip. 
Here, the flavors have calmed down a bit from when I had this fresh a year ago. Anise and stone fruit, dipped in dark chocolate, are most prominent. There are plenty of accents from the oak barrels themselves, along with some spicy pepper and heat from the bourbon. The vanilla is pretty subdued at this point. The body is moderately full but thinner than some of its contemporaries in the licorice, vinous stout category such as Black Albert.
Outstanding, and what a great excuse to crack a bottle open. 1,045 charactersdarktronica, Nov 15, 2015
5/5  rDev +11.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I'm not sure this beer is a perfect 100 for everyone but it is for me. I drank the 2014 vintage. Dark as night, awesome cocoa colored head and impressive lacing for a big stout. The amount going on in the nose and taste of this beer is ridiculous. Smells like wine, oak, coffee, molasses, chocolate, bourbon, tart cherries and roasted malt sweetness. The flavor is a very well balanced version of the aromas. I notice the wine, oak and licorice more in the taste than in the nose and there is a very nice finish that tastes like tart cherries and bitter black licorice. This is a really superbly crafted beer that is a must have for any beer drinker. 650 charactersFriedSlug, Nov 15, 2015

A: Pours black with a mocha colored head, head is full with lots of tiny bubbles, after five minutes, head was gone, reduced to a chocolate colored film, no carbonation streaming, looks thin.
A: Pinot noir barrels come through pretty strong, hint of bourbon, chocolate, picking up some tart cherry aromas, some roasted malts and coffee notes, lots of aromas, complex, nothing really jumps out besides the pinot noir barrels yet all these aromas are there.
T: Like the nose, pinot noir barrels are the dominating flavor, some bourbon, coffee and dark chocolate moderate bitterness in the middle, finishes with cherry, licorice, and molasses sweetness, wine barrel aftertaste, dry finish. 
M: For an imperial stout, it’s a little thin, good amount of carbonation, dry coffee like finish.
O: First off, like the Dissident, nothing in The Abyss jumps out at me, however, it has a very complex aroma and taste, everything in The Abyss is subtle, maybe because it’s aged, I don’t know, but it’s very good and drinkable, a fireside lounge chair beer. 1,094 charactersBrolo75, Nov 15, 2015

As black as the Abyss must be with no highlights that I can see.  Small dense very dark head with tons of sticky spotty lacing.
Deep dark aroma too.  Soft and smooth roast with a richness that moves every so closely to the soy sauce, without crossing and no distaste for me.  Hints of the oak and bourbon but soft and blended. 
For the lightness of the aroma (at a cooler temperature) there is a complexity and richness in the drink that is ever so nice.  Really dries out with the lingering roast and still some hoppy bitterness, alcohol/bourbon lingering a good long time.   Immediate richness just fills the tastebuds completely.   Tasty roast, deep fruit, a  tempered hoppy bitterness (still evident but I'm sure it was stronger before), but still a stream of grassy hop flavor, less of the soy sauce but still a hint, seems like the roast goes towards some nice coffee and a nice streak of sweetness that has a caramel but it's blended in with a little vanilla from the oak.
Nice full feel.  Very soft and enough carbonation to create a nice fullness.  Nearly exceptional feel.
Not sure why I hung onto this so long.  I guess I never found the time.  Aging seems to have had minimal impact except probably reducing the intensity.  No off flavors from time.  Very enjoyable. 1,345 charactersgarymuchow, Nov 15, 2015

Very sweet aroma, I picked up a lot of the molasses / burnt sugar mixed in with some rum raisin, dark chocolate & raspberry. The aroma is deceptive however. It is a little  smokey upfront, definitely a burnt chocolate / dark coffee vibe, licorice is noticeable as well. The oak / wood opens up as the beer sits for a few minutes, adding another deep husky note to the brew, along with a little vanilla from the bourbon barrel (again with a palatable husky, robust note).  In fact, the wine oak is really the lingering note on this, and it stays on your tongue for quite awhile.   It is a very dense, thick stout with lots of flavor notes to consider, but it was a little far on the smokey wood side of things for my own personal taste. Still a must-try and one of the most interesting beers out there. 885 charactersajm5108, Nov 14, 2015

Ashy and smokey top notes. Very acrid and woody. Licorice. Dry chocolate. Molasses sweetness pulls through more as it warms. Warming boozy and vinous back end. Slick and syrupy feel with some mildly sharp seltzery carbonation.
I've enjoyed two separate vintages of Abyss in the past, but this one is a little harsh in all respects. 385 charactersryan1788a5, Nov 12, 2015

Poured into a snifter, beautiful black and deep as the name implies. One finger of cocoa colored head that resedes to a thin layer stubbornly clinging to the glass. 
Scent is strong and predominantly woody.  More subtle and pleasant overtones of anise, dark chocolate and molasses fill in to offer the nose a complex experience that keeps you sniffin more than sippin. 
Taste is true to the nose, still very woody. The molasses really staples the beer to your tongue while there is a fine warming licorice flavor that carries it through the palette.  If you try this beer, do yourself a favor and drink it real slow, the complexity of the flavor really shines as it comes to room temperature. 
Mouthfeel has a surprising amount of carbonation for an aged beer. It's sticky and really clings to the tongue. 
I was expecting a decent beer, and at the price point I was honestly ready to be disappointed, but was not.  This is truly a great beer, worthy of a one time spurge if the budget makes it tough to pull off.  I will purchase again, but will probably age a little longer. 1,093 charactersBonsall_Phil, Nov 03, 2015

Color is black and opaque, with a thin khaki head.  Lots of lacing.  Smell is delicious - dark fruits, anise, coffee, cherry and cocoa.  Taste is very similar to the nose - lots of dark fruit giving way to some nice bitterness from the hops and dark roasted malt.  Body is full with mild carbonation - really coats the mouth with its richness.  Overall, a great BA beer. 413 charactersmr-jj, Oct 31, 2015

Wine, cherry, and oak on the nose, mingling with bourbon. Chocolate lurks tantalizingly behind.
Barrels are front and center on the palate, as well, although massive roasty notes of dark, bitter chocolate and coffee soon follow. The blend is definitely odd; it's almost a boozy chocolate covered cherry.
As it warms, much more dark cocoa comes out front and center, along with some aggressively bitter hops. Meanwhile, the barrel dominance settles into a smooth, relaxed stance.
Very long, hot finish, with lingering chocolate. Lively and full bodied.

5/5  rDev +11.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This review is of the 2014 vintage.  I'll be honest about my bias up front: this is my favorite beer, period.  Pours pitch black with a mocha head.  Smell is complex, with hints of chocolate, licorice, coffee, and cherry.  Taste is equally complex, with the coffee of the nose receding a bit as the cherry expands into a deeper, richer, dark fruit taste.  Like many good, complex beers, the complexity only expands as the beer warms.  Mouthfeel is thick and rich, like an imperial stout of this caliber should be.  After trying the initial 4-5 ounces in isolation, I had the remainder paired with a dark chocolate-cardamom-cherry-ginger cake.  This beer is a meal (with dessert) in itself, so no need to pair, but if so, it definitely matches complex, savory desserts well.  Could not recommend more highly. 807 charactersLAp, Sep 12, 2015
4.52/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Give this beer at least six months before cracking it. It truly needs that time before it has any chance of coming together. But when it does, it does. And it's still great, despite its having become ubiquitous in a number of markets. 234 charactersEdwardAbbey, Sep 11, 2015

4.5/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.516 oz pint on draft at River City Drafthouse, Louisville, KY
A: Deep, pitch black body; dark mocha head about a finger and a half thick when it arrives at the table; good head retention.
S: One can definitely tell this is a barrel-aged stout from the get go as the woody/oak presence announces itself up front; roasted notes in the vein of fresh ground coffee, breakfast toast; dark chocolate; dark fruits.
T:  Palate is greeted with an initial dose of oak, which wraps around a strong, roasted bitterness akin to french press coffee; dark chocolate adds a moderating dose of sweetness before a flash of dark fruits (cherry, raisin) breaks through, adding a nice, vinous character; earthy, maybe even a touch of tobacco; the oak really opens up as the glass warms, and I start to detect faint hints of caramel and vanilla late on.  Really enjoyable.
M: Creamy mouthfeel accentuates the complexities on the palate.
O: Fantastic. Great barrel aging qualities - oaky, toasty, dark chocolate and dark fruit, wine-like characteristics.  A kiss of spiciness from the booze on the finish but the ABV is kept well in check. A wonderful package for all lovers of stouts and barrel-aged beers. 1,189 charactersBuschyfor3, Sep 06, 2015

I have a fresh bottle I'm waiting a few more months on and will try soon.  The 2011 vintage had very little in terms of complexity for me, smelled like coffee with very light licorice, tasted like liquid smoke.  The biggest highlight was the look which was significantly better than any other part.  Overall this was a letdown.  I hope to revisit this review when I open the fresh bottle. 483 characterschasisthedevil, Aug 27, 2015

Appearance: Pours pitch black with a thick head of tan foam. 
Smell: Light smokey/roasted smell with the faintest trace of bourbon. 
Taste: Smokey and roasted, prominent flavors of rich dark chocolate with the slightest hint of bourbon and licorice. Really just not sure how I feel about the balance of flavors
Mouthfeel: not too thick, but still very rich. An incredibly smooth beer 
Overall: a complex beer that may need to be aged longer before I can enjoy it properly. 554 charactersincandenza, Aug 25, 2015

4.28/5  rDev -4.5%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25First bottle was $18. Didn't want to drink it, so went back to the restaurant in Sandusky, Ohio after a second visit to Cedar Point where I got the first one and was given the next one for just $10. Massive thanks to the owner of the restaurant for this one. I've been looking forward to this beer for quite a long time... and now I have a base to compare my next bottle to in a year or two. Both bottles have a 11/10/15 "best after" date, so I'm breaking some rules drinking this one early.
Appearance: Pours what I'd expect -- a pitch black color with a surprising finger of a creamy, dark brown head... it's called The Abyss for a reason. Sipping down the glass there's actually quite a bit of very nice thick lacing. This is a beautiful looking beer, especially at 11% ABV.
Smell: Man, is that ever interesting... this is an Imperial Stout you need to smell to really understand. Though the bottle says this beer is only aged 11% in wine barrels, I'm getting a significant amount of wine on the nose -- it's a definite, readily apparent warming-to-the-nose, dark red wine smell. There is the slightest hint of oak in there, but I can't say I smell any actual bourbon from the bourbon barrel aging, which is a bummer, for sure. The wine aroma seems to be the most pronounced thing, at least to my nose, and then a deep roasted coffee kind of vibe as well. Of course, this beer smells pretty damn boozy. I can feel the warmth in my nose. I may also get a little bit of the licorice that's listed on the label, but it's faint. There's also apparently molasses and cherry bark in here, but I don't get the former, at least. The cherry bark may be adding to that fruit and roast aroma. I enjoy the smell of this beer, but I feel like the wine manages to take the forefront, which is both surprising and a bit disappointing.
Taste/feel: This is quite a lot different than the smell, and honestly, a letdown. All the flavors coming together makes this beer a bit of a mess, in my opinion, but thanks to Deschutes' ridiculous brewing expertise, it manages to still taste pretty damn good regardless. This beer hits with some alcohol and wine tartness right away. A little oakiness comes in through the middle, and the beer finishes extremely roasty... too roasty. Honestly, like-burned roast, and it sort of gives me an off-putting almost acrid bitterness. The very end of this beer has a deep, deep, deep coffee roast vibe. I mean like putting a teaspoon of coffee rinds in your mouth sort of bitterness, and it keeps me coming back to the beer for all the wrong reasons. I really shouldn't be wanting to get a flavor out of my mouth. I mean I guess I'm fluffing it a bit... it's not THAT bad, but it's certainly not something I enjoy. The feel is actually not super full-bodied -- it's moderately high in body with a pretty pleasant carbonation that is super subtle and barely there.
I enjoy this beer a fair amount, but I am definitely not blown away. The Abyss just has too much of a wine barrel vibe to it. While I can certainly enjoy some beers aged in wine barrels, this one would likely be better without it. It goes in with all the flavors meddling together in a not-so-great fashion, and finishes with a bit of an off-putting intense burnt coffee bitterness. I would certainly recommend trying this beer simply because it's one of the most loved beers on this site, but I would recommend more-so drinking this beer after its "drink after" date, which I intend to do with my second bottle. Hopefully by then that intense bitterness mellows out, and I expect it to. Very good beer, Deschutes, but you definitely have done better work... I may be the only person in the world who prefers Black Butte XXVI to this beer, at least right now. I'll edit this review when I have my second bottle of The Abyss in a year or so.
Mid-bottle update: As the beer's warmed up after about forty minutes or so, the wine barrel-y nose has changed a lot. Suddenly I get more of a milk chocolate sort of aroma with a fair amount of oak and a little more bourbon. There's definitely some dark fruit in there as well, which only adds depth. Adding a quarter of a point to my smell rating because of that. Additionally, the intense roast bitterness fades a tick. It is still very strong, but it detensifies as it warms. For that reason, I'm giving the taste and overall ratings a quarter of a point bump up as well... I should have known not to drink this beer immediately out of the fridge. Its sweet spot seems to be about 40 minutes at room temperature before drinking. 4,559 charactersSerialTicker, Aug 07, 2015

I respect it. It is beautiful in the glass, I feel it simply has too much going on. This is the 2014 consumed in 2014. Poured into a smallish snifter type glass. Consumed from chilled, about 45 up to room temp.
I have another 2014 in reserve I'll try later this year.
A = deep black, it is the Abyss after all
T = burgundy, dessert liquor, licorice, chocolate, cherry, woody taste, reminder me of a beer version of German dark chocolate brandy-filled 'beans'

It should be on your bucket list if you're a fan of the dark, well  worth tracking down. First year it was good but not exceptional. Two years later it started having more complex flavor and mouthfeel. By 2014 it's hands down the best stout I've enjoyed . Looking  forward to cracking a 2014 vintage in a few years to see how it compares. 407 charactersJconradt, Jul 12, 2015

(Revisit 11/2015-5 days after indicated, sipped a bit colder than initial review)
Found an extra bottle, so decided to pop one before it indicates.  Will revisit the review when I have it aged "appropriately".
Pour black with thick bubbly head growing high on a somewhat vigorous pour.  The brown head reduces to a foamy ring, with a gossamer coverage of the surface of the beer.  Lacing is significant.  Very nice.
(Revisit: same, head seems a bit fuller than originally indicated)
Nose is dark chocolate with a hint of smoke, a cocoa (hot chocolate) smell with perhaps a hint of vanilla.  I also get a very light hint of alcohol, and also a light cherry-like note.
(Revisit: more raisin, really, with licorice, alcohol, molasses; grape/wine notes grow with warmth)
(Revisit on taste:
Raisin, dark alcohol-soaked fruit bread, licorice initially, with a definite but letting tart fruit bite
Warmth brings out wood, tannins, red wine, grape, berry hints.)
Original taste notes:
Taste hits on dark roast coffee and the oak up front.  These somehow come together to give me a dark chocolate taste.  I also get a tart note that I think was the cherry-ish smell I got, but I can see being the wine influence, as there is also a tannin-like dryness that comes with it.  The beer is smooth throughout, and the flavor is thick/deep, but the feel is not.  Carbonation is so light, but nicely so, I this case.  I think perhaps the bourbon/alcohol influence add a nice level of heat to cover for any lacking tingle of carbonation.  That said, the bourbon taste is nicely hidden, and is far from the forefront flavor for this beer.  Edit: when the beer warms close to room temperature, the cherry comes out a bit.
(Revisit feel: pretty full and coating, but not overly thick.  Light carbonation, but tannic dryness that leaves my tongue a tad thirsty)
Definitely a wonderful beer.  I opened this after limited time in fridge, so it was proper temp at the time, I think, by accident.  Can't wait to try the next bottle.
The next bottle seemed to lean more on the wine barrel aging than my original review indicates.  Re-reading the description, about the only thing that doesn't come out much is the bourbon in this 2014 bottle. 2,253 characterscjgiant, Jul 08, 2015

Tastes of caramel, molasses, smoke, and spice with a creamy thick mouth-feel that is absolutely outstanding.  This is one of the best brews I've had the privilege of tasting. 274 charactersPrasm, Jun 29, 2015

Appearance: Pours a dark brown (black once in the glass) with 2+ fingers of a dark tan, creamy head with good retention. Body is opaque. 
Smell: Roasted malt, chocolate, butterscotch, toffee, vanilla with a hint of bourbon.
Taste: Roasted malt, coffee, black licorice, hint of black currant. Theres an odd, strong bitterness that lingers long after the finish and is somewhat off-putting.
Mouthfeel: Fuller end of medium bodied with a somewhat creamy mouthfeel and medium carbonation. 
Overall: Good, but definitely doesn't live up to its ratings. The weird bitterness also detracts a bit from it as well. 682 charactersJonada, Jun 23, 2015

4.99/5  rDev +11.4%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 522 oz bottle, 2013 vintage, poured into a goblet
Appearance:  Pours a gorgeous, completely opaque, pitch-black color with a half of a finger of caramel-colored head that quickly dissolved away into a thin lacing of foam that partially covered the top of the beer.
Aroma:  Wow!  Delicious, earthy, rich, inviting!  Massive aromas of roasted malt, imparting notes of freshly baked dark bread, followed by tons of molasses, brown sugar, licorice, hints of coffee, smoke, wood and vanilla.  Complex and delicious.
Taste:  Wow!  Just…wow!  Spectacular!  Phenomenal!  Outstanding!  Exactly like the beer’s aroma.  Massive aromas of roasted malt, imparting notes of freshly baked dark bread, followed by tons of molasses, brown sugar, licorice, hints of coffee, smoke, wood and vanilla.  Complex, earthy, rich, inviting and delicious!
Mouthfeel:  Chewy and smooth as there is no carbonation what-so-ever.  With an ABV of 11.0%, there is amazingly, very little in the way of alcohol on the palate.  The alcohol is incredibly well masked.
Overall:  This is a spectacular American Imperial Stout!  Complex, rich, earthy, amazing!  One of the best beers I’ve ever had!  I totally understand the hype this beer has. 1,214 charactersJeffreysan, Jun 12, 2015

Smell - Smooth bourbony chocolate nose. 
Taste - The initial taste was very dark chocolate. Cherries, oak, molasses. Toward the back, the beer is dry chocolate with a slight warming sensation. 
Mouthfeel - The low carbonation allows the stout to stick to the roof of the mouth. 
Overall - This is a great stout. I would be hesitant to call it elite. 430 charactersJohnnyHopps, May 24, 2015

On tap at The Blue Moon for MCBW, which has been the best event of the week, by far, I might add. Good work, Blue Moon!
I'm having this next to KBS and Black Butte XXVI, and I have to say this is the best of the three. Man, wow! (I'm actually surprised by how less blown away I am by the KBS.)

Appearance: Completely dark, name describes this well. 
Smell: This was a winner. Even after some months in the fridge, there was a good amount of bourbon on the nose. There was a sweetness from the vanilla as well.
Taste: Bourbon hits first, which is followed by dark chocolate and coffee. There was surprisingly no burn that followed from the bourbon. The vanilla comes through, but more on the nose, than taste. The big sweetness is from the molasses, which is very distinguished. At the end there was quite a lot of cherries. I felt as the beer warmed, I tasted this more.
Feel: very soft feel, for this abv I was surprised it wasn't more viscous. 
Overall: With all hyped beers I like to keep an open mind, but this one lives up to the hype. Definitely one of the best in its class. 828 charactersRStaff4, May 10, 2015

No barrel character either. I realize it is expressly stated that the beer sit a year before being consumed, but I'm not sure how much better 6 more months or even two more years can make this. 301 charactersMoses_Malone, May 08, 2015

4.47/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5In 2010, I had bought a bottle of The Abyss that was apparently part of the 2009 batch that was determined to be infected.  This is the first time since then that I have seen it on the shelf here in Central Texas, bought two 22 oz bombers for $16 each.  Label says "best after 11/10/15".  I'm going to drink one now and let the other stew until November, at which point I will revisit this review.
Served in a snifter, this one is black as coffee with a finger of head about the color of the label, a fitting foreshadowing of the name and the taste.  A fine net of lacing stays at the top of the glass.  The smell is coffee, tobacco, vanilla.  Taste is consistent, but the molasses is fairly prominent along with that almost smoked woody flavor that you taste in a good BBQ brisket.  As the name suggests, the flavors run deep and complex with something new to find with every sip.  I am not detecting the red wine so much, but that may be flushed out with the suggested aging.
If this one gets better after 11/10/15, I need to return to the store where I found it and stock up.  $16 now sounds cheap.  Again, will update this in November (with much anxiety in the meanwhile) to see if one of the best I've ever had actually improves. 1,236 charactersMichialTanner1, Apr 26, 2015

Served in a snifter, the beer pours dark brown/black with about an inch frothy tan head that stayed around for a while.  There's also a bunch of lacing.  Aroma is great, the brew smells like molasses, red wine, oak, coffee, chocolate, burnt/charred malt, and a bit of vanilla.  The taste is pretty good too, there's burnt/charred malt, coffee, chocolate, molasses, licorice, red wine, oak, bourbon, and vanilla flavors.  Lots of bittersweet goodness!  Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's coating and creamy with moderate carbonation.  I've been waiting a while to try this, and I wasn't disappointed!  I liked this brew a lot, it's going to be hard for me not to drink my other bottle before the "best after" date.  I'll definitely buy this again the next time it's released.  $14.99 a bomber. 857 charactersbluejacket74, Apr 25, 2015

A stout with an “old ale” edge. This beer is the perfect example of how a good beer can taste terrible when it is served too cold. Let this baby warm up to fully appreciate its depth and complexity. This beer brings back faint memories of dark chocolate covered cherries with too much bourbon.  4.5
A – Pours black with red highlights and a two-finger frothy reddish brown head. Head dissipates a bit too quick (-). Not viscous. Great lacing with prominent alcohol legs. 4.5
S – Roasted malts, faint fruitiness and sweetness that almost made me think the beer was infected before I had a taste. Hint of dark chocolate and vanilla. 4.0
T – Deeply roasted malts, an obvious lack of sweetness, a late bitterness that creeps up on you at the back of your mouth and in the throat that includes a very oaky finish. I can taste and even feel the alcohol. 4.5
MF – Medium-heavy body with a dry alcoholic finish.  Smooth, even a bit creamy. 4.75 1,105 charactersSludgeman, Apr 25, 2015

T:  burnt coffee, very bitter dark chocolate, bourbon sweetness for a brief moment before moving into a strong milk chocolate carries through to light tart fruit before finish, dry charred oak finish, a slight salty licorice throughout too, 
M:  medium-full bodied, satisfyingly coating, low-medium carbonation, feels thin to me, slightly ashy finish

5/5  rDev +11.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Opened a 2015 last night, felt I should use my Deschutes teku. 
Look: Dark as the night, thick as used motor oil. The head is a wonderful dark chocolate brown, like when you'd make ovaltine, but put WAY more than the container suggests. 
Smell: Dark, roasty malts, a bit of tang from the wine barrels, and a bitterness from the huge amount of dark malts present. 
Taste: Oh man, just how I like it. Dark, heavy, a little bit of bourbon, and then the wine barrel comes through. 
Feel: Perfect viscosity, oily and smooth, but the wine barrel keeps it from becoming too heavy. 
Overall: I obviously love this beer. It's quite good, and pretty easy to find. If you like beers with so much dark malts that it borders on bitter, you'll love this. Oh, and for some of the reviewers who said stuff like, "I can't taste the cherry bark!" well, I sure as hell don't know what cherry bark tastes like, and I'm even more sure that you don't either. 941 charactersivegot3Dvision, Apr 15, 2015

A: Pitch black. Small amount of light at the edges. Half a finger of brown head. No alcohol legs seen.
S: Coffee, chocolate, toasted coconuts, vanilla, pipe tobacco, spicy rye, faint bourbon. Some red wine shines through after taking a couple whiffs. Awesome smelling beer.
T: Bold chocolate and coffee upfront. Bourbon in the aftertaste. A lot of the stuff in the nose comes through as well, a lot more subtle. Combines very nicely for a very enjoyable taste.
M: Coats the mouth. Big mouthfeel and low to medium carbonation. Very rich beer. Goes down extremely smooth.
O: This was fresh, I can only imagine it'd get much better with age. Excellent example of a barrel aged stout. 761 characterschrisjws, Apr 12, 2015

A: Rich, slightly viscous black with a billowing, frothy mocha head. Looks fantastic
S: Definitely a wine-forward nose: lots of red wine, oak, and wood shavings. Also some cocoa powder and a thick bitterness.
T: Dominated by bitter dark chocolate, red wine, charred oak, and a touch of bitter coffee. No bourbon character, which is not a surprise given the blend described on the label. Reminds me of Wineification, but with a bigger body, more bitterness, and more wood. Definitely on the woodier and heavily charred side.
M: Thick and creamy, with an extremely dry and quite bitter finish. Really enjoyed the contrast between the smooth mouthfeel and the very charry/bitter flavor profile.
O: This is an exceptionally well-done beer that I really appreciated, but still one that I didn't enjoy that much. I loved the way the pinot shines on the nose and is present in the flavor profile, but this beer is a bit woody and too charred for my preferences re. stouts. Nevertheless, I'd recommend that people pay attention to the best-after date: I had a bottle of this right after the 2013 came out, and it was just way too bitter too even drink. But the beer's improved a lot since then, and I can see this getting even better in another year. 1,335 charactersblankenhoney, Apr 08, 2015

4.43/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I took this review January 2015 with the 2014 vintage. 
22 oz brown bottle with a simple yet point taken label and artwork. Label color is fantastic with black wax coating the neck and cap. The artwork is Deschutes' abyss spreading the entire label. Poured into a stemmed tulip glass. 
A - just like looking into the abyss. Rich black with the slightest hint of dark brown to black ruby corners. Chocolate colored head poured with size and settled into a ring of rich sticky lace.
S - a whiff of black coffee and rich tobacco up front. More like a whiff of a Cuban cigar type and sweet pipe tobacco. Vanilla sweetness from the bourbon barrel and an Oaked character in general. Cherry bark and pinot noir barrels give it a slight but welcomed fruitiness. Whiffs of chocolate, licorice, black strap molasses, and roasted malt make for one exceptional aroma.
T - wow.. talk about complex. Bourbon sweetness with vanilla bean and caramel. Black licorice, sticky sweet molasses, and an oakiness. Even the cherry bark and pinot noir barrel notes blend perfectly together and give a slight tart fruitiness to its big tobacco oaked backbone. Hints of black coffee and bittersweet chocolate add even more depth as this flavor warms bringing out more sweet bourbon vanilla notes.
M - full bodied and big. Complex from nose to mouth. Thick sticky texture coats every inch like drinking a meal. It's flavor and booziness blend together well as this warms. Thickness is spot on for the big flavor monster it is. Superb.
O - the 2014 Abyss has been the best one I've had. It is exceptional right out of the bottle and for me needs no aging at all. So many flavors and an aroma to die for. I'd love to find another bottle of this. Deschutes Abyss is a legend and the 2014 is the best they've ever created. An instant classic from a bottling that was already top shelf. 1,859 charactersBradtheGreat7, Apr 06, 2015

A: Brilliant pitch black, very thin head, tan foam cap, lacy. 
S: Faint roast, cocoa, vanilla, molasses, some sherry, some faint bourbon, very complex and layered nose.
T: Starts with a big dose of roast, espresso, cocoa, and an initial malty sweetness that dries out buy the finish. Sherry and bourbon notes are bigger in aged versions. 
M: Chewy, medium low carbonation and rich and dry. 
O: When it is available, buy it. A big ballsy beer well suited for winter evenings before the fire. 608 characterspat61, Apr 02, 2015

Had a shitty day, and stopped by a gas station of all places and found this, sitting there among bottles of malt liquor and trash. I have no idea why, but the price was $4. It looked good and I didn't know what it was so I thought it was some kind of gimmick. Malt liquor that is packaged like the good stuff. It was literally in the middle of the malt liquor rack. I bought one and spent the next 3 weekends buying 2 for each day, savoring the living shit out of this amazing beer. How is this $4? How? This weekend, the gas station was out, so I headed to a couple places and actually looked this up. Oh, limited time batch... find it at another place EIGHTEEN DOLLARS. I saved about $84 because of that gas station. No idea what the owner was thinking, but I sure as hell appreciate it. 905 charactersVladimir_Lootin, Mar 29, 2015

Smell - a blend of chocolate, bourbon, dark fruit and fudge.
Taste - the nose is more powerful, but the taste follows brilliantly!
Feel- bold and robust; smooth and easy to sip!
Overall - lives up to the hype; about as good of an imperial stout as you'll find! 336 charactersDenverHopHead, Mar 20, 2015

Feel: Somewhat flat, a bit light for a BA beer
Overall: Being a big fan of BA beers I felt this beer was one of my top 5 BA beers. Only negative is the light mouth feel.  I like a more thicker feel for BA beers. 303 charactersJonnyBoyy, Mar 04, 2015

No discernible chocolate or coffee notes, lack of both malt sweetness and hop bitterness. Barrell aged? Other than mouthfeel to some extent, you would never know. No oak, no vanilla present at all. Burnt cherry wood is bursting and dominates the profile, leaving little to no room for anything other than molasses which creates a strange but not all unpleasant BBQ sauce. At the price of this beer, I wanted more than what maybe an amazing marinade for lamb or beef. 559 charactersbismarksays, Mar 02, 2015

4.72/5  rDev +5.4%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.7522 oz bottle, poured into a snifter at approximately 45 degrees F.
Appearance: Pours pitch black like its namesake, and forms a fairly thick head of brown froth. Lacing is quite present.
Smell: The aroma primarily reminds me of red wine and dark chocolate, mingled together. There is a tart red grape and cherry presence, and I'd say around 80% - 85% cocoa dark chocolate.
Taste: At the opening, this beer follows the nose, a blast of pure slightly sour red wine with cherries and baker's chocolate. As it moves along, the flavors flow into a dark yeasty bread mingled with scorched toffee, with notes of vanilla along the edges. By the finish, the flavor profile is entirely black bread, earth, and oak. As the beer warms, the flavor transitions smooth out. The barrel notes, while present, do not overtake the entire beer, and the ABV lends just a pleasant touch of warmth. 
Mouthfeel: Full and fairly creamy, though a bit thinner than one would expect for a stout this black.
Overall: Quite a good stout, showcasing both complexity and intensity of flavor. I'm glad I happened upon a bottle of it sitting on the shelf at a local shop as I breezed in for some birthday shopping. 1,185 charactersUrbanCaveman, Feb 23, 2015

2014 version. Pours black, getting a lot of molasses and roasts in the aroma, not much barrel at all. Same thing in the flavor. It's a good beer but for the price it really needs to have the bourbon barrel more assertive. I don't know maybe a year of age changes this thing totally. Still a great imperial stout but I do feel I have to knock it down a bit for being at least a portion barrel aged but not giving me any in the flavor or aroma. 472 charactersPaulyB83, Feb 23, 2015
4.57/5  rDev +2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.7522oz bottle shared during #bottlecherwednesday at Beachwood BBQ in Seal Beach. Poured into a tulip. This beer is black, black, black - opaque and unyielding. A two-finger brown head forms before collapsing to a film and leaves patches of lace in the process. More lace rings are deposited on the glass during the session. The aroma is as advertised, but deliciously so - roasted malt, unsweetened chocolate, molasses, oak, anise, coffee, and barrel notes of vanilla and bourbon. Taste opens up with roasted malt sweetness, molasses, coffee, anise, and vanilla. Some bitterness creeps through on the finish featuring oak, coffee grounds, a little citrus hop bite, keeping the surge of sweetness from washing out everything else. Only trace alcohol flavors come through, surprisingly. Quite full bodied, thick, creamy, silky slick texture, soft carbonation, drying and warming on the finish. Delicious. 900 charactersSierraFlight, Feb 23, 2015

Pours jet black with a big tan frothy head that retains nicely. Smell has a slightly woody aroma with loads of charred malt, licorice, and hints of Star anise, cocoa and coffee. Taste follows the nose with loads of charred malt forward with a somewhat harsh bitterness intensified by a dry oaky almost tannic mid section. More oak, hints of vanilla, coaco, coffee and a dominating inteste bitterness in the finish. Medium to heavy mouthfeel with moderate carbonation and a dry bitter finish. Nice complexity but it could definitely use some time to balance out. 567 charactersFcolle2, Feb 22, 2015

Pours black with basically no light getting through; fluffy khaki head that leaves great retention and decent lacing. The aromas are chocolate forward with hints of oak. Tons of cherry and dark fruits. The wine barrels are present. The bourbon barrels, not so much. The flavors seem pretty complex and have alot going on. Lots of milk chocolate with subtle hints of vanilla. More cherry. There's a very subtle tartness going on. Very earthy. Tons of wood/oak characteristics. Tons of molasses. It's on the sweeter side, but it's not cloying. There's hints of dark chocolate and black coffee that gives this one a subtle bitterness that cuts down on some of the sweetness. It finishes with lots of BBQ smoke, probably coming from the cherry bark. Mouthfeel is nice. It's full-bodied with moderate carbonation. Very smooth and fluffy. Alcohol basically goes unnoticed. It's not hot or boozy. Dangerously drinkable.
This is a nice stout. I like it, but I'm not blown away by it. I am blown away by how smooth this is at 11% though. It's a complex brew. I feel the oak wine barrels dominate. The bourbon is subtle. 1,125 charactersBB1313, Feb 11, 2015

Should have aged it at least a year, but was eager to try it as it was my first time getting ahold of it. Fantastic beer, but could have used the aging. Very toasty and malty.

A: A rich, foamy, truffle brown finger of head; dark as night with thick, even lacing as the foam subsides. 
S: Dark chocolate, caramelized sugar, roasted coffee, and sharp, medicinal licorice. 
T: Roasted malt, cocoa, licorice, and hints of oak. This is not cloying: simple, straightforward, and effective. Some vanilla hints from the bourbon barrels come through, too. 
M: Thick yet strangely smooth, this might have some of the best feel of any Imperial BBA stout I've had. Slight carbonation rounds out the dark esters. 
O: While not bombastic, I don't believe that is what Deschutes attempted: instead, this extremely quaffable beer has no pretensions and is a simply elegant example of the style. This would win over someone who doesn't prefer Imperials. 779 charactersRanz, Feb 03, 2015

Poured a deep dark ebony body with a thin beige head.
Molasses, licorice, and a lot of oak and a trace of bourbon on the nose.
Smooth taste with that licorice and molasses following through with the oak you pick up on the aroma.  Didn't really pick up on a lot of the bourbon. 
Definitely a sipper. It coats the tongue with that molasses-licorice flavor.
Big beer!  Perfect closer or just a great choice for a cold day sipper. 463 charactersjhartley, Feb 01, 2015

I figure each one of my reviews takes about ten minutes, give or take. That's 3000 minutes reviewing beers on this website. That's 50 hours, a decent workweek for most people. I'd probably add in another 50 hours posting, looking at posts, etc., plus countless more spent drinking beer and reading my print subscription of BeerAdvocate. Needless to say, I have spent a lot of time and effort on all this. 
Side poured from the pint bottle, 2014 edition, into a pint glass with standard vigor. 
Appearance - As black as the Marianas Trench, just like I expected it to be. Nice two finger mocha head that dissolves rapidly but leaves intensive lacing on the glass. Big dominating presence. Love the packaging, simple but gets the point across.
Smell - The smells mentioned on the side of the bottle can all be detected: bourbon, oak, dark fruits, booze, and a huge dose of chocolate. There is also intermixed some vanilla and molasses.
Taste - Even better than the nose. Massively complex. All of the scents of the nose are present on the palate. The dark fruits, vanilla, chocolate, and spices all make their appearances. Amazing!
Mouthfeel - Finishes smooth, big, rich, and with a touch of booze warmth. Goes down real easy, much better than an 11% ABV would suggest. Low carbonation, big body.
Overall - This is an excellent beer, fully deserving of the 4.5 rAvg and the 100 rating from the BA community. I don't have to explain a lot. Just go get the beer and drink it. 1,524 charactersTheCondor, Jan 31, 2015

Now, I am drinking a 2014 made last November, so I can't fully assess what this beer is supposed to taste like in a year and so on. But it is still extremely good and more than pleasant to drink. I'm not getting much smell on the nose yet, but the taste is phenomenal, after just 3 short months. Tastes as it should as described on the label (molasses, chocolate,bit of licorice, some vanilla) and it's awesome. An unbelievable clean finish, with literally no aftertaste but a kiss of Bittersweet chocolate cookies. I just can't wait for how this one tastes in another year or more 610 charactersbman13, Jan 29, 2015

Bomber pours into a tulip a dark almost jet black with just the slightest mahogony highlights when held to the light. A small but resilient finger of creamy khaki head that finally settles into a thin crown but leaves thick streaks of lacing throughout the glass.
Massively complex nose. Thick roasted malts of dark chocolate along with a bit of molasses. Dark fruit and anise. Raisins and wood flavors; bourbon, vanilla, and oak. Age has been kind to this beer and the flavors blend extremely well. 
Flavor follows the nose. Chocolate turns more to a sweet cocoa than the bitter dark chocolate flavor in the aroma. A bit of molasses and toasted sugar. Slightly bitter roasted coffee. Raisin, anise, and slight booziness from the bourbon. The virgin barrels aren't overpowering but definitely noticeable. Lightly tart anise flavor. Raisins and just a tiny hint of cinnamon spice and vanilla sweetness. 
Heavy body and moderately carbonated. Thick but soft, creamy, and velvety mouthfeel. No astringency and moderate alcohol warmth.
This is one of my favorite beers, and 2010 was one of my favorite years. This was the last release that wasn't aged in wine barrels and as of now (just a hair over four years on) it is drinking amazingly well. 1,285 charactersPhocion, Jan 22, 2015

4.98/5  rDev +11.2%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5I had it fresh. It blew my mind. If it had a thicker, more milkshake-y mouthfeel, it would be the greatest beer I've ever had. It was in no way lacking in heft. It was superbly smooth and quite thick and complex on many levels. The barrel-aging was so perfectly done, I can't even imagine this improving in 10 months. I was hesitant to try this for all of the negative reviews, especially the negatives regarding freshness. Don't wait. Drink up, me hearties, this beer is astonishingly good.
To get more in depth - there is a ton of ashy malt flavor in there, but the various barrels, even the 6% bourbon barrels, play their own parts in influencing the overall flavor. The cherry and the red wine are the stars here, putting their own spin on the semi-sweet chocolate notes of the exceptionally dark malt backbone, but the bourbon is still detectable, and for someone who has grown a bit weary of bourbon barrel beers, not only is the bourbon character perfect, but it is still there while being, wonderfully, a background nuance to the other amazing qualities in this beer. I actually can't perceive any flavor additions from the licorice or molasses or vanilla, but honestly that's fine with me. Vanilla can get a little played out in stouts, and licorice is not really my thing. Molasses can have the tendency to dry out a brew more than flavor it, and maybe it's simply cutting into the sweetness overall, which is fine. Having some subtle cherry and wine notes in a super-rich, dark-chocolate, ashy malt menagerie is plenty complex for my palate, and holy crap was this a treat. As close to a perfect beer as I've ever experienced. Just off-the-charts wonderful. The only beer I've had that could hold a candle to this is Founders Imperial Stout, and soon we'll see which I actually prefer. 1,797 charactersBradenMK, Jan 21, 2015

4.84/5  rDev +8%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Poured from a growler that I purchased an hour before drinking. 
Aggressive pour into a glass made for imperial stouts.
About 3 inches of a mocha head that left a nice trail of lacing.
Color was very dark like a black coffee, head was a mocha color.
Looked delicious
Smell.  Wow when I opened the growler was overwhelmed with the smell leaving bottle.
As I poured seemed to be overwhelming booze scent.  Was afraid would not like.
As it warmed up really smelled cherries and chocolate, and I swear every once awhile I got a vanilla scent.
Taste. Thought I would just drink a glass ended up drinking 3 its that good.  Did not notice any alcohol at all.  A nice coffee taste with lots of cherry.  First sip warmed my gut (I was drinking outside next to a fire and was cold).   Could not help but think this is a great night cap beer or if I was camping the first beer of the morning. 
This was a great beer and I am so happy to have drank it.
I normally don't drink a lot of Imperial Stouts but will be back tomorrow to refill the growler.  
If anyone on BA can recommend a beer in this style that they like more than this please let me know as I would love to try it. 1,166 characterswarrendietrich2001, Jan 17, 2015

You can save yourself some time and have a better experience by pouring a shot of bourbon and a splash of ouzo into a bottle of Dr. Pepper. If you want the authentic experience, stir in a spoonful of ash. That's probably harsh, but I found this brutally burnt/bitter tasting, messy, and thin. 414 charactersneurobot01, Jan 14, 2015

Appearance - This beer lives up to its name in the appearance department: black as the infinite void. A .5" dark tan head forms, then recedes slowly into a wispy, thick cap that leaves dark, sticky lacing.
Smell - Chocolate covered cherries come to mind immediately. Earthy, woodsy barrel notes creep in with estery, fruity spiciness.
Taste - Like the nose, semi-sweet chocolate cherry is front and center, then begins to bow out to earthy, woodsy, spicy, fruity, boozy barrel notes. Extremely complex. Roasted coffee and spice-bread-like malts come into play with suggestions of burnt-sugar and a musty yeast ghost note. Big alcohol is ridiculously well hidden; this beer isn't hot at all. A light touch of earthy/grassy hops becomes apparent, and the finish dries out very fast with charred barrel, fruity roasted malts, and light drying bitterness coating the mouth.
Feel - Carbonation is so light and gentle, but pervasive enough to carry this monster beer around the mouth beautifully. Full bodied and thick, but the carbonation makes this one extremely smooth, creamy, and absolutely sublime.
Overall - This beer is an absolute masterpiece; tastes like a barrel-aged chocolate covered cherry followed by about 20 other complex flavor notes, but dries out perfectly for a near-crisp finish. Obviously a lot of work, planning, and master-craftsmanship went into producing this beer - you can taste it in every sip. 1,452 charactersRedneckwine, Jan 13, 2015

Tarry, charred taste is endless. Mouthfeel is like a serious liqueur. Plenty sweet, but after a few hesitant sips, the bitterness is more dominant. Roasted malt and burnt sugar no doubt, but it's mostly charcoal. Sourish barrel tang with a brief malty sweetness, then-- oh, I get it-- the Abyss.
I don't get the attraction with something so nearly undrinkable, even though the flavors are quite intriguing until the bitter medicinal quality catches up. From the 22 oz bottle (2014 vintage) purchased at Liticker's Liquor in San Diego. The price was eye-watering but I felt obliged to try it, but once will be enough. 832 charactersmactrail, Jan 10, 2015

4.77/5  rDev +6.5%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.752013 vintage shared with me by my friends on my daughter's birthday.  Poured into Fiddlehead teku glasses.  Pours a typical stout-black with less than a finger of cappuccino-brown head that persists and leaves some tracing.  The smell is totally unique, combining licorice and black cherry with dark roasted malt and red wine.   The taste is similar to the aroma, but with additional layers of complexity - dark roasty malt, black cherry, big-chewy red wine, licorice, molasses - an incredible array of complimentary flavors.  The mouth feel is just about perfect - thick and oily, but not as thick and sweet as some of the big stouts out there, adequate carbonation - definitely a sipper, but not cloying.  Overall, this is a wonderfully complex stout, almost on par with a fine wine. 785 charactersFFreak, Jan 05, 2015

Pours jet black with a finger of thick caramel head.
Smells incredibly roasty with vanilla and bourbon notes preset as well.
Tastes so complex. Not totally barrell aged, not a straight imperial stout either, an entirely new creation with wine, oak, sweetness from cherry bark. Incredible bitterness in the aftertaste which paired perfectly with chocolate ice cream.
This is one of the most unique and complex stouts Ive ever had. 485 charactersBoldRulerVT, Jan 04, 2015

If I'm really supposed to wait til then to drink it, then why are you selling it to me now?
The barrel aging of this beer, especially the bourbon part, is a waste when 72% of the bottle is fresh, non-barrel aged liquid.
Deschutes has some potential with this brew.  If they'd up the barrel aging, and actually sold it when it's quality was peaking, they might have something here.  Until then, they'll have to live with reviews such as this. 584 characterschrismattlin, Jan 02, 2015
3.92/5  rDev -12.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 3.75Serving: 22 oz. bomber poured into a Cigar City snifter. 2014 Reserve dated "Best After 11/10/15". Most likely about 2 months old at this point.
A: Pitch black, no light getting through. 1/4-finger light brown head. Looks real nice in the glass, much more appealing that the Black Butte Anniversary beers. 
S: First thing that jumps out is the wine character from the wine barrels. Imparts a nice fruity, tart aroma, very bright. Next up is likely the cherry bark, as I pick up a strong bitter cherry and ripe fruit aroma. Not much vanilla or molasses. Not much bourbon. 
T: So initially I served this a bit cold right out of the fridge and was getting a ton of bitterness, lots of dry, dark fruit, and lots of dry wine character. Aftertaste was very bitter and dry. No noticeable bourbon, oak or vanilla flavor. As the beer warmed, some complex layering came through. The cherry bitterness spread out, some vanilla and oak came through, and the beer started to balance out. Still very tart in the finish, and very, very dry and bitter for such a big BA stout.
M: Big, full, creamy. Very dry on the aftertaste. 
O: Interesting expectations for this one. Top 50 rated, but lately has been getting a bad rap for some reason. Either way, went in with an open mind. For me, this beer does not live up to the hype, like many have been saying. The strongest barrel character, I think, comes from the wine barrel, and I'm just not a fan. 6% of bourbon barrel aging is non-existant and just a waste. Barrel character needs to be more present and balanced. Didn't pick up much vanilla or licorice, and instead got all dark fruit and bitterness. Way too dry for me. I think I may have had this too fresh, and for once, Deschutes may be right in saying "Best After" one year. 
Recommendation: Given the notoriety of this beer, I think it's worth a shot for everyone at least once. Not exactly worth the price, though. Also, consider buying two with one to age, or just age a single bottle, especially if you don't like fresh, bitter imperial stouts. 2,044 charactersSparty1224, Jan 02, 2015

Smell of leaves, grass and fresh veggies with bourbon, oak and espresso.
Very well balanced flavor of dark roast coffee, baker's chocolate, black licorice, fresh herbs and garlic.  Subtle, maple and molasses sweetness. Just a touch of oak.  Spicy in the finish.
Full bodied and rich on the palate with solid carbonation and a dry finish.  
Overall, a very well crafted imperial stout. I would  say it's almost closer to a Russian imperial version with the assertive hop qualities. 586 charactersbnes09, Jan 01, 2015

4.74/5  rDev +5.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5A: A finger and a half of dense mocha tan head with great persistence poured from the bottle to the snifter glass. As the had slowly receded it left a trail of chaotic lacing and a layer on top of the beer that lasted for days. The beer, a midnight black color with ruby highlights on the edges when back-lit. Noticeable alcohol lacing when swirled.
S: Unique dark and slightly tart cherry notes are medium. Roasted coffee, milk chocolate, sweet caramel and fresh woody oak aromas are mild but noticeable and balanced. The tart cherry reminds me of a kriek weirdly. no alcohol detected in the nose nor hop aroma. 
T: Heavy roasted malt with dark chocolate, cocoa and coffee. the tart cherry flavor comes through moderately and very lambic like or wine like. vanilla, toasted caramel and oak flavors all blended nicley in the middle. Bitterness is mild and the sweetness is moderate. Fantastically complex.
M: Big chewy body with a creamy low carbonation level. All the dark malts give a slight chalky mouthfeel but it never becomes astringent. Slight tartness on the back of the tongue and only a slight bit of alcohol warming
O: Wow.. what a complex crazy beer. This has been on my list for a while now and now that Deschuttes is in WI I was able to grab it off the shelf with relatively zero effort. Awesome flavors with great mouthfeel. This really stood out over so many other hyped stouts. Unique and it lived up to the hype. 1,434 charactersguityler83, Dec 27, 2014

This fine imperial stout pours pitch black with a firm one inch brown head that dissipates to a thin layer with light lacing.  Nose of licorice, dark chocolate, molasses, oak, plums, some light smoke, and strong booze.  Flavors are excellent.  Waves of chocolate and rich coffee break against a solid backbone of brandy like richness.  This all mingles in the back with black licorice and molasses that warms with subtle bourbon flavors and some light bittering hops.  Balanced for such a beast.  Moderate carbonation makes for a smooth mouth feel while it is still a very coating brew. This one is towards the top of my stout list for 2014.  Awesome.

Appear dark black with a surprisingly nice 1 plus finger head. The head color is definitely dark white nearing a pleasant caramel color. 
Aroma is rather tame. I primarily get the oak. I get some malt sweetness. Perhaps it’s the licorice. 
Taste is rather on the dry side. I get a huge amount of oak. Tobacco flavors are definitely present. A good bit of carbonation is present. Very little alcohol presence. This beer is so well balanced. I get dark almost burnt espresso. While only a minor portion of the beer is aged in oak, I get this flavor primarily. Definitely on the dryer side. Coats the mouth beautifully. Excellent lacing. Some major hits of tobacco. 
Overall, this is just a wonderful sipping beer. While the beer is still rather fresh, I can only see it getting better with age. I don’t normally care for stouts and this is the second best stout I have tried to date (behind BCBS). As it warms it keeps getting more interesting! I could see this pairing well with some smoked meats, maybe a brisket. I could also see it with a dense chocolate cake or a tiramisu. I give it a 99/100.
***Addendum***
2015 abyss 
Aroma is absolutely gorgeous! Bourbon, brown sugar, a slight red wine tartness, molasses, coffee, chocolate, and oak. 
Taste is of roasted malts, tobacco, burnt coffee, oak, a bit of underlying bourbon sweetness and alcohol heat. Medium to thick mouthfeel. Medium carbonation. More of the red wine character comes out as it warms. Rather dry finish. 
2014 Abyss with 1 year of age. 
Red wine is much more dominant on the aroma, some caramel, oak, and a bit of bourbon. Little more dry smelling than the 15. 
Taste is much fruitier than expected, some citrus, oak, char, roasted malts, coffee, and coco powder. Same dry finish. 
The ’14 with a year is much fruitier than the ’15. The ’15 is a bit darker and more bourbon forward, especially in the aroma. I actually preferred the ’15 this year more than the ’14, but that may be because the bourbon barrel blend substantially increased between the ’14 and ’15. Overall, both are still world class! 2,113 charactersDaverCS, Dec 26, 2014

Aroma is roasty and boozy, with notes of dark chocolate and black cherry adding complexity.

A - As promised. Pitch black. Lovely dark tan, frothy head that leaves significant lacing, and a 1/4" ring.
S - Not a lot going on for what I expected, but nice. Noticeable red wine notes and roasted malt. A bit of molasses and espresso. Very faint alcohol/ bourbon. 
T - I honestly thought drain pour at first sip. After hanging with it for a minute, the flavors seem to grow on me a little. I think it is the initial blast of the wine barrel and licorice combo that really put me off, but they seem to start melding with the other flavors. This includes a lot of sweetness seemingly from molasses/brown sugar, and vanilla, sour cherry, coffee beans, some definite oak, and a touch of bourbon at the end. Finishes pretty bitter and tart.
F - Creamy texture. Medium carbonation. 
O - In all fairness, this beer probably shouldn't be reviewed until it's "best after date" like Mirror Mirror. That being said, Mirror drinks much better right out of the gate. This beer is pretty harsh, and all over the place flavor wise. I really think my score on taste will only be higher when I drink my next bottle a year from now. It cant really get worse I think. This is good, but hopefully it will reach the "world class" status that it has earned. Right now?… Nope. Not even close for me. 1,349 charactersWesMantooth, Dec 21, 2014

Very dark indeed. A bit flat, but also a bit of head, quite a conundrum. Bold, yet no sharp flavors at the same time. 
Definitely coffee-like, but broad in flavor all the way through. Smooth, but not creamy at all as it is so darn bold. Coffee meets malt. Solid stuff.
Not an absolute favorite of mine, but definitely zero complaints and very good and worth trying. 401 charactersMarcGetty, Dec 16, 2014

A:  Just like the name implies, this sucker is pitch black.  No light penetration at all.  Very dense 2-3 finger dark tan head that seems to last forever, and never completely diminishes. Plenty of sticky lacing left behind.
S:  Deep roasted malts, rich espresso beans, bitter dark chocolate, vanilla, molasses, and sweet bourbon.  There are some subtle charred oak notes here also.
T:  Again, lots of deep roasted flavors going on here.  Coffee, chocolate, molasses, and vanilla.  Reminds me of eating dark Swiss chocolate and sipping on strong espresso next to a roaring campfire.
M:  Full bodied but not heavy.  Fairly heavily carbonated for a big stout, and finish is a touch bitter and slightly dry.
O:  Excellent stout that hits on all of the notes that I enjoy. I look forward to cellaring my 2014 bottle for later. 886 charactersrichj1970, Dec 15, 2014

Nope, not better yet. Light aroma of chocolate, oak, dark fruits, but not as complex as I was expecting or as I'd been hearing of.
Okay, now maybe we're going somewhere, nice coffee, chocolate, vinous, oaky, and bourbon sweetness well balanced and a dry finish.
I was expecting thick, chewy, and sticky, what I got was thin, watery, and dry. Not good.
Overall, this one refused to live up to it's hype. 594 characterslarryarms847, Dec 14, 2014

4.2/5  rDev -6.3%Dark head, really dark beer. this beer actually had a decent head which is surprising for a high alcohol beer. The aroma was a smoky whiskey, with a slight hint of coffee. Lots of bitterness in this beer especially at the start this than transitions for a coffee/ chocolate flavor that is very light. It ends with a nice light vanilla whiskey flavor. Really enjoyed this beer the roasted notes really come out causing come of the initial bitterness. I feel like this beer had more bitterness than most barrel aged stouts of its kind. 533 charactersi4ourgot, Dec 14, 2014

What a wonderful beer. It pours like thick burnt motor oil and is capped by a deep mocha head.
The aroma is fantastic with scents of burnt malts, coffee caramel creams, molasses, dark stewed fruits and bourbon barrels.
The taste is equally up to par with a big roasty malt taste bourbon coffee molasses sweetness.
It drinks fat on the palate smooth and sweet.
Overall it is well balanced. I like the way all the flavor components balance each other and compliment each other. The only delta here is that there is maybe abit to much roasted burnt malt taste.
I love it I have two to cellar for next year. 645 charactersmicromaniac129, Dec 13, 2014

22oz 2014 bottlewith black wax. "Best After" date of 2015-11-10 (which I'm consciously violating). 074 D-1 1106 is printed on the bottom. Split between a pair of snifters. Fridge temp. Looking forward to it warming up.
Pours thick, viscous, black, with a small brown head that fades to a ring fairly quickly. Looks like an imperial stout.
Smell is surprisingly yeasty and bready. Wood, wine (and then I noticed that pinot noir barrels are mentioned). Slight sour cherry aroma. Surprisingly mild...but it's still coldish. A little swirling yields strong alcohol aroma. As it warms up, a much stronger woody aroma emerges.
Taste is chocolate, nearly burnt roast, strong cherry or plum, dry red wine, bitter finish. Coffee. Bourbon is surprisingly muted -- but I guess only 6% of the beer was aged in bourbon barrels. Something is surprisingly sweet -- combination of cherry and vanilla, I think.
Mouthfeel is surprisingly thin, extremely dry, a little chalky, but for some reason seems to go well with the beer. Overall, it's very good. I like it. I have two more bottles, and I look forward to having them with some cellar time. 1,142 characterssnaotheus, Dec 12, 2014

A: 4.75 Looks nice and thick on the pour. Pitch black with a two-inch tan head that lasts a few minutes.
S: 4.5 The aromas are very impressive. The description of what goes into the beer seemed a bit over the top, however, most of the characteristics seem present. There’s a good amount of roasted malt, coffee, and bittersweet chocolate at first followed by raspberry and vanilla. The berry aromas add a nice brightness that balances out the richer, darker elements. A very subtle earthiness is also present which goes nicely with the fairly mild oak.
T: 4.5 Similar to the nose, just a bit less subtle. The same roasty coffee and chocolate flavors come through first, but the subsequent berry flavors are much more dominant than on the nose. The wine barrels add at lot more than expected; there’s some bitterness which is probably coming primarily from the malt, but it seems like some is also coming from the wine as there is an almost tannic quality. Cinnamon and vanilla mix well with the molasses and the very light licorice flavor. The finish is fairly bitter, complimenting the fruity sweetness at the beginning.
M: 4.5 The mouthfeel is nearly perfect; very thick with a great carbonation level. The finish is a tiny bit too dry, but that’s an extremely minor detail.
O: 4.5 I’ve been wanting to try this beer for nearly four years now and was very excited to finally have the opportunity. I really didn’t know what to expect and was presently surprised. It is unlike any other barrel aged stout I’ve had; not at all similar to something like BCBS. Rather, the additives and, perhaps more importantly, the wine barrel a great fruitiness to counter the dark, rich beer. Glad to finally have this and was not let down. 1,755 charactersTele, Dec 06, 2014
3.88/5  rDev -13.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3 |  overall: 3.75In the glass, yea it's dark... living up to it's name. Aroma gives off licorice, coffee/espresso, molasses, wine and chocolate flavors. The actual taste really only follows through with the licorice, bitter chocolate and espresso-coffee booziness. There is a slight wine and cherry tartness coming through, which I'm not a huge fan of, but it's not overpowering. 
While tasty, the problem for me is that no single flavor really shines through. All the flavors got lost in The Abyss? The overall flavor profile seems somewhat unbalanced and a little bit messy. Several sips in, it gets a bit one-note with the roasty booziness. 
Many people have said this is great with a year or more on it, and it might be... but any truly great beer should get BETTER with age, but still be excellent fresh as well.  Very good, but not great... and overall, not worth the $17.99 per bomber price-tag. 
I think it would be amazing for Deschutes to do a 100% bourbon barrel-aged version, but they seem to be against 100% barrel aging for whatever reason.
*Edit... having a 2014 on 12/2/2016, two years later and the review from 2 years ago is still true. Didn't get any better with age and it just still taste like a non-barrel aged massively roasty stout with a somewhat acrid mouthfeel with very little barrel character. Although the 2015 vintage did taste a bit better even fresh. 1,370 charactersmig100, Dec 06, 2014

Heavy, thick, tasty. Just a couple terms for this beer out of thousands. The beer was dark, and by dark, I mean DARK. The beer itself was thick, heavy, and very smooth. As for the taste profile, the beer had intense chocolate notes. It reminded me of a dark bittersweet unsweetened brownie.

4.55/5  rDev +1.6%I tried the 2013 version, on draft.  And then I tried it again :)  This beer is really amazing.  Pours dark brown and opaque, with a thin, filmy dark brown head, lots of lace.  It has great complexity, with dark fruit, coffee, cocoa, anise, wood, whiskey, and leather notes.  But, it does not hit you over the head.  There is a subtlety to the flavors as they develop.  You notice the heavier flavors at first.  Then wait a bit and you notice some of the smooth, sweetness and even a hint of hops.  Thich, rich and winy, with low carbonation and a long finish.  Well-balanced.  This is a big beer, but also thoroughly drinkable.  I really have to get my hands on some of the prior years. 687 charactersPacNWDad, Dec 05, 2014

Ink jet black.  Luxurious brown mocha stubborn head.  
Roasted dark coffee and burnt oatmeal are prevalent on the nose and in the mouth but there is so much more going on behind the scenes.  Each and every sip is different.  This is huge and intriguing and nuanced to the very core. 
In my opinion this stout is absolutely, impeccably flawless, and is deservedly getting a 5.0 from me.  
This is so outstanding I almost don't want anybody to even speak to me while I drink it, so as to break the loving trance.  
Deschutes brewers, you deserve a very very slow quiet clap on this one, gradually building into a resounding, standing applause. 660 charactersGIVEMEBACKMYSON, Nov 28, 2014

5/5  rDev +11.6%Just picked up a case if the new release (Nov. 2014) here in Portland for $17.29 a 22oz bottle. WHAT?! Did you say $...-Whatever, freaking expensive beer. Anywho, we opened a bottle and my wife and I agree, its even better (and more expensive) than last year.  Richer and smoother and a softer finish.  Paired amazingly well with pizza.  
Again, not at all worth the price, approaching $12 a pint, but as my wife simply loves the stuff, I guess it actually is worth it.
Creamy chocolate espresso shot in every sip.  
Just be sure to have an appetite and a comfortable place to sit, to make the most of the experience. 620 charactersKurtandNathalie, Nov 27, 2014

I stumbled into it on draught, and this magical elixir changed me forever. I'll admit that I've had spottier results with bottles, some still excellent, others just good, but, and perhaps it's just my imagination, this brew has some way of going to another level on draught. It's rich without being heavy, and it's got big pops of flavor (cherrywood, dark chocolate, char) without going over the top. If you find a keg of this bad boy, go to town. 513 charactersbreadwinner, Nov 24, 2014

4.3/5  rDev -4%Serving: On tap at the Hay Merchant, in snifter (10 oz); 2013 release.
Appearance: Deep black with moderate cap of brown foam. Leaves nice lace as it goes.
Smell: Roasted malt and woods (both forest and barrel).
Taste: Dark roasted coffee beans with molasses sweetness emerging as it warms. Malt well balanced by intense herbal, bitter hops.
Mouthfeel: Medium body, not as viscous as expected. Moderate carbonation keeps intense flavors from being cloying.
Overall: A great sipper; definitely improves as it warms, starting almost as iced coffee with malt and alcohol emerging to round it out as it warms. 610 charactersHipCzech, Nov 19, 2014

A - sticky, viscous, light brown head is darker brown towards the top of the black colored ale
S - wine barrel stands out in the sweet, complex nose; chocolate, oak, vanilla, cherry, bourbon, booze are all very present as well
T - very sweet, very rich, very complex - better as it warms; dark chocolate, molasses, caramel, wine, cherry, vanilla, roasted barley, oak, bourbon
M - rich and full bodied, smooth, excellently balanced
O - not quite as good as I recall the 2009 release being, but this is a world class American Imperial Stout regardless. So much care and precision goes into this beer, and it pays in quality and complexity. 693 charactersbarnzy78, Nov 17, 2014

4.5/5  rDev +0.4%2009 Reserve poured from bottle into snifter. Aroma was black licorice, chocolate, vanilla, hazelnut, a little bit of booze and some dark fruits like pomegranate and plum. Color on this bad boy was a pitch black abyss with a a brown head that receded slowly. It was as expected a big, full bodied beer that was thick and creamy. On the palate I got a lot of the same stuff as the nose, the black licorice and chocolate were the big ones, but also those dark fruits, vanilla, and a little bourbon as it warmed. This is a phenomenal beer, but I personally don't think five years on it was really necessary, a couple would probably have sufficed, and I say that having had it aged to various degrees in the past. Regardless of my opinion on that this is still something to pick up and drink fresh, or experiment with aging to your liking. All in all I can't wait to have my next Abyss. 882 charactersBrewChatKen, Oct 29, 2014

A:  Nice.  Pours a relatively small head, but it lingers and leaves adequate lacing.  Beer is not perfectly black, however.  There's a noticeable reddish tint when held up to light.
S:  Very good, but more of a dark-fruit stout than a roasted-coffee/chocolate variety.  Some coffee gives way to dark fruit, plum and some vanilla.  Overall a very sweet blend, but nothing that I haven't gotten from other beers.
T:  Again, very good.  Taste follows the nose.  Some charred malt followed by a basket of dark fruit: plum, raisin, cherries and figs.  Also a very winey taste lingers at the back of the palate.  
F:  Good, but not as thick as it should be, IMHO.
O:  A very good stout.  However, I prefer the coffee/chocolate stouts over the dark-fruit varieties, so to me this beer is just "good." 875 charactersleantom, Oct 26, 2014

Both smell similar with the 2015 smelling a little more like the barrels it was aged in. My first taste was from the 2015 to see what the beer taste like fairly fresh. It was definitely more hot as you get a lot of booze in the flavor. 2014 the taste has smoothed out and you get a complex melding of flavors but the barrel is still present just adding to the overall taste. The feel of both is thick with full mouthfeel. The abyss is a beer that I look forward to every year. Barrel aged stouts don't get much better than this! 641 charactersMeyers1023, Oct 13, 2014

4.77/5  rDev +6.5%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75I recognize that the big (ie., ageable) great beers should be great fresh, and then potentially become even greater (or at least great in different ways) over time--until some inevitable point of decline years down the road.  The Abyss, I think, is an exception to this rule.  It is good fresh, even very good, but not great: an intricate combination of flavor that has not quite come together into a cohesive whole.  Give it time.  It needn't be a year (though maybe that or longer is best, if it's cellared properly), but at least a few months.  The stronger elements in this brew (maybe for your palate it's the wine barrels, or the cherry bark, or the roastiness, or...) could be too harsh right out of the gate; but eventually they will all soften and meld, and yield a sipping beer of exceptional subtlety and complexity.  Those who are pining for a 100% barrel aged version of this are, I think, maybe missing the point.  There are plenty of beers like that.  Deschutes's fractional approach to aging, and aging in a few different kinds of barrels, are precisely what make this beer so very special. 1,106 charactersNietzsches_Horse, Oct 06, 2014

Every BA Stout I try from here on out will be compared in my sub-conscious to this beer.
Cracked a '10 Abyss on October 2, 2014.
Pours a ridiculously thick black, no light getting through even when held up to a bulb.
The nose is stunning, flavor is immensely complex.
I've read that these peak at 5 years, after this tasting I can definitely vouch. 387 characterscommunionofthesaints, Oct 04, 2014

5/5  rDev +11.6%2007 vintage. Deep dark malty goodness. I bought a case of it in 2008 and cellared it since then.  Initially was overpoweringly strong almost off putting the medicinal alcohol over shadowing even the heavy malt flavors. Around 2010 it came into its own. Mellowed out and smoothed out the finish to silk. Sampled one or two every year after and it just gets better and better. Down side, there is only one left. Ok, I should have put down 2 cases. However there is still the 2009 and 2010. Will there be more? Oh please! A masterful brew. Will it return soon… Oh please!! 572 charactersgrat, Oct 01, 2014

4.47/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5A- Pours thick and syrupy as any beer that I have seen. Pure black in the glass with a one finger head. The head is thick and creamy in texture and chocolatey in color. Lacing is tremendous due to the thickness of the head.
S- Huge dark and burnt malts hit the nose right up front. Sweet and dark licorice and chocolate scents follow up the dark malts. Towards the end of the smell the licorice sweetness really ramps up and is the dominant lingering scent. 
T- Starts off with a bang of dark malts that are primarily burnt in flavor. The licorice is prominent behind the malts, providing a dark sweetness. Just a touch of barrel character is detectable underneath all of the aforementioned flavors. Just the slightest touch of red wine fruitiness is detectable before the malts take over again and give you the lingering flavor.
M- Thick and smooth as hell on the whole. Very low carbonation and an alcohol content that is largely hidden by the dark malts.
Overall a wonderfully dark and complex beer. Smooth and easy drinking as imperial stouts come, this one could really sneak up on you, but it is totally worth it. 1,123 charactersboilermakerbrew, Sep 28, 2014

4.25/5  rDev -5.1%Bomber received in trade with iguenard - 2012 edition - my 2000th beer!
Appearance - Dark brown colour with an above average size frothy beige head. I can't make out the amount of carbonation showing and there is some fair lacing. The head lasted for over 5 minutes before it was gone.
Smell - Malts, chocolate, coffee, dark fruits, wood, burnt notes
Taste & Mouth - There is a below amount of carbonation and I can taste malts, chocolate, and coffee. There is also a dark fruit flavour, and ashy burnt flavour, and a woodiness.  It ends with a charred aftertaste.
Overall - Not as sweet as I thought it would be.  The booze is very well hidden and thee beer has a complex taste with lots of nuances.  Lots of flavour and yet incredibly well balanced and easy to drink.   You can tell a lot of work/care went into this, and it is worth the price. 851 charactersspinrsx, Sep 18, 2014
4.2/5  rDev -6.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 42011 Abyss  sampled 8/14/12. God, it's been awhile since I've entered any reviews...
Deep creamy brown with a tight brown head with good retention. Rich chocolate aroma, roasted and dark fruit notes and slightly vinous alcohol. Molasses and raisins with a heavy roasted finish and alcohol linger with some light oak notes. Semi-dry but thick and a bit sticky and foamy. 
I couldn't wait very long for this one and I'm afraid I should have done so. It's a big strong stout with a little too much booze and a too little complexity. The rather hot nature of the beer is something I've noticed in Deschutes' big beers early on in their lifetime. Flavor is good but unclear and heavily balanced toward the roasted malts. I will have to age the next one for longer. Overall it was still a good compliment to Jackie Brown as it would be for The Abyss, of course. 857 charactersBriken, Sep 18, 2014

The competing barrels create a field of play on the palate that's nothing short of entrancing.

4.39/5  rDev -2%2013 vintage. Best after 08/16/14.
Pours opaque black. The 1/2 inch tan head fades to a thin cap on top and leaves faint spotty lace. 
The smell is of spent coffee grounds, dark chocolate, vanilla, faint dark fruit and a hint of alcohol. 
The taste is of bitter black coffee, dark chocolate, molasses, vanilla and faint black cherry. 
The texture is heavy bodied and syrupy with low carbonation. 
This is a very impressive coffee forward imperial stout. The taste improves as it approaches room temperature. 513 charactersFurlinator, Aug 22, 2014

The look is flawless. It's BLACK. The head is this sexy dark masterpiece and it refuses to go away. It's like the beer is wearing dark brown lingerie. The nose is perfect. Doesn't knock you out like some other Barrel Aged wonders - it's inviting, not intimidating. Taste is the same. There's a lot going on, but the brew invites you to look for the notes - like jazz - I'd compare it to KBS which is like a heavy metal song forcing those notes and melodies down your throat. This is smooth and mellow and fascinating. Listen to this one in an easy chair with the lights off. I particularly enjoy the mouthfeel, which is a testament to the quality of this beer. I normally have to think circles around myself to come up with something intelligent to say about the way a beer feels in my mouth. It's dry, with a gentle carb. So very smooth - I'm honestly having a hard time coming up with descriptors that aren't sexual - not because I want to try to be funny, but because its literally just that kind of sensuous sensation.

A: Jet black with a thin and wispy mocha head that recedes to a thin ring after half a minute. 
S: Big notes of raw cocoa, light roast coffee, and brandied cherries. Oak and vanilla each make themselves known mid palate. Very complex.
T: Chocolate covered cherries, macerated dark fruits, and slightly acrid/smoky malt flavors. Tannic vanilla represents the oak and bourbon barrel portions of the blend. A hint of dry red wine in the finish. Drier and less sweet than most BA stouts, which serves this particular beer very well. As with the nose, very complex.
M: Medium/full bodied and tannic. Palate coating texture causes the flavors to linger long after each taste.
O: An exercise in balanced complexity as opposed to the pure potency of flavors found in most stouts. Beautifully crafted. 810 charactersMore_betterness, Aug 07, 2014

4.59/5  rDev +2.5%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Enjoyed out of a 22 oz brown bomber with what appears to be a double-dipped layer of black wax around the neck and crown. I suppose a beer like this is worth the effort. This is the 2013 vintage, so I'm just a little over a week ahead of the "best after" date. Based on my experience, it was close enough to be excellent. Poured into an oversized 33 oz snifter.
Appearance - Pours an inky jet black liquid that reveals it's viscosity just by looking at the silky, almost melted chocolate way in which it pours. It builds a one finger head of mocha colored foam that doesn't stick around for long before transforming into a ringlet and just a wafting of film across the surface of the liquid. Lacing is all but nonexistent, but when I tip the glass, it reveals excellent legs from the almost syrupy liquid.
Smell - A rich, almost suffocatingly delicious aroma reveals a cacophony of characteristics, with strong notes of cacao and licorice as well as burnt molasses and rich, roasted malt. There is also a hint of sweeter notes from the barrel aging, with vanilla and subtle vinous red fruits reminiscent of pomegranate and red wine must weaving their way through the richer elements of the nose.
Taste - Picking up right where the aroma left off, there is a core of bittersweet chocolate and sweet vanilla initially that give way to char and roasted characteristics from the malt and black strap molasses. The licorice is just present enough to give this one some depth, but it doesn't come through in an obvious way, allowing itself to make it's presence known by how it enhances the other flavors, similar to the way the negative space in a painting works to accent the objects. The barrel-aging is extremely subtle, with faint notes of bourbon and wine must as well as some of that buttery oak characteristic you get from new barrels.
Mouthfeel - Full-bodied and rich, with moderate to low carbonation, allowing the liquid to coat the tongue similar to cough syrup, but in this case the taste and feeling is all wonderful, rather than unpleasant.
Overall, one of my favorite barrel-aged stouts around. The use of multiple types of barrels and the lower percentage of the overall blend allows the barrel characteristics to complement and accent rather than taking over the beer. And in this case, the additives work perfectly with the base stout and barrels to create a symphony of a beer--but this is no Mozart. While it's clear precision is at work here, the dark, overbearing stormy temperament to this beer is more akin to Mahler. 2,541 charactersLambicPentameter, Aug 05, 2014

Good retention, settling to a thin, persistent layer of suds. One swirl of the glass causes a nice lace to stick to the side, and it clings impressively.
Smell - The same classic Deschutes bitter chocolate and coffee aroma you'll find in their Black Butte and Obsidian, but also a bit of dark fruit, raspberry, vanilla, molasses and a hint of alcohol that one should expect with an Imperial. Moderate anise notes.
Taste - Again, the classic Deschutes bitter chocolate/coffee roasted malt makes it's presence known, then notes of vanilla and oak come into play. Complex and deep as hell. Dark and jammy fruit undertones. Molasses, hints of vanilla and anise creep in at various stages. Burnt malt and a bit of alcohol comes through toward the finish and into the aftertaste; not uncommon for the beer style.
Mouthfeel - Perfection. Thick and creamy, but goes down with impeccable smoothness. The smoothest imperial stout I've ever had. It disappeared from my glass far too quickly.
Overall - Wow! This is the best Imperial Stout I've ever had. It's near perfect. For a beer as big as it is, to have such smoothness going down is remarkable. My only gripe is that this beer isn't more widely available, because it is a champion amongst it's peers. Now my 5th go-around with this beer, and it sits easily in my top 5 beers of all-time. 1,423 charactersTheSixthRing, Jul 31, 2014

S: mostly molasses and caramel. smell was a let down compared to the taste...was totally expecting a dextrose bomb
T: a nice amount of coffee, chocolate and ending with a nice amount of roast. the bitterness of the finish really balances the brew out so it’s not overly sweet or cloying. 
M: chewy and perfectly carbonated. this was one of the highlights of the brew as it’s perfectly carbed and chewy.
O: I really enjoyed this. Barrel Aged beers had recently been letting me down. Too much cloying sweetness and not enough roast and bitter finish. This was a wonderful reminder of how delicious BA stouts can be. 751 charactersdsigmon, Jul 22, 2014

4.85/5  rDev +8.3%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Color-this is the pinnacle of what Imperial Stouts should look like. The only downsize to this beer in my opinion is the lack of head that stays with the beer over time. I enjoy the continuos tickle of head thru the drink.
The smell that first comes thru your nose is amazing. The strong hits of Vanilla and Chocolate is what takes you first. When you dig deeper into the smell you can get the cherry bark and then the slightest of Licorice. All this adds to the begging experience. 
With the first taste of the full tongue the head (if drank with it) fills the month and the flavor pop everywhere. The chocolate/vanilla hit every part to the initial swallow. The oak wood comes later thru the after taste and the overall flavor stays with you for a few minutes keeping the overall experience going. 802 charactersstallion_air21, Jul 21, 2014

A) Very dark, almost black. Glass is small, so 1 1/2 fingers of tan head forms and retains impressively, leaving thick lace and half-ring, half-cap.
S) I get malt, coffee, bourbon, sweet spices. It's really quite nice. 
T) Very malty, lots of coffee, some spice, some alcohol.
M) Balance not as good as I expected, though certainly not bad (could very well be my storage). A little bit of alcohol burn, mildly carbonated. 
O) It's definitely a solid achievement in brewing, but I'm a little less enthusiastic about it than some of the reviews I've seen. Maybe I should have let it go for longer. Unfortunately, I don't have another one. 
Without question, a great D/I Stout to share with friends or drink on a long weekend day. 813 charactersIvoryFoxhole, Jul 20, 2014

Jesus where to start... The appearance was pitch black, light caramel lacing didn't last long. Didn't need to. Smell was dark smoky malty molassesy bourbony goodness. There was a strange 'briney' smell that burned a little. Don't know how to explain it. Capers? Also some tartness, cranberries, cherries maybe. Taste was huge and complex. Cherries, dark chocolate, molasses, oak in the back. Insanely pleasant aftertaste that lingered forever. Mouthfeel is something I'm still not adept at critiquing, it was lightly carbonated and pleasant. This is the single best beer I've ever had. That may change in the future, but I'm happy to have gotten to experience such an expertly aged beer that was meant for such. 746 charactersCrossSideTop, Jul 11, 2014

The Abyss is a brew which has narrowly escaped me on a few past occasions, but thanks to the kindness of the good doktorzee, I now have in my possession the 2013 Reserve version - a frontal lobotomy, as it were. It's about a month until the ironically specified 'best after' date, but I think that they'll understand - my mother passed on early this morning, and so many things about this offering resonate in our shared world. This one's for her, full stop.
Into my Tamarack Brewing (such nice gentlemen!) shaker pint glass this falls, appearing nothing less than a veritable titular incarnation in its 'colour' (absolutely no light filters through this nightshade in June, awwww), with a slim handful of puffy, roiling, and creamy chocolate milk head, which leaves a solid paint job of Dofino Havarti cheese lace around the glass as it slowly backs down.
It smells of dark chocolate ensconced dehydrated cherries , bready caramel malt, salted toffee, dried black licorice, raw dark demerara sugar, woody vanilla, and herbal, leafy, and slightly grassy hops. The taste is big, richly sweet chocolate, edgy, vegetal, and almost smoked-seeming molasses, plain toasted oak, a hint of red wine lees, warmed Rice Krispie squares vanilla, a bit of wet ash, Nordic licorice, bing cherry bushes in bloom, an ethereal (the best kind) bourbon barrel essence, and somewhat bitter leafy, earthy, and dead grassy hops - the big alcohol is but a gentle touch, when you are bracing for a well-deserved smack upside the head.
The carbonation is actually fairly active, in a neat little frothy manner, the body medium-full in weight, the cocoa character smoothness firmly pushing the issue in the face of the gritty, muddled blend of woody, boozy, and hoppy neighbourhood kids. It finishes more off-dry than I had been anticipating - the aforementioned bitter players compelling the chocolate sweetness to unravel even further.
Well, the hype around the Abyss might be just that, hype, but that shouldn't detract from the fact that this is a heady, soul-steadying, and, um, 'complicated' Imperial Stout, one engendered by its outright drinkability (before the after, eh?), and further enabled by the expertly integrated, north of 10 points ABV. Like the special person of my heart and mind, this is strong, American, unapologetic, and duly faded to black. R.I.P., with much love. 2,397 charactersbiboergosum, Jul 07, 2014

2012 Vintage; poured 2014/06/22
A: Now that is a dark beer! Pours midnight, thick, opaque black with an impressive 2 fingers of everlasting mocha colored head that eventually settles to dense, creamy color leaving a curtain of lace in its wake. 
N: A massive nose on this beast! Massive malt nose, dark roasted malts, dark chocolate, boozy bourbon, vanilla, licorice and some alcohol.
T: The flavor here is so complex. Massive roast malt, espresso, dark chocolate, mild bourbon, vanilla, a touch of hot alcohol, leather, tobacco. The finish is loooong and actually dry out with a great hop bitterness to clean the palate.
M: There is a full body with nice carbonation resulting in a rich, silky-smooth, creamy beer.
O: This is such a tasty brew. All the various barrel treatments have added such depth and flavor making this a real treat. 915 charactersmtomlins, Jun 27, 2014

Initially had this in 2013 on tap at Binny's in Lincoln Park. Wasn't particularly impressed; granted, it was served cold and I didn't have time to let it warm as much as I typically like, but the beer itself didn't do much to standout as something so worthy of acclaim. I had been wanting to try it for a while, and was highly disappointed when it didn't rival BCBS to my taste. Good, solid, BA beer, but didn't do anything special for me.
However, I gave it a second try yesterday; a place nearby had 2012 on tap, and I figured, what better to do than give it a re-try when it's had a couple years to age? Good choice.
Served in a snifter, the beer is black, with a beautiful half-inch of brown head; looks great. 
The smell is complex, but I'm having trouble picking up what's going on (mostly because of previous expectation, I think). With that being said, I'm mostly concerned with taste, so let's see how it goes.
Taste: Huh. Still not as sweet as I'd like, but there IS something here! The bourbon barrel portion of this isn't blowing me away, but the pinot noir part is really nice, and gives the beer a distinctly berryish wine flavor. Very elegant, and interesting enough to drink in its own right. There's little to no heat from the barrels, and the beer is smooth throughout your mouth.
I'll admit, while this still didn't blow me away the second time, I get why people love it. Not my favorite if I'm going for a straight BA stout, but if I'm in the mood, I can see really enjoying this for the unique wine spit they've put on it. Nice job from Deschutes; glad I finally get it. 1,608 charactersSeanBond, Jun 26, 2014

Color - Black and opaque with a brown head, a very stout stout
Smell - all of them. They really crammed everything into this beer. Raisins, fruit, molasses, malt, a little coffee and chocolate, although the fruit came through more
Taste - again, everything but the kitchen sink. All the above smells, and maybe a little oak and carmel
Mouth feel - thick and syrup
Stout is not my preferred beer, but this one is pretty special 685 charactersJerryG, Jun 17, 2014

2013 Vintage
The usual, dark as night pour. Less than a finger of lazy cocoa powder colored foam that retreats and laces like a chocolate malt. It's a beauty to behold. Smells of baking chocolate, light whiskey barrel, prune, leather, brown sugar, dates, & diminutive wisps of vanilla. This is the best smelling Abyss I can remember. Warming....Ok now tasting. Well. no chocolate. Earthy roast, some leather, tobacco, oak. Kinda deep oak. Hmm, it's bringing some slight alcohol warmth in now. And a hint of red wine barrel...guessing in the range between cabarnet sauvignon and pinot noir, but just guessing. Finishes an earthy, peaty roasted leather meets licorice and burnt brown sugar, but eventually ends with tobacco.
Complex for sure. Letting them age definitely seems to smooth the edges. I'll be curious how the '09 and '12 I have will fare. If the flavor followed more of the into with the nose, I'd like this one a lot more. I find the complex palette of flavors to make for a fairly abstract painting that i don't appreciate as much as many folks. Not bad, but I'm toward meh. 1,257 characters2beerdogs, Jun 15, 2014

Deschutes Abyss 2012 Reserve
22oz waxed capped bottle with my Lost Abbey Teku glass
A: The Abyss is dark like motor oil and without any apparent translucence. Produces a steady two finger width of dark tan head that holds picture perfect in the Teku for some time. A few swaths of soft lace dot the glass on the way down. 
S: Smells of sweet chocolate covered cherries with loads of dark fruit character there and a healthy dose of roasted malts. The nose brings a light smokiness with it and some roast coffee elements but it’s not completely burnt or charred in any way. The molasses give off a touch of soy umami likeness and I get some of the pinot grape coming through along with a subtle oaky earthiness. Not particularly fragrant however it has some really nice and delicately complex aromas. 
T: Dark roasted malts meld with rich espresso notes and chocolate cherries followed by a mild red wine presence. I get lots of dark fruits with a soft smoky roast and just a touch of soy sauce there. Earthy hops produce sufficient bitterness for cutting through the sweet malt sugars and mixing in some spruce character. Layered in are the brewers licorice, brown sugar, vanilla cream, molasses, and soft woodsy barrel notes. Nothing is competing or contrasting in flavor. The beer finishes up rather dry for such a burly stout with some tannin like qualities and a nice alcohol spice influence in the finish. Rich and delectable with superior balance amongst all the complexities of flavor. 
M: The mouth feel is full bodied with a great creamy texture and ample bitterness that gives a much lighter occurrence on the palate. Touch of warming alcohol. Dry and lightly tannic in the finish. 
D: Revered by many and savored by all. This is a favorite Stout of mine whenever I am fortunate enough to acquire and 2012/13 was a pretty good year. Such great balance with layers and layers of flavor. Highly quaffable for such a beastly brew too. 
Have had this fresh as well which I may prefer...delivers more rich fudgy brownie with some heightened hop bitterness and most all other elements being the same. I would say now trying with some age on it the wine barrel notes do start to perk bit more.

4.75/5  rDev +6%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75The beer appears creamy pitch black. Khaki thick lacing around the edges. Dark brown head. 
The aroma is mainly sweet chocolate and dark fruit, with some leathery sort of note there. 
There are so many wonderful flavors: Chocolate, tobacco, whiskey, sweet raisins and plums, toast, and brown sugar. And all of these flavors play nicely with each other and make for an awesomely balanced and complex beer. 
On the palate, it's thick but not a monstrous mouth-full. Smooth and velvety. Easy to drink. There's a bit more carb than I thought there would be, but it's nice. 
This is one of the best stouts out there; and in terms of bourbon barrel -aged stouts, it surpasses many of the greats. Definitely worth the money, and I will definitely buy next year (as always!). 771 characterstitty_mcbitty, Jun 04, 2014

A- pitch black with a good size brown head. Disdipates quickly into a thin lace.
S- Tons of dark chocolate and roastiness. There's a candy presence also. It has a sweetness behind it and actually a little hop character.
T-a strong candied chocolate hits first. Then a sweetness that reminds me almost of berries. There's also a dryness attached to it that really represents dark chocolate and that sits on the back of your tongue. 
M- thick and viscous. Carbonation is subtle but you can definitely noticeable.
O- a very well crafted beer. The chocolate comes through so well but the dryness and the strsnge berry taste kind if yhrows me off a little bit. 699 charactersmlhyatt, May 27, 2014

A: pours a beautiful, jet black with an excellent fingers worth of thick, tan head which leaves good lacing and nice retention. A fair amount lingers around the edges and in the center of the glass.
S: roasted malts, vanilla, some oak, a bit of alcohol strength, nice dark chocolates.
T: up front lots of roasted malts, this is followed by, what I think is licorice? maybe the cherry bark? I get some vanilla from the wood, and some oak. lots of flavors in play here. Alcohol strength is hidden fairly well, though I feel its warming effects in my stomach. As the beer warms the licorice fades and the bourbon and wine barrel qualities start to show themselves, however, every so slightly. Do not taste much if any of the flavors of the barrel initially (only that oak and vanilla.) 
M: escellent, thick, creamy mouthfeel. very appropriately carbonated.
O: delicious. 953 charactersilikebeer03, May 25, 2014

I should of cellared it for a while longer, but I just couldn't do it. It had great flavor but I didn't get too much of the barrel aged flavor which might come out a little more with the aging. I did have the flavors of the molasses and a touch of the vanilla. Overall this is a beer to try, I hope I can get my hands on another to age for a while to see how it rounds out. 496 charactersjwerner23, May 24, 2014

Pours a deep, deep brown to black, completely opaque with a thick brown head. Lots of sticky lacing on the flight glass. A rich toasty, roasty aroma with lots of malt and dark fruit on the nose. The 2011 is almost perfect in taste so I'll give it that score. Toasted malt, with minimal hops, sweet with faint molasses on the tastebuds. The 2012 still needs a little more maturation to reach this point, but it's well on its way there. As for the mouthfeel, this is one chewy m-f- of a brew, a meal in itself. Full bodied is just the beginning.
Overall, this is what I want to sip on a chilly winter evening as I sit by the fire with my hunting malti-poo on my lap. 761 charactersmnredsoxfan69, May 06, 2014

Deschutes Brewery
Imperial Stout 
11% ABV 
APPEARANCE: As soon as I started to pour and it had that thick gurgle of blackness slowly coming out I new I was going to enjoy this beer. Very small mocha head that kinda danced around before it dissipated into nothingness. 
AROMA: Label pretty much describes the nose to a T. Molasses, slight licorice, dark fruits, chocolate and some nice oakiness. The nose is a little muted but still overall very nice. 
TASTE: Get that barrel right off the bat, oak, vanilla, the dark fruits cherry currants, some wine tannins swirling around as well. Chocolate it very prevalent, dark, light and coca. Not getting much of the licorice which I was looking forward too. As I drink more I get charred oak and coffee that really rounds it out nicely. 
MOUTHFEEL: Thick and syrupy, full bodied light carbonation. The alcohol heat gets you on the finish to let you know what you are drinking. This is so smooth and has a great overall mouthfeel. 
OVERALL: Truly great beer, layers really starting showing as it warms. The abyss has lived up to its hype. Delicious, highly recommend getting into this stout.

A: pours with a syrup viscosity with a brown head that dissapates quickly. Medium-heavy lacing.

T: the bitter chocolate and natural sweetness is balanced amazingly well. It is difficult to describe the sweetness but it brought a cherry/orange alcohol taste to my palate.
M: little carbonation. Left after the years but sits medium and very surprisingly light for the style.
O: th balance of bitter chocolate and alcohol sweetness makes this one of the top stouts. I personally would like a little more alcohol notes but an amazing beer! 636 charactersSavvyStudent, May 01, 2014

A - Pours a very dark brown with a single finger of brown head. The head dissipates slowly to a tan lacing.

T - Bite of hops/heavily toasted wood up front, a malty middle and a bitter aftertaste. 
M - Medium bodied with a moderate amount of carbonation. 
O - This beer did not bring its various components together in a harmonious fashion. While it smells good the taste is not focused. Fans of quirky beers (i.e. Blaecorn Unidragon) may like this. Otherwise, I would not recommend this. 635 characterskdahnke123, Apr 30, 2014

Pours a viscous dirty motor oil dark brown to black capped by a fluffy two finger dark tan head. Excellent retention with significant splotchy lacing. Complex nose; rich, dark chocolate, underlying roasted malt, toffee, charred oak, hints of red wine, dark fruit notes, just a faint touch of bourbon, and some pleasant booziness. The flavor is even more dense. Dark chocolate leads joined by plenty of dark fruit, most notably black cherries dominant, supported by raisins and prunes. Rich molasses with toffee join in along with caramel and dark chocolate notes. Oak and vanilla take the lead joined by some roastiness and anise. Finishes with some very light hints of red wine and warm booziness with a slight accent of bourbon. Big full body that means to be reckoned with. Moderate to low carbonation creamy, smooth, fairly velvety on the palate. The Abyss is truly a work of art and is among the top tier of both barrel-aged imperial stouts and blended barrel-aged brews. 1,100 characterschanokokoro, Apr 22, 2014

Pours dark black, with a one inch tan mocha head, and some lacing.
Smells include roasted malt, dark fruits, sherry, and espresso.
The taste is pretty similar. Can definitely taste this is a combo of wine and bourbon aging- some nice dark cherry flavors, plus lots of chocolate, espresso, vanilla, and oak. No real hop flavor, just luxurious malty and barrel-derived flavors.
Thick, syrupy, viscous mouthfeel. Low carbonation. Very drinkable considering the ABV, and very warming.
Another awesome BA stout, this is one of the all-time classics and tastes like it. 637 charactersGreesyFizeek, Apr 17, 2014

S- A lot going on. Dark fruits, sweet sugar, hints of sweet bourbon, charred oak, roasted malts, hints of coffee.
T- A lot of depth in the taste as well. Starts of seeming like a bourbon barrel imperial stout, but about half way through there are waves of coffee, chocolate, charred oak, then the wine barrel characteristics come in and present some red grapes and a slight hint of oaky funk on the finish. The molasses flavor rounds out everything, as it comes through in all of the waves of flavors.
M- Medium-high carbonation, thick and oily, but not as thick as I would have thought.
O- A great blended barrel-aged beer. Really complex, bold flavors, that hint of wine barrel is just fantastic and works well with the rest of the flavors. 914 charactersstephenjmoore, Apr 13, 2014

5/5  rDev +11.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Good luck improving the look of this beast. Pours like used engine oil. It's thick and syrupy. Extremely dark. The head forms slowly, a deep rich brown color. Good retention. A thin lace is all that remains.
You can smell just about each ingredient. Dark roasted notes. Char. Cherry bark. Licorice. Vanilla. Alcohol. It's all there. 
Same goes for the taste. Lots of woody tastes. Cherry. Vanilla. A bit of licorice. Expresso. Smoke. Alcohol.
As I poured, a few stops rolled slowly down the bottle. I slid my finger along to pick up the drops and licked my fingers dry...you could taste the manliness of this beer. But with a full sip, it's remarkably smooth for something so strong. Sweet and fruity up front, warm and bitter in the end. It's creamy til the finish. A bit of heat tempers the swallow. Very full bodied. Thick and chewy. 
It's an extraordinary beer. I wouldn't change a thing. I had the 2013 vintage and it said not to drink it until four months from now. I couldn't wait, I can't imagine it could be any better. 1,032 charactersRickS95, Apr 12, 2014

4.71/5  rDev +5.1%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75I have been wanting to try The Abyss for some time. I've been a fan of Deschutes Beer having many of their offerings on tap when visiting Portland but never The Abyss. Then when visiting San Francisco I came accross a great little bar called the Amsterdam Cafe that had in on tap. I couldn't believe it! I know that many times you build up your expectations for a beer and are usually let down. Not this time. The Abyss was amazing! The appearance was as dark as black ink with a thin foamy head. It smelled like coffee and chocolate and tasted like it smelled with a hint of vanilla. It had a couple more flavors that I couldn't quite recognize but it blended so well and tasted so great that I wasn't really paying close attention. The alcohol is extremely well hidden but definitely is felt when walking out of the bar. The mouthfeel is perfect with a thick, smooth feel that goes down easy. Overall, this was one of the best beers I've ever had and for the time being my number one beer drinking experience.
Edit on 7/29/16 - I've had many imperial stouts since my original review. I have to lower my scores on taste, feel and overall because I've had better. It's still an excellent beer, but as my palette develops and I broaden my scope of beers, this isn't the best. 1,275 charactersELS, Apr 11, 2014

A: Pours thick and black like motor oil...or the abyss. Very viscous. Super dark black...no light coming through with backlighting. 1/2 inch dark mocha head that fairly quickly recedes but still leaves a skim. Thin lacing also coats the glass.
S: Intoxicating aroma can be appreciated a few feet away. Black strap molasses, dark caramel malt, hint of sweet cherries, anise, and a bit of charred wood.
T: Smooth dark chocolate and cherries up front, followed by charred wood, black strap molasses, and a strong backbone of dark, roasted, and sweet malt. Wonderful transition across the palate. Anise and vanilla come through with warming.
M: Super silky smooth and creamy up front. This transitions to dry and bitter and finishes with the same. Excellent lingering and maturing on the palate...leaves a lasting footprint. Heavy feel.

A-A normal pour produces almost two fingers of dense, medium-dark-brown head. The retention is pretty good at roughly two minutes and the head leaves some nice lacing on the glass as it fades. The beer is appropriately named because this stuff if black as an abyss and still looking. 
S-The aroma is deep and full of dark chocolate and molasses with a nice roasted/lightly charred component. There is some vanilla and oak, and bitterness is lighter than many big stouts. There is also a little hit of tart cherry or sourness. A lot going here.
T-The taste, like the smell, is full of flavors. I get caramel and molasses, some dark chocolate, vanilla, a moderate bit of sweetness, some roasted/toasted malt, hints of tart cherry fruit, and a spicy, licorice/anise flavor on the finish. The beer says 11.1% ABV, but I don't taste it beneath all the other flavors.
M-The feel is medium in heft with some chewiness. The carbonation is mild, fine, and smooth. It is easy to drink for a beer this big and with this many flavors.
O-This is a hugely complex and well-crafted beer, but I'm not sure I enjoyed it as much as other big stouts. The Abyss definitely looks and feels the part with great appearance and mouthfeel, but I think some of the flavors here just did not click together on my palate. This feels a bit like experimentation to me and perhaps I just am not in the mood for the multitude of flavors tonight...anyway, high marks for complexity and structure, but only good marks for taste and smell. 1,590 charactersspoony, Mar 23, 2014

Appearance: a pitch black color. completely opaque. two finger tan head that fades slowly and leaves a good strong lacing. extremely viscous and leaves a slickness on the sides. a pretty spot on look for a big stout.
Smell: chocolate, roast, dark fruits. wood, slight smokiness. slight molasses. all these and more are there but its not the strongest and most profuse scent.
Taste: opens up with rich chocolate that mixes with a slight roastiness. lots of woody characteristics, mostly oak and some strong cherry wood are strong. ends with some licorice and slight molasses. also at the end a strong cherry wood and a very slight bourbon comes through. very strong alcohol comes and goes through.
Mouthfeel: extremely viscous and thick. strong alcohol kick and warmth. some bitterness from the roast and alcohol. 
Overall: This is a great and complex beer. lots of good flavors but fresh it is very rough. but if you enjoy beers that have harsher tastes, like me, than go for it young. shows great expectations for aging as suggested by the bottle. certainly lives up to its name and reputation. Only thing that is really lacking is the weakness of the smell 1,246 charactersSportsandJorts, Mar 09, 2014

I made no effort the attain it and I was able to get a half dozen bottles or so, which I guess meant it was never rare. Now it is available in the state I work and live. Guess I should post a review for it now. 
Dead black. A darker color is not possible. Floating onto of the abyss was a narrow tan head. The appearance was the model of the style. Textbook and perfection. 
The nose is assertive but not aggressive; more tantalizing then blunt. Rich notes of molasses and melt with coffee, chocolate, oak, vanilla and sweet, creamy chocolate. The aromas feel complete and not as choppy as say Yeti or Expedition. The barrel aging adds tremendous complexity and a gentle smoothness. A nearly perfect bouquet. 
Oh so… smooth. Insanely complex. A bite of licorice is matched with espresso, vanilla, chocolate and a bit of smoke and oak. Molasses-like sweetness is balanced with an underlying hoppiness. Malty from start to finish. It’s a full-on assault of creamy-roasty-black maltiness rounded from time in a barrel. A brilliant piece of brewing magic. As good as an RIS can get.
Full, rich, vinous mouthfeel; low (and perfect) carbonation. Ideal mouthfeel.
Big and bold and stupid drinkable. One of the best beers I’ve had. Worthy of the attention, worthy of the hype. Seek it out. Drink it. Share it. Enjoy it. 1,424 charactersbditty187, Mar 08, 2014

2013 Reserve.Pours a pitch black color with a 1/2 inch of dark brown head. Lots of lacing. The aroma is a great mix of oaky vanilla, cherry, caramel, coffee, dark chocolate and earth. The taste is more dark chocolate and coffee along with molasses and roasted malts. Nice notes of dark cherry, oak and vanilla throughout. Some boozey oak at the finish with more hints of cherry and earth as well a chocolate syrup. Velvety, slick mouthfeel with a moderate amount of carbonation. There is a lot going on with this beer. I would love to try one with some age on it but it's hard to imagine it any better than this. Overall, outstanding beer I'm glad I finally got to try. 716 charactersPicoPapa, Mar 06, 2014

A: Tiny bubbles in black ink. Tan head dissipates. "Tis a fine looking Russian lass.
S: Great toffee and maple syrup aromas. As it warms, the bourbon and oak come out a little more. LIght fennel/anise aroma underneath there.
T: There is a pleasant hop kick to this beer. Good bitterness, though not as bitter as Speedway or Founders Imperial. Definitely a bonus to have some good hop in a RIS. Hits that nice toffee/maple note from the smell and some chocolate too, but this is drier than you would expect. Very mild sweetness that is played off of the bitter hop aspect.
M: That fine carb really helps to coat the mouth. My mouth feels like I ate a bag of Werther's caramels without those pesky little clumps that get stuck between your teeth and gums. 
Overall: Find this beer and drink it. Duh. 992 characters3sheets2wind, Mar 02, 2014

Abyss is appropriate for the inky, black liquid that oozes into the glass like Quik. It bubbles up with a gorgeous tan head. The nose is a bit muted, but smells of cocoa powder. The mouthfeel is luscious, almost as thick and rich as chocolate milk. Cocoa dominates the palate, but there are also notes of oak and molasses. This is definitely a little less barrelly than some big BA stouts like BCBS and also a touch less boozy. Overall, a great beer. Seek it out. 501 charactersjjdc, Feb 22, 2014

Black as dick cheneys soul. Massive amount of frothy lacing, unlike dick cheneys soul. 
Smells like licorice and the woods. The dark mossy damp woods. But with a little bourbon and espresso too. A nice dark woods. Dick Cheney doesn't live there. 
Tastes like some sort of illegal drug. I've never used black tar heroin, but I would guess this is what it tastes like.   Burning. Boozy. More bourbon. More burning. Then you die. 
Feels like beer. 
You should not drink more than one glass of this at a time per the FDA. Buying a bomber is stupid unless you are having a get everyone really drunk party. 
I like bcbs more. 653 charactersdheacck11, Feb 21, 2014

Look: Dark, oily black.  Thin tan head that dissipates quickly.
Smell: Chocolate, licorice, cherry, charred oak, and vanilla.  A lot going on here.  Small amount of booze is present too. 
Taste: Tons of chocolate and vanilla up front.  The booze, charred oak, and cherry flavor come through on the back end.  Again, a ton of flavors going on - hard to detect everything.
Feel: Sticky, full-bodied.  No super hot for being freshly bottled - just enough bourbon bite.
Overall: One of my favorite stouts.  Drink this one warm, and the complexity will come out.  Wish I had another bottle to taste again.  Couldn't recommend anymore. 647 characterstmryan21, Feb 14, 2014

The aroma has a fudgey chocolate, almost a hint of smoked meat, a character that I would otherwise describe as earthy hops, but it could be that molasses and licorice in the beer. A dark fruit and woodiness throughout.
The beer hints in the front of smooth vanilla with dark plums and black cherry then onto a milk chocolate, then transitions aggressively to that black espresso bean. The beer explodes on the finish of complexities of that alcohol creeping up then tamed down by cedar wood, molasses, licorice, and then a drying quality of that oak.
A wonderfully complex beer with huge back palate flavor. I recommend this beer slightly cool instead of cellar temp. 769 charactersdar482, Feb 12, 2014
4.5/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5This 2011 bottle was drank alongside the 2012 and 2013 (shared with others) this past weekend; review is from notes taken during the tasting. The 2011 was my favorite of the three (and my review is thus of it), though the 2012 was the popular choice.
Pours black with a centimeter of caramel-colored head fueled by a constant stream of bubbles from the base of the snifter. The aroma is of bourbon, chocolate, molasses, vanilla, caramelized brown sugar, caramel, oak, and roasted malts. May pick up some anise if consciously looking for it, but it’s subtle if there at all. It tastes of bourbon, chocolate, rich/roasty malt, sugar, oat, oak, vanilla, raw molasses, licorice, and a hint of smoke. Mouthfeel is wet and viscous up front with a velvety finish that is warmed by the ethanol. Overall, this is a complex and delicious stout that does a great job of balancing and showcasing a wide variety of flavors and ingredients. 929 characterseclipse54, Feb 12, 2014

Both the aroma and flavor are amazingly complex yet balanced.. The complexity leads to different aspects of the brew coming forward in successive sniffs, with some featuring the wine barrel effects, another the BBL and yet another the dark roasted grains. Excellent sweet/bitter balance. 
O: Admired even more than I like it: It is created with a very complex brewing process, but all the pieces come together artfully. 454 characterschinchill, Feb 09, 2014

Deep, dark color in the glass. Virtually no immediate head, but nice tan collar and lots of tiny bubbles. Excellent, sticky lacing throughout. On the nose, lots of chocolate licorice and molasses, with hints of vanilla/coffee. On the palate, heavy roast and carbonation cut the intensity of the flavors, which replicate the nose, except that there is more smokiness to the taste than the nose would reveal. Ample, chewy mouthfeel.
All in all, very pleasant. But I must say that, based upon the hype, my expectations were disappointed. Honestly, to my taste, Parabola is twice as good as Abyss. 685 charactersJohnParadee, Feb 08, 2014

A- Pitch Black, dark tan bordering on light brown head. Can't wait to taste this.
S- Molasses, coffee, oak and bakers chocolate, mmm tasty.
T- The tastes on the smell are present and magnified with the addition of BIG molasses taste which dominates, with chocolate, dark cherries, coffee, faint black licorice and everything is oaked. 
M- Creamy and smooth, like a mixed drink with a cream base, absolutely outstanding. 
The finish on this beer has the slightest and sweetest of burns. I have hunted down the best beers that I can get my hands on (spent more of my income than I care to admit), and as far as stouts go this is second only to Dark Lord in terms of complexity and deliciousness. I can safely say that you can believe the hype and go for this beer, a complete joy to drink. Cheers! 860 charactersrazorsdescent, Feb 07, 2014

Today is the day, and I'm encouraged by the simple quote on the inside of the waxed cap: "Bravely done". You too, Mr. Beer, you too. Onward! Pours the most delightful thick and syrupy black I, one of the heaviest I have seen. Smell is not super in your face, but some lighter notes than typify stouts. I got lots of cherry, raisin, vanilla, bread and molasses. Taste is wonderful, loaded with toasted oats, sweet tobacco, coffee and some cherries and grapes at the end. Huge flavor from start to finish, leaving some roasted goodness to linger. There is a very slight hint of some tartness, and it works well especially with the slightly higher than average carbonation, for the style. Feel is heavy, and smooth. Coats your entire mouth. 
Overall, an absolutely incredible beer; it lived up to its hype 100% for me. Delicious, unique, full of flavor. Not much more I could ask for. 1,055 charactersSamuel906, Feb 07, 2014

A – Impenetrable darkness, the like of which was last seen when camping on a moonless night in the middle of a Pacific Northwestern forest. That’s very dark. Burnt toffee head which maintains perfectly ordered bubbles. The foam clings like foam-scum on a river but in an attractive way. Excellent retention.
S – A little muted. Mainly getting roasty toasty scents. Not very much coffee or chocolate.
T – Not as much hotness from the alcohol as I had anticipated which is a pleasant surprise. I expect age to add complexity to this beer; developing some sweet toffee or caramel notes to balance the bitter chocolate finish and burned, toasted malt-bread flavours. The vanilla, molasses, cherry bark and liquorice which are mentioned on the label don’t really make an appearance at this juncture. I do get some woodiness from the various oak-agings it undergoes, however. The booze arrives with scotch flavours mid-sip and fades to ash on the finish.
M – Already spot on. Thick, rich, hearty and satisfying. The thickness of the mouthfeel is visible even on the pour. This is a beer of significant substance.
O – I’m still pretty new to imperial stouts in general but this is certainly a very well-rounded beer. From memory it seems to be on an even keel with Narwhal, albeit with a richer body and less caramel or maple on the palate. I look forward to seeing how this beer ages. 1,522 charactersabeeronthebeach, Feb 05, 2014

Poured from a 32 oz. growler into a snifter.
The appearance is remarkable; a deep, dark brown, almost black. Very little head on this beer and it quickly dissipates to a light trail around the outside of the glass and a dusting on top of the beer.
The initial smell is boozy and slightly fruity, certainly not a true indication of what's to come.
The taste is incredible. This beer explodes on your tongue with amazing complexity. There is coffee first, maybe some deep, dark chocolate, then a hint of fruit (raisin, maybe even prune) and then a bit of charred oak flavor. As it warms, you get a hit of the hoppy bitterness.
Although there is not a lot of carbonation, there is a lingering tingle on the tongue. This is a very complex beer!
The mouthfeel is wonderful. Full and substantial and a little creamy.
Simply put, overall, a great beer. One of the best I've ever had. Bravo Deschutes! 911 charactersSD-Alefan, Feb 02, 2014

Poured from the bottle.
The beer poured jet-black.
The nose had chocolate, berry, raisin, coffee, and charred oak notes. It also had a sweetness to it.
The beer tasted like charred oak with dark molasses, and finished with coffee. Another sipping-beer.
Would I buy it again? Yes. 297 charactersNilocRellim, Jan 28, 2014

Smells of oatmeal, slight bourbon, chocolate, and some roasted nuttiness.
Taste has the smell notes but also more woody notes and some subtle dark fruits. Very complex and nicely sweet yet the ibu's do come through. This one hasn't been aged so I'm sure that's why the ibu's are coming through more prominently, which I like. I can't talk more about the woody, sweet, brownie,and subtle bourbon notes. 
Mouthfeel is nicely thick and the carbonation is mild. Overall this one is pretty dangerously tasty. I compare it to the slices of chocolate cake I only get once a year for fear I'll overdue it. 715 characterslsummers, Jan 27, 2014

A - Thick, motor oil black body. Towering cap of milk chocolate brown head. Awesome retention and lace. 
S - Fresh toasted wheat, sesame seeds, vanilla, bread dough, and dusty grain silos.
T - Toasted grains and warm bread crust permeate the flavor profile. Milk chocolate, vanilla, and caramel sweeten the center, and are balanced by ash, soft tannins, oatmeal, and molasses. Touch of anise and burnt chocolate through the finish.
M - Outstandingly creamy. Smooth, full body.
O - Surprisingly little barrel character, but the quality of the blend comes through in the smoothness and balance of the beer. 671 charactersvfgccp, Jan 20, 2014

Smell- Wonderful. Chocolate, Cherries, Molasses, Bourban, Oak, Wine. 
Taste/Mouthfeel- Follows the nose perfectly. A pure joy to drink. I have never been a big wine fan, but this beer makes me feel completely different. The wine-aging has done wonders to this already complex brew. The mouthful is a little thinner than expected, but a minor problem. 
Overall- This is a beautiful, well-made beer that is only surpassed by BCBS itself. Worth every penny of the price/shipping to get this. Am aging a bottle right now, and would like to see how it tastes in about a year. 697 characterswinningwes91, Jan 19, 2014

Pours a glorious jet black with sludgy light brown head
Nose- great nose, not immensely potent- bourbon, semi-sweet milk chocolate, caramel, raisins/figs
Taste- begins with smooth and sweet bourbon, vanilla, caramel, and subtle chocolate, turns a bit sweet and fruity with dark fruits and soft citrus. Finishes light with vanilla/oak with a little bit of char
Feel- surprisingly light for this big of a stout, sweet, lush, roasty
Fantastic. I think I should've let this sit til October, not as complex or robust as I had hoped 570 charactersevanforbeer, Jan 16, 2014

Appearance is jet black with a creamy tan head. For the style it is right on point
Smell is so complex you can just spend a few minutes thinking about what you are taking away. Oak, dark chocolate, coffee, bourbon. But all components are not overpowering. They marry well together.
Taste is decadent and so smooth the ABV is really well hidden. Chocolate, Coffee, Oak, Fig just to highlight a few things. Again, like the nose they are all very well balanced together.
Mouthfeel is rich and coats the palate pleasantly.
Overall just an outstanding example of the style and worth the investigative trip to find. This beer is a must try. 722 charactersPBIU, Jan 12, 2014

pours a pitch black with a slight head. the smell is pretty complex with a ton of oak and dark chocolate...taste is very bitter for a stout, lots of coffee and oak. no sweetness at all. might be too hot? alcohol definitely apparent. full bodied for sure. correct carbonation.
overall an extremely bitter stout. not my favorite...needs age. will re review in a year or when i drink an older vintage. 431 charactersAxnjxn, Jan 12, 2014

-Appearance is thick and dark, dark brown with a tan finger of head. Gorgeous.
-Smells of Sweet Coffee with a hint of fruit, vanilla, bourbon, and oak. Fantastic.
-Taste is similar to the smell with Chocolate and Coffee backed up by Cherry, Oak, Bourbon. Then it finishes with a roasty coffee and vanilla taste. Man the 11% is hidden so well.
-The Mouthfeel is thick and slightly carbonated that lingers with a hint of bitterness.
-Overall, I really couldn't ask for anything more. It's Terrific. A bourbon aged stout is honestly my favorite smell on the planet right now. This one does not disappoint. I've cellared another and can't wait to find out how it ages. :) 860 charactersAlron, Jan 11, 2014

Context: Shared bottles of '11 and '12 vintages with Dactrius and lunarbrew today, 6/10/2013; blinded & in snifter glasses. The review is based on my preferred vintage, 2012.
Aroma: Really really complex stuff. Smells incredibly mellow with a good chunk of chocolate and dark fruits. A little bit of roasted black coffee. The rest is pretty boozy. It promises a heavy night ahead for us. (4)
Colour: Typical imperial stout. Very dark brown, nearly black and opaque beer that is incredibly thick. Pours with a small &lt;1 cm mocha head that sticks around as a thick film on top of the beer. Very tasty looking, but not necessarily heads and tails above other imperial stouts I've seen. (4)
Flavour: Nice! Super smooth but it roundhouse kicks you in the face with the sheer booziness and dark fruits. Very, very aggressive dark fruit (figs, dates) sweetness with a wee bit of vanilla. Not much oak, which isn't surprising as Abyss isn't even half barrel aged. But I really enjoyed the flavour profile on this beer. (4.25)
Mouthfeel: Really, really thick bodied and creamy in the mouth. Carbonation was OK, nothing special. The beer leaves a thin brown film when I swirl it, really thick beer. The lacing wasn't anything special, but damn this beer is really thick and creamy, very enjoyable to drink. The only thing that detracts from here is the booziness- you can taste the heat even from the beginning. (4.5)
Overall: the '12 was incredibly mellow, creamy and tasty. The '11 was a bit more subdued, not as "punch in the face" as the '12, but I appreciated the greater intensity of the flavours in the '12. It's a very excellent imperial stout that I would definitely grab a bottle per year if I had better access to Deschutes beers. (4.25)
Re-review: 2013 version, on tap at Verdugo Bar in Glendale, Los Angeles. 12oz poured into a snifter glass yesterday, 1/6/2014.
Appearance looks just like the '11 and '12, at least how I remember it. At the very least, it looks black and foreboding, opaque. Smells smoothed out actually, no booziness at all. Similar and very complex nose. And flavour is great- dark fruits, roast and dark malts, chocolate and coffee, a little licorice. Complex and not boozy at all. Medium bodied, creamy, not hard to drink at all. Very smooth and hides ABV well. I'm starting to think that while Abyss is good to drink years later, I suspect that with the decrease in % barrel-aged components, you might as well start drinking it fresh. Because fresh '13 vintage is the best I've had so far versus 1-year old '12 and 2-year old '11. 2,579 charactersStevedore, Jan 08, 2014

Pours out pitch black with a thin head that looks like whipped hot milk on top of a hot chocolate. In the nose, I get chocolate, coffee, vanilla, berries, stone fruits, and a punch of booze. Up front in the flavor there is loads of roasted malts and dark berries with a touch of tartness. Chocolate come out in the middle with coffee on towards the finish. Vanilla pokes its head out around the middle, but is not beating you over the head, like typical barrel aged stouts. I pick up some buttery toffee as well. Chocolate covered cherries linger on in the aftertaste. Delicious. Boozy touch in the finish, but not as prevalent as in the nose. Light acidity refreshes the palate. I'm glad I sat on this for a year. Mouthfeel is full, but not overly thick as the flavor profile would suggest. Mild carbonation. This is a fantastic stout, utilizing a blend of non-barrel aged stouts alongside different barrel aged expressions. An excellent example of blending skill over aging a stout 100% in cloyingly vanilla-forwarded bourbon barrels. Excellent. 1,061 charactersgoochpunch, Jan 06, 2014

This poured with an obvious thickness that oozed into the glass to display the darkest of onyx hues. The head grew out of nothing as there seemed to be little carbonation in the pour. The head was a deep brown foam that left significant lacing.
I catch some thickness in the nose as well as maple, caramel, molasses, raisin and malt come through.
The flavor, though, is more dry with pronounced coffee roast, chocolate malt, slight coffee, licorice and molasses.
This is smooth on the tongue with a light carbonation and a relatively viscous feel.
This is very good, not as rich and diverse as I expected but it may have mellowed over the years. 655 charactersKYGunner, Jan 06, 2014

S: Moderately strong aromas of dark, roasted malts are present in the nose along with notes of oak from the barrel aging. 
T: The taste starts out with lots of flavors of roasted malts and is accompanied by complimentary notes of bourbon, cherries, dark fruits, molasses and oak flavors. The roasted malt flavors linger from start to finish. The cherries become a little stronger as the beer warms up. 
M: It feels medium- to full-bodied and slightly dry on the palate with a moderate amount of carbonation. 
O: As a mixture of blends, this beer is extremely well balanced and doesn't have any one dominant flavor. The taste is very complex.

Looks amazing, dark black with a thick creamy coffee tan film, great lacing. 4.75
S- dark cherry, spicy oak, lots of black strap mollasus, walnut nuttiness, huge depth Of interesting flavours, dark chocolate, lots of coffee, with a subtle dark fruit edge. 4.75
T- mollasus, dark rich spicy notes, lots of wine tannins, cherry and black current, pepperiness stand out on the tongue. Quite a bit of oak. A moderate touch of initial sweetness then tends into a deep dark abyss of alluring flavours, flavour and balance truly defy description. More oak than I expected but what an amazing stout. 4.75
M- big body, with a moderate carbonation, creamy and spicy with lots of oak, hints of strapping alcohol but for the strength it really isn't overbearing, dry finish with oaky mollasus spiciness. 4.5
Certainly one world class stout, brings a huge complex flavour at this strength with a ton of richness and no heat. Deep dark molasses flavour, lots of spicy oak. Amazing balance and complexity, haven't had it fresh but aged is really inspiring, great complexity and spiciness. Definitely one of the best stouts I've ever had. If I could but a case I would. 4.75 1,180 charactersmick303, Jan 02, 2014

a: deep, dark, rich black with just the slights hint of brown. large 3 finger mahogany tan head that sticks around nicely
s: the smell on this is unreal. dark chocolate, leather, plums, raisin, fig, sweet black licorice, oak, dates, rich toffee. has some berry esters as well. this is crazy complex and amazing. you can pick up the various barrels - coconuts, vanilla, and very slight vinous notes.
t: very similar to the nose. rich chocolate and toasted malts hit you right away. next you're hit with the oak, tobacco, and the dark fruits - raisins, prunes, figs, pomegranates, and brown sugar. i'm picking up cherries in here too - sweet cherries, its real nice. then it fades to a rich molasses and creamy toffee. the flavor then circles back around and ends with the toasted malts.
m: heavy mouthfeel, with a nice amount of carbonation - not too much
o: perfect. this deserves 100. do yourself a favor and make sure to inhale through the nose as you take each sip 999 charactershopsputin, Jan 01, 2014

Pours heavy pitch black with huge foamy brown head. I wish every stout could look like this.
Smell is definitely complex. Sweet. Chocolate, caramel, and vanilla up front, followed by a little boozy red wine.
Taste is again sweet, but not overly so. So much going on here. Chocolate and vanilla with the soft boozyness, followed by molasses, cherry, and a very slight alcohol burn. So complex and delicious!
The feel of this one is wonderful. Incredibly smooth and creamy. Very heavy bodied, the carbonation barely comes through. 
Overall this was a treat! Not sure how much the 14 months age did for it as I haven't enjoyed this fresh before (instructed to at least age a year per the bottle). I'll definitely be looking forward to the annual release of this in the future. 841 charactersd5001986, Jan 01, 2014

Very complex, and all of the flavore are well integrated and not "in your face". Roasted malts, bitter dark chocolate, oak, vanilla, bourbon... Then as it warms, vinous character comes out with some dark, dried fruits. Abv stays well hidden, the mouthfeel is full but maybe a touch lighter than I want. 
Excellent beer, one of the best I've had overall so far. 483 charactersgaruda, Dec 29, 2013

4.29/5  rDev -4.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25"Some Nietzsche quote."
A: Lives up to its namesake. Seems to absorb light, like a black hole. Finger and a half of tight, creamy head. Lacing is stellar, as is retention. Head is espresso in color, with some large bubbles present. Looks intimidating. 
S: Moar ingredients. The barrel isn't immediately present in the nose. Big roasted barley, chocolate, coffee, vanilla, baker's cocoa, milk chocolate, slightly woodsy/barky, (whattya know, cherry bark!), leather, some cigar box and cinnamon. Some herbal hoppiness hidden way underneath. I read a review that mentioned a savory or soy sauce element in a RIS. That's present here. It's a biggun. 
T: First off, this is a monster beer. Not so much in the ABV's or the mouthfeel, but in the awesome torched bitterness present. It is seriously overpowering. Believe the bottle when it says best after. Underneath the roaring roastiness are big coffee and bitter chocolate notes with...black pepper? Definitely prickles the sinuses. These mellow out. Vanilla pops up, as does oak and the same leafy/bark quality, raisinied fruit is there, baker's chocolate, espresso grounds. The barrel characteristics play second fiddle to the other flavors in this beer. Oak, vanilla and bourbon pop up, but are mostly background to the insane malt bitterness of this beast. This one lingers. The charring, almost astringent malt sticks with you long after you have taken a sip. Truly a beast. 
M: As jumbled as the flavors are, the mouthfeel is spot on. Some slight alcohol heat greets you in the end, but otherwise this one strikes a perfect balance. The carbonation is ample, without being distracting. The body is sufficiently heavy, without being cloying. Excellent. 
O: This one needs to be lain down for at least a year. It is delicious, no doubt. However, as of right now, this beer currently rides a fine balance. At colder temperatures, the roasted malt dominates every aspect of the experience. As the beer warms it mellows, but the alcohol heat accentuates some of the spice characteristics and this tends to overwhelm the beer. There are a lot of awesome flavors in here, but I think they do need some time to settle down. 2,172 charactersMcStagger, Dec 28, 2013

It exceeded my expectations in every way and has become
one of my favorites. Black wax adds to the evil look of the bottle. 2009 vintage.
A - Sometimes hard to open the cap, as the wax can be thick and have to muscle it off unless you have a knife laying around.
Pours a deep opaque brown, very close to a jet black. Some caramel color at the edges but otherwise dense. Big tan head and nice lacing
S - Very inviting smell of dark roasted malts, chocolate, coffee, oak, bourbon, maybe some dark fruit
T - I am in heaven, same as the smell in the taste , and also an interesting flavor maybe from the molasses and licorice. This is truly world class and original of a taste.
M - Thick and luscious, this is a dessert for the beer lover.
I don't see how you can make mouthfeel better really, it isnt too thick or thin.
D - Really drinkable, minus the 11% alc , need to sip this one or share with friends. They'll be glad you shared too.
 I'm glad that Deschutes has increased production of this, as i have 5 bottles aging in my closet. This is my favorite beer of all time, so I'm giving it a perfect score!

Revisiting this beer for 2013 vintage.
Pours very black, with a huge tan head that holds nicely.
Smells of huge chocolate and coffee, fresh coffee, with dark cherry, plums, figs, tobacco, oak, some red wine notes, huge complex smell.
Taste is out of this world. Big oaky taste, with cocoa and coffee, with some bourbon, vanilla, bitter hops, kind of harsh at this point but super complex.
Feel is perfect. Can't get any more smooth with loads of flavor per sip and generous carbonation. Slick and delicious.
I am in love with this beer. 1,699 charactersBastardKing24, Dec 25, 2013

A: Poured the blackest of balck into my Duvel tulip. A thin ring of mocha colored head graced the the pour like icing on a cake. Carbonation appears fine, and plentiful. As the blackness recedes, lacing adorns the glass like fine strings of crystal from a chandalier. The viscosity is thick and smooth. No other characteristics can be determined due to the lack of light pentetration into the glass.
S: Layer after layer of aroma. First, you get a wallop of ground coffee beans followed by something richer; vanilla and smoky oak. Hints of tobacco, dried figs, and coconut round out the edges. 
T: Begins with a strong coffee and dark chocolate flavors with essenses of toast. Strong malt backbone, this is certainly a full bodied brew. Vanilla and oak echo in the dark. The flavors transition mid palate which I think speaks to the complexity of this beer. Finshes very sharp with a taste that can be described as smoked weeping willow with an alcholic sting. I wasn't expecting this. No doubt due to the variety of barrel aging involved in it's creation. Speaking of the barrell aging, it lurks in the background, it's not the highlight, but contributes strongly to the overall flavor profile.
M: Carbonation is perfect. Lucious and velvety, with just the right level of stickiness, nothing has been lost on the year of aging. Oils the mouth in all the right ways. Finshes relatively dry, but I like that. Keeps you coming back for more. 
O: This beer lived up to the hype. It's one to sit back and sip, take in the sights and sounds, and appreciate. Even though it may be snowy outside, Abyss will take you to somewhere....delecious. 1,654 characterscooler4life, Dec 23, 2013

Now that presentation is just killer. Three fingers of THICK, gorgeously creamy, rich brown froth sits atop a beer that looks... well, like an abyss, appropriately. The head makes a smooth mound that just won't go away, and lovely lacing is left behind when it finally recedes a bit. A true stunner.
Yikes. The aroma is also killer. It packs so VERY much delicious complexity, it just overwhelms me. Let's see... RICH milk and dark chocolates, vanilla, molasses, this refined (as opposed to out of control) smoky, woody oakiness, freshly ground coffee, and some earthy raisins... maybe some plums and subtle licorice. There are probably other things going on too, but they're too mysterious for me to know how to describe...
This stuff UNLOADS flavors of chocolate and earth on the palate without reserve. It has a maltiness that's milky-sweet at first, moves to tart, chocolate-covered rasins, and then turns to more bitter things like coffee and unsweetened, pure chocolate. The finish is quite special. Once again, I'll say it has a REFINED, complex, and distinctive woody character that goes along very well with the abundantly earthy aftertaste. I think I can TASTE the complexity that things like the cherry bark and various partial barrel aging imparted onto this beer. And it's totally delicious.
The feel is thick and chewy, with lax carbonation that makes for a silky-smoth body.
I must say, the Abyss delivers a devastating dose of chocolate, oak, and earth, wrapped up in a bunch of other things that just enhance the overall stout experience. An imperial stout that boasts expertly controlled, balanced power and intensity. 1,677 charactersKuaff, Dec 22, 2013

A- The pour produces a two-finger head that's cappuccino in color... The head is foamy, frothy and thick enough to support a bottle cap... The beer itself is pitch black and opaque... There's abundant lacing left about the glass.
S- Deep dark chocolate hits my nose first, then hints of coffee, some roasted malt, some oak and something sweet like molasses. The smells are somewhat subdued.
T- Bitter baker's chocolate dominates, but theres some sweet roasted malt to offer some balance, creamy toffee and vanilla emerge after some time, as do the oaky, barrel-like features... There's also some bitter hoppiness and wine-like grapiness at the finish.
M- The beer starts very bitter, but then becomes creamy and smooth, before finishing dry, bitter and vinous like a red wine. 
O- A complex beer that didn't quite deliver as I'd expect on the nose, but it came alive on my tongue. Very tasty. I look forward to aging a few of these bottles to see what more the beer has to offer. 1,024 charactersONovoMexicano, Dec 21, 2013

A- Pours an intensely opaque black color with a 1/4 inch light brown head that retains briefly before becoming a thick ring around the edge of the glass and a few bubbles of surface foam. Non-resilient lacing slides quickly down the glass.
S- Sweet dark roasted malt brings forth notes of molasses, vanilla and toasted marshmallow. The oak gives it a good amount of depth and the booze is certainly there but not too intense.
T- Deep, dark roasted malt has big notes of char well on into the aftertaste. Not sensing a whole lot of barrel but I guess that's due to them decreasing the amount of beer that's aged in the barrels each year. It's mainly the heavy malt, booze and hints of vanilla that I get out of it. Good, but I was hoping for more complexity like the smell was leading on.
M- Thick but not creamy. Medium-low carbonation and a full body.
O- I wouldn't say this was a letdown but it's certainly not worth all the hype. I got a lot more "wow" factor from Dissident and Black Butte XXIV. 1,135 charactersImmortale25, Dec 20, 2013

4.76/5  rDev +6.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75This is a God-tier dark beer. Just absolutely fantastic. Picked up 5 bottles of the 2013, opened 1 to enjoy now. Poured into a Bordeaux glass.
A - Dark as dark beers get. Almost doesn't let any light through when held up to a bright lamp. Head is a little under a finger, poured into a very wide glass - light milk-chocolate in color.
S - Roasted coffee beans, a sweet fruity-ness to the smell, typical stout smells as well, a little bit of irish cream from the bourbon barrel.
T - Good god this is tasty (fresh and with age). Chocolate, coffee, a little bit of tree bark/earthy notes, flavors of the different barrels: bourbon (very light - almost like Bailey's), oak, wine (also subtle), french vanilla covered in chocolate syrup. Opened another bottle with about 4-5 months age, and the flavors are roughly the same. More chocolate notes come out with age as the light coffee starts to disappear. 
M - Like liquid silk running over your tongue. Almost no bite to this beer. Alcohol content weighs it down a bit, but not too heavy, just a perfect dark beer mouthfeel. 
O - Easily one of my favorite beers of all time and one I will look for every year it comes out. I also look forward to putting a year or two of aging on a couple bottles. If I find any more, I will definitely be snatching it up.

Deschutes "Obsidian Stout" is one of my all time favorite black beers, "The Abyss" strikes me as a gloriously fancy and muscled up version of Ob. Opaque black, nice dark tan head that lays down quickly, plenty of sticky lacing. Aroma is bold and complex: dark roasty malts, boozy, oak and wine lingering. Taste is similar... plenty of hops and dark malt to offset any sweetness, a bit bitter when cold and the balance does transition to sweeter as it warms. Big and boozy and roasty, not overly whiskey, so the other elements aren't swamped out. Vanilla and dark chocolate notes come out as the party continues. Mouthfeel is perfect for a big burly dark: syrupy thickness slaked by the hot alcohol, and plenty of carbonation to sharpen the tongue.
Probably not everyman's brew, but for those of us who live for the dark, The Abyss is top notch, setting a standard that is rarely matched. I'd give it "5" across the board, but I'll bet it improves even more after additional aging, so I have to leave room for that! 1,189 charactersryannosaurus, Dec 19, 2013

4.9/5  rDev +9.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Serving Type- In to a Tulip Glass from Tap
Appearance- Black as night, it almost sucks the light out of the room, very little head, the head is coco brown, one of the darkest beers around
Smell- Typical Imperial Stout smells, chocolate, roasted notes, roasted coffee, molasses, hints of Barrel aging.
Taste- Smooth, dark roasted chocolate, roasted dark coffee, molasses hints of charred barrel aging,
Mouth Feel- Smooth, thick Imperial Stout
Overall- An amazing beer if you are able to get it on tap do yourself a favor and do so...but it does do better in a bottle after a few years of aging to figure itself out. But one of the best beers on the PLANET period... 669 charactersTony49er, Dec 17, 2013

Huge dark coffee/dark chocolate/rich roasted malt flavors and characteristics. Interesting light bitter hop in the mid palate. Strong coffee and dark chocolate finish. This ale is very well made and with pleasant burnt espresso and dark chocolate flavors with big coffee/chocolate finish with hints of bitter hops. (This review was done in 2009)
REVISITED May 22, 2009 with a 2009 Reserve a few months after the tasting that gave rise to previous comments. Suffice it to say that bottle here tasted was huge with chocolate/coffee-espresso/licorice character and flavors and with a creamy mouthfeel and character lacking in the previous bottle. I'm a stout lover and this may have been one of the nicest stout experiences I've had since I tried the 2003 Imperial Russian Stout that Stone broke out at it's 2009 Winterstorm (best stout I've ever tasted). This one is my number one "available" stout. Try it!
REVISTED December 14, 2013 with 2013 Reserve. Beer has gotten significantly more hopped and has lost much of it's mouthfeel and intense flavor. Still a very nice and well made beer but my over all rating has now gone from a 4.7+ (under the old rating scores) to a 3.75; still very good but not "outstanding." This was once a standard by which others could be judged. No more; the world has caught up with and surpassed Abyss. JMO 1,406 charactersGRG1313, Dec 15, 2013

This beer pours as black as I've ever seen a beer. True motor oil pour. Some dark cocoa lacing with good retention.
Smell is woody. Oaky from the barrels but also a more earthy wood likely from the tree bark. Tobacco, molasses aromas. A lightly fruity note is present as well. Not much bourbon or heat.
Drinks very nicely. Taste is robust and roasty, not highly hopped or bitter. The additives of cherry bark and back strap molasses really work well, but I don't pick up a ton of vanilla. Very little bourbon or wine taste, but the barrel character is present. However, if you didn't tell me it was barrel-aged, I might not have guessed it was.
Mouthfeel is low carbonation, full, smooth, creamy, pretty ideal.
Overall, a tasty tasty brew. It doesn't try to be the biggest or booziest, but is just really well-crafted. I preferred the '11 to the '12 but they were very similar. May re-review this when drinking a '10 which different barrel ratios. 1,039 charactersMCain04, Dec 14, 2013

Aroma - The most up front aroma is the roast/coffee notes, followed closely by raisins and dried fruit.
Appearance - Inky black, opaque. Brownish head, frothy.
Flavor - First tastes of raisins, prunes, and molasses. Notes of toffee and toasted almonds. Oak is mellow, almost vanilla-like at this point.
Mouthfeel - Perfectly cloying, leaving just the right amount coating the palate after swallowing.
Overall Impression - My favorite age for this beer, sad it was the last bottle. 556 charactersPetitChouffe, Dec 11, 2013

The beer pours out very black with about a finger of tan, well-sustained head. As for the nose, let's just say I could smell this the moment the cap came off. Tons of fudge along with some vanilla and oak. There are also hints of coffee and dark chocolate. There's a lot there and it would take a while to identify a lot of it. I can't wait that long...
Very full body with a monstrously rich flavor and a superb feel. (This beer has the creamy feel down pat!) Lots of dark, roasty, espresso, chocolate, and charred fruit notes abound. It's like a super-concentrated Russian Imperial Stout. There's just so much going on! The molasses, malt, and barrel-aging all contribute to make this thing taste like a burnt-coffee-and-chocolate-cake-milkshake. I also get just a hint of ruby port on the back of the palate. Not sure if I'm getting the licorice or vanilla, but it doesn't matter. The flavor of this beer just blows me away. It's delightfully complex and perfectly toes the line between bitter, sweet, and savory.
I can see why they call this beer ``The Abyss''. The roastiness combines with the molasses to make a beer with an RIS flavor so intense, your tastebuds get lost in it. If you are a fan of Russian Imperial Stouts, you need to get yourself a bottle of this. I can see why it's considered a classic and why its release is so anticipated every year.
When you look into the Abyss, the Abyss also looks into you...and says ``Drink me''. 1,538 charactersdeadonhisfeet, Dec 10, 2013

A - Completely inky black with a one-finger brown head. Decent lacing.
S - Very powerful blast of bourbon, vanilla, charred wood, molasses and chocolate. Smells inviting and complex.
T - Follows the nose well with chocolate being even more prevalent; hints of prune and date as well. Oak detectable in the mid-palate. Espresso bean notes throughout. Nice smoky finish. All flavors deep, robust, and complex. Delicious.
M - Lighter side of medium bodied; medium carbonation. Very slick and slightly oily on the tongue. Honestly, a bit of flaw here and I really wanted it to be bigger and chewier to match the awesome flavor profile. 
O - A delicious and robust stout that lives up to the hype. Had a fresh bottle last year and lots of hot bourbon in the taste; aging this beer has benefited it immensely. Worth the price! 860 charactersTempeBeerMan, Dec 08, 2013

A: Pours and extremely dark brown, nearly black. Pitch black in the glass. About 1.5 fingers of chocolate milk brown head. Black, with a dark golden brown edge, in the dimple. Nice, yet slightly thing, multi-tiered lacing. A faint sheeting.
S: Chocolate cereal, with a light note of black licorice, and faint char. A slight woody note. The fainest hint of a floral note.
T/MF: Velvety smooth on the palate. More dry cocoa/chocolate cereal. Moves into a sharply sweet licorice flavor, before finishing with more char, and a faint bit of graphite. Very dark chocolate, as it warms. Ends a little dark for my tastes, but all in all, fairly good. A definite improvement over the '13.
Poured from a 22 oz. bottle, into a Belgian tulip glass.
Original review: Deschutes' The Abyss (2013 Reserve). Stout brewed with black strap molasses, licorice, cherry bark, and vanilla. 6% aged in oak bourbon barrels, 11% oak barrels, and 11% oak wine barrels. 11% ABV.
A: Black with half a finger's chocolate brown head. Decent, fine lacing.
S: Some decent bourbon and cocoa aromas. Some notes of a finer wood than oak, like a new desk. Hmm, it gives me that odd sensation where sniff it causes a perfumey sweetness on the tip of my tongue. Not sure what that's from. I'm not getting as much smell from this as I would have expected, so it may still need to warm up. A slight licorice/char note in the background.
T/MF: Okay, a little more complexity here. Char, very dark chocolate, light coffee, slight licorice, artificial sweetener, some kind of floral note. There is a dry white wine backing of some sort. Sauv Blanc, maybe? Almost creamy texture. Bourbon comes through as it warms, towards the back
Pretty good, but not one of my favorite stouts. Thankfully, I didn't pay for this one. I would have been quite disappointed if I had forked out $16 for it.

A- Very thick and intensely black with small mocha colored head that left very little lace.
S- Big coconut, roasted coffee, chocolate, acidic red wine notes, vanilla, cherry, some bourbon and oak. Intensely aromatic 
T- Big rich dark chocolate, roasted coffee, acidic red wine, cherry, plums, raisins, bourbon, black licorice, and coconut. Some vanilla and oak notes. Really decadent, complex, and delicious. Pretty high bitterness but it is cut really well by the alcohol presence.
M- Thick, full-bodied, super smooth and creamy, big warming, but no alcohol burn. The ABV is well hidden and although it is a sipper it goes down so easy and smooth.
O- Easily one of the greatest beers I have ever had, pure perfection. I have not been a huge fan of some of the more highly regarded imperial stouts, but this one absolutely lives up to the name. 894 charactersHoptometrist, Dec 07, 2013

Poured into a Chimay chalice and glorious fumes are already wafting my way. Pours solid black with just about the darkest head I've seen. I think I could get drunk from the aroma alone: layers of rich, intoxicating chocolate, molasses, licorice and more barrel than expected. Faint coffee notes linger deep in the complex goodness. Wonderful flavors, but way hotter than expected. I guess that's what I get for cracking my 2013 vintage before its "best after" date. Rich chocolate, smoky malts, espresso, bourbon and I'm definitely picking up more of that licorice note I detected on the nose. Complex and nuanced, with some age this would be just about perfect. Mouthfeel is thick and wonderful but compromised somewhat by the alcohol bite. Very glad to have tried this. A little peeved at myself for not aging it just a bit and waiting for that "best after" date's fruition. But it's okay - I have another bottle!

Black body with a finger's width of milk chocolate colored foam. Foam dies pretty quickly once you start sipping.
Aromas in The Abyss include coffee, some char, dark chocolate, and molasses. Very strong scents, much more roasty than sweet, bourbon is barely perceptible.
Flavors are much like the nose, loads of coffee grounds to start things off. Then dark chocolate becomes apparent mid-palate. It does not last long before char takes over. There is a little bit of the bourbon heat and oakiness in the finish as well. Really though, that char is STRONG.
The Abyss has no issue in the feel department, very smooth and great heft. Dry from the char on the palate.
The Abyss does have some nice variety to it, however, I would have had no idea that this was aged in wine barrels. Also, it is very roasty and charred on the palate. It certainly needs to mellow out before I want to give this one a go again. 932 charactersPintofbrown, Dec 03, 2013

A - Pours a nice dark brown, deep and rich, that if not so dark would actually be clear. There was a nice one finger mocha head that faded to leave nice wisps clouds and some creamy lacing.
S - Aromas of nice charred wood, some faint grapey vinus notes, some very light bourbon vanilla sweetness, light licorice, chocolate is rather faint. Was expecting more. Plus, it is a bit boozy on the nose as well.
T - Taste is fair amount of old smokey char. As solid as the nose was the taste is that much better. Lots of smooth, rich bourbon and nice barrel based vanilla. The licorice is super subtle and balances wonderfully with the nice smokey charred oak this has going on. The pinot noir barrel fades in and out with each passing sip. Very nice caramel notes too. Much more complex than the nose. On the exhale I get wonderful black licorice washing across the pallet. As this beer warms up I get a BUNCH more black licorice. 
M - Mouthfeel is great considering this is an 11% beer. I do get a little bit of alcohol but for the most part this is nice and thick and chewy. 
O - Overall this was a great beer. I was hugely disappointed by the nose and was preparing for this to be underwhelming. Glad my initial thoughts were wrong. 1,314 charactersrudzud, Dec 03, 2013

A- Jet black with coffee colored head with medium lacing and great retention.

T- Muted taste compared with the nose.... but in a good way. I hate black liquorice, so if that dominated in any way; I would be upset. I am just getting a thick molasses RIS with some booze at the end. Black liquorice is the last taste
M- Pretty thick, about as thick as Berserker. Less thick than Zhukov. I enjoy the mouthfeel on this beer. 
O- I have heard that Berserker and The Abyss are two good beers to compare. I would generally agree but say that Abyss has the black liquorice and Berserker has more Molasses. Both great beers that would cellar very well. I prefer Berserker; even though it is rated lower. To each his own. 878 charactersgueuzedreg, Dec 01, 2013

4.42/5  rDev -1.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5This is the 2010 vintage, which I managed to not drink for a year (I'm very proud). Dismal swamp dark with tan head, very viscous with little or no lacing after it settles. Smell is of dark chocolate, coffee, molasses, black licorice and alcohol.
This is what it's all about. You get that dark chocolate and espresso bitterness complemented by a molasses, toffee sweetness. Bourbon barrel characteristics make their presence known (whiskey, oak, vanilla) in the back half. The finish is somewhat dry, but not decidedly so.
This is an incredibly crafted ale where the high ABV is so well hidden in the complexity of flavors. I have a 2011 edition that I'll cellar for a year (I could only get one), but it'll be tough to not want to crack it open before that. This one lives up to the hype.
UPDATE: Currently enjoying the 2012 Reserve. The only thing I would add is a more pronounced smoky character to this batch. It's like drinking a little bit of campfire. And who doesn't like a campfire? 994 charactersRandyV, Nov 30, 2013

Appearance: Black in color with a thin brown/orange head. The head was quite colorful which eventually dissipated away.
Smell: picked up vanilla, oak, molasses, chocolate, and bourbon. 
Taste: It feels like melting dark chocolate and tastes like it too. You can taste the oak barrels without a doubt. Not much coffee I thought with this years. 
Mouthfeel: full bodied mouth feel, very smooth; maybe just wish it was a little bit thicker. 480 charactersCeltics17, Nov 28, 2013

Appearance: jet black in color with a thin brown/orange head. The head was quite colorful which eventually dissipated away. 
Smell: picked up vanilla, black licorice, oak, molasses, chocolate, and bourbon. Very fragrant, a lot to pick up. The black licorice is definitely a big component of this aroma. 
Taste: this is quite complex; its both bitter and sweet. Upon sipping it, it starts sweet and quickly the bitterness folds into the sweetness. Very balanced. Picked up dark sweet cherries, chocolate, some vanilla, and bourbon as it warms up. The heat becomes more pronounced as the beer warms up. Drinking this is almost like eating bittersweet chocolate coated on dried cherries. Maybe just a little tart but not too tart. 
Mouthfeel: full bodied mouth feel, very smooth; maybe just wish it was a little bit thicker. 
Overall: outstanding beer! As it warms up, the complexity builds up. Love the black licorice and vanilla aromas and love how neither sweet nor bitterness dominate the flavors. 1,043 charactersBenish, Nov 27, 2013

smooth, roasted malt taste. deja vu from old days from some English porter or stout I had at Der Baron's in Las Vegas many moons ago... I get the licorice and molasses, although it's not overwhelming... some bitterness... espresso or coffee?
looking at the label: says best AFTER 8/6/2014. so I should be storing this somewhere, apparently? i'm drinking a premature brew? is it veal? I guess i'll not refrigerate my other ones, then... but I cant say this is a "100" in anyway. too many other great stouts out there.... 802 characterspkalix, Nov 23, 2013

A: pours a very very dark brown. pretty close to black, but just a shade under. head is a deep dark brown. frothy. good retention and TONS of lacing. I think this thing has legs. looks big. 
S: chocolate milk. vanilla beans. licorice root (minor). chocolate powder. minor oak. silken oaky vanilla. inviting. 
T: starts very sweet. a minor pepper/hot spice to it. milk chocolate tons of coffee in the finish. bitter and roasty. slightly metallic? I think it is more of a weird twang better the bittersweet flavors. a minor tobacco as well. im not getting any heat. at all. quite the task for a brew of this size.
M: money. silky and smooth. full-bodied, but not obnoxiously. 
D: I must say I love the "best after" date on these big beers from Deschutes. similar to breweries that hold their big beers for conditioning before releasing, I like how these guys are doing it with a date on the bottle. I cannot believe the utter lack of booze heat on this thing. makes it dangerously drinkable. wish I was getting a tad more bourbon, but that is my only complaint. and it is more of a wish. seek. 1,172 charactersJimmys, Nov 22, 2013

Very dark brown-nearly black in colour, ring of tan head with some lace. Nose is well roasted, smoke, vanilla and oak, light coffee, a bit of sweetness and a bit of a tangy/cherry/wine notes as well. Taste is rich chocolate and roast, bourbon, oak, mild black forest cake, liquorice, a bit of coffee as well, vanilla and smoke in the aftertaste. Medium-light carbonation, full bodied. Awesome stuff, probably my favourite beer in a night full of incredible beers, would certainly like to have this again. 560 characterspeensteen, Nov 14, 2013

Pours pitch black and smells quite nice coming out of the bottle. Half a finger of tan head that dissipates rather quickly. The taste on this beer is quite fascinating. It seems like I am catching a new flavor every sip. Up front are some bittersweet dark chocolate notes and perhaps some dried fruit, cherries it seems like. Mid-palate has a surge of espresso and charred oak coming on heavily. The after taste is a bit dry and bitter, almost like I had a few coffee beans that were lightly toasted. The bourbon is very well hidden but you definitely get the charred barrel characteristics and a touch of vanilla. Quite simply one of the best stouts I have ever had, and significantly better than the 2012 Bourbon County I just tried recently. We'll see how it stacks up the Bourbon County Rare when I pop that open for my birthday. Highly recommended, I'll be getting another bottle! 952 charactersblackcoyote13, Nov 12, 2013

A: The beer is a deep black color, with a short brown head that fades slowly and leaves a very thick lace on the glass.
S: The aroma contains rich roasted malts, black coffee, chocolate, molasses, licorice and a faint touch of hops.
T: The taste starts out sweet with flavors of coffee, milk chocolate, molasses, licorice and dark fruits. Then a hearty roasted malt character quickly follows. The hops presence is very mild but given the type of beer and the fact that it’s nearly 7 years-old the shock is that there’s any hops presence at all. There’s a good balance and very little hint of the 11.00% ABV. The after-taste is slightly sweet.
M: Crisp and very smooth, medium-to-heavy body, medium carbonation, finish is sticky.
O: Very tasty, goes down dangerously easy, slightly filling, very strong kick, excellent representation of style, this is a very good big stout to drink for a long time. 1,042 charactersTheManiacalOne, Nov 12, 2013
4.65/5  rDev +3.8%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Reviewing the 2012 release here, though I'll include some notes on 2011 at the end.
First thing, I've had this both on tap at release, and from the bottle one year later. It's better from the bottle, and that's the one I'm reviewing.
Appearance is thick and dark, it barely lets light through. Not terribly carbonated, but the viscosity keeps a good head on it.
Smell is great, a blend of cocoa, licorice and port, with just a little oak. At release the licorice came off a little strong, aging fixed it.
Tastes of cocoa and licorice at first, with the port, wood and dry chocolate coming out in the finish. Licorice is pronounced, but not unbalanced. Cleans out surprisingly well.
Mouthfeel is thick with low carbonation. Not cloying or syrupy though.
Abyss is one of my favorites, though I preferred the 2011 release. If you somehow find yourself a bottle of the '11, most of the above notes apply, but the licorice flavor comes off less, and there's more coffee taste on the finish. Both are exceptional, but personal preference will change how people feel one year to the next. 1,087 charactersMurp, Nov 11, 2013

Scents of rubbing alcohol, slight roast malt, faint hints of black coffee, some vinous wine, brown sugar, molasses and slight licorice. Very nice aroma. Deep, complex and strong. Taste begins with black coffee, rich roast malt, bittersweet cocoa and vanilla bean, with notes of oak, licorice, very faint hints of wine and hints of oak and bourbon in the background, especially as the beer warms. Finish and aftertaste are bitter, roasty and strong in black coffee. Very well done, balanced, yet assertive, aged, yet not dank. An excellent flavor. Mouthfeel is medium-thick bodied, sticky with a faint alcohol burn. Quite nice, very much a sipping beer. Overall this is another excellent, deep, complex Imperial Stout. It's strong, assertive and bold, yet balanced. Well worth drinking. 887 charactersAuraan, Nov 09, 2013

Acquired this one through a trade thinking it would be more recent and with the expectation of aging for a while, but was shocked to see it was a 2008! I've been looking forward to this one for quite some time.
A: Pours a very dark black with just shy of 1 finger of tan head that reduces slowly and leaves little to no lacing. Does not appear to be quite as thick as I had anticipated for the style and ABV, but still clearly has a good body.
S: Aroma wafts with a very rich complex profile. I definitely get a lot of charred/burnt oak on the front, then chocolate, coffee, slight molasses.
T: The flavor of this beer is easily one of my favorites for the style. Nothing is overpowering, and yet I can detect oh so much throughout the glass. I get the charred oak as the strongest flavor, with an amazing balance of chocolate, bourbon, molasses. I get an after taste of smoke that lingers ever so delicately. I love the way everything blends together so well. I haven't had this fresh, but I can only imaging the aging on this beer has done it wonders.
M: Feels slightly thicker than how it appears. Carbed very well.
O: I tremendously enjoyed this one. It comes together so well through the aroma and flavor. I'll certainly be seeking another couple out - I'd like to try one that doesn't have the age on it to see how it compares. Very well done Deschutes! 1,396 charactersroger617, Nov 02, 2013

Early 2013 rating. Brewed with molasses and liquorice, that just sounds like a joke, apparently also 33 % was BA in oak and bourbon barrels. 2011 Vintage I believe? Best after 08/04/2012. 65 cl bottle sampled. Pours black with a reasonable mocha head. Nose is sweet and licorice heavy, smooth and well integrated, touch molasses, roasted malt, underlying sweetness and coffee, anise. Bitter black liquorice taste, bitter molasses, burned coffee, chocolate, pure chocolate, bitter coffee grounds, cacao. Full, very slick, everything is well integrated. Well done and I appreciate it even with the liquorice focus. 633 characters77black_ships, Oct 23, 2013

3.96/5  rDev -11.6%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.75650ml bottle, 2012 vintage, best before 11/1/2013, close enough for me, poured into a Deschutes Teku glass.
The beer pours a deep jet black color, very opaque, hues of cola brown at the edges when struck by the light. Atop the beer rests a nice, fluffy, caramel colored head that sits about 2 fingers high that has very good retention and leaves a large network of soapy lace behind. The aroma is pleasant, bakers chocolate, lightly roasted coffee, molasses, stone fruit and red wine, some charred oak, smooth yet potent alcohol brings out some bourbon and toffee sweetness. It's busy, not quite balanced, but complex and interesting. The flavors are a bit harsher, lots of roasted malt, burnt wood, toasted coffee bean, it doesn't breach the smoked threshold, but is one of the roastiest beers I've tasted. Behind that, some nice layers of stone fruit, red wine bring out some molasses and brown sugar before bourbon, chocolate and alcohol wash over the finish. It's complex, but way out of balance, perhaps too young. The mouthfeel is nice, low carbonation but still lively, rich texture coats the mouth well before finishing easily, a little pricklier than I'd like but nice and creamy. 
Verdict: Too young? Hard to say, but the roast quality is very taxing. The complexity is rewarding, but the balance is less than admirable. I'd like to visit some older vintages with more time on them to see how this beer evolves, but for a beer that is nearly a year old, it's a bit of a shame that it's this undeveloped. 1,515 characterskevanb, Oct 15, 2013

Served in 4 sifters with family for a birthday celebration at 55 degrees
A - Beautiful pour at 55 degrees and let it warm as I drank. been aged for three years. thought this would be a proper first review. Beautiful thick, dark pour with a small brown head
S - One of the most amazing smelling beers I've had ahead of Parabola and BCBS and various other Stouts of this caliber. Chocolatey, coffee, carmel, molasses, tasty smell
T - Taste as it smells, alcohol well hidden, very drinkable, THE BEST beer i've had so far at my young age of 22. Twas a good 600th unique beer and one that I will be buying many more of. Very tasty chocolate, coffee, carmel, sweetness.... again so easy to drink
M - For my personal preference of stouts this is as good as it gets.... creamy smooth, i love the bourbon taste of the booze but this wasnt there and for this beer it fit it perfectly.. how can you say anything bad about this beer if you are a stout fan. Hands down the most tasty and drinkable IS i have had
O - There's not much that can be better about this beer. I would be interested in comparing a 2012 to a 2010 as the alcohol was so mellow and hidden. I want to snatch this beer up wherever I can find it and would be willing to pay big $ for getting this beer. With that being said I will! Living in the midwest is a drag for trying to acquire these various amazing stouts.
This one goes in the books as matching my preference perfectly for a stout. Will be buying and again many of these and can't wait to try my Dark Lord that is in route :) to compare these two beers. I have a feeling The Abyss will stand out above all. 1,643 charactersdrmcleod10, Oct 14, 2013

Black as a moonless midnight with a very dense, very thick light brown head. Cocoa and old wood aroma; molasses; slightly sweet smelling; faintly spicy (something like cinnamon). Dark and charred grain flavors; bittersweet chocolate; a well-tamed booze flavor in the background, co-mingling with well-ripened dark fruit character; vanilla. Thick and chewy; syrupy without being cloying. 
Thick, foamy sheets of lacing clinging to the glass adds to the initial appearance appeal. The melt-in-your mouth mouthfeel is incredibly satisfying. And then you come to the flavors! Oh, man!! All I can say is this monster is incredibly delightful to coat and swirl about your taste buds. All the components just come together perfectly, providing one immensely gratifying dark beer experience, one that few high ABV stouts or porters can deliver. An exceptional offering and an even more exceptional drinking experience. I look forward to opening up my 2012 release in the future...

A: Dark brown to black with a tan half-finger head that lingers. Light lacing.
S: Mmmm. Toasty malts, coffee, smokey, chocolate, vanilla, oak barrel, dark fruits. 
T: Follows nose with a heavenly flow, bringing in a bit of anise, raisins and figs. Robust, sweet and finely charred. Alcohol is well hidden, but will catch up with you soon for a pleasant buzz. 
M: Medium to heavy with lighter carbonation than I expected. Smooth and creamy. 
O: Never thought I'd get to try one of these highly sought-after stouts, but I got lucky. One of my bucket list beers and it was worth the wait. A year of aging made it memorable. 722 charactersbrewskifan55, Sep 24, 2013

4.74/5  rDev +5.8%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75A bit of a cumulative review here, as this is one of the imperial stouts that I have had the most contact with over the last seven years. First tasting was via bottle (’06) to snifter on New Year’s Day ’07. An immensely dark brown, near black pour with a huge brown head. Strong aroma of coffee, chocolate, and heavy roast. Lightly woody. Thick and creamy, but slick, mouthfeel leads to layers of coffee, bittersweet chocolate, vanilla, roast, and bourbon. A charred wood trailer comes through with hints of the 11% ABV. A very, very strong debut. Looking back it kills me that I only picked up 5-6 bottles of this release when it retailed at $4.99/bomber.
2007 batch, mid-February, draft at the Bend brewpub. $5 pours… sign me up! The first thing I notice is the aroma is much deeper and complex than I recall from bottle tastings. Dark chocolate, vanilla, heavy roast, and a subtle reminder of the bourbon barrel treatment. The layers of flavor are consistent again; maybe a little more coffee and bourbon/vanilla sweetness. Huge creamy mouthfeel. Overall I would deem this 10% better than the ’06 batch. Convinced myself to buy a case to cellar at $5.99/bomber which later on turns out to be a steal. 
2008 batch, mid-February, draft at the Bend brewpub. I just love how the complexities of this brew come forth in the aroma when served on draft. Sitting on one of my favorite brewpubs probably does add ‘bonus points’ to the experience, but it’s hard not to feel like a million bucks right now. The only negative I can pick up on this batch is a little more smoke than before and that reduces the sweetness from vanilla and the barrel treatment. I’ve appreciated the small amount of char in the prior servings and IMO that is the perfect amount. Still excellent and I went on the next day to drink several more at the KLCC Microbrew Festival in Eugene. TFD Boise got kegs of this too; awesome.
2009 batch, bottle, mid-Janurary enjoyed at home. I picked up a few of these, again, and was fortunate that none of them were infected, as the brewery suffered some growing pains while doubling the size of the release. Seems to have a little less char, which is good by me, a balanced amount of vanilla/bourbon sweetness to the dark chocolate, espresso, and heavy roast. Also picked up some anise for the first time. Very good. 
2007 batch, bottle, 2/13/2010. Drinking really great right about now. This cellared bottle is as close to the same aroma and flavor profile as the draft version that I’ve had so far. I’d proclaim that fresh on draft is king, but this bottle with two years in the cellar is quite excellent. Roast, chocolate, vanilla, espresso, moderate barrel notes, and a touch of smoke. Such a rich and creamy mouthfeel. Such a balanced and rich experience really make me glad to have cellared a decent amount yearly. Overall this comes in merely a hair below my pub experience in ’07.
2010-2011 batches, via bottle. This is where I stopped updating my notes. Time to sit back and enjoy. Other than Dark Lord, I’ve never kept notes for various vintages of the same beer, but I’m glad I did. I’ve shifted gears at this point, now that the price has crept up to $12.99+/bomber. I’ll buy one or two each year, usually on the trip back home for the holidays, but mainly I wait until I can get a fresh pour somewhere. This is easily one of my Top 5 beers and I’ll be darned if consolidating my notes hasn’t tempted me into a cellar raid for my only 2012 bottle. 3,509 charactersjake65, Sep 15, 2013

Poured into an Elysian snifter. Pours a very dark brown, appearing black in the glass; a half finger brown head with good retention and lacing.. Rich aroma of dark toasted malt, vanilla, chocolate, hints of dark dried fruit, a bit of ethanol. Flavor of toasted, lightly charred malt and charred coffee, vanilla, oak, dark dried fruit and dark cherry, finishing with chocolate and more charred malt, coffee and wood. Nice heavy body, comparable to a quality oatmeal stout. One of the world's great stouts, complex and flavorful. This vintage seems to have more char flavor than earlier ones, but there is enough hear to support it well. The alcohol noticed in the aroma is well covered in the taste by the other flavors. One of the earliest beer I ever wrote a review for, but it was not up to BA standards, simply "Ecstasy, best beer I've ever had." I have had some wonderful beer since then, but that is still not a bad succinct summary. 1,070 charactersLiquidAmber, Sep 13, 2013

One of my favorites here, perfectly balanced huge stout. Slow drinker.
VERY dark, not too much carbonation, chocolatey brown head. Smells the way I believe a stout should.
Mild coffee / bourbon flavors, with a tiny hint of what I associate with anise.
I buy the max whenever I see this beer, and usually keep one for drinking THAT NIGHT, and the rest for the cellar...have several 2012s in there right now. 424 characterssteenkampa, Aug 08, 2013

A - Deep brown/black, 1/2 finger of gorgeous medium brown head, dissipates quickly.
S - Chocolate, bourbon, raisin, fig, date, caramelized sugar, cinnamon, vanilla, burnt oak, black cherry, hint of licorice.
T - Wow. Raisin, bourbon, chocolate, alcohol, oakiness, brown sugar, molasses, and a hint of licorice.
M - Like silky smooth fluffy chewy goodness. Doesn't get much better than this. Still really well carbonated after 3 years.
O - Has aged incredibly well. Seems to be more complex than when fresh, but the alcohol is still quite prominent. Maybe give yet another year to cool down even more. 655 charactersLaneMeyer, Aug 08, 2013

A: Pitch black with some brown head that dissipated to the rim. Typical stout appearance.
S: Very rich smell of chocolate, coffee and roasted malts.
T: Very similar to the nose. Lots of chocolate with coffee, roasted malt and molasses. The bourbon is very subtle but hanging around in the background.
M: Full bodied with the right amount of carbonation. Incredibly smooth.
O: This definitely lived up to the expectation for me. It was everything I had wanted it to be. Definitely worth seeking out. 699 charactersRinkor16, Jul 31, 2013

3.96/5  rDev -11.6%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.75Thanks to Kevin R for this long time want, 2011 vintage. The abyss pours out like... an abyss. Seriously, it is black, oily, and inky as hell with a deep, deep tan head that froths up slowly like a crema on top of an overpriced espresso. Long lasting, as it slowly recedes but never fully goes away; truly a beautiful beer, and one of the darkest stouts I've seen.
Creamy and roasty coffee beans up front in the aroma. Very "nice" coffee, like the kind you get at one of those indie shops with the hipster, tattooed barista, none of that Meijer aisle 9 shit. Not as good as, say, Speedway, but still a nice coffee blend. There's an underlying sweetness, a la cream and sugar-y, with a bit of back-end mild smoke. 
Roasted malts, cocoa, and black licorice make a small appearance; enough to be noticeable, but they really don't leave a lasting impression. I wanna say molasses is somewhere in there, too, but it could just be a conjugate of the overall sweetness and maybe I'm just reaching for some descriptors now. Abyss is coffee, all day; it smells good but isn't exactly that complex.
The flavor leads off like the aroma, like taking a sip of something that's been sitting on top of coffee beans for months. Oily, roasted coffee beans, again, followed up with a balancing sweetness that goes hand in hand with the creamy body of the beer. Abyss has a nice mouth feel; smooth and heavy with pretty damn good carbonation.
Roasted beans and roasted malt keeps pounding the flavor profile. Maybe a little bit of licorice here and some molasses there. But it's not layered quite like I was expecting. And I've made it through nearly the entire glass with basically no mention of barrel. Seriously - I know it's only 33% barrel-aged or whatever, but it does not show up in this beer, at all. Perhaps that's why the complexity suffers.
Here's my problem with Abyss. It's a great stout, really. If I could go pick this off the shelf anytime for about 8-9$ a bomber, I gladly would. I just don't see why people go bat-shit nuts over this beer. I don't understand the 4.55 cumulative average (at this time of rating) for this beer. It's good, but c'mon people, it's not *that* good, and I certainly would never go through the hassle of trading just to get it. When it starts seeing year-round distro, then maybe I'll buy some more. 2,330 characterstectactoe, Jul 21, 2013

A: Pours near pitch black. Sits like a black hole in the glass with a rich, creamy mocha head. 
S: Incredibly rich and robust. A lot of layers and very complex. Rich dark chocolate, anise, espresso, some vinous grape skin, some oaky vanilla and vanilla bean. The natural chocolate and coffee are enhanced greatly by all the barrel aging and other ingredients. 
T: Substantially bitter - dark chocolate, anise, heavily roasted coffee beans, and ash. The vanilla is more subtle than in the nose but still noticeable and rounds out some of the bitterness. The barrel aging components come through very subtly, most prominent is the wine, get little to no bourbon.
P: Medium and incredibly smooth. Very soft carbonation. Leaves a layer of ashy roasty film on the mouth. 
O: The extravagant recipe yields an enhanced RIS that's balanced perfectly. Coming into it I thought it was going to be over the top and was curious about the purpose of the very specific and considerably minute aging, but it worked very well. A fantastic beer 1,047 characterstimc100, Jul 13, 2013

poured from a 22oz bottle into a 3FFF glass 
pour pretty dark very little head if any and no lacing
smell is damn right amazing this aged perfectly heavy chocolate, toffee
taste was upfront heavy chocolate and so smooth could drink this all day 
on the back end i get some toffee and slight touch of anise but the chocolate is overwhelming 
I definitely recommend putting some age on these in my opinion about 2-3 years in seem they are ripe and ready to go 532 charactersmhksuccess, Jun 24, 2013

4.43/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Tried a bottle of the 2011 reserve. Pour black as night with nice tan head. The lace is much better than most stouts. 
The smell is very interesting. The first whiff is a sweet dark chocolate smell that I guess is the molasses coming through first. As the beer sits I pick up a little bit of a tart smell which I guess is the wine barrel aging. There is definitely a lot going on here. 
The taste is great. Smooth as smooth gets. Nice sweet taste upfront. One major knock on it is that the warmer it gets the more bitter it becomes. Not bad but just not as good as when its a bit cooler which is the opposite of the others in this category. 
Overall, very good but not outstanding. Would love to try again. 709 characterssjones5045, Jun 21, 2013

Beer is jet black with a large tan head. Good retention, decent lace. 
Smell is big and very nice. Lots of chocolate and molasses. Some caramel. Vanilla and some oak. Really smells inviting. 
Taste is similar to the nose. Chocolate, molasses, oak, vanilla. Some bourbon. The wine barrel effect is there, but I don't think I could have identified it without looking for it. Lots going on here, and it works very well. Yum!
Full bodied, moderately carbonated. Smooth. Feels good.
Overall, terrific. The praise is well deserved. A complex and very tasty beer. 631 charactersjrenihan, Jun 21, 2013

S - Dark chocolate, coffee, and booze. Lots of roared and smokey aromas. 
T - Very smooth. Didn't encounter any of the booze that I was picking up on in the aroma. A little peppery spice hits the tongue and then comes in the dark chocolate. A little smoke and pretty aggressive malts in the after taste.
M - Very heavy and stays on the palette long after your last sip. No carbonation to speak of. Very nice.
O - Really amazing brew and so honored to have scored it on tap. Lived up to the hype and would gladly buy another. Would really love to have an aged bottle. 677 charactersThePaleRider, May 31, 2013

4.4/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Notes are from a few months ago, a bottle shared at The Attic.
Viscous and thick and a heavy, heavy pitch black, it truly does seem like I'm peering into the Abyss. It's just plain beastly-looking. The brown head has a good deal of the thickness found in the body of this stout, though it doesn't sit quite as tall or as thick as the impressive heft would dictate. That said, the head shows great retention and clings very nicely to the glass in some heavy patching.
The aroma gives a hint of deliciousness to come. The balance of sweetness with the lightly charred edge and a big oaky presence is impressive. Roast (of course) and coffee mingle with the caramel, toffee, molasses, cocoa and vanilla and a note almost black licorice make up the sweetness. It's not as strong or deep as I hope the flavor to be, but very good nonetheless.
The flavor doesn't disappoint. The roast and coffee bring up some bitterness and there's a char to it that can add an element of depth and deliciousness only if it can be tamed, and it is. All the big sweetness in the aroma comes out even more deeply and dances in synch. The wood adds a further balancing dryness and bit of flavor itself without going overboard. All of this just balances so well.
The feel is exceptionally thick and weighty in a big, big body with exceptional creamy smoothness. It does sit heavy, though. Alcohol seems to thin the finish just a touch, but not too much. 1,428 charactersBrenden, May 29, 2013

A- Pours black, has a decent head on it, tan lacing.
S- Aroma is very sweet. Coffee, molasses, chocolate, and malt are the main flavors I get. A little bit of caramel as well.
T- Initial sip I get a lot of bitter dark chocolate. The flavor is very sweet, like the aroma. It has a good amount of barrel character, nice amount of oak. Coffee, caramel, lots of burnt notes. Again, very sweet, not too sweet though.
M- Medium body, as expected with The Abyss. I traditionally prefer stouts thicker, but for what it is it drinks very well. Could use some more carbonation, its fallen off a bit.
O- The Abyss is always a solid stout, though for the life of me I don't understand why it's one of the highest rated beers on this entire site. I've had it fresh and aged, several times. It always drinks well and has a good amount of flavors but I always feel like it lacks something. As I said it's solid, but it never blows me away. 943 charactersAhappyhiker2, May 20, 2013

Appearance - Black, thick, and impenetrable by light with a 1 inch beige head that hangs around for a good 10 minutes.
Smell - Chocolate, licorice, and coffee with a hint of bourbon. The smell of this beer is beyond complex - lovely sweetness and maltiness underneath everything. 
Taste - Oh the taste - I swear I heard angel wings flapping as I savored it. So complex and balanced without a hint of booziness. Sweet on the tongue with everything you want in a barrel aged stout - chocolate, coffee, bourbon, and a nice bitter finish
Mouthfeel - So silky with just the right amount of carbonation. Oily and thick - this is what I expect from a huge stout. 
Overall: my favorite stout that I have ever drank, replacing KBS. It's so well done and complex! I can't wait to taste my other one after it ages! 896 charactersdouginromeo, May 19, 2013

4.79/5  rDev +6.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Poured from bottle into glass , deep rich super black beer with a beautiful 3 finger deep tan colored head and lacing that sticks to the glass and holds its place all the way through the glass. One damn fine looking brew
 Smell is rich and earthy , the dark malt flavors just blow you away with a sweetness to it that makes your mouth water and just makes you want to take a drink
 A well balanced flavor , the dark malts hit you with a hint of chocolate and the bitterness of the hops jumping in pretty fast and riding through the drink , the alcohol is well hidden and pops up at the very end. So many complex flavors that just mix together well but each making its own way on the tounge , just wonderful and just sweet enough to let you know what it is
 Such a mouth on this beer , each sip feels like you took a gulp , the carbonation is to the perfect level to offset such a heavy brew , well done
Overall for me this is the beer that should set the var for all other Imperial Stouts to try and reach. Its complex , its unique and just one damn tasty brew 1,064 charactersubenumber2, May 15, 2013

Smell: The aromas definitely give out hints of sweet roasted coffee, dark chocolate, roasted malts, dark fruit and molasses. 
Taste: Like the aromas, it has some sweet roasted coffee along with bitter dark chocolate, roasted malts, molasses, faint dark fruit, some woody oak, some licorice and maybe a touch of vanilla. 
Mouthfeel: It has a low/med carbonation with a very nice overall balance and feel. 
Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with great flavors and aromas. 642 charactersSebD, May 14, 2013

Served in a 10 oz snifter, this beer has the typical Abyss look, we know why they call it Abyss, with a half inch of brown head without much stickiness, decent lacing. 2011 smells a lot like Obsidian but much richer and deeper in its dark heavy roasted barley malt. Slightly burnt. Not hoppy, yeasty or hot.
Taste is like the aroma with its dark rich malt that is heavily roasted with just a hint of acrid bite in the finish. All malt. Notes of dark chocolate and anise prominent.
Viscosity is lower than many of its peers yet this beer is completely devoid of alcohol bite which makes this beast way too drinkable. A couple bottles of this goes down easy...although it will set you back a few bucks. Smooth, carbonation seems right for this beer.
Overall, I've enjoyed this beer over the years with some seeming to be better than others although it's probably me and when I've tasted vs. variability from year to year as I assume it's the same recipe. A big stout that is quite tasty and could pass for a 8% ABV beer. Would like it if it was a little more affordable and easier to get but one of those special beers you wait all year for. 1,356 charactersdeebo, May 14, 2013

4.38/5  rDev -2.2%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Bit of a back story; this is my second time trying this beer. First was the bottle I brought to 2012 Darkness Day to share amongst some new BA friends. It was getting late in the night and our table had already gone through many a fine bottle. My Abyss was opened and passed around, I got my pour then passed it to a very nice, but very drunk new friend who proceded to drop the halfful bottle onto the concrete. Beer abuse or a sacrifice to the beer gods? I believe the later. It was an epic night. So this one's for you Cumsalt, you know who you are!
2011 vintage poured into my favorite snifter.
Pours like old ass motor oil. Seriously the darkest beer I've ever seen. No light shines through even on the rim when held to light. Surprisingly nice two finger head that actually stuck around for a bit and left behind some lacing. Wow.
Classic roasty notes. Getting some of the molasses and anise. Hints of barrel juice and a bit of red wine. Very little alcohol. Well balanced for how much seems to be going on.
Starts of like your typical imp. stout. Tons of roasted malt and dark chocolate. Not as sweet as I expected. Barrel comes through in the middle, not so much bourbon but more oak and tobacco. Surprising amount of red wine flavors come through here. Finishes pretty bitter, like pure cocoa powde. Lingering finish with more tobacco.
Oddly high amount of carbonation for the style. Maybe a bit too much initially, but after a few swirls it calms down nicely. Heavy in body, but more modest for the style. Doesn't coat the mouth as much as some. 
Overall, this is an impeccably well crafted and one of a kind beer. Not like any other stout I've had, and I've tried most of the famous big stouts. This may be the most complex of the big stouts I've had. There is so much going on, it's a wonder it works at all. I think the partial wine barrel aging is what brings this to that next level. With that said, this isn't my favorite. I prefer a more simple, straight bourbon aged stout. This also finishes a bit too bitter for me and the mouthfeel is a little light. This is a great beer though, and one that I will always buy a couple of every year. Worth the hype. Cheers! 2,185 charactersHumulus85, May 04, 2013

L: Pitch black with a creamy mocha colored head, excellent retention for a beer of this strength. Great lacing as well.
A: Deep chocolate/coffee roasted notes, sweet cookie malt, vanilla, licorice, cherry, touch of bourbon, noticeable alcohol.
T/M: Firm coffee bitterness upfront, moves into chocolate malt, bittersweet vanilla, licorice, woody cherry, slight coconut. Hop spice is present in the middle, but not at the forefront. The back reveals some more dark fruit and cherry, and has a long, lingering roasted coffee/chocolate aftertaste. The mouthfeel is very smooth, but surprisingly light, leading to a very drinkable beer considering the strength.
Overall, one of the most complex and well balance Imperial Stouts I have ever had. Huge, rich flavor and an intoxicating aroma, not to mention it's gorgeous appearance. A world class beer fresh, can't wait to put some age on a couple bottles. 916 charactersSiriusfisherman, Apr 30, 2013

A- Pours a chocolate colored body that's transparent on the pour but opaque once in the glass. The head is mocha colored and rises to about 1.5 fingers before slowly reducing to a thin layer of brown foam. Leaves blotchy lacing. 
S- The stout characteristics are light on the nose with toffee, coffee beans, and milk chocolate coming in a little. The oak is definitely present and dominates here - fresh oak with a slight fruityness to it - is that from the cherry bark or the wine barrel? I'm not sure. What I do know is that it's unique and inviting. Vanilla and bourbon sneak through but you really have to strain for them.
T- Upfront I get a big flavorful punch of bittersweet chocolate, vanilla, toffee and molasses. This eventually develops into a dark fruit, almost tart woody note that is was definitely brought on by the wine barrels. The bourbon and oak characteristics definitely show themselves on the follow through - vanilla-caramel brought on by the bourbon and a fresh wood flavor mesh with the other flavors to really make this beer complex. The finish has that PERFECT lingering roastyness that I get in all world-class BA stouts. It lingers for at least a minute afterwards (reminiscent almost of burnt toast, but in a savory delicious way).
M- Medium body, but this does not at all take away from the experience. It doesn't have the motor-oil consistency of BCBS, but it's not TOO thin. Low carbonation.
After finishing this bottle, I can really see why it sits at the top of the top 250 list. The complexity of this beer is unmatched by any other russian imperial stout I've ever tasted, and that's really the shining point of this brew. It's not simply a BA stout, or vanilla RIS. It's a world class blend that is like none other. A must try. 1,848 charactersgcamparone, Apr 23, 2013

Review is from my notes. This is a review of the 2011 vintage. Bottle lists it as "best after 08/04/12." Consumed on "03/13/13." Poured out of a 22oz bottle into a teku glass.
The Abyss definitely lives up to its name in terms of appearance: a complete opaque blackness with an off mocha head on top, and no light going through this thing whatsoever. Looks extremely viscous and thickened to the most ridiculous degree an imperial stout can be taken, and almost looks like a coffee liqueur as a result. Tons of lacing graces the walls of the glass, and the half finger head lasts almost entirely throughout. Pretty much near perfection all around.
The aroma is chock-filled with all kinds of spices and flavors that are integrated heavily at this point, but definitely in ways that are utterly over the top. Underneath an initial whiff of faded mint, there's strong anise notes, vanilla soaked chocolate, tons of oak, a boozy backdrop that resembles candied dark fruits, vinous characteristics imparted by the Pinot Noir barrel aging, and zesty, deep roasted espresso bean flavors. This is unbelievably complex, and while I could do without the alcoholic sting and a lot of the licorice, it's quite fabulous and unique overall. Aging has done wonders to this thing for sure.
One sip reveals (to me at least) why this beer has become so romanticized as one of the country's most exceptional beers. For starters, all of the stinging sensations imparted by the ABV are completely (and I mean *completely*) hidden here! It adds some sweetness to the overall profile here, which consists of roasted woody malt juiciness with vanilla cream, herbal and floral qualities (the hops are faded at this point), and a spectacular dark chocolate finish that is satisfying and decadent overall. There's some light coffee, as well as anise, but the star here is definitely woody properties that have melded so beautifully with the chocolate and vanilla flavors. Fruits abound, such as dark cherries and blueberries, but it's very subtle. Carbonation is lively and phenomenally present, which accentuates these flavors. There's no cloying sensation caused by any sweetness or excessive hops or booze. Balance is key here, while still showcasing all of the various degrees of complexity within.
Holy crap, I love this beer. Well, this vintage, at least. Aged this long, it's one of my new favorite things, and one of the most exceptional stouts I've had of its kind - if not THE most exceptional, period! It's definitely one of those beers over $15 that is worth every penny spent, and investing in a few to cellar is a must. This is a true testament to everything that makes me love craft beer so much at its best: an ambitious recipe, heart and soul poured into the product, a dizzying array of flavors, and yet, in the end, a drinkable product that never overwhelms but rather adds on to the senses. Incredible stuff. Lives up to every bit of hype. I hope other vintages I find of the Abyss age this well.
OTHER VINTAGE REVIEWS:
2010 (1/5/2013): Cracked this open the other night. This has already peaked way beyond this beer's aging potential. A phenomenal nose as always, with dusty oak notes, dark fruits, and chocolate syrup, but the flavor falls flat as a one dimensional cocoa forward imperial stout with a woody finish and not much else. Soy saucy at first, but mellows out a bit more over time. Still underwhelming - I wish I could have tried this vintage at its best. 3.75. 3,587 charactersmagictacosinus, Apr 21, 2013

Appearance: Opaque black, one finger head of tan head which, to my surprise, dissipated rather quickly
Nose: Dark roasted coffee, anise, somewhat oaky, dark cocoa. Very intense dark and almost smoky aromas. Slight vanilla note peaks out at you once you swirl.
Taste: COFFEE! Black bitter coffee. Just huge coffee on the front which was almost all I could taste in the first mouth full of it, then it finished with lingering dark chocolate. One the second mouth full (after the palate annihilator) I tasted more of the roasty, toasty malt and sweetness of molasses. A little bit of the vanilla and anise I got in the nose came out, but very subtle.
Mouthfeel: Feels like it looks. Smooth, rich, and velvety. Almost chewy.
Overall a beautifully brewed Imperial Stout. I would definitely drink again given the opportunity. I would love to see what this would do after a year or two in the bottle. Well done Deschutes :) 1,026 charactersAHood, Apr 18, 2013

4.62/5  rDev +3.1%look: 5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Deschutes The Abyss 2012. Dated "best after 11/01/13". 22oz bomber poured into snifter glass. 11.1% ABV.
Appearance: Motor oil black. Chocolately tan head
Aroma: Black liquorice, oaky effervescence, chocolate, vanilla, roasted malts
Taste & Mouthfeel: Smooth, creamy, an almost peanut butter like aftertaste. Medium-Low carbonation. Full-bodied and thick on the tongue. Very malty with a slightly spicy kick at the finish. The wood is very noticeable and creates subtle nuances in the flavors similar to the aroma. 
Overall: Fairly tasty, but Deschutes is definitely right for stamping each bottle with a "best after" date to signify this beer should be aged before being drank. Luckily, I have two more bottles of this so we'll see how it develops over the next few years! Cheers! 785 charactersClonies720, Apr 12, 2013

A: Small head, never fully dissipates, jet black in color, smooth velvety viscosity. 
S: Nose is cocoa, coffee, anise, booze
T: Palate is huge molasses, boozy, grainy toast, hop astringency. Almost tastes like straight molasses with beer flavors added for accent. Nice oaky smoothness around the edges, keeping booze in check, although there is plenty toward the back of the sip.  Finishes long and sweet. 
M: Chewy and viscous...sticks to every corner of your mouth, in a good way. 
This is kind of a classic for me, a go-to decadent stout befor the whole barrel-aged craze took off. This and Speedway, of course. 658 charactersrand, Apr 08, 2013

Pours midnight black with a half finger of khaki foam, absolutely no transparency anywhere. No visible carbonation, good legs and lacing. 
Smells of french oak, coffee, chocolate, bourbon, butterscotch, molasses, wine, hops, toffee, vanilla, cherry and other dark fruits, alcohol, banana, a mild malt. Very rich and layered, quite complex. I could sniff this stuff all day 
Taste follows the nose very well- up front roast coffee malts, hints of vanilla, oak, molasses and brown sugar, butter scotch, toffee, bourbon, figs, a touch of alcohol, and a strong chocolate and cherry after taste. Like the aroma, there's a ton going on here
The feel is full bodied and thick, chewy and creamy. It's upfront pretty bitter, but has a finish that ends pretty strongly on the sweet side. The alcohol is almost undetectable, impressive for how much there is after only about six months. After taste of that chocolate and cherry lingers for quite a while, really good 
Overall this stuff is incredible. If it's this good thus far, it's hard to imagine how it will improve after the best after date. Well worth the hype 1,134 characterslordofstarside, Mar 30, 2013

4.77/5  rDev +6.5%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75I have two bottles of the Deschutes Abyss 2012. One I am trying now, the other I will age for a year. It's an Imperial Stout that is aged in French oak and bourbon barrels. 11% ABV, and it's about 48°F. 
Right off the bat, you pick up on the vanilla and bourbons notes with a little bit of dark chocolate and roasted malt lingering on the finish. Full body, almost syrupy, like molasses. I do think I pick up on a faint whisper of anise. A lot of depth comes out and completes the finish with a espresso taste, but I swear it has some personality like wine with the oaky characteristics and some dark fruits.
The carbonation is low, which you expect with an Imperial Stout. She's balanced and has a velvety, smooth finish. 65 IBU's make this a world class Imperial Stout in my opinion. 
This would go great with a freshly grounded beef burger with grilled onions and swiss cheese. Can't wait to taste it in a year. 918 charactersdarthhamby, Mar 30, 2013

Big thanks to Rutager for this long time want.
Poured from a bomber, best after 8/4/12.
Appearance: Huge dark brown head that doesn't fill the glass too much but enough to make it eye-catching. Body id real dark, almost black. Head slowly cascades and nice hanging lacing is left as the glass empties itself.
Smell: Lots of cocoa, some vanilla, oak soaked, bit of chocolate.
Taste: Milky coffee, cocoa nibs, strong oak presence but not overbearing, charcoal, strong vanilla, cork in the aftertaste, bit of black licorice, wine-like oak backbone.
Mouthfeel: Ultra smooth & creamy, very low carbonation, velvety, easy to drink, balanced.
Overall: Flavors are various but they all fit without crowding each other. One of my favorites in recent memory. I'd have a cellar full of this! 808 characterspapat444, Mar 25, 2013

Pours a beautiful dark brown almost black. Good finger and a half head that settled to a thin lacing. Very nice for an almost 2 year old bottle. Smells of coffee, chocolate and what I can only call deliciousness. This is truly a delight even before taking a sip. 
Tastes of chocolate, coffee and oakey notes I assume from barrels. A good amount of coffee bitterness is still present and balances out the tastes perfectly. This bottle has aged very well.
I normally wouldn't review a beer that I had only at a tasting but its Abyss and I sort of hoarded it and drank a bit more than the typical tasting amount, nobody seemed to mind. 802 charactersjbeezification, Mar 16, 2013

Bomber bottle cellared from the 2007 edition (2007 - Released January 2008) 
*A: Dark, some slight brown, thick, slight carbonation, very nice lacing-long legs, some slight tannish head (so carbo has stayed even though it's a 2007).
*S: Licorice, smoky, peaty, some coffee, some hops as it warmed up near the end.
*T: Mmmmm mmm good. Classic high-end double or Russian Imperial taste. Fairly strong black licorice, coffee bitterness in the finish, molasses and oak. Very high level representation of the category and complex flavor characteristics that are multi-level. From initial pour to the last few warm drops in the glass, it slightly changed and opened up.
*M: Creamy but with some carbonation to keep it interesting. Not the thickest, but it coats the tongue and has a long pronounced finish (mostly coffee). No alcohol burn, it's hidden.
OVERALL: Great stout, wonderful it is "American" but wish it was from the east coast. Tough to get here. It hit on all the classic, key marks it needed to. Not a lot of bourbon, but enough of it to add to the experience and not overwhelm the experience. 1,197 charactersSHerninko, Mar 15, 2013

The aroma is top notch coming strongly from the tulip glass. Big coffee notes with vanilla, tart fruit, black licorice and subtle traces of bourbony goodness. The taste is complex with coffee, chocolate mousse, and sweet rock candy up front followed by oaky vanilla, graham cracker and a little heat from the bourbon. There’s beautiful bubbly lacing hanging about the glass. The palate offers a slightly syrupy texture with a good bit of carbonation to balance it.

Interesting thing is am getting a nice bitterness at the end that may be because this beer being aged in Oak Wine barrels. There is a lot going on with this beer. Mouthfeel is nice with just some slight carbonation.

Pours a deep dark black ale with a frothing, creamy dark beige head for miles. At least 3 finger high. Impressive for being aged a few years. Nice lacing throughout session.
Getting huge aroma whiffs. Black licorice is abundant. Burnt/charred wood. Dark roasted malts. Warming bourbon. Big molasses. Leather. Rawhide.
The taste is amazing. Dark chocolate with a touch of heat on each sip. Bourbon character is nicely represented. Warming tummy after each sip. Black coffee hints. Still hoppy as well. Big flavor on the swallow. Leaves the oak/leather/wood combo salivating on the buds. Really well done.
Mouthfeel is slick as an oil spill. Full bodied meal in your mouth.
Overall this is worth the hype and the search to find it. Roughly $12 a bomber is worth the price for this ride. Follow the instructions on the label re: consumption and you are in for a treat. Also look at the 11% abv cuz this baby likes to creep. 977 characterskaseydad, Mar 09, 2013

5/5  rDev +11.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Pours opaque black with a billowy tan head. The nose is coffee, chocolate liqueur, licorice, vanilla, chestnut, and bourbon. The flavor is almost as complex as the aroma with the bourbon, and Merlot being more muted than I expected, but not in a "they’re almost undetectable" sort of way. Rather, those flavors serve as underpinnings (in an almost catalyst-likemanner) that bring out the intensity of the more obvious esters like bitter chocolate, roast coffee, vanilla, licorice, toffee, chestnut, salt, and almost a smoky bacon quality. At first I thought the body was a tad thin to support such a dynamic flavor profile, but then I realized that if it were thicker, it would make the flavor almost too mouth coating and intense to be as drinkable as it is. I agree with the other reviewers who think this beer will be an aging marvel, but for me it is already an absolutely ideal imperial stout, which I find even more rounded and complex than Speedway, and even more remarkable for achieving its decidedly coffeeish flavor component without the actual addition of that ingredient. The finish is incredibly long, and the balance is wondrous for such a big brew. Wow! 1,171 charactersImpfan, Mar 03, 2013

a: thick & black, like used motor oil pouring out of the bottle. a fingers worth of mocha colored head raised up from the depths of the bottom of the bottle. there is more sticky spider web like lacing in the glass than I have ever seen from a beer before.
s: rich and sweet molasses is the first thing, reminds me of baked beans (wonder why). unfortunately the licorice kind of ruins the smell for me. vanilla and wine barrels save it for me. don't know why but I don't pick up on the bourbon barrel aspect of this any.
t: very sweet. rich molasses and licorice dominate but blend well together. once again not picking up on the bourbon barrel. wish i could detect more of the cherry wood in the flavor.
m: thick and sticky with good carbonation. get some warming from the alochol on the finish, but it's hidden nicely. finishes warm and sticky.
o: very good beer that I'm glad I had the chance to try, but not one that I will seek out every year. 966 charactersmatch1112, Feb 26, 2013

Definitely living up to its name, the beer was black and quite opaque and a very dark brown head. It smelled like dark chocolate with a bit of coffee and nuts. Incredibly thick and the most velvety smooth beer I've ever had out of a bottle. I could taste alcohol, but just barely. Nicely carbonated. I think the aging mellowed it, as I had it again on tap this year and the carbonation and roasted flavors were much more intense and biting. It deserves to be aged. 567 charactersfalc0n2600, Feb 26, 2013

A: Dark Black with a tiny rim of dark brown head. .
S: Baker's chocolate, wood, and very dark roasted malts stick out right away. Some dark fruit as it warms. Very Nice. 
T: Dark chocolate and deep, dark malts from the beginning. Somewhat nutty and cherry flavors mix well with the wood/oak character. Blends very well together. 
M: Velvet smoothness, thick, and carbonation is very soft. 
O: One of the best I've had for this style. Really glad I got to try it on tap. 537 charactersDowney_george, Feb 20, 2013

2009 Reserve edition. Best after: 11/1/2010 printed in the left side of the label.
A: Pours a deep brown to black color forming a absolutely beautiful creamy and thin bubbled beige to brow head. Multi tonalities of brown lacings are formed on the top. Excellent retention and only small spotty lacings left in the glass. A thin layer remains forever on the top
S: Very sweet and malty upfront. Strong notes of wood, dark chocolate and coffee. Strong notes of dark fruits, mix of grapes, raisins and figs, mainly. Licorice and caramel. Roasted malts and a some notes of alcohol in the end
T: Perfect taste. Sweet upfront with strong notes of coffee, dark chocolate, licorice, roasted malts, caramel, caramel malts, oak, grapes, raisins, figs, smoked malts... End is bitter but not extremely. Bitterness is mainly made of roasted malts than hops
M: Heavy body. Creamy and molasses. Medium to low carbonation. Roasted malts bitter aftertaste

Poured into a tulip glass black with a one finger tan head. Low retention and minimal lacing. The scent is strong of chocolate with a hint of oak. Where's the bourbon? Despite it being a 2010 vintage, alcohol is still strong in the scent. The taste is is chocolate goodness, very sweet. The licorice is faint, which is fine by me (I hate licorice). But again, where's the bourbon? There is alot of alcohol warmth with this, which might be the bourbon, but I'm missing the flavor for some reason. The body is good and thick.
I've got more vintages in my "texas cellar" (back of the fridge), so I'll have to add those over the next couple years. 658 characterswhoneeds8, Feb 16, 2013

Appearance: Pours a deep brown and leaves very little head. The name seems to be accurately picked based on the pour.
Smell: Chocolate, figs, some coffee, plums, fire/smoke. Very interesting aroma - I can tell that this one will change a lot as it ages.
Taste: Dark chocolate, molasses, some vanilla, as well as some figs and plums. Very interesting, and different from other barrel aged brews I've had. A hint of cherry in there as well which is great.
Mouth-feel: Quite thick, but the carbonation is evident. Quite nice to chew around a bit to feel out all the flavors. Quite complex.
Overall: This is a very interesting brew. As I said earlier, I can tell this one will definitely change with age. It is very enjoyable right now though - so many flavors in this one. It has a nice smokiness to it that really makes it stand out from other barrel aged stouts. This is a classic and I recommend it to all. 1,066 charactersResuin, Feb 15, 2013

A: Pours pitch back with one full finger of fluffy mocha latte colored head. The foam takes awhile to settles, and there is a serious amount of lacing left on the class as it drinks. This beer also has some nice legs.
S: The nose is milk chocolate, dark chocolate, cream, licorice, and burnt toast. It smells excellent. 
T: It starts out creamy and sweet with the chocolate notes coming on strong first. Some of the burnt toast aspects filter into the middle as the beer gets a bit more bitter. The sweetness returns a bit in the finish, where is mixes very well with the bitters.
M: Full bodied beer. Sweet and coating to start, coating and bitter in the middle, and it has a mix mix of each in the finish. It's smooth, creamy, and dangerously easy to drink.
O: This is a phenomenal beer. One of my favorites for the style. I look forward to having a few of these each year. 932 characterstrxxpaxxs, Feb 13, 2013

A: 5/5 Pours black. Blacker than black. A terminus of all light, as not one single photon passes through with a glorious crown the hue of mud. Utterly beautiful and inviting.
S: 4.75/5 Nose is complex and decadent. Roasted malt, vanilla, licorice, cherry, chocolate , oak. Layered and balanced in perfect equilibrium. Inviting. Not quite as much vanilla or barrel character as I would have liked, but the nose is glorious nonetheless.
T: 4.75/5. Chocolate. Cherry. Molasses. Tart red wine. Flavor after flavor mixes and melds it's way into the palate. Complex and delicious. Oak, vanilla, licorice, a touch of alcohol and bitter dark roast coffee give way to a finish and aftertaste of chocolate, red wine, alcohol and dark coffee. Again, lacking in bourbon character, which is not surprising since only 6% is bourbon barrel aged, but necessary for a perfect score in my book.  Delicious. Nearly perfect.
M: 5/5 Full bodied and silky/creamy smooth. Some alcohol astringency marres what is otherwise the perfect imperial stout mouthfeel, until it's warmer. When it warmer it has no taste or feel of alcohol.
O: 5/5 Not perfect, not the nectar of the gods, but closer to perfection than 4.5. Vanilla and chocolate become more prominent as it warms and stretches for perfection. A true beast of an imperial stout, that could be perfect if it were aged for a year or two in 100% bourbon barrels or a mix of bourbon and rye, but the wine barrel lend an unwelcome tartness to the abyss. I will absolutely try this beer again. It's utterly delicious and among the best beers I've ever had to date (it was number 666 for me). 99/100 1,704 charactersBierJager89, Feb 10, 2013

A: Beautiful pitch black beer with a nice mocha head that leaves amazing lacing.

T: Disappointing. Very bitter chocolate and licorice. Kinda bland to be honest. 
M: Thin/medium bodied. Thinner than I expected for sure. Dry finish. Leaves a weird film in the mouth and bitterness stays lingering for so long. Feeling reminds me of my mouth as I leave the dentist. Not pleasant. 
O: This was a disappointing beer. Smells good, tastes alright but the mouthfeel just makes it a mess. Surprising because this has been properly cellared at 55 degrees since purchased. Given the high praise though I'll give the benefit of the doubt. I'd definitely be willing to try it again to see if it was just a bad bottle. 872 charactersstandardcherry, Feb 02, 2013

A - wow, big black pour from the bottle to the glass. Very little translucency even on the periphery. HUGE head on the semi-forced pour, almost half the glass, incredibly viscous. The foam is dark brown and recedes quickly. Very nice.
S - from the glass, honestly, all I get is sweet malts. Surprisingly empty. However, I give a 4 because, as I was pouring it, even though my face was more than a foot away, I picked up some of the wine and oak notes that the front of the bottle boasts. 
T - incredibly disappointing. I get very little of the malts and almost a full on blast of the fruity bitters. This is unlike any other stout I've ever had, but not in a good way. Super bitter and stale. I should've waited to open this as instructed on the bottle!!!
M - blech. The bitterness clings to the cheeks relentlessly. The alcohol content is too substantial, even at 11%. There is a little redemption in the creamy texture.
O - a huge disappointment, but it's my own damn fault. I really should have waited at least a year...at least I have another one to age. 1,201 charactersJamesShoemaker, Jan 29, 2013

Pours a rich molasses color, with a creamy tan head that recedes down to some light bubbles. 
Aromas of wine and cocoa. Some coffee and dark chocolate as well. 
Big bold heavy flavor. Chocolate and wine. Interesting and enhanced by the silky creamy texture. Dry heavy alcohol, metallic aftertaste. Texture is very good. One to savor for sure. Great beer. The aftertaste is slightly offputting to me but not so much that it ruins it. This kind of reminds of a valentines day type beer, with the chocolate and wine. 569 charactersBraz, Jan 28, 2013

Appearance: Pours jet black. Thin to be expected for a beer with some age on it. 
Smell: Bourbon!!! Molasses, dark fig. Lots of Bourbon. 
Taste: Bourbon again, sweet, almost to cloying, Licorice and some dark candy.
Mouth feel: Viscous a little thin and a little hot. The thinness is to be expected with some age so it's not too much of a turn off.
Overall: Good but not integrated enough. A bit too sweet and bourbon heavy. I should add a foot note that I prefer non BA beers to BA versions, but this one is sooo Bourbon Heavy it's a little off putting. Just wasn't integrated enough. 626 characterscradke, Jan 25, 2013

Served in Deschutes Tulip. 
Aroma: Coffee, Carmel, Booze
Appearance: Pours a jet black color with pretty much no head 
Flavor: The flavor felt a little roasted to me with a notch of sweetness. It just felt bland and unmemorable. 
Palate: Thick and oily
Overall Impression: I was shocked that I didn’t like this more. I’ve been wanting to try this beer for a while. I have some 2010 and 2011 Vintages that I am still excited to try and feel like this might've just needed more time to condition. I drank the bottle 10 days after the '12 release. That said, I still think this is an above average beer, but I think my expectations exceeded what I got. 668 charactersnkeckhar, Jan 23, 2013

A: Abyssmal darkness that descends into the utter void of reality. The light is banished from this infernal brew. Beautiful fluffy crown worthy an emperor. Perfect look!
S: The essential smell is cherryinfused dark chocolate. Alongside we pick up scents like butter, dark molasses, vanilla perfectly integrated with subtle earthiness. 
T: Dark fruit, plums at first and then dark chocolate, soysauce, vanilla. There's also a burnt touchdrop of coffee and at the very end a hint of some tart chewy apples. Oh, the complexity! 
M: Full, medium carbonation. Creamy. Lays gently on your tounge and whispers smoothly to your palate while creating gastronomic extasy!
O: Could this beer be better? I don't think so. It's got everything you could aske for in an imperial stout and all the tastes and smells are delicately integrated and balanced. This is the first beer I am willing to give straight A's! I went into the abyss and came back a changed man, an enlightened man. 1,076 charactersLinusBohman, Jan 23, 2013

T: Dark chocolate and deep, dark malts from the beginning. Somewhat nutty and cherry flavors mix well with the wood/oak character. Blends very well together.

I have to admit this review is a bit bias, I am somewhat new to the game of aging beers (abt 2 years) I have tried some hyped beers and I am cellaring others, other than a 2009 Stone IRS which I just opened this past christmas, this is the first hyped beer that I've had that has been aged properly, about 15 months. Pours a dense black, i've seen worse reading some of the ratings i've read, with a very thin lacing. On the nose you pick up different notes each sniff, caramel, coffee, oak, toffee, chocolate, licorice. I take my first sip and i'm done. This is one of the most smooth, complex imperial stouts i have ever tasted. I am not worthy, one of the best beers I've ever had, going to drink the rest of this in peace.

4.18/5  rDev -6.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Presentation: 2011 vintage, 'Best After 8-4-12'. This is brewed with blackstrap molasses, licorice, with cherry bark and vanilla added. 6% was aged in bourbon barrels, 11% in oak barrels, and 11% in wine barrels. Poured into two Chimay chalices to split with my wife to celebrate my 30th birthday...stepping into the abyss as it were...
Appearance: Viscous dark brown on the pour, to utter black in the goblet. Large mocha cap (surprising for the age and abv) with nice stick. 
Smell: Nose is rich dark chocolate, maybe a bit of brownie batter, dry roasted grain, a bit of generic dark red fruit, and ghost of booziness. Rich and inviting. 
Taste: Wow. As much as Dark Lord disappointed me, Abyss lives up to what I expected. It starts a dark red fruitiness and semi-sweet dark chocolate before moving onto dry, dusty burnt grains. Sweet, viscous beer, but it ends relatively dry, with a somewhat bitter bite with what might be a touch of oak tannin as well. Alcohol is present, readily perceived, but not at all hot; it's well integrated and actually adds to the enjoyment of the beer. Good stuff. 
Mouthfeel: Rich, but with enough carbonation to keep it from being heavy. 
Overall: Finally, a 'big boy' beer that lives up to the hype! I was infinitely disappointed in Dark Lord after pining after it for several years, but I can honestly say I'm not at all disappointed with this. The bitterness actually gets stronger throughout the glass to the point it's almost a bit much, and it's clear that this beer could EASILY and gracefully handle another two years in the bottle. Nonetheless, I'm really bummed out that I missed the 2012 vintage. Good stuff!

4.16/5  rDev -7.1%look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Picked this up in a great trade with Mar02x! Pitch black pour with a beautiful two finger caramel colored head with decent retention and nice lacing. The nose is dark and roasty mocha initially and opens up nicely with big vinous notes and hints of licorice, black cherries, booze, vanilla and coffee. The taste is just as bold and complex with lots of wood and roasty dark chocolate along with hints of burnt coffee, molasses, licorice, oak, leather, black cherries, and vanilla. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with a ton of vinous character and a great bitter warming booze burn on the finish. Overall, I really like how the wine barrel aging emerged and really gave it a unique character that makes it stand out from many of the other big barrel aged stouts. Thanks Mark! 778 charactersbeerdrifter, Jan 11, 2013

Pours black with big brown creamy head. Hangs around for a bit with lots of lacing. Aroma of chocolate, roasted grains, molasses, hints of black licorice, and dark fruits. Don’t get any bourbon or vanilla on the nose, but still smells very nice. Interesting flavor. Strong roasted flavor with seriously bittersweet chocolate. Alcohol warmth on the finish. I do get a bit of the barrel addition, but it is very subtle. Solid stout, but was hoping for a bit more vanilla/chocolate/molasses. Will have to grab another one to mature and see how that helps it. (4.24)
Revisiting now with a 2015 bottle and I must say, this just isn't very good. Seems nearly completely flat, strange wine notes don't mesh with the molassess,, and then there's some ash to go along. Disappointed again. (3.70) 897 charactersBMMillsy, Jan 11, 2013

A - nice dark midnight look with hints of brown; mocha looking 1/8th of an inch head; some bubbles and retention in there
S - chocolate covered cherries; oak char; burnt sugar; some dark grapes or grape juice; that molasses flavor
T - coffee; dark chocolate; subtle cherry; burnt oak; bitter hops; roasted caramel and chocolate malts; that grape/vinous flavor; nuanced vanilla 
M - surprisingly really smooth; a little bitter with the coffee notes; heavy bodied but still smooth; pleasantly light carbonation 
O - I realize I've opened this beer prematurely, but I'm sitting on half a case of 2012s and need to know what this beer drinks like; it's damn good, complex, sweet, bitter, roasty, all of the above wo being overly so in any vein; somehow it's really even-keeled given all the complexity. The oak-wine elements are perfectly sweet. 895 charactersSkeeterBoganski, Jan 09, 2013

Saw that this bad boy has a 100 and it had me intrigued. Even at $12 a glass, Raul couldn't resist - but now Raul wishes that he did.
Look? Like a good stout. Not much to say.
Aroma? A little coffee, toffee even. But nothin' blowin up at me like a gangsta would want.
Taste? HUGE letdown. Boozy, a bit harsh (a bit), and just not that great. I mean, it's palatable, but wow...
Mouthfeel? Is there any? Oh yeah, not much. Raul has had richer, silkier, and more supple Stouts than this thang.
Not only does Raul not approve. He says run. Run to the nearest Old Rasputin that you can find!
Edit: It was served overly cold out of the tap and it is getting better as it warms.
*8 months later, Raul had this again as his palate has matured like an Olson Twin's bank account when she hit 18. Flavor was more robust, but still hot. Mouth feel was a lot richer (almost more than Ashley Olsen) and the nose was more refined than an OC housewife rhinoplasty. Raul agrees, but there is better. 1,056 charactersRaulMondesi, Jan 03, 2013

A - 4.5 - Black, with a thick, textured, lingering, tan head. Only with a Sam Smith's head could it score higher for me.
S - 4.0 - Dark chocolate, a little malty coffee. I thought I got something slightly vinous and then saw on the label that a small percentage of it is aged in wine barrels, so maybe that's it. Possibly some vanilla. Near the end of the glass, after a swirl, a nice, mild, milky coffee note really came out.
T - 4.25 - First impression is wood, more than desirable. Barely noticeable under that is unsweetened chocolate, kind of a powdery version of it, and some coffee. Later, as the head dissipates, the wood notes recede and the other flavors come forward, with the chocolate going a bit sweeter into dark chocolate territory, to make for a better balance. No booze is evident. The label mentions licorice and bourbon barrels but I don't get any of either (I get the wood from the barrels but no bourbon). I wonder if they'd have been more prominent when fresh. No idea what cherry bark, also mentioned on the label, tastes like - presumably wood. I don't taste the vanilla or wine either. Leaves me with a bitter char aftertaste, and later with that plus a sweet chocolate syrup note. 
It's interesting how the experience changes from the top of the glass to the bottom, and not just due to changing temperature. Both of the glasses I poured from the bomber, over about 30 minutes, went through the same transition rather than a single transition spread across both glasses as it warmed. 
M - 4.5 - North of medium bodied but not as heavy as some of its puddinglike peers. Smooth and creamy. A pleasure.
O - 4.25 - This is a well made and subtle stout with mature flavors. Very well done overall. I'd drink it again for sure but wouldn't chase it via trade again. I'm glad I tried it. 1,894 charactersBrownNut, Dec 29, 2012

A- Pitch black with a finger of brown head. Slowly dissipates to a layer that sticks around for the ride.
S- With a full glass the roasted malt is dominant, but as the beer goes down the glass the bourbon barrel aroma kicks in strong.
T - taste is extremely complex with elements of roasted coffee, licorice, and chocolate being the predominant flavors. Each sip last for minutes and changes from sweet to bitter as it linger on the back of the tongue.
M - medium to full body. Drying finish. Each sip begs for the next but this beer is to be sipped and savored.
O - intensely flavorful and complex. I am aging another bottle and will compare tasting notes. I'm expecting it to only get better with age. 736 charactersdmbsteve, Dec 27, 2012

3.52/5  rDev -21.4%look: 5 | smell: 3 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5The infamous 2009 vintage. Cascades murky reddish-brown to give birth to opaque very dark brown-to-black body topped by huge frothy deep-tan head with incredible retention. 
Somewhat bland aroma exhibits unrefined sugar qualities,liquorice, bourbon yielding menthol nasal spray sensation, and a hint of bready malt. Tart notes reminiscent of dark fruit (plums and cherries) and red wine fuel my fears the bottle might be infected. I couldn't tell merely by sniffing that tartness comes from brettanomyces action as the dark fruit esters are commonly found in imperial stouts while vinous qualities are typical of well aged examples. 
With the first sip comes release - I've got a non-infected bottle. Wild yeast infection is not a state, it's a continuous process so it should be badly reflected in the taste by now. Flavor that lacks the lactic sourness I feared of is dominated by liquorice, dark fruits, bourbon and chocolaty roasted malts adding some coffee-ish notes. Malt role and complexity is lesser than I hoped for, thought. Clean dry finish is followed by unobtrusive alcohol warmth. Flavors have mellowed in the course of aging so nothing really stands out. 
Medium to full body is well attenuated, perhaps a bit thinned by aging. The carbonation is not exaggerated as might be deduced from the thick head. The effortlessly drinkable beer has silky texture and is airy and mouthfilling yet not overly so.
Overall, the Abyss is shallower than its advertised depth and considering the hype fails to impress. Not infected, just average. 1,549 characterscrnipeter, Dec 25, 2012

S: smells like an imperial stout should with toasty good grains, seet malt, coffee and caramel and chocolate. 
T: Taste is the same as the smell but also incorporates the barrel flavor. Delicious, but not mind blowing. 
M: beautiful full body with heavyish carbonation and a smooth feeling even with the hefty carbonation. 
O: tasted a 2010, 2011, and 2012 vertical tonight and was not impressed. This was somewhere between hunahpu's and stone IRS, but I had higher expectations due to the rating. Thought 2011 was the best vintage of the 3, and 2012 was no doubt not ready. In the future I will adhere to their best after dates. 845 charactersHolland, Dec 25, 2012

4.39/5  rDev -2%look: 5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 52012 bottle that had me searching all over hell's half acre for it. Took me several minutes to get through the wax, they take this beer seriously. 
A: Pours a black motor oil with a fantastic mouth watering brown dark khaki 1.5 finger head. This beer really shines in the appearance, might be the best barrel aged stout I've seen. 
S: Huge barrel notes, oak is prevalent. Chocolate and coffee notes as well. Not all that over powering, or air freshner beer that I like to call. I don't just want to sit and smell this the way I would with a FSW Anniversary, ST Backwater series, or a Victory at Sea. 
T: Oh wow, this beer delivers. Thick chocolate, creamy, coffee notes, malty back bone. Sweet finish. Tons of chocolate on this one. 
M: Smooth, full bodied, creamy and lasting sweetness. 
O: Great beer, worth the hunt, worth the price, will buy again next season. 869 charactersCommanderOfAwesome, Dec 22, 2012

A: Opaque. Average head dies down to a persistent bit around the edge. Lacing is ok, not as delicate as I'd hoped, but acceptable none-the-less.
S/T: Dark chocolate. Black cherry. Licorice. Subtle hint of bourbon turns a bit boozy as it warms, but remains pleasant. 
M: Thick when it's cold, and smooth when it's warm. Nice all the way around. 
O: Haven't had a Deschutes in a while, but this makes me think of Obsidian on steroids - a good thing. Fairly complex, but easy to approach, and changes just a bit as it warms, keeping my interest. A bit pricey at $15/22 oz, not a daily choice, but definitely something to pick up and shelve for later!
revised 5/13 - still wonderful, just has more competition in my brain from some of the other great brews out there. it's a great time to be a beer enthusiast :) 871 characterslighthabit, Dec 22, 2012

The smell is rich a little boozy but not overwhelming, hints of molasses, chocolate and some fruit comes through.
Taste first the sweetness begins and rolls into the bitterness presented. But the overall flavor makes this beer very complex and fantastic. The fruity currants and rich molasses blend so well together and the bitterness makes this a force to be reckoned with.

I've had many imperial stouts in my life, so I will focus on what I feel makes this one different/better. Starting with the likes:
Crema: I really like the carbonation and head retention. Swirl it around in the glass and it keeps producing a nice "crema" like you'd see on a shot of espresso.
Dry: Sometimes this style can be overly sweet. Not Abyss. This one is drinkable.
Body: Not overly syrupy.
Dislikes: The only think I didn't like was it didn't seem to have much barrel character. I think I would pay more attention to this next time. I must have drank it too fast Also, near the end the coffee-like flavors started to build on the palate and I was ready to move on to something else.
The Porter XXIV was next and I much preferred it. Awesome beers! 836 charactersPrinceDarren, Dec 15, 2012

T: Bitter chocolate, molasses and oak. Dark fruit that is a bit over-the-top and off-putting to me. A metallic tinge that fades as the beer warms to room temperature.

4.17/5  rDev -6.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 42012 vintage on-tap at Deschutes' Portland brewpub. 6 (or 8?) oz. served in a Rastal on November 28th, 2012.
A - It's awful dark in the brewpub, but this still looks pretty black. Medium khaki head that sticks around surprisingly well. Great soapy lacing and plentiful legs.
S - The most striking quality is a blend of caramel corn and a rich, almost buttered, almond aroma. underlying dark chocolate, very slight overripe cherry, and char.
T - Front-end is espresso bean. Mid palate brings in a balancing sweetness of milk chocolate which quickly morphs into a deeper roasted nutty character. I might sense a bit of that more vineous note but it's really subtle.
M - Medium body, good medium carbonation, appropriately smooth into a semi dry finish. Quite nice.
D - I always have grouped this together with Dark Lord and Darkness (and perhaps Kate the Great as well). Of those main three, this is right in the middle for overall impressions. It's enjoyable, but I'm unsure how memorable this will be. 1,006 charactersAuracom, Dec 05, 2012

This is really like staring into the abyss of night. No light escapes it, even against the light. There is a little head, densely packed in tiny bubbles around the glass. Lots of licorice and chocolate: milk and dark. Oak aroma is sweet and far from abrasive. Some vanilla notes accompany the smooth alcohol aroma. The flavor washes in slowly: licorice, lots of molasses richness, and slight alcohol burn to remind me of what I'm drinking. Some bakers chocolate and slight vanilla with a tinge of oak burn. Finish is super dry and body is full. This is a rich ass beer that is great for special occasions: like brewing a winter brown. 769 charactersPhilousa, Dec 05, 2012

A: pours jet black not a photon gets through this brew. A milimeter of pretty dark head fell to a thick ring around the glass.
S: a bit of alcohol and lots of darkness. Sweet smelling. Hints of roasted grain. A bit of that molasses it is brewed with. Small hints of oak and that vanilla note you get from the oaking. Real rich smelling.
T: big roasted grain flavor, sweet at first then finishes off bitter. Not as balanced throughout as expected but in the end it is all there in the right proportions. Delicious. Also getting notes of licorice. Not as much oak as I would expect and not really any molasses. But it is quite good. Need to get a second bottle to save for the best after date.
M: thick and chewy, I almost grabbed a spoon for this stuff. Spot on!
O: wonderful. Like obsidian on steroids in all the best ways. Worth the $18 I paid for the bottle. 980 charactersN3rdM3t4l, Dec 05, 2012

Pours black with a nice mocha head and good lacing.Big notes of chocolate, some roastiness, and a touch of some oak, Flavor was roasty with some licorice and sweeter chocolate at the get go, maybe even a little dark fruit, which then t transitions nicely into some dark, bitter chocolate with with some wonderful charred malt and the vanilla from the bark hiding out underneath. Honestly, I am not getting too much of the barrels in this, but that's okay, still delicious. A fuller, creamy mouthfeel. Some alcohol is noticeable in the finish, which is to be expected from such a high ABV and "fresh" beer. Overall, a wonderful, wonderful beer. I have a huge beer boner for their Red Chair and that remains #1 from Deschutes for me, but this is hands down #2. 907 charactersdenver10, Dec 05, 2012

A - Impressive bottling for an impressive recipe. Capped and waxed black, with trendy, yet elegant label design. (Not to forget the label paper used). Light not even attempt the slightest of penetration through this busty body. Unbelievable sap gold head with an outstanding density in lace.
S - Foremost, wood and wine hit the nose. As the beer thaws, molasses and roasted malts gain ground. 
T - Just spectacular. Highly intricate and engineered to an art. The sugars are of wide-range, which pair nicely with that savory sylvan taste that remains steadfast. Resolves nicely, leaving an acrid finish, but in the best way possible. Spirits are merely accents to the true flavor. 
MF - Soft, making its presence known. Nothing overbearing. Carbonation is permissible.

Poured from a 22oz bottle into a tulip.
A- The beer poured with a very dark, blackish color and resulted in an initial 1/4 inch of mocha/coffee head that reduced to a very thin stout-like head. Lacing was thin and spotty.
S- The aroma was what got me. It started out with coffee, chocolate, and molasses, but was I the only one that picked up a hint of cherry at first? (Upon reading the bottle it all makes sense.)
T- Top notch. Roasty, full-bodied, with lots of chocolate/cocoa. A tad sweet, but I can't quite contribute that to the molasses. I don't get cherry or any other fruityness in the flavor. I also don't pick up any licorice. The vanilla and bourbon become apparent at the end of your sip.
MF- Very bubbly, thick and smooth. Leaves a nice little tingle on the tongue.
O- Loved it. The combination of the aromas and the taste seal the deal on this one. A must try! I will write another next year after I crack the bottle in my cellar. 1,023 charactersRfunk, Dec 03, 2012

From the bottle: "brewed with black strap molasses, licorice, with cherry bark and vanilla added with 6% aged in oak bourbon barrels, 11% aged in oak barrels, and 11% aged in oak wine barrels"
Near black ale with a sheet of tan foam that creeps up the sides. Smells of oak, too much oak, smoke, some licorice, some molasses and a bit of hops (never had this experience in this beer previously). A resiny, bitter character on the nose. Flavor is alcohol, oak, bitter, licorice, toasted malts. I really, really want this to be better, but this is simply the worst iteration I've had. Full bodied with moderate carb and a semi dry finish. I am concerned the prestigious heritage of this beer is faltering. While this is far from the best vintage, this is still a nice beer, and I'm happy to have a couple cases in the cellar, I probably wouldn't have done that had I known about the deviation. 
Vintage 2011, Best by 04AUG12
4/4/4.5/4.5/4- 4.28 on 29NOV11
A: pours a dark, dark ale with nearly two fingers of really dark chocolate foam. This falls to a thick sheet of the same only dissipating once the beer sits for nearly an hour. Cobweb lace when foam present.
S: The bourbon barrel is present (surprising given the low percentage aged), some more oak, molasses, vanilla (subtle). The wood is quite strong when cold, as it warms the cocoa, coffee, molasses and bourbon come through much better.
T: The beer is roasted! Lots of toasty oats, oak, cocoa, bourbon, vanilla. Super refined tannins. Good bitterness to it. The vanilla is there alongside american oak. Black coffee and bittersweet chocolate. 
M: Burly body with lower carb. Nice, long, sticky finish with semi dry resonance.
O: This beer is good, but I don't know how many I will be picking up this year for the cellar. I've found through some recent tastings, that I may prefer this beer fresh. All the better! Makes me long for it in the off-season! 1,946 charactersharrymel, Dec 01, 2012

appearance is great, was expecting a little more thickness in the head but i did pour it rather slowly, has a great medium khaki brown color, 3/4 inch and creamy looking sitting atop some very enticingly black brew.
aromas: whats not to smell in this beer, roasted/burnt malt, strong black coffee, oakiness, some burnt sugars and light note of fruit, fruit aroma very faint, and booziness
taste: this is another beast of a beer, sip with caution, appreciation and respect! everything that you smell in the nose comes out in the taste of this one, lacking in molasses, its there but masked, i was really looking forward to the molasses in this one, also the vanilla is not there too much either. but very malty and oakey with fair undertones of coffee and bittersweet chocolate. This is one to try if you like the style and can find it, probably better to wait for the date on the bottle before drinking as well.
ROUND 2: Drank second 2012 bottle on April 20th 2014, having aged it for a year and a half. Overall: This is a good stout but in my opinion since having the first bottle I've tried many more r.i.s. that are much better, cheaper and much, much easier to find. this one is not worth the price and effort it takes to hunt it down, if you can find one randomly sitting on a shelf for around 15 bucks or cheaper and you've never had it, I'd say go for it just to have the experience but I wouldn't run through hoops to get this one again, nor would I recommend doing so. 1,921 charactersBeerlover, Nov 30, 2012
4.45/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.52009 Bottle (2 of 2 I purchased 2 years ago; I had one last year around the same time and it wasn't infected then and this one also was not, count me in the small minority that got good bottles).
Pours a viscous nearly black color with a solid medium size bubbly mocha head that recedes to leave some spotty lacing on the glass.
Aromas begin with dark espresso, that transitions into a malty sweetness. Then you get some minimal sweet milk chocolate and larger quantity of dark chalky bakers chocolate. The oak, licorice and molasses are all subdued at this point but still emerge more and more as it warms but takes a backseat to the espresso and dark cocoa.
The tastes follow the nose to a tea which is equally as magnificent. Roasted coffee beans and dark liquid chocolate are the initial flavors. Then you get some hints of sweet vanilla and a little milk chocolate. No distinct oak, licorice or molasses flavors but I assume they are adding to the dryness and lingering bitterness in the finish.
Mouthfeel is on the extremely heavy side of medium, not quite heavy with medium-low carbonation. Finish is roasty and dry yet not overwhelmingly so.
Overall this is a beer that is meant to age in my opinion. I have sampled freshed bottled that are too acrid, roasty and biting because of the licorice, dark roasted malts, oak, etc but really develops into a masterpiece after 3-4 years. They have that best after date for a reason on these bottles folks, you would think the brewery would know best... 1,507 charactersclaspada, Nov 29, 2012

Served from deuce-deuce into snifter after having been in my backpack for 30 minutes, so was not frosty but not room temp either. 
I can't add anything that hasn't been said already but for posterity sake, it's a deep dark IS that is rich and complex, loads of chocolate and coffee and was like heaven.
I essentially killed it on my own over an hour and a half (with the wife trying a few sips) and it got better with each passing minute as it warmed up. 
By far the top 2 beers if ever had and probably #1.
Glad I stocked up while I could and have a supplier who can send to me from PDX, because this is amazing! 711 charactersSanFranJake, Nov 29, 2012

4.5/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5It’s easy to see why this stout is so highly regarded; it’s balanced, delicious, and extremely drinkable for such a massive style. The pour is black as night with a finger of tan head that has solid retention and lacing. The body is lovely, full, smooth, and creamy, with moderate carbonation, really just enough to give it some life but still retain its sticky full figured feel. 
The nose greets you with prominent fudgy chocolate; bourbon and oak and roastiness follow; the flavor balances the fudginess with good whiskey character, moderate roast, molasses, mild anise; oak and a restrained but clearly present tannic aspect. Lots of sweetness; nicely chewy; alcohol present but not overwhelming.
This 2011 bottle was loaded with depth and well balanced and most importantly, tremendously tasty. 805 characterstobelerone, Nov 28, 2012

A - Thick, black, small tan head. Looks like a big stout, no complaints.
S - My least favorite part. I'm not a huge fan of licorice, and the licorice and other aromas just didn't play well for me. I was slightly let down until I tasted it.
T - The flavors really come together far better than the aroma. The molasses and licorice play off the roasted malt and some coffee and a mix between milk and dark chocolate. A light barrel note, but seeing that it's 33% barrel aged that makes sense. It really came together quite well, with no alcohol presence either.
M - As good as I could ask. Nice and velvety, smooth, full bodied. No alcohol presence. Great mouthfeel.
O - I'm glad I tried this with 2 years on it. I'm not sure how it is fresh, but 2 years definitely couldn't have hurt it. Unfortunately I only had one bottle I got recently. 904 charactersnrs207, Nov 27, 2012

T. I cant believe this is 11% abv, the boozyness is hiden well amongst all these flavors, roasted grain, coffee, chocolate, figs or raisins, smokey, earthy woodiness, slight bourbon, sweet but ends with a bunt dry dark chocolate taste and feel. A bit allover the place.
M. Light carbonation, velvety, viscous. Coats you mouth in layers of flavor.
O. A good beer, get it while you can. I will cellar one and review again. 593 charactersIPA1978, Nov 25, 2012
4.2/5  rDev -6.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.52011 vintage with a best after 8/4/12 poured into snifter
Appearance: Just a huge black as night beer with absolutely no light penetrating this one. No head to speak of and no carbonation here.
Smell: Smoked wood and big dark fruit with bitter bakers chocolate. A huge oak component from the barrels. A slight bitter coffee is evident in the background.
Taste: A big smoked oak component dominates the palate. Dark fruits and bakers chocolate here with a tart dark fruit. There is also what I'd describe as a tobacco and a leather like taste mixed with the licorice. I definitely get all the barrel aged characteristics of this beer and I'm digging it.
Mouthfeel: This is a spot on for this style. I hold BCBS as a benchmark for the style here and this is not far behind. An amazing palate coating beer. No alcohol to speak of in here.
Overall: From what I've read this should have completely blown me away. Now don't get me wrong I really liked this beer but I must admit I wasn't blown away. 998 characterssleuthdog, Nov 25, 2012

A: pours old engine oil, thick viscosity on the pour, slight thin film that is dark tan/mocha in appearance. no lacing whatsoever. held directly up to the light, there is absolutely no change in appearance.
S: huge dark fruits... eerily reminiscence of GI BCS Bramble Rye. enormous cherries, berries, awesome bigoak and slight bourbon, dark coca, smoked wood, slight tobacco. slight robust coffee in the background. there is a massive complex brew
T: like the nose, this is massively complex. i get a huge dark chocolate, tobacco, black licorice, smoked wood and oak, tart dark fruits, sweet malt backbone. there is some much going on its hard to dissect this brew. 
M: very full bodied and very chewy. leaves an awesome bitter choclate and espresso note ojn the tongue that urges me to take another sip
O: just an outstanding brew. its very bold in favors and is extremely well balanced. i only wish there was a bit more dark fruits or vanilla sweetness that came out in this one. but overall, this one is well deserving of the hype. definitely an outstanding brew. 1,106 characterstut2528, Nov 25, 2012

Black as always, with a dense, dark brown head with good retention and nice lacing, this looks nice (not as nice as some of the bottle pours I've had, but still very good). The nose just makes me sad. All these years, I've been imagining each experience with this beer was as good as my first, but this time, I'm really taken back. Fresh, this beer is a beauty. Yes, it ages fine, but so fresh, it's just so good, I feel bad about having ruined so many bottles in my attempt to improve this beer. A near-perfect blend of chocolate, snappy licorice, mild roasted malt acidity, caramel malt sweetness and some coffee, this beer carries its light bourbon barrel character delicately, with vanilla and mild bourbon notes exquisitely well. The palate is a mirror image of the nose, with the delicacy and balance that I've come to expect from this beer. Opening with waves of chocolate and mild caramel, followed by a great blend of coffee, roast, licorice and mellow bourbon. Some vanilla, a little bit of dark fruit and a beautiful fullness are present. No ashy flavors (that some aged bottles develop) are present. Medium full in body and with a smooth, creamy carbonation, this is really great on the palate. An excellent beverage, best consumed fresh.
**Edit 19 Jan 2014**
My last bottle of the 08 vintage. It sings. Delicately layered chocolate, bourbon, roast, dark caramel and some mission figs. The palate is still stunning, after all these years. Smooth as silk with a velvety heft, the blend of flavors is sublime. Truly exceptional. 4.5/4.5/5 1,669 charactersDefenCorps, Nov 19, 2012

A: Just as dark as the name suggest, black. I can see myself in the glass. Nice thin head that remains the whole time. Good looking spotty lacing.
S: Really complex. Up front it's all wood, like I can just smell the barrels, followed by alcohol, and then underneath all that I smell chocolate, smoke, leather, and faint anise notes. I feel like I could keep rambling on about all the different smells in this beer, wow, so complex.
T: The taste is less complex than the smell, but I think this could be because this is a very fresh bottle (as in not even two weeks old). Tastes almost cola like. I can pretty much sum it up with, cola, smoke, and alcohol.
M: Silky smooth with moderate carbonation. I would say it falls on the very thin side of full bodied.
O: This isn't the first time I've had this beer, I've had it numerous times on tap and a handful of vintages from the bottle, but this is the first time I've actually taken some time to myself to sit down, really think about, and review the beer. I can definitely say that age greatly helps this beer. I had a taste of an 09 bottle recently and it was awesome. Fresh it's kind of all over the place, not bad by any means, but this beer really should be given some time to develop. I guess there's a reason the bottle says best after 11/1/03. I've got another bottle to save, so I'll revisit this beer in a year or so and see how it changes. 1,450 charactersbifrost17, Nov 18, 2012

The beer pours a jet black with a dense tan head that laces. There isn't oily residue, but the head does stick to the sides nicely. The nose is oaky with a touch of bitter sweet chocolate bread and alcohol. The beer drinks smoothly, masking the staggering abv with velvety sweetness and a lingering charcoal bitterness. The beer steamrolls the palate with flavor leaving residual bits of potent stout behind to keep me satiated after each sip. It's a lovely beer and worth the money, although I've been told the 2010 is slightly better... 583 charactersThePorterSorter, Nov 17, 2012

It poured a thick, dark, black with a brown head about a half inch with soft, tiny bubbles. There was not much aroma, just a slight sweet sugar with some roast.
The flavor was dominated by licorice up front followed by a deep roast, almost burnt marshmallow. It finished with a sweet licorice. 
The mouth feel was nice with the small, tight carbonation that was silky, not too heavy or thick. I also noticed some delicate bread-toast malt flavor, and a very faint piney hop at the end.
Overall, this was a special treat, a very complex beer. 618 charactersbrihenry, Nov 12, 2012

 Buzz picks beers 3a. & 3b. Shared with two non-b.a. friends earlier today. Here are the notes.
 3a: Pours opaque, black as night. 1/8" dark caramel colored head, falls to a ring, no lacing.(4.5)
 I was expecting a blast of bourbon, instead I find a wonderfully balanced aroma. Hints of dark chocolate, coco, raisinets, espresso, hints of horehound, vanilla, and toasted marshmallow.(5.0)
 Flavors follows the nose, bitter-sweet chocolate being the dominate flavor, espresso, toasted marshmallow, caramel...its complex, and perfectly balanced.(5.0)
 Full bodied, slightly carbonated, somewhere between dry, and creamy. Easy to drink for a heavy beer.(5.0)
 This, I believe is the best beer that Ive ever had; my tasting partners are digging it as well. It is a perfectly balanced Imp. Stout.(5.0)
3b: Pours opaque, the color of spent motor oil. 1/2" caramel colored head falls to a ring.(4.5)
 This one has some of that bourbon that I was expecting, but not overwhelmingly so...peaty, dark chocolate, espresso, root-beer, and vanilla. Nicely balanced as well.(4.5)
 Flavors follow the nose...bitter-sweet chocolate, & bourbon up front with toasted marshmallow, & root-beer in the middle, with a bitter-sweet finish.(5.0)
 Full bodied, slightly bitter, drier than the other, but still has a slight creaminess. A huge beer that is easy to sip.(4.5)
 Another great beer. Barrel aging is evident, but not overwhelmingly so. Balanced, and easy to drink...a wonderful beer to share amongst friends.(4.5)
 Holy hell we have climbed out of The Abyss...3a was 2007 vintage, 3b was 2010 vintage. Thats so f*#king huge! Never would have guessed that 3a was aged that long, it held up so well to being in the bottle that long, absolutely no oxidation.

Pour: Splashy, incredibly muddy dark brown, but not quite black. Nice two finger deep khaki, that surprisingly leave really nice lacing. Head diminishes to a rim.
Smell: Dark chocolate, roasty coffee, light licorice, and a slight vinous character. Some light vanilla bourbon comes out as it warms.
Taste: Really nice smooth bitter coffee and dark chocolate. Light red wine tannins, as well as some subdued bourbon vanilla as it warms. Finish lingers with dark chocolate.
Mouthfeel: Really smooth. A pretty substantial bitterness, which was surprising, but really complements the roasted coffee and dark chocolate tastes.
Overall: Really pumped t get this with no infection. A fantastic brew. Can't wait to try other vintages. 817 characterscfrances33, Oct 27, 2012

Heavy full-mouth with ample carbonation to back it up. Rich, velvety feel with an easy finish. There’s so much going on in this beer, it’s hard to stay focused. The vanilla makes a showing, but it is fleeting at best. The sweetness instead comes from the semi-sweet chocolate and toffee character. 536 charactersSamichlaus82, Oct 24, 2012

A shes black right out of the bottle before it even hits the glass, a deeper reddish cola edge then I expected after seeing how dark this one looks sitting in the glass, large three fingers of dark foam hangs around for a couple minuets and leaves a few spots of lace
S the nose has a fair bit going for it to say the least, bakers chocolate, molasses, chocolate covered raisins, cinnamon, dried dark fruit, and a blend of wood almost like incense before you burn it, I get a little smoke and the booze is there but not out of control and a little coffee and hard nutty toffee
T thankfully the taste is similar, darker roast with char and more like espresso in the mouth compared to the coffee I could smell, more barrel but its still mellow, very dark licorice and the cinnamon is gone, booze is still there but manageable, complex tasty ultra dark roast 
M its thick and rich with just enough carbonation to give it a little life, a little heat but its more likely to hit your chest then your throat, very long finish of espresso and charred wood 
O a big complex monster of a stout, I was expecting more barrel but this one has everything going for it and some age would make it amazing, the booze needs some time to mellow but everything else is there
I forgot this one was stashed away and I'm not sure why I picked a random Sunday night to drink it but here we are. If this one was forgotten for another year or two it might get a world class score because the booze is a little strong but everything else is there, very complex ale 1,612 characterswordemupg, Oct 15, 2012

A- Poured out pitch black with no light to speak of. Nice brown head on top about a finger high. Nice lacing left. 
S – Light vanilla, molasses, coffee, roasted malts. Pick of some dark fruit. Also has a bit of a wine like aroma. 
T – Strong right out of the gate with a big roasted malt flavor. Vanilla comes through more in the taste. Get some molasses and toffee flavors. Has some dark chocolate bitterness in it. It’s sweet but really not overwhelming at all, it balances some of the bigger flavors. Has a nice cherry like quality as well. 
M – Smooth, creamy and just coats the palate. Medium bodied. Ample carbonation. Just nice all the way around. Slight alcohol burn as it made its way down. 
O – I am usually disappointed in heavy hype beers but not this one. Its in my favorite style so Im sure I am biased but this is a wonderfully full flavored and complex brew.

Nose is dark chocolate and smooth coffee, light oak and licorice. Taste is vibrant and bright, chocolate, molasses, faint licorice in the finish with a touch of dark chocolate lingering. Body is thick, soft and creamy, gentle carbonation. 
***
A-pours a jet black liquid that lets no light pass through. The head is mocha colored, dark, tight, and creamy. The retention, lets just stay it goes no where. The entire glass is covered in lace, thick coating.
S-the nose is a little light. Lots of molasses comes in up front, notes of anise sit behind. Some vanilla and hints of oak come in towards the middle. Dark chocolate sets in towards the back with some faint dark fruits, plums and raisins.
T-the taste is big and good. Like the nose, the molasses is strong right up front. Roasted malts, chocolate, notes of vanilla, and just a touch of oak reside in the middle. Dark fruity malty sweetness comes in towards the back with notes of alcohol, slightly warming
M-full bodied, quite big. Very creamy initially with strong carbonation towards the back that turns a little prickly on the palate. It coats the throat slightly with a drying effect in the back and a bit chalky.
D-very good beer, big flavors and quite a big body. The oak aging isn't really noticeable here, just ever so slightly. Nice roasted malts, the molasses is quite dominant. Ever so faint hints of alcohol and some warming in the back. 1,501 characterscpetrone84, Oct 09, 2012

The beer pours with the viscosity of motor oil, and enters the glass an opaque black, with a chocolate-milk colored head
. The head is thin, yet well retained and leaves a wall of lace. Aromas of dark chocolate, coffee, tobacco, oak, and roasted malt make for a big nose. Super smooth, flavors of chocolate, molasses, licorice, and bourbon dominate, with lighter flavors of oak, dark fruit, alcohol, and vanilla mingling underneath. Abyss is amazingly well blended and balanced, with a full body and lower level of carbonation. Simply wonderful!

4.27/5  rDev -4.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Hybrid review. 2006 bottle shared by Sean, as well as 2011 sampled previously. Served in a Hill Farmstead glass.
A - Half finger of tan foam settles to wisps, thin collar, and minimal lacework. There's a glass-coating brown film left behind. Body is pitch black.
S - Biscotti, roasted malts, char and light smoke, espresso, anise, hint of vanilla and oak, and a bit of milk chocolate sweetness. The 2006 vintage has some mild oxidation setting in, but it's still quite nice and very similar in character. The 2011 had a hint of alcohol, but nothing excessive.
T - The taste of the 2006 is significantly less sweet, with more char, espresso, light licorice, and perhaps a bit of dark chocolate in the finish. The 2011 oddly has more in the way of biscuit, caramel, and Coffee Crisp-esque sweetness. Not a ton of whiskey or barrel in either version. Alcohol is well-hidden, and there's nice flavor depth.
M - Smooth, medium-full body, silken texture, lower carbonation, and light residual stickiness. The 2006 version is a tad thin for the ABV, but otherwise it's quite nice. Mellow, with minimal alcohol presence.
D - I was pleasantly surprised a 6-year old stout held up this well. I prefer the sweeter flavors of the newer vintage but I suspect that's due to age and not a recipe difference. Unlike some other breweries, Deschutes appears to have done a really good job keeping the quality up even as the batch size has grown over the years. Not a beer I find myself craving, but always enjoyable and easy to drink - an Imperial Stout that appeals to a broad range of palates. 1,582 charactersMasterSki, Oct 07, 2012

Appearance is black with a short head that is mocha in color. This imperial stout has a nose with oak, chocolate, roasted malts, molasses and bourbon. It has a taste with more chocolate, some of that bourbon, more roasted malts. Mouthfeel is towards heavy, a creamy texture, but plenty of alcohol present in it. It is a very good beer, but it is potent, so it is best to sip and savor it. 461 charactersmltobin, Oct 07, 2012

The lacing is scattered and and has a light amount of retention. The smell of this beer is loaded with dark malts and some herbal notes. In the mix there is also a good amount of barrel aged aromas coming off of this one as well. The taste was really nice, sweet bourbon-like notes with some fresh oak in there too, there is also plenty of smoked and chocolate flavors in there. The mouthfeel is thick and oily, very smooth and highly drinkable. Overall I was hoping to get more of the Licorice flavors from it but regardless it's a killer brew. Very enjoyable. 676 charactersKnapp85, Sep 28, 2012

A: Pure black. One of the darkest stouts I've seen, even compared to some that are 3-5% boozier. Small ring of creamy brown head.
S: A beautiful harmony of dark fruits, dry chocolate, some sweet vanilla-like oak, a bit of peppery cinnamon and caramel. Very refined, it feels almost modest in some ways.
T: This is a wonderfully well crafted beer. The age is apparent - layer upon layer of deep roasty and fruity flavors. The barrel blend is there but its not the star. Finishes long and dry with a molasses-chocolate vibe.
M: The mouthfeel is elegant - a wonderful sipping beer. 595 charactersmattsander, Sep 23, 2012

Thank you to my BA friend from Oregon for sending this my way some time ago... Decided to make this normal day a special one by opening this beer:
A: Dark as the molasses it was brewed with. A very nice dark brown head which fades relatively quickly but leaves the lacing with a an oily film down the side of the glass.
S: Smells of a drunk in a candy store... sweet chocolate and booze with just a touch of licorice.
T/M: Initially smooth chocolate sweetness, followed shortly by a warm oily and effervescent mouthfeel with more chocolate finished off with a bitter dark chocolate/licorice aftertaste that lingers. 
O: Overall an excellent beer. I was initially not as blown away as I thought I might be, but the beer gets better and better with every sip. It started good and finished great. I liked this beer so much I might just move to Oregon... or at least come out for a visit at the proper time of year (Decemberish). 943 charactersSchreibeers, Sep 08, 2012

fun fact : the first beer consumed in 2012 (~12:15am Noble Fir, 1/1/12)
appearance: served in an oversized snifter - ebony body, big chocolatey head but low retention
smell: bakers chocolate, roasted malt, molasses
taste: I'm a little mystified as to how the Abyss has held up at #13 on the best of BA list, despite the huge competition within the style. I like this beer a lot, but I don't think I view it with as much relative greatness as the aggregate appears to. A very robust stout - rich chocolate, molasses, dark roast coffee, a receding hop profile - green and earthy
mouthfeel: full-bodied and decadent
overall: a great stout, but i went a little overboard on the 2011 batch 787 charactersdirtylou, Sep 04, 2012

Taste. Liccorice, caramel, bitter wood, chocolate, bourbon, vanilla. Sweet, but not sugary.

A - Pours very black, like an imperial stout should with a brown 2 finger head. Good retention/lacing. 
S - Roasted malts, sweet licorice, dark chocolate and brown sugar.
T - Fair amount of oak with slight bourbon undertones, the bourbon isn't the main character here. The licorice isn't overwhelming, thankfully. Semi-sweet chocolate and roasted malts as well. 
M - Thick body with medium carbonation. Just coats your mouth and has a wet finish. 
O - Such a solid offering here! It covers all the bases and hits all the right notes for me. 558 characterscvm4, Sep 03, 2012

Aroma is rich roasted malt, bitter chocolate, warm bourbon, black cherries, and just a hint of red wine. A quick swirl brings that rich oily head back up again, along with a delicious earthy flash of nuttiness on the nose.
Taste is smooth and complex. Dry cocoa, molasses, licorice, rich caramel, bitter roasted malt, vanilla, dark fruit, booze, oak, and a nice smoky char blend together wonderfully.
Mouthfeel is thick, viscous, velvety.
Overall a rich, complex imperial stout that uses barrel aging expertly. 679 charactersdraheim, Aug 31, 2012

4.38/5  rDev -2.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5We pop our bottle of 2010 stock and pour a jet black brew. It holds a brief one finger head of dark brown bubbles. This recedes rather quickly, leaving a ring of bubbles around the glass’ edges, and a ghostly film across the top of the liquid. Swirls slosh patterned, spotty lacing around the glass, and produce an even bigger, better retaining head than the original pour. The brew appears syrupy, and the lighter looking carbonation rises slowly. No sediment is noted. The aroma is heavy with dark chocolate malts and molasses. The former show a thick metallic sheen, and a soy sauce saltiness. The bourbon barreling becomes apparent only with warmth, but when it does it stings the nostrils with burning fumes. Buttery diacetyls and light vanilla help to add spice, while cooling the aroma a bit. Our first impression is that there is such a deep char and smoke to this, while it stays very sweet with syrupy chocolates. As we sip, sugary sweet melted chocolate nibs, mixing with metallic, chocolate malts start things off. The bourbon flavoring is there, but quickly mixes with the deepest, smokiest burnt malts, which reduces its prominence. The peak is sweet, with cooked brown sugar, warm molasses, black pepper, buttery bourbon, and general fusel booziness. These all mix, pushing to a finish that is smoother, with rich melted chocolate, clean chocolate and caramel malts. It is actually quite sweet and incredibly smooth until an insane char, smoke, booze, and a curious hot pepper spiciness rumble up from the last drops left in the mouth. The aftertaste breathes of fusel booze, thick char, smoked ham, raw cocoa, and raw coffee bean. The body is thick as mud, and the carbonation is light to medium. Each sip affords nice, sticky slurp and pop, with a slick coating all over the lips and palate. The booziness helps to scorch and dry the mouth, leaving it slightly astringent with the raw chocolatiness of it all. The abv is strong and the beer catches up with you, but it drinks nicely. You just don’t want to see it go, so you certainly sit back and let it set its own pace.
Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the flavoring. The char is outrageous!! This aspect really sets up for a unique malt base for the buttery, toasty bourbon, and the wildly sweet raw and milk chocolates. These all mix for a completely new flavoring that is so complex and gorgeous. The mouthfeel is sticky and inviting, giving you just one more reason to go in for another sip. We were looking high and low for the licorice throughout, but we were never able to pin it down in the nose, and only mildly on the back of the flavoring with black pepper and booze. Regardless, this is a dark, gritty, bold beer that everyone should try at least once. 2,756 charactersTheBrewo, Aug 22, 2012

Appearance - Jet black pour. Nice mocha head with a variety of bubble sizes. Laces and clings all over.
Smell - Licorice comes through a ton. Coffee malts, chocolate. Fudgy, probably due to the molasses. Oaky. I don't get much bourbon
Taste - Intensely fudgy. Strong oak presence. Licorice is more mild. The chocolate is really intense, especially in the finish. A slight astringency, maybe from the wine. Bitter chocolate finish that comes off as a black coffee.
Mouthfeel - Nice and thick. Not quite chewy. Not a ton of booze. Warming, but not boozy. The flavors hang around forever.
Overall - Complex stout. The flavors bend nicely. Very well crafted. I'd love more bourbon, but the stout shines through well. 779 charactersAlieniloquium, Aug 17, 2012

Pours a jet black and opaque beer. The tan head is 1 finger and a half with fair retention and a good amount of lace.
Aromas are powerful -- rich, dark malts, vanilla, oak wood, licorice, dark chocolate and espresso.
Flavors are strong and malty and include roasted grains, sweet chocolates, coffee and hop bitterness.
Feel is smooth and full-bodied. I get a nice alcohol warming as the beer finishes bittersweet, with aftertastes of chocolate and coffee.
Overall this is a heavy hitting stout, full of flavor. Not my top from this style, but a true contender. Recommended.

Poured my allotment into a snifter. Pours a dense coal-black with a thin, wispy, mocha head on top. The nose is rich and sweet with plenty of vanilla, oak, chocolate, charred toast. Really nice. With a beer this big, I like a bit of depth in the feel. This one delivers. Heavy full-mouth with ample carbonation to back it up. Rich, velvety feel with an easy finish. There's so much going on in this beer, it's hard to stay focused. The vanilla makes a showing, but it is fleeting at best. The sweetness instead comes from the semi-sweet chocolate and toffee character. With such a small percentage of this seeing the bourbon barrels, I'm not surprised that that is downplayed as well. Mild spiciness on the back end, and a slight tart kick to finish this one out. Fantastic beer. One I was glad to trade for, and one I will hunt down again. 931 charactersOnenote81, Aug 01, 2012

Couldn't wait any longer. 11% ABV. Brewed with black strap molasses and licorice, with cherry bark and vanilla added. 6% aged in oak bourbon barrels, 11% aged in oak wine barrels, 11% aged in oak barrels.
A: Black, but not as intensely so as I expected. A tight, thin mocha head has a hint of creaminess and fades rather quickly. The beer is rather cold at the moment. Good lacing.
S: Mmmm. Stern and stout. Coffee, roasted malt, bourbon barrels, and a touch of something dry, either the malt or trace hops. Nutty and woody, with no hint of vanilla but perhaps some of bark (whatever that might smell like). Pleasant, but unimpressive.
T/M: That is a mighty first sip, though I'm afraid my impatience has gotten the better of me...I should let it warm up. Loads of flavor lingers interminably. Rich, smooth, roasted malt that is only accentuated by time; a bit of warmth results in a velvety smoothness that is highly pleasing. Chocolate, vanilla, hints of strong stuff...perhaps whiskey. A dry, bitter endtaste worthy of a Russian Imperial Stout. Lightly dry at times, partially from the dry malt and somewhat from the alcohol content. Not heavy though, but light, sippable, and sometimes fruity. The wine parallels are almost certainly my imagination, but are also not entirely inaccurate. The blending is excellent and the extreme alterations in flavor -- from sweet to bitter, fruit to coffee, soft vanilla to dry-strong molasses -- are executed with subtlety and nuance. I'm impressed, but not overwhelmed.
O: Is this a good beer? Absolutely. However, I'll try to an older vintage to say whether or not it's overrated...as it stands, it receives high marks, but not my adulation. Still, recommended.
EDIT 6 February 2013: 2012 Reserve, best before 1 November 2013. Pretty fresh I guess. 11.1%. Brewed with black strap molasses and licorice, with cherry bark and vanilla added. 6% aged in oak bourbon barrels, 11% aged in oak wine barrels, 11% aged in oak barrels.
This is fresh, as was my last sample, and it surprises me naught that I'd change very little from my initial review (save perhaps giving the appearance a 5/5). 2,255 charactersAgentMunky, Jul 28, 2012

Appearance: Black glass shows an angry blood red edge that intimidates. Holds it's dark tan head with a large bubbled halo. Watching the legs slowly drag spots of lace off the glass about the speed of a sunset. 
Smell: Boozy oak tannin overwhelms most of what's going on. Hints of sweet burnt sugar poke through.
Taste: Bourbon oak aged flavors are on top of everything, but with some sophistication, like a well worn leather chair. The boozy wood barrel serves as the bitter to balance out the sweet malty base that slowly fades out to an alcoholic vapor. Pipe tobacco, leather, black strap, with a surprise piney citric hop flash at the top. 
Mouthfeel: Low carbonation combines with the molten lead texture to give a very silky smooth feel with a serious chew.
Overall: A wonderful combinations total out to a great experience. A slow evening worth of happy sips. Solid show, will seek more.
Revisit 2014 (sampled 5/9/15)
Upping the smell from 3.5 to 4.25, don't know if popping the last one a touch early or they have played with the brewing process, but this year is all of the good things above with a little less hops, but just dimensions of complex tastes. 1,216 charactersHardTarget, Jul 23, 2012

4.32/5  rDev -3.6%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.52010 vintage shared by shutyourface. Had the '11 many times, and this is my first time with any of the previous years.
Pours a syrupy black with some tan head, though it recedes in due time. Molasses, dark roast, bourbon, and toffee compose a respectable aroma.
Oily, viscous body delivers this deeply roasted stout to my lips. Some initial sweetness up front before coffee, bourbon, and even some hops join the fray. Finishes mildly bitter with a touch of booze as it descends. Excellent!
Abyss is one of the absolute best off-the-shelf RIS made anywhere. It's remarkable that they can produce so much of it without sacrificing quality ('09 be damned!). Undoubtedly a highlight of every future November. Cheers! 715 charactersbrystmar, Jul 12, 2012

I was immediately struck by its dark, almost black appearance. Regal-like, in fact. I poured it into a chalice-like glass and observed a moderate lacing that lasted. The smell was pleasant but not overwhelming, and the taste was as rich as it looked. I wasn't overwhelmed with a strong licorice taste (as I had feared). Instead, a touch of oak and a sweet caramel-molasses taste dominated. I loved the opportunity to try this masterpiece! 593 charactersIlafan, Jul 03, 2012

4.23/5  rDev -5.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 42011 Vintage. thanks to Gkunkle for the bottle.
Appearance: Deep black. Runs dark brown and deep red at the edges. Head is a red-tinged dark tan. Drops to a spotty head with a thin collar. Almost no lacing. Pours heavy and thick.
Smell: Deeply roasted with touches of char. Mild licorice root as in black licorice. Sweetness lingers. Burnt malts and some roasted malts. Overcooked malts. Touch of caramel sweetness buried in there. Touches of wood with a mild vanilla edge. Just a faint edge of bourbon and booze. 
Taste: Riddled with char and burnt malts. Sweetness is solid And helps pull some of the bitter burnt edges. Wet leather and a solid hit of tobacco leaf. Bitter cocoa and some dark chocolate. So much cocoa. Sweetness builds as the beer warms, but so does everything else. Loaded with leather. 
Mouthfeel: Full body without being syrupy. Almost no carbonation to speak of. Smooth and solid. A drying touch. 
Overall: Age benefits this beer. That doesn't mean it's anything less than stellar when it's young. Great depth and balance. Not as beefy as others in the class. 1,087 charactersGoblinmunkey7, Jun 24, 2012
4.05/5  rDev -9.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 42010 release.
Pours almost pitch black, with motor oil consistently. Pretty small head, which reduces quickly.
Smell is fine. The normal stout smells - chocolate, coffee, some boozy malty sweetness - plus a bit of dark fruit in there. It's a bit muted, though.
Taste is the smell, but more pronounced. Bitter chocolate and coffee, some dark fruits, vanilla and molasses kind of sweetness, and a hint of booziness. It's all really well balanced. 
Mouthfeel is good, nice and thick and mouth-coating, but there's very little carbonation, which is kind of a bummer. Not looking for a ton, but this is almost flat.
This is a really great beer, but it hurts a bit for drinkability. I split this bottle with a group of friends, and had about a 5oz pour. That was enough for me. Still, a solid offering and one I will definitely be looking to try again in the future. 865 charactersrodkin, Jun 23, 2012

4.21/5  rDev -6%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5I sampled a 22 ounce bottle of the 2011 Reserve. This beer has a "best by" date printed on it: August 4, 2012. I'm glad I bought a few bottles so I can store some and wait a couple of months. 
This beer pours a viscous, slick black and produces a light brown head with traces of red that dissipates slowly. More lacing than I expected.
The aroma is appealing but not very pronounced. Coffee, wood, and a trace of fruit, perhaps plums and/or cherries. 
The taste is big and complex. Coffee, molasses, brown sugar, cherries, plums, vanilla, slight smokiness, etc. Use your imagination. Too boozy to rate a five, but it's damn close.
The mouthfeel is smooth-smooth-smooth and coating. The carbonation really disappears as you continue to drink, but you won't miss it. Very warming due to the alcohol content of 11%. 
This is a great beer. I'm sure it gets even smoother and more complex with age, but you really ought to give it a taste if you have some in your possession. A stellar imperial stout! 1,001 charactersanthonygrg, Jun 16, 2012

2010 vintage with a "best after" date of 11/15/11.
300th review.
pours your standard imperial stout-used motor oil black while yielding 3/4" of a thick, creamy, mocha toned head. retention is very respectable for the style, as is the lacing. the nose is mouth-watering: big bold notes of chocolate, coffee, and roasted malt with secondary elements of licorice and molasses, maybe a little bourbon. yummy.
taste follows the aroma closely with lots of the aforementioned; a touch of vanilla i missed in the nose. and while there's a splash of booziness in the finish, otherwise the 11% ABV is well-hidden. to be sure, this is a tasty, decadent brew. great mouthfeel, velvety with a medium-full body; average carbonation.
overall, well, i told myself i wouldn't be swayed by the hype but in the end? yeah this is a stellar beer. no question.

A: Dark brown body, rich creamy light brown head that left great lacing.

T: AMAZING! This is the first top big BA Double/Imperial stout I have had that wasn't overpowered by the bourbon or BA flavor. Awesome complexity of flavors.
M: Smooth and light for how big of a beer this is, Carbonation was on the low end but it was still good.
O: This was an awesome beer, so glad I finally got to try it. Loved the different flavors that came out in it. Very drinkable Very enjoyable. Amazing! If you can get your hands on this beer do it! 664 charactersanimortician, Jun 06, 2012

A - Pours black and viscous with a dense mocha head. Shows great retention at one finger and leaves great lacing.
S - Roasty chocolate and vanilla oak dominate. Some dark fruits give the aroma a bit of a red wine character. Very complex aroma that gives me something new every whiff. 
T - The flavor is intense. Starts with bittersweet chocolate and follows with cherry vanilla. Lots of whiskey on the finish, continuing into the alcohol burn. Aftertaste has all of the oak barrel notes advertised on the label. Very good and the heat of the alcohol fades after the first few sips as the beer warms. 
M - Carbonation is light and the body is thick. This makes for a smooth texture that compliments the flavors.
O - I enjoyed it a lot and think it will be even better with a bit of age. I think a year or two in the cellar will cut the heat, spotlighting other flavors. Good stuff! 1,034 charactersNoLeafClover44, May 23, 2012

A: Dark as an abyss, same as it ever was. Of particular note is how the brown khaki head stays consolidated and well, VERY solid, thick and creamy. Fades down to having a crimson candy trim. 
S: Not too much this way. Mild roastiness initially, then astringent alcohol later.
T: Fairly nuanced, but no real barrel presence. Roast, chocolate, latte, vanilla, alcohol, no heat, just firmness. More alcohol as the glass gets empty. 
M: Not nearly the body of the '10 I had in a bottle. Nice to the palate, appropriately low carbonation. 3/4 fullness.
O: Good, but I like a bottle with 1.5+ years under it 642 charactersCharlieMurphy, May 23, 2012

A: A pitch black pour with a nice dense medium brown head. Fades very slowly, leaving an almost solid wall of lacing behind. 
S: Hearty roasted malt with some dark chocolate and coffee beans. A bit oaky with some anise and molasses. Creamy.
T: Up front there is oaky vanilla, toffee and molasses along with a boat load of roasted malt. Bitter char with some creamy chocolate and coffee mixed with quite a bit of anise, especially as it warms up. Tons of lingering bitter coffee, chocolate, anise and a little smoke in the aftertaste. Flavors are sharp and just a touch boozy.
M: Heavy. Fairly thick but not syrupy. 
O: Deceptively big imperial stout. I've had weaker beers that feel like they're twice as strong. Flavors are complex, varied and well balanced. Flavors stand out and are quite sharp as previously noted. Overall a great stout, up there with some of the best. With some more age and some mellowing it could become incredible.

Appearance is dark and viscous. Let out a decent "psht" upon opening.

Taste...I now know what balance everyone raves about. A tinge of alcohol followed by heavy chocolate and coffee that just laaays across the palate. Finish is sweet but also drys a bit with faint hops.
Mouthfeel, well, its excellent. The flavors come on slow but relentless, and stick around for quite some time.

A: Body dark as a moonless night. Thin brown head that dissipated pretty quickly leaving a thin ring around the edge and a few lily pads in the middle. Very oily appearance. 
S: Some chocolate, dark fruits, dark roasted malt, nuttiness and molasses. There’s a little whiff of woodiness but not much barrel on the nose. 
T: Yum. Sweet and woody to start with a little smokiness. The wood characteristic is as good as any beer I’ve ever had. Some caramel, dark fruit and coffee. Then the roasted malt eases you into a pleasing gentle finish. 
M: Body is very full and oily (borderline syrupy). Carb is soft which I don’t mind at all in this case. Finish is slightly chalky but very smooth for such a big complex beer. Alcohol is very well hidden. 
O: When I first read the label (licorice and molasses?) I had serious doubts about it. Who knew that it would become one of my desert island beers. Just amazing. 988 charactersmjtiernan, Apr 23, 2012

A: Dark as a beer can be. No head, no lace, nuthin'. Just liquid.
S: Ground espresso beans. That stands out the most. Bittersweet, dark chocolate at the end.
T: Perfectly balanced between espresso, wood, and dark chocolate. They all come together to create a delicate yet robust flavor that fills the mouth with amazing flavors. The best roasted malt flavors I've ever experienced. Nothing overpowers. "Balance" is a rare word used to describe a Stout.
M: What can I say? One of the easiest drinking Stouts I've ever had. And it's an Imperial Stout. And it's around 11% ABV. Could have had several more glasses.

Beautiful opaque black viscous pour yields a reasonable mocha head that dissipates into a splotchy puddle with a nice ring.
Nose is deep roasted malts with a hint of sweetness. Definitely get the molasses. Some brown sugar, a bit of leather, cappuccino, milk chocolate.
Taste is supremely roasted malts, black licorice, leather, tobacco, dark chocolate, dark cherry, espresso. Super complex. Layers and layers of flavors. Finish is quite dry and has me reaching for more.
Mouthfeel is excellent, velvety and full. 
Overall this is an excellent imperial stout. Glad I got a second to cellar. 608 charactersnatemort13, Apr 18, 2012

Wanted to review something I enjoy, I enjoy it enough that my 2010's never made it to 2012. 
2011 Best After 8/4/12 Poured into Duvel glass
A: 3/4 inch dark mocha head that retains well and eventually dissipates to a nice ring around edges of glass, jet black color, very good carbonation for style, decent lacing for an Imperial Stout
S: Coffee, dark chocolate, licorice, variety of wood, molasses, brown sugar, vanilla, as it warms a touch of bourbon comes out
T: Licorice, dark chocolate, cherry, oak barrel, molasses, bit of vanilla, and as it warms the wine flavors poke through and add some sour and dry, but not too strong, still very pleasing 
M: Smooth, creamy and velvety, carbonation takes a back seat but is there, medium-full bodied, nicely balanced 
O: Very good Imperial Stout, I enjoy the journey through The Abyss every time, can't wait to taste the bottles left as it ages and changes 920 charactersderkfromwi, Apr 17, 2012

2011 Edition.
A: Pours an opaque inky black in color with some very faint dark brown hints when held up to the light. The beer has a finger tall dark tan head that reduces by about 50% but a nice thick flavor remains covering the entire surface of the beer. Significant lacing is observed. 
S: Wow, this beer has a really enticing smell. Lots of dark chocolate (almost fudge-like in smell) and some dark cherry fruit sweetness. There are some more subtle hints of anise, coffee, and some oak/wood.
T: This beer has a full dark roasted malt body but with quite a bit of sweetness. There is a great sweet dark chocolate almost brownie-like flavor with some great dark cherry fruit flavor. Lots of freshly brewed coffee notes and some hints of anise. The bourbon also really comes through in the flavor with the contributions of oak, tannins, and some vanilla.
M: Full bodied with low to moderate amounts of carbonation. Creamy.
O: This is a really phenomenal stout - I really enjoyed the dark cherry fruit contribution to the flavor and smell. Amazingly complex but well balanced. This is a great beer and I want more. 1,151 charactersdbrauneis, Apr 15, 2012

edit: just tasted 12, 14, 15, and 16 vintages all in the same tasting, and was really impressed with how different they all were. slight variations in barrel ageing, and the cellar time have yielded radically different beers. some with more of a licorice vibe, some red wine, others notes of anise and tobacco, pretty astounding really, and obviously an enjoyable experience. i will be on the one for now, one for later train with this one from here on out... 2,399 charactersStonedTrippin, Apr 15, 2012

2011 vintage tap pourned in snifter, the sun could not penetrate its deep brown blackness! Nice dark brown head which subsided leaving bits of lacing. Amazing mouthfeel, molasses & chocolate hit you immediately, hints of smokey vanilla, cherry oak, and pinot barrell goodness come in. A delicate flavor indeed, no sign of its 11%ABV 1.10 OG, a very well rounded stout. Quite a process to create this beauty after speaking with Joey and Robin from Deschutes. A must try!! 542 charactersTad, Apr 11, 2012

From bottle to Jackie O's snifter:
A: The Abyss is inky black, dark brown around the edges. A beautiful two finger medium brown head slowly settles down to a half finger. Pretty good lacing. Thick, viscous legs cling to the sides of the snifter. Excellent.
S: Wow, quite a lot going on here. The initial impression is dark chocolate fudge brownies with some dark cherry fruit notes. Delving deeper, I detect some coffee, traces of anise, and just a bit of molasses. I really enjoy big stouts that incorporate a lot of fruit character, and this does that nicely. Lots of dark baking chocolate and some anise and woody notes. Very good.
T: Lots of baking chocolate, some dark fruit, a surprising amount of hop presence with faint citrus notes peeking through now and again, and very strong oak and coffee notes. The finish is very drying, somewhat tannic. A kiss of booze pops up on the end as well. Very little bourbon character. A lot of chocolate, molasses, and dark fruit. Doesn't quite the nail the finish, though, which has too much coffee and oak char for my taste.
M: Well balanced and full bodied. The first three-quarters of this is damn near perfect, with a soft, creamy mouthfeel of chocolate and delicate fruit. The aftertaste, though, is too much coffee and tannic quality from the barrel.
O: Good, but slightly disappointing as I was expecting greatness. The mouthfeel and finish on this are just somewhat off. I really liked the dark fruit qualities in this stout, but was surprised and put off by a finish with too much coffee, oak, and maybe even hop. Huh. 1,622 characterssiege06nd, Apr 07, 2012

A: Black with a bit of a reddish tint. Nice lacing. It's not completely opaque. Very little head. 
S: Smells amazing (and big)... chocolate, roasted malts, vanila. 
T: Starts really sweet and finishes bitter. Alcohol is well hidden. Vanila, oak, chocolate, very complex, but well balanced!

2012 Vintage - update
So,,, after having 2010 vintage about 8 months ago, I was able to obtain several more vintage bottles and most importantly, fresh 2012 bottles. I have to say that fresh bottle is quite good, but it's... kind of... all of the place. I taste more dark fruits but I get too much hops and booze. What I didn't get much of was the barrel characteristics - not much vanilla, oak, bourbon, etc. I recently had 2011 bottle and it tasted closer (but worse) to the 2010 bottles reviewed above. I will update this review again after I open 2007 and 2008 bottles as well as 2012 bottles years down the road. Fresh, I much (much) preferred 2012 Parabola over 2012 Abyss. Aged, 2010 Abyss was better than 2011 Parabola by a noticeable margin. 1,364 characterssukwonee, Mar 28, 2012

-Pitch Black.
-Chocolate milk thick head (I've come to see this as a good sign)
-Aroma of subdued-but-still forefront candy molasses, dark chocolate, with some bitter coffee bringing up the rear. Almost like sniffing a dark chocolate candy bar.
-Tastes of dark molasses beginnings, followed by the dark bitter chocolate (not too sweet, but not too bitter) and brought back to earth by the drier coffee.
-Mouth feel was heavy, creamy, and smooth. Carbonation was there, but it takes a back seat to everything else.
I just wish I was smart enough to have bought another 2011 Abyss bottle to age, but damn was I there at the Deschutes event when I heard the Abyss was back during the SF beerweek. 811 charactersBoatsSinkBro, Mar 23, 2012

(From a hollow-stemmed chalice)
Appearance: The Abyss pours almost black - with a tiny mahogany tint, I think - with a good chocolate-tan head that lingers well, leaving a load of lacing.
Smell: The beer smells like the stuff dreams are made of. I'm getting coffee, chocolate and vanilla. There might be some summer fruits in there. It's getting oakier as I drink it. 
Taste: Where do I start? Yowza! At first I feel like I'm eating a chocolate cake - the beer is so sweet and the beer's thickness adds to that sensation. The Espresso kicks in, demanding your attention so that you notice the final sweetnesses in the finish, which is a solid kick of molasses along with a bit of oakiness.
Feel: Unbelievably soft, smooth and full. There isn't much in the way of carbonation, but what is there is just right.
Overall: I love the big imperial stouts and I think this might be the best I've had. The Abyss is a pleasure to look at, a pleasure to smell and a pleasure to drink. Awesome. 1,004 charactersDuke, Mar 21, 2012

Pours jet black with about 1 finger dense mocha head that quickly fades but leaves beautiful brown flecks of lacing. 
This smells outstanding! Aromas of coffee, dark chocolate, roasted malts, brown sugar, oak, faint vanilla, some dark fruit and a hint of booze. This is one of those stouts that I can keep smelling and picking up different notes as it warms up. 
Wow. The taste delivers what the smell promised and then some. Bittersweet chocolate and burnt coffe flavors hit first while there's still a bit of a chill on the glass. Roasted malts, slight boubony booze and wood start creeping in. Molasses, leather, brown sugar and hints of vanilla all pop up to varying degrees as it heats up. Long bitter (semi hoppy) aftertaste with the 11% abv only sometimes peeking through the myriad flavors. 
A viscous thick mouthfeel without much carbonation at all. Leaves a slick coating on the tongue. This is almost exactly like an imperial stout should feel. 
I'm glad to have finally tried this legend. The Abyss has rightfully earned a place as one of the finest, most complex stouts that I've tried. I wish I'd bought more than 3, seeing as shipping was a killer. I look forward to trying those other 2 once that "best after" date has long past.  1,431 charactersThickNStout, Mar 06, 2012

The beer pours a dark brown opaque body with a tan head that dissipated quickly. The head clings to the side of the glass, just by the pour you can tell it's a rich thick beer.
The nose is light, some chocolate and coffee, with notes of vanilla in the nose followed by a tad of oak and bourbon.
Amazing flavor, just out of this world good and surprisingly complex. Filled with chocolate and coffee, there's a touch of vanilla, licorice, a nice subtle oak-iness that gives the sweetness depth. Incredibly well-balanced smooth imperial stout.
A very full-bodied beer, the Abyss boasts in it's rich creamy mouthfeel, almost like silk it's so smooth. When paired with the complex flavor profile it just makes this one of my all-time favorite beers to enjoy after some aging. 828 charactersProspero, Mar 05, 2012

S- Big sweet boozy and fruity aroma. Lots of licorice and molasses, along with a big roasted aroma with dark chocolate.
T- Sweet and roasted up front. Definitely lots of licorice and molasses up front, accompanied by an almost charred roastiness. Towards the end some dark fruit flavors come out more, along with very mild bourbon and subtle oak.
M- Full-bodied, carbonation is on the low side but is perfect for the style, smooth and thick feel. Alcohol is just slightly warming, not hot at all.

Beer pours a dark brown/black with a thin tan head. Aroma is a nice mellow roast with hints of chocolate and oak. Flavor is nice, but it doesn't quite live up to the hype, it has a nice mellow roasty flavor, but I don't understand why everyone goes crazy about it. Mouthfeel is full bodied and very nice. Overall this is a great stout, but it's not quite as good as expected given its advanced billing. 455 charactersstarrdogg, Mar 03, 2012

a- extremely dark beer, but not as pitch black as I had hoped. a thin dark-golden head that quickly dissipated. 
s- very dark chocolate with a hint a sweetness. a mild oak smell. everything blends together for very nicely. An olfactory delight. the smell really got my toes tingling. 
t- roasted malts, chocolate and a balanced amount of surprising bitterness. I really enjoyed the aftertaste on this one, where the vanilla and caramel really came out. Alcohol comes through a bit but with time I believe it will mellow out.
m- this beer is very full bodied. mild carb and an enjoyable film in my mouth that made me look forward to the next sip.
o- I have enjoyed every Deschutes beer that I have had, and this one is no exception. It is well balanced and makes me lament the last drop. I have another one sitting in the closet and in a year or two I can only hope that it gets better. 927 charactersjorgeg528, Feb 29, 2012

i had it in seattle at full throttle bottles. it was not served in the correct glass so i felt the color was a little light. it had a great balance of hops and was very intricate! it was refreshing in every way. the smell was floral and sweet and it hit the spot head on! i would reccomend this stout to anyone who isn't affraid to try something juuuust a little different!.... 516 characterscccupps3, Feb 25, 2012

Review #1000.
pours out a completely opaque midnight black colour. motor oil viscosity. dark tan frothy head, almost pure brown in hue. sticks and stays with gusto. a lot of clinging lace. lovely aroma of dark roasted, chocolate, and other assorted malts. a good deal of chocolate candy aromas..some fruit enhanced and others toffee and nougat inspired. vanilla bean and bright espresso notes as well. blissful taste profile...the chocolate and dark roasted coffee notes really dominate...barrel notes add some depth of oak and bourbon, with subtle hints of ripe red fruit and port wine. the molasses and anise notes only contribute to the amazing depth of layers and the overall huge structure of this stout. hop flavour and bitterness are impressive in its overall herbal and flowery glory, but gets buried by the overall level of hot booziness. but it seems well integrated in the overall flavour profile. impressive. i love the body on this...soft, supple and secure in its massiveness. mouthfeel is incredibly velvety; as smooth as can be for such an amazingly big stout. it certainly has some rough and tumble edges but they are welcome in this beer. drinkability is off the charts...i had a hard time not gulping this huge beer down!
overall this one lives up to the hype. i've fallen into the abyss and there is no coming back. i love the layered complexity, i love the overall character, and i love the feel of this monster stout. it's a bit hot, but time will tame it. about perfect as far as i'm concerned. 1,534 charactersbudgood1, Feb 25, 2012

Pours dense pitch black color with a 1 finger dense dark tan head with great retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lasts. Nice dense soapy lacing clings on the glass; looks awesome. Aromas of big dark chocolate, roasted malt, cherry, oak, light char, coffee, cocoa, molasses, caramel, toffee, vanilla, licorice, toast, and roasted earthiness. Incredible aromas with big complexity of dark malt, oak, and barrel character; and extremely balanced. Taste of big dark chocolate, roasted malt, coffee, molasses, light char, cherry, oak, toast, toffee, vanilla, cocoa, licorice, light smoke, and roasted earthiness. Lingering notes of dark chocolate, roasted malt, coffee, molasses, light char, cocoa, oak, licorice, light smoke, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic depth and complexity of dark malt flavors with the barrel character and flavor additions; with a fantastic overall balance of all flavors; and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium carbonation and very full bodied; with a very creamy, slick, and lightly chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is extremely well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic blended imperial stout! Huge depth and complexity of flavors with incredible balance; and very smooth to sip on. An extremely enjoyable offering to sip on slowly. 1,439 characterssuperspak, Feb 20, 2012
4.55/5  rDev +1.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5A bomber of the 2010 vintage poured into a CBS Snifter.
A: Pitch-black with a quarter inch mocha head that dissipates quickly.
S: An aggressive sweet and oak-y scent rushes to the nose. Licorice helps drive the sweetness upfront, with more subtle roasty notes in the back alongside the oak. A little of the chocolate you'd expect from a big stout also.
T: A sweet stout, but not overwhelmingly so. The licorice is very noticeable, but I enjoy it here. Some roasted malts in the back, with a little sweet chocolate as well. The finish is of sweet malts and licorice. There is a small amount of oak underlying the stout that you can taste throughout. However, if I didn't know The Abyss was partly oak-aged, I don't think I would be able to pick it out. I think it would fade in to the sweetness.
M: Medium-light bodied with low carbonation. This is perfect--supremely drinkable.
O: This is a nice beer. It's a sweet one and the licorice plays a more central role than I expected, but it works. A great beer and one I look forward to having again in the future! 1,064 charactersHophead717, Feb 19, 2012

The Abyss pours a dark brown color w/ a two finger chocolate head. Excellent lacing on my New Belgium glass. The nose is oak, vanilla, chocolate, coffee, and molasses. Very mellow and balanced. None of the 11% abv evident at all. The taste is really smooth and balanced- with coffee and oak out in front. Again, none of the alcohol is present in the taste. Feel is medium full, w/ a nice hops bite on the aftertaste. Overall, really happy I finally got to try this beer. Cheers! 522 charactersjayhawk73, Feb 18, 2012

4.83/5  rDev +7.8%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5My last 2008 Vintage poured into my Stone IRS snifter.
Appearance: Pours an absolute pitch black like a black hole with a nice 3/4 fingers worth of dark tan/brown head that leaves little lacing that eventually dissipates.
Smell: Bourbon, coffee, chocolate, molasses, and roasted malts are dominant with mild hints of oak in the background. All of these come together very well and balanced now. I remember the first time I had it fresh and it was hot from the bourbon.
Taste: IRS are one of my two favorite styles and this beer is why. Rich and earthy bittersweet chocolates meld together into flavors of oak, vanilla, bourbon, coffee, a little anise, and smooth roasted malts. Great earthy mild hop presence supports the malt while allowing all the complexity to come through, adding a gentle to moderate bitterness in the finish. Really has aged to perfection and the blending and complexity that has taken place with age has done wonders. Perfection!
Mouthfeel: Full bodied with thick, creamy, velvety texture. With the light moderate carbonation level that is typical of the style. This is dangerously drinkable. Had the whole bottle easily by myself.
Overall: This beer speaks for itself. 1,200 charactersSoCalStout, Feb 17, 2012

A. Pours a deep dark black, 1mm of rich full head, takes a minute to work it's way down to a thin layer, finally settling at a nice thick ring.
S. Smells of dark chocolate, slight toffee and heavy oak tones with slight vanilla.
T. Tastes of dark chocolate, heavy malts, tobacco, and smoked oak.
M. Heavy body, super thick and chewy, lower carbonation, slightly coarse finish.
O. A great beer. This is really a beer that tastes it's best around 55 degrees. It's not nearly as good when cold. Lots of bold flavors in a thick and hearty drink. A great beer that gets even better with age. And really hard to beat at $13/bottle. Worth searching out. 712 charactersMBrausen, Feb 15, 2012

Thanks to Jebus3513 for sharing this one!
This guy pours an opaque ink black. The head was small, brown in color, and seemed to refresh itself a little every time I swirled. Not much in the lines of lace, just some dots strewn about.
Bold, assertive nose of licorice, molasses, burnt roast, bourbon soaked cherries, some bittersweet chocolate and a touch of vanilla.
The licorice, molasses and general roastiness are the most prominent on the palate. The bourbon steps up a bit in the finish to leave a bit of boozey, ethanol lingering with chocolate, vanilla, dry oak, and sweetness from the licorice flavors.
Viscous, full body. Huge. Smooth yet oily, a little unrefined. I like that in my stouts from time to time.
This is a big, bad stout; full and robust flavors. A tad on the sweet side compared to its brethren, but nothing cloying or overwhelming. 895 charactersColForbinBC, Feb 14, 2012

Poured a bit below cellar temperature into a snifter. Reveals a jet black body with a small khaki collar. Appears highly viscous and creamy. 
Nose is an unbelievably complex bouquet of toasted marshmallow, roasted wood, vanilla, and milk chocolate. Also getting a nice hint of sweet, cool, bourbon. 
I thought the taste wouldn't be able to follow up the insane wafts I was getting, but oh I was wrong. An explosion of vanilla and chocolate bark. Coffee grounds and espresso add bitterness and balance. Proceeds to hit you over the head with molasses, brown sugar, and a subtle licorice bite. Finishes with the most well integrated bourbon aging I have experienced. 
The feel is also perfect. Not too syrupy to be cloying, but full and rich enough to slickly coat the flavors onto your palate. Just enough carbonation for the style.
I've never given a beer a 5 before, but while consuming the Abyss, I wondered: how could this beer improve at all? The answer was: I don't know, in my eyes it can't. From the unbelievably complex nose, to its amazing depth and best-in-class balance of bold flavors, I would put this stout as the finest I have had. Absolutely seek this one out. 1,194 charactersDrewZ926, Feb 14, 2012

A-thin brown ring (I think the waiteress brought it quite a while after it had been poured) I expected a good foam after all the reviews. Yes, black as the Abyss, couldn't see through the glass

(everyone at the table tried it EVERYONE -even my wife the wine snob liked it)
M-CREAMY, only word I use. OK, smoooth works too
O-Not a Deschutes Brewery diehard (a couple of the seasonals I like), but this is one of the best Imperial Stouts out there (it ranks close to my favorite beer of all time Mephistopheles beer by Avery at least IMO) 782 charactersbrewmyster, Feb 07, 2012

Small hiss on the pop. Pours gluggy black into a snifter glass. Big two-and-half finger brown head. Huge bubbles on top. Looks rich. Sweet primary lacing clouds the glass.
Great first whiff! Oak, black licorice, port wine, obvious booze that lingers with a sweetness, big roasty black malt, other slightly sour vinous qualities, marzipan; hints of molasses, char, and smoke. Some tart cherry as it warms up. Top-notch complexity. One of the better smelling stouts I have had the opportunity to have.
Smoky focus. Huge roasty malt grains that have evolved and de-evolved into a peaking imperial stout. Some over-the-edge sourness. Transient char-roast coffee flavor that isn't predictable or palate-stealing. Soft alcoholic finish with a slowly receding bitterness. A powerful semi-dry imperial with a well-disguised booziness and delicate flavors of licorice and oak. Woodsy and well-established. A tribute to dark malts.
Feels medium-thick with a gluttonous mouth-glaze. Nice surprising carbonation that sneaks up on you, despite the overall low level of carbon dioxide. Chewy, but far from cloying. Superb.
The only thing that I'm curious about is whether this peaks in a year, and not two. Never had a fresher version. The slight acidity was a plus, but unexpected (at least, to say, that I don't remember reading about it in past reviews). No particular feature of this beer detracted from the overall experience of imbibing it. Love the style, and this one's incredibly balanced, distinct, and now easily recognizable. Will do what I can to land myself more bottles. 1,674 charactersthecheapies, Feb 04, 2012

a double with intense bittering hops. warrior possible that dry but mineral dry also. this beer has latitude with all the minimal contracting palate qualities but fundamental form. the bourbon hints best at cellar temperature. bitterness is actually quite dominant. nose is a bit booze and roasted with a bit of malt of bourbon. roasted coffee notes, hop dry, vanilla subtle. very subtle... but to say that this beer hides abv because of bourbon aging... or wood aging and hopping would be the primary grace. wouldn't say that there is a huge dynamic blend of flavors. for something so sought after it is its rather well made... but heavy handed in the subtle notes. 705 charactersrtepiak, Jan 31, 2012

Vintage Nov 2011 batch
Served Jan 21st 2012
A - Mean looking jet black in color with no light passing through the glass. Awesome 2 finger tan head with excellent head retention and good lacing. One of the best looking stouts out there.
S - Heavy molasses, raisin, roasted malts, chocolate, coffee, and a hint of licorice. Just a touch of alcohol could be smelled.
T - A backbone of roasted malt, chocolate, caramel. Extremely rich and full palate with a great balance of sweetness and bitterness, and just a bit more alcohol than I wanted as wasn't balanced by a minimal amount of hoppy flavor compared to the others. Just a minor critic given the awesomeness of this brew.
M - Very creamy and full body, moderate carbonation. Almost perfect.
O - Quite simple the best Imperial Stout and one of the best beers I have ever had. Enough said. 876 characterswilliamjbauer, Jan 30, 2012

This was a very impressive looking pour for an 11% stout. Deep, rich blackness. The head took a while to build, yet continued to hang around and refreshed everytime I swirled the glass. Bits of lace clung to the class, and thick legs held onto the sides.
Aromas mainly of alcohol and liquorice. Quite boozy. My friend smelled a lot of bourbon aromas, but I didn't notice them like he did.
The taste was excellent. Be sure to let this one warm up, as the flavors continued to improve all the way to the bottom. Hard to really pinpoint everything that was going on. Noticed the liquorice, some sweeter maltiness, some burnt sugar and some alcohol burn.
The mouthfeel was my favorite part of the beer. You could literally chew the beer before swallowing. Rich and velvety.
Overall, a very nice imperial stout. Not the best that I've had, but certainly a special beer. I think another year of aging would have been good on this, as it was stil quite hot after a year in the fridge. 996 charactersdoppelmeup, Jan 29, 2012

Aroma was so inviting. Chocolate, strong coffee, vanilla, so much going on, this was amazing. Taste is incredible. Chocolate, coffee, vanilla, molasses, caramel...so many sweet flavors and yet they still have the powerful flavors of a regular imperial stout. Says it is best aged, and it does get better, but it's also drinkable fresh. Mouthfeel goes down so easy, still very carbonated, but I can tell that this becomes better with age. Very viscous, and lingers well. This is incredibly drinkable. This is still easily in my top 3 of all time. Delicious, drinkable (and completely masking an 11 percent), and the favorite style of beer on this sight. I know this is a Winter Seasonal, and hard to get, but this is an amazing beer. Great great great imperial stout, everyone should try this at some point. 920 charactersSmurf2055, Jan 29, 2012
4.25/5  rDev -5.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Poured this one into my Brooklyn snifter and it is very deep in color and the head lingers for a good while. The nose is huge with toasted grains, dark chocolate and bit of burnt sugar. The tastes follows the nose but has a bit more of dark chocolate bite at the end. The sweetness is not over powering and seems to even out after the first sip washes over your tongue. I really enjoy the dryness on the aftertaste and at this point is pretty drinkable for the alc%.

I had a full bottle that was slightly chilled to about 50 degrees or so. Smell and tastes are deep. Taste really opened up as it warmed. Deep licorice tastes, really nice. A little pricey for what the market is currently bringing on this, but overall a really, really nice BAS (barrel aged stout)! 358 characters4thelvofbeer, Jan 29, 2012

A: Very thick beverage. Very dark color with a dark thick head which fades quickly.
S: Incredible nose. This is a true fall in the abysses. Complexity is extraordinary. Roasted, dark chocolate, dark fruits, soaked red fruits, bourbon, vanilla, sweet finish on bitter chocolate and caramel malts.
T: More incredible than the nose if possible. Roasted, toasted, dark chocolate, huge presence of the bourbon and the vanilla, fruity (same as the nose), wooden, finish on the bitter chocolate which settles very slowly on the long-term.
M: Skillful blend of sweetness, deepness, balance and length on the palate.
O: Tasted for dessert with a home-made brownie after a huge, massive dinner. This exceptional beer has been the icing on the cake of this evening. 773 charactersFux, Jan 29, 2012

4.36/5  rDev -2.7%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5For me, that's a perfect looking beer - steady, dark, monster head and like India ink below. The head sticks to the sides of the glass in clumps. 
Predominantly roasted - like having a front row seat to the mash itself. Everybody else seems to comment on chocolate, coffee and other scents - to me, it's all wound up in those dark grains. 
Like chewing on the grains themselves, this beer delivers them without measure. Roasted with licorice, I'd swear that it might actually roast the tongue with each drink. Being as high in ABV, it's very well hidden, only revealing itself before it comes to temperature. 
Thick, like they've blended a portion of the grains in prior to bottling, rather than filtered them out. Akin to chocolate milk, with a steady foundation and a hint of sweetness. 
Not for the faint of heart - this is a heavy drinker - one of the bigger Impy Stouts I've had. Some pepper on the tongue through the carbonation. A beer you can really drown into. A bottle will do you for the night though. 1,016 charactersmdcrouser, Jan 29, 2012

Smooth and warming.
Faint carbonation.

Pours the deep, viscous, black that I love in a good stout. Pour produces a surprisingly large brown sugar head that leaves some thin lacing as well as a thin cap. So much going on in the nose I really can't pick everything. What I can pick up is roasted malts, cocoa, and alcohol. Taste is a roasty, almost charred, flavor up front with molasses with a smooth milk chocolate finish. Also some faint licorice and hop notes throughout. Definitely full bodied with a clean finish, somehow feels a bit thinner than it is. A great brew, glad I hung onto it as long as I did, but now I'm sad I only have one. 682 charactersalli4051, Jan 29, 2012

From the tap at Uptown Brothers in Denver.
A - Perfect fit for an Imperial Stout. Nice creamy head and color.
S - Roasted barley, some chocolate and coffee noticeable. Not overpowering and very pleasing.
T - The server recommended letting the beer warm up a but before sampling to really bring out the full flavor but I couldn't resist. Slightly sweet but very favorable. Very easy to drink. The taste of chocolate malt lingers for and is quite tasty.
M - Rich and full. Very solid.
D - An excellent beer and if I didn't know better I would have thought it was lower in ABV due to how smooth it was and easy to drink. Very good.

A- Looks perfect; black with nice chocolate, brown head and nice lacing, leaving a thick, sticky residue of foamy head on the glass.
S-Delicious, definite hints of molassass/syrup, coffee, chocolate, bourbon and subtle hint of smoke (oak). Because of the large bottle, the second glass definitely had a nicer aroma as the beer warmed a bit. But light to the nose, expected a little bit more?!
T-The taste is lighter than it looks and lighter than expected. I've always heard about the licorice with this beer, and I was hesitant to try because I absolutely hate black licorice, but I did not notice licorice at all. The taste was very smooth, nice mild carbonation, and a nice crisp finish, with no heavy alcohol on the back side. At 11%, you the alcohol blended very well. 
M-The texture of the beer is nice also with the light carbonation and the flavor carrying over in the aftertaste and not the alcohol. 
Overall, the is a delicious beer, but I honestly don't think it is a 100 beer, but definitely a mid-90's; a 95/96! I am torn between my favorite stout, the Goose Island Bourbon County and this; very comparable!
I have a CBS that I have just acquired and can't wait to compare between the top 3 I. Stouts of my U.S. 1,324 charactersmtbdonn, Jan 28, 2012

This ale is long, round and velvety. It's easy to find tobaco, coffee, smoke and a hop finale that taste like dust. The rostiness of the malt brings out good flavor. Not an easy drinking beer, it's a sipping beer to share with friends. 528 charactersrodenbach99, Jan 27, 2012

Pour black as used motor oil, with a nice dark fudge colored head about two finger width and it remains for a little while. The nose has settled on this one the chocolate is subtle along with coffee, oak/bourbon, and dark fruits. The flavors have mellowed and came together extremely well no one flavor comes right out all of them are subtle when this was fresh the chocolate and coffee were the first two flavors and the lingered on your palette. Now those flavors have settled and the oak/bourbon and roasted malt have came through more and more with age. The mouthfeel is wonder nice and creamy with good carbonation and has thinned a little with age. Over all this is one of the best aged beers that I have ever had.
I had four botles of this and every year I have cracked one sadly this was the last '08 but I would have to say every year this beer has gotten better and better with age. Now I am going to cry a little bit that I don't have any left in my cellar. 997 charactersphisigben, Jan 25, 2012

3.97/5  rDev -11.4%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Just received a batch of 2011 Abyss from a great trading partner: Johngalt1. We decided that we wanted to review a bottle of 2011 fresh and compare with fresh notes from last years. I had to mark this serving type as a 'can' as, for whatever reason, I can't review a different vintage with the same serving type.
Appearance aside, this really smells and tastes like a completely different beer. High SRM but not quite black. This really borders on coffee black than true black with plenty of ruby around the edges. Low, but evident carbonation, makes a small 1/4" head that quickly fades.
First impressions of the aroma are caught up in roast and chocolate malts. Very fudgey while chilled, more wine-like aromas come up as Abyss creeps towards room temperature. I smell delicate white wine and chardonnay. This has much more oak in the bouquet than the 2010 did. No fruity aromas like the previous year, a bit of fruit comes out in the flavor. Oaked white wine and baker's chocolate are centerstage in the flavor. Very simple on the tongue. Earthy hops. Smooth mouthfeel. Velvety.
All in all, this is still a fantastic beer but logic tells me that the recipe has changed... Can this even be the case? Oak and wine are much more prevalent whereas fruitiness is mostly absent. It'll be nice to do a vertical soon. 1,315 charactersseedsofchaos, Jan 24, 2012

Score: 87
November 2011 vintage bottle -- best after 08/04/12 -- served in a Surly Darkness snifter and enjoyed on 01/22/12. I have three of these bottles so I'd figured I'd have one relatively fresh, one at the "best after" date, and one a year after that.
Appearance: Pours a completely opaque, pitch black color with two full fingers of foamy dark tan head that settles into a thin layer across the top of the glass. Amazing lacing -- as the head settles, it leaves a thick, sticky residue of foamy head on the side of the glass. 5/5
Smell: Creamy milk chocolate, roasted chocolate and coffee prominently featured. Roasted malts, light brown sugar, light cherry and some vanilla complement the coffee/chocolate aromas. There is a light anise (black licorice) aroma, mixed with hints of alcohol, in the background. If you swirl the beer, the creamy chocolate aromas exponentially increase. As it warms, more cherry notes come out in addition to a hint of dark berries towards the back end of the nose. 4/5
Taste: Creamy bittersweet chocolate and roasted coffee upfront. Some dark licorice and "dark cherry" on the midpalate. Very light notes of dark berries towards the finish. Finish is quite coffee heavy. Not getting a whole lot of barrel characteristics, though there are hints of oak and vanilla at points as the beer layers. 3.5/5
Mouthfeel: Medium-full bodied, minimal carbonation. Creamy mouthfeel. Finish is bitter and slightly acidic. 4/5
Overall: A solid, but nothing special imperial stout when drank relatively fresh. The bottle implores you to wait nearly a year after picking it up before drinking it, so it will be interesting to see how this one improves with age. Certainly an interesting beer to seek out, but I'd recommend aging this one rather than drinking it fresh. Not because I know how it'll age, but rather based on reputation. As it drinks fresh, it is not worth going out of your way to seek out.
Recommendation: Age this one. It does not live up to its hype -- at least not when drank fresh.
Pairings: Steak.

A: Black viscous liquid. Forms a decent sized dark brown head that has poor retention and leaves little lacing. The '09 and '10 appear to be flat. The '11 has the best retention of the bunch, leaving a thin surface coating of head on the beer. 
S: The '09 smells of roasted malts with a slight vinous or green apple quality. However, for being infected, the taste is not off putting or unappealing. Just different. The '10 is full of roasted malts and chocolate with some mild vanilla notes. The '11 is full on roasted malts, cocoa, chocolate, and a bit of char. The aroma of the '11 is much more aggressive and pronounced. 
T: The '09 has a mild sourness to it, much like cheap coffee, but the dark malts and chocolate dominate. The '10 has none of the coffee sourness, but has stronger coffee flavors. Chocolate, cocoa, roasted malts and roasted coffee. Again, the '11 is the most aggressive of the bunch with a strong dry cocoa quality and lots and lots of roasted malts. 
M: Meduim to heavy bodied with a mild bitterness and a creamy finish. 
O: A very good Imperial Stout. '09 wasn't as bad as I was expecting it to be - only slightly off, but really still quite drinkable. The '10 was the best of the bunch while the '11 needs to sit for a while to let the rough edges smooth out. 1,310 charactersFlorida9, Jan 22, 2012

A - Pours pitch black with two fingers of brown head. Head has decent retention but leaves only spotty lacing.

A: One-finger tan head. Jet black. Nice lacing. Exactly what you’d expect an imperial stout to look like.
S: In the best way, this is like every imperial stout I’ve had to date in one glass. Coffee, chocolate, licorice, oak, bourbon, molasses. Smells delicious.
T: Everything from the nose comes through here, and no single flavor dominates. Very well balanced. The alcohol really doesn’t come through at all here.
M: Full-bodied with a smooth, creamy mouthfeel. Just right for an imperial stout.
D: This one has finesse that most other imperial stouts lack. A great balance of big flavors and subtlety. If you can find this one, you shouldn’t hesitate to pick it up, especially considering the moderate price. 850 charactersschlimenhaumer, Jan 21, 2012

Smells of chocolate, toffee, raisins, liquorish, burnt espresso, vanilla and a sweet cherry aroma. Very complex and multi layered. 
In the mouth there is an initial sour/sweet taste followed by heavy chocolate notes finishing with sweetness and a slight hop bitter bite. This tastes like a chocolate barleywine to me. The sweet/sour makes it very juicy. This is one tasty stout! 546 charactersBarleyWineRox, Jan 21, 2012

N: very complex nose: I get some dark chocolate, roasty malts, oak, plumb, and coffee notes. Very good.
T: also very complex. Starts a little sweet with some oaky molasses, then becomes a little bitter like coffee malts, and finishes almost tart but with a nice stout coffee-like aftertaste. Wow!
M: very good carbonation for a barrel ager. Overall pretty smooth but does have a bit of crispness from the 11%, however not harsh or overly hot.
O: Wow, this is probably the best stout I've tasted. It is extremely complex. I look forward very much to having it aged. Biggest surprise was the amount of up-front oak. Favorite aspect is the complex nose (am going to spend some time just sniffing this one). Cheers. 911 charactersbeerbiatchMD, Jan 16, 2012

I am probably not using the right kind of glass, and didn't do such a great pour. Still, one of the darkest, thick milk chocolate brown heads I've ever seen. The beer is as dark as a moonless Northwest winter evening. The molasses, licorice and vanilla advertised on the label are instantly recognizable in the smell, oak is right there as well. I find it really interesting that it's made with 3 different types of barrel aging, oak, oak bourbon and oak wine barrels. I'm going to let it warm a bit before scoring it.
The taste is soooo yuuuummm. Hard to believe it's 11%! Intensely flavorful, but not overpowering. The label says "Best after 8/4/12" ... I can't wait that long! A lot hoppier than I would have thought from the smell. With the licorice and molasses, a sweet smell, but big, bitter hoppy goodness slowly leads to a nice maltiness. Big chewy mouthfeel but a crisp clean finish. 
This is my first review in a long time, just stopped doing it for a while. Really surprised to see drinkability replaced by overall!!! Totally makes sense though. That's always what was meant by drinkability, in my opinion, but many people had different takes on it. Overall, I would say Deschutes can do no wrong, and The Abyss is a perfect stout. 1,349 charactersdavidchollar, Jan 15, 2012

What a stout. Hands down my favorite. Roast, chocolate, vanilla dominate the aroma. The presentation is beautiful. Thick 3-finger khaki head with tight carbonation bubbles. The taste is out of this world. Molasses, chocolate, more molasses, coffee, more chocolate, roastiness, mild sweetness...so many good things, repeated over and over.

Penetrating and deep. This is an encyclopedia of the very best vanilla/chocolate/coffee flavors that deepen as it warms. Hints of beef bouliion, gingersnaps, and cocoa. Lots of depth. 
Silky smooth texture. Almost too easy to drink this. 
A femme fatale who kills you slowly. And you like it. 
Top O' the heap. This really is my ultra-uber favorite right now because it has lenghtning flavors that are like a Willy Wonka everlasting gobstopper- new flavors and nuances just keep popping up, retreat, and popping up again.

Appearance: Pours a superior jet black, head is about 1/3" like a dark tan right off the body. Not too bubbly settles within the first sip. 
Smell: comes off a bit of dark chocolate and molasses. I wish I could rate it more but it goes into your nostrils as quick as it leaves. In all seriously it still smells great. 
Taste: Not so overly complex hints of molasses and incredible dark chocolate. This flavor is so intense but so smooth that it leaves you wanting for more. 
Mouth: Medium carbonation, very easy to drink and easily fall in lust with. 
Overall: I seriously took my time drinking this diamond in the rough, I say that because this beer is extremely rare here in NY and it is one of my top beers PERIOD! It is definitely well crafted and beautifully put together. If you see it buy it, you will thank me later flavor so potent that it hugs your cheeks. Salud! 941 charactersBlurryVisi0n, Jan 10, 2012

The nitro was the most memorable but in no way demeans the beer I had on-tap. Poured dark of course into a funny looking slender/tall glass.
Sipping it slow. Want it to last forever. Smooth. Flavors: what they said. No need to be repetitive. 
Can't say enough about this beer. Alcohol well hidden. No burn at all.

Smells like dark chocolate, coffee, a bit of leather, toasty grains, brown sugar, and a touch of tobacco. There aren't really any hops in the nose. Reminds me of an old oak cabin. The taste follows the nose with molasses up front, a nice balancing bitterness without any herbal hop flavors, and some extra black licorice in the background. I can't believe how well the booze is masked! This beer basically tastes like an old fashioned candy store tour; licorice, molasses, bitter chocolate, vanilla, and some stale coffee... no sugar or butter in sight : ) Sticky, thick, and somehow still dry without being astringent or burnt. This is amazingly smooth. I reckon anyone could get into this beer... there are none of the burnt, raisiny, sugary, boozy, or overly oaky flavors that non-stout drinkers usually poo-poo in stouts. 896 charactersJimmyTango, Jan 08, 2012

Reviewed live. I had this on tap recently, less than a month ago - and I liked it. Let's see how she holds up when I have a higher volume and more time. Purchased at an off-license adjacent a Whole Foods in Colorado. Cost was 10.99 USD. 
A: Pours a half finger head of tan colour, good cream, good thickness, and decent retention considering the ABV. Colour is a solid nontransparent black. 
Sm: Rich chocolate, caramel, nuts, wonderful cream, vanilla, toffee, and light roast. Rich and decadent. Exquisite. A moderate strength aroma. Definitely a pleasant and inviting one. I can't wait to sip this. 
T: Exquisite rich cream on the open, with a consistent chocolate tone throughout. Creamy and brilliant. The roast is a bit understated, but nevertheless enjoyable. It's quite cocoa-y. No coffee is present, except in perchance the finish, where it adds yet another layer of complexity. Exquisitely balanced. The caramel is just about perfect for the flavour profile - not over or understated. The nuts from the aroma never seem to make an entrance, but I think this is a good thing. Some vanilla. Heavy toffee. The alcohol doesn't come through. Most prominent - let me emphasize - is the richness of the flavours, predominantly chocolate and cream. It's really damn good. 
When I look for them, I find the oak and bark notes, but they're rather subtle - which was definitely the right approach. 
I don't detect molasses or licorice. Just sayin'. 
Mf: Delicately smooth and incredibly delightful. Quite creamy - to its benefit - and wet. Near perfect. Not too thick or too thin. 
Dr: Very drinkable for the ABV (and even the style). It's a notch above even most beers in the style. They went the distance for this one.

I've copied my original on-draught review below; it was removed from the site during the duplicate serving type review. My current 4.28 rating reflects the bottle review above, not this tap review, but I thought the additional notes might be of use. The review was dated 12/11/11, but I can't remember exactly when I actually took the notes. 
Served on-draught into a 5 oz sampler glass in Orange, California. This was the 2011 vintage. Expectations were wildy high due to its reputation. Reviewed from notes. I don't recall the price. 
A: Pours a half finger tan colour head of nice cream and good thickness. The retention is bad - attributable no doubt to the high ABV. Colour is a solid black. 
Sm: Chocolate, toffee, coffee, nuts, cream, and caramel. A mild strength aroma. 
T: Chocolate/toffee form the flavour base alongside the subtle roasted malt foundation, with coffee and caramel atop and about. Fantastically milky - which I didn't expect. Perhaps cream is a better descriptor, but it isn't so in the Bailey's sense. Very complex without compromising its balance. Quite rich. Wonderful. Built very well. Bravo. 
Mf: Smooth, creamy, and wet. Suits the flavour quite well. Not too thick or thin. 
Dr: Highly drinkable; very rich and complex. I wish it were more available. It's marvellous on tap. I'd have it again.

B+

11.02.15: Brief impressions for a 2014 vintage (Best before 8 days from now):
Pours a gorgeous silky head of tan colour. Retention is superb. Body is a predictable black.
Aroma brings the cherry bark to the fore, with subtle hints of caramel and chocolate. There's no overt oak or vanilla, and this is nowhere near as complex as I remember.
Taste brings decadent cherry bark, rich dry chocolate/cacao nibs, a hint of licorice/anise (not a flavour I adore), and cream. No oak or vanilla really comes through, but I do get a hint of port/dessert red wine. It's balanced, sure, with an aptly subtly dry and coarse mouthfeel, past vintages have been far more intricate and subtly executed. Still, the cherry bark is amazing, and this is well-balanced. Texture is creamy, but could be softer. Carbonation is perfect.
This isn't my favourite vintage, and I do think this beer has gone steadily downhill since about 2010, but it's well worth trying even at its high price point. Formerly, this was the one beer I'd always buy multiple bottles of every year. Now, I think I'll be scaling back.

Thanks to Manny for bringing me by a rather wonderful Whole Foods in Chandler. I had a 12oz. pour in a wonderful looking goblet and from first sight I was impressed. It was very brown almost black with a delcious looking and smelling short tan head that stuck around. It was malty, sweet, and just a bit hot; all in very good ways. Each sip was delicious and it wnet quite well with the sushi I had. Vanilla, chocolate and dark fruits were the predominant flavors along with a bit of Oak. Very nice mouthfeel, but it could have been a bit heavier and the bottled version might be just that. This is gonna be one I keep eyes out for in the future, because it is just that good. 802 charactersunclejazz, Jan 05, 2012

A - Pitch black body. Dark brown 2 finger head. Tons of sticky lacing and crazy retention.
S - Lots of roasty and oak aromas. Tobacco, smoke, leather, licorice, chocolate and some vanilla. More savory than sweet. There is a certain aroma that is rather dominant but I can't put a name to it. Perhaps its the cheery wood?
T - Very complex stout. Chocolate and coffee notes followed by some licorice, vanilla, and heavy roast flavors. The oak aging is present as well. Nice medium mouth feel that supports these huge flavors. Alcohol is warming but pleasant.

A- Pure black, seeing absolutely nothing through this beer. Nice brown colored head forms upon pouring which coats the glass, and some lacing is evident on the sides of the glass. 
S- Coffee, chocolate, maybe even some vanilla in there. The oakiness is apparent, as is a bit of an alcohol bite.
T- Lots going on with this. Starts off smooth, with hints of coffee. At the back of the taste the oak aging hits you, with a definite warming alcohol feeling. There's so many other things going on here that I can't really pinpoint on. 
M- Heavy, a sipper for sure. High alcohol content was apparent for me.
The Abyss is unlike any beer I've had. I wish I could describe it but can't. I hope to trade for some more in the future. 895 charactersvic21234, Jan 03, 2012

First beer of 2012, which barring unforeseen disaster will most likely be one of the best years of my life so far. Cheers!
Pours pure black- darker than used engine oil. When I hold his up to the bright sun there are no highlights revealed. I mean this is totally black. The pour produces two fingers of doughy dark brown compact head that coats the glass. Looks awesome!
The nose is one of the most complex of any dark beer I have smelled in quite some time. A touch of smoke overlays a duo of roasty malt and hops. A further hoppiness pairs with tannic notes of woody oak. A slight touch of vanilla is probably due to the added vanilla and not bourbon barrel (only 6% of the beer in this bottles ever saw the inside of one) but then who know? Maybe it was a young set of barrels.
Well this beer is complex. I guess I will start with the basic stout flavors, which are present in this beer but there is so much happening on top of them that I have to think about it to isolate them. Hops are here in plentiful quantities and they pair with the roast of the dark malts in the typical big stout fashion. The most prominent non-traditional stout flavor is a pronounced woodiness. It almost reminds me of roasted chicory, or an over-oaked stout stout I brewed once. Anyway, this flavor almost dominates, but doesn't eclipse everything else. I do taste both licorice and a tiny bit of vanilla, which are both tasty. So I wonder if that particular woody flavor is the cherry bark? 
The mouthfeel is rather dry and viscous, but not as thick and chewy as something like Bourbon County Stout. I think it is quite good, and I imagine that it is exactly what the brewers at Deschutes intended. Carbonation feels fairly low. 
Conclusion: As expected, this is an awesome beer. It has so much flavor that it is walking the line between complex and muddled. I like it quite a bit, but find myself straying back the the purist mindset of doing little to a beer save for aging it in oak. However, this beer is doing something awesome and should be tried by anybody who has an interest in American beer or big dark beers of any sort. 2,235 charactersallforbetterbeer, Jan 02, 2012

Vintage 2010- served at about 48 degrees.
Abyss pours a dark-as-night color. There is not one sliver of light that gets through this beer. The head was impressive- about 1 inch of brown toasty marshmallow fluff head. Honestly one of the most beautiful beers I have ever seen.
Smell is so complex that you have to sniff time and time again to get them all- and I probably missed many. Some of the highlights are: anise, cherry, oak, chocolate, and coffee. Superb.
As for the taste. I will keep my comments limited, since I don't have three days to type this. Initial taste was a bourbon/vanilla flavor. I was impressed how each the flavors permeated so clearly with each sip. Then comes the cherry and licorice flavors. WOW. I enjoyed this with a stogie and man were they meant to be together. The smoothness of this beer is unmatched to date for me. 
Keep some in your cellar for another year, drink some now, and buy 2011 for consumption next year!!!!

Appearance: Pours pretty much completely black with a moderate amount of rising bubbles. Has a good two fingers of deep tan head that settles into a thin tan layer. Some pretty good lacing going on. 
Smell: Really complex and interesting. Dark roasted caramel malts with good hints of chocolate, coffee, and anise. Has some molasses and vanilla. Also some hints of bourbon and oak with a subtle blend of dark fruits including dark cherries, plums, and figs. 
Taste: Complex and very tasty. Big roasty caramel malts with some chocolate and coffee up front are followed by molasses, vanilla, and a bit of anise. Some hints of oak chips and bourbon. Also a pretty noticeable taste of sweet dark fruits with notes of dark cherries, fig, and plum. I'm also picking up a little bit of hop bitterness towards the finish. Very good. 
Mouthfeel: Full thick body with a low to medium level of carbonation. Somewhat sticky. Very smooth for such a high abv.

A: Pours black as used motor oil with ample 2.5 to 3 finger head. As head dissipates beer is leaving amazing sponge cake like lacing down the edges of the glass.
S: First impression is soy sauce but can also pick up some burnt coffee like malt.
T: First hit with deep wood smoke flavor then the soy sauce with a dark chocolate finish. 
M: The alcohol is hidden almost completely by these complex flavors but after a few sips I can feel the alc. warmth in tummy. Carbonation is medium. Finishes a bit oily on the tongue.
O: Wow! I love how the different flavors come to you in stages from the wood to the soy sauce then the chocolate. Reminds me of the gum that violet ate in willy wonka. The aging has really mellowed this beer out nicely. Top 3 imp. stout in my opinion. 810 charactersBeerdregs, Jan 01, 2012

All years are very dark, with short-lived moderate head ranging from tan to brown. My notes for each vintage:
07 - Rich and smooth, holding up really well. Strikes an excellent balance of chocolate, coffee, and licorice. Booziest of the group.
08 - Lots of roasty coffee, and the strongest licorice flavor of the group.
09 - This bottle was mildly infected which added an interesting tart cherry aspect. Not undrinkable in the way some people have described severely infected bottles. Some people at our tasting actually preferred this over all the others, although personally I'm not sure I'd want to drink a whole bottle of it.
10 - Chocolate dominates in this vintage, and this has the creamiest mouthfeel, although it's not quite as deliciously milk-chocolatey as I remember when it was just released. Paired really nicely with some aged gouda we had.
11 - Cacao. Similar to the '10, but thinner and drier, not as creamy.
My personal ranking of the vintages would be 07; 08,10(tied); 11. Leaving the 09 out since that will vary substantially on whether and how infected a given bottle is. (FWIW, a bottle I opened a month ago was completely un-infected.) 1,192 characterskscaldef, Dec 31, 2011

4.18/5  rDev -6.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5On tap at Deschutes pub in Portland, OR. I talked to the brewer; he mentioned that it was currently around 8 months old, and had been aged in bourbon barrels, pinot barrels, and Oregon oak.
Tan head, *black* body. Some lace.
Big malty nose, roasty, almost charred. More booze as it warms I'd still advise against letting it get too warm, but some bourbon emerges as it warms even more.
Malt, significant chocolate, and licorice hops towards the end. Balanced, but with a good bite. Age might tame this even more to my tastes, but that's a personal preference that will certainly vary. Think an old fashioned chocolate malt/shake with hops; it's darn good as is. A bit of maple as it warms more.
Bright feel for a stout, it accentuates flavor and kick, then descends into creaminess. Out of curiosity, I also tasted this on nitro, for comparison (since I didn't have a great first impression from the bottle). Nitro makes this way too creamy, like milk hit with a milk frother. Steals the taste. Don't do it on nitro.
Worth the hype. Chocolate, licorice, sweet, bitter, everything it ought to be. 1,100 characterszaphodchak, Dec 31, 2011

A: Pours a deep, viscous black. No light getting through. Mocha colored 1 finger head. Lacing is fairly attractive, seems sticky. Some great patterns sticking to the side of the glass as the beer progresses. More of a dark brown color near the edge of the glass, some light getting through.
N: I'm not getting a big nose here. Some real subtle notes of vanilla, molasses, dark chocolate, some mild bourbon, and roasted malt. It really isn't prominent, I'm surprised. 
T: The taste is 100% fine! Some mild bourbon on the front end, quickly overshadowed by a forceful wave of roasted malt and molasses. Sheets of licorice, caramel, vanilla, and oak follow. The bourbon really hits a nice warming note on the back of the tongue towards the end. 
M: Very inviting. Viscous, but not cloying. Some sweetness, counteracted with bitter dark chocolate. Creamy texture. 
D and O: Sooo, what does the 33% that is straight from the wood taste like is what I want to know? This is a tasty brew, 3rd bottle I have sampled, but never appreciated it until now. Thought it was a good moment for a formal review. Very well balanced, and I do enjoy the licorice for a bit of drying and bitterness. 1,295 charactersMarcatGSB, Dec 30, 2011

A: Do I even need to write this? Jet black body with a fluffy, two finger dark khaki colored head that has great retention that leaves minimal lace and heavy brown legs.
S: Very rich in the nose, but delicious. Molasses and licorice are there for the sweet presence and it is brought down to earth by the dark fruits and chocolate. Very minimal oak hovers in the background.
T: Wonderful. The oak shines through more in the taste than the nose. Dark fruits, bitter baker's chocolate and some cocoa nibs are all present. Subtle coffee flavors peek up every now and then. The partial barrel flavors are wonderfully integrated and sit in the background. The very subtle bourbon just gives this beer another layer of flavor that is great.
M: Icredibly smooth and cream with a nice heavy body. Just enough carbonation to play with the palate, but not completely destroy it. Delicious chocolates and subtle oak linger long after the drink is consumed.
O: Well this is damn good. Very complex and the mouthfeel is spot on for the style. I've got a 2011 waiting in the wings for another special occasion. 1,229 charactersTreebs, Dec 27, 2011

Opened 12/26/11 to share with my father and brother in law for Christmas.
Apperance: Midnight black with nice dark tan head that lasts just a few seconds.
Smell: Absolutly wonderful. Big bourbon notes and big molasses, which I love.
Taste: It was still a bit cool on the first sip, but, still got the bourbon, licorice, and molasses and as it warmed the alcohol really came through in a very good way. Picked up a few coffee notes as well.
Mouthfeel: Nice and thick, not quite a thick as Ten Fidy, but excellent just the same
Overall: I got 3 bottles of 2010 vintage from a friend last year at Christmas. Had a terrible cold last year during the tasting and could not do this awesome beer justice. I was 100% this year and loved it! Even my brother in law, who is not a stout fan, said it was one of the best beers he has ever had! It definently lives up to all the hype. 890 charactersLemmyRamone, Dec 27, 2011

Pours a pitch black with a big dark, tan head.
Smells of toast/bread and roasted malt with notes of molasses and licorice with hints of caramel and bourbon. 
Taste is bourbon and molasses up front that blend with licorice and chocolate and coffee. There are notes of oak and vanilla in the middle with a coffee/oak/chocolate finish that lasts for ages. Complex and so smooth. Still, I bet another year would do wonders. The licorice stands out.
Heavy body with lower carbonation are perfect for the style, smooth, and warming with alcohol.
This is such an interesting and complex beer but smooth and not too harsh in any way. Great all around. 681 charactersTenHornsProud, Dec 26, 2011

A: Pours a dark, jet black color with a light brown head. Very little lacing that dissipates very quickly.
S: Rich aroma of molasses, licorice cherry, and hints of burnt vanilla. I sensed oak and some roasted smoky malts.
T: Tastes very similar to the smell. Licorice overwhelms the palate at first but as the beer warms the sweet molasses overtakes the beer and mellows to a bittersweet after taste. 
M: Definitely full bodied and as it warms it gets smoother. Hardly can tell that this is 11.0 ABV.
O: This is as close to beer nirvana as you can get. Truly an American classic and a definite yearly get IMO. 670 charactersFinatic, Dec 26, 2011

A: Dark as they come..completely opaque. Finger or so of frothy mocha head...lots of spotty lacing and thick film.
S: This has a pretty sweet smell. Chocolate, licorice, roasted malts. Hard to put my finger on it, but this has a very savory smell.
T: Not as sweet as the smell...more balanced. Nice roasted flavors with chocolate, licorice, light vanilla, oak...just a little bit of bite from the alcohol.
M: Incredibly thick, chewy and rich. Perfect.
O: This beer certainly deserves the hype and is nearly perfect. Having had the 09 and 10 vintages last week at a tasting, I'd say this falls between the two...2010 being the best. Excellent beer that I look forward to having again. 745 characterstitosupertramp, Dec 26, 2011

Smell: espresso, a hint of anise, some oak, some char.
Taste: Creamy roasted malt, almost a bit of burnt flavor but not enough to call it a defect. Flavor of licorice runs throughout. Sweetness is rounded by some dark fruit, chocolate-- accented with just a bit of harsh "coffee-like" bitterness.
Super thick, syrupy, and chewy mouthfeel.
As good a stout as can be without being the best. It has all the great qualities one would hope for in a premium Imperial stout, just a hair too much licorice flavor for me to call it my favorite. 747 charactersKBomb, Dec 25, 2011

Was initially hard to pull much aroma, but as it warmed up the boquet of wisky and dark chocolate came out.
I could taste some dark fruit, but cherry really came out with light coffe and chocolate hints. I really milked the pour to allow other flavors to come out as it warmed up- and was not dissapointed. I was expecting quite a bit going in and was very satisfied. 618 charactersGlibber, Dec 25, 2011

2011 Reserve
A: Pours an opaque pitch black, with just under 1 finger’s width of dark espresso colored head, which quickly dissipates down to leave only an outer ring. Leaves a trace amount of spotty lacing. 
S: So many aromas; I detect coffee, anise, cherry, bakers chocolate, and black licorice. There are also scents of oak, whiskey, roasted malt, a smoky character, and an alcohol presence to round it out. The whiskey and cherry aromas become especially prominent with a good swirl of the snifter. There are so many distinct flavors yet they all meld together very nicely. 
T: Similar to the nose, the flavor profile is complex and delicious. It is a little bitter at first, but as it warms that quickly subsides and the other flavors really come out. Throughout the drink I pick up anise, oak, roasted malt, a big chocolate flavor and bold roast black coffee. There are also more subtle hints of vanilla, toffee, chicory, alcohol, and a faint whiskey flavor that only reveals itself as one of the many flavors present in a long lingering aftertaste. It has a complex flavor profile with an excellent balance and multiple flavor levels with each sip. A+. 
M/D: Very chewy mouthfeel. Full bodied, relatively smooth with low to moderate carbonation. There is an alcohol presence but not to the degree that it reduces drinkability. Gets smoother as it inches closer to warm temperature. Surprisingly easy to drink considering the ABV, full body, and big flavor profile. 
O: Overall, a fantastic brew. Nice on the nose, with a great palate profile. Plus it only gets better as it warms. A+ for the finest imperial stout I have had to date. 1,682 characterszac16125, Dec 23, 2011

A-Pitch black. To the depths of the sea and like the midnight sky. Really nice and sweet mocha head that stays for a while. Head is abou two fingers and doesnt draw fast. 
S-Without a doubt you get tons of cherry and chocolate. The wine and bourbon sit still and make its way up. The molasses creeps up and is present. Somewhat sweet and nice.
T-With your first pour your gonna get tons of sweet cherry and chocolate notes. Its flavorfull and dark at the same time. Alchohol is diminished by the wine hints and oak wood. Very nice.
M-Really nice fully bodied beer. Very mellow and a solid mouthfull. Tons of flavor and very complex with so many angels. Carbonation is sweet and just and alcohol is present but subtle. 
O-A very good beer. Not as much chocolate as you would think but the cherry and wine finish nice. Good balance and complex flavors finsh easily and make a nice finish. Draw is sweet with a stale and bitter end. A really good beer 1,101 charactersales4baldo, Dec 22, 2011

S. very sweet. Molasses, vanilla, and chocolate come through the most upon intial smell.
T- Similar to smell the beer starts out with a very sweet mouth. Initally i get vanilla and molasse. That fades to more roasty flavors of chocalate and some burnt wood. At the end is when you begin to taste the barel aged flavors and the fades to a slight hoppy finish. The barel aged flavors are very finite and blend to a point where they are hard to point out. If anything the oaky wood is the most present. 
M- Thick as it should be. Not overbearing, but allows the beer to linger in your mouth after swallowing enough to get all flavors. Leaves good lacing on the glass.

Pours like motor oil. Pitch black with barely any head to speak of. 
Smell is rather sweet. uh oh. Roasty malts are there somewhere and covered up by sweet cherries and sugar.
Taste is beautiful. Its roasty and smokey, very smokey at first. The malt is thick and sweet (exactly like an RIS should be). After the initial roasted malts subside, the subtle flavors come through nicely. In no particular order, I get vanilla, cherries, oak, bourbon, and licorice. Whats nice is all the flavors are still there after about 10 seconds. Probably the best beer in terms of mouthfeel I have ever had. The oak barrels are almost an after thought, but add a nice finish on what would be a very sweet, almost dubbel like beer.

Rich smell of molasses, roasted malt and burnt wood.
The taste is a ride in the following order: malt, milk, burnt malt, alcohol heat, whiskey burn at the end. Amazing. Each taste blends with the next in a wonderful experience.
A crisper texture with a little cream to it. Almost no carbonation. 
One of the most enjoyable of the imperial/barreled style that I have had. Great smell and taste without being a burden to drink. 571 charactersFatehunter, Dec 17, 2011

A: Dark and foreboding, like a cold winter night. Nice and thick, and it almost seems to suck the light from the room. Light brown head which fades but leaves a distinct lacing. 
S: Roasted malts, coffee, with some faint notes of bourbon and oak.
T: Roasted malts and chocolate right away, with undertones of wood, vanilla, and bourbon. The high ABV is apparent in the flavor, but not overpowering. Overall a very smooth brew considering it's strength. Can catch you off guard.
M: Very thick, coats your mouth nicely. Finish is smooth and sweet with caramel making an appearance. 
O: A wonderful, wonderful beer. For an 11% imperial stout I can drink it and drink it and drink it. It's simply beautiful. Any lover of porters or stouts should try this. 783 charactersarcticstout, Dec 17, 2011

S - A touch of alcohol, lots of roasted malts mixed with sweet chocolate. A touch of leather is there as well.
T - Chocolate, lots of chocolate. Dark chocolate and a bit of coffee are absolutely dominant in this. Roasted malts round out the backbone, the leather is almost completely gone. I get a touch of whiskey, not too much, but it's there.
M - Thick heavy body. Coats the entire mouth with chocolate and hints of whiskey. Finish is where the whiskey and leather comes back. The finish is slightly sweet and sticky with hints of fading chocolate with bourbon and leather.
O - I had this infected before, and it was still good, but this is fantastic. Much more chocolate than I was anticipating, not as much bourbon, but still fantastic. 872 charactersGarrettMD, Dec 17, 2011

A: A thick jet black color that leaves no light through it. A small light brown head sits atop. Lacing is minimal.
S: Dark roasted smells with huge chocolate notes. Some espresso mixes in with a decent amount of woodiness. I get some sweet fruits with the sweet chocolate.
T: Massive dark chocolate flavors mix with some roasted malts and some espresso/coffee notes. The chocolate just keeps coming with some caramel sweetness that gets overtaken by the wood and smoke flavors. If I try, I gets some bourbon and vanilla from the barrels too. Just dark and dank, but oh so delicious. Alcohol creeps in on the finish but is totally welcomed. 
M: Full, coating, thick, some alcohol and nice carbonation for this thick of a stout. 
O: What else can I say. On tap this beer is just as great as in a bottle. This is a stellar barrel aged beer that does not punch you in the face with barrel aging. Great beer, award winning.
This was hear for Philly Beer Week and I wish we got it on a regular basis, hopefully soon. If I could get this and Black Butte, I would be totally happy. 1,286 charactersbravejoejoe, Dec 16, 2011

A: Pours pitch black with a thin mocha colored head. Little to no lacing. When there is little lacing it holds up pretty well.
S: Smells heavenly. I can smell the bourbon. I could smell the bourbon when I opened the bottle and I can smell the bourbon from a foot or two away after I poured it into the tulip.
T: Bourbon, dark chocolate, licorice. For some reason I also get chocolate orange flavor which is I like. 
MF: I get a lot of after flavors so it stays close to the stout name. This isn't a thin stout and I'm glad for it's complexity. 
O: This is still one of the best stouts out there 3 years later. I'm glad to see it hasn't gone down hill while sitting in my cellar and more thankful that this was a present. Now if only I can get some of the 2011 vintage. 939 charactersBigB415, Dec 16, 2011
4.76/5  rDev +6.2%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I can't believe I haven't reviewed this yet. I've had fresh and cellared of '09 and '10, and I almost missed this years too. Anyway, here's my thoughts on the 2011 version.
Pours out as black as the name. The head is deep tan and slow to surface. It disappears pretty quickly leaving no lace.
So far I like the smell of this years the best. Chocolate and molasses sweetness start it off. Oak and the wine barrel come through next. The hint of wine barrel really jazzes up the smell. Some earth and bourbon are noticeable near the end.
The taste has a nice heat to it. Semi sweet chocolate, charred coffee beans, molasses, oak dryness and slight grain lead off the taste. The licorice taste is more of a background note this year. The barrel notes (bourbon/wine) are right at the end, with a hint of hot cocoa. Sweet, but not cloying. Goes down so smooth it's crazy.
Another top notch year for The Abyss. Probably my favorite after the aged '09. 948 charactersOBeerMeGreatOne, Dec 15, 2011

Pours a thick-appearing viscous black capped with a dark brown head that recedes leaving very little to no lacing. Smell is rich black strap molasses, dark chocolate, vanilla, oak and a hint of coffee. Taste is initially a luxurious bitterness of dark chocolate and espresso intertwined with richly vanilla molasses, caramel and toffee sweetness. Oak appears mid palate along with a hint of anise. Finish is mildly bitter, dry and with subtle bourbon barrel elements except there's no hint of the 11% ABV. Mouthfeel is creamy, low carbonation, but slightly less thick that I would have liked.
Overall: richly complex and highly enjoyable. hype-worthy certainly. 678 charactersJackieTH, Dec 12, 2011

A: Pours viscous black with a thin layer of reddish brown head, receding quickly to a ring. A little lacing.
S: Roasted malt, a hint of vanilla and barrel (cinnamon), dried red fruit (cherry), rich dark chocolate, and some red white. Aromas meld wonderfully together. I get some hops that seem to disappear as the beer warms or opens up. The oak is quite present, but no bourbon is noticeable.
T: Malt and some hops, vanilla, red wine and barrel, melted, mouthcoating dark chocolate, with a lengthy finish with some hop bitterness.
M: Full bodied with light carbonation. Ultra smooth. No alcohol noticeable.
O: Tastes much more like a somewhat hoppy RIS (with some barrel characteristics) than I remember from past vintages (on tap). Not quite what I was expecting. Really solid for what it is, but I think some age will do wonders.
---
2007 vintage, tasted July 2013 to close out SoCal. Thanks to seeswo (I think) for sending this bottle ages ago. Not sure how well this will have held up. Let’s see.
Still has strong, roasty RIS character with black licorice, vanilla and cream. Wow, pretty potent. Slight to moderate signs of soy sauce in the nose, but few indications of oxidation on the palate. Barrel character is all but nonexistent. Overall, this has held up well enough, but it’s hardly improved. It’s on par with a slightly above average RIS.
---
2011 vintage: Opening this three years on (2014), it’s very dry and a lot of roastiness and cocoa come through.  Decent enough, I guess.  No signs of oxidation, but not a lot of complexity in the flavor. 1,601 characterspmarlowe, Dec 11, 2011

Definite molasses and dark chocolate in the flavour, with strong oak note, tempered by bourbon and winey notes. Nice coffee presence, light vanilla but not much cherry (though it does say cherry bark, which might contribute to the woody-ness). Bitter black coffee after taste.

Dark chocolate, coffee, mocha, vanilla, it smells nice and rich. Medium mouthfeel, velvety. Smooth sweet upfront with a nice roast coffee and dark chocolate back end. Lingering bitterness. The oak is there but to me is pretty subdued. A nicely balanced, solid beer. 565 characterskbutler1, Dec 09, 2011

A: Pours pitch black color. Half finger of tan head. Dies down a bit. Leaves some sticky lacing. This appears really well carbonated. On the swirl you can concur up a nice tight bubbled beautiful tan head.
S: Smells extremely deep and roasty. I do get some of the cherry along with the oak notes. Even with minimal bourbon aging I get it on the nose. Some nice vanilla and oak.
T: This is an intensely bitter brew, which I like. I get dark chocolate, molasses, black licorice notes as well. I get some of the oak for sure. The close has some vanilla. The alcohol is extremely will hidden. I could easily drink this all night. You get a little throat warming but that is it. it's actually pleasant. As the beer warms up, other flavors show up. Just delicious!
M: Full bodied beer, but it's not cloying by any means.
O: Solid A grade for this one. I've looked forward to it for a LONG time and it completely lived up to the hype train. Lots of deep flavors but none of them over power the beer at all. Flat our superb beer. 1,153 charactersinlimbo77, Dec 09, 2011

Pours a thick, rich, and black as all get out. Head is a buttery carmel.
Smell is burnt malt, sweet chocolate, with just a hint of hops. The hops are more up front than I remember. The molasses really stands out. Totally balanced in the best way. The alcohol is noticeable, but doesn't take away from any of the flavors. 
Tastes of butter, molasses, some piney hops. Mildly sweet. 
The mouthfeel is unbelievable. Thick, chewy, and coats the tongue entirely. 
Just an all around great beer! When its on nitro, its probably my favorite beer.

Poured into a Cigar City snifter. Pours jet black with a thin tan head that leaves good lacing.
Nose is bourbon, licorice, vanilla and molasses.
Taste follows the nose with some alcohol warming. Right out of the fridge, the taste is muted. Let this one sit a while to warm up and release the complex flavors.
Mouthfeel is thick and smooth with low carbonation.

A - modest carbonation with minimal head retention. Pitch black, with some alcohol legs...ominous signs...let's dig in 
S - possibly the most complex nose on a bottle this fresh. Aromas of milk chocolate, dark chocolate, espresso, vanilla, wood, bourbon, roasted malts, earthy hops, a slight astringent finish.
T - follows the nose, perfectly. Starts with mocha capuccino flavor cascading into espresso. In mid-palate, bourbon takes over, with vanilla, and charred wood. The sweetness is cut by wood, and earthy hops towards the back of the mouth. The bitterness lingers on a bit, and it then transitions into a tannic, slight astringent and vinuous finish reminiscent of a cabernet sauvignon. Incredibly complex, and I can only wonder what time will do to this beer. By far, this is the best tasting fresh bottle of RIS that I've ever had.
M - lush and full. The carbonation moves things along bringing out all the different notes.
D - amazingly drinkable for a beer this big.
Well worth the hype and justifies the premium cost. The best fresh RIS, and top 3 of all RISes I've ever had. 1,144 charactersgshak, Dec 08, 2011

A:Black through and through with a hint of chocolate drawn through when held up to the light. Pours a great threading 2 finger head with carmel-colored peaks.
S:Black strap licorice fills the nose followed by bourbon, vanilla, and molasses.
T:The front pallet is filled copious amount of licorice, vanilla, and slight hints of bourbon. Middle pallet continues with the bourbon with a follow through of slight bitterness.
M: Heavy but glorious. Very little carbonation and slightly syrupey, as with most high ABV Imperial Stouts.
O: I opened a bottle of 2009 4 months ago..so my perception is slighty skewed, that given, aging is of the essence, as with prior years. The fresh potential of the 2011 rivals that of the 2008 and 2010 vintages. 822 charactersAbrengle, Dec 06, 2011

All the other reviews say it all -- who am I to try to describe it better? OK, I have to get the 250 words -- Nice medium brown, lingering head; the aroma of malt and whisky hits you even before you quaff it. And it did not taste like river rocks. If you're only having one -- this is it, and at 11% in an Imperial Pint you better ride the Rhody Express home. 446 charactersmistaya, Dec 05, 2011

Very light carbonation -- almost no head on pouring, but the sparkle is there on sipping. I could go on and on about the wonderful aroma and big molasses and chocolate flavor, but I'll focus instead on that mouthfeel. For me, it doesn't get better than a big strong stout with serious body but a truly refreshing feel. "Thin" is usually a pejorative, but this had no hint of the stickiness found in a young version of the same or Stoic -- it just flows in a really magical way. Very impressed -- it's drinking fantastically right now and I truffle to imagine improvement with age. Open now! 632 charactersdrgarage, Dec 04, 2011
4.62/5  rDev +3.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5This is a review for the 2009.
Finally opened by last 2009 today, which I will be following up with one of my 2010s and a new 2011 (I'm splitting bottles - I can't imagine drinking that much on my own, ha).
A - Pretty carbonated still coming out of the bottle. Slightly paler head than the last newer vintage I had, but still looking like glorious used motor oil.
S - Smells like gingerbread drowned in molasses.
T - Blackstrap molasses, leather, and ginger. Lingering aftertaste. My last sip was 1 minute ago and I'm still tasting the ginger. Well-rounded, though, with an established mid-palate.
M - Heavy but smooth.
D - It's more mellow than the newer bottles, so it's pretty drinkable. Still a very, very strong stout, but not quite as sticky on the palate as the 2010 was earlier this year when I drank it.
Definitely worth waiting to open my last bottle. This beer has really evolved since its release. 916 charactersjekka, Dec 04, 2011

A - Served a dark chocolately brown with a nice dark tan head. The head never fades a bit and it leaves solid lacing down the entire glass.
S - The smell is strong chocolate, some slight coffee, nutty, with touches of vanilla and toffee.
T - The taste is very similar to the smell. The vanilla and toffee are a bit more pronounced here. Just an absolute delight to drink. 
D - Silky and smooth, nitro baby. A touch of bitterness in the finish, but again. World class.
O - I made a special trip tonight just to have this beer on nitro. I am so glad I got to have it again. If you can, hunt this one down. 779 charactersHuskyinPDX, Dec 02, 2011

I had this both on nitro and regular taps. Nitro definitely brought forward the chocolate and added a wonderful creamy nitro mouthfeel. However, the regular Abyss is still the favorite with all the complex layered flavors of chocolate, licorice, bourbon and oak that shine through more than on the nitro tap. 391 charactersrobsee, Nov 29, 2011

Pours a deep dark ruby black with a nice dark mocha colored head (with tight bubbles). The aroma has a nice smoky character, along with the sweetness of the molasses and some chocolate notes. The taste hits you with smokiness and wood along with some bitter chocolate, along with molasses and roasted malts to round it all out. The mouthfeel is medium-thick bodied with decent carbonation, smooth and creamy.
A well-balanced great brew from Deschutes, and the alcohol is well hidden. Definitely worth seeking out if you can find some. 587 charactersmkotsayfan, Nov 29, 2011

A: A thick jet black color that leaves no light through it. A small light brown head sits atop. Lacing is minimal.
S: Dark roasted smells with huge chocolate notes. Some espresso mixes in with a decent amount of woodiness. I get some sweet fruits with the sweet chocolate.
T: Massive dark chocolate flavors mix with some roasted malts and some espresso/coffee notes. The chocolate just keeps coming with some caramel sweetness that gets overtaken by the wood and smoke flavors. If I try, I gets some bourbon and vanilla from the barrels too. Just dark and dank, but oh so delicious. Alcohol creeps in on the finish but is totally welcomed. 
M: Full, coating, thick, some alcohol and nice carbonation for this thick of a stout. 
O: What else can I say. On tap this beer is just as great as in a bottle. This is a stellar barrel aged beer that does not punch you in the face with barrel aging. Great beer, award winning.
This was hear for Philly Beer Week and I wish we got it on a regular basis, hopefully soon. If I could get this and Black Butte, I would be totally happy. 1,286 charactersKadonny, Nov 28, 2011

A Pours a pitch black color that sucks in light like a black hole. It is topped off with a thick mocha head that dissipates quickly. 
S A smoky wood note that is reminiscent of Alaskan smoked porter out of all things. As it warms chocolate starts to appear along with a hint of vanilla. 
T A very distinct woody note which is interesting. Accompanied by bakers chocolate which adds a nice bit of bitterness. There is a faint hint of red wine, and a good bit of alcohol. You can really taste the barrel aging with this one.
M Thick and creamy with an alcoholic burn that makes you realize that this is an 11% beer. 
Overall this is a great vintage that will age well, It wasn't as good as the 08 I had that was 3 years old but I think that the 11 is off to a great start. 825 charactersbeerandcycling88, Nov 28, 2011

Poured like black oil..dark as night. A vigorous pour gave a modest one finger brown head that quickly receded and left a small light brown ring. Lovely.
 Dark chocolate, subtle licorice, vanilla/bourbon oakiness. Hints of dark fruit, dark malts, and a little booze kick. Man...it was nice.
The taste was bad-ass! Sweet, chocolate-forward initial taste complemented with a great vanilla-bourbon character. The blend was amazing and a delicious smokiness lingered as an aftertaste. Got better and better as ! let it warm. I can't believe I shared this! Oh well, it was Thanksgiving afterall.
Not as thick as I expected from the pour...still, ,very creamy and smooth. Coated my mouth leaving the smokey aftertaste. Some booziness but was not overpowering.
What can I say. A fantastic, top-tier imp stout. Next year I'll buy one to share, and one just for me. 1,013 charactersobrike, Nov 28, 2011

S: Vanilla first and foremost. Also wood, got a lot of dark burnt espresso, baking chocolate.
T: Exceptional. Got Coffee upfront at the beginning and that led into some vanilla with some black cherry. Kind of a driftwood like taste then just goes straight to chocolate. Very dark chocolate flavor that stays with you for a long long time
M: Nice and thick as I would expect a pure black stout brewed with molasses to be. Definitely feel the alcohol a bit on the tongue.
Overall this is one of the best beers I've ever had. Definitely a sipper as it has an extremely comlpex flavor and the longest aftertaste of all time. I can't wait to try it after the "best after" date. In the meantime I must obtain more bottles! 823 charactersBobheed, Nov 27, 2011

2011 22oz. poured in my Smuttynose tulip. 
A: opaque black with fine dark tan head. 
S: semi sweet chocolate, vanilla, bourbon, oak, and a hint of coffee.
T: very much like it smells (amazing), but with rich malty sweetness that I couldn't quite pinpoint on the aroma. I can definitely taste the molasses as the glass warms up. 
M: full bodied. strong alcohol warmth and oak/bourbon hits first followed by a complimenting chocolate and vanilla sweetness. the end swirls the mild coffee bitterness with vanilla.
O: This may be the finest beer I've ever had. The problem I have with most oak aged beers is that it tends to dominate the entire profile of the beer. According to the label this beer was blended from 4 batches! I would have loved to been there when they figured out the ratios, because they nailed it. No single flavor overpowers the next. Here is a perfect example of a truly complex beer where it is evident that everyone involved is passionate about what they do. I want more. Much, much more. 1,122 charactersBeforeNoon, Nov 27, 2011

2007 Vintage poured into a snifter. Reviewed from notes. 
A- Pours as black as a starless night with no light penetration. A half-finger mocha-colored head leaves a thick lacing with the first few sips, then fades to a thin ring. 
S- A bourbon aroma accompanies the dark chocolate and cherries that radiate from this perfect beer potpourri. There is a sweetness in the scent that is somewhat of a combination of molasses and milk chocolate.
T- An absolutely perfect taste transaction of the aroma. 
M- Not as thick as I thought it would be, but still on the thick side of medium or the medium side of heavy.
O- Unbelievable! The 2010 bottle I have left will definitely be remaining in my cellar for a few more years. I had this immediately after a pour of 2010 and this was leaps and bounds beyond the 2010 (and the 2010 was incredible). 862 charactersUngertaker, Nov 27, 2011

A- Pours a small mid-mocha head on a black beer. Great lacing with above average head retention.
S- Slightly bitter chocolate aroma, somewhat muted.
T- Big roasty chocolate notes. No way this is 11%abv, booze is ridiculously well hidden. Small tastes of oak and bourbon. Leaves an awesome taste in the back of the throat.
M- Medium to medium-thick mouthfeel. Medium carbonation.
D/O- Delicious chocolatey goodness shared with my girlfriend! Very smooth, a real treat. The Abyss deserves every accolade it receives. 532 charactersDuff27, Nov 26, 2011

The 2011 version seems to be built for the long haul, and is massively preportioned. The dark chocolate and molasses seemed to dominate the flavor profile, but with some noticeable licorice and bitterness in the finish. The intensity of flavor in the 2011 is impressive, and initially I found it difficult to drink/enjoy. However, the beer softened a bit as it warmed, and became increasingly enjoyable and drinkable. Regardless, this is an impressive effort, and is a beer that I suspect will only improve with age. I bought a bunch, so I guess I'll get to see. :-)
The 2012 version, sampled at the PDX brewpub in the pearl. Like the 2011, the 2012 is another RIS that seems to be built for the long haul. Massively built, there is plenty of coffee, dark chocolate and licorice in this beer, along with a considerable amount of roasty malt (mostly on the palate, but it comes across on the nose as well). The 2012 was a bit more approachable young than the 2011 (I had no problem drinking down my snifter), but still struck me as a beer that will likely improve with time. Unfortunately, the brewpub had already blown through their allocation (180 cases I was told), so will have to look around town to find some bottles to age.
2013 Abyss sampled at the brewpub in the PDX pearl. Really like the 2013 fresh, as it tastes like Deschutes has dialed back the hops a bit, with the beer showing a bit more richness and creaminess on the palate. This still comes across as a big beer, but there are some attrative nuances of wine and dark fruits (not sour) that seemed to mingle well with the considerable dark chocolate, vanilla and coffee. I also don't seem to be picking up quite as much licorice this year, though it's still there (just more in the background). While I'm sure this beer will age well as always, it's also very attractive and sexy in it's youth as well (something that is not always the case with young Abyss). 1,985 charactersJohn_M, Nov 26, 2011

2011 offering (so stoked to try the one I am cellering in a few years)
a - beautiful deep silky black/dark brown, very nice half finger stick around almost brown head and some sticky legs and lacing
s - OH MAN! Smells, like a beautiful fall/winter day, Best coffee smell I have smelled in a stout hands down, milk and dark chocolate, terrior, oak, vanilla, chocolate dipped cherries, smooth hand crafted bourbon but not boozey, slight dark berries from the wine barrels, tobacco, anise, molasses, candy sugar, toasted to perfection malts, a slight grassy almost hop like smell, some peat or maybe just Oregon soil and some slight toffee
t - bourbon, vanilla, chocolate, coffee, oak, cherries, toffee, soil, awesome bitter sweet, licorice, tobacco, tons of sweet and toasty malts, hop pop in the mouth, molasses, black berries, hints of a well done red blend and an almost fresh sod note
m - full bodied, well done complexity, well balanced, low acidity and huge long finish
d - if you don't like this beer, you may want to stop drinking or maybe even breathing all together. I am a fan of stouts, but people who hate stouts I think would enjoy this. The aroma, and taste make this beer one of the most enjoyable and very drinkable for any level beer fan
Final thought - if you don't have one get one. $12, 11% abv and everything you are looking for in a wonderful beer. Deschutes, you continue amaze! 1,413 characterswhatthehull, Nov 25, 2011

Splendid carbonation despite its age. The dark mocha head stands proud, but eventually yields, leaving a choppy ring of froth around the glass. Black through and through with no light penetration. 
Aromatically complex with profound sweet and dark chocolate notes that fuse with dark cherries, black licorice, peat, and a profound barrel-aged smokiness that has A+ stamped all over it.
Flavor is precise with more sweet chocolates, cocoa nibs, roasted coffee beans and a nice smack of smokiness. As it warms a few plum and raisin notes appear, as well as the molasses (as noted on the label), adding new and welcomed elements to the palate.
The Abyss is not as hefty as one might think; lying somewhere between medium and heavy. Smooth as silk with that smoky edge that keeps everything interesting, and a near total lack of alcohol heat that is astonishing because of the 11% of ABV hidden inside.
A stylistically perfect, flavorful, highly drinkable, and no worse for the wear beer for the ages. 1,108 charactersstephens101, Nov 23, 2011

M- Wonderfully thick, coats the mouth like silky hot chocolate. Perfect carbonation, not too much. Goes down very smooth with hardly any alcohol noticeable.

A: The Abyss pours a very dark black with a nice inch thick head, that quickly fades.
S: I am getting a good amount of roastedness and coffee. You can smell some bourbon and oak with a faint bit of toffee. 
T: Where to start. This is like Willy Wonka made this beer and there are a million different flavors popping up. I am getting a nice coffee flavor and some type of wine sweetness. It gives you a nice warm feeling and has a nice alcohol flavor. I am also getting some chocolate and some vanilla.
M: The Abyss is exceptionally smooth. It has a tiny bit of carbonation, but its absolutely perfect.
O: I hate to give a beer all 5's, but this is a beer that deserves it. I was so excited to get this and it didnt let me down. I have never had a beer so amazing in my life. The tastes are so complex and its just so much to wrap my head around. Just perfect. 877 charactersgtermi, Nov 23, 2011

4.77/5  rDev +6.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5My friend and I had two Deschutes beers. I had the Black Butte XXI, at the time we drank the beers it was one year and 364 days old, and my friend had the 2010 Abyss, it being 366 days old. We expected the drinking event would be superb. Little did we know it would blow our socks off.
This is a beautifully dark beer. What did Nietzsche say? "When you gaze long into an abyss the abyss also gazes into you." Well, with this beer, you just get sucked into it like a black hole. It's the blackest of black. When you hold it up to a light it is as if the light cannot compete. Ok, maybe I'm just saying BS here, but the point is this beer is midnight, charcoal black. The head forms relatively slowly and looks like a mocha foam, yet creamy.
If you spend half an hour just smelling this then I wouldn't blame you. Every inhalation of The Abyss is like you're inhaling for the first time, it is so complex. You literally cannot get enough. The smell has a warmth to it like smelling wine. It's definitely boozy but not overpowering at all, thanks to the rich chocolate and roasted coffee smells. The bottle says the beer is brewed with molasses and it definitely has a sort of burnt sugar aroma. Dark fruits are in there too with a distinct oakiness. Smell it, smell it again, and then keep on smelling. Every whiff will satisfy.
How does The Abyss taste? Oh my, I don't know if it could be properly put into words. Dark roasted coffee, delicious chocolate, satisfying sweetness, dark fruits like raisin and prunes, and some good, warming booziness. Every single flavor was exceptional. It was like a cascade of sweet, roasted awesomeness where the depth of flavor seemed to never end. There's some obvious booziness from the 11% ABV but even with it that high the amount of flavor keeps it completely satisfactory. Sometimes imperial stouts have so much flavor that you feel like you can't drink much of it. In the case of The Abyss such is not the case. With a beer as great as this the bombardment of rich flavor is too satisfying to stray from. There's also a bourbon-ish bite at the end that adds more complexity. I don't know if I've ever given a beer a 5 out of 5 on anything but I'm content with giving The Abyss a perfect score when it comes to taste.
Like I said when explaining the taste of The Abyss, many times I feel as I can't drink too much of an imperial stout, no matter how much I like the style, because they're so flavorful, so boozy, and so heavy. Well, The Abyss, while being a heavy beer, doesn't feel like it. It's not thin at all. It's just perfect. Creamy, smooth, a bit sticky from the sweetness, and insanely drinkable for how much flavor it has.
When I was drinking The Abyss I knew it was a great beer but it wasn't until after I drank it that I realized just how flippin' good it was. I actually got a bit...depressed because I knew I wouldn't drink another beer as good for a long time. The next time I see this on the shelf I'll definitely be purchasing it and aging it. I can only imagine how it tastes when aged longer. Great beer. 3,069 charactersBeardedRiker, Nov 23, 2011

 Earthy in the nose upfront with a touch of sweetness that reminds me of beet sugar and candied yams. The licorice and molasses seem melted together on the nose giving the beer a nice dark brown sugar, almost rich pancake syrup like smell, with a chocolate fudge quality. As the beer warms it begins to develop aromas of roasted malt, bourbon and vanilla, with a slight booziness.
 Low to almost no carbonation. Very soft and velvety on the the palate. Light to medium in body, almost to the point of being thin in the mouthfeel, making it dangerously easy to drink. Pretty amazing really. The 11% Abv is so well integrated it's undetectable. The barrel aging and addition of molasses, licorice are all perfectly in balance for me. Which is the standout of this beer, with all that's going on in Abyss it drinks so smoothly. 
 Has that earthy aspect in the taste, with the faint beet sugar and candied yams feel from the nose. Lots of fudge and milk chocolate flavors going on. Not too much licorice though. The molasses seems more evident with some good caramel notes mixed in. Bourbon and vanilla flavors appear more on the palate as the beer warms. It finishes with a roasted malt, somewhat bitter and dark fudge feel. 
 The mouthfeel on this beer was amazing for me almost to the point of being refreshing for a Double Imperial Stout. 1,423 charactersCashMoneyVagrant, Nov 22, 2011

A- Black as night - as true to form as it could be.
S- Smells of coffee, bourbon, chocolate - everything you would expect from the style.
I'm going to just stop this review. This brew is fantastic! I have had multiple vintages on tap...this is one of the most excessible. Very drinkable - just like the others...I'm sure it will age nicely. Seek out, rob and or pilage for a bottle. 420 charactersPlinythechugger, Nov 21, 2011

A- Inky black with a deep, thin brown head floating on top. Spotty lacing and moderate head retention. Dark and handsome, this beer looks ominous.
S- Bakers chocolate right outta the gate, followed by the same smell as the coffee aisle at the grocery store. A slight whiff of smoke.
T- Bitter chocolate and dark roasted coffee beans sweetened by a touch of molasses. Certainly doesn't drink its 11%. The chocolate in this is crazy. Some mild vanilla notes come through as well as a nutty earthiness.
MF- Creamy goodness. Slightly viscous with subtle carbonation. Really lingers in the mouth.
O/D- One of the best beers I've had, and certainly one of the best of the style that I've tasted. Can't stop sipping, and I don't wanna. Truly, truly enjoyed. Thanks duff27 for sharing! 795 charactersfdkayti, Nov 20, 2011

A- Totally opaque black pour, quite viscous. Finger width dark tan head that disappears quickly. Lacing is surprising for the age and bourbon aging.
S- Bourbon up front with coffee, molasses and dark chocolate. There is a slight smoke smell. The oak adds a slight vanilla and brown sugar. Alcohol is there but slight.
T- Right off the bat is huge coffee taste, followed by bakers chocolate. Molasses and licorice are much more subdued than the bourbon and vanilla from the oak barrels. Bitter aftertaste.
M- Full bodied, creamy and smooth. Slight alcohol warmth, quite chewy. 
O- Awesome stout, would be interested to try fresh. 729 characterskorguy123, Nov 20, 2011
4.7/5  rDev +4.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured into snifter from 22oz bottle. 2010 reserve. 
Appearance: Pitch black body with a thick tan head. Only a little bit of lacing on the sides of the glass, and head diminishes to a few broken up rings. 
Smell: Espresso, dark chocolate notes, and the slightest smell of bourbon. Little alcohol is recognized, which I like.
Taste: Coffee that was very lightly sweetened, but it is balanced out with some bitter dark chocolate. The bitterness isn't overwhelming and it is only present until you swallow the sip. No intense detection of alcohol. Sense hints of vanilla and a tiny bit of smokiness.
Mouthfeel: Thick but not too thick. Carbonated a good amount. Too smooth for my own good. I find myself wanting to drink more and more, but this is definitely one I have to savor. 
Overall: Spectacular beer. Ridiculous complexity in flavor. I love how smooth it is and how drinkable. It doesn't kick you in the face with the alcohol. It's a great beer. Hope I can get my hands on more. 988 charactersnmbr0ne, Nov 20, 2011

A - Pours pitch black, two thumbs of dark mocha head, solid retention and nice chunky lacing. Superb!
S - Nice dark cocoa notes, sweet milk chocolate, touch of ABV detectable on the nose. Candied cherries and hint of peat.
T - This is a rich brew, loads of flavour with the chocolate malts dominating. Touch of ABV sweetness, some leafy hop notes, a hint of licorice and molasses lingers on the palette. A bit of oak and peat are also coming through alongside some tobacco.
M - Comes across a tad thick, but the carbonation is fitting for the style, goes down smooth and finishes with a touch of dryness.
O - Perhaps the anticipation of this ale jacked up the ratings, but this is certainly a fantastic ale and made for a very memorable experience. Glad I could enjoy this alongside my BA bro and well worth the wait. 969 charactersandrenaline, Nov 19, 2011

A - straight blackness, thumb of deep brown head that was not going anywhere, globs of lacing
S - very rich malt, chocolate and licorice with compliments of vanilla, and subtle woody aromas
T - BIG beer, a bold mix of roasty and sweet malt, dark chocolate with some candied cherry sweetness, mild hints of vanilla and licorice, finishes with a charred woody flavour, and the high octane keeps you warm and sweet, way too good!
M - syrupy thick with a full sticky feel, just a little dry from the alcohol

4.05/5  rDev -9.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Well, I'm finally cracking an Abyss. I've been sitting on this one for a couple of years, and to top it off, it's an '09, so it could very well be an Abyss-ident, which I will actually be OK with as I really like tart beers anyway. I'm drinking this one to celebrate kicking off my next job search, hence, plunging into The Abyss. Here goes... Poured from the bottle into a snifter, review is from notes taken on 11/18/2011.
Appearance: Definitely looks like it should -- pour is a deep dark coffee brown/black and it starts with a pretty huge 2 and 1/2 finger head that looks like a milkshake sitting on top of the beer, and it has very good retention; beer is dark (duh) and entirely opaque; body looks moderately thick, and about where the American Double is at its best, but not as thick and chewy looking as a good RIS strikes me; thick, foamy sheets and rings of lacing are left behind on the sides of the glass.
Smell: Oh yes, it's infected. The second the cap is popped, it becomes more than evident. The most dominant smell is a funky, tart cherry ; a creamy and milky chocolate scent with some dark roasty/burnt coffee lies beneath.
Taste: It's actually really good, and I wouldn't mind if Deschutes wanted to bottle this beer including the infection on an annual basis; I thought that the tart/sour cherries would be the most dominant flavor, but actually, dark chocolate and strong roasty/burnt coffee (or even espresso?) is easily the most potent of the flavors, and the tart/sour cherries come in a strong second and compliment; bit of a lactic sour aftertaste lingers; alcohol isn't really present until I get some vapors in the back.
Mouthfeel: Body is a little thicker in the mouth than it appeared on the pour, and it's rather milky and creamy with a fair bit of grit sticking to the teeth; a thick and very sticky coating is left all over the roof of the mouth and it really feels like it's coating the whole way down my throat to my tummy, where there is a warming sensation from the sour/tartness, but also likely because of the higher ABV.
Overall: Definitely worth drinking. I've only had The Abyss one time prior to this (actually, it was a three year vertical tasting that I managed to get very small portions of), and I liked the uninfected version more, but this is definitely a drinkable bottle and I feel kind of fortunate that the infection didn't make it unbearable in any capacity. Deschutes is a solid brewery, and probably one of the most consistent in the nation, and I will continue to seek out their beers every chance I get, even when there are obvious mistakes in the process. 2,620 charactersbamadog, Nov 19, 2011

Awesome beer. Hop tarness at the back of the tongue followed by coffee flavors and a warming alcohol burn down the throat. Head retention is good, with the color similar, if not darker than the brown on the label on the bottle. Pours like cough syrup but drinks smooth. Only grip is gettin the wax capping off to open the bottle. Served in a pint glass at 45*.

Pours black of course, brown head with chunky lacing. Smells of bourbon, chocolate, coffee, char and roast, a bit of smoke as well. Taste is chocolate, coffee and soy, licorice has diminished. Mouthfeel has thinned a bit, but still quite nice. Real smooth, carbonation medium high, and faaar too drinkable.

Smells of bourbon, chocolate, vanilla, sour cherries. Pours pitch black (of course), tan head. Taste is complex; chocolate and coffee with a well balanced sweetness dominate, toffee, cherries, vanilla, caramel notes. Alcohol heat has died down considerably yet plays well with the bitter chocolate and residual malt sugar. Medium thick and creamy mouthfeel, very drinkable. I can see that my stock of this will not see too many more years...

Poured into a Stella tulip at 40*. Pours thick, with a billowing tan head that slowly falls to 1/4" after several minutes. Black of course, what else would you expect from greatness such as this? Aroma is sweet and sour, it makes me think of sour cherries, charred oak and bitter chocolate. Mouthfeel is thick without being cloying and syrupy. Taste is mellow chocolate up front with a sour bitterness, followed by smoke and what I can only describe as black patent malt. A little on the boozy side but still one of my favorites, this one will mellow nicely in my cellar.
Vintage 2010; reviewed 11 December 2010.
Pours black of course, slight amber edges, thick cocoa head tha falls to nice lacing. Smells of cocoa, malt, sweetness, licorice, anise, oak and vanilla. The oak is a lil heavy but will age nicely. Taste is chocolate covered raspberry, oak tannin, slight licorice; mouthfeel is very smooth and creamy, the fullest I can remember since the 06 vintage. Really heavy and coats the mouth, alcohol is subdued to the aftertaste, this will age beautifully. As it lingers on my palate I get more coffee and roast malt, burnt sugars, this is all 5s across the board!

Pours the obvious opaique black, ample tan head. Smell is just a hint on pine hoppiness, coffee, dark chocolate, and slight char. Taste is chocolate followed by muted coffee, vanilla, anise, and a cherry-like fruity tartness. Mouthfeel is thick and carbonation is medium. Hot damn, alcohol is well hidden but present, another win for Deschutes! 2,856 charactersyouradhere, Nov 19, 2011

Poured from 22oz bottle into Bordeaux glass.
Aroma: Nice--hot cocoa, blueberry, fudge brownie, vanilla, and smooth, light bourbon.
Appearance: 1/2 finger dark tan foamy head. Charcoal-black body. A fine sheet of foam remains as the legs of the brew drip down the inside of the glass.
Flavor: Hoowah! Dark chocolate, molasses, some smoke, and bourbon. Light vanilla, some butterscotch, and black licorice contribute to a very well-integrated sweetness. At the end is a light mineral quality, and a nice bitter finish that lingers.
Mouthfeel: Medium-low creamy carbonation, medium-full body, and some nice warmth from the alcohol.
Overall: An EXTREMELY well-balanced imperial stout. It measured up to all of the buzz I'd heard about it. I wish I had another 2010 to hold onto for a couple of years, and might try to get my hands on one. You should too! 943 charactersmdvatab, Nov 18, 2011

4.88/5  rDev +8.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 52011 Reserve. Poured into a Deschutes snifter at the release party at the Deschutes Brewpub in Portland. I was also able to enjoy one of the vertical flights afterwards.
A - This beer was black as night. No light was getting through here. The head was brown and thick. The 1/2 finger head was a bit surprising. I was expecting more of a finger to a finger and a half but by the time the server brought it to me, I'm sure the head dissipated some. It was super busy and crowded so who knows how long the beer was sitting at the bar. As the head continued to dissipate, it left a thick brown ring around the glass with some nice lacing. 
S - Dark chocolate is prominent here. But the vanilla, cherry and small coffee notes push their way through. The oak and bourbon notes really add to the overall complexity of the aroma. Some alcohol makes itself present as well. Such an amazing aroma. 
T - The molasses and vanilla hit up front followed by the oak, bourbon and roasted malts. The dark chocolate hits on the backside and seems to longer for a bit. I'm not really pulling any of the cherries or wine in the taste but it doesn't matter a whole lot to me. The taste is still so delicious. 
M - This is a full-bodied imperial stout. Little to no carbonation. It's creamy and leaves an oiliness that coats the back of the mouth. The warmth from the alcohol is nice. It reminds you that this is an 11% ABV beer without punching you in the face.
O - What a fantastic beer! Deschutes does it again. This beer is complex yet balanced. The aroma and taste are outstanding. I love the cherry and vanilla elements added to this year's release. This is everything a BA imperial stout should be. I was lucky enough to buy a few bottles at the brewpub. I plan on aging a couple of the bottles and seeing what happens. 1,809 charactersMahlik, Nov 18, 2011

Beer is from tap at brewpub on release party night
A: extremely dark with brown head and minimal lacing
R: hot, vanilla, chocolate, slightly fruity
M: big and thick, takes effort to swallow, modestly carbonated
T:dark fruit (prune, raisin), hops (indeterminate - back of tongue), somewhat (alcohol) warm
O: this is an outstanding beer, but sharp around the edges; given a few months or years it might mellow and round allowing the vanilla to manifest as flavor in addition/stead of scent, allowing the fruit flavors to develop and the hop sharpnesses to oxidize into a bit of butteriness. 
This is a beer well worth tasting and tastes well worth cellaring. 682 charactersrluser, Nov 16, 2011

Looking at this beer is exactly what I would think of when peering into an abyss....black...with a finger of dark bubbly brown head that leaves brown lacing all over the glass.
Lots of roasty coffee and chocolate here with some licorice and of course barrellzzz. Lots of vanilla and even the small amount of bourbon barrel makes an appearance. 
Drinking this thing was a treat. Very chocolatey on my first sip which was very exciting. A bitterness takes a hold all over the mouth before receding into lovely dark chocolate, espresso, and vanilla. There was not much carbonation which I wasn't expecting based on the bubbles that sprang up in the head. The Abyss has a full body and leaves you wanting more as you continue to sip it. 
Had a glass as part of Dallas Beer Week and now I want a bottle so bad. This is a great beer and a must try if you come across it. 902 charactersMattSweatshirt, Nov 16, 2011

A: Thick pour into a tulip yields a mocha head which recedes rather too fast. Color is true to the maw, but it's the legs which impress. They leave a brown stain on the glass.
N: Peppercorn, molasses, anise, chocolate, roasted malt, coffee. Laden with an earthy bitterness still. Fudge goes deep as does the licorice. Has a slight raspberry and cherry edge. 
T: Lots of blackstrap molasses and black licorice. Substantial earthy hoppiness. Roasted coffee and bittersweet chocolate. Lots of black peppercorns. Raisins and prunes compose the back of the flavors. Oaks, as always is quite strong, though bourbon is not. Every sip is a bitter, sweet, and spicy assault on the tongue, but it's never cloying or overpowering.
M: Heavy on the palate, but it does lack some of the heft of its competitors. Lots of alcohol still. This might have another couple of years until it peaks.
O: A fantastic RIS. Never goes too big in any one direction, which is a big positive in my book, because it's easier to find the spectrum of flavors. You'll enjoy it, it's a given. Pity this is the last year of the non-futzed version. 1,175 charactersSarlacc83, Nov 14, 2011

Beautiful rich and robust nose. Bursting notes of rich dark chocolate brownie, faint bourbony oak and faint leather. 
Flavor is amazing and bursting with flavor as well. Faint black licorice hidden nicely behind bold dark chocolate brownie and bourbon. Mild oakiness. Mild alcohol warmth. Faint back end cacao-like chalkiness. 
Mouth is rich and full bodied with a lovely velvety viscosity. Carbonation is low and creamy. 
Overall an amazing beer with Alot of complexity and a wide range of flavor and good balance. A must find/try. 617 charactersMrVonzipper, Nov 10, 2011

Man, this stout is dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, dark. It really did look very appetizing. 
The smell seems so strange. It doesn't appeal to my nose at all. 
The taste is not quite what I expected. It was very good, but it was heavy on the coffee flavor profile than I expected. I certainly can taste a hint of molasses coming though, the oak coming through slightly.
The mouthfeel is very, very dry. I felt like my mouth was shriveling up worse than a prune. This is after letting the beer breathe for a long while, and I feel like something's wrong. It's not normal. 
Overall, I don't see the hype. I am starting to think that I may had gotten a bad bottle that is skunked or something. I imagine I will need to try another bottle to truly see if the consistency is there. I prefer Goose Island's Bourbon Rare Stout far more to this one. It's incomparable, so I only consider this to be a decent beer, but not world class at all. 
So far, so what.... I'll have to revisit this review when I somehow get another 2010 bottle, or at least try the 2011 vintage somehow. 1,140 characters2xHops, Nov 08, 2011

T: Wow there is a lot going on here. I can definitely taste the licorice and chocolate. Coffee comes next just like the smell would say, roastiness and molasses comes up on the finish
M: Smooth and clean. Really nice body and feel on this one, the barrel aging is evident here in the smooth feel.

4.77/5  rDev +6.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured from bottle into a Founders tulip.
Appearance: The body is quite dark brown to black. Head is a medium brown that grows to 8 cm or so and then slowly subsides. Light brown lacing is left.
Smell: Dark malt and light wood blend with the faintest hint of licorice. This smells beautiful. A touch of vanilla sugar comes in and out of the aforementioned notes.
Taste: Well, it's delicious. The choco-malt starts and quickly turns into a deep but not burnt roastiness. This is balanced by the sweetness of the molasses and moves into a slight oakiness with a vanilla ghost. The last, long and slow-fading notes are the molasses. I am left with the most pleasant char. Damn, this is good.
Mouthfeel: Velvety as hell. It coats, lingers, and leaves just before it might be too much. The other beer this reminds me of in mouthfeel is Black Note - another knockout.
Overall, I think this beer deserves all the praise that it has been shown before this review. I love it. Truly a masterpiece. 992 characterseyeenjoybeer, Nov 02, 2011
4.64/5  rDev +3.6%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5From a trade with pintplease, thanks a ton! This is one of the rarest beers I've managed to acquire (living in Canada...) and it makes a great choice for my 400th review. Aged three years, no less (2008 vintage). Looking good as soon is it hits my glass with a super thick and oily viscosity. Pitch black body. A thin-but-dense cover of mocha head forms, leaving a little lacing. 
The nose is soft and smoothed-out; all kinds of stout complexity but very integrated: oak and bourbon, black olives, salty Scandanavian black licorice, subtle lactose, lightly-smoky roast, good earthy hops. Zero alcohol. Huge, dark and earthy nose. 
The Abyss is quite a fitting name here as this beer displays some of the deepest malt I've experienced, just completely saturated with huge amounts of roast malt. Light coffee and 99% dark chocolate, a perfect blending of bourbon, dry oakiness, minerals and the right hint of alcohol (insanely smooth for 11% ABV). I'm not picking up on any licorice, not even the salty variety I found with the nose. I'm not sure how this one tastes fresh but I suspect three-years' time has really smoothed-out and tied it together. 
Creamy, oily, viscous body. Just the right touch of carbonation. Perfect feel for a big stout like this one. 
While this beer is certainly amazing, the complexity I was hoping for somehow isn't quite there. Maybe the aging has smoothed out all the edges, I'm not sure. Sitting at #15 on BA's top 100 beers creates certain expectations and I'm not sure they were completely met. Still, this is easily one of the best beers I've tried and I would definitely seek it out again. 1,628 characterseat, Oct 31, 2011

Did I mention alcohol? The Abyss doesn't do much to mask the alcohol; like the Honey Badger, it don't give a shit. No matter. Thick dense flavor waves of all of the above, with fruit coming in now and then. Thick and syrupy without being cloying. 
Great drinking experience, one of the best stouts I've had. 412 characterslurpy1, Oct 30, 2011
4.87/5  rDev +8.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Split a bomber with my girlfriend on the first "cold" night this year.
Pours an absolute pitch black (much like I would imagine the actual Abyss to look like...) with 2 fingers of creamy dark tan head. Pretty good retention with thick, thick legs and some pretty lacing for sure.
The aroma is absolutely amazing! Dark chocolate, dark roasted malts, licorice, rich bourbon, molasses, a touch of vanilla and some great oaky notes.
The taste follows the nose but blends all of the flavors together extremely well! Rich dark chocolate and roasted malts, sweet and thick molasses, licorice, some vanilla, oak and delicious bourbon.
The mouthfeel is incredibly silky, full bodied, low to medium carbonation and chewy. Absolute bliss as it coats my tongue with each sip. Great heat from the booze with each sip. Wouldn't mind it being just a tad bit thicker... but still, this is like sex in my mouth every time I take a sip.
Overall, this is one of the best beers I have ever had. This is the first one that I have opened since I bought and had my first one back in January. Absolutely amazing. Can't wait to get some 2011's to add to my collection. Will definitely be opening a few more of these throughout the holiday season/winter. 1,233 charactersdcloeren, Oct 29, 2011

It's dark. It's thick. It's rich. It's complex. It's woody. And now it's gone.

Reviewed from notes
2009 infected batch
Pours a very thick black with a dark tan head. The smell is richly caramel and deeply toasty with a tartness I am assuming is coming from the infection. The taste is more of the same. It is sticky thick and coats my glass like robitussin but manages to not be cloying. Really deep and complex brew that is accented by a touch of infection but it doesn't take over. I really want to try it fresh now.
edit 1/3/2011
Had a fresh 2011 bottle and loved it even more than the aged version. The smell was much more complex so I bumped that up from a 4 to a 5. Really complex nose with licorice, caramel, toast and some dark fruits. This also bumped the overall score up to a 5 in my opinion. Just an overall great brew, glad I picked up a couple to enjoy. 840 charactersquirkzoo, Oct 13, 2011
4.36/5  rDev -2.7%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Drank over the weekend, review from notes. Pours like motor oil...no exaggeration. Very very viscous and black as night. A vigorous pour yields a modest 1 finger brown head that quickly recedes leaving a small mocha ring. 
The nose is a little less intense than I had expected. Rich dark chocolate, subtle licorice, vanilla oakiness. Some moderate bourbon notes (not as upfront as I like). Hints of cherries, dark malts, and a little booze kick.
The taste is wonderful...slightly sweeter than my favorite, Parabola...but it was a welcome sweetness. Very chocolate-forward complemented with a great vanilla/oak/bourbon character...blends amazingly and a delicious smokiness lingers as an aftertaste. Really enjoyed sipping this.
Not as thick and chewy as expected from the pour. Very creamy and velvety. Coated my mouth leaving the smokey aftertaste. Some booziness but not overpowering.
AWESOME BEER...I am obsessed with barrel-aged stouts! thanks to GregSVT for hooking me up! 981 charactersiflah45, Oct 10, 2011
4.6/5  rDev +2.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4A: Pours quite viscous (almost glugs) and completely black.  No highlights, no edges, no hues.  A small brown head sits atop the ... well ... the black abyss.  Thins out to leave a thin film and moderate lacing. 
S: Aroma is comprised of dark chocolate, toffee, dark fruit (raisin, plum, fig, cherry), and a bit of vanilla.  Surprisingly sweet up front.  The sweetness competes with roasted barley, dark malts, coffee, anise, and bourbon.  A touch of hops and booze as well.  Really and damn complex beer that smells fantastic. 
T: More roastiness than even the smell would lead you to believe.  Roasted barley, char, burnt malts, anise, espresso, spent coffee grounds.  Oddly, the taste and the aroma are opposite one another in their dominant qualities.  Roasty and slightly bitter up front.  Transitions to a sweeter finish with toffee, vanilla, molasses, and semisweet chocolate, along with subtle dark fruit that match the smell well.  Bourbon and booze are subdued, but the sweeter barrel characteristics are evident. 
M: It's thick, what can I say.  The pour prepared me for the coating qualities of this beer.  It's heavy and sits well on the tongue.  Swallows are almost forced a bit to get it down, but not due to harshness or unpleasantness.  It's just pretty darn viscous.  Carbonation was a little higher than I expected, but combated the thickness a little to make it nice and creamy.  Really feels fantastic as I rolled it around in my mouth. 
D: Ideally, I could sip on this forever.  Realistically, it's not that easy to put down.  It's a big beer and it carries a punch.  Super complex, heavy, viscous, but absolutely delicious.  It's a sipper for sure, and takes some time to put it away, even when split among friends.  I really, really enjoyed this one and look forward to the next bottle I can get.  1,853 charactersMississipping, Oct 08, 2011

Smells of chocolate and roasted malts. My cold is preventing me from picking up more subtle smells, but from what I can tell it's great.
Some great roasted tones hit the palate immediately and I can tell the journey to the bottom of this glass is going to be sublime. Just a touch of booze near the end along with a very smooth incredible chocolate flavor. Finishes with a little roasted bitterness. This may be one of the best stouts I've ever had.
Viscous without approaching cloying at all. Low carbonation levels, but enough not to be flat. Like drinking chocolate milk.
Amazing beer. I've been waiting a while to open it and I'm glad I still have several more left. 775 charactersjmarsh123, Oct 02, 2011
4.55/5  rDev +1.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Essentially black in color with a dark tan head that dissipated slowly. Amazing aroma full of coffee, molasses, vanilla, and bourbon. The flavor has many layers and I noticed different things as it warmed up. I tasted molasses, roasted malts, coffee, and dark chocolate. It’s heavy in body and lightly carbonated. It has a very creamy mouth feel and is incredibly smooth! It finishes with roasted malts and some alcohol that provides a nice warming touch. For an 11% ABV beer, the alcohol is very well hidden. It's incredibly drinkable now and I can only imagine how great it will taste in a year! 599 charactersnotsoprobeer, Sep 22, 2011

Appearance: Abyss pours a black color with about an inch of light brown head and a small amount of lacing down the pint.
Smell: It smells of roasted and chocolate malts no hint of it being sour. 
Taste: This is just how I remember having it in May of 2008 when my son was born. It has a delicious malt backbone that smack you in the mouth like a stout should. Roasted and chocolate malts with some dark fruits like figs and raisins. I can still taste some alcohol which I love even though it is 2 years old.
Mouthfeel: Abyss coats the tongue like you would expect a great stout too, it lets the flavor linger well into the next sip. 645 charactersraznug, Sep 17, 2011
4.43/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.52010 reserve opens with a hiss and poured into a snifter.
Pours absolutely pitch black and leaves a one finger mocha head which settles to a bubbly film.  Only a little lacing.
Right up front I get milk chocolate, light coffee, vanilla, prunes and other dark fruits, roasted malt, toffee, and a nice warming touch of bourbon oak barrel.
Initially I taste dark roasted malt and bitter dark chocolate.  The middle is espresso beans, cocoa, caramel/toffee and the licorice begins to come thru.  Finishes with a bitterness from licorice and pure dark chocolate.  More lingering bourbon as it warms. Complex and very rich, so well balanced.
Mouthfeel is full bodied with incredibly fine, effervescent carbonation.  Incredibly smooth and creamy.
Overall, although I'm not crazy for bitter licorice stouts, this was extremely tasty and very much worth the hype. 864 charactersAdrianized, Sep 13, 2011

S: rich malty aroma punctuated with chocolate and roasted notes 
T: rich and complex blend of sweet malt and plenty of chocolate as you'd expect. The label mentions licorice, molasses and aged in bourbon barrels but all of these flavors are balanced so as not to dominate. In particular I don't get a pronounced bourbon character, possibly it is coming through more as a vanilla note. But, the flavor is fabulously rich and complex.
M: full bodied, creamy and warm, but not at all hot despite the high ABV
O: it is amazing to me that so many strong flavor components are melded in a rich and complex beer without letting anything dominate - this beer takes on a bit of a chameleon -like character as a result as a different nuance peeks out with each sip. Rich, dark, sweet, complex and very easy to drink. The richness hides the 11% ABV very well. 895 charactersBobCS, Sep 13, 2011
4.97/5  rDev +10.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured from 22 oz bottle into a snifter
Pours black with a thin layer of sandy brown head. Many medium sized bubbles clustered in the center of the glass. Good head retention for a barrel aged beer.
Smells of oak soaked roasted malt. Dark chocolate and toffee notes. Heavy bourbon and dark fruit followed by vanilla. Bold, dark and complex while maintaining a great barrel aged balance.
Silky bourbon, roasted malt, chocolate and vanilla unpeel layer by layer on the tongue. Sweet in the middle with a bitter bourbon oak finish. This is the perfect desert/special occasion beer.
Creamy smooth mouthfeel. Great viscosity and overall bold presence. Leaves you quenching for more after each sip. Alcohol is well hidden which makes for easy drinking for such a big beer.
Incredible barrel aged stout. It was everything I was expecting and more. Bold, rich and textural. Surprisingly easy to drink with a near perfect balance. Every aroma and flavor is flawlessly layered. This is a must try for barrel aged stout lovers. I know I will seek it out again and again. 1,064 charactersdgugliuzza, Sep 12, 2011

2010 Vintage
Served at room temperature in a tulip wine glass. 
Appearance: **** me... This is like motor oil in a bottle. Pitch black, even during the pour. Absolutely no light gets through this, not even my extra strong LED torch yields penetration on the edges! 
A rough pour yields a large, creamy coffee brown head that lasts pretty well and leaves great lace for the Abv. 
This is honestly the most perfect looking beer I can imagine!
Smell: Massive nose. Sweet melted dark chocolate, chocolate fudge, heavily roasted coffee, molasses, roasted malt, bourbon, vanilla, hints of toasted coconut, charred wood and dark fruit combine perfectly. As the beer warms a hint of cola and some hops are noted. 
Taste: From the first sip there is no question in my mind that The Abyss is going to earn full marks in the taste department. Absolutely huge flavour, perfect mixture of sweet, roasted and bitter. Dark chocolate, chocolate fudge, tons of coffee and molasses, roasted malt, some dark fruit (dates and burned raisins), a touch of liquorice, bourbon, vanilla and oak. The Abv. is not totally covered, but is very well integrated into the flavour profile. 
Initially the beer is sweet, but moderate bitterness and dry roasted character keep it balanced. 
Mouthfeel: Heavy body, pretty thick and oily with perfect smooth creamy carbonation. 
Overall: I ended up paying about 70US$ for this bottle, but boy was it worth it! The Abyss certainly lives up to the hype and I will make every effort to get another (500) bottle(s)! 1,556 charactersThehuntmaster, Sep 11, 2011

A- Pours black as night and has a 1 and a half finger mocha chocolate brown head. retention is fantastic and the body completely opaque. The head is not very thick and frothy leaving very heavy lacing. Stouts do not look any better than this.
S- very big malt notes followed by chocolate and piney hops. Roasty notes are there as well as a small black licorice, but very small. Very nice scent.
T- Nice complex dark flavors in this one. Big sweet malt, chocolate and medium darker roast coffee are prominent upfront. Fig Newton like dark fruit comes out toward the middle which takes you to a medium bitter and semi sweet finish. Tiny hint of alcohol on the finish as well. Lots going on in this one.
M- Definately heavy with a smaller amount of carbo. Thick and creamy at every sip. And thats exactly how to drink this one, slowly
O- Fantastic beer to end my "summer" with. I have tried and tried for a while for this beer and it lived up to my expectations. Cant wait to get my hands on more and older vintages. 1,101 charactersGushue3, Sep 06, 2011

nice cherry and sherry aromas with molasses there. Very little coffee and licorice, but the bourbon is still around. Tastes okay still, but has a really rough finish. Lots of acrid roastiness along with some definite cardboard oxidation.
This beer is definitely oxidized which makes the nose great, but the finish is tough to bear. Still great but I'm glad I didn't wait any longer on this bottle. I have had it fresh to 6 months numerous times and think that that's the way to go with this beer. 532 charactersChrisPro, Sep 03, 2011

poured into tulip glass.
Appearance: Great looking stout! Pitch black dark motor oil colored body of this beer. 1 finger of dark mocha brown head. Not really expecting any head on this beer as thick as it looks while it was poured. 
Smell: Roasty expresso, smokey like acampfire and charred oak. 
Taste: Big roasty expresso and rich dark chocolate notes. It tastes just like it looks intensely dark. Smokey and roasty for sure, i think some leathery and earthy notes are tasted also. It got a mild hint of booze that starts midtaste and goes thru to the finish. As this ber warms the black licorice and molasses seem to immerge from the deep roasty malts and give a sweeter taste to the beer. Might be some raisins in there also. 
Mouthfeel: This beer is full bodied with a carbonation thats stands on the high end of low carbonation; almost moderately carbonated. This beer is so thick that it is almost syrup. Almost perfectly carbonated.
Overall: Really awesome beer. This beer shows that Deschutes puts alot of "TLC" into the reserve series beers. The beer is well made and well named! I can see why it so high up on the lists on BA. 1,235 characters4DAloveofSTOUT, Aug 29, 2011
4.23/5  rDev -5.6%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4This will be my first Abyss (2010). What a better way to pass the time while I sit in the garage and brew some cream ale. This puppy pours black as night into my New Belgium snifter with a 2 finger dark mocha head that looks like it might stick around for a while. It smells of chocolate and coffee.
The first sip is solid but a bit bolder than I was expecting. The initial taste is of dark chocolate and coffee, licorice and possibly wood with some alcohol presence. As I continue to drink and things warm up, the coffee, licorice and oak are really coming out. Things are starting to sweeten up but not overly so. I'm not tasting any bourbon.
In the home stretch as the beer really warms, the licorice, oak and alcohol are dominating and some hop bitterness is coming through. 
This is a very solid RIS that reminds me quite a bit of Stone's IRS. Very good overall but I'd like to store one of these guys away in the cellar for 2 to 3 years and see what some age does to mellow 
things out a tad. 1,001 characterssmchenry75, Aug 26, 2011

Pours a beautiful viscous black with a mocha colored head that very fluffy and dissipates moderate lacing on the glass.
Smell is a thick hit of roasted malt and chocolate then some toffee and raison/dark fruit at the end. Very nice.
Taste is tons of roasted malt, chocolate, and coffee. Very nice!! Fruit and tobacco as well. This is one of the best tasting stout I have ever had.
Mouthfeel is medium in weight. Carbonation is very well done with the weight. Nice tingle with it.
Overall this is one of my favorite stouts and in my top 5 beers. I would like a stronger head but awesome no less. 689 charactersUMNbeerhunter, Aug 25, 2011

A: It pours a dark black opaque with no real head expect for a small tan film that disappears quickly. There's not really a foam lacing, but the beers is thick and hangs to the sides of the glass.
S: There's quite a bit going on in this one. Molasses, brown sugar, dark roasted malts, bitter chocolate, pure vanilla extract, candied figs and prunes. There's also a savory touch in there. It's very mouthwatering. Balanced and tantalizing. 
T: What a big complex beer! Roasted coffee, with some bitter hops running down the middle, bitter dark chocolate, vanilla, oak with some notes of bourbon in there; rich molasses with a savory, almost salty quality to it. The boozy notes open up more in there as it warms.
M: It has a full creamy milky body, that leaves a nice juicy, yet slightly chalky feel in my mouth. Low carbonation. 
O: Oh my gosh! I can drink this one forever! It's such a great one to sip and savor. I feel like I'm spoiling myself drinking this one; it's so rich and decadent. What a treat! I can't wait for the 2011! 1,053 charactersmarikoangel, Aug 21, 2011

Note: 2009 vintage
Review adapted from notes taken 11/5/10
Appearance: Blacker than black, pours like oil but manages to form a remarkable brown head - the brown fluff sticks around, and it leaves behind a beautiful lace
Smell: Nearly as epic as they come - super burnt, charcoal... charred charcoal, if that even makes sense - leather, coffee beans, some sweetness, some hops
Taste: Harsh but delicious, deliciously complex - as the smell would suggest, tastes extremely burnt - burnt malts, roasted malts, char, chocolate, espresso, molasses, caramel - some spiciness beneath an extreme amount of bitterness - some wood and some bourbon, but they are insanely well-balanced with the rest of the flavors - very malty yet somehow not too sweet, which, in my opinion, should be the goal of every imperial stout
Mouthfeel: Very thick but not sludgy - extremely smooth, but comes off as slightly harsh because of all the burnt flavors - amazing nonetheless
Overall: Simply amazing fresh, and so much potential...
It's scary how good this beer is. If all of the harsh characteristics drop out after a year or two of aging, this will probably earn a permanent spot in my top 10 favorite beers of all time. It's so ridiculously good. 1,281 charactersangrybabboon, Aug 17, 2011
4.53/5  rDev +1.1%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5An excellent beer, no doubt. I don't know if I agree with its place on the top beers list, but just due to personal preference. I prefer a bit more bourbon barrel in my barreled stouts, but this is solid in all respects.
Pours jet black, living up to its name. 
The barrel aging doesn't come through strongly for me, probably because only a portion is barreled, in either aroma or taste. Licorice, roast, molasses, a wonderful melding of imperial stout flavor. While I haven't had one in a few months, I don't recall it having much booze/alcohol in the nose or flavor.
Mouthfeel is solid, not quite syrupy, but thick and rich like it should be.
Overall, yes, one of the top imperial stouts, but perhaps not quite one of the top beers on planet earth. Close though... 770 charactersmarct, Aug 16, 2011

A: Darkest I have ever seen, absolutely no light can penetrate this beer. A hard pour into a snifter produced a beautiful two finger smoky brown and ashy head. Great lacing surrounded my glass and remained until I was finished drinking.
S: The initial smell has a coffee like aroma, but upon further examination this beers complex nature becomes more apparent. I could detect earthy tones followed by nuts molasses and hints of licorice. 
T: If you are looking for the most robust, well-balanced and least forgettable Stout, than this is your beer.

T - multi-faceted; it took me a while to make the connection with my taste buds, but it is like Jamaican Blue Mountain Coffee and Kahlua with milk chocolate essence, licorice added. Alcohol very smooth and creeps up on you. Very rich; something holiday-like about it.
M - it's like the feeling you get when you rest a chunk of good dark chocolate on your tongue and let it melt. Very velvety and good.

4.92/5  rDev +9.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Intro: Split a 22oz. 2010 vintage with a friend in snifter glasses.
Appearance: Deep dark rich virtual black with a thin (maybe ½ inch) chocolate brown head that dissipates rather quickly.
Smell: A great, rich, complex aroma that entices you to taste. Initially, I got the rich coffee, subdued molasses and licorice. Followed by a roasted coffee or nutty fragrance. The alcohol is hidden nicely behind the many layers of fragrances. Your mouth starts to water in anticipation of the first taste. 
Taste: Not to be disappointed, this is one great tasting beer from first sip to last drop. In the foreground is coffee, followed by a whole host of flavors more subdued. Vanilla, toffee, licorice, molasses, and several underlying components that leave you guessing. One of the more complex tasting beers that I’ve had. One impression that I got from the initial sip was that of the dessert tiramisu.
Mouthfeel: Extremely well balanced. Slight warming from the alcohol but not off-putting in the least. Not a noticeable aftertaste or oiliness. Very pleasant.
Overall: One of the most enjoyable beers I’ve had. A great dessert beverage. I’m not a coffee lover but I loved this beer. Not a chugger but a sipper. Possibly in my top 15-20 beers to date. Will definitely have again and try to keep a little around for that special occasion. If you can find it, you should definitely try it. 1,393 charactersheysuz, Aug 09, 2011

A: From the bottle comes a dark brown, but appears black in the glass. A 1/2 inch of dark tan head tops things off before dissipating.
S: Roasted malt with hints of vanilla, oak, and a touch of smoke. Licorice comes out strong as the beer warms.
T: Roasted malt again, but this time the licorice comes through a touch more. The vanilla and oak make an appearance 2/3 of the way through. The smoke isn't as present, but if I look for it I can find it. The big additions are a heaping helping of chocolate and a bit of coffee to round out the flavor.
M: A smooth texture to complement the thickness of the beer. A bit of heat creeps in at the end. 
O: A pleasure to drink. I couldn't take the suspense any longer and had to see if it was infected or not. So glad it wasn't. Looking forward to my non-2009's that much more. 980 characterscptnspeed1, Aug 06, 2011

2009 bottle poured in to my Portsmouth snifter
Best after 11.1.10
A: This beer pours a deep, dark, opaque black with a two finger of thick, rich creamy brown head. Head recedes at a moderate pace and leaves sheets of lacing on the glass.
S: Nose is deep oak notes, vanilla, bitter dark chocolate, and a touch sour. Infection worried me for a bit which delayed the opening, but after enjoying Cisco's Dark Woods this year, I figured even if infected, I would still enjoy this.
T: Taste starts with tons of oak notes, with some vanilla seeping through. Bitter chocolate, perhaps a hint of soured cherries, licorice and more vanilla are present - all the while, the undercurrent of oak notes still come through. Finish is a big citrus hop bite, charred malts, charred molasses and an alcohol warming. As the beer warms, the soured cherry notes become less pronounced and the coffee flavoring begins to border on espresso. 
M: Fuller bodied, moderate carbonation, thick and slightly creamy, with a chewy finish.
O: Goes down easily, very tasty, filling, big kick, nice representation of style. I think there may have been a touch of infection in this bottle...but I have to say that I enjoy what I've dubbed the wild stout. It's two of my favorite styles lopped in to one. 1,414 charactersJayli, Aug 04, 2011

The mere sight of the pitch black pour with a fingers worth of tan head set my heart racing. Little did I know I was about to try one of the most sought after brews in the craft beer community.
Smells of chocolate, liquorice, molasses and a hint of coffee that became more pronounced as the beer warmed up.
I find it hard to put this beer down once I start drinking it as the taste and mouthfeel simply blow me away. Viscous but not difficult swallow, simply stellar. 537 characterspdeepak, Aug 02, 2011
4.42/5  rDev -1.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5I have had multiple vintages, this beer never disappoints, I would really like to try some of the 100% barrel aged version. 
Pours black as night with a billowing mocha colored head, develops a decent rim and hangs out for a little while before dissipating to a light ring. 
Smells like dark fruit, dark chocolate, and subtle notes of vanilla from the oak. Some great complexity but not quite enough barrel for my tastes.
Tastes much like it smells, greaty oily mouthfeel, coats every part of the tongue and has a wonderful finish. Lots of dark fruit and chocolate, little bit of caramel, little bit of coffee. A nice treat, and one that everyone should try at some point. 675 characterspkeigs, Aug 02, 2011

A- Pours a midnight black with a 1 finger mocha colored head that sticks around. Leaves excellent lacing. Alcohol legs present.
S- I get bourbon and barrel notes first off. Chocolate, coffee, and roasted malts follow suit with woody and vanilla notes persistent throughout. Smells a lot like KBS to me.
T- Sweet and dark chocolate malts initiate the taste immediately followed up with waves of barrel notes that are helped along by soft bourbon pushes. A giant coffee note makes itself known towards the finish and lingers pleasantly through the ending. Some huge flavors that are nicely balanced and differentiated.
M- Definitely thick and viscous, but not as much as a Plead the 5th or Dark Lord. I expected a bit more for the name Abyss. The carbonation is a bit more than I'm used to in a stout.
O- The Abyss definitely lives up to its' reputation as a world-class stout. I have this in the same league as KBS in my book. 1,019 charactersstxSS07, Jul 31, 2011

2010 vintage.
A- Two finger frothy brown head, dissipates to a nice bubbly ring around the glass, dark pitch black color, nice lacing and retention.
S- The aroma is pretty boozy but not off putting, coffee aromas come out up front followed but roasted notes, the aroma is fairly bitter with some hints of chocolate/cocoa.
T- The taste is similar to the nose, nice coffee flavors, roasted malt, slight vanilla taste, definitely taste the oak from the barrels, bitter aftertaste, molasses comes out as well. 
M- Big mouth feel, thick and chewy, well carbonated, smooth in the finish, sticky on the palate.
O- This is definitely a solid quality RIS, it deserves the praise it gets on a consistent basis, would I say it’s one of the best in the World….No but I would drink this on more than one occasion. Looking forward to ageing a couple bottles and trying them in the future. 956 charactersChriscrundwell12, Jul 30, 2011
4.3/5  rDev -4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.5This bottle looks pretty formidable, and there's no easy way to get the black wax seal off the cap, so i've spent a few minutes chipping away with a steak knife. 
The beer is thick and black with a nice finger and a half of creamy tan head that settles slowly. Lacing is predictably syrupy and copious. 
Aroma is a welcome roasted coffee, cocoa, a definite molasses-sweetness, and a faint booziness in back. 
Strong, burnt-toast flavors alongside dark-roasted coffee, dark fruit (blackberry?), molasses, vanilla, and some bourbon. Very tasty. No real sign of that licorice.
Mouthfeel is that nice viscous syrup-like texture I've come to expect from a well-crafted imperial stout.
An excellent offering- though this should definitely be shared (the bottle). 761 charactersendincolorado, Jul 28, 2011

3.35/5  rDev -25.2%look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 2 |  overall: 3.5It’s amazing how certain beers gain legendary status. Often times that beer is a Russian Imperial Stout. In this case, we have a great brewery brewing a legendary style. So, of course, if you are a fan of the brewery (and I am a fan of this brewery), you will be prone to give high marks. But, when compared to other RIS’s, the Abyss just doesn’t stand up. Certainly, it stands apart. It is unique for embracing the smoky side of dark malts and for giving us the ever-enduring anise licorice flavor, but the beer itself is just too thin. Where it gives smoke and licorice, it takes away fullness and chocolate richness. The Abyss is certainly a contender in the imperial stout throne room, but it is a minor god, if you are considering the great Olympians. 762 charactersdnrobert24, Jul 25, 2011
4.11/5  rDev -8.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4A bottle of the 2010 reserve pours dark and rich into my glass. This beer is the absence of light with not even a highlight making it through the motor oil appearance. The head is gigantic for an 11% brew, cappuccino brown, thick and fluffy. It sticks to everything it touches. This beer looks exactly how an imperial stout should.
The nose is a mix of roasted grains, molasses and coffee with a slight hint of oak and licorice. It comes across slightly boozy which is a shame. I bet some longer aging would have mellowed it out nicely but who has that kind of paticence. 
Love the flavors going on here. It starts with big grains and never looks back. Meaty malts that taste like everything from sweet caramelized breads to rich roasted coffee and chocolate. The finish is the slightest hint of that licorice with a firm vanilla oak flavor that rounds out the brew nicely. Wow.
The mouthfeel is equally as appealing with a lovely licorice bite and a mild carbonation. Smooth and chewy with a great boozy warmth in the finish. This is a solid beverage that was worth the several month wait since I bought it. I just wish I had another bottle stashed away to come back to in a few years because time can only make this one even better. Great brew Deschutes. 1,259 charactersjbphoto88, Jul 24, 2011

In an attempt to muster a head, I poured this one right down the center of my glass. Smooth move Ferguson - I was rewarded with a billowing, 2.5 finger coffee-colored head that just wouldn't go away. The beer itself was impossibly black, with a consistency that approached crude oil. Stunning.
Serious blackstrap molasses in the nose, tempered by a roasted coffee bitterness. Not so much coffee as coffee grounds, the elemental parts of a cup. Sweet, with just a hint of alcohol.
Bracing bitterness from the roasted coffee comes through in the taste. Deep sweetness from the molasses. Some chocolate, but what really sticks out is the vanilla presence from the -bal. There's just the slightest burn here - honestly, this could use a touch more alcohol, but as it stands it does a phenomenal job masking the ABV.
The mouthfeel is so, so good: thick and viscous, with just enough carbonation to help the flavors open up. This is a work of brewing art.
It's infuriating that this beer is so readily available across broad swaths of this nation. I'll be perpetually ISO until Deschutes distributes here. 1,229 charactersamphion1065, Jul 23, 2011

Strong, smoky aroma has tones of molasses, wood, bourbon, licorice and semi-sweet chocolate. It pours midnight-black with a thick and rather persistent fine-bubbled tan head that leaves substantial lacing. Flavor is beyond delicious - rich and smoky with tones of molasses, licorice, toffee, caramel, quality coffee, nuts and chocolate. It seems as though each sip is a little different. Thick, smooth flavor has a firm fizz that leaves a persistent tingle to go along with a smoky, nutty, mocha finish. This beer is worth a drive all the way to Oregon! 696 charactersCyberkedi, Jul 22, 2011

Pours black with a medium tan head. 
The aroma is dark roasted malts with molasses, licorice, oak, and alcohol (stronger when fresh). 
The flavor has a big dark roasted malt base with molasses, anise, dark chocolate, black coffee, earthy bitterness, light hints of oak and bourbon and alcohol. 
Full bodied with moderate carbonation. There is no mistaking that this is a big beer. A great sipper on a fall evening (although I would drink this anytime). 
I have enjoyed this each time including a vertical from 06-08. At the time, the consensus was for the 07 batch. This is a standout beer. On a side note, the 2009 batch that I tried was not very good. The 2010 batch returned to good form and was very tasty. 781 charactersajsdad06, Jul 20, 2011

09'= BEST AFTER: 11/1/2010
10'= BEST AFTER: 11/15/2011
Aroma- 09' Big Espresso and musky with an oak finish. 10' Bourbon and oaky! Tons of malt and tons of aroma. Complexed!
Appearance- 09' Pours a 2.5 finger, dark tan head with a great retention. Body is the deepest brown you can get. Nice lacing. 10' Less than 1 finger of dark brown head that has no retention. Opaque, Deep Brown color body and leaves minimal lace. Hmmm. More of a motor oil look! 
Flavor- 09' Espresso, Rich, and deep with complexity and good hop bitterness with malt at the finish... Too much to grab with 10 sips, 11 sips, 12 sips, oh, its gone.. AWESOME! 10' Nice coffee and then a huge grainy flavor. A deep prune character is present and then a nice bitterness. VERY BIG alcohol presence here. Cool.
Mouthfeel- 09' Full Bodied, Medium Carbonation, Great texture and finish. Very Chewy throughout and know this is too much body for the style but still appreciate. 10' Full Bodied, Medium-High Carbonation, Deep, and leaves coffee on the palate. Thick, like motor oil and can't get enough!
Overall Impression- The 2010 version was better than 2009!?!? I thought from the beginning this result would be the opposite! Both were full bodied, espresso based, thick, and a beer to sip on for a ton of time! WOW! I can't believe either of these! No wonder they are talked about so much! I wish they could sell these to-go @ Naja's Place but will have to look for somewhere else. FIND! It's the Best Stout Ever! 1,666 charactersDCon, Jul 14, 2011

Nice viscous pour with a thick, oily presence and a dark tan head. It's is a wonderful stout with licorice and molasses flavors, like the label says! The 33% aged in oak barrels really comes through and makes for a unique brew. The 11% ABV doesn't even seem apparent since it's so easy on the palette. I love that licorice and anise note on the flavor that really coats the tongue. This is a nice bottle fresh or aged, and the 2010 is no exception. 489 characterskayalla, Jul 12, 2011
4.62/5  rDev +3.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Had this 2010 bottle at a stout night with friends. It was Ivan, Abyss, Darkness, and Dark Lord, in that order. We had pretzels and water and some Goose Island Summertime in between rounds.
This pours deep black with a little half finger espresso crema head leaving a little lace as it dies. On the nose there is rich espresso, cacao nibs, deeply roasted malt, and slight bourbon undertones. This is a great nose, totally different than the other three beers that night. In the mouth the espresso and chocolate are perfectly in balance. It seemed a bit less sweet than the others, probably due to a lack of the heavy molasses notes that dominate the others, or perhaps due to a more pronounced coffee bitterness counteracting the sweeter flavors. There might be some hop-type bitterness too. It's a really rich taste that I'm going to have to spend more time with to really understand it. The body is full with a long finish, slightly warming from the bourbon and general alcohol content, with the bitter and sweeter notes mixing together very well for quite some time.
Overall, this is a very fine stout, one of the better ones I've had. It was by far the most unique one of the four that we had, and I guess now I see why this is classed as an American big stout rather than a Russian Imperial. Great beer.
EDIT - I just drank my first 2011 bottle, and it's amazing fresh. The smell is unreal.
EDIT 2 - I've been frequenting my local place, where they've got 2010 Abyss on tap for $5 a pint. Very fine at a year old. I could almost just smell the beer. 1,558 charactersEricCioe, Jul 10, 2011

A - Pours pitch black with a finger of dark tan head. Looks amazing, very impressed with the head retention after three years.
S - First scent is a blend of chocolate and soy sauce, but not in a bad way at all. Those are followed by a burnt coffee smell along with the slightest hint of bourbon vanilla.
T - Taste starts with heavy soy sauce. This is quickly followed by a brief hint of chocolate and a heavy dose of harshly burnt coffee. The finish brings out the bourbon vanilla to accompany the coffee.
M - Slightly less thick than the appearance would suggest, though every bit as carbonated as it poured. This is also one of the warmer beers I've had with a nice burn all the way down.
O - Overall a fantastic beer. Glad to try an older vintage! 891 charactersMarkIntihar, Jul 08, 2011

Smell is bitter roasted malts, sweet molasses, a little bourbon and alcohol heat.
Taste upfront is bitter roasted malts, a little bourbon and wood, and some molasses sweetness. Light licorice in the middle. Sweeter finish of molasses, raisin fruitiness and a hint of bourbon. Lingering roasted coffee bitterness.
Full bodied and velvety smooth. Medium carbonation with a somewhat bubbly finish.
Better than the other two 2009 bottles I've had, but still not that impressive. Body could be fuller and less carbonated. Very little bourbon presence. Good, but not amazing.

S-very dark roasted coffee. embarrassing to say, but possibly a hint of bacon in there. medium strength. pretty run of the mill so far.
T-definitely a serious stout. it hits the tongue with a very smooth taste of very dark roasted coffee along with some chocolate. its a very rich and oily taste that sticks to the tongue in a great way. it transitions in to a good matching after-taste in which you can taste the bourbon and oak. i'll be honest, there's a good mix of big flavors here that seem to change order with every sip you take.
M-very thick and heavy. there's a good medium carbonation with a very crisp finish
O-what should be sips will turn in to quaffs with this one. this is a seriously complex stout. it also drinks very easily for the ABV. i wouldn't mind having a full stock of this. craving will ensue i'm sure. 926 charactersAdamBear, Jul 04, 2011

Pours a really dark, thick, black, with a bit of deep brown at the edges. Brought to me with a minimal dark tan head. Fantastic lacing.
Smell is a feast for the nose. Wonderful dark roasted malts, with chocolate as the dominant aroma, but so much more than that. This is just about the best-smelling unadulterated stout I have ever encountered.
Taste is simply amazing. Dark roasted malts, sweet chocolate, a bit of fruit. Kinda boozy (hints of whiskey), but not unpleasantly so. A light bitterness comes on half-way through, and persists through the finish with a nicely balanced sweetness.
Mouthfeel is top-notch. Super-thick, super-heavy, but oh so creamy and wonderful. Medium carbonation, higher than many imperial stouts, and really nice.
This is one of those beers that just makes you say "wow." It is incredibly tasty, and every sip reveals more layers of subtle flavors. No sharp edges, nothing lacking. Just so much rich, sweet, boozy, dark, goodness. I took over half an hour to drink my 10-oz. pour, because I just wanted to savor every little bit of it. One of the best beers I've ever had. 1,237 characterszeledonia, Jul 02, 2011

A: Oil black viscous pour creating almost no head. The little appearing head was a nice deep mocha brown. Minor alcohol legs in this beer made all the more desirable. 
S: Great aroma to this brew. Huge roasted notes with a sweet chocolate presence. A little bourbon thrown in there with a big coffee forward note.
T: Similar to the aroma. Huge roasted qualities, less chocolate than the aroma and the bourbon I mentioned was slight. Molasses was evident as well as a big coffee wave.
M: A little over carbonated for my taste and it threw off the smoothness of the brew. I did like how thick this brew was. Medium bodied made up for the carbonation.
O: I enjoyed Abyss. For me, the only real negatives were the coffee notes and the carbonation. I don't drink coffee ever but I will say I like this beer. I wish I could have tried it on tap. 898 charactersshawnp, Jun 28, 2011

This is a 2009 vintage. There have been many claims that some of the 2009 bottles of The Abyss are infected, so I am holding my breath that this is not one of them. I last tried this vintage in Dec 2009 when it was “fresh” and there were no signs of infection at that time. However, this is a different bottle and has aged at least 16 months, which could have given any nasty bugs time to do their dirty work.
So here it goes.
A: As I removed the cap I heard a faint hiss. So far no signs or scents of an infected brew.
The beer poured a very dark deep brown to midnight black with a 2 finger dark tan head which dissipated by the time I was half way thru my glass and left a minimal lacing on the glass, so far no odd smells. 
S: After taking a deep whiff from my glass I’m sure this in not infected as all I got from the nose was bourbon, chocolate, molasses, vanilla and some coffee. 
T: The taste was like the nose, I got bitter chocolate, molasses, mild bourbon notes and vanilla plus I was able to pick up some of the black licorice flavor which I love. 
M: The beer had a medium to thick slick mouthfeel with a nice carbonation level. 
D&O: The drinkability of this 11% abv brew was very good with minimal heat from the alcohol. 
I’m glad I got a “good” bottle, now I have to hope my others are good too. I’m looking forward to doing a vertical tasting in 2013, as I have the ’06, ’07, ’08 & ’09, now all I need is the ’10, ’11,’12 & ’13! 1,550 charactersuturn, Jun 27, 2011

The beer poured a dark pitch into a Maudite snifter with two fingers of root beer-float colored head. It took it a couple of minutes, but the head subsided leaving a fair amount of sticky clingy lacing along the sides of the glass. The smell was pleasant, but a tad to subtle for me. There were notes of chocolate, roasted malt, slight coffee and trace amount of oak and bourbon. The taste was fantastic. Well balanced rich chocolate, molasses, vanilla and a hint of licorice and bourbon. There was a slight hoppy bitterness to it as sell It had a thick and chewy mouthfeel, with light carbonation and a great creaminess that coated my mouth.

O- A super complex beer, that is as delicious as I expected, and I had really high expectations. I looked back at the bottle and noticed the addition of licorice and molasses, and my only complaint is that these weren't strong enough flavors to make me notice them before reading that (though the molasses gets kind of subdued into the rest of the sweet flavors). This is quite the beer. 1,072 characterszdk9, Jun 20, 2011

Poured into a mini-stem glass, this beer was dark as the abyss from whence comes its name. A dark brown head redeced to a patchy ring. Lots and lots of chocolate in the aroma, sweet chocolate, with notes of coffee and molasses just barely noticeable and the chocolate fully taking over. More sweet chocolate in the taste, followed by coffee bitterness, caramel, licorice and molasses, dark fruits. After a few sips, the booze starts to emerge, and there is a definite alcohol burn. Finishes pretty woody, dry and bitter. Smooth, silky, full-bodied, and very drinkable. 615 charactersRifugium, Jun 10, 2011

Look: Beautiful dark purple color with and 1 inch head and beautiful lacing that followed the beer all the way down the last sip
Smell: Beautiful notes of chocolate, dark plums, coffee and a hint of vanilla that make the aroma something that you smell time and time again while drinking
Taste: This is the most well balanced Imperial stout that I have had to date. The flavors worked in perfect harmony together. A true masterpiece and work of art
Mouthfeel: Medium to full body with an amazing silkyness that coats the palate and allows the beautiful flavors to linger on
Overall: This beer is damn close to perfection in my opinion especially for the style. I would recommend buying this and then just giving it to me so I can have it in my fridge all year long. Well done Deschutes on this true masterpiece 835 charactersDarthKostrizer, Jun 09, 2011

Pours super dark and thick with very little head. Rough pour turns up a slow, dark tan cascade. Nose is impeccable, super barrel-y with lots of wood notes and some vanilla. Palate is thick and viscous and rich. Slick vanilla bean, roasted black malts, coffee extract and all things delicious.

appearance - oily, black, hints of brown on the edges. good one inch mocha head. beautiful lacing for an imperial stout.
smell -chocolate, alcohol, oak, roasted malts, hardly getting any licorice this time around. as it warms more roasted malts, minor vanilla.
taste - much the same with a bit of toffee. and much more vanilla and caramel as it warms.
mouthfeel - creamy and smooth. good carbonation, which will hopefully die out a bit and thicken it up even more. alcohol is dominating too much. 644 charactersclaytong, Jun 07, 2011

4.67/5  rDev +4.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Thank you chugalug06 for the trade!
From a 22 oz. 2010 Reserve bottle poured into a Duvel Tulip Style Glass. Pours out dark, mostly all black with some slight brown around only the shallow edges. Picture the color of motor oil about 2/3 way though it's life, but obviously not the consistency. There is a dark brown head that gives some decent lacing. It actually continues, the liquid itself is very thick so there's a good amount of glass retention on each sip.
Smell is very good, it has a lot going on. It has the classic Russian Imperial Stout characteristics of fudgey dark chocolate malt tones and then some. The bottle indicates the beer is brewed with licorice and molasses, that is certainly picked up in the aroma. There isn't a strong, but slight hint of black coffee as well, not much but a slight bourbon hint. There is a slight hint of something a little funky fermentation that I can't quite put my finger on. All of the aromas blend together nicely, it's pretty good.
The flavor is outstanding and quite unique. Plenty of roasted malts here producing chocolate, coffee (maybe even espresso), molasses, vanilla, and maybe even some caramel flavors, there's certainly plenty of sweetness. Bourbon and some slight woody notes. Can't detect the licorice in the flavor as the smell. There is a slight tartness to it, almost like a sour cherry flavor. Like the smell it's all blended very well.
Mouthfeel is close to perfect. Full bodied and well balanced overall. Very smooth with a good carbonation level. Slight warmth from the alcohol. Very complex to the mouth with all the flavors but manages a slight bitter bite at the end which is very nice. Very drinkable, but it would be tough to polish off a bottle yourself, if you do, dont' expect to do a whole lot that night, it could take awhile, especially if you want to enjoy it properly. A very good beer. I'm glad I have another bottle to let sit for awhile. This beer certainly lives up to the hype, I'm glad I finally got the opportunity to try it. 2,021 charactersAndyAvalanche, Jun 04, 2011
4.84/5  rDev +8%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 52010 vintage, got in a trade from dpchuger and cellared since the release. Served in a Southampton IRS release day snifter. 
Look: solid, black body with dark red highlights around the edge of the glass when held to the light. Thin, reddish brown head forms with good retention but not a whole lot in terms of lacing. Good looking stout.
Smell: rich aroma with a big brownie batter aroma, chocolatey, a bit of licorice, and a light bourbon barrel smell. Of all the barrel aged stouts I've had, this might be the best smelling. Exceptional. 
Taste: follows the nose with roasted chocolate, a small bit of bourbon and oak, a slight tannic taste, some licorice and molasses with a bit of vanilla as well. A good level of complexity, nothing is overdone, and everything is done well. Very, very great. 
Feel: a little on the thin side, but still medium-full, light alcohol presence, dry, and slightly astringently bitter. Moderate carbonation. I can't give it higher than a 4 though, because an 11% stout needs to have more body, but otherwise, quite good. Its a sipper because you want to savor this beer, the same way you would take your time eating a decadent slice of cake. 
Overall: a really amazing stout, certainly worth all the hype. I'm glad that I received this in a trade and wish that Deschutes distributed to New York so I could buy this by the case. If you haven't had this yet, what are you waiting for? Cheers! 1,427 charactersSkunkWorks, Jun 04, 2011
4.95/5  rDev +10.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 52010 Vintage. Poured into a Portsmouth Tulip.
A- Pours a deep and dark black body with an ever so slight reddish hue around the edges. Nice 2-finger coffee colored head that last for a while before falling to a pretty thick cap. Absolutely beautiful. Damn fine lacing all the way down.
S- Deep roasted chocolate, slight bourbon, vanilla oak, and licorice and molasses. None of the 11% abv.
T- WOW! Licorice and molasses finishes after the deep roasted chocolate and vanilla and sweet espresso. A very nice woody flavor.
MF- A full body, but just a tad bit thinner than expected. The flavors coat the palate amazingly and the flavors stick around for a long time. Nonetheless, very creamy and thick.
O- Overall, this was one hell of an amazing beer, one of the best, if not the best, I've ever had. Looking forward to seeing what some time does for it! I really can't believe how well they hide the ABV, it really plays no part in the aroma or the taste, beware!

2009 Vintage. A year and a half old. Crossing my fingers on this one...
A- 5- Pitch black with 3-fingers chocolate colored head with very good retention and lace.
S- 4.5- Whoo Hoo! Nice oakey vanilla, burnt bittersweet chocolate, molasses, anise. No abv present.
T-5- More of the smell and again, none of the abv present. Carefull with it.
MF-5- Very big and creamy.
O- 4.5- Very relieved to have a good bottle with no signs of any infection. A very good beer with 1.5 years on it. Have to put my other 2010 away for a while... 1,503 charactersLtCracker20, Jun 03, 2011
4.01/5  rDev -10.5%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 42010 Bottle drank in March '11. Review is from my notes.
Served at cellar Temp: 55'F
A- Opaque with a rich, dark brown head. Great retention, a really beautiful beer.
S- A little nutty, rich dark and milk chocolate and light mollasses. Dont smell much bourbon but I believe the bottle says 33% aged in barrels so maybe it will come out more in the taste.
T- Sweet licorice up front followed by sugars from molasses and carmel. Huge roasted malt backbone with chocolate and coffee-espresso being the center of attention. A little bit of sweetness also comes through from the bourbon I suppose. 
M- This is where the beer falls apart for me. Overall the mouthfeel was a little thin. Theres a transient bitterness from the mild hops and alcohol which eventually just becomes heat from the alcohol. My main problem is the dryness that follows. It kept me going back for another sip just yso my mouth wouldnt dry out. Other than that it was perfectly carbonated.
O- Rich maltiness and sweet from the bourbon and licorice. A descent beer but I'm not sure if I would go out of my way for another. I have a few more in the cellar so perhaps I'll give it a few more months to see how it develops. 1,193 charactersMikeyMikee, Jun 02, 2011

A: This looks like an Exxon valdez rampage. Pure black with shimmering darkness like the gulf of mexico. Huge khaki carbonation with sticky lacing. If you spill this on your clothes, just throw them out. No middle carbonation, at least not much that I can see.
S: There is a huge chocolate profile, not similar to most stouts, it registers sweeter more of a syrupy bitterness like those bags of syrup you add to soda machines but with a ton of awesome coffee balance. As a side note, I feel like Deschutes sometimes ends up with too much sugar attenuation and they defy the status quo here with this chocolate syrupy note that remains balanced.
T: Very sweet on the first taste that coats the bitter zones with an overwhelming hop presence that subsides into a tarpit of gooey coffee notes. The heat is there but the alcohol is overridden by almost distracting sweet notes. It is reminiscent of if you subjected a normal stout to a 120 min boil. It just feels like stout concentrate in a good way.
M: I can’t overstate this enough, it coats harder than a single guy at 1:45 a.m. at a club. Chocolate robitussin with teeth staining presence. It will linger with you, whether you want it to or not.
D: I don’t know what crazy cold conditions or type of Siberian misery that I would have to endure to put away several bottles of this away. Perhaps the people in Bend Oregon have a tough gulag life that I can’t comprehend from my Mediterranean climate throne but one 22 oz bottle of this is plenty, anyone who “wishes” for another bomber seems questionable, but understandable.

The chocolate crude gurgled up to his jaw line and Warren reflected, “perhaps the basement lock was not the way to cut costs either, here I am, 3 floors down, about to endure the prophetic Death By Chocolate, to be honest, I kinda always knew that it would end this way.” He exhaled into the mucilaginous depths watching the bubbles struggle to the surface. “A sweet death, to be sure, but who will finish my screen pl-” 2,499 charactersSubpoenaDeuces, Jun 02, 2011

2010 vintage with a "best after" date of 11/15/11. (eh, couldn't wait.)
300th review.
pours your standard imperial stout-used motor oil black while yielding 3/4" of a thick, creamy, mocha toned head. retention is very respectable for the style, as is the lacing.
the nose is just delicious. big bold notes of chocolate, coffee, and roasted malt with secondary elements of licorice and molasses, maybe a little bourbon. mouth-watering.
taste follows the aroma closely with lots of the aforementioned; a touch of vanilla i missed in the nose. and while there's a splash of booziness in the finish, otherwise the 11% ABV is well-hidden. to be sure, this is a tasty, decadent brew.
great mouthfeel, velvety with a medium-full body; average carbonation.
overall, well, i told myself i wouldn't be swayed by the hype but in the end? yeah this is a world class beer. no question. 913 charactersperrymarcus, Jun 02, 2011
4.28/5  rDev -4.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 42009 vintage poured into a Saint Arnold’s sniffer
Appearance: Black with a thick tan head…that’s the way an imperial stout should look like.
Aroma: This is the part that made me worry, there was the very distinct sour aroma emanating from the bottle. After it was poured I could detect other aromas, vanilla, licorice, coffee, chocolate, and the slight sour aroma, which was not overwhelming, but did add some character. 
Taste: Incredibly complex, coffee, dark chocolate, toffee, oak, licorice. The sour aroma was barely provided any sour taste. The sourness from the infection was more like a stout aged on cherries, then one that was infected.
Mouthfeel: Thick and rich with medium carbonation. This one is a sipper for sure, yet there is no apparent alcohol.
Overall: Even though it was infected it was still very good. I can’t wait to break into one of me 2010 bottles and get to experience this one in all of its glory. 938 charactersjamescain, Jun 01, 2011

Taste is less licorice than it's aroma suggests, but it's there, along with a smooth chocolate and light smokey flavor. The aftertaste is a slight licorice & chocolate.

4.45/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Finally have the chance and occasion to enjoy one of my 2010 Vintages. Up in the Northwoods WI for Memorial Day weekend.
Poured from a bomber into a Delirium snifter.
Pours a very deep, dark brown that is almost black. Less than a fingers worth of orange tinted mocha head dissipates quickly and leaves oily lacing with a few spots. The nose is chocolate, bourbon, and alcohol. All are quite bold in their expression. The taste has a great profile.
 Thick licorice and chocolate flavors fill my palate and stick there. This stuff is thick. The bourbon characteristics are shining through just enough to add the flavors without masking the dessert like qualities. There is a molasses flavor melded into the mix the adds to the sweetness of The Abyss. 
The flavors cling to my mouth and stay there thanks to the viscous, oily texture. Carbonation is surprisingly high for such a brew but pleasent nonetheless.
So glad to have finally tried this beast and cant wait to try an aged '10! Great flavors and aromas but a bit hot still. Not unbearably so but certainly present. Great beer that fills the belly. 1,106 charactersChugginOil, May 30, 2011
5/5  rDev +11.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This is my 100th review and I really wanted to pick something special to me for the occasion. 2010 vintage, poured a thick viscous black into my large tulip glass. As dark and light sucking as a beer can be. Nothing at the edges at all. Head is two fingers of luscious dark brown, dolloped yummyness!! Laces very well considering the 11% abv.
Smell is complete heaven. Dark roasted coffee and a bit of dark chocolate with a sweet molasses undertones. Tart smells of boysenberry jam. Alcohol is definitely present. The bourbon barrels show up here too. Unmatched in my opinion!!
Taste is dark, dark, dark roasted malt. My tongue and senses interpret these flavors as licorice, molasses, coffee and just a hint of chocolate. There is quite a bit of tart flavor also some bourbon notes. This should be the standard for all bourbon barrel aged Imperial Russian Stouts.
Mouth is what I wish every beer would be. Rich and luscious, syrupy and chewy. Carbonation is perfect for an Imperial Stout. I love this!!
This is not my first Abyss, I enjoyed '08 and '09 (pre infection) but never got around to reviewing them. So I think it's only fair that I review this over it's lifetime with me. This is the stout by which I measure all other Imperial Stouts. It's perfect!!! 1,266 charactersazdback, May 29, 2011

A: Pours so black that a bright light behind the glass is unable to penetrate its depths. Massive, tight tan head rises, sticks around for a few moments and then slowly recedes, leaving behind significant tan lacing. Effervescence? Who knows.
S: Smell is almost too subdued: licorice, roast/smoke malts and chocolate. If I dig, I come up with oak. 
T: Sweet molasses and chocolate, then licorice, bitter chocolate and roast take hold and do not let go. Nothing fruity about this beer at this age. Strong bitterness, which is probably tapping down sweet malts and works really well with chocolatey malts. Finish is very bitter. A hint of smoke shows on the tail end. The barrel-aging/wood-aging is subtle but brings a note of oak wood that adds to The Abyss' overall complexity. 
M: Big bodied with medium-light carbonation. Somewhat mouthcoating. Definitely warming. Powdery, semi-dry in the finish.
O: The Abyss is a much better beer than its smell would have me believe. Quite complex, and somewhat extreme, but still classic in its elements. An excellent American double stout.
Thank you to my many trading partners who contributed enough bottles to my cellar that I could drink this treat by myself on a rainy and chilly Saturday night in late May. Cheers! 1,309 charactersWadsey, May 29, 2011

First and foremost, this is a really kick butt beer...one will do you. There is absence of light from this beer...black is back. Almost two finger foam, yes thick tan foam. Clingy lace, not without shape, but mostly in rings. Smell is to knock your socks off...Aromas of slightly charred barley sweet malt, cocoa, molasses, maple syrup, and coffee. Taste is enveloping, bombarded with flavors of chocolate, clover, French roast coffee, mint leaf, spices, malt, grapefruit, and pine nuts. Velvet smoothness as this brew passes over my tongue and back throat. Some coating, with aftertaste of coco and coffee. A little pricey for every day consumption, but great as a treat or for a special occasion. 793 charactersbeerprovedwright, May 23, 2011

Appearance - Has a very dark pour with a rich creamy head, leaves a beautiful lace residue on inside of glass.
Smell - The aroma is very balanced and subtle with smells of cocoa, malt, vanilla , and oak. There was no distinct overpowering ingredients. Smells very sweet almost like butterscotch. Mmm butterscotch...
Taste - Starts with a very smooth bitter chocolate coffee flavor as it hides the alcohol very well. The more you taste the more complex the flavors get. Towards the end it started tasting like a espresso with a very rich caramel taste to it. 
Mouthfeel - Smooth and creamy and leaves a nice feeling after sipping.
Overall - Very good beer and glad I was able to try this. It's very complex as it gives you different flavors after every sip. 951 charactersdvsbizzyb, May 21, 2011

4.3/5  rDev -4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.52010 Vintage in Duvel Tulip 
Appearance: Pours viscous as hell. Not quite Bourbon County thick, but close. Motor oil black; absolutely no translucency. Nice chocolate colored, 1 finger head with a moderate pour. Head dissipates quickly. Minimal lacing follows the beer down the glass.
Smell: Chocolate, coffee, and vanilla initially; bourbon detectable in the background. Bourbon presence becomes more prominent as the beer warms. 
Taste: Hits the tongue sweet with milk chocolate, licorice and vanilla. Coffee and bitter dark chocolate follow, giving the beer a pleasant, roasty finish. The combination of licorice and molasses imparted sweetness and noticeable roast character are quite unique. The barrel aging is most apparent initially as vanilla. Consistent with the aroma, bourbon becomes more detectable as the beer warms, although it still plays more of a backseat, complimentary role compared to other more bourbon forward barrel aged stouts. There is certainly a fair amount to comprehend in the flavor profile. This bottle is still relatively young and with time, everything will incorporate more cohesively. 
Mouthfeel: The apparent thickness from the pour carries into the mouth. Again, not Bourbon County thick, but this is definitely among the more viscous stouts. 
Overall: Overall an extremely enjoyable and somewhat unique beer drinking experience. There is a lot going on with this one and to be fair, this bottle has not yet reached the brewers "best after" date. With a bit more time, I anticipate the flavors integrating somewhat and creating a more refined final product. However, this should not be read to indicate the flavor profile lacks in some way. This is a delicious and extremely enjoyable beer drinking experience. I am glad I cracked one at this stage to appreciate how complex it truly is, but also glad I have another to taste at a stage when that complexity has reached its peak. 1,922 charactersdbc5, May 18, 2011

Heading into the tasting, this was all of our favorite brew. List included 2010 Darklord, Rare Bourbon County Stout, 2011 KBS, 2011 Hunahpu, 2010 Abyss.
A- Pours like the black of night with a finger tan head that disappears slowly into the depths of the Abyss. Left some very nice lacing on the glass. Very thick with decent carbonation. 
S- Chocolate malt, dried fruit, espresso. Can't get enough of this smell.
T- Taste was exceptional and got better as it warmed up. Sweet roasted malt taste with a touch of molasses and vanilla as it warmed up. Alcohol was undetectable and very well hidden.
M- Mouthfeel is smooth and thick. Decent amount of carbonation. 
O- Overall, even thought it scored so low, this is still on of my favorite beers that I've tasted. I believe the beer becomes more balanced and complex as it warms up. I have several bottles in my cellar and can't wait to see what a year or two does to this special brew. 1,063 charactersDevi0us, May 17, 2011

served into snifter at cellar temp.
Color: Dark brown to almost a solid black. A dime thin tan head that leaves behind some medium lacing. This beer also has a good amount of carbonation.
Nose: A plethora of smells attack the nose. Charred wood and sweet vanilla penetrate first followed by a mild scent of Bourbon. Maple syrup is also present and it is balanced well with the robust black coffee in this beer.
Palate: Full bodied beer with a robust presence. A big beer with plenty texture and complex flavor. Molasses makes an appearance as does licorice(black). the alcohol is well masked in this beer making this beer very drinkable.
Finish: Long and bold. It finishes with waves of different flavors. bourbon first followed by molasses and coffee, and then the vanilla soothes everything making this beer epic and majestic.

A - Pours somewhat clear with a dark brown/almost black color and a nice mocha head of about a half finger high and leaving behind a bit of lacing on the glass.
S - Milk chocolate, molasses, dark chocolates. Creamy smooth aroma.
T - Way more bitter than it smells. Hoppy, very roasty, a bit rough...dark chocolate and a barely noticeable boozy aspect.
M - Medium/full bodied with a light/medium carbonation. Creamy, bitterness is a bit on the harsh side...no real warmth.
O - Smells amazing, flavors are good, but didn't hold up to the aroma for me completely. Very bitter and a bit harsh overall, but still quite good. Finished in the middle of the pack for our tasting.
22oz bottle (2009 version) shared with nonstick. Received in trade with barrydotcom. Thanks Barry! Poured into a Portsmouth goblet.
A - Pours a deep pitch black, totally opaque. Small head of tan, dissipates quickly - leaves behind a thin, tan collar.
S - Sweet, a touch of bourbon, some alcohol. Some burnt and dark roasted malts. Some coolness in the nose from licorice. A touch of smoke and a bit of molasses as it starts to warm a bit.
T - Very roasty and just a touch of smokiness in the flavor, just a hint of bourbon. Licorice, burnt malt, coffee. A touch boozy...
M - Medium bodied, and medium to low carbonation. Has a nice, silky feel. A bit oily on the tongue...pretty nice
D - Not a quick drinker, but oh, so good! Excellent RIS...highly recommended. Glad to have another bottle or two of this. think I'll age one to see how this is in another year. 1,641 charactersportia99, May 16, 2011

Deep and dark with a tall chocolate milk head. Amazingly dark given that this isn’t motor oil. Liquorish and bourbon mix to create this sweet vanilla note with a slight oak finish. This is almost candy bourbon with a dark chocolate vs say a bourbon ball with milk chocolate. 
Light oak notes open this one up. A bit cool still to go into detail. Liquorish and bourbon mix to create this sweet vanilla note with a slight oak finish. This is almost candy bourbon with a dark chocolate vs say a bourbon ball with milk chocolate. 
I see why people age this beer, the barrel blending gives off very overt layers of flavors that will blend wonderfully and a touch of alcohol that will mellow. Opens with a dark malt chocolate like profile. The flavor then goes to wet odd hop liquorish flavor that isn’t ideal. Finally the beer switches to a nice oaked bourbon aged beer. Warming up this no longer has the distinct beginning middle and finish. I’d never thought about liquorish and bourbon going together but I like this combo. BTW what does 33% brewed in oak and oak bourbon barrels? Is that 1/3 of this beer was in half oak and half bourbon barrels? Or do they use oak sometimes and bourbon barrels (which are oak) other times? This beer needs a bit more something to balance the molasses and licorice sweetness, and this blend of bourbon doesn’t add enough of that oak and woody note to finish it. 
Certainly a dense beer, but of the imperial stouts I’d say this is medium or medium high density. More carbonation than average here works well.
I have a hard time seeing this as a top 20 beer. It is truly wonderful and I am amazingly thankful that I was able to get this in a trade but I think this beer’s ranking it a touch higher. That said everyone should have this beer at least once given the reasonable price. Now noticing the best after date and wondering how I missed that. Well I suppose I need another bottle, anyone? Overall a bit too sweet imo and that won't be helped with age. That said some blending of flavors could dramatically improve things. 2,205 charactersbobhits, May 15, 2011

2009 bottle, poured into a snifter... with an immediate sigh of relief that it was not an infected bottle.
poured a dark thick black - like motor oil. black as night. black as death. black as an... abyss?
had a bit of a brown creamy head that stayed around for a bit.
the smell was of roasted coffee and dark chocolate. the kind of chocolate you get at specialty shops that are 95% dark. some bourbon in the backgrounds.
the taste mimic'd the smell: dark chocolate and coffee. roasty. oaky. thick. left an enjoyable aftertaste that stuck around. a bit of alcohol warmth - seemed very mellow probably from being a 2 year old bottle. still definitely a sipping beer.
overall, a very enjoyable beer. would like to try some of the other vintages to compare. 881 charactersThoreauLikeAGirl, May 12, 2011

Pours a rich dark brownish black with a nice finger thick head. Smells of malt and black licorice goodness. Tastes like a smokey, excellent stout with the right amount of malt and black licorice, nothing too overpowering. Mouthfeel is great. Effervescent enough to encourage tasting all the tiny component of Abyss on your front and back palate. Drinkability is exceptional. Overall good beer. 428 characterstrodersark, May 10, 2011

4.15/5  rDev -7.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Was essentially just given this from Alpar! 2010 bottle poured into a Stolzle Beer Glass to celebrate my first day at a new job.
Pours almost pitch black, just a hint of a lightbulb will make it through. Nice creamy hocolate head that stays for a little bit and fades leaving some nice lacing
Smells great. A bit of the barrel, some chocolate and a bunch of alcohol. The best drinking date is a half of a year off so I attribute that to me being a little impatient as they told me to wait.
The taste bounces back between the chocolate from the smell and the barrel. It seems hot to me right now though, but maybe that is just me. As it warms everything becomes more pronounced.
This feels great in the mouth though. Velvet smooth with a backing of heat and good balanced carbonation make it everything I'd expect.
This will only get better right now, but seems available enough that you should drink one now to compare to later. Another vertical I want to, but don't need to start. 986 charactersbenpopper, May 07, 2011
4/5  rDev -10.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 42007 bottle opened the night before DLD.
Pours like, well, an Abyss - black, viscous, tan head. Looks good. The nose is coffee, bitter chocolate, maybe a hint of caramel and some wood. No booziness present. Smells good. Taste is dark chocolate, caramel malts, wood and a hint of coffee. Again, no hint of booziness, which is impressive. The flavor is actually somewhat mild in comparison to my expectations. Not as rich as I was expecting, but definitely balanced and surprisingly drinkable. Could have used a touch more oomph. The mouthfeel was somewhat heavy with a medium carbonation. Seemed right for the beer. Overall this is definitely a good beer, but I don't understand the overwhelming acclaim. In a night with several other great beers, this quickly became forgettable. 780 charactersseeswo, May 07, 2011
3.88/5  rDev -13.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Poured from the black waxed 22 ounce bottle, shared into two tulips.
A: Well, it's a dark abyss in there - pitch black body with some extremely dark coffee brown around the edges. Creamy, bubbly tan head that lingers around and leaves some great lacing.
S: Oak chips, roasted coffee, bakers chocolate and some sticky caramel malt. No real hints of "licorice" as described on the bottle, but a really nice nose. Perhaps the oak/wood notes come off a bit too strong for me, but it is very well blended and balanced, just not perfect.
T: Sticky molasses sets things off followed by heavy oak notes. I feel this is really centric on the oak, not necessarily ideal for a completely balanced flavor profile. Bitter roasted coffee and semi-sweet chocolate come through as this warms.
M: Viscous, creamy, great carbonation, almost perfect.
Abyss is a fantastic example of barrel aging and will only improve with time. Even though there's no alcohol heat on the palate, the nose does display some - something I think time can assist nicely with. 1,041 charactersShanePB, May 07, 2011
4.29/5  rDev -4.2%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 422oz into a tulip. Pours a ruby hued well used motor oil, shiny and slick. Minor dark chocolate milkshake colored head lasts briefly, lacing unexceptional.
Aroma is classic american imperial, rich with sweetened charred dark malts. Yes, the molasses and licorice are prominent and wonderful but the barrel not so much.
Taste reveals the barrel. Many flavor notes can be discerned, roasty coffee, molasses, caramel and chocolate. The alcohol was nowhere to be found, bitterness is minimal. Long lasting delicious aftertaste, warms perfectly. Full bodied creamy mouthfeel.

A. Poured a 2 finger tark tan head. Very thick glass coating lacing. Excellent retention. color is black. Looks exactly like an Imperial Stout should. 
S. Coffee, chocolate, vanilla, bourbon. Great smelling stout. Very balanced and smooth with a lot of complexity going on. I really like the fairly strong vanilla and oak aroma. 
T. Excellent. A lot going on in the flavor of this beer. Where to begin. Coffee, licorice, molasses, vanilla, oak, roasted malt. I really like the vanilla and oakiness that this beer has. Almost reminds me of another 
M. This might be the only area that the Abyss could be improved upon IMO. Maybe just a litte bit fuller would make it very good. 
O. I really expected this to be an excellent stout given all of the buzz about it. I have to say that it did not dissapoint. One of the most complex and flavorful Imperial Stouts that I have had. I think this beer really showcases what barrel aging can do to a beer. For my flavor preferences this might be one of my favorite stouts. 1,094 characterssiradmiralnelson, May 04, 2011

4.62/5  rDev +3.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5651mL 2010 ed. 
A- The pour is a near black with a healthy, menacing, Martian red head towering up with slow trepidation. Mean, sticky lacing abounds with layers and explosions of harden lava and obsidian. 
N- Nose is already impending something quite special: big vanilla bean ice cream, beautiful vanilla and subtle notes that scream bourbon though bourbon barrel is not a dominant character here. Fresh hazelnut coffee, meaty flank steak, fatty/savory/umami characters take hold in an intoxicating whirlwind. Warm pecan pie, candied street food pecans, and slight spicy alcohol form the crescendo. Almost the superlative nose for imperial stout.
T- Body upfront makes it very obvious this is not an underattenuated milkshake. There is fatty steak and umami character quickly usurped by dry wood, tannins, big licorice, and big oily then dry spicy dark chocolate. Dry, almost soapy palate with obvious bitterness. The ends adds some fresh lemon and sharp tartness. I thought this was so similar to Expedition that I cracked a 3 year old Expy, but the vintage Expy just demolished this bad boy. 
P- Heavy, woody, sharp, spicy, mildly tannic. 
2010 batch I thought was superior to 2009. Didn't have an infected '09 bottle either. 1,234 characterstarheels86, May 04, 2011

A - Poured dark black with one finger of foamy espresso coloured head that slowly disappeared laving some good lacing behind. 
S - Very robust nose full of oak, coffee, brown sugar, bourbon and licorice. 
T - Nice oak and bourbon notes compliment a robust palate of coffee, licorice and brown sugar. The alcohol is slightly noticeable but for the ABV and considering the freshness of this beer, it is actually well hidden. Some bitterness in the finish. 
M - Medium to full body with a nice hearty chew. Light carbonation. Silky and smooth. 
O - This was superb. Definitely lived up the very high expectations that I had for this beer. 697 charactersTheSevenDuffs, May 04, 2011

A: Pours a deep, inky black color with a massive two finger thick, dark tan head that takes a couple minute to dissipate and leaves nice lacing.
S: The scent has a lot of dark chocolates, deep roasted malts with some oaky/woody scents and molasses notes are present as well. 
T: The taste is much like the smell, dark chocolates up front with some roasted/charred malts coming through in the middle. The molasses notes come through towards the end with slight bourbon notes. The finish is charred and chocolaty.
M: Full bodied with light carbonation. The feel is thick, chewy and dark chocolates.
D: This is a top tier beer, very well balanced and ages quite well. There is hardly any alcohol noticeable, very smooth, just an overall excellent beer and a must try Imperial Stout. 835 charactersmavbrew, May 03, 2011

S - What an amazing scent. This is the epitome of what I would like a stout to smell like - a perfectly balanced blend of coffee, dark fruits and malts. Wow.
T - Incredibly smooth front with a satisfying amount of alcohol in the finish. Bitter chocolate and malt aftertaste that is pleasant and lingers.

Appearance - As black as the abyss. Big foamy brown head with lots of stick to the lace.
Smell - Deep coffee with some malt and alcohol. Plenty of complexity. You can keep smelling this, getting something different all the time. 
Taste - Delicious. The alcohol is strong, but so well balanced by the coffee characters, that it goes down smooth. No off flavors. Perfect balance. I was expecting an overwhelming bitterness to follow the body, but it never came. 
Mouthfeel - Very silky mouthfeel. Amazing. 
Overall Drinkability - The best stout I've ever had in my life. Perfectly balanced. Smooth in flavor and in mouthfeel. Greatness. Very interesting an complex. Drink it fast though. It'll start to taste like shit pretty quickly when it oxidizes even for a little while. The last pour of the bottle tasted completely different, in a bad way, due to having been sitting on the table for half an hour. 946 charactersZenAgnostic, May 02, 2011

A: Pours pitch black with no light getting through even when held up to the light. Big fluffy light brown head with good retention leaving quite a bit of lacing around glass.
S: Lots of stuff going on in the nose. Roasted barley with molasses, a hint of bourbon, oak and vanilla with alcohol and a hint of licorice. As it warms up the alcohol comes out quite a bit and begins to overpower the other aromas.
T: The licorice comes out in the taste much more than the smell with all of the flavors picked up in the nose coming together wonderfully. Roasted malts, sweet vanilla, thick molasses, chocolate, some licorice with additional complexities coming from the oak and bourbon barrels that help blend all the other flavors together rather than overpower them like many other barrel aged stouts. Very little alcohol is detectable in the taste for an 11% ABV beer. Hop balance is near perfect keeping all of the malty sweetness in check.
M: Mouthfeel is awesome, viscous, slick, super smooth full bodied beer with some carbonation. Wouldn't change a thing.
O: One of my all time favorite stouts. Fantastic all around, I love how you can easily pick out all of the complexities yet they still blend together in perfect harmony. Ridiculously drinkable for an 11% barrel aged imperial stout. Excellent offering from Deschutes. 1,421 charactersAzurescens, Apr 30, 2011

2010 vintage received in yet another great trade with pitasoup. Thanks man!! 
For the style this one looks quite good. Black, completely so, with a nice dark brown head that lasted a bit, leaving plenty of lacing. 
Smell is of plenty of dark, roasty and burnt malts, licorice, dark fruits, anise. Wood and bourbon are also present. 
Taste is damn spectacular, I dare say the perfect tasting American Double stout has been found! Bold roasted malts and ample bourbon come through first, followed by tangy anise and licorice, woody notes, vanilla, and dark fruits. There's some dark chocolate and espresso notes in there too. Extremely complex, flavorful and delicious. A bit of alcohol comes through, but this is expected for the style and ABV. 
Mouthfeel is very thick, smooth, with silky carbonation and a lingering bitterness. Alcohol warms on the way down. 
Drinks quite well. A damn fine beer that's fully worthy of all the hype. It's on my "always wants" list on my profile from now on. 
Thanks Pitasoup!!!! 1,038 charactersAlCaponeJunior, Apr 28, 2011

A: Dark oily pour with decent head at first, but the foam soon subsides. Little to no head retention.
S: Molasses, chocolate, roast and a hint or bourbon aroma with no alcohol kick to ruin it. This smells like a great and inviting beer.
T: The smells don't deceive, but there is a faint alcohol taste. Considering this was only bottled 5 months ago it's not suprising. The roast comes through strong in the end.
M: Nicely carbed with a full body... smooth all the way.
O: Overall a great full bodied beer. Could use some more bourbon flavor and a bit of aging to mellow out the alcohol flavor. Definitely drink again and would probably age the next bottle. 686 charactersdcsoke, Apr 27, 2011

A - Pour had virtually no head, but the bit that was there was very dark khaki. Some lacing. Pitch black. No light penetrates.
S - Some sugary dark malts and chocolate. Faint hops with some coffee.
T - Tastes nearly exactly as it smells, except the coffee is much more forward on the first sip. Brown sugar and chocolate are background flavors with a bit of oak somewhere on the finish. Moderate bitterness, but not overly so.
M - Mouthfeel is perfect. Silky smooth bubbles and full bodied texture. Holds its body well without being overly thick or watery.
O - A great example of the style, but not world class to me. For me I would rather have a speedway stout. I'll drink this one again if it comes across a tap board in my future. 804 charactersdmsohyea, Apr 22, 2011

A - Dark thick looking black, opaque with a bubbly coffee looking head. 
S - Roasty malts come thru with a hint of booze and a ton of complexity. You get some fruits (dates, currants) along with some sweetness hidden in the darkness.
T - Wow, easily the best Imperial Stout I've ever had. Extremely well balanced between roastiness, booziness, sweetness and goodness. So many different things happening I don't even know how to describe it all. Just a hint of the oak they use, but again well balanced and nuanced. 
M - Nice feel rolling on the tongue, not too thick while still having a good ummph. The booze does take away some of the feel, but that is very much a part of the style.
O - Damn, first time taking this ride and really impressed. Of course, its not a daily drinking type beer but clearly they know what they are doing. 943 charactersDijeriduster, Apr 21, 2011
4.73/5  rDev +5.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5My first review, figured I would begin with a bang.
2010 vintage poured from a bottle into a duvel tulip. Pours a very dark black with a dark tan head which dissipates quickly. Lasing was negligible.
Aroma – hints of vanilla, roasted malts, slight bourbon, and very sweet.
Taste – dominate notes of roasted malt/caramel which fades to vanilla and bourbon notes, finally finishing with a roasted coffee/mocha taste. Flavours are incredibly balanced and very palatable. I could not personally distinguish the liquorish(anise) character and the 11% is very well hidden.
It is incredibly smooth with perfect carbonation; resulting in a very creamy texture.
I am personally not particularly found of 100% barrel aged (BA) stouts and found the abyss (33% barrel aged – bourbon notes not overly pronounced) to be perfectly balanced. Though this beer tends to be difficult to acquire especially for those in Canada, it is a perfect gateway to BA stouts. 956 charactersmmurphy525, Apr 19, 2011

A - Pours with one finger of medium brown head on top of an opaque, black body. The foam settles quickly and leaves moderate lace.
S - Lots of chocolate with notes of molasses, earthy licorice, smoke and some vanilla.
T - Sweet chocolate and caramel up front with a little bit of molasses. More chocolate and molasses in the middle with some licorice coffee coming in. The beer finishes with lots of earthy chocolate and spice notes as well as pine hops and coffee. Lingering malt bitterness mixes with bitter chocolate, tobacco, and lots of smoky whiskey.
M - A thick, oily body, moderate carbonation, and a sweet finish.
D - There is a lot of earthy, spicy complexity here, especially in the finish. The aroma really doesn't have much going on until the beer nears room temperature, but once it does the molasses and licorice really begin to come out. I don't get as much whiskey character as I expected, but there is a bit in the finish and it seems to add another note of underlying complexity to what is already a complicated beer. I imagine this would age very gracefully. 1,096 charactersnickfl, Apr 17, 2011

Appearance: Poured from the bottle, the beer is thick, viscous, and a deep dark black. Even with an easy pour, the brew had a good inch of creamy, mocha colored head. The retention was good, and the retention was impressive.
Smell: Nice roasty quality, lots of sweet chocolate. There was some light coffee, but not too much. Really balanced overall...smells great.
Taste: Lots of sweet milk chocolate with a nice roasted malt quality. Not too much in the way of coffee which actually surprised me as I have come to expect some coffee flavor in big stouts. Surprise &lt;&gt; disappointment, this is a great tasting beer.
Mouthfeel: Full body, great creamy texture, smooth and very easy to drink. Ain't nothing wrong here.
Overall (Drinkability): A great tasting brew, and definitely one of the best stouts I've had. Lots of flavor without any single quality being overwhelming, and drinks very well. Absolutely recommend. 1,053 characterskrisandajt, Apr 17, 2011

I don't know why people think this is a terrible beer ('09 vintage): though not what other years' vintages have been, this one is definitely quaffable in my book.

4.88/5  rDev +8.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Marcellar put the Abyss on Nitro and it is awesome. Poured into a snifter at 47 degrees. From my notes I write this review. 
Appearance: The head is a dark tan color and is foamy and creamy; furthermore, the head has really good retention with lacing on the glass. There is a lot of carbonation in the beer, visible from the sides of the glass. The clarity of the glass is opaque; it is like trying to look through tar. There is a lot of lacing on the beer glass. 
Nose: A nice roasted malt, strong coffee, and chocolate aromas. There is a molasses like note with floral ester, resin, biscuit, and toffee. There is also a slight port aroma to the beer. You can smell the burnt character in the beer and the oak. The bourbon barrel age in the beer comes out very brightly and aromatic. 
Taste: A very rich roasted malt, oak, espresso, chocolate, and a molasses are the initial flavors. In the background of the beer there is bread, oak, toffee, and a burnt character in the beer. The age in the bourbon barrel give the beer balance and flavor. The hops is subtle but there is floral, pine, and a hint of grapefruit. 
The mouth feel is a full bodied brew that is very creamy, coating, and smooth. 
Overall: The body of the beer is thick and the finish is full and last for a while on the palate. The beer is very well balanced and beautifully made. With beer being poured on a nitro tap, it just brings a whole new level the beer. There is not much to say, other than a great brew. 1,485 characterscolts9016, Apr 16, 2011
4.8/5  rDev +7.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 52007 Lucky to try this at the deschutes tasting at high times in costa mesa.
Viscous black beer. Looks like the bubbles struggle to make it to the top but a thin dark tan head forms. Swirling in the goblet looks like it's in slow motion it's so heavy.
Smell is absolutely phenomenal. So mellow with a mix of chocolate and molasses syrup. Not too sweet though and was expecting a bit of oak or something but it was just so smooth. It may have just combined into something else where the sum if the parts no longer resembles the whole.
Taste as well us just completely mellow. So smooth, alcohol is nonexistent. Again, as with the taste it's difficult to identify individual components in the beer as they seem to have evolved into something unrecognizable to me, though thoroughly enjoyable.
Wow, just wow. Was able to do a side by side with some 2009. The 09 had a slight acetic sharpness to it, though behind that the beer was still very good. The 07 though is amazing.
**edit 26/12/11**
enjoyed a bottle of 2008 which has completely lived up to the high expectations i placed on it. as good as the 2007. wonderful stuff. 1,127 charactersjoecast, Apr 15, 2011
4.2/5  rDev -6.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4black with a small head that disappears rather quickly. smells boozy up front with the malt coming through in the end. slight hint of soy sauce but not a lot. chocolate as well. flavor is complex, bourbon is non-existent, which is a disappointment. hints of vanilla, chocolate and oak. Nice complexity. Warming sensation. The strong ABV is apparent, but not from a boozy taste. mouthfeel is thick and the beer coats the entire palette and kind of sticks around leaving an everpresent aftertaste. Overall a nice sipper. Not my favorite imperial stout, but a good beer either way. Just wish this actually had SOME hint of the bourbon I was expecting, based on the bottle's label. 677 charactersBlanco, Apr 11, 2011
4.52/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Ok so I managed to snag a few bottles of the 2010 release and held onto all of them until I just couldn't wait any longer. Tonights the night.
Poured into a snifter...
A - total ink black, the name suits the beer quite well. A medium pour yields a one finger sticky head. Tremendously thick lacing coats the glass and doesn't go anywhere.
S - bakers chocolate, anise, oak, roasted malts, vanilla and bourbon. Very complex, more smells find their way out of this beer with each sniff.
T - the first sip brings a nice balance of dark fruits, roasted malt, oak, and bourbon. The flavors combine very well and bring about a dry, hoppy finish. The slightest hint of espresso, I am pretty shocked to see all the reviews of smelling and tasting coffee...i could be having an off day but it's just not prevalent.
M - wonderfully silky smooth with a great amount of balance between everything that leaves the alcohol hidden very well. Hop twang and carbonation are perfect.
O - next time I will share this brew with many friends, as it is too much for one person. This is a very well crafted brew and much deserving of the hype, but it's not the best stout i've ever had. You should let this age more if you have the 2010, though. 1,227 charactersdfclav, Apr 10, 2011

4.59/5  rDev +2.5%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Reviewed from a tasting on 1/28/11. 
Appearance (4): A finger of thick, brown head. Mostly small but some larger foam bubbles that reduce to a thin layer with a thick ring. Little lacing. 
Aroma (4.5): Roasty with a bit of chocolate and pine. 
Taste (5): Dark chocolate and a burnt malt that leaves a lingering char. Chocolate is very prominent up front, and there is a slightly sweet middle with a mocha note. 
Mouthfeel (5): A very thick, chewy mouthfeel. Full bodied. 
Overall (4): Very good but a bit boozy. This one would definitely benefit from a few years in the cellar. Still an excellent RIS. 606 charactersgrover37, Apr 06, 2011
4.78/5  rDev +6.7%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5poured into a Darkness goblet.
Appearance:
By the time the foam hit the edge of the glass, it was sitting around a finger and a half, a chocolatey light brown color. The beer itself is jet black, even if I put it between me and a window. The foam gradually cuts itself down into a light covering with thick lace.
Smell:
Sweet and licorice-y, with the molasses coming in loud and clear too. the oak/bourbon is fairly subtle but present. I could imagine someone mistaking the licorice and molasses for chocolate.
Taste:
Sweet, like a liquid molasses cookie. licorice in the background, slightly masked by oak flavor. Hints of bourbon and chocolate, with just a touch of coffee. There is a very very light hop bitterness, just enough to balance with the sweetness.
Mouthfeel:
Syrupy and thick. Chewy certainly comes to mind. Low carbonation, and very full body. Coats the mouth and doesn't let go, forcing me to savor it forever.
Overall:
I think this may be my favorite sweet stout. It really is amazing. Everything about it screams deliciousness. Probably one of the best beers I've ever had.

4.41/5  rDev -1.6%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.52010 edition. Poured a super dark brown color. In the glass its black with no highlights let through. Vigorous carbonation when poured. You get the layered bubbles washing down the glass in sheets similar to a Guinness pour. Lacing is spotty and nice. Head is a masterpiece! Right now its an inch and a half high. Super frothy head that holds shape pretty well when you fuck with it with your finger. Pretty brown. 
Smells of super dark roasted malt with vanilla, oak, licorice, coffee and chocolate.
Cant taste the alcohol but its very warming to my throat. I was at first hit with coffee and roasted malt. A nice bitterness follows reminiscent of a dark bitter Belgian chocolate. Wood flavor is just how i like it, only a hint that adds to the overall complexity. Not overpowering like the oak in a 5 year cellared oak aged yeti. Awesome cream aftertaste. Super smooth mouthfeel. Nice carb.
The thing about this beer is how complex it is without any one flavor becoming overpowering. Bourbon is just hint but that is okay. All the flavors work amazing well together. Licorice is also lightly noticeable. 1,108 characterskbnooshay, Apr 05, 2011
4.61/5  rDev +2.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 52010 Reserve into a snifter. 
A - Pours a dark, used motor oil black, plenty viscous, with a creamy, tan, 2 finger head with a good amount of lacing. Not a ray of light penetrates this beer.
S - First smell is a bitter cocoa, like baker's chocolate chips, with hints of caramel, some dark fruit, and just a touch of bourbon.
T - Wow, lots of tastes going on here. Up front is a bit of dark fruit and that baker's chocolate. In the middle comes that oakyness from the barrels before fading into a delicious, roasted coffee taste. This is such a complex beer! It's like it actually changes the way it tastes as it goes through your mouth. Absolutely remarkable. 
M - The beer was full, but silky. Some of that bitterness lingered in the back of the throat, and I just now remembered that this beer is 11% ABV, because the alcohol is completely hidden. I love the way this beer permeates through the mouth and pretty much hits every taste bud.
Overall - Phenomenal. A great beer deserving of the hype. The most interesting thing about this beer is how much different is tastes from it's smell. I found the smell lacking to be honest, but when you take a drink of it, every single little flavor comes out. Remarkable beer. Glad I had the opportunity to try this. 1,263 charactersBeerBuckeye, Apr 03, 2011
4.16/5  rDev -7.1%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.52010, poured from a bomber into a snifter type glass.
Pours the deepest black I've ever seen- not a tinge of amber to be seen around the edges of this glass at all. Head lingers, minimal lacing. Despite that though, the aroma of charred malt is (surprisingly) not present. What I do get it the nose is a good deal of alcohol- not offputting, it just lets you know what you are getting in to. Fair amount of roast in the nose, as well as some nuttiness and dark chocolate. Did I mention it smells boozy?
Taste pretty much follows the smell. Lots of roasty character, coupled with nuttiness and chocolate. There is a lot to this beer, definitely not the beginner. The booze is strong with this one- which makes it a sipper for sure. Despite that, not overly syrupy.
This is, ultimately, a quality beer. A ton of flavor, this is what an Imperial Stout should be. My only regret is that I did not purchase more than three bottles, so I can age them. 948 charactersGhenna, Apr 02, 2011
4.95/5  rDev +10.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Appearance: pours a dark black color with a 1" head that lingers around a while. Spotty lace develops.
Smell: roasted malt, dark chocolates, licorice, vanilla, and a hint of bourbon create a wonderful aroma.
Taste: follows the nose as roasted malt base is big. Dark bitter chocolate, bourbon, vanilla, dark fruit sweetness is soft, licorice, and alcohol is strong and warming. Bitterness is quite strong for the style.
Mouthfeel: heavy in body. Lightly crisp to start, smooth and creamy at the finish. Aftertaste is very long as the flavors glue themselves to the tongue.
Overall: this beer creates an incredible experience as you can sit and slowly sip a glass of this beer over the course of an hour. Absolutely a great flavored beer - this was the 2010 version. 768 charactersGavage, Mar 31, 2011
3.6/5  rDev -19.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3 | feel: 4 |  overall: 42010 Abyss from a 22oz bomber bought at whole foods. 
Appearance- Poured like motor oil into my goblet, nice and thick looking. It had a nice mocha colored head to it with nice retention and a little bit of lacing.
Aroma- Lots of dark caramel malts, dark chocolate, dark fruits, anise, black licorice, and a nice hoppyness. Unfortunately for me the beer had a great aroma but fell through for me on the taste department.
Taste- Starts out with a myriad of beautiful caramel note, that morphed into a nice dark chocolate astringency, then moved into a very deep and bitter black licorice, and anise that seemed to overpower the back end way to much and turned me off a little bit.
Mouthfeel- The mouthfeel to this beer was a great silky texture that flowed over the palate, and the carbonation carried over enough to keep the beer moving. Mouthfeel was another nice touch to this beer.
Overall- A beautifully made beer, that I can tell was made with great care and talent. Perhaps not the imperial stout for me, but I enjoyed it for the greatness that it could achieve for me in the future. 1,094 charactersdookiepower, Mar 30, 2011

A - Absolutely pitch black, looks like motor oil, which is a good thing. One finger milk chocolate colored head that leaves good lacing. Great looking beer.
S - Chocolate, coffee, licorice, bourbon, vanilla, oak and alcohol. Very good stuff.
T - This is the most complex beer I've ever tasted. Coffee and vanilla and wood initially. Moves into some dark chocolate and bourbon. Finish is a good roasted barley flavor and also some vanilla is present again. This is excellent.
M - Mouthfeel is near perfect. Nice and creamy and thick with slight carbonation.
O - Overall, this is one of my favorite beers I've had the pleasure of tasting. So complex and alcohol is pretty well hidden. It's quite rich so it's good to have someone to split it with. Really enjoyed it, can't wait to see what some age does to it. 870 charactersJanderson91, Mar 27, 2011

Pours jet black with tan head that quickly fades but leaves a little lacing.
Smell is on the sweeter side with brown sugar, slight dark fruits, and just a hint of oak, and alcohol.
The taste is of dark fruits, burnt chocolate, a little oak. On the back you pick up just a tad of alcohol and an overall taste of almost a chocolate covered marshmellow...mmmm :)
The mouthfeel is pretty insane and very thick as it warms up.
An amazing beer but definitely a treat and not a regular drink. 503 charactersEriktheipaman, Mar 25, 2011

I'm listening to Animal Collective's Strawberry Jam and Tom Waits' Real Gone while drinking it and it's a totally radical experience.
The legendary 2009 Vintage
22 oz wax dipped bomber aged in my cabinet. I couldn't believe that it had been more than a year since I bought these two bottles. Poured into a Bruery tulip.
Appearance: Pours completely pitch black with a big frothy cocoa colored head. I was amazed the carbonation was so perfect and vigorous even after a year. Impressive lacing for an 11% ABV, that wax dipped seal totally did the trick. This is the darkest, most opaque beer I've ever seen in my life--I'm holding it up to a halogen desk lamp and not one shred of light is coming through. The abyss is the perfect name for this beer, I feel like I bought a bottle of water from the river Styx.
Smell: Like a Tom Waits song - boozy, dark, complex, and completely badass. Notes of bourbon, molasses, cocoa, licorice root, and sweet pipe tobacco. Dayum.
Taste: The taste is blowing my mind: dark chocolate, oaky bourbon, molasses, coffee, dates, a faint tartness like rum soaked cherries. I cant even detect the alcohol. A lot of times I have problems with imperial stouts tasting a little like soy sauce or beef jerkey. This beer does not have that problem. In fact it has no problems.
Mouthfeel: Super silky and creamy. Not cloyingly sweet or syrupy, due to the perfect carbonation. 
Overall: I haven't had too many rare beers and beers on the top 20 but for now this is probably the best beer I've ever tasted. 1,652 characterscoldwarkid, Mar 24, 2011

2010 vintage
A: I see why it's named the abyss. A beautiful pitch black, with no light penetrating this brew. A small cocoa colored one inch head. 
S: Slight hint of bourbon, chocolate, coffee, and molasses.
T: This beer is truly a picture of balance. Burnt malt hits first, mixed with a slight hint of bourbon. Next, sweet, dark chocolate flows over the middle of the palate, while blending in with pleasant licorice notes. The bourbon backs off of the middle of the tongue and is replaced by the vanilla sweetness of French oak barrels. Lastly, bourbon really heats up to blend perfectly with all this beer has to offer.
M: For those that have had Yeti and Bourbon County Stout, this feels almost between the two. It is super smooth, yet not as heavy as BCS.
O: A myriad of flavor, artfully crafted to superbly balance the chaos that could erupt with so much going on. Very, very, well done and deserving of a top ten spot, based on my limited experiences.
2016 vintage: similar to the 2010, but not as robust or frankly, as good. 11.1% abv. This version was hoppier, too hoppy, sadly, as it diminished the flavors in the base beer. Still good, though not nearly on the level of the 2010 vintage I had. I won't be buying anymore of this vintage. 1,391 charactersjohnnybgood1999, Mar 20, 2011

Initial taste is sweet, dark chocolate going into more molasses and licorice. A little bit of oak and bourbon as well. Finish has a decent bitterness and a decent amount of alcohol. Medium body.

Infamous 2009 batch.
Uninfected.
A - Dark and foamy, pours with a thick head that looks similar to chocolate mousse going into the glass.
S - Roast and bourbon right up front, a little bit of dark fruit on the back. 
T - Roasty bordering on smoky; slightly chalky and very woody. Bourbon galore, but not as overpowering as some. Some dates/raisins in there too. Little bit of soy sauce.
M - Smooth and creamy. Fairly dry and not at all cloying like some giant stouts can be.
D - I hope Deschutes distributes to Ohio soon... I want more of this. On KBS release day I feel this stout is superior. 649 charactersLiquidCucumber, Mar 15, 2011
4.5/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.52009 bottle of The Abyss. Picked up via a great trade.
Appearance - Poured a chocolate/almost midnight black color. A rich tan head formed as I poured. A nice meringue moonscape formed as the head receded. Little to see to comment on the carbonation as no light can penetrate. Lacing forms as the head resolves to a notable ring. 
Smell - Sweet aroma, mixed with some espresso and dark chocolate notes. Some roasty qualities come through as well, as it warms a bit more. (I only had this in the fridge for about four hours total, so I think this is the prime tasting zone for it). 
Taste - Chocolate, licorice some slight bourbon dryness as well greets your tongue as you pass it over your lips. So much to take in. Break it down. A coffee sweet entrance gives ground to a strong malty middle. The finish is hoppy, with the 11% ABV making its appearance as you close out this grateful sip.
Mouthfeel - What a creamy mouthfeel on this one. Lush, dense, crisp on your tongue as the hops clears way for the next sip. 
Drinkability - wow. So inviting, so dense, so drinkable. All of the great qualities of a creamy stout with the depth of an aged offering. I didn't get the sense at all of a brett contamination that I've heard about (and may have experienced at a past tasting). This was well done. My personal preference would be to let your 2009s sit for another year or two to allow the hops to further round out this offering. An excellent sipper right now, sure to improve with more age. Excellent. 1,505 charactersNesued, Mar 14, 2011
4.89/5  rDev +9.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 522oz bottle into Duvel tulip. 2010 vintage. Thanks to codewarrior for trading me this bottle.
Appearance: Free pour yields a frothy, one and a half inch head that dissipates steadily leaving a big ring of lacing. Pours black with red brown highlights. Leaves occasional large sweeps of lacing that travel slowly back down into the liquid on the beer's giant legs. 
Smell: From the bottle: chocolate and coffee. From the glass: Chocolate cake, molasses, some surprisingly fresh and potent (and welcome) hops, a mild but already growing fig/date/ambiguous dark fruit note, some coffee beans. 
There's a lot going on (and all of it good) at the start, but with time it just keeps getting better. This might be the best smelling beer I've ever experienced... the smell keeps developing, with vanilla sweetness coming up, then nuttiness, dark, bold coffee and chocolate notes, more lush, earthy hop aromas mixing with dark fruit, etc. 
Smelling this beer is like holding an auction, where the bidder had you won over long ago but he just keeps throwing in more money for no reason. This beer is out of control; the complexity is endless, but every note is heavenly. 
Taste: The first sip is coffee ice cream, some chocolate, and roasted malt. Moderate bitterness throughout. Great mix of coffee, chocolate, and roasted bitterness in the middle (with a hint of oak), leading to a coffee-with-cream sweetness in the finish. Chest warmth is the only indication of the 11% ABV here--there's no booziness whatsoever. 
The flavor was good, perhaps even "exemplary of an imperial stout" at first, and I was ready to drop a 4.0 or 4.5 to praise this beer, like Founder's Breakfast Stout, for perfecting conventional flavors even though it hadn't blown my mind. Then, as with the smell, the flavor really opened up, and ventured deep into 5.0 territory. All kinds of new flavors prominently emerge; the various dark fruit notes from the smell, licorice, tobacco, vanilla, all carried along by that perfect amount of hop-and-roast bitterness (bottle says 65 IBUs, which is indicative of how it actually tastes). It's deep, refined, and insistently delicious.
Like many of the great beers of the world, The Abyss continues to generously reveal more beautiful nuances throughout the bottle. This beer is a masterpiece, and deserves every bit of praise that it gets.
Mouthfeel: Full bodied, very creamy, just enough carbonation. The bitterness aids the flavor by (among other things) keeping it from getting too rich, and it aids the feel by keeping things nice and lively. 
Drinkability: With the effusive praise in the "Smell" and "Taste" sections, I think you can guess that I am not having any trouble consuming this beer, and would happily buy more.
---
I occasionally talk about my time "visiting the abyss" when I mention my self-destructive college/grad school antics, or general hatred. While I can see that one would want to drink enough of this (very strong) beer to go to the abyss, I would say that this Abyss is a much friendlier place. Sort of reminds me of the Kids in the Hall Simon Milligan sketches, in that The Abyss is less hellfire and more "here, let me shower you with gifts far beyond your expectations, and here's even more to boot." 3,252 charactersPahn, Mar 13, 2011

pours black as night with a dark mocha head that forms a darker layer underneath. it takes a few minutes to recede, but leaves tons of lacing on the glass.

cacao powder, licorice, black strap molasses, good amount of piney hops, some wood, bourbon, good amount of alcohol heat.
very thick, with subtle carbonation that suits the flavor profile perfectly. plenty syrupy and sticky with a drying cocoa powder finish, but some sweetness lingering for a bit.
drinks well. very smooth and full-flavored with a nice alcohol kick, but no harshness. worth the hype? maybe. Wish I could have picked up a couple more of these for the basement. 857 characterssilentjay, Mar 12, 2011

Pours an absolutely pitch black with a small 1 inch tan head that fades to a small film on the top of the beer. Spotty ring lacing around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, bittersweet chocolate, molasses, vanilla, licorice, and cinnamon. Absolutely delicious smelling. Tastes of dark roasted malt, bitter coffee, cocoa powder, and vanilla extract. Subtle hints of licorice and cinnamon on the finish. Very thick and creamy in the mouth. Drinkability is out of this world. A great beer to sit and sip on for a prolonged period of time. The ABV is well hidden in the taste but it sneaks up on you in the end. This is really a beer that you can only have one of at a time. Overall, a truly exceptional beer. I am glad I have a stockpile of these in my cellar. 797 charactersUCLABrewN84, Mar 11, 2011

Vintage: 2010 Reserve
The inside of the cap says "Bravely Done".
A - Pours a near ink blot dark brown with a nice tan head that was about .5 inches and receded fairly quickly. It didn't seem as viscous as other Stouts of this caliber. The head has some nice tight bubbles that stick around after a nice swirl. 
S - Aroma is delicious in this beer. Molasses, sweet caramel, nice raisin notes with some slight bready and oat notes. Good grain backbone on a strong beer. Slight roasted espresso notes as well as some mild dark chocolate and some sweet milk chocolate. There is some great woody and oak notes on the finish as well. Some boozy sweetness is also perceived. The licorice is slightly perceived but it doesn't dominate at all. 
T & M - Not as viscous as expected. Starts off with some roasted coffee notes and some nice molasses sweetness. The licorice can be perceived a bit more on the palette. Good dark fruit sweetness as well. There is some nice bourbon notes and alcohol burn that balances out some of the roasted notes. There is very slight chocolate notes that seem to be downplayed by the boozy aspect. It is quite light for a double Stout and I attribute that to the barrel aging. There are some slight woody dry notes on the back end as well. Pretty well balanced stout with a good mix of roast, bourbon notes and molasses sweetness. The body is nice and full with great complexity. Solid offering and I can see why its so hyped.
D - It is delicious but it could be hard to drink more than one based on flavor intensity and ABV. Still great offer. 1,624 charactersJoEBoBpr, Mar 10, 2011

Poured out of a bottle. 
Served in a goblet
A- Dark, thick, tan head, tan lacing.
S-To make the best comparison, it smells like a hotter version of Founder's Breakfast Stout with some licorice hints. You've got some malt, some coffee/espresso, and your licorice.
M- Light mouthfeel for a dark beer, not surprising at this point.
T- What deflated the hype for me and my tasting group is we had just drank Founder's Breakfast Stout. Keep in mind we took a break, cleansed the palate, came back and this happened. It tastes like a hotter version of Founder's Breakfast Stout with some licorice and bourbon hints in it. I was expecting something mind blowing and different from Breakfast Stout and it didn't deliver. Which isn't fair, it's a good beer.
Food- Again, no food, it stands on its own.

A pitch black pour with a thin brown head. Gorgeous beer. Leaves lines of lacing down the glass. A thick and decadent looking stout. 
A spectacular nose that centers around chocolate. Some roast coffee, some wood, but predominately chocolate. No alcohol in the nose. Wow!
A chocolate bomb! Some roasted coffee, molasses, a bit of tartness, a touch of warmth from the alcohol, but I come back to chocolate, chocolate, chocolate. Surprising and spectacular!
Rich and luscious mouthfeel. Superb.
A spectacular, easy drinking, well-balanced, nearly perfect stout. So delicious! 653 charactersehammond1, Mar 08, 2011

S - lots to sift through in both the scent and the taste. Roast malt, oak, smoke, sweet, hop, earthy, coffee, chocolate.
T - the most appropriately named beer out there. 20 different flavors come through. Smoke, oak, bourbon, wood; chocolate, coffee, toffee, dark fruit, sweet molasses. There's so much to this beer that every sip is different. 
M & D - fantastic balance of all of the above. Alcohol is not a prominent taste but you can feel that it's there. Awesome beer in every way. 658 characterstbern007, Mar 07, 2011

S: Tons of oak aroma are backed by the sweetness of molasses.
T: Sweet and oaky molasses come in first. its shortly followed by hints of licorice and malt complexity. the alcohol is very detectable.
M: Medium to thin mouthfeel. This beer is almost syrup like in the way it coats your mouth.
D: Very drinkable. Smooth and delicious.
The Abyss is a great Imperial Stout. It is a fantastic winter beer and a dream for beer geeks everywhere. 574 charactersNikkibrews13, Mar 07, 2011

Poured dark black no light getting through here.
A=smells sweet, with big roast aroma, and a nice oak smell that is nit overdone. Maybe some vanilla as well.
T=is incredibly smooth first of all. This beer isn't ready for 8 more months!?!? Surely you jest!! First it's sweet, followed by a touch if oak and a hint if bourbon - I'm pleasantly surprised that neither is overdone, especially at this young age. I'm also picking up some coffee and chocolate, with vanilla also. I feel the warming from the alcohol, but I never would have guessed it was 11% abv. 
M= is a perfect medium to full, that is sticky and wonderful.
Overall this beer is bomb dot com. I wish I had bought more than 3 bottles now. Oh well, there is always next year! 754 characterswebbcreative, Mar 07, 2011

4.72/5  rDev +5.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4This is the 2010 vintage. Poured from the bomber into a Trappist chalice.
A: True to its name - absolutely black with not a speck of light shining through. Head is almost nonexistent - half a finger of brown foam that dissipates in under a minute. 
S: This is one of those beers you can smell from several feet away, and actually you can make out several different notes from a distance. Your olfactory glands explode when the beer is brought up close. Roasted malt and black coffee at first, then a bit of vanilla and a hint of anise and brown sugar. Mocha and progressively sweeter chocolate notes come into play, and there is a creamy flash there at the end before a woody and roasted character takes over everything again.
T: So so rich, at first bitter chocolate and some woody character with a bit of anise. Char and some smoke. Then milk chocolate and a hint of cream. Spices. Tobacco. Finishes bittersweet with a mocha character. W bit of a whisky finish in there as well. Very strong - dominates the palate and floods the senses. Excellent.
M: Super smooth and masks alcohol extremely well. Slight dryness toward the end, but leaves you wanting more.
D: Rich rich rich. Got through the bottle but need a big break afterwards. A slow sipper for sure, but I could see myself coming back to this again and again.
I want to see this with a bit of age on it. A top stout even without age. Excellent beer. 1,414 charactersBucBasil, Mar 06, 2011

2010 Abyss, consumed 3/5/11
Last bottle from Phelps and its looking like a good one.
Dug through the black wax that covers the top of this one and poured into a tulip glass. Appearance is pitch black with a good amount of tan foam that just seems to be hanging around as I type this. As I swirl it in my glass it leaves a nice oily lacing that falls down the side. Aroma is some nice chocolate, a bit of wood and brown sugar sweetness. Really nice taste, sweet chocolate and rich roasted malts, there is some vanilla in there as well as a bit of oakiness. Thick oily mouthfeel with light carbonation, this is very drinkable and quite tasty. I'm really curious to see what it is. I'm really bad at guessing beers and since this focuses more on local stuff, I probably didn't have it. so, lets see...
2010 Abyss
I was thinking this might be what it was, but for some reason I thought the bottle was a different shape. wow, this is tasting really good. For some reason I remember other years being hotter but this is really smooth and quite enjoyable. Big thanks for sending this one my way. Off to finish the bottle.

Pours as dark as ink with a one finger dark brown head that looks like chocolate milk. 
Smells first of toasty oak, mellow bourbon, dark chocolate, dark fruits, toasted bread, a little alcohol and roasted malts. 
The taste is really strong on the molasses at the beginning, bringing in a nice thick thread of caramel and almost candy bar like mixture of chocolate, nuts and caramel. This only lasts a few seconds when the bourbon kicks down the door and ups the ante with a really potent woody booze. There are nice levels of chocolate, cocoa powder, prunes, chocolate covered raisins, and a nice alcohol finish. As it warms it opens up with a nice coffee roastiness, hot fudge, hazelnut and some sugary sweetness. 
The mouthfeel is very velvety and thick with a pleasantly roasty finish that tickles the back of your tongue. 
Overall this isn't the most revolutionary RIS I've had but it has to have one of the deepest flavor profiles and one of the most balanced stouts that is aged in bourbon. The bourbon is folded right into the mix and is perfect with the molasses, cocoa powder and toasty malts. 1,120 charactersblammasterj, Mar 05, 2011

Pours a thick, dark black which seems like engine oil. Very minimal brown head. Scent is chocolatey with some espresso and a hint of wood. Taste is FANTASTIC! First I get sweet chocolate and subtle bourbon flavors. Then I get some oak flavors with vanilla and a tiny bit of black licorice. Not nearly as much coffee/espresso as I was expecting, which isn't a bad thing considering the amazing flavors and complexity to this beer. There is a little bit of hop bitterness throughout. Mouthfeel is thick and rich...close to perfect. Drinkability is high as ABV is SCARY WELL HIDDEN! Awesome beer! 694 charactersDovaliHops, Mar 05, 2011

Brewer: Deschutes Brewery
Company: Bend, Oregon
Style: American Double / Imperial Stout
ABV: 11.00%
Beer Advocate: Jay Avery
Rating: A
Recommend by my buddy @Craig Reyna, I was a bit apprehensive about trying this one because I'm a QUAD guy and not a fan of stouts. The nitro infused carbonation really puts me off and if I were to have a stout, I already have my go-to, North Coast's Old Rasputin. I do, however; have a Deschutes favorite and that's the Black Butte Porter.I've also been to Bend, Oregon twice in the last two years and now I'm kicking myself in the ass for not going to the Deschutes Brewery! Anyway, after I got this recommend from Craig I started doing some research and this happens to be a once a year brew, a seasonal winter brew as they call it in the beer world. I called all over the place and of course the response was ' ya, that came and went. ' Anyway, on my 7th call, the liquor store owner admitted that he'd set a an entire case aside for his own consumption and after a ton of haggling I convinced him to sell me 4 bottles. This stuff must have ADONIS D.N.A in it since he charged me $16 bucks a bottle, ***WINNING!*** Here is my review... 
Presentation:
A 22 oz wax-dipped bomber that was meant for aging so instead of a freshness date, it's labeled; rather, with a "Best After" date of 11/15/2011. I guess it's a little early to be drinking this stuff but considering the amount of work it took to get my hands on this bottle, I'm not waiting until November to crack it open. So after about 10 minutes of cutting, peeling and cracking the wax dipped cover off, I'm finally able to break the seal and finally pour this highly anticipated brew into an oversized wine glass. It poured like the exxon valdez with a double espresso hazelnut head and generous but thin lacing. Underneath the cap read the words, "Bravely done". Now if that isn't a rock star quote from Mars I don't know what is...
Appearance:
It pours like an Elixir or more accurately, like a 10w 30 motor-oil. I'm not talking synthetic but I'm talking about a serious bonafide thick and viscous friction free engine saver. Thicker than oyster sauce and an oily pitch black. I mean you can shine a high power surefire flashlight directly in front of this stuff and you're not getting a spec of light through it. 
Smell:
An insane full roast coffee, smoky and woody with hints of chocolate dipped graham cracker. Only fools and trolls wouldn't want to take a sip of this amazing and aromatic cloud of chocolaty heaven!
Mouthfeel:
Velvety and THICK. Did I say THICK? What does that even mean?! I compare it to drinking a liquefied semi-sweet neslte chocolate chip infused red velvet cake without the frosting. Oh she's thick! If you're in the mood for a light beer then you need to turn around, take your ball and GO HOME! This is one of the heartiest beers I've ever had the pleasure of drinking, a pint of this and you're FULL, literally. ** WINNING! **
Drinkability:
The true definition of a sipper. This one must be laced with the infamous Tiger's Blood. It stands out to me as a special occasion type beer, something you'd want to share with another like-minded beer lover who can appreciate it's uniqueness. It's funny though cause it has an easier drinkability than my usual go-to stout, Mister OLD RASPUTIN, which was a welcome surprise. It's like a WIN inside of every moment!
Taste:
Better than the smell, you almost can't process it with the normal brain...boy am I impressed! It starts off Oaky and woody since it was 33% aged in French oak and bourbon barrels. That being said, it's only a 3rd aged in those barrels so the oak wasn't too corky and there was a touch of bourbon that shined through just enough to tell you that it was different from the rest. I also get a dark truffle baker's chocolate roasted malt finish. It's like walking into a Starbucks and ordering off of their secret menu and sipping a chocolate full roast coffee blend with a nutty alcoholic backbone and a cocoa finish. You're sitting in the coffee shop sipping on a secret brew and only you know about it and only you can appreciate its bitter black licorice personality as it envelopes itself into an almost Charlie sheen like rebelliousness!! I really can't fathom how awesome this brew is going to be after I finish aging it. I don't expect you to either. I opened this one up prematurely because I'm impatient and need immediate gratification but I am already truly amazed by the absolute posterboy for a warlock stout that presented itself here... I can't wait to grab the next one out of my cellar in 8-10 months when this beer hits its sweet spot! I just took my final sip while finishing up this 22 oz bomber by myself and look at me, I'm drunk.., DUH! Cause that's how I roll, I only have one speed, I have one gear.. " GO !!

An aggressive pour generates 3 fingers of head that dissipates moderately fast. Little lacing but a small ring stays with this beer.
The smell is terrific, the best part of this beer for me. No sign of infection. Walnuts, vanilla, cooked sugar, not much bourbon influence.
Mouthfeel is lighter than I expected, this Abyss has a great nose and flavor, but seems lighter than the 2010.
Flavor is very good, but not as much bourbon as I had hoped. I get very little licorice, but the molasses is prevalent.
All in all a great dessert. One more 2009 in the cellar and I hope it performs as well. 643 characterswchollif, Mar 05, 2011

This was one of the beers that got me into trading and boy did the 2009 disappoint. I decided to refrain from reviewing until I was able to crack a bottle of this beer in its intended form and I'm glad I did.
Beer poured into my Deschutes snifter, because I can (...looking at you drabmuh). Thick black pour with a couple fingers of a frothy tan head.
Chocolate, roasted malt, oak and a hint of bourbon hit the nose and palate with a rich and thick feel. This is an incredible beer and if I could change anything it would adding a bit more of a bourbon presence but that is really nitpicking. 663 charactersLunch, Mar 04, 2011
4.63/5  rDev +3.3%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4This beer is jet black with a thin cap of dark brown foam on top which leaves some of the best lacing I've ever seen. When it was first served to me it was a bit too cold, and the smell was a bit subdued - it actually smelled a lot like Oskar Blues Ten Fidy. Once it warmed up, however, there was an obscene amount of roast character with some oak in the background with some dark chocolate and coffee. 
The flavor is a neck and neck battle between sweet and bitter. The bitterness is both in part from hops as well as from the ridiculous amount of roasted grains and the sweetness is just from the residual sugars left from fermentation - I don't get any caramel character. There is an oaky astringency that plays well with the tannins from the roasted malts and the finish tastes entirely of dark cocoa powder. A beer that is simply a tribute to the glory of dark malts...amazing. 883 characterscyraxx, Mar 04, 2011
4.7/5  rDev +4.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to duff247. 2010 vintage. 22oz bottle poured into a snifter.
Pours as black as night with a small, foamy dark brown head. Head reduces to a thin light brown ring around the glass. Foamy wisps of lacing are left on the glass.
Very strong and complex aroma. Dark chocolate leads the way along with some wood. Definitely some oak and vanilla present. Black licorice shows up big time on the back end. Dark, roasted malts are here as well and blend nicely with the other scents. There is some bourbon and, while it seems to come on most just before the black licorice at the end, it can be picked up almost immediately and rides underneath the rest of the aromas.
The taste is just as complex as the nose. Really the only difference from the nose is that a huge dose of anise and a bit of molasses are thrown in the mix. Starts off slightly chocolaty with a decent wood presence before being completely taking over by a combination of black licorice and anise. Some molasses and roasted malt are present as well. The finish is bourbon and a good amount of oak, leaving a nice warmth to the back of the throat. The flavors blend together nicely but the black licorice and anise are what really stand out. 
Surprisingly, the beer has a medium mouthfeel overall. A medium body with lighter carbonation allow it to be smooth, rich and creamy without being as heavy as it seems it would be. Pretty amazing that a beer of this size and complexity doesn't have to be dense and heavy.
Drinkability is excellent with this beer. Normally an 11% ABV bomber is a beer to split but it was halfway gone before I had let the full flavor profile run around and allow me to grasp it. The other half was just enjoyed slowly. Definitely a sipper that is probably best enjoyed on a cold winter night. 1,788 charactersms11781, Mar 03, 2011
5/5  rDev +11.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 52008 bottle poured into a Tulip. 
Served at Cellar temp (around 53-55 degrees). 
A: Pours a pitch black body (no light getting through this sucker.) Dark brown hues appear on the edges - looks like creamy milk chocolate. Came with a dark mocha head, about 2 fingers worth. Left an artwork amount lacing down the glass to the very last drop. 
S: Wonderful blend of anise, mocha, dark chocolate (lots of dark chocolate), Vanilla and a vary vague amount of bourbon (but still there.) Also some trace amounts of oak and molasses. Roasted grains and malts present as well. A extremely good smelling beer that sucks you in. I would argue that you could not just smell this beer. One whif and you would be begging to taste it. 
T: Improves upon the smell going from very seductive to down right criminaly awesome. The big components of the beer play in harmony giving your palate one heck of a showing. Licorice and dark chocolate dominate up front and linger onto the finish. The finish has a strong sense of mocha, molasses and faint bourbon. Vanila pretty faint in this beer, but still present. Has a nice roasted malt base that makes this beer a very hard one to put down. 
M: Not as thick as you would expect from the pour. Medium bodied beer that coats the palate nicely. The carbonation is surpisngly very good in this beer (being a 2008 vintage). Alcohol is so well hidden, upon first sip, it drinks like a chocolatey milk shake. 
D: The highest drinkablity score i can possibly give to this beer: Perfect. The beer is damn right perfect from inside out. Sometimes big russian imperial stouts can be to thick and hard to take all the way down. The Abyss, with its medium mouthfeel goes down smoothly; drinking this bottle down to the end goes by faster then you would think and hope. 
Homerism aside, The Abyss is straight up a world class beer. It is widely available up and down the west coast. No stupid brewery only release in an attempt to make their beer more important then it really is. It is also quite amazing Deschutes can produce such a good beer with such a large scale production (350bbl on the 2008, up to 600bbl on the most recent batches). Fantastic beer from a fantastic brewery. My hats off to you Deschutes. 2,234 charactersCaptainTripps, Mar 02, 2011

Appearance- Pitch black with a dark brown head. Great lacing. 
Smell- Dark chocolate and alcohol are the biggest things in the aroma. Vanilla, some hops and anise are also present in a smaller amount. 
Taste- Dark chocolate, vanilla, anise and alcohol. In that order. It also tastes like a chocolate and brandy milk shake. 
Mouthfeel- Thick, chewy, and surprisingly creamy at the same time. Very good. 
Drinkability- This is a great beer to have on a blustery night (as this is). Even though it is 11% I am already thinking of another. But I won't because I want to save the others I have for these type of nights. 
Because I opened this I will have to get another. Excellent beer! Thanks Deschutes!! 743 charactersMADhombrewer, Mar 02, 2011
4.38/5  rDev -2.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 42009 Reserve found at Whole Foods in Phoenix (Paradise Valley). Jet black with a dense tan head, good retention, and fair amount of lace. Aroma has elements of chocolate, molasses, and a hint of smoke. A bit hard on the carbonation up front. Plenty of residual sugar and the alcohol is definitely there, but lots of other interesting stuff going on. The molasses is certainly noticeable in the acidity and slight smokiness. Good amount of bitterness to balance out the sweetness. Licorice in the middle with oak and a bit of acidity. Bittersweet back end with a bit of tang.
I was pretty surprised to find this, as it was there and gone in my home town (Austin). 663 charactersLittleDon, Mar 02, 2011

This is one brown-eyed girl, with a dark, almost chocolaty, head. A sweet smelling beer, with just a little hint of spice and chocolate.
My first impression is a woody taste with a hint of smoke. The body of the flavor is anise, licorice, and molasses. There is a hint of alcohol burn as you start to take in the slight bourbon and oak flavors.
This is fairly light and carbonated for an Imperial Stout, and a bit high on the burn factor. I downgraded both the mouthfeel and the drinkability for this lightness and slight burn. Overall a very good beer that I am anxious to try again as it ages. 632 characterstmcelvain, Mar 01, 2011

After I managed to get the wax seal off of the bottle, I popped the top- instantly had a tart molasses bubble rise to the top of the bottle. It popped, giving me a tart scent of dark molasses. Poured into my Dfh snifter, pours a pitch black color, with a little tan head. Smell- lightly sour and tart molasses, licqourice, and chocolate. Taste- coffee, liquorice, and molasses, with a dark chocolate finish. This is an amazing beer experience. Lives up to the hype. 583 characterslnashsig, Mar 01, 2011

A: Opaque, black pour with a one finger tan head. Head really goes away fast, but laces a bit.
S: Black licorice, bourbon, chocolate, roasted malts, and I'm sure something else. A lot going on here. Interested to move to the taste.
T: Decent amount of black licorice, didn't know what it was at first, chocolate coming through as well. Ending is mostly coffee. Bourbon taste comes throughout, and sticks on the palate a bit. Dry finish.
MF: Heavy, but not the heaviest I've had. Nice and creamy.
D: The black licorice becomes a bit much, but the bourbon isn't overpowering.
2011 Vintage. Enjoyed on 12/26/12. After the "best after" date of 8/4/12. This review will be represented in the official score, as it's when the brewer intended it to be drank.
A: The beer pours out motor oil black with a big mocha head. The head is as creamy as it gets, lasts forever, and laces beautifully on its way down. Pretty much the definition of a good stout. 4.5
S: The aroma is of black licorice, as the previous vintage I had was, but this is nicely blended with chocolate, roast, bourbon and oak. The molasses is apparent, but not really cherry or vanilla. The oak and booze combine forces to combat the licorice, and they're actually doing a good job. The chocolate and roast are nice and robust. I'm looking forward to the taste. 4.5
T: The licorice is only a small part of the taste thankfully. The chocolate and molasses provide a base for what is to come. Which includes a nice blend of booze, bourbon, and more subtle dark fruit notes of red wine. The barrels really punch you in the face with seemingly new flavors every time. I just wish bourbon played more of a role, as this vintage seems to be more focused on oak (which I don't like as much personally). I have to say that this is better after the "best after" date, go figure. 4.5
MF: The body is nice and thick, right at syrupy, with a lower than average amount of carbonation. The roast and oak just stick around on the palate forever and make you want to drink some more. The ABV will creep up on you if you don't watch it. 4.5
O: This really blew me away compared to what I thought of it last time. The barrels really come together in a good way and build off of a big, sweet base. Now I understand why it's so highly regarded and I'll be sure to wait until after the "best after" date from now on. 4 2,451 charactersrusswbeck, Feb 28, 2011

I came in hesitant. Knowing that once upon a time a 2009 abyss was about an inch away from being winced at. 
The smell was overwelmingly chocolatey and believe it or not had no trace of bottle contaminatgion or sour infestation. I'm excited. 
The look is fantastic dark and thick with tan head. A quick swirl gives slightly watery lacing.
The taste is a swirling blend of dark chocolate slow roastyness and a hint of burnt. The bourban comes through a tlittle which is ine for me. 
I had the black butte 22 earlier and this years abyss is definitley smoother by far.

2010 vintage.
A - An aptly named beer, this beer certainly does its best impression of an abyss, although it does yield to some bark colored highlights around the edges. A creamy, 1.5-fingered head, light tan in appearance sits gently on top. Retention is moderate, but when its gone it leaves very thick bubbles behind. Lacing is generous and thin, and overall very nice.
S - The aroma on this beer is a nice hybrid between the base beer, barrel, and black licorice. It's sweet malts bring a nice chocolately smell, while the barrel adds some nice oak and vanilla notes. The most interesting smell in this beer is the strong black licorice presence. It dominates the back end of the smell and is certainly unique, despite me not having a huge affinity towards licorice to begin with.
T - The taste just absolutely takes the smell to a new level. The mats here are so bold that it almost brings a smoky quality, perhaps some espresso roast, which lingers far into the finish. Afterwards the chocolates come through, but are more subtle caught between the mats and black licorice. Speaking of, the licorice steals the stage of the mid-taste onwards. Perhaps a slight hop bitterness arises, but the licorice dominates the end of the taste. Alcohol is extremely well hidden, I would never assume this was 11%.
M - The mouthfeel is much lighter than I would've expected from a beer of the gravity. It's medium to medium-light with moderately low carbonation, and leaves a nice coating on the palate. 
D - Drinkability is high. The flavors are bold, rich, and unique, and the alcohol is dangerously hidden. This beer is definitely worth the praise, and I wish I had easier access to this! 1,826 charactersnhindian, Feb 28, 2011
4.5/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A: Poured a rich black color, not sure how, but it was rich black. A good amount of sudsy head developed and stuck around while drinking.
S: Lots of molasses and wood. I get a nice smokiness too. There is the slightest spice coming through, maybe the licorice?
T: Dark roasted malt, molasses, dark roasted malt, smokiness and dark roasted malt. There is a woodiness to the background that has hints of caramel but very subtle. I even get a bit of grassy or herbal hop notes in the mid swig. Somewhere near the end is the slightest bit of burnt coffee. This is not a sweet beer and not a smoke beer. It is a dark roasty angel sent from beer heaven. 
M: Velvety with the right amount of carbonation and a little syrupy.
D: This is an Imperial that can be sipped for hours. Very smooth.
This is an incredible Imperial Stout, nearly a perfect one for me. Dark, roasty, smooth and with interesting balance of flavors. The score says it all. 940 characterslegalpete19340, Feb 28, 2011
4.43/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5A - Poured a solid dark black out of the bottle into the glass. Thick milk chocolate colored head grew as the beer sat for a minute, this is one nice looking beer. This beer sticks to the side of the glass with a light film, it lets you know you're about to drink something serious. 
S - I got plenty of coffee and roasted malts immediately. There is an interesting background of wood smoke, and definitely earthy woodiness to it as well. Some licorice, and small amount of vanilla as well. It's solid for sure, but nothing jumps out as too prevalant. 
T - There's so much going on here, it's hard to identify. First prevalent taste was a subtle coffee tone that switched to some nice roasted malts. Not over the top on bitterness which is great for me. Plenty of the bourbon tones, and midrange of vanilla flavor. Not as sweet as other big barrel aged RIS, but that's not a bad thing. Some sips bring in chocolate covered cherries. Nice surprise was earthy hops at the finish, nice to have that balance in this style. Final point on the agenda was a definite warm alcohol burn as it goes down the hatch, this is like a nice brandy. 
M - What is there to say, it's pure delicious motor oil, low carbonation, silky smooth. Right on point for a huge RIS. 
D - To be honest, I have a rough time calling any big RIS "highly drinkable" so I rate to the style. This mule of a beer is as good as any of this breed as far as balance and ability to enjoy, but I feel that one maybe two is max for anyone that isn't used to drinking Scotch served neat on a hot day. 1,559 characterschilly460, Feb 27, 2011
4.83/5  rDev +7.8%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5I was pretty apprehensive about opening my 2009 vintage of The Abyss. I would be pretty angry that I sat on this beer for close to a year and a half with the possibility of infection. Only one way to find out. Cold weather, and rain made this beer all the more welcoming.
Pours deepest inky black. Its like looking into a black pool of liquid chocolate. Abundance of foam created a soft 2 finger head of considerable retention, followed by sticky lacing that rims the glass, and settles on top of this dark elixir. Foam is a very dark mocha, perhaps one of the darkest I've come across thus far. 
Aroma abounds with big notes of bourbon, molasses, roast, slightly earthy, chocolate and black licorice goodness. Some light astringency, but I don't get any sour notes that would indicate a infection. That makes me feel loads better. The hops give it a nice earthy tone, as mentioned earlier, and plays very well with the black licorice and oak barrel aging. Come to think of it, this just might be my first barrel aged beer. 
All indicators point to this not being a infected bottle, and it sure didn't have infection. This is diabolical malt bomb of the highest echelon. Chocolate, and molasses are the first out the gate as they caress the taste buds. Mid palate is caramel, light toffee, some nice earthy roasted flavors with just a very slight hint of astringency, followed in short order by bourbon and black licorice. Ah yes, that black licorice. It lasts long after the sip. 
Mouthfeel is the cream of the crop. Think milkshake with a small side of carbonation. Nice, thick, and chewy. Almost have to have a spoon with this.
The aging in this beer has really toned down the alcohol burn to the point of none existent. I can see myself having a snifter of this anytime of year, rain or shine, it's that damn good. Not to mention that the barrel aging has really combined all the flavor's and nuances of this otherwise, incredibly made, and well crafted beer. Cheers! 1,976 charactersFoxtrot, Feb 27, 2011

Aroma of licorice, black berries, coffee, hops are gone, but you can tell they were definately there. What is left is a nice balance of fruitiness/herbalness from the berries and anise. Taste is rich coffee roastiness with herbal licorice notes, light barrel aging flavors - just a hint of booze on the finale, bitter finish. Palate is a bit flat, but full flavored and creamy. 444 charactersLuk13, Feb 26, 2011

2010 Vintage
Pours a color that's blacker than black with a nice brown head into my glass. Can't top this.
Bourbon, oak, dark fruit, coffee and licorice aromas stimulate the olfactory gland. I haven't met many stouts with such a variation in aromas.
A delicate balance of oak and bourbon greet the palate upfront, followed by bursts of licorice, coffee and cream. I can't describe just how good it tastes.
Mouthfeel is full of a mix of what I can only describe as Oaked Creamy Licorice infused with mocha and cocoa. Wow, that actually sounds good to me. I think I'll trademark it.
There's a reason why this is a favorite among BeerAdvocates: It's tickles your palate and blows your mind. 806 charactersBrad007, Feb 26, 2011
4.95/5  rDev +10.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Vintage 2009 Bottle. 
Served in a snifter glass.
Appearance: Thick viscous with an ample mocha colored head. The head on this beer is fluffy with tiny as well as large bubbles. 
Smell: The aroma in this beer is of coffee chocolate, hops, bourbon, and licorice. It also has a significant alcohol aroma. 
Taste: This beer has a medium body mouth-feel; it gives off a distinct warming alcohol feel in the throat and belly! Compared to other stouts this beer is dry. The taste like the smell is of faint chocolate, lots of coffee and licorice as well as a mild taste of bourbon. 
Final thoughts: With the ever-growing number of Imperial stouts available I think this is one that definitely stands out. I'm not saying it is the best out there but in a blind taste of Imperial stouts I am sure I can easily pick this one out. The combination of bourbon aging and licorice are what make this stout stand out. If you are not impressed by the first sip wait till the last third of the bottle and you will grow to appreciate this beer, if not you will at least get a good buzz!! 1,068 charactersChanChan, Feb 24, 2011

S: The smells coming off this one change every few seconds. I love it. Persimmon, dark chocolate, plum, coffee and a bit of a charcoal smell. Pretty much the everlasting gobstopper of smells. 
T: Full, smooth, complex and sweet. A lot of dark chocolate and coffee along with some dark fruit. Hides the alcohol well, but there's a nice warming sensation as you drink this. Without a doubt, the best beer I've ever had. 516 charactersnotchucknorris, Feb 23, 2011

A - Motor oil color and thickness. Used motor oil at that. Strong head formation, mocha/brown colored and quickly breaks down to a light film with little lacing.
S - Chocolate, molasses, and just a little bit of yeast graininess. Overall not an extremely strong smelling beer. The marmite of yeast starts to show as things go along.
T - Starts off with a strong chocolate malt note, toffee, and caramel. Just a little bit of vanilla. Mid-stream starts to show alot of hopping, some bitterness. Roasted and burnt barley starts to sneak through. Finishes with some vanilla and toffee notes.
M - Moderate beer body, strong think body. Very clingy. Carbonation is balanced, brings the beer into balance. Finishes with a sticky burnt taste note.
D - Moderate drinkability for a beer of such uber strength. ABV will sneak up on you. Slightly filling at times. Light amount of warmth. 
Is this the beer that sits at the top of the biggest stouts? Really good no doubt, but I'm going to have to lean towards Speedway as the upper hand. I'll age some and revisit. 1,093 characterskatan, Feb 23, 2011

S- Oak and Bourbon. Dark roasted malts as well. Slight cocoa.
T- Very very roasted. Only slightly burnt with a little cocoa. Slight molasses. Not overpowering, but very subtle, and in a way quite foundational to the flavor profile. I was amazed at how little of this I had to consume to take in all the vastness of the flavor.
M- Very smooth and creamy. Medium full body. 
D- Filling but easy to down. The ABV is hidden extremely well, but the think that takes the most away from the drinkability is how filling it is. It's literally a meal in a bottle. I hear that all the time, but this seems to fit that statement perfectly. 723 charactersBBP, Feb 23, 2011

This beer is infected. The nose and taste are dominated by an offputing lactic sourness. 
A very slight bitter roast note comes through. But any complexity, oak, or bourbon is gone. 
Sad. I wonder if its a victim of the growing problem I've been hearing about of brewery's wild brews contaminating their non-wild brews. 334 charactersTbone, Feb 23, 2011

A: Pours thick pitch black with a tan frothy head. Good lacing.
S: Toasty malts, dark fruits, molasses, chocolate, and some ethanol.
T: Lots going on here. Semi-sweet dark fruits, licorice up front. Middle of taste the notes of oak and bourbon are present with strong licorice flavors. Hop oils appear piney at the end. Not a big fan of licorice but doesn't take too much away. 
M: Thick but was expecting it to be a bit more chewy. Resiny.
D: This beer is complex and strong but quite drinkable. 535 characterscamp0474, Feb 22, 2011
4.15/5  rDev -7.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.52007 vintage (consumed on 2/9/11):
A huge thanks to ThreeWiseMen for sharing this with JustinA1 and myself. Poured into a snifter.
Pours out pitch black, perhaps the blackest stout I have seen. A small dark tan head emerges and swirling gives the head a nice foamy texture. Allowing the beer to settle the head recedes to a ring around the glass. Absolutely no light is getting though the body of this even if you held it up next to a light. A very nice looking RIS.
Huge roast is the first thing to greet the nose. Followed up by molasses and some other sweetness (perhaps some chocolate?). No licorice is present but that could be because of the age of the bottle. Slight charred notes emerges as the beer warms.
Much like the smell, roast and molasses are the most noticeable elements in the taste. The sweetness from the molasses lingers in the taste well after the beer is swallowed. Scorched sugars presents itself as times goes on. A bitterness is also found in the finish and a hint of smokiness. This is a very unique tasting beer and the three of us agreed we hadn't had anything like it before.
A bit light for a RIS but perhaps that's due to the age (no idea if aging can really thin a beer, going to have to open a 2010 to see if there is a difference). It's not that it's thin, it's just light, like mousse. The liquid is very smooth and it goes down incredibly well. I want to give this a 4.25. (Gave this a 4.5 to end up with the A- range I was looking for)
This was a very unique taste experience for sure. I think that the 07s are holding up very well. The flavor profile is very nice but yet subtle and have to sort of dig for some flavors at first. I don't know how much longer this would have continued to age and get better. If you have an 07 you will no be disappointed if you open it up now. 1,820 charactersSwimsum, Feb 22, 2011

A: Pours extremely dark black with a thick two finger mocha head. The foam lasts for a very long time leaving sheets of lacing behind on the glass. 
S: Roasted malts, some coffee, and lots of dark chocolate. There is a little bit of molasses, licorice, and a touch of bourbon. 
T: Very complex flavor profile here. A really nice combination of mocha, coffee, and chocolate dominate the flavor profile. There are also hints of wood and some roasted flavor as well. 
M/D: Has a heavier/thicker mouthfeel, but drinks very smooth. Slightly dry. I did not get much heat from this bottle. Overall, easily one of my favorite Imperial Stouts to date. Can't wait to have this one again and will always be happy to have some in the cellar. 799 charactersmdaschaf, Feb 21, 2011
4.49/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 42010 vintage poured into my Jester King snifter
Pours black with a thin toffee colored head, the beer certainly lives up to it's name. No light looks like it's getting through this beer.
Coffee comes through well with chocolate and caramel accenting, a bourbon and oak smell is pretty strong too. Cherry aroma is also present as well as some toffee. 
Very complex and very very good. Strong coffee and caramel up front followed by a smokey oak note, licorice flavor comes through on the finish as well as a bourbon, cherry and coffee after taste, the alcohol shows itself by heating up every thing it touches after a while but it's muted very well by all of the flavors coming through.
Heavy in body and very smooth and creamy, low carbonation accents the creaminess. Very drinkable though it took me a good ten minutes to get my nose out of the glass and take a sip! A great sipping beer and certainly worthy of the esteem it's given. 939 charactersFenris244, Feb 21, 2011

Pours a black body with a chocolate head. Good head retention with some decent lacing. Aromas of roast malt and oak from the nose. I can detect a slight scent of alcohol as well. Roasted malt, a touch of black licorice and lots of smooth molasses on the front of the flavor. Dark chocolate and bourbon on the finish. The body is will balanced and smooth, however there is an alcohol bite on the finish. I liked Abyss, but I didn't love it. I would certainly drink it again (a sipper) especially if it had some age on it. 534 charactersSiepJones, Feb 21, 2011

A - The head is prominent, but is not tan, it is rather dark. It makes for an interesting looking stout, and for a beer I want to try.
S - Little muted. Some coffee tones, backed up by some licorice. A little brown sugar in the nose.
T - Better than the smell. Coffee is up front and in your face on this one. This is followed toffee and chocolate. The bourbon is there, but it is very subtle.
M - Not my favorite here. For a stout this does not coat the mouth. It also finishes a bit dry. 
D - The taste is pretty good. I feel like one bottle would do me though. The mouthfeel is just not what I am looking for when I head for a stout. 713 charactersdecadance, Feb 20, 2011
5/5  rDev +11.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Pours into the snifter a beautiful creamy jet black. The one-finger head has a nice reddish tinge and the lacing while drinking is subtle but attractive. The smell is, for lack of a better word, divine: the chocolate and roasted malt are obvious, but the oak and molasses are the true stars. The taste is exactly what the nose advertises: a wonderful combination of the bitterness of the chocolate and sweetness of the molasses, with some bourboniness (is that a word?) for good measure. Very creamy and rich, and not overcarbonated. The alcohol is (perhaps dangerously) undetectable. Leaves a lingering warmth with almost no aftertaste.
FourthBeer potential: ABSOLUTELY. Plain and simple, this isn't just a beer, it's an experience, and is truly worthy of all 5s. And while I drank this entire bottle solo, this is one of those beers that I would enjoy sharing with others (especially given the ABV). 902 characterskinupanda, Feb 18, 2011

4.68/5  rDev +4.5%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Abyss 2010 on tap in the Portland pub in January. Reviewed from somewhat rudimentary notes. Review will be updated with future tastings.
A - Black as night with a light brown 2 finger head. Incredible lacing.
S - Cocoa and roasted malt. Not so much as a hint of the booze. It's really wonderful. 
T - Amazing cocoa, roasted malts. Lots of chocolate and hints of coffee with a hint of some dark fruits, perhaps fig. A bit less complex as I was expecting - I can't pick up any of the licroice, for example - but it is undoubtedly delicious. Only hints of booze.
M - Creamy and delicious. Full bodied with a nicely soothing alcohol warmth in the back end. Slightly dry finish.
D - Unbelievable. So tasty and so easy to drink. Such a high ABV, yet the booze doesn't show up very much, and it only appears in just the right way, as a warming effect. This is certainly the best stout I have yet had.
OTHER NOTES: I also had the opportunity to taste an infected bottle from 2009. Tasted January 2011 (some weeks after I had had the 2010 on tap), the bottle listed best after 11/1/2010. The spoiled beer was similar in aromatic profile, but with an added bacterial funkiness. The funk was present in the taste as well. That said, the feel and appearance were unaffected. The beer was still fairly drinkable, and I'd probably have scored it somwhere in the 3.5-3.7 range. 1,368 charactersgreenmonstah, Feb 16, 2011

Poured into an oversized wine glass
*Had only had the 09' prior with infection, and the fresh 10' was exceptional!
Appearance: Foreboding, thick, black, utterly opaque. Small coffee colored head which dies down quickly, and leaves no lacing.
Smell: Definite black licorice, molasses, bourbon, booze, and dark fruit on the nose. There is also some really nice, full roasted malt flavor imparting some coffee like notes as well.
Taste: Malt forward with some sweetness, and same molasses and black licorice flavors that were on the nose. there's some moderate alcohol burn, but still rather smooth for an 11% stout. That said, after 11/15/11, this thing will likely taste sublime, as some of those more prominent flavors round out and the heat dies down slightly.
Mouthfeel: This is really the only place where i feel there was more to be desired. I felt it to feel rather thin, and not nearly as viscous as an "abysmal" stout ought to be (at least in my mind). In it's favor though, there is no cloying sweetness, nor overpowering other flavors.
Drinkability: I enjoyed sharing this for a special occasion. It proved to be a great conversation piece and a sipper undoubtedly. It's a great complex stout that doesn't attack you with a ridiculous ABV, nor does it leave you dissatisfied. Can't wait to see how this one ages... 1,363 charactersamcmaho1, Feb 16, 2011

 Pour results in an inky black-hole light sucking darkness with a fluffy tan two finger head that slowly receeds into a thin cap of foam that claws its way up the sides of the glass.
 Lots of aroma here, burnt malt, coffee, chocolate factory just great!
 Taste is like trying to discern the winner of a bar fight, so much going on here, Bitter chocolate, coffee, milk chocolate, malt sweetness and dare I say Hops, slightly floral and bitter. Changing like a chamelion as it warms, just getting better
 Not too thick, tight carbonation keeps it lively all the way down.
 World Class? Yep!

Pours a solid dark walnut out of the bottle into the glass. Faint solid brown head with some good staying power. Bubbles in the head are all uniform and manage to stick together on tilting the glass. Some small carbonation coming from the bottom but not alot. She's looks good to go. Whiskey thick legs giving leopard print style lacing on the glass. Looks great.
A small but detectable smell of molasses, and then gives way to a smokiness of smoked meat, specifically like smoked sausage. Smoke is salty in character. Licorice smells come out more noticeable on the bouquet after a few drinks. Small nose but noticeable not that exceptionally big or grand. Still solid.
Taste is a surprising hard to identify chocolate at first, and barrel notes of wood tannins. Fascinating finish of lime astringency without the bitterness. Smoked meat sensation is lost from the nose. Heat tannins stick to the roof palate of your mouth and dry you out a bit. Very tolerable carbonation but noticeable also.
Not completely masked abv but pretty good I must say for a very high eleven percent. Great tasting, a beer that changes personality in your hands while you consume it. Glad I had one, and for sure... I want another. 1,299 characterssmakawhat, Feb 11, 2011

T - Rich and creamy chocolate malty flavor. Hints of coffee and licorice. Goes down smooth and leaves a tasty chocolate bitter aftertaste. 
M - Full bodied. Nice thick and creamy. Moderate carbonation, does not detract from the taste.
D - Goes down incredibly easy considering this is a stout. Very impressive. 534 charactersbbb099, Feb 11, 2011

A: pours black, with mocha colored head, good retention
S. A balanced aroma of sweet and bitter. Baker's chocolate and coffee are present, also hints of oak licorice and molasses.
T: Very balanced, even while young. Chocolate and espresso as well as some sweetness from the licorice. Malts are present too. Not overpowering with alcohol either.
M/D: Super smooth and one of the most balanced beers I have had to date. There isn't any one thing that jumped out at me in this beer, and that's not a bad thing. 544 characterscpmichael, Feb 10, 2011
4.56/5  rDev +1.8%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5After a little over two years on BA...time for my 400th review!
2009 Reserve with a best after date 11/1/2010. Consumed on 2/9/2011. Poured into a snifter.
A- Pours an engine oil black color with very little light shining through around the edges. A nice 1 finger mauve colored head leaves rings of lace and has excellent retention.
S- Definitely picking up some bourbon with plenty of alcohol in the nose. Dark chocolate and some oak coming through as well. I'm noticing a slight bit of funk in the nose and I'm really hoping this one isn't infected. It's minor but I can pick it out. Hopefully its all in my head...
T- Pheww! It WAS all in my head! Warm rich chocolate flavor with tons of coffee coming through in the finish. As this warms, I'm picking up quite a bit more of the molasses and licorice along with some mocha, roasted malt, smoke, bittersweet chocolate, and anise. I have to concentrate to find the bourbon and oak in the flavor. They were both a bit more pronounced in the nose.
M- Full bodied with an incredibly smooth rich feel. The alcohol is very well hidden and I can tell that one year of age did some mellowing to that heat.
D- Wow. Truly a deeply complex brew that is dangerously drinkable. I can't tell if the alcohol is just surprisingly well hidden, or if all of the rich flavor just keeps me from noticing it. Drink with responsibility and caution! Enjoy :) 1,393 charactersprojectflam86, Feb 10, 2011

The inside of the bottle cap says "BRAVELY DONE", which I guess is the reward for getting through the wax seal. I can't tell if it's supposed to be laudatory or mocking.
A: Blackety black black body without a hint of light getting through. Modest tan head with a bit of lacing.
S: Chocolate, molasses, bourbon, and alcohol. Like dessert and a nightcap in one.
T: More chocolate and molasses. Subtle bourbon notes. Plenty of initial alcohol heat that recedes as it becomes warmer. Becomes exponentially better as it warms up.
M: Thick and creamy. Thinning effect from the alcohol.
D: As far as stouts go, this is a first-round knockout. Like I said, it improves greatly as it warms up. Unfortunately, this means that it reached its peak right when I was almost done with the bottle. But like they say in showbiz, always leave them wanting more. I can see this improving with age, but it's plenty good right now. 1,014 charactersBarrelO, Feb 10, 2011
4.45/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 22 oz. bottle into a tulip. 2010 version.
Appearance: This pours somewhere between mahogany and black, with a ruby walnut corner in the middle. A creamy brown cap sits on top, fading to a few islands after a short while and leavin a few spots of lace.
Smell: Roasted malt, dark chocolate, anise, smooth mild coffee, and a bit of earthy hops. Great balance and depth in the aroma.
Taste: The roasted malt and espresso are the first two flavors to hit my palate. A little bit of dark chocolate integrates well with anise, vanilla, and oak. There are some earthy hops that blend well with the anise as well. The end of each sip warms the stomach. 
Mouthfeel: I felt like this got a bit syrupy, which is the only true detractor for me. It has a huge body, a great creaminess, but the light carbonation contributes to the syrupy feel for sure. There is some light residue that sits on the tongue afterward.
Drinkability: This reminds me of Stone's IRS in how balanced it is. Not a coffee or chocolate bomb, Abyss simply presents a variety of enjoyable flavors to you, one after another, letting them integrate over time. A very relaxing sipper. 1,158 charactersKickInTheChalice, Feb 09, 2011

Infected
A: Pours "stout like" except for the mocha head rapidly rising to massive proportions within my glass. Odd....
S: Sour! Sour cherries, lactic presence. The base beer is almost completely masked. A boozy Flanders Oude Bruin... 
T: Not terrible I guess. It sort of reminds me of the zwet.be from 3 fonteinen I had somewhat recently, just not as well crafted....and with alot more cherry. The infection in my bottle must be pretty far along, the sour cherry aspect is still prominent over the base beer.
Hope to taste 2010 soon 550 charactersbeerpirates, Feb 08, 2011
4.72/5  rDev +5.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5It pours a coal black liquid with a short living head of foam. Head however laces the glass all the way down to the last drop.
It smells of alcohol and roasted bitter chocolatey greatness. A semi sweet kick of some vanilla I think due to barrel aging
Its very smooth in the mouth with a kick of alcohol. carbonation up front with a Hershey chocolate syrup finish. AMAZING. I get a slight oakyness in the middle of this but not very noticible till the end when you get an aftertaste of roasted wood with the chocolate. 
I am thoroughly convinced this is one of my top 3 imperial stouts . 589 charactersbadboyrsl84, Feb 08, 2011

Half the contents of a 22 oz. 2010 vintage poured into my Aventinus Eisbock glass. 
Appearance: Poured a pitch black with little to no head, decent lacing. 
Smell: Roasted malt with a sweetness, either licorice or molasses. Really rich smell. 
Taste: Great beer, subtle bourbon lurking beneath the rich malty sweetness. Really like what the licorice and molasses add to this beer. Very well balanced and delicious.
Mouth feel: Very smooth with nice warmth on the finish.
Drinkability: Great depth of flavor, alcohol completely masked. A great drinking beverage for a winter's night. 628 charactersBobZ, Feb 08, 2011
4.68/5  rDev +4.5%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Undated notes from a recent trip to the Portland brew pub. Served in a 300 ml conical glass and paired with an elk burger and sweet potato fries for lunch. Wet dreams are made from lunches such as this.
It's been a while since I've had un-infected Abyss and this was my first taste of the 2010 batch. Boy-oh-boy what a revelation this batch is...
A: The previously described conical glass arrived to the table with about two inches of tight espresso like foam sitting on top of text book inky blackness. The lacing that The Abyss puts off is just amazing in this format. The foam NEVER faded. 5/5
S: Strong cocoa powder is supported by anise and soft bourbon notes. A treat in a glass is promised. 4.5/5
T: Light vinous notes meld well with the decadent chocolate richness that is amplified to the mousse level by the nitro. Brown liquor is gently warms and brings with it some nice caramel. Bitter cold pressed coffee rounds out the finish and lingers alongside the bourbon notes. This is just a rich complex dessert in a glass. 4.5/5
M: Again the nitro helps improve the score. The creamy elixir is just so damn smooth of the palate. Like a thick chocolate milkshake, a mustache of foam can be left on my upper lip and complete my audition for any future "Got Abyss" billboards. 5/5
D: Fuhgit abaht it... Bahtendah... Ahl 'ave anothuh. 5/5 1,347 charactershopsbreath, Feb 08, 2011
5/5  rDev +11.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5really excited about this one...so going into this with some high expectations. 2010 bottle.
a - if you ever want to make a statement about the ability to age your beer and specialness of cracking it open, waxing the cap would be it. i cut the wax with a straight razor and made work on the waxy cap. after a little bit of work it came off and revealed "Bravely Done" on the inside of the cap...another nice touch. poured a generous portion into my oversized snifter. gorgeously silky black with a soft tan creamy head. leaves a nice spotty trail of lacing when swirling the glass. so far, so good.
s - malty chocolate with a subtle bourbon tease. non offensive and not overly boozy at all. every part of the flavor compliments every other part.
t - YUM. caramel, chocolate, roastiness, subtle wood and bourbon. 
m - smooth and bready with a nice bourbony tingle. the wood effect is subtle and creamy and the mouth is cooling. 
d - as a really big fan of black ops, this is a beer that brings back that same joy of discovery as my first taste of that beer. i'm glad that i have a few more bottles of this and i'm glad that i opened this now. i only wish this was easier to come by for me. it is beautifully balanced and a real treat in every way. a really fantastic beer. this beer stepped to the plate, pointed at the fences...and then hit a home run on the first pitch.

really excited to try the 2011 version of this. thanks a ton brad for zipping this out to me as soon as it hit your shelves! SUPER appreciated.
a - pried the wax and removed the cap...bravely done. filled my cbs snifter. ah...there she is in all her golden silky black glory with that creamy mocha head, seems a bit more frothy than last years. my mouth is literally watering.
s - BAM! milk chocolate roasted malt perfection. i'm not getting the bourbon as much, but looks like the mix is a bit different. the label says with cherry bark and vanilla with a mix of small percentages aged in various barrels (oak bourbon, oak, and oak wine). definitely tamer than last year...i can pick out a bit of the cherry and white wine, but the bourbon is not in the smell at all...and the oak is overall more timid...
t - again, the first thing that jumps out at me is the lack of that bourbon blast. thick decadent chocolate with some mellowing from the oak. the wine seems to shine through most on the flavoring from the barrel and there is a slight hint of cherry.
m - smooth and creamy
o - overall, still a solid beer. that being said, i don't understand how they could've played with such a perfect beer and changed the blend. i guess i'll have to hold my 2010's a bit tighter since 2011 is different and lacks a lot of what i love about 2010. still great, just not as great. much more milk chocolate.

VINTAGE 2008! (thanks pintplease)
pried the wax off to reveal a 20th anniversary (1988 to 2008) cap. excellent. opened carefully and filled my deschutes snifter.
a - stunning. deep black with a creamy mocha tan head...milkshakey lacing. doesn't get any better than this.
s - deep rich chocolate milk. creamy...perfect.

Man this beer was insane. We popped a 2010 vintage open at a party to share among a group of beer lovers. People marveled at how it poured so indescribably black. People commented that they thought we were drinking soy sauce. It coats the glass and looks like you are chugging engine oil. Smell was out of this world, an amalgam of various sweet and savory flavors that was almost overwhelming. I couldn't drink more than about 4oz of it and not sure i could ever finish a whole bottle. One note was that for such a strong beer the alcohol was hidden surprisingly well. My compatriots and i were surprised when we saw the 11% on there, which was a welcome change from the heavy beers we tend to try. 745 charactersBeernf, Feb 06, 2011
4.62/5  rDev +3.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.52010 bottle poured into my tulip glass.
The appearance is motor oil black with a rich creamy brown head.
The smell is phenomenal. A sweet smell of caramel, chocolate, and coffee. The alcohol smell is very present. There was also something else I couldn't put my finger on... I thought it was licorice and while looking at the bottle I realized they brewed it with licorice!
The taste is very similar to the smell. Upfront is chocolate. The middletaste is sweet chocolate, licorice, coffee, and faint caramel. The finishing flavor is like chocolate and coffee had dirty drunken sex... and it was good.
The mouthfeel is creamy smooth.
I would say it has pretty good drinkability, but since its such a good beer you almost feel bad drinking it. I could/would knock a few of these out easily. 793 charactersadamhimself, Feb 05, 2011
4.55/5  rDev +1.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.52010 Vintage. Poured into snifter. I was so excited after getting my hands on a couple 2009 vintages, only to find them to be a sour cherry funk mess. I had to try this stuff again, and this time I was far from disappointed. 
A - The Abyss fits its namesake perfectly. This thing is black as night, with a gorgeous dark tan head. 
S - Awesome smell. Heavy roasted coffee bean smell; and hints of bitter chocolate, milk chocolate, vanilla, and alcohol. 
T - Wow this thing tastes great. That hint of alcohol smell I got is nowhere to be found in the taste. Dark chocolate, milk chocolate, coffee, fudge, ever so slight oak. I love that they only blend 33% in oak and oak bourbon barrels because this doesn't contain any of the burn, alcohol heat, or phenol traces found in 100% barrel stouts such as Goose Island BCS (although I like that beer too). This blend is just perfect. Tastes like a delicious coffee fudge put into liquid form. I could go on all day...
M - Very good mouthfeel. Those tiny carbonation bubbles that I love. Creamy, nice thickness. 
D - I downed my 22 ounce bottle no problem, wishing I had more. Drinkability on this thing is great.
Wow, what a great beer. After the letdown that was the 2009 batch, and the letdown (for me) that was the black butte porter, I was expecting the worse; but this beer out-did all my expectations. I was only lucky enough to snag two bottles, but I wish I had two cases of this stuff. I hope the rumors are true, and Deschutes is coming to Wisconsin soon, hopefully by the next time The Abyss is released. 1,564 charactersCurtisLoew, Feb 05, 2011

A: This one pours bitch black in color as the name would imply. The head is mocha in color and has pretty good retention and excellent lacing.
S: A lot of dark chocolate and roast. There's a bit of sweet maple syrup on the nose.
T: The taste is dominated by roasty malts. I get some milk chocolate in the middle and there's a little bit of nuttiness in the aftertaste. Overall a very balanced beer with a pleasant taste. The etoh is undetectable. 
M: Near perfect for the style. Nice viscosity, perfect level of viscosity. Great aftertaste
D: For the style the drinkability is pretty good. The drinkability is probably only limited by the abv and the heaviness. I am glad this was easy to find as I'm excited to have it again sometime. 762 charactersglazeman, Feb 05, 2011

A: Somewhat surprising how light colored the head is, as the beer is pitch black. Two finger mocha head that recedes very slowly with some huge bubbles and leaves some great lacing right off the bat.
S: Coffee, roasted malts, something spicy and cinnamon like, the licorice probably. As it comes out I get more sweetness, bourbon, and wood.
T: Metallic? Too boozy. Great hop presence, seeming like the opposite of an IPA where the hops are a nice backbone to everything else. Some woody smokiness as it warms, and bourbon following that as it continues. The licorice also adds a nice background flavor, but the stinging metallic taste is really detracting for me. Very dry earthy finish.
M: Sharp. I've never used that to describe a beer before, but this really does just kind of feel sharp. I think it comes from the alcohol sting combined with a really bitter, dry finish.
D: The finish leaves me coming back for more, not because I really want it but because I'm trying to figure out what this strange mix of flavors going on is. 1,196 characterstsatem, Feb 04, 2011

A - I like the greeting from the underside of the bottle cap - "Bravely Done." This pours an epically dark black that scares you. There is a substantially dense looking brown head. Looks amazing.
S - Toffee, roasted caramel, oak, licorice, chocolate, and a touch of bourbon. Delightfully complex. Bourbon comes out quite a bit as the beer warms.
T - What a big taste! An intense woody dryness accompanies a licorice/chocolate sweetness on the front, and the dark chocolatey and roasty flavors come out towards the back. I look forward to this with some age on it, but fresh it's pretty hot. It's still good, but I think a bit crude. These flavors could take some time to round out a bit. It all evens out more as it warms.
M - A pretty nice and robust mouthfeel, fairly viscous, a bit chewy. It's not that smooth, feels a bit heavy on the carbonation and dryness. Again, I imagine the age will help out here.
D - Well, it's too hot right now. But I still think it tastes great and is hard to keep away from. 1,180 charactersColdPoncho, Feb 04, 2011

Smell has a hint of bourbon, lots of chocolate, vanilla and some dark fruits. Taste is of vanilla, dark chocolate, coffee, roasted malts, not a lot of booze. This beer drinks almost too well for an 11% huge stout. Mouthfeel is perfect, medium carbonation, well balanced. Best stout I have ever had. Great job! 484 charactersdchew85, Feb 04, 2011

4.32/5  rDev -3.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4I love this beer. I had a bottle of 2009 and though it was slightly off it was still very good. But since it wasn't as good as it could have been I will just review the 2010. It pours black with a half inch of of tan head that seemed to stick around for days... It looked fantastic in my stone IRS tulip. I couldn't wait to dive in to this glass of motor oil. The smell was as good as a stout gets. Oak, chocolate malts, vanilla, molasses, bourbon round off the initial whiff. The smells brown sugar and chocolate/vanilla stick around the longest. Love it! The taste is amazing all the smells shine through in the taste, the sweet yet awesomely bitter taste keeps me going back for more. The first third of the bottle has lots of oak and chocolate malts with a ton of sweet molasses on the finish. The bourbon flavor is a bit subdued and I'm sure that's bc it is only 33% aged in barrels. The beer is a bit rough on the edges and all I can think is how good it will be in 1,2 or even 3 years from now if I can wait that long to revisit it (have 2 more bottles). Overall it is a fantastic beer to drink now even though it is a bit young. I feel this could be one of my favorite beers if it ages to the potential I think it has. If you can find a bottle hold onto it and if you can find 2 or more drink 1 now and you won't be disappointed! 1,337 charactersHopMasterFlex, Feb 03, 2011

A- Poured into an oversized snifter... Starts with a 1/2" thick brown head. Lingers momentarily before disappearing leaving some light lacing. Beer is black in color; no light shines through when held up to the ceiling
S- First wiff provides some light malts, chocolate, and wood. After some swirls of the snifter, nose is a bit more pungent with a bit more of the barrel aging aroma coming through
T- Starts out chocolatey, balanced very nicely with a dark fruity malt sweetness. Finish is also chocolatey accompanied by some light bitterness
M- By far the best attibute of this brew. Light carbonation, but so thick you can almost chew it

4.57/5  rDev +2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Finally got to try this beer! Vintage 2010.
Pours a pitch black and opaque color with a light brown head showing nice retention and lacing.
Aroma is absurdly complex: dark malts, mollasses, chocolate, vanilla/bourbon, smoke and light booze. Something reminded me also of the smell you feel when you are by the ocean (minerally notes maybe)...weird. Anyway, this is an exceptional smelling brew.
Taste starts with lots of dark malts, chocolate, tons of molasses, licorice, slight dark fruit, smoke malt/wood and ends with coffee notes. Wow, even better than the aroma.
Body is huge and complex, with low to medium carbonation. I finally get some hop presence towards the very end. Not much bourbon character in the taste.
Top notch imperial stout, probably one of the best beers I've ever had. A must try. 810 characterspaulozanello, Feb 02, 2011
4.45/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 422oz bottle poured into snifter - 2010 vintage
Pours a midnight inky black, a bubbly coffee brown head fades into film which leaves behind curtains of tanned lacing along the glass.
Intense scents of chocolate, earthy oaked bourbon, molasses, lighter licorice, a touch of molasses sweetness, and boozy warmth. 
Warm roasted malt up front with vanilla and molasses accents. Smooth bourbon undertones with some richer chocolate splashes. Very slight smoke and coffee, followed by some syrupyness and pleasantly subdued licorice. Plenty of boozy warmth towards the finish but manages to leave the profile in tact.
Ultra velvet cloudy smoothness, milder carbonation, full syrupy body. So delicious and pleasant on all the senses, one of the better imperial stouts I've had lately, especially since this was a beer I've been waiting about two years to try. Some age on this would be even better, as the alcohol heat was probably the only obvious negative aspect. 961 charactersxnicknj, Feb 02, 2011
4.42/5  rDev -1.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Review # 800!
2010 vintage, consumed February 1st, 2011 at 50 degrees F in my trusty Triple Petrus snifter.
Beer pours black with a dark brown two-finger head that quickly becomes nothing but a very sticky crown. Expected the head to last longer...
Aroma is a delicious melange of chocolate/cocoa, vanilla, and a slight, boozy whiskey note.
Flavors... where to start? Obviously, massive dark malts and chocolate. Bitterness like coffee. A bit of a lactic note and a slight smoke/ash nuance sneak in. Some dark fruit (raisins, mainly, though for some reason I keep thinking of apricot brandy). Molasses provides a sort of bitter brown sugar floor for all the other flavors. Not too sweet and not too bitter; smoother and more balanced than some of the big stouts I've had. Absolutely no inkling that this is 11% ABV from the flavor.
Mouthfeel is thick and slightly creamy with an ever-so-slightly dry and vaguely tingly finish. Alcohol heat present but tolerable.
This is a real contender, but it's drinking so well fresh that I have a hard time imagining how this will improve with age. I'll let you know... 1,113 characterscharlzm, Feb 02, 2011

It is the first thing I am tasting in the morning, and it is probably the best tasting thing I will have all day! Overall, the beer is not too sweet (as I expected), but I plan on sitting on one for a while to see how its flavor profile develops. 808 characterspeacebone116, Feb 01, 2011

4.6/5  rDev +2.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from 22oz bottle (2008 Reserve - 20th Anniversary bottle - I also tried the most recent years going forward which pretty much shared similiar taste) into tulip glass. Pours a really dark black with a nice consistency and a thin dark tan head. Nice sweet aromatics - licorice, molasses, coffee, roasty, oak, and some dark fruits. Talk about nice complexity! The flavor is roasty, warming, fruity, warming alcohol, coffee, chocolate, lots of wood, molasses, light barrel aging, a sort of vinous quality. The palate is first cocoa which leads to roasted coffee and a sweetness that reminds you of molasses, some licorice, and finishes sweet as well. Slight vanilla and wood flavors mid palate. This quickly became one of my favorite Americal Double / Imperial Stouts out there! 781 charactersCuriousMonk, Jan 31, 2011

3.78/5  rDev -15.6%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Re=Review for 2010 Bottle of Abyss. Had at a local BA tasting.
Pours a crude oil black with no hint of light pearing threw. Head is formed with little effort and is a shade of chocolate brown. Aroma is their with roasty nose and a slight malt background. The aroma was a bit on the weak side but still enjoyable. Flavor was extremely roasty and pretty much overwhelmingly roasted flavors. The brew was nice the but the roasted flavors were very strong and was just not to my liking. I feel with a year on this brew or more this could be a wonderful RIS.
Traded a 2009 Darklord for this bottle of 2009 Vintage Abyss.
When first opened noticed a lack of pop to the bottle was not sure if this was standard as I have never had this particular brew. Lack of head I felt was standard but even throwing it at the glass left no head to be seen or form. The smell was of a wet roasty smell with sour notes to it. Taste was far from a RIS and was straight sour and could not be consumed. The sour notes strongly took over any other flavors from this brew. Popped this bottle at a tasting and everyone in the room was unable to consume said beer. It was not a great night for the Abyss.
Hopefully will land a 2010 bottle and will re-review. 1,233 charactersBZero007, Jan 30, 2011
4.75/5  rDev +6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5A - poured in a pint, very dark, pitch black, put against the light the blackness had some red to it which was cool! brownish head that's really thick and recedes slowly, leaving a very nice looking lace. 
S - awesome! milky to dark chocolate, coffee, sweet, a little hoppy and alcoholic aroma that's perfect for this beer.
T - milk and dark chocolates, a perfect coffee taste, malty, toffee, caramel, sweet and savory, bitter is present but not overpowering. alcohol flavor is not evident which make this brew great. 
M - full bodied, very creamy, very smooth, everything is balanced, bittersweet at first, chocolates in the middle, then finishes clean with a little coffee aftertaste. 
D - very drinkable, every flavor is well balanced. had this beer for the first time last night and I enjoyed every sip of it. will not give this a perfect score yet. need to wait for 10 more months to taste the aged perfect version, per label's instruction. then maybe I'll be giving this perfect beer a perfect score. 1,006 charactersdiomz88, Jan 30, 2011
4.6/5  rDev +2.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 52010 bottle. Pours a pitch black color, developing a small, brown colored head that recedes fairly quickly, not leaving lace on the glass so much as depositing oil-like slicks of beer that pull down with each sip.
Aroma is nice and intense, a mild roast character initially which falls into some chocolate and coffee notes. Some vanilla and oak from the barrel, not a whole lot of bourbon, which is kinda nice for once.
The flavor is a complex combination of malt and barrel characteristics which combine to make and outstanding Imperial Stout. The malt characteristics really shine, some slightly roasted and chocolate notes and strong dark caramel character, followed quickly by wood notes of vanilla, toasted marshmallow and just a hint of bourbon. 
The Abyss is incredibly well balanced and easy drinking even fresh. Mouthfeel is thick and viscous, just coating the palate in delicious flavors. It really is smooth and mellow, and might just be one of the best -bal aged beers I've had. Considering how easy drinking it is now, I can only imagine how delicious it will be when I open my second bottle next December. 1,122 charactersSoneast, Jan 30, 2011

A: I can't see a damn thing, black as night with peanut brown head disapearing quickly. beautiful lacing sticking to glass. 
S: Coffee notes in the forefront, some chocolate undernieth, alcohol is present in the nose.enough is enough lets drink!
T: Holy Shit!, I can't believe the taste of this. I don't know what to say. I don't taste any alcohol in this. It is unbelievably balanced. very complex with initial hints of licorice and molasses leading into subtle wave of coffee notes. ending with a perfect bitterness to dry out the palate so more is a necessity. 
M: best mouthfeel of any stout hands down. so smooth. wow.
D & Overall: As this warms its getting better, if thats possible. I received this in a trade. If i lived on the west coast I would by cases of this and live a happy happy man. stouts are style and this is tops to me. perfect 5s all the way around. the hype is justified.

4.53/5  rDev +1.1%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5For a while, I didn't really seek this beer out, as I'm not a fan of licorice/anise. When it was announced this beer was coming to Texas, I decided to give it a try. Well, I'm very glad I did.
Pours like motor oil into my Portsmouth tulip that STEG gave me (TWINSIES!), creating a nice, thick dark tan/light brown head. Looks amazing, just how I'd want a big bold stout to look.
The aroma is pretty fantastic as well. I'm getting good amounts of chocolate, leather, smoke, molasses and maybe a hint of anise. Some nice bourbon introducing itself as well.
Wow, this is very, very good. I'm impressed. Taste follows the nose, and doesn't hold back. I don't need to retype everything from above. Roasty. I really like this beer a lot, and I am not at all basing any of this off of hype. Like I said before, I was "skeptical" of this beer for a while. I hate strong anise, but I'm not getting too much from this. Some on the finish, but it plays a more complimentary role.
Feels great in the mouth. Full bodied and just the right amount of carbonation. Not too heavy.
Considering this is 11% abv, I'd say the drinkability is pretty good. I'm going through the first glass from this bomber pretty quickly. The abv is actually pretty well hidden. And what matters most is that my folks, having each took a sip or two, thought it was pretty damn tasty. 1,350 charactersjefferz5000, Jan 30, 2011
4.66/5  rDev +4%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Thankyou so much to Philhyde for sending me a bottle of this.
Poured into a snifter. Pours opague black with an extremely thick creamy brown heading. Lacing ring's and globs are everywhere. Beautiful ringlets left all throughout the tasting.
Smell is mostly heavy roasted malts upfront. Some lighter sweeter chocolate notes.Subtle boozey barrel aroma's move in for a soft finish. Nothing spectacular I am thinking.
Taste well is in another category. Simple phenomenol I put it. Naturally the heavy roasted malts make their way through the palate. The powderey chocolatey-molasses mix barges it's way in and leaves you with a licorice finish. The bourbon barrel - oak taste is only there to kind of bind this big monster together.
Mouth is super smooth.Velvety and an incredible palate with a nice creamy texture and slight heat from the booze. Very alive on the palate never thick or chewy very easy to go down. Slight stickiness is left on the lips.
Final notes. This beer is scary. How the hell can a beer this high in alcohol be so drinkable.
Astonishing beer. 1,069 charactersTheFightfan1, Jan 29, 2011
5/5  rDev +11.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Here's the deal...this beer is perfect, in every way (like Mary Poppins). 
Pour: Deep, dark black; entirely like the deepest voids in space with an espresso brown head that initially foams up to nearly 2-3 fingers. The head lasts until the last drop is gone...the legs swirl through the entirety of the beers life as well.
Nose: Dark chocolate, bitter coffee, dark, roasted Malta, licorice, hints of molasses, slight hops, oak, and well integrated soft shades of bourbon (vanilla, caramel, toasted coconut, and charred oak).
Taste: Exactly like the nose. The taste of this beer is entirely complex, but so very well integrated. Add in slight cherry notes as well as some darker fruits (slight raisin an fig). Perfect taste profile.
Mouthfeel: creamy, velvety smooth. This beer coats the mouth and tongue and never entirely disappears. Chewy but not viscous or overwhelming. Perfect.
Overall: Why don't I buy a case of this every year? I will this next year...this is my perfect beer. Deschutes, I love you. 1,011 characterswaltersrj, Jan 29, 2011
4.5/5  rDev +0.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.52010 Reserve. 11% ABV. Killed 10 months before it's best after date.
Poured into a Guinness pint glass, this is some seriously viscous stuff and I can already smell the sweet chocolate coffee notes from a foot away. Deep dark black/brown it looks like espresso being poured but with a thicker almost liqueur-like viscosity. Kahlua? Motor oil? Pours a beautiful glossy opaque midnight black pint with a chocolaty white/brown frothy head. The lacing is incredibly fine. 
Nose is extremely rich with sweet chocolate malt. Only a hint of alcohol, there is some coffee and molasses in the background but mostly this smells like pure dense sweet chocolate fudge.
Bold on the attack, there is a lot going on on the palate. While the nose makes you expect this to be sweet and milky, the actual taste heads a different direction. Lots of alcohol, though it's balanced by the huge thick roasted malt flavors that caress your palate with near perfect soft velvety texture. Lots of bitterness, the licorice and coffee notes are powerful and the bourbon oak component is definitely there, though it's already better integrated than most bourbon barrel aged beers that can often seem overly boozy. 
For all the bombast and complex flavors going on, the main impression is that this is incredibly drinkable and harmonious for such a big beer. You can really see how some cellaring should round off the licorice/oak/alcohol and make this even more smooth and sublime. Hard to imagine a better example of an Imperial Stout. Need to stop drinking this so fast...22oz @ 11% = TKO. 1,566 charactersgpatt55, Jan 29, 2011

A - Popping the bottle cap reveals the inscription, "BRAVELY DONE". Poured into a snifter this beer has the look of motor oil. The blackest brew I've ever witnessed. The head is shy of an inch but has solid stamina, rich texture and creates an airy mound where the pour met the fill.
S - Anise, dark chocolate, rich and sweet worschestershire, and a hint of rootbeer. 
T - Long roasted malts are the prevailing taste. They finish in an amazing array of tasty coffee flavors. The beginning has black licorice and semi-sweet chocolate. The middle and ending are chocolatey and roasty. I'm unaware as to how this beer's flavors can be improved.
M - Velvet and silky smooth in my mouth. It leaves a sweet stickiness on my lips everytime I take a sip.
 ~ There is a reason this brew is so sought after. Everything about it is amazing. A beer like this makes me want to move to Oregon just to have access. There is no Imperial Stout that I have encountered that is better. 1,066 characterscdkrenz, Jan 29, 2011
5/5  rDev +11.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I know I'm supposed to use the 5.0 rating rarely, but I reserve this for a rare beer that surpasses all in my opinion. And here is why:
This beer is pitch black. Riddick couldn't see through the glass even with his shine job. The head, which with perfect carbonation was an amazing dark chocolately brown.
Smoky, chocolaty with a hint of the roast. When you put your nose into it and smell, it takes everything in you to hold back tipping the glass to experience your first pull
But when you do, you are immediately rewarded! This is the most complexly flavorful YET completely smooth stout there is. Hands down. I've had them all pretty much, as its been my favorite beer since my dad had it in baby bottles back in the day. I kid. But seriously, the chocolate lingers perfectly, the coffee is perfect. 
It is a very heavy beer, but definitely not chewy. It wafts over the palate like a warm blanket but quickly recedes with the completion of the swallow. Deschhutes has always prided themselves on a perfect amount of carbonation, and this doesn't disappoint, as all the flavors bounce electrically all over the palate.
If I were a rich man, I'd by the rights to this beer and install it permanently in my house as a tap. It is a wonderfully delightful brew that will not disappoint. 1,290 charactersdeschutesGROWN, Jan 26, 2011

A: Black as oil. there is nothing more to describe about it but black. I mean dark black. Nice light brown head with nice lacing around the glass.

T: Best tasting stout I've ever had, and I've had many stouts before. Tasty dark chocolate and coffee blends nice. 
M: Nice thick roasty stout. Creamy and goes down very nice. The abv. does this beer no justice. At 11% you can hardly taste the alcohol, which makes it that much better.

4/5  rDev -10.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 3.5OK, quickie here. Loved watching the State of the Union. Good job by The President.
This beer is also a good job. As you might guess from a heavyweight Imperial Stout, it's super inky black, much like the Abyss...A creamy finger of foam pulls itself from the depths and slinks back into the chasm, leaving but a wisp of its passing. Lacing is sticky and prominent. Painfully expensive beer, and it's 11% ABV. Nose is awesome. Lots of strong dark chocolate notes, some vanilla, and certainly some bourbon from the barrel aging. I also catch some alcohol. Pretty nice. Flavor is super roasty, very complex, very well meshed. Flavors complement each other. Lots of tang from the chocolate malt, a wonderful barrel aging component - perfectly in balance. Late middle and, especially, in the finish I get some alcohol, a lot in the finish. That's the only knowck on this beer. Motuhfell might be best I've ever had. A perfect melding of carbonation, chewiness and openness...It feels thick at first, but then it eases, and the carbonation allows it to fill your mouth without billowing. It's wonderful. A pretty damn good beer and worth the price, but a skohsh below the elite ales of the World.
What I like most: The wonderful mouthfeel.
What I like least: The strong alcohol presence in the flavor profile.
Verdict: Absent the noticeable alcohol, this would be elite. As it is, this is awesome and worth the price. 1,415 charactersSolomonGrundy, Jan 26, 2011

Smell- Right off the bat you get with the scent of Vanilla, bourbon,alcohol, and wood. The aging of the beer comes through greatly in the smell, and it gives it that sweet vanilla smell that great aged bourbons get from the barrel-
Taste- Vanilla, bourbon, and alcohol. 
Feel- Rich and thick 
Drink- The alcohol really gets to you after you have finished a whole glass, but as you are drinking it, the sweet tastes of the beer, and that complex bourbon taste mask the high a.b.v on this bad boy.

4.53/5  rDev +1.1%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.52010 Vintage Reviewed In Early 2011:
Appearance: A perfectly impenetrable black inky body capped by a finger of tan head that fades slowly and leaves patchy lacing. The name is appropriate.
Aroma: A potent mix of espresso, 80%+ cacao dark chocolate, deep-roasted malt, sweet tobacco, citrusy hops, buttery caramel, rooty licorice, bourbon, and potent alcohol. This is going to be awesome.
Flavor: Up front, a charred malt blast with lots of notes of smoke, dark chocolate, dark coffee, and licorice. Towards the ends, two different elements come in to supplement the malt: bourbon whiskey and buttery caramel. There's nice alcohol throughout, but it doesn't seem like double-digit potency, even when warm. There's a hell of a lot going on here, but everything is balanced perfectly and the whole adds up to much more than the individual parts. Citrusy hops, charred malt, and buttery caramel in the finish.
Mouthfeel: Medium-full bodied, sticky, and slick with silky-smooth medium-light carbonation. A hint of burn from the alcohol, but this feels like it has much less alcohol content than it actually does.
Drinkability: For a beer with this much intense flavor and alcohol, this drinks criminally fast. Does Deschutes have a pact with the devil?
Verdict: This is an amazing Imperial Stout fresh; perhaps the best I've ever had. It's packed full of flavor, character, and booze but is somehow remarkably easily drinkable. As amazing as this is now, I cannot wait to see how this evolves over the next few years. 1,519 charactersBeanBone, Jan 23, 2011

A: deep dark black opaque body, topped nicely by a two inch head of mocha colored foam, this is just absolutely gorgeous for a year old 11% impy, lots of sticky lacing
N: dark chocolate notes, molasses, black licorice, tinge of coffee....complex, but not overbearing
T: similar to the nose, but more so...the chocolate notes are overtaken by molasses, vanilla, the bourbon barrel aging and hops are also present in a subtle way that gives the sweetness of the other flavors good balance, the bourbon hangs in the background for me and is not predominant....the hop notes are amazing considering this has been sitting for a year....just a wonderfully balanced beer in all aspects....exceedingly complex, yet very palatable
M: a beast, full bodied and palate assaulting, this is everything you would hope an impy stout would be...touch of alcohol makes itself known in the finish

Black as night, big mocha colored head, that stuck around for a minute and left a bit of lace. Alcohol feel were kickin'. 
Aroma was sweet, slightly bourbon-y, with licorice, chocolate and coffee.
Taste was oaky, with hints of coffee, anise, chocolate and molasses. 
Thick, chewy, syrupy. No carbonation. Linger was inevitable. Coats like a mink fur scarf. 
Not hard to drink...but the abv forces you to use judgement.

4.5/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I have had this numerous times on tap and in the bottle. Just had the 2010 version on tap tonight and am finally reviewing it (fitting for my 400th review). I was going to review this last week from my single '09 bottle I had left, but sadly, it was massively infected.
Appearance - Given in a generic tulip with over three fingers of tan mocha head. I let it sit for about five minutes before I even attempt to take a sip. The head is still half there...dissipating extremely slowly leaving chunky lacing on the sides of the glass. The beer is a massive dark color...no light penetrating. One of the better looking beers out there.
Smell - Chocolate, licorice, roasted malt, not as much "char" as prior years thankfully, coffee, oak, vanilla, and molasses. Smells delicious.
Taste - Similar to the aroma. Loads of bittersweet chocolate up front with a rather heavy licorice flavor. Roasted malts and coffee, slight citrus hops, in the middle. A nice oak and smokey taste comes in later on and ends with vanilla and molasses notes. This beer IS delicious.
Mouthfeel - Medium bodied, chewy and thick, lower carbonation.
Drinkability - I feel this years is a decent amount more drinkable than last years. This, while it does have alcohol warmth, does not show much heat while drinking. I'm glad I have four more of these in my cellar and hope they don't become "infected" as my '09 did. Cheers! 1,396 charactersSpdKilz, Jan 23, 2011

It's a one pint bottle. This is a great beer, like drinking a delicious bread. I paid about $13 for one bottle of this stuff, it was well worth it. Like the label says, it is a wonderful stout with licorice and molasses flavors. The 33% aged in oak barrels really comes through and makes for a unique brew. The 11% ABV doesn't even seem apparent since it's so easy on the palette. I wish it were cheaper and more available... but like one reviewer said "it's dangerously easy" to drink. 621 charactersGenji, Jan 23, 2011

4.33/5  rDev -3.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Darkest brown ranges the edges of this black stout; mocha head is super-sticky in the bar's goblet. For such a strong abv, this one has some great lace. Nose is a muted chocolate-fest: fudge, molassess, vanillin, hinting toward bourbon. Fainter than I remember the bottle, but still hitting some high notes. 
The flavor is so strong and complex, while remaining perfectly smooth. Very drinkable, despite the massive amounts of roasted barley, caramel, chocolate, coffee, and vanilla-bourbon. Somewhat boozy, but generally well hidden. Sweet and full without losing character or tipping into cloying and sticky. Hops help here; the citrus is pretty apparent even through the maltiness. 
I've had The Abyss in bottles many, many times - almost every time I see it, I clean out the store. Sorry...finding it on tap is a huge treat. Papago Brewing. 846 charactersBretSikkink, Jan 22, 2011

bottle to snifter
A big THANKS to poonamibaxter for the hookup on this one!!!
App- This was devoid of color, a vaccum if you will. No light passed through my glass. A pencil thin head that was a nice dark brown and fizzled quickly.
Smell- There is a lot going on in this glass. You start with some mild malt, then move to the big boozy, oaky vanilla notes. It's rounded out with some soft chocolate.
Taste- One big heavy ass stout. I love it. It's so complex on so many levels. A different taste bud erupts on each sip. The mouth awakens while drinking this one. 
Mouth- It's full bodied of course with a low carb and thick mouth feel. A meal in itself. The flavors play nicely and just keep evolving on your palate.
Drink- This was good when I had it at the OC fair in a plastic cup before I knew what Abyss was. In a snifter out of a sealed bottle. So much better. 891 charactersFosterJM, Jan 22, 2011
4.6/5  rDev +2.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Apperance: Pitch black no transparency at all. Head poured modest and dissipated with no signs or return. I aggitate in hops of stirring up some more of the beautiful mocha head but with little luck. Good lacing when the head is there.
Smell: I honestly thought I screwed up opening this 2010 early. I have a bunch and I'm aging some and will report back when I open the aged ones, but this smelled too boozy and I was thinking I just wasted $10 before I tasted anything. Anyways, lots of booze. The bourbon is in the front, some bitter chocolate, licorice, a very subtle bit of coffee, and even less vanilla. This is a malt centric smell, again generally overpowered by alcohol. After tasting I went back and appreciated the smell more knowing I wasn't choking this down just because it was so expensive. The bourbon is the main culprit and I suspect after some time this will mellow and just get better.
Taste: Ok so I was so happy this tasted to good. It's rich. So rich. I'm getting the same stuff as I smelled with the bourbon and alcohol way more in the back where they belong. The malts are up front with just enough hops to keep things somewhat balance without really making too much of a statement. There is a rich sweetness here. Not overpowering or obnoxious. Just beautiful. 
Mouthfeel: A little thinner than I would like. It's wonderfully viscous sticking to my tongue, teeth and anything I spill it onto. Carbonation is adequate, and the alcohol isn't terribly spicy even though it is not aged. 
Drinkability: I took a couple of hours to finish this bomber, and I took my time on purpose because the 11% definitely lets you know. I'd say for stouts this is very drinkable just because it is so good. I thought it was expensive when I bought 6, but after tasting how good it is, I'm going to pick up some more for aging. This beer lives up to the hype. Try it if you can. 1,888 characterswebsherpa, Jan 22, 2011
4.7/5  rDev +4.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Tried saving this one, but the anticipation got the best of me...
A - Pours jet black into my tulip glass with about one finger of tan head that dissipates slowly into a tan ring around the glass and displays nice lacing.
S - Lots of dark roasted malts, caramelized sugar, molasses, and coffee notes are primary. Vanilla, oak, and bourbon notes are secondary with just a touch of alcohol.
T - Surprisingly sweet, but not in an overwhelming or bad way. Roasted malts, more of a sweet chocolate than the bittersweet, espresso, molasses and anise are all present. As it mellows on the palate more of the vanilla and oak/bourbon notes come out along with a little heat.
M - Smooth and creamy, full bodied and really well balanced.
D - Very drinkable, and just an overall really great beer. I wish this was more readily available because it is something special. Hope I can get my hands on a few more to let age and see what else this brew can develop. 952 charactersStoneBrewFanatic, Jan 21, 2011
4.83/5  rDev +7.8%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5After years of label rejections, this beer finally made it into the Texas market! Like a proper strong stout, this stuff looks like the center of a black hole. Light struggles in vain to penetrate. Definitely one of the darkest beers I have had to date. About a fingers worth of dark khaki head tops things off. The head falls to a ring, and leaves plenty of lacing down the glass.
Onto the aroma. Abyss smells deep and dark. Plenty of dark roasted malts. Dark chocolate hits first. Underlying notes of dark roasted coffee strike next. Plenty of molasses comes through. Some light licorice notes as well. Some oak and alcohol spice rounds out the nose. Quite impressive, yet not over the top.
The taste is no less impressive. This is quite the sweet stout. Plenty of sweet chocolate syrup notes. Espresso notes abound as well. The molasses and licorice notes in the nose are much stronger on the palate. The alcohol provides a light pepperiness and warmth. The finish is quite sweet with a bit of warmth. Bourbon and oak linger on in the drawn out finish.
The abyss is as full bodied as they come. Smooth and velvety on the tongue. The carbonation just barely cuts through the denseness.
The long wait for this brew was beyond worth it. Of all the the ultra-hyped brews I have had, this one beyond lives up to said hype. Abyss is dangerously drinkable. The alcohol is smooth, just standing out enough to let you know this is a strong beer. I have drank many memorable beers over the year. This one though may be at the top of the list. Thank you Deschutes for creating this nectar of the gods. 1,597 charactersSweasty, Jan 21, 2011

This was an amazing beer to pour - the black liquid inside the bottle poured in a smooth black velvet rope of oil. I was left with a very minimal dark coffee head. The head and lacing suffered since we were sharing this between 3 or 4 people.
The aroma is built upon layers of soft vanilla oakiness mixed with sweet chocolate brownies and very light bourbon heat and astringency. The barreling are interwoven exceptionally in this brew. Light roasted milk coffee adds additional depth and richness.
This is one of the smoothest drinking stouts I have ever crossed. Lots of nice espresso and dark roast coffee, but it's not burnt like some beers can taste. The malts are deep and luscious. Mild vanilla from the barrel mixes with sweet black chocolate and anise. I was actually hoping to get a lot more licorice flavor from this to be honest. Bourbon is present but very subdued - just enough to add richness to the brew. 
Again, this is a very smooth beer. Light on carbonation, but that is only appropriate for a thick stout like this one. It wasn't hot at all for me despite the 11% abv.
I found The Abyss to be extremely drinkable, nay, craveable. It's one of the more deep and complex stouts out there. Is it the best American Imperial Stout on the market? Hard to say. But I think it is worthy of its praise and certainly worth seeking out.
Thanks again Seth, a real treat! 1,455 charactersSpider889, Jan 20, 2011

A little less than a finger of sudsy medium brown head. Black body tinging towards cherry cola at the top. Pretty good lacing after a fairly quickly receding head. Some nice islands of head floating around in this dark sea. Roasted coffee, licorice, sweet malt, light chocolate, alcohol are all present on the nose. A little bit of oaked bourbon but not overpowering in any way. Tastes very licorice-like, vanilla from the barrels, toasty roasty coffee, pretty bitter finish, but in a burnt way, rather than a hop way. Mouthfeel is perfect. Heavy. Creamy. Just perfect. Finishes nice and dry. Dangerous drinkability for 11+. Outstanding. 758 charactersWestValleyIPA, Jan 20, 2011

Pours a tremendously jet black coloring, with a dark brown, foamy head that dissipates as you drink. The beer smells of coffee, molasses, and dark chocolate. The beer has initial flavors of coffee and malty alcohol. You absolutely taste the oak barrel and smokey characteristics, also. The alcohol is present and in front throughout experiencing this brew. The finish is a little harsh, and I can only imagine that it smooths out as it ages. Very low level sweet aftertaste, with tastes of caramel and molasses. I look forward to trying this one again in a year or so... 636 charactersGarthDanielson, Jan 20, 2011

I'm hoping and thinking it's not contaminated because I was aging two bottles. When I first heard from my buddy Jeff that they might be tainted I opened the other one a long time ago, just to see if mine were among the bunk ones. The other one still tasted excellent so here we go.
Poured from a bomber into a snifter 
A beautiful looking brew. Thick, black, plenty of head that looks like frothy hot chocolate. Mmmmm, delicious looking. Good head retention while waiting for it to warm just a bit. (the garage was a bit colder than proper serving temp) 
Uh-oh. Nose seems way off, getting a slight metallic smell or something that shouldn't be there. Maybe im just trippin because I'm nervous. 
Ahhh damn it, this sucks. It's totally infected. Man, a year's worth of aging wasted. I should have listened to everyone's advice on BA and drank them all the minute I knew this was even a possibility. Anyways, at least I have a 2010 Release to open and comfort me. I'll review the 2010 and hit re-review later but right now I'm mad at both myself and Deschutes quality control lab for wasting my time and precious money. This 2009 is an F - literally "avoid". For anyone else out there that still has one in the cellar, hurry and drink it now to at least catch a buzz for your thirteen bucks because I think it's only getting worse with age. Mine's already pretty tough to even drink.

Appearance is pitch black with a big three finger tan head. Smell is roasted dark chocolate with a slight hint of bourbon and oak.
Taste is stunning. Many complex flavors exploding out of this beer including roasted malt, oak, and dark chocolate. Bourbon is also present, teasing me to wish there was more but then again I'm glad there isn't otherwise it would be overpowering and would take away from the great RIS base.
But what makes this beer truly great is the smoothness ... and this is the 2010 version. I can't wait to put some age on this beer and try it again in the future.
This is now the standard which I hold all RIS. 728 charactersshir0043, Jan 18, 2011

S: Lots of chocolate and roasted malt. Just one whiff of this and I knew it was a good bottle. Some smoke makes it's way into the mix as well
T: Very much like the nose. Layers of chocolate and roasted malt are joined with a touch of vanilla to result in a silky smooth beer. There is a charred/smokey flavor hidden in the background. Also just a slight dark fruit/cherry flavor (could be the molasses)
M: Full bodied. Silky smooth beer. Nice roasted finish. Just perfect for an imperial stout
D: Off the top of my head, the best imperial stout I've ever had. The flavors combine well and create wonderful balance. I see why this is so highly regarded 890 charactersBrez07, Jan 18, 2011
4.25/5  rDev -5.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Served on tap into a pint glass, this poured an opaque black color with a scant tan head that quickly dissipated leaving little or no lacing on the glass. The smell was faintly of toffee and chocolate. The taste was intense, with notes of toffee, chocolate, caramel, and coffee. Not much in the way of hops was tasted, but with all the other flavors they weren't missed. The mouthfeel is suitably rich. This is an intensely flavored high alcohol beer, so one is enough, especially when the bartender poured this into a pint glass. I'm not complaining. It was an excellent way to finish the evening. This is a very nice brew. 624 charactersedbeered, Jan 18, 2011

A - Pours as black as night in a cave. Beautiful inkiness to it that just seems different than any other beer. Half finger mocha brown head, similar hued lacing
S - Incredible smell. An assault that included perfectly roasted chocolate and coffee, an oaky vanilla, molasses, black licorice. Couldn't pick up anise but did pick up some old pipe tobacco. 
M - Silky smooth, creamy and heavy as hell. A slight touch of heat from the bourbon but very minor.
D - The quintessential sipper. Absolutely perfectly balanced and a gem. 574 charactersOakedCanuck, Jan 17, 2011

A - Incredibly dark black -- so dark I can almost see the space-time bending around it. All joking aside, this is up there with the darkest beers I've ever seen. One finger of creamy, foamy tan head.
S - Surprisingly sweet, a lot of the molasses and hints of bourbon coming through. Not all that much of the roasted profile.
T - Sweet malt attacks the palate, quickly followed by cocoa and dark fruits, rounded out by a strong roasted coffee flavor near the finish. A bit dry on the finish, but quite pleasant.
M - Full-bodied and sticky, not quite at syrupy levels, but close. The alcohol warms the throat and stomach, but is more comfortable than may be expecting considering the high ABV.
D - This beer really was everything I expected it to be, and more. Despite the heaviness and high alcohol, this beer is pleasant on the senses and quite drinkable. A completely different beast than other American Imperial Stouts (e.g., Stone RIS or Old Rasputin), entirely in a category of its own. 1,057 charactersNefariousR, Jan 17, 2011

A: Dark black with a dark brown head that doesn't last too long. Decent lacing.
S: Lots of dark roasted malt, bittersweet chocolate, a bit of coffee, dark fruits, some oakiness and just a hint of bourbon. There is a bit of black licorice that I'm not too found of, other than that, it smells awesome and very complex. 
T: Layers and layers of flavors. So much going on. It follows the nose pretty closely, but I do pick up more licorice that I'm not digging so much. First you pick up some semi sweet roasted malt, dark bittersweet chocolate and just a hint of bourbon. Next comes some woody flavors, more roasty malts and some of that licorice. Near the end the hops come forward to provide a nice change of pace to the flavors and provide a great balance. Nice long roasted and semi-sweet and bitter finish.
M: Fuller body. Low carbonation, smooth. A bit viscous.
D: Good drinkability. Its 11%, doesn't taste quite that high, but you know its high abv. Some age will do this one nicely. Will review again after the 11/15/11 best after date. 1,083 charactersherman77, Jan 16, 2011
4.75/5  rDev +6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Ah Deschutes. This brewery is making some killer beers. I really love their stouts and the Abyss is no exception. I have had multiple bottles of this beer and even got lucky enough to have it on draft as well. This beer though seems to be just as good in the bottle. The bottle might even be a little better because the bottle's tip is dipped in a dark wax making it all that more alluring. 
Now on with the review. Once you finally make it through the wax to pop this baby open and start pouring you can see and smell what all that effort was for. This beer is dark as in real dark. The head that forms is even dark and looks like a coffee with a lot of cream added. This is one of those beers that gets a nice cascade action happening in the head making another noteworthy attribute to an already cool beer. Now you must wait just a little longer the head that forms is not going to be leaving anytime soon. I know I know all that work of breaking though the wax then you pour it out and you still can't drink it. Its worth the wait and you can at least enjoy the aroma. This beer smells great. It has that alcoholic chocolate smell to it. 
First sip! OK finally time to take that first sip and man is this thing good. The flavor is very complex and has a lot of character. So the initial flavor is kind of smoky with a hint of bittersweet chocolate. This beer tends to activate my entire mouth with the majority of the taste and feeling happening on the back of my tongue and back of my nose. The overall mouth feel is nice and thick. This beer is definitely a flavor changer. As you progress though the glass you start to loose some of the initial flavors and start picking up others. 
So in conclusion I really really like this beer. This is one of those really neat beers that will just get better over time. If you get a 22 better pick up two of them. One to drink now and one to put in the dark to age. Yup says right on the label that this magical witches brew will sit just fine in the bottle for some aging. The Abyss is a great beer and if you like dark complex beers then this is the one for you. My local price here in San Diego is $13.99 for a 22oz bottle. 2,174 charactersbroken22, Jan 16, 2011
4.42/5  rDev -1.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Haven't reviewed in a while. This annual seems worth it.
2010 Reserve.
If I hadn't had this beer before I would be worried about the immediate fumes of oak that hit the nose. Clearly this is a big part of the profile but even on the nose this bite is calmed a bit with milky chocolate and anise. Thus despite the grainy, boozey implications it's plain to see (and smell) that something deeper is about to happen here.
Visually this might be short of a feast, but it's definitely no joke to look at in the glass. Huge lacing from a layered, creamy head is there to stay. Not the thickest stout but bold and dark regardless.
Tastewise, as I've hinted, the flavors here (even in this fresh bottle) are nothing short of perfect balance. This is not a gimmick beer that whallops you with weasel dung espresso or the "vanillins" of an oak barrel. What I sense here is an expert craft with no aversion to the generalities of a much-attempted style. In the best of cases, this pragmatic approach reveals an archetype of flavor, a prototype of recipe. Abyss is one of these. Accessible, but perfectly executed.
It's hard to find a flaw with this beer on its own. Compared to other mega stouts it's admittedly not my favorite (see: Parabola, BCBS), which is perhaps due to its reserved sweetness in favor of earth and oak. Hope to try this aged some day. Good job, Deschutes. 1,370 charactersbohemiandonut, Jan 16, 2011

Smells of bourbon, licorice, spices, bakers chocolate.
Taste of bittersweet chocolate, coffee and licorice up front, with bourbon and raisin notes. Quite complex! 
Mouthfeel is thick and chewy. Mouth and stomach is warmed by prevalent alcohol. Fantastic!
An ideal sippin' Imperial Stout -- one to savor. Even in its youthful state, it's amazing. I will have to find some to age. I very much enjoyed traveling into the Abyss. Hats off to you, Deschutes! 633 characterspisomojado8, Jan 16, 2011

A - pours a dark abyss-like black with a ½ finger chocolate-tan head
S - charred oak and molasses pop the most, with layers of vanilla and burnt malts hidden beneath. The sweet spiciness of the black licorice is also very prominent.
T - Huge flavor going on. Chocolate malts appear first on the palate. This fades to an oaky molasses that is shrouded in a cloud of coffee and burnt malt. A touch of vanilla fades to very bitter dark chocolates that dominate the finish with subtle hints of charred oak/smokiness and citrusy hops. The licorice makes itself known on the exhale, mixed with a some chocolaty coffee. Awesome stuff here - 
M - a little watery and chewy on this medium bodied brew. Wait, this is 11%, you could have easily fooled me
D - Fantastic brew here. Very deep, dark, complex flavors on the nose and palate. This one easily ranks up there with the best of them. This beer seems to a very well balanced hybrid between a huge RIS (lots of chocolate and burnt coffee) and a huge BA RIS (molasses, charred oak, and vanilla), both sides competing on the palate, but neither winning the battle. Fantastic, can't wait to see what some age does this beauty. 1,185 charactersbirchstick, Jan 15, 2011

The Abyss pours a deep oil black color with a lot of viscosity to the pour. A nice tan to brown head sticks throughout. A very nice looking pour. Smells are dominated with coffee, chocolate and bourbon. Very nice smelling. The taste is somewhat hot with the bourbon and alcohol but still delicious. I think this needs another year to sit and to mellow out. Mouthfeel is thick and carbonated. Drinkability is misleading with this brew. It is a huge beer and the entire bomber is just too much for one person in a single session. 613 charactersabrand, Jan 15, 2011
4.45/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5A great beer, perhaps a little overhyped. I had a 2010 vintage, it tastes great but some age will do this some good. 
Pours a thick black color with a great tan head that dies quickly leaving some lacing. Barely any light comes through this beer. 
The smell is probably the best part, almost a 5 from me but not quite. A big aroma with tons of roast complimented by a little of the oak and licorice giving a nice sweetness and savory quality to the beer. A cool smokyness arises from this beer but is smoothed out by some vanilla notes and a sort of candied dark fruit. 
The taste mostly follows the smell but here I get a little espresso and little more spicy licorice. Some lactose sugar is there as well, burnt dark fruit, alcohol heat that is off put a little by the oak and sweetness, and a bittersweet finish showing the hops still somewhat making an impression on this beer. Very Good, but not a 5.
Nice creamy feel that is sort of thrown off a little by the alcohol heat. Though the heat isn't bad, I can see why the label says not the drink the beer until after November 15th of this year. I look forward to trying it then!
Drinkability is still quite good cause it's a tasty brew, and I could still have probably taken down a bomber, though I had help from friends this time. I may come back and throw in another rating next November when I'm 'supposed' to drink this. 1,383 charactersDreadnaught33, Jan 15, 2011

Appearance: Bottle comes waxed, hard to crack, open and pop. Served in a Sierra snifter, pours a very thick oil-like product, very viscous, completely black with some auburn tones. Specially at the end, it pours like liquid chocolate. I imagine the Gulf of Mexico drenched in The Abyss after Deepwater Horizon. A perfect one-finger head appears after pouring, of a brownish-coffee color, characteristic of an Imperial Stout. This head does not last long and promptly recedes into a thin rim around the glass. Lacing is very notable but not spectacular for the style.
Smell: All of the main ingredients are on display on the complex and rich nose. That licorice, the oak and the wood, some vanilla, the bourbon. This, the bourbon, appears to me as overtly strong, bringing the nose to a certain one-dimensionality (despite the overall complexity). I swear I'm back in Bourbon County, Kentucky! Some dairy as well, chocolate and hot booze.
Taste: Follows nose very closely. Liquorice, vanilla, oak. Then the bourbon and the booze. Roastiness and some burnt sugars, acompanied by very dark, bitter chocolate. At the end of the sip, I feel like I have licked some vinous, extra-strength wooden casks. 
Mouthfeel: Very hot all around. It burns! Chewy, heavy. Super carbonated. Full body and flavor. Finishes extra dry and bitter. Not too pleasant.
Drinkability: Very hard. A sipper from beginning to end. It is overtly boozy from the start, and it never quiets down. The bourbon burns, not so pleasant. I wonder if fresh is more rounded? Or maybe even older, two or three years instead of one... 
As it is, this is something I'm glad I got to try but cannot say is my favorite Imperial Stout. It lacks balance, in my opinion. What I had was a total "bourbon bomb". 1,933 charactersDoubleSimcoe, Jan 15, 2011
4.67/5  rDev +4.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Living close to so many breweries has its advantages...but also its disadvantages. It's easy to get overwhelmed with such a fantastic array of beers, accessible as they are. The result is that when you try a really incredible beer, like the Abyss, you have to remain objective. After several years of production (limited release) I have bottle conditioned (over a year) and have had it on draft. The quality is always perfect, never changing except on bottle conditioning, but that only improves the character, mouthfeel and taste. I rated this beer highly, because as my liver can attest, it has had some competition and remains a highlight of the cold winter months here year after year. The aroma is incredible, and the taste washes over your mouth, saturating it completely with dark molasses and oak. I love this beer. 823 charactersDansrc51, Jan 15, 2011

Dark, deep black beer with a dark brown head. Lasting lace. Tons of lace. Like ice, with each sip the lace builds upon itself. Beautiful looking beer. 
Big and complex. Rich but mellow roast flavors. Exceptionally well done. Dominated by dark roast flavors but with no bitter or burnt flavor. A bit of earthy tones, even berries, and a malt sweetness with hints of caramel/chocolate sweetness comes through as it warms. 
Rich, mellow, and big. I keep returning to that. Very easy to drink for a beer with such big flavors. 
This beer stands out as exceptional beyond other remarkably well done stouts. 619 charactersbirderbeerer, Jan 15, 2011

Originally posted on: 2-21-09
2008 bottle. Have had this one on four separate occasions already, so I am re-rating.
A- Pours black with a pleasantly small brown head.
S- Smell is mostly coffee, chocolate, some dark malts, vanilla/oak, brown sugar and alcohol.
T- It starts off very nicely with a lot of coffee, roasted malts, creamy chocolate, and some licorice and hops. Ends with dark malty bitterness. There is some heat in this beer, but it is calming down with age. 
M- Decent mouthfeel, barely full bodied. Goes down without any issues.
D- Drinkability is slightly hurt down the line due to the heat.
Overall its clear that this is a great beer, and is certainly getting much better with age. Glad I have one left in the cellar.
Edit: 2010 edition review on 1-13-11
A- Pours black with a small solid brown head. Large bubbles mingle with small, tightly knit bubbles. Nice lacing left on the glass from this beer as well. 
S- Right off the bat I get licorice, molasses, sweet brown sugar, and maybe way off in the distance hints of the bourbon barrel.
T- Licorice, barbecue smokiness, molasses, coffee, American citrusy hops (oranges, grapefruit), and a hint of slight burn from the heat and barrel action at the finish. Much better out of the gates than previous years.
M- Lower end of full bodied. As always, my only quip about this beer is it should be a little bit thicker to make it a pure masterpiece. Definitely thicker than 2009, though.
D- Excellent drinkability as always. I hate to finish off each bottle.
Overall, this seems to be a great vintage. Each vintage has been different, but this may be the most cohesive vintage fresh, compared to other years. My favorite vintage is 2008, but hopefully this one can rival it down the road since I have 2 more bottles of this in the cellar and only one more bottle of the 2008. 1,987 charactersTK5150, Jan 13, 2011
4.88/5  rDev +8.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5From notes:
2007 vintage. Pours pitch black and almost completely opaque with only faint mahogany edges when held to a light source and a two finger frothy mocha head. Excellent retention, only slowly fading into a lasting cap that coats the glass with chinks of soapy lacing.
Slightly smokey, roasted malt aroma with lots of luscious, silky chocolate as well as some licorice, subtle oak, vanilla, coffee bean, toast and toffee.
Chewy medium body with an incredibly luscious, silky chocolate malt flavor. Hints of mocha, toast, oatmeal, mocha and toffee as well as some caramel and sweet alcohol. Slightly creamy presence mid-palate makes this beer incredibly smooth and extremely quaffable. Slight bitterness up front is countered by the chocolate malt as well as the oak, bourbon and vanilla notes. The ABV is excellently masked making it dangerously drinkable. Also, the barrel aging adds to the complexity and balance of the beer and instead of it being a complete bourbon bomb it results in an incredibly complex, flavorful and well balanced, amazing beer. 1,065 characterscorby112, Jan 13, 2011
4.58/5  rDev +2.2%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.522oz waxed bottle (2010 vintage) brought to me by a co-worker from Denver. Many thanks to "Long-Toes" for hooking me up with a few bottles!
Note: This review is ONLY for the 2010. I've had the 2009 recently as well, yet didn't find it fair to actually rate the 2009 as it was infected and just horrible. If you're reading this, stay away from the 2009!
A- Nice. Pours jet black with a decent mocha head. Initial head dies down but still remains and leaves awesome lacing.
S- Again, nice. Light roasted malt with a touch of oak and bourbon.
T- Complexity. Roasted and chocolate malts, dry oak, and a touch of bourbon.
M- My wife summed it up best after taking a sip: "silky". Incredibly smooth and creamy with a medium/full body. Don't know how you could make this any better.
D- For an imperial stout this big, it's incredibly high. The rich, diverse flavors and smooth mouthfeel keep me coming back.
Overall - OK, like I stated earlier this review is for a FRESH bottle of the 2010, and it is well deserving of it's lofty praises/rating. Complex flavors, amazingly silky smooth mouthfeel, I could go on and on. I honestly don't see how this will get any better with aging, since it's already fantastic. Go ahead and enjoy it now.
However, the 2009 (infected or not) was a complete trainwreck right out of the gate. Bad barrels, infected, whatever the excuse is, the '09 sucked something awful. Avoid that year like the plague... 1,432 charactersmrandypandy, Jan 13, 2011
4.15/5  rDev -7.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4This was a 2010 bottle shared with my fiance over dinner. Great bottle that pours black with a deep tan head and a bit of stickyness around the sides. I believe wine people call this legs. My nose detects smokeyness brought on by the molasses (I believe), licorics and anise, chocolate roasted notes, and a hint of vanilla and cherry. The flavor is in harmony between deep roasty flavors like chocolate, coffee, and toffee and popping flavors like anise, vanilla, oak and fruity and even some grapey tastes. Thick, luscious, and smooth mouthfeel. The alcohol content in this beer is well hidden, but even at that this is a beer to share. 637 characterspmlondrigan, Jan 13, 2011

What can I say about this beer except that it's the best pure Imperial Stout I have tasted. Pours a thick, deep black with a nice brown frothy head. Smells of chocolate, hints of coffee and the slightest of spice. 
This beer is so smooth, it has a creamy mouthfeel and the perfect bite on the finish. There is really nothing to compare it to because it's so well balanced. It's got the sweet yet sharp taste to it. 
Had it twice on tap, and both times it was exceptional. I can't wait to crack open a bottle. 
Deschutes is an excellent brewery. 594 charactersmoz9, Jan 12, 2011

A: Came out in a big chalice with a soft dark brown lacing across the top. (I wouldn't call it a head). Almost motor oil black and somewhat viscous. 
S: great rich smell with lots of roasty malts, some licorice and a good amount of chocolate. 
T: great taste really full bodied with lots of roasty malty flavors. Just the right amount of licorice and some nice chocolate flavors to it. 
M: good mouthfeel though I generally like my stouts a little thicker, this could have been simply because its young. 
D: its a big beer and drinks very well for it, nice integration of alchohol and is pretty easy to drink but wouldn't want to pound it back. 699 characterspsiweaver, Jan 12, 2011

Appearance: As pitch black as I've seen. A very nice, brown, one finger head with surprising good retention. Very thick pour.
Aroma: Espresso, brown sugar, molasses, and anise all combine to form a really pleasant aroma. There is a nice sweetness, but it avoids being cloying completely. 
Taste: This is seriously smooth and complex. Licorice and molasses are definitely here with brown sugar, coffee and some nice baker's fudge.A touch of oask is also noticable. What I like so much is it manages to stay sweet and smooth, about still has a nice roasty and bitter character. Really remarkable balance.
Mouthfeel: Full bodied and really smooth. Perfect amount of carbonation. 
Drinkability: At 11% ABV, this is still remarkably smooth. Great for sipping. 
Overall, a really great stout with some nice balance. I love the brown sugar/molasses component to the flavor and how well it is integrated without being overpowering. Complex and balanced, with a really strong flavor base. Highly recommended. 1,167 charactersGosox8787, Jan 11, 2011
4.82/5  rDev +7.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.52010 bottle. Shared with my girlfriend in our oversized wine glasses. This was not particularly easy to track down but well worth it. 
Pours deep dark black with nice mocha coloured head that dissipated rather quickly. Left pretty much nothing. 
Smells like heaven in a glass. The bourbon is well masked and mingles well with chocolate and coffee and roasted malts. Everything you could ever want In a stout is here. The oak comes out to play a bit as well. 
The taste is equally as good as the nose. First is the sweet bourbon and chocolate followed by a bit of coffee and hops that gives way to a sweet lingering finish that dances on the tongue until the next wonderful sip. 
Feels medium heavy in the mouth with the perfect amount of carbonation. Sits well and nice warming feeling with every swallow. 
I could sip this all night if I had more. Alas this was the only bottle I could procure. I love this beer. Must find more. Holy damn. 945 charactersbootlegger1929, Jan 11, 2011

A: Pours an oily, dark, thick blackness with 2 1/2 fingers of milk chocolate head. Abundant and thick lacing up and down the glass.
S: Rich coffee, roasted malts, chocolate, and subtle smokey vanilla on the end. 
T: Warming bourbon taste. Bitter chocolates, coffee, and a roasty finish. This one could use a little time to subdue the heat, but delicious nonetheless. 
M: Thick and creamy. Moderate carbonation. Couldn't ask for a better feel for this one.
D: Have had this one a few times during various tasting. Finally had a full bottle to review. Very smooth, but a little hot to call this one highly drinkable. Would love to try a vertical of this one. 722 characterskirkpjr, Jan 10, 2011
4.68/5  rDev +4.5%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5I thought this beer was amazing. After having the oak aged yetti that everyone raves about i thought this was far and away a better beer. the drinkability was hands down better and the flavor was more apparent. I thought that the 11% felt more like an 6 or 7% because of the abundant flavor hiding the alcohol. Nothing about this beer was too harsh yet it remained a full body Imperial stout.. in my opinion it was a perfected stout. I live in oregon and get to drink deschuttes beers all the time and none of them are this good. their porter is great but waiting all year for this beer is well worth it. in my town you can get it whenever you want on tap. Only thing i have to say about this beer that i didn't like was the 14 bucks it cost out of the bottle when i can get it on tap for 5. I have always been a stout drinker and in my opinion this one wins every award... best of the best. Chocolate/coffee with licorice finish... and molasses all over... amazing.. 967 charactersthomasben86, Jan 10, 2011

Aroma is chock full of great stuff: chocolate, roast, char, molasses, anise and tobacco. Very complex flavor profile. Nice black licorice/roasted malt bitterness combo. Char is pretty big. Baker's chocolate. And dark fruits...plums, black cherry, etc... I really like the anise oil/licorice/molasses characteristic in the flavor that lingers long after. Body is medium or so. Carbonation is prickly, but light. Nice. Very good beer. 505 charactersBighuge, Jan 10, 2011
4.68/5  rDev +4.5%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 52010 Abyss on nito-tap.
Beer is black at the bottom of the glass, though as it gets closer to the head it does give some faint brown highlights. The carbonation adds some tan rising bubbles.The head is a brown fluffy cloud sitting atop the the beer. It leaves beautiful lacing that leaves a thing foamy cover of the entire side of the glass. There are thicker rings of foam lacing that show where each sip was finished. Gorgeous.
The aroma gives smooth notes of roasty malts, cocoa, espresso and molasses. The anise notes are there, though only as a faint back note.
The taste follows the nose, with an emphasis on the sweeter chocolate and espresso aspects of the beer. It gives way to more of the black licorice anise and a lightly boozy bourbon note in the finish.
The mouthfeel really blew me out of the water. Amazingly thick, full bodied and creamy smooth. The first thing I said in regards to the mouth feel was that it was like a beer milkshake. Now with all that said, it in no ways becomes heavy on the palate. It actually gives a wonderful fluffy airiness. Hard to describe.
I wish I could score the mouthfeel higher.
This beer is easily one of the most enjoyable and drinkable beers I have had. One word to describe the aroma, taste and mouthfeel? Smooth. Incredibly well balanced flavors, and an out of this world mouthfeel. Also it completely hides 11% ABV which really just makes it dangerously drinkable. 1,425 charactersvkv822, Jan 08, 2011

Truth - I cracked this open too early. Wife stated tonight that it's time to start "thinking about having little ones". So in celebration of striving for parenthood...I grabbed 1 of "The Abyss" out of the cellar and chuckled.
Poured into a snifter in a quiet, relaxed, "man cave"...no noise...no distractions...pure silence as I contemplated the near future. A thick black impossible to see through ale, with a 1/2' thick, delightfully inviting chocolate mousse' like head. Smells of sweet bourbon (of which i'm a huge fan), licorice is present...alcohol just "subtly stings" the nasals as I sigh.
With the 1st deep sip...I am gone. Silky, smooth, a bit of a bourbon hang that dissipates within a couple seconds. The second sip...heaven or hell (whichever you prefer). A warmth consumes me. The bourbon makes it's presence known. 
Easily consumable, a treat, one to relish & savor. There is no need to repeat the praise of this flavored ale. I do promise that I will not enjoy the next alone...for this is to be shared & celebrated. 
I only ask for strength not to pre-emptively crack the precious few I have left, but it leaves me with a mission to hunt this down and cellar as many as I can. Good hunting my friends. 1,236 characterskytashie, Jan 08, 2011

S-chocolate and mollases,black licorice. I can smell subtle amounts of Oak and bourbon, the oak is more distinct. Light malt smell after all that 
T-I have had this beer numerious times and it never ceises to amaze me how good it is. Chocolate licorice. A bit of sweetness that is balanced out nicely the malts. There is a nice amount of oak and bourbon in the finish.
M-this is my favorite part, for such a big beer, this is silky smooth, small amount of carbination as it gets a little dryer in the finnish.
Time after time, this beer always stands out, I will look forward to the next time. 715 charactersGradyS1, Jan 08, 2011
4.42/5  rDev -1.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 42010 Vintage. Dark black color with a slightly higher viscosity than most other beers. A small head forms and slowly settles to a thin film. Moderate amount of spotty lacing is left on the glass.
This beer has an impressive aroma. Dark chocolate, roasted malt, licorice, vanilla, and some barrel-age oak. Alcohol is detected and adds nicely to the aroma.
Deeply roasted flavor. Hints of chocolate and licorice. Just slightly smokey. Slight yeast esters. The alcohol definately adds to the flavor without being overly boozy or hot. Reminds me of Expedition Stout with a few years on it. Do not get much from the barrel-aging.
Thick and chewy body. Wonderful smooth texture. About as good as a stout could get.
The one major fault of this beer is that the label says part of the beer was aged in Bourbon barrels. Absoulutely no sign of it in the aroma or flavor. If I could of tasted it, this would of been a perfect 5 in flavor. Drinking great now, no need to age this fine stout. 983 charactersmorimech, Jan 07, 2011

Appearance: Dark, dark and dark. Nice dirty 1/2 inch head on it. 
Smell: Sweetness of molasses comes straight out. 
Taste & Mouthfeel: Must have got lucky because this isn't an infected one. A slight bit of licorice flavor bubbles up, then the sweetness of the molasses hits you. Slight alcohol tingle rises up and tingles the mouth till the end.

A - Pours black with inch or so kahki head that eventually dies into a nice foam ring. Lacing retention is very good on this one. 
S - Smell is of chocolate and roast, vanilla and earthy hops. Little bits of caramel and brown sugar.
T - Roast and light chocolate. Coffee flavor is throughout and leaves a bittering coffee dryness. I'd like to say that this had a bit more flavor but all I'm really tasting is huge coffee roast flavors. 
M - Creamy and well carbonated. The taste leaves a bittering, dry mouthfeel but its pretty nice for a stout. 
D - This is a very nice sipper and a great after dinner dessert drink. Although I was expecting more flavors that I've had in so many other stouts, this is a huge coffee heavy stout. This is pretty good considering the only other Abyss I've had was an infected 2009 but this isn't bad. 988 charactersjoshuaseresse, Jan 06, 2011

I had it on tap following a Goose Island Bourbon County Stout the other day and thought it was good but a little rough around the edges still. This bottled version is different or maybe I just didn't finish the sweet GI BCS right before drinking it. Whatever the case...top notch..
A-Call it black with a creamy chocolate brown head on top.
S-Very rich...has some doppelbock like characteristics....sweet molasses, brown sugar...some dark fruits...light cocoa...light woody notes but not much bourbon at all
T-Succulent....just a richly flavored stout with great flavors of dark malts, molasses and brown sugar, light cocoa, some dark fruits, and a very light woody note....a slight bakers chocolate/ alcohol presence emerges on the finish. Splendid
M-Can't build an IMPY any better than this. Velvet like texture...immense...rich...fantastic.
D-The other day I had this and I told Big Hugey that I thought Darkness was better. I don't think so anymore. It's splitting hairs but if I had to pick one I think I would go with this. Incredible beer and reasonable priced too. If it was more available I would drink the shit out of this. 1,162 charactersZAP, Jan 06, 2011
4.65/5  rDev +3.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 52010 Bottle:
Not going to follow regular format for this one. I'll just say, for a beer this fresh or young, I've never ever had a Imperial Stout taste this balanced and smooth while holding such flavor complexity. As if it's already been cellared for a year in comparison to most all others of the style.
Most of this style are still pretty hot at this age and the drinkability, mouthfeel, carbonation, silky smoothness of the Abyss right now is spot on. True craftsmanship 2010 vintage.
The taste will easily warrant a 5 after 8 months or so. Chocolate dominates moreso than I remember from the last 2 years. Inbetween dark and milky chocolate. Liquorice, molasses, a wee bit of expresso and mild hints of bourbon swirl together on the palate and the mouthfeel is silky and damn near perfect. Mouthfeel will be PERFECT with age. A mild smokiness can also be detected as well as bits of Oak and Vanilla. Crafting all these characteristics together is 2nd to none. Less carbonated than past vintages but I felt 2009 (uninfected of course) to be just a tad bit overcarbonated.
Final Thoughts - This beer is damn near Stout perfection now. Again, it tastes like it already has aged some! 2008 BCS is the only other I'd argue drinking better right now although I understand they're not quite crafted the same way.
This 2010 vintage will be a measuring stick for all others with some good age on it I'd assume. Very impressed.

4.2/5  rDev -6.3%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.522 oz. bottle (2010 vintage) poured into a tulip glass.
Appearance-Jet black, totally opaque. Generous brown head stand with moderate retention and some lacing.
Aroma-Mmmm, roasty with dark, bittersweet chocolate and coffee notes. Some sour cherry notes, oak, and light vanilla aromas as well. Slight smoky bourbon. Complex, multi-faceted, and delicious.
Flavor-The first flavor I get is a sweet, tart oaky cherry flavor, which is prominent and muted at the same time (I don't really understand myself). This is then overtaken by rich, chocolate milkshake and roasted coffee. The roasted flavors grow in the finish. The tart and oaky flavors return in the finish to eventually be overtaken by roasted coffee and alcohol flavors, which carry far into the aftertaste. As it warms, bourbon and molasses flavors become more prominent.
Mouthfeel-Full, somewhat chewy body. Medium low carbonation. Feels silky smooth and somewhat mouthcoating. Finishes a little bit tart and with some substantial alcohol warmth, but is not astringent, and is not harsh or hot.
Definitely good, though with it this fresh, I can definitely see this one improving with age (It's even dated as "Best After 11/15/11", but I figured since I had 2 I'd try one now and one in a year or two). The flavors need a bit of time to integrate, the body could slim down a hair, and the alcohol, while not hot, could be a little smoother. 1,404 charactersplfahey, Jan 03, 2011
4.72/5  rDev +5.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Split an uninfected 2009 bottle with my roommate in Austin. Got the bottle from Lucas Liquors in Lone Tree CO. You guys rock. Drank it from a Great Divide balloon glass.
I've never had a waxed bottle before. That was interesting and impressive. The label is comparatively simple, but the bottle is quite impressive. Helps out the score. The pour itself doesn't disappoint. Fluffy tan head. Leaves excellent lacing. A truly black beer... but still not the most ominous RIS I've seen. Excellent, but not perfect.
The nose is big and complex. This seems to keep it's nose much longer than other beers I've tried. The base of the nose is chocolate. Big, bad chocolate. Underneath, it's not hard to detect the claimed licorice and molasses. Occasionally, the burbon barrels come through. There is also a bit of boozy heat. A great nose with unique lasting power.
The taste of the beer goes right along with the nose. Lots of standard RIS tastes, but with extra accents. The bourbon and oak might be a bit more hidden than I would like. My roommate didn't pick up on them until after I told him to look for them. The mouthfeel is almost too smooth for a RIS. I want a syurpy, coating feel sometimes! However, The carbonation isn't unwelcome and helps make this astoundingly drinkable. The booze is also highly present, but not unwelcome, either. A new sensation for me with beers.
An uninfected and aged 2009 Abyss is a very, very good beer. I would not mind having one of these to split every single night... 1,507 charactersUTCengOwl, Jan 03, 2011

A - Pours a viscous black with a deep brown head. Bubbles leave pretty quickly. Some stick on the glass
S - Roasty and chocolatey up front. Some oak and slight bourbon though very faint. A hint of alcohol as well.
T - Sweet dark malts, chocolate and roasty. Pretty sweet in the back, almost fruity sweet, maybe cherry. It actually clings to your tonuge. The more I drink the more the wood and oak come out. A very earthy bourbon, not over the top. 
M - Nice low carb, very sticky and viscous.
D - A very easy beer to drink especially at 11%. Though this comes off very sweet at first the flavors are so nice and complex you keep looking for more.
A great beer for sure. Complex with the roast and chocolate blending with the wood and bourbon. 761 charactersboomer31, Jan 02, 2011

A fresh 2010 bottle poured into a snifter. Beer is as black as a stout can be, with just a small amount of dark brown large bubbled head. Lots of alcohol clinging to the glass when swirled, and just a hint of carbonation bubble right at the edge of the glass every now and then.
Nose is nice complex, coffee, dark fruits, dark chocolate, slight bitterness from roasted malts, a hint of vanilla and licorice. 
Drinking this before the suggested drink by date because of other comments about the 2010 release drinking very nicely right now and it doesn't disappoint. Alcohol presence is definitely there, but just a nice mixture of coffee, fruitiness, chocolate, and oak upfront. The finish is long and lush, bourbon presence definitely making its presence in vanilla, caramel, and chocolate staying on your tongue minutes after swallowing. 
Full bodied and perfectly carbonated beer, rich and creamy but not overwhelming in its delivery of flavor. Lasting finish makes this a sip and savor, a beer to spend a long night with, to enjoy its complex and deep flavor. Need more bottles of the 2010 to hang onto and see how it develops over the years. 1,298 charactersnataku00, Jan 02, 2011

Snagged a bottle in a beer trade a couple years ago, cellared it and decided that today was the day. 2008 Release. Pours jet black with a golden highlight shimmering at the top. The brew pours with a thick chocolate colored frothy head like a Wendy's Frosty, do I need a spoon? Aroma is beautiful, chocolate, espresso, marshmallow, caramelized sugars, a little oak and hint of citrus. This beer is thick as hell and velvety smooth. Like a milkshake! The first pour out of the bottle gives me a glass of beer with some serious legs but the head mellows when I pour the second half of the bottle. ABV is a bit numbing and the palate is slick. This beer is incredibly smooth and drinkable yet incredibly complex. It starts of sweet, chocolaty, full of licorice, molasses and roasted malts. As it warms and I continue to sip, more espresso, roasted flavors, hop bitterness, oak and alcohol come through. There is a really nice overlaying touch of bourbon in this beer but not enough to overpower the malt and hops, really balanced perfectly! The beer has maintained a nice roasty, bitter finish over the past three years. My palate is left incredibly numb and dry after each sip. I can't imagine what a fresh bottle must be like. This is really a great beer, delicious! I'd like to try more of Deschutes beers.

Taste is like it smells, thick, but amazingly drinkable for 11%. Every sip was some how better then the previous. Having this beer in my hand for the start of 2011, will always be remembered. I'm glad my wife got me two. 468 charactersSawDog505, Jan 01, 2011

4.5/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Have some vintages of this beer, 08-10. Popped the 2010 this year while in Chandler, AZ. Wanted to try it fresh, for comparison later. 
Poured from a wax sealed 22oz into a large snifter glass.
Pours like black, used motor oil, with a rusty copper head, rises a little less than an inch. Lasts for a bit, then fades to this creamy head that retains, and sticks to the glass a bit
Aromas are of chocolate, roasted malt, vanilla, bourbon, smoked wood, and sweet espresso.
Flavor, much of the same, Chocolate, sweet roasted malt, Caramel, vanilla, smoked wood. Some heat, it's 11%, but for this fresh, it's incredibly complex, even this young. 
The mouth feel is creamy, buttery, and a great sipper. 
Was a great beer to ring in the new year with, and I am looking forward to trying the aged vintages soon. 
What else can be said, you can get lost in this beer. Buy a warehouse, and start filling it with this beer. 919 charactersRetsinis, Jan 01, 2011
4.83/5  rDev +7.8%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Poured from 22 oz. black bottle to Oversized Wine glass. 2010 reserve with best after date of 11-15-11 on bottle. I should wait on it, but I've never had this beer before and can't wait that long to try it. $11.99 a bottle.
Appearance: Deep dark black with a large dark brown creamy head. Decent retention. Great lacing.
Smell: Bourbon, coffee, molasses, dark fruit and chocolate notes in the nose. Slight woody aroma.
Taste: Starts sweet and ends with bitter chocolate/roasted coffee. Alcohol is barely noticeable, but it's there. Leaves a lasting roasted bitterness on the palate that is just heaven.
Mouthfeel: Mouthfeel is smooth and full as full can be with a decent amount of carbonation.
Drinkability: High
I can definitely see why this beer would become better with age, and I can't wait to try it again down the road. An amazing Imperial Stout that truly lives up to it's reputation.

2015 review:
Pours black with some dark brown on the edges. If poured aggressively the head can be enormous.  I always find it funny when people say how many fingers of head they got when they pour like its any reliable indicature because it's all relative to the glass, the temperature of the beer, and how you pour the beer. Anyways. The head sticks around for a little bit but it's a big beer so expected. 
Smells include burnt malt, brown sugar, earthy hops, slight barrel but hard to distinguish, some booze (perhaps a little too fresh), slight dark fruit like a fig. I see this one is aged 50 percent in barrels as opposed to other recent variations which were more around 30. Interestingly I don't get any more barrel character. It is a pretty bitter beer at this point. The roasted character is making this a dry bitter supper with an underlying sweetness.
Mouth feel is smooth and medium to full.
I always love this beer aged and I think that this one will be no exception. I can see the heat dying down a little bit the dark fruits and some of the barrel coming through a little bit more over time. Right now I have to say this beer is very good, but after some time I could see it being a world class beer. 2,133 charactersmellowmark, Jan 01, 2011
4.46/5  rDev -0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5One of the beers included in the 2010 Christmas tasting with my brother (Mississipping) and our dad. Poured from a 2009 bottle--thankfully not infected--into a Bruery snifter.
Appearance:
Black as night. Head was a carmel tan/brown. Originally about one finger think that slowly dissipated into a thing ring with large bubble clusters. 
Smell:
Very strong bourbon scent with hints of caramel and chocolate. There was also a strong smoke smell, but overall not very dynamic and a little disappointing.
Taste:
Not disappointing at all! Bourbon hits the palat first and is quickly followed by a smoky flavor. As it lingers in your mouth and hits the back of your throat the taste changes dramatically. First you begin to notice a chocolate flavor that is bold and stays with you for a long time. Then you begin to notice a licorice flavor and is finished by a toffee flavor that lingers for minutes. As it warms there is a strong coffee flavor that begins to show up more and more. It is very hidden at first, but will almost become overpowering if warm. The alcohol is very well masked and almost unnoticeable. 
Mouthfeel:
Full-bodied. Very smooth and lingers for hours. Not too thick, but coats the whole mouth which allows you to notice the changing of all the flavors. Very drying at the end.
Drinkability:
A very slow drinker and definitely a sipper. Our bottle, split 3 ways, lasted between 45 minutes and an hour. The flavors keep you coming back for more and also make you want to take your time to enjoy the complexity of the beer. 1,547 charactersStayWhatYouAre2, Dec 31, 2010
3.22/5  rDev -28.1%look: 5 | smell: 3 | taste: 3 | feel: 4 |  overall: 32010 fresh
A: A dark black, viscous looking beer. Pours with an impressive, frothy mocha head that dissipates very slowly. Tons of lacing. 
S: Light roasted malts. Notes of vanilla and hints of chocolate. Sweet burnt toast. 
T: Big bitter coffee/espresso with dark chocolate. A little harsh. Vanilla and bourbons hints. Dark burnt sugar is occasionally apparent. 
M: Thick, with some velvety carbonation. 
D: The thickness and harsh flavors bring the drinkability down, but for all it's complexities it is pretty drinkable. 
Notes: Honestly, I was a little disappointed with this beer. I'm a big fan of big stouts, so I expected to be a big fan of this beer. However, the flavors seemed a little harsh in the wrong places. I have another bottle, and will give this beer another chance after a year of aging. 813 charactersuberkane, Dec 31, 2010
4.26/5  rDev -4.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.522oz bomber, 2009 edition, thankfully uninfected and split with a friend. My half went into my Duvel tulip.
I swear the lights dimmed as I poured this beer, its darkness is that intense. Three inches of rich caramel foam cap the beer, and while lacing is good, the head fades away a bit quickly. Aside from the requisite slab of dark chocolate, the only other flavor to shine through in the nose is a faint, but distinct spiciness. It almost reminds me of a less intense version of the recent Stone IRS 10th Anniversary Greg Koch blend. There's a bit more to this beer though, as my tasting notes have the various flavors at play as (in order of intensity) dark chocolate, espresso, spice, and licorice. I can only guess the spiciness is from the hops, and it's remarkable that there is this much presence left this late in the ballgame. I'm pleased to see that licorice is deployed as an ancillary flavor, as I'm not a big fan of it in heavy doses. The mouthfeel is spot on, incredibly rich body without becoming syrupy, thanks to the support of a subdued but effective level of carbonation. I'm thrilled my first bottle of Abyss was devoid of infection, and while I hope the same is true of my other '09, it's probably a good idea to stock up on some '10, becasuee this is a hell of a beer. 1,293 charactersaxeman9182, Dec 31, 2010
4.38/5  rDev -2.2%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 42010 bottle
A - Pitch black. There's no light shining through. Dark brown rocky head. There is a decent amount of lacing.
S - Smells a bit like worcestershire sauce at first. Dark roasted coffee notes coupled with caramel sweetness. The alcohol comes through towards the finish. 
T - Sweet caramel and coffee upfront. There is a nice sweet nutty character in the middle of the taste. It then finishes with a molasses taste and a nice alcohol warmth.
M - Full bodied, smooth and silky. Carbonation is a little light. Still..it coates the palate gently and nicely.
D - I find it hard to stop sipping this beer. It's deliciously drinkable. With an ABV at 11% I would be drunk pretty fast if i had plenty of this.
Notes - I will cellar the other bottle for a couple of years and see what differences I see. Thank you gkunkle for the opportunity. 847 charactersdepechemode1983, Dec 29, 2010
4.41/5  rDev -1.6%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.510 oz. of 2010 Reserve on tap at Stub & Herb's on 12/16/2010, served in a wide mouthed chalice like glass. Described by Deschutes as, "Stout brewed with licorice and and molasses with 33% aged in oak and oak bourbon barrels," and, "It's dark. It's deep. It's mysterious. This imperial stout has immeasurable depth inviting you to explore and discover its rich complex profile. The flavor of this special brew draws you in further and further with each sip. The Abyss beckons. Enjoy the journey."
Appearance 5/5
Poured pitch black with a tiny muddy hued bubbly head that dissipated soon into a thin collar and a mocha like thin sheet of foam on the surface, leaving some lacing behind. Couple of swirls coaxed a darker and bigger head, and some legs. Looks the part.
Aroma 4/5
Sweet chocolate and coffee notes in the smell. Roast. Bourbon. Lots of harmonious notes that were weak to begin with but got stronger as the beer warmed up and the glass got emptier. Quite complex aroma but closer to a Russian Imperial Stout in my opinion because the roast and coffee seem strongest and barrel character is subdued compared to other barrel aged American Imperial Stouts. Still, the oak-vanilla notes come forward later and meld well towards a unified goodness.
Taste 4.5/5
Perhaps it was the cold serving temperature, or the fact that the style itself is very wide, or perhaps it's not as good as the respect it commands, but the first sip was thin and underwhelming. But things got better with temperature bringing forward a bourbon like sweetness, bright coffee like acidity that could be lacto derived, and a superb finish that's massive on roast, medium-dry, with a very long aftertaste that is full of dark chocolate.
Mouthfeel 4.5/5
Again strongly dependent on temperature, the beer felt thin and overcarbonated at first but got rich and silky later.
Drinkability 4.5/5
A very good tasting and smooth drinking beer that matches well to its alcohol content too. Not my favorite interpretation of the style but a very well done brew. 2,035 characterstewaris, Dec 29, 2010

This was a 2009 bottle and I do remember reading something about infections in this, but no issues here. Pours pitch black with thin brown head. Nice lacing. The beer just looks really thick. Smell is wonderfully complex for an imperial stout - roasted malt, coffee, chocolate, vanilla and oak. Quite a sweet flavour, with some bitterness in there. Thick, smooth mouthfeel. One of the best stouts I've ever had. 490 characterskwjd, Dec 29, 2010
4.63/5  rDev +3.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Got a couple bottles from my dad from CA.
Pours a deep dark black color with a half inch of tan head. Nice lacing and alcohol feet down the glass.
Smells of licorice and coffee. Nice molasses and caramel mixed in. Alcohol is well hidden.
Taste follows smell. Heavy duty coffee/dark chocolate bitterness. Molasses is mixed in nicely.
Mouthfeel is heavy but the carbonation is a little light.
Drinkability is high. Very inviting and little alcohol burn.
Believe the hype, this is a fantastic beer. I bet this gets amazing in a year, not sure if I'm willing to risk my second bottle to infection. 599 charactersbs870621345, Dec 28, 2010
4.18/5  rDev -6.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5On-tap at O'Brien's in SD.
A - Very dark brown, nearly black and nearly opaque in the glass. Small, long lasting, dense, mocha-colored head. Tons of lacing left all the way down the glass.
S - Dark roasted burnt chocolaty malts, caramel, vanilla, oak and a touch of boozy alcohol. Very inviting.
F/M - Rich dark bitter chocolate, sweet malts, roasted burnt malts, vanilla, oak, slight perfumy alcohol. This is balanced very well, despite its young age. Moderately high bitterness with a rather dry finish. Medium full bodied with moderate carbonation. Lingering vanilla chocolate flavor.
D - This beer is remarkably drinkable, especially for such a huge stout. Big, full flavored, dry and enjoyable, this is one of the best offerings of Abyss in years. 756 charactersdomtronzero, Dec 27, 2010
4.97/5  rDev +10.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5First I have to note that this is uncellared, the "best by" date is 11/15/11 -- I have one in the cellar waiting for that but I got two bottles for Christmas and I could not wait, I've been trying to find this brew everywhere.
The best thing about this beer is everything! The only thing I can fault it on is the appearance - I made sure to clean my glassware especially well but the lacing and head just weren't quite as impressive as I had hoped.
Even still, the it poured pitch black with a hint of dark brown showing at the edge if you hold it in front of very bright light. The head wasn't terribly thick or frothy, but it is a gorgeous lighter color, not very red which is what I usually see on imperial stouts.
It smells like espresso first and foremost, with bready malt and molasses in the background.
The espresso and chocolate are in the front of the palette upon tasting. Many big stouts have used espresso and chocolate well -- the only thing I can say is that this one does it perfectly. The hop balance is incredible, there is only the slightest taste of the 11% alcohol, and it is quickly forgotten with another wave of espresso and chocolate flavor.
I didn't chill this very much -- I popped it in the fridge for maybe 30 minutes before I couldn't wait any longer (not helping my cellared bottle's chances any), but this kind of beer doesn't want to be ice cold anyway. The mouthfeel is great. It sits heavy on the tongue and is mildly carbonated, with pure darkness for the lingering aftertaste.
Drinkability is incredible. At 11% I thought this was something I would have taken a very long time with. I found myself holding it with both hands to let it warm up so I could experience the full range. I want to go pour the rest of the bottle into the glass already. While still chilled, it is at once refreshing and exhilarating, and once warmed it is creamy and lingering.
I don't get many opportunities to try beers are in BA's top 5, my last was Alesmith's Speedway Stout, and I put this right up there with that old chestnut. Beautiful! 2,064 charactersClamwacker, Dec 26, 2010
4.03/5  rDev -10%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Pitch black body, mocha head. I raised a pretty crazy head out of it. Stong smell of molasses, sweet malt, roasted malt, and dark chocolate. A little heat from the alcohol.
Taste is fairly sweet with more molasses and finishing with a coffee like bitterness. Licorice numbs the tongue a little. Maybe the tiniest bit of bourbon. The beer is pretty sweet so it's hard to tell. Not extremely viscous but feels a little chewy. Sugar coats my mouth.
Very delicious and probably my favorite vintage of Abyss so far. 512 charactersBearsOnAcid, Dec 26, 2010
4.4/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4.52010 version.
Appearance: The Abyss looks very black on the pour. It looks fairly viscous, but I have seen other barrel aged stouts that have poured out thicker. About a finger of dark mocha head forms. Retention is very nice, and some great fine lacing remains clinging to the edges of the glass.
Smell: Bitter dark chocolate, licorice, dark fruits and light espresso form the base of this beer. Underlying is vanilla and a light hint of oak and barrel character.
Taste: Bitter dark chocolate, espresso, and dark fruits (plum and fig) are the most prevalent aspects of this beer up front. Vanilla, oakiness and bourbon character follow. The finish is mostly chocolate and coffee with light barrel character. Overall very good, with my only complaint being the lightness of the bourbon barrel presence. 
Mouthfeel/Overall: I would call this beer between medium and full bodied, and probably leaning towards medium. Light for my taste. Carbonation is very low though, still leading to a pretty creamy mouthfeel. Overall, a very good imperial stout. Nice job by Deschutes offering a barrel aged stout that is great and readily available. My only complaint is the relative lack of barrel characteristics. 1,205 characterszhanson88, Dec 26, 2010
5/5  rDev +11.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 52008 Vintage, served for the family on Christmas, one of the most memorable beers I've had
A: This motor oil....Abyss pours pitch black with a dark brown, almost purple, color head. Retention is really good for the ABV, but not amazing for the style
S: Molasses, caramel, toffee, lactose, TONS of fruit (dates, figs, apples)...really impossible to summarize, and anything I say won't do it justice.
T: Whoa...like double rainbow shit! So complex...sweet, charred, smokey, nutty, woody (oaky), fruity, just wow. Absolutely tons of molasses. If you are reading this review for a reference, do yourself a favor and post an ISO thread instead.
MF/D: Perfectly viscous, creamy, velvety, super smooth. Carbonation is spot on, finish is lactose/awesomeness. 
Notes: Truly remarkable. I really enjoyed this beer, and looking forward to acquiring another. Not over-hyped in my mind, and if you think so, I'll give you my address so you can ship it to me
As far as complexity...this is comparable to KBS for sure, but they are just too different from each other to compare in terms of which is better. 1,097 charactersscottyshades, Dec 26, 2010
4.4/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4.522 oz. bottle, 2010 vintage, enjoyed with neighborhood beer buddy Christmas Eve 2010, paired with stout infused brownies and vanilla ice cream.
1 1/2 finger brown head, medium dissipation with decent lacing. Deep brown almost black body, no visible carbonation due to ultra dark hue. Let the beer warm before serving to enjoy the licorice, molasses, brown sugar, some caramel and roast, hop aroma on the floral side, tres complex. Taste mirrors nose, not a big hop blast. Mouthfeel, surprisingly was a bit thin for the style, good carbonation. We didn't have any trouble finishing the bottle. This was a really young bottle, will update review upon opening one of the (hopefully not infected) 2009 bottles I have in the cellar. Other than the thinnish mouthfeel, this was one fine beer.
EDIT- I've had several 2009 vintages and none were infected. A bit on the flat side, but similar profile as 2010, though not as complex as 2007 vintage. 941 charactersjdense, Dec 25, 2010

Cocoa notes to it. Tastes like dark chocolate with some brewers licorice and a hint of old coffee. Truly delicious - definitely a beer to impress. Has a very creamy mouthfeel but is also a bit boozy. This was a fresh 2010 bottle but I would love to have it again in a year and see what happens. Drinkable but a bit strong. 451 charactersbeerhan, Dec 25, 2010

Excellent completely black pour with a brown head that quickly recedes, nice legs on it.
you can smell molassas, dark malts a hint of licorice and a general sweetness to it that tries to cover up the boozy scent but doesnt quite do it
malt and molassas up front with a nice boozy taste that is not overpowereing. very heavy mouthfeel that is a good thing though.
drinkability is good, but would have to share this beer with someone due to abv and how thick it feels
would definitely like to get a few more abyss and age them out a little more and see how they benefit from it. 757 charactersrowingbrewer, Dec 25, 2010
4.51/5  rDev +0.7%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 42009 vintage, poured at just under 50 degrees into a laser-etched 0,4l snifter.
Appearance - Don't bother trying to look through it, as it is opaque; one of the darkest beers around, it's as black as hole in space. Thick mocha head full of suds, with excellent retention and moderate lace.
Smell - Malt and yeast up front, followed by coffee and chocolate. A little bit of molasses follows, though faint. A little bit of oakiness comes out as the beer opens up. The smell was very potent right as the bottle was opened.
Taste - Incredibly full-bodied, this brew tastes like a beer latte. The coffee and chocolate character apparent in the aroma blend in the beer to give the malty character an almost mocha taste. Grain is subtle. Malt is a little roasted and a little sweet. Overall, the beer is incredibly balanced. Hop character is spicy, with bitterness building after a while. Very little noticeable alcohol heat.
Mouthfeel - Creamy foaminess, heavy on the tongue, lighter going down. Thick as it is, the beer is remarkably viscous. Carbonation isn't huge, but makes itself known. All aspects of the mouthfeel only serve to compliment the taste.
Drinkability - This one went by too quickly. For as heavy a beer as it is, you shouldn't be able to drink it this quickly. For the style, the drinkability is remarkable.
Overall - I wouldn't mind having a few more bottles of this business. There's no question that it's a truly world-class beer. If you can get your hands on it, don't hesitate.
NB - Drank a bottle of this in May of 2010, and another in December 2010, both 2009 vintage. The one with less age was more sweet with hotter booziness; the one with more age was more balanced, drier, and the alcohol was much less noticeable. This review is based on the December tasting. 1,791 charactersChronofied, Dec 24, 2010
4/5  rDev -10.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Doing a comparison of 09 and 10. With my buddy Pete who's in town for the holidays. Welcome home Pete. Both poured into the same St. Bernardus snifter with a thorough rinsing between each.
09:
Note: I have had several 09 Abyss bottles this year and have yet to have an infected one. This one is no different. The case I bought must have been from a better batch. Thank the stars.
A: Color is a brown stained black. With nice quarter finger head and simple lacing. Mild retention.
S: A wide variety of flavors come out. A smokey alcohol sent up front, cocoa, tobacco, some woody barrel hints. 
T: Pretty much as it smells, but much less boozy than I would have thought given the smokey alcohol aroma. The cocoa really shines here. Hints of toffee and tobacco as well. Definitely recommend letting it warm up as the flavors really come out.
M: Rich and thick, smooth viscous texture. Slight bubbling.
D: After a year of aging the alcohol is well hidden. Very tasty and smooth. Very easy to drink. Surprisingly so for such a big stout.
Overall: I love it. I'm excited to see to see how it continues to change as I still have a few and have had great luck with them. I still prefer Parabola, but to date this continues to be one of the best Imp Stouts I've ever had. Deserving of all the praise it receives.
Now on to the 2010 batch to conclude my little comparison.
2010:
Note: Under the cap, which was difficult to remove because it's wax sealed, are printed the words "Bravely Done". I thought this was a subtle but nice touch.
A: Slightly darker than the 09. The brownish tint is not present as it was in the 09. Very little to no head, less than seen in the 09.
S: Wow. Much less bourbon to the aroma. Cocoa is much more dominant than in the 09. Hints of coffee and vanilla. A very nutty presence that has taken me by surprise.
T: I have to say wow again. Strong cocoa flavor. With a nutty presence. Again, much less smokey alcohol presence than the 09 but still present. Chocolate maltyness. Quite delicious.
M: Slightly more viscous than the 09, but the reduced carbonation makes this softer on the tongue. Very smooth.
D: Due to the reduced carbonation and the great job they did hiding the alcohol, this is incredibly drinkable. Especially for such a heavy stout.
Overall: I find this to be superior fresh than the 09 was with a year on it. Fantastic. I will enjoy drinking this batch for years to come and look forward to seeing how it ages. Well done Deschutes. I highly recommend this to anyone and everyone.
My score for 09 is:
A: 3.5, S: 3.5, T: 4.0, M: 4.0, D: 3.0 = B
My score for 10 is:
A: 4.0, S: 4.0, T: 4.0, M: 4.0, D: 4.0 = A 2,649 charactersmrmiles, Dec 24, 2010
3.4/5  rDev -24.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3This review is for the 2010 batch.
Pours pitch black with a big, tan, finely laced head. Head slowly progresses to lingering rocky tan head. Very beautiful.
Aroma was very nice and filled with big wafts of caramel and molasses.
Flavor was huge right off the bat. Over the top with licorice and molasses, followed with more moderate caramel. Alcohol is beyond warming, seems a bit hot. Can taste some of the bourbon barrel up front, but quickly is overpowered by the other flavors. Bitterness is herbal and quite apparent.
Mouthfeel is creamy and lingers down the throat. Very nice.
Overall this beer had some interesting flavors that I felt were not well balanced. The licorice and molasses combined with the hop bitterness did not meld well for my pallet. There was not enough oak flavor for me. Some reviewers have said that they prefer this low oakiness to other over-oaked stouts, but for me it was too subtle, or perhaps just overpowered by the licorice, molasses and hop flavors. I wish it would have had more time in the barrel or a higher proportion of barrel aged beer in the blend. This said, I would like to save a bottle in the cellar for 1-3 years to see if the flavors become more harmonious with age. 1,220 characterslionchow, Dec 23, 2010
4.25/5  rDev -5.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Pours a deep, dark brown colour, very dark with just a murky brown at the rim. Head is a deep, dark umber - possibly the darkest head I've seen. Sinking here and there but retains a wonderful, really impressive thick amount. Lace is very impressive and clumpy and just hangs around. That beer is here to stay. Very impressive.
Smells very rich and roasty, but not burnt. Has a strong unsweetened chocolate component, sweet at the back but mostly just intense toastiness. Pleasant spice along with it, some cumin, star anise and nutmeg. Slight sour woody note as well; very pleasant indeed.
Taste is really quite intense. A lot of dry roasted characters with potent cocoa and leather on the front as well as dark roasted grain. As with all very good imperial stouts, one sip explodes with flavour in my mouth, foregoing the need to drink this too quickly without savouring. There's a really strong alcohol heat from quite early in the palate, which is complemented by harsh spice, pepper and aniseed. Fortunately there is no fusel alcohol flavour and it's just warm and a delightful stinging giving me exquisite pain. Some fruit on the back, with figs and oak wood and a slight smokey edge. Very explosive, flavoursome and complex beer. However, I can't say I'm as enamoured with this as I have been with others in the same vein - Avery Mephistopheles remains the yardstick to me.
Perfectly weighted body, heavy but smooth with a Midash touch as it glissandoes down. Marvelous.
Yeah, that hot alcohol is a downer. But don't let that put a dampener on this otherwise damn fine gargantuan beer. 1,595 characterslaituegonflable, Dec 23, 2010
4.33/5  rDev -3.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.52009 bottle. Just enjoyed the 2010 on tap and wanted to check and see how this batch is doing. Fingers crossed.
A: Pitch black with no highlights and a big tan head.
S: Thick roasted dark malt, cocoa, coffee, lots of oak, and a slight dirt/mustyness.
T: Bourbon and cherry flavors jump out first, followed by charred malt, black licorice, molasses and dark chocolate. Oak has a strong mellowing effect and helps flavors meld. Cherry works okay with chocolate but is uncharacteristic of previous years.
M: Thick body, moderate mouth cling, with slightly high carbonation. Good, but not quite as velvety as some of the best (DL, Yeti, Hunahpu's).
Hmmm... there's a distinctive cherry flavor than I haven't picked up in this beer in the past, which makes you consider developing infection. Still a good beer, but doesn't inspire much confidence in the remaining bottles of 2009 I have. Score reflects both this bottle and previous ones. I did find myself bumping up the score as the bottle had more time to open up and will readjust after trying aged 2010. 1,058 charactersGeezLynn, Dec 22, 2010
4.9/5  rDev +9.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Aside from being able to try Alaskan Smoked Porter for the first time, this was my other heavenly experience at Savor 2010, but I decided to not review it because I hadn't been able to take copious notes, and the notes that I did take, I haven't been able to find. However, a dear friend surprised me with a bottle recently. Oh baby...
Into a tulip, it poured black, with two fingers of dark mocha-colored head that retained and laced excellently. No visible carbonation. Bodaciously huge chocolate nose, yet intertwined with mocha, vanilla, and molasses. The great thing about the taste is that I think I detected something different at each sip; very varied and complex, despite the fact that the dark chocolate flavor will bash you over the head. Bittersweet chocolate, Nestle Quik powder, anise, molasses, vanilla, and mocha/coffee, with a semi-dry coffee finish. Excellent flavor progression and balance. The feel was on the thick side, yet velvet smooth, and it provided an appropriate backdrop for the flavor profile. Definitely not a session beer, but an outstanding sipper. I was blown away by this beer. Twice. 1,121 charactersdonniecuffs, Dec 22, 2010
4.88/5  rDev +8.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 508' Abyss, black wax. 1st in the Christmas 2010 "Great Stout Tasting." Out of the '09 KTG, '09 Dark Lord, '08 Abyss... This one got 2 of 7 votes for first and the KTG got the other 5. I had been reading a lot on BA how the '08 was tasting perfect right now. Oh how you were right my brothers. This was magnificent. Reminiscent of the 89' James Cameron flick. 
A - It's body reminds me of the black hole. It's head is one of the darkest I've ever seen. I caught a glimpse of the beer in my tulip and after a flash there was just emptiness. 
S - Lots of chocolate coffee and molasses. Not as impressive as the taste in my opinion. That's knit picking though. I can tell this beer is going to be a giant. 
T - This 08' is drinking perfectly right now. Huge roasted malt, chocolate, expresso, molasses, vanilla, licorice. So complex and bold. There's even a nice hop backbone to balance out the sweetness. Definitely a top contender in the heavyweight RIS division. It really doesn't get much better than this. 
M - Mouthfeel is perfect. Smooth, bold, aggressive yet balanced. I love it. 
D - Right up there with KTG, tried my best to sip and enjoy but had a hard time with it. Goes down so easy and really coats the palate nicely. My first from Deschutes and I am very impressed. 1,281 charactersDNICE555, Dec 20, 2010

In comparison to the 2009 vintage, the 2010 has a much more noticeable bourbon taste on the finish, with a slightly more pronounced molasses taste up front.
This beer is the best stout I have had to date, seeing how I like it more than my previous favorite stout (abyss 09), try and get your hands on this one, it's readily available for now, but I don't know how long that will last 439 charactersShmeal, Dec 20, 2010
4.52/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.52010 Nitro tap from Deachutes' Portland Pub....
Poured opaque black with a light brown head. Head retained about a centimeter on the surface and plenty of lacing along the walls of the glass. 
Nose was roasty, chalky, coffee, and cocoa. Palate was velvety smooth. Which masked the alcohol quite a bit allowing this to be very drinkable. Notes of licorice, chocolate, molasses, burnt brown sugars, ginger, and a whiskey-ish vanilla malt sweetness. 
I would say this is one of the best Abyss experiences I have had. Whether fresh or aged. The nitro version is just to die for. 577 charactersboMD, Dec 19, 2010
4.74/5  rDev +5.8%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Had the 2009 on tap and just sampled the 2010 fresh from the bottle. Poured a deep black with half an inch of dark mocha head. Much fuller aroma than the 2009 (perhaps due in part to the tulip glass instead of the pint glass used for the '09) with a strong molasses presence in addition to roasty dark cocoa, coffee, and faint licorice.
 Mouthfeel was perfectly balanced with moderate carbonation and a full, creamy texture that wasn't at all syrupy (although I slightly preferred the feel of the '09 on tap). Flavor remained consistent with lots of molasses, dark chocolate, licorice, and roasty coffee. The oaky, bourbony flavors seemed more present in the 2010, which I definitely enjoyed.
The alcohol presence is notable on the warming finish, yet this beer goes down so easy. Enjoyed the 2009 version and loved this one even more. Bought lots of extra bottles for the cellar!
UPDATE 1: 2009 bottle opened in 07/2011. Infected, with a mildly sour cherry flavor mingling and mostly overpowering the other flavors. Dang.
UPDATE 2: 2008 bottle opened in 07/2011. Seemed to be going downhill a bit. Definitely smoother with a subtler molasses/cocoa sweetness and less alcohol burn. Paired with some chocolate that actually brought out the remaining hop presence pretty markedly. However, there were some slight metallic/cardboard flavors beginning to show, especially at colder temperatures and on the finish. I would say it's time to drink this one up. 1,457 charactersgrittybrews, Dec 19, 2010

2010 vintage on nitro at the Portland pub before my flight. 
A: Appears impenetrable black with a gigantic light brown creamy head. Great retention. Looks like a beast, like a gaping crevasse affording the viewer a glimpse of nothingness and totality simultaneously. 
S: Aroma is anise and a moderate roasted malt profile with big blackstrap molasses notes. Dark chocolate is pervasive, and there's an earthy quality present. 
T: Rich and decadent, the beer boasts a big blackstrap molasses presence accompanying bitter dark chocolate, roasted malt, and some booze. The bitter chocolate finish is warming and dry. The beer strikes a nice balance between dry and sweet. Simply delicious. 
M: The nitro mouthfeel is silky and smooth, the body is full. 
Overall: Outstanding batch this year. Not overly aggressive and great flavor. 849 charactersHopHead84, Dec 19, 2010
4.87/5  rDev +8.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Serving glass: Poured from bottle into Snifter.
Appearance: Almost pitch black with strong initial head that dissipates but leaves lots of bubbly lacing.
Smell: Massive amounts of molasses and licorice. Nice layers of oak mustiness, coffee and light citrus.
Taste: Oh my God, this is unbelievable. The sweet molasses and licorice complement the harsher roasted qualities of coffee, char and dark chocolate. The partial oak aging imparts an extra Bourbon-like layer, as does the slightly bitter and citrusy hop finish.
Feel: Extremely smooth with low carbonation and a thick full body. Nice dry and warming finish.
Drinkability: Simply fantastic. Maybe the best Imperial Stout I have ever had. Now I need to find another bottle to cellar. 742 charactersbsp77, Dec 19, 2010

A: Poured dark, with a pleasingly thick head. The foam was a nice dark brown, very cohesive laving little in the way of lacing. 
S: A strong smell of roasted molasses and malt. Very complex with a strong hint of chocolate and a little bit of wood in there as well. Not a hint of the alcohol I know to be there.
T: The taste follows the smell with a fair amount of fidelity, but not with the same order. The chocolate comes through quite well and there's a powerful hit of molasses. There's a bit of a different flavor which is probably the licorice. It packs quite the complex suite of flavors.
M: A nice full body which sits comfortably. It goes down very smoothly. This bottle has been aged for a few years so that's to be expected. 
D: I would undoubtedly drink more, and because it's so smooth and strong this would be a dangerous proposition. I wholeheartedly approve. This will be the standard to which I hold an Imperial Stout. 1,038 charactersmjyoung, Dec 19, 2010

I first had the Abyss a few years ago on a ski trip to Idaho. The bar served PINTS of the stuff. I was impressed then, and I'm still impressed now.

4.4/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 42009 Vintage. Poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint. 
A- Very dark, black to dark brown, with no other colors emerging in the presence of light. The billowing head consisting of S-M bubbles has a beautiful color of chocolate milk, and a good amount of lacing holding on to the glass. 
S- A roasty malty nose appears early with a little bit of an anise, probably from the licorice, emerging deeper into the glass. A small amount of dark chocolate, a touch of alcohol, and a bit of a woody smell is there too. 
T- A note of rich chocolate, with a touch of alcohol warmness starts out on the palate. A taste of smoked wood, coffee flavors, and an almost a whisky flavor really comes through a little deeper into the glass as it warms. 
M- Abyss has a very thick, rich mouthfeel, the molasses really has a nice impact on the mouthfeel. Very little effervescence dances on the tongue.
D- I was really impressed with this beer. I know that the 2009 Abyss has had it's problems with infection, and I thought after the trip across the Pacific, this one had no chance. But much to my surprise, and happiness, this one had none of the characteristics of other reviewers who have had an affected bottle. If you can pick up this bottle, I would say go for it!! Wonderful complex flavors come out in this beer. One of the best I've had. 1,327 charactersbirddogg66, Dec 17, 2010

Smell is earthy hops, a bit of alcohol heat, some oak. not all that inviting.
taste is much more appealing than smell. Amazingly complex, Roast and vanilla up front gives way to fusel alcohol heat, oak, molasses and licorice linger in my mouth after a few sips. a ton of tasty flavors going on here.
Really great creamy mouthfeel with moderate to high carbonation. Exceptional on the tongue.
this bottle is super fresh and a bit hot. I will be generous with my rating here as I can see this being more drinkable with a few months of age on it. 697 characterspdoran10, Dec 16, 2010
4.8/5  rDev +7.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Here it is. I purchased this bottle of the 2009 vintage early in 2010, and have been savouring it for as long as possible. I feel my 1,000th beer review on BeerAdvocate was a suitable time to crack it open. Shared with @LaitueGonflable and @tobeerornottobe.
Pours in a sinewy curve, a black and oily body. Even the pour seems heavy, although once it's in the glass and has settled, it's remarkably fluid. Head is huge and boisterous to begin with, leaving quite a dark mass of brown bubbling on top, and cascading down the sides of the glass. Lacing is thick, sticky and intricate. It's a fantastic looking beer. There are few better that I've laid eyes upon.
Nose is that absolutely classic American imperial stout melange of bourbon barrel, vanilla, coconut sweetness and raw, aggressive blackness. Rich and thick, with enough almost corporeal aroma to stick around, dancing inside the nostrils for a long time. holy crap, what an astounding nose.
Taste is where this starts to set itself apart from the general flow of the style. Here, the liquorice starts to assert itself, giving a sharper character to the palate, along with the dark and brusque roasted bitterness. The sweetness has all but dropped out in the flavour, although the bitterness in the back gives hints of overcooked chocolate cake. Feel is phenomenally good. Smooth and silky, but leavened by the almost physical character of spicy anise.
Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes. What a way to celebrate #1000. This is a truly phenomenal and exceptional beer, with such classic characters mixed with such uniqueness and a full-bodied head-pound of complexity and flavour. There's a reason this is so well regarded, and it's totally deserving of its place in the craft beer zeitgeist.
Fantastic. 1,754 characterslacqueredmouse, Dec 15, 2010

A: Black as night with a thin tan head. Decent retention.
S: Dark Malts with Coffee, Chocolate and Black Liquorish.
T: Simply amazing. Super smooth, roasty and a bit of smoke. Not as much chocolate or coffee as one would think, but I assume that's due to age. Alcohol is not present in the taste at all. Some brown sugar, vanilla and wood.
M: This is tops as well. Smooth, well carbonated, and creamy. Nice full body, with no alcohol tinge.

Appearance: Yup, completely opaque. No highlights. Brown head is thick and soft looking. Sticky brown lacing. A damn good looking beer.
Smell: Coffee, bittersweet chocolate, licorice, oak, leather, tobacco, earth. Alcohol too, a deep whiff stings the nose a little. 
Taste: Roasty coffee, slight fruitiness, and oak. The licorice comes through and I'm getting the leather again. Not really too bourbony. Bitter ethanol, then a dry, roasty finish that lasts. The aftertaste becomes a little cake-like. Its rich and complex, but not a chocolatey or sweet bomb like some big stouts.
Mouthfeel: The carbonation is well done, giving the beer a bit of a creamy, foamy feeling in the mouth. The body of the beer feels on the thin side, at least up front, but gets thicker and chewier on the way back. 
Drinkability: A great, complex imperial stout. Damn glad mine wasnt sour. 938 charactersrapidsequence, Dec 15, 2010

S: hot (EtOH), burnt licorice, and medium nose
T: good beer with burnt licorice and nice but somewhat metallic, bitter finish - definitely can taste the EtOH and is a bit on the hot side in general, decent stout but could use a bit more depth (seemed a bit one-dimensional with burnt flavor) and barrel taste

Poured from the bottle into medium sized (12 oz) tulip glasses & shared with a friend.
Deep brown-black color with a creamy 1/2" mocha head, settled down to a thin layer after a few minutes. Left some lacing.
Smells rich and inviting, with mostly a chocolate cake character, a little molasses as it warms.
The taste is incredibly dry, rich, and complex. Baking chocolate, dried coffee grounds, soil-like earthiness, some ash, oak, licorice root, a tiny bit of vanilla now and then. Molasses notes (without sweetness) come out more as it warms. A bit too hoppy at first, but it mellows out after a while. The aftertaste goes on for quite a while and bounces around through all of the flavors. Tasted its best near room temperature.
The texture is medium bodied but near room temp became thicker and a little syrupy, still finished dry though.
The super dryness and earth & ash notes take down the drinkability, it would have been hard to drink the bomber on my own.
A very interesting beer, it was not at all what I expected. I've had a couple of imperial stouts I would say I like better, but for its uniqueness and complexity this (possibly infected) Abyss certainly stands out. 1,312 charactersbusternuggz, Dec 11, 2010

A: Opaque and the darkest of browns, with a mocha colored head that looks like rich milk chocolate...small bubbles on the head and surprising staying power for a high abv BA beer.

MF: Extremely creamy and silky, full mouthfeel with good viscosity and a light to medium dryness on the finish.

Having it side by side next to the tap version was an eye-opening experience. Huge thanks to ramnuts for hosting me and taking me around to try these awesome beers. 
A: Pours, as does the regular version, a viscous-looking black with a menacing dark mocha head. The bubbles are fine, cascading up the glass as is characteristic of a good nitro pour. The retention is great, and the lively appearance is exquisite to behold. 
S: Unlike the tap version, the sweeter elements emerge here. I typically find nitro beers dull and muted, but here the aroma is still pungent. Strong emphasis on anise, dark chocolate, molasses, brown sugar, and a smattering of espresso. 
T: As in the nose, the sweeter flavors take center stage. It's almost candy-like, with a concoction of dark chocolate, molasses, brown sugar, and anise. I seem to pick up marshmallow here, too. Espresso, vanilla and bourbon flit in and out, but the woodiness of the tap version is barely detectable. Near the top of its category. 
M: Much smoother than the tap; the fine bubbles give it a creamy, velvety texture. They also suppress the astringency in the finish, seemingly enhancing the sweetness. Bu there is still enough hop presence to prevent it from becoming treacly. Can't criticize anything here, except that it has a mild heat to it. 
D: Abyss was the beer that made me interested in craft. I've tried dozens, probably closer to a hundred, barrel-aged imperial stouts since then. I have a small nostalgic fondness for this one, but I feel it's justified given that Deschutes actually hit it out of the park on this one.
If I had to rank the beers in the flight, I'd say... 
'10 nitro and '07 tap (tie)
'10 tap
'09 tap
'08 tap (it was still boozy for some reason) 1,862 charactersArbitrator, Dec 05, 2010

5/5  rDev +11.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5The most perfectly crafted beer I have ever consumed (again)!
This review is for the 2010 release. Tasted with 2010 nitro, 2009, 2008, 2007 releases at the Portland Deschutes brewpub on December 1st, 2010 (Abyss release day!) Sadly they sold out of the limited number of 2007 and 2008 bottles within an hour!
2010 regular tap: showing very well, though youthful with a ton of astringency that will mellow with bottle age. This baby is heavy, rich, unctuous, and lively! The aromas and flavors definitely dwell on the dark and somewhat evil influence of dark, bitter chocolate with fruit notes from the licorice and hops. Tons of freshly ground espresso beans on the nose and palate. Also, there is a rich note of oak with grippy tannins on the palate. Sports a finish that goes on and on and on....
2010 nitro: same as above just slightly more texture and less astringency. Great for drinking now while the bottle and regular tap are a little intense. (Too bad it won't be around long!)
2009: tasted several times over the last year, and this was my latest taste. Still very young with emphasis still on rich tannins and hops. Needs 1 more year of cellaring!
2008: my personal favorite. This vintage is a little slutty ~ lots of rich chocolate on a polished and more subtle texture than the newer vintages. Cellaring has definitely made an improvement!
2007: if the '08 were an Oregon pinot, then '07 would be Burgundy. This vintage is smoky, velvety, yet subtle with more of the fruit and licorice notes present; also has a lot of espresso and some hints of toasty oak. My second favorite! 1,596 characterscbarrett4, Dec 02, 2010

All I have to say is whoa. Great stout here, and it realy distinguishes itself from the other big stouts.
Black as hell with thick creamy brown head. Nice lacing. Nose is a rich combination of chocolate, coffee, smoke, leather, and other dark malty notes. Flavor is huge, very complex. One of the big flavors that sets it apart is a distinct smokiness to it, which I like a lot. Some wood, dark roasted malts--coffee, chocolate--some dark fruit to it. It all plays together really nicely, definitely one of my all-time favorite stouts. Not cloyingly sweet like some others.
MF is good, thick, creamy, chewy. Maybe a hair lighter than some of the big hitters. Really a pretty easy drink (and super enjoyable). The smoke and roast to it balances out the sweetness in the malt nicely. This is what imperial stouts should be like. 851 charactersLordAdmNelson, Dec 01, 2010
4.2/5  rDev -6.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 42009 Bomber poured into an Appalachian mini-pint.
A - Pours dark as night with a small brown head that dissipates to only a few patches of head and a ring around the outside of the glass, leaving only spotty lacing.
S - Rich coffee, molasses, licorice, and chocolate notes. As it warms more and more booze comes thru. No hints of infection in this one. I must have gotten lucky.
T - Lots of deep roasted flavors up front slowly giving way to hints of chocolate, coffee, and other dark, earthy, flavors. Finish is pretty hot from all the booze with a lingering roast. Flavors were pretty well balanced but the heat from the alcohol is a bit much after a few glasses. I enjoyed this one but not as much as I did when I had it on-tap during philly beer week. 
M - Heavy body and flavor with moderate carbonation. Strong burn from the booze with a heavy roasted finish. It was a bit overwhelming after a few fills of my glass.
D - Fairly high. Opened this one last night. I figured if it was infected I would rather find out now rather than later. Luckily it was fine. I enjoyed this one a lot. It was still a little too hot for my liking but it was still very nice. 1,167 charactersorangesol, Dec 01, 2010
4.28/5  rDev -4.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4I got this bottle from a friend who brought this back from Oregon. It was the 2009 release. It says best AFTER Nov. 2010. Now I read about the 'infected" batches. So let's find out...
I poured this into my favorite glass and got a wonderful shiny black body as it poured and an equally opaque body with a rather robust tan head. It goes away gradually as I type but leaving lace as it goes. A good start.
The nose? Will this tell me anything. It is chocolate, malt and yes some bandaid. 
Taste is...(drumroll) Very bitter at first with a dark coffee finish. Wow!!! This is a strong flavored beer. It is like double charcoal. I know that is a made up term, but I struggle for words here: charcoal, oak, bitter, malt, cocoa. The flavor remains in your mouth for a while. No need to hurry this one. Drinking this bomber by myself. The second glass is way better. More creamy mouth feel, flavor is changing for the better. 
Mouth feel is similar to another I had recently. It feels like there might be some cocoa granules in the mix. Not all that carbonated and not as "thick" as some others. Alcohol is not bashful. All in all I don't think this is one of the infected ones which I felt were described as being a little sour. This beer is different than most stouts I have had. It is not as sweet, but then again this one has already been around awhile. I hear rumors that Deschutes may come to the Midwest. I would like to try another one. For me to wait a year after bottling to drink a beer is rare. I am not patient. 1,521 charactersdaledeee, Dec 01, 2010

2009 Vintage.
A- Pours a deep brown with a big two and a half finger mocha head. The head takes a while to die down and leaves some spotty lacing on the side of the glass.
S- My fears about this beer has come true. I have an infected Abyss. Smells like a wild stout. Some funkiness dominates the nose to go along with sour cherries, roasted malt and a little bit of milk chocolate.
T- Lots of infection, I mean funkiness. Sour cherries, a little smokiness and some chocolate notes. Nothing else is very apparent besides the tartness.
M- Medium bodied with ample carbonation. Dry on the finish but I am not sure if that was the way it was intended or due to the infection. 
D- Pretty much a drain pour. I was hoping I would be one of the lucky ones but alas, I was not. Looking forward to trying to '10 though. 850 charactersWisconsinality, Nov 27, 2010
4.01/5  rDev -10.5%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.5Thanks to CooperEllis for sharing this bottle with me at a recent tasting and helping me knock #4 off August's Top100! We got lucky tasting a non-infected 2009 vintage bottle about a week before the "best after" date. 
This baby is pitch black. And it's got the most incredible lacing and legs I've seen in a while. You could drink a glass of this, come back 20 minutes later, and you'd have another ounce in your glass. It's boozy though, and that comes through in the smell. But the licorice comes first and is followed by a mix of complex stuff that I'm not equipped to describe. I wrote down "anise" in my notes. That's gotta be there. Because it's sure in the taste. Almost too much. I'm in love with Good 'n' Plenty's, and probably will be for a while, but this one womped me with licorice. 
That said, it's probably one of the most complex ones I've tasted in a while, and it took a half bottle to get any type of read on what my palate should expect. It's a full-bodied brew that's mainly a sipper. One on special occasions seems just about right. 1,057 charactersafksports, Nov 25, 2010
3.73/5  rDev -16.7%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.52009 vintage. I decided I'd waited long enough to see if InfectionGate was all it had been made out to be.
Pours from the bottle a dark, opaque black with a good layer of brownish head. Subsequent pours don't yield as much head. On first pour, with the beer still a big on the chilled side, I fancy I pick up some sour cherry notes, the oft-described early indicator of Abyssfection. After the beer warms, however, I don't smell or taste any such off-flavors. Instead, the nose is on the boozy side, with a little oak aroma peeking through.
The Abyss is much more full in flavor than smell. Flavors are a touch smokey, but moreso the oak and black licorice flavors come through. I'm not finding the flavor all that complex. While the beer does impart a little warming, it doesn't taste all that hot. Mouthfeel are a little on the harsh side for me, and it's really the only place that bitterness comes through. Body is fairly full, as expected.
On the whole, Abyss was okay, as far as big stouts go. I've been sipping it for a few hours now, and it's definitely not a bomber I'd drink regularly. 1,098 charactersRiccymon, Nov 25, 2010

Pours dark black with a dark milk chocolate colored 3 finger head with great retention and lacing. The aroma has licorice, molasses, chocolate, espresso, oak and bourbon.
The beer tastes like the aroma, and is more intense than the aroma, which was a little lighter than expected. The licorice, molasses, chocolate, espresso, oak and bourbon flavors combine perfectly to make a nice sweet beer, with just a little bitterness for balance.
Medium to full bodied, creamy, smooth,with medium carbonation. This is a superb Imperial Stout. Not much heat for an 11.00% abv beer. Thankfully this is not an infected bottle. I will be sure to pick up the 2010 Reserve when it becomes available. 723 charactershardy008, Nov 25, 2010

T- Wow. it first hits with a sweet taste and then dies into a dry roasted malt taste. There is no real alcohol burn just a slight warmth that is a lot less then expected for such a strong beer

4.68/5  rDev +4.5%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 52009 version.
Poured from a 22 oz. bottle into a snifter and impenetrable abyss (sorry, couldn't resist) of black. Held up to a bare lightbulb and not light could poke through.
The aroma was licorice, molasses, vanilla, dried plums, burnt grain, dark chocolate, and firewood-roasted marshmallows. Complex and inviting.
The taste followed the nose perfectly but with the added bonus of espresso in the middle. I didn't get the aroma of coffee/espresso in the nose but it was there in the flavor. The taste gets considerably better as it warms and blends together. I didn't think it possible but the sweet vanilla (from the wood) grows stronger the warmer it gets.
Smooth, oh so smooth. Molten chocolate cake in a glass. I know there's alcohol in here but I can't taste it all.
This is what other Imperial stouts want to be when they grow up. I can only imagine how good this gets with age on it. 899 charactersBuckeyeOne, Nov 17, 2010
3.98/5  rDev -11.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4I had the 2009 version on three times this year, twice from bottle and once on tap.
Color of both the head and the beer were very dark. Barely any shine through.
Smell was moderatley strong, more so from the bottles than on the tap. Smelled of heavily roasted malts; coffee, and bitter chocolate.
Mouthfeel was lighter than expected, conversely there was a stronger taste of alcohol.
Taste: Same as smell, a hint of bitter chocolate, followed by dark coffee, then chocolate again. Alcohol present strong, but complimentary, not dominating. 
Tap and Bottle Differences: Nothing much, except the tap had a lighter mouthfeel and stronger alcohol tones than from the bottle. Differences were minor. 699 charactersHoptoss, Nov 15, 2010
4.36/5  rDev -2.7%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5I'm glad I caught the tail-end of this barrel at Red Bones NW Fest on 11/12/10.
Appearance: Very deep black (it almost looks brown a little around the edges) and makes my pint glass (yes, I had a full pint of this bad boy!) look like an opaque plastic cup. Very rich and thick brown frothy head that took quite a while to settle. It does have a somewhat red wine looking coloration on the edges of the glass as you drink it. Very deep and looks the part.
Aroma: Dark, bitter chocolate for sure, but definite hints of spices and subtle alcohol heat. Rich smelling.
Taste: The most unique aspect of this beer is the anise/licorice notes I get on top of the traditional dark chocolate. Creates a rich, almost spicy flavor that gets richer as the boozy heat opens up your taste bud. The more I drink of this pint, the more the smokey undertones come out. It isn't just a burnt flavor, which is there, but more of a BBQ/hickory flavor. Very layered flavor that develops as your drink.
Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Nice big and rich body, but not that filling. This one goes down very smooth considering the ABV and style. Having two of these in one night would be a great session. The linger on it is just right too. It allows flavors to develop throughout the glass, but doesn't overstay or overwhelm the palette.
Overall: I can understand the hype, not so much because this is one of the best beers I've ever had, but because it is unique for the style. The smokey, licorice taste goes well with the big chocolate and roasted malt that was expected. The body is also dangerously drinkable.

4.47/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Had this last night on tap at Red Bones BBQ, surprised/relieved that this hadn't kicked yet.
16 oz pour into a pint glass instead of the 10.5 oz listed on the menu, fine with me! Poured opaque black, so black that I swear the lights got dimmer when it was poured because it could suck all the light out of a room. Caramel colored two-finger light head that had good retention for a RIS. This looked like you would expect a RIS to look like, but with a little added darkness in body and wood color in the head from the barrels. Smelled largely of vanilla, currents, chocolate and coffee. Faint earthy aromas mixed with a little booze. Tasted even better than it smelled. All of the same flavors from the nose, mostly vanilla, coffee and chocolate. Brown sugar was now noticeable along with decent floral hops to make it just bitter enough. The wood/earthy flavors pulled through a bit stronger than before, too. Bourbon in the way back, enough to compliment but not overpower. Felt thick and rich, very creamy and viscous. Coating and filmy. Low carbonation rounds out the body. Drinks incredibly easy for 11% and, thankfully, not overly boozy like I thought fresh '09 BCBS was. Maybe the year it sat mellowed it out some, but this beer was delicious and drank very well, regardless. I wanted to drink another glass because it tasted so nice and balanced but I didn't order one because I had my fill with the bigger serving size. I would love to have a bottle or two of this aging, but this is definitely one I would want to split with a friend. 1,545 characterskbanks13, Nov 12, 2010
4.53/5  rDev +1.1%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Bottle shared by footbalm. Pours a deep dark brown with a similarly brownish head. The aroma is really great; deep moss covered earth, smoke, coffee, and some sweet molasses. The taste is top notch, really complex and yet so damn smooth. As with many great beers this changes a ton with warming; first, a bitter chocolate flavor with dark fruits, vanilla, brown sugar, and smoke. Later with warming the fruit and roasted malts come to fore, so damn good. A bourbon taste for sure, along with a really great creamy body. The ABV is strong at first, then nonexistent. Wow! All it was hyped to be. Re-rate: at the 2010 Imperial Stout tasting Sam crack open the vertical, 2006-2009! 2006 was sublime, dark fruit, oily and powerful. 2007 might have stolen the show, just amazing; rich fruits, plums and figs, oily can nastiness that I love. My faith in the Abyss is 100%. 2008 and 09 are great, but waiting to peak. I had a whole fresh 2009 recently and didn't dig it as much, but after trying all vintages I know this beer is among the best, and it cellars great. Thanks a ton Sam! 1,077 charactersDouglas88, Nov 10, 2010
4.85/5  rDev +8.3%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Very awesome of Chico to share this one last night... we were both skeptical of infection so I brought along a BA IST just in case (which was infected). Not even close to infected, very awesome since he had to trade across the country for this one.
A- Black as the night sky with a gigantic foamy, dark tan head. The retention on this one rivals any Stout that I can think of. A ton of thick lace coats the entire glass.
S- Very impressive, complex and not overly aggressive. Tons of dark roast malt and a huge blast of oak. The slight bourbon, vanilla backdrop makes this special. Molasses, licorice and a bit of alcohol round out a world class aroma.
T- A lot going on, all of which is superbly balanced. Oak is the one thing I would call very heavy here but it goes so well with the roast malt, molasses, tasteful bourbon, vanilla and licorice (which works quite well). Sweetness is here but in a good way. Slight raisin later on in a flavor with masterfully hidden alcohol.
MF- Thick, oily body with lower end smooth carbonation, very smooth. Slightly warm and some roasty cocoa bitterness feeling. Somewhat creamy.
DB- The first truly world class beer I have had since Pannepot. I found this to be a perfect blend of over the top Bourbon-aged beers like KBS and a regular RIS. The barrel aging is used perfectly and I now realize why this beer has always been in the top 5. Superb balance of a wide array of Stout flavors! 1,432 characterscbutova, Nov 09, 2010
4.95/5  rDev +10.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 52009 vintage - not infected!
It was tempting to open this before the 'best after' date (11/1/10) after the flood of infection reports, I am very glad I waited. Received in a trade from rmjavanut and shared with cbutova.
Black as..sigh..the abyss. Huge puffy, bubbly brown head retains excellently leaving good lacing.
Extremely potent scent of chocolate, licorice, roasted malt, slight bourbon. 
The taste can only be described as 'win'...loads of caramel, licorice, dark chocolate, roasted malt, molasses and espresso are up front. Oak and bourbon appears mid-palate. Hints of dark fruit, smoke and high quality spirits are more noticeable over time. It is sweet and rich, but incredibly well-balanced and complex, gets better with every sip.
Mouthfeel is very smooth and oily, reminds me of Kate the Great. It's impressive but I would've liked to see a bit more heftiness, a very minor complaint. The alcohol is there, but hidden for 11%, and is only another layer to an already huge beer.
Amazingly towering in it's complexities. Just about every flavor I could want in an imperial stout is not only here, but balanced to perfection. Definitely a beer I will seek out multiple bottles of in the future.
**Note - also was honored to try the 2007 vintage, a little over 4 years in the bottle. Definitely mellowed out on the bourbon but holding up great. Lots of flavor, smooth, alcohol well-hidden. Awesome beer. 1,419 charactersChico1985, Nov 08, 2010

appearance: Just beautiful. I love a black beauty and I can't imagine a better example. Perfect blackness with a fat creamy, tan head.
smell: A little gentler than I expected but a lot happening. I don't get the licorice but the molasses is there along with a dark chocolate espresso taming the sweetness.
taste: Wow. Lots happening here too. The molasses and coffee vie for center-stage but pretty much balance out (in a good way). The finish is surprisingly dry and hoppy. It all works wonderfully.
mouthfeel: Velvety, silky, gentle but fat and strong. Can't imagine a better feel.
drinkability: This is amazing. I was going to go lower on the drinkability but as it warms it's just going down so easy.
2 more bottles of 2009 in the beer cave! Look forward to next November to see what happens to this beauty.

2009 - certainly not infected. Into 7oz tasting glass, split 4 ways. From notes
Dark pour, thin tan head - maybe a 1/4". Solid tan lacing moves with the beer, not too thin or too sticky.
Anise in the aroma, a bit of oak/wood. Heavy roated notes.
Amazing flavor depth: roasted malt, dark fruit and anise. Solid carbonation provides this think beer with a bit of lightness that prevents it from sitting heavy in the mouth. 
Really solid sipper. I belive splitting this 4 ways was a little thin, but I also can not envision drinking an entire 22oz bottle myself. It was served at a few degress below room temp and allowed to breathe for short time in the glass. The armoa didn't change much, and the flavor was very full from the outset to the finish.

Bottle cellared for about a year and opened after its 'best after' date of 11/01/10.
Wax sealed bomber poured into a large wine glass. Pours dead black with a rich mocha head and offers good retention and lacing. A notably better pour than the draught version. 
Nose is a bit of a reach. I pick up some oak but more of a wine barrel than whiskey, quite vinous in nature. Nice but not as advertised and with notable wine esters. Bit of earthy chocolate comes out with some warming, along with some sweet cherry.
Flavor is a bit thin for the style yet offers a lingering finish. Offers a touch of the whiskey barrel as the beer warms but still remains subdued. Feel is a bit thin as well. Overall a different animal than a fresh tap pour, pleasant yet unremarkable. 912 charactersHalfFull, Nov 04, 2010

Thanks goes out to DanLucky, NewGeneric and NYCWheatFanSC for providing some of the newer vintage, and a special shout goes out to akbeerfiend for a bottle of the '08. 
It's due date time for the '09, so let's hope the bottle I brought back to Holland is alright. 
From a bomber into a snifter
Vintage: 2009 
Infected. This is a nasty infection too. No foaming or anything upon opening, and the aroma coming out of the bottle didn't smell overly off either. The pour looked decent, though a little overcarbonated, and the nose left me only a slightly concerned. The taste, however, was wretched. Drain enjoyed the full bottle. Undrinkable vinegar. 
Let's try again. 
From a bomber into a snifter
Vintage: 2008 
APPEARANCE: Pours out thick and black, looking pretty sludgy. Pour cascades to a medium-thick looking, two finger, mocha colored head with great retention. Jet black and thick body with no real carbonation evident. Head slowly fades to a full wisp and a bit of foam, leaving sheets of clingy lacing. A splotchy wisp and ring remain until the end, leaving touches of lacing down the glass. Great looking stout for sure. 
SMELL: A bold nose of roasted malts, dark, pure chocolate and a good dose of molasses. Slight notes of bourbon and oak in there as well, but heavier on the chocolate and molasses. The barrel is really well integrated here, without overpowering. 
TASTE: Fantastic stuff. Roasted malts, dark pure chocolate and lots of nice molasses again. Some bourbon and oak notes with hints of booze in there, but everything blends together really well. Bold flavors and a big aftertaste of roasted and charred malts, molasses, dark chocolate, and some well measured bourbon flavors, with a touch of heat at the swallow. Wonderfully integrated and put together. Beautiful. 
PALATE: Medium-full body with medium, soft, velvety carbonation. Very soft and creamy smooth on the palate, velvety, goes down smooth and finishes somewhat dry on the palate. Very soft, creamy, and smooth. Very nice. 
OVERALL: This was unbelievable. I was disappointed when the '09 bottle was infected, but now that I know what the Abyss is all about, the infection problems with the '09 is nothing less than a world-wide disaster. This was sublime. The base stout is fantastic as it is, and barrel aging is done in a manner that compliments the beer wonderfully, as opposed to dominating it. Lots of great, bold flavors that work really well together. This is a world class brew, and one of the best stouts I've ever had. Luckily it is relatively easy to come by, so we'll hope that this year's release is clean. Thanks again akbeerfiend for sending one of these beauties my way. 2,779 charactersJeffo, Nov 03, 2010

I wouldn't say black, but it's about a deep, dark brown as it gets. The head is a dense brown foam that retains well.
Smells of straight dark chocolate or mocha, wood and then toward the end there's vanilla.
This is not a subtle one. A licorice wraps an oak flavor that combines well with bourbon overtones. Sweet molasses lines the edge, almost giving way to mint/vanilla, but really it's closer kin with tobacco. Slight hinting at ginger. The dry-hopped finish has a certain tartness that's not quite cherry and not staining either. The alcohol's not completely masked, but it's not piercing and not a bother.
Not the filling stout I expected. 663 characterspants678, Nov 03, 2010

Dark, dark brown, not as black s expected, but very little light passes through even on the edge. Two fingers of creamy mocha head that lasts forever. Lots of lacing.
Aromas of rye and cola, vanilla, roasted malt, smoke, licorice. Every sniff shows something a little different.
Licorice and tobacco are first noted by the tongue. Lots of roasted malt. Molasses flavour coats the tongue. Smooth flavours leaning towards the sweet side of things but not overly so.
Full smooth body with subtle carbonation and. Very pleasant feel.
This is a monster beer that is hard to put down. Much easier to drink than I expected. Really an amazing brew. 703 characterselricorico, Nov 03, 2010

A- Beautiful! Pitch black with a large head. I've never seen a head like this on an imperial stout! The head did recede into some nice lacing after about a minute.
S- Malt, licorice and a nice subtle bourbon scent.
T- Malt, oak, a little licorice, and a wonderful oaky bourbon in the finish.
M- A little thinner than I would have guessed, but it does have nice carbonation for an imperial stout.
D- Good for the style. I think I could drink another bottle if I had one! 631 charactersphreak1983, Nov 01, 2010
4.76/5  rDev +6.2%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 52009 Vintage enjoyed (relatively young) on 28/10/2010. 
Man looks in the abyss, there's nothing staring back at him. Naturally, it's only fitting that a beer with such a name neither emit nor allow even a single shred of light. And yet it possesses an inexpressible charm which attracts us. Solid, resolute blackness and a lining like clotted blood which insulates it, the beer appears both intriguing and intimidating. But I'm not content just to gaze, it's time I delve deeper into the Abyss... 
The Abyss does indeed beckon, or at least its aroma does. Sharp notes of bourbon hit the sense of smell straight on and rupture in the nostrils powdery notes unrefined cocoa, moist and mildewing wood, an unusual black tea of ancient origins, baked molasses, a dash of paint thinner and tobacco that has been chewed and spit. The amount of scents the nose can pick out is constrained only by the amount of time spent smelling it. 
Bourbon barrel aging can add a ton of depth and complexity to a beer - it can also add a lot of booze and obnoxious bourbon character. And that's why I, personally, am a fan when breweries use the bourbon-aged beer not entirely unto itself but rather as part of a blend. The fact that only 33% of The Abyss was aged in either oak or bourbon-barrel allows it to retain most all of its heavy, roasty, malty, decadent stout character...
While at the same time benefiting from striking distinction and exceptional depth. Hardly a drop of bourbon or a splinter of wood can be tasted outright and yet to the palate is still treated the lush flavour of vanilla, tastes of cigar and tobacco leaf, the hint of singed wood and a generous dash of ginger-like spice. Like a crash of thunder, bitterness resonates over the palate with vivid notes of licorice, cocoa and coffee bean. 
Some Schlegel guy said it about God, but it's no doubt true of this beer as well: "within Him do all spirits dwell. He is an abyss of individuality, the only infinite plenitude". Indeed, this beer hesitates between exotic spices, simple fruit, burnt coffee, sweet malt, intoxicated wood and unsweetened chocolate with a combination of dry, waxy and grassy notes in the background. The carbonation provides strong enough legs to hold it all up. 
I just caught myself fondling the bottle. Maybe it's the booze, or maybe it's just been too long since I last put this wondrous nectar to my lips; the Abyss is certainly intoxicating, in both the literal and figurative sense. There is more to it than I alone can note and attest. If you ever find yourself staring at The Abyss, for God's sake buy the damn thing, as much as you can afford, because, true to its name, this is about as deep as beer gets. 2,702 charactersbiegaman, Oct 28, 2010
4.32/5  rDev -3.6%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Thanks to tenderbranson69 for sharing this at our stout tasting. enjoyed chilled slightly from a tulip.
A big black oily looking formidible ale with medium brown cap which hangs on for a while, lace sticks and bead is tiny. The smell is vinous, very dark cherry and somewhat brett influenced, but not over the top, slight charred scents add to the complexity. The feel is is viscous without being cloying, bitter dry strong and semi tart w/ a very dry finish with slight warming and bitter texture. 
 The Imperial stout is unique to say the least. I have had this before without signs of infection and loved it, but this bottle had some cherry-like brett aspects which implies it is definitely a beer with some oak presence and with lots of black patent type charred flavor of french roasted coffee and alcohol was moderate in the taste with subtle hop complimenting with mild pine and pepper. The flavor is intense and finishes dry and roasty. I would have liked to have this sooner to see what the beer was like before the slight infected flavor had a chance to creep in, but it was mild and I still enjoyed the beer a lot -a high quality Imperial Stout -thanks Tim!
Re-review -1/16//11 '10 version thanks to John Michaelsen for sharing, poured semi chilled into a taster. 
A 4.5 S 4.5 M 4 T 4.5 D 4.5
The look is deep brown tobacco colored with a lot of opacity and thick med tan cap. Lace stickage and retention are good and beading is tight. The smell is like chocolate cake w/ slight smoke and mellow bitter toasted oak w/ mild caramel and hint of woody notes that blend in with the alcohol esters well. The feel is dry bitter and strong with slight cocoa roastiness and mellow carbonation w/ mild creaminess and lots of char w/ moderately high alcohol. 
 The taste is very flavorful right off the bat with roasted flavor that is very high -almost 'meaty' with smoked and woodiness bringing out an umami flavor with slight dark cocoa and light spice w/ vanilla adding to the flavor. There is some alcohol in the taste, but not over the top for the strength. The slight cookie flavor is nice w/ slight astringent/bitter flavor from the highly roasted malts. I enjoyed this way more than the '09, a great Imperial Stout which is very solid and I am glad I got to re-review it. I feel the light infection detracts both from the taste/body so this is way better worthy of its high ranking here and it is more enjoyable in its unfettered form. 2,448 charactersSlatetank, Oct 25, 2010
4.85/5  rDev +8.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Hooray-my 2009 was not infected!
Poured from a 22oz bomber to a snifter
A: Pours thick. Pitch black with a generous coffee colored head. After finishing the glass, you can see the level of the beer after each sip in the lacing-beautiful!
S: Oak and bourbon dominate, with cherries and molasses coming into play as well.
T: All of the aromas come out in the flavors, but are joined by a light smokiness, tobacco, and roasty espresso (not coffee, but espresso). Bourbon is big, but not overpowering. Midway through, I notice a very subtle hint of leathery funk. This beer is surprisingly more bitter than sweet, but a rich, roasty, dark chocolate sort of bitter instead of a hoppy bitter. Very rich and satisfying. Lots going on here, but it is all very well integrated.
M: Thick and viscous. This beer coats your tongue and won't let go. I can taste each sip for a fair few minutes (not hints of taste, not aftertaste, but a thick coating of beer still clinging to my tastebuds!). Carbonation offers a sharpness that counters the richness of the beer nicely.
O: This is simply a beautiful beer. It's thick, rich, and strong enough that I couldn't have too much of this in a sitting, but that's not really the point of this beer. It's one to be sipped slowly over the course of the evening, and what an evening it was! 1,322 characterseatabagofbooger, Oct 24, 2010

22oz bottle, 2009 vintage, best after Nov 1, 2010. Wanted to crack this right around the 1-year mark although I was getting tempted to open it earlier due to threats of possible infection but it appears this bottle is safe! Whew!
Pours thick black with a large foamy brown head, holds a light cap and leaves a few random clumps of lacing.
Aroma is heavy on the oak, bourbon, and vanilla, a lot of roasted malt, chocolate, coffee and anise round things out. Good strength. Give it some time to warm and the aroma gets even better...had to bump it up another point as the strength improves as well as the complexity and an added smoke character and more chocolate, although the main stars are still the wood, bourbon, and vanilla.
Flavor is rich and malty, a ton of dark roasted malt, heavy doses of chocolate and coffee, vanilla and oak are also very prominent with a hint of bourbon, some anise, caramel, toffee, brown sugar, molasses, incredibly complex and delicious. Alcohol is pretty much non-existent although the second half which was left to warm on the counter has a bit of an alcohol bite on the finish.
Mouthfeel is fairly thick and creamy, good for the style, however the carbonation can be a bit prickly at times but subsides a bit as it warms.
There are a bunch of adjectives I could throw down here but I'll just use one: Magnificent. A work of art. 1,403 characterselgiacomo, Oct 24, 2010

A - Pours inky black with a thick, mocha-colored head. Ridiculous lacing and retention, the head refuses to disappear.
S - Notes of dark cocoa powder, vanilla, dark roasted malts and licorice. Smells like a dark chocolate truffle.
T - Dark malt and the darkest-of-dark chocolate dominate, with molasses, licorice, and dark stone fruits playing in there, too.
M - Thick and creamy with moderate carbonation. Coats your tongue and lasts forever on the palate.
D - Way too smooth for being 11% alcohol, my portion was gone quickly. 574 charactersjsanford, Oct 23, 2010

A: Black/Dark Brown with a surprisingly decent dark brown head. Quite viscous with a tiny bit of lacing and nice carbonation.
S: Coffee, chocolate, vanilla, anise and a slight aroma of oak and bourbon.
T: Almost all of the aroma comes through the same for the flavor. A punch of coffee, chocolate and anise with a nice warmth from the bourbon and a slight amount of oakiness that doesn't overwhelm. Amazingly balanced and not too over the top for anything.
M: Full mouthfeel but not overly viscous for a large stout.
D: Dangerously drinkable for the high ABV. 609 charactersantioch, Oct 20, 2010

A: Black as night. Dark brown, rust colored head. Some lacing and little islands of bubbles once it settles down.
S: A little stuffed up so mostly what I'm getting is some roasty, coffee aromas, a little bit of chocolate.
T: Sweet molasses and chocolate, a really awesome vanilla in there as well. Some alcohol but very rounded out.
M: Mouthfeel is medium but there's some lingering roastiness on the palate.
This is my third tasting of this beer and I'm having trouble remembering the others after tasting this. It's one of the tastiest stouts I've had in a while. Up there with Older Vis and Black Albert easily. 638 charactersjfunkk79, Oct 19, 2010

A: Beautiful opaque body with 1/2 inch of dark tan foam. Active carbonation continues long after pour and head settles down to about a quarter inch.
S: Initially, when cool, it was lots of coffee and dark chocolate. Then, as it warmed, the molasses, oak, bourbon, licorice and even some anise and a touch of vanilla came out.
T: The chocolate, coffee, licorice and molasses are wrapped up in a nice barrel-aged basket. The oak and bourbon are just right.There's a little heat also.
M: Very full mouthfeel--not quite DL-like but nice and full.

Now we all know what this beer is supposed to be, and what it usually is - a fiery hellhole of heat, sulfurous, viscous, with licorice intertwined with the wood from the barrels. It is black venom with dark brown spittle.
2009 Bottle - My first in a while, 2nd since the infection was reported
The loud pop augers the infection right away, the bubbles fizz and dissipate, the pour looks thinner, and the smell is of a tart and muted version of everything above. That said, this is one fantastic infection. To all lovers of wilds that had bottles blow, I am sorry. And to all stout lovers who venture not into the world of sour beers and poured theirs out, I again am sorry.
While I would still prefer the thick and angry Abyss to my funky one, I was not the least bit disappointed.
Score is a reflection of how I feel about the Abyss. Eagerly awaiting its triumphant return..
2010 Bottle - "sampled" 1/14/11
BEEEautiful, black with a tentacled brown head striving to swallow me from below. Chocolate, roast, molasses and alcohol aromas with some licorice in the background. And fuck, I just touched my nose after cutting a golden hot pepper. So now my nose is gone for the rest of this beer that I just opened. Who is this asshole? Thankfully I open beer at cellar temp. It's just proper to me.
Thicker than my solar cell textbook, but brutally efficient. Wow, actually, way less heat than usual for a fresh batch of Abyss. Kinda missing the brimstone. The thunder makes this beer. It's there in the back of the finish, but chocolate, molasses and wood dominate. Still damn good, but I need Satan smashing boulders in the back of my throat. 
Still awesome. I'm just so harsh on my boys..

Overall the beer is a mix of smooth, sweet chocolate with herbal lemon sour character. In the background there's toast, bitter black grains and more molasses in the aroma. I'm not always a huge fan of the style, as I find most of the beers to be heavy, and while tasting, uninteresting. This, however, is very quaffable, and enjoyable. This is a delicious and fun beer to drink. It has a balanced share of lambic character with an imperial stout background. 559 characterstempest, Oct 10, 2010

A - as dark as you'd expect a beer named The Abyss to be, but with a surprising inch of toffee-colored head on top. 
S - coffee and oak right away, then perhaps some chocolate truffle and caramel. Licorice is faint, but there.
T - somewhat bitter espresso, oak, vanilla, and truffle on the front. Smoother on the back, but with some hop dryness that's followed by a bit of bourbon/alcohol burn. 
M - very thick presence, good carbonation, but still a little hot.
D - this is a great brew, but it still needs more time. The alcohol is definitely there as well as some hop bitterness, but another year should give it exactly what it needs.
On a side note, there were a lot of infections reported for the '09 batch. This is the fourth I've had from my case and I'm very happy to say that none have been infected, so the rest will be put down for enjoyment over the next few years. 907 charactersGabrielM, Oct 05, 2010

A: Wow, what a great name for this brew. It looks dark, angry even, but with a cottony white head with light brown notes to bring out it's gentler side.
S: Molasses first, then raison, burnt roastiness, and of course high grade dark chocolate.
T: Very smooth for being the high octane monster that it is, and the thick oaked chocolate milk quality, along with the mild bitterness works its way into the palate in a very pleasant way.
M: Not hot in terms of ABV at all. For people who looking for a coffee style IS with that kind of bitterness, they need to look elsewhere. This one is pure molasses and God bless it for that!
D: Like I stated before, very smooth. When I got to the bottom of my glass, I actually wanted a bit more. 909 charactersChaney, Oct 05, 2010

A. Nice thick motor oil pour with a delicious foamy tan head. (Maybe a little too foamy...) Abyss is obviously a fitting name - this could blot out the sun.
S. As it warms, there is a tart cherry, tannic sourness that dominates the nose. It isn't offensive, but it is enough to hide some of the other components that can still be detected - oak, molasses, chocolate... I can almost imagine this without the sourness and it would have been great. 
T&M. At first, There is a lot of toasted oak, chocolate, burnt bitterness. Then, the vinous tart cherry kicks in. The change has affected the body as well, adding an effervescence that is at odds with the richness of the stout. It isn't that the tart fruity character is at all bad, it just doesn't combine well with the rest of what is happening here. 
D. I am confused. However, that keeps me coming back and trying to understand this incredibly complex beer. 
This bottle is infected. It is not a complete loss, but I am let down that it didn't age as it was supposed to. 1,105 charactersdougofthefuture, Oct 05, 2010
4.73/5  rDev +5.6%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I've now had The Abyss twice, first from the 2008 batch on-tap and second a 2009 Reserve in bottle (I'm keeping a second to age).
The Abyss is one of the best stouts I've ever had and is definitely deserving of its ranking as a top quality beer. The Abyss is one of the most beautiful pouring beers I've ever encountered. A thick, tan moon-scape like head forms with excellent retention, with beautiful lacing appearing well into the drink. The beer is a deep black with brown around the edges.
The Abyss is rich with strong notes of dark chocolate, roasted coffee and molasses. A sweet oaky finish from the portion of the Abyss aged in bourbon barrels really helps polish off The Abyss, and set it apart from many stouts of similar stature. As The Abyss warms the 11% ABV finally becomes apparent, and a pleasant warming boozy taste presents itself. 
I highly recommend this beer, take it slow, feel it out as it changes temperature, as the head dissipates, you'll probably agree with the hundreds of other reviewers giving this beer an A+ rating. 1,048 charactersmsmezher, Oct 05, 2010

Poured from a bottle into an imperial pint glass. This bottle was gotten due to a good friend of mine wanting to go to a CCB cask event and me taking his shift for him so he could attend. Im sure that will make it that much better.
A-pours an insane black that when help up to the light changes nothing. Never seen a beer this dark and the name fits. I very thick head in the shade of mocha with a rocky top is taking a while to melt. impressive do to the abv. The heal melts very slowly and leaves think sheets of bubbly lace.
S-The smell is very complex. Waves of dark chocolate and hints of coffee. Smells are cohesive and no alcohol is apparent. 
T-I cant express how much excitement built in writing the previous parts to this review and on the first taste I am AMAZED. I have had a number of highly ranked souts and the flavor of this only beets them by a small amount. But the best thing is that the balance is perfect. This bottle will reach its recommended consume after date next month but as of right now. The waves of dark chocolate and mild sweet coffee with hints of licorice even bits of oak. They all come together with perfect balance and without any other offputting flavors. EPIC.
M-mouthfeel is luxurious smooth and full. It has enough fullness to coat your mouth with complex flavor. Leaves no dryness or any funky after taste.

2009 vintage. Finally decided to bust this outta the fridge so's VDubb86 and I could determine if infection had set in. It pours a bulletproof onyx topped by over a finger of tan foam. No over-fizzing, which bodes well. The nose comprises blackened pretzels, light charcoal, anise, brown sugar, leather, and tobacco. No real sour notes in my 'strils, which, again, bodes well. The taste holds notes of cocoa powder, dark chocolate wedges, bourbon, oak, leather, charcoal, blackened biscuits, and a very slight tart edge pricking the tongue in the back, the only real sign of what appears to be a minor infection. Boo. It doesn't really detract from the proceedings, thankfully, more like a stronger version of the famous Guinness sour. The body is on the lighter side of hefty, with a light moderate carbonation and a fizzily chewy feel (which confirms the minor infection). Overall, I was definitely underwhelmed with this. Sure, the infection could have influenced things, but it seemed much too minor to really affect the overall package too much. Beyond the tartness, it just wasn't as incredible a stout as many had led me to believe. Oh well, it was still much more than decent, and I'm glad I was able to try it. 1,254 charactersTMoney2591, Sep 24, 2010

Thanks to TMoney2591 for sharing this beer with me.
This is the 2009 Vintage
It pours the black abyss that is its namesake. Affixed atop is a nice brown head that sticks around. The smell is of cocoa, bourbon, and a bit of sour. I know that there is infection problems with this beer, but there doesn't seem to be very strong and the lengthy refrigeration time seems to have kept it at bay. The taste is mainly of mocha at the very onset, but the strong bourbon flavor takes over. The good part is the bourbon isn't astringent at all and goes down as a very smooth portion of the beer. Other components of the flavor include licorice, butterscotch, char, and smoked oak. In addition to all of that there is an odd tartness to the back with is ruining the outstanding flavor. I can only assume that it is because of the infection that is peeking out after being kept at bay in the cold temperatures. That really ruined the mouthfeel for me. It is still very drinkable despite the high ABV. I'd recommend getting one, but don't overpay for a 2009. 1,070 charactersVdubb86, Sep 24, 2010

A - Pitch black, big rich head that looks like chocolate mousse.

M - Viscous and thick, also with a fair amount of carbonation so its not overly syrupy.
D- A great beer, would be quite the undertaking to drink more than one, finishing this one will signal its time to go to sleep for me.

Got this one from jhamel. Thanks, Bohdan!!
I have been waiting for months for the right time to open one of these and tonight, after brewing an imperial stout with gwuilliums and trying to drink an St. Bernardus Abt 12 (we have finally decided that Belgians are definitely not our thing), this was finally the night.
Poured from bottle into tulip.
A: Pours as black and oily as can be. Nice tan colored head. Very tiny carbonation bubbles. Exceptional looking stout.
S: Very slightly sour note on top of REALLY dark roast. I see now how the infection in the 2009 bottle I had would not be easily detected. Expecting the slightly sour nose that this beer has would mask it until it was too late.
T: Layer upon layer upon layer of dark roast and dark coffee and dark chocolate. Beyond deep in it's complexity. What a super tasting dark stout.
M: Perfectly creamy and carbonated.

Pours black as tar on a Georgia summer day. A thick, creamy 2" cocoa brown head. Oddly, it makes no sound while pouring. Great retention and leaves good lace behind.
Smell is chocolate, malt, coffee, smoke, peat, toffee and oak. Pretty good balance with the coffee a bit stronger than the rest.
Taste is malt, chocolate, coffee, peat, smoke, alcohol, oak and light molasses late. Great balance.
Thick, rich, creamy, chewy, smooth, full-bodied without being cloying. Extremely drinkable. Get one and consider sharing with a good friend.
Interestingly, it says it is brewed with licorice and molasses. Noticed little molasses and no licorice aywhere. Oh, well. 712 charactersPorterLambic, Sep 16, 2010

A - Possibly the most impressive looking stout I have seen. As close to black as you get, deep mocha 2 finger worth of head fades a little and sits like a pillow through the duration. The lacing left is beautiful, reminding me a little of Breakfast Stout.
S - Lots of licorice, hints of bourbon, smoky roasted malts, and dark chocolate, with an underlying sweetness. Not amazing, but good nonetheless.
T - More licorice and less bourbon to start. Intense roasted malts with a touch of smoke. A sweet dark chocolate emerges in the middle with a bold coffee and chocolate malt flavor in the end. The latter half of this taste is really good. The coffee and roasty flavors sit in the mouth until the next drink. Good overall.
M - Decent. Full bodied with little to no carbonation.. Sweet alcohol coats the mouth with each drink.
D - Not bad for 11%, but not great either. Wouldn't want to drink this one regularly, but glad I got to try it. 
I hope I get to try the 2010 version (without the chance of it being infected). I will revisit this beer at that time and review it again. Overall, I was somewhat disappointed with this one. I've had many better stouts... Then again, I wasn't wild about KBS either. 1,383 charactersBonis, Sep 13, 2010

A: Uh oh. This is definitely on the high end of carbonation for a stout, with the tulip winding up split halfway between fully black liquid and creamy, frothy brown foam. Pretty good retention and nice chunky lacing make this a great looking beer, even if the prevalence of carbonation makes me worry about bugs.
S: Well, it isn't a total sour mess, but I'm definitely getting some off notes (from what I expected). I'm getting lots of licorice up front, as well as bourbon and oak. Some fruitiness is there, but unfortunately it's more tart cherry than candied fig. It's weird - some inhalations yield lovely notes of chocolate, malt, vanilla, and licorice, while others are vinous, tannic, astringent, and tart. Man, this must be an amazing beer when it isn't slightly infected. Even so, it varies between great and mediocre, but is never bad.
T: Opens with sweet chocolatey malt, molasses, licorice, coffee, and bourbon - all amazing. The finish, though, brings the off flavors promised by the nose: red wine, tannin, and cherry. While the wine lover in me appreciates the vinous qualities of this beer, I really don't think that this is quite what The Abyss is supposed to taste like. Again, I can only imagine how good it must be when uninfected, since I'm really enjoying it as is.
M: The explosion of carbonation from the initial (soft) pour seems to have stripped the beer itself of all its life. At least it still has a nice full body, but without any effervescence to help clean things up. It gets pretty darn sticky.
D: Part of me is loving drinking this beer, since there are just so many variables in its flavor and aroma profiles - if complexity alone is a virtue, then this beer definitely deserves high praise. Some sips seems perfectly stout-y, and then others are overbearingly astringent. One thing worth noting is that alcohol is remarkably absent from the picture, almost unbelievably so for an 11% beer. It is doing a great job of warming me up on a cool day, though.
Notes: I don't really know how I feel about this one - while I'm obviously disappointed that my first experience with this legendary beer was less than transcendent, I'm still having a great time exploring its complexities - even the unintended ones. I do hope that my other bottle of 2009 is pristine, but my heart isn't broken to have gotten a bottle that's slightly off. Now if I can just convince Hopstoopid120 to include me in the party when he does his full Abyss vertical...
Cheers! 2,627 characterswoosterbill, Sep 12, 2010
4.67/5  rDev +4.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 22 oz. bottle into an oversized wine glass. 2009 Vintage. With the rumors of some 2009 bottles being infected I didn't want to let this one sit any longer.
a - Pours a dark, dark black color with two inches of brown head and moderate carbonation. Little bit of head retention for a few minutes and a small amount of lacing.
s - Smells of coffee, roasted malts, licorice, chocolate, vanilla, bourbon, and dark fruits. Smells amazing and well balanced. This bottle is definitely not infected.
t - Tastes of coffee, licorice, roasted malts, oak, bourbon, dark fruits, and chocolate. A littke bit of vanilla as well. Very enjoyable.
m - Full body and low carbonation. A thick, smooth stout that is very easy to drink considering the 11% ABV.
d - Overall I thought this was a great stout. I thought it smelled amazing and I enjoyed every aspect of this beer. I was really glad this one wasn't infected and look forward to drinking more of it. 956 charactersmdfb79, Sep 12, 2010

I've read talk about infected versions of this beer. 2 bottles, no noticeable infection. 
Smell - Molasses. Both bottles. Both tasting experiences. 
Taste - Chocolate, vanilla, oak. Molasses with some oak and alcohol in the finish. I love the complexity. 
Drinkability - The 22oz bottle wasn't enough. I want more. Yeah, the this is beer geek heaven for most. But me, well yeah. It's heaven. 410 charactersobireidkenobi, Sep 10, 2010
4.66/5  rDev +4%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Have had every batch of this beer. This review comes from my 2008 notes on the 2007 batch. This beer lives up to the hype. Pours like motor oil with a large, tight, dark brown head that leaves tons of lacing covering a pitch black body. Aroma has lots of rich chocolate, vanilla, some oak, and licorice. Taste is amazing. Like drinking slightly bitter chocolate syrup. Very mouth-coating. Slightly burnt, but very rich and full with vanilla and licorice notes. I love it! 471 charactersBMan1113VR, Sep 09, 2010

Pours a nice deep black with a thin head that lingers awhile leaving just a bit of lacing.
It has a nice roasty smell with chocolate, coffee, molasses, bourbon, licorice.
The taste was excellent. It followed the nose and showed exceptional balance. Just the right amounts of bourbon, molasses, and licorice to gow ith the roasted malts. This beer shows why it is so highly rated.
It was thick and smooth with light carbonation.
This was a lovely stout and I did drink it slowly, but it certainly wasn't a chore to drink. I finished the whole bottle and started thinking of how I could trade for more when I was finished. 638 charactersBigTomZ, Sep 08, 2010

A: Black with a thin dark brown hue, a nice chocolate constant head.
S: The smell is interesting; cheesy/moldy, red wine, dark chocolate, oak, a strong fruitiness (banana and dark berries), slight caramel. Bordering sour... or is that the brewer's licorice? Either way, I like it.
T: Milky chocolate turning into roasted and then burnt espresso and apple cores (?!) with a lingering roast. What a ride!
M: Heavier, but with a nice creamy frothiness.
D: Pretty good for an imperial stout.
I'm not sure if this is borderline sour, or just the strong brewer's licorice getting to me. I like it, either way. A lot. 670 charactersne0m00re, Sep 08, 2010
4.1/5  rDev -8.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.52009 bottle, big thanks to Matt. Pours black with a deep mocha head that settles to a fine lacing. Nose is a tight collage of dark malt, bourbon, ash, and vanilla. A bit of coffee creeps into the flavor, which is focused on the ash with a light bourbon backing. Fairly bitter in the finish. This is a nice, refined package. I'm still trying to get the taste of the horrid Mikkeler Black Hole (Red Wine) out of my mouth, which was a drain pour and a lost $14. This serves the purpose, and it's quite a good imperial stout without any blaring features but quite a nice, balanced package for the style. 599 charactersJAXSON, Sep 07, 2010
3.61/5  rDev -19.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3 |  overall: 4The infamous 2009. Unfortunately, I don't have any prior Abyss experience, so I'll just have to compare against what I think it should taste like. 
Pours a deep black, good frothy crema-type head with a lot of staying power. 
Hmmm. In the aroma, there is a *little* tart cherry/grape. I get the typical chocolate, coffee roast aroma too. Depending on the whiff, it's like it's 2 different beers. 
Taste-wise, the slight infection seems to make this a schizophrenic beer. At first, tasted at a fairly cool temperature, I don't find much evidence of infection at all - there's a lot of roasted coffee, charry-type flavors with an undercurrent of licorice. As it warmed a bit, then I started tasting some bitter crushed aspirin flavors that I felt were way out of place in this beer. Then as it warmed further, licorice and roast returned, along with a little tart cherry at the back end. It is complex, no doubt about that...but it does seem to be showing some signs of infection. 
It's the mouthfeel where the bugs are most apparent, IMO. Again, while I don't have experience with prior year bottles of Abyss, I'm pretty sure it's supposed to be somewhat thicker and less light/effervescent. It did not have big-beer feel - the body was closer to that of a Jolly Pumpkin-esque wild ale. Maybe I'm exaggerating it a bit, it's not quite *that* light yet, but it seems to be heading in that direction. I'm fairly sure this beer isn't supposed to be like that. 
The lightened body and dry finish probably help make this easier to drink, to an extent. In any event, the beer isn't so badly infected yet that you wouldn't be able to drink it. I could see finishing off the bomber without too much trouble. 1,703 charactersPatrick999, Sep 06, 2010

Appears an inky black with a small tan head that fades into a tiny cap. Spotty bits of lacing are left around the glass.
Smell s of cocoa, vanilla, ripe fruit, mild booze, brown sugar, roasted grains, and concord grapes.
Taste is of the aromas with standout ripe fruit, chocolate milk, molasses, anise, dark rum, and bourbon.
Mouthfeel is full bodied, sugary, chewy, boozy, and outright delicious. Molasses sweetness resounds in the finish. 495 charactersweeare138, Sep 05, 2010

Yup this is infected. i can only smell it lightly,but it is easily recognizable and differant from what the last bottle of Abyss i drank was like, but it's not ruining the smell at least, more or less adding another element to the aroma. The only downer to it is it is making me want to drink a sour now, but i have a stout in my glass, it's making me salavate expecting tartness...Nope.
Aroma is where the licorice is strongest for me, and it's a positive addition i think, adds something interesting to really make this something differant. some roasty malts and warming alcohol that stops short of being hot. 
Flavors are sorta like the aroma but there is some creamy vanilla flavors, and i am tasting some light off sour notes, nothing to ruin the bottle, but it is for sure putting a slight damper on it, as the finish is a bit dryer then i expected, interesting because this is pretty viscous. I can't say off the top of my head i've had a stout close to the impression of this one, at least in this lightly-infected state.
Feel is nice and viscous, i keep going back and forth between medium thick & just thick...i guess it's medium thick thick. Carbination is slightly strong for the style, maybe from the infection, or maybe otherwise. nice feel in any case.
This was still a good beer with the infection, it would have been interesting to try this infected bottle with another year or two for the little guys to work, just for fun, since it's only lightly working it's presence right now. But it is better in it's un-infected form. 1,637 charactersChadQuest, Sep 02, 2010
4.03/5  rDev -10%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 42009 Vintage...is it infected or not? Poured from 22oz bottle into a snifter.
Appearance: Pitch black body with a finger of mocha-tan head that settles to a thin layer for the rest of the drink. 
Smell: Dark chocolate, roasted malt, slight oak, some licorice....and some sour cherry on the nose (infection or the cherry bark that they use, I don't know!). 
Taste: Roasted malt, dark chocolate, some coffee, some oak....also a faint hint of sour cherry, not enough to make this bad, but definitely takes away from my expectations (and what I think this truly could be, still really tasty though). 
Mouthfeel: Full bodied and creamy. 
Drinkability: Even with some "flaws" this is a very enjoyable beer that I will be looking for some 2010 Vintage when it comes out. 768 charactersAxic10, Sep 02, 2010

A: Big dense mocha head. Healthy espresso appearance. Fat globs of sticky lacing. Thick opaque used motor oil. A gentle swirl gives up a thick head. Time take sit away but still some remains. 
S: Lots of oak and cocoa, some warming alcohol and sweet prunes. Vanilla and other fruity esters in the back ground. Molasses makes its self known if you look for it. 
T: A melody of oak, vanilla, chocolate, and bourbon. Warming alcohol on the finish as it warms. A faint astringent taste is there as well.
M: Thick viscous liquid that is full and plummy. Good carbonation for the style.
D: A great sipper. I went a little quick with it but something good to have at the end of the day. Some more age will help this one out I think. 802 charactersrwf08, Aug 30, 2010
4/5  rDev -10.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5Serving type - Bottle
APpearance - Dark black, dark tan head
Smell - Coffee, smoke, whiskey malts and barley
Taste - Bottle aged about 1 year. Starts out coffee and chocolate, then the smokey whiskey flavor mixed with alcohol hits with the malts. 
Mouthfeel - Starts out smooth, but the alcohol warms up your mouth quite a bit. You are ruined a bit after drinking this, eat something to get the pallette cleaned up. 
Drinkabilty - Being so strong at 11% i honestly wouldnt want to drink the whole 22 oz bottle myself. I was a little disapointed in this beer cause the smoked whiskey flavor is overpowering to me and takes away from all the beer has. I would like to try this again fresh but i for sure am not going to spend 25-30$ for this. 745 characterswvsabbath, Aug 28, 2010

Dark like Fight Club, just damn dark. First whiff - coffee, roasts, chocolate, licorice. Hence the name, Abyss basically takes your palate to the deepest, darkest recesses of the flavor planet. I mean its like a machine gun of bitter/dar chocolate, coffee, and dark caramel. Man, this is just a good beer its ridiculous. This, a piece of chocolate cake from Bar Tartine, man, in heaven. Drinkability? Well, lets say if you can drink more than 1 and be "okay," I'd like to shake your hand. 534 charactersteamizm, Aug 28, 2010
4.16/5  rDev -7.1%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 3On tap at Whole Foods, usually I never have beers on tap but, come on, the Abyss?
Pours black. Not dark brown, not really darky dark dark..
Black, as in I can see my reflection in this thing. Obsidian. Never seen a beer this dark before. Lovely light caramel head. Lacing will not die. One of the best I've ever seen.
Smells pungent, chocolate, bitter coffee, malt, smokiness and vanilla.
Tastes like the smell with the bitterness taking a prominent role. Chocolate and alcohol heat in there as well. The creamy chocolate is what makes this beer shine though. The barrel aging doesn't really come through, no burnt flavors but definitely roastiness. 
Mouthfeel is absolutely top notch, so smooth and creamy. When it's swished in the mouth it tastes like a smoothie.
Due to the aforementioned bitter flavors I am hesitant to rate this high in the drinkability dept. Also the alcohol isn't really too subtle in this one. I was surprised at the seemingly low 11%. 965 charactersptykozoon, Aug 26, 2010
4.92/5  rDev +9.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5There is really not much more to say about this beer, it deserves its place on BA's top ten list then some.
Wax sealed bottle, pours black as coal with a deep brown head (assuming you don't accidentally get wax in the glass... ooops).
 Smell is a strong chocolate and coffee (stout) smell, with notes of a honey and something I couldn't quite place (other reviews have said "Dark Fruit" that is a close as I can come to a description)
Taste... Wow, starts with a strong coffee taste quickly followed by subtle notes of sweet syrup, spices (i picked up cinnamon but my fellow tasters said i was crazy) and the aforementioned "dark fruit" finishes out with an oaky/smoky taste you would expect from an aged stout. Overall a great blend of flavors.
Mouth feel was creamy without the burn that can occur in imperial stouts. 
Drink ability goes down smooth enough that you can finish your glass with out even realizing. Like a good Italian wine you don't feel a thing until you stand up. I would gladly drink it all night long... and the hang over would be well worth it. 1,072 charactersbaronvonotocon, Aug 22, 2010

A- Incredibly dark, a dark head rests on a midnight base beer. 1cm head that lingers.
S- Intense! Roasty coffee, honey, maple syrup and dark fruit.
T- Mammoth. Roasted malts, bitter chocolate and fresh-pressed coffee. An assault on the tastebuds. Smoky/ashy and bitter. 
M- Thick, smooth, silky. Sublime. Flavors wear out the tongue quickly though.
D- Low but damn is this a good beer. I'd drink it again. 
Note- I had the 09 version and while not too many signs of it being infected I didn't like it nearly as much- lacking in flavor and body compared to the 08 vintage. 627 charactersShogoKawada, Aug 21, 2010
4.62/5  rDev +3.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Reviewed Aug 18/10
A big thank you to my buddy Gregg for picking up this 2007 vintage last year for me while on a trip to the States.
This review is hopefully going to be a good one for me as it's my 32nd birthday and 100th beer review. I'm excited, so lets see what we have.
A- The pour is a thick impenetrable tar black. A good fingers width of head that seems just as thick as the body. Not much lace to speak of but a bold and powerful appearance non the less. This is the darkest and most viscous stout I've had to date.
S- Oh wow, I could just keep my nose stuck in this without ever having a sip. The licorice is definitely noticeable from my first wiff. Such a deep and dark roastiness to this, I can't think of anything that would compare. Everything is here that they describe, oak, bourbon, and molasses. There's a good amount of smoke & chocolate as well that just meld everything together beautifully. 
T - initial tastes of roasted malts, chocolate & molasses and then out of nowhere a strong smoky/oaky flavor appear and met with a rich bourbon flavored finish. The licorice is lurking in the background throughout. I couldn't notice the alcohol at all in my first glass, but the heat is there although what do you expect for 11% abv. The smoke and oak really took over after half the bottle was done, but in an enjoyable way. So much going on for an Imperial Stout.
M- Definitely not as full bodied as you might think after seeing the pour. So smooth for such a big beer. Low carbonation and it really coates the mouth .
D- It's a shame that more people can't enjoy something this good. Believe the hype, this is a very special beer and thanks to my buddy I've got 1 more left in the cellar. I'm not much of a smoker, but a cigar is calling my name with the last couple of sips. 1,801 charactersDawkfan, Aug 19, 2010

And I wonder, still I wonder, who'll stop the rain
Seriously...stop raining
Gearing up for the Great Taste of the Midwest and I've desired some contemplation time with this beer. I've had the 09' twice in all it's infected glory and popped this 09' with fingers crossed.
Nearly opaque with faint ruby highlights along the edges into my snifter. Massive mocha fluff provides full surface coverage and leaves the glass an oily, sticky, ruinous mess. Really a gorgeous pour.
Disconcertingly, the initial scent is the tart yeasty Rodenbach clone hovering over the base of the beer. Thankfully, and correspondingly oddly, this scent comes and goes. Early stage infection? Uncertain. Repeated small hard pours yield much of what is good here: ice cream, mocha, oak, sweet rich malt, cherry and molasses. 
Taste is vanilla, mocha, cherry, and a mild tannic presence from the barrel. Bourbon is quite mellow and there is a continual interplay between the sweetness and the roast that goes back and forth throughout. Upon warming, the sweetness becomes more dominant and the coffee more pronounced.
What this beer lacks in body, near medium, it more than makes up for with the soft carbonation and near pillowy mouthfeel, which worked best before reaching room temperature. 1,317 charactersBarrytheBear, Aug 14, 2010

A: Deep tan head, with a black, cloudy body. Excellent body. This is a crowd pleaser.
S: The powerful aroma holds notes of chocolate, and some strong nuts.
T/M: A full bodied mouthfeel and taste, with malt notes of caramel. shows notes from the casking process. Again high intensity.
D: A bit heavy to get great drinkability, but this brew has it all so for the ABV and the intensity, toss it out the window, this beer is the best. 489 charactersGDBEERMAN, Aug 12, 2010

Happy to report no infection here! Thanks to abecall98 for this bottle.
Dark black pour, duh! The head is light brown with some off white lacing that sticks around for a while. The smell almost exhibits some sour notes (or is my mind playing tricks on me?) Otherwise getting the dark malt, coffee and some spice from the licorice.
No sour in the taste at all. Strong roasted nut flavors with hints of vanilla. This was chilled for a short time before opening, but the flavors are improving as it sits out. the creaminess and velvety mouthfeel that I look for in big stouts is spot on.
This version is still a little hot as it was opened 2 months before best by date. It seems the carbonation is still at work. I will save my other bottles and expect an even better result.
Drinkability through the roof for the style that is! Shared with a friend and wanted more for sure. 907 charactersjstilwell, Aug 10, 2010
4.52/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Tonight I opened a bottle of the potentially infected '09 Abyss...
As soon as I opened the bottle there was a flash-bang and a vile purplish-green ooze began erupting. I tried in vain to put my hand over the bottle in the hope that I might contain it, but it started burning my flesh intensely. 
The chemical burns, coupled with the noxious gases that were seeping from it caused me to lose consciousness. 
Thankfully, I was standing at the top of a flight of stairs; I fell all the way down the stairs after losing consciousness and that was what saved me from being injured from the resulting flash fire that occurred upon my dropping of the bottle. 
Several people on that storey of the apartment building were injured by the caustic spray emanating from the smoldering ruptured Abyss geyser, but it was nothing that will require extended hospitalization. 
All in all, I'd say everyone got very lucky.
OR
It was delicious. Not at all infected, at least this bottle...
A - Black and evidently rich with ample mocha froth; a swirl of the glass brings a swath more.
S/T - Initially I get impressions of chocolate and some coffee, very small traces of barrel, its a tad sharp and perhaps could use a bit of mellowing time, though the risk that a bottle could be infected makes aging more perilous. As it airs out the flavors meld sublimely and hints of cherry, vanilla and a rich decadence from the oak open up.
M/D - This is a luxurious sipper; it is not the thickest in terms of viscosity, but it makes up for it with more-than-ample velvety creaminess. 1,564 charactersktrillionaire, Aug 10, 2010

A: The pour is a viscous elixir, nearly black in color with a solid finger's worth of mocha head.
S: A wonderful combination of roasted malts, licorice, coffee, and sweet, creamy chocolate. A few notes of oak, vanilla, and maybe even dark molasses.
T: Lots and lots of chocolate and roasted malts up front. There is a subtle woody character that comes through nicely, along with a hint of bourbon, vanilla, and licorice. Wonderfully balanced between the sweet and roast/bitter flavors.
M: The body is silky, smooth, and creamy with a low-ish level of carbonation.
D: This is probably my favorite vintage of Abyss, and with good reason. So many great flavors and so easy to drink. It's really too bad this year's developed an infection. 875 characterswomencantsail, Aug 10, 2010

S: lots going on in here. I first get vanilla, choc, molasses, carmel. Then as it warmed I was I was oddly reminded of a dark belgian with fruits and yeast. Then I got a little bourbon and oak after that. 
T: After I let my glass warm up to proper temp...I taste a fair amount of vanilla right away followed by some caramal and a nice oaky flavor. A small burning pinch on the way down. Not tasting the licore that its brewed with though. Still a great beer. Definitley softer then I expected. After it warmed more I taste a belgian like tartyness. This is not appropriate for this style...
M: nice. A little thinner than expected. But still decent.
D: great for a big imperial stout. More subtle than I thought. 
Thoughts*
Well, I have been hearing rumors of an unwanted sour taste in this beer...turns out in my tasting notes that belgian tarty yeast flavor is not supposed to be there :( I did find it very odd in this style...now I know why... 1,027 charactersGOGRANDE, Aug 07, 2010
3.45/5  rDev -23%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 22009 Vintage.
Pours a dark near-black body with a deep brown head. Good head and decent lacing.
Nose is of roasted malt, a hint of chocolate, smoke, and licorice. Taste brings much of the same. Roasty flavor with a healthy dose of anise/licorice and oak. All in all, I found the flavor profile to be rough around the edges. I didn't enjoy it, but I would be interested in trying an aged version of this. Mouthfeel is good.
All in all, I didn't enjoy this bottle and it took me hours to drink. But, to be fair, I think that may be my fault - I opened it before the best by date. This is from the '09 vintage, which has developed a reputation for being infected - however, I did not notice any problems with this bottle. I simply didn't care much for it. I'll have to try an aged bottle some time. 798 charactersMavajo, Aug 07, 2010
4.55/5  rDev +1.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Another major storm in 2010 left us in the dark here in Arlington. For the snowstorm I opened something special (my first KBS), so for this one I decided to open something special as well. 2008 vintage poured from a 22oz bottle into my Portsmouth tulip. Poured a thick black color with a moderate mocha head filling a half inch of the glass. Decent head retention and lacing overall. 
The aroma shows a good amount of chocolate flavor along with some roasted malts. A little bit of the oak comes through and seems to smooth out the flavors a bit. I get some of the molasses I think but don't seem to get much of the licorice. Very good aroma overall.
The taste starts off with more bitter-sweet chocolate, smooth characteristic to it. By the time the finish comes around more of a bold, roasted, burnt, bitter flavor is present and lingers after the finish. The roasted and bitter flavors definitely smoothed out a bit after it warmed. The licorice and molasses started to come through just a bit as it warmed as well. It shows both sweet and bitter flavors well throughout and they balance each other very nicely. Very smooth overall for the strength and size of this beer. It's tough to not give this a 5 on taste, I'm not sure what else I could ask for in an imperial stout. 
The mouthfeel is definitely one of the thicker imperial stouts I've had, but not quite as thick as Dark Lord. Carbonation is on the lower side which I also like. Great mouthfeel overall for my tastes. Drinkability is very good, it had some fantastic flavors to it and was very well balanced between the sweet chocolaty and the roasted bitterness. Excellent beer overall and an excellent choice to drink by candle light in my dark powerless house. 1,728 charactersbillab914, Aug 06, 2010

The taste is amazing, it is big, sweet and loaded with roasted malts, lots of dark cherry notes, coffee, molasses, oak tannins, lots of licorice and a nice bitter extremely anise like resin coating my mouth with lots of really interesting layers ranging from pine, oak, java, roasted malts, and burnt oak. The mouthfeel is really amazing. All of the resiny goodness of this beers just dances through my palate and makes me want and take another sip. I really enjoyed my '09 Abyss, I saw no signs of infection and really hope my other bottle is as clean. Overall this is an extremely aggressive beer with a lot nuances that will most likely become more present with age. 885 charactersnas5755, Aug 05, 2010

S- Coffee, Licorice, molasses, with a great roasted nose and hints of vanilla, oak, and bourbon.
T- Dark roasted malts hit you up front followed by a bunch of complex flavors. Strong bitter coffee, sweet dark fruits, bittersweet chocolate, and a slight alcohol finish that brings out the bourbon and oak.

4.83/5  rDev +7.8%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Shared this beer with some friends during our epic imperial stout tasting with Surly Darkness, Darklord, Kate the Great, Abyss, Sexual Chocolate, Cigar City 110K OT Batch2, Speedway stout, Stormaktsporter regular and Kaggen! in the line-up.
Looks: Like a real RIS should look like. Very very dark with a brown thick fluffy head.
Smell: espresso, molasses, dark chocolate, dark fruits, some hints of alcohol, wood (oak) and bourbon
Taste: Most components of the smell come back in the taste. Bit sweet in the beginning, but bitterness (roasted malts) in the end. Alcohol is slightly noticeable. Perfect balance.
Mouthfeel: chewy body, but so silk and smooth...damm, perfect! Medium-low carbonation
Overall: What a fantastic beer. This is one very well balanced American Beauty!! Came 3rd in our beertasting after the magical stormaktsporters, but let's be honest, loosing from the best Imperial stouts on the planet is still an achievement! Lives up the hype! 963 charactersrvdoorn, Aug 03, 2010
5/5  rDev +11.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Sampled from a 22oz bottle in a DFH snifter. Purchased during a business trip to WA around Jan 2010 and stored at a steady 50 degrees since. 
A - Jet black with no light passing through at all. Pours like motor oil. A surprisingly large and robust tan head that lingers for a while. Wow.
S - A complex blend of chocolate, licorice, coffee and a hint of fruit. 
T - Rich and complex but smooth and balanced. There are just so many flavors yet they all work together. Chocolate, licorice, molasses and a hoppy bitterness lead for me but there are so many layers. And it only gets better as it warms. An increasing warming effect takes over as you empty the glass.
M - Thick and chewy yet light and airy with a nice low carbonation.
D - I've heard some nightmares about infected bottles but I've had several and all have been superb. This is a fantastic beer with lots and lots of character. I've only got one more and I'm already regretting not picking up more when I had the chance. If there's any question that aging can make certain beers better, this is the proof. 1,071 charactersGJ40, Aug 01, 2010

A - Pours as black as night; completely opaque with no chance for any light to even think about getting through this one. A lovely burnt caramel colored, one finger head forms with a lovely cascading effect inviting me in to the beer.
S - Roasted malts, chocolate and licorice up front. Tons of vanilla ans super strong woody aromas. No sign of infection so far. Getting some dark fruits as well. The molasses isn't quite as dominant in the nose as I thought it would be.
T - Smokey char, ashy, roasted deliciousness hits up front. No infection at all!! Wood, oak, and vanilla follow behind the first wave of flavors with a solid molasses-y sugar kick at the end of the palate. Quite a complex beer. Not getting a lot of the licorice in the taste, but there's just enough to let you know it is there. 
M - Honestly, for a beer like this, I thought it was a little thin; BUT it is still a heavy big beer. Smooth and creamy with just the slightest bit of carbonation. As it warms, the carbomation subsides and you are left with a lovely velvet rolling across your palate. Coats the mouth quite well.
D - Incredibly drinkable. After each sip, I immediately wanted to go back for more to see what other flavors were there. I didn't even notice the alcohol as I made my way through this monster. 1,409 charactersKAP1356, Aug 01, 2010
4.57/5  rDev +2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5From the infamous 2009 batch.
Pours black with an awesome tan head with a beautiful cascade. This is an appropriately named beer. The Abyss, indeed.
Smells like licorice up front followed by smoke, bacon, oak, Bourbon, and some sweetness. I could curl up inside the empty bottle and take a nap.
Taste follows the nose. Licorice up front, smoke, oak, figs, and maple. This is one of the most complex beers I've ever had.
The feel is slightly lighter than I would like for the style. Still creamy, though.
This is an insanely drinkable beer. Lots of depth of flavor. I declare this bottle uninfected. 603 charactersRomaniIteDomum, Jul 30, 2010
3.13/5  rDev -30.1%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3 | feel: 2.5 |  overall: 3The dreaded 2009 sour vintage....
Appearnace:
This bottle has a very simple yet classy looking label with a wax dipped neck preventing any oxygen from getting into the bottle creating spoilage. As I finish up checking out the label I noticed they have a little piece of information on the side of the bottle that I never saw before, a "best after" date which says 11/16/2010. That's really interesting to see on a beer because usually you see "best before" dates telling to to consume the beer while it's still fresh and this is telling me to cellar this beer to attain optimum flavors. I had to get a knife out to pry off a small slice of wax before I could get my bottle opener under the lip of the cap which was a mild pain in the butt. After the cap was removed I got a healthy sounding hiss noise and no gushing which was a good sign so far that there wasn't any infection. I pulled out my Victory snifter and gave this beer a healthy straight on pour and was welcomed with a nice mocha caramel colored two finger thick head which hung around for quite awhile. When I hold the glass up to the light all I can see is black murky midnight with no light shining through and a medium amount of lacing sliding down the walls.
Smell:
On the nose I am pulling out loads chocolate, and woody barrel aging with vanilla. The large amount of dry roast is there too almost like a freshly made Starbucks hot coffee with loads of molasses thrown in. I am not getting any sour or lactic aromas witch is yet another good sign that this is not infected, I guess I am feeling lucky today! In the finish I'm also pulling out a fair amount of prunes and figs that have been chard over a campfire.
Taste:
Hmm...maybe I spoke too soon. The smell is much better than the taste at this point, surprisingly this beer is very thin and not quite like I remembered. There is a tinge of sourness lingering around which is not off putting but yet its not typical or expected in this style. I can pull out some bakers chocolate and a slight amount of woody undertones but over all this beer just isn't right. As I trudge on through this beer I am noticing some licorice that adds a small amount of spiciness to the complexity. I can sense some vanilla, and chard ashy taste but I keep coming back to the tartness in the finish and as I kept going it seemed to get worse and worse on my palate.
Drinkability:
Overall, I am a little bit disappointed by this beer. I really thought that I was going to escape from the infection that everyone was talking about. As I finished up the bottle it became harder and harder to drink because I really could pick out the lactic funky taste. For a future reference I will be searching out other vintages of this beer because a lot of people have had great things to say about it and I would love to know how it taste fresh. If you come across this beer in any other vintage you should definitely give it a try and let me know what you think, as for the 2009 version all I can say is that you are taking a gamble on getting a bogus bottle 3,056 charactersBmoyer0301, Jul 29, 2010
4.23/5  rDev -5.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured into my SN XXX glass, this stout pours a midnight black with an exceptionally dark head. Still not the darkest stout with the darkest head I've seen, that is why this brew gets a 4.5
S: The aroma is a little less satisfying as far as complexity goes, but is loaded with molasses and very dark chocolate. 
T: The flavor is amazing. I'm really happy with this stout, and glad Descutes decided to brew a real RIS and not over load it with espresso or oatmeal. Don't get me wrong, I like espresso in my stouts, but at times it gets redundant. Overall, the flavor of the Abyss has a very chocolate and molasses kick. My gripe is that it's hard to sense the bourbon.
MF/D: The mouth feel IMO should be a little bigger for this brew. It's drinkability to is a little less satisfying. It is smooth, it is tasty, but it does warm you up a little bit.
Overall, I would like to thank strikertown for the trade. He is an excellent trader, and has been patient while I work out my broken package with FedEX. Thanks again man~! 1,024 charactersTKEbeerman, Jul 29, 2010

3.62/5  rDev -19.2%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 2.5 |  overall: 3My brother and I decided we should crack this one due to all the recent reports of this beer being infected. So, I'm drinking the 2009 vintage which my brother graciously poured into a tulip for me. Pours with a big three finger head atop a pitch black body. Lots of large bubbles in this tan head. Smell is a chocolatey nose with a very faint hint of barrel aging. Darks malts shadow a subtle sweet aroma of molasses. The smell is good, but I feel like I really have to take big whiffs to get anything out of it. Everything just seems a bit faint. So i'll go ahead and say it now. I don't think I have an infected bottle. This taste pretty nice. A big bitter espresso taste to this one. The flavors are on, but I feel like I'm not getting as much out of the taste as I did the nose. It finishes with an oaky bourbon taste and leaves me to scrape the roof of my mouth with my tongue. It reminds me of an amateur french press where coffee grinds are left in the last sip. The finish burns a little bit, but bourbon aging and eleven percent makes this not surprising. Not the best mouthfeel but the carbonation is very nice and this sips nicely in front of the Red Sox. 1,167 charactersBendurgin, Jul 25, 2010
4.74/5  rDev +5.8%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Following review written by Wiseman Justin.
Ignore the scores you see above, I did that to trick the system into giving this bear a 4.6. Screw you beer advocate for giving us the weakest rating system possible.
Went out of my way to go back to Deschutes for the 09' Abyss on tap. Why? Because it's an epic beer.
Appearance: 4.0
I want to give this a higher score but I can't. The head is a nice mocha color perfect for the style. It's black, like darkness sure.. opaque as hell. But the head is wimpy and small, maybe one finger. The lacing is non-existent just like the head retention.
Smell: 4.75
Spot on and bravo. Bourbon, chocolate, wood, and coffe on first impression. Very boozy but in the best kind of way. This is a complex beer, I get dark hints of fruit and molassess and vanilla.
Taste: 4.75
I was initially unimpressed, can you imagine that. Then wisdom sent me caution in the form of a backhand. Why am I drinking this beer so cold. So I waited, and ordered another. When it's cold all you taste is carbonation and a slight burning. When it's warm you get the real deal; liquid heaven. Smoke, wood, and bouron are here hanging out with chocolate and Mr. Coffee Bean. Vanilla is riding on bourbon's shoulders. Ash is over in the corner playing halo. They all greet you like old friends. Do not drink cold or you will be a big fat loser.
Mouthfeel: 4.75
I feel stuck in 4.75 mode. This beer does everything almost as good as perfect, but never quite perfect. It's like in Nascar, you can get second place in every race but win the entire thing in the end. This is a perfect mix of creamy and ashy. Once it warms up the carbonation really really mellows out; truly remarkable 
Drinkability: 4.75
I'm just going to order another one.. only one more I promise. Actually funny story my friends tried to leave and I just snuck back into the place and ordered another one. Then they all did... Good times. 1,923 charactersThreeWiseMen, Jul 25, 2010
4.5/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Tasting the 2009. 
Pours very dark, with an ample head that dissipates into a fine layer of foam. Leaves lots of clingy lacing. 
Aromas of sour cherries, raisins, chocolate, and coffee. Complex and intriguing. 
There are flavors of dark bitter baker's chocolate, raisins, sour cherries, charred malt, and hops. There is a bit of a sweet and sour thing going on (raisins versus cherries). Tastes just a little pasty in the finish, kind of like chocolate pudding, and then has a long dry hoppy chocolate taste sensation. 
Body is thick and the fine head and carbonation gives it a very creamy mouthfeel. 
This is a huge beer, and very drinkable. I think the '09 version is just a little more sour than previous vintages. I had this at a tasting in April 2010, when it was noticeably more sour than the '08. However, 3 months later, this bottle selected randomly from my cellar collection of 10 bottles, is tasting the same. Whether the extra sourness was intended, I don't know. Sometimes changes occur as a brewery doubles its volume of production. 
I'll try another bottle in 3 mos and see if it has changed, but I think it is not infected, just a slightly more sour version. 1,181 charactersBeerenauslese, Jul 24, 2010
4.21/5  rDev -6%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Big thanks to BigTomZ for this one! 2009 Vintage, this one was mildly infected. Served from bottle into a Stone nonic. Pours black with a massive tan head that remains throughout. Maintains phenomenal lacing throughout. The aroma was comprised of malt and a tart note (first sign of infection). The flavor was of syrup, licorice, malt, and a slight tart taste (also due to infection). It was medium on the palate with low carbonation. Overall this was a nice beer even though it was infected. Goes down smooth regardless of that fact as well. Would love to try a non-infected bottle to be able to give it a true rating of its capabilities (hint hint traders...) 661 charactersthagr81us, Jul 23, 2010

4.35/5  rDev -2.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Vintage: 2009, NOT infected!
Appearance -- Pours a deep, rich brown, black in the glass, with a thin tan fog over the liquid line. Extra points for having a constant head, thin as it may be.
Smell -- Mild bourbon and oak, rich dark malt, prune and sweet cherries, faint cocoa and coffee.
Taste -- Not quite as sweet as the nose would suggest: baker's chocolate, raisin and prune, black strap molasses. The bourbon and oak notes are pitch-perfect; they don't overwhelm the base, but accentuate the wonderful flavors therein. The licorice adds a pointed spicy note toward the finish.
Mouthfeel -- Medium to full in body, not as full as I would have liked but it didn't detract from the experience. Carbonation is medium to high in volume and prickly.
Drinkability -- I was planning on letting this sit a while longer, but all of the threads discussing the infection made me get to this one sooner than expected. I don't know if I just happened to get a good bottle, or if the infection is too weak to notice.
Recent quality issues aside, Abyss deserves all of the accolades it has been bestowed. Great depth of flavor, especially with the inclusion of the licorice. The barreling is done with such a delicate touch that it accentuates what's already going on instead of just adding another layer of flavors. Won't risk tracking a new bottle, but I can't wait until the 2010 batch! 1,384 charactersyeahnatenelson, Jul 21, 2010
4.38/5  rDev -2.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from 22oz waxed bomber into a pint glass. This is the '09, so it's labeled as best after November 2010, but I decided to jump the gun a little to celebrate my 500th review. 
Appearance: color is entirely black and allows absolutely no light through. Head is 4 fingers of chunky dark tan foam which leaves a good lace as it dissipates. Wond'rous.
Smell: some chocolate aroma but the biggest things are wood and a slight sourness. I'm not sure whether the latter is intentional or not; it's not necessarily bad, though. Overall, the aroma is good but a little one-dimensional and less complex than I was anticipating.
Taste: flavor parallels well with the aroma in some areas, but is far more complex and dynamic. It starts out a little on the oaky/tart side, then morphs into this big huge malty, somewhat chocolatey and caramelly, but mostly just solid malt flavor, and finishes with a more burnt and roasty characteristic. That tartness and oakiness stays with you though. Damn good.
Mouthfeel: medium-thick body and, while carbonation is relatively low, there's just this fantastic silky-smooth creaminess. I think it's obtained by just great body and texture rather than relying on the carbonation. Love it.
Drinkability: I'm pretty sure this was one of the infected bottles, but really, it could have just as well been a genius recipe. The tartness kind of keeps me wanting more. 
I remember having this on tap when it was fresh last year and having a wholly different experience (of course, that batch was probably not affected by the problems of the bottled '09). I have another bottle cellared so I'm looking forward to trying it again in a year or so to see what's happened to it. 1,701 charactersflagmantho, Jul 21, 2010
4.37/5  rDev -2.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4'09 bottle into Bruery tulip, with another grateful nod to Greg (tpd975). Another fantastic box, Greg!
Pours black, with a nice, robust mocha head that takes awhile to settle into a nice cap. Interesting, somewhat delicate lacing is left as it falls as well. 
Nose is... really interesting. Tart, lactic acid emerging first, followed quickly by clear notes of smooth milk chocolate and black coffee. The acidity is never hidden, but it certainly plays nice with the big, rich, roasty stout qualities, and the end result is interesting and not at all off-putting. Definitely a bit of an Oude Bruin/Imperial Stout hybrid. Those two styles should mate more often. 
Taste is big on the lactic up front, but equally big on smooth, smokey roasted malt and rich chocolate. Acidic lactic bite starts things off, with a big, smokey malt presence emerging quickly after - I wonder if it's the acidity from the lactic pushing the smokeyness I'm getting - and a rich chocolate underpinning bracing the whole affair. Sour cherries make an appearance towards the finish, as the lactic acidity pops it head up just enough to wave goodbye, before riding away on a long, luxurious finish of smokey malt and smooth roastiness. Very, surprisingly, delicious. 
Mouthfeel is a bit on the thin side as a result of this, with a nice bite to the carbonation, but if you'll read my review of Serpent's Stout, you'll know, I kinda dig that sort of thing. Medium bodied, acidity bites the back of the throat on the swallow, and the finish lingers long and beautifully. This is not AT ALL a classic Imperial Stout mouthfeel, but that doesn't stop me from liking it. A lot. 
Drinkability is very nice. A very tasty stout, and the bite from the sourness actually masks any real alcohol notes or bite very well. Impressive once again. 
All in all, I was somewhat expecting the infection, but it's certainly not an unpleasant experience for me at all. If I was rating solidly to style, this would take a bit of a hit, but it still wouldn't be bad - it could certainly pass as a "historical interpretation", as the lactic is certainly not at all overwhelming. However, this isn't a homebrewing competition, so I'm not - I'm rating on how enjoyable I think it is, and I must say, this is pretty intriguing. I really ended up loving this beer. 2,314 charactersJohnQVegas, Jul 21, 2010

Aroma is milk chocolate sweetness, reminds me of hot chocolate. Roasted malt and a touch of anise. Alcohol is barely present in the nose considering ABV.
An Abyss that is not infected tastes wonderful. Delicate sweetness up front, chocolate milk all the way through, just the right amount of roast and bitterness. Impression of anise in the finish, cleans up nicely with a bit of bitterness. Bourbon, is pretty subdued...if you can find it, that is. Abyss has a ton of flavor but is so well balanced its almost mild mannered. Excellent.
Vintage 2009
Infected
A: Pours "stout like" except for the mocha head rapidly rising to massive proportions within my glass. Odd....
S: Sour! Sour cherries, lactic presence. The base beer is almost completely masked. A boozy Flanders Oude Bruin... 
T: Not terrible I guess. It sort of reminds me of the Berkshire sour/stout blend I had somewhat recently, just not as well crafted....and with alot more cherry. The infection in my bottle must be pretty far along, the sour cherry aspect is still prominent over the base beer. 
M: Full bodied, but over carbed 
D: Surprisingly not terrible. This infected batch is somewhat drinkable, yet a far cry from what Abyss should be. I can see some people being into sour cherried Abyss, even if just for the sake of novelty. Ill update my review in the future. 1,358 characterszoolzoo, Jul 19, 2010
4.92/5  rDev +9.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5I drank my abyss (2009) just recently and was very excited to open this beer. I chilled it just slightly before pouring.
The bottle looked great, very professional and sleek, and the appearance of the beer inside was magnificent, from the pour to the end. 
The dark, smooth flow poured into my glass and I couldn't wait to take a taste. The taste of the Abyss was very smooth, with a dark, creamy, and slightly chocolate taste. Even as it went down the back of my throat, I felt that the taste was enhanced. The chocolate was more noticeable as an aftertaste in my mouth, but was not too rich or overbearing at all. I was glad that the taste lingered and I savored every second of this beer.
The taste was fairly consistent from the top to bottom of the bottle, I couldn't notice much difference. The smooth, rich flavor made this a great beer to me. 853 charactersrhodeska, Jul 19, 2010

Appearance: Brown-black Body with thin dark brown head that dissipates as beer warm (still the same).
Smell: Aroma of Licorice and Chocolate malt blended with molasses/dark fruit overtones (Bourbon and oak notes present). 
Taste: Licorice and Chocolate malt blended with molasses/dark fruit overtones finishing with some roasty notes. Surprisingly there is some lingering hops showing up in the end (no hops left, but a nice Bourbon and mild tannic oak presence in the taste).
Mouthful: Medium body with moderate carbonation. The combination works for me.
Drinkability: Luckily my 2009 edition exhibited no signs of any infection. Drinkability is excellent, a result of the full complex malty taste and hidden alcohol for a 11% IS.
Top notch Imperial Stout worth trying (2010 vintage is in a league above subsequent vintages). 894 charactersIKR, Jul 19, 2010
4.72/5  rDev +5.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Serving type- 2008 Vintage poured into a tulip glass.
A- Pours jet black with a two finger deep tan head that quickly faids to a rather decent lacing. The lacing sticks to the tulip glass for the rest of the drink. Overall a very nice looking Imperial Stout, but nothing that sets it apart.
S- This beer has a beautiful bouquet of wide ranging smells. It starts with a pungent sweet fruity smell by itself, however as you continue to breathe in you get roasted malt flavors as well as chocolate and a faint bourbon hint near the conclusion. This is a very complex smelling beer and a great anticipation builder for when you taste it.
T- This is a mellow tasting beer (maybe because of the duration spent in my cellar). Actually this beer starts a little bitter tasting but as I let the beer warm up it settled down quite nicely. I am picking up a heavy essence of the roasted malt and chocolate flavors but other flavors I smelled are not quite as strong in the taste. The high ABV is masked rather well and is a very nice sipping beer. Overall this is a very good tasting beer (once it settles down and warms up) and is a very good representation of an Imperial Stout.
I have been saving this bottle for a year and a half and am glad that I waited this long to try it out. This beer has definately lived up to the hype and this is one the best tasting/overall presentation beers that I have had the opportunity to drink. I have several 09's sitting and I am convinced that the longer I wait to open the better tasting they will be. This is the epitomy of a beer that gets better with age and I can now see/taste why this beer is so highly rated. 1,650 characterscbros, Jul 14, 2010

A: Opaque black with almost no light transmission around the edges. Light brown foam head diminishes to a patchy layer. Heavy lacing remains near the top of the glass.
S: Faintly nutty, with no alcohol detectable. Overall very mild, not really noteworthy.
T: Very sweet malt initially with surprising coffee/chocolate bitterness quickly following. The two elements blend together to give the impression of sipping liquid bittersweet chocolate. Aromatic coffee flavors linger in the finish along with a trace of alcohol.
M: Thick, syrupy viscosity with light carbonation--exactly as a beer of this style should be.
D: While this beer is best enjoyed in smaller servings because of its rich flavors and high alcohol content, it is a pleasure to drink. Among other beers of this style, The Abyss really stands out as an example of restraint, balance, and sheer deliciousness. While this is a big beer, it is not trying to be extreme as many other imperial stouts seem. This beer begs to be sipped alongside the most decadent of chocolate desserts. 1,122 charactersbeagle75, Jul 13, 2010
4.46/5  rDev -0.4%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.522oz bottle poured into a tulip. 2009 release.
A - Viscous black beer initially crowned with a massive cinnamon-brown head. Thick rings of lace coat the glass as it recedes to about a finger's worth.
S - Chocolate leads the way, with highlights of smoke and sweet caramel. Bourbon is mostly hidden, though the oak aging does present a vanilla aroma.
T - Smooth Dutch cocoa flavor is most prominent and lasts through the long finish. Coffee comes in soon after, as well as molasses and a savory smoke flavor. Sweetness gives way to a more bitter roastiness as the beer warms, though there is a lingering caramel character. As it opens up further, there's some dark fruit - fig, raisin, plum. Hop flavor is muted and earthy, with a relatively low hop bitterness.
M - Dense, chewy, and full.
D - Mellow and enjoyable. This is a delicious stout, but I'd rank it below Kate et al. I'd love the opportunity to try this a bit younger, too. 937 characterstrbergman, Jul 11, 2010
4.53/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5I found this beer at a local Bev-Mo. The employee reluctantly admitted they had two left. He was hiding both for himself to buy later. Luckily for him, I only bought one.
Hoping for no infection. No gushing or tart smell from the bottle, so I think we're safe.
A - A deep dark brown, like molasses, looks black in the glass. One-fingered mocha-colored head that dissipates fairly quickly. No light penetrates at all - not even any color on the edges in direct light. Definitely an abyss.
S - Dark chocolate, nutty, coffee, with some caramel and vanilla notes, almost like burnt smores. Very rich and warming.
T - Deep, dark flavors, taste much like it smells. Bitter coffee is dominant. Dark chocolate. Strong coffee finish. Creamy and caramelly overtones. I'm used to Guinness, so this sort of complexity of flavor in a stout is wonderful.
M - Very smooth. Great carbonation that lightens out the bitterness.
D - A solid, drinkable stout. Lends to a slower tasting because of its complexity, need time to sort out all the flavors. But just a wonderful stout. I need a steak dinner to go with it. 1,102 characterstimonan, Jul 11, 2010

Split the bottle with newk340 into new belgium goblets. Pop the top and it's not infected! Dodged that bullet. 
a- it could be none more black. 1 finger of dense tan foam that leaves the most absurd lacing i have ever seen, i keep tipping the glass just to see it.
s- not infected! Licorice, tobacco, dark chocolate, with a bit of heat i could sniff this stuff all damn day.
t- bourbon, heat, licorice, carmalized sugars, a lot going on here. I wish there was a way to know the bottle was good without popping it, this one had a lot of potential.
m- pretty solid despite the heat and youth. is only going to get better. gave it a 4.5 on potential. it's numbers shouldn't suffer just cuz i popped it before i should have.
d- i'm just so glad i got a clean bottle... my first abyss and it was great. obviously it could have benefited from cellaring, "best after 11/1/2010," but still a pretty incredible beer. to all the ba's that ended up drain pouring, my heartfelt apologies. let's hope for an all clean 2010 batch. 1,065 charactershu5om, Jul 10, 2010

4.82/5  rDev +7.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Two plus fingers of dark brown head, despite the mixture of all bubble sizes, excellent retention and you barely see movement across the surface, yet it eventually settles closer to the surface a few minutes later, leaves a hodgepodge of lacing streaks like paint splattered against a wall. True to the category, pure black liquid, nothing more to say. Punishingly thick nose of black licorice, dark chocolate, toffee, coconut oil, vanilla bean, plum, prune, black cherry, sweet tea leaves, those fake candy orange peel gel candies, overall the roast is tamed to allow perfect balance in your nostrils and reduce the "flash" factor. Full-bodied, but some sips come across as medium-bodied which is an achievement in itself, given the "bigger and bigger" mentality today. Espresso bean, dark chocolate, vanilla extract, caramel, maple syrup and coconut establish the oak presence, sweet while also toasty, covers the full territory from tongue saturation to inner mouth perfume. The licorice starts to come on along with orange reduction and floral musk. There's an underlying graininess as well as suggestion of cayenne. I don't know jack about rumors regarding this 2009 version but this is benchmark brew. 1,207 charactersfarrago, Jul 10, 2010

Type: 22oz. Bottle
Vintage: 2009
Glassware: Portsmouth Tulip
Poured a 2 finger ink black color, w/ heavy lacing all over the glass. Appears very viscous. Nose was of sour cherries, funk, roasted chocolate, and molasses. Taste was mostly the same, sour cherries and hop bitterness overlayed w/ roasted malts, molasses, and coffee. Pretty good stuff, but definately not intended by Deschutes, something went wrong on this batch. Mouthfeel extremely viscous, but the new sour aspect makes it not feel as heavy. Drinkability is actually better at first, as the new sour aspect makes the brew feel lighter, but in the end the sour aspect started to get to me. 
Overall, they should refer to this as 2009 "The Wild" Abyss. Thankfully for Deschutes their brew is so amazing, that even with a mistake causing an infection, it was still pretty good. 859 charactersmikeyv35, Jul 09, 2010

A: Pours a deep dark brown, almost black, with a thick dark mocha colored head that quickly reduced into a bubbly film that left spots of soapy lacing around the glass.
S: Notes of sweet dark fruits, dark malt, molasses, dark cherries, vanilla, and faint bourbon, wood (oak) and alcohol. 
T: Tastes like a smooth mocha. Big notes of dark chocolate and roasted coffee intermittent with a touch of grassy hops. Molasses is present in the finish, and dark chocolate dominates the aftertaste with a hint of licorice. Slight alcohol presence in the finish along with some sweet fruitiness. 
M: Full bodied and divinely smooth. Alcohol is never hot or burning. Soft carbonation is creamy and smooth. Bitterness is low.
D: No infection here. I hope my other bottles are as good as this one so I can enjoy them after the best after date and beyond. This is definitely one of my favorite Deschutes beers. I can't wait for next years.
2007 vintage reviewed 12-18-2010. AVBC snifter.
A: Pours as black as the abyss with a thin dark brown head that quickly faded into a wispy film. 
S: Almost all of the alcohol vapor has been aged away from this one. What is left is a delicious combination of sweet molasses, dark chocolate, roasted grain, and just a hint of coffee.
T: Not as much coffee as my review of the 09 vintage suggests. This beer has aged into one hell of a smooth and subtly flavored stout. This isn't as sweet as the 09 was, or as fruity. I do get more notes of licorice in this one though, especially in the finish. Aftertaste has a dark chocolate bitterness and almost no acidity. 
M: Full bodied and just so damn smooth and creamy. Carbonation is tingly yet soft, and mouthfeel is velvety smooth. The alcohol is masked extremely with no warmth in the finish. 
D: Probably my favorite imperial stout, and not just this vintage, all of them. This is just a phenomenal beer.
2010 vintage reviewed 11-29-2011. Tulip.
A: Pours as black as the other vintages with a huge dark woody head with rusty highlights. A very impressive sheet of sticky lacing was left down the glass.
S: Rich scents of bitter chocolate, oak, molasses, and caramel. Sweet smelling. 
T: Big notes of oak and licorice. Chocolate and molasses come through very strong, and I’m not getting as much coffee as last year. The finish is full of vanilla, and the aftertaste has hints of dark fruits and raisins. The alcohol isn’t hot, but there is a good dose of warmth in the finish. The aftertaste is a little rough around the edges, and definitely more bitter than I remember. Still very good all-around. 
M: Super thick body like always, fluffy carbonation that creates a chewy and viscous body. Decadent as always.
O: Still one of my favorite stouts despite trying many others since the last time I had this beer. I think this year’s still has a little bit more aging to do before it is just perfect.
2008 vintage reviewed 3/17/2012. Thanks Able!
A: Same as others. Super deep brown/black with ruddy highlights.
S: More roasted than I remember the others being.
T: Definitely roasted and almost smokey. I get a hint of soy but it's faint. Molasses is thick and rich. Tobacco in the finish. Still a bit boozy. 
M: Thick body, low but tingly carb and still some booze.
O: Still an amazing beer but not my favorite vintage. Don't get me wrong, this is world-class, but I like it with a little less age. 3,424 charactersscottfrie, Jul 09, 2010

A: Pours a lovely black velvet with a huge chocolate milk head if poured aggressively that has some super sticky lacing to it. Retention is a little low thats about the only negative
S: Pure chocolate coffee. i dont really want to write more than that. Its whats expected and its what i want 
T: Not as much coffee chocolate like the smell. I get a bitter roasted herbal light chocolate but when I breathe out the coffee hits me. I do pick up some sort of lactose creaminess in there with a pinch of licorice.
M: The body is a little watery compared to other big stouts. I'm not saying thats a bad things its just different. The carbonation blows up each sip and urges you to take the sip. Its hard to get a good taste with all the bubbles. 
D: While the bubbles were bad for the mouthfeel it made up for it with the drinkability. Like I said the beer urges you take take another sip. The taste isnt crazy powerful and full bodied to make this a huge sipper. I'd imagine this one would sneak up on me pretty fast if I were to take down the whole bottle by myself.

22 oz wax sealed bottle poured into my snifter glass
A - A viscious black with a finger width of mocha head. It leaves great lacing.
S - I get coffee, roast, chocolate, oak, and a decent presence of vanilla. There may be a slight metallic tinge to it, but nothing that suggests it's infected. I think the beer still needs to mellow out.
T - I get a lot of roast, coffee, chocolate, maybe a touch of vanilla, and just a touch of that metallic tinge, and then lots of chocolate and licorice on the finish.
Now, what to do with my other 7 bottles? I don't think this metallic tinge is going to get any worse. 
M - Heavy body with a nice amount of carbonation. Not too much, not too little.
D - Could be better. Sad this isn't turning out to be a good year for this beer, as it's the first time I bought a lot of bottles of it. 949 charactersKaiser81, Jul 07, 2010

The appearance was pretty standard for an imperial stout. There was nothing too special but it looked good. It poured a smooth, yet viscous, midnight black with some sediment in the pour. There was a slight khaki head that laced the glass. It smelled of coffee, oak, and chocolate with some slight sweetness to it. As for the taste, it had a slightly oaky chocolatey bitterness. There was perhaps a scent of vanilla as well. The mouthfeel was good but nothing too special either. There was medium carbonation to go with the full body. The alcohol wasn't present in the taste at all, which was surprising. As for drinkability, I wasn't blown away by the Abyss. In fact, I was a little disappointed. I expected it to be more than it was, mainly due to it's reputation as a top ten beer. It was good, but didn't live up to the hype. 911 charactersaasher, Jul 07, 2010

2009 Vintage
*Note: No spoilage was noticed.
A: Small creamy tan head floating atop a liquid black hole. No observable thinning along the edges. This is a thick, viscous brew. Not much lacing, but a nice creamy cover lingers.
S: Powerful bitter chocolate aroma sweetened with a hing of molasses and caramel. Licorice notes in the background.
T: Bitter chocolate takes center stage with a hint of booze in the background. Dark sweet maltiness with molasses and perhaps a bit of vanilla. Very pleasing palate, something to be savored with friends. This would shine with a meal, but did just fine on the deck. A bit more time for the booze to mellow would help tremendously.
M: Creamy body with low to medium carbonation. A little hot, but no noticeable burn. Low bitterness on the tongue.
D: Great beer, but one bottle is plenty and sharing is even better. Goes down easy for the style, and I can't ask for more than that.
O: Worth the wait, and worth the effort to track it down. 1,076 charactersdpnelson1978, Jul 07, 2010

Pours a dark oily color body with a big bubbly tan coffee colored head that last forever.
Smell is of big chocolate and coffee with a funky barnyard smell normally associated with sours. Kind of strange, this must be one of the infected bottles.
Taste is chocolate and barnyard funk. Some acidic and vinegar notes as well. Yup, this beer must be infected. Imagine a wild ale had sex with an imperial stout, this is their lovechild. 
Mouthfeel has high carbonation with a dry leathery feel. Not good.
I guess the rumor is true, the 2009 Abyss batch has gone bad. I am truly disappointed as this was my first Abyss ever and I was eagerly awaiting drinking it. 675 characterspmccallum86, Jul 02, 2010
4.56/5  rDev +1.8%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 52009 bottle. Add me to list who've jumped the gun due to the infection scare.
A: Black as night, with a big thick tan head that covers more than half the glass at first pour. Going to have to take this in 1/4 increments.
S: Oh my. Out of the bottle, a slight sour smell emanates...once in the glass, a sour bourbon smell wafts out, along with the normal hints of licorice and molasses as advertised.
T: At first, the sourness shows itself with the "normal" Abyss flavors (rich chocolate, a hint of black licorice, a nice bourbon finish), like that guy who shows up at your party claiming to be someone's cousin. But as time goes on, and the beer warms up, he passes out and goes to sleep. Translation, it's still the same good beer at the moment when it warms up and airs out a touch.
M: Thick, smooth, decadent. Everything a stout should be here.
D: Lethally smooth, once the party crasher fades. No alcohol evident, just the smoothest big stout I've come across.
I fear for the other five in my cellar, but they will soldier on. Hopefully whatever infection exists, will remain a minor annoyance. Still a world-class stout from a world-class brewery.
Note: I opened a bottle 3 months ago upon purchase with no signs of infection. Only difference was a little more alcohol "heat". Scores balanced against both tastings. 1,327 charactersVaylaus, Jun 29, 2010
4.6/5  rDev +2.7%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Had a 2009 bottle previously I will give them a chance of redemption. 2010 bottle.
It pours a deep, rich black with a frothy, creamy dark brownish tan head that sparkles with bubbles and eventually leaves beautiful ringed lacing on the sides of my snifter. It sure looks great.
It has a thick-smelling molasses, caramel, and chocolate bonanza. There is some nice biscuity scent in there as well. The oak comes in slightly with oakiness and some vanilla. Roasted malts and coffee round out the scent profile. The one thing I'm missing in the scent is the advertised licorice. It surprisingly smells very similar to last year, minus the hint of sourness.
The flavor is very nice. This is a rich, robust stout with plenty of bitterness unlike some of the other big-name stouts. Lots of bitter cocoa, roasted malt, and coffee, it just comes in waves. The barrel aging doesn't present itself as much in the flavor. There is some oak flavor but not an oaky smoothness. It is woody but in a way that accentuates the bitterness. It could be just because this stout is so much more bitter than its counterparts. Usually you see the oak melding with the sweetness creating a smooth, rich flavor. This one instead opts for a woodsy bitterness. I love it. The sweetness is there though. It creeps up on you, most of it is chocolate. It isn't too harsh with the alcohol, but you can feel it is a pungent brew. The things it lacks in the flavor though are bourbon and licorice, but maybe they just blend in so well that I don't notice them.
This one stands tall in the imperial stout category. I think the reason people love it is it doesn't get over the top with the sweetness. 1,669 characterscrossovert, Jun 28, 2010
3.96/5  rDev -11.6%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Aroma:Upon first whiff, I get a slightly sour bourbon smell. There is just a hint of chocolate and caramel in the nose.
Appearance:This is a dark, dark beer, with a thick and creamy head, that you can cut with a knife. Very decent lacing.
Taste:Alcohol burn hits you squarely upon the first sip. The foretaste is a slightly sour bitterness with dark malts. The creamy dark malty flavor continues through the mid and aftertaste. The hops play second (or third) fiddle to the malts and bourbon.
Mouthfeel:Thick and creamy, with alcohol heat. Not very much carbonation in the mouthfeel.
Drinkability:This 2009 beer is Best After 11/1/2010, and could definitely use more aging. As the beer is still young, it makes sense that the bourbon is on the heavy side, but still an enjoyable sipping beer. 796 charactersfear025, Jun 26, 2010
4.8/5  rDev +7.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5This was a 2009 bottle that was opened a few months prior to the suggested initial opening date by Deschutes. 
A - Half fingered mocha colored head and is black as black can be. Looks very viscous and there no light getting through this black hole.
S - Very rich cocoa and bitter dark chocolate with mild amounts of molasses, oak, light vanilla bean, and anise/black licorice.
T - Mimics the nose but with more intensity. Has a dry oak complexity with a tobacco flavor intermingled with bitter chocolate, cocoa, molasses, and vanilla. Finishes dry and leaves a bitter chocolate/tobacco coating in the mouth that lingers on and on to remind you of the previous euphoric sip.
M - Smooth and creamy with a heavy and full body. Slides over the tongue like total silk.
D - Exceptional. 
This is my opinion of how an Imperial Stout should taste and ranks as one of the most enjoyable I've ever had for the style. Too bad this beer is so hard to get, I wish I lived closer to the brewery! Every sip was savored in a snifter, simply amazing and not one of those overrated beers. It's not too often I get this excited about a beer, definitely worthy of its prestigeous status. 1,173 charactersjzeilinger, Jun 26, 2010

T - Chocolate, licorice and roasted malt notes hit me up front. A very nice touch of vanilla comes through followed by the smooth warmth of Bourbon. This is how a beer is supposed to taste...
M - A thick full body with a decent amount of carbonation for how creamy this one is...
D - This is by far one of the best beers I have tasted . If i had the money I would drink these all day long. Had this on a fairly empty stomach, and caught a nice buzz. Looking foward to visiting this one again on xmas.

Pours a jet black with a coffee colored head. The head was very minimal and reduced to a film. Smells of bitter chocolate and sweet licorice. Smells a bit weak for my tastes. Taste is another story. This one explodes with licorice, chocolate and a nice burn of bourbon. This beer is quite bitter and I am finding it very enjoyable. This is extremely tasty. The mouthfeel is a bit thinner than I am used to for the style, but I actually prefer it. This is so tasty that it raises the drinkability despite the strength.

4.82/5  rDev +7.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.52009 vintage. Poured into a snifter. Big thanks to kbutler1 for this one. Due to the recent infection scare, I've decided to do my own investigative reporting. Here are my results:
4.5 A: A suspicious syruppy black enters my snifter. Two fingers of medium brown, frothy/creamy hybrid head stares me down for a slightly better than average amount of time. Indeed, the last quarter inch beckons me to attempt a sniff. Tormented lacing covers all angles of the glass. 
5.0 S: Half expecting lactobacillus to bring forth pain and destruction, I lean over my glass. Instead, I am greeted with a lovely bouquet of amiable aromas. Sweet chocolate is most apparent with vanilla oakiness and molasses tying for the silver. The next wave brings a subdued bourbon and brewer's licorice.
5.0 T: The taste is as magical as the nose. Bourbon and licorice step forward from their stealth positions take command. Vanilla and molasses are second. Oakiness, a mild bitterness, and roasted barley play their roles as well. Alcohol is apparent, but not overly so.
4.5 M: Lighter heavy body. Good moderate carbonation. Creamy and smooth with a moderate warming aftertaste.
4.5 D: The barleywines and RISs of my cellar rejoice. Their comrad has not been subdued by illness, but rather by Emporer DavoleBomb, who chuckles with delight as another great brew has done his bidding. Lots of great stuff going on with this one. I dare say this is better than the 08. One day an epic vertical will decide the true victor. 1,497 charactersDavoleBomb, Jun 23, 2010

Pours jet black, with a huge rocky mocha colored head, which stays with the beer throughout. I initially get a very, very slight funky/sour smell, along with wood, charcoal, molasses and black licorice. Very smooth, with flavors of dark chocolate, black licorice, bourbon and charred oak. This one seems to have mellowed a bit over the last seven months or so, and is becoming a pretty solid beer. 472 charactersemmasdad, Jun 22, 2010
4.45/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured into a snifter The Abyss appears pretty much pitch black in color. When held up to the light it still is nothing but a black darkness in the glass. However, when swirled around to thin it out, light eventually gets a chance to shine through and display some ruby red hues. The head initially appears with 2 fingers of brown head that receeds to a thin half finger atop the brew that retains well once it settles in it's place. Appendages of lacing stick all about the glassware. 
When the bottle was cracked and poured, I immediately shoved my nose in the glass and there was an abundant amount of metallic character to be noted. However, as it warms the metallic notes slowly fade and give way to a greater depth of complexity. This brew has a "best after date of 11/1/2010" and you can tell it would best be enjoyed with a little more time spent in the bottle. It is big and boozy but I couldn't resist opening this, I needed to try it. Behind the bold scent of alcohol there is a great amount of dark burnt grain character smelling of roasted goodness wrapped around and blended with notes of licorice and hints of dark sugary sweetness contributed by the molasses. Finishing out the aroma in the back is the sweetness from the molasses along with a bit of dark fruit character a bit like prunes and a woodsy scent leaves the last impression in the nose..
The flavors of this brew are all over the place perplexing the palate but always working together to be an enjoyable experience with every sip. The alcohol is bold and stands firm throughout the entire tasting experience. However, the boldness of the alcohol helps to accent some of the flavors of the dark grain bitterness that linger in the mouth. Other tastes of dry woodsiness are noted along with an ever present character of brewer's licorice and faint dark sugary sweetness brought forth by the molasses. Residing in the back of the throat with every sip is the burn of the alcohol along with a bitter dark grain flavor that at times has suggestions of hoppy citrus bitterness also being contributed. Furthermore there is a very light touch of sourness suggesting possibly the use of sourmashing techniques in this brew (or heaven forbid the early signs of infection.)
The body of this beer is much lighter than I expected. Perhaps it is the sterotypical assumption that dark beers have more body. Or possibly it was the incorporation of molasses that made me think this would be heavy...regardless it isn't. It is more of a middle of the road medium bodied brew than thick and viscous as I expected. The carbonation is pretty much spot on. Drinkability is about as good as it gets for a beer of this magnitude. This is a good one to sit down and enjoy over a length of time or share with some friends. I look forward to enjoying it again. 2,815 charactersstakem, Jun 22, 2010

A - Black as midnight, not even a hint of light getting through. It's a pretty dark room, but I think it got even darker when I poured this. Two-finger mocha-colored head that dissipates after a couple of minutes, with not much in the way of a cap. Rings of lace around the glass.
S - Burnt sugar and molasses at first, with just a little sweetness in the back of your throat. Roasted malt and coffee in the middle. Slight hints of dark chocolate and vanilla. 
T - Much more of the roasty malts, and dark chocolate up front. French roast coffee, molasses, and now I get the licorice that I didn't get in the nose. Not getting a lot of bourbon, which is a slight disappointment, but it doesn't hurt the flavor at all. This is an excellent, excellent beer. Not much heat from the alcohol either. My only regret is that I don't have any chocolate to pair with this. 
M - Thick, heavy, and nearly syrupy. I'm not sure where others are feeling that this is too thin; if this was thicker it might be almost too much. 
D - I've had a bomber now and showing no signs of slowing down. By itself it might be a bit much, but being paired with some smoked gouda provides a counterbalance that keeps me wanting more. I might just go open a second. 
O - This is truly a great beer. I'm glad that I bought a few; I might even go back to buy another half a case. Can't wait to see what a year or two will do for it. 1,496 charactersdjmichaelk, Jun 21, 2010

Pours a black hole of deep rich brown color, with milk chocolate, vanilla and a hint of raisin on the nose. Dark chocolate, cocoa powder, burnt sugar & cinnamon all make appearances in the taste. Oily & syrup-like in texture. Haven't tried any other vintages of this beer, but the 2007 seems to be doing quite well. Tasty! 386 charactersbranimal9, Jun 15, 2010

A-Pours deep brown, almost black, trailing to ruby brown with a pooling mocha head and good sticky lacing.
S-Caramel, dark chocolate, rum soaked dark fruit and some mild alcohol. In a word, awesome.
T-Really as good as this style gets. Complex, rich flavors. Roasted coffee and sweet chocolate and caramel, with a hint of tobacco and molasses. Finishes with a moderate amount of warming alcohol.
M-Medium to heavy bodied with good carbonation. surprisingly light on the tongue.
D-Not sure what vintage this was but boy was this smooth! Much more pleasant and easy to drink than fresh bottles I have had.. One of the best beers of Philly Beer Week!

When I opened the bottle ( the wax sucks to open) it at first let me down since the intial sips had metallic notes in the finish. With all the hype I wanted this beer to blow me away but things were starting off rough. Thankfully it warmed up and the metallic notes disappeared replace with a long luscious chocolate note mixed in with vanilla and dark malts. The nose also was inviting and complex. End result a great beer though not the best in the style I have tried. Maybe I should have taken it home and put it in the cellar? 647 characterscanucklehead, Jun 14, 2010

Off the tap and into the tulip, abysss looks black in the glass, dark night black, blackness, just like a stout. A firm inch of dark khaki brown foam on top with a milkshake consistancy. Smells include a nice big roasty presence mixed in with some chocolate and licorice with a slight presence of the oak aging, not much of the bourbon comes through. It's not the boldest nose, I'll admit. Taste picks things up with dark roasted malt goodness combined with some chocolate and light vanilla. Some anise squirts along with dark licorice. Mollases up front and not hop forward, there is some hint of em though. Off the tap this stuff is great, the feel is not as big as something of this stature should be. It went down all to smooth. Not overly sweet, or overly hopped, well balanced. A big body with nice light carb. If I was not driving I would of stayed longer and had a glass more, but no more than that. It's big, it needs to be respected. 1,041 charactersBARFLYB, Jun 07, 2010
4.18/5  rDev -6.7%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 42009 bottling. Poured into a pint glass, and a big chocolatey head with fat bubbles bursting through as it settles over a few minutes down to a thin, brown layer. Inky brown-black. Gorgeous. This is how a beer really ought to look. I would imagine a nitro tap would be even better, but I can't imagine anything coming out of a bottle looking any better.
Nose fulfills with chocolate, coffee, bitterness, and ... popcorn? A little saltiness at least.
The licorice, coffee, and bitterness flows through in perfection. A little metallic. I don't think there's really much else going on here, but what is is nailed. Great stout here.
I'm actually a little surprised it's not heavier on the mouth. For the style it's probably perfect. Good carbonation. The nitro bubble size would improve it I think.
Very drinkable. The alcohol doesn't burn through ever, and it's not too heavy at all. If your tolerance can deal, you can drink a lot of this. Of course at 11% you might have to get a 2nd liver. 994 charactersChizoad, Jun 07, 2010

A- comes my way with a good finger of chestnut brown frothy head that settles quickly to some suds on top and bit of lace. Pitch black with hints of brown at the very edges. 
S- tons of brownie batter and the darkest roasted coffee I've ever experienced in a beer. Anise and a mild oaky char. Hints of the bourbon but very fleeting. 
T- the espresso and dark chocolate take the lead and roll ever so smoothly into the semi sweet anise and dark roasted malts. A bit of a bitterness breaks through the murk and adds to the roast and plays with the sweet nicely, I can't tell if its from some hops or some of the roasted beans. the oak and char open up with warming and bring a hint of the bourbon with it. 
M- thick and chewy but the perfect amount of carb on draft brings this brew to a new level and I love it. Dry finish. 
D- for a beer of this depth of flavor, boldness, and abv this is amazingly drinkable. I've had the bottle but on draft is crazy. 1,035 charactersoglmcdgl, Jun 06, 2010

Pitch black with a three finger khaki head. Takes awhile to die down to a layer of bubbly foam. Some lacing left down the side of the glass.
Cocoa nibs, oak, vanilla and dark fruits.
Cocoa nibs and oak up front. Then some dark chocolate, smoke and a hint of vanilla. There are dark fruits and coffee bitterness in there as well. Tobacco and a hint of caramel on the way out. Smoke, oak and tobacco remain pretty strong in the aftertaste. The beer is a little too charred bordering acrid, otherwise it would have gotten a higher rating for taste.
The beer is on the low side of full bodied, somewhat creamy and a sharp bite on the end. Slightly hot on the way down.
Quite drinkable. Not much bourbon presence, unfortunately. 854 charactersbillshmeinke, Jun 05, 2010

Shared with the parents before I leave home for my first REAL job : /.
Pours very dark with a nice dark brown head. Very little head initially, but after the pour it increases substantially. Not much of a smell for me, I get my nose very close but I don't detect much other than alcohol and coffee.
The taste is great, however. It has some very definite coffee and chocolate undertones, as well as a bitterness I can't quite put my finger on - perhaps leather? I'm really not getting any bourbon at all, my dad claims to pick up on some though so maybe my sense of taste just isn't acute enough to pick up on it. Mouthfeel is great, just what you would want from an imperial stout. It coats my mouth completely and I can taste it long after I take a drink. Great beer overall, if you get a chance to try it don't pass it up! 979 charactersAWolf, Jun 05, 2010
3.83/5  rDev -14.5%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.52009. Certainly a deep dark brown, it wasn't as thick and oily as I would have expected from something called the "abyss". Small tan head revealing the carbonation. Scents of roasted malts and coffee as expected, others of licorice, soy and booze. 
It tastes like it smells. Mildly charred malt flavors and a little coffee...kind of salty. Way less boozy in the taste, not much bourbon. I like a lot of bourbon barreled beers, but the barrel and bourbon always seem to be dominant. While classic bourbon flavor wasn't there, some residue sweetness was there along with hints of wood...It was good but not great. Assuming they make a 2010 release I'd go try a bottle of that too, but I don't think I'd line my shelves with it. 726 charactersliquidcraft, Jun 03, 2010

Strong malts and determined hops, very smokey with lots of roasted barley. Flavor is intense. Robust roasted malts, wood, leather, smoke, coffee, and chocolate. At 11%abv you'd think the alcohol would be overpowering but you'd wrong. It's masterfully hidden behind a monster malt backbone and a clever wall of hops. Still, this should come with a warning about operating heavy equipment after consuming. 522 charactersLakes, Jun 02, 2010

The Abyss doesn't pour nearly black or syrupy enough to be called "the abyss". Black with dark brown highlights, dark brown head. It's definitely a very dark beer, but I've seen thicker and darker. Smell is a bit muted, especially considering we were drinking it at cellar temp. Roasted coffee and roasted malt, a bit of wood but I don't get any bourbon in the nose. Straight ethanol when you get your nose way down in there. Very roasty and particularly bitter flavor. Roasted malt and coffee, a bit of oakiness but nothing that identifies itself as a bourbon barrell. A taste I can't put my finger on that must be the licorice. A taste that I can put my finger that I have to describe as soy sauce. I appreciate that it has a subtle oakiness but doesn't taste like chewing on woodchips that have been soaked in bourbon like some barrel aged beers do. Lingering roasty bitterness in the finish. I like this 33% aging and mixing idea they used here, I think it makes for a complex beer that doesn't end up overpowered by the barrel flavors. Mouthfeel is thick and chewy with a lot of warmth. Its really not all that sweet compared to some other imp stouts, resulting in a high drinkability for me personally. 1,278 charactersShumista, May 30, 2010

C. To Dark to Tell
H. Black
N. Roasty Malt, Licorice, and a faint Sour Smell (Jolly Pumpkin Like)
Unlike so many of the beers in this tasting from this past week, this beer had the best balance of carbonation and flavor. the malt really sticks out well in the beer. Although this would really be better after a year or so of cellaring. The beer was not super strong on the alcohol end. It is drinkable now, but I think it would be perfectly balanced in about two years. Hops came out a bit in the attack of the beer but were quickly covered up by the thick malty base of this beer. I won't write this one off to 100% beer-hype but there is a lot of talk about a good stout here, and that's just it. I think it needs to age to be a Great Stout. 766 charactersDosBeerigos, May 11, 2010

T- Roast, malt, bourbon, molasses, dark chocolate, faint licorice, and an appreciated hop bitterness. Alcohol was very faint, even when it was at its warmest. 
M- Thin to medium. Quite thin compared to others, but that may be because Ive been on a Barleywine binge. 
D- This a surprisingly very drinkable beer, but definitely a sipper.

Pours a dark brown with a beautiful fluffy thick tan head. Aroma is a bit sour actually with a flavor to match. After the initial sour-ish flavor passes there is a nice malty/roasty taste that begins to take over. As it warms up the flavor change and it becomes much more enjoyable and drinkable. Definitely something I want to revisit with a bit more age on it...

Cut through the thick wax seal. Black wax seal and bottle artwork compliment each other well. Poured into two Ommegang ale glasses to share with my wife.
A: Dark, dark chocolate color with awesome creamy head. The head builds and appears more like a delicious cake batter. Reminds me of my Mom's date bread after she poured it into the bread pan. The large bubbles slowly pop and expand. The chocolate foam slowly recedes back into the liquid as a reddish ring around the glass. Impressive.
S: The oak and bourbon come through as well as dried fruit and dark chocolate.
T: Dark chocolate, dried fruit, very earthy, not as roasted as I would expect. Awesome smooth with dry aftertaste. Truly delicious.
M: Full bodied but lighter than other stouts that I have experienced lately. More like a fine wine.
D: This is an unbelievable beer. Extremely easy to drink down, but also nice to swirl in the glass and take in the aroma and savor. After dinner treat.
Summary: I seriously need to try this one again after it has some age on it. Although I can't imagine that it gets much better than this. Matches the hype it receives. Awesome! 1,195 charactershonestdave, May 05, 2010

This stout is absolutely amazing. It's very mellow and smooth on the taste buds. The 2010 is probably the best Abyss I have had (better than the 2009 infected obviously). 
Smell of coffee and chocolate invade your smell receptors instantly!
It has little lacing and is very very dark. Black as motor oil! But taste like God's elixir on a winter evening. I am drinking it right now as I review. I love it
This is one of the few beers that absolutely meets up to all the hype it gets!
If I could buy the rights to this beer and install it as a tap in my house I would! 
The only con is the price ($12.99). But price means nothing when it's justified.

 (A)- Pours fairly thick & an absolutely pitch black color; I can see why this is called the Abyss. . no light gets through it! Produced a lovely frothy brown head despite the high abv level. Its just sticking to every inch on the sides of the glass. Great retention; there was still foam 1/2 way through drinking the bottle. 
(S)- Rich & dense bread-like components with bits of raisin, molasses, cocoa, licorice, coffee grounds, and even a bit of cinnamon or nutmeg in there. Complex yet smooth smelling; no heat or bourbon potency detected. A glorious aroma. 
(T)- Potent & yet rich dense flavors. More of that almost dry bread-like character. Great molasses & licorice combo in the middle ground. Am adequate bitterness like that of coffee grounds with cocoa & a nutmeg thing. Finishes with a tiny hint of vanilla with slightly bitter dark chocolate. Incredibly dynamic and complex.
(M)- A great carbonation level & balance. A perfect mix of rich roasted malts, light bitter licorice & coffee, and a delicately light chocolate-like sweetness. It just rolls off the tongue with smoothness despite it richness & potency. Where is the whopping 11%abv? Expertly integrated alcohol level; it tastes no more than an 7-8% to me. The biggest surprise of this beer is actually how smooth it is. 
(D)- This was an absolute joy to consume. A brilliant stout deserving of its rating, ranking, and style. It just rolls off the tongue. Easily one of the easiest drinking stouts of this strength and profile I may have ever had. I can only imagine what further aging will do to this. Simply awesome stuff; cant wait to try another one after the best after date!
**Update**
Upon having this numerous additional times since my initial review, I felt this beer needed an overall rating change. I really believe that this beer is at its best fresher and does not really benefit from further aging. But as with any beer, that is my 2 cents. 2,051 characterssweemzander, May 01, 2010
4.32/5  rDev -3.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4This is for a three year vertical review from 2007, 2008 and 2009:
1-Deschutes' Abyss 2007, 11% abv, Imperial Stout. This poured a dark dark chocolate black with a touch of espresso cream. This had a HUGE burnt malt, smokey salted bacon, light raisin, and dates in it. It tasted of espresso with a HUGE smoky character to it and a slightly dry, light ending. My favorite of the evening.
2-Deschutes' Abyss 2008, 11% abv, Imperial Stout. This one was WAY sweeter than the 2007 version. It smelled of sweet caramel, stewed dark fruits, malt and toffee. It tasted sweet, with sweet fig newtons, caramel, a light faint smokiness, light hoppiness into a dry espresso ending.
3-Deschutes' Abyss 2009-11% abv, Imperial Stout. Unfortunately this one seemed a little off. It smelled SOUR!!! It had some light raisin, sweet malt and juicy grapefruit in the nose. It tasted again, SOUR, with a light spice to it, tangy grapefruit skin, candied malt and a light bitter finish. SO it seems like this puppy had a bit of a bottle infection due to the sour that we all got out of it. 1,070 charactersfemALEist, Apr 28, 2010

Appearance: Pours jet black, with a finger and a half of brown head. The head lingers for a surprisingly long time, considering the ABV. Lots of lacing. Beautiful, beautiful looking beer.
Smell: A mix of alcohol, bourbon, and oak, with some dark chocolate in the background. There's a slight astringency on the initial pour, but it fades fairly quickly. As the beer warms, the chocolate flavors get even stronger.
Taste: A surprisingly strong hop and roasted malt bitterness, backed by heavy chocolate flavors. A slight astringent tang, and a hint of bourbon. The oak is surprisingly strong, almost to the point of overpowering, especially on the back end. It makes the finish somewhat dry, and there's a definite contrast in flavor from beginning to end of the sip. Alcohol isn't really evident.
Mouthfeel: Incredibly thick and creamy, and perfectly carbonated. It's thick enough to stand up to all of the heavy flavors in this beer.
Drinkability: A very good beer. Maybe it was all the hype surrounding it, but I was a little bit let down by this one. The oak flavors are almost overpowering. However, the overall blend of flavors are smooth enough to make me want to drink this faster than I should. I'm glad I got a chance to try this. 1,396 charactersStarlightSeraph, Apr 28, 2010

2009 vintage
Many thanks to jamdugan for this bottle & PDXHops for the chance to try it sometime down the road.
On the pour, the beer is a very dark, burnt-cherry/brown color. Obviously, it looks black once settled, but there are dark brown highlights around the edges when the glass is tilted. ¼ inch of fairly dark brown head is manifest upon the pour. It doesn't hold up too well; though swirling revives a decent layer. Lacing is pretty sparse. 
There are definite licorice notes with plenty roasted dark malt aromas: molasses, dark fruits - prunes & raisins - & hints of caramel. There are undoubtedly overtones of wood & oak, though bourbon isn't all that appreciable. There are some notions of vanilla in there, too. The nose is rather dense & quite solid overall.
The taste is similar to the nose, only much more potent. The malts here come across as burnt more than anything. A very faint bitterness upfront gives way to intense swaths of licorice & burnt molasses. This beer lacks no subtlety. The bourbon portion is more apparent to taste, though it is a supportive role & not in the forefront. There are also distinct notes of oak with hints of vanilla. Dryness overtakes any sweetness that is present; I really like the burnt qualities, which are well-suited to the intensity of the beer. 
Full bodied & very dense; it's pushing the chewy territory for sure. While there is a touch of alcohol heat & slickness, it still has a good deal of grittiness. Lots of burnt & roasted malt notes linger on the finish - licorice, molasses, dark fruits, wood & a slight bitterness. 
Hell yeah The Abyss. It's one to savor slowly. This is such a good beer; I can't wait to see how it ages (admittedly, it does seem rather fresh). I will update accordingly. Easily recommended. 1,842 charactersRyan011235, Apr 27, 2010

A - Profoundly black, with a respectable chocolate milk-colored head that actually sticks around for awhile. Very unusual for this style. Looks incredible in a snifter.
S - Pretty standard for an impy stout; roasted malts, coffee, some chocolate. Now licorice. Hrm. Not a licorice fan, but let's see where this goes...
T - Okay, the licorice and molasses are right up front here, but it's working. This doesn't taste like other double imperials, and I'm liking the uniqueness. Dark fruits emerge as this warms, also the mocha and woodsmoke arrive later, but fashionably so. I'm liking this more with each sip.
M - After hitting Dark Lord and Bourbon Cty. Coffee yesterday, this is awfully thin by comparison. Not a dealbreaker, because it remains smooth throughout, but if drinking DL and BCBCS is like pulling on fine cigars or a well-packed pipe, this is more like a smooth drag on a hand-rolled cigarette. Nothing wrong with that...
D - Like I said, a real grower. Very easy to sip as it warms.
The nose was a bit lacking, and the mouthfeel as well, but overall this is a lovely stout worthy of its reputation.
2014 vintage; consumed and reviewed on 1-4-15
Everything I wrote above I stand by. But my nose especially has evolved considerably since, so another go.
The Abyss pours jet-black with a lovely finger of mocha foam that has staying power, and leaves substantial lacing even after it dissipates. The bouquet is fantastic this time around, mocha and dark roast and baker's chocolate w a pleasant hint of vanilla and woodsmoke. As it warms, notes of figs, licorice and pinot noir waft into the mix. The flavor is delightfully complex, folding in everything from the aroma but adding grace notes of bourbon and brandy and port, w star turns from the star anise and black strap molasses. Wow. The feel is appropriately thick for the style, and the finish is long and balanced between sweetness and roasted malt and earthy hops. What a fine stout. I hope I don't go 5 years between bottles again. 2,105 charactersAJacob81, Apr 27, 2010

A- Pours a thick black color with a nice milk chocolate colored head 2 fingers thick that hung around for a while, chocolate lacing was left all over my glass.
S- First off you get hit with nice molasses, roasted malt, and licorice. You then get more vanilla bourbon oak, dark chocolate, fig, dark soft fruit.
T- Molasses, yes right away followed by the malt, dark and some milk chocolate, licorice, vanilla oak. On the back it finishes with the dark soft fruits and a decent amount of alcohol warmth, not hot just warm.
M- Nice and big, full body with ample carbonation, borderline too much carbonation need to give it more time. Not overpowering with the alcohol content, just a warming on the finish.
D- Great beer with loads of flavor, love that they added the molasses, licorice and oak aging. Will have to try again in a couple of years... 893 charactersSchmaltzy, Apr 26, 2010

Thisk and oily. Large dark foamy head. Aroma is full of sweet dark dried fruit, roasty, chocolate, ethanol, with some bourbon vanilla notes. Sweet and roasty, lots of dark cocoa and ethanol. Finish is more tannic, some licorice. Bourbon and vanilla throughout. Aftertaste is very burnt/roasty, lingering.
Fortunately seems to have missed the infection bullet...

22 oz. bottle, 2008 vintage, tried 10 Apr 2010. Got this from my brother for Christmas 2008, guess he really does like me...
Served in a 512 One snifter. What to say that hasn't already been said? Pours pitch black. Large thick dark brown head. Lots of cocoa, coffee, mocha and licorice in the aroma. Big, in your face flavors of coffee, cocoa, molasses, alcohol. Begins very roasty bitter while the finish is more sweet and warming. Aftertaste of bitter espresso and licorice is long and lingering. Viscous mouthfeel.

5/5  rDev +11.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Quite possibly the most dangerous beer I've ever had. The smoothness of this beer makes me want to drink it all day long. The 11% would probably kill me after awhile but I'm kinda thinking it would be worth it. I put this on tap last year and can't wait til November to do it all over again. I will probably do unspeakable things to, for and probably with my Deschutes rep in order to get more than one keg but the jail time is most definitely something I can accept. Every nerve in your body tingles when you drink this beer. This beer reminds me of being a kid again. It reminds me of drinking chocolate milk while watching my favorite cartoon with my best friend bugs bunny and sitting in the middle of all my star wars and gi joe toys and basking in the glory of them bowing to me like I'm Gulliver or something. This beer reminds me of my best day ever. Anyways, this beer really is like a mocha chocolate milk. The coffee and malts are strong yet not overpowering. You want to drink this beer so fast but yet you find yourself weeping when you near the bottom. I would suggest this beer to novices and beer gods alike. Congratulations Beer!!! 1,148 charactersSDHoffers, Apr 21, 2010
5/5  rDev +11.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I had the 2009 vintage on tap at Stone Brewing Co. This is, by far, the best stout I have tried yet.
A - Black...period. Colors of dark maroon and cola are present when this beer is swirled in front of a light. I had a decent light brown head with excellent lacing that was retained till the last drop. 
S - Scents of coffee, chocolate, molasses, and roasted malts are dominant with mild hints of oak in the background. I could not pick up any hop notes.
T - Delicious!!! Bold and sweet flavors of malts, coffee, and molasses initially followed by a dry hoppy finish. The oak and the bourbon flavors where obvious, but the licorice could not be detected. 
M/D - This beer had a creamy and silky mouthfeel. Not as bold as I expected it to be considering its rich appearance. And considering that it is an 11% ABV, this was a very easy drinking beer. 852 charactersLoadedgunz, Apr 21, 2010
4.5/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5On tap at Callahan's, San Diego.
Pours a nice solid black color with a minimal thin film on top. Great aroma of roasted malts with some warm, sweet hints of alcohol (not too strong, though!). Has a sweet roasted malt flavor. There's a bit of coffee and some berries (blackberries?) bitterness towards the finish. The beer has a very light tingly carbonation, is medium-bodied and smooth. Strong in alcohol, but it doesn't come into the taste or really affect the drinkability. A very enjoyable beer great for finishing a night at the brewpub. 543 charactersmithrascruor, Apr 15, 2010

Pours black with about a pinky fingers worth of tan head. Smells like roasted malts, chocolate, cocoa and coffee. I taste cocoa, alcohol, and a nice coffee finish. This beer has a perfect amount of carbonation for this style, and it's nice and thick. It's definitely a sipper, luckily there were three of us that split the bomber.

A: Truly Abyss like - darkness envelopes my glass! Two fingers of tan head sit atop the blackness and eventually fade away to about one finger. 
S: Dark coffee and roasted malt dominate the aroma, with hints of chocolate, molasses, oak, and vanilla in the background. Overall, the aroma is really heavy on the roasted character and not much else. 
T: As with the nose, flavors of dark roasted malts and burnt coffee dominate the flavor. A good amount of bitter dark chocolate, thick molasses, and oak also comes through. 
M: Thick and full bodied. I found the finish to be kind of harsh with a large dose of burnt coffee character and stinging alcohol. 
D: It's not bad by any means, but not nearly as good as I was expecting. Both the aroma and flavor was a little one dimensional for me - both being dominated too much by dark malt and coffee bitterness. I'd love to get my hands on another bottle and see what a year or two does to this. 986 charactersMrDanno96, Apr 13, 2010
3.95/5  rDev -11.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 42009 Vintage - On tap at Father's Office (note: this review written froma few months ago). 
Into a tulip, pours a thick and creamy chocolate head atop an impenetrable body. The head dies rapidly yet reemerges quickly upon agitation. 
Aromas range from oak-y vanilla to cocoa. A deeper breathe yields some alcohol/booziness, which is not surprising considering the strength of the beer and the lack of aging. 
Coffee bitterness and molasses coats the palate and punishes it with delight; however, so does the aforementioned booziness, which primarily surfaces on the finish. 
The overall mouthfeel is thinner than I would have liked, but full and viscous as I swish. 
Overall, Abyss 2009 is good, but not close to the sublime experience of the 2008 vintage, which I had on tap with some age at Pizza Port San Clemente. Hopefully the former will approach the wonderfulness of the latter as it matures. 904 charactersjminsc76, Apr 12, 2010
4.13/5  rDev -7.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Review from BeerAdvocate Magazine March 2007
Barrel aging is still the rage right now, though most brewers stick with very limited releases. This is what Deschutes Brewery has done with The Abyss, an Imperial Stout aged in French oak and bourbon barrels.
No light will ever penetrate this beer--it redefines pitch black. An absolutely stunning brown head rises slowly and clings to the glass for a long time. Dark bak- er's chocolate, faint anise, prevalent oak with vague vanilla, and a faint yet sharp char aroma. Viscous, smooth, syrupy body. Heavy hand of roasted and burnt malt, but not overwhelming. Anise and vanilla are modest but noteworthy. Tart black-currant fruitiness meets a small but wild fruity ester. Creamy malt undertone, middle to end, with a warming alcohol in tow. Sugges- tions of burnt toffee and sweetened espresso come to mind. Small push towards a long, lingering, semi-acrid finish.
No pun intended, but the sheer depth of The Abyss is more than remarkable. This beer is a good example of American brewers coming into their own and bringing it to the table. Oh, and one bottle is not enough. Buy a case; drink one now and cellar the rest. Stack this one up against rosemary-grilled lamb chops and roasted, maple-glazed acorn squash. 1,263 charactersBeerAdvocate, Apr 07, 2010

This beer pours black as night with some slight reddish highlights and thick, foamy light brown head. Immediatly on the nose you pick up both sweet and roasty malts followed by dark fruit, wood and alcohol. The palate follows the aromas, however, along with the malts, dark fruit and wood there is a suprising amount of coffee. The bitterness is well balanced with thte sweetness. It is heavy and full bodied with a great crisp carbonation 498 charactersWhatsNewinBooze, Apr 05, 2010

A= Poured jet black with reddish brown highlights and a 3/4" light brown head. Opaque. Head settled to a skim and left some streaks and spots of lace down my glass. 
S= Malt richness, both sweet and roasty, lead the way. Dark fruit, alcohol, wood, and alcohol all made an appearance too. Very complex and heady. 
T= Closely followed the aroma. More coffee than I expected, supporting the chocolate bitterness as it did battle with the sweetness of the malts and the complexity of the ripe fruit and alcohol. Finished with an alcohol kiss and lingering complexdity. 
MF= Heavy body with a surprisingly crisp carbonation level (surprising for the high viscosity that is). 
D= Extremely drinkable for such a bold high gravity beer. I think I actually prefer it from the bottle over on draught, but it was still incredible. 915 charactersspointon, Apr 05, 2010

Overall it an outstanding beer, one of the best's I cant wait for another one. dark color, rich deep malts and mahogany flavors and taste. Coffee and oak barrel bourbon tastes..perfect.

4.55/5  rDev +1.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Poured from a 22 oz., 2009 reserve bomber into a Dogfish Head signature glass. I may be doing this beer a huge disservice by drinking it so long before its drink-after date, but I'm a huge proponent of being able to drink beers at any time, so here it goes. 
Appearance: As it pours, the beer doesn't look terribly black; rather it's a darker cola color. Once the glass is filled, it becomes an ominous, abyssal black that sucks in all the light around it. The beer is crowned by an equally dark and impressively thick head, that takes an eternity to dissipate. Appearance-wise, this is the quintessential imperial stout. Additionally, there is a pretty high amount of lacing on the glass for a powerful stout. 
Smell: The Abyss has an unbelievably deep and complex nose to it. There is a huge, syrupy and thick smell of fudge brownie malt that is probably most prominent scent. There is some chocolate to found somewhere in the background, as well as some vanilla, which I suspect is a product of the oak aging. There's also a creamy, milky sweet smell in there somewhere, and just a tinge of alcohol. 
Taste: The first sip tells me this is going to be a great beer. Despite being very young, the beer is exceptionally smooth and well-refined. Th first tastes to greet your palate are some imperious fudge malts and a fair degree of roasted malt. The oak (and hence vanilla) is very present in the taste just in case you forgot this was barrel aged. 
The hops are probably the most impressively incorporated taste, in my opinion. There is just the correct amount of resinous, piney hops to counter the immense sweetness of the malts and oak. The hops don't go overboard, though, and leave no cloying on your palate like some lesser stouts have the tendency to do. I'm not sure, however, if I'm willing to give this beer the ultimate score, as the taste is not supremely bold. 
Mouthfeel: The Abyss is an appropriately thick but not a chewy example of the style. The mouthfeel makes up for this lack of body by being astoundingly silky and smooth, however. It is also just about as crisp as an imperial stout is going to be. 
Drinkability: This is a nice-drinking stout but I'm definitely taking my time in getting through this bomber. As it warms, the alcohol starts to make its presence known, but not necessarily through direct taste. Rather, the alcohol provides a nice warming sensation as time goes on. Despite this, the beer is exceptionally smooth and each sip is a pleasure that goes down easily. 
Overall, this is definitely a top-tier beer. It's extraordinarily smooth but it's smoothness is not matched in boldness, which prevents this beer from achieving the ultimate taste score. That being said, this is definitely a phenomenal beer that is masterfully put together. As I mentioned earlier, I'm sure this beer could do with some time in the cellar, but as it is, this is a great beer. 2,906 characterszoso493, Mar 26, 2010

Amazing cherry cola and black appearance. Tiny bubbles. Choco aroma. Vanilla. Cinnamon. Minimal coffee. 
Very small amounts of licorice, maybe molassess additionally come out taste wise in addition to the aforementioned. Cherry too. Just loved this throughout. Very drinkable, but pricey. But hey, $11 at the bottle shop, $17 at a bar is a good deal relatively speaking.

I keep having this beer, and it just keeps getting better. Its in that Bigfoot category now where I buy a case of it every year. Delicioso!

A moderate pour generates a light sucking black body with a dense,

beautiful multicolored lace down with it.
Nose is all over the place. Molasses, sweet milk and dark chocolates,
rich oak, light bourbon and oak notes, vanilla, chocolate chip

shake sweetness underlying everything.
Licorice, molasses, anise, pine needle hops, toasted coconut, dark

'08 vintage.
A - Jet black, nice tan head bubbled up on the pour and stuck around for a little bit. Nice lacing throughout the drinking.
S - Charred malts, nice and oaky. Get the coffee notes very strongly, hints of cocoa. 
T - Very roasty coffee comes out right off the bat. The licorice taste is subtle, but present. Dark chocolate hints meld nicely with the molassas, a lot of tastes going on, but none of the overpowering. The wood is mild, but noticable, and mixes well with everything else.
M - Good carbonation on a nicely thick stout. Viscous, just a little sticky. Good stuff.
D - Pretty good for a big stout with this much alcohol. Definately a top contender, but I don't rate it as highly as a few other stouts I've had. Would enjoyably drink again. 848 charactersAgentZero, Mar 21, 2010

I can't remember who sent me this, so thank you very much.! Served this at cellar temperature, in a snifter, from a twenty two ounce wax capped bottle. 
Appearance: The Abyss pours out a deep, dark as night black, that is similar to, well, an Abyss.. A somewhat vigorous pour resulted in two fingers of dense, creamy, coffee brown head. Great retention here, lasted almost throughout the experience. Left a thick, sticky coating of lace on the glass. What a great looking brew. 
Smell: Awesome nose on this beer. Quite complex. Deep, almost smokey malt aromas. Slight hints of coffee and chocolate. Definitely some licorice in there, and just a touch of bourbon and oak. Getting some molasses and char in the end. A bit spicey.
Taste: I didn't think this brew could get any better, but it did. Rich, complex flavors make up this beer. Very assertive roastiness starts out this beer beautifully. A bit of roasted coffee beans and some good dark chocolate. Just the slightest hoppiness. The molasses and licorice stand out a bit in the taste. Some oak and some bourbon are noticed as well. A bit smokey. Alcohol is there, but for the most part is hidden behind the thick layers of flavor. Still warms as it goes down though. This much better than fresh. 
Mouthfeel: Great thick, creamy, smooth as silk full bodied mouthfeel. Lower carbonation fits this beer perfectly.
Drinkability: Quite drinkable, but watch out. The Eleven percent ABV will get you. A very well crafted brew. 1,493 charactersjaxon53, Mar 14, 2010

Reviewed cold from a bottle to a glass
A - Black in color like coffee with a finger of foam at the head and a tanish/reddish ring of lacing. Couldn't tell how much lacing is present
S - Strong malt aroma, coffee and bits of fruit in the mix, Sweetness lingers, kind of like chocolate and black licorice
T - Full bodied, warming feeling after the first sip. Maybe too cold out of the gate but after it had warmed up a lot more of the flavors came through. Coffee, dark chocolate, maybe some licorice. No real hop presence seems hidden pretty well. 
M/D - A nicely aged 2007, still full bodied with a strong malt flavor with the right amount of coffee and dark chocolate. Highly recommend this brew. I had it with some time on it and hope to try a fresh batch someday and update the review 845 charactersFreshmanPour77, Mar 08, 2010
4.88/5  rDev +8.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Pours from the bottle like unrefined oil... black as a deep night. What a sight!
The smell from this is very subtle but bold once you really get your nose in there. Licorice, molasses, and roasted malts are dominant.
The taste... espresso certainly! Cocoa, a little vanilla, toffee, some black fruits, slight alcohol. All in all, very smooth; dangerously so I must admit.
If heavy cream had an evil and dark brother this would be it! This stuff just coats your mouth in a very good way. Carbonation is perfect for the style. 
Epic IS! At the top of my long list of favorites. Only have 3-4 left... must resist urge to drink them all right now! Can't wait for the next though. Should age really well. Would love to a vertical taste with these. 746 characterselliot23, Mar 07, 2010

T: Yeah... This is what I have been looking for all of this time in an imperial stout. Coffee, chocolate, dark fruit, and molasses, with just a hint of the licorice. Oak is faint, and the aging lends a nice hint of vanilla. The hops are actually subtle, but still present, drying out the finish.
M: This is liquid velvet! Full and rich, this beer coats the palate and does not go away. Warming and extremely smooth.
D: For it's strength and body, The Abyss is very easy to enjoy. Hands down, the best Imperial Stout I have ever tasted to this day. 963 charactersWYVYRN527, Mar 06, 2010
4.35/5  rDev -2.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Smells of lactic acid, slight coffee, dark chocolate, and raspberries. 
Starts with kind of an acidic bite and coffee then moves into sweet caramel and vanilla flavors. This is all rounded off with a myriad of chocolate flavors and booze. Bitterness is apparent yet soft. 
Actually a little more attenuated than expected. Carbonation is also a little high. I like this as it increases digestability in this big assed beer. 
Well worth seeking out. Complexities found only in the best Imperial Stouts. Highly recommended. 523 charactersbosco7, Mar 05, 2010
4.45/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Big thanks to Kevin and Karen for sharing this one. Big coffee, with everything else coming after that. Smooth, partly due to the oak-aging I'm sure, with some other more subtle tastes around it, mostly chocolate. 
Re-rate: 2006 bottle. This is like an entirely different beer, so smooth, well-blended, and delicious. 318 charactersPawel, Mar 05, 2010
4.08/5  rDev -8.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 42007 bottle.
Thick, thick black pour, with about a finger of mocha colored foam. Nice rings of lacing on the glass.
Sweet, lightly bitter nose. Black licorice, molasses, roasted barley, vanilla, and a light boozy touch from the bourbon.
The heat I noticed in the nose is never present in the flavor. Little bit of soy, then a nice sweet touch of licorice, molasses and chocolate balance nicely with lots and lots of coffee-like roast.
Nice, thick body. Surprisingly easy drinker. Will have to compare notes with an 08 bottle. 529 charactersGyle41386, Mar 04, 2010
4.72/5  rDev +5.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Picked this up at the Brown Jug, Anchorage. Poured into wine glass.
Appearance: Black color with tan head. 
Smell/Taste: Vanilla, Cocoa and caramel sweet notes, warming sensation that is smooth and holds taste for awhile. Deep dark flavors with a cover of whiskey/bourbon.
This was not as thick as I had imagined it would be like the Berserker, so I have to admit the drinkability was pretty awesome, overall great beer! 423 charactersrandawakes, Mar 03, 2010

A - Pours a dark brown/black color with good head.. great lacing.. a very good looking stout.. 
S - Smells pretty impressive.. chocolate coffee smell lets you know that you are in for a treat.. definitely a dessert smell.. something you know is not a session beer but just for a nice occasion..
T - Not super blown away.. Just a very good stout.. I think it may be a little over hyped. I still say this is an A beer and worthy of great acclamations; however, I think many good stouts can compare to this. Very complex chocolate coffee taste with alcohol very well hidden. this is a great brew no doubt.. 
M - thick, chewy, good carbonation.. 
--- edit on 12/20/10 - reviewed 2009 edition
the worst feature of this great brew.
T - This was very good. I don't know if it's supposed to be even better?? Def no drainpour here. It was so awesome. Taste the molasses and the sweetness here. You get the oak and just a ton of flavor. I would rate it super high here with no alcohol taste.
M - It was thick but not too thick. I liked it a lot. 
D - I had no problem taking down a glass of this and am thankful smutty33 split it with me. Awesome brew and I have no clue if it was infected, but it was an A beer nonetheless.
D - I wouldn't want many of these as it tastes like something I would just want with dessert.. it's a powerful heavy drink.. alcohol is hidden very well.. i'm glad i got to try this!! much thanx to smutty33 for sharin this one! Cheers! 1,481 charactersTomdee74, Mar 03, 2010

4.52/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Descutes "The Abyss" 2009 vintage wax top
Appearance: A hard pour yeilds a large head with oily bubbles that are shining on like crazy diamonds. She is pitch black with garnetlike highlights. Yellowish brown head that provides some lacing along the glass.
Smell: Initial waves of Chocolate. Some mocha/coffee notes. Dirty, roasted malt. Smoke. The aroma is full of complexity. Alcohol comes though as it warms. Everything comes together and smells quite inviting.
Taste: Well hello there. Molasses are apparent right away as well as a strong roasted chocolate malt flavor. Wood/Oak flavors come out a bit. A slight earthyness on the back end, could be the hops. There are many levels of flavor. Some pine notes come through and a hint of spearmint. Vanilla and raw cocoa as it warms. Definately oaky and thats just fine. Lived up to hype/expectations.
Mouthfeel: Full bodied with sizzling carbonation and some mild astringecy. Warming alcohol present early on in this endeavor but not overpowering. Roasted coffee finish and very smooth after some gentle swirling. Finish is drying.
Drinkability: While I would love to sip on this all day (and its been a solid hour) I would have to rate this as merely "good". Its strong flavors are wonderful but it is a big assed beer! Though short of perfection, this beer is a legend for a reason. 1,340 charactersStinkypuss, Mar 01, 2010

Aroma is dark coffe, dark malt, some hot bourbon.
Flavor is burnt and dark, lots of roast almost gives it slight tart quality. Finishes a little light and fairly dry.
Had this a year ago and didn't review, wish I had, that bottle was leaps and bounds better than this one, will hold the bottle for a while and try this again. 401 charactersSShelly, Feb 27, 2010

4.53/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Ok, bottle was tried in 2007, I didn't review one in '08 (good luck finding this in India), so when I saw this on tap at Vine Street Pub in Denver, I fainted. Then I ordered one.
8oz. 
But of course, black pour. Ruby tints on the edge after I drank about half. Not much head due to pour. Great lacing, a bit filmy
Slight boozey nose. But a lot going on. Chocolate instant, then anise and molasses. Coffee in there and dark unripe plum. 
Boozey taste a bit. Taste follows aroma. A 'juicy' taste to it. Seems the chocolate is melted and coffee is fresh. Not too powerful, they blend well. Vanilla and caramel come in and say 'hi' then quickly leave. Very slight woodiness, too. 
Warming, but not burning. Very easy drinking with enough booziness to remind you that if you drink it too fast you may fall...into the Abyss (oh, that's cheesy) 840 charactersMebuzzard, Feb 25, 2010
4.88/5  rDev +8.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Edit: adding notes from a recent tasting, but leaving my original scores from my 02-27-2009 review, which is further below.
2007 vintage consumed on 02-22-2010 (almost a year after the previous review):
appearance was much the same as i remember (nearly identical to black tuesday and marshal zhukovs as well), deep black with a creamy tan head that is just a touch lighter than black tuesday).
coffee roast and toast, and that same pretzelly smell from before.
taste is smoky, a bit acrid, big and roasty, underneath that is the stated molasses. ashy.
mouthfeel is big and milky. substantial, but a tad bit chalky, which may just be an effect of the ashiness in the taste.
drinkability could be a lot better (and has been much better in my experience with the 2008).
luckily this isnt the first time ive tasted the abyss. id be quite disappointed. this one still retained some good qualities (appearance and mouthfeel), but fell pretty short of matching what i remember the abyss to be. oh well! next beer...
2008 vintage reviewed on 02-27-2009:
i figured id make this my first review. now.
my memory is something funny so we will see how this goes.
beavers poured two super snifters and a tulip of this. for himself, sean, and i. i had one of the snifters. about half an inch of head, looked beautiful, a pillow of consistent medium-sized bubbles that disappeared about halfway through drinking, prompting some swirling towards the end.
so ill just throw this out there: im not totally in tune with all the wonderful tastes that i read and hear about, so maybe youll know some of the things im talking about -- that i dont exactly.
let it warm up a bit in the glass. smelled. 
i smell something that reminds me of alcohol, but isnt an alcohol that im familiar with. something that hits far up in the nose, separate from any other scent im perceiving. cant place it. this was not a bourbon or whiskey alcohol though, to me. whiskey is my favorite spirit and i picked up none of it here.
i also pick up -- i would say -- 10% of the scent is pretzel. a salty doughy smell. just like pretzel.
no traditional alcohol taste.
a texture that makes me think of either thick milk or a light cream. half and half? i also get confused as to whether i taste this, feel this between my tongue and the roof of my mouth, or both. its very pleasurable. mmhmm!
the same amount of pretzel that i smelled comes through in the taste. i dont pick it up every sip, but when i do, it is pronounced.
brown sugar was also brought up. i agree it is there.
the typical dark fruits as well, although very much in the back of my mind, or perhaps actually not very present in the beer anyway. there are other new and unusual things to pay attention to and think about, that these dont really register.
the following aspect was a combined effort at extracting, and one i was hesitant to bring up to the company i was enjoying this with... about midway through, the beer warming slowly, i noticed a nursing home urine smell, and when drinking, a nursing home urine taste. not prominent, but certainly present. now this may sound kind of bad (which is why i at first wanted to wait til we were done drinking to talk about it), but i want to express: this wasnt a bad thing. we talked through it and came to the conclusion that it was not so much urine as it was the chemicals or solution used to sterilize it in places like nursing homes. and then finally, that it was the smell of a numbing agent used on the inside of your elbow before you get a shot. so that is that. again, this urine/sterile mixture is not bad, but not heaven. and it is there. slightly. but noticeably. 
so. 
eleven percent -- imperceptible. 
texture is super creamy and delectable. swallowing feels wrong, as this texture is quite perfect and silky. wheeee. so i would give mouthfeel a six actually.
so easy to drink.
brings up great memories of nursing home visits involving bingo, youth group people singing carols, and body parts sagging below the bottom of one persons normal, waist-length shirt. 
what could be better? 4,074 charactersCrittervision, Feb 24, 2010

4.75/5  rDev +6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Review #500! My first milestone worth noting, and what better beer to review.
Got this bottle in a trade way back when with DeaconBluez. Thanks Chip a ton for this long time mega want!
2008 Vintage, one of my most looked forward to beers in a long long time.
Pours pitch black, absorbing all light cast into it much like a black whole. Thick like motor oil, leaving a nice brown film around the glass. Lighter head than I expected, sort of a dark khaki color. It has excellent retention and leaves very nice lacing.
This is roasty, chocolatey, sweet and bitter, fruity and rich. Incredibly complex and all the individual components work together to form one incredible smelling brew.
Rich and flavorful, with vanilla and bourbon, an earthyness, sweet and roasted malts, chocolate and toffee, dark fruits and so much more. Maybe the single most complex RIS I've ever had the pleasure of trying.
Thick and heavy bodied, rich and creamy. Everything a RIS should be and more. Drinkability is amazing considering the amount of flavor and alcohol. This is one to sip and savor, enjoy for the entirety of the drink, as it's a priveledge to drink it, not a right, and it's gone before you know it.
An absolute fantastic RIS, one of the best I've ever had. I don't think I could have chosen a better beer to have at 5pm on a Friday for my 500th review. This is truly a treat, and I look forward to seeing how my other bottle, a 2009, changes over time. 1,450 charactersMistofminn, Feb 19, 2010
4.6/5  rDev +2.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5The Abyss has a dark brown almost black in color with a dark brown brown head with little retention. The aroma is of roasted barley and rich coffee. This stout imparts an intense coffee flavor on your palette with minor hints of chocolate. There is very little carbonation which allows for the coffee flavors to really stand out. This is one of the few reserve series that Deschutes puts out that you can really taste the heat. There's not a lot of residual sugar to mask the 11% ABV so despite its looks, it rolls through the mouth with a light body feel. Overall though I think this is another great reserve beer from Deschutes and I can see myself drinking it whenever I have the option. 690 charactersTheBeerCarl, Feb 19, 2010
4.4/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Pours a dark chocolate black with a dark tan head. 
Strong smell of Chocolate, roasted malts, tobacco, oak, residual sweetness, some licorice, and definitely some hop presence.
Taste of ashy sweet malt, milk chocolate, caramelized sugars, a tiny slightly astringent / tannic flavor from black patent as the tongue dries. Tobacco not tasted since Adam from HOTD. As she warmed vanilla definitely became more strongly spoken as with the nice oak character. The oak is not overdone, and I like that only a third of the beer was oaked as it lends itself to a more mellow oak flavor. The bourbon is almost masked entirely by the oak and dark malts, even though I love bourbon, this beer tastes much more mellow than many other bourbon barrel aged beers I have had lately. So much so that the bourbon aspect is nearly unnoticeable. Sprecher Scotch Style bourbon barrel and Brooklyn Black Ops come to mind in this category. This is a well put together Stout with nice balance. 971 charactersalpinebryant, Feb 19, 2010
4.76/5  rDev +6.2%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I acquired this beer from my first ever trade. Big thanks to Beerisheaven for this one and for a great experience that led to many more for me. 
A: Poors black as the abyss (lame but i had to do it). About an inch of brown head that actually stayed around for a while. As I drink it there is nice retention and it is leaving traces of itself down my glass.
S: Savory roasted malts... coffee, chocolate. Soft oak and vanilla, there is a bit more going on I just can't figure it out. Dark sweet prunes or raisons also. 
T: Amazing blend of so many things that combine so perfectly. A vanilla oakeyness (is that a word?) gives way to a sweet chocolate that then fades into a burnt bitter coffee taste. Another sip gives me a dark fruit liquorish taste. As the flavor left in my mouth is that of the dark fruits, burnt malts and tobacco. 
M: Full bodied, just the right amount of carbonation for this beer. It is thick and creamy and coats the mouth for long after you have finished the sip. The only beer I've had that is more full bodied, creamy, and silky then this is 08 DL which i had last night. 
D: 11%... I can tell a liar when I see one, there is no way this is true. There are the slightest hints of the alcohol but in no way are they harsh. I am going to finish this bottle with ease and struggle not to open an 07 and 09 to go along with this. 1,356 charactersBS68280, Feb 17, 2010

A natural beauty. Dark brown tan fingers, chewy brown black. nice carbonation, head sustains well
S malty, yeasty, sweet savory, dank cave. the dank smell is very enjoyable and unavoidable. 
T intense and varied. Mid roast coffee, costco muffin studdle icing, artifical yeast taste. sweet hint of bourbon and oak. maybe maple and birch, reminded me of the life and limb, but just hints.
M mid heavy, but not overtly robust in feel. sip and think beer, quite thought provoking

4.77/5  rDev +6.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Pitch black head with a dark brown head- really good looking stout. Aroma holds cocoa, vanilla, cream, oat, molasses, anise, and a bit of oak. Nothing too aggressive on the nose, but smells delicious. Flavor holds lots of burnt sugar, ash, roasted malt, coffee, chocolate, caramel, and a definite milk or cream aspect to it. Alcohol, bourbon, and oak comes through at the finish as well. The burnt and charred flavor at the start is really delectable, and that same quality is what makes the finish and aftertaste so appealing. Palate is extremely smooth and immensely easy to drink for an 11% impy. Top notch imperial stout. 625 charactershophead247, Feb 15, 2010

2009 vintage
This was tasted after a KBS (my favorite stout).... I started off a little skeptical. However, this won me over as it warmed. Nose is complex for sure, goes along with the stellar taste. All of the flavors melt together into one indescribable taste. It's a combination of roasted malts, chocolate, licorice, coffee, bourbon, vanilla, and an unknown smoky/spicy flavor. It also has a little bitter dark chocolate finish. This beer holds all the flavors so well. Abyss deserves the hype, and is one of the top stouts around. 593 characterskhumbard, Feb 13, 2010
4.83/5  rDev +7.8%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Had this as part of the Central New England BA meetup #1.
A: Super dark, light can't even escape it's grasp. Pours with the viscosity of dark matter in liquid form. I swirl it a bit, and see legs so long it would make Cheryl Tiegs blush. A small but very dark thick head rises on the pour and seems to sit there, enjoying the beverage on it's own.
N: Loaded with roast and chocolate. I think I could give it to a few bakers and they would be satisfied for years. The rich stout aroma it gives off also adds a nice touch.
T: Taste is just, ooohhh, ahhh! Super rich, creamy, thick, dark, delicious. Again tons of bakers chocolate and roast, but also adds some dark chocolate, a little milk chocolate, tobacco, coffee, toast, a slight booze, and that aged stout smooth flavor. I think Marlboro cigarettes would love this beer in their commercials. It's so thick and rich it just seems to fill the pours all over my mouth and lingers with the deliciousness. Semi sweet with some malty flavors as well.
M: Thicker than blood, which is in turn thicker than oil apparently. Very little carbonation, good for the style, but so thick I think I need to chew it before i swallow.
F: Looong lingering roast and chocolate finish, as it coats the mouth well. It's still semi sweet, with more bakers chocolate and milk chocolate at this point. It also has a bitter stout like earthy roasted char flavor.
Amazing stout, perhaps my favorite now. It's very good, hides the booze well, and is much more drinkable than Black Tuesday or Dark Lord. 1,532 charactersjlindros, Feb 12, 2010

2008 Vintage. This is it. One of the most fantastic RIS's ever. I am privileged to have acquired a good sample of this. Blackest of black, a black hole into which light is forever drawn in and spit out in the form of a tannish head that clings to the glass. The depths are endless and I am taken down into the rich, roasty, and vanilla aromas that swell around me. The chocolate and deep blackberry tones are abundant and mix well with the hints of licorice and bourbon. Rich and intense, sweet and powerful, this beer is certainly one to covet and savor. Such a treat. 589 charactersDmanGTR, Feb 10, 2010
4.67/5  rDev +4.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to drgonzo3705 for the 11/08 bottle of the Abyss. Cellared for about 1 year. I cracked it open in celebration after SB XLIV. 
Pours a pitch black with a 2-finger cafe au lait head. Just a ring of retention remains. Minimal to moderate lacing. 
The smell is strong of sweet, black forest chocolate cake along with caramel, molasses, earthy hops and there's a boozy quality too. The taste starts with sweet roasted malts but there's are strong flavors of molasses, dark chocolate, and coffee. There's an earthy & citrusy taste in the end. The creamy, full-bodied mouthfeel is balanced well with the carbonated, alcohol-warmed booze. 
This is a drinkable stout. Completely lived up to it's top stout billing. The taste was a little more bitter than I like but the smell & flavors are so remarkably apparent that this can be overlooked. A bit strong in the ABV area to be sessionable. It pairs well with chocolate desserts. 929 characterstheghost3, Feb 09, 2010
4.72/5  rDev +5.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Big thanks to Alen for this one! First review, also!
09 Vintage Poured into a snifter.
Just so I can say to everyone. Good God was this wax the biggest pain in the ass I've ever experienced!
Appearance: Completely dark/basically black body (abyss, no?)
light carbonation that disappeared fairly quick but the lacing sticks fairly well. 
Aroma: Roasted chococlate, coffee, almost a piney coffee is the best way I can put it.
Taste: very strong roasted chocolate/coffee flavor. Tastes like it smells! Little alcohol flavor backing it, but still enough to taste it. It's an awesome balance of flavor with the heavy 11%. Taste rests on your palette long enough to know you just had an excellent brew. Even though the alcohol is hidden very well, it still warms on it's way down.
Mouth Feel: nice carbonation on the pallate. really feels nice to feel. a little bubbly, but still extremely smooth.
Drinkability: Really great sipper. Respect this beer. Had this by myself but would have loved to have shared with a friend. Knew this immediately after the first sip. Overall an amazing brew. Easy drinking so long as you know how to handle it. 1,142 charactersnickmooduh, Feb 08, 2010
4.56/5  rDev +1.8%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I'll tell you the problem with having a good beer bar with a secret tap on Abyss. They give it to you in a little 8 oz pour, out of the same keg cooler that hold a half dozen IPAs and ambers and the like, and is thus cold as Michigan in January. You cant wait to drink it, this nectar of delight and wonderment, but the chill is a black eye and that 8 oz just cant stand up to the time it takes to warm. You sit there, warming it in your hands and watching the girl in yellow play scrabble. She just misplayed the X, a loss of many points. I must occupy my time, and I cant drink the beer yet. Shit, its already half gone and its still cold. 
Finaly it warms, and you get to lick the goddess in full glory. Sulfur runs down your throat, coats the sides of your tongue, and pushes with might at your good nature. Licorice and smoke and oak and dates and brimstone all show up to the party, your mouth feels like a dark metal show, all the devils are out to play. It dances, it cavorts, it delights. These are the good days, and we should all be glad for that last 2 oz sip of perfectly warmed abyss. 1,099 charactersolympuszymurgus, Feb 06, 2010
4.75/5  rDev +6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 52008 vintage. Pours an opaque black color and does not let in any light whatsoever, not necessarily viscous though. Dark brown foam is fluffy and tight. Not overly great retention and leaves a smattering of lacing.
Nose is absolutely wonderful with baker's chocolate and cocoa leading the way. Hints of licorice come through and I am getting some vanilla and plums. Not overly fruity, which I like, and the hops seem like they have died off some in the past two years.
Taste is complex and varied, has a little bit of everything. Some wood, some fruit and some brandy-like alcohol notes. Malts are silky and chocolaty with even a little bit of toasty and nuttiness more typical of a porter...very nice. Hops are there and contribute a surprising amount of bittering on the finish. Very layered with the flavors continually unfolding on the tongue. Body is fairly medium for the style, but with as much flavor as this thing packs it has no impact on the mouthfeel whatsoever. There is absolutely nothing negative I can say about this beer. It is an incredible beer, one of the best beers I have ever had and probably the best stout I have quaffed. A must try. 1,160 characterstwiggamortis420, Feb 03, 2010
4.63/5  rDev +3.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.52009 Vintage. Thanks to BOLTZ7555 for his extreme generosity and beer advocacy that allowed me to enjoy this mind expanding brew!
This dark brujo of a stout languidly enters the chalice and fills it with a raw crude-looking beauty of a stout topped by a light brown head of fine foam that reduces to lively and bubbly amoebae, and a persistent ring. Oily lacicles are spread like tendrils along the route of the pour. Nice.
Were I too have all the fine and rare stouts I have been able to taste this past year in front of me for comparison, I think the aroma of this one would not stand out. It is a full aroma, with the advertised licorice, also coffee notes, dark chocolate notes, deep roasted barley notes, and a sweet yeasty smell. All of these are rounded by a gentle bitter, hints of earth and alcohol, that turn this bouquet into a complexly aromatic perfume of stout beauty. Still, I have smelled some real beauties lately, and this one is not the best of them.
The taste. On the AB bottle it says, "...you are not worthy". I have that feeling here and now, about The Abyss. I feel unworthy to review this. Unquestionably the finest stout I've tasted, perhaps the finest beer. It is near to perfection. I've let it warm from cellar temp. to near room temp. and am nearing the end of the bottle. It is so full flavored, so perfectly balanced, it is a matter of what it is not, as well as what it is. The molasses in it has melted into the mix, the licorice is just a whisp of flavor, the oak not strong, more a backdrop, the burnt and toasty notes just below the surface of the sip, dark chocolate not overpowering, a touch of tart from the yeast, a bit of spicy alcohol, and a delicious earthy bitter note that comes in at the end of the most delicious finish of any stout I've been privileged to enjoy. This does it poor justice, it is more luscious than my words can express. Unquestionably the best stout of my life. Abyss gets better with age? That's scary.
Mouthfeel is incredibly light, almost like it was on nitro, tastefully carb.'d, very clean cling from a very big beer, and a just right looong finish. I hope to drink a more drinkable impy than this, doubt I will. 
Drinkability is of the "best to have medical attention nearby" variety. Way, way too drinkable.
Impression: Never felt like this before about a beer. I know I am going to cry when the last of these four bottles is empty. Best stout I have ever tasted. 2,442 characterscavedave, Feb 03, 2010
4.48/5  rDev 0%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Vintage 09 bottle. Poured into a duvel tulip. Almost solid black unless held up to a bright lite and then u can see some brown around the edges. Massive black coffee flavors with some wood notes and molasses in the background. A little harsh on the alcohol but im told this lessens with a little age. Smell is faintly chocolaty coffee and hoppy mix but i get isopropyl alcohol more than anything else. One awesome stout. I cant wait to try some older versions. 460 charactershops1337, Feb 02, 2010

S: smells of sweet raisins licorice and suprisingly a little bit of funk maybe. 
T: starts sweet malty. Licorice and oak in the middle. Finishes with burnt malt and more oak that I didn't find in the smell. Just a little bit of bourbon as well. Very nice.

A: A 1" thick, dark cocoa brown head rises from an aggressive pour, then slowly recedes to some swirls of lacing. Pretty much jet black with some garnet highlights at the edges. 
S: I'm drinking this a bit too cold, but there is a faint hop aroma mixed with bourbon and chocolate milk. As is warms up more chocolate, some faint licorice and dates. Also some roasted nuts, a bit of charred malt, oak barrel, smoke and cocoa. This is an incredibly complex beer. 
T: Pretty delicious. A chocolate milkshake with some faint hops mixed with licorice in the background. This doesn't seem as nuanced as the '07 but way more drinkable fresh. 
M/D: Very thick and creamy with perfect carbonation. This is quite drinkable for an 11% abv imperial stout. 
O: It seems that this years version, the hops were more muted than last years, and more specifically the bitterness, which is a big improvement. Although I wished that there was a bit more barrel aroma and taste - that would have added even more depth. This will be great to age and see how it tastes in 1-2 years. 1,112 charactersJoeySchlitz, Jan 30, 2010

Finally got around to reviewing The Abyss after having it at several local tastings. Pours with an absolutely gorgeous, cascading head whose color was likely the inspiration for "Brown" when Crayola decided to include it in their crayon boxes. This stuff is serious eye-candy, as coffee-mocha bubbles cling to the sides of the glass and slowly retreat into the dark, inky Abyss below. Not perfectly opaque, as some ruby hints creep in at the edges, but who cares...there's a puddle of drool already. That puddle becomes a small lake upon each whiff of this magical elixer. Dark chocolates mingle with black licorice, gingerbread, and chocolate chip cookie dough, while earthy hops add a subtle spiciness to the aroma. 
Rich, dark chocolate fudge and sweet molasses coat the palate alongside a life-affirming hoppiness that, even after 2+ years, still gives Abyss a huge bitter kick that resonates with foresty, earthy goodness. Hints of charred wood and espresso in the background. The body is creamy, but a bite of booze and hops on the finish keeps the sippage slow. Abyss is why Deschutes is one of, if not THE, top breweries doing it today. Home run, slam dunk, touch down--all of the above...I need more.

4.48/5  rDev 0%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Tasted from a bomber from the 2008 Reserve.
This beer pours BLACK and it is completely opaque. The head is spotty and brown with a red tint. The first aromas that come to mind are molasses and cereal. Other aromas include carob, black licorice, and toasted oak with a little bit of an alcohol burn. To put things quite simply, this beer tastes almost exactly like it smells. The addition is the black espresso flavor on the back of the palate and the finish. The beer is extremely full bodied and oily. The carbonation is still very alive, but has a creamy texture. The finish lasts forever with a bitter coffee flavor. Overall, this beer is awesome! Exactly what I hope for in a huge stout.
***
Vertical Tasting on the Same Night, here are the notes on the 2009 Reserve. I know it says best after November of 2010, but I wanted to taste these two side by side.
Appearance (5) - Pretty much the same as the 2008.
Aroma (3.5) - Completely different...smells almost like a cola, considerably sweeter. Chocolate malt, fertile soil, and a brown sugar sweetness.
Taste (3) - This is really bitter...maybe overly so. Over-ripe plum, black pepper, carob. Bitter, bitter, bitter.
Palate (4) - Full bodied, not as oily, much fizzier carbonation. The finish still goes on forever.
Overall (3.5) - This is too young. The note on the side of the bottle should be heeded. That adds up to a total score of 3.7. 1,398 characterswedgie9, Jan 27, 2010
4.18/5  rDev -6.7%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4A - Dark rich brown color. Completely opaque, and a nice amount of lacing. The beer was poured into a snifter at the Deschutes Brew House in Portland Oregon. The bubbles actually had a brownish color to them. 
S - It has a great smell. Has a woody sort of aroma with some coffee. The smell is not overly strong, I would say it is just right. 
T - This has a very deep flavor. It losses some points for having a bit too much coffee flavor, and not enough molasses flavor. It does have a high ABV, but you can taste the alcohol a bit more than in other high alcohol beers I have tried. 
M - it feels good drinking this, although I prefer to sip it. You could take large gulps of this beer without a lot of trouble, but why waste the experience? Anyways, each sip is equivalent to two sips of a weaker beer. 
D - I had this beer with dinner and it complimented nicely. Not being a coffee lover made it a bit tough to get over the initial flavor, but I still enjoyed these beer. 
Bottom Line: Give this one a try if you ever have a chance. It is truly a complex beer. If you like the black butte porter from Deschutes, then you will probably enjoy this beer as well. 1,167 charactersLonghorn22, Jan 26, 2010
4.18/5  rDev -6.7%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 42009 Vintage, poured into a tulip. Beer is dark black and appears thick. Carbonation is mild. Beer is completely opaque even at the corners. Forms a thick and aggressive dark brown head that falls away relatively quickly leaving a lot of lacing on the glass. The resultant head is thin and diffuse and eventually breaks. A visage of the original head hung out in the middle of the glass for the duration of the beer.
The aroma is complex. There is a lot of sweetness, brightness, some alcohol, a lot of roast, malt and coffee, almost a syrup but not cloying aroma as well. There is a hint of anise in there as well.
Beer is medium to full bodied. Late roast taste followed by a strong aftertaste of bitterness and roasted malt. Definitely some espresso character. I was expecting a little bit of bourbon but got none. I did however get some warmth from the alcohol in the front of the mouth along with considerable gravity and sweetness. Overall its a good beer. Its not my favorite imperial stout but it is really good. Drinkability is good and mouthfeel is good too. I would be interested to see how this beer changes over time. 1,132 charactersdrabmuh, Jan 26, 2010
4.4/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4First you need someone to share it with. Then you need a tool to get the wax off. I prefer a Dremel tool with a 1/8" router bit. Then you can enjoy...
Aroma:
The dominant aromas of slightly burnt coffee, chocolate, and alcohol stick around but with each sniff new aromas emerge. Bourbon, molasses, licorice, prunes, keep searching...
Appearance:
Pours midnight black. Even when there's just a bit left in the glass you can't see through it. For a high ABV beer the Abyss pours a good sized head which is creamy and sorority girl tan in color. A resilient cap of foam about 1/4" thick protects the beer below all the way until the last few sips. Good clingy lacing. 
Taste:
Many of the aromas you smelled initially come alive on your palate. The velvety smooth heavy bodied beer entices you with chocolate, coffee, bourbon, prunes, molasses, indefinable malty sweetness and of course alcohol. The finish comes around to rescue you from the sweetness with bitter roasted coffee notes that linger long enough to be appreciated but not long enough to annoy. 1,056 charactersbirdypowder, Jan 25, 2010
4.97/5  rDev +10.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A big thanks goes out to redbrewer83 for trusting me in one of my first trades and sending this one out. 2008 reserve.
Poured into the snifters that I bought just for the occasion of tasting this beer with the proper glassware.
A: After hacking the wax off the top of the bottle and opening up the bottle, I grab the glasses. The pour comes thick and viscous that produces head only after the pour. The head is dark, thick, and creamy. The head dissipates very quickly, though not surprisingly at 11% ABV. Lacing is stringy and inconsistent, sliding back into the beer after some time. This is a welcome development, because it gives me a couple more drops of beer to drink.
S: Roasted tobacco goodness streams from the glass. I can make out an amazing oakey vanilla aromas as well. There is some muted caramel that linger in the wings with a bittersweet chocolate fragrance. There is a touch of alcohol as well, but it is not an astringent character in this beer.
T: WOW. This beer has an amazing level of complexity and balance. Nothing overwhelms or overshadows any other flavors in the beer. Initally, there is a nice taste of roasted tobacco, which is balanced beautifully with some coffee. The flavor then reveals a surprisingly well-developed oakey vanilla that works nicely with caramel notes that are extremely formidable for a component that didn't show up in the nose at all. Bourbon then comes through, adding a great layer to this beer, again, not stealing the show, which is usually a critical flaw of bourbon-aged beers. Chocolate is almost last among all of the other flavors, but it can come through in the middle if you really look for it. Aftertaste is oakey vanilla, tobacco, and coffee.
M/D: Creamy, smooth, viscous, and absolutely sublime. It slides over the palate and down the back with a nice dry finish. This is without a doubt the best RIS that I have ever had, though it may be more American Imperial Stout...This is deep, complex, balanced, and no single flavor becomes the focal point of this beer. I will definitely be trading for more of these as soon as the opportunity presents itself. 2,124 charactersNittanyBeerFan, Jan 24, 2010

A- Killer head on this bad boy- thick, fluffy, dirty brown head atop a molten puddle of primal tar. The great head mellows out to a quarter finger thick top. My god is this dark. Nice.
S- Whoa, spicy alcohol and hops are dominating the nose, but more deep inhales reveal chocolate covered rose petals, sugared pipe tobacco, strong perfumey notes, aged port, cheap coffee and holy christ I think I even smell hints of mint in here. 
This smell is beyond words-- so good and so complex and so damn deep. This is what Heaven's brewery smells like. I can't stop putting my entire face in the glass for another giant whiff.
T- Here we go...
The Abyss has a sprawling, evolving taste. First is sugar cookie- like sweet malts, than moving into Deschutes' perfectly balanced stout as the turning point, eventually flowing into a mild alcohol and bitter hops burn. Wonderful movement of flavors, and with such a perfect mouthfeel. The alcohol is quite present, however, more so than the BCS I reviewed days ago at a higher 13% ABV. I suspect the strong flavor of hops helps the warmth of this relatively strong stout. But I have to confess I am in awe of the sheer number of flavors and the way it transforms into something totally different at the end than what your first tasted. World class beer craftsmanship, ya'll. Your expertise is evident, and appreciated! 
Perfect 5 for taste, too.
M- Surprisingly a thinner body than I expected, but it seems to aid in the more delicate sweet flavors of the beer. Excellent structure and feel- very smooth texture with almost no carbonation for maximum silkiness. Yes, quite excellent.
D- Yet another fantastic imperial stout to lust after all year. The only fault I can find is in it's just-less-than-ideal drinkability-- the finish is quite intense and lingering, coats the tongue and mouth with sticky bitterness. 1,947 charactersSamN, Jan 23, 2010
4.62/5  rDev +3.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.52009 vintage poured into a pint glass.
Pour pitch black. No light comes through it. No head at all.
Smells of licorice, roasted coffee, chocolate, and roasted malt. Smell is sweet and pleasing.
Taking a sip, I get an initial taste of black licorice with a nice sweetness and a taste of bourbon. Followed by chocolate, roasted coffee, roasted malt, with a tiny hint of bitterness at the end. The alcohol taste is prominent, but I expect it would be more subdued with age.
Feel is not too thick, definitely not as thick as I'd expect. A decent amount of carbonation and bite on the tongue. Feels very slick.
Drinkability is medium-high. Definitely more drinkable than you might think. One is just right for me.
Overall this is an excellent beer. I was expecting slightly more from it, but that's only because there's so much hype. Definitely want to drink more of it if I can get some. 889 charactersghostee, Jan 23, 2010
4.74/5  rDev +5.8%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 42007 Vintage poured into a tulip
A-Black as night. Small mocha colored head that hangs around for a while then disappears leaving a bit of lacing. Its looks good, not exceptional.
S-Roasted malt, some coffee, licorice, whiskey/bourbon, dark fruit. I suppose time has tamed the booze a bit, so even at 11%, the alcohol is just a nice compliment and not a dominating factor. This smells exceptional. It is a very strong, yet pleasant nose.
T-Everything on the bottle is prominent: Oak, bourbon, licorice, molasses as well as dark fruit, roasted malt and coffee. It really is amazing that each flavor is bold, yet not overbearing. The aftertaste is of coffee and bourbon, which for me is a good thing. This beer is living up to the hype.
M-Creamy, viscous, slicks the tongue nicely, oily back end. Full bodied and delicious. I want to chew this beer.
D-For such a big beer, this is surprisingly (and dangerously) drinkable. I had no problem putting this bomber down and looked forward to each sip.
This beer is really hyped up so I was truly expecting to be let down. But I wasn't. This beer lives up to the hype. Is it the #3 beer in the entire world? I dunno. Others can debate that. I'll just say that this truly is a world class stout without question. 1,259 charactersLerxst, Jan 23, 2010

Sweet milk chocolate and roasted espresso hit right away. Not long off are vanilla, tobacco, oak and a hint of bourbon. 
Cocoa and vanilla rush in with a sweetness. Then it is nicely balanced out with the bitterness from the roasted malt. A slight touch of molasses. Don't detect the bourbon aging as much as in the nose with the exception of vanilla. The flavors here are not the most complex, but are done to perfection. 
A lot smoother than what I had expected. A very velvety mouthfeel. Wonderfully drinkable for the abv. Was not let down one bit and cannot wait for a couple of these bad boys to age. 705 charactersbfields4, Jan 21, 2010

A: Pours a deep black with a nice big dark brown head that fades to a ring and leaves some nice lacing on the glass.
S: The nose is dominated by coffee and roasted malt aromas. Smells like a coffee stout with not much else in there.
T: The taste is dark chocolate and roasted/burnt malt with subtle vanilla and molasses flavors on the finish. The sweet flavors balance out the dark roasty flavors pretty well.
M: The feel is medium bodied but kind of thin. Not the thickest stout but it's creamy and coats the mouth.
D: Pretty tasty but the aromas and mouthfeel seem a bit on the low end this year. I still plan to drink another after a year of age....hopefully it doesn't sour like the 2009 version.

2009 vintage 22oz bomber poured into a Brooklyn snifter.
A: Pours an inky black with a big creamy dark tan head that fades to a nice layering across the top and leaves excellent lacing on the side of the glass. Head retention was very nice.
S: The nose is complex with aromas of chocolate/cocoa, earth/tobacco, molassess, malt/grain, some dark fruits in the background, and very faint hops.
T: First tastes are dark chocolate/cocoa, vanilla, and a big roasty/hop bitterness. After a few sips the bitterness isn't that noticeable and more flavors come to the front. Dark fruit and molassess are evident as the beer warms.
M: The feel is thick yet not too thick and pretty creamy. Good carbonation.
D: I would probably only want one bomber in a sitting but I can't wait to see how this ages and plan to have it again in a year or so. I would definitely drink this all the time if I had access to more.
I was expecting slightly more out of this one but it was still very complex and tasty. The barrel aging isn't as noticeable as I thought it would be but it is a blend. The vanilla and dark fruit flavors really come out after this warms along with other flavors so let it sit a while. Definitely a sipper. 1,935 charactersGregSVT, Jan 20, 2010

Yep that is how it's supposed to look. Very murky and dark, small tan head with little to no lacing. The smell is very good as well and similar in taste. Heavy malt character up front. Oatmeal and whiskey with a touch of caramel. The nose has a bit more alcohol bit to it, but overall masks it pretty well. The mouthfeel is perfect, as well as the drinkability. 416 characterssupercolter, Jan 17, 2010

A- Black as the Abyss with next to no highlights. Pours with a frothy coffee ice cream colored head with a great mix of bubble sizes. The head recedes quickly but retains many of its bubbles. The head throws huge streams of lacing up the sides of the glass right away and does so throughout the drink.
S- Licorice, alcohol, roasted coffee beans, roasted barley and a subdued bourbon all play along in perfect harmony. There is a bitterness from the roast as well as an dark chocolate, ovaltine-like maltiness that lets me know I'm going to love this.
T- Malt balls, lactose milkiness, dark fruit and licorice, bourbon and roasted barley. These flavors all lead your mouth on a 30 second roller coaster ride, ending with a huge drop off into an intense roasted barley and roasted coffee bean aftertaste. Great complexity that makes me wait out the entire experience before I take my next sip.
M- Not as viscous as I was expecting. Medium bodied for a bigger stout with low to medium carbonation. 
D- So drinkable for such a high alcohol stout. Minimal alcohol burn, which I didn't even describe above, allows this to be consumed much quicker than a sipper. The mouthfeel invites bigger mouthfuls than is probably recommended. One of my most memorable stouts ever. Can't wait to try the other vintages. 1,385 charactersPecorasc, Jan 16, 2010

S- Lots of bourbon! Licorice and molasses really come through. Oak, vanilla, and some chocolate as well. Amazing aroma.
T- Very roasty! Lots of wood and bourbon. Almost getting a smokey wood flavor. Toasty malts. Some of the molasses comes through but roasty coffee dominates; especially after you swallow. The roasty flavor just sits on your pallet. Awesome beer.
M- Very viscous and oily. Great mouthfeel. So smooth and chewy.
D- After smelling this beer, and after my first sip, I thought this would be a sipper for sure. But I was wrong. The drinkability of this beer is actually very high. Overall, this exceeded my expectations! 774 charactersboothbeer, Jan 16, 2010
4.43/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 52009 bottle brought by Gonzoillini at a recent tasting
Poured from a 22oz. bottle into a tulip glass
It poured a impenetrable midnight black with a darker mocha 2 fingered head with large soapy bubbles resting on top.
The nose was pretty heavy on the roasty malts with a little bit of chocolate thrown in. A little bit of alcohol was wafting up as well.
The first thing I picked up was this pretty heavy fresh oak character; much more than I was expecting with only 33% being aged in oak. It had a decent amount of warming alcohol that was mixed in with pretty strong roasted malts. Not too much bourbon character but I was able to detect it when I went searching for it. After the glass warmed up closer to room temperature is when I was hit with a strong licorice taste.
I thought the carb was a little too high and a bit distracting. It also is noticeably thinner than many other RIS which in this case was a good thing that made it highly drinkable and not too filling by the end of my glass.
I would really like to pick up a bottle of this and have it in a year or two to see how it ages. Once the oak and alcohol mellow a bit more I can see this beer being mind blowing. 1,182 charactersweatherdog, Jan 14, 2010

4/5  rDev -10.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 42007 bottle thanks to CaptainCougar. Pitch black with a medium-small tan head. Sweet aroma with intense malt, caramel, burnt sugars, and roasted malt. Seems a little mellow, but at a couple years old, this was to be expected. The flavor is dryer than I expected with a roasty bite in the finish. Overall though, quite smooth with just a little more angular roast and a hint of alcohol towards the end. Rich all the way through with a light lingering sweetness. A touch of wood mostly adds to the dry feeling that I get, but bourbon is not at all evident, which I sort of like, but also doesn't seem to be adding anything positive. Medium-full in body with medium-low carbonation. Pretty nice stout, but not the most intense, good or bad. Mellow after a couple years, but still hanging on. I've really got to get around to cracking one of my relatively fresh '09 bottles to compare now. 885 charactersbulletrain76, Jan 12, 2010

Pours a black coffee color with a tan creamy head that rises well above the rim and shakes like jello. 
Smells of coffee and dark chocolate and maybe cinnamon.
Has a thick chewy mouth feel. Taste of bitter coffee and dark chocolate. Bitter hops come through and linger on the tongue along with the aftertaste of dark chocolate. Also has a cigar taste at the very end of that lingering sensation on your tongue. Also a slightly soapy flavor in there. 
Warming alcohol sensation sits on the palate. 
Very nice drinking beer. I could drink a few of these in one night although not back to back.
Thanks ditmier for the awesome trade. 666 charactersweissbierdrinker, Jan 11, 2010

Head is thin, but lasting, leaving spotty lace in it's wake. A layer of alcohol floats on top like a nice port. 
Aroma is pure black strap molasses, vanilla, creamy chocolate, and a faint wisp of alcohol.
Flavor is definitlely molasses, vanilla, toast, with some milk chocolate and toasty wood. Finsh is long and has a hint of anise. 
Creamy smooth mouthfeel, and no alcohol burn.

Nose- Roast malt, licorice, dark chocolate, coffee, vanilla and bourbon are all present and in that order of intensity. Slight booziness in the nose.
Palate- Roasty licorice, chocolate, coffee, boozy vanilla, and bourbon dominate. There is a caramel and molasses back bone present through out that tries in vain to balance this one out, but really only succeeds in taking the edge off.
Mouthfeel- Full bodied, medium carbonation, chewy.

Murky black and opaque body. Darker khaki head is produced, the height was not impressive though the retention was very good. The head eventually works its way back leaving a slight cap perched atop. Full sheet of lacing surrounds the snifter, clinging rather tightly to the sides.
The aroma is spearheaded by the darker smells. Dark cocoa and coffee smells lead into molasses and deep roasted malt. The oak and bourbon are more subtle though still present. Sweet boozy aroma works its way through, reminds me almost of a rather dark cherry liquor. Whiffs of smoke come in and out but not enough to be considered one of the more dominate smells.
Each sip is rather layered and complex. Dark chocolate with more of the dark cherry sweetness roll out first. The cherry tang is picked up again on the aftertaste. Rich espresso wand molasses follow closely behind. Vanilla flavor lingers, could be attributed to the oak though there is not a strong woody flavor. I have read several comments that the hops can be a bit obstructive on the younger bottles though I cannot see that at all. The bitterness pick up, while certainly could be the hops, comes of as more of a deep roasted coffee or dark chocolate bitterness. The bourbon is delicately placed and minimal in comparison leaving a somewhat sweet flavor. The alcohol is present but not to the point of being powerful or ever hot. 
The body improves as it warms. This particular bottle has been kept in the basement and served at the same temp, even the little temperature change helps. Full bodied and somewhat thinner than I would like. The lack of viscosity is most likely due to age and more time would have probably helped. Very smooth and creamy texture. The carbonation is moderate and does tingle the tongue on occasion. Slick and oily on the long with a rather long lasting finish. 
There was a debate for me on whether or not to open this or not. I am certainly glad I did. I have no doubt this would improve with age though it is not needed to be enjoyable. The flavors are incredibly enjoyable and layered to perfection. The alcohol is pleasant and rather well hidden. I will definitely be seeking this out again in later years. Fantastic beer. 2,260 characterskzoobrew, Jan 09, 2010

General review
A: Dark body that's basically black. Huge perfect whipped looking brown head with great retention and lots of lacing. 
S: Strong roasted malts with a molasses sweetness. Strong notes of bourbon and roasted coffee. This is a very strong scented beer with complexity.
T: So much happens on the first sip, it's hard to keep it all strait. Lots of roasted malts with molasses sweetness which is made stronger through the licorice. chocolate kicks in a bit, but is dominated by burnt coffee beans. There's a bit of a hop note, but not too much. I dare say perfection. 
M: Note extremely thick, at least compared to Dark Lord or any other big stout, however it's still very full bodied. 
D: Wow, for how big of a beer this is it's very drinkable. Usually with big stouts, I find it very hard to take down a bomber. This beer is easily drinkable by the bomber for one person, much more than I can say for anything else I've had of the style. 
I honestly believe this beer my be perfect after a year or two aging. 1,283 charactersAdmiralDiaz, Jan 09, 2010
4.48/5  rDev 0%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5A 2009 vintage, bought 4 bottles, wanted to try one fresh.
Beautiful pitch black beer, with a creamy, dark tan head. It just has the look of a serious beverage. I do think the wax dipping is cool to look at, but its really an inconvenience when the time comes to open it, a small piece of wax ended up in the beer... Not cool, not cool at all... 
Maybe my nose isn't that strong, but I barely got an aroma out of this beer. Only a very mild hint of burnt, charred grains. I wish it had a stronger smell to it. But then again, you don't brew beer to smell it...
Wow, this beer is complex and layered like few other beers. Starts off with the flavors of dark chocolate and espresso then slowly shifts into molasses and hints of licorice, which did not give as much bitterness as I expected. The Abyss leaves an aftertaste of vanilla, dried cherries, and burnt grains (which is a good thing for this brew). 
Very smooth and creamy mouthfeel, and doesn't have a thick or viscousy consistency that many other high abv beers have.
This beer has some room to age. The alcohol is present, but one might not guess it was 11%. That said its fairly easy to drink. It is quite tempting to open my other bottles, but I think the reward of letting these guys mellow out a bit will be well worth the wait. 1,295 charactersDoesntMatter46, Jan 08, 2010
4.25/5  rDev -5.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.52008 vintage poured into a large snifter to review.
Pour is rather thick. The head is ultra dense and a very dark brown in color (one of the darker heads I've seen). A thin layer of dark retention and great lacing. Black in color.
This is a complex and inviting nose. In order, I detect roasted malt, dark cocoa nibs, creme, oak, bourbon, smoke, leather and tobacco. All very intense, yet well balanced.
In the mouth is much more of a roasted coffee taste with very dark chocolate. As it warms, the creme flavors become more pronounced. Not detecting much of a molasses presence as indicated on the bottle. Also no licorice aroma or taste either to me. Alcohol well disguised in both taste and smell.
Very full body, thick and creamy, bordering chewy. Lightly carbonated and a long finish of nice roasted malt, fine coffee and dark chocolate.
A fine Imperial Stout that fits in with the best. 897 charactersibbjamin, Jan 07, 2010
4.55/5  rDev +1.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Impenetrable black rests beneath a mahogany brunette crown. The head refuses to back off, daring anything to try to enter.
I smell strong licorice, regardless of what other "Top Reviewers" say. There are dates, expired plum and a hit of bourbon.
The bourbon is more prominent in the taste, but is still in the finish just as a hint. Up front is chocolate bitterness, some coffee and vanilla. 
The mouth feel is watery yet very smooth. I prefer thicker, chewyer stouts, but I am amazed at how well this one glides through the mouth.
The drinkability is where this beer really shows its maker's talent. It is eleven percent all the while drinking so smoothly. Well done!
Thanks John! I really appreciate this one!
Edit: my first review was of a fresh 2009 The Abyss. Now, I am enjoying a 2008 The Abyss. I raised smell and taste to a 4.5 from 4.0. The smell is more complex than what I remember. The taste is superior to what I remember, also. In both there is the reminiscent smell of smores. It is bursting with chocolate, marshmallow, graham cracker, followed by the bourbon and oak. The feel is thicker than what I remember. This is such a smoother-well rounded- stout after a year and a half. Well done! 1,212 charactersJosephLondon, Jan 07, 2010
4.58/5  rDev +2.2%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Held on to this as long as I could (which wasn't very long) before I had to crack it open. Poured a deep dark opaque brown with a golden dark khaki head that changed into a lighter tan as it sat. Creamy, tiny bubbles and a solid two finger height on a less than vigorous pour. Head retention is excellent and it laces well.
Smell is very complex with multiple aromas with bitter chocolate leading the way, but a citrus sweetness follows with the licorice and bourbon notes as well.
Taste is equal in complexity to the smell with the bourbon more prominent, chocolate bitterness presents afterward along with some alcohol.
Mouthfeel is excellent, creamy and chewy with the extremely tight carbonation and alcohol warming.
Overall drinkability is limited by ABV only, but consistent with the style. If not for the potency, this balanced brew could be enjoyed for days. 870 charactersjacobseyb, Jan 06, 2010

A: Black as obsidian. A nice mocha colored head on top, which slowly falls into the glass, leaving a trail of lacing as it exits.
S: Oak is very present. Chocolate, and smoke. Picking up just a hint of the bourbon, but I pick up a lot more of the bourbon, and oak as this warms a bit.
T: Big. Malty, and burnt flavors up front, in the finish there are notes of dark chocolate, smoke, licorice, and a certain sweetness.. presumably from the molasses. Perhaps just a bit of a bite from the alcohol. As it warms, the bourbon is a bit more prevalent.
M: Thick, creamy and smooth. This beer is smooth like a milkshake, but the bite is all Imperial Stout. Carbonation is right on.
D: Man this is a tasty beer. So glad that I got to try it. And boy do I wish I had more. A fine brew, thick, creamy, delicious, and leaves me wanting much much more... 1,072 charactersBeejay, Jan 05, 2010
4.28/5  rDev -4.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 42008 vintage... Pours a deep dark, near black with beautiful khaki colored head. Great retention and lacing. Smell is an great earthy blend of dark cocoa, medium roasted espresso beans, vanilla, oak, sweet molasses with hints of spice such as anise. Taste is a touch more blended, smooth and mild then scent dictated, with all of the above charachters noted. The oak aging really makes this beer smooth, mellow and creamy, but feels thinner than i had hoped. Very good beer, but maybe didnt live up to the hype as much as i had hoped.
UPDATE: Upon revisting this brew, a 2009 vintage, I found the scent to contain less of the coffee and a chocolatey dark cherry and alcohol tone. Still pleasant, but different. Taste is a touch more aggressive at first, but as the palate is coated, the impact lessens. A bigger bozzy kick on the tongue, guessing this needs a little more age. The body is improved, thicker and more coating. Still a good beer, be interested to see how my other '09 tastes in a few months. 1,006 charactersrfgetz, Jan 04, 2010
4.41/5  rDev -1.6%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.52009 Vintage poured into a snifter. This is my first time having this sought after brew.
Appearance it poured pitch black with little cappucino colored head and nice lacing on the glass.
Smell was great, maltiness, oak, bitter chocolate and alcohol was upfront, I was a little dissappointed that the molasses and licorice was not as apparant.
Taste really delivered. I really noticed the bitter chocolate, oakiness and as it warmed subtle notes of bourbon, molasses and licorice became noticeable. I detected faint hints of toffee and fig as well. I was very pleased with the finish that is not too sweet compared to some of the other big stouts, which I prefer.
Mouthfeel was excellent, thick, chewy and coated the palette. 
Driankability was good, I thought it was a little hot and I suspect that with a little more age on the bottle I would have given this beer higher marks in this category.
I think the aging potential of this beer is exceptional. I look forward to revisiting this in about 1 year. This beer deserves it's ranking as on of the best on BA. 1,066 characterspmoore311, Jan 03, 2010

We did a vertical of '06, '07 and '08 and I'm reviewing the best of them being the '06.
A - Deep and dark brown/black. A smallish brown head is what I get.
S - Huge nose. Chocolate malts, Creamy smelling. Licorice.
T - Malty and chocolaty up front. Some sweetness up front. Delicious. black licorice, some bourbon. A long lingering aftertaste of chocolate and coffee.
M/F - Creamy and smooth wonderful. really an impressive beverage.

5/5  rDev +11.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Bought a 2009 bottle on a business trip to Oregon...didn't really know what I had until myself and my beer cohort opened it one Friday night. Getting into it is a bit of challenge (wax sealed without the help of a tab a la Maker's Mark) but once we were in this beer is easily top 3 of any beer I have ever had. Complex smells of vanilla, caramel, and coffee along with a thick and darker than basically anything else I have ever poured 
appearance. 
 Taste is strong but just not too strong as the 11% ABV is well hidden. I could taste the licorice right away. That and the vanilla notes are really what set this Imp Stout apart for me. I plan to get another few bottles of this beer if I can and age at least one to retry as I am told this will mellow out any of the ethanol taste that exists in a newer bottle. 
 Overall, aside from Rochefort 10 and possibly the Duck Rabbit Imperial Stout (which both hold a special place in my heart) I feel this beer is easily the most complex and interesting that I have ever consumed. 1,025 charactersrustymoore, Jan 01, 2010
4.59/5  rDev +2.5%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5'08 vintage. Shared w/dad as our beer to ring in the new year.
A- Body is a solid dark brown/nearly black hue with a slight tint of auburn to it. Pours with an approximately 1 finger foamy dark tan head that quickly subsides to a thin collar. Small traces of lacing are left in the glass. When held up to the light the hue does not change and no light passes through.
S- Magnificent. This truly has the perfect aroma for an imperial stout. Upon opening the bottle a sweet aroma came through of sweet molasses, vanilla, and mocha. These are the dominant aspects of the nose but there is also a hint of roasted malt. Not even a hint of phenols can be detected.
T- The flavor is mildly sweet and complex upfront. Vanilla and molasses are the dominant flavors upfront but oak and roasted dark malt flavors provide a very substantial backbone to mellow out the sweetness. The finish is sweeter with a rush of molasses caramel and vanilla which are quickly doused by a big roasted malt bitterness. Everything subsides and balances out in the end- Roasted malt is the highlight but vanilla, molasses, oak, and a mild alcohol heat are also present. 
M- Medium carbonation and a medium to heavyweight an ever smooth body.
D- This is a wonderful stout and one of the best that I have had. I see why it is ranked among the best. The best thing about it is the balanced character it portrays in the flavor...one of my new favorite imperial stouts...and I will be trading for it again. 1,477 charactersPittBeerGirl, Jan 01, 2010

Beautiful jet black beer that even when held up to bright light reveals only the faintest tawny edges.
Caramel sweet smell, somewhat dominant alcohol with chocolate coffee and hops. 
Flavor has complex chocolate coffee and burnt malts, very sweet yet drinkable, finishing with a nice bold hop bitterness.

A: Looks phenomenal. Completely dark with a decent 1 inch mocha colored head. Perfect.
S: Smells intensely boozy. Very smooth smelling with a dark fruit scent in the mix.
T: Very complex flavors. Immediately hoppy and boozy upfront. Hidden in the backround is some great oakiness, roasted malts, and slight hints of vanilla and cocoa. Very good, but not quite perfect.
M: Perfect! Amazingly smooth. Perfect balance of carbonation and smoothness.
D: Once you get past the booziness, it's awesomely enjoyable and goes down very easy.
All in all, this brew was great, but didn't really exceed my expectations. However, my expectations were very high. So, it rated very amazing. Good stout example. If you like your stouts hoppy and boozy, then this is your brew, dead on. 818 characterssteve8robin, Jan 01, 2010

2009 bottle provided by Exiled. 
Pours black with a brown head. The aroma is smokey oak with some roasted malt. The flavor is strong chocolate with some vanilla and licorice. Medium-thick mouthfeel. Tried this with Ghiradelli cocoa with a caramel center and it was amazing.

Aroma was more coffee and chocolate than in the 2009 vintage. The roasted malt and slight smoke were absent. The flavor was more of a milk chocolate with some vanilla. Overall, I think the 2009 was a little bit better but the 2007 was still a great beer. 780 charactersMora2000, Dec 31, 2009

The pour is black, super black. Beautiful brown head. The aroma is strong, coffee and chocolate notes, big roasted malt character. The taste is incredible and surprisingly refined, I assumed from the aggressive nose that this beer would be pretty rough on the palette, but its not.

Wanted to love this beer: appearance and smell are near perfect for a BA RIS, and the mouthfeel isn't too far behind, though a bit thin. But the 09 vintage has so much bitterness that gets in the way of an otherwise great RIS. So much so, it took me a long while to get through a single glass. I'll let some bottles sit for a while to see if the edges soften up and re-review at that time, but I'm clearly not in the majority with this one. 454 charactersjwjon1, Dec 28, 2009

A- 2007 vintage poured into a snifter glass reveals an opaque brew with two fingers of tan colored head. Excellent head retention and lacing. 
S- Lots of stuff going on here. Licorice, dark roasted chocolate and coffee, and some oakiness come through. No aroma really seems to dominate, a well balanced beer.
T- Lots of licorice flavors and also a bit of a roasted flavor. Not overly sweet, which was a welcome surprise. It seems like too many Imperial Stouts are way too sweet these days. Finishes off with bit of an oaky flavor.
M- Exceptionally smooth with a chewy mouthfeel. Heavy bodied with little carbonation. 
D- Surprisingly good. Since it's not overly sweet I could have easily knocked off the bomber by myself but I had some friends to share it with. A great sipper.
Overall, there was no real booziness to the beer, which isn't incredibly surprising since it's been cellared for 2 years. I'll soon have a fresh '09 Abyss to compare this one too. 
Toby, you are truly the man for hooking me up with this brew! 1,080 characterskbeals, Dec 24, 2009
4.28/5  rDev -4.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Served in a cognac snifter at 360 Pizza in Vancouver, Wa
Appearence: Head looks dark, very dark. A deep, pleasing tan color. Head pours thick and rich, it dissipates quickly however. I've had this beer a number of times and this is usually not the case. Perhaps its because I'm getting it off the tap, the vintage or something to do with the glassware? A thin film remains on the edges of the glass when swirled. The body of this beer is completely black. No light penetrates the liquid at any point on the this stout. As black as the Abyss.
Smell: Heavy notes of bourbon and dark roasted malts. Dried chocolate and slight licorice notes make their appearance occasionally. Also a whiff of dark fruits perhaps? Perhaps dark cherries or plums?
Taste: A very "dry" tasting beer. In place of bourbon there are heavy flavors of dark licorice. A slight bitter timbre is discovered through the middle of the beer. This is a sipping drink, do not attempt to quaff this or you will be very displeased with the results. Many roasty, toasty, oaky flavors are present throughout the Abyss. Allow this beer to warm up. The bitterness of the beer is more up front when served cold and many of the deeper flavors are covered up. This drink has amazing depth and complexity. Wish I could give this a 4.25.
Mouthfeel: Full bodied, almost to the point feeling physically heavy. The beer starts nice and full in the front, becomes creamy in the middle and then dries out on the back of the pallet. Again, a lot going on here.
Drinkability: A difficult value to quantify, I rate the drinkabliity of this beer highly. That being said it is dark, complex and unyielding. This RIS should be sipped over an extended period of time. Guzzling this beer results in a number of mish-mashed, unpleasent sensations. Respect the Abyss.
One of my favorite beers of all time. I wait all year for its release. The 2009 seems a little harsh compared to my recollection of the 2008 vintage. I plan on aging a few of these '09s. I have the feeling this beer will benefit greatly from the extra time. I have a few '08s here in Washington and can't wait to see what a year adds the beer. 2,155 charactersiD9, Dec 23, 2009

4.15/5  rDev -7.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Aroma is thick and oaky with a dark chocolate heft over a tang of rich molasses, cherry, fig, and the ever present oaky bourbon scent that helps add a bit a of wondefully fulfilling, nose whirling, heat. Trace of burnt coffee ensues with a nice addition to the profile.
Taste is immaculately woven with dark chocolate and a smoothly thick, lush body tranfused with all sorts of vanilla, molasses, coffee, and bourbon oakyness. A very well balanced and heavy treat. The chocolate is tenderly bittered with the heat and quite dark in its efforts. Anything and everything dark from the cocoa bean has been placed in every inch of its flavor. Spiced with a touch of peppery hops, coffee, and a terrific, if not down right perfect notion of bourbon hints wavered all throughout the chocolatey body. 794 charactersAnthony1, Dec 22, 2009

A: Moderate pour yields a 2 finger light milk chocolate, relatively fine head with moderate retention. Brew itself is just what is expected: opaque, motor oil black. Lacing is second to none. Weblike, ample, and with excellent cling. 
S: Roasted nutes, licquorice, smokiness, milk chocolate maltiness, and a background of an uncertain type of sweetness. 
T: Burnt dark fruit, slight roasted coffee beans, licquorice, and alcohol on the finish. Milk chocolate sweetness is present but subdued throughout. Finish also comes with a slight roasted sourness and a bit of hop bitterness. 
M: Medium to full bodied. Oily, smooth, slightly silky, but still rather nice going down. Finish is wet and messy. It lingers a bit with a slight sourness that pulls down this grade.
D: Very very good but sampled amidst another outstanding brew, this was not as good. Incredibly complex and I definitely appreciate it. Worthy of the hype and glad to have had the opportunity to try it. 1,134 charactersSpeedwayJim, Dec 20, 2009
4.7/5  rDev +4.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5I was very exited to try this brew per the many good reviews. I was not disappointed.
My tasting was out of a pint glass with the beer at roughly 45 degrees. 2009 vintage 
I was surprised by the pour as it was not as thick as expected. Nice 1 inch head the color of a nice mocha. Very tight almost nitro like bubbles which left a medium lacing. The color was pitch black without the slightest hint of light shining through. 
I smell coffee, oak, bourbon, vanilla and the slightest licorice essence.
It tastes of coffee, molasses, oak, bourbon, anise and vanilla. The flavor can olnly be described as deep. 
The mouthfeel like the pour is lighter then expected. Slick & enjoyably coating without any residual residue. 
This is a deep complex beer, very VERY enjoyable but not a beer that I would be able to drink all night. I think that with a couple of years of aging it would enter the epic abyss. 
I would like to mention that being a fresh vintage the oak was VERY promonant. Not necessarily a bad thing but 1,017 charactersHrolhp, Dec 20, 2009

Opened this as an early birthday present to myself. Poured a wonderful pitch black into my goblet followed by a dense cocoa creme head. Smelled of chocolate, small hints of black licorice, smoke, charcoal, caramel, vanilla, and hints of oaky bourbon. Taste was exceptional. Warm and thick on the tongue, lots of chocolate like the nose, smooth vanilla and roasted characters throughout. Some dark fruit flavors as well, could be the licorice. Mouthfeel was near perfect, I wished for just a touch more. For a beer of this strength it was ridiculously smooth although it could be the 2 years of age. I doubt I could put down a bottle by myself. Wonderful experience. 676 charactersFweezle, Dec 14, 2009

Poured this into a large tulip glass. The appearance is that of an eclipse when held up to light. This black body is then topped with a frothy espresso like head that leaves beautiful lacing on the glass. The head is not super thick after stabilizing, but is steady and never leaves. Looks beautiful.
Dark roasted malts, anise and booze rise up from the glass. Molasses is also apparent after awhile and mixes with some faint vanilla notes.
One sip of this and my mouth feels coated with slick, roasted, malty oak. The bourbon is more apparent in the taste than on the nose, but doesn't really grab center stage like it does in some bourbon barrel aged stouts. Instead, it shares the flavor profile with the oak itself. A little bit of vanilla also comes through from the oak, but is overshadowed by the molasses and licorice. The licorice comes out pretty well and is easy to detect, whereas the molasses adds to the overall flavor, but doesn't really jump out at you too much. The last flavor that mixes in is a faint bit of charred wood. Not too much, but does add some bitterness.
The mouthfeel is exceptional. One of the best I have ever had. Thick, creamy, smooth and slick. This is the body and mouthfeel that an imperial stout should have. Some warming alcohol as well, which is great for a cold winter night.
Drinkability is quite good. That being said, I am a fan of imperial stouts and RIS's, so my hand is constantly reaching back to the glass. One bomber of this is enough for the night, but I'm enjoying it all the way through.
Overall, this is an excellent imperial stout. Body, flavor and appearance are all there. I felt like the aroma could have been a little more complex, but I'm not really complaining. This is my first Abyss and I'm excited to say that I have a few more of these in the cellar to age, along with an '06 and an '07. I'm guessing a few years on this stout could make it exceptionally smooth. 1,947 characterssisuspeed, Dec 14, 2009
4.46/5  rDev -0.4%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5'09 vintage, poured into a snifter to reveal thick crema head and dark body. Beautiful lacing. Smells like earthy roasty cream with sweet alcoholic notes. What's there smells very nice, but I expected more overall aroma.
Tastes over the top! Seriously roasty and sweet followed by an intense bitter punch of hope. Very good... but so bitter! There's an earthy undertone to the whole deal with notes of vanilla, burnt caramel and some stewed pitted fruit and every flavor in it is awesome, except maybe needing to mellow out a bit. Mouthfeel is perfect: creamy carbonation with a smooth, heavy body. It would be more drinkable if it were less in your face, but as is it's very drinkable to me. Also very warming!
I like this a lot. I'm glad I've got more to age. 763 charactersabuliarose, Dec 14, 2009
4.45/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5I've had this on tap and out of the bottle now, just really wanted to hone this in before reviewing it. Sometimes, the greatest beers need to be had a few times to make sure hype / expectations aren't skewing the palate at all, and such was the case with Abyss.
09 Vintage, 07 and 08 in the cellar, so this review may be changed later.
Appearance: Very dark amber brown black, and looks like a murky swamp with some dirty edges. Laces nicely as well, but a little low out of the bottle. 
Smell: Molasses-y sweetness, caramel, a little rum-raisin, slight brown sugar, prune, chocolate, anise, and vanilla-oaky character. Booze is mildly present, but limited to more of an attribute than a dominant character.
Taste: Molasses and chocolate up-front with a coffee-like roast and a bit of spiciness from some still-fresh hops. A little sweet yet, and a little alcoholic warmth in the finish, but altogether very, very pleasant. The tap was much more molasses driven in character but less sweet than out of the bottle; I bet a year to three would do absolute wonders.
Mouthfeel: Only real hiccup for me here, as it was carbonated appropriately but not as thick as I'd hoped for out of an 11% beer. Don't get me wrong, it's still excellent, but with this sweetness I hoped for a bit thicker and creamier texture than what was given.
Drinkability: Drinks under the ABV and is smooth, tasty, and full of complexity and flavor. On tap may have been a little too carbonated, but the flavors were more intense. Definitely a great big stout, and love the increased bottle numbers this year allowing me to pick up almost a case to age, as I have a feeling this is only going to get better as the residual sugars ferment out and add a whole 'nother dimension to this already very tasty brew. 1,783 charactersnomomentwasted, Dec 14, 2009

On tap at the Toronado release event and from the bottle poured into 16 oz wine glass. 
A - Jet black as expected. The foam is surprisingly dark. Inch of head that thins to about 1/4 inch. Amazing lacing. 
S - Alcohol, coffee, molasses, oak and bourbon. In that order 
T - Fantastic. Chocolate nay cocoa. Coffee and molasses (not surprisingly). The way the tastes are layered make the beer. While not quite as complex or layered as the FWXIII. Coffee, caramel, chocolate with a hint of oak.

Thanks to JDV for the bottles he sent long, long ago. Much appreciated.
The Abyss is a very dark chocolate fudge color. It looks onyx and is opaque. There's not a hint of light getting through anywhere. It's topped with a dark mocha brown head that stands about two fingers tall. It's somewhat quick to recede, leaving sticky chunks of lace clinging to the glass. I suspect the abv may be just a little too high for it to stick around long.
The nose is very impressive. Chocolate malts are abundant. They have a sweet, chocolate fudge character. There's a healthy amount of molasses and a bit of a smoky scent. Black licorice is here to a small extent, but it's a very subtle, secondary component. The oak barrel aging imparts a very nice oak scent that adds a ton of character to the nose. I'm not appreciating any bourbon despite the label's indication that some portion was aged in oak bourbon barrels. There are some leafy and floral notes that I suspect are remnants of hops. Alcohol is mildly noticeable, but it doesn't smell strong. That's impressive. This is great smelling beer. It might even be a little better with some bourbon coming through.
The flavor profile is nothing short of amazing. It has an impeccable chocolate malt base. It's full of sweet chocolate fudge flavor. It does taste slightly smoky, but it's a subtle flavor. There's definitely a hoppy flavor that I'm amazed is still here after two years. I'm sure it's been tamed by time, but it still provides a bitter edge that is damn impressive. The oak barrel aging really gives it a wonderful oak or wood-chip flavor. It indeed adds a ton of character and complements the stout flavors perfectly. I'm still not getting much, if any, bourbon, but it's not sorely missed. It might add a little something. Definitely not much though. Molasses and black licorice are secondary, but play a nice role and add more complexity to the overall flavor. Alcohol never seems to be much of a factor. It's a little noticeable, but is never warm or strong. Wow. I'm really at a loss for describing how good this beer really is. It's stunning.
The Abyss has a full body that's smooth and creamy. It feels a little light initially, but becomes more substantial with warming. It's not quite viscous enough to be perfect, but it's damn good. Drinkability is extremely high for such a big beer. Yeah, it's a little strong, but it never feels like it. It goes down so smooth and easy. This bomber simply doesn't seem like enough. I want more.
The Abyss is a certainly a special beer that deserves every single accolade that comes its way. One sip is all it takes to realize that. I recall having a fresh(er) bottle of this 2007 Reserve some time ago. No doubt it was damn good. But, I believe two years have really refined it. It is better today than I recall. I have no hesitation saying today that this is easily one of the top three beers I've experienced. It's simply that good. Find a bottle and stow it away for a couple of years. You won't be disappointed. If you happen to have a bottle of 2007 Reserve, it's drinking mighty fine right now. Perhaps you should open it. 3,150 charactersprototypic, Dec 13, 2009

After removing the wax top seal, I poured it into a sniffer glass. Black as night and semi-thick. Immediately a deep tannish brown head rises...very frothy and creamy. Laces beautifully BTW. The aroma is good, but not as strong as I imagined. Very chocolaty, coffee, and that's about it! 
Wow, what a wonderful flavor, not let down at all! Chocolate, coffee, bitter backside stout's usually leave, creamy, thick...excellent! Enjoyed this stout and want another one! 542 charactersShadesOfGray, Dec 11, 2009

Pours a black that I have never quite seen in another beer before. Dark as...an abyss. 
Smells of roasted coffee, dark chocolate, and faint trace of licorice. Not an overpowering aroma but very inviting. 
Rich roasted chocolate malt up front with noticable bourbon and licorice flavors. Definitely a warm beer that stands to age wonderfully. Luckilly I have another one of these to do just that. 
Rich creamy and full bodied mouthfeel. Great amount of carb that enhanced the mouthfeel wonderfully. 
despite the richness and heat, this goes down really nicely. This is a beer to sip and cherish. 
When you try a highly touted beer such as this I'm always fearful of the overhype. But this is truly an outstanding beer. Worthy of the rating and then some. 773 charactersbjacobsen, Dec 10, 2009
4.61/5  rDev +2.9%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.52009 vintage, on-tap at the Library Ale House in Santa Monica. Served in a Unibroue tulip glass. 
Opaque, seal brown liquid with a dense dark tan, gold flecked head of creamy, uniform foam with superior retention. Pinkish-brown curtains of lacing paint the glass. Sticky legs surround the lacing, suspending it like a specimen under a slide.
Brown bread, roast malt, brown sugar, and dried fruit aromatics. Faint hops? Restrained overall.
The flavor has balance beyond belief. The sum total is very intense, but the components are subtle: dark fruit, roast malt, caramel, estery alcohol notes, espresso, chocolate, coconut, vanilla, and black pepper. Long, bittersweet finish with that lingering signature Deschutes roast malt note. Fantastic.
Full bodied, thick, chewy, and a bit sticky with mild astringency to offset the sweetness. Warming, but the ABV is fully integrated into the flavor profile. 
A bit hard to describe...even harder to put down. 956 charactersaugustgarage, Dec 10, 2009
4.87/5  rDev +8.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5A - Pours very dark and black with no light escaping out of this beer!! A lovely dark brown head forms and remains for a short time leaving behind some terrific lacing. It's very viscous and thick, almost gloopy at times during the pour. 
S - Smells of rich milk chocolate, sweet caramel, toffee, molasses, a hint of black licorice and anise coming through as well. Underneath all of that is definitely a layer of vanilla. The main thing is that I swear I'm smelling a giant rich chocolate milkshake!! There is a hint of alcohol coming through as well. I could sit and smell this beer all night long!! The aromas are so clean and pronounced...incredible aromas coming through!! 
T - The flavor is very full and complex delivering notes of a nice charred woody complexity but the sweet molasses, the dark licorice, anise, and bitter coffee are extremely delicious! There are also soft and supple flavors of browned sugar, toffee, and of course, that lucious rich sweet chocolate coming through beautifully! 
M - The body is full and heavy as a stout should be. The beer finishes with the sweet chocolate malts delivering to the very end. 
D - This is one big and exciting beer! "Excellent" in every sense of the word!! 1,221 charactersEldalonde, Dec 09, 2009

A slightly vigorous pour, shows a lively beer with a this coffee brown head. settles to a thin cap. It pours very thick and very black. It looks amazing, I am so excited to drink this brew! I take a big whiff and a sweet clean roastiness, also hints of raisin and vanilla, and I get that anise. There is also a bit of oak in there. The taste is wonderful, nice clean roastiness, dark chocolate mixed with raisins. I had to look for the oak and bourbon, but it was there. And anise in the finish. The finish is clean, and you just can't wait to take another sip. What a wonderful beer, so much going on. The carbonation was perfect for this beer and the mouthfeel was silky smooth. Overall a great beer and I can't wait to drink more of this in the future! 786 characterswalows, Dec 07, 2009
4.78/5  rDev +6.7%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5*2009 vintage- poured into my Delirium Tremens Tulip 
Pours a DEEP black- with lovely head that gets me all giddy. 
Smell is awesome- just incredible, good notes of bourbon, molasses, Chocolate bits with some pangs of toffee.
First sip is just a wow moment- tastes of bourbon, coffee and chocolate blend to make for an incredibly tasty beer. That said- after the first few sips the hot/boozy goblin rears it's ugly head and sadly overpowers this beer. However- remember this is a 2009 vintage that they recommend you to age for another year- hell it says to open it on 11/10/10 on the bottle!
Drinkability- not now- but after a year it will be so smooth and blissful. Still the first few sips gave a great mouthfeel and felt thick.
This is an amazing beer which I think In my opinion is going to get better with age- I have 07, 08 and 09 bottles aging now and will update once I try one of the older vintages. 914 characterskunstdrache, Dec 07, 2009

S: Mellow bourbon, bitter chocolate, molasses, toffee, roasted malt.
T: Splendid, smooth BA stout. Bourbon and sweetness are subtle, and everything is balanced to perfection. The licorice adds a very interesting component to the overall flavor.

A - Pours - no, slowly creeps - out of the bottle a solid, black black. NO amount of light even begins to escape through the edges of this black hole. Thick 2 finger dark coffee head that recedes oh so slowly. 
S - Insane, just insane. There's so much going on here I'll do my best to describe it but I don't see how I can do it justice. Lots of sweet malt, Chocolate, Dark fruits, mocha, brown sugga, and molasses with strong alcohol notes dominate. No surprise on the alcohol, I imagine it'll quiet down with age. 
T - Smokey, oaky, bourbon-ey sweet dark malts, with burnt coffee and molasses, dark cocoa nibs, some dark fruits (cherries?) and alcohol. A bit hot at this point, but I attribute that more to my impatience than any real flaw - these things aren't meant to be consumed fresh. Warms nicely
M - Very thick and chewy, lots of caloric energy in this bad boy. Coats the tongue fully. 
D - My favorite RIS so far...but of course! Lives up to the hype, which is really saying something given all the hype baggage it carries. 1,090 charactersNYCWheatFanSC, Dec 07, 2009

S- Chocolate, caramel and coffee dominate the nose. Quite an awesome smell. Little bit of dark fruityness in there but mostly just pungent roastyness and coffee.
T- Mmmm. So good. Roasty and coffee flavors are still prevalent as in the nose. A bitter aftertaste hits in the end which is nice. Not much boozyness going on here and alcohol is very well hidden.
M- Very smooth during all aspects of the sipping. The carbonation is just right. There is a very small amount of alcohol burn but nothing to dock anything for, it is very warming at the same time so it makes up for it with that.

 A.
Pours black with a deep brown head that is thick and creamy. Awsome coating of the glass that propels this rating to a 5.
S. The smell is awsome to say the least. Creamy chocolate, alcohol , many various "dark" fruits, and dark toasted toast.
Many other "smells" come through with each whiff. Sweet malts dominate with various spiciness. 
T. Burnt malts that consist of sweet dark chocolate flavors. A LONG LONG bitter/sweet aftertaste. Strong aloholic bourbon -like flavors. Mexican vanillas and wood flavors are everywhere with this 33% barrel aged brew. 
Creamy and bitter are the waring factors. Bitter wins, but creamy comes in a close second. Sweet molassis right behind in third place. WWWAAAhooo! 
M. THICK!!!!
D. A sipper. WIll age a few to see if the bitterness tames some. 
Awsome. A sipper, a memorable brew. Will age two of these for at least a year to see what happens.

A: A black and viscous body that supported an immense dark mocha colored head and cobweb-like lacing. Couldn't imagine a better looking RIS than this stuff! The appearance invites the palate in way that few beers do. 
S: Bourbon, molasses, dark fruit, vanilla, chocolate and wood are the main components of the smell. Perhaps some caramel and red fruit (cherry) qualities to the aroma as well, but in very minute amounts. The only knock on the beer is the evident soy sauce smell given off as the beer warms up/flattens. 
T: A mix of cocoa-powder and dark chocolate, oak, bourbon, and black licorice sweetness. An added vanilla characteristic comes out towards middle palate, complementing the robust oak taste. The flavor does a great job of balancing both the sweet and roasty malts. 
M: Super creamy (which makes it beyond a full-body beer), mild carbonation, and a chocolate chalky feel after a few moments. I've noticed fresher vintages of Abyss tend to have a thinner body, but seem to gain more and more as time goes on. 
D: I don't know what else to say other than "WOW!" The flavor profile is exceptional and the alcohol is hidden extremely well. Really couldn't ask more out of a big beer like this. 
Overall: A beer to cherish and savor; a must try on tap or out of a bottle. Cheers! 1,456 charactersOlieIPA, Dec 06, 2009
3.86/5  rDev -13.8%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 3.5Finally got my hands on this one. Fresh 2009 bottling. 
First half of the bottle in a darkness tulip, second half in a Duvel tulip. Just to mix it up. 
Appearance is great. Cool bottle, understated label. (as an aside, I really like Deschutes design theme for the reserve series.) Pour is exactly what you'd expect if you were designing a "dream stout." Perfect one finger mocha head. Good carbonation. 
On to the smell. Bitter coffee, baker's chocolate, smoke, some molasses. Where's that bourbon? Pretty typical RIS on the nose to be honest, nothing that special. 
Taste goes with that "pretty typical, nothing special" vibe. Coffee, smoke, some licorice/molasses, bitter chocolate, alcohol (strong alcohol). 
Very bitter, especially on the aftertaste. And Bourbon....where art thou? Maybe some oak, but that's all I'm getting from the barrels. 
Mouthfeel is perfect. Nothing more to say there. Drinkability limited by the bitter heat. 
Well....Expectations probably too high. An above average stout, very good example of the style, but nothing to jump through hoops for. 
Have a couple for the cellar, and this one needs some time it seems. Still, expected more from a fresh bottle.
----
Fresh 2010 bottle. Better than fresh 2009. Smoother. But needs more than 33% in the barrel to be top notch. Still too typical in the flavor department. Roasted malts with licorice and molasses, and little else. 
Why is this rated so high? 1,436 characterscaskstrength, Dec 05, 2009

Appearance - Black. Netherworldy. The absence of light. Two inches of mocha head dissipate leaving a nice ring and great lacing. It's a pretty looking beer. 
Smell - Unsweetened chocolate. Burnt sugar. Maybe some toasted marshmallow. Definitely some oak and some smoke. Dark fruits, raisin, prune almost. Could practically smell it across the room when the bottle opened. Very nice.
Taste - Pretty bitter coffee. Some sweetness follows, the molasses comes through some. Lots of burnt coffee/chocolate on the finish. A hint of vanilla. Maybe some bourbon, but mostly just the booze. It's VERY hot right now.
Mouthfeel - A little on the thin side, but good carbonation so it's not a mess. 
Drinkability - It's pretty damn hot. Very boozy, and with a tough bitter finish.
Huh. While RIS is not my favorite style, I've had many of the best (BT, Ten Fidy, Speedway, BCS, Stone IRS, Peche Mortel) and this one just isn't as good to me as many of those. Reminds me most of the Stone, which is really not my favorite. I'm honestly surprised it's this well regarded. However, I think it will improve with age and hopefully mellow out. Certainly a nice beer, but nothing I'm very excited about. I'd much prefer to crack one of the Ten Fidy's chilling in my fridge right now.
Honestly, if anything I'm being generous. This is such a highly regarded beer I have trouble understanding what I'm missing. If it weren't for the sterling reputation I might have been harsher.
UPDATE: Had a 2010 recently that I'd been aging. It held up nicely, five years later. Still not my favorite, but if you like it, you'll really like it with some age on it. 1,840 characterscallmescraps, Dec 05, 2009

This stuff is exactly what an imperial stout should be. Beachwood BBQ's abyss night presented 07 08 09 and 10 abyss... I recently had 2011 abyss and yes, that's phenomenal too. 
I could go on and on about its boozy rich chocolateyness and lovely smell but every and their mother has already. I just need to do right by the universe and acknowledge this juggernauts prowess, dissolving my earlier review of what we all know now has been just an off year in a spectacular pedigree. 583 charactersgregmoscetti, Dec 03, 2009
4.66/5  rDev +4%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Holy Crap.
It was my first reaction to this beer. Honestly, I think it's probably the most appropriate.
Poured into a 10 oz chalice, 2009 vintage.
It is truly the Abyss. The only light to get through is at the very edges of the glass where it still is a dense brown fading into intense black. 
Nose is the, yet mellow. A bit nutty, and roasty, but not an overwhelming amount of nose.
The many fine layers of different chocolates and coffees blend with a mellow dark fruit character that is only really implied in the very center of the pallette and then fades back into the roastiness that is everpresent. 
Dense and delightful, this beer is at once rich and light. Like a perfectly done flourless chocolate cake spiked generoussly with amaretto and espresso. And somehow, the entire 10 oz. pour went down fairly quickly.
Again, I must stress.
Holy Crap. 862 charactersLibraryTom, Dec 02, 2009

The rich taste melts in your mouth like a good chocolate bar with a hint of coffee. 
This beer can be enjoyed with any meal or just for pure beer drinking enjoyment. I like it in a frozen glass. 321 charactersitsopy, Nov 30, 2009
5/5  rDev +11.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Had this the other day on Tap at the Grad in Davis: 2009
A - Pitch Black, with a nice tan head. The carbonation is perfect and allows for head to develope with a simple swirl. The lacing head is beutiful and shows every sip.
S - Sweet Chocolate bourbon goodness. The first scent is rather sweet like opening a fresh chocolate bar. Following that is a bourbon vanilla bite, followed by a slight bitterness in the final wiff.
T - like haeaven. The aroma, mouthfeel, and flavor combine to make this the ultimate drinking expirience. The first taste is sweet like freshly roasted cocoa, and then a roasty coffee like flavor follows. The sweetness in the vanilla like esters from the bourbon add to that, and finally, a slight bitter finish. This is no beer, this is an expirience.
M - This beer is perfectly carbed. The mouthfeel is full, creamy, and smooth. It hits your mouth, and feels as if it is expanding to hit every single flavor receptor in your mouth for a taste orgazm. The sticky finish leaves an aftertaste that is sweet, roasty, and delicous.
D - This beer, being 11% gets one last A+ in this category. I was able to down 3 pints of this bad boy that night. It just keeps calling you back for more. After one, you just don't want the Abyss expirience to end. Not filling, no nasty tasting offputs, combined with a flavor and aftertaste that makes you want to keep drinking it gives this beer a perfect 5.
This beer is my favorite Imperial Stout for a reason. It is something everybody should expirience. 1,519 charactersabecall98, Nov 30, 2009

A very careful pour lead to a huge head that fell slowly and laced judiciously. A nice layer of foam sits atop the liquid with a mousse like consistency. Color is deep dark black. Smells wonderful, candy, sugar, hops, roasted coffee, lots to smell. Taste is initially bitter and green, then flows back to a smooth creamy chocolate with bitter roasty notes at the back of the palate. Mouthfeel and drinkability are good as well. I'm taking this in pretty slow because it does taste big. No real hints of alcohol either. 600 charactersmerryjoulton, Nov 30, 2009

A - A careful pour left less of a head than I was expecting. Lacing climbing all the way up to the rim of the 25cl glass. Dark brown and black.
S - Coffee, dark chocolate, rich sugars.
T - Tastes of roasted everything, with a roasty bitterness framing all the other flavors and leaving a dominant bitter aftertaste. The bitterness, in fact, may at times dissuade me from this beer.
M - Incredibly creamy and smooth.
D - I'm not one to hold a high alcohol level against a beer; does one fault the birds for singing? Because then lighter beers would necessarily be rated higher in drinkability just because they're lighter, which misses much about the actual experience of drinking a beer. This is an eminently drinkable beer, even if the Abyss is indeed dark and dank.
One of the true greats, a masterpiece. 832 charactersRizow, Nov 29, 2009
4.9/5  rDev +9.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5The last epic beer of the BA birthday bash. Shared with BeerFMAndy for our birthdays.
Poured into two imperial pint glasses the beer is black as coal with full three inches of creamy mocha head. This is the first beer I've witnessed to cascade like rain without the benefit of a nitro boost. This beer looks like what all RIS should look like. After a long wait the head settles enough for a thick coating of melted ice cream like lace to form around the edges. 
The aroma is mind blowing. Super rich fudge cake,black coffee,roast malt, anise, molasses,camp fire and hints of bitter hops. It has a wonderful summertime grilled smokiness that takes me back to my childhood. Watching dad cook on the grill. This beer is an olfactory celebration.
The flavor is monsterous. It follows the nose very close. Bitter hops greet your tongue right out of the gate. Something I think will fade with age rather nicely. After the hop bite things go up fro there. Black coffee, chocolate ganash, burnt malt, dark toasted bread, anise, molasses, and a hint of dark fruit. The amalgamate of flavors seems to set up shop on your tongue and last forever after you finish your sip. So rich and complex. I now know what A RIS should taste like.
Full chewy and robust body. Like liquid fudge coffee cake.
Overall the top RIS I've ever had. The booze can come on strong after warming but I'm sure that will be taken care of with some age. I can't wait for a year to pass so I can crack open another bottle. 1,489 charactersbeerwolf77, Nov 29, 2009
4.7/5  rDev +4.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 3.522 oz wax-capped bomber bottle shared and poured into a Sierra Nevada Imperial Pint. 2009 Vintage, 11% ABV, Best After 11/1/2010 (I definitely wanted to try it fresh for a comparison).
Massive thanks to Beerwolf77 for sharing this for our shared birthday tastings!
A - A good, tall pour releases a massive four-and-a-half finger head that cascaded amazingly! Great retention to the dark tan head and huge lacing left all over the glass. The beer poured with a little bit of opacity showing its clarity and deep, dark brown color. In the glass however it's a different story. No highlights, no light shines through. The Abyss is a black hole.
S - Tons of oak on the nose with a great earthy, wood-filled nose. The molasses is delicious-smelling in the background and a bit of the black licorice is in there giving it a crazy flavor to it. Tons of roasted malt lingers everywhere with trailing scents of black coffee and unsweetened chocolate. A bit of the bourbon barrel booze comes out too but not a whole lot considering it's percent.
T - Lots of roasted malts that blacken out your tongue like a thick ink. A ton of coffee that lingers through the long finish gives it a dry bitterness. The molasses is more robust in the flavor and the licorice stays at that hint-level; not too present. A lot of the oak woodiness with nutty flavors comes through too. The oak bourbon barrel flavor with the alcohol is mild for how strong the beer is. Its a brooding, complex beer with abounding flavor but it definitely would be better with age.
M - Completely full-bodied and robust with a bold flavor and a smooth, creamy feel. Soft and delicious, the finish becomes very dry and bitter from the high level of roasted malts. It's got a cold black coffee finish.
D - Lots of oak bourbon barrel and alcohol flavors that slowly become cloying really lower the drinkability to me. It's an absolutely fantastic beer but it's undoubtedly something to have infrequently and with age as it suggests. I'm very happy I was able to try it as fresh as I did so I have grounds to compare aged Abyss.
Thanks a million to Todd for sharing this black hole of a beer with me! 2,155 charactersBeerFMAndy, Nov 29, 2009

Smells of espresso, molasses, chocolate, with some bourbon like notes.
Tastes of the big roasted malt upfront characterized by bitter coffee and dark chocolate followed by an oak note. Plenty going on here. There is also the molasses sweetness that comes out. Some alcohol warmth comes through as well to make this a bit more of a sipper.
The mouthfeel is full and creamy, but not quite syrupy or chewy. 486 charactersocelot2500, Nov 29, 2009
4.03/5  rDev -10%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Thanks to bosnreeb85 for this 09 bottle.
Pours a muddy brown with a fantastic brown head of tight fluff. Leave some lacing on the glass.
Chocolate, coffee, some oak, hint of bourbon and bit of vanilla and bourbon.
Lots of coffee up front which adds some bitterness. Not as complex as I was hoping for. Needs some time to reach its peak. Not as oaky and bourbony as I would have thought. Some hints of vanilla bean as well.
Carbonation is a bit harsh. Full bodied, but not as rich and thick as other top RIS's. Dry finishing.
Alcohol is well hidden, which makes this pretty easy to drink. Not overly rich and thick, but this really needs to age to reach its full potential. Wanted to try it fresh, but it's now apparent that it will be remarkably better with a year or more on it. 784 charactersjera1350, Nov 28, 2009

This shit is Wesley Snipes-black. It is Charlie Murphy-black. There is nearly two fingers of tan head, which is fairly substantial for an imperial stout. The lacing is tight, and reminiscent of the black swirls in the symbiotic uniform of Carnage (Marvel Comics). Awesome.
Holy balls, this smells like a heath bar. With coffee put on it. There are loads of dark chocolate and delicious toffee aromas. This isn't, ostensibly, a coffee stout but there certainly is a heavy coffee element to this beer. There is a fruit character to the beer that tastes like a blend of black currant and yuzu, but this isn't by any means an overly fruity stout.
This beer tastes awesome. The nose carries over onto the tongue. Its so fruity if you hold it on the tip of your tongue. On the back end of the palate? Lots of roasted malt. The roast character is really special; its flavorful and bitter but simultaneously smooth as Hell. I have to note that the alcohol is noticeable. You don't taste it so much as you sense it; the fusels aren't tasted but rather expelled through your nose when you breath out. The aftertaste is exquisite -- the hops really work themselves into a drying, herbal, minty thing. The roast character sticks out amongst those hops and eventually it all melds into an ice cream/pudding like flavor until you refresh your palate with another sip.
The mouthfeel is pleasantly thick. It isn't so viscous as to completely coat the sides and roof of your mouth, but its going to be pretty chewy. Drinkability is nice if only because this beer is both full flavored (in every sense of the word) and smooth. The slight alcohol harshness prevents this from being scored even higher.
Nietzche had it right: stare long into the abyss and the abyss stares back at you. This beer will haunt you like Slenderman on your Marble Hornets video footage. I can't wait until I try this vintage a year from now. 1,950 charactersReaper16, Nov 28, 2009

- Nice not-so-dark black... could somewhat see a little through the edges... nice and brown. Somewhat thick light mocha colored head, down to a solid 1/8" constant layer on top. This puppy is alive and well, and was wanting to sit for a couple years.
- Nice sweet oats, vanilla, brown sugars.... wet grain... light bourbon, and oak.
- Smooth sailing even fresh, if not just a little too bitter.... great vanilla oak flavors with some fantastic grains and oats in taste. Overall pretty tasty... but not quite as good as I think it will be in the future.
- Somewhat thick but bubbly all the same... so not too bad... more med. bodied.... slightly dry, and chalky.
- Overall still a fantastic and unique stout.... and I know it will be better years down the road. 814 charactersDocer, Nov 27, 2009
4.35/5  rDev -2.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 42008 vintage provided to by JohnGalt1. A great beer from a great trader! 
Appearance- Pours a usual shade of opaque black but with a nice finger and a half of brown head that builds up off of the body of the beer. Large and bubbly head with a fair amount of lacing left as I drink.
Smell- Lots going on here. Roasted malts, caramel, chocolate, burnt coffee, licorice, brown sugar, and just a touch of wood are the primary smells that I can detect. However, there is a lot happening and I doubt that I got it all.
Taste- Here, lots of rich brown sugar, a healthy dose of roastiness, some burnt coffee, bitter chocolate, licorice, and a touch of astringent alcohol. Unfortunately for me, I am very sensitive to licorice flavors after somehow managing to chew on the branch of an anise plant as a child on a trip to Greece and nearly threw up afterwards as a result of the strength of the flavor. While that experience heightened the licorice flavors for me, I doubt they would be so overwhelming to the normal drinker. A complex RIS and very tasty.
Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Substantial mouthfeel, though I actually found the astringent alcohol to make the carbonation feel a touch aggressive. However, it is complex and surprisingly drinkable for an imperial stout.
Overall, a world class beverage and fairly widely available to boot. Get your hands on one, and Sproser, we'll have to share another vintage sometime under less clandestine circumstances! 1,455 charactersboatshoes, Nov 27, 2009
4.8/5  rDev +7.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5On tap at Papago in Scotsdale. Wow did we luck out to get to try this on tap. I've had a bottle of the 2008 before, and I have a vertical in my cellar, but being from Cleveland it's so hard to open one of these without feeling the occasion does not warrant it. So, we were super psyched to get a nice snifter of this beauty from the tap.
Appearance is wonderful. Pitch black. Nice small ring of brown-ish foam lets us know it's alive ;)
Smell is great. Chocolatey malt, a hint of wood, and a great deep roast are wafted towards me.
Taste is absolutely incomparable. This is the smoothest and most pristine example of a complex wood-aged American Imperial Stout I've ever had. Starts off with a nice roast kick, then smooths out into vanilla and wood. I love the way the chocolatey taste and wood mingle with the roasted flavor. A hint of licorice makes this absolutely one of the most cohesive complex flavor profiles I've ever enjoyed. Could not be any better!
Mouth is spot-on. Not too creamy, but perfect carb and a nice visco.
Drinkability is fantastic. I helped my fiancee finish hers and could have had another couple. It was just that good.
I love this beer. No worries about falling into the abyss, take the plunge, it'll hold you in darkness just long enough to appreciate the light. A world class offering and something I will be ISO each year. 1,360 charactersjampics2, Nov 26, 2009

Pours a deep black with a nice tan head that recedes nicely into a halo. slight patchy lacing left on the edges. 
The aroma is of roasted coffee, some toffee, bitter chocolate, some vanilla, and a light alcohol burn.
The taste is smoother than I imagined. It nice and roasty up front. It then recedes into a semi sweet vanilla and then a bitter coffee and toasted malt taste. A light alcohol burn and woodiness on the finish.
Very smooth and rich. Almost a bit chewy. Low carbonation but the perfect amount.
Overall this is everything I hoped it would be. A fantastic imperial stout that lives up to the billing. 655 charactersShrLSU, Nov 26, 2009
4.38/5  rDev -2.2%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Long have I waited to try this one, as I have patiently sat on this for two years before cracking open my first 2007 vintage. You can't nail the appearance any more than this. Oil slick black color with a lively coco colored head adorning the top. Thick gobs of lace hold fast while an everpresent halo of foamy bubbles stays around for the ride. The nose is very deep with flavor. Chocolate and vanilla whaft around a bit, as does a bourbon coated hop scent. Lots of aromas at work here. Taste is good, but subtle. Very gentle vanilla kisses the tongue alond with a thin chocolate coating. The hop bitterness lends a hand to help balance things out from all the sweetness, and combines with a coffee presence. I think the age has helped knock the alcohol burn down a lot to where it's hardly even noticeable. Moutfeel is tremendously smooth, but is a little lighter than i'd like it to be. I little more chewy with a touch of stickiness would be nice. A wonderful beer to be sure, but is it the best imperial stout out there? No, I thought Dark Lord was a cut above. 1,067 charactersryrust5301, Nov 26, 2009
4.3/5  rDev -4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.52008 bottle, poured into my Bruery tulip.
Surprise, surprise! It's black! There's a very slight ring of auburn around the edge of the liquid when I hold it up to the light... but yeah, pretty much black. A tan head forms, but dissolves to nothing within a minute or two.
Smell is of dark chocolate, roasted malt, black licorice, and a hint of a sweet smell... almost like pancake syrup... perhaps that's the molasses talking. It's nice. It could be amped up a bit, IMO, but it's nice.
Taste is very good. Rich chocolate and black licorice take center stage - although, unlike some beers (I'm looking at you, Ten Fidy) the licorice is not overbearing. It's well done here. It's a sweet brew, but not very sweet as compared to other imperial stouts. The barrel aging notes are minimal here. No evidence of heat whatsoever. Very nice.
Mouthfeel is good. It's not as thick and chewy as I would like, but it's close. 
As imperial stouts go, this is very drinkable. I think the controlled sweetness goes a long way for this. 
Very nice beer from Deschutes. As far as widely-available imperial stouts go, this is king. However, that said, I do not LOVE this beer. I like it a great deal, and would never shy away from drinking it... but it doesn't grab me the way it seems to grab others here. But, in any case, this is a very, very good beer. 1,342 charactersdavod23, Nov 25, 2009

Deep black pour with huge tan foamy head. Aroma of roasted malts, coffee, bourbon and vanilla.
Flavor is of chocolate, coffee, vanilla, and roasted malts. Very creamy and thick. Not sure what the licorice does to the beer, but the ingredients all combine to make one hell of a beer. Very creamy and thick. The alcohol in this 11% ABV is very well hidden and the beer is extremely drinkable.
Going to cellar a few to see what a year or two does to this beer. 473 charactersmuttyd, Nov 25, 2009

Definitely tasted the black licorice and molasses. Charred dark malts. A little coffee. Traces of bourbon and vanilla. Aside from the licorice, I'm also getting some sort of other spice or herb. Went down fairly easy for such a big beer. Mouthfeel was actually thinner than I was expecting. 
Glad i finally got to try this, but somewhat let down. Then again, I'm not a huge fan of black licorice and I also had my hopes set pretty high, expecting one of the best beers of all time. I can still appreciate this beer though and understand why it has such a large following. 586 charactersTrappissed, Nov 22, 2009

A - Pours an opaque, pitch black with two fingers of creamy, dark tan head that slowly descends, leaving ample lacing behind. Nice retention. 
S - A menage of roasted dark malts, chocolate, coffee, molasses, dark fruit, and bourbon. Ample hop bitterness in the aroma as well. There is a touch of alcohol on the nose, but it seems to be masked rather well. Great aroma overall.
T - Similar to the nose, with an array of flavors coming through. Rich, dark roasted malts complemented with some nice coffee flavors up front. Bittersweet chocolate, molasses, dark fruit flavors, a hint of bourbon, and a touch of spiciness(perhaps the licorice?) come through in the middle. A fairly strong hop bitterness lends some dryness and balance to the finish. Slight alcohol burn, but it is really well hidden overall. Great, complex flavor.
M - Medium-full body with light carbonation. Perhaps a bit light bodied for the style, but it is velvety smooth, and rich enough without being overly filling.
D - This brew is just delicious and very well done in every aspect. Great complexities and balance, and the 11% ABV is hidden very well. A treat, indeed. 1,158 charactersGarrisWH, Nov 22, 2009
5/5  rDev +11.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This is as good as they say. I've had the '08 on tap and the '09 on tap and in the bottle.
I confess; I'm not impartial. I waited in line the day they released this at the Portland pub. I'd only tasted it twice before ('06 bottle and '08 tap), but I knew I wanted more. Releasing it on a weekday at 2pm guaranteed that only the unemployed or those who value beer more than their job would be there (sorry boss).
I've been sampling other Imperial Stouts to calibrate my taste so I can give some context. I've had Storm King, Rogue's Russian Imperial, and Obovoid in the last week. This beer stands up and surpasses them all. It doesn't have the oakiness of Obovoid or the hops of Rogue's, but it does have the complete package.
In a word: balance. There's some oak here, but it's subtle. It is, of course, hoppy, but it doesn't leave *any* harsh aftertaste like Rogue's (which I love, btw). It is a truly a Goldilocks beer. Not too thick, not too thin, not too hoppy, carbonated or oaky.
This is one of those beers that just brings a sense of calm to your entire body. If you've had a beer like this, you know what I'm talking about. 
It does get better with time. I had the '08/'09 side-by-side flight at the Portland Pub and the difference was definitely noticeable. Not pronounced, but definitely there. Have some restraint and age this a year if you get more than a bottle.
I'm not sure there's a single beer in the world I'd rather have. 1,447 charactershansendc, Nov 20, 2009

Poured into 12 ounce goblet
Pours as black as the name indicates. Two fingers of light brown head that dissipated in a few minutes leaving a sticky lace around my glass.
I absolutely love the smell of this beer...and i get different smells every time! The alcohol is masked well by the coffee, malts, dark fruits, and a tinge of coffee. There is a lot going on in this beer!
One of my all time favorites as far as taste goes...I made sure to pick up several the past few years. They mellow out to perfection over time, but even the 2009 tastes phenomenal. It's really difficult to describe as there is so much going on in this beer. there is an intial roasty sweet malty coffee flavor that gives way to a baker's chocolate. The beer finishes a couple of different times, leaving some bitter / licorice behind. I like this beer slightly chilled but always find it getting better and better the closer it gets to room temperature. The flavors just jump out at you!
The Abyss is just a little thinner than I'd expect from the style, but I love the way it coats the inside of my mouth. 
Seriously, this is one of those beers that is tough to keep in the cellar. Truly a masterpiece. Well done Deschutes! 1,423 charactershayesez, Nov 20, 2009

The flavor is more chocolate, coffee and a bit boozier. The licorice and molasse are also noted. The beer is a full bodied sipper.

Still very smooth, but does have that bite at the finish that leaves an alcohol tinge in the mouth. Wonderful beer (slightly more coffee and a kick than the other members of the "big 4")- right up there with Kate (more chocolate) and DL (more booze and a bit creamier) for me, just behind Darkness (just plain creamier and dessert like) yet I still have to do a vertical with my 08 and 07- just waiting for the right day! 717 charactersDrDogbeer, Nov 19, 2009

I really enjoyed the opportunity to drink this highly rated beer and was not disappointed. It's beautiful in the glass, as dark as it can get with a very brown head that lasted a while and laced the glass as it went. There's a big, full nose with a touch of alcohol in it. The mouthfeel was oddly light at first but more richness and complexity toward the finish. The flavor was full and well balanced with chocolate being the most noticable.

On my second glass of this brew, and it lives up to the reputation. This brew is a nearly opaque black with a foamy brown head, lacing the glass all the way down. Aroma is top notch, lots of dark chocolate, some light coffee. Very thick tasting brew, coats the tongue with a lot of bitter chocolate, cocoa and a slight hint of bourbon; not much in the licorice department but that's OK -- a little alcohol burn comes through at the end. It's a bit boozy, but nothing that alters the taste or chases you away.

OVERALL sure it's big and designed to be a sipper. But when something is as delicious as this, the sips come at short intervals. One of my all time favorites. 791 characterssprucetip, Nov 16, 2009
4.52/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5This is the 08 vintage.
A: Black as black can be. only a mild amount of mocha colored head, that did not retain very well. Only a touch of lace is present.
S: Very nice roastiness, with some coffee that is held up by a a nice wood and vanilla note. Some of the bourbon comes out as well and provides a tough more sweetness.
T: Very nice chocolate note to start. The chocolate is both sweet and bitter. The wood is noticeable and provides some vanilla and bourbon flavor. It has a bit of breadiness/ chocolate chip cookie sweetness.
M: Super creamy, smooth, and full bodied with out being overwhelmingly heavy, cloyingly sweet, or chalky. Also, there is no booziness present at all.
D: Very easy to sip on for a long period of time. The best part is how like this feels despite being such a big beer. 804 charactersmikey711, Nov 16, 2009
4.48/5  rDev 0%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Bought a bottle stating: best before 11/1/2010, but I refused to wait on this one:
A- black, no hints of other colors whatsoever. Dark brown head that left lacing at every sip.
S- coffee notes, with some of the licorice and bourbon slapping you in the face with a bit of unsweetened cocoa
T- coffee and licorice up front, with the dark chocolate and bourbon notes immediately following- very much like the smell, just enough hoppiness to balance out the dark malts and also tasting the alcohol in this beast of a stout
M- decent carbonation, hiding the alcohol rather well, but still very chewy
D- exceptionally well for the strength of this one, understandably burly yet smooth
It isn't perfect, but it really hits the spot, and I will very likely buy one to cellar and sample in the future. 798 charactersBDJake, Nov 14, 2009
4.7/5  rDev +4.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Best After 11/1/2010 on the bottle.
I've had several vintages of The Abyss, but this is first bottle I've sat down to review. Here we go!
A - Pours a deathly dark black. This isn't just a clever name folks. Zero light gets through, no highlights at the edge of the glass when held up to the light, this thing is BLACK. Big, brown head, with amazing lacing.
S - Everything a RIS should be. Big malty, smokey flavors. A decent amount of oak. Bits of sweetness and coffee. Smells awesome.
T - Strong. Lot of alcohol. This one needs some age. Yee Haw! Big coffee flavors. Roasted malt, smoke oak, vanilla, cocoa, alcohol, and just when you can't handle any more, the hops hit you and balance it out. The flavors have not harmonized yet, that is for sure, but each one is there, and delicious. This will only improve over time. The aftertaste is bitter sweet, like a good cup of coffee, with more touches of oak. (This would be a "5" if I sat on it for a year.)
M - Excellent. Full body. Thick, chewy and amazing. Moderate carbonation, which works very well with a beer this big. The finish is crisp and dry. The alcohol dries the tongue nicely.
D - Whoa! While this beer is easily in my top 3 all time, it is one and done. The flavors are amazing. The mouthfeel is perfect. It's just too much to have more than one at a time. The only way I'd crack more than one bottle of this, is if I was doing a vertical with some friends (which I plan to do next year). Fantastic beer, but really, one is all you need. 1,508 charactersGenghis22, Nov 14, 2009
4.3/5  rDev -4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3Poured at room temperature into a snifter. This beer is aptly named, there is no light penetrating this stuff. The appearance is silky dark, thick, and rich. Just looking at it I can already anticipate the flavors and mouthfeel. The barrel aging shines through in the aroma. Very delicate but noticeable leathery smell. Very pleasant and warming. The taste starts out chocolatey but the alcohol quickly punches through in the finish. Some licorice but that's more in the aroma than the taste. Very complex flavor that probably changes with age. I'll have to save a bottle for a few months and compare. This beer is pretty darn thick. Definitely a sipper. 654 charactersDNA, Nov 14, 2009
5/5  rDev +11.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Edit 3/25/2011 from the 2010 edition.
The 2010 The Abyss is aging extremely well. Best after 11/15/11 according to the label, which is still over 6 months away and this is the very best imperial stout I have ever had. It may be the best beer I have had. I rated the un-infected 2009 very high (4.78 as adjusted for the new weighting), but this is perfection for style IMO. I can't imagine a better imperial stout.
The aroma is intensely fragrant. I think Deschutes should develop and market a men's cologne under this trademark. I would wear it gladly. Aroma is a wonderful array of bourbon, vanilla, anise, chocolate and caramel covered graham crackers - yes smores. Awesome for a beer.
Of course it looks absolutely beautiful, for spacious skies, for dark amber waves of barley grain - I get carried away. And very easily on this dark journey that genuinely sheds light. Most mysterious. Has the characteristic Deschutes two finger head and generous lace. Dark as a moonless night. It is the antithesis of the white color spectrum. Truly gorgeous. Finer than any masterpiece in a dusty museum.
Taste is from the nether regions. Deschutes' brewers may be soothsayers, wizards, magicians, or angels, in addition to great cyclocross racers. There is the bourbon from the barrel aging, but there is also a complex sensation of dark chocolate, carmelized brown sugar, molasses, licorice, vanilla bean, and cherries. I love this craft: it is truly amazing what barley, hops, water, and yeast can produce at the hands of the skilled artisan brewer.
Mouthfeel is perfect.
Overall, this may be my favorite beer. It is a great imperial stout. At $12 to $13 a bomber, it is a better value than anything fermented from grapes. At 11% ABV it is a magnificent dark barleywine. Hats off Deschutes. Do you have something even more marvelous in the works called The Stoic? I am ready to submit to the natural law of the brewer.
Only The Abyss, and Pliny the Elder, are beers I have gone out of my way to obtain. Recently, I stopped at every beer store from Portland to Salem in search of this great Abyss that seemingly mysteriously vanished from the shelves early this summer. I found a jackpot in Corvallis, Oregon and bought nearly a case to get me through the winter. 
Highest commendations Deschutes.
"The Abyss beckons. Enjoy the journey."
- From the label.
2009 Reserve. Poured from a 22 oz. bomber into a clear pint glass. Best after 11/1/2010. Couldn't wait. I was already drawn in.
A-Pours a midnight black. Very dark. No light gets through the Abyss. A two finger, creamy tan head with great retention and heavy lacing ensues. A gorgeous craft beer. 
S-Deep, dark chocolate covered caramel, licorice, old fashioned molasses, and bourbon. Aroma was wonderfully intense and prominent. Very nice. 
T-Caramel and roasted malts with tantalizing tastes of dark chocolate, carmelized brown sugar, espresso, molasses, licorice and vanilla bean. I would love to try an ice cream with these combined flavors. The depth and complexity is amazing, and a credit to the brew master's skills. Taste definitely improves as it warms. I imagine this will also improve as it ages. 
M-Robust, but very smooth with medium to full body. Warming due to the alcohol.
D-This is a great beer. Best enjoyed by sipping. The rich, complex flavor profile drew me deeper into the Abyss with each sip. I definitely enjoyed the journey, and enjoyed sharing it with my son. 3,451 charactersvelosuds, Nov 13, 2009
4.58/5  rDev +2.2%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5I haven't reviewed anything in nearly forever. The list of reasons for this is long and distinguished (like my johnson) and, as such, shall not be written here. I will, however, write a review for the Abyss, a beer that I have been keeping around for about a year for various reasons, most of which are some variation of "I was waiting for a special occasion" or "I was too lazy to cut through all the wax on the bottle." Tonight, being neither a special occasion nor a night on which I'm feeling particularly productive, is, nevertheless, the right night for reviewing this beer. So, without further ado...
A- Black as the very night, which is a bit of a misleading description, as the night is not actually entirely black. Neither, though, is this beer, so it's quite appropriate, actually. The dark liquid is topped by a fantastic brown head that is, in fact, so fantastic that I briefly lost my breath upon viewing it.
S- Thankfully I found my breath in time to inhale the aroma of the beer, which was quite nice both because the aroma was excellent and because I didn't die from lack of oxygen to the brain. Dark chocolate, espresso, burnt toast, buttery vanilla, and a hint of whiskey are all present in the aroma. Although that doesn't really do the aroma justice, as it is much more pleasant than I would expect something consisting only of dark chocolate, espresso, burnt toast, buttery vanilla, and whiskey to be.
T- I take a sip, and I hear an angel cry. Or it may be a baby on the TV, I'm not sure. I turn the TV off and take another sip. Nothing. I guess it was the TV. Anyway, the taste is much like the smell, only instead of smelling it, I can actually taste it, which is better. The dark chocolate taste predominates but it is complemented by a wonderful burnt edge. The whiskey flavor is not immediately apparent but it comes through in the form of a richness that doesn't exist in most stouts. That's what this beer's flavor has over most other beers in its class: complexity. Although my palate is not nearly refined enough to pick out all the subtleties in the taste, I can certainly appreciate this beer's depth of flavor. The finish is moderately bitter with an aftertaste of burnt paper... which, somehow, is a good thing here.
M- Extremely smooth, extremely rich, not really extremely thick but thick enough, and extremely good. To the extreme. 
D- Well, I wouldn't normally want to drink an entire bomber of an 11% ABV imperial stout in one sitting, but I want to drink this one. I suppose that's a plus. As far as imperial stouts go, this one is superb in the drinkability department.
I had a Stone IRS, which at one time was one of my absolute favorite beers, last night to see how it would compare with the Abyss. The Abyss beat the life out of it, resuscitated it with a defibrillator, and beat the life out of it again. Now, you might look at the scores I've given these beers in my reviews and ask why this score isn't higher and the Stone score lower. I'll reply by saying, "look, isn't that Garrett Oliver?" and running away. Then, after I think of something to say, I'll come back and tell you it's because I reviewed the Stone IRS a long time ago and my palate and/ or the beer has changed in that period of time. So there. Anyway, if you've been reading this "review" (which we'll call it for the sake of brevity) and wondering if I'd ever get to a point, then wonder no more, because here it is: this is a good beer. If you can get some, I would recommend that you do so at your convenience. Thank you. 3,546 charactersInsolublePancake, Nov 10, 2009
4.52/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 42007 Release drank from the bottle into a chalice for my 250th review. 
It pours a motor oil black with a very dark tan head. It stays pitch black even in the light. The head rises about 1 finger and stays there for about a minute. Tht lacing is light and watery, little small raindrops clining to the glass. 
The aroma is very strong. As I write the review I start to get whiffs of yuminess from about 2 feet away. I really like this smell because unlike most stouts its biggest note isn't coffee. The coffee is there but very subtle so it allows other things to come to the front. I get a lot of sweet cherry, vanilla, bourbon, a smidge of alcohol and a little oak. A very nice combination all the way around. 
The taste is a little of a let down from the aroma because its not as complex, balanced or as sweet as the aroma. Don't get me wrong it is very good, just a little below the high expectations of the aroma. The main taste is coffee from start to finish with a little bitterness, and alcohol at the end. There is also a little vanilla and oak.
The beer itself is full bodied and heavy, and its very long lasting on the palate.
The beer is pretty drinkable for its abv, but comes up a little short of some other stouts. 1,234 charactersjrallen34, Nov 10, 2009
4.95/5  rDev +10.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 52009 reserve bottle.
Appearance - Very dark all the way down to the bottom. Nice tall tan head that holds well. Very frothy looking, the foam sticks to the glass on the way down.
Smell - First thing I notice is a good licorice smell with a toasted hint to it overlayed with the molasses with hints of vanilla and bourbon.
Taste - Toasted flavors with a good molasses/vanilla flavor, can taste the alcohol right at the end. The flavors all tie together really well compared to most beers I have had.
Mouthfeel/Drinkability - Full body, very creamy and pleasing to the palate. Not overly carbonated, I find it incredibly easy to drink which was surprising for such a big beer.
Notes: Easily my new favorite beer. I am a big fan of deschutes beer and this easily the feather in their cap. It has the strong flavors I have come to expect from them because of their beers like Black Butte Porter, and Obsidian Stout. Along with easy drinkability which is something I appreciate about their beers.If you haven't tried this, find a way to you won't be disappointed. I am going to visit my mom this weekend or the next and she lives close to Bend where the brewery is, so I will hopefully try it on tap. I bought three bottles of this, the other two are getting cellared for special occasions. If I had the money I'd go back and buy a case, but alas I am a poor college student so these will have to do for now. Can't wait to try this after it has reached the "best after 11/1/2010", maybe I will save a bottle for next Thanksgiving or Christmas seems like it would go well with a holiday meal anyway. 1,598 charactersyuriruley, Nov 09, 2009

Vintage 2007 Poured into a Bells stemmed Tulip
thick jet black and as the tulip filled, the mocha head rose leaving almost 2 inches worth at the top. slowly disappeared leaving mocha lacing. 
HUGE sweet candy and bourbon notes with subtle hints of dark chocolate and light coffee. quite sweet. a bit of booze. huge for a stout, just huge.
sweet coffee and roasted malts up front. a subtle bourbon flavor mixed in and on the lips. light hints of chocolate buried at the bottom. molasses and licorice were very dominant in the finish and even in the aftertaste. the flavors really have emerged after 2 years. not much booze for 11% ABV. 
thick and syrup, light carbonation and crazy smooth
i am QUITE glad i have a few more of these as this is dangerously drinkable. Deschutes really set the bar high with this release. amazing flavors have me forcing myself to hold back.

A: Pours an opaque black color. I am truly staring into the abyss. A two finger tan head rises with great retention. Tons of sticky spiderweb lace is left behind.
S: Toasted dark malt. Layers of chocolate and vanilla. Some dry woody oak aromas. Light licorice and syrupy molasses. 
T: Follows the nose. Dark toasted malt, but not roasted. I find that interesting. Most stouts of this nature are just overwhelming roasted flavors. A bit more coffee flavor than was in the nose. Some bitter chocolate and vanilla.
M/D: A huge full body that is low on the carbonation. Velvety smooth and creamy. Alcohol is still noticeable a little after two years. I am having no problems finishing the bottle though. A great beer to sip on.
I have had this several times. The first few times, the bottle was pretty much brand new. It was a little raw and rough around the edges. There is still some alcohol here, but it is much more mellow and subtle than previous tastings. Overall, one monster of a beer that is indeed world class. Get some. 1,090 characterschamp103, Nov 06, 2009
4.97/5  rDev +10.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Wow, a beautiful beer with an oatmeal cookie head and this head stood the test of time. 
Head was very malty, a golden brown and not overly sweet. The beer itself had a rich deep color but was not so thick you cannot see light through.
Nose is a good balance of alcohol, malt and has a floral tint.
Taste was great. rich and thick up front. Middle was slightly nutty with malt and a touch of hoppiness. The finish lasts and made me want to sit back and wait for a while before returning.
The head just stayed on top making great lines around the pint glass I was drinking out of.
the body of this beer was well balanced nt too thick but a good coating was left to help sustain a lasting flavor.
I wish i lived closer to where i had this, i will definitley make the trip to get more. 782 charactersWiessmonkey, Nov 05, 2009

Cracked one of these open while camping at about 9 months after release, so it had some age on it.
A. Dense dark and opaque. I can't see any light through this even at the edges. Brown medium head that stays there for a minute, then settles to a thin film that never leaves. Lacing is present.
S. Wow , just wow. Dark chocolate, bourbon, cant wait to taste it.
T. Chocolate and caramel at first, then some mild bitter flavor for just a second, sweet toffee , maybe some coffee, more flavors then i can think of really, each sip of this I can pick out different ones until its gone. Yummy beer, almost like candy really, its that sweet and tasty.
D. Cant detect the alcohol in this at all , its very hidden, but it does have a kick, so cant drink a whole lot of it, but for the % its so damn smooth. 905 charactersArceo, Oct 30, 2009

Pours an oily pitch black with little splashing and a decent two finger head. Lots of legs on the lacing with tiny bubbles throughout the foam. A great looking beer for sure.
The smell is delicious. Dark molasses is up front with a bit of oak in the back, as it warms I can smell a tingle of alcohol coming through in the smell. 
I began reviewing this midway through the bottle due to how good it tastes. I have had the 2008 vintage before and felt the same way about it but with another year on it this beer really shines. Dark molasses, oak, fudgey chocolate cake and alcohol all come through in this. It's such a perfect double stout that I wish Deschutes had the ability to brew this year round and have it available for me to consume locally.
Mouthfeel is a bit thin for the style but it does not take away from it at all. I like it this way for some reason, if it were any more thick it would take away from the drinkability. 
Drinkability is through the roof. I could drink a case of this in one night if I could power through the alcohol.
Overall, this is a must try. When I can, I'm gonna try and get as much as this as I can afford and Liquid Solutions will allow me to order. A fantastic beer. 1,331 charactersauroracrisis, Oct 28, 2009

It is slowly subsiding, leaving an almost complete coating of lace along the circumference of the glass, though it does slowly slide down into the finished product.
Smells surprisingly of flora, oak, hot cocoa, and cookie. The bouquet is actually quite bright. Tastes of intense dark fruits, oak, complex sugars, a touch of licorice. Chocolate liqueur on the midpalate, finishes with black malts and sugar cookie. The flavor is quite intense and palatable for something so strong. A lot of residual sweetness makes this one something to share for me. I'd like to have this beer 100% aged in a spirit barrel. 676 charactersvacax, Oct 15, 2009
4.43/5  rDev -1.1%look: 3 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4wow, yall are crazy for this beer! haha! never had barrel aged beer before? ;)
unlike what a lot of peeps here probably did, i tried to be patient and age mine and wait for a special occassion rather than cracking it open the night i bought it. so, after letting it sit for 10 months i opened it and was not disappointed.
poured into a wide mouthed wine glass the abyss is fairly thick and black as tar. it has a surprisingly large head for such a thick beer. overall, it looks like most all the strong stouts and porters i've had. nothing too spectacular.
what i like the most about barrel aged beers is their smell. this one smells awesome! bananas and toffee are the most dominant. the bourbon barrels are well represented. one whif and i'm salivating.
the taste went something like this:
vanilla/bourbon --&gt; licorice --&gt; chocolate --&gt; stout
each sip provided a complex experience which ended prominently with the same flavor as deschutes' obisdian stout...as well it should since that is the building block of the abyss. however, what's so surprising about the abyss was how much it really DID taste like their obsidian stout. once all the tremendous sweetness and strength faded what remained on the palate was dang near identical to the stout. the aftertaste was the same as well. this was kinda disappointing, especially considering i let it age for an additional 10 months--i was hoping for something a little more unusual. i like the obsidian stout, but it's not my favorite stout. it's not bad though, so having it be at the tail end of the abyss isn't a let down. it will be if you don't like it.
i think the reason people like this beer so much is because they first like the obsidian stout so much. the complexities and flavors of the abyss are to be expected from a bourbon barrel-aged brew, and they are pulled off well here. but if a different, nasty stout was used from the get go i doubt peeps would be fiending over this one. oh yeah, and the cult-following the brewery has along with the nice bottle sure don't hurt the rating either!
peace. 2,077 charactersMadeInOregon, Oct 05, 2009

A HUGE THANKS GOES OUT TO JohnGalt1 for randomly sending me an 07 Abyss. I love BA
A- the names Abyss what do you expect. pitch black liquid produces the darkest of brown head. can't ask for a better looking stout.
S- so much going on here. a ton of smells bouncing around, daring you to dive in. here I come
T- I feel overwhelmed when having to think about describing this beer. the depth of flavors is incredible. I pick up big flavors from the coffee, chocolate, oak barrels and licorice. more in the back round is another layer, what I taste includes a nice subtle hint of the bourbon barrels, dark fruits, and just enough bitterness from the coffee hop combo to notice that it is bitter. 
M/D- perfect viscosity for a stout of this magnitude. thick and oh so rich. the carbonation really sets off the bitterness provide by the coffee. rarely do I taste a beer and notice the mouthfeel enhancing the beer as well as this. 
Can't give The Abyss a perfect score here. as a lover of a good stout I would drink this all day long, or atleast untill I pass out drunk, but I definitely drink this one a good bit slower than most of my other beverages. whether its the fact that I don't want this beer to ever leave my side or it's just a fact that it's a BIG beer and can't be dominated, I'll never know. 1,343 charactersFreethyhops, Oct 01, 2009

It was his birthday and I'm glad I could split it with my homie.
Poured like used 40W motor oil. Almost black, inch high brown head that fizzled out quickly. Blame it on the al-al-al-al-cohol... sorry, I'll stop that now... 
Aroma of dark chocolate, raisins, and piney hops. Diidn't expect to have any hop aroma and was actually surprised.
Dark chocolate/bittersweet flavor, licorice, caramel and smooth as hell. Couldn't taste the booze in it.
Thick mouthfeel, full bodied and heavy on the palate. This stuff coats your tounge and gets all up in your palate.
I could drink this silky smooth crack all day if I didn't value my liver or figure. True, it may not be the best I've had, but damn Gina! One fine as hell RIS. I just hope the next bottle doesn't require me going to the ends of the earth (or Oregon) to get it. 1,087 charactersdavexisxrabid, Sep 15, 2009
4.48/5  rDev 0%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.52007 Vintage.
Poured into rare vos gold rimmed glass.
Pours 1 finger of dark tan head. Amazing retention with great lace walls. Color is a deep motor oil black. Wow, this is one of the best looking beers I have seen.
Aroma: Cocoa, vanilla, bourbon, oak, licorice, roasted malts. Wow, this beer flows so well. Very complex and rich. Simply awesome. 
Taste: The components of this beer blend so well together. Rich oak, cocoa, vanilla, bourbon, roasted malts. I really can't taste the high abv except in the smooth bourbon.
Mouthfeel: Rich, smooth, creamy, and just the slightest amount of heat. Full bodied with a medium amount of carbonation. Ends with a fairly clean aftertaste, a little dry and roasted malt flavored.
Overall, this beer is simply stunning. I split this with a buddy and my half is going fast. I wish I had an entire bottle of this for myself, but I am happy to share it. Drinkable, amazing, great. I want more. 935 charactersmothman, Sep 13, 2009
4.33/5  rDev -3.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.522 oz bottle served in a chalice glass.
A - 1 1/2 inches of dark tan head holds it's own before leaving some nice lacing. The beer is pitch black, just as the name states, an abyss. 
S - Heavy roasted malts, and sweet molasses. There is also a slightly boozy, bourbon aroma.
M - A full-bodied stout with a smooth, creamy feel to it. Well carbonated.
T - Strong roasted malts up front followed by some molasses and dark chocolate. There's also a bit of dark fruit and then it finishes up with a roasty, dry aftertaste.
An excellent Russian Imperial Stout. The alcohol content is well hidden, and this makes a perfect night cap. 631 charactersboralyl, Sep 09, 2009

A - Jet black with a lasting brown head.
S - Dark fruit, coffee, and chocolate. Chocolate really dominates. Aroma is pretty intense overall.
T - Toasted malts, strong coffee and molasses flavors. Loads of milk chocolate. Also some hints of dark fruit and oak barrel.
M - Thick and oily but not to a fault. Creamy, full, and smooth on the palate.
D - Actually very drinkable for an RIS. Maybe my tolerance for this type of beer is higher than other peoples'. 616 charactersnickd717, Sep 08, 2009
4.35/5  rDev -2.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Chestnut brownish black with a cocoa colored thick and frothy head that rises up over and inch and lingers long, slowly settling and leaving oily ringlets and legs of lace reaching up and round the glass.
Rich and inviting aroma of dark chocolate and espresso, darkly roasted malt, subtle smoke.
Flavor is initially sharp and assertive, bitter dark chocolate and strong espresso, notes of leather and charred bark. Dark brown sugar and molasses chime in, and intense bitterness keeps any malt sweetness at bay. Notes of marshmallow and licorice weave in and out along with oaked woody flavors. ABV is well hidden and doesn't detract from the flavor.
Even mouthfeel, creamy but not overly full, finishes tingly, a little tannic and woody. Minor alcohol warmth.
Very tasty beer, scarily smooth and drinkable for such a big beer. A nice sipper. Many thanks to Sparky27 for throwing in such an amazing beer as an extra. 919 charactersfar333, Aug 30, 2009

It's a little on the sweet side as far as my own personal taste for the RIS goes - I prefer something a bit drier like Bear Republic's Big Bear Black Stout, but this is a world class beer, all preferences aside. This particular bottle has been sitting in my pantry for almost a year, and although I'd have preferred to let it age a bit longer it's been an exceptionally hot summer in Texas (hottest on record for Austin) and I thought I should open it. I had it with some nice, well-aged cheddar cheese and a halfway decent cigar. They both complemented the beer perfectly. Life is good. 719 charactersomnigrits, Aug 23, 2009

4.33/5  rDev -3.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Poured into a tulip, huge brown head , black body, lots of lacing. 
Smell is a little weaker than i expected, but its still good, i get the creaminess from the oak, some charcoal as well, with chocolate and a bit of heat as well.
The taste is much better than the smell, and the smell is damn good. I get that charred oak right off the bat, along with chocolate, and some boozey heat. the mid-palate is more creamy, with some bourbon vanilla notes hidden way back there. The only negative to this beer, is the finish, its a bit raw, not really boozey heat, just bitter from the roasted grains and licorice. I like bitter beers but this seems a bit disjointed compared to the rest of the flavor profile.
All in all this is one hell of a beer though. 748 charactersredneckchugger, Aug 13, 2009

4.28/5  rDev -4.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4I can't believe I've never reviewed this beer as it's one of my favorites. 2007 vintage, poured into a Deschutes stemmed snifter.
Great appearance with a solid 3 finger head from a vigorous pour, which is chocolate colored. Sticks to the glass.
Aroma of dusty baker's chocolate, dusty chocolate malt, and some isopropyl alcohol.
Rich flavors, more of the dusty chocolate. Firm but faded noble hop bitterness. Lots of maltose sweetness, finishing with an aromatic roasted bitterness like chocolately coffee. Some higher alcohols, a tiny bit hot, which I attribute to bourbon barrel aging.
Mouthfeel is creamy, sticky, and slightly chalky. It's nearly perfect for the style. Some of the smoothness of oatmeal and a bit of the drying tannins of the oak.
Drinkability is good for the style. It's a sipper that keeps you interested. 
I admit I'm biased because I like the 2006 the best, and I didn't care for 07 or 08 nearly as much fresh. 07 has turned out to be much more to my liking, and it has a long way to go in the cellar before peaking. Cheers 1,053 charactersrayjay, Aug 12, 2009

Pour was excellent, a small head coming up at the end. Black as oil, with some light brown lacing on the glass.
Could definitely smell the licorice in here. Was a great blend of the 1/3 barrel aged...just enough to let you know that it was there, but not overwhelming, and certainly not masking the depth of this brew.
Taste was exceptional. The 11+% was well hidden, leaving me wanting to crack open a second bottle.

A - this is perfect. no getting around it. there is plenty of head to go around (hehe), and the body is about black as the midnight sun. head is a dark brown, has amazing retention, and has lacing to boot. there is nothing wrong with this beer: the amount of head is perfect, the colour of the head is perfect, and the body is a super dark brown, just not quite black (but who the hell care, or can tell). nothing more to report; this beer looks perfect (and talk about lacing for an RIS!)
S - malty, fruity, boozy. this is pretty good, but I think I like the way the dark lord, which I just had, tastes. let me have it warm up a bit. this is the beer that makes me wake up; it smells amazing, but the only problem is intensity. top notes are molasses malts, maybe a bit of coffee. the molasses-caramel malts are the most prevalent in the top nose. mid-notes of chocolate and a sweeter fruit quite easy to pick up, bottom notes of coffee, hops and licorice. let's drink this bitch.
T - sweet holy Jesus this is amazing. the initial taste is chocolate coffee malty booze exposition in my mouth. goddamn. there are also some brief hops, and the malt is undeniably sweet as it makes the rounds around the parts fo the mouth. the chocolate coffee initial taste is so amazing: it really tastes like I am finishing off a Godiva dark chocolate bar with a big mug of espresso. But there is even more!: the booze begins to develop into this spicy kind of rum flavor as its is swished in the mouth. this is one of the most complicated ris's i have ever had, and is easily deserving of the number two spot in the RIS category; lets move onto the finish: undeniable chocolate coffee flavours, while some bourbon is also present. the finish is majestic, like a bald eagle bourlying around the rocky mountains, while holding an american flag. the aftertaste is actually like a bunch of pixies in your mouth, making love to your tongue. in actuality the ftertaste is like a chocolate whiskey, with a medium strong hop presence. quite perfect if i have ever had a good ris before. the taste itself is malty and more of the chocolate taste; maybe it shouldnt be a 5 for this part of the tasting, but the whole is so good that I cannot think of anything that could make it any better.
MF&D - the feel is a bit too thin when compared to the dark lord of 09. the drinkability is not affected by thin, anyways. it is so delicious that it wouldnt matter if it drank like lava, the beer is too good to refuse one, even if it is the dead of summer.
this is an amazing beer with touches of burbon, licorice, chocolate, and coffee. the excellence cannot be denied, but there are improvements to be made. 2,782 characterserz316, Aug 10, 2009

A- Pitch black, no transparency. Fluffy 1 inch tan head. 
S- Coffee, alcohol, chocolate, licorice. The list could go on and on because the smell and taste is very complex and its hard to pick up everything going on. 
T- Absolutely amazing. In my opinion, the best beer I have had to date. Licorice comes through very well with a decent amount of coffee and chocolate. Delicious roasted malt flavors. Not very "smokey". Finishes with a somewhat nutty flavor. Incredible. Towards the end the coffee flavor starts to stack up on the palate. 
M- carbonation is perfect and on the high side for a stout. 
D- Watch out! Drinkability is extremely high because the alcohol can barely be detected for its ABV. Probably wont ever drink more than one because you will want to sip and savor the complexity of this beer, but if it came down to it, I could drink as many as it took for me to pass out. 
Overall, excellent beer. With a year of age on it, the alcohol is almost completely hidden and the beer is super smooth. WOW 1,024 charactersaewinte1, Aug 04, 2009

This is obviously an incredible beer. So much going on you have to sit with it for a long time.
The beer pours a motor oil black with brown highlights all over the place. The head erupts from within the beer and it a glossy dark brown. Sticky lacing clings to the inside of the glass. The head does eventually fade to a thin cap, but that takes quite a while.
The aroma evolves while you drink the beer. My first whiff was of black licorice. Then there was dark chocolate notes and later even some wood/oak notes. Definitely some molasses as well. It truly did change over time. Much like the flavor.
Amazingly complex. We literally took out a bottle of molasses to smell and taste. This was a great way to identify this on both the aroma and flavor. It's there. So is the licorice. Subtle but evident. The chocolate notes seemed to run throughout but not as much as some coffee notes. I commented that I got more chocolate in aroma but more coffee in the flavor. Also some brown sugar flavors. As it warms different items become evident and it was great fun to experience these changes.
The mouth feel is big, bold and thick. A little to acidic to be called creamy, but it's very smooth on the tongue. Very subtle carbonation.
A treat to drink and one to savor and enjoy with a friend over a couple of hours. 1,488 charactersReagan1984, Aug 03, 2009
4.18/5  rDev -6.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 42008 vintage. 
A: Pitch black (and I really mean pitch black) with a very big, brown head that leaves plenty of lacings.
S: A very pleasant, fine-tuned and balanced smell. Lots of roasted malts, some licorice and notes of dark fruits and chocolate. As the beer warms up, the bourbon notes get a little more prominent. 
T: The taste is really good and showcases a good balance between lots of different flavors. There's lots of things going on here, but its still manages to come out as clean and easy on the palate. Plenty of sweet and roasted malts. Notes of wood and some charcoal. Some vanilla, molasses, burnt sugar and dark fruits. Even tough the beer is sweet, it's not as sweet as I had expected and definitely not cloying. The bourbon makes a subtle appearance every now and then. The finish is great with a pleasant bitterness to it and some warming alcohol, but most importantly a rather powerful and lingering taste of licorice that seems to lie as a separate layer of its own, detached from the the rest of the flavors in the finish. 
M: Big body with a slightly sticky, but still smooth, texture. Carbonation is good. 
D: A very good imperial stout. Well balanced and actually quite easy to drink. The contributions from the licorice in this one are a work of art. 1,282 charactersricke, Aug 02, 2009
4.68/5  rDev +4.5%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4The pièce de résistance in a trade with xpimptastikx
Poured into a snifter.
A- A no so gentle pour yields a one finger head thats litterally the same color as the label. Its a bubbly dark brownish red. It fades into an amorphous sheet floating in the middle of a brown ring that leaves a little bit of lacing. The rest is so black theres nothing else that can be said really.
S- Strong, sweet, rich. Both coffee and chocolate come on hard in the nose. Swirling brings out the real character. Licorice, dark fruits like plums and fig, and bourbon-like alcohol.
T- Milky chocolate comes in up front and brings the coffee with it. Im picking up a little bit of the licorice in the middle right after some fruitiness. Fruits like in the nose, fig, plum, raisin. The fruitiness is brief, it gives way to more coffee bitterness.
The hops are only perceivable in the aftertaste for me. They are earthy and not overly strong.
M- Very creamy, medium carbonation. Dry and sticky.
D- Very good, the alcohol is very very well hidden. This beer is very sticky and the flavors linger for quite some time. 1,097 charactersMbpBugeye, Jul 30, 2009
4.3/5  rDev -4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.52008 bottle.
Not much I can say that hasn't been said, but I'll give it a try anyway...
Pours black and opaque. Not a hint of light getting through, even around the edges. Minimal cocoa colored head, drops within a minute or so to a scant covering. 
Aroma is licorice and cocoa in equal doses. A bit of a scent that reminds me of chocolate covered malted milk balls is also present. A tiny hint of roasted barley.
A bit of just about everything I would expect. Licorice, grains with a dark roast, chocolate. And it's all good. Real good. The thing that surprises me the most though, is the strong fruitiness. Not out of balance, but definitely a big part. A bit of sweet/tart plum, and to a lesser degree some cherry, really add another dimension. A minimum amount of hops, citric and sunny. They're faint, but provide a nice counter to this malt forward beer. I'm picking up only a little bit of alcohol.
Amazingly balanced, medium bodied, and unbelievably drinkable. This is a real treat. I have one bottle left, and will be saving it for a special occasion, to be sure. I rate the drinkability high however, because if I had more, I would drink this regularly! Cheers. 1,176 charactersdancinwillie, Jul 26, 2009
2.76/5  rDev -38.4%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 2 | feel: 3 |  overall: 2So, yeah. We had an RIS tasting. This was to be the highlight of the event.
Black. Nice head that lasts. Perfect. Unreal. Beautiful. Opaque like nobody's business.
Smells like an RIS - rich, dark, sweet, chocolate, coffee and more coffee, burned mesquite.
Tastes like mesquite ashes and coffee grounds. Bleh. Little residual sweetness. Lots of dark and bitter things going on. Another over-the-top beer. Sure, i can see why beer geeks would go crazy over it but it's not anything like, well, a good beer. Where is the balance in there, hmm? I'd think it would need more sweetness and a lot more time before being released before it was even close to being ready.
Seems to me that the body is on the thinner side but that's prolly just 'cause i don't think it sweet enough (for balance with all of the other stuff going on). It would prolly be fine if you toned the flavors down.
I would not seek this out (or even drink it) if it were readily available to me except for trading purposes because you all are so crazy for it.
So, in terms of the RIS tasting this was SOUNDLY panned as being poorly made, unbalanced, not very interesting. My score, here, is greatly inflated compared to the remarks given on this one. Heck, it was one of only 2 or 3 out of 20+ bottles we drank where there was some left at the end of the night - and we had this one fourth. So not worth the hype it isn't even funny. 1,399 characterscharlesw, Jul 26, 2009
4.67/5  rDev +4.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5From Notes. 
Shared a bottle of this with the pops the other night. 2007 vintage alongside a chocolate cupcake with coconut buttercream icing. 
I really like the way the 2007 is drinking right now. Too bad I never have/never will get to try the 2006. 
Pours black as night with a healthy mocha head. 
Chocolate cake (no, not the cupcake). Very intense and bordering on thick. Deep roasted malt and espresso, some bitterness coming through (not from hops). Bourbon presence is not upfront you have to know what you're looking for- it presents itself in a vague vanilla sweetness that aids in cloaking the alcohol. It seems to me that the licorice is more present than when I have had this previously which I would've thought would urge me to like it less- but that was not the case. (Because I'm not a huge fan of licorice) 
Overall, The Abyss is the real deal- everything you want in an RIS from the flavors to the mouthfeel and beyond. It's great to see a beer of this caliber made in reasonable quantities such that people can obtain it without too much difficulty. 1,072 charactersIneedabeerhere, Jul 23, 2009

A- Pours black in color with no other colors peeking through it as I hold it up to the light. Good 1 figner dark tan head that stays there for a litte bit before going down and leaving massive amounts of sticky thick lacing on the sides of the glass. Great looking beer!
S- Not much for any certain strong aromas in the nose. I smell a good amount of burnt malts along with a good coffee and chocolate balance with this. I can pick up on the licorice with this beer as well in the balance. Slight hint of alcohol in this one as well. Make my mouth water then I smell this.
T- I finally see what all the hype is about this beer. Nice big upfront of a chocolate and coffee malt to it. Some oakiness present I think as well. The earthy hops are faint in this but still come through just for a second before becoming nothing as the licorice comes through and dominates for a second. This beer is amazing and I'm not the biggest fan of this style but....well...wow this is fantasic.
M- Medium-heavy mouthfeel. Carbonation is perfect with this beer as it melts across the palate in so many flavors. Leaves traces of chocolate and coffee with a little licorice on the tounge. A pleasure to have in the mouth and the aftertaste makes you want more.
D- This is a very drinkable beer of which I had more of this year. I can't get over how good this beer is. I only wish this wasn't my only bottle of this year. Thanks to Mike once again for the hook up and glad to take the advice and drink it now. 1,586 charactersalleykatking, Jul 22, 2009

But is it worth it?
Hell yes. I will not get into Abyss' flavours, or how smooth and complex it is, or how it feels silky smooth on the tongue. All that notwithstanding, this is one damn fine stout. I love Expedition. The Abyss keeps all of Expedition's flavour, but smooths it out and makes it into a beer that's even stronger, but will be hard to find a tongue that doesn't like it. A really nice beer, and worth seeking out. 752 charactersDaveFL1976, Jul 17, 2009

Smell is surprisingly mild for a beer that is robust in every other aspect. What is present is impressive, though, with a nice balance between coffee, chocolate and licorice.
The flavor is full of bready chocolate malts, coffee and a licorice character that borders on the fruity. Not overly sweet, this drys on the finish. Delicious.
Full bodied with aggressive effervescence that causes a slight burning sensation. Creamy and oily.
The flavors in this are so dense, and with the richness in body, this beer is a definite sipper. The alcohol is well hidden and the sweetness is just at the right level. 
An absolutely fantastic beer that lives up to every bit of the hype. Easily one of the best stouts I've had, the weight on smell here is the only thing keeping this from being one of my most highly rated beers. Get it. 967 charactersphotomike, Jul 16, 2009

I am not going to be able to add much to the description of this beer that has not already been written.
I have enjoyed many Imperial Stouts, to date nothing has come close to this beer in the category, by a longshot. 
I'd say I am just trying to be realistic in not giving it fives across the board, in that without having tried every RIS available I am trying to be fair. Still this is a world class and incredibly complex and delicious beer. 530 charactersPBoegel, Jul 13, 2009
5/5  rDev +11.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Ah... so ends an era. *Sigh* This was the last bottle I drank from my Christmas gift to myself from '08. Sadly, I foresee dark times and lots of cheap beer in my future. And so it was that I opened this final bomber on 4/20/09 and shared it with my good friend John to celebrate all I once was and all I hope to someday be again. Into our glasses the brew was a used-motor-oil black color. The two-fingers of wood-brown head displayed excellent retention as a skim and collar that left sticky lacing throughout the sample. The aroma was complex, full of milk and dark chocolate, dry cocoa, roasted malt, dark fruit, alcohol and oak. Rich, sweet and very appealing. The flavors were also outstanding and highly complex. Starting with chocolate and toffee it then went into dark caramel, alcohol, sweet pipe tobacco, lots of oak and coffee. The balance between the sweet malty elements and the bitter hoppy notes was superb. As it warmed the chocolate continued to waft forth, encouraging us to dink more. The mouthfeel was creamy and smooth, the body full and the carbonation on-point for a RIS. A joy to drink and surprisingly gulp-able, this was one of the finest beers I had ever tasted and it deserves to be honored amongst the best in the world. 1,249 charactersthekevlarkid, Jul 06, 2009

opaque, midnight black. coffee brown head is big and foamy. fades to a constant thin layer, or at least thick wisps and ring. thin rings of lacing at first, then mostly just some big patchy splotches.
aroma: mild oak and vanilla, hint of something approaching chocolate, but maybe more carob and coffee. molassess and caramel malt. hint of figs and dates. bourbon is very mild, melding nicely. whiff of mash acidity.
taste: caramel and roasted malt, with oak, vanilla and mild bourbon again. coffee, faintly mocha, with earthy hop, giving a moderate to bold bitterness with touch of mash and coffee-like acidity. light, dried cherry fruitiness peeks in before a very coffee finish. maybe a touch of licorice?
medium body (a bit lighter than expected, perhaps?), lightly syrupy, with moderate astringency in the finish giving texture and body. mild carbonation helps assist in creamy perception.

4.28/5  rDev -4.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 42008 vintage poured into my trusty New Belgium globe
Pours a big 3 finger dense head that looks like chocolate ice cream. Body is pitch black in color. Head retention and lacing are pretty good.
Smell is big on roasted chocolate malt and some coffee. Hops and alcohol are faint in the background
Taste is a very good balance of malts and hops. First the burnt, roasted malt is tasted, then the earthy bitter hops come in. The alcohol is present but not too much and leaves a slight warming sensation down the back of my throat. The after taste is of smoke from the oak and malt and some bitterness from the hops. Very tasty and complex
Head gives a nice creaminess to the beer. Almost perfect amount of carbonation, livens up the body making it rich but not too heavy
Drink ability is good. Very flavorful and rich but still semi session able. I love stouts and this one is definitely one of the best. It kind of reminded me of Stone IRS but with the benefit of aging. Will need to pick up alot more of these when the new batch comes out in the fall
*Update- had a 2010 vintage on 06/02/14, flavors seem to have dulled noticeably 1,135 charactersangelmonster, Jun 27, 2009
4.53/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5A 2007 vintage to celebrate my actual birthday (thanks for the trade drseamus). I have had tastes, but have been looking forward to sitting down and enjoying this. Pours a dark/opaque black, no light getting through this one, and a solid 3 finger tan head. The aroma is a little more subdued than I had anticipated. Certainly a delicious smelling brew, with aromas of roasted malt, chocolate, and espresso coming through, but not as strong as some other imperial stouts I have had. The oak is even more subdued, maybe I served this a tad warm? The taste, however, was not subdued at all, a lovely compilation of all the flavors I enjoy in a good strong stout. A strong, sweet chocolate flavor up front, pairs nicely with the coffee flavor. These flavors mellow as you sip it, possibly due to the earthy oak flavor. Not sure where it comes from, but a nice tart bitterness kick comes through on the back end, in addition to a bourbony warmth. I still feel this could age longer, as I love when these stouts get even thicker in the mouthfeel. There is certainly an alcohol warmth that follows a few sips. Its hard to establish drinkability on such a big stout, but within its category, this is a pleasing stout to drink, and I thoroughly enjoyed sipping on it over the course of the evening. Looking forward to drinking more in the future for sure. 1,346 charactersbhalter8, Jun 26, 2009
4.4/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Shared an '08 vintage with the girlfriend not too long ago. Reviewed from notes.
Pours an opaque black with a thick and creamy two-finger mocha head that fades extremely slowly to a skim coat and sticky ring. A few wisps of lace left behind.
Smell is just amazing! Lots of rich chocolate, bourbon, oak, molasses, and a hint of anise.
Taste is toasty oak and chocolate up front, before some bourbon and espresso notes. Alcohol heats up a little towards the finish, but quickly subsides before some molasses and a rich, chocolaty finish.
Thick, creamy, full-bodied mouthfeel. 
Drinkable and extremely enjoyable. A world class sipper for sure. Psyched to see how this one will develop over time. 697 charactersMrMonkey, Jun 26, 2009
3.98/5  rDev -11.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.5One fine Saturday brunch found myself and an '08 Abyss in a gastronomical mood. So poaching a few local, free range eggs to accompany a Herve Mons camembert and sweet pepper relish on marble rye sandwich, I felt this was an ideal time to stare uninterrupted into the Abyss. Aggressively pouring the thick elixir into the St. Bernardus chalice...I like to wake up high gravity beers as much as possible...I notice the tremendous frothy carbonation that sits atop for almost the entire session. This really sets it apart from the other contenders in its class. It helps to lift taste from being just cloying and heavy. Aromatically, it fills the room. There is almost a mist that surrounds the glass of purely hedonistic levels of licorice, brown sugar, coffee, vanilla and chocolate. A slight amount of boozy heat, but nothing a few years asleep in the cellar wouldn't resolve. It amazing to think how five years or so ago that beers of these proportions did not exist. Lucky us! This is the part that I like best...one long, slow contemplative sip without distraction. This creation is full of point-counterpoints of sweet/bitter, heavy/light, not enough/too much. The licorice is slightly prominent. The anise in absinthe comes to mind. Dark Horizon, that delicious licorice bomb, comes to mind. I have had this and the '07 on many occasions before now, but this is the first time I have really appreciated this character. I have become so enamored with bourbon in beers that I almost feel like something is missing. Though I feel like this is complete. The good folks at Deschutes realized their ideal. I like it. I would like to have cases of it. Dark Lord it is not. There is a creamy, earthy nuttiness on the finish that I really enjoy, but becomes increasingly difficult to get past the licorice. The alcohol is more evident and that is to be expected. World class beer that needs some time. 1,897 charactersSteamhead, Jun 25, 2009

A: Opaque black, thick and viscous as it comes out of the bottle, with a dark tan/ light brown head of about 1 finger, settling into a thin foam and lacing lightly.
S: Big wows here, with grains, malts, esters, nuts, chocolate and a whiff of anise.
T: Big, dark roasted coffee, chocolate, malt and some bitterness from those and from hops. Full of flavors but not boozy or out of balance. 
M: Again, balanced and full without excess weight. Exceptionally smooth for such a big beer. Hides its 11% well. Picks up bitterness on the finish, which gives it some palate traction.
D: High marks, very drinkable. Bottle went pretty fast. 
Overall, a superb brew. Deserves all the accolades it gets. This is the second time I've had the 2008, and it was outstanding again. Worth seeking out. Best stout period. 908 charactersnectar14, Jun 21, 2009
4.97/5  rDev +10.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 522oz bottle. 2008, split courtesy of Viggo - you're pretty much my beer hero now for every beer that I wished I had tried - you have it "sitting in your fridge".
Pours a viscous black, a finger of dark mocha head that subsides to pretty much nothing - par for a big stout.
Nose is smooth vanilla, roasting malts, milk chocolate.
Taste is ridiculously smooth. Wow, for the ABV this is so smooth and so delicious I could drink it all night. Smooth roasted malts, a good dose of molasses and licorice, just the right dash of woodiness, roasted malts that have the right amount of punch but not too much bitterness - just enough to make it deep and rich without being overwhelming. 
Holy crap this beer is smooth and enticing, it could seduce me into just about anything. Thanks for the immense treat Eric, this made my move just so damn worth it. 847 charactersritzkiss, Jun 21, 2009

Beautiful, viscous stout, just like the oughtta be.
An incredibly smooth nose that drove through my nostrils and into my brain. Delicious! 
A kind mouthfeel with strong tastes of burnt coffee, molasses, black licorice, and even a little vanilla. 
Absolutely wonderful and I would drink this smooth sucker every single day of the year but it did not completely knock my socks off. Fantastic nonethless.

4.58/5  rDev +2.2%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured into an unmarked belgian goblet at cellar temperature this beer has a pitch black color with a deep tan, frothy head.
The aromas are roasty and of dried fruit (figs, raisons, plums). There's plenty of deep roasted malt as well.
The flavors are rich and mildly sweet - more so than I would have expected. I really did enjoy the full and long flavors of this amazing stout.
The mouthfeel was thinner than I expected but great none-the-less. I think carbonation was perfect and the alcohol content made for the perfect consistency.
The drinkability was decent despite the 11% abv. I would drink this beer all day if given the chance (within reason of course). I will definately be searching this great beer out again. 725 charactersPerzentRizen, Jun 06, 2009
4.6/5  rDev +2.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 42008 Abyss
Appearance-Pours thick and deep black beer with a two finger, creamy tan head. 
Smell- Coffee with a deep bitter and dark fruits, some wood barrel. Hints of sweet licorice and chocolate.
Taste-An early rush of strong espresso coffee is quickly overwhelmed by wood cask and dark fruits. Smooth for the style with some creamy yeast and a surprisingly mild aftertaste. 
Mouthfeel- Big body and flavor without chunkiness of some barrel aged stouts. 
Drinkability- Not sure how "drinkable" an 11% barrel aged stout can, but it is the smoothest I've had yet.
Great with a pipe or cigar. 597 charactersolmatty, Jun 05, 2009

Smell is delight. Chocolate, roasted malt, burnt caramel, and dark fruits. Vanilla and cherries. 
Taste is exceptional, superb. Smooth and rich with all of the nose and more. A bit more charcoal and burnt sugar. Definitely more coffee and yeasty pumpernickel. Vanilla and oakey rum. There is a tart cherry with more fruits and you can peel layer after layer like an onion and never exhaust the complexity of this brew. Feel is full and velvety. A mild creamy carbonaion and light syrup consistency. 
Drinkaility is beyond the abv. You can put this one down like a Guiness but it hits hard folks so apply caution.

4.53/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Huge thanks to RichBeer for this world class beer. Vintage 2008, 22 oz. bottle, poured into my Stone Imperial Russian Stout tulip.
A: Pure black, just one hue lighter than used motor oil. One and a half fingers of wet sand colored head appears. The lace is incredible, thick and spidery. After about 5 min. in the glass, and many sips, the head is still 3/4 of an inch, outstanding!
A: Very complex. I get the usualls for the style: dark chocolate, molasses, some coffee, and roasted nuts. But some subtle vanilla, toffee, raisin, and cherry tones come through.
T: I finally get the oak and burbon barrels here. The slight burbon taste, IMHO, accentuates the vanilla and cherry flavors. I get the chocolate upfront, and the roasted coffee bean in the back. The hops take a back seat in this one, but none the less, the earthiness of the hop comes through and trys to give it some balance. As the Abyss warms the alcohol gives this a very nice heat.
M: Very heavy body. The low level of carbonation, and the oak and burbon barrel aging give this an extremely smooth mouthfeel. 
D, and overall impression: Due to the high ABV, 11%, and the viscosity of the brew, I could not have many of these. But, probably one of the three best RIS I've had. I don't know if it is as complex as Dark Lord, but I definately think Abyss beats it in the taste department. Overall, this is a fantastic beer, and worth seeking out. Absolutely worthy of consideration for best beer in the world. Skal. 1,484 charactersGtreid, May 30, 2009

Poured like 10W-30 that was long overdue for an oil change into a tumbler with about two fingers of brown head. Lacing all the way down.
Smell of chocolate, coffee, licorice and alcohol.
Not much carbonation and a nice warm feeling.
Tastes like chocolate coffee and dark malt with lots of alcohol warmth. Some oak flavor also. One is enough for one day but one day is not enough. 
This is a delicious stout that will only get better with age. 462 charactersjsapunor, May 29, 2009

A: Pours a dark dark black with a ton of great looking darker shade of khaki head, almostr four fingers of it in my La Fin Du Monde tulip glass, lots of lacing on the glass.
S: Smells of slight roast, chocolate, some dark fruits, slightly alcoholic scent, and yes a little bit of licorice
T: The upfront flavor is amazing, but the finish leaves a little to be desired. I'm wondering if a little more age on this will smooth it out (as I've heard). I taste roastiness, bitter chocolate, slight vanilla and oak flavor, licorice towards the end, some licorice, but i doubt i'd know that if it weren't on the bottle! some alcohol tinge in the finish.
M: Really diggin the mouthfeel on this RIS. It defies my previous knowledge of beers by somehow being super creamy, yet thin AND low carbonation with lots of bubbles. Some warming sensation from the booze.
D: I won't lie and say this is the most drinkable RIS ever. The flavor is quite good, but the alcohol finish takes this down a bit. As I said before, with some age I think this beer would go from great to epic. 1,135 charactersdukedevil0, May 27, 2009
4.01/5  rDev -10.5%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.52009 UPDATE, original review text below. Original score was a 5/5/5/5/4.5. Not sure if my palate has changed or if this batch just has changed but it is WAAYYY different than I remember. The complexity in the nose was mostly gone, replaced by a strong coffee profile that was good but not really anything special. The taste was a big departure from what I remember...basically this vintage was just coffee, hops, and oak. Didn't catch any of the toffee, licorice, or chocolate that I talked about in my previous notes. Really, this beer just wasn't a stand out at all. The 2008 that I had was a couple months old and this one is fresh, but even a little maturing can't really explain the drastic differences in these two brews. I am going to drop my scores to reflect the changes. I'm not trying to say that this is suddenly a bad beer--because it is still really good, but the differences truly are astounding. I will open another bottle in 6-12 months and see if it has recaptured the magic of my original bottle.
2008 release
A--Pours pitch black with two fingers of brown head in my Dogfish Head signature glass. Lacing coats the whole glass like a paint job. 
S--Chocolate, toffee, hops, oak, faint coffee and licorice. Big, bold, clean, fresh smelling stout. Definitely let this one sit for a bit, I had it too cold at first which really muted the nose.
T--Is this it? Is this the stout I have been looking for? Maybe....no doubt that this is absolutely amazing. Chocolate and oak are the two prominent flavors on my palate...there is a nice hop character to balance out the roastiness but don't get it twisted this is still a big and roasty. Just how I like it. And amazingly complex. Toffee, licorice, coffee, cream, faint dark fruits. One of the best tasting stouts I've ever had, period.
M--Full bodied, a bit of a carbonation sting. Coats the mouth a leaves a nice bitter aftertaste.
D--A sipper at 11% but so interesting it can't be put down for long. 1,969 charactersalcstradamus, May 22, 2009

A- this one comes out of the bottle black as can be with a finger and a half of coffee colored head. the head lasts a long time and leaves a wall of lacing on the glass. cant ask for anything more from this style. perfect. 
S- i immediately checked the bottle to make sure that only 1/3 of this was aged in bourbon casks. you can smell it and strong. vanilla, oak, and bourbon all come through and strong. loads of roasted malts in here as well as chocolate--mostly dark but milk as well (a slight sweetness). it smells strong, very strong. kind of a turn off but not a huge one. the excitement is building. some coffee/hops in here also. well done. 
T- as in the nose, the tiny portion of this that was aged in bourbon barrels makes itself known. tons of wood, vanilla, and bourbon. lots of chocolate also, but not an overwhelming amount. and of course roasted malts. coffee/hops....it just doesnt quit. its potent tasting, somewhat dry, and extremely complex. exceeds expectations and deserves its unbelievably high ranking on this site. 
M- full bodied and chewy. its thick, but not dark lord thick. i cant give a perfect rating for this style after ive tried dark lord. theres a warming from the alcohol as it goes down, but its not overly strong and adds to the experience. this is a serious beer and it demands respect.
D- this is possibly my new favorite beer. the sort of thing that i would save my beer money for weeks before it came out...if i could buy it where i lived. what a shame. thanks again to brokenleadedcask for this bottle, and to mba3243 for my 07 bottle thats still waiting. wow. check this one out, its going to be worth the trouble. 1,745 charactersjwinship83, May 12, 2009

A - Pours black as black can be with a coffee/tan head which quickly vanishes leave tan bubbles around the edge of the glass. Nothing mind-blowing but looks good, nonetheless. 
S - Right off the bat, I get roasted coffee/expresso beans mixed with dark chocolate and a hint of alcohol. I could go on smelling this one for days but I think it's time to move on.
T - Nice dark chocolate notes up front along with some coffee grounds of some sort with a slight oak-alcohol kick on the end which warms me up a bit. A really nice sweet milk chocolate aftertaste. As it warmed & opened up in my glass, the hint of alcohol almost disappeared, amazing.
M - Medium in body, not too thin, no too thick for this one. Very smooth & creamy with a dry finish.
D - A very nice example of a RIS that is worth of its top 10 rating. Better then Dark Lord? Personally, I don't think so. 909 charactersSean9689, May 09, 2009

2008 vintage, 22 oz bomber thanks to Rhinos00 and Wetpaperbag. This is actually the one Rhinos00 sent me for bags's will be saved for a vertical one day. Thanks guys! This beer has been on my hit list for the longest time and it seems fitting for tonight. Hopefully it lives up to the hype and my expectations. Served up in my Terrapin snifter. 
A: Well it pours what so many people often call that used motor oil pour. It had that thick consistency on the look with a nice semi-glossy black in color. Fitting name calling this the Abyss as far as appearance goes for sure. A pretty vigorous pour got me almost half a finger of ginger bread colored head. Sadly, said head did not stick around too long. Fizzled out to a thin ring and an oblong, bubbly elipse of a floater in the center. That ring does what it can to throw up some lace but the stick is not that great. All lace slowly oozes its way back down into the body. The culprit is probably the somewhat syrupy, clear film that easily sticks to the glass on each movement. I was expecting a bit more from this but I have to be realistic and give credit where credit is due. This is a fine looking RIS, but it has room for improvement for sure. 
S: The aroma is nice for sure. Getting a nice woody presence coming out. Some nice oakiness in here mixing nicely with the roased malts. Lots of vanilla extract type smell coming out and this might be a bit of a negative. That strong vanilla smell mixed with the alcohol makes an almost chemical like aroma that could have ruined this if it wasn't for everything else going on in here. That strange sweetness that can only be licorice is coming out. A big presence of molasses is forcing its way through. Roasted coffee rounds it out with a slight bitterness and more roast to mingle with that oak. There is a slight fruitiness coming in on the backend and its difficult to put my finger on but it may just be rum soaked raisin. Lovely with just a slight negative in that chemical type smell. I have been going back and forth on whether to give this a 4 or 4.5. I think I will lean higher because the other aromas do make up for that one negative smell. 
T: I am absolutely shocked and amazed that I didn't get any chocolate type aromas out of this when I get hit with a big time fudge presence on the first sip. I mean a serious, rich, milk chocolatey goodness. This works well because that is quickly chased by some deeply roasted, espresso coffee qualities that are complimented with a nutty type flavor (could it be hazelnut, my favorite?). Then you can taste that oaky character sliding in, mixing and bringing a touch of wood and vanilla in here. Sadly not getting much of the licorice in the flavor though. Molasses and brown sugar leave some sweetness behind. There is a touch of alcohol coming across that could absolutely use some age to thin out a bit. All in all, this works beautifully. 
M: Full bodied with a really nice thickness and almost syrupy quality at times. This is thick. It sticks easily to the palate and it is chewy to keep in moving down the throat. It is as if you might need a second swallow for each sip. Still it remains silky in texture. Carbonation is light, as it should be, allowing this to be thick and a sipper. ABV is much lighter in presence as you would expect from an 11% brew. Aftertaste is all fudge and coffee. Those flavors are great and should be the ones that linger, leaving you wanting more.
D: I am not going to lie, this beer is dangerously close to being too sweet of a brew. But . . . it works incredibly. I have to constantly compose myself, keeping me from gulping and slurping. It is dangerously easy to pound. Flavors are great and so are the aromas. I am glad that you get some things in the aroma that you don't get in the taste and vice versa, but that shows this beer has more growing to do and has more hidden within. Leaves you optimistic to what this beer can offer with some time. That slight chemical smell is probably the only negative I can find, but I imagine with the alcohol fading, it too will with time. This is a fantastic brew and i look forward to aging the other I have. This can only get better. 4,187 characterseveretends, May 07, 2009
4.78/5  rDev +6.7%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Although I could fill the page talking about the depths and magnitude of the beer, but I'll try to keep it short, as so much as already been said.
This is my 3rd time to try this, and is my favourite Imp Stout I've ever had. Not too much licorice. Wood is still very present (and contributes noticeable vanilla), but is not harsh. It's been in bottles now for about 5 months and is pretty damn drinkable for 11%, although there is a slight alcohol presence (warmth, taste). This is about as full flavored as it gets. Lots of dark chocolate. Not too sweet and I really like the addition of licorice here.
This is very thick and feels great. I did not hesitate to give Appearance, Taste, and Mouthfeel perfect ("exceptional") scores. This is truely an exceptional brew that I was tempted to give a full "5" across the board.
I don't think I'll have much trouble finishing the bomber, although it's prolly recommended to share with a good friend.
I'd love to try it at 1 and 1.5 years after bottling for super smoothness, without loosing too much roastiness and bitterness.
Musical accompaniment: Holy Fuck LP (A recommended pairing. I thought about breaking out some dark chocolate and licorice, but decided I wanted nothing but Abyss on my palate).
Not really any complaints here. If it were available here, I'd go for the case discount. 1,342 charactersMEsquandoles, May 02, 2009

A= pours a viscous black with a small one finger head that is brown. The beer is pitch black with no light coming through at all not even the sides. Great lacing is left on the glass.
S= Smells of deep chocolate and licorice. Some coffee and wood is in it with a touch of vanilla.
T= Huge wood flavor up front. Deep vanilla flavor but that is swallowed by huge chocolate malt and licorice. The licorice is very deep and magnified by the wood flavor. A little boozy in the finish as well but that's mostly taken away by the extreme chocolate malt and licorice. My only critique is that it is extremely sweet.
M= Chewy and smooth . Very dry finish.
D= Great beer. Not as amazing as I expected but still very very good beer. I'm impressed with the amount of flavor in it. The taste is a little hot though and the odor is a little low after hearing so much about how great the odor is. Very good beer though well deserving of praise but not as great as I have heard. 1,002 charactersjjanega08, May 01, 2009

G: Poured into an oversized brandy snifter.
A: Pours motor oil black. The head is a caramel-color with a bit of a crimson streak and plenty of bubbles. Excellent lacing. 
S: Plenty of dark espresso, ripening into a malty sweetness. I can definitely make out some of the brewer's licorice. Clear scent remains from the bourbon barrels, although I can only make out a bit of the oak.
T: In addition to everything from the nose, a bit of burnt chocolate, in addition to slightly-burnt coffee and roasted dark malt. 
M: Incredibly creamy with low carbonation. Very full-bodied. 
D: So smooth and complex; this is a good one to sip for quite a well. Nice addition to the great week I'm having celebrating my 25th birthday. So far, I've had Dark Lord and Pliny the Elder. We'll see how many top ten's I can fit into this week. 894 charactersThorpe429, Apr 28, 2009
4.77/5  rDev +6.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Finally came across this thanks to a generous soul at the Brick Store in Atlanta - 2007 vintage.
Pours completely black with a one-finger brown head that slowly recedes into a thin pancake on top leaving decent lacing.
Smells of roasted malts and chocolate with faint hints of coffee and licorice.
Tastes phenomenal - everything is in balance. Roasted malt and dark chocolate flavors up front give way to mild licorice and milder oaked bourbon flavors. The ending is bitter, with the roasted malt, chocolate, and coffee all contributing. This beer does a great job of not going too far with either sweet or roasted flavors, instead staying right in the middle.
Mouthfeel is very good. It's got a very nice thickness with soft carbonation that does just enough to make this go down smoothly.
Drinkability is great. Every sip seems to bring a new flavor and I finished my glass entirely too quickly. I could drink a lot of this.
Overall this lived up to the expectations. The Abyss is everything you could want in a big stout - definitely worth the hype. 1,058 charactersglid02, Apr 27, 2009

2008 batch.
Pours a thick opaque black. Even a light directly behind the glass can't coax a hint of color out of it. Head is a huge hands worth of milk chocolate froth. It falls slowly leaving sticky arches of lace.
Aroma is roasted, coffee, a bit of alcohol spiciness. Some sweet dark fruits, molasses in the back. I think there's a little oak here, but if the bottle didn't say it I wouldn't have picked it up...
Flavor starts darkly fruity, sweet. A hint of bitterness comes right before a strong coffee character. The oak is a bit more apparent here. A deep roasted note and solid bitterness own the finish but an alcoholic heat sneaks in as well.
This is a thick, perfectly smooth, chewy brew. Low carbonation in the mouth helps this silky feel.
I've get a little sick of all the RIS hype but this has put me in my place. This is a wonderful big, but still with some subtlties, brew. I have one I'm holding onto for a year... mmm. 1,049 charactersgoatgoat, Apr 26, 2009
4.76/5  rDev +6.2%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5My last beer before running the Boston marathon. I figured that if I'm going to run 26.2 miles, I mighnt as well have something tastey in my tummy.
Opaque black with a large, foamy, mud brown head. Sticky lace aplenty with thick foam retention.
Smells like molasses infused booze (in a good way) with an oaky bourban twang.
Tastes like milk chocolate, licorice, molasses, coffee (no coffee roast flavors, just coffee flavor), and mild dark fruit alcohol. Lingering oak aftertaste mixed with some chalky char. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy. 
Overall one of the best beers I've ever had. Has that hard to find comination of balanced complexity. 646 charactersdonkeyrunner, Apr 21, 2009

2008 Reserve.
A: Opaque as the darkest black imaginable. Great 4 cm condensed caramel head. Lacing is impressive, like sliding black butter.
S: Sweet chocolate, molasses, licorice, dirt, leather.
T: A really intimidating beer by its looks, but a lot of taste melds together in great ways. Almost like drinking a giant mellow fudge that runs into licorice, who knows bourbon, who turns out is friend with sweet molasses. After taste gives hint to the oak barrels, rather nice and dry with a settling sweetness. ABV is only apparent with my warm gut. Hype worthy.
M: Smooth as silk, can almost chew on it. Perfect.
D: Honestly it would be impossible to keep drinking bottle after bottle, you really would fall into an abyss. A pure blackout, time travel, and forget what time you went to sleep. It deserves to be savored. I am excited to get my hands on a few more bottles of this brew. 954 charactersMPLS, Apr 21, 2009

The taste is unbelievable. smooth, roasty, malty goodness. very complex, without being overwhelming. chocolate, espresso, dried fruit, faint hint of licorice. mmm...
Velvety smooth mouthfeel. creamy, but not thick. 
Wow...no complaints here. very complex without being overdone in any aspect. very drinkable, well hidden alcohol content. as close to perfection as i've ever had!

4.9/5  rDev +9.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5WOW. This beer truly lives up to the hype. Cracked a 2008 bottle, and wish I had a fridge full of them. Pours a near black, with a head that lasts the whole drink. The aroma is wonderful - some notes of espresso, and just faintly of bourbon. The taste is unreal. One thing I really appreciate is that it is not over-oaked, nor over bourboned. The alcohol is also very subtle. Perfectly balanced and carbonated, and the mouthfeel is very full bodied. I would say this is in my top 3 beers all-time, and one any stout drinker should actively seek out. 549 charactersDousedInStout, Apr 16, 2009

4.51/5  rDev +0.7%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 422-oz bomber poured into tulips. Thanks to colts9016 for this bottle.
A = Poured thick and extremely dark but not quite black. Formed a beautiful foam head with decent retention that was milk chocolate with orange highlights in color.
S & T = Sharp smells of treacle mixed with molasses, flavors track the smells. Lots of bitterness at the tip of the tongue that doesn't really let go until midway through the finish, but there are lots of complex flavors going on around that and some are very sweet like molasses and candied prunes, quite well balanced given how strong both the sweetness and the bitterness are, neither really overwhelms the other.
M = Heavy body, luscious feel and great mouthcoating, only marking it down slightly because between the carbonation and the alcohol it burns my tongue just a little too much to be a perfect mouthfeel.
D = Definitely is good enough that I cannot think of other similar stouts I would want to drink first. It is powerful though, so though an enjoyable experience, it is not something that just goes down without thinking about it. 1,084 charactersTraquairlover, Apr 12, 2009

5/5  rDev +11.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Once you crack the wax seal.... it's the REAL DEAL! 
A: As you pour this exceptional brew into a glass... the color is a dark, espresso like, thick and almost buttery texture. A pinky worth of head tops the glass, the lacing lathers the sides in a sort of sticky presence. The appearance is that of a Black and Tan. 
S: The aroma of this exquisite beer is that of coffee beans, brown sugar and figs. The aroma captures your senses and takes you on a flight of utter appeal. 
T: As soon as this beer touches your tongue, your taste buds are on orgasmic overload, with the molasses taste savoring every part of your mouth and covering it to the utmost perfection. 
M: Your mouth will salivate to the smell .... leaving you craving more of the smooth, warm, creamy feeling of buttery goodness. 
D: If you are anything like me and you don't like desserts; this will change your mind. Abyss is dessert in a cup; a high class beer and as you drink the better it gets. I highly suggest you try this.

4.46/5  rDev -0.4%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5What an outstanding experience. Sipped the whole 22 oz bottle outside by my fire pit as the sun went down. A couple of hours very well spent.
Pours a dark, dense used motor oil black with a dark tan head. Head retention is great for an 11% ABV Beer. This beer could be used for a stout commercial, beautiful appearance in my pint glass. Thick tan lacing down the glass as well.
Smell was the only part of this beer that was not outstanding. Smell was mild and malty, more of a hint of alcohol than in the taste and a little vanilla. Taste was great. Complex, dark fruits, malt sweetness, vanilla, coffe and a little bitter at the end, probably the licorice more than strong hops. Mouthfeel was the best part of the experience, thick, rich, smooth (probably the molasses). 
All of the flavors blended seamlessly and the alcohol was very well hidden. Drinkability was very good as well. A slow sipper, not because of the alcohol or richness, it was just that each sip was such a satisfying experience that it would have been counter-productive to rush the experience. One of the best beers I ever had. 1,102 charactersJayQue, Apr 05, 2009
5/5  rDev +11.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5There are times in one's life where you realize that you are in the presence of greatness. These moments are fleeting, and seem to come at the most unexpected of times. Such was the case with this beer. I walked into Marcellar's in Idaho Falls, Idaho (of all places) and they had this on nitro tap. If God drinks beer, he's got this on tap. I'm stoked to be the first reviewer to have had it on nitro. 
Everything about this beer is sublime. I would give it straight tens, if that were an option. It was absolutely beautiful in the Chimay goblet. The nitro gave it a totally smooth, 3/4 inch cappuccino head, but the beer itself was straight espresso beneath. "The Abyss" is a truly the perfect name for the appearance. 
The nose was subtle but sophisticated. Coffee, toffee, toasted nuts, and vanilla were all present. Not overwhelming, but very very pleasant.
The flavor was absolutely savory- the zenith of what this style should represent. Dark roasted coffee, toffee, toasted marshmallows, and sweet vanilla all surround very delicate herbals. The malt and the sweetness comes out strong (not too strong) in the beginning, but there's a powerful hop presence through the middle, and an especially bitter kick on the finish. This is everything you could ever expect from a beer, and more. 
I could imagine that this beer, in and unto itself, would have incredible body and mouthfeel. The nitro tap, however, is like adding an exponent to the feel of this sensory extravaganza. Absolutely amazing. 
Assuming I had enough of a supply, I could happily drink myself into oblivion with this utterly superb brew. Nitro is the way to go here. 1,644 charactersBeernoisseur, Mar 29, 2009

It poured jet black, huge tan head for a beer of this magnitude. I get sweet roasted malts and coffee in the nose. The taste made me have to sit down, I cant describe the details.

S - Smells amazing! Wonderful sweet woody bourbon aroma with hints of brown sugar and molases. 
T - First thing that hits you is a burnt oak punch which fades into a sweeter, smoother flavor that sticks to your mouth. Perfection!
M - A perfect amount of carbonation IMO. The finish leaves a warm, thin coating on your tougue that keeps the flavor with you between sips.

Shared this 2008 vintage with two non-BA friends at a homebrew session
A- Nice and dark with a lighter orange brown halo around the edges. Good size head and decent lacing
S- I got notes of oak, alcohol, nicely roasted malts and touches of the molasses
T- Very complex flavors going on here, I can see how it would age well and the booze would calm. Again with the oak and some bourbon
M- Thick and viscous the way it should be

S - Dark bittersweet chocolate, anise (hur hur), piquant black coffee, roasted malt.
T - Really unique flavor for a RIS. A lot of flavors collide up front; bittersweet chocolate, chocolate syrup, coffee beans, oaky bourbon vanilla essence, licorice, molasses.
M - Thick, viscous, full bodied, with a light, creamy, velvety feel. As I drink it, brown foam traces cling down the glass, one on top of the other, like a fat girl's neckrings. 567 charactersHeyItsChili, Mar 21, 2009

4.4/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 422 oz. Not quite a jet black pour with a dark brown and ruby hue head. Fades to a ring then pretty much sticks around. Aroma is heavy roast malt and coffee with anise and dark chocolate. Thick mouthfeel, a little rough, but not bad.
Flavor has lots of roasted malt and coffee up front. Some molasses, oakiness with just a hint of ripe dark fruits. Coats the throat nicely with oak, molasses and mocha espresso. A little bit hot and in your face at this point. A top notch imperial, but could use some aging. Top 5, I can think of 4 or so that I like better at this point, which means you can't get much better than this. I am glad I have 2 more of these.
A side note positive that can seperate this from some, is that it has reasonable availability. Way to go Deschutes. 770 charactersBung, Mar 16, 2009

Mildly viscous...definitely opaque. Licorice, spent motor oil, whatever ya wanna call it...this shit is fuckin' wicked DAAAHHHK...
I picked up some Vermont maple candy here off the top...makes sense from the label regarding molasses. A little licorice is in there too. Hops provide some raw green wood here-not pine, not grass...maybe something deeper...huge, copius malt has a good bourbon quotient but not obtrusive.
This has a little less sweetness than, say, Dark Lord (2008) but has a fortuitous heft...a little boozy heat, lots of XXX-roasted malt with a dry caramel sweetness, and a slightly austere hop package that resonates well with the licorice, charcoal and bourbon-snifter oak quality.
Although this has dry bites to it from the licorice, hop profile and a bit of booze, it gives off a great creaminess on the finish. A little more all over the place...may need some time.
Top notch and won't pass it up. Sure, it's a little young but there's a lot of craziness in this one. It's got an edge like a street gang, no doubt. But it's profound as hell and the creaminess is like the soothing tone of a mother settling her little hooligans down. One of the great ones. 1,319 charactersIBUnit63, Mar 12, 2009

22oz black wax top w/ the abyss written on it. 2008 vintage.
Pours out like motor oil into the glass, some seriously dark stuff. Nice big dark brown head sits atop that crude-like beer it protects. Smells of huge roasted malts, toffee, coffee, and dark fruits. A nice nose, but not amazing.
Taste is out of this world. So creamy, big chocolate burst with burnt malts, bitter coffee, sticky sweet molasses, slight alcohol warming but not too bad for 11. Rasisons, anise, and a tinge of pines are swimming around in my mouth somewhere right now. This reminds me of a belgian with how many different levels this is working on right now. One huge RIS, but the flavors balance everything together very well helping this beer become very smooth and drinkable.
As it warms up the chocolate flavors become more pronounced as does the anise and alcohol. Overall one of the best beers I've every tried. Really a great beer, will have many more of these I'm sure. 1,067 charactersabents, Mar 11, 2009

VINTAGE 2008
Review #200
This one pours a nice, deep, black. Just like it should be, with a name like The Abyss. Medium hard pour produces a two-finger head of dark cappucino colored foam. Retention is great and the lacing is excellent. Fully formed, solid and very sticky.
Nice. Big dark roasted barley maltiness. The oak comes through nicely, mixing with a hint of alcohol, giving a hint of bourbon-like qualities. Nice hint of dark molasses. Good dark coffee notes blend with hints of dark chocolate, bringing me back to cappucino comparisons. Light vanilla notes.
Huge presence of dark roasted malts. Big dark coffee profile. Nice vanilla sweetness, along with molasses, bringing balance. Nice presence of oak. A light touch of smokiness. Very mild notes of dark fruitiness. Hops are in there, but extremely well balanced with the rich maltiness.
Man, this tastes wonderful.
This is exceptionally smooth and creamy. Like silk across your pallette. The low level of carbonation sereves this brew very well.
Despite how big, thick and rich this one is, it is very drinkable. The beautiful level of balance make this one so enjoyable and easy to consume. The 11%ABV is so well blended into the mix, as to be hardly noticable. Just a slight warming effect.
This is exceptional.

4.38/5  rDev -2.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Embarassingly enough, it took my friends and I about 15 minutes to get the wax coating off the bottle. Well worth the effort.
Not a very thick head with an aggresive poor. Not much in the means of lacing either. Smell is a very malty tart. The roasted, smokey flavors of the imperial stout aren't that prevalent. I've definitely had more pungent aromas from stouts. The taste has a very tart malty flavor and a good bitterness. You can definitely taste the smokey dark chocolate flavors, but isn't that complex. I expected a bit more. I don't think it had the chocolate kick of Redhook's Double Black or Brooklyn's Black Ops. Nor did I think it had the complexity of Kate the Great. But it was very well-balanced and very simple - a rarity for the top beers in the world.
Overall, I think a delicious beer. It's spectacular in its simplicity. But I just don't think it's as bold as many other beers. So, definitely give it a try. It's completely worth finding one. But I might think this more because of the fact that its The Abyss, and not based on its taste. 1,062 characterszerofear13, Mar 02, 2009
4.4/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5This one poured out incredibly thick and black and dark. No light penetrates. Small tan head that dies down very quickly. Not much lacing. 
Very interesting smell. Light coffee notes, with definite fruity essence. Also a biting alcohol scent.
Taste is very complex. Good licorice taste, with hints of coffee and a small bit of bitter chocolate. The lingering taste is much darker and more of roasted malts than the first taste.
Mouthfeel is my favorite part about this beer. Extremely thick, almost heavy, with a very slow drinking pace. Interesting amount of carbonation for a beer this thick.
Again, can't give this one perfect scores for drinkability simply because I could never drink 5 of these in a row, but it deserves at least a 4.5 for being absolutely delicious. 776 characterstittymcj, Mar 01, 2009
4.7/5  rDev +4.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Big shouts to stubone for this in a recent trade. It's been staring at me all week and I can't resist her siren's song anymore she must be had tonight.
I chose my chimay goblet for this masterpiece of brewing. She pours pitch black with a nice thickness to it. A lovely head forms but then quickly fades away leaving its traces along the glass.
I could smell this thing as soon as I opened her. Big roasted barley aromas, dark chocolate, coffee, and hints of vanilla here and there.
She starts off kind of sweet, and chocolatey, then gets washed away by the bitterness of the roasted barley. As she warms a bit I'm beginning to notice the licorice and some of vanilla. The alcohol is starting to come through also.
Very smooth and creamy and too easy to drink for the abv. 772 charactersscifan, Mar 01, 2009

A - Poured into my New Belgium glass. Thick, frothy lacing left behind as this extremely dark brown, nearly black beer is swirled in my glass. Wonderful head retention for such a high ABV beer. Thin, light tan foam. Dangerous viscosity. 
S - Very complex nose includes alcohol, plum, and sweet milk chocolate. Also present is a licorice aroma. Low hints of charcoal. Earthy. Slightly burnt. 
T - More of the milk chocolate carrying through into the taste. Slight charcoal. Hop flavor is certainly present and in great balance. Hard to detect specific hops but the bitterness is rather high and in great proportion to the intense maltiness. There's this creamy taste, too. Burnt. Very dry finish. Toasty. 
M - Silky smooth, very full bodied. Moderate level of carbonation borders on moderate low. 
D - Taking time to enjoy this brew, the 11% certainly sneaks up on you. Deschutes has done a great job masking the force behind one hell of a malt backbone and a silky, creamy mouthfeel. For this style of beer, the drinkability is damn near perfect. 1,135 charactersBrewerB, Feb 28, 2009
4.76/5  rDev +6.2%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Got about 8 bottles in my cellar. Good thing because this beer is awesome.
Appearance is pitch black but a little less viscous looking than say KBS or DL. Beautiful tan head that provides nice lacing down the glass.
Smell is not that strong. I wish it was a little stronger but you smell some bourbon and toasted malts.
Taste is wonderful. Not too intense but so well balanced. The toasty malts and the slght bourbon taste with the smoothness of the oak. Very good.
Mouthfeel is perfect. Enough roast and carbonation and smoothness to make it very enjoyable.

Poured extremely thick and viscous with 3 fingers of dark-tan head. Completely unpenetrated by light. Some tracing on the glass and a few bubbles from carbonation
This beer has a complex but pleasant nose consisting of dark malts, coffee, licorice, and chocolate. 
Words fail to explain how enjoyable the flavor of this big stout is. Wood, dark malts, coffee and a little bitter chocolate up front, with a hint of hops to finish off. Alcohol flavors are subtle for an 11% abv beer, but increase as the beer warms up.

Unbelievably balanced and exceptionaly drinkable. I would love to see how this one ages. 735 charactersuser0317, Feb 26, 2009

A: poured a thick, motor oil like consistancy with a tan thick head.
S: Licorice, chocolate, bourbon, and a hint of coffee. I loved it, I could've smelled it all night
T: Got alot of the black licorice right away, then to a sweetness that was great, then a warm bourbon flavor lingered but not a hotness. It was a sweet bourbon flavor. GREAT!
M: Smooth and coating easy to sip on for along time.
D: I had to give it a 5 since I was really sad when I was to the last sip! I can't wait to try it a year or two. I have a couple more to sit on for a while. 570 charactersmadtowndmb1, Feb 26, 2009
4.7/5  rDev +4.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A- Pours black with no light coming through. A nice brown head forms up, has pretty good retention and then recedes to a thin layer of bubbles. 
S- Smells of roasted malts, coffee, chocolate, wood and bourbon. 
T- Very strongly flavored. All the flavors that were apparent in the nose come through. Along with just a hint of bourbon and wood.
M- Creamy and full bodied. Carbonation is low to medium.
D- Highly recommended and easy to drink. 444 charactersnrbw23, Feb 23, 2009
4.9/5  rDev +9.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a syrupy dark black, darkest beer i've ever seen. Nice tan head, bubbly with great lacing. Smells of syrupy molasses, a tad of oak, chocolate, roasty malt, coffee, very faint dark fruits. Tastes of roasty chocolate up front with faint dark fruits in the background. Then bold roasty malt shows its presense with some anise in the background. Finishes with a great roasty character, some coffee and oak. Alcohol is present, but not too blatant. Great mouthfeel, i was afraid of this beer being cloyingly sweet, but just unbelievable balance throughout. 
An unbelievable beer. There are so many flavors and aromas going on with this beer, just layers upon layers. That said, i didn't feel like it was too much at once, like many RIS's. The drinkability is very high for the style. The only thing stopping me from drinking multiples of this in one session is the alcohol. Balance is great in this beer. Too often, oak or any other additive will overwhelm the base flavor profile. But this beer is so well balanced with so many different flavors contributing. One of the best stouts i've ever had, i only wish my favorite brewery would deliver to the east coast. 1,165 charactersbum732, Feb 22, 2009
4.87/5  rDev +8.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.52008 bomber poured into a North Coast snifter.
A - Pours blacker than Dick Cheney's heart with a dark tan head that dissipates slowly into a thin layer of foam, leaving PLENTY of lacing.
S - Positively phenomenal and very well-balanced. Dark chocolate, anise, vanilla, roasted wood, and coffee all combine to create an extremely complex and enticing aroma that leaves your palate begging you to take that first sip.
T - Somewhat bitter up front, with dark chocolate and spicy wood notes dominating. A faint hint of piney hop bitterness comes through in the finish. As it warms, some sweetness starts to pop out, namely the anise and vanilla that were present in the aroma. The balance this creates is virtually indescribable. As it warms some more, some alcohol notes come out, but stay inconspicuous enough to stay out of the way and add even more complexity to this enormous brew. I was almost in tears when I finished this beer, in complete agony over the fact that it was all gone.
M - Full-bodied, creamy, rich, and deliciously smooth. Some alcohol warmth comes through after a while and it leaves an aftertaste of bittersweet chocolate and anise.
D - Immensely enjoyable and very smooth, though the alcohol definitely catches up to you by the time you finish it. It's also fairly heavy, making it hard to drink too much of it, as much as you'd love to. 1,363 characterspwsoldier, Feb 22, 2009
4.66/5  rDev +4%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5'08 Abyss tasted here.
Appearance: DARK brown head that creeps up from the Abyss... heeey. Dark as motor oil with an amazing looking lacing.
Smell: I can definitely smell the oak barrel that this one grew old in. Big presence of chocolate and dark cherries. Almost smells a bit nutty as well.
Taste: Burnt malts and molasses. Dark chocolate and nuts. SO GOOD!
Mouthfeel: So smooth! It's like drinking liquid silk. Slightly alcoholic aftertaste but the accompanying dryness really complements this.
Drinkability: It's like drinking a dessert wine only better! I could definitely drink a whole bottle of this to myself, despite how alcoholic it is. Love this beer. 667 characterslynx1245, Feb 21, 2009
4.34/5  rDev -3.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 3 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I thought I would never be able to try this beer, but thanks to Goodspeed94 and Mully I was able to get 3 bottles of this tasty brew. I Cracked one open after a wonderful cooked meal of lobster and Kobe sirloin and drank with coffee infused creme brulee. 
The appearance is jet black with a ml of thin tan head, remindes me of Darkness and Darklord, but just in looks.
Smell, really didnt do anything for me, this kind of threw me off, it smelled kind of like wet leather with a slight scent of bourbon.
Taste- wow the taste is amazing! it totally made up for the lack of aroma. sweet bourbon and smooth dark fruits dance on your tongue.
The mouth feel was like a silk blanket on your tongue. Thick but soft.
I dont know if I could drink another glass right away. it was a pretty heavy beer, but I cant wait to try it again! 829 charactersNuBrewm, Feb 18, 2009
4.63/5  rDev +3.3%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Wow. Another one of those that I just can't believe I popped the cap on. I'm long overdue for trying this.
2007 vintage
APPEARANCE: Pours into a Duvel tulip completely jet black with a tight, creamy mocha-colored head. It takes its good old time shrinking, eventually making it down to an almost full cap of foam covering the surface. Spider webs of lace cover all sides of my glass as I drink.
SMELL: Heavenly. Chocolate, caramel, and a licoricey fruitiness are all tied up with a tight little bow known as a bourbon barrel. Nothing is overwhelming. Nothing stands out too much. It's all perfectly balanced and blended together. Really nice.
TASTE: The moment of truth is... phenomenal. Quite a bit of roast along with chocolates at first. Then the bourbon really kicks in with hints of vanilla, but it stays nicely in the background. The finish adds a balancing bitterness - not that it really needed it - and seems to highlight some of the hops as well as bitter, roasty, black malts.
MOUTHFEEL: A medium-full, velvety smooth body is highlighted by a low and appropriate carbonation. Very nice, but couldn't it be thicker?
DRINKABILITY: Exceptional. No sign of alcohol anywhere, which is really dangerous. Plus it's nowhere close to sickly sweet. Instead it has a nice cutting bitterness that leaves you yearning for the next sip.
A world-class beer, absolutely. Everything seems so restrained and thought out, rather than packing it full of flavors with reckless abandon. It's hard to crack the top of the list of Russian Imperial Stouts, but I can't argue that this one doesn't deserve its place. A truly brilliant beer! 1,632 charactersjmalex, Feb 18, 2009
3.72/5  rDev -17%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.5Unfortunately the once grandeur beer known as The Abyss from the acclaimed Deschutes Brewery has officially departed from us. I continue to sit in complete bewilderment as to what happened with this year's release. I recall splitting the 2007 bomber with t0rin0 last year and being absolutely infatuated with it! To my recollection, I gave it something along the lines of a 4.75/5.0 in my personal journal - but that is assuredly not the case this time around for the 2008 version. Number 3 on the top 100 here on BA? Please... several Russian Imperial Stouts and even American Double Stouts instantly come to mind that can dropkick this one into pettiness. 
Appearance - Basically your humdrum pour and nothing terribly conceiving. The appearance didn't "wow" me, but to keep it civil I wasn't turned off by it either. To keep it simple, it was neutral. 
Smell - The smell could hold its own, I'll hand it that. My initial thoughts consisted of black licorice and coffee. The coffee was quite assertive, but to a coffee junkie such as myself it wasn't a bad thing! However, it seems as if they heightened the presence of the coffee in comparison to the 2007 version. The only downside to that was it indeed took away just a peedge of this brew's complexity that it once seemed to have. 
Taste- I was dissatisfied, it pains me to say! Where in the hell did the magnificence of The Abyss go? As a previous BA'er stated, this was not the becoming roasted malt taste that one would except in a Russian Imperial Stout - but rather a burnt charcoal demeanor that is unavoidable. Did it make me gag? No. Did it render any affection? Nope! Worth the $12/22 oz bottle - absolutely not Oprah!
Mouthfeel - Finally an aspect of The Abyss that was reminiscent of last year's, in addition to being an honorable kick to this brew! Deschutes has the mouth of this beer fulfilled. The Abyss has to be one of the most fluent beers to the palate out there! So creamy, rich, and smooth like silk. This was definitely the upside to my second sampling of the beer. 
Drinkability - The mouth unfortunately doesn't up the drinkability of this beer. The overall presence of burnt charcoal is what merely destroys the drinkability of The Abyss. It really is a shame, considering how last year's was so drinkable and left me wanting a whole bottle to savor on my own. 2,346 charactersazagthoth, Feb 17, 2009
4.25/5  rDev -5.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Thanks to thirdlap for the trade that provided this beer to me.
Bomber poured into a mug. '08 vintage served at around 55 degrees.
A - black. This is probably the darkest beer I have ever seen. A 2cm(-ish) tan colored head formed. It rather quickly dissipated into a slight film.
S - I'm first hit with a very rich chocolate aroma. alcohol, hops, oak, smoke, vanilla, licorice are to follow. The chocolate is the most present flavor and the more pleasant.
T - chocolate, espresso, roasted barley, with notes of oak, tobacco, smoke, and vanilla, which gives way to a spicy hop finish and a lingering bitter chocolate/cocoa taste. molasses are also present in the aftertaste. I don't taste the licorice that I smelled and know to be in here.
M - oily, greasy, syrupy, whatever you want to say. This beer is very viscous. It has a thick, undercarbonated mouthfeel (probably the age), but I think that the undercarbonation was perfect for how syrupy the beer seemed. This is definitely an exceptional mouthfeel for an RIS.
D - the alcohol is well hidden. The flavors aren't over the top. This beer is surprisingly drinkable. I definitely wish I had another in my cellar. 1,172 charactersbowersdm, Feb 16, 2009

A-Greasy, deep black with the most subtle hint of burnt sienna edgings. A thick deep tan head rises up, holds on strong until it reduces somewhat to a small cap. Head leaves nice streaky lacing.
S-Bold, intense and rich. A plethora of aromas swirl up from this one. Chocolate, espresso, bourbon, licorice, vanilla and a touch of spicy hops. This one is a joy to inhale. 
T-If the aroma lacks at all it is made up in the flavour profile. The complexity on the palate is truly impressive. A coffee liquor mixed with dark roasted malt feeling kicks things off. Notes bourbon, vanilla, licorice, blackstrap molasses, turbinado and even a bit of prune and fig thrown in for good measure, WOW! This brew was a bit hot when I had it about a month after the release but now with a full year of maturity, well it is an outstanding brew for sure.
M-Medium-heavy body with a rich, luscious and viscous feel. Some oily slickness but this simply adds to the enjoyment level. The myriad of flavours last throughout.
D-Smooth, rich and oh so enjoyable. I would be hard pressed to find a widely released, read no special one-day event thing, RIS that was as complex, drinkable and enjoyable as this. Do yourself a favor and fall into the Abyss, you will be glad you did! 1,370 charactersDeuane, Feb 14, 2009
4.21/5  rDev -6%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.5Pours jet black with a thick mocha head. Opaque-- no light penetrates. A black effin' hole.
Smells like bourbon... Acrid coffee, chocolate, hops...
Up front tastes like sweet malt which is quickly killed by bourbon. The bourbon taste melts seamlessly into an acrid coffee taste before finally being washed out with hops... Not at all like I expected. A very bitter cacao taste underlies the coffee and bourbon.
A thick creamy mouthfeel fills the mouth and rides over the tongue. A light light light carbonation only adds to the feel.
This is definitely a sipper. And at 11%, this is an end-of-the night beer. 612 charactersKlgkenny, Feb 13, 2009
4.57/5  rDev +2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.52008 vintage. Hot damn, I love twitter! Got a 'tweet' on 2/5 saying a surprise keg of Abyss just showed up at the Portland pub. Good excuse for:
a) reviewing the beer on tap (reviewed the bottled version before).
b) a liquid lunch.
Served in a snifter, the Abyss is a great looking beer. Dark as hell, sludgy 2-finger dark tan head that refuses to go away, legs and laces all the way til the end.
Although it's still quite young, this beer is incredible. Everything seems to be in perfect balance, and the nose and mouth meld together seamlessly. It's smooth, it's chocolatey, it's fruity, it's boozy. There's vanilla, wood, molasses with a touch of coffee and a touch of hops. A rich and dry roasted character. Perfect combination of assertive and subtle. A little hot, but then again, it's probably not going to hit its peak for a long time- this stuff is made to be aged. Glad I've got a few bottles to hang onto. 
Drinkability is off the charts for such a strong beer. I killed 2 10-oz snifters with ease and would do it again anytime. A small complaint is that the carbonation was perhaps a notch too strong, and the mouthfeel wasn't quite as smooth and velvety as I enjoyed in the bottled version. 
Overall impression: Outrageously good beer. Even fresh, it dominates most other big stouts. Can't wait to see how this bad boy ages. 1,341 charactersPDXHops, Feb 12, 2009

I know I won't have anything new to add, but I can't miss the chance to finally write a review on this stout of stouts!
Looks black as the black-top pavement out in the driveway. Has a foamy tan dead that doesn't stay for long,but sure leaves a nice lace! Smell is just pure heaven, lots of everything sweet. I swear I can even make out some anise. Taste is so balanced. This year's seems less "hot" on the alcohol than I remember last year's being. 
Overall: this stout is the nectar of the Russian czars. It just oozes all the goodness that you expect from the style. Its hard to go back once you stare into the abyss...other stouts just don't hold a candle! 675 charactersironlung, Feb 10, 2009
4.73/5  rDev +5.6%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Really everything that you have heard.
On tap at the Portland Pub.
Dark, inky pour with a great one inch head in a snifter. Excellent lacing. Deep sensory aroma with lots going on. The taste is sublime. Excellent mouthfeel with multiple arenas of flavor. Even better once it warmed up a bit. A bit too rich to have more than 10oz (the snifter pour) at a time, but the bomber might be worthy of sharing as an alternative to port after a big steak dinner. 455 characterspdxwhisky, Feb 10, 2009
3.76/5  rDev -16.1%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3 |  overall: 4This one is beautiful. It's pitch black and shiny, with a giant brown head, leaving great lacing and retention. The smell has a good bit of roasted sweetness, brown sugar, black patent, roasted barley. And there's even a note of spiciness with the alcohol. The taste is nice. There's a bit of sharpness initially from the alcohol and black malts. There's actually a funny sweetness mixed in with a bit of dryness. Buried down deep is a nice chocolatey flavor, with a deep brown sugar taste. I'd say this one could be overpowered by black patent if it weren't for the barrel-aging and licorice, and this is my main complaint with the flavor. I think there's too much to hide behind, which makes for an easier to accept beer, but I'm afraid of what lies behind. The mouthfeel is less than stellar for a BA beer. There's a bit of prickly carbonation, and it even tastes kind of thin, there's lots of flavor, but they aren't enrirely complete. There is a note of creaminess, once you work your way into it and the carbonation subsides. This one continued to pull me back in, though. I really enjoyed drinking it, and the recommendation goes without saying thanks to its spot in the top 100. 1,186 characterstaylorhamrick, Feb 10, 2009
3.7/5  rDev -17.4%look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Appearance: Poured into a snifter with 1cm dark tan head, dissipated quickly leaving no lacing. The beer is black, letting no light through. Very typical for a RIS, but the head retention was not what I expected. 
Smell: Very strong malty smell, some chocolate notes, with hints of sweet caramel. Again, pretty typical. 
Taste: Large roasty malt flavor, with some chocolate taste. Slight note of caramel sweetness, very small hint of oak. As it warmed it began to taste more smokey, and a sharp unfavorable bitterness was left in my mouth. 
Mouthfeel: Good body for a RIS, pretty smooth and creamy feeling, low carbonation. 
Overall: Easy to drink for a RIS despite the thick mouthfeel. To me this beer is really predictable. I was hoping for more of a woody/nutty flavor but just didn't find it. 800 charactersnatasharai, Feb 08, 2009
4.43/5  rDev -1.1%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Pours a deep dark black color with a thick 1-2 finger brown head that retains very nicely and leaves moderate amounts of lacing.
Strong aroma of coffee and chocolate hits immediately with hints of alcohol in the background. Very inviting.
Many complexities come through in the taste. Coffee, caramel, vanilla all show up in the beginning. Added notes of dark chocolate, fig, and molasses also show up. Finishes with oak and licorice. An amazing blend of flavors which helps to mask the alcohol just a little.
Exceptionally silky and smooth, this is easy to get lost in. The alcohol doesn't feel like 11% but keep enjoying this and eventually you'll learn the hard way. Beyond that, this here is a classic and definitely lives up to the hype. 744 charactersVengeance526, Feb 08, 2009

2007 Release from kind BA unknown. 
Poured this one freely into a 12 oz sniffer. It looked quite nice in the glass with and inch of mocha colored head atop of ebony brew. Dense foam that had staying power. A fair amount of lacing as well. 
The aroma was comforting. Chocolate covered espresso beans. Like walking into a cafe that makes fresh deserts. Just a hint of booze in the back. 
Lots of flavors, yet not muddled. Coffee, chocolate, molasses (hints of KC BBQ) and vanilla bean. A bunch of other stuff that is eluding me. I'm intrigued at this yet impressed that it was pulled of with such success. Could have got a 5 for taste except for an ever so slight bitter/harsh finish. 
Mouthfeel was full not chewy. Slightly slick. The only negative I can muster is just a little too boozy even after a year. Otherwise this is en exceptional beer. 949 charactersampzilla, Feb 07, 2009

One thing I must praise FO: every beer you order will be served at the optimal conditions, everytime. For a beer of this caliber that is incredibly important. 
A fluff of cappuccino head cascades over the thick, dark, viscous liquid as the bartender slides it my way. Glorious - so dark you could smuggle something inside it with nary a suspicion. The cappuccino aspect carries over into the aroma. The bourbon barrel scent comes through as does dark chocolate.
First sip is full of flavor and incredibly creamy. Oak and bourbon with the coffee bitterness shine in the flavor. Not a powerful bitterness, but the acidity your mouth gets from the first sip of joe in the morning. Lotsa coffee flavor too and a condensed milk sweetness too.
What you have his in a fantastic beer, worthy of all the accolades. Worth hunting for. 881 characterssloejams, Feb 03, 2009

Poured from a bottle into a flute. It pours like motor oil with a black appearance and opaque when held to the light. A 1.5 inch mocha colored head forms that slowly reduced to a healthy lacing.
The aroma was subtle with some very mild hoppy hints, as well as dark chocolate. A mild level of malty sweetness was noted. Some bourbon and coffee notes are present.
The taste was fairly complex including a bittersweet, dark chocolate combination with coffee. There was also a metallic component to me, which several people couldn't quite put there fingers on. Mild bourbon is present.
The Mouthfeel revealed a full body with moderate level of carbonation for a stout. It was quite thick and had a dry finish. Something about the feel didn't quite warrant a 5. 
Overall, I think this is good for the style but was surprised that it ranked higher than Dark Lord. Overall, it is a very good beer and I will take any opportunity to have another. 1,036 charactersSykDoc, Feb 02, 2009

4.43/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 3.5Dark black beer in the snifter glass with a mocha head that clings around the edges but doesn't keep for very long. Pouring this beer is a very pretty sight as it has a nice redish black color as it comes out of the bottle before it hits the glass.
The bourbon barrel aroma is apperent in the nose. I also noticed some dark chocolate aromas, and a bit of booziness. All the "dark" aromas are here. Not a lot of strength of the aroma and I wouldn't put it as one of the highlights of the beer.
Taste is excellent. I may have had or will have had better tasting imperial stouts but this is clearly something special. A nice chocolate sweetness is on the front of the tongue, and the bourbon hits somewhere in the middle. I don't love the taste of bourbon, and I don't go crazy over beers that are bourbon aged, but this is done just right in a way that adds to the beer.
Mouthfeel is a highlight of this brew. Very smooth, from fridge temp to nearly room temp. Great lingering aftertaste that is perfect for a sipper. I had a good time sipping on this beer. There is a bit of a burn on it and towards the end of the 22oz it becomes a very slow sipper. 
Aging notes from "Black Friday" stout tasting 2009, 2007-2009 vintages:
The aroma changes in this beer considerably, with the two year old bottle (2007) smelling the best. With time, this beer looses some hops but never completley, and the chocolate aroma just gets better every year. After one year (2008), the chocolate mends with barrel and hop aromas to create an interesting balance. After two years (2007), this aroma is like a chocolate cake with chocolate frosting. That balance is just gone and this is pure fudgy chocolate. There is also a great, ale like dark fruitiness that isn't found in the other bottles.
The flavor swings in balance in a similar way the aroma does. The barell flavors fade, making this a better beer if your not a fan of bourbon. I think the barell flavors are actually most noticeable after one year, and then fade away after two. The chocolate flavors get better, and the bitterness from both the hops and roast get softer. The licorice flavor adds a nice dimension, and is more noticeable with time because of the overall softening of harsh flavors. The mouthfeel seems to thin out in the 2007 bottle.
Excellent beer for aging. I took extensive notes on this beer and its changes, so these are just the highlights. These bottles were aged incredibly well and didn't pick up a hint of oxidation or negative aging effects. 2,515 charactersjeffthecheff, Jan 30, 2009

The mouthfeel is a creamy goodness, a warm toffee,coffee chocolate goodness. Hard to think this could get better. oh wait, there is a bit of alcohol that might mellow.

A- Clear black with velvety khaki head. Suds like lacing on the snifter. (Never been into stouts, should they lace like my standby IPA?)
S- Rich dark coffee beans, some chocolate, and some black licorice. Unlike anything I'm use to smelling. Remember, I'm and IPA guy. 
T- Like a coffee/chocolate milkshake. Also taste some bourbon, black licorice, and maybe nutmeg?? Amazing. Being as Guiness has been my only stout (and it's an Irish stout) that I've ever given a chance, I'm mind blown. I've now got the balls to try others! Coats the mouth well and leaves a thick residue on the tongue. 
M- Thick, thick, delicious. I'm outside of my comfort zone and I love it. 
D- Easy to drink, but will only be drinking one. Damn it, I said that after Hopsickle. I wish I had more of these. Definitely going on my wants. I think I'm gonna be giving more stouts a try! WOW! 1,066 characterstadowdaddy, Jan 26, 2009

2007 Vintage
A: a gorgeous black body that portends the lovely taste this beer has. it has an almost brown inky appearance. The head is a dark mahogany that pours rather thick and pretty robust. it starts out sticking rather profusely but falls off as it sits. this is the only knock but at 11% this is rather impressive.
S: The aroma is good but not overwhelming. or strong enough to make a significant impact. there is an initial boozy bourbon barrel aroma and a slight bit of coffee but the aroma is not long lasting
T: amazingly smooth there is a vanilla note with a chocolate back bone and an obviousness that this was aged in barrels but not in an overwhelming. The molasses is evident in the finish and i feel helps with the smoothness. this is such a good beer
this is a fantastic beer extremely smooth and easy to drink, at 11% are you kidding this is extremely good yum 928 charactersRedwood21, Jan 26, 2009

2007 vintage Bottle poured into a snifter produced a large coco colored head that settled to a thick lace and trailed of to a nice ring as I waited. As black as black can be colored bodied ale no light coming through this at all 
Aromas of coffee, anise and some nice roastiness waft off the glass. I get some of the wood earthiness as well coming up as it warms. The longer I hold this I can say it's a really nice complex aroma.
The Flavors of molasses is very evident it helps tame out the roastiness of the malts this is so much better as it warms much more of the complexity of this stout comes thru. Thick in the mouth with just a slight amount of carbonation 
Ok I'll give you that this is defiantly on par with Kate in it complexity although two different animals when it comes to flavors that present themselves. This is a wonderful Ale and deserving of a place in one of the best out there. Yes I will drink more of this and would seek it out 1,014 charactersjoepais, Jan 25, 2009
4.4/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Pours opaque black with brown head. Nose is among the best I've experienced - heavy chocolate, nougat, and a suggestion of German black forrest raspberry chocolate cake. Palate is silky smooth, more roasty chocolate, and a finish that carries into lighter milk chocolate with little presence of alcohol. A world class dessert beer. 331 charactersyemenmocha, Jan 24, 2009

I had the pleasure of trying this ON TAP at Father's Office in Culver City, CA. I couldn't believe it was on their menu. The guy at the counter realized that I was in for a treat, apparently not a lot of people order this one, I couldn't believe it. The appearance is like nothing I've ever seen before. Someone before described it perfectly - khaki head. But, in addition to this, it looks like Turkish coffee, and like the Turkish libation, I'm conviced that if you drink enough of this, you'll see the future. The taste was unbelievable - chocolate, coffee, dates, and...nectar of the Gods, basically. Smell was your typical stout smell - molasses and coffee beans. Drinkability is down only because of the thickness and the abv, but the taste and appearance all make up for it. This is one I will seek out whenever the cold winds blow, and I need a truly imperial stout. 954 charactersraoulduke37, Jan 24, 2009
4.7/5  rDev +4.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Opened this bottle after the Giants lost to the Eagles in the first round of the playoffs. A perfect choice, it turns out, because not only was it a hugely pleasant surprise but the color and smell fit my mood very well.
I poured it into a pint glass, and frankly it looked close to syrupy. Someone described the head as khaki, which I think is a great description, but the beer itself was black and strong-looking.
The smell was great too though, and it had all the elements of an imperial stout that I enjoy: coffee, chocolate, molasses, brutality, and there's bourbon as well. Tasty.
As far as the taste goes, it's a very complex mix of oakiness, stoutness, licorice, sweetness, bitterness, and then all the other stuff I mentioned before. I couldn't even take it through step by step because there's always a little something that's more emphasized or subtle on each sip. The oak really comes through though, and makes it really accessible in the midst of all the darkness.
The Abyss is awesome, and I wish I could get it around here. I don't know when the next chance I'll get to have it will be, but whenever I find it I will get as much as I can. 1,157 charactersrasta16ry, Jan 23, 2009

4.26/5  rDev -4.9%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.52007 Vintage Bottle
released January of 2008 
consumed in January of 2009
Appearance: Double wax covered bomber poured into a pint glass. Sexy black color with crushed red velvet corners. An oily sheen glazes over a brown mocha crown with mahogany highlights. Nice! Fair amount of head retention, quite rocky, some lacing.
Smell: black licorice, a small coffee tinge, molasses, and a touch of alcohol melded into a smooth yet complex nose. A touch faded with the year of cellaring on it so I'm giving it a 4.0 instead of a 4.5
Taste: Still some bourbon zing up front after the year of aging. Its a shame that the bourbon zing has an astringent quality. A nutty bridge comes next and then it finishes with a a bitterness normally associated with coffee. I might have caught this one at a transition period because the flavors seem to lack the strength and boldness of a fresh bottle, yet they fail to be completely fused as I was hoping for.
Mouthfeel: Lots of carbonation help this high ABV full bodied Imperial Stout. A touch thick but not to the point where I'd use the word syrupy. Very nicely done.
Drinkability: The mouthfeel really helps boost the drinkability of this 11% brew. 1,189 characterskoopa, Jan 21, 2009
4.7/5  rDev +4.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Appearance: Dark brown to black. Certainly no light shining through the glass. The head is as from a fine mocha, frothy and tan. It sticks around for a while leaving some lacing.
Aroma: Dark chocolate, espresso, molasses roasted malts and some dark fruits all well balanced with the oak. Very enticing! I can hardly keep myself from taking the first sip so I can jot down these notes.
Mouthfeel: Full bodied to thick in the mouth, but also velvety smooth. The carbonation is note perfect.
Taste: Roasted malts mix with the chocolate and espresso up front. There is slight bitterness that is well-balanced with some mild sweetness. The molasses and dark fruits settle in next, but through it all there is a nice subtle oakiness. Everything is there and identifiable but they blend to create a complexity that is difficult to describe. The alcohol is present, but not overpowering. In fact, this could be dangerous. 
Overall impression: Wow! what an outstanding stout. The complexity is astounding, but the balance is really what stands out. You can taste everything but no one element dominates. One of - if not THE - best examples of the style! 1,148 charactersjkendrick, Jan 21, 2009
4.85/5  rDev +8.3%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.522 oz bomber with a black wax-dipped top. Poured into a snifter. Pours with a very small dark brown head. The name of the beer is appropriate, as it's black as night.
Aroma is of roasted malt with a hint of underlying licorice. Taste is similar to the smell, but it strikes an awesome balance between caramel/licorice sweetness and roasted/coffee bitterness. Despite the huge ABV, there is only a bit of alcohol warmth.
Mouthfeel is very thick and the beer has an extremely long coffee-like finish. Drinkability is about as good as it gets for a high ABV RIS. Probably my favorite RIS so far, and I really wish it was more readily available. 643 charactersdaythree16, Jan 19, 2009
4.63/5  rDev +3.3%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Had on tap at Deschutes on release night in PDX, and in bottles several times since.
Observables: Deep black, very small tan head, smell has molasses, roasty malts, and alcohol.
Taste: At first I am stunned by how well the chocolate, coffee, and licorice fuse, which is followed with a subtle hotness. The complexity and depth of the flavor are other-worldly. 
Overall: The best RIS I have ever had, period. A life and palate changing "oh my god this is good" beer. Very much deserving of the hype and high ratings.
EDIT: I've had the 06, 07, 08, and 09. But this was finally unseated by BA Speedway as the best stout on the planet. 636 characterssquaremile, Jan 19, 2009

Reviewed from notes.
A: Completely black, with a foamy dark tan head, and immense lacing. The lacing is huge, and coats the glass in chunks as you drink it.
S: On the fresh side, lots of sweet malt, aromas of vanilla and molasses, with a hint of alcohol near the end. Very, very good.
T: Strong, tons of booze, oak, and anise, very different than the smell, but still very tasty.
M: Super thick, perfect except just a little too flat.
D: Decent, but too strong. I'd love to see what a year would do to mellow it out. 553 charactersBMoney575, Jan 18, 2009

A: Deep and dark. To be greeted with this, was worth the walk. Thick tan head and tons of lacing all the way down.
S: Roasted malts (chocolate malt), some coffee and cocoa. All the smell that goes along with this style.
T: I taste coffee in this a bit more than I smelled it. The flavors I smelled along with some oak and smoke, blended quite well. I taste some smoke in this one too. This is definitely complex. 
M: Smooth, not creamy. Reminds me of Nogne O.
D: Although this is not too creamy, it is very complex which leads me to drink it slowly. 
Overall, find me another. 683 charactersSplunny, Jan 18, 2009

A- Deep deep black. One of the deepest blacks I have ever seen in a beer. The head is brown with great retention that always has a layer over the surface. Looks absolutely stunning.
S- Chocolate milk, some cocoa, anise, some coffee, molasses, toffee... The alcohol is barely apparent for how fresh this is and for how high the ABV is. Stunning.
T- Very strongly flavored, it took my palate a bit to adjust to it. All the flavors that were apparent in the nose come through in the flavor along with just a hint of bourbon and oak. As it warms, a bit of nuttiness comes out and the sweetness becomes accentuated. Exceedingly complex. Maybe a bit fresh, but this is wonderful.
M- Creamy smooth, like chocolate milk. The alcohol makes it a bit harsh on the tail end.
D- A bit on the strong side; a bit boozy. This beer is outstanding, but maybe requires a bit more time to fully settle down. I am blown away. 921 charactersgordavidson, Jan 17, 2009
4.05/5  rDev -9.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Thank you skourtis for the opportunity!
Pours a deep black with a nice mocha foam that leaves a full crown with no bald spots.
Smells lightly of chocolate and sweet malts. Is it possible to smell creamy?
Taste starts off a bit underwhelming but worth it for the finish. Chocolate, licorice, coffee, all present. I can't help but say this almost tastes like a belgian in how well it is put together.
Mouth is great, med/thick body and low/med carbonation.
I think that while this beer is good, it probably is just a tad overrated due to it's rarity. 553 characterssonicdescent, Jan 16, 2009

S - It smelled surprisingly fruity, like a Belgian ale. Also, sweet chocolate notes with hints of licorice.
T - It tasted of tons of chocolate and sweet caramel. Some licorice and coffee flavors emerge, too, along with the fruity flavors.
M - It was smooth and very soft. A medium to full-bodied beer.
D - This is a great RIS and quite drinkable despite the high ABV. Really a great brew. 540 characterszeff80, Jan 16, 2009
4.38/5  rDev -2.2%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4This is one of my favorites, but I'm going to try and be as objective as possible. Despite this being probably my thirtieth Abyss, I'm treating it as though it's some new RIS from some unheard of startup brewery.
This one pours incredibly dark, with a corresponding inch-high dark tan head. The head is suprisingly resilient, receding to perhaps 1/8th of its original height, but staying nonetheless.
The nose is dark chocolate, cream, coffee, and a hint of bourbon. Very promising.
Wow. The first thing I get is smoky oak, molasses, and THICK. That chocolate proves to be bitter dark, and the coffee nose works itself into a tannic acidity aftertaste that sticks around long after the swallow. Bourbon is present but certainly not overpowering. This is such a 'complete' example of the style; I'm left looking for nothing after each sip.
Carbonation is light to medium, body is incredibly thick, and it sits on your tongue with a sensation that is more silky than creamy. 
I'm inclined to call drinkability relatively low, but having downed a 34oz pour at a local pub with relative ease... well, it's just that good. I'm left wanting more after finishing off a bomber.
An awesome beer. One of the top five imperial stouts I've ever had. 1,243 charactersThirdLap, Jan 15, 2009

A - Poured a deep, dark brown - bordering black - body with a slim burnt tan head that diminished and left a bit of spotty lacing around the glass.
S - Initial whiff reveals an odd, yet intoxicating blend of chocolate milkshake and beef jerky. Hmmmm... interesting, to say the least. Oak and woody notes also emerge, followed by a touch of alcohol and a subtle earthy hop character. 
T - This RIS opens with the flavor of sweet milk chocolate paired with a mild meaty, beef jerky character. Suggestions of molasses and licorice emerge in the middle and mingle with more earthy, woody notes and some dark roasted maltiness. Finishes with an earthy hop bitterness. 
M - Medium bodied with a silky, smooth texture and soft carbonation. No noticeable alcohol presence for such a huge RIS! Finishes with a moderate earthy bitterness on the palate.
D - Wow! This is an impressive RIS for sure. This drinks like a champ for such a hefty alcohol presence. At 11% ABV, this is about as drinkable as you can get for a RIS, especially one that is as complex as this. 1,130 charactersffejherb, Jan 11, 2009
4.8/5  rDev +7.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Well well well. My review for probably the best beer I have ever consumed. 
The appearance is that of syrup. Pours incredibly dark, and when it pours the aroma just explodes into the air rushing your senses like a herd of bulls. I poured the head to three fingers height just to get the oxygen flowing and the aroma all over the room. The head is a caramel color that, for me, came down to about a finger height. You can hold a spotlight up to this beer and nothing will penetrate through. 
Like I said previously the smell is so smeet and intoxifying that you just want to bathe in the brew. I can smell black licorice, caramel, and the alcohol. I just want to breath it all day long, I want the smell to be in my nose forever. 
The taste is so complex that I might not even be able to describe the taste. Its like sucking off the tit of the Virgin Mary, how about that? It dances on the tongue, telling your body that you are unworthy of this nector from the God's. Sometimes I can taste the licorice and its the most overwhelming characteristic of the beer, and sometimes it is the caramel and chocolate flavors with an alcohol aftertaste. Every time it is so different. Every time I fell bad that I am drinking it because I feel like it might be the cure to cancer. 
The mouthfeel is really enjoyable because the beer does this really nice dance on your palate before foaming up into this great chocolate alcoholic taste that just washes down so sweetly that you want to just weep. I love this beer for the fact that it just tastes like the best Russian Imperial Stout that has ever existed. 
The first time I had this was back in the beginning of the holiday season and I just remember having this smile plastered to my face. You drink one and its so filling and satisfying that you want another. I had two the first time I had it and it was just a little too much of a good thing. I was overwhelmed. 
Whenever, if ever again, I see this beer in the store I will sell my car to get more of these. Currently sitting with ten but I do know of a place that has more. At twelve dollars a bottle it is an expensive drink but oh oh so worth it.

2008 vintage:
poured black with a smooth viscosity and a dark tan head. Aroma of bittersweet bakers cocoa powder, slight to no coffee, vanilla, and burnt brown sugar. Taste parallels the aroma but with a very nice oak notes, vanialla hints, some molasses - no licorice. Excellent medium mouthfeel, that is slick yet dry - I could drink many of these but I am confident that time will lend complexity --- please! 497 charactersbrandoneast, Jan 09, 2009

A: Poured like a thinned chocolate syrup. Rich black/brown with coffee brown and over-frothed head. Tight lacing down the glass.
S: Strong bitter coffee with dark and a bit of milk chocolate aromas. Somewhat noticeable smokey/roasted malt characteristics.
T: Milk chocolate and dark bitter chocolate flavors, cold high-end coffee. Deliciously complex. 
M: Exquisitely smooth, rich and creamy. Slides down the hatch like rapidly-stirred chocolate milk. Silky deliciousness. 
D: I am so glad I waited a year with this one. I've had it fresh before and it is still phenomenal, but in a different way. This tasting wowed me above expectations. I didn't think The Abyss could get that much better. This makes me want to seek out additional vintage bottles. Future vertical tastings? I'm in. 857 charactersd0ggnate, Jan 09, 2009
5/5  rDev +11.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A: 2008. Whether for numerology, the occult, or mysticism I had to make this review number 111. Poured like motor oil and molasses with blackened chestnut coffee highlights. That is still giving it credit since it is darker than any description can do it justice. It's doom metal in a bottle. Perfectly formed powdered chocolate brown head with subtle amber tints. Sheets of lacing sticking down the glass. This destroys any sense of the holidays with its blackened and blasphemous colors. 
S: Scents are enticing. Dark fruits with slight hints of vanilla and coconut. Milk chocolate with roasted nuts, ginger, and a slight pine hops. Brown sugar coupled with cocoa crispness. Oaked grapefruit toasted with a sweet candies. Tempered ripe orange peel like hops. A bit of bourbon. The smell is sludge greatness like an Eyehategod or Grief album. But despite the ABV the alcohol is low key. Overall, a very massive nose with lots of complex aromas.
T: Both on tap and from the bottle I found the tastes to be pure and delicious perfection. Coffee and chocolate hit the tongue immediately and you know from the start this is going to plow every sense. Plums with a stout caramel richness. Malted and toffee roasted sweetness balanced against a sharp fruit tartness. Red wines and red cherries with a silky baked fudge finish. Black licorice with grapefruit spine. There are some slight darkened citrus hops in the backdrop but overall this is as blackened and charred as it looks. Alcohol is present and adds kick to each taste along with the spices.
M: Full body with a rich and creamy texturing. Silky and massive. Might as well be a solid since it ends up being so chewy.
D: Tried this from the bottle on Thanksgiving and New Year's Eve. Also, had a couple snifters on tap at Collins in Seattle. Quite frankly I could not get enough of this beer. With or without food this is an absolute treat and an absolute recommendation. If the 1974 movie Black Christmas had to be summarized into a beer then here it is. Don't go in the attic unless you're ready to be wrapped in plastic. This goes well with loud music or loving company. "Drugs; sex; every sort of filth. And you hate the police, don't you?" 2,201 characterserikm25, Jan 08, 2009

Pours a really black thick color with a beatiful brown foamy head that leaves some lacing behind.
Licorice, Molasses, vanilla, dark sugary chocolate
A little sweet upfront with a slight bourbon taste to it.Then its too much of a coffee bitterness which leaves you with a dry bitterness aftertaste.
I could not have more then one of these unlike Black Albert.
Overall I would say its nothing more then an average RIS, but it surely does not live up to the hype it gets 580 characterstr4nc3d, Jan 06, 2009
4.88/5  rDev +8.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 52007 vintage courtesy of akorsak... thanks so much, man!
Pours jet black, thick as motor oil. Excellent head builds up nicely, big and frothy with great lacing. A lot more carbonation than I would have expected. Looks and smells like alcoholic chocolate milk. 
Immensely complex palatefull of tastes from this. The finely roasted cocoa taste is there, that much is obvious. Probably because of the aging, I get a finer taste from this, also. I get tastes of licorice, and vanilla bean. Not sweet tastes, just hints of where this beer has been in the past. There's not much of a hard-liquor presence from the aging, its more of an oaky flavor. Again, it's not real direct at all, just a hint in the foundations, what seems to me a "lightening" from other Impy Stouts. Not a lightening of flavor, far from it, it just seems so airy for something so dense. A little bit of a hop presence, but no bitterness to speak of. Perfectly balanced. Nice and creamy, just sits on the palate, while being full-bodied and chewy at the same time. Incredible drinkability, I thought this would be a slow sipper, but I find myself drinking it faster than is probably good for me. I'll probably be burping up cocoa for the night, and that's a good thing. I hate giving out perfect marks, but across the board, this is so close. If I were someone who would make the other marks perfect if the taste is perfect, this would be a perfect 5 no questions asked. If you have the opportunity to try some, I suggest you do so! 
I don't know how much of the difference is due to aging. I've not had 08, but the 07 was very mellow, no alcohol heat behind it at all. Yet it still manages to pack all kinds of flavor in. A hotter version of this would probably lose half a points ranking for taste and drinkability, I would imagine. Now I wish I had some 08 to compare.
PostScript: I can't help but compare to Brooklyn BCS, I get so many of the same flavor profiles here. BCS is a little hoppier in the finish, and a little rougher on the initial drink. I can't help but wonder what happens when the BCS in my cellar gets a year on it. But Abyss is like an even awesomer version of BCS. 2,158 charactersdamienblack, Jan 06, 2009

Appearance: It is absolutely opaque with a beautiful small brown head and slight lacing. 
Smell: a little yeasty with thick chocolate malts, no alcohol in the nose which is a good thing for an 11% beer. Smells a bit like a heavy Belgian quad. 
Taste: Beautiful bitter cocoa and dark chocolate malts, a little burned dark coffee notes but not overwhelming. You can definitely pick up the licorice, but again it is not dominating. 
Mouthfeel: My only 5 for mouthfeel thus far - stays around a long time, hits big and feels heavy and thick, but somehow not too syrupy. 
Drinkability: Great for a beer of this style, no harshness or oddities whatsoever. 
Stoked I found this one. 813 charactersbenclimbs, Jan 06, 2009

Smelled ourbon hints filled with vanilla, oak, and a little bitter/dark chocolate. Also got hints of walnut.
Taste was remarkable. Abyss starts out sweet, mellow and delicious and finishes with a wonderful chocolate bitter that fades into a hoppy bitter. The finish and aftertaste are both very warm in a bourbon fashion, but I have to admit: this beer hides it's 11% ABV very well. Does not taste hot at all.
Abyss could feel a little thicker. Still, it's silky with a good level of carbonation. Also quite drinkable, except for the part where a couple bottles would probably put me right to sleep... that 11% takes a toll.
Shoutout to pjeagles for his generosity. He bought this all the way from NM to MA for me and my buddies to share. You, sir, are a beer hero. 893 charactersschroederm, Jan 05, 2009

Split this beer with Schroederm and Drnknmnky.
Endlessly black, light stands no chance of penetrating this black beauty. Dark rich head that had two separate layers from two separate pours.
Anise, hints of whiskey, and some subtle hop hues.
Roasted characteristics, both dark and milk chocolate. A friend pointed out that the citrus characteristic in the beer is blood orange. The finish is bitter initially a Belgian chocolate aftertaste followed by a hop bitterness that sits on the tongue. 
Great mouth feel, very creamy due to the fantastic head. The body is rich but could be a little thicker. 
I wish I could drink this beer more often. I will buy as much of this black beauty as I can get my hands on in the future. World Class. 827 charactersalovesupreme, Jan 05, 2009
4.6/5  rDev +2.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4'08 vintage on tap at Toronado in San Diego. Jet black in the glass with a beautiful mocha brown head that left a lace ring with every sip.
Smells like frickin chocolate milk. Dark cocoa, coffee, and sweet milk mingle with lighter notes of licorice, roasted grain, Kentucky bourbon, oak and vanilla bean. 
Silky smooth on the palate, almost like an oatmeal stout. Chocolate notes are bitter and sweet at the same time. Excellent espresso, vanilla and bourbon notes stnd out deliciously in the background. More carbonation than expected, which is a pleasant surprise.
By far the best stout I have ever had. Amazingly complex, delicious, and drinkable. I wanted to dip oreo cookies in it. 689 charactersRodBurg, Jan 05, 2009

pours a totally opaque black with a thick, frothy brown head. Heavy coffee nose, with chocolate and a bit of caramel. Taste is similar, with the chocolate flavors a bit more present, and a very mild bitterness at the end. Incredibly smooth.
2008 Vintage, reviewed 01-04-09
Similar to original tasting, but more oak and bourbon is noted than before. Solid oak presence on the palate, adding a touch of tannic astringency. Still rich, smooth and creamy. Top notch. 496 characters0110x011, Jan 05, 2009
4.87/5  rDev +8.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.52007 bottle that's been staring me down since i bought it and after enjoying this one i'm really glad that i still have a few bottles left.
Lets start on the bottle, first off i love the waxed dipped look it just tells you that there's no way it's been tampered with. Second i like the fact that the brew year is right there on the bottle and third i think that it's awesome that they dont change the label. there seems to be a lot of limited releases that change every year and while i love the art that some of the breweries put on the label, i also enjoy the simplicity of keeping it the same.
I don't have any sniffer glasses so i poured this into a Chimay goblet:
The Abyss pours out with a pitch black almost motor oil look to it. it's a dark dark beer that doesn't allow any light to penetrate it. There's a 1 finger mocha colored head. didn't really notice much lacing, but it's not expected
The smell is of chocolate, black licorice, molasses and some oak
The taste is about the same as the smell with bitter chocolate and oak aftertaste. The ABV is well masked here
mouthfeel is thick, this one takes a while to enjoy but the time is well worth it.
Drinkability is also amazing. although i dont think i could have more then a few before i'm feeling buzzed / drunk, after finishing it i really do want more.. 1,318 charactersSirChugsAlot, Jan 04, 2009

A. Dark black with no head pour. I mean this thing is solid in color and form. Syrupy but not in an over the top fashion. Bravo Deschutes!! 
S. Phenomenal, tons of coffee, vanilla caramel and sweet chocolate, with a sense of dryness. There is a lot of complexity in the nose, I like it.
T. Sweet bourbon, oak dryness, all smells mentioned above, bitter coffee all the way through al little rough on the mix of flavors but still great. Creamy and crunchy. I would categorize this along with Bell's Expedition Stout as being a bad boy of the style. Its not a smooth and user friendly drink. It kicks you in the mouth and really makes you dig deep into you palate to savor the greatness of this beer. 789 charactersCoolJosh, Jan 04, 2009
5/5  rDev +11.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I love this beer. By far the best beer I've ever had. I had a bottle of The Abyss from 2007 that I let age a year in my basement. So here goes.
A - The look is pure darkness. There is absolutely ZERO and I mean ZERO light that came through the beer. The second you begin pouring this beer you know it will have you. The head is nice and dark. Definitely can tell this is a proper imperial stout.
S - Smells of chocolate, coffee, licorice and more.
T - An explosion of flavor that has such character that it makes you want to take another sip. Each sip is unique with the finding of new tastes in each one. Chocolate, roasted barley, coffee, licorice, heavenly goodness. I noticed the bourbon taste has subdued due to aging.
M - Love the mouthfeel on this beer. It is thick and delicious and definitely not watered down.
D - This beer is really not meant to be drunk quickly being rich with flavor and 11%. However, the explosion of flavor beckons you to drink again, and again, and again. I wish I had a keg of this beer. 1,026 charactersEnigmaticDream, Jan 02, 2009
3.29/5  rDev -26.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 3 | taste: 3 | feel: 5 |  overall: 3Reviewed from notes from Early December 2008.
World Class...yeah...Not really. I really don't understand what all the hype is about. From our night of tasting, there were some many better expamples of Russian Imperial Stouts that we sampled.
A - Great example of a RIS. Black and thick syrup. Very nice.
S - Clean but really not much there. 
T - Cream. Dark. Thick. Dark chocolate but no bitterness. Molassas. No alcohol present which is a definite plus but sort of bland on taste. Just average in my book. Single layered. No fuss. Plain and simple in my book.
M - Love the thickness. For this reason...a 5.
D - Ok if I could find this but can't. Also, at 11%, little high....just right though for a RIS. Would I drink again? Yes but I think a few more years of aging would do this beer wonders. 801 charactersschellsbeer, Jan 01, 2009
4.73/5  rDev +5.6%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.52008 edition.
A- Poured into my New Belgium snifter, The Abyss pours deep black with a dense brown head that leaves thick layers of web-like lacing as it settles. A thin cap sits atop the beer for its duration.
S- Chocolate of both the milk and dark, bitter variety. Coffee, black licorice, molasses and a bit of oak char as well. The 11% ABV is pretty well-hidden. 
T- Flavors of chocolate and roasted/burnt malts hit the palate first, followed by a substantial espresso bitterness on the warming and slightly boozy finish. 
M- A silky-smooth texture with medium carbonation. 
D- This is really drinkable for an 11% ABV beer. The high alcohol content provides a nice warming sensation after each deliciously smooth sip. Both the sweet and bitter flavors work extremely well together. 
The best imperial stout that I've had thus far. I can't wait to see what a few years of age will do to this beer. 905 charactersTdizzle, Jan 01, 2009
4.43/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Big thanks to Finnman and gford for the bottles recieved from out Darkness trade. I dont know which one of you gave me this bottle, so I'll thank you both at the same time.
This is a 2007 bottle.
Poured from my wax dipped brown bomber, into an oversized brandy snifter.
Black in color, no transparency or glowing. 2 finger frothy, bubbly dark brown head. Receeding to a frothy cap of retention. Many globby bubbles sit atop the cap. Thin streaks of dark colored lace line my glass. Then slowly fall back into the beer. Leaving an inky streak on the glass walls.
Aroma of black licorice, moist sweet chocolate cake, coffee, chocolate nib nuttieness, hints of spice, some grassy hay aroma almost like dryed straw. 
Slick, creamy mouthfeel, with medium amounts of carbonation. A bit too much carbonation.
Its very sweet upfront, with a kind of gourmet creamy hot chocolate like sweet flavor. Becoming increasingly dark and bitter in the chocolate flavors. Increased nuttieness after the swallow with a long bitter dark chocolate linger. Dark roasted Coffee comes into play through this lingering period.
Some peppery spice through the swallow that quickly fades.
Alcahol warming throught its time in my mouth. Its not overkill, its just right.
This is a fantastic RIS and really has many layers of flavors that are noticeably occuring through the tasteing process. I love it for that.
Mouthfeel is a bit overcarbonated. This is a year old bottle, so I cant really be too judgemental, as its not fresh as intended by the brewer. To me though, the older the better.
So far though, Darkness is still my favorite RIS, but this is a fantastic brew.
I'm very much grateful to have been able to try it.
Thanks again Grant and Matt!

2010 Bottle
Poured from the bottle into an oversized snifter. Producing a little less then half an inch of head. 
Leaving a ring around the collar. Black, no light penetration. 
Aroma of roasted malt, chocolate, cocoa nibs, lactose, smokey wood and a hint at coffee as well as brewers licorice. 
Taste starts out chocolatey and sweet, mild, heating up and delivering a punch of rich and robust bitter grain flavors, blasting with a delayed response of massive bittering. roasted toasted wood, bitter bitter. 
Mouthfeel is slick and not as creamy as I remember it being. Well carbonated. Good beer, but not as I recalled it. 2,358 charactersBuebie, Dec 30, 2008
4.4/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4On draught at Freakin' Frog in Las Vegas. Pours black as night with a medium and foamy light brown head that has good retention. Rings of lacing on the glass. Big aroma of cocoa, roasted malt and bourbon. Rich body with bittersweet chocolate, roasted malt, coffee and a bit of spice. Light smoke and bourbon in the background throughout. The finish is full and moderately bitter coffee and hops with a sharp alcohol aftertaste. Would probably benefit from aging a bit. Overall this is a very good Imperial Stout. 512 charactersDogbrick, Dec 30, 2008

T- Coffee, roasted malt and vanilla, with a slight oak detection
m- Thick but not BCS thick, however your mouth will be coated in flavors.

4.82/5  rDev +7.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Alright, didn't think I was going to make it but it's time to review beer number 400. And HUGE HUGE HUGE thanks go out to ThirstyHopHead for getting me not one, not two, but three of these beauties.
First thing I notice is how thick the wax on the bottle is lcaked on, no air is getting into this bottle. Thick and black, a dark bloody orange and muddy brown head that slides ever so slowly down the side of the glass after each sip. Not much lacing, I figure the hops in this beer are fighting an uphill battle against the ABV in order to get some sticky lacing going.
Yes it's hoppy but not that over the top craziness that so many west coast imperial stouts like to do. Rich chocolate, bourbon, oaky, vanilla, buttery brown sugar
Opens with a quick hop punch , vinous and slightly fruity, then moves quickly into a sugary, chocolate and boozy concoction, the closing is a punch to the tongue, after a quick flame out of alcoholic heat a massive coffee bomb is dropped in my taste buds, rich, super roasty and quite bitter. Next sip slight raisin, more chocolate more boozy heat and again with that charred coffee and chocolaty finish. Mouthfeel is not as coating as, say, Goose Island BCS, which is (for me) the bench mark of oily and thick mouthfeels, instead it is surprisingly dry with only a glimpse of greasy thickness. Take that back, this beer is thick but chewier than anything else, like eating a chocolate bar. There is a lot to be said about this beer and a whole hell of a lot going on in even in this rather young bottle. Licorice, molasses and almost a meaty, tobacco-like quality, honey, bourbon. I think this one gets a five for taste and feel, I am a huge fan of BCS but this one has more to offer than BCS does, tons of complexity, thick and viscous mouthfeel wins if for me, just some fantastic things going on here.
I think for beers this size drinkability has to boil down to how enjoyable a beer is to drink, not how easy and following this line of thinking this beer is an absolute joy to drink, so complex, so thick and rich. Each sip brings something new to the table its hard to imagine how anything could improve on this, but I suppose only time will tell. So glad that I have more than one of these. Easily lives up to the hype, absolutely wonderful beer. 2,290 charactersbluemoonswoon, Dec 29, 2008

Black Hole is the only other thing that even comes close, because absolutely no light shines through this mother. Beautiful tan head as well. Smells like coffee and nuts and some whiskey notes with a little hop scent buried in the back. Huge licorice flavor with notes of chocolate, molasses and bourbon, very roasty as well.

Easily one of the best beers I've ever had. Just outstanding in every possible way. Having his with some chocolate and tiramisu right now. One of the most complex tasting beers I've had the pleasure of tasting. The chocolate, coffee, licorice and bourbon are so well balanced with the 11% alcohol that I could drink 10 of these. Smell is like an open fire under your nose. Probably the most 'warm' beer I've ever had. There is so much going on here. I want more!!!! 598 charactersprsguitarsr4me, Dec 27, 2008
4.65/5  rDev +3.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 42008 Abyss in a 22oz wax-top bottle!
A: Black as can be - memory tells me that only the Stone 12th Anniversary brew pours darker. Small, lasting brown head that leaves plenty of lacing. 
S: Fruit, roasted malts, coffee, licorice, chocolate...it's all there. Raisins, plums and espresso dominate the nostrils. 
T: Each sip, each gulp brings out new highlights. To me the licorice and toasty malts stand out. The brilliance lies in the balance achieved by the dry, bitter finish to what initially is ever so sweet.
M: Like I imagine a lighter crude oi. Feels smooth and has just enough carbonation. 
D: Began drinking this hours ago, and am now polishing it off. It is both the ideal winter aperitif and the perfect dessert. I was craving a stout all day and knew I had to pull another Abyss out of the cellar. 
Every bit as delicious as I have been led to believe. It lives up to the hype and then some. Deschutes is the heavyweight champion of darker ales.
The "problem" with the Abyss is that it sets a new benchmark for imperial stouts. Or put another way, will I be able to age the remaining four bottles before the craving sets in? 1,141 charactersjohnnieoz, Dec 27, 2008
4.25/5  rDev -5.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.52008
Appearance- A careful pour into my goblet produces a solid 2 fingers of creamy, dark khaki head. The body is black. No light is sneaking through, not even when held up to it. Good lacing squirms down my glass, but doesn't completely cake it. 
Smell- Roasted malt, dark drip coffee, milk chocolate, caramel, molasses, cookie dough, some vinous type sweetness, or maybe that's the licorice, a bit of heat, and a nice dose of floral hops. A pleasant smell that has good depth.
Taste- Bitter chocolate (I'm talking 90% cocoa type-bitter chocholate), espresso, roasted malts, and oak, take the lead with vinous and hop sweetness that tags along and finally assert themselves in the finish with the booziness of a strong wine. You can totally pick out the licorice and molasses used if your looking for it, and the same goes for the oak. I wish more vanilla would have been picked up from the bourbon barrels, but I suppose that's nitpicking. After the initial bitterness of the first few ounces wears on my tongue and mouth, the sweetness becomes more of the star and the chocolate smooths out. I also start to pick up more bourbon notes, but not the vanilla I was looking for. The nuances of this beer have been well documented, so I'll stop now and say that it is complex, and quite enjoyable; however, I feel like there is room for improvement. 
MF- A full body is kept at bay by a medium level of carbonation. The bitterness is drying on the tongue and the roof of my mouth, and there's still plenty of beer left to do more damage. The heat crawls up your nose a little bit, but not as much as some beers at this abv.
Drinkability- I'll be putting down this whole bomber by myself, and I'm not complaining, but this is a complex, big beer that would satisfy me just as much in smaller portions. I doubt I'll crave another Impy stout once I'm through with this bomber, and I almost find that Abyss has me craving copious amounts of water along side it.
*Bonus Reino comments* I've had quite a few Abyss bottles, even some with age on them, but I just now got around to reviewing it. I've always loved it, but it's never been my favorite big stout. I feel like their are a couple better, and a couple that are just as good. Anyways, it's a great beer and kudos to Deschutes for not raising the price this year, and making it available to more people. 2,358 charactersReino, Dec 27, 2008
5/5  rDev +11.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A- Beautiful black color with a thin mocha colored head that quickly diminishes but has some nice lacing.
S- Molasses first hits my nose with a pleasant oak distinction. If you take it in deep enough you get this slight burn from the alcohol. I'm guessing that's the bourbon but it is very subtle. I also get a nice roasted/charred smell coming out of the oak. Now that its warmed some the bourbon comes out more but its still not overpowering like other BA stouts I've had. 
M- Thick and creamy with a slight hop presence but just enough to remind you you're still drinking beer. A nice oiliness to coat your mouth for the aftermath. 
T- Dark bitter chocolate and mocha sweetness with the underlying bourbon that gives it a slight burn going down. Very complex beer with a lot of stuff going on but still manages to stay balanced. 
D- I could drink this all night. I know the 11% will catch up but if done in moderation it would be well worth it. 
Overall I would have to say this is one of the finest crafted beers I've had. Definitely worth the hype! I wish more BA stouts could be so well put together. 1,111 charactersdrgonzo3705, Dec 26, 2008

I was unable to pull a lot of aroma, some malt and subtle alcohol tones. The alcohol seemed to rule the aroma but not so in the taste. Taste was an excellent blend of coffee and chocolate and I was able to pull some hints of alcohol which is expected for an 11% beer. Excellent mouthfeel, good heavy body. I recommend trying this beer but it is heavy and packs a heavy punch. Taste wise and if enough was available I would drink this all day. 529 characterstbeck, Dec 25, 2008

S - The aroma starts off sweet then quickly moves to a roasted coffee intertwined with chocolate and licorice. Has a very strong stout presence with undertones of alcohol. 
T - Perfection. At first. it's too much to bare. Very strong roasted malt flavor. Chocolate seems to protrude past the initial flavors quickly carrying an oak complexity. as it leaves the palette there is a warmth of alcohol finishing with the starting profile of roasted malts. 
M - Very light for its Immense taste. Warms on the way down.
0 - Amazing. Am going to hold on to a few to see how they mature with time. 792 charactersDwnTwnBwn, Dec 24, 2008

S - Rich roasted malt aroma, primarily chocolate. Hints of roasted nut as well. A spicy hoppiness is present as well. 
T - Light malt sweetness up front. Chocolate and roasted nuts. Some toffee as well providing the sweetness. Spicy bitterness mid-drink. Hints of bourbon throughout gives a light alcohol bite. Finishes bittersweet and the taste lingers long after the drink.
M - Full bodied but just a little thinner than expected. Very light carbonation gives a relatively flat and smooth feel. 
D - Very easy drinking and the alcohol is hardly noticeable. Deceptively easy to put down. 717 charactersckeegan04, Dec 24, 2008

Thick mouthfeel with an alcohol burn in the finish. Just a little bourbon, which works well for me. This gets a little too sweet by the end and is a bit hard to drink.

A: Out of a brewing book. Black. This is what the tunnel you see when you die looks like. Poured like motor oil and left a finger of coffee colored head.
S: The mix of this massive stout and the oak really is something special. The roasted smell is not as big as I thought it would be. The chocolate is there but perhaps fading a little bit. Little bit of sweetness thrown in there for good measure as well.
T:Oh hell yes. Big blast of chocolate covered coffee beans. Damn is it good and intense. Then you get a hint of the barrel. The nose was mostly barrel but this is just an intense blast of chocolate. Almost feels like having cocoa powder ground into my tongue. Sweetness is there as well but it barely holds anything back. A touch of bitterness right before and into the finish.
m: Nice and full bodied. Really just great creamy mouthfeel.
D: Incredible. Glad I held off on this one for a while and saved it for a night like this. This is a damn fine beer. Big and bold while not hitting you with a hammer. THe barrel aging did something really nice for this beer. No hint of the ABV at all. World class. 1,245 charactersaerozeppl, Dec 20, 2008

The nose was one of the nicest noses I have ever smelled on a beer, hints of bourbon, some chocolate, some vanilla, tons of malt and hops. The taste of this beer was beautiful, hints of the bourbon barrels, vanilla, choclate and a large hop flavor for a stout. The mouthfeel was very nice and the carbonation level was very good as well.

4.73/5  rDev +5.6%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poored this brew into an oversize wine glass after purchasing from Fred G. Meyer, who had 22oz bombers for $8.99. Smoken!
Opaque midnight, that's the color and the head is about as dark brown as you can get when it come to foam. Head retention is modest at best which is about what is expected for this style. Nose is absolutely rich, roast, toasty and altogether quite complex and somewhat reminiscent of a really good port. Roasted malts have a coffee characteristic with some smokey and burnt tones floating about as well. Esters are subdued but play their part. 
Flavor is quite deep and bit difficult to explain. I think that's a good thing! Initially it tastes fairly intense and the roasted, toasted, malty, estery, smokey, fruity, sweet and slightly sour flavors all come together. You're just gonna have to try it.
This is a full bodied, velvety beer that slides right down your gullet.
I got one word, intense.

People who complain that ratings are based on hype are going to hate this one. I don't care. This was a damn fine beer and well deserving of the hype.
Thick, spent motor oil pour. Black with dark brown highlights on the edges. Dark tan head - falls quick
Smell: Light booziness at first but then blended well with dark chocolate, vanilla, oak and coffee
Flavor: Dark chocolate, dark fruit, burnt caramel, vanilla, oaky, buttery, light hop oil finish.
MF: Thick, viscous, oily, creamy and slick, light carbonation tingle
Alcohol is very present in the nose but surprising light on the tongue - well masked boozines. So goddamn tasty, who cares. Best of the night.
EDIT: 
7/23/09 
Recently revisited this one with some friends, this time an '08. Absolutely fantastic. Not aged as long as my first sampling (the '07 was about a year old) but this tasted every bit as good. Oakiness was much stronger on the fresher bottle, a little more bourbon could be noted. What a great beer. Scores the same. 1,058 charactersKeefD, Dec 16, 2008
4.7/5  rDev +4.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.52008 release bottle poured into a 12oz snifter - shared with my wife. This is one classy bottle - with the simple but strong label and the elegant hand-waxed cap. This would make an excellent gift.
Pouts jet black with a nice gray-tan head which dissipates over about 45 seconds, leaving behind a dirty layer on top with some pockets of soapy bubbles. When tilted, there's a thin caramel brown layer, which quickly turns into the jet black pool.
The aroma has strong roasted notes. You can appreciate the barrel in the aroma as well - a nice rich smooth aroma. There is quite a bit of coffee in there too. Invites me to take the first sip. A gentle shake, brings the coffee out even more as well as some new aromas. Something I can't name here - smells almost like overripe bananas... but that's not it.
The flavor is immensely complex. Bitter chocolate, coffee, roasted malt. There is a trace of bourbon, and definite tannin and oak. There's a little chalkiness - not only to the mouthfeel, but to the taste as well. That faint "overripe banana" is there as well. And the tiniest amount of sourness. The finish is bitter, but the malt carries through to the end as well. It's a bit hot, but not boozy. Over the course of the bottle, the chocolate builds quite a bit. 
The mouthfeel is incredibly thick and a bit chalky. It coats the mouth completely. The bubbles are tiny and plentiful.
Drinkability is pretty high on this since it's so tasty and the alcohol is well hidden.
This is an incredible imperial stout and it's obvious this one will hold up to cellering. Somewhere between 4.5 and 5 for taste. 1,610 charactersjpiper, Dec 15, 2008
4.17/5  rDev -6.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4This ain't no kid's beer. Anyone who likes this style of beer, will love this one. 
After removing the black wax from the bottle (nice touch by the way, it makes it seem more mysterious and causes your anticipation level to build) I poured this dark brown to the point of almost being black brew into a chalice. A thin light brown head forms and remains, leaving a slippery looking brown film along the sides of the glass. Good looking but not outstanding.
Now the aroma comes into play. Yes there's that roasted coffee smell, along with licorice, molasses and only a hint of dark chocolate and alcohol. Very intriguing and nice.
Time to put it in my mouth for a taste. Again, the coffee is there. Now, I'm of the opinion that if I wanted to taste coffee, I'd drink ... a coffee. Never liked it in my beer, but this really wasn't too over the top. Next up was the dark chocolate. It featured more in the taste than in the smell, and it balanced out the coffee nicely. The molasses was there as it warmed, but I lost sight of the licorice that appeared in the smell. The alcohol was still there, but only lurking in the background. 
The mouthfeel was excellent. Certainly on the thicker end of the scale. Smooth and silky in the mouth and going down the throat. 
Well what can be said that already hasn't been mentioned? Once again, if you like this style of beer, and especially the taste of coffee in your beer, this is probably as good as it gets. For the price ($9.99 for a 22 oz bottle) it's quite a bargain. All in all this is a very well done beer from the folks at Deschutes. One of the best beers in the world? That's up to you to decide. 1,651 charactersJBogan, Dec 14, 2008
4.5/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A- Motor oil consistency of black. Low lacing.
S- Big oaky/bourbon, buttery chocolate, molasses/caramel. 
T- Starts out with a nice oakiness, some nice dark chocolates and bits of coffee. The finish is equally enjoyable.
M- Buttery, smooth, low carbonation.
D- This was a very nice and drinkable stout but it, in my opinion, didn't live up to what I though it would be. I'll definitely have it again though, given the opportunity. 434 charactersGreggy, Dec 14, 2008
4.1/5  rDev -8.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.5I can finally check this one off of my to-do list. I was able to find this one on the shelves in San Francisco and I brought this big ol bottle in my suitcase back and broke into it very quickly.
Not sure it quite lived up to its hype but I surely see the quality poking through. Just not the perfection that I had heard about.
Bottle Graphics: 7/10.
A: Poured into a dogfish snifter. Pitch black body with a minor head and lacing that started out strong but unravelled like pulling down curtains. Wow, that was interesting and enticing.
S: Coffee, minor bitterness, and raw alcohol. Smoky wood, licorice- overall extremely complex nose. I like the aroma better because it had a lower delivery of licorice that become reduntant in the taste.
T: Licorice, borderline overkill on the licorice. To balance the licorice and nib flavors, the bitter spin was not enough to cover its end of the bargain. With the hazelnut coffee flavor, the sweetness seems very organic and pure. The alcohol is absent on one swallow, overbearding on the next. I like that. The smoked flavors that leave me daydreaming of fire roasted marshmallows are the shining star in the taste of this bottle.
M: Chewy as all hell, delivers in spades here. I thought I was going to have to break out a knife and fork from the complex texture. The look shows carbonation, but the coating mouthfeel doesn't let it through.
D: This is a strong beer that packs something of a wallop but compared to the other that are the top and well regarded, this one doesn't stand up as tightly. Again, it is well above average but just not world class in my opinion. The 22oz was just the right amount as it really let its character out on different sips, primarily from the warming. 1,737 charactersmarcpal, Dec 14, 2008

Dark like the night with a minimal coffee tan head. Smooth, chocolate, coffee, roasted malts. Incredibly tasty with a fantastic aroma that draws you in. Only downside is trying to finish more than one pint. Abyss is a big beer but I'll gladly drink it again any day. 422 charactersantilogic, Dec 14, 2008
4.83/5  rDev +7.8%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 52008 bottle. A little early but I couldn't wait anymore.
Pours an evil black that seems to actually suck light in. The dark head looks like chocolate peanut butter with serious lacing. Smells like sweet licorice and dark chocolate. 
And the taste... oh the taste... Incredibly smooth with the slightest carbonation. The flavor really opens up after it's on it's way down. The balance is f'ing perfect. I can't even begin to describe the flavors. It's too many and too unique for me to have any idea.
Drinkability... hmm... What do you rate something that would be the one thing you take to a desert island? 609 charactersIrie, Dec 14, 2008

Pours an amazingly dark jet black. smells full bodied, with large hints of cocoa and coffee. The '07 has mellowed out quite nicely, the '08 needs some time, but was still deliocious. This beer coats your pallet and stays with you all the way. A sipper but not a sipper like Goose Island. Get some of this and put it away for a few years and you won't be dissapointed. 415 charactersBevMoPatrick1, Dec 13, 2008

Thanks to Beechwood for brining this in!
A-Black or the darkest brown that the eye can not differentiate, with a drak tan (or light brown) firm, full head.
S- Chocolate all over the place! A little bit of hops if you spend enough time drawing out the aroma. 
T-Powder cocoa, wood, coffee and the usual suspects.
M-slightly chalky (powedered cocoa), rich and deep, thick, thick, thick
D-It is wonderful, but one 10 ounce glass is about all that I can handle at a time (three times, so far). This is definitely a last beer of the evening. I had my second pint at a happy hour and I was done as soon as I finished. It was 7:00 and I couldn't even think about following it up with anything else or even a second. 759 charactersopwog, Dec 12, 2008
4.73/5  rDev +5.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I have read a lot of fuss over this beer and was very eager to try it out! 
A: clouded black color, viscous-like consistency with deep red and bourbon hues when held up to the light. Lace was sporadic in the snifter and hung on for dear life amidst my few swishes. Head started of deep brown color and dissipated quickly. Looks banging in the glass
S: robust malts, dark and sweet overall with brown sugar/molasses rounding out the sweet. Subtle alcohol notes in the mix as well. I was rather surprised to find the smell somewhat subdued
T: huge robust malts with hints of roasted coffee and chocolate. Wow! this beer is large and in charge. After a few sips I could pick up a light roasted coconut sweetness, dash of vanilla bean, and burnt caramel candies...what heavy hitter! I must say a very complex brew! Illustrious!
M: smooth as silk, touch of dryness that is left from a slight grain-like, warming alcohol presence. Mouthfeel is top notch
D: I did not taste any liquorice (as it states), but in any event a great friggen beer. Man, I have been looking for this in the bottle everywhere and can not get a hold of it. I can see why! great, great stuff! This is how the beer gods reward us, with beer of this caliber! I also must admit that I was just getting over a 24-hour flu bug and my senses were not 100%. I debated about ordering this guy as I might lack the true palate of flavors, in any event I could not say no! 1,433 charactersMagpie14, Dec 12, 2008

4.88/5  rDev +8.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This is a bottle of the '07 Abyss poured into a very sturdy Rogue chalice. Pours black with a beautiful brown head that dissappates quickly. The aroma is bold and very upfront. It had the bourbon aroma from the barrels. I'm not a coffee drinker and with age the coffee flavors and aromas have really come forward, which is why this beer loses a few points with me. The mouthfeel is exceptional. Well rounded and fulfilling. This is very drinkable, caution is advised. You should drink this beer when you get the chance and let some age when you get the chance. 560 charactersbeertunes, Dec 10, 2008

Light roast malt aromas mostly of a rich coffee like espresso. Flavor is very smooth. Just the right amount of malt to make it very drinkable without having to wait years for it to mellow out except for the high alcohol that leaves a warm burn on in your throat. Thinner than a lot of Imperial Stouts. Carbonation is just right. This is so easy to drink its unbelievable. A good beer but not as good as Big Skys Ivan the Terrible that is a somewhat the same type of beer. 549 charactersbigbelcher, Dec 09, 2008

Pours black as night with a thin layer of chocolate head, good lacing throughout. The smell is pretty great; chocolate , slight oak, not much roastedness which I enjoy, and hints of vanilla. The taste is pretty damn well balanced, very similar to what I smelled. This is one of the first barrel aged RISs that I've had and I like what it's done for the overall flavor. The alcohol is nearly gone considering this was an 08'. Drinkability is high for this amazing beer. 601 charactersxpimptastikx, Dec 09, 2008
4.88/5  rDev +8.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This might just be a perfect beer!!! The kind of gustatory experience that makes life worth living!
The smell is lovely (though maybe just a tiny bit hot of alcohol). It's beautifully dark brown from the bottle, almost black and completely opaque in the glass with a thin, dark chocolate head. The smell is roasty, smokey, with a definite molasses sweetness. There is no burnt taste--that's the one aspect of this style that I like least; so I'm happy that it is absent here. There is coffee and chocolate in both the nose and the palate. The flavor is sweet, but the mouthfeel is dry. Many brewers add candy sugar to try to achieve what this beer accomplishes, but it doesn't generally seem to work to me. There is no candy sweetness here; instead the sweetness seems to come from the molasses and natural grain sugar. Though the smell is a just bit hot, the alcohol is very well hidden in the taste--something I really like in a high alcohol beer. This beer is brewed with licorice and I notice it in the middle. The oak adds just a bit of spice to the finish. The malt profile is really full and constitutes the biggest part of the taste--the roasted malt is on point and really great. As for drinkability, I'm sharing this bomber with a life-long friend--we both wish we had (at least) another bottle. The friend I'm sharing the bottle with, says he thinks the bourbon barrel aging adds to the depth of the smokiness. I'm going to get another bottle (at least) tomorrow at Hi-Times. I LOVE THIS BEER!! 1,506 charactersPhiloPsych, Dec 08, 2008

A - Sniftered. A brown head on top of an appropriately black body sits in front of beckoning "Drink me". Head retention is decent, lacing is present. Spot on.
S - Smokey, chocolately, boozy. Miniscule hints of bourbon, a wine-like oakiness. The molasses is also very small, but there. I'm having a hard time finding the licorice in the nose. Complex, well-rounded. Not the absolute best RIS I've ever smelled, but definitely up there with the big boys.
T - Starts with a dry smokey note, that transforms in a huge chocolate flavor without being sweet. Random nuances come and go... coffee, molasses. Licorice and bourbon really aren't present. Finishes dry and bitter.
M - A nice, smooth carbonation with a big body. If it were a tad thicker it'd be a 5.
D - For a big ass, 11%, partially barrel-aged RIS, this thing is supreme in drinkability.
Notes: Oh man. I was expecting the usual RIS and this one is blowing me away. Part of me is bummed I waited this long to crack it, but the other part of me is happy I still have another bottle left.

2007 Reserve
Solid 2 fingers of extra dark mocha. Oil slick black hole for light trying to pass through. Lacing, staying power
Port, baking chocolate. I dont get to smell molases often, but gosh there is something dark and sweet in it, it has to be it. Espresso? Boy is this full of different smells. It just smells warm
Coffee, some biscuit. Some sort of hops, almost overpowering of the dark malt.
Warming no bite. Hop character in the finish, stays with it. Roasted malt, not overpowering.
I want to say the hop something in there is a bit too much over the the roasted malt. I hate to give it only a 4, but with a RIS, I dont want that in the balance. It could also have something to do with the age, who knows.
I will certainly trade for again. 818 charactersJasonA, Dec 07, 2008
4.15/5  rDev -7.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4A: Deep black with semi-fluffy brown head that eventually fades to a 1/2 finger with good lacing.
S: lots of vanilla and dark chocolate. I get whiff of the licorice. It's milky and sweet as well with some booziness.
T?M: First thing that struck me was the mouthfeel. This stout just didn't have the creaminess of a Dark Lord or Darkness, two beers it's ranked right up there with. Still, don't get me wrong, it's plenty smooth with good carbonation though possibly the smallest smidge high.
Taste is very complex. Smooth and milky sweet at first, fades to anise and bitter dark chocolate. At this point a hop bite pushes through with some spice and ends in a long finish with the alcohol providing some sting. All the while there's a smoky hickory flavor going on in the background that gets more pronounced as you go along.
Ovr: this was the 2008. I bet it's be really great with a year on it, just to smooth it out a touch. There's a bit of harshness on the finish and it could probably benefit from resting. Very very nice, but I'm comparing this to the best stouts I've had this year, Dark Lord and Darkness, and I've have to put this behind both of them. Still worth seeking out, however. 1,197 charactersejquin, Dec 06, 2008

I was so excited when I saw this, and I can happily say that it lived up to all of my expectations. Midnight black pour with a thick, 1 cm tall brown head. Heavy aroma of burnt coffee, tobacco, chocolate, molasses, leather, wood, and just a little bourbon. Amazing taste. Lots of roasty malt, bitter coffee, baker's chocolate up front and throughout. A deep, rich oak taste accompanies the sweeter molasses and licorice flavors. A bittersweet finish with just a little caramel malt and hop bite. I could drown in this beer its so good. 562 charactersmagictrokini, Dec 05, 2008

The 2007 Reserve poured into my Duvel glass. 
This beer pours jet black with a nice mocha color head that disappears quickly and leaves nice lacing on the glass. Smells roasty with chocolate, espresso, raisins and rum. The taste follows the aroma and does not disappoint. This beer has many complexities and it seems like I discover another with each sip. Starts with a sort of citrus taste then Chocolate, coffee, rum, raisins and figs. The aftertaste is of strong coffee and has that lovely chewyness. The mouthfeel has medium to full body and is incredibly smooth and nicely carbonated. Drinkability is excellent considering the high abv. One of the best stouts in the world? Who cares, this is a great beer. 754 charactersjohnd513, Dec 05, 2008

Appearance: Pours jet black; good head and lacing.
Smell: Not as strong as I expected. Molasses, fudge chocolate, brown sugar.
Taste: Heavy malt, bitter chocolate, coffee/espresso, molasses, brown sugar, toffee. A little sweet. I get no bourbon or oak. This has none of the typical complexity I see, and like to see, in a RIS
Mouthfeel: Full, but not huge.
Drinkability: Not sure what the hype is, it is ok, nothing special besides rarity. A little heavy on the coffee/bitter for me and lacking in complexity.
NB: Why on earth do they only age a % of it in oak? Put the whole thing in the barrel!!! 624 characterscraytonic, Dec 04, 2008
4.88/5  rDev +8.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 52008 version poured into an imperial pint glass: freshness date encoded in typical Deschutes fashion.
P: Pours jet black from the bottle while hardly showing any light aside from dark-maroon highlights that barely manage to sneak through. The liquid lays in the glass an ominous, completely opaque black color that threatens to kick your ass from the start! Mild pour produces a 2-fingered frothy, rocky, yet sturdy head that shows great retention for a stout packing an 11% ABV punch. Even when the foam does settle to form a halo on top and an island of bubbles in the middle, it leaves behind memories of its former self in the form of beautiful sticky lacing that literally blankets my glass. Wow! The golden standard for which RIS's are judged.
A: Bourbon-y alcohol dominates the nose, but doesn't choke the life out of the roasted chocolate malts, dark molasses, espresso, slight vanilla, and some oak tannins from the barrel that are quite pronounced. Aromatics are nice!
T: Oh, man! Hits the palate with a sweet, maple-flavored molasses taste that is accompanied by subtle tones of earthiness underneath, while chocolate, espresso, and vanilla accompany a hefty dash of black licorice. Meanwhile, the malt flavors continue to hold down the fort, while not letting the sweetness overtake this powerful regime at any point in time. Just when you think the sweet side may gain the upper-hand in the battle, the Bourbon-aged alcohol (while accompanied by an escort of roasted chocolate malts) slashes through the crowd of complex flavors to deliver the final death blow. The finish is quite dry, and really warms up the tongue, throat, and chest upon swallow. Phenomenal!
M: The Abyss is packing more heat than Plaxico Burress in this department (yet never shoots itself in the foot). It's very much a full-bodied brew that feels viscous on the palate, yet incredibly smooth and deceptively mellow in the mouth. Coats the palate and is exactly what I am looking for in an RIS of this magnitude. Perfection.
D: I would love nothing more than to have a couple more of these bottles to enjoy tonight. But unfortunately, the hefty (but more than worth it) price tag makes this impossible. I could drink The Abyss all night long, as it tastes so damn good. But, 2 bottles of this stuff would probably have the same effect as a perfectly-thrown right cross from Rampage Jackson...and I'd be napping on the job like the Iceman himself.
Notes: Honestly, I didn't think that The Abyss could ever live up to the hype that was built up by my fellow BA's. But I'll be damned! It sure in the hell did...and then some! I do think, however, that it would be out-of-this-world if it had a year or two on it. I think the alcohol would mellow out, and the rest of the flavors would become more pronounced. Having said that, this is absolutely fabulous! Although, I have heard that last years' release was better than this years'. If so, I would love to find out how it could top this. Best beer I've had the honor of drinking, no doubt about it!
Edit: This was my first (and only) perfect 5 review I've ever given out. However, after having had many more RIS's since then, I have adjusted the score accordingly. 3,204 characterssweetbrew82, Dec 04, 2008
4.05/5  rDev -9.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 42007 version on tap at City Beer in San Francisco. Poured jet black with a thick foamy brown head. Some wispy lacing on the glass as I drank. Flavor of deep roasted malt with some bitter chocolate, almost like a bitter chocolate milkshake. Maybe a little coffee in there. Aroma was similar, with the chocolate a little more dominant. In my opinion, the roasting was maybe a little too aggressive, as this is a pretty bitter brew. Very thick and rich mouth feel, and surprisingly drinkable with all that alcohol. 511 charactersRunDWP, Dec 03, 2008
4.6/5  rDev +2.7%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.52008 Edition. Let me start out by saying that this is a phenomenal beer, and my scores were given some room to go up as the beer ages. Of any beer that I've ever had, this beer gives me the clearest picture of what it means to drink a beer too early. I can easily imagine the alcohol cooling and the flavors taking on a smoother blend. That said, it's still a really excellent stout right now.
At any rate, the beer looks incredible. It pours a deep black with an intimidating head. It looks like a thick dark, dark roast coffee brewed superhumanly strong. It's an intimidating pour but looks quite appropriate in the snifter.
The beer smells phenomenally good. At first, it's thickly smoky, but this gives way readily to vast complexity. It's sweet with fiery alcohol and earthy with the subtlety of oak. I don't mean to sound stupid there, but I feel overwhelmed by this good of a RIS nose.
The taste has a lot of strong notes that are all battling it out. They're all quite good and I certainly enjoy the beer very much, but everything is not yet quite melded. There's strong alcohol, strong bourbon, strong smoke, strong wood, strong malt, good bitterness and good sweetness, but the battle almost burns the mouth.
This burn is a bit of a problem in the feel and the carbonation is a tad sharp but maybe just in relation to the flavor. It's not so much that the carbonation is strong, but that it burns the flavor in a bit uncomfortably. Alright, I'll be honest. I'm really searching for something to pick on and feel seemed like an easy category, the nerdy kid of the bunch. The feel is marvelous, but I'm probably going to far prefer it in a couple years.
The beer is, of course, highly drinkable. Its 11% abv tastes like smooth fire and the smoke grows and grows on you. It's a shame that I tried it so early. Now, I'm just going to be counting the days on the bottles in my cellar. Thank you, Deschutes, for this phenomenal beer. 1,942 characterspopery, Dec 02, 2008
5/5  rDev +11.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5pours deep, dark black. I held it up to the brightest light in the house and nothing came through. Pours thick with a dark brown milk chocolate head that perfectly complements it's black body. fantastic smell. Hints of chocolate, coffee, and molasses. I also noticed the licorice for the first time tonight... this beer just keeps getting better!
the best part of the beer, is, of course, the flavor. An overwhelming sensation of as many flavors as could possibly be put in a single brew, the flavor lingers long after you drink, and each sip is like the first. Again, hints of chocolate, coffee (though not as much as expected from the smell), molasses and licorice. the after-taste is of roasted coffee beans, and tootsie-roll. The barrel aging is subtle, smooth, and awesome.
As thick as expected in the mouthfeel! Smooth as silk. As if the flavor explosion isn't enough for your mouth to handle, this beer's thickness makes a statement. gentle on the palate, and very warming. perfectly carbonated. extremely drinkable. The most I've had in a single night was two 22oz bottles and I felt like I was going to explode (although I ate a huge meal before that which probably didn't help). It's the kind of beer that you look at when you only have one drink left and think to yourself, "I better savor this sip more than any other." Goes down easy and fills you up, leaving you wanting more. 1,392 charactersjdklks, Nov 30, 2008

Appearance- About as dark as you can get blackness. Dirty white, milk chocolate colored 3/4 inch head. Leaves sticky pacthes and trails of lace.
Smell- Nose is of mid range chocolate. Combo between dark and bittersweet. Some mild hops detected. Smells fairly sweet. Not really any coffe, but a light oaky nose is detected.
Taste- Super and I mean super deep dark bitter chocolate. We're talking 85% plus here. Lots of hops too. Hops are still strong and not muted at all as I was expecting. I was expecting a large sweetness which really didn't come to truition because of the bitter backlash of the chocolate. A very light barrel aged flavor. Sweetness is held in check until the very end of the bottle when it creeps into play.
Mouthfeel- Long lasting chocolate sticky bitter aftertate. Medium to lower carbonation level. Definite full mouthfeel.
Drinkability- I've had these bottles for two plus years, plus my other vinatges and finally tried one. Good...make that better than good...but not the greatness I was hoping for. Was thinking it would be a bit more thick and sweet. Guess I got spoiled by the Goose Island Bourbon County Stout I have been drinking recently. May get more sweet though as the years go on. Have heard the newer vinatges are sweeter. Still a solid two thumbs up. 1,440 charactersGClarkage, Nov 30, 2008

Burnt sugar, chocolate, and malt
Great taste, caramel and smoke up front, followed by dark malt and alcohol, but not too much, after.
Little effervescent, but quite nice
Goes down very well, and not overly strong, but still not one I'd be having too many of! 408 charactersChelsea1905, Nov 29, 2008

A - Dark black pour, little head but sticks around. Leaves a slight amount of lacing.
S - Notes of rich chocolate, cocoa, light caramel, and plenty of anise.
T - Chocolate, coffee, grassy hops, anise, and a slight roasted bitterness from the black patent.
M - Very full bodied, slightly syrupy and sweet with a light lacing of bitterness.
D - Overall excellent beer. Do you see the word alcohol mentioned in here? Anywhere? That's the difference between this year's and last year's abyss. Fantastic beer!!
In fact I went to Nugget supermarket and grabbed a couple of bottles after I finished 2 pints. Couldn't believe they poured pints last night at the owl club. 710 charactersMisterClean, Nov 27, 2008
4.7/5  rDev +4.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5This is my first review, and while I was going to wait until I had more experience drinking good beer before taking a stab at reviewing this but this one was so incredible I had to write down what I could. Previous to this my experience with stout had been Guinness. I apologize in advance for my lame noob review. :)
A: Poured into a large mug, very dark, and thick. Two inch brown head that stuck around awhile.
S: Chocolate, rich dark chocolate. Also the alcohol cleared the sinuses.
T: Dark chocolate flavor is real dominant, followed by the sweet mollases aftertaste, and alcohol warmth.
M: Thick, and smooth. I read someone elses review that said this was thinner than previous years, since this is my first Abyss I have no basis to debate that. But this was thick in my book, ecspecially when I let it warm a bit. Nice slight carbonation, not too much, not too little. Went down real smooth.
D: I could drink this all night long, it is smooth, flavorfull, and enjoyable. The ABV is high so obviously I would be limited to probably 2 before passing out, but that is ok as I drank this real slow to enjoy the flavor anyways.
Docked a half point on drinkability due to the strong alcohol that will most likely smooth out with age (which is why I am aging some). This is by far the best beer I have ever drank. Now with my limited experience that may not be saying much, but I think other reviews of this beer pretty much say the same thing and I will definately get my hands on this whenever available. 1,512 charactersPuckX, Nov 26, 2008
4.2/5  rDev -6.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4A: Pours like motor oil. Nice pitch black with a dense dark brown head. Little lacing
S: Brown sugar, cocoa, roasted malt, coffee. Pretty complex.
T/M: Full bodied and creamy. Same as the smell. Sugary coffee and chocolate. Roasted malt. This is dessert in a glass. I let it warm up some and the flavors really come out. One flaw: there's a lingering bitterness that's a little out of place. Is that hop overload?
D: Very dense and mouth coating so don't know how much I could really put down. Availability is definitely up this year, so can't knock it on that.
Overall, a great RIS. I'd still prefer a Port Santa's Helper, or the Surly Darkness I had the other night, but this is damn good. 695 charactersabfraser, Nov 26, 2008
4.8/5  rDev +7.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4I found this on tap at the Malt and Vine in Redmond, Wa. Served in a tulip glass. This was my first imperial stout, so it was like losing your virginity to the woman of your dreams...I have absolutely no basis for comparison but it was everything that I imagined (and more).
Aroma: Roasted malts and dark resinous fruits. Cocoa, coffee, prunes, raisins, with some alcohol present.
Appearance: Beautiful. A tar dark night with a leather-colored head that seemed to last forever. I think this is the first time I've ever noticed legs on a beer and I doubt it's owing entirely to the glass.
Flavor: Complex beyond belief. Bittersweet chocolate, tar, black licorice, coffee, with a lingering roasted and earthy flavor.
Mouthfeel: Velvety smooth. Mouth-coating. I paced myself and savored the beer to the point that by the end it had become a little syrupy.
Drinkability: Some folks say all day. I agree in that I would be a happy man if I smelled, saw and tasted this forever. At 11 ABV, however, I'd pass out before too long. It's a matter of the serving size being too big for the style. It's not the beer's fault, but I'm still comfortable in saying that it's not exceptionally drinkable. That said, I would have enjoyed the beer more in a smaller serving and an accordingly lower price. 
Overall, an intense and complex beer that I found to be very very enjoyable. 1,370 charactersrobertjohnson, Nov 26, 2008

A) Black as black can be, with good finger size head, beautifully moves back and forth in the sniffer: almost dancing.
S) The aroma is my favorite part of this beer perhaps. Explosion of flavor (cloves and vanilla especially) into my nostrils.
T) Sweet chocolate initially, and the flavor gradually turns to bitter chocolate surrounded with molasses, sassafras, licorice, figs, and cloves. At the end, the french oak and vanilla is present.
M) full but does not coat my mouth
D) Dangerously drinkable; can not not stop drinking this beer unless too appreciate its smell and look
This beer is a very holistic experience for me. 834 charactersmykie73, Nov 25, 2008
4.35/5  rDev -2.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Side by side comparison of the 2007 and 2008 Abyss from a bottle.
A: Both are very dark like a good imperial stout. Both had a thick foamy head that reduced down and left a lot of lacing on the sides when drank.
S: The '08 had a strong olive smell, underneath that was a bit of cloves, coffee, Chardonnay white wine, and something slightly like molasses. The '07 had a much more mild scent; coffee, vanilla, oak, and malts.
T: Tasted the '07 first: strong high quality coffee taste with a bit of brown sugar, also of chocolate, and vanilla. Had mild notes of molasses and syrup. The '08 tasted like a more bitter coffee, vanilla, cloves, chocolate and maybe a touch of banana.
M: The '07 was thick, almost chewy, very full-bodied. Went down incredibly smooth. The '08 was a lot lighter, not near as thick. Was still smooth.
D: Both were great to drink. Overall I think the '07 was better. Aging definetly improves the taste, mellows the stronger flavors yet enriches the more subtle notes. But both were a pleasure to drink regardless of the age. 1,051 charactersHatTrick, Nov 25, 2008

I told the misses to pick anything we haven't tried. She passes up our recently acquired Darkness, Dark Lork, and Firestone 11 and says "the Abyss." I have an '06 and an '07 and I've never even tasted Abyss before. WTF? So here we go at 53 degrees with an '06 Abyss oh hell yeah.
How dark do you think the Abyss is? I'm looking right at it and I can't say. It's dark. Sumbitch is dark black. Incredible head of dark tan mush. Monumental retention. An absolutely gorgeous beer. I've been waiting for something to give a 5 for appearance and I've found it. Hate to do it, but I don't have a choice. Enough staring, let's move on to sniffing.
I get raisins, figs, dark dark chocolate, and cocoa. Does it need anything else? Powerful and pleasant scent.
Taste is remarkably similar to the nose but in reverse order. I get the cocoa first, then the chocolate and dark fruits. 
Of course it tastes good, but what shines here is the silkiness. Smoothest beer ever!!!
Alcohol is .... well, where the hell is it? I feel it a little but sure don't taste it. I know it's there because I'm in a great fucking mood. Just offered to help the brother-in-law move a couch. In 20 minutes.
Did the deed and came back to one more glass of this marvelous monster. It was a little too strong for the missus, so, like the knight in shining fucking armor that I am, I courageously drank her share. Fair trade since I did all the cooking today.
Overall: an awesome brew 1,632 charactersPatronWizard, Nov 24, 2008

A-Poured with a thin, but very dense, dark brown head, which reduced relatively quickly to a ring of bubbles around the glass. This beer is black, black, with a little more black, allowing no light through. When swirled, it shows some viscosity on the side of the glass.
S-Some very clear raisin and plummy dried fruit estery aromas. Some additional malt sweetness, but most of the malt aromas are roasty. A bit of alcohol aroma is able to cut through.
T-The dominant flavors are heavily roasted malts and raisins. Some other estery flavors also have a chance to come through. There seemed to be some hints of chocolatey sweetness on the edges of my tongue. A smooth alcoholic flavor eases its way in with a prominent warmth.
M-Full, thick bodied beer; medium-high viscosity, as described under appearance. Some graininess, but this is not offensive. This big beer gives me some very nice warmth in my belly.
D-This one is quality! Very enjoyable.
Thanks to my brother Lofgrep for sharing this with me. 1,075 charactersCHSLBrew, Nov 24, 2008

4.9/5  rDev +9.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5This may be the imperial stout I've been waiting for. (Too bad I have to fly almost 2,000 miles to get another bottle!) As black as its namesake with a rich chocolate aroma. Creamy, dense caramel-colored head, and the creaminess carries over into the first sip right through the last. The flavor is a perfect blend of all the qualities you want in an imperial stout (though most that try to blend these come up a little off): smokey chocolate, raisins, molasses, a faint though unmistakable vinous undercurrent, and some boozy oak. Just sweet enough up front, just dry enough on the finish, with a slight, pleasant alcohol burn. Reminiscent of Leinenkugel's Big Eddy RIS, though more intense, and with a better, dryer finish. I'll be back in the Bay area in two weeks -- let's hope the shelves aren't empty! 807 charactersFlyer, Nov 23, 2008
4.74/5  rDev +5.8%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4I split a bottle of the 2008 and had a snifter of 2007 from the tap at City Beer Store in San Francisco.
The appearance is a characteristic, opaque black, with a fairly dark and thin head and excellent lacing.
The smell is delicious and complex. I get a thick, alcoholic vapor that almost feels like Vicks on a deep inhalation. It's far too complex to fully describe; chocolate and dark fruits are apparent, with some smoke here, some vanilla there.
Taste is excellent. The 2008 had more of a kick of sweetness after swallowing, while the 2007 was smooth throughout. I'm not sure which I liked more, but you should consider aging a bottle (or 10) in the cellar. Vanilla is more apparent, as is a molasses sweetness, with coffee showing up here and there, and I get very faint notes of mint and coconut. The complexity in taste is even more difficult to pin down than the smell; every sip is something new, as the rising temperature, swirls of the glass, and my changing attitude each seemed to reveal a new facet of its profile. A wonderful beer to taste, but a sheer frustration for a reviewer.
This a delicious beer that you don't want to hurry through. I found every sip to be worthy of new examination. The bottle I split was enough to feel the alcohol.
I've stocked my cellar and hope they last through Spring. 1,320 charactersgyllstromk, Nov 22, 2008
4.18/5  rDev -6.7%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 3.5Note: 2008 Bottle
A - The glass mimics the event horizon of a black hole. Tall deep tan head that dissipates surprisingly quickly. A good amount of lacing. Almost like cappuccino or hot chocolate. Frothy.
S - Roasted Malts, Licorice, Chocolate and Coffee. There is very little sign of that burnt aroma that characterizes so many imperial stouts. 
T - More bitter and fresh tasting than expected (a pleasant surprise). The alcohol is integrated well in the overall flavor of the beer. Dare I say that I was wanting something with a little more heat? Roasted malts are standing tall, with licorice and coffee battling it out for the remaining space on the taste buds. A wood taste is present but only mildly so. This is one tasty beverage. 
M - This is probably the smoothest, silkiest, and pleasant mouthfeels I have had. I didn't really know what the term "silky" meant when describing consistency until I had this beer. I gave this a perfect as it is the best I have had, but a little more carbonation would make this off the charts in my opinion.
D - A little heavy for a long night, but 11% keeps the volume consumed in check so that it doesn't become much of an issue. 1,177 charactersbifrostguard, Nov 22, 2008
4.49/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4I am reviewing the 2007 Vintage with the eager anticipation of getting the 2008 batch in my grasp.
Poured into a tulip glass. Pours ink black with a dark tan head. Heavy malt/chocolate and lesser alcohol aromas. Overall it's very sweet smelling. Nothing harsh. 
Nice middle-full body. Super roasted malt flavors, even in the little sips. You're really experiencing the malt first and the alcohol second. The licorice aspect kind of has a dry feel at first, but when you take a breath, you can taste it's sweetness, a very subtle difference from the alcohol. After letting it breath the sweeter attributes start to dominate. Everything as advertised is definitely there. This is a complex beer. It's hard to focus on one flavor at a time, but it's all there. 
I'm glad I held on to this for a year. I'll probably wait even longer with this year's batch. 855 characters100floods, Nov 21, 2008

2007 vintage poured into a snifter.
A- Jet black. Nice finger sized tan head formed and dissipated quickly. Some lace work stuck to the glass as the beer was consumed. 
S- The aroma only gets better as it warms up. Very distinct smell of chocolate, roasted malts, and molasses. 
T- Complex as all hell. Initially the chocolate and molasses dance on the tongue delivering a delicious flavor. This is capped off by distinct oak flavored, malt bitterness. Again this is a complex beer, even after a year. Really have to try this one for yourself. 
M- Thick and viscous. Very smooth and coats the tongue nicely. Just perfect.
D- Highly drinkable given the viscosity and the 11% abv. Drink this slowly and enjoy it for all it's worth.
Toby, thanks again! This was truly a great experience. The complexity this beer offered was amazing. I sipped this beer so slow and tried to drag it out all night solely for the reason that it was the only bottle I had. This beer really makes me want to move out to the Northwest.

Wax is cool but I sure hate trying to get it off the bottle.
This beer pours thick and black. No brown around the edges, just plain black. Nice thick tan head on top settles to about an inch and lingers nicely with lacing left behind. A very nice looking stout.
Aroma was there as soon as I popped the cap. There's certainly oak and red wine comes through too. Chocolate and roasted malts. Nice sweetness overall.
The flavor is super intense. It starts slightly sweet, some carmel, some dark chocolate. Then it hits hard with roasty bitterness that totally fills the mouth. Dark roasted coffee, dark bitter chocolate, and dark malts all at play here. Cherries, figs, and other dark fruits that make it wonder if a Belgian imperial stout might taste something like this.
It's super strong and the alcohol is only slightly hidden. The mouthfeel is good for the style in that it's smooth yet robust. I love the way it coats my mouth and throat in a wonderfully warming way.
Drinkability is great for something this big.
Overall a great Russian imperial stout. I can't wait to try the 2008.
---
2008 reserve
Poured into a highball glass, it has inky black color and a thin layer of light brown head. The head lingers briefly before settling but leaves a nice rim of lace around the glass.
Aroma has lots of vanilla and oak with roasted malt and hops in equal abundance.
Flavor is excellent, possibly better than the 2007. The dark malts are big but they aren't the center of attention as I remember. The hops seem fresher and more flavorful. The oak is certainly more noticeable. Malts contribute dark roast coffee, caramel, and dark chocolate while the oak aging gives it vanilla and possibly cherries.
Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy but bitterness (both from hops and malts) and the burn of 11% all come through.
Drinkability is excellent for the style and considering the strength of this awesome beer.
Overall very impressive and ceratinly worthy of its place on BA's top 10. 2,023 charactersGilGarp, Nov 18, 2008

2007 Reserve aged in Oak barrels.
Pours into my snifter dark and viscous, black with no light being able to penetrate, a large amount of tan head that fades slowly with some decent lacing on the glass.
Smell is mostly roasted malt, slight coffee aroma, very mild chocolate presence, some alcoholic heat even after almost a year.
Taste is a hit against the mouth, strong coffee-ish bitterness right up front and melds into a decent sweetness, prickly carbonation, the licorice is very evident (not much a fan of that though, but that's personal taste).
Certainly glad I've got the chance to try this beer and glad I got a couple more to age and see how it develops, I think maybe another year will do wonders. 949 charactersdeltatauhobbit, Nov 16, 2008
4.85/5  rDev +8.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Appearance - 2007 reserve - though it does exhibit a cola-ish color coming out of the bomber, in the glass it is as black as can be. A chocolatey mocha head forms up and leaves a thin veil of mocha lace around the glass.
Aroma - heady roasted malts, dark chocolate and coffee notes all in abundance. Maybe a little too much going on to really pick up the oak, at least in the smell. Great resilience though, a start befitting the buzz so far.
Taste - roasted malts, heavy coffee flavors here, espresso-like. Mild sweetness really helps enhance/offset the roast. Light anise and plenty of oak on the swallow. More sweetness with a mild but gaining bitterness as the palate clears. A light abv warmth puts a fine finish on this one as the oak, roasted malts, and intense coffee flavors meld so well. Lengthy finish, too, I find it to be an outstanding flavor overall.
Mouthfeel - a slight heaviness, plentiful body and a proper fullness in the mouth plus a fine silky smoothness. The carbonation is mellow but bubbly too.
Drinkability - worthy of the acclaim; I will cherish the remaining bottle or two for a few more years. 1,126 charactersbrewdlyhooked13, Nov 16, 2008

Appears a thick and viscous fifty year old motor oil black with a tan one inch head that gradually forms after the bubbles make their way through the thick liquid. No light is getting through this one. Not much lacing is left behind.
Aroma is full of coffee, chocolate, molasses, with some hints of vanilla, oak, and tart cherry.
The taste begins with an explosion of dark chocolate, molasses, vanilla, and some oakiness. Becomes more bitter during the swallow with more of a coffee presence, with the other flavors still lingering on subtely. 
Mouthfeel is nice and full, thick and velvety, smooth and creamy...I think that's enough.
So far this is probably the tastiest RIS I have tried to date. Just an explosion of delicious flavors. Get this beer! 855 charactersroadhouse, Nov 05, 2008

Pours a thick, disgustingly delicious blackness that can only be compared to a black hole. Nice 1.5" mocha colored head that fades slowly with a lot of sticking left behind :) 
Molasses but not DL molasses. I don't know much about the stuff but this is different than that. Fudgey with a nice whiskey nose [from the barrel]. Prunes or some other dark fruit is present and bringing in the rear of aromas.
Thick, rich and nasty (in a good way). This is one bad Larry! The thickness has an eruption of chocolate, molasses and whiskey oak. A very good and slightly bitter combo!
Feels nice and heavy but goes down so smooth you can't tell your about to be attacked by some serious flavors. A must pick up and try!

Pours black and completely opaque. A thin brown head on the pour. Retention was ok, but no real lacing.
The aroma is awesome, I was really in love. Huge roasty malts with big chocolate and coffee notes going on. It was a bit boozey, and slightly floral at times. Just incredible.
The taste is very good and I enjoyed it more and more with every sip. Burnt malts, chocolate and coffee taking the lead. The licorice is noticeable and plays a nice role balancing the vanilla. It's slightly sweet up front and then slightly bitter on the finish.
Mouthfeel is pushing full bodied with a nice moderate carbonation. 
Drinkability is high. It's got great flavor, great nose, and it's crazy easy to drink for 11%. Just loved it. 861 charactersGoliath, Oct 27, 2008
5/5  rDev +11.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 52007 Vintage. Picked up a single in Casper at Poplar Wine and Spirits. I have been waiting for quite some time to be in the perfect mood to enjoy what I have heard to be the definition of the style. 
A: Poured a viscous oily, black. Absolutely no light penetrates this beer, no garnet highlights, no color, just blackness, it practically sucks the light out of the room. After a vigorous pour a brown, head emerges, about two and a half inches thick that reduces down to about half an inch. Excellent strata of lacing as it reduces. Beautiful.
S: So many beautiful things going on, brown sugar, chocolate, raisins, figs, booze, licorice, whiskey, this one has definitely been in oak barrels. Cinnamon. Smells like dark breads. So many things going on, very hard to place everything. Coffee. Even some bitter, piney hops way underneath all the other things. This is delicious. 
T: Chocolatey, heavy coffee, very bitter, brown sugar, a lot of the smells are coming through in the taste, the hops are definitely a lot more present in the mouth than in the nose. Very citrusy in the hop department. Whiskey is in the taste as well, but a little more subdued than other whiskey aged beers. Very heavy on the dark chocolate malts. That really pops out all over the place. Aftertaste is off coffee and piney hops. The alcohol is quite subdued and hidden very well. This is absolutely fantastic and complex. The deepest beer I've ever enjoyed. 
M: Thick, rich, and malty, like a milkshake. Very heavy, not a lot of boozey burn. This is a one of a kind. Absolutely right on with the style. A great thick beer.
D: As heavy, bitter, rich, boozey and dark as this may be. It goes down very very easy. I wouldn't drink many of them but I could. This is a very fantastic beer, and I have not been let down in any way. This is a truly spectacular beer. Right on with everything this style is for. Perfect.

Scent of roasted malts, oats, chocolate, coffee, raisins with some oak and a hint of alcohol. There is a lot going on here, and even with a big complex scent this one managed to be balanced very well.
Taste of oak and roasted malts initially with some coffee immediately afterward. Bourbon, raisins, sugars and a hint of alcohol fill the flavor out extremely well. Finishes with roasted malts and oak, with a slight heat from the alcohol.
Mouthfeel is smooth, thick and heavy, charging its way through the mouth and down the throat elegantly.
An incredible beer, one of the very best I have ever had. I can't wait to get some more of this stuff. 732 characterspaco1029384756, Oct 20, 2008

looks a little thick, black as can be. a hard pour gets two fingers of deep brown foamy head that settles down into a thin layer on top. smells of booze and chocolate. the mouthfeel is fantastic. rich and thick, but still very creamy and velvety. it is surprisingly smooth and drinkable. the alcohol warms the chest a bit but the alcohol taste is not present. rich chocolate and carmel and coffee flavors with light hops floating in the background. very complex and well balanced. 504 charactersph2001, Oct 19, 2008
4.87/5  rDev +8.7%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5more pints than I will admit, on tap at the Eastsde Club in Olympia, WA, September '08...
I find I can barely wait to get back to my table, to finally taste what I have so long awaited.
The '07 bottles haven't yet aged into the magnificence of the '06 version, however '07 on tap blows either away. My current score would be 4.65 for '06 bottles, and 4.3 for '07 bottles.
Inky black beer slides slowly out of the glass and into my awaiting mouth. A dark tan head originally tops the rim of the glass and fades slowly to a ring by midglass, then only a whisper by the bottom. Time for another! Certainly no Dark Lord, but quite viscous nonetheless. Black is beautiful.
I can't decide on a 4, 4.5 or 5 for aroma. A few years ago I'd call this "perfect!"...now I've smelled most of the world's best imperial stouts, and find that while there is no fault here, the sheer complexity and strength of some of the others have raised the bar. This beer is lacking...at least compared to a rare few stouts on this earth. Does that mean I can't give it a 5?...Hmm. Chocolate abounds, some coffee here, thought it increased drastically as it warmed, ample molasses richness/sweetness. Barrel notes are light, but there.
There is no debate for flavor. As the 2nd sip hits my lips, any doubt is squashed: what was good from the bottle instantly vaults into my personal top 10 from the tap. Wow. Vanilla and chocolate, roasty and smooth, bitter and sweet. Everything is blended together in breathtaking fashion. Plenty of heavily carmelized/molasses notes, coffee again pretty strong but managing to remain blended in. Other than the body, the lack of alcohol warmth is the single biggest difference between the last several bottles I've consumed and this. There is nothing here to slow me down from sipping this monster until I collapse. I suppose I could rate the beer lower for being "dangerous" or some shit like that...but c'mon: "Too drinkable" is just something people without a designated driver" say!
Silky smooth in my mouth, not too thick, but far from stretched across my palate. My tongue luxuriates in the sensation, and I don't want to swallow...but I know there is a full keg left to be drained, making the sweet/roasty finish less saddening. Back to work!
My compliments to the Deschutes team. Can't wait until the next version, but until I then I'll take solace in my bottles. 2,386 charactersudubdawg, Oct 04, 2008

This is my first review and im just entering the beer snob scene so bear with me.
The beer lives up to its name with its pour, pure black with a reasonably decent head. 
Smell was amazing with hints of licorice and chocolate
Beer was incredibly smooth and easy on the palette, very easy to drink as well.
Despite being a beer snob for only a few weeks now I can see why this beer gets the respect that it does 829 charactersjamesm7485, Oct 04, 2008
4.9/5  rDev +9.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Pours dark coffee color to black with loads of dense tan head. Sticky lacing on the glass when the head finally recedes.
Aroma is almost smoky, with hints of chocolate, a nuttiness similar to hazelnut, butterscotch or toffee.
Taste of bitter chocolate followed with a roasty flavor, nuts, vanilla, some residual sweetness and a little oak in the finish.
Mouthfeel is creamy and rich, with decent levels of carbonation to break up such a big brew. Finish is both sweet and bitter.
Great beer. This was our last bottle of about 8 or so we tried over the last 10 months or so. We've also had the pleasure of having this on tap. Terrific stuff. 644 charactersBrewMonkey, Oct 01, 2008

4.58/5  rDev +2.2%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.52007 edition. Poured from a 22oz bottle into a pint glass. It was pitch black even against a strong light. It was very thick and poured almost like motor oil and DL. It had a huge dark brown head that stuck around as a thick foam throughout the session. No visible carb but tons of lacing.
The aroma was heavy on coffee and roasted and chocolate malts. Lots of sweetness as well. Good strong aroma and really set the stage for what came next. The taste pretty closely followed the aroma. Nice bitterness from the coffee and roasted malts. Touch of smokiness as well. Starts off really smooth with a touch of watery and then the real flavor hits with the bitter bit then fads right at the end so as not to linger too long. I was pleasantly surprised that very little of the oak aging came thru. I as not a fan of that trend and was worried that this one would be affected by it. It wasn't and it tasted great. The mouthfeel was thick and creamy.
Overall, an excellent beer that is worthy of the high ranking and hype. Most highly recommend. Get your hands on some now! 1,069 charactersTexIndy, Sep 29, 2008

a - not much head. The blackest black!
s - oak. Whiskey, raisins? Rich and malty, black molassis. Some beers you can smell even before your pour - this is one. Very very rich aroma and it's pretty damn cold too. Vanilla and Oak. Boozy, whiskey, heaven.
t - how to explain. Aroma is so impressive, the taste is there too. Super rich, COFFEE, some sweetness, roasted ROASTED. Nicely balanced regarding the oak and whiskey. Bitter at the end, but not too much. There is licorice if you look for it, in the aftertaste and mouthfeel. 
m - thick. Bitter, but not so much from hops but from the Charcoal-ish-ness. 
d - f-ing great. MORE MORE MORE!!
Really, really top rate, A+. I have another and I would like to wait 2 years to see.. but we'll see what happens. 776 charactersjojox, Sep 23, 2008

As expected, it poured a super dark brown/black with a gorgeous, very dark brown 2 inch head. Minimal lacing.
Smelled of heavily roasted coffee, dry chocolate, vanilla and black licorice when it was freshly poured. Interestingly, the smell changed as it sat and warmed. 
Tastes like a wonderful combination of black licorice, molasses, charred malts, freshly brewed coffee and trailing with rich, dark chocolates. Wow... Mother, may I have another?
This is an intensely flavored, moderately complex and full-bodied beer. If you're a fan of vanilla, molasses, licorice, semi-sweet chocolate and coffee, then you'll need to try this one. There's a shitload of crafting mastering in this one, what a treat! 906 charactersbeachbum1975, Sep 20, 2008

A: This one rivals Dark Lord for the darkest beer I have ever seen. Held up to a light, the Abyss is just that - a labyrinth of darkness squeezed into a bottle. It has a one finger head that is deep mocha brown and lasts a while. The viscous brew laces and clings like glue to the side of the glass.
S: Complexity is the key here. Tons of roasted malts hit you right in the face. A tad of whiskey shows up, but just slightly so it is not overpowering. Dark cocoa and dark fruits - Figs and raisins show up slightly.
T: The most complex beer I have tasted without the viscosity of syrup. Chocolate covered cherries surround your mouth while roasted malts soaked in slight whiskey engulf your taste buds. The coffee flavors finish nicely in the end as well combined with a nice vanilla-malty-nutty flavor.
Overall, this is perhaps my favorite beer to date due to the reasons aforementioned. It comes with a slight punch to it, so I believe this one is best shared! Grab it if you get the chance! 1,124 characterstreyrab, Sep 18, 2008
4.18/5  rDev -6.7%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 3.5Bottle purchased from Colorado Liquor Mart and imported to California.
Appearance: Pitch black. Creamy tan head presides over the top. Poot-like, and very appropriate for members of the San Francisco DRA.
Smell: Molasses, coffee, soy sauce, and smoke. Very intriguing.
Taste: Same flavors as the smell, along with seriously roasted, burnt maltiness, campfire charcoal (even though I don't know what the hell that tastes like, it seems like it would taste a little like the Abyss), and grilled steak. Very little sweetness, and the finish is fairly dry. Upon closer inspection, one notices some hops camouflaged somewhere in there too.
Mouthfeel: Trump tight. In other words, awesome. Thick, creamy, choclate-shaky, with ample carbonation to support it.
Drinkability: Such a powerful, high alcohol stout that there's no way you could guzzle this. But why would you want to? That said, Abyss should have also been available in smaller bottles. Yes, we all enjoy sharing a bottle of tasty beer. But if it's a week night and your wife doesn't like good stouts, you end up having to waste some or get hung over. 1,111 characterswaltonc, Sep 18, 2008

2007 RESERVE
Served in a snifter
Thanks to my roommate Mel for bringing this one back from Oregon.
I decided to save this gem for review #350.
The beer poured a viscous, absolute pitch black with a thick, creamy, one-finger, cocoa colored head. The head stuck around longer than I have ever seen on a beer of this magnitude, eventually fading to a bubbly film. Thick sheets of lacing coated the lower half of the glass and spotty drips trickled down from the top with each sip. This was unquestionably the most impressive looking Russian imperial stout I have ever seen.
The aroma was dark and intense. Super roasty, oaky and bourbony with semi-sweet notes of vanilla, licorice and molasses. As the beer warmed, the booziness became more apparent.
The taste was deep, dark and complex. Ultra roasty, oaky and coffee-like up front. Somewhat burnt. Licorice came through in the center along with notes of bakers chocolate. The dry, lingering finish was a mix of intense, piney and resiny hops, burnt malts and bourbon. As the beer warmed, the hoppy bitterness on the finish became even more intense (almost a bit overwhelming), as did the alcohol presence.
The mouthfeel was ultra creamy, frothy and smooth. Super thick and rich. The beer felt like a blanket on my tongue.
This is a fierce Russian imperial stout that definitely lies on the more extreme end of the spectrum for the style. With a bit more aging, this stuff could be amazing. 1,485 charactersDamian, Sep 14, 2008

Pours a nice black color with a caramel tan colored head of ¼", that dies down to a thin lacy head. Slight legs on glass (nice for a beer).
Smell is of dark coffee and burnt sugars. Taste is very nice. Not over powering on any facet: Chocolate/liquorice notes are accentuated by mild woody tones. Coffee finish lingers a bit, but it is quite pleasant. Fine bubbles are nice and give the beer a good mouth feel Even with the high (11%) alcohol, this is not a hot beer. 541 charactersmattster, Sep 10, 2008

Smell: the smell was a wonderful combination of coffee, chocolate, brown sugar, and a hint of black licorice.
Mouth feel: very pleasant. No complaint what so ever. It was a medium thickness of a liquid. It was definitely one of those beers so smile with every sip, and you want every sip to last through the night.
Taste: wonderful, every smell you intake is encompassed in the beer it is wonderfully balanced with a bit of hops and creamy malts. Just in a word...perfect.
Drink ability: like with every time I have a good beer to review I want one now. Sad it only comes once a year, like Christmas, but definitely could have one everyday through out the day. Bit alcoholic of me I know 809 charactersAimstatus, Sep 09, 2008
4.68/5  rDev +4.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Appears a pitch black body with a large thicket of mocha tan head. By the way thanks to SurlyDuff my old roomie Geoff, from Morgantown, WV for sending his local breweries finest in my direction. By the way Geoff's screen name has nothing to due with Surly Brewing Company I believe it's solely based on his love for The Simpsons, as a shout out to Duff Man. By the way the head dwindles slowly forming chunky sporadic bands of lacing around my chalice, very nice.
	Aroma contains dark roasted malts including anise, dark chocolate more of a bittersweet baker's chocolate note. Warming vanilla and oak barrel aging effects flowing strong but with some finesse. I'm not crazy about the oak barrel aging frenzy that's going on in the craft beer movement at this time, however this blended version brings enough of those characteristics without overshadowing the actual beer. Deep alcohol with fruit undertones doing this bee much justice. 
	Flavors are great, much more complex and straight forward than the aroma was. Soothing alcohol burn weighs heavy among the waves of dark chocolate and mild sweetness provided by underlying plum and fig sweetness. Herbal hops barely play a role here with a touch of bitterness, charred oak and vanilla with a touch of whiskey blend beautifully into one massive American Imperial Stout. Some coffee hints here but nothing blatant a lot more dark chocolate from the dark roasted malt character than anything else.
	Mouthfeel is full bodied carbonation is timid amongst the large bodied brew, but definitely ample enough to stand up to it. Textures of bitter chocolate leave a drying bitterness over the palate, charred oak makes it nearly smokey but nothing like a true Rauchbier. Solid through and throught definitely silky presence to the overall feel. 
	Drinkability is effortless the glass will drain before your ready for it, it's easy to make it through a review without ever even stopping to take a note or complete a sentence. This brew kept my nose in the glass and my palate in touch with the contents of this awesome wax sealed bottled from the left coast. Another amazing experience I can carry with me in my beer journeys, thanks again Geoff! 2,194 charactersWVbeergeek, Sep 08, 2008

A: Thick and vicious, nearly black with a single-finger, tight creamy brown head that settles to a blanked and leaves polka dot lacing patterns all over the place when swirled or sipped. 
S: Smoke/smoked meat, charred wood, tad of licorice.
T: Very similar to the nose: smoke, roasty bitter chocolate, sort of a palate-coating woody finish. There's also this subtle underlying presence of molasses throughout. 
M: Thick, creamy and velvety. A perfect example of how I love my RISs. This baby is smooth. Mild carbonation. Perfect 10 here. 
D: 11% ABV is masked really well. The velvet (almost biscuit-like) texture and smokey/sweet flavor could easily pull me through a bomber and a half, tho I'd probably be knocked the hell out if I finished two. Awesome representation of a RIS. Was not let down by this one. It's not the best beer I ever had, but its up there with the best of them. 966 characterskasper, Sep 07, 2008

4.92/5  rDev +9.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5This beer pours a thick, oily, black color. The head is half and inch in height, dark tan in color, and recedes slowly into a small cap of lacing. The aroma is of roasted malt, cream, graham crackers, dark chocolate, and hints of oak. The taste is burly, and bold without being over-the-top. Roasted malt, graham cracker, and cream open up the taste, leading into chocolate, and oak in the finish. There is a lingering roasted malt bitterness in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is full bodied, with appropriately low carbonation, and a velvety texture. This is a world class Russian Imperial Stout. I could certainly drink this again. 632 charactersKarlHungus, Aug 27, 2008

Pours a thick jet black brew with a dark tan head that had a good amount of retention. The aroma was sweet and had a touch of chocolate and some sweet oaky vanilla notes.
The taste is very intense with a rich dark carmely sweetness blended in with the roasty, coffeelike tastes of the dark malt. Smooth flavor overall this beer finishes with a nice hint of oak and bourbon sweetness that segues into a warming finish. Very rich and complex yet neatly comprised this beer is an excellent example of the Imperial Stout style.
The mouthfeel was rich and full yet not too thick. 
Overall an excellent beer that i will be adding to my cellar. 650 charactersRenoZymurgist, Aug 22, 2008
4.46/5  rDev -0.4%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4The Bottle is stately, simple, with a wax sealed cap. The label declares its vintage (2007). The Wax is a bit tricky to cut off at first, but soon comes off from around the cap. The beer pours slowly, with a viscosity befitting to its molasses heritage. The result in my glass is a deep brown opaque beer, with a brown head that clings nicely to the side of the glass. The smell of dark chocolate, and the mild molasses is countered by a woody and smoky odour. 
The flavour is strong, muscling through anything, with a tastes of baker's chocolate, liquorice, with a mild to moderate hint of coffee. The woody, smoky flavour really comes through pleasantly, with just enough presence to add additional direction to this beer. The beer drinks smoothly, with moderate carbonation that doesn't sting, and a oily finish that clings to the mouth. This is really a beer to have with a desert such as a cheese cake, or perhaps as a desert in its own right. The ethanol remains hidden under the malts and tastes of roast throughout, making it very easy to drink more than you intended. An amazing beer from a quality brewery. Deschutes has really outdone themselves with this offering. 1,177 charactersmrkc, Aug 18, 2008

Smell - Dark chocolate cocoa, wood, light coffee.
Taste - Burnt wood is the first thing that I taste, followed again by dark chocolate cocoa. Coffee starts coming out a little more, as does the licorice at the very end.
Mouthfeel - HEAVY and chalky, perfect amount of carbonation.
Drinkability - This one takes a minute to adjust to, but its fantastically chocolaty and rich. I don't know if this is as easily drinkable as some, but its smooth enough to sip effortlessly. 660 characterssevopie, Aug 18, 2008

Pours a sludgy midnight black into the glass, massive and dense mocha-colored head fades very slowly, leaves a healthy amount of lacing in the glass. Smell is like a charred campfire log, tons of scorched wood on the nose, spicy alcohol, molasses and extremely dark and bitter chocolate. Taste follows right along, but with some lighter/mellower milk chocolate flavors and a faint plum/dark fruit flavor. Moutfheel is incredible...thick and chewy, but silky, alcohol coats and warms the inside of the mouth, tons of lingering charred flavors, and a faint coffee aftertaste. Carbonation is completely spot-on for the style. This is an absolutely brilliant beer, and I'm so pleased I got the chance to try it.

What started of a deep black with 1 cm head quickly dissipated to a brooding black liquid with but a few black bubbles. This beer looks like a Daniel Plainview wet dream. A quick whiff triggers the flow of neurotransmitters back towards my brain telling me I'm smelling dark chocolate with hints of molasses, burnt coffee, and dark fruits. The first sip provides a lovely amount of chocolate with a syrup lightly drizzled over. It coats the mouth quite well and leaves me wanting more of it's creamy, but still chewy wonder. As it warms hints of bourbon, incredibly small hints mind you, come through. I could drink this for quite some time. It is definitely a sipper. I feel like this would be a beer served in the coldest portion of the afterlife and you would be surrounded by only the finest artists discussing each others work and mocking every beer snob that says this beer isn't rare enough for his palate. 1,037 charactersCedromar, Aug 15, 2008

A: Big brown head settled into a layer of brown bubbles. Opaque black body. Nice cascading when first poured. An oily looking sheen left on the glass after each sip.
S: Plenty of roasted malt, dark chocolate, and a milder coffee and oaky presence. Alcohol became more prevalent as the beer warmed.
T: Very well balanced. Loaded with roasted malt and sweet molasses and toffee flavors. Bitter chocolate and coffee notes balance out the sweetness. Just enough alcohol to let you know it's there, but never overwhelming.
M: Medium bodied. Very smoothe. A slight oiliness coats the mouth and tongue.
D: Awesome beer. One of the best. Very smoothe and easy drinking. 764 charactersJerzdevil1116, Aug 13, 2008

Dark rich smoke, oak, lavish and layered. But extremely balanced. I'm guessing the acidity and alc just marry up perfectly with the complexity and strength this brew posesses. Intensity but elegant. Could also age this brew for several years. A bit of sweet but almost dry. Oily cigar white smoke, deep and rich coco and coffee but still subtle. $14+ is what this retails for I guess?

4.34/5  rDev -3.1%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5This one pours a very very dark brown with some light passing through on the fringe. It also has a wonderful chocolate-brown head to it that recedes fairly quick and leaves no lacing. The aroma is wonderful. It is dark and roasty, yet with a sweet chocolaty undertone, along with a slight hint of anise. The alcohol is very well masked. 
The roast is quite powerful on the taste and definitely is the most prevalent flavor, and it seems to give the beer a slight astringency. The sweet chocolate is still there though, preventing the roast from being overpowering. The alcohol isn't quite as well masked as the aroma indicated, and there is some decent hop bitterness throughout. It is definitely both balanced and flavorful. It has a medium-full body to it, but the carbonation is a bit low. Overall, I'm not sure if it quite lives up to its reputation, but is still an excellent beer. 887 charactersASymon13, Aug 02, 2008

Dark chocolate, smokiness, roasted flavors, vanilla, considerable hop presence, slight oak, dark fruits, slight booze, & a bitter coffee finish. licorice? Lots going on here. I could find things all night. I just might.
Smooth and creamy with mild carbonation & lingering taste of the above.
As far as barrel aged 11% stouts go the drinkability is off the charts. Easy drinking & yummy. Having said that you might want to share the bottle.
Well I liked this. Look forward to buying more of the next release. Between Obsidian, Abyss, Black Butte, & Black Butte XX, Deschutes is making some top shelf stouts & porters. Recognize. 1,110 charactersbbothen, Jul 27, 2008

Dark, really dark, thick looking. The head was wonderful: creamy, large, and dark tan. Looked like chocolate milk on top. Aromas of coffee roast and sweet chocolate. The first sip was hard to get to through the large head but once I got there, it was worth it. Sweetness up front followed by a roatiness and slight bitter to balance this full bodied beer. Just enough carbonation to make is easy to palate. All the hype of this beer is true. Definitely a good one! Easy to drink but watch out, 11% abv. 538 charactersbrewjones, Jul 24, 2008

When you think about the ingredients in craft brews, it is generally: malt, water, yeast and hops. Sure adjuncts come in from time to time, and you may get another amazing ingredient added, like Stone's 12th Anniversary's use of chocolate. But, at the end of the day, we're talking about a very small palate of ingredients. But ahh the array of things that those ingredients can do to your palate.
Herein a perfect example: The Abyss! 
Dark as night, this pours like liquid chocolate. Thick and rich, it fills the snifter with something that looks so viscous, but is oh so smooth... 
It smells of chocolate and licorice, roastey and toastey. It begs to be drunk, but you can't stop sniffing. Pass it along, person to person and invite them to revel in the joy you know you will receive upon first taste.
And then you sip... it fills the palate...chocolate and coffee immediately come through. You think about the ingredients and all you can see is the dark malts, how dark they must have been to produce this. And wow, it's balanced too. It's 11% but not cloying or sweet, not alcoholic or biting. The balance they achieved with the perfect amount of bittering and flavoring hops. There are no flaws in this.
My wife called it dessert in a glass. Not because it was sweet, but because it felt like a reward to drink. The snifter seems too small. For, while you can only sip this beer, you can not STOP sipping it. Each take brings you closer to the time when it will be gone, but beyond savoring it, you have no interest in taking your time.
Well done, Deschutes. You just make good beers. Mazeltov! 1,619 characterssupermanjace, Jul 19, 2008
4/5  rDev -10.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4This bottle is vintage 2007. Just to set the record straight, I'm not a huge fan of imperial stouts, and I usually prefer ones that are flavored with espresso.
With that being said, the Abyss is definitely one of the better "regular" Impy Stouts I've tasted. It pours with a slight head that lingers until the finish. It smells of roasty/chocolate malt with coffee-ish notes. The flavor has similar characteristics, but with some dried, cocoa in there as well. It's not too sweet and is fairly balanced for the strength and style. The body isn't as heavy as I thought it might be considering the strength. Also, the barrel-aged character is well-hidden. More often than not, a barrel-aged beer tastes heavily of oak/bourbon/etc. Not so in this brew. It must be due to the fact (like the bottle says) that only 33% was aged in barrels. This is definitely the way I wish other brewers would incorporate their barrel aging. I liked this brew quite a lot so I can only imagine what other impy-stout-loving BA's might think of it.

Pours a very dark reddish brown, compared to some RIS's it's far from black. Has a lovely dark tan head of persistent fine bubbles.
Very subtle nose with just a slight bit of roastiness and caramel aroma.
Great flavor, very complex with loads of low roasted malts and some caramel.
Stimulating hop bitterness, has a light mouthfeel in a good way. Slightly oily.
Drinkability is great. Very smooth and light, goes down easy. 540 charactersBattleRoadBrewer, Jul 17, 2008

Aroma started with a little smoke followed by cocoa, cola and vanilla. The initial flavor was Espresso. Bourbon, brandy and charcoal presented themselves afterward. Mouthfeel could be described as luxurious: a creamy full body with moderate carbonation levels.
The Abyss has earned its reputation. Deschutes delivers an impressive imperial stout. Special thanks to NitroGen for sending this to me. Cheers! 517 charactersfrazbri, Jul 16, 2008

 Jet-black color, totally opaque, thick, syruppy pour with a one-finger deep, mocha brown crown, settles thick and creamy but with plenty of bubbles within. Dissipates slow but still looks pretty active. Very sticky lacing, hangs around.
 The aroma is no doubt reminding me of chocolate brownies with fruit on the side. black berries, very deep fruity aroam rides just under the sweet, thick malt scent. Prunes, raisins, charcoal, fudge pops, rollo's, hearty grains and wet-earth rounds it out.
 This is a highly sweet and chocolaty malt flavor that whacks the palate hard on the ass! chocolate-covered cherries, mocha-vanilla coffee, honey and caramel currents run together. Heavy, thick, bold feel with a balance achieved by herbal, dried herbs and a bitter, peppery hop. Dark fruit flavor's pop out later with black berries and cherries melding togather with the fudgy chocolate malt. A smokey wood and grains edge and heat that is agressive but not sharp pushes the attention away from sweet flavor's for a bit and adds complexity and depth. High grade complexity.
 This is almost as full and heavy as it gets, only Bell's Expedition Stout is thicker in my estimation. almost chalky.
 A big beast of a brew for sure. 1,280 charactersGratefulBeerGuy, Jul 16, 2008
4.33/5  rDev -3.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 422 oz. bomber bottle with black wax covering up the cap. This was their 2007 edition.
I decided to pour this bad boy into a Great lakes Christmas Ale Snifter. What came out of the bottle was thick black oily beer. It's another one of those dark oily beers that can be easily mistaken for crude oil. On top of this beer was a good 1/2 an inch in height mocha/dark tan colored head of foam. This head of foam had nice retention that left behind foamy mocha rings and a few mocah spots of lace here and there.
I was surprised to find out that the aroma was heavy on the roasted espresso beans. I would have guessed roasted malts or bourbon, but it instead went the roasted esprsso bean route. There wasn't all that much after the espresso beans. All my nose could find was dark roasted malts, a hint of dark chocolate, and some dark fruits hiding in the background. I guess it was hard for all the other aromas to break through the thick espresso bean wall.
While the aroma consisted heavly on the roasted esprsso beans, the taste went another way. This time the taste went the many different roasted flavor route. The esprsso beans were still there, but only in a small amount. The taste was heavly dark and roasted with dark roasted malts, bitter dark chocolate, roasted espresso beans, a hint of black licorise, and ends with a touch of alcohol. I would have thought that since this was barrel aged, there would be some oak or bourbon in the taste, but I guess all the dark roasted flavors covered them up. Not only did the dark roasted flavors cover up the bourbon and oak, but it also controlled the amount of alcohol that decided to show up. Noting short of being a great dark roasted flavored beer!
It you couldn't tell already, this is clearly a full bodied beer. This full bodied beer featured a full flavored dark roasted aftertaste (no duh!) of dark roasted malts, roasted espresso beans, bitter dark chocolate, and a small touch of alcohol. Not too much alcohol where it would make this beer boozy, but just the right amount of alcohol. I should probablt thank the dark roasted flavors for that! No oak or bourbon in here either. That means that all the dark roasted flavors kicked out the oak and bourbon completely out of this beer.
Big thanks to Donnie2112 to sharing this bottle. There's no way I could have possibly polished off an entire bottle all by myself without taking a nap in the middle of drinking this thick dark brew. It's a great barrel aged dark roasted beer without any of the oak or bourbon flavors. It would have been nice to find a little bit of those 2 flavors, but this taste really didn't need them all that much because there were plenty of dark roasted flavors to take their place. Thanks again Donnie2112 for sharing this kick ass beer! 2,778 charactersAltBock, Jul 13, 2008

lusciously rich and rummy, just a bit of chocolate on the nose, some coffee too
starts off sweet, rolls into a toasty flavor. the overall flavor is somewhere between chocolate and coffee. But I taste more coffee then chocolate. Style wise call this a mocha stout
mouthfeel is lightly carbonated and heavy in body, finishes much cleaner then I normally expect from a RIS. Nice!
as far as this style goes it's definately drinkable I could keep drinking this stuff. I had it on tap at Uber Tavern in Seattle and found this to have a much more chocolate then coffee profile. That said I'm not gonna give it a perfect in drinkability because I don't think I could drink more then two of these. 763 charactersDonnie2112, Jul 12, 2008

Wasatch hooked me up with a bottle of this highly sought brew, thanks again!
Pours an ominous, charcoal black..a thick, tan head rests on top and slowly recedes to leave streams of lacing in it's wake.
Aroma of slow-roasted coffee & dark Bavarian chocolate malt.
Flavor consists of a delicious combination of sweet molasses, burnt caramel, bitter dark chocolate, vanilla, licorice, and a touch of dark fruits.
Creamy texture rests upon a full body and allows this drink to dish out all the flavors to each individual tastebud.. succulent.
A standout Imperial stout for sure, and certainly one worth tracking down. 629 charactershero27, Jul 07, 2008

See a review of the Fricking Frog in Las Vegas for more info. This beer was amazing! It reminded me of the first time I drank a stout and felt amazed. The appearance is a blck dark beer with a dark brown sugar colored head. The smell was deceiving, but extremely malty. I say deceiving because it was served to me a bit too cold, so the aromas have not woke up. The taste is strong, strong and more strong. It is truely an experience in that it is strange how great it feels in your mouth. There is heat from the high alcohol, but balance of the malt, and very little bittering from hops, but none is needed. It is like a warm blanket that has been soaked in sugar and coffee is wrapped around your tongue. Is is necessary to say this is heavy? The drinkability is great because all you need is one. 889 characterslapbplayr, Jul 06, 2008

Beer poured black as night with a very nice brown head. Nose is sweet mocha, coffee, and those wonderful northwest hops. Taste is perfection, a fusion of mocha, coffee, chocolate, hints of black licorice and molasses. It is well balanced as everything blends nicely into a coffee hop finish. Mouthfeel is perfection as well, a full bodied beer that is the ultimate in creamy smoothness. Drinkability is perfection as well. The alcohol makes a small appearance in the belly upon the first sip but other than that it is not noticeable. I always wondered if a bigger badder version of Obsidian Stout would be a perfect beer given how good that is. I am here to tell you it is pretty darn close! Must try for the Imperial Stout fan! 817 charactersarizcards, Jul 04, 2008

Reviewing an '07 vintage of this one today, which I got off LiquidSolutions before it went out of business. It's been sitting in my cellar for a year and change now, and I suppose has to be 2.5 years old at this point. And it's drinking beautifully. Drinkability gets half a point bump for being so damn inviting. Unsure how much better it will get, or even - now that I'm contemplating it further - if it may have peaked very recently. Either way, I wouldn't object to anyone with an '07 cracking it now.
***
Enjoyed at a tasting on 06/18 w/ fellow BAer proteus93. This beer was actually courteous of proteus - thanks!! Poured into an Ommegang chalice.
Appearance: An abyss, fittingly. Black as night with a deep, brown head that is huge, creamy, permanent. No light escapes through this one (we checked with my laser pointer, just to be sure). Retention is actually great for a 11% abv beer, as is the lacing. Stellar.
Aroma: Probably the most complex smelling beer I've ever stuck my nose into. A number of woody notes are definitely present - an earthy oak note, vanilla phenols, and some wood toastiness are all present up front. But that's just the beginning - highly toasted but not burnt malts lend the impression of coffee, toffee, and bitter chocolate. Soy sauce, salt, wholesome oats, licorice, some fruity esters, and light, wafting alcohol are also all pleasant. Simply outstanding.
Taste: Much of what's in the nose, and that's a good thing. Highly roasted malts come through as baker's chocolate, highly roasted coffee, and molasses. Dark, complex fruity sugars come through at the apex of the sip - figs, prunes, raisins. The anise is there, but it's not distracting or dominating, which is good, as its not my favorite flavor. Despite all this complex sweetness, however, it's well-balanced with a strong but understated spicy hop presence, stronger than many RISs. There's alcohol, too, obviously, but it's smooth and warming, not coarse and hot.
Mouthfeel: Full and creamy, luscious and smooth, but with a surprisingly solid carbonation base. Strangely enough, I have no notes on the bubble profile. Does this mean it was too good for words? Or so bad I was speechless? Or that this was the 6th beer of the evening, five of them over 9% abv, and I was too gone to even properly say the words "bubble structure," much less write cogently about it? I think it's probably the last one there.
Drinkability: Eminently drinkable, but at 11% abv it's obviously a sipper, and a beer to respect. Not overwhelmingly sweet, either, like many other RISs - this one would go well on its own or with a savory dessert.
What an outstanding beer. A new top-10er for me. A delicate yet bold, complex but defined beer, and definitely one to be savored. If you see it, buy every last one. 2,820 charactersCrellMoset, Jun 29, 2008

A: jet black, no doubt about the color here. no light passing through whatsoever. thick and somewhat fluffy mocha colored head with decent sticky lacing.
S: smells of sweet malt up front, followed by chocolate, coffee, creamy marshmallow, somewhat earthy and burnt essence.
T&M: thick bodied (almost syrupy) with medium carbonation. initial flavors are a peppery and spicy hop taste, roasted and burnt coffee, chocolate, dark sugary malts, slightly vanilla (or marshmallow) and a wooded/earthyness. evened out by a warming boozy taste. 
D: this is a rich, full bodied beer with relatively high ABV. Almost a meal in a glass, but a delicious one at that! 2-3 at most in a given session would be appropriate. 783 charactersjulian, Jun 29, 2008

Black with reddish mahogany edges that were visible in bright light. A solid cap of light brown foam appeared after the pour and settled into a thick ring and skim of bubbles after a few minutes. Lots of streaky and spotty lacing. Roasty, malty aroma with notes of smoke, licorice, toffee and chocolate, burnt and oaky, with a bit of alcohol. Very nice. Starts out sweet with a bit of fruit character, then moves on to a rich maltiness, lots of toffee and chocolate. Roast and licorice added complexity, along with some vanilla and bourbon. Solid pine bitterness and flavour was more evident towards the end. Charred wood and burnt bitterness in the finish. Full bodied, but not heavy. Carbonation was well integrated, fine bubbles, and on the low side. Significant alcohol warmth without hotness. Very drinkable for a big stout. Good stuff. 904 charactersDrJay, Jun 29, 2008

4.13/5  rDev -7.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5One of the highlights of the BIF Race 2007 Sinister package from Eyedrinkale, The Abyss (2007 Reserve) came in a 22 oz. bomber with neck dipped in black wax. Luckily it was the pretty soft and came off without much struggle to allow me to get to the real attraction. The beer poured out absolutely black in color as expected, and holy crap did it have a dark head. The color of the head was like chocolate syrup at first, and as it died down to foam, it revered back to khaki. The smell was roasted coffee, but it did not seem overdone. The roasted aroma was mild enough to allow some light hops to poke through. The much anticipated first sip was quite dry and the astringency made my cheeks pucker. As I adjusted to the graininess, chocolate, toffee, malted milk balls, vanilla beans, oak shavings, and black coffee made themselves known. This was a big, bruising, hefty stout, and needed to be approached with the respect it deserved. Not very easily approachable, unless you already know you want something like it. 1,019 charactersrajendra82, Jun 13, 2008

Taste is sweet and complex, with more molasses, some chocolate and coffee, and definite pronounced vanilla.

Aroma of chocolate, molasses, and plenty of alcohol. Taste is huge on coffee, with some chocolate, dark fruits, and alcohol underneath. As it warms I can definitely taste some vanilla from the oak. Mouthfeel is quite thick and creamy. Awesome. This is obviously a sipper, so drinkability isn't incredibly high.

If you're a hophead, you'll probably like this Imperial Stout. There a big load of hops in this beer, which creates a bittersweet sensation between hops and cocoa. Smooth and not too heavy in the mouth. Sweet upfront, then spicy hops come in and knock down the palate. The alcohol almost gets lost in there. After the hop smackdown, it clears up and bring s in a rewarding aftertaste of brownie mix chocolate. Sweetens as warms. For what it is, it's pretty drinkable. I enjoyed this immediately after I got off work, as my workplace sits next door to the establishment I consumed this at. 671 charactersDoubleJ, Jun 02, 2008
4.21/5  rDev -6%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Sampled through Monsone and Brews N Tunes 3 BIF.
Another one of my long sought after beers that I had not really expected to see for a long time.
Super dark clear brown beer that you can see through barely when your pour it. In the glass this is a light proof black beer with a small thick brown colored head that lasts.
Smell is sweet and spicy with a strong molasses aroma. Actually the molasses is INTENSE in this beer and it smells a great deal like a molasses cookie. Blackberry brandy in coffee aroma makes up most of the additional scent. Faint chocolate but the other aromas almost completely hide it.
The taste starts out neutral sweet and smooth with a strong STRONG coffee aftertaste. Chocolate and a little berry after the initial hit of coffee. That's about it for flavor strong coffee with a bit of berries and chocolate.
Silky mouthfeel.
Minor amount of harshness in sips 3-6 but after that is smoothes out. Quite silky in the mouth it almost has the feel of the high fat hot chocolate made with half and half from scratch. Really more of a sipping beer, I think a six-pack of seven ounce bottles of this would be ideal. 1,141 charactersZorro, Jun 01, 2008

4.7/5  rDev +4.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours an opaque darkness with a huge foamy dark tan head that fades slowly, with sheets of lacing in its wake. The smell is really unique. At first i thought it was going to be overly roasted. Coffee, oats, chocolate, barrel aged vanilla and something that i couldn't put my finger on, until i peeked - and that would be the licorice. Adequately carbonated, the mouth feel is full bodied. As it warms the mouth reveals more and more of the 11% ABV...and that's a good thing!! The flavor is incredibly unique too. The best i can offer is that i get a wonderful rich oat-y anise and java thing that coats and lingers on and on. I'm pleasantly surprised that its far less roasted than i originally anticipated.

4.82/5  rDev +7.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to raiser for the opportunity to try this one... ended up splitting it with one of the owners of the local beer joint and distributor.
A: It don't get much darker than this. Ink black, totally opaque. A light tan head, decent retention... a nice little ringing of lace
S: Anise, vanilla bean, chocolate, and French roast coffee. Quite nice smelling.
T: Notes of tobacco (though very mild), rich anise and molasses. Oakiness, caramel, dark chocolate. This is a nice balance of flavours on my palate. A bitter, cocoa flavour on the finish. A very, very nice tasting brew. 
M: Very rich, creamy and full.. a little bit of a fizzle of carbonation which adds a nice extra something to the body. 
D: Amazing drinkability, especially considering the alcohol content. There's no sign of it, and it gets nicer as it warms, which makes sipping slowly a bit more rewarding. 874 charactersProteus93, May 29, 2008
4.62/5  rDev +3.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to BigJtrucker and Largadeer for the chance to try this brew.
A - Pours opaque black tah forms a thin mocha colored head that hands around for a second before disolving leaving no lace.
S - Amazing. Dark chocolate, deep espresso, dark fruity esters, surgary molassas, and a touch of burnt wood. Very nice!
T - Does not disipoint. Dominated by espresso with touches of chocolate and caramel, roasted grains and dark bitter fruits are present. Oak and bourbon do not overwelhm this brew, they are there just to compliment the overall complexity of the beer. Again very nice.
M - Good chewy thickness one would come to expect from a beer like this and with a great balance of carbonation. There is no alcohol burn here like I expected there would be, and the heavy coffee and chocolate are not as sticky as I thought they would be. Very nice on the palate given the gravity of the brew.
D - Great brew!! Very well crafted and balanced. Wouldn't mind having more of this beer if given the chance. 999 charactersturbine2475, May 28, 2008
4.25/5  rDev -5.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Abyss from a 2007 bottle and poured into a Brandy Snifter.
A - dark black with a thin mocha colored head that barely sits on the edge. The beer has a dark reflective sheen to it as well. There was hardly any head at all and not a trace of lacing to be found as well. There was a thick and sticky aspect of the beer that let the beer coat the sides of the glass but that only stayed on for a few seconds as well.
S - Smells of a deep burnt and smoky malt that wafts up. I was really surprised by how smoky and roasted the nose was. Had that almost beef jerky like smell that dominates some beers of the style. There were also loads of thick dark chocolate that came to me as the beer warmed up even more from cellar to room temp. The smoky aspect really seemed to dominate the nose of the beer and that seemed to take away from the subtle aspects that were trying to make themselves noticed. There was a light hint of caramel, vanilla, oak and even black berries that seemed to come out a bit more as the beer reached high temps.
T - At first, there was a sweet chocolate malt that rolled over the tongue with a hint of vanilla sweetness. It managed to be sweet without being overly sweet. There were hints of plum, blueberry, and anise as well that gave the beer a sharp bite and snap to it. I could definitely get a some of the oak spices as well as I noted a hint of cinnamon. At a 11%, I also every once and awhile got a taste of the alcohol which just gave the beer a bit more of a snap. in there aftertaste and finish, there was a hint of a light roasted coffee flavor. It was a complex beer that had a lot going on and definitely much more subtle and refined than the nose.
MF - The body was probably my favorite aspect of this beer. It managed to have a nice medium body with a light hint of stickiness that just helps it to coat the tongue. I also in the after feeling had a nice light astringent tingle that sat on the tongue as the oak spices faded away.
D - Overall this was a good RIS but definitely not one of the top beers that I've ever had. The smoke dominated nose really could have been improved and been more complex. Despite the nose, the taste was complex and full of flavor and the mouthfeel was great as well. This was a beer that the more I had of it, the more it grew on me. However, I was a little let down with this being a top 10 beer. 2,368 charactersjeonseh, May 28, 2008
4.47/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to blisscent for sharing this one. Served in a standard pint glass. Poured an opaque black with a mocha-colored head. Scents of chocolate, coffee, brewer's licorice and malt hit you in the face. Taste is consistent with nose, with the addition of vanilla and a subdued, balanced oakiness; just enough to enhance the flavors without dominating. Finish has a light hoppy character. Mouthfeel was silky without being viscous, and alcohol was well-hidden. The Abyss is by far one of the most drinkable RIS's I've had the opportunity to try. It goes down deceptively smooth and leaves you wanting for more. I plan on opening the bottle I was able to procure (thanks msubulldog25) sometime in the late Fall/early Winter and I am anxiously anticipating how this brew is going to continue to develop. 799 charactersJwale73, May 26, 2008
4.3/5  rDev -4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Appearance - dark black with orangy colored head. Mine didn't pour a huge head as some have described, in fact I found it lacking.
Smell - chocolate, coffee, licorice, bourbon
Taste - chocolate, coffee, molasses, a touch of licorice, not overpowering. I didn't care for it right out of the fridge, but as it warmed the taste and complexity both intensified. My wife agreed. I would say the smell was initially better than the taste.
Mouthfeel - good carbonation and smooth creaminess. 
Drinkability - I think this needs to age more. I can see where it would/could/should be in the US top 5, but I wasn't as flabbergasted as I thought I should be based on the high rating of this beer. I actually preferred the Stone IRS for drinkability both on taste and cost, probably the 2 most important factors in choosing something to drink regularly. However I bought a few of these and plan to try it again after it sits for a while. 928 charactersraiser, May 25, 2008
4.88/5  rDev +8.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Bless swnicholson & WeisGuy for my first two bottles of The Abyss. As a Russian Imperial fan, I was eager to try this. Managed to wait a whole couple of weeks after getting them to pop the first open. 
The Abyss slow pours like liquid black licorice out of the wax-sealed bottle. Small, dark head with an inviting smell, faint coffee & sweetness. 
Holy son of Lincoln. One sip & I'm hooked hard. The sweet creaminess, lightness despite the iron-black heart, & tiny hint of bourbon peeking through after the parade is almost passed. This packs a seriously yummy punch. Surpassingly tasty, eminently drinkable, feels like pure bliss slipping over my tongue & down my throat. 11% ABV? Whatever. I may not even notice when I fall down the stairs. Or care.
Wow. This beer not only lived up to the hype, it's way over-the-top surpassed it. This is Darkness-quality sipping stout. I'll be seeking this beer out as long as Deschutes can pump it out. Speaking of which, this is my first experience from the brewery, & I'll be seeking out more of their brews. 1,052 charactersmaximum12, May 25, 2008
5/5  rDev +11.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Huge thanks to both revkibosh and tayner for sending these my way...
This may be the most beautiful stout I've ever seen...It literally glugs out into my Duvel tulip looking very foreboding with a midnight black appearance and slowly forms a thick creamy 3 inch head that is very dark and persistent....
Heavenly aromas of rich dark luxurious chocolate, sweet plump figs, gooey inviting blackstrap molasses, strong dark coffee, smooth luscious vanilla and rich red cherries greet me as I take my first smell of this brew...I'm overwhelmed by this brew...
The taste is just as good as it smells plus some... This is just stupid... Seriously, everything pales when compared to this... In my opinion, this is what KBS and other highly touted Imperial Stouts aspire to be...its just on a different level...
Deliciously creamy and rich, dark and smooth, robust and luxurious... Does that about describe the mouthfeel?
I could drink this until I passed out with no problem... Its ridiculous...do you get the general idea that I love this brew? 2 more bottles await me and I'm going to hold on to them for a while and see how they age....
This is my second Deschutes brew and they've both kicked my ass... 1,204 charactersTilley4, May 25, 2008

The abyss. Jet black, completely opaque. Nice frothy coffee colored head. Decent retention, some nice lacing.
Some sweet molasses smell in the nose, roasted malts.
Chocolately, sweet mollasses and caramel. Roasted character. Some fruity flavors come through in there. Coffee shines in the finish. Very tasty. Alcohol is barely noticeable at all. Mouthfeel is good, just the carbonation and body you would expect.
Good drinkability here, a great beer all around. 565 charactersHojaminbag, May 20, 2008
4.78/5  rDev +6.7%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 22 oz bottle into a pint glass. 05/19/08. 2007 reserve. Cool label, and the cap is covered in black wax.
Pours thick and pitch black with tinges of maple brown around the edges. A moderate pour produces a soft three finger light chocolate-brown head. The head fades back slowly leaving some beautiful lacing around the glass. Aromas of toasted malt, milk chocolate, and lightly roasted coffee. There's also some toffee and oak in there.
Oh wow this tastes amazing! Slightly sweet milk chocolate, molasses, and caramel up front. Finishes with bitter dark chocolate, medium roast coffee, and a somewhat bitter hop taste. Very nice roasted malt character throughout. Some dark fruits come into the palate as well, notably fig and date. Underneath all that are smooth oak and bourbon flavors from the barrel aging. The bourbon flavor is very subtle but adds a nice dimension to the flavor. Overall, a VERY nice balance of flavors.
The feel on this beer is equally impressive. A nice balance of thickness and carbonation. It's smooth and creamy, but not so thick that it's chewy. The carbonation is spot on, and it's nice and dry. It leaves a thin sticky coating around my mouth. Drinkability is great for such a big beer, though it is a bit filling. It really goes down smoothly. It's not too thick and sticky, and the bourbon flavor stays in check. And the high ABV (11%) is almost nowhere to be found.
Overall, an amazing beer and excellent RIS. Definitely try it if you get the chance. I've got an extra that I'm keeping for a bit to see how it develops.
EDIT (08/25/08)
Opened another bottle after three months. Both aroma and taste have more vanilla, caramel, and oak/whiskey now, with a hint of butterscotch. A bit more cherry in the taste also. The chocolate and coffee are still there, but are subdued a bit. Still amazing and holding up very well. 1,871 charactersbkilpatr, May 20, 2008
4.53/5  rDev +1.1%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I split this bottle with Stopper. Poured at cellar temp into a snifter. The beer pours pitch black with very thick and viscous tan creamy head of 2 cm foams up easily and fades to an edge layer. Leaves windowpane lattice as it recedes. Aroma is molasses and roasted malt mixing with brown sugar and some faint grassy hops in the background. First sip reveals a fairly thick body with smooth text and mild rolling carbonation. Flavor is rich with roasted malt and brown sugar, molasses, but not a lot of oak. Beer gets a little boozy on the finish with some warmth and peppery bite. This is a nice hearty brew, not for the fainthearted. 635 characterssulldaddy, May 18, 2008

 Pours into my glass like muddy oil, deep black, with a foamy mocha head that gradually fades. Excellent lacing. One of the best looking beers I've seen.
 Nose is rich malty chocolate and alcohol. Taste is toasted firey malts, sweet earthy raw sugar, with some alcohol on the end. Lingering roasty goodness. Mouthfeel is spectacularly thick, rich and smooth. Overall a very nice brew, exceptional but not perfect. 543 charactersshivtim, May 13, 2008

this beer smells like heaven. roastedness, coffee, chocolate, molasses are all present in the nose.
this beer tastes like molassas, espresso, marchiano cherries, pitted fruits, dark roasted malt with a bourbon finish.
the mouthfeel is slick and oily. it' is appropriately carbonated and sticky.
i could drink this beer all the time although the high abv would prevent me from drinking too much. 525 charactersdeepsouth, May 08, 2008

After I spent a few minutes chipping the wax off, I poured it into a mug and was rewarded with an awesome aroma of coffee, caramel, and chocolaty overtones. The first sip was even better.
I managed to finish the entire beer within about a half hour, which was perfect. This is definitely a beer that you want to sip and enjoy, as it has dark complex flavors that really make you comprehend what you're drinking.
If you're a fan of dark beers, this one will knock your socks off, no questions asked. 555 characterskmelwing, May 05, 2008
4.5/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.52007 bottle, served in a big wine glass 59 F/ 15 C.
Completely black, thick dark tan head that stops shrinking at a quarter inch, finely textured sticky lace.
Robust smell of dark chocolate and dark roasted coffee, an impression of Oreo cookies, and milder notes of smooth molasses/ rum, purple grape, vanilla, and hints of citrus and floral hops. Cohesive and very nice.
The taste is even more powerful than the smell. Penetrating dark roast that builds in intensity, with citrus hop flavor and bitterness. Sweet caramelized sugar and toffee, well balanced by roast and hop bitterness. Like the smell, an impression of Oreos. Molasses and a bit of alcohol suggest rum. Very long finish mainly of bittersweet dark coffee.
Smooth and silky, with some slick oiliness. Quite drinkable.
Great beer, I enjoyed this. 815 charactersBeerzebub, May 01, 2008
4.45/5  rDev -0.7%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Enjoyed in a snifter, 2007 vintage.
A: aggressive pour yields 1/2 finger of dark tan/brown head that subsides quickly to a ring. Pitch black; the abyss indeed!
S: Coffee, molasses cookie, rye bread?, chocolate, citrus hops, baby back ribs?, quite complex.
T: Very mellow with bitter flavor from roasted malt lingering, but just in periphery! Flavor is so balanced and enduring. Some smoke perhaps, tiny licorice note late in the game. Not my favorite RIS, but very good.
M: Smooth and dry, perfect carbonation.
D: Only one bottle for a few of us. Same with any RIS in a 22oz. bottle though. Tasty. 597 charactersdfillius, Apr 24, 2008

Poured into a heavy glass chalice, formed a 1/8" dark brown head above the totally opaque dark brown/black brew. Head is quickly morphed in a swirly skim or small bubbles, with moderate amounts of leggy lace. Aroma is deep rich dark malts, chocolate and coffee, with vinous fruit character over lurking alcohol wisps. Taste mirrors, with the hearty malt sweetness allowing some fruitiness to peek through in the middle, and then alcohol just eases into play at the close. Mouthfeel is creamy and almost evaporates off the tongue in the back of the mouth, and drinkability is only slowed down by the glimpses of acrid coffee in the aftertaste. Looking forward to these with some age on them. 788 charactersppoitras, Apr 24, 2008

The bubbles seemed to look like a sea of golden pearls swimming around. The taste is dark, strong woody bourbon flavors with a smooth coffee taste. The finish is warming with a good presence of alcohol. 386 charactersWetpaperbag, Apr 23, 2008

The nose is immediateley espresso like with chocolate, alcohol and a hint of smokiness and burnt malts.
Immediately I picked up on bitter coffee, nuts and smokey meat flavors. Chocolate, nutmeg, roasted malts, and black liquorice also identified.
Medium bodied and surprisingly drinkable.

This is my second serving of this lovely brew in my lifetime. The first one was on tap, and so far the bottle almost lives up to the tap... but you know how it is between bottle and tap...
This is dark... like old motor oil... thick as oil as well... and well, kind of oily looking. The head is sort of short lived but a rich caramel brown. The lacing sticks well to the sides and stays around the edge.
It smells like a sweet rich fresh package of licorice... real licorice, the stuff you get from europe, not red vines. it's like inhaling sugar through the nose! oh this is divine!
This is hands down my favorite russian imperial stout, ever. it's sweet and mellow and rich and wonderful all at the same time. The alcohol is barely noticed. It's really like liquid licorice. It's almost like drinking jaegermeister without that bitter bite.
The mouthfeel is a little on the flat side and a little dusty but not much. This isn't something you can guzzle, you have to slowly sip it like a fine wine... hell, the ABV is right there!
it's VERY drinkable. I could have these fill my fridge and never tire of it. I think I could pair this with just about any meal.
Seriously, if you see this beer, buy all of them off the shelf and take them home. This beer is amazing! 1,378 charactersidResponse, Apr 16, 2008
4.35/5  rDev -2.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A - Comes out very dark brown and opaque. The edges of the glass reveal some dark ruby hues. Head was moderate showing good retention and lacing.
S - A good amount of roasted notes are first apparent on this brew. The supporting aromas are milk chocolate, espresso, and dried fruit. On the very tail end there is some alcohol mixed with a hint of metallic aromas.
T - Roasted flavors are big and out front in the flavor. That translates into a serious bite on the first sip. Once the roasted bite starts to fade, some milk chocolate and espresso flavors really start to smooth things out. Dark fruit finishes up the flavor. There is also a steady warm alcohol flavor throughout the taste.
M - Medium to full bodied with great carbonation. Finish is bitter given the huge roasted profile. Aftertaste is one of those that just keeps hanging on and never really lets go.
D - Drinkability is good. The high abv does not really show at all. This one makes a good sipping beer. Highly recommended if you can find it. 1,014 characterscsmiley, Apr 14, 2008

Poured a motor oil black into a DFH snifter. 
Light head.
Lacing and some graininess on the side of the glass.
Aroma was hoppy and some chocolate and roasty notes.
Taste : Wow! what a complex profile. I can't describe them all. Chocolate, coffee, nutty. As I continued to drink it and it continued to warm more flavors arose. This is an incredible brew!
The alcohol was very well hidden by the mouthfeel and the strong flavors. 
I can't wait to drink this after a year or so. 526 charactersJonathanL7890, Apr 12, 2008

22 oz wax sealed bottle poured into an imperial pint glass. Thick looking chocolate colored head. Good retention leaves a sticky ring of lace on the glass. Color is a pure black. Light will not penetrate this darkness.
Smell is darkly sweet. Molasses and coffee aromas mingle. Taste is predominantly charred wood sweetened with bitter chocolate.

A: Pours jet black with a rather large, thick frothy tan head. Head settled with good retention and an unbelievable amount of lacing. Fantastic looking beer.
S: Initial smell is of dark chocolate and roasted malts with a hint of molasses. Smelled just the slightest bit of alcohol, though mild and pleasant.
T: Wow is this a wonderfully complex beer. Slight initial bitterness gives way to a roasted chocolate malt taste with hints of nuts and coffee. Slight bitterness returns for a smooth aftertaste.
M: Medium mouthfeel with a slight carbonation that tickles with tongue.
D: Smooth mouthfeel and balanced taste make this an extremely drinkable stout.
2006 bottle, tasted on 8/11/09.
In short, this one has aged beautifully. Lots of dark roasted malts, bakers chocolate and espresso. The toasted character has mellowed a bit and it's probably a touch better than it was fresh. Fantastic stuff and showing no signs of going downhill. 1,054 charactersgford217, Apr 12, 2008

Smells of rich roasted malt and coffee with a hint of chocolate. Tastes of the coffee and roasted malt; I don't detect much of the barrel aging. Mouthfeel & drinkability is affected by a bit of an etoh burn. A sipper for sure but very good. I have been on a stout kick recently & I think this is a step below KBS, BS, and Peche IMO.

A: Pours jet black with a thick tan head and lots of lacing.
S: Roasted malt, molasses and a hint of sweetness.
T: Lots of layers of complex flavors. I got chocolate, molasses, anise, and roasted malt. Not as much coffee or espresso as is often found in an RIS. It is all very well balanced with a nice hop presence in the finish. Probably the smoothest and most well-balanced RIS that I have had. The alcohol is also very well hidden. I rarely found it popping through, even at 11%.

Appearance: deep thick jet black, with a big fluffy medium brown head that leaves huge lacing. Pretty much exactly what an imerial stout should and can be. Yes: perfect. 
Aroma: roasty tangy sweet and full. Very nice. 
Taste: roasty and tangy and sweet and full and then some more roasty. King of like Rasputin but without the bite. Minimal creosote, some slight smoke. Some very slight tangy fruit. 
Mouth: Tingly, fairly high carbonation for such a high gravity beer. Warm, but far from hot, again it masks the high ABV. Linger long with warm 
Overall: Delicious, very drinkable, very easy, very good. Yes, very good. Worth $10 a bomber? Well, a year or so ago, maybe not. But with prices going up like they are? It's worth every damn penny and then some. 823 characterswarmstorage, Apr 09, 2008

Aroma of vanilla, light smoke and huge black chocolate notes is pretty intense but well balance as well. Taste is a sublime mix between some black chocolate, some light smoke, molasses, some oak and bourbon. This is a very well balance mix with no flavour taking over and completely overshadowing the rest of the flavours. Body is full with engine oil consistency but with a creamy texture as well and good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. Not being a big fan of imperial stout usually I must admit that I was really impressed by the craftsmanship of this one. 704 charactersPhyl21ca, Apr 08, 2008

2007 Reserve - aged in oak barrels:
Poured into a snifter -
Pours black with a tan head that slowly settles to a thin patch and some bubbles. Very good retention for abv/style. Some lacing sticks.
The smell is of licorice, chocolate, coffee, toffee, with some dark fruitiness. A bit smoky. Complex is an understatement.
The taste is all that the aroma promised and more. Huge amount of complexities that come together exceptionally well. Chocolate, coffee, rooty, licorice, brown sugar, toffee, vanilla, oak - complex, tasty, malty sweet yet balanced with enough roastiness and a touch of subtle citric/piney/resiny hops. A well-rounded, delicious brew. 
Full-bodied, yet creamy and smooth with just enough stickiness to give it a very long finish.
Gimme more...a beer-lover's delight...and a work of art. This one certainly deserves the hype that surrounds it!
Thanks again John!
Thanks to Bitterbill for sending three more bottle of this wonderful stuff! 1,013 charactersjwc215, Apr 08, 2008
4.5/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.52006 Reserve. 22oz black wax covered bomber. Pours into my glass as black as night with an inch of dark tan foam atop the brew. Viscous and rather thick on the pour. Looks menacing in the glass. Aromas begin with big bittersweet chocolate with a solid roasty undertone. A huge blast of molasses and caramel tones as well. Licorice is lurking underneath with a touch of coffee and an oaken afterthought. Wow, simply amazing, enticing aroma with chocolate to the forefront.
First sip brings big, rich malts upfront with a bold bittersweet chocolate flavor and a huge blast of molasses again in the flavor. Deep, dark and satisfying. The Abyss is a rightful name for this one. Flows down with some vanilla, coffee and licorice. Oaky bourbon flavors are there as well however they are nicely blended and do not dominate the flavor profile by any means. Bitterness hits on the way down, balanced by a good amount of sweet throughout. This is a chewy, viscous treat.
Mouthfeel is big and unapologetic. It brings a chewy, full bodied imperial stout and makes no excuses. This one drinks like a meal and can fill you up just about as good. Overall, taking down a whole bomber is definitely possibly, but I see this being best shared with some beer loving friends. Would make a damn fine companion around a campfire on a cool night. Cheers to Deschutes and to everyone who has traded me this beauty. 1,392 charactersorbitalr0x, Apr 07, 2008
3.18/5  rDev -29%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3 | feel: 2.5 |  overall: 2.5a: This was a very thick looking black with no highlights. It poured with the darkest mocha colored head I've seen yet.
s: This was surprisingly mild overall, smelling of molasses, cocoa, licorice, alcohol, and some vanilla.
t: This started out as an amazingly complex and superb imperial stout. Every sip seemed to be different. To varying degrees at different times I tasted molasses, vanilla, chocolate, mild coffee, toasted grains, and oak. no two sips were the same and if it weren't for the finish this would absolutely live up to the hype for me. I'm not a fan of licorice so the strong licorice flavor at the end was a turn off for me. But the worst part was the mentholated rubbing alcohol at the very end. The feeling it left in it's wake reminded of how my mouth feels after an altoids. Not the flavor, just that sinus clearing "fresh" feeling.
m: The body and carbonation are both outstanding, but the mentholated dryness at the end left me cold.
d: I'm very glad I had help with this one, eleven ounces was about all I could take. If you like licorice you'll like this more than I did. Thanks to JohnGalt1 for the chance to try this one. 1,154 charactersDIM, Apr 06, 2008

A- Abyss black with a 1+ head and pretty good lacing. The brown head had an almost oily consistency with rainbow bubbles. 
S-Dark roast malts with chocolate, carmel, and licorice.
T-Complex but balanced dark malts, molasess, chocolate, and licorice. Pretty good alcohol kick too. 
M-heavy and chewy with good carbonation
D-I wasn't as impressed as some people I've talked to about this beer, but it is very good. I probably won't buy this again just because there are some really good similar beers in Colorado for similar or cheaper prices. 677 charactersNorsebrew, Apr 05, 2008

A- Poured from a 22oz bomber into a snifter glass. Pours a pitch black with no head. Some very light lacing on top.
S- Smells a bit of strong alcohol. Definite coffee and chocolate from this beer. Nice not overpowering nose. I get some fruit in the nose too plum or something.
T- Starts with some dark fruit with a quick following of coffee grinds, molasses and chocolate. This beer is a bit alcholy but not overly so.
M- Nice thicker mouthfeel with good carbonation.
D- I like this beer a lot. Nice flavors but my only complaint is the alcoholy nature of this beer. Very very tasty though. 644 charactersMudpuppet, Apr 05, 2008

4.77/5  rDev +6.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Rich roasty aroma with some dark fruit notes from the malt and a whiff of alcohol.
Poured with a 1/4 inch later of rich cocoa-colored head. Head dissipated fairly quickly. Nice lacing.
The first sip revealed a huge flavor that practically exlpoded in the mouth. Strong roast malt flavors blended beautifully with dark malt flavors of plum and raisin, bitterness, and a definite (but not averwhelming) alcohol flavor. All these flavors persisted in the long-lasting aftertaste.
Medium-bodied. Rich mouthfeel. Slightly creamy despite not being a nitro tap. Long finish with nice alcohol warmth.
This beer was something of a paradox. For such a huge beer, it was incredibly balanced and drinkable. One of the very best imperial stouts I have ever tasted. 755 charactersojclark, Mar 30, 2008
4/5  rDev -10.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4A- Thick and viscous. Thin, toffee-colored head.
S-Deep malty notes, nutty, with strong alcohol phenols.
T-Very mellow and soft for such a big beer. Chocolate, coffee, hazelnuts and burnt toast. Light notes of molasses.
M-Soft, creamy, and mouth-filling. Very well balanced.
D-Very drinkable. However, this beer is not all it claims to be. If you read the description on the bottom of the bottle, you will notice that it says "Stout brewed with Licorice and Molasses with 33% aged in oak and oak bourbon barrels." I get no oak from this beer. Although I am sure the oak contributed to the smooth character and mouthfeel, there is no character from the wood itself. I don;t get any bourbon or licorice. A bit of a dissappointment. Tastes like a Grande Reserve version of the Old Rasputin. In terms of Russian Imperials, it's alright, but certainly not worth $12 a bottle. 874 charactersDaveHS, Mar 28, 2008

A-As black as expected by the name. Very minimal Brownish head. Very viscous and thick. Laced nicely while I darnk it.
S-Dark Chocolate, vanilla, boozy fruit scent as warms, Scent is becoming more complex as it warms.
T-Strong roast/coffe at first, sweet Dark cocoa/molasses, and hop bitterness. As it warms, a mild oak flavor and bourbon are more noticeable. Some fruit but very minimal. 
M-Coats thoroughly but not as viscous as expceted mouth. A little more carbonation than expected.
D-Could drink these all night if the 11% ABV wasn't hiding in there. Alcohol is well hidden in the taste-not hot at all. And the beer improves as it warms making me want to drink more. 759 charactershopsleeroy, Mar 26, 2008
4.71/5  rDev +5.1%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 52007 vintage. Nice wax sealed bottle, I've been anticipating this for weeks. Pours jet black with two-finger mocha head. Great retention and lacing. Smell admittedly is a bit dull IMO. Smell of some chocolate, some coffee, some alcohol...typical RIS smells. Taste is great. Rich and dark. Some black licorice, dark chocolate, coffee, some oak...a true menagerie of flavor. Low carbonation and somewhat thick going down, not too thick though. Leaves a somewhat dry feeling. I was really suprised by how well the alcohol was hidden. This is a great beer and deserving of the hype. 
On a side note this beer was drank in honor of my Grandpa, who just passed away. Grandpa used to like a beer or two (or three...) and I saw it fitting to open this and drink in his honor. I dont think he would have had it any other way. The world will miss ya Mr. Ed. 848 charactersbunnyhustle, Mar 26, 2008
4.57/5  rDev +2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Many thanks to younger35 and BeerTruth and for this 2007 vintage bomber. 
Pours a deep black color, pretty much opaque, with a good inch plus of coffee colored head. Head is very creamy and retention is quite good, maintaining a nice lace and a good amount of stick.
Smell has chocolate, coffee, and roasted malt aromas, sweet but not too sweet, with some dark fruits in there and a bit of oakiness, as well. Really nice aroma; it has it all and it's in perfect balance.
Taste has all the malty goodness that the nose suggested. A low level of sweetness and the roasted malt gives it a nice balance, but is not too bitter. It's actually quite dry for a RIS. Some dark fruits again, but they're in the background. Really balanced flavor, and very tasty. There's just a touch of alcohol in there,and the slight burn mixes with a bit of an oaky flavor.
Mouthfeel is not as full bodied as I'd expect. It's a bit more than a medium body, but given the abv I think it could be a bit heftier. Still, quite soft and creamy on the palate. 
This is really an exceptional beer. Very drinkable for a beer of its size. Glad I had the opportunity to try it! 1,148 charactersnumber1bum, Mar 26, 2008

Pours black as night with a short lived nice tan head. Smells like chocolate cake, graham crackers, fresh baked chocolate cookies, and unique for an imperial stout, also with a hint of molasses. Taste is drying cocoa, roastiness, light cigar like tobacco-y flavors and char. Simply fantastic. Body is creamy but slightly drying at the same time. Perfect light to medium carbonation and the 11% is completely hidden to me. This easily lives up to the hype and is an amazing beer. Wow... 693 charactersJDV, Mar 24, 2008

Coffee caramel malt and lots of black chocolate and slight licorice/anise. When it does warm a bit, the oak aroma does come out.
Taste is expresso coffee, strong black with a malty sweet dark cherry finish. This is so good.
Aftertaste is where the hops and yeast come in. You can't taste the alcohol but there is a slight warmth at the end of the aftertaste.
Usually with heavy beers I am not quick to open up another, but with this one I wanted to keep on drinking this fine concoction all night long, or at least till I went to sleep. 650 characterspeabody, Mar 17, 2008

Opaque in color. Large everlasting chocolate colored head. It's the darkest head I've ever seen. The head has more texture than a topo map of the Appalachian Mtn range.
Smells of licorice, chocolate, and bourbon.
The richest roasted malts that I've tasted yet make up the backbone of the flavor. Mixed in is sweet licorice, dark chocolate and a bourbon like bitterness. It's what I imagine a chocolate flavored bourbon would taste like. 
Thick chewy mouthfeel.
Forget about the 11% abv, I could drink this all night long. It lives up to the hype. Please, someone send me another bottle. 616 characterswcudwight, Mar 16, 2008
4.4/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Large capped and waxed bottle, courtesy of wasatch. 2007.
Poured into a snifter, it is pitch black, with a big, foamy dark tan head, with great lacing and retention. 
Aroma is rich and complex, from dark fruits including prunes and berries to coffee, molasses, dark chocolate and an abundance of roasted grains - the roasted smell here is the predominant note. There might be a faint oakiness, but I might also be looking to hard for it.
Full on the palate, as expected, it comes out with a strong roasted flavor, grainy, with some balancing fruity notes, but the dark chocolate, unsweetened coffee and overall assertive bitterness comes along and takes over the flavor. It is at times somewhat unbalanced towards bitterness, but still very impressive. 
Alcohol is barely noticeable, if at all. 
Very good, but perhaps not as good as a top 10. Incredibly worthwhile nonetheless; need to try this one aged a little longer to see how the bitterness evolves. 956 charactersbrdc, Mar 16, 2008
4.5/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Finally got around to cracking one of these open- good thing too, its starting to get quite warm here! Let me say right off that this beer is a good deal mellower than I expected from all the hype and reviews. I like it, but not as much as Kate, Ten Fidy, Bourbon County, Rasputins, and a number of others. Its a solid RIS, but its a bit overhyped. Pours inky black, but lacks a solid head and what is there isn't as powerfully dark as a Ten Fidy. In the aroma, you can certainly smell the molasses as well as some light coffee notes, some late chocolate, some fairly mellow licorice atouch of brandied dark fruit, and the slightest bit of vinous quality. It isn't as long as a Bourbon County nor as vinous and complex and fruity as Kate, and overall a bit lighter than expected, but still quite nice. The taste is also quite smooth. Not very vinous, but instead it leans toward the chocolatey with a bit of ash, more dark fruit, molasses and quite a bit of sweet licorice. Well integrated and quite delicious, but not quite as deeply flavored as Rasputins or Ten Fidy, and not quite as complex as Kate. Still, nice interplay of flavors. The mouthfeel is a bit on the viscous side, but surprisingly light in the mouth and not at all hot. As it warms a bit of bitter licorice on the end creeps in, but surprisingly, little roastiness beyond a deep char that is almost ashy. Drinks fairly well considering it doesn't blow the top of your head off like Bourbon County and is exceedingly smooth. Exceptionally good, but not the top of the heap. 1,540 charactersGeorgiabeer, Mar 16, 2008

S - i didn't even have to raise the glass to my nose to get a strong wiff of sweet and roasty malt, on further inspection i smell coffee and chocolate as well. 
T - starts off with a the roasted malt, then i get a some sweetness and chocolate and coffee flavors in the middle before a super long and balanced roasty and bitter finished. exceptional balance. he high ABV is masked very well. 
M - a tad syrupy, but smooth and nice. 
D - i would never turn one of these down, however, after a couple of rounds could become satiating due to the thickness....i should stop and say that the high alcohol would limit me...but in all seriousness i wouldn't think about it. 858 charactersGoreStorm, Mar 14, 2008

Poured from a bottle a deep black-black with a thin mocha colored head.
Aroma of coffee, chocolate, roasted malts, and charcoal.
Tastes of rich dark coffee, chocolate, roasted malt, licorise, and molasses. Slightly bitter finish. The alcohol is surprisingly well hidden in this beauty.

Poured jet black with a caramel brown head. Head was retained thru several drinks. 
Hints of roasted malt and chocolate with a very slight taste of coffee. Almost no alcohol taste, but definitely felt it by the end of the glass. Incredible balance. 
I enjoyed the Abyss but wasn't overwhelmed by the flavor. I am more impressed with the covering of the alcohol burn, however I rarely choose a beer by its ABV. I am more curious if the taste is affected by the draft serving vs. the bottle, so I will have to crack open a bottle of mine. 682 charactersmrkrispy, Mar 12, 2008

A- Jet black, thick viscosity and a solid creamy and decent lacing head.
S- Deep dark chocolate with huge doses of burnt wood and vanilla coming through.

Pours about black as possible. Not completely opaque, some amber corners make way when held against bright light. Milk chocolate, buck hide leather head composed of tiny bubbles. Trace lacing leaves behind tiny footprints on the glass. Nose is rich, slightly peppery dark chocolates, espresso, hints of prunes and raspberry leathers. Taste is huge. Sweet and roasty, dark chocolate, hints of sweet raspberry syrup, mild dark coffee, some leathery undertones and a hint of oak and a touch of alcohol heat that warms the throat. Dropping a point on the mouthfeel is similar to looking at the Mona Lisa and saying, "I would have curved the smile up here." Really, its great, but everyone is a critic right? Just a touch to watery for me. I would prefer a little bit more creamy. Regardless, coats the mouth and lets you taste this fantastic RIS for minutes after each sip. 11% is hidden extremely well. You can argue that The Abyss is so good that you loose words to describe its greatness, or that the 11% creeps up so amazingly that you don't even feel it until you can't put together coherent words.
Awesome. 1,272 charactersRickSawyer, Mar 11, 2008

S. This is a complicated yet pleasing brew. Licorice, mollases, dark rum, expresso. The smells keep coming! This is a brew to sink your nose into.
T. As complicated as it smells. The expresso and mollases seem to dominate, but the other tastes are evident throughout.
M. Very creamy finish. The alcohol is well hidden.
D. I would like to give this a 5, but the abv and the great lengths I had to take to obtain this beer limit this rating.

4.8/5  rDev +7.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A - A black brew with a mocha colored head - mottled, thick and long lived. The lacing is dense and copious. The glass changes color to a slight brown tint due to this beer's presence.
S - Sweet dark chocolate, dates, raisins, espresso. The smell is powerful and delicious. The alcohol has a presence, but it is completely dominated, seemingly serving mostly as an aroma conduit.
T - Dark chocolate, licorice, espresso, burnt malt, grassy hops, a twinge of ethanol on the finish, but overshadowed by thick lingering charred sweetness. At warmer temperatures, the alcohol is side by side with the other flavors. The sweetness is subtle, but overall amazing. The aftertaste is mostly a charred bitter flavor. It is the least pleasant part of the beer.
M - Thick - a beer that must be chewed, smooth, pretty refreshing all things considered.
D - Wow. Words can barely express how much this beer has blown me away. Honestly, age might render this perfection. I have never reviewed a beer this highly before (out of ~600). This is fantastic. 1,040 charactersmrasskicktastic, Mar 07, 2008
4.87/5  rDev +8.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5The amount of hype this beer got here in Portland was hard to believe. Opening this beer, I was cautiously optimistic.
Not having a snifter, but not wanting to pour into a pint glass, I ended up pouring The Abyss into a wine glass. Definitely the most viscous pour I've ever seen. I wonder how much more relative quantity of ingredients this beer has per bottle than the typical beer. Color is an impenetrable black with a moderate dark cocoa-brown head. Not really any lacing on my glass, but the Abyss definitely left a coating on the the inside of the glass.
Many layers of intense aromas mingle on the nose. Dark roasted coffee, chocolate, sweet dark fruits, plus alcoholic Bourbon and vanilla extract.
Flavors are more concentrated than any other beer I've tasted. It's like they boiled off half the liquid to make a stout reduction, then bottled it. Excessive dark chocolate, coffee, burnt malts, molasses, Bourbon, licorice, earthy bitterness and more all overwhelm my taste buds. I don't recommend trying to pair this with food, you want the full effect. This is such a complex, expertly balanced, flavorful beer. Just a small sip yields a mouthful of tastes!
The finish is extremely long with a heavy, viscous, slightly alcoholic body. It coats and sticks, not wanting you to forget its presence. You know how if you let chocolate melt in your mouth, then it lingers for a long time? Kind of the same thing happening here.
Of the top-notch Imperial stouts I've tried, (Rogue, Storm King, Old Rasputin, Samuel Smith, Nøgne Ø, Yeti) this one tops them all so far. Too bad it's not more readily available. I guess it's so we can't have too much of a great thing. 1,675 charactersjosiahschlender, Mar 06, 2008
5/5  rDev +11.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured into my trusty snifter. I can't think of anything to which to compare the blackness here that hasn't been used a thousand times already (ink, midnight, motor oil), so suffice it to say this beer is really really black. The head is a devilishly dark tan that forms slowly through the viscosity, peaking at 2 fingers' height. It gradually shrivels back down to a hazy cap, leaving spotted lacing along the way.
Aroma is deceptively sweet, a siren's song that tempts you to indulge yourself. Powdery cocoa and milk chocolate tickle the nose, with faint notes of licorice.
There's a lot to be said for the chocolate/coffee flavor dynamic of the RIS world, and there are lots of beers that manage greatness confined within that dynamic. But The Abyss is so much more. The chocolate emerges early on the palate and joins forces with the bittersweet bite of molasses. The licorice is fleeting but apparent, as the beer fades into a sublime roastiness. It's never too sweet and never too roasty. You'd never know that this beer is 11% abv but for the pleasant warmth in your chest. 
The body is thick and luxurious, but this beer still finishes dry. Carbonation is spot-on for the style and facilitates the velvety smoothness.
Drinkability is immense for such a high gravity beer. The balance and synergy of the flavors make for a phenomenal brew. This beer deserves its hype and its rating. 1,394 charactersillidurit, Mar 05, 2008

This beer communicated "Russian Imperial Stout" in every way. It was dark and opaque with a very thick brown foam, and the bartender let it settle a little before topping it off. Nice. The smell was roasted malts and sweet malts, a little hint of chocolate but maybe I imagined it. The taste was really rich and sweet, with a little bit of roasty bitterness in the aftertaste. Very thick too. Really this lives up to the hype, it's good. 546 charactersTurdFurgison, Mar 05, 2008
4.3/5  rDev -4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.5Had this on-tap at Pizza Port Carlsbad while I was waiting for the Release Night party at the bottle shop. I have to say I enjoyed this a lot more on tap than I did from a bottle. It looked just as dangerous and smelled about the same. The head stuck around a bit longer than I recall the bottle doing. Taste and mouthfeel opened up to me here. It was still a little hot, but didn't have even slight over-roasted flavors. The cliched smooth, creaminess was in evidence here as well.
The only mistake I made was tasting this alone, before I had any food. On an empty stomach, finishing this pint gave me a noticeable buzz. Not sure I should knock it for that, but I had the bottle on a similarly empty stomach, without nearly the effect. 737 charactersaromatorio, Mar 04, 2008
4.01/5  rDev -10.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.52008 Bottle.
Appearance: Pours a black body with a small, fizzy, short-lived dark tan head.
Smell: Aroma of dark roasted malts with notes of licorice, molasses, and a shot of alcohol. A good measure of oak in there without overdoing it, which is always nice to see.
Taste: Flavor loaded with roasted dark maltiness. Plenty of dark chocolate syrup, toasted marshmallows, and spicy anise. Relatively mild sweetness throughout. A taste of coffee that grows exponentially as it warms. Reasonable oaky presence. A strong, earthy bitterness helps balance the heavy malt. Tiny hints of bourbon. Chewy, earthy finish.
Mouthfeel: Medium-full body. Medium carbonation.
Drinkability: Seriously, this is a fairly well-made imperial stout. Absolutely stupendous? Nah, but better than most. 781 charactersChainGangGuy, Mar 04, 2008

L:Thick one finger chocolate milk looking frothy head. The color itself is thick black, like oil.
S:Big black burtn coffee beans. A very light hint of dark chocolate. A nice hoppy aroma.
T:A combined balance of coffee and dark chocolate while sitting in your mouth. Thick milk chocolate lingers. The hops seem steel like? Those hops are very prominent though. Sweet chocolate rounds everything off.
M:THe mouth feel is thick chewey milky goodness. It gives it a fat warm feeling
D:This is a good RIS. Definitely a sipper. I would like to lay this one down for a bit to calm down the hops. Would be interesting to see what that does 664 charactersScoobydank, Mar 04, 2008

22oz. wax sealed bomber
Poured into a snifter. The Abyss pours an impenetrable black, which makes the name fit perfectly. A dark tan head sits on top, with a low rate of retention that eventually leads to the halo effect. Decent lacing. Not a very overwhelming bouquet, but I did pull out some sweet malts, bourbon, woody/oak, some liquorice and molasses. The first thing that popped in my mind on the first sip was...holy crap! Malty, rich sweet roasted malts, burnt flavors, liquorice. Nice hop balance. Bourbon hits in the end and rolls under the tongue. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy for the style. Moderate carbonation. Not sure how much of this I could drink in one session, but it is amazing. I would love to be able to buy it at will. Thanks for the trade SAS. 780 characterspaulthebeerguru, Mar 03, 2008
4.85/5  rDev +8.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 522 oz bottle poured into snifter
Decanted at approx. 48 degrees
A - Pours a seriously pitch black "abyss" with a 1/2 inch dark tan head. Lacing is well defined and hangs well after tipping. Couldn't ask for much more in appearance. 
S - Sweet malt character with strong dark chocolate and coffee flavors. Touch of an oaked alcohol scent. Molasses and caramel. Maybe some plum and other dark fruit. Becomes more tart with more molasses character as it warms. 
T - Taste starts with a dark fruit sweetness and a strong dark chocolate bitterness with espresso accents. Very similar to the scent, but that is definitely a good thing. Aftertaste expresses its hop component, with a bitter and drying sensation. 
M - Low carbonation with a very smooth, viscous, and heavy body. Nice bitterness in the aftertaste. 
D - A real pleasure to drink and beer that lives up to all the hype. Find it if you can! I see this aging well, but its a gem to drink fresh (or at least now). Alcohol is a strong component, but never cloying or over-apparent. Its 11%, so yeah, its not as drinkable as a session beer, but for a RIS its top-notch. 1,126 charactersgmcfarre, Mar 02, 2008
4.61/5  rDev +2.9%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.522oz bomber from the 2007 release. Split with fellow BA HopDerek. Thanks Derek! 
This guy lives up to his moniker right off the bat, pouring an absolutely impenetrable pitch black. Probably the darkest Stout I've ever seen and I've seen em' pretty darn dark. The finger width of head is a nice crispy burnt dark tan color that beckons you to dive in and see how far down this Abyss goes. It retains into a beautiful full, creamy layer that leaves just thick swathes of lace down the glass. It's just a handsome looking beer and one that I could gaze into for hours on end. The aroma is a little more subdued than I would have originally thought. First notes are of sweet chocolate, espresso, some dark acrid fruit sourness, and roasted malts which are then followed by some of the barrel character, vanilla and a slight oakiness. There's a lot going on but that big bouquet just isn't quite there though. 
The taste is full of big burnt bold flavors. Rich notes of chocolate, coffee, molasses sweetness, burnt dark fruits, licorice, charred roasted malt, some vanilla notes. I love the dry, lingering combo of burnt and hop bitterness and the overall way all that dark, roasted character is magnificently balanced by various notes of sweetness. The mouthfeel has a full and creamy feel that slides across the palette and down the throat. And that 11% ABV is so very, very well hidden. I think that any kind of alcohol presence just kind of retreats in the face of this guy's flavor profile. 
This is a fantastic RIS, in its own way, and I'm glad that I've got a few extra bottles of this, as I'm sure it will age beautifully. Full, rich flavors and a fairly easy drinkibility for a beer its size, guarantees that this will be one Abyss you'll want to fall into again and again. 1,780 charactersKegatron, Feb 28, 2008
4.55/5  rDev +1.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Hello new favorite beer! (Well maybe not favorite... but it's in the conversation.)
Pitch black, like an abyss! Upon pour, there's a light tan head that disappears almost immediately.
The smell is roasted chocolate and a tinge of coffee. Not at all overpowering. In fact, I'm a little disappointed by that. OK, I'm over it now because...
It tastes really damn good. Chocolate, creamy goodness at the start. Since I'm writing this as I go... I'm still waiting for the bourbon to kick in. Right now, out of the bottle, this is comparable to Darkness off the tap... just not quite there.
People say this is a sipper... fuck that, I could pound this down. In fact, I'm doing my best to baby it since I only have this one... all thanks to someone's credit card declining. Thanks dude! You surely missed out on one of the best beers out there! 841 charactersrudylaw, Feb 27, 2008
4.65/5  rDev +3.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Had this at O'Brien's on tap, served in pint glasses. Ultra dark brown with a tint of red when light penetrated this thick ass brew. Light brown head of 1/2" that settled to a ring and left a bit of lace clinging to the glass. A fine looking Imperial Stout!
The smell is sweet with rich dark fruit, molassas, licorice, some roasty notes followed by an everlasting alcoholic fume. The nose became much more apparent as the chill wore off.
The larger than life flavor is full and rich, very sweet but never cloying. Very complex with licorice, plum, molassas, some chocolate and coffee with a very pronounced alcoholic punch, and a tasty one at that. Big and bold, this is a huge stout.
Smooth, syrupy mouthfeel with just enough carbonation to keep it lively. Dangerously drinkable if you like a big RIS...top notch stuff on tap, I'd like taste the bottled version to compare some day. 886 charactersscottoale, Feb 27, 2008
4.85/5  rDev +8.3%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5No question about it, this is simply the best beer in the stout category I have ever had and even better on tap! I just had the opportunity to taste this on tap at our local beer shoppe!
Exceptionaly dark pour, rich creamy head, intricate lace residue left on inside of glass, wonderful aroma/taste with cigar smoke, dark molasses, coffee and bitter chocolate at the forefront. 
Just the most incredibly complex taste I have ever experienced. It is the best! This is my second review of the Abyss and I am very surprised that the tap brew is very different than the bottle. Very pronounced cigar smoke aroma/flavor at the forefront.
Very nice! I will enjoy the growler I purchased this coming weekend. 704 charactersDHGranstrand, Feb 27, 2008

s: toasty, bourbon, vanilla, anise, no warmth to speak of, which I found surprising
t: big malt/molasses/anise up front, followed by soft red fruit notes, nice bourbon/oaky finish with just a hint of warmth in the aftertaste. this is the week of release. had it again on tap last week, and the bourbon/oak are much more prominent, masking the fruit a bit. reminded me a bit more of the 2006, which I had on tap a few weeks ago, where the bourbon and oak are really taking over and masking some of the nuance
m: not as heavy as expected. certainly a full body, smooth/rich feeling with nice carbonation, but not overly heavy on the palate.
d: what amazed me the most is how well this beer masks the high alcohol content. the bottles I have are a bit warmer, but certainly not hot. I suppose they could use a few more months to mellow out a bit. on draft the alcohol was pretty timid... just a bit of warmth in the finish, and no notable boozy aroma. 1,046 characterspkasten, Feb 27, 2008
4.28/5  rDev -4.5%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5I got a surprise shipment from Liquid Solutions today and couldn't resist ripping into one of the bottles I preordered months ago. I was actually pleasantly surprised that I got any at all.
All right about the beer:
2007 edition.
Pours a solid black with a huge tan head that subsided a bit, but lasted through the glass. Aroma gives up some chocolate, some oak, a sweet lactose type smell, some hops in the background. Really a lot going on here. Taste hits with some chocolate, some ash, there's some alcohol and an almost vinous and bitter character in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is thick and a little gritty. Great complex stout, I can't wait to see how the other bottles develop. 684 charactersjohnnnniee, Feb 26, 2008
4.03/5  rDev -10%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Pours deep reddish brown when held up to the light in my Dogfish Head snifter. A thin outer ring of foam forms with a semi-vigorous pour. Kaki colored micro bubbles rise to the surface in the center of the glass due to the nucleation etching on the bottom of the glass. Lovely to look at. 
Nose is dark belgian chocolate with notes of vanilla and oak. Slight molasses and muscavado sugar overtones. Bourbon is definitely noticeable as well as fresh green piney hops.
Taste is not as sweet as I expected, but not in a bad way. Alcohol is upfront as are caramel, expresso and bourbon flavors. Dry, slightly acrid (from the licorice perhaps) with a mild astringent untamed hop finish.
Mouthfeel is lush and slightly viscous.
Drinkability is good but will certainly get better with aging. In two years this could really round out and be a stellar brew. As it is now, I like several other big barrel aged imperials better. 921 charactersRochefort10nh, Feb 26, 2008

2007 vintage.
A: Pours an incredible looking "driveway seal coat" black. Lovely dark brown, espresso crema colored head that leaves a ton of sticky lace sheets.
S: Surprisingly hard to get a big bouquet from this one. Subtle hints of dark chocolate, blackened malt, smoky char, dark fruit, and cherry.
T: Bold flavors of bittersweet chocolate, bitter & spicy hops, licorice, dark fruit, espresso, milk chocolate covered cherry, brown sugar/molassas, vanilla, and a touch of alcohol.
M: Sweet, slick, and oily with a sudden spicy bittering during the middle lasting all the way through the finish and beyond. Sweet, creamy, spicy, and coating.
D: Incredible! Where did the alcohol go? This drinks like a beer with half the abv of this one. Incredibly complex. Thanks to Liquid Solutions for filling my order! 899 charactersGbVDave, Feb 26, 2008
4.55/5  rDev +1.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.522oz. wax dipped bomber served in a brandy snifter. 2007 vintage. Thanks to session1979 for this one. Poured a deep black with tan head that faded quickly. A lot going on in the aroma. Vanilla, molasses, some charcoal. Massive body with a huge roasted malt flavor with coffee. There is a good amount of hop bitterness evident in the start. Incredibly long finish of roasted barley. Alcohol was not evident, very drinkable for the ABV. I didn't get much wood flavor, just the vanilla in aroma.
This one lives up to the hype. 524 charactershomebrewhawk, Feb 26, 2008
4.63/5  rDev +3.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.522oz bomber of the 2007 vintage (I never saw any 2006 bottles in my neck of the woods, but reviews indicate it did, indeed exist) purchased at Jim's Homebrew for $10.25. Is it me, or is the wax covered cap really annoying to get off? Yeah, Yeah it looks all fancy-like, but the point of beer is enjoyment, not "look, we're as fancy as wine" histrionics. Also seems like a lame attempt to capture the mystique of Dark Lord. Not only is it lame, it's also unneccessary - as any perusal of the forum will tell you, this beer has developed it's own mystique.
Poured this into a Duvel snifter. Was a super dark, almost black shade of brown, and looked damn viscous as it left the bottle. Initially no head, but within about five seconds a good 1 1/2 inches of dark mocha colored foam exploded upwards from the motor oil-like liquid and took about three minutes to drop back down. Not a bad display of head retention for an 11% beer. Sheets of tan lace recede down the sides of the glass, leaving a spotty lace behind.
Initially, the most dominant scent was a black licorice scent that reminded me of when I cook with fennel seeds. Soon, a dark brown sugary maltiness was also detectable, along with a woodsy booziness. This smells like it's potent, which is no surprise. 
Smoky like a good, robust cigar, roasty like a dark roast coffee, with a sharp, citrusy hoppiness cutting through the dark, roasty murk. There are also dark chocolate and cocoa notes, along with a bourbon-like boozy flavor which I can only assume comes from the bourbon casks used for a portion of the aging. The finish is both molasses-y sweet and bone-dry. This is the most complex tasting stout I've had in a long while. 
Viscous, oily mouthfeel, and very full-bodied, just as I'd expect for a beer like this. 
It's been a contentious subject, but I, for one, believe it lives up to it's hype in terms of flavor. I'd love to have access to Dark Lord, and have for some time, but now I also would like to do a head to head comparison between it and the Abyss. Drinkability is outstanding as a nightcap, which, at the end of my workweek, I'm using it as. If Deschutes would brew this in a larger quantity, I'd be very happy, indeed. 2,205 characterswoemad, Feb 25, 2008
4.01/5  rDev -10.5%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 422oz. brown bomber, purchased from Liquid Solutions, poured into a snifter.
A: Pours solid black with good viscosity. 1 finger of head forms with a bit of a cascading effect. The head is deep mocha and has good retention. Very good lacing throughout.
S: Strong, bitter coffee notes are mostly dominant. A nice alcohol presence glides throughout but doesn't get in the way. Maybe a bit of chicory in the coffee? A nice sweetness throughout that has a buttery depth to it.
T/M: Wow, the hops are so bitter! Maybe just a bit too much when tagged along with the bitter coffee and bitter German chocolate notes. The chocolate is a bit on the powdery cocoa side. Alcohol is quite present and adds more than a warming to say the least. Burnt malts keep everything dry but a bit chalky. Body is full and carbonation seems controlled. Where's the barrel?
D: This is definitely a sipper and the 1 bomber will be more than enough. I'd love to try this with down the road to see if it mellows. 985 characterspwoods, Feb 25, 2008

A: After using a knife to remove the wax (damned the wax coated offerings!), the stout opened with a hiss. A pour revealed a three plus finger head, thick and bubbly with a tan color. The stout is dark, nothing but blackness in the glass.
S: The nose is bitterly acrid, burnt and over the top with touches of bread pudding sweetness. There is little in the way of balance.
T: The stout kicks you in the teeth with its hoppiness. Not quite a DIPA but lots of citrus bite to cut through the roasted elements. As the hops fade, a nice round of bitter, burnt, scorched even, taste. Lots of flavor emerges (but where was it in the nose?), keeping the palate reasonably happy. A vinous alcohol bite lingers throughout the beer, warming as it goes down. 
M: The beer is harsh and biting, lots going on but I think that the beer needs several years to mellow out.
D: At 11%, this beer doesn't pull any punches. I am not sold on Abyss in a fresh state; I think that several years in my cellar will really calm this beast down. 1,102 charactersakorsak, Feb 24, 2008
4.46/5  rDev -0.4%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Generously shared by Jay23, review from notes. 
Purely opaque, obsidian black, glimmering in the light. Slow cascading tan foam, it's surface has a creamy texture. Puffy concentric rings of sticky lace hang on the walls of the glass. 
Ashy tobacco, woody oak in the nose. Not much sweetness, it could use a little chocolate to balance. It would get a 4.25 if possible. 
Big smoke presence, dry roasty malts, chocolate, licorice, and dry tobacco leaves hanging aloft in a Kentucky barn. Earthy char with very well integrated notes of oak. Not picking up huge amounts of bourbon, reflecting the partially bourbon-aged blending. This is most welcome, and lends itself well to an impossibly silky mouthfeel, without harsh spirits crowding in. 
Feel is creamy and robust, without getting syrupy. Nice dry finish. 11% was completely hidden, this was a fantastic Imperial Stout, glad I had the chance to try it. 908 charactersemerge077, Feb 23, 2008

Pours a super opaque black, some red in the edges, huge thick light brown head forms, leaves behind some nice lace spots, good retention, forms a solid layer. Smell is very nice, bourbon, toffee, light smoke, chocolate, big roast, charred wood and oak, burnt raisins, alcohol, big in all ways. Taste is similar, lots of charred wood, bourbon, vanilla, chocolate roast, coffee, smoke, caramelized fruit, licorice, molasses and piney bitterness in the finish, super balanced. Mouthfeel is full bodied, viscous, low carbonation, warmth, pretty damn drinkable for such a big stout. Reminded me a little of Darkness. Lives up to the hype! 755 charactersViggo, Feb 22, 2008
4.8/5  rDev +7.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.522 ounce bottle covered in black wax purchased from Holiday Wine Cellar for eleven dollars, 2007 vintage, drank tonight during Lost and while playing some video games, took me over two hours to get through the whole bottle, poured into my Dogfish Head snifter
A-One of the darkest beers I have ever seen, not a glimmer of light through the glass, gives new defintion to black, 1 1/4 inch mocha colored head, nice retention for about five minutes, sticky lacing for the first hour or so
S-Bourbon notes, chocolate, both milk and dark, faint coffee until it warmed and got more intense, lots of oak, several different sweet aromas I could not figure out, big vanilla presence as well, hoppiness, roasted malt, burned sugar
T-Started off with a lot hoppiness for this style of beer and a big roasted malt flavor with some chocolate, charcoal is definitely in the finish, could not taste the bourbon until later it was nice and spicy when it came to the surface, also some black licorice tastes later on, very nicely balanced with lots of burned malt and sugar to go along with a favorable level of bitterness, beer had it all, went from being dry, sweet, chewy, boozy, hot, and ended with a subtle coffee flavor, very enjoyable taste for the entire drinking experience
M-Dry and crisp at the beginning, sweet and spicy once it warmed, bourbon really burned the tongue towards the end, thickest body imaginable other than Dark Lord, great level of carbonation that did not have too much, taste lingered for up to five minutes at a time
D-Could drink a couple bombers but would need to spread it out over several hours, alcohol is hidden great until it is past room temperature, stuff is heavy otherwise would have been perfect, smooth and goes down extremely easy for a stout of this caliber
Never tracked down a bottle last year and barely gome some this time around, thank goodness I stopped there after the Stone Winter Storm, one of the best Russian imperial stouts I have ever tasted, right up there with Kate the Great, Darkness, and almost as good as Dark Lord in my opinion, just another reason to love Deschutes, I bet the 2006 version is drinking wonderfully right now, will definitely be drinking again soon, probably buying a case next year, cannot recommend this one enough 2,288 charactersFloydster, Feb 22, 2008
4.52/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Very excited about trying this one which, of all places, I found at the local grocery alongside the so-so selection of local brews. Better yet, Deschutes is my go-to favourite for great local NorthWest beers that don't break the bank.
Presentation is a great half-fourty bottle with a wax-dipped top hiding a standard cap. Pops with some vigour to present: the blackest beer I've ever seen. Has some thin head that is also quite dark, like extra dark chocolate milk. No telling if this is clear or cloudy, the light just stops when it hits the glass.
Smell is pleasingly oaky - no messing around with subtleties here. Past a nice clean and slightly smoky wood is lots of sweet dutch cocoa and even some hops! You'd think that under all that dark malt and wood esther that the hops would be muddy, but they're downright floral.
Body is far lighter than the hue and nose would suggest. Like chocolate whipped cream, almost. The hopping becomes salty and less spicy, the bourbon opens up without being boozey at all. Malt profile is dark, nearly burnt, but there's something in there balancing it out so it's not ashey. A bit of caramel hides in the corners. If there is any anise in this as the label claims, there's only the faintest hints of it right after the swallow before the hops open up.
The real marvel of this beer is the feel of it on the tongue. At this strength and this colour and this malt profile, you flat out expect it to be like motor oil - but it isn't. The carbonation matches the weight perfectly so that it's like merengue on the palate. Odder still is that it only coats the lips and throat with a fine layer that fades quickly. No cloy, no sticky, no lasting bitterness.
I don't know what to say; I'm totally bowled over by this beer. Whether you're a fan of Deschutes or not, if you like hop-forward NorthWest micros, this is one to get. And if you find it for the same trivial price that I did, for the love of god, grab a half dozen. 1,964 charactersojiikun, Feb 22, 2008

Roasty aroma, with a bit of smoke in the background. Hints of chocolate, and a burnt sugar character.
Very roasty flavor. Again, some smoke and oaky character comes out. A bit of dark, bittersweet chocolate. Not a lot of sweetness. Oak character is subtle.

4.26/5  rDev -4.9%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4I have let this one age for one year since the trade with bennetj17. 
Crawls out of the bottle with monsterous black legs like ink from a fountain pen. Head is rocky fat milk chocolate colored bubbles standing at three inches. Slowly fading head seems to last forever leaving some lace. Nose has roasted chocolate beans, smokey malt and zesty alchol notes that penatrate the senses. With first sip you get a rush of creamy chocolate icing like tones. The taste buds are flooded with sweet syrupy tones of esspresso, chocolate sauce, caco and toffee like malts. Twords the end of the palate you get a unique mixed balance of sweet zesty dark fruit skins and coffee bitterness which is rather dry. Drinkability of this one is very nice but the slight bitter bite on the back of the tongue is the only real low point of this beer for me. A great stout though, truely. 865 charactersSPLITGRIN, Feb 21, 2008
4.62/5  rDev +3.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Poured from a 22oz. bottle into a Great Divide Yeti glass. Beer was black with a small, dark tan head. Heavy lacing around the edge of the glass. 
Aroma was heavy malt, chocolate, molasses and strong coffee.
Taste was heavy coffee, chocolate, and light oak. Also had a faint licorice presence. Very tasty, warming beer. Still a bit hot and could probably mellow out with some aging, but an incredible beer. 
Mouthfeel was thick and chewy. Finish was long and fairly bitter. Let this one warm up to truly enjoy all the flavors hiding in it. 542 charactersdrumrboy22, Feb 21, 2008
3.66/5  rDev -18.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Thanks to largadeer for the sample.
Pours a 1 1/2 finger head with an excellent retention. It is near black in color.
Smell is of mint and strong chocolate malt with hints of mint and lirocirce. The smell is a little weak though.
This beer is overly boozy. It balances out as the beer warms a little, but it is still a problem for me. It's hard to make flavors distinguishable. I taste licorice and undertones of mint with some chocolate malts and a little roasted characteristic to balance. Caramel sweetness comes out as the beer warms too. Raisin undertones come out as well as the beer warms.
Creamy/thick mouthfeel is nice, but the astringency of the alcohol detracts from the mouthfeel somewhat.
Decent beer. The astrigency of the alcohol detracts slightly from the drinkability but is more of a bothersome on mouthfeel and taste. 841 charactersjasonjlewis, Feb 20, 2008
4.8/5  rDev +7.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured semi-aggressively into a wine glass. This results were a oil black sludge with a beautiful dark brown head! LOVE IT! The smell is what you would expect. A sweet, syrup, smell with hints of bourbon. This beer is complex. The taste is bold with a creamy mouth. I can taste the alcohol which I think actually compliments this beer. I think its best to age this brew for a last 6 months to a year. I think at that time it will be phenomenal! The drinkability is a little low for me because this brew isn't for the weak. It will put hair on our beer geek chests. 
Overall, this beer is magnificent! I think with a little age this beauty will be an exceptional brew! 668 charactersiconoklaztor, Feb 19, 2008

Pours a dark brown with a moderate thick brown head. Smell is sweet. Excellent flavor, very subtle and complex. I can taste the cask aging. And is that licorice I taste? Yes, according to the bottle. The hops are also quite impressive, definitely apparent but certainly not overpowering.
This is a very unique stout. I've never tasted some of these flavors in a beer before.
Highly recommended. One of the best stouts I've ever had. 484 charactersbassmantin, Feb 19, 2008
4.75/5  rDev +6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Pours a very very dark brown, no light coming through from the other side. Smells of coffee, malt, a bit of chocolate, but not a very strong smell. Tastes like a rich version of Obsidian, which was really what I was hoping for, as Obsidian is my favorite American Stout. Coffee, chocolate, burnt nuts and malt. A very nice balance of flavors. Overall, not as thick and intense as some other imperial stouts, but this isn't really a bad thing because it's a great combination of flavors. I don't really care for a sludge-like beer. Extremely drinkable for this style. A first rate beer. 585 charactersPhxHorn, Feb 19, 2008
4.95/5  rDev +10.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 52007 vintage, 22oz bomber served at cellar temperature and poured into a pint glass
A - Poured a hugely thick and evil looking jet black molasses looking sludge into my pint glass, hitting the bottom of the glass like a thud. Such a rich dark color, there was no chance at all of any light coming through this one at any point what so ever. A huge dark tan colored head rose up from the depths of this one reaching a height of easily three inches which never really did settle down to much, leaving a constant pillow of brown of top that at the most settled down to around an inch and a half. Very nice cascading of the foam when this was poured, almost like a nitro-tap pour, very full. The side glass lace was tremendous, leaving behind thick stringy webs of brown that coated the entire glass, and to be honest were still coating the glass the next morning when I woke up. This was one serious monster to be reckoned with, and I can see where its name came from, it looked like anything that fell into here was never coming back.
S - The aroma was spectacular, engaging, and simply full beyond expectations. The first thing I noticed was how sweet it was, tons of sugar here in the aroma, thick molasses like smells that really sweetened it up. Mixed in were the slightest hints of French roasted coffee and dark chocolate, really giving this that big dark aroma that you look for in the style. It never really did lighten up any, as even an hour into the bottle it was still evolving. No hint of any alcohol in here at all, which was insane to think about. It really had the aroma that was pegged as a dessert, so rich and full, and soo sweet. The only thing I could say was as it warmed it started to let off some more coffee notes along with a noticeable hint of vanilla that again confirmed how sweet it was.
T - I really do not even know where to start with this one. I had waited a long time to try it, and have read all the hype and was really hoping this would be as good as I wanted it to be, I have to be honest, it was better! I really have not had many things that were as good as this one was, I am not even half way through my review and I know the score here is going to be a perfect one, but enough of that. The first flavors I was picking up were rich caramel and molasses sugars that were layered upon a coffee like base. This gave it such a rich, complex and sugary profile that I was not even sure what was going on. As it warmed subtle notes of chocolate and licorice started to come though and blended in very well, keeping it sweet, but at the same time confirming its dark nature. Hints of vanilla were then layered on top of that, so complex, but at the same time, so simple and elegant. This was like the mother of RIS's for me. Towards the finish you could pick of trace flavors of oak in it that was evidence of its aging. The finish had a surprising amount of dry bitterness to it, that really caught me off guard being how sweet this was for the entire session, but this was nice really drawing it out and letting it bring you back in again for another round. In a word amazing.
M - This had to be the thickest, smoothest and creamiest beer I have ever had. I crave a good stout that has the consistency and feel of a chocolate shake, this almost one upped that, really setting a bar so high that I do not know if I can ever find something that can top it. The carbonation was superb, really putting a show and giving it that silky feel. There was no, none, not even a though of this being anything but a superb offering. Insane really how good this was.
D - I was waiting for this category to make mention of the fact of how good this was as a night time sipper. Now the bottle says 11%ABV, bit heck it could have been 5%. There was just no hint of it anywhere in here. Which is amazing if you thick about it. I sipped on this one for a good hour, and by the end it was probably close to room temperature and was just as good a when it came out of the cellar. This was just amazing. I really would love to be able to have this one on tap, in my house, once a night it is just that good.
Overall the style is easily one of my favorites, and bounces back and forth with an IPA for the top really, and this was the best I have ever had. It was just perfect. The aroma was perfect, the taste, feel, appearance, everything I just could not think of anything that could improve here as it was the epitome of the style and I am so glad I waited so long to try this one as my palate has really evolved and allowed me to appreciate this one more fully. Could not think of a better selection for my 800th review. This was perfect and anyone who can get this and does not try it is a fool. 4,718 charactersmikesgroove, Feb 18, 2008
4.65/5  rDev +3.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5A- Black as night; no light is passing through here. Head is a darker brown color and fairly thick and fluffy. Lacing is awesome with thick sheets down the sides of my snifter.
S- Oaky, chocolate, coffee, cocoa, a little bit creamy, sourwood, molasses, and licorice.
T- Cocoa and chocolate with the bourbon sneaking in and alcohol tastes midstream. The oaky taste hits the tongue on the end and finishes bitter-sweet. Licorice is subtle while cooler, but comes out more as it warms. Roasty malts are present on the back. Just a tad burnt to me.
M- Thick and somewhat chewy and low to mid on carbonation.
D- As a stand alone beer to split with a friend, just right. 
Overall- I have heard the hype, and it lives up to it nicely. Rich, full, and very, very complex. I was not let down one bit. 
Thanks to JohnGalt1 for throwing this one in as an AWESOME extra in our past trade. 882 charactersMMAJYK, Feb 18, 2008
4.57/5  rDev +2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4I had this beer at Stone on tap, and it was simply fantastic. The tour guide in the brewery recommended it, and I thought that was odd, since it wasn't a Stone beer. However, I must say it was well worth it. For those who think that beer can't be more complex than wine, this is one to try.
It has a very dark color with a nice tight brown head. It smells roasty, chocolate, and a little like raisins. It has a multitude of flavors that make it more like a desert than a beer. I wouldn't recommend having more than one, but I could sip on and enjoy one of these near the end of any meal. It is full bodied, and not cloying or too dry--it is balanced just right. Excellent beer overall. 685 characterszymurgy4all, Feb 18, 2008
4.18/5  rDev -6.7%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 42007 edition, 22oz bottle. Grabbed this a month ago and decided to drink it the other night with some friends. I really enjoyed it but I wish I had bought 2 bottles as this beer really needs to sit a few years. 
It looked awsome when poured into the pint glass. It was incredibly dark with no light coming through. The head was dark brown heading on black and was very thick and sticky. Great retention and lacing. I let it sit for about 10 minutes to warm up as it was too cold and the head didn't budge. This beer truly begs the question "It's like, how much more black could this be? and the answer is none. None more black"
The smell was strong of fresh oak. I beleive the oak used was fresh and hence my comment on this could stand to age for a few years. It had that strong peat smell that you would get in a young scotch. Also there was tons of wonderful black raosted malts and some dark sweet chocolate coming out of the glass at me. Even the foam smelled of RIS. The aroma of this beer was wonderfully strong and inviting, just young. No alcohol on the nose.
The taste was almost as good as the smell but the strong oak presence wasn't quite balanced as well as it could be by the malt. My estimate is 3 more years in the closet and this beer would get all 5's in a review. The rich roasted flavors and the nice sweet chocolate blended together well. There was some alcohol in the taste which did get more pronounced as the temperature rose but the oak also came out with the heat. So despite 11% abv it was still tolerable.
Very thick and viscous and wonderfully drinkable. It will catch up with you though so be sure to enjoy it with someone or make it your only drink of the night. Remember, that even though the bottle is $10 or $11, buy a couple to age.
2008 edition purchased at Hollingshead's a week ago. 22oz bottle.
A - 4.5 S - 4.0 T - 3.0 M - 3.5 D - 3.0
It was nice to try this beer again after a year and even though I've had this years vintage on 2 occasions prior to tonight, I hadn't actually given it enough attention to take good notes on. I'll say this: this beer is a huge let down after last years.
Pours the same as the other vintages, pitch black, nice dark brown foam, good retention, good lacing. Both lacing and retention could have been better but nothing to complain about. Looks very nice indeed.
This years vintage is much heavier on the roasted malt and thats evident in the aroma. Coffee and chocolate with a harshness that I remember from the 2007 that comes from the oak and booze. A little harshness (basically synonymous with freshness) is alright in a big stout in my opinion. No real complaints here either except the overdone coffee qualities. 
Flavor is interesting. Maybe my palate has changed considerably but I remember the 2007's flavors blending a bit better. The coffee flavor dominates but is completely seperate from the chocolate, the oak (fresh oak), and the booze. I guess thats what aging is for. Also, very dry and bitter, too harsh to enjoy thoroughly.
Being dry is usually a good indicator that the body is going to be thin and this is no exception. Not thin in an absolute sense but thinner and less viscous than the 2007. Low/med carbonation, just right. Over all the beer is nice, but again a let down. 3,279 characterst0rin0, Feb 18, 2008

Smell is like a freshly brewed cup of coffee. Some chocolate aroma as well. Probably the most inviting aroma of any Imperial Stout I've ever had.
Tastes pretty much like it smells, with lots of coffee and chocolate. It also tastes fairly smoky, which is not very appealing to me. Bitter finish rounds out the taste well.
Mouthfeel is full bodied and creamy. This is like drinking a coffee and chocolate shake. Flat out delicious, and perfect except for my dislike for the smoke flavor. 674 characterssrroos, Feb 17, 2008

S: Smells of coffee, nuts licorice, caramel and molasses. Very nice smell.
T: Wow, where to start....Very dark and smoky tasting. The wild ride this beer takes you through is crazy. Full of nutty, coffee, licorice a hint of caramel and I get just a wee bit of a flash of fruit taste. It leaves with a nice chocolate coffee taste. 
One thing I failed to mention, and this is a testament to the beer, it buries the alcohol in an avalanche of flavor.
MF: Full bodied beer that feels just right, thick like a stout should be.
D:The only two things that keep this from being one of the most drinkable beers I've ever had is the cost (roughly 10$ a pop) and the high ABV...other than that this beer has it all. 896 charactersChillMike, Feb 17, 2008
4.75/5  rDev +6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Thanks to RoyMunson for the bottle.
"2006 Reserve" (So, in other words, 2007 release).
Poured into an Oversized Wine Glass.
Appearance: Pours with a one finger burlap sack/coffee-colored head. Really wonderful. Lasts for the good portion of 2 minutes. Lacing is very prevalent, with fine calligraphic patterns as well as spots and arms. Body is the blackest of black, truly an "Abyss."
Smell: Wow. Slight alcohol on the front end, but underneath are some wonderful aromas: coffee, espresso, tira misu, coffee licquer - in other words, a lot of coffee, but in deep, flowing complex waves. Not one-note at all. I mean, one expects to find coffee aroma in a stout, much less an RIS, but this really does a fantastic job in that regard. Chocolate truffle. Some dark fruits, general cream, slight licorice, and wood linger underneath, but I'm going have to stop smelling now because I can feel the olfactory fatigue coming on. I didn't really detect much in the way of bourbon. Wonderful, though.
Taste: Wow. All the flavors in the nose. The bourbon comes out a little bit here, rounding its head around the other flavors, but doesn't smack you in the face, say, a Bourbon County Stout by Goose Island does. The oak imparts some vanilla and overall smoothness to what is otherwise a huge, huge, huge, huge stout.
Mouthfeel: A bit spicy and hot, but not overly so.
Drinkability: Surprisingly drinkable. Exceptionally smooth at the same time that it is unendingly complex. Overall, one of the best RIS's I've had. 1,513 charactersRidiculedDisplay, Feb 17, 2008

M - Full bodied (duh!). Coats the mouth well. Not much in the way of carbo, but I wasn't expecting much.
D - Pretty good sipper for a huge beer. 
Overall, this is a great beer. Huge and complex without being too much. The barrel flavors are not dominant but instead pop up to add spice. Definately a great RIS. 651 charactersMonsone, Feb 15, 2008

S - I can smell it from here and the glass is 2 feet from me. This will only get better as it shakes off the cold. There's some chocolately notes for sure. the smell is very rich.
T - Chocolate taste with some roasted coffee. Bitter after taste. Nothing is too sweet or syrupy. Mostly chocolate taste.
M - Leaves a little dryness after the sip. Medium or heavier body. Smooth feel and not too carbonated. Can feel the booze in the taste afterward, but The Abyss is 11% so there's no surprise. It's not an offensive boozy taste, but a lil warming.
D - Don't think I could drink this too fast or have too much. Really good tho. really good beer. I'll really enjoy this beer.

3.98/5  rDev -11.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.52007 vintage consumed fresh. Pours a two finger dark brown head, like hot cocoa color. Liquid is pitch black and poured thick. Not as thick as Ten FIDY (made by Oskar Blues, a local brewery), but still quite thick. Smells cigarette ashy, roast, chocolate, potent hop grassiness. Caramelled peaches. Light-colored fruits and clean alcohol sting.
Tastes potent roast with a rising sweet followed by a rising chocolate. Lightly sweetened baker's chocolate is dominant on the flat of the tongue before the swallow. Ends dry with coffee aftertaste. Milky sweet character balances the dark grains and hop grassiness. Pretty yummy. Alcohol sting is present, but buried under the sticky sweet. It hangs around in the aftertaste on the edges as a bit of an edge. Aged in oak barrels?...maybe some raw oak tannin, but not bourbon or vanilla. Near the end of the glass, the alcohol is quite wearing.
Moderate carbonation and thick body with a slick viscosity. Decently drinkable now, but is sure to improve with time in the cellar. 1,022 charactersmentor, Feb 15, 2008

First apprearence is jet black with very little head. What little head there was is brown and creamy looking. 
Aroma, wow..dark roasted coffee, caramel and oak..I have to say this on one of the best smelling Imp. Stouts..Really amazing.
Flavor..Dark bitter espresso, with a hint of caramel and very subtle oak. Very nice. I was afraid this beer would be over oaked but that is not the case. Very well balanced. 
After my initial notes I finished this snifter with a piece of Deschutes Chocolate, Stout cheesecake and I have to say this beer was even better. The richness of the cheesecake was not only complimented but cut slightly by the roasted character of this beer. Truley an amazing combination. 
I do think that I have finally found the best Imp Stout that I have had the pleasure of tasting. I really enjoyed this beer. 890 charactersFishdawg71, Feb 13, 2008
4.58/5  rDev +2.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Mondo thanks to Cloudskipper for the 07 bottle. Pours a deep dark brown with ruby hues eking in on the sides of my snifter. A nice dark khaki head. This smells initially of vanilla, heavy on the oak, and coffee. A bit of cocoa in there. 
Nice sweet and malty upfront with some honey sweetness lingering on the tip of the tongue. Coffee and oak come through in perfect harmony, keeping each other from dominating the brew. This doesn't taste like what was in the barrel, it tastes more like the barrel itself. I love licorice and am hunting for the flavor but can't really identify it, possibly toward the bitter, vanilla end. The hops are put to fantastic use here, nice and citrus/grapefruity, the kind I associate with West Coast IPAs, appealing under and to the sides of the tongue the n bittering the finish along with the coffee/oak combo. Both sweetining and bittering the beer. For me, this is what distinguishes this RIS from others. 
Upon warming, the licorice is a bit more apparent upfront and the smell is decidedly boozier. 
Mouthfeel is lush and silky and while the abv is knocking me out, its going pretty unnoticed in the flavor. 
Overall, just awesome. Glad I didn't wait to try it as there's such a lovely hop profile in the back. I'd be curious to see how it ages but feel like it might suffer from the hop-loss. Leaves off a little bitter for my liking and the oak becomes a bit more dominant as it warms, but not overwhelmingly so. In the end, a great RIS with characteristics unto itself. 1,514 charactersgrandq, Feb 13, 2008

Pours dark and rich screaming it's name into the bowles of the glass. Black is it's color and it makes no excuses for it. Looking into this beer is akin to looking into veiled nigrescent houri eyes. A salacious tanned head, rests atop, one finger thick, begging for that first forbidden tender bite.
A: Like I said, akin to the gaze of a veiled nigrescent houri. A thick creamy tan head leans towards mocah tones refusing to die. Lacing is tight and persistent. Very sticky, won't quit.
S: With cupped hands over the glass and a deep breath molasses strikes first followed by dark roasted malts and rich coffee wafings
T: Sapid. Licorice is bold with the first sip but if you let it wander coffee, molasses and oak come through. Roasted chocolate too.

Delicious! Rich and deep with the illusion that it has been aging in the barrel for a year or more. Molasses, licorice, chocolate, coffee...
Mouthfeel is great, velvet and almost creamy. Your mounth will immediatly salivate after the first sip. The alcohol kick is there, and as it warms up, you really get the flavors even more pronounced.

Pours pitch black and lightless with 1 inch of bubbly tan head that fades fast leaving good lacing and an oily residue. Smells are very salty, like soy sauce and leather. Coffee grounds, chocolate, anise, and some oak come out as it warms up, along with a slight bourbon nose, but not as prominent as I was expecting. Tastes are of room temperature hot chocolate, with faint licorice, molasses, and oak mixing in from time to time, with a good coffee backbone and a bitter hop finish. Full bodied, smooth, and creamy with a good dry finish. Hides its alcohol content very well. A very unique brew, even amongst the other Russian Imperial Stouts. Though it's oak aged, the aging doesn't cover up the other flavors. I'm sure this will age nicely and could be even better down the road. 796 charactersHopDerek, Feb 10, 2008

Smell: Charcoal, grapefruit, espresso, dark chocolate, licorice and molasses; a touch of oak, but less than I expected
Taste: Right from the start, the grapefruit citrus jumps out and tangoes with the traditional espresso and dark chocolate flavors that would be more expected in a RIS; once they settle in, the sweet and fruity, black currant flavors burst forward; after the swallow, there is a burst of alcohol, followed by a strong roasty element but the finish is pure grapefruit hops
Mouthfeel: Full bodied, almost viscous, with moderate carbonation; considerable warmth after the swallow
Drinkability: This is a great beer, with plenty of complexity and an unusual take on the style; it will be interesting to re-visit in a year, when the hops settle down (which I did, by the way, but the hops still made their presence felt while allowing the coffee and chocolate flavors to shine in their complexity) 1,050 charactersbrentk56, Feb 09, 2008

2007 Bottling
I was lucky enough to get this in a recent trade, big thanks goes out to you Bill. Abyss gurgles from the bottle and appears as a black mass in my snifter. The tan head grew to one finger as I poured and left some quality drink lines after each sip. The head eventually falls to a skimming with a thick ring surrounding the body. A good looking stout for sure.
The aroma doesn't have as much of the noticeable barrel aging as I expected. As this beer warms the aroma gets better and better. I left this one sitting out of the fridge for probably 40 minutes before opening and still the aroma just keeps getting better. Each time I bury my nose in the glass I find myself inhaling healthy doses of roasted grains, freshly ground coffee, and molasses in order from most aggressive to least. Hints of anise, oak, and spicy alcohol make ghost like appearances here and there along with a solid pine hop presence toward the back.
Flavor follows in stride with the aroma. If you want to read about the flavor profile take a look at the paragraph above. Everything is smooth and balanced for such big flavors. I'm not sure of the IBUs but they're in a good place considering they're not only balancing out the malts but also making a show of themselves. There's a solid roasty bitterness on the swallow to create a good finish.
Body is full without a doubt. Starts off moderately full and as it works its way through becomes creamy and coating. Sluggish carbonation keeps this one working at it's own pace and lets each flavor work on the taste buds.
This beer sips along smoothly for an 11% monster but after I kill off this bomber it's going to be bedtime. 
This is a beer to sip throughout the night. Another excellent Imperial Stout. The barrel aging was done very nicely for this beer. The barrel compliments instead of takes over like what happens with so many other barrel aged beers. 1,917 charactersjoe1510, Feb 09, 2008

The beer poured a deep coal black with a nice dark brown head.
The aroma of the beer was full of dark roasted malts, dark chocolate, and ash. Some young oak and tobacco in the aroma as well. Not too much bourbon to speak of.
The flavor of the beer was focussed on roasty malts to the point of being slightly ashen. Mid-palate could've used a little more molasses/dark fruit sweetness. The hops seemed slightly citrusy and pretty up front. The finish had a faint tobacco note as well. The oak note was somewhat green, like young white oak. Not so much the vanilla-laden caramel that comes from a nice toasted barrel. I didn't get a whole lot of bourbon either.
The mouthfeel was full, but was not too heavy. It finished pretty dry for a RIS. The carbonation seemed dialed in well. 
This beer is good, but overhyped IMO. There are much better imperial stouts out there that eclipse Abyss in both complexity and drinkability. KtG, DL, and BCS are few that come out ahead IMO. 1,027 charactersSacoDeToro, Feb 07, 2008

This poured with a pitch black appearance though ruby at the edges, and a rough dark brown head that almost blended in with the body of the beer. If there was anything that could remind me Older Viscosity (one of the most amazing beers I've had recently), then this was it. Right from the first whiff you could tell this was one rich beer, chocolate, roasted barley, and coffee like flavors abound. The flavor was dark chocolate soaked in bourbon, though the bourbon doesn't give off too much of its own flavor, more just like a warmth to the overall taste. The mouthfeel was perfectly slick for this type of beer. Thick but not too viscous, it was able to go down pretty easily. A very rich but easy drinking high gravity beer. 820 charactersMiScusi, Feb 07, 2008

S: The aroma isn't quite strong enough for me, but whats there is good. Strong coffee aroma with a touch of roasted malt.
T: Very strong powerful flavor. Nice rich coffee hits initially and it fades into nice milk chocolate. Throughout the entire taste and through the aftertaste there is a nice bitterness that lingers; but it seems like it is more from roasted malt than hops. It ends with a nice sweetness as well.
M: Nice thick body with good smoothness.
D: Definitely a good beer although it does leave a pronounced bitterness. I'll see how it does with some aging. 688 charactersdrseamus, Feb 07, 2008
4.66/5  rDev +4%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Talk about dumb luck, I managed to find both this and Pliny the Younger on tap at Toronado while in San Francisco. I also found a few bottles of this but the review is from Toronado, served in a tulip.
A: Dense pitch black. Deep mocha, coffee colored head that dissipates to a thin film and lines the glass. Basically perfect looking for a RIS, only complaint might be wishing for a slightly thicker head, but I'm going to ignore that as part of the pour.
S: Ok, sometimes in bars I have trouble picking up a good nose on a beer and I'm afraid this is one of those cases. A little sweetness from licorice and some raisin but primarily roasted flavors (chocolate, coffee, etc). Definite bourbon/alcohol pinch.
T: Yea, I'm usually skeptical of beers with this much hype and well, this delivered. I like RISs but am sometimes turned off by the bitterness of them. This was much less bitter than say Old Rasputin. Incredibly smoothed and well balanced, tons of roast malt, chocolate, coffee, oak flavors all in balance. Finish is slightly more sweet and roasted than the body and I would expect some people to look for more a hop/bitter taste, but I'm perfectly happy with the taste. It's very complex and enjoyable and had to go back for a second pour. Obviously at 11% abv there is a slight taste of alcohol hiding in the background, but nothing unpleasant or overpowering.
M: So thick, creamy, smooth, rich....Light carbonation, just, perfect....
D: For such a powerful, complex beer this is very easy to drink, nothing is too out of control but I just notch this down from a 5 since while I loved this, I certainly still need to be in the mood to drink this. I also definitely preferred the draft version over the bottle. Flavors just seemed more balanced and smooth and would probably let the bottles sit a little before drinking them again. 1,843 charactersyourefragile, Feb 06, 2008

The smell is very roasty, with some chocolate notes. A hint of bourbon in the nose, as well as some coffee.
The taste is very nice - sweetness from the malt at the start with the roasted notes and vanilla and bourbon undertones. A very smooth drinking beer, with a nice amount of bitterness in the finish. The alcohol begins to show slightly as this one warms up.
The mouthfeel is thick and sticky. Nice creaminess and medium carbonation.
Really enjoyed this one, it's young but already really good. I would put it up against the best stouts available and I think it would be right there with them. Excellent beer. 683 characterscartdan, Feb 05, 2008

4.63/5  rDev +3.3%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5I am cracking open a '07 Abyss. Poured at 50F into a wine glass.
Near black color with a thick espresso head. Settles to a silky cover and leaves a nice lace. 
Nose has a complex roasted malt structure with licorice, molasses, chocolate, toffee oaky wood, bourbon and coffee. Also a good amount of floral hops and some dried figs or cherries.
The first sip delivers a very dark and earthy malt flavor. Adding to this first wave of musky sweets are dark ripe fruits, chocolate and rich dulce de leche. The flavor profile is kept in balance by a floral hop presence and roasty oak. Contributing to the bitter finish is licorice, molasses, faint bourbon and espreso. 
Thick and creamy texture kept in perfect control by delicate carbonation.
One of the most complex and complete stouts made. Very mature for its age, but will improve for many years to come. Simply delicious. 877 charactersrye726, Feb 04, 2008

a: Very dark brown that turns ruby when held to the light. Big thick light brown head settles slowly leaving a web of lacing in its wake. 
s: Sweet malt, licorice, chocolate, coffee.
t: Big, bold rich malts possess notes of dark chocolate, dark roast coffee, and dark fruits. The licorice, molasses, and whiskey barrel aging are all present. Did I mention how rich it is? 
m: Thick, creamy, velvety texture. Full body. Typical carbonation.
d: Damn, that's a good beer. Alcohol is completely masked by the absurd malt profile, like drinking a milkshake made from dark chocolate. Of the overly hyped stouts on BA, I think Dark Lord has a bit more complexity, though the Abyss is a bit easier drinking. Which one is better? I believe such a distinction is trivial when you're talking about beer that's this good beer.
If you are lucky enough to find this beer, get as much as you can, its a must try. 1,086 charactersBradLikesBrew, Feb 04, 2008

Pitch black in color with a thin brown head. Aroma of thick smoke, roasted malts, bitter chocolate, molasses, coffee.
This is a punch in the mouth. I'm thankful I've got some strong chili to eat alongside it. Oily and slick on the tongue, with taste bud-deadening potency. Dark and roasted, with a big alcoholic kick and a dark espresso bean roasted quality, with nice, bitter hops. Dry in the finish.
For how big this is, it's surprisingly drinkable. This would keep you warm on the coldest winter day. 558 charactersRockyTopHeel, Feb 04, 2008

Appearance is absolutely amazing, pours the brownest hue, head is three fingers of creamy, sparkling frothy head that cascades upward and amazingly sustains over tiime, big milky lacing on the glass
Smell is also excellent, sweet milk chocolate dominate, some roasted malts, slight anise, molasses, gingerbread, bourbon alcohol, and a surprising presence of fresh earthy/grassy hops
Taste is superb, sweet milk chocolate rides a wave of underlying ginger/bread malts, bourbon and alcohol warming enters midway as do bittering hops, cocoa sweetness rebounds and finishes with alcohol warming on the soft palate through the back of the throat
Mouthfeel is full-bodied, smooth and creamy texture, lively carbonation that is a touch prickly
Drinkability is high, this is my new favorite IRS, I'm a big fan of the sweeter chocolate malts compared to the uber-bitter coffee malts, great all around appearance/aroma/flavors, I think the balancing hops are impressive as well considering they don't detract from the dominant malt profile, I sure am glad I was able to secure a case of this, I am sure this will age well in the coming years! 1,222 charactersStoneman78, Feb 04, 2008

Well, I've talked up this beer quite a bit on the boards. That was all based on a tiny couple of sips at GABF. It was by far the best among great beers that I tasted there.
Pours a deep, deep black. Some might say abyssal black. Good brown head that eventually fades to some lingering swirls. Beautiful.
Wow smells galore. Just follow the description on the website. Roasted malts are prominent. Grainy. Licorice, bourbon, chocolate, and an ever so slight touch of alcohol.
Big roast on the palate. Slight twang from this. Dark chocolate and big bitterness. Maple syrup. Slightly dry finish (pinot noir barrels?) No alcohol to speak of - amazing.
Yum, this is creamy and thick and definitely tasty, but the drinkability and taste scores suffer right now. This is a great beer, but right now it's only great. Give it 6 months to a year in good cellaring temperatures and it will become phenomenal. Just refer to BuckeyeNation's review below. That's what I remember tasting at GABF. Buy one and taste it. Buy several more and put them away. 1,056 charactersbiking4beer, Feb 02, 2008
4.76/5  rDev +6.2%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5"If you gaze long enough into an abyss, the abyss will gaze back into you."
--Friedrich Nietzsche
2006 Reserve. Obliterative black that threatens to suck all ambient light from the room. Okay, that's probably over the top, but the beer is aggressively dark. The molasses hued cap is one of the darkest I've seen and is a treat for the eyes. It's thick and rich and long lasting and does a great job blanketing the glass with sheets of finely bubbled lace. In a word: perfection.
The nose is very good without being an absolute stunner. It may be that my expectations were too high, but I expected something with more pungency and more complexity. I can appreciate chocolate fudge and blackstrap molasses. Where's the black licorice? Where's the bourbon? The label says 'aged in oak barrels', but it doesn't say whether or not those barrels previously held bourbon.
The Abyss is *definitely* deserving of the hype. What amazes me most is how it's such a gentle giant. It tastes as if this bottle has been aging for several years rather than barely one. The various flavors all get along beautifully together, as if they've had all the time in the world to get acquainted. 
The alcohol delivers just enough warmth to let you know you're drinking a massive beer that needs to be respected. Completely declawing and defanging a beast like this one is never a good idea. In case you're wondering, the 2006 is drinking splendidly right now.
A huge amount of roasted malt (and assorted other ingredients) delivers flavors of dark chocolate, espresso, caramelized sugar, molasses, licorice and sugared vanilla bean. The depth and complexity is close to overwhelming at times. If you love RISs and have the opportunity to buy a case of The Abyss, do so. You won't regret it.
Sweetness edges right up to the 'too sweet' line, without putting a toe over. The key is a surprising amount of citric, sprucey, resionous hops. On second thought, given the region of the country in which these guys brew, I'm not a bit surprised. There's no doubt in my mind that the flavor deserves the ultimate score.
The mouthfeel is a veritable feast for the senses. Like almost every other attribute of this fantastically delicious ale, it finds that precise sweet spot between too much and too little. It's heavily silky and glassy smooth and... well, it's simply perfect. 
I have gazed into The Abyss. I've also smelled it, tasted it and felt its creamy lusciousness. This is a Russian Imperial stout for the ages and is one of the finest beers that I've ever had the pleasure to imbibe. Believe the hype and buy all you can get your hands on. Bravissimo! 2,637 charactersBuckeyeNation, Feb 02, 2008

Very tight dense mocha colored head forms, about 3 fingers high. As I drink this beer is see the very slightest legs trying to form. Severing temp. about 50F.
Smells very mild for such a rich brew. Got hints of roast barley, vanilla, and charred oak.
Tastes pretty good. Doesn't have the complexity that I expected. I get a very bold, roasty flavor, burnt chocolate, stale coffee and some charcoal. I get the very slightest vanillin taste but no oak.
Mouthfeel is great, very creamy. I found it to be slightly slick, a substance that is hard to remove from your tongue. Carbonation is low and quite appropriate for the style.
All and all, I can tell you I won't be buying another $9.49 bottle of this beer. I think that the marketing team had some wonders for this beer. They have gotten into a lot of head but they haven't fooled my mouth. I don't think this is a bad beer by any means but I think there are far better examples of this style. I might go out and a whim and buy one more bottle for the cellar and I'll break it out in five years and she how she has matured. I must add, I did not sample last years batch, I have to assume that it was far better than the 2007. That's the only way I can justify it's following. 1,346 charactersBadRockBeer, Feb 02, 2008

Lite brown head never dropped .... I waited about 15 minutes before I took the first sip... Totally pitch black.. no light escapes.
Aroma is all roastiness on sooo many different levels.. espresso ... dark chocolate .. not as much oak as I remember from last year but it's still prevalent.. Brenda smells licorice.. me not so much... throw in a lite handful of fresh raisins for good measure.
Satiny viscous body.. creamy.. thick rich imperial stout flavors... dark caramel and bakers chocolate .. just enough sweetness to really tie everything all together... dark malts and more vanilla than last year ... and less bourbon than the '06.. a little char... sip this one slowly and savor it... very little alcohol but it is a little warming in the belly and the brain... simply fantastic... 
Pick it up and enjoy while you can and definatly cellar some ... Some Boise BA's and I did a massive imperial stout tasting in early December and my favorite and at least a few others were the '06 Abyss... close second was the '06 Bourbon County.. but I really do love this beer. 
The only thing I can really "complain" about is it needs a little more time in the bottle to meld completely. 1,306 charactersJohnGalt1, Feb 02, 2008

That's ok I went everday for a week and picked up two each time. Bwahaha take that! Poured a midnight black color. Even dark around the edges of the glass. A froathy tan head when poured that remained throughout the tasting. Surprising their wasn't as much viscous to the glass as I was expecting with such a big ABV.
The nose is rich with complex malt with chocolate, roast and a bourbon woody essence mostly. A superb balance overall. Touches of coffee, vanilla and molasses comes out as well. This is surprising as this beer is relatively fresh just getting it new from the store.
The taste is fantastic. A great mix of malty flavors with chocolate, roasted barley and some alcoholic warmth. Not over bearing with the astringent flavor but instead a smooth almost lactic quality from the licorice. The woody flavor is more subtle than the nose indicated. There also is a red wine-like flavor that comes out as it warms. Interesting enough there is a very subtle hop flavor that comes out with the bitterness and a floral finish. Nice to try this so young as if aged you probably wouldn't get this flavor at all.
The body is big, no kidding at 11%. But the surprise here for me was the smoothness of the beer and how everything just blended so well. Even the alcohol is noticeable but is blended so well. Overall this is a top 10 beer everyone should try once in their life. Guess I will keep going to the store till they run out. 1,504 charactersOxymoron, Feb 01, 2008

I enjoyed smelling this beer. There is so much going on. For me the bourbon, chocolate and vanilla stood out the most. The oak and coffee played second.
Tasting it, the flavors blended well. I get little bursts of caramel after the bitter bite. I didn't get black licorice taste. But I started smelling it. I'll drink some more and seek out that flavor. I love this beer. I expected more roughness and frankly I expected to find it over hyped. This one is well done.

A: Blackest beer I have ever seen and super thick. Nice 2 finger dark tan head. I think on the density scale, this is just a bit less than a black hole...
S: Bourbon, coffee and chocolate really stuck out to me, but plenty of roasted malt as well.
T: The flavor is just massive. Coffee and vanilla dominate, with chocolate, bourbon and oak coming out. Quite good.
MF: Extremely smooth, heavy and thick. Big warming, the alcohol is quite noticable.
D: This is really an awesome stout. I wouldn't say it blows other beers of this style away, but it's right up there with anything else I've had. My only regret was this was my last beer after a long day of sampling at Lost Abbey and Stone, and I just couldn't finish the whole thing. Obviously with the big ABV, just one is enough to last all night. I wish I could find this again, but I guess I'll just have to wait for next year. 944 charactersrxdrewthejew, Jan 31, 2008
4.54/5  rDev +1.3%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5First taste of this was a bottle served in a snifter. We hadn't chilled the beer much, plus it hadn't aged at all yet so it was slightly flat, and a little green. However, this is still one of the best beers I have had. 
Appearance is like that of motor oil. Seriously. The head was small, almost non-existant. Bubbles were very fine and chocolate colored.
Smell was very complex, notes of bourbon, red wine, vanilla, and roasted barley were all present, allthough much more I couldn't name. Very full, very complex. You could bottle it and use it as an aphrodisiac. Seriously.
Taste was just as complex as the smell. The pinot noir became more evident, as did the bourbon. Couldn't taste the vanilla, but chocolate and roasted barley came out much more, especially as it warmed up in the glass. Alcohol taste was not present, but I could feel the alcohol warm on the back of my tongue and throat.
Mouthfeel was a little thin only due to the low carbonation level.
Drinkability- good. Unnaturally good, for such a big beer. Aging it as long as they did gave a lot to the smooth quality of this magnicifient masterpiece, allthough further cellaring undoubtably would add to that.
Overall, a great beer from a great brewery from the great state of Oregon:) 1,260 charactersbeermebeerman, Jan 30, 2008

Poured jet black with a very large brown head that stuck around for awhile. A gentle swirl would pillow the head back up at least a half inch as the beer warmed.
Aromas were exactly what I expected. Chocolate, molasses, oak, vanilla, roasted barley, very subtle licorice.
Taste was extremely complex. While 33% of this is barrel aged and then blended back in those are really the background flavors. None of that hot bourbon character some barrel aged stouts take on. Chocolate and roasted grains with some vanilla from the oak. Definitely some espresso flavors present.
Mouthfeel is a creamy delight. Very full bodied and with the perfect amount of carbonation, this just slides down easily and you hardly notice its high ABV.
I give it a high drinkability when being compared the other beers in it's category. I could probably get through a 22oz bottle by myself easily, but no more than that.
Some may call this overrated just because of all the hype it receives before it's released but I would say it's worthy and stands tall among the other RIS examples. I'll look forward to this seasonal every year. 1,245 characterskleffman, Jan 28, 2008
3.31/5  rDev -26.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3 | feel: 4 |  overall: 322 oz bottle. Pours a dark blackish brown with a frothy dark brown head that retains well and laces the glass.
The aroma is more subdued than expected - roasted chocolate malts, strong oak with a little anise, nitrogen(?) and leather.
The flavor is strong overpowering black licorice at first with a little oak and sweet chocolate malts leading to a charred bitter finish. The alcohol is well hidden. The mouthfeel is medium to full with low carbonation. 
Overall, I tend not to like the black licorice flavors, and this one has it strong. As it warms (or as I get used to it), the sweetness starts to balance it out. 620 charactersBeaver13, Jan 28, 2008
3.76/5  rDev -16.1%look: 4 | smell: 3 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3 |  overall: 3.5Purchased from City Beer Store in San Francisco.
A -- The beer pours a pitch black. Very nice lacing, but minimal head. It looks fairly standard for the style. 
S -- I'm not getting much aroma aside from what I take to be chocolate malt. I get a slight undertone of vanilla and caramel, but complexity just isn't there.
T -- I hate to say "Beer X tastes very much like beer y," but to me, this tastes very much like North Coast Old Rasputin. This certainly isn't a bad thing, as I think that beer is fantastic, but it doesn't strike me as being unique. That said, I love the taste so I'd be a fool to knock the taste. Again, vanilla and caramel, but far from complex.
M -- The beer is thin bodied, a bit of a far cry from the trend in American imperial stout brewers. I would compare the body to Alaskan Smoked Porter. I'm not really sure I enjoy a stout this thin.
D -- Very drinkable, but again, expectations come to play. If you make a very limited release, you set high standards. I would certainly say that the beer is overhyped. I don't think this is a bad thing, as it has certainly opened me up to other offerings from Deschutes. If you find this at your local beer store, you owe it to yourself to try it. Otherwise, I'd go with Obsidian Stout, which in my opinion is a better offering from the brewery. 1,317 characterssessycuban, Jan 28, 2008

A: Pours a very dark motor oil thick brown, with a full tan head which leaves lots of lacing, quite opaque.
S: Not as big as I would have hoped for in this style of beer, but still complex and interesting, lots of burnt sugar and molasses, with charcoal.
T: Roasted malt goodness hits you at first, with a light hint of burnt sugar and charcoal. The beer continues to evolve, as the sweet bourbon comes in to add complexity, not as overt as a beer like Firestone 11 or Curieux, much more subtle. Wood notes, tree bark and sweet vanilla end the beer's flavour profile, with a biting licorice aspect and espresso coffee in the aftertaste.
M: Smooth, very big, but extremely delicate and soft allowing the flavours to expand and allow the drinker to truly appreciate them and makes the beer much more drinkable, still it is quite thick and warming, gives you the best of both worlds.
D: An outstanding beer from Deschutes, an excellent sipper. Not totally blown away at the first taste, the scent wasn't really there, though I think the beer was just too cold. But at room temperature or close to it, the beer really opens up and has a great flavour profile I think is worthy of the hype. Definitely one of the better RIS's in America, though I'd like to see what a few years does to this brew. 1,381 charactersHalcyondays, Jan 26, 2008

Appearance - Pitch-black. 2 inches of chocolate-colored head forms upon pouring, with incredibly good head retention for such a high gravity beer.
Smell - The aroma is almost chocolate chip cookie dough-like; it has notes of chocolate and vanilla with a backbone of sweet, biscuity malt. Oak is noticeable but fairly subdued, while the addition of licorice provides subtle spiciness.
Taste - Sweet doughy malt, molasses, burnt toast, sharp oak, bittersweet chocolate and bourbon - very dessert-like in flavor. Licorice lends a spicy, refreshing kick to an otherwise sweet profile. A deep roasted bitterness appears in the finish, long and coating, providing a drying contrast to the initial sweetness. Remarkable complexity and yet so drinkable.
Mouthfeel - Full and creamy. More amply carbonated than most Imperial Stouts. 841 characterslargadeer, Jan 26, 2008

The 2007 Reserve is a blend of 33% of oak and oak bourbon barrels. Served at around cellar temp.
The color really is like looking into an Abyss, dark molasses, and heavily roasted coffee been colored syrup in a glass. A thick two inch head of foam trickles down slowly to the Abyss. Theres some lacing and very good retention.
Aroma is quite complex, but I pick up right away some coffee, molasses, oak wood, musty barrels, and roasted malts. There is also a heavy presence of woodsy licorice, earthy hop notes, dark fruits like figs, dried prunes, and raisins. Then a third layer reveals some cocoa, milk chocolate, hints of chocolate covered cherries, and vanilla beans. Some vinous aromas and green grapes as well.
Wow, the taste is just like the aroma and then some. Chocolate cereal, chocolate malts, oak, cocoa, dark fruits and a bit of alcohol. The finish has a dry chocolate, and roasted barley bitterness feel.
Mouthfeel is really creamy with a little fizzy carbonation to keep it from being too thick. This definitely is a heavy beer, and a meal in itself.
The Abyss is a good beer, a very good sipping beer, but I think it can get even better with age and that is one thing I am looking forward to. The flavors seem a little rough and grainy but Im sure these will settle within a couple months. 1,515 charactersseaoflament, Jan 25, 2008

Poured oil black with a 3 finger brown head into a snifter. the head was very slow to disappear. about half way through the glass it was still 1/4 inch and laced the whole time. it was a black beauty. 
Smells divine. Roasted malt, coffee, licorice, and sugary sweet smell which i am assuming is the molasses. 
Taste is fantastic. This is one beer that, for me, lives up to all of the hype. it is very complex but after drinking half the bottle i was starting to be able to pick out individual flavors, roasted malt, ash, coffee, licorice, with a sugary finish. There is just a small hit of oak and vanilla as the beer warms. In my opinion alot of big beers have TOO much of the oak which dominates, this one just compliments and seems to be a perfect balance. The back end has a little bit of dark chocolate/coffee bitterness that cuts the sweetness. There is some bourbon alcohol warming after swallowing, but i would never have blind guessed it was 11%. VERY well hidden. 
Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth. one of the easiest RIS's ive ever had. 
I didnt give a perfect drinkability score as it is a BIG beer, so one or two is plenty in a sitting although if this were available all the time i could see having one for desert a couple times a week. 
I am so glad i "made the cut" on LS and will get a bunch more of these for my cellar... id like to say i will hang on to them for 3-5 years, but i am not sure that is possible! 1,478 characterstayner, Jan 25, 2008
4.23/5  rDev -5.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4My first tasting of the legendary The Abyss. And, to be honest, I'm a bit let down. To be fair to the beer, I think it's a victim of its own hype and rarity. My expectations were undoubtedly too high. Yes, it's a damn fine Imperial Stout. Yes, it's a great example of what an Imperial Stout should be, from the color, to the aroma, to the taste. 
But is it really in a class by itself, definitively better than other style leaders like Old Rasputin, Mikkeller Black Hole, or Big Bear Black Stout? No, it's not. Oh, sure, one could debate which one was slightly better than the other, but they're all basically in the same league. And, at least here in the Bay Area, Old Rasputin and Big Bear Black Stout are far easier to find, as well.
So while I'll happily admit that The Abyss is a fine Imperial Stout that can be compared to the best in category, the mania is overblown. If you run across some, definitely try it. And if you don't, and have another leading Imperial Stout that is easily obtainable, that's okay, too. 1,022 characterswatchnerd, Jan 24, 2008

4.88/5  rDev +8.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I bought this locally at Poplar Wine & Spirits. At the case price, they're only US$10 apiece & tax so I got 2 cases.
It's the 2007 Reserve and comes in a wax dipped 22oz bomber. I wonder how difficult it's going to be to get it open?
Twas easy so....it pours a very near pitch black with a nice 1" head of tannish, creamy looking foam. The foam shrinks some but there's still a solid layer near the end of my session and...darn good lacing to be had here as well!
Taking a few whiffs, I notice notes of bourbon, dark chocolate(which is infusing a nice bitter aroma)and some coffee. 
The first sip...the complexity literally explodes in my mouth and it's no where's near the temp that I like to drink my brews. Wow. I can definitely taste the bourbon and oak influence but the chocolate is just as powerful and there are tastes of toffee and molasses and when I swish the brew in my mouth, I notice the liqorice is there as well. My, what a tasty son of a gun! The abv is there, yeah, but for me, it's just some warming *after* the swallow. The mouthfeel is quite thick and chewy and the carbonation is fairly robust for the style but it works. The finish is pretty dry with that hot chocolate bitterness and the aftertaste lingers on for some time afterwards. Superb! And dangerously drinkable; I blame it on the smoothness if that can be looked upon as a negative comment. lol.
This is an *amazing* brew and I'm so happy that Mike at PW&S snatched up the 7 cases allotted for Casper. Why did he do that? Because that's the way he rolls. ;^)
Edit: 2009 Edition, best after Nov 1, 2010, cost of $12.85
Again, a near pitch black pour with over a finger head of tan foam. Lacing certainly is up to snuff.
The smell is loaded with roasted malt, coffee, chocolate, both dark and milk..not much in the smell of any bourbon, unlike the 07 and 08 I had that were sampled equally fresh. Ok, it warmed up some and I now *can* smell the effects of what BBAging can do.
I say that until I actually taste it. Yep. The bourbon barrel aging is the first thing I notice. Second is a light flavour of licorice that I didn't get in the smell either. Both of those give some way to delicious roastiness, coffee, milk and dark chocolate the latter of which adds some good bitterness....as usual. Ha. This is a very consistent product put out by Deschutes and that pleases me to no end. I earnestly think what ever hype is generated by The Abyss is genuinely earned.
Full bodied as it's older kin, with medium carbonation, it has yet again a great mouthfeel. Smooth as silk with the 11%abv kept in check.
Drinkability? What can I say? This has the sort of drinkability that most brewers would love to see their consumer friends boast about. Especially for a brew that is quite the heavyweight when it comes to the abv. Deschutes and me? We are like that...picture me and some Deschutes rep giving each other the high 5. :^)
Ok, back to the serious "stuff". I can't change my previous rating at all. The smell was the minorest weakest link in the 07 and that holds true for the 09 as well. 
A tip of my virtual hat goes off to Mike at Poplar Wine & Spirits again for thinking of me and the other 2? peeps(that I know of) who appreciate the finer things in life when it comes to beer
Edit: Subsequent samples of the 2009 revealed a distinct sourness that has no place in The Abyss; commendably acknowledged by Deschutes. Sipping on my first 2010 and my faith is restored! Not that I ever lost it. Deschutes is first class all the way. Anywho, the 2010 is divine and backs up fully why I rated this beer as high as I did, and I do. A magnificent brew that deserves to be in the top 10 of anyone's list of top Stouts and top brews in general. 3,731 charactersBitterbill, Jan 23, 2008
4.73/5  rDev +5.6%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from 22oz bottle into a Duvel snifter. Poured inky used motor oil black with a thick 2 finger tan head. Smell is an abundance of sweet chocolate, smoke, coffee, and an alcohol with a nice hop aroma cutting through. Taste is very heavy espresso flavor with rich dark fudge and molten chocolate cake sprinkled with coco powder, a hint of anise and alcohol finished with a slight vanilla oakiness. Mouthfeel is full body thick with a chalky grit texture. The carbonation is smooth and more carbonated than a lot of of IRS but not over carbonated. While full flavored and high in alcohol you would think that it would be low on drinkablity. However it really is tasty and best for a dessert sipper, and could be drunk with a slowness best for enjoying but one will suprised when its gone that they still want more.

4.75/5  rDev +6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5I poured a waxed and capped 22 ounce bottle into a chalice.
A: I poured an absolutley black body with a richly dark chocolate sticky head composed of varied sized bubbles. The head receded leaving an even cover and supporting a dense and even curtain.
S: It had rich aromas of varied chocolates (milk and dark), dark and ripe fruits, roasted malts, creamy molasses and a woody smokiness. 
T: It had a richly complex mix of well balanced flavors that were a real taste treat. The sweet dark roasted malts give off a creamy blend of chocolate flavors that are then well complemented by the bite of hops that remind me of drinking bitter sweet coco flavored campfire coffee. Interlacing the chocolate and coffee flavors are ripe dark fruits, toasted brown sugar, and an espresso like hop bite. 
M: It is a thick, smooth and creamy full-bodied brew with a sweet front and pleasantly bitter back. There is a warm clean finish and a slight and pleasant coco and bitter aftertaste.
D: This beer finally revealed to me the promise of a finely crafted stout. I have the same joy drinking this brew that I have drinking a chocolate latte on a hot afternoon or a rich dark roasted espresso on a cold winter morning. It would be hard to drink more than two in a setting but I would dearly love to try...again and again. 1,312 charactersdnichols, Jan 22, 2008

This pours out inky, black as night. Slow gurgles of carbonation. A poolish consistency to the bubbles, zebra stripes of lace on the glass.
Nose is molten milk chocolate, blackstrap molasses, vanilla. Undertones of caramel, maple syrup, heavy cream. Imposing.
Taste is ridiculously smooth and harmonized for such an imposing beer. A sweet, thick, under attenuated fudge bomb blobs up your gullet with all aforementioned aromas caressing your tongue simulataneously. Other than a few booze vapors on the nostrils, this is unbelievably free of alcoholic heat.
Seems nearly formless because of the beautiful craftsmanship. Powerful, amazing. Even at fridge temperature this thing seems warm and uber viscous. 
I had planned on grabbing a few bottles of this to age for a long while, but why? This seems nearly perfect the way it is. Enjoy now until 2010.*

4.8/5  rDev +7.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Picked up a case of this delicious nectar yesterday at the Coop for a bargain $8.49 a bottle. This brew is one of my favorites and Im lucky to have access to it. Drank from my Black Butte Porter pint glass. 2007 Reserve.
Appearance- Pours a super dark murky brown that leaves a fantastic one finger dark tan head. Head slowly recedes to leave a nice cap and collar but not a whole lot of lacing.
Smell- Big and roasted with loads of bittersweet chocolate and hints of vanilla bean. Coffee and bourbon mix to produce a wonderful scent of extra strength Baileys Irish Cream. Cherry, licorice and a tiny bit of sweet molasses finish off the nose.
Taste- Deep roasted malts start like the nose with loads of bittersweet bakers chocolate with a soft vanilla contradiction. The licorice is plenty noticeable but I dont get much molasses, maybe a little in the sweetness of the aftertaste. A double shot of espresso shows in the middle along with a nice kick of cherry. Finishes with the lingering flavor of bourbon soaked wood and vanilla.
Mouthfeel- Thick and rich with a smooth cashmere feel and light carbonation. A bit of warming is present as well from the alcohol.
Drinkability- This is a big beer (11% ABV) but it drinks a bit smaller. The alcohol is well covered and this thing is loaded with flavor. The vanilla and oak in it are some of my favorite flavor characteristics that beers can have and none are better at it than The ABYSS. Highly recommended! 1,466 charactersyounger35, Jan 19, 2008
5/5  rDev +11.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 52007 Reserve
The first thing I do when I pop the cap is put my nose down there and give it a deep whiff. Wow. Smells like chocolate cake infused with coffee and bourbon. 
As I pour, I notice that the head gathers steam very quickly, and is easily the darkest shade of brown that I've ever seen sit atop a beer. Its viscosity is evident as you watch the bubbles form and settle. This beer is beautiful. All Imperial stouts are black, but this one just has that little extra something to it. 
The aroma is remarkably similar to the Obsidian Stout. If I had to give somebody a quick, generalized description of the overall aroma, I'd say that it's a cross between Oak Aged Yeti and Obsidian Stout. There's just so much going on here. It's got the coffee presence of the best coffee stouts, tons of bakers chocolate, oak, bourbon, and that's all I'm able to identify at first.
The taste is just plain decadent. Pleasingly bitter, a touch of sweetness, and that oak/bourbon presence to make you really feel as though it's a special occasion. The alcohol itself is nearly imperceptible behind this abundance of competing flavors. As it warms, the coffee and chocolate take about a half step back and allow the oak and bourbon to really shine. With that, a hint of vanilla exposes itself in the aroma and then in the taste. The molasses really comes through in the lingering aftertaste. 
The mouthfeel is milky. Not a lot of carbonation. This is a dessert beer for special occasions. Truly decadent and complex. I'm not sure I've ever come across a beer that held a more fitting moniker than The Abyss. The only thing I can imagine improving this beer is age. As a youngster, I really think it's perfect. My favorite Imperial stout to date. 1,738 charactersjakon, Jan 18, 2008

Appearance: Midnight black with a dense, brown head. The head lingers for a long time and the liquid coats the glass well. 
Smell: Complex, roast malt aroma with hints of molasses, hops, toffee, caramel and vanilla. Slight alcohol undertone. 
Taste: Subdued sweetness with a touch of bitterness to provide balance. I can taste a slight bourbon presence and limited oak character, but neither overpowers the brew. The finishing alcohol flavor provides a nice bite and warmth. 
Mouthfeel: Full body. Velvety smooth with a slightly oily quality. The flavor truly lingers. 
Drinkablity: Very powerful brew. Well crafted and worthy of the respect it gets. 660 charactersSargeC, Jan 18, 2008

A: Pours a thick pitch black with a moderate tan head that settles to a halo of large bubbles. 
S: Mocha coffee, chocolate, and hazelnut aromas. Very nice smelling, but the nose isn't quite as big or complex as some RIS's. 
T: A big and complex flavor with coffee, chocolate, anise, and a bit of alcohol. The earthy flavor from the oak lends a slightly astringent taste to the beer. 
M: Thick and full-bodied with light carbonation. Creamy and smooth with a subtle warming effect.
D: A very nice beer, but it falls short of the hype for me. I'd get more if I saw it on the shelf, but I won't go out of my way to trade for it again. 677 charactersklewis, Jan 18, 2008

Smell has notes of bakers chocolate, coffee grounds, caramel, hay and a little must, with a hint of day old dirty socks as it warms, which I obviously don't care for! Actually, I assume that's the oak, in spite of how it comes across to me. 
Taste is strong, rich and super complex. Lots of roast, coffee grounds, only a slight touch of caramel sweetness and grassy hops, and alcohol on the bitter, dry finish. The label states it's brewed with licorice and molasses, but I can't say I particularly notice any of those flavors, a testament to how complex this is. It also states it's 33% aged in oak and oak bourbon barrels, and while I don't get any of the bourbon barrel flavors such as vanilla, there's plenty of oak, more so as it warms, even though I served this at cellar temp.
Mouthfeel is very thick and creamy, very nice. 
Drinkability is pretty good, in that there is endless depth to this sucker, revealing a little more with each sip. On the other hand, it's so thick and rich, I'm sure most non-beer geeks would take one sip say whoa, to acrid, no thanks! I'll certainly have more of these, particularly once they age, but I'm not in a hurry to have another one tonight, or any beer for that matter. 
I bought 1 bottle of last years on my first weekend in town, before I heard the hype, by which time it was long gone. I still haven't touched that bottle and have been eagerly anticipating this year's release. Worth the wait, but I'm in store for quite a bit more waiting for the rest of this years stash, which needs more time to round out and soften. Although I wouldn't want it to get any oakier, which is clearly a risk. 1,806 charactersccrida, Jan 18, 2008
4.8/5  rDev +7.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Deschutes is a relative latecomer to exotica and extremes. While the other guys were adding boatloads of spice island voodoo, barrel aging in tropical hardwoods, and recreating recipes first recorded in hieroglyphics, Deschutes was just brewing beer. Their craft is largely dignified (Bond Street service notwithstanding) but still finds its place on Main Street, Cascadia, not Brussels-on-the-Nile. The Abyss was their first beer of its kind brewed with spices and aged in wood. And the alchemy worked. The Abyss is a sublime drinking experience, a noble beer. Yes, it's big. But this isn't just a bad boy beer. It's a bad boy beer that can beat the crap out of your bad boy beer. 
Its dominant expression is one of coffee. There's actually more coffee here than most espresso stouts, especially in the aroma. The head is also unusually dark, like bread crust on a loaf of dark rye. The molasses and licorice never step far enough forward to define themselves, preferring instead to mingle in the background. Likewise, the presence of alcohol is remarkably concealed. 
The body is as black as a beer gets - like a black hole in a glass. The mouthfeel is oily and plump. The finish and aftertaste are extended with a long dry wash of roast coffee bean. The finish shows great polish and is almost as good as the main taste profile preceding it. 
After enjoying a pint on draught and being utterly entranced by its considerable charms, I returned the next night to try it again - just to be sure. Perhaps not surprisingly, the keg was tapped out. So I bought a bottle ($10.50 at the bar) and took it home. The bottled version was not as transcendent as the draught though still exquisite. The finish was less regal and more brief, and the flavor a bit more charred. I noted very little yeast at bottle's bottom. 
But in both instances The Abyss proved itself as among the best beers anywhere. It is a champion. A Gretzky, a Man 'o War. The stuff beer dreams are made of. Can't wait for next year. 1,999 charactersRedDiamond, Jan 16, 2008

First taste brings coffee to the front, creamy bitter chocolate through the middle with more coffee. The finish has a great subtle hop bitterness. Roasted malt feel to the finish. Mouthfeel is sublime, not too thin, but if anything I would like it to be slightly thicker. Drinkability is remarkably high for an impy stout. The 11% is nowhere to be found. Awesome brew, and I am excited to do a vertical of the two vintages one of these years. 594 charactersAKBelgianBeast, Jan 16, 2008

2006 vintage thanks to lou91 courtesy of the "Roll Out the Barrel BIF".
22 oz. bottle poured into a nonic.
Pours the darkest of dark with a big two finger fluffy mocha colored head. Loads of stickiness left on the sides of the glass after this one slowly descends. A thick and creamy head remains atop the Abyss throughout. This is how a beer should look. The smell on this one is damn powerful. Big chocolate and coffee up front with a sweet cherry, vanilla, and fig aroma as well. Lots of molasses and brown sugar with an unfortunate booze like smell that appears. The bourbon and oak are definitely there, but that's expected. Enough already, time to put this one down. Wow, first word that comes to mind after first sip is "complex" for sure. Wood smoked dark chocolate with a big french roast burst up front. The barrel aging of this beer truly shines. An almost Amaretto sweetness finds it's way out from underneath the big smokey flavor. Big oaky dry aftertaste with lingering dark fruites on the tongue. I really want this beer to be heavier, but it's still damn thick. Mild carbonation fits the style just right. I'll choose this over Dark Lord for sure, but it really is a toss up between The Abyss and Kate. Big thanks again goes out to lou91, unexpected treat for sure. I look forward to how a fresh "2007" version compares. 1,489 charactersBeerTruth, Jan 15, 2008

This beer has had a great deal of hype in my circle, and yet some how managed to exceed all my expectations. I had a friend say that it was the best stout ever brewed and after trying it I can honestly say he's not far off. 
This beer pours like crude motor oil, about as dark and thick as it gets. I was surprised by the brownish head that reached higher in height then the beer in the glass, amazing, as some stouts seem to be low in carbonation not this one! Maybe the wax has a role in not letting any air escape although its a bitch to cut off.
The taste is simply divine, dark espresso and bitter chocolate flavors mix with a hint of the oak barrels. This being an imperial stout and having such a high ABV, I was surprised that I really didn't taste any sweetness and hardly noticed that I was quited sauced after just one glass. This beer is really a symphony of its complexities, and I myself will from this day forward refer to it as the best stout ever brewed and you should to! 1,058 charactersnbree00, Jan 13, 2008

The bottle has this andy goldworthy de young museum thing going. The wax is annoying but worth the effort.
Pours an opaque dark coffee black, a nice looking head on it that falls into tan lacing around the glass. I put a mag light up to it and it didnt shine through. If you stare into the Abyss long enough the Abyss stares back at you. (cliche?)
I must suck, I usually can smell things, I couldnt smell anything in this besides the oak, coffee, chocolate, molasses, and a little vanilla. 
Tastes immediately of cocoa, vanilla, then warms up to coffee, chocolate, roasted malts. You can taste the oak coming through.
Great lingering aftertastes of coffee/expresso, not much carbonation. Just a well rounded beautiful beer that leaves you with an amazing lip smacking aftertaste. The alcohol and bourbon taste comes through in the end, but very sweet. The abyss will bite you like mike tyson and your ear.

Aroma is heavenly: molasses, brown sugar, and caramel with dark-roasted coffee and bittersweet chocolate present. Green, herbal hops are still evident revealing how massive this beer is in every direction.
Whoa baby, this is rich! Like Italian-roast coffee beans dipped in molasses then rolled in cocoa powder. Hints of wood, vanilla, and bourbon are faint but present and become more forward as it reaches room temperature. A burnt grainy edge and and herbal hop bitterness (maybe some of the licorice talking?) balance out the massive sweetness.
Huge, slick mouthfeel is so luxurious that while not drinkable in the traditional sense, it wouldnt have stopped me from opening another bomber if Id had one. Enough alcohol warmth to noticeably dry out the chewiness. Watching the snow fall outside my window on Christmas Day while enjoying this creation is a rich experience indeed.

2006 Reserve
a: The pour into a small snifter produces a gorgeous one finger dark mocha head. A slow recession leaves a nice layer and ring around the glass. A quick swirl of the glass easily revives the head. The beer is essentially black in color.
s: Upfront is a range of roasted espresso and bittersweet chocolate malts complimented by a smooth vanilla oak presence...very creamy and very well rounded. Gentle licorice and candied booze notes in the background. Strong note of cherries soaked in brandy, coated in very dark chocolate. In regards to the effects of the barrel aging, the oak takes center stage while the bourbon lurks in the back. Reserved complexity is key here.
m: Excellent mouthfeel, with a lusciously full body carried by a perfect, gentle level of carbonation. Love that it's full and smooth without being overdone.
t: Where to start...every component of the beer seems to be nearly flawlessly stitched together. Rich, earthy bittersweet chocolates melt into flavors of oaked vanilla and smooth roasted barley. Perfect level of sweetness. Great earthy hop presence supports the malt while allowing all the complexity to come through, adding a gentle to moderate bitterness in the looong roasty espresso finish. Creamy, complex, excellent.
d: Even when warm, the ABV is never more than a compliment. An excellent beer for a cold winter night.

4.23/5  rDev -5.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5THIS REVIEW IS ONLY FOR THE 2006 AND 2007 YEARS. THIS BEER IS GOING DOWNHILL AND THE 2009 VERSION OF NOT GOOD. I GAVE THOSE TWO EDITIONS A 4.75
Been opening up a few treasures over the last few days. 
Beautiful, beautiful pour. Black with cascading leathery foam and a perfect amount of bubbles capping off an inch or two dark tan head. Just gorgeous. 
Smell, and taste, is more complex than one expects. The two beers this most reminds me of are the Stone RIS (but with hops), and the Storm King (with more coffee, and a much more complex flavor).
Bitter coffee, espresso-like, and some roasted chocolate ... but not as much as you would think. Heavy pine/grapefruit hop content, roasted fruit, and some wood-sy flavors such as oak. The basic stout/caramel/toffee/roasted-ness is very understated and balances superbly. The bottle says molasses, but it tastes more like aged, semi-sweet rum. Yummy. Mouthfeel is appropriately thick and chewy. 
One of my new favorite beers.
I'D GIVE THE 2008, AND PARTICULARLY THE 2009, EDITIONS MUCH LOWER SCORES. IT JUST ISN'T THE SAME BEER ANYMORE. I'D GIVE THOSE VERSIONS AROUND A 3.75-4.0 I'LL AVERAGE AND GIVE IT A 4.25. 1,166 charactersOverlord, Dec 18, 2007
4.63/5  rDev +3.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Finally gave in and opened my bottle of 2006 Abyss. I was hoping to wait until the 07 was released and do a vertical tasting, but.. oh well, here goes...
Poured into a snifter, pitch black with a very dark brown head that settles very quickly. Smell is mainly brown sugary sweet, along with oak, and licorice notes. As it warms i notice increasing amounts of cocoa. Taste? WOW! Taste is surprisingly more chocolate/cocoa than i expected, along with toasted malt, and faint licorice flavors. I'm glad the licorice is as faint as it is because i generally dislike licorice flavors in my beer. Mouthfeel is very thick, almost syrupy. Smooth with a capitol "ooth". A truly memorable beer, though I couldn't see drinking more than a bomber in this sitting. It's so flavorful, and at 11% abv, it would probably sneak up on me rather quickly. This is a beer to be sipped and savored. 877 charactersBigJTrucker, Dec 16, 2007
4.5/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Vintage 2006
Pours opaque black, with a brown, rocky head that reluctantly swells up to the surface. A good inch-plus of dense foam at the peak before decention. Thick webbing of lacework clings to the glass like brown cobwebs.
Aromatics are loaded with rich chocolate, kona roast, and brownie batter. Slightly warming in the nose with a faint oaky dryness.
The mouthfeel is thick and chewy, but not overly so. Incredibly smooth and silky.
Intense chocolate and espresso on the pallet. Probably the most chocolate I've ever tasted in an RIS. Fudgy and decadent. 
Hopping is subdued and there's no bitterness to speak of or citrusy resins. 
What follows through on each sip though, is such a well integrated beer. Everything seems so balanced for having such large flavor components. Melded.
A faint bourbon note as well as some slight oak come through on the exhale. 
Finishes warming, chocolaty, and with a hint of viniosity.
A terrific beer, but it could use some heavier blending with more of the barrels. A bit subdued in that aspect. 1,039 charactersbrewandbbq, Nov 19, 2007

This one came as an EXTRA in a trade with younger35, now you know why I love the guy. He's a great trader who deals in nothing but good brews! I have held it back a few months to save it for review number 200. Well today is the day so I will bring you...Review 200!
A: Peel back the wax and pop the cap. It pours deep dark and thick. This one is darker than the richest cup of espresso. A thunderous milky cocoa head bolts from the bottle and dies down to a nice thin layer across the top. Lacing, yeah there's lacing. This beer begs to be drunk.
S: So nice and complex. Big bold chocolate comes right at you as soon as you crack the bottle. Once poured into the glass other aromas really come bounding forward. Fresh roasted dark coffee and licorice come out as well. Hints of vanilla and hazelnuts hide beneath a dash of brown sugar. Man I have never smelled brownie batter so nice.
T: I love a good RIS and this one is at least two levels above good. I was hooked by the aromas, but the taste really hammers in what a quality brew this is. When I tell you to expect chocolate, I mean to expect chocolate. I have never tasted something so fondue like. I could dip strawberries in this beer and eat them all night long. The bitter espresso hides beneath with tones of French Vanilla. Hazelnuts and brown sugar also make their appearance known as does a dash of charcoal.
M: Nice and thick. This one coats your mouth, throat, and stomach better than Pepto Bismol.
D: Uber, If I could buy this one by the case I would drink it bomber after bomber all winter long.
Overall: Daniel I am indebted to you for this one. It's not the best RIS in the world (though it doesnt fall short by much) but it is the most drinkable. The wonderful flavors meld together so perfectly that I just kept knocking it down in huge gulps. I actually had to tell my self to slow down and enjoy. Deschutes makes great beer, and this one is touted as their best. Well let me say I have to agree. If they never make another beer, they will be able to making a living on this beer alone.

2.98/5  rDev -33.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 2.5 | feel: 2.5 |  overall: 2.5I revisted this one last night from the bottle, and wow what a dissapointment. I must have been high as a kite when I wrote my first review, as this stuff is just not good. On the pour this beer looks great. Dark black/cola brown with a coffee whip espresso head of foam. Aromas are good too, slight chocolate, coffee, roasetd malts. Nice. However the taste is fine up front, but this is too sweet in the middle and the chocolate/coffee/roast flavors just turn to acrid bitter cold brewed coffee in the sour finish. Also, the mouthfeel is thin for an imperial stout. The thin mouthfeel and bad sour coffee aftertaste of overburnt espresso beans really kills the drinkability for this one. Maybe a bad bottle? Maybe, but it was fresh from the most recent release in a wax dipped 22oz bomber, so it seems unlikely. Not good. 822 charactersfrancisweizen, Nov 15, 2007

This was a 2006 bottle I have been sitting on for almost a year and I figured it was time to drink up and give it a half-assed review. This was the second time I had this beer and all I remember from the first ingestion was that it was good. This too was pretty damned good. Black color, small tan head, and smells like licorice and chocolate. The taste is more licorice, chocolate, excellent. The alcohol is non-existent until the beer is gone and then it sneaks up, good thing I didn't drink the whole bottle. The mouthfeel is sticky and slightly thick but not quite as thick as Dark Lord. Good job Deschutes.
-2007 bottle-02/23/2008
green, meaning green apples (acetylaldehyde?) and odd, licorice taste and as it warmed a nice choco-ashen flavor, syrupy, too expensive. I preferred the 2006 to this so I will let my remaining bottles cellar...
-2007 vintage 11/03/08
Smells like a nice hefty, roasty RIS with a good dose of alcohol and a touch of malted milk balls. The taste is bitter, like old and cold coffee, gritty and grainy. As it warms up it gets better but seems to have a tough edge to it.

4.67/5  rDev +4.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.522oz. bottle
Poured an opaque, black/brown color. Some mahogany/ruby tones at the edge when held up to light. It was capped by a small, creamy brown head which dissipated quickly. Very nice legs, not much in the lacing department.
Lots going on in the aroma department. Chocolate. A sweet/nutty smell - molasses/peanut brittle. The obligatory coffee/roast notes, faint at first, but increasing as temperature rises. Then the interesting stuff starts to kick in -- vanilla/oak, bourbon, licorice. Finally, some cinnamon.
Taste reminded me a bit of GI Bourbon County Stout, just not as sweet initially and a whole lot more hops in the finish than I recalled. Starts off with a lot of molasses/caramel flavor. Chocolate comes through. As you finish, bourbon and pine hops show up, coupled with more of the roast notes. All of it combines for a nice, lingering, bitter finish.
This was a heavy, viscous, coating kind of body. It had very low carbonation which yielded a very smooth drink. Quite dry, almost astringent finish initially. This improved vastly as it warmed up. Very important to give this one some counter time prior to drinking if you had it in the fridge.
Overall, very comlex and completely enjoyable. Met my expectations then blew right by them. 1,263 characters, Nov 06, 2007
4.32/5  rDev -3.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Served on the warm side of cool. The beer pours with a frothy, easily three-finger thick, creamed, chocolate brown colored head that sits atop an opaque, pitch black colored brew. Aromas of oak and concentrated, burnt malt waft to my nose as I pour this brew. The first draught of the aroma yield ample roast malt character that makes me think of dark-roasted espresso beans, chocolate malt ball candies, burnt caramel and a huge, toasted malt character that is coupled with an über-nutty aromatic note. The aroma is quite rich and expressive, the roast malt character clearly dominates. It is interesting that I was able to smell the oak as I was pouring, but it gets mostly buried under all of the dark malt aromatics when going in for a more dedicated smelling of the aroma. Having said that the aroma does yield some subtle oak aromatics, including a touch of spicy wood, some soft butterscotch and a hint of a woody backdrop.
Creamy feeling up front, yet somehow still fairly drinkable & light. After the first sip has left my mouth, the finish at first is roast malt dominated then moves to a spicy oak character, but then a sweet, burnt fruit character becomes noticeable and then it seems to start over again. This has a very long finish and it seems to move between roast grain notes, light oak character and a rich, concentrated fruitiness. Quite interesting, and I haven't even taken a second sip yet. Sweet tasting up front, obviously contributed by an ample malt character (burnt caramel notes); the sweetness accentuates a bright (though clearly roasted), concentrated, fruit character that runs throughout this beer. It also accentuates a deep, dark chocolate character that melds quite well with the silky texture. The burnt fruit notes remind me of raisins, prunes and, especially towards the finish, of cherries. The oak is really not noticeable until just before the finish where it shows up as a spicy oak character. It might contribute some soft vanilla notes & perhaps a touch of butterscotch, but these notes really serve to accentuated the malt character rather than really jump out on their own.
Serving this beer so warm (about 65°F / 18°C) has really muted the oak contribution, as the last time I had this it was much more noticeable. Even when cooler it is still on the subtle side though, which is really what I want in a beer made with oak; add a bit more to the complexity without over doing it is the only way to go. The proof that this is a very well made stout is that despite the over the top roast character, there is very little harsh acidity contributed by all of the roasted grains. Definitely not the thickest and richest Imperial Stout out there, but still this is quite satiating and I really like how the various flavor components of this brew balance each other out. This is simply quite delicious; lots of sweet malt & fruit notes to stand up to the over the top roast character, plus a subtle backdrop of oak to kick the complexity up another notch. 3,001 charactersGueuzedude, Oct 24, 2007
4.9/5  rDev +9.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5This beer pours a jet black color, with a dark brown head. The head fades slowly, leaving a massive lacing. No light shines through when thie beer is held up to the light.
The aroma of this beer is very complex. I smell bourbon first. Then I pick up coffee, and chocolate. Some dark fruit aromas are also present. Raisins, plumbs, and figs. This beer has a sweet caramel malty aroma as well. It has a slight alcohol aroma. All the aromas I associate with Russian Imperial Stouts are present in this one.
This beer tastes exactly like it smells. some bourbon, coffee, chocolate, dark fruit, and alcohol. This beer is quite complex.
This beer is very full bodied. It leaves a bourbon like and coffee like aftertaste. The carbonation is low, fitting the style to perfection. The alcohol content warms my throat slightly as it goes down.
I doubt this beer would make a great session beer. It is high in alcohol, and the flavor is a bit aggressive.
Overall: Wow, this beer is everything I expected and more. If I see it around, I will buy it up. Thank you HimerMan for this gem. 1,078 charactersOStrungT, Oct 21, 2007
4.56/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Where many, and more "Russian" imperial stouts try to whelm the palate with complexity and variation in taste, Deschutes take a more somber, more "American" type of attitude when it comes to the style. Its classic American-ized taste makes in drier, less fruity and less spicy taste. Yet it makes the beer better? Here's why...
The pitch black concoction pours like 30 weight motor oil as it layers into the snifter. Seeming like the beer wouldn't develop a head, several more seconds are needed to appreciate the coffee-like creme that slowly forms on top of the stout. Not known for significant lace, the beer is caught somewhere between becoming a frothy, heady beer and a still, brandy-like appearance.
The nose melts the senses as the aroma of strong espresso, cocoa, and burnt toffee seduces the olfactory senses at every turn. Roasted walnut, light campfire, near-bourbon alcohols and savory sherry notes of aging come to live as the aromas search for complexity and the beer warms to release its pleasantries.
Flavors are even bolder as the beer builds and its power is felt- giving an intense espresso-rich, bitter chocolate early taste while bourbon-like vanilla melds into the caramel malt taste. The complexities are rich and varying and do offer only a glimpse into berry, plumb, and fig flavor, if only for a second. Walnut oils and coffee oils seem to give the beer its bitter balance even though we know they are hop-derived.
It's ultra-thick and weighted feel offers a creamy buffer, especially with its deeply embedded carbonation. Finishing very warm, lightly tangy, and thinned by alcohol, the its lingering finish satisfies the sweet tooth with dessert-like satisfaction. 
Even without the high rate of complexity, the simple richness of Abyss lives up to its name- offering up a one-dimensional dialogue of roast and sweet while only glimpses of complexity decorate the periphery. But its such a succulent and delicious taste that those complexities are simply not needed. 1,999 charactersBEERchitect, Oct 04, 2007
3.97/5  rDev -11.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5App: Pours pitch black, the darkest black I've seen in a stout, with a slight lacing that slides down the sides of the glass. The brown head lasts for awhile, but not as long as I would have liked.
Smell: Very fruity in the way of cherries and strawberries and somewhat chocolatey too. There's a slight hint of vanilla which I enjoy and an overall pleasant essence of graham cracker. Quite nice.
Taste: Graham cracker sticks out first with a nice coffee addition. The dark chocolate hits towards the swallow with a blast of vanilla and oak.
Mouthfeel: Moderately bitter, smooth and silky all combine with the airy aftertaste to impress me. I would have liked some hop presence with this too, but it has been aging a little while.
Drinkability: Goes down easily, but lacks an extra insentive to get again and again. 818 charactersdbalsock, Sep 29, 2007
4.97/5  rDev +10.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This one pours a deep, opaque black color with a creamy and frothy light brown, chocolate milk colored head that disappears to leave no evidence whatsoever that it ever existed. Smell is of bread, cookie, toasted malt, molasses, dark coffee... the list goes on and on. With every sip and every moment this nectar was able to breathe more aromas are released. I sat down to fully appreciate this beer and I must have spent five good minutes just smelling, sniffing, and wafting this great brew. Taste is aroma magnified times 10, with almost all of the scents now on my tongue. As this one warms up in my hand I taste sweet caramel, toasted malt, sweety cookies, dark cacao, espresso. Absolutely one of the finest stouts ever. Body is full with a creamy texture, almost silky with a nice amount of carbonation. 
If you ever get a chance to enjoy this beer, do so immediately. I would love another bottle of this, but don't know if I will ever see one again! 957 charactersgenog, Sep 24, 2007

4.37/5  rDev -2.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Got this bottle in trade from Alaska. Thankee Edgelow.
I didn't expect a beer called "Abyss" to be anything other than deepest black, and that's pretty much what this is. In my glass it looks like ink topped with a rapidly fading cinnamon-brown head. Pretty.
Ahh, now we get to it! The Abyss has a heckuva nose. Rich chocolate cake, cocoa powder, oak-wood, espresso, and a sweet roastedness pervades everything. I'm also picking up a dirty, earthy smell and molasses, finished off by considerable alcohol heat. Yummy.
The flavor is primarily deep coffee and cocoa, tastes "organic" if that makes any sense. Pure, I suppose. Molasses and rich, lingering bittersweet cocoa in the finish. The alcohol is cunningly hid behind the coffee-cocoa assault, but you know it's there. The mouthfeel is slick, lowly carbonated, sticky and chewy. Finishes dry and with the same experience you get if you chew a handful of coffee beans. Nice. I'm not tasting much oak character, though.
Drinkable? It's a fine sipping beer, yes. Much like it's older, eviler cousin Dark Lord; I don't require more than 6 ounces of this at a time. Take a while to drink and study this one. Best savored inside a log cabin fireplace in Oregon while Old Man Winter howls outside, angry that he can't share in your coffee-booze delight that is Abyss.
Ultimately, the Abyss didn't grab me like it apparently does everyone else. It's merely Very Good. Still, gets my unqualified recommendation as one of the better Russian Imperial Stouts out there. 1,516 characterskkipple, Sep 18, 2007
4.58/5  rDev +2.2%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Incredibly lucky to find that they had this available in the beer tasting room at the LA County fair (didn't last long I don't think - got a glass at about 7PM, was no longer there at 8:30). 12oz pour for $5 - I'd say that's the best deal I've ever seen at a fair!
Pours a ridiculously black black with a 1/2 finger dark tan head that does stay around nicely. This beer just looks beautiful.
Smell is of tons of chocolate and roasted flavors. Loving it.
Taste is delicious. Dark chocolate. Milk chocolate. Coffee. More chocolate. Touch of nice hop bitterness to perfectly balance the sweets. Oh man, this thing is dessert in a glass. The balance here is truly exceptional. This is how I like my stouts.
Mouthfeel is so rich yet so smooth, lending an amazing drinkability to such a potent beer. The alcohol is only really tasted in a nice bourbon warmth sort of way - nice.
Wonderful, wonderful beer. Deschutes knows how to brew (and oak age). Highly recommended. Shall revisit soon hopefully! 997 charactersrallison, Sep 13, 2007
4.73/5  rDev +5.6%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5One pint 6 fluid oz.s (of black deliciousness), 2006 reserve, aged in French oak and bourbon barrels. The bottle black, a black wax seal, the label an earthy brown with a crack (the abyss, apparently) down the middle. Visual translation: not f'ing around.
To begin with, a foreshadowing if you will, one must chip away at the black wax seal to even get a proper grip to remove the cap. Pouring into a tulip glass, black as oil even when held to a light, the two finger head a dark tan, frothy, bubbly, long lasting. The lacing is left all around the glass, in small splotches, long streaks, rambling amoebas, as though leaving behind traces of destruction, its perfect.
The aroma is all kind of dark, roasted goodness. Smoky, roasted malts are used wantonly, chocolates abound, bourbon soaked cherries and figs and charred coffee grounds stinging the nose, and I like it. 
The taste defines the phrase, 'instant classic.' Its a mean one, serious, gripping... again, not f'ing around. A complex, intricate, evolving beast of palatable proportions. Roasted malts are in huge abundance, black as midnight malts, slightly oaky, the bourbon influence no fleeting thing yet only in flavor, not biting or bracing, only its warmth. Pounds of bittersweet chocolate, vanilla, molasses and dark fruits swirl around, tumbling into oblivion (or maybe thats my sobriety...).
The mouth is full, smooth, slightly chewy even, carbonated to the slightest degree, hardly noticeable but ever effective, the alcohol presence very much present and warming. The finish is long and drawn out, leaving me to consider what I'll have to do to acquire a bottle of next year's batch. And I must say, though I have no base of reflection, it has in fact (and coinciding with rumor) peaked, so, as my best bud would say, "Drrrink up, fuckers!!"
Of the fantastic uber-stouts I've had recently, Surly Darkness easily rank as my favorite, AleSmith Speedway Stout an honorable second, and this third. I chose this one as I pass onto 450th review, 800th karma point, and to celebrate a month till my wedding. Hopefully, I'll have a Dark Lord to celebrate next month... the Abyss, and Dark Lord, how appropriate. :)
Thanks go to RoBotGod for this one. 2,219 charactersobjectivemonkey, Sep 09, 2007

Smells of pure chocolate, roasted malts.
Tastes is an astounding chocolate bomb. I've eaten 82% chocolate that wasn't as dark as this. I'd imagine that a bar of chocolate would pale in comparison. There are lots of dark roasted malts and a lingering slightly bitter aftertaste that just won't go away. 
Mouthfeel is thick and creamy, smooth and silky.
I split a bomber with a buddy and don't think I could have finished the whole thing myself. There are very few beers I can say that about. 613 characterskirok1999, Sep 05, 2007
4.82/5  rDev +7.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 52006 Reserve purchased in Anchorage in June 2007. Served at 55 degrees F.
Pitch black body with dark brown used motor oil edges. Small, but persistent, cocoa brown head. Nose of peat, intense coffee, oaky smokiness, creme brulee, dark dark chocolate, with a sweetish blend of dark fruits, and a dash of bitter hop aroma. Wow, very nice!
Toasted bitterness and roasted malt start off this delicious brew. Sweetness via dark, whiskeyish fruits and molasses comes next with intense dark and milk chocolate bitternessweetness and notes of licorice. There's an oaky depth to all of it that is subtle but unmissable. As the bourbon warmth picks up, the hop bitterness and malty roastedness intensify. Finish is warming with lingering hop numbness. Fantastic! Full, chewy body with perfect carbonation. Dangerously drinkable, but should be savored slowly from a big snifter. Well done Deschutes! 894 charactersalexgash, Aug 24, 2007

T- Unbelievable. Dark roasted grains dominate with coffee, chocolate, sweet malt, molasses... mmm. The dark roast of the grains balances perfectly with the sweetness of the malt, and it's wonderful.

4.05/5  rDev -9.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4I pulled a 22oz bomber out of the cellar after a long, cold and rainy day fly fishing for King Salmon in Douglas AK. Man 'o' man did I need a warmup . . . Found it right here. Great, wonderfully thick inky darkness fueled with higher alcohols leading to an amazing chocolate character. VERY NICE! I expected a little more oak though . . . it seems that aging in barrels would have given it a little more oomf (vanilla). I think I'll sit on the other bottle I have a little while longer for more proper aging purposes.

4.87/5  rDev +8.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.52006. The pour of the Abyss was, well, black. Thick and still, with a big tan head resting atop it. Smell was quite complex, possibly moreso than any other beer I've put my nose to. Huge roasted malts. Coffee, vanilla, licorice, bourbon, and a hint of chocolate among the madness, though there is a method to the madness. Taste is unbelievable also. A nice roasted coffee up front, followed by a woody bourbon flavor that comes with a slight burn. I notice the molasses and licorice in there as well. Basically perfect aside from a slight lack in balance. There is a lot going on, possibly too much to keep it perfectly in place. Mouthfeel is big and warm. I'd love to have a few bottles for the winter. This would be ideal for sitting around the fire on cold day. Drinkability is good. This isn't one of those beers that I could drink a lot of because I feel it requires consuming slowly for better enjoyment (and safety). One bomber is fine with me. Still, a very unique and well done beer from Deschutes. They know how to make some damn beer!

And then, of course, I flew from Oregon to Texas to drink it there for some crazy reason - so it'd been through a lot by the time I got to it. Not to worry, it was absolutely amazing. It poured out dark black with a nice head of brown bubbles. Very very aromatic with hints of chocolate, coffee and a distinct alcohol smell expected of an imperial. The taste was a bit like cherry or berry up front and then exploded into an amazing blend of chocolate/coffee/sour/oak tastes. Very complex. The mouthfeel was fantastic too - though it was a bit hard going down. It would be a hard beer to drink more than one bottle of, just because it's so heavy and rich.

Drank outside on a cool sunny day.Dark as can be  being held to the sun itself revealed no light whatsoever passing through. Pours an oily blackness with a thick foamy long-lasting head that leaves a very sticky lacing.
Roasted coffee aroma and taste with some woody flavors as well as molasses and a hint of licorice. Very creamy with a silky, smooth. mouthfeel.
The high abv is nearly completely masked. A great imperial stout and another very nice offering from Deschutes.
UPDATE 2/1/2013: remarkably my spouse was cleaning out a garage pantry last week and came across a bottle of 2006. I drank 1/3 of it this afternoon. It was remarkable. Slightly subdued flavors but insanely increased smoothness. If you have any 2006 still in cellar, don't fear it's possible demise; it is criminally smooth and a still great experience. 961 charactersricke49, Jun 28, 2007

Pours a dark almost black color with only a small head. I commented on how good it looked in the glass.
Smell is roasty. Very roasty with some molasses coming through as well.
Taste is much the same. All Im getting is lots of roastiness. No bourbon barrel or barrel aging coming through at all. It was smooth and creamy, yet a tad thin on mouthfeel. Wasnt getting the plethora of complexity that was advertised. Ill sit on the last few and let them age for awhile and see if they balance out more. 534 charactersFtownThrowDown, Jun 22, 2007
4.58/5  rDev +2.2%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Thick vicious pour thats incredible to watch unfold its heft into the chalice. Sits black and thick as newly wettened tar and caps the top with a roof of dark brown foam that's thick, spongy, and lush. Inky glared stings of lace fling about after each sip.
Aroma is thick and oaky with a dark chocolate heft over a tang of rich molasses, cherry, fig, and the ever present oaky bourbon scent that helps add a bit a of wondefully fulfilling, nose whirling, heat. Trace of burnt coffee ensues with a nice addition to the profile.
Taste is immaculately woven with dark chocolate and a smoothly thick, lush body tranfused with all sorts of vanilla, molasses, coffee, and bourbon oakyness. A very well balanced and heavy treat. The chocolate is tenderly bittered with the heat and quite dark in its efforts. Anything and everything dark from the cocoa bean has been placed in every inch of its flavor. Spiced with a touch of peppery hops, coffee, and a terrific, if not down right perfect notion of bourbon hints wavered all throughout the chocolatey body.
This is some pretty thick stuff, noticed in the pour, felt on the palate, and rendered in the gut. Smooth and velvety, thick, lush, and firm with a great creamy sense of chocolate and cream. Nice feathery spiced finish that stays creamy and enduced within a deep, darl chocolatey depth thats quite incredible to behold. It really makes a solid impression.
A supurb stout!! Wonderfully thick, chocolatey, and lasting with a great impression of a well made brew. Deschutes has themselves a big time winner with this one! Wow! 1,586 characterstavernjef, Jun 21, 2007

Pours a midnight crude oil blackness with a soapy and thick foamy milk chocolate colored head. Nice retention with sticky thick lacing already forming. Dark chocolate notes lend a sweetness to the nose. Roasted malt and black patent malt play a nice supporting role. Waves of coffee, molasses, and thick caramel round out the malt profile. Hops are spicy and slightly noticeable underneath the heavy handed malt.
Thick and syrupy body runs across the palate like sludge. Sweet nestle chocolate flavors that also have a sharp bitterness to them. Caramel sweetness also impressive. Roasted malt notes with coffee, rum soaked dark fruit, molasses, and licorice. Many flavors dance on the taste buds and shout to be noticed. Bitterness is actually quite abundant in the finish accompanied by blackstrap molasses notes. Dry finish from that blackstrap. Smooth and easy drinking, though this ones a sipper with it's high abv, which is completely masked. 1,025 charactersbjohnson, Jun 18, 2007
4.57/5  rDev +2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4This is a pretty damn good stout. Thanks to Crosling for sending it as part of a trade. Very rich and absolutely full of flavor.
The beer pours to an inky black color with a smallish brown head. Retention is fairly poor, as to be expected for such a high ABV brew. Lacing is very spotty, but manages to stick a little.
The smell is great. Chocolate and coffee with an underlying sweet caramel and toffee. A gentle alcohol aroma burns the nostrils, lending a nice spice to the equation. Smells fairly hoppy as well, like a New World blend of an Old World hop, maybe Magnum for instance, but the malts really steal the show with this one, as they should.
The taste is very faithful to the nose, though greatly intensified. The increased sensory perception leads to a nice oak tannin flavor in the early finish that lingers on with a great chocolate and coffee roast. The alcohol is there, but at just the right level where it improves the flavor rather than detracts from it. Very sweet and roasty with a chalky, vanilla barrel char and chocolatey coffee roast finish that lingers forever. The molasses and brewer's licorice mentioned on the bottle are easy to discern. The hops are just intense enough to add a very subtle herbal spice that accents the stout very well, and to be able to taste them in such a rich beer means that there were tons used in the kettle.
The body is quite thick and sticky. Fairly sweet. The alcohol can be tasted, but it's not intense and burning, though rather smooth instead. Very easy to drink for a big beer. I can see why it is so highly rated. 1,589 charactersneonbrown82, Jun 08, 2007

22 Ounce Bottle sealed in black wax. 
Pours into a snifter just about as black as beers get. Totally opaque and all that. A very large, dark brown head rises from body. It remains bubbly for some time. Lace flecks dot the edges of the glass. The body looks increasingly oily.
A unique aroma of Honey Nut Cheerios ascends from the glass. Aside from that are the expected chocolate and coffee aromas, this time off course by the truck load. Im quite pleased that Im not finding any bourbon and just some nice hints of oak, mostly in the form of cherry and vanilla.
Flavor is a marvelous rush of chocolate and coffee. No hint of booze until it fully reaches room temperature and even then, the ABV is still well disguised. Mild notes oaken notes of Vanilla and a general fruit sweetness balance the bitter chocolate. Light amounts of maple and smoke.
Oily and full body. Leathery at times. Balanced but not without some hefty bitterness. 
Drinkable in an extreme way, especially for such a big beer. I wish I had more of this. Its delicious. 1,138 charactersDaPeculierDane, Jun 03, 2007
5/5  rDev +11.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Pours a completley opaque, oil-thick black blackness that's like nothing at all, it's so goddamn black, and top of it there's this wonderful brown head.
Smells of perfectly balanced and mellowed RIS flavors. They all combine in these fuckers like a goddamn monkey house full of apes and chimps who spend all day swinging on vines and interbreeding and throwing their feces atop of anyone foolish enough to peer inside. Only this ain't feces, my man. This is tasty goodness.
Tastes like burnt chocolate, hot chocolate, milk chocolate, sweet barley malt, bitter barley malt, rich wholegrain bread, sour malt, lightly alcoholic yeast, that fizzy chocolate candy they used to sell at the dime store back when there were dime stores, vanilla beans, generic fruit, and an end of bitterdry west coast hops. In short, it tastes like everything a beer should taste like, all at once, all perfectly balanced.
Wow. Better than Dark Lord. 929 charactersmynie, May 31, 2007
4.33/5  rDev -3.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Friend of mine went to the brewery last September and wanted to get a growler of something that we couldn't get in Tucson. Was told they had a Russian Imperial Stout that was currently only on tap and thus a growler of this was delivered to my desert doorstep. Review was written and put away for a day when the beer was released and on BA.
Appearance is akin to the sky under a new moon, just midnight black. Tint of dark ruby when held towards light. Notes here also describe "damn good solid brown head". Smell is a subtle blend; malt, molasses, espresso and vinous notes are all apparent.
Tastes are also well balanced, including the sweet malt and molasses playing against a light espresso roast bite and noticeable hops. Alcohol is perceptible, but barely so.
Drinkability is quite good for the style, I could go for 4 or 5 pints of this. Mouthfeel is a little thinner than ideal, could use a little more leg. Nice dry finish though.
BTW, the growler is beautiful, its probably the nicest I've seen, be sure to pick one up if you're in the Bend area. 1,068 charactersPooba001, May 17, 2007

Pours big and black with a thin brown film of bubbles. looks pretty badass. I can smell it in my glass from 3 feet away. coffee and chocolate, brandy and bourbon, and scotch and some dark fruits. Taste up front is a sweet dark fruitiness. extreme bitter coffee grounds then move in, along with some sour coffee bean-iness. obvious oaky flavor with familiar hints of vanilla. Dry coffee woodiness and bitterness on the finish. Flavor lingers and lingers. Just fantastic. Mouthfeel huge and velvetlike. The only problem is that the coffee ground bitterness becaomes maybe one degree too harsh towards the end. But, anyway, a fantastic, humungous beer. 731 charactersaforbes10, May 14, 2007
3.28/5  rDev -26.8%look: 3.5 | smell: 3 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3Around $ 9.00 per bottle in Colorado. I cant appreciate subtlety in this style. Either smack me with hops (Yeti), blast me with oak (Bourbon County) or spank me with tons of malt (Expedition.) Its a good, drinkable beer, but I didnt find much complexity in my bottle. 
Another bottle: I drank this one warm and still cant get why you people like it. 358 charactersCrosling, May 13, 2007
4.36/5  rDev -2.7%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5I got this one from ArrogantB in a trade. 
Looks bright and lively for the style with a dark blackish brown and a rim of prune where the light could get through. The head was a beautiful dark tan but fell to a collar in no time.
Smells big and stick with gooey barley and honey. There seems to be a grassy raspberry in the middle somewhere that adds a lot of balance. Theres also a barbecue chicken smokiness in the background.
Tastes similar with the sticky barley, honey and raspberry but it then takes on a lot of smoke and roasted coffee. In the finish theres a warming, oaky, boozy alcohol that meshes well with a dry chocolate.
Feels light for the style but a bit sticky with a surprising dryness that accents the coffee character.
Very nice. Id like to see more RISs that rely more on smoke instead of sweet. Its light body and clean finish make this an excellent sipper. 899 charactersDarkerTheBetter, May 13, 2007

Pours very dark. One of those beers you have to pour in front of people so you can see that "You aren't going to drink that are you" face. 
Nice thick head but not over flowing with suds. Ring of lace lingered throughout my tasting.
Nose full of this tells you your in for a treat and your mouse begs for its turn.
Upfront caramelized maple flavor comes first followed by a sweet raisin flavor. Dig a bit deeper and the oak shows it's cards. 
I could drink this stuff all day and die happy in my sleep. 528 charactersSlats, May 08, 2007
4.75/5  rDev +6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Many thanks to RoBotGod for trading me this beer... This stout pours looking black as night, although you can tell it's not that thick. The head is a thin, dark reddish-tan topping things off nicely. 
Excellent aroma of roasty coffee, much like Founder's Breakfast Stout. The alcohol is not percieved and there is also a touch of vanilla oak sweetness. 
The first sip is pure heavenly joy, amazingly smooth with intense bitter roast flavors. Lots of fresh ground coffee bean, smoke, and a hint of chocolate. The finish is puckering and bitter. The mouthfeel is only slightly thick, very smooth again, with fine but strong carbonation. The oak aging has smoothed this out nicely making it easy to swallow. 
I'm amazed at how drinkable this sucker was. It seemed nothing like 11% at all. I really enjoy a stout that isn't overly sweet or thick, and this one fits the bill. I would seek this out if you can... 915 charactersbennetj17, Apr 19, 2007

If this thing is barrel aged, you sure cant tell unless you are looking for it. There is lots of chocolate, cocoa, hops. Quite a bit of hops actually. The barrel character comes through more in the flavor. Very chocolatey. Sort of reminds me of Whoppers in the flavor and gritty mouthfeel. Certainly a damn fine beer, but nothing outstanding. 455 characterstjthresh, Apr 18, 2007

a - pours like well-used motor oil, thick and black, one-to-two finger tan head with great retention and lacing, absolutely beautiful looking stout
s - bittersweet chocolate is dominant aroma, some burnt malts in the body, hints of oak and bourbon, slight alcohol notes
t - very smooth flavor, nice mix of dark chocolate and deeply roasted malt, slightly sweet, finish has quite a bit of oak and notes of bourbon, not much alcohol detectable outside the bourbon notes, but just enough to know it's there, so delicious
m - full-bodied and very creamy, coats the mouth well, mild carbonation, warming effect
d - so smooth for a big stout, alcohol is not harsh at all, easy on the palate but complex at the same time
Very complex and smooth RIS. One of my favorites and very nearly flawless. Had a Dark Lord the night before this and The Abyss is every bit as good in my opinion. While DL is more in your face and aggressive, this beer is more reserved and smooth but just as complex. Well worth seeking this one out. Here's to hoping Deschutes makes this an annual release. 1,136 charactersWeisGuy, Apr 15, 2007
4.43/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Classy looking bottle. The black wax covering the top and neck...the bold, minimal label...my snifter is eager to receive.
Nice big mocha head doesn't stay big long, but it stays in some capacity for a good while before crowning. Head color is a gorgeous mocha, on top of an impossibly black, yep, abyss. Great dark brown lace too!
Aroma is less heavy and more "bright" than I would expect...toffee wafts through first, and something that resembles those soft maple candies from Brach's...and a good round alcoholic edge in the background, which becomes more pronounced (and less attractive) as the very slight chill dissipates.
A most interesting flavor, true to style but also unlike any other in its class. Slight alcohol burn hits first, acting as a bed for the richer, finer flavors to come: toffee, dark chocolate, espresso, fresh cream, smoke, roasted nuts, and a finish that lays on the bitterness of unsweetened baking chocolate. [and whaddaya know, a nice healthy burp reveals those big ol' hops!]
Mouthfeel isn't overly thick, but it is ridiculously creamy...feels like pure liquid velvet in the mouth. No stickiness, no post-sip pasty-mouth. Awesome. 
Considering the combined flavor and mouthfeel, this has a breakfast-stout feel to it. And with such intense flavors and high ABV, it goes down incredibly clean and smooth. Thanks a ton to msubulldog25 for this fine specimen. You da man, Brian. 1,422 charactersMetalmonk, Mar 28, 2007

The body is nearly pitch black. Light barely penetrates the cap, reflecting back the mocha cap that is the creamy head.
Smell is mostly chocolate to my nose but there's some roastiness to it along with vanilla and just a hint of bourbon. 
Taste is mostly chocolate again but the bourbon shines through in a light and pleasing manner. Hints of vanilla and roasted malts round out this beautiful sipper.
Mouth feel is full and smooth with well rounded edges.
Drinkability is good. I could sip this all night long....and I just may since I poured the whole bomber into one glass.
As it warms, this becomes even more tasty, although the alcohol also shows itself more so drinkability doesn't improve...not that I'm complaining ;-) 893 charactersnflmvp, Mar 23, 2007

Gorgeous, silky smooth black color. Nice cocoa colored head on top. Really a nice looking beer. Deep, deep aroma-roasted malt and licorice. Somewhat fruity and caramel like. Thick roasted flavor. Black currants and licorice. Oakey with some great vanilla notes. Faint coffeeness to it. Very mellow sweetness. Perfect mouthfeel-doesnt finish too dry. No trace of any alcohol @ 11%.

4.25/5  rDev -5.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Pours oily black in color with an orangish tan head that slowly fades and leaves some light lacing. Nice roasty aroma, some light soft sugariness and some bourbony alcohol as well, but aroma is mainly a charred, burnt roastedness, coffee like. Very smooth and creamy as it hits the tongue. Again the sweet sugariness from the malts is quite soft and subtle but lingers slightly longer than in the aroma. Sweet sugariness has some light chocolate flavor and is followed by some acidity from the roastiness creeping in and growing stronger towards the finish. This acidic roastiness blends with some decent hop bitterness. An almost nutty roastiness in the finish as well as a decent amount of alcohol. Finishes dry with some alcohol burn at the back of the throat and an anise aftertaste. Very nice and roasty, extremely well balanced beer. Mouthfeel is great start to finish. Taste is solid and fairly complex. 910 charactershoppymeal, Mar 07, 2007
3.84/5  rDev -14.3%look: 5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Pours a DARK black color. Darkest beer I've ever seen! Forms a thin dark brown froth on the top.
Smells of smoky malt and like roasted coffee. Pacific northwestern Hops are in there, too.
Flavor starts off sweet, but then works it's way toward espresso and baker's chocolate. There's a little bit of spice in the finish. I think it's mainly due to the hops and maybe the licorice. As it warms, molasses starts to appear as well.
This brew is super thick, but that's good as it's a flavor bomb and needs that to keep it from seeming watery. 
It starts off drinking very easy, but as you work your way down, you begin to realize what you're in for. Still, for an 11% brew, it's still amazingly easy. Definitely drinks easier than the vast majority of RIS's.
Probably the most potent Imperial Stout I've ever had, too. It doesn't quite have the flavor variety and dept of some others, but it's still excellent. I think I'm just more of a fan of the sweeter malts and dried fruit character, while this beer is all about roasted coffee character. I respect this brew a ton, but my own personal tastes lean in a slightly different direction.
(Edit, 2/14/08) I just tried the 2007 vintage and I have to say that it's MUCH more in-line with my tastes. More molasses, caramel, milk chocolate, and vanilla. It's still a little pricey and rare, but worth looking for. 1,357 charactersDomingo, Mar 06, 2007

Smell has a hint of hops but this one seems more about the malt. I get plenty of roasty, chocolate-y, licorice and a bit of currants in the nose. Maybe even a little bit of oak and the slightest hint of vanilla. Taste seems to begin with some bittered chocolate and some licorice before dark fruit starts to come in, it ends up with a strong, roasty finish. I seem to get a bit of oak as well, some alcohol is noticeable too. Full bodied with carbonation on the lighter side; dry, roasty finish. This one is a sipper, but a damn good one. Definitely worth seeking out. 673 charactersbadbeer, Mar 04, 2007

The smell is chocolately with some coffee, the smell reminds me of a chocolate wafer. The taste is smooth and full flavor of coffee hits you right away and the chocolate is left to the aftertaste. There's a lot of burnt wood in the flavor as well, kinda like when you put charcoal from the fire in your mouth (by accident). The mouthfeel is very silky and full bodied, very nice. Overall I would have this again after aging it a year or so. 557 charactersErdinger2003, Mar 04, 2007
5/5  rDev +11.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Served at a slightly warm cellar temperature, sampled in celebration of getting my taxes done early this year. This looks absolutely incredible, with an epic burnt-sugar brown head, all creamy and dense and going nowhere fast. Cool reverse-cascade effect during the pour. The liquid itself blocks out any light source put to it -- black-hole type darkness here. Smells meaty and vinous at first. Then a bit of roasty char emerges, along with black plums, coconut, vanilla, caramel, Bing cherries, extremely mild citrusy hop notes, and just a promise of black liquorice. An amazing aroma, but the taste is mind-bogglingly complex: Big roasted black malt flavors, with dark cherries, prunes, fresh plums, raisins, all awash in just a hint of bourbon. Some char flavor sneaks in during the middle, along with vanilla notes and whispers of German chocolate cake. Black roasted finish lasts forever, it seems, with sharp vinous blackberry flavors interspersed among the panoply of burnt deliciousness and puckery oaky tannins. Alcohol flavor is noticeable, but melds expertly with bourbon accents. Slick, luxuriously silky mouthfeel. Not too heavy, but substantial all the same. The folks at Deschutes knew exactly how long to age this one before letting it out of the gate. This is something I could easily drink all night, every night if I could. Really, I couldn't ask for anything more in a Russian Imperial Stout. As close to perfection as I can imagine. I was lucky enough to get my order in to Liquid Solutions in time before these all sold out, but I wish I would have ordered more than three. At least it will be available again some time in 2008. You'd better believe I'm stocking up on this one at that time. Excellent, excellent beer. Seek out at all costs. 1,764 charactersorfeu, Mar 04, 2007

Appearance: Pours a perfect absolute black color with a light brown chocolaty brown head. Even in a small glass it had nice sticky lacing. 
Smell: Oh my goodness this is an enticing aroma. A bouquet of delightful chocolate, roasted malts, dark fruits, licorice, molasses, hints of spiced rum and suggestion of smokiness. Let the salivating begin. This is divine.
Taste: The nose is glorious and the taste is even more rich. It is loaded with sweet dark malts, fruits and chocolate flavors. The sweet soft milky chocolaty flavors and the licorice, molasses and toffee, are balance by just the right infusion of coffee espresso hop flavors and a light alcohol feel showing through like fudgy port. MAGNIFICENT!!!
Mouthfeel: This is a rich chewy full-bodied beer. The carbonation is low giving it a silky smoothness that is ideal with its big feel and bigger flavor.
Drinkability: This is definitely a big beer in all respects but I could really enjoy sipping this slowly all night long. This is truly a work of art. A masterpiece from Deschutes Brewery. 
Thanks John for bringing this all the way from Oregon so we could have a chance to try it. 
Hope this is helpful.

T: Yum! The flavors here just love to "smooth" together.Coffee/roasted malts and chocolate are the leaders here surprisingly, with oak hints added. Yum. Some slight licorice, slight toffee, and a tad bit of bourbon notes round out this awesome flavor. Yum. One thing I'm wondering is... Where the hell is that 11%? Trace amounts of alcohol is around there, but nowhere does it even hint at 11%. Hops are there as well, leaving there presence on the tongue. Ends on the dry side. Again, yum!

Pours a thick black color, nice carbonation, nice small creamy tan head which lasted a couple of minutes, some oil slicks, and some nice lacing afterwards. The nose is sweet roasted malts, licorice, slight vanilla, deep chocolate/toffee and a nice touch of caramel. The taste is absolutely delicious of sweet roasted malts, chocolate/toffee, licorice. This puppy goes down very smooth, with a slight dry finish. The alcohol is hidden very well. Medium body, a very nice well balanced brew. Very drinkable, definitely the best brew for me from Deschutes.

A - Dark, dark, dark body with a small coffee head (came to the table 1-fingered) that sinks to a film very similar to the crema on a good espresso. left chunks of lace down the glass.
S - strong, pungent chocolate and roasted malts mix with a sort of cherry-like booziness.
T - velvety bitter chocolate (like baker's cocoa), dark fruits, a sort of oaky-whiskey flavor, and ever-so-slight PNW hoppiness in the finish.
M - so damn smooth! big body with low carbonation and a pervasive creaminess.
D - such a good beer! a bit heavy to pair with a plate of fish n' chips, but both were excelent! 634 charactersisaac, Feb 24, 2007
4.85/5  rDev +8.3%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pour: 22oz bomber to tulip glass. A thick opaque liquid pours out of the bottle, seemingly flat at first like heated molasses, but as it splashes into the glass a thick dark brown head forms over top, swelling and growing to about two fingers thick, looking more like chocolate whipped cream than the head of a beer. Very thick and slow to go away.
Nose: Like a cup of joe, seriously. This could be coffee. Burnt up toast, slightly vinous, something that could singe my nose hairs, thick roast malts that I can't wait to drink.
Mouth: Exactly like it smells, only stronger. Very bitter all the way through, like chewing on chocolate covered espresso beans. Coffee, chocolate, and burnt toast. Charcoal swallow, very dry. A bit viscous in the mouthfeel, something I would let sit for a year or two and see how it develops. Chewy thick body with consistent pestering of tiny little carbonation bubbles.
Seriously one of the best stouts I've ever had. Delicious! 968 charactersclickpush, Feb 21, 2007
5/5  rDev +11.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5On tap first at at the Ash Street Saloon in Portland, proper review from on tap at Old Chicago in Beaverton, Or.
Black, opaque crude oil appearance with a dark chocolate head. Absolutely no light gets through this. Impressive.
Nose reveals a huge burst of baker's chocolate, robust coffee, vanilla and slight smoke. Alcohol comes through a little, but I have no complaints.
H-U-G-E maltiness and Kona coffee notes bulldoze your taste buds, followed by burnt sugar and caramel notes. After intitial tasting more subtle notes become noticable. Bourbon and vanilla (just enough to compliment and not get in the way) are evident, playing off the chocolate and coffee flavors to please anyone with a sweet tooth. Soon after, the brightness of citus hops begins to shine through, lending balance and Zinfandel-like spicyness to the equation. Fruit flavors, notably fig, start to become evident as this warms. Make no mistake, this is a BIG beer. But the way all of the flavors are so delicately interwoven is amazing. 
Believe the hype, this is obscenely good.
Great creamy mouthfeel, with suprisingly active carbonation. This is not as heavy as you would imagine. Drinkabily is amazing....but make sure to sip this one. At 11% ABV and $4 a pint, it may be toooo drinkable.
Get it now....if you still can. This is the must try beer for the year, and the new standard by which all other Impy stouts will be measured against. Simply incredible. 1,454 characters1whiskey, Feb 20, 2007

A: Pitch black, shiny and oily. A full, thick finger high mass of dark beige bubbles form a solid ceiling across the top of the body. 
S: Milk chocolate, coffee highs, oak, vanilla and some recognizable hops.
T: Starts with strong Belgian chocolate and smooth tobacco leaf. Dark, robust chocolate personality begins to blossom, balanced well with a huge amount of bitterness aided by a copious amount of hops. As it warms, the chocolate really explodes and the hop profile develops tooreally fresh, piney hops. Hops are almost minty with licorice aspects to them. Finishes with some vanilla, a lot of spicy chocolate and milky lactose.
M: Full body, nice mouthfeel and good carbonation. 
D: Absolutely delicious imperial stout, but not a lick of bourbon anywhere near it. Not that theres anything wrong with that, just a bit of false advertising. No negative points given because of that of course. Drinkability is superb, Ill kill this 22oz by myself with out having much problem. 1,050 charactersWestsidethreat, Feb 17, 2007
4.11/5  rDev -8.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4A- About a 1/4" mocha head on a black body. Thin lacing that just doesn't cover the whole top.
S- Some really big coffee notes. Light roasted malts also come through. Very faint dry hop aroma in there too. The malts come off a bit dry in the aroma.
T- Really big coffee malt flavor. Some roasted malt comes through also. Leaves a pretty dry taste in the mouth. Also a nice size bitterness but not sure if it is a bitterness from the malts or from hops. Can't really taste any hops in it. Maybe a tad bit of some dry grass hops. Some light oak mixed in it too. Nothing that comes off big at all.
M- Medium to full body (more on full side) with low carbonation and kind of oily.
D- It is good. There is to much coffee malts in this for me. I prefer it with more chocolate and roasted malts. Is pretty tasty though. 816 charactersBlindPig, Feb 17, 2007
4.45/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Appearance: Deep brown, no light gets through at all, foamy coffee ice-cream colored head dissipates into a thin lacing with inviting bubbles.
Smell: Rich coffee, roasted malt sweetness, anise, a hint of bourbon alcohol, hops I can't detect in the smell.
Taste: Complex, a hint of citrus rind upfront, then a big round coffee and roasted malt flavor, an espresso acidity throughout, then a huge dose of aromatic hops in then nose, alcohol is not especially present in the flavor, dry in the finish.
Mouthfeel: Very creamy and full bodied, near perfection for this style, lightly carbonated and easy to drink.
Drinkability: Well at 11% ABV, you must be cautious, but for this style it's very well crafted and drinkable, very complex, flavorful, and actually clean in the finish. Thumbs up. 800 charactersguitarmage, Feb 10, 2007

Roasty, toasty aroma, chocolate and espresso, yes, and more...carob and raisins, dark rum, and molasses...ah! Dark and lovely!
Whoa! Once in the mouth, it's a delivery of rich, thick, deliciousness....whiskey-toned, a bit, mixed with dark chocolate...indulgent, decadent...full, but surprisingly smooth. Velvety...someone should paint a portrait of Elvis on this. Here comes the whiskey kick again...here comes the blackstrap...
I'm only halfway through the bottle, and I'm feeling mighty satisfied. 
Do I wish I'd saved it for friends? Maybe, but I'm too content to worry about them now.

Beer pours black as can be, it has a very nice tan head, that receded, but kept a decent size. Looks like stout should.
Aromas are intense and awesome. I can smell this one from several inches away from my nose. Smells are of dark roasted malts, coffee, and very dark chocolate.
Tastes are very full and rich. There is a touch of anise on the front, coffee, and some dark sugary sweetness. The finish ends nicely with a slight bitter chocolate flavor, some hoppiness, and a bit of an alcohol burn. The bitterness and the alcohol tastes aren't overwhelming, but they both really help balance this out. This is quite complex.
Mouthfeel on this is incredible. It is full bodied, thick, and incredibly well rounded. 
Wow... drinkability? Heck yeah, it's a huge beer, but it's so interesting, and enjoyable, that I could drink this again with no problem.
Deschutes is an excellent brewery. And after tasting this one... easily one of the best when it comes to stouts. 1,122 charactersflexabull, Feb 08, 2007
4/5  rDev -10.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 422 oz Bomber. Tres Fancy. The aroma is rich roasted malt and chocolate with licorice, cocoa and a faintly dusty earhty aroma that could be oak. Decent smelling, but not mind blowing. The body is a stygian black that absorbs light and easily supports a two finger thick head that is both frothy and creamy looking and that doesnt yield ground very redily, staying erect and ready long after my normal 5 minute sniffing routine.
Flavor is somewhat low key with licorice, molasses, coffee, chocolate, fudge and piney hops making a massive play at subtlety, but not offering anything mega-fantastic as far as flavor concetration. It has a creamy chocolatepudding flavor/feel to it that is very enticing and lets you forget shortcomings. There is also a spicy note in the far finish that I assume is the oak. Other than that, and a mild dusty, earthy, woody feel also in the aftertaste, the oak is reserved. Overall Its a hard beer not to like, but it isnt too hard not to love. 982 charactersJredner, Feb 07, 2007

A: Black as the darkest night. A huge three fingered cinnamon brown head ever so slowly breaks down into a fluffy mountain range of bubbles. Lacing looks like squid tenticles crawling all over the glass.
S: Roasted coffee. Bitter cocoa. Dark fruit. Faint smoke and oak barrel. Warm bourbon.
T: Very complex. A deep roasted coffee is followed by dark bitter chocolate. A slight pine hop bite tingles the tongue. Thick malts, black strap molasses and licorice are followed by dark fruit and the ever so slight taste of smoke. Vanilla flavored bourbon barrel in the nose with a warming alcohol sensation.
M: Vicous and thick. Creamy smooth. Minimal carbonation. Dry earthy finish.
D:An incredible elixir. A very complex and deep brew that balances each flavor perfectly. The high ABV limits the amount per serving but the beer is delicious. I can't help but wonder what a year of aging would do for this brew. Highly recommended! 980 charactersTyrawlings, Feb 07, 2007

Worth the effort though - the usual opaque/brown head, with a really great aroma - roasty, slightly vanilla-bourbony, whiffs of coffeelike alcohol and toastiness.
This is such a cool-ass beer - initial roastiness, like heavily roasted coffee and dark, 75% plus cocoa, that opens up into a toffeeish, bourbony maltiness. THIS is how you use a bourbon barrel - no overly-vanilla-ish dominance, but a complimentary flavor to the other maltiness going on. There's a faint hop bitterness, but this beer's not about the hops. The finish just rules - roastiness, with hints of toffee, bourbon, whiffs of alcohol... beautiful. Great mouthfeel - chewy as hell. Could have several, fall down, go boom, be happy.
Many thanks to Duckboy for the bottle!!! :thumbup: :banned: 854 characterssponberg, Feb 05, 2007

The wax seal takes a while to get undone. Kudos for intangible points: anticipation should be a variable in reviews... this one scores a 5.
Nice viscous pour with a thick, oily presence, dark tan head of slight stature. The weight of the beer in rolling it around the chalice presents well. 
A slight bitter chocolate back in the nose, again present in the aftertaste. Very mild coffee undertones with some rum notes. Sweet and inviting. 
Flavors are well balanced. The bitterness presents no hop characeristics, but rather shows its sweet side. I would describe it as cloying but for the speed of its release, as if a good whisky hotness had evaporated the aromas and esters as quickly. 
Great brew and a great nightcap. Who is partying with this all night long? I'll be there with wax on my teeth! 901 charactersunklesyd, Feb 03, 2007
4.55/5  rDev +1.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Mega beer karma out to thebungyo for sending this beer my way. This beer was ever so lightly chilled before serving. The beer was served in a wide mouthed wine goblet.
Appearance: The body of the beer was blacker than black. I may have indeed stumbled into the abyss. The head was a short lived one and a half finger high with a burnt tan coloration. The head was quickly swallowed by the abyss and resolved into a ring of foam. The sides of my glass looked like an oil slick had run down my glass.
Smell: This beer is deeply roasted, toasted and chared espresso and dark semi sweet cocoa. The supporting aromas of anise, molasses, smoke, vanilla and bourbon waft about my glass.
Taste: This is a dam near perfect RIS. The beer is loaded up with roasted, toasted and chared flavors of espresso, dark malts, bakers chocolate, anise, molasses, a nipe of smoke, vanilla and a bourbonesque alcohol spiceyness. In short this beer is kick ass!
Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: This beer is full bodied. The beers flavors are loaded with roasted, toasted and chared flavors. The flavor of the beer is long lasting. I found it very distressing how fast this beer disappeared from my glass. Must have more! 1,201 charactersnlmartin, Jan 31, 2007

A: 4.5 great lacing & head retention
S: 4.0
T: 4.5
MF:4.5
D: 5.0
Main Differences from last year's: Less Alcohol heat, but not enough to bump up my taste score. No discernible smokeyness this year. I also get some vanilla hints this year. Slightly better than last year. Still not cracking my top 5 for this style
06 Version:
Pours purplish/black with 3 fingers+ of rocky mocha colored head. Good lacing & fair head retention when you consider the style 
S: Smokey malt (bacon & ham) up front. Coffee comes through as this warms
T: Smokey malt, chocolate, licorice & a little coffee up front. Coffee, warming alcohol, burned grain & molasses sink in as this works. Finishes dry, with coffee & baker's chocolate, plus a little alcohol burn & more than a hint of smokeyness. 
MF: Rich, chewy & not much carbonation
Drinks okay, but alcohol burn & heft also make this a nightcap or fire side sipper. This one would pair well with some hunks of red meat & or chocolate. This a keeper for deschutes, more next year please! 1,053 charactersrusspowell, Jan 31, 2007

3.67/5  rDev -18.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 3 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3I will preface this by saying that without noticing the print on the label I picked this beer up on a recommendation from my cellarman. As a result I didn't notice the mention of licorice in the beer. Had I known this I would not have bought it as I despise licorice. 
The Abyss poured a deathly black syrup with the darkest head I have seen in quite some time - a rich mahogany brown - which recedes quickly. Sticky sweet aroma of light hop, maple, molasses and roasted woods. Syrupy cannot be emphasized enough. The brew stuck to the side of the glass like molasses and coats your mouth accordingly.
Virtually no carbonation to this one, on first sip I didn't taste much at all and was pleasantly surprised at the mild almost dry flavor to the beer, yet it still had the dark feel and slight bitterness to it. A few more sips and more flavors came out, a woodsy taste and roasted flavor. Some flavor hit me right in the back of the soft palate and into my nose, making it tingle slightly, but it was indescribable. 
Then, like a hammer blow to the face, it was licorice to overtake the finish. With each warming sip the licorice took over and enveloped the taste. The more you thought you were tasting it the stronger it got.
This beer is devastatingly complex with rich tones and more subtlety than a dark British comedy. Almost too much for my admittedly novice palate, however my aversion to licorice is profound and would not allow me to continue to drink this brew. Regardless, this is one of the better brews I have tasted in terms of brewing prowess and depth, so if you like or can handle the licorice flavor I suggest it highly. 1,651 charactersAndbrew, Jan 30, 2007
4.83/5  rDev +7.8%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Bottle from my first Liquid Solutions order, this was well worth the wait and uncertainty, I feel lucky to have scored it this way!
Poured into a snifter, thick and black as night with a beautiful beige brown head that remains just long enough, leaving a sturdy beige ring and lacing around the glass. Smell is mocha, molasses and a hit of licorice.
Taste is just about perfect. I love bourbon barrel aged beers, even when they beat you over the head with the bourbon. But when they are balanced and only hint at the bourbon like this, I can't imagine they can get any better. The only other barrel aged beer I've had that does this so well is the Goose Island Imperial Brown. This seems to have every flavor that an imperial stout should, and they all take turns with my taste buds.
Mouthfeel is full bodied, sweet but not syrupy, and the alcohol is well hidden, very little burn.
I could drink this all night, or at least til it put me out. 954 charactersunclejedi, Jan 27, 2007
4.17/5  rDev -6.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Midnight with a creamy and thick dark chocolate mocha head. Good retention and sticky lacing make there way down the glass.
Let me start by saying that I absolutely love BA beers. There is a problem with many of them in the fact that the brewers over due the bourbon or oak aging and it overpowers the flavors of the beer itself. Just like wine it is meant to accent and add different characteristics than take the lead in flavor. (Okay off my rant). One smell of this brew and you can tell it is nearly a perfect length of barrel aging. Roasty chocolate aomas, with vanilla and black currant esters. Mollasses as well as the slightest bit of prune, are accented by the subtle oak aromas that seem to be nice and toasty.
This beer is big with anise in the mouth. Very roasty and a long finish that is very tannic and chewy. Dark chocolate very bitter, with vanilla bean, and mollasses. Smokey, toasty oak with very little sign of bourbon. Nicely balanced and largely complex. I think I would have rated a little higher if it weren't bone dry. 
Mouth is dry, thick and chewy. Nice burn in the chest. 1,107 charactersmcallister, Jan 21, 2007

4.65/5  rDev +3.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured this 22 oz. bottle, with it's rust-colored label and black wax seal, to a snifter. Took it from my cellar, then chilled in the fridge for about a half hour, so I'd estimate about 55F was the temperature at serving. Polished off the bottle over the course of 1 1/2 - 2 hours, so it was given plenty of time to warm and develop.
A: Pours like oil, a deep charcoal brown, almost impenetrable; amber and ruby at the fringes. Initially there's a creamy tan head, about the color of crushed black pepper. After the head subsides, flecks of lace are scattered above a thin film. When swirled, the color changes from brown to a rich, ruddy maroon and that creamy mocha head returns for an encore.
S: Lots of chocolate, coffee and smoky oak intermingled with the sweetness of molasses, syrup, raisins, cherries and vanilla. Each time the glass is agitated, those delicious smells come wafting up from the glass. Mmmmm....
T: The darkest and finest of bitter chocolate melded with a spicy roasted coffee. Oak barrel flavor with hints of vanilla permeates, warm and slightly boozy. There's also a sugary syrup melded with a tangy, smoky, almost leathery essence, like a slowly smoked brisket. 
M: Thick, full mouthfeel. Huge body with a lingering bittersweet aftertaste - lasting 15+ minutes after the last sip. 11% alcohol is well concealed and balance is superb. Smooth from start to finish.
D: The ultimate sipper and a wonderfully crafted beer. Rich deep character & fine balance - definitely in the top echelon I've beers I've enjoyed. I recently had a pint on-tap at Concordia Ale House and found the tastes to be similar, though the chocolate/coffee character seemed more prevalent in the kegged version, while the tannic oak barrel/vanilla qualities were more forward in the bottled version. Either way, this beer comes very highly recommended - thanks to Deschutes for brewing this fine stout! 1,913 charactersmsubulldog25, Jan 15, 2007
4.75/5  rDev +6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4This stuff is amazing. I've always liked Deschutes products and I think they're very quickly getting better. Recent discoveries are the Hop Trip and Cinder Cone Red, both exceptional. The Red gives Rogue's Red a run for its money and may even be better. There are obviously a lot of people who care a lot about beer at Deschutes.
22 oz. bottle, wax sealed... great simple design on the label. Warmed up a bit while I was getting all the wax off... definitely improves as it warms and flavors open up.
Poured into a pint glass with a nice dark head which laaasts, and is actually pleasant to drink on its own. Very creamy, leaves significant lacing.
Flavors seem to change a little as you drink it. Initially I noticed a ton of chocolate with a bit of coffee and a very nice hop bitterness, grassy in character. As it warmed up and after the first glass, the licorice started to come out a bit more. The oak/bourbon barrel aging is noticeable as well which surprises me a little considering how much is going on here. Great balance.
Awesome drinkability if a tad thinner than I'd expect, especially considering the alcohol. I could easily get into a ton of trouble with this one if someone else was doing the pouring...
I'll be buying several bottles of this next time I go beer shopping, I do believe. Bravo to Deschutes. 1,336 charactersjohnbonham1980, Jan 14, 2007

Nifty wax sealed cap, indicates a candidate for some serious aging which I think this beer deserves.
Nose of cocoa, alcohol, roasted malt, slightly pungent.
Pours nearly black, subdued head, chocolate mlk colored head.
And finally the taste--chocolate, coffee, vanilla, yet dry with a slight bite of the oak. The thousand ways an imperial stout can err avoided. Astounding mouthfeel, the alcohol subdued in the mouth but warms the belly.
Astonishing. The sum is greater than the parts and this beer must be experienced. Bravo to Deschutes.
By the bottom of the bottle I am perfect.

4.88/5  rDev +8.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I dreaded drinking this beer. I had been to multiple stores just to find it, and I had a feeling there was no way it would live up to my expectations. I also had a fear that if it was great, I wouldn't be able to find another bottle. To make matters worse, my wife and I had friends visiting from the East coast, and the idea came to us that it would be great to try this beer that was so hard to find. I could just see the four of us sitting around sipping snifters of "the pride of the NW" that tasted like skunky motor oil.
I popped the cap - actually, I broke the cap. That wax probably helps with long term storage, but it doesn't make opening any easier. I poured four samples (not equal samples, but samples nonetheless) and passed them around. 
I took a sniff, and my first fears of a skunkfest were laid to rest. I took a sip and was amazed at not only the depth of flavor, but the mouthfeel. It was silky smooth. I knew that it was aged in bourbon barrels and was 11% ABV, so I expected a much harsher experience. This beer was absolutely delicious. Even my wife who is much more of an IPA drinker finished her sample. 
I'm horrible at describing flavors, so I won't even try. I will say this - sometimes stouts have a harsh burnt/roasted flavor, this beer doesn't have that. It has a balance of sweetness, bitterness and "roastiness" that makes you want to lick your glass when you're done.
My quest now continues for another bottle. 1,456 charactersSvejk, Jan 06, 2007
4.76/5  rDev +6.2%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5It's funny how little you hear of this beer. Usually with stouts this good the talk on this site is overwhelming. Not in this case. It's amusing because this is one of the few barrel aged beers that does it right in my opinion. 
Body is like mud diluted with chocolate milk. Even the edges of the liquid are as black as a starless midnight. Head rises to a nice 1/2 inch of dark brown foam. It really looks fantastic. Lacing charts progress all the way down. 
Nose is HUMONGOUS coffee with a spine of chocolate. There's the barest hint of vanilla in the nose but not so much as to give away the bourbon barrel aging to the unaware. 
That same detraction is a plus as far as taste goes. Any bourbon barrel stout I've ever had has had far too much bourbon up front which obscures the stout flavors. Not here. The stout flavors rightfully take center stage whilst the bourbon flavors play the role of backup singers. And these singers are in perfect harmony. Up front is chocolate, coffee, molasses, and in the rear is a splash of bourbon, tying the flavors together like The Dude's rug did his living room. No one has ever done it this perfect before where barrel aging is concerned.
Mouth is rightfully creamy and full. I could drink a ton of this and would do so before ANY other barrel aged stout. No other barrel aged stout comes close. I'm sure a year from now once people catch on I'll get many requests for it. That seems to be the case with most Northwest brews! 1,480 charactersTheBungyo, Jan 06, 2007
4.65/5  rDev +3.8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I served this beer at just below room-temp on the suggestion of the guy who sold it to me. It comes in a bomber with a brown label and a black-wax-dipped cap. 
The second I popped the top of I could smell roasted, chocolaty, malty, hoppyness. Strong chocolaty character and good hop aroma. Strong head. After the pour it looked like there was a butterscotch milkshake sitting on top of a snifter of coffee. Head dissipates slowly.
The taste is very much of roasted malts and hop flavor. I think the hop bitterness combined with the molasses flavors is what is giving the impression of unsweetened chocolate. There is a slight spiciness and a some vanilla in the background. Each sip seems to be a journey of flavors.
The alcohol is very much in the background of flavors. The beer warms the belly less than I would expect for 11%. This is another fine offering from one of my favorite breweries. I find myself sipping in moderation to stretch the duration of the flavor experience. 990 charactersleedorham, Jan 06, 2007
4.55/5  rDev +1.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5A highly anticipated release from an excellent Oregon brewery. My shop went through 30 cases in less than a week, if that's any measure. Presented in a 22oz bottle with a black wax seal.
 Pours as dark as a black steer's tuckus on a moonless prairie night. Inky black body is topped by a good finger of deep, dark brown head. A very pretty beer. Aroma is heavy on the roasted malt, with complex notes of coffee, licorice, dark chocolate, and a good whiff of alcohol. Palate is ridiculously rich. A ton of roasted dark and chocolate malt is tempered by a flash of an almost milk chocolate sweetness up front. The full bitter roasty character emerges mid-palate, along with the presence of some fairly sharp bittering hops. Finish is more roasted malt with a bit of licorice. The mouthfeel is simply perfect - rich, creamy, and luxurious, like a less-sweet version of a Dove chocolate bar. For such a strong beer, the alcohol is hidden extremely well. Damn, I'm a fan of this beer. I guess I need to grab a few more bottles before it disappears for good. 1,053 charactersElGordo, Jan 03, 2007
4.63/5  rDev +3.3%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Appearance is beautiful -- agressive pour in a tall glass yields an espresso crema-colored head that expands fairly quickly to the top of the glass, then settles into a slow descent, ending up hovering about an 1/8th inch above the Abyss. 
Smells of coffee and chocolate, as well as some hops -- everything you would expect from a strong stout.
Taste is intensely bitter and intensely sweet. To carelessly combine those two tastes into one compound word can only result in understatement. There's also some very subtle oakiness; maybe I'm just imagining it because I read the label, though.
Mouthfeel combines with the taste to fool you into thinking you are drinking the darkest-chocolate milkshake in existence. Very smooth, but not without carbonation, which is a good thing.
This beer is so rich, I don't think i can finish another one, but I'm going to try. I should probably try another Bell's Expedition Stout before saying this, but what the hell -- this is the best imperial stout I've ever had. 1,008 charactersinflatablechair, Dec 31, 2006
4.65/5  rDev +3.8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I am incredibly impressed by this lovely brew. 22oz wax topped bottle. Pours with a fluffy tan head that falls back into the black goodness below. Smells throw out the typical stout roasts and coffee as well as the obvious bourbon nose. For an imperial stout that's been hanging in barrels this one is easy to drink. 
I can't help but wonder how this will taste in 6+ months. This is one for aging and enjoying in sips. 420 charactersDubbercody, Dec 24, 2006
4.53/5  rDev +1.1%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Been checking my local store for last couple weeks and finally hit the right day for this beauty. As I popped the cap the first thing that hit me was roasted coffee, hadnt even started to pour and was just blasted by this great smell. Pour was jet black with a nice 1 inch satiny beige head. Damn it was dark, no light was passing through. Taste was coffee, toasted barley, hints of bourbon and vanilla, with a nice hop bitterness finish. Mouthfeel was thick as a milkshake, just coated my mouth and would linger till the next sip be it 5 seconds or 5 minutes later. Drinkability, this is one of the best stouts I have ever had. Its so rich and tasty that its a must try for any stout lover that can get their hands on some. 724 charactersIguana, Dec 24, 2006
4.43/5  rDev -1.1%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 422 oz. serving, $4.99 retail... from the wax-covered bottle: "the abyss: stout brewed with licorice and molasses with 33% aged in oak and oak bourbon barrels."
this thing poured out thickly like motor oil: opaque black and with a big, frothy, chocolately head. carbonation ascends from the murky depths...
the bouquet is on the sweet side with notes of vanilla, oak, molasses, dark chocolate, espresso, and of course bourbon.
early prognosis is this is something special.
this is one rich, tasty ale. espresso, toffee, bitter chocolate, burnt toast and of course bourbon fight for supremecy here i an amalgam of flavors with none really winning outright. the hop profile is green and noticeable throughout and could probably use some time to mellow out.
as far as drinkability, well it is 11% abv so that says it all.
i think this is a really good beer with the probability that it'll get even better with some age. i'm going in for a few more and i'll set them down for awhile. 994 charactersunclederby, Dec 24, 2006
