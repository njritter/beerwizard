A: An absolute beauty, this thick and heavily opaque beer is a flaming gold with orange highlights. There's some sediment in this unfiltered looker. The head is a dense, heavy crown two fingers in height that holds up well and leaves similarly dense webbing fall the way down the walls of the glass.
S: Cracking this can open causes and explosion of incredible hop aroma. Some much tropical fruit and citrus, balancing pithy and sweet, mingles with herbacious and floral bitterness and, as if it needs more complexity, the malts add candy-like sweetness that balances as it should.
T: This is one of the most delicious beers a hophead could ever throw down his or her gullet. Citrus and tropical fruits come out almost simultaneously, the citrus perhaps a touch ahead. Neither note is one dimensional, though; notes are both sweet and tart citrus, flesh and rind and juice, lemon and lime and orange. Tropical notes of pineapple, mango, apricot are all presented in kind. The malt balance is such that sweetness is very present but does not diminish the power of the hops. To add to it all, this thing is all kinds of dank from the middle into a massively lingering finish.
M: This thing moves on the palate, dry without going chalky, hoppy as can be without going astringent, fairly thick in body but plenty crisp to cut through it. The finish, as the beer goes from semi-dry to somewhat dryer, is resinous and dank. 1,493 charactersBrenden, Jun 20, 2017

Finger or two of ivory head trail some lace behind and slim into a foam cap. Aromas and flavors decidedly dankly tropical - like pine resin shellac on mango, papaya, and the like... Medium-bodied with some chew... Bitterness is fairly moderate but lingers well past the sip, overcoming the sugars and coating the tongue. Not sure of the hops or can date, but I liked this plenty, though I'd not put it on par with Heady or Banger, even understanding it was a different animal entirely. 557 charactersGreywulfken, Jun 20, 2017

4.19/5  rDev -6.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4This was poured into a snifter. The appearance was a burnt hazy orange color with a slim finger’s worth of white foamy head, barely any lacing and kinda messy for what is there. The aroma starts off with sweet papaya with some mango warming up with some sweet to bitter danky onion. The flavor starts danky bittersweet. Onion, papaya and mango flow together to combine that danky to tropical fruit bittersweetness. Aftertaste is the same with a quick wet bittersweet finish. On the palate, this one sat about a medium on the body with a nice sipping to sessionable quality about it. Carbonation runs light, feels good. Light throaty hop burn without alcohol burn. Overall, really great beer, it’s really worth the hype. Maybe not Heady or Focal level, but this is up there. 777 charactersLone_Freighter, Jun 16, 2017

A: Medium golden orange with some tangerine - hazy with the signature Alchemist suspended sediment chunks - pours with a small white head, fades to a wispy cap, leave some nice streaks of lacing
S: Intensely hoppy, even for The Alchemist - rich citrus, orange, ruby red grapefruit, grapefruit - citrus flesh, zest, rind, and pith - candied citrus - extremely dank, straight-up weed - resinous weed and bright, sticky pine - juicy tropical notes - pale malts and caramel at the base
T: Hop juice - huge citrus, with orange and grapefruit - citrus flesh, oily rind, zest, and grapefruit pith - dank and resinous, weed, sticky pine - very bitter with lingering bitterness - lightly earthy with some hoppy spice, touch of pepper - some tropical notes but they are mostly overshadowed by the citrus and weed - some onion and garlic - light bread and caramel malts, some sweetness, some booze
M: On the full side of medium, oily, smooth, finish could be much cleaner
O: In Soviet Russia, beer crushes you
The Crusher is uniquely and absurdly hoppy. It lacks the bright charm of Focal Banger and the drinkability, balance, and overall magic of Heady. But it's memorable. And it's an experience. 1,210 charactersangrybabboon, May 11, 2017

L:  Cloudy medium golden pour with 1.5 fingers of foamy white head.  Great lacing.  Sediment at the bottom of the glass...  recently canned.
S:  Bitter and hoppy... strong citrus notes of grapefruit mingled with pepper and pine.
T/F:  Malt sweetness is there... just for a heartbeat before the well-named crushing hop bitterness kicks in to wreck the palate.  Lots of grapefruity citrus... resinous pine and a bit of spice.  Well carbonated.. almost astringent and drying.  Alcohol is there but well hidden.  Finish is almost dry and leaves you wanting to take that next sip right away.
O:  Not surprisingly an awesome big DIPA from the Alchemist.  Somewhat similar flavor to Heady Topper but harsher/more bitter.  Really fantastic, and one I can't wait to try again. 823 charactersEMV, Apr 25, 2017

Smell: You can smell the hops from the other room. Pine cones, resin, grass, and citrus.
Taste: Dank, piney, and citrus with some bitterness.
Mouthfeel: Big beer but pleasant, sticky.
Overall: Great dipa, more bitter and assertive than heady and focal, but that's fine with me. 358 charactersPhineasco, Apr 15, 2017

Smell was citrus with the pine resin I was expecting. Taste was citrus - orange and grapefruit followed by a nice subtle pine. The malts held the beer in tact so it was not a real palate crusher. This was a great beer to celebrate my weekend festivities. Luckily I think he will grab me some more for an upcoming visit. 408 charactersVTR, Apr 08, 2017

4.33/5  rDev -3.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.25A: Pours a hazy gold with visible sediment chunks, slightly frothy, but visibly viscous.  Sticky lacing
S: Aromas of grapefruit pith, pine, sweet malt
T: Sticky sweet grapefruit, barleywine hints of caramelized sugars, sweet Pine, whatever that is.  Perhaps a special type of pine, Vermont sticky pine dankness. Sweet pine resin and fruits mixing with the grapefruit and orange rinds.  Some pineapple and sticky malt abound in this one.  At the end, there is some dry slightly tannic bitterness, some earthy residue left over from such a huge dryhopping and boil. 
M: thick viscous low to medium carbonation.  
O: Overall this is a sticky sweet mix of pine , grapefruit pulp and tangerine bitter pulp with a somewhat sweet hint of what I tasted when I first had 120 minute IPA from Dogfish Head.  This of course is more bitter , less sweet and more focused on the hops than even that sweet syrup is.  This perhaps less syrupy and more full of flavor.  It left my mouth with an aftertaste when I had only had a few sips that were hard to get off my tongue.   Perhaps a palate wrecker / crusher indeed. 1,104 charactersalpinebryant, Mar 28, 2017

Great retention and lacing in the glass. The floaties danced on the rising bubbles, reminding me of a hoppy and happy snow globe. Bright aromas of grapefruit, blueberry, pine, and resin. Bracingly bitter on the first sip. Huge earthy, dank flavors mixed with grapefruit pith and pine. A clean and slick dry finish. Not at all boozy; just an amazing beer. 452 charactersBuck89, Mar 28, 2017

The aroma is intense as it reminds me of a light, floral, citric bouquet.  The hops have a biting acidic pulpiness to them yet beer is real smooth while maintaining a thickness not accustomed to DIPAs and then boom!-sweetness on the backend (like a mild grapefruit).  Great balance, slow sipper, great beer and man is that ABV hidden. 420 charactersclayrock81, Mar 18, 2017

Pours a lightly hazy pale yellow gold in color with a finger of white head. Aroma is resiny pine and grapefruit, from the can the focus is on squarely on the pine notes. Taste starts with some pine and grapefruit then adds pineapple and stone fruit notes with a solid bitterness in the finish. Medium body with moderate carbonation and a bit of slickness from the hops. Overall this is a tasty brew, it hits all the right notes for a DIPA. 579 charactersmnj21655, Mar 08, 2017

A dry crisp bitterness rides the entire length of the palate and then lingers. It's quite aggressive but as it warms the bitterness fades a little and becomes drier which is a much better balance with the stone fruit sweetness and slightly sticky caramel. 328 charactersNarkee, Feb 23, 2017

Has nice tropical fruity smell with a nice hoppy aroma as well. Has a very juicy yet hoppy taste with great balance of the 2. I has a nice crisp clean finish making this hands down the best DIPA I've ever had. Better then Heady and Focal in my opinion. This is definitely worth the trip to Vermont all day. 491 charactersErikshegda1994, Feb 20, 2017

Some fair chunks of sediment here settling to the bottom. Leathery hops, hemp oil, pineapple, mango, the faintest whiff of alcohol. Bomb of bitter hops off the bat makes this a bit of a palate wrecker, though I get some resinous oils, burnt citrus peels and the like in there.

4.76/5  rDev +6%look: 4.25 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Picked up a 4-pack from the Alchemist while in Vermont a few weeks back. Stored cold since then. Pours a cloudy/hazy yellow with white head that eventually fades to a thin lacing. Smells dank, resinous with lots of pine & citrus hop aromas. Like most Alchemist beers I've tried, it's like opening up a bag of fresh hops. Just great if hops are your thing. Tastes is more bitter than other Alchemist beers but won't take the enamel of your teeth. All the hop aromas are packed into the flavor. At 9% ABV it's surprisingly light to medium but very refreshing. Aftertaste is pure hop resin. There is some very faint light malt character but is obviously in the background. No warming or solvent notes but the alcohol does eventually kick in. I feel like this beer is like Heady Topper on steroids. My only complaint is that this beer is not as approachable or one you can have two or three of without getting wrecked for the night (or day, if that's your thing). Completely in your face. Like the can states, "if you want some more?"  Well, they definitely put in more hops. Cheers! 1,079 charactersjwhancher, Feb 16, 2017

4.63/5  rDev +3.1%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Poured slowly straight into a 12oz snifter, a hazy, opaque fiery orange liquid turns to white foam at the top. Head formation peaked at three fingers, with just below exceptional retention. Lacing is prevalent after each sip. Aroma is decidedly light bodied, but hoppy. Orange peel, lemon zest, and grapefruit give a citrusy, fruit quality to it. Faint biscuit malt notes add a little strength to the aroma. Flavor profile opens up slowly, with notes of orange and lemon zest right on the front. As the flavor profile crescendos, and hits its stride, notes of grapefruit, and papaya add to the citrusy flavor. Biscuit malts mingle at the back, providing a little extra oomph to the otherwise hoppy flavor profile. Despite all the hops, flavor profile is balanced and - pardon the pun - crushable. Mouth feel is smooth, with a medium-thick thickness. It slips down smooth and clean. Overall, a delightfully quaffable hoppy beer. With the ABV sitting at 9%, and the overall balance of this beer, this may be one of the more dangerous beers out there. 
Served in a 12oz snifter. 1,076 charactersHarrison8, Feb 12, 2017

Was lucky enough to get 10 pretty sweet beers sent to me by a college buddy. Was really looking forward to this one, having head Heady Topper a few times and Focal Banger the other night. Expecting to be in the 4.40-to-4.55 range. 
Poured a light-to-medium yellow hazy color with 2-to-3 fingers of rocky white head. Lots of bubble streams coming up along the sides of the glass. Excellent foamy lacing. Almost perfect foamy retention. (Sight - 4.50)
Smelled Citra, Cascade, juicy grapefruit, mango, pineapple, peach, tangerine, floral, herbal mints, hints of menthol and sugary candy. (Smell - 4.25)
Tasted a little better version of the smell. Very sugary like I expected. Got Citra, Cascade, juicy grapefruit, mango, pineapple, tangerine, herbal grass, leafy hops, floral, unknown spices, mint, booze, passion fruit, sharp pine, lemon zest and lime. (Taste - 4.25)
Medium body. Sticky texture. Lively carbonation. Sugary, bitter finish. (Feel - 4.25)
This was very good, just two sweet for me overall. Reminded me slightly of a Todd the Axe Man, but not nearly as good. (Overall - 4.25)

A: The body is glowy orange-y to yellow with a very minimal head showing a very weak retention and no lacing at all. And unfortunately, lots of this beer deposit appeared in this body which, for its looks, is quite terrible.
S: The aroma is a lot more hoppy than Heady Topper, having a less fruity and more earthy and resinous profile than its cousin.  It's still quite good.
T: The taste has tons of fruitiness, having lots of citrus, specially orange and tangerine, lemon zest, resin and earthy feeling. Quite good actually.
M: While the mouthfeel isn't quite as good as heady, it still has a very velvety touch with an almost perfect carbonation. Bitterness is happily higher than Heady. :)
O: For hop heads, Crusher is a better option than Heady Topper but it still is a very good beer, totally world-class. Would like to have it again in the future. 880 charactersjoaopmgoncalves, Jan 27, 2017

Smells very juicy with a good amount of citrus hitting first, including lemon zest, grapefruit, tangerine, orange peel, pineapple, sweet grains, malt, sharp piney hops and more citrus fruit. Nice, but not nearly as potent as I hoped for in the nose. Extra "Overall" points for being relatively easy to drink for a 9.6% ABV DIPA.
Tastes basically like it smells with a lot of juicy citrus hops hitting first, then comes the grapefruit, tangerine, lemon orange peel, pineapple, guava, lightly toasted grains, sweet malt, piney hops, bitter sour grapes and more citrus fruit. The balance is fine and it has a good amount of biscuit that compliments the hops well. More bitter and not as good as Heady Topper, in my humble opinion. 938 charactersCHickman, Jan 23, 2017

Smell: A nose of pine and orange.
Taste: Similar theme as the smell with a pine start to with ending on a tropical fruity note.  The taste is a wider one then the smell though, I detected more fruits then just orange as read above.
Feeling: The first mouthful of this drink and I noticed the relatively high alcohol percent.  Then with just a few sips and the feeling left me with a happy note. 520 charactersh0wdy, Jan 04, 2017

Nose is very dank and herbal with a faint tropical fruit background. The flavor is resinous and bitter upfront with some fruit sweetness breaking through slightly. The feel is smooth and thicker than most DIPA's. This beer is amazing and lives up to the hype! A bitter hop bomb with great fruit flavors to balance it out. 429 charactersMeyers1023, Jan 03, 2017

It is quite sweet and the hop profile is too mixed for me to make out strong identifiable notes. Its a good beer, but I expect more from Alchemist. This is definitely my least favorite of all their offerings (I've loved everything else I've had from them). To each their own, but if I wanted this experience, I'd save my money and effort and just pick up a 4-pack of 90 minute. 449 charactersGabrielEVH, Dec 28, 2016

Smell is guava, apricot, papaya, piney, dank marijuana, and grapefruit.
Taste follows dank powerful hops, pine, grapefruit with some tropical guava, papaya, apricot, and tangerine. 
Mouthfeel is pretty darn big, almost sticky from all the fresh hops, light carbonation, a tad dry, and excellent drinkability.

A big thanks to Mark for throwing me one of these the other day!Crusher glugs into the glass, filling it with a glowing orange libation. A good amount of haze runs throughout but it's not in the form of suspended sediment, thankfully. The foam is pure white and velvety smooth. The head reaches two fingers without a problem and although it falls to a crown fairly quickly it does leave behind some nice peak and valley lacing.
Crusher is full on hopped. It's big on the herbal qualities. Sticky weed and various dried herbs come to mind off the bat. The fruitiness is soft but tropical in nature; underripe pineapple and mango. Fresh cut grass, pine, and Bazooka Joe bubblegum wrap up the hop profile. Every now and then I get a whisper of crushed aspirin. The malt backbone manages to have some substance.  Sugar cookie and soda bread make up a nice base.
The flavor follows the nose pretty closely. It's resinous and sticky off the bat. Weed and  those dried herbal notes kick it off and actually push through the finish. Mid palate there is some of that underripe tropical fruitiness that came forward in the nose. That aspirin bitterness pops on the finish, I like it. The malt profile tries t keep pace with sugar cookie and soda bread sweetness. A little boozy peppery heat wraps it up on the backend.
The body is a touch over moderate in weight but has a rather unusual, in a good way, velvety quality that I thoroughly enjoy. Carbonation is moderate, keeps things moving. It's a little sticky upfront but it quickly dries out on the finish. Bitterness is moderate. It's pretty easy drinking considering the abv but there is a touch of heat on the swallow.
Crusher is good beer. An interesting nose is bolstered by a good depth in the flavor department. The malt backbone brings some components not usually come across. There's a touch of booze on the finish but that's a minr gripe and expected from such a big beer. I'd love some more of this. Thanks again, Mark! 1,987 charactersjoe1510, Dec 23, 2016

Juicy with medium-high bitterness. Really solid beer, though it's my third favorite of the Alchemist trio. 350 charactersHuhzubendah, Dec 10, 2016

From a can that was not dated but less than a week old.
Great balance of tropical and pine/citrus. Very hop forward which I enjoyed.
Great look to it, quite hazy and medium yellow in color. Nice head retention and lacing. 254 charactersDopen993, Dec 08, 2016
4.92/5  rDev +9.6%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5Quick review of Crusher. 
This beer sticks true to alchemist style.
Appearance is hazy orange. The odd thing with this beer is that there are actual hop particles floating around in it. First time for everything I guess.
Smell is typical Alchemist/NE IPA. Dank, Tropical Fruit, Juicy and very nice. There is a reason New England is taking the IPA scene by storm.
Taste again is true to Alchemist fashion. Danky, Danky, Danky, some pine and tropical fruit. Hop bite on this one is pretty intense in comparison to Heady and Focal..
Feel is light medium body, not to chewy but not to watery. A really enjoyable mouthfeel.
Overall, another great beer from an outstanding brewery!!!!! 685 charactersMerryTapster, Dec 08, 2016

4.57/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5FROM THE CAN
4N: Dank, almost skunky hops. Resin and earth.
4.25T: That's an extremely hoppy IPA.
4.75M: Thick, promising, and fulfilling.
4.25O: A beer to take places that will take you places.
FROM THE TEKU GLASS
4A: Heavy lacing and decent head atop a hazy auburn beer.
4.5S: Almost fruity, with pineapple, pot, and a hint of booze. Excellent.
4.75T: The first thing I taste are hops. The taste goes on and on, softening from hop leafs into fruit. Bitter fruit, but to my lupulin-trained palette, more balanced than not. The sweet maltiness balances it out perfectly, and complements the stonefruit from the hops. Points for sheer flavor. You're definitely getting your money's worth from this one!
4.5M: Thick, creamy, bitter-tingly, but not quite drying. The faintest bit sticky.
4.5O: Tremendously up my alley, like many over-the-top DIPAs. I love the tropical fruit, the bitterness, the length of flavor, the sheer volume of flavor. I can't imagine drinking anything after this in a session. But you don't want to put anything too crazy before it either. Highly recommended. 1,082 charactersAgentMunky, Dec 06, 2016

Decent hop notes on the aroma, but nothing compared to the other beers. Flavor is very deep hop character, but again, lacking in robust dry hop. Pretty bitter.

Sweet citrus fruits, pine, and a slight amount of alcohol. Taste is a hop explosion. Ripe citrus fruits with lots of grassiness. I do taste a little alcohol, but at 9%, it's hidden enough to make this extremely dangerous. It's quite bitter, but not to the point of off putting. Mouthfeel is slightly above medium. Another great hoppy beer from the Alchemist. I still prefer Focal and Heady, but Crusher is certainly in that range. 501 charactersdaudelin2000, Nov 28, 2016

For me, those are the high points.  Taste follows, but is a bit harsh, and the alcohol certainly isn't masked.  
Been drinking a lot of Focal Banger over the past few weeks, with intermittent sampling of Crusher.  Love the former.   I mention this because, without the contrast, my rating would probably be higher. 425 charactersprofessorchow, Nov 26, 2016

I need to start with the smell due to the fact that my olfactory was aroused upon the popping of the tab. Yes, before I even saw the golden, new penny in sunlight hue, I was drawn in. A melange of citrus and resinous hops with subtle bready notes swept me off my feet. The taste followed much the same path. But the malt really kept it all together. The hops are bold but really stay together. A glorious beer. 
Mouthfeel is slightly full, carbonation stays for the whole ride, and damn. It's a true beauty.
Overall, I think I'm in love. 577 characters2beerdogs, Nov 07, 2016

Smells of peppery hops and citrus.  Taste is hoppy and biting, very hop forward and crisp.  Lingering bitterness and dryness.  Citrus not quite as present in the flavor.  Somehow the booze is well hidden.  Likely masked by the bitterness.  Overall, not a bad showing from The Alchemist.  Personally prefer Heady and Focal. 444 charactersanteatr23, Nov 04, 2016

The Crusher has a similar hop profile to the other two, but is slightly more opaque and has a marginally better mouthfeel. Delicious beer (as you'd expect), and with a little less bitterness MIGHT be my favorite of the 3. Either way, I'm glad Kimmich sticks to his guns and brews these the way he wants, because while a lot of other breweries are cranking out similarly-flavored beers, The Alchemist manages to cram more flavor into each sip than most of them. Fantastic beer. 541 charactersSeanBond, Nov 02, 2016

Dank hops give way to a resin that is more extreme than that I've tasted in any beer before.  The palate is hops slathered with pine sap.  It's an unbelievable IPA that doesn't rely on any gimmicks for its rave reviews.  This is pure, unadulturated IPA - well crafted, and singular.  An excellent, dry finish (almost like a crisp, dry, white wine).  Mouthfeel is on the thicker side for the style (medium thick), with mild carbonation.  This is an exceptional IPA that stands among the best of the best - near the apex of modern IPA tradition. 639 charactersLAp, Oct 28, 2016

T: More pine in the taste as well, over a big, sweet malty body. Finishes, however, with a boatload of hops, primarily earthy, piney and citrusy - both grapefruit and orange/orange peel.

4.33/5  rDev -3.6%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A- Tallboy poured into a goblet with a slightly milky hazed pale golden body and a thick, creamy white cap. That head makes it up past a finger high with very good retention before dying out to a foamy, wide belt at the edges. Lacing begins fast with large sheets giving way to spotty patches.
S- A big blast of hop aromas displaying a somewhat simple yet effective hop pungency. Dank minty herbs, juicy tropical fruits like mango and pineapple, proper pine resin, grapefruit and floral notes are intense. Sticky and fruity. For the ABV it is impressively devoid of any sweet undertones with just a hint of pale bready grains.
T- Much like the aromas with similar elements but the biggest difference is the massive, sharp bitterness crushing the palate like grapefruit zest and bitter resins. This bitterness only works to add complexity and a welcome element to the hop nectars. Notes of mango, pine, mint, intense ruby red grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, sticky weed nugs, grass, oranges and some booze. A touch of sweetness as crackery, bready pale grains form a base.
MF- Texture takes on a both a foamy and very creamy, chewy feeling on the palate. Carbonation is very high and acts to highlight the sharp citrus rind bitterness which coats the palate endlessly.
It took some time for this beer to grow on me but I now consider it another great hop bomb from the brewers that changed the tallboy game forever. 9% and it shows but to a level that is acceptable with deep hop flavors, sharp bitterness and a bit of booze crushing the taste buds. Drink this one late in the game if you have a few lined up. 1,614 characterscbutova, Oct 25, 2016

4.39/5  rDev -2.2%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4.25The Alchemist Crusher
A: This hop-heavy behemoth pours like exactly what it is: one of the progenitors of the oh-so-popular NE IPAs. It is not as murky and opaque as Tree House, but is is certainly not clear in any sense of the word, and there is a heavy presence of large particles, likely both hop and yeast. The head is massive and cream-colored, and retention is nice. Lacing is heavy, thick, and impressive. Carbonation is very active. This is a gorgeous beer, but some might not like the very prominent particulate. 4.75/5
A: Orange, clementine, mandarin, and lots and lots of grapefruit are there in spades working hand-in-hand with ample pine resin, some onion, and "green" dankness. There is an underlying juicy, honeyed sweetness as a result of the malt. Alcohol is surprisingly undetectable on the nose. The aromas are incredibly pungent and intense, and the greenery is nice in this age of fruit juice IPAs. 4.5/5
T: Initially, juicy, sweet citrus fruit with orange, mango, and clementine come on strong, but those fade imperceptibly into pithy, bitter grapefruit. Then the old-school hops come into play. Those weedy, piney, onion notes are here even stronger, with resinous earthy bitterness and an onion/shallot, almost garlic flavor lingering behind in a very weedy way. Honey sweetness carries through the middle of each sip, but it is quickly removed by that old-school approach in favor of intense dryness and earthiness. That bitterness is almost too much over the course of the beer, especially combined with the still imperceptible alcohol. 4.5/5
M: This is unfortunately the weakest part of Crusher (though it certainly lives up to its name here and elsewhere). The lingering bitterness comes off almost astringently over the course of the can, and the hefty, sticky, medium-thick viscosity leaves the palate confused. Alcohol is detectable but not overwhelming here with obvious warming. Carbonation, though active, is nice and soft, and is the best part of the feel. 3.75/5
O: This is a fantastic IIPA that lives up to the Alchemist name, but as with most pale beers this high in alcohol, it becomes a little too much for its own good. It is just too much of everything, in fact, and it cannot quite wrangle all the intensity at hand here. Still, this is one of the best high ABV IIPAs out there, and other breweries that traffic in these hard-hitting hefty offerings could learn a lot about making them moderately manageable. From the Alchemist, Focal remains number one and Heady number two, probably largely due to their lesser ABVs. Pair with Protest the Hero's "Scurrilous" for being third best in incredible company. 4.25/5 2,659 charactersTHANAT0PSIS, Oct 23, 2016

Palate Contaminants: other beer
It just looks thick. It really looks like a high-abv stout, but with yellow-orange color. Not much head.
The smell is a little metallic. It has a bit of spice, maybe cinnamon. It's not overly hoppy, and there's a bit of citrus, like tangelos.
The taste has a unique balance. Neither the bitterness or sweetness have a lot of punch, and there's not a lot of savoriness, either. It still blends together nicely, though. Bittersweet citrus is the main driver of this one. There are shades of low-latitude fruits, mostly dried mango and non-sweet dates for me. It's a little weird because every time I take a sip, it's better than I remember from 30 seconds ago. I guess that doesn't speak so well to the aftertaste.
The feel is a good weight for an IPA-type brew, but the aftertaste is nondescript. 860 charactersZythophile, Oct 22, 2016

3.96/5  rDev -11.8%look: 3.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Undated can into pint glass.  Pours a cloudy orangeish-amber (not one of the best-looking brews I've seen).

Alcohol isn't particularly well hidden, although this beer tastes so good that you can kind of ignore the booziness.  This isn't as good as Heady, nor is it as good as a few DPIAs from other brewers, but it's damn good. 521 charactersdbl_delta, Oct 20, 2016

4.34/5  rDev -3.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Pours hazier than other Alchemist beers, pale gold with a nice head.  
Smells bright and very piney with some light citrus nodes, along with some very dry yeast nodes in the back end.  Straightforward for the style, but still handled well.
Tastes a bit more complex than it smells, but still not as complex or unique as, say, Heady.  Big pine up front, a fruitier middle with a little bit of yeast poking through, a finish of very thick, syrupy malt.  Surprisingly old-school. 
Alchemist's deserving reputation has led to this being perhaps a bit more sought after than it should be.  It's still quite good, though. 618 charactersmynie, Oct 18, 2016

4.41/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Appearance: Cloudy lemon drop yellow, with a nice multi-digit tower of bubbly white foam head, amazing retention and stupendous chunks of lacing as it recedes. If you don't drink from the can you will notice a few chunky floaties, but nothing too detrimental. And truly, kind of expected.
Aromatics: Super fresh pineapple and mango with light aromas of fresh cut grass. Not much more though other than it's bright, tropical, and inviting.
Taste: Starts out very juicy with an orange juice sweetness party before the more hoppy flavours decide to pop by. But the hops are not just a bunch of unruly hooligans crashing in with their earthy bitters a blazing, they are a more unified group of Early Grey tea bitter fraternity brothers who know what a good party is all about. They decorate with some greenery, add a top notch DJ scratching out a mix of smooth jazz with some more meaty dance club greats, and they bust out the ice block beer luge and living room volleyball to round out the party. Incredible balance in the hops and malts and you don't even taste the 9%. The aftertaste is mild and sits at the back of the tongue, it's funny though because you know it's there if you focus on it but it doesn't really feel like it's there - kinda of like the new guy on campus who has never been to a good party before and is hesitant to jump in on the action because he doesn't know the protocol.
Mouth: Soft and buttery on the palate with subtle carbonation that does just enough to remind you you are drinking a beer. I love its relationship to the passive middleweight jollyness - The finish is clean and dry but does have a warmth linger a the back of the palate.
Overall: 
Overall: Superb. I don't put it ahead of Alchemist's Heady Topper but it is pretty damn close. It's has a super package of juicy flavour and very drinkable. I'd loved to drink a few of these in succession they are that good. A giant hearty thanks to Greg (@GJKerr) for the can. 
Pairing: Might as well bring on a luau with this one. Here in Canada I would throw a Summer's End Luau so it can be outdoors. Decorate it up - this a beer for festivities, put hula skirts on the cans/bottles, put some lights up in the garden/back yard, hang palm leaves and grass mats in the gazebo, make some tiki gods out of corrugated cardboard, and set up a limbo station. While people are congregating spark up that BBQ and slow cook a few racks of park ribs and slow BBQ at 200F with a BBQ sauce made with pineapple, mango, and jalapeno. Add some cheddar stuffed smokies and a few Angus style burgers - serve it all with fresh pineapple relish and sweet onions. Pairing this baby, is more than just a great food idea - it should be an experience. 2,712 charactersJonCorbett, Oct 17, 2016

Well, like all Alchemist beers, this looks pretty awful (cannot bring myself to drink from the can, but fairly careful poured) Big white floaties, murky but pleasant apricot colored body. small but persistent head. faint lacing. 
Aroma is only faintly of hops. Clean, but no prominent aromas.
Oh boy, what  taste to this one. Hoppy, fruity, bitey. just plain delicious. 
Close to full on the mouth. Some bitter grapefruit on the finish on the back of the mouth. 
Overall, I'm beginning to think that appearance and aroma are irrelevant when it comes to Alchemist beers. (and maybe other breweries) Top notch DIPA. sorry that I only have the single can. 728 charactersMikeWard, Oct 14, 2016

Aroma and taste are powerful. Loaded with hop aroma and bready malt. This definitely is a crusher of taste buds, and not a beer you can crush several of.
This is a very dank beer, grapefruit citrus and pine. 
It's delicious, but a sipper almost. 442 charactersJordonHoltzman, Oct 13, 2016

Poured into a tree house snifter.
Pour is a pale orange, with thin white head and nice lacing.  Slight haze
Aroma- Very dank up front with pine, mango in the back.   Whole lot going on here.
Taste-  I enjoy sweet ipas, but this is borderline too sweet.  I would compare the sweetness to Dogfish 90,  although this is a better beer.    This is not for everyone, but I am digging it.   This is def more west coast style of IPA.
Mouthfeel-   very appropriate for this style.   
Overall-  having had this on consecutive days with Focal Banger, I am not sure which I prefer.
This beer is much boozier, happier and maltier.   Not a beer you can crush 3-4 of.
However, it is very well made beer that I really enjoy.  Hop flavor is really nice.
I would say Focal is a little better but I enjoyed this a lot.  Enjoy both way more than Heady Topper. 866 charactersjcflorian, Oct 02, 2016

Fantastic retention and lacing. The aroma is dank and very hoppy with tropical fruit, grapefruit, orange and some bready malt sweetness. Flavors of tropical fruits, grapefruit, pineapple and hints of mango with a bit of dry pine and malt sweetness on the finish. Medium body that is stick, but finishes nice and dry. Just another superb IPA and not one that I recommend you 'crush.' 474 charactersRi0, Oct 02, 2016
4.59/5  rDev +2.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.75Pour is a medium orange hue, seems a little more hazy than heady or focal. Frothy white head that settles to a rather large ring, nice lacing. Aroma is a bouquet of fresh hops, bursts of pine in the background with a subtle hint of tropical fruit. Mangos, pinneapple, papaya. Hop forward taste as expected, big sappy pine with a finish of peppery like sweet malt. Not much tropical fruit detected, definitely earthy, intensely bitter. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, hoppy palate coating goodness. Overall this is like heady on steroids. Interesting intense hop profile balances well with the subtle maltiness. Great beer. 618 charactersMateo2699, Oct 02, 2016

The beer pours an orange amber color with good head retention and lacing.  On the nose, I was surprised right off by how sweet the beer smelled, with considerable graham cracker aroma.  Yes, there's some noticeable white pepper and dry citrus as well, but the predominant aroma is sweet graham cracker.  The flavor profile is more of the same, though there's some aggressive bitterness from the avalanche of hops on the finish.   It helps to dry the beer out on the finish very well, and was probably the best thing about this beer.  The beer has a medium bodied mouthfeel otherwise, and I felt the alcohol was pretty well integrated into the flavor profile.  
Shrug.  This isn't a bad DIPA, but my expectations for anything made by Alchemist are much higher than "not bad."  So at least for me, this was something of a disappointment. 965 charactersJohn_M, Sep 25, 2016

16 oz can poured into a teku 
A- A hazy orange copper with a three finger white head.
S- Slightly sweet tropical goodness, getting some pineapple and mango, mandarin oranges, some grape fruit, some pine/resin balance out the nose, very fruity in a good way.
T- Citrus, grapefruits, tropical fruits, hints of oranges, touch of malt, nice bitter finish, pine and resin.
M-Smooth, dry, medium to full body.
O- A fanatic DIPA, great balance of fruity and bitter, minimal malt sweetness, very drinkable for 9% ABV.  If you have a hack to try this you need to, been too long since I've had Heady to compare but it is better than Focal Banger. 666 characterslarryi86, Sep 25, 2016

Citrus, pine and big bitter hops lean against a supporting malt backboard that's neither too sweet nor detracts from the hop showcase. Crisp, clean, bright and bitter, this beer should be a sipper but it's easy-drinking; it goes down quick and crushes not only your palette but also your tolerance. Remind yourself to slow down and enjoy it. It's unreal how there's a subtle cascade of flavors with a near 10% ABV. 532 charactersManapuaMan, Sep 24, 2016

No surprises here -- big huge hop flavor -- mostly resin, but a few hints of citrus at the end. As with Heady and Focal, delivers that huge bite but doesn't leave you feeling like you just smoked a cigar and need to scrape your tongue. Very drinkable - maintains a balance even with the hop explosion. 9.6 ABV very much hidden. Another superior product from the folks at Alchemist. A great way to start the weekend,
Which is better? Who cares? - Go to Stowe and pick up all three. 643 characters11-52_4hops, Sep 23, 2016

This one's juicy and sappy on the nose. The label doesn't like. It's a hop farm in a can. Notes of citrus, pine, sap and resin. The fruit balances the astringency nicely but this one's certainly over the top. Beer opens citrus, grapefruit and cane sugar. There's a huge malt body to balance a boatload of hops. Hints of bark, grass and sap in the back with resiny hop bitterness all around. Again, this is a big beer for sure... but I'm not sure how I feel about it. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Smooth and slick in the mouth and goes down bone dry. Gotta love the feel of the beers The Alchemist puts out. 
 The immediate comparison you make with The Crusher is Heady Topper, and in that comparison, its no contest. This beer lacks a certain balance where the sweetness is overpowering on the palate and the hop bitterness is overpowering in the aftertaste. Its still solid, but easily the weakest of the Alchemist pale ales. 969 charactersSpeedwayJim, Sep 23, 2016
4.5/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A - Pours an opaque, golden orange with a thick off white head.
S - Clearly a double as the hops are cranked up and dominate.
T - Mango/orange on the front, a little bready, then the bitterness comes in.  But none of this is jarring because it is so well balanced.
M - A bit sticky like all good DIPA's, medium carbonation.
O - While I like Focal and Heady more, this is a great beer.  Drink them in order and enjoy. 416 charactersspacecake9, Sep 23, 2016
4.47/5  rDev -0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Straight pour from a 16oz can to an oversized wineglass—Jester King stemware, as usual. This was purchased at the Stowe brewery about two weeks prior to consumption, and refrigerated consistently since. Must be two to two and a half weeks old, max, at the time of consumption. 
Appearance (4.5): Three to four fingers of custard-colored foam rise off of the pour, capping a hazy but not quite cloudy, deep orange body. The head dies down very, very slowly, like annoyingly slow. It leaves a cratery, meringue-like cap and wide, splotchy arcs of lace. This is beautiful, and right on the nose for the style. 
Smell (4.25): Overripe pineapple, toasted country bread with honey on it, light grassy and strong floral notes jump out at the start. A touch of pine and weird spicy tones paired with very rich peach and nectarine scents follow—the peach and pine combination really does it for me. 
Taste (4.5): Holy cow, this is rich and intense! Honey sweet, sugar cookie-like malt is paired with sweet pineapple and mango, but any sweetness is then promptly torn apart by intense grapefruit bitterness—pith, zest, and a combo of sweetened and unsweetened juice. Jesus, that’s a great, bitter finish. It’s got resinous undertones as well, which help mask some of the heat inherent to a beer of this size. It’s fairly smooth, but there’s no hiding its size at 9% ABV. The pineapple upside-down cake and grapefruity, citrusy, resinous bitterness are juxtaposed in a way that offers a surprisingly smooth transition for such a stark contrast. More and more resin in the finish as the drink goes on. 
Mouthfeel (4.75): Full-bodied but not heavy, the body is almost shockingly smooth, boosted by tingly (at first) carbonation that then spreads out nicely across the palate with a smooth, velvety blanket. It gives way to extreme dryness, thanks to an intense wave of hop oils. It’s somehow rich and smooth, but dry and inviting at the same time. I love it. 
Overall (4.5): This is an outstanding “East Coast” type of DIPA with lots of the New England (D)IPA influence. It feels and drinks appropriate to its size, but it’s still so much fun to drink at the same time. That said, it’s no Heady—but, they are different beers for a reason. This is richer and more satisfying in a way that Heady is lighter and more nimble. If you ask me, this is better considered a companion to something like Heady, in a slightly different peer group of DIPAs. Definitely recommended if you like world-class DIPAs that come at you a little bigger, fuller, and harder, and ask for slower, more thoughtful consumption. 2,618 charactersfmccormi, Sep 22, 2016

3.84/5  rDev -14.5%look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.75Picked up at the brewery, enjoyed three days later.
Relatively translucent but fairly opaque pour. Yellowish orange, sort of looks like an Arnold Palmer colour-wise. Stark white head, persists for a bit then recedes. Fairly low carbonation, wouldn't mind a little bit more of the bubbles.
Hop aroma less intense than either Heady Topper or Focal Banger; nice and hoppy but not overwhelming. Next time will drink from the can and compare.
Intensely hoppy in flavour. Pine, citrus, mango, guava, peaches. Fruity but resinous and sticky with a (really) lingering bitterness, this is a hop lover's beer. The alcohol is well hidden here, doesn't taste boozy at all to me. 
The description on the can suggests the finish is dry, but I really don't agree. The smooth maltiness is robust enough to stand up to the hops, and leaves you with a slightly sweet aftertaste.
Overall, a bracingly hoppy IPA. Having tried this a second time, I've reduced my original score a little bit. Of all the Alchemist beers I've had, it's my least favourite. The bitterness is somehow harsher here, just nowhere near as tasty as HT or FB. 1,117 characterskylesobrien, Sep 19, 2016

Earthy, dank, pine and resin will all shine in this beer.  The mildly sweet malt profile compliments those ingredients quite well, yet somehow is still very easy to drink (like many NE IPA/DIPAs) with that distinct NE after taste.
Out of the 3 Alchemist beers I've had, Focal Banger is still my favorite, then Crusher and then Heady Topper... by no means are any of them anything but great beers. 464 characterseifster82, Sep 17, 2016

Not getting much malt either. 
Feel is on the thicker side of medium, rich and creamy. A delicious and well-made beer. I'd drink Heady and esp Focal Banger every day if I could. I'd reserve this one for late weekend nights after my palate has been crushed. 537 charactersBeers-es, Sep 15, 2016

The flavor follows with creamy experience and chewy breadiness. pineapple, mangoes, passionfruit, peach, dankness and herbaceous on the back. It shows itself as a huge beer towards the back of the palate.
However, as it warms, the malts and alcohol really take over.
Certainly a different animal from Heady and Focal, but just gets messy with any hit of temperature. 531 charactersdar482, Sep 14, 2016

 The color is a pale golden with hazed clarity and thin white head with lasting retention and fine bead, lace sticks in rings. The smell is great -lots of tropical fruit with citrus in the hop aroma. the feel is also excellent pure hop resins and mild bitterness for the heft of ale with a nice relatively dry finish.
 The taste is great - lots of hop flavor without any malt to cloud the taste mild yeast in the taste but mostly grapefruit and dank herb from the hops with a slight peppery aspect in the back. This is a top notch Imperial IPA which focuses on the hop aroma and flavor with very little alcohol apparent that makes it very irresistible. 729 charactersSlatetank, Sep 06, 2016

Served in a snifter
Big thanks to my friend Bill for grabbing me a few cans of this on his recent trip to The Alchemist.
Hazy, glowing orangey-amber appearance. The body was topped by a tight and creamy, two-finger tall, off-white crown. Terrific retention. The head slowly fell to a thin film. A mix of streaky, blocky and drippy lacing stuck along the glass.
The nose was pungently hoppy. Really citrusy and bright. Juicy. Orange and tangerine notes were most apparent. Slight sweetness. Almost a bit honey-like. There was a noticeable yeasty quality as well. After having a can of Heady last night, I could have sworn this was the same beer.
Citrusy hops also came through strong in the flavor profile. Orange notes dominated. Both flesh and rind. Slightly sweet up front. Nice pale malt backbone. As the liquid moved along the palate, the beer turned much more bitter. White grapefruit and grapefruit rind notes took over. Super pithy and dry. There was a subtle, chalky yeastiness. The beer finished with loads of piney, resiny bitterness and more grapefruit rind. Almost a touch astringent.
The mouthfeel was one of my favorite aspects of the beer. It was medium bodied and contained a super fine, zippy effervescence that turned frothy and supple on the palate. Really creamy, slick and smooth.
The Alchemist are true game changers in the craft beer world and are responsible for the proliferation of all the incredible New England-style pale ales, IPAs and double IPAs available today. That said, some of their highly acclaimed beers now seem a bit dated. While I have tremendous respect for these folks, I unfortunately do not love some of their offerings as much as I once did. 1,716 charactersDamian, Sep 05, 2016

I drank it out of the can as the brewmaster recommends so I can't comment on the look. But the smell is wonderful and the mouthfeel is excellent -warm and smooth. 285 characterssmaddock, Sep 04, 2016

Dull looking satin orange color; 1-plus F white cap, gentle fade with some rings of lacing. Hop resin floated on top of the foam, and there was plenty of resin in the bottom of the glass.  Beautiful and ugly at the same time. Conspicuous in its absence is the "drink from the can" command, thankfully.
Hops jump from the can a soon as the seal breaks. Lots of strong tropical and citrus fruit aromas, some pine. Underlying note of sweet malt. 
Starts with slightly sweet tropical fruit flavor then the citrus takes charge and keeps the sugar in check. Dry earth and raw alcohol.  
Big beer, big full feel. The can reads 9% abv and it comes on strong, a bit of booze burn. Rampage hopping leads to a clean-leaning dry finish. 
A monster all the way. This review comes after trying Crusher a few times so I could review the beer rather than vice-versa. As much as I like it, one is enough - til next time. 955 charactersNiceTaps, Sep 02, 2016

A: Pours a beautiful gold color. Carbonation there. Plenty of sediment swirling. Decent head - probably two fingers of clean white - more foamy than soapy.
S: Hoppy, citrusy, and pine-y on the smell.
T: Citrusy hops up front. That pine in the middle. Alcohol on the back end - it is 9%, so you get a little burn. Very powerful.
M: Wet and medium-bodied.
O: Very high hopes with the ratings, and it didn't disappoint. It won't crack my top 10 because it isn't my favorite style, but for the style, it is very, very good. Grab one if you're 'travelling in the North Country.' 619 charactersChicagoPartisan, Aug 31, 2016

Pours a very hazy light golden sunset colored body with a frothy white head that that reduces slowly to leave a layer of retention and spotty lacing.
Aromas of grapefruit, pine, dankness. Same on the tongue with some bitterness coming on the finish. Easy drinker for 9%, super smooth with no booze..
Solid, great price point, would drink a lot of this if it were available closer. 486 charactersgcamparone, Aug 27, 2016

Nose expresses delicate citrus notes, a hint of toasted malt and a light earthy quality.  Taste expresses equal parts citrus, equal parts earthy/herbal with a kiss of toasted malt.  Mouthfeel is light-medium with an easy, even carbonation, a light prickly and a mild acidity.

Look: It has a yellow slightly golden hazy color with a thick bubbly white head leaving nice lacing.
Aroma: It has an inviting tart, fruity, dank, and hoppy aroma.
Taste: Piney, grassy, juicy, dank, grapefruit, mango, and nice hop bitterness that is substantial but not too aggressive. Overall it had a wonderful flavor.
Feel: Lighter body, medium carbonation. 509 charactersThomas_Wikman, Aug 24, 2016

L- Opaque, gold. with a 3/4 inch head that stays around for a while.  Beautiful.
S- Juicy with a tad of pine and dankness.  Hop aroma is a great way to say it to me.
T- Some bitterness but so much less than a normal beer with this much hop.  There's a little less bite at the end than Focal has, so I like it a bit better for that.
F- The mouth feel is similar to the other 2.  Full and complementary to the taste.
O- See above.  I would rank this just behind heady topper, just ahead of focal banger, and way above most other beers I've ever had :) 754 charactersChuckdiesel24, Aug 22, 2016

A:
Cloudy hay in the glasswith 3 fingers beige foam insulation that drops in a slow settle to a thick film with good retention and swooping lace.  (4.5)
S:
Green citrus and weed (wow!). Stonefruits, tangerines, lime zest, bittersweet potpourri.  (4.5)
T:
Tidal wave of oily bittersweet citrus rind, the gunk around lawnmower blades, herbs, some medicinal alcohol in the rising, sticky, sappy, lacquer-like finish.  (4.5)
M:
Creamy, soft with medium carbonation bite, coating and rich, lingering hop-alcohol tingle.  (4.75)
O:
Intense IIPA, to say the least.
Heady and others may be nothing more than distilled hop flavors.  This one is like hop oil mixed with raw blended hops.  Earthy and sweet aroma with lots of apricots, herbs and herb.  The beer as a whole is pretty much on the same page in this respect.  Intense hop layers with high, sticky, resinous bitterness with just enough background peaches and clementine skin to not burn you out.  The feel is my favorite part aspect of this beer, though.  Lightly prickly with a coating soft/creamy feel with a lingering finish that further shows you the hop flavors in this beer.  Would have again; I might as well use the word intense at least once more in this review for good luck.  (4.5) 1,292 charactersTheDoctor, Aug 22, 2016

4.04/5  rDev -10%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4appearance- Bright orange and hazy.  Pours a soapy three to four inch head.
aroma- Citrus, grapefruit, pine, and mango.
taste- Starts with the classic west coast tastes of citrus and grapefruit, but in the middle it switches up to tangerine and mango flavors, and then it the finish it diverts back ot west coast with bitter pine and grapefruit.  A doughy malt adds some flavor, body, and helps keep the finish dry. A little boozy at times.
feel- Medium/full bodied and medium/high carbonation.  Definitely a 9% beer that feels bigger than it is in terms of feel and taste.
overall- The epitome of how over the top a dipa can be and still have some semblance of balance.  Easily one of if not the biggest, booziest, and most flavorful dipa that I've had. There's a big array of hop flavors ranging from west coast to east coast juice hops that deliver big flavor and bitterness. A great beer to round off a case of heady and focal banger, and possibly the best of the three. 978 charactersCTbrew32, Aug 20, 2016

A- Pours a nearly opaque medium amber color with a 3/4 inch head that retains well before becoming a thick ring around the edge of the glass and a mostly full sheet of surface foam.  Semi-resilient lacing leaves large clots behind.
S- Juicy and dank hop aroma with some malt sweetness.  Has that Froot Loops thing going on.
T- Contains lots of resinous pine and grass as well as plenty of fruity character and malt sweetness.  Assertive bitterness and quite smooth for the ABV.
M- Has a soft feel along with a sharpness from the hops.  Medium carbonation and a body leaning toward the lighter side.
O- Man oh man, is this a hop monster.  Bursting with flavor and bitterness but restrained enough to stay thoroughly quaffable.  Not as crushable as heady (pun intended), but that's to be expected from the higher ABV. 867 charactersImmortale25, Aug 19, 2016

4.55/5  rDev +1.3%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Poured from the 16oz can just picked up from the brewery on August 4, consumed on Monday the 8th. Super fresh! Into a Foam Brewers snifter this beer is a very cloudy deep orange color with a fluffy head that leaves good lacing splotches.
Smell is huge, this is like the first time a few years ago when I cracked open my first Heady Topper, big hop aromas bursting out of the can signal that this beer doesn't hold back. Flavor wise you have a malt sweetness that's prevalent through the whole beer but it's never too overpowering. Big pine, citrus, raw hop leaf, some pineapple notes, and resin flavors that linger long after the swallow. This is how I expect New England breweries to do the West Coast style.
Big body, leaning towards heavy, somewhat dry on the finish and a bit warm in the stomach but still smooth. Overall this is a beast and it has earned its name. 871 charactersBranfordBound, Aug 15, 2016

Acquired at the brewery last Wednesday.  Poured from the 16 oz. can (against the advice on the can to drink from the can) into an Alchemist stemmed snifter
a: Hazy orange with a finger and a half thick white head which receded to thin surface foam and dense patchy laving
s: Citrus rind with floral notes.
t: Follows the nose with a blast of citrus over a medium bready malt base.  Bitternes lingers in the back of the throat.  Tangerine-like dry finish.  Strong grassy notes later testify to the intensity and freshness of the hops.  As the can suggests, dangerously drinkable.
m: Medium plus, very good body and carbonation tingle.
o: Smoother than Focal despite 2% higher ABV, a real fruity hop blast DIPA,  First tasted this while in line waiting for my mixed case and was blown away by the floral goodness.  Here in the can the citrus stands out more, with juiciness above and beyond either of the other two legendary Alchemist IPAs.  Now I know why this reportedly sells out before either of the others, and why the woman in line in front of me said it was her favorite. 1,113 charactersscotorum, Aug 15, 2016

The Crusher is topped with a very large, foamy, slightly more dense, almost khaki head leaving shit tons of spongy lace.
Smell is earthy, with a little lemon-lime candy, corn, Colby jack, and that similar hint of apple cider vinegar in the background. Not all that different from Focal.
Taste is stronger in pine and resin than Focal, with more earthiness and grapefruit as well. 
Overall this is strongly bitter, but not overpowering as I expected. Very dry finish. 589 charactersSabtos, Aug 13, 2016

4.08/5  rDev -9.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Thanks to mymrnngjckt for the hookup on this. A pounder can poured into a tulip shaped pint appears hazy copper in color with a foamy off-white cap resting atop that fades leaving stringy lace.
Aroma has some citrus zestiness that gets herbal and almost minty with some fruity hop feel. The alcohol creeps forward with a touch of its own fruitiness.
Taste is almost sugary at first but really dries out and becomes pithy/pulpy with a hint of grapefruit. The hop oils linger on the tongue bringing out some fruity alcohol notes.
This is medium to lighter bodied with a moderate to lower level of carbonation. This brew goes down pretty easy to the extent of almost inducing a head rush. Woah, this really grows on you as you work through it. 743 charactersstakem, Aug 11, 2016

Appearance: pours a super bright and vibrant orange color, with a sudsy white head. Head lingers for a few minutes, leaving sticky lacing. Body is very hazy, but doesn't carry all the little hop particles or chunks in Focal and Heady.
Aroma: banging orange and citrus, with plenty of grapefruit flesh and pith. Pretty solid amount of bitterness here too. Lots of pine.
Taste: again, astonishingly juicy as the dominant taste, but with plenty of prickling bitterness on the finish. Most DIPAs being produced now seem to shirk the bittering in favor of extra soft and juicy flavor, but not this brew. Lots of pine and bitterness on the end. Still, plenty of grapefruit and citrus flavor as well.
Feel: slightly dry finish, but with a very thick mouthfeel and medium carbonation.
Overall: a great brew from the Alchemist, and a very balanced take on the IIPA. 902 charactersTheElectricOne, Aug 10, 2016

L: 2F head with good retention, no lacing, but leaves lasting cap and ring. Beer is an opaque, but not hazy golden copper.
S: Tons of grapefruit, orange peel, tangelo, lemon and lime peel. Back end is an earthy dank piney scent.
T: Grapefruit and orange, lemon and lime. Enough sweet malt to balance the bitterness and bring to earthy, piney dry finish. 
F: Medium bodied, light to medium carbonation. Good drying on palate. Good balance of malt and hops. Only the tiniest evidence of alcohol at the end of the finish. Scary drinkable for this ABV.
O: Been waiting a long time to try this and it totally delivers. Definitely competes well with Lawson's Peril and others at the high ABV end of the DIPA universe. 849 charactersIvoryFoxhole, Aug 10, 2016

4.32/5  rDev -3.8%look: 4.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5This beer pours a vibrant cloudy golden orange with a 2 finger foamy white head that sticks around forever and leaves webbed chunks of lacing. The smell is orange, grapefruit, citrus pith, dank pine and sweet malts. Taste is the same. A little too sweet and malty for my liking, but super hoppy nonetheless. Feel is excellent. Medium-full, oily and sticky with a prickly bitter finish. Very drinkable though. Overall a very good beer. 9%+ DIPAs are normally too malty for me and this is no exception. But at the same time it is definitely a hop wallop upside the head, just wish it was a touch less sweet. 605 charactersCNoj012, Aug 07, 2016

S: Pineapple, mango, grapefruit and dank hops.
T: Similar to the nose. Has a bitter grapefruit note to the back end. Pineapple tropical citrus is also apparent.
M: Moderate carbonation, sticky, dry hoppy finish. Seems to be moderately high in regards to bitterness. 
O: The dry, dank, sticky, bitter and hoppy notes are essentially what defines this beer. I thought it was more dry/bitter than most double IPA's yet it still is a solid beer. Nicely done Alchemist! 516 charactersMA_hops, Aug 06, 2016

M. Thick feel, bitter, moderate carbonation.
O. Worth the hype - not sure. Very malty - and this was fresh. Extremely hoppy so the malts act as a balance. This is a little sweet and lots of flavors but not delicate or pillowy as I have come to expect from top notch HOPS. 506 charactersmacher0, Aug 03, 2016

Look is semi-hazy orange colored brew with minimal lacing.  
Smell is the only downside of this brew as it will t blow you away.  Hops, slight citrus, and just enough.
Taste is great.  Hoppy, citrus, a touch of bitter and super balanced.
Feel is medium bodied with a long finish. 
Overall a great brew. I only had one but I'm glad to finally try it.  Would drink again anytime.  Such a good brewery. 521 charactersJay_P22, Jul 24, 2016

4.75/5  rDev +5.8%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Mastering the art of making India pale ale only leads to hop-heads wanting more. And its that push of the envelope that causes the Alchemist brewer to go absolutely ballistic with the scarce cones.  Using the most irresistible hops on the planet with the techniques that allow the beer to have a succulent upstart and a gripping dry finish gives The Crusher a taste that linger much longer in memory as it does on the palate.
The imperial IPA pours a turbid, tapioca hue of peach and gold. Capped with a creamy off-white meringue, the lacy beer lures the senses with teeth-churning scents of tropical fruit juices, citrus juices, an bright herbal complement, and an underlying candied sweet scent of saltwater taffy. Its taste is juicy with hops, fruit and angel-food cake maltiness. Its sweetness is tangy and offers an ideal reprieve from the brunt of hop onslaught to come.
The taste explodes on the middle palate as the tropical taste of mango, apricot, pineapple, kiwi, passionfruit and dragon fruit blend seamlessly with lemon, red grapefruit, blood orange and lime.  With the tethers of malt lingering behind, its sweetness rounds the fruit hop impressions for a decadent sherbet-like finish. Albeit bitter, the ales lasting moments are smooth with fresh grassiness, herbal and light cannabis charm.
Medium-bodied, the beer's gripping bitterness and drying trek carries the drinkability of standard American IPA, but it's elevated alcohol suggests another, slower plan. As the ale trails with the resinous bite of fresh pine shavings, fruit peel and herb, its quite evident that IPA making doesn't get better than this. 1,629 charactersBEERchitect, Jul 19, 2016

Smell is of earthiness, pine, pineapple, grapefruit trace amounts of orange zest and bready malt sweetness. Taste is killer! Tons of hops perfectly blended with the malts this one could easily be too sweet or too hoppy but the balance here is pure symmetry. You get a ton of tropical fruits-grapefruit, pineapple and hints of mango throughout with a light bit of pineyness and dry malt sweetness in the tailend. Nice dry cloying finish leaves you begging for more. Overall, I had high expectations for this beer which and am usually let down but this beer lives up to the billing, A truly stellar example of the style and worth seeking out. 724 charactersking75, Jul 19, 2016

I'd be guessing galaxy/mosaic/simcoe??? you get a good whiff of alcohol but nothing that would turn you off. too much fruity goodness to sip on. Tastes great, lots of earthy hops coming through and it's a big boy, the way a DIPA should be! a slight bitter/dry finish but it's just right... this beer has been perfected.

Not too different in appearance from its siblings, hazy orange-yellow with a heap of healthy white head. Focal and Heady are definitely two of my favorite IPAs, but Crusher to me just doesn't stack up to them. It's just got that "too much DIPAy-ness," mainly too much maltiness, with an accompanying high hop content that gives it a raw oiliness and therefore a slick, sticky, and heavy feel. I won't ever turn this down if it's put in front of me, but I would reach for many other options first. 519 charactersRifugium, Jul 16, 2016

The beer pours a really beautiful golden apricot color, hazy and cloudy with a solid finger of foamy white head, good retention and nice swatches of soapy lace. The aroma is nice, juicy tropical fruit and citrus rind, earthy pine, resinous hop oils, green hop spice with some light alcohol and soft cracker malt as a backbone. The flavors are really intense, monster tropical hop burst, bitter grapefruit rind, really earthy hops, green, grassy, spicy, very bitter with a strong cereal grain backbone and a boozy punch at the finish. This beer is a total and complete palate wrecker, blast after blast of sticky and stripping hop goodness. The mouthfeel is very good, coating, medium body, gentle and soft, light prickliness to the carbonation and a dry finish with a touch of warmth.
Verdict: A nice DIPA from The Alchemist, but boy is it intense and strong. The flavors, while bitter and assertive, have enough brightness and complexity to really satisfy and despite being nearly 10% ABV, this beer is still somewhat refreshing. While it's called the Crusher, this is not a crushable beer, this beer does the crushing. 1,235 characterskevanb, Jul 16, 2016

Hazy, golden, bit of an orange glow when you hold it up to the light.  The head is white and foamy, large bubble pop and dissipate quickly leaving a small ring around my glass.  There is a serious amount of lacing that sticks to the glass after each sip.
Lots and lots of hops.  They are not joking in the description.  Earthy dankness with ripe tropical fruits.  A touch of resinous pine as well.
Giant punch in the mouth of front end hops.  Gives you a bit of a numb feeling on your lips.  Tropical flavors try their best to sneak through the earthy hop whallop.  The malts are noticeable in the finish and give it a slightly sweet caramel flavor.
Pretty full bodied, on the high side of moderate carbonation. 
Big, bold, tasty and in your face.  Not for people that kind of like hops.  This is for full on hop lovers.  They do a good job of keeping it very drinkable.  I enjoyed it to the last drop and am happy that it seems like it will hang around at the brewery for a while. 1,072 charactersjhavs, Jul 07, 2016

Orange, mango and hemp, pine and pineapples.

feels bubbly and smooth at the same time its bitter at the end. All the things that make me love 2x and 3x ipas this has in spades.
its so good I went just for this one to todays sale. I was lucky to trade in the new place to make a full case with some nice  people as I live not to far and its my favorite.
I give it a 5 because really only post the great ones that I love. I rarely post and this one deserved a mention.
New brewery is easy in and out. lots of parking but get their early and go on off months like april and November if your gonna go and try to get a lot.

The aroma is very sweet at first. I get loads of mango and melon, orange, and sweet caramel. There's a ton of grapefruit on the back end as well as plenty of sticky pine resin. Alcohol is well hidden. 
The flavor is an atomic hop bomb. It's just an explosion of grapefruit and pine with some more subtle tropical notes to balance out the bitterness. The malt is also very present and adds a subtly sweet doughy flavor. The alcohol is present but not overpowering. 
The feel is medium bodied with pretty high carbonation. Very creamy, yet very sticky. Absolutely coats the mouth with lingering hop resins. 
Overall, this is just a monster of a DIPA. Definitely one of the bigger "hop bombs" I've had. Despite this, it's also nicely balanced with a strong malt backbone. Even though I've had DIPA's with much larger ABV's, this one just hits you like a truck. This is an absolute apocalypse on my palate and I love it. 1,129 charactersScaryEd, Jul 05, 2016

Slightly hazy pale with a decent sized long lasting head. Huge pine and resin with hints of earth and onion. Faint maltiness barely balances here.  Resinous hop flavor with just enough crackery malt and a firm level of bitterness. Medium body and carbonation. Fantastic brew! 343 charactersjohnnnniee, Nov 15, 2014

Nice white head, and lace on the glass. Head dissipates somewhat fast but lace hangs on. There are visible floaters in there, which I really like, that were all sitting at the bottom of the can. Nose is sweet and bourbon mollassesy with some bubble gum and pecan nuttiness and toastiness. Hops and citrus smells are there. Taste is the same for the most part. Very crisp and yet creamy, oddly smooth and alcohol very present. Hops all over the after taste. This is extremely good. My only regret is I can't go to the store down the street and pick up some more. 702 characterscambabeer, Nov 10, 2014

4.35/5  rDev -3.1%Huge thanks to Joe_Grizzly for sending me a tanker full of Alchemist brews, I actually hopped up & down in excitement when the UPS truck stopped in front of the house today. Slightly dented 16 oz. silver bullet, going down. 
The pop & pour features a light orange beer with heady carbonation. A wave of calypso hits the nose before the I even get the tab all the way down: massive tropical fruits, sweet bread, mango, a whole island full of ripened fruit. Beautiful. 
The Crusher hands your nose sweets while hiding the predator van keys in the other hand. Fallen fruit litter the palate, & there’s a nascent sweetness, but they’re accompanied by a razor of cleansing bitterness storming hard on its heels, very reminiscent of Heady (please ignore my stupid review of Heady, which was from the initial ‘bottling’ & not that great). Hard, searing citrus burns away the fruit like a morning fog off of Lake Minnetonka (“yeah, but that’s not Lake Minnetonka”). End-game is a quick peck of sweet malt, touch of pine, alcohol that grows as it warms. Sticky, gooey, dry. Which seems odd. Glad they put this in 16 oz. cans, & glad I didn’t have to share this one. 
Was thinking of bringing cans to Darkness Day later this week, but I’m not sure there’s anyone out there I like enough to share this with. Yeah, I mean you. I usually despise “balanced” IIPAs, but The Alchemist got this one right. Not quite on the level with the elites, but a damn excellent brew. 1,482 charactersmaximum12, Oct 21, 2014

4.75/5  rDev +5.8%16oz can purchased on 10/4/14 at The Alchemist's truck sale. Poured into a snifter tasting glass. 
A - Solid golden amber.
S - Big juicy fruity hop aroma.  A little dankness.  Very intense and inviting. You can't help but smile after getting your nose in the glass.
T - Lots of citrusy, bitter hop flavor up front with a nice, resiny finish.  It definitely packs a punch of hop flavor. Pushes hop flavor to a nice limit. 
M - Nice medium-bodied mouthfeel until the end when you get a hint of the true ABV.  Still finishes dry enough that you don't hesitate for more. 
O - Fantastic beer.  Really big on hop flavor while still being very drinkable and not muddling the hoppy goodness with malt sweetness.  The aroma is very nice. I think of this one could arguably be classified as a "Triple IPA".  I drank it fairly fast and I'm feeling the ABV. More flavorful than Heady, but at the cost of some drink-ability. 917 charactersHeadyTheElder, Oct 08, 2014

4.75/5  rDev +5.8%Can into Alchemist stemless wine glass.
Pours gorgeously turbid, orange juice hazy, golden amber hued light orange in color. Sports a pretty frothy two finger head that lingers nicely and leaves pretty lacing. 4.75
Aroma is full of "clean" citrus notes, mango, papaya, pungent herbs, watermelon, vanilla?(Wow), earthy peach notes like flesh that's not overly sweet , minerals, pear, and soft banana. Loving this aroma. Unique, has that New Zealand hop like kick with passion fruit even coming in briefly. Better than heady topper. 4.75
The taste presents a more bitter citrus character but with plenty of those tropical fruits that were on the nose. Also has that herbal edge from the aroma. Getting that passionfruit, underripe orange, pineapple, banana, white nectarine, rosemary, sweet spruce, guava, and even some elderflowers. Magnificent. 4.75
Mouthfeel sports a smooth, heavier light body and nice bubbly carbonation that doesn't aggress. Bitterness is well measured and keeps this double IPA in super drinkable territory. Really dry, not much residual sweetness. 4.75
This is world class. No doubt. Already liking this better than heady topper. This and focal banger I like more so that's something to say. This is F-ing delicious. 1,249 charactersMarcWP, Sep 03, 2014

4.75/5  rDev +5.8%Got this thanks to a very generous fellow out of Vermont that's not on ba, but thanks matt!
im pretty sure these were canned a few weeks ago so this is very fresh, I poured half into a glass and drank the other half from the can.
Appearance:  A bit lighter then heady, more of a bright citrus orange, pretty hazy but you can see through it just a touch unlike heady.  looks great!
Smell:  WOW!  Just like having my first heady I get punched in the face with a huge amount of hops, citra to be exact.  not much sweetness or booze in the nose, some malt but not too much, a touch of caramel sweetness and hop bitterness.  I like the aroma on this more then heady.
Taste:  :  Follows the nose for the most part, very dank and more bitter then heady to my knowledge, but very smooth, the hop oils just linger in your mouth and make you crave more and more.  
Mouthfeel:  oily, thick, highly carbed, very nice!
Overall:  I never thought I would have a beer that would beat out heady but i'll be damned if this hasn't.  The only thing I can think of that would make it better is if the aroma didn't fade so quickly but that's about all I can think of.  Amazing ipa something every hophead should try once in their life. 1,214 charactersfounder26, Sep 02, 2014

4.5/5  rDev +0.2%Crusher, Poured a tulip glass.
A-	Has a deep apricot color and nice haze making it non transparent. A fluffy two finger rich creamy looking head.  As the head recedes it leaves behind some chunky lacing the sticks well to the side of the glass. 
S-    The smell is of pineapple and apricot. Not a huge nose on this beer but what is there is very smooth. 
T-    Up front it has a big piney taste with little alcohol burn, as the alcohol fades a smooth fruitiness takes over. Again like the smell the fruit flavors are faint and play second to the piney and resin taste.
M-   Mouth feel is crisp and light. The alcohol coats the inside of your mouth and cleans the tongue between sips.
O-    IMO this is a great tasting beer that is smooth all around with a great balance of sweet and bitter. I find it hard to identify a particular taste that stands out in this one. I guess that’s a good thing. 898 charactersMo_fro, Sep 01, 2014

S - Spicy tropical fruit with some malt to balance out the nose.  
T - Citrus rules this beer from start to finish, very resiny and full of flavor.  Spicy tropical fruit with a moderately sweet topical and pine resin bitterness on the back end.
M - Big bodied and robust for a Double IPA, darn near perfect, IMO. Dry.
O - I love Heady Topper from this brewery but this rivals it.  Highly, highly recommended. 509 charactersjzeilinger, Aug 30, 2014

5/5  rDev +11.4%16 oz. can gifted from GMRFx, unknown can date but purchased at the most recent Alchemist tent sale on 08/11/2014, poured into a small plastic glass at a BJCP study group, drank 08/27/2014 over an hour.
A: 3/3 - golden-orange coloration, minimal clarity (cannot see or read through), off-white head dissipates into a glass lacing that persisted throughout the drinking session, some chunky brown floaters in there but whatever; moderate alcohol legs for an imperial IPA
S: 11/12 - as expected, huge hop aroma right up front: super intense citrus and tropical fruit - mango, pineapple and papaya predominate; some alcohol and malt notes are also present but the hops are front and center
T: 19/20 - on the anterior tongue, there's a slight bitterness but is quickly overpowered in the middle of the mouth by huge pineapple, mango and tangerine notes (likely a heavy handed Citra dry hopping); some background grapefruit and peach; the alcohol is present in the taste with some minor malt characters to hint at balancing
M: 4/5 - full-bodied with thick hop oils coating the tongue, 9.6% is present but not overbearing (more like a single IPA at times); high carbonation for style/ABV and moderate carbonation
O: 10/10 - one of the best Citra-forward beers that I have ever had; on the DIPA level, I think that this surpasses HT and reminds me a lot of Surly Abrasive or Pipeworks Citra Ninja - so juicy, refreshing and just damn flavorful; I would drink this until the Holy Cows come home, wow!

4.65/5  rDev +3.6%Did a blind tasting on 8/29/14 with the recent batches of Focal Banger, Rapture, The Crusher and Heady Topper.
The Crusher was slightly darker in color than Focal Banger with a hazy/unfiltered orange color.  On the nose I got cream orange, slight piney-ness and resin.  Not as complex as the other Alchemist beers I tried.
The taste was amazing. Super balanced throughout between the bitterness and sweetness plus a big mouthfeel.  
Overall, this was my favorite of the four beers.  I found myself continuing to go back for more.  At 9.6%ABV it masks and balances everything extremely well.  I hope they make this part of their normal rotation going forward. 663 charactersDCLAguy11, Aug 14, 2014

Pours a hazy yellow/light orange hue with excellent carbonation and head retention. The aroma runs the gamut of tropical fruits with a Piney undertone, slight malt nose and just a hint of the high abv present. Tastes like a creamy mix of mango, papaya with several layers of hop flavor. The beer finishes incredibly smooth even though the mouthfeel is just so viscous and chewy. Another gem from Waterbury's (soon to be Stowe's) favorite brewer. This beer is worth seeking out. 538 charactersbeerjunky413, Jul 29, 2014

4.56/5  rDev +1.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.516oz can from the recent truck release. Poured into a Lawson's Finest snifter 7/26/2014.
A- As expected, beautiful hazy light copper body with a two finger foamy and effervescent white head that lingers for quite a long time. Rings of lacing remain as I drink the beer. Typical but welcome Vermont IPA appearance.
S- As soon as I cracked the can, waves of mango, grapefruit and floral scents bursts out, and has a lot of staying power even when poured into a glass. Quite simply put, this is a very intense and complex nose. Grapefruit, passion fruit, floral noses combine with a nice sweet caramel and bread pale malt backbone. Simultaneously aggressive on all fronts yet balanced together; this beer has a nose that comes in Double Sunshine proportions.
F- Almost just as good as the nose promises. Grapefruit and passion fruit notes hit up front, becomes balanced by a nice honey and caramel pale malt sweetness which is then buttressed by a strong floral and citrus finish accentuated by a floral bitterness that lingers. Very nice profile, excellent complexity and balance despite the ginormous amount of hoppiness. Well-executed.
M- Medium in body, straddles dry and resinous perfectly, almost creamy and close to the perfect amount of carbonation. For the strong, slightly boozy malt backbone that this beer has, it's incredibly drinkable. 
O- An incredibly hopped up beer with a strong pale malt backbone; all components are rich and strong enough to balance each other out but without sacrificing any of the good qualities that each individual component of the beer brings. I prefer Focal Banger as far as Alchemist offerings go, but I actually enjoy this more than Heady Topper. Damn fine liquid. 1,711 charactersStevedore, Jul 26, 2014

Dark yellow..opaque...some webbing.
Smells of sweet sweet tropicality...pineapple is noticeable. Nose is awesome...very vibrant.
Just gobs of peach, pineapple, guava, and mango smashed into a pulp. Big malt support. Sticky and boozy.
Some great flavors, nice hop notes, and a real punch in my ugly grill. Were the booze not so unrelenting this might be a real gem. As is, it's a very good DIPA that falls short of great. 474 charactersBarrytheBear, Jul 21, 2014
4.49/5  rDev 0%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Can shared by Curran, thanks dude.
Pours a hazy golden blonde color, with a half inch head, and a good amount of lacing.
Smells like a big ol blast of tropical fruit, some slight booze, lots of grapefruit.
This is much more grapefruity and citrusy than the other two Alchemist IPAs I've had- Focal and HT. A little bit catty, lots of dankness. A bit more of a malt presence than I expected, then again, it's 9.6%. The malt is less of a taste and more of a presence, per se- you can feel the heft of this one.
Medium bodied, slightly sticky mouthfeel, but mostly dry, with a medium amount of carbonation.

A-The Crusher pours a hazy, pale orange. 
S-Instantaneous hop scents rises from the glass. I cannot say I am surprised by its intensity but I am surely impressed. Heavy on the citrus and grapefruit. Pungent grapefruit with some other tropical fruit and lots of pine.
T-About as heavily hopped a beer can taste. A bit more of the tropical fruit here which I like a lot. It still is unabashedly heavy on the citrus. Pine and cut grass. Peach and mango as well.
M-Booze hidden well but it does bring some heat. Resinous and bodacious lay bitter.
O-Yeah, this is one badass liquid. Elite. Hopped to near insane proportions. 649 charactersVelvetExtract, Jul 21, 2014

Pours a cloudy blonde with a two-finger head into my glass. 
Grapefruit with mango on the nose. It's stronger than Heady Topper and yet, doesn't reflect it aroma-wise.
"Hops Up Your Ass". That's how I'd describe the onslaught of grapefruit and mango that hits your mouth in the first sip.
Very dry finish. "Dough-y". 
This one will creep up on you. A sipper, especially in this heat. The hits keep coming for The Kimmichs & Crew (Heady Topper, Focal Banger and now The Crusher!). 628 charactersBrad007, Jul 13, 2014

A: Careful on the pour is pretty well carbonated and pours a nice thick head, leaves lacing all along the glass. Beautiful ambery straw color.
S: Hops, hops, hops, grapefruit, tropical fruitiness, heavily floral hops. All enjoyable.
T: Super flavorful hops on first sip, pretty bitter at first, but seems to mellow as your palate adjusts. Great flavors of grapefruit and those floral notes. I didn't get so much tropical flavors till it warmed up a bit. Great beer.
M: Medium to light bodied, heavy carbonation as mentioned above which I personally enjoy. Light bitterness as it leaves your mouth with a slight alcohol flavor left behind.
O: Amazing beer, unfortunately a limited release now a days, grab it if you can find it. 782 charactersDraksis, May 31, 2014

Love how simple the can is. 
A- Pours a 2 finger white head that dissipates to a messy sticky lacing around the glass. Well carbonated. Nice golden brown color. 
S- Huge hop bomb. Big grapefruit, really nice juicy fruity scents. Mango, peach, really nice floral notes as well. 
T- The taste is amazing! This is a big hob bomb. Nice bitterness upfront, but mellows out as you drink it. Malt is present to balance the hops slightly. Grapefruit bitterness, slight mango, and peach. More prominent in the aroma though. 
M- Medium mouthfeel, dry finish, leaves a nice bitter after taste on your palate. 
O- Really impressed. Not quite Heady, but still pretty amazing. Alchemist knows what there doing when it comes to DIPAS. 769 charactersChriscrundwell12, Apr 25, 2014

Appearance- Hazy yellow/orange with nice lacing around the head.
Smell-Big grapefruit and citrus up front. Lingers into peaches and grapes, and finishes grassy. Super light hint of booze.
Taste- Straight peaches and citrus. Nectraines, pineapple, pears. Finish is lightly piney and grassy. No booze taste, but light heat is there. 
Mouthfeel- Sharp, bubbly carbonation. Pretty full body. Light heat and dry finish.
Overall- Awesome double ipa. Its great but not as drinkable as Heady. Totally different level though. 575 charactersSeanniek91, Mar 30, 2014

The taste is wonderful...perfect balance of bitterness and fruity sweetness. Full bodied silky smooth mouth. The high ABV gives a nice warming down in your core and it begins to explode into your brain by about half way through the can. This is a fantastic delicious fruity hoppy IPA.

Poured into HFS stemware. 
A: Bright white head atop a hazy straw hued body
S: An interplay of sweet malt, citrus (grapefruit?), resin, and tropical fruit. Floored by the aroma.
T: Lots of fruit; heavy citrus character. Lots of sweetness. Abrassive, albeit balancing bitterness. Again, floored. 
M: Soft. Medium light body accompanied with soft carbonation. 
O: 1) I would take this over Heady Topper any day; 2) upon drinking, I thought: this is what the child of Susan and Abner (Hill Farmstead) would taste like; 3) easily one of, (if not) the best hoppy beers I've had the pleasure of trying. Someone tell me Pliny the Younger is better than this, and balance the logic to the small universe of craft beer; for right now, I would argue that this is the pinnacle of Imperial IPA's in the country. 831 charactersxenjoiii, Mar 12, 2014

Was skeptical that it would live up to being as good or better than my favorite Heady but wasn't disappointed. I am at a 5 on both and it would be a tossup on which to buy cases of if they were both readily available. Simple answer is I'd buy a case of each.
Crusher has a very similar piney, floral, intensely hopped aroma and taste in a not overly bitter type of way. A bit less garlicky or oniony than heady on the taste and slightly more citrus to it. The feel is creamy and extremely drinkable. 532 charactersalaimoa, Mar 11, 2014

Appears a nice hazy blonde IPA in my glass with minimal head that quickly dissipates.
Smell was a bit on the weak side for my nose. I did get hoppy notes but I struggled to pick up much aroma (note...my wife seemed to get plenty of hoppy aroma, so maybe it was just me).
Taste was a whole lot of hoppy bitterness upfront, some citrus acidity and delicious hop flavor. It finishes with come citrus sweetness and some bitterness on my tongue with the aftertaste. Alcohol is present.
Mouthfeel is similar to Heady.
Overall, this is an intensely flavored beer. Not entirely unlike Ouroboros, but with much less orange. John is right, this is a strong beer and it does sneak up on you. 744 charactersBoldRulerVT, Mar 10, 2014

Appearance is light orange/straw - similar to Heady. Aroma is what gets this one going - like Heady, popping that can is like opening a bag of fresh hops. Wow - huge pine, lemon, pepper, and herbal notes. Taste - nice balance as expected from the alchemist. Malt backbone is solid, perhaps more noticeable than Heady. Hops are very piney and grassy, to me. Conan yeast is not subtle here. Alcohol is well hidden for 9.6%. Hops drag on the tongue after swallowing. 
Great DIPA but personally, I'm still hooked on Heady. Nice to seek out and try. Beelzebub was the better of the 2 releases, though. 717 charactersCrookdrain, Mar 10, 2014

4.93/5  rDev +9.8%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Drank 1/2 from HF balloon glass, 1/2 from the can.
A: Pours a hazy orange, minimal head. Looks similar to Heady/Focal
S: Hops, lots of hops. Some citrus, some pine, some I can't describe.
T: Holy hops. Taste follows the nose. The first sip tasted very, very bitter, but after that it seemed to balance out and was straight hop deliciousness. Somehow very bitter but also balanced.
M: Mouthfeel similar to other Alchemist IPAs. Good carbonation and very drinkable. I am guessing it is conan yeast like Heady/Focal, but it doesn't come through like it does in those two.
O: I wasn't sure how I'd like it given the description. I didn't know if it would be super bitter or a little boozy/sweet due to the ABV. Its neither. While very bitter, especially initially, I actually find it quite balanced. It doesn't taste like Heady at all to me, which is neither good nor bad, but I found Focal (which I love) to taste very similar to Heady, so the fact that this doesn't is a nice surprise.
UPDATED: After working my way through my remaining cans of this, I feel this might just be my favorite DIPA ever. It is perfect to me. 1,124 charactersbahnfire, Mar 08, 2014
