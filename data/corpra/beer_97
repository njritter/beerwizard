L: Completely opaque black, three fourths of a finger width beige head recedes after a short time but leaves a good ring.  
S: Espresso beans, with coffee, cocoa, some faint vanilla and the chili peppers bringing up the rear and nicely not overpowering.  
T: Nice roasted flavor of coffee and espresso, good vanilla note in the middle ground that blends nicely into some milk chocolate flavors.  The chili peppers are subtle enough to allow the other flavors to shine while maintaining a low amount of heat.  Well done.  
F: Medium body, lower carbonation, smooth and creamy.  
O: An outstanding Imperial Stout and an excellent beer.  Only thing that might make this tastier is a little BBA. 784 charactersRed5StandingBy, Jun 16, 2017

Head does not last very long, but tries to cling to the side of the glass. Smells of sweet expresso mixed with a dark coffee aroma,  I also smell some spice which must be the peppers. Taste is extremely smooth, the cocoa as well as the strong dark malt is found quickly, the vanilla is clearly not an adjuct, but a serious ingredient. Everything seems to be blended excellently together engulfing the booziness into one of the last things that I notice.The peppers come off my breath slowly with ever sip. Very well done stout! 612 charactersLtdsaint, Jun 08, 2017

He held it in high regards so I figured it was worth a try. Looks dark with little head when poured. Smells like a typical breakfast stout. Great smell. Taste is thick! Chocolate notes all around, but still subtle. Prefer the taste of Founders Breakfast Stout but it is not near as strong as bomb.   Smooth as could be for 13% .. All around great beer.  Will try again. 448 charactersMrnickatnite, Jun 07, 2017

4.84/5  rDev +8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75The appearance was a jet black color with a one finger white foamy head that dies immediately. Nice adequate slightly foamy lacing trying to cling to the glass, but spider webs for the most part. The smell had an espresso up front in a nice roasty sort of way backed up by some sweet milk chocolate and with a decent vanilla bean setting pervading my nose. The taste was mainly sweet that ends up leading to a decent balanced roasty sort of effect of a coffee grounds taste but not too bitter or bland as its spectacular and inviting. The aftertaste is basically a combined chocolatey/coffee flavoring with a quick dry finish. On the palate, well this one sits about a medium on the body that makes me want to sip this the more I taste it. Carbonation is good for the style as its fairly smooth and balanced to lead my mouth and tongue into a delicate sticky sweetness. Overall, though I don’t get the "peppery hotness" others do, I say, this is a pretty good brew well worthy of coming back. 994 charactersLone_Freighter, Jun 05, 2017

13%ABV
Pours pitch black in color with a dark beige, one finger head that reduces to a ring around the glass and a thin cap of film. The head has very little retention as it reduces to nothing as you drink and leaves behind very little lacing.
The aroma features bold coffee, vanilla beans, alcohol, chocolate, and Chile pepper spice.
As it warms the chocolate smell becomes stronger and the aroma is dominated by chocolate and coffee.
The taste features coffee and alcohol heat up front, followed by chocolate, roasted dark malts, and slight heat from the chile peppers. The finish is sweet vanilla. Alcohol is noticable and warming as you drink. The myriad flavors are well balanced.
Mouth feel is smooth as silk, full bodied and thick. Very nice.
Overall: Wow! I love stouts brewed in the "Mexican hot chocolate" style and this one is near perfect. It's well balanced, smooth, and oh so tasty! 936 charactersMaestro0708, Apr 10, 2017

Slight heat throughout and lingering afterwards. Good, solid feeling brew. Overall, very nice. At first I thought Stone Xocoveza with the smell so I was a bit thrown with the flavor.

Coffee, cocoa, vanilla beans + Ancho chilis
Roughly 6 months on this one. Calibrated first with a thoroughly decent high proof Mexi-stout, Tempest Mexicake, so there’s no, “Oh, it’s strong and flavor!” love-at-first-sight things going on. And friends, that was wise, because Tempest is brandy and this is cognac. 
Nose is deep, savoury, and ominous, like expensive cologne. Black malt character is far more complex, and the adjuncts deployed with much more finesse, and the chili is implied as much as tated. Cinnamon is missing + coffee added, so not a strict rendering of Mexican hot chocolate. This crucially tones down the whole spice angle, and the vanilla plays like it’s in, say, a creme brulee: you’d miss it if it were gone, but it’s not featured. Cocoa the same, only more so: I can’t even parse it from the dark malts. Roast, wisely, is quiet. Somehow manages to be smoother + less hot than Tempest in spite of 2% higher ABV (though age could’ve helped.) “This is about as far from overbearing and syrupy as an imperial stout can get,” says Kojevergas, and he’s not wrong. 
Ultimately, I don’t even need to know that it’s a concept beer: stands very much on its own. Pairs well with banana bread. Totally get $10 a bottle, and given that I paid $6 for Mexicake, it might even be good a deal.

4.53/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Bought a bottle at the Beer Shop in East Longmeadow, MA. The beer pours with a black appearance and a brown color head that quickly dissipates to form some patchy lacing on the sides. Aromas are very rich. They include the coffee notes mixed with what appeared to be mocha, malt, vanilla, some woody tones, and a peppery spice. The taste follows the nose with a medium boozy taste, almost like a vanilla rum flavor mixed with dark, black coffee. The beer is very creamy, which helps to give the flavors an alcohol warmth and dessert-feel. Overall, an incredible aroma characteristic makes way for other great variables, like taste and mouthfeel. 645 charactersfitzy84, Apr 02, 2017

Chocolate, spices, cinnamon, hints of vanilla and coffee..
Kind of unusual for a stout of this ABV - lots of the aforementioned very lighter nuanced  flavors.
Mouthfeel is light, ABV does not taste anywhere close to 13%, perhaps it's the peppers? Peppers hit you mostly in the finish.

Look- Almost a solid black with half a finger of foamy dark head. Started with some lacing but fades as the drink went down. 
Smell- Lots of coffee with a hint of chocolate coming through. I am not a coffee person and it was too much for me. If you like coffee, I am certain you will rate this higher. 
Taste- Lots more chocolate than I expected. The coffee was still there but not like I expected. The chocolate really gave it a nice sweet taste seemed like more than enough for this style. The real kicker was the chili pepper finish. Spicy is awesome.
Mouthfeel- Definitely a thick brew with a nice dry sort of finish. 
Overall- I was looking for a nice strong beer on a cold night. Just sipped on this forever and the high ABV started to kick in. The peppers really set this one aside with the blended chocolate flavors. Great stout. 903 charactersKdouble, Mar 12, 2017

It tastes like it smells, and I mean that in the best way. I get a little coffee but chocolate, vanilla and the chili peppers (which make this beer stand out from the rest) take the main seat. Wasn't sure how i felt about the chili peppers, but as this beer warmed up, I found that it shined. 
In an age where BA Bourbon stouts seem to be king, the lack of bourbon is kind of refreshing. I appreciate it in the same way I appreciate Double shot. Be careful though, this beer does not taste like a 13%. 
It's amazing that such a great beer is this easily accessible. 778 charactersJrodsmrs51, Mar 10, 2017

Smell- A soft vanilla smell that doesn't really stick to my nose.  There is also a subtle hint of alcohol behind the initial smells.
Taste- More coffee that replaces the vanilla as the primary taste and the vanilla covers up over the smell of alcohol.
Feeling- A noticeable kick from the alcohol content in this and there is a little bit of carbonation with only a little tickle to it.
Overall- Very highly rated drink in my opinion. 559 charactersh0wdy, Mar 04, 2017
3.93/5  rDev -12.3%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Appropriate color, very thin head & lacing. Aroma is a fairly pleasant mixture of mild coffee, semi-bitter cacao and chille pepper, though the pepper begins to dominate as it opens up which was disappointing after the initial quaff.  Touch of medium South American coffee upfront with some verdant pepper underneath (though less noticeable than on the nose). Mid-palate really shifts more towards the semi-bitter chocolate though the vanilla helps masks it a little & leaves more of a residual milk chocolate. Coffee and pepper are still there but nicely joined with the other flavors, and the coffee pokes in at the end with a bitter wash. None of the flavors are too bombastic, and while I am not a pepper-in-beer guy this one is pretty tastey. 746 charactersajm5108, Mar 03, 2017

The smell gives off a weird peppery Italian food scent, so I guess the red peppers come through strong.  The flavor is vanilla, milk chocolate, and just a hint of chili, less strong than the smell implies.  Also, it's crazy smooth for 13% abv.  It's peculiar but tasty.  I won't go out of my way for it, but I'll happily give it another shake. 447 charactersjmasher85, Mar 02, 2017

Served in a Prairie snifter
2015
This beer pours black and is topped with an inch of mocha head that leaves no lacing.
I smell coffee right off the bat. As I stuck my nose in for further discovery I could smell some chili peppers. I smell some chocolate too.
Now the taste is more coffee and chocolate with the peppers in the background. The vanilla adds a little sweetness.
Full mouthfeel with low carbonation
This is a delicious beer. It is one of the rare beers that lives up to the hype. I don't recommend holding on to it for over a year though. 572 charactersbuschbeer, Feb 28, 2017
4.48/5  rDev 0%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pour from single bottle into a tulip.
Pours a nearly-black and opaque (not kind of opaque--inky opaque) with a surprisingly good foamy root-beer colored head and outstanding sticky lacing.
Aromas of bitter coffee and chocolate very forward, with notes of smoke, spice, vanilla, and a hint of pepper
The taste follows the nose quite well, and is fantastic.  However, the roasted malts are very forward, and the brew is dangerously close to being too sweet.  There is just enough carbonation, booziness, and pepper heat to balance it out.
This is a fairly full-bodied brew, with a nice dry finish.
Overall, this is well worth the ratings it's received, and I would recommend to anyone that wants to foray into the Mexican chocolate beer market. 747 charactersMindcrime1000, Feb 26, 2017
4.1/5  rDev -8.5%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4.25Pours black. Quarter finger of head
Vanilla,cherries, chocolate, tobacco, leather on the nose. Smoky malt. Some alcohol.
Chocolate forward.  A little fruitiness in the middle - like aged dried cherries. Vanilla bean on the back end. Some heat from the chillies quickly followed by the burn from the alcohol. Considering its 13 percent alcohol well hidden. But I can feel it heating my chest and stomach.
I like this beer, but feel it's overrated.  Definitely a 9 beer.  But not as perfect as the aggregate score indicates. 525 charactersmaxdeusphallis, Feb 26, 2017

Beer poured blacked with a nice tan head that is leaving some lacing.
Nose is roasted chilies, vanilla, coffee, and chocolate.
Initial taste was a medium dose of hot chilies on the back of the throat.  Subsequent sips reveal vanilla coffee with a hint of chocolate finishing with the chili warmth.
Mouthfeel was medium to full bodied and smooth.
Overall a very tasty brew that is definitely worth seeking out! 519 charactersarizcards, Feb 25, 2017

Pours black with a fluffy tan head that falls leaving great retention and sticky lacing. The aromas are very nice. Lots of milk chocolate with some hints of vanilla cream. Subtle hints of caramel. Cocoa malts are there. The coffee aromas are subtle. The flavors are very bold and rich. Lots of rich milk chocolate. The coffee becomes more alive in the flavor department. It finishes with a nice spice kick due to the chili peppers. Hints of vanilla in the mix. Solid cocoa malt backbone. It finishes slightly warm, mostly due to the peppers, but the alcohol is well hidden. It's dangerously drinkable. Mouthfeel is very nice. It's full-bodied with moderate carbonation. It's velvety and creamy without being super thick. Very smooth and fun to drink. Once again, this is dangerously drinkable. It doesn't drink like it's 13% abv at all.
This is a great imperial stout. Great aromas and flavors. All of the adjuncts blend well together. The craftsmanship is very impressive. It's a little pricey, but it's really good. 1,051 charactersBB1313, Feb 19, 2017

Nose is roast, bitter cocoa, and a hint of chili. A vanilla sheen overlaps as well. 
Cocoa roast, unbelievably smooth thanks to vanilla. Chili and cocoa bitterness linger on the end, with creamier chocolate notes. 
Smooth as a silky viscous stout could be. A peppery finish suggests the chili, and leaves its heat in the back of the throat. 
Probably the most celebrated craft beer from the Sooner State, and quite worthy of its praise. Bomb! is a stout's stout. 620 charactersDinglehacker, Feb 14, 2017

4.46/5  rDev -0.4%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5BOMB! is a slightly viscous, effervescent, near-impenetrably black beer that shows mahogany footlights and a thin, rocky tan head that leaves scant, fast-retreating blotches of lacing. The nose is medium-large: a tasty blend of molasses, cocoa and black coffee with more subtle baker's chocolate, hints of exotic spice, and insistent alcohol overtones with a faint solvent-like fusel character. The flavor is a seamless blend of molasses, dark caramel and milk chocolate, with more subtle cocoa notes and hints of a cayenne-like vegetal character; all of this is undercut by a significant boozy undertow. Overall, it lands just about on the balance point in terms of sweet vs. bitter. The finish is a good hit of molasses and alcohol, followed by the onset of a mild, boozy chocolate-and-coffee flavor and a modest capsaicin burn, both of which last for a good while. Retrogustative olfaction is decidedly boozy. Mouthfeel is commensurate with the extra-full body, and is warming from both the alcohol and the capsaicin; the texture is sticky/creamy and slightly peppery from the well-expressed carbonation.

Mocha brown/black with a cappuccino brown head. On point for the style. Sparse but intricate lacing. Weaker head which disappears after a couple minutes. Minimal lacing.
Taste: Roasted malts with chocolate, coffee, some nice vanilla beans and almost undetectable chili peppers. 
I cannot BELIEVE this mofo has 13% in it. I've tasted beers half as strong with more bitterness. Absolutely none at all. This beer could get you in trouble bahaha. Every sip is full of love. Licorice? GODLY beer here.
The feel is extremely full bodied, washing down smooth and easy. Just a little dry but leaves the palate wet and panting for more. Malts are the most balanced and rewarding I've had in the style. This is the highest retad beer I have on here for a reason.
Damn I love this beer and you will too. Price is high but the quality is THERE 
Cheers. This beer makes my mouth water. At a month old (warning their bottle date is extremely hard to read) and I don't even know if they're using Julian dating but I know it's about a month old. Fucking awesome beer. 1,131 charactersHotDogBikeRide, Feb 06, 2017

4.05/5  rDev -9.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25This one po9urts a dark brown that is so impenetrable to light it appears black.  The head is a thin, short lived tan affair that leaves zero lacing.
The nose is sweet maltiness alcohol, coriander, nutmeg, vanilla, apples, cinnamon, chocolate and coffee with hints of over ripe dark cherries.
The taste is a competing sweet malt with dryness, they battle for dominance. the sweet quickly fades leaving a dryer stout that is mixing it up with alcohol, raisins, chocolate, apricots that fall off to a fairly clean finish.
The mouthfeel is rich and heavy as expected for the style.
Overall a very pleasant stout, just a bit pricey when there are others that are equal or better. I recommend at least trying it. 711 charactersAtrumAnimus, Feb 04, 2017

S - Very interesting. Dark chocolate, medium coffee, chili pepper.
T - Taste almost identical to the smell. First chocolate, then notes of med roast coffee, then a chili pepper kick on the back end, I couldn't pick up the vanilla.
F - Smooth and chewy. It was drinkable but it didn't feel like a beer. 
O - I'll note that I am probably one of the few people who really don't like porters / stouts. Having said that, I wasn't completely turned off by this and I think the brewer did a nice job with incorporating the different flavor profiles. It just didn't drink like a beer for me and I am not sure if I would try again. 675 charactersQnola1111, Feb 02, 2017

Smell is mostly cacao with just a hint of chili and booze.
Taste is much more complex than the smell. Getting all kinds of vanilla,carmel sugary goodness then a bit of big chili flavor hits mid palate with a nice dark bakers chocolate type finish .
Feel is full bodied but certainly not thick or oily like you get with a lot of imperial stouts, still very silky tho.
Overall this is a damn good beer I will drink again at some point but maybe a little high on price . 533 charactersTerryMills, Jan 31, 2017

O: A well-done beer. The smell was off the charts for me, the taste wasn't to far off but the body to me wasn't the smoothest. Would have perfered a little less carb. It reminded me a lot of Stone's Xocoveza. If you gave me the body of Xocoveza with the taste from BOMB! I would have given it a perfect score. The other thing I got to factor in is the price. I can get a 6 pack of Xocoveza for around $15 and a 12oz of BOMB! runs me $11. Still very glad I tried this guy though but probably won't buy it again. 858 characterschicagobeerguy, Jan 24, 2017

The ancho peppers, in particular, take it to another level. As is, it fits the same character of a lot of great stouts, just done very well: roasted malts, vanilla, chocolate, check. The residual heat and slight vegetable flavor from the anchos, though, just really add a ton. Well deserving of its reputation. 396 charactersHiram_McDaniels, Jan 22, 2017

Pours jet black with an inch of beautiful, stable, brownish head that dissipated slowly and left plenty of lacing and foam on the sides of the glass. Beautiful in the glass. Smell is of coffee, then chocolate, mocha, and oatmeal. only complaint on the nose, is I pick up the slightest metallic smell. Taste is spot on! Same qualities you pick up in the nose, minus the metallic hint, and all more pronounced, with the full pat body carrying everything through and creating a full palate of very.. well, breakfasts flavors! Cold brew, mocha, bittersweet cocoa, a touch of caramel sweetness, and a full mouthfeel. 698 charactersBigtexasG, Jan 21, 2017

Incredible strong roasted coffee aroma along with Cocoa and chocolate.
The aromas blend and intensify with warming.
Good bitterness and the chili comes through subtly but it doesn't overwhelm the
balance of the beer.
Taste is phenomenal. One of the better imperial stouts. Unquestionably loaded with roasted
coffee, chocolate and cacao flavor. An overtone of spice,
One of the better imperial stouts out there and in the top class.
BCBS is more layered and a different approach- this beer is on the spicy heavy roasted coffee end.

Pouring a jet black with a dense, dark brown head with excellent retention and lacing, this looks great! The nose is quite excellent. Very clearly a coffee-forward imperial stout, though the addition of the chili peppers, which add a heat and flavor that bring to mind green peppercorns, The coffee character is rather fruity with dark roast. There's a rich malt flavor with cocoa, roast and the vanilla pairs nicely with the rest of the nose. The cacao nibs are whelmed by the coffee and the pepper, so their distinctive flavor is slightly lost here. Still, this is impressive. The palate opens with a blend of caramel sweetness, a touch of dulce de leche, plenty of coffee and cacao before a mild heat becomes noticeable. Fruity coffee with green peppercorns, mildly vegetal, with this character growing towards the finish. Sweet on the finish with vanilla and caramel with cocoa and coffee. The pepper character is mildly smoky as well. Alcohol is well hidden in this full bodied beer that's softly carbonated and quite wonderfully creamy on the palate. The pairing of the sweeter, more malt and milk chocolate like flavors up front with the darker roast and coffee on the mid-palate is intriguing. 
This beer is almost fantastic - the flavor notes are there, the integration is almost there and the vision is clear. Highly recommended. 1,385 charactersDefenCorps, Jan 16, 2017

S - Huge nose of alcohol, big roast with nut and wood, a bit of pepper warmth, chocolate, brownie.  Yum.
T - Open is chocolate and full, a quick drop to the middle with a sharp bitter bite, and a slow pepper warmth in the close.
M - Amazing feel, moderate and slick, so much easier than most beers at this ABV.  This is the real stand-out characteristic.
O - I cannot say I love pepper infused stouts.  But this is one well built version, with a great flavor open, and a feel that makes this a real treat to drink. 658 charactersTsar_Riga, Jan 14, 2017

Pours thick as oil with that ominous appearance big stouts seem to carry. 
Nose is coffee, toffee, molasses, and that vanilla/oak character. No noticeable chili presence at first pass
Slight chili heat on the palate, especially the finish as it warms up. More molasses and coffee than I expected and certainly some vanilla. Pretty damn balanced with that subtle hop bitterness. Booze as it warms
Wow this is smooth! Definitely not expecting such a perfect feel to this given the ABV and nose
Overall, very smooth for a high ABV beer. Would definitely seek out again

Reviewed as: American Double / Imperial Stout
Misc.: N/A
Went to this place with the intention of trying and reviewing two barrel-aged stouts. This was after eight 4-oz. tasters each at Craft Haus and Bad Beat. Decided on Even More Jesus and Bomb! over a Russian Imperial Stout from Joseph James. Was looking forward to finally trying this one. Would be disappointed with anything below a 4.30.
Poured a pitch black color with two fingers of frothy tan head.  Excellent spiderweb lacing. Good retention. (Sight - 4.25)
Smelled chile peppers, dark roasted chocolate, dark cocoa, vanilla and some hints of coffee. (Smell - 4.25)
Tasted milk chocolate, chocolate syrup, cocoa, vanilla, caramel, spices coming in late and brownie batter. (Taste - 4.50)
Full body. Creamy texture. Average carbonation. Long, slightly spicy warming finish. (Feel - 4.75)
This was about as good as I could have hoped. Glad I got to try it and can’t wait to have it again. (Overall - 4.50)

Poured from the bottle into a glass.
Black/brown appearance. 
A rough pour yielded a small tan head which quickly dissipated; minimal lace. 
Dark chocolate, roasted coffee bean, sweet cream & faint raspberry notes in the nose. 
Thick, creamy mouthfeel. 
Dark chocolate, roasted coffee bean & sweet cream flavors up front; a hint of smoke & VERY faint pepper heat notes on the finish. No booze heat. A delicious, rich, dangerously drinkable treat. Bravo! 510 charactersGuyFawkes, Dec 23, 2016

It pours dark with a dark tan head it smells and taste like coffee and dark chocolate and is very smooth. Mouth feel is nice not to thick or carbonated. It is a tad expensive I paid $6.99 for one bottle but my curiosity had got the best of me. 327 charactersMinerBob, Dec 23, 2016
4.52/5  rDev +0.9%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5On-tap served in a pint glass at O’glee, Bangkok.
It comes black as night in color with one finger of frothy tan head that stands with pretty decent retention before gradually sinking to some bubble on the surface, lots of lacing patch and spot left on the glass-side.
Very intense espresso coffee, cocoa, chocolate, vanilla and sweet caramel aromas as well as some roasted and bready notes. Those scents are nicely infused with a chili spice and hint of cherry and alcohol to create a very inviting aroma.
The taste follows the aroma but has a little bit astringency while mostly it is rich yet intense coffee and chocolate, chili spice and warming alcohol.
Bold and full body with a bit sticky mouthfeel through the palate, anyway, it is crisp and lively enough to carry all the things well with a dry finish.
Superb Stout with solid coffee, cocoa, and chocolate profile, its alcohol content will make you feel the heat as well as chili, complex and hefty but truly great. 981 charactersEverydayoff, Dec 21, 2016

4.58/5  rDev +2.2%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Pours a brown so deep that it appears to be shoe polish black. The pour produces barely half a finger of frothy, very shortlived, deep mocha head that leaves only a hint of a collar ring & no lace. A very mundane look for such an otherwise outstanding brew. Aroma is deeply roasted malts, dark chocolate, chili pepper, caramel, toffee, coffee, alcohol booze & a hint of smoke. Taste is deeply roasted coffee, cold & spent coffee grounds, burnt dark malts, spicy chili pepper (ancho?), dark chocolate syrup, alcohol booze & smoke with hints of dark fruit. Fronted by chili pepper spice, dark roast/burnt malts, semi-sweet dark cocoa & smoke mingling & riding into the prickly finish where they are joined by dark fruit transitioning into an earthy, coffee, chocolate, slightly bitter, & pepper prickly burnt aftertaste. Alcohol is evident in warmth, flavor & maybe bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium-heavy bodied with weak carbonation, the pepper spice pricklinesscould be confused for carbonation bite that manifests as a crawling spicy, prickly bite, tongue coating creamy & chewy. As is usual with many such brews this one improves in flavor as it warms. It is certainly a top end example of an imperial Stout chili beer. Well done! 1,231 charactersmothmanscott, Dec 16, 2016

F- It's fine. Smooth with a decent richness. Not very thick though.
O- Probably one of the best stouts that's regularly on the shelf. Admittedly the price ($10 for 12 oz) is a good chunk of the reason. Would like it a lot more with a thicker feel and/or a $20 four pack. 506 charactersZoomslowik, Dec 14, 2016

4.83/5  rDev +7.8%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5L: Pitch black with a foamy, brown head that dissipated pretty quickly, as expected, but leaves a thin ring that leaves splotchy tan lacing.
S: Dark roast coffee, like espresso, most prominent, with a massive backbone of bittersweet dark chocolate that compliments the roast of the coffee.  The spices are subtle, but faint hints of chili pepper and cinnamon are there in the background to tingle the nostrils.  
T: Upfront, it tastes like mocha as the coffee, chocolate, and vanilla beans meld together for rich, creamy experience.  As it moves on to the middle of your tongue, the chocolate and coffee express themselves fully, a rich, bittersweet dark chocolate compliment by the roastiness of the espresso and coffee that cuts through the chocolaty sweetness.  On the back of the palate, the vanilla beans come back, smoothing things out.  Then on the finish, you're hit with the cinnamon and chili peppers, but they are not overpowering.  There is some alcohol warmth, but it very well hidden for 13%, and the heat melds with the cinnamon and chili peppers for a warming sensation.  Finishes cleaner than expected, with a slightly bitter cacao aftertaste and tingling hints of the cinnamon and chili peppers, begging for the next sip.
F: Not super thick or chewy, but a medium-full bready feeling.  It glides easily across the palate, with just enough slickness to coat the mouth with all the flavors.
O: This is the best Mexican hot chocolate-inspired stout I've had thus far.  The spices are more subtle, which is my personal preference, and they serve simply to compliment the rest of the stout.  However, the coffee and cacao nibs are phenomenal in this one, and I love me some coffee in beer.  The sheer drinkability is insane.  This is a world-class beer. 1,770 charactersHorseheadsHopHead, Dec 06, 2016

Look: it looks like a stout (deal with it!)
Smell:
Chocolate and coffee is the first smell. Interestingly i do not smell the 13% booziness. PAT yourself on your backs for that. If that was what u all were going for, you did it. Don't smell the pepper like the stone's  Xocoveza. 
Taste: in my selfish humble opinion...OFF The HOOK !
On taste  i get the coffe chocolate and pepper. Interestingly the pepper smell did not come out but on the taste it did but not strong, it arrives as a blend with the coffee and chocolate. 
Feel: as all my reviews the feel is private and personal, go away (LOL!)
Overall: I want another one! I think that says it all, i want another one.
OK OK..in my humble opinion, this beats stone's  Xocoveza. 
Sorry stone. But this is my subjective palate.

this smells like peppers and coffee, very interesting. smells like coffee with hot sauce yet is sweet.
this beer has a great full flavor. tons of chocolate, coffee, and even pepper. a soft and mellow hotness comes thru but the coffee/chocolate shines through. this is a hell of a beer, especially because it's 13%. goes down so smooth for such a big beer. the only beer that resembles this is Stone Xocoveza but this is still different than that.
velvety smooth, to put this beer VERY simply. Imperial Stout + Frank's Red Hot + Coffee 592 charactersWiffler27, Nov 30, 2016

The liquid itself appears to be as thick as I've ever seen, having motor oil like qualities in color and appearance. A moderate sized head dissipates quickly, leaving nothing but a small ring of lacing around the edge.
Oh my, the aroma. Deep, vivid chocolate and burnt coffee malts. Very strong.
Smooth, bitter, and a bit of a bite. Very complex flavor. Cacao nibs and hints of vanilla are mostly there, but it's dominated by the same notes from the aroma of a blend of dark and milk chocolate. I'm getting some notes of dark fruits on the back end. The finish is sweet and bitter, some might consider it overly-so and possibly harsh. I think it's a beautiful touch to a wonderful winter brew.
As drinkable as it gets at 13% ABV. Sweet, but not too much warmth or bite from the alcohol.
Overall, an excellent winter beer worthy of all the praise it received. I can see some people disliking it's sweetness,but it works for me. Would really like to try aging this one. 1,071 charactersmajorbase2, Nov 27, 2016
3.45/5  rDev -23%look: 4.75 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 3.25Pours super thick and dark, tiny little twister of bubbles at the end. Took for ever for this to warm up in my room. I drank more of it than I should of before it reached optimal temp. DEF want this to warm up to get the full taste. On the nose I'm blasted with coffee and chocolate. It kind of reminds me of smelling a flavored dunkin donuts or starbucks drink. Tasting it, you get rich bold flavor, but it's extremely sweet. lots of coacoa, vanilla sweetness, don't really get too much of a kick from the peppers. This beer is pretty yummy, but it sort of feels some where in between drinking a syrup'd out starbucks latte and drinking the most choclatey bottom of a milk-shake. Althought packed with rich flavors, something about the overt-candy rush vibe of this beer doesn't feel right. It's like some hipster donut in beer form.
note: this is the 2016 batch that just came out, maybe next time I get a chance to grab a bottle I will try to wait a couple years before trying it. 984 charactersREIFICATION, Nov 26, 2016

Aggressive pour led to a 1 finger dark khaki,and dark brown mottled head,with large to medium bubbles.Very light carbonation.Jet black in color,with absolutely no light coming through the glass.The head leaves a nice looking ring around the glass,with a spider web lacing in the center.Eventually that dissipates into nothing.Sipping leaves a beautiful lacing on the side of the glass.
The nose is chocolate,coffee,cocoa,and a little bit of peppers,ending with slight alcohol aromas.I also get  little bit of earthy roasted malts,along with some slight hints of vanilla.
The palate follows the nose with strong black coffee,cocoa,some dark chocolate,and dark roasted malt.You get a little bit of pepper,but nothing offensive to me.I think the slight hint of peppers on the back end,does a beautiful job of hiding the alcohol.You also get a nice warming alcohol feel on the finish,which makes it a good beer for drinking in the cold.
The body is medium,but slightly sticky.You get a slight tingling sensation of peppers,and alcohol on the way down.Medium dry finish.
This is a very good imperial stout.The flavors are very well balanced,and the pepper does an excellent job of masking the alcohol...Looks,smells,tastes,and feels GREAT!!! This is in my top 3 favorite imperial stouts...Excellent brew!!!! 1,370 charactersDraconusDesanctus666, Nov 25, 2016

This is loaded with the aroma of peppers and taste of peppers but sadly there is zero heat. I can't decide if I don't like it or if it's straight up a gross mix of a salad and a beer.
Addendum - halfway through it became obnoxious sweet and difficult to considered drain pouring. However since I'm a fan a real pepper beers I added a habernero hot sauce I have before added to sub par IPA's. Didn't drain pour but will never buy this again. 498 charactersrypkr, Nov 21, 2016

S: Best part of the beer. Tons of vanilla and coffee come through along with dark chocolate, some spice, and sweet booze. 
F: More of the ancho chili peppers come through in the taste. What you would expect from the aroma but the sweet booze takes over a little more than I would like. 
F: Thick and full but almost abrasively warming from the high alcohol. 
O: Very very good but stouts that get into this range of abv can be a little too aggressive for myself. 522 charactershgw605, Nov 11, 2016

Aromas is just incredible. Insane melted chocolate, peppers, vanilla, cherry, amaretto, coffee, lactose.
Flavor is more of the same but chili forward yet amazingly not overdone. Coffee and chocolate pop up in between bites of chili. A firm, roasty finish takes place.
Feel is slick and semi thick but not as thick as id like. Only let down here.
Overall, what a great beer. Now I know what I was missing. 439 charactersThe-Adjunct-Hippie, Nov 06, 2016
4.25/5  rDev -5.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Very good but compares unfavorably to Stone Xocoveza IMO. They do a good job with all of the Mexican chocolate type flavors, chocolate cinnamon and chilI. But it's rougher and harsher and the 13% abv is obvious. I caught a slight cigarette taste and Aroma as well. Letting it warm up for 10 minutes really ups the quality. At ten bucks a bottle I won't be going for this any time the Stone or Cigar City Mexican choc beers are in circulation. 442 charactersjaketaz, Nov 05, 2016

Smell - semi sweet chocolate, coffee, toffee, hints of vanilla bean ice cream. Basically when starbucks grows up, this is the cologne/perfume it will wear
Taste - all of thee above plus hints of black pepper and serrano on the back on the tongue during the finish. Tiny bit of earthy hops midway through, but barely noticeable. Mainly sweet dark charred notes.
Feel - thick and luscious.  Leaves an espresso taste long after the swallow, much like an Americano or a double shot. Alcohol is noticeable but not overpowering.  
Overall - one of the best readily available heavy stouts on the market. Not cheap,  but worth every penny. 12 Oz is the perfect serving. 760 charactersTheHappyGriffin, Nov 04, 2016

4.74/5  rDev +5.8%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Pour: looks black as night, a typical stout. Little to no head. If you're lucky you'll get a bit of tan off the head which will be gone like  a fart in the wind.
Smell: Smells like coffee grounds, earthy soil after a rainstorm, cocoa powder, madagascar vanilla beans, and a touch of cayenne. 
Taste: Mother of god, this caos of a combination humbly harmonizes. Right up front a touch of milk, then roasted toffee, caramel, and vanilla to linger. Most importantly the subtly peppers give you a bit of a palate awakening and invite the next sip.
Body:  The body is almost a bit of a throw off. It's not at all as heavy as the nose and taste would lead you to believe. At times it is watery, like a guinness. Abv is well hidden, almost untraceable.
Overall, this is a fantastic stout. I hope they do not sell out to major corporate beer and produce this for the masses on a commercial scale. This is just perfect. It's not as hard to find as pliny or another hyped up beer, but you will find this occasionally in your local craft store. This should be enjoyed to the rest of the country as a specialty like christmas, and to the locals as their own. Just a wonderful beer. cheers. 1,181 characterssantomark, Oct 31, 2016
4.23/5  rDev -5.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25From a bottle. Solid black with a thin tan head. Smell is light stone fruit. Taste smooth chocolate and coffee, some late ripe stone fruit. Very slight bitterness to balance. Maybe some mild heat from the chilis. Feel is silky slick, low carb, not chewy thick, but in no way thin. Booze is present of course, but would not guess 13%. Overall an excellent beer, but with these big stouts, I always compare to a BBA, and I find the non-aged ones lacking a bit. Also, at $10 per single 12 oz I doubt I will be buying many 518 characters98green, Oct 30, 2016

4.03/5  rDev -10%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 412oz bottle. 9/9/14 production date. Appearance: Black, opaque, with a brown head that dissipates quickly. Aroma: Rich coffee roast, dark chocolate, some dark cherry, grass, pepper, and a touch of cardboard oxidation Taste: Starts with a rich coffee roast and dark chocolate, quickly turning to a moderately strong, grassy, chili pepper that delivers some heat, and a moderately strong bitterness that’s accentuated by the pepper spice. Mouthfeel: Medium to heavy bodied with some syrupy consistency, and low carbonation. Surprising that the alcohol warmth isn’t noticeable considering it’s 13%. Finish: Leaves a chocolate and coffee roast bitterness on the finish, with some lingering chili heat. Overall: If I had to sum this up I’d say it’s a coffee pepper imperial stout. Strong coffee roast character throughout, and the chili pepper adds a significant heat and vegetal/grassy flavor. For an imperial stout of this strength the alcohol isn’t noticeable and the dark fruit character is nonexistent. An interesting beer, but not sure I would buy a 2nd. 1,067 charactersTH28, Oct 30, 2016
4.24/5  rDev -5.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Poured into a tulip
Aroma: tobacco and green olives with a mixture of bittersweet and milk chocolate, cedar and vanilla.
Appearance: black - 10 W30. Head is a light tan with microscopic bubbles that fades quickly to a very long lasting lacing at the edge of the glass. 
Flavor: many layers and flavors, all woven into a beautiful tapestry. No one flavor dominates: the vanilla and coffee combine wonderfully. The chilis are barely detectable and there is only the very mildest of heat, which would probably go unnoticed without the mention of chilis on the label. Very good. 
Mouthfeel: medium, but surprisingly light given the 13% abv. You can easily drink a few of these.
Overall: Very good and worthwhile, but I feel the overall BA score is greater than deserved by this beer. This beer is approaching BCBS' BA score, but BCBS is the much superior imperial stout. Certainly try this beer given the opportunity, though. 926 charactersPray_For_Mojo, Oct 29, 2016

The first sip brought coffee initially, followed by vanilla, milk chocolate, roasted malt, and a sturdy, warming chili spiciness which lingered on the finish. This balanced the heat from the alcohol perfectly. A fantastic beer. 416 charactersBuck89, Oct 29, 2016

4.38/5  rDev -2.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Moderate one finger head which steadily simmers down, dark tan or light brown, take your pick, very even surface, the lacing slides around the glass in broad sheets, eventually spilling downwards. Black liquid yet not so opaque that you can’t see the bubble beads, no color tint at the edges. Spicy nose with the chili pepper making the initial splash, at times almost green and leafy with a wet fur edge, oily tar, the chocolate seems dense enough as to be inert, burnt coffee, close to zero fruit scent presence, quite interesting yet not immediately pleasurable. Full-bodied, viscously thick and layered, here the sweetness of the chocolate and vanilla is on full display, all confectionery goodness. The chili spice there but more proportionate, bringing heat for balance. Coconut, cafe con leche and a hint of witch hazel. Not much movement from the carbonation, just a tickle under the tongue. The pepperiness lingers the most through the finish. Avoids both excess booziness and needless showiness, for its scale and level of richness displays good agility. One bottle is the perfect size for a single sitting. 1,119 charactersfarrago, Oct 06, 2016

But on subsequent sips, I began to appreciate the flavor complexity: smoky sweetness smoothly rolling into a mild bitterness, the subtle spice in the finish, the creamy mouthfeel, and the nearly complete lack of alcoholic taste in an absurd 13% abv.  Very little carbonation, which I like in stouts.  If I want to be picky, I wish there was more head.

Look pours completely black with a nice brown head that settles out and leaves lots of lacing behind. 
Smell is amazing coffee, bourbon, chocolate, vanilla, and just a hint of chili peppers.
Taste is amazingly complex, starts out boozy, settles into a bit of ancho pepper, than finishes with vanilla beans and chocolate. The only better taste is when this is rum barrel aged i.e. Pirate Bomb. 
Mouthfeel is smooth, full, and complex. Let this one sit and warm for a bit - doesn't get much better.

4.3/5  rDev -4%look: 5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 3.5355ml bottle into a Spiegelau Stout glass. Paid £10.75 for a single bottle.
Pours an opaque, inky black body, that when held to the light allows some dark ruby glimmers to be observed near the edges of the glass. A dense and creamy, one-finger in height, light tan coloured head with excellent retention slowly reduces to a thin film and collar, leaving behind small amounts of soapy lace.
The rich and full nose leads initially with a combination of lightly roasted dark malts, sweet toasty grains and milk chocolate. Darker, earthy notes of dry, bitter cocoa powder and hints of smoke, ash and char are noticeable underneath. The finish reveals restrained chilli pepper heat and spice, along with vanilla and traces of fusel alcohol sweetness. Taste roughly follows suit. Lightly roasted dark malts, coffee beans and baking chocolate are sweetened considerably by creamier milk chocolate, roasted grains, vanilla and hints of burnt caramel, Mid palate, ancho chilli peppers enter with a little more presence than the nose suggested. Although moderately hot and spicy, lingering malt sweetness and vanilla soften the edges to deliver a pleasantly smooth and subtle warming profile overall. In the mouth, a medium to full body pairs well with a liberal amount of fine carbonation, present just enough to aid drinkability without effecting the luxuriously rich, smooth and creamy feel. Towards the back-end, espresso, dry earthy roasted dark malts, cocoa, smoke, vanilla, caramelised sugars and chilli spices linger to give a lengthy bittersweet finish. Traces of alcohol and roast combine, drying the palate slightly, while capsaicin oils bring faint and pleasant warmth to the lips, throat and chest.
Overall this is an excellent beer. Rich, flavourful, well balanced and insanely drinkable, despite the substantial 13.0% ABV. Its alcoholic content in fact, is so masterfully disguised, I had to remind myself to slow down and savour the taste after quickly consuming nearly half the glass. As both a beer I’ve wanted to get my hands on for a very long time and a rare find in the UK, the price I paid seems fair enough. Despite meeting expectations however, now that I have tried it, at £10.75 a single, realistically I can’t see myself picking up another unless it was for a very special occasion. 2,309 characters911CROFT, Sep 04, 2016

Look: Completely pitch black, with a thin ring of dark tan lacing present.
Smell: Hot chilies, cocoa, coffee grounds all in the aroma, which has a slight vegital tinge.
Feel: On the heavier side of medium, with mild carbonation. great mouthfeel.
Taste: Spicy chilies bring on head initially on the palate, but soon replaced by sweet coffee, chocolate, and caramel. 
Finishes with a mild spicy/sweet flavor.
Overall: Been wanting to try this for a while now, and finally spotted it at the beer store. I can say it was definitely worth the wait. This is up there with the best; words cannot describe how it is. It combines my favorite styles of chile beer, and stouts. 777 charactersBonkinishwa, Aug 29, 2016

A thin, short-lived head of brown foam rests on top. Huge nose. Definite coffee, peppermint, lactose, spicy chiles, and a touch of vanilla. Smells delicious - one of the best smelling beers I've had in a long time. On the taste, I get a butt load of coffee and chocolate up front with strong backing notes of vanilla and cream. After a second or two, the chiles creep in and make their presence known. Not too strong, but strong enough. The mouthfeel is perfect. Thick, dense, milky, but not overly chewy. This sum'bitch is as balanced as one could hope for.
I've been waiting to try this for a long time and it didn't disappoint. Perfectly balanced, incredibly tasty, and quite unique. Is it worth the price? Not on a regular basis, but it's worth picking up at least once. Great beer. 900 charactersdo_ob, Aug 28, 2016

Mouthfeel is spot on. Not syrupy but still a mouthful.

Smells of deep roasted notes of cocoa and coffee mostly.
Tastes of the deep roasted notes layered with some vanilla.  Malt notes of semi-sweet chocolate, coffee, and molasses lead off with plenty of sweetness.  This gives way to some vanilla notes.  Chilis are more noticable as it warms.  Next comes some earthy hops as well as roasted bitterness.  Finishes with a lingering roasted coffee note.
Mouthfeel is full with a smooth amount of carbonation.
Overall, this is a brilliant Imperial Stout.  I could do without the chilis, but it does fit well. 642 charactersocelot2500, Aug 14, 2016

Poured into a short tulip and enjoyed around a camp fire with s'mores.  Dark like used motor oil with good-sized brown head that sticks around.  Wonderful aroma with muted chocolate, coffee and dark malt.  Taste is also excellent - with just a hint of chili.  Mouthfeel is just how I like big stouts, not too thick and viscous - still a sipper, but easy to finish the whole bottle.  Overall, one of the better stouts I've had.

L: 2F light tan head, no retention as the ABV knocks it right away, leaving a tiny ring and cap. Beer is as dark as can be.
S: Lots of coffee up front, some cocoa, vanilla, caramel malts, and a hint of chili. No alcohol in nose, which at 13% is a heck of an accomplishment.
T: Coffee, cocoa, then vanilla, caramel malt, and then chili at the finish, but just a little bit. The cocoa especially really carries through the entire taste experience from beginning to end. I believe the chili is designed to dovetail nicely with the alcohol heat as you just can't pick it up without the spice. Seriously, there is almost no indication this is an alcoholic beverage (well, until you get through half of it). Most impressive.
F: Medium, and less heavy than you might expect. Very little carbonation to speak of. Very good construction and just immaculate balance in making all this flavor work together.
O: Really amazing stuff. 984 charactersIvoryFoxhole, Jul 31, 2016

There's an almost plum-like quality to the aroma, with coffee and some slight mildly-smokey pepper behind.  
The taste is much more coffee-forward.  Lightly sweet tasting, with a peppery backend.  Medium bodied.
There's a lot going on here.  I will say that the pepper addition is well done, adding some character to the beer and a slight numbing burn to the lips, without overpowering anything in the aroma or taste.  That said, the balance and flavor of the coffee and other additions didn't really impress me in comparison to all the other delicious stouts available these days.  Glad to have tried it, but I won't be looking out for it again. 721 charactersthebeers, Jul 30, 2016

4.33/5  rDev -3.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Reviewed from long-standing notes. Had on-tap at Stein & Vine. Served in a snifter glass.
A: Essentially black and opaque, with no real head to speak of. Minimal if any visible carbonation.
S: Huge on the nose, even when it's cold (as served). Big dark chocolate, bakers chocolate, spicy peppers, coffee. Rich and dank tobacco notes, sweet malts, vanilla, and hints of lactose. Some vegetal sweetness as well. Very, very nice nose.
T: Big chocolate and cacao nibs, spicy peppers, and rich roasted malts. More pipe tobacco. Chocolate covered espresso beans and bits of vanilla. Finishes with both roasted malt and milder hop bitterness after the chocolatey sweetness fades. The spicy pepper presence actually fades a little as it warms through the drink - or perhaps I adjusted to it.
M: Thick sticky body, though not as much of either as Hunahpu. Low carbonation sensation, and the alcohol is incredibly well-hidden here. The beer disappears awfully quickly.
O: This is a very good adjunct stout. The comparisons to Cigar City's Hunahpu are inevitable. I found the Bomb! to have more chocolate presence and less vanilla, as well as not having the thick, glass-staining body. Missing the cinnamon and molasses of Hunahpu. But in its own right, this is a very good beer. And relatively easily obtained in convenient 12 oz. packaging to boot. Not likely to be the best you've ever had, but you owe it to yourself to try it. 1,425 charactersmacrosmatic, Jul 17, 2016

Taste is a blast of waffles covered in maple syrup, followed by gustatory incarnations of the scent. A warm scintilla of booze and chilli pepper linger on the tongue... alcohol is well hidden for a 13 percenter. Mouth feel is a bit thinner than the flavor might suggest, but leaves nothing to be desired. One of the best stouts I've ever had, barrel-aged or not. 489 charactersAmgineDanus, Jul 16, 2016

Smell is phenomenal, heavy with the smell of dried fruits, chilis, chocolate liqueur, which reminds me of eating the fruit filled See's candies. Sweet chocolate is the first flavor that hits your pallet, followed by a slight red wine booziness, ending with bitter coffee and the slightest smokey heat of chipotle chili peppers that builds with every drink. All in all a very tasty and interesting beer that deserves a go. 502 charactersDraftyBrew, Jul 04, 2016
4.29/5  rDev -4.2%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Had from the bottle
A - Black, opaque, minimal head. 
S - Cinnamon, spice, chilies and some coffee. 
T - follows the nose, the flavors come together very nicely. Chilies take a bit of a backseat to the rest of the adjuncts, finishing with a slight warming heat. 
M - Medium to full bodied, moderate carb.
O - This is a great beer to be able to find on shelves fairly regularly. Extremely enjoyable but not a true standout in the category. 439 charactersNJBrews609, Jul 04, 2016

Smell is vanilla, chocolate, coffee and dark, dried fruits--super complex and outstanding. Taste gets everything in there, with a very subtle warming from the chilies on the finish. Kind of genius, the chilies, and perfectly proportioned. Feel is a rich medium, just right for the style. Alcohol very well hidden. Maybe a little under-carbed.  
A great, unique take on an imperial stout. Worth seeking out. 486 charactersBeers-es, Jul 04, 2016

4.53/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pour is pitch black with a small caramel-colored head. The head leaves no lacing as it dissipates but settles into a nice golden ring around the top of the beer. 
The aroma brings loads of sweet milk chocolate, vanilla, and roasted coffee beans, with just a touch of alcohol. Just the faintest hint of chili peppers are lurking in the background, giving a nice little tingle to the nostrils. 
The flavor has a ton of coffee up front, followed by a wave of sweet milk chocolate and faint vanilla. Finishes slightly charred, with a subtle touch of spicy chili peppers. 
The feel is full bodied with lower carbonation. Incredibly rich and smooth. Has a fair amount of alcohol warmth and lingering heat from the chili peppers. 
Overall, a fantastic imperial stout that really brings out the flavors and aromas it advertises. I'm not a fan at all of chili peppers in beer but it's done very subtly here and adds a nice spicy character to the beer without detracting from the coffee, chocolate, and vanilla. Just an excellent stout. 1,030 charactersScaryEd, Jun 22, 2016

Residue after sip oozes thickly down the glass reminiscent of the old Blob movie. Nose is not huge considering all the flavor that follows, but hints at dark chocolate and vanilla bean. Taste is incredible, delivering what is promised on the label.  Leads with some chocolate and coffee and finishes with vanilla bean and a tad of molasses. Dominant flavor seems to be the bitter vanilla, but there is plenty of other action going on too. The ancho comes in at the very end -- no heat, but a bit of spice and a touch of smoke. I also suspect the ancho is bringing out some of the other flavors.  Bottom line -- one of the best stouts I have had -- might be time for a road trip to Tulsa. 777 characters11-52_4hops, Jun 17, 2016

Poured into a pint glass, as I do not have any other beer glassware.
Look: Very dark brown color. Very thick, with no head. When held up to a light, no light passes through.
Smell: Lots of cocoa and vanilla. Smells absolutely delicious. Almost smells like something I would expect from a gourmet dessert.
Taste: Again, very dessert like. Lots of rich chocolate and vanilla flavors. Even though it is 13% ABV, you do not taste very much alcohol at all. Furthermore, you get a slight spiciness along with some coffee flavor as well. Definitely one of the best beers I have ever tasted.
Feel: Very creamy and rich.
Overall: Definitely one of the best, if not the best beer I have ever had. Absolutely delicious. 756 charactersqfs, Jun 12, 2016

Not too surprising considering the ABV. The dominant aroma in this stout is chocolate with notes of vanilla, coffee, marshmallow, and chiles. I expected more coffee. The flavor is not as special as I was expecting and certainly not worth the price of admission. Not enough coffee for me. What you do get is a nice big, slightly sweet stout flavor with notes of chocolate, smoke, ash, earth, and a finish of alcohol and chile spice and heat. Big body and smooth texture. 575 charactersmorimech, Jun 04, 2016

It pours a deep, rich mahogany - nearly black, with a creamy, khaki-colored head and lacing.  It smells of roasty malt, coffee, chocolate, caramel, molasses, and a whiff of smoke.  The taste is positively decadent:  roasted malt, burnt coffee, molasses, caramel, and pepper. The flavors blend perfectly to create one of the best tasting beers I've ever had.  It is, for an imperial stout, medium-bodied, and moderately carbonated.  You can feel the 13% ABV but it just adds to the wonderful experience of drinking this world class stout. Overall, it is simply exquisite.  What I wouldn't do to find it more frequently in New Jersey! 674 charactersMacMalt, May 29, 2016

Appearance: Pours jet black with a moderate amount of bubbles. Slight finger of tan head that settles into a thin creamy layer. 
Smell: A very roasty and rich dark malt driven aroma with a scent of coffee, chocolate, and pepper. Dark roasted barley malt with a big scent of coffee beans, dark chocolate, cacao nibs, biscuit, toast, and smoke with yeast. Sweet hints of vanilla, molasses, and cream. Some hints of chili peppers. Subtle dark fruit hints. A really great roasty aroma. 
Taste: Like it smells, a roasty, rich, and spicy dark malt driven taste with notes of coffee, chocolate, and peppers. Dark roasted barley malt with notes of coffee beans, dark chocolate, cacao nibs, toast, smoke, and biscuit along with some yeast. Sweet taste of vanilla, cream, and molasses. Moderate taste of chili pepper spice. Light dark fruit undertones. A really good taste. 
Mouthfeel: Full bodied with a moderate amount of carbonation. Rich, creamy, and fairly spicy with moderate booze heat. 
Overall: A great Imperial Stout. Good mix of chocolate and coffee flavor with a nice touch of pepper heat. 1,141 charactersMattyG85, May 28, 2016

All the flavors come together beautifully and at 13% the alcohol is hidden very well.  The only thing stopping me from drinking this all the time is the price tag.  At $8/bottle I can't say its not worth it, but definitely more than some other similar quality stouts. 345 charactersgoblue30, May 28, 2016

4.34/5  rDev -3.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Look:  Nearly black, with some brown on the edges, and a surprisingly large head for an imperial stout.  
Smell:  Coffee dominated for me, with some possible hints of the peppers lingering in the back, malt, possibly the cacao.  
Taste:  Initially, while a bit colder, I was getting just the coffee and in the aftertaste, a chili burn, but as the beer warmed I was able to detect the cacao a bit.  Apparently I'm bad at identifying vanilla.  
Feel:  medium full mouth feel that coats the mouth.  
Overall:  I would love to drink this beer again, but I was slightly disappointed with the mouth feel. 602 charactersCfred371, May 27, 2016

This is fantastic!  All the flavors I expected were immediately presented.  Lots of roasted flavors from the coffee and the roasted grain, I would presume and a raisiny, toffee like sweetness that somehow covers up the alcohol.  I have had 10% Stouts that seemed boozier.  Nice, creamy mouthfeel keeping that pepper bite at bay.  This is really well-made stuff.  NOTE:  Wondering what the BA version would taste like, I added a couple of drops of Jack Daniels to the last 5 or so ounces.  Tastes so good I wonder why the breweries don't just go this route instead of expensive barrel aging.  Throw a little bourbon (or whatever) in with some oak chips and I bet you would have a passable faux-BA stout. 811 charactersPhilsPils, May 27, 2016

Its extremely well balanced between the coffee/chocolate notes and the slight Bourbon barell aging. The abv sneaks up on you notice everything else without overpowering it. There is a slight peppery taste that makes it extra special. It may be oversweet to most stout lovers, but Honestly, if you don't like it, you're wrong! 356 charactersMrdiesel, May 26, 2016

Smells of roasted coffee malts, cocoa, some subtle vanilla sweetness, milk chocolate, and a sticky spiciness.
This taste strongly and boldly, yet has a nice balance. The sweet milk chocolate from the smell is quite present, with cocoa and spices in the aftertaste. Body is full and creamy.

Look:  Dark as death...  Black with the thinnest brown head.  Looks thick but pours thin.
Smell:  Immediately I get pepper, little alcohol, chocolate, some coffee..
Taste:  Really good - Jalapenos - very fresh ones and a nice surprise!.  Dark chocolate, coffee...   As it warmed up the fresh peppers faded and I got more warm spices, some cream and 'nilla...
Mouth feel:  Thick and rich, totally the opposite of how it appeared to pour.  Very, very satisfying.
Overall - I like this better than the Founders KBS, which has been my standard for a while in stouts.  As stouts go this is certainly the best of the best, and I would love to be able to get it readily. 780 charactersTrick420, May 23, 2016

The first aroma to rise out of the glass is a storng impression of vanilla, followed by some pepper spice and pepper flesh, as well as milk chocolate, fudge, sweet tobacco, and some cinnamon. The flavor begins with milk chocolate, vanilla, and cream, followed by notes of mild coffee, cinnamon, nuitmeg and other warm spiceds, and the heat comes through just a bit on the end. The mouthfeel is hugely thick and creamy, honestly about the texture of heavy cream. Overall I get the hype - this is a superb beer 563 charactersCzequershuus, May 23, 2016

As advertised, this a fantastic brew. The aroma was probably the only thing that didn't sing to me. While it wasn't flat, it came across fairly weak, compared to the taste. Taste-wise, was a tale of 2 stages. The 1st stage was very good. I picked up on the vanilla, the coffee, the malts, and the alcohol. The alcohol was not overpowering though, as it blended into the taste factor nicely. Stage 2 was about halfway through (I took my time drinking this), the pepper really started to come into play. What a great way to finish a thick, smooth beer like this. 
While I typically don't go for the higher ABV beers, I'm currently going through a taste-testing stage for Imperial Stout beers. Most of my previous tastes are one shot samplings.. but I will definitely have another Bomb on hand for a revisit to this exceptional beer. 873 charactersspelingchampeon, May 17, 2016

The alcohol heat is too intense (does this beer need to be this strong?), which negatively impacts the whole experience. The vanilla and chili mix well together, but I end up with the impression that this beer is all about the additional flavours, making it hard to get at the base beer. That said, the vanilla tastes great and the slight heat is pleasant; the whole package is quite luxurious, but for the heat. It's very good, but if it was toned down a bit I think it would be a real improvement. 617 charactersjrenihan, May 16, 2016

Aroma is big roasted malts big doses of coffee and chocolate. Smaller doses of chilies that also lean toward vinous fruit notes and vanilla.
Taste is big also like the nose chocolate and big coffee doses swim with vanilla and light chili notes. Just the amount of chili peppers to give it a kick without distracting. Some nice sweetness almost molasses like finishes with sweetness, vanilla and chili pepper kick.
Mouthfeel is big nice and smooth with mellow carbonation.
Overall not a bad stout, do like the chili pepper kick. But might be rated tad to high while very good its not blowing my mind or anything maybe at half the price it might blow my mind. 808 charactersmntlover, May 12, 2016

Unlike anything I've had before. Silky smooth with a lingering heat that complements, not overpowers, the flavor profile. One of those whole-is-better-than-the-sum-of-its-parts experiences. You can imagine how each component will taste individually but not the whole. Somehow worth the money. 594 charactersManapuaMan, May 11, 2016

500th beer!
Appearance: Pours a deep, dark black with just the slightest evidence of a tan head on the top of the beer, clinging to the sides of the glass slightly before dissolving under influence from the high ABV.
Smell: Quite a complex nose, with strong assertions of cocoa powder, coffee, mocha-like sweetness, and vanilla. Not picking up much of the chilli peppers in the nose.
Taste: Clean and clear flavors identifiable with nothing really being muddled together, which is nice for a stout of this repute. I picked up more of that mocha-coffee sweetness, likely due to the coffee and cacao nibs interacting together. You could pick out coffee notes but also a definitive chocolate as well. Soft vanilla sweetness in the midpalate and back end. Again, not picking up much from the chilis at all, though there is a bit of cut of something not sweet at the very back of the palate, which I attribute to the chilis. Perfectly masked alcohol, even at 13%.
Mouthfeel: Large body with medium carbonation. It's big and it drinks big. I felt like the small 6oz serving was perfect at the bar I was at though, which kept me from feeling bogged down in the beer.
Overall: A marvelous brew and one I would highly recommend. Definitely a treat for my 500th brew! 1,311 charactersBeric, May 09, 2016

big coffee on the nose and a nice roasty scent coming from the coffee and malt profile. palate is similar - sticky sweet chocolate, molasses/brown sugar, burnt malts and coffee, caramel and a subtle vanilla. also getting some raisins and a bit of spice on the finish ... really nice stuff. full bodied, good mouthfeel and very drinkable considering the abv, which you dont really pick up. overall glad to try this one and am definitely eager to try some aged versions. 578 charactersHyptochrons, May 08, 2016

Opaque seal brown body supports a thin layer of ecru foam which recedes to a sizable ring round an island of micro-bubbles. Decent retention, fragile legs, delicate lacing.
Intense nose with surprising synergy among the aromas - cocoa, coffee, and vanilla appear almost in equal measure. The base malt offers further roast aromatics, though above all the smell is sweet, like a fine demerara sugar. 
Brown sugar, not-particularly-dark-chocolate, smooth (medium roast?) coffee, and gentle grain notes fill the palate - the vanilla lingers on a bit longer, and the faint savory (roast?) chile note keeps things from being cloying despite an almost candy-like finish. This one definitely favors clarity over complexity, with the big flavor additions dominating the beer and concealing any hint of heat from the alcohol. Well crafted, without the slightest hint of bitter, sour, or acrid notes, let alone any off flavors.
Creamy, almost oily, medium-full-bodied mouth-feel with sufficient carbonation. 
It's interesting to have a big rich stout like this that isn't barrel aged for once, but the flavor (while not insipid) is a bit too simplistic compared to the best of the breed - sort of like a painting executed in primary colors, it's attention grabbing and impressive, but at the expense of nuance. 1,358 charactersaugustgarage, May 08, 2016

4.24/5  rDev -5.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Picked up a bottle at Arch Bridge the other day.  My first chance to try this highly regarded beer.  
The beer pours a black brown color with good head retention and lacing.  The nose is certainly attractive in this beer, as I get considerable chocolate, vanilla, maybe some light black cherry, and then some underlying coffee.  The flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely, with the chocolate and vanilla really dominating.  I pick up a hint of the ancho chili peppers I guess, but this beer is pretty sweet, and it probably use a bit more of a chili bite on the finish.  Mouthfeel is fairly full, and the finish is long and smooth.  Alcohol is very well integrated into the flavor profile, and frankly, I was surprised by the 13% abv.  
Nice beer, no doubt, though I'm not sure I'm quite as in love with it as some of the folks who have reviewed this beer.  I do appreciate the 12 ounce bottle format, however, and the price point seemed OK (here in Oregon, I paid $8.75 for a bottle).  Anyway, I'm glad to finally have the chance to try this one at long last. 1,073 charactersJohn_M, May 02, 2016
2.9/5  rDev -35.3%look: 3 | smell: 3 | taste: 2.75 | feel: 3 |  overall: 3Very dark. Minimal head that dissipated quickly, no lacing. A bit of an orange-ish halo when held to the light.
Aroma of sour stout. Nothing much that suggests coffee or vanilla.
Flavor shows some coffee but not as much as expected. The high alcohol is evident as is the chili pepper when you walk away from it for a minute. General impression is that it is trying too hard to be too much of everything at once.
Mouthfeel generally flat, mostly triggers mid-central receptors of the tongue. Relatively clean aftertaste for a high abv brew.
Maybe I got an off bottle but just not excited at all about this. Maybe I've developed Imperial Stout fatigue...I would much prefer a 3.5-4.5% seasonable stout with some balance. This is too plum/alcohol for me. 751 charactersAngryDutchman, May 01, 2016

Update: The review above was from a fresh bottle.  I later had the chance to have it on tap and the keg was aged 6mo - really brought out the peppers! 419 charactersbbtkd, May 01, 2016

4.51/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Since this beer has been reviewed plenty of times, I'm not doing a full point by point review, but rather just putting down my overall thoughts. 
This beer is beautiful looking (even without any head) and smelled amazing, however, unlike many people here, I did not pick up any pepper notes either in the smell or taste - perhaps because it was left sitting for about 4 months? Either way, it was very good. 
But what really set this beer apart from any I've ever had like it was the feel. Seriously, its like drinking a fudge brownie - just so decadent. That brownie analogy also applies to the sweetness of the beer. Its just a bit too sweet for my taste, Id like a bit of a drier cacao finish rather than sweet brownie batter, but hey, thats just a minor quibble. 768 charactersFBarber, Apr 20, 2016
3.54/5  rDev -21%look: 3.25 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Appearance: pours black, maybe a little bit of mahogany on the edges. a small tan head that fades pretty quickly and leaves nothing behind. completely dark and opaque. 
Smell: huge coffee flavor that either mixes with or comes off a bit like the peppers. strong chocolate-y fudge. very faint vanilla. peppers return in the finish.
Taste: opens with a little bit of chocolate that gives off strong fudge like notes. strong pepper heat comes in and mixes with coffee. some roastiness  barely makes it through along with a touch of vanilla bean. more pepper heat and taste near the end. 
Mouthfeel: nice thick and a bit chewy. heat leave is good and not to strong. a little deceiving for 13%
Overall: the coffee flavor adds complexity to the pepper flavor which I can see being a good thing but I just can't come around to the taste. I do really like the fudgey body and like the level that the heat comes in. could pack a bit more alcohol punch though. 954 charactersSportsandJorts, Apr 20, 2016

Feel= Nice and cream, with some tingling on the tongue and roof of the mouth. A little bit of pepper burn at the end.

Big mouthfeel with lower carbonation and a slick, wet finish. The chili spice is not very present until the aftertaste builds up after multiple sips. I am a fan of spice so this feels very mild to me, but it's there. The chocolate is noticeable throughout and is not overly sweet. Overall a very good beer. 547 charactersMrHolden, Apr 13, 2016

pours black, no head, probably because i poured it very smooth given the small size of the snifter, but a thin tan foam did form. Bubbles rise from the sides of the glass
smell is of instant dark chocolate, slightly sweet but immediately followed by the chili pepper presence. Coffee can be picked up, and an alcohol afterscent persists
spicy at first sip, followed by a rush of coffee then chocolatey chewiness (reminded me of M&M's lol)
smooth and creamy, the spiciness sits in the throat and tongue between sips, and gets slightly spicier with time and warmth
I had barely noticed right before I drank this that they put chili peppers in it. I hate spicy food and I had already seen a few beers on BA that have peppers and the idea seemed unappealing to me, but here spiciness was separated from heat, it was incredibly enjoyable and I had more fun drinking this stout than any other up to date. A must have for anyone who likes stouts 974 charactersNin10dude64, Apr 13, 2016

Look: Black, thin cinnamon head which completely disappears
Smell: complex but I get coffee and chocolate
Taste: coffee, chocolate, some peppery heat
Feel:  solid and slippery
Overall: pretty good 307 charactersfx20736, Apr 10, 2016

4.59/5  rDev +2.5%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Appearance: Black as night, holds a thin ring of dark tan head.
Aroma: Malt extract, burnt grain, hint of a citric hop.
Taste: Heavy toffee notes, burnt sugar sweetness, bit of molasses, a dose of dusty earthy notes in the finish try to explain why it doesn't all go cloyingly sweet. Bitters are coming from a coffee note as well.
Mouthfeel: Viscous, chewy, heavy body with low carbonation. Dry finish has a little alcoholic heat.
Overall: Big impact! Malt monster goes down like a old fashioned hard toffee candy. A little smoky burnt coffee gives it some depth and character. Hops are very background, but doing some heavy lifting to keep this enjoyable. I get the big numbers, I can't throw any serious stones at them. This is clean, big, bold, and tasty. It's pricey too, so I won't be getting a lot of them, but will probably reach for another. 853 charactersHardTarget, Apr 10, 2016

Smells if chocolate and vanilla. This is my first bomb beer and can't wait to try the other variant. There was just the right amount of heat from the peppers. Well worth the hype. Too bad I missed out on the bourbon  barrel  version. I won't miss out on pirate bombing coming soon. 377 charactersK-Dog, Apr 09, 2016

4.17/5  rDev -6.9%look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Pours black from a 12z bottle, looks like it's marked 4/15 so it's about a year old. Looks perfect, with no head. When I stop pouring it attempts to form some suds but gives up the ghost after barely getting a thin layer. No lacing.
Smells like cocoa -- instant chocolate , no coffee, no malt.
Taste is of bitter baker's chocolate, and dark fruit in there quite distinct, along with tart of the fruit. It's very nicely balanced, and malt gives it a caramel body, but doesn't go too bready. Very sippable, almost like a porter rather than an imperial. No push-back at all. Yes, it's resiny and heavy and boozy at the finish but otherwise the alcohol is hidden extremely well. Hard to believe this is 13%.
I'm not getting any of the ancho chili peppers. Maybe it needs to warm... the caramel malt becomes more evident and burnt coffee is a little more obvious as it opens up. Body is getting more complex the longer I swirl and sip --there's the ever so slightest hint of the chili peppers now but I'm looking for it -- the pepper thing is a non-starter, at least for this bottle, oh well.
I have another bottle to age to see if the pepper flavor might come out more -- at $10 a 12oz I'm not sure how many of these I'll be grabbing to experiment further...
Nevertheless, a fine imperial stout that's chocolate forward, and easily drinkable. 1,343 charactersRogerlb, Apr 08, 2016

4.04/5  rDev -9.8%look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4Poured from a 12oz bottle into a tulip glass.
Appearance- Black and thick....not much head
Smell - I smell a lot chocolate, not a whole lot of coffee smell.  Something else, maybe vanilla? 
Taste - Again, a lot of chocolate.  Not that that is a bad thing but I was expecting more coffee.  A little disappointed in that I didn't really taste the the chili peppers.  I was waiting for a little burn at the end but did not get it.  
Mouthfeel - Very thick, hides the alcohol very well for a 13% beer.  Low carbonation
Overall -  It was not what I really expected.  I loved xocoveza and was hoping this would be similar.  But the chocolate flavor took over a little too much.  The chocolate flavor was great and It did a great job of hiding the alcohol but I was hoping the coffee and chili would have more of a presence.  It's also a little pricey at $10 for a 12oz bottle.  I have a second bottle that I'll age a little and try again. 937 charactersmichaelsmith11, Apr 07, 2016

Smell is very strong of chocolate and malts. Taste is similar, instant chocolate followed by malt and a faint vanilla and coffee. Blends together well and is surprisingly smooth for 13%. Carbonation is moderate compared to other imperial stouts. 348 charactersEchris21, Apr 07, 2016

Tasted mostly chocolate with light coffee. I did not taste the peppers, like many who have. It felt like a soda that was shaken until all the carbonation was gone, very flat. It wasn't bad, just different. The 13% was well hidden. I bought it for 7.99, so I can't complain about the price. 373 charactersUscjojo, Apr 06, 2016

Appearance: Thick motor oil black with medium to heavy bubbles on the body. Head is a nice natural dark tan color rising lightly to maybe to half a finger's length. Drops to nada after a sip with sticky lacing. 
Smell: Light mocha and coffee, you smell a cold caramel...Hovers the nostrils but not the most sticking scent. 
Taste: Cimplex coffee, hints of nutmeg and chocolate...the chocolate overpowers most of the taste but that isn't a bad thing. Trust me not a taste you forget.
Overall: You see it, buy it. Picked it up on draft at Tap and Barrel here in Smithtown, NY...priceless. Grab a glass and thank me later. Salud!...PS. picked up my second serving of this brew here at MGM in Minnesota and the brew delivered better the second time around. Quick reminder of what's good for you. 854 charactersBlurryVisi0n, Apr 04, 2016

3.85/5  rDev -14.1%look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 3.75Appearance - Pours near black, dark cola brown with a thin, light tan colored head. Sub-par retention, quickly breaking down to an island of suds in the center of the glass. Lacing consists of a few small spots found randomly around the glass.
Smell - Sweet, with vanilla and cream being the abundant aroma. Fair sour funk and booze. Lesser milk chocolate and a hint of coffee and spice. 
Taste - Follows the nose. Sweet vanilla with some odd, slightly sour funk. Good amount of Cream.  Faint coffee notes buried beneath the sweetness. Back end hits on cheap easter milk chocolate and a touch of heat from the chili peppers. 
Mouthfeel - Full-bodied with low, creamy carbonation. Very smooth, and for 13% it drinks like a dream. Easily the highlight of this brew.
Overall - This is good, but it isn't doing much for me. The depth simply isn't there, as the sweetness prevails while lacking any kind of significant roast or bittering balance. At $10 per 12oz bottle it's a steep price to pay, and I'll rest easy knowing I'll never have the urge to buy it again. 1,064 charactersTheSixthRing, Apr 01, 2016

Mouth feel. Full body. Taste. At first, more vanilla and cocoa, second and third sips, taste of chili peppers, just enough. Aftertaste. Very well rounded. Sweet but not too sweet.  Overall. Beautiful strong imperial stout. If there was one beer to take on a deserted  island, this might be the one. I'd forget about being stranded alone. Perfect balance of sweet, spicy, and strong. Will buy again very soon. Thankful that it's plentiful here in the OKC. 560 charactersslavetothemessiah, Apr 01, 2016

Tastes like an amazing stout with a touch of heat.  Perfect amount of heat as other beers have gone overboard.  
This beer will fill you up and leave your tongue feeling the touch of heat.  Makes y in want more.
Overall worth the hype.  Love that I got a wax version.  One of my favorite Stouts, but definitely my favorite chili pepper fused stout. 551 charactersJay_P22, Mar 31, 2016

pours black with a small tan head that dissipates into a ring.
great aromas from this one. chocolate, coffee, slight vanilla. faint hint of booze.
all the aromas come through in the taste, except the alcohol. instead, the faint burn of the chili at the back of the throat and sides of the tongue. really rolls around the tongue beautifully. alcohol is hidden. 
mouth is just between medium and full.
overall, this is a really fine beer, a nice sipper over an hour or so. 550 charactersMikeWard, Mar 28, 2016

Aroma is deep and dark...equal parts cocoa nibs and coffee beans with a soft vanilla sweetness and waft of dried chilies.  Dark chocolate cake and a cup of sweetened coffee in the mouth.  Booze is remarkably absent in the nose and flavor, just a little warmth in the throat that works with the subtle spice.  Silky, moderately full body - again, easy enough to drink that you'd have no idea this was such a big beer.  I generally have a hard time with massive, under-attenuated, sticky-sweet beers and this thankfully isn't one of them.  Absolutely worth the cost of a bottle every once in a while as a treat.

I've been aging it in my cellar until right now.  A bottle of the 2015 vintage.  Poured out of a 12 oz. bottle into one of my tulip glasses, this beer pours a very dark brown, almost black color with a very tan/light brown head that's about 2/3 of an inch thick when first poured.  Settles to a fairly thick ring lining the inside of the glass along with a large patch of a film layer of surface foam on the beer's surface.  Aromas of cocoa, coffee, vanilla and chili peppers are all quite strong indeed.  I could smell these aroma very clearly when the glass was about 2 feet away from my nose.  This may be the strongest aroma in some respects that I've ever experienced with a beer before.   Flavors of roasted malts along with chocolate and vanilla notes that give way to some black coffee bitterness followed by a bit of a bite from the chili peppers that is all rounded out with a bit of an earthy hop bitterness.  An absolutely fantastic flavor profile here indeed!   Everything is perfectly balanced and all the flavors compliment each other so nicely.  Delicious!  Has a fairly crisp, yet smooth and somewhat creamy, just slightly tingly, medium to full bodied mouthfeel with light to moderate carbonation.  The flavors really linger on the palate nicely for a few minutes after each sip.  Has a clean, dry finish.  Extremely easy to drink, especially with the 13% ABV this beer has.  I had to check myself a few times to insure I properly savored this beer and didn't gulp it down, its that good.  This is one beer that you truly with your glass of was never ending.  I really hope I get the chance to have this one again because this is an absolutely amazing beer!

Pours an ink black with little to no head.  No signs of lacing along the sides of the glass.  
Strong coffee and chocolate aroma.  
Taste of vanilla, coffee, with a mild chili pepper burn on the back end.  
Mildly carbonated and a bit thin.  
Good 13% stout at a $7.99 price tag.  Glad this one is relatively available, but don't plan on drinking more than one in a setting. 416 charactersbrian44556, Mar 19, 2016

4.53/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I enjoyed this from the bottle in a goblet style snifter.
The color is opaque black with small head with ring of beads and legs on the glass. The smell is great lots of cocoa drenched odors with mild coffee and vanilla with a slight sweet odor and light smell of peppery with earthy quality and gentle alcohol aroma. The feel is superb with a lovely mix of smooth cocoa and medium carbonation level with nutty roast and semi-spiced quality with a mostly dry texture mid palate with mild warmth of alcohol and chili in the finish.
This is a great stout with very nice blend of spice -cocoa, mild vanilla and a coffee/cocoa flavor mid taste with mild earthy chili flavor that adds to the complexity with a mild toast in the finish with semi-dry quality with slight alcohol the chili taste is just enough with a mostly cocoa dominant flavor in the finish with very subtle alcohol. This is a wonderful stout so deliciously blended with all the adjunct flavors represented so well in the taste w/ an excellent base stout that hides the alcohol well 1,045 charactersSlatetank, Mar 14, 2016

4.2/5  rDev -6.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Pours inky black, light brown head with strong lacing. Dark malt, chocolate, vanilla(a lot) bouquet. Smooth, malty, nice coffee, vanilla, cocoa flavor with just the barest heat as the endnote. Mouthfeel is medium, minimal effervescence and a tad syrupy. Strong alcohol notes, but overall quite pleasant.
An enjoyable beer, a bit cloying, and may be better classified as a desert beer or after dinner cordial. Tasty, but I could barely finish one, much less drink more than one. Good but not quaffable. 501 charactersThaneMcC, Mar 11, 2016

APPEARANCE (4.25) - Pours very dark, but thin, with a light brown head that fades to a ring and does leave a few patches of lacing along the glass as you drink. Not super impressive to start off, but coffee does tend to screw with head retention (I don't know how the boys in Quebec do it with Peche Mortel).
SMELL (4.25) - I pick up sugary, chocolate malt, a LOT of sugar, reminding me of Even More Jesus, and a slight vegetal note from the peppers. Probably vanilla mixed in with the sugar, but it's hard to tell. Trending toward too sweet.
TASTE (4.5) - The first thing I pick up is a sort of caramel-covered figgy syrupy sweetness, which fades into a coffee-chocolate note, and then vanilla, and finally a combination of alcohol and chili burn. The peppers don't influence the taste at all and only come up after the swallow, with a slow rising intensity that never gets far past a mild heat. Good, very good even, but verging on being cloyingly sweet here.
FEEL (4.0) - Creamy, but thin, never rising past medium bodied. I've had saisons, IPAs, and maibocks with this sort of heft before. Still, pleasing, with low carbonation, the only prickliness coming from the alcohol or the peppers.
OVERALL (4.25) - Absolutely a great stout that I would certainly buy more of off and on if I had regular access to it at a local shop, but nothing I'm going to chase out of state in the future. I would be remiss if I forgot to mention the 13% abv is extremely, extremely tame. This makes BOMB! the strongest beer I've ever drank (being an Ohioan, we cap at 12% locally), and I'd always been leery that anything stronger might just be a gnarly, prickly, hot alcohol bomb, but, ironically, BOMB! is smooth, with little to no burn from the alcohol itself. A very good beer that I'm glad I tried, I really love Prairie and the spirit of a lot that they do, this one to me, just doesn't really live up to the hype. Not a 99/100 beer to my palate. 2,042 charactersBradenMK, Mar 10, 2016

Pours black, with hints of ruby around the edge. Head stuck around for longer than I expected for 13%
Aroma was mainly sweet vanilla and chocolate and some milky coffee, but very pungent and filled the room with the aroma.
Taste wise: Perfect balance between all the ingredients. Smooth, sweet, chocolatey, spicy, grassy coffee. Tons of body to go with it, and a nice silky smooth carbonation. 424 charactersBearBeerReviews, Mar 04, 2016

12 oz. bottle from Copper Vine ($8.59) poured into a Stone snifter.
A- Cool label art, and a funky catfish on the cap.  A 1-finger, brown head is created with a normal pour.  The body is jet black, showing very dark brown/red edges when held to light.  The head settles to a thin film, and there are rings left on the glass from just a swirl, even more so with a sip.  
S- It's straight up chocolate on first inspection.  Coffee is another dominant trait.  With some warmth, I get a distinct, vanilla sweetness and a hint of heat from the peppers.  Some warmth and there is an impression that this packs a serious ABV punch.  In the end, it all gets very bold without overwhelming the senses.
T- Oh, that's nice!  Bold and complex.  I get a lot of coffee and semi-sweet chocolate, much like a chocolate flavored coffee my wife used to keep stocked for weekend brewing.  The chili peppers play a supportive role, and do a great job through the finish.  It all comes together nicely, with no element dominating.  I wouldn't mind just a little more heat on the back end.  Though my wife said it was "a lot of chili pepper," to each his/her own.  With a little warmth, everything gets amplified, without changing any of the balance, maybe stepping up the vanilla and peppers more so.
M- Full bodied and viscous.  There's a little alcohol warmth and a little bite from the peppers.  A little long in the finish, perhaps.
O- At the pricing point, it's a special treat for sure.  That said, I'm glad I listened to my "beer guy, Jim" and pulled the trigger.  I would definitely buy a couple more to hold onto for a special occasion.  It's difficult to find many faults in this beer.

Smell: fresh ground coffe milk chocolate cacao vanilla
Taste: upfront you get vanilla milk chocolate. Middle of the mouth fresh medium roast coffe cacao more milk chocolate a slight hint of dark chocolate some chilli pepper. the finish is really when you get the heat from the chili pepper vanilla sweet hot chocolate.
Feel: vey smooth and creamy a big bodied beer With a dry finish.
Overall: this beer is very complex. At 13% abv you don't even taste the alchool very easy drinking for how high the abv is. The chilli pepper really comes through in the finish and warms the chest. It adds a whole new character to this beer. Please try this beer you won't be disappointed. 719 charactersMasonz223, Feb 27, 2016

The nose has obvious notes of spice, along with roasted malts, sweet chocolate and vanilla. The taste is slightly spicy, but doesn't have a lot of heat and is fairly one-note. The sweet chocolate holds up the back-end. The mouthfeel is the most impressive part, as it is extremely smooth, creamy and thick.

Opaque brownish black, minimum dark head.  The beer coats the glass for seconds when swirled.
Aroma of alcohol, caramel, vanilla, fruity coffee.  Maybe reminds me of a coffee hard candy from long ago.
The taste is complex on this one. Vanilla start, coffee middle, oak shows up, then chili after almost all liquid is off the tongue.
Mouth feel is even more complex than the taste. A swig coats everything in your mouth until carbonation seems to take hold and magically scrubs everything, chili finishes the mouth cleaning and it all disappears to dry, dry dry.
I see what all the fuss is about with Bomb.  If I had to complain I would say its a little too sweet in the middle for me, but a fine beer none the less. 840 characterswoodchipper, Feb 21, 2016

S: Lots of roasted malts, coffee, and chili peppers up front with the cocoa nibs and vanilla more towards the back. Almost no alcohol presence
T: Follows the nose, but the vanilla is hugely bumped up. Starts off with the roasted malts and some vanilla sweetness, followed by coffee and cocoa. The peppery heat slowly kicks in but never gets overwhelming. Amazingly, theres is no trace of alcohol to be found. Finishes with some peppery heat, vanilla, and roast
M: Medium-full bodied with moderate carbonation
O: (Almost) everything you could want in a stout. Plenty of coffee and vanilla, good roastiness, and a nice peppery kick to finish things off. Not to mention, the 13% is completely taken out of the picture in terms of distractions. Definitely a must try if you're a fan of imperial stouts 876 charactersBEERMILER12, Feb 17, 2016

Smell: The chili peppers caught me off guard. Chocolate and slight vanilla are also present once you get past the dominating peppers.
Taste: Glad the pepper isn't as strong as it smells. Predominantly chocolate; cocoa nibs.
Feel: Slightly heavy coating but not bad for an imp stout. The peppers do give a little burn; more pleasing than their aggressive odor. Surprisingly clean finish; not much lingers.
Overall: despite not being thrilled by the use of peppers here (too much) it does all come together In the end. If they could tone down the nose I think this would be better for me. 714 charactersdhitchcox, Feb 15, 2016

M: It was thick with a little carbonation. Nice slick body.
D: This was a great stout with lots of complexity. The chili flavor was there without the heat, which was a wonderful touch. The body was solid, and the finish was smooth. But there was some alcohol warming, so it was better to sip. Age could help mellow. Fresh is still great. Recommended, if you can find it. 653 charactersPencible, Feb 12, 2016

L - Black, thin head that disepated to a ring rather quick. 
S - cherry and dark chocolate, bit of coffee. the chocolate is so deep and creamy on the nose. i love how rich the chocolate smells. 
T - coffee, choco, vanilla and then a light spice on the end is a good summary. The perfect amount of spice on the end. The perfect vanilla bean, coffee and creamy chocolate front. One of my lowest rated beers is the Sculpin Habanero but this is perfectly balanced use of chili pepper to me. Just light spice on the end, cooled by the cream of the chocolate. The more you sip the more complex the flavors become in your mouth. Take your time with this one. This is a real treat.
F - smooth. could be a bit more velvety but isnt over carbonated by any stretch of the imagination. very nice.
O - Prairie if you're reading this please start distributing this beer in MA regularly! 949 charactersbeantown_hopster, Feb 12, 2016

4.97/5  rDev +10.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5LOOKS: Black, up to the light, a light brown around the edges. Plenty of small bubble carbonation rising. Pours no real head, but the thin layer on top of the beer is dark tan, and creamy/frothy. The residue of that head kind of slides down the sides of the glass like molten lava.
AROMA: First, sweetness overall. Then VERY dark roasted coffee, dark bittersweet chocolate, roasted jalapeno pepper, and the vanilla is definitely there, as well. Smells phenomenal!
TASTE: Wow, just almost overwhelming big flavors thrown at you... almost all at once. Very hard to describe the order. Sweetness, bitter, coffee, chocolate, peppers and vanilla. Then the peppers linger afterwards, nicely. There is a cool astringency in the back of the palate/tongue, but not harsh. Just like it's saying, Hey!, I'm back here too, Dude!
FEEL: Plenty of carbonation, texture is a little prickly on the tongue, but I think that really gets the flavors moving around a bit. Body is medium full to full and a bit sticky. 
OVERALL: Explosion of flavors here. So much so that i really didn't notice any alcohol in the aroma or taste. Aroma alone is worth the price, IMHO. Flavors back it up. 1,165 charactersmatcris, Feb 06, 2016

L- Dark, some light comes through on the pour but not much in the glass, half finger of medium brown head that dissipated to a ring. 
S- Some dark fruits, dark chocolate, light amount of that green pepper coffee aroma, little bit of vanilla, not much pepper maybe a little, some alcohol is noticeable but not a lot. 
T- Similar to aroma, chocolate is the biggest flavor, very smooth for 13%, getting more coffee on the end, medium roasted notes, not too  sweet, some vanilla and pepper but not really as much as expected. 
F- Great, full, silky. 
O- This is a great beer that I'm glad to see now available in Michigan, the flavors are big and balanced and it's one of the smoothest high abv beers I've had. Only complaint is that it is expensive which will probably keep me from buying it on a regular basis. 891 charactersPaulyB83, Feb 06, 2016

The taste is likewise excellent; this is the third Mexican Chocolate-esque imperial stout I've had thus far (the other two being Abraxas and Xocoveza), and it's undoubtedly the best. It has more in common with Xocoveza than Abraxas, both in texture and the emphasis on dark chocolate as opposed to the thinner, more cinnamon-forward Abraxas. Paradoxically, the chocolate notes BOMB! are both richer and less sweet than in Xocoveza, which I like. If only this were distributed to my state and at a comparable price to Stone's offering. 643 charactersSir_Whats-his-face, Feb 05, 2016

4.31/5  rDev -3.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.25Pours dense and syrupy.  Very dark chocolate brown SRM 29-31. A fine coffee foam casually sits there while lazy columns of carbonation meander up the inside of the glass. Black, inside a Breckenridge floral etched snifter, with a fine fog of lace.
The aroma contains strong chocolate, punctuated by chili powder. Deep roasted malt and roasted coffee round out the profile.
Surprisingly sweet, BOMB!, is tempered by roasted malt bitterness and mild, spicy heat. Other flavors include chocolate, espresso, walnuts, and pepper. The short finish contains heat, while warmth brings out fresh berries.
The dense body and syrupy texture are defining characteristics. Carbonation seems to form a fine coating on the tongue. While alcohol is present, it is dramatically below expectations. This beer finishes dry, leaving a sugary residue.
Perhaps best as a dessert beer, the experience is far easier than one might expect from a 14% AVB Chili Beer called "BOMB!" with all the caps and an exclamation point. This beer works well while reading, but I imagine would also be suitable with ice cream or a cigar. 1,102 charactersSLeffler27, Jan 31, 2016

Within the past year, I have experimented with a many stouts developing my palate. Prairie - BOMB! was one of my first stouts that I tried. Over the year I have been able to get fresher bottles of it so I will go off my most recent. 
Look: poorer into a snifter with dark brown/black. Very little head that dissipates fast. 
Smell: the chocolate is up front with the coffee underneath. I can smell a little pepper on it with strong smokey malt in the back end. 
Taste: wow, this beer hits you up front with the coffee. The more it warms up, the more chile comes out of it. It isn't overbearing by any stretch. It is just very subtle heat just to show you it is there. I love it. It cuts through that malt so well. 
Feel: like syrup, it is very thick. 
Overall: I would just simply say this is fantastic. The price is overkill, but I bought a couple of these to celebrate on rare occasions. I really like this beer putting it up there with some of my favorites. If you never have tried it and love stouts, seek it out. It is worth the hype! 1,107 charactersNhens0016, Jan 30, 2016

Taste is rich and complex. Chocolate, vanilla, bourbon, dark roasted malt, espresso. Nice blend of bitter and sweet and just a hint of heat from the chiles. Just about perfect.
Mouthfeel likewise is almost impeccable. Smooth and slick, full-bodied, coating.

4.75/5  rDev +6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Pours black from 12oz. bottle. Looks to have medium body, maybe 1/2 finger tan head that dissipates and leaves a very skimpy ring. No lacing, but a nice clean, glassy look.
Smell is fantastic. Thick cocoa and coffee, some peppery notes tickle the nose and really distinguish this stout. Medium body and no carbonation. Really slick; slides around on the tongue. Lots of bitterness, but they don't overwhelm the pallet, leave that to the cocoa and coffee. Wow, this is just layers of flavor. Some vanilla late in the nose. Probably a bunch of other flavors I'm missing... really good.
Overall, I'm upset I waited so long to try this. Its not cheap, but makes for an excellent night cap, and something you can really savor for a while. A++ 739 charactersGreatStoutman, Jan 24, 2016

3.5 A:  Black color.  About half a finger of frothy light brown head formed and quickly fell.  A short interrupted ring of lacing is left.
4.75 S:  Wow, you can really smell the flavors in this without really trying.  It's a super potent spicy crème brulee type of aroma.  Cocoa nibs, coffee, vanilla beans all stand out in the open with the chiles adding a spicy heat.  The base offers a smooth, supple roastiness, layers of chocolate and caramel, and sweet neutral malts.  Really nice nose.
4.75 T:  Like the nose, the additives blend magnificently and run the show.  The chiles are immediately noticeable with a perfectly complementary level of heat.  Nibs, vanilla, and coffee are all running on all cylinders.  Sweet overall with a soft roastiness, caramel, molasses, and neutral sweetness.
4.5 M:  Heavier medium to heavy body.  Good moderate carbonation.  Pleasantly creamy and super smooth.  Booze is minor and well hidden with a light warming finish.
4.75 D:  Really loving this beer.  One of the best non-BA beer out there. 1,062 charactersDavoleBomb, Jan 19, 2016
4.31/5  rDev -3.8%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Pours a velvetty smooth, light and dark brown at first, then black takes over at full pour, with a thin tan head.
Balanced levels of vanilla, chocolate, coffee and stout on the nose. The coffee lends a sort of sweet, fruitiness to it.
The coffee fruitiness comes through on the taste as well. Chili contributes when swirled around the tongue, but does not heat up on the backend, which is quite nice and different than the norm. As it warms, the chili does become more prominent.
This is a very well balanced, smooth and substantial brew. I did not realize it was 13% until after I finished it off and looked at the bottle a second time. However, do not sit on these. I've had a rather lengthily aged one, and it lost all coffee and vanilla elements, even the chili was gone, and was replaced by raisin and prune almost exclusively. 835 charactersSabtos, Jan 18, 2016

4.16/5  rDev -7.1%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Midnight colored body, a rough pour yields only trace head that disappears entirely. Tranquil, no carbonation apparent. It looks like motor oil in a glass, but not as viscous. Nose is sweet, with notes of semisweet chocolate, vanilla, marshmallow, coffee and a bit of its acidity. The vanilla takes the lead on the palate, but the rest of the entourage is close behind with the addition of faint chipotle pepper heat on the finish. I could use a bit more spice from this out-of-left-field flavor, or perhaps just less of the mollifying vanilla and almost out of control sweetness. After a while a note of fleshy overripe fruit like figs or dates comes through. Medium to heavy body, barest amount of carbonation but I wouldn't want any more anyway, fairly sticky. To its credit, the semi-light body is the only giveaway of the massive alcohol presence contained within.
Sugar BOMB! It was well constructed and gave roughly equal representation to each component (too much vanilla too little pepper), but damn was it sweet. It needed a heavier body as well. 1,056 characters1000lbgrizzly, Jan 18, 2016

Plenty is going on in the aroma, with hints of coffee, cocoa nibs, and malts. Taste is opened up with a smooth mix of malt and cocoa, followed by a little bit of coffee. Feel is exceptional. It certainly is robust, and creamy. Great mouth presence. Overall, this is a great beer. Certainly worth picking up and trying. Plenty going on with each snif and sip.

This is the most complex beers I have ever tasted, and one of the best.  The intensity of the flavors, and the amount it just divine.  
The cocoa hits hard at first, but then the vanilla seeps in as does the coffee.  The pepper taste is hinted.  Barely there but in the perfect amount.  
I'm glad I was able to cross this off my list, and glad I saved one.
If this brewery had been around when I went to Oklahoma State I likely would have gone broke. 494 charactersSeanem44, Jan 11, 2016

Look: Like black coffee with a thin head that seems to dissipate quickly leaving only a few very small bubbles around the perimeter of the glass.
Smell: Tons of dark roasted coffee, vanilla, chocolate, with a hint of chipotle pepper in the back. I don't pick up any alcohol in the smell and it truly does remind me of Vanilla Ice-cream topped with chocolate and coffee beans.
Taste: Really nice vanilla appears first followed by a strong black coffee and chocolate taste; similar to a mocha. Just the right amount of heat from both the alcohol and peppers in the back. Perfectly balanced. 
Feel: Like silk. Medium body but seems to coat the entirety of the mouth with these great flavors.
Overall: Might be my new favorite stout. Perfect for winter months sitting next to the fire and sipping on something delicious; sip slow because the 13% is hidden very well and sneaks up on you a bit. Can't necessarily recommend any food pairings with this beer so I would enjoy it before or after dinner. Definitely a delicious beer so pick this up if you haven't yet. 1,193 charactersSovereignGood, Jan 11, 2016

Easy is such a generic term, but how else can I say that after taking a drink I look forward to the next one.  You would never know that this is a high ABV beer.

3.88/5  rDev -13.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4Poured from a 12oz bottle into a tulip:
Appearance: lighter on the pour than I anticipated, with a cola-like color pouring from the bottle. Little to no head, with the small amount dissipating quickly. Body in the glass is dark, dark brown, bordering on black. No carbonation visible.
Aroma: little bit of vegetal scent here. Not totally off-putting, as it's mostly covered by roastiness, chocolate and coffee, but the little bit that is there makes me worried for the taste. Overall, lots to like here-strong in the coffee department, with some chocolate and solid bitter roast scent. 
Taste: this started cold, which is when the beer was definitely at its worst in my opinion. Definitely picked up some of that vegetal, green pepper flavor which was not pleasant. After the initial touch of that though, the flavors were much nicer. The coffee flavor was not overwhelming, but subtly very good, and so was the touch of booziness. I like a little heat in imp stouts, and this was good. It got much better as it warmed as well. Stil, too much of that raw bell pepper flavor present for me to give this a 4 or more.
Feel: felt really thin for a beer that punches in at 13%. It packed a little heat too, so I was figuring this would be a mouth-coater and a sipper, but it was Porter-like in depth. It's better than a lot of stouts in this department, but still would've liked a bit more body.
Overall: I was really psyched to try this after drinking Vanilla Noir and loving it, but I didn't like it nearly as much. A very good stout, and I'd like to give a newer batch a try, but I wouldn't rank it among the elite stouts. 1,625 charactersTheElectricOne, Jan 03, 2016

4.64/5  rDev +3.6%look: 3 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I don't see any bottle date. I should also point out that my bottle does not have wax like the one depicted on this site. They must have stopped this practice.
Appearance: Black body with no head. There is a bit of a light tan film on the surface but it is only there as I pour. It then quickly fades out to nothing. There are a couple of bubbles that I could count by hand. Overall it looks average for a high ABV stout. Nothing overly impressive.
Aroma: It has a very interesting aroma. It's a mix of chocolate and very earthy spices. It smells a bit like beef jerky with some teriyaki sauce. Some alcohol makes it through but it oddly adds to the aroma. It's hard to convey...I guess it smells a bit like Bailey's Irish Cream mixed with paprika. It's very interesting and it intrigues the senses.
Taste: Wonderful chocolate flavor. Simply wonderful. It tastes like a chocolate liqueur. It's absolutely fantastic. I could sit here and talk about how I pick up faint hints of hickory or coffee and how there is this perfect balance of bitterness and sweetness that most candy bar manufacturers can't even achieve, but it would be like going to an amusement park and analyzing the food stalls when there are rollercoasters to be ridden. The chocolate flavor is fantastic. I knew going into this that the beer was made with chili peppers and that the title was "BOMB!" which I admit had me apprehensive. I can pick up some earthy flavor from the chili peppers but it is not spicy at all. The key to this beer is the wonderful chocolate flavor.
Mouthfeel: Smooth and luxurious. It is the perfect mouthfeel for this beer.
Overall: I would say this is a world-class chocolate stout. It relies heavily on the chocolate flavor to make its impression but it is a good impression. The base beer (the stout) is hidden behind this flavor but it is as good as a supporting role as any velvety voiced back-up singer I've heard. This beer gets my highest recommendation to those who enjoy chocolate stouts. 1,998 charactersteromous, Jan 03, 2016

Nice-looking, opaque, dense but vanishing head - at only 8 months, I thought head retention might be better.
Nose is chocolate-covered peppers with soft cocoa. 
Taste is coffee-soaked peppers, candied spices (like sticks of cinnamon dipped in butterscotch or something - odd but delectable), fizzy alcohol bite at the top of the mouth.  The peppers fade as it warms, while the chocolate and cocoa intensify.  "complex" is totally apt here.
Feel is very thick and smooth, the fizzy alcohol tinge clashes with the big body a bit. 545 charactersBodiesLexus, Jan 01, 2016

A - chocolate, roasted malt and chili peppers - once you smell the peppers, the aroma really takes over.
T - not a flavor, but for me the defining characteristic of this beer is warmth - it tastes and makes you feel warm - surely helped along by the 13% ABV. Has hints of dark chocolate, mild flavor from the peppers (stonger in nose), burnt brown sugar,  dark roast coffee, just gets better as you drink it
F - great body too, full, with a sweet finished, balanced by the pepper 560 charactersGuitarIPA, Jan 01, 2016

Smell is fantastic the coffee notes come strong warming to the nose slight chocolate as well.

Feel is very smooth medium body very slick going down, slight burn from the peppers and alcohol at the end.

4.5/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5L: Poured from a bottle to a pint glass. Had a jet black color and a thick consistency. There was an inch of foamy, tan-colored, fairly long-lasting head. Not a whole lot of lacing, though.
S: A warm, enticing aroma of coffee, malt, and a lot of chocolate.
T: A big flavor here, with a big shot of milk chocolate mingling with some coffee, roasted malt, vanilla, and chilis. A big, well-rounded taste that delivers fully. The ABV% is barely noticeable.
F: A good amount of carbonation with an incredibly silky smooth finish. Full-bodied.
O: This is a rightfully praised stout. It is exactly what the style should be: Big, forceful, and powerful. 649 charactersavalon07, Dec 27, 2015
4.47/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.512 ounce bottle, julian date 16215 stamped on the bottle (June 11, 2015).  Served in a Great Lakes snifter, the beer pours dark brown/black with about an inch tan head.  Head retention and lacing are both decent enough.  Aroma is nice, the brew smells like coffee, bittersweet and milk chocolate, chile peppers, and roasted malt.  I think the taste is mostly like the aroma, but there's also some caramel and vanilla noticeable.  I think the coffee, chocolate and roasty flavors are the strongest, but the ancho chile is a nice addition!  Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's creamy and coating with moderate carbonation.  The 13% ABV is well hidden, it sure doesn't seem like I'm drinking something that strong.  I thought this was pretty good, I'll have to buy some more the next time I see it!  $8.99 a bottle. 812 charactersbluejacket74, Dec 26, 2015

The flavors of the cocoa, coffee and vanilla all mix very well.  The Chili Peppers were not present while cold but slowly make an appearance as the beer warms.  The high ABV was hidden very well in this beer.  I would recommend pouring half into your glass, leaving the bottle out while drinking the first half, then drink the second after it has warmed in the bottle.  Amazing Beer! 508 characterstimmy2b, Dec 26, 2015

The cocoa and coffee and pepper were all subtler than a few others I've had (stone xocoveza comparisons arise, and I prefer that, though really they're slightly different, and I enjoyed both--this one is more boozy, more subdued on the pepper). Overall, the elements blend together well, with a bit of vanilla to perhaps soften and sweeten the alcohol heat. A winner for certain. 415 charactersbraker649er, Dec 26, 2015

While some roasted malts and hints of chili peppers come in, mostly I smell vanilla and dark chocolate.  Smooth, almost milky slick mouthfeel, probably the smoothest and easiest drinking beer that I've ever had with double digit ABV (which is incredibly well hidden).  The coffee and chili are noticeable on backend and help give beer another dimension as for most part it is real chocolaty and sweet (some vanilla in there but mostly chocolate).  This is a beer that I could keep pounding b/c of my sweet tooth but I could see why some people don't like it as it very sweet and not for fans of only dry stouts. 677 charactersclayrock81, Dec 24, 2015

Taste is complex and interesting; the cacao nibs mix with the chilis to give it almost a cinnamon flavor.

4.17/5  rDev -6.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25This was one of my more anticipated beers. Poured out dark black with very little head to it that went away almost as soon as I had set it down on the table. The scent wowed me as I really picked up vanilla and coffee. I couldn't really get much of the peppers at first, but they were in there. I got them much more in the taste, however. It wasn't as strong as I had thought it would be for a 13% ABV beer. This one seemed to be a tad more boozy than I had heard from others, but the initial coffee/chocolate hit really started this off right for me. The middle of the glass was where it hit its sweet spot for me. The flavors were mixed best by that point and honestly it was better as it warmed. It was my first experience with a high ABV Imperial Stout and first with a chili pepper blend, but it was a great first experience. Top notch beer. 846 charactersjaredsmith83, Dec 21, 2015

Taste is similar to aroma, but not as hot. Alcohol, chocolate , coffee and chili peppers. Flavor is dominated by a huge chocolate malt sweetness. Like whopper malt balls.
 A great big, chewy stout.    Price is high though at $ 9 to $10 per bottle. 423 charactersmadbrewer9, Dec 14, 2015

But it failed to live up to the hype.  Don't get me wrong, this is a great tasting beer. Especially for a stout that is much more nuanced then most others in this category.  But I will tak a four pack of Narwhal for the same price. Cheers 345 charactersRytr, Dec 13, 2015

Looked the part, brown and black, thin beige head.  Smelled of everything advertised, coffee, chocolate, peppers and vanilla.
Rich, luxurious taste and mouthfeel.   I bit pricey at almost a dollar and ounce, but its a damn good beer, there's been some batch variation to say the least the last year or so, but in its pristine form, this is an enjoyable beer, delivers the flavor without undue sweet or bitterness.   Its a solid beer.  But jeez, $60/6 pack?  C'mon man. 543 charactersrodbeermunch, Dec 10, 2015
4.24/5  rDev -5.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25I picked up a bottle of Prairie's BOMB!  a couple weeks ago for $9.99 at The Lager Mill.  I've been wanting to try this beer for a while and now that it's available where I live I knew I needed to try it, but the price is a little off putting, so lets see how it goes.  2015 Vintage.  Poured from a brown 12oz bottle into a snifter.  
A-  This label looks good, it's got a nice simple design to it and it's a little eye catching.  It poured a dark black color that didn't let any light come through and it had just a thin ring of dark tan head that died down to a thin ring that eventually faded away and it left a little bit of spotty lacing behind.  This is a good looking beer, but I wish it had a little more head and better retention.  
S-  The aroma starts off with a higher amount of medium sweetness with the malts being the first to showed up and they impart a roasted malt, slightly charred, sweet malt and big chocolate aromas with the chocolate sticking out the most and it imparts some nice dark chocolate and milk chocolate like aromas and it goes right into some coffee which is noticeable, but not too overpowering which I like.  Up next comes a light alcohol aroma that leads into the malt spices which impart a nice mixture with cinnamon sticking out the most..  This beer has a very nice aroma, it's complex and all the different aspects work well together.
T-  The taste seems to be similar to the aroma and it starts off with a higher amount of sweetness with those malts still being the first to show up and they impart the same aspects that they did in the aroma with the dark chocolate sticking out the most and in the background comes the coffee which shows up just as much as it did in the aroma.   Up next a noticeable boozy flavor, it's noticeable, but not overpowering and it's followed by the spices which impart that same mixture of spices that I got in the aroma.  On the finish there's some sweet malts with just a little bit of bitterness with a little bit of alcohol coming through in the aftertaste along with chocolate, coffee and spices. and the chili pepper shows up right at the end.  This is a very nice tasting beer, all the flavors work well together, but it's a little on the boozy side.  
M-  Fairly smooth, velvety, a little rich, not too crisp, on the lighter side of being full bodied with a medium amount of carbonation.  The mouthfeel is very nice, but the alcohol could have been hidden a little better. 
Overall I thought this was a very nice beer and I thought it was a very nice example of the style, it had everything that I was looking for in the style and no single aspect ever got to be too overpowering while retaining a good amount of complexity.  This beer had decent drinkability, one glass is the right amount of me, it might start to get too boozy after more than that.  What I like the most about this beer was the complexity and how all the different aspects worked well together.  What I liked the least about this beer is the booze, I think it could have been hidden a little better. I would buy this beer again, but only for special occasions since it's pretty pricey and I would recommend it to anyone who likes spices stouts.  All in all I really liked this beer and I was a little impressed, I don't think it's world class, but it's pretty damn good.  All in all this my new favorite beer from this brewery and it's a very nice example of the style.  Great job guys, this is one tasty beer, keep it up. 3,479 charactersStoutHunter, Dec 10, 2015

Mind, it's an impressive cocoa bomb, but I didn't get any of the roasty flavors that I expected.  I also couldn't pick up the Chile influence, although in fairness, I do like hot peppers, so maybe the chiles are there, just below my detection threshold.  Recommended if you like Hershey's syrup. 384 charactersVashonGuy, Dec 07, 2015

A: A very rich dark pour with a quickly fading caramel/beige head. 
S: WOW! very rich chocolate, with the chili peppers really coming through towards the end. Notes of coffee and vanilla are definitely prominent in this beer.
T: First sip at first reminds me of a CRUNCH bar, extremely delicious, then the chili peppers sneak up towards the end. The blend of both extreme flavors are well balanced in this beer. 
O: Fantastic beer, can't wait to try more of these beers from Prairie! Easily drinkable, different take on a Imperial Stout, definitely recommend this beer. 660 charactersRoddyMedina, Dec 05, 2015

Pours incredibly dark brown almost black with minimal caramel colored had the dissipates.
Aromas are a good deal of chili heat and roasted malt.
Taste was a nice mix of chili flavor without being too hot, and deep chocolate. Not much vanilla to speak of.
Mouthfeel was good.
Overall this beer was very good but I was expecting a bit more based on reviews. Still a nice beer. 413 charactersBoldRulerVT, Dec 04, 2015

4.32/5  rDev -3.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Pours with little visible carbonation. Tiny amount of brown head. The legs on the glass look kind of gritty, which I've found is often the sign of an overly sugary beer (although I know that not true here). It looks more like a bourbon-barrel-aged stout.
The smell is complex but balanced. There is a load of chocolate, cinnamon, and chiles, with hints of vanilla, oak, and fresh black coffee. It's sweet, spicy, and charred -- all well balanced. As it warms, a subtle earthiness also appears.
The taste follows the smell, but with a lot more chocolate upfront, and noticeable slight tingle from the chiles at the end. The coffee is present but subtle, not assertive like it would be in a full-blown coffee stout like Founders Breakfast Stout. The cinnamon and chili spice lingers at the finish, but it never builds up to a burn. The first few sips had a strange, metallic tinge, but that faded quickly.
It has a nice, soft, round feel, almost like an oatmeal stout. It look a little flat when poured, but, paradoxically, it's light on the tongue.
Overall: one of my all-time favorite non-barrel-aged stouts. With so many adjuncts, it could have become a confusing mess, but Prairie balanced everything beautifully. I would drink this beer every day if I could. 1,261 charactersccg, Dec 02, 2015

Aroma was chocolate, coffee, a hint of chile's and led directly into matching flavors. There is also some caramel sweetness involved. Let this one warm up a bit and you'll get a distinct aroma and flavor just like Hershey chocolate syrup ... but with some heat. I love the chili integration; noticeable but not overpowering. Well done. A full bodied beer that fits wonderful with or in place of dessert. 472 charactersLouZ, Nov 28, 2015

S: Thick and sweet with spicy, salty, prickly peppers mingling with assertive chocolate. The peppers yield some smoke and roastiness. Coffee is definitely present but the vanilla much more subtle. Earthy, decadent, delightful.
T: Coffee, caramel, and cacao dominate. A tad earthy and herbaceous with the ancho chilis. Vanilla and some perceptible alcohol. Finish is only semi-sweet and mildly bitter. This is one balanced big beer.
F: Medium-full body, very slick mouthfeel, very moderate carbonation. A touch of heat from the peppers and booze, definitely welcomed but ridiculously tame for such a high abv.
O: One of the best beers I've reviewed in a long time. So many excellent flavors going on, great use of chili peppers, and smooth as a baby’s ass. This is one of those beers that isn’t objectively cheap, but is well worth the price tag given the quality. 971 charactersthepenguin, Nov 27, 2015

Smell: Very boozy on the nose. Chocolate and some chili. No coffee that I can detect.
Taste: initially dark chocolate with a hint of sweetness. I'm getting a meld of dark chocolate and vanilla in the middle.  The first hint of the pepper comes in.  Back of the palate sees a diminishing, but not disappearance of the chocolate and vanilla.  Heat comes in here, but is not overwhelming.  There is a slight burn going down the throat.  Lovely.
Mouthfeel: very thick!  Again, to be expected.
Overall:  a great beer when viewed alone. Honestly, a bit of a letdown compared to Bible Belt.  That said, this is still a great beer.  Many complain of too much chili pepper in some of these beers, but I'd have like to see a bit more.  Outstanding. 799 charactersjohnnybgood1999, Nov 25, 2015

Smell- Vanilla, slight chocolate, coffee with a hint of peppers.
Taste- Tons of Vanilla up-front fading to coco and chilis.  The pepper is subtle if you sip the beer but a larger swig results in a bit more burn.
Finish- Balanced and smooth, so smooth that you barely notice the heat that is often times associated with a 14%ABV beverage. 487 charactersDaileyg13, Nov 23, 2015

Pours a deep dark black body with the thinnest amount, if any at all, of head on top. 
Aromas of chocolate and coffee and vanilla...Duh, right?!  Mouth watering immediately!!
Taste....ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?!  WOW!  So balanced with all the adjuncts.  Chocolate and vanilla and coffee right away, a little amount of heat from the peppers on the end.  Just great!
Full mouth feel not a hint of alcohol heat, 13% abv...seiously?!  Where?  D-A-N-G-E-R-O-U-S!
Overall, so worth the $8.99 price tag for a 12 oz. bottle, which I have always said I wouldn't spend, but...Had to do it when I saw this one available!  So much going on with this one all the flavors just compliment each other and follow each other like a 1, 2, 3 punch!  If you find this...PICK IT UP!  Nothing disappointing about this one at all! 864 charactersjhartley, Nov 23, 2015

It jumps off the glass with vanilla and cacao, even hits of dark fruits and cherries somewhere. Love the flavors that come out while sipping although I'd like a little more sweetness. Just a personal preference the bitterness of the cacao seems to take over a lot. 
Drank from a bottle aged a year old. 365 charactersjvivino, Nov 22, 2015

A - Jet black. Little to no head, with just a thin dark tan lace that is short lived.
S -  Heavy coffee, cocoa, roasted malts. 
T - Woah. Chocolate, coffee, sweetness, and a touch of peppery zing on the finish. Heat is well hidden. Hints of smoke. This is good.
M - Smooth. Carbonation is low, but there is enough to hold it together.  Will it get sticky? It gets a touch sticky late.
O - Impressed with this  one (which is good based on the price for a single). A slow sipper, will be seeking this out again. 598 charactersApellonious, Nov 21, 2015

Leaves absolutely no lacing. Looks like 100% opaque black water in my pint glass; I'm okay with this. Smell is of very dark chocolate and hints of coffee. Taste is rich, roasty, and sweet chocolate. The chili profile comes through very subtly on the backend. Would have liked an even greater chili profile but I find elegance in its subtly. Mouth feel is deceptively light. Whoa dare I say this beer is.. Refreshing. Akin to a mocha iced coffee with a greater buzz. The booze is masked completely quite a feat at 13%. This beer is full of character and surprises.

Aromas of coffee and cocoa most apparent, I guess something of a vanilla around the chocolate... Went right for a sip. The chocolaty character has an almost boozy edge, and I'm gonna attribute that to the vanilla bean influence for sure. Sweet (too sweet?) espresso rounds out the palate, with just a hint at some chili heat. The body was flat, much thinner than I expected for a beer with this kinda billing; a little sticky, and a tingle on the roof of my mouth from the chili's heat. I was not blown away, but I am partial to a much bigger body on an imperial stout like this. It was also a little much on the sweet side for me - but these are personal preferences. I'd still recommend it. 803 charactersGreywulfken, Nov 15, 2015

Yes the coffee and chocolate are there but absolutely no vanilla and not enough pepper spice at all.  Its also WAY too sweet IMO...more like a milk stout then an imperial.  Feel is very thin and flat. Alcohol is well hidden for 13% but just too sweet, thin and flat for all the hype. 515 charactersRoland7792, Nov 14, 2015

For one, it's getting cold tonight, so hello to my 13% alcohol friend! Also, I'm ready for nightcap. And finally, I think the beer's name serves as a connection to those who served in the military (this being Veterans Day). From a stubby 12 ounce bottle, on to the beer:
A short ring of slightly tanned lace rings around the glass of this ink black double stout. Otherwise, head retention is nil. With a few sniffs of the aroma, I develop the impression that the smell of BOMB! is a very good one. I get the smooth coffee notes, spicy chiles, vanilla and chocolate, and smelling very nice. 
Full boded and flavorful, this double stout doesn't pussyfoot around. The spicy chiles pair with oxidized double stout chocolate and get this thing rolling in the right direction. Vanilla and coffee flex their muscles and join the ride. Spicy chiles throughout, so if you don't like your beer spiced, you best leave those BOMB! bottles on the shelf. As for the 13% alcohol,it is wearing a disguise that very few beers can match. Full bodied and lightly carbonated, the beer is best sipped but could be consumed at a faster pace. Chocolate, chiles, and oxidation linger in the aftertaste. 
BOMB! has certainly earned its stripes. The chiles really make this stout stand out from the common one, so whenever I go into a spicy mood again, I would definitely have it again. An easier to find alternative to the coveted Huanahpu. 1,564 charactersDoubleJ, Nov 12, 2015

Mouth-feel is a tad thin but really not bad at all but I like a thicker feel in a big stout like this.  Overall this is an incredible beer.

Looks like an imperial stout, though not motor oil like some. Some sparse foam rings the glass. Looks a bit flat (but it isn't).
Nose is big coffee, dark fruit, burnt sugar
Taste follows the nose, roasty coffee, but with more chili spice, a little dark chocolate, some brown sugar sweetness on the sides of the tongue. Sweetens up as it warms, but never gets cloying.
Mouthfeel is oily slick, hot and a little prickly but somehow not off-putting in any way, it works. The chili's give the impression of taking up the cause for the scorch, and not the alcohol, so it just feels right. 
Drier than some big stouts, very balanced sweet, spicy, smoky, bitter. All around just a deeply complex and quaffable imperial stout. Want a comparison? KBS with chilies - all the way. 845 charactersdoucmehu, Nov 08, 2015

4.51/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured for my 100th beer review. 
Jet black with 1/2 of a rich caramel colored head.
Aroma is exactly what is boasts! Absolutely delicious smelling beer! Tons of toasty coffee and unsweetened cocoa. The vanilla is a bit overshadowed by the roasted notes, but the chili comes through briefly at the end. 
Taste is disappointing for me. At such a high abv and with so much hype, I was hoping for near perfection. It's good, but not fantastic. Coffee and cocoa are prevalent upfront. Love the roasted notes. A Molasses-like sweetness is present near the middle of the mouth. For the finale, I definitely get the gentle pepper spice as the beer warms. I also get a very slight trace of an iron/metallic note. Mouthfeel is thick, but the most disappointing part of this beer is the LOW carbonation. It detracts from the overall fantastic feel of the beer. Alcohol is hardly noticeable.
Overall good beer, but not fantastic nor worth any extensive searching or trading for. I enjoyed the chili heat at the end, which is definitely unique. I see it pairing with a fresh baked brownie with a  coffee and chili infused gelato. It gets a 90/100. 1,139 charactersDaverCS, Nov 08, 2015

Inky black color with a smallish short lived bubbly tan head. Coffee, chocolate, molasses, dried dark fruits, hints of peppers, vanilla and roast. Yeah this one is pretty damn good and hides the alcohol wonderfully! Need more. 307 charactersjohnnnniee, Nov 07, 2015
4.8/5  rDev +7.1%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75I've wanted to try this for some time.  The price always made me think twice, but I took the plunge.
L; Standard Stout, very dark black/brown, I'm getting no light at all.  Even after an aggressive pour it's pretty flat.  Not really any lacing to speak of.  Still this looks appealing.
S; Wow, very complex and it gets more so as it warms.  Chocolate, coffee, vanilla, booze, sweet roasted malts and chili.  The vanilla lessens as it warms and the chili seems to get stronger.
T; Double Wow.  A symphony of flavors.  Rich chocolate to start, slipping into vanilla, with coffee bitterness lurking on the outside.  It finishes with a hint of the chili, slightly warm, just right.  For a 14% bruiser, the alcohol from the nose is pretty well hidden.  It's there, just well concealed with the other flavors.
F; It does seem pretty flat, but does have a very creamy element.  Quite chewy, in fact as thick as any brew I've had.  Flavors linger with a light burn from the chili being the longest lasting sensation.  It goes from a sticky feel to dry (no doubt the 14%).
O;  Worth every penny, a pleasure to drink.  I'll treat myself to this at special occasions going forward.  Prairie Bomb is the bomb! 1,197 charactersSFNC, Nov 07, 2015

Pours the expected black with pretty much no head and no lacing... Actually looks flat. Nose is thick fresh coffee beans and lesser cocoa and vanilla.. Not getting much in the way of chili... Flavor mirrors the aroma perfectly with a touch of sweetness to tie everything together... I get a touch of chili flavor and then a flash of heat right on the finish, but in thankfully doesn't collect and get "hot". Very complex and one of the best RIS I've had in a while. Thick on the palate but carbonation is woefully low... Blind, I would have guessed Alan Sprints made this beer. :-P

Chocolate and roasty malts. Dark fruit, vanilla
Great balance of flavors...Bittersweet chocolate and vanilla sweetness.  Some dark fruit and coffee. Slight hint of pepper on finish
Silky smooth, body is on the heavier side of medium but not what I'd expect from a 13% beer. Don't know how they did it but its splendid. Lower in carb, exactly what I want in the style
This is a fantastic, well made beer. Prob overpriced at 10 a pop but I'd pick this up again when I feel like treating myself 566 charactersmaxcoinage, Nov 06, 2015

4.33/5  rDev -3.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Poured from 12oz bottle with a wispy head that dissipated quickly.  There is very little carbonation.  The aroma has a strong chocolate note and little sign of the booze expected with the high abv.  The taste is interesting and complex.  It starts with a rich french roast coffee and finishes with a subtle chili pepper bite.  This is one of the more restrained uses of peppers that I have tasted.  The combination of flavors resembles bourbon.
This is a one of a kind beer that is worthy of the hype. 502 charactersNctide, Nov 03, 2015

Look: Black as night, no light shines through. Thin head, but dissipated quickly.
Smell: No heat from the peppers or booze. Vanilla, Coffee, Chocolate. I wouldnt mind an ice cream topping that smells like this.
Taste:
Cold: Vanilla overwelms the entire beer. Overwhelms might be the wrong word, because its really enjoyable.
Warm: Chocolate, Vanilla and Coffee blend together, with heat that lingers on the taste of your tongue.
Feel: Great, smooth. For being 13 Percent, it doesnt show it at all. I am in love.
Overall: perfection. I wish it was a little bit cheeper, but its an amazing beer that I will be buying more of for special occasions... I think I will buy one or two for christmas to share at a family party. 768 charactersMgoJohnStamos, Nov 01, 2015

4.58/5  rDev +2.2%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a chestnut brown color, opaque in the glass with a roasted khaki head that dissipates to a ring of medium sized light tan bubbles.  Lots of sweet milk chocolate fudge, vanilla bean, bold gourmet espresso,  nougat, maple syrup, caramel machiatto creamer, Hershey's chocolate syrup,  candied rum, some woodiness.  I was searching for the chili pepper heat but couldn't find any in the smell.  Big mouth feel, very sweet, borderline cloying, but forgiving.  It could use a little more carbonation.  The pepper comes in very faintly in the taste, just not with the spicy heat that I was expecting.  More rich cocoa in the taste, vanilla, brown sugar, sweet coffee, marshmallow, pepper skin, cinnamon, graham cracker, and some dark, candied fruit.  No alcohol burn for a relatively fresh 13%  beer.  I had Bible Belt last year, which I remember to possess much more roasty charred malts, whereas this one tries to present itself as a smooth liquid dessert.  I just would have liked to get a little bit more heat out of this one. 1,029 charactersCzarkazm, Oct 28, 2015

Smells of huge chocolate and vanilla, some roasty barley notes, hint of coffee and caramel.
Taste is very well balanced between all of the components, though I'm not getting much of the chili pepper. Vanilla, Coffee, Chocolate are all present, but none are dominant. Lots of roasty, dark malt notes as well. A bit of toffee and a hint of dark fruit.
Very slick on the mouth. Does not feel like 13%.
Very good beer that isn't far off from being an amazing beer. 513 characterstrevorpost, Oct 26, 2015
4.15/5  rDev -7.4%look: 3.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.2512oz bottle purchased at Huckleberry’s in Spokane for $10.99. Among the numbers stamped on the neck is “20815.” August 20, 2015 born on-date? Your guess is as good as mine.
Poured into a St. Bernardus goblet, this was a blackish looking color that yielded a slightly muddy shade of darkness when held up to direct light. What head there was had a tannish khaki look and was whisper-thin and short-lived. A twirl of the glass briefly created sheets of lace, but they fled at the speed of a Grand Wizard at a rap concert. I didn’t expect much out of a 13% beer, but it was a pretty sad looking display of beer foam nonetheless.
The nose was dark, sweet and (especially) boozy at first. The sweetness of the cocoa and vanilla variety did emerge in greater volume as it warmed up, especially the vanilla, but it continued to smell like a woody booze bomb.
Whoa! Holy fermented liquid chocolate cream pie! Actually that pretty well describes it. It’s much better balanced than in the nose. The vanilla is much more in check for one thing (I’ve come to feel that a little vanilla goes a long way in beer – usually too far). It starts out chocolaty sweet, but the bourbon barrel booze and wood comes through in the second half of the taste. The chili peppers took a while to register, but eventually came to stand out near the finish of the taste. I like that there's just enough to provide a little flavor rather than impersonate the name of the beer, flattening everything else (like most brewers seem to do with chili peppers). One thing I didn’t get much of was coffee, except in a generic, dark malty bitterness way that I’ve found in beers with no coffee whatever in them. Still, it’s delicious, though I’m really glad I was able to get it in the 12oz format. A bomber of this would really be too much of a good thing. 
It looked a little watery when I poured it, but the body is actually quite full, with a creamy, coating, velvety mouthfeel.
I was initially underwhelmed by the look and aroma of this beer but I gave it a little time to warm and was rewarded. I don’t know if I can call this the greatest of the style that I’ve had but it’s in the discussion. If it was only cheaper and a little more commonly found locally, I could see myself stocking up on it. As it is, I think I need to locate at least one more and set it aside to see how it ages. 2,386 characterswoemad, Oct 25, 2015

Pours dark as night, really no color is coming out of it even on the edges (not the best lighting ever for this search but the white computer screen should give me a hint).  I didn't get a lot of head from the pour, but the beer coats the glass with lacing and carbonated legs with any movement.  Really one of the better looking stouts if you're into beer porn I suppose.  
The nose is of coffee and pepper notes jumping out of a dark malt and chocolate body.  A part of me is a bit iffy on what to expect given I generally do not like chili powder in anything, especially stouts.  
Roasted coffee with a bit of a pepper kick over chocolate.  it's really interesting how the prices seem to be an experience separate from the beer.  I could focus on the beer and I'd almost ignore them or I can focus on the spice/coffee and get that.  It's a really unique duality of beer going on here.  
Well carbonated and a big body yet for some reason it has something off on the mouth feel.  
Really really great beer and fully deserving of the praise.  Thankfully also a pretty easy beer to get now days. 1,164 charactersbobhits, Oct 24, 2015
4.47/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.512 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 8/4/2015. Pours dense pitch black color with a small dense dark tan head with good retention, that reduces to a thin lace cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a light amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, vanilla, toffee, molasses, chili pepper, toast, dark bread, light dark fruit/smoke/char, and herbal/roasted earthiness. Incredible aromas with fantastic complexity and balance of dark/roast/bready malt, chili pepper, and coffee/vanilla/cocoa spice notes; with great strength. Taste of huge dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, vanilla, toffee, molasses, chili pepper, toast, dark bread, light dark fruit/smoke/char, and herbal/roasted earthiness. Moderate amount of pepper spice and roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, vanilla, toffee, molasses, chili pepper, toast, dark bread, light dark fruit/smoke/char, and herbal/roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt chili pepper, and coffee/vanilla/cocoa spice flavors; with a great roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light carbonation and very full bodied; with a smooth, creamy, fairly sticky/chalky, and slightly slick mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warmth lingering after the finish. Very minimal heat from the actual peppers as well. Overall this is an incredible spiced imperial stout style. All around fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt, chili pepper, and coffee/vanilla/cocoa spice flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the huge ABV. A highly amazing offering as expected. 1,789 characterssuperspak, Oct 24, 2015

All I can say is wow.  Pours jet black with an eighth inch of dark brown head.  Nose is coffee, dark chocolate, toffee, caramel, fruit.  A lot going on.  Taste is that dark chocolate, roasted malts on the front.  Finish is that big coffee punch in the face.  There's something else on the finish that is probably the ancho chili. Feel is viscous.  Booze is noticeable, but not in a bad way.  Overall, an outstanding non-BBA imperial stout.  Happy to see this all over SoCal right now. 579 charactersLADaveBN, Oct 19, 2015

Coffee is the first flavor on the palette followed quickly by the pepper and chocolate. Flavors are not as understated and refined as Mexican Cake but definitely a close second if only by a whisker. Will drink again and again. 281 charactersMtg711, Oct 18, 2015

4.19/5  rDev -6.5%look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25L-Black with no light transference. An aggressive pour leads to a chocolate half centimeter head which quickly recedes to a thin ring and no lacing.
S-Coffee is the dominant aroma with some chocolate evident in the back end.
T-Coffee punches you in the face up front, but subsides and dark chocolate takes over in the middle. The chilies are obscured until the very end and provide a pleasant warming finish. I detect no vanilla or alcohol.
F-Thick and viscous as a good stout should be. Carbonation is light and appropriate for the style.
O-The coffee flavor was a little strong for me at first, but my palate adjusted and I found myself enjoying this beer. The Chile aspect is well done and is a nice level which adds, but does not dominate the flavor profile. My only complaint is that the Vanilla was obscured by the coffee, but again it's a minor quibble. I enjoyed this beer an although the price point is higher than I would like for a 12 oz. bottle, I'd happily drink it again. 985 charactersNotAlcoholicJustAHobby, Oct 18, 2015

This FINE imperial pours a thick and rich black with dark brown highlights and a thin dissipating dark bronw head that settles to a thin ring and light lacing.  Nose of heavy dark chocolate, spicy roasted peppers, dark rich coffee, and deeply roasted malts.  Flavors exceed the nose with dark fudge and espresso on the front and sides, a light vanilla note comes in on the back, and a rich roasted ancho spice livens up the overall heaviness of the stout.  Slick, coating, chewy, and lightly carbonated----a stout drinkers imperial stout with a sweet complex finish of spice and sweet.  Exceptional.

S - Woody, caramel, prunes, chocolate, coffee, smoky, plums, raisins and other dark fruits.
T - Alcohol and hop presence are both noticeable, but bitterness is restrained.  Hops taste a bit sprucey.  Malt flavor is caramel, prunes, roasted chocolate and coffee with a slight metallic hint.      
M - Mouth coating with a fairly long finish of +30 seconds.
O - Awesome beer.  Love the thick feel and rich flavors. 542 characterssilverblaze540, Oct 17, 2015

3.04/5  rDev -32.1%look: 5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 2.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 2Really wanted to like this. Waited to pair this with food that met some of its ingredients. My sis in law made some ice cream sandwiches with chilles in the cookie figured this would pair well. It would have, but I didn’t expect the strength of the coffee. Anyways.. Appearance- looks good pitch black. Smell- again fine. Coffee coming out though. Taste- with all the other favors it boasts all that really showed up was the coffee. Disappointed. A little heat in the back end from the chilles. No vanilla beans or cocoa nibs like I was hoping. M- felt fine on the tongue and nice to drink. Alcohol taste was discreet. Overall- just maybe trade your other one if the opportunity arises. You don’t like coffee and have had other coffee tasting beers that tasted better than this one anyway. Nice to try it, but let me down. 826 charactersNoYouDidnt, Oct 09, 2015
4.3/5  rDev -4%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25BOD 167/15.  Pitch black pour.  Normal head volume, poor retention and very poor lacing even though it's 13% ABV.
World class rich nose of dark chocolate, coffee and caramel with hints of vanilla.  As it warms, vanilla comes much more forward.
 Medium body with a smooth texture that approaches creamy. Normal carbonation with a slight bit of effervescence in the middle and a fair burst in the finish.  
The flavor profile approaches world class.  It is very intense, complex and not well balanced.  The pepper aspect becomes overpowering on what otherwise would be a world class profile.  It begins with a blend of coffee and chocolate that slowly allows a rich caramel base to emerge.  The moderately bitter middle is comprised of coffee, roast and hops over a rising heat and vanilla.  As the finish approaches a combined heat of pepper and alcohol dominates.  The finish is dry.  Alcohol and pepper heat lingers in the somewhat astringent finish. 954 characterstillmac62, Oct 09, 2015
4.84/5  rDev +8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Tried this one on draft at a local beer shop. 
L- Poured dark as night, nearly no head to speak of, but left a ring of dark tan residual bubbles laced around the edge of the glass while drinking. 
S- Dark chocolate coffee, with definite vanilla notes.
T- Intense coffee, very substantial cacao, a nice amount of vanilla. And sweet. But not too sweet. A slight hint of pepper to give it a little bit of a kick. Not overpowering at all, blends very well with the other flavors. Places this beer on a higher level in the taste department. I would not call it spicy. More like mild sauce, but I love spicy food and can drink tabasco sauce straight from the bottle. So take that for what you will. 
F - Definitely not the most carbonated, but it's not intended to be. Some people knock this beer for being flat. Maybe it's just because I had the pleasure of trying it fresh on draft, but this beer definitely had some slight carbonation to it. Some have said no head at all, and It was very slight for me not really much to speak of, but the overall feel going down was smooth, soft, and warm. It was not flat. The peppers were a pleasant addition.
O - This is how I like my stouts. For those who don't like vanilla or chocolate. Stay away. If you can't handle the slightest bit of heat. It's not for you. If you don't like high gravity espresso beers, then stay away from beverages with chest hair. In fact, stay away from Imp Stouts in general.
If you like malty, coffee, chocolatey, vanilla, with a hint of pepper...
damn near perfect.
I'll be heading back to buy some bottles.
It's the BOMB! 'Nuff said. 1,609 charactersjoefretty, Oct 09, 2015

$8.99 single poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint. Site says 14% ABV, but my batch is 13%. Looks like the bottle says this was bottled 2/16 -- having it 10/4. 
Appearance: Pouring this straight out of the fridge down the middle into my glass, I expected something, but got nothing. Absolutely no head came up at all. At the very end there were a few bubbles that came up and ultimately left a ring around the glass though. The color is a predictable pitch black. It looks "whatever", but... whatever. (3.75/5)
Smell: My first thought is most definitely coffee beans: there is more coffee in the aroma of this beer than some of the self-proclaimed coffee beers out there. The cacao nibs added gives a mocha vibe to the overall smell too, with only a little bit of vanilla bean. I don't smell any chili peppers, but I didn't think I would over all of the coffee that's in this beer. The label says "...aged on coffee, cacao nibs, vanilla beans, and chili peppers", and I would say the potency of each ingredient is in that order. Despite the very high ABV, I don't smell any alcohol, amazingly enough. I get the feeling that it's a high ABV just because of the intensity of the aroma, but BOMB! certainly isn't a booze bomb. This is simply one of the best beers I've ever smelled. It's pretty much perfect. (5/5)
Taste/feel: Most definitely one of the most intense beers I've ever had. Coffee all the way through the sip on this one with the chocolate flavors underlying that. The finish is a very slight chili pepper burn on the tongue and in the back of the throat with a mellow vanilla flavor to contrast it. The slight chili pepper warmth may be mistaken as an alcohol heat by some, but the mild, lingering burn proves otherwise. Maybe I'm just becoming much too immune to the taste of alcohol, but I find that, even at 13%, the alcohol is subtle in the flavor of this beer. Obviously, I can feel it -- BOMB! dries up the tongue immediately after every sip, and my belly immediately feels warm. The feel of this beer is interesting in that I find it goes in thin, but becomes thicker on the tongue. The body could use a little bit of work to add a little "heft" just because I'm finding myself drinking this beer a little too fast for comfort, despite the mild after-burn at the end of each sip. (4.5/5, 4/5)
BOMB! is worth the hype without a doubt. I can see why some people may be turned off by it because of its huge presence of coffee, but I absolutely love it, especially with the accenting ingredients. What I find strange are those who think this beer is too spicy hot... I love spicy food, but I would still call the spice from BOMB! very mild, or mild at worst. BOMB! is a great, extremely rare example of a standard Imperial Stout (along with AleSmith's Speedway Stout) that I'm not so sure could actually be better when aged in a barrel. Other than the "blah" appearance and slightly disappointing mouthfeel (if I can even call the feel disappointing), BOMB! is one of the best Imperial Stouts I've had, and is one that is more than worth seeking out.

4.72/5  rDev +5.4%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.75Poured into a Firestone Walker snifter.  Pours pitch black with very little visible carbonation. After the pour a tiny band of bubble visible around the glass. Aroma is a wow experience. Rich dark toasted malt, dark quality chocolate, vanilla and light coffee; at the end of the sniff, a slight pepper burn. All the ingredients are on display. Flavor is dark chocolate, sweet dark toasted malt, vanilla, molasses; finishes with an interesting dry toffee flavor melded to mild hot peppers, which leave a light burn in the aftertaste. Creamy medium to heavy bodied with light carbonation despite the lack of bubble in the glass. Very rich and decadent. In the flavor, like the aroma, all the ingredients are represented as clear notes, but all work well together. ABV dangerously covered, but this is so full of flavor, it is a slow sipper anyway. A world class chocolate and hot pepper stout. Really excellent. Now on my desert island list, this would make a boring day special. 977 charactersLiquidAmber, Sep 27, 2015
4.61/5  rDev +2.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Pours pitch black color with a 1 finger foamy tan head that was full of tiny bubbles that were popping so fast that the dissipating head looked like it was moving; faded slow to average time, leaving very good foamy spotting lacing coating the sides. 
Smells of rich dark chocolate, fresh ground coffee beans, burnt coffee grinds, vanilla, chili pepper, cocoa powder, charred wood, roasted malts, mineral water, molasses, maple syrup, peat moss or earthy notes, and some alcohol like a strong booze. The initial whiff/blast that hit my nose was dark chocolate, burnt coffee grinds and chili pepper, and those seem to be the dominant notes that bookend the aroma a close it out. The charred and smoky elements are always striking, but the big 3 drive the ship. The nose matches the description on the bottle perfectly, very well done.
Tastes very similar to the way it smells with the first wave of dark chocolate, burnt coffee grinds and chili pepper hitting and clearing the way for a combo of vanilla, cocoa powder, espresso, toffee or Heath Bar, charred wood, roasted malts, Hershey's chocolate syrup, molasses, maple syrup, peat moss or earthy notes, some alcohol like a strong booze such as bourbon or whiskey, and then a blast of heat from the chili peppers. The booze and chili pepper combo is not painful, but the 13% ABV warms up your stomach real quick as it brings out what seems like barrel aging components. A lot more of the brown sugar, chocolate, vanilla, coffee and chili pepper complexities come out as it warms up. Like the nose, the flavor matches the description on the bottle perfectly, so you get what you expect as stated right under "BOMB!" - extremely well done, and I'm not a huge fan of chili pepper infused beers.
Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth but thick and chewy at the same time, with mellow carbonation, a body that is heavy and full of charred, boozy, spicy notes which fades off complex and on the dry side. This went down a tad bit easier than the Westbrook Mexican Cake, and any fan of that brew will love this.
I love stouts, especially imperial stouts, but don't necessarily dig the chili pepper beers, but just like Mexican Cake this was a great unique beer experience which exceeded my expectations and really defines what the craft beer movement is all about. A lot of fun to drink with it's massive extremes and dynamic flavors, this has a great combo of char, malts, spices and chocolatey sweetness - if you love stouts and love spicy food than this is well worth the $10 for a 12 oz bottle. A world class slow sipper that lived up to the hype. 2,592 charactersCHickman, Sep 27, 2015

4.56/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Re-Rating after aging for 3 months.
Look: Pours black - a one finger brown head that diminishes rather quickly.
Aroma: Coffee and sweet vanilla - the chili peppers and chocolate come through more after 3 months
Taste:  Dark chocolate, coffee, vanilla - a very slight minimal chili pepper heat after 3 months.
Feel: Medium body. Slightly silky. Low-medium carbonation
Overall: I was told not to let this beer age and to drink it as soon as possible after purchase. After trying one right after purchase, and again trying one after 3 months, I prefer waiting. I think if you really want the heat from the chili peppers (as is labeled on the bottle) you should wait for those 3 months. My original rating was 4.35. 712 charactersAntg8989, Sep 24, 2015

Jet black with a nice brown head that leaves lacing throughout. Coffee and vanilla are the most prevalent on the nose. The taste makes this beer one of the most incredible that I've had. I think it surpasses BCBS for me (which isn't easy to do). The only knock I have on this beer is the very slight alcohol burn that lingers for a few seconds. I bought an extra that I plan on cracking open in a year or two... the age on it might make this a perfect 5 for me. Quite possibly the best stout I've had. 568 charactersScottyTheBeerGuy, Sep 24, 2015

The vanilla beans stay with you as a lingering flavor as well. It has a full rich mouth feel with a heavy thick body.

L:Black and thick looking beer with a light brown head. S: roasty, slightly boozy, mildly sweet, coffee and chocolate, with a vegetative smell that isn't off putting but interesting (I didn't know there were chilies in this beer until afterward). T: even better than the nose, much more balanced than I was expecting. I'm usually not a huge fan of coffee stouts because I'm sensitive to the stale, "diner" coffee flavor and aroma, but immediately appreciated how subdued all the flavor additions were balanced. My favorites were the cocoa nibs and the vanilla which for me came a few seconds after the initial surge of coffee. Didn't pick up much of the chili besides a small sort of organic compoundy taste, but it wasn't off putting at all. Alcohol flavor is very well hidden and integrated into the other flavors. F: big and syrupy, which is to be expected. O: delicious and huge beer, with balance, yet enough flavor complexity to keep you interested the whole glass through. 1,037 charactersChristoffer91, Sep 22, 2015

A – Black pour with a dark brown head that settles down. Looks like liquid chocolate.

The flavors, particularly from the adjuncts, were outstanding, and impressively balanced: so much coffee, chocolate, vanilla, and pepper, but without overdoing any one of them.  The flaw was in the feel, the overall experience.  The body was very substantial and syrupy, incredibly so; but the low carbonation, and maybe some lack of hop bite, left it feeling flabby, almost a little stale.  This is a special beer, but I feel it could be even better. 559 charactersEdwardAbbey, Sep 20, 2015

I love how spicy (yet restrained) it seems, and yet the dark chocolate is so damn rich. Flavor wise, it follows the nose beautifully, only with greater touches of roast and coffee. The finish has a gentle spiciness and a touch of vanilla. It's complex, nuanced, and subtle - utterly miraculous for a big, adjunct laden imperial stout. There's no alcohol presence, yet the finish is respectably dry. It's a big, intense monster that's balanced and even delicate. And that, that's what beer is all about.

They're sometimes just too heavy / cloying on my palate.  But this particular Ale, was actually not so bad.  It has a lot flavors I love about stouts - nuttiness, chocolate, coffee.  But this wasn't too sweet or heavy on the palate.  
I drank only a 12 oz bottle of this beer.  But if you're a lightweight, you may definitely want to consider sharing a bottle with another person. 444 charactersiheartmyTHO, Sep 12, 2015

A: Pours thick and black. Doesn't let ant light through.  1/2 a finger of head that dissipates to a ring
S: smells like what a Sunday morning should smell like-Roasty coffee 
T: Roasted coffe with just a hint of Cocolate.  As it warms the chilli becomes more pronounced.  Getting a hint of vanilla towards the end.  
MF: this beer tastes so thick I feel like I should chew it.  Even though it is 13%, there is no alcohol burn
O: Tremendous beer.  Outstanding use of coffee and the right amount of chillies.   This beer is a homerun. 611 charactersSammyJaxxxx, Sep 11, 2015
4.71/5  rDev +5.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Black color with slight mahogany around the edges. Pours with very little head and slight lacing. Chocolate and coffee are upfront in the nose, cigar, burnt sugar as well. Lots of caramel in the taste especially after it warms. Heavy alcohol and not quite as bitter as I was expecting. The coffee and chocolate are certainly present but do not overpower a rather mild and pleasant sweetness that accompanies the alcohol presence. The chillies are present but don't kick you in the face, leaving a slight residual warmth. 520 charactersPhigg1102, Sep 11, 2015

Smells strongly of coffee, with some chili peppers, and cocoa.The taste has an initial hit of coffee that is very robust as it rolls into smooth cocoa. The chili peppers become more noticeable the more you drink. Vanilla is present but not prodominent. Medium body and medium carbonation. Smooth mouthfeel overall but just a tad boozey.
Equal to the hype it receives. 420 charactersBeer_Nye, Sep 04, 2015

Smells strongly of coffee, cocoa, chili peppers, and vanilla.  The taste has the same profile, but with less pronounced coffee and more cocoa.  The chili pepper heat builds as you drink.  Not as much vanilla in the flavor.  Also not a strong roasted malt presence like other IS's.  Above average body and medium carbonation.  Smooth mouthfeel.  Definitely one of the best adjunct IS's out there; it's the bomb! 508 charactersalarmclock314, Sep 02, 2015

Smells of coffee, chocolate, sweet malt, alcohol, slight roasted malt, and a hint of yeast.  Fits the style of an American Double / Imperial Stout.  Mouth feel is sharp and clean, with an average carbonation level.  Tastes of strong caramel, sweet malt, roasted malt, chocolate, slight coffee, alcohol, and toffee.  Overall, weak appearance, but great aroma, body, blend, and complexity.  It is like drinking an alcoholic chocolate turtle! 529 charactersTone, Sep 01, 2015

Pours a beautiful jet black. Smells like black coffee, bitter chocolate, milk chocolate, though I'm not detecting any of the claimed vanilla. Taste reflects the smell, dark coffee, milk chocolate, hot cocoa like flavors though again I'm not tasting any of the vanilla or chili pepper aspects. The mouthfeel is thick and chewy, with minimal carbonation that works with the thicker mouthfeel and big flavors. Overall, this is a very good stout with great coffee and chocolate characteristics. I would buy this regularly if it wasn't so darn expensive. 596 charactersReema, Aug 31, 2015

Look - black, very little foam head.
Smell - Espresso and coffee are very strong.
Taste - follows the smell, but vanilla and cocoa are unmistakable.  
Feel - extremely smooth for abv this high.  No hint of boozyness or anything that would indicate a high level of alcohol.
Overall - a very solid stout that has many of it's ingredients obviously present throughout the drink.  A dangerously smooth brew with a high abv. 464 characterseifster82, Aug 24, 2015

4.25/5  rDev -5.1%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Pours a deep and slick motor oil black with a surprisingly sturdy finger of light khaki foam.
Strong aroma of chocolate, coffee, vanilla, roast, and a subtle hint of spice.
Sticky sweet chocolate and vanilla flavor accompanied by bitter coffee and roasted malts, the sweetness is settled out by the subtle spiciness that washes over the tongue on the back end of the sip to prep the palate for another sip.
Heavy-bodied, medium carbonation, rich, smooth, and slightly spicy.
Overall, I am not generally a fan of the use of chili peppers in beers, but this was very well put together. In my experience, most brewers go crazy with the peppers and the spice overpowers everything else, but the heat that accompanies this brew is subtle and enjoyable. 751 characterslarryarms847, Aug 23, 2015

It's like a wine that's too young - many distinct strong tastes that don't form a cohesive whole. It will probably get better in a few years but its so out of balance now I can't give it a great review  If I were to rate it on the current taste I would give it a 3. 345 charactersNife, Aug 23, 2015

Smell is a chocolatey, coffee-laden spice bomb; aromas of cinnamon, red pepper, nutmeg, and allspice.
Taste is absolutely awesome: chocolate, coffee, roasted grains and malt duel with red pepper and spices: cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, and grains-of-paradise are distinguishable. Rich dark-fruit flavors of prunes, raisins, and cherries fight through more spice on the mid-palate, with yet more spices, chocolate, and coffee on the finish.  Mouthfeel is appropriately rich, with spot-on, creamy carbonation. Of all the flavored stouts I've had, this might well be the best. 658 charactersVikingBeer, Aug 22, 2015

Pours really dark, thick looking, no light passing through this one.  No head, oily cling coats the glass.  The smell is wonderful, one of the best I can remember.  Strong cacao, vanilla, coffee, even the chilies all come through clearly.  Also malt and a great malted milk ball aroma.  Taste leads with chocolate, roasted malts, vanilla.  More chilies than the nose- but no real heat, less coffee.  Just delicious.  Very smooth and creamy, a real tongue coater that lingers.
No closing comment that's different from everyone else.  The clarity and intensity of the flavors is stunning. 620 charactersstortore, Aug 22, 2015

You smell chocolate and nothing else. taste is the chocolate again, Coffee and just a touch of the chili pepper. I was really disappointed in the lack of heat from this brew.  This brew is 14% ABV which honestly you don't get while drinking. The all of a sudden the alcohol hits you like a BOMB!, hence the name.  All in all, enjoyable brew. 427 charactersJamesBondGA, Aug 19, 2015

Nose is chocolate and coffee with hint of vanilla - all there.  Peppers don't come through on the nose for me.
Basically a perfect balance on the flavors here - so damn impressive.  Peppers add a perfect level of heat and compliment what sweet there is so well.  
This is a touch thinner than I'd have expected and I think that's to its benefit.  It's an incredibly drinkable stout with all that's going on - can't believe it's a 13% (compare to a BCBS at 14% that is booze+).  Awesomely delicate - very impressed with this.  Glad I snagged a few to hold on to for the cooler months.
Edit:  I had about 6 of these and noticed that the pepper started to drop off much faster than anticipated.  As that balance was one of my favorite aspects and it dissipated quickly over a matter of weeks I dropped my initial score on both taste and feel 1/4 point from my initial review. 961 charactersoldn00b, Aug 14, 2015

S:  Chocolate, coffee notes, chili peppers, vanilla.
T:  Now I see why they call this a BOMB!  Cacao nibs slide in with coffee and vanilla right behind them.  Light peppering gets your attention but doesn't offend.  Coffee isn't overpowering.  The 14% beings its onslaught quickly. Semi sweet.  Sip slowly and be awed.  So well balanced.  So commanding.
M:  Medium with medium carbonation.  Rich.  Robust.  
O:  At $9.50 for a 12 ounce, this was worth every penny.  Wish I could afford more.  This is a wallop of a beer to share with a good friend or spouse.  Celebrate.  Get BOMB-ed! 730 charactersbrewskifan55, Aug 12, 2015

I get mostly green/red pepper on the nose. Didn't smell bad, but made me anticipate a lot of pepper on the tongue.
The taste really blew me away, and was almost nothing like the nose. The regular decent stout flavor quickly fades into the vanilla. Lots and lots of delicious vanilla. No alcohol on the finish. I also expected some spiciness because of the chiles, but there was none.
Overall, one of the 10 best beers I've ever had. I'll buy more next year. 603 charactersRMelyon, Aug 10, 2015

Such a tasty beer, but I may have to argue that there are too many flavors standing shoulder-to-shoulder; so what you end up with is a cavalcade of tastes elbowing each other out of the way as they cross over your tongue. No, this beer is not bad. It's excellent, but it could be UNBELIEVABLE. Creamy mouthfeel with chili burn on the backend. 636 charactersMakeMineADoubleJack, Aug 05, 2015
4.21/5  rDev -6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4.5Look- Pours like a RIS should. Almost pitch black with a dark khaki head that dissipated within seconds.
Smell- Nothing really jumps out in the nose. Coffee, chocolate, and vanilla that melded together in such a way that none are dominate. Slight chili aroma in the background.
Taste- Much like the aroma. Started with with coffee, chocolate, vanilla, then finished with a slight chili spice. Nicely balanced.
Feel- A little on the thinner side for a 13% impy stout.
Overall- Excellent stout. Worth seeking out and giving it a try. 531 charactersfrothy_80, Aug 05, 2015

4.71/5  rDev +5.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Poured from the bottle into a snifter, Bomb! is a very dark brown/black with a tan head.
The aroma is roasted coffee, vanilla and a touch of dark fruit.
Taste is layered and deep. Coffee, dark chocolate and vanilla in quick waves of flavor, a little heat follows, then a choc latte sweetness and a slight fruity tartness. A finishing warmth seems to come both from the pepper and the booze.
Mouthfeel is medium-thick, creamy and a little viscous.
Seriously excellent beer. 472 charactersSD-Alefan, Jul 27, 2015

What an experience! Black and inky appearance with a beige head. The nose was full of coffee and chili, very subtle on the vanilla and chocolate. Each flavor note  (coffee, cacao nibs, vanilla beans, and ancho chili peppers)  makes an appearance in each sip and blend harmoniously without one overpowering the other.  The lack of alcohol presence was surprising given its ABV. However, the quickly dissipating head indicates the elevated alcohol of the beer. I can see why this beer is held in such high regard. 531 charactersJeffTheJuice, Jul 27, 2015

Aroma – hint of coffee and peppers; picking up neither vanilla nor cocoa. 
Head – none.  A fizzy narrow ring appears as it is poured.  This is gone in less than five seconds.
Lacing - none
Body – dark brown/black, opaque
Flavor – some coffee, some cocoa, lots of chili pepper, no vanilla, no hops, no malt, no alcohol, no diacetyl.  A brief stomach burn follows.
Palate – full, creamy/oily, lively carbonation
Appearance 3, Aroma 3.75, Flavor 4, Palate 4, Overall 3.75   This is an passable imperial stout in which the chilies do not completely overpower the rest of the flavors.  I’m glad I tried it but at $ 10+ for a 12 oz bottle, I won’t be revisiting it. 722 charactersOzzylizard, Jul 26, 2015

A: The beer is a deep dark brown color with a short brown head that fades slowly and leaves a thin lace on the glass.
S: The aroma contains black coffee, roasted malts, chili peppers, chocolate and a faint touch of hops.
T: The taste starts out with a very strong black coffee flavor. Then flavors of chili peppers and chocolate come in along with a very hearty roasted malt character. The chili pepper heat isn’t too strong which I think is a good thing. The hops presence is very mild as you would expect in this type of beer, but there’s enough to bring some balance. There’s no hint of the extremely high ABV. The after-taste is slightly smoky and slightly sweet.
M: A little crisp and a bit chalky, medium-to-heavy body, medium carbonation, finish is very dry and slightly sticky. 
O: Flavorful, goes down dangerously easy, slightly filling, very strong kick, good representation of style, this is a good beer to sip on for a while if you’re in the mood for a coffee-chili stout. 1,111 charactersTheManiacalOne, Jul 24, 2015

The taste really is a flavor "BOMB!" the way they perfectly meld all the flavors together. Coffee and chocolate dominate the pallet with something else pulling up the rear[HEAT]. The chili spice really hit me on the back of the tongue and all the way gown the gullet. Smooth as silk. Very complex and enjoyable.

Roasted malts, tons of cocoa flavor at first. Coffee scent is great, nice sweet aroma as well. Coffee dominates as beer warms up. No notice of vanilla. 
Wow. Tons of cocoa, nice coffee that doesnt overpower. Ancho comes through towards the end, very pleasant counter to the sweet cocoa. Chili comes through at the end of the sip, mostly at the back of the tongue. Didn't notice the vanilla at all. 
Feel is good. For how dark it is, could be a bit thicker, but still fantastic. Smooth, medium to full body. Chili tingled the back of my tongue. 
Delectable brew.  Very well balanced and the notes all hit their spot without disrupting the others. Great as a wake up breakfast beer. 753 charactersfrozyn, Jul 22, 2015

4.38/5  rDev -2.2%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25I got to "tick" this at a bottle share back in 2013. Glad to finally have a chance to sit down and review/enjoy this bottle to myself. Huge thanks to the employee at Grassroots in Jax who saw me browsing the beer isle and offered me one of these as it wasnt even out on the shelf yet.
As stated, this is a freshly released 12oz bottle with no wax or dating to be easily noted. It pours black in color with a rich tan cap a finger strong.
The smell is rich of roast like chocolate and coffee. A slight vanilla sweetness, caramel and mild nod in the direction of earthiness.
The taste is sweet like vanilla/chocolate before getting more bitter and roasty/earthen. Towards the back is a slight coffee character integrated with mild pepper flavor and an accompanying slight warmth of spicy peppers and alcohol.
This is full bodied and moderately carbonated. A very nice execution of all flavors listed on the bottle. The alcohol is masterfully hidden for being in excess of 12%. Id love to have a couple of these to sip on whenever I want but it comes at a hefty price - $10 per 12oz is a stretch over what im comfortable paying but in this case it was well worth it. 1,167 charactersstakem, Jul 21, 2015

A-Dark black body, minimal head
S-Smells up front like chocolate with hints of vanilla and musty green pepper
T-Very smooth chocolate up front, with vanilla and maybe coffee with an after taste of pepper. All you can really taste are the adjuncts but the coffee is pretty tame.
F-Does not feel like 13% (my bottle was 13% not 14%) however it leaves you feeling full. Minimal carbonation.
O-Not worth ten dollars but its alright. I would have enjoyed this more with a bit more spice and less vanilla that tastes like cheap coffee creamer 580 charactersbeerhan, Jul 19, 2015

A:  Very good.  Pours pitch black with a huge head that's slow to dissipate.  On the downside, however, the lacing isn't that great (probably a gravity issue).
S:  Exquisite.  Tons of cacao nibs.  Lots of sweet, rich chocolate as well.  The beer practically smells like heaven.
T:  Follows the smell, which is a GREAT thing.  This beer certainly lives up to the hype.  Lots of milk chocolate and chili peppers.  The cacao is also ever present.  Delicious.
F:  A little underwhelming - somewhat light.  I was expecting a much thicker, richer feel.
O:  A great beer.  Will readily have again. 636 charactersleantom, Jul 18, 2015

While cold the chili peppers are absent, but everybody else showed up. Very thick texture with very little aftertaste on the outset.
Really opening up as it warms. Chocolate & coffee having a friendly debate as to whose on first, vanilla showing usual mild support role with the chili heat bringing up the rear, but are in balance. Very nicely done. Pricey, here in NY, but well worth the experience & given the 14% ABV, that's probably works in my favor. 554 charactersseedyone, Jul 18, 2015

4.32/5  rDev -3.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.2512 oz. bottle poured into a Great Lakes snifter.
Appearance: Pours black with a very thin brown lacing, not much head at all.
Smell: All of the components are there - coffee hits the hardest up front, followed by vanilla, dark chocolate, and a little smokiness from the chiles. A lot of depth in the nose. There is a ton going on and it isn't quite as integrated as it could be, but still excellent.
Taste: A lot more chocolate-forward than the aroma, with quite a bit of vanilla as well and a very subtle chile flavor on the finish. Coffee is there but not nearly as prominent as the aroma. Reminiscent of a Mexican chocolate shake. Not much heat from the chiles up front but it does slowly build as you get through the glass. Vanilla really picks up as well which leads to a pretty sweet finish.
Mouthfeel: Very full-bodied, viscous. Low carbonation. Very smooth - excellent.
Overall: Excellent beer. If the coffee was amped up a bit and they backed off the vanilla it could really be remarkable (although I am hugely fond of coffee, so that may impact my opinion). Not quite as well balanced as the best Mexican-chocolate style stouts out there i.e. Abraxas, but still a great example of the style. 1,206 charactersemyers, Jul 16, 2015

The pepper is extremely balanced, which imparts no pepper spiciness, but leaves some tingling on the tongue and the back of the throat.  The feel is extremely wonderful. Thin to drink but sticks in the mouth.  Sticky finish. Want to keep on drinking. Warms the body. Wish I could buy on the shelf in Michigan. 539 charactershardysf, Jul 08, 2015

Coffee, dark chocolate, hint of smoke, slight sweetness coming through.  The coffee and chocolate come through in the front of the mouth, and a slight heat comes through on the back end.  The mouth feel is a little lighter than I expected, on the lighter side of full.  Overall, one of the best imperial stouts I've had.  So much going on and it's nice to drink a top tier stout that isn't BBA. 514 charactersjoberlander, Jul 05, 2015

4.03/5  rDev -10%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25This pours a dark brown. It has sumptuous brown hues. Thick and pours out slow like oil. A creamy head of chocolate colored foam reminds me of a milkshake. This beer will show you lace and legs. Nose is sweet chocolate caramel and cream. Earthy coffee and the bright presence of the pepper. No vanilla. The pepper seemed to fade into the beer as the malts took over. Caramel a bit nutty and a light airy chocolate. The taste is silken and long. That caramel is luscious alright and lasts on the palate. There's barley and a grainy roast that does not touch burnt so it's creamy. There is a cocoa powder so light so provocative that it actually feels like a dusting of cocoa powder on the back of the throat. it is delicate and that is a pleasant paradox. The pepper is earthy and shows you everything gently but no real heat. There is a touch of cream to this flavor that lets you see the depth of that roast but only askance as it finishes full, slightly chewy . The pepper finally flares up just a little in the aftertaste and the beer ends smooth, dry and beyond chocolatey.
As far as my taste score goes , the pepper was a brief moment on the nose and hard to find in the beer. That made it a pleasant stout for sure. The abv was impressive the mouthfeel exquisite.    The  flavor of the pepper was absent on the palate as well as heat from pepper was absent in the finish.  No vanilla at all. 1,398 charactersutopiajane, Jul 05, 2015

Color is black with a thin tan head.  The aroma is coffee, roasted malt and chocolate.  Really nice.

4.41/5  rDev -1.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.75A: The beer is jet black in color. It poured with a quarter finger high dark tan head that died down, but never completely faded away, leaving a large thick web of bubbles on the surface, a collar around the edge, and some lacing down the sides of the glass. 
S: Moderate strong aromas of coffee beans are present in the nose along with notes of the chili peppers and hints of cocoa nibs. Faint amounts of vanilla beans also become noticeable as the beer warms up. 
T: Similar to the smell, the taste starts off with strong flavors of coffee beans but as it warms up the ancho chilies begin to creep in and provide a spicy balance to the underlying cocoa nibs. 
M: It feels a bit more than medium-bodied on the palate and has a moderate amount of carbonation. 
O: This beer might be a bomb with the mélange of ingredients, but it tastes nothing like something that is 14% abv because it hides its alcohol exceptionally well. If you let it warm up, there becomes a good balance between all of the flavors.

4.93/5  rDev +10%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This made a cross country trip with me from San Diego (Bottlecraft) to Western PA. Poured into the snifter. Absolutely pitch and devoid of light, with the thinnest ring of khaki head. Definite alcohol legs on this baby. Aromas of chocolate (and such deep, rich, REAL chocolate), very subtle vanilla, some alcohol sweetness that reminds me of Kahlua,  dark roast coffee all at a very cold 40 degrees from the fridge. More vanilla working around as the glass warms. The flavors on this were immense. TONS of chocolate and coffee crashing like waves over my palate. Again subtle vanilla, and after a few sips I began to notice a slight warmth from the chiles. Vanilla and chiles (which can be overpowering flavors) were used with a very restrained hand. Big coating mouthfeel. One sip remained on my palate for what seemed like an eternity. Warmed up my chest after a few sips. This beer is an absolute monster, and the best stout that I have tried... possibly the best beer/beer experience I have tried. This bomb blew the hype out of the water, and stood tall. If you can find it, try it. 1,087 charactersMikus, Jul 01, 2015

Taste: Perfect balance of sweet/crispy, and dry. Chocolate with cinnamon and vanilla.  A touch of coffee acidity in the middle which opens to some very faint hotness.  Some hot spiced rum comes in from the middle and stays until the end.
Notes:  Had this at the Shakespeare festival with Nina as a birthday present in Orinda.  We are tasting it now in our chicken coop in Arcata.  Probably on the top 3 list of best beers I've ever had. 587 characterstravolta, Jun 30, 2015

Pours black with a small brown head. Pretty still. Smell is rich chocolate and coffee, something sweet and syrupy, more coffee, and maybe molasses.

on tap at The Distillery, Savannah, GA on 21 December 2014
12 oz. for $9
Listed at 11.5% abv, this Imperial stout is aged on cocoa nibs, ancho chili, vanilla beans, and coffee. The chili is clearly present in the nose, but not so much in the flavor, and the other ingredients are fairly mild, but surprisingly they all make an appearance at one point or another. The only drawback to this beer is that it doesn't quite live up to the rich maltiness that you might expect of an Imperial stout, although if it had I doubt the 'spicing' would have worked as well. Impressive, and certainly worth seeking out! 635 charactersNeroFiddled, Jun 28, 2015

4.17/5  rDev -6.9%look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Look and lacing is just as I like it for an imperial stout--blackness in most of middle, and a solid light brown head circling. Aroma presents vanilla immediately. Chili is perfect. I actually don't like the habaneroed beers (Cake, Sculpin), so I was concerned about how prominent the bite might be. Turned out to be just right. As with most imperial stouts, this really enhanced itself with warming. My only drawback was that the body was not as robust as I expected for a 13%er. But it's unquestionably a stand-out. For non-BA imperial stouts, I'd still take an Expedition over this, but this was very good. 609 charactersBuccoFan, Jun 28, 2015

Beer pours very dark and no light passes through it when held up to same.  Virtually no head, just a minuscule little dark tan crown around the edges of the glass.
Aroma is bold and simple: cocoa, coffee, vanilla  and chile.
Flavor is the same as the smell: coffee, mild chile, some vanilla and bitterness.  Just not very tasty to this palate; the peppers ruin it.
Mouthfeel is thick and smooth but slightly coating and lacking in carbonation.  Some alcohol heat.
Overall, I fail to see what all the excitement is about.  Will not be drinking this one again. 647 characterscharlzm, Jun 20, 2015

5/5  rDev +11.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Beautiful thick, black pour.  All black, light stands no chance against this, even around the edges.  The head slowly forms from the bottom up.  Maybe a finger thick and light brown in color.  Retains fairly well given the ABV, resulting in a thin, spotty lace.
Nothing but dark roasty things went into this beer.  Roasted grains, coffee and chocolate all fill the nose.  You have to dig to get to the peppers, but you'll notice them.  
The taste kills.  It's flawless.  Coffee with hints of chocolate.  The rest of the stuff is totally superfluous as these two ingredients are all that's needed.  Bittersweet chocolate in the finish and barely a note of the alcohol.
Again, this is flawless.  It's ultra creamy and smooth from the get go.  Slightly sweet up front, with evolving bitterness and warmth in the finish.  Full bodied and borderline dry finish.  
This is an exceptional beer.  For 13% ABV, it's a bit too easy to drink.  You don't have to sip it, but you should.  Basically impossible to improve upon. 1,018 charactersRickS95, Jun 19, 2015

4.59/5  rDev +2.5%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pour into a small tulip glass. Almost no head whatsoever. Intricate lacing. Color resembles that of black coffee.
Has a strong smell of coffee, some toffee, cacao, slight smell of pepper, and rich vanilla.
Full bodied. Creamy feel in the mouth - almost like a latte. Little carbonation. Smooth and not biting in the slightest.
My tastebuds are first greeted by black coffee, which fades to vanilla, then to chocolate, and then to a spiciness of peppers and other hot spices. Has a dry finish, urging another sip. Bitter coffee aftertaste. No flavor is overpowering here - perfectly balanced. Long finish.
Really surprising that this beer is 13% ABV. Very rich and while it is quite drinkable, would be hard to drink more than two - almost a dessert or an after dinner coffee. While this didn’t quite live up to the hype, I believe it may have to grow on me. Also possible that this wasn’t the best batch, as I noticed that there was some rust on the lip of the glass, which may explain the lack of carbonation. Overall, quite enjoyable and one of the darker stouts I’ve had. Will try again after drinking more imperials. 1,130 charactersMaxGreen, Jun 17, 2015

4.57/5  rDev +2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5The pour looks good, a viscous jet black with a moderate, very dark brown head. 
The first whiff steps it up a notch. Coffee and vanilla are the dominant  aromas, but there is chocolate, a hint of cinnamon, and a peppery spiciness too.  
Next comes this whole drinking part. Wow! Wow!! Did I mention wow? Lots of vanilla up front, followed by chocolate, smooth roasted coffee, and cinnamon with very subtle, tamed heat from peppers. Aftertaste is extremely smooth. Not much bitterness, with a lingering hazelnut/ vanilla latte taste with a touch of cinnamon. No alcohol in this one despite the 13% bill. 
Body is better than medium for sure. Silky, somewhat creamy with an average amount of carbonation. 
This is the only beer that I have had that I would even compare to Hunahpu. I think it sits somewhere in between that and Xocaveza. Just a touch too much vanilla I think (from a vanilla junkie for what it's worth). Would like to see a hair more coffee presence. However, I would say this is probably one of the top one of the top 10-20 stouts I have had. Fantastic. 1,074 charactersWesMantooth, Jun 14, 2015

A: Pours a pitch black color, almost no head with a vigorous pour. Has a medium body in the glass, very calm.
S: Chocolate, coffee, cinnamon, hazelnut, cocoa. Very nice balance of all these aromas, not one overpowering. 
T: Lots of spice, chocolate and vanilla up front. Finishes with lots of cinnamon, vanilla, cocoa, coffee, espresso, and even more spice. 
M: Medium mouthfeel, decent carbonation. 13% is hidden extremely well, as there's no boozyness to this at all. Spice level is mild-to-moderate. There's just enough to notice it and warm the beer up a bit. 
O: After hunting this beer for quite some time now, it's finally nice to get a hold of a bottle. I've had Christmas Bomb! before this one, so I had some idea of what to expect. This one is really good, but I somewhat prefer the extra spice and flavor of Christmas Bomb! to this one. There's a lot going on here and there's a lot of depth, but it just feels like one or two things are missing. Maybe barrel-aging or a bit of a stronger presence from the coffee. Not sure. As far as the style, it's certainly up there for me, maybe #1 thus far, but I've yet to try Abraxas or Hunahpu. 
Recommendation: Definitely worth seeking out or trading for. I just wouldn't give up an arm or a leg for it. 1,372 charactersSparty1224, Jun 08, 2015

Finally I have acquired a bottle of Prairie Bomb!, 'Imperial stout aged on coffee, cacao nibs, vanilla beans, and chili peppers'. per the label.
Poured into a clear balloon snifter.
A - it pours a dark inky black with hardly any conjuration of head at all.  Some dark mocha skims the glass and leaves lots of good sticky lacing when given a nice swirl.
S - A luscious aroma greets the senses.  This thing is literally bursting with gooey chocolatey goodness and authentic freshly grinded coffee beans. Smells sticky, gooey, & creamy. Smells absolutely delicious.
T - Taste follows the nose: very smooth & creamy. Lots of gooey chocolate / cacao nib goodness steals the show for me. Very authentic freshly brewed coffee flavor. The vanilla beans are present, but are mostly lost to the other flavors.  The chili peppers lend only a very subtle heat on the finish. Roasty, with mild notes of char, and a mild metallic note that is just a bit off-putting for me. Very complex stuff.
M - The mouthfeel is extremely smooth & creamy, especially at 13.00% abv.  Medium-full bodied with low lying carb. Still, very easy-drinking stuff considering the high abv.
Overall, an excellent stout from Prairie Artisan Ales, it's no wonder this beer is so highly acclaimed.  Would definitely be interested in seeing how other variants of this one fare.

Taste chocolate roasted chile vanilla 
Overall:  I've done a lot of traveling lately this is one of the most unique flavor profiles I have come across.  It goes down so easy despite the high abv.  It is the type of beer you crave to drink when you haven't had it in a while and can still remember exactly how it tastes. 443 charactersEEscobar, May 31, 2015

4.31/5  rDev -3.8%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Prairie Artisan Ale's Bomb!, imperial stout aged on coffee, cacao nibs, vanilla beans, and chili peppers. 13% ABV.
A: Less than half a finger of slightly lopsided, brown head. Decent lacing and sheeting; both hold quite well. Black in the glass; very dark brown in the dimple. Very slight inkiness.
S: Up front, smells like a soft, yet very deep, coffee. Very fresh beans. Some definite dry cocoa nibs. Subtle vanilla. Slight chili pepper edge. Very faint char note. The scents are well controlled, so you have to really look for things other than what's actually added. I think of this as a plus, but others might disagree.
T/MF: Really smooth on the palate. Definite waxy sweetness from the peppers. Bittersweet chocolate and sweet coffee. Not overpoweringly sweet, but the flavors are all of a sweet leaning. Subtle piquancy around the edges. Actually, quite a bit like drinking a less sweet Mexican/Mayan/Aztec hot chocolate. Bitter notes of the chocolate and coffee "bloom" as you swallow. Fairly long finish. Very nice! 1,028 charactersTruePerception, May 29, 2015

**Second chance from 12oz bottle poured into snifter. 
This really is phenomenal. Had this as my first beer of the evening with nothing else to change my palate. Lots of chocolate, dark chocolate, tastes. I understand the 100/100 rating now. 483 charactersSMH_NWI, May 29, 2015

Very boozy at the end with the licorice.  Somewhat of a chili aftertaste.  Full bodied.  Low carbonation.

L:  black, almost no head, just a thin skin of tan foam, no lacing or sticking; keeping a decent collar
S:  chocolate, chocolate milk shake ... mocha java shake/frappachino (chocolate espresso) ... very sweet with lots of vanilla, too ... hints of alcohol (rum, wine, vodka)
T:  chocolate bomb ... loads of sweet chocolate, vanilla ... mocha java shake/frappachino again ... following the nose almost 1-to-1 with just a hint of chili heat on the lips (no chili in the taste); alcohol might be showing up in the flavor, but only slightly
F:  fantastic ... midweight with plenty of carbonation, not overly thick or slick
O:  awesome stout for the chocolate lover ... it doesn't have raw coffee/espresso flavor, but it *does* taste a lot like a sweet frozen espresso drink with lots of chocolate and/or vanilla in it.  the alcohol does show up in the nose and flavor, but it's relatively tame.  this bottle is probably aged 3-4 months, perhaps as much as 6 months (born-on date is rubbed off), and it drinks very nicely. 1,062 charactersPremo88, May 25, 2015

This is fantastic!
A deep, deep brown almoust black beer with a three finger high, beigebrown head that dissapears fast and leaves no lacing on the glass.
Nose: Wow! This IS a bomb... Coffee, dark chocolate, vanilla, anchor chili,  brown sugar, molasses and Turkish Pepper. 
Taste: Sweet roasted malt, espresso, brown sugar, vanilla bean, chili,  cocoa, dark fruit, oak, licorice... this is a complex taste! 
Body: Full body with a complex texture. Light carbonation. A nice "sting" from the chili (but not too much - As we say in Sweden: "Lagom") - This is a beatiful, complex, tasty, big beer and still easy drinkable! 628 characterscraftbeersweden, May 22, 2015

Smell dominated by cocoa and dark chocolate, with some coffee excellently integrated into the mix. The taste is also very cocoa-heavy, with vanilla and coffee, caramel and a bit of alcohol warmth (or is it the chilies?). Excellent beer. 305 charactersMarius, May 17, 2015

4.27/5  rDev -4.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25While I generally prefer my beers without chile in them, this is a really well integrated example of a chile beer. Coffee, cacao, vanilla bean and ancho chili all come through very well, but none overpowers the others. 
I'd recommend this highly to anyone that enjoys chile beers, especially if you also like vanilla. A lot of beers with vanilla bean in them don't let the vanilla shine through, but this one nails it.
A little steep at $10 or 12 for a 12 oz. bottle, but a very good beer, and one I'm glad I finally got to try. As with other chile beers, I'd imagine a barrel-aged version would be phenomenal, as it would mellow out the chile and coffee (which aren't my two favorite flavors). 696 charactersSeanBond, May 13, 2015

Notes from 01/01/2015 – Happy New Year kids
Finally was able to scoop one of these up in SoCal!
A:  Dark obsidian body, right down to the glossy appearance.  Perhaps some darkened brown hues to it.  Slightly viscous looking.  A shortened layer of mocha tan head fastens to the top of the glass.  Holds over nice and true with a real creamy looking consistency.  Very little sudsy remains noted.
S:  Smells like a true Mexican Mole dish would.  I get raisin with dark chocolate, coffee cake, and molasses.  Then cinnamon stick added with some toasted grains and other earthy spices.  Trails into a faint hint of those smoky ancho  peppers.  Lightly stinging while enticingly sweet.  
T:  Huge melted chocolate flavor with dark fruits, cinnamon spice, and vanilla accents.  Tastes like a mixture of bitter dark and sweetened cocoa.  Then comes a wonderfully creeping chili heat that builds towards the finish.  Stays mild and never becomes unbearably so.  Coffee is a bit more subtle here but of the darkest rich espresso roast.  Seems to accent everything with a mild smokiness that interplays with the chilies and dark roasted malts.  
M:  Plays between a frothy texture and slightly chewy with a sleek stickiness on the palate.  Really is quite a full bodied brew while not seemingly so.  Dash of that dry peppery heat on the finish.
D:  Bomb goes BOOM!  A little late to the wagon but yeah I am a big fan.  I think here it is all about the better balance to all the flavors.  The vanilla just seems to accentuate those central notes of chocolate, spice, and dark fruit to another level.  Very good.  Wish I could get this on the regular. 1,710 charactersNugganooch, May 13, 2015

4.96/5  rDev +10.7%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5This is one of those "holy shit" beers.
Pours an extremely dark brown, although not pitch black.  Holding it up to the light, a slight red hue shines through on the very bottom.  
Smells of sweet chocolate, vanilla, with the chilis barely making an appearance.
Tastes decadent up front with strong chocolate and vanilla notes.  The chilis come in on the finish and just balance everything out extremely well.
Can hardly tell this is a 13% beer as it is not extremely thick on the mouth feel, and there is no alcohol burn whatsoever.
Bottom Line...this is one of the best beers i've ever had.  If you see it, pick it up.  You won't be disappointed. 648 charactersSLewis, May 11, 2015

It's beautiful, and takes all its effort to form just a sheen of red oak head.  The nose is exceptional, as thick as the pour - sweet and chocolatey, with some spice.  Before you ever sip you know this beer is world class.  The taste and mouthfeel follow suit brilliantly, with the chili adding a perfect counterpoint to the cocoa, vanilla, and coffee.  On par with Bourbon County for me.  The only other beer I've found with such a presence. 528 charactersFoxybrau, May 09, 2015

Pours out black as expected. Had a good finger of dark tan head with nice retention, especially taking into account the 13% ABV. The nose is all about the coffee. Loved the aroma... The flavor is coffee forward, with vanilla and a little chocolate. The chili peppers are incorporated perfectly for both my taste and palate. Not sure if the that little tingle on the finish is the pepper or the alcohol. Probably a combo. This has a nice smooth body, and is a perfect slow drinker to unwind. Glad to recommend this brew.

A: Pours a deep motor oil black with a couple finger of dense, thick, dark brown head. Head took a few moments to slowly fade into a bubbly collar and wispy film. Spotty lace was left down the glass. 
S: Notes of rich dark chocolate, chocolate syrup, and chocolate fudge, and sweet vanilla combine with spicy chipotle pepper and capsaicin notes and a touch of roast/toast. Smells very strong, rich, and potent. 
T: Extremely rich and strong flavors of dark chocolate, chocolate fudge, caramel, brown sugar, chipotle pepper, vanilla, roast, leather, and slight toasted marshmallow.  Booze is hidden well as far as heat, but this beer is so thick and heavy that you can tell it packs a punch. The finish is full of sweet and rich chocolate brownie, and the aftertaste is slightly boozy with some lingering vanilla, coffee, and lingering pepper heat. 
M: Thick body, one of the thickest I’ve had in a long time, with a heavy, chew, and thick mouthfeel, with smooth and soft carbonation. The alcohol is mildly warming but never hot or especially boozy. 
O: What a potent beer. This is an excellent sipper and all the ingredients work together masterfully. The pepper lends more flavor than it does heat, and overall there is a nice level of sweetness from the vanilla and cocoa that balancing the heat without being cloying. Coffee is noticeable, although I’d say it isn’t as prominent as the other ingredients. Overall a very well executed beer. 1,476 charactersscottfrie, May 02, 2015

This thing is a vanilla bomb, to the point where it takes over everything else, especially considering I was looking forward to some chile spice. Plenty of chocolate too, it's like Southern Tier's Mokah on steroids. Still quite tasty, but would be more successful if it was billed as a milkshake/desert beer, rather than a spiced stout. 555 charactersMongrel, May 02, 2015

Righteous aroma of coffee with beautifully subtle cocoa and vanilla undertones.  Taste is spot on hitting the cocoa and vanilla upfront before the middle body of coffee and roasted malts and a finish of the chili and spicy hops.  Perfect mouth feel. Full body with medium carbonation that is perfectly creamy and smooth through out. No aftertastes, bitterness, or hints of booze.
Amazing beer. It's better than the hype it has, which is saying something. Easily worth the $5.99 a bottle. Bravo Prairie, Bravo. 618 charactersOKbrew89, Apr 28, 2015

Smell is coffee, dark chocolate (bitter), vanilla, and chili underlining everything. Taste is a lot of dark chocolate, vanilla, a touch of caramel sweetness, coffee. The chili is slight, certainly less than I anticipated. The feel is superb-creamy and smooth. 
Been wanting to try this for a while and it's lived up to the hype for me. For a 13% abv, this is really drinkable and delicious. Will seek out more of this for sure! 512 charactersAppaZappa, Apr 25, 2015

Appearance - pitch black in the glass with a thin, tan head that recedes quickly. Lacing is nonexistant.
Smell - the description on the bottle is what you pick up in the nose; beginning with the roasted pepper, followed by the coffee, chocolate and vanilla...very nice!
Taste - this is silky smooth; more vanilla and cocoa with a hint of coffee and pepper...superb flavor!
Feel - smooth, flavorful and complex; probably the easiest drinking 13% beer around!
Overall - excellent as advertised; cellaring another bottle and will likely pick up another soon if I can! 644 charactersDenverHopHead, Apr 23, 2015

Pours dark with a tan head, 
Smell immediately reminded me of a damp earthy smell, like edge of a damp wooded area, some one else compared it to a wet grain like smell. 
Taste is so loud, all the coffee and cocao nibs explode right to the forefront the vanilla comes creeping in on the tail. Thick and delicious 344 charactersBelgeko, Apr 20, 2015

A - 5 - Pours a jet black color, forms up a half finger of extremely dark tan to light brown colored head. Low head potential, medium head retention, spotty lacing.
S - 4.25 - Bittersweet baker's chocolate, roasty coffee, lots of malt, a little pepper spice and strangely enough I was getting a kind of olive juice thing going on.
T - 4.75 - Damned good, plenty of medium bittersweet chocolate, coffee, vanilla, and a DECENT amount of pepper and spice. Could DEFINITELY have had more and would have pushed this to a perfect 5 score.
F - 5 - Nice thick and creamy mouthfeel.
O - 4.75 - This is definitely a tasty imperial stout, but the pepper was almost a tease to me, I wanted just a little bit more. I think Stone's Xocoveza is still my superior peppered stout/porter, but this is super tasty nontheless! 841 charactersBeer-Revelry, Apr 18, 2015

Smell is of dark chocolate, roasted coffee, a little vanilla, and some dark fruits. Taste follows the nose for the most part. More coffee in there though. Vanilla is faint and some sweetness on the back end. I kinda wish the chili peppers were more pronounced. They're really subtle. Mouthfeel is ridiculously good. No alcohol in there, really smooth and just the right amount of carbonation. As this beer warms the alcohol is a bit more noticeable though. Overall, awesome awesome stuff. Forget about barrel aged stouts, this is what I like. 629 charactersMisSigsFan, Apr 18, 2015

Although it is impressive that every flavor and ingredient that is described comes through nicely in all it's balance, it's the way the peppers show through that sets this apart in my eyes. To me it drinks like a lot of other very well done imperial stouts. Bomb is a fantastic beer . . . But probably no better than any other more readily available spiced stout in your area. 428 charactersGOBLIN, Apr 03, 2015

12 oz. bottle, snifter
2014 vintage, aged one year
A – Black, opaque, fairly thick on the pour, oily.  A half-inch of deep brown foam, the bubbles rising and popping on the surface.
S – Very rich dark chocolate, bittersweet baking chocolate, light vanilla, some organic/vegetal spice.  Strong coffee bean aroma, maybe like cold-pressed.  Seems like some bitter hop aroma, and a light touch of fruitiness, perhaps alcohol/esters.
T – Vanilla is very prominent, along with dark chocolate and chocolate malt.  Coffee is lower than in the aroma, providing some roasted malt-like flavor.  Chili peppers mostly on the finish, providing just a touch of heat, though it strengthens as the beer warms.  Bitter hops provide some herbal notes as well. 
M – Very full-bodied and actually very well-carbonated, at a moderate level, for the style.  Bitterness from malt, coffee, hops are all moderate in intensity, and only low residual sweetness present.  Mild alcohol heat combines with the low chili pepper heat.
O – For everything going on in this beer, it is incredibly balanced and really allows each component to not only be discernible but to shine.  Aging has mellowed some of the bitterness and alcohol harshness, and has subdued some of the chili spice. Excellent. 1,293 charactersinfinitebruner, Apr 01, 2015

A.   Pours black with a 2 finger khaki head with some pretty good retention.   Spotty lacing around glass. 
S.   Roasted malts,  milk chocolate, vanilla, and definite chili peppers are filling the nose.   Sneaks very nice.   Sweet with some spice. 
T.   Yum.  This is very nice.   All the notes from the nose.   The chocolate is rich and the pepper is there just for enough spice.  Some vanilla and coffee.  Chewy.    Very good! 
M.   Velvety. Slight carbonation which I like in a stout.   Plays well with the chili.  Clean finish.    Really nice. 
O.   An awesome beer.  Very nice flavors that balance well.   I'm really happy with this beer and will be looking for more. 713 charactersIPAGeorge, Mar 29, 2015

The smell is an intoxicating mix of coffee and dark chocolate that hints at the beer's heavy alcohol content. The taste of the coffee is awesome. I can see why the brewer featured the coffee brand on its label. The rich flavors of the beer hide the alcohol taste dangerously well. While it is a gorgeous rich dark espresso color, there was not much of a head on it. 399 charactersBeeroness, Mar 25, 2015

4.29/5  rDev -4.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25Pours a black body with mahogany highlights. Head is tan and 1/4 inch. Lacing and head retention are good.
Smell is of fresh brewed coffee, slightly acidic. Smoked malt and oak are also present, almost like burning wood. As beer warms the chili pepper starts coming through, though I don't get much cacao or vanilla beans. Hops aren't present but at 13% abv, alcohol is definitely there.
First tastes are of smoked malt, chocolate, and chili pepper. Heat from ancho and heat from alcohol complement each other nicely. Not getting much vanilla or hops but flavor of acidic coffee makes up for it. 
Mouthfeel is medium heavy, nicely coats the tongue. Carbonation is high for such a high alcohol stout. Head stayed around in some form adding a nice frothy texture. 
Overall great beer. Interesting combo with the espresso, pepper, and chocolate executed well. Flavors are bold without being overwhelming and alcohol is well hidden for such a high abv. The coffee and peppers really hit my sweet spot, looking forward to having more of this soon. 1,046 charactersangelmonster, Mar 25, 2015

Chili peppers right out of the gate! Followed by the cocoa, dark chocolate and coffee in the nose. Super dark brown color with ruby reddish hues when held to the light. Liquid oily thick viscosity yields a frothy top layer of micro bubbles and spotty patches of lacing along the glass edges. Bold and complex flavor profile is surprisingly simple. Tastes like chilies, then evolving into the sweet chocolate and finishing with the bitter dark roasted coffee. Soft and gentle carbonation allows for each sip to be enjoyed on the palate and finishes extremely well with very little heat from the chilies or alcohol. So easy to drink and no way to tell it clocks in at 13%. To summarize; Bomb! will go down as one of the more amazing Imperial Stouts I have had the privilege to indulge! 815 charactersdpgoblejr, Mar 23, 2015

Look: very very dark with a small head that dissipates very quickly leaving no signs of lacing. 
Smell: I'm getting a lot of chiles and chocolate on the nose with a bit of vanilla and a bit of alcohol as well. 
Taste. Holy crap! Lots and lots of chocolate with vanilla upfront fading to chiles towards the end. Pretty sweet on the chocolate and vanilla. Not really any heat from the chiles, just taste. 
Mouthfeel: Very smooth, surprisingly smooth actually. Very little carbonation. Not hot what so ever for being 13%. 
Overall: This is now one of my favorite stouts. My only complaint is that it is a bit sweet. Other than that it is damn near perfect. I need to get my hands on more of this. 718 charactersTylertut, Mar 19, 2015

Extremely well balanced for such a high ABV and I got little to no alcohol off it. 
Expertly brewed and worth the hype. Glad I got to try it. Pricey at $10 for 12oz., but definitely worth grabbing a few and stashing them away for a special day/night. 428 charactersTheHopBrewKid, Mar 15, 2015
3.76/5  rDev -16.1%look: 3.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.75Barely any head on it. Smells kind of like a earthy garden. I do smell some chili. Initial taste is cacao and a hint of chili up front, then comes some alcohol taste. The finish is tart but yet mostly of coffee. Overall is it worth the $10 for the 12oz? Probably not. Serpent stout is still better in my opinion, but I at least tried it, right? 344 charactersjooler, Mar 15, 2015

Initial taste is of chili peppers, coffee, and roasted malts. The presence of chili peppers almost over powers the coffee and and roasted malt flavors. All flavors persist through final taste with the taste of alcohol entering to finish off the symphony of flavors. If alcohol content was decreased along with a reduction of chili peppers used, the beer would go from amazing to phenomenal. 508 charactersMyotus, Mar 14, 2015

Look: Midnight black with a creamy mocha colored head that resides to a thick film. Nice lacing initially.
Aroma: Dark roasted malts, rich cocoa, and ancho chili peppers bring some nasal-clearing heat. Very subtle vanilla sweetness in the middle.
Taste: First of all, the peppery heat from the ancho chills is absolutely perfect -- not too hot, but enough to sense it. A very dark chocolatey beginning with a lot of roasted malts. A sweeter vanilla middle gives way to the heat of ancho chilis. The finish is a bit chalky with a cocoa aftertaste.
Mouthfeel: Smooth, creamy.
Overall: A perfect blend of ingredients with a perfect amount of heat. Alcohol is almost undetectable. Delicious sipper. 728 charactersJuicesFlowing, Mar 08, 2015

3.92/5  rDev -12.5%look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4On draft at the Hourglass Brewery. Pitch black body with hardly any head. I can pick out the chilies in the aroma along with a lot more coffee than expected. Chocolate is also present. The taste is coffee forward along with a complex blend of sweet milk chocolate, dark chocolate, and vanilla. There is a vegetable taste from the peppers that I do not care for. I get medium heat from the chilies and very minimal alcohol presence for the ABV. The mouth feel is very smooth, but I would prefer a little more body. This is a very well crafted beer and I would like to have it again; but I don't care for the vegetable taste. 623 charactersdanh53, Mar 02, 2015

Aromas of wonderful Mexican chocolate, with the cacao up front backed by an appropriately soft but noticeable amount of vanilla and the faintest hint of chili.
Body is thinner than expected -- more along porter lines -- but is robust and extremely complex in flavour and balance. Rolling waves of cacao, vanilla, and chile fight for dominance around the palate, with just the right amount of coffee so that it adds rather than detracts from the complex chocolate characters.
Chocolate and vanilla up front and throughout, with just enough chile and coffee on the finish to add a ton of complexity. Easily one of the best stouts I've had the pleasure of tasting. Thank you, Craig! 779 charactersIan_B, Feb 28, 2015

12 oz bottle poured into 10 oz snifter.
Dark black. Tan head that fades fast to to a thin lace around glass.
Smells of chocolate and cinnamon with a little alcohol.
Tastes great. Very smooth. I get the cinnamon first, chocolate second with a hot finish.
Great beer. 287 charactersRayReed522, Feb 22, 2015

4.91/5  rDev +9.6%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75I enjoyed this beer on draught at the Beer Trappe in Lexington, KY. It pours opaque black into a snifter. The head is a mocha brown that dissipates quickly. The nose is predominantly roasted coffee followed by rich spicy Mexican chocolate. That's exactly how it tastes, also. Peppery dark bittersweet chocolate predominates over the roasted coffee and grilled breadfruit.  There is very little gas in the mouthfeel which is just right, not too thin or too thick.  Overall close to perfect. I hope to try a bourbon barrel aged version in the future. 548 characterstomfneph, Feb 21, 2015

It's a burn, not from alcohol but the actual chili peppers.  The longer it sits the more flavors you smell. This is one of the best beers I've had. I would definitely buy it again. I recommend anyone to try it if they haven't already. 340 charactersMatt1978, Feb 20, 2015

4.5/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Got this on a trade and it seemed very interesting.
A - Pours a dark brown and settles into a deep black with a small brown colored head with moderate lacing.
S - Rich aroma with roast, chocolate and coffee. Some sweet malt, vanilla, and alcohol is also present. 
T - The roastiness from the smell is first but closely accompanied by the rich cocoa, malt, and coffee tones. Again the traditional stout flavors are then changed in the middle by the unique ingredients of the chilies and the vanilla. There is just so much going on in this beer it is difficult to pick out all that is going on in one sip. The finish has some alcohol and a bitter finish. I didn't pick up any spice from the chili.
M - Big mouth-feel. low carbonation. Overall balanced but slightly cloying and the flavors just stick to the palate.
Overall, this is a very good imperial stout. This beer has a ton of novel flavors including the chilies and the vanilla but overall it almost makes it muddled for my palate trying to pick out the flavors that are trying to come together. I did very much enjoy this beer but I feel that there are better tasting stouts out there.

Normally, I won't taste all aspects of a beer as described on a label. This one was perfect. Pay the money for a bottle.
Look: Black in color and poured with very little head. NIce lacing on the glass as a slowly savored the beer.
Smell: Definitely smell the coffee and chocolate with a faint hint of the peppers.
Taste: Oh boy. Love when a beer matches the hype. Layers of taste. Initial taste of coffee, chocolate, and ending with the peppers. Perfect balance of flavors.
Feel: Not too thin, not too thick.
Overall: Layers. Balance. Incredible. I'm not afraid to say that I love this beer. 703 charactersQuakeAttack, Feb 12, 2015

Smell - Delicious rich coffee aroma.  A nice subtle chili spice is present as well.  Dark chocolate reveals itself the more I smell.  Very inviting.  4.5 paws.
Taste - Intense coffee and subtle chili flavor up front with velvety chocolate coming through on the finish.  The vanilla gets lots amidst all the robust flavors, but does provide a smoothing balance.  There is a bit of a woody character present as well.  Bitter finish, not sure if it is provided by the hops or coffee/cocoa nibs.  Quite delicious.  4.75 paws.
Feel - Smooth and creamy, mild tingle on the tip and sides of tongue.  The chili spice is very noticeable on the lips.  4.75 paws.
Overall - I've been wanting to try this one for a long time, and it did not disappoint.   I love stouts with chocolate and chilies and this is one of the best.  Always nice to have a beer that lives up to the hype.  4.75 paws. 1,071 charactersBowWowWowYippyYoIPA, Feb 07, 2015

4.93/5  rDev +10%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Fellow Craft Brew Review author Nicholas Publicover recommended that I sample this beer since late August, and I’m happy to report finally managed to get my hands on one! Ordinarily I’d shy away from beers that are infused with chili peppers since I had a really bad batch of Terrapin Brewery’s “Guano Loco” not too long ago, and this is definitely a beer that I’d suggest sampling first if possible due to its extremely high price tag (bottles run between $8-10, and the cheapest that I’ve seen a four pack of is $25). So was it worth splurging on? Did it live up to the hype? Let’s see.
Appearance – 95: Bomb! had all of the characteristics that I look for when reviewing an imperial stout:  Black in color which remained true when led up against the light, and little to no head when poured (perhaps a tenth of an inch, which almost immediately dissapated).
Aroma – 97: Each time that I took a whiff I detected other notes in the beer, which was unexpected given the chili pepper infusion. True to the description, a rich roasted coffee aroma exists with a definite chocolate overtone. The pepper was noticeable, but unlike the beer’s namesake, I didn’t want to blow off my nose after the first sniff (thankfully). I could also detect the strong ABV right from the get-go.
Body and Texture- 98: I was incredibly impressed with the layering-effect of flavor that took place in my mouth. The body of the beer is medium-heavy, which is about what to expect for an imperial stout. I was worried that the chili peppers would dominate my taste buds from the start and drown out any remaining flavors, but surprisingly that wasn’t the case.
Taste – 99: The first flavor that I detected was smooth vanilla, followed by a coffee/ chocolate mixture and then finally the chili peppers. In every sense of the word, these flavors work to compliment one another and are very well structured. The vanilla bean beginning is just enough to wash away any lingering pepper aftertaste from a prior sip, the coffee/chocolate notes were prevalent and delicious.. and then perhaps my favorite part of the beer (which I never expected to say) was the chili peppers! Unlike “Guano Loco” which had a horrible aftertaste that made my mouth feel like it was on fire, there was just enough pepper in the beer to make it noticeable without being unpleasant or dominating. The roasted coffee and spiciness play well off of one another and mask the massive 13% ABV.
Overall – 98.1 (World-class): I don’t want to say that I went in with low expectations of the beer given my prior chili pepper disappointments.. rather the reviews that I read were so full of praise that I was skeptical that it would live up to the hype. This is my official “I’m eating crow” paragraph. Well done, Prairie Artisan Ales. The smell, look and flavor of this amazing beer is all world-class, and for anyone who enjoys imperial stouts, I can’t recommend grabbing and trying one of these enough. The price point is rather high, but well deserved considering the quality of the beer. I’m not afraid to say that this is the best imperial stout I’ve ever tasted, bar none.
Purchase Value – (C) Enthusiasts who find this beer should expect to dish out between $6.50 -$8.00 for the beer on average (Legacy sold it for $6.25 per beer). This is right about in-line with what I would expect for a “world-class” offering. They are hard to acquire and a bit of a splurge, but well worth “bombing” your wallet for. 3,515 charactersTheCraftBrewReview, Feb 06, 2015

4.66/5  rDev +4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.7512 oz bottle served slightly chilled intoa tulip glass.
Aroma is immediately appreciated as soon as the bottle is opened. The smell of a rich, full-bodied stout with subtle but noticible hints of chili.
Appearance is very dark brown in color with thick tan colored head. It settles gradually and leaves lots of spotty lacing on the glass.
Back to that aroma, the smell of roasted malts, roasted chills, coffee, and vanilla all come forward.
Flavor is unique and complex with great balance and depth. Sweetness of chocolate and vanilla come through first followed by the coffee and chilis. The heat is subtle but noticible and it lingers just a bit. 
Mouthfeel is creamy smooth, full in body, nicely carbonated, and good balance of flavors. The spiciness is well judged.
Overall an amazing stout. I'm anot usually one for chilis in my beer but this one really hits the mark. 879 charactersGilGarp, Feb 05, 2015

4.12/5  rDev -8%look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Side-by-side with Hunahpu's and Abraxas. I rank it third among the three, however it is far from disappointing! As it warms the flavors become more present. Less spice among the three, which is what I was seeking out. Cinnamon would be a good addition. Great coffee flavors, hints of chocolate and a very mild heat from the chilis. Not overpowering or lingering. The 12oz bottle is perfect for a solo drink. 407 charactersTigheC, Feb 04, 2015

Green chilies come on giving just the right amount of burn without crowding out the other flavors. Found the body to be medium, not as thick as i would have expected but that's probably due to the chili pepper. Very good stuff. 328 characterspapat444, Feb 02, 2015

4.96/5  rDev +10.7%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5Poured a dark color with minimal brown head. You can smell the vanilla and cacao with a bit of spice at the end. The flavor follows suit as you get a sweetness up front as the spice kicks in at the end. The two play nice together with a good amount of alcohol. Easy to drink but you know you're drinking a big beer. The feel is very smooth almost like syrup, almost like there is no carbonation. This is one of my favorite beers to get every year and I buy in multiples to set aside. This one has been sitting for a few months and I can't wait to try another in a few more. 573 charactersMeyers1023, Feb 01, 2015
4.66/5  rDev +4%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.75Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a snifter glass.  Bottle puts the batch at 13.0% ABV.
Poured jet black with minimal head.
Rich, roasted coffee aroma mixed with a pure cocoa scent.  Hints of spiciness.
Strong coffee flavors accompanied by a fair amount of peppery spiciness. A mild chocolate flavor.  The aftertaste is dominated by the coffee notes.  The alcohol content is hidden very well by the rich flavor.
Nice creamy mouthfeel with a significant amount of carbonation.
A very good beer with tons of flavor.  The spiciness and roasty coffee flavors play off one another nicely and serve to mask the 13% ABV.  It definitely ranks near the top of my stout list. 668 characters10Crumra, Feb 01, 2015

Slight vanilla and chili peppers, but very very slight. Mouthfeel is silky smooth and goes down very easy at this abv level, especially with coffee. Coffee and dark chocolate/cacao bitterness remain in the aftertaste, but both sit well on the palate. A truly world-class and classic imperial coffee stout. 380 charactersmig100, Jan 30, 2015

Aroma of 90% dark chocolate, rich black coffee, some alcohol, and medium roasted malts.  The taste is exactly the same.  On the back end there is light lactose and a little milk chocolate.  The chili lingers in the background and is barely noticeable.  In the mouth, this feels rich, with low/medium carb.  The body is very substantial, just how I like it.  This is a man's drink.  The finish is clean...Very clean.
Overall, this deserves the posted accumulative scores.  Excellent stuff.

Smell: Quite coffee and chocolate dominated, faint smell of chilies and vanilla.
Taste:  Very heavy on the the coffee, chocolate and vanilla, subtle hints of chill here and there.  After taste of chills and vanilla hangs around after your sip.  Not sure where the 13% hides on this beer, not boozy at all.
Feel: Not as thick tasting as I would have thought from the poor, quite smooth actually.  Aftertaste of chilli and vanilla does linger in your mouth, but is quite delicious.
Overall: Very balanced beer considering everything that has went into this.  Crazy how you get such strong smells but the taste comes out much difference. Very excited this beer finally is available in my home town. 820 charactersCorson, Jan 20, 2015

Pours pitch dark black.  Thick flavor of espresso followed by the chocolate, vanilla and coconut but more espresso than anything.   No where near as thick or chewy in the mouth as you would expect.  Goes down more like espresso than rum.  High ABV but the beer gets overwhelmed by coffee grounds.   Batch 1 was almost pure espresso and underwhelming. 457 charactersuvachief, Jan 12, 2015

A  looks black enough, deep cola edge, two fingers of mocha head quickly cuts itself in half than retains fairly well leaving lots of random lace, some wide legs after a swirl once everything fell 
S  heavy on the chocolate and coco, faint vanilla, lots of coffee, more chocolate, I normally don't get much pepper in chilli stouts but I'm picking it up in this one, it is what it claims in a big way
T  less chocolate and the coffee really come out to play, some char, faint licorice, not much vanilla, still has some chilli going on, burnt espresso rinds as it airs out, I have no idea where the 13% is hiding
M  not as thick as I'd guess but there's enough bubbles to fluff it up a little, a little oily on the palate, very little heat for such a strong beer but some faint chilli heat, and heavy coffee and char linger strong for ages 
O  the hypes real with this one, the adjuncts they use are hard to miss and work well together and the booze is nearly invisible, fairly impressive for a biggin 
I'm not sure if I want to age this on as its drinking great fresh, the coffee works well and I'm not sure if I'd want it to fade, not much booze fresh either, oh well I'll find out anyways because I'm stocking up 1,258 characterswordemupg, Jan 11, 2015

A: Arrived as a dark black brew capped with a relatively thin dark brown head. Left decent lacing on the glass.
S: Unfortunately, I was at a restaurant, which messes with my sense of smell. What I was able to detect was a serious dose of coffee, with spicy hot pepper notes.
T: Oddly, exactly as the aroma I was able to detect, more or less. Coffee strikes right up front and does not relent, a type that tastes like pure black, undiluted, super dark roast - like a shade darker than French roasts. Hot pepper spiciness rides alongside the coffee, eventually taking over near the finish to transform the flavor experience from coffee bitter to spicy heat. There are some vague hints of dark chocolate that manifest here and there, and the base malt taste is that of a charred-black roasted bill, which simply adds to the coffee bitter.
M: Heavy and thick, this is definitely an imperial stout.
O: Wildly unbalanced, at least to my tastes, as almost all I got was the double-hit of dark coffee and chiles. I can see where the infatuation with beers that feature one or two huge flavors to blow your face off gets this beer its high marks, but it's probably not a repeater for me. 1,249 charactersUrbanCaveman, Jan 10, 2015

S: Nice RIS/American Double Stout nose that's full of coffee. Also cocoa powder and a hint of both the vanilla and the hot pepper.
T: Pretty much follows the nose: big, roasty malt and coffee up front, then some chocolate malt and cocoa powder near the finish. Smoky, peppery spice is at the back of the palate, but not overwhelming. Spice lingers in the aftertaste.  Alcohol heat is felt on the way to the belly. 
M: Thick in body, carbonation is modest. 
O: Very-good-to-excellent. 651 charactersKendo, Jan 09, 2015

Stout glass pour: Jet black, and while I'm missing much head, the lacing ring is a darker rust color than I've ever seen before. 4
Smells fantastic enough. Chocolate nibs, freshly ground coffee, hints of licorice and the chile pepper. 
This is a bomb alright. Big hits of coffee and a bitter burning, and a slick, oily mouthfeel. Whether it's THE bomb, I remain reserved (THE as in at least my top 3 of the style). 
Chocolate flavor hits up front and I notice it the longer it sits. After awhile this reminds me of a regular breakfast stout as far as coffee goodness, but stronger with a chile spice pop, a pop that has distinct character. Powdery chocolatey chewy mouthfeel. Well rounded all-in-all. While normally chile in beer would be a drawback for my tastes, this is done right. I still prefer a sweet rounded stout as opposed to a sharper spicy one, however I think with this creation, most anyone would find something to enjoy about it. What did work with this the first time was some ice cream (Great beer float material. Vanilla I hear is recommended, although I did well with Guinness gelato (yes, the beer)). 
This tasting, however, is with no paired food. Just sipping this on a Texas night with temps headed down to 18F. Not much a better choice. 1,369 charactersTBoneJones, Jan 08, 2015

Prairie Ales wonderfully displayed the difference between brewing excellence and average joe.
Beautiful blend of flavors that work very well together. The chocolate, vanilla and cacao nibs combine and work to enhance the chili flavor which is just enough to enojoy and appreciate the uniqueness but not overwhelm the palette. 463 charactersAustin32, Jan 06, 2015
4.87/5  rDev +8.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75This beer is exceptional. Poured into snifter glass. Jet black with no translucence while pouring. Appeared viscous and rich with minimal head. Aromas were dominantly peppers. It was smokey, festive and somewhat charred. Also tons of chocolate. Upon sipping this, I instantly tasted the chilies. Its perfect, the spiciness is present but not overpowering like many other spicy beers. It hangs around in the mouth and quickly fades away before you take another sip. Also pick up plenty of chocolatly goodness.  Its thick and full bodied. Overall this beer is incredible. Everything is perfect with exception the coffee seems to be bit faded. Probably because there's just so much flavor that I'm not skilled enough to pick up the coffee. 736 charactersBenish, Jan 06, 2015

4.59/5  rDev +2.5%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5No bottle date, orange wax (13%.) Megan bought it for me when she went to Oklahoma in Julyish of this year. It's been out of the fridge for about an hour now
Pours pitch black with a thin layer of dark brown foam that receded to a ring pretty quickly. Really mild carbonation, pretty good lacing
Smells of spicy espresso and dark chocolate with notes of vanilla, toffee, caramel, cinnamon, and alcohol. The peppers really compliment everything well, almost like Mexican hot chocolate
Taste definitely delivers. Really strong kick with the coffee and chocolate, finishing with  vanilla, cinnamon, and caramel. Alcohol is present but subtle 
Feel is incredibly thick and spicy, also incredibly smooth for the abv. Perfect amount of spice from the chillies to play off the other flavors
Overall this is an incredibly well made beer. Definitely lives up to the hype, definitely something I'm going to trade for 911 characterslordofstarside, Dec 25, 2014

Taste is much more subdued than I expected. Initial flavors of dry cocoa and coffee are upfront...then some of the barrel character across the middle with light vanilla, dry oak and a slight bourbon. The spice from the peppers provides little heat, which isn’t a bad thing necessarily. The thinner mouthfeel for the style, coupled with a dry/slightly chalky impression, makes this beer easy to drink. Good beer, but seems to lack the robust and bold flavors of some of the other imperial stouts. 579 charactersClownoisseur, Dec 25, 2014

S- smells very nice and malty, can pick up slight Choco coffee notes.
T- Wow this is really delicious, didn't taste the chilis on the initial sip. Took a few sips to get fully adjusted to all that's going on in this glass and it is fantastic. The coffee is up front definitely with the vanilla following shortly with the cacao and aggressively leading into that delicious chili spice on the back end. Really well done beer here.
Mouthfeel- a little heavy on the carbonation but doesn't take away from the beer, overall it's two thumbs up in my book. Cheers! 686 charactersWadeBridgman, Dec 17, 2014

Note:  Try to age this beer for at least a year.  I noticed a very favorable difference between the aged and fresh Prairie Bomb.  The chili peppers are less pronounced in the aged beer. 669 charactersFalcon91Wolvrn03, Dec 15, 2014

A: Looks amazing: rich, velvety black with bright ruby tones. The head is dark brown with more of those ruby and crimson tones. Just a great looking beer.
S: Burnt coffee, baker's chocolate, and a light fruitiness, which I'm guessing is from the peppers. Just not a lot going on here.
T: Heavy on bitter dark chocolate, molasses, and tar. Not getting any coffee or vanilla, though I think some of the silky mouthfeel is owing to the vanilla beans. No heat whatsoever. Burnt, bitter tar bomb!
M: On the heavier side of medium bodied.
O: I wasn't a fan of this beer, which tastes a lot like what Founder's Breakfast Stout would taste like if you added a bunch of tar and cheap, burnt coffee from the gas station. Given the overwhelmingly positive reviews here, however, I'd be interested in trying it again. 875 charactersblankenhoney, Dec 11, 2014

Pretty easy to down this one with little effort. My brother who has been shying away from stouts recently was totally impressed with Prairie Bomb, as was I.  This will be one brew that I will continue to try to get more of for sure. 411 charactersricknelson, Dec 05, 2014

Lots going on with this beer. Very robust! 
Look: Black as any stout you have ever seen. Big frothy brown head, which took a while to settle, even then it hung around a bit. Interesting for a 13% beer. 
Aroma: Big bold flavors, very earthy. Coffee and earthy peppers dominate the bouquet. I did not notice the vanilla all that much but the cocoa did come through. 
Taste: It is an almost overwhelming experience. I have not really had a stout that tasted like this one. It is not sweet at all, very bitter and biting. The peppers are there, not overpowering but they do linger. It has a dark earthiness to it, I assume its from the peppers, it is like you can taste the dirt they from which they grew. Coffee is also bold and strong. It's intense. It is also something that would be best shared with someone, because even though this is only a 12oz beer. That is enough! Dark chocolates are also there. This is not a very refined beer in that regard. But, that is what I liked about it. Its a challenge impressive really.
Overall: This is one of only a handful of chili stouts I have tried and this one is definitely bold. I could probably drink Xocoveza all the time, this is a once in a while kind of brew. It it impressive nonetheless and I am happy I had the opportunity to try it. Still not found a 5 beer, but this one is damn close. My only complaint is that it was a bit thin on the mouthfeel, not really thin necessarily, but for the alcohol and flavor profile it would be amazing if it was a bit more viscous, I believe it would totally be a 100 beer or damn close, if it were. 1,699 charactershumuloner22, Nov 30, 2014

S--espresso, cocoa, vanilla.  With the 14% ABV I expected to smell the booze or some bourbon but was happy to find the alcohol was not present in the nose
T--chocolate and vanilla is present from the beginning but its certainly not sweet.  Chile peppers at the end bring together a nice, well balanced beer that lives up to the hype
M--medium body, more carbonation than I expected but very nice
O--Excellent stuff.  I was super-impressed with this beer.  So many imperial stouts carrying a 14% ABV are barely drinkable.  This beer is incredibly well done and I would be happy to get my hands on another one.  Well done. 671 charactersTbub18, Nov 30, 2014

I like a good coffee stout though so I was okay with that. There did seem to be a little bit of "a kick" in the nose though and that might have been the pepper coming through. Nice and drinkable for 13% abv.
EDIT-Had it on tap and it was absolutely fantastic. It reminded me a lot of Abraxas and I certainly didn't get any kind of coffee taste. I am upping this rating by quite a bit. 466 charactersmjpolzin, Nov 29, 2014

A- pours motor oil black with a small dark tan creamy & foamy head that reduces to a ring around the edges with some short lasting lace and alcohol legs upon agitation
S- robust roasted malt aroma with a big hit of smoky/charred wood, followed by deep aromas of dark artisanal chocolate, espresso beans, walnut, vanilla beans & dark fruits.  There is a whipped cream-like sweetness that kicks in.  Picking up slight heat on the nose, but it honestly seems from the alcohol and not so much the chili    
T- The flavor of the chili hits the palate first, immediately followed by lots of dark chocolate with fresh herbal & earthy coffee flavor.  The addition of the vanilla beans seems to enhance the chocolate & coffee, notes of caramel & dark fruits follow.  I'm not really picking up any heat from the chills, but the flavors are there.  More bitter chocolate and coffee on the finish 
M- medium body with medium low carbonation leads to a foamy mouthfeel and a creamy, slightly warming finish.  Pretty drinkable for 14% ABV
O- The coffee is infused brilliantly and meshes with the other adjuncts almost flawlessly.  The only thing I would have like to see more of was a bit more heat form the chills. 1,253 charactersTreyliff, Nov 27, 2014

3.5/5  rDev -21.9%8 ounce pour - $6.50 at Argosy in Atlanta, Georgia.
Appearance: Dark brown, near black body with a frothed up, dark beige-hued head.
Smell: Blackened brackish roasted maltiness, dark chocolate powder. Dark fruits. The vegetal tones from the chiles is noted, as is the solvent alcohol quality.
Taste: Sugar infused chocolate, with harsh, ashen coffee, black molasses, and a little soft touch of vanilla. Dark fruitiness. A 'pop' of accumulating chile pepper heat. Hard roastiness on the chile-touched, hot finish with the spiciness (and alcohol) lingering into the aftertaste.
Mouthfeel: Near full body. Medium carbonation.
Overall: The bomb isn't a dud, but, frankly, I was surprised at its overwhelming reception online. Really, I was thankful it was only eight ounces. Though, that's just one beer monkey's opinion, which is in the minority. 848 charactersChainGangGuy, Nov 27, 2014

T: Tasted a coffee bitterness and that was about it.  Not able to taste the vanilla, chocolate, or chili.
M:  A bit on the bitter side, coming from the coffee.  No real sweetness.  Alcohol was very well hidden.  Could not pick up on it at all.
O:  Disappointed more than anything else.  Was really looking forward to tasting this guy after all the positive reviews.  It was an okay beer, but not really impressed with it.

Orange wax dipped top
Served in a snifter
The oily, viscous, jet black liquid was topped by an inch tall, frothy, creamy and tight, saddle brown head. The crown quickly fell to a thin ring. Spotty drops of lacing trickled down the glass.
Intense coffee ground notes dominated the aroma initially. Deep, dark and rich. Super roasty. Cold coffee was perhaps also noticeable. The roast was countered by a robust, caramel and brown sugar-like sweetness. Dark chocolate notes were apparent. A hint of vanilla came through as well. The vanilla presence became more intense as the beer warmed.
The flavor profile was super roasty and quite bitter. Coffee notes came through strong on the front end. Again, coffee grounds and/or cold coffee came to mind. There was a slight metallic quality as well, but it soon dissipated. Vanilla was noticeable. Lots of spicy chili heat on the back end. The beer finished rather bitter with strong ashy notes and a lingering hoppy bitterness. At first, I thought that there was an intense boozy note on the finish, but later I discovered that the hotness was from the chili peppers.
The mouthfeel was thick and creamy but not super heavy. Slick, frothy and palate coating. The liquid contained a fine, mellow effervescence. Almost a bit milkshake-like.
I am typically a sucker for big, coffee-infused imperial stouts, but Prairie Bomb! was a bit of a letdown. The roast in this beer was quite overstated and the chilis were too intense for my liking. Toward the end of the session, I definitely felt a fire in my belly. Since there is supposedly a lot of variation in this beer between batches, I would definitely like to give it another try in the future. 1,754 charactersDamian, Nov 21, 2014

Heavy aroma of black coffee and roasted malt.  Undertones of vanilla, chocolate, and molasses.  Hints of chili pepper.  Background notes grow stronger as the beer warms.  
Big blend of flavors which are well balanced.  Black coffee and vanilla first.  Chili pepper is much more pronounced than in the nose.  Bitter chocolate, dark roasted malt, molasses, and sweet cream.  
Thick and sludgy mouth feel.  Mild carbonation.  Heat from the chilies linger though mild overall.  Gets a touch syrupy as it warms.  Boozy alcohol warmth though less than the 14.0 abv might suggest.
Excellent full bodied and full flavored Imperial Stout.  Flavors are well balanced.  Mouth feel could use some improvement as the bit of syrupyness isn't to my liking.  Abraxas is my favorite of the beers that use similar adjuncts but this is still excellent overall. 972 charactersleroybrown10, Nov 20, 2014

A- Pitch black, thick oily body poured from the stubby to a wine glass; well actually four. A small tan head rises up to half a finger or so with a frothy texture. A very small ring remains and lacing is mostly spotty.
S- Very roasty and pretty much burnt grains dominate the nose with an espresso/super dark coffee feel as well. Vanilla sweetness helps to buffer the roastiness just a bit but it certainly is a bomb of roast malts. Veggie pepper hint comes into play later on.
T- For me, this is one of the most roasty and charred grain brews I have ever had. The finish pretty much defines black with a barrage of espresso, coffee bean, chocolate, ash and heavily toasted nuts. The peppers are quite flavorful but only a bit of heat on the back end. Vanilla dessert feel on the back end rounding it all out.
MF- Thick bodied with a fairly chewy and creamy consistency. Carbonation is at a fairly high level for the style but the texture takes the edge off of it. Finishes warm from the peppers and with an intense roast bitterness.
Lots of huge flavors brought to the table here and somehow they end up working out together. Chiles are flavorful and a bit warm and integrate smoothly with the massive espresso and sweet vanilla at the end. This is my kind of dessert. Also, insanely roasty... like burnt in a good way. 1,476 characterscbutova, Nov 16, 2014

Appearance:  completely black with a thin layer of dark brown foam atop.  Highly attractive.
Smell:  sweet with a great chocolate character and a good coffee aroma.  Subtler complexities are also hidden under these stronger elements.  I'm intrigued.
Taste:  strong coffee right off the bat with lots of rich, sweet roastiness underneath.  The fruitier complexities are indeed subtle, but present.  A delicious elixir.
Mouthfeel:  rich body with a nice texture and a good carbonation yielding a good creaminess.  Wonderful.

S: Not a strong smell like I expected, a hint of vanilla and very slight hint of coffee, some dankness, some wood
T: smooth, a little boozy when unaged, complex, vanilla leads to chocolate, coffee, peppers at the end
M:  Smooth with a slight bitterness and alcohol burn at the end
O:  Very good.  Unaged the first time I had it and would love to age this.  Incredibly complex but boozy, need to get a few and age.  A little mellowness and this beer will be amazing 507 charactersDwkasper, Nov 09, 2014
4.75/5  rDev +6%Aroma: Coffee, slightly boozy, smells rich. Not much hop aroma showing through. 11/12
Appearance: Poured vigorously into a porter/stout glass from a 12oz bottle. About a half finger thick, off-white/tan head settled into a thin layer of foam. The beer is inky black and completely opaque. 3/3
Flavor: Complex. Creamy "half & half" taste from the vanilla beans as the sip his the tongue. Bitter chocolate and slight hot of the chillies in the middle. Coffee makes an appearance as you exhale after swallowing the sip and lingers in the aftertaste. 20/20
Mouthfeel: Full-bodied and thick. Carbonation is light but is appropriate for the style. The alcohol and chillies combine to warm the mouth without being "hot". 5/5
Overall: I was excited to see this made its way to my local beverage center. I was less thrilled with the $9 price. Price point aside, this is an excellent example of a true-to-style Imperial Russian Stout. That being said, this is not my favorite style, and at $9 per bottle, I don't see myself ever buying this again. I'm glad to have tried it, though. 9/10

Thick, pitch black pour with a nice two finger caramel-colored head that fades quickly with minimal lacing.  The nose is absolutely huge and complex, dominated by big roasty coffee and surprisingly strong chili notes.  Hints of dark chocolate, cocoa, vanilla, espresso, and leather.  The taste mirrors the nose with all the featured elements sharing the spotlight equally.  Huge roasty coffee with fudgy dark chocolate, cocoa, espresso, chilies, and vanilla.  The mouthfeel is thick, creamy, and mouth-coating with incredible balance and huge drinkability with subtle chili heat on the finish.  Overall, this beer delivers in every way. All the advertised elements were bold, yet equally represented with over the top drinkability.  Right up there with Abraxas.  Highly recommended! 821 charactersbeerdrifter, Nov 06, 2014

4.3/5  rDev -4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25We crack a bottle, pouring into our St. Bernardus goblets.  The pour puts forth a murky beer of the deepest root beer browns.  It holds a half finger tall head of cakey but thickly oiled bubbles the color of creamed espresso.  Retention is brief, again, settling into this oily film.  Lacing is ridged and sheeted.  No haze or sediment is appreciated, and carbonation appears to be moderate, although the bubbles rise slowly in the muck.  The aroma is explosive of raw coffee beans, dense and powdered cacao, richly singed and roasty chocolate and black maltiness, tobacco smokiness, bright acidity, harsh coiny metallics, cooling vanilla bean, white sugar sweetness, brandy-soaked figs, gentle floral hoppiness, cooked cereal grainy grit, perfumed potpourri, hollow hot chili seediness, hearty bready yeastiness, celery vegetals, and waxy lipstick smear.  The flavoring is crazily bittering and acidic; it is very unlike the picture conjured up by the aroma.  The things that take center stage are the coffee and unsweetened raw cacao.  These alone put the pucker level through the roof.  Otherwise you meet notes of hot coffee acid, chemical extract of vanilla, hot and salty booziness that speaks somehow of bourbon, gentle green chili pepper heat, biscuity butters, sourdough bread yeastiness, muddy mineral, raw plum skin and juiciness, powdered cinnamon, grainy grit of rye, tannic barley, and charcoal-blackened chocolate malts, black licorice, and icy metallic coolness.  The body is maximally full, and the carbonation is medium.  Each sip offers pleasant slurp, smack, cream, and froth.  The mouth is oiled, with a subtle chili burn finally leeching onto the palate.  This makes for a fiery astringency once settled.  The abv is up there, but not obtrusive enough to hinder drinkability.  The enormity of the beer keeps it as a sipper regardless.
Overall, we’ve been hugely excited for this beer, and are wonderfully grateful to have found it when we did.  We were honestly not sure if we would truly ever get a chance to try it, actually, as our timing as of late seems to have been perfect for always missing it.  Alas, here we are, and what a massive beer it is!!  We were actually taken aback here.  From the description of the ingredients the base beer was aged over, and the sweeter aroma, we were so, so surprised at what a bitter flavoring was presented.  If anything, this simply acts to slow the drinker down so that they can savor each sip.  This bitterness is primarily in the form of acidic coffee bean roastiness, cacao, and yeasty metallics.  All of the inclusions blend expertly together, but each of them are powerful enough to stand on their own, at the center of their own beer.  Actually, the chili peppers are rather subdued.  This was likely intentional, so as to produce the most widely marketable beer.  Not just something chili-heads like us would seek out for the heat.  This is a super-duper beer, and amongst the most serious and thoroughly top-quality we’ve ever come across. 3,019 charactersTheBrewo, Nov 04, 2014

Location: Halftime Mamaroneck
Draught/Bottle: Bottle
Glassware: Snifter
Appearance: Black until it's edging where it reaches a very dark brown. Mocha colored one inch head on a regular pour without much retention. Slight alcohol viscous cling very little carbonation cling. 
Aroma: A power blend of ancho peppers, spicy, mildly hot bordering on freshly vegetal, with a rich coffee not overly bitter but roasted, vanilla and sweet cocoa. 
Taste: The coffee is the first flavor on my tongue as I get a nice roasting, followed by the peppers which taste almost like sweet peppers. At the end I get a light chocolate to help with the spice and some vanilla. 
Mouthfeel: Medium to Med high in body which is surprising. I would have thought this beer needed to have more heft to carry the weight if it's ingredients. Medium carbonation. The best part of the beer is how the ancho warms the tongue and the back of the throat after the beer has been swallowed.

A- Dark black and very thick.  Tiny khaki head that quickly disappeared.  Very mild carbonation and lacing present.
S-  Lots of coffee and mocha on the nose.  Smooth smell of vanilla milkshake mixed in and lots of toasted oats and malts.  Smells like a delicious dessert with a side of caffeine.  Not much smell of the peppers.
T-  As the nose indicates, there's a good amount of coffee, expresso, and chocolate up front.   The coffee and chocolate is followed by sticky molasses and smokey, burnt malts.  All of this turns into a beautiful light heat down the throat from the peppers and booziness.
M-  Very full bodied and creamy.  The stickiness compliments the dryness of this stout, much like the sweetness compliment the heat.  Very little carbonation and I let mine hit almost room temp so it rolled right over the tongue leaving plenty of flavor behind.
O-  Possibly the best coffee, cocoa, and pepper stout I've had to date.  The flavors are all bold and complex, but come together perfect on the aftertaste.  This one comes highly recommended and is another winner from Prairie Artisan.  Just wish I had an endless supply for the colder months. 1,192 charactersEveningCordial, Oct 29, 2014

The smell was chocolatey with metal and chili pepper notes.
The taste was robust. Chocolate and peppery. Cherry richness. Both tart and sweet but drying enough to never be cloying. The alcohol was hidden and this one was very drinkable. 
The body was full and creamy. I would not hesitate to buy this one again. 542 charactersCresant, Oct 28, 2014

Flavor is boozy initially, with lots of vanilla and bourbon. Then, the spice and dark chocolate kick in mid palate, with light sweetness contrasting the pepper notes, which provide a touch of heat in the dry, toasted, roasty bitter finish. Very complex brew. Very smooth and drinkable for the abv. 412 charactersbarczar, Oct 07, 2014

S- deeply roasted, arguably burnt coffee, with some raw green chile e.g. Pasilla or poblano. Honestly, between the coffee and pepper, I get a pretty unpleasant black olive flavor.
T- better than the nose, but not much. Strong coffee w very mild chile, and some roasted malt. Nothing resembling chocolate or vanilla. Not quite the same black olive flavor in the nose, but the clash between the chiles and the coffee is not terribly pleasant. 
MF- Thin, even for a regular stout. Very slippery. One plus is that the alcohol is very well hidden, would not have told you this was 13% at all. 
O- In light of the high regard for this beer, I have to wonder if something was wrong/off with the bottle I got. I let it scale in temp from 45 to probably 65 degrees, hoping it would open up a bit, but not much changed.  If my bottle is at all indicative of what this beer is all about, I'm shockingly underwhelmed. I'm curious if some age could bring this all together, perhaps by dulling the coffee notes, but that would take quite the transformation. 1,117 charactersMimDIPA, Oct 06, 2014

A - We have ourselves a spent motor-oil coloration and consistency and a dark tan head that, even with a vigorous pour, gives way pretty quickly with only a bit of lacing. 
S - The nose on this bastard is bracing, with more than the chocolate/coffee/soy sauce mélange one expects from imperial stouts. The base aroma is similar to Oskar Blues’ Ten Fidy or Bell’s Expedition Stout (two beers I love) but it’s wrapped in cigar smoke and leather, butterscotch, honey and mesquite. 
T - An intense espresso and cherry cordial flavor with a fair amount of dark chocolate, figs and roasted black marshmallow. Bomb! is sweet, yes, but not saccharine. And the burn from those ancho chilis cauterizes any lingering sugar, leaving only a delightful coffee ground aftertaste. 
M - The weight is definitely heavy, but manageable for a stout this robust. Also boozy as hell, which makes me happy that it's distributed in 12 oz. bottles.
This is a wonderful Mayan stout, though it doesn't unseat Mexican Cake as my all-purpose touchstone of the style. Nonetheless, I'm keeping my eyes open for this the next time I'm in the OK/TX area. 1,171 charactersTheCuriograph, Oct 02, 2014

A:  Beautiful pour with a dark tan head.  So black you can’t see the sun through it.  A perfect stout pour.
S:  This beer smells brutal.  It smells hot!  Very boozy, very spicy!  Underlying base smell is that of confectioners chocolate.  Smells like a big bold stout as was expected.
T:  Tastes like biting into a dark chocolate chile bar.  Very prominent dark chocolate and very mild chile flavor.  The chile flavor is almost sweet.  The burn starts to get to you the longer you drink.  The taste does not quite reflect the aroma.  The aroma implies that it is much spicier than it actually is.  Dark chocolate bitter aftertaste.
F:  Great mouthfeel, just enough carbonation that it is a thick, sticky beer, but still feels like a beer and not like drinking black chocolate syrup.  
O:  I will not be trading for this beer or intentionally seeking it out again, but if I happen to walk into a store and it’s on the shelf, I will very much consider paying $7 a bottle for it. 1,045 charactersViperman1316, Oct 01, 2014

A - Obsidian and coal colored with a thin half finger brown head. Fades into very thin ring and leaves traces of lacing. 
S - Notes of roasted malt and bakers chocolate initially followed by the chilies. I am fighting to find the vanilla, but it is muted most likely due to age. Missing are the caramel and vanilla aromas .
T - A good amount of roasted malts and bakers chocolate is quickly overcome by the chilies. I guess you could say my palate is sensitive to chilies as they cover up any other other notes of this beer. No vanilla and caramel. The flavor is still nice, but falls a bit short of outstanding.
M - Thick and rich feel that really coats the palate.The chilies give a warming sensation to the entire mouth and throat, but it is not very hot. 
O - This is good and if you like chilies you will rate this higher than I did. I also didn't find much of the vanilla in this beer, but the alcohol was very well hidden. 978 charactersRi0, Sep 21, 2014

4.71/5  rDev +5.1%A: 5 - Pitch black with a dark brown/cinnamon head. Looks a lot like the Bible Belt I had last week. Tremendous looking beer.
S: 4.6- A LOT of chocolate, some vanilla, roasted malt. I pick up on a little bit of the chili. The coffee is also definitely there. Smells wonderful! 
T: 4.75 - Omg. That's awesome. CHOCOLATE! Dark chocolate up front, and I actually pick up on the chili. Some people I know were saying they missed the chili on this but I'm really getting some which makes me...very happy. The coffee is very faint, as is the vanilla. There's a lot there. For a 14% beer I only get a tiny bit of the alcohol. Clearly a big beer, but I never would have guessed 14% off the taste. Wonderful.
M: 4.5 - Again, the ABV is high but this is fairly drinkable. There is some burn in the throat on the way down but nothing extreme.
O: 4.71 - Awesome beer. Being from Texas I naturally (ignorantly) despise mostly everything to do with Oklahoma, but damn that's a good beer. REALLY good beer. It's certainly the bomb! This beer goes for around $25/4 pack in my area, which I feel is just a little steep. It's an awesome beer, though, and I think you get more "bomb" for the buck with this over Bible Belt. Good, good stuff. Woo pig. 1,235 charactersREGreenBTRB, Sep 20, 2014

4.65/5  rDev +3.8%Poured into a Funky Buddha Brewery snifter.  Orange waxed bottle.
A- Pours a totally opaque black color with a 1/2 inch medium brown head that retains a bit before becoming a thin ring around the edge of the glass and minimal surface foam.  Nearly no lacing.
S- Semi-sweet aroma of dark chocolate, vanilla and coffee.  Also kind of nutty and the smell of the chilies certainly comes through as well.  
T- What a lovely synthesis of chocolate, vanilla, coffee and the perfect amount of heat from the peppers.  The layered complexity is fully realized and appreciated after every sip.  The ABV is superbly well-hidden making it oh so dangerously drinkable.  Even with all the different elements at play, the cacao nibs and dark roasted malt end up being the main flavor components with all else being complementary.
M- Creamy yet with a considerable amount of tingle from the chilies.  After multiple sips, a capsaicin burn starts to build in the back of the throat but it's not unpleasant.  Medium-low carbonation and a full body.
O- Simply fantastic.  Probably my favorite non-BA stout. 1,091 charactersImmortale25, Sep 17, 2014

4.5/5  rDev +0.4%Got a few these in a trade recently and plan to cellar the others. 
a: Poured straight down the glass, black with a thin brown head. Looks really thick.
s: CHOCOLATE! I get much more chocolate on the nose that the chills or coffee.
t: Again i get heavy chocolate on the front. The coffee adds a nice flavor. The chills are very mild. This isn't a spicy beer and the chills give a nice flavor as the beer goes down the throat. You definitely cannot taste that 14%abv
M: Thick and full mouth feel. Not very carbed which adds to the chocolate flavor
O: Amazing. Honestly one of the best imperial stouts Ive had. Unlike other chili stouts this one is all about balance and delivery an amazing beer not just a different experience. I could drink this everyday. Looking forward to crushing this in the depths of winter. 825 charactersMWilcox20, Sep 09, 2014

4.9/5  rDev +9.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 512oz Brown bottle with no wax so was probably bottled spring of 2014.  Poured into a snifter.
Appearance:  Pours dark as motor oil with a tan head that recedes into a thin ring
Smell: Chocolate, coffee, vanilla and a whole lot of roasted aroma
Taste: An incredible blend of all the flavors mentioned in the aroma with a well balanced spice throughout
Mouthfeel: Creamy and just thick enough; the carbonation really tickles the tongue
Overall:  I've had this a few times on draft and now I'm excited to crack a bottle to review.  This is perhaps still the only chili beer I have had that I will enjoy to have again.  Upon opening the bottle you are quickly greeted by all the ingredients with aromas of chocolate, coffee, and vanilla beans with all these working in perfect unison.  This is even more demonstrated in the flavor with a blend of all these with a persistent chili spice that is persistent throughout and stays right in the back of your mouth.  Most impressive is how hidden the alcohol is with little to no booziness in the finish. 1,049 charactersTuck_leepulin, Sep 09, 2014

Taste is very coffee forward, creamy. As it warms up, the chilli begins to come out. Not my thing . Becomes very bitter as well. The chilli is a little too much.

4.75/5  rDev +6%While I'm not normally a fan of stouts, this one is really amazing. It pours coffee dark and the smells of all of espresso, chocolate, and vanilla instantly make themselves known. The tastes of all of these are there along with a nice warm taste of chili peppers. 
The mouth feel is good, with a heavier carbonation, and a thick, creamy body.

4.3/5  rDev -4%Thank you very much for this one, Jason! Pours a viscous, complete black color, with a small, soon diminishing brown head. 
Intoxicating aromas of fresh crushed coffee beans, melted dark-chocolate, tobacco, hints of gentle vanilla, also scorched caramel and rock sugar accompanied by roasted malts. 
Has a very creamy, chocolate defined beginning, with earthy, calming malts, which maintain the balance of this brew, as sweet molasse, caramel and pungent tobacco come up, to form a very convincing, smooth start. Then, soon, uncompromising, burned coffee bean notes get detectable, which counter the established, rich, earthy sweetness by adding an almost dry bitterness to the beer, while hot chili peppers lend a hot, spicy background depth. This spicy sting stays on the back of the palate till the very end, altough the beer finishes with great chocolate qualities, blended with bitter coffee tones. Complex, slick and smooth in the mouth, a full-bodied, fantastic beer. 976 charactersaleigator, Sep 01, 2014

4.35/5  rDev -2.9%Very good, smooth and drinkable stout. Complex flavor profile, but the peppers come on a bit too strong at the end, not allowing the other flavors to linger as one would like. Still, this is an excellent beer and worthy of its lofty reputation. I have had it on tap and from the bottle. Consistently good and probably the best beer I have tried with spicier than average peppers added. I had it once with food (Peruvian food) and it went very well. 448 charactersWobbly, Aug 31, 2014

Smells amazing! Huge chocolate smell, hints of vanilla, roasted notes, pours very little head. A lot of carbonation... First sip taste a nice roasted chocolate, light bodied and the peppers come in full on the back end. Surprising light bodied for a 13% ABV. I do wish it was a bit thicker. Notch below Mexican Cake and I have yet to try Huna. I am glad I have 1 more bottle left 440 charactersJWQ, Aug 23, 2014

After the first sip of this stout I realized that I underestimated the ingredients. Never have been a fan of pepper added to my beers but this one had the perfect emulsion of pepper, cacao nibs, and a hint of vanilla. As the title explains the flavor, an explosion of flavors graces your tongue with an imperial finish. Nice golden head with a dark chocolate body. Highly recommend this! 461 charactersStandupandStout, Aug 16, 2014

S - oh my. So there's definitely coffee and cocoa. Then vanilla, not vanilla oak notes, but actual vanilla. Plus the chili aroma gives it a nice vegetal counter balance
T - one of the most pleasurable palate experiences I've had. Imagine ancho chili flakes in dark chocolate while sipping your favorite nutty espresso. And if that's not enough, add this rich vanilla note that smoothes out the entire experience. It sounds cloying and overwhelming, but it's not. That is the ultimate beauty of this beer.
M - maybe my least favorite part of this near perfect beer. If I were to nit pick, the weight if the beer in the mouth is not quite heavy enough to support its syrupy texture.
Overall, this is a game changing beer. For me. For you. For anyone. It is a sensorial experience. 848 charactersd_kizzle, Aug 14, 2014

T: Very similar to the smell that comes in waves. At first you get the chocolate/coffee, then the vanilla which gives way to the slightest burn from the peppers. The burn from the peppers is almost nonexistent but you do get the taste and flavor, which is done perfectly.
M: For a big beer, this has a great mouthfeel. Nice and creamy being thick where it needs to be

Poured into a bruery snifter. 
A- pours thick oil black with a finger and a half of dark brown head. No light whatsoever. The darkest beer I've ever seen.
S-vanilla, dark chocolate, sweet malts, roasted peppers, dark roasted coffee
T- this beer comes in layers. Front of the tongue you get the dark chocolate followed by bitter coffee and vanilla. As it hits the back of the throat, I get some roastyness from the chilles. 
M- very very thick and full bodied. Light carbonation
O- this is such a well balanced imperial stout, all of the spices shine through so well. This really is the Bomb! 678 charactersAdmbmb92, Aug 08, 2014

A-Nice dark color with a good tan head of foam but nothing exceptional.
S-Roasted malts as expected with slight chocolate and a bit of heat.
T-This is where this beer shines. Very good blend of chocolate roastiness of coffee with a bit of vanilla and chiles on the back end. The flavors really blend well together to make this beer a unique offering.
M- A bit disappointed here. I was expecting a good coating and silkiness but found the beer to be too thin for an imperial stout. When compared to the greats this beer falls short in this category.
O- This beer is all about a great blend of flavors with the heat of chiles on the backend. It definitely works and the chiles add just the right amount of heat without overpowering the beer. However, when compared to beers like KBS which I recently drank I find it falls short. Still a beer you want to be drinking. 936 charactersELS, Aug 04, 2014

4.54/5  rDev +1.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.512 oz. bottle poured into a Duvel Tulip style glass. Liquid portion comes out dark brown to black and it's thick and fudgy. There is a dark tan colored head with both big and small bubbles, decent lacing and glass retention the by both the head and the liquid itself. A lot of setament in the bottle plus a fair amount will work its way to the bottom of the glass as it sits. GIve it the ol' wine swirl and it'll blend all in. Deep red/brown highlights on the edges, but pretty much black for the most part. 
At first it seems like there's too much going on in the smell, but as it warms up a bit you can separate it out, and it's all pretty pleasant. Smells of dark over roasted stirred grain so it's darkly toasted around the edges. A little nutty, like earthy/bitter nuts like walnuts or pecans. Very dark roasted bold coffee, fudgey more sweet than bitter chocolate and a kick of chili peppers at the end that tickle your nose. 
Taste is for some reason a large step up from the smell; and I think it smells pretty good. Sweet roasted grain glazed with honey that's been stirred in the heat till it chars/sears the edges providing that extra flavor that you'd normally expect a crunch. Good sweetness, way more sweet than bitter chocolate, but the slightest bit, because it's dark chocolate. Bold, dark roasted coffee (I'd totally drink this coffee) flavors very prominent. I couldn't smell any vanilla but there's a slight hint of it after tasting the coffee. There's a finish of heat from some probably roasted chili peppers because there's a peppery sweetness and spice all at the same time. Pepper takes a backseat to pretty much all the other flavors, more of a complementing side kick. 
I gotta say, the mouthfeel of this beer is top notch. Nice and full bodied with lingering layer after layer of flavor. Good medium carbonation level that helps with the balance of the many flavors. Smooth most of the way through, sweet, fudgy, a little earthy with a spicy finish and lingering spice warmth at the end. Nice sipper of a beer. Really good beer, I don't know quite yet if it's worth all the hype, but I'm really glad I got a hold of a bottle. Thanks Matt for a nice trade. I'd drink Bomb! again for sure. 2,218 charactersAndyAvalanche, Aug 03, 2014

4.49/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from an unwaxed bottle into my plain snifter.
A- This dark concoction comes out nearly as thick as syrup into the glass. The color of the liquid is black as night with no light escaping it's grasp. A fairly sizable head for the style forms and retains pretty well, with an acceptable amount of lacing.
S- First scent that smack you in the nostrils right off the bat is slightly stale, yet potent coffee. Coffee flavor is dark and slightly bitter and dominates the front end of the scent. After the coffee fades away just a little, burnt dark malts come in and provide a little more darkness. Not a whole lot of vanilla in there, but it is slightly detectable under the dark malts with a little sweetness, but not as much as the cocoa nibs and peppers are. Chocolate and pepper flavors are subdued in comparison to the coffee that was right up front and bring the scent full circle by tying it all back to the coffee.
T- This beer starts off with a big bang of coffee up front, just like the smell. Coffee in the flavor is not quite as dark as in the scent, but a little more stale and bitter. Burnt malts kick in right away after the coffee, also like in the scent, but much stronger, enhancing the bitterness. The burnt malt is the primary flavor throughout the rest of the drink, but a hint of vanilla and pepper creep in towards the end. There is not- much chocolate flavor, if any, to be found in the taste of this beer, but the pepper does linger on the tongue just a little while after the drink.
M- Thick and dark and creamy, this fits perfectly into the feel for the style. One thing that really stands out in this beer's feel is the complete lack of alcohol burn or heat. It literally has zero, making it very dangerously drinkable for a 13% ABV beer.
Overall, this is a very good imperial stout. Aside from the small traces of peppery spice in the scent and taste, this reminds me a lot of KBS. 1,916 charactersboilermakerbrew, Jul 31, 2014

The taste however, is another story. It´s a big mix of coffee bean, vanilla and a charred ash kind of flavour that is right on the line of "do i like it/hate it....but in the end love it"
I didn´t notice any chilli or heat until it warmed up a little and even then it´s very mild.
Great beer, happy to have ticked it but it goes straight back on my wants list again now. 504 characterssunnrider, Jul 30, 2014

The body appears India ink black with a thin, wispy dark brown head; sediment left in the bottle. Deep and rich aroma of coffee grounds, charred grain, and chocolate. The taste exudes vanilla, cocoa, and sour cherries; boozy; cigarette ash. Heavy bodied; rich and smooth; velvety mouthfeel.
My goodness, what a heavenly, heavy brew! Big, bold, and rich throughout with incredibly robust and earthy dark tones in appearance, aroma, and flavor! Depth and complexity galore and a perfect find for RIS/double stout fans. Most definitely a dark ale flavored road-trip in a bottle!
And I love the catfish on the bottle cap (not that that has anything to do with the beer or its taste appeal -- it just looks cool)... 756 charactersbeergoot, Jul 27, 2014

This is really the only world class beer here in Oklahoma and I wanted to sit down with it again and really enjoy it. I get a 12 oz bottle here for $5.99.
A- basically what you would expect. Dark black beer with a beautiful dark brown head. I always love seeing that.
S- For me I smell loads of chocolate, traces of vanilla and dark roast coffee. Nice and malty
T- First sip tasted like room temperature hot chocolate. All the flavors are there. You can definitely pick out the vanilla and coffee. The peppers were the hardest flavor to pick out, but I started picking it up after a while with just a touch of heat on the finish. The 13% alcohol is masked extremely well
M- Huge body. Incredibly smooth, Just perfect.
O- So glad I sat down with this beer again. It is like dessert in a cup. It is completely satisfying and I can't wait to drink this during the winter. Everyone must try this. 964 charactersJustin8mypants, Jul 27, 2014

Liked the Bible Belt variation of this alot, happy to be able to review this now as well. ABV listed as 13% on the label.
Appearance - Oily black pour into a snifter. A finger or so of brown head forms, a swirly cap and thick ring are left by the end along with some good lace. Impressive for the ABV for sure.
Smell - Nice nose with prominent cocoa and chili spice, quite a bit of roasted malt as well, which rounds it all out very well. Coffee is on the lighter end of the spectrum but becomes more noticeable with warmth. Vanilla if you look for it. Noticeable alcohol but not bad. Pretttty nice.
Taste - More vanilla here, still very much cocoa/roast/chili forward. Coffee is pretty understated for me but can't really complain much. Smoke and heat from the chiles starts to build with further sips but it's not over the top and melds well. Touch of molasses.
Mouthfeel - Great mouthfeel, nice higher carbonation feels unique for a stout of this size, diggin' the liveliness on the palate. Very nice melding of flavors, a little booze noticeable but pretty damn drinkable. 12oz is no problemo solo.
Overall - As far as ridiculous-ingredient imperial stouts go, this may be as balanced, drinkable and enjoyable as it gets. 1,347 charactersChico1985, Jul 25, 2014

Nose is full of chocolate, not getting a ton of coffee. Just chocolate laced with chocolate and a hint of chili... Lots of ashy/campfire too
Tasting a bit heavy still on the ash tray/campfire but chili really comes through, cocoa nibs are bitter as expected 
Medium body. Possibly medium-full but rich and thick flavors 
Overall I am appreciating this much more than the first time I ever tried it (was nearly a drain pour)... Maybe my pallet has changed but this is a rich/chocolatey smooth imperial stout with some nice chili heat coming through to sooth the throat 669 charactersM_chav, Jul 24, 2014

A- Pours like used motor oil with a half in brown head.
S- Lots of coffee and roastiness with some chili spice and alcohol in the background.
T- Oh, how this beer changes as it warms! The chilies become much more pronounced towards the end. My first impression was of a very roasty dryness, but the taste quickly transformed, showing signs of dark chocolate and raisins. Almost no sweetness.
M- The feel is medium-full with medium amount of carbonation
O- Very nice beer. Would have again. 548 characterstviz33, Jul 21, 2014

Pours a nice dark beer. Forms a small dark brown foam. Smell is normal chocolate, coffee, nothing out of the ordinary for an imperial stout. Tastes like a good imperial stout, nice and smooth, not heady at all, lots of chocolate and coffee, not bitter. Then, you feel some heat in your throat, some tingling. The peppers hit you in the back of the throat but not in the mouth. Fantastic work. Body is syrupy. 477 charactersJulioH, Jul 20, 2014

1 finger of dark tan head. Leaves some splattered lace. Decent retention. Color is a deep black.
Flavor profile: A lot of rich chocolate and cocoa. Caramel and roasted malts. Coffee flavors. Vanilla. Molasses and dark fruit flavors. The chipotle peppers are near the end and in the finish. The chilies seem roasted as well.
Mouthfeel: Spicy, roasted, but smooth. Full bodied with a nice amount of carbonation. Ends dry with roasted notes.
Overall, this was a top level non BA stout. A massive amount of flavors. The only thing I would complain about is a bit too much roast, but otherwise I really like this one. 636 charactersmothman, Jul 18, 2014

Pours a very dark brown colour, mocha head; foamy, nice uneven sinking. Awesome lacing. Looks amazing. 
Smellls very bitter, loads of spicy espresso coffee on there. Roasty, slightly charred. Slight meaty hint. Smells pretty good. Bit bitter though and coffee-heavy. 
Taste is sweeter. Unsweetened chocolate all the way through with more cocoa rich flavour upfront, then notes of espresso, pepperberry and smokey lamb. I'm not kidding. Pretty impressive, but very strong and lots of very bitter notes. 
Full, pretty fluid. Touch of warming alcohol. Actually more of a shove in the throat rather than a touch. 
Impressive impy stout. Big, and really spicy. Pleasant sipper. 741 characterslaituegonflable, Jul 18, 2014

Nose is heavy coffee roast, pretty clean/not acrid, fair bit of vanilla and a light tinge of pepper. Full bodied, creamy and well carbonated. Taste has more pepper but still light (which I prefer). The roasted coffee is most prevalent and the vanilla comes in nicely behind but not sweet. Reasonably balanced, not sweet, pepper balances with vanilla. Not really chocolaty but a decent stout. 431 characterscpetrone84, Jul 15, 2014

4.71/5  rDev +5.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75This one looks to want to compete in the majors, and it starts off right. It's a thick, heavy and inky black brew with a medium-dark brown head that rises commandingly to two strong fingers of rocky cream. Retention is good, as it just sits there without losing any height for almost the entire session, and lacing clings plentifully to the glass in heavy patching most of the way down.
The aroma is big, if not huge, and it portends deliciousness to come. It's got all the roast expected from a big stout, the sweet vanilla and woody notes expected from barrel aging despite the fact that it isn't, including the alcoholic heat without the burn, there's a nice underlying smokiness, and there's some dark chocolate and unsweetened cocoa powder in the mix for a further contribution both sweet and dry.
Huge, rich, robust, and massively flavorful, this beer rises to the upper echelon thanks to not only its overall fantastic flavor, but its depth and complexity as well as its ability to be massively strong while avoiding the pitfalls of excess or overbearing. While a very nice note similar to bourbon whisky comes through, it doesn't overtake the subtler (ironic, yes) aspects of the beer. The vanilla sweetness is ever-present with the roastiness, and a creamy blend of dark chocolate and milk chocolate glides over the tongue. More than most beers, even many barrel-aged stouts, there's a big, dry woody note that lends itself as much to the flavor as anything and becomes its strongest note without drowning out anything else. It works with just a hint of char, no acridity showing because of the sweetness countering and its easy smoothness as it works in the brew. The only thing that might throw one off is that, without knowing beforehand, I wouldn't immediately be able to say this was brewed with peppers but for an extremely subtle heat that doesn't build up.
The mouthfeel has all the trademarks of the style and its uniquely American nature: huge, rich robustness in a thick, extremely full body that isn't thinned by the alcohol and is velvety smooth on the tongue, rolling off just the right amount of carbonation and extremely creamy. The fluffiness building from the carbonation does give it a lighter feel in the middle into the smooth finish, but never much less than full. 2,295 charactersBrenden, Jul 14, 2014

Smell - The aroma smells like dessert. I noted chocolate and vanilla coming together, but peppers were hiding in the background.
Taste - The sweetness of the malts melt together with the chocolate. The chocolate is balanced by the vanilla to create a cake like quality. But before you get the impression that this is too sweet, the peppers create a burn on the back of the tongue. The spice does not overwhelm, but adds nuance to the chocolate goodness. As a reference point, this is slightly less enjoyable than Mexican Cake.
Mouthfeel - The peppers are allowed to linger because of the thickness of the stout. I wish it was a little thicker so I could enjoy it a little more.
Overall - I like this one a lot. Whereas straight coffee Russian Imperial Stout were once the standard, this is the new trend. It is an improvement. 969 charactersJohnnyHopps, Jul 13, 2014

Got to try a 8-oz pour on tap, next to Abraxas, in March 2014 (gave a 4.5. 4.25 for Abraxas)
This review's based on a 7-12-14 tasting of a May 2014 unwaxed bottle. Comparing it to a 2014 Huna consumed last weekend, despite the fact the adjuncts are slightly different.
A: like Huna, very dark appearance, with zero light escaping from the body. there is a red tinge at the edges. there's no head though, and weaker alcohol legs.
S: vanilla and very, very earthy coffee grinds. the ancho chile gets drawn out with a vigorous swirl - very interesting. I wish the cacao was more pronounced though
T: like Huna, the chile comes across most distinctly, without "heat." the flavor's earthier than Huna, likely because of the addition of ancho AND coffee to the vessel. personally, though, I'd prefer more cacao, less coffee
M: thinner mouthfeel than Huna, despite the 13%. to its credit, this went down easier than expected for the ABV

5/5  rDev +11.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This is a 5 star beer. To rate it lower is to wantonly find lacking what is in every way an superlative creation and satisfying beer; or you don't enjoy the style.
The beer is near black and thick looking; it has a medium to thick brown head with lacing.
Its smell is perhaps its weakest point, as it is less distinguished than its other attributes. A strong smell of coffee and roasted malt.
The combination of cacoa, peppers and coffee combine smoothly to create a delicious taste. It is mildly sweet and very strong. The high alcohol content seems to support a depth and variation in taste as you sip. 
This beer is heavy full bodied, smooth in the mouth and extremely balanced for an ABV above the roof and a complex list of ingredients. This is one beer I buy every time I see it. 789 charactersLessMyth, Jul 12, 2014

S - Wow, lots going on here. Chocolate, coffee, a hint of pepper. Sounds weird but I even detect something that smells like a chocolate milk shake
T - Awesome flavor. Not as sweet tasting as the aroma would indicate. Lots of sweet chocolate dominate at first but then it fades to a oak type bitterness. Tastes of coffee are nicely mixed in the middle. It even has a little bourbon flavor on the finish. 
M - Great heavy beer. It does has a pretty powerful burn but what else would you expect at 13% abv. Really easy to drink and provides a nice warming feeling as it goes down!
O - Fantastic beer. Glad I stumbled across one. Has a powerful but well balanced flavor. I was a little leery when it mentioned chili peppers, but they are very mild and hard to detect but are present. Will be picking another one up soon! 965 charactersGoosehunter75, Jul 10, 2014

A- jet black with a thin tan head
S- mostly coffee with a hint of the chili pepper
T- Hits you up front with the coffee. This is mostly a coffee stout and a chili stout second. Then as expected you get just a slight hint of chili spice hitting your tongue. The taste is not overly complex and I think it hurts the beer. More chocolate would've helped balance it out better.
M- Not too thick and a good amount of carbonation
O- I was pleased that the spiciness was not overwhelming, and actually almost underwhelming. But I think it was spot on for my tastes. The coffee flavor was superb, but what held it back from being a world class 4.5+ beer was there wasn't much of a third flavor blended in. But overall a great beer and you should try it if you haven't. 806 characterslinnymtu, Jul 07, 2014

Pitch black, tan head swirls nicely. Full on assault of thick dark choc, roast, coffee, with the merest hint of chilli in background. But a nice addition. Big and thick in mouth. Demands respect given ABV warmth. Chewy mouthfeel. Like really chewy like soup.
Chilli lingers a lot longer than other palates elements, and the initial hit is all flavour, leaving a mid hollow palate and chilli afterwards, thus a bit unbalanced overall. 446 charactersheygeebee, Jul 06, 2014

Pours a lovely looking black with nice tanned head and lacing.
Smell is a lot of coffee and a slightly dusty chilli. Definitely get some chocolate also. Interesting melding of coffee, chilli and chocolate; which I guess is really interchangeable with vanilla. As time goes on I even get sweet malt and vanilla.
Taste is coffee, definitely has a potent earthiness to it which could also encompass chocolate really, and it finishes with a tasty drying cocoa powder presence. Taste has a delightful mounting chilli presence, which nevertheless retains its subtlety. It's more of a little extra kick at the end than anything else.
I think chocolate (cocoa powder) becomes more pronounced in nose and taste as time goes on- it's really quite rich and strong in this one.
I had this on tap last night and out of the bottle really blows it out of the water (to abuse a beer review cliché).
What to review this in the same sphere as? Is it a coffee beer, like the classics Speedway or Peche Mortel? Is it a chocolate/coffee beer like Breakfast Stout? Or is it a more Mexican chocolate inspired beast like the deviant Hunaphu's (notably absent of coffee)? I will say that the chilli in this beer is a little stronger than I've noticed in Hunaphu's (much to this beer's credit), but this beer may also be fresher than the times I've had Huna.
Just excellently tasty stuff and it's great to have the opportunity to buy this in Sydney. Thanks to Prairie. 1,466 charactersdanieelol, Jul 05, 2014

Appearance - One of the darkest beers I've had. Completely opaque. Fantastic legs and head. Head is dark... the color of caramelized sugar.
Smell - Scent is subtle. Nice, but not overpowering. 
Taste - Robust. Coffee prevalent, chocolate close behind. Chili isn't overpowering--it is pleasant. Vanilla mildly brings up the rear.
Mouthfeel - Balanced. Isn't thick and coating, but is not thin either. 
Overall - Quite nice! On average I'd still prefer a nice bourbon barrel stout, but this definitely deserves the hype. 616 charactersajmmin, Jul 05, 2014

Pours a very silky and slick black-brown colour, with a fineness to the body that almost makes it looks thin. Head is minimal, forming some dark frothy and settling out to a topological film. Minimal lacing. Body is good however, and there's fine carbonation present when tilted. Looks pretty good all up.
Nose is ripe and biting with bright coffee characters first up. There's a slight smoky vegetative quality to it as well, possibly the ancho. There's plenty of roast as well: surprisingly, there's not a great deal of sweetness though, and it relies much on the coffee for its breadth.
Taste is extremely smooth and fine, with a clean, slick malt roast character glossed over by some malt sweetness—again it's fairly subdued, and it's an interesting way to go. Some coffee characters bite a little around the back as well, laced with some aromatic chilli characters, although no heat. Alcohol is very well hidden. I drank this with breakfast before any other beers, so I wasn't inured to booze by any means—but I still couldn't really sense it.
Overall, yeah, this is another cracking brew from Prairie. I'm yet to have a bad beer from them, and this is probably even pushing up their average despite the average being very high already. 1,323 characterslacqueredmouse, Jul 05, 2014

4.34/5  rDev -3.1%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25Excellent beer, had within a day of Bible Belt. Poured thick, dark walnut color with a thin coating of chestnut head. Smelled of fresh roasted coffee beans and cocoa, with a tinge of spiciness. Tasted heavily of coffee and baker's chocolate; much more bitter than sweet. Hints of chile, but very subdued- almost more like a fresh vegetable rather than heat. Mouthfeel was thick and creamy with lots of texture. Finished leaving heavy bitterness and the slightest burn.
Overall, awesome stout. Didn't really get much vanilla or sweetness, but the coffee and chiles worked well together and the think mouthfeel gave it a milkshake character. Drinks like a beer with a much lower abv than 14%, which I'm always a fan of. 718 charactersshangwang, Jul 04, 2014

S: 4.25 Lots of chocolate and vanilla at first. Some dark malt and coffee follow with roasted nuttiness. No chile on the nose. 
T: 4.25 Vanilla still dominates. Coffee comes through more than on the nose. The roasted malt/coffee bitterness is well integrated with the chocolate and vanilla. The slight heat at the end rounds everything out. 
M: 4.25 A little thinner than I would like, but the carbonation level is nice.
O: 4.25 Probably a bit more going on than Bible Belt, but I think I prefer that over Bomb. It seemed a little richer and the chile was a bit stronger. It also seemed like Bible Belt had a more dry chile flavor while bomb comes off as more of a fresh chile. This is really nice, but for me it comes in at a close second. 788 charactersTele, Jul 03, 2014

The flavor was equally great, with a lot of coffee and light chocolate up front, followed by the subtle cinnamon taste and then the chilis jump out at ya. The mouthfeel was smooth and viscous- coating the mouth and tongue nicely. Surprisingly I never got any burn from the alcohol. This was the second time trying this one, the first time was rather underwhelming, but this one is absolutely fantastic! 635 characterstimontheroad, Jul 03, 2014

Smell - here is the strong part with rich chocolate and malts up front. a well balanced spice hits your nose followed by some smokiness
Taste - roasty malts right away followed by dark chocolate and then a sweetness. smooth chili finish to the beer as well
Mouthfeel - nicely carbonated, but I wish it was a little smoother.

S: Oh man... chocolate, oats, rye bread, and some spice. 
T: Yes! Chocolate, oatmeal which brings a nice creaminess, rye bread, grain, raisins and other dark fruits, the ancho chili is definitely noticeable but not overpowering at all. Nice balance of flavors. 
M: The mouth plays around nicely with the taste, in that it's thick and creamy like butter, yet has a hard, concrete punch to it. 
O: Awesome beer. Taste is very balanced and complex. I get a lot of flavors out of it. This is amazing for an already amazing style. 623 characterstitty_mcbitty, Jul 01, 2014

Almost all of the adjuncts used can be picked up in the nose; milk chocolate, a caramel/vanilla sweetness, and a touch of spice. Taste is much the same but a roasty bitter black coffee note comes through too. Mouthfeel is a bit thin for a 14% stout. All in all, one of my favourite non-barrel-aged adjunct-laden stouts. 356 charactersBeervana, Jul 01, 2014

A - Blacker than your morning joe. Deep, deep dark brown with a nice, medium head that leaves virtually no lace. Head fades fast.
S - The coffee and alcohol hit you right as you open the bottle. Chocolate is definitely there and easy to smell, but comparatively much harder to pick up. Something slightly funky is there, but I think it's just the combination of the chili and the vanilla. If you inhale deep you get the burn of the chili.
T - BOOM. The first sip is unexpected. It punches you. Smooth, lush, and that lingering note of iced mocha and alcohol. The balance on this beer is great, especially when you consider it's 13% ABV. It tastes just like you'd expect a dark, chocolatey beer to taste. The malt...it makes me so happy. 
M - Another reviewer correctly pointed out that the chili comes out more strongly if you swish this around a bit before swallowing. This beer really has the mouth feel of a nice cup of dark roast, heavy but not cloying. 
O - Prairie Artisan Ales has a very solid coffee stout here. The addition of the chocolate, vanilla, and chili somehow all works out very well. 
Note - Don't drink this beer too cold; you'll miss all the fun.

The smell is intense! Chocolate, fresh iced coffee, vanilla... yum.
The slightly warmed taste starts with spicy chocolate with chili peppers (which wasn't in the smell). Coffee and sweet malt follow. Vanilla, booze and chili finish it. Thick and delicious.

A: Jet black with a finger of dark, milk-chocolate head that leaves nice legs around the tip of the glass.
S: Tons of coffee, some dark chocolate, and spicy pepper that tingles the nose.
T: A roasted espresso bomb, some dark bakers chocolate, roasty malts. The peppers are sort of hidden, but show up and linger in the finish if you hold it in your mouth for a bit before swallowing... definitely interesting.
M: Smooth and medium bodied. Not sticky or chewy in anyway.
O: Kinda hoped for more spice, but overall, this is a super solid example of a coffee stout, and I love the small bottling format. A bomber would be too much. 678 charactersHalfbrother83, Jun 29, 2014

From a bottle into a snifter
Gold wax
Coffee, cacao, vanilla beans and chili peppers. 
Nordaggios coffee
APPEARANCE: Muddy black pour yields a three finger, foamy, medium tan head with very good retention. Jet black body with slightly higher levels of carbonation. Slowly fades to a full foam cap, then a wisp and ring. A simple ring remains but leaves no lacing down the glass. 
SMELL: All the adjuncts are there. Chilies are first, with coffee, vanilla and cacao nibs, showing up in that order. Light roast, sweet cream and milk chocolate notes. Everything is really balanced in the nose. Can't get much better than this really. Bold and wonderful. 
TASTE: Really flavorful with vanilla, chocolate and light roasted notes up front. Creamy chocolate and coffee through the middle into a big and lingering finish of bitter chocolate and coffee, sweet milk chocolate, vanilla, sweet cream and some spicy chilies. Chilies are well measured and give a little bite and heat in the aftertaste, but aren't overpowering. Lots of adjuncts but they're all well there and well balanced. Perhaps a touch too much heat lingers, but just great. 
PALATE: Medium body and slightly higher carbonation. Creamy smooth on the palate, goes down smooth with a chili scratch at the swallow, finishing slightly mouth-coating. A chili bite and some heat lingers, but still really good. 
OVERALL: This is excellent. Could be a touch thicker and a have a touch less carbonation for top marks, I'm really getting nit picky here. Fantastic, and there's no way this is actually 14% ABV either. Easily equal to Mexican Cake, and a tick below Huna. World class in any respect. Thanks again Doodler. Highly recommended. 1,751 charactersJeffo, Jun 27, 2014

4.47/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured into an Ikea snifter. The liquid is oil-black, and viscous. It's kind of shocking to see that the bottle is actually brown when there's no more beer in it. The pour kicks up a decent-sized head that's dark mahogany, and almost even purple. The pour also attaches lots of coke-like bubbles to the side of the glass, so it's actually hard to see the liquid for the first minute or so. After a few minutes, most of the bubbles have died down, and what's left is a foreboding black liquid with a ring of bubbles around the glass and a tiny film on top. It would be nice with better retention, but at 13% ABV, I can hardly complain.
Aroma is great! Coffee is the first thing I get, followed by dark chocolate and a sneaky capsaicin-spiciness. Hints of dark fruit, plums, cinnamon. Really nice aroma - smells like wonderful spicy coffee.
Flavor follows the nose - chocolate, smoky ancho peppers, coffee, cinnamon. The coffee isn't super roasty - more of a dark fruitiness. The fruitiness seems to give it a kind of lactic tartness, making it taste super creamy. The capsaicin is perfectly integrated - not overpowering, but nicely noticeable, and adding a nice smokiness to the overall flavor profile. Finish is slightly dry with some lingering heat on the palate. Aftertaste is creamy chocolate and peppers. No hop character to speak of. Great dessert beer. Amazingly drinkable for such a high ABV.
Mouthfeel is really well done - thick, chewy, creamy body with minimal carbonation. The capsaicin cuts through it well, making it seem like there's more carbonation than there is, giving it a nice edge.
Overall, very well-made stout. It's complex, balanced, and delicious. If anything, I wish it had a bit more coffee character, but it's great as it is. 1,758 charactersMasterfulIdiot, Jun 25, 2014

I also got a bottle of Bible Belt in the same trade, I drank the BB first. I found the BB to be much spicier than this beer, which was liquid perfection to me. It pours black as night with a nice head that doesn't stick around too long. Smells of vanilla, cocoa and oatmeal with very light chile. The taste follows the same, the chile hits a little at the end, but it is much subtler here than in the Bible Belt. I loved this beer and I can't wait to get more. The spice of the chiles is in perfect balance with every other flavor of the beer. 594 characterstmbgnicu, Jun 22, 2014

A: poured black with very small brown head which quickly dissipated into a halo
S: chocolate. The cocoa and vanilla I think give it a milk chocolate aroma. A little tobacco or smokey smell as well
T: big cocoa taste. Def let the beer warm up. Once the beer is warm you will really taste the complex and balanced flavors. Starts with cocoa, smokey tobacco, midway ender is the chili peppers. Great balance of flavors
M: lighter than I expected. A little carbonated but has some bite with the peppers. Great pepper feel on the end
Overall: great brew. Used the ingredients spectacularly. Try it. Peppers are not overwhelming. 655 characterstrippytbta, Jun 19, 2014

Strings of carbonation bubbling throughout the body. Aromas of rich roasted coffee, butter cocoa nibs, subtle pepper spice, smoke and tobacco highlights, woody highlights, and hints of molasses. The smoke and tobacco build the more you dig in. Flavors are coffee and chocolate forward, like a mocha fist to your taste buds. Wow...perfectly balanced and flavorful. The pepper notes are very subtle, but you begin to notice a building warmth in the backbone of this brew. Woody and vanilla notes flit in and out to accent, but never draw attention away from the beer as a whole. The body is smooth and big, yet light, as well, thanks to the carbonation. A coffee heavy aftertaste, with an overall roasted feel. The finish is slick, smooth, and light, with a subtle warmth and bitter linger. This is a great beer. Big characteristics all around, but amazingly drinkable! 1,017 charactersGarthDanielson, Jun 16, 2014

Thanks to Narthax for sending this one over in a trade!
A: Pours an opaque jet black with 1 fingers width of dense, dark mocha colored head. Head dissipates down at a moderate rate. 
S: Big coffee upfront paired with an equally big peppery heat are the first aromas I get. This is followed by roasted malt, subtle vanilla, and a burnt plastic-like aroma. I dont get much cocoa/chocolate at all, and probably wouldnt have even noticed it if it wasnt listed on the bottle. 
T: Roasted malt, chocolate, and coffee are the first flavors I get. Cocoa is more prevalent in the taste than in the aroma. Chili peppers are noticeable but pretty subtle. Not nearly as much heat as a few other pepper stouts Ive had. Good but pretty one dimensional is that its so roasted flavors forward, and IMO it would benefit from a bigger pepper kick. 
M/D: Full body but not thick, pretty smooth, drinkability is good, ABV is very well masked. 
O: Very good, but I expected more. There are other chili stouts I prefer to this one like Huna, Mexican Cake and Lucador to name a few. Certainly worth a try though. 1,140 characterszac16125, Jun 16, 2014

The smell dominated by spent coffee grounds with dark chocolate and a hint of chili pepper heat. 
The taste is of bitter black coffee, faint dark chocolate and spicy chili pepper accents. 
The texture is heavy bodied with medium carbonation. 
Coffee dominates the aroma and flavor yet, the other ingredients blend into the mixture nicely. The 13% ABV is nearly undetectable. Personally, I am getting no vanilla in the smell or taste. No matter, this is an impressive imperial stout. 605 charactersFurlinator, Jun 15, 2014
4.42/5  rDev -1.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Serving Type: 12 ounce bottle poured into a snifter. Love the cap, my all time favorite now, a catfish.
Appearance: I think this is the best part of the beer, it has a world class appearance, pitch black, no light, nice creamy tan head, a lot of lacing that I have never seen in an imperial stouts. 
Smell: Big coffee, a little roasted pepper smell on the end, a little bit of chocolate, but the coffee is the most prevalent aroma. 
Taste: Coffee, a little roasted pepper, not getting any chocolate on the taste, some bitterness at the back end, a lot of heat like taking a shot. I think its a combination of the alcohol 13% and the roasted peppers, getting a big dry bitter coffee flavor, it's almost as if I am eating coffee grounds, really close with the dry finish. 
Mouthfeel: Really creamy, dry mouthfeel that lingers.
Overall: After tasting several different stouts with coffee, I'd decided to edit my review and change my rating, as this is a tasty beer, even though it did not leave the best impression when I first drank it. I've had several bottles since and it's very tasty. 1,091 charactersBrolo75, Jun 15, 2014

This is a good beer. 2 fingers of dark kaki head, black as night. Smell is predominantly coffee and cocoa nibs with a subtle spice diced peppers smell. Taste gets a bit more complex with amplified notes of what you smell… No vanilla at all for me, kinda disappointing there. Feels great on the tongue like any good RIS. As I said at the beginning this is a good beer… this is not a great beer. Abraxas is a vastly superior mexican style imperial stout. Maybe this just needs age… will re review in a year or so. 560 charactersjdprmd, Jun 14, 2014

 is prominent on the tail end, but it is a welcome break from the intense bitter and earthy flavors of the cocoa nibs and coffee. This beer is incredibly well balanced. It drinks remarkably well for that high of an abv. Cheers on this right here! 492 charactersCrusinforaBrewsin, Jun 14, 2014

4.41/5  rDev -1.6%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.25Bought a single 12 oz bottle from Gabriels Beer Warehouse in San Antonio while on travel.
Appearance is that of your typical top flight stout. Smell is heavy on the coffee and a little chocolate. Taste is very solid, but like the smell it was just a little too heavy on the coffee and hop finish. I really liked the subtle hint of chile but its very slight so its added very well. Biggest highlight to me is how this 13% beer is so light and not boozy at all. Feels like an 8% Stout. Overall I highly recommend a sampling but I can't quite put it into that top tier with a small handful of others that I liked better. 617 charactersbubseymour, Jun 14, 2014

Looks like its sprinkling on top of the beer.  Smell is of rich dark chocolate and dark coffee. Smells like a big stout. Raisins and molasses come through as well. Taste is out of this world. Dark chocolate and burnt coffee throughout with the slightest touch of heat at the finish. Mouthfeel is about perfect for me too. Coats the mouth well, tingles the palate and the heat at the end ties everything together. Overall one of my favorite new beers. Gotta have this if you love stouts. 578 characterstoppoop, Jun 13, 2014

Beautiful in the snifter with a dark khaki-colored head that quickly settles over the pitch black body. 
Fresh dark roast coffee and some sweet malt are prominent on the nose. Not detecting much but I just drove 4 hours from Albuquerque. 
Still lots of dark roast coffee on the tongue, but also a slight bite of chile, some vanilla, dark chocolate, and a finish that consists of bitter hops, dark chocolate and the pique from the chile lingering for a long dry finish. 
The alcohol is all but buried, the beer is viscous, creamy, hopped up and spicy. Certainly a lot going on. Great, interesting and unique beer. Those are my types. 703 charactersONovoMexicano, Jun 11, 2014

I am always suspicious of these high priced beers from new breweries even if people are hyping them to hell and back. Suspicions confirmed. This was a good beer it was just grossly overpriced, $5 would be much more appropriate. Dark solid black, coffee colored head, looks pretty rich. Aroma was a touch of chocolate and thick imperial stout. Flavor had notes of chocolate but I didn't really pick up much coffee or peppers. This was good but I think Bible Belt was better and it certainly wasn;t worth the price tag. 597 charactersArrogantB, Jun 09, 2014

Smells of vanilla, coconut, chocolate powder, and roasted malt. Inviting aroma to say the least. It's readily apparent in the nose that this is a great beer.
In the taste, hazlenut, cocoa, coffee, vanilla, mild spice, wood, char, toast, molasses, and a fair hop bitterness. A little alcohol comes through. Full bodied, smooth drinkable brew.

Had heard good things, but wasn't prepared. This beer beats the hype. 
Poured into my Evo snifter. Came out a full black pour with a generous creamy head. 13%? No way would I think if would be such a full whipped cream like top. Dissipated fairly fast, but left some solid creamy edges and lace as the glass emptied. Looked all of a very well made beer.
Nose was very good. Rich roasted coffee, some chocolate, some vegetable like notes. Hinted something rich and complex. But the taste? No hinting here...Taste was just jaw dropping! OMG... Bomb is the perfect name. .a chocolate bomb...waves of vanilla...bright hits of peppers ( best pepper inclusion I've had since Hunahpu)...then chocolate again. May be best chocolate beer I've ever tasted. Then it got decadent. Pure silk mouth feel. The malts were so full and balanced. You know the alcohol is big....but like an XO. So smooth...no burn. An amazing sipper.
Unsure, but understand "gold" wax is older batch. Can't compare, but this beer probably went from great to outstanding from some aging. If I get another bottle...it's going right to the cellar.
And I just love it's a 12oz'er 1,204 charactersBillRoth, Jun 07, 2014

A- Dark, almost coffee brown. No speakable head, but thin layer of redish-brown bubbles.
S- Smell is complex. I get dark coco and peppers, but the coffee smells almost freeze-dried... not super appealing.
T- Again as complex as the smell. Waves of sweet and heat. Dark coco and light coffee, followed by pepper, washed away be coco and vinilla. Very well balanced. For being such a high ABV, I expected to taste the alcohol, but it is nicely hidden. 
M- Smooth, but chalky at the same time. The chalky is like the mouthfeel of eating dark chocolate bars... not a bad feel, but intersting in beer.
O- I wanted to like this more with all the hype, but I wan't blown away. It's very, very good, but not as perfect as I thought it would be. Maybe the flavors have to meld for a while longer... glad I have two more bottles. 871 charactersPBRmeasap1980, Jun 07, 2014

A: A big three finger head that almost got away from me while pouring the beer into a teku glass. The foam is a dark caramel color, similar to cola, with pillowy small bubbles. Endless retention that never seems to fall, when it does it leaves a dark soapy looking lacing with random placing on the edge. The beer is pitch black, no light peeks through in the brightest areas.
S: Big chocolate nose. Milk chocolate, bakers chocolate, dark cocoa with caramel and coffee. Vanilla is equally balanced in the nose as it warms up, no artificial flavor hear folks. Sweet aroma overall with a nice welcoming chocolate impression. No alcohol or off aromas to speak off.
T: Chocolate from front to back. Big dark chocolate flavor mixed with silky milk chocolate and a moderate neutral bitterness in the beginning. It reminds me of drinking chocolate milk. As the flavors continute the vanilla and caramel flavors kick in mellowing out the roastyness that starts creeping in. The sweetness is dialed in perfectly for my taste. Not overwhelming, but just enough to make it desert like with all the chocolate and vanilla flavors going on. There is a subtle earthy hop flavor in the finish that makes it kind of refreshing (for a 14%??).
M: The peppers come through as more of a tingling mouthfeel then a flavor, however its mild and a nice compliment. The carbonation is mild and makes the beer feel silky smooth. The body is thick and full with some creamyness for days.
O: Wow.. Lived up to it's name. And I wish more beers with this high of gravity would come in this format instead of bombers. A dangerously drinkable, chocolate filled, vanilla soaked, imperial stout that goes down like silk. If you don't like this beer you probably don't like the style.. 1,765 charactersguityler83, Jun 04, 2014

4.06/5  rDev -9.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4Lots of coffee, which is great, but the coffee itself is not great. Bitterness in the range of an espresso shot of burned coffee beans. Coffee is nothing near was BCBCS has. 
Peppers are very present. Gives the beer an interesting finish and warmth. Not super pleasant, not unpleasant, just very unique. Not usually a huge fan of beers with chile peppers, but this is very well balanced. 
Glad I got to try a bottle of this. I would buy again, but probably not seek out again. 479 charactersgarrettboatman, Jun 03, 2014
4.05/5  rDev -9.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4Poured into stone snifter.
Pours black, big charred brown head that settles a good ring. Lacing is minimal. 
Flavors of coffee, bitter chocolate, vanilla, the charred exterior of a toasted marshmallow, roasted peanut, and subtle spice in the form of cinnamon and old cayenne. 
Mouthfeel is medium with carbonation like that of a porter. A little slick yet a bit watery. 
Overall the beer displays solid flavors and appearance but falls short in the mouthfeel and smell department. It's not a Huna or Abraxas. 512 charactersMarcWP, Jun 03, 2014

T-This is certainly a bold beer, a taste I will not soon forget.
M-Full bodied, became more drinkable with every sip I took.

A - Pours bitch black and settles quickly with little head retention to a light khaki ring around the glass. The lacing is slippery and it displays a decent amount of carbonation around the outside of the glass. I can't wait to dive in!
S - The aroma is of dark roasted coffee and spices. There is no mistaking that there are chilies in this beer. Almost remind me of Abraxas (I hope I win the lottery for Ba Abraxas...lol). You can also detect subtle hints of cinnamon and nutmeg. There is maybe the tiniest bit of vanilla, but nothing overwhelming. Enough is enough...let's drink it!
T - The first flavor that hits my palate is coffee. It almost is reminiscent of BCBCS, but then the spiciness of the chillies kick in. Like the nose, there is a faint amount of vanilla and a hint of cinnamon that make themselves know on the back end. The spice of this beer covers them up. There is a touch of dark chocolate, but there is mostly coffee in this one. Trust me, there is nothing disappointing here. 
M - Perfect balance of carbonation bite, spiciness, and depth of flavors. Medium to full bodied, mouth coating with a long finish. 
O - This is one beer that is hard to criticize. What else is there to say about this that hasn't been said already. I am glad that I have another in the cellar. This one seems like it can go another 6mo.- 1yr, but it probably won't make it that long. I would be more inclined to drink this fresh as to get all it has to offer before it fades away. Buy/trade for one if you haven't had it! I promise you won't be disappointed. 1,605 charactersCubatobaco, Jun 01, 2014

Poured a rich dark brown, with light brown head that disappears quickly.
Smells of coffee, dark chocolate, with a hint of spice.
The first tastes of chocolate with a coffee bite. Notes of sweet and vanilla follow.
Rolls across the tongue, leaving a slight coating. The pepper leaves a pleasant heat on the sides of the pallet. 
A very enjoyable beer. 397 charactersAbe_Froman, May 26, 2014

5/5  rDev +11.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I was very lucky to get not just one bottle of the Bomb but two yesterday afternoon. After letting it cool down for a full day and also chilling a tulip glass in the freezer, I decided to open it up. After pouring the Bomb into the glass I could instantly smell the rich notes of the stout itself. Gorgeous, dark brown head. The first taste was absolutely incredible. The vanilla beans really came out, but only for a short second followed by the chili pepper. The instant decline of the chili pepper rounded everything out perfectly, making me want that second taste immediately. I can tell certain little other notes and the full taste if I actually burp a little after I've drank it for a while(sound nasty but you get a whole new taste). The chili pepper really came out heavy, but amazing at the same time. 
I've had literally hundreds of stouts from around the world and this one is hands down top on my list. The appearance is beautiful, the smell is rich, the taste is out of this world and the mouthfeel really sets a high standard for any other stout I might want to try out in the future. 1,100 charactersLance87, May 26, 2014

4.61/5  rDev +2.9%look: 4.25 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a pitch black color with a mocha brown head, and barely any head ever accumulates. Smell is muted at first, but as it warms up milk chocolate bursts onto the noise with some coffee as well. First sip is creamy and smooth with vanilla and sweet chocolate melting on the tongue. Then as the sip settles a strong coffee bitterness pops and brings the roasty malts along with a tiny bit of that pepper. Also, at 13% there is hardly any alcohol presence to speak of, to the point where I almost forgot to even mention it here. Mouthfeel is creamy and sticky as it warms up. Full body and mildly carbonated. Overall, this is an incredible beer and I highly recommend seeking it out. Im not usually the biggest fan of coffee forward stouts, but the smooth vanilla/milk chocolate superbly balances the coffee bitterness and roasted malts.And for reference this was fresh, so It'd be interesting to see how this ages. 914 charactersCTbrew32, May 25, 2014

4.91/5  rDev +9.6%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Appearance: Beaitiful rich brown head that stretches over two fin guts pouring down the middle. Jet black with decent carbonation that leaves a very thi. Tipping over the beer as it sits next to me. 
Smell: Roasted malts and coffee hit first. milk chocolate like quality to it as well, sensing it's richness of the smell. But after that you get a dry finish that starts to show you there are indeed peppers in this beer. 
Taste: light coffee and cocoa lead. You get a sense of the vanilla afterwards but it's a nuance and I might not know it was there if I hadn't read it on the label. Certainly a secondary ingrediant. Finishes dry and balanced.
Mouthfeel: Not sure if it's that the beer is perfectly carbonated or if the mouthfeel is a tad light for the style. Either way I think it works very well. Carbonation moves the beer around well. Pepper leaves a drying quality that gets you ready for another sip 
Overall: Might be the best non barrel aged beer I've reviewed. Bible Belt will be reviewed soon. BOMB! is awesome an I'm glad I have friends in Oklahoma. Well done to Prairie Artisan Ales. 1,102 charactersbeardown2489, May 25, 2014

Poured into snifter
A - Black. 1 finger tan mocha head.
S - Coffee, vanilla beans, milk and dark chocolate, hint of spicy heat from the peppers. Roasted malts.
T - Chocolate, coffee, slight heat from the peppers, slight vanilla bean. Roasted malts meld with all of the added flavors.
MF - Slight prickly sensation from the peppers, but nothing intense. Full bodied but not the fullest. 
O - This beer reminds me of Hunahpu's but without the cinnamon. All of the flavors are melded together very well without one dominating the profile.

S- Dark chocolate, vanilla, hints of red peppers, roasty malts, roasted coffee.
T- Big, bold flavors of dark chocolate, bitter coffee, vanilla, hints of peppers, huge roastiness. Great combination of flavors with no huge sweetness, but huge complexity. The hints of peppers add another level of flavor, but it does not overpower like some beers with peppers.
M- The mouthfeel is the highlight of this beer. Frothy, creamy, extremely drinkable for a 14% monster. Maybe the slightest sign of alcohol, but the peppers somewhat mask even the littlest alcohol presence. Insanely good mouthfeel.
O- A great beer for sure. Complex, great feel, great flavors. Perhaps the best non barrel-aged imperial stout I have had. 832 charactersstephenjmoore, May 14, 2014

O - quite exceptional and will lead me to seek out other Prairie Beers. 413 charactershops202, May 08, 2014

Smell: vanilla, milk chocolate, light earthy and caramel espresso. A little chili. Taste: milk chocolate, caramel, sugary plum, vanilla, espresso note - earthy, building chili heat (and then after a while it's no longer noticeable). Medium bodied with light carbonation and very creamy. Easy drinking for the abv. This really showcases the aging adjuncts... I'd question whether the base beer has anything going on, but there's no point in that as the result is very tasty. 586 charactersbabaracas, May 04, 2014

Jet black color with a substantial amount of floaties on the bottom on the initial pour but dissipated as this beer was drank. Above average active carbonation for the style. 
Smell: Airy oak, heavily roasted medium bodied coffee grounds, and sweet milk chocolate and lactose hit on the nose. Definite splash of earthy fruits from the peppers. Hoppy tones mute some of the vanilla. Smokiness lingers from the nose to the body. Chocolate and lactose continue to be very present throughout. 
Taste: Smooth front of vanilla, espresso, and milk chocolate greet the drinker. Herbal, rustic fruits make a bold entrance on the body. Light coffee grounds, creamy lactose, and lingering herbal notes round out the body. The finish is a dry smokiness with a mixture of the earlier mentioned flavors with no outstanding outliers. 
Mouthfeel: The palate is lightly taxed for what this beer is. Carbonation fits this brew very well. Slight oaky chalkiness lingers. 
Overall: Loved by first offering from Prairie. The additives are well done in this brew but for me almost come together too well and none really stand out. The peppers are the highlight here. Just a tick off of being a world class stout but something I would always be excited to drink. 1,301 charactersKFBR392, Apr 29, 2014

A- Pours a dark black with a half finger of dense dark mocha head that has great retention receding to a flat top leaving some spotty mocha lacing.
S- Espresso, cocoa nibs, hint of vanilla and chili peppers, subtle yeast in the background. Very pleasant aroma however I wish the chilies actually came through slightly more.
T- Creamy chocolate, smooth espresso that adds a decent amount of bitterness, very light chili heat, finishes with some vanilla bean and a little bit of yeast that I've found in other Prarie beers. Very tasty, again I wish the chilies came out a tiny bit more but otherwise very well balanced. The yeast used also detracts a tiny bit from the beer but not as much as in the Noir.
M- Silky smooth, nice carbonation level for style, extremely drinkable for the abv.
O- Prarie Bomb is an awesome beer that uses the adjuncts nicely to create a tasty beer. While I wouldn't say it is quite as good as Hunahpu it is definitely up there with one of the better 12% non-barrel-aged beers that I've had. This is definitely worth trying even if you don't like chili beers. 1,152 charactersjaasen64, Apr 24, 2014

This beer pours as black as used motor oil. Some thin brown lacing hugs the sides of the glass as it goes. The aroma of coffee and roasted malt is present but so is the subtle spice from the pepper. It is not at all overpowering. This is an extremely complex and well crafted beer. The astronomical ABV is not apparent as it is all well balanced with the robust flavors of this brew. I am not a stout drinker normally but I loved this beer! 
Whatever you have to do, get this and try this beer! 570 charactershbensinger, Apr 22, 2014

A- motor oil black with a brown head. The head is nice and thick and dissipates very quickly.
S- lots of burnt notes with delicious coffee blended in with chocolate and vanilla notes. I don't really smell any peppers in there at all.
T- damn, so good. Tons of chocolate and peppers up front with loads of REAL coffee taste. The peppers give minimal heat but really let there presence known on the swallow. It sits on the back part of your throat. The coffee stays on your tongue for a long time and its great.
M- thick and full bodied. Very silky and well blended. 
O- an amazing beer. Everything about this beer is great and i would love to have tons more. 708 charactersmlhyatt, Apr 20, 2014
4.61/5  rDev +2.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a surprisingly robust dark brown, firm, thick head, with very good retention. Brew is nearly perfectly black out of the bottle, and super dark in the glass, like a glossy, liquid coffee bean. Sticky, thin lacing stretches down the glass.
Huge coffee notes hit first, followed by chocolate malt and roasted barley. Vanilla and cream, and surprisingly, yes, a little hint of chili pepper, which lends a spicy and vegetal flavor to the aroma. Vanilla is stronger on very deep breaths.
Taste lives up to the nose, balancing all of those effects in one. Coffee, roasted barley, and a hint of dry chili pepper spice (heavier on the flavor than the spiciness) are front and center; dark cacao mingles with the pepper (a little spicier now) on the mid and back-end; cream and vanilla work their way in toward the finish. Dry, peppery, and earthy as you move along. More chocolate as it warms.
Medium-full body, but a full-bodied flavor. Sticky, thick (but not exactly chewy), with a long, long thick finish. Minutes after a sip, I find myself still swallowing this dense brew. No foaming, minimal sting, and no (alcohol) heat.
This is a fabulously complex and thick stout, mixing together more flavors than are probably necessary. What is supposed to stand out: the coffee? The chili peppers? Cacao or vanilla? In truth, all of these are present, with none standing out disproportionately to the others. That's exactly the way it should be.

Minimal carbonation and lacing, no bottling date so don't know the age on this one. Smell is primarily coffee, with some vanilla sweetness and there is definitely evidence of the chili peppers. The taste parallels the nose, predominantly coffee, with hints of vanilla and chocolate, and then only a bit heat from the chili peppers on the finish. It is remarkable how well everything comes together in this beer. For as complex of a beer as this is, it is exceptionally smooth. A little too much dominance by coffee for my personal preference, but a highly recommended brew. Cheers 603 charactersVeganUndead, Apr 18, 2014
4.51/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.25 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I really tried to pour this one with some vigor to achieve a substantial head but only got about an inch. It is quite attractive though looking like foamy thick milk chocolate. Body is pour ink black in color. No light getting through here at all. 
Nose is beautiful mouthwatering mix of rich coffee and milk chocolate. This smell is a real treat in itself just delectable. So fully incomfrencing the nose right to the taste buds.
As I take first sip I really get hit with a tone of bitter, high quality dark chocolate. Brisk and attacking the tongue with long dry and complex tones. The coffee really plays well here but it also is very bitter and dark. The peppers only act to add a bit of a sour twinge on the back of the tongue. And I really search for the vanilla bean only to find it smoothing out this brew and adding a bit of residual sweetness on the back of the tongue and mouthfeel. 
This is a stout for big stout lovers who like theirs on the dryer side. This beer would probably age well for a very long time. 1,025 charactersSPLITGRIN, Apr 18, 2014

Pours oil black with an almost two finger mocha head. A thin layer persists, leaving some nice lace. 
Smells of coffee, pepper, dark cocoa powder, roast malts and a slight vanilla sweetness. 
Bold bitter and roasty notes dominate. Strong black coffee, bittersweet dark chocolate, ancho peppers, roasty malts and mild smoke. Smoorh, soft vanilla rounds things out towards the finish and traces of booze peek in and out of the other flavors. Deftly drifts between bold dark chocolate covered coffee beans and a more subtle pepper tinged vanilla. Dangerously easy to drink for 13% abv. 
Velvety, smooth, creamy, medium full feel with moderate carbonation. Bitter coffee and cocoa with a hint of pepper. 
Prairie has reached a great balance of adjuncts here. All four (coffee, cocoa, vanilla and ancho chili) play into the overall flavor, contributing to a well executed and flavorful stout. Bomb! is worthy of checking out and I'm looking forward to drinking more. 1,113 charactersThickNStout, Apr 17, 2014

Bottle to Prairie Tulip (Purple Lettering)
12oz
Batch 5 Orange wax.
Thanks to Will or CanadianGhetto for this one
App- A solid dark brown color with no transperency with a nice 1-1/2" slightly darker brown head that faded pretty quickly. The beer was deep and dense and poured like chocolate.
Smell- Right out of the bottle, I mostly get the cacao and the vanilla. Malty and rich like a milkshake. As it warmed more of the chili aroma came out as well. A nice mix. One doesnt overpower the other and you cant detect the nuances.
Taste- This was a very flavorful and layered and detectably smooth stout. I had a couple others with Chilis and it was too harse. The balance here of the ingredients is quite nice. The sweet of the vanilla and the change to the richness of the chocolate and then the subtle hints of spice was nice.
Mouth- A solid medium body, bordered on being a thicker beer but struck the balance nicely. The carbonation was a solid medium and was a bit bubbly and creamy.
Drink- A very good beer. I enjoyed it a lot. I was glad I was able to land at least one to review and enjoy this one. Prairie does some good things. I am happy to have some goodies in the fridge to try. 1,217 charactersFosterJM, Apr 15, 2014

A- Pours a deep brown, nearly opaque body with a light coffee colored head that rises to an inch or so, and reduces slowly to leave some lacing and a thin layer of foam. Very nice.
S- Heavy coffee, marshmallow, dark chocolate, dark fruit, some vanilla and caramel. Coffee and roasty malt dominate the nose. 
T- Yum yum.. first up is some very delicious vanilla beans, butterscotch, french vanilla, caramel. It's unusual for a stout of this magnitude to be vanilla-forward but it's been done, and in a very balanced, complex manner! On the follow through is coffee, milk chocolate, roasty malt, marshmallows, and some chilies. The aftertaste is charred and toasted. 
M- Rich, velvety, heavy bodied, low carbonation. Very smooth for the ABV. 
I've been looking forward to trying Bomb! and it did not disappoint. What we have here is a complex, balanced, sip demanding stout that rises above the rest. Seek it out! 1,013 charactersgcamparone, Apr 15, 2014

4.5/5  rDev +0.4%Purchased bottle in April maybe in Arkansas and checked it home on the plane.  Opened 11/11/14.  My 1,000th review!
Pours an oily black color with minimal tan head into cigar city snifter.
Huge vanilla, chocolate, coffee, roasted aromas...maybe I can smell a hint of the pepper.
Taste is big vanilla...lots of roasted malts, chocolate, and then ends with a nice bite of heat.  Its not over sweet at all....not over done with the heat...not over anything, its damn near perfect.  Chugable, yet full of so much flavor.  I absolutely love this brew, 546 charactersDrinkSlurm, Apr 10, 2014

Pours a dark, deep black, with a very small half inch mocha head. Not much lacing.
The smell is of incredible rich chocolate, roasted malt, and chili peppers.
I'm surprised by how chocolate forward this beer is- and I love it. Tastes dark chocolate brownie batter, rich and thick. Quite roasty as well. As the beer warms, the vanilla becomes present and lends some creamy sweetness to the proceedings. At the end of each sip there's a pleasant slight pepper twang that builds up slightly sip after sip. There is some coffee noted as well, but it's mild compared to the heavy chocolate.
Full, thick mouthfeel, creamy and delicious. Very drinkable for the ABV. Low level of carbonation.
Chocolate, vanilla and chili peppers is a combination that is pure gold, and this goes for more a chocolate forward feel than some of its brethren. 884 charactersGreesyFizeek, Apr 10, 2014

Pitch black liquid, one-inch, thick mocha head dissipates after a few sips to a rim. Nice lacing coats the glass during the tasting.
Chocolate malt, char, light coffee and peppers. Not much vanilla, but the choc malt is heavenly.
The chocolate takes on a more fudge-like flavor and the coffee comes out. Nice, mellow pepper burn accentuates the flavors.
Medium-heavy body, well carbonated, alcohol well hidden by the peppers.
Another in a line of stouts brewed with cacao and chili peppers. Well done but not in the class of Huna. 596 charactersCaptCleveland, Apr 10, 2014

A- Darkest brown almost black. Slight Caramel colored bubbles on top that go away instantly.
S- Chocolate,fudgy,coffee, vanilla. Exactly as the label reads. They nailed it
T-Fudge,cocoa,coffee. Second sip I get a little vanilla as well. Third sip Im getting all that and a suble shot of heat rounding it out, chilli? chilli chocolate? I get no alcohol from this and at 14% thats a well crafted beer.I've never had anything like this!
M- Light and creamy, not watery but not thick at all. Perfect consistency to carry these flavors. Makes it intensely drinkable.
O-Overall I nee to first say that I don't drink stouts. I have tried a lot of them but Im just not a fan of them. This beer has changed that. I haven't ever had a stout that packs so much well blended flavor. This beer is so well balanced, every ingredient plays its role to a T. I'm looking forward to getting my hands on this beer again hopefully. Try it if you can you won't regret it. 1,022 charactersEvahflow, Apr 09, 2014

4.92/5  rDev +9.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5I am going to update my review here after having a few of these over the past 3 or 4 months. I can say with certainty that this is now my favorite non-bourbon barrel aged, flavored stout on the market. Prairie has really outdone themselves here and managed to create a cohesive, excellent beer that most other brewers would turn in to a mess.
I am reviewing an orange wax bottle that was release in early 2014.
A - Thick, viscous, pitch black pour with a tan head. Nice sticky lacing left by the receding one-finger head.
S - Roasted malt and coffee beans are present at first. Chocolate begins to show up as it warms and you can get your nose in the glass. Almost on par with Chokolat as far as the cocoa aroma goes.
T - Complex, multi-layered. Up front is roasted malt and coffee that give way to the cocoa and the heat from the chile peppers on the back end. The vanilla has faded with age on this bottle, which is to be expected. I cannot believe how they pulled this off. Ecellent.
M - Full bodied stout, like an imperial should be. Very smooth finish with no detectable heat even with the high 13% ABV.
O - Hands down the best flavored stout I have ever had.
Next time this releases I am going to try and get 3 or 4 more bottles. 1,242 characterstpgraham, Apr 08, 2014

A: Pours dark black with half a finger of mocha colored head. The beer appeared very thick during the pour, as expected for the style and ABV. 
S: I get coffee and vanilla up front on this, with a lingering heat from the peppers. Not detecting hardly any chocolate. Clearly there's a lot going on with this. 
T: Coffee comes first, however unlike the aroma, pepper is clearly the second most dominant flavor, followed by chocolate and lastly vanilla. As it warms up the pepper becomes more pronounced, but never over takes coffee for the lead. After-taste lingers with a bit of chocolate. 
M: Velvety smooth, with an appropriate carb level. 
O: To say this beer is well balanced doesn't begin to describe it. There's so much going on here that it's tough to believe its 13%. I didn't have many expectations for Bomb!, and I'm glad to say it took me by surprise. 937 charactersroger617, Apr 07, 2014

4.97/5  rDev +10.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured from 12 oz. bottle into snifter. Burnt orange wax over the top. I will admit, my expectations are through-the-roof for this beer. From what I hear, this beer makes grown men cry. 
Appearance- Jet-black with absolutely no light shining through while held up to a bright light. Half a finger of dark tan head that sticks around for a minute or two. I cannot describe how black this beer is. It's what a black-hole would look like. (Assuming light could escape the intense gravitational pull, which it cannot.) 
Smell- Out-of-this-world! Coffee, chocolate and vanilla explode into my face. Chocolate chip cookies and mint too. I know this beer isn't barrel-aged, but you could have fooled me. 
Taste- Lives up to all the hype to say the least. I taste every single ingredient the bottle lists. Coffee and chocolate at first, then vanilla and chili peppers in the back. I know I am not supposed to, but I taste mint too. 
Mouthfeel- I am enjoying this beer too much. So much complexity for one liquid. I get the sense of coffee and hot chocolate then vanilla bean milkshake. I could take just a tad more heat from the peppers, but I refuse to complain about this masterpiece. 
Overall- Perfect in every sense of the word. I have given very few 5/5 in my 50+ reviews, but this beer earned four 5/5. This beer is constantly ISO in my opinion. 1,348 charactersfrenchblood21, Apr 05, 2014

4.14/5  rDev -7.6%look: 3.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.512 fl oz brown glass bottle with appealing colourful label and orange wax-ed over pry-off cap served into an Avery stem-tulip in me gaff in low altitude Austin, Texas. Reviewed live. 13% ABV. Reviewed as an imperial stout because the label clearly identifies it as an "imperial stout aged on coffee, cacao nibs, vanilla beans, and chili peppers." Distributed by the Shelton Bastards.
Served chilled. Side-poured.
A: No bubble show forms as it's poured.
Pours a quarter finger wide head of fairly rich tan colour. Nice thickness and creaminess. Decent complexion. Unfortunately, the head retention is poor - maybe 1 minute at best. No lacing sticks to the sides of the glass as the head recedes.
Body colour is a predictable opaque solid black. Not quite a jet black, but certainly nontranslucent and nontransparent. No floating yeast particles or hop sediment is visible. Appears undercarbonated.
The head doesn't set itself apart; it lacks the richness and vibrance of superior beers in the style. Not unique or special. There are no obvious flaws.
Sm: Rich cacao nibs dominate. It's not a dusty or powdery cacao character, but rather feels like a very evocative, saliva-inducing chocolate. Right behind it in prominence is some coffee of equally impressive depth, evoking a subtle roastiness and layers of java. The base is your usual dark malt and chocolate malt foundation, but it's unobtrusive and seems to let the more interesting notes shine.
As far as any vanilla beans or chili peppers? Hm. I do find hints of faint chili powder - as though chili powder cut with Mexican chocolate, but honestly I wouldn't notice the chili character without prompting. And forget the vanilla beans; I'm not finding them at all.
No yeast, alcohol, or hops are detectable.
It seems to have the perfect amount of sweetness and I think it's a lovely aroma for an imperial stout. There's some faint cream and just a hint of roasted barley - which plays with the coffee roast wonderfully.
That said, it's quite a timid aroma for a 13% ABV imperial stout. Certainly understated, but I'd call it subtle rather than reticent. It's teasing. I can't wait for the first sip.
As it warms, I am noticing more and more chili powder on the back end.
T: Gorgeous. The cacao nibs are the stars here, blending beautifully with the dark malt/chocolate malt base and the subtle coffee roast. Though it's worth pointing out that taken on their own, neither the cacao nib character nor the coffee character is particularly deep. I've experienced far superior individual coffee and cacao notes in other beers in the style, but there they blend wonderfully, and the balance is impressive. Warm Mexican chocolate-esque chili pepper/powder is present throughout, but gears up more in the 3rd act without feeling too hot or spicy. It's hard to execute chili notes so subtly. Vanilla beans? Nowhere to be found.
The ABV is also not coming through; this stuff is dangerously drinkable for 13%. There's no yeast character or hop character either, but in spite of the lack of noticeable hop bitterness the beer never feels too sweet as many imperial stouts are prone to; I think the subtle roasted barley and light coffee roast do the balancing instead of hops.
I pick up on some light cream, and could use more. Overall, this is a delightfully well balanced flavour profile with impressive subtlety, notable nuance, good complexity, and fair intricacy. Good depth of flavour and flavour duration. Average intensity of flavour. It's very cohesive, and nearly gestalt.
I'd like to taste the vanilla bean, though I suppose that would entail more sweetness.
Mf: Lightly creamy. Smooth and wet. Almost perfectly carbonated. Has a nice softness to it. As it warms, the texture feels more and more powdery, crumbly, and dusty - like an unrefined Mexican chocolate. In other words, it feels exactly like the aroma doesn't smell - if that makes any sense. It's surprisingly light and easy on the palate, with a modest weight and not much thickness. The result is a very approachable texture which bolsters drinkability. This is about as far from overbearing and syrupy as an imperial stout can get. 
Not oily, gushed, hot, syrupy, astringent, harsh, chewy or boozy - though there is some mild chili warmth.
This texture goes above and beyond, complementing the taste beautifully and coaxing out the nuances of the chocolate specifically; the mouthfeel and taste cooperate to create the effect of a crumbly cacao treat. Well-executed indeed. It's rare that a texture feels this dialed-in to a specific flavour, but boy does it work well here. Masterful work.
The tingly chili warmth is lovely.
Dr: Dangerously drinkable for its well-disguised 13% ABV. I'd absolutely buy it again. Any stout fan would do well to try this. I already want more. I'm glad I greedily kept this to myself instead of sharing it with friends. Some of Prairie's finest work so far - and that's saying a lot.

M - A bit thin, with a lingering heat.

Hefty doses of fudge and cocoa. Some earthy vegetal smell. Obvious coffee and vanilla. Pretty much as the label reads. 
The flavor is punctuated more that in the aroma, but all the same culprits. I wish it had some spicy notes but the vegetal variety will do and plays well with the fudge. Bitter coffee and bakers chocolate. 
Very soft and smooth mouthfeel with minimal carbonation. Relatively speaking (it is 14%,) it is smooth and easy to put down. 
A fantastic beer certainly worth some of the hype. All the advertised ingredients pops, but I do wish it had some heat in the finish. 681 charactersVonerichs, Mar 29, 2014

Appearance: This beauty poured an ink black that returned a thick cascading tan head. Lacing was abundant. A fantastic and inviting stout.
Smell: Wow. Big roasted coffee, semi-sweet chocolate, chocolate syrup and waifs of vanilla fill the nose. The latter becomes more fragrant over time. 
Taste: Coffee, dark chocolate, and vanilla are in full force at the front and middle. The finish provides the depth of the dried roasted chili. While subtle, the chili flavor is there and balanced very well. Alcohol is very well hidden.
Mouthfeel: Smooth and velvety. This alone keeps the glass near you at all times.
Overall: A family member tasted this and asked the ABV. As I reached for the bottle I answered 9%. I was a bit surprised to see it was 13%. This stout easily drinks like a 9%. The flavors are are so damn seductive and inciting. I didn't want this beer to end. This is a must try. 909 charactersdarthvohn, Mar 23, 2014

A - Pitch black with a beautiful tan head. Leaves a great lacing on the glass. 
S - Chocolate and coffee dominate but you can pick up hints of the vanilla as it warms. No chilis...yet.
T - A bomb (pun intended) of flavors. Chocolate, coffee, sweetness from the vanilla and at the very end a hit of the chili. Wish the heat would of been a tad stronger but doesn't detract from the beer.
M - Perfect. Best part about the beer (which I say rarely). So damn silky smooth.
O - One of the best non BA stouts I've had. Glad I got a couple bottles left. I'd say drink fresh but since I have a few gonna age and see what happens. As it stands now, great brew from Prairie! 699 charactersdav3290, Mar 23, 2014

Thanks to pushkinwow for the bottle!
Pours a deep black color with a short tan head with minimal/no lace. The nose has a great spice, hot and pungent chili peppers, sweet roasted malts and maybe a touch of coffee. A surprisingly balanced chili pepper stout, a really nice dark, roasted malt, dark chocolate, coffee but finishes with warm chili peppers. A nice thick body and standard carbonation, silky, smooth, round. 483 charactersmtomlins, Mar 21, 2014

A: Very dark with an orangish brown head that retains nicely with minimal lacing.
S: The aroma was not as strong as the taste, I could pickup on the coffee, cacao, and chili peppers the most.
T: Very complex and unique tasting. Notes of coffee, cacao, vanilla, dark chocolate, and chili peppers. I don't normally like chili in beer, but it complimented the other ingredients nicely. 
M: Excellent full bodied beer.

Appearance was quite enticing, I love the dark walnut brown head the quickly decipate. Smelled Roast coffee/hint of dark choco, chilles/pepper, vanilla, and well hidden booze. Tasted some chiles/pepper, roasted choco/malts, touch of coffee, and again well-hidden booze. Full bodied, chewy, creamy, and lower carbonation. 
This beer is awesome. I'd like to have more of that silky taste and this is very complex in a great way. I would definitely seek this one out again and every chance I get. 514 charactersMacTeo, Mar 18, 2014

M- silky smooth, thick body and medium carbonation. The cocoa and vanilla really stick to your palate making your crave more

Tons of fresh anco chilies. Lots of smooth vanilla. Super nice. I could smell this all day. 
Tons of carbonation, with very little kick from the pepper. It's damn smooth and very drinkable. Bitterness is mellow and sweetness is relaxed and well placed and not high-speed. Lots of vanilla, coco, nutty, robust, roasty, not a syrupy mess. Just a bit on the too thin side... Rubber finish without nasty bite. 
A bit all over the place, but still very smooth, milky, drinkable, fluid, and quaffable. A damn fine brew, but could use just a *touch* more refining. Recommended, but not worth selling the farm for. 706 characterschugalug06, Mar 16, 2014

This is par for the couse on impy stouts though, especially one of this strength. One of the most remarkable aromas on a beer I've found any time in the recent past. Huge aromas of vanilla, cacao, coffee. The vanilla aroma is wild. So many beers with vanilla in them the vanilla comes across as chocolate, or cacao, but this is vanilla and huge. Love the other subtle aromas too, chocolate, some earthy quality from the chili. Vanilla comes on first wafting over the palate followed by earthy pepper flavor. This all melds with chocolate and cacao. Alcohol pops up here and there but especially the finish, though it is hard to seperate the alcohol heat from the chili heat. Thick, rich, full, what else can you say. Overall the only fault of this beer is that it is slightly hot, but I don't think that could be fixed given the strength. Otherwise so amazing. 971 characterspmlondrigan, Mar 15, 2014

12oz. Bottle poured into tulip.
I can smell the chocolatey, vanilla spiciness as soon as I pop the cap. Pours a black, black, viscous body with a chocolate brown two finger head that dissipates at a medium pace. I can also smell all the ingredients: coffee, cacao, vanilla, and chile peppers. Taste is more, a lot more of the same, deliciousness that hit the nose. Overall, I really loved this beer. Really glad I was able to try it, and highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a complex stout that blends its flavors with the utmost harmony. 668 characterstbryan5, Mar 12, 2014

S: picking some bittersweet notes from the chocolate and vanilla, roastiness from the coffee and a slight spicyness that trickles down my nose, with the vanilla aromas being the most upfront ones. 
T: this is just so incredibly well put together! First comes a gush of vanilla that covers your mouthwalls, ob so creamy and delicious! As it goes down you feel the warmth of the chilies kicking in jus in the right amount. Once you finish swallowing and prepare your taste buds for the next sip, the bitterness of the coffee starts making itself present in your palate. As the beer warms up the coffee comes to take the main characters role as the vanilla goes into a submissive state. 
M: creamy, carbonated, luxurious, divine drink sent from the gods themselves! Rich and plum and so predispossed to being drank.

A - Pours a viscous motor oil black with a dark brown head of about a finger, which recedes rather quickly and leaves no lace, as expected. 
S - Lots of fresh roasted coffee is the dominant note in the smell, and lying just beneath is bittersweet bakers chocolate, roasted malt, sweet vanilla, and some very slight peppers as it warms. Really smells terrific, a much more pungent smell than the decent but underwhelming Vanilla Noir I drank a couple days prior.
T - Again, a large, fresh roasted coffee/espresso flavor upfront, which melds into milk chocolate, bitter bakers chocolate, and vanilla sweetness. The ancho chiles are more of faint flavor at first rather than any noticeable heat, but once it warms to around room temp, the peppers give a nice little kick in the finish. Just really well rounded stuff.
M - Thick, rich, and slightly chewy with some faint carbonation that's very fitting. Coats the mouth with flavors without being cloying or overbearing. The alcohol is also barely noticeable, just a little warmth in the throat.
O - A big improvement over the Vanilla Noir, this stout fires on all cylinders. The numerous flavors blend together rather seamlessly, and the alcohol is incredibly well masked. The only downside to this brew, which is kind of a big one, is the price point... $8 for an imperial stout is more than a bit expensive, and will certainly keep this out of any kind of regular lineup or trading for it more than once in a great while. But with that said, a delicious brew, extremely well crafted. I would recommend everyone to try this at least once. 1,676 characterscjoc83, Mar 10, 2014

The aroma has sweet chocolate in the front, almost like Southern Tier Choklat. Then onto fresh roasted coffee, sweet vanilla, and ripe fresh green pepper and capsaicin spice.
The flavor follows with roasted coffee in the front. Then onto big Choklat notes against of chocolate brownie and sweet chocolate. The middle hits of roasted coffee. Vanilla is generally a complimentary flavor in beer and this is true here. It pairs with the coffee and chocolate notes. 
The spice is really interesting as it hits on different fronts, although in a medium to light manner as this is not a very spicy beer. It hits in the front brightly and then attacks again in the back of fresh pepper. It changes on each sip. 
The beer finishes as the spice flows away with roasted coffee lingering. There is no sense of alcohol as this beer drinks like a 9-10% ABV imperial stout. The base beer definitely adds chocolate flavors, but hides as the adjuncts shine through.
The body is medium full and not very viscous. 
I preferred Mexican Cake, though it is definitely better than Abraxas. I do wish the beer was more aggressively spicy and maybe had a bigger mouthfeel. 1,234 charactersdar482, Feb 28, 2014

A: Black. Thin foam cap. Tan head. Stellar lacing.
S: Spicy chile, milk chocolate, big vanilla, subdued coffee. 
T: Chile throughout the experience. Meld beautifully with the chocolate and coffee. Vanilla sweetness is a great balance to the spicy/smoky pepper notes. 
M: Light for the style. Small bit of carbonation. 
O: Amazing flavors. My buddy wasn't as big a fan as I was. The chile peppers detracted from his experience. However, for me, they were a perfect counterpoint to the rich and decadent chocolate and vanilla notes. I only wish this beer were fuller bodied. It felt a bit thin in the mouth. Overall, though, I consider this an absolutely stellar beer and rank it as my number 1 non barrel aged stout. 733 charactersMcStagger, Feb 27, 2014

This is 14%?? Really? Holy balls this is smooth as hell with the oatmeal giving it a velvety texture. Im glad the pepper fades for the most part, though it compliments well enough....something I rarely find works for me in a stout. Its like a s'mores with cayenne. I would assume to add alcohol to that, but the ABV is ridiculously integrated to where it tastes more like a Convict Hill than a BCBS. This is my first Bomb, and I was skeptical of the high ratings and the red pepper...but this is one of the best high ABV stouts I have ever had. It is not as complex and fruity as a BCBS, and likely wont develop as much with age, but right now, this is a phenomenal beer. 914 characterstwiggamortis420, Feb 27, 2014

Smell: Dark chocolate and roast notes initially, but those are overshadowed by dank, dank coffee bitterness. Just excellent. Only a hint of chili and vanilla notes in the background. Very nice complexity, and the coffee notes are top notch. 
Taste: Very nicely integrated coffee, dark chocolate and vanilla notes throughout. Obviously the coffee is the dominant component of the three, but the other flavors definitely show and have a say in the final product. The added chilis really only show up on the finish in the back of the throat, but they do make their presence known. 
Mouthfeel/Overall: Very full mouthfeel with perfect carbonation. Hides its ABV incredibly well. Overall, hard to grade this beer out any less than excellent. It is very complex, showing a lot of flavor components, but still has one elite defining flavor (coffee) that sets it apart from most other beers. One to seek out for sure. 1,105 characterszhanson88, Feb 23, 2014

S: Strong vanilla mingled with the bold and slightly spicy roast of the malts, coffee, and cacao nibs.
T: As with the scent, the vanilla flavor is dominant with boozy coffee coming in after that. The finish is bitter and there is a very subtle heat from the chilies.
M: Thick and creamy.
O: A great imperial stout. I'd love to get a bit more presence from the chocolate and chillies but, overall, it is a very good brew worthy of the reputation. 518 characters01001111, Feb 23, 2014

Smell is great, coffee upfront, then vanilla and chocolate. Don't really smell the chilies much. Really pleasant all around.
Taste is strong coffee upfront, followed by a nice bit of sweetness from the vanilla and then a bit of bittersweet chocolate, ending with a slight kick of chili spiciness. All well integrated with one another and just the slightest bit of alcohol is evident.
Mouthfeel is a touch watery for me considering the intensity of the flavors involved. Not a huge negative or anything, but it is not on par with the elite examples of this style.
Overall this is a really pleasant and well thought out beer. The mouthfeel is the only thing that keeps it out of the truly elite Imperial Stouts. The chili element is nicely subdued, though I honestly enjoyed its integration here just slightly less than I did in Huna. Give this a shot if you can. 945 charactersmechamifune, Feb 22, 2014

4.4/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Enjoyed on tap at Bier Station as they unexpectedly got a keg of Bomb! along with their most recent Praire shipment. This would be the 2014 vintage and it was served in a small Belgian tulip glass.
Appearance - The body is as black as any beer I've ever seen, and the small cocoa-colored head, which appeared to be about a half-finger thick, has dissipated to almost nothing by the time the guy behind the bar is able to bring it over to me after pouring. All that remains is a thin line of brown around the edge of the glass, and no lacing. As I drink it down, some intermittent spots of lace cling to the sides of the glass in places, and when I tip the glass, the beer has noticeable legs, sticking to the side before slowly slinking back down to re-join the rest of the liquid.
Smell - Rich, almost overpowering, notes of coffee and chocolate do quite a bit of work in drowning out the other additives that supposedly reside within this beer: vanilla beans and ancho chilis. Instead the aroma is rich and roasty--like fresh espresso--with notes of the sweeter (but not much sweeter) cacao nibs. If I really work at it, I feel like I get the impression of vanilla, but it's entirely possible that my brain is just telling me that, since I know the vanilla beans are in there.
Taste - Again, the most present elements are the roasted coffee and bittersweet chocolate, which combine to create the impression of a cafe mocha, but much stronger and more aggressive than you'd get at your local coffee shop. Here, I can finally get a good sense of the other participants, with the vanilla showing through more as the beer warms, and particularly lending a gentle sweetness to the aftertaste. But make no mistake, it is very subtle. Surprisingly, the chili element is subtle too--with just a hint of pepperiness giving the aftertaste a little bit of bite, but it really does feel like it's fighting a losing battle against the huge coffee and chocolate flavors. I can also sense it with a faint bit of burn in the chest long after I've swallowed the beverage, but that could also be from the 14% abv.
Mouthfeel - Heavy-bodied and thick, like a set of chocolate-coffee drapes have been flung over my tastebuds. Very rich and viscous, with low carbonation, as would be expected for a barrel-aged beer.
Overall, a very delicious beer and one that I would love to get my hands on in bottle format to see how much some time would let the coffee and chocolate fade back a little bit and perhaps let the chilis and vanilla come to the front. But as is, it's a wonderfully rich beer that hides it's alcohol very well. 2,611 charactersLambicPentameter, Feb 21, 2014

a - Pours a deep brown, almost black color, with one finger of dark tan head and moderate carbonation evident. Looks very nice.
s - Smells of milk chocolate, cinnamon, vanilla, roasted malts, green peppers, light coffee, and toasted malts. Awesome nose; everything comes through and there is a lot of chocolate. Peppers come through but not too much, which is a good thing to me.
t - Tastes of milk chocolate, peppers, hot spice, roasted malts, vanilla, cinnamon, toasted malts, burnt malts, bell peppers. Taste is definitely good but has a lot more peppers and spice, and a bit of a kick to it. Little too much for me, so a step down from the nose.
m - Medium body and low carbonation. Light spice from the peppers but very easy to drink considering the ABV.
o - Overall definitely a good beer, but a little too much peppers and spice int he taste for me. I still would definitely prefer Hunahpu to this based on the taste (had a 2013 4 days before), and would put this on level with the normal Abraxas, with a tiny bit more spice in the taste. The nose is great and it is pretty easy to drink, and well worth checking out. Would like to try Pirate Bomb now. 1,300 charactersmdfb79, Feb 20, 2014

opened bottle, smelled chocolate/espresso cream.... poured into glass, still laced with Pliny resin, and got a nice layer of chocolate milk-looking head, mostly chocolate brown (of course) but with spots of white(?). strong chocolate aromas, no chiles, and a tad of dark roasted coffee. taste is very flavorful. lots of chocolate; smooth chocolate without the bitterness. slight espresso bitterness. some vanilla. again, very smooth... slightly carbonated, but not much. this is so much easier to drink then Bourbon County in comparing the abv. similar to a Mogli from Caldera in the huge chocolateness.... this stuff would be awesome over some vanilla ice cream!
considering the abv, and the taste, and the sweetness vs bitterness, this one is AWESOME!!! it's beautiful, although standard-looking on the pour, excellent in the aroma and taste departments, and just feels good even after it's down the throat. no nasty aftertaste. no bitterness; jus a lingering chocolate/espresso cream... cheers!
oh yeah... and I LOVE the 12 oz bottle!!! awesome stuff! 1,097 characterspkalix, Feb 17, 2014

Pours a almost thick black oil like ale with a massive brown foamy head. Beauty.
The aroma is really nice. Dark chocolate goodness. Cocoa powder, cinnamon, hot chocolate, and vanilla. Could smell this all day.
The taste is very chocolatey on the initial sip but brings out the coffee and roastiness turns out. The chili is very subdued in the bottle format unfortunately. Got a lot more from the draft. Oh well.
Slick and oily mouthfeel. Just a tad watery. 
Overall this is an outstanding beer. Unfortunately, the bottle version did not live up to the draft version. The draft version had every element on display, while the bottle version is a toned down version of all this can be. Still a world class beer that I will be searching for often. 787 characterskaseydad, Feb 13, 2014

Poured straight down the center of the glass leaves a beauty of a black pit topped with a golden brown creamy glistening 3 finger foam top that hangs on well. Lace covers the glass in a thick sticky webbing. Very pretty when poured properly.
My nose is met immediately by a bouquet of choco-coffee-vanilla sweetness. Like a highly anticipated dessert on Thanksgiving Day, this gets the salivary glands working double time. My god that smells good.
The tongue is met with a massive wave Nordaggio coffee bitterness. Whoa, perhaps a bit overkill here. As the taste buds recover from the coffee blitzkrieg, dark chocolate moves in followed by raisin and a blooming sweet vanilla takover. There is no pepper heat per se, but there is what I call a chile pepper "tingle" at the back of the throat and the sides of the tongue. Aftertaste is owned by coffee and a pepper tinge.
Silky suede-like full body feel speckled with modest carbonation. Sticky stuff too.
So glad to see Bomb! make it's way to Northern OK stores this time. Within walking distance no less! The only thing that prevents me from giving Bomb! a clean 5 is the intensity of the coffee. If the coffee tones down with age, it could get there for me. Anyone who loves big coffee beers will love this. 1,372 charactersDelMontiac, Feb 11, 2014

Pretty interesting beer, and maybe I would have enjoyed it more if I were a coffee drinker. Otherwise, for how popular this is, I was a little disappointed. 382 charactersyankeepride, Feb 09, 2014

Smells of brown sugar, some roast coffee and a hint of vanilla.  Taste is vanilla, milk chocolate, dark roast coffee, and a dry burn from the chilies.  Nice warming chile/alcohol finish.  Mouthfeel is light upfront, but the chilies and coffee leave a nice lingering oily flavor behind. Overall this is still a great beer (especially at it is becoming a shelf beer).  Perhaps not quite as complex as Huna,  but a bit more chile forward.  Definitely a favorite. 560 charactersOneEye78, Feb 09, 2014

A: Black. Pours a 1 finger, foamy, brown head. Settles fairly quickly leaving a smattering of bubbles and a thick beer ring. Very spotty lacing, quickly retreats into the body of the brew.
S: Roasted espresso, dark chocolate, vanilla, and chili peppers all prominently on display.
T: Tastes like is smells... dark chocolate, coffee, vanilla, and chili pepper. No components overpower the others. Well balanced.
M: Thick and hearty. High alcohol is not apparent. A bit of a peperry finish lingers on the palate.
D: Sip and enjoy.
Atmosphere is really nice. Nice head, very little lacing. Nose is a great combination of coffee, chocolate, and chili pepper. Roasted espresso beans, dark chocolate, chili pepper and vanilla all subtly presented and expertly balanced. Overall, this is a great quaff. 844 charactersbmwats, Feb 08, 2014

S: First sip, rich caramel coffee syrup, eucalyptus leaves, roast chipotles, play dough, and vanilla cola. Aromas of latex paint, black strap molasses and columbian roast coffee. Rich and decadent but graced with natural aromas that balance this ticking time bomb. 
T/M: Upfront carbonated water taste, follows by loads of velvety rich cocoa nibs and a slow building heat brings up the rear and tingles the inner mouth. Lots of earthy flavors, vegetation, roast chilies and medium toast oak. Booze becomes more assertive once warm and delivers dry smoky leftovers. 
O: An explosive grand tasting brew by anyone's standards. I really appreciate the delicate balance that was achieved with so many variables that were in play. The heat from the chilies help the bourbon create a heating blanket inside your chest. Makes me proud to be a native Okie. Cheers! 954 charactersHopswagger, Feb 08, 2014

Appearance - Very dark and thick during the pour. 1 finger of head was a bit of a surprise given the high ABV. A ring of foam stuck around for the duration.
Smell - Tons of Milk chocolate, some coffee, and a hint of booze. 
Taste - Milk chocolate, coffee (though not as much as the smell would indicate), bitter burnt malt, slight vanilla, and a hint of pepper. The pepper comes in at the end of each sip and becomes more apparent as the beer warms. Some beers are heavy handed with spice, but I feel the level of pepper is perfect here. This flavor profile is very complex and every drink leaves you searching to identify all the layers.
Mouthfeel - This is really thick and creamy - near perfect for this type of beer. It coats your mouth but not in a bad syrupy way. The high ABV isn't noticeable and the only tingle / burn is due to the pepper.
Overall - This is an excellent beer and dangerously drinkable at 14%. Would love to get my hands on more 990 charactersshadetree67, Feb 07, 2014

M: This is by far the smoothest beer I've ever had, even compared to the Pirate Bomb!, it's like drinking a milk chocolate candy bar. Very thick and creamy. 
O: This is the beer that every other beer I drink will be compared against because this, to me at least, is the gold standard and deserves to be in the Top 10 on BA. 619 charactersDrumKid003, Feb 06, 2014

The beer pours an inky black-dark brown topped by a thin, loose tan head that fades quickly. There appears to be decent carbonation, some lace while drinking, but no sediment. The nose is initially cocoa and roasted coffee when chilled - notes of vanilla, caramel, some licorice, and booze come out as it warms. The taste is predominantly bitter and roasty coffee upfront, which is then smoothed out by the cocoa and malt sweetness and finished by lingering booze and bitter cocoa. Chilies? Naw son, don't get the heat, flavor, or scent (though they are possibly contributing to the beer's bitter finish?). Otherwise, the beer has bold, identifiable adjunct flavors, nothing is too muddled. For being 13-14% abv it has reasonably hidden booze, which is no doubt related to its sweet, full body, silky mouthfeel, and generous carbonation. For a stout this big, it's quite drinkable and maintains that shelf-status appeal. I'd drink this again, probably not if I'm out somewhere, but it's certainly appropriate for that day when you're just hanging out in your PJays and decide it's definitely 5pm in the middle of the Atlantic, so why not? 1,161 charactersThePorterSorter, Feb 01, 2014

A: Typical stout dark pour, with a nice 1/2" tan head, that quickly dissipated. Scant lacing during the session.
S: Very nice chocolate and coffee nose. Buttery vanilla as well…
T: Not as exciting as I had hoped. Perhaps I was expecting more, and the chili is very subtle. Good dose of cocoa, and a vanilla finish. THe coffee is a little lost in the flavor, not as string as the smell.
M: Lively carbonation. Dry finish. Not cloying at all.
O: Decent beer. Might be better barrel aged? A lot of evenly balanced flavors, and can not sense the 14% alcohol at all.
EDIT: Had the PINK wax version tonight, updated the taste and mouthfeel to 4.5 each. Much better than the Blue wax version IMO. 738 charactersGeorgiaBeerGuy, Jan 28, 2014

4.6/5  rDev +2.7%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Pours out pitch black with a thin, tan head. Coffee and chocolate are strong up front with a hint of vanilla. I don't pick up much ancho, as I'm sure its raisiny notes get mixed up with the malty aroma. Chocolate is strong in the flavor, with the vanilla and coffee acting as accents to it. I get a lingering bitterness in the finish, which comes across as more hop than burnt malt/grain. I don't perceive the 13% at all, which is an incredible feat. The ancho warmth is very mild. If I didn't know it was in the beer, I'd assume it came from the alcohol, but it lingers a bit. Carbonation is a bit prickly, but the body itself is full. This is totally different from all the other Prairie offerings I've had (which have been fantastic), but it's equally impressive. 766 charactersgoochpunch, Jan 24, 2014

The pour is black and opaque with about 2 fingers of fine brown head that slowly dies down to a creamy foam. The nose is complex and very pleasant. I get heavy notes of bittersweet chocolate and coffee beans, as well as some sweet malty notes (vanilla?) and chili peppers.
The beer has a full body, a creamy feel, and a very engaging flavor. Sweet malt and vanilla sweetness up front, quickly followed by bittersweet chocolate. Then, more flavors join in. First, some bittering hops arrive and are quickly joined by some roasty coffee. Then, the coffee slowly intensifies as the beer oozes into the back of your mouth. Just when the coffee seems to reach unusual levels of bitter roastiness, the flavor transforms into chili peppers and joins a hint of alcohol heat to really warm things up as it slides down your throat. Coffee and peppers linger on the finish. Very drinkable for such a high ABV beer. This is one of those cases where the complexity of the flavor aids the drinkability. You focus on all the flavors as you sip and savor each mouthful, constantly looking for something you may have missed and quickly following up each sip to confirm your findings.
An amazing beer that is masterfully constructed. I'd like to rate it higher on taste, but I think I'm just not used to these ``Mexican-style stouts'' yet, especially the chili peppers. I just can't find that many examples (believe me, I'd buy them if I could find them). If I could score a few more bottles of this, I think I would get used to the chili peppers and the taste would eventually get bumped up to a 5. I really like the way the flavors of vanilla, chocolate, coffee, and chili peppers all unfold one after another on the palate. Prairie is just an extraordinary brewery. I have been delighted with every beer of theirs I've had. More, please! 1,870 charactersdeadonhisfeet, Jan 23, 2014

This is a review of an orange waxed bottle, released January 2014 - so about 3 years old at this point. 
First off I must say, despite BOMB!'s ubiquity around here I haven't had this beer since probabaly around the time I bought this bottle.  Just a bit over the top and rich for what I want to drink on a regular basis. Generally, I'm not big on "adjunct flavors" in my beer and certainly not multiple adjuncts in the same beer. That said, it's always been a solid beer - but at three years this has really mellowed to be really easy and enjoyable to drink.
Chocolate and vanilla stand front and center now, creamy and smooth. No bitterness from either hops or roasted grain is left, yet it's not sweet either. Chile heat is gone but a subtle warm toasted flavor persists.  Complexity comes from layers of flavor that include, burnt sugar, molasses, tobacco, and coffee. Impressively, for both an old and big beer, the foam stays dense through the whole glass.
I've been holding on to this for no real reason and decided to open it for no real reason. Glad I did, and I suspect the gold waxed I bottle I still have won't be around long. 1,180 charactersbump8628, Jan 15, 2014

4/5  rDev -10.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Pours pitch black with a thin tan head that dissipates rather quickly. Aroma of some dark fruit undertones, cocoa nibs, mild coffee, licorice, vanilla, chocolate and some sweet molasses. A sweet aroma which stays in balance and does not become cloying. Taste is savory and has notes of chili pepper, chocolate, dark dried fruits, raw cocoa nibs, licorice, fruity roasted coffee and vanilla. In the aftertaste you get the spiciness from the chilis which blend in nicely with the roastiness of the beer, but there is something missing in terms of complexity as a result of aging and the “fullness” of an imperial stout. Medium bodied with decent carbonation throughout. This was a dangerously drinkable beer with the high alcohol maskable fairly easy! However, I do have to go against the grain here and give this a rather outstanding rating just below excellent as there were several components to this beer that were missing in terms of complexity and being able to provide for a more memorable drinking experience. 1,019 charactersCuriousMonk, Jan 08, 2014

3.73/5  rDev -16.7%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 2.75 |  overall: 3.25A huge thanks to Jeff for this one. 12oz. bottle into a Cigar City snifter. Had alongside Pirate Bomb! and shared with schen9303. 
Pours thick and pitch black. Slight mocha head with poor retention but super thick legs. Lacing is spotty and stringy with solid stick. A menacing looking brew!
Nose is robust and very thick. Chocolate, coffee, espresso, fudge and molasses. Smells like my kinda beer!
Opens chocolate, cocoa powder, and coffee. Dark chocolate, liquorice, and a slight hint of prunes and molasses in the middle. Ends boozy with hints of cocoa and bittersweet chocolate. Solid.
Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Foamy and slightly prickly in the mouth and goes down abrasive and a touch grainy. Finishes messy with a lingering aftertaste. A touch too carbonated which results in a body that's a bit thin for the style.
Overall a very solid beer but there's nothing here to suggest that this warrants the lofty ratings it gets. I've had far better (but much less limited) coffee based imperial stouts. Definitely worth trying but not deserving of the hype. 1,079 charactersSpeedwayJim, Jan 04, 2014

4.65/5  rDev +3.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75I got a bottle of this during the mad dash release in DFW. Glad I got a second to age to see what happens. Here goes from my notes:
A - motor oil like in color and in viscosity (natural not synthetic of course); a black, dark liquid that pours very nicely into my tulip glass.
S - the bourbon and coffee are very present on the nose, with just a hint of the cacao nibs; I also picked up a nice roasted malt note.
T - very complex, the coffee and bourbon notes are most present on the front of the palate; the cocoa and vanilla come in on at the start of the finish with the heat from the chili peppers ending on the palate. As the beer warms up, the individual notes become more present and it is easier to pick out each distinct flavor. This is a complex bomb, just like the name implies. 
M - thick, but just right for the style. 
O - I'm very glad I shelled out for this, and glad I got a second bottle to age, just to see what it does. This beer has a lot of complexity that really plays with your palate. Very well done. 1,030 charactersTX-Badger, Dec 31, 2013

After letting it sit for a moment, the beer opened up with some spice, like peppers, and chocolate aromas. The flavors are similar to the aromas but more pepper and chocolate than coffee. 
With a 14% ABV this beer is not for the faint of heart. I very much enjoyed this beer after a big meal (as a dessert) and hope to see more Prairie Ales on the west coast in the coming months. 479 charactersMalWilkinson, Dec 27, 2013

Pours out dark as night with a one finger brown head with decent retention and nice lacing. Smell is of coffee and what I would describe a green peppers. They just seem to smell very fresh and a almost as forward as the coffee. I certainly smell some raisins and other dark fruits in the background. Seems to be some burnt malts in the background as well. Taste is coffee forward with some chocolate I didn't smell in the nose. I can certainly smell some burnt malt and the more I drink the more I taste nice peppers in the background but nothing is too overdone. Just a hint of vanilla too. This is a really well balanced beer for so much going on. Mouthfeel is actually quite thick for what I expected given the head when I poured it out. Overall this is an amazingly good beer. It's one of those beers that one waits to find but don't find very often to be sure. This is an amazing beer that is well put together that I would recommend to anyone who likes a tiny bit of heat (nothing too much) to round off things and add to the complexity. 1,194 charactersNeedBeerHere, Dec 26, 2013

The aroma is so strong with a massive coffee jolt. There's a spicy, smoky chocolate aroma that's so pleasing and then a finish of malty Graham Cracker.
The flavor is coffee-centric with a strong smoky, roast and char. Touches of spicy capsaicin alert the taste buds mid palate as this finishes with a light toasted malt and tobacco leaf.
The feel is sublime with a rich creamy texture. Advertised as 15 pct ABV there's barely an inkling of it, not even so much as a residual warmth.
This is a champion of a stout with nice complexity and superb peripherals. 724 charactersKYGunner, Dec 25, 2013

S - Cocoa, choc chip cookies, brown sugar and maybe a little soy.
T - Taste is pretty darned close to smell, but very boozy and more bitter than thought - pepper shines through.
M - Creamy, good texture, nice how it bitters out from the sweet malt.
D - My kind of stout. Huge though. Couldn't have too many. 402 characterssrandycarter, Dec 25, 2013

Appearance : opaque black with a dope tan color head - this tan color would make my favorite color work khakis -
Nose: musty chili and flavorful chocolate notes - and my favorite part - heavenly roasted coffee that just flys through my nostrils perfectly /
Taste : chocolate blast infused with spicy peppers - something I usually go for when shopping for chocolate bars. The initial taste of heat fades into silky smooth coffee followed by the burliness bite of a 13% abv brew - 
Mouthfeel: i would call this a half a step under full body - it sits comfortably on the palette. I take turns taking a small sip and a big swig of this -
Overall: on nights that I have this beer I fall asleep dreaming about the madness this beer would bring if it was barrel aged and distributed - this is a stout to be reckoned with and as long as they keep making this I will keep hunting for it . 1,030 charactersModernrickk, Dec 25, 2013

A - Black with a small tan head of large bubbles that dissipates quickly.
S - Initially heavy on the peppers and something a bit odd like bubble gum (especially the hard gum that I used to get in Topps baseball cards as a kid). But then it's more about chocolate, roasted malts and vanilla. It's much better as it goes on.
T - The chili peppers add a distinct flavor. It's as much about the flavors as the mild heat. But good overall complexity with chocolate, vanilla and a hint of coffee. Over the course of the glass, a slight lingering hint of pepper heat builds. It's a great start to finish journey. And I would never have guessed the 14% ABV.
M - Creamy consistency with a low carbonation.
O - A great and creative blend of flavors! 830 charactersGJ40, Dec 21, 2013

S: Big whiff of dark chocolate and milk chocolate, not so much pepper on the nose but its there. Some coffee and vanilla.
T: The initial wave of flavor is a blend of bitter dark chocolates and some milk chocolate/cocoa powder with a light hint of coffee. The peppers come on a wee buit but its not big pepper like Huna, pretty tame and I like it. A little bit of heat but it is very well masked. The finish is dry, more chocolate, roastiness and coffee. There is a nice warming sensation between the peppers and booze which is nice.
M: A nice robust body, good carbonation, lots of flavor. A complete treat all the way around.
O: An amazing beer, full of flavor, no major flaws and well crafted. Definitely worth the hype. 848 charactersbarleywinefiend, Dec 16, 2013

A - pitch black liquid, a slight mocha coloured lacing at the lip of the glass. swirl brings a 1/4 mocha coloured head that dissipates quickly.
S - bakers chocolate and coffee. the slightest hint of the chili peppers in the background
T - Coffee to start, transitioning to the chili's and then to deep, dark chocolate... a slight heat on the back end from the chili's - not overpowering, but somehow pulls the whole thing together very nicely. Alcohol is not noticeable at all.
M - carbonation levels are just right for this beer. Keeps it from being silky without making it prickly on the tongue. Easier to describe what it isn't than what it is... but don't take that for a complaint.
O - I was doubtful when I saw the inclusion of chili's, so a purchase a few bottles based on the outstanding score... very glad i did. This is a very well balanced and unique beer. Very impressed. 931 charactersBluestar, Dec 12, 2013

Consumed 12/11/13
Appearance: Dark, rich brown - dense, but some clarity around the edges - small, light brown head - leaves some nice spots of lacing
Smell: In a word, intense - tons going on, with a load of coffee and chocolate - smoky, burnt, roasty - nutty, earthy, with some smoky, vegetal peppers - big malts - cooked, caramelized malts, molasses - chocolate malts as well as some cocoa, dark chocolate, and semisweet chocolate - decidedly complex
Taste: An abundance of chocolate, burnt malts, and coffee - dark chocolate, baker's chocolate, and cocoa - some vanilla bean - lots of roasty coffee - very burnt and roasty overall - chili peppers aren't particularly prominent, but they are there, adding some vegetal and smoky notes - some dry alcohol in the finish
Mouthfeel: Full body, a hint of heat, smooth, with some nice dryness
Overall: The preferred drink of Bob-ombs
There are so many things going on with this beer. The notion of combining so many ingredients is not always ideal, but the kitchen sink approach actually works here. This is nicely complex and definitely memorable. 1,149 charactersangrybabboon, Dec 11, 2013

Appearance: Pours straight black. Head is a creamy red-tinged dark tan. A small splotch of lacing. Ok head retention leaves a small cap. Stnadard for the style. Moderate carbonation on the pour.
Smell: Loaded with cocoa and coffee. Bitter chocolate and nibs. Nice solid roasted compliment to the whole thing. Sweet without being cloying. A touch of chile heat through the back of it all. A touch of caramel malt sweetness in the mix. Nice hint of vanilla in the back as well. Chalky and deeply roasted. A touch of some citrus and earthy hints on the back. Tons of cocoa and even some bitter baker's chocolate. A touch smoky as well.
Taste: Bitter and leafy. Milk chocolate. A touch of old espresso. Creamy milk chocolate. Cocoa and bitter backer's chocolate. In case you were curious, nibs and it's chocolatey. A faint hint of smoky pepper through the middle. Nicely sweet with some roasted and caramelized malts. Slightly burnt. Coffee is assertive. Small hints of vanilla thrown in to the mix. Ancho is vegetal and slightly earthy. Nice depth. A touch of alcohol, but as big as it is, it's well hidden. Warming pushes the coffee and cocoa in to overdrive. So much cocoa it's insane.
Mouthfeel: Creamy medium to full body with a moderate carbonation. Slightly dry on the finish. Smooth.
Overall: *burn* *burn* *burn* *fizzle*
Perhaps a hyper fresh bottle would help, but this really came across as a coffee and cocoa bomb. There's a ton going on, but it just never really pulled itself together. Tasty, but not blowing any minds. 1,571 charactersGoblinmunkey7, Dec 11, 2013

14% ABV
Red Wax Vintage (2013)
Pours a gorgeous and sexy deep dark oily color with equal oily viscosity. A fairly aggressive pour yields some pretty weak bubbles that attempt to come to the surface and form a head but are unsuccessful. There is a light tan ring that still forms around the glass. Gorgeous. (5)
Strong delicious coffee aroma starts things off. Then some burnt and roasted notes of coffee beans and espresso. Fresh brewed coffee and spent grounds seem to dominate the early portion of the aroma. These notes are followed by some deep dark bitter chocolate notes and delicious bitterness with a mild underlying sweetness. Mild vanilla spiced sweetness on the back end along with some chilly spice. (4.75)
Starts off with strong coffee notes in the flavor similar to the nose. However, in the flavor, the coffee notes are a bit richer and less acidic than the nose indicates. The coffee notes are also very well balanced by some notes of vanilla spice and sweetness and then this is followed back by some more roast and some dark chocolate bitterness The middle has some mild boozy heat (it is 14% after all). The brew is surprisingly clean and each flavor stands out very well. They are well compartmentalized and not muddled. The brew finishes with some nice chili spice and some vanilla hints. The mouth feel is surprisingly light an doculd be a bit thicker. Still there is some lower carbonation and a nice dark cocoa and coffee bitter finish. (4.5)(4.0)
Overall this brew is worth the hype. Very well done with great complexity and flavors. (4.25) 1,583 charactersJoEBoBpr, Dec 10, 2013

A - Pours black with one finger of creamydark brown / chocolate head.
S - It's got a nice peppery aroma with some chocolate and roasted malt.
T - Good amount of sweet chocolate, roasted malt, coffee, and pepper. The pepper gives it a nice flavor, with more of a peppery mouthfeel than a peppery taste.
M - Thick and very smooth and creamy. This goes down easy, and the 14% is extremely well hidden. Very easy drinking for a stout of this caliber.
O - This is one great stout. The pepper adds a great other dimension to this, and the smooth creamy mouthfeel combined with the will hidden alcohol make this a fantastic beer. 666 charactersExaltedNecrosis, Dec 09, 2013

Smells delicious. Initially lots of coffee...lots of coffee. You also get some of the peppers initially on the nose. As it warms, the vanilla comes through.
delicious. Lots of coffee at first. The coffee dominates. Pepper on the finish. As it warms, like the nose, the vanilla comes through. You'd never know it was 13% alcohol. hidden incredibly (and dangerously) well.
Mouthfeel is pretty good. creamy, and thick, especially considering the peppers.

A: Pours an ink black, perfectly opaque. A two finger tan head forms that sticks around for a minute. Sticky lace is left. 
S: Big roasted malt and roasted coffee beans. Maybe a bit over roasty in the nose. Still, it works. 
T: Oh boy. Lots going on here. Roasted malt and coffee of coarse. Though so much more interacted than the nose. Milk chocolate, vanilla beans. Just a bit if heat, most likely from the ABV and not the chilies. Which is a good thing for me. 
M/D: A full body and moderate carbonation. This is silky smooth, perfectly weighty. Maybe the easiest 14% ABV stout I have had. Amazing. 
There is a lot to like here. I usually can't stand chilies in beer, and think it is a gimmicky fad right now. Here, thankfully that is almost an afterthought. I am also so impressed with the silky smooth body and so easy to drink. Most stouts of this weight are completely overbearing. If there was one Prairie beer I thought would be over rated, it is this. Though, typical Prairie makes another excellent offering. 1,153 characterschamp103, Dec 07, 2013

Black with a cinnamon head that puddles to the edges.
Big blast of coffee right off the bat. Big deep inhale pulls out the chiles to the point of feeling it deep in the recesses of my snout. Smells rich.
Peppers, roast, coffee, more peppers....a mix of green bell and jalapeno. 
Mouthfeel is oily....like drinking the dregs of a bottle of Marconi. Mike North recommends putting it on your shoes. 
Pales in comparison to Abraxas. The pepper juice aspect is actually tough on the stomach. Love spicy food, love peppers, love a good stout, don't love this. 699 charactersBarrytheBear, Dec 06, 2013

A - Deeply dark caramel coloring here, light frothy brown head. Fair legging and minimal retention. Good start.
S - Massive espresso, hot chocolate cocoa, light vanilla. It's nearly over-the-top on the coffee note. Little traces of alcohol phenols, which is great considering the abv.
T - Equally heavy coffee beans, lesser baking spices, black pepper, bitter and almost tannic in nature. I can't think of another huge stout that exhibits so much english barleywine quality to it. It feels miscategorized to me.
M - Medium-heavy body, plentiful alcohol warming, higher carbonation than usual.
D - Very unique. Certainly memorable but I'm not entirely sure what to make of it until I can get a revisit. 810 charactersAuracom, Dec 02, 2013

A: Pitch black - no light getting through this one. Medium brown head. Really nice looking.
S: Aroma explosion. Mostly dark chocolate in the nose with some coffee and roasty malt.
T: Way sweeter than I had anticipated based on the nose. Huge sweet milk chocolate upfront blended really well with hop bitterness. As the chocolate flavor fades, sweetness is left on the tongue and the coffee presence is more noticeable. The chili flavor was the last thing I noticed and it was exactly as prevalent as I hoped it would have been, not overly imposing at all but just a really note subtle note. I never would have guessed that this is a 14% beer.
M: Very smooth. Less thick than I would have imagined and medium carb.
O: Worth trading for. A very exceptional stout that boasts huge and unique flavors with great drinkability. 868 charactersanteater, Dec 01, 2013

A - Dark as night pours out of the glass like syrup, small tan foam head with minimal lacing.
S - Where to begin, this may have been the best smelling beer of the night with Roast, coffee, chocolate, vanilla, and peppers. Awesome smell and gave off more and more aroma as it warmed. 
T - Taste was as good as the smell, peppers were not prevalent which i do not mind as Abraxas has the peppers and cinnamon too upfront. Good amount of vanilla chocolate and coffee in the taste and they really work together well here. Very balanced 
M - Full bodied beer with a creamy chewy mouthfeel. It has all the qualities I look for in a stout. Alcohol is hidden perfectly and it goes down smooth.
O - This was quite an enjoyable experience and ended up being one of my favorites of the night. My palate was quite destroyed afer 6 huge stouts and several DIPA's

S-Wow. Just tons of coffee that unrolls to reveal vanilla and chili peppers. The focus is mainly coffee here, but the subtle flavors is what makes it stand out.
T-Just like the smell, this beer unrolls itself slowly. The espresso beans hit you immediately and at first feel like it will dominate the flavor, but the vanilla begins to mellow the flavor out and the chili peppers are most evident in the aftertaste and after a couple of small sips.
M-Thick, creamy, velvety. It's a thick beer, but not overly so. The carbonation is great.
O-A rarity, and understandably so. Although Prairie obviously wants to stand out with more Farmhouse flavors, it's clear they had fun with and tweaked this recipe to near perfection. Balanced and beautiful. A must try if you can get your hands on it. 860 charactersElprico, Nov 26, 2013

S: I smell a bit hit of chili peppers in the beer, as well as some vanilla. I'm worried that it's going to blow my mouth away with the heat. It's very sweet, with some chocolate thrown in. 4
T: The chocolate shines through the initial sips of the taste, but chilis take it over quickly. Not the most robust pepper taste of this chili stout tasting, the chilis are tolerable and actually pleasant here. I'm not getting as much sweetness, or any vanilla, on the taste. It seems to be more focused on roast, chocolate, and heat. 4.5
MF: It has a robust mouthfeel that holds up enough to balance the heat from the peppers. The finish makes you crave the sweetness of the initial sips. The 14% ABV is hardly noticeable. 4
Value: At $12 for a 12oz bottle it would seem to be expensive, but the trading value of this makes it worth it. Definitely would seek this out again. If you like chilis, don't wait for them to fade any more. 4.5
O: This beer really lived up to the hype for me. Balanced, delicious, all with an appropriate amount of heat. It brought out the best in a stout and in a chili stout. I can't imagine that barrel aging this beer will improve it. 4.5 1,315 charactersrusswbeck, Nov 23, 2013

5/5  rDev +11.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I went on a beer quest with my brother in law when we were both in California, Santa Rosa area, to find this beverage specifically. I hadn't heard of it before since I don't really have my ear to the pulse of the beer scene or whatever but his description was enough to pique my interest. As Imperial Stouts are my undisputed favorite style of beer, I knew I had to try it if I had the chance. We ended up buying the last two bottles in all of Santa Rosa (supposedly) and at $10 for 12oz (I was expecting 750ml when they told me the price) I was hoping this would be worth the cost. AND IT WAS.
Appearance: black as night, 100% opaque, poured aggressively to get a good head but even with the bottle more than a foot above the glass nothing happened until a couple seconds after the pour. Absolutely the thickest beer I've ever seen. Like, I started raising the bottle as I poured and it just looked like it was flat, then sloooowwly the the head formed after the bottle was empty and I realized that I was seeing something special. And I might as well throw the term "khaki-colored" in there because apparently you are required by law to say that about stouts. It looked like pants.
Smell: It was a couple months ago so I honestly don't remember this aspect too well, really to me it's not an important part of a good beer--more of a preview of what's to come. Seriously, are you going to find a great-tasting beer that smells weird and mark it down because of that? 
Mouthfeel: Just like the appearance, it was unspeakably thick, coated the tongue just like it should for a massive imperial stout. The 12oz bottle was small but in retrospect it's a good thing because if this was in a bomber I probably wouldn't have enjoyed it by the end. It's that hearty.
Taste: Literally the best tasting beer I have ever consumed. It's my first review but far from my first beer. Really I chose this as my first review because I have such strong feelings about it. Everything advertised on the label is in here and all in perfect balance: coffee, chocolate, a hint of vanilla, and just enough chili peppers to gradually increase the heat on the fade as you work your way through the bottle. On the first couple of sips I was disappointed at the lack of pepper, but it builds so subtly and gradually that it doesn't start to hit you until you're about halfway done. By the time the bottle was sadly gone I still had the tasteful burn to remind me of what had been. The "roastiness" of a stout and the pepper heat are such a perfect match, I can't believe this flavor combination isn't more popular. And 14% ABV are you kidding me? I can handle an alcohol taste just fine, but there is almost none to speak of in this brew, and it's the strongest percentage-wise that I've ever had. The best way to describe it is to say that it's an experience you will never forget. 
Actually, if you're reading this review and haven't had it yet, then you shouldn't get your hopes up because it was only brewed once. Why do breweries do that? If this was year-round I would have given them hundreds of dollars by now. Oh well, thanks for the memories!!! 3,132 characterskrustster, Nov 22, 2013

4.4/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4Consumed on tap at Mikkeller Bar SF. Very excited about trying this - I'm glad that the local distro gets this in quite often. Poured into a 20cl wine tulip glass. Just the right amount, if you ask me.
Pours a ridiculously blackened color - dark all the way, with some light brown against the light, but no way in hell is anything else going to go through this thing. Contains an off-khaki head, with some (albeit forced) carbonation streaking upwards against the sides of the glass. As the head recedes into a bit of a ring, it really looks like some freshly brewed espresso... Freshly brewed with chocolate and chili extract, that is, as the thickness is immediately apparent. As far as serious dessert beers go, this is top of the line eye candy in terms of presentation.
Wow! Tons of roasted notes, sweetened spices, and some fruitiness immediately hit the palate on this one. The coffee bitterness is extremely apparent at the front, and as someone who's worked in coffee shops before, this smells exactly like the same pungent, grainy characteristic of coffee beans as they are being ground right before your eyes. The chilies are there, but it's subtle - green pepper and white pepper notes, which soon meld with the roasted chocolate character, as well as a little bit of cinnamon, vanilla, and even a bit of maple syrup. Slight dark fruits, ranging from raisins to figs, but the highlight is the roasted flavor, and it really works well here. Best yet, the alcohol is meticulously masked - no burn, or anything. The sugars are covering it up, and yet, it contains all of the roasted and earthy flavors I prefer in an imperial stout. Win.
The flavor is more of the same, but it's definitely not as decadent as I expected this to be. Rather, it turns out to be a disgustingly easy beer to down, as it contains none of the syrupy, sweetened, or bold flavors that these kinds of beers usually drink. How is this possible? At first, it's awash with notes of roasted coffee beans and cocoa nibs, which soon meld into a brief sweetness cut with vanilla, nutmeg, and caramel. The raisin notes at the finish are delightful, but things get rather interesting once the pepper kicks in, as it adds a spicy kick to it - in a way, pretty much the same sensation as adding chili powder to a high quality hot cocoa beverage. The finish is cut mostly with a roasted grainy bitterness, which makes this easily drinkable. And, 14% ABV?? You're joking, right? This drinks like a beer that's half as strong. More importantly, the carbonation is probably the star of the show, in certain respects. It's just right, to the point where this neither too thick or thin, but rather just right so that it makes this an easy going experience, which is something I'd hardly say ever for a 28 proof beer.
I suppose the hype on this is well deserved, but don't think that I'd want more than 6oz at a time of this thing. It's delicious, and extremely well made to the point of hiding its true decadence and aggressive character. For its low price per bottle ($10, for what it is), this is something that I could buy regularly if I wanted something easy-drinking and wonderfully flavorful after dinner. To me, it reaches the heights that I like over-the-top imperial stouts to be - any further, however, is definitely pushing it. 3,308 charactersmagictacosinus, Nov 21, 2013

Real good looker, presented with a decent one finger collar, dark mocha brown with creamy bubbles and whipped up top. Good staying power, on a super dark walnut black body, eventually a thin collar sticks around which is quite dark as well. Impressive.
Nose is perfect roasted coffee, ripping beans going on here, lots of char and nuts strangely. For as much as there are other items added such as peppers, nibs and vanilla those are very buried. But a very KBS like bouquet here.
First thing on the first sip is that the beer is very light, even a bit fizzy surprisingly. However the flavors just jump and take over. Large piping dark roasted coffee, some slight sweetness that's a bit indistinct. Great pepper like action that comes out nice and black with the charring malted roasts, even a faint bit of somkey quality also. There is no heat on this at all for it's large fourteen percent body.
Really impressive and diverse beer, that is going to please any stout fan. Just wish this had a bit more body to it, but it's hard to believe this clocks in at such a high abv to match. KBS killer is a possibility. 1,165 characterssmakawhat, Nov 19, 2013

UPDATED 6/18/15 - On tap at The Anchor in Wichita
At Church Key. Poured into a small snifter.
Complex is stating the obvious. Are there better imperial stouts, maybe, BUT this is one of my top beers. Worth the effort to find! I knew this beer was highly rated, but I had not read the detail, so though the brewer indicates that they used chilies, I could not directly discern those tastes. 4.75
A – Pours black with a brown head that quickly dissipates, but easily brought back with a swirl. Good lacing. Some alcohol legs. 4.75
S – Fantastically rich aroma, BIG milk (probably the vanilla in hindsight) and dark chocolate, roasted malts, sweetness, faint dark fruit, coffee is subdued in my opinion, alcohol but not solventy 5
T - Rich, roasted malts, dark chocolate, low bitterness, on the sweet side, alcohol, but just enough, nice balance for such a huge beer. 4.75

Lots of coffee and chocolate on the front of the palate. The chili becomes more prominent as it warmed leaving some tingling at the back of the throat. The back of the palate brings vanilla and roasted malt. Mouthfeel is amazing, velvety smooth and rich, it has a full body with faint carbonation.

Batch 1 (gold wax).
Pours an opaque black with a foamy khaki head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Tiny dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, vanilla, cocoa powder, dark chocolate, and very slight chile pepper aromas. Taste is much the same with cocoa powder and dark chocolate flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip, but I am not getting any chile heat in the throat. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with a fantastic set of aromas and a nice chocolate forward taste. 736 charactersUCLABrewN84, Nov 16, 2013

4.44/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured at a bar and arrived black in the glass with a thin tanned head that sticks to the glass leaving lace and some leg action. Kind of impressive for such a huge beer.
Huge chocolate notes pop immediately as I dip my nose in the glass. Big ol' fudge to it. Sweetness. Roasted malt hangs in behind those bold aromas. Not any discernible pepper which is surprising when compared to tasting the beer.
The pepper pops so much more in the taste. Sort of helps with the huge chocolate and vanilla sweetness that permeates the beer. The heat lingers on the tongue but is done perfectly. Roasted coffee and malts. All the ingredients play nicely together.
Carbonation is fairly big making this beer drink dangerously easy. Doesn't feel like 14%. Super smooth. 
This is deserving of all it's praise. 797 charactersMattSweatshirt, Nov 15, 2013

Prairie Bomb pours almost black with a small tan head.
Rich smell of coffee and chocolate, not overpowering, but close.
Tastes of coffee, dark chocolate, vanilla, and chilis. Hides the 14% very well.
Smooth and creamy with a somewhat slick feel.
Was shocked at how good this was. The chilis did not overpower as I was expecting. Can't wait to see how this ages. I am not a coffee drinker but still find this beer amazing. 475 characters22Blue, Nov 13, 2013

A: Black with a really nice two finger mocha colored head. Given the ABV, I wasn't expecting much from the appearance, but this is a looker. Tons of lace coats the glass after each sip. 
S: An absolutely fantastic blend of vanilla, freshly roasted coffee and chili. The vanilla is rich, almost custard like. I don't know that I've ever come across this much vanilla in a beer before. The coffee isn't overpowering, but complements the vanilla really well. And the chili smells like roasted ancho, very smoky and dark. Together, these are incredible. 
T: Layers upon layers of mouth coating vanilla and chocolate. Mocha and chili round it out with just a hint of a burn from the peppers on the finish. Powdery cocoa, dark chocolate, fudge and some marshmallow. Finish has some light char, earthy pepper notes and just that little hint of heat. Tastes about 5%. I can't believe this is 14. Bravo, Prairie. 1,004 charactersnotchucknorris, Nov 13, 2013

A - Pitch black with one and a half finger brown head that fades quickly.

very dark almost black creamy small head, very little lacing, huge legs, pretty thick like motor oil. Head builds as well as lacing and legs! 
Nose is ridiculous, so much awesome coffee, fresh roasted great smooth coffee, freshly brewed too, that just takes over and it takes deep nosing to get past, then a dark malt, chocolate, cocoa, dark choc, a very nice fresh smooth vanilla, then a nice ancho chili, the coffee is sooo good! 
Taste wow, starts with a huge vanilla kick, so much great vanilla, then cocoa, dark choc and bakers, hot cocoa and etc. Then a great coffee again, freshly brewed and roasted smooth rich coffee, mild roast and very tasty, light bitterness. In the background, a nice ancho chili comes with a good ancho, nice light smoky character and earthy character from the ancho. Very little booze, all blended together nicely and balanced. So delicious! Finish is long, very little booze warmth, little chili pepper heat and little smoke character, nice long chocolate dark choc, little coffee and some vanilla lingering, so much awesome. 
Mouth is heavy thick and rich, long mouth coating, little booze warmth and pepper tingle, decent carb. 
Overall, guuuh! this beer is friggen amazing! 1,248 charactersjlindros, Nov 11, 2013

Appearance- Pours a rich dark ebony brown, not too heavy looking. A big fizz up in the snifter that yields to some agitated bubbles underneath, with a smooth 1/8 inch of soft head on top. A little leggy lacing on the glass, but not significant.
Smell- This smells amazing. Nice roasty grain bouquet dominated by single origin cacao, madagascar vanilla bean, charred butterscotch toffee, demerara sugar, smooth roasted coffee notes, and only a hint of peppery heat. Everything here is super well balanced. A nose in perfect harmony.
Taste- Acidic bitter espresso, robust vanilla, bitter chocolate, burnt creme brûlée. A touch- and i mean a tiny little subtle touch of pepper comes through on the finish. Strong flavors at work here- but not rich and complex. Very straightforward, and even a bit thin. A super flavorful big stout without being rich, dense, and mouth-coating. If there is a flaw- it's here, where others of the style are a bit more rich.
Mouthfeel- Smooth, even a bit fizzy, and surprisingly thin for the style. Not at all oily and overpowering. Like the taste, the mouthfeel is fitting. Drinks like its a lot less powerful. Quite refreshing for the style, in that it is not a big, slick dense feel. No issues with this given its straightforward flavor profile. Smooth like a stout should be.
Overall- Very well done. A stout that packs a ton of flavor, with some great ingredients, that does not come across as overly thick, dense, or overpowering. This is a very accessible stout- even for people leary of "heavy" beers. Proof that stouts can be packed with flavor and not super-dense. Well done Prairie.

Appearance. Pours black with a thin espresso foam head. 
Smell. Dark roast coffee and cocoa powder, spicy hot peppers, some dark roasted malts, molasses, and a light woodiness though I don't think this is barrel aged. 
Taste. Dark roast coffee and vanilla, dark chocolate ...the kind that's almost all cocoa, bitter and not sweet. The chillies make an appearance in the finish but the alcohol is dangerously well hidden. 
Mouthfeel. Medium-full body with lowish carbonation. Seems like there should be a little more body here.
Overall. Great stuff, and a good choice for a breakfast beer. Not sure how the rest of the day is going to go, but I'm sure it will involve a nap despite the strong coffee in this. Thanks again Steasy66. 849 charactersRutager, Nov 08, 2013

A. Poured a very dark brown with a frothy amber head that very slowly retreats to a rim of similar characteristics.
S. Wow. Lots going on here. Certainly heavy on the dark roasted malts, dark chocolate, coffee, and yes, a noticeable pepper note. Minor hints of marshmallow, hops, straw, and grain. Moderately fragrant.
T. Wow (x2) The taste has major notes of bitter chocolate, coffee, dark roasted malts and hints of vanilla, toffee, and yes red pepper. A lingering aftertaste of bitter coco and red pepper.
M. Light but fine carbonation. Fairly smooth. Full bodied. A silky texture. Highly viscous.
O. This is a great stout with lots of flavor, but maintains strong RIS characteristics. The booze is well hidden and the red pepper is just right, which is very surprisingly. Putting red pepper in beer seems like a dumpster fire in the making, but they pulled it off. The flagship ale from this wonderful brewery. 947 charactersmacher0, Nov 05, 2013

I cant say enough about this really. its beer drinkers beer, just wish it was more readily available. expect this stuff to blow up to whale status before long, its that good. 1,363 charactersStonedTrippin, Nov 04, 2013

Ok…
Smell: Excellence. Like when my baby mama hops fresh out of the shower after using Clinique body wash. I mean, the scent from this doggone sucker is near perfection. Coffee, bitter dark chocolate, a roast quality…
Taste: Ay wey. This is where the letdown comes in like your cousin that you didn't wish was your cousin. A bit sour…initial taste is like in the 7th grade when the Heinz bottle lands on that one girl that no one wants to kiss. Ay mami!
Mouthfeel: If Natalie Portman were auditioning for Black Swan Two, this would be it. Thin! Thin! Thin! Way too thin!
Something must be wrong here, my children. Something must be seriously wrong.

About 8 months later and Raul finally got himself another (sans wax :*(
Damn. Something was wrong last time because this bad boy is all right. Not "alright," ALL RIGHT. Like, everything done right like the Dodgers in '88. I wish I could bottle the smell...wait, it comes in a bottle. Ok... But those things that Raul wasn't feelin' before are basically gone (that nasty sweetness, mainly). Still a tad thin, but overall all kinds of smooth like LAX with a fresh tar job.

Smell- Pure stale coffee and sweet vanilla. This is the second time I've had this and didn't notice the vanilla the first time but it really makes a difference.
Taste- So much going on but even at 14% there is no hint of booze. It starts off with a good mix of bitter chocolate and the same stale coffee on the nose. Next up is the vanilla and then the chili comes at the end washing everything away leaving a small tingle in the back of the throat.
Mouthfeel- Thick and full but leaves a bitter mouth coating aftertaste which is probably my least favorite part of this. 
Overall- I've had this twice now, the first time was more vanilla forward but this bottle seemed a little chili heavy. Both were very good and this is an excellent beer overall. Made a perfectly timed trip to Oklahoma and scored 3 bottles, hopefully Ill be able to pick up a couple more in the future. 1,035 charactersJfriz25, Nov 01, 2013

First, the damn wax is a pain in the arse to get off, there seems to be a weird semi-lip that I have to pry off to get the bottle opener underneath the cap. That Maginot Line breached, the liquid that comes out is black, mildly carbonated. The nose ratchets up the anticipation with a fire hose of chocolate & coffee, with a detectable level of vanilla underneath. One of the most aggressive smelling beers I've had in some time. 
Prairie Bomb! is a bit like getting a chile jolt from the electric chair. Chile heat is the first & most noticeable component, a low simmer that sets up camp in the base of my throat & belly...but it really obliterates the other ingredients. I can detect the chocolate & vanilla if I try hard enough, but they're refugees in a sea of chile. The coffee so prominent in the nose is tied off to a slightly roasted edge. Good to drink, but I can sense the 3:30 AM acid reflux already. Should have split this with my wife. 
In retrospect, this needs some time for my palate. The wonderful nose promises that as the chile dies back, there are going to be lovely complexities to the taste. Right now? Close to a one-note Charlie. Still good, but is going to be great (I think) in 6-12 months. 1,396 charactersmaximum12, Oct 31, 2013

The beer pours a jet black color, opaque and thick, about a finger of khaki head that has good retention and leaves one or two spots of lace behind. The aroma is very pleasant, lots of complexity, chocolate hits straight away, quite rich, big roasted coffee presence behind it, a bit of vanilla comes through but it's masked by the richness of the chocolate and sweet grain. The pepper comes through nicely, subtle heat but a very dominant vegetal quality that clashes a bit with the other components. The flavors read much like the nose, lots of chocolate quality, smooth, rich, decadent, roasted coffee is right behind, the vanilla doesn't quite comes across this time, but the sweetness of the beer makes up for it. Again, the pepper is nicely integrated, subtle heat that lingers well with a mild vegetal flavor, true to the pepper itself without getting oniony. The true wonder of this beer is how artfully the alcohol is hidden. The mouthfeel is great, luscious, rich, coats the mouth well, low carbonation with just enough zip that finishes smoothly and easily with just a touch of peppery bite.
Verdict: A really fine stout from Prairie and one that uses all the adjuncts well. The vanilla could probably stand out a bit more, but honestly, there is enough going on in this beer to satisfy. The alcohol is hidden perfectly and the balance is quite nice, a definite success. 1,482 characterskevanb, Oct 28, 2013

12oz stubby bottle pressure cap coated with red wax.
poured into tulip glass.
Appearance: dark black bodied beer with 1 full finger of medium brown head. Drops down to a thin cap and eventually a thick ring around the glass. This beer has a little bit of legs on the side of the glass and does stain the glass a little bit.
Smell: Big roasty malts kick things of with chili peppers in a very close second. Hint of cocoa powder that smells dry. A slight vanilla note adding some sweetness to the stout, but you really gotta search for it. 
Taste: Quick snap of vanilla sweetness, huge roasty coffee, and then earthy chili's that match the intensity of the roasty coffee and dark malts! The chili's provide a nice level of heat so you know this beer is brewed with peppers! The best part is that it the peppers do not cover up all the other flavors in this beer. The peppers heat does seem to build up a little bit as you sip on this beer, but peppers dont get too hot. Complex finish filled with roast notes, molasses, light tobacco note, hint of vanilla, moderate peppers and cocoa powder, finally a touch of spicy booze that seems to play off the peppers earthiness and heat. This is awesome. As it warms up you get this great vanilla marshmellowy sweetness that melds into the peppers flavors nicely... never tasted anything like that, but I am a fan!
Mouthfeel: medium bodied beer with carbonation levels that are on the high end of low carbonation. Its almost moderately carbonated, but not quite all the way to moderate carbonation. Pretty smooth beer at 14%. Its like the heat of the peppers hides the booze in this beer. The beer feels slightly viscous and oily with a little silky creaminess to it. 
Overall: This is probably the best stout to come out of the state of Oklahoma! I cant wait to try Pirate bomb! Really take your time with this beer and just sip on it. It is a stout worthy of savoring. I thought that this would be just like CBB Huna, but it seems to have something different about it that I cant put my finger on what it is. Almost all the same ingredients as Huna, but a little bit of a different animal than Huna because it not brewed with cinnamon. I was going to call this "Huna from the Prairie" in my review, but I am not sure that is what this beer is... Its got it own identity. 2,354 characters4DAloveofSTOUT, Oct 24, 2013
4.31/5  rDev -3.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4.512oz stout-shaped bottle, blue wax sealed, and procured at Tipsy's Liquor World in suburban Denver a few weeks ago.
This beer pours a solid, abysmal black, with only the slightest hints of basal cola edges, and two fingers of puffy, silky, and tightly foamy mocha head, which leaves a large swath of spooky webbed lace around the glass as things sink away.
It smells of bitter dark roast coffee, medium baker's chocolate, earthy vanilla pods, an obfuscated caramel/toffee malt, and some musty, dusty weedy hops. The taste is more bitter cafe-au-lait, tending more to the former, dry powdery cocoa, bready, somewhat grainy caramel malt, a touch of astringent wood, a slight, slowly building red spicy warmth, one which hides any alcohol edge that must be brewing, and a mild green vegetal hoppiness.
The bubbles are quite understated, barely generating a wee frothiness, the body a sturdy medium weight, and mostly smooth, but for a growing spice and alcohol insurgency. It finishes surprisingly off-dry, the sweetness of the malt and cocoa wresting a bit of the floor away from the coffee and spice guests.
Woooweee. One deliciously complex, and well-integrated imperial stout. Not too sweet, not too spicy, and definitely not too boozy (in the external sense, at least), rather, a deft blend of all these things, so much so, that this drinks like a regular, if still coffee and chili infused, dry stout. That said, I did my best to slow down and enjoy this, for I won't be able to get my hands on another bottle anytime soon, and of course, the more obvious reason - the 28-proof alcohol. Again, wow. 1,605 charactersbiboergosum, Oct 24, 2013

Sweet robust malt aroma with lots of dessert-like chocolate notes along with subtle cinnamon spice and hot peppers.  Strong chocolate sweetness with tootsie roll flavor, subtle vanilla bean and zesty spice.   Decent amount of toast but boy acrid or burnt.  Some silky lactose sugar giving it a Chocolate milkshake character.  Peppers and cinnamon stand out as it warms.  
Full body with silky, viscous mouthfeel.  Palate is dominated by sweet decadent chocolate, roasted dark malts and spicy chilies.  desert like chocolate malt sweetness with hints of tootsie roll, lactose, vanilla bean and bitter dark chocolate. Good balance of sweet and toast with bakers chocolate and gooey fudge countered by burnt toast, coffee bean and oatmeal.  Spice presence opens up as it warns with strong cinnamon and roasted pepper flavor.  The heat and spice are well integrated resulting in a mole like combination of flavors.  and nice balanced with desert like.  Complex with a well masked ABV making it deceptively drinkable. 1,191 characterscorby112, Oct 21, 2013

A: Deep, dark black with some light cherry color, and a finger of dark mocha head. Nice tight bubbles.
S: Wow factor from the coffee and chocolate, with some slight vanilla and chili notes in the background.
T: Dominated with coffee, chocolate, and roasted malts; only slight chili pepper, which is the way I like it. The chili stands out more on the finish, as does the vanilla.
M: Wow, this is 14%? Crazy. Also, the beer does come off slightly thin for being an imperial stout, but that's about all I can come up with. The carbonation is decent, and it does have a decently velvet-like feel.
O: Great beer, was a little worried about the chili as I don't like spicy things but it was a nice compliment to the other flavors. You do notice the chili a little more once the beer warms. We'll see how this does with some barrel aging, hopefully I get my hands on Pirate Bomb. 906 charactersmkotsayfan, Oct 19, 2013

4.36/5  rDev -2.7%look: 4.25 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4.25Next great brewery to come to Indiana: Prairie. We Hoosiers have truly been blessed by the beer gods. Cheers!
A: A deep, impenetrable black body pours syrupy from the bottle; a half-inch head of dark brown fizz appears above, shining slick and iridescent in the light. Minimal lacing.
S: No mistaking the “wow” factor here – the aromas here are robust and phenomenally intoxicating. Centers around a bold cascade of fresh-ground coffee, bittersweet European chocolate, warm maple syrup, and toasted marshmallow; chili powder and bourbon barrel add a spicy note to it. It’s all rich and impossibly deep, a nose so dark and alluring you can’t help falling into it. Stunning.
T: Starkly different from the nose, but with some exquisite tastes of its own. To start, it drinks mainly like a beer of a different style, with toffee malts, hot chili pepper, toasted coconut, and a hop taste of black pepper and pine at the fore. Residual sugars, surprisingly, do little more than add a cola-like metallic twang that resonates with the spice; as such, the sweetness promised in the nose is undermined by a bright, zesty upswing you’d expect more in a winter warmer or some other heavily-spiced brew. Towards the back end are more stout-friendly flavors of toasted bourbon barrel, molasses, burnt sugar, and espresso. The finish, though, is earthy and spicy: lingering chili pepper heat on top of ashy campfire.
M: For 14% alcohol, this isn’t exactly what I expected: there’s a thinness to the body that can’t go unnoticed. In fact, it’s the worst part about this beer, and probably the only thing about it that’s keeping it from being one of the truly great stouts I’ve ever tasted – believe me, it’s that jarring.
O: Thicken the body and you’ve got a KBS killer on your hands. However, a thin texture, coupled with the thinning flavors of metal and spice, make for a flawed beer. Apart from that, though, this beer is excellent: you can tell that it was expertly crafted by brewers who have experience making quality products. Needless to say, I’m excited to see what else Prairie brings to town. 2,125 charactersBarryMFBurton, Oct 17, 2013

A: Viscous black with a little beautiful espresso-like foam. Excellent retention but minimal lacing.
S: Loads of beautiful coffee with nuts (hazelnut), dark chocolate bar, and some vanilla bean. The flavors meld together nicely.
T: Dry cocoa, medium roast coffee grounds, more cocoa, with a finish featuring nuts, coffee bitterness, a little supporting vanilla on the back palate, and mild chili bite. The taste is surprisingly dry, but I guess that goes with the whole Mexican chocolate-like stout. 
M: Medium-light carbonation and body. Seems a bit thin for the ABV and overall combination of flavors.
O: Nice flavors and well crafted. The most noticeable deficiency is the thinness of the body. A little more heft would really support the flavors better. 785 characterspmarlowe, Oct 17, 2013

A-The brew pours thick and syrupy from the bottle. Even a heavy pour doesn't produce much foam, just a thin cap that fades quickly. The beer is nearly black...sort of an inky brown. 
S-The smell provides lots of brewed coffee notes, a touch of bitterness, and a mild but distinct hit of chile spice. Another sniff reveals creamy, milk chocolate and vanilla notes that give a slight cake batter scent. Really impressive in terms of layering and complexity. 
T-The taste is also a layered experience with waves of smooth coffee; sweet, creamy chocolate; vanilla; cocoa powder; and chile powder. There is not a trace of alcohol until the beer gets to room temperature and even then, the alcohol is only vaguely warming. The chile is well-done and doesn't over-power, but rather tickles my throat on the finish, and compliments the remaining flavors.
M-The carbonation is surprisingly assertive, which helps to keep the brew from becoming cloying. Overall heft is medium for the style.
O-This is a fantastic beer; one of my favorites of any style. The layering of vanilla, cocoa, coffee, and chile could turn into a train-wreck, but it works well here because all of the flavors are inserted with restraint. Each component mixes and compliments the other components, rather than competing with them. Awesome beer. 1,349 charactersspoony, Oct 13, 2013

A: dark brown/black (amber hue on edges when held to light)
Revisit: pour looked thick and oily.  No carbonation rising on a medium pour - just some straggling bubbles.  Somehow a fishing wire line of bubbles appear at edge
S: chocolate and coffe, roasted malt-style, with a hint of vanilla
Revisit: same, but very rich in its impression
T: more chocolate than coffee, and the vanilla is more present. I had noted other reviews' mention of chile and forgot, but I noted something different in the latter part of the taste. My girlfriend reminded me while reading one of those reviews, and a light bulb went off! It's subtle but obvious, and very interesting.
Revisit: definitely rich chocolate, the nibs I am starting to recognize in beers as I've had more.  Vanilla and actually a raisin/rum fig flavor makes an appearance.  Alcohol provides a little heat and I still get the hint of chili pepper.
M: little alcohol tinge, but stands up for the style of a malt-roasted beer
Revisit: Full bodied, but a bit oily and coating of the mouth.
O: a wonderful beer that has a few things going on, but it's gravy on top of a solid imperial stout. I am enjoying this style more and more, thanks to beers like this.
Revisit: lived up to my recollection.  Wish it looked a little better, but a minor flaw in a wonderful beer. 1,394 characterscjgiant, Oct 11, 2013

T- the flavor is similar to the nose, but perhaps slightly muted. A good punch of coffee roast and bitter dark chocolate. Smooth vanilla bean and a hint of chili. This really comes together as it warms to room temp. Reminds me a bit of Victory at Sea with a hint of chili pepper.
M- Mouthfeel is medium, and smooth with light carbonation.

09/2013 release
A - Black liquid with a thin dark drown frappa head that swirls on top.
S - Coffee grinds, cocoa, and vanilla. It says it right on the label but it's all very present. The chocolate mixes back and forth between dark and milk chocolate. Smells like a roasted whopper.
T - Intense roasted malts, decadent chocolate infused with chile heat that provides a mild heat and quite a bit of flavor as well. Roasted coffee is there but stays behind the chocolate. Vanilla mixes harmoniously with the coffee and chocolate. It's just the right amount of sweetness. As it warms a smokyness comes out. Finishes malty with roasted bitterness. The chile heats continues long into the finish
M - Moderate micro bubbled carbonation, soft and velvety feel, full bodied and viscous.
I love this beer! I like it better bottled than on tap. An explosion of chocolate and coffee with a chile pepper bite. What's not to love? Drink this one fresh!!!! 974 charactersStaveHooks, Oct 06, 2013

Poured a 12 oz., silver waxed bomb into a large snifter. 
A: Pitch black in body, with a dark, milk chocolate colored head. Thin head, but thick and viscous body. 
S: The nose of this beer is what beer drinkers dream about. Roasted coffee, spicy and sweet peppers, a bit of malt, dark chocolate...extremely layered and really holds throughout the drink. 
T: Phenomenal. Coffee heavy, but necessary to balance out the 14% ABV. The peppers are a bit muted when cold, but really come to life as the brew warms. Tons going on here, and it really becomes a different beer as it warms and opens up. 
M: Heavy on the palate and in the stomach. One Bomb will likely be all you need on the evening. Can't imagine your palate being able to go back to a pale ale after this beer, and other stouts wouldn't hold up. 
O: This beer is fantastic. It is really a good 45 minute to an hour long beer. Fun to sip and notice the changing flavors. Will age a few to see if they continue to open up, but it is imminently drinkable at present. 1,143 charactersjshusc, Oct 02, 2013

A very dark brown, ruby on edges, I can see my reflection in the beer(am I getting deep here?) thin ochre head with moderate retention and poor bubbly lacing, nice alcohol legs.
After reading the label I am expecting more than what is present on this nose, light cocoa, choc nibs, roasted coffee, touch of vanilla, but nothing obnoxious here. Barely a hint of pepper.
I am so glad I drank this at near room temperature. The chilli notes are just poppin! The chocolate nibs hit me first in a pulse of soothing bitterness. My tongue rolls over the expensive roasted espresso, dark malts, smoke, touch of vanilla sweet, and then the balancing heat. Chili stouts are so cool when well done(puns abound!). The capsaicin is unyielding and hold heat to your palate for that next sip. What a ride!
Full body, moderate carbonation, chewy, sticky.
Honestly, I just sipped on Hunahpu this weekend and this might be drinking better at this time. The pepper here is less vegetable and more heat and everything is just working well together. I wonder how it will age? It is so yummy I don't know if I will get to find out...will seek this one out. Barrel age this!!! 1,239 characterswilliamjbauer, Sep 30, 2013

S - coffee and spice to the extreme! Some cocoa nibs at the front for the bitterness and pepper at the back to give it a spice kick.
T - very clean blend. Cocoa dominates the front with a pepper/chili hint on the back that compliments the overall profilePeppers do dominate but play nice with the chocolatey sweetness as dusty coffee notes cut through slightly. Faint vanilla flavors on the backend.
M - medium high mouthfeel. Creamy texture. High carbonation along with everyone else reports
O - favorite of the series so far. Strong coffee and cocoa influences with a perfect chili balance for my liking; others found it a little too much. If you lie chili, coffee, or cocoa this beer does an excellent job balancing all three and an amazing grab while in Ok 858 charactersSavvyStudent, Sep 21, 2013

Overall a decent imperial stout but I would recommend letting her sit for awhile before opening another . It would be interesting to collect a few different batches and so a side by side to see if anything changes. Just a thought .

S - aroma is deep and inviting. grindy roasty coffee 
Comes at the nose with full force while notes of chili spice and pepper skins tingle the nostrils. Cocoa nibs present as a dark bittersweet chocolate sauce.
T - very balanced up front. Notes of chocolate and doughy bread with a creeping chili pepper heat. Peppers do dominate but play nice with the chocolatey sweetness as dusty coffee notes cut through slightly. Faint vanilla flavors on the backed. Finish is pepper dominate with notes of chocolate, coffee and booze to round it off.
M - medium high mouthfeel. Creamy texture. High carb.
O - great beer. A bit heavy on the pepper which does effect the overall balance/complexity factor. But i love chili peppers so i thought it was quite well done. 871 charactersTeleweizen2, Sep 17, 2013

4.47/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.512oz bottle, from the recent 2013 vintage with red wax. Shared with Doug today on our One Ear Anniversary tasting, today 9/14/2013. Poured into a Cantillon wine glass.
Okay so this pours an above average imperial stout. Pours a pitch black body with an awesome creamy mocha head that gets to about 1cm, with solid retention. Not the greatest lacing, but you can tell this is a good imperial stout here. But not much more.
The smell on this one is straight up coffee. Which makes sense because this is fresh. This made us decide to open up a bottle of fresh Founders' Breakfast Stout, which smelled like straight up water next to this one. This is when we knew this was a serious smelling beer. Lots of sweet underlying roast malt combined with the bitter dark chocolate flavours and bitter black coffee flavours. Very good. 
OK, the flavour on this is truly outstanding. You'd think this was a coffee bomb, but on top of all the intense black coffee acidity, there is an awesome dark chocolate bitterness mixed in with a sweet vanilla presence that really complements the coffee. What's even more outstanding is after about 4-5 sips into this beer, we got this awesome spiciness that gave a great heat on the aftertaste. This is truly a complex beer with so much flavours that I can't make sense of it... the only thing missing is some cinnamon. 
Mouthfeel is just thick, creamy and decently carbonated. I would say that the only beer that supersedes this one is Hunahpu, but that's because Cigar City is the king of full bodied, thick and oily imperial stouts. This beer is just so drinkable, we could not tell it was 14%. Yet, it was so thick and so flavourful. This is up there with Hunahpu, and it certainly beats Mexican Cake and edges out Abraxas.. but not for the lack of cinnamon.
Not going to lie, I had relatively low expectations for Bomb compared to the others of its style. Perhaps because its brewed in Oklahoma. This is basically Ballast Point Victory At Sea with a ton of peppery spiciness and a better mouthfeel. Prairie is one of these breweries that is going to be a serious player in the craft beer world from here on. Bomb, Hop, 'Merica- everything I've had from them so far indicates an excellent attention to detail and high quality... unlike the Oklahoma Sooners. Sorry guys, your beer is just that good. 2,333 charactersStevedore, Sep 15, 2013

4.18/5  rDev -6.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25On tap at Small Bar, chicago.
Pretty dark place, but it appeared pretty pitch black with a little head that dissipated rather quickly.
Smells of coffee, chocolate. Mostly roasted coffee.
Tastes of coffee, nice heat from the chili. I initially thought of End of Days, but more complex and palatable. Not as sweet, but just sweet enough. Somewhat like Abraxas, but not as chocolately.
Mouthfeel is about medium, not as chewy as I like my brews, but enough to be rather enjoyable with mild carbonation.
Overall, I enjoyed this brew very much. The chili is present, not overwhelming, but just right. Could use a little more cocoa nib presence. A BA version would be interesting. Oh, and the 14% alcohol? This has 14%? You gotta be kidding me. I don't taste it at all!! I did feel it though... haha 798 characters4amepiphany, Sep 14, 2013

Smells of espresso. Cocao. A bit of spice appears as well. Vanilla. No aspect over powers. Balanced and delicious.
Tastes really big on the bitter cocoa and coffee. Smoky mild, earthy peppers with very mild heat that compliments the beer nicely. Vanilla sweetness. 
Lower carb nice feel. Big compliments for virtually no alcohol. Full mouthfeel. Coats the mouth nicely.
Edit: Initial review was on the red wax. After drinking the pink wax In had to increase a couple categories as it was even a better beer. Wow. Thicker mouthfeel and just bolder all around. Bigger nose and tastes all without one aspect overpowering. Just amazing! 782 charactersPowderhornphil, Sep 14, 2013

The spicy chilies come through up front with bittersweet chocolate and espresso. A hint of oak, but so much more cocoa and more chili than I expected. I bit of paprika and some cocoa. Taste is dark chocolate up front. It quickly turns to rich chocolate fudge and dark chocolate. The chili peppers come through quickly after and balance out the rich chocolate. This beer tastes like chocolate cake with chocolate frosting, with jalapeno sprinkles on it. So damn tasty! Drinkability is scary high. Overall, possibly the best chili stout I've ever had. The high ABV is well-masked. Such a unique and special beer that I'm happy I have more of. 754 charactersDovaliHops, Sep 13, 2013
4.47/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.512oz red waxed bottle poured into a Cigar City snifter.
A - Pours oily thick into the glass and sits with a super deep brown color that approaches black...nearly totally opaque. A half finger of foamy cappuccino head sits on top for a brief time, falling slowly to a skim coat on surface with a thick foamy collar around the edge of the glass.
S - Rich coffee, thick on the nose up front. Smooth semi-sweet vanilla, warm boozy alcohol on every inhale, cocoa powder, Hershey's syrup, milk chocolate, fudge brownies, light chili pepper that gives a bit of a bite that complements the coffee nicely. This really smells great.
T - Sweet milky chocolate up front gives the first impression. This is quickly followed by dark roasted black coffee, a touch of acrid astringency. Then comes the chocolate - semi-sweet, and bitter chocolates, fudge and more coffee. On the finish comes the chili pepper - nicely sharp but still somehow subtle pepper to complement the prior flavors and slowly developing into a nice warm pepper heat that lingers past the swallow. Superb!
M - Thick, full body. Carbonation is on the lower side and gives a super smooth and creamy texture. Oily and a touch slick. Lots of nuance here with flavors that change from sip to sip. I notice lots of variety on the exhale - one time it is filled with vanilla, the next pepper, the next coffee and chocolate. Alcohol is scarily unnoticeable...can't believe this is 14%.
O - Outstanding! I came into to this with high hopes and a bit of skepticism. Everybody is coming out with their version of the cocoa, coffee, vanilla, chili (and usually cinnamon) imperial stout...always sounds outstanding, but the execution of these stouts have been hit or miss to me. I was finding it a little hard to believe that this could be as good as people have been saying. In actuality, I think it might be even better than people are saying. Tons of flavor - lot of nuance. Everything seems to work together quite well, even with so much going on. I wasn't particularly impressed by the appearance, but everything else was outstanding. This is a super imperial stout. Definitely will be looking for more of this. 2,164 charactersportia99, Sep 13, 2013

A: Pitch, pitch, pitch black pour. Very large, very dense, very dark brown head. Head fades very very slowly, leaving quite heavy lacing behind. Great retention. 
S: Big big coffee aroma. Huge roasted coffee beans, quality beans at that. Lots of cocoa adds a mocha-like effect. Just a hint of sting from the chili peppers but barely. Really nice sharp, bold aroma. 
T: Again with the big roasted coffee bean but not AS overpowering as the aroma. A little smoother here too, not as sharp. Still pretty much dominates. Mild bittersweet chocolate mixes with the coffee and stands alone in the middle. Just a brief hint of chili pepper in the aftertaste but it's obliterated by everything else. Lingering mild chili pepper and bitter mocha between sips. Zero sign of alcohol especially for the 14%.
M: Heavy and thick and slightly astringent. 
O: A beer with so much potential but didn't quite reach it. No sign of vanilla and barely any sign of the chili peppers. This is basically a big and wonderful coffee stout with a little chocolate to back it up. If I didn't know it had vanilla and chili beans I doubt I ever would have picked it up. The coffee pretty much dominates the whole brew BUT it is delicious coffee so how can I really complain? I had just hyped it up as more, if I'm honest. One of the times where hypes detracts from the experience, unfortunately. Don't get me wrong, fantastic coffee stout regardless. With just a litttle bit of heat. Super easy drinking for 14% with no sign of booze. 1,606 charactersDope, Sep 12, 2013

4.56/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5A - Bomb! pours viscous and dark, with a full frothy mocha head present. An outer layer of lacing is present when the glass is tipped. The carbonation present is fizzy and dissipating
S - the chocolate roast is ever-present, with dark coffee, malt, and plenty of ground coffee beans noted up front; the ancho chili peppers are definitely there in the nose, with the barely-there vanilla present too; probably one of the more complex noses on a beer I've encountered
T - of the coffee/cacao/vanilla/ancho combo announced on the label, this beer is tremendously coffee-forward. The ancho chili pepper flavors really come through and as this beer warms a bit, so do you. That ancho flavor hits the back of your throat nicely and you can really taste it in your burps. The vanilla is mostly present as the sticky lingering flavor on your lips and seems somewhat overpowered by the coffee and ancho. The sugar and cream of a training-wheels coffee is dominant too. Bitter chocolate and coffee beans galore
M - ultimately, Bomb! is really easy to drink; it goes down way smoother than you might think a 14% imperial stout, with all the flavors and dark roasty goodness, should. The carbonation levels make for a smooth drink, and that 14% is masked almost perfectly by all the flavors going on. Dangerously drinkable. 
O - I didn't do much to acquire this bottle, so it had nowhere to go but up. I realize it's one of those 'it' attainable beers right now, but it pretty much lives up to the hype. I see the comparisons to Huna, and they're warranted. Huna may have this slightly beat, however. That said, Bomb! is really good shit and brings the coffee flavors to the table. I'm pleased with the complexity and drinkability and wouldn't for the life of me, if I hadn't known, guess this was a 14% beer. 1,801 charactersSkeeterBoganski, Sep 12, 2013

Appearance: Pours an extremely dark brown/black and leaves a nice one-finger deep brown head. Extremely attractive imperial stout.
Smell: Huge coffee notes along with dark chocolate, figs, raisins, caramel, vanilla, malts, and some chili pepper spice at the end. Massive complex aroma, very pleasant.
Taste: Definitely dominated by the coffee, but there is also some figs, roasted malts, and vanilla upfront with it. A good balance between bitter and sweet - very interesting. A hint of chili spice at the end, but it is light and balanced. Alcohol is expertly masked by all the flavors.
Mouth-feel: Nice thick body with a good amount of carbonation. I wouldn't exactly call this creamy because of all the carbonation, but it definitely has a nice feel. Smooth finish.
Overall: This bomb has lots of flavor, especially coffee flavor, and it combines that with a nice heavy body. The alcohol is amazingly hidden. From the smell, I was hoping for a little more chocolate, vanilla and pepper in the flavor but it is still very nice, especially if you are a coffee lover. 1,142 charactersResuin, Sep 10, 2013

Nose is vanilla forward paired with strong espresso and cacao. Smells bold and rich, not much pepper in the nose. Taste is smooth with heavy coffee and roast followed by a strong presence of vanilla which mellows the intensity of the roast. Right at the finish is when some heat begins and puts an exclamation on all the flavor. Delicious. Mouthfeel is thick and smooth wih mild carbonation. Overall, this draft version blows the bottled version I recently had out of the water. The bottle seemed thin, earthy, and forgettable whereas this glass pops with delicious flavors. 666 charactershomebrew311, Sep 10, 2013

I have had this beer from the bottle and from the tap. Each had a slightly different taste, but were just as good overall. Consumed from a snifter both times. 2013 vintage in both cases.
A - Dark, with a decent leathery head despite the 14% ABV. Refused to stick to the side of the glass when swirled. By the appearance, I did not expect what was coming next...
S - What is that? Freshly melted chocolate? Espresso grounds? A little sugar and cream. This smell is just short of euphoric. There it is! The alcohol. It took a minute to smell, but I spotted it.
T - Both the tap and bottle had chocolate syrup, coffee, vanilla. Slightly flowery and fruity. This is where the tap and bottle vary: almost no spice in the initial taste with the bottle, but it comes at the end and stays with you for a minute after you're done drinking; on tap, the spice is present from beginning to end. A bit of artisanal gourmet bacon-chili chocolate bar on the tongue. Incredibly easy to drink for 14%. Bourbon wood is present, but not obvious or overwhelming. This is how a chocolate vanilla imperial stout should taste.
M - Does not weigh down my tongue. Sticks in the mouth, like it does in the glass - leaves it coatless. Smooth swallow with well hidden ABV. No sting in this one.
O - My new favorite Stout. Sets the bar for all future stouts that I taste. Not enough to make other good stouts seem bad in comparison - just at the top of the game. I can't wait to find more of this in San Francisco. Big shout out to Øl in Walnut Creek for having this wonderful beer on tap. 1,672 charactersSwongler, Sep 10, 2013

A - Pours a nice rich dark brown nearly black hue with a very nice one finger mocha head that simply does NOT go away. Nice creamy side lacing and a creamy blanket. Excellent retention. 
S - Chili's are first and foremost here with some earthy smokey ancho chili goodness. Wonder what chili's they used...they actually overpower the coffee. I get nice chocolate and a lot of vanilla. Wish there was more coffee here but the prominent chili and vanilla make up for it.
T - Ah..okay, this is nice. First sip brings a smile to my lips. Lots of chocolate and earthy smoke to start, light sweetness, super delicious vanilla. The ancho chili lingers on the finish along with super, super faint bitter roast coffee. Nice dark bakers chocolate, sweet vanilla pods, getting no alcohol at all with this one. Delicious.
M - Mouthfeel is very, very nice for the style. Alcohol hidden wonderfully, very light carbonation. Would like it a bit more 'velvety' but yeah, well done. 
O - Overall, this beer has been getting a TON of attention. I was very skeptical, but man oh man is this good. Its damn good, and that's without tossing this in a bourbon barrel! The faint (for me at least) lingering smoky ancho chili heat and vanilla wins this one for me. Very, very well done. 1,332 charactersrudzud, Sep 06, 2013

Wasn't sure what to think of it based on the name but my friend recommended it and I was not disappointed. It pours like a dark syrup with very little foam. The best way for me to describe this is like drinking a tootsie roll. It has the sweet chocolate flavor while providing a small hint of coffee. As the beer warms, the chili flavor comes through and sits on your tongue. Overall, one of my top 5 beers. 483 charactersAZBeerDude, Sep 02, 2013

You know you're conflicted when you want to drop this bottle (due to the name), but you also know that doing so would waste a potentially great beer. ... Anyway, this stuff pours a very dark black-brown topped by a finger of tan foam. The nose comprises dark and lightly-acrid coffee, vanilla bean, light oak, and a good helping of earthy greens. The taste holds notes of earthy coffee, roasted malts, and light dark chocolate powder. The body is a hefty-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, I don't get the love professed for this beer. It's fairly boring in terms of spiced-stout characteristics, and the peppers are really nowhere to be seen (save in adding some green earthiness to the proceedings). No real complexity is to be found. Nothing about this beer brings much in the way of comparisons to Hunahpu (which I'm not even the biggest fanboy of) and its ilk. I mean, it's not a bad beer, in all honesty, but it's nowhere near as good as I've been hearing. I just don't get it... 1,060 charactersTMoney2591, Sep 02, 2013

Maybe a small bit if surface coating, but not much. Aroma is mostly coffee. Darkly roasted malts, and some earthy chiles, but little else. Taste is disappointing: lots of dirty earth, some earthy chile, coffee dregs. Little sweetness. Full bodied. Lower carbonation. Dirty feeling. 
Not exactly sure how this beer is getting the hype it's pulling. I found it to be very simplistic and Dirty. Coincidentally I had this right after East End Coffee Porter and while East Ends beer wasn't overly impressive neither was the Prairie. Comparisons to Hunaphu's is unjust. 643 charactersFlorida9, Sep 02, 2013

Complex flavors from both the base beer and from additions, and then its roasted drinkability allows these guys to look like old pros!
As expected, the beer is black. Just shy of any mirror-like sheen, the beer seems to have a hazy density that's exacerbated by its absolute darkness. But then the beer takes on lightened proportions as a billowing mocha-stained column rises to match the rim of the snifter. Boldly carbonated, the beer easily retains the session with a thick creme of foam and laces with reliable concentric rings with each sip.
Incredibly roasty in aroma, the beer is spot on espresso and roasted walnuts. Sprinkled with a sense of cocoa powder and burnt molasses- the roasted grains are well supported with a more supple and sweeter counterpart. As the alcohols rise, it carries with it a hint of whisky, smoke, charred fruit but no real sign of the chili peppers that's promised.
One sip and it inflates the mouth with dry roastiness. Bitter espresso, cocoa, walnuts and scorched sugars all round into a lighter than expected burnt flavor. Its sweetness is supportive but doesn't steal the show. The middle palate introduces a fruitier tone with alcohol-soaked fruits: cherries, blackcurrant, raisins and a touch of licorice spice become the vehicle for its whisky-type alcohol. Reading into the beer a little, there's a slim fruit-vegetable tone that could be chili, but could also be hop and alcohol.
Undoubtedly full bodied, the ale is both cream-ied up by its expansive carbonation and also lightened by it. The bubbles seem to make the beer float just above the tongue with a semi-arid dryness and powdery roast character. By the time that the carbonation subsides, the sweetness has already faded and the spicy warmth of alcohol and capsacin linger boldly on the throat.
Prairie has absolutely knocked this one out of the park. Each sip delivers a new flavor, a new experience, and new complexion to the beer. I'm happy to see it being considered in the upper echelon of stouts because it rightfully belongs there. 2,219 charactersBEERchitect, Aug 27, 2013

Score: 96
Spring 2013 vintage bottle (gold wax, batch 1) served in an Upland snifter glass and enjoyed on 08/24/13 to celebrate the end of this year's wedding season.
Appearance: Ink black in color. No light penetrates through when held up to light. Pours just under a finger of brownish tan head that settles to a thin coating layer. Excellent lacing and retention. 4.75/5
Smell: Tons of roast and coffee. Then chocolate and doughy vanilla cake batter. Subtle notes of peppers, but the pepper character is not very prominent at all. Really lovely integration of the coffee/chocolate/vanilla characters here. Smells like an awesome cake batter mixed with roasted coffee. 4.75/5
Taste: Bitter, roasty coffee hit the tongue first, then cacao, tongue-pricking peppers and a hint of vanilla, followed by residual chocolate bitterness, a little roast and residual peppery liveliness. The flavor is not cake-like at all, and the degrees of chocolate, coffee, vanilla and pepper are in different proportion than in the nose. The peppers are substantially more prominent, and the vanilla is really dialed down. There is also less roasty coffee on the palate than I expected given how forward this character was in the nose. There is a little vegetal pepper flavor in the finish at first, but this disappears as the beer warms up and breathes. 4.5/5
Mouthfeel: Full bodied, low carbonation. Has a nice pepper spiciness without being a mouth/throat burner; even Scott Nicholas could handle this one (hi Scott). Well balanced between the bitter/sweet/spicy, lending itself to a high degree of drinkability here. 4.5/5
Overall: An excellent brew from an up-and-coming craft brewery located in a state you would not a expect a beer of this quality to originate from. I love how the nose and taste feature the same qualities, but each is different and enticing in their own way. Highly recommend this one.
Cost: $7.99 for a 12 oz bottle. 2,105 charactersjegross2, Aug 25, 2013

The smell is straight forward chocolate , almost like opening up a chocolate bar and taking a big whiff ,the coffee is faint for me but it is there lurking in the back. Very nice
Thick and heavy on the tongue , goes down nice and smooth , very filling
The flavor is knock your socks off good , would never guess this thing is 14% at all , the alcohol is hidden very well in this. Picking up on chocolate and super rich malty flavor with slight hints of coffee then the peppers kick in for the aftertaste and leave a slight burn on the tongue and the back of the throat

A - Tan foam settles to a partial cap, thick collar, and specks of lace. Black body with a touch of lighter brown at the edges of the glass.
S - Huge roast, coffee, spicy chiles, vanilla, milled grains, semisweet chocolate, and no perceptible alcohol. Great balance and depth - pretty awesome.
T - The taste isn't quite as heavy on the chiles, but it's still quite enjoyable. Roasted malts, vanilla, cocoa, touch of coffee, and extremely well-hidden booze. Some chile spice and peppery notes late on the palate. Quite decadent.
M - Medium-full body, chewy, creamy, and soft texture, with lower carbonation. There's some heat, but I'm guessing it's from the chiles rather than the alcohol.
D - This is awesome stuff. Looking forward to grabbing a few bottles as well as the inevitable barrel-aged version(s). Really impressed and totally up my alley in the chile-stout flavor balance. Might be tough for me to drink mass quantities, but I'd love to try. 1,020 charactersMasterSki, Aug 20, 2013

Imperial Stout 
14% ABV
Appearance - Darker than black. Take your normal black and then bold it. Thin dark khaki head.
Smell - Roasted cocoa with some vanilla to help balance the alcohol.
Taste - Sheer perfection! The chili works to activate your taste buds, which then receive the ccocoa, vanilla, and roasted espresso. The alcohol is prevalent, but works perfectly to balance the explosion of flavor. If there is a better stout available, I haven't found it. Prairie Bomb is destroying all competition with this product.
Mouthfeel - Extremely thick and creamy (even for an imperial stout).
This is my favorite beer on the planet. It's a must find for every stout connoisseur. 718 characterscapnamerica, Aug 18, 2013

Pours black, effervescent carbonation begins its work whipping up a frothy dense cap about 1" thick; reminds me of a soy latte poured into a pint glass. Smell is mild coffee, slight pepper, anise, and the darkest chocolate one can find in the store, I'm talking 90%+ cacao. Taste is coffee and chocolate, with a warming pepper burn at the back; the black roast lends a tannic quality that balances what sweetness would be expected from a 14% stout. Man, that pepper burn is sticking- I don't think it is alcohol, this is a lingering, smoldering salsa type burn. The dark chocolate is truly prominent in the flavor profile on this. Mouthfeel is thick without being cloying, the carbonation is fine and works to make this beast more quaffable. I approve of this beer. 797 charactersyouradhere, Aug 16, 2013

4.43/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I decided to have a little fun with this one as I tried it side by side with KBS. While both are quite different, I wanted to see how these 2 powerhouse breakfast stouts stacked up to one another.
A- Extremely dark brown with the faintest bit of lighter accents appearing from the trace of light coming through. A wisp of a caramel colored head that leaves a ring around the glass the whole drink. Wonderful lacing for the abv.
S- Coffee beans galore and a significant dose of vanilla as well, but what really stands out to me is the peppers that take over the nose. It gives a chili pepper note that I am not accustomed to in the normal stout aroma. But rather than being distracting, it is quite inviting.
T- Oh my! A unique combination of sweet chocolate, vanilla beans, roasted coffee, damp wood, caramel and chili peppers. Complex, smooth, roasted, spicy, yet balanced. Unlike any breakfast stout i have ever tried. Simply magnificent! Waves of layers.
M- Creamy, full flavored, but the lightness of this beer makes it so much more drinkable than you would expect for the style and abv. Just a touch of warmth (probably more from the peppers), but virtually no detection of alcohol booze. Delicate, yet wonderful carbonation. Flows over the tongue like a sheet of velvet. 
O- This is certainly a "Wow" beer in my book. It made me sit up in my seat and do a double take. One of those beers that makes you say "holy crap!...did I just taste what I thought I tasted? (gulp) Yeah, I most certainly did." Seems to fit my palate perfectly with the spice, bakers chocolate, roasted vanilla and coffee beans. Sad that I only bought 2. I will age the other bottle as long as i can, but it will inevitably be shorter than I would like. As I compare side by side, I will say different, but better than KBS. To each his/her own though.

A - Pours coal black with a full finger of mocha head. The frothy head lasts for a while and leaves a spotty lacing upon its retreat. 
S - Smells like Hershey's chocolate world. Rich, sweet, creamy chocolate with a big dose of vanilla. Just the lightest bit of cayenne along with a some toasted malts. One fo the best smelling beers I have ever come across, hands down. Amazing. 
T - Big chocolate notes to start, although I would classify it closer to dark chocolate than the milk chocolate I got in the nose. Sweetens considerably as it warms and the vanilla starts to shine through. A touch of heat on the finish, but I'm not sure if its due to the chili peppers or the 14% ABV. Complex and intensely flavored. Delicious. 
M - Full bodied with mild carbonation. Smooth with just a bit of lingering heat. 
O - I was stoked when I saw this on the shelf at my favorite neighborhood beer store. I had never seen it before and jumped at the chance to try it. I am so glad I did. I very rarely give otu a 5 in a category, but it is hard for me to imagine a finer smelling beer. The flavor does not disappoint with a powerful blend of chocolate and vanilla bean with mild pepper heat. It's hard for me to believe this beer is 14% because it was gone before I knew it. I appreciate the 12 oz. size as well. Grab this beer if you see it. Among the best stouts, no...beers, I have ever had. 1,484 charactersNoLeafClover44, Aug 05, 2013
4.44/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Bottle thanks to the trade master, Dak. Pours a deep black with small dark brown head in my Hunapuh glass. Aroma is big bittersweet chocolate, vanilla, bitter coffee, and big time peppers. Much more pepper presence than Hunapuh here. Smells rich and creamy until the pepper bite comes through. Silky mouthfeel with lowish carbonation. Super huge chocolate here with a perfect bite from the pepper that blends seamlessly with the earthy coffee. Decedent for sure. Not sure where the vanilla comes into the flavor but it doesn't matter. It is good anyway. No trace of the huge ABV on this one. A great dessert tonight after my steak. 631 charactersBMMillsy, Aug 05, 2013

5/5  rDev +11.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Says its aged on coffee, cacao nibs, vanilla beans and chili peppers...Awesome, each one of these flavors is evident and perfectly balanced with the others. Nothing too overpowering, and nothing dominates. It all blends together magnificently! 
Eye: This one is perfect and again, I can't ask for more. Thick black body with a one finger head that sticks around-color of the head is mud brown and is creamy. It looks very very inviting. Lacing is thick and beautiful.
Nose: Awesome is the first word I can find. Imperial stout, chocolate, coffee, faint chili peppers and vanilla as well. This one has everything the label states and they are not at all hard to find. None of them stick out above the other, rather they are all blended in here real nice and knowing what I'm looking for, they are easy to find. 
Tongue: Just amazing. Upon the finish a little heat/spice from the peppers is noticeable. Vanilla is there to to give it depth in the finish. Aftertaste is amazing. Coffee and chocolate are evident, slight warmth from alcohol...or is it the heat from the peppers? Either way all these flavors work extremely well together in this beer. They all add huge depths of flavor to this Imperial Stout. This beer is an abyss of complexity and flavor. Real wow factor here. Just an amazing beer. I really wish I had and could get more of this...right now! Body is full and carbonation is low and according to style. I just can't believe how well everything blends together in this beer to create a very impressive and unique beer. I've not had anything like this before each flavor is here supporting the others and they all play so well off each other.
Drinkability: Seek this beer out! It is a must try! One of the best beers I've had, ever! I wish its availability were much better than it currently is but if you find this try it! A wow factor beer for me! They really, really, in every aspect don't get better. Top of the charts here.
I mean compared to every single imperial stout I've ever had, they are all child"s play compared to this one. Seriously. 2,067 charactersbecktone, Jul 28, 2013

A: Thick motor oil-like pour into the glass. Caramel/tan colored head sits atop, less than one finger in height. Lots of thick patchy lacing and the retention cap stays around for the whole consumption.
S: At first this beer was too cold but once it warmed it really opened up. Plenty of roasted coffee beans, sweet vanilla, chocolate and just a faint notion of chili flesh towards the back.
T: Loads of coffee and chocolate up front. The chili started to become more pronounced as this warmed and left some minor tingling down the throat. Vanilla notes dance on the back of the palate with some roasted malts.
M: Hands down, and without question, the best mouth feel I've ever felt on an Imperial Stout. It's so thick and smooth, it almost feels like a milkshake. Amazing stuff.
This beer not only lived up to its hype and expectations but exceeded it in some areas for me. This drinks nothing like 14% ABV. Dangerously drinkable and amazingly delicious. I'm seeking out more right now. 1,120 charactersShanePB, Jul 16, 2013

4.8/5  rDev +7.1%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Received a gigantic box of Prairie last week, but I’ve been too busy with my serious drinking to bother with thoughtful drinking and so I haven’t had a chance to write about it. But now my work is done and I don’t got to be no where for 15 hours, so let’s open up one of these bastards.
Bomb is the most coveted Prairie, and so I’ll go with that first. It’s part of this new trend wherein high-ABV imperials are aged on peppers and chocolate, because chocolate covered peppers are just everyone’s favorite treat. It smells…like chocolate and peppers. But also crisp and manicured, like the fragrance of one of those brightly lit mall stores where they overpriced kitchen equipment. It’s clean, but a very specific, very dirty sort of clean.
Tastes like a new, perfect thing. I’ve had high-ABV chipotle stouts before, but this… this is different. The peppers dominate and are mellowed by the chocolate. So instead of getting a coffe-based RIS or a hoppy RIS or a vinous RIS, you get acidic, spicy peppers up front and smooth milky chocolate in the back. The former plays alongside the ethanol nodes, the latter buffets the barley. Also—what I realize after sipping it is that the cleanliness I detected in the aroma was the sharpness of the peppers interacting with the zippiness of the booze, which resulting in a dull-sharp peng of pleasant sterility akin to the rubbing alcohol swab doctors use before making injections.
Fucked up and damn near perfect.

Bottle into a snifter. 
A: Black, very black, with a formidable dark brown head and awesome retention. Lots of lacing. Great looking beer.
S: Lots of chocolate and vanilla bean with light coffee notes. Chili pepper is well integrated, accompanying roasted grains and a little brown sugar. Vanilla stands out most. Could do with a stronger coffee influence.
T: Big vanilla notes blending with spicy chili pepper and dark chocolate. Subdued coffee (I wish this was stronger). Some astringency is evident. Molasses and a robust roasted malt body. Light chili pepper heat in the vanilla cocoa finish.
M: Full body with upper medium carbonation. The mouthfeel is chewy, sticky, and thick. 
Overall: An enjoyable beer. Could do with a stronger coffee presence but still quite nice. I look forward to trying more offerings from this brewery. 851 charactersHopHead84, Jul 12, 2013
4.66/5  rDev +4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 5A- Very dark with a lacey brown/ almost redish head.
S- Hints of chocolate, heavy coffee, vanilla, and hits of ancho chilie. 
T- When I swirl it around in my mouth, it drops Bombs of chocolate and coffee. The 
 hints of vanilla and chilies balance out this stout.
M- The most notable aspect, is that it is very light for an imperial stout. I really 
 enjoyed the lightness in contrast to the really heavy stouts that have to be chewed 
 through. 
O- This beer can be enjoyed over and over with something new almost every time. For
 me, this stout changes what I have come to expect from stouts. The slight chilie on
 the end seems to say "I know you will be back". The perfect amount that leaves you 
 wondering how it got past you, to only say goodbye. 757 charactersBOOYAH, Jul 11, 2013

M: Very smooth. Despite its dark stout look I think the mouthfeel is lighter. This is not a heavy beer.
O: Excellent. I have to be in the mood for stouts but I can see myself drink this at any opportunity. 512 charactersmpcrump, Jul 09, 2013

Prairie Bomb pours a midnight black in color with maybe a quarter inch of dark mocha lacing. The pour was a little light in body for an imperial stout, especially for a beer of 14%. The nose features a healthy dose of cocoa, coffee, and vanilla yet they all team together to provide a soft and delicate dessert of a nose. The pepper is subtle. The flavors are smooth and chocolaty with a nice level of vanilla. The coffee is present but takes a backseat. The pepper is present more in the aftertaste than anywhere else and it does have the ability to linger for a few minutes, which is welcome. It's a nice amount of pepper. There could be more but it does possess more spice than most. It drinks light for the style and really doesn't give any indication of being 14%. This is an impressive beer, especially for the price. I'd compare it to a lighter version of Hunahpu, but with coffee. 992 charactersaasher, Jul 06, 2013

Typical stout, black with 1 finger cola head some blotches.
Lots going on in the aroma. Huge coffee, then peppers, vanilla, chocolate
Chocolate and coffee, vanilla and peppers with slight heat that follows.

A: dark, cannot see through. A minimal amount of head and almost no lacing.
S: Excellent, all the notes described on the bottle have their shine. But mainly a chocolate note with a hint of vanilla.
T: Awesome, the chills are very prominent but subdued by the chocolate and vanilla. Spiciness first followed by the cocoa and vanilla. Very well balanced as all notes participate. I do detect a little of the 14% alcohol.
M: Sticky somewhat. Little carbonation and a whole lot of flavor. 
O: An superb brew that if you like the more malty dark spectrum of beers I will encourage you to try. All notes are balanced and the beer is heavy but not like cutting butter. At 14% and no detection this is a desert beer. An excellent choice that I encourage you to buy. 808 charactersfishdog, Jun 29, 2013

A - Pours a dark chocolate, not too thick, nice two finger coffee head and nice lacing throughout as I drink the beer. Great looking stout. 
S - Amazing, coffee, bittersweet chocolate, vanilla, chili, it is all there. Each note struggles to jump out and with such strong notes, the balance of the nose is incredible. Nothing to fault here. 
T - Chocolate and Vanilla flavored coffee, with a hint of chili on the tongue. A nice sweetness up front but not even close to cloying. The flavors all meld well, not going to get much better than this. 
M - Smooth, not too viscous - perhaps a bit too thin for a big stout like this but not going to take too many points off for that. 
 O - What a wonderful beer. I had thought that Mexican Cake was about as good as it could get with a non-BA stout for me, but this beer has it all. The flavors are blended with skill, it is not boozy for the ABV, and the heat is toned down here, the chili is there just to tie everything else in. Superb. 1,107 charactersnesarebad, Jun 28, 2013

Big coffee to the nose; and not the cutesy kind with the caramel and whip cream BS, but a real man's coffee out of a tin cup by a campfire after you've been on the trail for days. Some roasted nuts are smelled along with a dose of milk chocolate, faint vanilla, burnt oak and earthy hops. Straight forward, right on, and no messing around. 
Tastes of creamy milk chocolate up front with a wallop of smoldering oak followed by an expected, but no less welcome fusel alcohol. Some black licorice and singed sugar notes are laced with some peppery heat at the very back. This one is Kicking the Pricks on all fronts so far.
Goes down close to heavy and viscous as 'literal' fuck. The heat is on without a doubt, but it's finessed so well by the other dancers at this party that you barely notice. 
Prairie Bomb is a hot, in-yer-face mess that you can't let go of no matter how wild she gets. 987 charactersstephens101, Jun 25, 2013

4.56/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Pours black with a relatively dark brown head. Little to no lacing. Not much in the way of head retention but it's easy to kick up more foam. The aroma is big on vanilla, chocolate and coffee. More of the chili comes out as the beer warms. Fairly sweet aroma but nothing comes across artificially. The taste starts out with a bunch of vanilla and chocolate. Coffee and roast come right behind. Rather sweet but there's enough flavor bouncing around that it doesn't dominate. Mild but noticeable chili burn in the finish. It adds a welcome layer of complexity to the beer. Things would probably get a bit too sweet without that little burn. Nice thick mouthfeel. Very smooth and full. This is an excellent imperial stout. There's lots of flavor and it all plays well together. Great work from Prairie. 800 characterspopery, Jun 24, 2013

A- oil-dark with trace of caramel head. I gave an aggressive poor, but still less than a pinky finger. Foam color is gorgeous though. 
S- similar to KBS. Lots a coffee and burnt sugar, with some dark chocolate. 
T- light chili spice right away, but no burn. Then the coffee/chocolate takes over. As it warms, you feel more of the spice in the back of your mouth and the roasted/smokey notes come out. I love the chili in this. 
M- lightest carb at first, but fades quickly to fairly typical barrel aged stout. Not sure I was floored by the mouthfeel. 
O- add this to my Always Want list. It really is top notch. I was disappointed in the 2013 Hunahpu's that I had, because it lacked any measurable heat or spice flavor to my palate. Prairie Bomb does not suffer the same problem. This had high expectations based upon the buzz and reviews, and it surpassed all hope. 1,077 charactersIAmJacksHopTongue, Jun 23, 2013

A: Pours dark black color with a thick dark tan head forming on the pour. it recedes to a thick collar and thin film that leaves a sticky webbing of lace down the glass.
S: Wow. Absolutely delicious. Lots of sweet cinnamon, milk chocolate and fresh ground coffee beans. Sweet vanilla as well with some very light pepper on the back end. Mild roasted malts throughout, but the adjuncts really make up the bulk of the nose.
T: Unfortunately, the taste doesn't quite live up to the deliciousness of the nose, but it's still very good. The vanilla is slightly artificial, but the coffee and cocoa nibs mask it mostly. The peppery qualities come through a lot more in the taste with some fleshy heat. Roasted malts with some light bitter bakers chocolate. The booze is non-existent on this guy. Extremely well hidden.
M: Heavier mouthfeel with a thick and chewy texture. The carbonation is medium with a sweet, roasted and slightly spicy finish.
O: Outstanding work from Prairie. This is the real deal and I'm so glad I've got a three left from the trade. The booze is extremely well hidden and the mouthfeel is spot on for the style. Will have again soon. 1,295 charactersTreebs, Jun 20, 2013

Smell - Lots of chocolate. Some cinnamon. Coffee is secondary, or tertiaty I guess. Peppers on the back end.
Taste - Very chocolatey. Coffee is more prominent, but blends into the chocolate. The pepper flavor peaks out at the beginning but builds up throughout. A bit of spiciness in the finish.
Mouthfeel - Really doesn't taste like 14%. Medium heavy body. Prett chewy. Medium low carbonation. 
Overall - Impressive. Great flavors and enough of a stout to stand up to them. Bourbon barrel please? Yumm. 657 charactersAlieniloquium, Jun 18, 2013

Pours an effervescent pitch black with a fast falling mocha colored head. Nice viscious look, near zero head retention & lacing 
S: Rich coffee & dark chocolate, caramel & vanilla
T: Follows the, vanilla, caramel & a general hint of creme brule' going on here along with dryness, just a little chille bite too. More pepper heat as this warms, coffee, mocha & oaky notes, strong caramel. Finishes with oaky dryness, chille heat, coffee & cocoa
MF: Medium bodied, fairly silky, thickens up over time
This is incredibily smooth & drinkable for such a complex beer. Deft use of chillles really sets this apart from the crowd. Easily my favorite big beer from Prairie, so far... Wanted to wring the bottle out to get every drop. I would love to see a barrel aged version of this, but pretty awesome in its own right 890 charactersrusspowell, Jun 16, 2013

4.88/5  rDev +8.9%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75First of 6 bottles purchased. Poured into a St. Bernardus Waton glass.
Appearance: Pitch black motor oil with a thin mocha head that dosnt stay for long (unsurprisingly at 14% abv).
Smell: Man this smells incredible. Roasted coffee, vanilla, hints of chocolate, and a little twinge of spice.
Taste: Dark roasted coffee and vanilla upfront. The chocolate comes in strong in the middle and the spice from the chili peppers dosnt make its appearance until the very back of the tongue on the swallow. You actually get the feeling in your throat as if you just ate a jalepeno.
Mouthfeel: Thick and creamy. Perfect for this style and perfect for the flavor profile. The spicy, tingly feeling in the throat is also extremely enjoyable (i love spicy).
Overall: There is quite a bit of hype surrounding this beer even though it was released for the first time so recently and is already out in most places. And every bit of that hype is warrented. One of my absolute favorites to date (thank God I have 5 more!) 1,007 charactersalex_hart, Jun 14, 2013

It has a nice coffee/chocolate smell.. The flavor of the coffee/chocolate flows all the way through the beer down to the last sip. The vanilla and chile are slight at the end to give it a rounded finish. Ageing this beer will just melt everything together and develop a rich full flavor that I can hardly wait to taste... 345 charactersveddajones, Jun 13, 2013

4.51/5  rDev +0.7%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Appearance- love the artwork on all their bottles. The beer itself is dark chocolate/black coffee colored. 
Smell- smells like old coffee. Definitely not its best feature. Sometimes old coffee smells good though, ya know?
Taste- tastes exactly as advertised. Big coffee flavor, lots of chocolate, delightful chili on the tip of my tongue and again on the back end, smooth vanilla flavor
Mouthfeel- extremely smooth. perfect combination of carbonation and vanilla
Overall- obviously not a regular in the rotation but a wonderful treat for special occasions (Tuesdays when you're bored)
Chukar cherries in Washington state makes Dark Chocolate Chipotle Cherries that are stupid good. This beer is those cherries crossed with a Vanilla Coke.(except all artisanal or whatever) 777 charactersBrockLanders, Jun 09, 2013

I was skeptical about the chili pepper but turned out I really enjoyed the chili pepper hint in each sip. Very full flavor with a great look and feel. Highly recommend!! 296 charactersBunnyLebowski, Jun 04, 2013
5/5  rDev +11.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This is by far Okla's best beer to date. The coffee flavor is apparent up front but not overpowering. Then the vanilla takes over to smooth it out , ending with a very slight spice (which is not spicy, but you can tell it was aged with chili peppers). I couldn't believe how well they hid 14% abv. This is one of the most impressive beers I've ever had. The only down side to this beer is the fact that it's a one time brew. 424 charactersBradleyR, Jun 04, 2013

4.79/5  rDev +6.9%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Poured into a tulip glass.
Appearance - Stout dark with a fairly decent-sized tan head. The beer leaves great lacing and alcohol legs on the glass. 
Aroma - Huge, inviting, complex aroma. Up front, I got a sweet chocolate note, along with roasted malt, coffee, and some vanilla. The chili pepper note is a bit hidden in the background, but still noticeable. 
Taste - There is a lot going on here. The taste is bold and complex. The chocolate note is less pronounced than it was in the nose, but still up front. The dark roasted malt flavor is fantastic, and complements the other flavors. The coffee is very present as well, as is the vanilla. There are also interesting, fruity and tobacco-like notes that I can't quite explain. Chili peppers become apparent at the backend, and leave a pleasing heat on the tongue.
Mouthfeel- It's medium bodied, but a bit thinner than I expected (think BA Old Rasputin). However, it coats the mouth and leaves a strong, pleasant aftertaste, accentuated by the mild chili pepper heat. 
Overall - This is an extremely solid stout, and is the best PAA beer I've had to date (which is saying a lot). It's incredibly smooth and flavorful, and really hides its 14% ABV. With so much going on, beers like this risk being unbalanced. However, here, the flavors all complement one another and all are expressed adequately. I can't wait to see how this ages. 1,389 charactersBuster, Jun 01, 2013

A- deep black with minimal brown head and no lacing

T-sweet chocolate and vanilla coffee with a small dose of heat and chocolate milk shake. Nearly perfect.
M-Viscous and creamy with a perfect amount of carbonation.
I-as good as it gets for adjunct coffee stouts. Unbelievable... 389 charactersMinorThreat, May 29, 2013
