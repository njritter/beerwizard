T # big hop resin, garlic onion in a good way, ganja, orange peel, grapefruit, tangerine
M & medium mouthfeel, alc covered at 9%, aftertaste is orange peel and grapefruit
O $ pretty damn decent beer. A little bit standard for the genre at this point imho. But a good beer. Compares to stone ruination or any other good double ipa. 606 charactersHopHunter19, Mar 11, 2017

3.77/5  rDev -15.5%look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.75Trying this at home now to give it a fair shot. Pours a golden blonde with hints of honey, light haze. Head starts off at a webby 2 fingers, then recedes somewhat quickly to a bubbly ring. 
On the aroma, tons of melon. Following with papaya, grapefruit, orange rind, and some onion. 
Taste is much better than I remember it. Tons of fruity flavors - I'm guessing amarillo, citra, and galaxy here. Some cantaloupe, watermelon, passion fruit, onion...finishing off with grapefruit and orange, and a harsh astringency. Unfortunately after the first sip it starts to decrease in quality for me and it begins tasting much like onion and astringency. Pure bitterness. That first sip is heavenly though. 
Feel is creamy and tight, leaving a resiny starch on the palate. 
Overall, yeah, again - not as great as Todd the Axeman. Todd can be drank smoothly the whole way through and doesn't depend on temperature or initial perception as much to create a killer beer. This one seems to fade fast in flavor and leaves me desiring less bitterness and more fruit. The astringency also knocks it down some. Definitely a decent beer, but not the caliber of Todd or other greats. 1,167 charactersThe-Adjunct-Hippie, Feb 15, 2017

S: Hoppy and malty, grapefruit, tropical. Nice aroma!
T: bitter and tropical, strong malt, "west coast hops", some pine. Nice balance actually.
F: Smooth and well hidden abv.
O: A very well-done classic ipa style, more west coasty than the current NE hazy treats, but I can see why this was really well-rated and popular before.  Very well recommended if you want the older classic popular dipa! 423 charactersraspy22, Jan 22, 2017

A - tall, frothy ivory head caps a hazy tangerine colored ale
S - phenomenal aroma with tropical juiciness and caramel malt; hints of mango, pineapple, mandarin orange, lemon-lime, and pine
T - very hop forward with bitter tropical notes of lemon-lime, grapefruit, mango, mandarin orange, and pine; light caramel, grain, and a touch of honey add some sweetness
M - medium body, very resinous, finishes pungently bitter and dry
O - I've had this one a couple times before (once when it was called 16 Grit) and really enjoyed it. Once again it comes through as a top-notch DIPA. 640 charactersbarnzy78, Jan 16, 2017

Pours hazy bronze with finger of medium density khaki head that had moderate retention and left windshield lacing.  Nose is dominated by pine, followed by dank, and subtle citrus.  Seems different than a lot of the other reviews, likely due to age.  Taste is heavy citrus and pine, traditional 'West side in da house', lots of grapefruit which is fine by me  .  Plenty of bitterness on the finish, lingers a bit.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied, moderate carbonation, and some astringency on the finish that left a very subtle tingling (though guess that could be from the ABV also).  Even though it was as fresh as I'd like, I was quite fond of this beer.  Can only imagine how great it must be fresh! 740 charactersjakecattleco, Jan 12, 2017

Small amount of bubbles rising. No real lacing to mention. The aroma is of tropical fruits, citrus, pine, and a little caramel. Building bitterness, and a slight ammonia-like quality in the flavor, I usually get this from Simcoe....don't know if they use it in this brew? Sweetness mid palate with those tropical fruit and citrus notes. Some slight caramel malt throughout the sip. Above average carbonation, medium full body, and quite dry, through and through. Overall, pretty nice DIPA. 578 charactersmatcris, Dec 18, 2016

O: Overall, this is a fantastic DIPA. One of my personal favorites for the category and definitely in my top rankings. The fruity/citrus notes of the Citra hops and sweetness from the oats are countered perfectly with the earthy bitterness that comes with the Warrior hops. Very drinkable. One of the few enjoyable parts of the cold MN winters. Definitely worth a try if you haven't had it or worth seeking out if you're not within distro. 1,178 charactersBeerGuy8315, Nov 27, 2016

4.76/5  rDev +6.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 510 ounce pour on draft at the brewery. 9.2%, no IBUs listed. Oatmeal DIPA Citra and Warrior hopped with Citra dry hopped. Brewed once a year. 
L - crystal clear amber color, 1.5 finger of head that goes to a nice ring around the glass. Usual DIPA lacing, not much but some. No bubbles rising, very clear beer. 
S - grapefruit all the way, subtle strong pine. Notes of grapefruit peel mostly. 
T - heavy English malt, strong grapefruit citrus, malty, and bitter pine on the finish. Excellent, can't believe this is a double IPA. 
F - IPA feel and then the booze creeps up. Perfectly balanced between the malt and the hops. Watery texture that floats over like glass. 
O - the best Double IPA in Minnesota! Lots a citrus and subtle pine with a drinkable but aggressive feel. Must try and trade but make sure it is fresh. Cheers! 831 charactersctylinebeer, Nov 22, 2016

Taste, bazing, this hits tropical fruit and grapefruit notes.  Nice light body, covers the alcohol very well though.  Ample carbonation.  Pine coming into the mouth feel.  Wow, this runs the gamut in terms of different kinds of hop flavors.  Awesome format.  This is elite tier double ipa, dry finish, hoppy aftertaste, isn't really all that abrasive after all. 502 charactersrodbeermunch, Nov 18, 2016

I've got dankness on the nose again. Garlic, green onion, sulfur and a bit of alcohol that gives way to a more lemon zest accompanied grapefruit. I could be getting a little peppery thing as well.
Taste is a punch to the tongue. Big grapefruit, big onion and big alcohol sweetness as proof of well manicured balance. Finish is a touch thinner than all the bigness would suggest, but still solid. 544 charactersgopens44, Nov 14, 2016

The taste and the nose are like  WHAT THE HELL IS THIS GENIUS LIQUID ENTERING MY MOUTH AND NOSE?!!! The only knock on this beer is the appearance. The head is kinda like meh. It appears and then dissolves pretty quickly. Other than that I just drank two of these in a row (which is pretty rare for TWO of the same beer in a row!) . Two cans straight to my mouth! If you like East Coast Ipa's and you are stranded in the midwest begging people for beer, go straight to the oasis of Abrasive and you will be satiated! Also for those that complain about the price. I really don't understand. COME ON PEOPLE. 20 bucks for 64 ounces of beer! 5 bucks per can. I bet some of you paid five bucks for a shitty beer this week at a bar. Nope. 774 charactersDetlef90, Nov 08, 2016

Medium thick mouthfeel. 
Mango, pineapple & caramel flavors up front; a drying, bitter pine finish. Lots of great fruit flavor too enjoy, but a bit too harsh on the finish. Hey, at least they warmed me! 423 charactersGuyFawkes, Nov 03, 2016

Appearance: It poured a slightly hazy golden orange colour with a slightly less than three finger off white head that had good retention and left nice lacing.
Aroma: Strong mix of tropical and citrus fruit with mango, pineapple, orange, grapefruit and pine.
Taste: Lightly sweet, candied orange, pineapple, orange zest, grapefruit pith and pine. There’s some interesting caramel and light spiciness mixed in on the finish.
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation.
Overall: This was a very nice DIPA with a good tropical and citrus punch and just a touch of sweetness which is nice. I would love to be able to try a fresher can. 727 characterskitch, May 05, 2016

As of 4 years until very recently I had a just as fruity, juicy and dank DIPA from a local brewery called Mikerphone. That beer was called Special sauce. Abrasive has been my favorite of the style for quite a while. Think I dropped over 100+ on the last release of it and it felt weird actually comparing some out of nowhere local brewery to it but it happened. It's like saying goodbye to an old friend who is moving. You'll still talk and all but now the landscape has changed. Maybe I can get my old friend and new friend to hangout together one day. 599 charactersShawnoftheD3ad, Apr 03, 2016

Taste goes in a totally different direction, with the malt coming through smoothed by the oatmeal. Plenty of bitter, but not the same dank fruity of the Citra. The feel is a bit flat up front then the bitter kicks in at the edges. The abv is very well hidden, with only a slight warming. Overall I like it, but I just would have preferred the Citra profile throughout. 476 characters98green, Mar 25, 2016

A:  Poured into a tulip to a hazy golden orange topped by tow fingers of dense white head that retains very well and leaves fantastic lacing.
S:  Smells of grapefruit rind, pine resin, citrus, and overall dankness, a little orange marmalade as well
T:  Taste is grapefruit, pine, citrus, a little orange marmalade sweetness.  This one is dominated by the hops.  Swallow is a huge blast of hop oils withe more citrus and pine
M:  Medium in body with solid carbonation and an oily hop finish.  The oatmeal provides a nice and thick smoothness to the mouthfeel as well.
O:  Pretty close to Enjoy By from Stone.  This is possibly my new benchmark of a great DIPA.  The flavors are just killer and the hop notes are very bright and powerful.  If you see this and like IPAs you need to buy it. 805 charactersSHODriver, Mar 21, 2016

Also, slightly brutal on the palate in a good way. Everyone is going completely citrus these days and this has citrus notes but so much more. A must try for IPA lovers! I've had them really fresh but this one is over two months old a slightly smoother. Holds up well with SLIGHT age compared to others. 372 charactersPauken, Mar 17, 2016

L. Beautiful copper orange in color with thick 2 finger head and very, very stick lacing. 
S. Some pine, some malt, some sweetness and some hops. 
T. Definitely getting a lot of malts and sweetness, but obviously this is due to the age of the beer. Could imagine this being world class, because even with the age, it's drinking great. Just a little malt forward since the hops gave obviously died down. 
F. Creamy medium mouthfeel with above average carbonation. 539 charactersDopen993, Feb 29, 2016

Look: Pours an amazing golden hazy yellow with about an inch of head.  Lacing is very present.
Smell: Huge notes of grapefruit and pine right off the bat.  Also hits of citrus and maybe some orange.  Smells amazing!
Taste: Taste follows the nose.  Big tastes of grapefruit, pine, hops, citrus, orange, and some malt backbone.  Not overly bitter brew and taste is on point.
Feel: Medium bodied.  Very crisp and refreshing.
Overall: Very solid double IPA here. One of the better ones I have had to date.  I highly recommend seeking this one out! 584 characterstrygelski1, Feb 22, 2016

Possibly due to the length of time the beer has been sitting. Overall very good, will revisit a fresher batch and adjust my rating as necessary. 359 charactersjphipps83, Feb 22, 2016

The Grapefruit was the standout though and I couldn't wait to try the beer.  The taste is a little bit sweet.

A: Pours a hazy golden honey color with a finger and a half of frothy white head. Head retains incredibly well before resting to a thin foamy layer atop the brew. Lacing is beautiful and plentiful.  
S: Lots of fruity citrus notes up front. Grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, mandarin orange, lemon, sweet bready malts, and pine hop aromas. Also as some slightly noticeable alcohol notes. Overall a well balanced citrus hop forward smell.
T: Fruity and sweet initially with flavors of candied fruits, sweet malts, grapefruit, tangerine, orange peel, lemon zest, pineapple, oatmeal, and caramel. Then you get some pine hop spiciness, pear, onion, alcohol, and herbal flavors. Finishes with more tropical fruit and a nice pleasant bitterness. Very well balanced and pleasant.
M: Medium bodied with a moderate amount of carbonation and a full smooth crisp clean feel. Has a slight alcohol warmth and nice lingering bitterness. 
O: A very nice DIPA. The first few times I had this brew I was completely blown away. While it has lost some of its effect on me it is still one of my favorite seasonal brews. This is a world class example of its style as it is incredibly well balanced an incredibly pleasant to drink. The aromas are the best part as they are bold, powerful and enticing from the second you crack the can. 1,343 charactersCannibalgasm, Jan 29, 2016

3.79/5  rDev -15%look: 3 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.75Pours a hazey orange-gold in color, topped with an off-white head.  Very good lacing.
BIG citrus and grapefruit rind on the nose, and if someone were to crack open a can of this at a crowded party, you might be able to catch a whiff of it at the other end of the room.  Notes of resin/pine and some sweeter orange (Valencia, maybe) at the deep end of the nose.  Notes of alcohol and (yes) even some fusel characteristics.  But the agreeable character definitely outweighs any disagreeable booziness, here, and especially for the style.
Sweet, almost too-sweet on the first sip.  Onion/garlic notes from the hops, warming sensation... and a fairly decent amount of bitterness.  Not quite dry on the finish.  There is some malt character in here, and these are competing for attention with the full-on hop assault. 
A touch of oily hop character, a bit of dry golden delicious, a bit of ripe pear, and a bit of a sweet, tropical fruit note (pineapple/mango) which is once again pummeled by the hops.
Drinkability is fairly good for the style.
Altogether it's above average for the style, but I have sampled so many in the style that by now I can also admit without much shame that it's not my favorite style. 1,211 charactersChaz, Jan 18, 2016

There is a half finger white cap of retention and spotty sheets of lacing. Smell is amazing. Grapefruit, tangerine and mango burst out of the glass with a nice bit of piney dankness as well. Taste is the same with some pineapple as well. There is a slight bit of sweet malt character, but is no match for the bitterness on the back end of this (and that's not a bad thing). Feel is medium and chewy with good carbonation. Overall an exceptional beer. Been waiting to try this one forever and it did not disappoint. 586 charactersCNoj012, Jan 17, 2016

I had this beer two different times so far, and each one tasted pretty different.  Granted, there was about two weeks of aging in between, so I'll just have to open more cans to keep exploring...
The fresher can both smelled and tasted like the dankiest, skunkiest, most pot-smelling beer I've ever tried.  The older can was a bit more juicy and fruity, with more balance and less emphasis on that thick resin and hop oil flavor.  The fresher one also felt a bit thicker and more chewy in texture, but only by a little - both have a pretty nice mouth-filling feel to them.
It's kinda remarkable how both the danker, grassier one and the less hop-intensive, mellowed out older one both honestly taste like world-class American IPAs to me.  I mean, I guess I should give demerits for having such a short shelf-life and losing so much hop character between being four weeks old and six, but as the sticky, thick hop flavor fades, it just balances out into something different but equally lovely - malty, slight tropical fruit, and such a gentle, refreshing bitterness that it doesn't offend the palate one bit like some other IPAs with more hops than is good for them.  
So three cheers to Surly, who have made one of my new top favorite IPAs. 1,323 charactersjmasher85, Jan 11, 2016

The intensity of the hop aroma punched me right in the teeth. It was as if I had gotten into a bar fight, and a BIG son from Texas, crushed a miller lite bottle across my tranquil jaw line. Battle the urge to not pass out from the loss of blood, I grab on to the nearest object that is bolted to the greasy, beer battered floor. Struggling to arise and regain my confidence, a local savior helps me to my quivering feet. (Picture the scene in the bible where Simon of Cyrene helps Jesus to his feet after falling the third time under the cross).
Finally grasping onto the rail of the bar, I regain my stance. Violence and carnage has spread through the bar like the wildfires in Africa during the dry season. Hoots, and hollers echo, and vibrate throughout the old brick building. Dust cascades downwards from the ancient ceiling. The particles pass in front of the dim lights, trying to reach the floor undisturbed. 
Now that I have regained consciousness I can finally sip on the abrasive beer that has already dragged me through a field of those barb balls that stick to your clothing during your hiking days in the iron range of Northern Minnesota. Woah. WOAH! EASY DOES IT BRAVO! (Said like a regal Civil war general trying to calm down his horse). 
The awesome power of the citra hops pelt me to no end. Seemingly endless, Brett Favre fires round after round of citra hops the size of footballs into my ribs and throat. I beg for death to wrap his gentle, bony hands around my throat, and end this madness. But being death, he taunts his victim (me), and sits patiently. Staring through my eyes, into another realm of existence. "Please! PLEASE!" I begin to wail and chant. Trapped. Nowhere to go. To weak to run. The warrior hops come in to finish me off. With an earthy like vengeance, they ride in on a flock of 1970's El Camino's, strapped to the gills with ancient Greek weaponry. 
They drift dangerously close to my head. Aggressively stepping out of their magical wagons, they walk towards me. Kicking earth, and bitter hops of their own kin into my mouth, they scoff and growl. "PLEASE! IF THERE IS A GOD PLEASE END THIS PAIN OF EXISTENCE!" I proclaim as a last shout to the heavens. 
Then. Just then, Oatmeal rides down in his chariot  from the electrifying clouds above. Like Zeus he fires bolts of lightening downwards upon his victims. The warrior hops scatter, like cave goblins in the face of light! They pile back into their bad ass El Camino's and take stride back to the depths from which they came.
"Oatmeal. Sweet, sweet oatmeal.....thank..you for saving me. You have saved my palate from the ever reckoning bitter hops.Bless you oatmeal. Bless you."
And just like that, death finally rubbed his fingers over my eyes. Closing them permanently. 
Ladies and gentlemen. That is what drinking this beer is like. 2,890 charactersDaddyFist, Jan 07, 2016

Smell is fabulous: papaya, mango, citrus explosion, with bit of bread and malt in back. Taste is really hop dominated, same tropical fruit that comes in the nose but with more sweet notes, ends with bitter finish that gets a bit muddled as you drink. Mouth is crisp, very easy drinking for an imperial ipa. 
This hangs with the big boys except for the back end of the taste. But that's a minor quibble; excellent beer. 481 charactersAppaZappa, Jan 06, 2016

4.76/5  rDev +6.7%look: 4.25 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Look: Strong bold pumpkin color, non-translucent, great healthy 1.5/2 finger head. A pretty DIPA.
Smell: Loads of tropical fruit and candied Mandarin and sweet clementine orange. Pineapple. A touch of marzipan? One of, if not my favorite smelling pale ale. Just an onslaught of hops.
Taste: A metric f*ck ton of sweet orange, papiya, mango from the hops. A touch of alcohol sweetness at the front swept away by a bit of prickly, sharp floral bitterness. Strong malt backbone to support the hops, but it is definitely a beer with the hops as the spotlight.
MF: It's great. Smooth, silky, medium mouthfeel. Lingers on the tongue. 630 charactersSpinaltapped, Jan 05, 2016
4.07/5  rDev -8.7%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4Hazy, mildly turbid, light golden yellow body, off-white velvet head with intricate blankets of lace. (Although, the next can produced a perfectly translucent body.) Orange/grapefruit nose, mint, bitter, herbal, with bready malt behind it. Bitter citrus fruit dominate the flavor (grapefruit!), slight onion, lavender syrup, with oats as a sweet nearly caramel-like backbone, harsh mint on the finish. Olfactory and gustatory senses are huge and, well, abrasive. Body is crisp, quenching, refreshing, fluid and drinkable.
Big big flavors here, a hophead's dream, just a tad too bitter for my tastes, and I couldn't appreciate the oats- the flavor imparted was less than desirable, and the intended rich mouthfeel didn't appear for me. 734 characters1000lbgrizzly, Jan 05, 2016

S: Not sure of the hops on this beer but sure does smell like a ton of Citra. Lemon, grapefruit, and orange. A little resin in the finish.
T: Follows the nose. Sweet candied tropical fruits followed by a nice solid bitterness. 
F: Mouth coating feel. Somewhat creamy.
Overall another one of those great hop forward DIPAs. 395 charactersMyThoughtsExactly, Jan 03, 2016

A: The beer is a bright gold color with a medium off-white head that fades quickly and leaves a thick lace on the glass.
S: The aroma contains grassy hops, fruity citrus and caramelized malts.
T: The taste starts out with flavors a strong piney hops bitterness. Then some sweet flavors of citrus and caramel come in. The malt character is hearty but not too heavy and brings a very good balance. The after-taste is slightly hoppy and slightly sweet.
M: Crisp and very smooth, medium body, medium carbonation, finish is clean for the style.
O: Very tasty, goes down dangerously easy, not too filling, good kick, very good representation of style, this is a very nice 2IPA to drink for a long time. 836 charactersTheManiacalOne, Dec 27, 2015

 pour is nice - hazy orange with a thick, white head. looks like a good beer.
smell is citra - citrus fruit with a touch of pine. taste is citra - sweet, pulpy fruits. there's a touch of pine and bitterness at the end, but nothing too much to be offputting. 
feel is syrupy and clinging - robitussin-like in how it lingers. for 9%, the alcohol is hidden wonderfully, so there's that.
if i liked citra, i'd probably love this beer. but i don't. it's one note at best and it gets old for 16oz. 645 charactersEvilyak, Dec 14, 2015

I've had IPAs and DIPAs that are pretty bitter and might qualify as "abrasive" but this beer is not like that.  Most of the flavor I get is fruity and rich and malty, not just bitterness for the sake of bitterness.  Yes, there's a bitter kick at the end, just to remind you that is a DIPA, but it's a minor part of the overall taste profile.  This would be in my top 10 of "beers I wish were distributed in the state of Washington," and it's one of my favorite DIPAs ever.

Poured from can into a Sam Smit pint glass.  Nice hazy orange with 1 finger head that continues to hold 5 minutes in.  About as good looking as an IPA I've seen in a glass.  Smell is all bursting with grapefruit and citrus hop greatness. Taste is powerful hopness, with a really nice mix of citrus, pine and some dankness and some of the oats is noticable.  Bitter on the finish which is the only negative but its tolerable considering how good this beer tastes.  Very rich feel as well.  Overall, its an excellent double IPA. 624 charactersbubseymour, Dec 06, 2015

T:  A little more muted than the aroma but very similar, citrus and piney hop flavor, the pine combines with the late lingering bitter which was the only downfall.  Otherwise, wonderful.

Mind-blowing aroma of citra hops: grapefruit and a hint of orange. Taste is similar but there's a touch of sweetness balancing out the bitter hoppiness. Mouthfeel is slightly thin for a 2XIPA but there's also a creamy quality to it. This is a superb tasting and extremely well-balanced beer. Truly world class. 371 charactersQbdoo, Dec 05, 2015

The smell is beautiful. The perfect mixture of citrus and grass. I could sniff this all night long and say "wow". It tastes even better; superb balance of nose and taste, an absolute treat. I get a bit of burnt melon on the back end, but it does nothing to detract from the pineapple on the front, and velvety texture mid-finish. This is a really nice beer. 466 charactersTheIPAHunter, Nov 30, 2015

Two fingers of white head that dissipates fairly quickly and leaves minimal lacing. The aroma is big with a lot of tropical fruits, melon, pine, resin, dank. The taste matches, although not quite as powerfully. The hop presence is the initial flavor, and then a balanced, malty body leaves some slight sweetness on the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is medium, moderate carbonation, and a balanced finish. The oatmeal adds to a very smooth body. Overall, a really well done, balanced DIPA. 523 charactersBSiegs, Nov 25, 2015

4.46/5  rDev 0%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Pours a clear golden color with a large white foam head. Recedes after a few minutes, leaving a thin head on the surface and a lot of lacing on the sides.
Aroma is very strong on tropical fruits. Pineapple, grapefruit, mango, and tangerine. Citra hops and light pine.
This is quite the bitter/hop bomb. This brew is hoppy enough as it is, but add in the bitterness and this one one unique brew! Grapefruit, orange, and pineapple are very strong on the front. Taste is much stronger on the citrus and pine than the aroma. Some very sweet malts on the back end.
Medium bodied, and quite sticky going down. The 9% ABV is masterfully masked, with the only hint of alcohol coming from the slight buzz I got from it. 
An excellent effort from Surly. Pleased to find this (rather surprisingly) on the shelf of my local small-town Co-Op. After being slightly discouraged from my disappointing experience with Todd The Axe Man, Surly delivers here with Abrasive. If you like hops and bitterness, look no further than this beer. 1,022 charactersmajorbase2, Nov 23, 2015

4.36/5  rDev -2.2%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Can dated 10/27:
Pours a slightly hazy golden yellow, with perhaps a splash of orange.  Fluffy white head that continues to cover the surface through the drink.  Some lacing.
Nose is melon, tropical fruit, pineapple and sweet orange or tangerine.  Decent strength and generally sweet.
Taste is a little more tart to open, the pineapple/orange note hitting first.  Then the tropical and melon notes hit, along with the lightest heat from alcohol (on a colder beer more so).  Flavors just fade to a lightly fruit-sweet taste.  The interesting thing is that taste does cling to the tongue a while.  With subsequent sips, this slowly builds up and has a pithiness to it-but the other flavors never let it take full hold.  Feel is enveloping and sort of soft, and about medium in body.
Wonderful beer, reminds me in certain ways of OTWOA, although this is a bit more citrus and is softer. 886 characterscjgiant, Nov 22, 2015

Pours slightly hazed golden with lasting creamy white head. Lacing sticks.
There is a heavy dose of pine, grapefruit, pineapple and tangerine.
The taste of bitter pink grapefruit and tangerine (some pineapple) is balanced by a candy-like malt sweetness that is just enough to give it a pleasant balance. Alcohol very well-hidden - hardly noticeable if at all. Long pleasantly bitter, fruity hop finish.
Full-bodied and very smooth.
A "hop head" delight for sure! Huge punch of delicious hop goodness, but silky smooth malt backbone. Very nice to say the least! 581 charactersjwc215, Nov 22, 2015

Best thing is how clean and clear it is.  Nice fluffy head to boot.  Best looking DIPA I have seen.  Smells of hops buried under citrus like grapefruit, oranges or tangerines and mangos.  Smell is quite alluring.  Taste is wild.  Big citrus up front balanced by high hops for a really drinkable beer. Very smooth for something with such high abv.  Finishes a little piney rather than huge piney because of all the citrus.  IPAs are not my thing but even I love this beer.  Just the right thickness and feel.

Aromas of huge grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, papaya, mango, lemon zest, orange peel, citrus rind, pine, light honey, bread, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness.

Fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of dank citrus/tropical/piney hops and moderate pale malt sweetness; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero astringent flavors after the finish. Good amount of dryness from bitterness as well. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth, sticky/resinous, and lightly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an incredible DIPA. All around fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of dank citrus/tropical/piney hops and moderate pale malt sweetness; and very smooth and easy to drink for the ABV.

Right from the moment the can was cracked a blast of hops explodes out. When poured, a thick billowing white head tops a surprisingly clear light pale body. Nose is akin to...Pliny? Maybe a bit more pop. Rich citrus, pine, hints of fresh fruit. Taste is heavy bitterness mixed with alcohol sweetness. Creamy mid body with a crisp finish. This is one killer IPA. 408 charactersfrasergrove, Nov 20, 2015

The appearance was a nice looking hazy orange to brown color with a decent one finger white foamy head that dissipated within about a minute. Once the head died down, the lacing wove around the glass in a nice speckled sort of fashion. The smell had a nice blend of sweet citrus to sweet sharp freshly cut pine and it came through in a strong aromatic way allowing a decent sweet maltiness to come out as it warmed. The taste took all of those previously mentioned flavors and added a nice sweet maltiness coating my taste buds. On the palate, this one sat about a medium on the body with a fairly decent sessionability about it. The carbonation was there. The normal harshness of an AIPA was there assaulting my tongue very good. Overall, what a great beer all around. Well worthy of having again. 830 charactersBack_in_the_Saddle, Nov 18, 2015

A= Golden straw color, pretty clear overall with a thick white head made of small bubbles.  Head settles, rings the glass, and lacing clings to the side.
S= Big mix of hop aroma including pine and citrus up front which is followed by a dose of earthy resin.
T= Get citrus and pine first.  Grapefruit, lemon zest followed by a bit of earthy pine and dankness.  Bit of sweet malt and toast in the finish.
M= Medium body with moderate carbonation.
O= Lots of strong hop aroma and flavor balanced nicely.  Quite easy to drink for a 9% ABV DIPA.  No noticeable booziness or alcohol burn. 682 charactersjhavs, Nov 16, 2015

4.85/5  rDev +8.7%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75From a tallboy canned 10/28/15, so 2 weeks ago. Color is a very slightly hazy orange honey-gold. Three-finger head is off-white, dense and creamy, and it sticks around. Decent lacing. Smell starts with a big hit of pine and grapefruit, mixed with high-quality dank and just a soupçon of the finest cat pee expertly blended with week-old gym clothes. Some tangerine notes as well. That either dissipates or my pine/grapefruit/dank/urine smell receptors are crammed full, but next come waves of ripe tropical fruit and an earthy grassiness. 
Taste progresses like the smell (minus the pee), starting with strong citrus and pine resin, then moving to the earthy/fruity flavors, with just a hint of bready malt appearing briefly before the pretty big, dry pine resin finish that sticks around a long time. 
Feel is medium but fairly substantial, with the slightest touch of oily slickness, but in the best possible way. I personally don't care for IPAs that are overly slick feeling, but this one threads the needle perfectly, and the smoothness is masterfully offset with just the right amount of prickly carbonation. My nucleated nonic pint glass shows a steady steram of the tiniest possible bubbles rising up the entire time. Minutes after a sip I'm still chewing on the piney bitterness, though it's not at all astringent or unpleasantly extreme. 
This is a great, great beer, and one that lives up to the world-class rep. It's wonderfully complex, yet from beginning to end it hangs together beautifully, with not a note out of place. Killer stuff, and one of my all-time favorites. 1,588 charactersBeers-es, Nov 13, 2015

Aroma definitely shows off the Citra hop. The nice sugary sweetness from the oats and 2-row go perfectly with the Citra characteristics and make it a very juicy aroma. Get pineapple, mango, lots of orange, grapefruit, all being the overly-ripe, juicy variety. Also get a big herbaceous dankness. Awesome.
Taste follows the aroma, which is what I was hoping. Get tons of overly-ripe, juicy fruits. Get mango, some pineapple, good amount of orange marmalade, and grapefruit. Lots of dankness too. Get just a simple sweetness from the light malt to provide an nice canvas for the hops. Bitterness is pretty tame compared to what the title suggests, but you still get a slight pine resin, citrus peel bitterness there. Dries out nicely into that slightly bitter finish. Very light booze taste on the finish too.
Medium body. Outstanding smoothly crisp, creamy mouthfeel. Finishes oily and sticky.
This one gets a lot of hype, but it is well-deserved. Judging by their Todd the Axeman and Abrasive, Surly really knows how to brew with Citra. A wonderfully complex DIPA that stands up there with some of the better ones out there. 1,197 charactersbrewskis, Nov 08, 2015

Look = 4.25 Pours a densely cloudy, murky but vibrant orange color with tons of floating particulates and sediment; 1.5 fingers of crisp, white head composed fades to a ring but leaves a nice lace.
Aroma = 4.5 Big fruity hop aromas, tons of citrus and tropic fruit notes dominate the aroma. There is also a nice sweet malty backbone; overall the aroma is strong and fragrant. Very pleasant.
Taste = 4.75 Actually outshines the aroma a little bit; tons of citrus, orange, pineapple and other tropical fruit flavors; some balance is provided with a nice light malty backbone and a significant bitter finish.
Feel = 4.5 Full bodied with low to medium carbonation; smooth feel, nice body for a DIPA.
Drinkability = 4.5 Very easy drinking for a DIPA at 9%.
Overall = 4.55 Terrific double IPA, among the best I’ve had. Lots of citra hop flavors and a nice bettering presence from the Warrior hops, strong in every category. 992 characterskbwalters, Nov 06, 2015

A very full flavor, with a lot of citrus-filled hops and sweet malt tones. Body is present, but not overpowering. Feel is dry, which is not necessarily a feature which I always appreciate in DIPAs. 375 charactersWer34truh, Nov 05, 2015

Look: pours an amber, translucent color, with some good carbonation.
Smell: the smell is awesome. The hops give a tropical fruit scent and a little pine. Also a bit of an alcohol smell? 
Taste: the taste follows the nose then gets real bitter. There's a slight alcohol taste to it, but the brew is 9%. 
Feel: the beer seems medium bodied, and has a dry finish, but not as extreme as I've had
Overall: this is a great beverage, and worth picking up a 4 pack. 573 charactersCfred371, Nov 05, 2015

Pours a rich golden color with a thick white head that lasts for a while.  Citrus and pine are the first thing I smell, followed by hops.  Very smooth and drinkable.

L - Pours a vibrant straw/yellow/orange color with a fluffy lacey head. 
S - WONDERFUL hints of grapefruit, pineapple and other citrus fruit. 
T - Nose is an aggressive warrior hop bitterness and finishes out malty/alcohol wonderful hints of oatmeal, pineapple, malt sweetness 
F - absolute PERFECT mouth feel - one of the few 5's i've given for mouth feel on a double. something about the oatmeal and the hops and the malt. the carbonation is perfect as well
O - The best double IPA minnesota has to offer if not the best beer in all of Minnesota. Top 5 IIPA for sure.
***EDIT: After having out of the can -- the aroma is UNBELIEVABLE -- top aroma I've ever had from a beer. Updated to a 5 aroma and 5 taste. Favorite IIPA i've had to date -- SOS is right there with it. 872 charactersthorkelson, Nov 03, 2015

Can to tulip. 
A. Bright copper color with an egg shell head. The head is a few fingers after a generous pour that slowly retreats to a similar film that leaves spotty laces. Great effervesce. The color stands out- this is a good looking beer.
S. The nose bursts with tropical fruits and a tad pine at the end. The notes were grapefruit, pineapple, tangerine and pine sap. This has a strong fragrance. This is heading in the right direction.
T. The taste follows the nose with the majority of the hop profile towards the tropical end. The hop presence is magnificent, way over the top in a great way. I got a light malt backbone - which I really like.
M. Smooth, but the full body/hops leaves a bitter bite. High to moderate carbonation. 
O. For some reason I was skeptical about this ale and I was blown away. This is an excellent DIPA, worth the hassle to try. This is up there with the best - fo sho. 962 charactersmacher0, Aug 05, 2015

3.53/5  rDev -20.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3 | feel: 2.5 |  overall: 3.5From notes.  Based on almost all of the reviews, I was really looking forward to this beer.  Maybe my expectations were too high or maybe I had a bad can (about 3 months old; can dated 2-06-15, drank on 4-25-15), but I was a little disappointed.  Slightly hazy, bright golden color.  Not much of a head which disappears quickly.  Nice citrus aroma with just a little pine.  Taste also big citrus and grapefruit, but quite a lot of pine bitterness as well.  Bitterness was a little too much for me and not well integrated with the other flavors.  The bitterness also lingered too long, limiting smoothness and drinkability. The alcohol is covered well.  Not much malt sweetness or balance but good fullness of flavor. 716 characters4thFloyd, Jul 21, 2015

It's complex, yet simple... marmalade, tangerine, orange juice, some conifer bitterness... and the mouthfeel is damn near sexual in nature.

A — Pours a deeply bright orangey color, copper tinged edges and body, very bright overall. Thin white head leaves behind some nice lacing.
S — Smells mostly malty, this isn't as fresh as I would have liked. Still, there are nice notes of citrus, mango, lemon, grassy.
T — Tastes of bright pineapple, sweet meyer lemon, mango, honeydew melon, bright and citrusy and clean.
M — Medium-Full bodied, long and lingering finish, a bit heavy if anything.
O — Great overall, still holds up with a few months on it, this is a great beer, would love to have it fresh off the tap. 626 charactersMoose90, Jun 01, 2015

S: Immediately upon opening the can, I smell grapefruit, pine and some floral notes. Upon pouring it into a glass, more malty notes begin to emerge. There's a candied like sweetness which is present.
T: Seems to be more of a malt forward DIPA. Pine like hops are present along with a dry, crisp somewhat citrusy like finish.

4.82/5  rDev +8.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75I've been wanting to try this for quite sometime and finally with the help of Omensetter got a chance to try it!
A - Very bright golden orange color. Some what hazy from the amount of dry hops. It almost look like there is fruit added with some of the bubbles getting stuck in the thick resinous beer. The head is small and fine white that subsides quickly but has some residual lacing.
S - HUGE HOP FRAGRANCE! It almost rivals Pliny in aromatics with tons sweet citrus/orange/grapefruit/tangerine just bursting out of the glass. As I cracked the can there were so many fragrances that I didn't even have to pour before I knew how good this could be. There is some pine, herbal, and resin to go with it basically just a big, juice-inspired hop bomb.
T - Lots of hop flavor coming out of this one. Mostly the grapefruit and tangerine along side the pine, herbal, and resin character. There is some malt but it is very light and no alcohol to be found. The bitterness is very strong and stronger than I would have expected from the amount of sweet aromatics but it is clear that the warrior hops provide a bitterness to be reckoned with. It is this big bitterness without a serious malt backbone that makes this beer not quite a 5-star beer but very close.
M - Medium to high mouth-feel with light carbonation. It is definitely going for lots of flavor to be savored and not to be pounded. The body is quite thick for a 9% DIPA with the addition of oats and the massive amount of hop resin in this beer. 
Overall, I am thinking of this beer as the Pliny of Minnesota. With it's huge aromatics and a robust hop flavor this one gives all DIPAs out there a run for their money. I really enjoyed the body and hop profile but I hope that they add some more crystal malt in the future to add maltiness to this hop explosion. I would still strongly recommend this beer and is worth trading for the next time that a fresh release comes out.

Beautiful pour...orangey light rusty accents with a rich creamy head. Big citric and tangy spice nose and complex breads and fruit flavor. Citra forward. Malts from oats/grains really added a nice touch of sweet creamy offset to the rich tangerine/citrus flavors. Expected a nice rounding in the mouth feel and wasn't disappointed.
Having said that...found it very full and assertive...not really abrasive...so to speak.

Pours an orange-amber color, with a half finger broad, white head.
Intriguing aromas of grass, lime, pineapple and biscuity, sweeter malts. Due to the prominent malts, the fruity hops melt well into the beers sweetness, evoking aromas of juicy ananas dipped into honey, with a prikly kiwi peak to it. 
Lively, slightly metallic mouthfeel, highlighting the citrus qualities of the beer.
Tastes of citrus, with a dank quality to it and balancing, earthy malts. This is bursting with hops, unleashing a very bitter, slightly tropical onslaught, almost overpowering my palate. It does not, because of glazed malts, providing nothing more but a basic malt presence, letting the hops shine big times. Finishes with an immense, dry bitterness, accentuating citrus hops, which stay on the tongue for a very long time.
Pine and honey, accompanied by a subtle metallic hint, resulting from the carbonation, interact incredible well with the tongue numbing citrus bitterness, tranforming the taste more and more into a tropical fruit direction, due to the distinct, honeyed malts infusion. This beer is truly abrasive, while it highlights all the positive characteristics of a well composed IIPA. Its versatile in taste, while it provides a merciless bitterness, wrapped up by citraic fruits and honeyed malts. 1,323 charactersaleigator, Apr 07, 2015

Appearance:  Pours a deep amber with a slight haze and 1/2 a finger of head
Smell:  Citrus hops with strong aromas of pine
Taste:  Similar hop profile to the aroma, lots of grapefruit and citrus zest with some peach in the finish
Mouthfeel: Crisp finish, bitterness is intense but well controlled
Overall:   A great example of making an intense DIPA that still offers a lot of balance for experienced hop heads.  Always impressive to have this much hop flavor without an overly sticky finish. 556 charactersTuck_leepulin, Mar 28, 2015

This one pours a slightly hazy burnt orange color, with a half inch head, and tons of lacing.
This one smells quite herbal, a bit of marijuana, with a good amount of juicy, pungent citrus fruit as well. The smell just jumps out of the glass.
This one is so fruity, so wonderful, and so hoppy. Moderately bitter, with some pine resin, with a lot more juicy fruit- orange, pineapple, and some grapefruit. This one is pretty sweet, but that's balanced by the bitter pine and the herbal character as well. There's not much in the malt department, and nothing in the alchohol department- it's not noticeable at all.
This has a very juicy mouthfeel, with a body of medium heft. The carbonation is fairy low, but not distractingly so. I'm not sure if this is the normal level of carbonation, or it's lower than usual as per some of the 2015 batch(es) of Abrasive. No matter, though, it's still carbonated, and it still tastes quite good.
This deserves it's status as one of the best IPAs in the country. So good. 1,055 charactersGreesyFizeek, Mar 25, 2015

A: Hazy golden orange with a creamy head that leaves a good bit of lacing on the glass
S: Bright citra hops, candied white grapefruit, light pine, and some boozy malts. Love the nose on this one: simple but aggressive.
T: Dominated by notes of bitter white grapefruit flesh, pine needles and sap, sweet candied citrus, and fresh-cut grass or flowers. Extremely refreshing, and not too boozy (though there's no doubt you're drinking a high ABV beer). I like that it's fairly sweet, but not caramely or saccharine like so many amateur DIPAs.
M: Sticky and substantial, but really easy drinking. Light carb contributing to that creamy mouthfeel.
O: One of my favorite DIPAs, right up there with Bodhi and Hopslam and maybe only slightly lagging behind Permanent Funeral. A fantastic nose, an intense flavor profile, and a wonderful mouthfeel make for a great beer-drinking experience. Holds up well, too: had about 12 of these over the last month and there's only a very minor issue with the hops falling off. 1,100 charactersblankenhoney, Mar 23, 2015

L:  Beautiful hazy yellow with a rich white head on the pour that left little to no lacing. 
S: Citra hops all over on the nose, bright citrus tones, subtle pine. Underneath it all the booziness of the malt is detectable, yet in a nice way.
T: Super balanced DIPA/IIPA.  I get great bitterness from the warrior hops up front in my face, but it finishes so nicely with that smooth maltiness of the oats and 2-row. Super drinkable big beer.  Grapefruit and resin, wow.
F:  Light body and carbonation, goes down easy.  Smooth smooth smooth.  
O: Great beer, would love a four pack for the fridge to finish a day off with.  I think this would have been even better if I didn't have Heady and Pliny the day before.  Still a beer I'll be seeking. 807 charactersSLubeski, Mar 23, 2015

Smell is a bright floral citrus, tropical fruit, apricot, grape fruit, with notes of caramel. Beautiful citrus hop forward flavor with notes of tangerine, balanced nicely with subtle sweet malt, finished with a mild grape fruit bitterness. One of the most flavorful DIPAs I've ever had. Clean and bright, yet doesn't miss a beat with such intense flavors. One of the best DIPAs I've ever had! A real treat from Surly that is a must have 503 charactersRyBrew54, Mar 17, 2015

Pours a lightly-orange amber with a finger of head that quickly dissapates, but leaves behind lots of sticky lacing on the thistle shaped glass.
The Aroma is an inviting mix of pine and citrus with no detectable harshness.
The first sip is filled with mixed citrus flavors, as expected with the massive amount of citra hops in this brew, with a little of the expected resinous overtone. Subsequent sips increased in resinous flavor, but with no significant alcohol burn. Well balanced by the malt sweetness for such a hoppy ale. Long, bitter finish.
Light carbonation on the tongue and a medium, silky body from the added oatmeal round out the experience.
Overall, a top notch DIPA with a powerful, yet inviting hops character, nicely balanced with well hidden alcohol. Brilliant! 818 charactersmnredsoxfan69, Mar 16, 2015

Smell: Great! fresh pines and tropical.
Taste: Just like it smells.
Feel: Just the right amount of carbonation and very oily. Just the right amount of bitterness.
Overall: It's a big DIPA. I'm really surprise how well it held up being 8 weeks from canning date. Will seek out next year for sure. 387 charactersKMachHops, Mar 15, 2015

4.25/5  rDev -4.7%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Deep golden yellow pour. Just a hair more clear than opaque. Fairly large foamy white head that disappears almost entirely into the beer. 
Some mandarin orange/tangerine and mango jump out of the glass along with carmalized malts with fairly subtle hops. 
As soon as it hits my mouth, I am wondering where the hell all of this hop flavor was when I stuck my nose in it. There is certainly no shortage. There is a TON of bitterness. Almost too much. Lots of citrus. Like ground up grapefruit rinds and melon. I would like to say ther is some floral and pine aspects there too, but the bitterness is really numbing. A good amount of swertness. An orange like type though that is slightly sour along with mango and pineapple. The strong malt base that I smelled tries to fight it's way back into the game toward the end. I think the alcohol is a bit noticeable. 
The body is pretty good. Definitely a slick, resin feel that coats your tongue. Carbonation is slightly lower than average. 
My general impression (yes, I do impressions) is that this could be more balanced. It is kind of all over the place. I do really like the flavors, but it is such a palate wrecker, it almost makes it a little harder to enjoy. It is one of those beers that I want more of while I am drinking it, but kind of regret it later. Still a great beer that is really, really close to being world class for me and doesn't fall short of it's namesake in any way. It reminds me a bit of Jai Alai on crack and PCP, shotgunning Red Bull. Hopheads take note. 1,531 charactersWesMantooth, Mar 04, 2015

Aroma: The aroma of the Citra hops comes through first with grapefruit and tangerines.
Taste: Fruit forward from the Citra with a nice earthy bitterness from Warrior hops.
Mouthfeel: Medium Body rounded off by the oats
Overall: A delicious DIPA. Too bad not available in NYC. 315 charactersKanger, Mar 04, 2015

S.  Big grapefruit and citrus notes.  I can smell it a fit and a half away from me and that is good.  Some candied orange peel.
T.  Wow this is good.  Backing up the nose I get done nice citrus up front followed by doing nice but not overbearing bitterness.  Grassy aftertaste.
M.  Medium bodied with a nice blend of carbonation.  Finishes with a slight dryness.
O.  An outstanding IIPA.  Some nice citrus and a balanced amount of bitterness to offset it nicely.  Very good body and carbonation for a IIPA. They did a good job with this beer. 665 charactersIPAGeorge, Feb 26, 2015

Glad I finally got to try this long time want of mine. Pretty much lives up to it's hype. Pours a gorgeous hazy gold color with minimal lacing. Aromas are primarily grapfruit, mango and tangerine. Taste is similar with a subtle oaty touch I have to close my eyes to detect and finishes with a funky onion and garlic taste at the end which brings it down ever so slightly.

A: Pours a mostly clear golden-orange color. 3/4-finger white head. Just a touch of haziness and sediment to it.
S: Lots of orange, pineapple and mango. Noticeable malt background in the aroma, it's not just 100% pure hop bomb here. There's also a touch of piney hop aromas as well.
T: Grapefruit, tangerine, and a hint of pineapple. Lots of biscuity malt backbone. Lots of citrus rind as well, like grapefruit or orange peel. 
M: Pretty balanced for a DIPA, with a lot of malt character. Very, very acidic and bitter on the finish. Tons of hop resins coating the tongue here. Alcohol neither hidden nor overpowering. 
O: Huge expectations going into this one, like Heady Topper-type expectations, and it just didn't quite live up for me. This is a super fresh can, but it was just underwhelming. I've had all the greats, and this one just doesn't stand out. I've had Hopslam recently, and I actually prefer that one quite a bit. This one is a bit too bitter and strong for me, and the aroma just didn't wow like the others did. Overall, it's a great DIPA, but just not magical like some build it up to be.
Recommendation: Not worth giving up an arm or a leg for, but if you can easily snag one, I'd jump on it. 1,302 charactersSparty1224, Feb 22, 2015

A- pours a slightly hazy-but-bright golden orange color with a small creamy white head that reduces to a film on top, some nice lacing left behind 
S- fresh leafy and earthy hop aroma up front is quickly complemented by tangerine and grapefruit peel, some piney resin, mango, passionfruit & fresh grass
T- fresh minty and leafy hop flavors up front with some green earthy notes, tangerine zest and grapefruit peel add a nice citrus aspect, piney resin and fresh grass kick in before finishing with a slightly malty sweetness, green melon and mango fruit linger long after consumption 
M- medium viscous body with medium carbonation turns into a thick and creamy mouthfeel that continues into a creamy, slightly warming finish.  The oats aren't really detectable in taste, but this is where they shine.  They add a creamy complexity that works brilliantly with the strong hop flavors
O- this one lived up to the hype, a hop explosion that is completed nicely with a thick any creamy, oat filled body.  Worth the wait 1,070 charactersTreyliff, Feb 20, 2015

4.56/5  rDev +2.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I've not tasted a double IPA that balances the extreme hop bitterness like this one. It has a lot more bite than hopslam, but it doesn't let the bitter bite dominate the rest of the beer. Citrus and stone fruit shine through gloriously in the aroma and the taste. That balance alone would make a great IPA, but there is an earthy quality as well. One reviewer described it as herbal. It works wonderfully adding flavor and complexity to an already great beer. Best IPA I have tasted yet. Edit: I've received this in trade on two different occasions since my review and both times it has been average at best. One of those cans was two months old, but the other one was relatively fresh. I'm adjusting my rating, but still want to try this one more time when I'm sure it is fresh to confirm my initial review. 808 charactersdanh53, Feb 16, 2015

Appearance: Light clear bronze color, decent amount of head at first but then settles to nothing at all. 
Smell: Floral and lots of tropical fruits, mango's some piney notes a little herbal.
Taste: Bitter and biting but not overly so, it smooths out and is very enjoyable on the mid palate. Lots of tropical fruits and stone fruits prevail, but you also get an earthy pine note in there as well. Very strong resinous IPA but totally drinkable.
Overall: Very well worth the ratings, solid brew! 524 charactershumuloner22, Feb 13, 2015

4.46/5  rDev 0%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25This brew was served on tap from the upstairs walk-up bar, at the new Surly taproom in Minneapolis, Minnesota.  Arriving in a pair of thick house tulips, Abrasive shined the color of a freshly polished penny.  A half finger tall head the color of French lace stood tall, leaving milky ring etchings around our glasses following a medium retention.  A chill haze obscured clarity, but no sediment was noted.  Carbonation appeared to be mildly moderate.  The nose filled with airs that were oh, so sticky sweet, with big grapefruity citric hoppiness complimented by heavy grassy and fruity nectar varietals, pale and clean caramel malty sweetness, mango and pineapple flesh and syrup juiciness, sweet cornbread, cooling vanilla bean, hot honey, warming white and caramel sugars, toffee, white chalk on sweating asphalt, green grassiness, hearty boozy sweetness, and mild shoe polish bite.  The flavoring…BOOM!!  We experienced massively bittering citric hop, fruitiness of pineapple, pear, and kiwi, grapefruity skin and juicy wash, underripe strawberries, lemon rind, warmer herbal hop rumbles, green weediness, aloe, foamy plastics, almond extract, bubblegum esters, dandelion, pine sap, worty caramel and pale malt toast, hints of silky fresh oats, and lipstick waxiness.  Through the end and aftertaste, flashes of black pepper and old, dried cinnamon, big but welcomed boozy warmth, hoppy garlic airiness akin to Summit hop varietals, and harsh medicinal phenolic wash poked through intermittently.  The body sat on the fuller side of medium, while carbonation was higher, but still only gently brushed the palate.  Slurp and smack were great, with slightly less cream or froth.  The latter were still present enough to contribute towards an initially wet and cooling coating.  This dripped into bittering puck and decent astringent dryness.  The abv was appropriate, and drinkability was frankly amazing.
Overall, what a fantastic beer to start your night with.  Actually, we started and ended our night with pours of Abrasive at the new Surly brewpub (which is gorgeous, by the way).  This was actually kind of an emotional experience for us.  We had visited Minneapolis a few weeks prior to this trip, but unfortunately were unable to get over to Surly.  Very sad.  We happened to get a chance for a second trip to Minneapolis for work, and were so thankful for the opportunity to make time during this return visit.  If we’re not mistaken, the day we arrived at the brewpub was their annual release day for Abrasive; a beer that has been ever elusive for us, at least for the past few years.  It was such a nice surprise to see it one tap, and we had to go for it.  Thus, the two glasses a piece.  What a journey the beer itself is.  The nose is sweet and warming simultaneously, making that first sip irresistible joy.  It shocks you with intense citric and grapefruit bitterness, then the sweetness hits.  Finally, the booze and chemicals wash you away for this amazingly balanced finale.  This is the best DIPA we’ve had in recent memory, and it is sips uniquely as a true east/west hybrid on the transition from the front of the mouth to the back.  We said it once, and we’ll say it again…BOOM. 3,216 charactersTheBrewo, Feb 10, 2015

4.26/5  rDev -4.5%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Canned on 1/10/2015. Poured into a nonic pint glass. 
The head is impressive. It's two fingers of fluffy, pale white foam that resembles clouds. It persists exceptionally well and leaves abundant lace. As for the body it's a blend of amber and gold that is slightly hazy at its upper parts, but clear and blonde closer to the base of the glass. 4.75
Piney, resinous and dank on the nose. Hints of citrus and berries but really very much more resinous. A sweet caramel base is noticeable too. 4.25
I'm surprised by a big floral flavor that is much more in line with what I'd expect from a Belgian, very much like fresh lilies. This is accompanied by a resinous, hop oil and fresh hop leafy flavor before a sweet and mildly citrus finish. It has currents of sweet maltiness offering some caramel and there's a nice interplay of flavors here, as each sip seems to offer a different twist. 4.25
Abrasive is apt for how this beer assaults the mouth. It's bitter almost throughout and not in a mellow way, it really bites at the tongue. There's a refreshing element initially, but it gets pretty thick and creamy before a dry and bitter finish. Carbonation is low to medium and works with the bitterness to really punish the tongue. 4
Besides being overly bitter for my poor taste buds, this is a damn good brew. The more masochistic of IPA/DIPA drinkers would probably love this. 1,379 charactersONovoMexicano, Feb 09, 2015

look-color is a bright, clear copper, pours two fingers of white, sticky head that retains beautify. constant stream of bubbles rise to the surface reinforcing the head.
Smell-lots of fruit going on, tropical notes of mango and pineapple, followed by apples, pears, slight floral character, a bit of toffee in the end.
Taste-Like the smell, lots of fruit going on. mango,pineapple, apples, tangerines, blended with subtle malty sweetness providing balance. no bitterness or booze whatsoever.
Feel-Creamy upfront, then goes pretty crisp with medium carbonation, finishes juicy and yet has a touch of satisfying dryness to it.
Overall-a perfect DIPA. superb. 661 charactersSteveB24, Feb 06, 2015

4.23/5  rDev -5.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.25Poured from a pint canned on 1/13/15 into an IPA glass. Appreciated over 35 remarkable minutes.
Produces a full two-finger head with good retention and appealing clumps of shave-soapy lacing. Hazy flat amber allows sufficient light through to read. Squadrons of small bubbles feed the head, leaving an airy cream cap on the core. It looks the part, but could have a more interesting show.
The nose is assertively bitter, oniony, and almost ammoniac in its way of dumping a tropical bounty in the nostrils. Smells make one see the color orange reflected by mangoes, peaches, papayas, and passion fruit. After some time in the glass, the sharp antiseptic resins flow away, leaving pineapple juice, saltine, and a touch of lime with those mounds of equatorial produce. Even later, the onion-cellar and sauerkraut overlay returns with the petrol of a used wine barrel; it’s unique, but not necessarily inviting.
The slick of hop oils delays the flavor explosion in cool wetness for a refreshing downbeat. Then, the juicy fruits take over. Papaya and passionfruit are stronger on the tongue than in the nose; mangoes come in a fraction later and fold downward into a lightly toasted and buttered biscuit on the back of the tongue midway through a swallow. At that point, there’s a surprising upward lift of freshness that suspends dusty earth and a nasally-sensed brush of pine that keeps bitterness in check and makes the aftertaste clean and enjoyable. There’s not much depth with a gangly, but rubbery and flexible backbone of malt designed primarily to wave the Citra flag. As it warms, the buzz of ethanol has more influence (right around the time that I can also feel that 9% in my head).
In the mouth, every phase feels right. Although I typically like more heft and chew in a DIPA, the body is properly matched to the hop and carbohydrate profile. Because it’s thinner, some floral phenolic notes of flavor dance on the tongue between gulps in a way that adds complexity to the otherwise humulenic focus. Early, the bubbles make a play, but they fade fast and leave organics to dominate the texture. If I could have just a bit more carbonation in the middle before the clean lift of bitter alpha acids, I’d give this element a perfect rating.
Despite the blast of Citra on the front end with tropical warmth in this winter release, I think the fresh, long ending and aftertaste are my favorite elements in the brew. It’s lively and large, but could use a touch more barley to ground and integrate its bitter angles and splashy fruits. Food fills that need quite nicely, though. The appellation doesn’t really fit this iteration of Abrasive, but buy it up and drink deeply! It’s a winner…again. 2,719 characters1sophrosyne1, Feb 01, 2015

L- One finger white head, looks slightly undercarbed but I heard this batch of Abrasive was this way, medium amber, good clarity.
S- Tons and tons of mango, pineapple, and peach, some light dankness and a sort of overall bubblegummy fruitiness. Definitely the most tropical smelling beer I've ever had thanks to what must be tons of Citra hops used in this beer. 
T- Follows the aroma, lots of mango, papaya, little less pineapple than in the nose, medium bitterness that doesn't hang on the palette, only a slight taste of the alcohol, nice level of sweetness.
F- A full mouthfeel that is like a thin syrup reminiscent of fruit nectar.  
O- From the moment I cracked the can and the tropical smell hit me in the face I knew I would love this beer. It is the most concentrated expression of Citra hops that I have had yet and really one of those beers you just want to sit and smell and it almost pains you to have to drink it cause it will be gone. It's right up there with Heady for me as one  of the best DIPAs and a beer I will certainly trade for every year now. 1,122 charactersPaulyB83, Jan 31, 2015

More citrus in flavor, with resin, and the a moderate bitterness.
Tried this again more sober, and a fresher beer. While I still find the bitterness to be a bit astringent and overwhelming, the pine, resin, and citrus are intriguing. Still put off by onion in aroma, but far better than initially rated. 368 charactersbarczar, Jan 31, 2015

Looks almost amber in color with a nice two finger head that lingers.
Smell is what I dream about!  Citrus hops and tropical fruit.  I wanted to just keep inhaling, but I had to know how it tasted.
Taste is grapefruit and tropical hops that finish with a classic IPA bitterness.
Feel is medium and crisp.  The hop resins leave my mouth coated in delicious hoppiness.
Overall, a great DIPA.  Definitely on my short list as one of the best I've had. 511 charactersmr-jj, Oct 17, 2014

Holy cloudiness. Looks like there is a lot of suspended yeast in the body. Excellent malty hop aroma. Pretty tasty. Very thick mouthfeel. Lots of hop flavors. Citrus lemony taste is strong. Some malt taste comes through, but I get more sweetness from the aroma than the taste. 298 characterskkleu357, Sep 16, 2014

A - From what I could see, very pale color and hazy.
S - Scents of sweet citrus, flowers, and freshly-baled hay dominate. A bit of tropical fruit, too.
T - Kumquat, grass, and a unique earthy spice flavor. Balanced by a hearty biscuity semi-dry malt backbone. Bits of tropical fruit and pine sneak in, too. The finish is bitter and pleasantly boozey.
M - Great, full mouthfeel and superbly carbonated. 
O - Aside from the fact the can looks like more like an energy drink than a world class beer, this brew is top-notch. My friends and I did a blind taste test of Abrasive versus Heady Topper and fully expected the Alchemist's DIPA to win - even though the HT was an admittedly 2 months old. Abrasive wiped the floor. Worth a visit to Minnesota just for this brew! 803 charactersporter_collie, Jun 13, 2014

Bright, golden colored body is a hazy and full of fine, white sediment. Soft, white head with lackluster retention. No noticeable carbonation, but the sediment could be hiding it. Nice lacing.
Aroma:
Sweet tangerine and hibiscus dominate here with other, subtle tropical fruits hidden under a thin blanket of pine. 
Taste:
Buttered biscuits coated in sweet, peach jam. Honey. Hoppy grapefruit finish with a hint of alcohol on the aftertaste.
Mouthfeel:
Incredibly smooth and easy to drink with a nice bite on the finish. Creamy. Lightly carbonated medum body. Clean, semi-sweet finish.
Overall:
Aother stellar beer from the folks at Surly! Any IPA fan would be silly to not add this to their must-have list. 723 charactersalphagnome, Jun 08, 2014

4.26/5  rDev -4.5%look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25APPEARANCE: Thick, hazy, orange in color. A gorgeous white head rests on top with the first pour, but fades into a thin cap fairly quickly. The bubbles that can be seen through the opaque haziness are slow moving , but plentiful. The lacing is rather nice, covering about 60% of the backside of the glass with big, splotchy layers.
SMELL: There is a ton of fruit on the nose here. Orange peel, apricot and a lot of pineapple. Behind all that fruit, however, is a nice, grassy backbone. Great smell.
TASTE: The orange from the nose is still present, but not as sweet. It blends into a slight grapefruit flavor that is supported by a big, grassy taste. There is some malt to balance, but this is not a sweet beer, not nearly as sweet as the aroma would have suggested. Instead, it is a downright, in your face, bitter beer...and it is lovely. A good dose of anise chimes in towards the end of each sip to tie everything together and wrap it up.
MOUTHFEEL: The carbonation provides a light tickle, which pairs well with a surprisingly light body for such a flavorful beer.
OVERALL: I don't compare a lot of beers to Stone Ruination, but this one deserves it. It is simply a very well done, intentionally bitter beer for people who love hops...and I love hops, so thanks Surly. 1,277 charactersStoneTSR, May 21, 2014

If you want an IPA with intense flavor, this is it, if you want an IPA that has bitterness that doesn't overpower the rest of the notes and flavors inside, this one is it, if you want a beer that makes you feel damn good as you're having it, as well as when you're done, this is it. 
I would classify this as a grapefruit IPA, I prefer piney IPAs, but in the end, this one still wins at the end of the day, if there is an elite example of the style, this is it. 602 characterspaladinjoe, Apr 28, 2014

A - Looks good. Hazy hues of light orange/golden copper with particles suspended in the brew.
S - Smells of sweet and juicy citrus, with solid hints of hops and pine.
M - Medium weight and medium carbonation.
T - Tropical citrus up front with dry piney bitterness at the end of each drink. No alcohol taste. Dry.
O - A great DIPA. Up there with PtE and Heady. This is a very good all-around DIPA that is a contender. 
This DIPA rivals the best of them. Depending on the day, it would take the top spot in my book. 530 charactersmabermud, Apr 27, 2014

Nearly opaque murky golden with 1 finger head, aroma of a bitter citrus fruit perhaps grapefruit. Aroma contained hints of musk or mildew (again this is not to be a negative reflection on the beer only my experience with this past its prime version, if anyone wants to send me a fresh version I would embrace with open arms :). 
Taste was smooth from front to back, balanced hops all the way through, lingering citrus on the tail. 
mouthfeel was smooth, with little to no carbonation.
Overall you can tell this is a top notch beer and I think I am going to have a higher rating for this beer in the future. 731 charactersbryanbullock, Mar 30, 2014

Pours a very hazy light amber color. Lots of sediment floating around in there. Smell is delicious even if it is an aged can. Lots of citrus, grapefruit rind, tons of hoppiness. Taste is just as good, but also has a malty sweetness to it that is very well balanced. Great DIPA! 368 charactershops202, Mar 30, 2014

What a beautiful pour! The body is a rich golden-honey color with the tiniest tinge of amber, and with a thick, foamy head that's easily 3". It's astoundingly well carbonated for how high its ABV is, and small particles remain suspended throughout - though somehow the beer isn't cloudy at all. It slowly fades to a decent soap bubble consistency, and never completely goes away. The beer smells suprisingly mild for what you'd expect - hops dominate, but they don't overpower, and they're on a backbone that smells suspiciously like really good cookie dough. It's no stronger-smelling than a regular IPA/APA, despite the much higher ABV.
The flavor is a mildly biscuity, not too complex vehicle that delivers a two-trailer 18-wheeler of hop resin down your throat. The hops themselves are very well balanced, and don't hit you in the face with a mallet like other popular DIPAs do - I'm not sure what strain they are, but the flavor and odor is difficult to describe beyond "balanced". The alcohol itself lends a lot to the flavor profile in a good way, which is rare for most beers I've had. The beer itself isn't terribly bitter either, almost juicy, and the yeast is as undetectable as a nuclear submarine.
The mouthfeel is something I'm not a fan of. The sticky hop resin coats the entire inside of your mouth and dries it out with alarming force, to the point that it makes it harder to taste and appreciate the rest of the beer. The aftertaste, on the other hand, is delightful and endlessly complex - even better than the core flavor itself. At alternating intervals as I drank this, I detected lingering notes as far off as juniper, grapefruit, lemon zest, maplewood sawdust, hash, macaroons, and cinnamon.
Overall, this is a world class DIPA precisely because it doesn't over-reach itself - Surly is all about hops, but even more so, I have yet to have a single beer of theirs that isn't expertly well-balanced. I'm fascinated by the contrast between how basic and occasionally unexciting the core flavor is, compared to the explosive rainbow of scents and flavors that stay in your mouth long after you've swallowed it. 2,169 charactersSirwootalot, Mar 29, 2014

4.44/5  rDev -0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5An abrasive is a substance used for polishing; Abrasive Ale, funny enough, is a very polished beer indeed. Its ripe banana peel colour has a blinding shine (despite a foggy complexion). Though its head isn't especially impressive the lacing it leaves sure is; this glass is tighter wrapped in cotton-like blanketing than a newborn. 
With American Double IPAs you usually know what you're getting; the hops are unmistakable. The wild card is what kind of hoppiness you'll find (tropical, herbal, floral, etc). This one I'd file under 'earthy': it has a fairly 'catty' scent and plenty of greenness. It smells like someone just plucked an entire tree branch of its leaves to sauté with white onions.
Abrasive drinks remarkably like grapefruit juice - it's like someone freshly squeezed it just now. Also, while I don't see any orange zest I sure as hell taste it. None of this citrus is particularly bitter or pithy mind you, and it's accompanied by smoothing traces of pine and spruce resins. The aftertaste also provides a little caramelized sugar to sweeten all that grapefruit. 
You'd have to ring your tongue out like a wet cloth to shake all the citrusy hoppiness afterwords; flavours don't just stop at the aftertaste, they continue on. Fantastic. Trade or do whatever it takes to get your hands on this one, but do it the proper justice and ensure it's a fresh sample; this may be a big beer but the style doesn't take wonderfully to aging. 
Surly Abrasive falls under the category of beers that need to be experienced to be fully appreciated. Words cannot even begin to explain the pleasure of drinking such a vibrantly hoppy and balanced DIPA. This is unbelievably approachable and quaffable for a beer with its specs (9%, 120 IBU). It's a DIPA that eclipses even many of my previous favourites. Simply great stuff. 1,828 charactersbiegaman, Mar 25, 2014

4.42/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25Big thanks for my buddy Ryan for throwing this in as an extra in a trade! Canned on 1/13/14.
Served in a willi becher pint glass, this beer shows off a bold golden hue that is saturated with little floating particles and rising bubbles. The head creates a sea foam-like head that is crisp white, and that leaves scarred lacing as the beer retreats in the glass.
It possesses a powerful aroma that pops out of the glass, filled with citrus (grapefruit) and tropical fruit (honeydew and mango). It smells sweet, juicy, dank, and just slightly oniony. The alcohol is there, but faintly in the background. Very hop forward and there isn't much in the way of a malt aroma.
The flavor is smooth, with a bitterness that coats the tongue and lasts through the finish. It hits the palate with citrus rind and herbaceous hops, and the malt and alcohol give a fruity impression towards the end. Medium to full-bodied. Medium carbonation. 
A very good double IPA. I would drink this again anytime. The flavor and aroma are powerful and juicy, and it hits the perfect mark that people are generally looking for in a DIPA/IPA. The alcohol is under control, and the hops are fully featured here. Is it better than Heady Topper? (My buddy prefers this to HT...) I'm not convinced. Give me a couple more cans and I'll find out. 1,314 charactersMusicaleMike, Mar 18, 2014

Others have said it reminds them of Heady Topper - I wish I hadn't read that before tasting, because I want to believe I would have discerned it myself. Regardless, a great double IPA. 
My palate tends toward the sweeter - to me, the Platonic ideal of the double IPA is Hopslam. This is not Hopslam - it is nice, balanced, and refreshing, but it retains more bitterness at the finish. 421 charactersschris, Mar 13, 2014

S - Smell is very good citrus. Grape fruit and tangerine if I had to put a name to it. A little bit of of grassy / dank backing.
T - Smell follows the nose. Alot of the citrus smells come through in the taste. Not overwhelming hop bitterness, it's balance quite nicely with a sweetish malty backbone.
M - Silky tingling mouthfeel. Best I can recall in an IPA.
O - Very good IPA. A notch below my faves such as elder and Citra DIPA, but very good.
Cheers to Lightsaber for the trade.
Note: I had this beer just before a hopslam. The hopslam did not make me change my ratings on this beer. 669 charactersWolberjs, Mar 12, 2014

HOPS! Groves of citrus, grapefruit, tangerine reside in a pine forest. As assertive as the hops start it is impossible not to notice the sweet caramel malt base. This malt creates the allusion of a balanced beer, which not everybody wants in the style. I appreciate the depth the malt adds, just as I enjoy the candied fruit notes too. This is a terrific smelling DIPA! 
HOPS! The same tangerine, grapefruit and citrus smack the taste buds. It’s a blunt attack, softened by a candied fruitiness only to exhale pine notes. The sweet maltiness proves the platform to springboard this great depth of hops. I really enjoy this beer every time I get the chance to try it. 
A bit more than medium in body and modest carbonation create a solid mouthfeel.
A totally delicious and crushable DIPA! Yet another jewel in the Surly crown. It is a must purchase anytime in see it in a store or on-tap. I recommend you do the same. 1,114 charactersbditty187, Mar 08, 2014

Pours slightly hazy, with an odd suspension of clearish floaters, making it a little bit hazy. Medium to big white head, nice retention. Medium carbonation. Smell is strong -- arm's length strong. Nice combination of piney and fruity, some floweriness. Very nice.
Taste is very hoppy. Lots of bitter pine, just enough malt to hold it up. Some floral, not so tropical fruity, some kind of creamy flavor.
Mouthfeel is full, slightly dry, interestingly rich or creamy. Overall, very good.

Lordy this smells good. Fills the room with aroma. This beer is clear, contrary to the previous review. I'd call it prettier, but lacking a bit in head. It's delicious. 862 characterssnaotheus, Mar 08, 2014

A: Pours a nice golden color with one finger head that dissipates to a nice film on the top. Seeing lots of carbonation hanging around and very nice lacing.
S: Initially lots of fruity citrus and pine followed by the "cat piss" smell
T: Lots of resiny pine and some of the citrus flavor. Strong malt backbone finish.

Smell is awesome tons of bright citrus tropical fruit hops forward with a little bite of piney resin tossed in there too. Smells like a double moon man to me, really bright vibrant hop aromas. Nothing else is even worth mentioning,the hops are what it's all about here.
Taste is equally awesome. It follows the note. Tons of tropical fruit and citrus fruit hops forward. So much so that the bright crisp flavors last through the entirety of the sip swallow aftertaste and I'm even burping fruit. Piney resin is lighter but still present and bitterness is there but not overpowering, it really let the hops shine. Malt is grainy and semi sweet but again, it's all about the hops here.
Mouthfeel is incredible. I've never had an ipa like this before. There so much hop oils and resin that my tounge instantly goes numb on contact. But sticky mouth coating oils and resin let the hop flavors and aroma dominate the entirety of the beer. Moderate carbonation and a light body help soften the aggressive hops and it ends up being pretty well balanced. 1,199 charactersFcolle2, Mar 07, 2014

Not sure if I overpaid or not, but happy to be able to try it! Canned 1/14/14, so 6 weeks at the time of review. From my experience, cans hold up much better than bottles in the IPA world, so I decided to give it a go anyways. 
A: Drinking this guy from the can, some other like-beer says to do so on the can, and I've just gotten in that habit now. 
S: Strong citrus with this one. Very tempting and well balanced. 
T: This has loads of citrus flavor punching through the 9% ABV. Even at 6 weeks old this has a crazy good flavor profile. Based off other reviews and hype I believe it has dropped off a bit, but I'm still a big fan. 
M: There's a nice crisp bitter finish that balances out the citrus and sweetness in the flavor. Very drinkable at a higher ABV. 
O: Thoroughly enjoyed. I've had some of the BA top IPAs with less age and enjoyed much less than this.
**edit. Had this a handful of times since original review. I am upgrading the ratings as it has certainly been more consistently better than the first time I reviewed. Aroma is more more potent, and flavor, and at a couple months plus from canning, is still bursting with flavor. 1,206 charactersroger617, Mar 02, 2014

Overall a fantastic IIPA. First time I've tried this - got lucky with the last 4 pack from Binnys. Given the price point (18 for 4 pints) its not something I'd pick up regularly (not like I could anyway) but prob something I'd try to pick up at least once a year.

Just think tropical, mango, peach, pineapple, and orangey citrus notes literally blow your tongue away.
Mouthfeel is sweet, sticky, and balanced with crisp bitter, perfect for an DIPA.

Smelling this pour is like tearing open a grapefruit like a gorilla. About some of the best grapefruit smell since fresh Flower Power. Staying with this awhile it begins to morph into a bag-o-weed and as they say (cat piss). But then again, it's just part of this euphoric experience.
Taste is just as elating as the aroma. This has a strong malt backbone substantiating the dank hoppiness. Strong earthy pine and hop cone. Semi-sweet with less prominent fruit structure.
Creamy texture and hop numbing layering on the tongue. Staying power.
This is a tremendously tremendous ale---bar none! This is high powered octane to get drunk quick. The pricing on this will always be in question for me. Like Sculpin, which is fantastic in its own right, I was curious of the hype but can't see paying the higher cost associated and I have not bought any since then and tis a shame. A lot of fantastic ales competing out here, no doubt. ABV on Abrasive is substantiate to get you going well on any pre-flight for the night. Sad to say that @ apx 20$/4pk, I just can't pull the trigger in the future. My curiosity has been quenched as I had an extra 20 in my pocket yesterday. Really though, not to be missed in your lifetime if you love quality and a good buzz on. Tremendously tremendous!!! 1,403 charactersjoeseppy, Feb 28, 2014

Appearance: Very hazy, Light golden orange color. Eggshell white head.
Smell: Waves of grapefruit and orange peel. Very citrusy with some herbal and flowery notes underneath.
Taste: Huge citra hops up front with some bitterness. Can definitely taste the alcohol.
Mouthfeel: Smooth with just enough carbonation. Kind of thin for how hazy it looks
Overall: I really like this beer, Surly did a very good job. I do however prefer there Furious a little bit more because of the availability and drinkabilty. (but it's not a DIPA) I look forward to drinking this when it's available. 642 characterslanciloti, Feb 27, 2014

S - Hoppy and malty - More pine than citrus.
T - Hops and malt intense, sweet up front with earthy finish. Slightly bitter aftertaste. Can't taste the alcohol. 
M - A little thick and heavy compared to taste. 
O - A really good beer, however I didn't like this as much as other BA 100 rated IIPA's. Also, not sure if I can see this being that much better than Surly's Furious APA, which is about $8 less per 4 pack. Was it really good, yes. Will I drink it again, certainly. Would I rate it as high as Pliny or Zombie, definitely not. Surly delivers many fine beers and intrigues me along the way. I will continue to try whatever they offer. -Prost! 736 charactersBowers-Brew, Feb 23, 2014

A: Pours a slightly hazy dark orange. Nice, two finger eggshell head. Stays at one finger for awhile. There is a bit of sediment visible and lots of carbonation bubbling to the surface.
S: I could smell this one even upon cracking the can. Really, really strong waves of grapefruit and orange. Extremely citrusy with some herbal and flowery notes underneath. 
T: Strong citrus flavor follows into the taste, too. Huge Citra hop taste. Lots of blood orange and grapefruit. Bit of grass and marijuana gives the hops a bit of depth. Pretty strong bready malt taste underneath the hops. Finishes slightly bitter and fruity.
M: Extremely smooth...no fuss at all going down. 9% is well hidden. Enough carbonation to give it some liveliness. 
O: One of the top 5 DIPAs out there. Loads of fresh citrus hop flavor, but there are enough things going on to keep it from getting boring. 928 charactersTTAmod, Feb 23, 2014

Canned on 1/21/14
Appearance - Hazy golden honey. 3 fingers of fluffy, foamy head. Thick lacing.
Smell - Tons of grapefruit. Tangerine. Little bit of floral as well. 
Taste - HUGE citra flavor, along with some pine and a really nice bitter bite. Very smooth. Toasty malt backbone that holds it all together. I can't find a single flaw in the taste. Solid 5. 
Mouthfeel - Med/heavy body, medium carbonation, dry finish.
Overall - The 2014 batch is out of this world. The minor details like appearance barely matter here. The taste is a solid 5/5. If you love big citrusy DIPAs, get a 4pk of this as soon as possible. 658 characterssbxx, Feb 21, 2014

Original review, 2014:
Awesome; looks great, smells amazing, and tastes even better. One of my top 4 DIPAs (IIPA by New Glarus, early 2013 Navaja, this, and Permanent Funeral by FFF.).
11/7/2016 edit: Now that I've had a few more citra-hopped beers (and by a few, I mean a million), I'm dropping this one down a little. It's a great beer, but it's more bitter than I'd like, and there are other citra beers that do that portion better (to my taste). 579 charactersSeanBond, Feb 19, 2014

Date: Canned 2014-01-07
Glass: Tulip
An excellent DIPA that manages to blend seriously bitter, hop-armpit like aromas and flavors with tropical fruits and base malt sweetness to come out with something surprisingly delicious and drinkable. While the tallboy can is a bit too much for one of these beers, this is an offering I would partake of often if it was local and/or affordable.
Pours a 1.5cm tall head of slightly off-white colored foam, made up of small-sized bubbles yielding a frothy appearance, which fades within 1.5 minutes to a thin ring around the perimeter of the glass and a small island of thin lace atop the body of the beer. Lacing is very good, with complex patterns clinging to all sides of the glass. Body is a bright, but deep, golden orange color, with light bringing out rich golden yellow to light golden orange hues. Carbonation visible through the slightly hazy (10-20% opacity) body: low in number, moderate in activity.
Aroma of hoppy BO, bitter grapefruit and orange, guava, pineapple, a bit of musky/musty/sweet tropical fruit that clearly shows the Citra hops, and a bit of spicy ethanol.
Flavor is highly of bitter hops, with flavors of bitter grapefruit, pineapple, guava, and hoppy BO. Front of palate tastes bitter hops with a bit of pine, dried grass, grapefruit, orange, guava, hoppy BO flavors, and mild background sweetness. Mid-palate of bitter grapefruit and orange, guava, pineapple, and a tropical fruit sweetness that's enhanced by the base pale and caramel-like malt sugars and light ethanol. Back of palate tastes high hop bitterness with some orange, grapefruit, and guava flavors along with a mild tropical fruit-like sweetness and very light ethanol. Aftertaste of bitter hops with attendant grapefruit, hoppy BO, and modest ethanol.
Beer is medium-bodied, with carbonation of medium-low intensity, leading to a lightly foamy (1/5) mouthfeel that is otherwise smooth, appropriate for a fairly ethanol-filled, strongly-flavored double IPA. Ethanol is only lightly detectable as gentle heat in the nostrils, no burnging on the palate or throat. Closes dry, with medium-heavy stickiness clinging to the palate. 2,195 charactersfalloutsnow, Feb 18, 2014

4.6/5  rDev +3.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5This beer is consistently fantastic. The pour is a hazy honey orange with an off white head that fades to subtle lacing and carbonation throughout. Wow the smell bright orange grapefruit citrus with a dank balance and a slight peachy yeast aroma. The taste hits all the aromas perfectly balanced not overly sweet bitter or citrus but does lean toward the citrus side. The taste is near perfect but I do think Pliny and ht are slightly deeper and fuller. The mouthfeel is crisp and full and you want to keep going back to the well for another.

Appearance: beer is a hazy dark golden color. Plenty of suspended sediment which just looks awesome. Half a finger of head on the pour which was present while drinking. 
Smell: Once the can is opened there is an explosion of floral hops. Once in the glass there are still plenty of bright tropical hop aromas but a solid malt body joins which adds a slightly nutty presence. The fruitiness of mangos, tangerines, kiwis, and pineapple just doesn't give in throughout. 
Taste: As one would expect, a bountiful bouquet of citrus sweetness on the front. The hop presence has such a soft feeling on the palate yet packs such a huge punch. Some of that nutty malt warms up the body a bit and can be felt into the aftertaste. But like the aroma, no doubt the floral hops dominate and man is it good. 
Mouthfeel: The hops showcase themselves so well without being taxing on the palate. Sweetness sticks around long after drinking.
Overall: Without a doubt one of the best IPAs I've ever had. I would only say its true rival that I've had to this point is HT. The floral hop tones are literally perfect and everything I love about an IPA. The malt body provides a perfect base for the hops to shine and dominate this brew. All I have is wow, a masterpiece. 1,266 charactersKFBR392, Jan 31, 2014

I have had it side by side with Bell's Hop slam (which is also a great beer) and would take Abrasive over it every time. It just sucks it is only available for a few months a year. 299 charactersjwerner23, Jan 29, 2014

A: Pours a murky honey orange in color with light to moderate amounts of active visible carbonation rising from the bottom of the glass and some hints of golden yellow and orange highlights. The beer has a two finger tall dense foamy off-white head that slowly reduces to a large thick cap covering the majority of the surface of the beer with a thin film surrounding it and a thick ring at the edges of the glass. Significant amounts of lacing are observed.
S: Strong aromas of citrus/grapefruit, citrus/orange, citrus/tangerine, and tropical/passionfruit hops - this beer has a huge hoppy aroma that is quite delicious.
T: Upfront there is a lightly honey sweet moderate grainy malt flavor that provide just enough sweetness to balance out the huge hop flavors. Strong flavors of citrus/grapefruit, citrus/orange, and citrus/tangerine hops with moderate flavors of tropical/passionfruit and tropical/pineapple hops. Light to moderate amounts of lingering bitterness.
M: Slightly heavier than medium bodied with moderate amounts of carbonation. Chewy and slightly sticky with a touch of dryness in the finish.
O: Definitely one of the most enjoyable DIPA that I have had the chance to drink - very enjoyable with huge fruity hop flavors and well hidden alcohol. Easy to drink and very enjoyable. 1,377 charactersdbrauneis, Jan 26, 2014

Aroma is a hop medley of mangoes, peach, bright orange citrus and gren notes that are more grassy than piney. Underlying sweetness that blends with the fruit hops providing balance without much of a combating bready or grainy aroma.
Sweet caramel and toasty malt provides balance to a pleasant pine and deeper orange citrus flavor with rich nectarine and peach notes. Finish lacks drying qualities despite the expected DIPA bitterness but provides a slight alcohol taste with a sweet cracker malt dusting. 
Moderate body, with a very rich and creamy mouthfeel, tight bubbles that are neither prickly or overbearing. Alcohol note is reserved but present and the malt is a bit sticky. Drying comes in late as the bitterness sticks to the palate.
Wow, I took two of these down before I knew what hit me. The aroma and mouthfeel are text book, the aroma encompasses a variety of luscious hop smells and the drink is very smooth. Taste is unique with the stone fruit flavors atop plentiful pine and citrus. 
Thanks to my new friend maximum12 for this one. Can you call someone you traded with just once a friend? After a few of these..I think you have to. 1,297 charactersrawfish, Jan 21, 2014

Really nice looking beer, dark orange color with a half finger head and minimal lace. Aroma is a little muted for me. I get some orange, piney hops. I find it somewhere in between a citrus and pine bomb. Taste is fruity and tasty upfront with some malt and pine in between and then a huge hop bomb aftertaste and pretty dry. I also get a little candyish pez type taste. Almost reminds me of Palate Wrecker but with more fruit characteristics. Mouthfeel is semi carbonated and bitter rolling off the palate. Overall this is an excellent DIPA but not quite World Class in my opinion. As it warms it really shines. I would definitely seek this out and love to try one that's fresh as hell to better compare. Even so, another great one from Surly. 811 charactersrjp217, Jan 18, 2014

S-The nose is a damp Citra aroma. Peaches, pineapples, citrus bouquet, grass, moss and pine. The aromatic intensity is slightly softer than I'd hoped but the actual aroma is splendid.
T-The flavor is simply delicious. The combination of Citra and Warrior hops deliver the full spectrum of tropical fruits. Really tastes like nectarines. Like pure peach and nectarine flesh. The hops just pour on the flavor; and it's varied. Grass and pine and marijuana to back the Edible Arrangement of tropical flavors. The malt gives me a pleasant animal cracker backing which is tasty in its own right. 
M-High bitterness. Oily hop resins. Medium carbonation, maybe even on the low side. Hints of alcohol. Very drinkable. 
O/D-This lived up to the hype for me. It's hop expression is just to my liking. I will be looking for more of this next time its brewed. An elite, top tier beer. It gets better as it warms. 1,102 charactersVelvetExtract, Dec 31, 2013

Poured from a 16 oz can into a CBS snifter. Served chilled...
A) Golden Amber brew with a slight haze. This had a nice foamy white head, that slowly settled to dusting. A good amount of lacing.
S) Quite aromatic as soon as you crack the can. Not quite as intense as Heady, but reminiscent of that experience. Initially some tropical fruit sweetness, then some dank ass hops. This is good... Very good...
T) Yeah, this is getting it done. I love drinking Furious, but this is on another level. The name almost would imply a lack of balance, but this comes together wonderfully. I mean, it's a hop bomb, but a little caramel sweetness and tropical fruit bring it all together. The alcohol is amazingly well hidden. This shit is impressive.
M) Heavier medium to full bodied beer, with lighter carbonation. The finish is semi-dry and definitely hoppy. Goes down easy... So easy...
O) I've got some grievances to voice here. 1) Surly should send their beer to Wisconsin pronto. 2) This should be available year round. 1,055 charactersRoamingGnome, Dec 29, 2013

A - Hazy golden with an orange hue. White cap of head. Tons of sticky lacing.
S - Resiny pine hops from the moment the can was cracked. The citrus notes are softer, cascade-like. Mild sweetness from a neutral grainy base malt.
T - Hop resins hit immediately. These hops give off strong pine hop flavors and drown out all malts. The assertive bitterness lasts quite a bit after finishing but is right in style. 
M - Medium to medium-full body, medium-light carbonation, dry. 
O - The lighter color makes this beer approachable but is hop dominant for sure. I really enjoyed this brew.

S- Big hops bitterness is the first and the last flavor in this scent. Hops are mostly floral with some citrus notes intermingling. The biggest impression I get from the scent here is just a hint of fruity sweetness, but also a bit of stickiness.
T- Starting off, this beer displays the same floral hops bitterness as in the scent. Moderately to aggressively bitter, the hops dominate most of the drink. There is a little bit of an appearance by citrus flavors among the hops, mostly of the pineapple variety. Ends with the lingering bitterness of the hops that were present throughout.
M- Smooth and a littler thicker than most IPA/DIPA's. Lower in the carbonation department. Not terribly palate wrecking, so it can be drank fairly easily.
Overall, an amped up, and higher quality, double version of Furious I think. The citrus/pineapple flavor in the scent/taste is somewhat unique and interesting. 1,113 charactersboilermakerbrew, Dec 27, 2013

4.25/5  rDev -4.7%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25The aroma here is all hops, all the time. I don't get any notes of malt at all. Pine, citrus, resiny....sharply hoppy on the nose. I don't think there's any question this beer is going to be a bitter one.
This is a brilliantly hoppy beer taste wise, no question. Huge notes of citrus and pine as well. But for all the huge hop flavor, I wouldn't say it is really all that bitter. Sure, it'll blow most people away who aren't used to craft beer, but I don't find this to be a completely astringent hop bomb that's unpleasurable to drink. The flavors are there, but I don't have to pucker or make a face when drinking it....and to me, that is a mark of a good DIPA. 
The other interesting thing is that I do get a bit of a taste of the sweet malt backbone to this beer....so it isn't totally absent. Of course it's definitely in the shadow of the hops as you may imagine but it is present. And the finish?? Fairly clean. Notes of citric hops present...but nothing lingering really. And that's just the way I like a beer like this to end. 
Honestly, I had some trepidation about this one at first perhaps just because of the name. But it isn't abrasive at all. It's just Furious on steroids....but still delicious. Not a total one sided hop bomb at all. 1,253 charactersNODAK, Dec 26, 2013

Smell - lots of citrus; mainly grapefruit and apricot. Piney hops. As it warmed, the bready malt becomes more apparent. 
Taste - Is very similar to the smell, but the malt is more noticeable. Hop bomb with grapefruit, apricot, and a bit of grass. Caramel malts. Pretty balanced but it leans more towards the hop side than the malt side. Hop bitterness on the finish
Mouthfeel - Medium amount of carbonation and a slight hint of heat from the 9% abv. Juicy / sticky finish.
Overall - I'm a huge a fan of this beer and being from MN, I'm fortunate enough to have easy access to this. Just wish Surly would make available it year round. 818 charactersshadetree67, Dec 24, 2013

4.17/5  rDev -6.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25Poured from a can packed on 10/30 into a Dogfish Head IPA glass. The pour is a hazy, dingy, medium-orange honey-gold with a rocky coarse white head. Nice level of carbonation and even a few floaties. The nose is dank and hoppy, with grapefruit, pine trees, and floral notes. Not really what I would call a ``citrus bomb'', but definitely a good sniffer.
The beer has a balanced, though hoppy flavor and a wonderful, slick feel. Sweet bready notes up front are quickly accompanied by ripe and bitter grapefruit, lemon, grass, pine, and a hint of pineapple sweetness. Everything is well balanced in this beer. It's one of those IIPAs that doesn't seem nearly as bitter as it really is. Moreover, I cannot detect the alcohol in this beer at all. It's nothing but great hop and malt flavor. Not what I would consider to be ``citrusy'', although there are some citrus notes in it. It's more of an ``all over the map'' bitterness. I definitely get the warrior and citra hops, but I could almost swear it has some centennial as well (I checked - it doesn't. So much for my fool of a palate).
A classic IIPA, and deservedly so. I've had Surly Furious, and wasn't that impressed with it (who knows - perhaps I just had a bad can), but this one is definitely a keeper. Very pleasant, intense hop flavors, but not so bitter as to detract from the drinking enjoyment. Terrific IIPA. 1,372 charactersdeadonhisfeet, Dec 18, 2013

Surly Brewing Company, Minnesota
---from can to stemmed tulip glass---
Appearance
Hazy honey orange with three fingers of ivory head that just will not go away! Lovely floating yeast particles. Good lacing.
Smell
Grapefruit, pineapple, mango, pear, very little evidence of malt… 
Taste
Total citrus bomb! Sweet and slightly syrupy at first. Builds to a good bitter. Tart grapefruit and pine is left lingering… sweet caramel malts are present only enough to say that they are present. 
Mouth-feel
Medium body. Great bitter. Good carbonation. Tantalizing ale right here!
Overall
Wow. Very good. 9% ABV is not evident at all. Very juicy and bitter… I could drink this again and again… in fact, number 2 is being opened right now. Best Double IPA I’ve had. Very refreshing and drinkable! 811 charactersKevin-Wieken, Dec 18, 2013

Appearance: Hazy 24K golden yellow with a thick two finger dense foam which leaves a clingy lace on the glass as it descends.
Smell: Huge piney hop and grapefruit, rounding out with guava. I get a whiff of sweet malt as well. I'm really in love with this smell of this one.
Taste: Velvety smooth, tropical and hoppy with little alcohol presence. Finishes with a pleasing bitterness that seems to ramp up well after you've dispatched the gulp. 
Mouthfeel: Medium carbonation with a smooth, slick feel that coats the mouth. 
Overall: Thanks to Pintofbrown for sending this in his beer swap. Hands down, the best DIPA I've had. Very well made and balanced. 676 charactersdarthvohn, Dec 17, 2013

A: Pours a hazy orange-tinged golden with 1 finger of off-white bubbly head. Copious hoppiness evidenced by haze of floaties, giving the look of an intensely juicy IPA.
S: Overwhelming hop notes of pine, but mostly citrus. Juicy grapefruit alongside notes of pineapple or perhaps guava -- super juicy smelling. A nice mild dank hoppy character provides a strong undertone for the aroma of this beer. Mild malt sweetness, but a significant second to the fresh hop aromas.
T/M: Starts with a smooth and juicy texture that rapidly intensifies with hop bitterness. Juicy and earthy tropical fruit flavor up front leads into a slight malt sweetness that complements the citrus well. A slight prickly carbonation and medium mouthfeel isn't overbearing, but doesn't underserve this beer. The finish is a strong hop bitterness and a slight hint of alcohol.
O: This is a great hoppy beer, truly juicy with citrusy hop character. Abrasive really showcases its hops wonderfully, giving room for pine, grapefruit, and other tropical fruit character to step up over an appropriate but not overwhelming malt backbone. Maybe slightly more bittering on the finish than I would like, but definitely not overdone. Really a solid beer that I'd be happy to have again. 1,302 charactersjdhowe, Dec 14, 2013

4.82/5  rDev +8.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Thanks amerak! One of my all time wants, at last. Poured out of a 16oz can into a tulip glass. Canning date is listed at the bottom as "11/05/13."
Pours a cloudy (floatie filled) amber orange that looks a lot a blended juice of sorts. Contains a nice 3-finger high foamy head that settles down while leaving a good amount of stickiness. Every time I'd swirl the glass a ton of droplets would stick around for some time. This is really oily stuff, and I can tell right off the bat that this is going to be an intense flavor filled experience.
The aroma is undeniably dank, as far as DIPAs go - huge classic Surly pine notes, alongside an assortment of bittered fruitiness. Grapefruit, peaches, apricots, and guava. Not as tropical as other people make it out to be, but still a grand, seemingly fresh squeezed citrus rank of an experience. Contains a solid amount of toffee and caramel that adds a sweetened, balanced texture to the monstrous addition of hops. In terms of comparing to other DIPAs, this really does rival Heady Topper. I'm going to do a side by side comparison and see how this pans out. For the time being, this is really delightful, intense stuff.
The flavor is pretty much another win for Surly - for Christ's sake, talk about a beer that gets everything I love about various hoppy beers of different styles and brings them all together. My favorite moments of ZD, PtE, and HT, among several others I love, all come together in a rather exasperating manner. At first, there's the obvious notes of pine, which meld into a fresh-squeezed equivalent of grapefruit juice right away. Indeed, the can conditioned texture of the beer make this more reminiscent to juice in more ways I could ask for. Adding on to the initial grapefruit flavor, notes of peaches, apricots, mangoes, guava, pineapple, cantaloupe, and lime make their way through in a truly graceful, balanced manner. The toffee and pear at the finish is a wonderful, refreshing way of topping out the final touches from the complexity in the aftertaste. As for the finish? Amazing stuff - makes the beer unique in its own right. At my first sip, I simply thought, "oh, grapefruit and dried pine. Nice." But then, the aftertaste of the tropical, resinous hop oils melt at the back of the tongue brilliantly with the toffee, which not only cleanses the palate, but physically leaves you immediately wanting more. Thick, creamy, and juicy. Nothing needs to be improved here.
Sweet Jesus, how do the guys at Surly make hoppy beers of this caliber? This feels so much like a West Coast IPA or a Midwestern hoppy variety in so many respects, but it blows most offerings in the country out of the water. Refreshing, complex, food friendly, and rewarding stuff. At the low price and decent availability, I wonder if I should just stick to getting more of these from now on than any other beer of its type not in my distro. I really wish this were year-round. World class. 2,943 charactersmagictacosinus, Dec 12, 2013

T- I'll take the easy way out and say same as the nose. This beer is freakin tasty!
M- sticky, perfect carbonation, medium bodied
O- The best DIPA I've had by far (yet to try pliny or heady though) I wish this beer was cheaper at $15.99 a 4 pk 16oz cans but I am very glad I tried it. 552 charactersBeerNutz324, Dec 11, 2013

A: Awesome amber golden colored ale with great lacing. Looks wonderful
S: Awesome hoppy smells with citrusy fruits that become more and more prevalent as it opens up
T: Tropical fruits hops, amazing taste that is definitely in my top 5 DIPA's… maybe my favorite over heady definitely will have to be tracking this down again… 
M: Medium in body with a low to moderate carbonation 
O : Have only had this and Darkness from Surly and I am so surprised and amazed at the quality and deliciousness of their beers…. will be tracking this down again
Have furious and coffee bender on the way!
Edit: Even at 2 and a half months old this beer is still fantastic.
Have now had roughly 12 cans of this and definitely want more. 808 charactersdrmcleod10, Dec 07, 2013

Smell is definitely nice and fruity -- grapefruit, orange, and a little pineapple is what I am getting from the nose. Smells really nice. Taste some nice malts in the background. Definitely a hop forward beer with tastes much like the nose. I'm surprised when I'm thinking critically about the beer that I am getting the malts in the background. Definitely a hop forward beer but there is a really nice balance with the malts I really never noticed before for this IIPA. I don't want to overstate the malts. really not balanced but there are some in the background that are definitely noticeable. Mouthfeel is thicker than most IIPAs but this really makes it a treat. Overall this is a great beer that I always look forward to and was really happy it came early this year. 887 charactersNeedBeerHere, Dec 07, 2013

After reading all the glowing reviews and loving Furious for so long I figured it was time.
Canned on 11/15/13, very fresh!!
A- Pours a nice glowing golden hue with a bit of cloudiness to it, maybe a finger of fine white foam that dissipated quickly.
S- Ah yes, a bright burst of citrus and pine, I could smell that all day!! You can just tell it will taste good by how damn fresh and floral it is!
T- Yeah, it is delicious, hits the front of the tongue with a slight bitterness that quickly gives way to a perfect balance of hops and citrus and a smooth follow through down the back of the throat, very drinkable and deceptive at 9%. 
M- Not much to say other than...really friken good!
O- The whole experience with this beer is quite great. It is top 3 easy for any lover of the strong IPA's! I really enjoy breathing in the smell as I drink it out of my trusted tulip vessel.
Top notch Surly, in a state with crap for sports teams at least we have a "winner" with you! 1,042 charactershomersimpson67, Nov 28, 2013

T - Hell yes! Hops all over my mouth. This is 9%? So easy to drink. Big citrus and tons of bitter grapefruit. A light honey/caramel sweetness makes a brief appearance in the middle and the finish is bitter pine.

The aroma is of a sweet citrus combo, (pineapple, grapefruit, predominantly), and a hint of pine.
The taste is WOW! Similar to smell...up front citrus sweetness, followed by a dry, pine bitterness. The bitterness is not overpowering...nicely balanced. Medium body, and carbonation. ABV is 9%, but not even noticeable.
Incredible beer. 473 charactersTCMike, Nov 23, 2013

A - Deep orange with a nice reddish hue on this one. Nice eggshell white head with decent retention. Fair lacing.
S - ... It really doesn't get much better than this. This is one of the most potent, dank, resinous, hop-forward beers I've ever smelled. Getting a fair amount of pine, big citrus and mild floral notes. Definitely some marijuana qualities as well.
T - Extends beautifully from the smell. Tropical citrus hits you up front with a sweetness which immediate turns into a dry piney bitterness at the end of the sip which lingers for what seems like forever. It begs you to take another sip. No alcohol taste whatsoever.
M - Oily resinous mouthfeel with a medium body. The malt definitely takes a backseat here, but isn't completely hidden to help balance out the absurd amount of hops.
O - One of the best I've ever had without a doubt; a hop-head's holy grail. Seek this one out, I know I will be in the future. 974 charactersDemoniChris, Nov 17, 2013

I love beer from cans, I really do. There is just something about cracking open the top that just allows the aroma to gush out of the opening. The only beer I have been completely floored from in terms of aroma was Heady Topper, which coincidentally was from a can. Well consider me floored from yet another DIPA from a can!
Not gonna go on about appearance. Who reads that part anyway? It looks rad. There, said it.
Great Odin's Raven!
Smells like liquid ambrosia. Fo' real. Dank hops, juicy citrus, hint of garlic that all badass DIPAs have. Yeah, this puts hair on my chest. And just in time for the winter too!
Flavor is EXACTLY the same as the aroma...jizztastic. So flavorful and possessing no alcohol burn what so ever. Honestly, with all of the 6% beers that have WAY too much alcohol presence, this is 9% and as smooth as a baby's bottom.
Honestly, this is just as good as Heady. I have had 2 day old Heady, as well as 2 month old Heady and I can tell a big change in its flavor and aroma. At 3 weeks, I have a feeling that at 2 days old it would even be better than that 2 day old Heady. 
Where was I going with that monologue? Can't say for sure. What I can say, though, is that this is in the top 3 DIPA I have ever had, beside Heady and Double Sunshine. A true work of art and yet another Surly beer to turn me even more into a fan.
Cheers! 1,410 charactersironchefmiyagi13, Nov 15, 2013

Very nice lacing. The aroma on this beer is outstanding - tropical fruit, citrus, cantaloupe, resinous pine, lemon, with a hint of breadiness. Bitterness throughout with faint caramel notes mid palate that finishes very dry with a touch of honeyed sweetness on the tongue. Mouthfeel is oily, with a medium-light body and decent carbonation. Overall, a very well crafted DIPA that sits among the pantheon of the finest DIPAs. 529 charactersJohnG190, Nov 14, 2013

Canned on 10/30/2013 - Enjoyed on 11/14/2013
Oh my God.
Upon cracking open the aluminum containment vessel, there's an aroma that speaks with the voice of some Holy deity, 'this, my son, is going to be good' - imagine the scent of a fresh bottle of orange juice with with twice the sex appeal.
The color is a gorgeous yellow orange, carbonation is pleasant but not too much. A previous reviewer nailed it when he mentioned how the juicy citrus grabs your tongue off the get-go, then gives way to a Hopgasm. That was paraphrasing. Mouthfeel is dangerous. It's like extra viscous water, but juicier. So juicy. The alcohol really only presents itself once you swallow. This ale leaves my tongue a little dry but my cheeks are oozing right now.
Overall this is probably the most high class IPA 'experience' I've ever had. I have to note, however, that on most day's I'd rather have a beer than an 'experience'. For the money I'd reach for a Summit Sága or a Lucid Foto, but if you're looking for a rare treat, you've come to the right place with this beer. I paid way too much for this one but had a gift card and really wanted to put my lips to something with a ba score of 100 - and this was my first time getting to do that. I don't think I'd spend that money on this beer again - like I said though, this was for the experience. I may drink one more then trade the other 2 in the 4pack for some heady if that's possible.
*EDIT*: After consuming, this can left me seriously craving another, which I allowed myself, and drank straight from the can. This seems important - upon imbibing of second pint, I was left feeling that there was too much fruitiness going on with this beer. I don't take back any praise, this is an awesome IPA, but part of me thinks I'm becoming more of a stout guy. 1,991 charactersHop-Droppen-Roll, Nov 14, 2013

64oz Growler
I got this treat in a recent trade from the Mad Minnesotan, mully. Thanks for the hook up Matt! 16 Grit fills up my Goose Island willi glass with a hazy tangerine orange IIPA that has a tendency to glow the reddish orange of a sunset when backlit. Arch-like bone white lacing graces the glass as the two finger head settles to a solid cap. The lacing will take some scrubbing to remove from the glass, it's nice and sticky.
This IPA has a crazy amount of flowery hop qualities. Orange and tangy tangerines hold their own but flowery hoppiness leads the way. All I can smell when I bury my nose in the glass is a field of in bloom flowers. There's a touch of pine in the back but it stays put and struggles to get through the perfumey hops. The malty backbone is oozing caramel but be sure; this is a hopcentric brew without a doubt. As my glass warms the tangerines become a little more pronounced and there's a strong showing of honey. The nose is a little leathery, resinous, maybe even some tobacco. If the aroma is any indication this is one hugely complex hoppy beer.
The flavor does not disappoint. While there's a lot of hops tossed into this brew it's in no way a tongue scrubber with the bitterness. The tangerine and orange grab the tongue first but quickly give it up to the floral, resinous, pine needle hoppiness that lingers throughout. Sweet tangerine and orange oils pop back up on the swallow. Throughout each drink the leather and tobacco make appearances here and there. All of this incredible hoppy goodness sits atop a solid, sweet caramel malty base. This is an interesting IIPA to say the least with a ton of unique flavors and a hop profile unlike any other.
The mouthfeel is right where it should be. Medium body with an active enough carbonation to keep things moving while being slow enough to let me grasp every flavor involved. The bitterness lingers on the middle of my tongue and never fully lets go. A little snap across the tongue finishes things off.
I'm not sure of the abv in this brew but there is zero noticeable alcohol. The first pint disappeared so quick it's scary and the hops, while bitter, aren't assertive enough to keep me from getting the most out of each glass.
16 Grit is high quality! A growler of this isn't enough and hopefully we see some cans in the near future. There's so much hop complexity to this brew that it's a beer to sit down and think about while drinking, which is rare for IPAs. Thanks for this excellent IIPA Matt!

The color is a deep amber orange with a big 2-3 finger fluffy head that slowly dissipates leaving some lacing.
The aroma punches of sweet peaches, oranges, red grapefruit, some resinous qualities and even a touch of garlic dankness. 
On the flavor, a hint of candy sweetness comes first. Then onto lots of grapefruit pith, grapefruit flesh, tropical passionfruit, mangoes. Then onto a grassy, and resinous finish. The beer extremely clean with a medium bitterness. 551 charactersdar482, Jul 12, 2013

A: Pours a clear orange color forming a light yellow bubbled big head. Medium retention and lots of molasses lacings left in the glass
S: Strong caramel and caramel malts in the nose. Interesting "something else" here. Maybe honey or some spice. A bit of alcohol and tons of flowery and citruses hops
T: Slightly sweet caramel upfront. A bit fruity too. Which is followed by a dry and bitter hoppy taste. Hops are herbal and citrus too. A bit fruity. In overall, I would say, perfect!
M: Medium to heavy body. Molasses. Medium carbonation and a delicious bittersweet aftertaste
O: Excellent drinkability. Absolutely great IIPA. Perfect 674 characterseduardolinhalis, Jun 19, 2013

This one kicks you in the mouth with the amount of Hops. Slightly bitter when you first taste it but a very smooth finish. Recommend trying this one in-season, as it seems to go stale fairly quickly. 282 characterssita3081, May 09, 2013

Appearance: A light copper color in appearance with a strong off-white head (for this ABV). Retains well.
Smell: Piney, resinous hops upfront with a touch of citrus, especially grapefruit. The resin notes dominate at this point, but I remember my first can having more citrus notes, so it is probably the age taking some away.
Taste: The taste is a nice pine bomb up front which is well balanced by the malt. This is not syrupy or sweet like some DIPAs, it is a hop showcase. A little grapefruit on the finish but at this point, as with the smell, it is mostly piney/resinous.
Mouthfeel: Superb. The head on this is really spectacular. Microbubble awesome foamy head that is one of the most stand out parts of this DIPA. I love this!
Overall: Awesome DIPA. I was not a fan of other Surly offerings, but this one really earns it's reputation. I am looking forward to getting more of it next year! 945 charactersrboinski, May 08, 2013

A - Pours a hazy orange, great two/three fingers of head that dissipates somewhat quickly, great lacing.
S - Sweet resiny smell. Some earthy notes in there for sure, a little pineyness. Light hop smell relatively, also has some hints of tropical fruit towards the end of the nose.
T - A punchy wave of flavors blast the palate. Bitter earth tones, pine, and citrus notes all dance around. Taste was on point.
M - Changes flavor across the palate. Good carbonation, aftertaste somewhat lingers, but in a good way.
O - Great beer, leaves me wanting to try all the other Surly brews! This is a DIPA that I could have multiples of. 715 charactersda_beers, May 08, 2013

A - Pours a very hazy, speckeley golden yellow with a creamy 3 finger ivory colored head. A nice ring of lacing is left behind when it fades.
S - Woah! The smell fills the room as soon as I pop the can. Great citrus smells of lemon zest, and some trpical fruits like mango and papaya. One of the best smelling DIPAs I've ever smelled.
T/M - The taste really matches the smell nicely! Great juicy tropical fruits on the front, a nice caramel malt middle, and a fresh lemon zest back. Really great hop bitterness aftertaste (which I love!). Medium mouthfeel, great carbonation.
O - This is the perfect example of what a DIPA should be. Mouthfeel isn't too light, hops take center stage, great resinous aftertaste. Great great great all around. If I could get this in Vegas, I would stock up a healthy suply. But I can't, so a huge thanks to jeremy for hooking me up with this gem. Cheers to you bro! 990 charactersRizalini, May 04, 2013

I get only about one inch of head that fades in just a couple of minutes. Head is a soft beige in color. Only edges of lace are left behind. Nose is full of orange rind and marmalade. Softly fragrant but very nice. With first sip I am really taken by how dry this beer is. Based on the nose I was really expecting something a little more citrus based and maybe a bit sweater. Not that I am complaining but the nose threw me off. The hop profile is nicely bitter and extremely dry. There is a twinge of lemon zest on the on the back end of the palate. This beer is not heavy at all and would go wonderfully with some stinky blue cheese. Dryness lingers on the mouthfeel but is just wonderful. A very nice break from all the more sweet IPAs out there lately. 851 charactersSPLITGRIN, May 02, 2013

I have beer trading to thank for this one and a few other Surly brews.
Look - Slightly hazy but mostly clear bubbly golden. Nice frothy head. Lacing abound.
Smell - Intense deep resinous hop bomb with malt overtones. Beast mode!
Taste - Pucker blast of hops. Resiny, piney, citrus, the whole shebang. Malt heavy as well but it lines up quite well.
Mouthfeel - Super hop citrus feel rests, the initial resin blast fades. Not too boozy. Good drinkability.
Overall - Phenomenal contender with the rest of the DIPA crew. This brew is for serious hop heads. Others are likely to cringe or cry. 631 charactersJMScowcroft, May 01, 2013

Smell is very pleasant. Piney, floral, and grapefruity citrus. It's a big smell, but not the biggest Ive ever had. 
Wonderful flavor. Rich, medium sweetness, and complex. Notes of pine, grapefruit peel, resin. The flavor is very earthy. Definitely high bitterness, but somehow easily manageable. 
Medium-low carbonation with medium-low MF. Very resinous feel after each sip. A puckering dryness coats the mouth.
I like this beer a lot. It definitely strikes the chords as "abrasive." I tend to like a little sweeter and brighter IIPAs, but nonetheless I have to hand it to Surly. They hit their intended mark with this beer right on the head. 812 characterslunarbrew, Apr 28, 2013

A - pours a fairly cloudy marigold color into a big bulb wine glass. Looks like a hazy round sun on a clear day. Around a fingers worth of pearly white foam on top which quickly dissipates.
S - the nose is thick, sticky, piny and dank. Resinous. Sort of like the sap stuck on pine needles or pollen on flowers. And lots of tropical fruit. Delicate notes of pineapple, mango, passion fruit and meyer lemon.
T - at first blush there is a honey malt character. Which almost immediately gets dominated by notes of snappy bitter citrus and resin. Notes of pine. Tropical fruit adds to the sweet honey malt flavors. The finish is sweet with hints of fruit and pine.
M - interesting texture. The beer seems crisp because of the intense hop character but its actually on the creamy side. Medium bodied with high tight bubbled carbonation.
 O - an excellent ale. Just one of the finest dipas i have ever had the pleasure of trying. 942 charactersTeleweizen2, Apr 28, 2013

S: When I opened this car, the first thing I got is that intense citrus and hoppy smell! After taking my time to savor the aroma of it, I could begin to pick up some honey from it. Great balance to it via my olfactory system!
T: Definitely a hop-forward taste...could begin to taste some of that honey, pine, and grapefruit. It continues to overwhelm my taste buds while they're screaming for more....bitterness taste comes through at the end and left me yearning for more when I'm done with it.
M: Medium body, and none of that malt-tasting that you would get from other DIPAs. Sorta of light taste but still come through with its punch in the mouth. Somewhat similar to Hopslam but the bitterness flavor takes over that and start to feel balanced at the end.
O: Wow, this is one of most under-hyped beers and I'm glad folks keep it that way...for now. I can see why it continues to receive 100% score from people and it's right up at the top...even better than Hopslam at the elite level. It's all about the citrus and bitterness flavor. If you prefer a malt-forward or sorta "barleywine" DIPA, don't waste your time trying this beer. Okay, do try this beer if you haven't done so because it has the power to convert you! Kudos to Surly Brewing Company. 1,310 characterscw577enfield, Apr 25, 2013

4.27/5  rDev -4.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Pours a nice golden/straw color with a big fluffy white head. Healthy carbonation. Looks inviting enough.
Smell is big citrus upfront, and a lingering smell that I can't fully define. It's pleasant, but I can't quite put my finger on it. Big picture though, this is a whole lot of citrus, very in your face, and I love it. 
Taste is all sorts of hops and citrus upfront. No real malt presence to speak of. The name of the beer aside, it doesn't come across as hard to drink despite the big flavor notes. Finishes with a good bit of bitterness but nothing astringent. Complex? Not really, but if you are looking for a big hop/citrus bomb, this is it.
Moutfeel is about right for the style. Resiny, a little syrupy, but ultimately enough carbonation to give a nice sense or body and drink smoothly.
Overall this is a well made hop bomb of a beer. If that's your thing, this beer is worth a shot. In the realm of Pliny's, Hopslams, Heady Toppers, Pure Hoppiness and the like, does this beer hold up? It's in the conversation, but ultimately I couldn't say i'd put this beer ahead of any of those (my old ratings aside)... but if its a step down from those it is a very minor one. In the end, there is something to be said for a beer that delivers exactly what it promises. 1,273 charactersmechamifune, Apr 12, 2013
4.21/5  rDev -5.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Canned 02-28-13, sampled 04-12-13.
Pours a clear, dark golden yellow color with a medium sized off-white head of bubbly foam that had decent head retention which subsided to leave some thick, sticky, rings of lacing on the glass.
Aromas begin with super tropical fruits combined with lesser grapefruit and pine hops. There is a mild sweetish, candy malt backbone but really not much worth mentioning even as it warms.
The tastes begin with the lightly sweet, toasted maltiness immediately overcome by astrigent grapefruit and complementary tropical fruity hops. There are some lesser spicy and dank pine hops in the background 
The mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation. Finish is mainly dry and bitter but by no means "abrasive" as the label indicates. 
Overall I enjoyed this but sadly not as much as it's lighter cousin Furious. I don't think over a month is a death sentence for a DIPA but maybe a fresher example would have yielded a more impressive aroma. While this is a world class example of the style, I still found the price point a bit high. The flavor profile is super amazing, but nothing that hasn't been done before. With all the new hop styles available it seems you need to reinvent yourself to be continuously impressive to induce repeat purchases. If it was easier to get I would probably purchase again but for close to half the cost, Furious is more drinkable and sessionable and probably easier to get on the daily. 1,456 charactersclaspada, Apr 11, 2013

4.67/5  rDev +4.7%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.7516oz tallboy canned 3/4/2013, poured into a Bell's tulip glass and quaffed today 4/8/13 after my beloved Wolverines lost in the national title game.
Aroma: As soon as I popped the can, I got hit in the face with tropical fruit, citrus and pine. Very hard to miss and extremely dense nose. That could be from the can's small opening, but still, as soon as it was all in the glass, it was still very strong. There is also some honey and bready sweetness in the background. Very good hopforward nose. (4.5)
Colour: Beautiful, hazy amber body with a thick, dense 3cm white head that stays for a minute or two before dissipating into a persistent thin white film and thick white collar. The lacing is sticking all over the glass such that by the end, there are tons of it. Really good looking beer that makes me smile and want to drink it. (4.75)
Flavour: Really good stuff. I get a lot of the pine hopforwardness up front that quickly transitions to a honeyed, bready sweetness and then that gets overcome by citrus bitterness remniscent of grapefruit and some ripe oranges leaving me with a clean, dry and very bitter finish. Definitely not a balanced DIPA as its extremely hopforward, I suppose I'd call it abrasive if my palate weren't attuned to DIPAs, but I certainly prefer a little bit more balance to it. I get no heat at all, which contributes to its quaffability. (4.75)
Mouthfeel: Outstanding. A medium body, very resinous and dry. The carbonation is fantastic- its resinous but fizzes like crazy on my tongue. A true pleasure to quaff. The aftertaste is a very citrusy, pineapply bitter one that definitely wrecks my palate. I'm pretty damn sure I'm not going to taste anything if I drink another beer after this. When it comes to a hopforward DIPA, this is the one to rule them all. (4.5)
Overall: I see what all the hype is about. This is a really smooth drinking, hopforward double IPA that lives up to its name. It definitely hides its 9% ABV very well and is a delectable gobletful of citrus, tropical fruit and pine bitterness. If you're a huge hophead, this is a fantastic example of a beer you'll give all 5's to. For me, I think it could be a little bit more malty to back up the hops and it'd meet my preferences for a more balanced DIPA that I've come to love- such as Pliny the Elder and this year's Hopslam- both of which are on the sweeter side to go along with their hopforwardness. I would definitely get it every year as long as I live near Minnesota. (4.75) 2,488 charactersStevedore, Apr 09, 2013

I feel like it needs a bigger platform to stand out. carbonation is right on though, and it makes the grapefruit and other citrus hops characters come out a little more. id love to know what hops are used in this, its really different. Maybe not the most perfect example of the style out there, but you don't get to be a 100 on BA in this category by accident. Worthy of my anticipation, this is a stellar beer. I can still name a handful of others id draft higher, but this is awesome! 1,410 charactersStonedTrippin, Apr 08, 2013

4.31/5  rDev -3.4%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.25 |  overall: 4.25Poured from a 16oz tallboy can into an oversized wineglass. Canned on date of 030413 on bottom of can. SIngle pruchased by my brother Greg from a Minneapolis area bottle shop for $4.
A: Amber-orange with rocky, 2-finger off-white big-bubbled head with decent retention and several layers of lacing. 
S: The hop aroma jumps from the glass, detectable from 2-3 feet or so. Mango, pineapple, and passionfruit, a tropical fruit punch like aroma without the sugary sweetness. There is some grapefruit, pine, and resin too, but the fruity aromas win out. The malt component is pretty bland and background, as it shoudl be with a little bit of crackery malt character.
T: The flavor is a hair below the aroma in quality, but not enough to knock it down to the next score. The fruity hops assault continues with lashing pineapple, mango, pine, and grapefruit. The bitterness is more than I would have imagined and sneaks up on you throughout the can with a more resiney quality that grows to almost take over the flavor profile by the end. The malt component is again fairly simple with some light grain and cracker notes. I don't get any yeast character. The bitterness level is high.
M: The attenuation on this beer is so high, it drink too light to me -- there should be a little bit of lush malt body to match up, otherwise the bitterness and resiney qualities, which I like but with some balance, tend to take over. I think Abrasive pushes it without missing, but I would love to see a little more body -- it comes off a near-watery at points. The carbonation is understandably medium, but maybe it should even be a little lower to keep any astringency from poking through.
O: I really liked Surly Abrasive ale and was psyched to get a chance to try it. I don't think it is quite as good as some of the top-shelf, hop-forward DIPAs like PtE (which while dry still has some malt slickness to it), Hopslam (also dry from the honey but still with more heft than Abrasive), or Maharaja (which has come off as a little sweet in the past but was great this year). If they ramped up the mouthfeel a tad to give a little more body, this would be a top 10 DIPA. Still a great beer and definitely worth seeking out. 2,207 charactersargock, Apr 08, 2013

A: Cloudy amber liquid with 1/2" white head.

T: Like it smells: body odor, garlic and onions as well as earthy hop flavours.
M: Medium to thin viscosity and a medium level of carbonation.
O: I really dislike CTZ hops and I have a palate that picks up off flavours with beers that are heavily hopped with CTZ which is why I disliked this beer so much. 452 charactersDaftCaskBC, Apr 08, 2013

I enjoyed using the can for beer can chicken and unless I can find this beer on tap I will only use it when making a very hoppy beer can chicken and drink the left over of the 4 pack.
The appearance was first rate with a nice lacing when poured from the can into a glass.
The smell had a significant hoppyness and was as flowery as one would expect from a Great Douple IPA, however great IPAs are not from a can.
The taste was full and hppy and was as good as one would expect from a beer from a can.
I rate this beer a 5 in all catogories exept overall as it is in a can.
No amount of plastic lining in a can can compensate for a bottled beer.
I really want to like this beer and the brewery, but I can get as good or better beers in glass. I know cans are better for recycling, but anything is better in glass then cans. I would pay more for glass then cans, and craft beer is best in a bottle or a keg. NEVER a can. 996 charactersxmorgan, Apr 05, 2013

A: Hazy orange body with a thick, creamy 2+ finger head of creamsicle color, awesome retention and lacing.
S: Very aromatic, nice blend of a sweet malty backing with a hop medley that is mostly tropical fruits, mango, and peaches, with some citrus and a touch of pine.
T: Quite bitter from start to finish with a lingering bitterness on the aftertaste. Could have a little more hop flavor to it. You can tell theres a large malt backbone but it doesn't suffer from being overly sweet. Easy-drinking and hides the alcohol very well.
M: Definitely a high point with this brew. Into elite category with a medium to full body and creamy mouthfeel that makes each sip close to perfect.
O: Definitely an elite DIPA, and especially for the bitter-seekers. The mouthfeel makes it for me, it could be near perfect if the hop flavor was more present in the taste as it is in the nose. Definitely enjoyed though. 1,044 charactersMCain04, Apr 04, 2013

A: Pours a golden orange with a finger's worth of white head that takes its time dissipating into a thin halo with some superficial film on top. Nothing groundbreaking, but certainly solid.
S: Holy citrus. A ton of grapefruit and tropical fruits. This is one of my favorite smelling beers ever.
T: The taste mirrors the aroma. For a hoppy beer that's 75 days old, this has retained many of its original qualities. Fantastic.
M: There is no way I'd be able to pick up on the 9% ABV if I hadn't looked at the can first. Unbelievably drinkable and the delicious hoppiness lingers, inviting the drinker to have sip after sip.
O: On my Untappd check-in, I said "I will miss this beer" and it's true. I've had a few different offerings from Surly and have enjoyed them all, but Abrasive is definitely my favorite. Would love to try it on tap someday. Drink it if you can. 973 charactersAndrew61923, Apr 04, 2013

A- Nice fluffy one finger worth of head that lingered long. Great lacing and retention. 
S- Hops bite your nose with citrus and tropical fruit hints. 
T- Follows as the nose leads with citrus fruit punch and lingering pineapple and grapefruit. 
M- Lacks the syrupy feeling common in DIPA/IIPAs and not overly thick. Finishes very dry an attribute I love in the abrasive when compared to others brewed under the same manner. 
O- I wrote in my notes "Perfect" but this was not my first pint on this particular occasion but still rings pretty true. I love this ale. The bitterness hide the reasonably high abv Abrasive offers which needs to be taken into account since after only one or two is plenty for the consumer. The fact that this particular establishment served the Abrasive in pints and not smaller pours also could get people into trouble. Cheers. 928 charactersAndyP612, Apr 03, 2013

A- Pours a clear light orange color with a good finger and a half worth of a white colored head. The head slowly fades to some froth hanging on the sides of the glass. 
S- This beer smells awesome. Immediately upon popping the can I got hit with hop aroma. Grapefruit, citrus and pine dominate the smell. 
T- The smells carries over into the taste. The most prevalent hop presence is the piney resin taste. There is some slight citrus/mango/grapefruit, but the pine notes seem to dominate. Not much of a malt presence here, just hop domination. 
M- Well carbonated, medium bodied, hoppy and bitter with a very dry finish. The alcohol is well masked and this one is rather refreshing.

4.87/5  rDev +9.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Can brought to me from my mom in Minneapolis. 
This beer pours a beautiful amber golden color that is perfectly translucent with a smallish head but plenty of carbonation. 
The aroma is super strong hoppy. Tons and tons of piney aromas with biscuity notes of course. Not saying anything that hasn't been said. This is one of the finest smelling hoppy beers I've had, though. 
The taste is all hops; there is just enough malt to see this insane amount of hops through. The flavors are pine, pine, pine, with that little biscuit. In a good way. This is hop heaven. I can't identify specific hop characteristics too well, but this to me is on the piney side instead of the floral side. There is a great sweet note that comes through from the grains, which is strong and full-bodied, but doesn't dominate. One of the most amazing-tasting beers I've ever had. 
The feel comes in just perfectly. Perfectly clear and not too heavy. Totally drinkable for the style and strength. Amazing clarity for how huge of a beer it is. This beer has the flavor and body of a Dreadnaught or Arctic Panzer Wolf without the ABV (or price). I could drink one of these and be happy (thankfully I have 8 of them). 
I'd say this is up there with any DIPA I've had. If you're in Minnesota and this is available fresh, grab it whatever the price. 1,323 charactersaefbjo, Mar 28, 2013

A- Pours a medium amber color with a full two fingers worth of off-white head that retains decently showing soft bumps and thin webs as it travels down the glass. Eventually it resides at an 1/8 inch thick ring around the edge of the glass and a large bump in the center of the surface.
S- Enticingly floral hop aroma that's very musty and dank. Plenty of tropical fruit notes with sharp grapefruit, tangy lemon, tart peach plus a lot of wet grass.
T- Strikingly bitter but balanced with the malt enough to make it smooth even with the alcohol flavor being very apparent. Has an earthy aftertaste that's actually more enjoyable than the initial taste. Reminds me of leafy greens. Speaking of which, I get a slight cannabis note out of the overall profile. The tropical fruit is less apparent than in the aroma. 
M- Sharp and dry with a lingering hop bite. Medium carbonation and a somewhat light body.
O- I just checked my review for Furious that I wrote a week ago, and I gave it the exact same score as I am for this guy. The only main difference I find in these two is the Furious shows off the citrus characteristics a bit better whereas Abrasive is a bit more earthy and herbal which is a bit confusing since Furious uses Amarillo and Simcoe hops which are generally more earthy and Abrasive uses Citra (which is obviously more citrusy) and Warrior...Maybe I'm overthinking this and should just enjoy the beer.

4.57/5  rDev +2.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 16 oz can into a large wine glass. Canned 12/20/12. Acquired in a trade from FrostyWG, cheers!! Age wasn't ideal but I didn't have a huge say in the matter!
A: Light golden/orange, slightly cloudy, decent white head on pour but quick die off, ok lacing floating around on top afterwards
S: Fresh hops, light floral, but much more tropical hops I find... mango/pineapple sweetness, some light cider aroma, light on the citrus's...not so much pine resins...
T: Starts off again with tropical sweetness; more mango, pineapple and light malts start to come up, especially as it begins to warm, moves then into the more pine resin, pepper as others note, bitter grapefruit, and citrus peel in the after taste.
M: High carbonation, pretty balanced, only slightly dry and sticky, and only slightly boozy. 
O: While it obviously could be fresher, drinking 3 months old), you can tell this is a very excellent DIPA. I would say that the name Abrasive though is pretty fitting as the beer doesn't shy away from pounding your face with hops. That being said, it is well balanced, though a bit double headed. A nice balance between very tropical sweets and bitter citrus's. Very nice drinking beer as well, though I would say it is the slightest bit more harsh that Heady, the transition/blend not being as smooth, & the hops are more in your face and I don't quite get the same hop complexity I find in a Heady, also not quite as strong IBU it feels. (Again, could be the age... ) Looking forward to trying this fresh one day though and it certainly doesn't fade in the shadow of other hyped DIPA's.. 1,608 characters4ster, Mar 24, 2013

M-Smooth, cool, and dry, but not too dry. full.
Killer brew. Unique in that it's big, but not big in hop bouquet or taste bounty or diversity/saturation. It has its own interestingly bitter profile(onion, garlic, scallion) in comparison to Heady, Pliny, etc. It stands on its own, and I love that. 593 characterspatm1986, Mar 15, 2013

Pours clear orange hued gold with about two finger of pale head that leaves nice islands of lace. 
Smells of piney and tropical hops with a note of cracker and just a smidge of some metallic note. 
Flavor is a nice blend of orangey, mango, pine and pineapple hops with a nice bready/cracker sweet maltiness and touches of pepper, rind and lemon zest. The booze is quite subdued. 
Resinous, oily medium feel with moderate carbonation. Long, dry, bitter, slick finish. 
Not sure I'd give it quite the props that it gets from most but this is still a world class DIPA. Well balanced with a wonderful blend of hops and nice feel. I believe that I will try to get more in the future. 822 charactersThickNStout, Mar 11, 2013

A- Pours a orange unfiltered body with a gushy thick white head that reduces slowly to some chunky foam. Leaves uneven lacing. Awesome
S- the second opened this beer, a pungent tropical , grapefruit-pineapple, tangerine, piney aroma filled the air. Absolutely inviting!!
T- An intricate balance of juicy tropical notes and bitter, piney, resinous notes that go together quite well. Not cloyingly hoppy as the name suggests, quite balanced. Raw.
M- light and easy to drink, not a malt bomb. Medium- low carbonation.
World class balance and flavor, up there with the big boys. Definitely the best surly I've had so far and a must try for hop heads. 754 charactersgcamparone, Mar 03, 2013

It left acceptable lacing and retention in the glass. A big floral citrus aroma jumped from the glass, awakening the sense of smell. In the front, notes of peach, pineapple, apple came from the hops. A pleasant maltiness laid in the background as to not allow the hops to be overwhelming. The hops notes seem to unify in the end to a megahop that resembles grapefruit at its base in the aftertaste. Pleasantly warming notes are allowed to linger with thick texture helping the sensation to cling to the back of the throat. This is an excellent example of the style that I could drink any time. 692 charactersJohnnyHopps, Mar 01, 2013

A: Abrasive has a hazy yellow color, not that deep orange/amber color you see on some other DIPAs. Moderate carbonation bubbles slowly streaming up from the bottom of the glass. Poured with a solid 2 finger white head that went away pretty quickly. Some spotty lacing.
S: Smells absolutely incredible! When I opened the can I was immediately hit in the face with the hop aroma. I instantly thought of home brewing, the smell coming from the can smells like I just opened up a bag of cascade hop pellets. Unreal.
T: This can isn't super fresh, canned 11/14/12, and I'm reviewing it on 2/25/13. The initial taste is super citrusy, grapefruit and orange peel are what stand out most in my mind. Finishes with an overwhelming hop bitterness. The taste doesn't really live up to the nose, but I realize that this can isn't super fresh, so I'm really not that disappointed. I'm not one of those "this ipa is a week old! it's gone bad!!" guys, but I'd really love to try this beer more fresh in the future.
M: Creamy, on the heavy side of medium bodied. Nice carbonation.
O: Overall this is an outstanding DIPA, the only knock I gave it is the taste failing to live up to the nose. I've been a huge fan of all the Surly beers I've tried so far, and this did not disappoint. I've got family in Minnesota...maybe I need to plan a trip out there soon! 1,442 charactersbifrost17, Feb 26, 2013

A: Pours a hazy orange that you would expect from a great DIPA. With a brilliant white head, that leaves slightly lacing.
Smell: Bursting with grapefruit, pine, hops and other strong citrus scents.
Taste: Simply amazing, exploding with citrus and pine all over the place. The perfect balance of bitterness and sweetness with this one. Though the sweetness is more of a bittersweet. The taste lingers, but when it dissipates you want to go back for another sip immediately. Hides the 9% as if its nothing at all.
Mouthfeel: Very full, especially for a DIPA. Rather resiny, but in the best sense of the word. Slight carbonation.
Overall: This beer is absolutely amazing, hands down my favorite DIPA. Given it's drinkability, it's price and 2-4 month availability, this may actually be my favorite beer of all time. 865 charactersDaftPatrick, Feb 26, 2013

The smell is of strong, dank hops. The fruity citrusy smell is there, but the skunkier side is present as well. Taste is exactly how it smells. Quite good! Mouthfeel is a tad sticky, but not too much. Overall, it's a world class DIPA. A very strong beer(though a bit inconsistent in my experience). However, at 19 bucks a 4 pack, it also makes me want to say Kudos to the Alchemist/NEB and others for providing very similar beers for a lot less money. 572 charactersdougfur, Feb 23, 2013

4.79/5  rDev +7.4%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.75Thanks again to Mike for letting me split his last one with him. My first Surly IPA. Pours a copper-orange color exhibiting exceptional clarity all the way through. A big, white, foamy head piles up and stays perched atop the ale, leaving remnants of chunky lace all around the glass. Overall, very inviting and clean, especially for a DIPA. And of course, great head. Nothing worse than an IPA with no head.
And then I smelled it. Son of a bitch, this stuff smells excellent. As I bring my nose to the glass, a handful of citrus gets launched into my senses and sends me into utopia for a few moments. Pineapples, sweet grapefruits, mangoes, tangerines, and a large assortment of other various tropical fruits just reach out and run a number on my nostrils. The intense citrus is met in equal parts with one of the most raw, and down-n-dirty hop bills I've had the pleasure of smelling. Dank, super oily and resinous, wet, grassy, and full of pine needles. The hops here mean serious fucking business. Whatever they're doing over there at Surly - they're doing it right. 
After an aroma like that, how can this stuff not taste excellent? Right up front, the piney, resinous hops swim to every nook and cranny in my mouth and send a shockwave of bitterness through my system. The bitterness is lovely because it seems to hit powerfully and quick, then tapers off and lets the rest of the flavors work their magic - those would include the myriad of fruits I fell in love with a few moments ago. More citrus rind, pineapple, grapefruit peel, mango, tangerine: citric and tropical, all day!
A light peppery flavor works its way into things, along with very slight onion notes, keeping things interesting. The aftertaste leaves you feeling like you just took a mouth full of the freshest and most green grass on the planet. Grassy, leafy, super resinous aftertaste with one, little, dying bit of citrus peel and rind. The malt gives a light bread and cracker canvas for all of the hops to go to town on. After every sip, I am blown away by how awesome this beer is. Medium bodied, carbonated heavily; this one leaves a light stickiness across the palate.
Jesus, this stuff is sickeningly amazing. Some of the freshest tasting hop notes around, nice and bitter without being scary (don't be afraid of the name "Abrasive" - it's not so bad), and one of the best aromas in the business. The formula for success. Surly has it. It's called Abrasive. 2,445 characterstectactoe, Feb 20, 2013

A - Pours a worn penny copper color with a solid finger of off-white head. Near perfect clarity. Retention is excellent and it leaves a thick wall of lacing on the glass.
S - Citrus hits hard. Lactic grapefruit, sweet pineapple, and floral hops. Faint resinous pine and a honey-like malt backbone survive amongst the hop assault. 
T - There is a more aggressive pine flavor than was present in the nose. Some tang juice drink coupled with sourdough malts. Grapefruit and mango through the finish with a mildly bitter aftertaste. I am not sure if I buy the 120 IBU they claim, but it is certainly not mellow. 
M - A viscous, oily body, with good carbonation. Crisp and drying on the finish. 
O - There is a chance these cans were frozen in transit, but it is still a damn fine beer. Great citrus and tropical flavors with a bitter hop quality. Typically, DIPAs lean towards bitter or fruity, but this one is heavy on both. I enjoy it more as I drink. It is certainly one of the best in the style. I highly recommend it. 1,134 charactersNoLeafClover44, Feb 19, 2013

A: Light caramel colored with a substantial foam that’s resting in the neck of the tulip. Not really enough room to test the legs, and that’s OK.
 N: I can smell this from a foot away. Deep whiffs of pineapple, mango, and passionfruit. Some grapefruit, but leans more towards the tropical. Sticky crystallized sugar and a great base for the pine and earthiness. Tour de force, if a bit on the sweet side. 
T: Sticky, candied pineapples. More of the tropical mango and passionfruit. Very sweet, but it runs right along the boundary between cloying and just right, alternating between sips. There is that dank base that overloads the pine needles that I don’t much appreciate because it stings, but this is really, truly good in spite of a minor flaw. 
M: Very sticky. I’m not even sure what the body feels like because of the stickiness. Alcohol is quite evident.
O: For being a double IPA, this is more potent than some TIPAs I’ve had. Carries a pretty large stick to beat you over the head with, so if you’re in the mood for something rough, this’ll be perfectly abrasive. 1,132 charactersSarlacc83, Feb 18, 2013

A- pours slightly hazy orange with a two finger head
S- woah, tons of tropical fruits, sticky icky pine, hops, lemon, grapefruit, slightly bready.
T/M- as the nose, it's has tons of tropical favors, pine resin, citrus fruits, warm but crisp hops, amazingly smooth for 120ibus, great thickness
O- I was apprehensive that the hype would disappoint me, NOPE. This was as good as heady, just a little more tropical. Like heady, the texture is buttery and leaves your mouth demanding another sip. The alcohol and abv are very well hidden. I purchased this online and it was worth every penny, I can only imagine what it would be like a day or two old. Never pass the opportunity to drink this gem. 728 charactersbrewtus, Feb 17, 2013

4.98/5  rDev +11.7%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5Pours from my favorite style beer vessel a CAN, aka a mini keg, really deep orangish color with a slight haze to it, really nice looking
Smell is very fruity, Mango, orange, grapefuit and a little sweet malt in the background.
Tasts is amazing a lot of tropical and citrus fruit flavors come throu to start, then hits you with a huge bitterness that drys you up real nice and makes you want more and more!
Mouthfeel is a medium with a bitter dry finsih, I do like my DIPAs a wee bit thicker, but that is a small complaint in a otherwish flawless beer.
Wow here it is my favorite DIPA of all time so far... I live on the WI/MN border so I get it every once in a while but the $19/4 pack price tag makes it a very once in a while purchase. That being said if you have always wanted to try it at least this is one where the premium price matches the premium nectar inside! 873 charactersnickapalooza86, Feb 09, 2013

4.38/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Poured from can into some kind of glass, I don't know what you would call this thing. Flute? 
A: Pours a hazy orange color with a white, fluffy head that sticks around, and leaves some sexy lacing around the edge of the glass. It leaves a ring timestamp of how quickly you sip this beauty. The lacing is very impressive.
N: As soon as I pour out the can I get a big wave of sweet tropical fruit. Tangerine, orange, even some pineapple in there. There's a bit of resiny pine in the back, but it's definitely fruit forward. 
T: And the palate does not dissapoint. Just a big juice bomb. Orange character, with a bit of sweetness provided by a pineapple element, some tangerine, yet is firmly supported by a great hop bitternes. The malt bill isn't overbearing, and really lets this beautifully hopped elixir to shine.
M: There is a bit of sticky mouthfeel, but it's fairly short lived, and lively. There is a bit of that resiny hop sticking around on the back of the throat. 
D and O: This beer deserves every bit of praise it gets. It's an extremely well balanced, hop forward, DIPA. It's got a certain amount of dryness that plays well with the juicy hops. Just an awesome beer. 1,183 charactersMarcatGSB, Feb 07, 2013

Poured into Snifter glass. Minimal white head that quickly dissipated. Strong punch in the nose of pine, fruity /orange smell. Slight hint of "alcohol". Smells great.
Slightly hazy in appearance, with little to no lacing. Medium body/mouthfeel. Nice smooth bitter bite up front that transitions nicely to sweet, citrus finish. Slight caramel taste balanced nicely with hops works nicely with alcohol warmth. 
Very nice example of a Double IPA. Definitely in my top 5 as of now. 540 charactersPoopstainKilla, Feb 05, 2013

Canned 12/28/12 poured into GI tulip
Pour: A cloudy golden yellow-orange with a great 2 & 1/2 finger bright white head with tight small bubbles. Head retention is fleeting leaving a considerable amount of lacing. Carbonation is not very evident in the appearance.
Smell: Big punch of juicy citrus with grapefruit, pineapple, orange peel, lemon. There is also some resinous pine mixed in but I am getting a lot more of the citrus notes. I also get a caramel type sweetness that does seem to tame the hops in the nose some. This is one great smelling beer.
Taste: Now I find this interesting because I think the taste is a reverse of the nose. I get much more of the pine hops and the citrus taking a back seat. Quite bitter at the front of the tongue and then the citrus peeks through to even things out mid palate some. There is a slight sweetness also cutting the hop bitterness. This one finishes very dry and the alcohol is non existent. This is a hop lovers dream beer.
Mouthfeel: Carbonation makes itself known here with a rather high level but works ok in this beer as it does feel creamy but dry in the finish. This makes me pucker and primes me for the next sip almost immediately. I would call this medium bodied with a hidden alcohol taste.
Overall: This is my first experience with Surly and color me impressed! Damn fine example of a DIPA and one that I would love to have regular access to. 1,454 characterssleuthdog, Feb 02, 2013

Appearance: Medium to dark orange in color. Two finger creamy white head that holds really well and leaves a really spectacular lacing around the glass.
Aroma: Mango and grapefruit hop notes upfront. Some bitter pine notes in the background complement the sweetness from the hops and the background malt. Some light caramel from the malt background, which is definitely noticable but works well.
Taste: Pineapple, mango and a really nice tropical fruit tones upfront. Pretty nice, bitter grapefruit and pine. The hop notes are really juicy with plenty of bitterness. Really refreshing and easy to drink. The malt backdrop is really well done as well. Creates a great candied hop note as well. A really tasty IPA.
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, but manages to drink easy and stay refreshing. Some sharp carbonation.
Overall, a really awesome double IPA that is really juicy, hoppy and bitter. Drinks really easy for the ABV and doesn't feel bogged down or heavy at all. Feels mugh lighter than 9% ABV. I don't know if this is quite the level of the best IPA's I've ever had, but it is certainly impressive and more than worth the price. I'm glad I have a couple more cans to crack open soon. 1,291 charactersGosox8787, Feb 02, 2013

Poured from the can into a snifter as implied by the can
A - Exactly what I see in my mind when I think DIPA. Golden, slightly hazy color. A three finger head roils up, even with a careful pour, and its not going away quickly. Eventually it becomes a solid white filmy cap that leaves awesome stickage
S - Hop oil! Jesus Christ! I have never had a DIPA where the aroma is so close to the taste; you can taste it through aroma alone. Resinous piney grapefruit, rose water note, grassy, earthy: there is a lot going on. Perfumey
T - The hops are so present that it is almost as if it was dry-hopped hours ago. The alcohol is very well hidden and only comes through in the finish: quite rare for 9.0%. Floral notes abound as well as herbs, but the flavor is anchored by the earthy bitterness that may take hours to dissipate. This beer has a long semi-sweet finish, that just reminds me to grab another one from the fridge.
M - Very glossy on the tongue and palate. I feel like all of my taste buds have been bathed in fresh hop goodness. Surprisingly bright and light, which means scarily drinkable.
O - I got this via Haskells online and it is only 6 days old at this point. This could have something to do with how blown away I am, but I think this beer is a must try. I now have a reason to move to MN, but its the only one I can think of right now. 1,502 charactershopoilcrazy, Jan 31, 2013

Wonderful aroma of pine, tropical fruit, tangerines and grapefruit hoppiness on a background of caramel malt. Pours a coppery color with a good off white head. Taste is nice and bitter but still quite drinkable. Very resinous flavor. Too dry to be called a hop syrup but it’s a hop party. Mouthfeel is round without getting cloying. Hop oiliness abounds. Great beer. Edit: I had previously tried a growler of 16 Grit, but this review is from the can. 473 characterspopery, Jan 26, 2013

Pour: Mostly clear, deep orange, slightly copper body. A two finger cream colored head from, and leaves some very heavy lacing.
Smell: Big citrus and resinous pine up front. A light floral hoppiness. Big bready and caramel malts sweetness shows itself. Mostly, the citrus and pine hop qualities just own the nose.
Taste: Huge grapefruit and pine. Like sticking my head in an evergreen and dumping grapefruit puree on myself at the same time. Perfect with all that sap and juice, a sticky caramel sweetness bolsters the massive hop profile. Quite bitter. I wouldn't call it abrasively bitter, and that's okay with me. Finishes with a lingers citrus bitterness.
Mouthfeel: Pretty darn drinkable. No trace of abv, and the bitterness is quite manageable. Lingering juiciness and bitterness.
Overall: This definitely exceeded my expectations. Abrasive is no joke! Thanks Bennett. 937 characterscfrances33, Jan 26, 2013

S: A very citrus smell (pine tree like). Hoppy with a slight malt backbone.
T: Hop heaven! So much resin, a hop lovers dream.
M: Great, good carbonation and left a great hoppy aftertaste after each swallow.

At two weeks old I am excited to finally let Abrasive hop-whip me as it was meant to.
A - Pours a golden/orange hue with just hint of a haziness. A half-finger pillow of head holds on for a few minutes. Decent lacing. Looks awesome.
S - Wow. This is fantastic. Pointed grapefruit is what I'm getting foremost. Some resinous, sticky pine is right behind. A honey sweetness rounds it out. Near perfect for me.
T - Definitely one to enjoy slowly. Take more than a sip and you'll be assaulted by a bit too much bitterness. Solution, don't gulp. I actually enjoyed the season's first hopslam last week--the taste I'm getting out of this brew is much closer to what I had imagined I would get out the slam. The hops and sweetness are complex but almost perfectly balanced. I do not get any of the 9% abv, and the aftertaste is a blend both of piney hops and sweetness. Outstanding.
M - Perfectly stickythick. Medium-full body and perfect carbonation.
O - I really enjoyed this beer. I think this will be my go to first-quarter DIPA fix in the future. 1,074 charactersdlello2, Jan 24, 2013

Pours lightly hazy copper/amber with a two finger off-white head that leaves a ring of lacing and holds a light cap.
Aroma is pine, grassy, herbal hops, some grapefruit rind, a little dank & onion, a little musty, some bread and caramel malt. Good strength.
Flavor is big resinous hops, grapefruit rind, pine, some onion, big ass bitterness, some caramel malt, doesn’t do much against the, dare I say, abrasive nature of the bitterness here. Some alcohol, dry finish.
Mouthfeel is medium-plus bodied, oily, sticky, good carbonation.
Lives up to its name as far as the bitterness goes, and I like me a bitter bomb. A real treat to not only get to try this, but to get one that is very fresh. Big thanks to Mark! 803 characterselgiacomo, Jan 21, 2013

A - the beer pours a heady full-inch foam that disappears with settling down to a quarter-inch of frothy goodness; lacing all over this mug; consistent bubbling
S - my second beer in a week where when opened, I caught wind of the aromas from 2 feet away; honestly, I think the smell is where this beer really shines...it's pungent with grapefruit and sugars; powerful resinous hop overtones; bitter and beautiful
T - just like the nose, only pine and bready malts; grapefruit up-front; citrus; oranges; dank-ass resin hops; tasty as sin
M - light-to-medium bodied (heavy light? light medium?) with a sticky mouthfeel from the resin hop notes on the nose and tongue; balanced carbonation; has some of that hop bite
O - this is a damn fine DIPA that masks that 9% amazingly well; what more could you ask for in a pint of beer? The nose is sublime, the looks are fantastic and tantalizing, and the beer drinks with sugary-grapefruit smoothness and pine-hop oil...honestly, top shelf beer instantly. 1,100 charactersSkeeterBoganski, Jan 16, 2013

Fairly clear deep gold pour with 2 fingers of ever-so-off-white head. Decent retention and thick lace sheets.
Nose is strong grapefruit with decent bread malt underneath. Not overpowering. Very pleasant, though, without getting too aggressive.
Nice mix of citrus, floral, and hop esters. Grapefruit leads off, but strong floral in the finish giving the beer a sweeter after effect. Really feel the hops on your breath. Fairly large amount of hop oil here, without getting the beer to syrupy. Barely notice the malt body underneath all those hops, but it also does not get in the way. 
Lighter body than I expected, but works very well. 
Delicious. Easily a top DIPA and one I would fight to get again. 722 charactersbeer2day, Jan 16, 2013

Smells of sweet bready malts, tropical citrus flesh comes screaming out of the glass...this looks good
The slightly sweet body really holds this one together. Very oniony some grape like notes citrus flesh turns into rind and leaves a stinging bitterness all over. This one is surly abrasive on the palate for sure
Sticky oily resinous feel that almost coats the palate and makes it scream for more. Candy like ting on the end that kills those lupulin monsters and gets you ready for another sip.
Overall a SOLID DIPA. Very full and bold makes me want more and more and its unusual for me to love a DIPA like this. Very great offering and cant wait to try the rest of there lineup. I do prefer heady topper (have on hand also) but i would say that this comes in a VERY close secound. HT just throws everything on the plate where i feel abrasive is missing that little something at the front and backend to make it #1.
One i wish i could get year round, props to nordeastbrewer77 and goldenshowergladiator for the trades! 1,072 charactersJohnnyhitch, Jan 10, 2013

A: Pours a perfectly clear apricot color with a light yellowish head forming on the pour.
S: Sugar covered grapefruit with some dank, resinous undertones. Piney bitterness with some pineapple notes as well. Some sweet cracker malts 
T: Sweet citrus and tropical fruit notes. Pineapple and grapefruit with a little orange jam. Some peach notes creep up as it warms. The dank hops peak through with some resinous bitterness. The malt backbone is slightly sweet with notes of saltine and white bread.
M: Medium to light bodied with a semi sticky mouthfeel, but it drinks very easy. Medium-high carbonation level with a fruity and resinous finish.
O: Another winner from Surly. So many hop complexities with the tropical fruit notes, citrus and resin. The malt is slightly sweet, but mostly in the periphery. 920 charactersTreebs, Jan 10, 2013

4.57/5  rDev +2.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Surly Abrasive
Appearance: Surly’s IIPA pours a nearly crystal clear, golden color with a massive, four fingers of soft, pillowy, bone white head. Carbonation streams furiously off the bottom of the glass, giving the head excellent retention. The lacing is as impressive as the staying power. This is one of the better looking imperial IPAs on the market, though it is surprisingly a bit light, not being much darker than Furious.
Aroma: Thick hop aromas in the form of vegetal, dank, marijuana-like earthiness. This mixes wonderfully with tropical fruits, primarily mango, pineapple, oranges, and a ton of grapefruit. This is a hop-stravaganza, but there are definite, sugary sweet, light caramel malts that back up these stars of the show. The aroma is incredibly strong from the pop-fizz of the can to the emptying of the glass.
Taste: The taste is also extremely grapefruit heavy, along with accompaniments of lemon rind, and wave after wave of tropical fruits and hops in general. None of the earthiness from the aroma is present in the initial taste, unfortunately, but hop oils, pine, and resin come through instead. The tail end of the taste has the malty sweetness, but it is extremely subdued and largely hidden behind the all-out hop assault. The aftertaste is, not surprisingly, ludicrously bitter, approaching Ruination levels; here is where the earthiness comes in ever so slightly. Abrasive certainly lives up to its name.
Mouthfeel: Fantastic carbonation gives way to smoothness and creaminess, and the mouthfeel is pleasantly medium. There is, of course, plentiful astringency, and the finish is very dry as a result. It complements the taste wonderfully, and that is all that can be asked from this category.
Overall: Without question one of the best IIPAs on the market, especially in the West-coast vein. It is bitter as Hell, but the name should more than tell the prospective drinker that. Hopheads will be in love. The biggest problems with this beer are the ridiculous $18 pricetag (plus MN’s sales tax, putting the whole pack at $21 total), and the fact that one has to go to MN to get it. Those cannot be held against a beer in a taste review, but are things worth keeping in mind if anyone is in search of this bitter experience. 18/20 2,271 charactersTHANAT0PSIS, Jan 08, 2013

A: Pours a slightly hazy golden-amber. Huge frothy and effervescent off-white head. Fades quite slowly, leaving a nice neat little island of foam behind. Spiderweb lacework. 
S: Oh yeah, wonderful hop aroma. Grapefruit/citrus and tropical fruits (pineapple especially) dominate. A little pine and a bit of floral character. Get a touch of garlic/onions in there too. Surprisingly hefty caramel malt backs it all up.
T: Grapefruit is here but the garlic/onion aspect is much stronger than in the aroma. Just a touch of tropical fruit. Has some decent caramel malt in the middle but not much behind all the hops. There is some pine mixing in with the garlic/onion in the finish. Long drying, oily garlicky lingering aftertaste. 
M: Medium bodied, smooth, drying on the back end. 
O: Certainly one of the better DIPAs out there. Great complexity of hop flavors and aromas. Little malt but oddly enough not a huge bitter bomb, the hop flavors really shine all on their own. Delicious. 1,015 charactersDope, Dec 29, 2012

A - canned 11/30, so this bad boy is fresh. Into a tulip. Nice thick white head that settles slowly and laces beautifully. The color is dark reddish orange. Light copper, or sunset, or bronze, or whatever the hell you want. It's awesome. A little hazy.
S - heaven. Floral, citrus hops. No booze. Let it sit awhile and fill up your living room or kitchen. It's insanely good. My only gripe is a little funk at the very back end.
T - wow, definitely different than last time I had this. Tastes like I just chewed on some hops. The citrus smacks your palate in the...face? There's a little bitter tail. But I'm getting a little mustiness with this one too. It's not unpleasant at all - just not the clean citrus slam that I wanted. It only gets better with a lukewarm temp too. 
M - it's a little thick and oily, and the bitter burn sticks around, but it's nice. Carbonation is nice.
O - well I can't give it a 5 overall since 2 categories were 4.5, but seriously, this is one of my absolute favorites. The look and smell alone propel it towards the top, and the beer does not disappoint. Fantastic. 1,232 charactershoody711, Dec 29, 2012

4.82/5  rDev +8.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I pretty much stopped reviewing new beers, but i thought this one was special. Appearance is a guess, I drink this one like I drink HT out of the can. The nose is a grapefruit smashed into the can, really a wonderful smell, and if i get this up front I generally l know I'll love the beer. The taste really follows the nose, lots of citrus, and a ton on hops right up front. Not quite as balanced as HT, and a little more bitter, this one is very close in taste profile, but I think Abrasive has more citrus hits. This is a great brew from start to finish, and it's a little sad when you hit your last sip out of your last can. If this was available all the time it would always be in my fridge as would HT, sitting side by side where they would belong. 15 bucks a 4 pk isn't exactly cheap either, but as always france 44 gives you fresh stuff. 844 charactersnc41, Dec 27, 2012

A - out of the can, it pours an amazingly bright yellow. When it hits the glass, it goes the expected orange, but still retains some of that faintness of color. I love strong beers that look weak and vice-versa. Lingering foam, no head on the harsh pour. Deliciously yellow at the bottom, ombre, fades to the darker oranges at the top. A supreme looking beer.
S - wow, I'm hit in the face with the citrus hops, but it's not bitter at all. Just the sweeter notes, like the pineapple and oranges. I know this is in a pint glass, but that should say something about the smell: it can permeate even beyond the gaping openings of a fluted glass. 
T - delicious. Per my other reviews, I love beers that have a distinct beginning, middle, and end. Abrasive strikes first with the sweeter hops, turns floral, and finishes with the bitter notes. The taste provides what the smell doesn't, the pine, lemon, lime, and grapefruit. 
M - like most DIPAs, Abrasive succumbs to its carbonation. The 9% is clandestine, but the bubbles bring this score down.
O - my favorite DIPA to date. Even if its score is tied with my PtE review, I like this one for its affordability/availability, tremendous taste, and my ability to get it fresher that many west coast DIPAs. 1,303 charactersJamesShoemaker, Dec 25, 2012

Pours a slightly orange/gold color, slight haze, and a small, but sturdy white head.
Aromas are of a bunch of citrus. Some orange, lemon, also grapefruit. Also notes of hard candies and resin. Nice complex nose.
Taste is tart, bitter, assertive, and yup, a bit abrasive up front. In a good way for fans of hops. Background is slightly sweet, with some sugary mango, also lightly creamy, with some faint crackery malt flavors. Finish has another blast of bitterness, citrus, lime, grapefruit, and resin. Complex and tasty.
Mouthfeel is full and smooth with crisp zesty carbonation.
Overall, another outstanding beer from Surly. These guys are easily in the top 10 breweries in the USA. This beer pushes the edge, and isn't overly "drinkable", but I'm a big fan. Wish I had a few more of these sitting in the fridge... 867 charactersflexabull, Dec 21, 2012

 1: Stone's "Ruination" - 4 pack bottles 11.99
 2: Odell's "Mycenary" 4 pack bottles 10.99
 3: Weyerbacher "Double Symcoe" 4 pack bottles 11.99
 and a 4th just to hit it home, the best double ipa - bang 4 ur buck wise
4: Central Waters' Illumination 4 pack bottles for 11.99!!! GREAT DEAL & GREAT FLAVOR!!!
5: Dark Horse's Double Crooked Tree, very spendy but very worth it (15.99 4 pack bottles)
ALSO, HAS ANYONE ELSE WHOSE RATED THIS TRIED ANY OTHER DOUBLE IPAS!?!?!?!
anyways this is what i got on "Abra$ive" beside the pri$e point
appreance: Clear golden copperish color, thin white head
aroma: very hoppy, but a mix between citrus hoppy and earthy hoppy, earthyness takes the forefront
taste: high/low carbonation, very hoppy but unfortunatly almost to a harsh degree.... not that balanced when compared to other double ipas, not bad by any means but when factoring the price, very, VERY dissapointing. Unless of course your only concern is supporting your local brewery... someone let ne know please if there is a local twin cities double ipa available in the stores (i dont go out to drink, too expensive) besides Lucid's "camo" (HATED) and Surly's "abrasive"...
Surly's good but overrated and EXTREAMLY OVERPRICED! hopefully this review doesnt get revoked for being too negative, but i dont think surly has bought off B.A. yet... like it seems they possibly have with the "Growler" magazine (look at the Dec/Jan issue) 1,955 charactersBeerlover, Dec 18, 2012

S - big nose, huge citrus aroma. juniper and pine. grapefruit, orange peel. wish i could retain this aroma.Huge aroma. 
T - pine is the dominant taste, slight citrus, the orange peel and maybe a touch of grapefruit. this is a hop heads best friend. the alcohol is overwhelmed by the hops. hard to believe this one is 9%. very tasty.
M - carbonation is moderate, little less than I expected based on the Head. Smooth and really drinkable, I think this one can really sneak up on you. Nice dry finish with less aftertaste than i'm used too in the style. 
O - Wow, one of the best IIPA I have ever had, definitely top 5. There is no doubt in my mind this is the best beer in a can I have ever had. So glad I have 3 more to drink. I also like the size, 16 oz..sometimes a 12 is not enough but a bomber too much. May update when I do a side by side with some fresh Pliny and Dreadnaught next weekend!

S: The first part of the nose is all hops. TONS of citrus - pineapple, mango, and orange seem to be pretty spot on.
T: Hop, hop, hoppy. There is a great bitterness that balances out the sweet, fruitiness. As soon as you think the sweetness might be a little too much, the bitterness dries it out. I think the citrus fruit tones really add an awesome element to it. Not much malt character, which is the way I prefer an IPA, personally. There is almost no boozy taste at all. This could be extremely dangerous.
M: As mentioned previously, there is a definite dry feel as the bitterness overcompensates the sweetness a little bit. It's not overly bitter like you often get in IPAs though, and isn't too sweet. A tad under-carbonated, but really nothing else to complain about.
O: My first thought is that I am furious (see what I did there?) that I didn't buy more than one 4-pack while in Minny on a work trip. It would be really, REALLY, hard to beat this, but I just can't stomach giving something all 5's across the board. Would take this over many rated higher, and yes, that includes Pliny.

Thanks to haveanother1 for sending a 4 pack over in a trade.
A: Pours a hazy amber orange with 1 fingers width of slightly off white colored head. Fine sedimentation particles can be seen suspended throughout. Leaves patches of spotty lacing. 
S: Huge aroma. First I get tropical fruit sweetness, followed by a massive dank, resinous juniper/piney character. A bit of citrus in the form of lemon zest and orange rind. Wonderful aroma. 
T: Piney bitterness comes out first and takes center stage. I also get a big citrus component with lemon zest and grapefruit, plus a boozy alcohol presence that gets more prominent throughout the drink . I dont really get any of the tropical fruit notes, or really any sweetness at all. Its pretty much a one dimensional bitter hop bomb, but its very tasty. 
M/D: Pretty big carbonation for the style, but still smooth and very drinkable. Medium bodied, with a quick drying finish that leaves you waiting for the next sip. ABV is pretty noticeable, its not hot, but the boozy flavors are pretty prominent. 
O: Overall, certainly a good beer, but a little overhypered IMO. Enjoyable for sure, with a wonderful aroma, but the taste falls a little short for me and its boozier tasting than what I look for in a DIPA, which detracts from the hop profile. Don't get me wrong, if this were available to me on the shelves where I live, I would buy a 4 pk on every release, but with such high expectations it just came up a little short.

5/5  rDev +12.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Appearance: Very hazy pale orange color. Nice rocky white head. Leaves great lacing. This looks like a pale malt hop monster.
Smell: !!! Citrus and tropical fruit. Some melon notes. I can smell this beer from a foot away. Tiny hints of pale malt.
Taste: Opens with some balancing sweet pale malt. Then transitions into everything good about the Citra hop. Tropical fruit, citrus peel, flesh, and zest and some cantaloupe/melon type notes. Citrus to the max. This tastes like a bigger, slightly less malty Zombie Dust. Not getting any of the vegetal hop flavors I sometimes pick up from Warrior. Bitterness is not over the top for all the big qualities of this beer. Finishes dry and slightly bitter with a lingering citrus juice quality. So easy to take another sip. 
Mouthfeel: Well-carbed and only medium bodied for a a beer of this size. Finish is again lingering, dry, mildly bitter, and packed with citrus. Supremely drinkable for what it is.
Overall: This is probably the 50th can I've had of this stuff, and I can find no faults. With all respect to Hill Farmstead, The Alchemist, Lawson's, Russian River, Kern River, Alpine, DC Brau, Pipeworks, 3 Floyds, etc etc etc etc. This is the best DIPA on the planet, to my palate. 1,234 charactersjacewg, Dec 08, 2012

4.67/5  rDev +4.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.516 oz can, canned-on 11/30/12, poured into a tulip glass.
A- Pours a clear golden orange color, produces an inch thick off-white head, good retention and spotty lacing.
S- Smells amazing, loads of tropical fruit (mango, pineapple) along with grapefruit, tangerine and pine. Very juicy and vibrant. 
T- The aroma is a huge tropical fruit explosion, yet somehow even more so in the flavor. This is probably one of the fruitiest IPA's I've ever had, grapefruit, pineapple, tangerine, peach, mango, just a whole assload of really delicious fruit flavors. Pine and resin bitterness are definitely there, but are kept in nice moderation and avoid becoming overbearing. A tiny bit of caramel malt is in the background, but this beer is all about the hops. 
M- Medium-bodied, smooth feel with a slightly dry finish, alcohol is totally invisible.
O- This has instantly become one of my favorite DIPAs, the juicy, fruity hop flavors are straight up delicious and it's pretty easy to knock back even at 9%. This is easily one of the best DIPAs that is being made today. 1,063 charactersWillCarrera, Dec 08, 2012

A: golden honey colored with a thick land heavy white slightly tan head. Totally translucent looks like hops 
S: very floral hoppy smell with with lots of tropical fruit very pungent and pretty spot on for my kinda an ipa 
T: very hop forward just the way I like it almost sweet tropical fruit taste up front that is juicy there is some hop bitterness but its fairly mild though its there to dry out the finish. I like it this way but it could be more well balanced. 
M: the first thought that comes to mind is smooth and oily has almost a juice like consistency to it but the hops do have some bit. Thick but fairly drinkable and the alcohol is no where to be found so you gotta watch that.
O:I am shocked that I am saying this (especially as an imported vermonter)but this is the first beer that legitmently compares with my favorite dipa ever Heady Topper its not as good but its the first one that I have found that is comparable in taste and smell. It is very hop forward with very little bitterness thick smooth mouthfeel decent drinkability and a good smell/slash appearance. Nothing bad to say I would buy it all the time if it were available. Also my first surly beer and I will be back. 1,226 charactersPinknuggets, Dec 08, 2012

Copper golden colour to it. Was clear to start with and then hazes over a bit. Nice white foam on top. Plenty of lacing drops as it falls.
Smells of pineapple and it stays with it for an age. Pine comes through later to work with it well along with grapefruit. Really nice candied smell about it. So fresh.
Tastes of pineapple and pine, with the grapefruit on the back end. Very well put together. Flavoursome, not over the top, fresh and balanced.
Couldn't pick this as 9%. So well balanced and easy to drink. Some sweetness. But the bitterness to compliment it. 
I've liked or loved everything canned from Surly and this is no different. Super drinkable, flavoursome and most of all balanced. Having this in Australia within 3 weeks of canning is a real treat. Thanks Max! 877 charactersMrKennedy, Dec 07, 2012

4.57/5  rDev +2.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Huge thanks to MrKennedy for the Minnesota coup which snaffled this long time want of mine. Canned 20 November.
Deep sunset orange, bright and clear initially, but with a minor haze on subsequent pours. Two-finger, just off-white head of some heft which leaves an impressive raised curtain as it falls over a couple of minutes.
Lovely crisp, candied tropical and citrus aromas of pineapple, tangerine, lemon gelato, and pink grapefruit. The malt backbone is obviously responsible for the excellent clarity and sweetness, but has been so seamlessly interwoven with the hops you can barely tell it's there. 
The aromas carry through to the taste, and amalgamate with a beefy earthy pine resin presence and rich and dank jungly notes. Juicy and delectable.
Syrupy and chewy, although by no means heavy, with moderate but assertive carbonation spreading a lengthy and even bitterness throughout the palate. 
Truly unblemished with a genuinely deliciously hop profile. As someone who has fallen out of love with pointlessly big or bitter IIPAs, it's reassuring to know that when done intelligently they can be balanced and approachable, without sliding into gratuity. 1,167 charactersspicelab, Dec 06, 2012

Smell is mild grapefruit. Taste is a load of citrus, grapefruit, tangerine, orange and some slight lemon zest. What really balances this is a mild sweetnes (honey maybe) that really ties everything together. The finish is very clean and you can't wait for the next sip. The alchol is very well hiden and there is a nice effervesence to the mouth feel. Fantastic beer! 464 charactersjimmy82063, Dec 02, 2012
4.47/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a crystal clear pure golden color with an antique white head. The head is quite stubborn, contributing to the aesthetics of the beer. It has primarily a grapefruit nose with some pine breaking through. The bouquet is vibrant and it doesn't fade as the head dissipates. It has a big, thick, full mouthfeel with the perfect amount of carbonation to accentuate the entire experience. The usual pine and grapefruit flavors, but with an extraordinary balance. I've begun to notice that with these IPAs, the key component is balance. Nose, mouthfeel, flavor, finish--this one has it. It all works well together like a well-oiled machine. 637 charactersDocJitsu, Dec 02, 2012

4.86/5  rDev +9%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 510 day old can poured into a large snifter.
A - out of the can, it pours a bright yellow. When it hits the glass, it goes the expected orange, but still retains some of that faintness of color. I love strong beers that look weak and vice-versa. Lingering foam, no head on the harsh pour. Deliciously yellow at the bottom and fades to the darker oranges at the top. 
S - I'm hit in the face with the citrus hops, but it's not bitter at all. Just the sweeter notes, like the pineapple and oranges. 
T - delicious. Per my other reviews, I love beers that have a distinct beginning, middle, and end. Abrasive strikes first with the sweeter hops, turns floral, and finishes with the bitter notes. The taste provides what the smell doesn't, the pine, lemon, lime, and grapefruit. 
M - like most DIPAs, Abrasive succumbs to its carbonation. 
O - my favorite DIPA to date. 869 charactersjoshcarls, Dec 01, 2012

4.7/5  rDev +5.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Appearance: Translucent golden/straw hue with a soapy two finger off-white head. Good lacing.
Aroma: Smells like a Surly, by that I mean the usual Surlyness of the malt bill. Grain, rye, crystal malts. Pineapple/piny/mango hop presence.
Taste: A very bitter IPA. The hop character is very piny with mango with just a hint of pineapple like in the nose. Similar to Furious, it's a malt bomb but missing the amber malts giving this beer more of a west coast feel. The brewery's website lists the IBUs as around 120 but it doesn't taste quite that intense. Almost juicy. Don't taste the 9% ABV but it's robust enough that it's not a stretch to realize how potent it is.
Mouthfeel: Medium to full bodied and a little cloying in its dryness. Good drinkability.
Final Thoughts: I was expecting to be blown away by this one and it basically met my expectations. Would I drink it again? Yes, I'm going to dish out the nearly $18 for another four-pack at least one more time this year. 980 charactersJamesMN, Nov 30, 2012

Boy do I love this stuff! From the moment you open the can it's pretty much all grapefruit. Deep grapefruit aroma. Crazy intense sweet grapefruit taste with a decent amount of bitterness. The alcohol presence is barely perceptible. 
Overall, I think Abrasive is truly one the best IIPAs on the planet. Somewhat expensive at $17/4pack yes, but completely worth it to experience this one. 483 charactersd5001986, Nov 28, 2012

Pours a deep gold with lush orange-tinged amber hues topped with a two finger bright white head. Good retention and quite a bit of splotchy lacing. Pineapple, mango, and a touch of spruce on the nose. Pineapple, mango, and papaya intially, joined by a bit of sweet malt, and balanced with grapefruit rind and piney bitterness. Finishes clean and dry. Fairly fully bodied, moderate carbonation, slick and smooth on the palate. Abrasive is one of my personal favorite DIPA's. Not overly sweet, complex, abundant flavor, just the right amount of hop bitterness, and a pleasantly dry finish. Truly world-class. 772 characterschanokokoro, Nov 25, 2012
4.77/5  rDev +7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I just finished enjoying a 2012 Abrasive from a can that was brewed nine days ago. I poured the contents into a pint glass straight out of the fridge at around forty degrees. The beer was pale orange in appearance with average carbonation and a slight slight haze, but still transparent with a single finger of head. Straight off the pour I could smell the hop aroma before I even put the glass up to my nose, very citrus forward with a malt presence. The first sip was straight grapefruit followed by the entire spectrum of citrus flavors, strong malt presence quickly balanced out the strong hop rush that blew my socks off. The sides of my tongue were left with a lingering bitterness, not unpleasant just enough to let you know the hops were still there. The alcohol was hidden deep in this beer and even after it warmed up I could not taste any heat through the hops. The mouth feel was just what I look for in an IPA, it has some body but not too much so that it was not refreshing. Even though this beer comes in at 9% ABV I had no second thoughts about going to the fridge and pouring a second after I slugged down the first. Overall Abrasive is an amazing beer and definitely lives up to the hype, I can't believe I only bought one four pack. I tend to be promiscuous with my beers, but if I ever had to settle down I probably could with this beer. 1,357 charactersHANGOVER, Nov 24, 2012

Pours an orange-bronze color. Poured into a glass, it looks like orange marmalade. Fair amount of head that stays a while. Head recedes to reveal some delicate lacing.
Smell is earthy, resiny, fruity followed by tropical. Caramel mango and tangerine come across as well. 
Taste is a wonderfully sweet and bitter beer. Very drinkable considering the abv. Hop resin comes over the palate backed with a caramel sweetness. Finishes with a tangerine and grapefruit bitterness.
Really quite a full mouthfeel. It doesn't cross the line though. You know you are drinking a substantial beer.
Holds its own against any of the highly acclaimed DIPAs. 797 charactersPowderhornphil, Nov 17, 2012
4.94/5  rDev +10.8%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Canned on 11/14 and consumed 2 days later, poured into a Snifter.
Appearance: Caramel/Orange in color, with a nice two finger head that recedes pretty quickly and leaves very light lacing marks.
Smell: Heavy dose of citrus, mango, and oranges. Maybe a hint of pineapple and other passion fruits. Incredible
Taste: Another DIPA that is very heavy on the citrus, i also taste of bit of pine in there as well as a very mild malt sweetness. Leaves a dry and very bitter aftertaste.
Mouthfeel: Pretty good carbonation, A light to medium light body, fairly drinkable for a DIPA. 
Overall: This beer crushes. The best part about it is the smell. So much going on with the citrusy fruit that leaves you wanting more after every sip. Definitely try to seek this one out, it is one of the best around. 796 charactersmnphish, Nov 16, 2012

A: Pours a dark orange-amber with nice 2 inch bubbly light tan head. Decent retention and lacing.
S: Lovely and strong hop aroma of grapefruit, sweet citrus, and a hint of pine. Aroma is a consistent highlight of Surly beers.
T: Wow...everything hits a once, but in good balance. Sharp and moderately bitter hops (citrus, pine, grapefruit), caramel malt, and moderately boozy alcohol.
M: Smooth and oily up front, giving way to sharp and bitter. In the middle exists a quick burst of caramel sweetness. And in the finish, a dry and acidic note.
D: Simply superb. A tremendous brew from a tremendous brewery. 642 charactersmwilbur, May 21, 2012

S: Truly exploding with hops. Lots of grapefruit, citrus, all very juicy. 
T: Starts off following the nose with bright grapefruit and citrus then rolls over to a nice buttery scone with orange marmalade. As the baked good eases off a wave of bitterness appears in the back and grows until is smacks hard followed by some ether alcohol leaving almost a puckering effect.
M: Solid, heavy side of medium with a prickly approach but a velvety and smooth caramel type feel.
O: Phenomenal. Citrusy, bitter, potent, interesting, flavorful. I would drink this all the time if I could. Going on my tops list. You wont be sorry you tried this beer. Challenging my favorite DIPA's for top spot. 809 characterslegalpete19340, May 13, 2012

s- Yesssurrr! So piney and resiny it almost has that musty cat pee (in an awesome way) smell. Bright grapefruit and sweet citrus. Outstanding
T-Nice sweet citrus and pine. The malt backbone really holds the bitterness in such a nice balance. Bitter sweet, well integrated, very polished. Excellent

M: On the heavier side of medium with appropriate carbonation and an aggressive, but balanced, bitterness. 
O: This is one of those beers I've had a half dozen times, but apparently have never reviewed. It really is just a great beer and is probably one of the best representations of the style.

S: Loads of pineapple, some mango, orange peel, tangerine, hints of grapefruit. Hoppy as hell. I get almost no malts. Lovely.
T: A touch of caramel and toffee. A touch of pineapple sweetness then a citrus bomb on your tongue. A lot more grapefruit comes out in the taste but you still get all the others with the orange peel bitterness assaulting your palate for ever. Good luck tasting anything after this. Wow!
M: Medium body. Medium carbonation. Dry as all hell.

S: Pine, Grapefruit - smell isn't as strong as I would have liked, but it's all there. 
T: Hops then followed by sweetness, and finishes somewhat medium-level bitterness (well balanced). In addition to pine and graphfruit, I think I am getting some orange peel taste. A bit on the sweeter side than bitter. 
M: Low-to-Moderate level of carbonation, but definitely more carbonated than some DIPAs. Medium-to-high smoothness. 
O: I really really enjoyed this beer. I tend to not enjoy beers that are just a hop bomb so this was great. I think though, Hop Slam was slightly better than this (although it was probably less balanced than this). 842 characterssukwonee, Apr 08, 2012

poured into tulip from tall boy can.
Appearance: Pale yellow and orangish bodied beer with 3 fingers white head from a moderate pour. thick lacing on the side of the glass. head drops down to a thin cap that has small random small chunks of foam.
Smell: A pine and grapefuit hop bomb. Also a little bit grassy, floral, and citrisy(oranges). I get a little bit of carmel and biscuit from the malts, but hops dominate the nose.
Taste: Hop forward beer with moderate to high bitterness. I am tasting big pine and grapefruit notes, jst like the nose. Also some tropical fruit predominately pineapple and mangos. Finishes with the malt profile as I get some sweetness in the finish in the form of caramel and a mild lingering bitterness from the hops that is also resinous. 
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied beer with moderate carbonation. The beer is oily from the hops. It has a little bit of creaminess and is quite drinkable for 9%.
Overall: A really nice beer from Surly. I have been enjoying a lot of there beers lately. I wish I lived in Minnesota, Eh!? 1,093 characters4DAloveofSTOUT, Apr 03, 2012

Poured a medium golden amber that was non-traslucent but appeared to be totally filtered. Produced a froathy eggshell white head that was tightly laced and remained with some longevity. The smells are of piney, dark malts with not much on the citrus side and a definite appearance of malts. The tastes mirror those smells. The dry bitterness is adequate and has that hop resin taste. The warmer the beer gets, the more the resin smell and taste become prevalent. As a hop head, I feel the resin may be a bit much. The 9% abv is only midly obvious in the tastes. An enjoyable beer but not my favorite of the genre.

Served in a tulip glass
A - It pours deep amber, almost burnt orange, in color. I got a giant off white head.
S - I was pleasantly surprised by the tropical fruit. It dominates the aroma. I get some hints of citrus.
T - The first thing I tasted was mango. It gives way to some citrus flavors and even a little malt. The finish has just enough pine to complete the experience. 
M - It is medium. It is definitely not thin.
O - This is the second highly rated beer in two days that has lived up to the hype. I love the tropical aroma and flavors. Thank you Auslander for providing the opportunity to try this beer. 626 charactersbuschbeer, Apr 01, 2012

Pours a fairly dark copper to light amber color with a nice off white bubbly head that leaves some lacing and fades to a solid ring with a film over the beer. The nose is made up of mostly pine and some herbal floral notes with a touch of citrus. The taste blends the different hop characters extremely well mixing the pine and citrus with a noticeable malt backing. Medium bodied with good carbonation and a lingering bitterness.

A-Pours a shit ton of an orangish/pink tinted sticky white head with amazing retention and lacing. Clarity is hazy. Light brown/orange color. A very interesting looking beer.
S-Tons of fresh floral hops, a bit of sweetness in there too.
T-What an intresting beer. Hop forward of course (citrus first ending with plenty of resiny bitterness) but there is plenty of a very sweet malt taste in the middle which makes this one somewhat palatable.
M-Medium bodied with hops carried by plenty of carbonation. A bit of a oily/resiny finish.
D-If you can drink more than a pint of this you're a better man than me-it really starts to wear you down after half a pint! This one is going to stick to the palette for a awhile.
O-If you like DIPAs you must give this one a try. Truly unique and named appropriately. Too bitter and hop resin/oily for my taste but cool to give a try. 920 charactersdeebo, Mar 24, 2012

A: Pours slightly hazy orange with two fingers of dense white head. Retention is great.
S: Loads of hops - equal parts tropical fruits and floral hops. I also get a moderate amount of caramel sweetness and light bready malts.
T: Very, very bitter taste mixed with floral hops. Kind of like eating a bunch of flowers if that makes sense. I get very little sweetness in this beer but light bready malts. Mostly, this is a dry, bitter beer. Certainly for hop lovers. I love hops, but this is a bit too bitter.
M: Moderate thickness with good carbonation. Probably the best part about this beer.

T: OK, Faceslam Complete! This bastard clocks in over 120 IBU's and I like IT!! Definitely sappy sweet oil resin goodness that is not as sweet as most over 120 IBU's beers. Reminds me of a younger Devil Dancer in taste profile. Big big pucker up smash hops. It feels like your taking down straight candied pine cone resin.
M: Creamy face cramming sour pucker shot. Hockey crash board carbonation that lingers well on the palate.
O: Damn if this isn't a top 5 DIPA. (Number 2 all time) It lingers behind Founders Devil Dancer but it polevaults Double Jack in flavor profile even though D.J is more easy to enjoy. For Serious Serious HOP HEADS ONLY!! 866 characterschallenja, Mar 21, 2012

Pours cloudy golden orange with plenty of rising bubbles and a pillowy yellowish head with good lacing. Smell is Pine-Sol - dank, wet, hoppy Pine-Sol. Strong smelling and delicious. Taste is crisp sweet malts that quickly give away to a cascade(literally) of bitter hops, grass, floral, citrus all represented and in bunches. 
The name abrasive is apt, this is a palate-crusher. The only drawback is the high price. 444 charactersjimmah120, Mar 21, 2012

This one glugs out a deep orange color with a finger of persistent head. The aroma is full of juicy citrus hops, with noticeable (yet not distracting) caramel malts in the back. The taste is, yet, another knockout for Surly in the IPA department. The taste is very heavy on the pine and citrus hops, with light caramel malts in the background. The finish is fantastic, with a perfect amount of hop bitterness (read: a lot) lingering on the tongue long after taking a sip. A hophead's delight. The mouthfeel is fantastic, it's mouth-coating and "weighty", yet goes down very easily. The dirnkability is very good. Overall, it's yet another superlative IPA from Surly. As soon as I get a better job, Merwin Liquors has to watch out, as I'll be getting all Surly on their online store. 851 charactersshand, Mar 21, 2012

Pours a really nice caramel color with a hint of peach hues. 1 inch head that fizzled away.
Smells a bit nutty with some citrus and pine. Doesn't smell like it is going to be very bitter. A little funky.
Each sip hits the tongue with a sharp bite but then quickly smooths out with some sweetness. Definitely not as hoppy as a west coast IPA. I enjoy these more balanced hoppy/malty beers and think they have a high drinkability.
Leaves my palate candy-coated and I can't wait to get the chance to try this again. 589 characterscocoapuph, Mar 19, 2012

Is this on nitro? What a microscopic bubbled looking caramel yellow like head, giving that wonderful lacing nitro looking coating while drinking. Body is a noticeable red amber, hints of orange and very clear. 
Nose on tap seems a little more subdued, but is giving to richness. Hop forward with some faint novocaine/phenol and band aid, but goes to citrus faint orange, and mostly pineapple. Lingering, solid. Can't wait to try this.
Hits the palate with an unbelievable nitrous and creamy feel. I had to ask if this was on nitro cause I couldn't tell and it seemed to have all the hallmarks of one. It wasn't. Chewy orange citrus hops, bust still brings that novocaine in the finish just slightly. Super soft resin and chewy in the palate, hints at dense English marmalade bitter.
Overall, I like this better when I had it out of the can, but the palate feel on this just can't be beat. I just wish it had the pepper jalapeno like sense that I missed, but it's still impressive. 1,050 characterssmakawhat, Mar 14, 2012
4.17/5  rDev -6.5%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4On-tap at a Surly event at Churchkey in DC.
A: Orange pour without much head rising up, leaving only spotty lacing. Bubbles lazily work their way to the top of the brew, but the head retention and lacing is a bit lacking.
S: OK, maybe I'm crazy, but I smell onions here. I've heard that certain hops can give off an onion-like aroma, but I had yet to experience it. That and citrus play nicely (I don't hate the onion smell, just was surprised to say the least), and are a part of an overall floral aroma. Certainly hop forward, a nice fruit base holds it together.
T: I'm getting slight onions on the taste, too. Big citrus and completely focused on the bitter end of the hop spectrum. While the hops do "punch you in the face," the citrus and fruits create some sort of balance...but by balance I still mean damn hoppy.
MF: Abrasive has a light body with a nice amount of carbonation. The sheer bitterness of this beer does hurt its drinkability, but the hops don't coat the mouth and stick around for too long which sometimes really hurts beers like this overall.
O: This was really good, but it does nothing to make itself stand out in the land of big IPAs (unless you count onions). I would absolutely try this again, however. Don't pass it up! 1,254 charactersrusswbeck, Mar 13, 2012

A: bright orange body. bright white head. good lacing and retention.
S: boatloads of citra hops. kiwi's. lemons. limes. cantaloupe. the ABV tells me there is malt back there but i cant find any in the nose. however, i dont really mind.
T: super sticky palate. coconut, passion fruit. a little medicinal? the finish is very green, but also malty and vanilla-y. very pleasant. 
M: moderate carbonation on a med/full body.
D: pretty tasty DIPA. the malt provides enough balance in a brew that really focuses on making warrior and citra hops the main stars. 612 charactersJimmys, Mar 13, 2012

4.32/5  rDev -3.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4An apt name if there ever was one. 3 week old can. Clear orange gold with a nice cap of white foam, good retention and lots of lace. Big time hops punch you in the face from a foot away, lots of pine and floral notes. Tastes even bigger. Not much fruity citrus or sweetness here, just a brutal bitter hop flavor, plenty of onion and garlic to go along with the resinousness, pine and grass. Maybe a bit of grapefruit rind. No maltiness whatsoever. Big brash and unapologetic. Mouthfeel is excellent, big and smooth and creamy with moderate carbonation. Bitter finish lingers and lingers.
No question this is a top flight DIPA for those looking for an extreme hop experience. The flavor profile wasn’t my favorite, as the aggressive onion note was a bit much. To be honest I preferred Furious and for DIPAs Heady and Pliny. But glad to have tried this and would definitely come back…particularly if I wanted to be punched in the face, over and over, by hops.
Edit: Palates shift and so do yearly hop flavors. Man this is a tremendous DIPA. More sweet citrus and tropical flavors this time around, simply awesome. 1,117 characterstobelerone, Mar 12, 2012
4.23/5  rDev -5.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Canned 2-13-12. Pours a clear, light amber color with a large, off-white head. Scent is quite hoppy with a nice malt backbone as well. Earthy hop aromas with some caramel malt a bit of grass. Some grapefruit and melon. Taste is initially quite citrusy. A blast of orange, lemon zest, grapefruit at first. Nice grass and pine resin...pretty dank flavors here. Kinda reminds me of Maharaja. Finishes bitter with a lot of caramel malt. A bit of alcohol burn in the finish. Mouthfeel is full bodied and somewhat creamy. Crisp bitter finish. Drinkability is high. Overall, I'm really glad I got to try this. It's a great double IPA! 627 charactersDovaliHops, Mar 11, 2012

More than any other beer, Abrasive reminds me of the DIPAs I typically brew. Juicy and full of hops (Citra) with a malt character that is present, but not a hindrance. Real easy to drink if you're a hophead. Tons of grapefruit upfront with a very clean pine backbone. Not too sweet, but not bone dry either. Not too bitter for my tastes... just right. 
Superb lacing with a brilliant orange-yellow body full of hazy hop oils. Creamy mouthfeel. I wouldn't say it's "full" body, but it's definitely rich with dextrins and visible hop oils, which aids mouthfeel to the moderately high side of things. I think I prefer this to Elder. It's close. It just doesn't look as pretty. 745 charactersaficionado, Mar 08, 2012

Pours a hazed burnt gold with a healthy sized off white head and terrific lacing. Classic DIPA retention... the lacing paints the glass from start to finish.
Nose is massive. Loads of citrus, mainly grapefruit or tangerine. Supported by an ample dose of spruce/pine, incredibly dynamic for such a hop-centric brew. The malt base is reminiscent of fluffy oats and honey.
The taste reflects the aroma. Big pine resin that gets overwhelmed by big citrus, tropical juice. The malts take a backseat to a giant hoppy nectar of the gods. Addictive bitterness, creamy and full-bodied. A delight of a beer. 638 charactersyamar68, Mar 01, 2012

Tangerine wheat slightly cloudy appearance with a hint of red.

Can I smell this all day long please. 
Bright pine needle, citrus(Myer lemon, grapefruit, lime zest) green grass, hops, sugar.
Taste gives me some tangerine line custard, with a combo of lime cypress, California pine, (sour diesel) and candied lemon zest.
Mouth feel is nice, I fount a slight bitterness, or tannin from the hops. Alc. isn't a big factor here as its quite drinkable.

A - Poured into XL snifter. Body has a dark orange color, with 1 finger of off-write head. Head recedes leaving bubbles and lacing after about a minute. 
S - Huge waves of citrus hops, crisp piney hops, with a bready malt background. I can't wait to have a sip!
T - Piney hops upfront, citrus hops in the background. Bitter aftertaste. This is as 'in your face' as an ipa can get.
M - Lighter carbonation, goes down smooth. Alcohol well-hidden
O - This is a huge bruiser of a beer. It's good, but I would love to have some extremely fresh. It still gets high marks - I think this the most intense IPA I've ever had.
Edit - has this on tap at Stub and Herbs yesterday, and it is so much more amazing when fresh. Unless the cans are <1 week old, they don't do this beer justice. HUGE citrus taste that explodes in the mouth - mango, pineapple, apricots, nectarines. Incredibly drinkable and delicious. Far superior to Hopslam (I would score it almost 5). A religious experience. 1,009 charactersgregy55902, Feb 24, 2012

A - Dark amber body with a massive fluffy off-white head. Looks great.
S - Loads of tropical fruits with a piney finish. Love the mango and papaya notes. 
T - Same as the nose, mango and papaya followed by a piney bitter finish and some light caramel malts. The bitterness is lasting but not overpowering. Mouth feel is a bit light but carbonation is spot on and the high alcohol isn’t noticeable.

Pours out a deep yellow orange with a massive offwhite head that stayed forever, tons of lacing.
On the nose is massive citrus fruit, some pine and sweet fruit, but overwhelming Simcoe/Amarillo-esque hop.
The flavor follows the nose with huge fresh citrus hops and a solid amount of bitterness leaving you craving the next sip. Some light honey stickiness with a little bit of mango at the end.
 Mouthfeel is medium with huge amounts of carb.
Overall exceptional and darn close to Hopslam in top tier DIPAs. Always welcome as an extra! 587 charactersNetdigger2, Feb 22, 2012

4.25/5  rDev -4.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5This DIPA from Surly pours a nice honey color, a bit hazy, but still rather transparant. A big white billowy 3 finger head sits atop the beer, which has a mild retention but impeccable lacing. The aroma bursts out of the glass, big rich citrus notes race forth even as it fills the glass. Tons of citrus, earthy pine and a nice big malt bill anchor the aroma which also has minor notes of lemongrass, juniper and even some mint. The flavors are really superb, it’s a bit malt forward, a variety of cereal malts and lighter biscuit lead the way, but a nice wave of citrus takes charge in the middle and leads to some sappy and sweater pine flavors that finishes with sharper resinous finish. The body is nice and full, smooth and easy going that finishes dry and bitter.
Verdict: A great DIPA from Surly. The flavors are nicely balanced and with great malty elements with solid hoppy flavors and a nice dry finish, this should be on any hopheads wish list. 958 characterskevanb, Feb 21, 2012

S: This is hands down the best smelling IPA I have ever had! There is a strong mango/pine aroma up front with complex tropical and citrus notes in the background. It reminds me of smelling freshly opened hops on brew day, but better. 
T: This beer will rip the tongue right out of your mouth. Extremely bitter with no noticeable malt character. Despite the lack of perceived maltiness it is very well balanced and extremely complex. 
M: Surly wasn't kidding when they called this beer Abrasive. This beer is extremely astringent which left an almost uncomfortable dryness in my mouth. This was the only off putting aspect of the beer, although unavoidable considering the hoppiness. 
O: Hands down the best IPA. Better than Heady Topper and Dreadnaught in my opinion. Bravo Surly! 859 charactersRasolante1, Feb 21, 2012

A copper colored body sits under a cream colored cap. The head falls slowly, in raindrop fashion, and clings everywhere inside the glass.
The aroma is of pineapple, ruby red grapefruit, sweet toasted malt, spruce tips, and oranges. The malt is noticeable, but is just a foundation for all of these hops to play.
Tropical fruit notes dominate the palate with the malt laying low. Oranges, spruce, pineapple, and ruby red grapefruit coming in waves. The finish is juicy, sweet fruit with only a mild bitterness at first. As you work your way through, the bitterness builds a little with each sip.
Chewy, full mouthfeel with perfect carbonation. You either want your dipa's to be clean and smooth or big and chewy. This is definitely the latter.
I was excited to try this one after having the furious for the first time recently. I really enjoyed this one. It rivals the elite in the class. 956 charactersColForbinBC, Feb 18, 2012

The aroma is pretty good, a lot of pithy grapefruit and pine, with obvious bitterness behind it. Lots of malt evens things out, with a sugary sweetness to it.
Abrasive leads off with big, juicy citrus and a punch of grapefruit. Barely any pine comes through in the flavor, but there is a pretty good amount of bitterness. The finish has a good bit of malt to it, with a bunch of caramel sweetness and some sugary, cookie-like sweetness.
The bitterness attacks the tongue a little bit and gives an oily fan, while the carbonation is quite effervescent.
Abrasive is a solid IIPA, but I have to say I would prefer a furious any day. Still, Surly doesn't miss on beers very often, and this is certainly not a miss. 920 charactersHojaminbag, Feb 15, 2012

The grapefruit bitterness is there but leaves quickly and doesn't linger on my tongue it is followed up by a malty sweetness. There is also some fruit flavor like orange/tangerine or some other sweet fruit, last there is a good piny flavor to it as well. It has a medium/thin mouthfeel but when compared to others in the style I find it a little too thin for me, the carbonation is on point. Overall this is a good beer if this was local I would drink it, but IMO there are others in this style that are better. 806 charactersphisigben, Feb 15, 2012

4.1/5  rDev -8.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Poured from a 16oz can into a Duvel Tulip. Canned just over three weeks ago.
A: Pours a mostly clear dark copper color. Normal pour leads to a rocky two finger head that slinks its way down the sides of the glass with each passing moment leaving a trail of lacing behind. Picking up some floaties in the bottom of the glass.
S: The can mentions that it's over-hopped and I'd like to say I disagree with them because, in my very humble opinion, I don't believe it's possible for a DIPA to be over-hopped. This beer definitely has its fair share of hops though. Whoo. This is a hop-heads dream nose. Big time grapefruit and pine resin notes with beefy malt back end lurking in the shadows. ABV can be detected slightly.
T: Hop flavor backs down a touch but only in the forefront I think. It definitely maintains its presence through the taste and it might even get better at the end. Citrus (mostly in the form of grapefruit) and pine are the hop flavors. Malty back end is again subtle yet not absent.
M: The feel is a touch thin and I think if I had to knock this beer, it would probably be here. The carbonation is ample but the beer just kind of disappears without leaving a big thick DIPA creamy coating that leaves me wanting more. It's not terrible, but I can't say it's great either.
O: This is a very good DIPA. I'm glad I was able to grab a 4-pack but at the cost I got it for (purchased from france44.com) I will probably not quickly seek out another. Really solid though altogether. 1,497 characterssuspect, Feb 15, 2012

A - Pours a fairly clear yellow-amber, with a solid two fingers of off-white head. Great spidery fingers of lacing, but retention is only so-so. Nice looking beer.
S - Sweetish side of mango and passionfruit, with a touch of grapefruit lurking in there somewhere. Loads of cotton candy and crystallized ginger. Not getting a lot of the pine like others have, but for me that's a good thing. Boy, this is a fantastic smelling beer. So far I love it as much as Pliny, only for different reasons/smells. 
T - Ah, there's the pine, right up front, giving it a strong bitter backbone. Tropical fruit flavors are around the edges, but not anywhere near as sweet as in the nose. Plenty of citrus pith in the finish, which is fairly short but pretty dry. A (very) slight letdown after the fantastic aroma. 
M - Carbonation is outstanding, with very consistent, fine bubbles. Medium body, and not too aggressive, which seems to be a downfall for beers like these. The beer is fairly drying, but not too bad for a DIPA. 
O - A great beer, a just short of being my favorite of the style. We did our annual three-way blind test of this against Pliny and Hopslam, and Abrasive came out in the middle this year (just barely behind Pliny but way ahead of this year's Hopslam). Surly continues to impress. 1,416 charactersdjmichaelk, Feb 12, 2012

A - Average, but good looking. Copper-dark amber in color, touch of chill haze, one finger white head with nice lacing.
S - SO MUCH PINE AND GRAPEFRUIT! Initially I smelled just pine, but subsequent whiffs reveal a citrus hop dominance in the form of grapefruit. Caramel provides sweetness.
T - Bitter and resinous, the pine returns powerfully. The grapefruit is still ever-present, but more evenly matched by the pine now. A bit of alcohol astringency is indeed present, along with pure hop bitterness. The sharp booze is present in the finish, leaving your last impression of the beer as being boozey, when the rest of it really isn't, which is unfortunate. Sweet malts exist in the form of caramel.
M - Medium in body, some sharp carbonation. Overall it is smooth as silk, but abrasive due to carbonation bubbles tickling your tongue aggressively. Nice dry finish.
O - Overall a wonderful DIPA, and the second best such beer available in a pint can! Great blend of hop flavors with sweet malt flavors. 1,085 charactersgreenmonstah, Feb 11, 2012

3.53/5  rDev -20.9%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5Poured from a can into a glass
A - Dark amber with hints of orange, brown, and gold. Had a two finger off white head that went down to about a quarter of an inch. 
S - Smells of orange and grapefruit. There is also a slight pine that comes up as well.
T - At first, I note sweet fruit with hints of pineapple and clementines. As the beer lingers, it become more bitter as the hops kick in. The hops are pine in nature and leave a lingering bitterness on the end of the beer. The hops actually come out a bit more in the finish than you would guess at first. Overall, this is one of the more hoppy DIPAs I've had. It does well to balance against the sweet at the beginning while keeping a good hoppy bitterness on the back end. 
MF - Body is on the lower end of medium body and feels about thin for the beer. There is a very, slight stickiness to it and it has good carbonation to it as well. Leaves a slight hop resin on the tongue in the finish
O - A hoppier DIPA that leaves some hoppy bitterness, more than you would expect from the smell and the initial flavors you get. However, I was a little let down by this one as I did not think it was an elite DIPA. I'm happy to have some to try but would not go thru the work to get it. I have to say I actually like Furious much better. 1,288 charactersjeonseh, Feb 11, 2012

A: Pours a golden copper. Two fingers of crisp white head recede to a quarter finger. Very good head retention. My glass is coated with sticky lacing. Very nice looking.
S: The nose is very tropical, with pineapple, grapefruit, and mango. Underlying the sweet citrus is some very bitter pine resin and an herbal grassy quality that ever so slightly reminds me of onion. Rather than overwhelming the bouquet, however, the grassy notes complement and balance the citrus notes. Blends together quite nicely. Excellent, one of the best I've encountered. Booze is undetectable, which is impressive for this high an ABV.
T: Tropical fruit, pine resin, and some grassy hops. All of these are exceptionally well-integrated. Onion is a little more prevalent here, as is a bitter minerality. I also get hints of mint in the finish. But the tropical flavors keep it from being overwhelming and a little malt presence keeps this one rounded. Very good.
M: Medium bodied, well-balanced, moderate carbonation. A nice, lingering hop oil finish. 
O: Very few DIPAs do it better than Abrasive. This is an excellent and complex DIPA. A hop bomb, but incredibly smooth. Great beer. 1,220 characterssiege06nd, Feb 10, 2012

Poured a 1/23/2012 into a Surly "Power to the Pint" pint glass.
Gorgeous clear amber/orange color. Minimal head fell quickly but left nice sticky lacing which is still hanging on.
Aromas of huge citrus hops followed up by a bit of spicy pine hops as well. The beauty of this hop bomb of a DIPA is it also has a perfectly balanced malt profile. I pick up hints of fresh whole grain bread and cookie. Glorious!
Flavors are leafy citrus hops followed by hops and hops and hops. Its like Furious on hops steroids.
I love Abrasive season and remember my first experience when a buddy brought over two growlers of 16 grit. We put one out for the party crowd and split the other. I miss the surly growlers. 774 charactersadrock7309, Feb 10, 2012

A: A gorgeous translucent orange color with one finger of light light tan head that fades slowly and provides amazing lacing for the whole glass..
S: A delicious mix of floral and grassy hops burst through, with a hint that this beer has the malt backbone to support the massive amount of hops.
T: Simply amazing. There's a slight breadiness from the malt that is very enjoyable, as well as some citrus and grassy notes.
M: Medium mouthfeel with a dry finish, average carbonation.
O: In my opinion this is tied for the best DIPA in the country with Hopslam. Nothing else comes close (not even PtE). It's a shame that it isn't available more widely, or for more of the year, but that does nothing to bring down it's score. Any true hop lover should make it a priority to obtain some of this at your earliest convenience. You won't be disappointed. 902 charactersduffcalifornia, Feb 09, 2012

The bitterness actually made my mouth salivate in some very weird way, kinda near the front of my mouth, that's never really happened before. Kinda hard to explain. Bottom line, so much great flavor crammed into the can, just an awesome double. 435 charactersKickbacksSteve, Feb 09, 2012

A - Pours a clear deep copper with one and a half fingers of off-white head. Head has nice retention and leaves nice rings of lacing.
S - Big citrus hop aroma with some pine as well. Also some touches of tropical fruit, caramel malt and faint florals.
T - Citrus is also very big in the taste, with some grapefruit and both bitter and juicy orange. This is very well balanced. Yes, there is a strong hop presence and considerable bitterness, but there is also a bit of sweetness and some caramel malt that balance this really well. Finish is a long lasting bitterness.
M - Very smooth, medium mouthfeel that is a bit resinous. Finish is bitter with an earthy dryness.
O - The 9% is nowhere to be found in the taste. This is a very easy drinking DIPA, not at all in your face, that has a nicely balanced flavor profile. 838 characterswarnerry, Feb 07, 2012

S - Sweet citrus, resiny, loads of pine and earthy cedar, a peppery spice finish.
T - Loaded with citrus and pine, nice bitter lemon, creamy milky caramel, peppery spice lingers alongside a hint of ABV heat. The ABV is very well hidden and the heat is surprisingly complementary.
M - Medium bodied, smooth and finishes nice and dry.
O - Solid DIPA. These guys have yet to disappoint. I'm looking forward to my next trip to procure a few more of these, because it is simply delicious and would be well received by any hop head. 774 charactersandrenaline, Feb 05, 2012

A vibrant copper body with some light brown hues. An off-white, slightly orange head rests atop and leaves a good amount of sticky lacing after the initial inch subsides. 
The aroma is of wet, citrusy hops with a noticeable spice note. Grapefruit and orange comprise the citrus, but the nose really is all about the hops and their pine/nature aromatics. 
The taste is also a great showcase of the beloved little cones, with their bittering and spicy characteristics right up front. The citrus pulls through in the middle, where again it’s mostly orange and grapefruit. Another appearance of the spice and pine resin on the finish. Some fresh grass on the aftertaste, which isn’t as off-putting as it sounds. 
Mouthfeel is crisp, and almost sweet from the citrus; carbonation is spot on, but it finishes extremely dry. I find myself reaching for water just as often as another sip of the beer. 
Overall, a delicious DIPA that is certainly worthy of attention. Seek this one out! 1,101 characterseclipse54, Feb 03, 2012

Well, this one pours out hops. No liquid, just the flowers. Kidding. But not really. Upon cracking this bad boy open the hops aroma just kills. Tropical and juicy. Can't wait. It begs to be in my belly.
Pours a glowing orange, bright. Nice head. Screw this, I'm drinking it.
Aroma. See above. Persimmon, passion fruit in back, mango heavy. Pineapple core. Soft sweet caramel is doing its best to not gain too much attention, because if it does the hops will beat the shit out of it. 
Yeup. Hops. Citrus and tropical. Green grass and green pine. A touch "abrasive" (zing), but great flavors. The malt is happy where it is, and so am I. Got take away 1/2 point for not being balanced, but it's darn fine. 825 charactersMebuzzard, Feb 02, 2012

Appearance; poured a crisp, lively orange color, with one finger of straw colored head that quickly dissipated leaving a thin film... Lacing is solid, leaving spidery veins all over the glass.
Smell; I was NOT prepared for this... I popped the top and it smelled like I stepped off the airplane into Hawaii, fresh tropical aroma, pineapple, tangerine, orange and grapefruit rinds... The smell started to take over my kitchen (and I am absolutely not complaining about that!!) 
Taste; taste is much the same as the smell, pineapple, grapefruit, tangerine and orange rinds... A moderate bitter finish, with a slight lingering bite that seems to have pepper in it, but I find that it nicely compliments the lingering bitterness... Also, I may be crazy...
Mouthfeel; light medium body that feels lively on the tongue, feels velvet like on the tongue towards the finish, which comes in to compliment the bitterness beautifully.
Overall; a rock solid DIPA, I would absolutely seek this out again... I was slightly let down by Furious and I'm starting to think that my choice to drink Hopslam and then Furious was a poor one given how I feel about Abrasive... I was a little concerned about the onion bomb some have described this beer to be, but I went into it with an open mind and I feel like I was greatly rewarded. I definitely recommend Abrasive, and will absolutely seek out both Abrasive and Furious again in the future!! 1,489 charactersThingus, Feb 02, 2012

Good beer, but with so many other DIPA's out there this one just didn't seem to live up to its hype.
A: Single fingered head that displayed ok retention, settling to a thin film atop this deep orange, mostly transparent beer.
S: Tropical fruit notes, most detectable was passion fruit, bready malts, floral bitter hoppiness followed by oily pine. Smell reminded me of Alpine's Nelson.
T: More bitter than the scent lead me to think. Tropical fruit flavors and those bready malts follow the bitterness nicely. Sugary malts poke through and bring up the backend of the tasting.
M: Medium bodied, well carbonated, lingering bitter aftertaste.
O: I really enjoyed this beer, but I feel there are so many better examples of the style out there. If I lived in Minnesota and had easy access to this beer I know I would drink it again in the future, but since I don't I really can't see myself seeking this one out again. 958 characterstjkinate, Jan 31, 2012

4.65/5  rDev +4.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Reviewing the last of my Surly's that I picked up just before Christmas. This one is dated 12/14/11, meaning it is about a month 1/2 old. However, I've had two four packs over the past month, so I've been tracking how it holds up. Honestly, it is not that much worse now than it was when I had one less than a work old.
Appearance: Dark orange with only the slightest ruby hue. The head forms and sticks well throughout the session. It is sticky on the glass when swirled, gently sliding done while leaving a slug trail behind it.
Aroma: The biggest area of change as it aged over a month and 1/2. Grapefruity and sweet on the nose. Fresh, the citrus flesh aromas were intense. It is a little less fused now, but still excellent. More rindy and bitter as it ages. The malt conjures up notes of caramel and bread dough.
Tastes: Really, it is a great DIPA. The can says says it is underbrewed, which I didn't know exactly what they meant by that until I tried it. The malt is deceivingly sweet in this, but the really aggressive hops still keep this guy in the hop bomb category. Grapefruit, floral, and pine hop flavors and tempered in all the right ways by the big malt, meaning it is really not all that bitter. Just delicious. The linger develops well too with a nice ruby red juice taste.
Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Great on this account too. For as thick as it looked in the glass, it really is light on the palette and slips right down the gullet, leaving only that wonderful linger. Another review said that this didn't taste like a DIPA, but more like a single IPA. This is the only category that I may agree with that statement.
Overall: A great beer. In high DIPA season, I only wish I had regular access to this bad boy. It would be my fridge beer for the season. 1,775 characterssoze47, Jan 30, 2012

It's a good solid IPA, although i'd never think to classify it as a double. It's subtle, delicate in flavor like Sculpin from Ballast Point. That, or the can we'd tried was very old. The hops weren't very forward and it was more malty and quaint than other IPA's.
Pours fine with a decent head, nice lacing and legs. Rich ambery-red. Smells like wet hops and lemon. Tastes like a sculpin clone. Imbibeable to no end, no alcohol presence makes it dangerous.
Overall, great. 550 charactersAiptasia, Jan 29, 2012

*From notes
-- Thanks, Ben. Yet another killer extra from one of my favorite traders --
A: Unfiltered jac-o-lantern orangey-amber. An eager pour yields a thick two finger head that never really settles down.
S: This thing puts a hurtin' on my nostrils before the glass even gets there. Dump trunk beds of fruity, intense hops amp this up to 11.
T: Man does this push the limits of what you'd call a Double IPA. It's insanely bitter, yet it's the violent fruit-forward concentrate that overwhelms the palate. It's got a slight bit of that oniony quality to it, but it's faint. By the end of each sip, I can feel the hop oil oozing from my pours.
M: It feels like a million bucks. I've yet to find another Surly brew (sans Darkness) that feels this creamy, complex and rich. It's got near-perfect carbonation to it, something most of their other canned offerings tend to lack.
O: Hands down the best canned beer I've ever had from Surly. This DIPA is borderline over the top, as it puts one foot over the ledge then steps slowly back. A grand achievement, and one I recommend seeking out in large quantities. 1,164 charactersRhettroactive, Jan 29, 2012

4.07/5  rDev -8.7%look: 2 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Poured from a 16 oz. can into a tulip glass.
A: Hazy, light amber color with a residue of off-white bubbles. Moderate lacing remains on the glass and large particulates slowly settle out of the column.
S: Piney hops are clear, dominant, and resinous, with additional orange citrus qualities neatly filling the gaps. Volatile hops show impressive duration, allowing little else to intrude except perhaps a trace of yeast ester that joins seamlessly with the citrus hops, making its presence mysterious. No alcohol is detected.
T: Begins off-dry, with piney and dank herbaceous hop aromatics. Acidity is mild into the middle where bready malt and defining pithy orange juice are noted. The finish is drying with relatively mild and clean bitterness. A whiff of herbaceous plant lingers on the palate, but no alcohol is detected.
M: Medium viscosity, slightly sticky and acidic on the palate, with moderate carbonation.
D/O: This remarkable DIPA yields a smell that outdistances all other features, though honest orange flavor is not without its charms. It proves to be an uncluttered and effective canvas for inspired hop qualities. 1,135 charactersbeagle75, Jan 29, 2012

A - The beer pours a deep orange golden color with a huge 2.5 finger white head. Nice lacing and retention.
S - Blown away by the hop aroma: lots of grapefruit, orange, lemon and pine qualities. The sweet malt character is prevalent as well though is clearly dominated by the hops.
T - Just where the nose finished the beer begins. Hops! Lots of grapefruit, orange, lemon and pine up front with a large bitterness. The beer develops with the caramel malt sweetness in the middle with an almost fruity quality. The end of the beer brings the onion-taste I am not found of in the DIPAs which lingers for the remainder of the beer. Only downside.
M - Medium bodied with good carbonation.
D - Solid drinkability. The alcohol is hidden fairly well.
Overall, I am glad to have tried the beer and am grateful to Paul for the chance to try it. He tells me the onion wasn't there last year and the beer was more of a Maharaja-type beer. I wouldn't compare the two but this is a pretty solid brew.
Note: This review was a re-post from my former account, jmkratt, which was hacked and I lost all my reviews...sorry for the redundancy.

A - Caramel colored body, a little darker than I'm used to for this sort of brew. About a finger of frothy head that cuts down by about half after the first couple sips, lots of sticky lacing throughout.
S - Sweet moses, this smells amazing. Big citrusy hops hit in the front (grapefruit, lemon zest) with a sweet malt backbone. The nose reminds me of Zombie Dust...or is it the other way around?
T - The bitterness of the hops you are expecting from the nose aren't quite as prevalent in the taste. This is a well balanced brew to me, bites you up front but you get a nice sweet, toasted malt finish.
M - Definitely an oily taste in the mouth afterward, but no bitter aftertaste. Medium to heavy-bodied, not over carbonated.
O - Definitely one of the top DIPAs I've had, for being 9% I was very happy with how smooth it was. Need to get my hands on more of this! 904 characterswillseph, Jan 26, 2012

T- Front palate is super bitter, no sweetness, a little tart? Mid palate is the extreme pine that ive been smelling. Back end is the lingering bitterness. Unlike Furious, this beer is better at hiding the specialty malts in it.

O- Furious on steroids. Love this beer. Demand more. ISO: more furious FT: Fresh Pliny/Blind Pig 750 characterskmatlack, Jan 25, 2012

4.85/5  rDev +8.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured from can into pint glass. Honey colored beer, murky and slightly opaque. Great two finger head, killer lacing. The froth sticks to the glass.
Smell is hop, grassy, very similar to furious, a little bit of malty balance in the background.
From the first gulp to the last, Abrasive is a hop whoop ass. Man. Pine and grapefruit come along in the background, but it's a hop showcase first and foremost. Never gets bitter or astringent. I am not sure how you improve on this.
Ditto for the mouthfeel. Carbonation is perfect, slickness and weight of the beer is perfect. This is 9% ABV??? Really??? Well hidden. I suppose this could be improved on....if drinking it transported you to a place where you were surrounded by naked Katy Perry lookalikes.
The lack of naked Katy Perry lookalikes notwithstanding, this might be the best beer I've ever had. Painfully spendy, but I'm willing to sell my children for more. 919 characterslurpy1, Jan 24, 2012
4.3/5  rDev -3.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Canned on 1/12/12.
Pours a murky honey orange with a 1 inch foamy orange-white head that settles to a thin cap. Thick chunks of lace stick to the sides of the glass on the drink down. Smell is super hoppy: citrus zest/grapefruit, pine, and some earthy herbal aromas. Taste is of citrus zest, pine, and herbal hops, grapefruit, and a malt backbone on the finish. There is a mild bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp but slightly sticky mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good and very hoppy DIPA. However, the name is a bit misleading because I don't find anything abrasive about this beer. 648 charactersUCLABrewN84, Jan 24, 2012

This beer pours a medium bodied, smooth and creamy dark apricot orange in color with an incredibly smooth creamy off white one finger head. The nose is full of citrusy, tangerine like hops with moderate sweetness and mild bitterness. The hop profile is full of oranges, tangerines, and sweet apricots. Great, fresh and fruity appeal. The flavors are smooth, mildly bitter citrusy hops once again. The orange, tangerine, and apricot marmalade are superb. This beer drinks ultimately smooth and the alcohol isn't noticeable whatsoever. This is a really nice IPA and as always, Surly captures what an IPA can be like few others. 760 charactersaasher, Jan 24, 2012

A- See through golden honey orange color. Head very typical for this style. Pours with a 2 finger head of thick tight bubbles thats has a straw like hue. Really nice looking beer.
S- Big Huge citrusy hop aroma as soon as the can is opened. Smell fills the room, lots of sweet ripe fruits, lots of amarillo hop aroma, little pine, little hop astringency, and so small sweet bready malts. The smell of this beer is amazing.
T- Sweet malt, really nice bitterness and a Huge citrusy fruit taste. I pick up on some caramel malt and no alcohol which is surprising for a 9% beer. Very nice balance here between hops and malt. Its a great mix of bitter and sweet. Very enjoyable.
M- very smooth Dipa mouthfeel with high carbonation coming of the bottom of the glass.
O- Very good Dipa, Im glad I sought this one out. I thought Furious was good, this is better. Its Furious's bigger older brother, an Abrasive is the Alpha. This is a beer I want all year round. Its a perfect balance of tropical citrusy fruit, pine, and sweeet bready caramelly malts. The hype behind this one is warranted as was the time i spent trying to find it. Get yourself some, when and if you can. Highly Recommended. 1,230 charactersHopsHopenstein, Jan 22, 2012

4.5/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A - Pours a fairly clear burnt orange amber color with a huge 3 fingers of dense off white head. Great thick head retention and sticky lace clings to half of the glass. 
S - Aroma really grabs you right away. Huge bursts of caramel and toffee, blended with grapefruit. At first, the smell is much more hoppy, but then mellows into that traditional aroma profile of a DIPA quickly.
T - Soft and super smooth opening of herbal and woody hops. A sweet center adds a touch of counterweight before a crisp, dry, bitter pine finish.
M - Medium bodied, and bit too smooth. Could stand a bit more carbonation.
O - Glad I traded for this one. One of the best DIPA's I've ever had. 675 charactersSkiBum22, Jan 21, 2012

A - Pours a cloudy, Longhorn orange with two fingers worth of frothy, creamy eggshell head. Very nice looking beer, if not just a tad beefy for a DIPA. 
S - Beautiful aroma of citrusy hops with a little bit of funk to it. Huge grapefruit notes as well as a bit of a bready characteristic. Pretty huge malty background as well in the nose. Cuts through the hops a little too much.
T - Follows pretty closely from the nose, with a nice burst of citrus and funk in the start, powerful grapefruit notes, but then a huge malty follow-up, which evens things out a bit. Almost a bit of tartness to the grapefruit characteristic, which is quite pleasant. A clean, dry finish as well, which cleanses the palate nicely.
M - A bit of an alcohol sting to it at the beginning, but goes away as it swirls around the mouth. This is another one of those beers that has that feel to it that I can only described as juicy. Fairly pleasant once you get past the initial bite.
O - Overall an excellent beer, but I don't know if I can call it my favorite DIPA. Definitely glad to try it though! 1,186 charactersMarkIntihar, Jan 19, 2012

M. Medium body, coarse feeling, with a lightly dry finsh.
O. I love this beer. It's well balanced flavor, and an amazing smell. I could open a can of this and leave it in my bathroom as an air freshener! This is a super tasty beer.

Acquired via trade
Thanks, stig!
Very slightly hazed burnished, dark orange and amber with a thick, very light khaki colored head that leaves the walls of the glass completely covered in messy, sticky, irregular lace. Fantastic!
A hugely pungent tropical and citrus aroma explodes from the glass: biting, stinging grapefruit, strong orange, and huge amounts of tropical passion fruit aromas combine for a stellar combination along with a bit of pine. Incredible.
I can't say enough good things about the flavor of this beer. It's hugely tropical and citrus-forward, with enough malt to balance things out and make this remarkably drinkable. I can't stop gulping this stuff down! Not too bitter, but huge hop flavors present. The citrus flavors are more pineapple leaning than I would have guessed after smelling this beer. Slight caramel sweetness. Incredible!
Medium to full mouthfeel with moderate carbonation.
A truly perfect DIPA. This ranks with the best of the best (Yes, it's better than Pliny). 1,019 charactersehammond1, Jan 15, 2012

3.97/5  rDev -11%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5Pours a deep amber color with a meek off-white head. Retention is as expected for a 9% ABV beer, it settles to a splotchy film. Smell is of some sort of citrus, like an apricot or nectarine. Taste starts with smooth caramel malt and some more of that apircot taste. I get some resinous hops in the finish. Mouthfeel is slightly on the heavy side, with enough carbonation to give a playful feel. Overall, a great beer, but not in my top 5 for DIPAs. 448 charactersgkunkle, Jan 15, 2012

A: Appearance is cloudy copper with a tanish head. Light levels of lacing throughout the tasting.
S: Where do i start? Smells like pine, grapefruit, big on hop aroma. Overall, smells intense like a big DIPA should. Reminds me of Maharaja.
T: Grapefruit, pine, citra (?) hops, and tangerine. Get a little bit of the alcohol on the finish but just enough to know it's there.
MF: Medium mouthfeel with lower levels of carbonation (maybe felt that way due to the high ABV?) and a drier finish. Smooth.
O: This is one of my favorite Surly brews and DIPA's in general, i'm very fortunate to be able to find this locally. I cant help but compare it to Avery Maharaja which i think is fairly similar in style and complexity. I remember taking down a couple of growlers of this stuff with friends when it was called 16 Grit. Have loved it ever since.

Straight on copper colored liquid. Thick two finger off white head. Dissipates quickly. Some retention left, but hardly any lacing. Some sediment floats by. Reminds me of sea monkeys. Man I miss those.

Citrus roundhouse kick to the tongue. Sweet candy. Piney hop bite. Incredibly easy to drink.

Pours a clear golden orange but settles in the glass as a hazy amberish color. A massive off white head develops, so much so that it needs to settle for a good amount of time before the entire beer can be poured into the glass. Excellent fluffy lacing is left on the glass. 
The nose is full of huge, juicy tropical and citrus hops and can be detected as soon as the can is cracked. Pineapple is easily the most prominent aroma that comes through but it is far from the only one. Grapefruit and some lemon are here as well as a more subtle hit of pine. There is an overall sweetness that can most likely be attributed to the juicy hops and a bit of malt. But this one is all about the hops and the nose is exceptional.
The taste follows closely with nose. Big citrus and tropical fruit hops hit first with pineapple again leading the way. Some orange, mango and grapefruit are here as well. It's really just an explosion of juicy hops up front. The malt sweetness comes across more in the taste and lays a nice base for a good hit of pine. The pine brings a pleasant bitterness to the finish. The taste probably isn't as big or in your face as the nose but it's still outstanding.
The mouthfeel is probably the only drawback for me, as the carbonation is a bit lower than it seems it should be. It probably also contributes to the hops not having the bite in the taste that they do in the nose. Despite the lack of carbonation the beer never feels slick, oily or too big for the style.
Despite the mouthfeel, this is an outstanding beer. The hop flavors and aromas are excellent. With a bit more carbonation this beer would be in the running for the best DIPA I've ever had. 1,756 charactersms11781, Jan 10, 2012

Pours a fairly dark orange color with a solid 3 finger head that dissipates to a lingering bit of head and nice lacing.
Nose; citrus, floral, and tropical fruit overtones.
Taste; surprising balance actually, you don't get 9% at all! Sharp notes of citrus upfront with undertones of peaches, pineapple, and grapefruit. Has a nice malt back, a bit of caramel, some grainy notes all around finishing with a solid grassy bitterness.
Mouthfeel is oily yet crisp and has a great carbonation.
Overall; for me, this definitely deserves to be Surly's claim to fame. Have had a fair amount of their offerings and been quite underwhelmed but this is a top notch dipa with increadibly aroma, hop presence, and balance...glad I have a few more cans!

Appearance: Slight chill haze on a nice copper color. Head is off-white and sticky as can be. Dwindles to a small cap that lasts for most of the drinking process. Depth of color is lovely. 
Smell: Pine, grapefruit, and a slight underpinning of tropical fruits. Some pineapples sneaks through an almost pithy bitterness. Malts run on the sweet side and drop lovely notes of biscuit dough and bread crust. A touch of caramel brightens things up a bit and adds a depth to the sweetness. Loads of hops and it never lets up. As the beer warms the hops take on an oily characteristic. 
Taste: Sharp slap of pine and grapefruit give way to a slight tropical wave. Pithy bitterness lingers in the back. Big slick hops everywhere. The malts try to keep up, hinting at some sweetness and rounding the profile out with a nice dose of biscuit dough, but it's ultimately about the hops. Pine resin and grapefruit zest roll in and out of assaulting the tongue. 
Mouthfeel: Nice and smooth with a moderate body. The carbonation is on point. A touch dry at the end, but for a big beer, it drinks awfully nice.
Overall: One of the most well-executed DIPAs to date. Loads of hop flavor, but it never becomes too much. Malts come with just the right balance to keep it all on point. Tons of flavor and for the ABV, insane drinkability. 1,386 charactersGoblinmunkey7, Jan 07, 2012

A: Pours a hazy amber/copper color, with a dense creamy white head. Very sticky lacing.
S: HUGE citrus burst in the nose. A perfect blend of pineapple, grapefruit, and piney hop scents before I'm even done pouring the can. This is what a DIPA should smell like.
T: Taste absolutely backs up the aroma. Loads of sweet citrusy flavors backed up with a dry, piney finish. Nice bitterness from the hops to counteract the sweetness.
M: Surprisingly creamy mouthfeel. Carbonation is subtle, making this brew extremely smooth.
O: Absolutely a world class DIPA. This year's batch seems even better than past incarnations. So good, I think I'll just have to drink 1 more 708 charactersbrydeen, Jan 03, 2012

16oz can a little above fridge temp poured into a snifter. canned on 12/08/11 (less than 1 month old).
pours out a fairly clear burnt orange amber color with a huge 3 fingers of dense off white head. great thick head retention and sticky lace clings to 50% of the glass. 
wow! as soon as i put my nose to the can i knew this was going to be great. smells like im crushing a freshly picked hop in my hands, dank, resinous hop oils, fresh candied tangerine, a bit of grapefruit and fresh pine, floral. some caramel malt tries to balance, and a bit of alcohol is noticable. just slghtly vegetal as it warms.
amazing hop flavors, so fresh, maybe detecting simcoe? candied tangerine and grapefruit citrus and super fresh pine. dank, just slightly floral. caramel malt is definatly noticable, but hops rule here. alcohol is just noticable enough to add something good. 
such a slick oily feel, rolls over the palate so nicely. carbonation feels just right.
what a beer, tastes insanely fresh. maybe the best DIPA ever? thats hard to say but its definatly right up there with pliny for me. every hop head needs to do whatever they need to do to seek this out. great stuff. 1,217 charactersdogfishandi, Jan 01, 2012

4.7/5  rDev +5.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Opened this can after a long day at the office! Haven't had this in 2 years and decided it was time to enjoy again.
Abrasive pours a beautiful orange-yellow color with hints of red in the light. Not entirely clear with the slightest haze that seems to stand still in the brew, even after warming for 30 minutes! Bubbles at first for a nice copper head, and subsides to just a couple bubbles after a minute.
Aroma really grabs you right away. Huge bursts of caramel and toffee, blended with grapefruit. At first, the smell is much more hoppy, but then mellows into that traditional aroma profile of a DIPA quickly.
Taste is really just out of this world. First flavors are nutty and caramelly- almost like syrup. Then the burst of hops that follows is outstanding. Grapefruit and lemon are the highlights, but there is almost a faint maple syrup at the end. The flavor profile lingers, and lingers, and lingers...beautiful.
There's a reason this beer is so acclaimed.

Score: 100
16 oz can with a "canned on" date of 12/01/11 poured into a Sam Adams perfect pint glass.
Appearance: Pours a slightly hazy, translucent copper-orange color with a full finger of creamy cream colored head that slowly settles into a thin layer and thick ring around the glass. Amazing lacing. An absolutely gorgeous IIPA. 5/5
Smell: This one is extremely fresh and citrusy! I could smell the beer as I was pour it out of the can. Huge amounts of pine and zesty citrus. Lots of fresh grapefruit, lemons, tangerines, oranges and tropical fruit. A little caramel malt. Deep whiffs of the fresh, zesty citrus aromas really perk the smell receptors, just like Zombie Dust. Abrasive Ale's aroma rivals Heady Topper. 5/5
Taste: WOW. Huge of zesty grapefruit and pine flavors throughout. I wouldn't say this one has a "malty backbone," but a noticeable maltiness on the mid-palate counterbalances what would otherwise be an extreme citrus hop bomb of bitterness. That balance is nice, as it takes you to the edge of hoppiness and back before the finish. Huge notes of fresh lemon come out more and more as the beer layers. The citrus zestiness of the beer is like a bright sunshine of hops on the palate. A lingering lemony bitterness grows in the finish as the beer layers. 5/5
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, high carbonation. The carbonation really highlights the zestiness on the palate, making the bright, fresh citrus flavors "pop" on the tongue. Finishes dry and sharply bitter. 5/5
Overall: This is amazing imperial IPA -- the best I have had to date. This one takes you to the edge of fresh citrus hoppiness and back. An absolute must try beer. This is one tailor-made for hops heads.
Recommendation: Beer geeks need to seek this beer out; it lives up to the hype. This is a must try beer. Casual beer drinkers who are not hops averse should probably enjoy this one too, though I have found IPAs, and especially imperial IPAs, to be a poor "gateway" into craft beer for casual beer drinkers.
Pairings: I paired this one with beef shwarma, Mediterranean rice and tahini, and I thought the spiciness and hoppiness paired really well.
Cost: $15.99 for a four pack. 2,287 charactersjegross2, Dec 28, 2011

Flavor is smooth and creamy with a wonderful non-balance of hops over malt. A touch of steely caramel sweetness is all that's required, while the double IPA hop is left to lead the show. Lots of orange, as expected from the bill, grapefruit as well. It's like liquid Sweetbell. 
Met all my expectations, drinkable as an IPA and strong as a double. Full and creamy mouthfeel without becoming overly malty and sweet. Really solid. 665 charactersBretSikkink, Dec 28, 2011

There was more head retention that lingered on the sides of the glass as I drank it. The smell was pheonemenal. Not only could I smell the ubiquitous hops, but the signature furious malt bill is evident, too. The taste is much more hop forward than furious, but does maintain some balance. This beer rivals sculpin and pliny, but yet is an unquestioned original. The mouthfeel is good. Similar to furious, again, in that it isn't highly carbonated. But that works. First time I've tried this beer, had two cans and will put this up there with the best double IPAs you can find anywhere. 691 charactersPerHops, Dec 26, 2011

A - Pours a transparent copper/orange color with a decently thick 2 finger head. Retention is surprisingly good given the high abv. 
S - Piney and citric hoppy notes play against an ever present caramel malt foundation. The aroma is pungent, but invitingly so. 
T - Caramel and a spicy/peppery note open to an almost buttery/bread foundation. The resinous piney notes come through on the climax, and the alcohol finishes a bit sweet. Very well built and balanced. 
M - Medium bodied, and bit too smooth. Could stand a bit more carbonation. 
D - One of the most masterfully balanced IPA's I've had the pleasure of drinking. If you can, give this one a go. 714 charactersblakelive784, Dec 25, 2011
4.15/5  rDev -7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4This beer is a nice super drinkable pounder can double IPA, and I've never had one in this format. I love the can art made by ball corporation, many local friends work for them in Weirton, WV. Pours a pale amber copper hue with a light colore billowing off white head, fine even lacing traces the sides of my nonic pint glass. Aroma is full of vegetal, onion/garlic spiciness. I can only guess that there's Summit hops in here with the taste I'm getting. The flavor is nice, this beer was canned on 12/14/11 we're talking super fresh. No abv or IBU info on the can, I find that hard to believe. They so proudly offered up 6.2% abv ad 99 IBUs on the Furious can, why not the abrasive ale. Alcohol is evident especially as it warms, it doesn't ruin the experience it is just there. Overall a very special DIPA in the can, my first experience with this style in that format. Surly is brave, and somewhat abrasive, but I enjoyed this beer carbonation is sturdy and body is full with resinous oils in the mix. 1,004 charactersWVbeergeek, Dec 24, 2011
4.3/5  rDev -3.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Appearance - Dark copper red
Aroma - Piney and fresh. Cool and calm star fruit tease.
Taste - Hoppy bite, sharp and strong. Many different hop flavors.
Mouthfeel - Medium bodied. Nice drinking anytime. Great summer or winter beer.
Overall - I purchased a four pack and had two the first night.
I love a potent hop bite, but this was over the top even for me. Also, the price was pretty steep. 
Two nights later, I drank the other two. I again though that it was not balanced very well and was tilted one sided around the hops. 
A couple days later, I somehow craved Abrasive. 
I purchased another four pack and continued until they were gone. I started to really enjoy the refreshing and party-like taste of it. I started to dig the sharp bite.
I just purchased another four pack and am drinking the first one now.
Delicious.
What can I say? We all evolve.
If you love mass quantities of hops, get Abrasive soon, it's a seasonal. 933 charactersHopstout, Dec 24, 2011

A - Deep golden copper. Good amount of head that looks frothy and lingers. Good amount of head retention and even lacing just from the initial pour.
S - Loads of hops. Smells like someone squeezed tangerines into this aroma, along with bitter, piney hop notes. One of the better and more inviting combinations of floral and citrus hop aromas.
T - It's got hops, but the balance between the hops and the malt backbone really strike me. Allows the entire flavor to be bold at once. But the bitter hops sting a little, but are smooth and mellow at the same time from the sweet citrus hops. An addictive flavor. Like the smell, one of the best piney/citrus hop taste profiles I've encountered as well. Masterful job.
M - The feel is bold, but not astringent. Goes down quite smooth once the mouth gets a feel for the hop explosion. Good carbonation and quite drinkable.
O - This beer is spectacular. When fresh, one of the more complete IIPAs and shows the versatility of hop flavors and aromas. Great balance and a joy to drink. 1,158 charactersScrumtralecent, Dec 24, 2011

16oz can dated 12/2/11 poured into a snifter
A-Pours amber with a slight haze. One finger off white head that has good retention and leaves ample lace all the way down.
S-Very hoppy nose-pine resin and citrus (grapefruit mostly) are all I'm picking up. Can't notice any malt, but that's ok with me. This is a hopheads beer and it doesn't disappoint. Very aromatic and pleasing.
T-"Abrasive" fits this beer well. It is a hoppy assault on the palate. Following the nose, resinous and citrusy goodness bombard my taste buds with a nice bitter bite. I am picking up a bit of a caramel malt back that complements the hop explosion well.
M-Medium body and carbonation, slightly creamy at first but provides a dry finish.
O-This is an excellent DIPA. If you enjoy hops, this one is a must. This was my first Surly offering and it didn't disappoint. 883 charactersLerxst, Dec 24, 2011
4.59/5  rDev +2.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5This was had in my trusty shaker pint.
Appearance- Wow, dark for an IPA, auburn-copper in color with gold highlights and a hazy look to it. 
The head is about a half finger in width, slightly off-white. The cap is smooth and very puffy with little bubbles in the cap.
Smell- I could smell the glorious little green buds the moment I popped the can. The smells are HUGE and exploding out of the glass. It is almost all citrus: pink grapefruit, passion fruit, and some peach. Absolutely awesome.
Taste- This citrus bomb unloads on the grapefruit right away. And of course, it starts to bitter almost immediately. Some biscuit and wheat malt that starts to come out mid-drink and in the finish off-sets the pucker factor.
Some grassy hops and passion fruit just absolutely fill the mouth into the long finish. There is no alcohol noticeable in this big beer. Still loving it!
Mouth feel- Abrasive has a medium body, but is not really coating: slick and watery. The finish is pretty dry, but the drink is pretty smooth thanks to the malt.
Overall- An absolutely amazing beer! The citrus flavors are dangerously good. This offering from Surly is a must have if you are a hop head. 1,182 charactersPintofbrown, Dec 23, 2011

A: 1.5 finger head of lovely cream lacing, great thickness, and excellent retention for the ABV. Colour is a nontransparent light amber. 
Sm: A heavy hop aroma with some light cream. Pleasant and inviting. A strong aroma. 
T: Very hoppy but also quite nicely balanced, avoiding the pitfall of too much bitterness on the finish present in so many (bad) IPAs. I quite fancy it. The cream isn't quite as pronounced as I'd like, but it's there. Some light toasted malt seems to come through as well. 
Mf: Coarse and wet, suiting the flavours quite well. I'd like it a bit less coarse, but it's alright. 
Dr: Very drinkable for an IPA. I'd like to try it on draught. It's a nice little IPA, with a nicely balanced hop profile.

11/28/13: Truncated can review. 
Served into a stem-tulip in Minneapolis, MN. Expectations are high. Served cold, straight from the fridge. Side-poured with standard vigor. Reviewed as an imperial IPA because the description on the back identifies it as such. Canned 10/30/13. Reviewed live. 
A: No bubble show forms as it's poured. 
Pours a 1.5 finger wide head of white colour. Nice creaminess and thickness. Decent frothiness. Nice consistency. Head retention is good - about 5 minutes. No lacing clings to the sides of the glass as the head recedes. 
Body colour is a translucent quasitransparent copper of good glowing vibrance. No yeast particles are visible. 
Overall, it looks pretty good for an imperial IPA but isn't unique or special. No egregious flaws. I'm looking forward to trying it. 
Sm: Dank hop resins and pine character. Some complementary nectary hop character. Lighter floral and herbal tones. Plenty of hop oils. Pale malts. Sticky tree sap. Maybe some evergreen. It's a delightful and appealing hop profile with seemingly well-chosen hops. I'm really looking forward to trying it. A clean and inviting aroma of above average strength. 
No yeast character or alcohol is detectable, nor are any off notes.
T: Pine is definitely dominant, evoking pine needles, sap, and nectar. Floral and herbal hop character is subsidiary but effective. I do pick up some grapefruit and citrusy zest. Pale malts provide a supportive but unobtrusive foundation and keep the hop bitterness fairly well balanced without curbing the necessary hop bite too much. The malty side actually feels a bit candied. I'd like the hop bitterness to be a bit more tamed.
It's an extremely cohesive build, and even borders on gestalt. Enjoyable. I would like more depth of flavour, and the intensity of flavour is a bit low for the style. Flavour duration is excellent, leaving hop oils and accompanying bitterness lingering on the palate. Complex enough, but it could use more subtlety and intricacy. Not nuanced per se.
No yeast character or alcohol comes through. Never soapy. Very clean.
Mf: Crisp, smooth, wet, refreshing, pleasantly biting, and approachable. Oily. Well carbonated, if a bit intentionally overdone to accentuate its bite. Good thickness and body. Nice presence on the palate. Surprisingly soft. Complements the flavour profile well, with some limited custom-tailoring of texture to taste.
Not astringent, harsh, rough, boozy, hot, or gushed.
Dr: Very drinkable for an Imperial IPA. Surly is clearly one of the big dogs when it comes to hoppy beers, and I always dig their deliberate considered hop choices. I'll burn through this 4-pack without any trouble. Perhaps my favourite thanksgiving brew.

A: Poured into my Surly Imperial Pint glass, this beer is a great deep golden color with hues of reds shining through. There is about one and a half fingers of head that take awhile to settle.
S: The nose on this beer is huge pine, tropical fruits, and just a tough of citrus. I'm picking up mango, pineapple, and some lemon. There is also an underlying malty sweetness.
T: This beer starts off with a hit of pine right off the bat. In fact, there is a touch of onion (but only for like a second). The tropical fruits and citrus come through in the middle and finish, respectively.
M: Medium bodied beer. It starts off wet and finishes just a touch dry. The flavors swirl around the palate mixing well together throughout.
O: This is a really good beer, especially if you're a Hop Head, but it's not my favorite. I'll take a Furious over an Abrasive, 9 times out of 10. 934 characterstrxxpaxxs, Dec 23, 2011

S: Pure juicy grapefruit with a little pine, but completely citrus forward. Some sweet malts cut the bitterness of the hops perfectly. The smell is up there with the best in the style.
T: Spicy, peppery notes lead, followed closely by a citrus hop explosion, and then some pine residuals. The bready, biscuity malts are much more pronounced in this AIPA than in most others I've had and they really work to cut the hops off in the aftertaste (although there are hints of some dryhopping). I love hops, and I really enjoy this beer, but I think that Abrasive would be a great AIPA for someone who prefers maltier beers. The way the bitterness is cut is extremely intereting and as it's happening, the hops almost turn a little sour before the malts take over. Very complex.
M: Viscous, as the style precludes, with some light carbonation (could be a little more), and a dry aftertaste. The alcohol is very well hidden and only comes through in the buzz you get after a couple sips. Wow. 1,205 charactersHeavenisbeer, Dec 22, 2011

Pours an orangish copper with a small head that quickly dissipates to a nice cap and ring, minimal lacing. 
Before I even finished the pour, an amazing Citra hop aroma filled the room, mangoes, citrus, very tropical. The beer literally smelled like the Citra hops I used in a batch of homebrewed pale ale last weekend. A touch of caramel malt and yeast esters barely make their presence known. 
The taste is all hops up front.... Grapefruit, mango, papaya, maybe a hint of peach. There's also a sweetness here that present the hops in a candy-like form. Fruity esters only enhance the tropical fruit hop flavors... The slightest bit of warming from the alcohol only reminds you of this beer's abv, but you quickly forget that and take another sip. What an amazing double IPA!
Mild carbonation and a clean, slightly lingering bitter aftertaste only make this brew MORE drinkable. The mouthfeel's actually pleasant and light, much like a smaller sessionable pale ale. Very nice. 
Overall, this is one killer brew. Loads of amazing hop character, enough maltyness to balance it nicely, and man, its gotta be the easiest drinking 8.8%abv beers out there. Easily my favorite double IPA, period. 1,227 charactersNordeastBrewer77, Dec 22, 2011

Canned on 12/01/11. Poured into my Darkness tulip.
A- Wonderful! This puts out a beautiful burnt orange colour, with a fluffy white head on top. Leaves a bit of lace behind, with the head dissipating down to an eighth of an inch, and has remained that way for the duration of the beer.
S- Loads of resiny hops up from, along with a wave of tropical fruit. Not quite as dank as some hop aromas, but still pretty nice.
T- This is where Abrasive shines! A near perfect example of what a Double IPA was meant to be. More of the tropical fruit from the nose comes forward here, and you get just enough caramel/malt body to feel like this beer is the complete package. Lots of mango, peach, pineapple, and grapefruit going on here, and it's very delicious.
M- For as great as this beer tastes, I think it gets spoiled ever so slightly by a lingering bitterness. I wouldn't say that its overly bitter, but combined with the fact that I can taste a bit of the abv makes this beer fall short of greatness. Other than that, great carbonation, and great body.
O- Overall, another great hopped up offering from Surly. Doesn't quite get my pinkies twealing like Wet does, but it's pretty darn close. Abrasive, I hope we meet again in the near future. 1,371 charactersmuskabeatz, Dec 22, 2011
4.97/5  rDev +11.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Canned on 12/1/11.
Pours a clear and brilliant body, copper penny in color. Billowing, light tan head covers the beer, slowly settling to a half of a finger cover, thick and creamy looking. Leaves some nice lacing on its way down.
Loads of stone fruit and tangerines on the nose. Bright, honey like floral tones. There's also an earthy, redwood bark hop aroma in there too. Merest whiff of caramel malts.
Lives up to it's name sake right away, with a big punch of hop bitterness. Dank, oily hops give this a wet hop feel to it. Tons of spices pop up, and the fruit profile leans more towards a citric sourness. Malts are found quivering in the corner, only providing a framework for the hops to ride on. The finish is very bitter, with a good dose of alcohol to add to the bite.
Aptly named. What a beer! Definitely the best thing I've had by Surly so far. Excellent. 871 characterslitheum94, Dec 21, 2011

A- Pours a slightly hazy amber with a two finger head that leaves some nice lacing behind.
S- Right after opening, the aroma smacks you in the face with tons of ripe peaches and malt sweetness. At first it reminds me of peaches and cream. More tropical fruits follow with guava, passion fruit, mango, orange, pink grapefruit as well as pine needles. Damn, this aroma is unbelievable. 
T- Big citrusy hops upfront with pink grapefruit and orange. At first the citrus notes seem to be overpowering but then are followed by some mango, lemon, pine, grass and some caramel malt at the finish.
M- Medium carbonation and body with a creamy mouthfeel. Would never have guessed this beer has a 9% ABV
O- I was worried that I was going to be disappointed with this beer because I have built the hype up so much in my head. Thankfully, this beer delivered on all fronts. One of the best DIPAs I've had period. I have to get more. 996 charactersiadler, Dec 20, 2011

The pour shows me a copper coloured brew with a 2 finger head of foam and nice lacing. Hehe, the foam just never quits; impressive for a higher abv brew.
The smell is simply outstanding. Wave after wave of tropical fruit, pine, grapefruit, with some sweet fruitiness there as well. 
The taste shows very aggressive hop forward flavours of tropical fruit and pine and grapefruit but all are at a certain level that screams drinkability. There's a light flavour of some sweet malt that could have been over done, considering the style, but Surly kept it more to add some balance than to steal top billing. Well crafted? You darn tootin!
Lightish on the carbonation and silky smooth, there are few DIPAs that I've tried that can match Abrasive's mouthfeel and...where the heck is the 9%abv? I would have never guessed how strong it is if: 1) I didn't know it was a DIPA and 2) I read about it on BA.
A simply marvelous brew that is anything but simple. One of the best beers of 2011 for me... 1,068 charactersBitterbill, Dec 18, 2011

S- Piny hop aroma dominates the nose, with hints of citrus coming through.
T- Just as bitter as the name suggests, with big piney hops up front, followed with mild grapefruit and honey flavors, wrapped up nicely with toasty malt undertones.
M- Hoppy bitterness coats the tongue, lingering long after the last sip. May be a bit much for some, but is to be expected in a beer so aggressively hopped.
O- Crisp, bitter, yet still refreshing. Rich and flavorful, and complex without being too overwhelming. A must have for hop-heads. 609 charactersstpaulsipper07, Dec 18, 2011

Pours a slightly cloudy deep copper color with a smallish off white head that shows moderate retention and lace. Smells of hops, tastes like em too. Lots of pine and citrus and floral hops with a faint bit of bready malt sulking deep in a dark corner. A bit of malt breaks through in the flavor but is quickly sent to its room by the onslaught of pine and citrus. Medium body and level of carbonation with a slick resinous almost sticky mouthfeel. Damn good beer right here, although I don't find it horribly abrasive as advertised. Then again I've spent the last few years building up an immunity to Iocane powder, I mean lupulin. 693 charactersjohnnnniee, Dec 18, 2011

A- Pours a golden-orange with a finger and a half of tight, off-white head. Leaves some decent lacing and sticks around pretty nicely.
S- Big citrus hops, piney resins, juicy tropical fruits - mango, peach, and a bit a bready malts. No trace of alcohol.
T- Really aggressive piney bitterness followed by some of the citrus from the nose. Some digging reveals tropical fruits, alcohol, and a bit of bready malt as well. *Edit* As it reaches room temp, big tropical/citrus fruit flavors become more evident. Bumping score to reflect.
M- Semi-aggressive carbonation, but this is a palate wrecker. Medium bodied.
O- Really good DIPA. Is it the best one I've had? No. Is it worth the hype? I'd also say no, but if you can get it or trade for it without giving up your first born I'd recommend trying it. 849 charactersstxSS07, Dec 17, 2011

T: Pine, grapefruit, mango, juicy clementine, some resin and spice, with a lengthy caramel finish with moderate bitterness. Good balance, not quite a hop bomb.

16 oz can into Long Trial "Vermont Pint" glass.
Plenty of off-white foam, nice sticky lacing. 
Strictly a hop thing in the nose. It's not all over the place either, all citrus, some pith, a bit of ruby grapefruit juice and a touch of pine.
If it tasted as good as it smelled, I think it'd be a 5 for both, but the aroma gets diminished by the slightly one dimensional taste and as it sits smells more like grapefruit and less like anything else. Would have liked some semblance of malt/body but the overall lightness of this does lend itself to a perfect mouth feel especially when coupled with the crisp finish. 
Damn good. If it were plentiful in my neck of the woods it' would be in my fridge constantly. If you're sending me a box feel free to add a couple cans!

Aroma is a huge burst of grapefruit, mango, papaya, pineapple, pine... delicious tropical goodness, one of the best-smelling beers I've ever inhaled.
Taste is piney, citrusy and brightly bitter. More brash and less tropical than the nose, but still very tasty.
Overall this is an in-your-face - abrasive - DIPA that doesn't hold back. I'm most impressed by the incredible aroma but I'd buy this regularly if it was available in my market. 623 charactersdraheim, Dec 14, 2011

s- grapefruit and other citrus, some definite pine resin and mango sweetness. just a tiny hint of caramel malt backbone
t- pine resin and citrus. maybe some lemon and just a hint of pepper. just a hint of malt sweetness and finishes hoppy bitter and resin. a hop bomb all the way
m- carbonation is right on for the style. finish is a bit dry and bitter, but expected for the style. drinkablity is great considering its 9% and there are a boatload of hops
overall, a very nice dipa. surly has yet to make a bad beer. unfortunately, this is a pretty limited seasonal release and quite expensive. a good beer, but at that price, i can find equal or better brews at a much better value 1,027 characterscrewfan16, Dec 14, 2011

T- A big ol kick of hops. Grapefruit more than anything, but there is some resinous pine and a touch of mango as well. A touch of sweetness in the finish but this is just straight up hops.
M- Carb fairly high. Sits firm on the tongue. Initially sticky but there's just a bit of drying to it.
O- This is a big beer with the kitchenload of hops. Given the choice, I would actually give a slight edge to Surly Wet, but this is still a very very good hop bomb. 641 charactersjsprain1, Dec 14, 2011

Thin, off-white head quickly recedes to a few medium-sized bubbles clinging to the periphery. Orange-amber elixir. Not much lacing, typical of a high ABV brew.
From the first pop of this can the hoppy goodness exudes. Pine, resin, grapefruit, mango, AHH...Hops!
A sweet/bitter battle over my taste buds. Certainly the bitterness predominates and starts at the tip of the tongue washing back like a spiked glove. Citra forward, crushing the warrior hops. Almost a bubble gum-like flavor battles the resinous hops to a standstill.
Well carbonated, medium body, alcohol well hidden.
Bravo! Once again Surly kicks it. 722 charactersCaptCleveland, Dec 13, 2011

Amazing aroma! Orange zest, pineapple, mango. Sweet and spicy. Notes of caramel and honey in the background, but it is all about the hops.
Loads of sticky hops in the flavor. Much more pine and grapefruit in the flavor. A little less tropical. Sticky resiny bitter finish. Honey and caramel notes still in the background, but nicely balanced for what it is. 
As it warms the pine and spice does come out more in the aroma, and malt has a larger presence in the flavor. Some notes of toast and oats.
Slick and smooth but with plenty of carbonation. Sticky hop resin coats the mouth and stays there.
Overall an awesome IPA. I'm loving the citra/warrior combo. Though the malt bill is relatively complex in the recipe, it is sort of hidden beneath loads and loads of hops...not a bad thing though. 920 characterssjccmd, Dec 11, 2011

Appearance - Very Hazy Dark Amber Color with a slightly brighter shade of orange at the bottom. There's fair amount of carbonation in here too. Head pours a large foamy 4 finger width with ALOT of sticky lacing on the side and takes a while before it the head starts to settle.
Smell - Woah, this is a very hoppy smelling beer, even more so than Surly's other seasonal IPA, Wet. There's also some very fruity notes in there as well, almost like an apple-fruity scent. I can also smell some malts in here as well, but it's over-shadowed by the sheer hops in here. The overall smell reminds me of Wet, but much more fruitier
Taste - The hops in the flavor are actually not as strong as they are in the smell, but the hops are still relatively strong. The fruity/apple & malty notes also gives this beer a unique flavor of it's own but in a good way. It gives very hoppy beer a sweet sort of flavor. The aftertaste is surprisingly dry with some mild fruity and hoppy notes. The fact this beer has a dry aftertaste considering all of the flavors at work here is very impressive in it's own right!
Mouthfeel - It's slightly heavy in terms of body, but relatively light on carbonation, making this a surprisingly easy to drink IPA. Impressive considering it's hop content and ABV.
Overall - Surly makes exceptional beers consistently and this beer is no different. It's not as intense as say Surly Wet is, but that's fine because its created it's own unique flavor! IPA and Hop lovers will find great joy in Abrasive Ale! Every IPA lover NEEDS to try this beer! 1,585 charactersNuclearDolphin, Dec 10, 2011

Poured from the Surly pint can into my Darkness snifter for effect. 
It produced a dense, white, 2-finger head. Super solid retention and some very fine lacing. Poured a slightly hazy, reddish-copper. 
Wow, I think I've died and gone to hop heaven. Juicy, tropical fruits dominate. So complex; mango, pineapple, grapefruit, probably more exotic fruits I've never had. There is a touch of pine in there as well, along with some subtle caramel sweetness. This may be the best smelling beer I've ever had. Skol Surly!
The taste follows suit. This is a true hop-heads beer. Loads of fruity hops upfront, slightly sweet in the middle, bitter throughout. Not as complex a hop profile as the nose, but a very nice malt backing comes in and you get a touch of alcohol.
Smooth for 9% and 120 IBUs, but still more of a sipper. Medium mouthfeel, dry overall, and moderate carbonation. It flirts with being cloying, but seems to avoid it. 
Overall this an incredible DIPA and, in my opinion, right up there with Pliny (I haven't tried Heady Topper). Recommended to all who can get it. I feel lucky and privileged to live in the same city as a brewery as skilled as Surly. Cheers! 1,213 charactersHumulus85, Dec 09, 2011

S: Fruit punch hop aroma. This smells like a great hop bill this year.
T: First starts out with strong grapefruit like hops. I tend to think the dry hops were different than the flavoring hops. The initial hop fades into some malt sweetness that balances well with the hops at this point the bittering hops hit the back of the tongue. The finish is sweet fresh tasting malt. The alc. is hidden until the warmth hits the tummy. Quite a ride!
M: Actually this actually feels fairly dry considering a 9% alc. The carbonation dances the flavors across the palate.

4.42/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5About an inch of cloud-white foam. Looks a deep copperish-ruby red. Smells absolutely amazing. Deep, deep citrus with tropical notes everywhere. Lots of grapefruit and an underpinning of malt and grain. Tastes fantastic. I remember past Abrasives being more, well, abrasive. This drinks like juice. Fairly light to start and then it slowly coats the palate in an equally-sweet / equally bitter wash, with lots of citrus, but an equal amount of malt. Neither flavor dominates, but rather collaborate to great effect. Normally, this wouldn't be notable, though the flavor is huge. You feel the tide could tip in either direction, but the flavor holds firm and ends in a slightly resinous fade. This is a strong, citrusy DIPA that should not be missed.

It pours a copperish color with a frothy white head.
The smell is awesome. Tons and tons of mango, persimmon, papaya all wrapped up in a nice sugar cane like sweetness.
The flavor follows. Sweet and tropical with a nice piney bitterness on the back end.
Perhaps a bit sweet but a nice tropical IPA, surely not abrasive, a bit cloying, but otherwise easy to drink. 521 characterscrossovert, Dec 08, 2011

4.47/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A great DIPA...obtained in a trade with Woodchopper. Poured into a pint glass from a 16 oz can. Good looking beer. Hazy orange/light copper color. Big off white head that fades to a covering of the glass. Extensive light lacing on the glass.
Smell is top shelf. Strong citrus hops grapefruit and tangerine. Taste is more of the same. Strong grapefruit and tangarine flavors. The bitterness is good but not a real head shrinker. I couldnt detect the malt flavors but there is enough malt here to balance out the bitterness.
Mouthfeel is rich and crisp. No alcohol burn. As I got to the end, I thought I detected some Summit hops (which is not a good thing for a small percentage of the beer drinking population) but this was very faint.
Overall this is a great DIPA. I would look forward to this as much as Blind Pig, Maharajah or other top notch DIPA. 854 charactersJayQue, Nov 23, 2011

reviewed from notes taken on dec 2010
poured into tulip
Color: Almost orange, Some gold highlights come through when held to the light. A nice 2 finger white head form and it leaves behind some solid lacing.
Nose: Big fruit! Melon,peach,apricot,and mellow pineapple. Also you get the big hop profile of this beer.... quite piney, but also some sweetness rises from this brew.
Palate: Sticky and a bit boozy! The hops explode on the tongue, but then are washed away by the the gentle sweetness of this brew. The fruit also shines here as the melon and peach textures take over one the hoppy body is washed away. The carbonation is solid and the abv is masked well enough to make this DIPA quite drinkable.
Finish: Long and a bit bitter. Probably the weakest portion of the beer for me. Not as complex as I would like it to be, but still a very solid DIPA.

4.92/5  rDev +10.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5The Abrasive Ale is my favorite overall Surly brewed beer. Too bad it's seasonal.
This beer pours out of Surly's staple pint aluminum cans. Pours a beautiful golden orange color. Does have a little head and has a wonderful citrus and hoppy smell.
The taste is absolutely amazing. Very "abrasive" hoppiness, but, has such a wonderful citrus flavor. Flavors of grapefruit and tangerine. Never was really a fan of either fruit until enjoying this beer. But this is such a well balanced and complex beer.
Another must try of the Surly arsenal. Again, too bad this is seasonal. But I guess it adds to the excitement.
Enjoy! 622 charactersDogfishRyan, Aug 28, 2011
4.47/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.516oz can poured into a tulip.
A: Pours a golden-amber color with a two-finger off-white head that has very good retention. Dissipates very slowly leaving behind considerable lacing.  Nice, but pretty typical at this point.
S: Very sharp aroma with aromatic hops manifesting themselves through citrus and pine resin.  Sweet tropical fruits of tangerine, orange, and mango, and bitter grapefruit rinds are prominent.  A solid malt backbone is present too; smells like my wife's yeast bread before she puts it in the oven.  Very, very aromatic. 
T: The flavors really fight each other on this ... it starts out malty/bready and slightly sweet.  Fresh, doughy bread with caramel.  It transitions quickly to the delicious citrus fruits, exactly in line with the aroma.  The sweetness is still slightly evident, giving it a great deal of complexity.  The bitterness is amped up at the finish, leaving much of the sweetness behind, and ending with citrusy hops, grapefruit rinds, and pine resin.  Really well done. 
M: Medium bodied and slightly sticky, coating the palate well.  Soft carbonation that creates a nice smoothness without being prickly or tingly.  Pretty drying finish, but it's not overpowering, which is a definite plus, in my book.  Alcohol is hidden perfectly, which is dangerous for a beer this well crafted. 
D: This is really fantastic.  Great aroma, flavor, and mouthfeel, and balanced perfectly.  Definitely competes for a spot in my top favorite DIPAs, and rightfully so.  Get this if you can! 1,533 charactersMississipping, Aug 17, 2011
4.82/5  rDev +8.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A review off of several cans kept in fridge since purchase. Earliest ones were drank as fresh as possible.
Orangish gold body with a huge white head. Leaves great lacing down the glass.
First hit with huge citrus fruits, maybe orange or tangerine, lots of caramel sweetness follows
Delicious citrusey goodness from the hop blend. Sweet up front with a lingering bitterness that coats the tongue. Not too much yeast influence. 
Very good mouthfeel. Not sure what would be better
Abrasive earned its spot as one of my favorite beers. Since first buying these a few months ago they've definitely fallen off a bit, but even slightly aged Abrasive is a top-tier beer 666 characterszachary80, Aug 17, 2011
4.79/5  rDev +7.4%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.516oz can poured into a Victory Golden Monkey snifter. Canned on 3/21/11.
A: Pours a fairly clear orangey amber color. Off white almost tannish finger and a half head. Comes down fairly quickly but leaves some lacing.
S: It smells SO floral! Pineapple, overripe peach, other citrus fruits, etc. The nose is just amazingly sweet smelling! Really don't get much malts behind it.
T: Wow! This is an amazing beer! You definitely get those floral hops right on the tip of the tongue. It really changes in the middle of the mouth. It almost gets smooth with some malts in the middle. The close is the customary hop astringency and bitterness your expecting. I don't "taste" the booze, but on an empty stomach I feel it a little.
M: Medium bodies but leading to full. The flavors really coat the mouth.
O: Even with some age on this age, its a world class beer that definitely stands up to the likes of Pliny and Alpine stuff. Furious and this are stupendous brews! 962 charactersinlimbo77, Aug 15, 2011
4.47/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Rich aroma is quite hoppy with an overtone of citrus, about equal parts grapefruit and orange, and just a little bit sweet. It pours an attractive orange-amber with a very thick off-white head. Strongly hoppy flavor has an evergreen overtone, a fair amount of bitterness, and more than a hint of citrus with just a touch of fruity sweetness. Lively texture is fairly fizzy and leaves an edgy evergreen finish. How can anybody be abrasive after this one? Look for it, trade for it! 480 charactersCyberkedi, Aug 11, 2011
4.62/5  rDev +3.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5EDITED on Jan. 15, 2016 with 0.25 increments from 4.72 to 4.62. 
Poured from a can into a pint. Color was amber/copperish. Probably a ¾-inch head with lots of good looking film that lasted throughout. 
Powerful smell. Heavy on the hops. Seems to be some kind of citrus in there, maybe grapefruit? Pineapple? So good to the nose. 
Strong alcohol taste, but not as much as I thought. Impressively smooth. Lots of flavors coming together from caramel/chocolate to either that slight citrus flavor. The smoothness trumps all.
Mid-to-high carbonation. I can’t mention smooth enough. 
Just a terrific beer. If you see it somewhere, pounce on it. 647 charactersBucannonXC5, Aug 11, 2011
3.69/5  rDev -17.3%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3 |  overall: 3.5Poured from 16oz can acquired in trade
Can dated 2/28/11
Aroma: Musky grapefruit, mango, peach nectar, and sweet honey. Fantastic aroma.
Appearance: Hazy orange peach nectar-colored body. Off-white one finger of head disappears relatively quickly. A small amount of lacing sticks to the glass, but less than is ideal.
Flavor: Hop flavors similar to the aromas I noted. Sweet, fruity, maltiness aims to provide balance to the substantial hoppy bitterness. Strong bitterness clings to the tongue through the finish, almost resembling the dry, tannic bitterness of dark chocolate or espresso.
Mouthfeel: Medium carbonation and medium body. Hops are a bit drying to the tongue/palate
Overall: The name "Abrasive" is definitely fitting! The malt bill tries to make a run at the extreme hop profile, but doesn't stand a chance. A bit too bitter for my liking, but I'm glad to have tried it. Would be interested in trying this one side-by-side w/ Hopslam in February! 965 charactersmdvatab, Jul 29, 2011

pours cloudy amber; immense off-white head, crazy lacing on the glass. aroma - in a word, epic. citrus-pine explosion. i half-expected a dry-hop bag to spill out of the can. there's certainly some maltback in there, but really, who cares??? i could almost get-by just smelling this beer. hop-head dream.
taste - lots of subtler hop notes after the initial olfactory blast - pineapple, tropical fruit, grapefruit. reasonable amount of caramel malt, nice tight finish. great mouthfeel, very well done carbonation.
love this beer, if i were in the great lakes area, it'd be a camping stand-by for me. 640 charactersrobbrandes, Jul 25, 2011

Excellent DIPA. Aroma bursts of tropical fruits and citrus. Reminds me a bit of Double Trouble but better. 
Taste is creamy and tropical. Not much pine or grapefruit here. This seems to be a pure tropical hop bomb, which is very nice. Abv is well hidden and this is extremely drinkable. 
Mouthfeel is perfect. Creamy and full bodied. This is a delicious DIPA. It would certainly be in my top 10. Too bad it is not constantly available. 469 charactersBarlow, Jul 07, 2011

4.36/5  rDev -2.2%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5A Hugenormous thanks to Torgo for this generous extra.
Deep copper in color, off white; moderately thin creamy head. 
Smell is equal parts grapefruit, pine, and black pepper. It also has a light honey smell in here as well.
Taste has pine and grapefuit up front, with the pine being the more prominent flavor, then theres an intermingling of sweet alcohol towards the middle and finishes with a load of hop bitterness which lingers at the back of the mouth.
Mouthfeel is a bit slick, moderately watery, and has some moderate to high carbonation throughout. 
Overall a great IIPA and I really appreciate the chance to try it, thanks again Torgo. 649 charactersSTEG, Jul 01, 2011

Review adapted from notes taken 2/3/11
Appearance: Cloudy, hazy amber orange with sticky lacing
Smell: The aroma of this beer is great from the second the can is cracked to the end - leafy, grassy, herbal, some citrus (grapefruit) - hops are complex, and so are the malts - toasted, caramel, interesting
Taste: Very interesting - a great level of bitterness with a bitter aftertaste and a lingering sense of bitter - malts are both pale and caramel, with hints of cooked malts that remind me of molasses - they are remarkably heavy - hops are tasty - resin, grapefruit - overall, it's very good, but it is a bit too malty for what I am looking for
Mouthfeel: Feels heavy even for a DIPA, sticky mouthfeel, a surprising (and nice) lack of alcohol
Overall: A unique DIPA
I rarely encounter Double/Imperial IPAs that attempt to achieve balance. I feel that Abrasive does very well in this respect, but the result is that I thought it was a bit too heavy. I thought it could pass as a hyper-hoppy barleywine, but sadly I have not encountered anyone who agrees with me. Regardless... it's still borderline amazing. 1,153 charactersangrybabboon, Jun 29, 2011

5/5  rDev +12.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I don't know why it's taken so long to get this down. This is one of the few amazing beers that would be on that list if you could bring a few things to a desert island. Poured from a can dated from March.
A: Super sticky lacing with a nice one inch foamy head. Rolls through itself like a clear Minnesotan Guinness. Medium amber color with no intention of leaving the side of your glass. What a beauty.
S: Can I give this a ten? Aromatic hops fill your nose like a fresh bag of green. Whiffs of tropical fruit and sweet green hops, hops, hops. This beer has an intoxicating aroma. Hard to stop smelling it.
T: Fruits Hops Sunshine Jesus. I think the acrid sour on the end just smacks me a bit hard like a rough girlfriend, but I love it. I think my taste buds will be retired for a week. Sweet resin and hardcore goodness. This is not for the timid. I think with every sip a Chuck Norris has been killed.
M: Again ten stars or better. You can almost feel the lacing in your mouth. Acrid thickness. This is how every beer should feel. There's a party in mouth. Sticky. sticky, acrid love.
O: I'd give this beer a million stars if I could. It is where the bar is set for less amazing beers. It's hard to compare this to anything. I am sad to only have a few cans of this left until December. Bravo Surly this is one of the beers that hooked me on you. 1,355 charactersucis, Jun 20, 2011

M- Drinks smooth and easy. tooo easy.
O- I was very happy to try this beer. If it was local, I would buy it all the time. The price/value is incredible with this beer. I wouldn't put it up there with hopslam and the like, but it is still incredible beer. This would hit the spot most any day of the week. I hope to find more.

T: Hops, understandably, completely overwhelm everything else, with tons of spice, pine, and resin. Some light bready malt and grapefruit sneak in on the tail end, and it's closed out by intense bitterness. Tasty, but a little less than amazing.
M: Rich and supple, with medium body and carbonation. Very good.
O: I'm a huge Surly fan and a huge DIPA fan, so I was extremely excited to crack this can. While I can't really say that I was disappointed, since I truly enjoyed the beer, it really didn't blow me away. The hops were still extremely potent, so age wasn't the culprit - it just didn't have the right hop profile for my tastes. While it lived up to its name, I want more than sheer resinous bitterness out of the style, and this beer was a little lopsided in that direction. For hop-bombs in cans, give me Furious, Wet, or Gandhi-Bot any day of the week.

4.25/5  rDev -4.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Big thanks to Cuzco for this exciting extra! Date on can is 03/21/11.
Pours a very nice golden orangey honey hue that is slightly hazy. A conservative creamy white had builds up, but most of it says goodbye rather quickly.
Aroma is very big and aggressive, which is what I hope for in a DIPA. Giant piney notes like I'm hanging out in a tree. Very pronounced aroma, super hoppy. If a hop cone were to start sweating, this is what I imagine that'd smell like.
Taste is much the same. Big piney hops punch you in the face immediately and don't back down. Some grapefruit rind bitterness follows, which is pretty intense. Not really getting some of the fruitiness others have mentioned, which is a bit disappointing. Just really damn hoppy. Alcohol isn't too prevalent for 9%.
Nice carbonation, and I'd say medium bodied. It works well with the intensity.
Overall, this is extremely hoppy and a good representation of a straight-to-the-point DIPA. Hops, hops and more hops. No bullshitting around here. 1,004 charactersjefferz5000, Jun 12, 2011
5/5  rDev +12.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Served in a Alesmith Snifter.
A- Deep golden orange. Leaves nice lacing on the glass.
S- Amazing. Sweet, citrus with some orange, grapefruit, and papaya. 
T- Sweet caramel malts. Orange and grapefruit comes in the middle followed my a nice pine hop balance. Bitter but not overpowering.
M- Medium bodied for 9%. Has some resin and leaves a bid of a dry mouth.
O- Just an amazing DIPA. This is exactly what I love about IPA’s is the balance between sweet malts and citrus hops with just a perfect amount of bitterness. Don’t know how this isn’t in the top 5 DIPA’s. 577 characterskawilliams81, Jun 04, 2011

Dated 3/21/11
A hard pour into my DFH snifter produces a finger of off white head which recedes leaving a thin ring and minimal lacing.The beer is a dark, cloudy amber to orange color. The nose is pure citrus. Mango, orange and tangerine jump out at me. There is a subdued sweet malt presence as well, but the hops really shine here. Taste is a very balanced mixture of citrus hops and sweet bready malt. Grapefruit, orange and mango predominate. The finish is juicy and bitter at the same time with a mildly bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy without being at all cloying. Overall this is a wonderful DIPA from surly. One of my all time favorites, which I seek out every year. Recommended. 760 charactersSideswipe, May 31, 2011

Drank from my Duvel Tulip
A - Pours a really nice Hazy copper colour witha n off White head that retains well and laces.
S - Sweet mango and hops with citrus as well.
T - Quite a yeasty brew up front with some massive hops and citrus totally smashing my palate to a pulp. The finish is very smooth yet a little bitter with an Orange peel flavour and texture that just lingers on and on. This is a massive DIPA.
M - Medium body and carbonation.
D - I had a PTE before this but its not as good. The mouthfeeel and sheer aggressive nature of this beer gives me an A+ 590 characterseric5bellies, May 29, 2011

A: 16oz can wrapped in aluminum foil and topped with standard pull tab. So I pulled the tab and poured out some honey colored ale. Maybe a drop of vamp blood in there, but pretty washed-out. Transient fine white foam finds resolve as a thin, broken sheet of a surface - but collared. Quantity of lace is equivalent to a Paris Hilton personal film: none. (3.5)
S: Hops. IPA. Grapefruit among other citric rinds. Slightly sweet nose candy of a malt profile. I’m guessing that there’s quite a bite to this one. An unbaked bread smell - doughy. I keep thinking I can smell more and more...tangerine? Excited. (3.5)
T: The dough is the first thing I taste. Then flanking of bitter and spicy hops roll over my palate and the beer may even be over douching the beer with hops. Tannic. As the beer warms up the bitterness dies out a bit and the beer becomes relatively sweet. (4)
M: Medium body with low carbonation. Dry finish only slight heat (guessing ABV in the 7% range). I think maybe my teeth dislike this beer - the enamel is flecking off. (3.5)
O: Still guessing IPA and this one is sweet and definitely drinkable. Actually reminds me of Dale’s Pale Ale (also an IPA). 1,195 charactersharrymel, May 28, 2011

S: Unbelievable. As others have said, if you can get this kind of flavor for a can, more breweries need to look into canning their beers. Huge notes of mango, pine, citrus hops and apricot. Slightly reminiscent of Sculpin.
T: The balance in this is perfect. Big citrus hop presence with some notes of candied grapefruit and a slight bit of white pepper. Caramel malts and some mango come in on the finish, which is smooth and sweet without being too sweet. 575 charactersnotchucknorris, May 24, 2011

S: Hops, Hops, and more Hops with a back grind of citrus notes. Did this really just get poured from a can?
T: Again... a canned brew? If I poured this beer in a glass and gave it to you at a pub you would think you were having it on draft. Yet this is out of a month old can. Perhaps brewers better begin looking into canning IPA a bit more. Just a fantastic explosion of hops and citrus. 
M: Like washing your mouth with hops. Good carb - great color
D: Could easily put down a couple of four packs in one sitting, ridiculously easy to drink. In my dream they have these in 6 packs and even 12 packs at the local store. 722 charactersDJButters, May 24, 2011
4.62/5  rDev +3.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Big thank you to Schmoopsbeer who gave me one of these in a trade
A- Poured can to pint glass produces a half finger head. Dissapates quick leaving little lacing. Golden-copper color that is slightly hazy.
S-Pine, grapefruit, orange, orange zest, slightly sweet also
T- I have to admit, as much as I was looking forward to trying this beer, I was also slightly skeptical about it. This put all skepticism to rest because it lived up to it's praise and more in my opinion. Pine, sweet grapefruit, and tangerine with tropical hints reminicent of BP Sculpin. Slightly bitter finish and slightly dry as well. There is a pleasent slight sweetness on the backend also. I am extremely impressed and would love to get more. PLEASE DISTRIBUTE TO CALIFORNIA!!!
M- Very smooth. Nice carbonation level. 
O- Excellent beer worthy of all the praise it recieves. I was kind of doubting that it could be as good as all the west coast ipa's that I love so much, but I shouldn't have. This is a great beer. 993 characterst420o, May 23, 2011
4.57/5  rDev +2.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Thanks again to Beerwolf77 and another homerun from Surly
A: Pours an amber gold color with a huge dense fluffy head. Excellent retention. Nice looking beer right here
S: Awesome nose consisting of mango, pineapple, fresh cut pine, resin, and a good dose of sugar. Seemingly balanced by caramel malts. Awesome
T: More resin than the nose suggested - usually not too big on the resin notes, but this works. Tropical fruit, pine, and balanced with caramel malts. Definitely bitter, but less so than Furious.
MF/O: Prickly carbonation kind of takes away from the feel and intensifies the bitterness, but balanced. Kind of a west coast Hopslam. I will definitely be seeking this out again 688 charactersscottyshades, May 22, 2011
3.04/5  rDev -31.8%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 2 | feel: 4 |  overall: 2Orange/amber body with a white head and some lacing.
Aroma is loaded with big fresh hops -- they jump out of the glass at you. Unfortunately, the taste is a disaster. There's big citrus/grapefruit hops, but then a nasty onion/vegetable taste. I tried to soldier on, but the onion taste just got to be too much.
Mouthfeel is fine.
After the awesome aroma, this had the makings of becoming one of my new favorites. Unfortunately, that massive onion taste just killed it. 471 charactersMavajo, May 21, 2011

Poured my Duvel Tulip.
Pours a nice glowing amber orange that is darker towards the top of the glass and gets closer to a bright yellow near the bottom. Very interesting. Leaves great lacing from it's 2" pearl white head.
Smells mostly of bittering hops but they allow the citrus and tangerine aromas peak through. 
Taste is of citrus, mango, pineapple, grapefruit, pine, grassy tones, and the hops finish it off. Seems like Simcoe, but don't take my word for it.
Mouthfeel is nice and light for a DIPA. Very well done on the carbonation and goes down very smooth.
Overall I am incredibly happy I finally got to try this. This was a great DIPA and well deserving of it's high ranking. Thanks again Kris. 777 charactersDearthVader, May 20, 2011
4.69/5  rDev +5.2%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Poured from a can into a Chimay goblet.
Appearance: Pours a cloudy reddish amber/golden color with a half finger of nearly white head. The head dissipates leaving just a thing ring around the edge of the glass.
Smell: Bitter citrus hops dominate. Actually smells quite fruity as well, but the hops really take over.
Taste: This beer has an awesome hop profile. Bitter hops hit the tongue first, but there is definitely enough malt sweetness to keep up. The citrus hop bitterness is joined by fruity hints of pineapple and tangerine. Bitter finish.
Mouthfeel: Medium body with delicate carbonation. The finish is dry and the beer sticks to your whole mouth.
Overall: This is an awesome Double IPA. One of my favorites. All the flavors work together perfectly, don't change a thing. 785 charactersoline73, May 20, 2011

4.56/5  rDev +2.2%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Beer for a glass, from a can. Poured about half into my Deschutes snifter. This one's got a 3/21/11 date. Thank you very much MooreHopps! Fitting since this is my first DIPA review.
Appearance - This one's a nice golden orange with some copper hues and it's fairly opaque. Lets call that chill haze as it clears up some with warming. Generous pour rate delivers about a finger and a half head that is more creamy than fizzy and settles rather quickly. Left with a nice ring around the glass, though. Couldn't resist smelling right away and the length of time it takes me to write about the appearance makes me really crave it.
Smell - This one is just one of the GREAT smelling DIPAs, rivaling some of my favorites. It's got some sweetness smell to it. The smell just makes me think of dank hops, citrusy/tropical fruit goodness, grapefruit, and some pine. Reminds me alot of Odell Myrcenary (which is really tropical fruit-like and floraly pungent). My mouth is watering, I don't know how I've waited this long to take a sip! Dear Surly, If you made an air freshener with exactly this smell, I'd buy a lifetime supply!!
Taste - Bam. This is among the standards for DIPAs in my opinion. I taste some sweetness as the smell suggested and it becomes citrus/tropical fruity in the taste with some floral and pine taste in there also, but it all mixes SO well. I'm also getting some smooth caramel malt and almost honey like notes. Reminds me a little of Hopslam (which is brewed with honey) and Myrcenary. Alcohol is well hidden, but I still can notice it a bit in the finish and feel some effects after only half a can. Finish goes off nicely with a citrusy/orange juice bitter or acidity note but it's good. OJ is my coffee in AM though. The flavors linger just long enough between sips to make you want more and more. Damn I can't wait for the next half of the can still in the fridge.
Mouthfeel - Very nice. Not quite crisp and not quite smooth, it's more a middle ground between the two. Carbonation seems perfect in this one, not too high or fizzy. Body is medium/balanced and just a treat to drink. Again, finish is average. Doesn't linger too long but stays with you long enough between extended savoring sips.
Overall - This is a fantastic brew. Really is. I can't say that it's my favorite DIPA, but it's in my top 5 for sure. I may have to rethink positions of my top 5 after this. I had a can from 2/28/11 last night that was decent, but not great. The month fresher one absolutely changed my mind about this beer. I can only imagine what it would be like a week or two after canning. Overall I'd say 4.5 out of 5. Which is what I'd give all of my top 5 DIPAs. Seek this beer out! 2,694 charactersmatttttYCE, May 16, 2011
4.51/5  rDev +1.1%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to benz08 for this one!
Popped the 16 ounce can and poured this honey-colored nectar with an orange glow into my DFH becker and raised an unimpressive head that sacrificed its structure to support its offspring...really nice lacing. The aroma that wafted up from the glass was awesome...it's as if I'm peeling a ripe, juicy red grapefruit. And the good news is that it pretty much transfers to the taste. The malts are hard to pick out underneath all the bitterness from the hops, but if you concentrate you cut through those 120ish IBUs and taste something like a honey bun. This has a classic mouthfeel for a DIPA which means a medium-plus body with enough IBUs to make the staunchest hop head happy. In fact, I've had few IPAs better than this one (one or two), but I've got a Pliny waiting in the wings which, if its reputation holds serve, all the IPAs on my favorite list will drop a rung. 903 charactersNaugros, May 15, 2011

A - Appearance is a nice orange hue and a head of about 1 finger. Color is thick enough that you cannot see through the other side of the glass.
S - Fresh citrus, pine, orange notes explode as a DIPA typically does.
T - Great taste that mirrored the smell. Very smooth with no harsh bitterness that I've experienced with some other DIPA's. So smooth you can't even notice the ABV.
M - Moderate mouthfeel, not as thick as a stout, but not as light as a pilsner. Very refreshing for a high ABV beer.
O - This beer is amazing, get some if you can. A great DIPA that I will go back to in a heart beat. My only wish is that I could get it locally. 753 charactersdavidbowers13, May 14, 2011

*I believe this was canned mid March.
Can to pint - I love it.
A: Whoa talk about heady topper! 3-4 fingers of tan head capped a dense and hazy orangish pale colored ale with some super sticky punch lacing going on.
S: Insane pineapple spike on the nose. Sweet danky herbs. So aromatic. Oh my! I think I just got a chub.
T: An absolute pineapple grenade. Fantastically delicious! Bitter peppery bite to it but not bracingly so at all. Quite well balanced actually. Malt profile is definitely a little different - more of a honey sweet and graham cracker note. But hops oh my! Cottonomouth affect on the finish. Sooo good.
M: More of a sticky sweetness on the palate with a very light creamy texture overall. Hops really pucker and dry out the mouth.
D: Too good! Sad to see this one go. So light and incredibly fruity. More please!
This brew reminds me alot of Pizza Port Carlsbad's - Poorman's IPA which is a great thing. Best beer in a can I have come across so far. Well worth hunting down and highly recommended to all lupulin lovers! 1,158 charactersNugganooch, May 13, 2011

4.51/5  rDev +1.1%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a can, this beer has a pale copper appearance with light haze throughout. The head barely reaches one-finger thickness before settling into a frothy film. The smell is an amazing blast of fresh pine hops, with little to no maltiness. Somewhat citrusy, this reminds me of the smell of Pliny The Elder more than any other DIPA I can think of. 
The taste is suprisingly more balanced than I expect from the smell. Orange and grapefruit hops forge across my tongue, matched by light, almost honey sweet malt. The bitterness at the back is literally tongue smacking good, and the alcohol is well hidden in the mix, though I can certainly feel the strength. I would have liked a bit more crispness in the mouthfeel, but overall the carbonation was adequate and it didn't get too syrupy considering the strength. 
Overall I'm pretty impressed by this beer. The hop aroma is top notch, and the maltiness isn't too sweet. That's just what I want in a double IPA and this delivers. Wish this was available year round like the Furious because I like it better. Highly recommended... 1,085 charactersbennetj17, May 13, 2011

S - Aroma is full of citrus hops with lots of grapefruit and tropical fruits. Also some floral hops in the background. Touch of malt in the background.
T - Starts off with lot of citrus hop flavor and bitterness. There is also some supporting light caramel malts around. Through the middle, some stronger bitterness and some piney hop flavor jumps out. Also some light apricot and other fruits. The finish is a mix of piney and citrus hop with a lot of bitterness that lingers really nicely.
M - Medium-full bodied with moderate carbonation. Really smooth and crisp and the bitterness is really quite strong and leaves a really nice dry feeling in the mouth.
D - Very drinkable. The hop profile here is really amazing. The flavors are really well balanced, especially the hop and malt balance here. This is a great beer. 1,004 charactersngeunit1, May 13, 2011
4.59/5  rDev +2.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Huge thanks to urbancaver for hooking me with this beer!!!
There's just something about cracking open a can of beer and not having it be some fizzy yellow waste of space....
Massive citrusy, tropically fruity, floral aromas dominate the aroma. Clean malt isn't standing in the way. 
Hazy light orange in color with a thin off-white head that's holding up well. 
Fruity and floral hops push forward on the palette with specific notes of mandarin orange and pine. Bitterness is intense and lingering on into a medium dry finish. 
Medium in body with a slight resiny thickness present. Carbonation is also moderate and appropriate for the style. Intensely hoppy without being astringent. 
This one's approaching perfection though just shy of a 5.0. None the less, packing the hoppy punch and variety of flavor that makes for an exceptionally enjoyable double IPA. 866 charactersBrewerB, May 12, 2011
4.62/5  rDev +3.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I teach college writing. Between my academic work, personal commitments, and teaching, this past semester was the busiest time of my whole entire life. Because it was so busy, I had to break some of my personal rules. Rule 1: When grading, if you come across a paper that is especially good or horribly bad, wait a while before grading the next one. 
It makes sense. Grading papers, like reviewing beers, is essentially subjective; we just try out best to normalize it by cramming our subjective feelings into the criteria listed on a rubric. And it would be unfair to let the especial goodness or badness of the preceding reviewee influence our take on the ones that follow it. 
But, damnit, I'm tired of pretending to be objective. Sometimes you feel let down, and you seek out something that will alleviate that feeling. Doesn't that something deserve credit for doing (or not doing) that job? If I can't properly judge a beer after judging another, excellent or horrible one, then what's to say I can't judge a beer if I'm in a bad mood, or if I'm tired, or especially happy?
What I'm getting at is that normally, after trying and failing to slog through Millstream's abysmal Hop 2, I'd have just gone to bed, or switched to something old and reliable. But tonight, my heartache from Millstream's failure was so intense that I couldn't just let it pass by. I had to erase it. Violently. It needed to be scrubbed away, and we all know that the best scrubbing surfaces are the most abrasive ones.
This is a beer that tears thousands of little holes into everything you hate. It's like a brillo pad for your mind. 
Good double IPAs usually feature some intense complexity of hops, or some intricate interplay of the hops and yeast. Normally I prefer the latter variety, but this is the most excellent example I've ever seen of the former. 1,844 charactersmynie, May 12, 2011
4.5/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Fairly bright medium amber color with modest head and lacing. 
Pronounced and inviting aroma of grapefruit and pine. And the taste delivers plenty of the same. Copious hops on a sweetish malt base. Modest bitterness, or at least that is the appearance. I suspect the melding of the hops and malt is hiding a lot of the bitterness behind the malt. Although there is plenty of sweetness in the middle, the finish is dry and gives the impression of a balanced brew.
Big juicy body with well hidden alcohol. Liquid hops candy! Another great beer that lives up to its reputation - I guess the Beer Advocates know what they are talking about. 638 charactersCliffBrake, May 10, 2011

I was amazed that they had this beer on tap. Have had it several times from the can, was excited to have it this way.
A - poured a nice 1 inch head that laced from start to finish. Nice yellow color with an orange hue. Very eye appealing. On sight alone, makes me want to have this beer.
S - nice citrus aroma of orange and grapefruit with just a little bit of pine aroma on the end. The fruit is the most prevelant aroma present.
T - first taste is of the nice hop explosion, then followed by the orange citrus. The malt is present on the back of the pallet adding sweetness to the citrus. This beer tastes amaizing.
M - stays in mouth and is very pleasant to the mouth. The mouthfeel lends it to still being a very easy to drink beer.
O - Amazing beer, great taste of hops, citrus, and malt that all work real well together. Can defitely feel the ABV, but well worth it. Would recommend this beer to anyone. 982 charactersbiglobo8971, May 07, 2011

T: An all out hop attack. Very nice hop bitterness and grapefruit notes. A little malt comes through at the end, but mostly just bitter, fruity hops. A great example of what a DIPA
should taste like.
M: Medium body that is almost oily. Perfect carbonation. Dry finish.
O: A fantastic beer. One of the best examples of a DIPA I have had. A little too heavy to have a lot of but still drinkable. 558 charactersjimixr, May 05, 2011

can dated 3/21/11
A: Robust, thick looking hazy amber pour, head forms super slow. Suggestion of low carbonation. 
S: Sharp citric and pine notes over sugar coated malt. Dank and resinous, lots of pineapple & tangerines. 
T: Blast of citric hops, matching levels of bitterness. Tangerine, grapefruit, pineapple. 9% is overshadowed by an immense amount of flavor. Fruit forward, sweet malt merely provides a base. Taste is pretty much world class in my opinion, and my sample is over a month old.
M: Thick, chewy which is nice. Though I thought carbonation was slightly low.
O: Now one of my favorite DIPAs. 628 characterszoolzoo, May 04, 2011
4.92/5  rDev +10.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Thanks to brother Nick for hooking me up with two cans of this sought-after ale!
Pours from the can a peachy sunset orange color, with a creamy if not super-huge head that stands firm and lasts a long while.
The aroma is out of this world. Total hop overload, in a good way, but also with enough malt backing it up where it starts to take on a welcoming candy-like vibe. Smells I can't properly describe emanate from Abrasive, but they're somewhat of a juxtaposition between the poles of peppermint, spearmint, spruce, mango, pineapple, ginger, toffee and honey. My oh my.
The taste (and somehow "taste" seems an egregious understatement) is a similarly sensuous compilation of the aromas described, although with a more strongly herbal component, much like the sticky marijuana bud appeal of Oskar Blues' Gubna (a beer I proudly defend) but certainly less abrasive than Gubna, ironically enough. Exotic and tropical fruit meets mutant pine in a taffy factory. And wow, is that texture perfect for what's happening on the tongue. Slightly sticky, a bit chewy, very creamy, but never overwhelming or too thick.
Holy shit, this is a total out-of-the-park offering from Surly. One of the best beers I have ever had. And I have nothing more to say, because it's time to kick back and simply enjoy this lovely, lovely beer... 1,324 charactersMetalmonk, May 03, 2011

4.22/5  rDev -5.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Did an impromptu IP trade with one of Biglobo's crew at DLD, wish i remembered his name, and then split the can with another guy standing near us, wish i remembered his name too.
The color of this is as tangerine orange as i've seen. deep inticing hue that makes you salivate with anticipation. 
The aroma and flavors just loft and scream floral esters and grapefruit. The more subtle flavors hide some tropical notes and some faint wet cut grass notes along with the previously mentioned esters. Dispite being canned about a month ago it was action packed, if it was loftier before it would be wild. 
Super good. I'd buy it anytime, if i was Mn.
I still have 1 more can to drink and update if needed too, which is exciting. 726 charactersChadQuest, May 02, 2011

A- this one pours out a translucent light amber colored body with a rather large bright white head on top. the head lasts for a while and leaves behind small rings of lacing. very nice. 
S- the main attraction in the nose is the hops. the initial whiff brings forth lots of resiny pine and grapefruit. there are some lighter pineapple and orange zest notes as well. at the end there are some sweet caramel malts which try to add some balance here.
T- the first sip starts off with lots of sweet caramel malts that add a solid malt backbone to this. after that its all about the hops. plenty of grapefruit and pine. there are also orange zest and pineapple notes. nice and bitter. 
M- the body is on the larger side of medium. the carbonation is spot on. nice and bitter. leaves my mouth feeling dry. it tastes like theres less than 9% ABV in here. 
O- i really liked this one. the can seems fresher than my first pour of this back when it was called 16 grit. ill be looking to get more of this the next time its released. very solid DIPA in a can. 1,193 charactersjwinship83, May 02, 2011

T- Pine, citrus, and a slight malt finish.
D- Bitter at first sip, but balances quickly. Nice carbonation and very drinkable.

A- Darker Golden to straw color. A bit darker than PtE. A bit hazy. A great head, with little retention.
S- Citrus explosion, I love the citra. Super floral. Grapefruit sweetened by a good malt backbone.
T- More citrus, more bitter than PtE. Really floral and Grapefruity.
M- Good mouthfeel. A good long finish that lingers.
Overall- I think I'm partial to Abrasive over PtE. Could be the lifecycles that each is in. EIther way, I love them both. 526 charactersGrandCruDrew, Apr 30, 2011
4.77/5  rDev +7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5A - Pours a dark copper color with a nice one fingered thick, creamy white head, no carbonation. After the creamy foam dies down there's a white ring left sticking to the glass, swirl it, and the foam continues to stick like glue.
S - Giddyup! This beer WREAKS of pungent tropical fruit that's so ripe, it's ready to fall off the vine. Pineapple, mango's, grapefruit, papaya, juicy orange, the aroma is absolutely obscene. There's some bready malt in there as well but the fruit completely dominates the nose. Acidic fruit also comes to mind.
T - It's all about the fruit in this beer, it does an absolutely fantastic job of showcasing a perfect blend of hops and malt. From start to finish the hops keep coming at you. Things start out with a quick punch of tart fruit at the tip of the tongue, then quickly moves to rich pineapple and mango, keeps rolling along into a red grapefruity/piney finish. There's a slight bit of warming he way down from the alcohol, but not much at all. 
M - Heavy medium body, rich, full and leaves a tingling on the tongue as it glides across. Lip smacking tasty! The grapefruit rind lingers in the mouth for several minutes
O - This is a world class, big IPA. Rich, juicy, and decadent. Abrasive can easily hold it's own against two of my other favorite big West Coast IPA's! Excellent job, Surly! Bravo!! 1,342 charactersjzeilinger, Apr 29, 2011

This beer seemed to survive much better than a comparable bottled DIPA. I'll raise a can to that.
A - dark reddish orange with a perfect 1.5 finger off white head. Very bubbly and foamy.
S - Tons of citrus fruit, specifically orange and grapefruit. If I had to guess I would say this was dry hopped with Simcoe.
T - Almost like a sweet orange juice up front and finishes decidedly bitter and piny. Bitter flavors linger for some time. I can see how this is abrasive to some, but very good to me. Since this was an older can, I can certainly pick up some diacetyl flavors. The 9% ABV is very well masked.
M - Thick and creamy with moderate carbonation. Finishes a bit harsh, but is mostly smooth all the way through.
O - A great DIPA. I'm going to try to find a fresh can for a new review. 884 charactersdmsohyea, Apr 29, 2011

A- Poured from a 16oz. can into a pint glass. Nice cloudy orange honey color. One finger creamy head disappears rather quickly, but leaves a nice sticky lacing around the glass. 
S- Fresh citrus, pineapple, mango, slight hoppiness matched well with sweet caramel malts. I wish it would pop into my nose a bit more, but maybe a pint wasnt the best choice for this one. Shoulda grabbed my tulip!
T- Fresh fruit right up front! Orange zest, mango, lemon... the malt and hops come in at the same time... perfect blend. Finishes with nice grapefruit/honey aftertaste! Just a touch of alcohol... not at all overwhelming. Delicious!!!
M- Again... the bitterness and sweetness blend seamlessly! Honey and pine... fresh citrus!!! Makes your mouth feel clean!
D- If I could get this where I am in Cali... This would be my go to hop satisfier. Really nice balance. 950 charactersSoCalStout, Apr 29, 2011

S: citrus, citrus, citrus, plus some piney notes, with a carmel malt base - Sierra Nevada Pale Ale on a mega dose of steroids.
T: Malt base, with a hop rush, and a tiny bit of an alcohol finish. Superb.
M: Nice mouth feel, but lacks some of the oiliness of IPA's/DIPA's that I enjoy. I like the oiliness.
O: A neutron bomb of a DIPA that is very drinkable. I could sip on this all night and into the morning. Slaps Furious aside as my favorite Surly beverage. 566 charactersovaltine, Apr 29, 2011
4.84/5  rDev +8.5%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5An absolutely insane extra from G133 in our recent trade. I had no idea this was going to be that good. You should have warned me. 
From a 500ml can into a snifter. 
APPEARANCE: Pours syrupy looking out of the can. Awesome. Pour yields a one finger, medium-thinner looking, off-white head with decent retention. Loose and airy head unfortunately. Head fades to a splotchy wisp and ring. Deep burnt orange in color, but more of an SAE amber when held to the light, perfectly clear with zero carbonation evident. Dots of wisp and a ring remain leaving dots of lace down the glass. 
SMELL: Awesome! Huge nose on this one. Pale malts, caramel, and piles of pine and citrus notes. Lemon, mango and grapefruit aromas in there as well. A piney, citrusy hop bomb of a nose, and it’s bold as hell. Love this. 
TASTE: And I thought the nose was killer. This is exactly how a DIPA should taste. Lots of pale malts, caramel malt, and mango sweetness, then piles of piney, bitter hops at the swallow. Citrus, lemon, sweet mango, and bitter pine and grapefruit come out wonderfully at the finish. A bitter-sweet aftertaste of citrusy sweetness and hoppy, piney bitterness lingers and lingers, with a touch of alcohol to boot. This is the ultimate in balanced double IPAs. It’s a hop bomb with the malt backbone to support it. Just stunning. 
PALATE: Medium-full body with medium carbonation. Creamy enough on the palate, goes down smooth and finishes slightly dry on the palate. Pretty heavy too for the style, but it works great with the heavy malt backbone. Could be slightly creamier, but love the fullness and weight on this one. 
OVERALL: Just awesome. This is the DIPA of DIPAs. Blows Pliny and Hopslam out of the water, and deserves every ounce of praise that it gets. I can see, just based on this can and Darkness, why MN folk lover their Surly. This is one I’ll definitely have to try to track down again. Thanks again G133 for making this part of our trade. Someone trade me more of this stuff please. Always ISO a 4 pack of this holly nectar. Highly recommended! 2,072 charactersJeffo, Apr 28, 2011
4.94/5  rDev +10.8%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A - It pours a small off-white head into a tulip glass. Very minimal lacing, and the head dies down quickly. The beer is clear with a beautiful medium golden-orange hue.
S - I could smell this beer from 3 feet away. It packs a huge punch of tropical fruit, and citrus with a mellow complementing caramel malt presence. It reminds me a bit of red fruit punch.
M - Medium in body, with moderate carbonation. Its pretty dry and has a slick feel from the hops oils.
T - The taste is full of tropical fruit. Citrus, orange, tangerine and a multitude of other trace amounts of fruitiness. It finishes with a grapefruit rind bitterness that lingers long after swallowing. The alcohol is non-existent in the taste, kudos to Surly on that.
A tropical fruit hop bomb with an unforgiving bitterness. This is as good as they come, when it comes to Imperial IPAs. I highly recommend getting your hands on this beer, although you may have to wait until next year's release at this point. 977 charactersboralyl, Apr 26, 2011

Poured into a New Holland pint glass. You can smell the hops when you pop the can. Holy Cow!
Pours a slightly hazy, deep golden color with an offwhite head of about 2 fingers. Head is slow to drop, but stands up with about a finger's worth of foam. Nice lacing too.
Aromas of mind numbing piny and citrus hops, grapefruit, orange. Some malt in the background, but this is all about the hops.
Named appropriately. Tongue scraping bitterness, huge pine and citrus hop bomb. Grapefruit and orange. Some caramel maltiness. Finish goes on forever, with bitter grapefruit never really fading away. No alcohol noticeable.
Mouthfeel is almost puckering bitterness, can feel a slight tug at the back of the teeth as my cheeks try to cave in. For such a high bitterness, it isn't astringent at all. Some warming alcohol towards the middle of the glass.
Overall an amazing beer. Bitter as all hell. But no grassiness that you sometimes get from overhopping. Very nice. 1,037 charactersJamnesCameron, Apr 24, 2011

A- 16oz. can into a Bruery snifter. Pours a hazy golden straw color with a nice 2 finger off white head. Fantastic lacing.
S- Nothing but hops, both citrus and floral. What an amazing smell. Grapefruit, orange, and a sugary sweetness also come through. Well done.
T- Delicious hops up front hit with the bitterness I come to expect from a world class DIPA. Fruits and floral notes all at once with a malty sweetness coming through towards the end. Perfectly executed, with not a trace of alcohol.
M- Clean, crisp, and refreshing, with no lingering bitterness at all. A fantastic example of the style, and easily my favorite.
O- The high praise for this beer going in made me skeptical, and this being my first Surly brew made it even worse. Not only did it impress me beyond words, it easily hangs with Pliny the Elder in terms of overall complexity. My first taste of  Surly will definitely not be my last. 1,002 charactersJoshVandy, Apr 22, 2011

Pours a nice fluffy 1 finger head that fades at a medium pace with a bit of lacing over slightly hazy orange nectar colored beer.
Nose is wafting out awesomeness, pure hops, tons of citrus and tropical fruits, tangerine, light orange, bit of grapefruit, almost peach like, a light sweet toasty malt underneath it, some nice piny aromas as well, some sweet almost malty sugar base, nice balance.
Taste brings wondrous hops again, loaded with fruits, tropical fruits, nectarine, tangerine, light grapefruit, orange, citrus, some pine, fairly bitter but not crazy bitter. A decent malt base supports all the great hops, nice fairly sweet malts, a bit gritty as well. Finishes a bit more bitter as the bitterness ramps up a bit, fairly dry finish to juxtapose the sweet initial taste, tons of lingering citrus, tropical fruit, some pine, lots of nice hops. Booze is hidden pretty well, just a touch of a warming.
Mouth is medium bodied, a bit "abrasive" feeling, with decent carbonation.
Overall great beer, delicious hops, pine, tropical fruits, citrus, great nose, nice malty balance, fairly sweet to start and drier finish, booze is hidden well. 1,268 charactersjlindros, Apr 22, 2011

Thank you to an outstanding trade with Evanlarkin for this can!
Appearance:
Classy label, as stated before I love the use of cans for fine beers. Pouring the beer reveals deep, rich orange colored IPA with a generously foamy head. The head whittled down to a thin halo around the outskirts of my tulip, but I'm not complaining. I also noticed some sediment that poured into my glass towards the end of the can... the more yeast the better (in my opinion)!
Smell:
Mouthwatering aromatics. I love when an IPA just absorbs you into it and answers your night's prayers for a delicious beer... before you're even taken the first sip. Yeah, that's what this beer does with its strong notes of citrus grapefruit, alcohol and sugary sweetness. 
Taste:
Hoppy and sweet, a delightful balance that doesn't coat my palate for hours after each sip. The liquor-grade %abv adds to the beer's bite, but is still overshadowed by the beer's hoppy bitterness. Classic IPA, smooth and relaxing beverage with a good balance between aromatics and bittering.
Mouthfeel:
This beer is tremendous, almost no lingering bitter aftertastes which is generally my breaking point for a beer being better than just "good." Instead there is a clean, smooth IPA that entails. The grapefruit is carried through the beer's flavor profile better than expected giving additional bursts of tropical bitterness and sourness (not in an infected batch way). Delightful.
Overall:
This is the point where price comes into play, which this beer is exceptionally CHEAP! I have absolutely thrilled that this beer was thrown in as a trading add-bonus for a completely different beer from a completely different brewery. I thank you Evan for my Surly introduction and would love to see more beers as pleasant as this for the price as competative!!
Cheers. 1,833 charactersThePorterSorter, Apr 20, 2011

A: It has a paler orange color than Furious, and less carbonation. Head leaves no lacing but a decent bone-white head of foam. 
S: This is where it starts to gets crazy. Citrus heavy and floral notes. A hint of caramel. So sooo thick of an aroma you cant help but be overwhelmed. Someone run me a hop bath!
T: Grapefruit, grapefruit, grapefruit. A sweetness that enforces the citrusy hop bitter, but absolutely nose to rear this abrasive ale is chock-full of hops. A slight boozy character in the middle. 
M: And the crazyness lingers...puckering, literally. Hangs in the pockets and coats the enamel as only quality lupulin should. My mouth is wearing a green dinner jacket and I like it. 
O: Because of the Pint size can, I probably wont ask for seconds, buts it enough to keep you thoughtful and mindful of what good hoppage is. 900 charactersBasementBer, Apr 20, 2011

16 oz. CAN poured gently into a Russian River flute glass. Huge fluffy/soapy offwhite, slightly beige head. Sticks all over the glass; excellent head retention. As I move in for a whiff, I am immediately smacked in the face with passion fruit and a pine tree. Incredible aroma. I could smell this all day; do they sell this in air-freshener form? Flavor is more passionfruit / grapefruit, pine, apricots, and sweet caramel malts. Floral/fruity hops lingering in the finish. Well carbonated, prickly on the tongue with a slightly sweet/sticky finish. Probably one of the best DIPAs I have ever tried. 650 charactersmuttyd, Apr 17, 2011
4.85/5  rDev +8.7%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Deep amber and orange colors - thick, foamy, glorious off-white head. The head just keeps sticking around, then sticks to the side of the glass all the way down for serious globs of beautiful lacing.
Nose is rich and full. I wasn't even near the glass after pouring and I could smell grapefruit and grassy, piny hops. On closer inspection bits of lemon and orange zest come out. A little bit of vanilla, some peach and mango. Simply put, the nose is a combination of tropical and arctic forests. Great joy.
Wow. Taste takes the big nose and kicks it up to 11. The pine hops are the spotlight long after the swallow. Upfront, most of the flavor is sweet fruits and vanilla, occasional wash of caramel. The hops profile is quite exceptional, citrus and floral keep dancing together in the aftertaste, occasionally they show up in between hits of the sweetness, but really don't make themselves known until the end.
The mouthfeel is a little heavier than medium, just about right for the style in my opinion. Though it is quite syrupy, each sip ends crisply. It can be a little boozy, but drank appropriately, this is a true pleasure. This is quite a satisfying beer. You won't be disappointed! 1,194 charactersdogger6253, Apr 17, 2011

A - pours a very rich honey light burnt sienna with a decent creamy head that leaves fairly thin lacing.
S - wonderful! Just huge notes of tropical citrus, grapefruit, oranges and tangerines. Smells like a fresh mix of hops grapefruit and orange peel.
T - sugar soaked tropical fruits mixed with an extreme amount of hops with enough malts to back up what's going on here. Extremely drinkable and a fantastic DIPA.
M - very good but just a tad light bodied. Very sticky, dry, mouth-coating finish that leaves you constantly wanting another sip.

A - Appears a nice slightly hazy orange color with some nice golden hints. There is a nice slight ecru head that is about 1 inch tall and recedes at a medium pace. Gorgeous.
S - Tropical mango notes are present as well as some delicious pine notes. Citrus grapefruit, tangerine and orange as well as some nice dank notes. A pot heads dream?? haha Nice malt caramel sweetness is surprisingly well balanced for such a hoppy beer. Grassy and slight flowery bouquet notes.
T & M - Wow! This is the real deal. Starts off with some slight sweet mango notes, some papaya and some nice tangerine notes. There is also some awesome hop juiciness. Dank pine is also present and has some slight sticky resin to it. Nice balanced grapefruit notes. There is awesome bread notes as well with some grain and earthy toasty malt notes. Hidden nicely in the middle. The hop profile is delicious and intense but its so well balanced and delicious. Very approachable beer for the style. I'm floored by this beer and would love to have it fresher. Still this is amazing. Good crispness and some nice lighter carbonation with a light-medium mouthfeel and a good dry bitter finish.
O - Well deserved praise for the Abrasive Ale. Well crafted and very intense yet approachable. 1,339 charactersJoEBoBpr, Apr 15, 2011

Appearance: Rich, slightly cloudy, and deep amber orange. Decent sized two finger white head that slowly fades into a white patch. Decent lacing. 
Smell: Huge burst of citrus hops. Grapefruit dominates with pine resin, pale malts and caramel malts in the background. Smells very full flavored and tropical. The strongest fruit esters I've smelled in a beer. 
Taste: Strong grapefruit hop flavor followed by some pine resin and some caramel and toffee malts forming a solid background. Starts very bitter and ends fairly fruity and sweet from the malts. Tastes great. 
Mouthfeel: Full bodied with a moderate level of carbonation. Rich, chewy, and creamy with a drying finish. Alcohol heat is hidden by the massive feel of hops. 
Overall: An incredible DIPA. Packed to the brim with citrus grapefruit flavor. 851 charactersMattyG85, Apr 10, 2011

A: Pours a beautiful slightly hazy golden orange with an off-white head. Some lacing left around glass as this delicious beer is consumed.
S: BIG mango and grapefruit hop aroma with a touch of tangerine, strong enough to smell when the glass is a foot away, incredible!
T: Huge fruity taste, the sweet hop resins bombard my tastebuds with tropical fruit and a touch of caramel. Balance is a bit on the sweet side for an IIPA but the incredible hop flavors mingle with the sweet malts so well there is very little to complain about.
M: Super sweet and juicy mouthfeel, like I am chewing on a piece of tropical fruit hop flavored gum. None of the sharpness that is typical with many beers of this style.
O: Easily one of the best IIPAs out there, delicious and refreshing from start to finish, wonderfully crafted beer from surly, cheers to you! 939 charactersAzurescens, Apr 09, 2011

4.94/5  rDev +10.8%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Pours a hazy sunset orange with a 1.5 finger head that hangs around a little bit.
Smell is amazing. I poured it in my BP Anni. Tulip and put it on the table and I could smell it from 3 feet away. Amazing tropical/grapefruit aromas along with some piney, resinous undertones. Delicious.
Taste follows the smell, thank god, I definately didnt want to be let down after the aromas I was getting. Tropical fruits up front along with a little sweetness, the some piney hops, followed by a little caramel malt and finishes with some bitterness. Perfect.
Mouthfeel is nice and creamy, not too thick. Perfect carbonation and a little dry on the finish.
Wow, This is right up there with PTE, maybe better. Definately one of the best Imperial IPA's Ive ever had, not to bitter and the 10% is very well hidden, I could drink this all day long and then some. If you love IPA's, you have to have this. 892 charactersPaulydeets, Apr 09, 2011
4.55/5  rDev +2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5A big thanks to ncmussell for this beer I have been wanting to try for quite some time. Cheers!
Appearance - Pours a darker orange, tangerine hue into my SA Perfect Pint. About a finger of white head is achieved with a moderate pout. This dissipates somewhat fast, leaving just a hint of lacing around the edges of the glass.
Smell - Damn, when I opened the can I was immediately greeted with some amazing aromas. Once I poured it into the glass and allowed it to warm for a bit, the smells became that much more intoxicating. Lots of citrus such as mango and pineapple. A great hop aroma mixed with pine, and a nice malty, caramel smelling backbone.
Taste - Hot damn I've been waiting for this for a while. While the taste is sweet up front, I feel it is more from the citrus than malt (though the malty backbone does become prevalent later on in the taste). The hops come in during the middle, mixed with the pine, and the flavor ends with a caramel taste, and then a hint of bitterness. So many flavors and characteristics during the sip. Amazing.
Mouthfeel - Nice and thick, creamy, oily resin. Decent carbonation, finishes a hint dry and bitter.
Overall - Who has 3 more 16oz cans of this in his refrigerator? THIS GUY. Very happy I was finally able to try this and will for sure trade for it in the future. A fantastic DIPA and extremely easy to quaff. No alcohol taste or warming. It goes down like nothing. Abrasive has lived up to the hype in my opinion. 1,468 charactersSpdKilz, Apr 07, 2011
4.3/5  rDev -3.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Can. I remember having 16 Grit from a growler before but unfortunately I didn't rate it so this will have to do. Canned on 3/09/11 and sampled on 4/6/11. Poured into a DFH tulip glass a darker, slightly haze, honey apricot color with a nice, full, sticky light tan head that coats the glass with lace as it settles. Pungent, musky aroma of hops in the nose of the citrus variety; with mainly orange and grapefruit undertones. Medium/heavy mouthfeel. At first sip I was wondering where the hop bitterness was but then BAM! it hits you towards the middle/end like a freight train. Well balanced though with a sweet malty feel in the beginning. Bitterness lingers on but not in an unpleasant way. Does it really get better than this? 730 characterskbutler1, Apr 06, 2011
4.54/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.51 pint can poured into a New Belgium Goblet
Appearance: Hazy orangish color. Fairly thin white head. Maybe just a little lacing.
Aroma: Piney with lots of citrus. Almost smells like a cocktail. (In a good sense.) To me, it's the perfect DIPA smell.
Taste: Sweet, citrusy, with a long finish. The finish is bitter, yet sweet. It's really good, but hard to explain. (Or I just suck at explaining it.)
Mouthfeel: While the odd bitter finish lasts, the feel of the beer is quickly gone. It's not syrupy, just smooth with a good amount of carbonation. 
Overall: One of my favorite beers. Citrusy Sweet with some great hoppy/bitter notes. Easy to drink, hard to find. 666 characterscmannes, Apr 06, 2011
4.54/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to seeswo for this pint can, poured into an imperial pint glass. Canned on date of 1/24/11.
A- Hazy golden orange. Moderate pour produced a finger worth of white frothy head. Head dissipated into a fine lacing cover. Moderate amount of glass lacing.
S- I could smell the piney goodness as soon as I opened the can. Mango, pineapple and hints of grapefruit are also dominating the nose. It is a citrus bomb. If there is malt, it has entered witness protection with citrus as its body guards.
T- The citrus is still present in the taste but is toned down. Mainly ruby red grapefruit with lemon and mango. The malt acts like a spoonful of sugar to add the right amount of sweetness. Long and persistent bitter linger. 
M- Medium body with correct amount of carbonation. Not exactly crisp, but almost. It is really sticky.
O- Another winner from Surly. The smell won be over at first sniff. The taste is there, just not as great as the smell, which would be near impossible. Not sure I would want more than one drink at a time. The abv is just high enough that two would make be good and tipsy and I wouldn't appreciate the second as much as I should. 1,159 charactersbetsona, Apr 05, 2011
4.34/5  rDev -2.7%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5First time trying Abrasive, thanks Tewaris. 
Canned on 2/7/11. Poured into a Tyler's/Speakeasy pint glass. 
Pours a burnt orange color, light and slightly cloudy. No head, just a white top layer that dissipates within a few seconds. 
Aroma is a ton of citrus, grapefruit and sweet acidic fumes. Smells fantastic. 
Taste is very nice, hops up front, dry, floral and citrus notes as expected. Maltier finish than I was expecting, and not all that bitter. The finish is not what I was expecting, it's very unique and somewhat sweet. There is an umami type flavor in here that I can't place. Lots of malt. 
Mouthfeel is nice, I would like a bit more carbonation, the finish is abrupt which is surprising for a beer with so much hops. 
The aroma of this beer was the best part. The taste was good, but the smell was the tops for any DIPA I've tasted. I would love to try it on tap some time. 892 charactersIpatsfans, Apr 05, 2011
4.45/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5another Surly brew review thanks to one of the best trades ever from FreshmanPour77. I cannot wait to try this DIPA. 
A- pours a hazy orange body that literally glows in my ithaca tulip. A nice head of foam with a yellow tint sticks around with some decent traces of lacing on the sides.
S- I have smelled this before! Massive hops with pineapple, mango, and citrus flavors up front. Piney resin at the back. The alcohol does not pop up at all. As another reviewer wrote... this does smell like Flower Power! Spicey and herbal as well. Very uplifting!
T- pure citrus with a blends of caramel malt show up. Very, very, very bitter with the flavors clinging all over the palate. It's a hop fest that makes sure some malty flavors are around. The connection to pineapples is impeccable in the brew and the bitterness is a great ending
M- syrupy carbonated flavor all over the mouth. I love it!
D- I cannot say enough about Surly's brews. Abrasive ale is spot on with the other brews. This is incredibly tasty with the alcohol almost distant. This is one highly recommended DIPA. IF SURLY EVER CAME TO SYRACUSE, I WOULD LOSE MY MIND!!!! 1,137 characterslovindahops, Apr 03, 2011

A: Poured cloudy golden orange with one and half finger head than dissipated rather quickly into a thin creamy lacing, decent carbonation.
S: Pine , Citrus , Hops , slight malt
Taste : Hops upfront, grapefruit ,pine and decent malt backing.
O: Overall this was a treat of an Ipa, The fruity flavors were well balanced with pine and hop notes as well as a decent malt backing that evened this abrasive beast out. I will be seeking out more in the future. 566 charactersInebriatedJoker, Apr 02, 2011
4.12/5  rDev -7.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 41/24/11 canning date, drank from a tuilip. The beer poured a clear golden amber with about a finger of white fluffy head. The aroma was fruity - pineapple, grapefruit, with some sticky pineyness. The taste was pungently hoppy. It was very sweet and malty up front, then settling in to a bitterly hopped up finnish. The mouthfeel was smooth and pleasantly syrupy, well carbonated with a dry finish. Overall this was a well balanced and tasty DIPA. 446 characterssurlytheduff, Apr 02, 2011
4.42/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.516 oz can poured into tulip shaped imperial pint glass.
The beer pours a dark golden yellow, very similar to the color of Mott's apple juice. The head is very large and white, but dissipates very quickly leaving a sparkling, glittery lace all over the glass.
The smell is strong pine and grapefruit...almost an even balance between the two. Most IPAs seem to lean one way, but this one has a definite balance on the hop nose. I also pick up a very nice dank wet hop smell here. There is a little bit of a sweet pastry note in the background that adds a little doughy sweetness that keeps it from being too bitter.
The taste is bitter sweet on the front with strong notes of pineapple and citrus fruit. This is followed by a fantastic peach/nectarine flavor that is outstanding...really adds a nice delicate balance to an otherwise powerful flavor. This is definitely one of the fruitiest IPAs I've tasted. There is a little bit of a dry grassiness at the finish, but the main flavor here is sweet fruity hops and there is no shortage.
The mouth is carbonated well but finishes a little oily. This is one of the few dings on a remarkable interpretation of the DIPA style. The drinkability is decent and comparable to many of the other big boy DIPAs.
Overall, a nice offering from Surly. I prefer some of their other beers (I'm looking at you, Bender), but this is definitely something I could drink a few of if it were readily available. When fresh, one of the better IPAs out there...really love this one compared to the other Midwest big-names (Hopslam, Double Trouble, etc). 1,581 charactersdgfair, Apr 02, 2011
4.54/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Pint can (thank you mnbearsfan!) into a Duvel Snifter. 
Pours cloudy orange/amber with a smallish, white head which dissipated into a coating or less. There is some light lacing all the way through. Nose is grapefruit, pineapple, lemon zest and mango, with pine and floral notes. As others have said, the nose of this beer never quits. The taste is grapefruit, some sweet caramel malt, brown sugar and honey . The finish is dry and mildly bitter, but refreshingly so. Warning, wow, there is no sense of the ABV on the way down. Mouthfeel is medium to light with a wonderful crispness, medium carbonation, and only slightly sticky. For those who still think great things can't come in a can, I offer this as definitive evidence. All-in-all, this is a great DIPA and one i would love to have regular access to. 808 charactersregspeir, Apr 01, 2011
4.82/5  rDev +8.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Received in a trade thanks syrupjoe! Really excited to try this one out! Can dateed 1/14/2011.
Appearance: Poured into my DFH Signature Glass with a half finger white head on top of a dark orange opaque body.
Smell: Very hoppy as expected. So much citrus it is rediculous. This reminds me of another beer but I cant place my finger on it right now. Maybe reminiscent of Ithaca Flower Power (which is a great thing).
Taste: Wow this beer is amazing. I would not change a thing about the taste. Super citrusy and fruity. Not too high on the bitterness for the stated IBUs but the bitterness is there. This beer is very sweet and almost like a hop juice which is perfect for a hophead such as myself.
Mouthfeel: Nice bubbly feeling with the carbonation which really helps enhance the taste. Nice medium thickness.
Overall: Give me more! I wish Surly was availble by me. If I am ever in Minnesota at the right time I will stock up on this! I thought Furious was great but Abrasive blows it out of the water. 1,008 charactersOddNotion, Mar 31, 2011
4.32/5  rDev -3.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4.5Can poured into my New Belgium globe. Thank you spycow for this much wanted brew.
Wow as a I pour this all I can say is it smells phenomenal. I can't wait to drink this one. Orange-hazy body with a big white head that sticks to the side of the glass. Smells incredible. Citrusy hop notes mingle with some tropical hints and a mango like sweetness. Really this is how a DIPA should smell. The taste brings a more balanced attack than the nose, nice citrusy notes up front balanced with a pale malt base. Fairly bitter in the finish but not too much so. Really nice hop flavor without being overly bitter. mouthfeel is medium body with a little less carbonation than I'd like.
Overall this is a fantastic beer. I love the aroma on this one and the flavor makes it a top notch DIPA. I hope I can try this on draft someday since I've come to realize that is how most DIPA's truly shine. That being said I would never be upset to get more of this. A fantastic beer that I think I will seek out when it is re released next year. 1,024 charactersjpmclaug, Mar 30, 2011
4.57/5  rDev +2.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Big thanks to KeefD for sending me a 4-pack of this along with other locals in our recent trade - I've been wanting to have this for a long time.
Pours a lighter orange/yellow with a touch of brown. Has slight clarity but is more translucent and appears a bit cloudy. Head is as usual for Surly - large, caky, fluffy and very fine. Off-white beast leaves spotty lacing and retains for a long time as a half-finger cap.
The smell is intoxicating as soon as you hear the hiss of the can - it's that strong. To my nose, this is the most citrus-centric beer I've smelled in a while. Tons of grapefruit and clean orange, with just a hint of pineapple, this beer is more fragrant than many air fresheners on the market. A bit of pine and malt at the back offer something else to keep it interesting. Awesome.
Citrus is not as strong in the taste, but the malts come in a lot more to help out. Grapefruit at the start is juicy and pungent, and is quickly complemented by toffee/caramel malt that gives it a bit of sweetness. Pine and a harsh bitterness finish the beer, giving it a nice dry ending. The hops are a bit dank as well which I like. It's a hop bomb to be sure; not what the smell would predict, but an awesome hop bomb nonetheless.
Mouthfeel is good for the style - crisp, slightly sticky, very dry finish, and a bit of harshness from the bitterness. This beer happens to do the dry part very well but the sticky part not as well - but the dryness wins out for sure. Drinkability is helped a lot by that dryness as it's the last thing the palate feels here. Intense aromas remain throughout the beer and flavors are fine as the beer warms. I had a tough time making the glass last, as the awesome dryness at the end of sips was too much to make me resist another swig. Wasn't let down by this beer, and look forward to trading for it on an annual basis. 1,862 charactersveinless, Mar 30, 2011
4.39/5  rDev -1.6%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured into DFH signature glass. 
A: The beer's color is situated between deep gold and pale amber. An antique white head rises with the pour, but fails to stick around or produce any significant lacing. Slight haze on second pour. 
S: As soon as the can is popped open, the smell of a fresh tropical fruit salad drifts into the air. Impressive. Most prominent is ruby red grapefruit, with orange, papaya and maybe mango following further behind. Dank, pungent and fresh. 
T: Malts are present almost solely in a slight sweetness, seeming to strain under the enormous hop bill. The taste brings to mind having a red ruby grapefruit with a bit of sugar for breakfast. Some orange and orange zest, too. Not complicated, but bright and convincing. Hoppy finish that lingers pleasantly. 
M: Prickly carbonation somehow works with oily feel and compliments bitterness. Not obviously warming. 
D: I have to keep reminding myself that I'm drinking a potent beer; otherwise, I would easily crush another can or two and get into trouble. 
Thanks to joshuaseresse for opportunity. 1,076 charactersWadsey, Mar 30, 2011

A- dirty reddish orange. White one inch head crowns this beauty. Descending rings of lace surround my glass. Great looking beer.
S- mango sweet tangy cantaloupes. Some pine and small amounts of hop dank creep into the fruit frenzy.
T- grapefruit mixed with orange juice and hoppy mango. Huge flavors that are real tasty. Bitter and sweet battle for a stronghold and Im first row for the fight.
M- bitter puckering feel That is so nice. Medium feel That is really easy to drink. Very bitter but so good.
Overall a great iipa. The tastes jump out of the glass and smack you in the mouth. Fruity and Bitter just like I like em. I want to say balanced but even the sweet is bitter. A specific flavor profile done right. 759 charactersKelly88, Mar 29, 2011
4.45/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5BIG thanks goes out to KJ (aka mulletjunky) for hooking me up with some cans of Abrasive. I've been waiting to try this DIPA, so here we go...
A: Pours a somewhat clear (minus the chill haze) dark honey with a creamy white head. Some moderate lacing is left behind, as well as a foam cap sip through swallow. A rather impressive and beautiful DIPA.
S: Notes of sweet, tart and juicy pineapple up front followed by mango. Further in are aromas of fresh cut grass, black pepper and a mild hint of red onion.
T: Not as bitter as I would expect up-front, instead a mild blend of orange and papaya are first. Then comes some grassy wet hops, finished by a residual red onion flavor, however, it is nothing like the onion taste in say, GUBNA. Very well done.
M: Medium-bodied with ample carbonation, nothing is overdone or understated. A wonderful mouth feel though unfortunately not nearly as creamy like a PtE feel, which to me was perfect.
This beer is definitely worth seeking out and makes me wish Surly distributed in PA. An absolutely fantastic DIPA in its own regard. 1,074 charactersShanePB, Mar 29, 2011

A- Slightly hazy golden hue with a decent white cap that has OK retention. A small ring and cloud leaves a few rings of lace.
S- Pungent pine, peach and citrus with some strange onion thing. Light malt and bread.
T- A ton of hops lending citrus, floral, pine, juicy peach and the onion thing again. Slight bread and sweetness. Dank.
MF- Creamy substantial body with a good amount of carbonation and a pretty big bitterness.
DB- Drinks well for how big it is and the amount of hops. The onion thing is a bit odd but I still enjoy this beer. 584 characterscbutova, Mar 27, 2011

A- Booming white one inch head in my tulip. Beer is dark golden to light orange with a dozen nucleation sites causing effervescence. Great head retention and lacing.
S- Could smell citrus/hops immediately from a foot away when I popped the top!
T- Pungent dankity dank-dankness. Both citrus and pine make and appearance.
M- Slightly syrupy but with a biting carbonation on the tongue.
D/O- What a delicious brew! Alcohol is well hidden making this pint-sized can no match. For as much hype as Hopslam gets, I'd have to give Abrasive the nod over it. #1 DIPA in the land? This would get plenty of votes and rightfully so. "When in Minnesota and you got a drinking quota." 692 charactersDuff27, Mar 22, 2011
4.17/5  rDev -6.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4.5The canned on date has become illegible, but it was likely canned sometime in January.
Poured into surly snifter, and allowed to slowly warm up...
Appearance: Pours with a very nice white head which bellows up the glass, sticks around momentarily, and dissipates leaving some light bubble rim on the beer. The color is leaning towards golden orange, very clear. Not any lacing to speak of.
Smell: From the moment the can is opened, the hops definitely come center stage. There is some real weight behind the hops too, some slightly floral, citrusy, piney, and definitely resinous notes. The alcohol smell seems to pair with the assertive smell of the hops which is actually really nice. Some definite malt on the nose in sense of some balancing sweetness, though the hops seem to dominate the nose...which isn't any problem what so ever.
Taste: Some really clean hop bitterness with some slightly earthy and ester overtones, though pretty well hop specific. There is more of a malt presence on the taste which works to try and balance the hops without overshadowing their potency. The booze isn't really evident, and it's astringency works with the bitter dryness of the hops. nice hop profile which isn't lost in the sweetness of the malt, which to me seems like a balanced, hop forward IIPA.
Mouthfeel: Certainly on the dry side, but for sake of not loosing that clean hop bitterness, i'm fine with that. For a double ipa, this is very smooth, albeit it a likely palette wrecker. The hop profile of this beer is really beautiful, and it's just an enjoyable beer overall.
Overall: Well the drinkability...haha...i mean Overall, this beer is really memorable. For the hop heads among us, who are looking for a bigger beer, with a big hop profile devoid of big sweetness or chewiness, this is definitely worth searching out. I will certainly search this out in the future. 1,877 charactersamcmaho1, Mar 21, 2011

Thanks to VDubb86 via hannydawg for sharing this can!
I'm glad to be trying this brew having heard such great things about it from everyone else. it pours a mostly clear sunrise amber topped by a finger of slightly off-white foam. The nose comprises onion, strong mint, parsley, and some light caramel basking in the background. The taste holds notes of orange peel, cilantro, very light onion, black pepper, greens, very light caramel, light pine, and light mint. The body straddles the line between heavy light and light medium, with a mild carbonation and a dry, sticky finish. Overall, a very nice DIPA. It's a bit unbalanced toward the hops, but it never becomes o'erwhelming in that direction. 724 charactersTMoney2591, Mar 21, 2011

Thanks to hannydawg for letting me try this awesomeness
This beer pours a clear copper color with a bone white head on the surface. The nose smells like a hop plant there is some pine cone in that hop smell and a hint of malt in the background. The first taste and holy god hops. There was the initial mouthfull of terroir was potent, but subsequent sips are much less "abrasive". There is a pretty decent flavor to it as well, there is a sweet caramel malt flavor behind the bitter hops. The hops are really nice, and actually finish as a minty flavor. This mouthfeel isn't problematic to the palate in the slightest. Overall this is an excellent beer. I'm glad that I have this in my glass right now. 720 charactersVdubb86, Mar 20, 2011

Wife out with friends? Check!

Let the festivities begin. 
Poured from a can into a Crate and Barrel Bruges snifter.
A - This beer pours one of the most wonderful orange hues i have yet seen in an IPA. The head is a fluffy white and i can tell that this is one oily beer cause its clinging to dear life on the sides of the glass. Im not even yet seeing any lacing since the head is only receding in the middle and not the sides. I cant wait.
S - This IS THE BEST SMELLING IPA EVER!!! The moment i open the can i get wafted with some incredible dank pine. More so than i have ever experienced. This is one of the most citrus forward Imperial IPA's i have smelled yet. I'm also getting some over-ripened mango and pineapple. 
T - Hopslam, you've met your match! Huge and malty yet sharp and bitter. This is such a balanced beer i can hardly believe it. This has such a strong citrus fruit base yet i get some caramel and brown sugar on the malt backbone. The hops definitely center stage here though. This in not a beer i would ever expect to come from the midwest (no-offence). I could swear there is some honey in this beer as well, which is what why i immediately thought of Hopslam. Bravo Surly.
M - Thick and oily. Decent carbonation for the style, very reminiscent of the light, yet full Hopslam bubbles. 
O - This is by far one of the best examples of an Imperial IPA. This experience reminds me of the first time i had the pleasure of sampling Pliny. Its kinda eye opening. I cant plead enough for Surly to distribute this to California. I would give up many of our wonderful beers to have this on a regular basis. 1,701 charactersdubinsky, Mar 20, 2011

T: Again, grapefruit and rind first and foremost. LOTS of grapefruit. There is a piny flavor and bitterness on the end as well as some caramel malt flavors. The bitterness doesn't linger at all. Again, amazing.
M: Medium body and carbonation, this beer beer almost seems creamy and crisp. The creaminess I imagine is from the strong malt backbone, but it works well with the grapefruit flavors.
O: Overall, a phenomenal DIPA. Definitely the most grapefruit-forward I've had and probably my second favorite DIPA. Amazing, amazing beer. 783 charactersn2185, Mar 19, 2011
4.42/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5A - Pours a orange-amber with a fluffy one finger off-white head. Nice retention, spotty lacing, not bad looking but nothing exceptional. 
S - Wow, this may be the most citrus-centric beer I've experienced. Huge grapefruit and some zing from lemon at the end. Sweet malt profile on the backend. 
T - Tasted better then the aroma. Huge rugged grapefruit without the "dry" acidic taste that come from a big hop profile. Ends nice and juicy with lemon peel, and maybe some sweeter tangerine. Plenty of medium sweet malts on the back, but not syrupy sweet. Really excellent balance with great flavor. 
M - Decent enough, medium body, quite a carbonated punch. Could be a touch thicker and chewier. 
O - Probably my new favorite DIPA because I'm a citrus hop fan. Grapefruit and lemon pack a huge punch, but you don't get that "tired palate" syndrome like some DIPA's cause. Perfect malt background, good aroma, decent mouthfeel...this is a solid beer with a great taste. 970 characterschilly460, Mar 18, 2011
4.44/5  rDev -0.4%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A: Solid. Nothing exceptional here. Fairly deep amber with decent head and retention settling to a nice and persistent ring.
S: Big blast of what I'm guessing are Summit hops up front; all meaty and vegetal. Some crisp pine follows (what my lady calls pine trees) with some rich fruit. Not lean, yet very much hop centric Very strong aroma wafting from my NB globe. I could happily smell this all night...
T: Oh yum. Very nice balance here. Malt is unobtrusive but is there enough to provide richness and balance to the strong hop flavors. Still guessing this is Summit driven with its strong vegetal notes, but intensly woodsy (not wood-y) on the finish with a wonderful lingering bitterness. Some citrus mid-palate.
M: Excellent. Rich but not thick. Crisp but not lean. A mouthful of BIG IPA, but refreshed by an absolutly perfect level of carbonation for this brew.
O: Damn. I have found a non-West Coast DIPA that swings for the fences. I'd put this up against any IPA I've ever had, and happily drink with regularity were that possible (only one can...). Someone send me more! 1,081 charactersoregone, Mar 17, 2011

Let me just cut to the most exceptional aspect of this beer...
It's smell is the sweetest, stickiest, hoppiest deliciousness ever. I swear, I wish I could spin thread from this beer and crochet it into a scarf I could wrap around my face...
I wish I could make those little pine tree air fresheners that smell like this and hang them everywhere in my house...
I wish you smelled like this beer. We'd hang out more. A lot more, and we might be something more than friends...
As an aside, I am thinking that if I could get this silly fresh, the taste score would come closer to the smell score. 651 charactersjohnbjaeger, Mar 17, 2011
4.95/5  rDev +11%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Really excited to enjoy this. 16 oz. can poured into my newly acquired Surly pint glass. Thanks to TIMMYJ21 for both the can and the glass. Can dated 02/28/11.
Appearance is a clear bright orange. Head creamy white and maybe two fingers. Lacing beautifully, peaks and valleys look great, exactly like the style should look. The lace sticks in patches.
Aroma is fantastic!! Hop BOMB!! Pink grapefruit, lemon peel? Sweet malt bill. A bit of alcohol. 
The taste is more fantastic than the smell. Sweet hop candy!!
The hop bill is not overpowering but balanced very well? It has the taste of chewing on the green juicy cones of a hop plant. Perhaps one smothered in malt syrup! I know this is seasonal and winter brewed but I don't think it is a fresh hopped beer. What I do think is that this tastes like a fresh hopped beer and if it were brewed year round, the country would run out of hops. 
Mouthfeel could be a little stickier, but it is definitely chewable. Carbonation is spot on, and now that I am almost finished, my tongue is starting to feel a little wrecked. Full-bodied, very big to the end. 
Overall consistent with a very well aged barleywine, except with hops still in your face, and the alcohol still hidden. If I could I would drink a 4 pack a night...but I'd probably lose my job. This beer lived up fully to my expectations. I want more, more, and more. Period. What else can I say? 1,404 charactersazdback, Mar 16, 2011
4.7/5  rDev +5.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Appearance:
Tonight I pulled out one of my favorite pint glasses, a simply deigned yet classy looking Cigar City pint which has a sketch of a lit cigar on it with their name. As I cracked open the tall boy can there was a generous amount of hissing and carbonation gasses that escaped the wide mouth. In the pour I decided to start by tilting the glass pretty hard just in case it wanted to foam up on me. As I continued it was safe to say that I could stand the glass back up and resume. After I was done pouring for a few seconds I noticed that I was left with a one finger thick creamy off white head that resembled almost a coco butter hue . When I hold the glass up to the light I'm getting burnt orange and deep honey colors that almost lean towards copper. There is no light passing through and it comes off a little bit murky but there are no yeast chunks or sediment floating around. On the swirl the viscosity appears pretty thick for an imperial IPA, leaving some nice legs and foam trails creeping down the glass walls.
Smell:
As soon as I cracked open the can, a rush of citrusy pine-grapefruit sunny delight goodness washed over me. This is exactly what I want a Imperial IPA to smell like! All the best aromas of fruitier dry hopping burst through, grapefruit, mango, orange, lemon zest, some spicy floral notes. In the finish a sweet caramel and toffee base that wraps up all of the hop aroma, this is just too good to be true. I almost don't want to drink it quite yet, but rather sit and sniff it for a while.
Taste:
I think I just melted into the couch, seriously. This has such a strong citrus fruit forward base that it almost could pass a highly hopped fruit beer. Huge and malty yet sharp and bitter this is a perfect yin and yang scenario. Caramel and burnt brown sugar make up the backbone of this beer but the hops definitely are the attention getter providing mangoes, lemons, and grapefruits. Light tones of pepper, and even some cherries poke through and oddly enough even a touch of vanilla. Pine and tree sap are there as well which reminds me of being at a Christmas tree farm. In the finish there is just a tiny little amount of heat alcohol that goes away very quickly and doesn't resemble a 9% beer at all.
Drinkability:
If you like a tongue bruising hop bomb then this is definitely drinkable. This is a very good representation of the style, but what else would you expect from Surly? In my opinion this is a great example of what kind of various flavors you can get from hops. I am going to go out on a limb here and rate this as one of the five best Imperial IPAs I ever had, due to flavor and drinkability. If you are a alpha acid, hop head like me this is a beer that you will need to find or trade for. Again, I want to give a big thanks to Corey for hooking me up with this special treat becuase it was worth every last drop. 2,875 charactersBmoyer0301, Mar 15, 2011
4.35/5  rDev -2.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A: golden coppery color with decent transparency (still a bit of haze). An aggressive pour yielded little head that quickly disappeared leaving a thin ring around the edges. It didn't feel overly carbonated when I popped the can, but there are clearly some bubbles rising up from the nether regions, so here's hoping.Decent lacing, if not a bit sparse.
S: Some sweet malt, nice hop earthy bitterness, aromatic hop fruity flavors, a bit piney some grapefruit.
T: Taste was average at first, but this really grows on you and opens up after every taste. This is quite delicious. sweet, citrusy, earthy, hoppy but not too hoppy. Very smooth, almost creamy. Drinks like a pale ale.
M: Carbonation levels are actually acceptable despite my initial visual inspection. Great mouthfeel, crisp, light and nice sweet after taste. Like I said, drinks like a pale ale.
D: Can't even tell this is 9%, damn. This is another very tasty brew from Surly. Very drinkable. 956 charactersjulian, Mar 15, 2011

A: Pours a glowing slightly hazy caramel-amber color with a billowing, dense off-white head that slowly bubbled away into a rocky layer that left sticky sheets of lacing down the glass.
S: Extremely fresh and hoppy notes of freshly cut grass and a hint of sweet pineapple and tropical fruits. 
T: Follows the nose with a huge tropical fruit and fruit nectar taste. Grass is there in the finish with a blast of bitter grapefruit pith. There is just a hint of caramel that tastes like it has been drizzled over pineapple slices. 
M: Medium slick body with fine yet tingly carbonation that leaves the mouthfeel spritzy but smooth.
D: Bitter and sweet with a good dose of grapefruit. I liked it overall, but I've had better. There is nothing wrong with this DIPA though, and after three of them I'm feeling like I could keep drinking more! Thanks again Chris for sending me a handful of these! 994 charactersscottfrie, Mar 15, 2011
3.75/5  rDev -15.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.5Notes from a few days ago.
My first of the Surly's infamous canned beers. I'm having this right after HopSlam, it's fun to compare 2 beers of the same style (though this was very different.) Canned on 2/28/11, so very fresh at 11 days old.
Pours dark orange with substantial white head eventually turning to a thick ring and slight cap. Leaves some lacing.
Earthy, lemon, piny dank hops...definitely has the 'onion' hops that alot of people connect with Gubna. It does smell very fresh, and it's good, but not my top choice for hops.
Taste is mostly the same. Grapefruit and lemon as far as fruits go, but mostly emphasized on earthy/onion-y hops. Grassy hops as well. Not overly bitter, there is some malt backbone at work, but no obvious flavor from it (maybe some caramel).
Light, smooth mouthfeel pretty similar to HopSlam. Alcohol well-hidden. 853 charactersChico1985, Mar 14, 2011
4.12/5  rDev -7.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Thanks go out to Tolann for providing this beer, which I poured into a tulip. 
According to Surly's website, Abrasive was originally called 16 Grit, a size of abrasive grit used at the old Abrasive factory that once stood where the brewery now resides. It was first brewed in 2008 to mark the end of Surly's growler sales, but they underestimated its demand and soon after made it a winter seasonal. It's one of the few DIPAs out there made with oats -- let's see how it affects the drink. 
The beer's extremely cloudy caramel-orange in color, with a foamy half-finger head of cream-colored bubbles that fizzles away quickly. Sticky, thick horizontal streaks of lace dot the glass as I drink. 
Warrior and Citra hops combine in the nose to create aromas of green olives and salt, a bit of herbal basil and onions, toffee and old grapefruit. It's very sweet and very rich. 
The flavor: pine, lots of honey liqueur, basil, grass, lavender, overripe oranges and heavy alcohol. Very rich flavor. 
A shade under medium in body, soft and smooth, with hops imparting a bracing bitterness on all aspects of the tongue. Carbonation is very light, with a tiny bit of fizziness as it moves about. Lightly noticeable alcohol in the nose and flavor, tongue-numbing but not distracting. 
Abrasive is much more approachable than its name suggests. Nice, caramelly maltiness paired with inviting hops. Good stuff. 1,404 charactersPhelps, Mar 14, 2011

Poured in to my Portsmouth snifter
A: This beer pours a hazy orangish, light copper color with a 1/4 inch of bone white head. Head recedes to a thing film almost immediately. Minor spots of lacing are left behind.
S: Nose is of fresh, juicy hopes - pineapple, mango, and a touch of and grapefruit citrus. Light caramel malt presence is also slightly detectable.
T: Taste starts nice and juicy, mango and pineapple mingled with a touch of caramel malt come through. Malt presence remains through the middle albeit lightly. Finish brings out a piney hop presence mingled with a grapefruit bitterness. 
M: Medium body, medium carbonation, nice oily feeling on the body. 
D: Goes down easily, very tasty, not too filling, well hidden kick and a great representation of style. This is a ridiculously drinkable DIPA. No alcohol is remotely detectable and the taste is phenomenal. This beer could definitely get me in trouble! 1,021 charactersJayli, Mar 14, 2011

T- Follows the nose well. Great flavor of grapefruit, pineapple and citrus again. Abrasive. Nice hop bitterness throughout.

Appearance: The body of the beer is a reddish orange coloration. The head of the beer is white and thin no head retention noted. Specks of lacing remain on my glass. 
Smell: Loads of pine and grapefruit greet my nose. Juicy pineapple, mango and an idealized Sunny D citrus aroma. 
Taste: Taste like I bit into a pine cone. In a great sort of way. Lots of grapefruit citrus juicy hops very bitter but very enjoyable. A flash of toasted caramel flavors breaks up the bitterness and oddly enough serves to reassert the hops. Very well done!
Mouthfeel / Drinkability: The body of the beer is moderate with lively carbonation. Nice long lasting bitterness. This beer is drinking fantastically and I wish I had a case of it. I could drink this beer all night long. 887 charactersnlmartin, Mar 13, 2011

Had a fresh (5-day old) full can on 2011-12-23 in Columbia, PA and ammended some comments and scores upwards.  Had another fresh can on 2015-12-10.  So good.  This 2015 one is more dank than the last one I had. Had this again on 2016-11-14 in Warrenville, IL
A - Slightly hazy straw with maybe a hint of orange. 3-finger white head and moderate lacing.
S - Very strong aroma with with lots of mango, peach, pineapple to a lesser extent, some pine, light grain, crushed-in-your-hand hop cones. Top notch.
T - Bold, bright and bitter grapefruit juice, tropical flesh and light caramel malt sweetness, plenty of pine and some mint. Aftertaste is a nice combination of tart-citrus and pine with a touch of sweetness and plenty of lingering bitterness as it dries.
M - Light-medium body and medium carbonation. Smooth, prickly, moderately resinous.
O - It's not quite as wonderful smelling as a fresh Heady-Topper or a Pliny the Elder but it is very close. To me it tastes on par with these other two brews. It has more balancing malt/fruit than the Heady-Topper, more abrasive bitterness than the Pliny (the most balanced), and more pine than either of them. Great stuff, any way you slice it. 1,325 charactersTucquan, Mar 13, 2011
4.18/5  rDev -6.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Matt - Thanks again!
Canned 02/28/2011 -- Consumed 03/11/2011
Appearance -- Pours an almost rosy orange with a slim sudsy beige cap. Sitting on the table, it just BEGS to be consumed. 
Smell -- Tangerine and tropical fruits, dry prairie grasses, mild Simcoe cattiness. I have a hard time locking down the malts from the nose; the juicy fruits are really popping, but otherwise it smells dry and slightly toasted. Furious + juicy fruits?
Taste -- Front end is all bright and juicy citrus, followed in short order by Simcoe pungency and resin. Malt sweetness is fine-tuned: just enough to really make those aromatic hop notes pop but still leaves the hop buttering forceful. Mid-palate golden toast meets with caramel and candied orange zest. Lingering flavor of tangerine rind and green onion.
Mouthfeel -- Medium bodied with moderate prickly carbonation. The bubbles themselves have a fine feeling - very gentle on the tongue, but still lively. High marks.
Drinkability -- Pretty damn good, depending on your opinion toward Simcoe. Anyone who associates Simcoe with cat piss, or liver and onions - don't bother with this one. For the rest of us, this is an incredible DIPA that tastes like a bigger, juicier Furious. Not my favorite DIPA ever, but certainly another EPIC IPA from Surly. 1,292 charactersyeahnatenelson, Mar 12, 2011

A: Deep copper color. Relatively little head after an average poor. Lacing coats the side of the glass beautifully.
S: Holy citrus!Tons of grapefruit coming through here. Very intense hop aroma. Loving it!
T: An even more concentrated hoppy citrus smack in the face. I can see why they call this one abrasive. A little malt comes through at the end, but mostly just bitter, fruity hops. Precisely what I look for in an American DIPA. Very tasty.
M: Love the feel of this one. It's thick and juicy. An almost oily texture coats the mouth with every sip. 
D: A little too heavy to have more than 1 or 2 of these in a sitting. 
An exceptional brew from Surly. Much better than Furious in my opinion. 766 characterslangept, Mar 12, 2011

Poured into a Guinness pint glass.
I really enjoyed this beer from the start. After the initial pour a beautiful white head appeared about an 1/8 of an inch above the glass. It faded rather quickly, but left a nice lacing around the brim. Has an intense smell of piney hops, which I really enjoy. The taste is almost identical to the smell, very bitter, but in a good way. The drinkability on this one is pretty high considering the 9% ABV. I could easily put down a 4-pk of these, but I wouldn't recommend driving afterward. 631 charactersbrian44556, Mar 09, 2011

A: A deep golden orange color with a nice perfect one finger white head. Ring lacing on the glass sticks.
S: Holy hops! Huge juicy citrus smells with grapefruit, pineapple, lemon with pine notes coupled with a big sweet juicy caramel malt smell. Wow, just wow.
T: Hot damn, this is a hophead's dream. The citrus hops on this beer is crazy. Huge amounts of grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, lemon and some sweeter mango like fruit. You just want to squeeze the fruit juices out of this beer. The fruit is followed by a heavy caramel sweetness that blends just perfectly with the hops. Again, wow. Finish turns bitter with some pine flavors, the juicy fruit flavors stay and the sweetness lingers to keep the entire flavor lasting. What a kick ass beer.
M: Full, coating, prickly, juicy, a bit of alcohol (much welcomed) and perfect carbonation.
D: For 9%? Wow, this is so enjoyable and drinkable. Dangerous if it was on draft. Dangerous period.
Overall I am just blown away. This rivals the best of the DIPAs and is probably the best DIPA just behind PtE. Amazingly good. I just wish this brewer could ship stuff outside their state so everyone could realize just how damn good these beers are. Furious and Abrasive might just be the best IPA/DIPA combo made today. Wow, just wow. Lucky for me I still have 3 more to enjoy. Stellar. 1,426 charactersKadonny, Mar 07, 2011

A - Golden umber, high effervescence for the style, big billowing white head of 3 fingers. Leaves intricate, heavy lacing. A stunner visually.
S - Grapefruit, pineapple, super bitter and earthy hops. A touch of sweetness from the malt emerges as well.
T - Tongue-numbing, palate destroying, citrus and grassy hops dominate. A hint of honey and fresh bread represent the malt bill, but they are very much on the defensive.
M and D - Thin to medium body, oily, finishes somewhat dry. The strong bitterness keeps you drinking.
An excellent Midwestern DIPA. I'd love it if the cans were available here.
3/6/15 - Well, the cans are available here, and expensive. But, this is everything I described a few years back and maybe even more. A monster IIPA that highlights Citra and Warrior hops in perfect balance with a full body enhanced by the oatmeal. Falls somewhere between Hopslam and Haymarket's Mathias as the best imperial IPA in the upper Midwest. 1,015 charactersAJacob81, Mar 07, 2011

can poured into my New Belgium glass
Pours a near perfect amount of creamy yellow head. I actually took a step back after pouring just to admire. I pour so few of my beers from a can that I was really impressed by this one from Surly
Smell was certainly hop-forward. I caught some grapefruit but as I continued to imbibe I sensed more of a sour, almost body odor aroma, not out of the genre but a little off for my preference
Tastes of a classic DIPA, hoppy, grape-fruity with just a touch of sweetness to create a nice balance.
Nice amount of carbonation with smooth drinking. The ABV is right on for the style. I could drink this on the regular but it's definitely not an easy one to acquire. 753 charactersCruisaC, Mar 07, 2011

4.59/5  rDev +2.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Received in a trade with UMNbeerhunter, and poured into a Spiegelau tulip.
Appearance: Pour yields a dark orangish-amber liquid with a half-finger of bright white head consisting of very large bubbles. Decent retention considering the amount of head, and some great lacing finds its way down the sides of the glass. This is darker than I imagined it to be, but it's very pleasant in appearance.
Smell: As soon as I cracked open the can, a rush of citrusy pine-grapefruit goodness washed over me. This is exactly what I want a Double IPA to smell like. Juniper and fresh-cut pine reminds me of hiking in the forests of Colorado, and the citrus notes definitely take me to a breakfast table with fresh-squeezed lemons and grapefruits. Not much in the way malts, but that could be because my nose just got dominated by the fresh hops, but all in all, this is one of the best noses I've ever smelled.
Taste: Just like the nose, this one is so hop-forward; you might as well be sucking on a whole-cone C-hop. The citrus hits you straight in the mouth, and the pine intermingles its way in so as to create a very fresh flavor combination on your palate. The back-end rounds out a little bit, but the tart finish reminds you that this is a bad-ass DIPA that you just consumed.
Mouthfeel: At first blush, it's very crisp and almost refreshing with the way it combines so many fresh flavors. But, this is deceiving as the dry, tart ending finishes remarkably sticky. I like my DIPAs to be heavy, and this one certainly has its moments, but it's not so overwhelming to be off-putting.
Drinkability: The 9% ABV and the size of the can (16oz) are the only two reasons why this beer doesn't earn a perfect score for drinkability. I love the smoothness of the hops, and the little bit of maltiness lets you know this is still a beer, but there's no debate over what style this precious liquid is that's gracing your tongue. Awesome extra Joe! 1,933 charactersCOBeerBuff, Mar 05, 2011

Pours a beautiful clear golden amber with great carbonation and a creamy white head.
Smell is all fruity hops with so many layers of citrus and just a hint of malt. 
Taste is juicy tropical and citrus hops with just the right amount of sweetness. 
Great body and carbonation really round out a beer that I could drink all day. 413 charactersLunch, Mar 04, 2011
4.69/5  rDev +5.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Major thanks to GeezLynn for 134 ounces of IIPA heaven. Reviewed live. 
The look is the classic cloudy and thick amber of fine IIPA's. Highly refractive, under copious lace mountains. 
I've gotten to love this aroma through savoring eight cans of this luscious brew (this is no. 8 now). All the best aromas of fruitier dry hopping, grapefruit, mango, orange, even lemon zest, some spicy floral, floating on sweet goodness. Doesn't get better than this, folks. It sets off sprinkler systems in the saliva glands.
What a taste! Full flavored, starting with a bit of neutral sweet, super clean, which carries into a sweet chorus of citrus, floral, light pine, bitter pith, finally being balanced with the fine bittering hop, really fruity even here, very nice, I've grown to love this balance. The complexity is in how it keeps coming up with new flavors in the mix, and the finish is at times super dry, at times fruity and a touch juicy, though always in a tongue scrapingly fine way. The balance of it always seems subtly to be shifting, but somehow always balanced. Stunning taste, absolutely delicious!
Mouthfeel is about as good as my other two faves in this style (Pliny The Elder, Heady Topper), near perf. carb, attenuation, hop resin, finish.
Drinkability is good as it gets. It gets a 5 because this is the first time I've cried knowing I'm consuming my last of a certain brew.
Impression: All my words are superfluous, except these ---&gt; Do you like IIPA's? If so, get this beer, you will f***ing love it! 1,522 characterscavedave, Mar 03, 2011
4.72/5  rDev +5.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Poured into my tulip. A beautiful copper color with some sediment at the bottom of the glass. Nice frothy thick white heading that left lacing all throughout the tasting.
Smell is insane you get a flash of the greener hops along with the heavy fruity notes,mango,papaya,pineapple. The nose reminds me alot of Hopslam.
Taste is sublime.Very much like the nose. Heavy fruity hop notes,slightest of caramel sweetness and high sugary alcohol that hurts the cavities.Slight boozey feeling towards the end. Citra hops are in full force here.
Mouth is very alive on the palate with excellent carbonation.A little syrupy but in no way a hassle.
A beautiful sweet treat. This will round out my top 3 IIPA's of all time. IF anyone can ship cases I will be willing to trade. Thanks to shir0043. 787 charactersTheFightfan1, Mar 03, 2011

Thanks to rshellman for the trade
A: Pours a deep amber with a quickly disapating white head, when agitated, an oily lacing drapes the glass.
S: Dank hops dominate, there is a pungency that I've only ever noticed from Alpine beers... possibly a very strong hopback? anyways, fruity and tangy aromas with a slight "rain on hot asphalt" type smell.. in a good way. It's the lupulin oil standing up and shouting strong
T: Grapefruit rind and other citrus notes.. a sweet come on of malty flavor, well balanced. then piney astringency hinting at bitterness but never overwhelming. Alcohol speaks here to.. warming going down but well hidden in the overall profile.
M: I'd say somewhere between medium and full bodied. The gravity is evident. Oily and mouthcoating
D: I'd drink the hell out of this... I want some more Rob! 860 charactersBrlyHpsWtrYst, Mar 02, 2011

There is a reason this beer is world renown and highly sought after, it's really f*cking good! Big juicy peach & tangerine nose makes way for a damper'd bitter grapefruit. Big sexy mouthfeel keeps you interested as this beauty starts cold, but warms in your hands. I could have drank this all night, really. I poured a few sips for a couple of friends and they all wanted more of it, bad, but it was all mine! Too bad we can't get this in WI yet. 479 charactersburnheartsMKE, Mar 01, 2011

4.65/5  rDev +4.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured from a 16oz can into a Town Hall Barrel Aged Week tulip. Last beer of the night 2/24/11.
Pours a pretty golden amber with a good head and decent lacing after a minute or so.
Smell is intoxicating. Tons of pine, malt, and citrus notes. Great mix for a DIPA
Taste is awesome as well. Hops and pine tones over whelm the awesome malt backbone but it feels strangely right to a hophead like me to enjoy the hops over the very sweet maltiness of this beer.
Mouthfeel is good. It coats you mouth with good hop resins and is moderate in the mouth weight.
Drinkability is high on this one for me. I wish this was one of Surly's year around. I love this beer. 661 charactersUMNbeerhunter, Feb 28, 2011

A: Aggressive pour creates size-able head that pulls back quickly. Red panda wearing white lace stockings.
S: Tons of tropical fruit and fresh oily hops punch you in the face as soon as you put your nose in the glass. Mango, pineapple, grapefruit, clementine, and even cherry. Strong undercurrent of caramel and vanilla. Mmmm mmm good.
T: I had my mom who hates IPAs (mainly hops) try this and she said, "is that an IPA? Its really fruity and not very bitter at all". The citrus hops have a nice sort of tang about them, but finish with a slight earthy bite. This is going to sound really bad, but its reminding me of the total onion flavor most people seem to get from GUBNA. That said, this one does not taste like onions, no worries. Malts backbone offers a nice sweetness to really carry the juicy hops all the way along.
M: Nice medium body with the perfect level of carbonation. Its not syrupy, but it makes you think it is. Has a nice full creaminess too it.
D: So crisp and fruity I want more and more. This one has quickly pushed its way up there in my books. The only thing stopping it from a perfect score here is the fact that well...it actually is 9% even though you would never know. 1,333 charactersDrazzamatazz, Feb 28, 2011

A- Pours a deep ruby color with a two finger lacy white head. Looks rich and promising.
S- A crisp sweet texas grapefruit smell wafts out as soon as you crack the can. Notes of hoppy-ness, pine and other citrus fruits, this is one damn fine smelling beer.
T- Hoppy and sweet, nicely balanced, there is a particular woodiness to it. Quite mellow, the citrus doesn't have as much punch as I was expecting.
M- The malt makes it really smooth and creamy, nice thick body and med-low carbonation. Not too dry for such a hop heavy brew.
D- This is a great IIPA. It is rich and creamy. One of, if not the best smelling beers I've encountered. The sweetness is really mellow and delightful, not overpowering. If you are going to bomb out your pallet for the night, this is the beer to grab. 803 characterssmm, Feb 28, 2011
4.15/5  rDev -7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 416oz can into taster glass.
from notes.
Pours a lightly hazy, dark orange-golden color with a bubbly foamy off-white head.
The aroma is of incredibly resiny pine, with very faint grapefruit.
Though the resinous pine notes are still the dominant flavors they do back off just enough to allow a bit more of the citric grapefruit to come through than in the nose. There is just a faint amount of malty cracker backing to give it a bit of balance.
The mouthfeel is pretty standard, with a medium body and fairly active carbonation with a dry finish.
The resiny notes are really the defining aspect of this beer, but without becoming the only characteristic to be found. The ABV is very well blended. 700 charactersvkv822, Feb 27, 2011

Pours a dark golden orange color with golden apricot/burnt orange hues when held to a light and a frothy, pillowy two finger off-white head. Excellent retention, only slowly fading into a lasting cap that coats the pint with large rings, streaks and chunks of soapy lacing. 
Sweet citrus hop aroma that's bursting with uber-fresh dank, floral hops. Lots of citrus and tropical fruit as well as some dank,oily, resinous pine character. There's a prominent pineapple and mango presence as well as hints of grapefruit, lemon and orange peel. Underneath, there's also a slight pale malt character that's slightly toasty with hints of biscuit and graham cracker. 
Fuller bodied than expected with a blast of ridiculously fresh, sweet floral hops that linger into a sweet, dry finish. Slightly earthy with subtle pine and dry bitterness which is complimented by sweet citrus and tropical fruit notes. Lots of juicy pineapple, mango, grapefruit and orange peel flavor which balances out the drier bitter notes perfectly. Faint toasty malt backbone with hints of biscuit and graham cracker. Just enough of this for complexity and balance without taking away from the glorious hop flavor. The ABV is very well masked with only faint heat toward the end of the swallow, making this beer extremely quaffable. 
Overall, this is a delicious and complex beer which is very well balanced and dangerously drinkable. Although it's bursting with sweet fruit flavor, it's not one-dimensional by any means, with an excellent compliment of dry earthy bitterness, subtle malt and alcohol heat. On par with some of the best west coast IPAs and very similar in flavor profile. 1,739 characterscorby112, Feb 26, 2011
4.3/5  rDev -3.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured from tap into standard pint glass. 
Appearance: Cloudy/Hazy golden with soapy foam head. Left nice sticky lacing as it receded. 
Smell: Sweet and floral/citrus hops all over the place! Has a very crisp and clean scent, but also a bit sweet and herbal/flowery.
Taste: A punch of bitter citrus hops right up front, but smooths out as it lingers on the tongue. A little smoother and mellower on tap than in the can, and the hops seem fresher and more prominent. 
Mouthfeel: Slippery and lower-carbonation. Medium bodied and crisp.
Drinkability: I love this stuff out of the can, and it's even better on tap. Delicious! Could drink this all night long, but at 9% ABV, I stopped after three pints. Had to drive home eventually that night. 745 charactersChopperSmith, Feb 25, 2011

Looks pretty damn good. Mid-orange toned body with a large offwhite head. Bigger bubbles that aren't going away quickly, but leave little lace. 
Mmm, mmm, lots of tropical fruit. Orange, pine, pineapple, and cantaloup aromas in a sweet embrace. Not so much caramel as sweet, juicy citrus and honey. Twinge of solvent.
Where's the bitterness? Medium-high levels, but it's not hitting me exceptionally hard. Mainly tropical fruit and orange hop flavors show up. There's so much pineapple that I almost feel like I'm drinking juice. Waves of caramel malt wash over everything. Bitterness gets more grapefruit pith at the end. 
Surprisingly low carbonation that I'm not really digging. The beer itself is exceedingly smooth, it must be those oats. I want more carbonation to pop all those hops on my tongue. Otherwise, it's a hell of a well crafted mouth. 
Since this isn't coming across as a palate wrecker to me, it's quite drinkable. The hops are very desirable and juicy.
Update 3/9/11: Upon consuming the second can, I cannot leave this score as it is. Drinkability goes up to 4.5 because of the lack of alcohol, loads of sweet mango and peach hops, and downright easy drinking. 1,318 charactersbrewerburgundy, Feb 25, 2011
4.17/5  rDev -6.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Canned on 1/24/11. The first seasonal Surly I've had. Figured I should start taking advantage of living in Minneapolis and give it a try. Also, full disclosure: I'm a bit of a beer newb, and this is one of the higher ABV beers I've had, and the first Double IPA I've had. 
Appearance: An orangeish honey color with a nice two finger head. Lacing sticks around for a while after each sip.
Smell: One of my favorite smelling beers. Big citrus hops. Pretty much just hops. Not complaining. Seemed to change to an almost piney smell towards the bottom of the glass.
Taste: First few sips are as advertised, abrsaive. Tongue is pretty much overwhelmed and requires more than one sip to figure out completely. Obviously lots of hops, with an alcohol aftertaste that seems to get lost by the bottom of the glass. Lots of citrus, orange in particular, with some grapefruit.
Mouthfeel: Pretty much how you'd expect for this. Bitter and abrasive, with a good deal of carbonation.
Drinkability: A dangerous beer. However, one night drinking this, I had a 16 oz can of Abrasive, followed by a different beer. I then decided I wanted a sip of the Abrasive she was drinking, and my tongue wanted no part of that. Perhaps my tongue just got used to drinking the more mellow beer I had, but the one sip I had tasted nothing like the beer I had a couple hours beforehand. 
A great beer, although side by side with Furious(Surly's year round IPA) in my liquor store I'm inclined to go with Furious. Definitely something I will pick up once per year when it is available, and possibly something I will come back to once I try a few more Double IPAs. 1,636 charactersRonnieBear, Feb 22, 2011

Abrasive pours an orange amber color with good head retention and lacing. While the beer looks pretty good, the nose on this bad boy immediately let me know I was in for a special treat. Wow. This beer packs a huge aroma profile of dry orange citrus, pine, a hint of pepper and a nearly overpowering aroma of dank earth and marijuana. It just doesn't get much better than this. On the palate, the flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely in this hugely bitter, well balanced (for a DIPA), dry on the finish DIPA. The finish is long and bitter in this beer, with just enough sweet malt to keep the hoppy bitterness in check (this is NOT an East Coast style DIPA). Drinkability is excellent in this DIPA. You can tell the abv. is up there, but the beer is not at all hot, with the alcohol perfectly integrated into the flavor profile.
Just an altogether excellent beer from Surly. I really liked the Furious, but would take Abrasive any day of the week over that excellent beer. Just delicious... 1,084 charactersJohn_M, Feb 21, 2011

A- Pours nice hazy honey color. Wants to be amber but not quite. Nice 1 finger white head. Leaves very sticky lacing after each sip.
S- Citrus hop burst at first. A little piney aroma noted in the middle, followed by nice malts. The citrus was right at the front, but the aroma tails off quickly. Would want a little more hop aroma. 
T- Lots of hop flavor up front in this beer. More of a fruity, followed by piney, lemony hop flavor. Much more than the nose led on on this. Subtle malts towards the end really cut into the bitterness and balance out perfectly. 
M- Medium body with moderate carbonation. Oily feel.
D- Awesome beer. Very excited that I got a 4 pack of this! Very good DIPA that I would drink again for sure!! 833 charactersHosP, Feb 21, 2011

A- Hazy burnt orange with a smallish head. Ok lacing for the first few sips. 3.
S- This aroma is REALLY nice. It hits you right off the bat with a wall of tropical fruits. Pineapple, white grapefruit, candied orange, tangerine, mango. There is a minimal crackery, almost caramel malt base. Pilsner malt? 5
T- Sweet oranges and pineapple are the main event. Its very sweet and packed with citrusy hops. Bitterness is minimal, its just there to keep things tied together. And tied together this beer is. Malts stay out of the way but lend a nice, light crackery presence. 4.5
M- Slick, medium body. Sharp carbonation. The finish is short and clean despite how hoppy and oily this stuff is. 4
D- This is great stuff. Its got to be some sort of IPA. Its not too big, just about right. 5
The reveal: Surly Abrasive! Kick ass, this is another big want. I really wish I could drink this stuff all the time. 1,039 charactersMbpBugeye, Feb 21, 2011
4.32/5  rDev -3.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Pours a hazy toasted straw color with a thick fluffy off-white head that slowly settles.
Big hoppy aroma profile. Seems heavy on pine with a good amount of grapefruit and tropical fruit notes. Some pepper action as well. This sucker is all hops.
Piney hops assault the palate with some herbal, grapefruit and pineapple notes to provide some flavor. A pale malt provides a solid bready base and provides some honey sweetness. The DIPA ends with a bit of a chalky asprin flavor.
Moderate feel with prickly carbonation. Very hoppy on the palate but there is some balance here. The scales definitely lean on the hoppy bitter side though. The finish is dry.
A hop forward DIPA with some balance. I can enjoy one can in a sitting anymore might burn a hole in the gut. 765 charactersGmann, Feb 21, 2011

A: Nice honey-orange pour with a nice two finger head of white froth that held for several minutes. Thick, bubbly lacing in the tulip. Quite a few floaters in there that are way too dark to be spent yeast, but should not deter those brave enough to try this one.
S: Beautiful big blast of spruce and pineapple. Like being in Hawaii and Northern Michigan at the same time. Love it. 
T: Abrasive is a good name for this ale. Bitter on the first sip - almost a tinge of pain as my salivary glands went from zero to 60 in a split second. Subsequent sips seemed much more balanced as I was better prepared for the hop blast. Sweet, honeylike start with a little spicy zing at the finish. Like this more and more the closer I get to the bottom of the glass. Could be the ABV talking.
M/D: All good here. Thought a 3.5 would be right for drinkability since my tongue feels like it has been rubbed with sandpaper, but I read the back label and the folks at Surly warned me, so I'll go 4.0 for delivering on what the brewer promised.
Unique ale that I would certainly have again, but no more than two in a session.
Relative Review: One part Short's Spruce Imperial Pilsner (for the nose) to three parts Moylan's Hopsickle, plus a dozen or more IBU's. 1,301 charactersAnother6Pack, Feb 20, 2011

A. Poured 3 fingers of head. Good retention. Pretty thick lacing. Color is a dark orange copper color. 
S. You can smell the hops on this one as soon as you crack open the can. Sweet heavenly hop aroma. One word to describe the smell of Abrasive is DANK. Dank hops. It smells like you have a hop cone in your hand. Nice bitter hop aroma. Really not a whole lot else you can smell except hops which is fine with me. You can smell the hop oils which is what really does the trick for me. Hop smell would be described as piney. 
T. Delicous beer. Very nice bitterness. Its been a while since I have felt the tongue coating bitterness that a bitter DIPA can provide. Has a smooth biscuity malt base underneath the hops the provide nice contrast. 
M. Medium bodied. Medium carbonation. Lingering bitterness. 
D. If you like a tongue bruising hop bomb then this is definitely drinkable. This is a very good beer, but what else would you expect from Surly. This is a very flavorful showcase of the flavors that hops can provide. Definitely reminds me of Furious. I would say this is pretty close to Furious' big brother. One of my top 5 DIPAs. 1,174 characterssiradmiralnelson, Feb 19, 2011

a - Cracked the can and poured into my Duvel tasting tulip. Poured a perfect honey color with lots of carbonation and bubbles and a bubbly frothy head with sticky lacing.
s - I could smell it from the table, but as I raised the glass to my nose, the perfectly balanced citric piney hops took me over. Fantastic smelling.
t - Surprisingly bitter. The balance in the nose is lost a bit on the taste as the hops dominate even further. Sticky grapefruit and some citric sweetness, but hop heavy and bitter.
m/d - Very nicely done double ipa, but a bit overly hopped on the taste for me. The nose was just right, but the taste was a bit bitter for me compared to some of the other double ipas I've had and loved. Easy drinker for the ABV. 852 characterscosmicevan, Feb 19, 2011
4.01/5  rDev -10.1%look: 4 | smell: 3 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Thanks to AwYeh for helping me acquire this delicious beer.
Appearance - Pours a cloudy orangish brown with a slight froth on the top. Less than a half finger of head with average to good lacing. This beers only transparency is from the shadow of your hand.
Smell - Slightly hoppy but not as strong as I expected from a double IPA. Sort of an orange and citrus zest to it as well. Slightly malty as well. A slight hint of caramel becomes more noticeable later on. 
Taste - A slight bitter start that smooths itself out into a crisp orange finish. The citrus notes from the smell definitely carry over and are accompanied by slight hints of barley and lemon. Hints of grapefruit are present as well. The bitterness gets more noticeable as drinking continues.
Mouthfeel / Drinkability
Easily drinkable for a 2XIPA. Not as bitter as I had hoped for, but extraordinarily drinkable in many other ways. The bitterness becomes more noticeable as you continue drinking. I had a small sample of this when I attended the February 5th at Jackie O's and really enjoyed the few sips I had. I was able to get a full can thanks to AwYeh and give this one a full review. 1,158 charactersJesse13713, Feb 18, 2011

Purchased At: Ale Jail (St. Paul, MN)
Appearance: The pour is a cloudy amber and burnt orange color. The beer is extremely effervescent with a thick trail of bubbles gasping for air. A few thick sheets of lace are on the side of my glass as well as a few small dots. Two fingers of head were resting at the top of the glass, but it's not lowered itself to a thin layer.
Smell: The nose is dripping with hops. A nice blend of grass, pine, mango and grapefruit. There's a bit of toffee malt sitting in the background, but it's doing just that, which is appreciated.
Taste: The tasting starts out with some toffee malt, but it never takes the upper hand in the tasting. Hops come through immediately; more grass and pine come through. There's some orange peel and mango that come through in the middle. The tasting ends with a nice squeeze of bitter grapefruit.
Mouthfeel: Carbonation is nearly spot on after opening; give it just a bit after opening and it's perfect. The beer is medium bodied and there's a nice oily coating on the teeth and gums from the hops.
Drinkability: I consider Furious one of the best IPAs in the country, and Abrasive steps it up a notch. This is an excellent beer, and I really wish Surly distributed to Wisconsin so I could buy their beer on a more regular basis. 1,319 charactersEk0nomik, Feb 18, 2011

(wait for it)
Abrasive.
Honestly I dig Furious more, and I've had a few other DIPA's with a different hop character that I liked just a little bit better. 
But I don't think that's what Surly's going for with this beautiful amber bodied bully. Because it is exactly what it says it is.
The half finger head from the can poured into my Surly pint glass yields a full citrus aroma, followed by Surly malts. It hits the tongue with sweet citrus, then bites you with pith. Absolutely bites. Like invading ... abrasive ... things. And then finishes clean with malts and that lovely Minnesota water. 
Well carbonated and medium bodied this bad boy clocks in at 9% alcohol by volume and would be incredibly drinkable for that % if the hops didn't linger so long on the tongue. Grapefruit, lemon, zowie, POW, bam, BAP, fwap!
I'm half-loving this beer and half-hating what it's doing to my palate. Major props to my trading buddy Mike for this brew. I don't want any more... and yet I want a case of it.
(One unrelated note: had side-by-side with Hopslam at a SB party, this one was king). 1,294 charactersafksports, Feb 18, 2011
4.45/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Got this one in a trade with hopscrazy! Thanks Brian! Really looking forward to this one!
A- Poured from a 16oz. can into a pint glass. Nice cloudy orange honey color. One finger creamy head disappears rather quickly, but leaves a nice sticky lacing around the glass. 
S- Fresh citrus, pineapple, mango, slight hoppiness matched well with sweet caramel malts. I wish it would pop into my nose a bit more, but maybe a pint wasnt the best choice for this one. Shoulda grabbed my tulip!
T- Fresh fruit right up front! Orange zest, mango, lemon... the malt and hops come in at the same time... perfect blend. Finishes with nice grapefruit/honey aftertaste! Just a touch of alcohol... not at all overwhelming. Delicious!!!
M- Again... the bitterness and sweetness blend seamlessly! Honey and pine... fresh citrus!!! Makes your mouth feel clean!
D- If I could get this where I am in NY... This would be my go to brew. Really nice balance. I'm a happy and hoppy man tonight! Damn... even my burps are citrusy and delicious!!! LOL!!! 1,030 charactersThickfreakness, Feb 17, 2011
4.8/5  rDev +7.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Poured from a 16oz can into a pint glass. HUGE thanks goes out to cavedave who included this long time want as an extra in our trade. I was happy to see a 1/4/11 on the bottom of the can not only because it means a fresh beer is waiting for me, but also because 1/4 is my birthday. This one was meant to be. 
A - Pours a dark honey copper color which is slightly hazy with a 1.5-finger billowy white head. Intricate lacing on the side of the glass forms as the head dissipates. 
S - Smells strongly of tropical fruits like mangos, tangerines, ang oranges. Big hop notes coming through in the nose. Wow, what a great fragrance!
T - The flavors are dominated big fruity tropical and citrusy flavors. The malt sweetness and slight caramel tastes work wonderfully here. The bitterness is surprisingly manageable and not overbearing at all. It doesn't drink like a big DIPA, but it clearly is one.
M - Medium to full bodied brew right here. The carbonation is perfect. It's dialed back enough to provide just the right amount of volume. There is a lightly sticky mouthfeel. Pretty much perfect.
D - I know the term "dangerously drinkable" gets tossed around a lot, but if that is the drinkability descriptor for any beer, this is the one. This beer is super refreshing. The alcohol is VERY well hidden. 
This is it. This is hands-down the best DIPA I've tried to date. Even though the new year recently began, I see Abrasive easily being one of the best of the year for me. 1,474 characterskevinv, Feb 17, 2011
4.82/5  rDev +8.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5My first review, after a long time lurking and reading other people's opinions. This beer is so good, it's inspired me to take the step. And I don't even like most hoppy beers.
A: Pours a lovely golden-orange color with a massive white head.
S: Heavy on the floral hops, with strong citrus and a decent amount of pine. I get grapefruit as the dominant scent. Malts are there, but masked by the strength of the hops.
T: Sweet, smooth, fruity, and oh so flowery. Again, lots of floral and citrus hops up front, with a smooth transition through malty sweetness to a nice bitter hop finish. Amazing to me that they could get this much floral hop flavor into the beer without overwhelming bitterness. Very well balanced flavor.
M: Smooth, medium body, and nicely carbonated.
D: Very drinkable. Dangerously so. Definitely don't pick up much of the high alcohol content. 
I am not generally a fan of IPAs or DIPAs, but this one is so good it's made me reconsider that opinion. 975 characterszeledonia, Feb 16, 2011
4.2/5  rDev -5.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Thanks to spycow for the can!
Canned 12/27/10
Poured into a Heady Topper pint glass. Slightly hazy, orange-brown body with a thick, foamy, white head. Really nice retention on this one with good lacing.
Lots of orange, grapefruit and lemon citrus on the nose. Pine-laden hops with sweet bready malts. Well-rounded with hop bitterness and citrus.
Citrus and malts hit the tongue first, quickly transitioning to hop bitterness throughout. Definitely has the Surly malt profile that you find in a lot of their hoppy brews. Grapefruit pith and clementine. Herbal/grassy citrus on the finish.
Mouthfeel has a good malt backbone, which makes the beer seem balanced at first, but it finishes with a nice wave of hops the brings the bitterness back out front, which I really like. Good body for a double IPA. Somewhat chewy and slightly resiny.
Drinkability is good. This is a well crafted brew and probably my favorite hop forward beer from Surly besides Wet. I could easily do a can of this anytime and the 9% ABV is essentially unnoticeable. Maybe not my favorite hop profile for a DIPA, but I can see why it averages an A rating. Nice work Surly. Here's to hoping your brewery expansion goes through. Cheers! 1,210 characterssisuspeed, Feb 16, 2011
4.08/5  rDev -8.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Can date is Dec. 27th, 2010. Poured into a pint glass, revealing hazy amber body with a massively tall and thick head. Nice lacing. Smells nice and meaty with hops along with a slight citrus presence and some bitter rind. Standard DIPA smells.
Tastes nice and bitter but with a serious malt backbone. Meaty, almost unctuous hop presence with a slight bitter grapefruit rind character and a little floral honey all over a burnt caramel malt body. Mouthfeel is thick and almost shake-like for a DIPA with creamy yet tingly carbonation which adds to the medium body. Very drinkable, very rich. Drinks like half a meal.
I wish this brew were around these parts. I would certainly reach for more of it. 699 charactersabuliarose, Feb 16, 2011
4.23/5  rDev -5.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4A - Looks like an IPA is supposed to. Slightly hazy golden orange/light brown with a big 'ol two finger head that lasts and puts nice lacing down the glass. A little carbonation can be seen flowing in the glass also.
S - Just a little faint for my liking for a DIPA, but incredibly pleasing nonetheless. Fresh wet citrus hops come through the olfactory right from the beginning and linger long after the first whiff.
T - A little different than the aroma (the hop profile shifts a little) but still very tasty. The bittering of the Warrior hops definitely comes through from start to finish, and the tag-team combo with the Citra hops leaves a pleasant fruity aftertaste. The malt flavor is way back there in the taste but provides enough of a backbone to make a nice ratio of bitterness to sweetness for the style.
M/D - Medium body with a light syrup-like texture on the palate. A little undercarbed for my personal liking, but to each their own. Great hop profile make it very easy to drink but not too complex that the glass is finished before figuring out what this beer is all about.
My first beer from Surly and I must get more! 1,139 charactersVaTechHopHead, Feb 15, 2011
4.32/5  rDev -3.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4From notes - Amazing golden orange color that highlights tiney bubbles that rush towards a puffy white two finger head. This head leaves some spotty lacing as the beer retreats. The aroma is madening, both citrusy orange, lemon, grapefruit and tropical fruits ride a wave of more earthy and piney hops underneath. The flavor is crisp and clean, tropical, citrusy, and sweet withough being cloying. Perfect grain bill, too much crystal sometimes kills an ipa, here it is great, muted yeast charecter, clean. Is it the oat? Chewy and full mouthfeel just shy of too much. This is one of my top three favorit x2ipa's period. 620 characterspmlondrigan, Feb 15, 2011
4.3/5  rDev -3.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Big thanks goes out to optimator13 for this one from the Small Aquatic Mammal BIF '11! Served from can into a Surly Darkness snifter. Poured yellow-orange with a two and a half finger off-white head that subsided to a one finger very slowly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, citrus, grapefruit, citrus hop, bitter hop, and slight wild onion. The flavor was of sweet malt, citrus, citrus hop, garlic, and mild onion. It had a medium feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this brew was quite excellent. The onion flavor I detected on this one reminded me of all the good memories I have of Gunba. There was an excellent aroma and well balanced hoppy bitterness going on in this one. This is an absolute must try and totally worth seeking out. 808 charactersthagr81us, Feb 14, 2011
4.82/5  rDev +8.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Abrasive. How can something with a name like that be so, so, smooth?
This is possibly the perfect beer. 
Not even my favorite style, but Abrasive has taken the DIPA and imparted a smooth, buttery, slightly floral, slightly citrus feast for your senses. Great balance, terrific mouthfeel, and dangerously drinkable. This has a crispness that comes from somewhere deep inside the water - not from a hop bitterness that other brewers rely on. It has a candy finish like the last lick of a stick of rock candy from your favorite amusement park. It has an almost chewy mouthfeel that is a combination of the higher ABV and a melting marhsmallow straight from the fire, that is just browned, not burned.
I am actually glad this is seasonal, because it might just be the end of me if I could find it year-round for a reasonable fee. 828 characterstmcelvain, Feb 14, 2011

A: Poured a tangerine golden with a half-finger steady cream head that leaves a little lacing.
S: This smells good. Pineapple and apple juice, a little banana, slightly cheesy, mild orange citrus, slightly floral and yeasty with an almost craisin character, slightly gin or vodka alcohol, wow. This reminds me a lot of Columbus IPA but more in-your-face.
T: Again, a very strong fruit character, fresh pear being in the forefront, but there is an orange juice and pineapple green (slightly cheesy) hops. The alcohol is pretty well masked until the finish, where it lingers like gin. This is good. Again, the overall impression is that of Columbus IPA. They must use similar hops profiles.
M: Nice. Frothy, a little creamy and thick, but cleansing on the finish.
D: Very good.
I can see why this gets such good reviews. This might be one of my new favorite DIPAs. 950 charactersne0m00re, Feb 13, 2011

A: pours a copper brown with a 1 finger creamy white head with moderate retention. nice lacing.
S: grapefruit citrus, hoppy and resiny. similar to knuckle sandwich, one of my favorite DIPAs.
T: not very hoppy, malt forward with citrus accents, caramel and bitter on the end. 
M: very smooth, moderate carbonation helps accent the flavors.
D: very drinkable, this beer hides it's ABV very well. smooth without much hoppy bite, could drink a few of these before realizing it's potency.
O: really like this beer. It reminds me of knuckle sandwich and double jack; more malt than hops, but in a good way. 768 charactersroodie, Feb 12, 2011

A: Orange golden hue. Pours about a 1 finger, bubbly, off-white head. Plenty of carbonation. Settles pretty slowly. Eventually leaves just a light blanket of bubbly carbonation on the surface. Some really nice spiderweb lacing.
S: Hoppy, piny, and some sweet citrus tones. Maybe some raisin and licorice in there too. Clove and oregano.
T: Raisin, pine, baked bread. Nice bittersweet kind of thing going on.
M: Puckering-ly pinyness introduces itself in the front and lingers throughout. Also, that slight sweetness starts, but is overcome a little by the pine. Very dry finish. Really carbonated.
D: Sip and enjoy.
Atmosphere is very good. Really nice deep golden hue, bubbly head, carbonation throughout and some decent lacing. Nose is very full combination of pine, sweet and spice. Flavor is an interesting balance of pine, sweet, and spice. Kinda' tastes like it smells. Overall, this is a great quaff. 949 charactersbmwats, Feb 12, 2011

S-the nose is all tropical fruits of apricot and grapefruit with hints of hop resign and a very syrupy aroma. 
T-the taste adds some different flavors. there is still a fair bit of tropical fruits but there are also notes of grain intertwined into the flavor with notes of pine towards the back. an assertive bitterness in the finish that doesn't linger. 
M-the body is pretty big and somewhat syrupy with a slightly grainy palate and strong carbonation with just a touch of driness in the finish. 
D-this is a big IPA with some great hop presence and nice bitterness that ends abruptly. Tasty and drinkable stuff with just a hint of alcohol in the finish. 735 characterscpetrone84, Feb 10, 2011

A: Murky caramel colored. Two fingers of white head. Great retention. Leaves a solid film..good splotchy lacing.
S: Hops are out front(in fact you notice them as soon as you crack open the can), but Abrasive is a little different because the malt doesn't back down and competes for top billing. Citrus, grapefruit bitterness, pine, tropical fruit smells. It's hard to pull my nose out of the glass...this one gets a 5.
T: Everything from the nose. Citrus and grapefruit are probably the most pronounced, but pine comes in to play along with pineaple and mango..and of course the sweetness, breadiness from the malts. There's also a peachy quality to this beer as well. Very balanced, very enjoyable.
M: Creamy, good carbonation. Coats the mouth with a good aftertaste, dry finish. 
D: Abrasive goes down smooth and easy. Alcohol never came into play. A true pleasure to drink.
I like this beer...a lot. Thanks Brian! 992 characterstitosupertramp, Feb 10, 2011

S: Nice pine and floral aromas. Get some tropical fruits, grapefruit and orange mostly. There are some caramel and bready malts too. 
T: Lots of pine up front with a little bit of tropical fruit flavors - grapefruit, orange, and a little bit of lemon. There is some caramel and doughy malt back it up. 
M/D: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Definitely on the creamier side. Left my mouth dry with a slight bitter flavor. Overall, quite drinkable, but I am surprised that it wasn't as hoppy as expected. 726 charactersmdaschaf, Feb 08, 2011
4.84/5  rDev +8.5%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Appearance:
Light coppery. Orange might be the best way to describe it. More or less clear with little head that dissipates fast. Some bubbles... bubbling up.
Aroma: 
Sweetness and hoppy citrus... Grapefruit is the dominant aroma, a giveaway for Citra hops.
Taste: 
Sweet and grapefruity with a balanced bitterness in the back end. The malt flavor is subdued but apparent.
Mouthfeel: 
Carbonated, lightish but with some body. Pleasant and not harsh.
Drinkability:
Very high. I can only curse the ABV and price tag... this is one I could drink for as long as it's available to me. As an IPA, this is superior. 612 charactersevanlarkin, Feb 07, 2011

Thanks to korguy123 for this one. 
Poured in to Duvel tulip. 
A - Medium amber colour with an orange glow throughout. Opaque. One finger of foamy off-white head that left some nice lacing. 
S - Bitter and sweet all in the initial scent, which is rare for a DIPA. Appears to be very balanced. Some citrus notes are present from the hops with a sweet caramel malt backbone to compliment it. 
T - Bitter hops initially hit the tongue, followed by a big caramel-toffee malt sweetness and then the bitterness returns in the finish and lingers on the tongue for a little while. The hops have some citrus notes but they are somewhat difficult to pick out as they are overpowered by sweet caramel malts. Overall, very huge bitterness as well, but not as much flavour from the hops comes through as I would have expected. I really like this beer, but I don't love it. 
M - Medium body, chewy, light to moderate carbonation. 
D - I am surprised how much I like this beer given that I tend to like hop-forward IPAs and this one is definitely malt dominated. Maybe my palate is changing... 1,136 charactersTheSevenDuffs, Feb 05, 2011

This is amazingly the best ever I had.
 Poors a perfection of golden coper color that let me know right that this is serious business. The head retains well a couple of fingers before it laces down the glass in a majestic white and beige web all around.
It is hard to focus on anything else tan the outstanding aromas of grapefruit, citrus,mangos,pine,pineapple mixed of tropical fruits. Medium/light body holds in it's arms a packed stash of hops flavors that will make you cry.
Just amazingly balanced with 9% goes down super smooth and surprisingly easy. Surly got it down for sure. If you enjoy Pliny the elder or green flash imperial IPA, Alpine Nelson, here you going for a treat people, and it's going to teach you a lesson or two.
Cans rock! lesson number one.
West coast IIPA are insanely good, but the east coast has a fare share of loaded barrels. Hop bomb smashed right in my face with this amazing ABRASIVE ALE. Take that and come for more:) 1,042 charactersHipHop5, Feb 04, 2011

Appearance: Abrasive pours a light golden color with copper highlights, with just over a finger of white head. Retention is pretty good, as is the lacing.
Smell: Grapefruit and citrus are present about evenly on the nose, with dank piney hops and some other tropical fruits. Very nice.
Taste: I've had a fair number of the more hyped IPAs/DIPAs at this point, and I've got to say this is my favorite so far. I get grapefruit, citrus, pineapple, mango, as well as those dank hops on the back end and finish. In terms of sheer complexity of hop flavors and citrus character, I'll take this beer. 
Mouthfeel/Drinkability: This beer is in between light and medium bodied, with nice fine carbonation. It is very smooth going down. Probably not quite as good in this category as a couple other that I've tried, but still good. I wish I had access to this beer (and all Surly beers) all the time. I would be most satisfied, because this is a phenomenal beer. 1,082 characterszhanson88, Feb 03, 2011

Can to tulip
App- It's that orange of a basketball. Orange with a tinge of amber to it. A very nice one finger pretty quick to fade head was with it as well.
Smell- A large tropical note with the hops to match. It's a very aromatic can for a month of a age on it. The aromatics are quite pleasant.
Taste- Quite delicious. The flavors are so balanced with a nice fruit flavor and a lit hops spice. It's very well done with touches of mango, pineapple, and orange. Maybe a touch of tangerine.
Mouth- Medium bodied with a medium/high carb level. The after taste leaves a bit of bitter and spice and of course the fruits.
Drink- A hidden gem from MN. Surly does some great brews. very well done with huge flavors across the board. 750 charactersFosterJM, Feb 02, 2011

A: Pours a hazy copper/orange color. At first a two finger white head forms with good retention. Sheets of lace are left down the glass.
S: Big juicy hops dominate. Tangerine, mango, orange. A fruit salad in my nose...Fairly simple, but just excellent.
T: Again, huge juicy flavors explode on the tongue. Orange peal, sweet tangerine and mango flavors. I love the fruity, and juicy hops. A light bitterness lingers, but not over powering at all. I can't say there is a lot of malt for balance, but in this instance all the hop flavors meld perfectly. It is balanced in that it is not mouth puckering bitterness, or harsh alcohol.
M/D: A full body with good carbonation. Very clean and smooth. So easy to drink. There is a bit of heat as this warms up, but a great treat. 
There is nothing abrasive about this at all (unintended pun). A huge juicy hop character along the lines of Masala Mama and the like. Excellent and highly recommended. 984 characterschamp103, Feb 02, 2011

The smell is great! Lemon, tangerine, and slight ginger.
After the smell the taste doesnt disapoint one bit. The front is sweet citrus and tropical fruits and goes down extremely smooth with bitterness and alcohol on the back.
This beer is far too drinkable for the ABV and if it were sold in CA Id drink it all the time. 409 charactersEriktheipaman, Feb 01, 2011
4.4/5  rDev -1.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4A solid pour into my large Tripel Karmeliet tulip produces a three-finger thick, pale tan colored head. The beer is a fairly clear, copper-amber color that does show a touch of haze (hop-haze one would hope). The aroma is awesomely dank with hops; an infused mix of bright citrus, pine, tropical fruit and herbaceous dank bud. The bright tropical fruit character mixes so well with the dank herbal quality that it makes me think of some, as yet undiscovered, cross between a tropical fruit and a really ripe, green marijuana bud. Specific aromas of tangelo zest, essential citrus oil, big lychee, kumquat, super-concentrated floral peach, some sort of citrusy almost garlic like note, peppery pine sap and a dank menthol note; up front the super ripe, tropical fruit character dominates, while in the finish the herbaceous, even at times peppery, notes come to the fore. Over time the garlic chive like aromatic note starts to come more to the fore and a spicy, slightly hot note of alcohol also starts to contribute to the nose.
Not as sweet as I was expecting, if it wasn't for the huge tropical fruit component the flavor might even be somewhat dry. Up front a ripe, tropical fruit note contributes flavors of lychee, kumquat, floral peach nectar and blended tangerine zest juice. Through the middle the hop notes contribute solid menthol notes, herbal, sometimes rosemary like (though not so distinctly), the flavors one gets by chewing on fresh pine needles and flavors reminiscent, though not overwhelmingly so, of garlic chives. The bitterness is not overly aggressive here, but it does linger on the palate after the beer has left. The bitterness is quit clean and crisp in quality; this is a bit surprising given how herbaceous and dank the aroma was, though there is some lingering herbal notes here as well. The tropical fruit character blends with the herbal notes towards the finish to create a flavor that reminds me a bit of fruity onions or perhaps garlic, this character is fairly slight, but definitely noticeable and not all that objectionable. This is quite quaffable as the body on this beer is on the light side from your typical Double IPA (many of which are much too cloying); there is enough texture for this to have some palate clinging viscosity, but the herbal and bitter hop notes do a good job of balancing that out. As the beer warms a bit some hotter, spicier notes of alcohol start to influence the flavor.
I would definitely like to get a fresh off the canning line version of this beer, but this is still quite fresh and vibrantly hoppy. Given that this is at least a month old at this point, it is lasting pretty well in the can; I would guess that it holds up better than Pliny does in its bottle. I am not sure that I like this more than fresh Pliny though, it has a bit too much garlic chive flavor and aroma to it (thought thankfully this is held to a low enough level that I am still thoroughly enjoying this beer). 2,958 charactersGueuzedude, Jan 31, 2011

Incredible! Hops hops hops... Loads of floral and citrus and pine. Grapefruit is probably the strongest scent. Tastes... Like an incdible hop bomb. Tons of citrus and floral and grapefruit! A lot going on. Holy cow! This beer is phenomenal.
Smells soooo fucking good... In fact, i accidentally snorted some...

Glass: Sierra Nevada XXX snifter
Type: 16fl oz can; extra from 'Lenny1203'
Huge thanks to Justin for including this beer as an extra in our trade! Poured easily for a 1.5-finger head that holds true for several minutes, color is clear amber-orange, lacing is super-sticky with very small bubbles....just like most Surly canned beers! Aroma is loaded with fresh pineapple, grapefruit, honey, and a slight sting of pine. Taste of perfectly-balanced malt/hop profiles. Flavors of tropical fruit carry over to the taste. Leaves a fruity-bitterness on the palate between tastes. The pineappley-hops are enormous. This is one of the best IPAs I have ever had. Thank God it's fresh! Thanks Justin! 713 charactersToAzwethinkweizm, Jan 30, 2011
4.6/5  rDev +3.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Picked a few up in a trade with arvjunk. Thanks! The date on the bottom of the can was unfortunately scratched out so I cannot tell how fresh this is. 
Poured from a can into a tulip glass. With an aggressive pour, about a finger and a half of white large bubble head that quickly receded to a collar, leaving a lot of nice lacing on the glass. Beer is dark orange, very hazy so you cannot see through it. When held up to a light, the beer really glows though, and a small cascade of carbonation visible when swirled lightly. 
Nose is a lot of pineapple, with juicy grapefruit. Probably the strongest pineapple aroma I've ever smelled in an IPA. Swirling it lightly brings out some of the bready malts and a bit of wet grass. 
Nice hop bitterness right away on the tongue, pineapple and grapefruit peel. Malt sweetness and the tropical and citrus hops skips right over the tongue, leaving a clean finish. Really nice balance in bitterness and sweetness.
Medium bodied beer with carbonation that gently scrubs your tongue of the sticky sweetness, leaving a lightly bitter lingering citrus and herbal hoppiness. Dangerously drinkable DIPA as the alcohol is very well hidden despite being 9.0%. I had to keep myself from drinking a pint of it up quickly. 1,255 charactersnataku00, Jan 30, 2011

4.2/5  rDev -5.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Thanks to cmswoboda for the opportunity to try this one. Served at 49 degrees in a tulip. Pours a translucent burnt red/orange with a latte-like one inch cap. Head eventually dissipates into a solid skim, with swaths and spots of lacing adhering to the walls of the glass during the tasting. Nose reveals sweet citrus notes and a touch of slightly herbal, bitter rind. Taste consistent with nose; however, some tropical fruit seems to be co-mingled in the flavor profile. Finish is slightly bitter, but does not linger. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with a slightly oily consistency and a crisp, even carbonation. There's also a slight astringency that lightly stimulates the sides of the cheeks. A top notch DIPA with great balance and just the right amount of complexity. I can't get enough from this Brewer. 807 charactersJwale73, Jan 28, 2011
4.57/5  rDev +2.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Nice appearance - bright orange-amber with a big white head.
Wonderful fruity hop smells - orange, pineapple, peach, and pink grapefruit. Like a tropical fruit smoothy. Tough to pick up any malt under all that fruityness. 
Flavor is also dominated by hops - tangerine, pineapple, and grapefruit, although there is a toasty malt background. Alcohol is very well hidden - no indication this is over 7%. Finishes with a lengthy bitterness.
Creamy fullness, oily, carbonation is pretty smooth - a bit more prickly would bring out additional bitterness, but I think they hit what they were aiming for here.
A very smooth, fruity DIPA. Ranks up there with Two Hearted and Furious for me. Delicious. 696 charactersGeezLynn, Jan 27, 2011

Ton of hops up front, carbonation spot on. Tried this by myself and was blown away, tried it with a friend the next go around and we were both amazed. We tried it again for a third time this Saturday next to Pliny (very fresh) and Abrasive was the preference of 3 of the 4 people at the tasting. It is amazing how this beer changes over just a week time with it tasting best the first (freshest). Looking forward to my next try of this amazing beer. 554 charactersjoshuacavett, Jan 24, 2011
4.43/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 16oz can dated 12-29-10. Pours clear dark orange with one finger white head. Aroma was impressive. Loaded with dank hops and tons of citrus. Flavor was loaded with bitter hops, but lacking all the citrus (I'm picking up mostly orange here) and a good malt back bone. Abrasive is a good name for this brew as if you don't like a ton of bitter hops than this one might not be for you. Mild carbonation going on. Solid beer but a bit of a disappointment based on other rankings. 489 charactersCuriousMonk, Jan 24, 2011
4.45/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Can poured into a dogfish pint.
A - Pours deep amber orange with a thick froth of two finger tall white head slowly dissipating down to light sheets of lacing down the entire glass.
S - Quite the hop bomb. Plenty of tropical fruit is mixed in well with the strong citric hops. Some bready yeast and sweet caramel malt help balance things out a bit. The closest example to sculpin I have seen.
T - wow. Tons of tropical fruits mix well with the citric hops up front giving way quickly to a creamy sweetness that lingers throughout the finish. The finish is quite dry after drinking the entire can. I really enjoyed the balance this one had. I would love to try this on-tap someday. Until then I will have to settle for a few more cans. 
M - Medium body and flavor with moderate carbonation. Quite the creamy feel with some lingering dryness long after the finish. I love the balance this one has.
D - Very High. I really enjoyed this one. The balance of hops, sweetness, and creamy feel is nearly flawless. Easily the best IPA I have ever had out of a can. I look forward to having this again in the future. 1,111 charactersorangesol, Jan 23, 2011
4.57/5  rDev +2.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Another free beer from Sideswipe. Thanks man.
Pours a copper color with a thin head. Again dissapointed by the east coast style IPA and head retention. No real lacing.
Aroma is very similar to Pliny. Where you don't get much of any malt aroma. You get the simco piney aroma mixed with the citric hop aroma. Awesome.
Taste is different than the aroma would suggest. Much more balanced with a nice malt backbone. Slightly sweet with hop resin coating your tongue.
Mouthfeel is great. Nice carb and nice malt.
Overall I would say this beer is better than Hopslam but not better than Heady topper or elder/younger or sculpin. This is an awesome IPA that I will be trading for more. 682 charactersPeprSprYoFace, Jan 22, 2011
4.38/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 16 oz. can into a tulip. Thanks to busch03 for hooking this up.
Appearance: Out of the can this pours a fairly transparent caramel tangerine color. A huge off-white head practically overflows the tulip, leaving gorgeous lacing on the glass.
Smell: A well constructed DIPA is always bursting with hop aroma, and Abrasive is no different. A smooth blend of tropical fruits - I get pineapple and a bit of mango, with softer grapefruit and tangerine as well. The sweetness present is more caramel than candied fruit in nature.
Taste: As I gathered from the appearance, the front is caramel malt with some sweetness that balances the soon-to-come hops. Even with a valiant effort, there is no chance the malt holds up. The first few sips are not overwhelming, but as the glass goes on, the hops really dig in. Pineapple, grapefruit, orange zest, tangerine, mango, and a touch of pine are present in that order of dominance.
Mouthfeel: This drinks extremely light. Abrasive is not abrasive, it drinks extremely smooth. The tongue eventually becomes withered with the paint-stripping hop goodness, but I enjoy that. 
Drinkability: There is no doubt that I could drink this all night, even though my tongue might not have taste buds by morning. This is an appropriate step up from Furious, which to date is my favorite IPA. There is potential for improvement, but this is a solid offering. 1,400 charactersKickInTheChalice, Jan 21, 2011
3.92/5  rDev -12.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3Lucky to have this as it isn't distributed in Ohio. Thanks Paul.
A - Hazy golden, slightly orange color. Head is full, light tan and laces the glass in a very thin consistent sheet.
S - Smell is pine AND citrus. Usually I get one or the other in IPA's. Pine is more dominant. Fruity esters follow.
T - Hops smack you in the face. Oranges are the dominant fruit characteristic I get. Bread-like malts that are in an uphill battle against the hops. The hop finish is more pungent than bitter. Must be a lot of simcoe mixed in there.
M - Smooth creamy texture. Carbonation is medium. 
D - I'm guessing 10% ABV on this baby. More of a sipper but you might find it going down pretty quick.
Overall it is a great double IPA. To be honest, I'd rather be drinking a Furious. I think it is more balanced and more enjoyable. I'm sure others might disagree. 852 charactersGregBlatz, Jan 21, 2011

A:Poured a amber orange color with a fat white with very good lacing left hanging around on the glass
S:Big dose of tropical, citrus, and grapefruit hops come thru right up front. A mild malt sweetnes is hanging around in there as well
T:Just like the nose hops up front followed by some sweetness in the middle, the bcakend is then dominated by citrus and tropical hops that linger around. Very tasty and impresive.
M:Excellent body and carbonation on this one, hop resing is all over the palate and the lips with almost no hint of alcohol
D:The drink on this was ridiculous for 9%. Big hop flavors with easy drink which you really couldn't ask for more out of this drink. Could drink this one all the time and would if it was available, lets start some outside distributing Surly!! 818 charactersSuperNova777, Jan 20, 2011

Poured into my delerium tremens chalice while watching The Big Lebowksi. 
A - Just slightly hazy honey amber color. Great white head. 
S - A real treat. Hops explode into my nostrils, flowers, citrus, malt in the backround, grapefruit... DAMN. This smell is either the best or tied with my favorite smells coming from a DIPA. Absolutely huge. 
T - Marvelous hoppy bitterness. Perfectly balanced by a big malt backbone which is almost able to stick up to the hops. I just don't know how you'd craft a brew any better than this. 
M - Glorious. Full bodied IPA, hop f'in wonderland. A true playground of hops. Bitterness lasts on the taste buds and nostrils. 
D - It's printed in the bottle a ton of malts and hops were used. I believe it. They must have used a ton of malt to keep up with all those hops. I've never drank 16 oz of a 9 percent DIPA so fast. I LOVE SURLY. 931 charactersDNICE555, Jan 20, 2011
4.38/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Can poured into my town hall imperial pint.
A clear, bright, orange-tinted gold body sits proudly-- wearing a 2 finger head that is about 3 shades away from being perfect white. Very nice lacing and retention. Huge chunks flow like slow icebergs from the original rings that were formed.
Smells vibrant and fresh-- huge grapefruit notes are at the forefront, with pineapplse and mandarin oranges filling out the bouquet. Very light malt-- and it works quite well.
The taste falls right in line-- a dry, slightly bready malt starts things off with big citrusy hops in the flavor as well. Grapefruit and oranges are HUGE... Pineapple is happy to play a supporting role. Solid amount of bitterness... Delicious. Very impressive.
The body is bright and prickly. Good carbonation, nice oily feel on the finish. Mmmm. This is a solid DIPA.
For 9%, this drinks waaay too easy. I could enjoy this all night. 903 charactersAleWatcher, Jan 19, 2011

This beer was canned on 12/27/10, so actually only a few weeks old.
A - Pours a rather muddy blend between amber and goldenrod, hazy and cloudy, carefully obscuring the contents within. Above the beer rests a bubbly, 2.5-fingered head that reduces to a runny cap in minutes, leaving behind some dense lacing. Unable to garner much sight of carbonation through the beer.
S - The smell of this beer is simply fantastic. The closest thing I've gotten to to Pliny in a long while, it smells of fresh rain, ripe pine, and juicy citrus all rolled up. It's bitter without offending, but is also incredibly refreshing. If I could travel to a spot where this smell could experienced every day in nature, I'd pack my bags in a heartbeat. It's that good.
T - And after my first sip, I'm actually a little disappointed, yet not quite surprised it doesn't live up perfectly to the nose. It certainly has roots in a West Coast styled IPA, being unbalanced in favor of showcasing the hops, and it does a great job of that. It's extremely bitter, but is in check a bit by the grapefruit and orange and the slightest bit of malt backbone. I'm constantly being reminded of Pliny here, but Pliny just seems to squeeze out more flavor besides bitter and citrus and thus I feel a bit let down here. It's not bad by any means, and as I drink the bitterness does cut substantially, but I just wish it was a bit more after the awesome nose.
M - Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderately low carbonation. It's resiny and sticky and leaves a thick coating on the palate. Finish is long and bitter.
D - Drinkability is high. The alcohol is masked nicely and the nose and flavor just have me constantly coming back for me. It's smooth as well, which really helps. I need to find myself a 4-pack of this! 1,870 charactersnhindian, Jan 18, 2011

S - Great aroma. Grapefruit, other tropical fruits, bubblegum and pine. There was a mild caramel aroma, too.
T - This is was an Imperial IPA should taste like. Bitter, spicy hops with fruity kicks of grapefruit and orange. Some pine. Burnt toast maltiness.
M - It was crisp, sharp and finished dry. A medium bodied beer that hides it alcohol content.
D - This is delicious. Worth the price in every way. 563 characterszeff80, Jan 17, 2011

Abrasive cracks with a hiss and pours into the Founders pint glass looking bright bronze with a deep orange color all around. A nice amount of foam up above that settles into a nice cap, rings around the glass. Smell is hop forward and malty in the back. A big blast of citrus, mango, pineapple, the works with oranges, a lot of those. A bready sweet biscuit as well. Taste is superb, really gets the essence of west coast hop bombs. To me though, this mostly reminds me of a lot of Port Brewing hoppy offerings. A whole bunch of orange and mango flavor in here backed by some sweet bready type yeast and light malts. Other tropics after that. Im really liking the feel here, it kinda tears through a layer of my mouth on the first few sips, than eases up with a mix of hops than light malt. Carb is great out da can, a medium body. I could not get down big gulps of this stuff for some reason. I usually tear through DIPA's, I had to take a laid back approach to this one. A top notch DIPA that gets that west coast loving. 1,067 charactersBARFLYB, Jan 17, 2011

Smell: Tropical fruit. Pineapples. Hints of citrus, orange and grapefruit rind. Herbal notes as well and faint toasty malt presence.
Taste: Spectacular display of hop flavors running the gamet from grapefruit rind citrus orange, tropical pineapple, herbal mint, grassy hay and then the bitterness hits, wonderful. After getting acquainted with the hop's bite, the toasted malt backbone provides a subtle sweetness that settles in nicely.
Mouthfeel: Medium, slightly creamy, mildly carbonated.
Drinkability: Powerful stuff. Delicious. I didn't get any sense of the 9% ABV, but the sheer cornucopia bounty of the flavorful hop profile should, should, limit me to one pint a night. Well done. 822 charactersJackieTH, Jan 16, 2011

16oz bottle poured into a New Belgium globe.
A: Slightly hazy golden/orange, foamy two finger white head. Good retention, lacing sticks like glue. 
S: Very tropical. Lots of mango, peach, apricot, mandarin orange, and some pineapple. Bitter grapefruit and pine. Very sweet malt base creates aromas of sugary caramel. Somewhat doughy as well. 
T: Bitter grapefruit opens, followed by very juicy and vibrant flavors of mango and apricot. A strong pine taste and some mint follow this, then fade into the background as tropical tastes or orange and pineapple emerge. Malt base is very sweet (crystal malt?) and doughy. Finishes dry with some grapefruit bitterness, 
M: Medium bodied and slightly silky/creamy. Some alcoholic warmth.
D: Good. 
Notes: Very good. Certainly up there with some of the better DIPAs I've had. Apparently this is brewed with oats. That explains the great head retention and mildly silky mouthfeel. 1,001 charactersryan1788a5, Jan 15, 2011

4.45/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Big thanks to Kegatron for this brew. What a guy...thank you Heath for the random surprise! Canned on 12/27/10 and poured into a snifter. This brew appears fairly clear with an orange coloration and some small particulate sinks to the bottom of the glass. A little more than a finger of fluffy yellowish stained head forms and holds strong in the glass. As it recedes, it leaves patches of lace clinging to the glass.
This a very pleasant smelling brew displaying a ton of fruity indications. A scent of pineapple primarily with some hints of orange and grapefruit that is somewhat rind-like and zesty. A bit of an herbal touch that is lightly minty and spicy. As the brew warms, it picks up some toasted malt character. I am quite surprised that no matter how warm I let this brew get, I never really picked up on any of the 9% abv.
This brew includes a vast array of hop flavoring before it turns bitter. Flavors of citrus rind like orange meets some herbal quality that is somewhat minty and spicy. Once the bitterness settles in, it clings inside the mouth with an herbal quality that is balanced well over top of a toasted malt flavor that provides a light amount of sweetness. Once warm, a bit of grassy flavor mixes with the herbal quality that lasts inside the mouth.
This is a medium bodied brew with a moderate amount of carbonation. This is a very solid brew that I really enjoyed. It is well balanced, smells wonderful and easy drinking, very easy drinking for 9%. I love a good hoppy beer that encompasses an array of flavor without displaying just sheer bitterness. Well done Surly and big big thanks Heath for sharing this with me. 1,649 charactersstakem, Jan 15, 2011

Pours a nice dark honey color, with light sunny touches around the edges. A two-finger fluffy off-white head adorns, sticks around, and coats the glass in spongy lacing.
Aroma is heaps of floral hops, tons of citrus fruits, backing malt sweetness, bitterness, and oily, pungent pine notes.
Stark bitterness hits you, moves to bold citrus fruits (orange, grapefruit), piny and flowery, earthy and sweet. Malts jump in and out, along with touches of caramel and honey. 
Creamy texture with a bit of nice sharp carbonation and a solid lower-medium body. 
Dangerously drinkable DIPA, simple as that. 636 charactersEgadBananas, Jan 14, 2011

A- two big fingers of off white head that rises above the glass and holds for a good bit but settles after the first sip to leave a ton of sticky lace and a thin skin on top. A beautiful bronze orange in color with just the faintest haze. 
S- a ton of tropical and citrus fruits up front with mango, tangerine, pineapple, oranges. Just a light honey simple syrup sweetness. 
T- A back and forth between bold citrusy hops and aggressive bitter piney hops. neither overpowering the other for more then a second. Lots more grapefruit then the nose led on to and the tropical fruits follow. Malts come off with a toasty bread and caramel sweetness that does add a nice balance and round it all out nicely. 
M- just about medium in body maybe a tick on the higher side with a carb that builds to just the right clip and works perfectly to elevate the brew where you want it to be. Slightly dry finish. 
D- well god damn this is a killer beer. Hands down one of the best dipas I've ever had. This fillie can run with the best of em and maybe take the whole thing. The name fits, it is abrasive and it will settle the hop fiend in you but so nicely balanced that you can enjoy a few for sure. 1,278 charactersoglmcdgl, Jan 14, 2011

4.52/5  rDev +1.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Thanks to Joshuaseresse for this excellent extra.
The can pours clear, golden orange, producing a finger of white head. This slowly settles to a thin cap of lacing.
As soon as I opened the can, I was hit with potent hops. Citrus, pine, and floral notes are all there in roughly equal measure, backed by just a hint of caramel malts. This just smells great.
Like the smell, the flavor is all about the hops. It begins with massive citrus and pine, then eventually reveals a little bit of sweet, bready malts. A lasting bitterness is left on the tongue.
Medium bodied and a bit sticky, this beer is very pleasant to drink.
The good flavor balance and complete lack of detectable alcohol make for a ridiculously drinkable DIPA. 729 charactersPellinore1, Jan 13, 2011
4.72/5  rDev +5.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5A top tier Double IPA.
A: Orange hued brew with great ring of white head and some nice sticky lacing.
S: Tons of grapefruit and bitter pine needles, and I mean lots of fresh pine. Citrus. Nice sweet bready malts, but this is really all about the hops.
T: Lesser hops, pine and citrus than the aroma but yeah it's definitely still there. Aggressive spicy malt, and some sweetness at the back of the palate. A semi dry yet still succulent finish. Very nice.
M: Nice carbonation and nice feel overall. 
D: Awesome stuff. I love this beer. 540 charactersDreadnaught33, Jan 12, 2011
4.47/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Bottle shared with cmurren25, Jwiss22, JayW73 and Lane23 at a little tasting have been wanting this one since I missed it last year here goes...
A- A spectacular slightly hazy golden color with a bright yellow hue. Has a nice amount of carb with a light stream of bubbles leading up to a thick, bright white, fluffy and sticky head. Looks amazing, I'm ready to dive right into this one. 
S- Abrasive? Damn straight an onslaught of grapefruit, pine, citrus and aromatic floral hops. I love it. It's like a fresh harvest ale. It has a ridiculous amount of hops in the nose almost like a battle royal of the who's how of hops. Simply mind bending and amazing.
T- An attack of the senses! Fresh citrus, grapefruit, tangerine, succulent and juicy fruits, tropical fruits and the like. It's amazing it's just an attack of hops and even a little warming and they just won't leave. I have been assaulted by hops and I feel dirty, used and abused, but I love it. By the way, where the hell is the caramel malty sweetness? It's almost nonexistent, it's just a balance of crazy hops. My slight knock would be maybe a touch more sweetness or bitterness. 
M- Big, sticky, and coating. Like pine tar. It sticks to everything and just won't leave. A little tiny tickle of carb, but just an in your face hop stickiness that is rarely experienced. Thank you finally a fresh can of this.
D- Hahaha, you bet your ass it is. High abv? Do you really give a shit, your drinking beer? After I awoke from my hop coma and the land of hops. I have realized that sometimes I wish I lived in Minnesota so I could have this every winter. It's unbelievably sticky, refreshing and the smooth balance is second to none. Who cares about the abv, I need more of this and wish it was brewed year round. It would be an awesome beer to go fishing with. Thank you Surly!
I really have no witty commentary to finish this one up with just a big THANK YOU to Surly. For Christ's sake come to PA, or just distribute to my house like once a month please. 2,017 charactersStormKing47, Jan 12, 2011
4.57/5  rDev +2.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 516 oz can into a tulip glass. Canned on 12/27/10. Huge thanks to joshuaseresse for hooking me up with some of these. You da' man Josh! 
Pours a slightly hazed golden copper, with 2 robust fingers of off-white frothy head. This retains with a thin creamy film that flares up to a rich ½ finger and throws a foamy cascade of lacing that hangs in spotty swathes down the sides of the glass. The aroma is floral and spicy, with a vibrant smelling blend of grapefruit, pine, and citrus peel, which cuts across the nostrils like a knife. This flavorful sharpness is tempered by notes of juicy tropical sweetness and malty notes of sticky caramel and fresh biscuits. This is just so fresh and forceful in the nose. Awesome! 
The taste is so well balanced here, with hops that prickle the tongue with grapefruit, resins, and earthy rind but are far from overly bitter, thanks to a wave of balancing force from notes of juicy fruit, caramel, and bread, which drench the back of the palate with a ripe sticky sweetness. This sweetness carries over to the finish a bit and keeps it from being harsh, as there is a fair amount of trailing grapefruit pith and dry pine that lingers. The mouthfeel is fuller bodied, with a soft creaminess and oiliness to the feel that keeps this surprisingly gentle in the mouth despite the overall heftiness here. There is still some sharpness present though, which helps accentuate those full hop flavors. Holy shit, is that 9% ABV just beautifully hid here or what? Not one speck of alcohol is picked up anywhere in this beyond the overall size of the body. Just fantastic! 
I originally had a growler of this (as 16 Grit) almost exactly 2 years ago and finding me back with this beer was like reuniting with an old friend. Wow, is this DIPA full flavored, well balanced, and deceptively drinkable for the size. I honestly think that I enjoyed this even more the second time around with it. There are a LOT of fantastic examples of the style out there right now but this one definitely stands tall. It's definitely the best example of a DIPA in a can anyway! 2,085 charactersKegatron, Jan 11, 2011

a - light clear golden color. white head. would like to see a little more color.
s - smells amazing. sweet pine hops. exactly like a DIPA should smell.
t - huh. very large hops bitterness. nice sweetness. but it has a creaminess in the body, which is odd at first. its an amazing flavor, and even more incredible how much the malt backbone comes through. the grapefruit fruitiness comes up pretty strong as well.
m - like I said, its quite creamy. medium body and typical carbonation. bitterness leaves a dry finish.
overall - very tasty. this would be a fun one to age and see what happens. I feel the 9%, but don't taste it. very drinkable. 708 characterslevifunk, Jan 11, 2011
4.77/5  rDev +7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I had 16 Grit on cask a few years back, had Abrasive canned last year and loved it. Finally reviewing it.
Canned 12/27/10
A - Pours a bright gold, somewhat hazy with a thick off white head. Head disappears quickly Fairly sticky on the glass.
S - So many hops I don't know where to start. It's like there's a fight between fruity grapefruit and floral hops. Just comes thru as a bag of freshly opened bag of hops
T - A huge burst of fresh fruit, citrus and grapefruit up front then sweetness. In the back its very sweet. The hops really try to balance this out but with little effect. I bet this would be great after a year when the hops fade and the huge malt come forward. The only flaw is that this is very sweet and there's almost no bitterness
M - That classic canned rich full body that you get from Surly. 
D - You must be joking with how easy this one can go down! 9% no way...you get no hint of alcohol here, no malt or hop dominance just great balance
This is just too good of a beer to not seek out! Way too drinkable and I'm only upset that I can't get more. The only flaw (if you can call it that) is that its very sweet. Though, the description says it's 'under-brewed' so I'm sure that's what they were going for. 1,233 charactersboomer31, Jan 11, 2011
4.74/5  rDev +6.3%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5This is one of the best DIPAs I've ever had, hands-down. The appearance is nothing amazing, a cloudy reddish-gold with a minimal head, but every other aspect of this beer is sensational. The smell is all pineapple, smells about as enticing as any beer I've had. Following up the smell, the taste does not disappoint: it's slightly sweet, citrus and fresh hops with a very minor malt base, in my opinion the perfect balance of flavor for a DIPA. The mouthfeel is a little on the thin side, but the lightness suits the beer very well and adds to its drinkability. It has that stickiness that I associate with fresh hops, though I have no idea what to actually attribute it to. It's insanely drinkable for a beer this hoppy and high in ABV. Despite the massive hops flavor, it's really not that bitter. Because of the light mouthfeel and incredible taste, I could drink several of these.
This beer most definitely deserves the reputation it has as one of the best DIPAs out there. It's of the west coast style, which supplements the hoppiness with citrus instead of malt, and it's done to perfection. I want to move to Minnesota so I can load up on it every winter. 1,163 charactersstarrdogg, Jan 09, 2011
4.32/5  rDev -3.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Canned 12/20/10, poured consumed and reviewed 1/7/11. Review transcribed 1/8/11.
A: Full pint pours deep reddish orange with moderate head approximately 1" that slowly dissipates leaving very little lacing.
S: Extreme citrus dominated the nose... more so grapefruit than other citrus fruits. There is also a notable hoppy note to the aroma.
T: Again, hops and citrus pack the walloping punch in front. There is a nice pine taste in the back. It doesn't taste Abrasive at all. Flavors are extremely well balanced.
M: Not a ton of carbonation in this beer. The beer definitely hits all taste buds within the mouth. Has a nice light, refreshing feel to it.
D: For a double IPA, this drinks extremely well. The alcohol is almost undetected making it very easy to drink.
Comments: Very thrilled to have a fresh Abrasive. My next step is to do a side by side with a Furious to note the major differences. 904 characterscirclenine, Jan 08, 2011

Pours a clear golden copper with some darker hues. A lighter off-white head fades out to some wispy film with rings of lacing and streaks along the glass. 
An absolutely delicious hop aroma with piny resin and grapefruit notes coupled with some light malted bready sweetness. 
Begins with a wave of intense hops followed immediately with sticky pine and an explosion of juicy grapefruit. The malt backbone is just right, with touches of bread and somewhat sweet caramel. Finishes with another pleasant smash of exceptionally juicy hops and barely any alcohol heat. 
Nice medium body, decent carbonation, a little sticky and dry in the feel. Drinks great for a DIPA, and the alcohol is nearly undetectable. Excellent job by Surly once again. 868 charactersxnicknj, Jan 08, 2011

Served into a Stone Brewing pint glass
A: pours dark orange, not completely clear, slight haze. A very thick off white head appears with little help from my aggressive pour, and hugs the glass upon drinking. Very pretty.
S: Holy moly, I haven't smelled a beer like this since Alpine Nelson. Smelled it when I opened, and when I poured it into the glass. The entire three foot radius around me was perfumed of hops. Oranges, mangoes, grapefruit, and sticky pine fill my nose. I really can't smell any malt, really.
T: Palate-peeling hops attack my tongue, and the bitter prickle lasts long after the swallow. Being a DIPA, the malt is definitely apparent in this beer, but it's pale enough to not interfere with hop goodness. Amazingly, the fruit shines through in the taste too, unlike a lot of DIPAs, where the citrus can only be found in the nose. There is a sliiight tinge of alcohol, but it's welcome in a beer with so much going on in the flavor.
F: Slightly above medium. Still pretty chewy, and I like that in a big imperial IPA. Coats the entirety of my mouth and leaves a pleasing spike of hop prickle on the sides and back of the tongue.
D: I'm glad I got a 4 pack. I would definitely drink two of these (no driving!) with little problem, but then I wouldn't be able to taste anything for the rest of the night.
Edit: After consideration, and trying Hopslam, I'm bumping my ratings for this beer. It's the best DIPA I've ever had. 1,604 charactersawalk1227, Jan 08, 2011
4.5/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a hazy, yet clean orange-gold, with a tall tannish-white head that hangs out. Provides a fantastic floral, citrus hop flavor. This beer really invites you in. Spicy, biting combination of big hop with a bit of malt back flavor. Surly Wet was like a cleaner, brighter Furious. This is like a bigger, bolder and spicier Furious, in a great way. Leaves a reasonable bitterness behind, but in a pleasant way - like Abrasive Ale doesn't want to let you go. Moderate levels of carbonation without any syrupy mouthfeel that sometimes accompanies bigger DIPAs. Exceedingly drinkable for its aggressive nature. Another winner for Surly. Do yourself a favor and get a connect for Wet, Abrasive and Furious, all right when they come out. At least for the first two, the experience is just as good as Pliny/Blind Pig, just different takes on the styles. That is really a fantastic beer.
Review Edited, +.5 to smell, +.5 to mouthfeel. 928 charactersseeswo, Jan 07, 2011
4.92/5  rDev +10.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Comes in 1 pint cans. 
A - very amber, mostly transparent through the glass. Robust head, small cell that hangs on for quite some time. 
S - profound and pleasing aroma. Smells of grapefruit, cedar, mild hops, oaty. The smell is unexpected as this is my first Abrasive. It was again profound but warm and welcome.
T - smooth but it is named correctly, abrasive. Don't get me wrong, this is good - the name is apropos to this particular beer. Taste maybe of grapefruit and/or peach. Nice taste of an ale but exceptional for a craft beer.
M - abrasive ale! Swirling like effect and the aftertaste is as good as the taste.
D - cannot drink this one fast at all. Very much a beer to be enjoyed over a while. 
I waited a while for this beer and it was well with it. Well done Surly! 783 charactersMinnesotaRIS, Jan 07, 2011

S: Very hop forward, less malt then some DIPA's I've had lately. 
T: Wow, great bitter hop starts this beer out. Tastes of grapefruit and pine as well, with pine being the dominant taste at the end.
M: Nice, not too light and slightly sticky.
D: Refreshing and a very solid beer. I could drink quite a bit of this. 379 charactersCaseyK, Jan 06, 2011
4.58/5  rDev +2.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks Cory for sharing some of this delicious beer.
A- Dark amber color, Surly makes some of the darkest IPA's I've seen, nice frothy 2-3 finger head that died to a frothy ring and light layer on top of the beer.
S- Nice strong piney hops with generous amounts of caramel malts, nice citrus and slight mango scents, typical DIPA scents.
T- Wow is this good... Piney hop bitterness attacks your tounge followed by a nice malty balance and finishes with a nice lemon zest and mango taste in my mouth, really good and up there with Pliny in the taste department.
M- Great carbonation with medium body and the carbonation is smooth with just enough palate cleansing on my tounge.
D- Could easily put down a couple of four packs in one sitting, ridiculously easy to drink. When this is fresh, as it is, it is easily as good as Pliny... Enjoy if you are lucky enough to find this beer. 885 charactersSchmaltzy, Jan 05, 2011

A nice amber orange with a small head. The smell is transcendent. Such a ripe, juicy aroma of tropical fruits and pine. Splendid. The taste is the nectar of amazing citrus and tropical fruit hops. Almost like Hi-C Ecto Cooler (in a good way). So delicious and smooth, a bit of malt to hold it together, but not much. The mouthfeel is good. The drinkability is out of this world. So easy to just down this shit like its a fruit juice cocktail on a beach. A world class DIPA. Amazing. 582 characterssacrelicio, Jan 05, 2011
4.72/5  rDev +5.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Much thanks to UMNBeerHunter for providing this one so fresh, just two weeks after the release!
Pours a golden amber color with a just off white head that fades to a thin layer leaving just a bit of lacing on the sides of the glass.
The aroma is absolutely amazing. A potent mix of pine and citrus hops, but there is a noticeable malt sweetness in the background as well. I don't think I've ever smelled a DIPA like this before.
The taste follows suit, it's plenty bitter with some pine resin and citrus flavors, but it's balanced by an almost honey-like sweetness.
Mouthfeel is on the heavy side of medium but it's nice and sticky with some moderate carbonation. Waaaay too drinkable... literally... I am enjoying this way too much and I'm down to my last couple of sips... I'll definitely track this one down again next time it's out. 840 characters321jeff, Jan 05, 2011
4.89/5  rDev +9.6%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5This beer pours an orange-red color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes slowly into a firm quarter inch cap of lacing. The aroma is strong enough that it leaps out of the glass, and can be detected feet away. Mandarin oranges, peaches, grapefruit, hibiscus, and pollen are all present in copious amounts. This is one beautiful smelling beer. The taste is pure hop juice. The bitterness isn't as firm as a lot of other DIPAs I've tasted which allows the hop flavors to show themselves more clearly. All aspects of the aroma are present in the taste with the addition of a nice soft earthiness in the finish. The mouthfeel is full bodied with moderate carbonation, and a velvety texture. Overall, this is a great beer that I will surely search out again, and again. 772 charactersKarlHungus, Jan 04, 2011

4.47/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.516 oz. can poured into tulip glass.
Appearance-Deep gold to medium amber in color. Mostly clear. Moderate off-white head with decent retention.
Aroma-Holy hops! Mostly pine, some resin, some citrus (lemon and grapefruit), and some grassy notes. Light bready caramel malt aromas apparent as well.
Flavor-Lots of hop flavor, but a sturdy malt backbone to balance. Hop flavors are similar to nose, with plenty of pine, citrus, grass, and resin. Moderate sweet caramel malt and toasty malt, though flavor is seriously hop dominated. Hop bitterness is high, but not harsh. Finish is moderately dry with residual hop flavors of pine and grapefruit, and a healthy dose of hop bitterness. 
Mouthfeel-Medium full body, medium high carbonation. For something this insanely hoppy, the mouthfeel is smooth-never astringent or harsh. Also, for 9% abv, you can barely even sense alcohol warmth as the bitterness is slightly tongue numbing.
This is a well made beer. Anyone can throw a shit-ton of hops into a brew kettle, but it takes true skill to craft a beer that is this hoppy, and yet still so drinkable. Truly delicious. 1,117 charactersplfahey, Jan 03, 2011
4.77/5  rDev +7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Poured from a can into a pint glass with a one finger head...
A- Light amber color with a little lacing. What you would expect of a double IPA.
S- Tropical fruits, pineapple, grapefruit, lots of citrus aroma, a little pine. As strong as this beer is, the alcohol is not that up front, and relatively unnoticeable 
T- Flavor explosion! Very fruity, again pineapple comes to mind. the piney and citrusy hops work extremely well together, and although the hops are the star in this beer, its hard not to notice the malty flavor underlying. I think its the hops to malt ratio that makes this Imperial IPA so special. It finishes with a nice fruity bitterness that keeps going.
M- Light carbonation, just the way I like an IPA. The way the carbonation hits your tongue almost adds another element to the flavor, sort of tangy.
D- Give me more NOW... I am a huge IPA fan and have had many, but until now I haven't tried a double IPA that is this drinkable. With an IBU of 120 you would think otherwise, but its something about that Hops to malt balance.
This is Definitely my favorite Double IPA. 1,098 charactersFlipadelphia84, Jan 03, 2011

4.42/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to chewy08rx for sending this extra can from my want list. 
The beer pours a yellow color with a white head. The aroma screams Double IPA. I get a ton of resiny and pine hops, as well as some orange citrus and something that resembles cat piss - but in a very good way. Definitely a funky, hoppy DIPA.
The flavor is similar and just as good. I get a lot of orange citrus hop notes as well as some pine notes. The flavor is not quite as dank as the aroma, but it is still a ridiculous hop bomb. There is a bit of a biscuit malt backbone, but this beer is all about the hops. Medium bitterness, but the bitterness is not overbearing. 
Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. An outstanding Double IPA. One of the best I have been fortunate enough to drink. 765 charactersMora2000, Dec 31, 2010
4.45/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Two day old Abrasive - you can't beat that. This one pours a nice amber with a good head on it. The smell is very much grapefruit and sweet malt. The flavor a also very much grapefruit/tropical fruit with a little bit of malt to back it up - but that's not the point of this one - it's a hop bomb. The tropical fruit and seet malt keep it light and not too bitter. As it warms the malt pokes out a bit more and a hint of alcohol comes on. It tastes quite a bit like a bigger version of Wet, which is one of my favorites. The mouthfeel is the only downfall to this brew, I was expecting a bit more body to it though I guess that might be expecting everything to be perfect. However, this is a very refreshing brew and not so ovewhelming that I could have 2-3, although the big ABV is a bit limiting. A great beer and probably the most Cali DIPA this side of the rockies. 869 charactersplumcrazyfx, Dec 31, 2010

First smell reminded me of my Christmas tree and then the citrus smells come through.
I liked the lower carbonation. 
There is no balance at all, just tons of hops, but I think that is what they were going for.
This beer is very good, but it is not impressive to just overload beer with hops. I am a novice home brewer and can easily make a beer like this for much less. 
I dont want to sound like I am bashing this beer, just expected more. It is good and definitely worth trying if you are a hop head 545 charactersKBC1, Dec 30, 2010

8.8% ABV
~120 IBUs
OG 19.5° Plato
Color 8° SRM
16 oz. canned on 12/20/2010 poured into a snifter on 12/21/2010. That's correct, 1 day old!
Appearance 4/5
Poured straw golden colored in a brilliantly glowing stream and looked amber-orange in the glass. Very clear but not crystal clear, perhaps because of being dry hopped and unfiltered. Good bone white head that dissipated fast and left little lacing. Odd.
Aroma 4/5
Very very fruity: mostly tropical fruit notes of mango, papaya, and then some pear, apricot. Smells similar to the same brewer's Wet. No alcohol burn or alcohol aroma at its ABV! Some onion-garlic notes that are not my favorite. An intense hoppiness but not the kind I like best, personally (pine, citrus... I wish)
Taste 4/5
Very fruity and a little sweet, light on palate but big on the bitterness at the end and in the aftertaste. Some citrus is noted in the aftertaste but overall the hop flavor is mostly of sweeter fruit. However, I am having second thoughts with at times overwhelming onion-garlic taste.
Mouthfeel 5/5
Well carbonated, but more smooth than crisp with a decent malt backbone and still clean finish.
Drinkability 4/5
An extremely easy drinking beer, but for the ABV. Mostly soft and pleasant on the senses, although I like my IPAs mean. Overly fruity for my tastes but what's worse are the discordant onion-garlic notes. That said, it's a straight up DIPA. A very good beer and highly recommended if fruity IPAs are your thing. 1,510 characterstewaris, Dec 29, 2010

S: Awesome smell. Haven't had this good an IPA since the triple Pliny the Younger by Russian River. Has a ton of papaya and guava that predominates the smell. Actually ends with a bit of smoke.
T: The citrusy hops take up most of the taste. Ends with a creamy pine finish. The finish is bitter but little aftertaste. 
M: Perfect level of carbonation. Fairly heavy, but not too thick.
D: Hides the abv, though the flavor is intense enough that it may not be too sessionable. Well, I take that back. It's delicious. I could have a ton of these. 630 characterslhaqq, Dec 29, 2010
4.6/5  rDev +3.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Picked up a 4pack from Blue Max for $15. Canned on 12-20-2010. Served into my Revolution 20ozer:
A - Pour produces a nice 1 inch thick white fluffy head which dies eventually to a nice white white foam ring around the edges with some nice cloudy in the middle. Nice copper, amber, golden color with bubbles floating up to the top. Lacing retention is sticky and patchy. 
S - Grapefruit, pineapple, other citrus notes as well as pine and nice danky smell. Reminds me of Wet with more of a pine bite. Very good.
T - Nice citrus tones that are found in the nose with pine and resinous flavors. Citrus flavors in the beginning then a nice floral arrangement in the middle and then pine and resin at the end. Its very delicious!
M - Great carbonation. On the lighter side considering the ABV. Smooth and refreshing.
D - Very, very good. Really easy to drink. Delicious DIPA that I wish I could drink all the time. Awesome job on the smell and flavors for this one, Surly. I'm glad they canned it again this year and hope they do it more in the future. 1,051 charactersjoshuaseresse, Dec 28, 2010
4.74/5  rDev +6.3%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Appearance - dark orange with a minimal white head at the the top.
Smell - Pine, citrus, pineapple and grapefruit.
Taste - This is a bold and extremely intense beer, the hops and malt balance nicely to create bitter and sweet perfection. Heavy pine and citrus flavors, the alcohol is very apparent. Deliciously drinkable.
Mouthfeel - Lingering alcohol/bitterness on the tongue, thick with low carbonation.
Drinkability - This beer is a beast. Complex, very hop forward, one of the best double IPA's I have ever drank for sure. I look forward to this every year. Surly creates some exceptional beers, this is no exception. 
Serving type: can poured into a Surly pint glass. 677 charactersminnesotaryan, Dec 28, 2010
5/5  rDev +12.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A: A nice amber colour with a nice fluffy white head. 
S: The smell is amazing. This beer right after you crack open the can bursts out the aroma of pine trees and citrus hops. I would love to have my house smell like this everyday. When drinking this beer I had to enhale the smell everytime before a sip.
T: This is the best double imperial IPA I have ever had. It is huge to say the least. Huge in hops and malts. Abrasive makes Furious seem weak. The difference is that big. Even though the ABV is 9% one would never have guest it. This beer is smooth.
D: The overall drinkability is incrediable. I wish I could buy this all year round. It is too bad that it is only brewed once a year. If you have not tried Abrasive and you are a hop head this beer should then be on the top of your wants list. 800 characterswrightro07, Dec 27, 2010
4.72/5  rDev +5.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Insanely flavorful IPA released today in cans. Had to get to the liquor store (France & 44th - they had lots) to make sure I got some of my favorite Surly brew.
Appearance - Orange beer with a small white head that quickly dissipates. No lacing on my glass. Not perfectly clear.
Smell - Pine trees, pineapple, fruit cocktail.
Taste - Huge bitterness followed by intense pineapple, pear, peach flavors with a little syrupy sweetness. The bitterness wipes my tongue clean at the start of every sip so I can experience it again and again. Alcohol is somewhat apparent in the back of my throat. A sweet beer but not cloying. Man candy.
Mouthfeel - Low carbonation but the bitterness makes it seem lively on my tongue. Medium to heavy thickness.
Drinkability - With the apparent alcohol, thick mouthfeel, and intense flavor, this is not a sessionable beer but that's not the point of a double IPA.
This is a beautiful beer. Get some. 934 charactersmousefool1, Dec 23, 2010

M - Medium Bodied with high carbonation
D - It's a bit more intense than Furious, but I love it. Some people may not want to drink a beer this intense for a whole session or on a regular basis, but I would love to drink Abrasive on the reg. 448 charactersTheDudeBeers, Dec 23, 2010
4.67/5  rDev +4.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A - Hazy amber body topped by a foamy one finger eggshell white head. Good head retention with spotty lacing.
S - Extremely citrusy hop nose. Pineapple, grapefruit and tangerine abound in a citrus and hop extravaganza. Smells extremely delicious!
T & M - Holy citrus hop goodness! I got this beer this Summer and waited to review the last can...I think the extra time mellowed the hops a bit. Don't get me wrong, there is still a voluminous hoppiness to it, but it seems to be balanced out with the malt a little more. There is a serious citrus aspect to this brew...it finishes like you just got done eating a tangerine. Medium bodied and very creamy and slick. This is about as good as it gets for a IIPA!
D - Three words...Through The Roof! I only wish they distributed in WI because this would be a daily staple in my fridge. Wow! Good stuff! 849 charactersdrizzam, Dec 09, 2010
4.56/5  rDev +2.2%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4As The CANQuest (TM) goes, I was Furious a short while ago and now I'm going to get downright Abrasive. The CAN's graphics take me back to the USS Fulton (AS-11), and my days as a general Deck seaman, chipping paint, grinding what I had just chipped and painting back over the chipped, ground surface. What a great life! I was in with stone psychos, both in terms of fellow deck hands and leadership. The ship was crazy and I fit right in. It set me on a path from which I have not yet returned and may never at the rate that I am going. A Happy Veterans Day (belated) to all of my brothers and sisters! We may have left as strangers, but we're all family now.
From the CAN: "Beer for a Glass, From a CAN."; "Fresh Beer, Keep It Cool!"; "Get Surly!"; "Sure we're abrasive. We were abrasive long before we were Surly. If you visit the brewery you [CAN] still see remnants of the industrial manufacturing factory Omar's parents ran for for 35 years within those same four walls. Bandsaw blades, grinding wheels, and sanding discs came long before ales and lagers. But let's be honest, this is a lot more fun. Pale in color, this over-hopped, under-brewed Double IPA has almost twice the amount of hops & malt crammed in the [CAN]." 
A note on this review: Based on one set of statistical data, including N2 CANs, this is CANQuest (TM) review # 400! 390 CO2 CANs + 10 N2 CANs = 400! And on New Beer Sunday # 300, no less! Milestones, all around. Yes, my math may CANstitute ticking, but as someone said, if it's truly fun, why not celebrate twice, meaning that CAN # 400 will also merit balloons and whistles. Hatas may line up at the door.
Hey, jagov, CAN we get a review, ya long-winded f**k?!?
Okay, following the Crack & Glug, I was facing a finger-and-a-half of dense, eggshell-white head with good retention. As it slowly fell, it left behind lacing that may require a chisel to remove. Also, who planted a pine forest in my kitchen? The place smells like I am out in the field with my uncle, the hunter, when I was just a kid. Color was a hazy orangish-amber and that was just fine with me. I have railed repeatedly on the negative aspects of filtration-driven clarity. If it falls bright, so be it, but to manually run a beer through screen to clean it up for the masses reeks of destruction. It strips out character and flavor, like giving me a frontal lobotomy. Maybe that's what they meant by "under-brewed". The nose was simply mouthwatering. It was like standing in an evergreen forest on a snowy day - cool, biting, fresh, resinous. Mouthfeel was medium but I could feel the grinder against my soft, pink tongue, removing everything in its path to my poor little taste buds, rocked into submission by so many AALs. My sinus cavity began to fill with the scent of industrial-strength pine and my tongue suddenly spontaneously combusted. I tried to put it out with another mouthful of beer, but it was like putting out fires with gasoline. Gah! This is why I got so deeply hooked as a hophead. Does anybody see a screeching monkey on my back all of a sudden? The finish was suddenly mellow, as though my nervous system had been ground down to the nerve endings and I was content to allow the Aeolian Harp to play across my spine. Gasp! A bandsaw blade to my Brain Housing Group might have the same effect. This ain't abrasive, it's downright industrial! I would be afraid to take this in my beach cooler - I'd end up like Bruce Dern at the end of "Coming Home": stripping off my dress blue uniform and wading into the surf, never to be heard from again.

Appearance: Pours and attractive light copper to pumpkin with honey folds. The crown is really nice...1 white finger with lots of retention and lace.
Smell: Grapefruit, grassy herbal notes and pine over sweet malt, caramel malt and a hint of tobacco. 
Taste: Same as nose. A healthy caramel malt dose but an undeniable grapefruit accompaniment. Bold yet balanced.
Mouthfeel: A touch thick with moderate to low carbonation.
Drinkability: Pretty hefty but very balanced. 532 characterskoopa, Oct 31, 2010

Aroma is a big dose of hops, including grass, earth, pine/resin, citrus and some rind, along with a hint of caramel. Flavor is sweet on the outset, followed by nicely balanced hops and malt, with spice, pine, grass/earth and more citrus rind and a mild lingering bitterness and some residual warmth. Nice stuff, if not a touch sweet, but still a very nice DIPA. 512 charactershophead247, Oct 12, 2010

S- Insanely fruity with strong pine and earthy hops.
T- Fruit juice and Furious. Insane amount citrus and pineapple from the hops with a great caramel malt background that is hard to reach with so much pine and earthy hop presence you'd be crazy not to try this brew!

4.59/5  rDev +2.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Appearance: By being unfiltered this Double IPA has a foggy but deep color structure. The body is mostly a dull, orangish gold with notes of light gold towards the bottle of the glass.
Smell: The complexity of the the smell makes it almost indescribable. It has strong, fresh hop notes that are led by sweet, full malty smells. The hop smells are a combination of floral and citrus aromas. The combination of Amarillo and Columbus hops are crafted well.
Taste: The sweet malt flavors are distributed well throughout the mouth with a hoppy freshness coming first and lingering for the duration of the tasting. As said before, the combination of hops are blended wonderfully and make for an extremely enjoyable taste.
Mouthfeel: The complex flavors wake certain taste buds from a slumber during the first sip. The mouth is covered well with strong but not overpowering flavors. Very well crafted.
Drinkability: The ABV may be pretty high (and not really noticeable) but if you somehow get your hands on a grip of Abrasive Ale you'll be sure to have a hard time stopping the consumption. 1,088 charactersbrewdub17, Sep 14, 2010

A - Golden amber, with modest white head and very good lacing.
S - Floral hop bouquet, acidic citrus, cat urine, and a dab of honey. Wow.
T - Citrus bitterness mixed with floral hops and wildflower honey up front, with some caramel in the middle. Although a sweetness remains throughout, the hops are more than enough to keep me enthralled - the slightly sugary, yet blisteringly bitter piny finish and aftertaste are flat out amazing. I can't even imagine this fresh.
M - Deliciously chewy for a beer this hoppy; a bit like HopSlam in that regard - pure hop nectar. Good carbonation.
D - Due to scarcity, one is perfect. If I lived in Minnesota, two would be great!
Blown away despite high expectations, I'm in awe. I reserve the right to up the taste score after trying this fresh next year - it's absolutely stellar now, but giving a 5 is unfair, as I know it'll be even better. Omar, I love you. 938 charactersklikger, Aug 30, 2010

An amber/golden body with a two finger head that exhibits good retention. Nice lacing.
Smells of caramel/toffee malts and floral/piney hops.
Caramel/toffee malts are knocked away by resin and floral hops, intensely piney and slightly citrusy hops (grapefruit/orange zest). Pine and resin bitterness take over, but the caramel/toffee malt sweetness keeps bitterness in check.
Full-bodied, oily, well carbonated with a crisp and slightly dry finish and lingering hop bitterness that boarders on smokiness.
Definitely a piney bitter chop to the throat style DIPA. I'm into that, so solid drinkability in my books. 665 charactersbillshmeinke, Aug 27, 2010

Aroma is burnt caramel in front of sharp pine hops. The taste is a nice amount of pine hops just in front of a nice burnt caramel backbone, very nice balance with the hops winning out while not entirely overpowering. The beer is medium bodied with well hidden alcohol, quite smooth and refreshing. I must say, this is a very enjoyable DIPA, one I would certainly love to have again. 581 charactersatsprings, Aug 21, 2010
4.4/5  rDev -1.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Poured from a can into a pint glass. It pours a very nice golden amber color. A 1/4 off-white head forms and slowly reduces leaving a blotchy full coverage lacing. No sediment and carbonation visible.
The aroma is mostly pine with some nice sweet lemon/grapefruit in the background. Not too complex but very good.
The taste is also very good with primarily a hoppy pine/citrus component with some malty almost honey like sweetness.
The mouthfeel is full bodied and strong, but quite smooth. Interestingly, abrasive as the drink continues leaving a strong dryness on the palate at the end. Carbonation is solid as well.
This beer is easy to drink initially but seems to build up a head of steam and the palate gets destroyed by the end. ABV is hidden to me and it is very good overall, but difficult to have more than one. 825 charactersSykDoc, Aug 20, 2010

a - pours a hazy golden amber color, two-finger off-white head with awesome retention and lacing, especially for the abv, really a great looking beer 
s - big pine, grapefruit and orange citrus hop bouquet on the nose with a substantial caramel malt component providing some depth, I suspect the aroma may have been a bit more hop dominated closer to the release, but the hops are still plenty present, light alcohol heat in the aroma as well
t - the hops may have faded a bit more in the taste than in the aroma, but once again, this is still a very hoppy beer, big punch of sweet and bitter orange citrus up front with lighter notes of grapefruit and pine, midpalate is a bit sweet with a nice caramel malt component providing a backbone to the hop bitterness, the finish has a really nice bitter but lightly sweet orange marmalade flavor, definitely on the dry side, but not overly so, the alcohol is relatively well hidden with only a light boozy heat on the finish
m - medium-to-full bodied, moderate carbonation, finish is on the dry side, nice alcohol warming
d - quite drinkable for a big DIPA, I suspect this has become a bit more "balanced" since it's release, the alcohol is there but not overwhelming at all, very interesting and clean flavors
Another very impressive beer from Surly. The hops have really held up nicely on this, and I can't wait to try it fresh upon the next release. 1,438 charactersWeisGuy, Aug 11, 2010

A: Pours a honey golden yellow color. Slightly cloudy. Huge 3 fingers of foamy head. Great retention and beautiful lacing. Great looking DIPA. 
S: Nice hop overload smell. Bitter piney hops with a background of floral and citrus. Not too much malt comes through. Very West coast in style. 
T: Wow. Super bitter finish. Up front there is more of a fruity hop, almost sweet flavor. Actually pick up a little malt that wasnt present in the aroma. That finish just crushes the pallet though. 
M: Nice and crisp. Good body with quite a bit of carbonation. Bitterness in the finish leaves the tongue and mouth parched. 
D: Very nice DIPA. Not the best I have had, but it is better than most. This was a pleasant surprise. I would def drink this again and glad I got a 4 pack. 9%? Went down easy and was perfect for a nice summer evening. 908 charactersboothbeer, Aug 09, 2010
4.09/5  rDev -8.3%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Found this on tap at Stub & Herb's in Minneapolis. It shines clear and amber with a fair white head that quickly fades to a mere ring with very good lacing. The aroma is a pretty intense, sweet grapefruit/juniper hop with a modicum of raspberry malt bleeding through. Strong and tempting. The first taste is pretty in line with the aroma, somewhat syrupy fruity hops with a fair bready malt undercurrent. It still evokes a curious but likeable juniper/evergreen idea in a medium plus bodied brew. Definitely a brew of solid constitution that demands some appreciation but it hides its 9.5% ABV quite well allowing for decent drinkability for the style. Mild carbonation but a smooth, somewhat thick feel that goes down quite reasonably. 736 charactersDurge, Aug 07, 2010

T - Huge syrupy malts that are envoloped in a thick blanket of grapefuit hopes.

4.08/5  rDev -8.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4A: Hazy orange/ brown hue with a minimal but steady head; lacing is good
S: A pungent alcohol smell sits on top of a sweet malty base; candied sugars and a syrupy fruitiness pervades; the pine/citrus hops peaks through the sweet alcohol
T: Much smoother than the alcholy sweetness from the aromas would indicate; a grainy maltiness is as prevalent as the candied sugar; piney hops, and alcohol presence is strong; there is also a slight earthiness that oddly pulls all the flavors together nicely
F: Decent mouth feel; it especially coats the roof of the mouth well; there is a subtle syrupy quality that works well with this beer
D: A bit much to do too much, but this is a good brew; maybe a bit sweet and alcoholy at times but for the most part this beer works well for what it is 787 charactersdbossman, Aug 04, 2010
4.22/5  rDev -5.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to grub for this one. Had this last Saturday night while camping in NH and paired with my supper, burgers.
Poured from a 16oz. can.
Appearance: Pours a hazy, dark orange almost brown body with an easy 2 finger head and a nice cascade of bubbles.
Smell: Succulent mango, grapefruit and pineapple. Sweet smelling with lots of hops. Quite juicy.
Taste: Tropical fruit, lots of grapefruit with hops in the fore and a very strong malt on the backend. Around the edges, i'm getting some sweet flavor, sugar maybe? Bitter but not overly so which disappoints me a bit.
Mouthfeel: More balanced than expected as the malt rivals with the hops. Creamy and mouthfilling.
Drinkability: Despite ABV and strong flavor, it still is very drinkable and something i'd have again.
Overall: A good DIPA. Not my fave but it is right up there. 834 characterspapat444, Aug 03, 2010

Pours a dark peach color with a really nice off white head. Good retention and lacing. The beer is pretty light colored for a dipa...The aroma is super sweet, light caramel, really nice grapefruit with a light alcoholy hop finish. Its not overly strong in respect but nice to smell and balanced...The taste is pretty decent, doesn't hold up as well as the aroma though. A pretty sweet alcohol dominates the flavor, light pine, a little grapefruit. More pine on the finish. A little too much alcohol, but I was told to drink quickly as the hops might be fading so maybe that is the case? I would love t try this fresth...The feel is pretty light, very warm alcohol finish, but still super easy to drink.
This is a sweeter pretty solid dipa. I would love to try it fresh, but I would take a Surly Furious over this any day. 896 charactersjrallen34, Jul 24, 2010

A very clear light copper to dark yellow color poured out onto the frisbee golf course amidst the homeless in Oates Park, Fallon, NV. Great hop aroma and glowing color. 
Very much on the grapefruit hop edge, with the slightest pineapple twinge . Light body. Very drinkable, watch out you won't be able to pick up the alcohol anywhere near its advertised amount. Great carbonation leads to some tasty burps on this one. The bitterness is just right, didn't ruin any subsequent beers out on the course. A small dose of pine. Citrus moreso though. Tough to keep your hands off this one. 656 charactersBeerandraiderfan, Jul 21, 2010

Pours a bright copper, just a bit of haze, with a nice, two-finger off-white head that settles into a nice, dense cap. Nice retention and epic lacing. 
Nose is big and vibrant - juicy mix of pineapples and oranges, grapefruit and pine, with a heady dose of caramel and spicy alcohol. 
Taste follows suit; huge mix of tropical fruit and grapefruit, just a bit green, coupled to a big spicy alcohol bite. Strong backbone of lightly bready, sweet caramel malt underneath. Lingering dry bitterness mixes with more alcohol and the last of the massive citrusy hops. Hugely prickly, spicy, delicious. Fantastic beer. 
Mouthfeel is dry, prickly, a bit oily, with a nice bite. Full bodied all the way, with a light, beautifully done carbonation, almost creamy. Very nice. 
Drinkability is top notch. Really, a delicious example of the style that is just bursting with hop flavor. Fantastic and addictive. 1,013 charactersJohnQVegas, Jul 18, 2010
4.64/5  rDev +4%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Had this beer on tap at the brewery tour just before this year's NHC. Also had it out of one of the cans we brought back. This review is from the beer out of a can.
The aroma is an intense mix of pine, grapefruit, and lemons. It is wonderful!
The appearance initially is a cloudy dark straw color with a thin white head. It looks like it is loaded with hop resins. Later, after the beer warmed, it was crystal clear (chill haze).
The mouthfeel is fairly full with medium carbonation and a maybe a little "coolness" (sorry - the best way I can describe it). It reminds me a little bit of the "coolness" you get in a sweet stout from the added lactic sugar. I'm guessing there is some added unfermentable sugar added to increase the body.
The taste is filled with strong pine and grapefruit flavors, with the malt providing a bready, white bread, sweetness to provide some balance. The bitterness is strong but not harsh. The finish is fairly medium.
This is a wonderfully drinkable double IPA. I am very impressed by this offering. I would have given it a five if the finish had been drier. 1,094 characterswestweasel, Jul 14, 2010

Poured into a tulip glass. Pours a dark amber hue with a thick off-white head on top. Excellent retention; left spotty lacing all over the glass. Big, powerful citrus notes waft out. Lots of pineapple, grapefruit, with a touch of pine needles. 
The body on this beer is a disappointment though. Very slick and thin. Expecting a full-bodied beer, the flatness really let me down. Great flavoring of grapefruit, some sweet orange, candied malts (gives it a sweet punch), and a great bitter afterbite. This is a good beer. Tweak that mouth and this is a stellar beer. 599 charactersOnenote81, Jul 12, 2010

Thanks to Wisconsinality for this sought-after can!
A - Abrasive pours clear gold with a frothy bone head. The foam reaches around three fingers before dropping down to a sliver of bubbles rather quickly. Thin and scattered sheets of lace cling reluctantly to the glass.
S - Mountains of hops unleash a strong citrus aroma packed full of grapefruit and floral notes. Pine needle is there too but largely overshadowed. Mango and pineapple also make an aggressive appearance adding nicely to the citrusy, fruity aroma. Heavy malting backs up the heavy hops with a lightly sweet caramel kiss and good balance.
T - Even with the aggressive hop addition, the malts really balance out nicely. Sweet caramel and honey-drizzled toast assume a large role of the flavor while mango, pineapple, and grapefruit citrus are slightly secondary. The balance is very nicely done.
M - Medium-full bodied and fairly sweet, Abrasive is a heavily hopped DIPA with a moderate citrus bitterness to the finish. The sweetness may get slightly cloying as it is pretty strong.
D - This is a decently drinkable DIPA but after a while it got rather cloying to me with how sweet the malts are. It actually could have been a little more crisp in the mouthfeel. 1,289 charactersBeerFMAndy, Jul 12, 2010

S-Big on tropical and citrus hops: papaya, mango, grapefruit, orange and a bit of pine with some sweet caramel notes
T-Piney and mango/papaya with some bitter grapefruit on the finish. The malt here really helps balance this one, but not to the point that the hops are are overshadowed, because they are definitely here.
M-Really smooth in the mouth with a low amount of carbonation and it's medium bodied.
D-This is one pretty impressive brew. The nose alone makes me want to smell it all day. Not to mention the insane drinkability this 9% beer has. It drinks more like a 6%... be warned. 683 characterssamie85, Jul 11, 2010
4.75/5  rDev +6.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4A huge thanks to my loving wife who brought home a 4-pack of this delicious beer and to her mom who made the effort to find and buy it.
Served cool from the 16oz. can into a pint glass. It seems to pour slowly from the can like it's a little thicker than most. 
Abrassive is a beautiful golden copper color with thick sticky head. Good clarity and perfect lacing left behind.
Aroma is wonderful and fresh. Like any DIPA worth a damn, it smells just like when you open a bag of hops or crush some fresh cones in your hands. There's great citrus and pine and it almost seems resiny before I've taken a sip.
Flavor is a hop explosion in my mouth! So bitter, so hoppy, so... abrassive? Well it's not silky smooth but it is damn tasty. Again huge citrus, pine, grapefruit, spice. I would love to know what hops were used because this is really 3-dimensional where a lot of DIPAs (step forward Gubna) can seem flat. It's also nice to see that this beer has balance. A solid malt backbone supports the crazy-hoppy bitterness.
Mouthfeel is medium bodied and lowish carbonation. Actually really nice for the style here as well. Where some can be seem too hoppy/bitter/alcoholic because of the higher carbonation, Abrassive really nails it.
Overall a fantastic beer and probably one of my favorites of all time. I just wish I could get it more often! 1,346 charactersGilGarp, Jul 11, 2010
4.82/5  rDev +8.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Right out of the can, Abrasive is a stunner. Deep gold with only the trace of a veil, Abrasive rewards an agressive pour with a thick downy head that has a slight buttercream tinge.
The smell is easy to test as you can perceive the hop aromas from a distance. Closer inspection gives you the details: a truly complex whiff of citrus rind, mango and a bit of pine in the background as well as a rich flan smell from the malt. If condensed to a spray deodorant, I would want my entire apartment to smell like this beer.
The taste offers the same complexity, especially to those who linger and let the beer warm a few degrees from the fridge. It starts fruit-forward: mango, orange rind and pineapple. The sweet caramel note then comes in to take the lead. Just when you fear that the beer will turn too strongly to the malt side of the equation, the sweetness fades and pine/mint flavors that have played only a supporting role get to have their say. The finish is a pure pleasure. The alcohol must be on siesta, because it is almost imperceivable, leaving the lingering bitterness, pine and sugared grapefruit flavors to casually fade.
The mouthfeel is nearly perfect, but might be just a bit too thick/full for some. Although this is blatant nitpicking, that fact knocks drinkability down one peg.
That minor criticism aside, this beer can be summed up with two words and one acronymn: Top. Five. DIPA. 1,406 characterschicagobeerriot, Jul 10, 2010
4.92/5  rDev +10.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Big thanks go out to checkii for sending a few cans of Abrasive my way. I'm a pretty huge Surly fan, and I know they can brew a good IPA...Furious remains one of the best I've ever tasted. So, you can only imagine my excitement to have two cans of (yet another) A-rated Surly goodness.
Right out of the gates, I'm already shocked by this beer. Most of my IPA/DIPA reviews mention the fact that I can't find a way to describe their color aside from the standard "orange-amber." Well, Abrasive Ale is a bit more vibrant, a fiery orange. White head reaches a finger, and I don't leave the beer in the glass long enough to learn too much about its retention. The lacing on the inside of the glass makes me think of catacombs - thick white lines with oddly-shaped, skull-like circles in between. Great looking beer.
The aroma is unbelievable. In my eyes, there is nothing finer than a citrus-heavy hop bomb. Well, Abrasive Ale sure smells like it's headed in that direction. Grapefruit, orange, and tangerine dominate the nose. I don't know if it's physically possible to smell bitterness, but I'm pretty sure I am right now. It's huge without being too much so, if that makes sense. It smells like an epic DIPA without smelling like a palate-wrecker or a booze bomb.
Throughout my drinking experience with Abrasive Ale, the word "unbelievable" kept coming to mind. Bursting with hop flavor, a cornucopia of fruit flavors (or whatever the hell David Alan Grier said on SNL as Maya Angelou talking about Fruit Loops), with a fairly restrained bitterness, but just enough to remind you that you're dealing with a pretty damn big double IPA. It's not like Ruination in that you recoil after each sip (but that's a good recoil, if that makes sense), rather, it's like a more balanced HopSlam, I suppose. There's a pretty fair amount of sweetness that keeps things relatively balanced...or at least about as balanced as a Surly double IPA is going to get. Just remarkable.
Now, the only disappointment is the texture. And damn, I feel like such an ass for calling it a disappointment, because it's a 4.5 instead of a 5. It's somewhat sticky, lightly chewy...a tad less carbonation, and this would be absolutely perfect. But, again, we're talking about the difference between a 4.5 and a 5. 
Drinkability? Uh, this beer is TOO drinkable. I grabbed one can out of the fridge, figuring it would be a nice nightcap, and that would be it. Within 15 minutes of opening the first can, I was walking back to the kitchen for the second. Unbelievable. Can I say it enough? 9% alcohol? No way. I don't believe it. The most drinkable double IPA I've ever had, bar none. 
This beer falls just shy of perfection, but not by a whole lot. An amazing drinking experience that I'd recommend to anyone...hophead, malthead (is that a recognized term here?), anyone...this is a beer you should try. If nothing else, it will show you what a world-class DIPA is all about. 2,945 charactersGyle41386, Jul 10, 2010

Slightly bitter initially with a good amount of grapefruit and floral hops...malt is prevalent, sweet, caramel adds a nice balance to the IPA, neither aspect overpowers the other...

Citrus, especially grapefruit, runs true and fresh...like just squeezed juice. Honeyed, floral malt/hop combo make for a pretty crazy smelling beer.
Taste is like biting into a piece of grapefruit peel that has been soaked in vodka and onion juice. Mild earth-tones seem both foreign and belonging at the same time amongst the bright aspects of the beer. Dont get me wrong, the beer is bitter, but there is so much more to offer in terms of hop flavor here...so juicy, piney, resinous and delicious. Had this side by side with Gubna, Abrasive wins cans down. Awesome beer and an awesome DIPA. 738 characterstwiggamortis420, Jul 08, 2010

A - Beautiful, crystal-clear amber with a creamy off-white head.

T - Big notes of orange and grapefruit citrus. More piney hops. Light caramel malt provides a sturdy backbone, but doesn't try to compete with the hops. Really well done.
M - One of the best mouthfeels I've had from a IPA/DIPA. Velvety and creamy, incredibly smooth with spot-on prickly carbonation. No trace of ABV.

A: Brilliant deep straw to apricot body with a two-finger head of medium bubble that rapidly dissipates leaving only the slightest lace and very little cover.
S: Amazing apricot and pineapple citrus fills the glass. Wonderfully balanced with caramel malt character. Some pine in the background just to keep it interesting. 
T: The sweet flavor of apricots and malt strike me immediately. This is my definition of a great IIPA. The flavors are exquisitely balanced and don't harass the tongue the way some over eager, over aggressive IIPA hop bombs can. 
M: Smooth medium body with medium carbonation (perhaps just a tad too much), but the overall effect works well with this beer. Finishes dry.
D: For a big beer this one goes down easy and can be a bit dangerous. Only loses points for being 9.0% abv.
O: Great beer. Great conversation. Great memories. I can't wait until we meet again. 929 charactersdpnelson1978, Jul 04, 2010

Pours a thick, translucent golden amber color with a massive, creamy off white head that has excellent retention and nearly coats the entire glass in lacing. Aroma is pungent and fresh, dominated by tropical citrus and some light floral hops. Body is medium thick, with dine light carbonation. The finish is bitter and hoppy, but not very dry or clean. This isn't a bad thing though since the flavor is a pile of citrusy, primarily grapefruit, hops and a strong balancing malt body. The wet finish lingers with sweet citrus flavors and a slight pinch of alcohol. Overall, a unique over the top yet well balanced DIPA. 671 charactersyourefragile, Jul 03, 2010

Poured from a 16oz can into my tasting snifter glass. Pours an great glowing orange/melon looking color with a huge frothy white head. Appearance is hazy, and just awesome looking! Provides a great display of lacing to-boot! Very patchy...long lasting/sticky lacing!
Aroma is perfect! Amoung the tops in best aromas for IPA's! Tons of sharp hops, grapefruit and other fresh sweet tropical fruits! Just perfect!
Flavor follows the aroma "right on the money!" The hops hit right away, and absorb into the mouthfull of sweet tropical fruits! It's hard to explain, beacause it's not quite like a DIPA, not heavy in malts at all, but the hop sharpness is ever so pleasant! The most common fruit I can pick up, is the grapefruit...and the beer finishes slightly dry and leaves you wanting more. A GREAT IPA for the summer time...thirst quenting! Body is medium to light, perfect medium to high carbonation...and a great drinker! Great IPA from Surly! 1,030 charactersShadesOfGray, Jun 26, 2010

A: Beautiful copper rust color with hints of ruby red trying to bleed through. Small cream colored head that fades at a decent pace. Good.
S: Super earthy hops blended with sweet citrus flavors. Hints of pine in the middle mixed with a steady grapefruit scent. Good.
T: Hit with a grapefruit bitterness upfront immediately then followed by some piney hop. Sweet citrus in the middle with hints of malt balancing this off on the back. A lot better balanced than most IPA's. Not a total hop bomb. Don't get me wrong, there are tons of hops here, they are just balanced very well compared to some of the super bitter hoppy beers. Very good.
M: A hint too much carbonation on the brew. Leaves some nice flavors on the palate. Good.
D: This brew goes down a lot easy than expected for an IPA. Very Good.
Very glad I got to try this brew. Thanks for sending this to me Jose. Very good for the IPA lover and good for the malt monster that has been getting into IPA's. Definitely try this brew. 1,047 characterssteve8robin, Jun 26, 2010

Surly Abrasive Ale appears clear with a pretty good sized head and decent lacing. There is a very strong pine aroma with hops and citrus coming in behind. The taste is more of what I found in the nose and quite enjoyable. The finish was interesting, in that much more of a malt presence emerged than the aroma would have indicated. Grapefruit and pine are also very notable throughout, and linger on the palate, creating a very pleasant aftertaste. All in all, Abrasive Ale is an excellent DIPA, and certainly one I'd like to have again. And again... 602 charactersHuhzubendah, Jun 24, 2010

Taste is up there with the smell, big orange, tropical fruits with a some sugary sweetness and a faint malt backing. Smooth, velvety mouth feel with great carbonation.

S- citrus hops screams at you as soon as the can opens, Orange mainly also kind of a pineapple smell too, a piny smell comes after the hit from hops
T-Just like the smell I first taste an orange citrus hoppy taste and then a piny after taste, thought I would taste more malt in it but it just sits subtle through out the whole flavor which probably works best to balance it out. The is an after bitterness with a little bit of the alcohol coming through but it is not bad at all.

(A)- Pours a clear amber color that produced a great off-white head with great retention too. Left plenty of lacing as it dissipated.
(S)- A dry resin-like pine with lemon, lime, pineapple, and grapefruit citrus. A light honey-like sweetness.
(T)- A thinner hop profile than what the smell led me to believe. A maltier/sweeter profile of a honey/pineapple/caramel thing with the hops being an afterthought, but yet present on the finish with a light lemon bitterness. 
(M)- A good carbonation level. Much much maltier than I expected. Also, much more sweeter because of the malt profile. The hops are there, but much more subtle than they should be for the style.
(D)- This is good, but far too malty for the style in my opinion. The hop profile is great in the aroma, but in the taste and mouthfeel they are far lacking in presence like they should. Do not get me wrong, I enjoyed this beer, but I was expecting more for the style it is classified under. 1,091 characterssweemzander, Jun 21, 2010

The color is an admixture of copper and waves of amber grain, the cap of foam placed solidly above it. 
Citrus and flower tower above this beer to create an aroma fit for the style. The malt nectar succumbs to its hoppy brethren. 
This beer assaults the taste buds with hops. The bitterness of dandelion greens and grass is followed by lemon and flowers. The caramel malt is left to rear its head after the first wave of hops, providing needed balance. 
This is a heavy beer and a good one. It would be difficult to drink this beer all night, but is a DIPA suppose to be a session beer? 753 charactersBeardedBoffin, Jun 21, 2010

Specials thanks to kbutler for trading with me.
Appearance: orange and brown, clear with w finger of head leaving a spotty and weblike lacing.

Aroma - as soon as I popped the can open I could smell the piney notes. Definitely a sign of good things to come. There are also a lot of tropical fruit aromas coming out of this as well. I find myself smacking my lips every time I go in for another whiff. Mango, pineapple, pine needles and nectarine. I'd like to dive right in, but metaphorically and literally. 
Taste - ahhh...the palate is drenched and the fun begins. Definitely a hoppy brew but yet its not one-sided and just a boat load of hop bitterness. This has character and balance and its definitely high octane. You can feel the weight of this brew in your mouth and all that sweetness backing up those 120 IBUs. Very smooth mouthfeel (see that bit about oats below) and a bit of back and forth between bitter and sweet in the aftertaste. Absolutely delicious!
Overall - impressive to say the least and certainly living up to the hype (as much as a beer can these days). Surly delivers a very solid, very hoppy yet super smooth brew that stands apart from Furious as its own breed of IPA. It has an incredible aroma and a tangy and bitter flavor profile that has a bite but should be tamed easily by any experienced hophead. Lots of amazing tropical fruit flavors come out in this brew and I must say its ridiculously manageable at just under 10%. I think you'll be very happy if one of these should end up in your hands.
Would I buy more of it? - absolutely. I love it just like I loved Furious and pretty much everything else they brew. Give me a four-pack of these and I'd be a happy camper. 1,786 charactersindiapaleale, Jun 16, 2010

4.0 A: Hazy orangish brown color. One and a half fingers of yellowish white head with average retention and spotty lacing.
5.0 S: Excellent! Wonderful bouquet of floral and citrus notes. Orange, tangerine, mango are most dominant. Soft sweetness and a tinge of alcohol beneath the hops.
5.0 T: It tastes as good as it smells and that is saying something. Bitterness is perceived as mild due to the plentiful hop flavors. Loads of citrus again with the fruits mentioned in the nose. Soft sweetness, but the malts are very much overshadowed by the hops. Still, without this subtle sweetness this beer wouldn't be as good. The 9% ABV is hardly detectable. I think the reason I like it so much is because it seems to share a few aspects with NN, which is my favorite brew.
4.0 M: Medium body. Good moderate carbonation. Fairly creamy. I would like just a touch more body.
5.0 D: Really great brew. Surly does nothing but impress me with what they make and this is no exception. Super smooth with a great taste, I could drink this all night. Well done. 1,110 charactersDavoleBomb, Jun 12, 2010

Pouring a crystal clear light copper with a dense off-white head with excellent retention and lacing, this beer is near perfect. It smells it too, with a majestic tropical fruit medley. Big, juicy, ripe fruit character, there's pineapple, tangerines, fragrant nectarines and grapefruit. While strong, there's a lot of depth to the aromas that make up the nose. Slightly spicy, pungent peppery hop character is noticeable too. Excellent stuff.
I remember being struck by how juicy and fruity the original 16 Grit was, and that memory persists. Massively fruity with pineapple, peach, apricot and a little grapefruit and citrus, this has a ton of hop flavor. Malt flavor is mild, there's a little sweetness. Bitterness is rather low, letting the fruit flavors rise. Drying and fruity on the finish with a great hop character, this beer is medium-light in body with a great level of carbonation (moderate).

Honeyed bicuits aroma with apricot jam, and a glass of grapefruit juice. The stale garlicky bad breath aroma ruins things a bit. Otherwise, it'd be alright.
The malt throws down a quilt of lightly sweet breadiness, not unlike powdered doughnuts. It's delicious here and the hops haven't even arrived yet. When they do, everything falls into confusion. A flash of pineapple. A ghost of mango. A shadow of grapefruit. Then a more concrete materialization of onion skins and garlic.
The medium full body is aided by the fleecy, steadfast carbonation. The alcohol is a nonfactor. I find myself drinking it fairly quickly, despite not enjoying certain aspects.
The garlic and onion notes partially ruin this for me, but this is not GUBNA..I was able to get past them. More pressing was that as a beer calling itself Abrasive, the hopping was anything but. Furious is considerably more bitter than this. 
I don't understand the love the love here. 1,023 characterscokes, Jun 11, 2010
4.13/5  rDev -7.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to Scoobydank for this treat. I love Surly cans the do make my day and the can do an IPA.
Can pored into a strait pint glass produced a nice two finger white head that lasted a while and the trailed of to a great lace. The body had a beautiful apricot colored hue to it. You got some great fresh citrus hops aromas' from the glass as you held it to your lips.
The flavor was nicely balanced for a DIPA not a west coast one for sure. The grapefruit bitter was blended with a orange sweetness. It reminded me of a tropical drink and it was quite refreshing. It had a medium feel to it with a ton of carbonation. A great drinking DIPA I would have loved a six pack of this brew but was thankful for the one. 712 charactersjoepais, Jun 10, 2010
4.47/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Huge thanks to wisconsinality (actually his lady) for snagging this one for me.
Poured from the can into my pint glass the beer is a hazy golden orange. About two fingers of dull white head recede to leave an insanely thick ring of lace around the rim. A nice quarter inch cap has formed on top of the beer.
The aroma is full on citrus hops. Loads of grapefruit, mango, oranges and pineapple. It's like a tropical fruit salad. The sweetness of the malt comes through to moderately balance things out. Still a hop bomb for sure. Love it.
The flavor is much more balanced than the nose. The citrus blast is there but the malt "grinds" away at it. Had to do it. It all mixes well though.
Medium creamy body. Moderate carbonation.
Overall another great beer from Surly. Not surprising at all. Glad I got the chance to give this one a whirl. 841 charactersbeerwolf77, Jun 10, 2010

S- Wow...citrus every where on this one. Oranges mainly but also can pick up some pineapple and other tropical fruits. Piney as well, but there is also some strong bready malts too. 
T- Follows the nose as well, about every tropical fruit possible along with a good amount of pine. Also has a great strong malt back bone here as well. A very great DIPA.
M- Fuller side of mediun in body and in carbonation. 
D- Qutie a bit going on in this one. Very solid brew and easy to drink. I really wish Surly was easier to get for me, but its very solid and easy to drink. 716 charactersnrbw23, Jun 08, 2010

A - Dark orange, copper in color, with a 1-2 finger head with good retention. 
S - The smell of this beer is incredible - juicy citrus hops, with some piney hops as well. 
T - one of the better DIPAs I've had for sure. Citrus hops up front with a strong malt backbone, reminiscent of honey. after a few sips, the sweetness of this brew overpowers the initial hoppiness. 
M - great mouthfeel. thick, sticky, and chewy with just the right amount of carbonation. 
D - very drinkable, however, this beer's drinkability is slightly limited by the sweetness of the malt backbone. the 9% abv is hidden well. 724 charactersairohead2001, Jun 07, 2010

A: light amber in color with a 1 finger off white head. This beer has an excellent head retention and a good amount of lacing too.
S: Carmel, maple syrup, lemons, and a hint of peanut butter. A complex beer that made me very eager to give it a taste.
T: A little sweeter than expected which for me is a good thing as I am not the biggest fan of pure hop-bombs. 
M: Perfect level of carbonation. A smooth drink, with just a tad of stickiness at the end.
D: Very good drinkability. This was quite an enjoyable IPA. 575 charactersglazeman, Jun 07, 2010
4.32/5  rDev -3.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4On draft at Hopleaf...
Appears a hazy orange toned amber with a small white head of foam that quickly fades into a silky ap and collar. Tubular lacing is left around the glass.
Smell is of heavy citrus with orange peel, flowers, and a touch of caramel. 
Taste is of the aromas with some orange blossom honey notes and "abrasive" notes of hers and cut wood in the finish.
Mouthfeel is full bodied, herbal, and chewy with heavy hop syrup. 436 charactersweeare138, Jun 07, 2010
4.32/5  rDev -3.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4The body is a beautiful crystal clear orange. Head is tight and leaves a spotty lacing. 
This has an extremely fresh smell about it and the hop profile is loaded with citrus, most notably oranges and tangerine, with grapefruit and tropical fruits splashed in there. There is a sugary sweetness that holds it together. 
The taste mirrors the smell to a tee. Predominantly citrus. Bitterness is moderate but there is a strong sweet malt that adds some structure to it. 
Mouthfeel is resinous and sticky. Very clean tasting in west coast fashion. 
Good drinkability for a DIPA that weighs in at 9%. This is an exceptional DIPA. 628 charactersVonerichs, Jun 04, 2010
4.55/5  rDev +2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.516 ounce can brought to my be BA Hooliganlife's brother. So glad I got to try this. Poured into a tulip glass. 
The Abrasive ale pours a deep yellow almost gold color with a nice 2 finger white head and lots of lacing on the glass. Very good start with the pour. Smell is dominated with hops. Some subtle citrus fruit and pine undertones but the aromas are almost pure hops. Taste is unbelievable. Lots of hops but yet very smooth drinking. More of the citrus fruits come through in the quaff. The uniqueness of this beer is that it is bitter up front and has a lingering sweetness to it. Mouthfeel is creamy and medium bodied. Drinkability is above average. I could drink this brew every night if I were able to. Thanks so much Scotty! 737 charactersabrand, Jun 04, 2010
4.35/5  rDev -2.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 516oz can received in trade courtesy of scoobydank. Thanks for this one Bill! Poured into a Portsmouth tulip.
A - Pours a very clear orangey amber color that almost glows in the light. A two finger cap of dense, long lasting, cream colored foam sits on top. Nice sticky lacing left behind on the glass as the beer level falls.
S - Citrusy up front, grapefruity and orangey with a chaser of pineapple. Some sugary sweetness and some bready malt. Surprisingly bright, light, and fruity in aroma. The overall fruity, citrusy aromas are a bit unique and very good. I'm having trouble coming up with words to describe this...the citrusy and somewhat tropical aromas are intense, but still light and crisp. The closest I can come to describe it is that its like the smell in the air just as you start to peel an orange and a grapefruit at the same time and the fine spray mist escapes from the fruit. Smells very fresh!
T - Very smooth double IPA. Bitterness is not especially high. Focus seems to be more on hop flavor. As expected from the aroma, citrus is the focus - nice grapefruity bitterness and tons of sweet orangey flavor. Malt apparently really eccentuates the fruit flavor through sugary sweetness. Malt balance is good.
M - Medium bodied tending towards full. Carbonation is at a medium level, but very fine. Sticky hoppy resins with a glaze of malt sweetness all combine to coat the mouth completely.
D - Ummm...this is way too drinkable. Tons of hop flavor without an overwhelming bitterness. Very, very smooth. This might be the easiest drinking DIPA I've ever had. Very nice beer...glad I have a couple more of these to savor. Thanks again Bill! 1,660 charactersportia99, Jun 04, 2010
4.34/5  rDev -2.7%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Thanks to ipa247, colonelforbin, largadeer, and millah for sharing/giving/trading me various cans of this. 
A: Pours a clear, light amber-orange body with a finger of cream-colored head. It has good retention and leaves some lacing down the sides of the tulip. 
S: Citrus. But, unusually, the first aroma I pick up is peaches. It's really vibrant, incredibly fresh, and altogether startling. Very, very unique. Pineapple, and then tangerines. It develops into 'traditional' orange and a hint of grapefruit as I sniff more, but what an interesting bouquet. It's mildly floral. Some sugar cookie and a fair amount of bread. Undoubtedly one of the most interesting DIPAs I've ever smelled. 
T: As the nose suggests, it's a citrus cornucopia; I'm really digging the unique flavor profile on this one. The peaches, pineapple, and tangerine are well-done. They blend nicely with sugar cookie sweetness to produce a candied fruit effect, although that results in the beer being maltier than expected. The hop profile is decidely West Coast, but the malt profile is decidedly not. 
M: It's not abrasive at all. Medium-full bodied, with medium carbonation. Some heat. A sticky, bitter finish. 
D: It feels a bit rich, which forces me to slow down and sip. It's not HARD to drink, but this is not a guzzler. I didn't trade for this one, but I'm told it's priced pretty affordably, which makes it more attractive in my book. I prefer the West Coast style more, though, so I don't know if I'll seek a lot of this out in the future. But I do like it. 1,542 charactersArbitrator, Jun 03, 2010
4.25/5  rDev -4.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Poured into Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass
A - Light orange to copper and clear, with a moussy off white head that hangs around for about a minute. Leaves lace on the side of the glass.
S - Fresh, fresh fresh hops escape immediately after opening the can. Could easily smell the hops from three feet away just from the can. Hops scream when poured in the glass. Grassy, woody citrusy hops that smell fresher than any wet hopped ale I've ever had. Slight sweetness behind the hops to remind me that there may be some malt in the glass too. A light bready malt aroma, but I think some of the sweetness may actually be the alcohol. The aroma definitely warns you about what is to come.
T - Complex hop profile. Taste starts out with a woody/grassy hop flavor, followed by some grapefruit, followed by orange/tangerine which comes out just as the sweet malt flavor shows itself. Light bready malt; just enough to keep the hops in check. Very firm hop bitterness that disappears relatively quickly after consuming. Either that or my tongue went numb. Sweet caramel hangs around a little longer than in most DIPAs I've had, and a little longer than I'd prefer.
M - Light bodied and moderate carbonation make for a very smooth drinking beer. Warmth from the alcohol apparent even 1/3 way through the glass, which is the only thing to remind me this isn't a session beer.
D - Surly does a great job again with this beer. This is easily one of the best DIPAs I have ever had. What I love about it is that the hops are so fresh and has such a variance of aroma and flavor. There is too much caramel malt flavor in this beer for my tastes, which is the major knock I have against this beer. Next time I'm going to Minnesota, I'm loading up my car with this. 1,749 charactersbevenson, Jun 03, 2010
4.48/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5An extremely flavorful hopped IPA with a candied citrus flavor balanced with light grasses and spruce. Still, the bittering is smooth and quite gentle.
The Abrasive Ale begins with a brightly colored medium copper glow. A basic white head forms on the beer from the steady stream of carbonation below. Retention is great along with lacing and mild legging. Only a slight haze keeps the beer from complete brightness.
Vibrant aromas orange peel, ruby red grapefruits, lemon grass, pineapple, and other tropical/citrus fruits all dominate the nose of the beer in smooth and mouth-watering fashion. A subtle yet firm maltiness hides in the shadows and only provides the structure for the otherwise hop-strong aromas.
Flavors are once again dominated by hops- all of the tropical-citrus-resiny goodness displaed in the nose manifest well in taste as well. The confectionary malts act as if the hops were drenched in a sugary glaze and then consumed. Confectioner's sugar and mild kettle caramelization may be the only nod to malt sweetness. Decorated my rosey esters and a sweeter nail polish remover alcohol give added depth and power to the already aggressive beer. Still, the bitterness and harshness on the throat remain moderate and reasonable.
Creamy up front, the beer transitions evenly into a fleeting malt but aggagerated hoppy finish. The more and more the malts fade, the more dryness and alcohol warmth come into play. Eventually the beer ends with a malty-dry texture with the aftertaste of citrus and grassy hops.
Looking at the mostly clear beer, I can't help to think that this beer has been (at least) course-filtered. I would like to try it in its unadulturated form.
Thanks again Chickdighops! 1,715 charactersBEERchitect, Jun 02, 2010
4.35/5  rDev -2.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4A - Amber colored beer with a bit of red at the edges. Nice fluffy white head, left a nice bit of lacing on the sides throughout the drink.
S - Sweet, with a lot of grapefruityness up front. Malt backbone, nice hop profile that finishes up bitter but not overpoweringly so.
T - A sweet IPA, nice hop profile. Grapefruit taste that doesn't become too deep combines nicely with a bready, malt backbone. Pine notes are present but don't become overly piney, nice bitter resin on the taste, but not so much to be mouth puckering. Very complete hops taste that goes on nicely.
M - Medium bodied, good amount of carbonation, just a little too syrupy for me, but still very good.
D - Pretty good, not sure if I could session it, but it's close. Got through two from the tap with no problem. 787 charactersAgentZero, Jun 01, 2010

Very sweet, biting piney hops with citrus and tropical fruits bringing out the rear, smooth and bitter at the same time, sweet, like pty sweet.

Appearance: An easy pour into my DFH Off-Centered Ale glass, the beer is slightly cloudy and copper in color. There's a solid inch worth of creamy, white head that seems to erupt out of nowhere. The retention is outstanding and there's plenty of sticky, soapy lacing.
Smell: Yea buddy! A big hit of citrusy hops with just a hint of pine in the background, and surprisingly not a whole lot of sweet malt getting in the way. What we have here is the makings of a great hop-bomb.
Taste: Taste is big on the bitter citrus, mostly under-ripe grapefruit with just a slight bit of spice to it. This is a fantastic DIPA.
Mouthfeel: A solid medium body, but a bit weak on the carbonation. I think a bit of fizzyness would move this beer from being great to outstanding.
Drinkability: This is a damn tasty DIPA, one of the best I've had actually. Plenty of juicy, bitter hops without too much malt getting in the way. Sure, it could use a bit more carbonation, but even so this is really good. The 9% ABV might make it tough to pound all night, but I'd sure give it my best shot. Absolutely recommend! 1,199 characterskrisandajt, May 29, 2010

Nice off white head.... clean golden brew... good lacing... Looks classy.
Tons of fruity hoppiness climbs out of the glass and clings to my nose hairs... oily citrus zest and some tropical fruits... good cookie dough maltiness helps push the hops forward.
I was expecting an enamel shredding bitterness .. but instead a pretty balanced bitterness shows up front that quickly moves into a resinous oily mouth coating hoppiness... pithy grapefruit and maybe some passionfruit play very nicely with hints of caramel and thick malt profile.... finish is the wonderful fruity hops... man... this is a looong finish.
The body is a solid medium because of the residual sugars, but the carbonation helps strip it away thankfully... I normally prefer my big IPA's much more dry, but this brew is very well done and a lesson in "big can be balanced".
Reminds me alot of Racer X at least in my minds eye... Very nice and glad I got the chance to try this pretty fresh.... thanks a ton buddy.

4.32/5  rDev -3.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Pours a transparent amber color with about an inch or so of off-white head, leaves some nice lacing on the glass. Aroma of this one is really good--full of hoppy goodness. I get oranges, pine needles, some floral notes, a bit of alcohol, and maybe a hint of malt. Crisp and refreshing.
Big bitter kick from the hops to start this one off, with some lingering bitterness too. Largely piney in hop bill, a bit of lemon and orange zest sneak their way in too. A bit of spicy herbal-ness on the finish. Malt is present as a sweet aftertaste, caramel and bread. Something in this is really reminiscent of Furious, I wonder if this is a slightly tweaked double recipe of it. 
Full mouthfeel, a bit sticky for my tastes, ok carbonation. I could get through this a little easier with a bit more carbonation, which might lighten it up a bit too. Not terrible, just not perfect on the feel. A good drink--nice to have something that still tastes hoppy when I feel like I've pushed my limits on hops way too far. 1,003 charactersLordAdmNelson, May 26, 2010
4.1/5  rDev -8.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Many thanks to mymrrngjckt for a can of this.
Pours a clear orange amber color, and takes about a minute to set up, eventually resulting in a clear brew with an inch and a half of light beige head on top. Keeps well, with a full lace and some nice rings of stick as the level falls.
Hops are jumping out of my glass before I can even pour this beer, with big juicy fruit aromas of grapefruit, tangerine, tropical and passion fruits. Very fruity hop aroma. There is some sweetness too that combines with the fruit to give it a sort of candied aroma at times. Very nice.
The taste is no slouch either, particularly in the hop flavor department. So much fruit, like grapefruit, mango, tangerine and orange, etc etc. Very fruity with a good amount of sweetness too. Not really a caramel sweetness but more of a candy sort of sweetness. It's a bit odd, but I love all the hop flavor. I do, however, think that this is a bit out of balance, with so much hop flavor and so little bitterness that it ends up feeling not as clean in the finish as I'd like. Very tasty however, and I'd much prefer too much hop flavor than too much bitterness; the ideal, however, is having both in balance
The mouthfeel suffers a bit for lack of hop bitterness. It's medium bodied, a bit lighter than I'd expect at 9% actually, with a nice oily slickness, but doesn't finish as clean as it might if there were more hop bitterness. The palate is a bit tacky in the finish. 
I'm glad I got a chance to try a fresh can of this beer because it certainly did not disappoint. Although I think it could use some more hop bitterness, it's still quite drinkable because it just has so much hop flavor. This may well be a DIPA that you could call 'approachable.' A very tasty beer. 1,750 charactersnumber1bum, May 26, 2010
4.82/5  rDev +8.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Presented in a 1 Pint can with an illustration of a sanding disc sparking multiple hops. Nice. Poured lovingly into a Hennepin flute.
Pours a hazed tawny orange with a generous two-finger head that hangs for the count. Creamy lacing sticks to glass throughout session. 
Amazing aroma: Orange citrus with ample pith zest transitions into marmalade. Ah, marmalade. Strong presence of tropical fruits in the form of pineapple and mango. 
Ridiculously smooth and luxuriously creamy with prickly carbonation and moderate chewiness. 
My taste buds have just wandered into a tangerine dream. Tropical fruit goodness by way of Amarillo hops leads to impressions of pineapple, mango and, yes, tangerine marmalade. Wow. Bitter hop goodness slides right into sweet waves of caramel and brown sugar. High IBU announces itself, but is held in check by malt sugars. Caramel flavor yields to toffee and finishes with a snap of ginger. A little pine sap and we're into the middle. As Abrasive Ale warms, a lingering bitterness surfaces before cycling back to malt sweetness.
9% ABV is talking to me. My glass is empty. And with it, a little part of me. 
Truly, an amazing DIPA. A big shout out to Masala Mama for introducing me to yet another remarkable Surly offering. I'm beginning to wonder if this brewery is capable of brewing anything less than world class. 1,353 charactersCaptainIPA, May 26, 2010

A: Poured a topaz, golden orange. Thick head with very concentrated bubbles. Good retention with a finger's thickness of off-white head. Fairly transparent compared to other d. ipas.
S: Big upfront hop scent as expected. Fruity and floral, warm caramel malts do come through.
T: Cant name the type of dominant hop, maybe Saaz or Amarillo. Alcohol comes through, but is well balanced with the large malt bill.
M: Not too thick up front, but leaves a slight syrupy after mouth feel.
D: This beer is growing on me since I first tried it. I'm either in love with surly or think they are overrated and over marketed; right now I'm leaning towards the love-affair.

Pours from the can with a creamy light beige head. Excellent retention. Orange/amber color with no visible carbonation. Thick sheets of lacing.
Aroma is rather bold and quite fresh. Lightly toasted malt grain aroma behind both pine and citrus aroma. Some sweetness in the air as well. 
Quite a bit of fruit as well.
Excellent deep flavor. Very fruity, bordering on tropical. Lots of stuff going on. Frankly, not as Abrasive (bitter) as I would have guessed. Nice pine hop notes mix with the intense fruit flavors and it's certainly bitter. Earlier I said bordering on tropical...as it warms it becomes downright tropical. Just a sense of the ABV behind the malt sweetness.
Very light carbonation with an almost oily feel on your tongue.
A very nice IPA and one I would still like to try on Tap. Almost a touch too sweet. 961 charactersReagan1984, May 22, 2010

S: Just screams hops. A great hop aroma, but a bit of sweetness from the considerable amount of malt used in the beer as well.
T: Quite different from any other DIPA that I have ever had. Hints of grapefruit and pineapple and a nice sweet malt backbone. I'm usually not a huge fan of this much malt in my DIPA's but it works here.

3.87/5  rDev -13.2%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Many thanks to kbutler1 for sending a four pack of this my way. One thing I can say for certain is that the last time I had this (when it was called 16 Grit) is that is got me ever some drunk. Anyway, it comes out a clear orange color, without much of a head. Hops can be detected immediately upon pouring, giving off an herbal and fruity sort of hop flavor. I get notes of pineapple, grapefruit, mint leaf, and sticky resin. Very similar in flavor, with the sweetness and bitterness battling it out throughout the experience. In the end the bitter character has the edge. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy, and syrupy at times in light of the sweetness. Drinkability is great, but like I said before about my first experience with this brew, be careful, as it will knock you on your ass easily. Overall a pretty damned good DIPA. I am glad they decided to can this, as opposed to discontinuing it all together. Cheers 913 charactersjamie2dope, May 19, 2010
4.39/5  rDev -1.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25Update 6/28/13 - I've had the pleasure of consuming a few cans recently and this is delicious. I actually think a little age has softened the bitterness and brought out some really nice fruitiness from the malt. The bitterness is now not distracting in any manner, but blends very well with the hop and malt flavors. I've adjusted my score accordingly.
Very good looking beer. Full off-white head that settles nicely leaving lacing marks after each drink. Quite clear amber of orange-brown-gold.
Complex hop aroma with strong citrus (I noted orange especially), mild grass and unfortunately a "cheesy quality" that I note sometimes in very hopped up beers (Lagunitus sometimes and I've noted in my own DIPA). It's off-putting and distracting. There is a malt presence in the aroma too. Mild, sweet fruit like too.
The first couple of sips I noted a very appealing orange flavor that didn't seem to show much later. There is also a pineapple taste that shows up some now and then too. Very complex hop presence, but like the aroma it's a mixed bag with several very pleasant aspects and one flavor (see above on aroma) that unfortunately overpowers the so many good parts. The bitterness is apparent, but never overpowering. In fact in tends to leave only moderate lingering (in my mind unusual for style). Great complexity to the hop flavors and some nicely placed malt flavors too. No evidence of the 9% alcohol in the taste (but I felt it later).
Feel is familiar, as it resembles that of some other Surly beers. Lighter in body, yet somehow not a light beer. Carbonated well, yet not bothersome. As with other Surly beers these drink so nicely that it's deceptive.
There are so many good, dare I say exceptional, qualities to this beer, it's such a shame that the one flavor brings down and overpowers the best this beer has to offer. This isn't just a super hopped up beer. It's a beer of great complexity and great enjoyment with one glaring distraction. Too bad. 1,969 charactersgarymuchow, May 18, 2010

this is a pretty good, and very different tasting DIPA. very spicy in nature. lots of unique complexity with the hop structure. it teeter totters between sweet and citrusy to hot and spicy.
overall, in interesting DIPA. damn spicy though. 1,146 charactersbudgood1, May 17, 2010
3.95/5  rDev -11.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.5Pale peach colored pour with a resounding pillowy white head that rises and falls but leaves a steady, consistent cover across the entire surface of this beer. An absolute barrage of tiny bubbles continually dart towards the surface.
Smell is not what I expected from a Surly double. There is a heavy sweetness on the nose with some tropical fruits, peach, and a load of sugar. Not nearly as stunning a nose as Furious. In fact, it's a bit subdued.
While enjoyable, Abrasive doesn't necessarily live up to the name. It's hoppy, for sure, with notes of candied pinnepple, mandarin orange, and some tropical mango like flavors on the front end. It's bitter, but much more on the back end and even then, it's a tempered bitterness that lasts pleasantly but doesn't annihilate the taste buds. Strangely, this beer feels a little restrained, though Abrasive leaves a wonderful spotty lacing down the glass.
Moutfeel is slightly thick, chewy, and just a little sticky which is a bit of a surprise considering my only real complaint with Furious is that it can drink quite thin. Mouthfeel is appropriate for the style.
This beer does not drink like 9 %. A nice beer, but not quite what I had hoped for from a brewery that offers one of my favorite IPA's. 1,251 charactersBarrytheBear, May 16, 2010
4.42/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 16oz can into my Dogfish shaped pint glass. Poured a clear copper color with a bit of orange highlights coming through. It poured with a thick and bubbly inch and a half white head, but settled down to a thin covering after a minute or so.
The aroma has a bright tropical, pineapple, peachy, hoppiness to it. There is a bit of sweetness to it along with some bready malts as well. The fruity and citrus hops really steal the show though in the nose.
The taste is full of juicy, citrusy hops. It has the same tropical, pineapple, mango type of flavor the nose suggested. It finishes with more of a caramel and malty sweetness, along with more juicy hops. 
Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is very good, it was an excellent tasting beer. I love IPA's and DIPA's that show a lot of great hoppy flavors but don't show an extreme bitterness, and this one did that very well. Also tasted pretty light considering the abv. Excellent beer overall. Update 2/4/11 increasing aroma from 4 to 4.5 after having some fresh cans tonight. Loved the juicy aroma to it. 1,102 charactersbillab914, May 16, 2010

T: juicy hop candy. moderately sweet honeyed bready malts are perfectly washed out by the smooth hop bitterness. spciy hops dance down the throat in a long hoppy finish. tons of hop flavor in this rather than outright bitterness. not harshly bitter or astringent at all despite all the hop character. no alcohol noted.
M: nicely carbonated, prickly, medium bodied.

The aroma could use a little bit more strength. It smells fresh, but lacks the "pop" i expect in a DIPA. The hops contribute a clean fruity aroma of grapefruit/general citrus, melon, and pineapple. An interesting, wood and pine spiciness is in the back.
The taste follows with more hops than the nose. It's extremely bitter, and not just on the finish. You can taste the piney, woody hops all the way through, and the bitterness rides along with it. It's nice, but like the aroma, it lacks a fresh pop to it.
Mouthfeel is relatively dry with a high level of carbonation. The bitterness is the only lingering feeling on this beer. I was expecting a bit more from this beer after having Furious, but I still enjoyed it. I'm thinking this beer doesn't hold its freshness as well, so if I try it again, I hope it's right off the canning line. 937 charactersjeffthecheff, May 14, 2010

Oh Surly, you've done it again. Funny they named this one Abrasive, because this is one of the smoothest, most quaffable DIPAs I have had the fine pleasure to meet.
Looks good.
Pineapple candy and caramel grapefruit on the nose with some hints of alcohol at moments.
Flavor waves of juicy sweet oranges, grapfruit zest, caramel, wet dirt, and some pine sap and pineapple.. all with an everpresent drying hop bitterness that holds the journey together. The flavors remind me alot of Furious, but with a lighter body and a little more tropical fruit. Almost tastes like Furious morphing into Pliny the Elder (in terms of body, flavor, and alcohol). So yummy.
Great mouthfeel.. quite light and racy, while still providing a pleasant persistent coating of tingly hop bitterness.
Way too drinkable!
Seek this one out! 855 charactersDCDevilDancer, May 13, 2010
3.75/5  rDev -15.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3Presentation: Poured from a 1 pint 16oz can into a New Belgium globe.
A: Pours a rich coppery amber brown with a one finger thick off-white head.
S: Strong blast of citrusy and fruity hops characterized by an emphasis on grapefruit and perhaps some sweet berry notes. Light floral notes and sweet malts. A very pleasing hoppy nose.
T: Quite hoppy, as one would expect, but still seems to be off-set by a surprisingly sweet maltiness. There is a definite strong grapefruit hopiness but overall I found it too be surprisingly sweet. Finish is a light bitterness on the tongue with some sweet malts and lingering grapefruit-like hops.
M: This one is quite rich and almost chewy. Moderate carbonation going one here, pretty decent.
D: I could maybe get through two of these but not many more than that. Its a double-ipa so one would expect it to be a little tedious on the palate. 
Notes: Overall this was a pretty good double-ipa. I was surprised by the sweetness of the drink and that was a bit off-putting to me when coupled with the intense hoppiness: it definitely influenced the drinkability of the beer. In the end I don't think I would buy this one again, for the price ($16 for four cans) it just didn't seem worth it for this double-ipa which didn't particularly 'wow' me in any way. 1,295 charactersSoilworker, May 13, 2010

The head is white, I think it is dropping because of the hotel glass it is in. The smell is awesome, orange rind, pine, grassy, a hint of biscuit, when I opened the can I smelt it from about a foot away. The taste is very good, first some orange sweetness, then a little malty sweetness, a slight bitterness, then more piney bitterness, and then a clean almost refreshing ending. The mouthfeel is a bit light, and the ending is kind of refreshing, really not expected in DIPA, but that gives it an exceptional rating for drinkabiity. 593 charactersorsulacp, May 12, 2010
4.97/5  rDev +11.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Appearance: all Surly beers are bottled in cans (if that that makes sense?) Purchased fresh refrigerated 4-pack brewery-dated less than a week prior to pouring into a double-walled pint glass. A tad lighter in colour than expected, nice thick tall foamy head when aggessively poured (and how else should you pour something called "Abrasive"?) into double-walled pint glass.
Smell: Ka-blammo! A GREAT big fresh juicy fruity/piney nose, mouthwatering Pavlov's dog effect just smelling it, one of best ever held to proboscis. "Pliney got nothing on this one" ran through my head as I inhaled the luxurious aroma. 
Taste: A superb new benchmark DIPA: on first gulp overwheminging flavours and aromas that encircle your head like wreath. Huge albeit balanced flavours of zingy grapefruit, orange rind, crushed pine needles and toasted caramelly malt - super fresh full-on hops on top of a rich but perfectly restrained malt backbone. And blessedly, not too sweet. 
Mouthfeel: Surprisingly smooth in mouthfeel, much smoother than Furious. Very full rich viscousness, almost "chewy"... resolving to a long deliciously smooth bitter finish.
Drinkability: After the first long quaff my eyes were spinning in their sockets like a jackpot on a Las Vegas slot machine. A bottomless chasm of full-on DIPA deliciousness in a pint glass - over-the-top-hopped "West coast-style" pushed to an ultimate conclusion. And from Minnesota 'fer gosh sakes. Hop nirvana for lovers of the DIPA genre. Only caveat: due to the deceivingly smooth drinkability factor the 9% ABV is easily forgotten - only to be remembered several hours later upon waking up on the couch surrounded by empty cans. Cheers! 1,678 charactersPaulny, May 11, 2010

Beer is amber and clear (nice) with a monster white / yellow head of medium and large bubbles that leaves a monster amount of lacing on the glass. Carbonation is criminally low though...
Aroma is ridiculously hoppy. Lots of nice plne hops in there. Smells great.
Lots of body in this one. Some malt in the for front. Not quite what I was expecting, I'll take another taste, sweetness up front and a strong bitterness in the back. Beer is pretty good. There isn't much happening in the front of the palate. Overall its a pretty good but not as good as I hoped. 649 charactersdrabmuh, May 09, 2010

Great pine and floral hops that don't quit. Beautiful. Taste is more pine and some citrus and floral hops, a reasonable malt and caramel presence that balance it a bit. Good drinkability, but having it in close proximity to Barle3y Brown's Chaos and Alpine Duet make it dwarf a bit. Very good, not EPIC. 389 characterssquaremile, May 09, 2010

A: Gentle pour yields a foamy, 2.5 finger white head with great retention. Beer is a clear, bright orange that reveals massive carbonation. Lacing is patchy and stringy but not outrageous. Stick is decent but by no means endless. 
S: Pine, honey, toffee, bitter grapefruit, hops, and earth. Nose is rather subdued and a bit disappointing to be honest. I expected something more like Furious, a bit more over-the-top. 
T: Tea leaves, toasted caramel, pine, grass, overwhelming citrus in the middle. Bready almost, astringency comes forward towards the end as well as a decent dose of booze. Hop and malt presence in perfect balance albeit I can tell the battle rages on in this brew and a different side is winning at the beginning, middle, and end. Finish is super-clean for an IPA this powerful. Leaves a tiny, burnt hop aftertaste. 
M: Medium bodied, good carbonation, and moderately coarse. Abrasive is a good name for this beer as it describes the feel almost perfectly. Very lively and really socks it to my tongue. Finish is clean, aftertaste is minimal. 
D: Seems like Surly can do no wrong. Give me their brown ale, their IPA, their bitter, their RIS, it doesn't matter, they just seem to craft the perfect beer every time. Worth every bit of recognition it gets, Abrasive leaves me saying "Pliney the what?" 1,398 charactersSpeedwayJim, May 07, 2010

A cold CAN enjoyed in a snifter courtesy of largadeer, thanks Chris! I've been wanting to try this since the time it was called 16 Grit. Now I CAN. The beer is vibrant and translucent tangerine with a small frothy white head.
The aroma boasts a hefty citrus profile, with notes of fresh oranges, fresh peaches, fresh nectarines, fresh tangerines, fresh pineapple, and two day old papaya (perhaps after sitting on the counter for one day, and in the fridge another). There's a light malt sweetness that lends a subtle candied quality to the fruit, evoking an air of restrained balance. Many hoppy beers possess notes of grapefruit and orange, and but it's not often that I find those oft found fruits in subjugation to lesser seen fruits like papaya, peach, and nectarine. This aroma is exceptional.
The flavor displays a nice balance between hops lightly sweet malt, but the hops are certainly the center of attention. The trend of excellence I witnessed in the aroma is continued, with a bloated cornucopia of fruit flavors, including peach, nectarine, mango, orange, and grapefruit. Bitterness is at a pleasant upper moderate level. If I didn't know the ABV of Abrasive Ale I'd guess it at around 9%. The alcohol isn't masked, but its presence isn't detrimental to the great fruit flavor. The finish is long and bitter with lingering tropical notes.
The beer is medium bodied with an ample level of medium carbonation and a smooth mouthfeel. An excellent Imperial IPA with a huge fruit profile that I'm very glad I was able to try. Highly recommended. 1,567 charactersHopHead84, May 07, 2010

S: A blast of fresh, fruity hops. Tons of fruit, orange, pineapple, peach and grapefruit. A slight touch of pine.
T: Fantastically fresh tasting! Again its like a bomb of oranges, peaches and pineapples exploded in my mouth. Sharp citrus and pine hop bite with a nice thick toffee malt backbone. The balance in this is pretty amazing. Can't get over how fresh this tastes. Has a long juicy/fruity finish with citrus hop oils sticking around.
M/D: Just on the fuller side, lower carbonation, pretty slick and smooth mouthfeel. Goes down way too easy for being 9% abv since its so tasty and well balanced. Hard to stop drinking. 810 charactersherman77, May 07, 2010

S: A hop bomb if I've ever smelled one! Very reminiscent of Sculpin's aromas. A ton of tropical fruit, especially pineapples and mangos along with plenty of juicy citrus. No malt to be found.
T: The sweet tropical fruits are really the main attraction here as well. The pineapple and mango provide a nice sweetness, along with some peaches. There is plenty of juicy grapefruit and pine on the finish to give the beer a great bitterness.
M: Medium in body with a low to moderate carbonation and a really crisp finish to the beer.
D: I say it everytime I have a Surly beer, and I'll say it again: awesome! These guys really have a good thing going and I'm glad to have some more of this one in the fridge. 915 characterswomencantsail, May 07, 2010
4.22/5  rDev -5.4%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4A - Pours orange with some red highlights. Frothy, semi-rocky off-white cap that fades and doesn't leave much lacing. Surprising clarity.
S - First whiff is of pineapple and some other juicy fruits, backed with a nice dankness and strong herbal notes.
T - Follows the nose with lots of upfront juicy fruitiness followed by a mix of lots of herbal flavor, some pine, and citrus peel, in that order. The upfront fruitiness does carry through everything, though, and lingers in the finish. I can feel alcohol on the back of my throat but can't taste it at this temperature. The malt becomes more evident as I adjust to the hop flavor and has a nice toasted grain flavor, which is nice considering it's not overly evident.
MF - Holy full body, Alpha Acid Man! Definitely the most full-bodied, chewy DIPA I've ever tasted. Carbonation is suprisingly light, which provides a ton of silkiness. I'm not sure if I prefer this or something lighter, but considering the 'bigness' of the overall beer, I can only consider this appropriate.
D - Well, the feel definitely adds a lot of size and character to the beer, which is a plus, but it also takes away quaffability(if we consider it as far as DIPAs go). The alcohol is really well hidden, which is another plus. Honestly, the mid-west(or great lakes region) is incredibly impressive when it comes to DIPAs, and Abrasive Ale is no exception. 1,386 charactersHitokiriNate85, May 06, 2010

S: Aromas of booze, pine, citrus, green grass, and chemical solvent. Harsh without being off putting.
T: Boldly hopped for sure. Very much citric, with lemon zest and pith included. A bit bitter for sure. Hints of more sweet and resinous pine along with floral green hops. The booze is there, but not in too big of a way. The aroma says this one is hopped as hell and I am sure there is a ton of malt there trying to provide balance but it really don't work (not a bad thing). It is hop forward and pretty damn good to be honest.
M: On the fuller side of medium in body, fairly full for the style. Bold and bitter.
D: Not the most drinkable, but still solid. It is tasty and one I enjoyed putting back while in the pool on a hot May evening.

4.62/5  rDev +3.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Got a few cans of this from kbutler1. Thanks! I was able to try this beer a couple times last year in growler form, pleased to see it available in cans now.
Poured into a pint glass, Abrasive is copper-colored, clear and bright, capped by a finger of white foam. It's a few shades lighter than Furious despite the significantly higher alcohol content.
The aroma is outstanding. Redolent of peaches, pineapple, papaya and grapefruit, this is one of the most intoxicating and complex hop profiles I've encountered. Malty sweetness blends with the hops in a way that makes you think you're smelling a fresh fruit salad.
The taste lives up to the aroma, exhibiting flavors of yellow peach, mango and pineapple. Interplay between the sugary malts and fruity hops makes me think of alcoholic fruit punch. I can't overstate how fruity this one is, it's dominant to the point of overwhelming any other flavors. It finishes on a bitter but juicy note, tropical fruit flavors lingering long on the tongue.
Medium-bodied and neither dry nor syrupy nor overly bitter, I can't fathom why they would choose to call this ale Abrasive. It's a refreshingly unique take on the style, and one of my favorite beers of the year so far. 1,218 characterslargadeer, May 05, 2010

A. Golden copper color with a full, tight-knit 2 finger white head. Lots and lots of staying power and very nice lacing. 
S. Grass, pine and tropical hop aromas and bready malt. Very clean smelling.
T. Hopped up nicely with citrus/lemon on the initial attack followed by pine, sweet malt and some alcohol adding "richness". Lingering finish that has low bitterness. 
M. Full bodied almost sticky mouthfeel. Good creaminess where the head and liquid meet your mouth as you drink this stuff. Very nice. 
D. Not quite up to Furious drinkability standards though at 9% ABV it goes down awfully easy. This is an excellent beer but for $15 a 4-pack, I would reach for Furious over this if I had regular access to these. 799 charactersbound4er, May 04, 2010
4.47/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to Dan for snagging a few of these when they briefly hit the shelves. This is my last one. Served in a Kuhnhenn tulip. Some comments are cribbed from my growler review.
A - A finger of off-white foam appeared leaving some nice lacing, and a few bubbles starting rising to the top of the glass. The color is a hazy dark orange color. It doesn't have as much of the reddish tinge that 16 Grit did.
S - Loaded with fresh citrus hop flavor - grapefruit, tangerine, clementine and a touch of lemon - but also rich in sweet candied pineapple. A little more toasted malt character in the cans.
T - This stuff is pure juice - like fresh ripe grapefruits that I just picked off the tree in Florida and squeezed by hand into a glass and mixed with fresh cane sugar. Pretty fierce bitterness pops up after a few sips and lingers well into the aftertaste.
M - Incredibly resiny, and good thickness and viscosity. I can imagine hop juice coating the inside of my mouth. It's also a little warming from the high ABV. The carbonation is a little more zingy than the growler I had, but it's still quite pleasant.
D - Other than the fact that a couple glasses will leave me under the table, this is incredibly drinkable. No overwhelming bitterness, booziness, bloatiness - just deliciousness!
Well - I asked and Surly delivered. Not quite as awesome as the first batch of 16 Grit, but still a highly enjoyable and delicious DIPA. Hope some kegs roll down to Chicago. 1,462 charactersMasterSki, May 03, 2010

T - Magically delicious. If I tasted it with my eyes closed, I would have pictured it to be a green or purple cocktail ... it was just that citrus'y and sweet, accompanied with a nice hop bite that you'd expect from a DIPA.
M - Seemed appropriate; not too thin.
D - I want more.
General thoughts: I'm glad that this is harder to come by... that translates to when you do actually find some, it's very fresh and delicious. Enjoy. 566 charactersnotCreative, May 03, 2010
4.17/5  rDev -6.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Quite nice looking. A clear amber ale, a half finger of pale tan head formed on a pretty vigorous pour, not bad retention for what it was. Quite intricately laced, with a bit more carbonation this could have been more like eye candy.
Mmm things pick up nicely while enjoying the aroma of this treat. Some rich toasty malts with nuances of caramel and toffee are all but wiped out from the big hops blast. Some dank hop notes try to come out from under the blast of grapefruit and pineapple.
Yummy. Quite hoppy, with some bitterness. The malts try to assert themselves again, and yet again are wiped out by the hops. A dank earthy character morphs into a cocktail of grapefruit and pineapple accented with orange zest. Then a mostly clean bitterness rises to help in the transition from a hint of rich malts and full creamy body to a touch of astringency and mild resinosity.
Pretty drinkable. This is a big beer, the alcohol is pretty well hidden, but there is a solid amount of malt, and even more hop presence. If you are jonesing for a new, interesting IIPA this is for you. Another very solid beer from Surly, thanks to chonyr for the can. Hopefully they can manage to distribute some of these to Duluth, id like to buy some. 1,232 charactersdemcorhip, May 03, 2010

Aroma is quite nice and can be immediately wafted into the air with the pop of the top. Boomming pale citrusy notes of old orange juice, over ripe mango, pale pink grapefruit, and dulled pineapple. Bits of toasted and biscuit malt touch up some oddly pleasing bready notions, some notes to soapy dish rags, wet dirty wood, and deep earthy floral spices. Very Surly!
Taste is a muddeled concoction of dulled and dark citrusy things and underscored with toasted malts and doughy pretzeled bread. Its good but a bit weird as lots of darkened, raw, bittered citric hops of orange, grapefruit, and mango are mashed up and pulled thru a dirty old spruce pine cardboard filter while toasty grainyness softens and mellows out a tweak of earthy tea and woodsyness. The hop bite is more mellow in balance to its toasty malt twist. Fairly dark, ominous, and yes, abrasive overall to drink, crunchy and boldly bitten with a tepid dirty cirtic bitterness and snappy tone that speaks to the Surly nation in a twisted tongue of accpetance and power that'll send your tongue spinning faster then a sander with a 16 grit grinder on it.
Large, hefty, heavy, and bold body; crunchy, toasty, bready, dirty, bittered, dark, deep , and citrusy with a creamy induced backbone but man does that toasty earthy bite mix interestingly well with its dark citrusy bitterness.
Some very solid stuff that does its job as being abrasive to your palate. On-tap it has a notch better cleaned up drinkability and flavor that is missing from the can. Overall it definately says Surly and it definately says Abrasive! Makes my think, what if Flying Dog Double Dog, Sculler's IPA, and Hop Stoopid had offspring in glass. 1,827 characterstavernjef, May 03, 2010
4.58/5  rDev +2.7%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.516 oz can into an open-mouth imperial glass. Big ups to Mothman for the trade the night before Dark Lord Day! Thanks, Ben - nice to meet you and swap some great beers!!
Looks absolutely perfect. Orange with gold edges, perfect one finger head that's creamy and provides amazing lacing. This is really a perfect looking beer. Great start to this experience.
Smell is hops, hops, and more hops. Citrus and peach impressions from the aroma hops, with a touch of mint as well. Pineapple, grapefruit, and some nice caramel and slightly biscuity malt backbone. This has a wonderful smell, not my absolute favorite hops, but pungent and dank. Diggity!!! Although I must say other AD/IIPA's are a bit more expressive, this gives great scents!
Taste is really good, not in the exact same category as Younger (or even Elder or Dreadnaught) but amazingly well done. I must say again, I'm not totally the biggest fan of the hops used here. I *think* I remember reading this is predominantly Columbus and most noticeably Amarillo, and there's just a bit too much tea and peach notes to be my faves. But it's a really well crafted beer!! Nice malt backbone is holding up the flavors well. I like the West coast style, pale gold DIPA's with just a bit more viscosity than water, but this is really nicely balanced. Not too much but more than I normally dig. But this makes me question by preconceptions, and that's a really nice compliment coming from me. I like what Surly did here and I'm sure that certain hop heads would make this their #1 DIPA!
Mouthfeel is amazing. Creamy and medium bodied, sticky and not ruinous but intense feeling. Drinkability is great! I've only had a few that were this intense that went down this well. A fantastic beer from Surly. Thrilled to check this off the list. Now if I could only get another 4 pack ;) 1,830 charactersjampics2, May 02, 2010
4.79/5  rDev +7.4%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Sipping on this one as I type... poured from the can into my Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass with some good frothy white head with decent lacing.
The aroma is remarkably fruity and leads perfectly into a well balanced fruity/sweet/bitter flavor. This is an incredibly drinkable DIPA and is a VERY close rival to Hopslam (my other favorite in the style). All in all one of the best beers I've had recently - cannot wait to get more - this one will be a staple in my fridge anytime I'm lucky enough to be able to have it. PURE CLASS.
DELICIOUS and HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! 564 charactersthetomG, May 02, 2010
4.43/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Have I ever mentioned that pwoods is the greatest BA ever? Oh, I have? Well let me thank him again for sending this one unexpectedly. Love you buddy:)
Pours a warm shade of honey-caramel. The initial finger of toasted white foam fades only slightly and retains at a thick, frothy skim. Loads of lace swathes the sides of the glass. Beer is somewhat hazy, but the loads of carbonation bubbles seen within float continuously to the top. 
Nose is full of the aroma of juicy and sweet pineapple. Slightly bitter citrus and crispy toasted malt come through just under the sweetness. 
The sweetness from the nose carries over nicely into the beer with a strong predominant flavor of juicy pineapple. It can't, however, conceal that abrasiveness underlying the whole flavor of the beer. Super pithy-bitter citrus hops make it known that this is a DIPA. The malts are toasty while still having some of the sweetness of caramel. Feel gives away the hop-load as well, with an oily slickness that sneaks up in the finish, initially masked by the creamy, mouth-filling carbonation. 
Super tasty beer with a lot of different dimensions. Would definitely satisfy any IPA lover while adding a new dimension to the taste experience. 1,220 characterskels, May 02, 2010

A- Pours a orange amberish color. Massive 3 finger off-white head from a hard pour. This stuck around for a long time before dying all the way down. Nice sticky clingy lacing on the sides of the glass. 
S- Tons and tons of citrus-y hops in the front with a big dash of grapefruit. The aroma is insane with these hops. Light pine hops behind this. Upon second sniff I can make out the caramel malt backbone which in turn balances this out a little bit. Very nice smelling to say the least. 
T- Hop kick right off the bat but not how I thought it would be. More earthy style hops in the front of this (pine and almost a little floral as well). The bready malts come into play next and balance this out a lot. There is another kick of some bitter hops in the backend. The alcohol is faint for the style I thought flavor wise. 
M- Medium mouthfeel. Carbonation is good for the style. Crisp flavors through the entire beer with a little standout with the piney hops. Hops left on the palate and into the aftertaste with a sprinkle of caramel malts. Hop resin was left all over teeth, palate, and even on the lips. 
D- This was another very drinkable beer from a company that I am growing to love more and more with each and every beer I try from them. Do yourself a favor and pick this up next time it is at the store. You will be glad you did. 1,442 charactersalleykatking, May 01, 2010

a - Pours a red-amber color with two inches of white head with nice rentention and lacing. Moderate carbonation evident.
s - Smells of citrus hops, some sweet fruits, oranges, and smooth malts. 
t - Tastes of sweet fruits, pineapples, oranges, citrus hops, pine hops, bready malts. Quite enjoyable.
m - Medium body and low carbonation, very smooth.
d - I thought this was a very enjoyable DIPA, but it wasn't quite what I was expecting. There was a lot more sweet fruit smell and taste to it than I was expecting, and not nearly as much bitterness as I was expecting with a name like Abrasive. Great feel to it and could not tell it was 9% ABV. Would have again. 782 charactersmdfb79, Apr 30, 2010
4.35/5  rDev -2.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Can from a DLD trade. Thanks, random person! Pours to a nice amber with a perfect white head. Nose is very strong, and full of citrus and piney hops. The taste is a medley of hop perfection. Very fruity, like a succulent mango, robust with flavor but not as bitter as the name "Abrasive" would imply. I imagine the folks at Surly loaded up the late hop and dry hop additions to achieve this hop-head's dream beer. This isn't the driest of the style, but I think the lingering sweetness adds something special to its flavor profile.
This is damn fine beer. If this was available in Ohio, I'd be a regular customer. 614 charactersGreencoat, Apr 30, 2010

Reviewed cold from a can to a glass
A - Caramel color, 2 fingers of foam, nice lacing ring, carbonation present
S - Hops, citrus sweetness, orange peel with a slight malt backbone
T - Hops present, slight piney bitter after taste but finishes very smooth
M/D - Another tasty brew from Surly. Well rounded brew with a lot of hop presence but not overly power full. A brew that you can have more than a couple of in a sitting. A great representation of the DIPA style and it comes highly recommended. Try and get your hands on it since it is almost gone 575 charactersFreshmanPour77, Apr 30, 2010
3.53/5  rDev -20.9%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5Poured from 16oz can into a Duvel tulip.
A- Pours a nice blood moon orange that has a fair amount of haze to it. A nice one finger head that leaves a small cap on the beer and leaves some spotty lacing. Streams of tiny bubbles rise from the side of glass.
S- Not as big of a hop burst as I was expecting but decent nonetheless. More along the lines citrus hops, lemon and maybe a little pineapple. The malt is present in the nose which is less common in DIPA's.
T- A good amount of citrus hops but not tongue splitting. A little bit of pine and a good malt backbone which makes this pretty balanced. Also there is a nice bready after taste that smooths it out a little bit.
M- Like mentioned before, not tongue splitting bitter, so some might be disappointed. Medium bodied with good carbonation that might just be a little dry on the finish. A little warming on the way down from the alcohol.
D- A good offering that is well balanced for a DIPA. The alcohol really only presents its self once it warms and you are almost finished with the can. I was excited to try this at DLD but by that time my palate had already been destroyed. When I received a four pack of this I was a little let down. I think I will stick to Furious. 1,231 charactersWisconsinality, Apr 30, 2010

A: Pours a beautiful golden brown, with a one and a half finger, off-white, head, that sticks around for pretty long time.
S: The nose is fantastic. From the first whiff, I was extremely excited to indulge in this wonderful smelling brew! The initial scent is of sweet pineapples and tangerines. Following the fruit is some pine. Backing up the hop assault is a biscuity malt backbone.
T: Just like the nose suggested, tons of sweet pineapple and tangerine flavors dominate the palate. There is also a hint of tart white grapefruit and pine on the finish. There is very little malt backbone in the taste, but that's how I prefer it!
M: The carbonation is a bit lower than I would like. However, the lower carbonation does helps leave a creamy mouthfeel. 
D: If "Abrasive" refers to the insane amount of hops in this beer, the name is spot on. This is one of the best DIPA's that I have ever had, and I'm glad that I have seven cans left! 1,100 charactersaglose45, Apr 29, 2010
4.48/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Can poured into a snifter.
Pours a brilliant copper color with a white head that has great retention, lingering for quite some time.
The aroma is a bit sweet and fruity with pine resin and somewhere in the distance I can smell the caramel malts. Very pleasant.
The taste is excellent with lots of citrus and floral notes coming through, a bit resiny. Earthy. I didn't really notice the alcohol until the beer had warmed a bit more. 
Mouthfeel is sticky yet smooth, very balanced with the hops not completely overpowering. The drinkability is ridiculously good and I had to force myself not to have another glass, at 9% it would be a bad idea to try to session.
I loved this brew, which is what I have come to expect from Surly. Highly recommended for people not necessarily looking for a hop bomb (they are there), but looking for a well-balanced IIPA. 857 charactersRaymondMode, Apr 29, 2010
4.1/5  rDev -8.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Pours a glowing copper with a finger of head and a bit of lacing.
The aroma is a nice mix of floral and earthy hops. There is a strong caramel malt backbone providing some good balance, but making this not quite seem like a DIPA
The flavor is juicy with floral and pine hops, however they are not dominant and instead are met with a big caramel and bready malt backbone. The hop profile here is very tasty, but someone who likes their DIPA's to be pure hop bombs may be a little underwhelmed. I am not one of those people though....I prefer balance and drinkability as long as there is still enough hop flavor there to satisfy and that is exactly what this beer provides. The finish is bitter and resiny, and a lingering bready maltiness sticks around.
The body is medium and the carbonation is soft. Quite sticky on the roof of the mouth as well.
Overall I think this is a finely crafted beer, but one that does not necessarily live up to the moniker of "imperial"...your enjoyment of it will entirely depend on what type of IPA you prefer. 1,045 charactersalcstradamus, Apr 28, 2010

4.38/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 516 oz. can poured into a snifter.
A-Quite clear amber-orange beer. Bright, off-white head was huge off the pour with a slight orangey hue, great retention.
S-Huge, bright grapefruit-citrus hoppiness with a bit of herbal pine. Aroma is dominated by an immense hoppiness.
T-A big resiny-piney-citrus, in decending order of magnitude, is the initial wallop of flavor. Hop bitterness follows, which is predictably aggressive (dare I say abrasive...). Malt presence is there, semi-sweetich with some fruity esters contributing to this perception.
M-A little bit of boozy warmth. Medium body is full, sticky, with amedium-low carbonation. 
D-I'm certainly glad I gave this one a chance (and had a chance at this one, for that matter, since it flew off the shelves). Quite easy drinking, relative to its style, with a very enjoyable, complex flavor that makes me want to come back for more. 888 charactersCHSLBrew, Apr 27, 2010
4.52/5  rDev +1.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Been waiting for a long time to try this ever since I had 16 Grit when it first came out. So glad they decided to can it and distribute it.
Pours a beautiful amber orange color, completely clear and filtered. Lively carbonation and a nice off-white head sit on top with good retention and leaving some nice lacing.
The nose is super hoppy with floral and fruity hops. Pretty much all I could ever ask for in a DIPA. Alcohol is nowhere to be found, and it's kind of shocking (and scary) when you realize this is 9%.
Tastes wonderful, huge citrus and pine notes, with floral hops in the background. Caramel malts come out more here than they do in the nose, and it has more substance and body, and a slight tinge of alcohol. You can start to feel the alcohol as it warms.
Mouthfeel is about medium, kind of lighter than I remembered 16 Grit being, but that might just be a foggy memory. Sticky and hoppy, with surprisingly little bitter aftertaste. Goes down smooth with a hoppy bite. Drinkability is amazing.
Overall, I haven't decided if I like this better than the first recipe. Wait...did they even change it? Because it seems pretty similar to me. I'm sure they tweeked the recipe a bit, but this is basically the same great beer that I had last year, except this time around it's in a can. 1,298 charactersMistofminn, Apr 27, 2010

A: Beautiful pale amber body with a steady stream of carbonation rising from the bottom of the glass. Large, creamy off-white head composed of billions of bubbles. Great retention and significant sticky lacing.
S: On first sniff this was very reminiscent of HopSlam with large blasts of grapefruit and a honey undercurrent. With each successive sniff I got more pineapple, mango and tropical fruits. A dense vegetative component also started to come out, not so much piney, but like trees in the fall.
T: Very hop forward with lots of grapefruit and other tropical fruits. Good floral/green characteristics too. Good malt presence to balance out the bitter assault. Caramel and some roasted malt. In the end this is anything but abrasive. It is simply delicious.
M: Medium-full bodied. This is a big, creamy, resinous dIPA. Nice bitter finish that lingers just enough to give you the full flavor profile. 
D: A very enjoyable brew. Glad I was able to get a fresh four pack fairly quickly after the release. 1,052 characterscallmemickey, Apr 27, 2010

This is a great lookin' one. Pours hazy light amber with a nice-sized whitish head that lasts. Good lacing.
Aroma is really solid. Very citrusy hop profile - orange, tangerine, and grapefruit, maybe some tropical notes - as well as a little sweet malt.
Flavor is a little maltier than the great west coast IPAs, but still very hop-forward. Being from the east coast originally, I don't mind the malt. Big citrus, orange and grapefruit mainly, with some slight pineapple and earth. Just a little sweet caramel.
Excellent mouthfeel: mildly dry with medium body and lots of hop resins.
Very drinkable. A great DIPA overall. Hopefully Surly brews more of this one. 790 charactersnickd717, Apr 27, 2010

Big thanks to my MN homie, younger35, for the hookup. Poured from 16oz can into my GI pint glass.
A - Pours reddish/gold copper color with a white head. A fingers-wroth of foam disipiates down to a thin cap on top with some bubbles here and there and a thicker ring along the sides of the glass.
S - Big hops, sweet malts, citrus, grapefruit. Everything you'd expect from a big DIPA from Surly. 
T - Piney citrus hops with not too much malts. I'm so glad this isn't overly sweet. I'm so tired of DIPA's that are huge malt-bombs. This one has the huge hops with a nice subtle sweetness on the finish. Nice sweet orange finish with a touch of bitterness.
M - Medium bodied, light carbonation, crisp and refreshing.
D - A very well-done DIPA by Surly. Probably one of the best I can remember in the past few months. I only have a few cans left, but I'll make sure they're gone before it looses the wonderful hop & malt mix.
Note: I prefer this one to Furious. 1,003 charactersSean9689, Apr 26, 2010

Smell is highly hopped- earthly swirled with bitter malts.
Taste is highly transitional. Started with a flower flavor- hits me with a bitter sweet malt- then finish with crystal hops.
Finish is dry- the after-taste has a slight bite- but the hoppy after-taste lasts well.
Drinks great- with all the hops here and 9%- the smooth malts keep this very drinkable. 464 charactersThaBobfather, Apr 26, 2010

S - Hoppy, hoppy, oh, and more hops. Delightful aroma that filled the nose immediately upon opening the can.
T - Bitter, Sweet, Floral, and Citrusy hop goodness. Fills the mouth with that dirty and earth flavor that sticks to the roof of the mouth.
M/D - Mouthfeel is hard hitting and biting as we would expect from a quality IIPA. This is as drinkable as 9% IIPA's can get, other than the kick in the teeth, I could drink this all day. 581 charactersmwa423, Apr 26, 2010

A: Cloudy light copper color. The pour dropped a finger of eggshell white head that receeded to a thin rim and left great lace.
A: Very citrusy, not so much grapefruit, more of a light tangerine and orange peel nose. A nice amount of crystal malt backs up the big hop presence.
T: Big hop profile, citrus, some light grass, and honey sweetness. Malts balance it out some, but let's not kid ourselves, this one is a huge hop bomb. Finishes dry and bitter, just as it should.
M: Medium body and good amount of carbonation. Kinda tingely as it slides around the palate.
D and overall impression: Drinkability is pretty nice. Overall, I think this is a solid example of the style. I would have liked a little more malt to cut some of the hop bite, but, all in all I really liked this, and am happy I have 3 more cans. Skal. 928 charactersGtreid, Apr 25, 2010

A: pours a deep amber, gold, with fluffy white head, about 2 fingers worth on the pour, leaves huge amounts of splotchy lacing, nice head retention
S: the hop assault starts from arm's length away, this beer certainly challenges the hoppiest beer in a can claim made b y OB's Gubna... notes of grapefruit dominate the nose with other citrus fruits in there as well, smell is reminiscent of Furious which is a great thing! The smell is delightful. Perfect hoppiness with no overwhelming resinous character
T: the front features some caramel malts and juicy hops in the form of tropical juice...notes of orange, mango, lemon, and grapefruit, these flavors give way to a deliciously sweet malt profile providing hints of caramel and toast, the abv is ridiculously well hidden
MF: medium body, medium to high carbonation, everything works well with the beer
D: step aside Hopslam and Double Trouble, I have found a new favorite DIPA. The balance is amazing and the hop profile is assertive yet very palatable. This beer is damn near perfect. 1,232 charactershomebrew311, Apr 25, 2010
4.73/5  rDev +6.1%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured one into a Duvel glass. Light foamy head disappeared into lace. Appearance is like light maple syrup. Smell is aromatic with pronounced citrus and pine and also a savory umami note. Taste is hoppy pineapple with hints of umami (referred to in other reviews as a garlic note, but I think it's more akin to miso). Flavor profile is complex but quick. Clean finish for this style with minimal hints of caramel. Neutral hops at the very end. Clean and dry. The high ABV (9 - 9.7) WILL catch up with you. My opinion is that this DIPA is even better than Great Divide's Hercules. The reviewer suggests stocking up on this outstanding brew because the production date, as supplied by the brewery website, is April only. Outstanding! 732 charactersVonSteinhoist, Apr 24, 2010

S- A nice grapefruit,orange and other citrus type fruits hits you right away along with the aroma of fresh cut grass maybe some floral scents as well not a big pine smell like some of the other hopped up beers.
T- Taste is a lot like the aroma lots of citrus fruit taste grapefruit,orange but with some of the malt coming through to balance the hops.
MF- Dry, a little pucker power some carbonation clean finish no aftertaste.
D- Great ale very refreshing, a beer you sit down pour into a glass watch the Twins and enjoy, because of the 9% abv a pint is just right, Surly another great reason to live in Minnesota. 787 charactersFitzgerald, Apr 24, 2010

A: Its a rich amber color, with good transparency and lots of rising carbontion. The head pours pretty thick at an inch and a half but leaves nice rings as it fades.
S: I could smell it as soon as i opened the can! A whirlwind of tropical fruit is present, mango, papaya, pineapple, some apricot and peach notes are present as well. There is also a nice caramel sweetness in the background.
T: Did i mention this one has tropical fruit going on. its like i just bit into a ripe papaya that had an orgy with a mango, peach and pineapple while the creepy grapefruit was slightly bitter that it had to watch in the background. There is also a nice bready malt profile present which provides some balance
M: The body is on the thicker side and there is a tough of heat. Some roughness in the feel as well.
D: Another winner from surly that I would like to add to my regular rotation of brews. I couldnt give this a five because of the abv and i think furious is vastly more drinkable, but this is a stellar brew that I plan to trade for regularly. 1,084 charactersmikey711, Apr 23, 2010
2.93/5  rDev -34.3%look: 3.5 | smell: 3 | taste: 3 | feel: 3 |  overall: 2.5A-Tan colored..
S-Interesting give and take between the juicy tropical fruits (pineapple. papaya, mango), and the garlicy characteristics I associate with the Summit hop. There is also a floral aspect to this as well. I like the floral and tropical fruits....not so much the garlic, but Summit is one of my least favorite hops.
T-Really unabrasive...the garlic hits strong as does the floral dimension on the taste...not much for bitterness and only a smattering of the tropical fruits I noticed on the aroma...malt choice works well.
M-Not immense but DIPAish...a little grapefruit rind like bitterness on the finish but this is nothing like I expected it to be from the bitterness standpoint.
D-I'm glad I tried it. I don't dig all the garlic notes from the hops but that is me. I'd take Furious every day of the year over this. One of my least favorite Surly beers but in no way bad. I had six of these and had them over several nights..they were getting hard to drink at the end...something just doesn't jive right with my buds...will never buy again...unless they change hops eveyr year or something.. 1,110 charactersZAP, Apr 22, 2010
4.42/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Pours a slightly hazy amber color with one finger of white head that had good retention before settling to a thin cap. Moderate amount of spotty lacing. Big hop nose. Aromas of grapefruit, pineapple, and other tropical fruit. Not much for malt and the alcohol is not detected. The flavor starts suitably bitter with huge hop flavor. More pineapple and a sticky, resiny pine flavor. Some malt sweetness enters the picture and quickly disappears leaving me wondering if I detected it at all. Anyway, the malt is not overly sweet but enough to carry the hops. Finishes bitter but no sign of alcohol which is quite remarkable. The texture is nothing special but the body is medium and lively carbonated. One of the better brewed DIPAs. Available in cans now so more people will get to enjoy this beer, fresher. 806 charactersmorimech, Apr 21, 2010
4.6/5  rDev +3.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5A - Light to medium tannish brown body with an off-white light tan head.
S - Can you say hops, well I can. And hops is what you get when you take a whiff of this baby. Pine, grapefruit and a hint of pineapple.
T - Moster hops flavor in a very well ballanced malty brew. This is a uniquely complex Double IPA that should be placed in the dictionary right next to High Gravity IPA.
M - Thick and rich feel completes itself with a noticeably sticky finish.
 ~ This is a great Double IPA that I will find a hard time matching. I will definitely seek out more than just the four pack that was delivered to my door by my buddy, Mike Mittendorf. Thanks again Mike! 661 characterscdkrenz, Apr 21, 2010

S: Sweet grapefruit, hops, tropical fruit, more hops.
T: Grapefruit and honey at the front, this beer is hopped through and through. It is as bitter as you would expect from a Surly DIPA, but it is not as abrasive as you would expect, ironically enough. This is a beer that is put together to showcase the hops without overwhelming the beer. I enjoy it very much, what many overzealous hopheads should have done with their DIPAs.
M: Slightly syrupy, interrupted by sharp carbonation. Again, what a DIPA should be.
D: A fantastic ale that does justice to the Surly name. The 4 packs are expensive, but I understand that this beer is expensive to make, and it sure shows. 804 charactersTastyTaste, Apr 20, 2010
4.64/5  rDev +4%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Poured into Surly Darkness snifter.
Pours almost a finger of beige khaki head. Color is a glowing golden orange. 
Aroma: I am smelling PtY here or what? The aroma reminds me so much of younger, but more floral notes. Huge floral hop profile. I can detect (yes this word is lame in a review) a fairly large biscuity malt profile (maybe some caramel malt as well which adds some sweetness to the beer). The citrus blend is also well represented in the nose. A big flavor. I dig it straight up. 
Taste: Huge beer. Massive amount of floral hops, but the level of malts is high to keep it slightly balanced. Caramel and biscuit flavored malts keep things going here. The citrus notes are hard to separate, but there seems to be a lot going on. I would have to go with mango and grapefruit.There is a level of sweetness in there that reminds me a bit of the sweetness in hopslam as well (very little, but a bit). Big hop resin going on here.
Mouthfeel: It starts out relatively creamy, not the level of bitterness that I was expecting. It is bitter, but not too bitter. As it warms, however, the bitterness comes out more. Very big body for the style with a medium amount of carbonation. Ends very clean with some hop flavor sticking around. Nothing sticky or dry which is incredible for the style.
Overall, Surly has done it again. I had 16 grit last year on tap and this seems to top it. It reminds me a lot of PtY, which I thought was amazing. This beer packs more floral notes however, which is fine by me. It is extremely drinkable and my can is going fast. My wallet is going to be hurting for the next couple of weeks as long as this is on the shelves. 1,658 charactersmothman, Apr 20, 2010
4.82/5  rDev +8.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured into tulip.
A: Pours a nice amber-orange color with a slight haze. Nice off-white head. Some sticky lacing.
S: First picking up piney hops along with some citrus; maybe some tropical fruits. Faint sweet malts linger in the background.
T: The pine and citrus join together up front; reminds of fresh cut mango, pineapple, and a little grapefruit. As the hop oils begin to bitter the sweet malt chimes in, faint caramel or honey. The malt is very sweet and was a bit of a surprise from the faint smell. The sweet malt works with the hops and continues the tropical fruit theme. Have not tasted a beer quite like this before. Delicious! 
M/D: Medium Body. Goes down slick and smooth. A bit resinous and chewy. Perfect carbonation. Slightly bitter finish, but much less than Furious. Very drinkable for a DIPA. Goes down smooth and fast, feeling the ABV later. 867 characterscamp0474, Apr 20, 2010

4.49/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Picked a few of these up to go golfing with, then after decided to settle in at home to give it a proper review. Pored into my oversized pint glass.
Pours a dark golden color. With about a half finger of head. The color is a lot lighter than expected. I get great sticky lacing left on my glass as the beer settles. The appearance best compares to a pliny or darker two hearted.
Smell is Grapefruit and piney resin up front with a few other citrus smells including orange coming through. Then I get a surprising sweet malt smell at the end.
Taste follows the smell, with a complex hop presence. The sweet malt is more pronounced in the taste than in the smell. Lots going on there with the hops, I get again, grapefruit, pine, orange, tart lemon, and a very strong sweet malt presence to finish the taste off.
The mouthfeel is good for a double IPA, not overly thick, but very substantial in your mouth with the big malt presence. 
Drinability is good, but there is a bit of an alcohol presence as it warms that detracts. 1,026 characterspdoran10, Apr 19, 2010
4.83/5  rDev +8.3%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Poured from a 16oz can into a glass:
Appearance:Poured a bright orange with a large slightly off white head. There was great bright color with a bit of evident haze while it was being poured. The head stuck around long after the pour and left plenty of stripes of lacing down the back of the glass.
Smell:Smelled like extremly fresh concentrated furious. Plenty of pungent pine foremost. There was alot of apparent grapefruit and citrus. Almost a tropical smell hiding behind the hard hitting piney hop pressence.
Taste:Tasted of resinous pine, with a slight hint of lemon and orange peel bitterness. Plenty of caramel malt and an array of mixed citrus flavor, probably best described as grapefruit helped balance this into a truly great brew I'd say.
Mouthfeel:Pretty clean, crisp, and medium bodied. Pretty sticky on the cheeks and gums, due to most likely excess hopping. A hint of sweetness lingers along with the fairly dry biting pine bitterness on the tail end. 
Drinkability:Suprisingly drinkable for the ABV and style. Very clean and crisp, more than expected due to extreme freshness. One of the most tasty, easy drinking DIPAS I've had. 1,152 charactersblackenmn, Apr 19, 2010

The taste is as great as the aroma. Orange, grapefruit, pine, pineapple, mango, and some sweet caramel malt combine to make a perfect tasting DIPA. 
Full bodied with nice carbonation. A very smooth feel, with a bit of a bitter aftertaste. Nicely done. Somewhat oily, and has a bit of a dry finish.
I wish this beer was available year round. It's that good. 570 charactershardy008, Apr 17, 2010

Smell is very strong, lot's of grapefruit and some piney hop notes with a sweet malt aroma there as well. Lots of glorious aroma in the nose, very impressive beer.
Bitter hop bite up front followed by a huge sweet malt backbone. Lots of hop flavor; grapefruit, pine, citrus and much more. The malt complements the hop very nicely. You get the bitterness of the hops followed by the sweetness of the malt, very cool.
Very full mouthfeel, but pleasant to drink. Bitterness remains on the tongue for minutes after drinking, kind of an off flavor though in the finish I just can't quite put my finger on.
Drinkability is amazing, I do not think there is a double IPA that is more drinkable out there. Another great offering from Surly. 917 characterspmccallum86, Apr 17, 2010

Before I get into specifics, I want to congratulate Omar and Todd for creating one hell of a great beer. This is my new favorite from Surly and will go head-to-head with Bell's Hopslam as my favorite beer... period. Kudos boys!!!!
A: Orange/amber with light lace on the glass.
S: To me: West coast citrus all the way with a hint of caramel/toast.
T: Hint of caramel and loads of citrus (pineapple)and grapefruit.
MF: Easy drinking with rich viscous hop infusion and plenty of "gravity." Rich and fulfilling!

4.68/5  rDev +4.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Poured from a 16 oz can into my Russian River stemmed glass.
A: Beautiful orange color with an off-white head that settles quickly. Retention is somewhat low, but lacing is excellent. 
S&T: As any hop bomb should smell. Citrus, some pine, along with caramel-like malt. Taste is intense. Pineapple, citrus, and some cedar like flavors. It's balanced with toasty malt, and some caramel. The finish is bitter, yet very pleasant.
M&D: A very full-bodied beer. Resinous, chewy, and full of flavor. This beer, despite it's ABV, is extremely drinkable. Price is no factor. A four pack of Abrasive would be very easy to consume in one sitting. West Coast? East Coast? No. This beer has Surly written all over it! It's one of a kind. 727 charactersWYVYRN527, Apr 15, 2010
4.33/5  rDev -2.9%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Serving glass: Poured from can into Nonic Imperial Pint.
Appearance: Mostly clear amber-orange with very thin white head and some lacing tendrils.
Smell: Sweet and tart tropical and citrus fruits, including grapefruit, mango and pineapple. Also, some light pine and caramel.
Taste: Strong grapefruit and mango which leans more toward the tart side than sweet. Hop taste is further augmented by orange, pineapple, and pine. The caramel malts are minimal but have a slight mead-like quality. Ends just slightly bitter. Certainly flavorful, but a little too tropical to be the best of the best for me.
Feel: Moderate carbonation, oily and smooth body. Slightly dry throughout but not all that dry at the finish.
Drinkability: Very unique and flavorful DIPA that just barely misses the mark for me. Still very, very good overall. 830 charactersbsp77, Apr 15, 2010
3.5/5  rDev -21.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Clear copper body. Wispy and light frothy white head. Lace is pretty full, as expected with a hop bomb like this. Aroma is very big on the pine needles pine resin thing. Which is good. Some grassy notes too. A little bong resin to boot. Flavor is all hops up front with a surprisingly subdued bitterness. Oh, it's there, just not as abrasive or raw as I was expecting. Hops give piney and grassy flavors. Alcohol hides fairly well under the blanket of hops. Medium bodied and lightly carbonated. Solid, if not spectacular, DIPA.
After having another tonight, after a Gubna, I realize even moreso that Abrasive is just not my kind of DIPA. I even notice some of that garlic and onion character, like their Surlyfest has. I'm guessing Summit hops. Maybe I'm wrong. In any case, this is decent enough, just not top of the line like Town Hall, Russian River, Hopslam, or Dreadnaught. 880 charactersBighuge, Apr 14, 2010
4.54/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Picked up a 4 pack of 16 ounce cans this evening, priced at $15.99.
The can design is great, I love the idea of the sparks flying from the grinder, being hop cones. Cool can guys!
Poured from the can into an over sized snifter. A semi soft pour produces just over an inch of off white froth. I let it sit a good while as my wife scrambled with my aid to finish the taxes...we have 2 hours till deadline. So yea, it sat for a while. 
Now with a solid collar of retention and a thin skin of cap.
Color is a mostly transparent orange marmalade. It almost looks like orange jello with hints at red and amber, glowing with a golden shine.
Aroma is as expected...Amazing. Very sweet, candy like with gushing fruity hops. Mango. pineapple, light citric notes, just terrific and not at all bittering. Leaving me with a very inviting, drunk on hops and wanting more feeling.
Some breadyness, caramel and malt showing through with a touch of apples.
Taste is fairly sweet upfront with plenty of malt, caramel rolls, sweet fruit, mango's pineapple. Then before you know it, the sweet delicate fruits and malt are torn apart by hops, no biting a little and creating hop havoc on my taste buds. I like it too.
Bittering more so now, I havnt tasted pine tar, but this might be what it tastes like. Pine, mild grapefruit, a good amount of hops, lets just say that.
Some leafy flavors too with a very mild mint flavor. Mineral water comes into mind here. You know that flavor in somthing like Aquafina bottled water that you dont get in tap water? Well that's the flavor that seems to come forward for me.
Also grains and malt, still present, even with the hop bashing. Honey malt, and cereal grains. 
Now I remember 16 grit having a bit more spice to it and alcohol presence was more noticeable, as I looked at my review for that. Well, I don't get that same spiciness or alcohol warmth. Very mild warming into the linger of the swallow, but other then that, nothing. Spice is mild with just a dash of cracked peppercorn as the beer, no swallowed lingers in flavor on my tongue. 
Hop biter linger too. 
Mouthfeel is slick with a fuller body to it, carbonation is just right, does not bite but is present, creating an even balance to feel.
Truely an exceptional beer! I completely forgot how good it actually is. Which is good, because it made me not miss it too much for the last year and a half. 
Must try before you die. 2,414 charactersBuebie, Apr 14, 2010
4.34/5  rDev -2.7%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Tried to quell the urge to hunt this down, but Surly is so masterful with the hops I failed. Picked up a four-pack at Blue Max. Happy to hear this is going to be around for at least a few weeks this spring!
Pours out of a black can with an apparently exploding hop on the front into one of my first pint glasses (Surly, naturally). Nice clear amber, reminiscent of Furious. The hops relay out of the can & baton my nose even before I bring it up for a sniff. Ahhh. All that is good & holy about hops in one place. Pine, grapefruit, citrus, sweet. This is a sniffer rather than a sipper. One of the best smelling beers, ever. 
Abrasive Ale is a fine IIPA. The very first impression is of sickly sweet pine sap oozing down my throat; clearly the sweetness that came out in the nose is a double-down of malts. Sap & sweeet dominate. Citrus pokes it's head out of the den for spring time peek & vanishes just as quickly. Hop bitterness at the end is very mild considering the nose, before the sweetness reasserts itself like Jesse Ventura paying his tab fees. Alcohol blitz begins to assert itself after about half a can. 
M&D? Very thick & syrupy due to the heavy malt hand. Despite that, I find myself gulping rather than sipping. I have a sweet tooth. So sue me. 
Well, what to say? Furious is one of my all-time faves & I was hoping Surly would make a IIPA to outshine it (I know, I know, they're only mortal). This is a well-balanced IIPA vs. a hop-bomb, & I normally prefer the latter, but this is excellent. Grab it while it's fresh! 1,540 charactersmaximum12, Apr 14, 2010

4.24/5  rDev -4.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Pours a rich sappy looking amber with a small bright head and some chunky, slippery lacing
I could smell this at arms length when I popped open the can. Big orange peel along with some bright floral notes, tons of caramel sweetness and the alcohol blends with citrus to give off a welcome scent of pine.
The taste is full of orange, hop candy and oily grapefruit. Floral and aggressive with an enormous malty backbone. Huge caramel melds with the aggressive hopping to really balance this out. The bitterness rides the rail between the initial flavors and the finish and provides big hop flavors without mouth-fucking bitterness.
Mouthfeel is medium-heavy bodied, and the carbonation is a shade less than desired. Chewy yet slippery without being Aunt Jemimah.
Overall, mix Furious and Hopslam and I think you would get a similar brew. Easy to drink and potentially fatal with the lack of heat and high ABV. Good Stuff. 923 charactersBDLbrewster, Apr 13, 2010

Wonderful nose of piney citrus. Lots of mandarin orange, tangerine and pine resin. Light caramel scent as well.
Oh, my. This is jam packed with flavor, it is unbelievable. Massive hop presence leans towards the piney side, but still citrusy as well. Huge malt backing as well that adds balance and caramel and brown sugar sweetness. There is a boozy presence as well, but it isn't overwhelming me at all.
Soft and smooth. The fluffy head adds a velvety touch while it's still around. Between medium and full bodied. Finishes slightly dry.
So easy to drink, this one could be trouble. Surly nailed this one and I am so ecstatic that it is now in cans. An absolute must try! 803 charactersjera1350, Apr 13, 2010
4.65/5  rDev +4.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.516 grit didn't live up to expectations for me, Abrasive Ale did. Not sure if it's a different recipe, or if getting it fresh in the can is what I needed. Reviewed a day after released in the Twin Cities area. 
Orange/yellow pour, just a bit of haze, no sediment. Smaller head, but enough. 
Smells wonderful. A richer furious, but not quite the singular intensity. Still really good, piney citrus dominates, tangy and sharp, as you'd expect. Tropical fruits too. 
Taste is what I hoped for when I first heard Surly was going to do a DIPA. Rich gooey pine and citrus, infused with pinapple, mango, passionfruit, and whatever else grows in the tropics. Furious taken up to 11 after vacationing in the Caribbean and spending weeks in the weight room. Isn't that what you wanted? Yep. Alcohol pokes through, however. Take 1% off the ABV and it'd be better. 
 Smooth malt to balance perfectly, maybe Scottish malts as in Furious? Might get too malty /sweet as the hops fade, but I'm not worrying about that right now. 
 A full pint wears down the palate given the intensity of flavors, but who cares. Feels more than 9%, and it goes straight to my head. 
This beer is a tour de force. 1,185 characterscaskstrength, Apr 13, 2010

A = Nice rusty orange, light copper color to it. When poured produced a nice thin head that had a very light hint of orange in it as well. Head dissipated quickly.
S = Very hoppy, can smell the lupulin. Nice fruity smell to it, grapefruit and orange come to mind right away.
T = Lots and lots of hops but not over bitter. Grapefruit big time with the malt really giving it substance. Good balance of the two.
M = Decent but was really looking for it to have a bit more of a carbonated feel. Smooth though and very drinkable.

4.4/5  rDev -1.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Picked up a four pack at the nearest place to my house, Four Firkins. I've had this brew a couple times before as 16 Grit. Hopefully it's the same! Drank from my Guinness nonic pint glass.
Appearance- Pours a light copper orange with a beautiful one finger off-white head that is fluffy and nice. A decent cap and collar remain along with plenty of spotty lacing.
Smell- So fresh and fruity with a big grapefruit, pineapple and mango aroma that pops out of the glass. A bit of alcohol is noticeable but nothing overwhelming. Maybe a touch piney but it's more tropical than anything. Like Furious, it has a decent caramel malt smell that seems to be slightly more than I remember out of 16 Grit.
Taste- Big bite of bitter hops right from the get go with loads and loads of grapefruit and orange peel. Immediately after the big rush of hops a sweet malty undertone moves in keeping the beer from really being overly bitter. While the bitterness is certainly there, I think the malt sweetness outweighs it, especially in the aftertaste. The malt is full of caramel and slightly rich with a light grainy aspect. The beer remains fruity for the duration though as a touch of alcohol sneaks through in the finish. The sweetness lingers.
Mouthfeel- Very heavy and rich with a very light bite of carbonation that really adds to the creaminess of the beer.
Drinkability- This beer is a bit different than 16 Grit and I have no idea if that is by design. It's not as dry and the malt sweetness is kicked up a bit. That being said it's still an extremely good beer and crazy drinkable for 9%. I was expecting something along the lines of Hopslam (like 16 Grit was) and got something more like Furious (and that's a good thing). Another winner! 1,733 charactersyounger35, Apr 13, 2010
4.52/5  rDev +1.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Slightly cloudy golden-orange with a thin head that fades quickly.
Smell is plenty of hops, with some heavy fruit aromas, including pineapple, orange, apricot, and some lemon peel. The malts come in as a nice counterbalance to the hops and all of their associated smells.
Taste is again heavy hops, with the malts coming in a little more strong than on the smell. Good malt backbone that carries the hops a bit further, which in turn become more piney. Fresh pineapple and melon, with some more orange and lemon peel. Probably not doing this one justice; all I know is it's a stellar IPA.
Mouthfeel is right on for this style. Crisp, with a nice bite towards the finish.
Drinkability is very good. If I had to "session" a double IPA, I think I'd choose this one. The alcohol is well-hidden in both the smell and taste.
Nice! 824 charactersParrotbeak, Apr 13, 2010

M= Prolly one of the best parts of the beer. Really nice and smooth. Lower carbonation makes it really palletable and tasty.

A: Served a hazy, coppery hue capped with a small eggshell-colored dallop of foam. Small amount of lace was left behind and the carbonation was quite lazy.
S: HUGE aromas of pine, pineapple, caramel, and toasty malt all thrown in a blender with fresh-cut pine bough. Awesome!
T: See above. Sweet malt blends expertly with citrusy/piney hops, caramel, and brown sugar.
M: Sweet with a sneaky astringency that strips like, well, 16 grit sandpaper.

Came with 1 finger of tannish head on it. Clear copper in color. Really good thick lacing.
Smells of hops and citrus notes.
Tastes of hops, bready grains and some fruits.
Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with medium carbonation. 
Easy to drink this beer, pleasantly surprised me! 335 charactersThePeskyDingo, Jun 01, 2009
3.8/5  rDev -14.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4On tap at the Bavarian Lodge in Lisle, IL 5/1/09
Deep hazy orange red with a half inch of white head on top. Spotty lacing on the glass. Aromas of fruity caramel malts that intertwine with big citric and pine hops. Resinous and quite earthy as well.
First sip is semisweet fruity caramel malt that rolls into earthy hop flavors. Citrus and pine resins abound. Not as clean or vibrant a hop profile as I normally like for a DIPA. It flows down with a big bitter finish that is nice.
Creamy, chewy mouthfeel that goes down smooth and is fairly easy to drink. Overall, I found this to be a good double IPA, however it doesn't rank up there with some of my favorites. I was personally hoping for more and a brighter, cleaner, oilier hop profile. 744 charactersorbitalr0x, May 28, 2009
4.22/5  rDev -5.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5I had this one on tap at Stub and Herbs in Minneapolis on 5/12/2009. 
A= This ale poured a cloudy orange/amber color with a 1/2" white head. The head eventually dropped to a thin cap and left some decent sticky lace down my glass. 
S= Decently balanced aromas of sweet malts, citrus and pine hops, and some estery, tropical fruity notes too. 
T= Much the same as the smell, with the surprise star being the tropical fruit character. The malt base was a bit weak but it did throw out some faint caramelly sweetness. Hops were more citrus than pine. Bitterness was moderately high. Finish was dried and fairly bitter.
MF= Heavy side of medium bodied with an oily slick feel. Carbonation was fairly soft. 
D= Pretty drinkable DIPA really, though the flavor profile is not my favorite combination for the style. Absolutely nothing like Surly Furious though. 859 charactersspointon, May 18, 2009
3.85/5  rDev -13.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4On tap @ SL Binny's.
Pours a deep, orange color with an off-white head that leaves slight lacing all the way though.
Tons of citrus and pine in the nose and in the mouth. There are hints of melon and some slight maltiness too. Not too bitter and not too sweet. Just kind of mellowing for me.
This was a pretty thick DIPA, which I love, and that was the highlight of the experience for me. I had this on a warm spring afternoon, where this beer should have really shone. I have to admit I was a little let down. Surly is my jam, but I won't actively seek this one out in the future. Furious does me just right. 612 charactersrudylaw, May 18, 2009

4/5  rDev -10.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Had on tap at Stub and Herbs in Minneapolis on 5/12, a 7 oz. pour 
Poured a slightly hazy deep orange color with a half inch off-white head that falls to a skim and leaves minimal lacing.
Aromas were mostly of hops of course. Lots of citrus and pine, with a bit of a tropical fruit smell as well. The malt was way in the back making a brief cameo for a split second before the hops kicked it to the back.
Taste was quite citrusy with a lot of pine in there too. Resiny spicy hop flavors towards the middle combined with a slight tropical fruit flavor and light malt presence for a second right before the bitterness hits and lasts into the finish.
Mouthfeel was medium-full, slightly thick but ultimately pretty creamy and slick. Drinkable, but not extremely so.
I was hoping for something different from this I guess, but it was still quite a good DIPA. Give it a try if you get the chance. 896 charactersroadhouse, May 13, 2009

On tap at Piece Pizza in Chicago.
A: Dark amber color with a good white head and some pretty good lacing.
S: Lots of hops of the citrus/tropical variety. A good, sweet malt backbone. Quite balanced in this regard.
T: Again, definitely balanced with some caramel, brown sugar, and perhaps the tiniest hint of molasses. This goes along with the overriding taste of citrus and tropical hops.
M: Pretty creamy and fairly heavy without too much alcohol.

4.52/5  rDev +1.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Drank on-tap at Piece Brewery & Pizzeria, Chicago, IL
Served in a mini nonic
The beer poured a deep, dark, hazy, amber-orange color with a bubbly, bright white, one-finger head that faded to a clingy cap of froth. As the beer warmed, the chill haze all but disappeared.
The aroma was super hoppy. Peach and apricot notes dominated. Tropical fruits also came through strong. Brown sugar was noticeable as well. This definitely smelled like a sweet and balanced DIPA.
The taste was similar to the aroma. Sweet-ish caramel malts appeared up front. Citrus notes (tangerine, orange peel and grapefruit) took over in the center. Tropical fruits (mango and pineapple) were present as well. The finish was piney and crisp. Dry yet not overly bitter.
The mouthfeel was amazingly rich, creamy and frothy. Palate coating and cloud-like. Overall, super smooth.
Drinkability was impressive. The beer was well balanced and quite flavorful. No single aspect seemed to overshadow the others. Furthermore, the alcohol was hardly detectable.
This was a really terrific beer. It reminded me a lot of Furious on steroids. I was excited to sample this beer along with a "New Haven-style" pie in the Windy City (go figure!). 1,208 charactersDamian, Apr 30, 2009
3.8/5  rDev -14.8%look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4GLASS: Pint Glass
TEMP: approx 40 degrees [allowed to sit/warm for about 15 minutes]
Had this one on tap at the Tasting Room at Binny's South Loop location in Chicago.
Pours a deep orange with trace hints of brown. Almost copper-ish in color. Almost two fingers of creamy white foam make for a nice looking head. Retention is decent and lacing is spotty, but somewhat sticky.
Nice nose, especially after it gets close to room temp. Good citrus and tropical notes. Lots of grapefruit, some oranges, and a light touch of maltiness, but you have to look for it. Overall, it's a little underwhelming for a DIPA, but as far as a 'regular' IPA, it would be very nice.
Taste-wise, it's not even as exciting as the nose. Sure, the grapefruit and oranges come through. Yes there are floral and even some light grassy notes. There's even a touch of sweet maltiness to provide a little bit of balance and a bitter touch of pine, on the finish. It just comes across as 'not quite as big as expected' for a DIPA.
The mouthfeel was smooth and creamy. This is a good, solid, medium bodied brew. Could stand to be a touch thicker, to the style.
As far as a DIPA goes, this one is certainly drinkable. Unfortunately, if I want a DIPA, I'd likely reach for something else that would be bigger and bolder. That's what I expect from a DIPA, after all. If I were just in the mood for a 'regular' IPA, this would satisfy that craving, and then some. 1,433 characterscoldmeat23, Apr 29, 2009
4.16/5  rDev -6.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5On draft at the Publican in Chicago (the eve of DLD). 10 oz. goblet for $5. Waited too long for this to arrive from the server. 
Attractive hazy copper color. What was left of the head was present in the center and around the rim of the glass. Foamy. 
Perfume aroma. Clean. Soapy, almost a lavender aspect to it (may have been the fancy soap at the restaurant on my hands). In any event, not the massive malt and resiny hop aroma I would expect from a DIPA. 
Flavor was much lighter than some recent, well-reviewed DIPA's. Not syrupy and light mouthfeel. Both good in my book and cause for exceptional drinkability for a DIPA. Dangerously easy to drink this one (I think it was listed at 9.5% ABV). 
Plenty of random lacing towards the end of consumption. 759 charactersYetiman420, Apr 25, 2009
4/5  rDev -10.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5I have had a few of these and have a good idea on my impression at this point.
Nice pour with a smallish 1 finger head that stays until the bitter end on top of a dark copper brew.
Aroma is great, big citrus hop nose as well as a touch of carmel rolls.
Taste is hops up front, my only (small) complaint is that it is a little too bitter, and a little less flavor coming through on the hops. Citrus and pine dominate the taste with nice caramel malt to round out a touch of biscuits.
Mouthfeel is a little dry for my liking (which I do understand it to style), but not puckering dry bitterness. this is a very drinkable DIPA, but there are others I would choose over it. 669 charactersmnstorm99, Apr 23, 2009
4/5  rDev -10.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 3.5On tap at Brixies.
I had just had a bomber of 3 Floyd's Dreadnaught a few days prior so I was glad to be able to try this and compare the two.
16 Grit was darker and more full than the Dreadnaught. There was a bit more up-front flavor. The creamy, fluffy mouthfeel was outstanding (better than the Dreadnaught). 
However, the back-end had a much sharper bite on the finish. A little too much grapefruit. This was not nearly as balanced of a DIPA. It has slightly less complexity too.
In all, I would summarize by saying the 16 Grit Ale is not nearly as nicely "balanced" as I had hoped. Still a mighty fine pour, though.
Dreadnaught wins, but I do like both. 663 charactersPrinceDarren, Apr 23, 2009
4.13/5  rDev -7.4%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Had on tap at the Binny's South Loop tasting room. Very nice surprise to see this on the tap menu along with Undercover Shutdown Ale.
Initially, I thought: "Doulbe IPA from Surly. Probably just going to be a stronger version of Furious." I am impressed. This is not at all like their popular IPA. Surly always makes a great, consistent product, and the presentation certainly lives up to their reputation. Interestingly enough, this one didn't quite deliver in the aroma department as I was expecting.
The taste completely belies the smell. I realize that experiences can differ, but at this particular time, in my glass, sat a very intensely-hopped concoction. In terms of intensity, the only comparisons I could muster were Moylan's Hopsickle or fresh Port Hop-15. 
To use a trite expression ... the malt was there mostly for show, and to prevent the hops from completely rendering the taste buds useless. But they were there, and the flavor was something very interesting : Dark chocolate-covered ginger, and dark chocolate-covered orange peel. As odd as it may sound, that's what came to mind, and I think it fits. Rich. Complex. Spicy. Didn't get much caramel/toffee hints at all, and merely a faint whiff of the grapefruit/pineapple flavor normally associated with stronger DIPAs. None of the "furious-like" earthy dry-hops present in the hop profile, but definitely some pine notes there, packing a serious alpha-acidic punch.
Very unique. Intense, but balanced. Hoppy / gritty, but sophisticated and even elegant at the same time. I like it, but it's hard to wrap my head around it. If you see it - you must try it. That's all I can say. 1,649 characterskeithricker, Apr 22, 2009

4.17/5  rDev -6.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Pours a hazy orange with decent head. On the nose, hoooo, we've got some hops. Citrus and grapefruit are the predominant fruits I'm picking up. Wouldn't mind just sitting here smelling it for a while.
But it has to be consumed eventually. And it's pretty darn good, indeed. It's complex, but in a different way than the Furious, which seems to have a bit more balance. This one leans even heavier on the hops. It's delicious, but a definite bruiser.
One pleasant surprise is the creaminess. It's not crazy, but distinct enough to stand out. Interesting variation in the style.
Great beer to try and I'm glad I did. 617 charactersLarrytown, Apr 17, 2009
4.38/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Served in a large tulip glass. I never thought I'd be able to try this beer, but I guess I was wrong!
This beer is a glowing pumpkin orange with a nice creamy sort of rocky head. It looks quite promising. The head died down to a small layer about half a finger or so and there is a ton of sticky lacing on the glass.
I'm not getting as much from the nose, which sort of surprises me. I'm picking out dried tropical fruits and a little earthy hop spice. 
My first sip isn't what I thought it would be. There's a lot of sweet malt, but the hops are still reigning over this beer. It almost tastes like an aged DIPA that was re-dryhopped or something, quite interesting. The sweetness of the malt sort of sticks in the middle of the sip. The front has the tropical, candied fruit hops and the finish is bitter and fairly dry. 
I'm going to have another one and move onto something else because I can't drink a lot of this. I mean, this is a still a great beer and all, but my tastebuds are already pretty shot. 1,011 charactersbeertooth, Apr 14, 2009

A-Slightly hazy orange tinted copper with a thin light tan head that left nice lace.
S-Prominent citrus, orange, and some subtle spicy hop notes. Solid roasted caramel malt supports the rather hefty hop bill. A subtle hint of black pepper and alcohol heat sneaks in upon warming in the finish.
T-BIG citrus and pine hop notes paired with a solid caramel malt body. This is very tasty and I like it but...
M-Medium body with long lasting spicy hop bitterness and a bit of alcohol burn.
D-While I enjoyed this I was left a bit disappointed. I think the hop profile simply didn't work for me in the end as it became to spicy in the end. In fact this was overshadowed during this session by Alpine Pure Hopiness IMHO. 827 charactersDeuane, Apr 13, 2009

Bright orange body with slight reddish tint. Sticky cap of foam that clings well to the glass. Pungent and resiny hop aroma. Very citrus forward, and dank like the funky stuff in Snoop's pipe. If I had to guess i'd say Amarillo due to the heavy citrus. Edit: Citra. Body was a little light, with more balanced maltiness than expected. Tasted like Flossmoor IPAs that use Golden Promise malt. Firm pine bitterness, with some florals mixing in. Dry finish, with a tiny bit of sweetness that helps to savor it. Really nice hop showcase in this balanced DIPA. 675 charactersemerge077, Apr 03, 2009

A-Golden orange color with some red tint, 1/4 inch creamy white head, some light lacing at the beginning
S-Citrus including grapefruit and oranges mostly, sweet malt, grassy accents, Amarillo and Warrior in here for sure, caramel, and lots of oats
T-Starts off with a big lemon flavor, citrusy hops in the middle too that quickly fade into both toasted and sweet malts, finish is dry with floral and piney accents, caramel and sweetness comes out as it warms and that was expected, nice mixture of buttered bread and bitter hops
M-Dry, bitter, creamy, slightly sweet, and citrusy mouthfeel, thin to medium bodied, lighter side for carbonation but that was expected anyways
D-Alcohol is hidden well in this DIPA, could drink a good amount of it, balanced and not overly sweet or hoppy, smooth stuff that I was in a can, hint hint

S: A floral boquet of citrusy hoppiness greets the nose. Grapefruit is the main citrus component, but I get some other fruitiness as well. There is some faint sweetness from the malts. 
T: Hops greet the tongue initially, but not in bitterness. I get a vast array of flavorful hops. Grapefruit and other citrus fruits are present. I even get a faint floralness or grassiness. The caramel sweetness of the malts balance the brew out. I do get a faint hint of alcohol as well. This seems to warm this up.
M: Fairly light to medium bodied. Suprisingly creamy for a double IPA.
D: This is definitely a drinkable DIPA. Very flavorful, with tons of hoppy aromas and flavors. Not too heavy or alcoholic to turn you off. I could put a few of these back. I hope to see it in a can or bottle some day. 907 charactersbrewdoc75, Mar 31, 2009

Taste is very malty, way more than I expected. When cold, it's overly balanced toward malts. Not to say there's not a ton of citrus hops. Pine as well. Gets much better as it warms. The hops make an appearance and it gets a bit spicy as well.

4.03/5  rDev -9.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4A damn fine looking beer indeed. Deeply opaque, cloudy amber obviously unfiltered amber burnt brick colored.
Thik with bready malts showing both caramel and toffee accents. Hops are resiny in nature with a bit of everything, mostly earth, pine, with some citrus on the end. Nose shows good balance of malt and hop although hop driven.
Very good but the middle is slightly skewed possibly because of temperature. As the beer warms up it rounds out much more and the malt is much enhanced although still lacking in overall hop appeal really. Sweet malt very bready full of toffee with hints of caramel. Not as hoppy and bitter as I had envisioned and lacking an overall balance with the sweetness of the malt although not cloying. Hops are however sticky and condusive but just lacking a big alpha acid kick. Not sure of the hop variety or if this has been in the growler too long? It is reminiscent of a caramel covered hop. 925 charactersmcallister, Mar 13, 2009

A - Hazy amber orange with a thin tan head that quickly turns to a few strings of sicky lacing. Surprisingly dark for the style but a very nice cascading effect that reminded me of nitro pours.
S - Big juicy hop aroma, grapefruit, tropical fruits, freshly squeezed orange juice and a honey like malt sweetness.
T - Huge hop flavor and extremely balanced. There must be a lot of late addition hops to have this much hop flavor without a very noticeable bitterness. Citrus, heavy orange cream, grapefruit, peaches, tangerines mixed with honey, caramel and bready malts. A lingering hoppy sweetness stays on the tongue.
M - Medium body with low, dull carbonation creating a creamy mouthfeel. 
D - This almost reminds of an ESB on steroids with american hops. Extremely drinkable and tasty. 824 charactersbrewcrew76, Feb 14, 2009

Pours a surprisingly dark amber/orange. Good to see the growler still has some carbonation left, as a nice two inch thick head greeted me. 
One of the most tropical-scented beers I can recall. Crazy orange, tangerine, sweet grapefruit, and guava pop on the tongue. The taste is explosive, really nice. Almost no bitterness, just a light cascade of IBUs that create a slow burn. The heat builds up as you drink it, but it's not going to blow you away. It's really more fruit/tropical than almost any other IPA/DIPA/TIPA I've had. Only Sculpin and aged Stone 10th anniversary come to mind.
Nice sticky, chewy mouthfeel. Unbelievably drinkable. 809 charactersOverlord, Feb 07, 2009

Growler shared among friends while on a skiing trip in Vermont. Poured into a pint glass and appears as an orange amber brew with a haze (chill haze maybe?) This growler was from the release and after much travel still had a very lively head. Much lacing and stickage down the glass.
Smell is phenomenal. Ripe tropical fruit carrys throught the whole smell. Some citrus, but mostly big fat juicy fruit - very enticing. I can smell this beer all night.
Hop character hits fast and quick but is immediately pulled in check by a huge sweet malt bill. There is some earthy pineness in the taste IMHO takes a back seat to the malts. The malts make this brew wet, chewy, and very drinkable. IMHO I think less sweetness would have showcased the hops more. I think of this brew as a DFH90 amped on steriods! Unfortunately, my taste for a DIPA is more on the dry side (ala Pliny).
An extremely impressive offering by Surly and it needs to be bottled regulary!! 1,037 charactersphattysbox, Feb 05, 2009

Slightly spicy hops in the nose and with some lovely citrus aromas. The taste is a perfectly balanced blend of firm, slightly sweet malt, pine, and citrus.

Sweet and awesome hops come out of the glass to start you salivating while you smell the beer. Tasted great, nice and hoppy with an awesome sweetness to really nicely balance this beer. Up there as on of the best IIPA's I've had.
As the story goes this won't be available in Growlers any longer due to Minnesota law changing, sad if it's true and made us toast to one of the last Surly 16 Grit growlers to be consumed. 520 charactersDubbercody, Jan 30, 2009

Thanks to PhiDelt for this one!
A. Hazy burnt gold..not much head. Oily, thick, and sticky is the way this one looks. 
S. Caramel, oranges, peaches, resiny-sticky hop oils. 
T. Very malty and sweet with molasses overtones but well bittered to keep up. Honey malt and light alcohol warming is present. Very sticky and oily hops. Earthy, dirt-y and complex. 
M. Thick in the mouth and low carbonation. 
D. Nice beer. I wish this one was a regular in their canned lineup. Super drinkable even so sweet and bitter. 551 charactersMMAJYK, Jan 27, 2009

A: Golden Red color, good lacing 
S: Tropical fruits and citrus, caramel notes and just a creamy taste to it.
T - Wonderfly bitter, warming...truely Furious on steriods. But the blend of hops made the taste just flow.
M - full bodied, even carbonation, The carbonation doesnt slow you down though.
D - got a little depressed after the growler was gone. But I hope that Surley will start canning this beer. It is fantastic! 628 charactersNuBrewm, Jan 27, 2009

A - Poured a hazy orange/copper-colored body with minimal carbonation and a thin beige head that yielded nice lacing.
S - Fruity hop nose with citrus notes (especially orange) and berry sweetness combined with a burnt caramel malt character. Some piney notes and spicy black pepper also emerge, as well as a mild waft of alcohol. 
T - Huge hop explosion with citrus and pine notes paired with an alcohol warmth and caramel malt sweetness. Some floral notes peek through in the backend. 
M - Medium bodied with a syrupy texture and pretty soft carbonation. Dry finish with an assertive bitterness on the palate.
D - much like Furious, this is a big, bold DIPA with tons of hops and a noticeable alcohol presence. While it is very good, I still haven't been blown away by anything from Surly yet. This one fell a little short of my expectations, but it was still quite good overall. 964 charactersffejherb, Jan 26, 2009

4.6/5  rDev +3.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Who brings a growler of DIPA to a Stout Tasting party? Skourtis, that's who! Big thanks to Theo for sharing his bounty and thanks to the MN trader who sent this along. I tried 16 Grit twice last night and was fortunate enough to get 10-12 oz. more today (benefits of hosting said party). Poured to a pint glass.
A: Pours a warm auburn orange with a sultry haze. Even 24 hours after first opening, I still get a nice 1-finger layer of frothy ivory, impossibly slow to fade. Lace coats in sudsy bands.
S: Delicious-smelling candy-like aroma: syrupy sweet caramel, mild grasses and herbs, fruity notes of tangerine and orange. Rises cautiously from the glass after an initial burst at first pour: any stronger and it gets a '5'.
T: Huge malty mouthful: sweet citrus melds beautifully with grassy/herbal and slightly spicy hops. Toasted bread crust, a little nutty. Wheat bread spicing with a few softer fruit notes (melon and pear). Some in the group we tasted with likened the flavors to the best 'English IPA' any of us had tried.
M: Luscious carbonation, smooth and lightly coating feel. Not too sweet nor too sticky, has a wonderfully balanced blend of sugars and bitterness. Medium body, no notable alcohol but for a slight, cheek-drawing warmth. Mouth-watering for more.
D: As balanced an IPA as I can recall having. Malts and hops blend superbly, alcohol seems non-existent. A beer that nears perfection on many levels, and one I deeply regret I'll probably never get to have again. 1,491 charactersmsubulldog25, Jan 18, 2009
4.33/5  rDev -2.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5This is another fantastic Surly offering. Appearance is very good, a nice orange hazy color with a decent head and lots of oily lacing. Smell was quite good, a nice blast of fresh hops- very complex hop character here. Also a slight bit of spice and grapefruit. My one qualm with the beer is that the taste does not blast me quite as hard as the smell. Mouthfeel is great, oily and moves around well on the palate. Drinkability is fantastic for a DIPA. 452 characterssupercolter, Jan 18, 2009
4.47/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Many, many thanks to turdfurgison for his generosity in sharing the growler. Very much appreciated. 
Appearance: It's a hazy, caramel color with a bit of an orange tint. Very nice looking color. The head appears to be a vanilla color, but carbonation is very light and it barely covers the surface. Needless to say, retention was very short and only a few specks of lace remained behind.
Smell: The nose is very impressive. It's very fruity and sweet smelling. The fruits are ostensibly attributable to the citric hops. I don't know what the hop bill is, but they certainly smell strong, citric, and delicious. Smells like there's a generous amount of malts included. But the hops retain their strong scent. Not sure if that holds true for the flavor profile, but here's hoping it does. Much to my delight, absolutely no alcohol is noted. Impressive for a 9% beer. Very nice smelling beer.
Taste: This is very impressive. Initially, there's a load of citrus grapefruit and pineapple flavor. Very sweet and satisfying. Caramel and pale malts are noted. Caramel tastes like the stronger of the two. Generally, I'm not a big fan in the style, but it works out well here. Hops are primarily citric and provide a really nice bitter flavor. The bitter flavor is not quite as strong as it could be due to the malt presence, but it really does have a nice flavor that doesn't want for much at all. Very satisfying. Alcohol is only faintly noticeable. Another plus. It finishes sweet, bitter, and a little dry.
Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It has a nice, medium body that's very lush and smooth. Carbonation is very light. Just enough to keep it above flat. Very reminiscent of a cask ale, indeed. Drinkability is very high despite its 9% abv. It's got such a great flavor. If I had a growler to myself, I'd probably make a valiant effort to tackle the entire thing. It is that good.
16 Grit's one hell of a fine DIPA. I'm certainly grateful for the opportunity to try it. It's a shame Minnesota law will prevent Surly from selling any more growlers. Honestly, this is a beer that's well worth bottling from here on out. It's very impressive. It could use a little more carbonation, but that's about it. It's fantastic in all other respects. Thanks again, Eric. I really appreciate the opportunity to try this beer. The opportunity's probably not likely to ever emerge again. 2,366 charactersprototypic, Jan 18, 2009
4.8/5  rDev +7.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Terrifically turbid caramel-covered orange with juicy tangerine and mango highlights. The golden sandstone colored head isn't huge, but it oozes quality. The foam is firmly creamy and sticky, leading to both persistence and an extensive array of fine lace. This is a great looking DIPA.
The word 'great' applies to the aroma as well. The tropical fruitiness emanating from the glass tells me that Amarillo is the dominant hop (Warrior and Glacier are also present). An insane amount of hops and double dry-hopping just cannot be beat. Each sniff results in billowing clouds of orange, pink grapefruit and passionfruit. This should be yet another doozy from Surly.
Doozy is right! 16 Grit Ale may not be as abrasively hoppy as the name suggests, but then I've only just begun to gulp. This might be one of those DIPAs that is cumulatively hoppy and starts to strip tooth enamel after 16-20 ounces. 110 IBUs seems a tad high. On the other hand, it tastes and feels like abundant malt sugars are running interference and attempting to keep things balanced.
My preference is for DIPAs to have either no caramel malt or just a little. There's more than a little caramel-toffee flavor, but less than a lot. In the end, it works well in concert with the lusciousness of the hops, without overpowering them. The beer has 9.0% ABV power, even if the alcohol is barely appreciated on the palate. If that makes any sense.
As often happens, the flavor score has earned a bump near the bottom of the first glass. Warming is probably the reason why. The flavors are more intense and fit together even more seamlessly. This stuff is dangerously drinkable, as is most all Surly beer. Talk about liquid crack. Prediction: this will be one my 'top beers of 2009'. Easy call.
As the raging river of melted caramel solidifies the bottom end, an increasingly impressive hoppiness takes flight on the top end. Flavors mirror aromas, with juicy pineapple, orange zest and pink grapefruit being especially prominent. Maybe a little pine sap as well. Lawdy, lawdy, this big ol' hoppy ale is the cat's pajamas. It also comes in the best looking growler that I've ever seen.
The mouthfeel is pretty damn close to sheer perfection. It's lightly chewy, lightly sticky and moderately mouthcoating. I'm also pleased that the carbonation is laid back, yet insistent enough to provide lift and volume. Kudos to both the brewer (Todd) and the sender (Al).
The temperature outside was -16 degrees when I got up this morning. Coincidence? 16 Grit Ale is yet more proof that Surly can stand toe to toe with America's best breweries and not blink. This beer is a remarkable achievement and deserves to released each and every year. A million thanks to the felonious one for coming through again. Your generosity is humbling. Finally... hoppy birthday to me! 2,826 charactersBuckeyeNation, Jan 15, 2009
4.85/5  rDev +8.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured from a growler gifted from JohnBierman as an extra in a trade (!). I'm finishing my second pint, and I'm seriously loving this beer. John told me it was filled from the bright tank, not kegged first. It could be this is the reason it feels like a cask ale, it has an English "real ale" body but with massive American hops flavors. The beer is dark copper colored, clear, with a thin white foam. The smell is wickedly good, way better than Furious which smells a lot more like cat piss (I'm not knocking it, it's just the dominant aroma in Furious). I don't really get the feline urine in 16 Grit, mostly the hops come through as grapefruit and pine sap. The taste is stunning, I really don't know how it could be improved. The hops dominate with citrus flavors but there's a malty sweet counterbalance that keeps things interesting taste-wise. The body is stunning too, very "casky". Probably this is my favorite DIPA at this point, and it's really sad that I'll never see it again after this growler dies. 1,013 charactersTurdFurgison, Jan 15, 2009
5/5  rDev +12.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Wow...the other reviewers did a great job with a more technical analysis. All I can say is that this is the best DIPA I've ever had. Big citrusy (orange?) DIPA balancing the malt and bitterness. I swear this beer tastes better because I can't buy another growler.
The only time I got up to the Surly Brewery was to buy this growler and due to archaic law, they are too large to sell growlers (my guess is their sales are less than $2million which is a very small business).
Love the artisan nature of the Surly offerings, the Surly attitude, the Surly nation...this company is a true beer geek haven. 602 charactersstj1xx, Jan 13, 2009
4.54/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5From tizzod's last growler...quite an honor to consume over an evening. Surly was "selling too much beer" at the brewery according to the Minnesota liquor control board, so its success was rewarded with a ban on free trade...no more growlers at the brewery. How is this American?
Dark amber brew from this aging growler still has fine carbonation, but raises little head. The lacing is intricate and beautiful, however.
Aromas of powerful hop oils dance across the nose; citurs, pine, very fresh, very delicious.
This DIPA does a perfect balancing act betweenteh alcohol, sweet malt and wonderfully aromatic hops, with a lingering and delicious bitterness that never exhausts the palate. I love it, and I am not usually a DIPA lover; hop monster lovers moight find this beer tame, but they will probably admit that this is a wonderful beer. 843 characterskenito799, Jan 13, 2009
4.64/5  rDev +4%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Had this courtesy of gford217 - much obliged.
Pours a cloudy deep copper color without much of a head due to a growler pour. What little head there is sticks around for a while and leaves decent lacing.
Smells great. Huge citrus aromas - mostly grapefruit, but also some orange and a bit of tropical fruit - are backed up by muted floral hop aromas and sweet caramel malt. This is what I like a DIPA to smell like.
Tastes much as the smell would lead one to think, though the malt flavors hold a bit more sway here. Grapefruit and tropical fruits kick things off, then are gently overtaken by caramel malt. There's a slightly bitter ending that gives the sip a solid finality.
Mouthfeel is good. This tastes just as thick as it looks, and goes down smoothly.
Drinkability is great. There's really no reason to sell bottles of this, I could finish off an entire growler by myself.
Overall this is one of the better DIPA's I've had, and thanks again to gford217 for sharing this. 983 charactersglid02, Jan 12, 2009
4.5/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Consumed on 1/11/09
Poured from a 64oz Surly growler with a two finger head that faded very slowly and had a crystal clear copper appearance. A huge citrus hop aroma and slight maltiness reappeared in the taste which hit the tongue like a hop semi - explosive! Felt smooth going down and the hops caught the tongue like little hop needles. Amazingly easy to drink for the amount of hops and high alcohol content. Very impressed with this beer and feel very lucky to have had it. I hope Surly seriously considers brewing it again next year because I've never had a DIPA quite like this - essentially furious on steroids! 620 charactersdeliriumfest, Jan 12, 2009

Pours a slightly hazy orangish amber with a small tan head that showed decent retention and spotty lacing.
Upon opening, the growler threw off one of the most appetizing aromas I have ever smelled. It was just about fruit you could imagine in an IPA just streaming out. Grapefruit was the most prominent aroma but there was oranges, lemons, and other tropical fruits. There was a bit of caramel malt sweetness in the there as well.
The taste follows the aroma and is almost as spectacular. It's still all about the fruity hops - grapefruit especially. The caramel malts balance the taste well and there was a subtle bitterness that took a backseat to the fruits.
The mouthfeel is medium to full bodied for the style with good carbonation and less abrasive than most DIPAs.
I can't thank Brian and Bill enough for the opportunity to try and share this great beer with everyone this weekend. It is quite possibly the most drinkable DIPA I have tasted and one of the better beers I have tried in a while. Excellent. 1,134 charactersgford217, Jan 11, 2009

64oz growler. sampled jan 10/09.
pours a nice deep orange, almost red. there's a touch of haze and a few chunks floating around, hops i'd guess. a nice dense yellow head forms, dropping fairly fast and leaving tons of lace behind.

taste is great. medium-high bitterness level. light alcohol. lightly toasted multi-grain bread. cracker. bit of biscuit. orange peel. grapefruit and pine. orange and tangerine. there are floral and earthy components too. a bit more lightly sweet honey and caramel comes out as it warms a little.
mouthfeel is great. just over medium body. super fine medium-light carbonation. silky smooth.
drinkability is great. excellent balance. really nice depth overall. it didn't kick me in the face quite like i expected, coming across with more finesse than i would have guessed from the name and the brewery. good stuff. time for another glass! 1,100 charactersgrub, Jan 10, 2009

I was thrilled to fianlly see it come fdwon adn very thankful to have been able to take part in this one. Served cold and poured into multiple pints, it was a privedge to be able to share this oen with Bill at Barleys last night. Consumed on 01.08.2009.
The pour was wonderful. Rich copper colored amber coming forward with a light haze to it. A huge billowing head of white foam came up over the top and settled down only lightly as we progressed. Lots of sticky lace moving up and down on the sides of the glass. 
The aroma was loaded down with just tons of stick fresh hop notes. Big aroma here of tangerine and pineapple, very sweet with a light malt base just barely poking its head through to give it some sense of balance. Really very well done here I have to say. As the first sip comes across, the only thing that coems to mind is just how rediculously smooth this one is. Seriously, this is just insane it is soo good. Light enough to be quaffable, there was no sense of big alcohol here at all. Sticky, medium bodied ale was just the right amount of carbonation. Ripe, fresh hop flavors here, sweet candy like sugar dumped on top of the bitter pineapple and grapefruit liek taste, just soothed and mellowed right down to the last drop.
Overall I am very happy that Surly made this, and that I got to try it! One of the bestDIPA I have had, definitely one of the most drinkable. This is one to eek out for sure. 1,506 charactersmikesgroove, Jan 10, 2009

A - hazy golden reddish color with a nice off white head
S - heavenly sweet sticky orange citric tones and tones of caramel and tropical fruits.
T - similar to the nose - beautifully blended sticky citric hops and caramel, tropical fruits and sweet malts in a harmonious blend of flavors.
M - full bodied, cream carbonation, citric and oily hops a flavor cacaphony without being overly bitter or brakish, ending with a nice resinous malty note.
D - after a long (can I bold that?) day of travel and work this quaffed dangerously easy! Smooth, savory, satisfying and smooth. Yes sir, I'd like another.
Classified here as a double IPA. I'd have no problem calling it an american barleywine. Heck, I'd have no problem if they bottled this and I grabbed a stash for me! Well worth trying if you get a chance. 928 charactersbarleywinebrewer, Jan 09, 2009

Growler opens with a "hiss" sound indicating a good seal.
Poured into a tulip, this dark amber beer has reddish highlights, and a nice tan head that holds well, although lacing is not pronounced. 
Aroma is, as expected, fresh hops, although not as pungent as I would have loved. Still, quite impressive, piney, citric, fruity with an underlying maltiness.
Good body, creamy, with an assetive hoppiness that falls short of the expected assault, which in my opinion is not a bad thing. Not as much grapefruits, but lots of citric and grassy notes. Some malty sweetness, and a hint of earthiness I cannot place well round up the well balanced taste for a DIPA.
Alcohol is well hidden, and at least feels under 10%. Another very good Surly offering. 841 charactersbrdc, Jan 08, 2009

4.44/5  rDev -0.4%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4This Review is of 16 Grit, released at the brewery before the end of growler sales and the recipe/name change. The hop schedule of 16 Grit is different than Abrasive but for some reason the two beers were merged:
Finally got around to cracking this growler. Pours a hazy copper orange color with a small off-white head, good lacing, and cap that sticks around for some time. Aroma is all orange and lemon zest with hints of pine in the background. Slightly sweet smelling, but it's all floral, citrusy hops in this one. Flavor is piney at first, then turns into bitter grapefruit and orange, lots of juicy hop bitterness. The body is medium-full, ultra creamy, but gets to be a bit harsh as I down a few of them. This is a downright tasty concoction and probably has one the best DIPA noses I've come across. This will go nicely with the chili I made tonight.
If I were to review Abrasive it would be scored 4/5/5/5/5 920 charactersKeefD, Jan 05, 2009
4.45/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Like hundreds of other good people, I stood in line for an hour to get two growlers of this fine stuff. Then I stood in another shorter line to get the growlers hand filled by Omar and the staff. I then went home and killed a growler off since I was tired of waiting in line.
I can only say that this DIPA was like Furious on steroids. It had double the smell and taste which was clear from the first glass. The alcohol was nearly 10% so needless to say, the differences were not as clear by the time I got to the last glass. It is definitely not a session beer unless a session is half a growler.
It is a shame that it was a special run to celebrate the end of Saturday growler sales due to state law issues. It is so powerful in flavor and taste that you just can not drink it all the time but it would be great to have a couple of cans for those nights when a change is in order. 884 charactersdoctormo, Jan 02, 2009
4.32/5  rDev -3.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Appearance: Dark orange-red, smallish head, good lacing.
Smell: Strong citrus and pine. Some sweetness and a cinnamon-like aroma also.
Taste: Initially it tasted a piney and somewhat sweet. Further tastes shifted to a more bitter orange-like flavor. Not over-the-top bitter.
Drinkability: Hides the 9% well and not as bitter as expected means I'll probably drink the growler quickly.
I got one of the last growlers on Monday morning, another great beer from Surly. Not as bitter as I thought it might be, pretty balanced for a DIPA. Hopefully this shows up again in the future! 581 charactersMdog, Jan 02, 2009
4.5/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Cool, I get to be the 10th review. Thanks to kroggdawg for sharing his growler. Frankly, I've gotten tired of imperial this and double that lately, but this beer rocked. It was complex in flavor, yet drinkable for the average hophead and still something different. It seems like most brewer just throw the C-hops (cascade, chinook, centennial, etc) at their DIPAs and let er' rip. This can make a good DIPA, but I've have enough of those.
Right off the bat this beer reminds me of Orange rum and then once I ponder the flavors, I realize it's similar to Surly's delicious Bitter Brewer. Orange citrus hops are the big flavor and aroma note for me in what is a surprisingly appropriately balanced DIPA. There are more pine and grapefruit in the background with subtle cinnamon spices and a very slight vanilla note. Jesus, this is good. I know I'm not the first or last person to say this, but I wish there was more of this beer. Easily one of my favorite DIPAs, better than Pliny the Elder even. If you can ever find this baby, drink it before someone else does. 1,063 characterstempest, Dec 31, 2008

A: Rusty, orange, lacing that will force you to scrub it off the glass.
S: Undoubtedly citrus fruit with orange being the most prevalent. Hops all up in deez nostrils.
T: A heavyweight in the middleweight class, big taste. Strong candy with afirm orange/pine taste upfront with a pleasant hoppy bitterness that sticks to the palate. This makes me want to think of Furious as the ugly stepchild?
M: Put this one in the lower heavy mouthful bracket because of the hoppy butt of the beer. Body could use a little more lightness to bring out the upfront citrus flavor and make the beer more drinkable.
D: Might be the heaviest IPA you could pass on to your girlfriend. 790 charactersMPLS, Dec 29, 2008
4.65/5  rDev +4.3%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A- Hazy orange liquid that you can not easily see through. Half inch white foamy head that sticks to the glass as you drink it. 
S- Huge citrus aroma, orange peal, grapefruit, and hint of apple. Some pine and spiciness from the hops. Also some brown sugar sweetness. 
T- The first thing I taste is citrus fruit, oranges, grapefruit and lemon zest. It is balances with a very sweet malty base that tries to hold up against the hops but the hops take over at the end leaving you with a citrus, bitter after-taste. 
M- Thick but not mouth coating, crisp, and smooth. Just right. 
D- I could drink a growler of this to myself. Though I may end up pretty drunk. 
Overall I would say this is the best DIPA I have ever had. It has the huge hops but is still very drinkable. 772 charactersbr3wmeister, Dec 29, 2008
4.5/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Named 16 Grit, in honor of his dad's abrasives business, where the brew house is situated. Growler picked up and drank the very same day, fresh as can be. Into a pint glass, pours a dark amber copper color with a nice off-white head, good retention. The aroma is intense, some fantastic fruits popping out, caramel malts hovering in there too. The taste is even better, lives up to its name but drinkability doesn't suffer. The same fruits and caramel sugar are there, sweeter than I'd have thought. The mouth is great, thick, coating, oozing, but not syrupy, not too hot, lovely. Overall, probably the quickest I've ever drank a growler, if that says anything. 661 charactersobjectivemonkey, Dec 29, 2008
4.67/5  rDev +4.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.564 oz. growler, filled on 12/27/08 at the brewery.
Slightly hazy, dark copper with glowing orange edges. Small, but persistent, light beige gauzy head. Big juicy hop nose filled with pineapples, pine resin, mango, tangerine, and herbal funk. Sugary malt, and caramel aromas in the background.
Herbal hop bitterness rings out up front. Pine resin/sap flavors follow, mixing with cookie dough malt. Hints of boozy fruits as well. Pineapple, tangerine, and mango hop bitterness come on strong near the finish. Faint warming notes, before cat pee, aspirin, and grapefruit bitterness take over the finish. Lingering fruit sweetness. Very nice! Medium-bodied with light carbonation. Smooth and very drinkable--especially if you like very fresh hop blast! 750 charactersalexgash, Dec 28, 2008
4.82/5  rDev +8.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Growler poured into Bouleverd smokestack series goblet
Appearance: Hazy orange/caramel color with half inch white head.
Smell: Heavy citrus aromas. First thing that came to mind was marmalade. Spans through every citrus fruit, you name it it's there. There's also some herbal tea aromas in the background. Very floral and potent. Slight caramel sweetness. 
Taste: Just as much citrus flavor as there is aroma. Bitter orange, grapefruit, pineapple, passion fruit, and mango jump out right away. It's a beautiful and floral fruit punch of a DIPA. Nice caramel background with some tea flavors. You know those sugar coated candies that look like grapefruit or orange slices? Imagine one of those with with light, high-quality caramel drizzled over it. Awesome. Bitter but not as biting as Furious, which is kind of nice. This is great.
Mouthfeel: Perfect for a DIPA. Not too syrupy but thick enough to coat the mouth and let the wonderful flavor stick around. Carbonation is spot on too.
Drinkability: I'm gonna finish my first growler tonight and be drunk but will probably want to open my other one, it's that good.
Overall: Amazing. This might be the best DIPA out there. Too bad it's such a limited time. I love Surly and once again they've made a world class brew. 1,272 charactersoptiontwo, Dec 28, 2008
4.79/5  rDev +7.4%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Picked up a couple growlers at the brewery.
16 Grit Ale pours into a pint glass a cloudy orange red with a relatively smallish (1/2-in.) white head. Lace retention was good to very good.
Aroma is heavy on the citrus with a buttery base - ripe orange and mellow grapefruit. Very reminiscent of Bell's HopSlam, but a bit more pungent. This stuff smells what you'd expect a fresh, Surly DIPA to smell like: off-the-charts good. 
Taste is nicely balanced between the sweet base and the bitter, resiny hops. Again, ripe orange was the flavor I picked out easiest. There was a lingering bitterness that was noticable but not distracting. It's not over-the-top bitter like it could have been; that might have looked that they were trying to one-up their flagship, Furious. No, this is an incredibly tasty change of pace. 
Mouthfeel was wonderfully thick and slick. Maybe a little too slippery? Could use just a tiny bit more carbonation imo. 
Drinkability was very high indeed. I can see myself having no problem finishing a growler over the course of an evening. Having a buddy or two over would be even better.
Another home run from Surly. They deserve all the accolades they get. It's sad that this will only be brewed once. I'm glad I had the opportunity to grab it while it was around. 1,289 charactersBlybloke, Dec 28, 2008
4.72/5  rDev +5.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Filled just over an hour ago, ready to enter my awaiting Surly pint glass. I've been waiting a long time for a Surly DIPA, so glad the chose one as a final shebang for growler sales at the brewery!
Pours a hazed and honeyed amber, just shy of a blooming red, small but sufficient creamy head on top. 
Smelling it: gorgeous bitter hop nose, but still a sweetness below, honey mixed with citrus fruit, tangerine and grapefruit, beautifully balanced. This is big, but no brute.
Tasting it: Climbs on board the mouth and takes control, move over, 16 Grit is here...sits down and starts to shine...Again, a blast of bitter that really floods the mouth, thrills the senses and drips down to enter other cavities and creep alongside oft neglected corridors. Fiercely wondrous hoppitude, not brutal, not punishing, just brilliant. 
Medium to full bodied, long, ever-lasting finish, stays a good spell on the tongue, the sides, the roof of the mouth...lingers in the nostils, hangs in the back of the throat...feels strong, but not too...8%...I wouldn't doubt 10, though...hops are so huge in this...an utter delight. 
They must have used a massive amount of malt, as well, because the enormous hop content is well-matched by the juicy, sweet malt.
Great job, this is an excellent ale.
Hope to see something similar in kegs and cans soon!
Hint, hint. Todd... 1,355 charactersfeloniousmonk, Dec 27, 2008
