4.04/5  rDev -8.4%look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Pours pitch black and very shiny. Thin fizzy cola-like tan head dissipates steadily leaving no residual head or lacing. Beer looks more syrupy than thick. 
Smell has strong notes of booze, green acidic coffee, and roasted malts. 
Taste follows the nose with lots of coffee, bourbon, chocolate, roasted malts, and oak. Very hot even with a year on it. Lots of alcohol burn on the back end giving way to a pleasant warming sensation all the way down. For such a high ABV beer, this is exceptionally smooth and well crafted. A tad on the sweet side. 
Feel is sticky and syrupy but not overly thick. 
This is one of those beers that you should try once. For me personally, these super high ABV beers are just too much, but as they go, this one is well done. 757 charactersFBarber, May 07, 2017

Pours a deep chocolate brown, mostly opaque, with a half inch head and some loose lacing.  The smell is malt, bourbon, lots of really good coffee, raisins, dates, light chocolate.  The taste leads with bourbon- but it's not overbearing, still lots of coffee, malt, dates, some chocolate and caramel, light figs.  No bitterness, a light sweet note.  Incredibly smooth for the ABV, it's actually pretty creamy.  A great, full body, well carbonated.
This is one everyone should try, even though it has a high price point.  Well blended, super smooth, great coffee flavor and aroma.  Well worth a purchase. 667 charactersstortore, May 01, 2017

Though its alcohol content is higher, the alcohol is more well hidden by the intense flavors, thick mouth feel, and bitterness from the hops.   I remember the pour was opaque jet black. There was an intoxicating aroma of chocolate and coffee with a smooth and balanced taste, sweet and bitter.   Thick, creamy and a bit oily feel. Sure there was some alcohol burn, but impressively little for over 16%.  I couldn't really drink anything else after this… But being so satisfied, why would I want to? 695 charactersPlinyMeNow, Apr 16, 2017

For whatever reason, there wasn't much of a nose on my bottle, just a bit of muted coffee, roasty malt.  However, this is a great tasting stout - all of the components are at the same time balanced - and bold.  Dark chocolate flavors seamlessly meld with fresh roasted coffee, a bit of brown sugar, burn from the alcohol, finished off with the whisky barrel.  Great stuff.  Would certainly buy again - but will have to split it next time! 550 charactersChcshammonde, Mar 27, 2017

Look: Pours a thick, oily black and settles with a finger thick, light tan head.
Smell: I can smell the bourbon as soon as I started pouring. Coffee, dark chocolate, roast, with a perfume undertone. Notes of caramel, and butterscotch emerged as it warmed.
Feel: Silky smooth, but thick bodied, as expected. Very mild carbonation.
Taste: Bourbon, roasty coffee, and dark chocolate up front, with no trace of boozy alcohol. Sweet caramel and butterscotch come into play on the back end, and pair up with the other flavors, along with a very minor booze aspect.
Overall: Simply amazing. At 16% ABV, I was expecting a boozy bomb, but instead got a perfectly balanced treat. Great presence of bourbon, without the boozy alcohol, balanced by roast coffee, and sweets. 882 charactersBonkinishwa, Mar 24, 2017

Aroma is heavenly, just tons of sappy barrel, maple syrup, vanilla bean, cocoa, coffee, fudge, bourbon. This nose is every bit as good as the $25 bomber barrel stouts. 
Flavor is less smooth than I'd like, it's my main complaint - lots of sharp alcohol, tons of antiseptic burn - but beyond that, it's smooth caramel all the way to the bank, with coffee, bourbon, vanilla, cinnamon, and chocolate. 
Feel is hot and dry, boozy.

L.  Total blackness, impressive head for 17.5% leaving a film and bigger patches in it's wake.
S.  Fruity dark roast coffee, deeply roasted malt, rich dark chocolate fudge, aromatic wood, sweet toffee. Warming up brings more whiskey aromas.
T.  Rich sweet coffee, rich fudge with booze, chocolaty malt, dark fruits with nice whiskey flavors in the middle, hot on the finish with caramel, chocolate, and coffee.
F.  Full mouthfeel, plenty of carbonation, pretty smooth. Warm in the middle, hot by the finish.
O.  This beer is an experience. You expect the heat so it's not disappointing but adds nice flavor and feel components. Worth trying, even if only just once given the price. Cheers!! 737 charactersmuchos, Mar 12, 2017

Aroma starts off with coffee (but not in your face) along with a rich, sweet chocolate, vanilla, bourbon and even sweeter malt notes too.
Taste is a great combo of coffee/chocolate with fudge, vanilla and bourbon/oak in the finish. Bit of sweeter malt notes and some roasty notes too. A lot going on and intense tasting, but not over the top.
Full bodied, creamy mouthfeel, alcohol is SCARY hidden. There is some definite warmth, but not burning or overly boozy. Maybe one of the more balanced of the crazy high ABV Avery beers. 590 charactersJohnnyMc, Mar 06, 2017

Tons of coffee and chocolate in the flavor, a touch of black licorice, cola, and bourbon on the finish. The mouth is full bodied, very chewy. Really tasty beer, so much so that I do not detect any alcohol flavor. Great flavors, and a beer that I would recommend to any coffee stout fan. 558 charactersSiepJones, Mar 04, 2017

Look- It's dark, almost black. When there's light behind it, you can see that it is in fact, dark brown. From the moment its poured you know that this beer is serious.
Smell- Chocolate, Coffee, Bourbon, Boozey. It smells like someone soaked an espresso bean in bourbon in all the right ways.
Taste- Brace yourself, this beer is going to kick you in the teeth and promptly apologize. The flavor is huge on the front and concludes with a nice roasted coffee note that leaves you craving another sip. Please keep in mind, this is a high ABV beer and it is apparent in its taste. It's not liquor but you can tell its more than your ordinary beer,
Feel- Great, full mouth feel without being oppressively heavy. Very little carbonation on this bad boy so you don't get a mouthful of bubble either which is ideal for a stout in my humble opinion.
Overall- Good God, it's good. Do yourself a favor and get yourself a pour of this delicious stout. I promise you won't be disappointed. 1,070 charactersMatthew_Warfield, Feb 26, 2017

Dark and decadent; rich, sweet nose full of chocolate fudge and booze. Flavor is sweet chocolate fudge, roasted coffee, vanilla,  and some harsh ethanol. Medium bodied mouthfeel with good carbonation and some drying oak tannins. Excellent, rich flavor. Very enjoyable beer and would score higher if the booze wasn't so harsh. 350 charactersbrianmandell, Jan 26, 2017
4.1/5  rDev -7%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4Talk about a massive improvement through the use of bourbon barrels and coffee.  Black beer, plenty viscous.   1/3" brown head on top.  Aroma is plenty boozy, but its not just booze, there is plenty of coffee, a small amount of bourbon competing for your nose's attention as well.
Taste, geez its a sipper.  I sat and drank my 12 oz for about 70 minutes.  Just right.  Its strong, its a lot like Mocha Wednesday.  Its deep dark chocolate malt on this one.  Is there actual chocolate added?  Seems like it.  Perhaps thats just how dense the black roasted malt is.  Small bit of vanilla to it.  
I like the 12oz format for such a big beer, but it is plenty pricey.   But it is that giant stout model for sure. 709 charactersrodbeermunch, Jan 25, 2017

Taste is sweet, but astringent and almost artificial. Mouthfeel is tits. So heavy and decadent. The coffee on the nose is a little musty and dated but this is a cellar beer. A true slow sipper. 
While not blown away by this, I'll probably still buy it again. 379 charactersrypkr, Jan 25, 2017

The aroma is roast chocolate malt, sweet vanilla and lots of bourbon with a little coffee and a bit of fusel alcohol. 
The flavor is sweet fudgy chocolate malts with vanilla and a big roast finish with quite a bit of harsh but warming alcohol.  The mouthfeel is medium bodied with smooth carbonation.
Overall, lots of interesting things going on.  Pretty sweet, harsh and boozy.  I remember the original Meph Addict being so much better with less harsh alcohol and a lot more coffee. 632 charactersBeaver13, Jan 22, 2017

Chocolatey, caramel center that's coated with a sturdy layer of bourbon and coffee. Lots of bourbon, but like most Avery barrel aged beers, the booze is so smooth and mellow. This is actually a dangerously crushable brew. Bourbon continues to tingle on the back end and brings hints of vanilla too. Little bit of hazelnut. Decadent and delicious, so much so that I want another, which would be a terrible idea. 498 charactersMongrel, Jan 21, 2017

3.81/5  rDev -13.6%look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 3.75Pours thinner than the ABV would suggest.  Produces an inch and a half light khaki head from the pour with a lingering half inch.  Smell was more coffee forward when it was cold but it quickly dissipated as it warmed.  Light barrel notes up front, with a touch of vanilla and strong sweet char roast notes predominating.  Taste is very sweet, to the point of cloying.  Syrupy with some molasses and licorice; no coffee bite to speak of.  Highly carbonated for the style that does not allow you to get a good feel for the actual beer, makes it feel lighter than it probably is or should be.  Overall I thought the elements of a great BA stout were there but they were really in your face and not at all balanced.  Barrel but sharp, malty but charred, overly sweet with no bitter coffee bite to smooth it out.  Perhaps some time would do it well but as is I was rather unimpressed and is not at all deserving of the rating it has, try cafe ameircano which is not even barrel aged and then come talk to me. 1,003 charactersAmguerra305, Jan 13, 2017

Taste: Bourbon up front, with vanilla midway, finish with charred/tobacco flavor..not much coffee though
Mouth: heavy at first, but light at end
Overall: Bourbon Lovers dream. Kind of underwhelming though. I felt it was over priced(both on draft and in bottle at liquor stores), particularly because there wasn't much coffee presence 472 charactersT-Schroeder, Jan 08, 2017

4.5/5  rDev +2%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Pours a opaque matted black color. There is a head which is rather remarkable for a barrel aged, coffee beer. The aroma is well balanced. There is light roasted coffee, milk chocolate, roasted malt, and a lot of vanilla. The taste is quite bold. Everything it has is in abundance. Chocolate, vanilla, more light roasted coffee, and alcohol. The mouthfeel very full bodied with a chewy, cloying texture. The carbonation is appropriately low. Overall, I'm overly skeptical of beers with the hype that this one possesses, but I have to say this beer live up to it. The only fault I find is that the alcohol is a bit too transparent. My experience with Avery's other extremely high ABV beers tells me that the alcohol will mellow in five or six years time, and bland in wonderfully. But where will the coffee be at that time? 821 charactersKarlHungus, Jan 03, 2017

16%? Not in smell! Aroma is nice coffee, mocha, dark chocolate, with tangy, nutty, roasted malt, sesame, and soy sauce. No booze to burn the nose.
However, taste is deceptive at the very tip up front, but the alcohol quickly reveals itself. I get vanilla, chocolate, nice fruity floral sweet coffee, becoming Baileys, with a sudden, quick, heavy hit of hot, stinging booze as it goes down the throat, all in the span of 5 seconds. A Kahlua-like element is very apparent, and at times it's almost like straight rum.
Body is relatively thin and slick, but frothy and a little sticky with a semi-dry finish. Booze is not hidden in this one, though! 801 charactersSabtos, Dec 24, 2016

2016 batch 3
Dark thin pour. Black beer with light brown tight head, legs develop as it warms but nothing special about the consistency. 
Huge cocoa, chocolate, malt, oatmeal and BOURBON smell. 
Rich bourbon, chocolate and tons of black coffee and hazelnuts with a beyond boozy finish that is easy to manage and fantastic. Thick mouth feel but somewhat lacking in such a big stout. 396 charactersKettleBellFreak, Dec 21, 2016

Pours thicker and darker than year old used motor oil, fizzy super dark head about 1/3 finger, legs that just congeal into single thick layer slowly falling down the sides of the glass, practically stains the glass.
Nose starts with fresh coffee, still there somehow, very nutty, earthy coffee with some roast, mild fudgey cocoa and dark chocolate, into a little bourbon and vanilla toasted oak barrel, touch of booze warmth, peanut butter and nougat, a little roasted malt and touch of char.
Taste brings a little roasted malt, big coffee, coffee syrup and charred roasted coffee, roasted malts, into booze, plenty of hot tingly booze, little phenol too and fusel alcohol, little fudgey cocoa and nougat chocolate ganache, mild bourbon juice, a little vanilla barrel and toasted oak, quite nutty too, and a little vanilla and baking spice.
Mouth is fuller bod, thick fudgey with lots of hot alcohol, decent carb 958 charactersjlindros, Dec 19, 2016

S: A nice aroma of bourbon, coffee, chocolate, and malt.
T: Tasted a fair amount of chocolate, a good shot of bourbon (not as much as I thought), a lot of coffee, some dark malt, as well as a little dark fruit (plums, in particular). A big, powerful taste that you would expect from the this beer. Lots of power and complexity. An interesting taste.
F: A good amount of carbonation with a smooth finish. Medium-bodied.
O: This is definitely one of the more aggressive and likable stouts out there. Quite drinkable. 716 charactersavalon07, Dec 17, 2016

Dark pour, hints of carbonation with a slight mocha head.  Fudge, dark cocoa, bittersweet chocolate, espresso, and bourbon in the aroma.  Sweet dark fruits, bourbon, chocolate, and cold brew coffee make up the flavor.  Medium / full feel with the heat from the 16% abv noticeable.  Overall, another amazing barrel aged stout from Avery; and this may be my favorite! 401 charactersdpgoblejr, Dec 17, 2016

L: Pours black with brown 1" thick head, which slowly dissipates over a couple of minutes.
S: Strong (!) bourbon, sweet raisins, roasted coffee malt.
T:  Sweetness up front, some of the strongest bourbon-flavor-in-a-beer-I've-ever-tasted in the middle, and roasted coffee to finish it off.  Wow - gigantic bourbon-coffee beer!  My three favorite things!  The alcohol doesn't burn like I expect it should at 16% - I'll have to tread lightly...
F:  Medium body. Light carbonation.  Kinda chewy.  Slides easily over the mucosa and down the hatch.
O:  This is a super sexy...thing.  Highly recommend.  Probably share with a couple of intrepid friends. 762 charactersSchimms, Dec 16, 2016

3.5/5  rDev -20.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 2.75 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5Opticals are as expected. Aroma is very coffee forward - lots of husky south American vibes going on - with a little bit of vanilla and oak. I lost more of the coffee than I'd like on the tongue, with more of the bourbon flavors jostling for supremacy. It is fairly "hot", especially as it opens up, and that pushes the coffee flavor aside even more without pulling through the more elegant bourbon notes. You get just a kiss of vanilla amd some chocolate malt, but the boozeyness reigns supreme. it isn't so overwhelming that it makes the beer undrinkable or anything, just washes out a lot of the other flavors, which is dissapointing. 637 charactersajm5108, Dec 10, 2016
4.15/5  rDev -5.9%look: 4.25 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.25Bottled Nov 14 2016. Nice and fresh so I should get the most coffee flavor. Dark and thick fluid with a finger of head that slowly settled to a thin cap. Spotty lacing is left down the glass. Aroma of alcohol and bourbon and that is about all. But the flavor is where it counts and this does not disappoint. Bourbon and vanilla upfront before opening up to reveal flavors of chocolate, coffee, before eventually leaving a alcohol flavor and burn to cleanse the palate. Thick body with lovely carbonation that gives a full, smooth texture. I sort of expected more coffee and I imagine with age that flavor would all but disappear but the alcohol would probably mellow out. So it would be a tradeoff. 698 charactersmorimech, Dec 10, 2016

The beer itself is black as oil. Nose is syrupy bourbon, dark chocolate, expresso, molasses, candies sugar, vanilla, lactose, and light baking spice. Surprisingly little booziness to the aroma. The taste is very sweet, like liquid chocolate and home-made candy. Modest, balanced bourbon - present but not overpowering. Notes of coffee, vanilla, molasses, oak, ginger, and honey throughout, especially on the aftertaste. The feel is full and dense, but not really chewy. The alcohol thins this out a bit, but not too much. This is definitely a sipper, but it's easy enough to drink that it could get you in trouble pretty quick! 740 charactersdo_ob, Dec 08, 2016

Poured into a tulip.
Aroma: wonderful! Chocolate, flourless chocolate cake, vanilla, oak and bourbon. Very inviting.
Appearance: luxurious. Velvet obsidian. Thick. The head is a dark tan (espresso crema).
Flavor: this is a big beer - a detonation of bold flavors on your palate. Coffee is the initial flavor, and the alcohol is certainly present - duh @ 17.81 % abv, but it is in no way hot. This is such a big beer 25 cl is all that I want. This beer is so strong that it almost needs to be categorized as a double imperial stout / triple stout. 
Mouthfeel: right in line with what is need to carry this beer's alcohol content and big flavors. 
Overall: good > very good, but I think Avery's Vanilla Bean Stout is better. This beer is too strong to enjoy. As I sip on this beer,  "booze bomb" comes to mind. I drank this beer the day after an Odell's Woodcut #7 (Imp. Stout). The Odell's was better. 928 charactersPray_For_Mojo, Dec 03, 2016
4.49/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.512oz bottle from local bottle shop for $14. Dated Nov 14 2016.
Black, opaque elixir poured into snifter. One finger light brown head to thick collar with copious lacing as the tasting proceeds.
Coffee predominates with roasted malt, char, molasses, barrel and a nice bourbon aroma layering over the top.
Coffee forward, dark chocolate, charred malt and bourbon.  
Full bodied, chewy and a bit slick on the finish. A bit of alcohol burn mellows as the liquid hits the back palate.
A well made BA imperial stout. A pleasure to finally be able to buy "on the shelf" in OH. 574 charactersCaptCleveland, Dec 03, 2016

A- Pours pitch black with a small amount of khaki head which hangs around awhile. Plenty of sticky lacing is apparent with this one. 
S- Smell is tons of coffee, some chocolate, and dark malts. I surprisingly don't get much bourbon. 
T- The initial sip brings huge coffee notes along with some sweet chocolate. The bourbon barrel kicks in after but isn't as prevalent as I expetced. 
M- Thick, chewy, coffee-forward, slight warming with each sip but drinks easier than you'd think at 16% ABV.

Bottle (01/26/16) to snifter.
LOOK:  dark black, medium tan head, fades to lacing,  thick viscous looking.
AROMA:  bourbon, dark chocolate, toasted malt, coffee is there but faint.  Maybe I waited too long to try this to get the full coffee.
TASTE:  malty bitter stout and hot bourbon, dark chocolate lingers, a touch of some dark fruit....blackberry, blueberry, plum, dates.
FEEL:  carbonation is excellent for such a thick beer.  Small bubbles.  Keeps roiling in your mouth while tasting. 
Excellent Beer.  Next time I need to drink sooner to see if the coffee shows up; not that that is really required, but with a name like Tweak.....well, good job Avery.

Flavors are heavily roasted and robust coffee forward, charred and rich, like a mouthful of coffee grounds. Immediate follow of bourbon heat and spice, vanilla, charred wood, milk chocolate, and earthy highlights. Rich, smooth, full bodied, with a heavily roasted coffee and vanilla bourbon blend aftertaste. Smooth, creamy, slow finish. Big beer, and damn tasty. 573 charactersGarthDanielson, Oct 18, 2016

Look- A rather thin looking but oily dark cola color with a thin layer of tan foam. 
Smell- Bourbon forward with char, vanilla and oak. 
Taste- Bourbon flavor once again dominates followed by coffee, char, vanilla and a solid dose of oak. 
Feel- Oily but rather thin for such a big stout. A very noticeable alcohol burn in the beginning that subsides over time. 
Overall- Damn, this is one great beer that I wish I had access to! A thinner version of the old school Bourbon County Coffee. It's loaded with wonderful bourbon and coffee flavor. Check it out if you haven't yet. 641 charactersPrager62, Sep 24, 2016

Has a very sweet taste with chocolate, cocoa, Bourbon, coffee, coconut, dark roasted malt, vanilla, and oak. The alcohol is noticeable, but not in a negative way.  I am glad Avery bottles their big beers in 12 ounce bottles, instead of 22 ounce bottles or 750 ml bottles which are pretty ridiculous.
full bodied with moderate carbonation. A real treat of a beer to drink. 568 charactershardy008, Sep 20, 2016

A: Sludgey black pour. One finger of brown head retains well. Wispy lacing.
S: Strong earthy and nutty coffee nose. Deep tootsie roll/fudgey impression. Thick chewy caramel. These top notes blanket estery scents of grape skins and Pinot noir. The thick malt presence almost dominates the barrel contributions too, but whiffs of barrel char, faint wood, and bourbon ball candy pull through slightly.
T: Earthy and nutty coffee blends seamlessly with rich malty decadence. Melted milk chocolate, chewy dark caramel, bourbon ball candy. Brown sugar. Vinous estery notes emerge slowly and build as the beer warms. Wood and bourbon character are far more assertive than the nose suggested, bringing a very wet and corny sweet bourbon character that dominates the finish. 
M: Huge, thick body is rich and decadent. Melt-in-your-mouth chocolate truffle sort of feel. So velvety smooth. Carbonation prickles at the tip of the tongue.
O: The base beer is apparently Mephistopheles, but it's almost unrecognizable underneath the coffee and barrel treatment. They take this beer in a completely different direction. Rich, decadent, silky smooth. Flavors meld together perfectly for the ultimate luxurious sipping experience. The barrel takes a pretty firm hold by the end, but there's more than enough malt body to keep it real. 1,357 charactersryan1788a5, Aug 31, 2016

Pours absolutely pitch black with bubbles that devolve into a film. Smell is of heavy roast, coffee, oak and bourbon, along with dark chocolate. Taste reflects the smell. Initial drink tastes of heavier bourbon and oak, with roasted malt and intense coffee, finishes with a pleasant dark chocolate aftertaste and a lingering roasty flavor, very nice. The feel is this stout is thick and viscous, but not flat. Overall this is a very good beer with great bourbon and coffee characteristics. 532 charactersReema, Aug 01, 2016

Appearance - Pours black with cola brown edging where light can penetrate. Cocoa powder colored, half finger head that dissipates quickly, leaving behind a mostly barren surface with a razor thin, broken ring around the edge of the glass. No lacing, but leaves a light film on the glass for a few seconds.
Smell - Fudgy chocolate and roasted coffee with lighter vanilla and fair boozy, bourbon undertone. Hints of oak and caramel. 
Taste - Follows the nose, but with stronger bourbon influence. Big notes of fudge and roasty coffee hit first before the sweet bourbon character hits. Vanilla and molasses. Light oak. Caramel undertone. 
Mouthfeel - Full-bodied with moderate, lightly tingly carbonation. A bit sticky on the lips with a booze influenced, bone dry finish.
Overall - Incredibly tasty. Up there with the best BA fudge/coffee bombs I've had, Big Bad Baptist comes to mind, though not quite as smooth. Why drop the same price on a beer that's 10oz less? I'd buy another bottle to age, but beyond that I'm not so sure. 1,068 charactersTheSixthRing, Jul 21, 2016

A- Black with a two finger mocha head
S- Very boozy, but underneath that is a great rich chocolate and coffee, hints of vanilla, bourbon.  The more I smells this he less harsh the booziness is, but it is still harsh.
T- Coffee, rich chocolate, bourbon, some vanilla, boozy as hell, missing a lot of balance...
M- Harsh, full body.
O- This beer is a big boozy mess, but there is a good beer here.  I really feel this needs to be aged, probably at least two years.  As I drink it gets better, but this is not as good as the other high ABV I've had from Avery. 605 characterslarryi86, Jul 19, 2016

The color is perfectly black and the head is tan, lacy, and light. To my nose the smell is pure bourbon. The taste is overwhelmingly sweet, with lots of malt, again the intense bourbon, and not much bitterness. Glad I tried it, but probably a novelty beer in my book. 307 charactersjohnnyd10vt, Jun 24, 2016

Tastes is dominated by bourbon and chocolate. The coffee flavor is as much of a charred malt as it is beans/grounds. Fair amount of sweetness. Tons of alcohol. I know it is almost 18%, but it is too hot for a beer. I consider World Wide Stout, which is higher, and many Bruery beers in this range, and they are better integrated. 
Sort of surprisingly, the body is very viscous and velvety. Probably the best aspect overall. 
Great beer, but I am glad I split it. Thanks @somethingclever but I think Uncle Jacobs is better 595 charactersWesMantooth, Jun 15, 2016

Aromas were extremely heavy with dark sweetened chocolate and alcohol. It actually smelled thick. Notes of coffee as well but the aromas of chocolate just took over. Flavors were hot. Tons of rich, thick, viscous chocolate and some coffee. The heat from the booze was obvious but tolerable. The mouthfeel was thick but the heat was what stood out. Could feel the slight burn from swallowing the beer. I don't see the point of a beer being that high in ABV. Its good but a bit of an overkill. Glad I had a friend to share this with. 600 charactersBenish, Jun 13, 2016

Served in a snifter, the beer pours dark brown/black with about an inch tan head.  Head retention and lacing are both really good.  Aroma is nice, the brew smells like coffee, bourbon, chocolate, vanilla and roasted malt.  For the most part I think the taste is just like the aroma, but there's also some molasses and burnt/charred malt noticeable too.  Mouthfeel/body is full, it's slick and smooth with moderate carbonation.  At 17.5% ABV, it's not as boozy as I was expecting.  It's pretty easy drinking for something that strong, too.  I think this is really good, but then I'm not surprised that I like this a lot because I'm also an Avery Mephistopheles fan.  I definitely recommend Tweak, I know I'd love to buy this! 791 charactersbluejacket74, Jun 12, 2016

12oz bottle into a snifter
Batch No. 2, bottled on: Jan 25, 2016
A: Pours a somewhat thin appearing jet black with browning on the edges. 1 fingers width of mocha head builds and then dissipates down fairly quickly, leaving a moderate amount of lacing.  4.25
S: Aroma is big coffee, super roasty, lots of booze, and barrel notes.  Its actually fairly reminiscent of Bourbon County with its roasty and barrel characters.  Quite sweet too, some cocoa.  Great nose.  4.5
T:  Chocolate, coffee, lots of booze.  Big mocha flavor lingers on the finish.  Some sugary sweetness.  A touch boozier than I would like, but I guess thats expect at 17.5%.  4.5
M/D: Fuller bodied, but a touch thin for such a huge beer.  Carbonation moderate but appropriate.  ABV is definitely noticeable, although theres not a burn going down.  All things considered drinkability is actually pretty good.  4.25
O:  Pretty killer beer.  A touch boozey at time which detracts from the other flavors, and mouthfeel could be thicker to carry the big characters, but overall pretty excellent.  4.25 1,082 characterszac16125, Jun 04, 2016
4.13/5  rDev -6.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4.25Jet black with a tan head that disappears quickly. Nose is all coffee and bourbon, and the alcohol heat is notable even in the aroma. Taste is no surprise after the nose. Bourbon, coffee, chocolate, vanilla and a LOT of alcohol burn. Finish is mainly coffee. t's a nice flavour- the coffee and bourbon are quite balanced, which is good - but the booze prevents it from being particularly drinkable. Like other beers of this strength, it is hard to understand why it needs to be quite so absurdly strong. Wouldn't a nice sedate 12% do the trick?! That said, other than the heat, the beer feels great- thick and velvety. Would be great if dialed down. 649 charactersjrenihan, Jun 04, 2016

3.97/5  rDev -10%look: 4.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 42014 October vintage, enjoyed May 2016.
Black Appearance, tan lingering head, looks pretty thick. 
Smell is roast, bourbon, coffee, and an earthy funk (maybe from the interplay of coffee and barrel).
Taste is surprisingly bitter. Very roasty, bitter coffee, hit alcohol -- pretty rough. Not a sweet drinkable stout. A bit of caramel sweetness takes the edge off the bitterness but it's still a bit much for me.
Overall probably won't revisit this one. Maybe with even more age it'll mellow out a bit more but a pretty intense drinking experience. 550 charactersPDXAmbassador, May 31, 2016

A- Opens well and pours next to no head and it was gone in seconds. Very dark brown colour.
S- Tons of heat. Coco, coffee and yup you guessed it, heat
T- Heat. Lots and lots of heat. The chocolate and coffee is there but the heat is not masked in any way shape or form. The heat overpowers whatever bourbon barrel aging that was there. Just a hot mess
M- Yup you guessed it again! Heat.
O- Not so good. Way too hot and light on flavor. Heat and alcohol bomb.
Food Pairing
This boozy mess was so hot that it was difficult to pair but it did go well with...... Vanilla ice cream. Creamy, high end like Ben and Jerry's then this one the side. Helps kill the heat down a touch and brings the bourbon up a bit which is nice since there is not much there.

4.42/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Bottled Jan. 25, 2016, Batch No. 2: Pours pitch black color with a fizzing sound crackling as the foamy 2 finger tan head faded on the average speed time, bordering on too fast for my liking but with such a high alcohol level this is what I expected. The head was packed with tiny bubbles and left decent spotty lacing that slid down the glass yet left some smaller rings as it went down..
Smells really rich with robust coffee, bourbon, molasses and all kinds of roasted and chocolate malts dominating the initial whiff. Cold brewed coffee, caramel, espresso, brown sugar, Hershey's dark chocolate bar, cocoa powder, vanilla, burnt grains or charred wood and the oaky bourbon barrel notes round out the nose. The alcohol is very aggressive since this is a young bottle, but the foundation is really nice and complex to inhale. Super malty with that fresh coffee bean smell mixed with a shout of bourbon - just what I hoped for when I cracked the cap off. 
Tastes like it smells, but before my brain could process all the complex notes, my esophagus and stomach felt the initial burn which then paved the way for the robust coffee and bourbon flavors. The flavor profile almost seems endless: rich roasted coffee, chocolate, vanilla, chicory, bourbon, molasses, smoked grains, roasted malts, chocolate malts, peat moss, cold brewed coffee, caramel, espresso, brown sugar, Hershey's dark chocolate bar, cocoa powder, charred wood, oaky/woody bourbon barrel notes and black licorice seem to be enough to list. There might even been some herbal notes, dark fruits and soy sauce coming through, but I gave up trying to pinpoint what I was tasting 5 minutes  ago so I could finish the glass and maximize my enjoyment. It's really damn good and dynamic, somehow Avery added finesse to this big, bold barrel aged behemoth brew.
Mouthfeel is hot - aggressive - like a shot of bourbon basically. Then, like a good buffalo wing the pain subsides and you appreciate the flavor and notice that the feel is creamy and smooth after the booze fades. The body is thick and chewy, with a dense malty feel that has a slight coffee bitterness like a Starbucks bold with no cream or sugar. The carbonation is timid, and the aftertaste is a mix of dark chocolate and a quality bourbon. This beer makes no attempt to hide the 17.5% ABV listed on the bottle, so basically buyer/drinker beware.
I know this is a young imperial stout based on the bottling date, but I couldn't wait to try it and i'm damn glad I did. Overall a great beer that will get better with age. It's too hot right now and the alcohol burn takes a bit away from the flavor, mouthfeel as well as the aromatics. A bottle of this with 1-2 years of aging will be sublime. I'll wait until having a well aged bottle before raising the scores up, but if my hunch is correct then this will be outstanding in a year. Pricey for a 12 oz bottle, but well worth it. 2,905 charactersCHickman, May 14, 2016

A: deep brown to black hue. Brown to caramel large bubble thin head. Almost some hints of red in the head. 
S: booze. But in a sweet not brash way. Some coffee also. Dark fruits. Candied dates. Cocoa. 
T: sweet booze. Coffee right after. More dark dried fruits. Bitter dark chocolate. 
F: amazing. So mellow. No Raw alcohol. Soft thick syrup. Costs the palate with flavor busts of coffee stay to linger. Beautiful. 
O:  This is delightful. Worthy of the great rating. Sweet but not cloying. Bitter but not overly for the style. Bourbon runs through but doesn't engulf the base stout. And the coffee feels so organically placed. Like it was invited by a close friend. Really one of the best. 715 charactersHop_God, May 13, 2016

4.45/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Pours black with a medium sized khaki head. Head retention is moderate, with a little bit of lacing left behind. Big bourbon, oak, and coffee notes. Subtle notes of roasted malts behind. It smells powerful. Bourbon and coffee make up most of the flavor. Oak and roasted malts add to the complexity. Huge taste. Alcohol can be tasted at the end of the taste. Mouth feel is thick, bold, and creamy. Overall, this is a sublime beer. Extremely coffee forward, which is excellent. As the beer warms, bourbon starts to play a larger role in the flavor profile. Just be warned it's a huge beer, which makes for easy sipping. Almost more of a session bourbon. Definitely one that needs to be tried, and potentially shared. 
Served in a 12oz snifter. 742 charactersHarrison8, May 06, 2016

4.69/5  rDev +6.3%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Deep jet black.  Descent head for the strength.  Rich caramel color head forms a ring around the glass and a spot of lacing here and there.
Dense, fresh, potent and intoxicating coffee bean, espresso aroma.  Smooth and roasty toasted maple and molasses with a subtle rich bourbon character.  One of the best smelling beers that's ever entered my olfactory receptors.
Flavor is rich, smooth, roasted and sweet.  Lots of dark fruits and toasted sugars.  Dense malt body.  Make way for the fresh, potent coffee that wakes you up and turns you into a rock star in the morning.  Earthy hop qualities are assertive and just succeed to balance the sweet malt character.  Smooth bourbon tones in the finish round out the experience.  I sense a hint of booze but it is very well disguised.
Rich, full, heavy, sticky, dare I say syrupy body fills the mouth and coates the tongue in a thick sugary substance.  Dryness hits in the middle with the coffee load.  Very well carbonated for a beer of this strength.
Overall, an awesome imperial, barrel aged coffee stout which stands up against the best in the world.  Such a tough task to pull off and balance considering the strength.  I love this beer and would love to try ageing a few. 1,227 charactersbnes09, May 04, 2016

4.95/5  rDev +12.2%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Poured 12oz bottle into chalice. Vintage 2016. It is obsidian black with a 2 finger tan head. Gorgeous lacing coats the glass and there is a thin collar. This aroma is divine with coffee, dark chocolate covered espresso beans, and caramel. Big on the bourbon, vanilla, with hints of marshmallow and molasses. Flavor is dominant espresso, cappuccino, and coffee with a huge dark chocolate taste. Bourbon, vanilla, caramel, molasses, and some roasted marshmallow. It's a slow sipper since there isn't a way to hide that 17% ABV. Smooth, rich, velvety and decadent. Carbonation is superb and really adds to the feel. This is awesome and reminds me of 2013 BCBCS. Looks like I'll be buying a bottle each time it is out even at $10. 727 charactersRi0, Apr 24, 2016

S:  Smells of coffee with hints of vanilla and caramel from bourbon barrels hiding in there as well.  Really nice nose
T:  Taste is coffee, roasted malt, bitter dark chocolate, hints of oak with whispers of caramel and vanilla.  Swallow is more roasted malt, chocolate covered espresso beans and lingering oak.
M:  Lighter than expected on the palate with adequate carbonation and a drying finish.
O:  This is a really nice beer.  Huge flavors and alcohol make this one a real sipper.  The complexity is very nice and the fresh coffee notes are awesome.  Definitely one to sip and savor and probably one you should share.  If you see this and big coffee stouts are your thing you need to pick this up. 852 charactersSHODriver, Apr 23, 2016

4.33/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25This beer pours a brownish black with a fairly small and quick disappearing head. The first thing that strikes me about the aroma, and not surprisingly, is how boozy this is. After you get past the powerful alcohol fume, there is a strong note of molasses, caramel, chocolate, and a fairly small amount of coffee. The flavor begins with the strong burnt sugar, molasses, and even rum notes, all very powerful and very dark. Mid palate a bitter coffee ground flavor comes through to dominate the flavor, while the ending holds caramel, bourbon, and vanilla. The mouthfeel is sticky and sweet but not that full. Overall this is a really cool beer, but the booziness makes it a slow, slow sipper (this is probably for the best) I normally don't notice boozy flavors even in very high alcohol beer, but here is is unignorable. Still the complexity and depth are impressive. 869 charactersCzequershuus, Apr 16, 2016

4.64/5  rDev +5.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5It pours nice and dark. Pretty bug, mocha head that lasts l longer than I would expect for a barrel aged beer, especially one with this elevated of an alcohol content. It is a bit thin. I like pouring a BBA Stout and watching sticky ooze flow forth from the bottle and collect like an oil spill into the glass. Boom. Bam. The nose hits you hard. What an aroma? Complex? Yes. Enticing? You betcha. I'm talking layer upon layer of coffee, booze, wood, but it gets better because there is a strong malt presence as well. Figs, caramel, molasses, chocolate. Then you taste it. It's good. It's great. Normally, thus is a particularly sweet style, however, the coffee adds a welcome bitterness. It is perfectly balanced. Also, there is no taste of alcohol. Zero burn. That's scary. This little mother could get you in trouble. The mout feel is a bit thin. I like my beer chewy. Still, this is one of the best beers I've had. Thanks Avery for hitting home run after home run. 968 charactersBenwayPHD, Apr 14, 2016

A:  Very little head, no lacing, but it does have a nice almost black color.
S:  Immediately upon opening I am hit with a strong aroma of coffee and alcohol.  After a minute or so I am left with just the coffee aroma with undertones of vanilla and a slight chocolatey hint.
T:  This is almost exactly what I want to taste from a coffee stout.  I'm getting all of the notes I should from a stout with a coffee presence at its side; this is a perfect balance.  The only knock here is there is a slight boozy note to this, but far less than I would expect considering the ABV.
F:  Pretty low carb.  Not very thick, but its not too thin either.
O:  This is a dangerous beer.  There is a hint of booziness to remind me that I'm drinking a heavy beer, but the coffee helps to hide it.  I'm pretty sure that if it went down any smoother I would be dead.  Overall, this might be my favorite coffee centered beer so far, but unfortunately with it's premium price I would still usually purchase KBS over it when available. 1,054 charactersPierre_Pressure, Apr 12, 2016

Look: Looks pretty typical of a coffee stout.  Small tan head.
Smell: The smell is of absolute chocolate, bourbon, then coffee from strongest to faintest. Also hints of dark fruit.
Taste: This thing tastes great.  Nice hints of chocolate and coffee combo.  Bourbon finishes with a slight burn. Well balanced barrel, not overpowering.
Feel: Mouthfeel is on the thin side, which isn't always a bad thing especially in this situation.  Not Uncles Jacobs Stout thickness by any means. Quite the opposite
Overall: This is a great beer from a great brewery with a great barrel program.  This thing is a beast and a sipper.  Nice as it warms. 703 charactersRodosman, Apr 12, 2016

A: Pitch-black pour with a tall frothy light brown head. Decent head retention. No real signs of lacing, however.
S: Big big coffee aroma. Some light chocolate and vanilla from the bourbon barrels. But mostly coffee. 
T: Ohhh yeah. Up front is a crazy perfect concoction of coffee, hershey's syrup and bourbon. That's exactly what it tastes like. Sweet vanilla in the middle makes it even more sugary. Fudgey brownies make their appearance here too. Some alcohol harshness but nothing like you'd expect (and about 10% of that in the Old Perseverance bottle I had the other day). Great lingering espresso aftertaste.
M: Super heavy and syrupy. 
O: This beer is awesome. A sipper for sure but the alcohol harshness is way lower than you are thinking. With the huge coffee notes, bourbon sweetness and a great chocolate/vanilla backing it's all you'll really taste. I was blown away with how good this was. 947 charactersDope, Apr 11, 2016

~3 months since bottling
Appearance- Pours a black color, opaque body, some brownish hues when swirled. Fine layer of medium tan colored head,, frothy and bubbly. Tons of sticky alcohol legs, coat glass.
Aroma- Coffee grounds, sweet and earthy, espresso bean. Rich dark chocolates, fudgy brownie batter. Sweet bourbon notes, dry and spicy oak barrel, creamy vanilla and caramel.
Taste- Rich and spicy coffee. Sweet bourbon w/ fudgy dark chocolates, moderate roastiness, charred oak barrel. Lots of vanilla, oak, milk chocolates, caramel, almond nuttiness, and coconut.
Feel- Medium feel, not overly thick, slight stickiness and creaminess. Lower carbonation.
Overall- Incredibly rich and flavorful. Masks the high abv insanely well, can feel some warmth going down, but no off-putting fusel alcohol notes. Coffee has a certain sweetness which is very good, and just enough barrel aging to really add complexity to the flavors but not overpower. Awesome beer. 976 charactersOrangeMen, Apr 10, 2016

Appearance: fantastic bottle presentation. Poured very dark with a small brown head that disappeared very quickly and left no trace of head at all. It didn't seem very viscous at all.
Nose: boozy. bourbon, intense espresso coffee, sweet malty backbone, vanilla, tons of barrel character, coconut, toasted oak, char
Taste: follows the nose but with more bourbon kick. The coffee is well integrated into the brew. The how fusel alcohols are very present and quite warming but it isn't too much for this monster.
Overall: I'm happy I got to tried this beer and that I have a few more to sample. I'd like to see some of those fusels mellow out and change the beer. I believe this beer is pasteurized at the brewery (All of Avery sour and barrel beers are per their barrel master) so I'll have to rely on oxidation to take it from here. 904 charactersClavisAurea, Apr 09, 2016

Pours semi-opaque reddish brown with a large sized khaki head which recedes to a smaller ring; some lacing.  Smells of coffee, roasted malt, bittersweet cocoa, earthy hops, and licorice.  The taste follows with roasted malt, bittersweet cocoa, licorice, coffee, and alcohol.  Mild bitterness with a fairly boozy finish; better as it warms to cellar temp.  Thinner body and average carbonation.  Overall, it's boozier and not quite as interesting as Avery's other BA beers, but it's still a well-done IS.  One that I'll be revisiting on another batch. 601 charactersalarmclock314, Apr 06, 2016

  One of the great intense but not bitter coffee stouts out there. Tons of coffee flavor, no harshness the bourbon oak and vanilla sweeten it a bit. Real thick and creamy feel. Not too much of a burn at all. I'm aging a bottle now so I'll try to compare but even fresh from the tap it was ready to drink. 17.1% is fairly well hidden. Another home run for Avery! 415 charactersSHerninko, Mar 29, 2016

4.96/5  rDev +12.5%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5In the glass, the beer looks almost pitch black, save for a faint dark brown at the very bottom.  The head was creamy and light brown when initially poured.  It died fast, as was expected, but a thin half finger or so stuck around far long than expected, and leaves sheets of creamy brown lacing down the sides of the glass.
The aroma is sweet, complex, and bourbon-forward.  Explosions of butterscotch, vanilla, brown sugar, milk chocolate, toasted coconut, coffee cake, caramel, oak, and bourbon tear into the nostrils and immediately invite you in.
This beer tastes like candy upfront.  Butterscotch, caramel, milk chocolate and toffee spread their sticky-sweet goodness over the palate.  Next, the sweetness is balanced out by a bitter cocoa note, oak tannins, espresso roastiness, mocha, and burnt toast.  On the finish, the bourbon takes the palate by force--although it still remains surprisingly smooth--smacking you upside the head with burnt sugar, toasted coconut, and vanilla extract notes.  The retro-exhale burns the nostrils with a hot chili-like fervency.  The aftertaste is fairly clean with a light caramel, butterscotch, and milk chocolate lingering sweetness.
The mouthfeel is oily, smooth, and creamy.  Not quite as slippery smooth as BCBS, but close.
This is absurdly good.  It's just about as good as BCBS.  This is a world-class BBA stout. 1,364 charactersHorseheadsHopHead, Mar 27, 2016

4.54/5  rDev +2.9%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5There's currently a huge glut of bourbon barrel aged stouts, coffee stouts, and of course the hybridization of both.  A lot of them are great.  BCBCS, KBS, Big Bad Baptist, Sunday Morning Stout, et al, are all fine examples of the style, and if you like any of them, you'll likely enjoy the others.  But how do they stand out?  BCBCS is one of the thickest, densest beers you can imagine; SMS has a sweet, fudgey character that is almost addictive; KBS has a strange, chalky texture that I literally dream about.
And Tweak is remarkably, crazily smooth.  Seriously, I don't know what kind of witchcraft Avery uses to make the smoothest extreme beers around, but this is 17% alcohol that you would never know existed.  Nose and taste hit all the classic notes of the style, leaning slightly towards a less bitter coffee flavor than others, while the barrel qualities are more pronounced.  But while Bourbon County or others knock you to your feet with about 5% less booze in them, this is as smooth, easily drinkable a rendition of the style as you could want...so be careful not to drink too fast! 1,098 charactersjmasher85, Mar 24, 2016

The chocolate is like syrup, the bourbon casting vanilla vapors all over it; coffee radiates throughout, amply sweetened as if by boozy molasses. The body is medium-full, a little bit of stick on the finish, and nary a hint of char or rough flavor. the alcohol does sing through, adding a tingle not of carbonation but of heat, and for my tastes, exactly what I expect. A little on the sweet side, but representing all the advertised elements in a big drinking stout. Worthy of the ratings... 569 charactersGreywulfken, Mar 13, 2016

A: Deep black in color with a dark tan head.  I'm actually surprised by the amount of head on it. 
S: Thick rich coffee aroma with vanilla bourbon and oak. In the finish there is a hint of molasses, and a touch of booze.  But for how much alcohol is in this it really doesn't have much of a booze aroma. 
T: Holy hell. Huge rich coffee, and amazing bourbon barrel flavor.  There is an almost earthy like bitterness in the finish, but that seems to diminish a bit as it warms up. And it develops a bit more of a chocolate thing. 
M: Thick body with a syrupy feel, but the fairly heavy carbonation lightens it up a bit. 
O: Overall this beer is pretty damn amazing. Huge, bold, and delicious. 725 charactersBeejay, Mar 13, 2016

Not bitter roast, vanilla, a touch of dark fruit. You get a bit more as it warms, but it's more of the aforementioned flavors that pop. It's like a deconstructed coffee stout. Tons of booze as goes without saying, but a surprising amount of barrel as well. Pretty sweet, but the roast keeps that in check.
Feel: Heavier end of medium bodied/lighter end of heavy. Maybe a 7/10. Really slick and oily, coats the tongue. Usually go for the thicker stouts, but with all the residual sugars, this works well. Also, an interesting dry finish. Maybe the oak coming to play a bit? 858 charactersSpinaltapped, Mar 11, 2016
3.48/5  rDev -21.1%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Batch #2, bottled Jan 25, 2016.  Poured into a snifter.
4.0 A:  Black color.  A short, short-lived beige head formed and left a single wisp of lacing.  Pretty standard for a beer this huge.
3.5 S:  Very surprisingly smell in terms of intensity.  For a 17% beer with coffee and barrel treatments, this is tame.  Even more crazy is that the booze isn't detectable at all.  Roasted barley, milder coffee, peaty bourbon.  Molasses, leather, touch of woody oak.  It smells good, but it's not impressive. 
3.25 T:  The flavor definitely picks up in the taste.  For starters, the booze show up and in a big way.  A ton of roastiness gives a hefty bitterness.  Leathery and peaty bourbon with a mild tannic astringency.  Coffee, light vanilla, molasses, caramel, and hints of licorice.  I get the feeling that the complexity and intensity of flavors found in this beer could easily be achieved at 10 or 12%.  The added alcohol seems unnecessary and only distracts from what the beer should be aiming for.  Bitterness lasts into the aftertaste.  I'd rather have a more formidable maltiness to balance it out.
4.0 M:  Heavier medium to heavy body.  Good moderate carbonation.  Pleasantly creamy.  A bit sticky, but much less chewy than a beer this big should be (which I tend to like at times).
3.5 D:  Eh, I'm really not that impressed.  The high ABV does nothing to pack in more flavor or complexity. 1,397 charactersDavoleBomb, Mar 11, 2016

It looks thick and fudgy. The quarter inch of initial head fades quickly, but it settles into a light tan-colored layer with plenty of lacing.
As soon as I poured it, I can smell the coffee and the booze from two feet away. With a nose in the glass, it still smells like coffee and bourbon, but also loads of milk chocolate. It smells like pure dessert. As it warms, I get more vanilla and oak from it. It starts to smell more like a creme brulee.
Taste is sweet fudge upfront, finishing with a blast of coffee that leaves a touch of bitterness. Delicious. The coffee and the high alcohol content definitely give it a bite.
The carbonation is well integrated. It doesn't quite have the thick chewiness of one of Evil Twin's stouts or BCBS, but it's close.
This is a fantastic BBA coffee stout. I think the coffee and the high ABV combine to give it a little too much bite -- some of the complexity of the base Mephistopheles stout is overshadowed -- but it is a delicious dessert beer. Also, the label says to serve at 50-60 degrees F, but I think it really starts to open up at nearly room temperature. Take your time with this one. 1,165 charactersccg, Mar 03, 2016

S - coffee, bourbon, molasses, dark chocolate, vanilla, oak

M - very heavy mouthfeel, sweet alcohol is very present, it's almost like drinking a coffee liqour. Aftertaste is coffee, coffee liqour, bourbon, molasses.
O - this is a hefty beer, but the point of these kinds of beers is to be exceptionally good, not just to be hefty. It's good, don't get me wrong, but it would be better with a lower abv. It's a little overly sweet, which makes its drinkability pretty low. I guess that's kind of a good thing at 18%abv. 722 charactersHopHunter19, Feb 25, 2016

The color is extremely dark brown, slightly light red around the ages. It has a thin tan head that slowly dissipates to a ring, leaving very little lacing.
The aroma starts with a huge whiff coffee. As I go on I get bit of sweetness and a hint of oak.
The taste is a big coffee flavor, with an equal amount of chocolate. This beer is SWEET! Lots of sticky molasses, a bit of vanilla. The big flavors finally recede, leaving me with a bit of warmth and traces of bourbon.
The mouthfeel has a lot of heat from the alcohol, but not unpleasantly so. It's creamy and silky, but with a medium amount of carbonation. It's quite heavy, almost syrupy.
I've never had a stout like this. Absent are any of the raisin or dark fruit flavors that are present in a lot of barrel aged beers. Instead, it has a huge coffee flavor alongside an extremely sweet flavor profile, and has a lot of the flavor notes of a bourbon. It's definitely the highest ABV beer I've had, and while you can tell, it's pleasant, like sipping a nice liqueur. 1,107 charactersjefewyatt, Feb 23, 2016

Lovely black as tar with fair amount of light brown/reddish foam which resolves quickly. Smells strongly of coffee, cocoa, leathery with a significant alcohol aspect. Tastes incredibly sweet, strong notes of bourbon, vanilla, cocoa, roasted malts, notes of coffee, molasses, brown sugar. Mouthfeel is almost like milk, little carbonation, fairly clean finish despite its malty profile. 
Overall, very pleasant. ABV well hidden by the complex flavor profile. Scrumptious – an excellent winter warmer and sipper.

Pours a deep brown, nearly black body with a light brown one finger head that reduces fairly slowly to leave spotty lacing and a layer of brown foam. 
Aromas are delectable.. freshly ground coffee, vanilla, chocolate, really nicely balanced bourbon. 
Tastes just as good as it smells.. starts off with bourbon, vanilla, chocolate, nicely balanced ground coffee, ends with a delicious roastyness. Not too sweet. Medium heavy body but not chewy. Medium low carbonation. A little alcohol but I would NEVER guess this is 17.5%. So damn drinkable. 
Finally.. a world class, delicious bourbon barrel coffee stout that I have access too.
This stuff is amazing. Not too sweet, amazing balance of coffee and bourbon, nice vanilla, excellent complexity. So impressed. 865 charactersgcamparone, Feb 20, 2016

Even after a year and quarter of aging, there is still about 1/3 inch of tan head after pouring. There is minimal lacing but it is dark as the other big name stouts. This beer packs a punch at 17.8%. I never had a beer so boozy. It has the very same end notes as high-end bourbon coming most likely from the abv and or the barrel. It is certainly bitter from the coffee and dark chocolate but it isn't nearly as balanced as Bourbon County Coffee. It steps from bitter coffee to overbearing whiskey. Definitely worth a try, but certainly a sipping beer. I'm not sure how much age if any would be required to mellow this monster of a stout 724 charactersTrevor11, Feb 17, 2016

L: Pours a mahogany brown but pitch black in the glass. Half a finger a a creamy mocha head that dissipated very quickly. 
N: Wow. HUGE espresso, coffee, chocolate, some roasty almonds, bourbon, and a bit of oak. Somehow not a single hint of alcohol on a 17.5% beer. 
T: Boom. Follows the nose quite well. Up front is the espresso and chocolate melding beautifully. On the back end you get the barrel, more coffee, and a touch of vanilla to round out the beer. I get a bit of heat on the way down but certainly nothing offputting. 
F: Great. Perhaps a tiny bit overcarbonated for my liking but a great medium to medium full mouth feel goes very well with the beer. 
Overall: Faaaaannntastic beer. I was expecting this thing to be overly sweet with the abv but Avery knocked this one out of the park. Gives BCBCS a big run for its money. 876 charactersryanmextorf, Feb 11, 2016

It all lingers on the tongue for a good minute. F: Chewy and viscous like motor oil. O: A really good BA imperial that could be even better if they dialed back the ABV. 438 charactersLADaveBN, Feb 08, 2016

Aroma is somewhat muted and really hard to pick out. Its definitely sweet - and my wife pins it as butterscotch - but its hard to isolate. Surprisingly, I don't get a lot of coffee or bourbon.
Okay, taste... There's so much going on and I feel unqualified to break this down, but here it goes. Its very sweet, I've had the mephistopheles and it was nothing like this. Whatever coffee and barrels they used for aging, I want them. Its absolutely delicious. Definitely some caramel and butterscotch on the front end, boozy bourbon show up later.
The body is nice and chewy, and I enjoy the developing flavors so much I have a hard time swallowing. 
Overall, this is definitely one of the most unique, complex stouts I've had the pleasure of tasting, and its going to be really, really hard to let the rest of these bottles age in the cellar. 977 charactersGreatStoutman, Feb 07, 2016

Aroma was not very strong; mostly notice the coffee and not much of the bourbon, surprisingly. Taste was okay; got the coffee, but the lasting impression here is how hot this brew is. You taste and feel all 18% of the ABV. Alcohol presence is quite strong. Think of black coffee with booze instead of creamer. This is closer to liquor than to beer. Overall, it's an okay novelty to me. Glad I got the 4oz poor as that is more than enough in my humble opinion. 516 charactersLouZ, Dec 19, 2015

12oz bottle split between a pair of Georgetown samplers. Bottled October 28, 2014. Batch Number 1.
Pours black with a moderate-sized (large for a barrel aged imperial stout) brown creamy head. Smell is yeasty, coffee, roasty, smokey. Lots of coffee. Moderate alcohol presence. 
Taste is a blast of sweetness and alcohol that pops my eyes out. Definitely some charcoaly smoke, definitely coffee, just a hint of butterscotch (that I wouldn't have picked out if my wife hadn't mentioned caramel). Coffee seems to come out more as I sip it a few more times, and balances out the sweetness a bit better. Makes it actually quite delicious, but the alcohol is just a bit of a detractor.
Mouthfeel is silky and gritty simultaneously.  Overall, very nice beer. 765 characterssnaotheus, Dec 06, 2015

Pours like a dark nightmare with little to no head. Smell is very boozy with coffee notes & chocolate to keep it honest. Taste is very good if you don't mind the bite of that 17%. You can only mask so much. Definitely a sipper. I would definitely get this again tho! A nice brew for watching a movie by the fireplace or sharing with a friend. 426 charactersNurhyme21, Dec 05, 2015

Look: Motor oil black with a tan head.  This beer just looks heavy.
Smell: Bourbon is immediately noticeable.  Notes of coffee, chocolate, vanilla, and oak as well.
Taste: Follows the smell pretty closely.  The bourbon is not as dominating as it was in the smell.  Even with a year on it, the coffee still came through significantly.  Chocolate and vanilla as well.
Feel: Heavy bodied and creamy.  Bourbon leaves a little burn on the back-end.  I thought it mellowed out considerably over the year.  Not too much carbonation.  
Overall: One of the better bourbon stouts I have had.  Really big at almost 19% ABV - definitely split this one with a friend if you can.  I think it was worth the $12 price tag. 764 characterstmryan21, Nov 09, 2015

4.73/5  rDev +7.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Thanks to jakehoodlum for this, a beer I missed when it passed through shelves in MN & have lusted after since two small pours at the brewery in July. 12 oz. gold-foiled bottle about to penetrate me. The beer, not the bottle.
The sound it makes glugging into the glass is identical to the many quarts of Valvoline I poured into my hapless 1980 Pinto many, many years ago. Looks like Quaker State, though. The head is small & banished quickly. The nose is canyon-deep bourbon, attendant vanilla, & large swath of sweetness. Good. 
Tweak fuckin’ rocks. The alcohol warms my lips, mouth, tongue, & everything it brushes against all the way down to my ureter. I instantly toss my car keys behind the dresser. Towering vanilla notes are offset by a blast of bourbon. The coffee/roast only arrives mid-palate, & there must be an entire small Central American bean plantation thrown in to make it evident against this crazy background. Big oak arrives late & sticks around, along with an indelible impression of sugary sweetness. Mouthfeel is just this side of Wisconsin maple syrup. Drinkable? Yes. I’d drink another tomorrow if I had one. Then another, if I could still find my fridge. Where are my car keys?
That sound you hear is brain cells screaming as they perish; but a few must die, that many would feel joy. This is a poster child for everything that is wrong – and right – with the current state of beer. Huge, complex, delicious. Simply magnificent. 1,465 charactersmaximum12, Sep 24, 2015

Alternately, you could just slice into wedges and serve...
Very dark brown, with foamy tan head that lats as a halo and some lacing.
Smells of coffee, chocolate, bourbon, and yes, Mr. Alcohol
Lots of coffee and chocolate up front. Bourbon comes in later and long dry alcohol finish.
Had to dock it a bit because alcohol just overwhelms balance. Very thick and chewy, significant burn. Not much carbonation, as you'd expect.
It's unlike anything I've had before. In a year, I might want one again. 545 charactersIvoryFoxhole, Sep 15, 2015

Aroma of dry coffee notes with some light alcohol, some roasted malt and some residual sugar notes. Taste is an extreme mix of huge floral coffee notes with some dry bitter roasted malt, some alcohol and some residual sugar notes. Body is full with good carbonation and some alcohol was apparent. Not sure I need to drink this on a regular basis but still quite drinkable considering the ingredients used in this beer. 531 charactersPhyl21ca, Sep 14, 2015

4.1/5  rDev -7%look: 4.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a snifter. 
Beer pours a very opaque black with the very slightest tinge of cherry on the edges. About one finger of bubbly head that dissipates quickly to a halo around the glass. 
Smells strongly of bourbon and coffee. Very slight hint of chocolate in the nose, but ever so subtle. 
Flavor is very strong of coffee up front. Coffee flavor dissipates and is followed by bourbon flavors. There is a hint of onion on the swallow. 
Feel is strong on the bourbon. Feels like one is drinking hard alcohol rather than a beer. 556 charactersAlpha309, Sep 11, 2015

(A)- Pours pitch black with a minimal tan colored frothy head
(S)- Some huge roasted coffee meets subtle cocoa richness. VERY rich smelling
(T)- Big on coffee and cocoa. Some great caramel and oaky vanilla on the finish
(M)- A HUGE beer. Big on alcohol and big on flavor. Bitter, but so rich and sweet that, you barely notice
(O)- This is not a shy beer. Big on everything, it is a barrage to the senses. Share with a friend or two cause this will kick your ass. A great stout nontheless, just not one I could enjoy all the time 568 characterssweemzander, Sep 10, 2015

With a twirl of the glass, slick curtains and legs easily melt from the sides of the glass.  This is a very fine looking imperial stout.  
Smell:  Sweetened dark chocolate and dark roasted malts.  French press.  Bourbon followed by some wood.  The  aromas coming from this stout are heavy and robust.     
Taste:  I had to sip on this beer a little while and let it warm more than usual, before the full flavors began to blossom.  It took my palate a little bit to accommodate the strong flavors.  The taste follows the smell.  Big and robust.  I sense a touch of cinnamon.      
Feel:  The feel is characteristic of a finely made stout.  This is thick, dense, and heavy in the mouth, with a nice amount of chewiness.  The lather is ultra fine and creamy.  This beer seems like it has two phases and transforms in your mouth after settling in.  It goes from a dense and heavy liquid to a semi-liquefied whipped cream in the bottom of your mouth.    
Overall -  A rare treat that I would not have too often. 1,108 charactersmabermud, Aug 22, 2015

Even some sweetness of caramel and molasses. Supremely drinkable, even at almost 18% ABV. Very silky and smooth. I cant wait to enjoy this beer again. 397 charactersSouth2NW, Jul 26, 2015

This is possibly my favorite barrel aged offering from Avery. Pitch black with a small tan head. Wonderful coffee aroma. There is an excellent sweetness to the beer which pairs nicely with the coffee flavor. As boozy as it is (and it hits like a truck), the alcohol is nicely hidden by the richness of the beer. The bourbon is present on the finish, but its not the star of the show as with KBS,BCBS, etc. Overall, one of the best beers I've ever had at such a high ABV. Hats off to Avery for this gem. 533 charactersTychoNDC, Jul 19, 2015

Color is completely black with a thin khaki head that fades quickly.  Nice lacing.  Smell is coffee, roasted malts, dark fruits and most definitely booze.  Flavor is really good - a nice blend of coffee, anise, some vanilla.  The alcohol bites at the end and makes it a sipping drink, but it is a very good sipper.   Body is medium-full - mouthfeel is sharp, due to the alcohol.  Overall, it's very tasty and full of flavor. 473 charactersmr-jj, Jul 12, 2015

feels warm and creamy and then a faint burn of bourbon on the way down.

Smell - The bourbon leads the way with coffee and sweet malts in the back. 
Taste - The bourbon is in a perfect symbiotic state with the coffee. The coffee is some hard core expresso. It is perfectly bitter black coffee. Also, notes of vanilla, oak, and sweet malts appear before the warming syrupy finish. 
Mouthfeel - Aside from being thick, the sweetness is sticky. Sweet and bitter coffee coats the tongue nicely. 
Overall - I love this. Since I love bitter black coffee, this is a homerun for me. 581 charactersJohnnyHopps, Jun 22, 2015

4.89/5  rDev +10.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 52014 reserve, served in a Speigelau Stout Glass
Look: This is one of the best looking beers I've ever seen, with a gorgeous dark brown head that dissipates quickly leaving a river of hellish blackness through which no light shines. I don't often remark on the aesthetics of beer, but this is a sight you don't see every day.
Smell: Bourbon and alcohol. Also a few subtle hints of coffee, but mostly alcohol and bourbon.
Taste: This is one hell of a beer. The bourbon hits you straight out of the gate like a wrecking ball, but I was expecting that based on my experience with other barrel aged  stouts like Parabola and Bourbon County. That said, after that initial gut punch, Tweak really opens up in a way that those other beers don't. Behind all this thickness lies a surprisingly complex beer. There's a whole lot to this beer, with bourbon, malts, and chocolate hitting the tongue one after the other, ending with subtle coffee notes that keep it from having the same sort of harsh, boozy aftertaste that plague most other barrel aged beers when they're new. It's the sort of taste that lingers for days, but with a taste like this, I eagerly look forward to that.
Feel: This is a brick. The next thickest beer I know of is Bourbon County, but that's nothing compared to this. But oh, what a brick it is.
Overall: At $12.50 for a 12oz bottle, this is a very expensive beer, and I took a big risk buying it. But- and I can't believe I'm saying this, given the ludicrous price- it's worth it, and I'll definitely see if I can find another bottle next time I'm near the bottle shop where I found it.
I don't rate a lot of beers here, but this is something else. A tremendously exciting beer hiding in a familiar shell, Tweak is something I'd recommend to any stout lover. It only gets better as it warms, which is a great thing- after all, given it's extreme richness and its  17.81% alcohol content, it's going to take me hours to finish this thing. Could this be the best beer I've ever tried? Maybe it could. 2,019 charactersSir_Whats-his-face, Jun 10, 2015

Huge boozy aroma of fresh coffee beans, various chocolates, and bourbon.  Very sticky, full mouthfeel that carries the intense flavor very well.  Finish is long, sticky and sweet but the booziness and whiskey cut through and balance it out.  Really outstanding.

Smell: Strong chocolate hinting at fudge, some coffee, big alcohol leaning towards bourbon. 
Taste: opens up with a little bit of chocolate and a good dose of coffee. chocolate returns after initial taste hinting more at fudge. towards the end alcohol burns through with quite a bit of bourbon. coffee grinds make occasional appearances. 
Mouthfeel: heavy and hinting at syrupy. slight boozy astringency and alcohol hot. 
Overall: very nice but I will take the regular mephistopholes over this one. not the biggest fan of coffee added to stouts but this one does well. the flavors are big and bold and the coffee is at an average level making the balance nice for me. 873 charactersSportsandJorts, May 10, 2015

Black colored beer with a thick brown colored head.
Smells decidedly boozy.  Scents of coffee and grapes.  Scent of chocolate and rum.  Scent of coconut.
Starts out sweet and strong chocolate.  Slight soy sauce taste.  Strong alcohol warmth in the chest.  Taste of berry and grapes.  Mild bitterness.  The alcohol does tend to numb your tongue.
Mouthfeel is gravy thick.
Overall worth a try once but I would buy something else in the future. 483 charactersZorro, May 03, 2015

4.51/5  rDev +2.3%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4Poured into a Fremont small snifter.  Pours pitch black with a thin dark brown head that dissipates to a thin film and ring around the glass. Aroma of dark toasted malt, chocolate, bourbon, vanilla and hints of coffee. Flavor is rich bourbony, chocolatey dark toasted malt, oaky vanilla and light quality coffee with a very light hint of char. Medium to heavy creamy bodied with nice carbonation and mouth fell. The massive ABV of this stout is almost complete covered by the flavor. Although it is quite strong and warming, the rich flavors completely cover any booziness. A wonderfully balanced blend of dark malt, chocolate, coffee and bourbon oak barrel flavors. Amazing and well done. Mephistopheles was one of my first truly eye-opening beers and this is an amazing powerful version of it. The beast series of ales has been around a long time and still are at the top of their class. A hard to find, hyped beer that lives up to its reputation. 949 charactersLiquidAmber, Apr 29, 2015

Appearance: Pours pitch black with a moderate amount of carbonation. Slight finger of tan head that settles into a thin creamy layer. 
Smell: A rich, roasty, and nicely boozy dark malt driven aroma with big hints of dark chocolate, coffee, and bourbon. Dark roasted barley malt with big hints of dark chocolate, coffee beans, toast, biscuit, smoke, caramel, and yeast. Barrel hints of bourbon whiskey, vanilla, and oak. Subtle dark fruit hints of raisin, cherry, and fig. Sweet hints of molasses and black licorice. A pretty good rich aroma. 
Taste: Like the smell hints at, a rich, roasty, and boozy dark malt driven taste with huge notes of dark chocolate, coffee, and bourbon. Dark roasted barley malt with big upfront notes of bitter dark chocolate, coffee beans, smoke, burnt toast, biscuit, caramel, and yeast. The barrel presence comes through with notes of bourbon whiskey, vanilla, and oak. Sweet notes of molasses. Some black licorice as well. Subtle dark fruit undertones of raisin, fig, and cherry. A really good taste. 
Mouthfeel: Full bodied with a moderate level of carbonation. Very rich and fairly syrupy. There is some noticeable alcohol heat as expected but things are surprisingly smooth considering the extreme ABV. 
Overall: A really great Barrel Aged Coffee Stout. Big chocolate and coffee flavors with a nice bourbon presence. It’s amazing how smooth it is. This is up there with Bourbon County and the big Michigan stouts. 1,524 charactersMattyG85, Apr 11, 2015

On tap at Avery. Awesome. The chocolate and bourbon are much more prominent than the coffee. Still good amount of coffee comes through. How do they make an 18% ABV beer taste so smooth. 209 characterskkleu357, Apr 10, 2015

A small and deep brown colored head forms and hangs around just a little bit then turns into a ring on the edge of the glass. Not much lacing, but there are plenty of alcohol legs to be had.
S- Right up front on the nose is a huge dose of bourbon barrel consisting of booze, sweet vanilla, and an oak spice that borderlines on cinnamon. The coffee and dark malts mix in after the barrel aging and provide coffee and fudge flavors in the scent. The coffee isn't dominant, but that could be attributed to my lack of a sense of urgency in getting around to this beer.
T- Holy bourbon and booze up front! The barrel assaults the tongue as soon as it hits and hits you not only with its flavors, but also with the burn of the alcohol content. As soon as the alcohol finishes its attempt to tear your tongue out, the coffee flavor hits in a big, roasty, and bitter profile. The barrel flavors mingle in with the coffee and try to lighten it with some sweetness, but the vanilla  can't stand up to the power of the coffee and oak spice. At the back end of the drink the coffee tries to linger, but the alcohol returns and adds its pure bitterness in to become the dominant flavor.
M- Not as thick and smooth as expected with the high alcohol and generous malt bill, but still a fairly smooth drink to sip on. The burn is real in this beer in the taste, the feel, and the warming burn on its way down.
Overall, this beer is extremely powerful. If I were to compare it to a beer of similar alcohol content, say a Black Tuesday, it really feels stronger and is less drinkable. In the end, it is very good, but due to the alcohol and barrel flavor, it pretty much drinks like a bourbon. 1,735 charactersboilermakerbrew, Apr 06, 2015

Raisins, fudge, and tons of coffee. Vanilla and wood. 
I love the coffee and wood interplay. Layers of flavors ranging from dark fruits, dates, brownies, vanilla. Boozy, but at this abv surprisingly drinkable. 
Full and soft mouthfeel. Moderate carbonation. Boozy and a sipper. 
What a great beer. Complex and robust. It's one to sip on at the end of the night. 493 charactersVonerichs, Apr 02, 2015

A- Pours a fully opaque black color with a 1/2 inch soft medium brown head that retains well before becoming a thin ring around the edge of the glass and minimal surface foam.  Nearly no lacing.
S- Lots of barrel character with notes of dark chocolate and light coffee trailing behind.  Also some peanut butter, plenty of booze fume and a hint of brown sugar. 
T- Ah, sonofabitch that's awesome.  How they got all the flavors to marry so perfectly, I'll never know.  Big barrel presence with some solid chocolaty sweetness and dark roast coffee to round everything out.  Charry aftertaste.  More peanut butter is found.  It's hard for me to keep from taking multiple sips as I want this 12 oz bottle to last for a while.   Fudge starts coming out more as it warms.  As it completely warms, the roast bitterness starts getting a bit out-of-hand.  Heed others' warnings to share the bottle.
M- Kind of burns going down but the creamy mouthfeel, low carbonation and fullest of bodies makes it all worth it.
O- Believe the hype.  This one is amazing.  The coffee acts as a complementary addition to the profile rather than being the star of the show.  The key player is the barrel as it adds depth and complexity to the power of the base stout.  Remarkably smooth yet should still be savored slowly as the flavors are strong and decadent. 1,423 charactersImmortale25, Apr 01, 2015

If you love imp. stouts you will love this beer and I will go on a limb to suggest you will like this more than whatever your current favorite stout is.  Get it if you see it. Really expensive?....yes. Part with the cash for a one time splurge, think of it as a gift to yourself. Stout lovers you will not regret it.
I only docked the taste because the giant alcohol presence but take it for what its worth because @17.81% ABV its still masked better than some that are half that much and lower. 
I only dock the feel because Im being modest and I cant remember it well enough. 689 charactersDragonsMilk, Mar 29, 2015

Smell: coffee is earthy, caramel, with a slight smokiness; also prune, mild roast, booze sweetness. Taste: brownie batter, dark chocolate, earthy, vanilla, caramelized fig, some bourbon mostly as boozy sweetness. Big flavors, lots of booze, but commendably not overly sweet. Full bodied, relaxed carb, boozed finish. Not earthshattering but quite good. 452 charactersbabaracas, Mar 29, 2015

Beer poured black with a beautiful brown head that is still hanging around mid-glass.  Somewhat unusual for a high abv brew.
Nose is primarily barrel and is quite nice.  Getting a hint of mocha sweetness too.
Taste is near perfection.  The melding of the coffee and barrel along with the barrel flavors of oak and vanilla on top of a very nice roasted imperial stout is awesome.  
Mouthfeel is full and very smooth, almost perfection.
Overall this beer is worth the price of admission.  The alcohol was warming with the first sip but amazingly pretty much rendered to the background the rest of the way.  No need to age this one as it is ready to go now!  Hats off to the Avery family for a masterful brewing and blend! 812 charactersarizcards, Mar 28, 2015

4.35/5  rDev -1.4%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Appearance- Pitch black in color.  About one fingers worth of head.  The head is mocha colored with an almost red hue to it.  
Aroma-  Massive amounts of coffee which really overshadows everything else.  A little booze is noticeable along with some rich dark chocolate sweetness.
Taste- Roasted coffee is big at first and really lingers into the finish, but at no point is it overly bitter.  The coffee is balanced by a sweet dark chocolate and a mild bourbon presence.  Almost forgot this barrel aged for second as the coffee dominates this throughout.  
Feel- Dense, full bodied, low carbonation, warming alcohol in the stomach, and despite being almost 18% abv the malt does not linger for too long.  
Overall- The biggest coffee stout I've ever had and it isn't close.  This makes FBS look like chocolate milk.  Yet, despite how massive this beer is, there is great balance between the roasted coffee and sweetness from the dark chocolate and bourbon barrel.  If your're looking for a coffee stout this is a must try, but if your're looking for a beer that showcases the barrel aging this isn't it.  The barrel is simply a compliment and a great one at that. 1,166 charactersCTbrew32, Mar 27, 2015

S: 4.25 Big and boozy are the first things that come to mind. There’s some coffee, earthiness, and roasted malt in the mix of course, but the bourbon really takes center stage. Vanilla, chocolate, and raspberries appear as the beer opens up. Not the most balanced, but certainly more than other coffee stouts.
T: 4.75 Here is where all that booze is really put to good use. Unlike most beers of this style that are too heavy on the coffee, the bourbon allows things to be more balanced. The first thing that hits you is big bold flavors of maple syrup, molasses, chocolate, vanilla, bourbon, and berries. The coffee is still quite strong and very pleasant, but the other flavors are so intense that it’s forced to be balanced. There’s a slight booziness and bitterness on the finish, but it’s hardly a critique considering the robustness of this beer.
M: 4.75 Of course, this beer is very thick and substantial, but not as heavy as expected. It’s actually rather easy drinking with a slightly dry finish.
O 4.75 I’m wowed by this beer. I tend to shy away from coffee stouts, but there’s so much going on while remaining balanced that it really works here. Definitely the best example of this style I’ve had to date, including BCBCS.

A- Dark black body, oily and thick as all heck. One finger brown head that dissipates quickly. Leaves a creamy medium sized collar that lingers for a long time. A foreboding dark liquid with a lot of legs, more than a spider.
S- Tons of whiskey, oak and chocolate. It's actually a bit difficult to smell the coffee here, but it's there as a roasted coffee bean presence. But the whiskey hits you in the nose, and hits you good. Whoa. Very intense nose full of dark chocolate, oak and bourbon with a splash of espresso.
F- The espresso comes out more on the palate. Not oxidized at all, a nice substantial espresso contribution with oak, dark chocolate, whiskey and sugar. Essentially, it's an espresso with a shot of bourbon and a packet or two of sugar. I don't know what the Italian name for this blend of coffee would be, but it's definitely potent and flavourful.
M- Thick bodied, a bit oily and sticky with a fair amount of heat on the backend. This one will creep up on you if you're not careful.
O- Intense, flavourful stout with a nice espresso flavour. In keeping with Avery's special 12oz bottled beers, it is super high in ABV and well, just be careful. It reminds me a lot of Mocha Wednesday. 1,268 charactersStevedore, Mar 07, 2015

Appearance: Black body. Head was a thick, dark creamy foam one-half finger deep. Lacing was absent.
Smell: Espresso, malt, plums.
Taste: Alcohol is overpowering. Espresso, chocolate, fruit and bourbon.
Mouthfeel: Full-bodied. Dry with some bitter. Left a “fuzzy” tongue with the espresso taste. 
Overall: Too much alcohol. But is should be good after 5 years in a cellar. 415 charactersKansasBeerLover, Mar 07, 2015

There are some nice barrel characteristics, slight chocolate sweetness and bourbon in the aroma and the flavor, but burnt coffee is the headliner, which isn't a good thing. Smells much better than it taste, and that's always disappointing in any beer. It may get better with a few years on it, once the alcohol and coffee fade more... but that's a little bit of a cop-out. 437 charactersmig100, Feb 22, 2015

4.6/5  rDev +4.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Gold foil capped 12oz bottle from BeerShip.com. Bottled 10/28/14. Served in a Three Floyds teku. 
Pours oil black with two fingers of mocha head. Despite the fairly consistent halo, the only "lace" is a half ring of crust that dried towards the top of the glass while I allowed the brew to reach room temperature. 
Full, lush aromas of creamed coffee, bourbon, chocolate, caramel, molasses, coconut and a nip of alcohol. Smells outstanding- like a booze infused chocolate coffee cake. 
Right from the first sip (and this IS a sipper) the flavors of bold coffee and dark chocolate show their huge presence along with a big serving of booze. Molasses, burnt oak, fudge, dark fruits, coconut, vanilla, brown sugar, heavily roasted malts, eathy bitter pine root and some vague peppery spice. I can't call it finesse but it develops nicely as it warms. Much like Mephistopheles, this can be enjoyed slowly over the course of a couple hours to allow the depth of flavors to come out. 
Viscous, heavy body with a bit more carbonation than expected for such a big bruiser of a beer. Boozey heat carries through to the finish along with espresso, dark chocolate and bourbon. 
Tweak is another excellent example of Avery's ability to deliver the phenominal and thouroughly unsubtle side of brewing. It's not a beer for someone who can't take a little burn along with a potent dose of flavor. I love Avery's big beers and this is no exception. I initially feared that I might have purchased too many but I suspect I'll be pretty darn happy with my "investment" over the next five years or so. 1,586 charactersThickNStout, Feb 18, 2015

3.65/5  rDev -17.2%look: 5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 3.25 |  overall: 3.5Brief write-up. It looks amazing - the retention seems impossible for 18%. The aroma is also great, like a coffee-infused chocolate cake devoid of booze. The taste, though, is really hot. But it's only hot if you leave it in the mouth - just drinking it, it's nice and smooth. Naturally, the chocolate, coffee, bourbon, and dark fruit flavors are massive, as is the lingering sweetness. Letting it reach room temp will help balance it out, though it remains too sweet throughout. While it's fairly likable, it's just way too over the top for it's own good.

Smells of faint coffee and that familiar Avery coconut-sweet bourbon. 
Taste starts with coffee then quickly goes into that Avery coconut-bourbon combo with a solid amount of heat. Coffee comes in strongest in the finish/aftertaste. 
Feels pretty syrupy and oily, low carbonation and a bit thin. 
This could be great but the heat definitely takes away from the best aspects of the beer. Needs more a bit more carbonation and a thicker body. 519 charactersSteveD082791, Feb 01, 2015

Flavor profile: Coffee and espresso. Roasted malts. Big chocolate flavors. Massive malt bomb. Caramel, toffee, brown sugar, molasses. Vanilla and bourbon come through nicely. Reminds me a bit of kbs, but much bigger. 
I don't understand where people get a huge alcohol burn or flavor. To me, the 18% is hidden very well. It shows in the finish a tad, but not bad.
Mouthfeel: Roasted and silky smooth. Full bodied.
Overall, a solid brew. Definitely something worth trying. The nose on this beer is fantastic. 557 charactersmothman, Feb 01, 2015

S: Guatemalan coffee, Mexican vanilla, bourbon, and alcohol esters. A dry roastiness is also present. 
T: Heavy licorice notes, alcohol burn, a hint of coconut, with a thick and creamy chocolate finish. Wow, this is rich and powerful. There's no subtlety here whatsoever. Ground coffee becomes more pronounced with more sipping. 
M: Mouthfeel is syrupy and thick with molasses, cocoa, and alcohol burn. 
O: While I am a tad let down by the hype, this is still a delicious sledgehammer of flavor. With my Imperial Stouts, I prefer more sophistication, but this still approaches greatness. 728 charactersRanz, Jan 30, 2015

Aroma: Boozy but not as bad as other beers, it actually smells like a beer should. Some booze in the aroma but more chocolate, coffee and malts. Smells like a regular BA imperial stout!
Taste: Not too boozy really for what it is, coffee, chocolate and some roasted malts are prominent. But the booze is not all that strong surprisingly. Thus far this is one of the better BA stouts I have had!
Overall: Nice beer. I totally enjoyed this one! 654 charactershumuloner22, Jan 27, 2015

4.47/5  rDev +1.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Original score 3.96 of batch one. Jet fuel in the nose and taste. Mouthfeel was thin and extremely boozey. It was a disappointment for sure.
Review of batch 2:
12 fl oz bottle sealed with gold foil and pressure cap.
5 oz sample poured into unbranded tulip glass.
Appearance: dark black and a thick cap of khaki head.
Smell: Acrid and really roasty coffee with big sweet bourbon notes. Nice oak presence in the aroma too.
Taste: Really well balanced between the strong aggressive coffee beans and the sweet bourbon and stouts profile. The coffee is like strong black coffee with a lot of roast presence and a hint of nutty coffee bean. Milk chocolate and dark chocolate presence in the stout base.  Vanilla, caramel, leather, and oak presence from the barrel.  This does have a little boozey taste, but what do you expect for 17.5% ABV? All things consider this is a huge improvement from batch one because this was a flaw of batch one it tasted like jet fuel it was soo boozey. 
Mouthfeel: full bodied stout. low carbonation. Oily and thick feel. Just a hint of dryness from the barrel. Again it is a little boozey, but the coffee and richness of the beer do a pretty stellar job of hiding the massive ABV of tweak.
Overall: Tweak has totally redeemed itself. Batch one was bad compared to this vintage. Really glad to try this again and have expectations met with batch 2. Avery barrel aging is always fantastic whether its a huge barrel aged stout or a fantastic wild ale. This is my second choice when I cant get my hands on any bourbon county coffee. 1,562 characters4DAloveofSTOUT, Jan 21, 2015

A: Predictably dark. No head. Hints of clinging lace.
S: Coming right off a KBS, I'm hit by the sweetness/bourbon-ness with the coffee receding into the background but still zippy enough to perk my interest. Mmmm, and now it's flipped. Such balance. Such richness. Yum.
T/M: Hot and harsh and boozy, as is the case with many of these Avery bigguns. Granted, it's fresh, but still...Especially transitioning from such a stellar nose. Loads of ground coffee, hints and whiffs of the hard stuff, with a long, lingering, bitter toffee-chocolate-burnt finish. Surprisingly thin for such a BIG beer.
O: Good by brute force if nothing else. Might recommend. 753 charactersAgentMunky, Jan 17, 2015

Almost black.  Smooth but potent bourbon notes in the nose.  The flavor profile includes a healthy dose of roasted malt and coffee with a sweet finish.  The various flavors blend together so well.
The alcohol warmth on the finish gets to the edge of intrusive but it is not nearly harsh enough to ruin an exquisite drinking experience. 378 characters57md, Jan 16, 2015

A-  Pours a very dark black with a thin creamy mocha head that has decent retention.
S-  Chocolate fudge, vanilla, oak, bourbon, light coffee, some underlying alcohol.  Very sweet and decadent smelling, can definitely smell the booze there but for the abv hides it nicely.
T-  Very sweet chocolate fudge, bitter baker's cocoa, cocoa powder, vanilla, oak, plenty of booze, light coffee (was expecting a bit more), bourbon that adds to the sweetness.  
M-  Very thick and viscous, can definitely taste the alcohol and has a burn going down but not too bad for the ~18% (just wouldn't suggest taking a big gulp), carbonation fairly lively and consistent- could maybe do with it toned down a little bit due to the style.
O-  Tweak is just another one of those over-hyped ultra-sweet gimmicky high-abv beers.  As far as beers in the 18% realm go this is pretty decent, just above Black Tuesday in my opinion but not better then the variants.  Definitely a sipper and probably enjoyed over the course of at least an hour or two if consuming solo. 1,089 charactersjaasen64, Jan 14, 2015

A-pours a jet black color with a small creamy dark brown head  that reduces to a film on top, leaving some lacing behind

T- bitter coffee up front with dark chocolate fudge brownie, lots of booze mixes with barrel flavor and oak barrel 
M- medium body with low carbonation leads to a big boozy mouthfeel that continues into the finish

Halfway through my glass I listened to it.  Just way too bitter and acidic, not a pleasant drinking experience at all.  There is no comparison here to BCS / BCBCS IMO. 277 charactersbowzer4birdie, Jan 12, 2015

A - Coffee body with a quarter finger of khaki head.  Low retention and lace.

S:  Booze, a little dark fruit, cherries & raisins get stronger as this warms
T: Follows the nose, oakyness, baker's chocolate, raisins, dryness & a hint of coffee up front.  A little caramel & vanilla as this warms, chocolate & a little bing cherry as well, some dark chocolate, more booze, seems more like Bourbon, that's just good blending.  Finishes dry, warming with nice chocolate & yes,  Bourbon notes
MF: Thick, some carbonation, but faint, warming, smooth
Pricey, but since I didn't get any BCBS, I can afford it, I would buy this despite the cost, drinks like a stout with half the ABV 728 charactersrusspowell, Jan 11, 2015

3.86/5  rDev -12.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.75The beer pours  jet black with a thin tan head that fades quickly, but still lingers around the circumference. The nose is booze-forward followed by coffee and some caramel/vanilla sweetness. It drinks with slightly charred grain and aggressive booze upfront, bourbon barrel, malty sweetness, coffee bitterness, and lingering  toasted oak. There is minimal carbonation, thick and rich coffee and bourbon, but abrasive ethanol that really hurts the drinkability. This beer has huge flavors and I can understand the appeal, but have little desire to try it again. 561 charactersThePorterSorter, Jan 11, 2015

Coal black body with a wispy, dark tan head. Rich, dark aroma; dates and figs; booze; vanilla. Big alcohol warmth with a spicy, chocolate backbone. Heavy body with a burning heat.
Boozy bitterness is the game. There's some chocolate malt and roasted grain notes, too, but they're very much subdued by the high ABV. And, if one can bypass the alcohol heat, there is some semblance of coffee in the mix, too. Ah, it ain't a bad beer for what it is, but it's hard to get excited by anything other than its hammer-like presence of rough, dark husky grains and loud-ass booze. I suppose, for me, it's a love/hate kind of thing as I really do enjoy heavy, dark, boozy beers, yet this one just seems way too rough around the edges... 774 charactersbeergoot, Jan 08, 2015

Look: pours an incredibly thick-looking dark brown, with a tiny amount of light brown foam.
Smell: chocolate, booze, some rye-like spiciness, oak.
Taste: coffee, chocolate, tons of booze. Not particularly sweet, with lots of other bitter/spicy flavors going on. Less "complex" than just a bit of a mess.
Feel: as thick as it looked. Pretty dry, with some bite and alcohol heat.
Overall: there are some really promising elements here, but it doesn't quite all come together for me. Too much bitterness and too boozy, both of which might settle down with some age. 632 charactersneurobot01, Jan 04, 2015

The beer pours an inky, jet black color, very thick and creamy out of the bottle, intensely opaque with a thick, taut and firm caramel colored head, about a finger and a half high, moderate retention, settling into a thin layer of film around the circumference of the glass and leaving a few soapy spots behind. The aroma is really big, plenty of coffee, bitter, roasty, but with some nice fruit character that brings out the chocolate, very rich and decadent, light bourbon, charred oak and complimenting stone fruits until the alcohol and barrel heat wash over the nose. The flavors match well, plenty of lightly roasted coffee straight away, a touch of acidity and fruit, nicely integrated with the chocolate, rich grain, stone fruits, charred oak, smooth bourbon with a huge sweet alcohol rush that neuters the palate. The mouthfeel is nice, very coating and thick but with very lively carbonation, perhaps a touch prickly, that finishes very easily but with a assertive warming sensation. 
Verdict: A massive beer, but a very nice coffee stout from Avery. Rich and decadent, not too sweet, not too bitter, but the alcohol is obviously assertive, though it doesn't make this beer cloying, which is greatly appreciated. Ambitious and well executed, well done Avery. The barrel aging program they have going has been outstanding, and this is just another example of their prowess. 1,455 characterskevanb, Jan 02, 2015

4.08/5  rDev -7.5%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Bottled 10/28/14. Shocked that I happened upon this brew. 12oz. bottle into a Cigar City snifter. Shared with schen9303.
This massive brew pours a 1 finger dark mocha colored head with moderate to low retention. Beer is viscous and pitch black. Lacing is spotty and patchy with little stick. Immense oily legs coat the glass. Pretty enticing.
Nose is exactly as predicted. Huge hints of coffee covered by waves of booze. Some notes of dark fruit, sweet soy sauce, fudge and vanilla smooth out the experience but this one is hugely aromatic.
Opens chocolate, leather, tobacco, soy sauce and booze. Hints of fudge, cocoa powder, and more sweet soy sauce in the middle with big helping of booze and just the slightest dash of coffee in the end and aftertaste. Finishes hot and messy with a lingering, molasses, prune, and chocolate and vanilla aftertaste. Solid. 
Full bodied with low carbonation. Boozy and hot in the mouth and burns the throat going down. Super rich and viscous. Messy finish with an aftertaste that sticks to the palate seemingly forever. Maybe a touch over the top but appreciatively rich and delightful.
I'm a fan of Mephistopheles stout but the coffee infusion is a bit lost in this one. A really over-the-top beer that is well appreciated as a nightcap but this isn't that different from the original. 1,327 charactersSpeedwayJim, Dec 31, 2014

4.21/5  rDev -4.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Look-pours a deep, opaque brown, with a half finger of dark brown head that settles into a thin layer of lacing.
Smell-Rich, toasted malt upfront. next comes lots of fresh coffee beans. chocolate and faint booze in the background.
Taste-Like the nose, rich, toasted malt flavors upfront, such as biscuit, brown sugar, hints of dark fruity notes, coffee, chocolate, booze is present in the finish providing warmth, but far from overpowering. 
Feel- Full bodied, carbonation is nearly absent. heavy but not oily. o=evaporates nicely off of the tongue.
overall- very nice beer. the booze is very well hidden, fans of complex stouts that are not overly sweet will love this one. well worth trying at least once. 707 charactersSteveB24, Dec 29, 2014

Batch No. 1
Bottled OCT 28 2014
Served in a snifter
Dark mahogany appearance. A bit thinner than expected. A near one-finger tall, bubbly, burnt sienna head topped the liquid and slowly dropped to a thick, frothy ring that had amazing lasting strength (especially considering this beer's extremely high ABV).
Really solid and punchy aroma. Coffee grounds came through strong, but this was far from a coffee bomb. Loads of bourbon and sweet brown sugar. Not super boozy however. Hefty dose of dark chocolate. Vanilla was noticeable, and it came out more as the beer warmed.
The flavor profile was intense. Although the beer was super boozy, I might guess this to be 3-4 percentage points lower than its actual ABV. Dark roasted coffee was immediately apparent. Boatloads of sweet caramel malts, molasses and brown sugar. Vanilla came through strong. Good dose of dark chocolate. The beer was definitely more mocha-like than I anticipated. Bourbon notes appeared on the back and and in the finish. Quite oaky. There was a moderate amount of roast (and a touch of char) here as well. Some unexpected, earthy hops were also detectible. An intense booziness lingered long after every sip.
On the palate, the liquid was super frothy and milk shake-like. Tongue blanketing. Full bodied for the style, yet perhaps more rich and creamy than thick and viscous.
Tweak is a terrific bourbon barrel-aged and coffee-infused imperial stout that truly lives up to the moniker of "extreme." This twelve ounce bottle would be a perfect nightcap to share with a couple of friends. 1,638 charactersDamian, Dec 28, 2014

4.52/5  rDev +2.5%look: 5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A: This poured an opaque black with thick dark tan head.
S: It smelled like sugary molasses and rich mocha, with some toasted coconut and vanilla and oak and fig.
T: It tasted like sugary espresso and rich dark chocolate, with some fig and toasted coconut. It had a lasting mostly sweet aftertaste with some alcohol warming.
M: It was very thick with a little carbonation. Excellent gigantic body.
D: This was a great brew, with bold and beautiful scent and taste. The body was perfect, and the finish was relatively smooth considering the ABV. Should be sipped and savored anyway. Surprisingly drinkable fresh, but it could surely last a long time in the cellar. Somewhere between WWS and Black Tuesday. 704 charactersPencible, Dec 28, 2014

a - brew pours a lush deep black.  great shine...not midnight, the real middle of the night.  thin creamy deep tan that hung around.  super attractive.  lush not sludgy.
s - nose screams awesome.  deep rich gourmet coffee melded with godiva chocolate...everything is in the right place.  this is what mocha wednesday wishes it was.  the wood comes across in a big way and is just right.
t/m/o - WOW!  huge beer.  everything the nose said is turned up to 11 on the taste.  the first thing i noticed was the silky feel with such lush chocolate and robust gourmet coffee.  big and boozy, but more than manageable.  avery really does these big beers so well.  the price point is tough, but they almost always make it worth it.  this one is no exception.  you like coffee bourbon barrel aged stouts you say?  then this is a MUST try. 895 characterscosmicevan, Dec 23, 2014

Coffee, molasses, licorice, vanilla, and bourbon notes.
A blast of coffee, molasses, and bourbon explode immediately, soon notes of chocolate and additional roasted notes come out as well.
Heavy-bodied, light carbonation, oily, sweet start, earthy bitter finish that lingers on the palate.
Overall, this really exceeded my expectations for this. After seeing the ABV, I was so sure that this would be too much and would need some age, but that was definitely not the case. It's delicious fresh, and I have one resting in my cellar to see what a year or two does to it. 655 characterslarryarms847, Dec 20, 2014

3.84/5  rDev -12.9%look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 3.75Bottle from Tipples. Pleasantly surprised to see this hit Florida distro. Pricey as hell at $15 a bottle but had to try it once. Pours nearly pitch black--not quite as thick looking as Uncle Jacobs or Black Eye--with a nicely forming dark brown head on top. Aroma of beautiful vanilla and licorice, some coffee, dark fruits, molasses, chocolate. Picks up the bourbon tones without smelling like a shot of bourbon. Smells soft and smooth and very nice. Taste is sweet molasses and cocoa, a bit of coffee spice, with a sweet boozy finish that leaves a bit of vanilla and a bit of earthy coffee left coating the palate. Some metallic notes. Boozy for sure, much thinner than I had hoped but still big and rich. I’m not a fan of Mephistopheles, honestly, and I feel like that dislike is coming through a bit here relative to its peers like Uncle Jacobs and Black eye. But it’s definitely an improvement over the base by miles and a solid after dinner sipper. 958 charactersBMMillsy, Dec 20, 2014

Considering it is over 17% abv it was incredibly smooth and tame on the booziness.

Thanks Nick!
Poured a pitch black color with 1-to-2 fingers of dark tan frothy head that thinned up rather quickly.  Minimal lacing on the sides of the glass. Below average retention on the top. (Sight - 3.50)
Smelled rich, roasty coffee beans, wet cocoa, dark chocolate, caramel, toffee, some smokiness, bourbon, chocolate fudge and crayon. (Smell - 4.00)
Definitely a unique taste. The 17.81 percent ABV comes in right away, followed by black coffee, roasted coffee beans, dark chocolate, wet cocoa, crayon, chocolate fudge, toffee, caramel, bourbon,  Kahlúa and dark chocolate milkshake. (Taste - 4.00)
Full body. Sticky texture. Average carbonation. Long, smooth, warming finish. (Feel - 4.50)
A pretty damn good beer and perfect for the winter. Looking back, I may have underrated it a tad. I keep thinking about it. Oh well. (Overall - 4.00)

Look: Black as the dark one's backside. Gorgeous mocha lead. 
Smell: Rich decadent, espresso, bourbon in the background, some dry, some sweet. Badass.
Taste: I just can't imagine a more satisfying taste....maybe some brews will compete but they'll come out a draw at best imo. Espresso, roast, bitter-sweet chocolate. Rich and decadent.
Overall: Just a wonderful creation from the wizards at Avery. 594 characterscindyjeffsmith, Dec 14, 2014

Appearance: Pitch black, tan creamy head lingers, completely disappeared. Very thick, oily, sloshes around the glass, very little carbonation.
Aroma: Bourbon, alcohol, I am not getting anything else.
Taste: Bourbon, some coffee bitterness, then right into some big alcohol burn, the alcohol is the most prominent flavor.
Mouthfeel: Very thick, dry, alcohol burn, little to no carbonation.
Overall: This is a big beer, lots of alcohol, there's not a lot of bourbon, there's more in other BA stouts, there's a slight, passing coffee bitterness right before the alcohol burn starts. This leaves a really dry finish, just a little too much alcohol for me, I bet this ages really well. 728 charactersBrolo75, Dec 08, 2014

A- Thick midnight oil black pour to three glasses for the share with a medium mocha cap. The head has a frothy, silky texture and forms to over a finger even after splitting with nice retention. A wide band remains at the edges and spotty lace results.
S- Dessert blast or should I say explosion out of the glass in the aroma. Like some sort of mega decadent chocolate brownie made with coffee and a splash of Bourbon. Even some toasted nuts coming to mind. Oak, vanilla and alcohol hints complete the show.
T- Bourbon really opens up here, quite a lot. Heavy coffee and chocolate still run the show but the barrels make a huge difference at this point. Espresso, cocoa powder, brownies, vanilla sweets, toasted oak, burnt sugar and certainly quite a hit of alcohol.
MF- Massively thick and oily body splashes down on the palate with a creamy and somewhat foamy texture. Carbonation comes in at a pretty high level. Finishes beyond warm, well hot to be exact.
Has some Uncle Jacobs feel, some Meph feel but the coffee really opens this up as it falls in right at home with a beyond rich chocolate flavor. This one is hot but honestly not in a bad way, just more of a sipper. Add in that Bourbon barrel flavor and you have yourself a brew to remember. 1,365 characterscbutova, Dec 08, 2014

A: almost solid black.  Head doesn't stay formed, but initially build to maybe a half finger.  The foamy head is dark tan and graces the surface of the beer sparsely throughout the pour.  Edge lacing stays as well, but provide very little lacing.  Nose nice roasted malt chocolate and coffee.  To be honest I expected more of the latter, but there is still a strong chocolate and coffee scent from this beer.
The taste starts cola like, with the carbonation and/or alcohol feel starting right up front.  This of course mellows as the beer warms.  When it is warmer, the front taste is more like coffee ice cream, but not as creamy.  There's a nuttiness to the flavors as well.  The tastes are quite nice, but I find it hard to break them from the alcohol heat that pervades the taste.  I think there are some nice flavors in this beer, specifically hints of dark roast coffee, dark oily nut, and (you might laugh but...) alcohol-filled chocolates.  Perhaps due to the alcohol, this beer stays on the slightly bitter/tart side of dark chocolate.
This is definitely a sipping beer, like many from this Avery series.  Letting it come to temp is helpful, but the prevalent alcohol detracts from the entire experience in my mind.  It will be really interesting how this beer tastes with some aging. 1,324 characterscjgiant, Dec 07, 2014

This one is pretty special, as colossal in its structure and booze as any beer in the market. Looks still in the glass, maybe bubbles can't cruise up through such a thick liquid. Milk chocolate and toffee not coffee are what I smell first. The bourbon is also evident, sweet and boozy and sticky. The taste is where the coffee shows up. Earthy and intensely black, like a mess up on the drip machine ratios. The vanilla in the bourbon really plays well with the coffee, and mores of coconut, fresh tobacco, and smoldering oak all come to prominence at varying stages of the longest finish in the world. It's boozy for sure, but I don't think it's distracted by it, and I certainly wouldn't have guessed it's quite this strong! Overall another must try from Avery in this very special series, but sip slowly people, this bottle can get you tipsy pretty easily. Thick as motor oil, one of a kind. 1,072 charactersStonedTrippin, Dec 06, 2014

A: Pours a viscous black with a solid cap of dark brown head that recedes to a persistent collar.  Minimal lacing.
S: Sweet liquid dark chocolate, with medium-dark coffee in the background.  Mild oak and vanilla character provide some complexity and balance.  
T: Dark roasted malt (typical of a bigger RIS), dark and approaching burnt coffee, very mild oak that gets lost in all the bold flavors.  Espresso-like dryness on the finish.  Mild to moderate sweetness.
M: Thick, luscious, and mouthcoating, cut nicely with a light carbonation.  There’s mild heat on this, but the alcohol is barely noticeable.
O: A big, very tasty beer.  This is definitely sweet, but the flavors in this beer are big enough to stand up to the sugar, in contrast to almost all other Avery BA beers except perhaps Rumkin. 829 characterspmarlowe, Dec 05, 2014

Served cold into an Avery stem-tulip in high altitude Fort Collins, CO and allowed to warm over the course of consumption. Side-poured with standard vigor as no carbonation issues are anticipated. 17.81% ABV.
Thanks to Blakelive784 for the share. Expectations are pretty high, but in fairness I wasn't that big Mephistopheles - which I understand is the base.
No bubble show forms as it's poured.
HEAD: One finger wide. Dark khaki colour. Nice creaminess and thickness. Retention is damned impressive considering the ABV - about 3 minutes, not including the retreat to a floater ring. Leaves no lacing as it recedes.
BODY: Opaque dark black - not an ink or jet black, but a dark black. No yeast particulate or hop sediment is visible.
Appears aptly carbonated. Not unique or special appearance, but good for the style certainly.
AROMA: Dark malts, chocolate malts, marshmallow. I pick up on faint coffee when I look for it, but the coffee isn't rich or evocative, and lacks the roastiness and java characteristics I seek in a good coffee stout. The bourbon notes are mild - some mild vanilla but not much oak. Cream.
No yeast character, alcohol, or off-notes are detectable.
Overall, it's a pleasant aroma of average strength. I'd like more of a bourbon-forward profile, with more evocative rich notes of vanilla and coffee. Adding (more) chocolate would be a good call. Sweetness seems perfectly dialed in based on the aroma.
Seems a biteen reticent overall. The notes don't jump out at you; they're rather contained, but in fairness they don't seem muted or subdued. Just mellow - which at ~18% is unexpected.
TASTE: The coffee isn't very rich or evocative; I get some grounds but no real roastiness or fresh java. The base is as you'd expect: plenty of dark malts and chocolate malts, but not too much sweetness. It's not cloying. I pick up on no yeast or off-notes, but judging by the sweetness (or lack thereof) the yeast has an unnaturally high attenuation.
Tame marshmallow. There're hints of bourbon, but they're mild. I get a kiss of vanilla or vanillin, and maybe a bit of charred barrel wood. No rich toasty white oak or genuine vanilla bean. Maybe a brief kiss of coconut?
There's alcohol warmth, but I'd never guess this was 17.81% if I tried it blind.
Is it balanced? I guess...the alcohol - well hidden as it is - is still disruptive, and I just don't feel like the barrel notes accentuate natural characteristics of the base, nor are the barrel notes prominent enough for my tastes. Mephistopheles may be too aggressive a base beer to start with, and the coffee just didn't take. I'd recommend richer more distinctive coffee and a longer barrel aging period. But I could see this mellowing out with age.
It's complex, sure, but compared to the best beers in the style it's not horribly intricate. While it's carefully handled for a 17.81% ABV beer, I wouldn't call it subtle or nuanced.
I do like it, but it never feels like a gestalt whole and there are obvious areas for improvement. The bitterness/sweetness tug-of-war is never resolved, and the barrel isn't well-tailored to the base.
TEXTURE: Creamy, smooth, plump, wet, supple, full-bodied, thick, and chewy.
Should be softer. I love that the ABV is as well hidden as it is, but I also wonder why Avery skews so high on their ABVs in general; this would be more drinkable and approachable at a more reasonable 10-12% ABV. Thankfully, it's not too sticky, syrupy, or viscous.
It does have a harshness to it, an aggression that unsettles. But it's not boozy.
Overall, this texture is a decent companion to the taste, but doesn't elevate the beer and doesn't seem tailored specifically to this flavour profile.
OVERALL: It's got some alcohol warmth, but nowhere near what you'd expect at ~18%. Admittedly, I wasn't huge on the base beer (Mephistopheles), and I don't taste a natural harmony between the bourbon barrel notes and the base. It's surprisingly drinkable for its monstrous ABV, but I think Avery goes big on alcohol to a fault, and gains little in the process. I'd like to see the alcohol dialed back, the bourbon aging period extended, and some nuanced notes added - coconut, milk chocolate, vanilla bean, et al. Worth trying, but not world-class.
Huge thanks to Blakelive784 for the share.

4.75/5  rDev +7.7%While pouring it's consistency is like motor oil but just a tad thinner.  Dark as night with a head that builds into a deep brown.  The head alone takes a while to dissipate back into the beer. 
On the nose I get tons of coffee, sweet molasses and chocolate.  The coffee is very prominent however and it smells like a fresh brewed cup. 
The taste is fantastic.  Sweetness comes first followed by some chocolatey flavors along with coffee at the end.  There are a lot of flavors including chocolate, molasses, coffee, vanilla and oh ya, coffee. 
A nice thick body makes this a delicious beer on a brisk winter day.
I shared this with my brother, but could have easily killed the 12 ounce bottle myself.  Then again I'd be drunk as a skunk.
Overall this is a top notch beer by a top notch brewery.  It's true to what it is with no bells and whistles along the way.  I'll need to buy a few more and see how it develops throughout the winter. Get one!. 953 charactersScaryHairy44, Dec 01, 2014

Given the high ABV and bourbon barrel aging, there is naturally a boozy and wood aroma, along with coffee and roasted malts, some vanilla thanks to bourbon and a touch of cocoa.
Thick, full bodied, chewy, the beer is smooth thanks to the barrels and the high ABV gives off a touch of heat on finish but never turns the beer medicinal or hot.
Balance is kept and it's like drinking a boozy, vanilla coffee (or a vanilla creamer filled java) with touches of chocolate thrown in as well.
Not the most  complex or cheapest beer but pretty good one to try. 633 charactersclayrock81, Nov 30, 2014

4.55/5  rDev +3.2%Review for the BA version --> 4.55 rating
Pours black with a brownish hue and a nice mocha head.  Aroma is definitely sharp and a little stinging from the alcohol. Also get the coffee, lots of thick milk chocolate, and some toasty barrel. The aroma is nice, maybe even very nice, but not great and definitely a step back from the wonderful coffee forward aroma of the original version. Any concerns I might have had towards this from the aroma are shattered with my first sip.  Coffee (though not as much I hoped for), sweet milk chocolate, caramel, toasted oak and some bourbon. Definitely some heat to this but that is unavoidable at 17%, and it is quite drinkable fresh. A full bodied mouthfeel. Overall, great stuff from Avery here. Love that they finally made this beer available in bottles, though I still wish they would have gone with bottling the original non-BA version instead.
Review for the original version, not barrel aged --> 4.75 rating
Finally get to try this monster! 
Pours midnight black with a nice mocha head. This beer is BIG in aroma, flavor and ABV. Huge coffee aroma, lots of chocolate, and some roasted malts. Flavor follows suit, huge coffee hits first, on top the roasted barley, and this leads into a great, rich chocolate finish. An aftertaste of chocolate and some alcohol. A medium to full mouthfeel, not much activity. Overall, worth the hype. A fantastic beer,, such amazing aroma and flavor and so dangerously drinkable. Honestly, I couldn't believe just how smooth and drinkable this beer was at this ABV. Avery needs to bottle this beer not just because its that good but because this is the type of better far better appreciated at home than when out at a bar or their taproom.Give me a bottle of this to sit back with at home, chill out, and just enjoy and I bet my rating for this is even higher. 1,843 charactersdenver10, Nov 30, 2014

Pours a dark, oily black, with a great looking mocha-colored head of about 1.5 inches, which is crazy given the high ABV of this one.
Smells like coffee on steroids, huge sweet and roasty coffee aroma, along with a booze presence that stings the nostrils.
This tastes a bit oily and burning, from the high intensity ABV. It doesn't really detract from the overall flavor though. The coffee flavor here is amplified and really intense- it's hard to pick out nuances in the coffee- it just tastes really sweet, almost vanilla-like, with a slight roasted flavor. There's some chocolate syrup flavors, along with a significant bourbon kick at the end. This shares some similarities with Black Tuesday and it's various cousins- huge, knock-out tastes in an insane ABV package.
This is a little bit light for the ABV, but it's still solid enough, with a very low level of carbonation, and a very creamy mouthfeel.
This is quite the insane beer. For a beer this high in alcohol, it's incredible how they still made it pretty drinkable. 1,090 charactersGreesyFizeek, Nov 28, 2014

Pours an opaque black with a foamy super dark khaki head that fades to nothing. Tiny dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa powder, coffee bean, brewed coffee, and bourbon aromas. Taste is much the same with chocolate syrup, cocoa powder, coffee bean, brewed coffee, vanilla, and bourbon flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roast and wood bitterness and an alcohol kick on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with a fantastic mixture of cocoa, coffee, and bourbon characteristics all around.

Definitely hot with a little burn at this alcohol level, but not off-putting.  It was tough to tell that it had coffee added with how well you could pick up the malt and the bourbon.

Deep chestnut brown out of the bottle, and filling with a classic dark walnut oily black body.  Real nice mocha brown colored head, controlled to a finger, settling with a thin top and fairly bubbled collar.  Not to slick on top, or shiny, pretty solid.
Excellent aroma even just pouring off the bottle.  Hints of warm roast coffee, a hazelnut and dry wood like aroma, with splinter oak qualities also.  Hints of dark brown bread crust, and a real oily bean and nutty quality, almost like macadamia nuts or something.  Very impressive, and not hot at all on the nose either.
Palate is real diverse.  Silky body, with a large huge coating.  Hints of tight tiny carbonation, but with lots of berried fruit.  Huge tobacco notes and roast finish, cigar whiffing and hints of hot smoke.  Very diverse and complex mid palate, warm raspberry, leafy tobacco, oily roast charring and coffee bean.  Oily sense continues but manages some silky quality on the aftertaste, with a big coffee burst, and even almost hop oil finish.
Slickness in a bottle, with a diverse and big palate.  Surprisingly not too out of control, not totally balanced but not out of kilter either.  Very imressive as well and one to take in nice and slow. 1,272 characterssmakawhat, Nov 23, 2014

A very strong nose. Bourbon, chocolate, roasted malt, coffee, in that order.
Oh my, it's tasting superb! The bourbon is very strong but it doesn't over power everything else. The chocolate is sweet, the roasted malt adds the bitterness, and then there's the coffee infusion. Fresh ground like. The 17.81% abv is not hidden very well but in this case, I don't think it needs to be nor can be as this was bottled just a month ago. 
Full bodied with medium carbonation, it is very smooth.

Nice creamy, espresso aromas with hints of chocolate!
The flavors are espresso flavors are more bittering, but not overbearingly bitter. The chocolate presence is velvety, with some molasses notes. Definitely getting some heat in the finish, but doesn't disrupt the flavors.
Not quite as good as BCBCS or Mocha Wednesday (not a good price point either $13) but this is worthy of at least ticking. This is my 2nd favorite from Avery's Barrel Series after 5 Monks. 565 charactersRollzroyce21, Nov 22, 2014

4.36/5  rDev -1.1%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25From the 12 ounce bottle into a snifter. 2014 bottle. 
Straight mocha in a bottle. Pitch black body, still as night with no carbonation visible, and a dark-khaki head, fluffy, creamy and pillow-like. I'd easily rest a bottle cap on this. 5
Sweet, creamy dark roast coffee with a drizzle of caramel, that's this beer. The coffee aroma bursts from this. Slightly solvent, but I'd expect that from a beer this fresh with this much ABV. 4.5
Pretty similar taste to the nose, big coffee flavor of the dark roast variety, sweet caramel, and a slight solvent presence. Coffee lingers on the tongue long after each sip. Tasty, but perhaps almost syrupy, which brings it down a quarter of a point. 4.25
I hint to how it feels with the taste, as this beer has a syrupy quality, but it's also very thick and creamy. There's a spicy hop finish that helps to not make this cloying. Impressively, as this warms, there is almost no heat or solvent feel. 4.25
I find this on par with BCBCS in flavor and feel. It's good and potent. The only difference is this costs twice as much.

A-4.75, S-4.25, M-4.25, T-4.5, O-4.25
The color is like used motor oil -black, thick, opaque look with medium tan head and ultra fine bead wtih lace that sticks, just a very robust intense looking stout. The smell is rich with tons of coffee up front with light raisin and sweet molasses ith a slight alcohol aroma and mild sweet dark cocoa scent. The feel is intense as the look and smell with rich full malt body and very roasted almost char in the dry texture with alcohol warming and lots of residual sugar in the lingering finish. 
 The taste has a wonderful coffee flavor with dark rich malty and dark sugar flavor with subtle raisin and lightly woody toasted sweet flavor with spicy alcohol in the mid palate in the flavor with nutty and almost burnt coffee with hints of spicy pepper and licorice with some intense coffee effects like drying of high alcohol making the flavor increase wtih dark currant and woody flavor which comes out as a spice-like taste with some residual sugar which leaves a slightly bitter flavor lingering. Overall -one of the most intense coffee beers/stouts I have ever tasted 1,180 charactersSlatetank, Sep 14, 2014

Aroma is deep malt, coffee, earthy woodiness and some bourbon. I would swear this is barrel aged. Maybe it is... Taste is that great malt up front, coffee and tobacco at the end with a aged hop flavor in the middle. Great thick mouthfeel, chewy almost. Low carbonation. Great coffee stout, but I feel like the coffee was a bit too much of the focus. 454 charactersmverity, May 25, 2014

4.64/5  rDev +5.2%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75The beer pours a creamy and kind of foamy brown head that dissipates quickly. The beer itself is a dark and opaque black. The beer has a nice sheen that looks a slick.
The beer smell is pretty good. The beer has notes of oak and slight hints of vanilla. The American oak blends particularly with the coffee notes as well light hints of sweet dark chocolate that is probably from the malts. The smell also has a roasted and rough barley smell that goes through the beer.
The beer taste is a bit different from the smell but contains the same notes in addition to new ones. The new notes include a slight hop bitterness that is a pretty good balance to the roasted notes of the malt and barley and coffee. There is also now strong notes of vanilla and alcohol running through the taste and give it a little strength. The beer continues to have a chocolate taste that is from the dark roasted malts. The aftertaste has a pretty strong barley taste with a slight alcohol note and hop bitterness.
The mouthfeel is heavy bodied with some carbonation. The overall feel is pretty smooth and the carbonation adds a nice bite to it that gives it a little texture. OVerall, pretty good.
Overall, a fantastically strong beer that is pretty complex. The beer is easy enough to drink and distinguish the different notes. 1,310 charactersHattedClassic, May 11, 2014

I really dislike Mephistopholes but this is excellent. Black as black can be, decent little tan head. Aroma is really beautiful coffee, all coffee and I have no complaints. Flavor is more rich delicious coffee, not at all bitter and oddly hardly any heat from such a high ABV. This is a very close second to Bourbon County Coffee but lacks the chocolate and vanilla. When this comes out of a bourbon barrel it is really going to be special. 576 charactersArrogantB, Apr 18, 2014

S-A brutish aroma. Hulking amounts of coffee. Heavy sweetness that brings forth lots of chocolate. Hints of dark fruit. Noticeable heat...it's frigging 16%.
T-Espresso and coffee of course. Yet, I find the gigantic sweetness to be even more powerful than the java. Supremely rich in its chocolatey sweetness. Dried fruits lead into a cheek warming dose of heat.
M-Huge and chewy. Oily and sticky. Hot. The body clings to the tongue. Long finish. Gigantic feel.
O/D-A gargantuan stout. Very excited to try this. I was more impressed with its intensity than I am with its overall flavor. This was really neat.

Appearance - black as can be; brown/mocha head. Good head retention, but lacing isn't as strong (likely due to the vessel).
Smell - strong espresso, dark chocolate, oak, vanilla. Powerful and delicious aroma!
Taste - follows the nose with the espresso being the most noticeable characteristic.
Feel - unreal! Heavy, which is to be expected, but the espresso hides the ABV incredibly well!
Overall - incredible beer, but very pricey...definitely worth the try! 493 charactersDenverHopHead, Mar 04, 2014

Tweak is basically black in color with very little creama colored head.
Aroma is rich and roasty with bold coffee notes and a more subtle booziness.
Flavor is as intense as I expected given the strength of the beer. It has a pleasant sweetness up front but turns to fresh iced coffee and roasted dark malts.
Mouthfeel is full bodied and nicely carbonated. The alcohol is pretty well controlled but you definitely notice it after a few small sips. 
Overall an amazing imperial stout and one of the best coffee stouts I've had. It was served too cold but would probably be even better given the chance to warm. 694 charactersGilGarp, Feb 24, 2014
4.62/5  rDev +4.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75On tap into a snifter at the brewery.
A-The beer arrives with only a thin collar of foam, which is not surprising given the ABV. It is nearly black and opaque. There is an oily sheen on the surface and it leaves "legs" of alcohol on the glass as I drink, but no lacing. Nothing awe-inspiring, but it looks like a high-ABV coffee stout.
S-The aroma is very heavy on the coffee. Unlike most beers of this ilk, however, this one lacks the espresso-like (or coffee ground like) bitterness and instead smells just like a delicious cup of drip coffee. Very smooth. The alcohol is warming, but not quite hot. Underlying roasted flavors are also smooth and mild for a beer this big. There is some dark chocolate, as well.
T-The taste is all dark roast coffee...again, its not bitter espresso roast, but smooth drip coffee and it simply amazing. There is some dark berry fruit, chocolate, vanilla, caramel, lightly smokey flavors, as well as a warming booze. I do not taste the 16% ABV; this thing is just so smooth. 
M-The feel is medium to full body with lower than average carbonation. It is heavy, however, and the feeling contributes to the smoothness.
O-This is another great beer from Avery. I just cannot get over how rich the coffee flavor is without any of the bitter coffee-ground flavor that big, boozy, coffee stouts often impart. The feel is also close to perfect for the flavor profile. If this beer has a shortcoming, it is the smell, which is a bit simple and not quite up to the taste. 1,499 charactersspoony, Feb 24, 2014

Pours a pitch black body, head is chocolate colored and 1/4 inch thick. Head lasted for awhile but sadly faded after awhile, lacing was above average. 
Smell is big on roasted and burnt malts. freshly brewed espresso also comes through. Chocolate, sweet vanilla, and bourbon are in the mix too. No hops present, the aromas or strongly whisky and coffee.
Taste is similar to smell, lots of bourbon and bitter coffee. Sweet fudge counteracts the booze, but theres a slight alcohol burn in aftertaste.
Mouthfeel is thick, syrupy, and well carbonated. Head contributed a nice foam momentarily but unfortunately it didn't stay. Whiskey coats the mouth, actually stings a bit but kinda like it. 
Overall this beer is definitely one of a kind. Pushes the boundaries of a beer regarding abv and mouthfeel. Best way I can describe it is the coffee stout version of Utopias. Really enjoyed the beer but alcohol needs to be pulled back a tiny bit to push it to legendary status. 1,003 charactersangelmonster, Feb 04, 2014

Pours black as night with dark brown head, looks like melted chocolate.
Smeels like a strong espresso, chocolate, coffee, toffee, caramel, so much going on.
Tastes amazing, strong coffee, espresso, toffee caramel from the nose, just a bit hot but hides it so well.
Nice creamy thick mouthfeel, as good as it gets.
Overall, this is as close to perfect as it gets. Fbs, bcbcs, kbs, bomb, none of them come close. Hands down my favorite coffee stout so far, blows them all away!

4.85/5  rDev +10%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.75On tap at the Uncle Jacob's Stout release party yesterday. This is my first BA review :)
Serving style was a small 5oz snifter. Immediately when it's set in front of you, you get a blast of espresso, and from multiple feet away. It completely fills the area in which you sit. Appearance wise, I let my pour sit for a good 45 minutes while I enjoyed a 2013 Rumpkin, and the head never dissipated which is incredible for a 15.1% abv brew. The base of this beer is essentially Mephistopheles with pounds upon pounds of coffee beans added throughout the entire brewing process. The smell is incredible, like a freshly french pressed shot of espresso and the appearance might even fool you into thinking it is. The taste matches the nose perfectly with a huge dose of mouth puckering espresso, tons of roast, and a peppery well masked burn from the booze. I think that if you were to tell somebody that this wasn't beer, they would buy it, since the burn could almost pass as the acidic quality found in actual coffee. I love this beer and I hope some day they are able to bottle it.
It is also worth noting that hours later, my mouth still tasted like tweak (even after all of the other beers) so if you plan on doing a tasting, save tweak as your last as to not spoil the other brews. 1,283 charactersdenverbeerguy, Jul 09, 2013

HUGE roasted coffee on the tongue, it dominates the entire taste. A robust and rich blend of coffee it becomes overwhelming at the end.

Fresh roasted coffee bean fruitiness, espresso, dark chocolate, and cocoa give the atoms a very mocha tone. Rich roast malt complements toasty oak well. Booze is fairly subtle.
Deep coffee notes and slightly charred malt are at the forefront, along with a boozy vanilla sweetness. There's an underlying fruit character that emerges as it warms. Definitely coffee dominant initially. Considering the abv, alcohol flavor is fairly well masked, initially. Nutty notes emerge as it warms, with more chocolate coming forth, as well. Becomes smoky and fairly oaky and boozy late, with the booze becoming somewhat overwhelming.
Body is smooth, luscious, and full, with a modest amount if carbonation and significant alcohol warmth that hits deep.
Delicious brew, full of flavor. Coffee is definitely the star, which is a negative for me regarding my preferences for imperial stout flavors. I prefer chocolate. The alcohol becomes overwhelming. 1,044 charactersbarczar, May 31, 2013

Served alongside Avery Mephistopheles.
The beer is black with a quarter inch of oily, dark beige head. The aroma offers a potent dose of rich coffee, followed by light booze, roast, espresso, malt, chocolate. What a bold flavor! Rich and intense with a grand coffee presence. Alcohol warmth in the finish, but not nearly the heat I was expecting and even fearing from a beer of this stature. Full bodied with moderately low carbonation. A delightful brew to sip and savor. I'm so glad I finally came across this one. Delicious. 559 charactersHuhzubendah, Mar 30, 2013

The flavor was of sweet malt, dark chocolate, coffee, roasted malt, wood, and sweet alcohol. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty good brew. When I saw this one pop up on this list available at the festival I was rather excited to say the least. For the ABV level of this one I was really expecting this one to be an absolute booze-bomb.

Pours a standard pitch black, opaque and a thin tan head. Intense roast espresso nose, light bitter chocolate and intense alcohol. Very smooth, creamy and chewy body, minimal carbonation and surprise surprise, a potent wallop of warming booze. Coffee is a little less intense in the nose with molasses and dark fruit adding some sweetness, but this is still an intense coffee bomb with a ton of booze. Easier to drink than expected (or than I probably described), but this was a chore and I'll pass on revisiting. 573 charactersyourefragile, May 23, 2012

Pitch black and thick, it began with a pretty large uniform white that almost looked like it came from nitro. However the massive head faded into a sheen pretty quickly. It never dissipated, though, and for a beer this massive I was surprised it stayed at all.
The nose is an even mix of a nice espresso and rich molasses-heavy imperial stout. Acidity and roasty notes coming from both angles, with just the right mix of beer to coffee.
The flavor continues that theme. Espresso on the front. Roasty, rich, and full bodied. However the middle opens up and the molasses, dark chocolate, and dried fruit character from the stout start to come out more. A nice touch is that while these other notes aren't always there, nothing ever seems to truly come and go completely. Different flavors just become slightly stronger and weaker. This is a nearly perfect blend of espresso and beer and is head and shoulders above any other examples I've had.
You'll no doubt have to sip something this strong, but make no mistake about it - you'll probably feel like you could drink it much faster. It's very quaffable to the point that your ability to function (and the cost of it - it's never cheap) are the real limiting factors.
I've encountered this beer a few times over the last year and I hope it becomes more and more common. It's truly amazing and it might be Avery's best overall beer, and maybe the best coffee beer on the planet.
I can't recommend this enough!
Note: Apparently this will be re-named "Tweak" in the very near future. 1,623 charactersDomingo, Apr 08, 2012

4.92/5  rDev +11.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5On tap at Vine Street for Stout Month 2012. Re-post from my review of "Coffeestopheles" which is what Mountain Sun referred to the beer as, which is irritating because they specifially told me they were two different beers, turns out they just didn't like the name "Meph Addict"? Weak...Anyhow onto the review: They only allow a 4oz pour, arrived in a tiny wine glass that reminded me of a cordial offering. The beer is black, deep black, deep dark brown edges in light but this thing is dark. A decent dark brown head with good retention and excellent lacing. Looks impressive. The nose is rich in character with a ton going on: roasted malts, coffee, chocolate, oak, vanilla, and a hint of nuts. Hides the higher abv well. Perhaps a slight heat detectable but not much at all. Flavor explosion on the palette....wow. Big coffee tones begin as the rich flavors found in the nose come through. the chocolate and oak flavors provide an extremely well balanced beer. Mildly bitter. Hints of nut and raisin. I would never guess this was such a strong beer. Finishes clean and crisp and delicious. I've never had a coffee stout this good before. Amazing. Full bodied and reasonably carbonated. Overall, this beer is phenomenal. I really want another. Extremely highly recommended. 1,276 charactershopfacebrew, Mar 23, 2012
4.55/5  rDev +3.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Draft pour into an 8oz slender tulip for $8. Th7is year's version is listed at 15.5% ABV (slightly less than the base Mephistopheles at 16.83%). Sampled 12/16/11.
A: Dispensed with 2 or 3 fingers of head which was pushed out with more beer as the bartender poured. Served to me with a solid finger of foamy (yet creamy) medium dark brown head. Great retention and already coating the glass as it recedes. Pitch black as expected. Lacing continues in nearly complete sheets.
S: The nose is intensely dark with bitter, heavily roasted coffee. Chocolate covered cherry aromas come through in the second wave. Deeper inhales bring about aromas of rum-soaked dark fruit and rendered caramel.
T: Pure espresso. Alcohol is warming if not hot. Some of the nuance in the nose is lost on the palate but the intensity of the coffee flavor does not disappoint. Bitterness from the combination of espresso and hops adequately offsets the sweetness. Slightly acrid. For its octane, the ABV is masterfully concealed.
M: Full body and chewy texture with a long lingering finish. Ample carbonation provides a pleasant bite that doesn't overwhelm the rich texture of the brew. Intense bitterness on the backend aids in the dry sensation, creating a lasting acrid impression. An appropriate level of attenuation keeps the finish relatively clean. Nowhere near cloying. Absolutely fantastic.
O: Avery KILLED this one. Most coffee forward beer to date. 1,436 charactersFeDUBBELFIST, Mar 10, 2012

This may be one of the very best beers I have ever had. Poured a dark midnight black with a nice cocoa head that receded slowly, leaving magnificent lacing. Had an aroma of high quality coffee/espresso, caramel, milk chocolate and a bit of booze. Tasted of luscious chocolate soaked in espresso with notes of vanilla and caramel. The booze was almost nowhere to be found other than in warming...almost no taste of it on my palate. I am giving full points for taste, because I seriously could not imagine this being any better. Amazingly, outstandingly smooth for a 16.03% ABV brew. So well-balanced, it's almost criminal...namely, because I will likely not find this one again any time soon :(
Mouthfeel is silky smooth, full, a little chewy and warming. Like dessert in a glass...I ordered two of these and ended up kicking the keg. Probably a good thing it kicked because I would have ordered more and at the high ABV, this wonderful brew is a bit dangerous! Highly recommended. 1,065 charactersMsRif, Dec 23, 2011

Called "Mephaddict" at the time.
Poured into a little baby 5.5oz snifter, impenetrable dark brown-black with a thin layer of tan head that receded quite a bit, leaving some lacing on the glass. Aroma was coffee-forward, earthy, dark chocolate, roasty malts, and a bit woody. Taste of roasted coffee, smooth, dry; cocoa and dark chocolate make a serious appearance too, lending to a little bitterness, maybe a little oatmeal in this? Alcohol warmth was felt more than tasted. Full-bodied, intensely roasty; it had a little edge to it: something tells me this beer would benefit from some aging. Good selection though, and nicely drinkable. 686 charactersRifugium, Dec 22, 2011

Appears jet black, thin tan head that leaves great lacing. Smells like a cup of espresso. Monster coffee bean aroma. Taste is pretty much as expected, all coffee. roasty, but not overly bitter. 
Seems thinner than the base beer, and has low carbonation.

Glad to see it as I missed out on it at EBF last year. 4 oz. pour in a snifter, brewed on 12/14/10 according to the menu.
a - Pours a dark brown, almost black color, with one inch of very dark tan head and light carbonation evident. Looks as expected, like a thick ass dark stout.
s - Smells of coffee, roasted malts, alcohol, sweet chocolate, sweet fruit, and bitter chocolate. As expected, lots of coffee, but not as much alcohol as I was expecting. Don't get me wrong it is there, but for over 16% ABV it isn't bad, and some nice sweet chocolate and fruits come through as well. Pretty complex and really nice here.
t - Tastes of coffee, alcohol, roasted malts, bitter chocolate, sweet chocolate, light wood or smoke as well. Again, coffee dominates up front, but alcohol is a little more prominent here than in the nose. Not as much sweetness as well, so a step down from the nose for me. Again, not nearly as much alcohol as I expected.
m - Medium to full body and low carbonation, smooth and thick. Some alcohol warmth.
o - Overall I thought this was a very good stout, and a huge improvement over Mephistopheles'. I've had Mephistopheles' fresh and wasn't a big fan of it, and got to try a version on tap tonight that was 1 or 2 years old, and this was much better than both. Would really like to have it again sometime. 1,434 charactersmdfb79, Dec 06, 2011

A: Dark pour with a huge brown head. Lacing and retention are well above average. 4.5
S: Wow is this a beer of a cup of coffee? Chocolate, and a lack of booze, mixes with the coffee to make a phenomenal smell. Really amazed how little alcohol I get on this. 4.5
T: Returns to the Mephistopheles taste I've become used to. Boozy and chocolatey, but this has coffee on steroids. I love the boost of roastiness this gets. Being a year old probably helps the beer as the chocolate and booze have become more mellowed, allowing the coffee to come to the forefront. 4.5

Mephaddict pours a standard stout black, totally impenetrable by light. The wispy tan foam that crowns the beer is barely there, and definitely not enough of a base off of which to make any judgements about head retention or lacing. The nose is a one note coffee bomb. The almost espresso-like aroma is great, but the novelty wears off quickly with nothing else behind it. I hope there's more to this beer, as I'm not a huge fan of anything that drinks like straight cold coffee. Thankfully, in addition to the expected heavy handed coffee flavor, a nice robust dark chocolate note fills out the profile. I still would have preferred the base beer to come through a bit more relative to the coffee, but the balance here is certainly serviceable. The body is full, but not as viscous as I might have guessed given the ABV. The carbonation is just a little too bubbly though, to the point where it distracts from all the malty goodness on occasion. Mephaddict is one of the better cofee infused stouts I've had in a while. 1,091 charactersaxeman9182, Dec 06, 2011

Avery went all out on this one. Scramjet black, thin lacing around the head. 
The coffee and almost chocolately smell overwhelms you, even when the glass is two feet from you.
The taste packs a whallop (along with the insane ABV) of espresso like blackness and it is sublimely smooth.
I could swirl and sip on one of these for hours, the complexity they baked into it is amazing. 
I really hope they bottle this one someday, it is truly exceptional. 534 charactersAdamostella, Nov 14, 2011

Review taken from notes
This beer pours motor oil black in color. It has a finger of dark tan head on it. The head sticks around for a bit and it leaves some scattered lace stuck to the glass. The nose has a huge coffee aroma that comes through as the dominate smell. There is also a nice roasted malt presence, as well as some fruitiness. The taste follows the nose quite well. There is a lot of coffee flavor that really stands out. The roasted malt and dark fruit flavors are also present. There is a bit of booziness here as well, which is to expected. The finish leaves some lingering coffee and roasted malt bitterness on the palate. This has a full body and good carbonation. It goes down easy and has a chewy quality to it. There is some roasted bitterness and some sweetness. There is some alcohol warmth as well. This has great drinkability. It is a slow sipper, but the flavor is outstanding. I really love this beer. It is excellent, and I definitely recommend picking up a glass of this if you come across it. Excellent beer. 1,086 charactersJizackFH, Nov 07, 2011

Pours pitch black and complete opaque with faint mahogany edges and a one finger frothy mocha head.  Good retention slowly fading into to lasting ring.  Spotty chocolate colored lacing left behind.  
Roasted coffee and dark malt aroma with lots of roasty espresso and toast but not burnt smelling.  Hints of sweet chocolate, nut, oatmeal and subtle booze.  Smells like really roasted chocolate coffee.  
Chewy viscous body with a blast of smooth roasted coffee up front that lingers over the roasted malt notes into a lingering dry finish.  Smooth coffee flavor that is roasted wihout being acrid or burnt.  Countered by hints of toast, dark choc, oatmeal and nuttiness.  Subtle lactic creaminess with faint sweet booziness in the finish.  Abv very well masked with little heat in the back end and faint warmth in the finish. 858 characterscorby112, Jun 28, 2011
4.26/5  rDev -3.4%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5It was meant to be on tap at The Good Life, but by the time I showed up it was already kicked! Now that's a release party. Luckily one of the owners (Pete) had an extra growler and hooked me up. Love that guy.
The look is exactly what an Imperial Stout should be. It's nearly opaque black with a wonderfully chocolate colored head and lace. The smell is a bit over the top with the alcohol for me, but other notes like vanilla, bourbon, coffee, and even a bit of chocolate are there. I'd have to say the same about the flavor, the alcohol is completely unmasked and is quite dominant, but the coffee does a great job of balancing the bourbon notes. Chocolate comes into play a little more as well. I only noticed it in the nose after tasting it. Absolutely smooth and quite viscous. Overall a very solid beer, but a bit high in the ABV. 837 charactersryantaussig, Jun 25, 2011

A-black as night with a nice chocolate milk head about a finger high. Lots of carbonation the head is not strong 5 min later but it hasn't gone away either. 
S-the coffee is over powering any other smells I would be picking up, by just the smell I doubt most people would believe it's beer. 
T- slight, slight chocolate but the obvious coffee bomb is right there. Good roasted burnt coffee with helping hands from the malt. 
M- this beast is very lively, it doesn't dance withcarbonarionnin your mouth it throws a mosh pit. Slight burn at the end that quickly gets masked by the coffee. 
O/d- this one is worth the hype, love it, I would suggest this to anyone that can get a glass, savior every last drop. Drinkability is amazingly easy the little burn you feel at the end could be from the high coffee in it and might not be the 16% abv. I could see this one getting a lot of people in trouble from not noticing you just crushed a glass while having lite conversation.

4.59/5  rDev +4.1%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Upon one draw of aroma and a supple sip, it's hard not to sum up a quality reveiw without including a phrase like "stupid-crazy" or "ya gotta be kiddin' here". With copious amounts of espresso and added conditioning, the Mephistopholes Stout just got better!
Strong and smooth, the espresso notes wrap this stout in a cacoon of silky smoothiness that delivers the beer in an inky-black hue that coats the glass like port. A light creamy head adorns the rim in even an espresso-like manner. Low on retention or lace, the 16% abv just wont allow it- instead, brandy-like legging and oily weight sculpts the impressions.
A burst of espresso leaps out of the glass and without any of the burnt or coffee ground aromas that often accompany coffee beers. Smooth roast, walnuts, caramelized molassas, malted bitter chocolate candies all round together in a seductive and decedant nose.
All the flavors of espresso, tampered roast, nutty/malty taste, bitter-sweet chocolates all give the distinct impressions of chocolate coated espresso beans that you buy at classic coffee shops. Oxidized esters contribute flavors of burnt currants, black cherries, red grapes, and savory sherrys and even a hint of soy sauce for added complexity and depth.
With extreme alcohols, the beer hardly attempts to build any creaminess from carbonation. Rather it allows the velvety weight of the beer to provide a lush and silky feel while allowing the full oily textures to coat and penetrate the surfaces of the mouth for fullness and richness in flavor. Obviously the beer finishes malt-rich, warming, and with a long linger of coffee. 
Impressively, the beer avoids any acrid or astringent roast from either the dark grains or coffee. Secondly, the harsher alcohols of 16% are surpressed underneath the coffee and go largely unnoticed. A beautiful beer all around. 1,846 charactersBEERchitect, May 26, 2011
4.75/5  rDev +7.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5The greatest joy with a beer is having a “wow” moment. This beer is a true “wow” in every sense of the expression. 
Poured into a 6 oz snifter to the top, I can’t comment much on lacing or body, but foam was there around a deep viscous black beer. A bit of brandy legs as well.
The aromas were dark bitter espresso, dark chocolate, milk chocolate, the deepest roasted coffee, with a myriad of dark sweet candy like notes.
One of the most overtly espresso flavored beers I can recall. The espresso bitterness is balanced wonderfully by chocolate flavors, deep sweet roasted malt, and perhaps a touch of age. The sweetness on this one would generally lead to an awful experience, but the bitter espresso beans are so over powering that the end result is nearly balanced to perfection though I’m always ok with a bit more bitterness in my beers.
At 16% you expect the body to be viscous, creamy, and amazingly thick. You also expect alcohol to be over powering at times. That said this beer masks the alcohol better than any beer I can think of off the top of my head. It certainly warms the face and never do you forget there’s plenty of alcohol here, but it is amazingly well hidden.
One of the best stouts I’ve had and for the coffee lovers it simply is to die for. Thank you to the guys at the Beer Trappe for having this one. I can’t express enough how much I liked it. 1,394 charactersbobhits, May 26, 2011
4.47/5  rDev +1.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4After trying this at DLD 2010, I scheduled my Friday evening around the tapping of a sixth barrel of this gem at The Long Room. Served in a snifter - I was initially shocked by the $10 sticker price, but then realized it had the same amount of alcohol as two 7.5% beers. This batch clocked in at 15.1%. Kicked in about 3.5 hours more or less.
A - Served with a finger of tan foam that settles to a thin cap, leaving glass-coating lace. Body is straight-up black, although it was hard to be 100% certain in the low light conditions.
S - Big earthy intense coffee leaps out of the glass, following by peripheral notes of dark fruits, dark chocolate, anise, roasted malts, and a hint of booze. Really fantastic - a beer I'd happily nurse all night just to keep drawing in deep breaths of this fine aroma.
T - The taste has less overt coffee, and more sweetness to it. There's still plenty of dark chocolate, but more rum-soaked fruits and burnt sugars tip the scales a bit. The espresso pops back up in the finish, providing lingering roasty bitterness. Alcohol is minimally present in the taste.
M - There's some definite alcohol warmth here - my face started tingling after nary a few ounces and I started to feel flush. Sticky, viscous, chewy and clingy full body with lower carbonation otherwise.
D - Definitely a one and done kind of beer. I ordered two glasses as I was worried it would kick before Sean arrived and the bartender gave me an incredulous look. I also was forced to text Sean telling him that if he didn't show up to drink his glass he could find me passed out on Irving Park the following morning. Great nightcap beer though, and a great start to Chicago Craft Beer Week (even if the Avery event wasn't officially part of it). 1,749 charactersMasterSki, May 21, 2011

3.19/5  rDev -27.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 3 | taste: 3 | feel: 3 |  overall: 3.5Falling Rock was pouring this one tonight. What a pour! Black and luscious, creamy head and soft. Nice. Reddish hints on the rim. Oooh-la-la...
Coffee. Black rich coffee in the nose. That's it. 
Coffee again in the taste. This time, though, it's accompanied by black plum and a bit of roasted malt. Not much else to describe this one. It rivals KBS and is a bit thicker on the palate.  Coffee. Coffee. The scourge of coffee
Easy drinking for a 16% whopper. Dangerous. 470 charactersMebuzzard, Apr 09, 2011
4.62/5  rDev +4.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Another one I was really looking forward to trying, especially after enjoying the Out of Sight a month or so ago. This did not let down. Deep rich black color, minimal head. Huge nose of French pressed coffee, and as it warms, booze. On the palate, coffee is prevalent, and dominates, but in a very good way. Alcohol is so well hidden, its ridiculous. Another outstanding beer on an outstanding beer drinking day. 413 charactersemmasdad, Sep 19, 2010
5/5  rDev +13.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I had this at Stone's 14th Anniversary Celebration 8/21/10. A big pour into a taster glass.
A-Wow that's dark! Very dark head of tight bubbles that receeds quickly. 
S-It screams coffee, but in a good way. I love good coffee and wish I could get more of this.
T-Coffee! big surprise there. Not harsh though light and flavorful a little alcohol but you'd never think it was 16%. 
M-Luscious! Some stout's have a harshness to them that's off putting but this does not. It's smooth, definitely full bodied but well carbonated so it goes down easy.
D-I thought this was the regular Mephistopheles so I only got 1 taster thinking I could get more bottles. I should have sipped on a few more of these it was REALLY good! 719 charactersZX6Chris, Aug 26, 2010
4.32/5  rDev -2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4~3 oz. pour tried at the Avery dinner, 24 Diner, Austin, 29 Jul 2010.
Served in a white wine glass. Small dark brown head. Opaque chocolate brown color. Light carbonation. Aromas of espresso, dark chocolate, lots of roastiness, ethanol. Flavor is dominated by the espresso. Also plenty of chocolate and cocoa, vanilla. Ethanol is upfront and in your face but not hot. Mouthfeel is like melted dark chocolate, thick. Finish is roasty bitter.
Excellent replacement for coffee or espresso at the end of a meal. 509 charactershtomsirveaux, Jul 31, 2010
4.57/5  rDev +3.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Draft at Varga Bar during Philly Beer Week 2010.
Pours black as night with some big dark mocha fluffy head.
Aroma was easily the best coffee aroma I have ever gotten out of a beer. This was on par with roasting fresh coffee beans at home. Tucked behind this were some hints of chocolate and vanilla, but man, that coffee nose was beautiful.
Big super sweet malty bomb, but balanced incredibly well with a rich bitter roasted finish. 
I'm not sure how long this was aged, but typically I find fresh batches of Mephistopheles to be a bit boozy and hot on the throat, but Meph Addict had none of that! This was incredibly smooth and I can't believe it's the same 16% beer. Super thick mouthfeel and incredibly viscous, but it leaves a great dark chocolate mocha finish on the tongue.
Overall, this was far too drinkable for what it is. I could've put away the 8 oz. pour in seconds and it took restraint to sip it. Easily the best Avery brew I've had to date and one of the highlights to PBW2010. 998 charactersChrisPro, Jun 29, 2010
4.25/5  rDev -3.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Draft brewvival. Okay I want to first start of by saying that I strongly dislike the standard version of Mephistopheles. I think its a hot cloying mess. With that being said some people really eat up the under-attenuated stouts, its just not my thing. So onto meph-addict.. Thick viscous dark pour with a thin tan head . Nose is punch you in the face coffee. Flavor is much of the same. The coffee really improved a mediocre base beer. Alcohol well masked 455 charactersucusty, May 29, 2010
4.47/5  rDev +1.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5GLASS: Snifter
TEMP: Served at approx 40 degrees, allowed to warm about 10 degrees before drinking
I was lucky enough to try this one at DLD 2010.
Pours a very nice black color with some dark crimson highlights. A creamy, light brown colored head forms on top, then recedes rather quickly, leaving a small surface ring of bubbles. Lacing is very minimal, and slides down the oily sides of the glass.
The nose is filled with very rich notes of roasted malts. It has an almost fudge/brownie like chocolatey-ness to it. Beautiful notes of espresso. Hints of molasses and dark fruits.
The flavor follows the nose. There are nice notes of molasses that come forward. The espresso notes seem to be blended with sweetened condensed milk. The balance of roasty to sweet to almost burnt/bitter plays off of each other component very well.
Beautiful, full body. Mild level of carbonation. Extremely smooth, but sadly lacks any real depth of creaminess. Silky for sure, but could easily be velvet-like with a bit of tweaking.
I'm not sure if the 16.03%abv is correct or not, but if it is then this brew is criminal. It certainly drinks a whole lot easier than that. It does have a certain touch of booziness to it, but I think that the high presence of espresso/coffee flavor gives it a lot of balance, or at least helps mask it well. 1,328 characterscoldmeat23, May 26, 2010
4.3/5  rDev -2.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5I had this on tap as a guest beer at FFF on DLD.
A-Dark brown with no head and minimal lacing, probably due to the tap pour.
S-Rich roasted malts and coffee with chocolate and dark fruit aromas.
T-Syrupy with cocoa and dark fruit flavors and a nice blend of coffee and liquor that was not overstated. Very pleasant.
M-Creamy, but not necessarily thick with low carbonation and overall nice feel.
D-I didn't know what to expect, but I was pleasantly surprised at this beer's complexity. Avery has done a nice job with this one. 526 charactersbierenutz, May 02, 2010
4.6/5  rDev +4.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4OMG- What an incredible beer. They really need to make this full time. Mesatopholes with coffee in it. Aroma was of rich roasted coffee. Color was jet black with no head. Flavor was of an espresso coffee with quite a warm alcohol kick. Mouthfeel was full bodied. I loved this beer and the caffiene in it definetly got me buzzed. 328 charactersbigbelcher, Apr 16, 2010
3.78/5  rDev -14.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.5I could almost start and end my review with a single word: Kahlua.
Dark brown color with a short head with dissipates quickly. Most of my time with this beer, it had neither cap nor foam. Nose is full of chocolate and espresso. Highly roasted, but also a sweet presence. Alcohol is all over this one. 
The flavor is very boozy. Switches from chocolate to coffee as the dominant flavor, with plenty of good stuff like molasses and dark fruit. Full, thick mouthfeel, and a velvety soft finish. 
There's a lot to be said about this one, but to my taste buds it was way too sweet - almost like hot chocolate - and the booze was far too apparent. This was a shot at a gold medal in abv and that's about it. Dial this one back and you've probably got a damn fine ale, but as it stands I can't recommend this. 805 charactersBretSikkink, Apr 16, 2010
4.47/5  rDev +1.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5On-tap at Brewvival.
Pours black with a small brown head. The head quickly recedes into a thin ring around the glass leaving light lacing.
Smells of loads and loads of espresso coffee. Serving as the backbone are good amounts of molasses, roasted malts, and unsweetened chocolate, in that order.
Tastes similar to how it smells, although the coffee influence isn't quite as large. Smooth coffee flavors kick things off with roasted malts lurking in the background. Midway through the sip molasses flavors join in and sweeten things up a bit. Coffee and chocolate flavors with a decidedly sweet edge then carry through to an ending that's neither sweet nor bitter.
Mouthfeel is very good. It's got a smooth thickness with soft carbonation.
Drinkability is also very good. I didn't have a problem finishing my glass and could have a few more, even at such a big ABV.
Overall I enjoyed this one more with coffee than without as it cut some of the sweetness. Well worth a shot. 979 charactersglid02, Mar 01, 2010
4.53/5  rDev +2.7%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a dark oily black with tints of mahogany. Silky tan head has nice lace for a beer of this size.
Nose has sweet espresso, chocolate fudge, nutty malts, molasses, ripe pitted fruits, anise and vanilla.
Taste has dark cocoa, coffee, rum, cherries, plums, bitter hops and molasses.
Thick body is delicately carbonated. Nice finish. Quite tasty, coffee really helps mask the booze. 391 charactersrye726, Feb 18, 2010
