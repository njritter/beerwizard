4.73/5  rDev +6.3%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75This beer is an extremely thick pouring beer. It pours very dark. The head was minimal, but a nice shade of tan. There's a ring of carbonation bubbles on the side of the glass, that looks quite cool as the pop, and reform. 
The nose of this beer is chocolate. I also get a hint of cinnamon. I do not get the peppers they put into the beer.
 The taste of this beer is very well balanced between the chocolate, cinnamon, and on the back end, peppers. All 3 really work to give an amazing taste to this beer. 
Feel is quite thick and sticky going down. it really coats the throat all the way down with it's goodness. 
Overall, AMAZING! Damn! I wish I had more. I'm going to be savoring this beer all night. 707 charactersVictory_Sabre1973, May 08, 2017

Standard looking stout. Smells mildly chocolatey and spicy. When it comes to taste, this is where they shine: I love how understated their beers are. The flavors are never over the top-there's plenty of cinnamon and chocolate blending with the mild heat of the peppers over a very strong roasty stout base. Perfectly smooth feel. If they had this out year round, I'd be drinking it all the time. 510 charactersmschrei, May 05, 2017

4.37/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Received from @Harrison8 (@THSdrummer) in NBS BIF #5.
750 mL bottled 10/2016.  Stored at 42 degrees.  Served at 58 degrees in a Jester King snifter.
Aroma - primarily chocolate with some faint chilis.
Head – small (Maximum < two cm, aggressive pour), brown, very dense and creamy, good retention.  Slowly diminishing to a four mm creamy ring and a thin layer with a few rocks.
Lacing – none.
Body – dark brown/black, opaque.
Flavor – The initial hit is cacao and some pleasant anchos.  I’m not a fan of putting a piece of the sun in my mouth; anchos are the perfect pepper for me – flavorful with some heat but still edible.  As the beer warms in my mouth, the cinnamon kicks in and the anchos heat up a bit.  There is a little post-swallow pleasant gastric burn.  Behind all the additives, malt can still be detected.  The 10% ABV alcohol isn’t detectable until it joins with the anchos to start a small fire just south of my cardiac sphincter.  No hops, no diacetyl.
Palate – medium to full, creamy, soft carbonation.
I can see why this beer is so highly rated – balance.  There is just enough chili to provide some flavor without burning my taste buds out; thank you for that.  The cinnamon comes in at the tail end and is not the star of the show, just another important player.  The cacao provides a unifying factor, continuity between the aroma, the first taste, and the after taste.  And at the heart of it all, you can tell it’s a stout.

4.67/5  rDev +4.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5This beer pours a deep black with a small but lasting head. The aroma offers up dark chocolate, spice, cinnamon, and a little pepper seed and flesh. The flavor is also chocolate forward, with notes of milk and dark chocolate intermingled, as well as marshmallow, cocoa powder, spicy chili, cinnamon, nutmeg, and plum. The mouthfeel is full, and rich with light foamy carbonation and a sticky finish. Overall this is very balanced given the boldness of the flavors - the spice is neither overwhelming, nor to light. I see why this is a classic. 543 charactersCzequershuus, Apr 21, 2017
4.23/5  rDev -4.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25From a 750 ml bottle (dated November 28, 2016) to a snifter.
A-The beer pours like motor oil out of the bottle; some of the heaviest looking stuff I have ever seen. The medium-brown head falls almost like a Guinness in the glass before settling to fat two-finger height. Retention is good for the style. The liquid beneath is ebony and still.
S-The aroma delivers on the advertised flavors of chile peppers, cinnamon, and cocao. I also pick up notes of chocolatey brownie batter, mocha, wisps of smoke, and hints of creamy vanilla. The aroma is on the sweet side with suggestions of brown sugar and molasses. Nice, but I'm not blow away.
T-The taste is similar to the smell and there is a lot happening here. It is quite sweet with flavors of molasses, cacao, and vague dark fruits, maybe prune? I also pick up the brownie batter and a creamy, sweet vanilla flavor that reminds me of marshmallow. The cinnamon is moderately strong and blends well with the tickle of the spicy chiles. The finish is sticky with notes of black licorice. Alcohol is well concealed.
M-This thing is heavy (almost like a milkshake) with a fair amount of very fine carbonation. The finish is sticky.
M-This is a good beer with a lot happening. I would suggest seeking this out if you like the heavy mouthfeel and lots of well-done adjunct flavors. I would like to drink this side-by-side with a Prairie Bomb sometime...for the sake of research, of course! 1,437 charactersspoony, Apr 21, 2017

Appearance: Pours jet black. Moderate amount of bubbles and a slight finger of tan head that quickly fades away. 
Smell: A spicy and roasty dark malt driven aroma with a scent of chocolate and spices. Dark roasted malt with a scent of dark chocolate, cacao nibs, coffee, toast, biscuit, grains, nuts, toffee, and caramel with yeast.  Big scent of spice with some cinnamon and chili peppers. Sweet scent of vanilla and molasses. Hints of leather, tobacco, and dark fruit. A really good aroma. 
Taste: Like it smells, a spicy and roasty dark malt driven taste with notes of chocolate and spices. Dark roasted barley malt with notes of dark chocolate, cacao nibs, coffee, biscuit, grains, toast, toffee, caramel, and nuts along with yeast. Spice notes of cinnamon and chili peppers. Sweet taste of vanilla bean and molasses. Undertones of dark fruit, leather, and tobacco. A really good taste. 
Mouthfeel: Full bodied with a moderate amount of carbonation. Spicy, rich, and slick. 
Overall: A great spiced Imperial Stout. Really nice mix of roasty and spice flavor. 1,125 charactersMattyG85, Apr 08, 2017

The head creates a really nice looking fuzz that spreads out across the surface and creates a nice blanket with some good weight to it. The beer itself is also very good looking. It has a nice black chocolate syrup note to it with a nice weighty texture.
The smell is very good. It has a nice pepper smell that acts as a great topping to the strong yet not overpowering cinnamon aroma. The cocoa nibs are interestingly moderate and subtle but works well and creates a good powdery sweetness that mixes well with the cinnamon.
The taste is fantastic. It has the same notes as the smell but with a lighter pepper note and a stronger cocoa nib note that makes it a bit more milk chocolate sweet that goes well with the cinnamon.
The feel is pretty good. It has a strong heavy body that feels thick and luxurious with a nice syrupy feel. There is also a slight burn but not enough to turn people off. The carbonation is . . . foamy but it adds a nice and constant texture to the beer.
Overall, this is a fantastic beer and worth the chase. It's a great full bodied beer with great strong notes that really tantalizes the senses. It's an extremely well rounded beer with strong notes and worth getting your hands on if you can. 1,353 charactersHattedClassic, Feb 15, 2017

A: Pours jet black in color with a small, foamy, dark brown to khaki colored head with minimal retention. Thin, khaki colored lacing throughout.
S: Huge aromas of chocolate, cinnamon, vanilla, and chili peppers exactly as advertised. Milder notes of coffee, toffee, and dark fruits.
T: Holy wow. Tasty cinnamon roll in a glass. Starts off with big notes of chocolate and cinnamon followed by vanilla, coffee, caramel, and toffee. Finishes with hints of chili peppers, raisins, and other dark fruits. Mild lingering bitterness on the end.
F: Full bodied. Thick, smooth, and super creamy. Light carbonation.
O: Overall, this is an amazing Imperial Stout. Literally tastes like a liquified cinnamon roll. My first time trying this and I will definitely be revisiting this one. One of my new all time favorites. Worth the hunt for a bottle if you have the opportunity. 914 charactersBeerGuy8315, Feb 04, 2017

4.72/5  rDev +6.1%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.754 ounce pour from the draft, came out pitch black with a half a finger of caramel foamy head. Lacing is great. Aroma is strong, but extremely well balanced. Notes of spices, peppers, cinnamon, vanilla, all sing and dance with roasted malts playing bass. Extremely well balanced and put together. Flavor profile answers the standard set by the aroma, with notes of spices, cocoa, cinnamon, vanilla, peppers, and roasted malts. Note, there is some spiciness to this beer, and yet it refrains from being a heartburn catalyst. Flavor profile is well balanced and smooth. Mouth feel is thick, and creamy. Without a doubt, the feel packs a wallop, delivering all the goodness of the aroma and flavor profile in a thick, but extremely drinkable, feel. There is a bit of grain to the feel as the beer warms. Concluding word in my notes "woah". Despite lots and lots of complexity to this beer, it remains extremely approachable and drinkable. Top notch stout with chilis. 
Served in a 4oz snifter. Draft. 
**This was my first drink of Abraxas. I've been hunting it for a while. I do work hard to squeeze out any bias in my number ratings, but as a local guy, I may be biased. 1,169 charactersHarrison8, Jan 10, 2017

The cinnamon, the chili peppers, the cocoa and the vanilla all seem to dance around my tongue.  A little less vanilla then the rest but enough to mellow and smooth out the flavor.  Thick, milk shake like feel.  Slight stickiness is welcome as it allows for a prolonged taste on the tongue and second tasting on the lips.  This is one of the best non-BA stouts I've ever had.  Would love to try the BA and coffee versions. 517 charactersbnes09, Jan 04, 2017

~1-2 months from bottling date
Appearance- Pours a black color, oily body, opaque. Thin layer of dark brown colored head, fizzy / creamy. Lots of spotty head lacing and thick sticky alcohol legs coat glass.
Aroma- Dry cocoa, fudgy dark chocolates. Sweet creaminess, caramel syrup, vanilla, cinnamon, sweet cinnamon bun with vanilla frosting. Subtle sweet pepper in the background, no heat though.
Taste- Smooth sweetness, sweet chocolate, caramel, cinnamon swirl, vanilla. Fudgy dark chocolates, cocoa, roast, coffee. Peppers add a spiciness and just a touch of balanced heat. Chocolatey sweetness lingers.
Feel- Full bodied, thick and hugely creamy. Lower carbonation, silky smooth.
Overall- Incredible dessert-like qualities with the cinnamon and sweetness. Chocolate is just over the top chewy and fudgy. Peppers add a nice spice, not overly hot. Everything comes together so well, and the creamy mouthfeel enhances the beer. A remarkable beer. 965 charactersOrangeMen, Jan 02, 2017
3.87/5  rDev -13%look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 3.75Poured 750ml bottle into a snifter, bottled 11/2015. Color is obsidian with a paper thin tan head and no lacing. Aroma of weaker coffee, a bit of pepper, cinnamon, nutmeg, dark chocolate, toasted malts, maybe some vanilla. All the aromas are together and pleasant, but not as strong as I would have expected from other reviews. The taste is a very nice roasted malt stout, but lacks coffee flavor. There are notes of cinnamon, nutmeg, dark chocolate, and faint spicy pepper. I thought this would be more spicy, but it is rather mild. The feel is medium, but seems a bit thin for a big stout like this. The carbonation is also somewhat lacking. I found this to be quite good, but I was expecting much more based on the reviews. My fear of a spicy beer when fresh is partly to blame. 781 charactersRi0, Jan 01, 2017

Poured into my favourite Watou chalice, the pour produces a thick oily brew with a decent tan head. Nose is of chocolate malty goodness and spiced chocolate liqueur, yes there is such a decadent thing! The alcohol is present on the nose. The taste is a challenge with this one, I mean don't get me wrong there is plenty going on here, it's just not easy to pick apart each flavour. The chocolatey goodness of the stout is upfront and then the spices come in. Yes I can really taste the cinnamon but it kind of melds with the chillies, it's a fairly homogenous experience if that makes sense... The mouthfeel is thick and slick. Overall a great brew, its different from Hunahpu's as you can really pick out the spices individually in that brew. This one is a little more homogenous but none the less amazing! 935 charactersalpineclimber, Jan 01, 2017

Pours a pitch black with a moderate and attractive looking mocha foam head. The head retained well and left some lacing.
Sweet in the nose; chocolate, cocoa, vanilla, almond and cinammon.
Unbelievably smooth and creamy in the mouth. The carbonation is very soft, gentle and just about perfect. Full in the mouth; a sipper and easy to drink at the same time. The chocolate adds a nice coating of sweetness, while the cinammin adds some dessert like spice. Not cloying at all. Instead, perhaps my favorite aspect of this brew is the chili pepper like spice that is evident in the finish and leaves a fantastic aftertaste that makes me want to go back to it. It is similar to when you have a fantastic meal that lingers in the tastebuds and in the memory. The alcohol is perceptible, but barely. It neither burns or is heavily boozy despite the 10% ABV.

Damn near perfect...  The chilies and cinnamon come through loud and clear and they are delicious...  The heat of the chilies aren't really a flavor, more of a suggestion...  Very subtle...  This is the beer Xocoveza wanted to be...  Some booze here...  I like it quite a bit...love it actually...

3.75/5  rDev -15.7%look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 3.75Deep black pour, used motor oil, midnight black, all those usual descriptors, 1/3" tan head on it, small bubbles.  Aroma heavy on the roast, a mild amount of peppers and cinnamon on top of it, you've had this beer before in other regions, Stone, Cigar City etc. . . 
Taste, good hits with the roast first and foremost, not acrid, not overly sweet, brings the heat pepper wise but with enough two row and black roasted malt to hold its own and not let the spice dominate.  Cinnamon in a decent proportion in the mouth feel.   Really one of those midwest pour kinds of beers, after around 4oz I'm kind of hitting the point of diminishing returns.  A share beer.  
Carbonation well done and subdued to allow for different adjuncts to come out.   Alcohol noticeable, but not soul crushing.   Decent chocolate and cocoa presence.  
A good beer, but plenty of easier, more accessible beers doing the same thing as this one. 920 charactersrodbeermunch, Dec 12, 2016

A - Pours black with a small tan head.
S - Aroma  is not strong but it's mostly cinnamon.
T - Flavor is a wonderfully perfect balance of cinnamon and chocolate with just a touch of pepper flavor and heat on finish.
M - Mouth feel is smooth & creamy, kinda thick, low carbonation.
O - Darn near perfect adjunct stout. 370 charactersspacecake9, Dec 09, 2016

4.49/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Incredible beer.  So much going on, and very cinnamon-heavy, but it comes together so well.  Look is jet black with a foamy toffee head.  Very velvety and smooth.  Smell is big and rich, with strong notes of chocolate, cinnamon, mild char, dark fruit (plum, fig, and raisin), molasses and brown sugar, and lighter notes of chili pepper and espresso.  Flavor is all of the above, with the cinnamon coming to the forefront with the chocolate, but balanced by the dark fruit and slight heat from the peppers.  Coffee and molasses, vanilla and toffee, roasted malt, more sweet than bitter.  The booze is noticeable but pleasant.  Heavy and viscous and warming beer.  Just an incredible sipper on a cold day.  I don't love a lot of cinnamon in beer, but I really like it here. 771 charactersAmeriCanadian, Dec 06, 2016

Nose expresses ethanol, ground coffee, cocoa and cinnamon.  Taste follows nose; however, the cinnamon is much more evident in the flavor profile.  Mouthfeel is light-medium in body, perhaps a bit thin for the style, with an almost still carbonation and some residual heat at the back.  Overall, a solid offering; however, a fuller mouthfeel would enhance this beer. 453 charactersJwale73, Dec 03, 2016

p- black with no head; thin tan ring
n- absolutely massive; spices- cinnamon, nutmeg; underlaying milk choc sweetness; noteworthy
t- follows the nose but on a less bold note; sweet forward- cocoa and vanilla; lots of spices in the fin that pair with roast and linger into the aftertaste; fin is a bit abrasive; med bitterness and light-med alcohol warmth; not bad, but the spicing seems overdone; *spice subsided a bit as I drank; nuttiness came out; became more enjoyable
mf- light-bodied for style; soft-med carb; slick; mf is similar to sump, imo
o- I really regret not drinking this sooner, as I think the experience might have been different (although I'm reading that age actually diminishes the spice); spices seem to overwhelm the finish in this beer; really trying to like it more, but I'm a little disappointed; Bomb and Huna are more likable, imo 894 charactersmuchloveforhops3, Dec 01, 2016

4.42/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.52016 batch. 
Appearance: poured into snifter glass, amazingly deep black for a 10% ABV beer. Half inch bright tan head after pouring that stayed around for a little while. 
Aroma: smelled like Cinnabon rolls. Cinnamon at first with subtle peppers following after. 
Taste: started out sweet with chocolate and cinnamon at first and then the slight heat from the peppers. As the beer warmed up, the peppers became far more noticeable throughout the tasting and the cinnamon was less present. The peppers stuck around at the aftertaste but not overwhelming. I just wished there was more cinnamon present. The heat was not harsh, so it was easy to drink. 
Mouthfeel: very thick and rich. Impressive for an imperial stout at 10% ABV. 
Overall: I love the peppers in this beer but just wish more cinnamon was present to balance it out. I shared this with my dad, he hated it. But l loved it and finished the bottle. 914 charactersBenish, Nov 25, 2016

Look is dark brown, minimal to half finger sized lacing.  Leaves great foamy legs around the glass.
Nose is of cocoa nibs and cinnamon.  A great nose, barely can smell any hint of chiles. 
Taste follows the nose but with a tiny hint of the chiles on the finish.  The cocoa nibs and cinnamon make it incredibly smooth and tasty.  Well structured.  
Mouth feel is medium bodied with minimal carbonation.
Overall one of the better stouts I've had.  I wish I had more and definitely want to try the barrel aged version.  Incredibly smooth and an amazing finish. I wanted more than the 22 oz it came in. 642 charactersJay_P22, Oct 10, 2016

Pitch black with a deep brown tinge, no carbonation, half finger of chocolate brown head, and foamy chocolatey legs.
Cocoa, dark chocolate, cinnamon, a hint of heat and dark toasted notes.
Chocolate, cinnamon, coffee, dark chocolate, toasted notes, a light cinnamon, and chilie pepper note. The spicy heat on the end is light. Chocolate and cocoa resonate on the tongue. For a very long time. Hints of cedar all through as it warms.
Medium oily body but very smooth, foamy carbonation. Slick and smooth.
Got at Rincon Tap Room and Bottle

A - Black with thin layer of tan head
S - cinnamon, chocolate, vanilla, and chiles
T - LOTS of cinnamon, some chocolate and vanilla, a little bit of chilies. The beer develops nicely as it warms up and the flavors come together a bit better. 
M - Medium/full bodied with moderate carb.
O - This vintage definitely seems to have taken a step back, rating it where i am because I've had previous years and thought it was fantastic. This one just didn't integrate too well off the bat. 541 charactersNJBrews609, Jul 16, 2016

Keg, snifter, 2015
I wanted this to be awesome but it's just really damn good. Not awesome though. Apparently it's been a lot better in the past, with more chili presence, which is definitely missing in a big way here. There's plenty of cinnamon all over, and chocolate is big, but where are the peppers?
As it stands now it's a really good beer but it didn't live up to the hype. I've had plenty of bomb and I'd take that over this all day. Sorry perennial. 509 charactersJack_Malts, Jun 07, 2016

Pours diesel black with thin rim of dark tan head that never fully dissipates past a ring.  Nose is dominant in cinnamon, but enjoyable.    Taste matched the nose,  not sure if that was due to age,  wanted more chile notes.  They became more noticeable as it warmed,  but still fairly minor.   Mouthfeel was solid,  carbonation on the lower side,  and a finish that lingered a bit with hints of chocolate. 444 charactersjakecattleco, May 31, 2016

Apperance - coal black, with no light penetrating; nonexistent head in the snifter and no lacing. 
Smell - chocolate, vanilla, bourbon, cinnamon and ancho chili!
Taste - flavors from the nose are magnified making this a wonderful sipper!
Feel - big and bold; heavy but very easy to sip! Full flavors stand out and produce a very pleasurable drink from start to finish!
Overall - as good as advertised! Pricey, but you get what you pay for! 501 charactersDenverHopHead, May 29, 2016

4.05/5  rDev -9%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3 |  overall: 4Abraxas pours coffee black, nearing gloppy, with tan, faint whisps of carbonation on the top layer, and soft thin ring of tan foam that dies down to nothing fairly quickly.
Unsweetened chocolate aromas come off first, with some smokey characteristics, and a little fruity vanilla. It begins to smell like a snickerdoodle, then, as it warms I get a distinct olfactory memory of brandy soaked Pain Perdu.
This is the most cinnamon forward of Huna, Mexican Cake, and Xocoveza, yet it's not too intense. There is  just a tickle of capsaicin in the finish, unlike the building heat of Mexican Cake. At times it comes off as minty, like the classic Girl Scout thin mints, but with lots of cinnamon. It is rounded out with some nicely roasty characteristics.
Abraxas is a little thin, contradicting the appearance substantially--it sort of feels like wine, with not much carbonation to speak of. There is a bit of a sharp tang, but it's not quite spicy. If you're down with these flavor profiles, this drinks real easy. 1,015 charactersSabtos, May 19, 2016

DLD line bottle share and this was one of many great beers but the exchange was very memorable. Complete stranger looked at me and the bottle I was pouring and I looked at his bottle of 2013 Abraxas. No words spoken and we both raised our bottles to offer a pour into the other persons snifter. Toasted and enjoyed! Such a great festival!
But back to Abraxas, such a solid balance of ingredients with vanilla starting and strong but pleasant cinnamon finish. Chiles were not very present and might have faded over the years cellaring. Would love to try this on tap on day. Great beer, similar to Bomb! I am sure the BA version of Abraxas is outstanding given this base. 722 charactersGambyt20, May 01, 2016

F- not much carbonation. Creamy.
O- It's well done, but I can't decide how much I like it. At times, the spice overpowers the other flavors. At others it mellows and I enjoy it more. If I get my hands on another one, I'll try to let it warm up a bit first. 588 charactersZoomslowik, Apr 10, 2016

The pepper feel is muted yet lends a warming touch. Lots of complexity. An exceptional beer. 382 charactersBarnoloid, Mar 19, 2016

Cinnamon and bakers spices, peppers, sweet chocolate, and gentle waves of vanilla.
Chocolate, coffee-esque roastiness, vanilla, bakers spices, and a perfect peppery spice to clear the palate.
Heavy-bodied, low carbonation, silky, chewy, wonderfully balanced.
Overall, while I've always been hesitant when in comes to beers brewed with peppers, this is truly a masterpiece. Perfect balance of flavors and a silky smooth and creamy mouthfeel makes this a complex beauty. 579 characterslarryarms847, Mar 10, 2016

Pours jet black with a nice head that sticks around. Smell is decadent - get some cinnamon, chocolate and coffee. Tastes notes of cinnamon, chocolate roasted coffee, molasses and pepper. So many flavors that are married so well. Its amazing how well these flavors just play together - no one flavor is dominant. Feels is really nice - its a strong stout but it doesn't taste/feel that way. So smooth so drinkable. 
Overall this is the best stout I've had - are there ones out there that are better? maybe. But if you can get your hands on it, you will not be disappointed. 668 charactersFBarber, Mar 07, 2016

4.32/5  rDev -2.9%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25This beer pours a jet black motor oil color with just a thin cap of brownish caramel colored head. The head may be small, but it sticks around forever, and there is lots of spotted lacing. The smell is a wonderful mix of milk chocolate, cinnamon, roasted malts, coffee and the slightest bit of heat from the peppers. Taste is similar, but the cinnamon takes center stage with a nice bit of chocolate as well. Just the slightest bit of heat and some roasted malt in the background too. Very sweet. Feel is medium and slick, but lighter than what I would have expected. ABV is not noticeable at all. Overall a great stout, but I prefer bomb! I was told this beer was extremely spicy and to let it mellow, but I'm glad I didn't wait too long. I actually wish there was more heat from the peppers to balance out the sweetness. 822 charactersCNoj012, Mar 03, 2016

4.02/5  rDev -9.7%look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4On tap at Haymarket in NYC. 
6 ounce pour in a snifter. Smell is spicy with cinnamon. Almost too spiced. Notes of chocolate and vanilla even things out. 
The flavor is initially just as overwhelmingly spicy as the nose was, but as I let it sit, it integrates a bit and the chocolatte emerges along with vanilla and coffee and roasted malt notes. 
Not sure if it was the taps I had this from, but both this and Sump felt a bit undercarbonated, to the point of being flat, but at the same time, it kind of accentuates the creamy, full mouthfeel. 
I'll say it once, I'll say it again, Xocoveza undermined every highly tradable spiced stout. This is good, but there's comparable for cheaper prices and more accessible. 718 charactersONovoMexicano, Feb 27, 2016

Pours a deep brown, opaque with swirls throughout, no head at all, some oily lacing.  Smells awesome.  Cinnamon, chocolate, malt, vanilla.  Taste leads more with the malt, but still strong with the cinnamon.  Chocolate, chilies- some low heat, vanilla, little coffee, no bitterness.  Smooth, well carbonated, full bodied- although it's a lighter body.
This is a pretty awesome beer.  The flavors just pop out, a really well blended beer.  The body is a bit lighter than you would expect, but it's in no way thin feeling.  You want to try this, if you can get your hands on it. 660 charactersstortore, Feb 15, 2016

4.58/5  rDev +2.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Serving: 750mL bottle poured into a Founder's taproom snifter. Bottled 11/2015, making this basically 3 months old at this point.
A: Pours a super viscous and oily black. Essentially no head or carbonation whatsoever. Outstanding looking beer.
S: Undeniably up front is a huge wave of cinnamon. If you can get past that, you'll pick out subtle chocolate, vanilla and cake notes. Some milk chocolate sweetness here as well.
T: Again, right up front is that cinnamon wave. Middle of the mouth comes some noticeable chile pepper flavor, but certainly not much heat. Finish is creamy smooth, lots of vanilla and cacao here to round it out. Faint dark chocolate bitterness on the finish as well.
M: Updated for 2016 release, the mouthfeel on this is insane. Last year, came off a bit thin for me, but holy crap, 2016 is super thick. It almost has the consistency of creamer. Best mouthfeel I've had on a stout in a while. Closest thing I can think of is Dark Lord.
O: After missing out on last year's release, I finally snagged a bottle this year. Was fortunate to have this within a couple weeks of Hunahpu and XOCOVEZA for comparison as well. I think I slightly prefer Hunahpu due its greater complexity, depth, and overall better balance, but this one comes darn close. There's some slight balance issues with the heavy cinnamon notes, but the mouthfeel is too large to be ignored. It's still a great beer in the style, and right up there with Bomb! and Huna.
Recommendation: A fantastic beer that stands out among its peers in this style. Definitely worth the chase. 1,571 charactersSparty1224, Feb 02, 2016

Taste - Cinnamon dominates on the palate. Chiles, chocolate, sweetness from the vanilla beans
Feel - Medium creaminess, velvety......not as thick as I was expecting though. 
Overall - My expectations might have been a little too high for this one. Didn't quite live up to them. Good, but not mind blowing. Like Stone's Xocoveza better. 483 charactersTonyjenlasc, Feb 01, 2016

3.96/5  rDev -11%look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4Poured into a snifter.  Bottled 11/2015.
3.75 A:  Black color.  One finger of light brown creamy head.  Retention is about what you'd expect from a beer this big and a few wisps of lacing are left.
4.0 S:  Quite sweet overall.  It starts and finishes with dark chocolate and cocoa nibs.  Slight vegetal pepper from the anchos which meshes well with the cinnamon and vanilla.  Just a touch of dark roast coffee with stronger molasses and caramel.  Supple roastiness that falls behind the chocolate sweetness.  It's a bit more mellow than I was expecting, but it's still pretty good.
4.0 T:  Despite the nose having just hints of coffee in it, the taste is a borderline coffee bomb.  Again the chiles, cinnamon, and vanilla are mellow and complementary.  Just a touch of heat is realized.  Sweet chocolate would be the dominant flavor if the coffee wasn't so abundant.  Moderately sweet throughout but with a roasty bitter finish.  Again, this is good, but the flavors aren't as impressive as the reputation might suggest.
3.75 M:  Lighter heavy body.  Good moderate carbonation.  Mild-moderate creaminess and a mild heat that builds some momentum as it is consumed.
4.0 D:  It's a good beer, but I was expecting quite a bit more.  Honestly, it doesn't hold a candle to the regular Speedway Stout that I had a couple nights ago.  This mixed with the fact that this costs a ton more and is infinitely harder to get a bottle of makes me okay if I never have this again. 1,470 charactersDavoleBomb, Jan 29, 2016

Chili and cinnamon.
Right on the line of just enough spice. Rich, robust but not palate wrecking. Chilis not as strong as in Hunahpu (but it's been a while). The balance reminds me of Prairie Bomb. I can't pick out vanilla but chocolate wraps up all the adjuncts nicely. 
Viscous as a stout should be. 330 characterspants678, Jan 23, 2016

Look: Pitch black, a very small coffee colored head, that dissipated slowly, nice lacing.
Smell: Primarily cinnamon upfront, then the chocolate hits, and the teensiest bit of hot chile scent.
Taste: So Good. Strong cinnamon, strong chocolate, and the heat from the chile is much more present here then on the nose. Not too hot though, still super drinkable.

Overall: 4.73, in my top ten for sure. 636 charactersJkolls, Jan 19, 2016

A — Pours a near pitch black hue with a dark roasted coffee color head on-top. Lacing is left in bits around the edges, just sits in the glass with a rich deliciousness.
S — Smell is a great melange of dark chocolate, bitter espresso, spicy chilies, fresh cinnamon, just a lot going on here. Smells predominately of rich luscious dark chocolate and semi sweet vanilla, a little bit of a cinnamon and chili overtone. Such a great balance of sweetness, smells like a Mexican hot chocolate.
T — Taste is wonderful with huge waves of flavors, ranging from dark chocolate, bitter coffee, chewy vanilla, pithy cinnamon, little bit of a warming chili pepper spiciness on the finish. I almost want to drink this beer warm, it is that good. It is rich and focused on deep dark flavors, showing great balance throughout.
M — Rich, full bodied, thick, not overly heavy though, balanced again.
O — Just spectacular overall, this is a great showcase of dark beer with just a touch of spice. 1,010 charactersMoose90, Jan 19, 2016

pours extremely dark black - like used motor oil in a good way - with dark brown thick head - good lacing.  can't get better for a stout.    lovely aroma of cinnamon, chile and milk chocolate - like hot cocoa.   but the taste isn't cloying.  not overly sweet - complex rich flavors, excellent flavors.   thick body, but super smooth, great feel.

4.24/5  rDev -4.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25On draft, poured into a snifter. 
Appearance: black, thick looking with a coffee-and-cream colored head.
Aroma: this beer smells like waffle batter. Cinnamon and bready with maybe a hint of maple syrup. The cinnamon is the dominant aroma, though.
Flavor: French toast w/o syrup. Sweet, cinnamon and bready. The chili flavor comes through but without much heat, although the heat reaches very mild levels as the beers warms closer to room temperature. No alcohol or alcoholic heat in the flavor. Definitely a unique flavor profile, and the chilis add a great flavor component and another depth. There is no alcohol heat in this beer, but each sip is warming as it goes down. Is that the alcohol or the chilis?
Mouthfeel: medium to medium-heavy. The body is right at the mid-point between the uber-hyped BA-rated imperial stouts. 
Overall: Good but not great.  However, in the week that has lapsed since my tasting, my opinion of this beer and the impression it made on me are trending upward. I would not seek out this beer, but I would likely buy it if I came across it. Better Imperial Stouts are readily available at this price point - or less; Nebraska Brewing BA Black Betty comes to mind. As another comparison, I drank Abraxas side by side with a Prairie Bomb, and the Abraxas was considerably better. 1,312 charactersPray_For_Mojo, Jan 15, 2016

4.48/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Very good beer. I'd compare it to Prairie BOMB! and I think it's quite similar to it. Slight spiciness and big, bold, dark maltiness. My favorite thing about this beer is the strong cinnamon/nutmeg flavor that comes through. One of the reasons why I loved ST Pumking so much the first couple of times that I had it was the strong nutmeg spiciness. While my love of that beer has faded slightly, this beer does a good job reigniting my love for warm, winter spices. 464 charactersBiggtriksta, Jan 12, 2016

S:  I  get overwhelmingly cinnamon spice and sugary sweetness all the way.  Maybe light roast and chocolate.  Though the cinnamon sticks are the show here.
T:  Like the nose, cinnamon sticks, clove allspice.  Really sweet, with some chocolate that becomes more noticeable as this warms.  I don't get much else.  The stout is overwhelmed by the cinnamon.  
M/O:  A big thick and inky/oily body.  Really viscous, but still smooth around the edges.  It is a big stout, and outside the cinnamon there is not much here.  Though still easy to drink, and considering the large sweetness was surprised at how easy this went down.
In many way, this reminds me of Saint Arnold Pumpkinator.  A big beer that is more on the cinnamon spiced side of the spectrum and not the stout side.  Not that there is anything wrong with that, but it becomes to one noted.  With the cinnamon, allspice, clove, sugary sweet aspect, just not among my favorite stouts.  That said, it is still enjoyable, but not exceptional IMO. 1,081 characterschamp103, Jan 11, 2016

A: Dark walnut brown with tan mahogany head. 
S: Cinnamon de leche. Vanilla and cacao. Rum soaked chocolate cake. 
M: Smooth,  velvety. Creamy and med full. Less than expected burn,  chili and alcohol,  otherwise.
T:Fruitiness of pepper on back. Maybe they used smoked Ancho chilis but it compliments the roasting of the grains well. But it is chili for the tame yielding flavor over heat.  Most of any heat I believe is on the form of hot cinnamon, which grasps control from the gentle and rich chocolate and vanilla cake sweetness from the beginning. 581 charactersorcrist_cleaver, Jan 10, 2016

Look: Black with a big Brown frothy head.
Smell: Lots of cinnamon, chocolate, and pepper on the nose. Really nice.
Taste: Much like the nose, get a lot of cinnamon and chocolate. On the tail end you get a nice peppery finish. All these flavors become bolder as the beer warms. The flavors come together in a way that is reminiscent of a cinnamon candle...haha.
Feel: This is where the beer shined. Really velvety mouthfeel. Thick and rich, like a stout should be! Alcohol very well masked.
Overall: I think this beer is awesome, much like everyone else. Haha. It smells fantastic and is as smooth as Velvet. Taste did give me a slightly weird flavor but overall it was still tasty. Seek this one out! Im excited to see how this beer tastes after bourbon barrel aging. 790 characterssittinggc, Jan 05, 2016

Poured into snifter
This was my first own personal "whale". What better time to review it than as my first beer of the year. 
The top popped with the quietest hiss. So excited about this that I sniffed the mouth of the bottle before pouring(almost took a sip, and maybe I did)... A gluggy pour that filled half of the glass left a 1/2" of quickly dissipating brown head gyrating on top of a black pool. Sweet and spicy nose left me ready to dive in. Taste is straight fudge with a peppery POP! I was expecting the spice to have mellowed after a year+ in the bottle, but it was there in force. Nice med-thick, slick feel with minimal carbonation(almost perfect for the style). Heat creeps in, and just compounds on the palate with each sip. This gets WAY better as it warms.  It gives way to  some of the flavors that were overpowered by the spice, like vanilla. Great beer, but not mind blowing. Along the lines of BOMB! and Imperial Blud, but I would have to side-by-side to pick out my favorite. 1,015 charactersLloydDobler, Jan 05, 2016

This is a superbly balanced imperial stout.  I'm not typically a big fan of stouts brewed with peppers but this was so very subtle and in my opinion brought out the sweet chocolaty flavors.  There was just a barley noticeable zip with the addition of peppers, but so well melded together.  Very smooth, very rich, very sweet with zip.  Will definitely be adding this to my annual wish list.  I highly recommend this beer to others. 536 charactersCarb-Overlord, Jan 01, 2016

This has the edge over Prairie Bomb for me and it's entirely due to the mouthfeel, one of the best I've ever had in an imperial stout. Velvety, rich, creamy, and perfect amount of spice and heat. I wish it were snowing outside so I can peer through the window watching the flakes fall in the moonlit winter evening with the only sound of the cracking from the fireplace. Damn this CA weather!

Tastes is strong dark cocoa, cinnamon and sweet molasses notes forward with pleasant transition to chili burn or tingle – balances out the sweetness without injecting bitterness. Akin to some of the Mexican chocolate stouts (e.g. chocolate sombrero from  clown shoes or calvera Mexican imperial stout) – with emphasis on the cinnamon/vanilla . Mouthfeel was medium bodied, scant carbonation and pleasant lingering finish akin to a good desert beer or aperitif. ABV well hidden by the flavors.
Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this beer – well balanced and interesting without being too spicy or using adjuvants excessively – a solid stout. 748 charactersThaneMcC, Dec 22, 2015
4.49/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5On tap at Apex last night.
Black with a nice brown head. Nose is a beautiful blend of cinnamon, chocolate, molasses, a touch of nutmeg and ancho chilis. The palate opens with sweet cinnamon, molasses, buckwheat honey, burnt sugar,  milky coffee. A little chili pepper flavor, a touch smoky, pairing very nicely with the malt base. Brilliant full body with soft creamy carbonation and long finish with honey, chocolate and cinnamon. The malt base here is more creamy and chocolatey rather than heavy on the black patent or similarly bitter malts, really allowing the more fragrant cinnamon to carry the palate. Delicious. 621 charactersDefenCorps, Dec 22, 2015

The flavor brings those peppers and pie spices hinted at on the nose, but in moderation, and against a chocolatey backdrop. Notes of smoke and creamy vanilla waft throughout. Caramel, toffee and maple syrup sweetness brings up the rear. Just a very mild chipotle burn around the edges. 
Astoundingly understated and in your face at the same time. An extremely well melded beer. Hats off to Perennial, as this and Sump are two of the best imperial stouts on the market. 522 charactersMongrel, Dec 17, 2015

L: Black with very little head. Lots of lacing on the glass. Looks like a nice sticky stout.
S: Cinnamon, dark chocolate, vanilla, chilli, and milk chocolate.
T: Follows the nose with tons of cinnamon and dark chocolate. Almost no roasted malt or bitterness. Taste similar to a cinnamon roll. 
F: Creamy, full bodied mouthfeel. Leaves the mouth feeling sticky, like you just ate caramel. Very drinkable for 10%.

Pours pitch black with virtually no signs of carbonation, although a thin ring of light brown bubbles forms around the edges of the glass. Nice aroma of sweet dark toasted malt, cinnamon, chocolate and a hint of hot peppers, quite reminiscent of Mexican chocolate. Flavor follows, with rich chocolaty dark toasted malt, cinnamon, vanilla and a pleasant, light chili burn in the finish. Medium to heavy creamy body and adequate carbonation in the mouth feel despite the visible absence. A very nice, velvety and rich chocolate and spice infused stout. The resemblance to Mexican chocolate is appealing and flavorful. Spicing and the chilis are done deftly. Very tasty and enjoyable. The price point is scary, but it delivers on the taste and experience. 790 charactersLiquidAmber, Dec 14, 2015

F: Relatively low carbonation. Was expecting a more sticky texture, but it's fairly thin.
O: Was expecting alot more. Truly a hype beer, since there are alot of spiced imperial stouts that taste better. This reminded me of a cinnamony Stone Xocoveza. Price is double its actual value. 574 charactersXenoreactive, Dec 12, 2015
3.96/5  rDev -11%look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4Pitch black and completely opaque with a one finger mocha head that immediately fades into a thin ring.  Minimal spotty lacing left behind.  Nice color but this beer has poor head retention and lacks lacing.
Slightly spicy, roasted dark malt aroma with silky dessert-like sweetness and a zesty pepper presence.  Lots of cinnamon and chili pepper in the nose along with faint vanilla bean.  Decent amour of robust dark malt with coffee bean, burnt sugar, toast and oatmeal.  Luscious silky chocolate character with cocoa bean, bakers chocolate, caramel, toffee and moist chocolate cake. Smells pretty good with a nice balance of spice, peppers, roast and sweeter malt. Was expecting more pepper but there's a decent amount of chocolate and cinnamon.
Fuller end of medium body with a blast of spicy cinnamon and a zesty pepper kick that lingers throughout.  The cinnamon is really, really strong and along with the chili dominates the palate.  Underneath, there is a complex malt bill with robust dark roast and dessert-like chocolate sweetness.  Cocoa really comes through as it warms with fudge and molasses sweetness.  Slightly burnt tasting but not acrid with coffee, charred toast, oatmeal and subtle smoke.  Smoked peppers are strong and cinnamon is a bit overpowering.  chocolate malts balance things out with some dessert/cake sweetness, licorice and caramel.  Nice beer but the spices are a bit strong for my preference, making this beer slightly one dimensional.  My palate adjusted to the heat/peppers after a while and I'm really enjoying those flavors. 1,565 characterscorby112, Dec 12, 2015

It's bigger, and has a fuller (and more syrupy) feel, but I didn't think the taste, or overall experience, was some order of magnitude better.  In fact, it may even be slightly worse.  At 1/2 the price, I'd have liked this a lot more.  As it was, I don't think I'll ever need to have it again. 436 charactersEdwardAbbey, Dec 12, 2015

Look - Standard black stout look.  Pretty much completely black
Smell - Smells delicious.  Like horchata, cinnamon, chocolate, and stout.  I kept going back and smelling over and over again.  amazing
Taste - completely unique and really outstanding.  all the flavors melded perfectly but nothing was overpowering or out of balance.  really great.  the cinnamon and chili flavors really come through, but the stout flavor balances everything out.  Vanilla and chocolate also present
Overall, I really liked this beer.
I had a 2015 right afterwards and didnt like it as much.  the cinnamon and chili flavors were much more muted.  still very good, but the 2014 was far superior 739 charactersderftron, Dec 04, 2015

The brew appears black in color with a khaki head that holds decent. This smells nutty with chocolate, licorice, roast and coffee. The taste is more like earthy licorice and anise meets char, tobacco and peppers. This is medium in body with modest carbonation. Overall not a bad brew but considering the hype and hysteria ive heard over this beer I guess I was expecting a little more. Wouldnt mind revisiting this one again but considering the price and rarity I doubt id chase after it. 555 charactersstakem, Dec 03, 2015

Aroma is incredible chocolate, mocha coffee, touch of spice.  The taste is rich chocolate, coffee, just a hint of the pepper and cinnamon but not enough to ditract. The flavor and ever present aroma made this just a delishious brew. Super soft creamy mouthfeel. Overall exceeded expectations, put this right up there with the best stouts. Want another bottle. 455 charactersNolaHopHead, Oct 16, 2015

The cacao dominates the taste. It may be due to the face that it's nearly a year old, but there is no heat from the ancho peppers. It's very nice, I love getting that flavor, mildly tobacco, without being overwhelmed by heat. Velvety mouthfeel. Would love to try the barrel aged version. 398 charactersJustinbshelton, Oct 03, 2015

Poured well, smelled OK, but nothing (not even the chilies) made it through the cinnamon.  Harsh finish with a touch of what felt like fusel alcohol.  Feel was good, but then you remembered how overpowering the cinnamon was and gagged anyway...
Had this on 2 separate occasions, and age does tame it down a bit, but Huna and Prairie Bomb achieve significantly better balance of flavors 535 characterspagriley, Aug 29, 2015

Beats Huna, Bomb! and mayyybe Mexi Cake in a knock-down drag out fight for Tastiest Brew of the subgenre. 
Look is dark, no real head present. Smell is strong cinnamon, some cocoa. Taste is a lot of the same as the nose, but with a slight chili finish. Great mouthfeel, and goes very well with some cowboy spice rubbed steaks. 
Definitely no disappointment, and will keep this one on my 'wants' list. 559 charactersthatoneguymike, Aug 10, 2015

Cinnamon forward, but some chocolate, a hint of ash.   A faint hint of ethanol and a trace of vanilla from the barrel.  Chilis come out a bit more as it opens up.  Taste is pretty sweet of cinnamon with other notes more mellow: some more milky like chocolate.   Very faint return of mild chili,  very muted.  Body is touch lighter and less carbed.   Alcohol Heat present on taste and finish a bit more than Huna. 529 charactersBugs318, Jul 31, 2015

Thanks to themadhanner for sending this one over via trade.
A: Opaque black with some browning on the edges.  Less than 1/2 a fingers width of tan colored head dissipates fairly quickly and leaves essentially zero lacing.  4.25
S: Huge cinnamon, not sure I’ve ever gotten this much cinnamon in a beer before (maybe a pumpkin beer but never a stout). I also get a really nice dark cocoa aroma, and some chili heat that sings the nostril.  Rossy characters and very subtle booze rounds it all out.  Just a fantastic aroma.  4.75
T: Chocolate is initially the most prominent flavor, and its a nice dark cocoa type chocolate flavor.  The pepper heat is definitely noticeable, mostly with the spicy bite it leaves on the finish.  A subtle cinnamon, but not nearly to the degree of the aroma.  Roasty characters and a bit of boozy ethanol complete the palate profile.  Chile characters grow throughout the drink, both in heat and peppery taste, as do the boozy characters.  4.25
M/D: Medium body, carbonation appropriately low, mouthfeel a bit thin, some beer from the peppery heat, and ABV is overly noticeable.  3.75
O: Very good beer.  Taste definitely does live up to the aroma, and you progress throughout the drink, it because somewhat dominated by chile heat and booze.  Not my favorite chile stout, but certainly worth a drink!  4.25 1,391 characterszac16125, Jul 30, 2015

That rich chocolate is joined by cinnamon and pepper in a near perfect balance. Not getting much vanilla, but there is a little coffee roast to balance the sweet chocolate. They got the chillies just right on this. Not overpowering, but spice cotes the mouth and throat adding to the mouth feel which is medium to full bodied. Excellent stout which is not far behind hunahpu. 452 charactersdanh53, Jun 25, 2015

Very nice blend of crushed, fresh cinnamon and subtle spice. Unlike the first time I had it, this is very well balanced. The aroma is tremendous. Nice spicy finish that scratches your throat just so. 
World-class? Not sure about that... but a delightful brew nonetheless.

Smell: peppers, cinnamon and chocolate to mocha. 
Taste: opens with spicy peppers, some cinnamon filters in. mocha and chocolate. notes of espresso but with a bit of smoothness from vanilla. some booze and ends with a bit more pepper
Mouthfeel: heavy , strong carbonation and some heat from the peppers.
Overall: strong spices and could be more chocolatey. If your into spiced beers go for it but I prefer more malt character 596 charactersSportsandJorts, May 19, 2015

A- pours  pitch black with a motor oil thickness, small creamy khaki colored head reduces quickly, leaving just a ring around the edge 
S- lots of vegetal green pepper on the nose up front.  As it warms, it begins to open with aromas of cinnamon, vanilla bean, chocolate, sandalwood, brown sugar, molasses, black licorice, toasted marshmallow & a hint of coffee
T- deep and rich chocolate and cocoa base gives way to flavors of sweet molasses and burnt brown sugar.  Cinnamon spice, along with black pepper mix with subtle vanilla, giving a heavy cream sweetness.  The pepper flavor becomes green and vegetal as it nears the finish, with hints of dark fruit accompanying.  The heat of the pepper kicks in on the finish, with lingers of chocolate & cinnamon
M- thick and viscous body with moderate-low carbonation leads to a creamy mouthfeel and a silky and velvety warming finish, with a linger of heat after the finish 
O- a slow sipper of an ale that is loaded with flavor, yet blends them near perfectly.  Nice amount of heat on the linger 1,104 charactersTreyliff, May 19, 2015

4.49/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a dark brown, which settles into the glass with a cola-colored body and a thin tan head. Aroma is all over the place. Vanilla is strong, hints of smokey peppers, dashes of spices (nutmeg?), even a hint of a minty herbal quality. Wow, after the pour and the nose I did not expect such big, potent flavors. Vanilla, spice, roasted peppers, all big and all in harmony. Some unsweetened Cocoa comes through as well. Feel is medium-full bodied, but not thick. Medium carbonation and a slight lingering burn. Not sure if it's the pepper heat, or the abv (thinking the latter). This is a rich and robust stout with some big flavors. Not sure where the mint was coming from, but it seemed to linger for me throughout. I think I like Huna a tad more, but this is impressive. A side-by-side of the two would be amazing. 815 charactersstephenjmoore, May 09, 2015

Pours a deep mocha, coffee colored body with a light chocolate colored head that reduces slowly, leaving little lacing but some good retention. 
Aromas of milk chocolate, vanilla, bourbon (I know it's not barrel aged, but I still seem to get this note), some soy, slight peppers and cinnamon in the background.
On the tongue upfront is tons of milk chocolate and vanilla notes, caramel, some pepperiness on the follow through, the finish is roasty, toasty, roasted coffee, char. Mouthfeel is thick and rich, low carbonation. 
Overall a very well crafted stout.. wish I got a little more cinnamon and pepper as advertised, but maybe those were just sitting in the background to create some nice balance that this beer exhibited well. 814 charactersgcamparone, May 06, 2015

Smell was cinnamon, some vanilla, and a hint of black licorice.  Taste was also very cinnamon forward, got some vanilla and a little chocolate, but mostly cinnamon with a late chile and alcohol burn.  Mouthfeel was great with spices tickling the Rouge and a good body. Overall this was a good beer, but too cinnamon dominated to call it great. 424 charactersOneEye78, Apr 18, 2015

A: Thick, almost syrupy burnt brown with a dark mocha head. Definitely getting some garnet tones there, though that might just be my mind projecting the Abraxas label onto the glass. Good-looking stuff
S: Lots going on here: cinnamon in spades, cola and rootbeer, ripe cherries, raw hot peppers or maybe Red Hots, and tree bark. Good stuff individually, but the nose didn't quite come together for me. More of a mishmash (of good aromas), not "well integrated."
T: Lots of quite bitter dark chocolate, sweet cinnamon, chocolate-covered espresso beans, a bit of cherries and ripe red fruit, and some pepper skin. Chili heat is present, too. Again, lots of good elements at play here, but they just don't come together or blend that well: one or another of the flavors tends to dominate each sip, rather than each component being present in each sip.
M: Just right, I think. Not too thick: smooth, lightly carbed, and a touch viscous. Nice tingle (rather than a burn) on the finish. Aftertaste is dry, bitter, and charred.
O: Really good stuff. Lots of great elements at work on the nose and the flavor profile, but those elements tend to clash against -- rather than complement -- each other. So not as complex or outstanding a beer as Huna, but very enjoyable nonetheless. 1,355 charactersblankenhoney, Mar 25, 2015

4.73/5  rDev +6.3%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75I recently had Huna I have had Bomb in the past so far I still think Bomb is the best, but this one does edge out Huna, next will be Mexican Cake to finish off the big 4 Horseman. 
Appearance: Black as night, head is relative to the type of beer. Kind of light around the edges with swirls in the middle of tan creamy head. 
Aroma: Initially I got cinnamon as a strong characteristic. After a while sweeter dark fruits join the bouquet of aromas. Nicely done, its pretty complex on the nose. 
Taste: I can tell the cinnamon, some sour yeasty note is present but it isn't off putting at all its just there, it could also be the peppers. The taste is cleaner and not very sweet, but just sweet enough. I liked the heat that hits the lips and tongue as it warms. Very nicely done beer. Its also less cloying than Huna came off to me and to the others who drank these with me. 
Overall: I did like this one more than Huna, now after almost exactly a year the 2014 Huna I drank might have lost some impact, this bottle is not as old, they came out in (early November?) I believe so it has held its adjunct impact pretty well in that amount of time, now after a year in bottle like Huna I may be saying the same thing. I really need to revisit Huna as soon as I can to give it a more thorough analysis. So far, however, I still like the heat and earthiness of Bomb the best of the ones I have tried from this style. This is a close second. Love the cinnamon impact, goes really well with the combination of flavors they are working with. 1,535 charactershumuloner22, Mar 19, 2015

Smell of milk chocolate, cinnamon, and a touch of chili.
Taste is mostly milk chocolate with a nice soft burn from the ancho chili throughout -- a little stronger on the finish. Chili provides a nice dryness and savory spice to the feel. 332 charactersIan_B, Mar 11, 2015

Nice body with tons of great cinnamon flavor and finishes with a little peppery/spice from the ancho chiles.  Picked up on some vanilla which pairs well with the cinnamon. All around great beer. 406 charactersboothbeer, Mar 09, 2015

Very good imperial stout with all the usual characteristics of a very well made IS. Met the hype. Thought it might be in vein of Hunahpu...but no. Found flavor unbalanced with cinnamon  way too dominant. Ended up being a "spiced" IS more lent to Christmas than otherwise. Will keep remaining bottles to age for the holidays. 373 charactersBillRoth, Mar 07, 2015

Cinnamon and peppers dominate the smell. The mouthfeel is smooth but not overly spectacular. 
The taste is exceptional. Mostly cinnamon followed by a subtle spiciness from the peppers. I don't get a ton of vanilla but I do get a little bit of the malty, roasty imperial stout flavor.
This beer is great. I full bomber might be a little much but this small pour left me wanting a little bit more. 421 charactersmjpolzin, Feb 28, 2015

Aroma is rich bitter dark chocolate, roasty dark malt, hint of espresso, molasses.
Taste is bittersweet baker's chocolate, cinnamon, spicy chile peppers, cacao nibs. As it warms, vanilla, caramel and coconut. The chile heat puts high notes on the chocolate and brings layers of complexity. A touch of spicy heat on the finish.
Mouthfeel is thick and full-bodied, but not syrupy or chewy. Good bright carbonation.
Overall just wow. Like a molé beer. Very Aztec. Or Maya. Not sure which. Ingredients are pure and clean, and work so well together. 622 charactersdraheim, Feb 28, 2015

Appearance- Deep black coffee body with a tan crema head with a little retention
Smell- Coffee and roasted barley base before yielding to a strong foundation of toasted anchos and a little nose of tired cinnamon sticks. There is a little sweetness like molasses. I don't get the charred or burnt flavors that others mention. 
Taste - Warm, toasted similar to the nose. The flavor is deep and lingers after each sip coating your mouth. The muted spice of the ancho stays until the next sip counted by a touch of sweetness. 
Seek it out on draft. If you want to rave about the other chili spiced stouts, visit the granddaddy of them all. 766 charactersTubaManJack, Feb 27, 2015

Looks like the darkest chocolate, so brown its almost black. Smells sweet, vanilla and a little coffee.  The flavor is awesome. Everything is in balance: pepper, cinnamon, vanilla, cacao. Gets even better as it warms. There's a sweetness to is, almost like bourbon barrel. Vanilla? Then, there's the lingering pepper burn on the end.
Overall, a great beer. I want to drink this head to head with other non-BA pepper beers like Hunahpu, Bomb!, and whatever else I have that is comparable.
Update:
Went head to head w/ Hunahpu! Very close. More boozy/vanilla, more foam, slightly thinner but not a thin stout, more carbonation, slightly bitter pepper aftertaste. Super tough to choose a favorite. Pluses and minuses. Slightly different. Both Awesome. 823 charactersGetalegup, Feb 23, 2015

Appearance:  completely and utterly black with a nice finger of creamy tan foam atop.  It looks quite amazing.
Smell:  rich, sweet, creamy aroma of vanilla, chocolate, a hint of coffee, dark fruit, raisin and spice.  Massively complex and enticing; I love it.
Taste:  the flavor is just like the aroma, except more.  Rich vanilla, raisin, date, cinnamon, a light spiciness; it reminds me a lot of Mexican chocolate.  It's amazing and delightful and I'm so glad I was able to get a bottle of this.
Mouthfeel:  big, rich body with an exceedingly smooth creaminess.  Wonderful.

4.13/5  rDev -7.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4750ml bottle, 2014 release, poured into a Goose Island Bourbon County Stout snifter.
The beer pours a jet black color, thick, inky with a big caramel head, nearly 3 fingers with an aggressive pour that nice nice retention with spotted lace. The aroma has tons of chocolate, chili pepper, cinnamon, stone fruits and rich grain. It's as advertised, plenty of the adjuncts, balanced quite well, though simple in its own right. The flavors echo the nose, loads of chocolate, plenty of chili pepper, a touch of heat, but delightful roasty and earthy flavors, cinnamon is there, fruit, toasted coffee bean, toeing the line between earthy, sweet, and rich. The mouthfeel is so nice, coating, soft, smooth, lively carbonation that isn't abrasive, full bodied with a lightly dry finish.
Verdict: A very nice stout from Perennial, definitely puts the select ingredients in the spotlight. Nice balance and interplay, simple in that there isn't a lot going on beyond those adjuncts, but impressive in how complex they can feel and how nicely they go together. 1,050 characterskevanb, Jan 30, 2015

L: Black with a red hue.  Absolutely no head and I attributed it to timing but I was told by a friend that when I poured from his bottle he had zero head as well.
S: Sweet smell with vanilla and cinnamon.  The smell was absolutely fantastic.
T: Boozy with sweet cocoa taste blended nicely with vanilla and cinnamon.  Nice little pepper burn on the backend.  
F: Was a little disspointed, as I was hoping for some more heavy feel.  In my opinion it is what was keeping this beer from being on the same level as Hunahpu and Bomb.
O: I think my overall impression of disspointment is not a result of the beer but not living up the hype.  Also, the competition is pretty stiff in the pepper stout category.  I would love to give this another try and do a head to head with Bomb, Dark Lord, and Hunahpu. 847 charactersClint_Yoho, Jan 27, 2015

S--Really nice!  Cinnamon, anchos, dark chocolate, raisins?
T--Unreal.  Sweetness comes through but not overdone (see Dark Lord), cinnamon is there but in a complimentary role, while the dark chocolate/roasted malts are absolutely delicious.  It moves through the flavors seamlessly.
M--Very thick, creamy, slick!  Not sure if its the chiles or the booze but it warms the chest.
O: Glad to finally check this off my list.  I'm not a huge fan of the style, and can really appreciate when I encounter an Imperial Stout that is so complex and balance.  This is the best imperial stout I've ever had. 658 charactersTbub18, Jan 26, 2015

A - Shiny black body with cola highlights.  Fine rim of mocha colored foam with nice retention, but no lace.
S - Sweet gingerbread, caramel, brown sugar, vanilla malt, cinnamon, allspice, bitter cocoa, and raisiny chilies.
T - Fantastic profile.  Sweeter than the nose, but with similar notes.  Smooth, sweet dark brown sugar and rich gingerbread pave the way for powerful accents of cinnamon, molasses, bitter dark chocolate, a soft raisiny chili heat.  Lingering vanilla, dry chocolate malted milkshake, and capsaicin warm through the finish.  
M - Really nice, silky smooth, medium-full body.  Great staying power through the finish.
O - A delicious take on a Mexican Stout, and a great beer in its own right.  Compared to Hunahpu (still the gold standard for the style in my mind) the cinnamon and chili notes are bolder, but have slightly less integration. 928 charactersvfgccp, Jan 25, 2015

5/5  rDev +12.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5The beer pours thick, and has a muted carbonation. The body is slightly lighter than might be expected, but lands firmly in the "full" category. The feel is creamy and only slightly oily slick.
The flavor lays down a heavy baseline of rich malt, a touch of smokey roast, and dry cocoa. Playing of the underlying flavor is a bright mix of cinnamon and smokey spice. Midsip, the roast comes through more strongly, the spice dimension is more pronounced, and the flavor slides toward the drier side of the scale. 
The lingering flavor mixes unsweetened chocolate, sweet smoke, cinnamon, and dry malt. It is also worth noting, that despite not being all that sweet, it does a fine job masking the alcohol. 
All in this is a genius beer in both formulation and execution. It deserves its standing as a top of the heap beer. 821 charactersspoonhawk, Jan 23, 2015

Abraxas is a great overall stout (roasty, cocoa, vanilla), with a spicier profile than either of the other Impy Stouts.  Cinnamon is what I got most, in aroma and taste.  I didn't pick up as much chile pepper heat as others seem to, but being a chile head of sorts, it probably takes a pretty good dose of pepper to make me notice.  I saw a bit of chile influence.
It's a great stout, and I'd love to find bottles around Seattle some day. 603 charactersVashonGuy, Jan 17, 2015

A- Pure black to a snifter. Tan cap to under a finger with a frothy creamy consistency. Medium ring means spotty lace and a few sheets.
S- Huge earthy cinnamon leads the way for vegetal charred anchos, huge raisins, cocoa powder, charred barley and something like vanilla sweetness.
T- Again a massive earthy and woody cinnamon leads the flavor all the way. Beyond that is pretty much the aroma with cocoa, coffee, vanilla sweets, brown sugar, raisins and dark dry fruits, hot chocolate and some chile spiciness.
MF- Thick body but a shade toward the medium side of things. Slick decadence and a texture overall that is creamy and foamy. Finishes with warmth, chile heat and roasty bitterness.
Sort of in the Hunahpus and Xocoveza league but this one falls a bit short of them both for me. Great profile of dark roasted character with all of the fun stuff added. 945 characterscbutova, Jan 15, 2015

A - Pitch Black with a mocha/hazelnut head.  Sticky/heavy foam, leaving some beautiful lace half way through the glass.  
S - Rich milk chocolate, vanilla, smoked toffee with some chili/alcohol notes.  The ancho chili smell is a little off putting.   
T - Taste is pretty similar to the smell.  Huge Chocolate Malts, Toffee.  The back end of this beer is pretty superb.  The chilies are present (heat), cinnamon blending in perfectly in the finish.  Then the 10% ABV becomes very apparent, once I exhaled.  Lingering heat (chilies) which continues to build over the course of the beer.  Excellent!
M - The body was moderate to thick motor oil.  Rich chocolate with lingering and excelling heat from the chilies.  Very Hot (alcohol).  
O -  It's a crazy beer.  The chili aspect was a nice curve ball, from the smell/nose and lingering long after I took a drink.   The body/flavors/alcohol compliments each other so well.  I can't wait to try my other bottle in a year or two and see how this beast changes. 1,086 charactersDeepJello, Jan 09, 2015

Color was dark murky brown, almost black.  Very opaque with a one finger tan head that dissipated quickly.  Minimal lacing.  Smell is 'cinnamon raisin bread" - lots of raisins, bready malt and cinnamon.  Flavor is  sweet raisin bread on the palate that gives way to a bit of an alcohol/pepper bite on the finish.  Body is full, thick and creamy.  Not as viscous as it looks.
Overall, this is a damn fine stout that I was surprised and delighted  to find on tap in my neck of the woods.. 535 charactersmr-jj, Dec 30, 2014

4.5/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5On tap at the E9 last night.  Served in an 8 ounce tulip.
The beer pours a blackish brown color with very good head retention and lacing.  The beer is a bit thick and viscous looking, something that was replicated on the palate.  On the nose, I pick up a lot of dark chocolate and vanilla, along with a hint of chili pepper as well.  On the nose, this beer is so rich and sweet, it's almost too much.  Granted, the noticeable heat from the ancho chiles, and the considerable spice help to counter that sweetness somewhat, but even so, it's hard to imagine drinking a whole lot of this at a sitting.  Mouthfeel is soft, smooth, full and very long.  Alcohol is well integrated into the flavor profile, but even so, the combination of high alcohol and considerable sweetness wear out the palate pretty quickly.  
An impressive beer, no doubt, but the richness was almost too much of a good thing.  Even so, this is a delicious beer, and one I was happy to try at long last. 972 charactersJohn_M, Dec 28, 2014

Bottle to Perennial Tulip
750ml
2014 vintage
Thank you KevanB for the hookup
App-  Right out of the bottle it's a bit like any other stout. A mix of dark browns, and some inky blacks. A bit of a red tinge and is very dense in the center. A good 2-1/2 finger head which is a soda like puffy brown which pops like a pancake batter.
Smell- On the nose I get a ton of the ancho. It's spicy and fragrant with a dash of spicy. A bit of the cinnamon comes in and creates a small aromatic vortex. I don't get most of the adjuncts in terms of vanilla. Slightly sweet as well. A little bitter from the nibs.
Taste- I think to me this is a step above Bomb! The flavors are melded more together and create more of a creamy flavor. Not as bitter because of the lack of coffee and I think its key. The flavors are well rounded and keep coming in waves. Creamy at first with the stout base and then a bit spicy from ancho and the cinnamon adds a prickly type of finality.
Mouth- This is a medium bodied stout with a lower carbonation level but yields a creamy flavor. All of the flavors blend well and as mentioned above the removal of the coffee makes each layer a bit more unique and flavorful. The base stout makes the lushness that much better.
Drink- Well!!! This was a long time coming and so good!!! This beats out Bomb! The removal makes the flavors pop more and creates more lushness and richness. A bit more vanilla would've been nice. I ain't mad at you Perenial!! 1,487 charactersFosterJM, Dec 23, 2014

4.49/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5On draft at Chuck's 85th.  This is really an exceptional beer.  Pours murky dark with a tan, frothy head which dissipates quickly.  Aroma of vanilla caramel, cocoa, cinnamon, raisin, roasted malt.  Sweet on the tongue, some earthy notes, followed by some fire from the alcohol and peppers.  Very creamy, full-bodied, lightly carbonated, huge and long finish.  Truly a pleasure to drink. 386 charactersPacNWDad, Dec 21, 2014
4.54/5  rDev +2%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Many thanks to Michael fot the bottle. 2013 Vintage.
Pours a brown, bubbly head, which disappears soon, while yielding a jet black color.
Smells of roasted malts, molasses, vanilla, honey, dried berries, cocoa nibs and a gentle amount of coffee. Underneath lies a layer of organic, herbal, slightly hot chilies.
Earthy, toasted malts and bakers chocolate build the foundation, with sweeter malts on top of them, including molasses, cane sugar, syrup and a hint of dried dark berries. The uprising sweetness gets balanced by creamy milk chocolate, cocoa nibs, cinnamon and spicy, then peppery, burning, herbal chilies. The chocolate qualities get complimented by a noteable amount of bitter coffee, which got a dry note to it. The taste of this beer in general is extremely versatile, it begins silk and creamy, and while it remains throughout smooth, it gets quite a bit heat to it, resulting from the chilies, acting as a convincing counterpoint to the upwelling sweetness, while accentuating the earthy malts and pleasantly bitter coffee. Has a very long finish, beginning right after the chili bite, along with a coffeish bitterness and an earthy note, as well as a toffee glimpse, while the chili burn warms up the belly. Every single flavor is put outstandingly well into this brew, all components unfold on the palate in an enjoyable way, while none dominates the taste on its own. 1,390 charactersaleigator, Dec 21, 2014

5/5  rDev +12.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Rushed out of work early to get to Trappist Provisions in Oakland. The bottles were long gone, but didn't want to take any chances on missing this on-tap, especially with the vanilla being there, too.
So, for me, like Mexican Cake, this is a perfect beer and I have no hesitation in giving it a perfect score. Rich, sweet, spiced stouts hit the absolute heights of my taste preferences, and what beer hits that profile more dead-on than this one? Like a boozy mexican hot chocolate. Spices integrated perfectly. Just the right amount of heat from the peppers. Dreaming of the BBA version. Five stars out of five. 613 charactersronricorossi, Dec 19, 2014

4.75/5  rDev +6.7%Abraxas is a beer that I have not been able to get in Colorado but found at a local restaurant on the bottle list.  I was extremely surprised.  I have drank but not rated a lot of stouts before this.  This ranks as one of my favorite ever.   Smooth, rich, creamy and the cocao nibs follow through.  This beer is extremely balanced and a must have for stout lovers if they get a chance. 385 charactersKCSerdy, Dec 03, 2014

A: Jet black with minimal head.  Poured thick.
S:  Very hard to describe.  Is that the alcohol heat I smell, the cinnamon, or the peppers?  It all blends together.  Second whiff I pickup some chocolate notes.  Just a pleasure to smell.  
T:  Very similar to the smell.  There is a spicy element that is a blend of heat and cinnamon on top of a roasted malt flavor.
M:  Residual burn/sweetness that stays with you.
O:  This beer is fantastic.  It is a great blend of chilies and cinnamon such that both elements compete against one another, with neither gaining the upper hand.  Definitely worth the praise it gets.  The complexity this beer brings to the table blows other beers out of the water.
Edit:  I've had this beer multiple times since original review, and it still impresses every time I have it.  Some occasions I pick up more the cinnamon, while others a get a stronger chocolate presence.  I should also add that the beer a some nice "legs" on the glass when swirled. 1,023 charactersgibgink, Nov 27, 2014

Medium thickness on the mouthfeel with a lower carb. Really wish this was fresh. I'll have to seek out a fresher bottle for next time. As it stands it goes MC > Huna > Abrax. 3.75
Update: Had a bottle that was accidentally aged a while back and didn't think too highly of it. Getting huge chili pepper skin and cinnamon sticks in the nose. Bitter coffee and dark chocolate, black strap molasses, more chili pepper skin and a decent amount of cinnamon on the finish that makes it super dry. Very minimal, boarding on nonexistent chili heat. This is heads and shoulders better that the aged one I had. Drink fresh.  I would still go with MC > Huna > Abrax.  Much closer though. 771 charactersDavepoolesque, Oct 20, 2014

Pours Deep black, with mocha head, light head retension, silky as it hits the glass.
Mocha head melts away, leaves some legs on the glass.
Aroma: At first this was Chilled to the max and i got an Irony metallic nose up front, after this sat for a half hour, i was able to get The bold cocoa, Deep espresso roast, Brown sugar, Cinnamon and a hint of the Chile ... very sweet molasses and cinnamon come through after a few swirls.
Taste: Almost identical to the Aroma, Great Dark chocolate, Cocoa, Sweet molasses, a hint of the chile right before the cinnamon takes over ending on a combination of cinnamon and dark chocolate.
Mouthfeel: Very viscous, coats the mouth with the first initial drink, creamy, almost like a melted malt. full bodied finishes with a hint of dryness. 
Overall: This beer is very balanced for what it has going on, im guessing this beer fresh might be a little over spiced, id like to have this fresh at some point to see if theres more Chile heat. this beer is great , i will be seeking more in the future. 1,054 charactersjonandhisflask, Sep 22, 2014

Spice is too over powering and nasty....  to me it tastes very artificial (although probably not).  
We had KBS, Grey Monday, and then this...  even in this order this beer/spice was so...  obnoxiously fragrant and overpowering, our tasting group couldn't finish this bottle. 336 characterssukwonee, Sep 15, 2014

Poured into oversize snifter.  You simply must let this beer warm to room temp..while chilled, The cinnamon is clearly the alpha in regard to the spice influence...I can't say that I can grab any ancho chiles nor vanilla..maybe a tad chocolate? But as it warmed I can taste the vanilla influence as well.  Such a wonderful beer I absolutely love it. 443 charactersbowzer4birdie, Jul 09, 2014

An aggressive pour yields a beautiful pitch black body with a quickly fading one finger caramel-colored head with minimal lacing. Rich, roasty, complex nose with lots of cocoa up front along with hints of cinnamon, dark chocolate, vanilla, subtle coconut, and the chilies are surprisingly prevalent as well. The taste is big and rich and just as complex as the nose. Loads of roasty cocoa and cinnamon up front with the chilies not far behind. Hints of chocolate fudge, coconut, vanilla, tobacco, and espresso. The mouthfeel is rich and flavorful, thick and creamy, with perfect carbonation and excellent balance. Overall, this was a hugely enjoyable beer and not far behind the barrel-aged version. The cinnamon, cocoa, and chilies were bold, yet equally represented and this was extremely drinkable for a 10% ABV beer. Highly recommended! 903 charactersbeerdrifter, Jun 14, 2014

From bottle into a 10oz Perennial Snifter on a nice afternoon on my deck as the sunset and the sprinklers were running.
I remiss, onto the beer: Rich chocolate and spice aromas on the nose; brown head. Taste also is in waves of rich chocolate, spices and rich dark malt character. Sweet, slightly spicy, reminds me a bit of autumn. A bit bitter mostly from chocolate and possibly from hops, residual and up front. Finishes smooth almost like sweet chocolate milk. Cannot wait to try this again, hopefully even a barrel aged variant. 633 charactersfriendofbeer, Jun 04, 2014

Pours a deep, dark black, with a cinnamon-colored orange-ish red head, one inches, awesome color. There's a little bit of lacing down the glass.
Smells like roasted malt, chocolate, and cinnamon, with only a small amount of pepper.
The pepper is stronger in the taste for sure, and quite tasty. There's a ton of sweet, rich chocolate, a little bit of spicy cinnamon, and lots of roasted malt. The flavors meld together really well. This is just another great example of the "Mexican chocolate" style of stout.
Thick, viscous body, coats the mouth with goodness. Very drinkable, because of how well the flavors meld together. Low amount of carbonation.
Just a real treat and pleasure to drink this one, it's so decadent and complex. 776 charactersGreesyFizeek, Jun 02, 2014

4.5/5  rDev +1.1%I initially gave this a tick drinking at the tap room at LP Binny's, but the beer took FOREVER to warm up (air conditioning is real there!), so I finally got a bottle myself, and am giving this another shot.
The beer pours an awesome head for a stout this heavy; nice brown foam and really oily lacing. Great looking beer. The smell itself is pretty coffee-heavy, with not too much else too it (at least that I got). 
The taste of the beer is extremely coffee-forward when you first start drinking (especially if the beer hasn't warmed); I can only imagine what Coffee Abraxas tastes like. The chile heat is always present as a faint acidic aftertaste, but as the beer warms, it becomes sweeter and you get more of a cinnamon presence (not a cinnamon bomb by any means, though). 
I'm not a huge fan of coffee-forward beers, which generally means that bitter, cacao-forward stouts aren't my favorite. I didn't love the coffee-like taste of this, but the beer itself is complex and really interesting, so much so that I was willing to blow through the entire bottle in one sitting. It reminds me of a more-balanced, sweeter version of Xocoveza in many ways, which is definitely a compliment (since Xocoveza was excellent, and I would've enjoyed it even more if it were sweeter and less hot). 
I first had this and the Abyss around the same time, and while both give you a lot of coffee at the beginning, the other components of Abraxas were what made me come back and give Abraxas a second shot. Excellent, and right up there with BCBCS as the best coffee-forward stouts I've ever had. 1,587 charactersSeanBond, May 23, 2014

4.74/5  rDev +6.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Appearance - The beer was a dark black color, looking like used motor oil. A slight mocha head topped the glass.
Smell - The aroma I detected was almost a syrupy coffee smell. The sweetness in the aroma was almost overwhelming.
Taste - This is heavy. Initially, I am led to believe this will be sweet like molasses. Then, I notice cinnamon, vanilla, and a hint of pepper. The malts give the impression of coffee, but it is not overwhelming. The warming in the aftertaste is mild, but it is the thick sweetness that gives the biggest impression.
Mouthfeel - This is thick and coats the tongue and throat. It leaves an impression well after the swallow.
Overall - I liked this one a lot. This is a fantastic stout. 716 charactersJohnnyHopps, Apr 27, 2014

Bottle from 11/2013
a one of the more attractive stouts, rich and sludgy with a great shine. Nice dark brown head that hangs a minute and streaky lacing on the glass.
s all the goodies. Cinnamon chocolate roasted coffee, really nice balance. Small hints of the heat
t takes the pass from the nose and slam dunk. All the flavors in perfect harmony. Rich chocolate with a glazing of cinnamon and a dash of spice. Really nice.
m great full body. Lush and rich. Big and unapologetic, but oh so silky and easy to destroy the entire bottle on my own.
o overall this is a hunah killer. I am not usually a fan of spicy beers and this beer, right now 6 months post bottle is just perfect. I have had this beer a few times and this is probably my favorite experience with it. Really just fantastic 941 characterscosmicevan, Apr 26, 2014

A: Pours very smooth and slowly, just like motor oil. Appears a deep inky black with a finger of caramel-colored head.
S: Slight booziness. Roasted malt, coffee, vanilla, cinnamon, molasses, and just faintly of chili peppers. 
T: Damn, the richness smacks you in the face. Pretty sweet, not cloying, but a tad much for my tastes. The first thing I get is lots of cinnamon and vanilla. Next is chili pepper, accompanied by the slight burn. There is a bit of roasted coffee presence as well. All in all, nice, but gets a tad overwhelming, like drinking a sweet cinnamon cookie. It does get better as it warms.
M: Definitely the thickest beer I've ever had. It's like drinking eggnog. Coats the entire mouth and just sticks there. Some might call it 'chewy'. Very smooth and creamy. No carbonation comes through in a beer this heavy. Couldn't ask for more in an Imperial Stout.
O: As I mentioned, it's like drinking a cookie. Quite sweet, which can get overwhelming as you get further into the bottle. Good complexity of flavor, not as much chili pepper as others I've had. Definitely a bottle you want someone to share with. Someday I hope to the opportunity to try the BA version. 1,226 charactersd5001986, Apr 13, 2014

Aroma of massive chocolates, a hint of spicy pepper, and a bit of cinnamon. Really nice. Flavor is super sweet chocolate, light roast, a bit of cinnamon dryness, with a lingering dry cocoa powder and light chile flavor left on the palate. The heat picks up a tad as I sip and the cinnamon definitely comes out as it warms. Thick bodied with low carbonation, but not as thick as I was expecting after watching the pour. Pretty good stuff with both sweet chocolate and bitter roast shining through here. Hoping to find the BA version someday. 651 charactersBMMillsy, Apr 13, 2014

The beer is black and viscous with an oily beige collar. Aromas of heavy cinnamon with some peppery heat. Vanilla and chocolate are there as well, but in the background a bit. Really nice flavor, with cinnamon leading the way. Rich, roasted malt with hints of coffee. Thick body with a delicate sweetness throughout. While Hunahpu's still reigns supreme, in my opinion, Abraxas is certainly a delicious and well crafted beer well worth seeking out. 489 charactersHuhzubendah, Apr 01, 2014

A - Dark as night poured syrupy into a snifter with decent lacing and a khaki tan foam head
S - Cinnamon, Chile, Cocoa, Vanilla, Coffee all come through as it warms
T - Taste is a an overpowering cinnamon and chile taste with not enough chocolate and vanilla in my opinion. Not as good as I was expecting from this.
M - Mouthfeel was a medium to full bodied creamy smooth chewy taste. 
O - I was underwhelmed drinking this as Perennial is local for me. Was expecting much more chocolate vanilla coffee rather than an overpowering cinnamon taste. The cinnamon is just not for me although
Re-Review --> Had this on draft for the first time as I avoided it on draft the previous three times I had seen it. Revisited it this week and really enjoyed it this time. Not sure if my bottle was overloaded with cinnamon or my palate was screwed up, but I enjoyed 25 ounces this time much more than I did when I had 6 ounces. Still loads of cinnamon but this was zoo much more balanced between the chocolate cinnamon chile vanilla and coffee.. Smell and appearance can stay the same but overall. from 4 taste to 4.5 and overall from 4.25 to 4.5
2014 Abraxas
Much more balance between the adjuncts this year. Slightly more pepper taste on the finish. Great balance between the chocolate cinnamon vanilla. Better than 2012 and 2013. Definitely my favorite year thus far 1,433 charactersdrmcleod10, Mar 19, 2014

Dark black, tan head, looks good. Aroma is cinnamon and the slightest hint of pepper. Flavor seemed heavier on the cinnamon with discernible vanilla, not much pepper on the flavor. My friend said it reminded her of cinnamon life cereal. I liked this beer but I could never pay $20 for a 750, more like $10. 442 charactersArrogantB, Mar 10, 2014

Very dark with a big dense mocha head and some pretty spatter.
Nice chile presence on the nose mixed with vanilla. Underneath sits a nice dark chocolate and cinnamon. 
My first impression was that this beer lacked boldness. After a few sips, and remembering the big flavors in Mexican Cake that really didn't do much for me, I saw this more as well integrated. Each successive sip grew on me. Chiles ride atop the adjuncts harmoniously. Flavors integrate seamlessly without clashing. Alcohol is masterfully hidden; this is dangerously drinkable. So many different aspects working well together.
Body is the only flaw as this comes off a bit thin and light on the tongue.
Overall, what a really well done stout. Takes Mexican Cake and Hunahpu's behind the woodshed. 860 charactersBarrytheBear, Mar 09, 2014

S- Cinnamon is quite apparent. Vanilla, booze, sweet fruits and lots of charred caramel.

M- Thick, full body, with moderate booze. Creamy as can be.
O- Wow. Not the spice that Bomb has, but an outstanding food beer. Pair with steak, lamb, or even duck. Any coffee style desert would work nicely too.

4.53/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Poured into stemmed glass. 3 month old.
Pours a deep inky black, viscous, with a compact cappuccino colored head that lingers around and leaves huge lacing.
Aroma is a brilliant milk chocolate, churros, creamed honey, vanilla, and a distant roaster note not quite coffee but close. This smells chewy and decadent!
On the palate the ancho chiles finally make their appearance. But very well integrated with rest of the flavors. More of that milk chocolate, major fresh cinnamon stick, latte, orange liqueur, vanilla, and the undeniable spicy ancho. Leaves some heat on the back of the throat and high chest area. 
Mouthfeel is thick, slick, and voluptuous. Heavy body with ample carbonation for an impy stout. Just wonderful.
Overall, expertly crafted over at Perrenial. Love the milk chocolatey base flavor all the others play off of. Even though there was no vanilla brewed into this you get major vanilla notes which I really enjoy. A dessert beer, and one that should definitely be shared as I think a 750 will be hard to manage by myself! Would love to try the coffee version. 1,085 charactersMarcWP, Feb 22, 2014

But I digress, was anticipating this one, even though it isn't the barrel-aged version.
A: maybe deserves a 5, but detracted for minimal to no lacing. Otherwise the dark to black pour had a decent initial dark tan head.
S/T: I combine these because the initial taste followed the smell almost to a tee. The smell was decently sweet with a strong mocha presence. (Edit: the chili comes through quite prevalent and satisfyingly.  The taste consumes the mouth with the toasted malt, followed quickly with a bitter, dark chocolate flavor. The chiles combine with the cocoa in a very interesting way.  
Edit: my initial review I didn't get much chile, in my re-review, it couldn't be avoided.
M: The body is full, as each drink seems to be able to hit senses in every part if my mouth.  Feel is silky at first, turning a bit oily in the end.
O: very good, if a little on the sweet side.  My initial tastes made me think of Imperial Biscotti Break, but not quite to that standard. I'm interested in the feel, more as an intriguing point than a purely satisfying point. 1,125 characterscjgiant, Feb 15, 2014

Picked up in a trade from Maryland. Poured into a small Stone branded snifter.
Pours viscous dark black with a thin tan head that dissipates after a few sips, nice lacing from start to finish. Nose is earthy and peppery, plum and toasted malt, sweet chocolate, black liquorish. The taste is absolutely phenomenal - similar to the nose, very earthy, dark toasted malt, raisin, bitter dark chocolate and as it warms up a bit the cinnamon and chilies really come through, with a little warmth on the back end from the high ABV. A lot going on, but in perfect harmony - extremely well balanced flavors. The mouthfeel is perfect for the style - big bodied, creamy, moderate carbonation, finishes extremely dry. 
Such a good Imperial Stout. 757 charactersDeanMoriarty, Jan 26, 2014

A: Jet black with an inch of tan head that dissipates after a min to a subtle 1/4 inch tan foam.
S: The noise of this beer is very complex. Cocoa, peppers, a mild coffee, spicy, cinnamon, and a strong nutmeg smell. This smell reminds me of going home to my parents house for christmas, with my moms christmas yankee candles lit and a banana nutbread in the oven.
T: The taste is outrageously spicy on the front end, while subtle on the back end. The back end leaves you with a bit of heat. You can definitely taste the cacao nibs and ancho chili peppers. This beer at the front punches you with cinnamon and then leaves you with the heat of the ancho chili peppers.
M: The feel of this beer is creamy, thick and almost chewy.
O: Overall this is an incredibly enjoyable beer. This beer tastes distinctively different than alot of other imperial stouts. While a lot of other breweries try to spice their imperial stouts with different things, it either A: doesn't work, or B:gets lost behind the chocolate and coffee tastes that are normally prevalent in imperial stouts, or C: is overpowering with one individual spice. But this beer does not fall into those categories. It is complex yet enjoyable. The ancho chili peppers, cinnamon sticks, and cacao nibs are very prevalent but enjoyable. This beer is a success in its uniqueness 1,382 charactersKCBeerNerd, Jan 22, 2014

The aroma has that cocoa nib, tons of cinnamon and spices. Chocolate and a hint of that chili throughout. Lots of fruity spice.
The flavor follows with a medium chocolate sweetness, then vanilla, and then the cinnamon and spices are some of the biggest flavors. The chili is really subtle and gives a bit of spice, but more gentle warming. Fruity spice and caramel dominate throughout, along with the cinnamon.
A very balanced brew that stands in behind Mexican Cake and ahead of Hunahpu in the style. 566 charactersdar482, Jan 22, 2014

4.13/5  rDev -7.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4Poured a dark brown, almost black body with one finger dark brown head (so I guess the body is black since I differentiate) that left lace patches and had an aroma of sweetness like chocolate and toffee, maybe caramel, hint of cinnamon, and some roasted, bready malts as well as coffee and chile (although I may pick these up more b/c others say they are in there than on my own without prior knowledge). A thick, almost chewey body that is sticky at times but so easy to drink and so calling for me to drink it. Great balance as I get a lot of chocolate and touches of cinnamon (and I still think toffee or caramel) with a very dry, coffee-esque malt base. Picks up on the end with a little heat so I'm assuming both the alcohol and chile are coming in and thankfully not overpowering me at all. A very enjoyable sipper and another great beer from Perennial. 859 charactersclayrock81, Jan 17, 2014

Tribes Alehouse - Tinley Park, IL
A black hole of a liquid is set in front of me in a tiny little snifter. A dense mocha head rests on top of the body with an almost purple tint. Tiny carbonation bubbles crawl up the glass to keep the head intact throughout the entire drink while sheet lacing gets left behind. This is one handsome stout.
The nose is intense but well integrated. A big hit of cocoa kicks things off before slightly smokey, earthy ancho joins the fray. Subtle vanilla and baking spices (cinnamon mostly) lay across the top of coffee, chocolate malts, doughiness and moderate roast to make for an appetizing nose.
Robust cocoa again leads the way. Vanilla, cinnamon, and earthy ancho bring about thoughts of a holiday cookies. The ancho also lends a touch of leathery smokiness. All those attributes are wrapped around coffee, chocolate malt, and an approachable roast. Nice depth and complexity.
The body is silky but robust. Smooth but sticky. As a matter of fact my only complaint about this beer is that it's slightly stickier than I would have liked but that's minor. The weight is on the higher side of the spectrum while the feel remains creamy.
The depth alone makes this a beer worth seeking out. I've always been a sucker for the Mexican style stouts and Abraxas is no exception. The ancho works well with cocoa, vanilla, and cinnamon for an alcoholic, dense Mexican style hot chocolate of sorts. 1,439 charactersjoe1510, Jan 11, 2014

Aroma: Chili peppers, dark chocolate roasted malts, cinnamon, and some vanilla. The chili peppers and cinnamon spice dominate the front of the palate. It is backed by a massive roasted dark chocolate flavor and slight warming from the alcohol. The vanilla flavor is very subtle but melds quite well with the rest of the beer. Also notable is a slight gingerbread flavor.
I will remember this as an extremely rich full bodied beer that is dominated by cinnamon. The chili peppers are quite muted in terms of heat but make this beer what it is. 683 charactersmnphish, Jan 06, 2014

A: Viscous pour. Dense, dark black. No light, just shiny onyx in the glass. Mellow pour brings a very slow developing caramel head. Does a nitro-esque 'fall' settling on 1/2" lingering head. Chunky, think lacy throughout. Really nice looking beer.
S: Ancho very present at the front. Layer in dark roast coffee. Wisps of cinnamon punch in at the tail. Almost smoky edge to it, some sweeter notes as well.
T: Creamy, mildly spicy-sweet. Complex yet smooth. Little to no roasted astringency. Chiles play nicely against the cinnamon to sort of fill that role. Some tannin, more tea than coffee. This mixed with the chile and cinnamon call to mind a chai latte, only way better. Cocoa rises as it warms, becoming a little like a nice Mexican chocolate. Some slight bits of dark fruits, dates. Super complex array of flavors.
M: Full bodied. Smooth, silky, mouth coating. Not cloying, stickiness soothes the spice.
O: Very impressive mix of flavors. The texture is brilliant, but the complexity of the flavors is just really well done. Part of me wishes for a little more roast, thinking it could back off the sweetness a bit, but I think letting the chiles and cinnamon do that is just fine. Glad a snagged a bottle. Head and shoulders the best Perennial I've tried. Now if I could only snag the barrel aged... 1,355 charactersBraseltonage, Jan 04, 2014

4.72/5  rDev +6.1%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Enjoyed on tap for Bier Station's one year anniversary Midwest tap takeover event. They had both the 2012 and the 2013 on tap, so it was really fun to do a mini-vertical and compare the beer to itself after a year. The scores and review will be for the 2013 (fresh) vintage, but I will make reference to the 2012 as well. Both were served in small Belgian tulip glasses.
Appearance - Yields a healthy two finger head mocha tan head of bubbles so small it looked a bit like chocolate mousse. The body beneath is a pitch black with zero light penetrating, not even around the edges of the glass. The dense head helps keep out the light as well. Retention is moderate, and the head dissipates to a rim of foam around the edge of the glass with a mottling of film across the surface. Lacing is spotty and very sparse. The 2012 is different in that it has much less head at first pour, starting out with a lazy half-finger foam that dissipates almost immediately. It also happens to have more legs than the 2013, with the foam leaving a sheet across the side of the glass when I tilt it, but it slinks back down, leaving zero lacing.
Smell - Rich with notes of cinnamon stick, dried chile, melting baker's chocolate and molasses. I also get a nice element of char from the roasted malt that you expect from a stout or porter. The aroma is so aggressive, with cinnamon and chile being front and center. The 2012, by contrast, has mellowed way out on the cinnamon and chile, allowing the rich, decadent notes of bittersweet chocolate to shine through. I think I prefer the fresh, although if I had never had it fresh, the one-year version would be an outstanding beer in it's own rite.
Taste - Like with the aroma, the cinnamon and chile work together to provide quite a punch to start. Spiced devil's food cake with an invigorating burn from the spice that is kept relatively in-check by the rich bittersweet element from the roasted malt and burnt caramel. The heat lingers for a long time, but it's a pleasant heat. Would be the perfect beer for a cold night. The 2012 vintage has mellowed considerably, with the cinnamon becoming a mere accent to the rich chocolatey taste and the pepper becoming a gentle tingle instead of the noticeable heat. Here, I think I prefer the 2012, but only by a shade. I still think the 2013 is unmatched for the right situation--when you want a big stout with some aggressive character.
Mouthfeel - Full-bodied, rich and creamy. Luscious. Carbonation is moderate and the finish is lingering and coats the mouth to a degree. The 2012 is a tiny bit thinner, but still nice and creamy. Lower carbonation levels are to be expected as well.
Overall, this is just a top-notch offering from Perennial. Outstanding and unique as a fresh beer, and wonderfully age-able as well. I've not had many different beers from this "Spiced Imperial Stout" sub-style that has been popular, but this one is fantastic. Now I just need to get my hands on the BA version... 2,982 charactersLambicPentameter, Dec 30, 2013

The taste is chocolate with a tail end of pepper. The mouth feel is very smooth. Having it side by side with Darkness the mouth feel is a bit thinner.

The aroma is sweet fudgy chocolate with some cinnamon and spice. Kind of smells like a Mexican mocha. Alcohol comes out as it warms.
The flavor is sweet fudgy lactic chocolate with some cinnamon and spicy chili with a bitter roast finish and some booze and black licorice. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and creamy.
Overall, very interesting with a lot going on. Everything doesn't blend real well - the chocolate is a bit too sweet, the roast is a bit too bitter, the black licorice is a bit strong. It would be interesting to try this aged to see if it mellows some. It is a bit pricey at $22 a bottle. 714 charactersBeaver13, Dec 23, 2013

Reviewed live. Expectations are high given its reputation and current 96 rating. 10% ABV confirmed per the label. Reviewed as a chili imperial stout. 
Served cold - straight from the fridge - and allowed to warm over the course of consumption. Side-poured with standard vigor as no carbonation issues are anticipated. 
A: No bubble show forms as it's poured. 
Pours a gorgeous rich dark tan colour head of one finger width. Fantastic creaminess and thickness. Beautifully soft shiny complexion. Lovely even consistency. The head is wonderful, but recedes inside two minutes - likely due to the high ABV. No real lacing clings to the sides of the glass as the head recedes, nor can I get any to stick by tilting the glass. 
Body colour is a predictable opaque solid jet black. No floating yeast particles or sediment is visible. 
Overall, it's a gorgeous looking stout with an impressive head. I'd call it a special appearance, but it isn't unique. There are no flaws here 
Sm: Hidden roast, heavy cacao nib dust, chocolate malts, dark malts, dusty powdered chilis (but no overt spice or heat), rich cinnamon dust, and cream. Some burnt/caramelized sugars. 
Really appealing. 
The cinnamon obscures the chilis, but overall I'm really impressed. A mouthwatering aroma of mild strength. I can't wait to try it. 
No yeast character, hop character, or overt alcohol is detectable.
T: Dark malts, cocoa powder/dust, chocolate malts, milk chocolate, caramel, caramelized/burnt sugars, well-integrated cinnamon spice, a faint hint of chili heat, brown/muscavado sugar, and cream. Cocoa dust is dominant, and boy is that note executed well here. A bit ashy and burnt. Any vanilla is pretty tame, and doesn't evoke authentic vanilla bean (or artificial vanillicin). 
Very well balanced, though there isn't a great deal of complexity (relative to the style) or subtlety. It isn't an intricate brew, but the subtle chili pepper lends it some interesting nuance and the cinnamon is a nice touch. 
Above average depth of flavour. Average duration and intensity of flavour. Very cohesive, but not quite gestalt. 
Mf: Creamy, smooth, and wet. Thick and full-bodied. Unrefreshing. Really good presence on the palate. Comforting, approachable, and somewhat soft. A biteen overcarbonated. 
Not too sticky. 
Not oily, gushed, hot, boozy, astringent, or harsh.
Dr: Drinkable for the 10% ABV, but the ABV isn't that well hidden. I quite like it, and I'd certainly order it again at a bar, but I don't know that it's world class. It's almost a unique take on an imperial stout, and I love the subtlety of the chili pepper. I'll have to try more beers from Perennial. This one is damn solid. 
The mouthfeel is a highlight for me, but the earthiness of the flavour profile detracts from the beer overall.

Whoa. The aroma is godly. Tons of cinnamon roasted espresso. Burnt faint peppered caramel on the nose. Deep dark chocolate, roasty & toasty. 
This is just fantastic. Dry, roasty, high bitterness, even smooth carbonation that's high and fitting. Sweetness is nice and dark chocolate upfront and slowly fades to bitter espresso coffee beans. Flavor lasts and lasts. Creamy, chewy, oaty, full bodied, roasty, delicious. The Ancho is very faint and not prevalent, just as it should. 
Magic. Highly drinkable due to well placed dry bitterness and branded sweetness. Kick ass beer! A definite sipper... I can't wait to try Abraxas later down the road. Highly recommended!!! 876 characterschugalug06, Dec 14, 2013

A: The beer is jet black in color. It poured with a quarter finger high tan head that died down and left a collar around the edge of the glass and lacing down the sides.
S: Moderate aromas of cocoa nibs are present in the nose along with strong notes of cinnamon and hints of ancho chilies.
T: The taste is similar to the smell but is much more balanced and complex with flavors of ancho chilies, vanilla beans and cocoa nibs along with notes of cinnamon.
M: It feels medium- to full-bodied, thick and creamy (slightly fudgy) on the palate with a moderate amount of carbonation.
O: This beer has an excellent balance as you can taste all of the flavors in perfect proportions. 713 charactersmetter98, Dec 06, 2013

A- Dense, thick, and black in the glass. Pretty sizable collar of thick, chocolatey brown foam. Lacing and retention are both tremendous.
S- Dark and semisweet. Hints of vanilla, and a mild hint of spiciness, I suspect a combo of the cinnamon and ancho. Awesome base of dark malts in the background of all of this.
T- Dark malts up front dominate the beginning and majority of the drink. Underlying ancho pepper profile adds just a touch of spiciness on the tongue. Vanilla is more prominent in the middle and towards the end of the drink than the pepper is. Somewhat sweet throughout, and the drink ends with its solid dark malt base flavor that lingers just a little bit.
M- Thick and creamy. Low to moderate level of carbonation. Alcohol level is undetectable in taste and feel. Drinks incredibly smooth.
Overall, this is a great beer on tap. It was served on the cold side, but as it warms, it really develops. Complex and delicious, with the vanilla and ancho flavors being really unique. 1,051 charactersboilermakerbrew, Dec 04, 2013

Pours a pitch black body, like the dark of night. Comes with a nice fluffy tan head, good retention. Not much lacing. Looks like any other imperial stout, though the head is exceptionally great-looking.
Smells like cinnamon toast crunch cereal to me. I love CTC as its my favorite cereal, so this is a true treat. Some dark chocolate fudge in the back, not much pepper or chiles in the nose. All that cinnamon is amazing, I could smell it forever.. but I want to drink this beer now.
Not as much cinnamon on the palate as in the nose. Here, the chiles take over the stage, complemented by the cinnamon and the bitter dark chocolate flavours. Some sweet milk chocolate as well. Rather sweet palate on this beer, but the chiles and chocolate help balance that out some. The chiles leave a nice but not overwhelming burn on the back end of the palate.
Full bodied, solid carbonation. Not super creamy, but it goes down very smoothly. Not much alcohol burn to speak of, its the chiles' burn that gets ya. Still, its a bit of a sipper because of how intensely flavourful it is.. you just want to savor it on a cold night. 
Very interesting beer, its up there with Hunahpu in terms of how this Mexican style stout is executed. I'd love to try Mexican Cake and Prairie Bomb alongside this and Hunahpu to compare, but I suspect that this might win them all for me because I really, really loved Cinnamon Toast Crunch as a kid. So it may not be fair.
Re-reviewed today, 11/2/2013. Picked a relatively fresh 2013 batch- probably a month old at this point total. Poured into a Hill Farmstead stemmed glass.
Basically this is what I remember it being when the 2012 bottling was about 6 months old. So much cinnamon that comes out even more as the beer gets warmer. I would definitely recommend drinking this at closer to cellar or room temperature rather than chilled. The chili peppers are there in a slightly vegetal manner, with some spiciness on the back end- not a lot like Mexican Cake, but just enough to complement the base imperial stout and the cinnamon. This is easily my favorite Mexican style stout by far, having had Hunahpu and Mexican Cake already. And I will definitely attest to the fact that BA Abraxas is just that much better- just add in a lot of vanilla bourbon marshmallows to this and that's what you got. 2,450 charactersStevedore, Dec 03, 2013

A - Not quite black coloring, but a super dark body with semi-dark toffee head. Quite frothy but minimal retention and lacing. Slightly filmy across the sides.
S - Plentiful dark cocoa. Cinnamon, caramelized brown sugar, and almost lactose-like. It really smells like a Starbucks mocha latte.
T - Dry, deeply roasted espresso. Strong, strong dark chocolate. I maybe sense a hint of the pepper skins but this has aged a few months and it's very minimal by now.
M - Medium-heavy body, very dry. Low carbonation, long bitter finish.
D - I can see why this is a great base for a barrel treatment. It's pretty similar to Hunahpu's but doesn't have anywhere near the same heftyness to it. 828 charactersAuracom, Dec 02, 2013

A very thin but quite dark mocha bubbled collar tries to make a head, but quickly dissolves with an oily slick and slimey top. Collar manage to maintain light tan, and good staying power. Body color is super dark walnut black and has a bit of sludgey looking consistency.
Real nice nose of, mild chilis, and a good sense of some soft fruits. Hints of banana sotness and light charring roasty malts. Hints of milky chocolate but fairly tiny, but has a real nice banana split like action dusted with cayenne.
Deep warming heated chili, with lots of coffee like finishing aftertaste. Silky roast malts and malted sensing chocolate, which hints a kind of wafer crispy bitterness. First sip has a nice prickly carbonation that really matches the cinnamon hotness that matches nicely with the chili action. Heat seems to be more on the cinnamon side, and very lightly dry sweetness that balances with roast and yeast playful bitterness/sourness. Very light bodied for a big stout also.
OVerall a pretty fun beer, definitely one of the more fun chili beers I've had as well. 1,116 characterssmakawhat, Nov 30, 2013

About a finger of dark mocha head rests on top of a really dark and thick body. It's almost black, but also hard to tell because the lighting was so poor in the bar.
Aromas of coffee and dark chocolate; not terribly rich or overpowering.
Wonderful balance of coffee and chocolate with an added element of powder cinnamon, which intensifies as the beer warms. Everything is a bit bitter.
Amazing feel, thick and subsantative, smooth and drinkable. Dry.
Overall incredible stout; balanced and highly enjoyable. 598 charactersrodlavers, Nov 23, 2013

Dark Chocolate, chilies, cinnamon, wood, and some vanilla notes dominate the nose. The flavor profile matches the nose with the dark chocolate most noticeable and a nice lingering burn from the chilies and spices on the finish. Cinnamon and spices become more noticeable as it warms up. This beer reminds me so much of Cigar City’s most sought after Hunaphu beers which is why I enjoyed this beer! 451 charactersCuriousMonk, Nov 19, 2013

A- Pours deep black with medium brown head, quickly fades
S- Primarily Cocao with some spice, but mostly dark chocolate
T - Follows the nose, dominated by dark chocolate. Not sure if the bottle being a year old killed the spice and heat, but neither of these were present
M- Very smooth, low carbonation, coats very well
O - This drinks very easily for 10%. Almost no carbonation so it goes down quick. I could see myself drinking a bottle of this for either breakfast or dessert, really tasty 541 characterslangchops, Nov 01, 2013

T- Somewhat creamy chocolate, some biting spice and a good amount of cinnamon. Some graham cracker in there. 
M- Kinda light here, which is the downfall for this batch. Minimal carb, kinda creamy. Great all around beer though here!

Lost Abbey TEKU
A: Pitch black. No light gets through. Looks pretty thick, but having side by side with Hunahpu it's not as thick as that. Alcohol feet. Some dark tan bits of lacing.
S: Lots of cinnamon here. Roast notes. Dark chocolate fudge. Herbal spiciness. 
T: I hope you like cinnamon, which normally I do. This was almost like a dark winter warmer to me. The spice bill completely dominates the beer. I wish that the chocolate and the roast and the fudge/vanilla were played up more. Big beer. Round sip. Lingering spice on the end of the palate.
M: Full bodied. 591 charactersinlimbo77, Oct 15, 2013

The beer pours jet black with a thin dark tan was that fizzles into a thin halo with little lacing (slightly oily residue) and no sediment. The nose is marshmallow-vanilla, chilies, and some bitter cocoa on the back end. It's not potently aromatic, but all the different notes come through in time. The taste is sweet and marshmallowy upfront, but there is much more distinct cocoa compared to the nose. It's full bodied, lightly carbonated, has rich and distinct flavors, masked alcohol, and a slight heat from the chilies in the finish. This is a fantastic stout, with a rich, full body, bold adjuncts, and seductive drinkability 653 charactersThePorterSorter, Sep 30, 2013

Appearance. Pours thick and black with over two fingers of dark tan head, great retention.
Smell. Cinnamon and sweet dark chocolate, some vanilla and a light herbal, almost peppermint like smell that must be at least partially from the chillies.
Taste. Dark dark chocolate and woody cinnamon, with a nice herbal spiciness that lingers a while. 
Mouthfeel. Full body, slightly sticky, low carbonation.
Overall. A nice big stout with lots of herbal spice going on. I don't understand the hype on this one, but a good brew for sure. 569 charactersRutager, Sep 18, 2013

A - Beautiful, dark, very black, what one can expect from a proper Imperial Stout
S - Smells like a well made imperial stout, with the adjuncts they brewed with, and this is a fantastic thing. Dark, roasted notes, with a bit of coffee, chocolate, and Cinnamon, with a bit of heat coming form the chillies.
T - Sipping on the brew, you get a perfect amount of chocolate and roasted notes, with a bit of Cinnamon, and then at the end the bit of spice hits you, and it all melds together into beer perfection. Sipping on this beer at a reasonable rate, the heat of the chillies seems to stick in your palette, but at a fantastic level, and it does not overpower the rest of the flavors of the beer either. Just an amazing balance of chillies, chocolate, and Cinnamon.
M - Usual Imperial stout affair, very smooth and velvety on the palette, as one would expect.
O - One of the greatest beers I have ever had. I do like spice quite a bit, and as such this is a perfect beer for me. Well worth the price of entry. Cheers! 1,071 charactersMgm54, Aug 25, 2013

Pours black and thick, with half a finger of deep brown-tan head. Good retention, good lacing. Nice.
Smell is full of all kinds of spice and variety. I get cinnamon first, then vanilla, with a pinch of smoky chili pepper. Behind all that is a robust, sweet stout with chocolate and molasses. Excellent, and reminds me a lot of some of the Deschutes anniversary beers (e.g. BB XIII).
Taste is more dominated by one element, specifically the chili, which comes on bright and red early and maintains a steady burn. The sweetness and chocolate settle in below it, but the subtle spices and additions that were so delightful in the nose get bowled over by the zap, zing, and swizz. A little less pepper, please. But still quite tasty.
Thick and chewy, though not as heavy as I was anticipating. Medium-low carbonation, fits the beer well.
A really interesting stout, with some fabulous things going on in the smell. Unfortunately, they're mostly overpowered in the taste by a few dominant characteristics. But all around, it's really good, and quite different from most big stouts I've had (save the Deschutes BB anniversary series I already mentioned). 1,243 characterszeledonia, Jun 28, 2013

Looks great coming out of the bottle. Good color and nice tan head.
Smell isn't quite what I was expecting. Not much stout aroma, heavy on the pepper and cinnamon.
Taste - Starts out with heavy pepper, some cinnamon, and a touch of cocoa. Sounds great in writing, not so good in actuality. The pepper and cinnamon flavors were unpleasant, and there was not enough balance between the stout and the additions. No heat from the peppers comes through, also no vanilla that I could detect.
Mouthfeel is fine.
Overall, I was incredibly disappointed with this beer. It seems this has to do with my palate as opposed to getting a bad bottle, as the other tasting group members all really enjoyed it. I couldn't even finish my 4 oz taster of this. I did really enjoy Hunahpu, so I'm not sure why Abraxas didn't work for me, but it's not a beer I would seek to drink again. 938 charactersthebigredone, Jun 22, 2013
4.52/5  rDev +1.6%look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.752012 vintage into a Brooklyn Brewery snifter. Shared with schen9303. 
Pours pitch black with a dark, fluffy mocha colored head with good retention. Beer is pitch black. Lacing is thick but sparse with oily legs. Real menacing look brew.
Nose is mint, chocolate, fudge, and cocoa. Vanilla beans smooth out the experience while a touch of spice tickles the nose. Very deep and rich. Moderately aromatic. Solid.
Opens cocoa, cinnamon spice, chocolate, and fudge. Vanilla beans add even more sweetness towards the middle. Some heat comes in towards the end amidst more fudge and milk and dark chocolate sweetness. Chili peppers in the end with a heated, sweet, cinnamon finish. Great complexity, very unique, and really well integrated. 
Full bodied with moderate carbonation. Oily, slick, and rich in the mouth and goes down messy, smooth, and thick. Messy finish with a sticky, lingering aftertaste. Couldn't ask for more.
I haven't been a fan of a lot of Perennial's beers and in fact, I feel they're a bit over-rated overall. However, Abraxas is a revelation. The flavor has great balance and complexity, the feel is incredible, and the look and nose are spot on. I wish I'd picked up a lot more of these when I had the chance. 1,232 charactersSpeedwayJim, Jun 19, 2013

Pours black big dark brown head that holds for a little bit, then slowly fades to nothing. This gets overused, but it looked like I was pouring motor oil into a tulip.
Chocolate, vanilla and cinnamon invite the nose to dive into the glass and stay for a while. A little heat from the alcohol and chiles are present, but not overwhelming.
At the beginning of each sip, rich chocolatey goodness is what I got, followed by vanilla and cinnamon at the end. I know those damn chiles were messing around somewhere, but they showed up here and there, only for a positive contribution.
Thick and velvety smooth, exactly what I want in an imperial stout. Not much carbonation.
This one exceeded all of my hopes and expectations by so far. It definitely lives up to the hype it recieves and is worth trying hard to seek out. Could be a candidate for my favorite imperial stout. I loved it! 1,032 charactersCvescalante, May 29, 2013

Smell: Chocolate, coffee, chile and cinnamon aromas all waft upwards from the beer 
Taste: Chocolate and coffee flavors dominate the front end with cinnamon appearing in the middle; after the swallow, heat from the chile peppers hits the taste buds though the lasting impression, in the finish, is from the cinnamon
Mouthfeel: Medium to full body with moderate carbonation
Overall: Really nice and complex flavors though the cinnamon is a bit too strong in the finish; still, a keeper 615 charactersbrentk56, May 27, 2013

4.25/5  rDev -4.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25From 05/15/13 notes. Had this on tap at Pony Bar on the UES in NYC during their one year anniversary party.
a - Pours a pitch black one color with one to two inches of dark tan head and moderate carbonation evident. Looks like a very nice big stout.
s - Smells of roasted malts, sweet milk chocolate, green peppers, cinnamon, toasted malts, vanilla, cocoa, light coffee, light sugar and molasses, and some cream. Very nice nose; super complex but nothing dominates it, which I liked a lot. Sometimes when I hear a beer is brewed with so many different ingredients I feel like you can only make out one or two of them, but this one works great; you can really smell the chocolate, vanilla, cinnamon, and peppers at different times.
t - Tastes of roasted malts, green bell peppers, cinnamon, vanilla, dark chocolate, cocoa, toasted malts, burnt malts, and molasses. Taste has a little more cinnamon and vanilla than the nose, and a lot more pepper. I didn't find it spicy at all, but for more earthy, green bell peppers from it. Very nice, though a little too much pepper taste for me; a big step down from the nose.
m - Medium to full bodied stout and low to moderate carbonation. Body is pretty smooth and not much spice or alcohol heat. Very nice body.
o - Overall I was very excited for this one and I liked it a lot. I think the nose is amazing and complex, and it looks and feels great. The taste is good, though the weak point of the beer for me, as it has a lot of peppers to it. Not a spicy chili pepper taste, but more an earthy bell pepper taste. I would see how a bourbon barrel would mute the peppers and make a very good stout into a world class stout. Would love to get a bottle of the BA version. 1,715 charactersmdfb79, May 16, 2013

A - Pours super thick and very dark brown. One of the thickest, most dense beers I've poured. Right away I was excited
S - Sweet chocolate, spices, maybe cinnamon, a little pepper
T - Lots of thick and rich chocolately malt flavors up front, followed by the spices, and finally a hint of heat from the chili peppers, but not too much. Every sip makes you want another. The alcohol is well hidden for the ABV too.
M - Thick and creamy. Like liquid fudge
O - This was one of the most enjoyable spiced imperial stouts I've had. I would love to try it next to a bottle of Hunaphu because that might be the only one that can hold a candle to Abraxas (barrel aged stouts aside...) 769 characterscnbrown313, May 10, 2013

A: This is a dark brown/black beer, head is a little lighter than I imagined solid retention and lacing.
S: A lot of chilli, coffee, chocolate, and cinnamon on the nose. Some roasty malts as well. Very pleasing.
T: Wow, chilli. Chilli presence is crazy on this beer. The cinnamon is also very present. Nice chocolatey notes add a richness to it. Roasty malts and coffee as you might imagine. Little to no booziness.
M: Sadly, the only unremarkable aspect of this beer. Its tastes and smells compete with Huna's, but the moutfeel is too thin and overcarbonated. Wet throughout but some dryness on the finish from the pepper.
O: A fantastic imperial stout that is almost as good as Huna. Perhaps the BA version of this thickens the mouthfeels and tones down the carbonation. I imagine with that, plus perhaps some barrel, vanilla, oak, and bourbon notes, this could be one of the best beers ever. Definitely would want to try the BA version of this. 1,049 charactersMCain04, Apr 17, 2013

Work the drive to St. Louis just to pick up a couple of bottles which they graciously saved the last of their batch for me. You guys are awesome. The first time I had a sip (poured from bottle) it was like drinking liquid fudge. I love my dark chocolate. The cinnamon is nicely balanced along with just the right touch of chilies. And I mean just the right touch. Doesn't linger too long, but is totally present. I can't stop sipping this beer whenever it's around. I do wish it was a little chewier in mouthfeel, though I actually really could care less because of how great a stout it is. A few more bottles aging in the cellar that I can't wait to try someday. Thank you, Perennial.
Side note, I'm part Thai, so I can't feel the heat of chili as much.. it came off mild to me, so in my tastes, it's nicely balanced. 907 characters4amepiphany, Apr 02, 2013

5: Big cinnamon and anchos smothered by chocolate, roasted malt. 
T: Taste follows the nose very well. Big cinnamon meets chiles but everything seemed to play second fiddle to the chiles and spice. It provides an initial zing or spiciness which is nice, it lingers from start to finish. It provides a nice heat which smothers the alcohol heat. The chocolate and roasted base is nice and helps keep the beer in check. This one is a little to spicey for my taste. The finish is rather creamy, spicey, sweet and decadent. 
M: Full bodied, well carbonated. The spice and heat really coats the palate providing some staying power. Awesome.
O: Good. I do prefer the BA version better because it seemed to hide the chiles a but more 865 charactersbarleywinefiend, Mar 30, 2013

Pours dark and black with a tan head. Decent retention for a beer this side and chunky lacing down the glass.
The nose is filled with cocoa, brown sugar, cinnamon, anise and a little smokiness. Roasted coffee also lingers in the background and smells just a bit like my chili.
A lot roastier in the flavor than the nose lets on. Lots of the creamy cocoa is still around, but a deep rich almost espresso like bitterness dominates the front end of this beer. Then the cinnamon and chile kicks in giving it a pleasant spicy contrast.
Full bodied beer with lots of sweet components, but the spicy does a good job of balancing those flavors. Because of this, the beer finishes semi-dry with good carbonation.
Very well balanced and well made beer. Good complexity throughout. I feel if I did not immediately contrast this with the deliciousness of the BA version, I may score it even higher. 960 charactersjmarsh123, Mar 28, 2013

4.49/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Gaining inspirations from ancient central America; the sweet, savory, and spicy taste of mole gives this 1-year cellared stout as much meldedness as it does complexity.
Starting off with a mimicry of espresso- the dark black beer has a gaze of cloudiness cast over it and hardly allows any depth of clarity. Capped by a sandy-tan steadfast head, the foam slowly collapses back into the beer until its dainty froth circles the glass in even more espresso-like fashion. Relatively low on retention, the beer speckles the glass with pockets of sticky foam.
A strong foundation of bold-roast coffee, cocoa-rich chocolates, brown sugar, molasses, and campfire roast set the tone for certain stout-like aromas. But its the peppery scent of undeniable cinnamon and the twinge of capsacin that tantalize the nose with complements of black jellybeans and mild vegetal pepper fruit that poke through the malts
Similar to its scent- the bold richness of creamy malts coat the early palate with the sweetness of burnt sugars and malted milk (milkshake). Saturated tastes of bittersweet chocolate is exacerbated with true dry cocoa additions. Just when its middle palate release light fruit and spice of grape, cherry, and aniseed; the sultry spices of pepper and cinnamon come on and extend into the finish. Warm, fruity, spicy, and roasty- the beer keeps rewarding the palate into an indefinite finish.
Undoubted is the beer's full body. The roast is wrapped around a malty center of residual sweetness, heavy cream malt, and marshmallowy carbonation. But as the beer slowly releases its sugars and carbonation, the onset of spice, warmth, and supple dryness keeps the beer developing deep within a savory and extended finish.
The Mexican inspired stout would make the Aztecs proud- as this beer has certainly earned respect among the best that today's craft beer world offers. The beer is meticulously balanced and doesn't shy away from powerful complexities in addition. It's beautiful in its recipe design, brewer execution, and courage. 2,034 charactersBEERchitect, Mar 26, 2013

Pours black with a thick two fingers of dark tan head. Nice sheets of lace where the head rested. 
Smells of rich cocoa, cinnamon, mild coffee and a light dose of those ancho chillis. Soft but inviting
Even without having ever tried this fresh, the age is evident in the taste (not at all in a bad way). Oh, so smooth blend of bittersweet dark chocolate, cinnamon, mild creamed coffee, fudge, earthy roast grains and a soft chilli pepper heat. Zero noticeable alcohol in this graceful combination. 
Creamy medium full feel with light carbonation. Rich, bittersweet cinnamon infused chocolate with subtle chilli pepper heat in the finish. 
Similar to Hunahpu or Westbrook Mexican Cake or even Clown Shoes Chocolate Sombrero but with it's own flair. Based on other reviews it seems that the ancho peppers have faded quite a bit in 16 months. Kind of a shame but I'll take the trade off in the form of this smooth cinnamon fudge treat. I'll be on the lookout for some of the 2013 batch later this year to have a go at a fresh one. 1,138 charactersThickNStout, Mar 23, 2013

A: Thick, oily black body with a nice milk chocolate-colored head.
S: Greenish pepper is most apparent, followed by cinnamon and chocolate notes. Pretty rich aroma - smells like a Mexican chocolate cake.
T: Cinnamon, bitter roasted malt, dark chocolate, some moderate pepper heat and slightly astringent vegetal pepper flavor. The pepper flavor, along with the roasted malt, gives the beer a somewhat off-putting bitterness.
M: Thick-bodied, moderate carbonation.
O: Although the spicing and base beer seem to have the potential to be really good together, the pepper flavors are throwing the beer off. I think the barrel-aged version is far superior, in part because the pepper flavor seems more subdued. 748 charactersEtan, Mar 13, 2013

My only regret from Great Taste of the Midwest 2012 is missing the Perennial booth completely. But the 2013 Great Taste is only five months away, & I plan on camping out there this year. 750ML skull-crusher split with my wife. 
Pour is appropriately dark with a slow-rising head that would be impressive, if I cared about that sort of thing. The nose is an ode to extremes: wild chiles, chocolate, sweets, undercarriage of spicing. My stomach quails a little bit. It's late enough on a school night that I'll put my brain on acid reflux alert. 
Abraxas isn't that shy kid you never knew in gym class. Pie-kaw! Right in the kisser. The chiles burn the crap off my esophagus, pulse open my cardia, sear the inner wall, & go to work on my small intestines. Wow. Takes a while to get underneath the heat, but there's chocolate, random spiciness. Big roast shows up as the beer begins to warm. But it's the chile heat that steals this show. Huge, thick, chewy. Stupid drinkable. 
Sometimes extreme beers come off as a desperate plea for help: not so here. This is a genuine work of art, with a great combo of flavors that just beg to be devoured as quickly as possible. I can't think of one reason why this isn't an elite level beer - simply excellent. 1,289 charactersmaximum12, Mar 05, 2013

Bottled in 11/2012. Poured in to snifter.
A -Deep black; thick and sludgy. The beer is so thick that it struggles to get out of the bottle. One finger of creamy medium brown head formed with excellent retention. 
S - Cocoa and chillies up front with a big roast profile and lighter cinnamon and smoke notes.
T - Bitter-sweet cocoa up front with a big roast profile that immediately gives way to some chilli heat. Mid-palate adds sweet molasses and a touch of cinnamon. A lingering heat in the finish. 
M - Full body. Thick and viscous. Light carbonation.
O - This was excellent. My only complaint is that there was a little too much heat which became a touch distracting and also overpowered the cinnamon a little bit. 762 charactersTheSevenDuffs, Feb 19, 2013

What better beer to pair with some different varieties of bacon than a peppered stout? This stuff pours a straight onyx topped by over a finger of khaki foam. The nose comprises earthy peppers, cocoa, roasted malts, and apple cider spices. The taste brings in more of the same, along with some brown sugar and cinnamon and a healthier roast. The peppers provide a steadily increasing, though always mild, heat in the back of the throat. Basically things boil down to this: cocoa-centric mole goodness! The body is a solid medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda drying finish. Overall, a damn fine pepper stout, easily superior to the ever-vaunted Hunahpu. 718 charactersTMoney2591, Feb 16, 2013

A- Pours pitch black, very thick and viscous looking, produces a very thin brown head that recedes to a wisp, leaves spotty lacing.
S- Spicy aroma of chile, cinnamon, as well as some cocoa and dark chocolate.
T- Has a center of rich, bittersweet dark chocolate, fudge, roasted grain and a hint of coffee. Especially as it warms you get flavors of cinnamon and chiles, which are mildly spicy and nicely balanced with the chocolate and roasted flavors.
M- Medium to full body, has a smooth, creamy feel.
O- An excellent chile stout, has some really delicious chocolate flavors as well as great use of chiles and cinnamon, a must-try. 694 charactersWillCarrera, Feb 05, 2013

A- Pours a viscous black oily color. A nice foamy mocha colored head forms and retains very well. Not so much lacing on this beer, but a rather leaves an oily coating on the glass.
S- Smells of rich chocolate, and I can definitely smell the chili's. Some spice notes, which is likely the cinnamon. Very nice to be able to distinctly pull out all the ingredients.
T- Much like the smell, you can really taste everything this beer has going on. Hits the mouth with a bold thick chocolatey flavor, which transitions to cinnamon and vanilla. The chili's go to work next bringing on a light peppery flavor and actually a little heat. The flavors work very well together, and are all balanced in a wonderful harmony.
M- Nice and thick without too much carbonation. While the pepper was a bit abrasive on the mouth for me, it was almost perfect.
O- Overall, this is great. Very reminiscent of Hunahpu's, but just different enough that it works. The chili is more pronounced, and it actually has some heat behind it which I don't recall with Hunahpu. I'm definitely going to pick up some more of these, despite the higher price tag. Going to need to land me a BA one as well, though I'll have to give up a kidney or something. 1,264 charactersGfunk720, Jan 27, 2013

Appearance: Black with a thick, creamy dark brown head. Head stays a good 15 minutes - phenomenal head retention for an imperial stout of this abv.
Smell: Excellent. Rich, dark chocolate, cinnamon, chipotle peppers. Intense and yet very balanced. 
Taste: Same as the smell. Dark chocolate and a nice smoky chipotle flavor up front, then cinnamon. Bittersweet finish. The heat from the chile peppers comes in on the finish and lingers for a while after the finish. The chocolate stays on the palate throughout. I'm really impressed by the depth and richness of the dark chocolate flavor. The chipotle heat is perfect too - gently warming but not overly hot. It makes its presence known without ever being overwhelming. Really just phenomenal flavor in this one.
Mouthfeel: Thick, velvety. Mild carbonation. Gentle heat lingers well after you finish a sip. There really isn't anything that this beer does extremely well.
Overall: Flat out phenomenal. Chile stouts are one of those styles that I absolutely love trying but am often disappointed with. They either have too much spice, too little spice, too little stout character, etc. This one nails every aspect. 1,209 charactersemyers, Jan 27, 2013

A: Super rich dark brown with a small espresso head. Sticky lacing.
S: Smell cinnamon right away, chocolate, spice, and some roasty notes. Very bold. 
T: Big chocolate up front. Cinnamon is also prominent with a considerable amount of the spice from the chilies. Incredibly rich, bold, and tasty. 
M: This is a thick, full-bodied treat. I personally couldn't drink more than I had. Creamy mouthfeel and smooth. 
O: One of the most interesting beers I've had the opportunity to try. The advertised chocolate, cinnamon, and chili are all very easy to pick up on and meld well together. A great take on the style. 672 charactersmfavoino, Jan 26, 2013

Abraxas pours dark and rich as you would expect with a great bronze head. Once poured one can immediately start sniffing hints of vanilla bean and cocoa nibs. The taste is complex. I like to think of the taste of this beer like going to a Yonder Mountain String Band concert. The band plays together beautifully, but when each band member has a chance to solo you can really hear each component. The same is true for Abraxas. A taste of Abraxas develops in stages. At first it is a chocolate but as it warms up you experience more vanilla/espresso taste, but cold/warm it finishes with a chili spice and cinnamon perfection. 682 charactersT-Leb, Jan 21, 2013
4.91/5  rDev +10.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Had to take the time to post a full review of this special beer. This was an unexpected blow your mind beer. First I need to give a huge tip of the cap to Alex (Masterski) for providing this bottle in a recent box exchange. Shared bottle with tai4ji2x (Xenon) as part of a trade (and share evening)
Poured with a visual thickness to it and quickly a thick bronze head formed. Beer was glossy and the deepest brown in color. Some clingy lace remained.
At this point I need to mention that the flavor and aroma of this beer continuously developed and changed as we worked our way through the bottle. One of the more complex and chameleon like beers I’ve ever had.. (meant as a total compliment.
At first the aroma was of deep dark chocolate and this hung thick in my nostril. It was also obvious that chilis were a part of the brew. As mentioned above this continued to move and develop.
The first several sips were absolutely wonderful and screamed of a thick, deep dark chocolate up front with some spicy chili in the rear. Even if this had never changed, I loved this beer right from the start. (it had be at hello!) But this was just the beginning. I told Xenon that I would give him credit for this and I just did… He mentioned that the next phase was very reminiscent of chewing tobacco. He was spot on with this. A bit of spice, some tobacco and still the sense of chocolate. I think this was the beginning of the transition to the other flavors….. As the beer warmed first the cinnamon came to the forefront, and then the vanilla. While early it was dark chocolate, later is was cocoa powder…. And at one point I commented to Xenon that it was as if every permutation of the major components took their turn at center stage. As with life the beer seemed to come full circle and the ending was again the dark chocolate. I am sure that we became accustomed to the spice and other flavors came forward as it warmed… but it was clear to us that the spiciest three sips were the first three.
Body matched the complex flavors and was quite bold.
Just an awesome beer and one where I need to try to find another bottle… ISO to be posted soon. For me this was very special… Alex thanks so much for sending. Xenon, happy to share it with you. 2,254 charactersReagan1984, Jan 20, 2013

Pour thick dark brown like melted chocolate.
Smells of rich chocolate and spice.
Tastes like a chili truffle, all dark chocolate and spice. The peppers are in the forefront, there's even a subtle green vegetable quality, and it's not offputting at all. Delicious.
Very thick mouthfeel, again reminds me of drinking a gourmet chocolate beverage.
This beer is awesome, almost as good as Hunahpu's. Can't wait for the barrel aged version.

A heavy name for a heavy beer. Sometimes beer can be so serious and deep that you can get lost as it unfolds with each sip. Complexity meets drinkability with a dull warning of strength. It is beers of this character that further forge what American beer is and represent the intentions of craft brewers. Search this beauty out. 696 charactersBeerAdvocate, Jan 17, 2013

Score: 97
November 2012 vintage bottle served in a Half Acre snifter and enjoyed on 01/04/12.
Appearance: Pours a coffee color with two or three fingers of dark mocha head off the pour that slowly settles to a thin layer atop the glass. Awesome lacing and retention. Pitch perfect stout appearance. 5/5
Smell: The nose is dominated by it's three primary advertised ingredients. The cinnamon is most prominent, followed in "boldness" by the chili peppers and milk chocolate. There is some brown sugar and roast too. The chili pepper aroma grows as the beer warms up. At room temperature, there is a faint dark fruit character present in the nose as well. 4.75/5
Taste: The flavor is likewise defined by it's three primary ingredients, but with the amount of chili and cinnamon flipped (that is to say that the chili pepper flavor is more prevalent than the cinnamon on the palate). The pepper element imparts a nice amount of "life" on the tongue without being overly "spicy" courtesy of the the chocolate backbone anchor. The cinnamon flavor reminds me of Cinnamon Toast Crunch cereal because it is paired with malted barley/cereal grain flavor too. Cocoa, dark chocolate and faint vanilla round out the flavor profile. 4.5/5
Mouthfeel: Not quite full bodied, but approaching it. Spot on carbonation. Good liveliness on the palate from the chili peppers. 4.5/5
Overall: This brew is an absolute Hunahpu's killer without the accompanying "rarity tax." Kudos to Perennial for yet another knock out brew.
Recommendation: Fans of chili stouts and Cinnamon Toast Crunch cereal NEED to seek this one out.
Pairings: Chris Gierhart's homemade chili.
Cost: $22.99 for a 750 ml bottle. 1,758 charactersjegross2, Jan 05, 2013

S: Chilies, cinnamon with a sweet milk chocolate. Light vanilla, sweet malts with a heavy dose of roast as well.
T: So much chocolate in this guy. Fudge and brownie notes with a lot of milk chocolate creaminess. Cinnamon with a light chili flavor. Very rich and decadent. A touch of roasted malts on the finish cuts the sweetness.
M: Heavy bodied, rich and creamy mouthfeel with a smooth carbonation level. The finish is delicious chocolate with a subtle hint of chili flavor.
O: This is how a chili chocolate stout should taste like. This blows Hunahpu's out of the water IMO and I'm not afraid to say it. Perennial killed it on this last batch. 838 charactersTreebs, Jan 02, 2013

Pours a deep, dark, near-blacked out color with a thinner tanned head resting on top. Faint retention with filmy coating and spotty lacing on the glass. 
Absolutely wonderful nose with an excellent mix of spices - cinnamon, vanilla beans, chile spice. Chocolate and toasted dark malts with cocoa and light sweetness. Faint alcohol warmth. 
Combination of warmth from chiles and sweetness from chocolate and vanilla beans up front. Cinnamon and spice throughout the profile, which is masterfully balanced with the roasted dark malts. Sweetness driven by cocoa and dark chocolate. Finishes with chile spice, vanilla and light boozy heat. 
Full body, well carbonated, chewy and creamy on the tongue. I LOVE the idea of chiles and spice in beers, but rarely are they ever executed this well. Next to Hunahpu's, this is one of my favorite non-barrel aged stouts of all time. 929 charactersxnicknj, Dec 26, 2012

Thick, thick, thick, like motor oil. Small tan head that dissipates pretty quickly, but there's visible bubbling and carbonation throughout.
Smell is excellent. Chocolate, chili, cinnamon, vanilla, maybe a tiny bit of roast. Really rich and decadent, kind of a brownie batter kind of smell.
Taste is bigger on the bitterness and the spice. I was surprised at how much the spice has held up despite the age on this bottle. There's some dark chocolate, cinnamon, chili, bitter coffee roast, maybe a slight bit of vanilla sweetness. Not as good as the nose, but still very good.
Mouthfeel is great. Thick, oily, coats the mouth. Nice carbonation.
What a great stout. This combination of flavors is just excellent, and I think I'd like it almost no matter who did it, or how. Hunahpu's is still king, but this is a damn fine alternative. 847 charactersrodkin, Sep 10, 2012

A touch of pepper is present on the nose in the background. The taste is incredibly dry and full of cacao. This features that raw chocolate flavor which makes for a very robust and deep flavor. This pairs nicely with the thick stout base. Notes of licorice and cinnamon come through in the middle and cayenne makes an appearance at the end. The heat is minimal and builds slowly as the beer warms. Mouthfeel is thick and sturdy with moderate carbonation. Overall, this is a tasty, full flavored, and rich beer. Definitely worth a try.

A- Pours a completely opaque dark black with about a finger of very creamy mocha brown head that has decent retention and leaves some spotty lacing.
S- Lots of cinnamon followed by light chilis and some chocolate. Definitely above average aroma strength. Kind of a little bit too much cinnamon and overall the smell is a little bit off-putting, definitely unique though.
T- Lots of cinnamon, some light chili peppers that don't add too much heat but a little bit of flavor, finishes with some dark chocolate mixed with light cinnamon that lingers on the palate. Interesting, not as off-putting as the aroma, but not bad. Chili builds a little bit as you drink but never too hot. 
M- Creamy, a tiny bit thin for a double, smooth, a tiny bit syrupy but not bad. Easy to drink.
O- This was definitely an interesting beer. I wouldn't say I completely liked the taste but it was definitely an interesting try that I enjoyed having. I would have definitely toned down the cinnamon a little bit, I found that to be a tiny bit off putting but not bad. I'd recommend trying this if you like unique stouts. 1,208 charactersjaasen64, Aug 08, 2012

From a 750 into a snifter. 
Bottled in November 2011
Brewed with ancho chili peppers, cacao nibs and cinnamon sticks. 
APPEARANCE: A black pour yields a 2+ finger, medium looking, dark tan head with very good retention. Opaque black body and lower levels of carbonation evident. Head slowly fades to a good foam cap. A slight wisp and ring remain but leave no real lacing down the glass. 
SMELL: Medium nose of roasted and chocoalte malts, with a light touch of sweet cream and chili pepper notes. This is mostly roasted malts and cacao nibs, though there is a touch of chili and cinnamon in there as well. A nice nose with enough strength. 
TASTE: Roasted malts and some nice dark chocolate up front. Nice initial flavor, with the chili and cinnamon coming out more at the swallow. Big, persistent aftertaste of peppery spicy flavors, cacao, sweet cream and some roasted malts. Chocoalte definitely plays a leading roll, but this is well balanced and very flavorful, with chili and cinnamon in just the right dose. Enjoyable and addictive. 
PALATE: Medium body and medium carbonation. Enough weight on the palate. Very creamy smooth, goes down smooth and finishes slightly mouth-coating. A bit of peppery spice lingers on the tongue. 
OVERALL: This is quite good. The adjuncts are definitely there with the chocolate taking the lead, and nothing dominates or is out of place. This reminds me of a more mellow Hunahpu; perhaps a bottle with a couple years on it. The nose could be a little bolder and adjuncts could be a touch bigger still, but overall, this was excellent. Thanks again for the beers man. I really enjoyed this one. 1,785 charactersJeffo, Jul 05, 2012

This beer pours a full bodied midnight black in color with a beautiful, creamy dark mocha head. It looks perfect! The nose is rich and malty. There is a lot of cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg spice in the nose with dark chocolate, bitter coffee roast, and slight fresh, green (in terms of maturity) pepper. The nose changes as time goes on, making this one very complex and more enjoyable as you proceed. The flavors are big and full of bitter dark chocolate and coffee roast. There is also plenty of spice presence, cinnamon and nutmeg. There is also some freshly cut pepper in the finish but it is somewhat subdued (on purpose I would imagine, to satisfy more people). It has nice flavor and all of the ingredients work in unison. It drinks full in body and coats your palate. It's a nice beer and well worth the $19 or so per bottle. This is the closest thing I've seen to Hunahpu yet and perhaps better than current batches. 965 charactersaasher, Jun 17, 2012

Coming from Tampa, FL, the land of Hunahpu, it'll be interesting to see another brewery's taste on the formula. This beer pours out deep black with two fingers of thick, mocha head. The aroma is more heavy on the cinnamon and chocolate than the roast, with a surprising amount of smoked character to it as well. Some of this might come from the Ancho chilis, which don't have a high level of heat, but plenty of spicy flavor. The taste is pretty heavily spiced with the cinnamon and the flavors of the chili. The chili really dominates this beer without contributing much heat at all. There's some roast, coffee, and vanilla in here for sure too, especially in the beginning. The mouthfeel isn't really that heavy, and it goes down fairly slickly. Some more heft on the body wouldn't hurt, but the heavy chili flavor excuses some of it. The drinkability is actually quite good. Overall, it's a good chili imperial stout. Come in expecting chili flavors without the heat, and you'll be happy. 1,035 charactersshand, May 31, 2012

S- Smells of smoke, coffee, chili and bit of cinnamon but not much. Smell was pretty delicious but not my favorite smelling beer.
T- Amazing! I was not ready for this beer to be that good. The coffee at first, then a bit of vanilla. After that i taste the cinnamon and finished with some spicy tingle of the chili pepper. IT was perfectly balance. Its actually hard to describe.
M- Full body, thick and creamy. I really enjoyed drinking this one
O- This is probably the best beer out of St Louis. Im not sure how limited this supply is but if you can get it do it! I was lucky to get a few bottles. One down and going to try and age the other. I highly doubt it makes it past next week. Its way to good right now to wait. 861 characterscmdmzmjm, Apr 29, 2012

Oh, thanks to fo1ksguitar and cardern for the Perennial trades!
A fantastic pour--deep mahogany brown body that verges on midnight black. The head is creamy, dark toffee-colored, and superbly retained. The aroma brings to mind cinnamon drizzled atop a pumpkin espresso. Cacao nibs are hard to find, but it's earthy, with a hint of spicy chili and booze. Nice so far...
Oh yeah, that's tasty. Rich notes of bitter dark chocolate coat the palate, followed swiftly by mocha and coffee roast. Ancho chilies add a decadent heat to the sides of the tongue that compliment the mild boozy warmth in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium-thick with a creamy carbonation level that's spot-on for the style. Chewy in all the right spots, and just a tad sticky with residual sugars in the finish. Overall, an excellent imperial stout. A slow-sipper, for sure, but decadence with every nip. 1,021 characterswagenvolks, Apr 26, 2012

A: Pours black with a thin dark brown head that vanished quickly into soapy lace. 
S: Smokey smelling with notes of bacon, chili, hints of cocoa and a touch of cinnamon. Smells meaty. 
T: Follows the nose with flavors of chilis, cinnamon, smoky meat and cocoa. Cinnamon lingers in the finish. 
M: Medium-full body, fuzzy and clean carbonation, smooth mouthfeel. Alcohol is well hidden. 
O: Really integrated and impressive. Not too spicy but rather the chili compliments the complex flavors. Thanks again Mr. Clean! 540 charactersscottfrie, Apr 22, 2012
4.33/5  rDev -2.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5I stumbled upon this one by chance when I was in Fairview Heights, IL. What a find. 
Standard stout dark brown/borderline black color, but the head really sets it apart. It's an inch of dark sandy colored, frothy head. 
The aroma is a slightly bitter dark bakers' chocolate, anise, and light cinnamon. 
The cocoa and cinnamon really pop in the flavor along with vanilla and an earthy spice in the finish, presumably from the chiles. There's no heat to it, but it does leave an earthy aftertaste that, when compounded with the sweetness of the cocoa, is superb. 
Mouthfeel is soft with mild carbonation and slightly dry. 
This is a fantastic representation of the style and a flat out great beer. The pricepoint is high at $20, but that seems to be the direction limited releases are going. This one at least delivers and I'm looking forward to trying more of Perennial's beers. 882 charactersVonerichs, Apr 12, 2012

Split two ways, cellar temp into snifter on 3/4.
Beautiful dark brown coloring, nice thick, tan head, ample lacing left on the glass.
Dark roast up front on the nose. Followed by cocoa, touch of vanilla, trace of cinnamon, no real chili here.
This is exactly what I want in a stout like this. First the roast from the malt, followed by the spice. The chili flavor was the perfect amount. Enough to let you know that it is there, but in no way overpowering.
Feel- one word 'perfect'.
I really enjoyed this beer. That being said, due to the price point, plus having to trade/ship to obtain it, not sure how soon it will be until I have it again. 687 characterssteggers, Mar 05, 2012

Aromas begin as advertised with chocolate and roast initially. Spices emerge more as it warms. Light vanilla, cinnamon and more milky chocolate as well.
The tastes follow the nose with dark roasted malt, cocoa and dark baker's chocolate. As you further sample you get light spice (light heat and cinnamon) that linger ever-so-slightly in the background after you get past the initial dark chocolaty malt backbone. Espresso flavors emerge as it warms more. Also much more spice in the aroma than in the flavor which is fine by me.
The mouthfeel is medium to heavy bodied with ample carbonation. Finish is full, rich and smooth with a light roastiness that hangs around a little on the palate.
Overall this reminds me a lot of a Cigar City Hunahpu Lite. Not as intense by any means in any of the flavor aspects that both beers share, but all are present and created a much more balanced beer overall. The wow factor isn't there like with Hunahpu but a really solid beer overall; not sure it's worth the almost $20 outlay but it more accessible than Hunahpu which counts for something. 1,219 charactersclaspada, Feb 21, 2012

Look: Black and totally opaque with a 1/2 inch tan head and good retention
Smell: Ancho chili's quite a bit of cinnamon and some cocoa nibs. Very delicious smelling beer
Taste: The flavor is as advertised. Upfront is a nice a amount of cocoa nibs and a touch of vanilla and then mid palate the cinnamon completely takes over the beer but is well received. The beer finishes with a touch more chocolate and the perfect amount of chili heat. Very nice flavors
Mouthfeel: Full body low carbonation and just a hint of heat
Overall: I thought this to be a exceptional example of the style. All the ingredients were well integrated and well balanced. Glad I still have batch 1 in my cellar. 732 charactersDarthKostrizer, Feb 14, 2012

Into a mini pint, it pours black with an ample head of persistent dark tan foam, almost the color of dark leather. It leaves rings of intricate lacing all around. 
Dark chocolate aroma, clean and dry, some light bitterness and a hint of spicy cinnamon in there as it warms up. 
Bittersweet dark chocolate intertwines subtly with mellow cinnamon spice and a vague dark fruit component from the anchos at room temp. Very smooth and chocolaty, the foam itself has a chocolate milkshake consistency. Medium bodied and especially drinkable for an Imperial Stout. 606 charactersemerge077, Feb 12, 2012

A - Pours black, mocha-colored head, nice collar, spotty lace.
S - The spice was very upfront when I first poured this, but it after it warmed a bit, it melded nicely with the chocolate and vanilla notes. Big baker's chocolate, spices, roast, and vanilla notes. Nice.
T - The chocolate and roast are really nice, and the spice adds a small kick on the end, but doesn't overpower the beer. Really a nice balance of sweet & spice, good stuff. The finish is creamy chocolate sweetness with a slight spicy kick.
M - Full, rich and smooth, good carbonation, creamy finish.
O - A really enjoyable Imperial Stout that we all seemed to enjoy. The spices and sweetness were right in-line with what I prefer, and there wasn't too much of either one. Looking forward to having this again and all the variants that will come along as well.
Edit: I think the spices were "turned down" because of the age on this bottle (being batch #1). I haven't had a batch #2 yet, so I can't comment on the spices in there. 1,063 charactersSean9689, Feb 09, 2012

The taste matched the aroma. Cocoa, dark chocolate, chilis, roasted malts, vanilla and berries. Nice warmth to the palate. Not sure how much came from the chilis and how came from the 10% alcohol.
Full bodied and creamy with a lighter carbonation.

A - Big creamy mocha foam that settles to a thin cap, leaving splotchy lace behind. Dark brown body - doesn't really look like an Imperial Stout, but it is attractive.
S - Smells exactly as advertised - ancho chiles, cinnamon, and cocoa nibs.
T - The taste is pretty similar, with the aforementioned adjuncts dominating the palate, and some dark chocolate and roast character coming out in the finish.
M - Smooth, creamy, medium-full body. Lower carbonation, melted chocolate texture, and shockingly well-hidden booze - I had no idea this was 10%.
D - This was really good for 4-6oz, but I can imagine it getting fatiguing after that point. Still, it's quite well done and I would happily try it again. Best beer I've had from Perennial. 829 charactersMasterSki, Feb 04, 2012

Thanks for opening this, DarthKostrizer!
Nearly black in color with a moderately sized brown head that eventually leaves spots of lace down the glass.
The aroma is an interesting and unique combination of roasted and black malts, plenty of chile spice (like chipotle), a bit of cinnamon, and even a bit of pine presence. It all comes together quite interestingly and nicely.
The flavor is as complex as the aroma, with cinnamon and chile elements pushing through the roasted, dark malt backbone. There's also traces of smoke and wood. The chile flavor is obviously present without being overtly spicy.
Medium bodied with moderate carbonation.
A unique and incredibly flavorful, evolving stout. 721 charactersehammond1, Feb 01, 2012

Poured from the Dark Brown Labeled bottle w/ ABRAXAS cleverly branded into a 12oz Snifter Glass. Has "bottled 11/2011" on the side of the label.
Aroma- Has a coffee aroma from the beginning with light booziness. Rich malts then come through and a slight amount of hop. Double Coffee Stout aroma?
Appearance- Pours a 1 finger head that is dark brown and lasts for an average amount of time. Has a dark brown colored body that you can't see past. Leaves dark suds behind. 
Flavor- Tons of coffee, malt, and sweetness make up this brew. Very rich and has a nice amount of intensity. Finishes with a medium bitterness level. 
Mouthfeel- Full Bodied, Light Carbonation, Textured with grit that wasn't very favorable, and then leaves bit of alcohol with coffee behind. 
Overall Impression- A nice 2X Stout and one of my favorites now from Perennial Ales! I'm glad the St. Louis beer community has grown so much in the past year to be able to enjoy nice ones such as these. The only part of this brew I didn't enjoy was the gritty finish... Would like to age one of these and see how it grows this next year! 1,209 charactersDCon, Jan 30, 2012

Batch 2. Bottled November 2011.
Pours an opaque black with a khaki head that fades to an oily film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form all over the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark malt, cocoa, cinnamon, and chile. Taste is of dark roasted malt, cinnamon, chile, cocoa, and slight coffee beans. A medium roasty bitterness lingers on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is an awesome stout with some awesome aromas and flavors. 597 charactersUCLABrewN84, Jan 29, 2012

Batch 1
The beer pours a gorgeous oily dark dark liquid with a nice 1,5 inch dark tan head. aLmost mocha like. Very nice look to this beer. The head is very dense and has extreme retention to it. It slowly makes its way down the sides of the glass while leaving a nice sticky coating on the sides. Gorgeous.
Aroma starts off with some nice mild vanilla bean notes and definitely some nice cinnamon sticks. The background is underlaying by some nice coca notes. Some mild bitter chocolate and some nice sweet milk chocolate. It is not that intense though. Needs a bit more kick for a 4.5 but still good.
Flavor is a bite more intense. Cinnamon stick notes and vanilla bean mixed in together. Very nice and smooth and oily. Great mouthfeel. The middle of the beer highlights some more of the chocolate notes, milk chocolate sweetness with some intense dark chocolate intensity and bitterness. There is also some nice coffee roast in the middle along with the awesome chocolate. The peppers are present a bit but not too intense which is good for me. There is definitely some nice spice to it though. The finish sees some more of the vanilla and cinnamon notes and it finishes off with some nice bitterness as well and some mild spice.
This brew is delicious. Its definitely very creative and has some complex and interesting notes but it is very well crafted. 1,420 charactersJoEBoBpr, Jan 25, 2012
4.22/5  rDev -5.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5A - pours black with a 1 finger, chocolaty head 
S - nose is really chocolaty (rich and dark) with notes of vanilla and spicy, ancho chillies
T - starts of with sweeter chocolate flavors that morph into dark, dry chocolates. A modicum of vanilla comes through toward the back and is overtaken by the heat of the chillies. I think the cinnamon got lost in the mix somewhere (I couldn't pick it out). Nice complexity, the chocolates and chillies provide a nice balance as well.
M - medium body, creamy with a little carbonation
D - solid effort by the folks at Perennial. The price is a little steep, but I went out and bought a bottle after having it on tap. I look forward to trying it again. Recommended! 709 charactersbirchstick, Jan 21, 2012
4.41/5  rDev -0.9%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Appearance: Black as hell with fingers of thick, pillowy head that sits on top and does not move. Its evil looking--totally evil looking. Big alcohol feet on the sides.
Smell: Nose was a little more subtle than I would have expected. Sweet chocolate nibs, breakfast roast coffees, cinnamon, and an ever so slight vanilla in the back followed by a peppery sting in the nostrils. Probably the chiles. 
Taste: Damn! Deep roasted malts followed by sweet chocolate nibs that seem dark in some sips and a bit sweeter in others. Control on the chocolate nicely executed. These flavors are brought through with that vanilla bean. Gives it a creamy sort of smell-- reminds me of Breakfast Stout some in this regard. But the kicker is the finish on this one. Cinnamon and ancho chiles give it a spiciness and a pepperiness that is just as original as I've seen in a while. Barrel-aged freaks love the burn on the end of a big impy stout...this one burns on the finish because of the spiciness. Layered perfectly. 
Mouth: Big body, low carbonation, slight peppery burn on the end from chiles and cinnamon.
Overall: Kick ass brew. There were a lot of highlights this evening but this one was my favorite. I'm left wanting just a bit more body and a little bigger nose. Its probably tricky considering that a bigger nose might make the spice in the mouth a bit too large. Highly recommend this one. If he perfects it, it could win awards I bet. 1,435 characterspaxchristi, Jan 21, 2012

A - Pours blacker than night with about an inch of milk chocolate brown colored head. The head never faded completely and a fair amount of lacing was left on the glass.
S - The nose is full of of semisweet chocolate, roasted malts, and vanilla. Hints of cinnamon and a faint smokiness are also present. Very complex and inviting.
T - The roasted malts lead the way on the tongue along with some dark chocolate. A little cinnamon and some spiciness from the peppers appears right before the finish. The flavors are all layered perfectly and nothing dominates.
M - Full bodied, smooth, and creamy. Little carbonation, which is expected from a big imperial stout.
O - Overall, a very enjoyable imperial stout. A little pricey at $19 for a 750, but I have a couple more bottles in the basement and am excited to see how it develops over time. I'm also looking forward to trying some of the other offerings from Perennial. 1,053 charactersratedz, Jan 21, 2012

A: Opaque black, darkest of the dark, with a tan fine head that stuck around and laced quite nicely. 
S: Lots of vanilla, and cinnamon which I didn't recognize until tasting the beer. Also the chocolate notes were smooth, not pungent or burnt like a lot of other popular imperials. This was incredibly similar to the aromas on the Hunahpu's imperial stout, which is an all time classic.
T: Excellent, very smooth with just a tiny hint of chilli peppers. I do like vanilla, but the only reason I didn't give a 5 was the off balance of vanilla (there was a lot). IT had a very non-traditional imperial taste. Zero booze or bitterness came through.
M: Wonderful, very when carbonate and matched quite well with the velvety texture of the beer.
O: Can't wait to drink again, but not too much as it was $19 a 750ml plus shipping. 866 charactersYumYumGumGum, Jan 11, 2012

Appearance -- Pours a deep dark brown with a slim mocha head. Nice.
 
Smell – Rich with dark chocolate and vanilla, also with the faint aromas of cinnamon and smoky chiles. Inviting.
 
Taste – Semisweet dark chocolate, vanilla bean and cinnamon are the most noticeable, followed by licorice and leather and a very faint pepper smokiness. Well-balanced, if only a little too reserved. I wish there was less licorice phenolic flavor to muddle up the spice and pepper, but otherwise tasty.
 
Mouthfeel – Full-bodied with mellow carbonation – velvety, not syrupy. A fine line that Abraxas does not cross.
 
Overall – A pleasant surprise! Good mesh of flavors, though I wish there was more chile heat. Great effort, definitely worth trying, and I look forward to trying more from Perennial. 838 charactersyeahnatenelson, Dec 22, 2011

S- chili gives it a nice smokiness, cinnamon spiciness blends well into the chili power. Almost like star anise. Unusual. Some light sweetness if vanilla on back end. Very faint though and something to be desired. 
T- fantastic roast. Bitter grain mixes with cinnamon the best I've ever had. Chocolate comes out next rolling into a malty, very low bitter and light light heat. Finishes chili flavor and some bitterness right in center. Vanilla doesn't translate well and I really wanted some. 
M- nice creamy body. Velvet body. Good carb. Low heat leaves some desire. sticky sticky flavors and light bitterness.

As part of their 'The Cellar' series, Perennial has churned out their take on a Mexican hot chocolate. The beer is an American Imperial Stout in style and is brewed with ancho chili peppers, cacao nibs, freshly ground cinnamon sticks, and freshly cut and scraped vanilla beans.
The beer pours out deep brown with a light brown head and wonderful lacing. The smell of the beer showcases what you will experience during the drink. You're able to individually pull out each of the ingredients used both in the aroma and throughout the drink. Upfront on the drink you get the blend of chocolate and vanilla with a little cinnamon. On the swallow you get a pop of the cinnamon and a pleasant heat from the chili peppers. The heat - which isn't over or underdone - really comes from the peppers, not from the alcohol. The beer drinks dangerously smooth for it's higher ABV and is one you can sip all night if it suits your fancy.
Overall, an amazing beer that I highly recommend either driving to St Louis for or looking for people to trade with for their 750ml bottles. It's sure to be an highly anticipated annual release from one of St Louis' newest breweries. 1,267 charactersjmvecchio1, Dec 16, 2011
