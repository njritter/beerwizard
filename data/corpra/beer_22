More candied oranges, pinneapple, hints of mango, all with a solid hoppy backbone to compliment it. Not much malt detected, which is a good thing. Mouthfeel is soft and pillowy.

S: Oh my, this is wonderful. Surprisingly, it was much more like candied pineapple than I expected for a citra-hopped DIPA, but it was a wonderful and powerful aroma.
T: Juicy, with the right sweetness for a DIPA. It doesn't showcase citra as well as Pseudo Sue or Zombie Dust--at least for me, the extra sweetness takes away the pure citra taste of those others--but the candied citrus fruits with just a bit of resin on the back end of King Sue are wonderful. 
F: Thick with average carbonation for the style.  The booze wasn't well hidden or particularly noticeable; again about average for the style (which was fine)
O: This was wonderful. Thanks to Crubbsy for the trade! 746 characterse_oly, May 20, 2017

T/F:  Rich... caramel malts sets you up for an awesome bitter citrus hop profile.  Loaded with tropical fruits... follows the nose.  Great complexity... oily and slick on the tongue.  Super well balanced.  Finish is bitter and fruity.  Medium to full bodied... again, rich and just delicious.

4/26/17 bomber--Just over two weeks on this one. Poured cold into a snifter. I personally prefer snifters to tulips for DIPAs.
Pours a cloudy opaque NE IPA style orange. Just over a finger head that hangs around for a bit on the first pour--not much lacing. A much foamier two finger head on the second pour that leaves a good deal of lacing.
Aroma hits you as soon as the cap comes off. Smells very similar to DDH (not a bad thing at all!) but richer and hoppier. So, mangoes, melon, orange, and grapefruit. Exceedingly juicy.
Taste is a perfect blend of juicy and bitter. Definitely more bitter than DDH and just as (possibly more) juicy. Definitely more citrus taste here--lots of orange and grapefruit with a bit of mango. Just a touch of booze at the end. Definitely has a bitter bite to it but the balance of fruit, hops, and alcohol is what makes this beer great.
Feel is heavy yet smooth. Very slight alcohol warming. Lower on the carbonation.
Overall, a fantastic DIPA--juicy, bitter, and smooth drinking. Everything that is great about TG single IPAs but now hoppier and therefore more bitter. 1,179 charactersBdubz94, May 13, 2017

Fresh bottle with the new labeling into IPA glass.
Looks like a glass of Orange juice, seriously. Opaque yellow with minimal head.
Smells of juicey fresh squeezed OJ and Pineapple right out of the cap.
Tastes extreamly bitter but at the same time my pallet wants more.  
Feels smooth, silky & resinous, like no other DIPA I've ever tried.
Overall this lives up to its hype.  It's a very hop forward bitter bomb that somehow is Extreamly easy to finish.

4.75/5  rDev +2.6%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Hot on the heels of Pseudo Sue, this monstrous version is now unleashed on the Iowa beerscape. Chocked full of Citra hops and elevated to imperial status, and we've got a beast of a hop bomb on our hands that not even the brewers of Toppling Goliath can hold back.
King Sue quickly engulfs the senses with its radiant citrusy perfume with a mere pop of the cap. Straight grapefruit and tangy orange juice fills the nose and the glass as both the beer's fragrance and appearance takes on the exact character of fresh squeezed citrus juices. Its taste hinges on faint caramel and honey to heighten the impression of branch ripe fruit succulence.
But its seemingly fructose laden sweetness quickly retreats and the hops take firm control of the middle palate. Vibrant red grapefruit, ripe tangerine, mandarin, blood orange and a hint of both lemon and lime carry a citrus heavy taste across the tastebuds, saturating each of them with its sherbet-like tang. Nearly sour, the hops are so intense that they take on a tart citrus flavor before heading into a pleasantly bitter finish of fresh grassiness, herbaceous, and hemp-like flavor.
Medium bodied and trending dry, its the fruit-centric succulence and slight starchiness from malt that prevent absolute dryness. But with absolute resinous bitterness instead, their drying effects clean the finish and usher in a long and brilliant grapefruit aftertaste. This is a world class IPA that has the "juiciness" of New England IPA, but with the bitterness of those of the West Coast - Best of both worlds! 1,551 charactersBEERchitect, Mar 15, 2017

Had that incredible smell I love from TG IPAs like DDH sue. Has great mouthfeel that is reasonably thick. The taste is everything I wanted to be, but I have to mention that I'm getting the slightest (and I really mean slightest) alcohol burn to it. Not fair to compare them, but DDH sue was so smooth with that low ABV, it tastes noticeable in this beer by comparison. Didn't take too much away from it. 
Overall great beer! 515 charactersJrodsmrs51, Mar 09, 2017

Look- A thick hazy orange color. A thick  finger of white head that dissipates fairly quickly. Nice lacing down the entire glass. 
Smell- A tropical fruit explosion. Citra hops with notes of mango, grapefruit and maybe peaches. The citrus smell dominates and screams drink me. 
Taste- Exactly like the smell indicated. No taste of alcohol for a double IPA. The tropical flavors blend into a fantastic brew and the hops remind you its a great beer. 
Mouthfeel- The carbonation is perfect for this one. The malt in there balances the entire drink. 
Overall- Reminds me of being on a nice beach trip relaxing with tropical delight. Reminds me of some the most popular NE beers, but something is really different about this one. About halfway through the bottle the DIPA came through. Fantastic beer. Get it if you have a chance. 884 charactersKdouble, Mar 09, 2017

4.76/5  rDev +2.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Cloudy/turbid with almost a faint peach colored appearance. Thin, fast breaking white head dings what is otherwise a great looking beer. Smell is fantastic with tropical notes of mango and pineapple attacking one nostril and dank, earthy weed attacking the other. Off the charts complex nose. Taste mirrors nose with a big initial attack of citrus - very much like fresh squeezed orange juice and grapefruit juice combined. Dankness then follows with earthy, lingering pine on a long nicely bitter finish. Feel is on the medium side with an underlying creaminess. Overall this beer deserves the hype - it is a well constructed DIPA that's a pleasure to drink. 659 charactersbound4er, Mar 01, 2017

Huge nose and flavor from this beer, fits right in with the top contenders for the best west coast style DIPA. I'd put it right up there as being just as good as, or at least a VERY close second to Pliny (easily my favorite DIPA to date). The hops punch your palate right in the sweet spot, and the huge, citrus flavors balance this out to perfection. I will definitely be seeking this out whenever it's available! 487 charactersJangoon24, Jan 26, 2017

The taste follows with lots of tropical and citrus fruit with subtle bitter pine on the finish. Full texture with medium carbonation. World class. 354 charactersFurlinator, Jan 23, 2017

4.94/5  rDev +6.7%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Bottle dated 4/28/17 poured into a Trillium snifter.  Hazy peach and orange colored body that poured a half finger of head and left very sporadic spots of lacing. Aroma is very Tree House-like. It's dank, fruity, candied, and slightly bubble gummy.  Taste is full on Citra hops with a candied citrus and bubble gum finish. The mouthfeel is really good, but not nearly as creamy as a Tree House or Trillium beer. Overall, this is an amazing DIPA that I wish was available in my market. 484 charactersMJSFS, Jan 14, 2017

4.49/5  rDev -3%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Bombers were just sitting there at the Lava Lounge in Waterloo, Iowa (which, for my money, is the best beer bar in the whole US of A).
This is the first hypey IPA I've had in a long while that didn't disappoint. 
Tastes, quite simply, like the largest citra bomb I've ever come across.  Gigantic mangoes, oranges, and pineapples start things off and dominate throughout. Unlike some of TG's lesser offerings, however, this one never fades to seltzer or gets unpleasantly syrupy.  It stays well balanced throughout and there's never any burn or intensity or anything else that would betray its relatively high ABV.
An XTreme beer, for sure, but one of the rare ones that seems to be attempting something beyond extremeness for extremeness' sake. 747 charactersmynie, Dec 31, 2016

4.74/5  rDev +2.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75I was lucky to find a few bottles of this in Rochester, MN. Merry Christmas to all, but especially the people I share this with! 
A - Poured into my XL snifter with a frothy white head that quickly recedes. Moderately hazy in the glass with a nice orange color. 
S - Huge citrus notes - mangoes, pineapples, peaches. A bit of a dank, resinous character. Tropical fruits for days - obviously hopped to hell and back!
T - Follows the nose. The tropical fruit flavors are right on the front of the tongue, with some lingering bitterness in the middle of the mouth. The bready malts make an appearance here as well, with just enough fruity sweetness to keep the drinkability at a maximum.
F - Nice balance between crushability and the nice malt backbone. Nicely carbonated, perfect for the style. 
O - It's a vacation in a bottle that transports me from this barren snowy wasteland down to a tropical caribbean island. My mind was blown in a similar way when I had Abrasive Ale on tap for the first time years ago - just incredibly dank, aromatic and extremely tropical. Sure maybe treehouse or trillium do some better things, but I don't have the capacity or cellar to trade for them. I will simply be a very happy camper if I can get this with regularity! Cheers people. 1,273 charactersgregy55902, Dec 24, 2016

4.62/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5This beer pours a very clear gold with a large head. The aroma is absolutely astonishing - grapefruit, mandarin orange, pineapple, guava, and passionfruit come jumping out of the glass. The flavor is nearly as bold, with juicey pineapple, grapefruit, and mandarin orange, and just a hint of other tropical notes. The sweetness from the malt is present but not overbearing. The mouthfeel is reasonably full and somewhat oily. Overall this is an amazing beer - very like pseudo, but with a bit more tropical feel, and just a lot bolder. 534 charactersCzequershuus, Dec 20, 2016

5/5  rDev +8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Bottled 9 days before review date. Poured cold from 22-ounce bottle into an oversized stemless wine glass. Impressive appearance, slightly hazy yellowish orange in color with a substantial white head that left tons of sticky lacing. Big aromas and flavors of citrus and tropical fruit, with pine resin and a hint of rosemary and light malt sweetness balancing the bold hop character. The finish is clean, crisp, and dry, a little bitter and astringent. If there is a session DIPA, this is it. Very drinkable, as each sip invites another and another. The crispness provides the perfect complement to a variety of foods. This one is not easy to come by, but it is well worth seeking out. 685 charactersdcotom, Dec 19, 2016

Aromas were very earthy and grassy, not so much citrus or pine. Would describe it having a somewhat savory and sweet smell, kind of like a salted caramel. The taste is similar, the hops present a very earthy flavor rather than citrus or pine.  Maybe some cut grass or some deep plant-like flavor. Finishes sweet and full-bodied in the mouth. 425 charactersBenish, Dec 08, 2016

L - Golden haze.  White head (1 finger) that is much creamier than your average IPA.
A - Tropical fruit out the wazoo.  What I think of with a citra hopped beer.
T - Similar to the smell.  Tropical, some sweetness, then some muted bitterness at the end. Easy to drink. 
M - Phenomenal.  Decently thick, but not quite chewy.
O - Lived up to my high expectations!  It reminds me of Heady Topper in a lot of ways, only not quite as thick.  Hop explosion, thick mouthfeel, you can tell the bitterness is there but it's almost hidden by the hops. 656 charactersChuckdiesel24, Oct 25, 2016

L:  Pours a beautiful, hazy, opaque orange.  Minimal head with long-lasting lattice and lacing on the glass
S: Amazing tropical profile on the nose.  Mango and pineapple predominate. Also with some sort of candied fruit, especially as it warms...perhaps candied apricot?  Probably the most tropical nose I have ever appreciated on a beer
T: Big tropical fruit explosion from the beginning.  Just enough bitterness from the hops to expertly balance the huge tropical fruit flavors, again predominantly pineapple and mango for me.  Long, smooth finish
F:  Medium body, creamy mouth feel for an IPA
O:  Amazing beer.  Easily the best DIPA that I have ever had.  Incredible tropical fruit flavor with the perfect bitter hop balance.  Depth of flavor, long finish, great color.  Really couldn't ask for more in a beer. Well worth the moderate work to obtain.  Glad I have two more bottles to savor 954 charactersCCBone, Oct 22, 2016

Pours very hazy (close to the now-famous NE-style IPAs), very orange. I'm one of those people that loves opaque beer, so I'm all for it. The smell is citra-forward as expected, and the taste itself is bursting with citra. The feel of the beer is pretty full for an IPA (probably reflected in the haziness of the beer). The only issue I have is the bitterness of it, which is similar to PsuedoSue (at least in canned form). It's a little sharper than I like, and detracts a little from the beer.
All in all, a fantastic citra-hopped beer. I won't kill myself to get it (there's too much nearby that's just as good to my taste), but I certainly won't pass on it if I see. Great job by TG, as always! 784 charactersSeanBond, Oct 21, 2016

T - Tastes exactly as the smell...so tropical, some candy sweetness to round it out. Super delicious and way too easy to drink.
M - excellent mouthfeel on this. Doesn't drink as thick as it looks.

Fresh bottle, less than 2 weeks old. Nice appearance, deep haze, amber-orange color, fluffy white head, good lacing. Aroma is strong with ammonia / cat pee, and earthiness. Not very appealing. More of the same in the taste, ammonia, very stale hops, resinous, with a background woody maltiness. Sticky mouthfeel and somewhat unpleasant. Overall not a very good IPA. Not terrible, just not something I'd want more than once. 453 charactersRifugium, Oct 19, 2016

4.19/5  rDev -9.5%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4.25Toppling Goliath King Sue
A: King Sue looks very much like the East Coast juice bombs that are all the rage at the time of this writing: brilliant orange, mostly opaque, and with quite a lot of beautiful, thick, white, meringue-like head. It is not quite as murky as offerings from Tree House or Trillium, and sits closer to something from The Alchemist or Hill Farmstead. Retention is above average, and lacing is very good. It is a beautiful beer. 4.75/5
A: Lots of orange juice and grapefruit come out up front, but there is an underlying pithy, earthy bitterness that aligns it more as a bridge between West Coast and East Coast schools of IPA. Hints of strawberry along with pineapple, mango, and some ripe apricot are present as well. There is a soft, doughy malt bill underneath it all. It is very appealing, but in what it is going for, it simply does not measure up to the true greats nowadays. 4.5/5
T: The self-proclaimed king comes across with a lot more bitterness than the nose implies. This crop of Citra was apparently a little odd. There is lots of fruit: mango, apricot, grapefruit, pineapple, and especially mandarin orange, but these are constantly interrupted by a somewhat off-putting level of bitterness. This would not be a problem in a different, West Coast beer, but it seems like it is trying so hard to be East Coast, like all TG beers have seemed to edge toward since the beginning. It is not even the actual bitterness that is the problem, but the way it comes across: chalky and medicinal, like a citrus chewable vitamin. The first seconds of each sip are full of juicy, delicious fruit, but then that bitterness stabs, relents, stabs, relents, and stabs again, ultimately leaving an unpleasant amount of chalky minerality in the mouth. Malt never gets a chance to show itself in anything more than the sweetness that accompanies the juicy fruit. This bitterness can work wonders in different beers and restrained more, but here it seems rampant, like it overran the rest of the beer. 4/5
M: The mouthfeel is medium-full, slightly creamy, and a little sticky, with carbonation on the low end but still within acceptable levels. Then, as with the taste, the bitterness dries out the mouth completely, almost causing a puckering sensation, like drinking especially hard water. It blows past the threshold of "refreshing" and steps resolutely into "unpleasantly astringent." There is a wisp of alcohol heat on the back end.  3.75/5
O: This came off a lot more harshly than I meant and a lot more harshly that I think the beer deserves. Like the most recent, disappointing batch of Mornin' Delight, something seems rotten in Decorah when it comes to executing their legendary beers. Make no mistake, this is still a very good IIPA; it may even be a great one, but its Jekyll and Hyde character just does not work for it. My overall rating still reflects that it is among the best IIPAs in the country, yet it has been close to perfection in the past. It could be the crop of Citra messing the beer up, or it could be an issue with the technical aspects of brewing. Whatever the case, this bridging of East and West IPA styles can be done well. It HAS been done well by this exact beer and ZeeLander, SoSus, Surly Todd the Axeman, and Half Acre Navaja, all of which have balanced a pleasant, earthy, dank, resinous bitterness with immense fruit character. This just fell a little short of stellar for me, but other batches have been awesome. It is knowing what else is out there and knowing how good these beers CAN be that makes this pale in comparison, yet still stand above the infinitesimal other IIPAs out there. Pair with disappointing follow-ups such as everything The Weeknd has done since The Trilogy. 4.25/5 3,748 charactersTHANAT0PSIS, Oct 12, 2016

I am always skeptical that these "epic" beers will live up to the hype, but I am happy to say that this is one of the ones that does.  Even after half a week of drinking IPAs, this stands out, with a pungently fruity, transparent and complex hop profile. 270 charactersnickfl, Oct 03, 2016

It is a cloudy glowing, orange gold. With a moderate pour it produces a smaller, whispy egg shell white head that leaves some spotty lacing. 
Holy bat balls! You can smell this thing before you get the glass within a foot of your face. TONS of tropical smelling citra hops. Very, very spicy and pungent. It stings the nostrils like Sex Panther Cologne. I notice mango, melon/cantelope, and pineapple. A touch of sweet, candied sugar and some caramel malts. 
It tastes like it smells and I couldn't be happier. So pungent. Easily one of the most dank/stanky/body odor smelling and tasting beers I have had in the past 2 years. It reminds me of my first time with Stone Enjoy By from that standpoint. Just exploding with mango. I feel like that creature on the front of the Dogfish Head Punkin Ale label with a mango. There is also stone fruit, cantelope, pineapple, and orange rind. Some bready malts sneak in at the end, but it has so much flavor that the base becomes drowned out just a hair. It drinks like an ipa to me just a bit. 
The feel is prickly, but not from the carbonation. It is also pretty interesting in consistency. I found it to be much heavier/more syrupy when it was colder than it was as it warmed up. Not sure I have ever experienced that before. Alcohol is not noticeable to me, and it is really easy to drink. 
Overall, this may be fairly one dimensional in a way as it is all citra hops all day, but I have not had a better citra hopped beer. Ever. Without doubt. I world class imperial ipa either way, but if you love the citra, this beer should be your Moby Dick. 1,664 charactersWesMantooth, Sep 21, 2016

A- Bomber pours into a large snifter with a slightly hazy golden yellow body and a huge creamy white cap. Great retention as the cap slowly falls to a large blanket dropping tons of lace sheets.
S- The Citra dominates the aroma with all hops all the way besides a touch of pale base grains. Falls between juicy and zesty citrus fruits with notes of tangerine, lime, passionfruit, mango, orange, grapefruit, grassy herbs and resin.
T- Turns to the dank side. Dank weedy herbs pop off with the juicy fruits from the hops. In rough order tangerine, zesty lime, bright orange juice, mango, passionfruit, melon, peach, floral, pine and herbal hops.
MF- Puffy and foamy medium body with high end smooth carbonation. A touch oily and the finish brings a clean bitterness.
A really good single hop Double IPA. Is it far ahead of the curve? No but its on the great side of that distribution. 918 characterscbutova, Sep 20, 2016

Appearance-  clear orange with nice white head and nice lacing.  
Smell-  citra in your face from first whiff.  I love citra hops so did it for me
Taste-  very solid and a slight improvement over pseudo sue.  But not quite as good as the Treehouse offerings I regularly consume
Mouthfeel- medium carbonation and light body. Very thirst quenching with late citra pucker
Overall-  this is an outstanding beer.  Worthy of its high ranking. It comes down to my preference for the hazy juice treehouse/trillium beers.   Stoked I was able to try this fresh after a year of searching for it 679 charactersjcflorian, Aug 21, 2016

Aroma punches you right in the nose, exploding with citrus and pine, incredible. Very strong mango aroma.
Taste is the aroma, part two. Deliciously sweet tropical fruit flavors immediately grace the tongue, along with with a strong pine finish. Very hoppy, playing nicely with the strong citrus flavor. Tropical presence of grapefruit, mango, and a touch of orange which immediately give way to said pine finish. Very sweet and bitter finish, mixed in a with a bite from the alcohol. This beer is truly hard to put down.
Medium-heavy body, with moderate carbonation. Very little detectable presence of alcohol for 8%. This is the tastiest, most drinkable beer I've ever had, and that is not hyperbole.\
One of those beers where you wonder beforehand "Will this live up to the hype?". This truly does. This is Pseudo Sue x2, which is saying a lot because PS is a great beer to begin with. You can always trust Toppling Goliath with IPAs, and this is no exception. 1,162 charactersmajorbase2, Aug 19, 2016

Overall:  I finally got to try one of the double IPAs from Toppling Goliath.  King Sue made it up to Wisconsin in decent quantity so I picked one up.  It's a quality beer, not mind blowing as the booziness peeked through a little too much.  Gives a nice hoppy flavor. 414 charactersMdog, Aug 14, 2016

Appearance: Pours a bright golden orange with a moderate amount of bubbles. Big two finger white head which slowly settles into a thin creamy patch. 
Smell: A very juicy and dank hop driven aroma with a scent of citrus fruit and pine. Citra hop scent of orange peel, grapefruit, mango, lemon, tangerine, passion fruit, papaya, melon, and pineapple. Earthy hop scent of pine resin,  grass, and slight onion. Background malt hints of caramel, grains, and cracker with yeast. Some hints of candied sugar. A really great ripe and juicy aroma. 
Taste: Like the smell previews, a very juicy and piney hop dominated taste with big notes of citrus fruit and pine resin. Upfront juicy citra hop presence with notes of grapefruit, orange peel, mango, tangerine, passion fruit, papaya, melon, lemon, and pineapple. Earthy hop notes of pine resin along with some grass and onion. Backing pale malt notes of caramel, grains, and cracker along with some yeast. A little candied sugar sweetness as well. A really great juicy taste. 
Mouthfeel: Medium to full bodied with a moderate amount of carbonation. Very juicy and oily with a drying finish. 
Overall: A really great Double IPA that lives up to the hype. Great citra hop and piney flavor. 1,278 charactersMattyG85, Aug 14, 2016

4.02/5  rDev -13.2%look: 5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.25 |  overall: 4.25Look - Medium orange color, light haze. Looks like they've started filtering this beer. First time I had it, it was opaque. Thick film head, good retention.
Smell - Sweet orange citrus, lightly earthy, lightly grainy. Very pleasant aroma, but not quite pungent enough for a double IPA.
Taste - Starts out with a thick, syrupy sweetness followed quickly by a pretty sharp bitter bite. Aftertaste is delicious Citra goodness, very long lingering. 
Mouthfeel - Full bodied, sweet, borderline cloying. More carbonation or perhaps a dryer finishing gravity would have benefited here.
Overall - Dump enough Citra into a beer and it's gonna be good. 646 charactersumustdrink, Aug 10, 2016

4.77/5  rDev +3%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75I don't have many "whalez," but this is one of them.  I've been trying for a couple of years to secure this and finally did so today.  Uber fresh (The King was bottled today), this is an exquisitely beautiful beer.  It's somewhere between a brilliant straw color and burnt orange, not clear but also not "murky" like the Northeast iterations of the style.  Lacing remains on the glass as you empty the glass, the body supporting 1-1/2 fingers of off-white head after an aggressive pour into a Hopslam tulip (my favorite beer glass).
The aroma is wave after wave of citrus - tons and tons of oranges and grapefruit, plus some passion fruit for what I get as sweetness.
The taste ..... the taste is all the citrus aromas, dancing on your tongue, from the beginning through the end of the taste.  There's orange and grapefruit and passion fruit, folding together to make this very gulpable - which is dangerous, given the 8.5% ABV, and really dangerous because there is no alcohol burn.
The feel is tart and creamy at the same time, which adds to the drinkability, and speaks to the body that is present.  I approached this with high expectations, and it exceeded those expectations - by a lot.  Abrasive is probably my favorite DIPA, but this is securely in position 1A. 1,271 charactersovaltine, Aug 06, 2016

It spent 5 days in shipping during a heat wave, and then 4 hours on my cement front steps in the sun before I put in the fridge. Also, it was a bit over 3 weeks old after it got here. Despite all that, this beer totally blew me away, and is amongst the best beers I've ever had. It pours a beautiful hazy orange with a very generous and creamy white head that leaves tons of lacing. The aroma features tropical fruits that include pineapple and mango, along with grapefruit peel and sugary malts. It's extremely juicy with and balanced. I love the malt backbone in this beer, it really brings out all the best citra can offer. I love the soft bitterness in the feel. The body is very silky yet well carbonated and it's not boozy at all. Overall this beer is just incredible. I haven't even finished it and am looking forward to the next time I can get my hands on it. 951 charactersCayseyW, Jul 19, 2016

I would have to taste this side by side with Psuedo Sue to see which one I prefer more. 261 charactersgibgink, Jul 11, 2016

Look - bright hazy orange with a medium white head.  Pretty thick lacing for a DIPA
Smell - HOPS!  Heavy grapefruit, honeydo, mango, orange, and a little wheat.  Unique combo of flavors really well put together.
Taste - Bitter hops, heavy orange, pineapple, grapefruit.  A lot of tropical flavors going on.
Feel - drinkable, a little heavy, but also very juice and refreshing.  Really smooth
Overall - world class.  a very complex combo a flavors that are perfectly balanced.  the uniqueness sets this apart from the rest 552 charactersrabbott2, Jul 04, 2016
4.56/5  rDev -1.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A: Moderately hazy with a glowing, dark orange-yellow hue. Soft off-white head leaves thick lacing around the glass.
S: Pungent overripe mango with freshly cut cantaloupe; some peach and pineapple as well; a very light, refreshing medley of sweet tropical fruit.
T: Extremely tropical while maintaining an elegant balance with the delicate malt backbone. Melon/cantaloupe dominate with supporting notes of mango and pineapple. Bits of peach and passionfruit. Definitely an herbaceous dank undertone to that can't be ignored from mid-mouth through the finish. Finish is heavy on the pithy grapefruit flavors, with medium-, heavily grassy bitterness and a very light bready malt character.
M: Medium carbonation, medium- bitterness on the finish. Somewhat, but not like some of the other heavy-hitting NE-style DIPAs. Alcohol is completely hidden, even as it warms. Medium dryness.
O: An outstanding DIPA. Juicy, fruity hop bomb that just barely hints at its ABV. A unique tropical fruit flavor character that leans more heavily on melon, mango, and pineapple than the more common orange and grapefruit. Sweet bready malt character almost perfectly balances out the hop explosion; coupled with a noticeable dryness, drinkability on King Sue is very high. Overall, this is up there with the best DIPAs I've had. 1,312 charactersavas, Jul 04, 2016

poured into gold logo TG snifter.
Appearance: hazy and opaque orange body with a bone white head. The beer pours a massive head with a moderate pour. Fantastic head retention that leaves thick coating of lacing on the glass.
Smell: Oranges, mango, papaya, and pineapple. Light bready malts.
Taste:  Truckloads of oranges and orange juice. Supporting cast of tropical fruits including mango, papaya, and pineapple. Light dankness and fresh cut grass. Very mellow with minimal bitterness. Especially with how big and juicy these hops taste. Hint of light bready malts. Finishes fairly clean with a slight lingering dankness.
Mouthfeel: medium bodied beer with moderate carbonation levels. Juicy hops and creamy mouthfeel. This drinks pretty easy for a DIPA and it drinks at the listed 8% abv without any booze kick.
Overall: Imperial Pseudosue. Whats not to love? Toppling Goliath executes this beer as you would expect; a high quality DIPA single hopped with Citra. This is TG's best hoppy beer and the best DIPA coming out of the Great Lakes and Midwest beer region. King Sue will go toe to toe with each and every East Coast style (hazy/juicy) hoppy beer from the likes of Trillium, Treehouse, Hill Farmstead, etc. 1,273 characters4DAloveofSTOUT, Jul 01, 2016

S: HUGE tropical fruit and citrus notes of pineapple, peach, mango, orange, and grapefruit.
T: This stuff is the definition of a juicy hop bomb. Taste matches the aromas well. Notes of tropical and citrus fruits accompanied by a mild hoppy bitterness. Showcases the citra hop extremely well. ABV is barely noticeable.
F: Medium bodied, very smooth, with good carbonation.
O: Honestly, this is hands down the best DIPA I've had. Definitely lives up to the hype. So glad I got to try this fresh. Would easily go through the trouble to get this one again. 761 charactersBeerGuy8315, Jun 26, 2016

Well worth the 2 1/2 hour drive to come home with this beer.  Poured into 2 TG chalice glasses for my wife and I to share.  We were not dissapointed.  The flavor compared to the original PsuedoSue (which I think has great citra hop flavor) doesn't compare.  This screams flavor, amazing citra hop flavor smacking you in the face.  This one is in my top 3 IPAs I've ever tried along with Dinner and Pliny The Elder.  Look forward to trying more of the 22 oz bombers soon. 537 charactersSeanMNCraftBeerLover, Jun 25, 2016

Aroma is pine, mango, pineapple grapefruit and fresh cut grass. Leaves me very excited for my first drink.
Taste leads with tropical fruit and is followed by pine. It finishes with a very pleasant bitterness.
The mouthfeel is perfect for the style it is thin enough to gulp but thick enough to fill the mouth with flavor.
Overall this beer is awesome every bit worth seeking out.

Light yellow, foamy white head.
Big tropical pineapple on the nose follows through on the palate with some of that classic crackery malt that Pseudo Sue also has. But unlike Pseudo, the hops explode here with citrus.
So many other whales were already kicked before we even got through the "21+ hand stamp line," so I'm glad to have been able to try two huge TG brews. 402 charactersSabtos, Apr 04, 2016

No date on the 22oz bomber but I imagine it's not too old, I dig the new label. This beer was poured into a veil brewing company tulip glass and it looks like every other yellow murky juicy haze hop bomb but with an inch of frothy white head. The smell is amazing, I get nothing but blended tropical fruits with more and more candied pineapple notes! I could literally smell this beast all day long and not get tired of it. The taste starts like tropical fruits, the mid palate I get some grapefruit/pine flavors followed by some bready and caramel malts. The beer has a fuller feel but not on the chewy side, and definitely shows the alcohol and bitterness as it warms ( it only warmed because I had the bomber to myself and left it out of the fridge when consuming the first half of the bottle). Overall this is great and I really want to have this beer when it's fresh as can be! Cheers. 997 charactersBEER88, Apr 03, 2016

Poured a not quite clear orange/yellow with nice white head and good lacing as I drank.  Excellent and very strong citrus aroma.  Taste follows, very smooth and clean on the tongue.  The bitter is well balanced with the sweet and there is zero lingering.  OUTSTANDING!  Light to medium mouthfeel.  For my money this lived up to the hype. 429 charactersJamieDuncan, Mar 31, 2016

Nice body to give it a little chewiness.  No alcohol noticed. This one really delivers as one of the best IPAs I've had.  And just when I was really happy with it, the bottom unfiltered OJ looking stuff raised it to another level.  A must have beer.
This one is worth to put into my elite group of perfect 5's.  I really can't think of anything much better.
Thanks to Neil from Iowa for tracking this one down for me in a great trade. 535 charactersbubseymour, Mar 31, 2016

4.31/5  rDev -6.9%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Fortunate enough to have this beer while waiting in line at Other Half this past Saturday. This was the first beer that I've had that was brewed in Iowa and from what I've seen, this may be the best offering to come out of the Hawkeye State. Tropical, deceptively strong, and juicy, this went down easily while having a flavor profile that stuck around for the duration!
Good pour to this as the hue was a golden orange that was cloudy and quite frothy. Lots of melon and tropical fruit in the nose along with a ton of rind and some dankness as well. The head and carbonation were plenty and this was not clear but not cloudy enough to appear unfiltered as well. The strength of this beer was in how well the Citra hops and fruit flavors meshed together, while leaving me wanting more. Carbonated enough, this was dry that only more of this beer could quench my thirst. The alcohol was impossible to taste while there was some grass here to keep this light, in spite of how succulent this turned out to be!
So many IPA's hit you over the head with hops and booze but that wasn't the case here. Melon, papaya, and cantaloupe rind were all that was needed to draw me in here while not having the juice of a Treehouse beer. Dank is the way I love these and if you're a fan of of IPA's that fall into that category, than this would be worth seeking out. Not worth taking lightly but so easy to savor at the same time - this would be the beer that finally puts Iowa on the map! 1,474 charactersJerzDevl2000, Mar 27, 2016

Looks: pours a light straw color with an ample white head. Carbonation is there. Slight haze, but less than I expected. 
Smell:  Passion fruit juice, and overripe pineapple.
Taste: passion fruit juice, and the pineapples dominate, to me, and a slight oj taste in the finish. I detect no alcohol 
Feel: Medium full bodied, with a softer juicy mouthfeel that kind of coats the mouth. Bitterness runs through the second half of the beer, giving it more of a classic IPA finish than some softer beers. Carbonation is evident. 
Overall: I'm not disappointed, and my expectations were sky high. This is the best double IPA I've had, and has some juiciness to it, and an amazing smell. Worth trading for 853 charactersCfred371, Mar 20, 2016

Poured into an IPA glass.  Gorgeous IPA, hazy amber with a gorgeous fluffy white head with great retention and nice lacing.  Head retention could be a bit longer but that's the only mark against the appearance.
Nose is juicy citrus - orange and pineapple.  Light and airy.
Flavor profile follow but is a bit more subdued in its profile than expected.  Bright citrus is huge - grapefruit especially.  But it's a bit more one note than I was hoping.  Great, huge, bitter hoppy profile lingers long and finishes dry on the bittering note.  It's big, it's bitter, it's citrusy.  It's delicious.  
Feel is nice, full body, round, but a bit brash.  The juicy color gives the impression it might be a bit more rounded or velvety than it is.
This is definitely world class, but I was expecting something a bit more special for the perfect 100 it has here. 930 charactersoldn00b, Feb 27, 2016

Citrusy and refreshing, and clean. Piney and a lot of citrus, hits the mouth perfectly and leaves instantly, crisp flavor. I would like to have a redo with this Dinner and Swish as they were all the top 3 that night, and really see if this is as good as i remember. 384 charactersRLVineh, Feb 22, 2016

Do not pass it up if you have the chance to try it. 313 charactersmartinfletwood, Feb 22, 2016

4.5/5  rDev -2.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a cloudy orange-amber color with a solid, one finger broad head, which turns out to be utmost stable while revealing big, spongy bubbles.
Crisp citrus peel settles among flowery apple juice, together with white bread malts and a note of fresh cut grass. Has a mango ripeness to it, adding directly to the complexity of the citrus, while including soothing, flowery qualities among zingy kiwi. A resinous sweetness melts into the malts, creating a truly harmonious, yet aromaful nose.
Has a soft carbonation, present enough to provide a spritzy impact during the finish, which, apart from that, is completely soft on the tongue, producing a mellowing creaminess and an overall great mouthfeel. 
Tastes of a bowl of water, featuring fresh cut grass and a whole lot of juicy citrus and orange chunks. Due to the aqueous quality, fruits have a pleasant mildness to them, which vanishes, as the hops turn more powerful. Fruits turn crispier and a tad dryer then, while respecting the beers world class smoothness throughout, settling atop the rich creaminess. Reveals a fruit entangled malt sweetness after the swallow, slowly but steady transforming into a long lasting, citrus defined dryness. Even the bitter finish gets awesomely soothed by the outstanding mouthfeel, leaving the flavor focus on the fruits, while allowing subtle flavors to cut through during the late flavour transformation from malty to hoppy.
Flavourful and thrilling on the tongue, this one leaves me startled. It drinks like a dipa at the same time as it does not. First of all, the balance and mouthfeel in this are amazing, everything falls into place, citrus rages itself out on the palate leashed by smooth yeast, while no hint of alcohol becomes evident at all. Basically this drinks outstandingly easy. At the same time though, you can tell the intensity of flavors indicates a higher gravity, leading to a palate challenging complexity. Thats about it however, apart from that citrus unfolds playfully and most complex, remaining on the palate till the very end, providing even a certain freshness which lets you keep on drinking. Beautiful. 2,129 charactersaleigator, Jan 29, 2016

I'm glad I've tried it, but now I'm moving on! 317 charactersoldsailor, Jan 24, 2016

A= Orange hue, hazy, looks like sunshine through the morning fog.  Nice thick white head, small bubbled foam, settles to thin cap, lots of sticky lacing.
S= Instantly noticeable tropical hops with a bit of dank resin.  Big whiff gives you a slight hint of toasty malt backbone
T= Tropical and dank, pineapple/mango/papaya.  Only citrus I notice is straight orange juice.  Bit of bitterness.  Smooth and tasty.
M= Light side of moderate carbonation, medium body. 
O= Big and bold tropical hop flavors, worth the effort to get, does not fall short of its world class rating.  Very easy to drink with a manageable ABV. 654 charactersjhavs, Jan 21, 2016

Did not have to take a big whiff as this beer has an incredibly intense tropical smell.  Got to say that after taking a smell my stomach starting to growl like the T-Rex on the bottle. 
Finally time to hit the taste buds!  This is not beer this heaven.  I have had beer and many of the great ones but this is like nothing I have ever had.  So tasty that I wanted to gulp it as though I had not drank it days.  But I came to my senses and decided to savor it and make it last as this may be the last beer I ever drink because how can any beer be better. 760 characterswarrendietrich2001, Jan 13, 2016

Toppling Goliath King Sue pours a cloudy orange color. The head is a bright white inch of foam that recedes slowly leaving nice lacing. The aroma is of passion fruit, mango, kiwi, tangerines, and a hint of floral things. The taste is similar with tons of fruit, and subdued bitterness for that style that really lets the fruit shine. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with a silky texture, and mild carbonation. Overall, this is a world class DIPA that is certainly worth hunting down. 511 charactersKarlHungus, Jan 12, 2016

Slight hazy orange appearance. Citra hops and citrus smell is abundant.  Very juicy tasting.  Tropical and deliscious.  Smooth light malty end with low bitterness.  This is dangerously easy to drink for 8%abv.  Similarities are there with PsuedoSue, but more full bodied.  Overall an excellent DIPA not to be passed up....ever. 368 characterseifster82, Jan 02, 2016

And I needed to try a TG hop whale
A-light orange, off white foam head- looks like a big IPA
S- total orange and pineapple bomb
T- more of the same, I also get a peppery note and a nice underlying bready malt note to balance it just enough
M- spot.fucking.on.
O- the only thing stopping me from giving the full 5 was the fact that I've had IPAs have smells that jump out of the glass just a tad bit better, but this is total nitpicking...absolutely world class double IPA that drinks like a pale ale, astonishing when coupled with the fact that this beer has 100+ IBU...well done, assholes...

Pours a hazy glowing orange with a big, beautiful off-white head. The aroma absolutely pops out of the bottle with big tropical fruits - mango, pineapple, papaya, orange. The taste follows that smell. Pretty thick mouthfeel. 
Surly's Todd the Axeman is my favorite beer, and I feel like this is a slightly more imperial version of that. Really beautiful beer. 471 charactersFargrow, Dec 29, 2015

4.71/5  rDev +1.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Cheers to CJ for hooking me up with this one. Super fresh bomber from the original brewer, none of that half-breed stuff from a few months ago. Poured into a snifter.
A - Nice looking beer. Pours a surprisingly clean, but fairly hazy orange with decent carbonation. No crazy pulpiness a la Julius going on here. Fluffy white head that laces well as the beer goes down.
S - Huge aroma. Big time tropical and citrus notes. Pretty much the ideal nose for the recent tropical IPA craze. Surprisingly at this gravity and IBU, there's nothing unpleasant or astringent about the nose in even the slightest way. Impressive.
T - Oh my damn. This one is up there with the best DIPAs I've ever had. Mango, pineapple, passionfruit, orange, and a whole host of other tropical fruits stomp all over your tongue. Pleasantly bitter, but not as much as you might expect for 100+ IBUs. World class through and through.
M - Medium bodied and crisp. Incredibly drinkable for this gravity. Nothing cloying or astringent about the feel here, which is impressive. 
O - This may be the best DIPA I've ever had. 1,091 charactersNordbier, Sep 25, 2015

Pours hazed golden orange with a wisp of a head that leaves some lacing.
The smell is very fruity - tropical/citric - mango, pineapple, orange, grapefruit. 
The taste of citrus/tropical fruit with backed by sweet bread. Enough malt to give balance to the bitterness while allowing the hop flavor to shine through. Alcohol shows, but not raw. A restrained fruity bitterness lingers.
It just about hits full-bodied. No residual sugars remain on the palate. More crisp than chewy. Smooth despite alcohol bite.
A fruity, hop-forward IPA. Wonderful stuff. I liked it enough to pay another eight bucks for a second ten-ounce pour! 714 charactersjwc215, Aug 26, 2015

It has a finger of foam. Good retention and lacing. The aroma is fantastic. Wonderful tropical fruits. A bit of citrus. I have to say I love citra hops. The flavor is great too, but truth be told, for only 8% ABV, I'm of the opinion the alcohol should be better hidden. Minor complaint... Great feel... Smooth and full bodied. Overall, I'm glad I finally got to try this one. I'd gladly drink it on a regular basis. Still think I prefer the regular Sue though. Cheers! 585 charactersRoamingGnome, Aug 26, 2015

A: crown of white head on top of a hazy orange
S: mercy.  Ridiculously juicy, big almost overripe mango, papaya, and big bready caramel malt too, and an edge of grapefruit peel/pith.  If it was a little more dank, it would be perfect...but as is, it is great.
T & M:  big & heavy & a little boozy.  Nice and sharp bite with the tropical flavored.  Warming.  Just a tad undercarbonated and almost syrupy, but again, I'm nitpicking.
Wish it never stopped...awesome.  Packs a wallop. 515 charactersTaybeh, Aug 25, 2015

4.94/5  rDev +6.7%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5My second time having this beer, first time from the tap. (Disclaimer: This was approximately one week ago.)
Look:  Hazy yellow with a tinge of deep orange-red.
Smell:  Passion fruit comes immediately -- the same as I remembered from having it from the bottle (fresh) about one year ago. Pineapple was the second most predominant note albeit more subtly, followed by a bit of a floral character reminiscent of the lavender found in Pseudo Sue. The hops come through very subtly -- not nearly as intense as I would have expected from a DIPA -- I think they were mostly expressed through the passion fruit and pineapple notes.
Taste:  Heavy on the passion fruit in a very pleasing way. It tasted almost exactly as it smelled but with a definite and very pleasing hoppy aftertaste. As it warmed from about 45deg to room temperature the hops started coming forth a lot more fiercely, giving it a lot more character and spreading out the palette into a full range of sweet and bitter.
Feel:  Very smooth and a touch thicker than most non-dark beers. The King was  very unique in its sticky character, almost like I had a bit of lollipop on my lips, but way better (I don't generally care for lollipops).
Overall:  One of my favorite brews I've ever had, for sure. Definitely a unique beer which in a blind tasting could be hard to pin down as a DIPA, but wouldn't really fit into any other category either. It isn't so sweet and fruity as a fruit beer, but not nearly as intense with the hop presentation as you would expect from a DIPA. If you can find it, drink it! 1,567 charactersMeanderingHermit, Aug 25, 2015

4.02/5  rDev -13.2%look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured from a bomber into a snifter. Look is a hazy golden body topped by 3/4 inch fluffy white head. Smell was citrusy, maybe lemon, some honey sweetness, and some grapefruit. Taste was led by a tropical pineapple and mango citrus, some honey and a subtle bitterness. A little light in the mouth, medium carbonation, not much staying power. Overall this is not a standout in my book, well integrated, but just doesn't have the intensity of flavor that I prefer. 462 charactersOneEye78, Aug 16, 2015

smell-Burst of citrus, with a nice malty backbone that doesn't overpower the gorgeous hops.
Taste-very citrusy, with a noticeable floral quality and honey like sweetness from the malt, almost reminded me of green tea with lemon and honey, but fruitier and frankly just more delicious.
Feel-Medium body, pleasantly bubbly on the tongue, slightly chewy right near the end but then it finishes on the slightly dry side, which contrasts wonderfully with the bright, fruity taste.
Overall-Amazing beer, my favorite Citra hopped beer so far. 658 charactersSteveB24, Aug 13, 2015

S - The nose is just an intoxicating juicy citrus bomb. Clean, doesn't smell overly sweet with a light malt backbone.
T - Oh man... Just a super clean IIPA that isn't overly malty or sweet. Again like the nose, tons of juicy citrus coming at you from all directions. Although, not much hop bitterness going on. 
F - Lighter body and lighter carbonation than I'm used to in a IIPA. Light bodied and low carbonation. Super easy drinking and oh so crushable. The alcohol is hardly noticeable. 
O - I can see why this beer is rated so highly as it's such a citrus bomb. 701 characterscvm4, Aug 09, 2015

4.88/5  rDev +5.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5Poured from a bomber that I'm pretty sure was bottled on 7/17/15.  Consumed on 8/3/15.  Promptly decided to kick my own ass for not drinking this 5 or 6 days ago when acquired in a trade.  Only negative thing I have to say about this beer was that it was only 22oz.  I didn't want it to end and couldn't stop drinking it.  I will caveat my review with the fact that I am an absolute sucker for Citra hopped beers, but this one was outstanding and worth the hype. 
Pours a beautiful orange-ish hue that reminds me of Julius and Green, and that's pretty spectacular company in my book.  The nose on it was an explosion of wave after wave of citrusy goodness.  Took a lot longer than usual just smelling this beer before I was ready to drink it.  The taste doesn't disappoint and follows the nose.  It has the creamy mouthfeel reminiscent of the best NE IPAs, but with a nice medium level of carbonation too.  I just could not stop sipping on this beer until it was gone.  Just a real treat, and before I was halfway through, I was already contacting my trading partner to see if he still had any left!  Fantastic beer. 1,117 charactersNYC-IPAnAPA, Aug 04, 2015

A- Pours a bright and hazy light to medium gold in color with a big, frothy head that forms and retains for a good while. The head of about 2.5 fingers sticks around and leaves a good lace down the side of the glass. The body of the beer is a very bright and effervescent, with bubbles continuously rising. Looks like a good IPA/DIPA should in the glass.
S- The hops come right out of the glass and smack you in the nose. Deep pine flavors are prominent, just like you cut into a fir tree and took a sniff. Under the pine and bitter hop notes, there is a touch of bright citrus scent as well in the form of slight lemon zest.
T- Contrary to the scent, this beer hits the tongue with a slightly sweet malt bitterness before hitting you with the hops. The malts have a touch of honey flavor to them, but mostly have a really delicious, plain barley flavor to them. When the hops move in, the piney flavors in the smell move onto the palate and clean the malts out of the way. The bitterness is not overwhelming or stinging, but it is definitely strong and distinct. The hops wash all over the mouth and take over before the drink ends and linger long after the drink ends.
M- This beer drinks more like a smooth, nitro poured oatmeal stout than a double IPA. It is thick and smooth across the tongue, with a lower carbonation level. There is a touch of alcohol warmth at the back end of the drink as well. There aren't enough words to describe how smooth this beer is, especially when you consider the flavor profile and the style.
Overall, having this as my Toppling Goliath beer has me salivating to try to get my hands on more. The only way to describe this beer is as the smoothest DIPA I have ever had. In addition, the flavor has a good balance of both hops bitterness and malty backbone. Simply delicious! 1,875 charactersboilermakerbrew, Aug 01, 2015

5/5  rDev +8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5The beer comes in a hazy rich dark orange/amber color. A vibrant glowing orange.
The aroma smacks passionfruit, juicy orange, sweet honey dew, ripen peach, tangerine, a touch of pineapple, a touch of herbaceous, a bit of white bready malt.
On the flavor, the beer explodes of fruitiness. An intense attack of honey dew candy/bubblegum, onto passionfruit, juicy peach, sweet tangerine, fruity bubble gum, a light white bready malt, as the onslaught of fruity flavors slows down, the aftertaste leaves pithy grapefruit and herbaceous.
The mouthfeel is medium plus and creamy.
This is 7/17/15 batch is currently my number one DIPA and thus my number one beer. The absurd avalanche of almost artificial fruity flavors is unreal. 728 charactersdar482, Aug 01, 2015

4/5  rDev -13.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4This one was billed as "the best DIPA ever" and "even better than Double Sunshine," so after nearly a year of searching, I was thrilled to be able to try it.
Overall, King Sue was a "pretty good"  beer, though not quite a "great" one in my book. It reminded me a lot of the hype surrounding King Julius and the disappointment that ensued following that release and subsequent tasting. 
What I am finding, though, is that my base standard for exceptional IPA's from Vermont has ruined my palate for beers that others consider fantastic and amazing. 
I am, however, glad to have tried King Sue to satisfy my curiosity and to be able to display a bottle with a T-Rex on it as part of my collection. 698 charactersrodmanfor3, Jul 29, 2015

Juicy aroma: tropical and citrus fruit, laced with a dank herbal tone that doesn't quite dominate.
Flavor follows: it's what you'd expect for a Citra DIPA. Very juicy; green and dank.
Relatively thick on the palate, and a little hot and syrupy. 324 charactersRoguer, Jul 28, 2015

Looks great. Golden orange with great lacing and retention. Smell of tropical fruit. Mango?
Taste is a tropical fruit punch to the gums. Sweet. Hardly any discernible alcohol. Just enough bite from the hops but a big malt backbone balances things perfectly. This is great. Maybe the best double I've had. But I do lean towards the sweater more balanced IPAs as opposed to the hop bombs. 463 charactersZaximus, Jul 28, 2015

While it is certainly a solid DIPA, I feel some of TG's standard lineup (Intergalactic Warrior, Zeelander) are of higher quality than this beer.  Glad I got to try it, but not something I feel is worth a special trip out to Decorah to pick up. 286 charactersthebigredone, Jul 24, 2015

Poured into my darkness snifter this brew has a formidable white head atop a golden orange color that is fairly clear. Aroma is big time citra. Dank, with that tropical mango, tangerine aroma. I could smell this all day. After a few drinks...I could drink this all day too. This is so good. Citra rules the day. It's all citra but not bitter at all. Malt bill is clean and complements the citra perfectly. Just the right amount of carbonation with a bit of warming in the belly. . I didn't think a beer could be better than regular Sue. This is the one. I need more!!! 643 charactersdeebo, Jul 06, 2015

A: Slightly hazed bright orange body, ample head of fine off-white foam. Good retention and lacing. The color is just what I look for in a hop-driven DIPA. Very nice.
S: Amazingly aromatic, with bright tropical and citrus fruit notes positively jumping out of the glass. Pineapple, lime, mango, and grapefruit. Nothing but luscious fresh hops - flawless.
T: Opens with the decadent hop fruitiness of the nose, followed by a fairly quick, mildly bitter, and surprisingly flavorless finish. It's impressively easy to drink, but the flavor just doesn't deliver the same intensity as the nose.
M: Medium bodied with soft, creamy carbonation. Could have used a bit more liveliness, but pretty good.
O: Tremendous aroma, and certainly delicious, but not quite world class due to the disparity between taste and smell. Absolutely worth tracking down to experience, but not one I'll be seeking out in the future.

Srs. 
Hazy rich yellow gold in the glass with 2 fingers of thick frothy head. Super dank nose with a bunch of citrus rind ...maybe dried citrus rind? I dunno, that's what comes to mind. Lime and pineapple stand out a bit. 
Oh my, I'm going to need a sec here. ;-) So much sweet, juicy, tangy citrus backed with just enough of those nice toasted malt flavours. Tropical fruits are there as well, mainly pineapple, a bit of bitter yellow grapefruit, maybe a little sweet fresh grass. Just the slightest hint of alcohol would be my only gripe if I had to make one, but it's barely there. Medium-full body, medium-low creamy smooth carbonation. 
I admit that the nose, while very good, didn't exactly make it move like Pseudo Sue did. Made me a bit worried, but it was all for naught. Stellar beer. Srs, bro. Srs. 824 charactersRutager, Jun 15, 2015

When held up to the sun, obviously, it does not penetrate.  This is the best body I have witnessed in an imperial IPA.  The white head  is grand, pillow puffy, and dense.  Tacky curtains.  
Smell:  I had Pseudo Sue last night, and the smell in this is multiplied by two.  A touch of dankness, hiding behind an aroma of candied tropical fruit, easy hops, and some sweet grapefruit.
Taste:  Bitter up front.  Candied tropical fruit, light hops, and sweet grapefruit rounds everything out.  The finish is smooth with light sweetness.
Feel:  Silky, smooth, feathery lather throughout. 
Overall - Impressive. 667 charactersmabermud, Jun 12, 2015

3.98/5  rDev -14%look: 5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4Spring 2015 batch (consumed 5/13/15, and then again on 5/15/15):
Appearance is terrific. Murky honey gold with a paper white that laces well from start to finish. No complaints here.
Nose seems to take a similar direction as past batches. A lot of citrus and juicy bits, but this one is counteracted by an abrasive bitterness and a hint of alcohol. It's obvious here that this is not the same beer that received such deserved acclaim in the past.
I won't deny that this is delicious. Very drinkable and fruit-forward. But it severely lacks the intense, juicy citrus qualities that made previous vintages so memorable. It's in that same wheelhouse, just not nearly as vibrant. There is also kind of an awkward finish... it cleans up too quick and the only thing left is hop abrasion. 785 charactersramay86, Jun 03, 2015

Finger of head diminishes to a light filmmupon sipping.  Nose brings pineapple, orange and sweet clover to mind.  Taste is interesting in that the citrusy flavors meld beautifully with the piney and floral hop flavors right up front - which to my palate is different than most DIPAs that seem to be citrus forward followed with a hoppy finish.  Result here is fantastic.  As a result the finish isn't at all tounge scraping like so many others.  TG nails it Again. 531 charactersmschantz, May 29, 2015

Right away u can tell this is good. Appearance in the glass is one of the best I've seen!
Nose is an amped up sue, fantastic.
Taste follows the nose. Incredible brew, I dunno if 22 oz is enough.
Some people mentioned it being boozy, I don't get very much booze at all, I actually find this super refreshing.
Overall it lived up to my expectations. If it was easy to get I'd get it much more but pseudosue makes a fantastic substitute

3.97/5  rDev -14.3%look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4Bottle shared by Will yesterday, thanks so much dude.
This one pours a dark orange-ish, with a quarter inch head, and a little bit of lacing.
This one smells suuuper Citra-ey, lots of orange, pine, and grapefruit, with just a hint of booze.
I never had the original King Sue, so I can't really comment on how this is compared to the version(s) brewed by Mike Saboe. I can say that it is delicious- but unfortunately, a slight let down compared to what I expected. The booziness is a bit more present than I would've expected, but with a very tasty Citra presence that eschews cattiness for intense citrusy fruitiness.
This is medium bodied, with a crisp and juicy mouthfeel, along with a moderate level of carbonation.
This isn't quite the King I was expecting, but it's still a very tasty IPA nonetheless. 811 charactersGreesyFizeek, May 25, 2015

Pours a deep golden hazy body with slight sedimentation, a white 2" head rises and reduces slowly, leaving a layer of white foam. 
Aromas of heavy sharp resin, pine, citrus, some tropical fruit as it warms, pretty heavy malt aromas of caramel. On the tongue comes pine, grapefruit, a resinous bite on the finish, sitting on a pretty heavy malt backbone that becomes more apparent as it warms. Mouthfeel is medium carbonation, medium-heavy body, less refreshing than others.. 
Overall a solid DIPA, nothing that blows me away but on par with other midwest DIPAs. Reminds me of hopslam. 679 charactersgcamparone, May 24, 2015

Pours a huge, foamy 3 finger white head with endless retention. Beer is a slightly cloudy pale orange. Lacing is thick, messy and layered with crazy stick. Perfect save for the color.
Nose reeks of dank, citrus and pine. Like a fresh cut grassy meadow that's been saturated with citrus fruit juice. Clean, simple and very aromatic.
Opens citrus. Notes of pineapple, starfruit, grapefruit, and other tropical aromas that really get deeper, sweeter and more vibrant as they stay on the palate. Middle injects a touch of sap and juicy hop bitterness. Ends with a big hop bite balanced by still more tropical fruit. Rather clean finish. This just keeps getting better and better the more you drink.
Light to medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Smooth with a slight bit of bubbles going down and soft and drinkable going down. Accented finish with a mellow but lingering aftertaste. Drinks like its 5-6%. 
Addictive is what I would call this beer. With the way TG keeps churning out these world class, high abv. beers, they might be making a push for the best brewery around! 1,170 charactersSpeedwayJim, May 24, 2015

4.91/5  rDev +6%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75I got this from my new friend, Omensetter, who leaves in proximity to the brewery! I never thought I would get a chance at this beer and he seriously hooked me up! And I love the graphics on the label with the T-Rex I'm in love!
A - Bright honey-orange color. Incredibly opaque capturing all of the light in it's brilliantly dry hopped body with a HUGE, fine white head and crazy strong lacing.
S - Extremely strong hop fragrance with tons of tropical fruit that you would ever want all packed into one glass. Mostly a papaya, pineapple, and mango mixture that I can barely describe the awesomeness. Could smell it as I opened the bottle. Definitely one of the best smelling beers ever!
T - Amazing hop flavor with a full fruit bouquet hop character with lots of tropical fruit, citrus, some pine, and dank resin hops to round out this tremendous beer. There is some malt and ale yeast but very much like a mango, citrus hop soup. The bitterness seems quite mild for so many hops but still very good. This is clearly a Citra lovers feast and if you don't like the bite of some of the other Citra DIPAs out there this will probably be your new favorite.
M - Medium mouth-feel with medium carbonation. Sits very well on the palate. More like a regular IPA than a DIPA but it is very easy to drink the entire bomber and keep wanting more.
Overall, this beer is definitely one of the best DIPAs. I think I'm biased and my palate has already known too many amazing beers to really send this one to the very top of the list but I would definitely spend $15 a bottle again! This brew is absolutely amazing for every hop head out there that loves tropical flavored hops. This beer went down fast and I look forward to trying it again next year!

Hint of orange in the nose with a full body IBU taste and an incredible Finish. Decent body and nice hazy color. I tried this along side a Permanent Funeral by 3 floyds that i gave equal reviews and the King is justly named. 326 characterstapperm, May 14, 2015

I got the very last pour, so it was coming out of a pitcher that was used to let the foam settle after the keg kicked. Lots of lacing and a persistent head. Aroma is citrus and tropical fruits, grass, and some bready malts once you cut through the Citra onslaught. Taste is a light citrus/tropical sweetness initially followed by moderate grass and citrus peel bitterness on the finish. Medium body, very creamy texture (thought this might have been because the keg kicked, but others seem to agree), average to soft carbonation, dry finish with a nice lingering bitterness. 685 charactersSierraFlight, Mar 03, 2015

From a bomber into a snifter
Citra hop exclusive
APPEARANCE: Pours a two finger, medium looking, creamy white head with very good retention. Hazy light amber orange in color with medium-low levels of carbonation. Head slowly fades to a full cap and sticks to the sides of the glass. A full wisp remains until the end and leaves lots of nice lacing as the glass empties. Good looking. 
SMELL: Pure citra hops. Citrus fruit, lemon zest, honeydew melon, pineapple, and just a light touch of soapy notes as well. Good, and not overly soapy like some citra-only beers can be. 
TASTE: Really good. All citra hop. Some caramel and citrus fruits up front with more hops and bitterness at the swallow. Big and lingering aftertaste of lemon zest, citrus oranges, bitter grapefruit and honeydew melon sweetness as well. Hop bitterness lingers with some citrus fruit flavors. Not much soap here compared to the nose. 
PALATE: Medium body and medium carbonation. Creamy on the palate, goes down smooth and finishes a bit dry. 
OVERALL: Really good. Loved this stuff. Luckily the soapy qualities citra hop can often impart on an IPA were minimal here, and the flavors and aromas worked really well. Was happy to try this and would gladly drink more. This one was more citrus heavy than the spicier Sosus, but both brews were top class. Thanks again Doopie! 1,505 charactersJeffo, Nov 09, 2014

4.25/5  rDev -8.2%Pours a hazy dark amber in the glass with half a finger of head and some pronounced lacing along the rim.
The nose is hard to explain.  Being a single citra hop beer I was expecting juicy orange/grapefruit scents with a bit of floral mixed in with malts.  However, the fruitiness isn't that pronounced with this beer and there is a slight urine scent that I can only explain as some pine and earth tones(perhaps a bit of revenge from Sue).  Compared to other citra DIPA's that I have had it is a bit strange.
The taste is even a bit more unexpected.  I enjoyed Psuedo Sue, but King Sue is a bit harsher on the palate.  The wonderful juicy fruity flavors of the citra hop is muddled with some piney earthy tastes.  There is a a hop bite on the back of the throat trumpeting the bitterness that goes along with this beer.  I almost flashed to a mixture of Pliney with a citra hop beer experiment.  I know that there are a lot of folks who are head over heals for this beer, but the presentation of the citra hops are not showcased in this instance.
It is an enjoyable/drinkable beer.   And as far as DIPA's go it is a good example of a hoppy high alcohol beer.  I just missed the sweet juicy fruit taste associated with a citra DIPA.  I traded KRBC Citra for this beer and there isn't any date on the bottle so I don't know the pedigree, but I would buy it again and I would like to do a side by side with Citra. 1,413 charactersRutgersEng, Oct 15, 2014

The beer is yellow and moderately hazy with a white cap. Like Sosus, huge tropical fruit notes. Wonderfully fresh and über hoppy with a subtle, bready malt character in support. Medium bitterness, finishing clean with lingering juicy hop tones. It has been fun to watch the IPA / DIPA style evolve over the last several years. King Sue is without question a world class beer, on par with my favorites from Alpine, Hill Farmstead and the like. 536 charactersHuhzubendah, Sep 22, 2014

A: Pours a hazy orange-tinted golden color, opaque with three fingers of foamy off-white head which slowly deflates.  Leaves behind quite a bit of sloppy lacing.  Superb retention.  (4.75)
S: Floral and grassy notes up front, along with mango, lemon, biscuit and bread, and blood orange.  (4.5)
T: More citrus forward than the nose, though the pale malt and floral notes still feature, along with some sweetish malt and tropical notes (esp. mango).  A long, lingering and moderately bitter finish with full flavor.  It has the same sweetness that Sue does, which is a bit more than ideal for the style.  (4.5)
M: Medium body and medium-light, soft carbonation. (4.5)
O: Pretty drinkable, with nice hoppy flavor which is balanced by the malt.  A bit higher bitterness and sweetness than ideal for me, though.  I’d rank the TG IPAs as: Sosus > King Sue >> PseudoSue. (4.5) 924 characterspmarlowe, Sep 17, 2014

4.38/5  rDev -5.4%Fresh bottle in trade from Joe basically as an extra. Huge thanks. Pours super murky yellow colored with a big fluffy white head. Really ugly to be honest. Aroma of sweet hop nectar, pineapples, pine needles, dank mustiness. Flavor is lots and lots of sweet pineapples balanced alongside huge bitter pine. Pretty chewey and dry, medium plus carbonation, crisp refreshing finish. Really nice DIPA on the bitter end of the spectrum. Quite the hype monster, and this is excellent but doesn't live up to that. Doesn't hold a candle to Pseudo for me, which is saying something because this is very good. Definitely worth getting but don't bend over backward for it. 660 charactersBMMillsy, Sep 13, 2014

5/5  rDev +8%Aroma: Loads of grapefruit, pineapple, mango, dank hops, and a little pine. Absolutely amazing smell to this beer!
Appearance: Super hazy yellow, resembles pineapple juice with a little bit of a glowing bright orange hue to it, extremely fluffy head is left on the pour that stays for a long time, leaves amazing lacing on the glass, one of the best looking beers I have seen!
T: I'm blown away by the taste of this beer, loads of mango, pineapple, some buttering grapefruit, a little bit of pine and the right amount of bitterness, and it is all so well balanced. You get a slam of hops then it begins to transition to a lovely crisp light finish that is also very smooth, all the flavors play their own role and none are overpowered by another, truly amazing flavor profile!
Palate: Light crisp, smooth, and refreshing, finishes a little dry and the flavor does linger too much leaving you craving for more!
Overall: This is the best DIPA out right now IMO 962 charactersKnowYourCraft, Sep 09, 2014

S - Smells of intense pine resin, tropical fruits, wet grass, more pine needles and a bit of doughy pale malt.
T - Starts off with lots of pine and tropical fruit - mainly grapefruit and mango - quickly being joined by the fresh cut grass and some chewy pale malt. Finish is quite bitter, lingering long after the finish.
M - Medium body with moderate carbonation. Smooth, bitter feel from start to finish. Tons of bitterness to go around.
O - Hard to say this lived up to the "hype" even tho it was an excellent DIPA. I can't wait to visit these guys next year. 718 charactersorangesol, Sep 07, 2014

2015 batch - lowish carb gives it a full mouthfeel, but almost in a heavy, less drinkable way. The citra flavor is nice and the aroma is a bit tampered down. The color is the nicest part, but the aroma and flavor fall slightly flat. 256 charactersHerky21, Sep 05, 2014

4.37/5  rDev -5.6%Pours like diluted orange juice with a fluffy head. Beautiful beer. Definitely get Citra on the nose. Tangerines, navel oranges, hint of melon coming through. Not as bold of an aroma as I expected, though. Flavor is sweet citrus fruits and some noticeable booze. Not an insane amount, but I really feel the level of booze detracts from the beer, cutting the hop character. Mouthfeel is excellent with the flavor lingering on the buds, and quite a full body, too. Expected a lot more from this beer. It's still awesome, just not as good as I anticipated. Would love to give it a go next time they brew it. 604 charactersjbwimer, Sep 05, 2014

Heavy citra brings on notes of orange, mango, pineapple and peach with undertones of floral notes.  Not much else here as the citra steals the show.  The taste pretty much matches the nose.  Straight citra amplified to the nth degree, I have not had a more juicy beer.  The hops are obviously all late additions as they don't give off much bitterness at all.  Mouthfeel is medium with moderate carbonation.  This beer is an experience.  Very drinkable for the ABV and definitely worth giving a try. 627 charactershomebrew311, Aug 30, 2014

3.55/5  rDev -23.3%Many thanks to kenzilka007 for bringing me some of this storied nectar from the vaults of Decorah.  22 oz. bomber split with my wife. 
Pour is liquid orange milk with plenty of carbonation, less than unfiltered, this was probably reverse filtered to add sediment. Nose is plenty of tropical fruit, very sweet, plenty of citrus. Makes my mouth water, but just a little. Less than a gusher, more than regular moistness. 
I expect King Sue to reach out and caress me intimately, and to my disappointment, there is neither hand nor fingers creping out of the glass. This could have been brewed in the Bahamas, as the fresh fruit parade continues off of the nose. Mango, pineapple, a strong note of papaya, others peek out of the froth. Tons of sweetness swallows the mid-palate, along with a kind, gentle handshake of bitterness. A touch astringent. Mouthfeel is the high point here, thick & luscious, perhaps unique amongst the current crop of IPAs. Half a bomber? That’ll do, Alfred. That’ll do. 
A good beer, but I’m digging hard to try to figure out what the craze is about. Give me a pint of the magnificent regular Sue any day. 1,139 charactersmaximum12, Aug 28, 2014

5/5  rDev +8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Appearance: Hazy as hell. An unpasteurized orange juice with a half finger of fluffy head. Nice lacing. Gorgeous beer.
Aroma: You know this is a KING SUE when you smell it. I have been fortunate enough to get regular growler fills of fresh Pseudo Sue whenever I want when I cross the border into Wisconsin. Pseudo Sue is one of my favorite beers and the smell of it is an unquestionable one. Huge tropical notes of mango, papaya, cantaloupe, citrus, and lemon. A wonderful balance of sour and sweet.
Taste: The taste follows the same balance as the nose, except that everything is cranked up a notch. It's almost like chewing on a lemon and strawberry starburst at the same time. My only discrepancy would be that it is a little too juicy and could use a little more carb to clean and tighten the flavor. It is a juicy grapefruit/orange juice perfection. I still think scream and abrasive are slightly more balance iipa's. Great beer though! I am being very picky. 966 charactersWynnDavis, Aug 26, 2014

Smell is mango, orange, maybe some peach and pineapple, a bit of banana???  Pine needle, some bready malt, a bit of sweetness in the nose aswell
Taste is nice, not as impressive as the nose but still great, lots of tropical and citrus, a big pine and a bit of a astringent bite, some nice sweet malt underneath, grapefruit bitterness in the finish
Mouthfeel is medium full, a bit coating for a DIPA, Dry....  Very dry
Well this is a great, even amazing DIPA...  Is it worth the trouble to get it, well I guess that is up to the individual...  For me though I think I would rather just run down to the store and get many of the DIPAs available in 6ers and 4 packs that I can get for cheaper and any time I want.  
IF I ever saw it I would buy it though without batting a eye, great DIPA! 965 charactersnickapalooza86, Aug 23, 2014

4/5  rDev -13.6%First bottled batch, bottled 1 day prior to review. (Note: I had this on tap twice previously and thought it was far better so perhaps the first bottled batch was a bit off…still great though)
Appearance: Very hazy/murky orange, yellow hue, absolutely the murkiest DIPA I’ve drank (almost makes Heady Topper seem clear). Good head and lacing.
Aroma: Great mango, tropical fruits and citrus layered over some slight oniony & vegetal aroma. Very similar to Pseudo Sue but a bit less fruit forward…a little more dank and slightly vegetal. 
Taste: Very dry and bitter, possibly a little too dry and bitter. Fruity & citrusy but I get much less in the flavor than in the aroma. Flavor is good, but not near as impressive as the aroma
Mouthfeel: Pretty Good, sort of velvety/creamy….and nicely resinous…maybe a little over-carbonated.
Don’t get me wrong this is an excellent DIPA to be sure, but it’s not a world class beer like Pseudo Sue is. It’s also not quite on par with Heady or Pliney, but it’s definitely a top 20 DIPA. However, I definitely prefer the baby brother (Pseudo Sue) to this. 1,114 charactersmillertime416, Aug 22, 2014

On tap at Coopers Tavern in Madison. Looks like a pint of OJ. Fresh pineapple fruity smell. Tastes so awesome. Lots of fresh mango grapefruit. Made me smile instantly upon tasting. Delicious!
From 8/22/14
2nd rating: first bottling of it. Still as good as ever. Bumping it up to a 5 rating because I can’t stop smiling. This beer makes me so happy. 363 characterskkleu357, Jul 07, 2014

It poured a equally cloudy yellow with a nice head and fruity nose.
Taste is hops everywhere but yet it is smooth and subtle.  How did they achieve this.  I enjoyed every sip.  Competition is very stiff in the new fresh hopped tropical arena and Toppling Goliath has several champions 341 charactersdaledeee, May 27, 2014

The best way to describe this beer is "Concentrated Pseudo Sue". 
It was a hazy yellow but almost more so than regular Sue. There wasn't much carbonation and it had a sticky mouth-feel. 
The taste was a sweet citra hop bomb. There wasn't a lot of bitterness but rather a really powerful citrus, bready hop flavor. Very smooth and drinkable but not quite as smooth as regular Sue.
Overall an exceptional beer but I would still rather have the regular Sue. 499 charactersmjpolzin, May 11, 2014

A - Cloudy golden apricot with a 1.5  finger head. Head retention is pretty good and there are large blobs of lacing all over the glass. 
S - Smell is big on fresh scents of tropical sweet juicy hops. Plenty of mango, pineapple, and passion fruit.  Some nice sweet honey and bread malt to balance it out. Must drink!
T - Hops, tropical, hops, citrus, hops everywhere! Rich tangerine, grapefruit, mango, pineapple. The flavor is so intense! Sweet and bready malts show up with some mild alcohol warmth on the finish. A slight pine and grapefruit bitter finish. 
M - Big medium mouthfeel with excellent carbonation. Very sticky and intense hoppiness!
O - One of TGs best IIPAs. Rarely hits distro, but can be traded for.
2017 Update. I have had this in bottles over the past two years and it continues to be a favorite of mine. I will always buy it when I see it. 888 charactersRi0, May 07, 2014

4.59/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a leaky growler into a Prairie Teku glass. Reviewed from notes.
Appearance: A hazy orange, yellow amber with a white head that leaves particularly spotty lacing.
Smell: Loads of citrus, tropical fruits.
Taste: This beer is more like drinking mango puree than any other beer I've had. Everything about the taste screams mango-bomb. I've never understood "tropical fruit" flavors in a beer until I tasted this. Papaya plays background behind the mango, and creamy malts accentuate the mango flavors. Bitter but not unbearably so, with a little bit of pine.
Mouthfeel: Low carbonation, but that isn't the fault of the beer, just of the leaking growler. Very sticky, and lingers quite a while. Will likely re-review when the replacement growler arrives.
Overall: There are a million "very good" IPAs out there. Elevated, Enjoy By, Double Sunshine, Heavy Machinery, and many others. Flavors are solid but nothing particularly unique or interesting is going on to elevate them above the countless other IPAs doing precisely the same thing. But there are a few that transcend above merely "very good" and are truly "exceptional." This is one such beer. By going full-on mango, this beer really stands out in a crowd of IPAs. Kudos on another winner, Toppling Goliath. 1,277 charactersWTKeene, May 01, 2014

Holy smokes was this excellent on draft at DLD.  Incredible scent jumps out of the glass, and the taste actually delivers on that smell where so many do not. Just resiny enough but still slick. Looks like a hazy golden glass of juice. Top notch. A little boozy on the finish as it warms. 409 charactersPHBoiler, May 01, 2014

Appearance: Super muddy orange-tinged gold. So hazy. Head is bright-white, clumoy, and dense. Big sticky notches and chunks of lacing. Moderate retention. Decent carbonation. 
Smell: Hyper tropical. Loaded with pineapple and mango. Some grapefruit pith and a touch of peach. A bit of pine layered in the back. Soft powdery yeast throws some very light fruity esters. Bready, but mildly so. Some mild caramelization. A bit of toasted pale malt. Tropical explosion. Relatively balanced. 
Taste: A weird pithy woody bitterness through the back. Smack of mango, peach, and pineapple right up front. Some nice balancing malt sweetness. Pale malt sweetness. A bit bready. Some undercooked biscuit. Hops are hyper tropical. Pineapple. A touch of pin needle. Restrained bitterness. So much peach. Almost like peach rings. Lingering bitterness. Mild push of yeast and esters throughout. So fruity. 
Mouthfeel: Creamy almost with a moderate carbonation. Clean sip. 
Overall: Probably the best Sue.
Tropical without being too much. A bit sweet and a true testament to Citra. Well played. 1,129 charactersGoblinmunkey7, Apr 26, 2014

A- Hazy golden honey, three-finger head in part because of growler pour. White head with a slight vanilla tone. Head partially sticks to glass as retention happens somewhat quick. Goes from three-finger to large lacing in two minutes. Murky looking
S- Not much more fruity than norm pseudo Sue, but there is more. But not a crazy amount like I thought going into this. Mango, passion fruit all over the place, grapefruit, citrus, etc. Very dense and dank smelling with citrus. 
T- This is where it puts pseudo to rest. Next to perfect Citra hop blowing up all over the place. Prob best Citra and most use out of it. So much tropical fruit gushing out of this. It orgasms your mouth; really that good. Nice minimal use of piney hop characteristic. 
M- Creamy, sort of like Zeelander here. Perfect amount of carb; but creamy is the best way to put this one. 
O- Shocker, TG crushes another one; congrats Iowa... you are pushing craft forward 971 charactersgueuzedreg, Apr 25, 2014

M: Thick and full bodied in IPA/DIPA terms. Perfect touch of carbonation gives it a really creamy feel.
O: Didn't know if it would live up to the hype, but this is truly in the elite DIPA class for me. Younger, Double Citra, and maybe Abrasive are about the only that come to mind that I might choose first. Really outstanding stuff. 670 charactersbrydeen, Apr 24, 2014

The beer pours a hazy copper color, hues of apricot and orange, thick and cloudy with a soapy white head, settling at a nice 2 fingers despite a vigorous pour that has very nice retention and leaves behind plenty of sticky lace behind. The aroma is a huge statement of grapefruit, tangy, juicy and bitter, showcasing the bitter peel but also the sweeter juicy flesh. Piney resin also is apparent with bright tropical fruits of pineapple and mango, slightly floral with a subtle touch of sweet alcohol. The flavors are impeccable, beautiful grapefruit flavor, juicy, fresh, tangy and bitter, all at once, tons of tropical fruit that the nose lead on jumps out on the tongue as well, mango, pineapple, passionfruit, light lemon zest that brings out the floral character that is not without light sappy pine flavors and some earthy bitterness, perhaps an indicator of the malt as well. The mouthfeel is superb, it's lively yet creamy, soft yet zippy, filling, coats the mouth well, feels juicy and finishes with a prefect dry bite, but not punishingly so, just enough for me to want another sip.
Verdict: A masterclass. Easily one of the most enjoyable IPAs I've ever tasted and one of the best beers I've ever tasted. It's bright, delicate, juicy, pungent, balanced, resinous and sticky without being taxing. Everything is in harmony and it showcases how juicy and fruity hops can be without dominating bitterness and astringent undertones. Kudos to Toppling Goliath for this one, a true indicator of their abilities. 1,585 characterskevanb, Mar 29, 2014

S-Aroma literally explodes out of the glass. All Citra hops here. One of the most formidable aromas I have had in terms of pure hoppiness. Tropical fruit juice explosion. Absolutely legendary.
T-Puréed tropical fruits in unlimited quantities. Pineapples, nectarines, orange, grapefruit, tangerine, clementine, mango, melon with a grassy finish. Citra-hop palate melter. Finishes with just enough breadiness. So much goddamn Citra!
M-Dry yet juicy. Resiny. Flavor lingers forever. Perfect bitterness and carbonation. I need more than these samples. I need a full keg. I need it now.
O/D-My number one beer to try at the 2014 EBF. It was without a doubt the best beer there and will receive a perfect rating. I had about 8 samples of this. The flavor is simply perfect. Sad to think I will probably never have this again. 861 charactersVelvetExtract, Mar 23, 2014

Glass Used: Tulip
Appearance: A cloudy orange-gold body, enough so that you cannot see through it .With a light source to the side or behind the glass, the color glows a brilliant honey color. The head was a fluffy white which dissipated leaving ample lace behind. A beautiful DIPA.
Smell: A brilliant bright citrus punch to the nose - grapefruit, orange-tangerine mix, some honeydew melon, a bit floral, lots of pine-resin hoppy aroma. 
Taste: Tropical and citrus flavors blast through with a burst of hops following right behind it. The hops do fade quickly with minimal bitterness. 
Mouthfeel: Thick feel with a dry finish. Medium carbonation.
Overall: Thanks to Pintofbrown for sending me a growler of this fantastic DIPA. I really enjoyed PseudoSue so I wanted to try this one. Not disappointed. Pretty tasty DIPA from TG. 891 charactersdarthvohn, Mar 19, 2014

4.74/5  rDev +2.4%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75On tap at Toppling Goliath's taproom. 12oz pour in an unlabeled chalice today, 3/8/2014.
App- Looks like a beer mimosa. Super hazy, unfiltered orange body, fairly minimal &lt;1 finger white head that dissipates quickly. Some ring lacing the glass as the beer goes down. Honestly looks as close to orange juice with pulp as you can get.
Smell- So juicy. Lots of freshly squeezed orange, pineapple and passion fruit. This is citra at its best. Nicely balanced out by a bready malt backbone.
Flavour- Phenomenal. Juicier than regular sue for sure. So much citra going on. Orange, pineapple, tropical fruits balanced a bit (but way less balanced than regular sue! Which is saying something) by the sweet pale malts. Finish is a nice resinous grassy bitterness that isn't overwhelming. This is one of the best DIPAs to ever come out of the midwest, even if its not the most complex and interesting DIPA I've ever had- it's just so juicy and dank which makes it unique in its own right.
Mouthfeel- Medium bodied, a bit thinner than it should be for a DIPA, but this is still just so juicy and creamy that I can overlook that aspect. Nice dry finish that is a bit bitter but certainly not overwhelmingly so. It is definitely a lot less bitter than other comparable double IPAs. Very easy to drink, dangerously enough.
Overall- This is Toppling Goliath's newest winner. It's like a single hop citra Heady Topper/Abrasive, and wipes the floor with these beers. Abner and Double Sunshine are both fantastic beers in their own right due to their relative complexity, but this is well up there with them. Try to get this if you can. Its a shame they weren't filling growlers of this stuff. 1,682 charactersStevedore, Mar 09, 2014

Really excited to have this and side by side it with pseudo even though they are different styles
A - This beer is absolutely gorgeous, looks unfiltered and brilliantly lemony yellow wheat looking
S - This is one of the best smelling IPA's I have had the pleasure of burying my nose in… citrus bomb that is brilliantly balanced with sweet and bitter smells with the hops coming through at the end. Orange, mango, passion fruit, pineapple wow
T - Definitely the best IPA that has touched my lips.. may never be topped until TG brews another masterpiece. Citrus bomb taste with a bitter finish that dries the mouth quite a bit. Tons of orange, mango, pineapple coming thru on this beer and I wish I could have one every morning/night
M - Very creamy smooth and delicious with dryness on the finish
O - This is hands down the best DIPA ever brewed? It knocked Abrasive and Heady out of the park… pretty incredible
TG is definitely putting out some of the best beers in the world.. 1,071 charactersdrmcleod10, Mar 09, 2014

5/5  rDev +8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Simply put, this is the perfect IPA. 
Bright yellow/orange in color. Sticky lacing, 1.5 finger head....yada yada yada.
The smell, and taste... I've used the expression "bursting with citrus" before, but this takes it to another level. Fresh squeezed clementines and grapefruit. It's difficult to explain balance in an IPA like this, but when you get a taste of it, you'll understand. It just dances in your mouth. Unbelievable stuff.
Mouthfeel is thick, slick, and held together by the perfect level of carbonation.
I wish I could rate this beer a 110. Please make this again Toppling Goliath. Unbelievable stuff. 617 characterskdmcguire10, Mar 04, 2014

Pours a completely opaque bright yellow orange, with two fingers of frothy, foamy stark white head. Excellent sticky lacing throughout. I simply cannot get over the sheer brilliance of the body on this... look like orange juice. Smell is bright citra hops full of grapefruit, tangerine, and clementines, with a touch of dank fresh hop and some characteristic peppercorn. Has an earthiness to it which I have never encountered in citra before, expect a touch in Hill Farmstead Double Citra, and I'm loving it. The taste is... stunning. Unbelievably juicy and fresh, bursting with fresh squeeze orange juice, tangerines, and melon. There is honestly no malt profile to speak of. Body is incredibly juicy and refreshing, with the malt providing a fluffy backbone for the citra to thrive, but not contributing any real flavors. No trace of alcohol.
Quite simply, this is best double IPA I've ever had. Please make this again Toppling Goliath. 1,079 characterscfrances33, Mar 03, 2014
