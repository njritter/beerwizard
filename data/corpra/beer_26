4.8/5  rDev +3.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75To smell Morning Wood is almost as pleasant as waking up with it.  Strong wafts of vanilla, coffee, pancake syrup, and marshmallow - an amazing nose as it tradition from Funky Buddha!  It pours black and viscous out of the bottle with a nice cocoa, tan foam head that recedes fairly quick.  The taste is delicious.  Maply syrup with coffee roast and it is a sweet beer but never cloying as the subtle heat from the barrel prevents it from being too sweet. It is very drinkable. Not motor oil viscosity but FB lists this beer as a porter while it can easily be a stout and nobody would flinch.  Swirling it around it the glass, you can see how oily it is and it clings on the glass.  World class is deserved! 707 charactersJAStheAce, May 15, 2017

Very dark brown, nearly black liquid with minimal foam head upon pour.  There's only a ring of foam around the edge of glass as you drink it.  Smell is rich with maple and chocolate especially, but there was some coffee and bourbon in there too.  The taste is very maple forward with dark chocolate, mild coffee and even a hint of smokey bacon.  A lot of things going on.  The feel is the only (relative) downside to this beer.  It's a bit thin, although it still does have some stickiness to it.  
My favorite Funky Buddha beer without a doubt. 580 characterseifster82, Apr 16, 2017

Needless to say it met and exceeded all expectations.
Pours a dark black with thin mocha head.
Aroma is bourbon, coffee, bacon smokiness and maple (slight).  Damn enticing though.
The taste is fantastic.  Bourbon hits you first, but taste buds are quickly washed with coffee, a little bacon and on the back end maple.   I love the layered approach in this flavor profile.   Almost gave it a 5.0 but the booziness kept it down slightly
Mouthfeel is thick and viscous, how a 13% abv imperial porter should be.
Overall- this is one of my top 5 beers of all time.   Trade for this and don't be afraid to overpay.  Well worth it. 803 charactersjcflorian, Apr 02, 2017

The look is dark with faint light coming through the top, 1/2 inch of head that fades overtime and lacing that rings the glass after consumed. Smell is definitely rich in maple syrup and sweetness, faint but noticeable wood characters. The bourbon comes through the smell as it warms a couple degrees along with vanilla and subtle coconut. This beer tastes very good. Maple, char, vanilla, dark fruits, coffee, toffee. It feels thin for the abv, but it is a porter! Overall I wanted bacon as I was looking for it all the way through the glass! Glad I knocked it off the list, on to the next one. Cheers. 666 charactersBEER88, Mar 05, 2017

Flavor is all chocolate and bourbon, full of intense authentic bourbon flavor that fades into chocolate.  It's certainly retaining some of that classic 'MBCP' flavor, but it's taking a back seat to the bourbon.  Still, not harsh or too challenging to drink.

Black to clear deep brown on the edges.  About 1/2 inch of head that settles to about 1/8 inch.  Decent lacing on a sip.
Nose is strong maple, smoke, bacon, roasted malt, a bit of coffee.
Taste is similar to the nose with maple, bourbon, smoke/salt, malt, minor booze, and a coffee backbone.
Mouthful is medium and smooth.  Carbonation is average to low.  Finish is semi sweet.
Really really good Porter.  The balance here is excellent.  The drinkability is on a similar level.  Hard to find anything really wrong here.  Seek it out. 553 charactersSlack, Feb 12, 2017

A: Very, very dark brown, and completely opaque. A low amount of visible carbonation, and a half-finger of tan head fades fairly quickly to a ring of foam.
S: Amazing. Coffee, bourbon, chocolate. Maple syrup, vanilla, savory salinity. Light oak tannins, roasted malts. This absolutely deserved the rating I'm giving it.
T: Coffee and bourbon up front. Maple syrup, smoky bacon, and vanilla. Oaky tannins, and then a mild smokiness. Vanilla and chocolate in balance, and with some brown sugar and caramel. It finishes with maple-covered bacon savoriness.
M: A nice thick body, but nothing syrupy. It still does manage to stain the glass a bit. Restrained alcohol presence for style and for the listed ABV. Low carbonation sensation.
O: Really, really good. This hits all my buttons for sure. Really one of my favorite beers. 1,024 charactersmacrosmatic, Feb 10, 2017

When my friends tell me the only way  many of their best brews could only be purchased at the brewery and now they are releasing them state wide I didn't realize how lucky I am to get their top of the line beers.  Yay for FB and thank you.  This is one of the best beers I've ever had. 382 charactersNewbeergeek1, Feb 06, 2017

4.88/5  rDev +5.2%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5Served off tap from a snifter, too cold for a stout but allowed to warm.
L - Dark black, with a thin tan head. Head lasted until sipped, then dissipated completely. No lacing to speak of.
S - Probably the highlight of the whole experience. Like straight smoke and salt, with strong roasted background characters. One of the best smelling beers I've ever encountered. "Breakfast," is a pretty apt description, like the kind you'd wake up to on a family outing to a log cabin. The vanilla and alcohol notes of the bourbon are also there.
T - Unlike most BA stouts, the bourbon is just a supporting actor, instead of overwhelming. I've gotten pretty burned out on the style due to the feeling I'm drinking hard alcohol with a built-in chaser, but this doesn't do that at all. I was also very hesitant to believe bacon fits in beer, but everyone else was right, and I was wrong. The smokey and savory characteristics are great complements for the dark malts, with no feeling of fatty or oily flavors or textures. The coffee takes some work to find, which is about the only loss, but it's there.
F - High viscosity, in a good way.
O - The kind of beer that sticks with you and you start obsessing over. Just about as close to perfect as you'll find. I've never -- despite living in Florida -- had MBCP, so I'm not completely sure how it compares, but the barrel aging does not keep it from working like a beer should, and the bacon is a surprisingly perfect compliment. 1,469 charactersHiram_McDaniels, Jan 22, 2017

This looks like a word class imperial porter ought to very dark brown ( not quite black) and a mocha head that fades slowly sticking to the glass.
The aroma is incredible, wood, whiskey, vanilla ,and LOTS of it. The second pour and the third are almost as fragrant
slight quibble but this is about a notch too sweet, I'll get my sugar fix from Ben and Jerry still delightful, just saying
This coats the mouth/throat like cough syrup, wonderful.
Out of 700 plus ratings I may have given a dozen this high. Good stuff! 597 charactersThirstygoat, Jan 21, 2017

S- Great aroma. I could just sit here and smell it. I notice the coffee first, followed by the maple. Just a hint of smokiness. Sugary. 
T- Similar to the nose. Sweet base with a lot of coffee and maple. Slight smoke in the taste as well and a hint of barrel that isn't overpowering. 
F- Decent feel. Medium body, a little sticky. Smooth. 
O- Very tasty beer. Unique combination of flavors that I would love to have again. 505 charactersZoomslowik, Jan 19, 2017

A: This beer pours dark. Almost pitch black with a dark tan head than sticks around.
S: It smells like a sugary, maple extract, boozy mess. Don't pull the coffee or the smokiness of the bacon. The maple smell artificial.
T: Artificial maple flavor, the faintest coffee and bacon at the very end. It's just a sugary beer. Kind of boozy until it warms a little.
M: It's a good mouthfeel for a porter. A nice mouth coating, medium bodied beer.
O: I was disappointed here. A lot of hype around this beer and really don't get it. It pours great, looks great in the glass. It smells and tastes of maple extract and booze with very little of the other adjuncts. Not a lot here for me to get excited about. 702 charactersAMCimpi, Jan 02, 2017

Dark brown body with an oily, beige head. The aroma brings smoked meat, char, chocolate, bourbon. Brown sugar notes, vanilla, lightly burnt maple syrup. Sweet and rich with a mild alcohol burn in the finish. Quite tasty. 275 charactersHuhzubendah, Jan 01, 2017

4.74/5  rDev +2.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Look is solid, typical BBS but nothing too noteworthy.  The smell hits you as soon as you open the bottle, much less actually stick your nose in the glass.  Massive quantities of maple syrup and coffee on the nose, definitely one of the best smelling beers I've ever had.  Flavor brings out more of the same with the barrel presence being beautifully integrated and not overpowering the adjuncts.  An absolutely wonderful coffee flavor with awesome levels of sweetness balancing it all out.  I don't really get any bacon other than a tiny bit of smoke.  As it warms the flavor turns woodier and drier; reminds me a lot of CBS at that point.  Feel is nice and relatively thick.  Definitely one of my favorite beers of all time. 726 charactersDactrius, Dec 28, 2016

Overall it's a few steps forward from the base beer, really tasty with the ABV hidden really well. 370 charactersCiocanelu, Dec 26, 2016

I didn't find it enjoyable whatsoever. Due to the levels of the maple you can't discern any other flavors. I couldn't get much coffee, smoke, or Barrel. It's also light in body for the abv. This was an all around miss for me. I guess I am the -1%. 345 charactersaasher, Dec 15, 2016

4.6/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Bottle share (thanks Pat!), it pours pitch black color with a 1 finger creamy brown head that faded and left spotty lacing that clings to the sides.
Smells of maple syrup, molasses, fresh coffee grinds, brown sugar, bourbon and a ton of sugary sweetness. It's crazy how powerful the maple syrup comes off, but the complexities of this brew allow the syrup to tie into the overall nose and let the malt shine in conjunction with the bourbon barrel influence.
Tastes as good as it smells with the maple syrup, molasses, fresh coffee grinds, brown sugar, bourbon, dark fruit, candied sugar, dark chocolate and a sweetness that seems like bacon. A little too sweet, but so different and complex that I love the flavor overall. Smooth and easy to drink, it hides the ABV masterfully and was an excellent experience beer overall. 825 charactersCHickman, Dec 04, 2016

Pours opaque near black with a half-inch tan head that disappears completely and leaves faint spots of lace. The smell is of maple, chocolate and faint coffee. The taste follows with decadent dark chocolate, sweet maple syrup, dark roast coffee and subtle bourbon accents. Medium texture with medium carbonation. As advertised, a delicious sweet and decadent imperial porter. 391 charactersFurlinator, Nov 24, 2016

Both vintages were very light on the barrel.  Both are amazing but I prefer the over the top maple and lighter coffee of 2015, hopefully this new batch will develop similarly with some age. 481 charactersMshea805, Nov 13, 2016

Appearance is black with small espresso head that quickly recedes. 
Smell is maple bourbon upfront and intense.  Possibly some roasted mixed in. 
Taste is simply amazing.  Maple upfront with slight bourbon. The bourbon is nowhere near as strong as the nose leads it to believe.  That roasted flavor finishes it off nicely.  Excellent balance with sweet after taste.   Alcohol is well hidden.  
Feel is typical of a porter. 
Overall an excellent beer to sit and enjoy.  In my top 5 favorites.  Funky Buddha doing what they do best, making great beers. 584 characterssorthcj, Nov 13, 2016

S: wow, huge maple aroma, very sweet. I get nice coffee, and slight buurbon.
T: all the flavors are toned down a bit compared to the aroma. But the maple is the main player, the coffee is slightly hard to find and the bourbon is about the same. 
F: it's thin for a 13% abv ba beer. It's sticky and syrupy. Highly carbonated which I'm not a fan of either 447 charactersyesterdayfaraway, Nov 12, 2016

Bottled on 10/25/16   13%ABV
Favorite new beer I tried this year, and by far the best beer I've had in a LONG time!  Had to get that out of the way before I forgot to mention it. 
Pours out silky smooth(not chunky chugs at all) with a perfect espresso color that leaves a milk chocolate colored tuft of foam swirling in the glass. The nose is reminiscent of a Starbucks cafe mocha. Smooth coffee and sweet chocolate in front on the first sip. Finish is slightly smokey, vanilla from oak, maple lingers and is all I can taste until I take my next sip. Minimal bourbon, but it melds with everything perfectly.
-Refresh/Repeat-
Every bit warmer this gets, the more the maple makes its way to the front of the pack. Creamy and smooth was this Porter. Delicate but powerful. This never let on that it was 13%. Drinks  like it is more like its in the 9-10 range. This bully just beat up CBS and took its lunch money! I guess that's what you get when you mess with somebody that is bigger, but in the same class. 1,050 charactersLloydDobler, Nov 10, 2016

Smell - Lots of maple, slight roast, no barrel.
Taste - The barrel came through compared to the first bottle consumed in May but it was subtle. There is less maple now but its an amazing blend of maple throughout, I could use more coffee personally.
Feel - great, marshmellow and thick creamy finish.
Loved this beer, it was very smooth, it's unbelievable how much maple is present. I could use more barrel overall but its among the best stouts I've had. 493 charactersJoeyStats707, Oct 06, 2016

Smell - almost identical to MBCP - not getting any bourbon. Maple syrup and pancakes. A bit of bacon.
Taste - I don't get any bourbon, which is unfortunate. I really get the same flavors as MBCP. I wasn't a huge fan, but this is pretty good. 
Mouth feel - pretty light. It doesn't come across as a nice thick porter. 
Overall - I was a bit disappointed.  I think this is WAY over hyped. It's good, but not even remotely close to some of the other bourbon barrel-aged beers. This is average all the way. I would NOT seek it as anything special. 574 charactersBeersnake1, Oct 01, 2016

A- pours nearly opaque black color with a foamy off-white head that leaves great lacing behind 
S- aroma explodes with a mixture of fresh coffee and spicy bourbon, followed by sweet maple syrup. The barrel also gives of aromas of caramel, toasted coconut, toffee & spicy wood. Smells like breakfast in a glass with a side of whisky 
T- opens with a mixture of spicy bourbon & oak, along with dark chocolate and a big hit of maple syrup sweetness. Mid-palate gives smoky malt that resembles flavors of smoked pork (bacon). The finish gives more maple sweetness with the bourbon barrel imparting more spicy oak and barrel juice. The linger gives more fresh coffee and maple sweetness 
M- medium body with low carbonation leads to a slightly foamy mouthfeel that turns creamy into the finish, with a hint of abv burn on the linger 
O- the bourbon barrel is a perfect compliment to the base beer. It further enhances the maple sweetness and the smokiness of the beer. Another masterpiece from FB 1,030 charactersTreyliff, Jun 04, 2016

Its very boldly flavored, eye-opening, and over the top. I cant really knock it too much for being as advertised but it gets a bit too close to being beer candy and while none of the flavors is artificial each presents itself very assertively. 
FB represents a very interesting niche in the industry with many assertive fruit/veggie/adjunct beers that seem to feature the adjuncts more than the base beer. 493 charactersrobear, May 29, 2016

This pours a ridiculously thick and syrupy looking black, with a small head, and no lacing. This absolutely stains the glass, which is crazy.
Smells like a ridiculous amount of maple, a little bit of bourbon, and tons of chocolate.
The barreling of this one kind of drowns out the smoke and coffee, though they still are there. It somehow seems to amplify the maple, which is sweeter here than the base. There's just enough barrel- not a ton of it, but enough to help everything else out. It's super creamy and utterly decadent. This is one of the best BA stouts I've ever had. 
This is so sticky and thick bodied, with a lower level of carbonation.
One of the most ridiculous beers I've ever had. So rich, so decadent, and just so over the top. Absolutely delicious and an achievement in flavored stouts. 857 charactersGreesyFizeek, May 29, 2016

It was well represented on the nose though. Regardless these are minor critisms of an amazing beer. 371 characterskylehay2004, May 14, 2016

Poured fromm a 22oz bomber into a Funky Buddha snfiter. Acquired in a trade.
Pours an inky, pitch black body with a coffee brown head that reduces pretty quickly to leave a small ring of retention and a little bit of lacing. 
Aromas are heavenly.. potent and rich, a wonderful combination of sweet maple, vanilla-bourbon, roasty coffee, chocolate, toffee, butterscotch. Extremely inviting. Closer to a 5 than a 4.75 in this category. Nearly perfect. 
Taste is exactly what you would predict from the aromas, light-to-moderate sweetness with lots of maple syrup, vanilla, and bourbon upfront, follows through with caramel and coffee, finishes lightly roasty with coffee on the finish. Aftertaste is smokey.
All the flavors are amazing and this beer is world class, but little more body would have gone a long way. Not watery but a little less potent flavors/body than the nose would suggest. Medium carbonation. 
Overall this is crazy good.. an EXCELLENT breakfast stout, a hair below good morning and mornin' delight, but miles above the rest. 1,062 charactersgcamparone, May 08, 2016

Pours a dark chocolate black body, one finger brown head with long retention, medium collar, a bit of lacing here and there. Smells of maple syrup, pancakes, chocolate, coffee, mild bourbon presence. The bourbon adds actual smokiness, which is great and makes this really work quite well. Amazing. Flavour is equally excellent, with a load of maple syrup, coffee and bourbon. The milk chocolate stays steady throughout, while the maple syrup peaks early and is overtaken by the coffee and bourbon. Drinking this beer is quite the ride. Mouthfeel is full bodied, even a little sticky, good carbonation, and would be an awesome breakfast beer. All of the diner breakfast flavours, none of the cheap aspects of it- this is top shelf stuff. 778 charactersStevedore, May 01, 2016

L - thick, oily, nice lacing, minimal head
S - huge burst of maple syrup, coffee, and a little burnt toast.  Maybe a hint of bourbon and oak as well but not much
T - doesn't change much as it warms but nice balance of maple, dark roast coffee, and milk chocolate.  A little oak as well
F - not as heavy as it looks.  creamy but a little thinner than expected
O - really enjoyable beer.  I seem to rate it a little lower than most mainly because I didn't get as much barrel and complexity as expected, so maybe I set the bar too high!  Great beer and would love to have this again. 633 charactersrabbott2, Mar 30, 2016

Everything is there as advertised - bourbon, maple, smoke, chocolate, coffee; but none of it really pops or stands out to me. It has more cola than I care for in the flavor and may be a bit over carbonated. Its possible that I'm not appreciating a really well made, balanced beer but this did stand out for me. 397 charactersdanh53, Mar 14, 2016

Taste follows with smokey bacon like flavor.  Maple is there but just adds a nice sweetness.  Toasty, roasty and maybe a bit too heavy handed with the smoke.  Finish leaves a long lingering smoky sweetness.  This beer is an assault on the senses in a good way.  Overall this beer is fantastic but is a little too heavy on the salty/smokey aspect.

From a bomber into a snifter
Imperial porter aged in bourbon barrels with coffee, maple syrup and natural flavors added
Imperial version of Maple Bacon Coffee Porter
APPEARANCE: A clear black pour yields a 3 finger, medium looking, creamy tan head with great retention. Black body and no real carbonation evident. Head slowly fades to a full cap and coats the sides of the glass. A splotchy wisp remains until the end and leaves lots of nice lacing down the glass. 
SMELL: Lots of maple syrup. Piles of it. Some light coffee aroma with vanilla cream, milk chocolate and hints of the bourbon barrel as well, but this is mostly maple syrup. Decadent maple syrup for sure. 
TASTE: Maple all over the place, with some oak, vanilla and cream up front. Very flavorful start. More maple at the swallow with a big and lingering finish of syrup, sweet vanilla cream, butterscotch, some hints of oak and bourbon and enough bitter coffee to round it out. Really wonderful. 
PALATE: Medium-full body with medium carbonation. Creamy smooth on the palate, goes down fine with a bit of a scratch at the swallow and finishes sticky. A bit of heat lingers. 
OVERALL: This imperial version of MBCP is way, way more enjoyable and interesting than the original. Obviously it’s brewed bigger, but the result is exponentially better. It’s definitely heavy on the maple syrup and lighter on the barrel component, but it’s decadent and satisfying in its own way.  After having Snowed In very recently, it wouldn’t surprise me if these two used the same base imperial porter as a starting point, as both were very similar in quality. Two excellent adjunct imperial porters for sure. Lovely. Thanks again dboon! 1,754 charactersJeffo, Jan 27, 2016

Pours black as night and is super thick. 
I nearly feel out of my chair when iI smelled this thing! Maple Syrup explodes out of the glass and  is held in check just enough by the oak and bourbon characteristics. Only other stout i'ce ever had that smelled this good was Morning Delight on tap. 
Flavor is out of control. A touch more bourbon / body would have made this a perfect beer, but it's still one of the best beers I've ever had!

Not a great looking beer as its a medium see through brown, not much head or card.  The aroma comes off a touch too sweet as the maple syrup dominates.  After the first sip its instantly apparent this beer is to thin to hold up completely well.  Its also almost too roasty. Its a beer of extremes, too sweet, yet too roasty, and too thin. The finish provides a very nice touch of vanilla that saves it.  I warm up to this as I go, and its very drinkable. However, its lacking and not deserved of the over hype. 546 charactersjrallen34, Jan 10, 2016

Right up there with Mornin Delight for me. 322 charactersfondyball20, Jan 10, 2016

Thanks to wickedwort for sending this one over in a trade!
A: Opaque black, 1.5 fingers width of dense mocha colored head which dissipates slowly and leaves a fair amount of lacing.  4.5
S: Tons of maple and a big coffee presence, subtle saltiness, chocolate, lactose like cream, cinnamon.  Tons going on.  Barrel notes are present with oaky vanilla.  Fantastic. 4.75
T: Lots of coffee bitterness, and a nice charred oakiness from the barrel.  Sweet maple syrup on the finish.  Bourbony booze.  I don’t get much of the bacon characters which are quite prevalent in the normal MBCP, just a bit of saltiness, but IMO those characters are a bit overwhelming in MBCP anyways.  Lots of roastiness.  Excellent.  4.5
M/D: Incredibly creaminess, silky smooth.  Fully bodied, ABV exceptionally well masked and drinkability is very good.  4.75
O: Exceptional beer.  I like it way more than MBCP.  Not quite the level of BA Snowed In, but wonderful nonetheless.  4.75 1,010 characterszac16125, Jan 01, 2016

Has fantastic aromas to it, offering lots of slightly smoked, chocolate infused malts, among caramel and melting toffee. Atop of this foundation settle fresh, cold pressed coffee beans, blending perfectly into the already established sweetness. Maple syrup provides a soothing quality, tying the flavors outstandingly well together, balanced by a wooden vanilla oakiness. 
Drinks very smooth throughout, while featuring a spicy warmth during its finish, exhibiting the beers huge body in a perfect fashion. The tongue gets coated by mocha and bakers chocolate for minutes, showcasing a thick, rich softness on the tongue.
Creates its taste foundation by bringing maple syrup coated, fresh crushed coffee beans, toffee and roasty malts to the palate. This creates a great interplay between uprising milk chocolate, whipped cream, espresso and cinnamon coated wood bark. Once established, the flavors mainly evolve due to the genuine integrated Bourbon barrel, adding vanilla, coconut bark, mellowed by the syrup. Coffee bitterness maintains enough character to cut through, soothed by whipped cream, becoming even richer, when a subtle smokiness arises from the malts, effectivly blending into the barrel's spiciness. Finishes with milk chocolate, softening the beers warmer Bourbon bite, featuring an enjoyable espresso bean bitterness during the aftertaste, remaining on the palate for a while.
Fantastic beer, with an intense, far reaching flavor profile, slowly adding complexity till the very end, resulting in a complex, very smooth stout. All the different adjuncts get integrated outstandingly great, entangled into the beers luscious milk chocolate, whipped cream foundation. 1,886 charactersaleigator, Dec 30, 2015

5/5  rDev +7.8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A- This thick and black liquid hits the glass as dark as midnight on Christmas. A small and very dark colored head forms and is gone fairly quickly, turning into just a ring of foam around the top of the glass. There is just a bit of lacing despite the lack of much of a head and there are just a few alcohol legs presents.
S- Holy breakfast in a glass! Where do I begin in describing the scent wafting from my snifter? Strong maple syrup scents hit first and give the beer a sweet first impression before the coffee moves in. The coffee is largely overpowered by the maple, but there is some dark roast present and detectable. At this point, this beer literally smells like a Starbucks concoction. On the back half of the smell a bit of salty bacon scent comes in before the slightest touch of whiskey barrel kicks in. Then the scent is gone from the nose. The lingering flavor in the nostrils is mostly maple and coffee, with just a hint of bacon and whiskey.
T- Hello to the maple gods who blessed this beer! The maple syrup sweetness kicks the drink off just like it did the scent before the coffee ramps up. Again, just like in the smell, this tastes like a maple syrup-sweetened coffee on the front half of the drink. The middle of the drink sees a bit of the salty bacon flavor kick in before just a subtle bit of barrel introduces itself on the back half of the drink. The whiskey barrel is mostly light char that serves to bring a balance to the mostly sweet, maple syrup flavor. The lingering flavor on the tongue is predominantly maple and bourbon barrel, with the coffee roast and bacon salt contributing in minor roles.
M- For the style, this beer is fairly highly carbonated and a little on the thin side. Despite these facts, it still drinks incredibly smooth and hides the alcohol level almost completely. Only a slight warming sensation can be felt for a second after the drink is over. I wish this beer was a little thicker and less carbonated, but those are both minor complaints given the supreme scent and taste of the beer.
Overall, this beer is simply amazing. The scent alone is one of the most delicious things I have ever smelled, beer or anything else.And then the maple.....the maple makes this beer! It sweetens up both the scent and flavor of the beer and truly makes this feel and taste like breakfast in a glass. No offense to Founders CBS, but this beer is the ultimate experience of maple in a beer. Despite minor objections to the feel and appearance of the beer, the scent and the flavor are more than enough to justify a perfect score. 2,576 charactersboilermakerbrew, Dec 23, 2015

Taste follows the nose, sweet maple syrup, nice roasted coffee, and just a slight hint of the whiskey barrel.   This beer has a very creamy taste, leaves a solid coating in your mouth.

Some maple and milk chocolate. Coffee is the perfect flavor for me. Bold, dark and roast. Taste is strong coffee and maple sweetness. Very little bourbon or barrel in there. I would not say that’s a complaint because the beer is so damn amazing for what it is. More bourbon barrel would take away from the amazing coffee and maple. So if you are looking for a great ba stout, this might be the wrong one to try, but if you want possibly the worlds best coffee stout this would be hard to beat. 595 charactersDrunkAl, Nov 17, 2015

4.88/5  rDev +5.2%look: 4.25 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75This beer is incredible - like nothing I've ever tried before. As soon as you pop the cap, maple syrup aroma explodes from the bottle with so much force its almost overwhelming (in the best way possible). Anybody who entered the room after it's  opening immediately asked what the wonderful maple aroma was coming from. I noticed a subtle coffee aroma mingling with some smoke, vanilla, and oak bourbon notes as well. Pour is very very dark brown with a light brown head fading quickly. The taste is exactly like the smell, just downright decadent. Huge sweet maple and vanilla bourbon flavors pair extremely well with the subtle coffee and smokey flavors. Coffee is just the right amount - perfect for cutting the sweetness of the maple and the barrel. Mouthfeel is velvety and slick. Full bodied and rich without being too heavy or too thin - just right. Easily drank the whole bomber by myself with the exception of a few friends having some samples. As soon as I drank this, I was on the forums looking to trade for another. This is a must try beer. Seek it out! 1,066 charactersalerxovawo, Nov 16, 2015

Smell is rich with coffee, chocolate, maple, bourbon and salty pork. Taste reflects the same with strong coffee and chocolate overtones. Slight salty taste at the finish with the bourbon coming through nicely. Feel is sticky and smooth. Magnificent beer from FB, they are hitting on all cylinders on this one 410 characterscostanzo_mike, Nov 15, 2015
4.84/5  rDev +4.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Pours a deep dark brown. One finger head that's a bit lighter. Medium dissipation rate. Nice layer of film and edge ringing stays behind. Maple, bacon, chocolate, coffee. Wow. No booziness to be found on nose though still warming. After my first sip I'm now picking up the barrel and booze smell. I'll put the taste right there with Good Morning. A little more chocolate and a little less coffee. Amazing. It's breakfast less the eggs with chocolate milk. The slight bacon salt and sweet barrel take it up a notch. Super smooth and rich. A light carbonation. Fantastic beer. 574 charactersHootie159, Nov 15, 2015

It does drink like an imperial porter over stout, it is not that heavy and the flavors are all the sharper because of it.  Very impressive beer. 395 characterstimc100, Nov 04, 2015

Friday afternoon I pulled the bottle from the fridge in my office, hopped on my bike, and began biking to my buddy's place. With beer in hand I was coming into a turn too fast, hit a patch of leaves, and my tires slid out. Beer tumbles across the street, cap pops off but bottle stays intact. I rushed to save this precious liquid and was left with half the bomber and a lot of foam. Drank the bottle as I walked to my buddy's place coated in a layer of drirt, scrapes, and delicious beer. Really creamy mouth feel, coffee, subtle bourbon and maple, some smoke but not sure I'd claim Bacon if I didn't know the beer prior to drinking, 680 charactersmctizzz, Oct 24, 2015

Smells of sweet coffee with a hint of maple.
Sweet flavor is balanced well by toasty malts. The sweetness lingers with some coffee bitterness. Has medium viscousity and light carbonation. Hard to pick out the maple syrup but he sweetness is there. No heat from the bourbon but some caramel flavor.
Overall, a pleasant maple bourbon porter. 414 charactersGetalegup, Sep 22, 2015
3.8/5  rDev -18.1%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5Look - small head, not much legs
Smell - Tons of maple syrup. Slight oak and sweet bourbon. Smells amazing, like you could pour this over pancakes.
Taste - Bourbon comes though nicely along with most of the flavors from mbcp. Maple is just a tad sweeter than I'd like. Heat is minimal. Bitter dark chocolate at the back of your palate. Just a little too fumbled on the flavors they just don't compliment each other at all. 
Feel - medium. Very Porterish
Overall - let me start off by saying this beer is good. This is just a fumbled mess of flavors. They don't go well together. The flavors are really nice individually but they don't come together well. I expected the taste to be better with such an intoxicating smell. I'll get off the hype train here on this one, don't give up the farm in a trade. I prefer regular MBCP over this one 838 charactersRaziel313, Sep 22, 2015

S - Massive maple syrup and coffee. Some oak and vanilla, but bourbon is absent.
T - Bourbon is big on the taste (thank God). Maple for days, roasted coffee. A small alcohol taste, but the sweetness is helping to cancel that out. No more salt and smoke from standard MBCP.
F - Thick and viscous. Maple and bourbon linger. Small alcohol sting, but I'll live.
O - While all individual flavors are superb, I can't help but feel that they don't all compliment each other and instead are fighting their own fight. I want to emphasize that I don't think the beer is a letdown for that reason (FAR from it), but it had to be said. 712 charactersThrewRedButter, Sep 20, 2015

S- Maple syrup, coffee, dark chocolate, oak
T- This is where it really excels, perfectly balanced between the maple, coffee, lightly charred oak and bourbon, one never becoming overbearing or outshining any other aspect of the beer.
F- Has heft but doesn't feel like drinking a meal the way a zhukov does, again, perfect balance.
O- The best beer that has come out of Funky Buddha for me, no question. One of my favorite beers of all time. 489 characterstravisdiener32, Sep 10, 2015

Huge smells of maple, humongous smells of maple.
Taste was all sweet maple syrup but extremely drinkable, unlike MBCP, which was just overly sweet. This beer had a nice balance of char and roast, possibly from the barrel or from the residual coffee affects. Unfortunately, no bourbon came through but this beer was quite enjoyable, despite its faults. I couldn't believe it was %12, very well hidden.
Overall, I'm glad I went, the release was super smooth. 534 charactersfloridadrift, Sep 09, 2015
5/5  rDev +7.8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 59/8/2015 on-tap at the Funky Buddha's Morning Wood release. Served in a Funky Buddha snifter. Aged in Heaven Hill Barrels. 12% ABV.
Appearance – Jet black, with a slight tan head. An amazing looking beer.
Smell – Smells like maple, bacon, coffee and slight bourbon.
Taste – Unbelievable complextity. You can taste maple and bacon right off the bat, with a coffee finish. The barrel come through slightly and perfectly. 
Mouthfeel – I cannot believe this is 12%. Dangerous. That’s about all that needs to be said.
Overall – Bottom line, this is the best beer I have ever had. I never give perfect scores, but this is as close as I have ever come. Could easily drink 6 of these and enjoy them all equally. But would be very wasted if I actually did that. Cannot wait for Snowed In! 796 charactersjws6w7, Sep 09, 2015

Dark as night pour, very little head retention, but who cares about all of that. U want to know about the tastes. As amazing as it's ever been. Tons of bacon goodness on the nose, hints of coffee and the barrel on the front end, a touch of sweetness on the back end, basically all the flavors u want in a beer.
PERFECT. 443 charactersmanutdfan, Sep 29, 2013

4.9/5  rDev +5.6%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5On tap at FBL's second anniversary party.
A - Dark brown with a thin layer of foam. Fairly opaque with the color somewhat murky.
S - Coffee (but not overpowering), definitely some bourbon, sweet maple. Smells enticing but not quite as great as some other FBL porters and stouts.
T - Hands down one of the best tasting beers I've ever had. The bourbon blends so well with the other flavors that you feel like you are sipping an excellent, smooth cordial not a beer. The 11.2 % abv is well hidden and makes it easy to drink fast but who would want to do that?
M - This beer feels very smooth/velvety and almost as enjoyable before its swallowed. I don't recall any stickyness like other FBL offerings.
O - Definitely my favorite beer from Funky Buddha. I feel very lucky to have tried it since it is rarely brewed. I've never had Dark lord, KBS or even BCBS but I would have to believe Morning Wood is at least in the same league.
Revised review 9/20/14 - On tap at Funky Buddha Lounge 4th Anniversary Party.  I don't know exactly why this beer failed to deliver at the latest release but it was not the stellar barrel aged stout I remember.  The smell was very good as usual and the look was fine but the taste was not well integrated between the bourbon and the maple and coffee flavors.  Maybe it wasn't aged long enough?  Not enjoyable to drink and I wonder how I could have rated it so high two years ago.  I now have had some of the highest rated barrel aged beers and it presently doesn't measure up. Maybe future releases will prove me wrong.
10/29/16 - At the brewery drinking Morning Wood on tap (bottle release day). Fantastic batch. This beer is my favorite barrel aged bourbon beer when it's on. This day, it is perfectly balanced. The bourbon doesn't overpower the other flavors but lingers to add the perfect end to each sip. Ratings are going way up! 1,871 charactersELS, Oct 03, 2012
4.62/5  rDev -0.4%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5On-tap at the Funky Buddha's 2nd Anniversary Party. Served in a Funky Buddha snifter. This version is apparently genuinely bourbon barreled in Palm Ridge barrels.
Appearance - Like Wide Awake, it's black without being inky. Some wisps of khaki bubbles. Slightly sticky.
Smell - So it smells nice than Wide Awake, but not enough to mark it up. It's got the same brilliant coffee aroma blended with the smoked malts, but the barrel mellows both. Bourbon with just the slightest hint of earthiness and oak. Subtle barrel character.
Taste - And that subtle barrel character is what really separates this from Wide Awake. It's definitely not overpowering with the bourbon. It's there, but it blends with the coffee and mutes the acidity. It amplifies the earthy character of the coffee and amplifies the maple. The smoke acts as a counterpart to the sweetness and reminds me just a little bit of CBS. It's phenomenal.
Mouthfeel - Nothing near 11.5%. I nearly gulped it down in hopes of ordering a second, but it was long gone. None of the astringent characteristics of Wide Awake come through.
Overall - One of the best tasting stouts I've ever had. I don't know who called this an RIS, but it definitely isn't. It's all about the blending of smoke, maple, bourbon, and coffee to create a near perfect balance, a la CBS. I can't wait for Funky Buddha to open their new brewery and make this a year-round 12 ounce for $9.99 a sixer. Ok, so I'm dreaming. 1,452 charactersAlieniloquium, Sep 30, 2012

4.77/5  rDev +2.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Keg at EBF.
Creamy darker head, super dark brown beer with a hint of rosy light.
Nose fresh espresso roasted coffee, chocolate, dark and bakers, pure cocoa, hint of bourbon and oak, with touch vanilla as well.
Taste is pure heaven, lots of dark chocolate and cocoa, fresh espresso, coffee, touch maple and some vanilla, bit more whisky but not sure if bourbon, and hints of smoke that remind me of bacon somewhat. Some bitterness, no burnt flavors, earthy hops on finish. Smooth and just delicious.
Mouth is full bodied, luscious and a bit creamy, barely any booze.
Overall just amazing. Awesome flavors, blended well and smooth, very little booze, so delicious, I wish I could get more. No bad off flavors either. This was literally THE talk of the entire fest. 767 charactersjlindros, Feb 13, 2012

4.63/5  rDev -0.2%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5From 02/03/12 notes. On tap at NOTB up in Boston, MA.
a - Pours a pitch black color with an inch or two of dark tan head and moderate carbonation evident. Looks like a pretty great RIS.
s - Smells of coffee grinds, whiskey, vanilla, oak, roasted malts, espresso, and dark chocolate. Pure coffee smell to it, and the whiskey and vanilla comes through nicely. No real maple in the nose but still really nice.
t - Tastes of coffee grinds, roasted malts, dark chocolate, whiskey, vanilla, sweet dark fruits, maple/sugar, and oak. A little bit sweeter than the nose and less whiskey then the nose, but I still really like it.
m - Medium to full body and moderate carbonation. Thick like motor oil, but not hot at all. Very nice body.
o - Overall a really great RIS, and one of the best beers of the weekend. Pure coffee in the nsoe and taste, but the whiskey comes through nicely. Great body, would love to have this one again. 927 charactersmdfb79, Feb 10, 2012

4.45/5  rDev -4.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5I was able to grab 3 pours (2 of my own and one from my wife) at Night of the Barrels.
Appearance: Pours a very dark brown to black color with a layer of smooth tan head that fades to a ring around the pour and leaves some decent lacing on the plastic cup.
Smell: Sweet malt up front with nutty coffee, maple, and some roast. I'm getting some mild alcohol, but not very much.
Taste: This is a very sweet beer, but it works quite well. The barrel seems to enhance the maple flavor, but the coffee stands out as well. I'm not getting a whole lot from the bacon here, but everything I'm picking up I'm loving.
Mouthfeel: The body is thick with smooth carbonation and a dry finish.
Overall: I love me some maple stouts, so this is right up my alley. I was going to give it a 5 here, but then I tried the regular version the next day and enjoyed that even more. Fantastic and I feel very fortunate to have tried it. 915 charactersoline73, Feb 08, 2012
5/5  rDev +7.8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Reviewed from notes at NotB this past weekend. Was fortunate enough to enjoy 2.5 pours of this gem before it kicked.
Extremely viscous and pitch-black body. Mounds of dark brown head stew on the surface, clutching the sides of my tasting cup for dear life. Hard to believe this isn't nitro.
Freshly roasted coffee erupts from the foam, turning heads across the room. Roasty malts and caramel sugar join the fray. Reminds me of a fresh mocha espresso drink from my favorite coffee shop. Easily one of the best aromas I've ever smelled from *any* beverage, let alone a beer.
Taste is nothing short of revolutionary. Everything from the nose is here in full force with unbelievable depth of flavor and complexity at every corner. Whiskey barrels impart just the right amount of flavor; many brewers these days go nuts and over-emphasize the barrel character, but this was just right.
Huge, creamy body carries the torrent of flavors home flawlessly. Morning Wood is on the sweeter side of the spectrum, but still balances exceptionally well. The litmus test for this is my brother (who despises sweetness in beer, stouts in particular), and his illuminated face confirmed my suspicion that this was his new favorite beer.
It's easy to get caught up in the fury of this magical nectar while you're drinking it and make superlative claims left and right, which is why I decided to wait until after the weekend to collect my thoughts. That said, I can confidently say this is the best beer I've ever had. Morning Wood is simply on another level from every other stout.
How Funky Buddha managed to outclass every single other brewer at NotB & EBF is a mystery, but that isn't important; I just need more of this beer! 1,716 charactersbrystmar, Feb 07, 2012

5/5  rDev +7.8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5On tap poured into a sampling glass at Night of the Barrels 2012, easily the best non-sour beer of the fest.
Pours a super dark black with a creamy dark brown head that is a bit nitro-esque. Nose is just phenomenal, coffee, coffee, coffee - like a fresh cup of espresso with some chocolate and maple notes.
If the aroma wasn't enough to get your juices flowin, one sip and you'll say "Why the fuck haven't I been drinking this my whole life?" so well balanced, it is a coffee bomb but the light maple and oaky vanilla notes give it just the right sweetness. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy and the fresh coffee both demolishes your palate and lingers beautifully for a long time.
My first funky Buddha beer and I'm beyond sold. 728 characterskingcrowing, Feb 05, 2012
