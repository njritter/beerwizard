Smell:  Funky yeast, white pepper, rustic grass, lemon rind, pear and a hint of peach
Taste:  Funk forward and then the tart tones build, with grass, lemon rind, white wine grape and pear underneath; slightly bready, through the middle, with citrus pith and rind flavors exploding; very dry finish
Moutheel  Medium body, slightly creamy, with buoyant carbonation
Overall:  I was worried I might have cellared this too long as I think it might be three of four years old, but I am just wowed by the power and complexity of the flavors

4.84/5  rDev +7.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75The palatal sensation is quite remarkable. White peppers, thyme, jasmine, himalayan rock salt, cloves, oak, and lots and lots of bretty funky goodness. Some tart peach pith notes surface toward the back as the brew warms up as well, which is quite baffling as no fruit was purportedly harme... I mean used, in brewing this beer. Whatever it is, I could smell this over and over again.
This is an adjective I hesitate to use in describing beer, but the white pepper from the nose expresses itself in quite a pungent manner on the tongue. It's not at all unpleasant -- it hits the tongue with a brief but vigorous impression and slowly fades away toward the back of the throat. It's almost as if a pair of hands with very long nails leaped out of the glass and pinched your tongue for not wearing green on St. Paddy's Day and now you're just kind of flabbergasted wondering what happened.
Labored imagery aside, the pungent pepper is accompanied by some acetic citrus, a mild tart and yeasty body typical of a well-brewed saison, with a pleasant oak backdrop. There's a sharp acidic pinch from time to time that seems to pair off with the aforementioned pungency, but the astringency is nowhere close to being unpleasant, and mellows out pretty quickly.
The medium-light body with the creamy initial mouthfeel, together with the vibrant carbonation and the dry finish makes this an absolutely refreshing beer for all seasons. If I had to choose a beer to serve at a summer wedding, this would probably make it to the top of the list. 1,534 charactersamano_h, Oct 17, 2016

This one pours a very hazy golden yellow orange/yellow, with a small creamy head, and lots of lacing.
Smells like super tart citrus, sharp hay funk, peach, and a hint of grassiness.
This is the prototypical awesome new-American saison- there's a wonderful sour citrus character, a hint of oak, some hay and a barnyard type funk, and a hint of bitterness. This tastes so good.
This has a nicely creamy mouthfeel, bright and airy, with a good level of carbonation.
I'm finally having this one- and it doesn't disappoint at all. 589 charactersGreesyFizeek, Sep 19, 2016

Smell is funky, cheesey, lemony hay. Tastes match the smell and are very gueuze like. Resembles a gueuze to me, more so than any other American beer I have had. The beer has a medium body and is a touch under carbed for my preference, that finishes slightly dry. Overall, a delicious saison. 375 charactersOleDixie, Sep 05, 2016

A: Light golden sunshine, a good bit brighter than the base saison Anais, frothy cloud white billowy head, everything the base beer was missing appearance wise. This saison isn't messing around. 
S: Clove/Flowers, pepper, aged cheese rind funk, fresh tilled earth, sweaty fruit assortment, Capitola Ocean Breeze, lactic yogurt
T: A light tartness, flowers,hay, pineapple/Tangelo, salty cave aged cheese, 
M: A good bit more body than it's base beer somehow, Creamy, perfectly carbed
O: The best non barrel aged mixed fermentation Saison in existence. I will fight to the death over that statement. This isn't an American Wild ale labeled a saison. This has all the components of a clean saison with a light tartness and a funk that lets you know it's at the party but isn't breaking stuff or trying to bang on your parents bed. This beer should be served in 6 packs of 750ml bottles. 921 charactersEvahflow, Aug 24, 2016

This is really an incredibly well done beer.  The smell and taste were pretty consistent with each other.  A nice smoothness with a balance of both light tart and funkiness.  Grassy, but really citrusy too.  Super smooth and drinkable.  I'm certain I won't get a chance to drink this again, but I am very thankful I was lucky enough to try it. 384 charactersrabbott2, Aug 22, 2016

Lightly lactic on the nose with hints of funk character in the form of earthiness.  Slight spice and tropical fruit on the nose as well.
In the flavor there is a great grass quality, more lactic tartness and wonderful spice and earthiness.  Overall it's a bit cleaner than I expected but in a good way.
The mouthfeel is extraordinary.  Silky smooth and sharp on the finish.

A: Medium gold with some deep gold at the core and honey around the edges - lightly hazy - pours with a a dense, foamy, white head - slowly, slowly fades to a small cap, medium collar, leaves some streaks of lacing
S: Funk - very yeasty, with some pepper, some farmhouse - lightly grassy, some hay, some earth - some citrus, with touches of citrus zest and oil - some light fruits, mostly light apple with a touch of grapes - white wine some woody aroma - lots of funk, with some tartness, although it mellows a lot after it gets some air
T: Nicely funky - loads of yeasty flavors, with some pepper and spice - very funky, with some tart, yet also very dry - some farmhouse and hay - some acidity - earth and a touch of grass - some light fruits, touches of citrus, lemon, green apple, white grapes - white wine - minimal sweetness, really nice amount of dryness
M: Medium body, medium carbonation, some smoothness, crisp, finishes nicely dry and clean
O: Feel the Bernice 2016
I have been looking forward to a SARA beer for quite some time. And Saison Bernice mostly lives up to the hype. The funk and tart are very nice. This saison is clean overall, and I suppose it would work well as a base for a more intense saison. Lovely, yes, but I have been a bit spoiled by some others (thanks a lot, Hill Farmstead). 1,335 charactersangrybabboon, Jun 25, 2016

Beer slightly hazy. Almost glows yellow-orange. Fine carb fades to just a ring.
Aroma is slightly spicy. Taste brings a perfect balance of citrus, zesty yeast, citrus base, malt doesn't come through too much. Of course finishes very dry. Feels more carbonated than it looks. Very lively! 
Not sure I could tell the diff between this and saison du ble in a blind taste. 
Life is good, beer advocates, and so is this beer. 637 charactersbennyman12, Jun 19, 2016

4.42/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 750mL bottle into a Sante Adairius tulip glass. 
Pours a hazy bright yellow body with a big frothy 2 finger white head that sticks around for a while, eventually reducing to some chunky foam and leaving spotty lacing. 
Aromas are pronounced and inviting - a very clean saison character full of tartness, green apple, light banana, saison yeast, hay, and wheat. 
On the tongue is a gentle tartness, light citrus, saison yeastyness, subtle esters, tart apple, wheat, finishes lightly fruity and maybe even a tad sweet. Not as crisp and dry as some other Saisons I've had, but very drinkable and refreshing, medium carbonation. 
Saison Bernice is a solid saison - it hits all the high points of the style while being super complex and balanced. A really "chill" beer. 782 charactersgcamparone, Mar 16, 2016

Batch 4
Bottled 7/14, enjoyed 11/15
This pours a straw golden in the glass with a wonderful cap of clouds. Big brassy aroma announces its presence. I get strawberry and hay and a hint of lemon pith in the aroma. Tastes incredible too, with hints of grape and jasmine, strawberry flowers and the oil from a lemon peel. Wonderful carbonation. Brett is present without dominating. Each sip is followed by a bone dry finish. Sublime and superb. This was incredible. 480 characterselNopalero, Mar 07, 2016

4.62/5  rDev +2.7%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Light yellow and almost peachy in color, this beer hits the glass in a hazy pour. A medium to larger head forms and retains very well, leaving a good amount of lacing. Mild tartness and light acidity greets the nose up front with a touch of light fruitiness mixed in as well. There is no fruit, but I could swear that there is some peach or apricot in there somewhere. The back end of the scent is lightly funky and a little spicy, with an almost peppery quality.
This beer hits the tongue in a light burst of mild tartness, very similar to the scent. The flavor dries out a bit and the stone fruit from the scent also meets the taste buds. The back end of the drink dries out a little more and sees the introduction of light hay flavors and just a touch of peppery spice. On the palate, this one is very highly carbonated and almost drinks like a champagne. The drink is very thirst quenching and easy to drink. It is really light and almost fluffy feeling.
Overall, this is another very solid beer from SARA that doesn't disappoint. It is light and easy drinking while being delicately tart and quenching. A beautiful pour in the glass and a great scent makes this a pretty great all around beer. 1,200 charactersboilermakerbrew, Feb 14, 2016

-Light golden color with lots of lacing.
-Barnyard hay, oak, citrus.
-Lemon, apples, definitely oak. Pleasant tartness with underlying sweetness.
-Medium mouthfeel. Crisp and refreshing!
This Saison is my favorite so far! Perfect on a hot summer day. 342 charactersSaulFox, Jan 17, 2016

The beer pours cloudy and smells like a funkified fruit saison. 
The palate follows with lemon and mild sour notes, incorporated nicely with brett and funk characteristics. 
Quite dry on the finish and well carbonated. 
When I did not know what this beer was, I thought it fell somewhere above a Wicked Weed offering and not quite as good as a Casey beer. When I saw the label, it fell about a quarter point short of SARA's Cellarman. 
Overall, a very nice offering from SARA. 610 charactersrodmanfor3, Nov 19, 2015

Hands down best I've ever had. Just a glowing cloudy orange. Gorgeous looking beer. Big blend of citrus fruit on the nose also my with a clear oak. Reminiscent of a white wine barrel. Taste is a bit sour and acidic. Getting a lot of sharp sour fruit but I'm digging. Oak comes in towards the finish. Mixed in, the farmhouse yeast picks it up a level. Tart carbonation. Not aggressive but noticeable. Just truly a great beer. 536 charactersHootie159, Nov 07, 2015

4.24/5  rDev -5.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Bottle from trade. Pours hazy dark yellow with a big fluffy white head. Aroma of tart lemons, hay and straw, a hint of honey, yeasty funk. Flavor is very slightly tart with some dry bretty notes, hay/straw, lots of funky yeast going on here, then a punch of sweet malts on the finish. Body is medium plus for the style, with lightly prickly carbonation. Overall this was excellent, but did not quite reach the levels of the Cellarman I had recently. Really nice, but would have liked just a tad more tart notes. As is, it's a world class saison anyway. Yum.
Adding to this with a Batch 10 bottle on August 3, 2016. This, I assume, has had a bit more time to get tart and let the brett do its work. Overall, this was a slight improvement over an already excellent beer. Noms. 775 charactersBMMillsy, Nov 01, 2015

Nose is salty and lemony with mango notes.  Taste follows nose - light and lemony with a hint of pit fruit and a trace of funk.  Mouthfeel is near perfect - light in body with a bright, effervescent carbonation and a mild acidity.  Overall, nice complexity and deliciously drinkable. 416 charactersJwale73, Oct 31, 2015

A: Beer pours a lovely crisp clear light golden color with a bright white head composed of small creamy bubbled with medium to large ones mixed in there as well. The head is very reminiscent of a beer with wild yeast, soapy and thick with very good lacing. 
S: There is a nice funky nose to the bee when stirred and disturbed. Lightly citric and lactic, reminds me of a good gueuze. Definitely can tell this will be a bright and tart funky farmhouse, can't wait to taste...  Also get some grain and Brett character along with some stone fruit and gentle floral hops.   
T: Lightly tart, gentle and very drinkable. Light citrus flavor with a very interesting and welcoming brett character/funk. Very subtle in flavor yet extremely complex and unique. Beer finished with a very interesting and delicious almost rice like grain character that lingers and tastes amazing. Not expected at all yet works very well with the tartness and I'm loving it. 
M: Carbonation is on the lower side for farmhouse ales but the beer being so gentle and delicate I'm glad the carbonation follows that same trait and does not make it harsh to drink. Beer is dry and leaves a wonderful mouthfeel that lingers and reminds me of rice water, if you've ever boiled rice and drank the water you'd know what I mean... 
O: This beer has a nice nose and flavors are very gentle yet unique and amazing. The feel of this beer and aftertaste is so so unique and intriguing. Overall, I was expecting a completely different beer to what I'm tasting but the actual thing is so different and unique that I'm pleasantly surprised. This is a great day drinking gentle and delicate farmhouse ale by SARA. Now I see what the big deal is... This is an amazing beer and worth every penny of the $18 that It's worth. Thank you Adair and Tom. I will definitely use the yeast in this bottle to infect a sour red I recently made. 1,942 charactersMarioM, Oct 26, 2015

Consumed: 7.17.15
A: 4.5 Pale yellow, fairly clear, with a small, off-white head.
S: 4.25 Fairly mild. Some citrus, a bit of funk and oak followed by some lactic tartness.
T: 4.75 Wow. So juicy and flavorful with perfect tartness. Lots of citrus and apple with a clean, mineral finish. A bit of funk works in as the beer warms leaving a nice, aged cheese element to the finish. Not many traditional saison characteristics, but it works in a beautiful way. 
M: 4.75 Excellent carbonation and mouthfeel. Super refreshing and drinkable.
O: 4.75 Probably the best tart saison I’ve had. The nose was a bit muted, but the flavors more than made up for it. So many fruity flavors you would swear there’s some adjunct in there. 748 charactersTele, Jul 18, 2015

S: Extremely aromatic, with a complex interplay of tart fruit (green apple in particular) and freshly herbal funk (cut grass). Some light peppery spice in the background. Excellent.
T: Tart and spicy up front, with some breadiness providing a substantial base for the funk and fruit midway through. Bone dry on the finish with a hint of hay. Multi-layered and delicious.
M: Medium-bodied and fairly spritzy. 
O: Terrific sour saison, right up there with HF. I was more impressed by this than West Ashley.

I gave it time to warm as I consumed it to get the full range of character. This was not on draft until today, so this is right out of the bright tank, folks. 
A: Cloudy, a bit shy of murky. Bright golden straw color. Minimal head and low carbonation. Did not lace the glass at all.
S: Funk, tart cherries, spices, saaz hops, vinegar, peaches, farm like earthy smells
T: Bite of tartness right upfront, cherry, sour, lemon zest, juicy fruit type flavors in the middle mouth, peaches, pears, sour apples, finishes with white wine type flavors
M: No bite from carbonation, very light on the tongue, finishes dry without many residual sugars. Coats the mouth quickly and then it's gone. 
O: Lovely mashup of a saison with lacto type flavors. Very easy drinking sour/saison and more character as it warms up 866 characterschrisjws, Jun 07, 2015

It's a hair more tart than your typical wild saison, but the finish is super dry and he carb is perfect.  This beer is phenomenal.  Each taste adds a different stonefruit or funk note.  It is certainly unfiltered which leads to different tastes throughout the bottle. 316 charactersPHBoiler, Mar 01, 2015

Pours a very nice pale straw golden color. There is a dense white head that rises up to about 1.5 inches. Nice and dense a bubbly head. 
Aroma is of grain, bready notes and some nice light tartness. Mild yeast sweetness and phenols with some slight fruity notes. 
Taste is grainy with some nice fruit sweetness and good notes of lemon tartness. Mouthfeel is fluffy and dry. Delicious funky, horse blanket and husk notes play very well with the tartness. So nice. 510 charactersJoEBoBpr, Feb 23, 2015

Lemon and citrus, earthy, and straw. Some brett funk and spiciness. Pretty good blend of sour and barnyard. very carbonated, the bottle was a gusher.

There is a delicious creaminess that keeps me interested with the drying Brett. It's not sour, but there's a perfect light tartness that is hard to describe. A musty, citrusy, barnyard, slightly moldy cheese. This is everything you want in a saison. The appearance is a brilliant straw with an off white head that leaves spotty lace. I'll look for this as often as possible. 456 charactersKVNBGRY, Jan 01, 2015

Wheat, funk.
Lemon and tart grape, wheat, yeast, not what I could call sour and on the lighter side of tart. Wish I knew what this was hopped with. Right up there with Dupont, IMO.
Less than astringent, dry, light body, just right. 249 characterspants678, Nov 10, 2014

A- Beautiful hazy straw-yellow body without any hint of impurity. One finger frothy white head with nice retention time. Plenty of lacing that slowly drops into the beer. The hazy colour on this is really, really nice and desirable here. [4.5]
S- Lemon, citrus, grapefruit, funk, a bit of grainy pale malt, and some acidity. This is as complex as you'd expect. It's even more citrus-forward than most of the Hill Farmstead saisons I've had. Almost like it's dry-hopped. Very bright and forward. [4.5]
F- Bright, cockstaggeringly citrus-forward with a nice lemon, orange zest, and even a hint of grapefruit along with a nice musky funk and tart acidity. No sign of yogurt. Just a very clean citrusy saison mixed in with funk and clean acidity. A delight to drink. [4.75]
M- Medium bodied, soft, nicely carbonated with a great funky citrusy finish. Too easy to drink, nice and tart and refreshing. Crisp, effervescent finish keeps you remembering this is alive. [4.5]
O- One of the best non-barrel aged saisons I've ever had. Highly recommend to anyone who has enjoyed Hill Farmstead saisons- this one might outdo all of Shaun Hill's non-barrel aged saisons completely. [4.5]

4/5  rDev -11.1%Bottle: Poured a cloudy straw color ale with a nice huge foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of tart and dry Bretty notes is quiet funky. Taste is also a mix of dry Bretty notes with some barnyard notes easily noticeable with a tart finish.  Body is quite full with great carbonation. Very enjoyable beer but not even sure this is a saison any more considering the amount of funky and tart notes that can be tasted. 433 charactersPhyl21ca, Oct 10, 2014

Thanks to pushkinwow for the bottle!
Pours a golden straw color with a short white head and lots of lacing.  The nose is toasted grain, bread dough, yeast, tart fruit, lemon.  On the palate, light malt, buscuits, lemon peel, tart fruit, grass/hay, floral hops.  Not much Brett here.  A really nice saison! 388 charactersmtomlins, Sep 29, 2014

4.5/5  rDev 0%one of the best wild ales i can remember. loaded with bretty funk and a somehow delicate wheat malt base. its one of those curios beer that seems to satisfy the criteria of a number of styles, but doesnt really alight exactly with this or that one specifically. its pale straw colored and hazy, looks like it should, lacy white head and some froth as it sips. bigger in body but delicate overall, with just enough carbonation and a lazy sort of vibe really. funk and oak up front, new and wet, but refined highly and with a zest of orange peel in there somewhere. malt is medium in dose but robust in contribution, while the yeast is still the primary flavor agent. i get so much dried citrus and white grape in here, but its never even a little sweet. more dry and decaying woody, with a tacky sort of drying but lasting yeast complexion from the brett. so much better than the peach west ashley, so much more happening, and a world class beer. maybe the best saison in a bottle right now? suggest another... 1,009 charactersStonedTrippin, Sep 19, 2014

There is a higher amount of tartness than your average saison, with just enough funk to balance it into a crushable saison.  Delicious, one of the best saisons around. 349 charactershomebrew311, Sep 08, 2014

Appearance is super hazy grapefruit peel yellow with a lovely, compact white head that leaves a great layer of foam after residing. Rocky on the edges with tons of sticky lacing. 
Aroma is of orchard fruits, sticky flowers, and soft spices. Juicy orange, mandarin, peach, and a little apricot. Grassy in a floral kind of way, hay or rustic grass. Some grains of paradise, white pepper, and faint banana also very much present.
The taste reveals one of the juiciest Saisons out there. Loads of orange juice, lemon zest, tart apple, acidic pear, sharo pineapple, white grape, and I could keep going... All that juicy fruit character is properly balanced by some grassy notes, soft spice, and brett yeast leather essence. Amazing almost falls short as a describer. 
Mouthfeel is almost perfect with its light body, medium range fluffy carbonation, and sublime level of acidity. I mean this hits the mark on the acidity level, much like a few Hill Farmsteads. Where a lot of Saisons lack in pucker and others take it a bit far this is just where it's supposed to be. 
One of the best no doubt. Where other truly amazing Saisons fall short, this seems to hit the mark. While I've enjoyed many Hill Farmstead, Side Project, Prairie, Logsdon, Tired Hands, etc. etc. saisons, this one stands out among most of them and up there with one or two others as the best there is. 1,413 charactersMarcWP, Aug 06, 2014

Beer pours a hazy, opaque straw yellow with very little head and no lacing at all. The smell is very nice with a super tart citrus initial smell, heavy funky yeast and some pleasant sweetness. The taste follows suit with a very lactic acid heavy sour that is nice and right on the money. Some sweet corn in the finish, apricot, peach, white wine flavors. Some peppery flavors too with even more tropical fruits. The feel is well carbonated with a medium to light-ish body. Definitely sour on the palate. 
Overall a very well made beer, very worth seeking out. 614 charactersDreadnaught33, Jul 27, 2014

A: Served a cloudy powdery lemon color with a faint white collar for a head.
S: Sharp notes of lactic acid and golden fruits, peach, apricot, stone fruits, and a touch of drying Brett. Earthy and fruity all-around.
T: Powdery yeast, a kiss of dried tropical fruits, stone fruits, minerals, peach, wheat, a hint of lemon, dried grains, spicy black pepper, and earthy Brett. There's a touch of sharp lactic acid in the finish.
M: Medium body, sharp acid but not overpowering, buttery carbonation, smooth, and drying but not a desert. Crisp.

Pouring a clear, light yellow with a dense white head with excellent retention and gorgeous lacing, this is a beautiful saison. The nose is fantastic. A bright blend of fruits with pineapple, pear and peach with an undercurrent of lemon and citrons, this is simply amazing. Honey and mildly floral aromatics are present. A spicy Brett note with Clove, a saison pepperiness and a pils malt base make for a beautifully defined beer. It has some of the mildly doughy and herbal yeast characteristics of a French saison as well. 
The palate opens bright, crisp and lemony with a sweet lemon brightness, a blend of clove and white pepper, a faint almost salty flavor that opens up the palate to the fruit salad that's the mid palate. A surprisingly intense blend of pear, red delicious apples, pineapple and unripe mangoes. Unlike so many fruity saisons that end up having an unnecessary level of sweetness, this is pretty dry. The cracker like base malt character appears on the finish, enhancing the snappiness. Light in body and medium high in carbonation, this beer finishes long, juicy and refreshing with layers of lemon, fruit and yeast accents. Highly recommended, one of the best beers I've had recently. 1,245 charactersDefenCorps, Jun 29, 2014

The beer pours a hazy, golden straw color, quite opaque as it settles, with a large, fluffy, white head that has great retention and leaves a lovely wall of sticky lace behind. The aroma is nice, bits of citrus, bretty funk that brings out a light fruit character, rustic wildflower, pale grain and bits of straw. Very nice harmony between rustic and bright qualities. The flavors follow nicely, very citrusy at the start, huge dandelion-like wildflower, subtle funk, pale grain, straw, hay and light berry fruit at the end from the Brett. The mouthfeel is good, loads of carbonation but it doesn't read as abrasive, nice texture that coats the mouth well, but does have a bit of a prickly bite at the finish.
Verdict: A very nice Saison from Sante Adairius, dry, rustic, bright and refreshing. The Brett character is very well done, not too funky, but not overshadowed at all, very well layered. I'd love for this to be my local saison. 1,045 characterskevanb, Jun 11, 2014

Big fluffy creamy slight fizzy 2.5. finger head, fades back slowly with small pockets and great soapy messy lacing, whisky Very clear golden pilsner color with great streaming bubbles to continue the pillowy head. 
Nose is like a great saison, awesome grainy grassy straw malt, cracked wheat, nice farmhouse funk without Brett funk just great Belgian farmhouse saison, mild spices and very floral, almost flowery. Great fruity notes, little lemon rind and apple skin, nice ester profile, little tart lemony. Mild bready doughy yeast, great balance and effervescent profile. 
Taste starts with lots more great saison flavours, fruity, very fruity, very tart lemony like front, then apple skin, pear, little sour peach like. Then floral notes, flowery grassy etc, with nice wheat and mild grainy malt, pretty light. Nice Belgian saison yeast funk, farmhouse funk with the Brett like funky funk, hint floral spices, etc. Lots of that apple skin and tart stone fruit, and then a big kick of banana too. So complex but all work well together. Finish is dry but a little sticky, more tart fruit and apple skin, little funk and lemon rind lingering. 
Mouth is med bod, little soft, lots of effervescent carb. 
Overall awesome, def one of the best non Brett saisons out there. 1,303 charactersjlindros, Apr 04, 2014

A - Poured into a Kate the Great tulip a very glorious golden hue with a three finger white head that just billows up and didn't quit! Really nice sticky lacing, like a dollop of whipped cream on my beer...just awesome!
S - Aromas of glorious barnyard, Belgian yeasts, fruity esters, light yeast cheese notes, fruits, light spice, light lemon tart, super well rounded and balanced. Just spot on, could use a touch more funk but man oh man it this is great.
T - Taste is nice, really close to the nose, super fruity throughout with the lemon being up front which becomes more peach pit in the middle. Awesome barnyard funk, damp hay, Belgian yeast. The finish is super banana, out of no where! Yet again, wonderfully executed with a great dry finish.
M - Mouthfeel is super refreshing and clean, crisp, wonderfully carbonated.
O - Overall this beer was exceptional, a great example of the style. One of the best. 1,004 charactersrudzud, Apr 02, 2014

Pours a hazy bright yellow-gold tons of carbonation. Wonderful funky bready smell.
Wonderful tart flavor that blankets the tongue and makes you want to drink more and more. Was the highlight of today's tasting. Wish I lived in Capitola. Sante!
Updated 8/16: had numerous times in tap a few poured by Jason the brewer. Just fantastic. I could drink this everyday and still enjoy. 388 charactersunclejazz, Mar 16, 2014

A - hazy, golden orange. Minimal foam for a saison. 
S - perfect yeast and perfect vehicle to showcase the yeast. Bright lemon, tart stone fruit, light funk. 
T - perfect. Lightly tart with a minimal amount of funk. Ridiculously drinkable. 
M - crisp, medium body, fair residual sweetness. 
O - I may be partial as this is my favorite style but this is easily the best non-BA saison I've had and one of the best overall. My favorite SARA beer. 458 charactersEliotRosewater, Mar 09, 2014

M - Lots of carbonation but it manages to be really smooth and coats the tongue. Finish is dry with a light oak presence. 
O - Good funky saison that is more blue cheese and barnyard funk with a mild tartness. The beer is balanced and has a slight sweetness from a fruit flavor 638 charactersjeonseh, Dec 24, 2013

A: Hazy bright yellow color. Bright white three flower head. Very highly carbonated. Fluffy lacing.
S: Brett. Lemon rind. Pepper. Dry. Hay. Barnyard funk. Citrus.
T: First and foremost, punched in the face with that pepper spice and lemon rind fruit. High carb makes this more right through palate. Grass like wheat soft body. Crisp and dry finish. Lingering Brett flavors.
M: Lighter side of medium, high carbonation. 458 charactersinlimbo77, Oct 29, 2013

Pours a murky light yellow with a foamy off-white head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, grain, yeast, spice, and floral aromas. Taste is much the same with grain, floral, and fruity flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of yeast bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is tasty but has a slightly better aroma in my opinion. 615 charactersUCLABrewN84, Oct 28, 2013

4.5/5  rDev 0%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Batch 1: Pours an unclear straw color with a fine white head. Aromas of fresh pale malt. Smells like a brewhouse, in a good way. Light accents of citrus with subtle musty brett notes. Dry crisp malts, straw, grass, mild summer fruit. This is exactly what you want on a hot day. A complete departure from all those flabby sweet American "saisons." A really solid beer in the DuPont vein. 
Batch 2: Pours a tangerine/pumpkin hue with a bright white head. Pronounced tartness in the aroma; lemon and kumquat, some banana. Flavor is less fruity and more bretty at this stage, with a solid funk: cheesecloth, straw, soft phenols. Citric acidity, banana pith, smooth tartness, bone-dry finish with lingering lemony aftertaste. 
Batch 3: Pours an orange-gold color with a nice fluffy white head. Aroma is fresh grains and wort, with a touch of unripe banana and stone fruit. Flavor has a great lemony tartness throughout, teetering on the verge of sourness at times but never crossing over. Mild pale malts are barely there; this is a total yeast showcase. Secondary accents of peach pit and citrus zest. The brett is there, but not in force quite yet, due to the young age of this batch. I still get that lovely brett attenuation mouthfeel, with a pleasant dryness and maybe an occasional wisp of dusty musty funk.
Batch 4: On tap at the brewery. Peachy gold color with a white head. Big tartness on the aroma, sourish clementine notes, banana. Fresh grains, bananas and lemons, bretty chalky finish with a bit of lemon verbena. Dry and a little musty, the brett has yet to take hold. Similar to batch 3. 
Batch 4, again: Different keg than my last entry and actually rather different in taste. This time I get unmistakable apricot fruitiness all over the aroma and flavor, plus more significant tartness. Every time I have this beer I realize that this is what a saison ought to be. Brett, lacto, stone fruit, yogurt, dry and tart. 1,930 charactersillidurit, Oct 23, 2013

Batch 4. Thanks, Chris! Poured into a Lost Abbey teku.
A: Hazed yellow gold with an inch of soapy white froth. 
S: Ripe golden apple, pear, lemon, a hint of sulfur, oak, lactic acid, leather. Musty, earthy notes.
T: Soft lactic sourness up front with a light malt sweetness. Lemon blends with apple and pear. Malt is light and crackery with notes of biscuit and a mild balancing sweetness. Faint oak presence. A little acetic acidity in the finish.
M: Upper light body with medium carbonation. Dry mouthfeel.
Overall: A nice Saison. This brewery continues to impress me. 586 charactersHopHead84, Aug 21, 2013

Cloudy medium copper-orange body. Pinkie finger of dense, creamy, off-white head. Great lacing and retention. Heady, complex nose with notes of honey wheat bread, passion fruit, pear, tart cherries, a dash of powdered sugar and a squeeze of lemon. There's a semi-funky yeast character interlaced with all of the aromas and the end result is fantastic.
Lemon and toasted bread crumbs up front. Slightly fruity, sweetish malt fills in. Tartish edge throughout. Tart cherry and citrus rind sourness pick up near the finish. Wallop of semi-funky yeast notes along with the crescendo-ing tartness. Light floral notes mix in. Dry finish with plenty of lingering tart cherry and citrus along with some faintly sweet fruit. Medium to moderate body with a slightly slick feel. A delicious mix of fruity, funky saison, and tart, refreshing acidity. Fantastic! 866 charactersalexgash, Jul 15, 2013
