4.03/5  rDev -8.2%look: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4Mostly clear orange color with three fingers of off-white head that leave heavy lacing.
Light aroma with a definite floral and tropical element --maybe lychee, maybe mango, maybe papaya -- but delicate and perfume-like.  The tropical note also gives a faint nutty, buttery impression which may or may not be due to the malt.  It's pleasant nonetheless.
Definitely unique tasting, again with the tropical flower thing going up front. Maybe a little vanilla.  A little strawberry.  A twist of lemony citrus.  And then some dull, tea-like bitterness on the backend.  
It's medium to heavy bodied with some slight prickliness in the feel.
This heads in a different direction than most DIPAs.  I'd love sipping this on the side of Kilauea.  It reminds me of this cocktail I had in Volcano once with a Hawaiian flower in it whose name I just can't recall. 853 charactersthebeers, Apr 27, 2017

I got it via a beer trade I can see on the price tag left on that the guy who bought it paid 12 bucks (or $11.99). Why do all prices end with 99 in the US?  Anyway, if I had paid for it I certainly would have thought it was well worth the money.
Look: semi-clear to cloudy copper hue with a one-inch inch white head.
Aroma: it has a wonderful piney and fruity aroma.
Taste: There's some sweetness, toasted caramel, and lots of fruit, grapefruit, peach, mango, and lots of pine to top it off. Quite delicious.
Feel: medium body and carbonation and its juicy. 653 charactersThomas_Wikman, Apr 07, 2017

The malt is prominent with bread and a bit of caramel. Clean and dry on the finish. 370 charactersBuck89, Apr 07, 2017

Look- A deep orange color with nice thick head. The lacing was spread out down the glass.
Smell- Some citrus and grapefruit comes through but the malty alcohol comes through. 
Taste- Very hop forward with a nice blend of the citrus fruits. The alcohol is well hidden making this super drinkable for a DIPA. 
Mouthfeel- Lots of carbonation with a nice crisp finish. 
Overall- A fantastic DIPA without the boozy flavor you expect from a brew at almost 10% ABV. A fantastic change from the NE IPAs I have been drinking. Definitely get this one if you have a chance. 617 charactersKdouble, Mar 12, 2017

4.48/5  rDev +2.1%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5L - pours a striking copper bronze. Reminds me of the last little bit of a summer evening sunset. Rich, boisterous head packed full of fluff and foam. White on top, tan on the bottom. 
S - strong, penetrating aromas of candied peach and mango. Vanilla and resiny pine. Caramel malt. 
T - pure hops. Earthy. Sticky pine and glowing flavors of orange candy and the gooey center of Milk Duds. Loads of malts and hops. Resonating bitterness clashes with the rich, frothy, sweet caramel candy. 
F - like a candy milkshake. This is so decadent. There's definitely a syrupy booziness that is dense as can be. It's like it should be highly carbonated, but all those bubbles are densely packed together for what results in relatively low carbonation and a huge, thick, juicy body. Mmmm...
O - a classic that sets the standard for hopped up IPAs. Has the extreme malt character I love with an assault of oily, resiny hops. This is a big beer. 936 charactersagreenman19, Feb 26, 2017

It soothes the palate with toasted caramel and sweet cream after a nose and front end of intense pepper, vanilla and pine and overall hoppiness. Some may not like the heavy malt back end. But give it a chance. It is highly complex and pretty good by a fire right now. The malty sweetness is balanced by the creamy mouth feel. 428 charactersHop_Swig, Feb 04, 2017

4.21/5  rDev -4.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Translucent amber color. Aroma is hop candy, candied oranges, ripe grapefruit flesh with brown sugar on top, malt, and pine resin. Taste is orange, Apple, and honey on the front of the tongue. As it crosses the mid palate I get darker fruits like dates and dark cherries. The finish is orange peel and pine resin with hop bitterness. Also salt and pepper as it warms. This is a sweet, sticky beer that lingers on the palate, but the carbonation and light mouth feel keep it in check. It's going to be too sweet for some people, but I appreciate the extra flavors the malt brings out. Also quite drinkable for 10.5%. 615 charactersdanh53, Jan 27, 2017

A- Pours a dark amber color with a 1/2 inch off-white head that retains well before becoming a thin ring around the edge of the glass and a mostly full sheet of surface foam.  Semi-resilient lacing leaves tiny specs behind.  
S- Lots of orange peel quality in the nose with a plentiful amount of malt backing.  Noticeable booze fume.
T- Great balance of fruity hops, assertive bitterness and the usual pretzel bread-like malt character all the FFF beers have.  All this along with their distinctive house yeast and very well-hidden ABV makes for a tasty drink.
M- Sharp from the hops with medium carbonation and a body leaning toward the lighter side.
O- It's about time I got the chance to have this beer since I'm an admitted FFF fanboy.  Just like all their other DIPAs, it has an uncanny smoothness to it and a great hop profile backed up by a slightly sweet malt bill.  Would reach for this repeatedly if it was available in my market. 997 charactersImmortale25, Dec 01, 2016

M: medium body with semi dry finish
T: citrus, mango, peach, sweet caramel malt, hints of pepper, pine resin, hops lead up to bitter finish and semi dry finish on the tongue

Taste still leans on a high hop quotient, citrus, not all grapefruit, oh no, you feel like you taste notes of tangerine and mandarin orange along with a hefty malt backbone on this one, its not super dry, this brings some crystal malt, but isn't excessively bitter or syrupy even if it has an above average thickness for style .   Bomber format isn't the coolest and there is no bottle dating but these usually go pretty quick. 599 charactersrodbeermunch, Aug 26, 2016

Smell is resinous with a hint of citrus. You can also tell the booze is present in this one.  Taste is less boozy than the smell, but lets you know it is an IIPA. I get more malt than hops, and some slight citrus finish.
Well crafter double, and one I will seek out again. 361 charactersjphipps83, Aug 25, 2016

Smell is very piney and dank. Lots of earthy aromas and some orange undertones.
Taste follows the nose with strong notes of orange, pine, herbal flavors, grass and earth.
Feel is thick and sweet, smooth. medium carbonation. It's drinks like a DIPA all the way. 
Overall it's a well crafted beer but just not my preferred flavors. 479 charactersFBarber, Jul 31, 2016

This packs a punch. Pretty well balanced. A good beer. Not my favorite from a FFF DIPA, though. Permanent funeral is a little more my style.

Appearance:  A one finger head was poured that reduced to a thin layer.  It is a slightly hazy orange color with good clarity and vision of tiny bubbles coming up through the glass.  Spotty lacing down the glass as the beer was drank.
Smell:  Grapefruit, citrus, herbal, and stone fruit hops followed by  caramel, biscuity, toasted, and nice boozy alcohol.
Taste:  Nice citrus, herbal, and stone fruit hops flavor with caramel, toasted, doughy, and biscuity malts.  Light tingly bitterness and warm alcohol in the rear.
Mouthfeel:  Smooth, medium bodied, medium to high carbonation, a little chewy, crisp, light bitterness, and a little boozy.  
Overall:  Nice balanced DIPA without the harsh alcohol flavor.  Enjoyable and super smooth.  Got better as it warmed up like most other DIPA'S too. 838 charactersFlounder57, Jul 05, 2016

S: Tropical and citrus notes of Mango, pineapple, peach, and grapefruit. With sweet and carmel malt undertones.
T: Getting lots of piney hop bitterness with some grapefruit notes mostly, accompanied by very mild fruity notes, which are all balanced well with sweet malt flavors.
F: Near medium bodied, smooth, good carbonation, with a slightly dry but crisp finish.

S: very hoppy smells pine citrus with a nice malt character easily distinguished from the hops. I really enjoy this ones smell. 
T: hoppy and bitter, citrus, grapefruit, lemon zest. Somewhat crackers and grasslike malt characteristic. Could drink this one all day. Great hop character but is well balanced by malt. Maybe it's because I had this nary a week after bottling. I know others say the malt doesn't balance the bitter but I have to disagree. Wonderful taste. Juicy and malty very good. 
F: full mouthfeel nothing to special but nothing to complain about. 
O: I've had this before when it was less fresh and it did not do the beer justice. I got lucky this time around having it recently bottled it was exceptional. I love this One and luckily I have a second :) 816 characterspuffthestuff, Jun 06, 2016

3.96/5  rDev -9.8%look: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Pours a deep amber orange color with some slight haze. Has a nice, 2-finger off-white head that dissipates quickly but leaves a nice crown around the top of the beer.
The aroma is disappointingly subtle to me. I get some pine resin and grapefruit, and maybe a touch of malts. Very pleasant, just very muted.
The flavor is definitely an intense hop bomb. It's resiny and bitter, with pine and grapefruit notes up the wazoo. My only issue is I'm not getting a lot of balance here. It's just an assault of hops. That said, I enjoy being assaulted by hops. Could just use some malt sweetness to make it not so rough.
The feel is medium bodied with medium-heavy carbonation. Bitter as hell and the bitterness sticks around to let you know it isn't leaving because it can't afford alimony.
Overall, a very good DIPA. It's just lacking in balance, otherwise it would be great. 873 charactersScaryEd, Jun 03, 2016

3.95/5  rDev -10%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4Bottled on 4/1/16. Poured into a teku glass.
Appearance: Rich caramel color with good clarity and a topping of frothy off-white foam.
Aroma: Dried fruits and actually a touch of alcohol.
Taste: Not what I was expecting at all but great in it's own right. The mulled fruit and deep caramel flavors in here are more reminiscent of a barleywine for me. While hoppy, there is a balance from the heavy malt and hot alcohol character. The bitterness reaches a peak during the finish but quickly ebbs away. Aftertaste is quite dry. Actually seems like much higher alcohol than 9.5% ABV.
Mouthfeel: Between medium and full in body with average carbonation for the style. Drinkability is decent but hindered by the very drying aftertaste.
Final Thoughts: Although I didn't detect any of the citrusy/tropical flavors others have described, it still had good flavor. It does a good balancing act of teetering between super drying ethanol bomb and well-rounded brew. It's really not normal. Would I drink it again? Sure. 1,013 charactersJamesMN, May 18, 2016

Pours a dark yellow with some brown tint indicative of the caramel malt used. Smells almost equally of bready, almost chewy, malts with a resin like, piney, citrus hop character. Smells clean with no off flavors or hot alcohols. Leaves some nice lacing on the glass sides. Tastes malty sweet but is nicely balanced with ample bitterness and the hop character as described in the nose. Feels medium bodied. Clean & crisp with that bitter bite at the end. Some waning alcohols in the back of the throat. 
Overall, a Very nicely balanced DIPA. Rare to see this much caramel these days. Sort of reminds me of Maharaja from Avery. Definitely glad to have tried as this is rated #144 out of the top 250 beers on the BA website. 820 charactersjwhancher, May 11, 2016

For lack of a better word "malt bomb".  Alcohol isn't that noticeable. Mouthfeel is slightly thick with medium carbonation. Overall, an okay DIPA. I was pretty underwhelmed and disappointed by this one. It tastes like a 9.5% Alpha King. The best thing it has for it is the relatively unnoticeable alcohol. It made for a pretty easy drinking beer, just not a very good one. 460 charactersMisSigsFan, May 09, 2016

Poured a slightly hazy orange/amber color with a white head
Smelled of citrus, mango, tropical fruit and sweet malt
Taste of citrus, pineapple, a hint of mango and tropical fruit with a sweet malt aftertaste

Toasted malt aroma with tropical fruit notes.  Taste starts off with some malty sweetness and big tropical fruit which is met mid sip by citrus peel and floral hops.  Some nice spicy peppery earthiness in a very dry finish.  Medium silky soft mouthfeel.  It had been awhile since I'd had this one, wow just as great as I remember, so balanced and delish. 470 charactersNolaHopHead, Mar 07, 2016

Appearance- crystal clear dark orange with incredible lacing.
Smell- strong malt presence up front,  citrus, mango in background
Taste-despite malt smell dominance, this beer is not overtly sweet.  Very balanced for an imperial IPA with backend bitterness that makes u want another sip immediately.
Mouthfeel-  more dry than expected,  medium bodied.  Goes down nice
Overall-  a beer I have coveted for a long time.  Enjoyable experience 494 charactersjcflorian, Feb 28, 2016

The liquid is a mildly hazy dark orange color which is full to the rims, minimal visible bubbles. The nose is stuffed with sweet citrus — tangerine, orange, pink grapefruit and then loads of cocoa, malted milk balls, toffee and scone, bitter tea leaf, tar, the pineapple, guava, nectarine fruit scents are think without becoming monotonous. In the mouth it’s full-bodied, heavy enough that the creaminess doesn’t smooth out the mouth feel. Spicy with peppercorn and pine notes, here that muscular grapefruit, tangerine citrus sweetness acts as a calming agent. The florality itself seems mostly citrus blossom. Some cocoa and sweet grains to breakfast breads type of appeal. Not very herbaceous nor grassy at all. The carbonation lends a consistent fine prickle. Ends with full flavor vibrancy and a gentle landing. 992 charactersfarrago, Jan 02, 2016

Smell is slightly dank, with orange, biscuit, lemon candy, and an earthy quality.
Dreadnaught is super bitter and dry, but a really tasty, hardcore and dank West Coast meets Midwest IPA. I get tangelo, grapefruit pith, and faint pine. 289 charactersSabtos, Dec 20, 2015

4.33/5  rDev -1.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25So far, I've been lucky enough to score a few Three Floyds beers from traders, and been slightly-underwhelmed by two of them.  This third one, if nothing else, is certainly the most interesting of the group, though I'm sad I let it get away from me and it's been sitting in the cellar maybe a month or so longer than it should have. 
It pours with plenty of thick, foamy head and crystal clear amber coloring in the body.
If they're going for a tropical fruity, juicy IIPA, they nailed it on the nose...literally.  It smells like pineapple juice, with some hints of apricot and mango.  A bit of resinous hoppy smell off to the side, but fruit is the main contender here for attention.
The taste is something else entirely.  Much drier and more resinous than the smell would have you believe.  I get a bit of dry cider, substantial bitter hops, and a minimal malty backbone, but it smoothes out as the glass sits out a bit, losing bitterness and developing more interesting flavors.  In short, this beer is not interested in balance.  The texture is chewy and thick, the bitterness lingers, and the booze is strong but smooth.
I would definitely try this again fresh.  I want to see if all those fruity hop aromas make it into the flavor on a fresh batch. Maybe someday... 1,274 charactersjmasher85, Dec 16, 2015

Semi, to mostly transparent deep gold. Combonation of soapy and foamy head is so almost tan it is so off white. Decent lacing. 
Aroma is very citrusy and piney.  Sweeter fruits with some significant doughy malts and alcohol. 
Lots of peach/apricot, mango, a touch of orange, and some bitter pine resin. Lip smacking.  The bitterness continues to take over the flavors. A tad boozy. Dry finish. Carbonation is on the lower end, but the mouthfeel is excellentl. Very creamy for the appearance suggests. 
A wonderful imperial, but not up there with APW for me. 583 charactersWesMantooth, Dec 10, 2015

Beautiful honey-orange color, with a hop-forward nose with hints of citrus and sugar.  Palate is balanced - dry hops, some citrus, pine, and malt sweetness.  Mouthfeel is substantial.  Overall, this beer didn't blow me away.  It has a lot of hype to live up to, so perhaps that's not ultimately surprising.  This is, undeniably, an excellent DIPA, but among the best of the best?  I'm not sure I'd go that far. 516 charactersLAp, Dec 01, 2015

L: Poured a dark golden color with about a finger of white head that eventually disappeared. A bit darker than I expected for an IPA that was under a month old.
S: The smell yield straight grapefruit at first with a bit of pine coming through in the background. 3 Floyds hops their beers so much that I can't really smell much of anything other than hops. What I do smell is very pleasant though.
T: The taste, per usual follows the nose pretty well. Huge grapefruit notes, which is indeed different from the new school IPAs that have been taking over the world lately. There is a hint of pine with some of the malt in the background. This is pretty damn good. I've had better, but what I'm having now is definitely great.
F: The fact that this is 9.5% is mindblowing. Not a tinge of alcohol to speak of. It is medium bodied, with a moderate level of carbonation. Overall definitely an easy beer to drink.
Overall: This is a really nice beer. 3 Floyds is obviously highly regarded in the world of beer and with beers like this I can definitely see why. The grapefruit notes are very strong and the pine plays well with the malt in the background. I've only have 2 beers from 3 Floyds (this and ZD) and both have been top notch. I can't wait to try more from 3F! 1,293 charactersRichD, Aug 31, 2015

I might have waited too long to give this a try...  It was tasty, but just didn't quite live up to the expectations that I had for it.  Good beer and certainly worth a try, but I like some of the other 3F's APA/IPA offerings better.  Prost! 256 charactersBowers-Brew, Aug 22, 2015

Smells of ripe red fruits, featuring apple, peach and blood orange, well accentuated by lime rind. Exhibits a resinous sweetness, blending outstandingly well into the beers dough malts. Hoppy fruitiness defines the nose most pleasantly, together with a toffee sweetness on top of it.
Has a lower carbonation, showcasing a powerful mixture of distinct hops and sweet, well pronounced malts, offering the palate up to an extreme, huge but focused IIPA.
Begins with a very soft, aqueous note, bringing riper fruits from the nose to the palate, effectively balanced by bready, slightly earthen malts, which then turn suddenly honey glazed sweet. The prominent malt backbone defines how the hops evolve on the palate from that point on, pointing out features of ripe red apples, mango, water melon pulp and lemon coated peach, still accentuated by a dry earthiness. During the finish, the beer looses its slick sweetness, in favor of a pungent, leafy lemon dryness, pumped up by a bubbly carbonation. Hoppiness reaches its peak at that stage, numbing the tongue for a short glance, returning its initial aqueous characteristic with a well pronounced, long lasting lemon dryness to it.
This is an extreme, and extremely well build, beer. While it inherits typical double ipa features of a resinous sweetness, its tropical hoppiness lurks underneath, waiting just for the right moment to take over the lead. Both ingredients not only blend flawlessly together, but feature an amazing clean, powerful flavor profile on their own. 1,594 charactersaleigator, Jul 27, 2015

Look = 4.5 Pours a clear golden orange color with 4 fingers of thick, frothy just off white head. Incredible retention and lace, like most of 3 floyd’s DIPAs.
Aroma = 4.5 Strong hop notes dominate. Citrus and tropical fruity notes, mild pine and orange rind with a thick sweet toffee and bready malt backbone.
Taste = 4.25 Tropical fruit flavors lead the way complimented with light citrus notes and a hint of pine. All lays on top of a sweet malt backbone of toffee and bready character. Really only a pretty minor bitterness in the finish.
Feel = 4.5 Full bodied with medium to high carbonation; some fizziness, syrupy and mild resin feel.
Drinkability = 4.0 It’s a big DIPA but the mild bitterness makes it pretty drinkable.
Overall = 4.3625 Another great DIPA from FFF, really solid in all categories. 871 characterskbwalters, Jul 20, 2015

4.34/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Original was on tap at Gallo's Tap Room. Edit was from bomber dated October 5, 2015 enjoyed October 27, 2015 in a Hoof Hearted Teku. 
Look - Thin head but weak pour in bar. Light apple juice look with clear around the edges. Thin lacing. Unique.
Edit - Head is darker. Very thick bubbles.
Smell - Pineapple. Orange. Grapefruit. Other citrus. Earth. Resin. Barley.
Taste - Bitter and malt complemented well by the citrus.
Edit - Tea. Vanilla. 
Feel - Carbonation. Medium to heavy. Tongue does curl.
Edit - Medium to heavy. 
Overall - I still want a bomber of it. Not what I was expecting. This borders on being a strong ale. Pick it up if you can.
Edit - The bomber is nice. Closer to triple IPA but that is hard to distinguish with a strong ale. 754 charactersmadelfonatree, Jun 23, 2015

4.66/5  rDev +6.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75I had this beer on tap at a Chicago bar and three days later had a bomber that I brought back to Florida.  The beer that I had on tap was delicious.  You can tell how fresh it was with a strong hoppy smell and taste with the perfect malt backbone.  Tasted orange and other tropical fruit and it was highly drinkable going down very smoothly for a DIPA.  The bottle was different.  Gone were the strong hoppy smells and flavor but the beer was still good with a bubble gum sweetness rather than the orange and tropical flavors.  The bottle version may not have been as fresh and I definitely favor draught.  My ratings represent the draught beer.  If I were to rate the bottle the ratings would be a half of point lower for taste and overall. 741 charactersELS, May 28, 2015

4.47/5  rDev +1.8%look: 5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Bomber into a snifter. Pours a light, hazy amber with a big, billowy 1.5 finger head of foam. Dense lacing left on the sides of the glass. Smell isn't overwhelming, but I got pine, citrus, spice, grapefruit, orange, and pineapple. Light weight, and very creamy, fluffy mouthfeel. Very easy drinking for 9.5%. Pine and hops up front with notes of grapefruit and orange midways. Has a sweet, crisp finish with a tiny bit of malt noted. Piney/citrus aftertaste. 
A very decent beer. Looks great in the glass, and is nice all around. It's very well balanced and hides the abv well (not boozy at all). To me, this is a traditional beer done correctly. While it's not my favorite IIPA, it's probably in my top 5.
For what it's worth, I have a cold coming on at the moment, but I wanted to drink this as fresh as possible. I'd like to revisit this one in the near future when my senses are at 100%. 893 charactersdo_ob, Apr 05, 2015

4.75/5  rDev +8.2%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Highly rated 3-F's DIPA which I really have enjoyed in the past and just tried a fresh one giving it a review today.
A - Dark golden, pale orange color. Nice clarity and a pillow-like white head and strong lacing. Pours pretty thick for an IPA.
S - Strong orange, citrus notes mixed with a full barley tones accompanied by a nice caramel. 
T - Upfront the great citrus, orange zest character is strong and then the malt and caramel washes over your palate. This beer has the biggest malt backbone you can find with 9.5% ABV and a strong hop bitterness making this a delicious beer. The finish is pretty crisp with the bitterness to match the rich maltiness. Though it isn't as rich as a barley wine or as hoppy as some DIPAs but there is great flavor.  
M - High mouth-feel with higher carbonation. This beer is between a DIPA and a barley wine and is quite amazing on the palate with this combination. 
Overall, an excellent take on a DIPA. The awesome orange zest flavor with the big maltiness is a great combination. I do mostly prefer the more hop flavor the better but this beer is a nice change of pace but still has tons to offer. I would strongly recommend trying a fresh one of theses and I look forward to getting another next time I visit the brewery.

2.28/5  rDev -48.1%look: 2.75 | smell: 2.75 | taste: 1.75 | feel: 3 |  overall: 2.25Poured into a Dogfish Head IPA glass
I would like to make a note my beer was FRESH, only roughly 3 weeks on the bottling date.
A - 2.75 - Poured a foggy, murky, honey gold color. Formed a finger of quickly dissipating slightly off-white head. I did not see any pieces of sediment floating around or at the bottom of the glass, so, not sure what's up with the murky haziness.
S - 2.75 - A total malt bomb. Smells like an IPA that has sat for far too long. There are faint traces of peach, mango and hops in the background, but this is entirely overpowered by the intense, almost sickeningly sweet aroma of caramel and malt. 
T - 1.75 - Just as bad if not worse than the aroma. This literally tasted as if you took an orange gummy candy, melted it down, mixed it with orange Triple Sec liquor, added in some caramel and called it a beer. 
F - 3 - The mouthfeel for me was completely irrelevant because of the taste.
O - 2.25 - This beer absolutely did NOT do it for me. I have a HARD time believing the bottling date on this beer was accurate because it tasted OLD. If this is what the beer was actually intended to taste like, then I have no idea how its score is so high, nor how it made its way onto the BA top 250 list. Disappointing as hell. 1,246 charactersBeer-Revelry, Jan 16, 2015

Nose is just awesome with mainly citrus but some tropical fruit--no pine.
Although scored 100IBUs--really not the bitter bomb I was expecting. Malts really keeps the hops in check with predominantly citrus then lighter fruit notes and great mouthfeel.

Smell: This might be my favorite smelling beer I've had recently. The resin just jumps out of the glass. Some citrus shines through after the initial hop blast. 
Taste/Mouthfeel:The hops in this beer are crazy. They hammer your mouth, but it somehow finishes smooth with just slight bitterness. Excellent. 
Overall: Great beer with an unbelievable smell. Will be looking for this every time that I'm within FFF's distro range. 489 charactersKSHunt, Jan 01, 2015

2.98/5  rDev -32.1%look: 3 | smell: 3 | taste: 3 | feel: 2.75 |  overall: 3My notes below are truncated; I'm having this beer as part of my annual Christmas tasting. Reviewed live at high altitude in Castle Rock, CO.
BOTTLE: Brown glass. Branded pry-off pressure cap. 1 pint 6 fl oz.
Side-poured with standard vigor as no carbonation issues are anticipated. Served cold into a Guinness goblet. Expectations are sky high; this is currently #123 on the top 250.
No bubble show forms as it's poured.
HEAD: 2 finger wide. White colour. Nice thickness, creaminess, and fullness. Good even consistency. Nice complexion.
BODY: Clear translucent copper. Vibrant and appealing. Clean; no yeast particulate or hop sediment is visible. Retention is above average - about 4 minutes. Light lacing sticks to the sides of the glass as it recedes.
AROMA: A well-balanced blend of citrus, subtle pine, juicy fruit, mango, passionfruit, pale malts, clean barley, and prominent peach. Seems impeccable, though it could be fresher, juicier, and even more appealing.
Aromatic intensity is mild.
The bursts of fruit are fantastic.
No yeast character, alcohol, or off-notes are detectable.
TASTE: Mango, peach, pale malts, floral hops, faint pine, vague citrus, and juicy fruit. The balance is what stands out. Good depth of flavour. Average intensity and duration of flavour. Complex enough, with adequate subtlety and nuance. But it's not unique or special, and doesn't stand out. I do quite like it. But the rindy hop bitterness gets through the pale malt sweetness far more than it should, turning me off to the brew. And I'd prefer it didn't venture into tropical hop territory to the extent that it does.
Clean, with no off-notes, yeast character, or alcohol detectable.
TEXTURE: Subtly dry but wet enough to refresh, smooth, medium-bodied, well-carbonated, juicy, refreshing, and aptly thick. Complements the taste quite well, but doesn't quite elevate the beer. Presence on the palate is nice, but could be better. 
Not oily, gushed, hot, boozy, astringent, rough, or scratchy.
OVERALL: Quite drinkable. I do like it, but the hop profile isn't ideal for my tastes. I'd like more of an oily resinous build with less peach. I've certainly had better, but it's a lovely offering in the style. I'd certainly pick it up again if I saw it on-shelves. Not a world class offering by any means, and certainly not the 123rd best beer out there, but enjoyable and worth trying.
High C+

10.12.15: 2nd impressions from a bottle in Indiana below. This is now #106 in the top 250.
BOTTLE: 650ml. Flashy loud label art. Purchased at 3 Floyds two days ago. Bottled 10-05-2015.
Reviewed live as an imperial IPA per the label.
APPEARANCE: Head is about 3-4 inches wide, with an off-white colour. Average characteristics. Fluffy. Recedes within 3 minutes. Body is a copper of average vibrance. Has a generic look for its style.
AROMA: Way too much caramalt/caramel sweetness. Hop profile is sticky and oily, with notes of new world tropical fruits like mango, as well as rindy bitterness. That said, none of the muted hop notes are vivid or expressive. This suggests a shallow beer which lacks intricacy and subtlety.
TASTE & TEXTURE: Heavy on the palate, with a filling coating syrupy feel that covers its booziness but is somewhat off-putting especially combined with the overly malty saccharine build. I taste more malts than hops - and this bottle is a week old. Lacks any vivid, deep, or expressive hop notes whatsoever, opting instead for surface level mango, melon rind, and shallow floral notes. In spite of the syrupy caramalt and pale malt backbone, some imbalanced hop bitterness is still present in the third act, scratching and attacking the palate to ill effect.
Poorly constructed, though it does boast decent cohesion. I like this even less than the first time I had it. Neither gestalt nor intricate.
OVERALL: Its goopy syrupy feel and overmalted build make it a beer I find tough to enjoy. The hop profile is lackluster and drinkability is low. I remain confused about this beer's popularity, but maybe it's just personal taste. In any case, I won't be buying it again.

A - light golden amber with a thin head and heavy lacing
S - big hops but more pine and less citrus than I was expecting
T - Solid sweetness from the malt with a big wave of citrus and pine hop over the top
M - Just right - good body with a tight astringent bitter finish
O - very, very good, but somehow not the mind blowing experience I was hoping for. 404 characterspagriley, Nov 15, 2014

4.06/5  rDev -7.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 422 oz. bottle purchased at the brewery, unknown brewing/packaging date, poured into my FFF Teku glass, drank over 30-45 minutes
A: 2/3 - golden-orange coloration, low clarity (cannot read or see through), initial eggshell white frothy head settles into a glass lacing with carbonation lakes, small tight white bubbles emerging off the bottom of the glass, medium-to-large alcohol legs
S: 10/12 - moderate-to-large hop aroma - citrus, grapefruit, peach, mango and pine/resin; moderate bready/biscuity malt and alcohol aromas
T: 14/20 - on the front of the tongue, there is an aggressive slap of bitterness that is slow to abate; this is eventually followed by citrus and tropical fruit flavors in the middle of the flavor profile; on the back end, there is a moderate malt sweetness and alcohol; however, the finish is generally dry
M: 4/5 - thick, chewy body with hop oils and alcohol; moderate carbonation
O: 8/10 - very good-to-excellent DIPA that finds slight flavoring towards citrus and tropical fruit hops - would guess that there is a heavy hand of both Centennial and Simcoe here - but with some balancing but still on the hop end; nice pick-up for $10/bomber but definitely not a 98 for me

Aroma is off the hook, tons of fruit and floral hops. Taste is like a mild version of the aroma, but with a nice dose of malt in the background, texture is very juicy and creamy on the finish.

Aroma is a nice, big nose of hops; noted the peach. Taste is a nice blend of the malt sweetness and hops, again with notes of peach. Moderately carbonated, but too much so. A nice, full, mouth feel and a good drink for its big ABV. 364 charactersdelta490, Oct 10, 2014

4.53/5  rDev +3.2%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a bomber into a willibecher. This was bottled 8/27/14. Review #250 for me.
Appearance: Pours a medium amber and leaves a finger of fairly dense, slightly off white head. Fairly deep in color. (4.25)
Smell: Resin, pine, mango, caramel, hint of peach. Nice balance between the sweet malts and the hops. (4.25)
Taste: Resin, mango, peach, grapefruit, honey, light caramel malts on the back end. Matches the smell well, but the hops come through a lot stronger. Amazingly smooth taste, and the hops shine. (4.6)
Mouth-feel: Medium carbonation with a medium body. Finishes just a tad bitter, which is really nice for such a big ipa. (4.5)
Overall: From the smell, this seemed to be a fairly balanced IPA, but with the taste the hops definitely take over, with the malt sweetness in the backseat. Really smooth, well integrated flavor profile and this drinks like a smaller ABV IPA, but with so much flavor, which is impressive. (4.5) 945 charactersResuin, Oct 02, 2014

4.5/5  rDev +2.5%A:  Pours with a light white frothy head that dies back very slowly.  Sheets of lacing coat the sides of the glass and last and last.  The beer has a pleasing rich amber color that is slightly hazy. 
S:  The citrus flavors are overwhelming in the smell.  Very pleasant and clean smelling.  Lemon, grapefruit are dominant with malt, pine, and hay in the background.  
T:  This beer has a great balance between sweet malt and hoppy bitterness.  At first the sweet malt with a slight hoppy bitterness wash over the tongue.  The citrus flavors are certainly evident, but piney, hay flavors are more in force here than they were in the smell.  The finish is slightly bitter, but with a bit of the sweet malt flavors hang in in there too.  An amazing balancing act between the flavors keep you wanting more.  Very tasty.
M:  Medium bodied and nicely carbonated.
O:  This is a terrific IPA by Three Floyds. 903 charactersimscotty, Sep 30, 2014

4.75/5  rDev +8.2%As you pour you can smell the bready malt and fruity, citrusy hops. It pours hazy amber with a 1” finely bubbled foam cap. This medium full bodied beer exhibits very fine soft carbonation that produces an exceptional creaminess that leaves thick lace. The surprisingly smooth palate starts with a creamy malty sweetness and then some yeast driven light fruits play with the tropical citrusy hop fruits and then the flavors dissolve into a prolonged citrus rind grapefruit bitterness that lingers. The brewer achieves a perfect balance between the big alcohol and the layers of malt and hop flavors. 600 characterspat61, Sep 11, 2014

Nice hazy orange color. Big white fluffy head. Very pretty looking. Not much hop aroma. Mostly an earthy smell. Pretty different smell compared to other doubles I've had. Flavor is bitter at first, earthy, then hoppy. Some caramel flavors. Very well balanced beer. I’m more of a hop forward type of person, but this one is still great. Similar in style to 90 minute, but way better. Easily most balanced imperial IPA I've had. 451 characterskkleu357, Sep 09, 2014

A - The color of this beer reminds me of honey. A medium white head forms on top.
S - Lots of orange citrus aromas. Hemp, pine, garden herbs, and earthiness sneak in to lesser extents.
T - The hops in this beer are both incredibly robust and unique. Like the nose, orange, pine, grapefruit rind, and earthiness wallop the palate in droves. A touch of onion dankness is detected over the graham cracker malt. The finish is delightfully bitter and  fairly sweet, with a hint of grain alcohol.
M -Medium to heavy bodied with a appropriate carbonation.
O - Three Floyds beers always have a fairly unparalleled hop profile that features both citrusy and earthy notes in abundance, and this DIPA is no exception. Not my favorite for the style by a long shot, but it is a fantastic beer! 828 charactersporter_collie, Aug 14, 2014

A: Opaque golden. An off-white 2 finger head that was slow to settle. Curtainy lacing.
S: Hop city! Grass hops intermingled with grainy malts. You can smell the hops a foot from the bottle.
T: Juicy, fruity. Citrus heaven. A terrific balance between piney hops and subtle malts. So smooth and creamy. The more you drink, the more you want. Zombie Dust's big brother.
M: Medium with medium, creamy carbonation.
O: One of the best DIPA's out there. So glad to finally climb aboard the Dreadnaught. Highly recommended. 585 charactersbrewskifan55, Aug 04, 2014

A: Golden in color and very clear. Beer pours a huge head and A TON of lacing lingers on the glass after the head withdraws. Couldn't have been better.
S: Perfect. Absolutely perfect. Smell lots of lemon, orange, grapefruit, apricot and mango (emphasis on the last two). It's practically a hop feast. However, there's a subtle amount of malt in the mix - mostly caramel and amber. I can't wait to imbibe on this.
T: You can't get better than this. This blows all the other DIPA's I've had out of the water. Simply superb balance between malt and hops. Can taste lots of sweet caramel and honey in the malt. These quickly give way to the hops which taste of grapefruit, mango, orange peel and lemon. I couldn't dream of a better beer.
M: Very thick and creamy. The carbonation balances out the thickness, however.
O: Perfect DIPA. 970 charactersleantom, Jul 20, 2014

A - Beautiful honey orange gold color. About 2 and a half fingers of bright white head. Looks quite lovely.
S - Big blast of apricot, mango, peach, green apple, orange, grapefruit, dankness. A small bit of pine gets through, especially as it warms.
T - Same as the aroma but amplified in intensity. A lot of malt plays in this brew. Caramel and honey come through in the malts as well. Very delectable and fairly bitter DIPA!
M - Fairly medium bodied leaning towards heavier due to the malt bill. I usually don't like malt forward IPAs, but it seems to work very well in this one. The magnitude of the hops seems to balance it out better than I would expect.
O - This beer was about as close to an amped up Zombie Dust as I had at FFF. I tried a couple ounces on tap and it was just as good. Three Floyds knows hops. 857 charactersDemoniChris, Jul 06, 2014

Smells like sticky-sweet fruit juice, with lots of tangerine, some mango, pineapple, and maybe even a pinch of banana? This one is hard to pick out, but the sweet malty backbone makes this smell like an earthy, fruity candle -- apart from a bit of alcohol sneaking through.
Taste is pretty much on par with the smell, but has some more complex earthy bitter hop and malt notes playing off all the sticky, oily citrus and caramel malt flavours.
The feel is medium-thick with a slight warmth and dryness from the high ABV. Though personally the alcohol and dryness seem to be a tiny bit overpowering at times, there is more than enough spectacular flavour packed in to compensate. Overall, definitely world class. 798 charactersIan_B, Jul 05, 2014

S - The main hit is grapefruit, primarily zest, with a snappy pine line and hints of mango and lemon and tangerine, and slight hints of wilder hop elements, but nothing that makes this smell like anything but deliciousness.
T - The sweetness of malt is present from the start, as a firm backbone over which pine and citrus play a complicated dance. The middle comes with more fruit elements, fleshy grapefruit and subtle acidity. The close comes with bright but undeniable bitter notes, grapefruit pith, but mingled with subtle malt sweetness, that mitigates what could have been a much more wicked bite, all told.
M - Crisp and clean, with some drying, but surprisingly reasonable given the bursting hop throughout.
O - This is a rock solid, top notch, take no prisoners IPA that still manages to offer enough of a backbone that the fruit flavors sing of flesh, not the white pith that often dominates brews on the cusp of 100 IBU. One of the bombers from 3F worth every penny. 1,131 charactersTsar_Riga, Jul 01, 2014

S - Hoppy, sweet orange zest, some pine, and dank. Smells great.
T - Same as above. Sweet. World-Class. 
M - Solid
O - This is a very well-balanced double IPA that blasts your taste senses.  A very, very, very good offering from 3 F's. I wish I could easily obtain this in Washington State... 373 charactersmabermud, Jun 29, 2014

Appearance is a nice rich Longhorn orange with a creamy head that laced the glass...very tasty appearance. I was highly impressed by this beer's aroma...it was your typical piney-tropical profile but the medley here: mango & papaya & fresh pine really sang. The taste & mouthfeel weren't quite as immaculate as the smell but still lived up to the FFF standards one would expect. The peachy papaya flavor worked with the hoppy body, and the smoothness made the bomber an easy pleasant drinker. 540 charactersESkirv, Jun 19, 2014

S-Faint scents of grapefruit, pine, citrus and some hoppiness.
T-Very drinkable for everything that's going on, not as much hops as I was expecting. Definitely orange and grapefruits.
M-Almost full-bodied but still medium. Once again goes down very easy for this beer.
O-I really loved this beer, possibly more than the Zombie Dust Bottles I have tried (on-tap is a different story). Really want to get my hands on a couple more of these. 470 charactersTmyhre802, Jun 10, 2014

A: glowing, cloudy orange with a bubbly, soapy white head
S: thick, concentrated aromas of grapefruit peel/pith and pine resin are the major players; i also picked up a honey-like sweetness lurking in the background
T: upfront i got light caramel sweetness, and then on the finish i picked up the aromas that dominate the nose; finishes very dry, quite bitter, and sticky sweet

A- This beer has a mildly red amber beer that is rich and robust.
S- This beer has a smell of a slight citrus with some woody nodes with a hoppy finish.
T- It has a taste of hops, hops and more hops. I haven't had many beers that taste this hoppy! I like it!
M- There is a slight fizz once this beer hits your tongue and is bold through the finish.
This beer is a medley of hops, spices and bold flavor. I would recommend this beer to people who are hops fans. I would say this is a "hoppy grand slam" for a lack of a better term. Cheers! 694 charactersSvyturys30, May 19, 2014

The appearance is unremarkable, but with a solid head and fairly sticky lacing. The smell is tropical fruit--not as pronounced and appealing as, say, White Rajah, but still quite good. The taste consists of mango, orange, and lemon flavors, and the bitterness from the hops just isn't here--imagine, a DIPA without bitterness--instead is sweetness from the citrus hops. The mouthfeel is unusual, but not bad at all--this beer is on the thin side (it could pass for a session beer if not for the high ABV) and moderate carbonation. Overall, this is a DIPA well worth trying. 622 charactersDeFaz, Apr 14, 2014
4.79/5  rDev +9.1%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Great beer! There is a serious complexity to this beer. While it has the hop forward properties of any other DIPA's its smooth, and without a lingering bitter finish. There is a bitterness to it, but there is a malt complexity that changes the finish to make it smooth with a hint of sweetness. This beverage got better with every sip. 335 charactersICMTM, Apr 14, 2014

hazy honey gold. creamy head. smelled fruity and malty upon opening but that has passed and now there is barely an aroma(?).
taste is pure nectar. literally. some honey upon first taste, mellow and smooth hop bitterness with a washing back of bread malt... dang this is super easy to drink. 99 IBUs, but smooth. does that agree logically? a slight twang on the finish, but geez, at 9.5%, how much better can a brew be?
again, the comparison of west coast vs east coast. or Midwest.... this stuff is GOOD!!! eh, my parents both were born in Philadelphia so maybe my genetics are predominantly east coast IPA?? 741 characterspkalix, Apr 06, 2014

Now, the flavors aren't as wild and unpredictable as said "B" masterpiece, but they are there. There is enough juice that Snoop Dogg could throw a block party, and it is met by a strong malt backbone like Jack Johnson going 28 rounds.
In the end, it's good, but this player (in his humble opinion) doesn't find it anywhere near spectacular.
Have a good one my children. 553 charactersRaulMondesi, Apr 06, 2014

S-A comparatively 'old school' hop bomb. Dreadnaught is bloated with the good ol' pine and grapefruit tag team. Caramel maltiness helps to balance the nose in some minimal manner.
T-Bitter, biting grapefruit flesh and candied oranges. Freshly grown grass and resinous pine. Straightforward but delectable. A bit of peach and apricot. Caramel malt is more well endowed than I thought it would be.
M-Fuller side of medium bodied. Very bitter. Alcohol hidden well. Aftertaste lingers. Bubbly.
O-One of the titans of the style. Possesses a ton of great flavors and aromas. I prefer my DIPAs to have a bit different flavor profile but I still enjoyed this brute. I can see people literally shitting themselves in shock and awe after their first sip when this beer initially was released. 980 charactersVelvetExtract, Apr 03, 2014

A - HUGE white head, crystal clear, low carbonation, nice lacing, a dark straw pour, really pretty beer. 
S - Grapefruit, orange, mango, a little hint of dankness, and very subtle malt backbone. I smelled this for a solid 2-3 minutes before I put it to my lips. Fantastic smelling beer. 
T - Just a little muted compared to the nose. It tastes great but based on the smell, I was hoping for more of a hop explosion. Follows the nose very closely.
M - Super clean finish. Very mildly bitter. No alcohol presence. 
O - I love this beer. I could easily poured a few bombers of these and forget how potent it is. 645 charactersPSU_Mike, Apr 02, 2014

T/M - The taste is a pleasant combination of a solid malt backbone, and some mango & pineapple.The bitterness hangs around on my tongue for a while. Mouthfeel is medium, good carbonation.
O - Such a solid IPA! Hits all the right notes with me, and I would always have this is my fridge if I could get it here in Vegas. But I can't, so I'm gonna go and enjoy the hell outta this one. Cheers! 602 charactersRizalini, Mar 14, 2014

4.49/5  rDev +2.3%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5A - Beautiful clear dark amber beer that pours with a 1 and a half finger head that dissipates rather quickly. Almost as pretty as Pliny the Elder but lacking the continual bubbly carbonation.
S - Starts off with some tropical fruit and finishes with some nice piney hop resin smell, balanced smell. Definitely get Mango and peach. 
T - Taste follows the smell, still mostly getting mango. Finishes with a perfect amount of hoppy bitterness. Really balanced just like the smell.
M - Not a remarkable mouthfeel, alcohol thin and biting. Not smooth or tingly. Check that, that's how it started out, but it smoothed out a little and the alcohol dissipated as it warmed up from the fridge.
O - Very very good DIPA. Much better than permanent funeral in my opinion. Best attribute of the beer is the balance. Has very well integrated tropical fruits, piney hoppiness, and bitterness. 882 charactersWolberjs, Mar 06, 2014

S - you can smell the hops but you can also smell a caramel like smell and lots of citrus fruit of some sort.
T -hoppy bitter taste with a very fruity taste; slightly citrus, more peach and mango. Good malty backbone.
M - medium carbonation, thick but goes down smooth with a crispness.
O - fantastic beer! I've had most imperial IPAs by 3 Floyd's ands it's one of there best 3. 518 charactersdrdiesel9483, Feb 21, 2014

PF is is a huge and hop forward, while Dread has a much stiffer malt backbone and is built on integrating and balancing the bitter and the sweet. Both styles have their merits, but I'd prob give the nod to the sticky, tropical flavors of PF. Make no mistake, this is an expertly crafted brew. 394 charactersjjdc, Feb 17, 2014

A- golden amber when held directly to the light but it has a redish hue when not looked directly through the light. The head is about a half inch and dissipates quickly into a thin lace.
S- sugary malt, pine, and grapefruit. There's an unknown smell I can't put my finger on it but its not something i usually smell in an IPA. Its good though. Not skunky.
T- bitter up front with a blast of pine and grapefruit while in the mouth followed by a sweet malt that reminds me of a stout. Very interesting but very satisfying. The pine remains on the back of the tongue for a while.
M- slightly carbonated but nothing unpleasant. The bitterness on the back of the tongue hangs out for a while that i wish didn't.
O- this was an exceptional IPA. Very well balanced between malt and hops without losing the benefits and characteristics of either. 883 charactersmlhyatt, Feb 12, 2014

Overall 95/100 
Three Floyds Dreadnaught is an American Imperial #IPA with a 9.5 ABV~ She pours hazy, but brilliant in color, an opaque honey yellow, a color I quite never seen before~ LOADS of tiny bubbles~ Little to no head, yet moderate lacing~ Feel is light to medium, yet remarkably satisfy and surprisingly rich~ Nose is extreme Honey and Pine off the rip, Carmel and Malt linger in the back round, also all your other typical IPA Citrus/Earthy scents~ Taste is just like #heaven, Grapefruit, Honey, Mango, Biscut, Pineapple, Cream, Tangerine, Malt, Peach, Pine, Papaya, Bread and Orange~ Such a sharp, crisp, clean, well balanced, yet intense brew~ No one flavor over bares, its all delivered with a nice creamy balance What should also be mentioned is how much of a 'Malt' presence stands out in what typically is a 'Hop' forward style, awesome surprise by #3F~ 9.5 would never be guessed, as there is virtually zero burn on the back end~ Honestly, if I drowned in Dreadnaught... I would die an extremely happy man~ 1,117 charactersClePaul, Jan 18, 2014
4.42/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Poured into a tulip
A- Pours a hazy golden-orange color with a huge foamy and bubble white head that retains for a while, eventually settling to a floating layer, leaving behind patches of lace around the entire glass
S- Tropical fruit hop explosion with aromas of mango, pineapple, guava, peach and grapefruit peel. Tropical hops are complimented by a sweet, slightly doughy malt aroma, a touch a peppery spice and fresh grass on the finish 
T- Biting hop bitterness highlighted by flavors of grapefruit juice, pineapple, peach and grass. The malty backbone compliments the hop bitterness flawlessly, its slightly sweet and clean. The finish is dry with more citrus/tropical hop flavors continuing to the end 
M- Medium body and carbonation, slightly foamy mouthfeel with a smooth and crisp finish. Drinkability is about as good as it gets for a DIPA, ABV is hidden brilliiantly 
O- Loaded with tropical hop flavor, yet one of the most drinkable DIPA's I've had. This is a great beer that I would gladly buy again if given the chance 1,039 charactersTreyliff, Jan 18, 2014

Pour- Pours a hazy golden orange color. Soapy white one finger head on a moderate pour.
Smell- Wow. Three Floyds description is spot on. Right up front I am hit with the smell of mango. Peaches follow slightly afterwords, not as forward. Hops and perhaps some hints of white grape?
Taste- Basically follows the nose, mongo up front on the taste and then peaches and hop and then a piney bitterness on the back of the taste which dissapates rather quickly. Very tropical and refreshing.
Mouthfeel- Light and fresh, carbonation is spot on in my opinon.
Overall- This beer blew me away, very tropical and tasty, nice and refreshing. I imagine this being quite nice on a hot summer day. 737 charactersSteelSaw, Jan 14, 2014

Orange, lemon, guava, melon. Tropical and citrusy with a nice crispness.

The hops on this beer is amazing, especially with all the alcohol in it. They seem to be the only ones to be able to do that so well. Lots of citrus on this beer. Again you should be careful because the alcohol is high and it is easy to drink. Good mouthfeel, strong nose of citrus styled hops, the taste is really outstanding. It also is a pretty sexy color for an IPA. 462 charactersvinny21bal, Nov 26, 2013

The aroma of hoppy pine, citrus, ripe sweet mango, and passion fruit.
The flavor follows with a juicy mango, pineapple, orange, and then it moves onto a grapefruit and pine. A gentle bitterness that does not linger. Reminds me a bit of Alpha King with its light body, quick bitterness, and then onto a clean finish.
The alcohol is extremely well hidden and does not show 9.5%. The extremely light malt body almost makes it an IPA.
Didn't blow me away, but really well crafted. 558 charactersdar482, Nov 25, 2013

Smells nice and tropical with some musty hop undertones. there is a sharp candy sweetness to the nose. on the tongue this is not all that well balanced. the malt makes a meek appearance but the hops make this quite bitter. having said that, there isnt as much hop flavor as i would have expected. feels a little undercarbonated. this is a little bit of a letdown, but still pleasant to drink. 405 charactersjmaharaj, Nov 02, 2013

It has the worst aroma Ive ever smelled in a Beer. Quite frankly, and for lack of a better term, it smells like dog manure. Im not trying to be contentious but I have to say what I smell. I get no "hoppy citrisness" or anything of the like. I'd bet I'd like the brew better if my nose was stuffed up.
It rebounds with the taste. Very nice. I get the citrus now, and the Hops, and the crispy dryness Its a tad light without a strong after taste but it works. A second pour again shows the thick malty head and lovely lacing, And, the smell isnt quite as bad this time. It goes down very easily for a 9.50% IPA. Its very drinkable.
So its a lovely Ale to pour, swirl, and moon at. Its a very nice drinking Ale with a smoothie complexity, but the smell of it did lessen the experience. Pity.
I'll wait for Zombie Dust first but im starting to think 3 Floyds is going to be a brand I avoid. Nice brews to be sure but worth the money??? I think not. 1,145 charactersUSAF77, Oct 30, 2013

Poured from a 22oz bomber into a tulip glass
A- Bright orange that is pretty clear. Has a big white head that dissipates slowly to a a small film that stays.
S- Big sticky resin with light notes of citrus and pineapple. Slight bitter burn in the nostrils.
T- Medium-heavy bitterness, mostly of a piney nature. Has a pretty hefty malty sweetness and slight toasty malt to balance it out but the hops are there throughout and stay in the aftertaste. 
M- Medium viscosity, nice creamy carbonation. 
O- A really fantastically solid DIPA. Wish I knew how old it was to be sure I'm judging it's profile correctly. What's the point in making quality IPAs if you're not gonna let people know how fresh they are? This reminds me of a supped up DFH 90. Very impressed by the hop profiles of all 3Floyds brews that I've had. 852 charactersPaulyB83, Oct 29, 2013

A - Light coppery gold in color with a bit if a haze. Get a very nice slightly off-white thick frothy head that recedes slowly leaving a thick lacing along the glass.
S - Assaulted in a good way with lots of citrus and mango scents, hops come through with a bit of a piney backdrop on the nose.
T - Lots of hops and a heavy IPA like taste, getting a bit of the alcohol coming through, nice aftertaste with some hints of citrus.
M - Heavy bodied, medium carbonation, mouth coater.

Pours a nearly clear medium gold with a thick one finger white head. Awesome head retention and really good lacing left on the sides of the glass.
Great hop aroma full of tropical fruit. Orange and mango along with some pineapple and tangerine. No malt at all with hops providing all of the aroma. Truly outstanding.
This hop dominance carries over into the taste. A huge rush of juicy tropical citrus that never really goes away. Orange and tangerine along with a touch of pineapple. A very light touch of bread in the background from the malt but it remains restrained and allows the hops to shine. A moderate bitterness and a slight warming in the back of the throat from the alcohol. Finish a pretty crisp and dry considering the abv.
Overall, what an amazing IIPA. The drinkability on this is incredible. I had no idea what the abv was before seeing it on here and guessed it was around 7.5% That's how well it is hidden. Truly a beer to pick up should you come across it. 1,029 charactersrangerred, Oct 03, 2013

Almost a barleywine. Overrated? Yes, by my standards.
A – Pours an amber, slightly cloudy, with less than one-finger of off-white head. Average lacing.
S – Resinous/piney, slight sweetness with some fruit (maybe some grapefruit).
T – Malty, caramel, herbal bitterness, slight sweetness in the finish.
MF – Medium to medium heavy bodied, a dry but relatively smooth finish considering the hoppiness. 434 charactersSludgeman, Sep 27, 2013

A: Nice amber look with the slightest bit of haze. Lots of lacing. 3 finger head dwindles to half a finger and sticks around pretty well.
S: Nice spicy hop bouquet. 
T: Big hop blast to the taste buds, but no nasty bitter bite. Nice crisp after taste that turns into a very nice hoppy and spice aftertaste.
M: Nice medium feel big and bubbly.
O: First beer review I've done in awhile. This was a great beer to kick it off. 456 charactersbaos, Sep 26, 2013

Pours with a large, fluffy / foamy white head over a fairly clear golden-to-amber body with some carbonation flowing up. Plenty of sticky lacing. 
Aromas are sharp up front - Fresh citrus and pine hops dominate. Dark, multi-grain bread quality from the malt. Touch of astringency from the alcohol. The malts become more pronounced as it warms, and even take on some heavy cardboard. 
Fairly thin mouthfeel for the style, but on the heavier side overall relative to a standard IPA. Decent carbonation without being distracting. Flavors are heavy on the hops... lots of grapefruit, pine, mango, and some citrusy aspects. Seems like quite a variety of hops in this one. Caramel sweetness is quite prevalent, but not over the top or distracting. The aftertaste leaves you with solid bitterness, and dry mouthfeel. 
Another heavy metal quality beer from Three Floyds: Complex, high-quality, and pushing the envelope of decency. 975 charactersBeerImmediately, Sep 22, 2013

4.71/5  rDev +7.3%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75I am sitting here in disbelief that I am drinking a beer from the famed 3 floyds...my very FIRST offering from the beer gods of Indiana, sooo excited! 
A: this is one delish looking glass of beer, a thick 1 inch creamy white head, dissipates at a medium rate, clear golden yellow with a slight copperish tinge lots of tiny bubbles and a few big ones as well racing to the top.
S: smells pretty good, doesn't reek of hops like I was hoping but definitely some good hop aromas coming through, many citrusy aromas, some pineapple, slight grapefruit. 
T: very solid. the aromas come out in the taste, very citrusy again, faint hops resins, good malt back bone, nothing overpowers including the bitterness, well balanced.
M: pleasnt on the mouth, the carbonation is medium, right where it should be. has a full body, not watery but not too thick, just right, lacking a little in the slickness that I like on the after effect.
O.A. amazing first experience. I can't imagine that Surly could ever stand up to these guys in quality and price point, I paid 11.99 for this, if it had been Surly it would have been at least 16.99 or more. I wish these guys were outta of MN instead, Indiana can have Surly if only we could get the Floyds in MN!! 1,234 charactersBeerlover, Sep 22, 2013

3.36/5  rDev -23.5%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 3.25 |  overall: 3.25Thanks to Rainblows for hooking me up with this one, something that I've wanted for the longest time but somehow haven't acquired until now. Relatively fresh bottle, Dreadnaught pours out a murky amber and copper-ish color, so muddled and cloudy that it blocks nearly all light trying to pass through. The foamy eggshell shaded head perches softly and leaves behind some nice lace.
Pungent perfume crowds my nostrils with each sip, the kind that an over-zealous teenage girl lacquers herself in to desperately try and attract some over-qualified muscle head, only to achieve the exact opposite reaction - repulsion. Light tropical fruit and an abundance of sweet caramel malt are present as well, but the poignancy of the perfume-y florals cuts through everything and can be quite intimidating. I'm also not loving the seemingly super-sweet malty backdrop.
Blah, and what do you know. The flavor starts off pretty sweet and caramely... this is one, thick, sticky, sweet, and malt-heavy DIPA, that's for sure. The hops do come in quick, and are still quite pungent with big-time floral and perfume notes, almost to a troublesome degree of bitterness and abrasiveness that flirts with the line of enjoyable and just "too much".
No matter the heavy bitterness, however, as the malt blanket quickly jumps back in and smothers everything, taking things to another level of heavy, sticky sweetness that I'd rather my DIPAs didn't go. Buttery, toffee/caramel malt finish, with a big, big, BIG thick coating that will stick to your palate for days if you don't brush well enough. Dreadnaught feels bigger than it should... even at 9.5% ABV, it feels like even more.
Dreadnaught isn't bad. I managed to put down half the bomber without much struggle, but it's hard to say that I thoroughly enjoyed it. I'm not a fan of DIPAs that are sweet and malty like this, and even the "hoppy" aspects were unabashed to an unnecessary degree and a little overdone for my tastes. I guess I was let down, given the incredible praise and high ratings this beer receives. It's decent at best, and overrated doesn't even do it justice. 2,113 characterstectactoe, Sep 16, 2013

Appearance- mellow orange, crisp white head. 
Aroma- Strong hop characteristics up front that are accompanied by noticeable citrus notes. (peach, orange)
Flavor- An incredibly complex beer that many would assuming would be overwhelming to the palate, but to an experience beer drinker this is a delightful imperial IPA. The hop profile is not overpowering, and the citrus infusion is quite wonderful. This is arguably the most citrus I've had in an IIPA that didn't come off as sweet or gimmicky. 
Mouthfeel- Lingering bitterness throughout, medium body, medium carbonation. Wonderful finish. 
Overall- Three Floyds does it again. Outstanding beer that must be tried - a description does not do it justice. It is a strong beer that experienced beer drinkers will love. So happy that I'm now in the Midwest and get to purchase this beer on a regular basis.

Smell is awesome...sweet tropical fruit, my kind of IPA. Mango, pineapple, orange, grapefruit, peach, and a hint of pine and some grassy/leafy qualities. 
Taste is super-smooth; tropical fruit is up front, one of the fruitiest taste-wise I've had. After a quick hat tip from the sweet bready malt, mango and peach take over, followed by loads of citrus and a final pinch of pine at the end. Bitterness, unnoticed til now, is suddenly apparent, and lingers in the aftertaste along with some clean sweetness. A wave of alcohol heat can appear if you savor the beer in your mouth too long, but otherwise it's not noticeable. 
Mouthfeel is well-carbonated and medium to thin. 
Overall, definitely my favorite DIPA of the two I've had from Three Floyds. If fruity DIPAs are your thing, go with this one. If you love piney bitterness, go with Arctic Panzer Wolf. 1,006 charactersBurgeoningBrewhead, Aug 30, 2013
4.89/5  rDev +11.4%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5On tap at the brewpub. What a kick ass place. So much good beer and food, totally worth the trip to Munster!
The half pint is an intriguing burnished gold color with a rocky head that lasts the entire glass. Huge swathes of lace coat the glass on the way down. The second the server put the glass down, I could smell hops. Huge citrus, ripe and juicy fills the nose. Lots of peach, lemon, mango, all over the place. The taste is a total sensory onslaught of hops. Lots of the aforementioned tropical flavors mixed with white grapefruit and some pine, Malt is very meek in the face if the wall of hops. The mouthfeel is quite light bodied for the weight of this beer with a luscious, very active carbonation. Huge bitterness and a boozy edge make up the stupid long finish. Mouthcoating hoppiness for hours.
Dangerously drinkable for the high abv with an incredibly hop intensity. I think this beer lives up to the hype and then some. Must try for any craft beer lover. 970 charactersCAMRAhardliner, Aug 30, 2013

The beer poured a hazy orange/amber color that produced a dense off-white head that was well retained and faded into a rocky cap. The beer's aroma was dominated by the fruity hops with hints of pine hops. The taste, heavy on the fruity hops with perhaps hints of bready malts. The feel of the beer was heavy, almost felt like syrup in the mouth, but I was able to get past that. The bitterness lasted from beginning to end with the alcohol making its presence know. Overall, an excellent beer. 507 charactersPhillyStyle, Aug 29, 2013

A: A role model: Deep amber color with ample fine-grained carbonation rising to a fine off-white, creamy head. The head is perfectly proportioned and very durable. Picture perfect lacing is left on the glass. 
S: Only moderately aromatic for style, with sweet malts and fruity hops nearly in balance. Citrus rind dominates but there is a slight floral element too. 
T: Malty, but with the hops clearly dominant. Orange, grapefruit, some vague tropical fruit and a just a hint of pine. Nice long aftertaste with relatively mild bitterness. 
M: Medium-full-bodied. Smooth with soft carbonation. Really excellent for a 9.5% ABV DIPA. 
O: World-class DIPA. I'd love to taste this along with Hopslam and some other great DIPAs, but 3F is unavailable here in SC. 822 characterschinchill, Aug 23, 2013

As soon as I popped this open I could immediately smell grapefruit. Poured into a snifter a hazy orange/amber. Big bright orange highlights when held to the light. With a big creamy head on top that lasts. Moderate sticky lacing throughout the entire glass.
The smell is unbelievable. It's loaded with big juicy citrus hops. Sugared grapefruit along with a sprinkling of orange juice that smells like it was freshly squeezed. There is tropical fruit as well. Mango...all kinds of deliciousness. There is a touch of pine in the nose too. I sit here smelling this and my mouth just waters uncontrollably. Exceptional!
I almost expected to be let down when I drank this because of all the high praise. I'm not let down one bit and I now understand why this is praised as much as it is. There's a ton of the citrus in the taste that's in the aroma. As I drink this my mouth actually waters after the swallow. A smooth bitterness but by no means overwhelming. Amazing!
I find it difficult giving 5's like this but I try and find faults in Dreadnaught but I have a very hard time doing so. It's medium bodied but coating. Balanced. The alcohol is non-existent in the mouthfeel. Unbelievable!
The drinkability for a beer of this size is downright sick. This my sound cliche but Dreadnaught is very dangerously drinkable. Every sip makes your mouth need another immediately afterwards. Dangerous!
I hate giving so many 5's cause it would mean this beer is almost impossible to improve upon. To tell you the truth it would be almost impossible to improve on. I can't picture a IIPA being any better than this. I haven't tried them all but I've had quite a few and this is at the top of the list. Wow!

A-Lively bright orange color, a bit hazy. There's a big 2-finger head, fluffy white, thick rings of lacing. Classic DIPA look.
S- Some citrus, some pine. Lots of sweet caramel maltiness. Some alcohol. I do not pick up the peach and mango specifically, more of a soft syrupy fruitiness. 
T- Citra hop barrage up against big malty sweets and alcohol. Too much, really. 
M- thick and oily. The hop bite is right away. Malt and boozy finish. The fruits throw in a bit of pleasantry.
A- I'd like to see this one's ABV toned down a bit so the sugar and booze is not so prominent. 611 charactersNiceTaps, Aug 18, 2013

4.25/5  rDev -3.2%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Dreadnaught is clear, a bright medium orange that when held up to light shines...medium orange. On top sits a big, creamy, very light tan head (ecru?). On the glass, there's a creamy ring where it settles and some leggy patching. 
Pine is first and perhaps biggest in the nose, which is also a bit sweet and lightly boozy. Pine goes green and fresh underneath after a moment. Pith and zest of citrus rind come in strongly for more bitterness, balance, and depth.
The taste of pine is foremost and strongest as well, somewhat resinous; but what would be insane bitterness is balanced nicely, rather than feeling like it's been countered. There's something buttery in with the big malts and massive hops, which end up tossing in some more citrus fruits. 
The feel is as smooth as it is crisp, and creamy, with maybe even more smoothness than crispness. There's potential for the body to go this way or that. As it is, it's not dry but a touch comes in to offset the sweetness, the hop oils add depth, and the malts add substantial heft to the body. 1,046 charactersBrenden, Aug 16, 2013

A: Clear wheat color with a light head.

Pours out of the 22 oz bomber a cloudy golden orange with a thick, three finger eggshell colored head. Nice retention with soapy lacing throughout my Spiegelau IPA glass. The aroma is heavy on hops - lots of citrus, hint of pine, with some grassy/floral notes. in addition to the wonderful hop aromas, one can also detect sweet malt and some biscuity notes.  On the front of the tongue there's sweet citrus, toffee, and bread. Dreadnaught finishes with nice bitterness with hints of tropical fruit, rose, grass and sweet malts. Full bodies with a thick mouthfeel and effervescent carbonation. Overall, if this isn't the best DIPA on the market, it's pretty close. Another homerun FFF. 703 charactersJohnG190, Aug 10, 2013

A: Pours a clear amber with a half finger of coarse straw-colored head, which dissipates to a ring and spotted film, leaving no lacing.
S: Fresh hops and lots of malt sweetness. This reminds me most of DFH 90-minute, which is a good start. Maybe a little less sweet, so I'm pretty excited. Lots of grapefruit on this one.
T/M: Starting strong with a citrus bite complemented by plentiful carbonation, this beer is full of flavor. The middle of the sip is characterized mostly by malt sweetness, nicely pairing with the citrusy character from the hops. The finish is bitter with hops... oh so many hops. Mouthfeel is sticky with hop character, well carbonated, and medium to thin, but very nice. Maybe just a little too thin. Alcohol does not show itself strongly.
O: Sure enough, this reminds me a lot of DFH 90-minute IPA. The hop and malt profile both feel very similar to me, except this is slightly more bitter on the finish and slightly thinner in the body. On the other hand, it does not get too cloyingly sweet as easily upon warming, which is very nice. I think for ease of acquisition, 90-minute wins out easily, but if money were not a factor, both were fresh and easily obtainable, I could see myself choosing either brew, but probably favoring the Dreadnaught. A very nice beer, to be sure. 1,448 charactersjdhowe, Aug 07, 2013

Aroma-ripe grapefruit, apricot, brown sugar, orange, slight clove, pineapple and mango as well. Great citrus in here. 4.5
Taste-lots of citrus here. Pineapple sweetness at the front of the tounge. Middle of the mouth hits with some nice sugary malts. The bitterness seems to hit an the end. Pretty darn good. 4.5
Feel-very easy to drink, ABV is absent, medium bodied. 4
Overall-this is a very good DIPA, I would love to do a side by side with FFF Artic Panzer Wolf to see which is better. At this point I would say Wolf has the upper hand. This is still a great beer and worth checking out if you can find it. 4.25 732 charactersscreamking, Aug 05, 2013

Tropical fruit aroma of pineapple and mango accompany sharp grapefruit and tangerine, overwhelming a grassy, resinous character. There's just enough caramel malt sweetness to lend respite.
Muted citrus initially, the flavor becomes more pronounced sharp citrus, turning slightly sweet and caramelly, with a resiny, slightly bitter finish. The balance is toward flavoring hops, with enough bitterness to counter the malt sweetness, but not overwhelm. Hints of onion and fresh cut grass surface as it warms.
Body is moderate and smooth, with moderate carbonation and light alcohol warmth.
Great combination of malt, flavoring, and bittering hops. Fairly balanced in extremes, but with very complex hop flavoring. 790 charactersbarczar, Jul 27, 2013

pours a rich copper color with a big, lasting white head. Citrusy, hoppy, sweet mango on the nose. not huge, just right. Oooooh. Great balance to this beer. Sweet mango/fruitiness at first followed by just a tad of bitterness at the end. hops and malts work together flawlessly. very reminiscent of Pliny, maybe being a tad sweeter. world class taste.

Light citrus, apricot, mango and pine notes. white flowers.
Malt tones offset by the hops. Citrus, floral, pineapple, pine and resin.
Very dry, medium-bodied beer (despite the alcohol level). The hops seemed to lean hard on the bittering side of the equation, to the point of being overly so. Alcohol was well balanced as a result.
Seems a beer that is kind-of in-between, without really taking a position. 515 charactersLibationguy, Jul 14, 2013

A: Beautiful orangish read body with lots of pillowy, creamy white foam. As close to the Platonic vision of an IPA as I can imagine.
S: Very faint, so nothing spectacular came through.
T: Very smooth and none of the initial IPA bite I was expecting. A bit of grassy alcohol taste, but it's masked under something else, including some big orange/grapefruit notes. A more experienced taster would be able to tease out all the complex flavors I know are there.
M: Smooth and rich without being overpowering. Just a little resiny tackiness at the end. 
O: Not my favorite (Hopslam still holds that title), but one of the more perplexing IPAs I've had. Definitely worth investigating again.
Try it again? 4 - Probably 750 characterswaitforit, Jul 13, 2013

4.72/5  rDev +7.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A: Poured into a 3Floyds Teku, a head with tiny white bubbles rose less than 2 fingers tall on top of the golden orange beer. As the foam slowly fell it left a lacing nearly the same hight as the poured head. The beer showed a hint of haze, but otherwise clear enough to see your digits distincly on the other side of the glass.
S: Over rippened strawberrys and blueberrys very promenant and lasting. Floral peach and pine hop flavors are also distinctly detected. Malts are hard to detect or distinguish from the dominant hop nose, but something similar to buttered bread there. Alcohol is detected in the nose but not unenjoyable.
T: Bittering hops start off the beer flavor with a powerful citrus and pine flavor. Those same flavors linger on the pallet after a few sips but with more of a grassy flavor then at first. The malt flavor has a cracker, bread like flavor, not sweet since its being crushed by the bitterness, but the flavor non the less. Clean / neutral yeast not adding much that I can tell.
M: Very dry finish leaving a prickly tounge sensation. A mild amount of carbonation and just a hint of alcohol warming.
O: A very aromatic (when fresh), flavorful and clean tasting Imp IPA. Up there with the best of em! 1,232 charactersguityler83, Jul 12, 2013

Appearance: lightly murky orange hue with with a moderate effervescence and two fingers of frothy ivory foam. Attractive.
Smell: sweet malt aroma with a good amount of tropical fruit character. I love these super fruity IPAs.
Taste: sweet and fruity, just like the aroma. The exact fruits are a bit nondescript; mango, maybe, and some pear? Whatever it is, it is smooth and tasty. There is a bit of a bite to the bitterness, but that's welcome after all the smooth sweetness.
Mouthfeel: extremely smooth and creamy for an IPA, with a medium-thick body and a great, well-integrated carbonation. Love it.
Overall: this beer is extremely well put-together; it's balanced, tasty, and astonishingly drinkable for a 9.5% brew. Kudos. 775 charactersflagmantho, Jul 11, 2013

Appearance: A very cloudy yellow color with two fingers worth of a fairly creamy head. Lacing is here-and-there, but overall, it looks excellent in the glass.
Smell: Hm. Not bad at ALL, but not as fantastic as I was expecting, given other reviews. The peach/guava/tropical fruit are definitely there, but not in as big of a way that I wanted.
Taste/feel: Man... I love the assertive bitterness of this beer. I really, really do. The same fruit in the aroma comes in the beginning of each sip and offers the taste buds a lot of sweetness. The taste of Dreadnaught is what I wanted in the aroma, if you get me. Next is a split second of grassy/piney sorts of hops before finally just going away, leaving a lingering bitterness and warmth at the back of the throat that makes you desperately want another sip to wash that slight warmth/burn away... but then it comes back. So you sip again. And again. And again... Keep in mind that I find that to be a good thing. That's not a con.
My score may not really show it, but I was slightly disappointed with Dreadnaught, despite the fact that I still liked it. A lot. I'd be curious to see what this tastes like out of a bottle to compare. This beer is worth your time. 1,271 charactersSerialTicker, Jul 08, 2013

Aroma: Big pineapple and grapefruit; some sweet caramel and slight alcohol.
Taste: A very nice flavor of candied fruits. Lots of pineapple and grapefruit, as suggested by the aroma. A good amount of residual sweetness, but perfectly balanced with an assertive, but not harsh or astringent bitterness. Alcohol is present, but not hot.
Mouthfeel: Medium-full body with a bitterness that coats the tongue and lingers into the aftertaste. Slight warming from the alcohol.
Overall: This was a great impression of an American Imperial IPA. Perhaps a touch sweet for the BJCP style, but where it misses the marks in style, it surely makes up for it in its intense showcase of American hops. Bitterness is just right to balance and leaves a nice mouthfeel. Wonderful beer. 904 charactersbusinesstime, Jul 03, 2013

4.35/5  rDev -0.9%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25Thanks, Todd! Poured out of a 22oz bottle into a tulip glass. Split with others. Review is from my notes.
Pours a thickened, slightly viscous, syrupy amber color. Carbonation is rather plentiful at first, and about 2 fingers of head coat the top of the glass. There's actually far less lacing than expected, with only a few large droplets coating the sides of the glass before fully vanishing. Head retention is pretty good, as it is with all super hoppy FFF offerings. There's a bit of a glimmer on this one as well, which makes it look appetizing.
Definitely an array of tropical and citrusy fruits immediately reach the nose, but rather than a predominant flavor of mangoes (as advertised), I instead get huge notes of grapefruit, orange peel, pineapple, and that lovely nectarine flavor that I've experienced before with FFF. There's an oily, resinous hopped sensation that is actually rather wet, and indeed, while there is a floral astringency, it quickly becomes covered up by a good deal of the malts' residual sugars. Caramel and toffee abounds, as well as sharp, crisp breadiness that balances out the initial hop explosion. Very subtle stuff overall... Well crafted.
The flavor is even better, taking the initial tropical flavors and melding them further with the breadiness. There's a fruitiness awash with grapefruit, pine, peaches, pineapple, and light lime rinds, only then to transition to a crisp, thickened bready flavor that resembles cracked wheat and creamy, soft barley. It actually took me by surprise, as I expected a hop bomb. Caramel malts are heavily present here (with a dash of honey), and provide a silky drinking experience that contains no burn from the ABV, as well as a light astringency from the hops. A real pleasure to drink - definitely nothing too cloying.
Unlike Arctic Panzer Wolf, THIS is how FFF should focus on making their DIPAs. There's a lot of balance here, and yes, while it is indeed quite hoppy, the bready, crisp malt profile (which is for once not too syrupy) smoothens things out and provides a lot of balance to the beer. Really great stuff - I just wish it wasn't $13 a bomber outside of the brewery (where it is instead $10). I was happy to try it, and wouldn't pass it down again, but I'm fortunate that I have DIPA options that quite similar and good in their own way around here that are slightly more affordable. 2,377 charactersmagictacosinus, Jun 28, 2013

S: WOW! this smell blew me out of the water. Big and juicy. Mango that just keeps going and going. Big tropical fruit, lots of pineapple, burnt orange and some lemon citrus. There is a caramel malt in the background here and a touch of pine but man, the mango just shines!!
T: The hops on this beer are amazing. Once again at the front to f the tongue mango shows up, grabs hold and doesnt let go. Then come the citrus, lemon, burnt caramel orange and pineapple. Towards the middle of the mouth you get a touch of malty sweetness but that is destroyed by the piney, resin hop bitterness at the end. And this finish keeps going and going and makes you crave more. It's pretty juicy. This is definitely a hop forward beer but the hops are all balanced out nicely together.
M: Syrupy, almost full bodied with just enough carbonation. This is very refreshing and surprisingly easy drinking. more please!
O: This was one of my first "religious" beer experiences back in the day and it only gets better every time i have it. The hops shine and it is just bursting with flavor. Probably my favorite beer! /99 1,200 charactersschwemjw, Jun 26, 2013

A - Pouts a golden orange (slightly amber) - fairly clear with a full finger+ of caramel colored head, very dense, smooth looking foam. Lacing is fantastic.
S - Sweet juicy fruits and citrus (mango, apricot, pineapple, peach, lemon) with a somewhat surprisingly sweet caramel malt backbone.
T - So much going on. Consuming at what I estimate to be ~50-55 degrees. Initially tons of juicy tropical fruity flavors (mango, peach) mix with a fairly intense, somewhat astringent bitterness. Very quickly after the citrusy (lemon/pineapple) and slightly spicy flavors kick in. Then the sweet juicy fruits seem to come back a bit and mix with the citrus. A hefty sweet, fairly sugary malty backbone compliment the flavor from beginning to end. The more I drink the more the flavors mix together more at once - which I'm really enjoying.
M - Medium bodied+, appropriately carbonated, somewhat of a sipper, although still quite refreshing.
O - Many strong flavors combine but find a way to balance themselves out extremely well. One every DIPA lover should try for sure. 1,122 charactersMacQ32, Jun 16, 2013

S - Lovely citrus hops peaking through. Can seem slightly candied but there's an array of pineapple, apricot, mango, etc. Very juicy.
T - Bitter hops to start off with and follow with a caramel malts. The citrus is there but somewhat candied because of the sweeter malts. Ends with a bitter finish.
M - Smooth, juicy, sticky... Good amount of carbonation to go with the medium bodied beer.
O - Really a well done Imperial IPA that hits all the right notes. 571 characterscvm4, Jun 06, 2013

4.4/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a slight apricot color, mostly clear and with a fine two finger creamy off white head.
Aroma is quite hoppy, with peaches and apricots coming to mind, but in a candied state rather than fresh picked. There is an underlying syrupy sweetness that overrides the hops.
Taste follows the nose: the bitter hops are present only for a moment as your palate become awash with a candied sweetness and alcohol bringing up the rear. There is a lingering bitterness that still carries the sweetness on the sides of the palate
Mouthfeel is syrupy sticky,brisk carbonation, slightly prickly,warming alcohol.
Overall, this is reminiscent of Permanent Funeral, but with a candied fruit presence and a more pronounced caramel malt presence. A really nice IIPA, but a bit too heavy in the sweet malt department for my tastes despite the big hop presence. Doesn't rank with Lawson's Double Sunshine or Heady Topper. 3 Floyds makes some great beers, yet Zombie Dust is the standout for me. 979 charactersHendry, May 28, 2013

A- Dark gold. Much lighter than you would expect from an imperial. Huge 2.5 finger off-white head. Awesome retention and lacing. The pale color is the only noticeable knock here from an otherwise impressive looking beer.
S- Aroma jumps out of the glass like an imperial should. Huge mango, pineapple, apricots and some lemon. Lots of citrus notes. Juicy as hell as the 99 ibu's smacks around the olfactory.
T- Hop forward from the nose. Hops all over the place, but then the bready caramel malt starts kicking up a fuss. Not overly sweet or earthy like some of the style can be. Balanced. Bitterness comes back again, accompanied by the slight warmth of the alcohol.
M- A true highlight. Feel is impeccable. Smooth, dry, velvety on the palate. Goes down easy...too damn easy. No acidity whatsoever.
O- Hype...yeah. Lives up to it...yeah. Not an overly complex IPA, but nearly flawless. Still couldn't put it ahead of PtE or Hopslam, but it sure gives them a run for their money.

4.23/5  rDev -3.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25Appearance: Beautiful head on the pour, which subsided but was present while drinking. Tons of sticky lacing on the glass as I enjoyed this one. A perfect bright orange color which has all the look a DIPA should. 
Smell: A ton of bright citrus. Tangerines and pine really jump out of the bottle. Earthy resin tones are noticeable on the undertones. The hop bitterness is distinct. The high alcohol content adds a sting to the aroma that keeps the drinker on their toes. 
Taste: Grapefruit and pine greet the palette right away. A very smooth hop presence comes in first on the body and then the hop bitterness settles in on the palette. Again, the bright citrus sets in and really packs a punch on the aftertaste. Waves of bitter hops and alcohol sting continue on long after drinking. 
Mouthfeel: Clean but certainly is memorable. The high IBU's do not destroy the palette on the mouthfeel as much as one would expect.
Overall: One of my favoirte DIPA's. I bought this one right from the brewery so it was incredibly fresh with tons of hop presence. No doubt that this brew showcases the hop mastery that FFF has. 1,118 charactersKFBR392, May 27, 2013

4.17/5  rDev -5%look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.2522 oz bottle purchased from the brewery yesterday. No bottling date, but no doubt they keep things fresh. This is my third DIPA from FFF (Permanent Funeral and Arctic, the other two); so far Zombie takes it. 
A - good looking beer, dark oranges, ochers and ambers. A little sediment in the bottle, but it doesn't get kicked up on the forced pour. Slightly over an inch of foam recedes slowly, carbonation evident from the bubbles rising from bottom to top. 
S - there's something off here. I keep searching for the hop/malt heavy notes, but I get this weird, wheaty, lager aroma right up front. Some sweetness on the back of the nose. It's definitely not unpleasant, but it's not what I expected. 
T - the weak nose is even stranger after the taste, which is really strong. The hop profile is either extremely well-blended or completely unilateral, I can't tell. It hits first as honey and sweet stickiness, later fading pretty quickly into bitterness. The bitterness lingers with the malt, which isn't as caramel-heavy as the bottle suggests. Good, I like beers that take me on a journey.
M - the bitterness lingers a little too much. The alcohol, though high, doesn't play a role, but that's understandable given the IBUs. A little sticky.
O - this is my favorite DIPA from FFF so far, and it's available all year, so I'll be sure to pick up a bottle when I make it down to Munster. 1,389 charactersJamesShoemaker, May 22, 2013

Aroma: Dank and grassy. Smelled sweet honey and bread, with earthiness surrounding it. Pretty decent nose, but not the most pleasant and juicy fruity, like Permanent Funeral is. (3.75)
Colour: Pours a hazy golden orange body with some minute sediment scattered throughout. The head is heckuva fluffy, filling up 3cm of glass and takes 5-10 minutes to recede into a thick 1cm white film. Lots of sticky lacing. Appetizing if not for the tiny sediment flakes floating around. It reminds me a little of Goldschlager... nasty! (4.5)
Flavour: A little citrus, but mostly malty breadiness with a good bitter pine and grass bite. As it warms up, you can feel increasing heat along with an increasing straight up dank sweetness- I like the sweetness but not so much the heat. Pretty good but not mindblowing. (4.25)
Mouthfeel: Pretty smooth medium bodied beer that comes down well. Resinous, coats the palate in pine and earthy bitterness at the end of the swallow. Good carbonation, tasty but not out of this world. (4)
Overall: Pretty good DIPA. It's a bit more drinkable, but not explosively hoppy compared to APW. I remember this beer being a bit better on draft at FFF when I had it last year; it was smooth, hoppy and sweet all at once. It is not a hot mess like some DIPAs can be, which is a nice plus in my book. More balanced than APW, even fresh. Solid DIPA but I'd take a good number of it over Dreadnaught- like Pliny, Heady Topper, Sosus, Permanent Funeral, IIPA, etc. Very good DIPA but FFF makes better beers.

Pours out a very clear golden orange with 3 fingers of white head.
The aroma has huge hop notes; peach, mango, apricot, papaya, citrus with a slight hint of floral notes too. There is some definite caramel in there along with bready notes.
The taste is also definitely hop forward. There are big notes of mango, peach, apricot, papaya, grapefruit and some orange peel with a bit of pine. There is a pretty solid malt backbone too with big notes of caramel and some bread as well. 
The body is medium and the mouthfeel is crisp and clean. The ABV is pretty hidden and only has some warmth as it goes down.
This is a fantastic IIPA with a good amount of balance, but I still love Arctic Panzer Wolf over this. This is a great beer, but I'm not one for balance overall and love an assault of bitterness. Still definitely worth checking out. 912 charactersJohnnyMc, May 19, 2013

Nose has some great hop aromas, hints of citrus a bit of peach an a hefty amount of mango. A nice blend of fruity hops dominate the nose with a slight alcohol booziness.
There is alot of bitterness in the taste which you would expect with an imperial ipa. A small amount of the peach hops are present then are followed by a big hop bitterness that shadows over a Carmel malt background.
Carbonation gives it a nice smooth feel which is coupled with a nice amount of sticky oils from the hops. 631 charactersFcolle2, May 17, 2013

A: Clear copper color with bubbles drifting throughout. A thin ring of white head. 
N: Dried leaves, pine, damp moss. Biscuit and a hint of pineapple. Not very strong, and not really all that appetizing.
T: Really, really sweet. More of that damp grass. Pretty sweet and then astringent. Where are the hops? 
M: Oily and heavy. Lots of alcohol. Needs a lot of work.
O: Really unimpressive. Not wholly undrinkable, but I've given this beer three chances now, and it's been a complete let down every single time. Pass. 561 charactersSarlacc83, May 12, 2013

3.82/5  rDev -13%look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4I know im supposed to be all drooling on the floor and stroking this brew, but it just didn't hit the spot for me like I expected it to. sometimes the hype does you in from the start. this pours a slightly hazy orange bent color, some copper hues, and a couple inches of lasting white head. the nose isn't as hoppy as I expect it to be for the style, its quite fruity up front, slightly tropical, without much bitterness at all. more English style malts in there too than I think the style warrants, which turn into a weirdly sweet finish as far as the flavor goes. the hops are big and juicy, but they aren't bitter or high alpha in the way the alpha king was (that one is definitely worth its hype!). the hops just sort of melt into the malt, which is fine and good, but in a double ipa I want them a little more pronounced than this. fuller bodied and well carbonated, but my mind has already been made up. this beer was disappointing because of all the hype, but that doesn't stop it from still being a top quality brew, it just fell short of that all time status. overall I appreciate the fruity elements and the bigger grain bill, it also hides its alcohol content expertly, but it just doesn't come out hoppy enough to fit into the style very well. 1,255 charactersStonedTrippin, Apr 29, 2013

4.15/5  rDev -5.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25We pour a brew of shining golden-pumpkin orange. It holds a massive two finger head of batter colored bubbles, showing excellent retention. The bubbles are soapy, cakey, and thick, leaving mountains of lacing clinging around the glass. A faint chill haze is noted, without sediment. Carbonation appears to be average. The aroma is bright and fusel, with sticky grapefruit and nectary hops and stinging booze wafting from the time you crack the bottle. Sweetness also comes in the form of warmed honey, pear, pineapple, and coconut shell, while bittered, grainy balance comes from graphite, heavy raw caramel malts, lightly toasted pale malts, sourdough breadiness, and spicy plastics. With warmth comes a curious tomato, garden fresh acidity. Our first impression is that while the beer is initially spicy, and ends with an onslaught of bitterness, the bulk of it is very nicely balanced. As we sip, the taste begins with cold vanilla cake, grapefruit and herbal hoppy bite, oily tree resin pucker, tannic lemon tea, and mango juiciness to cut. Pushing to the peak is more balanced sweetness of white sugar, nectarine, solidly pale malts, and leafy greenness. The finish breaks through quickly, giving proud revival to the initial bitterness of citric hop rind, mineral earthiness, fusel booze, plastics, pseudo-oaky-herbalness, and those same aromatic caramel malts. The aftertaste breathes bitterly of big booziness, phenolic clove and plastics, copper, bready yeast, pale malts, musk, and grapefruit rind hops. The body is on the full side, and carbonation is lighter but nicely contributory. The mouth is coated with oily slickness and sugary sappiness, with quickly following astringency and boozy pucker. Each sip gives nice slurp, smack, cream, froth, and pop, with the lips left sticky and satisfied. The abv is appropriate and warming, and the beer drinks as more of a sipper.
Overall, what we liked best about this beer was its upfront spiciness and bitterness through the flavoring. This was due to not only the herbal, earthy, citric, and raw resiny hops, but also due to the equally as dirty plastics and grit littered about the grain bill. Despite all this, the balance through the center of the sip showed great sweetness to balance, aiding ease of drinkability. The nose also shows decent balance, but as in the nose, the booze comes way, way forward with warmth, pushing you back a bit. This beer is naught for the faint of heart, and while it may not sip the quickest, it is definitely in line with what we’ve come to expect from Three Floyds. 2,564 charactersTheBrewo, Apr 18, 2013

Smell: Green apple, orange rind, and caramel. I really love/didn't expect the apple.
Taste/Mouthfeel: Initially some bitter orange peel and pineapple-like hops. Finishes with green apply, burnt caramel, and smoky tobacco. Superb. Extremely rare for me to give a 5 in the flavor department...but here you go. The apple also makes the feel crisp and clean, but there is plenty of alcohol and body.
Overall Drinkability: One of my new favorites. 532 characterstjsdomer2, Apr 10, 2013

I was super happy when I was randomly given this today. I am very fortunate to know some young and single beer advocates who travel to breweries and am thankful for the overwhelming kindness they show when sharing. Three Floyd's is great, Dreadnaught is not, I repeat, not a bigger version of Alpha or Zombie as I'd dreamed. That said, I like it for its uniqueness. It has some intangible quality that my palate can't pick out yet (I'm new to IIPAs). It is boozy and not as hoppy as I'd have thought, but there's a taste (caramel?) that I need to keep drinking. I may revisit when I convince Mike to share another. It is WAY easy to drink for the ABV, beware! Cheers! 730 charactersBones10, Apr 09, 2013

Taste is pretty much the same. The hops are really understated, though it is pretty bitter and there's a fair amount of booziness too. Mouthfeel was fine, maybe a tad over carbonated and syrupy, but fine. Overall, this beer was dissapointing, given it's BA rating. There is really no individual quality for me to be impressed with. It's a perfectly good, but not remarkable high-alcohol DIPA. I'll try it again if I get the chance, but only to see if this bottle was just a dud, or old. 592 charactersdougfur, Apr 03, 2013

S - Fruity hops. Definitely citrus and tropical fruit. Not really much earthy or pine notes. A little sweetness from the malt.
T - Mostly citrus notes. Not really any alcohol to speak of. Some nice fruitiness here, along with a nice sweetness from the malts. Not really any booze to speak of.
M - Easy to drink at 9.5%. Moderate carbonation. Pretty smooth.
O - This is a good beer, but it's not really a great beer. There's nothing too special about it. FFF is overrated for me, and while ZD is awesome, this just doesn't really do anything special. For the price, it's not worth buying in my opinion. There are plenty of other beers that are at least twice as cheap I'd recommend more. 813 charactersnrs207, Mar 31, 2013

S - First smell is amazing ripe mango and pineapple is unmistakable, very tropical and fruity (wonderful). Bringing nose closer to glass can smell some grain notes very subtle, mostly smell hop profile.
T - Carmel sweetness from the malt hits first followed by an enjoyable high carbonation which lifts the tropical hop aromas to the nose and provides a flavor sensation of sweetness and tropical hop flavors. A pleasant hop bitterness starts to coat the mouth, not aggressively, but in perfect balance with roasted malt flavors and ends with a gentle alcohol warming. Both sweetness and bitterness extend in unison until meet with another taste.
M - Medium body with a bit of slickness which is cut by the carbonation. Tends to coat mouth with a tiny bit of alcohol tingle. 
O - Goddamn this beer is AWESOME, pungent tropical hop flavors with a solid complex malt profile. This beer is bad ass. 1,092 charactersB-Stein, Mar 29, 2013

S - The hops come through loud and clear, with hints of grapefruit. I don't personally pick out too much mango. It has a good malt structure with a touch of caramel that sneaks through. 
T - Great hop experience. I trickles over my taste buds with a piney, resinous hop river of goodness. A good amount of malt to balance it out. 
M - Easy to drink with a medium body and a nice amount of carbonation. 
O - Very good IIPA. It lives up to it reputation. It is nicely balanced. It reminds me a little of Ruination by Stone.

Appearance: Pours a light orange/yellow. Mostly clear with a slight haze. Three fingers of off-white foamy head with great retention. Lots of carbonation bubbles rising in the glass.
Smell: Tropical fruit. Peach. Floral notes. Slight orange/citrus. Malty characters come through at the end. Bready and sweet.
Taste: Big hop bitterness at the front, fading into citrus notes. Sweeter fruit character underneath, peach, pineapple, tropical flavors which blend into the sweeter malt tastes. Finish lingers bitterly until cut by some pine and tropical fruit.
Mouthfeel: Lots of body to this. Very smooth as it flows through the mouth. Little alcohol presence.
Overall: In my mind, this is an excellent IIPA. A great example of the Midwestern take on the style, and one that has become a personal favorite of mine. Unfortunately it can be difficult to find and quite pricy (~$12 per bomber), but I would highly recommend giving it a try if you can pick up a bottle. 1,051 charactershermit990, Mar 23, 2013

Appearance- Clear orange/gold with quick one finger head that lasted shortly. Pretty standard IIPA.
Smell- Big piney/grassy hops. Some peach and white grape smells. Light maltyness. 
Taste- Piney/herbaceous hops up front which leads to light fruity hops surrounded by a nice malt backbone.
Mouthfeel- Mild viscosity. Super smooth and crisp. Light detection of booze

A: pours a slightly hazy golden amber with a 1 finger sense white head. Average visible carbonation. Definetly some lacing on the sides of the glass.
S: what a bouquet of hops. Amazingly pleasant. It makes me think of a candied hop. Very fruity citrus with a great malt backbone to even it out. 
T: To quote the bottle "a hopheads dream" it has a strong hop bitterness that comes off very pleasant. A great citrus and floral blend. Just a touch of malt in the background to provide some sweetness.
M: medium body with ample carbonation. Has the nectar like mouthfeel I look for in a good IPA. Booze is fairly well hidden in the hop bitterness.
Overall a phenomenal brew. Can understand the hype of this brewery a little more now. A must try for any hophead. 807 charactersCloudStrife, Mar 16, 2013

4.25/5  rDev -3.2%look: 4.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25650ml bottle poured into a Three Floyds Teku glass.
The beer pours a nice copper color, clear complexion with a few bubbles rising to the top of the glass. A nice, soft, cloudy white head rises out of the glass, nearly 2 fingers high that has nice retention and leaves behind a nice amount of soapy lacing. The aroma is very fruit forward, notes of mango, pineapple and tart grapefruit with earthy pine behind it, very resinous, some caramel malt character provides some sweetness and alcohol lingers behind. The flavors are very nice, tropical mango, tart grapefruit and lemon, tangerine sweetness brings out some pineapple flavors as well. There are some floral undertones that sneak out as well before the caramel malt and alcohol sweetness take over the finish of this beer. The body is very nice and full, coats the mouth well with a fairly dry bitter finish. 
Verdict: A very nice Double IPA from Three Floyds, but hardly a 'not normal' beer. The sweetness and high octane alcohol hinder this beer a bit and make it harder for the bright citrus and fruit flavors to really shine. Still, this is a very worthy brew that is very much worth trying. 1,153 characterskevanb, Mar 14, 2013

4.22/5  rDev -3.9%look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Appearance: Pours an almost amber golden color…it’ s light golden on the bottom and a dark caramel golden on the top…capped by just off white head about a finger width thick…tons of bubble action in the middle, I can also see some floating sediment…when I swirl it around, the big bubble head tightens up into a nice thick tiny bubble/foamy head…a good lookin’ brew…(4.25/5)
Smell: Fresh and zesty citrus hops, tons of lemon, grapefruit and pineapple…I’m also getting a bit of piney resinous hops aroma as well…balanced nicely by rich caramel malts which hold their own with the freshness of the citrus hops…it’s lively, but I wouldn’t call it overly aromatic…it’s nice though…(4/5)
Taste: Yum! Tons of flavor, holy moly! The first sip is a blast of robust earthy/piney resinous hops flavor and sweet/caramel/toffee/earthy malts…it’s a liquid kick to the face…great flavor…there’s a creaminess to the flavor that is very nice and smoothes out an edge or two…some lemony citrus bitterness shows up towards the end and also a bit of orange peel…it’s a earthy/slightly caramel malt heavy IPA for sure, but everything has a genuine freshness and balance that creates an outstanding flavor…as it warms, the alcohol heat becomes more apparent…(4.25/5)
Mouthfeel: Light to medium body…light to medium carbonation…robust and chewy, this brings heavy earthy bitterness to the palate and well into the after taste…there is a light citrus bitterness also in the background but fades to the dominance of the robust earthy/piney feel…(4/5)
Overall: This is an outstanding brew…one part west coast IPA, one part rich caramel and toffee malt, creating something unique and delectable…it’s definitely a robust I.P.A. and I can feel all of it’s 9.5% ABV, but the flavor is so enjoyable…this is a very popular beer around Chicagoland and I can see why…I highly recommend going to the brew pub/to go store, their beer is much more affordable buying it directly from them…plus you get the freshest product possible…this beer is is a leader in the field and should be sought after by hop heads everywhere…if you see this and haven’t tried it or are travelling down 80 through Indiana, this is a must get…a perfect brew to sit back and relax with after a hard day of work or on a sunny day sitting hanging on the porch…pick up two of these because one is not enough…(4.5/5) 2,443 charactersSerialHiker, Mar 03, 2013

I have mixed feelings mainly because I remember a more gratifying experience with this beer. Still definitely an awesome beer. I wonder how much circumstances effect my beer experiences. 
Smell (4.75) – Super fruity. Orange and a lot grapefruit. Its more of a sweet fruit as well. Not quite as hoppy as I expected it to be in the nose. Some wheaty hint. 
Appearance (4.50) – Wow. Huge frothy head. Lighter golden orange with a slight hue to it. A good amount of carbonation coming to the top. Head subsides quickly and a nice lacing appears to start. Great lacing as I go. 
Taste (4.25) – Big initial hop presence without a huge crunch. Caramel is immediately present to me. The hop crunch comes later towards the end of the body with some sweetness. After a few sips I can find the grapefruit notes a little better, but they're still not as obvious as the smell had me hoping. The bitterness of the hops really sticks around for a while, quite pleasantly. 
Mouthfeel (3.75) – I get a lot of sugary sweetness from this. Alcohol is hidden well, but there is the slightest, and I shouldn't even write about it, slightest hint of boozyness. The carbonation isn't quite as gratifying as I would have liked. 
Overall (4.25) - Obviously a really solid beer. I'm mostly disappointed by the mouthfeel of the beer, as it isn't as gratifying as I usually get from FFF. The smell is downright awesome - fruity armageddon. Looks the par, and tastes a bogey. Its as complex as I would have liked. 1,539 characterscsparace, Feb 27, 2013

S- Strong dominant pine smell, with some grapefruit and light amounts of tangerine. Also get some grass.
T- Flavor starts with light amounts of pine that complements the biscuit-like malt. However, the bitterness of the pine increases over time and ends with drying your mouth. Ends with some grapefruit. 
M- Light body but high carbonation. This is an easy drinker.
O- A solid beer from Three Floyds. I'm not a big hop guy but the alcohol in this makes it easier to drink. 608 charactersEfay, Feb 23, 2013

Pours a hazy amber/copper color with a huge white foam head. Major staying power and tons of sticky lacing.
The aroma is beautiful pungent, dank hops and fruits. Peach, mango, orange, pine, caramel and big malt. Loving the wet dankness each whiff. 
The taste is big on the bitter side. The hops definitely pack some bite but there is a big rush of malt that counterbalances the bitterness. Citrus bursts on each sip. Total salavation on the buds almost instantly after touched. Big bitter grapefruit/orange rind aftertaste. Long lasting. Amazingly drinkable.
Big and full-bodied mouthfeel. Very smooth for all the IBU's.
Overall I am very much impressed with this. The dankness whiffs and blasts of citrus was very enjoyable. 9.5% is not there. No way. Way too dangerously drinkable and though it may blow out some palates, I polished off this gem and was sad there wasn't more in the area. I am spoiled living in the Bay Area with the abundance of amazing IPA's but this, my friends, is a worthy find and should be searched out. Thankful to have had the opportunity to try this. 1,215 characterskaseydad, Feb 16, 2013

Appearance: Pours a fairly hazy golden orange with a moderate amount of bubbles. About two fingers of white head that fade into a thin creamy layer. Leaves a good amount of lacing around the glass. 
Smell: A big citrus hop aroma with a nice backing of soft malts. Big scent of citrus up front with good hints of orange, grapefruit, mango, pineapple, tangerine, and some peach. Also some grass and a little pine in the hop mix. Bready pale malts with hints of soft biscuit, caramel, cracker, and yeast. Also some hints of honey add to the sweetness. A citrus forward and juicy aroma that is not overly bitter smelling. Very good aroma.
Taste: Like it smells, a big juicy taste of ripe citrus hops with some bready malts. Sharp and fairly bitter taste of hops upfront with big notes of citrus orange, mango, grapefruit, pineapple, tangerine, papaya, and peach. Some earthy pine resin. Soft bready malts with a taste of cracker, biscuit, caramel, and yeast. A little taste of sweet honey with the malts. Nicely juicy and pulpy. Good citrus taste with just the right amount of bitterness. Really good taste.
Mouthfeel: Medium to full bodied with a moderate amount of carbonation. Creamy, juicy, and slightly chewy. Pretty smooth and the alcohol heat is hidden very well. 
Overall: A very good imperial IPA. Great citrus flavor and balance. My first 3 Floyds brew and I'm looking forward to trying more. 1,463 charactersMattyG85, Feb 16, 2013

Pours a mostly clear, medium-light golden orange. Half a finger of white head, good retention, fine lacing. Not bad.
Smell is nice, but I expect to be bowled over by hop aromas, and I'm not. Sweet, with candied fruit against a soft background of pine. I like what I'm getting, but it's faint, and I want more. As it warms, more tropical fruit emerges, juicy and sweet.
The taste of this beer is unlike any DIPA I've encountered. It's powerfully sweet, without the bitter blast. Tastes more like a hoppy barleywine than a DIPA, with the malts and the residual sugars dominating the flavor. I like it, but I'm struggling with that IPA label. Where's the bitter? It's there, though faint. On balance, the tastiness overrides the unconventional nature.
Feel is quite pleasant. Medium-bodied, sticky, with carbonation that pops and zips, rising and fading in a parabolic arc.
I like this beer. But it's not all that hoppy. I tend to like IPAs with a hefty malt bill to balance the hops, but this one is more malt-heavy than even I want. I like the beer, but the hop character isn't as potent as I want. Lots of "buts", which says a lot about it. It's really good; it could be a whole lot better. 1,302 characterszeledonia, Feb 16, 2013

I live less than an hour from Russian River Brewing Company and love Pliny the Elder. I now understand why this ale from Indiana gives them such a run for their money. 
Citrus, pine - everything I expect from a big West Coast IPA... except it is from Indiana!
Nice amber color with an off-white head - lacing stretches down the glass as you drink.
Nice mouth feel, although it seems a little less carbonated than Pliny - nothing wrong, just a little different. 
I would love to taste it on-tap!! 
I've had Artic Panzerwolf from 3-Floyds and loved it - I have a friend that lives 20 minutes from 3 Floyds... I will be visiting him (well, staying at his house while visiting 3 Floyds!!) 757 characterssheepdog87, Jan 30, 2013

Pours hazy orange with a full one finger of fluffy white head that cakes on the lace where it rests. 
Aromas of sweet citrus orange, pineapple, mango, papaya and a little bready malt sitting in The background. Good stuff. 
Taste is a delightful bitter fruity hop bomb full of mango, orange, peach, slight citrus peel, challah bread, white peppercorn, lemon zest, wet grass, biscuit, a touch of apple and a dose of alcohol. Drinks very easily for 9.5% abv. The sweet fruit dominate but every sip seems to reveal another layer. 
Mouthfeel is slick, rich, oily medium full with appropriate carbonation to keep those flavors lively once they coat the tongue. Long bittersweet tropical fruity finish. 
So happy to get a full bottle to my greedy self! I've had a couple bottles shared before but this is a pleasure to sit back and enjoy on my own. This has to be one of my top five imperial IPAs. It's bitter, sure- but so much more with all those delightful tropical fruits backed by layers of sweet "balancing" malts. It might not be for everybody but I highly recommend that you try for yourself and decide. ISO! 1,202 charactersThickNStout, Jan 21, 2013

Aroma has citrus and pine, some caramel maltiness
Flavor starts with as burst of bitter hops but a strong malt presence helps to balance it out a bit. Lots of fruit - orange, grapefruit, peach .slightly bitter finish that lingers a bit
Mouthfeel is creamy yet sticky Medium carb and a nice solid body dry finish. 
Overall a top notch imperial IPA. If this was sold in 4 or 6 packs it would be a mainstay in my fridge. Unfortunately its $13 a bomber and not too easy to procure.  A nice treat to enjoy over a Sunday afternoon though! 636 charactersmaxcoinage, Jan 19, 2013

3.99/5  rDev -9.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4For some unknown reason I've been avoiding this brew. I have an open mind, feel good and this will share my company whilst I relax.
Aroma for me is simple and pleasant. I indeed pickup on mango and whafts of pine. To me, not alot of citrus. Frothy head quickly dissapates.
Moderate hop rush followed by semi-sweet maltiness.
Coats mouth in a classic DIPA fashion. Trace bitterness quickly dissapates.
I find this brew's maltiness makes it a more enjoyable sipper. Not a hop 'assault' I was expecting or even read about. "Where's the hop?!?" Is this batch suddenly different? Sitting on the shelf or backroom awhile? I believe more the latter. Wish FFF would date stamp there btls. Also, I would like to see this in 6pk form. $10.99 22 oz not worth it--sorry. Too many great DIPAs out there---this brew---been there, done that. 830 charactersjoeseppy, Jan 19, 2013

4.28/5  rDev -2.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Poured 22oz bomber into tulip glass
A- pours slightly hazy orange with a nice single ginger head, great lace
S- fresh pine, floral, citrus, orange, some caramel 
T/M- starts off bready, dark fruit, moves into pine flavor with the orange coming through on the after taste. I get some strawberry too. Great texture.
O- this is the second time I've had this and I didn't review it before. Honestly I was going to trade this bottle but I'm glad I didn't. It's a double IPA and has those typical DIPA smells and tastes but this is a little more on the floral and tropical side, not too boozy, very enjoyable. 604 charactersbrewtus, Jan 12, 2013

Aroma smells of mango, peach, grapefruit, and pine. I wish I could say the flavor was as fruity and complex as the aroma; alas, I find it difficult to discern much besides the bold flavor of pine resin. Grapefruit is appreciable, granted, and some bready malt does come through in the finish once the hops have subsided, but it's a struggle to gauge anything more. This IPA is true to form, with over-the-top hop bitterness relentlessly accosting the taste buds. If you love DIPAs, you'll probably love this. I don't love DIPAs, so this doesn't do much for me. 681 charactersMaximalC, Jan 05, 2013

Pours a beautiful clear golden orange color into a tulip, 1.5 finger head, modest retention, great lacing.
Smell is deliciously citrus-y and juicy. A little pine in there. 
Taste is outta this world- orange, grapefruit, blue pine, light barley malt flavor, perhaps a taste of caramel. Nothing else to say except it's absolutely divine.
Mouthfeel is great- medium light bodied, moderate carbonation, a little resin. What can I say, it's incredible. Get it if you can- and get lots. 622 charactersHopdaemon39, Jan 04, 2013

Easily one of the best Beers out in the market. i was very excited to see this on the shelf at the local Acme. The beer gives off a great floral aroma that is pleasing to the nose. As far as tastes goes, you better be expecting a hop bomb to go off in your mouth. Very grape fruity. However, this one goes down very smooth. 355 charactersAmish_Ambush, Dec 31, 2012

Poured from a 22 ounce bottle into a CBS snifter. Served chilled...
A) Hazy copper brew with a good finger slightly off white head. The head slowly settles to a dusting and then a thick collar. Nice lacing...
S) Quite a lovely nose,full of really sweet tropical fruits and light citrus. I think a little bit of pine as well.
T) The hops and the malt really appear to be in perfect balance with this particular beer. This starts with such nice tropical fruit sweetness. Feels like there's just a kiss of honey as well. Then finishes with a piney kind of grassy alcohol tingle. It's just really nice.
M) Full-bodied with moderate carbonation, feels supple, very smooth, right up to the finish, which has that tingle I mentioned, but really a very easy drinking beer.
O) Okay Dr. K, you were 100% correct. I can't believe I waited so long to drink this beer. It is one of the best Imperial IPAs I've had the pleasure of drinking. Absolutely fantastic, and I would certainly recommend it to any hop lover. 1,047 charactersRoamingGnome, Dec 28, 2012

4.5/5  rDev +2.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Picked up a 22 oz. bottle of Three Floyds Dreadnaught Imperial IPA at Kimbark Beverage Shoppe in Hyde Park, Chicago about a month ago (just getting around to this review now). The price was a bit exorbitant–$10.99 for 22 ounces! This hop monster was enjoyed in my Chimay goblet. 
Appearance (4.5/5): Dreadnaught pours an orange-copper hue and is topped by an inch and a half of billowy white head that lasts for quite a while. The beer is fairly opaque. Dreadnaught has a near-perfect look for an IPA with its nice color, opacity, and luxuriant foam head. Quite nice. I also really like the colorful and inventive label design–very, very cool. 
Smell (4.5/5): Dreadnaught has an intensely citric nose of orange, pineapple, grapefruit, and passion fruit. Some pine is also mixed in. The aroma has a sharpness to it that lets you know your palate is in for some serious punishment...I don't know about you, but that gets me excited. Little malt can be detected in the aroma; the hops dominate completely, predictably. 
Taste (4.5/5): The foretaste is almost startlingly sharp: flavors of grapefruit and orange citrus, mango, tart passion fruit and pineapple come out. Nice complexity. Strong pine notes dominate the long finish. Slightly acidic. A light alcohol warmth can be felt in the finish as well, and it accentuates the beer's 'bigness' and intensity. I love the varying hop flavors that are expressed at different points. This may be one of those rare hoppy beers that I find ALMOST overwhelming. Words cannot effectively convey just how intense the flavor is. 
Mouthfeel (4.5/5): Medium carbonation and medium-heavy body. This baby truly throttles your palate with sharp, thick, oily hop juices. The sharp and prickly hop flavor is just a notch or two below cloying–if you're a hop head like me, you quickly learn to love it. 
Overall (4.5/5): Dreadnaught is a truly outstanding hop wallop of a beer. It exhibits all the best characteristics of an Imperial IPA; it's a hop head's dream and perhaps the most intense hoppy ale I have ever come across (perhaps even more impressively hoppy than Moylan's Hopsickle). If you can find it, buy it. 2,158 charactershagbergl, Dec 26, 2012

This one has eluded me for a while, so I was glad to finally try it.
Poured a mostly clear, darker amber color with a puff of foamy white head; not a whole lot in the way of retention or lacing. Aroma was about as expected, fresh and hoppy, citrus, pine, some tropical fruits. More of the same in the taste, a bready malt base was present but obviously dominated by hops, citrus, pine, tropical fruit, stone fruit, decent balance of sweet and bitter. Lighter medium body, moderate carbonation, alcohol mildly detected, but overrun by hoppiness. Very good IPA overall. 645 charactersRifugium, Dec 18, 2012

Poured a nice 2 finger thick and foamy head with good lacing that had great staying power to the end. Very inviting. Color was golden orange and clear on first pour but on 2nd pour got hazy from sediment. I wasn't expecting that but did not seem to effect taste.
Smell of fresh citrus and herbs. Clove at first but then I picked up mango. Nice aroma to the end. Surprised at how strong it lasted.
Tasted pine, dried orange peel. Then picked up the mango and maybe peach. It's not heavy on hops up front or on the linger. Not overpowering, nice for me because I am not a hophead.
Mouthfeel is clean and fresh. Dry finish that doesn't linger bitter. Not a lot a carbonation, smooth and gentle.
Overall I would go back to this but I would not seek it out for myself again. Nice change of pace for me. I am glad I took 3Floyds advice. It is one I would send to a hop lover. 995 charactersDMarlinJ, Dec 10, 2012

Average IPA color and texture I was not "wowed" by it aesthetically. The aroma was nice, hops and citrus but as the label said I was detecting mango. The taste was simple at first but as I delved deeper I was more and more impressed. Obviously heavily hopped this IPA is smooth and light yet tasty. I got mango and citrus flavors but the hoppiness blended well with both. I enjoyed Dreadnaught immensely but more so the deeper I got into the bottle. 584 charactersKYGunner, Dec 09, 2012

I've been waiting for sometime to try it and I waited with baited breath as I popped the top and pour a beautiful golden amber, clear brew with 4 finger fluffy eggshell head that took some time to settle with excellent retention and spiderweb sticky lacing.
When I walk through the pearly gate this smell may greet me with amazing mango, melon, grapefruit, orange, lemon zest citrus notes. The taste is equally heavenly with sweet caramel malts to start then super smooth mellow citrus hops that are bold but not overwhelming and a fantastically relaxed moderately bitter finish which was surprising considering the robust hops packed into this beer. A true masterpiece and up there with Pliny the Younger, Heady Topper, and Hopslam for a contender of my favorite DIPAs.
This may be the most drinkable of my favorite IPAs and certainly the most mango I've had in a beer, I'm so glad I have two more bombers to sip on! 982 characterswilliamjbauer, Dec 07, 2012

Appearance: Three Floyds year-round imperial India pale ale pours a shockingly light golden/brass color that is quite at odds with most beers of this style. There is a small, one to one-and-a-half fingers of white, soapsuds head that bubbles like a hotspring, something this drinker has not beheld in any beer to date. This is curious, as there is no overly active carbonation to be seen. The head has medium to low staying power, and leaves a bit of lacing behind, but nothing to write home about. There are some alcohol legs, but with the high 9.5% ABV this is to be expected. The beer’s haziness is nice, and the color is attractive, but some more head and more staying power would be nice.
Aroma: Huge citrus notes dominate the nose: mango, peaches, pineapples, oranges, and lemons are all over this beer, but they do not entirely destroy the malt presence. There is a nice, sweet caramel backbone that complements the fruity, hop bitterness. Still, make no mistake, this beer smells to be extremely hop forward. This one is called Dreadnaught for a reason, apparently.
Taste: Fruity and palate destroying, this beer is delicious. It approaches and matches levels of bitterness akin to Stone Ruination, Founders Double Trouble, and Three Floyds’ own Arctic Panzer Wolf. It tastes of hops, hops, and more hops, along with the fruitiness alluded to in the nose, and a smooth but extremely subtle caramel malt backbone. There is more malt here than in Ruination and Arctic Panzer Wolf, but not by much. The aftertaste is bitter as Hell, too. This beer is, as the label boldly proclaims, a hop-head’s dream beer.
Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel on this goes along with the taste in being pretty much perfect. The carbonation is wonderfully middle-of-the-road: not so much that it is like champagne, but not so little that it seems flat. The feel is not overly syrupy like many other IIPAs, and goes down so smooth that the drinker will hardly notice the bottle slowly draining. Of course, at an insane 99 IBUs, this beer has plenty of astringency and it lingers like no beer that has passed these lips apart from the aptly named and frequently aforementioned Ruination.
Overall: This beer is wholly worth the hype and the current 98 it holds on Beer Advocate. This is one of the great IIPAs out there, and the fact that it is of year-round availability is wonderful. If this one is out there on your shelves, and you are a hop-head, do not hesitate any longer; pick it up now. The only real downside to the overall package is the package itself: it comes in a 22oz, which ends up being a bit daunting to take down; Dreadnaught indeed. 18/20 2,669 charactersTHANAT0PSIS, Dec 04, 2012

Appearance: Golden/amber with some lively carbonation and a nice 1 finger head.
Smell: Mango and citrus. Very nice
Taste: Wow, insanely drinkable for this high of abv. Hop fruitiness up front smoothly transitions over to the clean, balanced end. What an end it is, with some lingering bitterness but malt to accompany it and this makes it quite pleasing, with a nice breadiness to it. This actually reminds me of FW Double Jack, but it's definitely not the same. The difference is that this beer showcases the unique fruity hop flavor that is present in many of the FFF brews. Lots of flavor profiles going on in this beer. Another great thing this beer shows about FFF is the complex flavor transitions that end smoothly, with no bad/lingering/funky aftertaste. Too easy to drink for the strength...awesome.
Mouthfeel: Syrupy with a moderate amount of carbonation.
Overall: This might be my favorite FFF beer to date, there's something really cool about how hard the hops hit you, but then fade out into a smooth finish. Good stuff. 1,072 charactersPsilohsaiBiN, Dec 02, 2012

Great beer. Smells piney with sweet citrusy hops shining through. Started with more of a malty characteristic but the citrus flavor came through as it warmed up. I would only drink this at a warmer temperature going forward. Alcohol is barely present. A great imperial ipa from FFF. 316 charactersRimbimhoot, Dec 01, 2012

4.5/5  rDev +2.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5just opened the bottle, smells like funky high end weed. Surprisingly pale color, like a very deep yellow with some orange/brown. Giant sticky white head. Even with letting this beer breathe, still smells like sticky weed. Fruit scents begin to come forward, dried apricots and peaches. As the beer really has time to air out and the smells escape, smells like lightly toasted bread with a tropical fruit marmalade seeping into your bedroom to wake you up in the morning.
Took two sips to have the hops hit me and wow, this beer is attacking my mouth. Alcohol heat doesnt hit until you take a few breaths after sipping a few. Probably the most tannic beer i've ever had. Still feeling the resin tingle my gums 5 minutes after the sip. Sweet jam like fruit on the tip of the tongue followed by huge rolling malt flavor. Caramel covered fruit bowl rolls into super hop resin. Oily hop flavor covered the back of the tongue. Bitterness is brash and bold and hits stronger after you finish swallowing. 
This is a giant beer. Not as complex as I expected to be, nor was it that super west coast ipa i expected it to be but that might be a good thing. This is another beer I've discovered on my chicago trip that proves that there's a midwest style ipa. Not nearly as fruity as a west coast ipa, but not as dry an english ipa. It takes the midwest ipa and make it huge, and it's beautiful. 
Big, simple, tasty, and the hop bomb you want from a DIPA. 1,446 charactersjtierney89, Nov 27, 2012

Pours a nice golden slightly burnt orange color...nice sticky white head. Aroma is just amazing...mango, grapefruit, pine hop. Taste is a hop burn for sure...strong sweet but powerful cirtus hop, but also lots of mango and pine. wow....this is a great DIPA.
It does burn...but in a good way. 
Overall this is a fantastic brew and so glad I finally came across it. So much hop, so much sweet malt, so much flavor...really great. 512 charactersDrinkSlurm, Nov 27, 2012

3.91/5  rDev -10.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Thanks to maximumu13 for this one. Reviewed from notes. Poured from bomber into a CCB pint glass.
A: Pours a slightly hazy, light gold with good visible carbonation and a big, three-finger craggy white head.
S: Pine, grass, resin, onion/spice hops, with a backbone of malt sweetness.
T: Bigger on the resin & onion/spice hops, and the bitterness from these is most noticeable on the front of the tongue. The flavor is more malty than expected, and comes across as a caramel flavor, but this doesn't add much sweetness to the overall impression.
M: A bit of a chewy mouthfeel, and somewhat heavier bodied than most IIPAs. Good carbonation sensation, and only a hint of alcohol.
O: This is far from a bad beer, but I'm just not a fan of the hop profile. The malts could have added more sweetness to make it a less bitter, more balanced IIPA. And I'm still not a fan of caramel malts in IPAs. That said, I would drink another if offered. 939 charactersmacrosmatic, Nov 23, 2012

Aroma is typical FFF. Bold and hoppy. Mostly citrus and tropical fruits with a little bit of caramel sweetness and a tinge of grapefruit.
Similar flavors to the aroma. More soft citrus and tropical fruits than anything else. There is also a bit more sweet bready malt than I'm used to in the style. Good, but could use some resiny or grapefruit flavors to provide more bitterness.
Very creamy mouthfeel with carbonation levels a shade below medium. Works very well with the flavor profile.
Highly drinkable for a high ABV beer and very good. I still prefer APW any day to this, but still top notch. 734 charactersjmarsh123, Nov 05, 2012

S: Warm tropical fruits, bright orange aroma. Bready, sweet caramel.
T/M: Blend of intense pungent hops. A distinct vegetative hop taste. Malt taste reminds me of a stale bagel cooked too long in a toaster. 
O: After drinking several Three Floyds over the past week I am realizing why consumers fall heads over heals for the brewery. There beers all consist of a unique yeasty character with an intense fresh hop character. 495 charactersOne2Remeber, Nov 03, 2012

Three Floyds dreadnought pours a golden hazy color with about a finger of creamy head. Great lacing all the down on this one. The smell is classic FFF, but as intense as I thought it was going to be. The taste is juicy hops up front with a nice malty sweet backbone that is balanced with just enough bitterness. It's got a thicker body then some of west coast DIPA which gives it a creamy mouth feel. Dreadnaught really leaves you wanting more after each sip. As always, FFF doesn't disappoint. 527 charactersThedaver4220, Nov 03, 2012

Poured into FFF Teku glass
Appearance: Hazy orange, copper, yellow. Gorgeous two finger bone white head with small tight bubbles that dissipate quickly to a ring that invites rising bubbles to join it along the edges of the glass. There is lacing as the head made itself known on the glass. 
Smell: Well here is FFF awesome signature citrus hop profile with orange, grapefruit, mango, pineapple and a bready malt. 
Taste: Again this is so very typical of a FFF IPA and follows the nose showcasing the citrus notes but up front I'm getting more sweetness than I've noticed in their other IPA's. Don't get me wrong it's bitter but I get an initial sweetness for a fleeting second on the tongue. Then the citrus hits mid palate and then the bitter notes take hold and follow through to the swallow. 
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with a surprising creamy smoothness. I noticed the creamy quality right away and this one does coat the palate with all its great bitterness. This does feel sticky to me but in a good way because I feel like this adds to its ability to coat my mouth with it's hops. 
Overall: I seem to say it every time I try a new FFF offering, especially one of their IPA's but they just do not disappoint! This is highly drinkable for 9.5% as the abv is very well hidden. Another one knocked out of the park! 1,358 characterssleuthdog, Oct 29, 2012

Head dissipates fairly slowly and leaves a nice lacing. Just smells amazing. Tons of resinous mango, pineapple, peach. Also tropical fruits like papaya or something like that. Very sweet smell from the carmel malt I imagine. Taste begins with an abrasive bitterness. Then fades nicely into a mouthful of tropical and citrus fruits. Finishes with a fruity, bready, sweet malt. All the while that bitterness is lingering around. The sweet, bitter fruit finish sticks around. Nice creamy mouthfeel and is full bodied. Such a smooth tasting beer. 619 charactersSamichlaus82, Oct 24, 2012

piney, grass, caramel, honey, grapefruit. Very hoppy on the nose, just the way I like it.
a nice bitter spicyness up front, subtle sweetness follows from the malts, and a slight citrus grapefruit finish.
a lighter medium body for a dipa. Nicely carbonated with a nice warmth from the abv. Creamy on the lips.
another great imperial ipa from 3F. It's a seriously hard decision choosing which one is the best from the 3 (apocalypse cow, arctic panzer wolf, and this).. Each one has their own characteristic that makes it a fantastic beer. 643 charactersfacundoCNB, Oct 24, 2012

S- Fresh hops and citrus. Just an awesome well balance of hops from flame out and dry hopping. 
T- Wonderful, taste of grapefruit maybe. More importantly the hops are a big and giving the big boom of bitterness that blooms into even more hop flavor. I haven't like a Imperial IPA hop flavor like this since Hopslam. 
M- FFF has a great way of making beers that are so thick that it actually changes how the carbonation works in the beer. This beer is another great example of this. It's so thick, that it seems a little under carbonated until the end of the sip when the carbonation comes in huge. 
O- Solid solid solid beer. It has to be one of the best Imperial IPAs I have had the pleasure of drinking. I'm not saying it's the best, but it has to be up there. 850 charactersMeowTom, Oct 13, 2012

A - A tad hazy. Color is burnt golden orange. Lushy and frothy white head that's nice and thick with a creamy like lace. Head stays true throughout providing a fair amount of stick.
S- Fresh hoppiness. aroma of pine and citrus hops. A faint fruitiness to it with a small hint of sweet malt. A touch of spice within.
T- Mango fruitiness up front paired with sweet peach notes. Both pine and citric hoppiness flow big over the taste buds. Oily hop flavor really lays down a nice spice character. sweet caramel malt notes really balance nicely. Almost a buttery character. Finish is a hop headed bitterness with some spice and a small lingering sweetness.
M- Thick and smooth. Pure FFF! Very drinkable as the alcohol doesn't knock you in the mouth. It just splashes the mouth with a sticky world class thickness. Just a complex flavor that's enjoyable and easy to drink. 
O- A perfect double/imperial ipa from a perfect brewery. This is a world class ale and is as of right now the best imperial ipa I've ever had. It has the look and flavor thats incomparable. Very complex and tasty. Something both hop heads and just craft guys both can appreciate. If you can appreciate the quality of this ale than you need to stop reviewing. This double ipa was crafted and brewed to perfection. You don't find brews made any better than this. 1,431 charactersBradtheGreat7, Oct 08, 2012

Great looking IPA - hazed burnt gold body packed with slow and steady beading, a couple fingers of paper white head fill the glass. Great retention and lacing.
Reminds me of Sculpin in some ways... thick mango/pineapple that begins to lean towards citrus as it warms. Some faint toffee type malts beneath all of that, hard to really decipher though. This is all about the hops. A bit sweet and syrupy, juicy fruits.
Holy bittering units batman! Bitter hop qualities shine right at the front end of the drink. Tropical fruits and citrus to follow, the bitterness remains and clings throughout the finish, drying out the palate. Some subtly sweet bits of banana and peach. 
Delicious liquified hops in a glass. 763 charactersyamar68, Oct 05, 2012

Carbonation is flawless to match such a solid brew. DAMN 3F does the IPA right.

The aroma is intensely hoppy--lot of grapefruit, some spicyness, pine and underlying sweetness. The flavor has a lot going on--loads of piney grapefruit hop flavor upfront with bready, boozyness mixed in. The hop bitterness is sharp and assertive and acts to dry the swallow with lingering hop flavor and hints of booze well after the swallow. The carbonation is moderate and medium-full. Overall one hell of a beer--love how the hops work with the underlying bready/boozyness. More please. 633 charactersuwmgdman, Sep 22, 2012

This beer looks pretty tasty, by all indications of its clear amber color and nice white head that leaves a good lacing on the glass. The nose follows suit suggesting a great piney, fruity, bready aroma. The taste is where it throws me for a loop. I get the fact that Three Floyds wants your tongue to be like scorched earth with this beer and makes no apologies for making such bitter beer, but bitter beer is not good beer in my opinion when not backed up with a malty backbone. It's a strong beer but needs more body and more caramel malts to sweeten it up a bit for all the hops they used. The malt the beer has in it is good as if you try to get pass the bitterness the caramel comes through, but it's so hard to distinguish through all the bitterness.... just needs more balance. Nice medium body and well carbed, overall nice beer just not balanced at all. 889 charactersProspero, Sep 21, 2012

S - Loads of juicy stone and tropical fruits. Apricots, peaches, lychee, mango, papaya, candied citrus, pine, doughy sweet bread.
T - Just an onslaught of tropical and stone fruit. Papaya, peach, and lychee seem to dominate. Candied citrus, mango. A soft caramel malt backbone marries perfectly with the hops. Green pine seems to grab onto the edges of the tongue creating a slow build of bitterness that carries through the finish. The finish is more pine/grapefruit forward and dries out nicely.
M - Thick dense body, low to medium creamy carbonation. Dry finish.
Juicy would be one word to describe this beer. A very complex mix of aromas. Dreadnaught seems to be more dedicated to the aroma and flavoring hops while still providing an impressive bitter finish. This reminds me of a hoppier Maharaja. Wish I would have picked up more. 974 charactersStaveHooks, Sep 14, 2012

A: Deep, deep orange in color with a finger of white head. Foam stays around for a while with a fresh bottle. Great lacing when the head subsides.
S: No doubt the best part about this beer. Intense citra hops right away. Smells of fresh sliced orange and grapefruit. I wish I could use this beer as an air freshener. 
T: Very smooth right away with the hops hitting first then the usual FFF's malt to mask the high abv. Goes down very smooth, the hop bitterness does not linger. 
M: Medium mouthfeel with the appropriate amount of carbonation. 
O: Should set the standard for all DIPAs. Very deserving of the hype. I'm glad this beer is easy for me to obtain. One of my favorite beers, FFF's best IMO. A must try. 766 charactersHopCat12, Sep 07, 2012

S - Scent of fresh tangerines and citra hops. Very fresh and crisp scent. The overall hop profile is dominant. Unlike the typical west coast variety thereis no pine scent but rather a more floral smell.
T - Blend of citrus and hops. This is a DIPA lovers dream because of the complexity and depth of fresh hoppy goodness. Finish is not as bitter as one might expect. The tartness of orange and tangerine balances this to a level of excellence.
M - the defining characteristic of Dreadnaught is in its drinkability. So smooth it is insane, masking of a high ABV, and redices the bitterness to a very nice level. I'm impressed.
O - I brought a bombert of this back to NY from Chicago and the tasting group loved it. 3F's is deserving of the hype with this beer. Right there with Pliny, and just as hard for me to get again. 943 characterssocon67, Aug 27, 2012

4.18/5  rDev -4.8%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Pours a substantial 2cm head of off-white foam, composed of small to medium sized bubbles, fairly dense in packing. Head retention is pretty solid for a 9.5% ABV douple ipa, lasting a minute or two, gradually fading to a thin cap of foam atop the body. The head leaves substantial lacing in its wake, which is augmented with each sip. The beer's body is a transparent golden orange-brown color, with light bringing out bright orange and yellow hues. Carbonation is readily visible, percolating from the center and sides of the glass.
Aroma is like that of inhaling deeply from a bag of mixed citra and simcoe hop pellets, just a very nice and intense blend of grapefruit, tangerine, and peach, with a bit of a caramel malt backbone behind everything. Very pleasing, though the aroma does dissipate fairly quickly.
Taste blossoms with flavorful hop combinations atop a toffee-like malt center. Hops impart, upon opening, some peach and orange flavors. By mid-palate, grapefruit and citrus bitterness become more prominent, with peach and apricot being most noticeable hop flavors in the back. Toffee-like malts remain in the background through each portion of the palate, with ethanol being detectable in the mid and late sections. Closes out with slight caramel malt on back of palate, with modest ethanol. Lingering aftertaste of hop bitterness, peach and apricot esters, and toffee malt sweetness.
Beer is medium to medium-heavy bodied with fairly aggressive carbonation that foams the liquid across on the palate. Resulting mouthfeel is fairly creamy, somewhat smooth, but overall flowing and not excessive in any single direction. Expectedly dry in close, with little stickiness around the edges of the palate. 1,717 charactersfalloutsnow, Aug 14, 2012

Pour: Hazy orange with a finger and a half of white creamy head. Head sticks around pretty well, and leaves some solid lacing as well:
Smell: Tons of grapefruit, tangerine, orange. Some honey/caramel sweetness is in there, but hops are center stage for sure.
Taste: Tons of grapefruit and tangerine. A light pine resin, but only enough to add another very welcome level of complexity. Malts provide a wonderful light caramel sweetness, maybe a touch of honey. Finish is very juicy with lots of grapefruit and oranges. A bit of peppery bitterness as well.
Mouthfeel: Incredibly juicy. Carbonation is absolutely perfect. I'm a really big fan of the citrus and white pepper bitterness that sticks around. Pretty darn drinkable.
Overall: Haven't had this one since I started reviewing, and its even better since my palate has evolved. I love this beer, and I think it goes round for round with Hill Farmstead. 965 characterscfrances33, Aug 05, 2012

Absolutely crystal clear with a moderate amount of carbonation. There is a one finger creamy white head, it's a stunning looking beer.
I'm really only smelling citrus here but it smells so good. I'd say say it reminds me of sweeter fruit with this aroma.
I taste sweet citrus fruit, also able to pick up a carely malty presence as the beer nears room temp.
The beer is mouth coatingly smooth with bitter hops followed by a sweeter malty presence and leaves behind a nice citrusy aftertaste.
An outstanding beer overall, there's not one thing about this beer that I don't like other than its hard to find. 714 charactersJCaweinstein, Aug 02, 2012

4.31/5  rDev -1.8%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Bomber poured into a 16oz tulip. Thanks to Matt for this one.
A - Pours a nice, vibrant amber, with a touch of haziness to it. Off-white head of soapy foam that settles to a thin skiff. While not the best head retention, the lacing is as thorough as I've ever seen, with tons of sticky suds clinging to the glass after every sip. Awesome looking beer; as well as bottle design, name, and even the cap is cool. Good stuff from FFF.
S - As expected, a tropical hop explosion. Bright, fruity hops; mango, pineapple, grapefruit, orange, and a touch of peach. Earthy pine looms underneath. Big, robust malt character of toasty caramel, buttery bread, and biscuit. Exactly what one would expect form this brew.
T - A huge DIPA for sure. Intense, pungent hop blast that just assaults the palate. Mango, pineapple, and big grapefruit as well. Orange marmalade and a subtle hint of peach. Huge, resinous pine presence that dominates the finish. Massive hop character, but a robust and pronounced malty side as well. Big caramel malt, with buttery biscuits, bread and toasty notes as well. Finishes with assertive hop presence that dominates the profile with the force of all 100 IBUs, as well as a notable alcoholic presence. Massive, but still drinkable.
M - Fine but prickly carbonation right off the bat, with a rather creamy, medium bodied feel. Intense bitterness linger on and on. Given the IBUs and alcohol content of this beer, it remains surprisingly drinkable.
D - This was the first beer I've ever bothered to really seek out via trade, and while it was by no means a let down, my tastes have simply changed since I started my search. I find the intense bitterness and boozy character of most DIPAs (and Barleywines for that matter) to be too abrasive for my palate (Yet I can't find an imperial stout too big to enjoy). While this definitely nears abrasive territory for my palate, I still find it very drinkable and very tasty. I would compare this DIPA to Lagunitas Hop Stoopid, as they deliver comparable citrusy hop blasts but also present a fair degree of balance and drinkability. An absolutely superb beer from Three Floyds, but admittedly, it didn't quite live up to the hype for me. 2,199 charactersConverge, Aug 02, 2012

Smells like mango,pine, and citrus. Very fresh and inviting. Slight alcohol esters as the beer warms a little.
Tastes of a very well rounding IPA, the caramel malt backs up the intense hoppiness quite well. The drinkability of this beer is surprising given its high ABV
Mouthfeel is typical for this style of beer. The hops leave your pallet wanting more. The dryness is satisfying; the reason why I love IPA style beers.

A- Pours a hazy brownish orange-gold with about a finger of white frothy head that recedes to a thin layer. About average carbonation.
S- Mango citrus hops with some pineapple, papaya, and a caramel malt background with some light spices. A little bit above average aroma strength.
T- Mango, peach, a little bit more pineapple on the finish with some caramel malts, light spices, and a light sweet citrusy aftertaste. Very light bitterness.
M- Medium bodied, very smooth, head adds a little bit of a nice creamy feel, about average carbonation, abv very well hidden.
O- This was a very good DIPA. Definitely up there with some of the better ones I've had, but probably not the best. Had a nice balance between the mango hops and the caramel malt backbone which resulted in a smooth and very flavorable DIPA. An awesome year round offering from FFF.

Golden with great clarity. A solid hop aroma with toasted malt in the background. The flavor follows with a mix of citrusy bitterness, tropical fruit flavors, toasted malt and a nipping alcohol. It's very creamy and has a nice, subtle carbonation.

3.98/5  rDev -9.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 422oz into a tulip. Pours a hazy glowing orange w/ a thick frothy head, great retention, sticky lacing, minimal carb.
Aroma is a burst of sticky tropical fruit, flowers and honey. Grapefruit, peaches. If there's pine in here as other reviews suggest, it's a different kind of pine than what I'm used to. Aroma is ooey gooey but kind of a mishmash.
Taste is heavy on the malt with boozy, caramelly undertones. Resinous hop bitterness provides a sharp counterweight to the mango, peach, citrus and booze but the sweet fruity combination of caramel and pale malts nearly overwhelms everything else.
Mouthfeel is thick, chewy w/ a bitter, flowery, resinous aftertaste that lasts and lasts.
Overall this is much heavier on the malt than I like in an IPA and the alcohol is poorly concealed. An interesting take on a DIPA, but not one that I would seek out again. 860 charactersdraheim, Jul 01, 2012

Mouthfeel- fairly full body but very easy drinking. Considering the amount of hops it doesn't feel like your tounge is sticky after each sip.

If you are iffy about big IPA's or extremely hoppy beer - you will want to pick something else. If you are a hop lover, you really need to try this.
Poured from a 22oz bomber into a pint glass.
A - Pours light brownish orange with a 1 finger head that recedes quickly and leaves some nice lacing.
S - Hops. More hops. VERY piny All I can smell is pine resin and oranges.
T - Whoa! This is scorcher. The hops hit you right away, but in a good way. This is probably the most intense, hoppy flavor I've ever experienced. Definitely "not normal." The taste is very much like the smell. Oranges and pine cones, but overall very refreshing too. The only reason I didn't give it a 5, is because the hops are almost too overpowering for the lighter malty backing that it has. But overall, I can't really complain.
M - The carbonation is perfect. Light, delicate bubbles. I love the way that you can feel the intense hops on your tongue too.
O - Overall, it's not my favorite IPA out there, but it is one that I come back to often, because there is really nothing else out there like it (that I have found). Definitely for the hop lover. 1,222 characterscnbrown313, Jun 28, 2012

Theres a malty backbone to everything that is almost washed away on the back end by pine hops that leave a sticky feeling behind on the tongue.

4.47/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A: Pours a crystal clear golden orange in color with some light to moderate amounts of visible carbonation and very light amounts of particles in suspension. The beer has a finger tall dense creamy light beige head that has very good retention properties - the head eventually reduces to . Moderate to significant lacing is observed.
S: Moderate to strong aromas of hops - citrus/grapefruit, tropical/mango, floral, and pine.
T: There is a light presence of caramel malts that comes out upfront as well as in the finish but the flavor of this beer is dominated by the hops. There is a very nice balance between the hops flavors and they complement each other nicely - tropical/mango, citrus/grapefruit, and much lighter notes of pine/resin. No alcohol is detected and there is only a light to moderate amount of bitterness which lingers.
M: Medium bodied with moderate amounts of carbonation. Smooth and very creamy.
O: This is an extremely enjoyable DIPA and probably has the best mouthfeel of all the DIPAs I have tried. There is a nice blend of hop aromas and flavors without being overly bitter or aggressive. I really wish this was distributed to my area so I could find it more easily (picked this up while in Louisville for a wedding). 1,246 charactersdbrauneis, Jun 24, 2012

A: Lovely sunset gold with the slightest of chill hazes but good clarity overall...lots of fluffy lightly-off-white head and really good lacing.
S: Citrus bitterness upfront with orange, hint of grapefruit, mango, some tropical fruits, herbal hop oil and hemp seed, lightly piney hops...almost no malt or alcohol detected, but it maintains a definite sweetness from the caramel malt as well as the sweeter fruity hops.
T: Hops dominate again, with moderate underlying bitterness from front to back...orange and orange peel, mango, peach, floral and herbal, with a faint bready quality and a moderate hop dryness on the finish.
MF: Relatively medium feel with some creamy tones...light carbonation lets the hops dominate with a clingy, lasting dryness.
O: This is a good beer to me, definitely worth seeking out, but it isn't perfect in my opinion. I want beers like this to explode with hops, and while the hops were here I would have been just fine with more.

4.47/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5For a long time, this was my absolute favorite beer. While it is much better on tap at the brew pub, I am reviewing it from the bottle. 
Poured from the bottle into a snifter, the DIPA was a copper orange color with a generous white head. Upon close inspection, it showed a very respectable level of lacing. Dreadnaught might be the most intense hop aroma you can find in a beer. Pine and grapefruit notes are among those you are likely to discover. A tongue-bruising rush of hops is apparent on the first taste. Strong grapefruit, pineapple, and peach notes are detectable. These notes are centered on a biscuity backbone that allows the flavor action to lay on the tongue. In the aftertaste, a warming sensation is noted. The pineapple notes become sweeter in the aftertaste while the grapefruit notes run steady. The taste linger in the mouth nicely. 854 charactersJohnnyHopps, Jun 18, 2012

4.22/5  rDev -3.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5A top notch, well crafted DIPA. Perhaps less extreme than I expected; it’s actually quite drinkable for its ABV and lets the detailed flavors of the hops shine without overpowering bitterness. Hazy dark orange with a modest white head that settles down fairly quickly. Nice lacing remains on the glass. Aroma is quite hoppy, with a host of tropical and citrus flavors – orange, tangerine, mango, lemon – but also has an underlying caramel malt aspect.
The flavor is very much in line with the nose; lots of tropical and citrus notes from the hops, all quite vivid, with an underlying moderately sweet caramel malt flavor. Medium full bodied with medium to slightly low carbonation; mouthfeel is smooth and a little creamy. Finishes semi-dry but some fruitiness lingers on, as does a pleasant bitterness.
Overall I found this to be quite a good example of the style but not necessarily a hugely exceptional one. This field is growing crowded quickly and I felt this fell just short of the very top tier where the Headys, Plinys, and Double Sunshines live. No shame in that. 1,080 characterstobelerone, Jun 14, 2012

Crazy complexity in the color. It looks like there's a tornado in my pint glass. No BS. Wild. Must be coming from the sediment, which in my book is a plus. Preliminary lacing is good. Can't find anything wrong.
S: Punch of hoppy citrus aroma. Grapefruit. Tangerines. To me, the smell is lacking a bit. There's some sweet malt smell here too. But, I think the aroma I got with Zombie Dust was better. So, this doesn't quite meet my expectations even though it's good.
T: When it hits the mouth you taste what's like a sweet malty citrus/peachy soda. There's almost like a candied sweetness here. Candied fruits -- tropical fruits. The finish is like an earthy bitterness. There's a lot to like here. I'm just not sure there's a lot to love. Off the bat I can think of other IPAs that I think taste better, including probably Pliny the Elder. This is good, though.
M: A medium body, wonderfully carbonated, smooth and creamy feeling brew. This, I think is where FFF excels -- is the feel of their beer. They really nail it when it comes to their ales. There some chewiness here, when brings out the hops, which I like a lot. 
O: Even though I was a bit disappointed in the flavor, which might have something to do with expectations, this is a really good DIPA. It's not the best, but it's another solid showing by FFF. If you can find/try/buy this beer, then do it. But, if I had the choice I'd probably choose another FFF as my favorite. 1,553 charactersC20Percent, Jun 09, 2012

DN pours a medium orange color, with a generous amount of snow-colored head. Snow caps retain pretty well on this pour; cloudy, but can see through it. Nice aroma on this, especially as it warms a bit. To me, the smell is comprised of sweet malts & a bit of tropical fruit. This has one of my favorite tastes for a DIPA: pretty complex variety of tropical/summer fruits (peachy/apricot/mango types). The mouthfeel is appropriate for the style: on the heavy side of medium. There is a nice, dry, bitter finish. 
The first time I had this, it really blew me away. It's been a while since I had a fresh pour of this. My palate has matured a bit, but it still stands tall to me. One of my favorite complex, well balanced DIPAs. 751 charactersChiPool, Jun 04, 2012

M: High carbonation, body is average but works perfectly to allow focus to be on the aroma and taste.

A big thanks to tsauce2 for sending this over in a trade.
A: Pours a slightly hazy light golden amber with 1.5 fingers width of sea foam white head, dissipates down fairly slowly, leaves a fair amount of lacing.  
S: Great citrusy hop aromas including pineapple, grapefruit, mango, and apricot.  Some caramel malt sweetness, a hint of pine.  Awesome.  
T: The initial sip bring the citrusy goodness that was on the nose, with a significant sweetness on the finish.   There are flavors of orange, grapefruit and pineapple.   The sweetness is caramel and sweet bread malts.  Piney bitterness is noted as well, to add to the great balance.  The hop presence is huge but remains in check with equally big complimentary malt backbone.  Really, really tasty.  
M/D: Medium body, appropriate carbonation, big drying finish, ABV is very well masked and drinkability is exceptional.  
O: No doubt that this is a fantastic example of one of my favorite styles.  This is one of the best double IPAs I've had, although I think the top notch remains with Hopslam followed by HT.  Still, fantastic in its own right, and definitely worth seeking out.  I look forward to drinking this again in the future.   1,308 characterszac16125, May 26, 2012

Short review. I've had this one a number of times, and shocked that I hadn't reviewed it before.

Ok, ok, I can't get away with such an abbreviated writeup on such a marvelous beer; it definitely wouldn't do the dudes at FFF who brew this masterpiece justice.. So here I go with a review of this DIPA that some find perfect, while others throw rocks at, which I have no clue why.
Back in my craft beer adolescence, I had this beer a time or two and it was very good then. But obviously, my palate has evolved. Now I find this beer the beer that defines Three Floyds as the craft beer mega star.
Nick Floyd, this is one remarkable brew !! Keep up the great work.
Appearance -- this is one majestic tonic, sitting pretty in my duvel tulip after a so-so aggressive pour.
Smell -- to me, this beer blows Zombie Dust out of the water. Zombie Dust smells like Gumballhead on steroids, while Dreadnaught smells heavenly with a smell all its own. If Dreadnaught was bottled in six packs (hey, Nick Floyd are your listening?) this beer would out-sell Zombie Dust 2-to-1.
Taste -- all I can say is Dreadnaught is pairing very well with my salad with Caesar dressing. It's biting through the bitterness of the salad dressing but not overpowing in the least.
Mouthfeel -- oh darn, is that my pizza in the oven? Might be a bit on the done side, I forgot about time; enjoying the beer to the tilt. Mouthfeel, well, it's unlike any other hopped up brew I've had the pleasure of pouring into my duvel tulip. If I could score this beer 6s, I would.
Overall -- Did I say this beer gets better as it warms to room temperature? Oh well, I just did. Three Floyds makes some outstanding beers. I'd say this is the best of the best. Stock up whenever you get the chance to visit the craft beer mecca known as Three Floyds Brewing. 1,763 characterscadizkyguy, May 17, 2012

One finger of foam sits atop this beauty that is a fuzzy peach appearance. One can almost detect hop particles floating around in this bad boy.
The malt wallops the nose along with a smack of booze. This is one serious brew. Smells like a sipper. A definite arsonal of hops are hiding in ambush behind the malt.
Taste confirms the nose. A heavy syrupy sweet IIPA that packs an alcohol bite and then the hop assault hits like a blitzkrieg. A full on resin rush. Long bitter finish that begs for the next sip (after some time). One cannot rush this beer.
Mouthfeel is heavy and chewy, syrupy with great carbonation for an imperial india pale ale. Above average for this style.
A world-class IIPA, this has set the standard for a long time and is every bit as good as those west coast brews! Founders is right up there in the realm of midwest hoppiness. Two Brothers Hop Juice deserves a mention along with Half Acre Double Daisy. I forgot Pipeworks Ninja vs Unicorn. Dark Horse Double Crooked Tree....hmmm. In a nod to the west coast that Double Jack is in a tie for my favorite. Myrcenary nails the Mountain trophy. East coast award goes to Southern Tier DIPAS!! Where does it end? A quest for the best...stay tuned. 1,254 characters312HopBomb, May 16, 2012

A- Poured a clear medium orange color with visible carbonation. Three finger soapy head with some big bubbles that left some chunky lace
S- Big sweet pineapple, peach, mango, pine, and caramel malt aroma. Very sweet, hoppy, and aromatic.
T- Big sweet peach, pineapple, mango, and orange citrus hop flavors. A pretty big caramel backbone on this beer as well. Overall this is a very sweet DIPA and a moderate amount of bitterness for the style to make a more balanced DIPA. Some nice astringency on the finish.
M- Smooth, pretty soft mouthfeel, medium body, prickly carbonation, finishes dry
O- This beer has a lot of tropical hop flavor, but also is very well balanced with the caramel malt backbone. This is a very solid DIPA and very drinkable. At $12 a bomber this is probably the most expensive bottle per ounce I have bought so I don't see myself getting this often but it is very good. 938 charactersHoptometrist, May 16, 2012

Clear orange, with a white head. Good lacing and moderate retention. Lots of of peach and mango on the nose, a sugary vanilla-like malt with a generous amount of complexity between the hops and malt. Quite a bit more mango, tropical fruits and harsher citrus in the finish on the palate. A sugary cookie-dough like malt with a substantially bitter finish.

Appearance - Poured 3 fingers of golden eggshell creamy foam, color is a hazy gold with orange highlites. Nice foamy lacing is left after each sip.
Smell - WOW! Citrus, peach, apricot, mango, grapefruit, vanilla carmels, floral pollen, just smells fantastic!
Taste - The first sip is overwhelmed by my mouth watering at the bright, ripe citrus and orange colored fruits exploding across my palate! There is such a harmonius balance here - citrus of lemons, orange, ripe yellow and ruby grapefruit meats, peach, mango, papaya, and dried apricots. There is a wonderful sweet backbone of vanilla carmels going on here, vanilla is prevalent in the nose during the sip. The finish is a slight transition from all the ripe tropical and citrus fruits to the peels of all of these fruits, along with lush floral and meadowy hops to a slightly dry and piney pucker way at the back of the tongue - I love this, such great flavors going on here, bright luch and robust. 
Mouthfeel - Starts medium and juicy, but not thick or syrupy at all. A nearly medium carb then foams across the tongue, somewhat cleansing, but still leaving some of the carmel and fruity sweetness to linger - as the mouth begins to dry with fruit and citrus peels, and finishing with the drying and puckering hop flavors - begging you to take the next sip and quench the light dryness.
Overall - There are no flaws here whatsoever, and the alcohol is completely hidden. A wonderful DIPA, and one which I will gladly purchase again and again. A robust, complex, and flavorful beer, and an excellent representative of the style. 1,625 charactersblackcompg, May 13, 2012

Ap: Hazy orange with one finger white head.
Ar: Pungent tropical fruits, dominated by grapefruit. Some floral notes in the nose. 
Ts: Some biscuity malts give this a backbone, but the focus here is on the massive hop bitterness on the front of the palate. Some sweetness from the the tropical fruity hops.
Mo: Very drinkable for a massive DIPA. Pretty smooth and expected heaviness for the style.
Ov: Truly a great double IPA and one of the best I've had. I could return to this over and over again, too bad I'll be limited to when I can drive nine hours to the brewery. 617 charactersspark3148857, May 07, 2012

Overall: This beer is very well put together. I got it as an extra, and i have the irking it's a little past it's prime. Still, it is a fantastic IIPA but I'd love to try it fresh. 551 characterscradke, May 01, 2012

T - Big hops and bitterness. Green apple comes through as does the grapefruit and orange notes. Very nice sharp flavors. Can't really detect any malt.

Poured a perfectly clear golden/orange color with a 3 finger white head that stuck around for a bit.
Smell is excellent - definite citrus burst right off the start, followed by some piney resin scents and a bit of alcohol.
Taste follows smell, though I wish it had a bit more of a malty backbone to balance it out more. Regardless, still delicious.
Mouthfeel was spot on for this style.
Overall a solid DIPA....I have been drinking a lot of Heady Topper and Nugget Nectar lately, which are a bit better than this offering, but still, a solid DIPA that I will seek out again. 632 charactersTWStandley, Apr 12, 2012

S: Mango, grapefruit, pine, orange peel amybe? 
T: Amazing. One of the best tasting DIPAs I have ever had. Extremely well balanced and I can't even taste the alcohol at all. Mango, citrus, grapefruit, malty sweetness kicking in in the middle, it surprisingly does not finish bitter, although the lingering after taste is there (typical of this style). 
M: It was a bit more carbonated that I would have liked, but it makes this beer more refreshing and easier to drink. Lighter body than most DIPAs. 
O: I absolutely loved this beer. I wish I can get this all-year around (around me that is). I would not mind trading for another bottle or two during summer time. It's the most refreshing DIPAs I have ever had. 836 characterssukwonee, Apr 10, 2012
4.55/5  rDev +3.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Hm Dreadnaught. Bright amber body with a nice steady stream of carbonation coming from the bottom of my glass. Thick frothy almost pasty offwhite head floating.
I get a ton of alpha acids and hop extract oils in the smell. Sticky sweet lemon oil and orange zest. Powdery malts in the background.
Now that is one thick beer. And sweet. Might be the sweetest DIPA ive had. Oranges and mangoes from the hops, and a nice sweet backbone. Everything in this beer is dont to accent the hops. It feels so damn citric and juicy, like biting into an orange from a commerical that just squirts sweet orange juice everywhere, filling your mouth with sweet orange and lemon juices. 
After the initial hop flavors subside, the bitterness comes in only to balance things out. I can see why this thing is only second really to Hopslam. Hopslam is more sticky with its malt while Dreadnaught has more a powdery feel. 902 charactersVncentLIFE, Apr 10, 2012

T: All of wonderful things that the smell promised are certainly delivered in the taste. Extremely citrusy and hoppy flavors comoe through which prove to be much stronger and flavorful compared to many other IPAs and DIPAs out there.

A - Pours a clear light amber color with a great two finger pillowy head that lasts at one finger for the duration. Leaves a great tiered lacing down the glass. 
S - Wow! Incredibly citrusy with grapefruit, tangerine and tropicals. The hops are very noticeable as well and I would classify them as floral and piney. Very tropical with a great hop balance. Smells like fresh fruit.
T - Starts off a bit sweet with a citrus and peach fruitiness. The floral hops come in a bit later and offer a nice drying finish. The aftertaste is a combination of all of this with an added tea-like herbal character. Perfectly balanced and highly complex.
M - Good medium feel with a light carbonation. This is probably the weakpoint of the beer, but by no means unpleasant. I could use a bit more carbonation, but it is smooth and creamy as is. 
O - I was excited to see this at a store during a recent trip to South Bend, IN. No bottle dating always makes me a bit weary to pick up an IPA, but I pulled the trigger on this gem. It is incredibly balanced and tropical, with the perfect hop presence. Truly one of the best DIPAs I have had, and I wish I had grabbed more. The 9.50% alcohol is very well hidden and before I knew it, the whole bomber was gone. I highly recommend this beer and it is worth the gamble on freshness. 1,427 charactersNoLeafClover44, Mar 29, 2012

Appearance; pours a lovely hazy golden orange color with two fingers of loose off white colored head... Retention is decent, with a fairly thick film clinging to the top of the beer after a few minutes.. Lacing is solid with nice healthy clumps of lace clinging to the glass.
Smell; very subdued unfortunately, was hoping for a much more present aroma, unfortunately no bottle date to be found so i'm uncertain when this was bottled... An intense whiff yields pineapple, mango and some citrus.. A slight bready/yeasty aroma is also noticeable.
Taste; resinous notes are my initial impression, with pine being a primary component... Pineapple, mango orange and peach make a brief appearance... 
Mouthfeel; effervescent carbonation makes Dreadnaught feel lively in the mouth with a crisp finish and a slightly lingering bitterness...
Overall; I may have sat on this bottle a touch too long... Was originally waiting for a friend and finally said to hell with it and opened it up... I enjoyed this but definitely feel like a more fresh sample would have a lot more going on.. Would love to try another for comparison but at the moment I am unfortunately, a little underwhelmed... 1,258 charactersThingus, Mar 19, 2012

A: Awesome full bodied pour, deep orange and burnt gold color with a nice tight white 1.5-2 finger head. A steady stream of light carb coming from the bottom of the glass.
S: Hop-heaven. HUGE hop profile with citra overtones, pine, grapefruit, and almost a grainy-earth like smell to it. Fantastic huge IPA smell. It's like a classier more complex hop profile than the APW.
T: Hop-pallate destroyer. All I can taste is the hops at first while after the initial shock tones out the beer becomes complex and very smooth. The hops and the citrus (more grapefruit than anything) are complimenting each other so well, and there is definitely a slight boozy bite way back in the palate. Some malty sweetness- almost caramel or cane sugar-like. I'm sold on this beer, everything I've been looking for in a IPA.
M: Medium bodied beer that finishes a tad dry but not bitter by any means. I could drink this beer all damn day long (hopefully).
O: Right up there with ZD this is my favorite FFF brew, and one heck of an IPA- definitely a must try for any hop-head. 1,201 charactersDanK4, Mar 18, 2012

Aroma is tropical fruit. Mango, pineapple, and bright citrus is apparent. Flavor is grapefruit, tropical fruit, peach, and a nice caramel malt balance. It goes down really easy and the 9.5% abv is practically invisible. The mouthfeel is medium and the flavor lingers on the tongue. This is the standard I judge DIPA’s by. 431 charactersthydarkprevails, Mar 09, 2012
4.1/5  rDev -6.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Bomber with thanks to readbaron. Reviewed from notes.
Deep and clear orange to mahogany with a very large tight white head and fine lacing.
Sweaty cat piss, candied tangerine and tonnes of overripe tropical fruits just fallen off the tree.
Kiwi fruit, rotting jungle leaves, overripe mango and pineapple, juicy orange and resious pine. Malts are a bit player.
Chewy mouthfeel accentuated by mild carbonation. Moderate bitterness with satisfying length.
Lush tropical melange. Dank, wet, vegetal and jungle-esque. A well done and moreish DIPA. 547 charactersspicelab, Mar 09, 2012
4.25/5  rDev -3.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Huge thanks to Billakowski for the reviewable bottle.
Appearance: Nice bright orange with a slight haze. Head is super white and rocky. Notches of lacing cling to the glass. Head drops to a thin cap but never disappears.
Smell: Mango, pine, and citrus. Huge nose of hops. Malts are big enough to hold their own. Caramel malt sweetness more than asserts itself. Powdery. Pine and oily hops. So very juicy.
Taste: Hops and more hops. Mango and pine bring up the front, paving the way for a massive caramel malt sweetness. Slightly bready with a lingering finish. Some hints of alcohol on the back. Lingering bitterness is quickly washed away by juicy orange and grapefruit flavors. 
Mouthfeel: Light carbonation and a smooth, almost creamy at times, mouthfeel. Body is nicely moderate and keeps the drinking smooth. Dry finish.
Overall: For something so aggressive, there's a ton of balance. Big malts and even bigger hops. Crazy drinkable even with the ABV. In the long run, this is beer is greater than its parts. It's truly something special. 1,048 charactersGoblinmunkey7, Mar 07, 2012

4.03/5  rDev -8.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4From notes:
Served in a half pint glass at the brewery.
One finger of white frothy head, hazy pale to golden body. Good lacing and ok retention.
Smell of citrus, light pine and tropical fruit. Not as big as hoped but good.
Tastes of big citrus and piney hops. Some sweetness mid palate mixed with some earthy hops. Very firm bitterness and powdery dry finish. Alcohol is slightly noticeable but dosent detract in any way.
Medium thin bodied and medium carbonation keep it fairly drinkable. The bitter dry finish fits the style but not my likes.
Overall this is tasty and good but not great. I could only take one serving of this at a time. The smell and tastes are great but I'd like a bit more in the nose and a bit more body and sweetness. This has the FFF hop profile like most of their beers. 800 charactersHomebrew35, Feb 27, 2012

A- Light Amber in color, beautiful 1-1/2" head that seemed to last forever. Slight lacing
S- Hops hit you right away, plenty of citrus, maybe a touch of peach and pine as well. 
T- Smooth with a perfect hop balance. The citrus and and Pine are strong but not overpowering, slight caramel at finish.
M- Really drinkable for such a high alcohol brew, Carbonation was excellent. 
O- Wow, don't know how I have missed this beer in the past. Almost right in my backyard. Don't know how many have had this and Pliny the Younger, but I'll take Dreadnaught anyday.

Smell is that of Three Floyds. Orange and hops from the go. Citrus aroma is fresh and anticipated.
Carbonation is evident for this well bodied IPA.
Lots of alcohol in this FFF brew, but you don't notice it due to the smoothness! And it is smooth!

This first smell I get is tropical fruits like mango and pineapple, then some citrus from grapefruit and a little piney aroma. The grapefruit comes through on the taste more that the mango/pineapple that I was getting so strong from the smell, the piney flavor is also there but a little subdued compared to the other flavors. There is also a nice sweetness that complements the bitterness. The mouthfeel is in the middle compared to others in the style not nothing really stands out, the carbonation is good. Overall this is a great beer I don't buy a lot of bottles of this for personal consumption but when on draft I do tend to get this a lot compared to other DIPA that Indiana has to offer. 811 charactersphisigben, Feb 16, 2012

A- Pours a nice dark orange-amber with a finger and a half worth of head that sticks around for awhile. 
S- All hops in the aroma. I get lots of citrusy fruits overall- orange, mango, peach. 
T- Starts off smooth with a nice hop bite. Hops are mostly of citrus with some slight pine notes. The finish is of a hint of caramel malts.
M- Light and easily drinkable for such a higher ABV. Nicely carbonated, hop bitterness is great.
Dreadnaught is an awesome Imperial IPA. After being able to walk into any decent bottle shop around me and buy this for years, its getting harder for me to find. Dreadnaught is one of my go-to’s if I’m looking for a big IIPA. 764 charactersvic21234, Feb 13, 2012

Appearance: Amber with a slightly cloudy appearance. 
Smell: Hop bomb with strong citrus aroma.
Taste & Mouthfeel: Tons of hops and a nice malty backend. Very deceiving alcohol content. Malty sweet finish that's lacking from my current DIPA fave: Heady Topper.
Overall: This doesn't knock Heady Topper of its crown for me but comes really close if not possibly even a tie. If I had the chance to try this again I would love to taste the two side by side to see which was king. 631 charactersFujii13, Feb 06, 2012

A: A golden orange body with 2 inches of fluffy white head. Outstanding retention and lacing. This DIPA looks sticky as hell from the way the slowly receding head is clinging to the sides.
S: Grapefruit and citrus hops all the way here. No messing around. This just smells like a hop bomb.
T: And it is. Whoa. Grapefruit/citrusy hops through and through. I might get a hint of the sticky pine hops on the back end, but this is incredibly citrusy. And delicious.
M: Slick, oily, and sticky with a well-balanced, yet bitter, aftertaste. I actually really love the mouthfeel of this.
O: Flat-out one of the best DIPA's I've had. Along with Hopslam, this sits right at the top of the mountain of midwest DIPA's. I wish we could get this beer all the time in Michigan, but it makes me thankful when I do end up with a bottle. I'll never turn this beer down.
Edit: I just reread my review of Hopslam from a few weeks ago. In terms of my favorite DIPA's, Dreadnaught is closer to Hopslam than I originally thought. Having to choose between the two is a very nice problem to have. 1,247 characterstravMI13, Feb 06, 2012

4.57/5  rDev +4.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured from Bomber (1 Pint 6oz) into a Stella Artois Chalice.
A- The color is a rich murky golden brown. Short lubberly head dissipated right away, a fine looking double IPA.
S- It smells strongly of mango with a hint of grapefruit and even a very tiny hint of pomegranate. The rich fruity overtones help mask the light scent of alcohol that is present. it smells very tropical and citriusy. 
T- The initial taste is very very sweet and reminiscent of a sweeter Old Ale. The first thing I thought upon tasting it was that this has been aged slightly? In a good way.The taste is of fresh tropical fruits like mango and papaya. For whatever reason it also reminds me of rhubarb cake.The sweetness lingers on your tongue for a second before spreading over a 2 second period into what I can only describe as a fire of citrus flavor. The transition leads it to finish with a tart grapefruity sting on the back of the tongue that burns slightly and leaves one wanting more. A herbal hoppy flavor is also present that melds nicely with the citrus tones. 
M- Initially it comes of smooth and mild. It then leads into a choppy feel before leaving a nice alcohol burn on the back of the tongue and down the throat. 
O- A very delicious double IPA. Not like some IIPA's that can be much too intense with hops. It's the perfect combination of sweet and tart hoppiness delight. One of my new favorite double IPA"s for sure. 1,415 charactersZachtheporter, Feb 02, 2012

Bottle to Westvletren 12 (small) chalice
Enjoyed as part of a tasting in Utrecht (December 2011) as a result of Jeffo and doopiedoopiedoo's generosity. Thanks guys...can't wait to return the favor!
A: Burnt tangerine. 2+ (foamy white) fingernail head on medium pour.
S: Earthy notes of pine and grass. Sweet malt and caramel along with citrus, lemon zest, pineapple core, and grapefruit.
T: Loads of tropical fruit balanced with pronounced bitter hop character. Nice balance and so very smooth to drink. My sample pour disappeared rather quickly as I can never get enough of this beer!
M: Medium-full bodied with medium carbonation.
O: A very good offering from a brewery that knows how to use hops (and lots of them) to make really tasty beers. So drinkable and so good - every time. I love it! The only thing better than enjoying it out of the bottle with a great group of BA's is to enjoy it on-draft in Munster. 934 charactersspdyfire83, Jan 31, 2012

A- Pours a deep orange. Capped with a finger and a half of gorgeous, ivory white head with a creamy, sticky-as-hell texture. Leaves excellent lacing.
S- Big west coast hop aroma, lots of citrus and pine with some tropical fruit sweetness as well. Smells very bright and refreshing.
T- Same as the nose only much more powerful. Big wallop of pine resin and oily bitterness up front, towards the center it settles into fruity, sweet flavors of mango and citrus before finally finishing with a long-lasting, dry bitterness with a touch of sweetness. Malt bill does pretty well here. Booze flavor is kept to a minimum but becomes pretty warm as the beer comes closer to room temperature.
M- Medium to full bodied, smooth oily feel with moderate to low carbonation. Really leaves some serious bitterness on the palate.
O- An delicious DIPA, one of my favorite giant-towering-hops beers. 990 charactersWillCarrera, Jan 30, 2012

another beer that I've seen the rating for before rating so I'll try and not be biased.
A & S: the smell is a very nice blend of resiny/piney (probably Chinook hops) and citrus hops. There is also some kind of fruitiness. Lively looking semi-transparent amber colored beer. Off-white fluffy head that pours about a finger and is retained in a layer for the rest of the beer. 
T & M: very similar to the smell. There is a nice addition of a slight sweet maltyness to make the backbone pretty noticeable. alcohol is more present when its let warm. fairly bitter and a semi-dry finish. very well balanced but it's not super complex. very smooth with still a bite of carbonation (thought I was going to be more because the beer looks so lively). Heavy on the high side for body.
O: This beer is incredibly solid, and deserves its high rank among the best of the best. It's deffinatly in my top 10 if not five and I would recommend this beer to any one. 989 charactersminterro, Jan 30, 2012

A very nice copper color with nice thick head.
Smell
Citrus and hop aromas jump out at once.
Taste
A hop fans dream come true. Very flavorful with huge notes of citrus and full hop flavors expected from a DIPA. There is a great balance of hop and caramel malt. Three Floyds does an outstanding job in creating one of the best tasting DIPA's in the market.
There is a warm presence of alcohol but nothing overbearing despite this beer being 9.0 +.
Overall
This is an outstanding beer that is in the same class as the Pliny IPA's. 547 charactersterrapinmark, Jan 30, 2012

Appearance - Golden copper tan/brown, nice 1 nch creamy head and decent lacing.
Smell - Strong, intense hops, very piney along with orange, grapefruit, added hop oils, apple, mango and a malty backbone mixed in there. 
Taste - Excited, getting ready to drink one of my wants listed beers. At first sip, major hop bomb with a mix of malts. Pine, orange and honey with a presense of alcohol in each drink. After hops hit you at first, malts come in at the finsh and balance out the bitterness of hops.
Mouthfeel - Tounge gets blasted and hop numbed at first sip. Tounge is left sweetned, numbed and dried. Palette gets hops, malts at the end and plenty of fruit sweetness. Aftertaste is warm, fruity and really dry.
Overall - Love hops? This is a must try. Its alot more fruity and not as bitter as i was expecting. Amazing use of multiple styles of hops, great amount of malts, and enough alcohol to let you know this is a big, complex beer. World class for sure. 994 characterswvsabbath, Jan 27, 2012

This imperial IPA is highly sought after by beer geeks and is universally hailed as one of America's top beer by most beer connoisseurs. I am lucky enough, living in both Wisconsin and Illinois, to be within Three Floyds' distribution network, so Dreadnaught is an off the shelf gem that I have regular and convenient access too.
Score: 95
10 oz tap pour from a two week old keg at Brickhouse BBQ, served in a globe-like glass and enjoyed 01/24/12. Sadly, the KBS tap ran dry 10 mins before I arrived for dinner -- less than 24 hours after tipping the BA universe about the special tapping.
Appearance: Pours a clear orange color served with a thin layer of slightly off-white head that settles into a thin ring around the glass. Amazing lacing -- large sheets of frothy white head stick like crazy to all sides of the glass. 5/5
Smell. Sweet pine sap and sharp grapefruit and tropical hops mixed with light notes of sweet malt in the back. Astringent hoppiness. 4/5
Taste: Absolute hopbomb! Flavor is a sharp blast of tropical citrus hoppiness -- lots of astringent/zesty orange, pine, grapefruit, pineapple and mango -- followed by a lingering piney bitterness (that is much more mild compared to the upfront explosion of bitter flavor) for the finish. A light, sweet caramel backbone balances out the hoppiness a touch. The flavor experience of this beer reminds me of the Top Thrill Dragster at Cedar Point in Sandusky, Ohio. It shoots you out of the gate with citrus hoppiness, rocketing from 0-120 miles per hour in mere seconds, shoots you up some 400 feet, and then sends you plummeting back down to earth with some lingering adrenaline (here, the mild piney bitterness). The flavors, like the Top Thrill Dragster, are not very complex, but the whole experience is nonetheless incredibly delicious. 4.5/5
Mouthfeel: Near perfect imperial IPA mouthfeel. Medium bodied, medium-plus carbonation. Very oily, slight mouthwatering mouthfeel. Finish is bitter. 4.5/5
Overall: Enjoy this one fresh, and boy will you enjoy it.
Recommendation: Hops haters and casual beer drinkers should avoid this aggressive imperial IPA, but boy should hop heads seek this one out.
Pairings: The beef chili, with a little added hot sauce, at the Brickhouse BBQ.
Cost: $11.99 for a 22 oz (bomber) bottle or $6.50 for a 10 oz pour. 2,420 charactersjegross2, Jan 25, 2012

Poured from a 22 oz. capped bottle (no date) into a snifter glass.
A vigorous pour yields a 1 1/2-finger off-white head that slowly recedes to a thick, clumpy dusting and thick foam ring. The body is a orange amber with a good amount of rising carbonation bubbles. Thick lacing can be seen clinging to almost every available portion of glass.
Orange, pineapple, mango, and peach all hit the nostrils at once. Digging a little deeper reveals some pine lingering in the background along with just a hint of bready malts.
Flavors of orange rinds, peach, and mango are all present at first sip. Also noticeable is notes of pine, honey, and biscuity malts. Upon swallowing the beer, piney bitterness surges throughout the entire mouth. However, this is quickly swept away by sweet flavors of pineapple and honey. An ever so slight piney bitterness persists between sips.
Medium bodied with excellent carbonation, this beer has an amazingly clean finish for such a flavorful DIPA. The body is just a bit sticky and really does a good job at coating your mouth and properly depositing the flavors. The carbonation is a bit fizzy but definitely needs this kind of strength to keep the body drinkable. 1,248 charactersoutput01x, Jan 25, 2012

4.3/5  rDev -2.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5A – Transparent golden orange with little –to-no head. A light, white lacing line appears on this DIPA.
S – Pine, peaches, grapefruit… Hop oil, smells sweet, yet bitter.
T – Big on the hops, but still well balanced. The malts provide a much needed sweet tone that helps the hops not overpower the flavor. There is a light fruitiness that is the shinning though nicely, a bit of apricot? Grainy, citrus bite, but still likeably sweet.
M – Light carbonation and a creamy texture. Very pleasant for a big DIPA… speaking of which, the alcohol is warming, but still well hidden (and is also a bit of a creeper).
O – Very well balanced for being so hoppy. I cannot believe it took me so long to try this brew. 723 charactersZombiesAteMyDog, Jan 25, 2012

Smell was less than I had expected from such a highly rated beer. It had pine, citrus, hops and lots of pungent malts, but had a sort of "wet dog" smell that I found a bit odd.
Taste is boldly hoppy, plenty of pungent malts, grapefruit and pine, citrus peel bitterness on the follow through.
Body is really nice, full and creamy, with a touch of sweet, aftertaste isn't as bitter as I would have thought. Nice.
It's certainly a worthwhile beer for any hophead. I will definitely leave this on my wants list. 585 charactersAlCaponeJunior, Jan 11, 2012

4.15/5  rDev -5.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4poured into tulip glass.
Appearance: A brilliant and clear yellow bodied beer with a massive bone white head. Easily 4 fingers of thick dense head from a moderate pour. As the head receeds, it leaves really thick lacing and the head is really chunky foam with many small bubbles. The head never seems to die or maybe i am just drinking this beer that fast! This is a sexy looking beer!
Smell: This beers hops profile is quite nice! You get a little bit of the malts is the nose as a faint bready and biscuity smell. The hops smell very diverse tropical, citrus, floral and earthy. Pineapple and mangos; Oranges and lemon; piney and grassy. Smells great!
Taste: This beer is hop forward. The beer has a big malt profile, but it does balance out the huge hops present. A little unbalanced, but its a minor thing with this beer. The hops are at the high end of moderately bitter. Prominent hops flavors of pine, grapefruit, grass, and pineapple. 
Mouthfeel: This beer is a medium bodied beer with moderate carbonation. It finishes clean with a mild amount of bitterness that really lingers for a while. 
Overall: This beer is a fantastic beer made by 3F. Its a great DIPA. My only request is put a freshness date on this beer 3F! Paired this beer with wisconsin sharp cheddar. Yum! The cheese bring out the malts and creaminess of this beer. Always a great pair together!!!! 1,376 characters4DAloveofSTOUT, Jan 11, 2012

Dreadnaught pours a beautiful orange/yellow in color with a nice one finger white head. Massive sheets of lacing on my snifter glass. This brew is fairly clear, and easy to see the good carbonation rising from the deep. Holy Crap. Great nose on this one! I could smell it the second the cap came off. Lemon, pine, grapefruit, hops, pineapple... Really amazingly good, balanced citrus nose on this one. I can't think of anything to improve. Woah. The taste is amazing. This is a hophead's dream beer, and thus, I love it. Hops all the way around w/ the malt backbone holding it up, but out of the way. The hops are literally destroying my palate half-way through the bottle. Awesome. A small citrus flavor on the back end before the hops comes and destroys what's left of it. Feel is smooth on the front and end, and hop bite everywhere else. Great carbonation as well. Overall, this is definitely one of the best beers I've ever had in my life. If you have a chance to try it- RUN- and pick up as many as your arms will hold. Really glad I got a chance to try this beer. Cheers! 1,168 charactersjayhawk73, Jan 05, 2012

4.45/5  rDev +1.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5There isn't much more to add here, that others haven't mentioned.
I'll break format and just try to describe what is, if forced to choose, my favorite beer on earth.
Dreadnaught is the most perfectly intense IPA I've ever had. I've had the big California IPAs and loved every drop, but if all IPAs were equally available, this is what I'd pick.
Bitter, bitter, bitter. Pine needles, grapefruit, cat pee, and anger. This is heavy metal in a bottle. High alcohol content that really can't distract from the palette wrecking, mouth ruining bitterness. 
This beer is singularly responsible for me losing interest in standard IPAs, and desiring Imperials or Doubles. 
Another great thing is how you can really taste the FFF flavor concepts... There's a consistency from every FFF beer over 50 IBU... Something recognizably present in the hoppy overtones, that you will find in things like Alpha King, Zombie Dust, right up through Panzer and Dreadnaught.
It's so aromatic and impressive... If you ever have this beer and aren't knocked off your feet by the smells and the intense flavor, you either have an old bottle, or are getting something from a bad tap. This is my desert island beer. 1,191 charactersTapeDeck, Dec 24, 2011

I really felt lucky to be finally able to try this beer. Cheers Jeff/Erik for this opportunity.
A - A nice clear orange/yellow fluid with a white head.
S - Pine, green, citrus smell. Slight malt hints. Mostly hops though. Delicious and well-balanced.
T - A little sweetness, but mostly it's the hop flavors that are noticeable. The hop presence is very nice though.
M - Medium carbonation, crisp but sweet finish.
O - A very good DIPA 599 charactersMar02x, Dec 23, 2011

4.33/5  rDev -1.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 22oz bottle into a tulip.
A nice orange, light amber pour with remarkable clarity. A 1/2 of off white head develops and diminishes slightly but leaves some wonderful lacing.
Super tropically nose. Pretty sweet, notes of pineapple and mango. For being a big hoppy DIPA, the hops aren't as punchy as I was expecting.
Wow. I wasn't expecting the taste to follow the nose with so much tropical fruit. Really sweet mango is the first thing to hit. There's plenty of bitterness (it does say 99 IBUs after all). The finish leaves me with a little note of coconut and then a slight alcohol warmth.
A pretty full mouthfeel with a surprisingly creamy finish. My tongue is tingling, largely from the bitter hops but I think the carbonation plays a role in this as well.
Overall, a fantastic DIPA. I've had a wide variety of DIPAs and this is one of the most complex, flavorful versions I've had before. A real treat. If only they distributed to MN! 956 charactersqthompso, Dec 20, 2011

Pours a hazy golden amber color with one finger off-white head.
Piney, green, citrusy nose. Slight malt hints. Mostly hops though. Delicious and well-balanced.
Taste is sweet and hoppy, giving off notes of mango, pineapple, and apple. Light sweet taste with a clean slightly bitter finish
Moderate carbonation with well-rounded, crisp but sweet finish.
Overall a stellar example of an imperial IPA. No overwhelmingly hoppy but shows off serious amount so hops and malts while keeping them in balance to create an overall delicious beer. Will seek out again! 591 characterssyrupjoe, Dec 18, 2011

Pours hazy orange with a white head that dissipates quickly.
Smells of hops and citrus, very balanced, not as hoppy as i expected.
Taste has surprising hints of sweetness, but remains balanced. Flavors of hops, citrus, pine. 
Medium body, carbonation plays nicely, doesn't dry the mouth out like other DIPAs that I've had. 
Very well made, possibly my favorite DIPA. 398 charactersvrbulldog22, Dec 17, 2011

S: Big oily hops hit first, pure pines, with orange rind. Some lighter smell, papaya. Toasted bread. 
T: Whoa, sweet sweet hops hit me first. I get papaya as in the nose, and honeydew. Almost citrus, but none of the "tanginess" of the type. Lots of sweetness from the malts. Hops have an herbal taste on the backside, oily and bitter but don't cross into the piney resinous type. Gets better as it warms and blends nicely. Malts are dryer on the back as well, bread toast comes to mind. 
M: Nice solid medium body, a bit much on the carbonation. 
O: Just an overall good brew, the huge hop profile is unique in it's "almost citrus" profile. Well done. 790 characterschilly460, Dec 14, 2011

A- Orange with a one finger white head. the classic DIPA
S- Its not quite the Hoppy explosion that I got from the Arctic Panzer Wolf but its a much more balanced smell. Sweet malts, some grassyness, some citrus, strange banana and coconut notes.
T- Lots of hop bitterness but its a balanced DIPA, Bitter hops up front an a smooth malty finish. Feels like a variety of hops, astringency, citrusy and piney. 
M- Leaves your mouth feeling fairly moist, follows up with a lot of hop bitterness. Goes down easy and has a good texture from the carbonation. 
O- Been looking forward to this one for a while, glad I finally got it. Its the almost perfect DIPA that hits high notes all across the board. 713 charactersTwelveOunces, Dec 09, 2011

A: Dense, cloudy yellow/gold; dense, fluffy, off-white 1"+ foam that settles exceptionally slowly and eventually leaves an almost solid, thin sheet of sticky lacing.
S: Sweet, rose-like floral; citrus, vanilla, banana; faint herbs; concentrated caramel; alcohol. 
T: Sweet, citric fruit, esp. grapefruit; tropical mango; caramel/toffee; very slow growing bitterness that remains at a low level; alcohol heat.
M: Creamy and rich, even a tad syrupy; low carbonation, medium-to-full body; neutral finish.
O: A big, balanced brew that is extremely complex; each taste brings new elements to mind; deceptively drinkable at 9.5% ABV. 733 charactersbierbrauer, Dec 06, 2011

4.38/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a clear, golden amber color with a large, light tan head developing initially before settling to a solid 1/2" that just lasts and lasts. Really good lacing.
Smell is piney with a note of lemon and a hint of vanilla. No balance to it but really didn't expect much.
Taste is better balanced with some malt showing up to counter, if only slightly, the hop-heavy aspect of this style. A citrus note with a strong alcohol presence rounds out the big evergreen hop note that is foremost from start to finish.
Full-bodied and light-ish effervescence with a slight astringency. Smoother than expected. While this is a style I don't normally seek out, this is an example worth searching for. I can't tell you how had it was to get this in Florida (thanks Mom & Glen). 764 charactersPorterLambic, Dec 04, 2011

4.3/5  rDev -2.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Beer is light amber with a small white head. Lots of lacing.
The most immediate smell is pine. Accompanied also by lots of citrus (grapefruit in particular) and caramel malt. Caramel is surprisingly strong, though by no means overtaking the very nice pine scents.
As for taste, beer is quite bitter, with lots of grapefruit, pine and soapy flavours. The caramel malt is prominent and provides a very nice background for the effects of the hops. More pine than citrus, but both are present. The bitterness is well-integrated, flavourful rather than simply bitter.
Strong carbonation, medium body.
Overall, very enjoyable. A really good beer. 644 charactersjrenihan, Dec 03, 2011

S-Damn thats fruity. Smells almost like smelling fruity pebbles. other than that, theres also the citrus aroma to it along with Pine
T/M-Delicious. at first there is a mix of fruity and citrus taste, different fruits are combined for one very dynamic flavor and the hops finish off the brew with a dryness not unlike a desert

Presentation-Label seems to have a crazed creepy circus group on it. Gotta love the skull with the wings. Maybe its just me since im a metal fan. 
Appearence-Pours a really nice cloudy orange peel. Hazy as well. Seems to have a lot of carbonation. Hold its head well. Got about a finger to a finger and half. Head looks nice and thick, an off white delight. Kind of want to eat it with a spoon. 
Smell-Im getting in between a pineapple, grapefruit and lime smell in this bad boy. Wish i didnt have a damn stuffed up nose, id be able to smell this better. Nice smell of glorious hops. Smell a little closer and small notes of sweetness follow through. 
Taste-At first this beer has a strong grapefruit mouth to it. Nice. I taset lemon-lime bit here and there. Also gettting some orange peel in there that when added with the hops serves up a nice bitterness. 
Mouthfeel-A good solid feel on this one. Nice carbonation. Enough to make it nice and crisp. Seems a bit dry and the finish is dry as well. I would like for it to linger. Somewhat of a heavy beer but its nice. 
Overall-I think this beer could be a little more. Maybe its my fault because i did let this one sit for a few weeks like an idiot. Its grapefruit presence make it a really nice quencher. Glad i have another one, good brew. 1,378 charactersales4baldo, Dec 02, 2011

A: This is a really gorgeous caramel amber color. Nice and hazy. Two fingers of white fluffy head. I haven't even started and I can already see some amazing lacing. The head has fantastic retention too. Beautiful and unbelievably inviting. Maybe if there was just a bit more head retention this would be a perfect 5.0
S: Definitely lots of fresh hop oils. Big piney aromas hit me first. Tons of citrus. From the bottle (before pouring) I got a lot more floral notes that are still present but not so much so. Now it's primarily pine and citrus. The malts have a nice presence here as well and it makes me think this is going to have a substantive backbone.
T: Nice slap in the face from the hops, but that was to be expected. Primarily taste a rich pineyness. That's immediately wrestled down by a perhaps overly sweet caramel malt. There's a huge change of pace from the big piney bitterness to this equally bit caramel malty sweetness. I do get the alcohol on the finish, but it's almost immediately taken over by a nice bitter finish. And oh is it long.
M: Light to medium body with good carbonation. No complaints here but nothing really jumps out.
O: Man, this beer took me a few sips to adjust to. It really swings for the fences. It's actually quite drinkable as I've realized I've finished most of the glass of 9.5% abv beer during the tasting itself! I really do enjoy this beer... I love, love huge hoppy DIPAs but I do feel like this beer is fighting with itself a bit. 1,571 characterstony223366, Nov 29, 2011

S: perfect mix of citrus and floral hops. My wife doesn't drink beer but she kept asking to smell this one. The malt is intermixed but the dominating aromas are all you care to acknowledge.
T: a nicely formulated interplay between sweet caramel with citrus nd piney hops. The alcohol content is well hidden. The hop character is complex and memorable.
M: creamy for an IPA. Moderate to high carbonation and medium bodied.
Overall: this is a very nice DIPA. Not perfect in the taste but very close. The aroma is impressive and te mouthfeel unique. 660 characterskylehay2004, Nov 27, 2011

4.95/5  rDev +12.8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Poured from a 22oz bomber I got from fellow BA Urbencaver who I must give a big shout out to into a chilled Duvel tulip glass.
A: Pours a light amber with an initial huge head that fades after a few minutes and leaves an awesome array of sticky lacing on the glass.
S: Just how I like my IPA's. Huge tropical notes of Mango and citrus with huge amount of hops balanced out with a semi-sweet malt background.
T: WOW, this beer is everything they say it is. It starts out with a bitter pine, tropical fruit taste and then the sweet malt background kicks in and all the flavors unite as one.
M: Very nice on the palate. Perfect amount of carbonation to this beer.
O: One of the best IPA's I have ever had. You wouldn't think the ABV was over 9% and you could get in trouble with this beer as it has a very easy drinking demeanor to it. Great IPA that I would highly recommend to the hophead 892 charactersFinatic, Nov 26, 2011
4/5  rDev -8.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Served chilled in a traditional pint glass.
Poured a light translucent amber that had a froathy slight off white head. The foam faded to a minute layer and even equally small inconsistent ring around the glass. The first smells are hoppy freshness, floral, slight pine, dish detergent and citrus. This is a hop-o-vore's delight. Very slight malt and a tang of bitterness. Great composition. The 9.5% abv is not obvious... this is a smooth, non-boozy, kick ass beer. 3F's best brews are their hoppiest, in my humblest of opinions. 
Enjoy! 539 charactersrmcnealy, Nov 26, 2011

Poured from the 22 oz. bomber that I bought at Save-On Tobacco & Beverage in Mentor, Ohio about a week ago for $10.99 into a clean, clear pint glass. 3F just started distributing to Ohio about a month ago and so I will be able to pick up a few here and there when I find them (the selections are sporadic according to two beer stores). I had a chance to try this at Chef Paul’s Bavarian Lodge in Lisle, IL about a year ago but I would have had to buy and drink the bottle at the restaurant and there were too many interesting beers on tap there to drink from a bottle. Anyway, I digress. No observed “best by” date.
A Slight haze hovers over a translucent honey yellow brown body under a moderately big head that dissipated over about 2 minutes into a single layer of bubbles on the top of the beer. Fine look for the style. I do like the light butterscotch candy look of the body. The more vigorous the pour, the thicker and bigger the head so you might want to be careful. The head sticks to the inside of the glass in a pleasing way as well. 4.0
S Hops hit me first but then this great, balanced malt presence follows closely behind. This beer smells big but great! 4.5
T Oh yes, I can immediately appreciate what all of the attention that this beer gets comes from! What a great balance of floral hops and caramel sweet malt! There is very little of the hops bitterness that I sometimes encounter in beers of this style. Instead is a great, lingering flowery hops that pleases well after the last sip. This is a very nicely crafted beer. 4.5
M Full and big like the smell suggested would be the case. The hops bitterness and the great big caramel sweet malt contribute to the huge feel but in this beer’s case big is beautiful because it is so well balanced. 4.5
D/O Drinkability is good for such a big beer with an elevated ABV% too. Overall this is a great beer. 4.5 1,898 charactersadamette, Nov 25, 2011

4.08/5  rDev -7.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Bottle served in a pint glass.
Appearance: Pours a pale yellow with a slight orange hue. A huge pillowy white head takes forever to dissipate.
Smell: piney hop aroma with a hint of grapefruit. The smell is actually a little faint. The bottle was fresh on the store shelves but who knows how long it was till it made it to the store.
Taste: A pleasant citrus hop flavor with a smooth clean bitterness that is well balanced by the sweet malt flavors in the background.
Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel is surprisingly smooth for such a big hoppy beer. A pleasant surprise.
Overall: An excellent imperial IPA. Excellent balance between sweet malt flavor and citrus hop bitterness. The dry mouthfeel and smooth finish is especially impressive. The only downside is the price of the large format bottles. 796 charactersagomega, Nov 24, 2011

4.92/5  rDev +12.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Poured from bomber bottle into belgian beer glass . 
Light copper hue that shows strong clarity with big time lacing. Big head that stands when you gently swirl the beer in the glass. 
Greeted by big pine, awesome flora smell with subtle citrus upon pouring. Like an elegant ipa on steroids the way it smells. 
Taste bites up front with hops, middle tastes of not too sweet caramel with big time malt, finishes with a nice hop bite that lingers on your tongue for a while. 
Mouthfeel is smooth, balanced carbonated. This beer goes down alot easier than its nearly 10% Abv suggests. 
I love it and wish it was on tap for my visit. A must for any Hophead. 658 charactersDurtdiggler, Nov 19, 2011

A: Fairly clear and somewhere between copper and straw. Nice white head that retains with average lacing.
S: Hops... Citrus & pine. Not much else, but also not as over the top as I had hoped for. Seemed more like the nose of an IPA.
T: Some sweet caramel in the body balancing out the bitterness and keeping it at bay. Once again, predominantly citrus (grapefruit) hop flavours with hints of pine resin. Again, the body screams of IPA too me. 
M: Some lingering bitterness, which is surprisingly low as I finished the bomber on my own and I was expecting to scrape my tongue clean after this. Average carbonation.
O: Not what I want in a DIPA. Seemed like a high ABV, well balanced IPA... I want mountains of hop flavours and tongue scraping bitterness. Maybe I have become immune to bitterness (lupelin threshold anyone?) or maybe it is that I get to make over the top bitter & hoppy beers myself, but this is not pleasing to me... It's OK, but not even close to a great DIPA. 1,091 characterskjyost, Nov 19, 2011
4.45/5  rDev +1.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured part of a bomber into a pint glass. This poured a clear gold amber with light amounts of yeast deposits within. A cream colored forthy head developed, retention was okay but not long. 
Smells of powerfully piney citrus, almost too powerful for me, but not unexpected. 
The taste was a sweet orange upfront, bitter grapefruit on back of pallete, and little or no alcohol taste or burn. 
The mouthfeel with light and crisp but some body was definitely there.
Definitely what I expected for a hoppy IIPA overall. 517 charactersPete0714, Nov 18, 2011
4.7/5  rDev +7.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Serving glass: Poured from bottle into Nonic Imperial Pint.
Appearance: Hazy honey-gold with moderate stark white head and nice lacing.
Smell: Mango, lemon and grapefruit. Very tropical. Some caramel malts underneath. Aroma is a mix of dry, sweet and tart.
Taste: Unbelievably fantastic balance of tropical hops (grapefruit, lemon, mango, peach, orange) and semi-sweet caramel and toasted malts. Slight weed-like characteristics. Finishes spicy and just somewhat bitter.
Feel: Quite simply, the smoothest and creamiest DIPA I have ever had. Moderately low carbonation enhances the smooth feel, but the dry, warming finish seals the deal.
Overall: One of the best DIPAs out there. 684 charactersbsp77, Nov 18, 2011

S: A lot gentler than I would expect from an American DIPA. Aromas of pine, orange, lemon, grapefruit, and mango are immediately noticeable. I guess I was expecting something more resinous and abrasive.
T: Starts off bitter and citrusy with navel orange, kumquat, lemon, grapefruit, and mango notes in abundance. Pine, spruce, caramel, mint, and biscuit flavors kick in around mid-palate. The finish is long, bitter, and a bit resinous with pine, caramel, citrus, and biscuit notes in a relatively even balance.
M: Medium to full bodied with gentle, yet insistent carbonation. Starts off fairly dry, but gets a little stickier by the finish. Very juicy and weighty, but still drinkable, and with no alcohol burn whatsoever. Unlike many ales of this style, Dreadnaught's balance is particularly commendable. Very polished.
O: This is easily one of the best DIPAs I've tried. Dreadnaught displays a wonderful balance of malt and hop flavors-it's not just a one-dimensional hop bomb. A truly exceptional beer, this is one not to miss. 1,146 charactersmrfrancis, Nov 15, 2011

Fluffy white head awesome lacing, rich copper color.
Nose is pine upfront, citrus in the end.
Flavor is what you expect from an IPA, lots of citrus notes, though none of the booze you might expect from a beer at this ABV. Quite quaffable. 324 charactersGhenna, Nov 09, 2011
4.23/5  rDev -3.6%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4A: Pours a golden-caramel color with 1.5 fingers of thick, white head. Great retention; leaves behind tons of lace. Gorgeous!
S: Rich, piney hops. Strong citrus, grapefruit, hints of mango. Smells fresh and delicious.
T: Big hop character up front with a strong malt backbone. Caramel sweetness blends with the citrus, bringing forth its own unique flavor profile. Hoppy bitterness as it descends, but it doesn't bite and leaves me wanting more.
M: The creamy and full mouthfeel really delivers here. All other IPAs should take note!
D: Drinkability is limited only by my inability to purchase FFF in Brooklyn. A top-notch DIPA overall. 640 charactersbrystmar, Nov 07, 2011
4.65/5  rDev +5.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Bought a 22 FL OZ bottle of this from Binny's Beverage Depot in Chicago, IL for $11.99. Poured from the trippy bottle w/ a what looks to be Nutcracker first look but really is a man from India in front of The Taj Mahal w/ two of his friends into my 0,47 l New Belgium Oversized Snifter Glass. Does not have a freshness date (duh!). 
Aroma- Has a very strong citrus aroma from the start. There is definitely a mango character that lingers with the burnt pretzel aroma I have been finding lately in fresh IPA's. Dank would be the perfect word to describe this!
Appearance- Pours a 2 finger head that has good retention. The head that is left has a strange, pond like residue as if moss or algae was growing on the surface! Very strange but cool! Has a deep orange colored body with quite a bit of haze. Leaves light lacing. 
Flavor- Has a huge strong hop flavor and tons of citrus. Not much grapefruit or piney attributes but more grassy/earthy that has double the flavor. Medium-high hop bitterness.
Mouthfeel- Medium-Full Bodied, Medium Carbonation, Smooth but then puckers the mouth and then stays around on the palate for ages! Very nice. Can't beat this mouthfeel.
Overall Impression- DANK! This is such a great 2X IPA! I wish this was available in St. Louis because this would be my go-to IPA. Of course everyone's had this, there are almost 1,500 reviews. I would now like to enjoy this fresh @ FFF BrewPub. Thanks again FFF for a great brew! 1,452 charactersDCon, Nov 05, 2011

A: Caramel colored and very opaque. Pour does not have lots of carb. and settles down with a light ring around the edge of the glass. Light to moderate lacing. (3.0)
S: Is this Devil Dancer? Hops Hops Hops on top of a caramel malt backbone. Pretty dank, not tropical like I expected. (4.0)
T: Not nearly as hoppy as the smell, perhaps this bottle isn't fresh. That said, it seems it may be at the "in-the-middle" stage. Hop character is still here, but the beer tastes equally malty. (3.5)
M: Light carbonation, medium to heavy bodied. (3.0)
O: I was expecting a more pronounced hop character. Instead this seems almost like an Arrogant Bastard type beer...just a huge brew that is equally malty & hoppy. (3.5)
EDIT: Well, it's around an hour later and this beer has had a chance to warm up. I guess I learned my lesson about reviewing a beer directly out of the fridge...so here we go again:
A: Nothing new to say here. (3.0)
S: Grapefruit & piney hops, mildly astringent. The malt seems to sit further back once this warms up. (4.0)
T: More of that great citrus hop taste is coming through than before. (4.0)
M: Way stickier than before and a little dry, but very pleasant. The taste lingers for a long time. (4.0)
O: As I said above, I should pour and then wait 15 minutes or so before reviewing. This is a very good DIPA. (4.0) 1,393 charactersmrand01, Nov 05, 2011

A: Clear amber orange with a white head with decent retention and nice lacing.
S: Lots of citrus, mainly orange. A touch of pine. Some tropical fruits, pineapple and mango. Deep, sweet carmel malts lurking in the background.
T: A lot like the nose. A burst of grapefruit, citrus, pineapple and sweet mango hops with a nice carmel malt backbone to round everything out. Finishes with a sharp pine bitterness. Very well done and balanced. 
M: Medium body, average carbonation, a bit slick feeling.
O: Great drinkability for a double IPA. Nice balance and the abv is hidden pretty damn well. This is the prototypical style of double IPA that I enjoy the most. Sweet tropical and citrus fruits with a solid malt backbone. 757 charactersherman77, Nov 04, 2011
4.67/5  rDev +6.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Cheers to rmalinowski4 for sending this my way
Consumed 11/1/11
Appearance: A dark orange with hints of gold, mostly clear but a little hazy - starts off with a nice white head, fades to some foam and sticky lacing - good, but could be better
Smell: A blast of citrus - orange and grapefruit flesh, some pith - some pine in here, too - hops are quite intense, but there are some pale malts underneath, some hints of a light biscuit... buried in a pile of citrus and pine
Taste: Hoppy with a bitterness that kicks you in the teeth - tons of orange, and grapefruit - flesh and pith - lots of pine, too - some other fruits - a slight malt base, honestly could be a bit stronger with the pure assault of hops, but who cares at this level of madness - some sweetness, but this is all about the bitterness - one of the most bitter DIPAs I've encountered - also just had a double-take at the ABV - is this really 9.5%? - doesn't taste like it at all
Mouthfeel: Medium body, some stickiness but mostly dry, nicely carbonated
Overall: Masterful
I'm glad I finally had a chance to try this one. It's probably one of the most bitter beers I've ever tasted. It's also one of the best DIPAs I've ever had. It's up there with Pliny the Elder, Heady Topper, Gandhi-Bot, and Hopslam for me. Simply great, and now I must get more. 1,320 charactersangrybabboon, Nov 01, 2011
4.7/5  rDev +7.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5When I heard Three Floyds was coming back to Ohio, I was excited, mostly because they are known for their IPA's and Double IPA's and I, coincidentally, love IPA's. Of their stable of IPA's, Dreadnaught was heralded as one of their better IPA offerings. So, what better to put me in a good mood after a bad Browns loss than to sample some of this elixir?
Poured from a 22 oz bomber into a tulip glass. Pours a slighlty hazy copper color, with a two finger creme colored head that leaves moderate lacing as it is swirled.
Spicy and fruity smelling, there's mango, pineapple, white pepper, citrus, and tobacco all melding and mixing for just a heavenly aroma. Pine boughs and juniper berries help complete the scene, all supported by a honey sweet malt backbone. 
Taste is sublime! Sweet and spicy to start, with pineapple and grapefruit, giving way to a leafy, almost earthy malt middle, before finishing with a tongue drying hop bitter to finish. The hops, though oily, are not too resinous, and while bitter, are not too dry. Poweful, yet balanced, this is what a DIPA is supposed to taste like.
Medium to full bodied, this is a brew to be savored. The intense bitter leaves the tongue and gums tingling, and while this ale has lingering bitterness, it is not dry to the point of distraction.
Wow, this is an awesome DIPA, and is by far the best of the Three Floyds I've tried thus far. Hoppy, fruity, malty, spicy and bitter, it combines all the traditional touchstones of a good DIPA without going too far on any one of them. An absolute must try, and one which I will snap up again if I can find it. 1,607 charactersTheHoppiest, Oct 31, 2011

S: This beer smells great. You get a bunch of peach and citrus. Maybe a little grapefruit as well. The hops smell is exceptional on this beer. Doesn't get much better than this in my book.
T: Wow is that a great taste. So smooth and well balanced. The hop taste is exceptional and is tamed at the end with a subtle malt and caramel undertone. I can't tell you how much I like this beer! It's a great hop flavor with mild bitterness up front and a great finish.
M: Easy and smooth on the tongue. Mouthfeel is almost as good as the taste.
O: This is such a great beer. I've only had this a couple of times, but I hope to have it again! I only see it every now and then at the local places, even though I live in Indiana. Definitely give this one a try if you see it at your local purveyor of fine beverages. 915 charactersgratefuld, Oct 30, 2011
4.47/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 22oz bottle into a Duvel tulip. Received in a trade with rfraga77. Many thanks!
A: Absolutely crystal clear beer that is on the golden side of orange in color. Mildly aggressive pour leads to a one finger head the ever-so-slowly disappears leaving a lace slug-trail on its way down.
S: God damn. This is fresh and this is stupendous. Easily one of, if not the nicest smelling beers I've ever smelled. This, PtE, and Citra are the holy trinity of hop-forward IIPAs. Piney first, followed by the zesty snap of grapefruit rind. A touch of alcohol on the tail end of the nose lets you know it means business.
T: Delicious. Follows the nose almost directly with exception of the hop profiles switching roles. The citrus hits first followed by a nice balance of malt, with the pine-hop rounding out the taste at the back end. I may have been expecting a touch more out of this with such a stellar nose than I actually received, hence only the 4 for taste. "Only." 
M: Medium-high level of carbonation lifts the oils right off of your tongue and sends em straight to the roof of your mouth leaving such a wonderfully bitter aftertaste that I've come to love with my all-star IIPAs. The alcohol creates a slight burn in the back of the throat and down to the belly but on a cold night, it's most welcomed. Oily sticky aftertaste lingers on and on. It's certainly a palate killer, but if it wasn't, I'd be disappointed.
O: Top notch. One of the best IIPAs I've ever had. I'm an IIPA freak too and it's really no surprise given the reputation of this beer. That tends to make me a touch more skeptical going in though - maybe skeptical isn't the word, more careful. I'm careful not to let the previous reviews skew my own personal feelings on a beer and I think I gave this one a fair shake. This one settles in nicely on the podium with a bronze medal in IIPAs. I give the gold to Pliny the Elder, Silver to Citra, and bronze to Dreadnaught. Very, very well done, Three Floyds. Very well done indeed. 2,010 characterssuspect, Oct 30, 2011

Powerful aroma of sweet tropical fruit, honey and a touch of pine. Reminds me of a slightly maltier Hopslam. Taste follows the aroma, complex hops with just enough bready malt to hold up. Light on the tongue and highly drinkable. 316 charactersrab53, Oct 29, 2011
4/5  rDev -8.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Big thanks to Kayn169 for this and a number of other things from Three Floyds that have been big wants for a long time!
Appearance - This one pours with a brilliant yellow golden color, slightly hazy, with a head of a little more than 2 fingers of fluffy white foam. Head sticks around beautifully lasting through me writing this section and the smell section and some of the taste as well, leaving lots of sticky lace around the sides.
Smell - In my reviewing of this I take note of the appearance, the head, then jump right to the smell section. Wonderfully aromatic hops waft from this beer after the cap is popped and it is poured into the glass. The hops at play here are very citrus, lemon, peach, grapefruit, mango and tropical fruit with some herb and pine in there also. Caramel malt lends some sweetness and balancing nature without coming off as bready or "malty," oh no, the hops are the mainstay here. Honey smell in there as well.
Taste - Follows the nose pretty well citrusy-orange hops, lemongrass, those are the main properties I get. Not quite as pronounced are the tropical fruits, the peach, the mango, the pineapple, the pine, some floral qualities (maybe that's just all the sweetness talking), with honey-like sweetness, a substantial caramel malt backbone that still mostly takes a backseat to the hops, slight bready-ness, but swept away by a moderate bitterness on the end. Hops are the main attraction but they aren't crazy out of control as the malt backbone is solid and keeps things balanced and under control without being dominant. Nice and complex.
Mouthfeel - Smooth consistency, moderate, creamy carbonation, medium body, and a finish that is a bit shorter lived than "average length." Very nice and drinkable, especially with the higher ABV.
Overall - Essentially 4.0s across the board. Overall, a wonderful DIPA. I don't know that I can put it in my top 5, quite a competitive group those five, but it's certainly within my top 15, maybe even my top 10...but we'll have to see about that once I've tried Arctic Panzer Wolf and Apocalypse Cow, both of which I also recieved from Kayn169! Thanks again, Jason! Can't wait to crack the others. Anyways, definitely do yourself a favor and try this beer if you like IPAs/DIPAs. It's a good one. 2,280 charactersmatttttYCE, Oct 28, 2011

A- Cloudy, toasted brown. Very light head and hardly any lacing at all.
S- Not overly fragrant. Just a bit of warm hops and hay.
T- Smooth. Almost too smooth. Nothing punching me in the face like I want from an Imperial IPA. That said it has a distinctive taste profile, the hops followed by a touch of sweetness, caramel, strawberries. A solid hop finish. 9.5% wow, to hide it this well is working magic.
M- Crisp, slightly sugary on tongue.
O- A solid beer. I wouldn't mind sessioning this. Another I would like to try on draft. Three Floyds never fails, but this isn't my very favorite. 632 charactersNachojon, Oct 28, 2011

T: Mellow earthy/tropical hops up front; expands along the middle with a slight malty backbone; finishes with a deliciously sweet/bitter finish. Definitely not the fruity hop-bomb I was expecting, but still very delicious. 
M: Medium carbonation; medium-thick viscosity, yet somehow still refreshing

A: Pours a beautiful pure gold with 1 full finger of fluffy white head. The bubbles clear quickly, but leave a thick film along the edges of the glass. There is some serious lacing as it drinks.
S: Smells mainly of lemons. Citrus, but no huge grapefruit notes. There is also an earthiness in the nose, like slightly roasted malt and pine.
T: Starts off sweet, with a hit of tropical fruits. It then shifts to essences of pine and lemon. But there is always a sweet tropical fruit presence to balance it out. The finish is a little bitter, but nothing too strong.
M: Full bodied beer. On occasion you'll feel the need to chew this beer down. It coats the palate nicely with out leaving any harsh flavors behind.
O: A really quality beer. I've had this brew before, but I'm enjoying is more now, than ever. If this were available in my area, I'd pick it up on occasion. 910 characterstrxxpaxxs, Oct 24, 2011

M: medium-bodied with a great level of carbonation. Cuts throught the maltiness without being overbearing
O: A very well-balanced beer, and one that is a hallmark of its respective style. When I think of midwestern DIPA's, I think of this one 629 charactersKeithstone44, Oct 24, 2011
4.5/5  rDev +2.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A - After a moderate pour I was left with a glass full of golden hued brew and a great fluffy white head, showcasing solid retention/ lacing
S - Citrusy hop presence is upfront with noticeable grapefruit characteristics. A piney profile makes it's presence known much more subtly. 
T - The flavor profile showcases piney resinous hops much more than the citrusy nose would've led me to believe. The caramel malt backbone of this brew is present, but just enough to hold up the hops and make sure it doesn't take center stage. 
M - A great medium body and level of carbonation make this a great brew. A slight dryness upon finish is also quite pleasant.
O - An amazingly delicious IIPA. The citrusy nose, combined with piney/ caramel taste make this a complex brew that should satisfy everyone. I could definitely drink more than I need to if I had this readily available... 877 charactersEnJeiBee, Oct 23, 2011
4.7/5  rDev +7.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from bomber into Urthel tulip glass, with roughly a finger off-white head.
Initial smell is of pears, peaches, pineapple. Lots of pineapple this time. But it fluctuates. Very light and harmless alcohol buried in there.
Update: poured bomber into CBS snifter and caught excellent mango all day. In aroma and taste!!!!
(Second ~6 oz. pour from bomber yielded far more malt, caramel and toasty, but still excellent amount of hops aroma and taste!)
Quick bitter bite up front leads into smooth citrus fruits, mango, more pineapple. Nicely spiced, little malt presence right now -- will wait to see what I find as it warms to room temperature. Nice crispness, to say the least. 
Resiny mouthfeel that thins over time. Pretty OK carbonation. 
Overall, this is just one of the standards in my book. It's an Imperial IPA that's rarely challenged, here in the Midwest. It's fruity, bitter, drinkable, and supremely balanced for its style as it warms up. 
No complaints here, just praise. 992 charactersrangel2, Oct 22, 2011

Acquired via trade
Thanks dannyfrost!
Clear amber with a thin, though persistent, off-white head. Spots of lacing left down the glass.
Floral and piney aroma with just a hint of alcohol warmth. This is missing the tropical and pungent hop aromas I was hoping for and found in other Three Floyds beers, specifically Zombie Dust and even Gumballhead.
Moderate to high bitterness, a touch of sweet and bready malts, with a strong pine and floral hop presence. There's just a hint of alcohol heat as well.
Medium mouthfeel with ample carbonation.
Certainly a good DIPA and one I'd love to try again, but I ended up a bit disappointed with this one considering it's reputation. 692 charactersehammond1, Oct 21, 2011
4.18/5  rDev -4.8%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 422oz bomber courtesy of Agold in the 100% Satisfaction BIF.
Appearance: Poured about 2/3 of the bomber hard into a 20oz imperial nonic glass. Nearly 3 fingers of big fluffy white white with absolutely gorgeous lacing coat the glass. The color of the beer itself is a light orange pushing towards maybe a dark golden. If this isn't a 5 for appearance, I don't know what is.
Smell: Very piney, with a surprisingly strong malt aroma for an IPA. A nice amount of citrus layers itself into the nose.
Taste: Strong pine taste, followed by some citrus, and a decent amount of malt to balance it out - I believe I'm getting mostly caramel from the malt. Obviously bitter. Very boozy - not completely out of the ballpark for a DIPA, but more than I traditionally care for. Probably the only real big knock I can make on this beer.
Mouthfeel: Solid body with oily hop resins on the tongue. Well carbed.
Drinkability: High. It's quite thirst quenching for a 9.5% DIPA, I will drink the entire bomber easily.
Overall: This is a very good beer, but the strong alcohol burn stands in the way of perfection. That's ok though - still one that I'd happily drink again. 1,157 characterscbeer88, Oct 21, 2011

This bottle was obtained via the Partners BIF...split two ways with Stigs. Poured into a Piraat tulip.
A solid 2 fingers of off-white head formed on top of the hazy, sunset amber body. The bubbles receded slowly, leaving behind trails of lace.
The nose finds lots of citrus and pine...pretty much what you would expect out of a highly rated DIPA. 
The taste is just as the nose indicates...piney up front, turning sweet toward the center with a resin-bitter finish. The undertone throughout is a sweet, grainy backbone.
Medium bodied, sticky with moderate carbonation.
This is a really good, quality beer...just what you would expect from FFF. Right up there with the leaders of the style. 765 charactersmgbickel, Oct 20, 2011

A- pours a light medium amber color with a fluffy two fingers of fluffy off white head. Good retention with some lacing involoved!
S- huge citrusy hop aromas of mango, ruby red grapefruit and tangerine. Hints of floral hop notes mingle with a touch light toffee malt aromas. Finishes with some hemp and hop oil.
T- starts off with some malt sweetness with notes of toffee. Giant tropical fruit hop flavor balances out the sweetness with mango and papaya. Juicy citrus ruby red grapefruit and tangerine blend in as well. Finishes with an awesome even biterness and a lingering hop flavor!
MF- slick smooth mouthfeel with a medium body and soft carbonation.
D- average drinkability.
Overall an excellent Imperial IPA with major tropical fruit flavor. More please. 805 charactersViciousknishs, Oct 20, 2011

A - A standard pour results in a finger of fluffy white head. The beer is cloudy enough that it obscures the light behind it just enough to make it hard to see the bubbles within. The color is a hazy amber. Very nice lacing, the bubbles stretch to the top of the glass.
S - Sweet tropical fruit bouquet to start. I could smell it the instant I cracked the cap. I'm smelling pineapple, mango, and a touch of grapefruit that bitters the aroma nicely. Perhaps something like a sweet tangerine or clementine as well. I can smell a caramel aroma as well.
T - Taste is intense with hops. Follows the nose closely. Bitterness backed by strong tropical fruit flavors. Malt comes in as a caramel flavor and an ever-present sweetness that balances the bitterness perfectly. Amazing finish of mango and pineapple. 
M- Medium bodied. Nice sparkly feel from the carbonation. Goes down smooth, yet lively. The drying finish is perfect. Sometimes you'll have a beer dry your mouth a bit too much, but this one is absolutely perfect in the degree of dryness you experience.
O - Really delicious, I could down glass after glass -- even if the %age would make that an ill-advised decision. 1,361 charactersgreenmonstah, Oct 19, 2011

Nice mild sweet citrus nose. Mild floral hops. Nice and pleasant but not amazing.

Light bodied. High carb. Crisp. Mildly fresh. 
Overall I am a little disappointed by this. I had pretty high hopes. After having Zombie Dust which was outstanding, this is just a miss. Although still good, not what it should be. 551 charactersMrVonzipper, Oct 18, 2011

S - Hops galore, mostly tropical and citrus. Mangoes, peaches, grapefruit come to mind, maybe some orange zest. Lots of kush... oh yea! Some spicy herbal hops and malt sweetness peak out in the background. Alcohol is hardly spotted beneath the hop chaos. Pretty damn nice.
T - Sweet hop nectar, hop juice, resinous hop beverage. Whatever you want to call it, this is it. Hops are everywhere. It's not to the point where I can't handle it, but I can feel the palate getting ruined with each gulp. Sweet fruity, citrus and tropical hops at first and some pine and resinous dank to finish things out. Pure hops on the burp. I can tell this is a hopheads special, and I'm really feeling it. Sweet candied hops, alcohol presence is lacking (in a scary "get you hammered" type of way).
M - Hop bitterness, hop oils. Expect a hoppy bitter feel. Low to moderate carbonation with medium to full body.
O - A must try beer for DIPA fans. This was only the 2nd time for me having this beer, but I'd say it's my 2nd top DIPA behind Hopslam. A nice balance of hops and more hops. A hopheads delight. I'm guessing this beer was very fresh because I tried it the first time I saw it on the shelf here in Ohio. I'll have it again and again in the future. 1,355 charactersBonis, Oct 17, 2011
4.47/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Orange amber with good lacing. Smell was pine resin and sweet malt. Taste was strongly aromatic pine resins, slight sweet malt appears, but bitterness coats the tongue and is lingering on the edges of the palate long finish. Mouthfeel is plush and the carbonation is nice. Overall it's a nice offering, but this one leans a little one-dimensionally to the pine resins.
Update 9/20/2012: 
2 weeks fresh, direct from FFF brewery. Wow. Fantastic. I think a freight train of fresh ripe pineapples has derailed in this room. Really, really good. 542 charactersJackieTH, Oct 17, 2011
4.21/5  rDev -4.1%look: 4 | smell: 3 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Poured into an Arrogant Bastard pint glass.
Appearance - A lively, bubbly amber/orange IPA. A thin but creamy whippable brew. Appears very fresh and heavily carbonated. 
Smell - Smells like your traditional IPA. Full of hops and citrus. A very spring-time smelling brew.
Taste - Woah. This is a very potent imperial IPA. A smooth, malty citrus and lemon zest carries heavily with breaded malts. Another unique brew from Three Floyds. Its pretty awesome how all of their IPA's taste radically different from one another. It definitely evens out after the first few sips to become more enjoyable.
Mouthfeel / Drinkability - Medium-bodied with a light burn on the end. Delicious malts and citrus. 697 charactersJesse13713, Oct 17, 2011
5/5  rDev +13.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This has and probably always will be one of my favorite beers. Tons of citrus and fruit notes from the hops which is perfectly balanced by the malts which lends a bit of sweetness but never takes away from the hop profile which is exqusite to say the least. Extremely drinkable to the point where you're sad to see it go but glad it went down 342 charactersMitchill, Oct 17, 2011

A - Beautiful golden color. Cloudy with a thick one finger fluffy white head. 
S - Floral and citrus. 
T - Wonderfully balanced. Wash of hop bitterness up front. Pineapple and citrus fruits. Excellent malt finishes rounds out the bitterness. 
M - Ridiculously smooth. Medium mouth feel with incredible drinkability. 
O - FFF nailed it. An exceptional DIPA. Will definitely revist this one. 472 characterslangm12, Oct 17, 2011
4.47/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Obtained from West Lakeview Liquor. Pours a hazy orange color with a nice size white head. Good lacing and better than average retention.
Great smell!! Citrus hops and mango...reminds me of Legend II IPA with the mango aroma and flavor.
Taste is very good as well, bitter, with mango and citrus as the drivers. This one goes down real easy and has enough head shrinking bitterness to satisfy most hop heads.
Rich and crisp mouthfeel, plenty bitter and flavorful.
Overall a top notch DIPA. 492 charactersJayQue, Oct 13, 2011
4.6/5  rDev +4.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Three Floyds Dreadnaught is a delicious double IPA that mixes the floral and citrus characters of hops. The hops provide much aroma and flavour without much bitterness and you will barely tastes the 9.5% alcohol. Well done Three Floyds!
A: Yellow/orange colour and a good 15 mm head that lasts very well. 4.5
S: Malty with floral hops. Some grapefruit. 4.5
T: Lovely malty base over hops that are a wonderful mix of floral and tart citrus (especially grapefruit). The alcohol isn't noticeable and neither is there much bitterness. Not as intensely hoppy as some other DIPAs but really delicious. 4.5
M: Foamy. 4.5

4.45/5  rDev +1.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5This beer pours a hazey ligh amber color. This one has an amazing smell to it. Right out front there is a citrus and pine followed by tropical fruits. The taste of this one is a lot like the smell. Massive hops and fruits such as grapefruit and pinneapple. I would say the mouthfeel is great on this beer as well because it leaves you wanting more. This is probaly my go to beer whenever I want a good IPA. 406 charactersLabonix, Oct 10, 2011
4.35/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A- Translucent caramel, cloudy, small bubbles, frothy two-finger head in a pint glass. Small amount of foam (tough to call it lacing) hangs down the inside of the glass as it empties.
S- Floral, citrus, slightly subdued compared to the taste, as with many IPAs.
T- Hop-forward, citrus, mango, peach, pine. Well-supported by the malt. Great balance is a great way to describe this beer.
M- I would expect this to be heavier than it is, but that's not a bad thing. Dangerously easy drinking (unless you've never had an IPA), the only reminder that this is 9.5% ABV is the warm feeling on the back of my throat.
Overall, a great IPA, but not the best ever. For the price, it's hard to say that it's something I would purchase too often, but then again it's not meant to be purchased often. 790 charactersschanker21, Oct 08, 2011
4.7/5  rDev +7.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Bomber poured into a SA Perfect Pint 
A - Pours a wonderful golden color with a 1 finger thick, off white head. Lacing remains for the full duration of the pint.
S - Citrus, Pine, Hops, and Grapefruit
T - Sweet up front with a bit of pine; followed by bitterness and citrus. There is a slight bite from the alcohol but it seems relatively well hidden. 
M - Smooth...so very smooth! Just the right level of carbonation. 
O - A wonderful example of an Imperial IPA. Given the chance I would drink this all the time. 518 charactersCoachaloach, Oct 07, 2011
4.09/5  rDev -6.8%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Pours a hazy coppered-orange with a 3 finger off-white head- reduces quickly to a soapy ring with really sticky lace.
Awesomely hoppy nose of ripe citrus and waxy tropical notes with a good dose of pine too- mango, ruby red grapefruit, papaya, peach, grassy lemon mint. Vague hints of pale malt and orange blossom honey waaay in the background. Of all the IPAs I've had in my day, this is the first one that really made me think of ganga. Very pungent.
Despite the pungent, in-your-face literally, nose, the palate achieves a balance so harmonious that it seems at times to sail by unnoticed. Starting full-bodied and moderately oily, the hops send wave after wave of bitterness, but the brew has enough sweetness coming from all angles to keep the whole ride in check, yet it never approaches being too malty. Flavors are mostly piney and earthy with some faint citrus and malt until the boozy pepper makes an appearance on the finish. Overall, very juicy and delicious, with my one complaint being that the beer finishes a little short.
So glad to finally pick up one of these. A very solid DIPA that I'd be happy to drink anytime. And drink fast too, with that shorter finish and very well-hidden alcohol. 1,211 charactersTheWhiskerReview, Oct 06, 2011
3.78/5  rDev -13.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Poured from a 22 oz bottle into a La Fin Du Monde tulip
A: Pours a hazy golden/orange, 2 fingers frothy head, beautiful lacing, light head retention, unusual color, almost like a mixed drink!
S: Citrus and Mango, really, the label doesn't lie! Maybe nectarines. Some mellow pinieness. Malts on the end, and some booze.
T: Mango flavor stands out, followed by a piney/boozy mix. Pretty good, but other DIPAs I like hide the booze better
M: a bit grainy, hot, but suits the overall experience.
O: A good, not great, brew. 524 charactersroodie, Oct 04, 2011
4.1/5  rDev -6.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4A: Pours a clear, honey-gold with three fingers of off-white head that fades into a frothy cap with good lacing.
S: Lots of pineapple and grapefruit aromas on the nose. Smells like a lovely, sweet, tropical boquet.
T: Grapefruit dominates the palate with some lightly sweet pineapple notes. Pine notes with some grassy flavors follow with a decent bitterness that lingers on the finish. Slight alcohol burn on the finish.
M: Medium body and carbonation, this beer has a relatively light body but has an oily resin feel from the bitterness that lingers.
O: A good DIPA. Not the best in the world and overpriced, but still quite good. It's on the bitter side for my tastes, but not too bad. 692 charactersn2185, Oct 04, 2011
4.11/5  rDev -6.4%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4650 mL bottle poured into a goblet.
Appearance - Hazy golden body with a nice, strangely tinted head to it. The head itself has a yellowish tinge. Beautiful lacing on the glass and wisps of foam atop the beer.
Smell - Very hoppy, but a strange aroma. Lemony citrus that has almost a soapy character to it. Reminds me of YuleSmith Summer. The sweetness behind it combines to enhance this. I like the hoppiness, but the soap flavor is off-putting.
Taste - That same soapy flavor extends into the taste, but the hops are still abundant. Lemon and grapefruit hops with a sweetness behind it. Very little bitterness in the finish. Perhaps it's too sweet, though.
Mouthfeel - Nearly perfect body to it. Nice carbonation and a clean finish. Just a hint of bitterness in the finish.
Overall - It has a strong hop profile, but not quite the hop flavors I like in an IPA. I feel lemon citrus makes beers smell and taste like Pine-Sol. Still good and something I'd enjoy regularly if I could. 986 charactersAlieniloquium, Oct 03, 2011
4.38/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from bomber into Duvel tulip - Latest release to Ohio.
A: Poured a deep golden hue with a three finger head that dissipated into a thin creamy ,frothy, lacing, good retention and webbing, decent carbonation.
S: Hops , slight pine, toffee, caramel.
T: Pretty much follows the nose, sweet malts with bitter hops,hints of citrus,grapefruit, slight toffee/caramel, pine notes as well.
O: Pretty solid DIPA, I love the toffee/carmel in the backing, great feel on the tounge. Will definitly have this again. 512 charactersInebriatedJoker, Oct 02, 2011
4.39/5  rDev 0%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Bomber courtesy of whitelightheat.
Poured into a tulip a hazy orange golden with a massive foamy off-white head. Lacing is present and the head becomes a light film near the end of the glass. Nose is all about the hops; splashes of grapefruit, lemon, citrus, floral, sharp pine-sol too. Taste is very much an American hop-bomb; grapefruit taste is dominant, very West Coast style. Its bitter and piney in the finish but not too drying, quite satisfying. Underneath it all is a slight biscuity malt profile that is only present enough to balance the IIPA and not detract form its hop dominance. Slick and oily mouthfeel, resinous, medium to heavily bodied.
Overall, a highly enjoyable and very drinkable DIPA from Three Floyds. 727 charactersheebes, Oct 02, 2011
4.69/5  rDev +6.8%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5A - Pours a solid orange/amber, a bit hazy with small, 1 finger head that has great retention and leaves a good amount of lacing along the sides.
S - Great smell. A wallop of all the great things about an IPA--hops. Grapefruit, orange and citrus, even a good amount of pine. Decent maltiness present as well. It's the perfect blend of a sweet/bitter smell.
T - Another right hook of hops. Again a perfect blend of grapefruit and pine. The bitterness of the hops is almost too much until it fades into a lemony-sweet finish, a tad bit of pucker. Dashes of zest and honey, a bit of bread, just a full, robust taste present here.
M - Nothing negative to say about the mouthfeel, with something so bitter and an high ABV, you would expect it to dry the mouth or something, but it's incredibly smooth. The carbonation holds well and the burn of the alcohol is ever so slight.
Overall - A brilliant beverage here, great balance to this IPA. So glad that Three Floyds has come back to Ohio. Just a wonderful beer here. 1,015 charactersBeerBuckeye, Oct 01, 2011
4.69/5  rDev +6.8%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Three Floyds : Dreadnaught
Ontap, appears a clear golden color, small head and some wisps of lace on the glass. Aroma is nothing short of spectacular, notes of pine, pineapple, grapefruit zest, sweet pine juice. West coast IPA all the way, baby. In the taste, tropical bitterness. Muted pineapple almost bordering into mango, but overshadowed by a wall of bitterness. Lots of pine, sweet complimentary malt, but the sweetness is mild and short livid. Solidly bitter, and bitter all the way through. Medium bodied. Overall, one of the best double IPAs I have come accross. Exceptional. 585 charactersStinkypuss, Sep 30, 2011
4.67/5  rDev +6.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.522oz bomber purchased from the brewery in Munster, IN.
Pours a slightly hazed, golden amber hue with two fingers of billowy, off-white foam and sheets of lacing on the nonic glass. Beautiful, glowing appearance on this brew. 
Smell is deep citrusy orange rind, clementine, pineapple, papaya, tangerine, fruity esters (alcohol), floral and woody hops, perfume, pine needle, peach, red grapefruit, and white cracker. A very tropical, aromatic nose in the west coast mold. 
Taste is big bold layers of juicy and fleshy navel orange, peach, nectarine, caramel, jujube candy, pineapple and honey sweetness, mango, biscuit, lemon, and a smooth, citric hop bitterness with white grapefruit and pine needle on the cough. This beer assaults the taste buds with a pungent onslaught of intense hop flavours. An absolutely delicious ale.
Mouthfeel is slick and oily, fuller than medium bodied, juicy middle, spicy hop bite precedes a long and resinous hop bitterness with a mildly drying finish. Quite the nuanced palate here. 
Overall, this world-beating DIPA is in a class of its own. Dreadnaught has everything that a hop head could ask for, and I enjoyed savouring my bottle over the course of an hour. Seek this one out. 1,218 characterscratez, Sep 29, 2011
4.75/5  rDev +8.2%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 522oz bottle poured into a snifter. 
A: Beautiful golden with a touch of orange. Slight haze. Half finger head, with decent retention, but Beautiful lacing. Color and clarity remind me of Pliny.
S: Oh yeah, can tell this is fresh. Huge citrus hops. Pineapple and grapefruit blend beautifully. Touch of lemon, slight orange peels. A very sweet caramel comes through, with a hint of toastiness.
T: Sweet caramel with a touch of lemon. Then a bittersweet grapefruit with notes of pine apple. Bitterness is up with the top of what I've had. The assault of the taste buds that I'm after once and a while. Caramel never gets the chance to come back. A touch of alcohol in the finish.
M: Medium bodied. Just right carbonation edging on the high side. Slight creaminess. Hops Everywhere in the mouth. A slight burn in the throat from alcohol.
O: Amazing beer. Love it! Alcohol shines through a tad to much, but if your looking for a hop Assault, this is it! Pliny is blended better, but Dreadnaught is much more bitter. Different styles of the same style if you know what I mean. Love it! Just the slightest notch below Pliny. 1,122 charactersdoughanson78, Sep 28, 2011
4.37/5  rDev -0.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.522oz bottle. 
A- Pours a slightly hazy yellow color with orange highlights. A thick foamy head leaves nice rings of lace. 
S- Citrus hop bomb in the nose. Tropical fruits, ruby red grapefruit, pineapple, and tangerine. Very very nice aroma. 
T- Much like the nose except the tropical fruit flavor is a bit muted. Slightly more one dimensional with the bitterness. The alcohol is apparent in the finish. 
M- Sticky and dry with good carbonation. 
O- The nose on this is truly exceptional. I feel like I'm nitpicking a little but the flavor doesn't quite live up to the nose and the alcohol is a bit unrestrained. Still a very solid DIPA and worthy of its status among the elite. 687 charactersprojectflam86, Sep 28, 2011
4.64/5  rDev +5.7%look: 5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Bomber picked up at the brewpub
A - Clear with bubbles popping up like a champagne. 1 finger head with great lacing, very fresh bottle.
S - Smells like pine, citrus.
T - Amazing. Reminds of a West Coast IPA, and why wouldn't it. Piny notes, with grapefruit and mango, maltiness throughout, finishes dry. 
M - Complexity mixed with simple drinkability. Very close to Lagunita's HopStoopid in IBU, but far more drinkable, close to the level of Pliny the Elder. 
O - Nothing wrong here, maybe the price. If you have access to this beer try it, if you don't, trade for it to compare it with other stellar IPA. Don't drink this baby too cool, I have tried this beer at several temperatures, and I'm really liking this one which is cellared at 50 degrees. 754 charactersMidnightWatch, Sep 27, 2011

Golden orange body with nice lacing and a small white head.
Tropical, citrus, peach, floral.
Juicy sweet up front with tropical, stone and citrus fruits. Good malt backbone. The finish is remarkably dry.
High carbonation, creamy body. Smooth and complex. 306 charactersaficionado, Sep 25, 2011
4.55/5  rDev +3.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Looks fabulous in my snifter. Kind of an orange marmalade color, teetering on the fence between opaque and translucent. The head is a finger of white foam. It sticks around for a couple minutes then disappears, leaving only lace on the inside of the glass.
Smells great too. The citrus scent from the peach and mango comes wafting up from the opening of the snifter and combine with a woody, piney scent.
In the mouth you get a battle from the sweet fruits and the bitter hops, each trying to establish dominance. It tastes like it smells.
For the type, it's extremely smooth, the 99 IBUs tempered by the acidity and the malt. There is certainly an IPA kick to it, but the bitter hops are balanced nicely by the other ingredients, allowing you to still feel your tongue after each sip.
About as close to perfect as an Imperial IPA can be. There are no obvious flaws. 870 charactersRickS95, Sep 25, 2011
4.33/5  rDev -1.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Picked this bomber up at the Three Floyds brewpub..
Appearance: electric looking golden yellow with a bright white head. The head never completely retreats into the beer; instead it forms a thin, persistent coat.
Smell: a wonderful citrus aroma with plenty of hop scent.
Taste: Tropical fruits; mango, peach, with an intense hop character. Surprisingly balanced though.. the malt usage seems to hold everything together very well.
Mouthfeel: though abundantly hopped, this beer has a surprisingly smooth mouthfeel.
Overall: Certainly one of my favorite DIPAs.. another excellent offering from Three Floyds. 611 charactersBlastBeats, Sep 23, 2011
4.54/5  rDev +3.4%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5A- Deep amber. Steady but thin head. Slight lacing. 
S- Amazing citrus and pine. Very intense as well. It's hard to imagine a more enticing aroma. 
T- Gigantic amounts of hops. Immediate bitterness. Imagine grapefruit juice aged with pine needles. Floral notes make it interesting and give it more depth to keep it from being just another hop bomb. 
There's a slight amount of malt, but it doesn't get near to playing a part with all the hops. 
M- Medium full body. Carbonation is average. The finish is very dry and slightly sticky. 
O- Incredibly drinkable and incredibly hoppy. The only thing that held me back was the gigantic amount of bitterness. This is one of the few examples I've had where I thought the bitterness should be toned down. There was a very fruity sweetness as well that clashed with the bitterness as well. 
I thought the flavors were very aggressive, but that the beer was still very solid. 921 charactersBBP, Sep 23, 2011

4.2/5  rDev -4.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Thanks to bastu for sending me this one!
Pours a murky honey orange with a 2 inch puffy orange-white head that settles to a small cap. Thin foamy rings of lace line the glass on the drink down. Smell is of tropical fruits (peach/mango) and some vanilla aromas. This smells like it could be slightly infected. Taste is of the tropical fruits, vanilla, malt, and citrus zest on the finish. Like I was sensing in the smell, there is a slightly infected taste that comes out as vanilla on this one but it surprisingly works well with the intended flavors. A medium hop bitterness sticks to the palate after each sip. This beer has a good carbonation level with a crisp and clean mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good DIPA with some nice tropical and citrus aromas and flavors. I would be interested to see how this one is without the non-intended vanilla aroma and flavor. 866 charactersUCLABrewN84, Sep 20, 2011
4.7/5  rDev +7.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from 22 oz. Bomber of course.
Pours like amber orange juice. Nice lacing and great head. Fresh Hops fill the nose along with piney and citric smell. Fruity mouthfeel and very frothy. Hoppy, and uhhh...hoppy. Malt, hops, carbonation all match perfectly...its like they all had a party together....Then HOPS sneaks back up again. Alcohol is nicely hidden here.
This is my GO TO IPA. If I have had my fair share of trials, this is waht I crave at the end of the day. I guess I am lucky to have this so readily available to me. I have had this numerous times and it NEVER disappoints. I even got my wife to taste it and thats a miracle....she enjoyed it.

A. Bright orange with pearl white head. 1 finger. Head retention is good and lacing is also good.
S. Light piny hops with orange and peachy apricot.
T. Moderate bitterness with a crisp finish. The citrus hops bring this beer nearly to the level of orange juice. Very tasty. Imagine having an orange pine tree hybrid.

4.5/5  rDev +2.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A: amber orange with suspended material, probably hops. Looks great so far. The head is large at first, then dissipates due to the size of the bubbles, leaving a nice off-white lacing. 
S: pineapple, citrus, pine, sweetness, and some bitter and floral hops
T: delectable. Tastes of grapefruit, pineapple, sweetness, and bitterness. Very tropical tasting, and a little on the sweet side of the balance. 
M: big feel, but crisp from carbonation and hop bitterness. Feels nice and sticky in the mouth, which lends toward the sweetness and then the malt flavor staying on the tongue. Just right for a DIPA. 
O: wonderful brew, and I bought 2 bottles immediately knowing I'd want them. It was $12/bottle at Binny's in Chicago, which is more than I'd like to pay, but this is one of the best DIPAs in the world. One just has to balance this with a 4 pack of 90 minute being $12. 876 charactersHolland, Sep 14, 2011

4.48/5  rDev +2.1%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Fresh 22oz bottle, courtesy of Brydeen and Yeahnatenelson, Poured into a tulip glass:
A: Pours golden orange, slightly hazy, with a fantastic 2+ finger white head, extremely tight bubbles, with great retention. Leaves lacing everywhere when it finally does start receding. 
S: Big tropical fruits: Mango, pineapple, tangerine, grapefruit. Fairly strong pine character and plenty of floral notes as well. Sweet malts give a candy character. 
T: HUGE tropical fruits with plenty of bittering pine, some floral notes, and a touch of herbal dankness. It's mango madness! The alcohol has a little tiny bit of burn and adds a spiciness to the hop-flavor upfront. There's a pretty big, sweet malt base that gives candied fruit character, though it's not overly sweet like some DIPAs. Finish is semi dry (dries out through the aftertaste) with a some alcohol warmth, lots of lingering pine. The slightly dank tropical fruit flavors fade a little in intensity from the beginning to middle, but they then just linger on for a long damn time. Definitely what I'd call a massive tropical fruit-forward DIPA. 
M: Medium body, moderate carbonation. Extremely resinous and sticky, still fairly smooth and slick though. The "drinkability" is what sets the other top DIPAs from this: A little too boozy (comparatively), not super clean, not as easy of a finish as the 8%ABV group of DIPAs. 
O: Another fantastic DIPA with awesome mango. Once this warms up a bit, the fruit flavors become nearly explosive and the alcohol drops out for the most part. As potent and hoppy as it gets, but fairly well balanced for a DIPA. 1,606 charactersSatchboogie, Sep 09, 2011
4.5/5  rDev +2.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A - Pours a bright orange color and a hazy consistency. There was a big, foamy, long-lasting head. Nice lacing.
S - Wonderful citrus, floral aroma. Slight pine scent in the background.
T - Big citrus hops upfront. Juicy grapefruit and lots of sweet malts follow with some flavors of caramel and mango. Finish brings some more hops with a touch of pine.
M - I would have expected this to be an overly thick beer but not so. More of a medium mouth feel. You can definitely feel the bitterness on every taste.
O - This was my first beer from Three Floyd's and it did not let me down. An amazing IPA that I've been waiting to try to a long time. 645 charactersSkiBum22, Sep 08, 2011
4.97/5  rDev +13.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured into my effin gruven snifter from a 22oz bomber served at fridge temp on Labor Day.
IT pours a golden, bright, hazy, orange color with a white head that seems to dissapear rather quickly. After swirling for a while it leaves a descent lacing on the glass.
The aroma is really incredible. Pure hops..citrus, pine and a little floral with grapfruit taking the spotlight followed by tropical fruits.
The taste, pure hop juice. Its unbelievable how much hop flavor is packed into each sip. Orange is the most dominant among all the flavors, it is probably the most orange dominant DIPA that I have had. 
Mouthfeel is incredible. Fullbodied and very creamy with a slight, slight, slight alcohol presence that is barely worth mentioning. For the amount of hop flavor it is suprising that this beer isnt more bitter. It is definitley bitter, but not as bitter as one would expect. And i'm not getting that resiny feel that I would get in most DIPA's.
Had no problem drinking 22oz. of this beer. Actually a friend had a small glass from it but if I had more I would have had no problem opening up another bottle. This is 100% worth seeking out, hop head or not. 1,165 charactersMikeyMikee, Sep 07, 2011
4.22/5  rDev -3.9%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Pours a hazy yellow amber, with a thick two finger head with good retention, that trails and sticks nicely down the glass. Aroma was not as powerful as I expected, smells of pine, grapefruit, mango and citrus. Very very well balanced on the palate grapefruit, peach, even a little bit of strawberry, moderate hop bitterness and subdued caramel malt flavors. Oily but slick, does not leave a resinous hop mess on the palate, but it satiates the tongue nicely. Very drinkable, perhaps too much soo if that is possible, could get dangerous with these around on a hot summer day =). I do wish there was a bit more bitterness here, but I guess the beer doesnt really need it.
EDIT: 1/2 the way through my first bomber, this thing just keeps getting better and better 762 charactersmanitouman84, Sep 03, 2011
4.62/5  rDev +5.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured a 22 oz bomber into a pint glass. The appeance is a light copper with a 1/2 in of head. A wonderful delicate lacing followed.
This beer had me at the first sniff. The nose was full of delightful peach, mango, and grapefruit scents. 
The taste was fell of the same sensations as the smell with the addition of a bit of pine. The malts stayed undercover for the most part, just offsetting bitterness enough.
The mouthfeel was full and gave the sensation of a well carbonated beer with no hint of alcohol. I felt like this was a round mouthfeel, full and without edges.
A very good DIPA supporting my afinity for this style and this brewer. 644 charactersBadbobx, Aug 31, 2011
4.63/5  rDev +5.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5A 22oz bomber poured into a tulip glass.
A: Poured a nice two-finger head that held nicely during my first few sips but then mostly disappeared afterward. Still, a lovely lace that remained for the beer's entirety. A deep, orange pumpkin color that doesn't get too dark for the style.
S: Pine, grapefruit and mango. A solid, middle-of-the-road aroma that doesn't err too far towards floral or fruity, but sits comfortably in between. Nothing that blew me away, but interesting enough for me to pursue.
T: Everything that a DIPA should be. Wonderful complexity of flavor that, again, rides between floral and fruity, yet does so with a solid hand in each court (rather than being boring and indecisively neither). Hoppy and bitter without the typical over-riding malty sweetness, and yet there is the perfect malt backbone to support everything. This is clearly the aspect of this bear that wins it it's renown.
M: Appropriately carbonated, though perhaps erring on the lower end. Certainly nothing that detracts from the taste, which is what lingers on the tongue well after that first sip.
O: While I may wish the head had more perseverance, the smell had more punch, and the mouthfeel just a hair more carbonation, the taste is literally perfect. While not decidedly floral, piney or fruity, it is varied without being indecisive. It also nails the malt/hop balance without being too sweet, which is a true rarity for DIPAs. Perfectly supported, wonderful flavor, and no over-riding malty sweetness... what more can you ask from your DIPA? 1,546 charactersKnecht, Aug 30, 2011

4.2/5  rDev -4.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Had this on-tap at Three Floyd's brewpub. Poured into a half pint.
A: Pours a dark golden apple color with a fluffy 1 finger white head. Has some decent retention and leaves a nice sticky lace on the way down.
S: I'm picking up some citrus hops right of the bat. A little combination of lemon and lime peels with an orange zest. A sweet malty caramel backbone shines through at the end.
T: Nice caramel malts from the nose shine through more on the tongue and are the perfect compliment to fresh citrus hops that flourish in this brew. It has a mild bitterness on the finish with a slight alcohol taste merged in there, but there is no burn.
M: Light bodied with a nice carbonation. Has a nice vine/grass and woody finish on the palate.
O: Another great DIPA from FFF. I love tasting the differences between each one and this one is no different. Great beer and perfectly balanced. 886 charactersTreebs, Aug 27, 2011
4.36/5  rDev -0.7%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5A: The color of honey, mostly clear, just the smallest hint of a haze. Nice cloudy white head, that seems to last for quite a while. 
S: Bid pine smell with resin and some slight fruity smells. Classic American hop scents all the way. 
T: The taste follows the smell. Huge resiny pine flavor, juniper, and some earthy notes. There is a nice sweet kick in the finish, while this is very heavy on the hops, the finish kinda balances it out. The alcohol very well hidden. 
M: Medium heavy, with a slightly higher carbonation level. The carbonation balances out the body a bit. There is almost a syrupy, or oily texture to it. 
O: Overall very enjoyable. Strong, hoppy, and bold. Enough malt that there is some balance, but not enough to detract from the hops. 760 charactersBeejay, Aug 27, 2011

3.74/5  rDev -14.8%look: 3 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 422oz bottle, thanks to sobeleg. This one was poured into my Bruery tulip.
Dreadnaught pours a slightly hazy light orange. The white head eventually hits two fingers in height, and shows pretty good head retention. Outside of a solid ring marking the foam's high point, lacing is pretty spotty though. The aroma is a bit underwhelming in the intensity department, but it delivers plenty of tropical fruit notes, with some prominent citrus aromas present as well. There's a distinct, yet subtle caramel sweetness at the open of each sip. The bitterness it makes way for is remarkably restrained for a double IPA. The hoppy back end starts off as wonderfully fruity as the nose is, but midway through the trademark bitter grapefruit flavor of Centennial crashes the party. Whatever other hops are used for late additions do an admirable job of blunting the harshness of Centennial hops, but it does ultimately shine through a bit, to the beer's detriment. The body is impressively spry for a beer approaching double digit ABV, but the carbonation is just a little too dull. Dreadnaught's a decent imperial IPA, but I find it's 3 Floyds stablemate Arctic Panzer Wolf to be the clearly superior brew. 1,196 charactersaxeman9182, Aug 23, 2011
4.2/5  rDev -4.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Bottle with no freshness date, poured into a pint glass.
Light orange in appearance with a moderate haziness and two fingers of egg-white head that leaves an intricate web of lacing as it rescinds. A bit lighter than most imperials I've had, but still looks citrusy sweet and delicious.
I could already smell this not a second after cracking the bottle. Whiffs of tropical fruit: serious peach, mango, pineapple and grapefruit plus some grass. Complimentary lemon rind and a pronounced malt sweetness that lends itself to strike a perfect balance.
Although the bottle claims this to be a "hophead's dream", they seem completely absent. I'm sure that's more of a freshness issue than anything, but I have no idea when this was bottled. Plethora of tropical citrus present throughout accompanied by copious amounts of caramel undertones. Little to no bitterness or alcohol burn, meaning this has been sitting around for a while, but still really enjoyable.
Medium bodied with a creamy, slick nature and ample carbonation. Dangerously drinkable and a little deceiving for the 9.5% ABV. Right on for the style.
I thoroughly enjoyed this beer, but the bottom line for IPA's is to get them fresh, unless of course, its DFH 120. I'd love to trade for a fresh one, but the problem is that it's luck of the draw as FFF really needs to get on their game with bottling dates. Great beer, but I'm sure its better right off the bottling line. Cheers! 1,442 charactersmocktm, Aug 22, 2011

A - Slightly hazy bright gold color. One finger white head that leaves a good wall of lacing.
S - Holy hops batman. This is a grapefruit bomb. Big 'C' hops with citrus, grapefruit and mango aromas. Some sticky sweet malt is there in the background but the hops are the star.
T - Wow, this is excellent. Balanced up front with a nice grainy sweetness and huge hop bitterness. Through the middle you are slammed with grapefruit and citrus. Finish is nicely balanced with more of the great hop flavor, some sticky sweetness and a hint of alcohol burn.
M - Mouthfeel is exactly what I want in a DIPA. Creamy through the middle with lively carbonation on the back end and the flavor lingers for just the right amount of time.
O - Overall, this is an excellent DIPA, even better than APW, and up there with Expo and Pliny. Another A+ for FFF. 961 charactersJanderson91, Aug 14, 2011
4.54/5  rDev +3.4%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Thank goodness for Kentucky being only 20 minutes away. I was fortunate enough to find several FFF bombers on sale at DEPs in Fort Thomas (for all you Greater Cincinnati area people)
Poured this into a white wine glass. It pours a lighter, golden, hazy color with a nice creamy white head. This is lighter in color than most IIPAs I have had recently. The head dissipated after a few minutes but left a nice ring around the edge of the beer with a nice swirl of white across the top.
Let me just say that I was catching whiffs of this as I was pouring it. It smells delicious. One of the better smelling beers I have found. Rich, sweet, tropical fruits, followed by a hint of piney resins. There are hints of the caramel malts in there as well. 
Hints of piney bitterness upfront, followed by tropical and citrus fruits (I see where they say peaches as well), along with the caramel malts in the middle that make you think its turning sweet. Instead of going sweet, it keeps bitters into the finish with a nice tinge of alcohol in the throat. I have to admit though, after about 5-6 sips, my taste buds are fading. Its not a ripper, but definitely has some bite to it.
Nice body for an IIPA. Medium with the right amount of carbonation.
This is mighty tasty and smells about as good as a beer can smell. If they could put this in fragrance form I would at minimum have it on a pine tree hanging from my rear view mirror. This is where its at... 1,449 charactersphiberoptik, Aug 14, 2011

This beer is absolutely amazing. Huge citrusy nose with a nice hefty yet mellow taste. Lots of mango and pineapple hops, with a very very subtle earthy undertone. Big creamy mouthfeel--almost like a cask pour.
Some DIPAs can go a little over board on the malt or spicy hops but this is very well balanced (for a hop bomb). It's been a while since I have had one of these but this bottle reminds me why I got into craft beer in the first place. 500 charactersKevBrews, Aug 12, 2011
3.98/5  rDev -9.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4I’ve been in the craft beer world too long without having a Dreadnaught. Every time I go on a beer run, it’s staring me in the face; however, because of the price and the lack of a bottle date, I’ve decided to pass. Until now! I know this bomber’s fresh, so I forked over the $12. I love me some Three Floyd’s, and this seems to be one of their most beloved brews. Can’t wait to take a sip…
A: One of the best looking DIPA’s I’ve seen in a while. It pours a rich, shining gold that sparkles at every turn, with a creamy white head. There’s so much lacing, too – it’s a web of sticky foam. Even the head retention is pretty good. Very nicely done.
S: Extreme hoppiness – I like it. Big pine scents are first, followed by a cavalcade of fruit: mango, grapefruit, lemon, and tangerine. The malts are definitely overshadowed, but you can still make out a clean sugariness with every sniff. It’s warm and sweet, like a candy syrup. Every scent is grounded in freshness, making this nose nothing but refreshing.
T: Nice balance for such a hop-centric brew! The first tastes I get are actually breads, fresh from the oven. The malts have to have their say first, because they know that they’ll soon be overtaken by hoppy bitterness. Pure sugar and leafy grains hit at the same time, but, as two different but tasty flavors will do, they contrast each other nicely. There’s no getting around it; the malt backing on this beer is huge. I’m not a big fan of super malt-bombs, which is why I’m glad there’s a whole lot of hops to distract me. The bitters come in quickly, but never really break the smoothness of the palate; a testament to the strength of the malts. The finish, then, instead of being overly dry, is more a tongue-smacking sweetness mixed in with only a hint of hoppy astringency. There are certainly a lot of flavors at work in this brew.
M: Bubbly, smooth, just the slightest bit crisp. This is a thick DIPA, which works to play up the maltiness of the palate. Like I said, I’m not a fan of super malty beers, so the feel doesn’t really cater to my interests. Still, it's an appropriate amount of carbonation and viscosity.
O: Not my favorite Three Floyd’s offering. It has good flavor, but I’ve had better DIPA’s for the money. Still, it will satisfy any malt lover’s sweet tooth, while also catering to hopheads everywhere. Good beer, great brewery, just not exactly my style. 2,441 charactersBarryMFBurton, Aug 12, 2011

A: apricot ale with less than single finger of egg whites. This dissipates quickly to a broken sheet of the same. Ring lace. Excellent clarity. 
S: biscuit malt, some citric hops. Hints of pine sol. Meh. 
T: soooo, this beer quite sweet. Like honey and biscuits. Hints of pine. Not much else. 
M: medium bodied and moderately hi carb. 
O: I'm gonna guess this is old, but hard to tell. Until I've had a confirmed fresh beer, I have to say this beer is average. 526 charactersharrymel, Aug 12, 2011
3.43/5  rDev -21.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3Poured into a Lost Abbey stem. 
Pours a slightly hazy light-orange with a nice slightly off-white head that sticks all over the glass. Looks impressive. The aroma is a combination of piney, grassy and fruity (grapefruit, orange) hops. Smells good. Slightly grapefruit hop bitterness gives way to an abundant soapy bitterness balanced with some a bit of malt. The middle to finish of this beer is a bit off-putting with the soapy flavor and harsh finishing bitterness. The mouthfeel is surprisingly light for the ABV and style with good carbonation. Overall I just don't get this beer. This is the second time I have had it and both times I don't think it works. The hop profile finishes fairly off-putting, though it seems close. I'll have to try this one at the brewery some time. 782 charactersseeswo, Aug 11, 2011
4.22/5  rDev -3.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5I brought this one to our IPA day party.
A - Pours slightly hazed golden yellow with a nice pillow of one finger tall white head leaving small beads of lace down the glass.
S - Smells of a mix of grassy and citric hops, tropical fruits; mostly grapefruit and pineapple; and some light sweetness from the lightly toasted caramel malt.
T - Starts off with a nice dose of grassy hops quickly giving way to a mix of even more citric hops, pineapple, grapefruit, and the ever present caramel malt. I am glad I drank this one when I did as it seems like the sweetness is growing quickly, swallowing up the juicy hops. The finish is a mix of hop bitterness and caramel sweetness, lingering for a short period of time.
M - Medium body and flavor with moderate carbonation. Slick, hoppy, feel with plenty of it lingering through the finish.
O - When fresh, this one is hard to beat. It is very well balanced and has plenty of hops for even the most fervent hop head. I hope to try this one on-tap someday and really give it a proper going over. 1,040 charactersorangesol, Aug 11, 2011

Aroma is mostly citrus and floral hops with some malt sweetness which is mostly a caramel aroma. 
Taste is sweet upfront balanced by a citrus and grassy bitterness. Very dry in the finish, but the hop flavor feels slightly faint.

The color is golden yellow with amber tinges similar to a golden peach, the cap is pale with rocky top and tight bead. The smell has a potent hop combo with faint pineapple blending with a slight floral and citrus combo. The intense aroma carries over into the feel with a good balance of hop bitterness and resins from the oily american hop with bitterness in the high range and a good amount of malt backing with moderate carbonation and dry alcoholic finish. 
 The taste is herbal and grassy up front with huge tangy tropical fruit flavor and mild grapefruity acidity with a slight pineapple and orange rind element. The grassy herbal taste returns with some slightly sweet malt and mellow alcohol in the semi-dry finish. Overall a pretty great beer, seems like a classic Imperial IPA flavor with moderate alcohol and plenty of bitterness, yet the aroma and flavoring hops are not neglected at all. This is well worth enjoying if you can get some fresh. 1,038 charactersSlatetank, Aug 06, 2011
4.45/5  rDev +1.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5I had shared a bomber of this fantastic IPA last month but I picked up a bomber a few weeks back on my trip to the brewery. This time I was able to enjoy the entire bomber by myself and I really wish that I bought several more! I poured the beer into my DFH snifter to find a dark hazy golden body with an one inch head that leaves a nice sticky lacing on the glass.
This is a fantastic smelling beer dominated with the citrus hops with hints of pineapple and tropical fruits, did I mention the citrus hops are just mouth-watering. This is one of those beers that the aroma hits you as soon as you crack the bottle open.
Amazing flavor, I wish I could drink this one everyday. The hops hit you hard first but quickly giveaway to all of the citrus and tropical notes. You get the caramel malt towards the back but it quickly gives way to the bitterness. A lot going on, but blended so well together.
Creamy texture, so smooth and balanced and easy to drink. The alcohol is very well hidden and you don't notice it at all. Overall just a fantastic beer and easily in my top five overall and my second favorite IPA. A Midwestern beer that is confused on what time zone it is in. 1,178 charactersDan3279, Aug 06, 2011

4.23/5  rDev -3.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 422oz bottle with no bottled on or freshness date, poured into Hair of the Dog tulip, reviewed on 7/27/11.
A: Pours a slightly hazy golden orange with dense off-white head that leaves some lacing around glass.
S: Aroma is dominated by fruity hops, pineapple, orange and mango come to mind with a fair amount of sweet malt in there as well, very little detectable alcohol.
T: Lots of hop bitterness up front with less hop flavor than in the nose. After the initial wave of bitterness comes a combination of grapefruit and pineapple hops with caramel malt. Finishes with a bitter aftertaste and lingering hop flavor. As it warms the strong initial bitterness fades a bit as the hop flavors and some malt sweetness come through much more. Definitely tasting quite a bit better once it warms up a bit from refrigerator temp.
M: Somewhat sticky and resinous medium body with moderate carbonation.
O: Good DIPA, I have a feeling that this may not be as fresh as can be but without a date on the bottle I can't be totally sure, it is still drinking really well none the less. 1,072 charactersAzurescens, Jul 28, 2011
4.47/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Bomber into a tulip.
Light in color and golden, two-finger head that sticks around and leaves nice lacing.
Smell is great--lots of tropical aromas, like mango, pineapple, grapefruit. Right out of the bottle, this is one of the best beer aromas I've smelled. As it warms, some sweeter malt and alcohol join in the mix.
Flavor is relatively balanced for the style, with smooth malt and fruity hop flavors running parallel. Great mango/grapefruit hop flavors. A bit sweet in the middle and finishes with a nice hop kick. Really an easy one to drink for the ABV, and the alcohol bite is minimal. 
Mouthfeel is medium and leaves a creamy texture on the mouth. Appropriate enough.
This is a great DIPA, and one of the best I've had. It's not quite the hop bomb I remember it being when I had it on tap at the brewery, but it's a perfect example of how to make a drinkable DIPA with both balance and great hop flavor. 915 charactersmusicforairports, Jul 27, 2011

Shared by my bro-in-law (godin64bit) while we did some work around my house. 
Light clear gold with a white head. Nice thick rings and globs of lacing. 
Smells of caramel malts and some pale dry malts as well. The hop bill is huge and lucious with giant grapefruit and oranges coming through. The flavor adds a little note of pineapple with some resiny pine on the dry bitter finish. 
Medium body with plenty of carbonation and a great lingering bitter dryness. 
Man I love this beer. FFF is my favorite brewery for many reasons, and dreadnaught is certainly a big plus in their corner. 619 charactersAleWatcher, Jul 26, 2011

Intoxicating scent of grapefruit, pineapple, mango, pine, flowers, peach with a fruity and grahmn cracker sweetness, touch of vanilla and hints of alcohol. Taste follows scent, first suprise was lack of overwhelming palate scorching bitterness which was a good thing in this case. Fruity sweet with decent grahmn crackery malt backbone.

4.53/5  rDev +3.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Dreadnaught IPA, Three Floyds, 9.5% abv
A: It has a bright cloudy tangerine and orange haziness to it, lots of foam with huge carbonation. The lacing is thin but the whole presentation is great.
S: It reeks of huge grapefruit and tangelo notes, some mild orange rind dryness, and almost zero herbal aspects to it.
T: The taste almost directly mirrors the smell, which is surprisingly rare in IPAs this big and complex. It has that great juiciness of Sculpin, orange notes, a strange tartness similar to grapefruit or unripe tangerines. This is incredibly refreshing and the abv sneaks in like a Trojan horse.
M: The mouthfeel is a bit bigger than the standard DIPA but it doesn’t toe into that disappointing maharaja range with excessive coating and chewing. This beer has an exceptional balance. A strange note that needs commenting upon is how good the bubbles feel. They somehow hit an exceptional attenuation/carbonation level. Three Floyds consistently delivers exceptional products and this one delivers.
D: This is clearly exceptionally drinkable but the lack of availability, price point, and high-ish abv seems to draw away from the universal applicability of this beer. It is a world class but it as far as the epic DIPA class goes it is certainly not best in show. Overall, a great beer and the Midwest has a viable answer to the west coast giants.
Narratives: Shire Grassmuggins was not an exceptional piece of feudalism. It got exceptional amounts of rain and had incredible turnip yields, given the time and labor constrictions. Serfdom never exactly produced the most diligent workers, but, as far as 13th century economies went, Grassmuggins was a solid performer in a bull market. The workers were diligent and took religious holidays often, but the field was almost conscious of its need for crop rotation. The crude tools yielded amazing produce but the soil called out for minor improvements. The wind through the reeds seemed to scream to the peasants for basic nitrates through fertilization. Alas, this shire must let its latent glory remain unknown to other regions. 2,098 charactersSubpoenaDeuces, Jul 22, 2011

pours a cloudy, deep maple/honey color. excellent head, ditto the lacing in the glass.
nose - nice bready aroma. hops are understated - some pine, some citrus a little pepper, a good balance is struck. taste is a bit inverse from the nose - very hop-forward. any concerns about the malt being too much are quickly dissapated.
mouthfeel is super - full on the palate, and yet slick enough it begs for more drinks.

4.3/5  rDev -2.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A: Golden amber hue, sweet translucent magnificence in my Great Lakes British pint glass. Nice bubbly thick white head leaves good lacing across the sides of the glass. like a protein stain on a fresh pair of silk boxers (you can't wear those again). Quarter inch head lingers through tasting. Beer pours and looks like a summer sunset.
S: Wow, grapefruit rocks the nose. Its friends mango, allspice, and pine resin kick in the door and launder my socks for good measure. This brew smells sweet, citrusy, and complex. Can't wait.
T: The rapacious citrus notes overwhelm the palate, melding into a soft bouquet of grapefruit and pine. The malts stand up nicely to the overwhelming hops with the calming presence of a shirtless uncle at the end of a family picnic. This beer is absolutely righteous....easily one of the top 5 DIPAs I have tasted. 
M: Very well balanced. Surprisingly smooth for such a strong hop presence, like the skin on the nape of Russell Crowe's neck. Leaves a lingering, cloying pine feel on the mid palate. Carbonation is perfect.
O: Dreadnaught IPA is worth every bit of the hype, like the 5th time you watch "Grandma's Boy". It has an assertive hop presence which is balanced perfectly by the flavorful malts. The beer looks, smells, and tastes beautifully. An outstanding achievement. 1,313 characterssiege06nd, Jul 20, 2011

S: Mangos and more mangos. Very strong citrus aroma, not much beyond that that I can really discern, it's so powerful. A little pine resin behind it but not much.
T: Mango as expected from the aroma. There is a strong pine bitterness hiding in there now. A bit of caramel helps round it out. As it warms up the peach really starts to show itself. Yum!
M: Pretty mid-level mouthfeel. Quite drying on the aftertaste.
O: Good hop-forward DIPA. A "must" if you are a mango fan, this one is saturated with the smell and flavor. 637 charactersDope, Jul 18, 2011

A - A nice bright cloudy apricot color with a thick white head which dissipated quickly. A nice thin lacing wraps as the glass empties.
S - Immediately got a huge scent of sweet mangos. The smell continued throughout and it absolutely wonderful.
T - Again mangos... followed by a wonderful hoppy bitter deliciousness. Aftertaste sticks with the sweet fruit taste. The deeper you go into this beer it seems to lose more of the fruit taste and revert back into a bitter hoppiness. Wonderful complexity.
M - I would have expected this to be an overly thick beer but not so. More of a medium mouth feel. You can definitely feel the bitterness on every taste.
O - Simply put amazing. I've tried a lot of the big boy DIPAs out there and this is definitely one of my top 3 favorites. My best description for this would be a great cross of Maharaja fruitiness with the great overall characteristics of Pliny. 957 charactersjmpizzo, Jul 16, 2011

Color is that of a dark tangerine, head is white. It's dark in FFF, and this is what i see.
The aroma has some notes of pine like a west coast IPA, and grapefruit with a juicy tropical nose that is appealing, asks you to bite it, but you know better. 
This one being very fresh has alot of bitterness to it, 100ibus, and alot of that bitterness comes from or is tied to the notes of grapefruit, a great example of that note i think. there is other citrus AKA tangerine and orange, some tropical notes though a bit more subtle then the nose, and a hint of pine for the west coast influence. 685 charactersChadQuest, Jul 15, 2011

He’s heard the rumors of amber colored brew with an amazing balance of piney hops and malt. Three Floyds came thorough for our Northwest brethren with this Imperial IPA masterpiece. The nose is duped by the overwhelming aroma of hops. The palate also never identifies the high alcohol content of this bad boy. This is due to the fact that the initial blast of pine, citrus, and hops is quickly counteracted by a rush of malt. A perfectly balanced Imperial IPA, Deadnaught just up the ante for the rest of the field... 572 charactersdboon, Jul 13, 2011

The pour is blood orange with plenty of yellow highlights. A gorgeous two-finger head forms and lasts, leaving sticky lacing all around the glass. Very nice.
I could smell this one as soon as I opened the bottle. Tons of grapefruit, lemon zest, and pineapple. It almost smells like dried fruit, rich with candy and natural sugars. The citric hop profile is excellent. Not a hint of booze. 
Taste is very good, if not quite equal to the smell. Sweet citrus fruits, with pervasive, throat-coating bitterness. I’m fortunate to be able to review a fresh bottle, as the hops are still very strong here. That said, the bitterness almost takes away from the underlying fruit flavors.
Mouthfeel is very well done: light, bubbly and smooth. This goes down as easily as any IPA, and it’s pretty remarkable that it pushes 10%. I’m not sure there’s a commercially-available East Coast DIPA that rivals this. 952 charactersamphion1065, Jul 09, 2011
4.42/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Found a bottle of this in Bethlehem PA back in early January of 2009, It must have been one of the last 3 Floyd's shipped to this state because after having that bottle I wasn't able to ever find more here again. Without much knowledge of this beer I managed to get the bottle and give it good home for a little while. Eventually I opened it up and poured it for myself. This brew looked really nice, had a bright yellowish color with a light amount of haze to it. The head was creamy and thick looking, leaving a real nice lacing on the glass. The smell of this beer had a wonderful mix of tropical fruit aromas like Pineapple, Grapefruit and Lemons. The taste was also had the same flavors as it did on the nose plus the excellent addition of Pine. This beer was very refreshing. The mouthfeel was medium bodied and had some good carbonation to it. Overall I think that this is the IPA that changed my perception on this style. I hadn't really been a big fan of them till I had this one. This beer is great, I wanted to buy more when I was at the brewery back in April but they were sold out. Better luck next time I guess. 1,125 charactersKnapp85, Jul 08, 2011
4.41/5  rDev +0.5%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a bomber into a shaker pint glass.
A: Slightly hazy, brassy golden color with two fingers of lofty and persistent white foam head. Moderate lacing remains on the glass, and a few solitary bubbles rise lazily in the column.
S: Initially intense and appealing, with hop aromas consisting of grapefruit citrus, pine, and tropical fruit all showing up. Intensity lacks much longevity unfortunately, with fruit turning increasingly vinous alongside understated toasted malt later. No alcohol is detected.
T: Begins off-dry, with floral and citrus hop aromatics accented by bright citric acidity. Balance, DIPA-style, is achieved through the presence of toasty "cookie" malt. Flavors turn estery in the middle, as hop flavors begin to decline, with a whiff of spirituous fumes underlining the decidedly-ale flavors. This beer finishes in classic and memorable form, with bracing bitterness and a taste of grapefruit peel that lingers long on the palate.
M: Medium viscosity, resinous and slightly acidic on the palate, with moderate carbonation.
D/O: A remarkable Midwestern DIPA that comes close to doing everything right. At first taste flavors seem outdistanced by the smell, but they are able to overtake the inconsistent nose by the end. There is not much else to criticize, leaving this beer to stand up comparably to its West Coast peers. 1,356 charactersbeagle75, Jul 08, 2011

A-- Poured a slightly hazy but almost clear amber orange. Bright white head that was a half a finger and went to film. Good head retention though. Good lacing and good alcohol legs to this. Little carbonation shown with this. Looks good. 
S-- Good nose. Bright, vibrant citrus, whith just hints of malt. Candied orange, candied pineapple, mango and papaya. Mouthwatering smell to this. 
T-- Not as big and aggressive as West Coast DIPA's are but good. Mouth gets tangerine, orange, grapefruit and a bit of lime. Malt is minimal at best. No alcohol taste at all. 
M-- Medium bodied and closer to medium high carbonation. Lots of bitter grapefruit and bitter orange peel in the back and finish. Very clean finish in the back. Very creamy in the front. 
O-- Impressive, very impressive. On par with the best Western US DIPA's and to me the best of the Midwest. Easy to drink, well hidden ABV, and just tasty. 959 charactersmulder1010, Jul 05, 2011
4.1/5  rDev -6.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Thanks to TMoney2591 for this one!
Clear orangey, quasi-clear amber with a massive white frothy head with mondo sticky lace. The smell is mostly the citrus end of American hop profiles with some pine and a barely discernible malt backdrop. I'm enjoying the citrus right now as it draws my nose into the foam. Yum! The malts do a better job of balancing the hops on the tongue adding something between "biscuit" and "caramel". Anybody, please let me know a better way to describe that. I did not detect any of the diacetyls that the Brother Jason did, so it may have been an anomaly in the batch he drank...or I did a poor job of tasting. I hope for the former. The hops take control back in the aftertaste by throwing off tons of pine resin and burying the malts into oblivion. The initial hop profile was some sweet grapefruit with pine, but the pine takes control eventually, as it usually does...much to my dismay. 
Indiana has made themselves a West Coast IPA and done so admirably. Now I know how Hoosiers wash down that crap they call "pizza". Come to NYC area and we'll show you what pizza should be, but in the meantime I'll enjoy your beer as NJ has no IPA that can represent as well as this. 1,203 charactersNaugros, Jul 02, 2011

The color of this IPA is a beautiful coppery orange with a nice finger head of foam riding the top.
The smells that come to my nose out of this one is a brilliant citrus orange peel smell with some mango mixed in to give a fresh fruity smell that too me is one of the best smelling brews I have ever had.
The taste of this one was not anything special to me the first time I tried it. I actually thought it was not really anything spectacular at all before which leads me to believe the bottle I had was way old. The tastes I'm getting in my mouth now is a huge rush of that citrus orange flavor with a pronounced hop bite, and some more fruitiness that mixes with a twinge of alcohol. The balance between the fruit and hop bitterness in this beer is incredible.
The mouthfeel was a very crisp refreshing feel to me and it left my mouth with a slight dry feeling that I rather enjoyed.
One of my new favorite beers, I can't believe I didn't like this one at first. Now I can't leave the brew pub without one. 1,097 charactersIchabodcraneIpa, Jun 30, 2011

Great color, dark straw to orange, the last half of the bottle poured was pretty murky but taste did not alter.
S- Amazing, really hoppy and citrusy and this bottle was at least 6 weeks old.
T- Fantastic!. I have never been a huge fan of FFF as typically their beers aren't up my alley. Especially since I'm not a fan of DIPA's, but this one was extremely tasty, the best offering I have had from them.

Poured from 22oz Bottle
A- Pours a great looking amber color with a 2 finger white head. Head recedes down to only a cm or two which remains for the rest of the ride. Great lacing throughout.
S- Downright incredible. First thing that hits the nostrils is the great smell of hops. Loads of citrus and piney hops with hints of malt and sweet fruit lingering in the background
T- Massively complex. Starts with a blast of hops up front; a mix of grapefruit, orange, and mango lead the way and bleed into a bitter pine taste. Just when the bitterness seems like it is going to overwhelm, a solid malt backbone kicks in to balance everything out. Lingering bitterness on the lips and back of tongue as drinking progresses.
M- Perfect. Crisp and refreshing. Find this very drinkable considering the ABV
O- A defining brew from FFF. Hop forward but undertones of sweet fruit and a malt backbone keep this balanced and complex. This will take your taste buds for a ride. Definitely a top-tier DIPA 1,009 charactersSimmy7000, Jun 27, 2011
4.18/5  rDev -4.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.522oz bottle, unknown date. Served at around 45-50F.
Pours lightly hazy burnt gold with a three finger foamy white head that leaves a couple of rings of foamy lace and holds a small cap.
Aroma is peaches, grapefruit citrus, some pineapple and mango along with good grassy and herbal notes. Some mild malt peeks through but the hops are the star here. Good to very good strength.
Flavor is tropical fruits of pineapple and mango, some lemon and grapefruit citrus rind, peach and apricot, giving way to some caramel and bready malt that offers a touch of sweetness which is then swept away by a wave of hop bitterness. Some alcohol is noted but isn’t solvent or biting.
Mouthfeel is medium bodied, oily and slick, low-medium carbonation.
A superb DIPA, very tasty and a huge want for a long time. Thrilled to have the chance to finally try this. However, I have to throw in the obligatory ranking amongst top-tier DIPAs, and for me, this is very good but not the best I’ve had. Doesn’t crack my Top 5, but probably within my Top 10. 1,040 characterselgiacomo, Jun 27, 2011

4.17/5  rDev -5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 422 oz. bottle obtained at the FFF brewery and consumed just a few days later. Poured into a tulip.
Appearance: Pours a slightly turbid orange-tinted amber that looked identical to the honey that I used on my pancakes this morning. Hmmm, let me check something...Hunter's Honey Farm, Martinsville, IN. Coincidence? OK, probably. Accompanied with a nice thick cream-like head that refused to go silently into this 89 degree night. Hurry up damn you, I'm thirsty here! 
Smell: Best described as the fragrance that the perfect woman would wear on a first date. Blast of citrus, grapefruit, lemon, and pine accompanied by hints of malt and honey. Hah, I knew that something was up with that honey. The aroma loses none of its potency as I just keep on taking in the fumes rising from this bad boy. Seriously, the perfect pheromone for you women out there. 
Taste: OK, having finally been able to tear my nose away from my tulip glass, I’d have to say I’m a little disappointed with the taste. Perhaps I’ve overhyped this one just a tad based on smell alone. The taste mirrors the nose for the most part, except that I was expecting a tad more citra in the flavor profile. Allowing this one to warm up a bit solidified the balance between the hops and maltiness. But, regrettably, I was still left waiting and pondering what could have been if that citra had made an appearance to this party.
Mouthfeel: I'd probably describe it as medium-bodied, but it was a bit thinner than I expected it to be given the flavors detected in the aroma. Carbonation was perfect though, something FFF has mastered in my opinion. Surprisingly, however, I did get a little bit of a warming sensation from the alcohol in the back of the throat. Slight hoppy bitterness as well, but in a very good way. 
Overall: An excellent DIPA if I must say. Definitely something that everyone needs to try once, particularly those hopheads out there. FFF without doubt dedicated this one to the almighty hops that’s for damn sure. But do I dare be so bold as to mention it in the same breath as Hopslam or PtE? Nope. 2,090 charactersleschkie, Jun 21, 2011

4.15/5  rDev -5.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 2 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5A - very bright orange yellow. This pours with a fantastic two finger white head that has a cute little assortment of bubbles. The retention isn't bad; it layers down to a few millimeters of white film with splotchy lacing.
S - There's a serious burst of fresh citrus and a little bit of nutty caramel malt action going on, then a ton of alcohol aroma comes out of nowhere and overshadows everything,.
T - That smell is a triflin' son of a bitch! That gross alcoholic finish in the smell is nowhere to be found in the taste. This is a goddamn cornocopia of citrus; fresh orange, light lemon and grapefruit bitter, mango, papaya. Light grass and pine come after the fresh citrus and helps introduce me to a small, but delicious malt character which gives a nice amount of caramel sweetness and nutty bread. This is absurdly easy to drink.
M - Medium bodied which sticks to the mouth a bit with a subtle level of carbonation. 
O - This is a beer that I'm always thankful to be able to get (albeit sporadically). Other than the semi offputting smell, this beer is wonderful and terribly drinkable (watch out). 1,110 charactersdrewba, Jun 17, 2011
4.32/5  rDev -1.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4A- Light hazy cloudy orange with a great white head and excellent lacing. Head sits around for a minute or two.
S- Hops. Major oily sticky hops. As fresh as hops can smell in the palm of your hand. Faint citrus notes. But the piney hops is the awesomeness here.
T- Extremely well balanced brew here. Hops isn't quite as strong as the nose would suggest, but they are still in your face. But a superb balance as well with a great malty backbone of malts. A touch of bread. And kisses of orange peel and grapefruit.
M- Good lower carbonation. Creamy mouthfeel with a bit of an oily stickyness. Wet at the start with a refreshing dry finish from a bit of the bittering hops that makes for a great mouthfeel on this one.
O- One of the best DIPA's around. The balance is what makes this beer so great. Truly. 807 charactersBierlerner, Jun 16, 2011
3.95/5  rDev -10%look: 3 | smell: 3 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4On tap into a snifter
A: Pours a clear copper color with a fizzy, white head.
S: Smells notoriously hoppy without much else. It’s not punch you in the face hoppy like Double Bastard Ale, but it’s hoppy enough that the subtle citrus aromas struggle to penetrate.
T/M: Tastes predominantly hoppy as well, again not like someone-just-mugged-you-in-the-street-and-rubbed-hops-in-your-face-for-humiliation hoppy, but still hoppy enough that it’s the predominant flavor. It has medium carbonation and some lingering bitterness in there, typical of an IPA, but it’s surprisingly lighter than you might expect.
It’s extremely well balanced and, honestly, that’s really all you can ask for. When you want an IPA but don’t want to drown in the hoppiness, this one is perfect. 783 charactersTheBeerAlmanac, Jun 16, 2011

T - Taste of sweet mango and orange up front with ncie malty flavor in the middle; subdued bitter flavor the back end; really nicely balanced
O - Much better than I remmeber when I first had this at the Maproom in Chicago. A really good DIPA that is well balanced, nice hopflavor countered by citurs sweetness and malt. Reminds me a little of DFH 90 minute IPA 585 charactersdwaz, Jun 16, 2011
4.22/5  rDev -3.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.522oz bottle into a Killian's pint
A- Pours a golden straw-yellow with a pillowy 2 finger off-white head that leaves huge amounts of lacing. Lots of carbonation off the bottom of the glass.
S- Big hit of sweet citrus notes, sugary orange, grapefruit. Slight amount of resiny hop notes. Sweet malt with a little bit of a biscuit-like aroma. Alcohol present as well.
T- Blast of bitter hops mixed with nice mellow sweetness from the malt. Citrus grapefruit and orange notes along with some more tropical fruits as well.
M- Medium-light bodied with excellent carbonation that helps lead to a dry finish that moves everything along.
O- I've had this a few times, but never sat down to review it. This is a fantastic DIPA and I'm happy I live close enough to FFF to call this my go-to for the style. 798 charactersstxSS07, Jun 15, 2011
4.6/5  rDev +4.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Had many times, never reviewed. I have a little extra time and a patient mood, so I figured I'd finally chime in.
A glorious appearance, mostly translucent golden body and a frothy, sticky cream colored head. Well carbonated as there are plenty of bubbles flickering around.
An amazing aroma, so damn floral and citrusy, like it was dry hopped for decades.
The flavor is a surprisingly even balance between its golden caramel malts, earthy hop content really kicks in with the finish. Comes off very fruity and a little sweet, even.
The mouthfeel is exactly as expected from the amount of carbonation seen, bubbly and the body is heavy without being overbearing.
Probably the most balanced IPA I've ever had. It may not have the malt awesomeness of a 90 Minute, or the sweet hop slap of a Hopslam, but the slightly subdued characteristics of each really meld into a delicious, even, pleasure of a drink. 908 characterscnally, Jun 11, 2011
4.34/5  rDev -1.1%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4.5Big thanks to aasher for helping me get my hands on this one.
A: Dreadnaught pours an almost copper hue and sits lazily in the glass. Even with laser etching, and a good swirl, this brew can't seem to muster up any lacing. I'll forgive the mediocre head retention, due to the ABV, and the haze, due to the IBUs, but it should have something going on. It just seems kind of lifeless =o\
S: What was dead to the eye is a fountain of energy to the nose, which is greeted with an onslaught of bitter citrus in the form of grapefruit, pine, mango, and rosemary. 
T: Very dry, given the abv, with a definite emphasis on hops. Bitter resins in the front, a brief intermission of honey sweetness in the middle, and a lingering expression of tropical fruits and woody herbs.
M: Light body, low carbonation, significant astringency, and fairly clean finish.
O: Definitely a kick-ass IIPA. It is a shame that this may be one of only a handful of times I will taste this brew, due to FFF's philosophy on distribution. Be that as it may, this is a superb brew that deserves every bit of the recognition it receives. 1,107 charactersAvagadro, Jun 09, 2011
4.46/5  rDev +1.6%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.522 oz chug into a snifter...so glad I'm doing some work in Hammond, IN, it makes the top-tier stuff from 3Fs easy to come by (it's always sold out in Chicago--try finding a bottle of Dreadnaught for sale anywhere, or for that matter, sixers of their regular stuff most the time). 
Appearance is actually flawless. Bright body with a billowy head that rises to the top of the snifter perfectly. I like having this glass that can take the whole bottle if you're not sharing with a friend. 
I'm only giving a 4 on aroma because the hop profile resembles a supped up version of the hop profile that you find in varying levels in many 3Fs beer...even if the hop profile that we know and love is one of the best in the nation, they could switch it up more, not just intensify it...small complaint in the scope of this beer's excellence.
Taste is pretty incredible and quite complex. There is a ton of malt to the backside of this hop-forward beer. Incredible hop profile on the tongue, with notes of pine and fruit. It really shines, dances even. A winner, a champion, one of the best big IPAs ever. I am smacking my lips as I write this. You can't even taste the high alcohol. But you sure can taste the hops.
Mouthfeel is flawless. Most 3Fs beers are close to perfect in terms of mouthfeel, but Dreadnaught is actually and literally perfect and could not be improved in this regard. Clean, crisp, direct. 
Highly recommended. Big IPAs from the Midwest are rarely respected, but this is one of the elite big Midwest IPAs that can give any West Coast breweries offering's a run for their money. 1,593 characterschicagoabbot, Jun 08, 2011

Wow, a totally unforgettable dank beer...
A: Nothing too exciting here, straw yellow, nice small head. Looks pretty but unspectacular.
S: Tropical mango and peach, apples, honey, citrus. Smell delicious.
T: Wow. this tastes like a hoppy rendition of champagne. It is utterly quaffable, delicate, effervescent, gentle, but then a great big dry hoppy force-field enters the picture and hangs onto your palette while being tickled with gentle tropical flavors. I think this is a really special beer. 
M: Smooth and slick, bubbly and gentle. Very light feeling for the high APV.

A- Unbelievable Golden Honey color! Cloudy with great carbonation! Beautiful fluffy white head that slowly drips away leaving sticky lacing all over the glass! Damn close to perfect!!!
S- Sweet grapefruit, orange and lemon peel, fresh cut grass, compost, over-ripe pineapple, and dried peaches. So much going on here... keeps changing as it warms up a bit. 
T- WOW! Tart and sweet grapefruit, mango, bitter orange peel! Fresh cut pine tree, grass, and a touch of compost on the backend. Hints of a malty backbone, but mostly bitter and in your face! Really punches your tastebuds! 
M- Just wakes your mouth up with a blast of bitter citrus and pine! The sweetness of the malt creeps up, but it's having a hard time fighting the citrus pop! If your mouth is having a dull day... have a sip or ten of this one! 
O- Unreal!!! I wish I could drink this a few times a week! I'm pretty sure this is the polar opposite of Dark Lord!

4.37/5  rDev -0.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5From the bottle to my glass, to my mouth, could life be better, I think not. Good foam action, generating a two finger head of thick, slightly off white foam, that I could take a nap, well almost. Far from clear, it most closely resembles a 8 on the SRM beer color chart. Smell, ooo la la, aromas of flowers from the hops, sweet nectars, but mostly grapefruit, lemon and other citrus flavors from the massive use of hops. Taste is lots of what I like. Flavors of grapefruit, pine, lemon peel, and lime are in the forefront, with a sweetness from hints of malt, orange, and guava. Mouthfeel is creamy, thick and zing. A slight dryness on the sides of my tongue and soft palate. I would like some more of this...please. 717 charactersbeerprovedwright, Jun 06, 2011
3.68/5  rDev -16.2%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Thanks to iadler for the generous surprise box.
Pours a straw-like yellow that is fairly easy to see throw. Atop is a billowing 2 finger head after an aggressive pour. Head sticks around for quite some time and leaves thick laving.
Smell is of pine, citrus, orange peel, tropical fruits, and hops. 
Taste is very nice with the citrus and tropical fruits up front. The hops follow up the fruitiness then comes the nice dry, piney finish. 
Mouthfeel is incredible. Possibly the smoothest DIPA I've yet to try. Fairly light bodied which I usually don't like for the style, but at this time of year its great. Crazy drinkability. 
A solid offering from FFF. I look forward to trying more.
Thanks again Isaac! 710 charactersDearthVader, Jun 06, 2011
4.05/5  rDev -7.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Dreadnaught on tap at a certain bar in Midtown Manhattan, eight ounces for $4 (happy hour). I never thought I'd live to see Three Floyds pouring in New York City.
Appearance: Dreadnaught shows up with one perfect finger of very white, Belgian-like head, along with great retention and lacing. Color is clear yellow, fresh straw. Heartland wheat fields in a sunny summer.
Smell: Grassy, fresh, tropical. A tad of malt vinegar and pungency. Roses, flower aroma. Very fragrant and persistent. Some urine on the back.
Taste: More tropics, pineapple syrup, mango. Would love to make a reduction sauce with this! Vinegar feel again, as in the nose. Sort of chardonnay-ish: bright, acidic and vinous. Maybe a mimosa, orange juice and bubbly or white wine. Bubblegum. Acrid, bitter hops at the end (throat-scratching hops!)
Mouthfeel: Resiny, oily. Like drinking high-quality olive oil for breakfast. Full body, flavor and carbonation. Stingy, prickly finish that lingers.
Overall: Very fragrant, aromatic, West Coast style. Drinkable at the eight-ounce mark, but not a whole pint, as the booze does make an appearance. Good DIPA, glad I got in NYC, but not one to go uber-crazy for and over. 1,189 charactersDoubleSimcoe, Jun 06, 2011

A: Pours a light shade of golden yellow with a frothy white head on top that formed that "pancake batter" bubbles in the middle that I like.
S: Wow. Huge nose of citrus, mango, and a hint of grapefruit. Pungent, potent, delightful hops dominate the nose.
T: And at the first taste, this beer does not disappoint, but rather lives up to it's lofty reputation. What is most surprising is just how "light" this beer is, it's not at all thick or heavy.
The hops dominate here. The malts stay waaay way out of the way. And the hops here are artistically rendered. It starts with citrus notes and perhaps some flavors of mango. I even pick up on a hint of Lemon. Then grapefruit and dry-hopped bitterness ride in like a wave to carry this beer to a finish line. Just exceptional.
M: Light and bubbly, this beer finishes with a good tongue-coating of hop oils.
D: Incredibly high. This beer sings my favorite song: hops. It's light, smooth, and full of hoppy flavor. Highly repeatable. 1,140 characterspsuKinger, Jun 05, 2011

Pours a honey amber color with a tiny half inch of white head. Leaves nice lacing down the glass.
Smells like resiny pine hops, citrus hops, caramel and a tinge of alcohol.
Tastes follows smell. Opens with the hops as well as caramel and moves into the citrus taste. Moves into an alcohol and pine finish and very clean.
Mouthfeel is full and nicely carbonated. 
overall it's a good beer...not the best. A little too sweet as it goes along and the alcohol becomes a bit too much. 524 charactersbs870621345, Jun 04, 2011

A: Beautiful orange but on this one. Light amount of head on top leaving some great lacing. 
S: I can smell the citrusy hops as I pour this. Sort of lemony with some good malt character in there. I'd describe the malt as being a little cerealy. Maybe some biscuit but not much. 
T: Freakin' amazing. This is what an IPA is meant to be. The hops come through more of a citrus orange then lemon and the bitter lingers on the backend. Up front is that sweet malt. It's amazing just how long the hop stays with you. This is certainly one you can sip and enjoy for awhile. Makes it well worth that $11.99 price tag. 
M: It feels "bright" in your mouth. From the moment you drink it until well after your done your taste buds will tingle. It's exactly what you want with an IPA. 
O: A+ hands down. One of the best if not the best IPA I've ever had. If you're a lover of IPA's and haven't had this you're doing yourself a disservice. 1,031 charactersBrewIndy, Jun 03, 2011
4/5  rDev -8.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Pours a light translucent orange with a smallish white head that leaves behind some substantial spotty lacing.
Aromas are a full on barrage of fruits; mainly tropical with mango and pineapple, but still substantial amounts of blood orange and grapefruit as well. Sweet honey and slight caramel maltiness on the back end as it warms a little. A little alcohol as it warms as well, which is unfortunate.
The taste begins with slight sweet and bready malts but quickly shifts to a barrage of lemon, grapefuit and pine bitterness and flavor from the hops. No tropical fruits that were in the aroma but the pine and citrus and delicious enough to carry the flavor profile. Slight crackery, dry bready maltiness and alcohol emerge as this warms a little. Quite resiny and sticky but not palate wrecking compared to many of today's DIPAs.
The mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium to low carbonation, a tad bit dry, and finishes quite crisp and a bit still resiny. I wish the light fusel alcohol wasn't impacting the overall flavor profile.
Overall this is a super solid DIPA, but not worth the inflated price tag coupled with the elevated hype surrounding this beer/brewery. I recommend it if you can find it but don't pay an arm and a leg to find it. Odds are the best DIPA available to you is on par with this brew, e.g. Hopslam, Pliny, DFH 90 Minute, Surly Abrasive, etc. 1,373 charactersclaspada, Jun 02, 2011
3.88/5  rDev -11.6%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Found at Lovejoys in Austin, TX this IPA shows a deep, clear copper color with a decent off-white colored head and very good lacing. The aroma offers a faint citrus biscuit/oak. Pleasant but not very distinct. The flavor brings an immediate citrus hop burst with lemon-lime bite and sweet leafy-grass edges, almost a bit nutty. It’s a medium bodied brew with minimal carbonation for a near glassy feel. Plenty drinkable and a tasty IPA that’s easy to recommend for those seeking a bitter treat. 498 charactersDurge, Jun 02, 2011
4.15/5  rDev -5.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a golden yellow with a medium white head that laces nicely.
Smells strongly of fruit, more tropical fruit, almost strawberry in the hop nose. Nice aroma but not amazing.
Tastes of fruity hops with a mix of mango and strawberry as the most up-front flavors for me. Some mix of pine and citra-type hops really work well here. There is some malt back, but it only really shows in the overall sweetness. Some bitterness towards the finish.
The has a nice, medium bodied mouthfeel that is not too heavy. It is smooth, and almost creamy but not quite.
This would be in my top three of the style. It is more towards the fruit/citra/amarillo side of things in taste, more smooth than bitter, and goes down well. I would like something more in the nose...though, I would bet if this was really fresh it would be amazing. 821 charactersTenHornsProud, May 28, 2011

Excellent aroma. How many hop words can one use to describe? Citrus, tropical, floral, grassy, pine, grapefruit, mango. Basically in that order. Oh, and a little caramel malt following. 
Very delicious flavor. Basically, a repeat of the rich aroma profile as the flavors blend nicely. On the sweeter side of the DIPA spectrum.
Medium mouthfeel with oily hops abounding. Although I generally prefer DIPAs with a little less sweetness, this one does not offend with its sweetness due to the deep hop profile. Highly recommend. 724 charactersFanofHefe, May 26, 2011

Pours golden with pure white foam, lots of nice super tiny bubbles and some but not much lacing. Smells like fresh mango and citrus, lemon, balanced with some caramel in the secondary. Taste leans more towards the citrus than tropical fruit, with a fair amount of caramely malt. The flavors are fairly muted, and I can't tell if this is just a freshness issue (bottle is from a trade). Long finish with a fair amount of piney bitterness. Medium bodied, medium-high carbonation, and no noticeable heat. Overall, very tasty, citrus-forward DIPA. 557 characterspmarlowe, May 25, 2011

Weird, because I poured two glasses. The first had a tiny head, the seconds head was about an inch deep. TONS of citrus on the nose. Tastes of grapefruit, orange, lemon, mango, and then more grapefruit through the finish that lingers through the aftertaste. Very very nice. Reminds me of alpha king without the bitterness. This stays sweet, hoppy, and fruity with very little bitterness. Very nice brew. So glad that I can find it year round "back home again in Indiana". 561 characters1Adam12, May 25, 2011

A- looks about a lighter golden haze from the bottle. Looks hazy and pale gold with some smaller carbonation bubbles. Larger 2 finger head that is staying around and will not go away. Very large head retention and lacing on this one.
S- BIIIIG citrus note. Grapefruit, orange and sweeter fruits like mango in there. smells really really good. 
T- I wish there was a freshness date on this but it tastes great nonetheless. I'm more of an unbalanced IPA guy but find this balance very satisfying. Big and wet upfront with an awesome balace of sweetness and bitterness. The malt is there but takes a backseat. Very nicely made beer. sweetness gets very strong toward the middle and turns piney bitter on the finish. Fantastic beer.
M- medium body with medium lighter carbonation. Feels wet and stays on the pallet for a while

A: A nice clear amber orange color with a thin head. Spotty minimal glass lacing that disappears. Carbonation is very low.
S: Great DIPA smell. Hops with citrus, grapefruit and pine with a sweet malt smell. Balanced.
T: Follow the nose. I actually got a sweet malt hit first, then the hops come rushing in with flavors of citrus, grapefruit, orange, pine and some spice. The sweet caramel malt stays while the hops punch you in the face. Big bitterness that is prickly on the finish lasts. Alcohol pokes through at the end. Hoppy but malty too, great balance.
M: Full and prickly, very thick too. Fairly prominent alcohol flavor but it is very welcomed and warming. Low carbonation.
D: Medium, this was a very enjoyable beer, but I'm not sure I could have anymore. Very enjoyable in smaller quantities. 
Overall a top notch DIPA no doubt that can stand up to the best. Very west coast style and very good. Glad I got to finally try this revered beer, it was very good.
*** Updated 5/20/11***
Traded for another bottle recently from fear025. Thanks Jay.
On my second tasting I am picking up a ton more fresh sweet fruit. Mango, grapefruit, orange, peach etc. with some slight pineyness. Freshness is key with this beer (of course). Less malt comes through but remains strong with huge caramel flavors. Finish lasts but alcohol is very well hidden. I thoroughly enjoyed this beer the second time around. Drinkabiltiy was awesome and I could have easily had more. Great, great DIPA. 1,579 charactersKadonny, May 23, 2011

T- Great amount of citrus and pine notes with grapefruit as well as pineapple and mango. There is a slight sharp bitterness and sweet malt in the finish. 
M- Medium carbonation. Chewy and slightly oily mouthfeel. Despite the high ABV, it is still quite drinkable.

4.95/5  rDev +12.8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Before we begin, I should mention that I've had this both on tap and in bomber format, and the only perceptible difference for me is that the bomber has somewhat less of the tropical hops and more of the piney hops aroma, as well as a wonderfully creepy label art. This review is otherwise applied to an on-draft serving at one of my favorite haunts.
A. Golden-straw, like liquid sunshine. Not hazy at all, and the head is wonderfully tall and fluffy, lingering quite a while as it helps aerate that hop scent into the air. This is pretty much exactly how I like my beer to look.
S. Pine resin, mangoes, apricots, sweet malt, pineapple, papaya, its an entire tropical fruit salad in the middle sandwiched between two "buns" that are actually pine cones. :) It is worth emphasizing that I have yet to find an IPA which has more MANGO smell than this brew...and because I like mangoes and hops a hell of a lot, therefore I like this beer a hell of a lot.
T. Okay, the taste starts out as grapefruit peel, shifts to orange peel, more pine cones, etc. Amazingly complex. Practically every aspect of hop flavor is represented, and yet none of these aspects are overdone or wear out their welcome. Citra hops on their own don't do this. Three Floyds must pair Citra up with something else that fills in the gaps Citra makes. Something I can't quite put my finger on which is the perfect backup band for Citra's front man.
M. The one and only niggling complaint I have is that the carbonation could be slightly higher for my taste. Strangely enough, I haven't had carbonation problems in bombers, only on tap. Its a strange trade-off between higher tropical hop aspects if served on tap and the better carbonation of having it in a bottle. I choose...the hops! :)
This is one of my old standbys, as well as my IPA gold standard. Cannot possibly recommend this one highly enough for what it deserves. 1,897 charactersWastingFreetime, May 22, 2011

Clear orange-yellow pour with two finger head, good retention and incredible lacing. The smell is nothing short of heaven! Huge citrus notes with freshly picked resiny hops and a touch of bubblegum. The taste is just as incredible as the nose. Tons of citrus, fresh picked resiny hops, and pine, but perfectly balanced with just enough sweet caramel malt to offset the bitterness. The alcohol is non-existent making this scary drinkable. This is probably the smoothest imperial IPA I've ever had. Maybe the best. It's definitely in the same class as PTE, Hopslam, and Sculpin.

4.55/5  rDev +3.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5I cracked open this bomber and took a whiff of its contents and got slapped in the face by the aroma. Typical IIPA bouquet of ripe tropical fruit and flowers. I poured it into a 3 Floyds glass and it emerged a hazy apricot color with a perfect, fine, frothy white head that has excellent retention and lacing.
What a beer! I was expecting this beer to be far more bitter than it is. What you get is a dry, sharp, piney, fruity, citrus-like flavor up front that gets really, really creamy and buttery in mid-palate before kicking you in the tongue one more time as you swallow. Another triumph for Three Floyds. I am a huge, huge fan of their beers. I wish I could get a better selection of them where I live, but I'm very grateful for the few that I do have access to.
Further notes - I've had this beer several times since my first review. The thing about this beer that still dazzles me is the feel. It is unbelievably creamy for an Imperial IPA. The nose is rank with ripe tropical fruit and the bitterness on the palate is aggressive, but there is a really solid malt presence behind all those hops and it makes the drinkability go through the roof without adding excessive sweetness to the beer. 1,202 charactersdeadonhisfeet, May 21, 2011
4.92/5  rDev +12.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Poured from a bomber into a Unibroue tulip.
A: Pours a slightly hazy honey orange. One finger of off-white head with strong retention and lace. Tons of tiny bubbles on the bottom of the glass.
S: Pine and citrus on top, peaches and mangoes in the middle, sweet malt underneath. It's a nose full that persists through the glass.
T: Yum! A thousand pine needle darts briefly assail the tongue before yielding to a sweet, spicy malt. Pine comes back on the end like a finishing coat of lacquer. Alcohol is just barely perceptible as a flavor. As the beer warms, some mango murmurs and dark fruit whispers come off the bench to mix things up. The pine never gives up and towers above throughout the glass.
M: Medium mouthfeel, quite creamy with a little smooth oily swab at the end. Dangerously drinkable.
O: Lives up to the hype, a fantastic DIPA, second only to Hopslam from what I've had so far, and even then, a very close second indeed. Drink it and be happy. Too bad it's not in Iowa, but Illinois is not that far away. Oh, yeah. 1,036 charactersAmericanGothic, May 21, 2011
4.92/5  rDev +12.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Big thanks to Bay01 for sending this one to me. Poured from the bomber into my DFH Signature glass. Split the bomber with my girlfriend.
A—Vibrant burnt orange color, lots of carbonation bubbles, and a fluffy white head produced with a vigorous pour.
S—Heavy hops, tangy citrus (grapefruit, orange, pineapple). Floral notes are prominent. Smells like freshly cut grass and pinecones.
T—Like sucking on a pinecone. Heavy hops; very bitter taste. The alcohol is hidden nicely. The citrus is prominent, but plays second fiddle to the hops.
M—Heavy bodied. Lots of alcohol and a sweet syrup-feel.
O—This is fantastic. One of the best DIPAs I have ever tasted. It’s the perfect blend of hops and citrus for me. I cannot stand overly-sweetened DIPAs, but this is dry and hoppy enough to satisfy me! I wish this were readily available in my area. 856 charactersMosley1212, May 21, 2011

Imagine Gumballhead on steroids. The aroma was fruity. Color was a lovely brown. Best part was the mouthfeel. The high ETOH concentration was not overpowering. After two of these, it already started to do the trick. I was able to get a growler to go too. Will save that for tomorrow. 381 charactersDangQuesadilla, May 20, 2011
4.45/5  rDev +1.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a bottle into a standard pint glass.
Appearance: Pours an amber color with a golden tint. There is a two finger foamy, thick off white head of which just a layer remains.
Smell: Sweet citrus hops, apricots and pineapple, quite crisp.
Taste: Very bitter but well balanced. Citrus peel bitterness with a mild sweetness. Not a lot of malt, but just enough, some alcohol in the finish.
Mouthfeel: Medium body with delicate carbonation. The finish is slick.
Overall: Very good beer. The hop profile is wonderful. Very smooth and easy to drink given the amount of hops and abv. 588 charactersoline73, May 20, 2011
4.97/5  rDev +13.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Thanks to given2flybrewing for the beer.
A- Pours a beautiful orange/yellow with a one finger fluffy white head. Hazy, and the head sticks around fairly well.
S- I could smell this as soon as I popped the cap, mangoes, maybe a bit of grassiness, and spice. Very very fragrant and dense, great stuff. 
T- Not overly bitter, not astringent, and not too sweet. Nothing negative to really say about this, it's much like the smell, very fruity and a bit spicy. Not much malt to speak of, but it's certainly doing what it should be. Gives a very very slightly sweet finish. 
M- Well carbonated, medium bodied. Coats the mouth in hop flavors, but doesn't dry or leave anything undesirable. Perfect for a IIPA. 
O- A beer like this is tough to come by. I think the biggest thing I like about this is there isn't too much of any one thing. Not too much tropical fruity sweetness, not too much bitterness, not too much malt, and not too heavy. Wonderful. 949 characterssirdillon, May 19, 2011
4.56/5  rDev +3.9%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.522oz. bottle poured into a tulip glass
A - The color of wild honey. An aggressive pour yields a head with the color and consistency of whipped cream. Heavy lacing on the glass. Simply gorgeous. 
S - woodsy and fruity, with hints of pine. 
T - It tastes like fresh Hopslam with less honey. There is a hoppy bitterness that lingers in the back of the throat. 
M - Good carbonation. Very crisp and refreshing.
O - This is an excellent IIPA. I don't have much to add to what has already been said, but if you like Pliny, Hopslam, and Double Trouble you would be well advised to give this a taste! 597 charactersmklooster, May 19, 2011
4.02/5  rDev -8.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Glassware: Bruery tulip
10oz pour from the 22oz bomber yields a 1 finger white head, but the lacing is minimal and the head fades almost entirely. Clarity is very good on this medium yellow/orange beauty.
Sweet tropical scents dominated by mango and peach as well as some floral notes, strong and nearly perfect.
Strong bitterness to this one that lingers on the back of the tongue. Mostly getting Simcoe in the taste, seems pretty one note, very disappointing after the superb smell but still enjoyable. Fruity notes of mango, apricot and peaches. Malt profile is nice but I, personally, could use more of it as the bitterness becomes a bit cloying. 
Low carbonation, a bit too low for me, but goes down fairly smooth and drinkability is still good.
Overall, for $10 a bomber this beer is overpriced in my opinion. Even so, it is still a nice interpretation of the style and a good introduction to some non-west-coast Double IPAs for me. 938 charactersLSUPT, May 18, 2011

A- good color decent head
S- good smell a little hop, pine and apricot
T- excellent even with the high alcohol level. Great with bold food like a blue cheese burger or BBQ. It is better enjoyed with food it brings out more flavor

wow, this is citrirific on the nose! grapefruit and tangerines are so strong, it reminds me of sticking my head in a secondary bucket during dry hopping. this bad boy has to be fresh (FFF, please date your beer)!
tastes just like it smells... citrus hops all over the place. like sucking on a grapefruit peel. the fruit cup tastes lingers for days as the bitter pine bite sneeks up in the aftertaste. can taste the warming alcohol further down the glass and it is enjoyable.
also, the malty backbone is subtly lingering in the background and behaving just like malts should in an IPA. brings incredible depth without steeling the show. 
medium body with appropriate carbonation. very smooth and creamy for an IPA. 
fantastic beer. I am a hophead and this may have just dethroned Hopslam as my favorite hoppy beer. three cheers for Three Floyds! 1,011 charactershaddon, May 18, 2011
4.5/5  rDev +2.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Intro: 22 oz. bottle in a tulip glass. Shared with a friend.
Appearance: Good pillowy, wheat colored head, almost like clouds floating on the top of the liquid, at least two fingers in depth, with lacing that clings to the side of the glass.
Smell: Fresh hoppy smell with a slight tone of citrus, orange, and lemon, just on the edge
Taste: Rich and creamy taste with lots of hops, not tasting the citrus I get from the smell.
Mouthfeel: It has a crisp and clean feel in the mouth with some dryness, but refreshing.
Overall: This beer appears in my top ten list because of its sharp and well balanced hop flavor that does not disappoint. Being a DIPA fan, tried and true, I return to this beer frequently and try to always keep some on hand. 745 charactersheysuz, May 18, 2011
4.42/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Appearence: The color of the beer was between a deep golden and a burnt orange color which is beautiful- slight haze that dissipates as the beer warms.
Smell: The smell was completely wonderful- nice smooth hop smell with ropes of citrus running through the air. The mouth feel was perfect with just the right amount of carbonation.
Taste: The taste was mostly hopalicious with a mellow malt flavor that perfectly balanced it out- i only detected a slight alcohol flavor that was perfectly covered.
Mouthfeel:This has a nice amount of carbonation that adds a creamy feel to it. 
Overall: As far as drinkability goes i was reaching for the next bottle not long after drinking the first sip. This is one smooth, perfectly balanced Imperial IPA's that i am glad to have a supply of. I will be a buyer of this for the rest of my life! 834 charactersRampage1, May 17, 2011

A: Solid looking DIPA. Good medium sized head that slowly fades into the light amber body.
S: Crisp mango, citrus and rind, some caramel sweetness. Very inviting.
T: Follows the above smells. Excellent flavor. Light mango/tropical notes weave through the citrus and resinous hop character. Not bruisingly hoppy or bitter, but great concentration of flavor.
M: Very easy drinking for the concentration. Good body that is refreshed by the hops and carbonation. No stickiness or residual sweetness which I like.
O: Excellent brew. Will happily have this again. Great balance and expertly crafted. It may not have been amazing in any area, but all of the components are exemplary and as a whole, superb! 738 charactersoregone, May 17, 2011

O: WOW! Dare I say it, but is this Bell's Hopslam's Indiana cousin? I loved the citrus aroma and flavor. It should be a big sipper, but the flavor is so refreshing/abv well encased, on this 83 + muggy day in Chicago. Hopheads will love this and perhaps nice choice for someone new to Imperial IPAs and not crazy about all earthy pine flavor.

A-Light orange, carbonation is present, semi-clear and lacing is left.
S-Citrus and Floral hops a abundant.
T-Very well balanced, citrus and floral to start with. The 99 IBUs are present. However the bottle says caramel malts are present, I'm not picking those up. Also no earthy tones for me. My friend found them but I couldn't
M-Medium bodied with carbonation 
O-Glad I tried it, love the style and this is another solid representation. Only wish there was more earthy tones present in the taste. 555 charactersrlee1390, May 11, 2011
4.8/5  rDev +9.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5My first time having it thanks to a trade. Of the most talked about DIPAs that often get compared to each other, Hopslam is the only one I've had before Dreadnaught, and I've been wanting to try it for a long time!
Appearance: A deep gold with a half finger thick head which leaves a lacing along the side of my glass.
Smell: Immediately smelled grapefruit once opening the bottle. More citrus forward with some pine in the back.
Taste: Hoppy! Lots of hop flavor (fruity followed by piney), but without being too bitter. A great balanced taste that is far from being a hop-bomb
Mouthfeel: A small amount of bitterness stays on your tongue after swallowing gives a dry finish. Not too much carbonation.
Overall: A great representation of my favorite style of beer. I wish it was available to me here in Florida! 815 charactersStankonia, May 09, 2011

On cask, this beer is just perfect. Smooths out to the point you think you might be drinking hop flavor water with the perfect wetness. I wish this can always be in cask form. The grapefruit and hops are really present in the cask version when compare to the bottle and tap. Try to hunt down this verison! 325 charactersSeeker41184, May 08, 2011

S: Could smell it from the opening of the bottle. Big mango hop aroma with sweet malts to back it up. Damn near perfection.
T: Big citrus/melon hop flavors up front with bitterness to push just past balance with the absurd amount of malts used. This beer achieves hop flavors unlike most others I've had. Stunning. World class flavor.
M: Dreadnaught leaves your mouth covered in resinous hop juices. Lasting bitterness. It's like sucking on pure lupalin glands.
O: I will sing the praises of this beer as long as live. Absolutely phenomenal. FFF has a way of taking hops and making them their bitch. 759 charactersGreencoat, May 08, 2011

Pours off the tap a nice orange with a big foamy white head. Some great lacing as the head dissipates. Smells very hoppy with some pine and citrus hitting right off the bat. There is a nice sweetness that comes along with it on the nose as well. Tastes very malty and hoppy. A perfect balance of solid thick sweet malt backbone and a sharp and crisp bitter hop flavour with lots of citrus and pine. Full bodied and very nicely carbonated. I've had this before many times but I have to say, on draft the profile is cleaner and more balanced then I've ever had out of the bottle. Overall, a great DIPA and a solid drinker
Overall: I am impressed. this is a really great example of a DIPA. I wish I could get these more often. 820 charactersUrbancaver, May 07, 2011

A: Orangey tan color with 3/4 finger head that dissipates immediately, very little lacing
S: Slight apricot and grapefruit nose, not overly aromatic 
T: Excellent citrus hop flavor balanced by caramel sweetness. Not overly bitter or crazy, no alcohol flavor to speak of.
M: Medium body and slight carbonation
O: After reviewing FFF APW just before this, this beer seems much more well balanced, less hop bitterness but not as much excellent hop flavor. This beer feels like a safer, more "to style" IIPA compared to APW, but it may be older and less awesome due to age. From what I remember from the draft at FFF, I'd go with APW over Dreadnaught. 745 charactersMrGaryFish, May 07, 2011

I have had this three times in the last couple of months and it has been different each time. The age of the bottles could explain this.
A- Medium, slightly hazy orange with an off-white, large head. Good retention and lacing.
S- Strong hop pine scents. That is about it.
T- Similar to the smell. I wish there was a bit more citrus here to balance it.
D- Nice carbonation, but bitter all around.

Appearance: Darker yellow, almost amber in color with a really large amount of off white head leaving good lacing.
Smell: Citrus smell with something that has a mild sweetness to it. It has almost a peachy smell on top of the citrus. I definitely expected more of a hoppy smell then this has, it is balanced nicely by the sweetness.
Taste: Strong hoppy bitterness at first that mellows out a little but keeps the nice hop flavor. There is still a hint of the "peachy" sweetness flavor hidden in the background. I like this a lot but it is for sure a hoppy beer. 612 charactersruckus232, May 03, 2011

A - very piney, with sweet citrus, orange, apricots maybe some peachy sweetness. expected a much larger aroma from this one, but what is there smells good.
T - the pine again and sweetness from the mango, peach and apricot. bready and caramel malt background taken down by the hoppy bitterness of pine sap and orange peel in the back. noticeable alcohol but not much, majority pine and sweet citrus. this beer is shaping up to be 3FF biased over hyped brew
M - medium bodied with low carbonation great creamy mouth feel with a slight dry finish. 
O - Good, not the best. is this the 8th best dipa? definitely not IMO, ill have to try it again but it could be awhile, it will have to fall in my lap. Maybe it needs more of a balance between the hoppy pine bitterness, fruity and floral notes.

4.39/5  rDev 0%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Bomber poured into a tulip glass. A vigorous pour leaves a clear orange/copper beer with a half a finger of bubbly white head that dissipates immediately, leaving some large bubbles along the collar. Not much lacing on the glass after swirling. Some carbonation is visible slowly rising up from the bottom of the glass. 
As soon I popped open the cap on the bomber, I could smell the aroma, and this came right out of the fridge. Sweet tropical fruits, mango and funky papaya, orange and grapefruit peel and pith, and pine hops. Some sweet caramel malt shows up as the beer warms up further, but the hop aroma also improves nicely.
Taking a sip, some tropical fruit and citrus bitterness upfront, then a wash of caramel and bread malt finishes off the tongue. Finish is unexpectedly clean, with only a feint hint of pine bitterness on the back of the tongue. After such a nice aroma, I was slightly disappointed the flavor of the hops didn't play a bigger part in the taste, but still a good DIPA.
Light to medium body with some nice gently prickly carbonation and lightly slick on the tongue. Pretty easy to drink despite the ABV as the alcohol is fairly well hidden. 1,171 charactersnataku00, Apr 30, 2011
4.43/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to Another6Pack for this bottle! Poured into my goblet.
Appearance: A very nice clear burnt orange with wonderful frothy head that leaves some nice lacing.
Smell: The hops is not overpowering. I can actually smell the malt backbone a little in addition to the citrus and floral hops aromas.
taste: This is not a one sided hops bomb IPA. Very complex with toasted malts with a nice caramel like flavor. The hop bitterness takes the form of citrus and pine like flavors with a bit of earthiness. There is a bit residual sweetness also.
Mouthfeel: This beer is full bodied but the carbonation is such that the body is never heavy. The flavors are so intense that they coat the mouth really well.
Overall: I am impressed. this is a really great example of a DIPA. I wish I could get these more often. 808 characterskagent777, Apr 30, 2011

Poured a hazy sunset orange with 2.5 fingers of off white head. Excellent lacing. Very sticky
Smell was a little disappointing... Not nearly as strong as I was anticipating. Getting orange rind citrus hops and a very present Carmel malt. Catching some orange flesh and maybe some faint grapefruit. Nothing overpowering at all
Taste makes up for where the smell let me down. Follows the nose but with more of a punch to the tastebuds. 
Mouthfeel was medium bodied but was thin for it's style. Good amount of carbonation and a drying hop aftertaste
Overall I would buy this beer all day if it were available in my area. It's a really good beer and goes down smooth but it did not separate itself as a top notch IIPA in my opinion. 779 charactersdcloeren, Apr 29, 2011

Neat aroma. Tart pine, peaches, smoky, and a sweet/ripe mash backing it up.
That's a lot of big flavors for a dipa. Definite smoky/peaty flavors with tart, piny hops and bitter grapefruit. Sweet and juicy with that bitter grapefruit overload. Nice dry, puckering, bitter finish. 441 charactersbirderbeerer, Apr 28, 2011
4.47/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Appearance - This beer had a semi-clear bright orangish/peach color. A medium white head that was none too large. Had average retention and even better lacing. Several small bubbles rising from the bottom. The head was comprised of very small bubbles. The head settled to an inconsistent patchy film across the top.
Smell - Tangerine and grapefruit citrus. Some peach notes. Very well balanced. Strong hop presence. Smells fresh, resinous and correct. Perfumy. A minor, miniscule alcohol tone. Smells nicely sweet also. 
Taste - Prounounced hop bitterness. Tangerine and grapefruit citrus. Sweet. A conspicuous alcohol warmth that was very welcoming and satisfactory. A bit of a bready malt in the taste as it warmed. Fresh. Very well balanced. Clean tasting. Only a touch of caramel. 
Mouthfeel - Meidum mouthfeel. Sticky and smooth (if that is even possible). Crisp. Tons of flavor left on the palate. Very, very dry. Medium carbonation. Smooth alcohol warmth. 
A great brew. Super easy to drink. Could be enjoyed year round. Thoroughly enjoyable. Definitely one I will pick up again. Could make a night of this with ease. Almost quaffable. 1,146 charactersShrews629, Apr 25, 2011

Spicy hop aroma with pine, peaches and biscuit. Flavor is a good balance of fruity and spicy hops and sweet caramel malts. Not as hop forward as a west coast dipa, and not as heavy and sweet as an east coast dipa. Intermediate between the two - must be a third coast dipa!
Medium bodied with a nice mouthfeel. A great beer that is well crafted and definitely worth seeking out. 477 charactersCliffBrake, Apr 22, 2011
4.62/5  rDev +5.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A- 4.5 This is eerily similar to PtE in appearance (just had that last night)... Pure golden color and barely clear on the pour with a big 2 finger off-white head. The head sticks all over the tulip glass as it dissipates down to about a 1/4" level through the drink. Very uniform look with micro bubbles slowly but lively dancing about give it a smooth and nice appearance.
S- 5 Dreadnaught has a great, powerful, and floral hoppy aroma up front. It is just a bit citrusy, not as much so as other IIPAs I've had, but where that is lacking it brings a nice caramel / light malt backdrop to the table that really rounds it out nicely.
T- 4.5 This tastes excellent. It is well-balanced as it has a strong hop presence initially that turns to a sweet fruit combination of grapefruit and peach with a bit of malt. Its alcohol is well-hidden. As it warms I can taste honey; maybe that is an effect of the aforementioned flavors' combination...
M- 4.5 This feels very good for the most part, but leaves a syrupy dry finish. It is, however, a very manageable medium body with just-right carbonation.
D- 4.5 Although it is readily available to me for the most part, this is basically a special occasion brew. It is very good, it is very strong, and it is very expensive. Those don't add up to an everyday drinker of a beer... That said, for the style, it is up there with the best of 'em and a bomber is a piece of cake. The awesome scent and tasty, balanced taste of the Dreadnaught are why it is touted so highly. This is a great IIPA. 1,533 charactersKYBrewgrass, Apr 21, 2011
4.42/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5This beer was part of the Midwestern sampler I brought with me when I moved to Texas.
Poured into a sniffer.
Appearance: Orange/ golden appearance with about a fingers worth of white head. There is a nice steady flow of small bubbles rising up the sides of the glass.
Aroma: Lots of hoppy goodness! Pine, citrus, a subtle amount of tropical fruit, and grapefruit. The hops over power any maltiness that could be there, but as a hophead I'm ok with that.
Taste: The surprising part of this beer is how balanced it is, compared to what you would think based off of the smell. There is a lingering bitterness from the hop power of this beer and a nice dry finish to bring out its full hop potential. The exceptional part of this beer is the nice malty backbone that balances and accentuates the hops.
Mouthfeel: Dry finish, with medium body and a nice amount of carbonation to wake up the taste buds. 
Overall: One of the best double IPAs I've ever had. Exponentially balanced with a great aroma. Highly recommend if you're in the Indiana, FFF region, you pick some up. 1,072 charactersjamescain, Apr 19, 2011
4.82/5  rDev +9.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Review from notes:
Comes to me in a pint glass, medium gold but no haze, very transparent, with an inch of white head that leaves beautiful lacing, very clingy.  Smells citrusy, a lot of grapefruit, a touch of orange, smells great.  Tastes hoppy, grapefruit at the front, immediately followed by sweet malts and an extremely nice citrus hop finish.  The bitter from the hops is definitely there, but the malty backbone really balances this beer, to the point that it too drinkable for a beer of this ABV.  If this came in 6 packs I would probably be divorced, even though I'm not even married yet.  Wow, outstanding.  I've had the Younger, the Elder, Hopslam and all of the other super hyped beers, and this one really stands out and lives up to the hype.

S: Sticky pine aroma, with some citrus and mango.
T: Right from the fridge it's malty and grassy, and a bit one-note. As it warms, more pine comes out and a pleasant, mild sweetness.
M: medium body, medium linger. Some bitterness in the back of the mouth and throat, but not much. Low-medium carbonation
O: A nicely balanced DIPA that drinks very nicely. Doesn't knock your socks off with any particularly intense or exotic flavors, but is something I would definitely drink regularly if I could. 551 characterskscaldef, Apr 15, 2011
4.33/5  rDev -1.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to JoshVandy for this one.
22 oz bottle into a Portsmouth tulip.
A: It pours a yellow gold color that reveals orange hues when held up to the light. Decent clarity for such a heavily hopped brew. From a strong pour it yielded a two finger white head that exhibited very good retention. White soapy lace streaks the sides of the glass.
S: Hops galore, pineapple, citrus, apricots, a hint of pine, and peaches. The hops are so dominant that it is really hard to pick out any malty tones. It also smells spicy/soapy and a bit on the hot side.
T: Good gracious, the taste of this brew greatly out shines the nose. The hops are incredibly jammy; peach, apricot, and pineapple jump out. Pine cones show up in the finish, most likely the bittering hops. The more I drink this the peach notes are bursting out like crazy. It finishes dry with none of the hotness in the nose.
M: Medium bodied with a good deal of carbonation. 
O: I am really glad I got the chance to try this DIPA. It certainly is one of a kind it terms of the hop profile, and it holds it's own amongst some of the great DIPA's. Delicious beer, cheers! 1,124 charactersNeffbeer, Apr 15, 2011
4.34/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 22oz bottle into a tulip.
Pours orange/light amber with one finger of bright white head.
Nose is citrus and tropical fruit: orange, pineapple, grapefruit, passionfruit, peaches, mango. Very fruity. 
Taste is similar, very fruity and citrusy, but matched well with a nice malty sweetness. Ends slightly bitter from the hops, but not overpowering like a lot of DIPAs. 
Mouthfeel is medium bodied (lighter than a lot of DIPAs) and slick with just the right carbonation. Slightly dry in the aftertaste, but nothing unexpected.
Drinkability is excellent. This is very tasty and the 9.5% ABV is unnoticable. Drinks more like a single IPA than a double.
Thanks to itsthelibyans on the reddit beertrade forum for this one. 734 charactersVMWhelan, Apr 12, 2011

Smell - lots of very lovely sweet tropical fruit. Sweet like honey with a small hint of piny hops.
Taste - follows the nose very well. A strong combination of tropical fruit, sweet honey, with a balanced amount of whole hops. A very well done imperial by all means.
Over - it's a very sweet well balanced imperial ipa that goes down very nicely. A beer well done. 422 charactersbadboyrsl84, Apr 10, 2011

a: Bright orange with an amber hue on the side of the glass.
s: All tropical fruit. A lot of peaches and mango as the bottle says. Not as overpowering as other IIPAs, but really good smell.
t: Not as big of a taste as expected from the smell. Very restrained IIPA. Hops are there, but it is not mouth puckering.
m: 3 Floyd's have hidden the 9.5% abv behind everything else. It is extremely balanced and goes down extremely easily. 
I love the opportunity to try 3 Floyd's beers. This is a very balanced IIPA. Not what I expected, but a great beer. The complexity of the tropical fruit is done very well. I would definitely love to have more bottles of this or any other 3 Floyd's stuff. 766 charactersShumania, Apr 09, 2011
4.17/5  rDev -5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Dreadnaught is one of the first beers that really made me appreciate how big can also be balanced. This is truly a beer every hop head should try once in their life, and I'm happy to have sampled it many times in the past. It's on my list of beers I'll always enjoy whenever our paths cross.
That being said, it's not the prettiest beer. Dreadnaught is a murky, orange color and is way cloudy. The head and lace are better than the color and clarity, but, then again, you didn't expect a bruiser like this to be pretty and neither did I.
The smell is hands-down the best part of the beer. Huge citrus and tropical notes jump out, spreading orange, pineapple, mango and grapefruit notes with a touch of pine thrown in. It's expressive and some sweet malt even makes itself known. The alcohol is fairly well masked, but emerges from time to time. As it warms, the tropical notes shine.
When I dig deep and objectively rate the taste, setting aside all the sentimental memories of sipping this back when 3 Floyds was in Ohio and bringing back cases from trips to the Brewery, this just isn't up there with the best DIPA's in the world. That's not to say it doesn't come close. The tropical and citrus notes from the nose carry over to the taste. The bitterness is huge without being too oily or ruinous. The thing that kills this beer's chances of a top ranking from me is the way the malt invades the tasting experience. I wish it had just a touch less caramel and sweetness, but maybe that helps hold the bitterness in check. Either way, this is good, very good, but not world-class and the bits of alcohol seal its fate.
The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a creamy feel from the carbonation. It's also very drinkable and overall a great beer. It's hard to take an honest look in the mirror sometimes, but finally writing my thoughts on Dreadnaught has been somewhat therapeutic. I'll always love this beer, flaws and all. Perhaps that's a part of it's charm. 1,963 charactersjampics2, Apr 07, 2011

Pours a slightly hazy, medium orange color with a thin off-white head atop. Foam retention is there but isn't completely covering the top of the beer. Hops make their presence known immediately. Mango and peach fight for a spot in the front of this hop parade. Rich malt profile provides firm foundation for the hops to continue their dance. Grassiness. Bitterness jabs the taste buds from all directions and keeps on punching after the semi-dry finish. Medium/medium-full bodied feel with a moderate carbonation. 
Overall, a great DIPA. Plenty of intense hop flavor atop a well-formed malt backbone. Drinkable though a slight astringency seems present. 746 charactersBrewerB, Apr 07, 2011

*From notes
A BIG thanks goes out to claaark13 for this one. Cheers, Sean!
It should be noted that this is my 100th review!
A: An ever-so slightly golden haze. When poured with mild force, it yields a great 1.75 finger head and some ridiculous lacing.
S: Soft and mellow fruits dance around my nostrils. Pineapples and mangos bask in the tropical sun and create a waft of amazing hoppy delight.
T: Addicting - this one is a luscious mix of melon and slightly bitter but refined hop oil. A wave of malt washes up on the mid, followed by a finish that can only be described as tropically delicious. Nowhere is the 9.5% ABV found, it's perfectly integrated into the brew.
M: Rich and thick. Dreadnaught doesn't play around. The bubbles are perfectly balanced - this one really maximizes it's real estate within the mouth.
O: What a killer beer. Three Floyd's Dreadnaught is one of the best DIPA's I've had the pleasure of imbibing. Having had this next to their Arctic Panzer Wolf, I would describe this one as much more laid back and mellow - the Type B to Panzer's Type A.
Seek this bottle out and enjoy the shit out of it.

A - Light brown/golden brown coloring. Pours with a great-looking, albeit slightly thin, eggshell-colored head. Good lacing on the sides as well as a lot of carbonation coming up from the bottom of the glass. 
S - Aromatic bomb. Tons of citrus (orange, lemon zest, grapefruit notes), slight piney undertone, some malts (caramel mainly, toffee might be a stretch). 
T - So very balanced. I love the malt backbone on this one; it blends so exceptionally well with the pure hop characters expressed in the aroma. Great citrus notes contrast with caramel sweetness. Bitter character from hops hits at the backend of the drink. A little bit of heat; ABV isn't totally hidden in the taste. 
M - Medium body, rather smooth. Not overly dry, slight aftertaste at the very back of the tongue. Carbonation is average, seems like it could be a bit better. 
D - It's ironic that I'm reviewing this from a bottle tasting seeing as I've had it on tap at 3 Floyds brewpub at least 3 times now. It is better in Munster, but this bottle wasn't completely fresh. Still, the essence of Dreadnaught was obvious. Considering the ABV, it drinks absurdly easily. Blame the amazingly-refined hop/malt balance. It's exceptionally enjoyable even for someone who isn't the biggest DIPA fan. 1,342 charactersAuracom, Apr 01, 2011

Pours a slightly orange gold color. A little hazy. One finger head. Aroma is hoppy with citrus and pine. Tastes floral and citrusy at first and then a little dry and bitter towards the back. Beautiful and well-balanced hop presence. Alcohol taste is minimal. Slight sticky feel in your mouth.
An exceptional and perfectly balanced DIPA. 376 charactersEthan27, Mar 31, 2011

No bottled-on date that I could find...
Aroma: Pine, papaya, & fresh-cut grass hop notes; malt shows up as light brown sugar and, would you believe, cotton candy??
Appearance: Golden amber, 2-finger off-white foamy head slowly collapsed to 1/2 finger, and hung around for the remainder of the glass. Excellent lacing washed onto the sides of the glass after each sip.
Flavor: Grapefruit, light pine resin, and caramel-malty sweetness round out bitterness. Bitterness is not harsh and drying like what I've tasted in other IIPAs. Delicious bitterness hangs around through the finish.
Mouthfeel: Medium body & carbonation. Again, not drying like other representations of this style.
Drinkability: A highly enjoyable imperial IPA. No bottled-on date leads me to wonder what this one might have tasted like fresh out of the brewery. Nonetheless, very well-balanced. I don't find ANY flaws with this one. I definitely recommend trying! 977 charactersmdvatab, Mar 31, 2011
4.35/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5When poured, a translucent orange liquid settles a very foggy amber orange with an ample amount of creamy colored head.
Silky lacing clings to the edges of the glass.
Sliced apricot, peach, and mango are noticed up front. This is followed by a sweet malty scent.
The taste bold, full of bitter and fruity hop offerings. There is a significant amount of apricot and grapefruit taste. In the mix lies a sweet and caramel tasting backbone. There is a great balance between hop and malt here. The alcohol is fused with a wheat malt taste and leaves an interesting aftertaste.
The mouthfeel is crisp and smooth. Not too bitter, holding a bold malt profile that leaves a silky feeling throughout. Ample carbonation contributes.
Overall, awesome DIPA that keeps it balanced between ingrediants. I am curious as to see how the sweet malt in this would take over with age. 867 charactersChugginOil, Mar 29, 2011

A heavy handed pour into my Duvel tulip yeilds a two finger layer of white foam which fades rapidly leaving a thin, white coaster atop the beer, and some nice lacing. The aroma is big citrus, with a hint of sweet malt accompanying. Taste follows the nose with huge orange, pineapple and mango flavors dominating. A very nice caramel malt backbone balances the hell out of this brew making it less bitter than I anticipated. This isn't a bad thing, however, as I am enjoying the complex marriage of sweet malt and citrus hops that is in play in this beer. The finish is both bitter and sweet with a nice dryness at the end. An appropriate level of carbonation lends a somewhat creamy texture to the beer, which is very satisfying. Overall this is a wonderful DIPA from Three Floyds. Not the uber-bitter, palate destroying, west coast hop bomb I'm used to, but a very tasty and exceedingly drinkable take on the style. Another winner from FFF! 1,013 charactersSideswipe, Mar 27, 2011
4.42/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5RATINGS EDITED 3/15/2014.
Poured out of a bomber into my Three Floyds Alpha King glass.
A: Pretty light in color for an IPA. Pale and yellowish. The color of wheat.
S: Smells like my kind of IPA! Big hops obviously, lots and lots of citrus. Obviously a very fresh bottle judging from the amazing aromas (of course I knew that already).
T: Just perfect. Amazing citrus flavors, the best I've had in an IPA at any ABV. In addition to the faintly lemony and orange-ish citrus flavors it shares with many other good IPAs using northwestern hops, there are delicious hints of mango and other tropical fruits (pineapple maybe?). The only beer I've had that made me think of mangos when describing the taste. The hops are here in force, no doubt, but it's also extremely well balanced with nice sweetness to complement the citrus. Not violently bitter like Ruination or that ilk.
M: Just what I want from a double IPA. The carbonation is just right. So refreshing, and not boozy at all. The drinkability is evident in the amazing speed at which I always finish bottles of this masterpiece, I just can't stop drinking it (and usually verbally praising it after every gulp).
O: My favorite IPA at any level of ABV. Astounding citrus flavors, complex taste, perfect balance between the flavors. And, thank God, it's available year round.

Pours a light gold with less than a finger of thick head that lingers for some time. The nose is typical pine but not as aromatic as other DIPA's I had this night. Taste is fantastic, this is the type of DIPA I like. Lots of citrus and tropical fruit (pineapple, mango, papaya). The pine is of lesser note in the flavor than it was on the nose, and that's fine with me. Bitterness in the aftertaste is just perfect. Drinkability is high, this one went down with mouth watering for more. 516 characterswchollif, Mar 25, 2011
4.62/5  rDev +5.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.522 oz bottle from LiquidBread219. No bottling dates.
Orange-amber body with a slight chill haze that clears up as it warms. Brownish-white head, thick and foamy. Settles out to a thin cover. Leaves some nice lacing at first.
Aromas of pine resin, like pitch directly from a tree. Sweet citrus aromas, either ruby red grapefruit or tangerine. Some peach esters. Caramel malts and a hint of spice.
Starts off with a fair amount of caramel and biscuit malts.Then come the hops. Very wood like, bitter and earthy. Citrus hops, vacillates between sweet grapefruit and tart, citric lemon. Leads into a pine finish, with a vague brown sugar sweetness. Warming alcohol on the finish, but not over done. Smooth and slick from the hop oils. Not much carbonation. 
This holds up easily to Pliny and Sculpin. An excellent example of the style. 835 characterslitheum94, Mar 24, 2011
4.01/5  rDev -8.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 49.5% ABV, 99 IBUs
 22 oz bomber with no freshness date poured into a snifter. However, this bottle is most likely very fresh because the store just got it in.
 Dreadnaught pours in a straw golden stream and forms a big and unwavering creamy off-white head atop the amber-peach hued beer. Very good head retention and good lacing. Very very DIPA.
 Aroma is a mix of pungent hoppy notes and fruity notes (lemon, mango), and smooth malts at the back. Taste is lush and juicy fruit -- tons of citrus and mango with a solid and pleasant sweetness. The bitterness, however, doesn't seem nearly close to the 99 IBU's tag. Right body, right carbonation and an amazingly clean finish.
 The overall regard for Dreadnaught might be because of the regard for Three Floyds but it's a very good DIPA too.

Pours a nice, somewhat dark blonde color with a fluffy head.
The taste? Just what a like in a DIPA. Starts off with a stinging grapefruit hoppiness but it then shows a tropical side to the hops as well. The label claims peach and mango, which are believable (perhaps more peach). Underneath is a thick, spicy sweet caramel malt which plays second to the hops but not by much. Doesn't leave a lot of lingering bitterness either. Just a great beer.
This is definitely a new favorite in the style for me. It's just too bad that it's difficult to get for me. 736 charactersNODAK, Mar 22, 2011

4.8/5  rDev +9.3%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5My second growler ever and my first growler review. I took a whiff straight from the growler at first and it felt like I was bitch slapped with sharp, bitter, tangy hops. I really flinched at it. Anyways pour is a massive erupting foamy off white head. Took me a few minutes to nearly fill my Duvel tulip. Body is a rich amber between sunny orange. Smell is a bit more subdued in the glass lol. Smells of sweet, spicy, grassy, pineapple and tangerine hops. One of the sweeter more citrusy IPA's I have smelled with a earthy/grassy twist. 
The grassy bitter hops is quite sharp upon the first drink and heavily bitter in the aftertaste but not in a bad way. Sweet pineapple/grapefruit with a sugary twist make a fairly brief and sudden appearance in the middle. I know IPA"s are supposed to be a bit aggressive on carbonation but this may be just, just a tad too much and there is a noticeable alcohol burn but pretty subdued for the gravity. Someone once compared it to angel tears but I think it is what Chuck Norris tears would taste like if he cried. 1,054 charactersgeneralnotsew, Mar 19, 2011

4.31/5  rDev -1.8%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4.5Ah, the heralded Dreadnaught. I brought this back from my second trip to Chicago, which I think yielded even better returns than my first trip (if that's possible!).
Live review from the bomber into my new Lost Abbey tulip, maybe not the ideal glass for a DIPA, but there's no way this glass is hurting either! It adds to the beauty of this beer, and does a nice snifter-like job of focusing the aroma.
First off, this is yet another beer that makes me regret what the Bros did to the structure of the review weights. This beer is a sight to behold, and deserves more than 5% of the total score.
A near crystal true amber color. The head is tall, easily reaching two to three fingers. Ivory white and thick, the head is very dense and meringue-like. Excellent retention and lots of tiny bubbles visible rising off the sides of my tulip. The lacing is also exquisite - sticking to the sides of the glass all the way down in what I like to call 3D lace - lace that actually has thickness or dimension to it.
The bottle says you can get mango from the aroma, but I don't. I can't be certain as to the true age of this bottle, but my best guess says it's approximately a month old. I do agree with the bottle descriptor that tangerine is present, and I also get some floral lemony notes and a decent dose of pine.
The taste picks back up again. This is one of the more citrusy tasting DIPA's out there, as it seems many these days smell like citrus but taste of pure pine. White grapefruit and tangerine steal the show here. Actually, fully warmed the white grapefruit is spot on - fleshy and bitter as hell, but wonderful too. The malt isn't too heavy, but it adds a dry crackery taste to the beer, and also seems to lend some sweetness. 
The mouthfeel isn't nearly as highly carbonated as the beer appeared, and is quite creamy in reality. The alcohol doesn't go unnoticed, but at 9.5% you don't really feel it much by way of booziness/burning. Instead, I can physically feel the warmth of the alcohol after the first half of the bomber, which isn't a bad thing, after all.
I really enjoyed this, and would like to try it again sometime when I know that it is extremely fresh, just to see what possible improvement the hops might gain. 2,240 charactersSpider889, Mar 11, 2011

smell is beautiful fresh piny hops. very strong and overpowering in a good way.
taste is pliny piny...very bitter, hoppy and fresh. similar to pliny but a bit stronger and not as smooth.
mouth is light and good carbonation.
Excellent beer. great flavors and extremely fresh. will go back. 339 charactersmryuk, Mar 07, 2011
3.07/5  rDev -30.1%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 2 | feel: 5 |  overall: 3Poured out of a bottle into a martini glass. Color seemed consistent with other IPA's of the high alcohol content variety, and it had a pleasant, slightly fruity smell. Regarding taste, you initially get hit with a flavorful mild fruit taste, but it fades into a musty bite that reminds me of the aftertaste of the awful Four Horsemen. It gains some points back in the fact that this "middle-after taste" goes away and leaves you with a reasonably happy palate. Incredibly smooth in the mouth, but slightly difficult to drink because of that musty taste in the middle. 568 charactersHockeyfan1189, Mar 03, 2011
3.74/5  rDev -14.8%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5Nice hazey peach/amber color, cannot see my fingers on the other side of the glass. Fair amount of white foam at the top.
The smell is very inviting, citrus hops in full effect as well as som piney notes under it all.
The hop bitterness is apparent immediately, trying to balance itself out with some light sweet malts but to no avail; the hops overpower the other flavors and control the brew.
Nice full mouthfeel, lingering dryness in its wake. Wish this tasted half as good as it smelled. 494 charactersdonteatpoop, Mar 02, 2011
4.05/5  rDev -7.7%look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured from a bomber, a chalky yellow haze with serious head. Smell of lots of fruit and not much hops. The taste is about the same with some caramel as well. Very smooth for a Double, no slap you in the face hops. Definately taste the 9.5%, but still very drinkable. 267 charactersknm, Mar 02, 2011

This beer features well-mixed hop flavors - varying between earthy and piney. Tart beginning, but a sweet finish. This is pretty dry compared to other DIPAs.
Average mouthfeel with a fairly high drinkability, my only fault is slightly too bitter of an aftertaste. 344 characterstmcelvain, Mar 01, 2011
3.95/5  rDev -10%look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Big thanks to Khazadum for this one...
Poured from the bomber into my tulip. No freshness info, dang. Amber in color with no head. A little hazy but mostly clear. 
Smell is quite hoppy but not particularly strong. Spicy hops dominate but there is plenty of sweet, bready malt there as well. 
Taste follows smell as with most every DIPA I've had. The hop flavor is there but not as strong as I had hoped. Quite a bit of grapefruit hops covers your palate with each sip leaving behind a healthy amount of bitterness on the sides of my tongue. It's a fairly malty brew but the malt flavor is nice, complementing the hops well. 
Mouthfeel is smooth but lacking some carbonation. Each sip leaves a little hop resin on the palate allowing you to sip the beer and enjoy it. Drinkability is pretty damn good with only a slight hint of the high %ABV. Overall a solid DIPA. I'm thinking the bottle I have isn't the freshest example but it was still quite enjoyable. 959 charactersdciBA, Feb 26, 2011

Mouthfeel: Very dry and bitter but still smooth.

4.8/5  rDev +9.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Pours an amber, burnt orange, dull gold with an initially large head that recedes to one finger and leaves some sticky cobwebs of lace. 
Smells very fruity; my girlfriend swears her initial reaction was fruity pebbles. I'm not a big fan of that cereal, so I'm not too sure. But we both agreed on: lemon, orange peel, dank weed, grapefruit, pine needles and a sweet honey-like aroma. 
The taste is huge on flavor! The fruitiness isn't as strong as the nose, but the lemons, oranges and pine are still there. In fact it's actually a really bright lemony zest that powers through a lot of other hop flavors. The dank grassiness really cuts through the middle and takes this DipA to a much deeper level. It's also much bitter than I expected and definitely the most bitter DIPA that I've had that still manages to retain such a bright flavor. The bitterness rides under the entire flavor and just dominates in the finish. It literally clings to the back of my tongue for minutes and urges me to take another drink to quell the bitter tingling. 
The mouthfeel is nice and thick, not quite as syrupy as some DiPAs and or a RIS, but pretty nice. Overall this is one of the best DIPAs I've had and perfectly mediates the space between an east and west coast IPA. Brilliant. Worthy of all praise and probably earth-shattering when fresh. 1,331 charactersblammasterj, Feb 24, 2011

S: the weakest aspect of this beer. theres definitely an abundance of citrusy hops, pineapple, zest, touch of booze, i just feel it falls a little behind when compared to all other aspects of te brew. 
T: this is the stuff. awesome citrus presence, almost an alcohol soaked pineapple paradise. bitter fruit rind, melon, just delicious.
M: such a creamy smooth texture just makes this purely enjoyable. medium carbonation brings it alive just enough on the palate to slide right down, crisp and perfect.
D: before i realize it half of this glass is gone, and i feel i could just go all night. it just gets more and more delicious as the minutes tik by. this will definitely be on my list to get again when possible. 1,014 charactersKkottonmouthkngz, Feb 21, 2011

From a bomber into a snifter. 
APPEARANCE: Pours a 1 ½ finger, medium-thick, fluffy, white head with good retention. Perfectly clear and burnt orange or tenne in color, though more gamboge when held to the light. Absolutely zero carbonation evident. Head eventually fades to a good wisp and coats the sides of the glass. A splotchy wisp and ring remain until the end and leave some nice lacing down the glass.
SMELL: Pale malts, honeydew melon and pineapple notes. Citrus, grapefruit, and faint floral hop notes as well. Very nice and fruity nose. Medium strength, but nicely enticing. 
TASTE: Pale malts, honeydew melon and some sweet pineapple and mango up front. Moves into a bitter grapefruit and floral hop finish. Lots of citrus bitterness after the swallow, introducing a bold and lingering bitter grapefruit and citrusy aftertaste. Big flavors, especially after the swallow, and very tasty stuff. 
PALATE: Medium body and carbonation, and very creamy smooth on the palate. Goes down smooth but with a bit of an alcohol scratch after the swallow. Finishes slightly dry on the palate. Really nice stuff. 
OVERALL: Stellar double IPA. Flavorful, enjoyable, and very drinkable. A bitter, citrus hop bomb with a wonderful, creamy palate. I can definitely see why this is so highly regarded, and why FFF fans swear by it. Very grateful that I had the chance to enjoy this one, and would love the chance to have it again. Thanks again for the great trade tomashardy. 1,598 charactersJeffo, Feb 16, 2011

Taste has a juicy blast from the get go. Solid sweet citrusy malt background with a lighter caramel base. Tremendous flowery hop bite with a syrupy like finish. Alcohol is always there in the background. Not well hidden.

Appearance: Slightly hazy dark orange with a finger of fluffy white foam that settles down to a thin layer after a few minutes.
Smell: Resiny pine, grapefruit, pineapple, floral hops and a malty sweetness mixed as well. 
Taste: Bitey hops, bitter grapefruit and some sweet pineapple and tangerine, some malty sweetness but not as much as the nose would suggest. 
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied and absolutely no hint of alcohol.

4.14/5  rDev -5.7%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3Perfect burnt orange with a small head that faded to a ring with little lacing. On the nose it's a hop assault, piney rather than fruity. It even smells bitter. On the tongue it's a huge hop presence, pine resin, sharp, extraordinarily bitter. In the mouth it's not as huge as I had expected, maybe a medium-full body with a gigantic hoppy bitterness that lingers on and on and on. As far as drinkability, it's not something I'd turn to over and over because of its rather abrasive nature, which while pleasant in moderation could easily become overbearing. A huge DIPA. Can't decide whether I like this or Arctic Panzer Wolf better. Maybe I'll have to do a side by side on some glorious night of huge IPAs. 707 charactersEricCioe, Feb 13, 2011
3.88/5  rDev -11.6%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 422oz bottle poured into an over sized wine glass. No date on bottle. Thanks to slvrmon82 for giving me the opportunity to try this.
Appearance- Dark orange to light brown in color. Small foamy white head that dissipates rather quickly. Beautiful lacing with large swoops and small dots.
Smell- Tropical fruits. A bit of pineapple, some citrus. Sweet odor.
Taste- Not much different from the smell. A bit of a malty backbone is also present. Not all that dry, a little bit of residual sweetness is noticeable. Pineapple, citrus, caramel...
Mouth/Drink- Full body, good for a DIPA. Very drinkable for a 9.5% abv. Not as dry as I would like, a little too much residual sweetness, but is evened out by the hops. 
Overall good beer. I don't know how old it is and am guessing it is much better when very fresh. Hopefully some day I can have it fresh from the brewery, but for now since they don't put a date on the bottle, this will have to do. 944 charactersdsartwell72, Feb 09, 2011
4.32/5  rDev -1.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4A bitter and sweet, perhaps too sweet, DIPA
---
A: Evening sun yellow/orange body with a fairly persistent one finger white head.
S: Complex blend of American hops... grapefruit, orange, resiny pine, flowers, wet, delicious. A sweet, buttery malt lays low but firm.
T: Bright, resiny hops comes in first, followed by a very sweet, butter-honey malt. This beer is both very sweet and very bitter at the same time, which is a nice trick. All in all, I think there is something a bit cloying about it, which keeps me from awarding the highest honors.
M: Perhaps a touch grainy, but still very good.
D: The hop flavors are absolutely delicious, but the sweet side weights me down a bit. 688 charactersdmfrench, Feb 07, 2011

S: Wow. You can smell the hops right out of the bottle. Citrus, pineapple, mango. It's hard for me to pick out the malt backbone with all of the hop aroma, but as the beer warms, the carmel malts become evident.
T: Everything from the nose, but there's a peppery, spicy quality towards the end that I like. The taste of mango in this beer is terrific. 
M: Full and rich. Has a little bit of an oily quality. Not dry.
D: It's hard for me to not give this one a 5. Alcohol isn't really detectable..beer goes down very easy.

4.73/5  rDev +7.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Shared a bottle with a friend. Poured into a Delirium tulip.
Pours a light orange and amber with a 1 finger head. The smell is of floral apricots and mangos just like the bottle says. The taste is unlike any Double IPA I have ever had. More orange and mangos to compliment the obvious hops. The mouthfeel is silky smooth and probably one of the smoothest beers I have ever had. I cannot believe this beer is 9.5% I would swear it is no more than 6. Everyone trys to compare Hopslam to this beer. While I love Hopslam, Dreadnaught blows it away. I would take this over Hopslam everyday of the week. The best Double IPA I have ever had. 635 charactersmcgwire756, Feb 05, 2011

Almost gold like color with a medium size head that lingers.
Smell is a slightly citrus with hop background.
Taste is smooth and full.
Slight lingering aftertaste of the hops. Not so much as to be unpleasaant but more than I like.
I think this beer suffered by being tasted on the same evening as Hopslam. A very good brew but not as great. 382 charactersjsulko, Feb 05, 2011
4.69/5  rDev +6.8%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Beer poured from a bottle into a Pint glass
A - Beer poured with 1 1/2 finger white colored foam; rocky in appearance and held very well; lacing was great, it stuck to the sides very well; beer has an orange tinge to it and its cloudy in appearance, but has a moderate amount of carbonation to it
S - Citrus and pine hop smells; flowery & fruit (strawberry) esters come up from yeast (which you can see at the bottom of the bottle and glass); malt sweetness coupled with some caramel notes; really solid blend of complex aromas, this is one of the best parts of the beer
T - Malt sweetness, caramel, and fruits that hits you upfront and is immediately followed by a hop bitterness explosion; you can taste the pine/grassy hops; there is almost a sense of deliciousness, my umami buds are going crazy; aftertaste is mild and lingers for a while, in fact, during retro-olfaction I can taste and smell pine, grassy hops
M - Beer feels a bit oily, almost buttery, which makes for a smooth transition down the hatch; slightly effervescent; just a really well-built beer with a fantastic blend of ingredients to get the right balance of taste and feel
D - Overall, just a fantastic drink and definitely one of my favorites; I'm glad I waited this long to try it; I would recommend to other beer lovers; something I must carry in my fridge at all times 1,350 charactersferrari29, Feb 04, 2011

A: Light golden/orange in color with a slight chill haze. Two-inch bubbly white head has decent retention and leaves behind sticky rings of white lacing.
S: Pine, resinous hop oils, mild citrus, mango, tangerine, and a bit of pineapple. Light whiff of a sweet malt base. Good, but a bit weak.
T: Lots of sweet mango, pineapple, white grapes. Substantial resiny pine bitterness rides all the way into the dry finish. Sweet malt base, mild alcohol. There's an odd sweetness to this beer that I can't really pinpoint. It tastes like a sugary mango puree. 
M: Medium bodied, slightly creamy. Decent amount of astringency from the generous hopping.
D: Maybe a tad boozy to be ideally drinkable.
Notes: Chamone, guys. Get with the program. Bottled-on dates would be nice. I have no idea how fresh this was, but I would guess it was a bit past its prime. As it stands I don't see what all the fuss is about. This is a pretty decent DIPA, but nowhere near a top 100 beer. Maybe a fresh bottle would change my opinion. 1,060 charactersryan1788a5, Jan 29, 2011
4.16/5  rDev -5.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4.5APPEARANCE: Poured this 22oz. bomber into a standard 16oz. pint glass. It was a yellowish-straw-like color with a thin, quarter inch head of tiny bubbles resting on top. Gorgeous and thick lacing.
SMELL: Smells a lot like Hopslam, but less intense. Honey, caramel and malt seem to make up the backbone. A bit of mango and citrus are noticable as well, but unlike the bottle claims, I did not notice any peach.
TASTE: Very complex beer. Begins with a punch of hops and then quickly exposes the sweet, honey and caramel malts of the nose. The aftertaste, however, reverts right back to the hops with a bitter and piney flavor. Very odd, but very nice.
MOUTHFEEL: Thin at first, without much feel of carbonation, then, at the very end of the sip it feels and tastes like someone dragged a hop cone across your tongue. Once again, ususual, but still good.
OVERALL: This is not the beer you introduce someone to the style with. It is an intense, complex Double IPA for the professionals. 986 charactersStoneTSR, Jan 28, 2011

Pours a hazy peach-orange with a fingers worth of foamy white head. Some sticky lacing is left behind.
Could smell the hops right after I cracked the cap. Always a good sign. Grapefruit and orange citrus mixed with grassy hops. Sweet malts and a bit of earthiness.
Earthy, sticky, pine-laden hops on the tongue. Grapefruit pith bitterness with bready malts and a good helping of citrus. A well balanced DIPA that finishes with all hops in the aftertaste.
Mouthfeel is that of sticky, resiny, hop juice that still has a decent malt base. Good carbonation and body. Finishes with a nice wave of hop bitterness.
Quite drinkable. Lots of hops with good biterness. Not too malty. Overall, a well executed DIPA and worth seeking out. I don't know if my hand was drawn back to the glass like a few other DIPA's I've had, but this beer definitely deserves to be in the top 10 DIPA's on BA. Good stuff. 930 characterssisuspeed, Jan 27, 2011
4.4/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to PaulV for this bottle! Poured into a fluted pint, revealing hazy golden brown body with a finger and a half of airy yellowed head. A little lacing. Smells nice and hoppy with a strong honey floral presence and some fresh pear, maybe some dried mango. Little bits of rich, caramel-y meatiness underneath.
Tastes mad hoppy with a strong peppery bitterness tempered well with the grassy, citrusy character and held up by a decently thick and meaty malt backbone. Not too sweet but sweet enough to be smooth. Pretty much the perfect balance of sweet and bitterness to be very drinkable. Medium-bodied with a creamy carbonation and a slight drying after some sips.
Overall I like it quite a bit. I am lucky to live around two of my favorite DIPAs but I'm sure I could get by with bottles of this if I were from the midwest. I'd encourage people to try it! 862 charactersabuliarose, Jan 26, 2011
4.25/5  rDev -3.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Poured from a 22oz bottle into a tulip.
A - Pours a slightly murky, golden orange with a creamy white head leaving a decent lace on the glass.
S - Before the pour, the aromas coming out of the bottle are amazing. Huge hop burst with light notes of caramel. Once poured into my glass, i get a bit more of that maltiness which i come to expect from the style, but hops, mostly citrus, grapefruit, orange peel and pineapple dominate.
T - Wonderfully balanced. Malty backbone with great bitterness. Great tastes of pine resin, grapefruit, pineapple and even some mango. This is definitely a world class IIPA!
M - Medium body, with medium carbonation. Somewhat of a syrupy feel to it, but i would not call it creamy. Juicy and crisp at the end with a nice semi dry finish and a light to moderate bitterness.
D - This is a very drinkable beer, duh! I'm finding the high ABV masked rather well due to the the delicate balance this beer attained. I wish this was more readily available on the west coast. Since its not, i'll have to stick to pliny, poor me ;) 1,056 charactersdubinsky, Jan 24, 2011

4.22/5  rDev -3.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.522oz bottle provided by UMNbeerhunter, thanks Joe! Poured into a Dogfish Head Signature glass.
A - Pours a very clear goldenrod body, with some slight amber in the thickest parts of the glass. It slowly but surely builds about 1.5 fingers worth of rocky, off-white head with pretty low retention. An absolute torrent of carbonation can be seen rushing from the nucleation point to the top, quick and numerous. Some spotty lacing appears after the head dissipates.
S - The smell is full of fruits and pine, a great combination. I am getting lots of grapefruit, orange, mango, and pineapple. All this beer needs is a little frilly umbrella and the tropical scene is complete. There is some wet pine smell as well, beautifully showcasing the hop profile of this beer. Delicious smelling.
T - Given the awesome smell of this beer, I was expecting a ton of flavor, and while this beer certainly boasts a ton of hops, I feel the nose does a much better job of displaying them. While it's possible to get the slight tropical fruits, this beer, like many other (D)IPAs, tends to sway towards the orange and grapefruit bitterness. I am not sure of the age of this beer, so the date could definitely have an impact, but I can't say either way. Given that, this is a great beer, but I thought the nose built it up to be incredible. The fruits have a way of contributing to while cutting the bitterness a bit, and the pine arises to add an extra complexity. The malt backbone is comprised of some nice caramel support. Finish is long and bitter.
M - Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with high carbonation. Great mouthfeel, sticky hops leave a thick coating on the mouth, and contribute to the long finish.
D - Drinkability is high. Easy to drink and has all the right components to a good time. Had no problem finishing a bomber of this over the course of a Penguins game. 1,859 charactersnhindian, Jan 21, 2011
4.37/5  rDev -0.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to Agold for this trade, and the chance to try this amazing beer. Poured into my Dfh snifter, appearance is a dark yellow/orange color, about 1 finger of head quickly dies down with nice glass lacing. On the nose, there are some huge aromatic grapefruit flavors, as well as pine, and some nice tropical fruits and citrus. On the first taste, the fresh grapefruit and citrus flavors flavors mingle, along with some nice bitter hops, followed by a creamy malt at the end. This is a truly amazing beer, a great specimen of a double ipa. For the big abv, it is really hidden well, and this is highly drinkable. Bravo three floyds! 633 characterslnashsig, Jan 17, 2011
3.71/5  rDev -15.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 3.5Giant three finger head off the pour into a pint glass. Huge retention on it, this thing just WILL not go away very impressive off white color and very foamy. Some faint cloudiness but not much, with a nice golden dark brown color body. This is a very impressive looking beer.
Smell is a primary hops obviously, and airy chew, but a faint fruit that is hard to discern and pinpoint. There is not a lot of fruit smell on this beer, it's mostly just hops and it's nearly impossible to detect the citrus and so called tropical fruits that the bottle claims. 
Taste is typical but tolerable hops that are not too bitter. But missing big notes of fruit with only a slight faint orange on the finish. The mouthfeel on this beer though is truly exceptional, it is extremely pillow and fluffy like in the mouth it feels great. There is also a strange ashen (ashes) like quality to this beer which is just weird.
This is a decent beer but I am not blown away by it at all and it's hard to find in my area and pricey. I would not pay a lot of money to have this again, and I would easily grab a Dogfish 90 or the Burton Baton over this. 1,129 characterssmakawhat, Jan 17, 2011

4.12/5  rDev -6.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Hazy straw colored pour with some carbonation flowing and a short, but staying off-white head. It leaves a good web of lacing.
I can smell hops from where I stand. Lots of citrus, like a Florida fruit basket. There is grapefruit, orange, mangoes, peaches, and a hint of watermelon. 
Nice spice bite of hops sweetness then bitters followed by a big lemon burst and orange peel. The hint of bread-like yeast is nice along with some subtle honey malt notes which keeps the sweetness while the hop character balances with its tartness.
The tongue tickles with bubbles as it dries out a bit. A little sticky sweetness is still present, however, making this an almost sessionable IIPA. 679 charactersManVersusBeer, Jan 14, 2011

5/5  rDev +13.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This is my second review of Dreadnaught, easily a desert Island beer for me, and possibly the beer I would drink last before I die (though Vanilla Bean Dark Lord probably would be it if available). Certainly it is my favorite beer that is easily available year round. I was INCREDIBLY fortunate enough to be given a growler of Dread that was tapped the day before from my beer guy in DC. I feel it is my duty to tell the beer world that you must try Dreadnaught on tap (fresh) or from a fresh growler to really appreciate this amazing beer. 
The beer pours great with sticky lacing and a perfect orange hue characteristic on DIPA's, with a nice white head. 
The smell might almost be the best part. Huge aroma of grapefruit, tropical fruit hops, notes of pine hops, candied malt, tangerine, and more waft effortlessly from the glass in such an open and dank way. Just so much hops in there but all of it with a beautiful fruit tinge and with some sweet malt to back it up. 
The taste follows the flavor almost exactly, which I'm finding as I review more beers is becoming more rare. This beer does not disappoint and opens up a completely balanced flavor with absolutely no flaws or flavors that completely dominate. All the notes of tropical fruit, grapefruit, dank pine hops, sweeter bready malts, bitters and sweetness, and more all get along very well. Hops up front, malt and fruit in the middle, and a bittersweet end that lingers a long time. 
Mouthfeel is great, it's so smooth and awesome. The creaminess is there with just enough carbonation. This is so great. Drinkability? I could drink this all day because the alcohol is hardly detectable at all, its completely sugar coated and pleasant, no burn is here AT ALL. 
I had this growler next to a bottles of the best bottles Hop beers available right now (including two seasonals from great beer companies, two really great beers) and there was no contest. Granted, from a growler will always be better than a bottle for me, but still the Dreadnaught is just such a well crafted beer. What can I say, my handle even pays homage to this beer! 2,106 charactersDreadnaught33, Jan 13, 2011
4.19/5  rDev -4.6%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.522oz bottle into snifter.
Pours a fairly clear golden, with faint orange hues and quickly rising carbonation and an average white head.
The aroma is of big citric and tropical fruity hops lending a fair amount of bitterness.
The taste is again of sweet tropical fruit such as pineapple, mango and grapefruit. I picked up just a faint caramel backing from the malts and quite faint alcohol.
The mouthfeel is medium bodied with smooth carbonation.
This is a well done and very enjoyable DIPA. If it were available locally I would probably pick it up, though I probably won't go out of my way to acquire it again. 615 charactersvkv822, Jan 12, 2011

This is definitely a hophead's dream beer without the bitterness. Pours a cloudy amber appearance. Opening salvo of mango, peach and citrus hop aromas that sit atop a pronounced caramel malt backbone. This beer retained a nice head and lace throughout. It's complex flavors is both smooth and memorable. A definite favorite of mine in the Imperial IPA category! 476 charactersCuriousMonk, Jan 11, 2011
4.67/5  rDev +6.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A: Slightly hazy, yellow-straw colored hue; a thin but steady head; lacing isn't as intricate and complex as many DIPAs but it's okay
S: Wow! Lots of tropical citrus fruits from the hops; a grainy undertone; maybe a touch of bubblegum also from the hop presence
T: Tropical fruit: grapefruit, mango, pineapple, and bubble gum; alcohol numbing quality on the back of the tongue and roof of the mouth; slightly grainy undertones--man, this is tropical hop goodness!
F: Actually quite creamy for the style; the beer sits so nicely on the roof of the mouth
D: A great, wonderful and easy to drink DIPA; I can't believe it's nearly 10%--the alcohol presence is there but it's subtle and not overwhelming at all 709 charactersdbossman, Jan 10, 2011

Pours a lightly hazed amber with pale straw highlights. Medium carbonation. Decent finger of soapy head forms and sticks around for a couple sips. Nice, sticky lacing. Aromas are fainter than expected, and a little thin. Some of the typical grapefruit and caramel notes, and some vanilla in there as well. Nothing unique or even robust about it. A slight disappointment thus far. Flavor makes up for it, though. There is a slight laundry detergent quality to it that is a put off. It's right upfront and not well hidden. Other than that flaw, the hops are well-balanced. This is the Midwest version of a Western IPA. It lacks the insane Hop Power of a Lefty DIPA. Instead, it pushes some nice, caramel malty notes into the mix and makes it a better balanced brew. There's a really sweet character to this that is intriguing, though I doubt I could drink too many of these because of it. It's almost like a young barleywine in texture and malt character. The finish, is super long - longer than John Holmes. And it's drier than expected, so this beer is very complex. Very good. 9.5% ABV is really well masked, no idea it was that potent. Worth tracking down, folks. Great take on the DIPA.
What I like most: The super well-masked ABV and complex and well-balanced flavor profile (except for the detergent taste upfront).
What I like least: The nonexistent aroma profile.
Verdict: very good beer, worth tracxking down but not elite. 1,632 charactersSolomonGrundy, Jan 09, 2011
4.67/5  rDev +6.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to rfraga77 for sending me this one a day after it was bottled straight form the FFF source. I drank this as fresh as a Californian could, within a 7 day window from being bottled:
Appearance - Looks like a standard DIPA with a thick body you can see in the RRBC pint glass I pour it in - Good but not the brighter color I look for.
Smell - Heavenly. Tons of citrus focusing on mango primarily, apricots and peaches with a very familiar "Herbal" thing blending in nicely. DANK.
Taste - Straight Dank in a glass. Very much so reminds me of Marijuana, moreso than a fresh Racer 5 which is impressive.
Very much follows the smell and the stickiness from the hops resinates the palate, lingering long after each sip. Bright citris, solid malt backbone. This beer fresh hangs with all the big boys in the WC. 
Mouthfeel - A little thick but not syrupy. The body tells you it's around 9% and that it's without doubt a DIPA but that's what this beer was meant to be and what I believe FFF was aiming for. The resinous hops leave you wanting another sip over and over. I had to slow down some to relax and appreciate all its qualities.
Drinkability - Good. A bit thick but no DIPA can drink like PtE now can it? No problem finishing the bomber.
Final Thoughts - This is one fantastic DIPA. I've had this a few times and always thought it was good but at this fresh, it's truly World Class and I now can see what all the fuss is about. Pricing still high IMHO however. I put this up in my top 5 DIPAs along with:

Aromas of wet hay, tropical fruit, grapefruit rind, green hops, and brown sugar. 
Taste is a sweet and sour mixture of malt sugars and grapefruit. Some tropical flavors in the background, like mango. There is a nice green hoppy finish as well.
Body is medium with nice carbonation, producing a creamy mouthfeel. 
This is an interesting DIPA, the flavors and palate are both superb. The alcohol is well matched by the flavor. A very good beer to pair with seafood. 596 charactersBeerenauslese, Jan 06, 2011

The color is a nice amber-gold with a fine, cream colored foam that rises quickly and falls slowly. Aromas are heavy with pine, bold citrus fruits, white flower petals, and a grassy punch. Flavor is intense to match. Big flavor impact with grapefruit and a bready mid palate. Finish lingers for minutes with a hop overload. A gripping bitter finish that leaves your cheeks drained of moisture and your tongue yearning for another drop. What a treat.

The flavors open with citrus hops over sweet caramel. The hangs around for a while, and eventually gives way to a lingering grapefruit and pine bitterness.

Bottle to pint
App- An orangy yellow with a very pencil thin head. Nice lacing as the beer goes down.
Smell- One hell of a hoppy note. A very upfront smell with some big citrus and a minimal spice.
Taste- This is not as earthy as a west coast DIPA and I think being a mid westerner at heart I am biased. I liked this a lot. Has a nice crisp clean flavor I was hoping for but not over powering.
Mouth- A bit of a medium body but a nice crispness to the bite of it with a clean finish.
Drink- I'm not on the Pliny bandwagon and I think this was slightly higher in my opinion. I appreciate the Imperial DIPA style and like what people try to do with them. I think I need to go visit the family in IL and make a trip to 3Floyds. 748 charactersFosterJM, Jan 04, 2011

T: Smooth on the front with a medium to heavy bite on the back end. There is also slight grapefruit and floral taste.
M: Surprisingly thin with a punch of what I think is carbonation.
D: It was tough for me to finish the bottle. I am not a huge IPA fan so my review really shouldn't count against this beer, but I thought this particular IPA was nothing out of the ordinary. I would drink it again, but I would not actively seek it out. 537 charactersstbo101, Jan 03, 2011

A - Poured lemony/orange (if such a thing exists) with a huge white head that left serious lacing on my pint glass after the pour. 
S - Good hop bit with the ususal grapefruit citrus bite in the nose. 
T - Very nice considering not my favorite style. Good taste of pine, citrus, and a pretty hoppy bite. I don't drink the style enough to be an expert for comparison purposes, but the hop bite was more bitter than oily which I get in other more aggressive IPA's. 
M - Pretty good, clean and crisp with a big ending bite.
D - For me, I liked it as a balance to the turkey chili that I was having. Nice combination which played off each other. Done my chili, done my beer.
I should have picked up a couple more of these when I had the opportunity. A nice solid mainstay of FFF. 878 charactersBeerisheaven, Jan 02, 2011

4.53/5  rDev +3.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Pours a golden orange color with a very slight haze to it. An inch of eggshell colored head sits atop and leaves a fair amount of lacing as it slowly fades.
The nose is loaded with citrus and some floral hops, but is balanced nicely with some sweet caramel-like malts.
Following suit from the nose, the taste is a perfectly balanced blend of hops and malts. Some red grapefruit and pineapple hit the tongue first, but before the thought of this being a huge hop bomb enters your mind, the sweet caramel malts enter the scene to balance things out. This is definitely one of the best tasting DIPAs I've had.
Mouth feel is smooth, almost creamy, and the carbonation is spot on for the style. This beer is insanely drinkable...I honestly did not want to put my glass down! I wish I could get this in KS or MO on a regular basis, but it will have to be one I pick up whenever I make it to WI, IL, or anywhere else that Three Floyds distributes. 943 charactersratedz, Dec 29, 2010
4.1/5  rDev -6.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5I can't believe this is my first review of Dreadnaught since I've had it a bunch of times both out of the bottle and on tap. It pours a muddied, murky dark orange with a one finger white foamy head. It smells of subtle citrusy hops, dry, and of sweet malt. The taste is a little piny followed by a good amount of overly sweet malt. I must've grabbed a bottle that had sit for awhile. It drinks both crisp and exceptionally smooth, especially for an IPA. I think that this one is better on tap but it is still pretty good out of a bottle. It's definitely worth trying but I think that Apocalypse Cow is better. 609 charactersaasher, Dec 28, 2010
4.56/5  rDev +3.9%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5From notes:
Pours a dark ruby/golden orange color with burnt orange hues when held to a light source and a two finger frothy, pillowy white foam head. Excellent retention, only slowly fading into a lasting cap that lingers throughout the entire glass and coats the pint with large chunks of soapy lacing.
Dank, resinous hop aroma with lots of earthy pine and citrus fruit notes. Hints if grapefruit, pineapple and lemon peel as well as pine needle and sunlte malt presence that takes away from the hops slightly.
Chewy full body with lots of uber fresh dank, oily hop flavor. Plenty of sweet citrus fruit notes as well as earthy bitter pine flavorthat the aroma suggested. Hints of grapefruit, pineapple, mango and lemon peel. The malt backbone is present and provides nice balance but isn't as prominent as the aroma suggests. There is a sligt lactic/creamy quality mid-palate that makes this beer extremely quaffable. The perfect balance of bitter, floral, sweet and slight malt. The ABV is excellently masked and there is a bitter dry finish. One of the best IPAs I've ever had. 1,084 characterscorby112, Dec 28, 2010

Slightly hazy golden orange with a one finger white head that fades to a collar with excellent lacing. Smell is sweet and fruity hops, pineapple, guava, sweet and buttery malts. Taste is bitter up front, slightly sweet with a touch of fruity hop flavors. After the incredible hop aroma I am slightly disappointed with the lack of complexity in the taste.

4.47/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Big Thanks to TCGoalie for bringing this bad boy back from Munster
Pours a nice, fairly clear medium amber color with a nice orange hue to it. My normal pour yields a pretty small light tan head that fades fairly quickly, but leaves a stubborn ring of foam and tons of lace.
Even though this bottle has been waiting for me a couple months, the smell is still nice and hoppy. It has a slightly tropical sort of hop character with some juicy pineapple and mango. There is also a big helping of ruby red grapefruit and pine. I am also detecting a solid malt presence that has a sugary honey character to it, and perhaps also just a hint of alcoholic warmth.
The flavor is incredibly complex, much more so than I had expected. Hops cascade down upon my tongue, with plenty of that juicy citrus and tropical character that was in the nose, but with a bit more pine. Intermingled with all the pineapple, grapefruit and mango is a healthy malt backbone that carries notes of honey, caramel and a touch of toasted malt. There is some serious bitterness in this beer that keeps it from finishing too sweet. Yum.
The mouthfeel is on the fuller side of the medium spectrum, with pretty much the perfect amount of carbonation. It finishes well for being such a big beer, with a slight coating quality that is a bit sticky, but at the same time super dry. Dank hops dominate the finish.
This beer is super drinkable and goes down amazingly well for its size. It is obvious that TCGoalie took good care of this before getting it to me, and it tastes amazing. I will be moving back to the Midwest soon and I am looking forward to taking a trip down to FFF to try and get my hands on some that is even fresher. 1,698 characterszoso1967, Dec 18, 2010

Smell is not as strong as I expected, I hope this bottle is fresh. Unfortunately there is no bottling code or date. I feel underwhelmed. There seems to be some fruitiness happening, but I can't decipher what it is because it's beaten down by the alcohol. A little malt is present as well... My guess is this bottle is 3-4 months old, although I'm not sure because I've never had it before.
The taste is very disappointing coming from such a renowned beer. I'm getting a very strong alcohol taste that is overpowering most of the hop flavor up front. The middle is better, some of the fruity hops come into play. The end is creamy and well-blended, leaves a nice aftertaste. 
Not one of the best DIPAs I've had, despite it's status. I hope to try this again with a proven-fresh bottle. 858 charactersEstocker, Dec 15, 2010
4.22/5  rDev -3.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Cracked open a bomber that I had just recently received in a trade. Drank from Duvel tulip. After a rough pour, the beer settled down with a dense finger and a half of frothy eggshell-white foam. The foam settled in somewhat quickly, leaving moderate lacing on the glass. The beer was a honey-copper color, with trace streams of co2 bubbles racing upwards in the glass.
The smell was intensely filled with citrus notes, particularly grapefruit. It was like someone had placed a hunk of freshly peeled grapefruit rind under my nose. There was a spicy/peppery pineyness to it as well. A slight bit of sweet maltiness was present.
Tastes from the first gulp matched the nose squarely. It was like taking a bit from a bitter grapefruit up front, then the sweeter tropical citrus flavors come into play. There is a very pleasant sweet maltiness, and it finishes with a mild hop fueled bitterness. The beer is very creamy and feels luxurious in the mouth, has a medium body and a lingering bitterness. This was a very well crafted DIPA. 1,032 characterssurlytheduff, Dec 14, 2010

I have been wanting to try this one for a while and boy am I glad I did. This hazy orange-tangerine coloured elixir pours well with a nice white rocky head and sticky lacing. The smell is a bouquet of citric fruits with noticeable piney hops. The taste is amazing, tonnes of fruits, peach, orange peel, tangerine, grapefruit. The sweet, yet mild malt, is in the background but supports well. Medium mouthfeel with amazing balance. This beer rocks and I would love to drink as many as I can!

Aroma is very citrusy/fruity - pineapples and grapefruit absolutely beautiful nose. Taste is very bitter but is well "balanced" by the malty flavors too. Palate is one of this beer's strongest points - Smooth and silky at first - it lets the fruity flavors develop before ending in a well carbonated, dry, hop kick in the mouth finish. I don't like IIPAs very much, but this is a work of art. 499 charactersLuk13, Dec 11, 2010
4.5/5  rDev +2.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Tried this one on a rare beer night tasting with some BA friends during September 2010. Thanks troywhittaker for bring and sharing this rare find for us FL folks. 
I need to take some more detailed notes on this one ate a future time, but here is a high level review for my future reference.
Appearance pours a copper orange color with a fluffy head and impressive lacing.
Aromas of the full hop spectrum. Citrus, grapefruit, pine, spice. Tastes as it smell with a solid hop bitterness and equal maltbackbone with solid caramel malt support.
Full bodied mouthfeel for an IPA, the malt support shows through in the full body.
Look fwd to trying this one again, enjoyable for sure, often described as very citrus hop profile, I look fwd to researching this again on a future fresh tasting. 790 charactersunclejimbay, Dec 08, 2010

4.42/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5I poured this 22 oz. bottle into a Chimay goblet.
A: clear orange-amber color, one-finger white head quickly falls into a thin cap, good lacing.
S: grapefruit, more grapefruit, and even more grapefruit, also mango, peach, and orange blossom.
T: the mango and peach mingle with the citrus notes up front, and then the middle unleashes a torrent of Texas ruby red grapefruit and sweet, biscuit-like malt, the finish is grassy with pine undertones.
M: medium bodied, oily, moderate carbonation, very drying, bracing.
D: this is a very tasty and balanced Imperial IPA, and ranks up there with the very best of this style. 622 charactersErish, Dec 05, 2010
4.77/5  rDev +8.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Appearance- Pours a clear golden to copper color with a chunky 2 two finger head. Good retention and good lacing all the way down the glass.
Smell- Hops fill the room upon opening the bottle. Lots of tropical fruits and citrus hops. Some pine notes when you stick your nose in it, but it is mostly citrus and floral.
Taste- Citrus hops on the outset, with a small caramel malt backbone in the middle. Finishes fruity and bitter. Notes of peach, pineapple, apricot, grapefruit... It is not super dry which is nice, bitter yes, but still juicy in the mouth.
Mouthfeel- Smooth and creamy. Not too "oily" like some DIPAs can be.
Overall- Great DIPA. I would put this up against anything out there. 697 charactersJLeege, Dec 04, 2010

S-light notes of caramel and doughy malts up front but very faint as the hops dominate. Tons of citrus fruits, plenty of grapefruit, notes of mango and tangerine. Hop explosion and still has notes of malt body.
T-the taste is just as good, this has the malt presence with notes of resignous piney hops, the citrus takes over and doesn't let go. pineapple, tangerines, mango. This is good stuff!
M-medium body, very creamy on the palate, syrupy feel to it, the body isn't as huge as the sticky feel would imply. rather juicy with strong carbonation and a crisp semi dry finish and a light to moderate bitterness.
D-hop explosion with hints of balance but no where near detracting from the juicy citrus flavors. the bitterness is there and lingers slightly but it is lighter and not over powering at all. great stuff, I do enjoy a dreadnaught! 941 characterscpetrone84, Dec 03, 2010

Acquired in my first trade with Joel6615. Thanks again Joel, got to try a lot of amazing beers that are even hard to get in San Diego.
A: Pours an apricot-orange with tight carbonation and forms a sudsy, cavernous, 1-1/2 inch head in the pint glass. Retention is phenomenal - as it slowly recedes, thick, layered lacing is caked on the side of the glass.
S: Starts with a big whiff of tropical and citrus esters and honey-sweet malts. The alcohol jumps right out at you, carrying the layers of scent. As hoppy as this beer is famed to be, the nose carries huge malt character.
T: The hop blast immediately meets your palate with bitter, citrusy grapefruit and layers of tropical fruit. Lots of subtleties in the front of the sip including mango, peaches and an earthy tea-like hop-bite. The sweet malts quickly balance things out and they're equally prominent. Strong notes of honey and buttered sweetbread are big enough to handle the hop onslaught, and the alcohol is right there to spice things up. The brew is balanced, bold and delicious on your palate - it finishes this way with little lingering residue.
M: Rich and full-bodied as any good DIPA should be, but the ample carbonation really lightens things up - even more than anticipated. The beer is far from over-carbonated, but it's a lot less sticky than expected.
D/N: This is exactly what I was hoping for and, given the hype, expecting. A full-flavored, layered, complex but balanced DIPA that has a similar hop profile to the many samplings you'll find along the West Coast. Went down way too easy given the ABV, but that's what happens when layers of flavor are nicely aligned. Great brew. 1,702 charactersrand, Dec 02, 2010
4.55/5  rDev +3.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Dreadnaught poured a more yellow than red shade of amber with a very thick white head that eventually dissipated into a soft cap of foam. Lacing was pretty impressive.
The aroma is literally making my mouth water. Besides loads of grapefruit and orange rind, I'm getting peach, pinapple, pine, and plenty of bready malts to sweeten things up. After a few sips, I notice an earthy funk towards the end of the bouquet. Its not a bad thing. Its just something I've never noticed before. If anything, it just adds to the complexity.
I've had this beer several times before and its always a pleasure. This time is no different. Playing along with the aroma, bales of juicy citrus and pine hops integrate with buckets of sweet biscuity malts. I absolutely love the balance here and I can't say that I've had a better tasting IIPA. Don't get me wrong, pure bitter hop bombs have a place in the beer world. I love a face full of bitter from time to time. But this provides that with the added bonus of an unbreakable malt backbone.
Mouthfeel is good. Carbonation is just right. Its not quite as sticky as I like my Imperials to be, but thats a very minor detractor.
Drinkabiltiy is tricky on this one. Theres no way I could session this due to ABV, however, the flavor wouldn't hold me back a bit. One bomber is a walk in the park.
If you like IIPAs, get some. Drink it. Smile. 1,374 charactersBetmore, Dec 01, 2010
4.33/5  rDev -1.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5A - Pours a lovely golden straw color with a big foamy head that sticks around. Looks great!
S - Big citrusy aroma with a touch of sugary sweetness. Not quite my ideal aroma, but damn close.
T - This bottle might be a bit old. Hops are not what's overwhelming here. It's a bit of tomato juice, the same sugary sweetness from the nose, and then some grapefruity bitter hops. Not bad, pretty complex, but not what I look for in an Imperial IPA
M - A bit astringent, creamy feel. Interesting.
D - Each sip begs for another. 524 charactersColdPoncho, Dec 01, 2010
4.02/5  rDev -8.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Three Floyds Dreadnaught IPA is actually a Double IPA and a BA top 20 beer. The beer when opened smells like tearing the rind off of a plump florida grapefruit. The beer is a orange-red amber with a good tuff of soapy white foam that clings and stays. The smell is very fruity with citrus notes as well as other more delicate notes like pear and mango. The beer is enamel stripping bitter and it coats my mouth and tongue like microscopic fiberglass shards. There is plenty of malty caramel sweetness, but it's a bit too much with the clinging bitterness that it makes for an unpleasant aftertaste. The mouthfeel is good with fine, soft carbonation but this is difficult to drink much more than the 7-8 oz pour I got from a bomber split 3 ways. 744 charactersSoonami, Nov 29, 2010
4.15/5  rDev -5.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4A- Pours a nice bright orange color with a white head a even lace.
S- Smell of peach and mango tones with hops and a caramel malt in the background.
T-Taste the hops and mango and peaches not to much of the grapefruit bite very well balance and a sweet caramel malt in the background. Invites me to keep taking sips.
M- Moist a little on the semi-dry side but with flavors that are not so bold and strong but very noticeable and with the malt aftertaste it's not to bad works pretty good.
D- Overall this IPA is up there as in terms of taste with the nice tropical flavors other then just the strong grapefruit bite that I normally taste in other ipa's. Seem there's a cool balance with flavors and even though I like my ipa with very very little malt but this works well. All should try this beer once.

4.5/5  rDev +2.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.522oz bottle poured into pint glass. thanks to crushedvol
Pours a copper orange with a huge, frothy head which retains very well. Plenty of carbonation and curtains of lacing around the glass. 
A strong pine aroma fills the room while pouring. After a deeper breath, some tropical fruit and malt sweetness mix in. Apricots, citrus, and faint pineapple are all there. 
The beginning is an absolute hop explosion of oily pine with a slight juiciness. Heavy grapefruit citrus with some invigorating zest and orange follow immediately. A smaller malt backbone with touches of caramel and toasted bread hides towards the middle with some sweetness. Tropical fruit pokes through towards the end before another splash of piny hop bitterness and a dash of warm alcohol. 
Medium to fuller body, decent carbonation, some dryness in the feel. which doesn't linger too long. Pretty drinkable for a 9.5% DIPA, and the flavor profile is aggressive, yet incredibly well executed. This is awesome. 984 charactersxnicknj, Nov 27, 2010

A: Pours a nice copper color with about a finger of fluffy white head. Good amount of foamy lace sticks to the sides of the glass.
S: A nice dose of sweet malts mixed with strong pine aromas. Hints of citrus mixed in as well. 
T: A lot of caramel malt sweetness upfront transitions into a bitter hop finish. The finish features nice notes of earth and pine. 
M: It's on the full side of medium body. Nice and smooth with subtle carbonation in the finish. 
D: A really well done DIPA. I'm not sure it makes me want to run to Indiana to get more, but very tasty. I will reserve final judgment until I have some fresh. 706 charactersMrDanno96, Nov 25, 2010
4.13/5  rDev -5.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Opened this bottle last weekend with CooperEllis, a solid BA who finds a way to get me passed out every time we review beers together. I'll have to bring that up some time. Maybe today when we do it again.
This beer pours a murky bronze/amber that produces a great susaining head. A tasty head too. The smell is of strong citrus hops, with a touch of malt. It tastes the same way, with a strong hops presence throughout. But it's not too strong, and the entire beer is well-composed. A truly smooth IPA. 
Mouthfeel is solid, as there's great carbonation and the body is solid. It's a drinkable one, but without a doubt imperial, so be careful. Or figure out how to blame your drinking buddy for pouring you more. 714 charactersafksports, Nov 21, 2010

Pours a yellow-amber with a little bit of haze to it. Nice fluffy 2 finger off white head, with solid retention and some decent lacing. Smell is amazing. Huge tropical fruits, with juicy grapefruit and orange, and some lemon. Only a hint of pine. 
Taste is nice as well. Again, tropical fruits. Orange. Juicy grapefruit. Lemon and pine in the background. Actually starts off with a slight sweetness from the grain bill, which gives way to the delicious hop profile. 628 charactersHURTemHIZZY, Nov 19, 2010

A - a beautiful apple juice golden color with a 1/2inch fluffy white head on top.
S - a ton of floral and citrus hops dominate this nose, with some wheat and maybe a hint of honey.
T - BOOM! A hop explosion wakes up my palate with delicious dry, tangy awesomeness. It smooths out in the middle and finishes with more hops as it's swallowed down. 
M - great carbonation and a ton of flavorful hops are making my mouth very happy right now.
D - a delicious IIPA that I would definitely drink more of if it were readily available here. 631 charactersGabrielM, Nov 18, 2010

Lacing continues nicely down the glass (ky ale snifter) very hoppy aroma. Nice citric combined with piney, bright and floral aromas. Taste just as bold as it smells. Grapefruit, slightly lemony and piney flavors. Bitter dry finish as expected, but leaves you unsettled wanting another sip. Very fresh and
drinkable for the level of beer, could definitely sneak up and get you if you aren't careful. Great all-around beer, which is to be expected of three floyds, they never disappoint, an also as usual, the artwork for their bottle is just as awesome. 632 charactersdespainmakesbeer, Nov 14, 2010
4.24/5  rDev -3.4%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured from a 22oz. bottle into a New Belgium globe. Beer was a hazy orange color, with a very thick and creamy, two-finger tan head. Moderate carbonation and thick lacing around the glass.
Aroma was citrus, caramel, pine, wood ad mango. Aroma is fantastic. You can almost taste it. Fortunately, I'll be tasting it in a minute. 
Taste was big bitter hops, caramel, some citrus and wood notes. I think my tongue just got beat up by a gang of hops. Very nice flavor overall. 
Long, bitter finish. Somewhat syrupy mouthfeel and pretty dry overall. 
Excellent beer. Well made and delish. 587 charactersdrumrboy22, Nov 13, 2010

Thanks to taiyed for sharing this bottle!
It's taken me way too long to try this brew. It pours a slightly hazed bright amber topped by a finger of white micro-foam. The nose comprises honeydew, watermelon, pine, sweet caramel, and mandarin oranges. The taste starts off with a small sortie of sharp pine and mint flavor fighters, which then dovetails into a mild carpet bombing raid by slightly minty caramel bombers. The lack of hop intensity leads us to think this may be an old bottle (without dates, we'll never truly know)...or that people are imagining hops that aren't there. Still, despite this, it is a pretty nice flavor. The body is a stolid medium, with a light carbonation and a dry, kinda sticky feel. Overall, a solid DIPA, not one of my favorites but one that can still hold its own against many challengers. 868 charactersTMoney2591, Nov 13, 2010

Thanks to taiyed for bringing this to the party so that I don't have to buy it myself.
I first must say before I plug in all of my notes here, that this beer is past it's prime and I don't know what date it was from. That having been said...This beer pours a hazy golden orange with a frothy white foam head. There is still a wonderful piny aroma mixed with the citrus of oranges and lemon. The flavor still has some bitterness from the hops, but the general flavor has long since left the building. I shall assume the age is at fault for the balance that exists between malt and hop here. This beer is pretty good on the palate and drinks well. A good beer if you can get it, a great beer if you can get it fresh. 757 charactersVdubb86, Nov 12, 2010

4.62/5  rDev +5.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5A- Pours dark orange/light red color. Thick two-fingered head that last quite awhile in the tulip. Brilliant, slow moving carb bubbles. The lacing is sticky with this one...every sip reveals where the beer has been on your glass with a solid (not broken up) ring around it.
S- Grapefruit aroma initially....all tropical citrusy smells really. Wonderful.
T- Pungent hop profile. "Fresh." Sweet caramel malt...mouthwatering dankness. This is the stuff beer legends are made of. Boozy enough to let you know you're not drinking God's tears, or maybe you are. Dank the dark lord for this beer...I know not what that means but I meant every world of it!
M- Rich, creamy. You know, all the good mouthfeel adjectives.
D/O- Normally I deduct slightly on DIPAs in this category but the alcohol is so hidden and the beer is so delicious I think a lot of people would try to take down more (2? 3? bombers) than they should. Wow. Hats off to Three Floyds...my favorite style of beer, this is the best DIPA I've had thusfar...so does that mean this is now my favorite beer? It just may be. 1,080 charactersDuff27, Nov 10, 2010

Three Floyds continues to show their expertise in hoppy beers with this gem. 350 charactersshodrod, Nov 09, 2010
4.64/5  rDev +5.7%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4brian44556 set me up with this one in a trade we did a few weeks ago. I have heard a lot of good things about Three Floyds, and I have been looking forward to drinking this one.
The beer pours a slightly hazy copper orange with a creamy one finger white head. The beer did travel from Kentucky, so some of the haziness may come from traveling UPS. After a few minutes the head fades to a small thin ring. The aroma is fantastic! I'm initially hit with fresh tart grapefruit, orange, tangerine, mango and pineapple. I wouldn't have expected all of these aromas to come off so distinct and fresh, but they do and are very inviting.
The first sip is everything I could have hoped for and expected from that aroma. Bitter grapefruit is the first flavor that shows up, and then I'm hit with oranges and those tropical fruits. In the end there is almost a pithy flavor which makes it feel like they actually ground up a grapefruit and threw it in the bottle. The beer is rich and creamy on the tongue with just enough carbonation.
This is one of those beers with tons of hype surrounding it, but this one lives up to the expectations unlike many others. The flavors are so fresh and crisp! Somewhere in this beer they hid 9%+ alcohol, but I haven't been able to find it. I sure wish Three Floyds distributed to Pennsylvania, but at least I have a friend in Kentucky who is willing to trade for this fantastic beer. 1,411 charactersjlandis, Nov 08, 2010
4.52/5  rDev +3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5I've been searching for this beer for over five years, being I'm on the East Coast, Three Floyds stuff is really hard to find. 'Finally found some while on a Chicago business trip recently, ended up bringing (3) bottles home.
A - Pours a clear dark orange color with mild carbonation and a very thin, finely bubbled, white creamy ring.
S - The nose is dripping with ripe pineapple, juicy orange, mango, spices, and some pine. The bouquet is dominated by tropical fruit with any malt pushed far in the background.
T - Vibrant tropical fruit throughout with mild malt undertones. The bitter hopping hits the front of the tongue immediately and lingers long after it's past the gums and down the throat. Pine, grapefruit, and other citrus fruit dance around the tongue. Right away I noticed a spicey warming in the back of the throat as it makes it way down and continues a warming effect for several minutes afterwards. Long lingering orange metallic coating in the mouth. 
M - medium bodied with mildly moderate carbonation on the tongue. Lip smacking sticky on the lips. 
D - Incredibly HIGH, this stuff is AWESOME! It's a hop lover's ideal beer and well worth the long agony of searching for. 1,198 charactersjzeilinger, Nov 06, 2010
3.65/5  rDev -16.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5Presentation: 22 oz. bomber bottle split with a friend. Served slightly chilled and brought up to room temperature. Big thanks to Twig86 for this,
Appearance: Cloudy bright orange in color with a two finger pillowy white head. Good retention. Also, as this settles, a decent amount of greenish blue yeast forms at that bottom.
Aroma: Really pungent pine notes assert themselves upfront. Some light grapefruit and floral notes too, but the pine notes from the hops dominate. 
Taste: The pine notes from the hops really dominate and they are absurbly bitter. The initial buest is truly all pine. There is a slight caramel and buttery undertone here. The pine notes are just too much here for me.
Mouthfeel: Medium to full bodied. A bit sticky with a slightly dry finish.
Drinkability: The ABV is well hidden, but the really piney hops make me think I couldn't have much more than a bomber.
Overall, a big and interesting IPA, but I felt slightly dissappointed. The pine notes in the hops were completely overpowering and bitter. I usually enjoy really dominate hops, but this profile was a bit different. Also, the buttery aftertaste was slightly offputting. Not something I would seek out again. 1,200 charactersGosox8787, Nov 06, 2010

A - Poured in my new Harpoon Leviathan glass. Mountain of dense, creamy, slightly off-white head that really sticks to the glass. Rusty gold in color and very clear. Nothing wrong whatsoever with the appearance.
S - Nothings but loads of fresh, raw hops in the aroma, ranging in character from grass clippings and pine to lemon zest and grapefruit.
T - As expected, tons of fruity hop taste up front followed by a pucker-inducing hop bitterness. Moderately acidic, as well. One of the most intricate hop characters in any beer! I only wish there was a bit more malt kick to back up all these hops.
M/D - Sticky-icky mouth and an aftertaste that lingers. I miss this beer so much after moving away from Indy. Thanks again, chrizzle, for the great beer and glass! Everyone must try this beer at least once. 866 charactersSirSketch, Nov 06, 2010

Bottle into 7oz glass, split 3 ways. From notes.
Appearance: Dark, hazy orange. A bit murky, nice head with good retention. It is a very appealing color.
Aroma is full of orange and bitters. 
Solid mouthfull of hops. Hop bitterness is forward and present through the finish. There is a lot of flavor to work around, well balanced in that it's not too piney/fruity/floral. Other folks found more fruit notes, or the bitterness more forward (from the same bottle) so this is certainly a complex brew that nicely allows for a wide range of palate's to enjoy it differently.
Fairly bitter, solid carbonation, alcohol is upfront but not dominant.
Damn drinkable. I split this with my cousin and brother and both agreed each could have had their own bottle without much effort.

Poured from bomber into pint glass. Dark orange with one finger dense head that left amazing lacing and had perfect retention. This one bursts with a huge citrus hop aroma with a sweet malty backbone. This beer has one of the best aroma's I've experienced to date...
Taste- Nothing but well balanced citrus BANG in this beer. Mango, grapefruit, and a piney, hoppy bit at the end that wasn't too much, but perfect. I want this beer to last forever...
Carbonation is right on with this one...good feel for sure. If i had to choose one beer to drink for the rest of my life this one might take the medal. There is so much going on this beer it's absolutely fun to drink. Well done FFF. 734 charactersMacky20, Nov 05, 2010

A - Golden orange with a 1-finger, off white head.
S - Very fragrent from a yard away. Sweet, like an orange creamsicle dipped in mango. Some hop floral and pine cuts through.
T - Very good. Plenty of citrus and floral hops. The tropical flavors aren't overcome by the caramel malt. There is plenty of bitterness, especially on the aftertaste. I'm glad it isn't as sweet as I would have expected from the smell. I taste the alcohol but it is subtle and compliments the brew. Well done.
M - Thick and moderately resinous. Medium carbonation. It does coat the mouth and leaves a lingering sweetness and bitterness, which I much appreciate. Not as prickly as a Sierra Nevada Ghidorah but leaning that way; again a characteristic I very much value. In the same league as Pliny the Elder, SN Ghidorah and SN Northern Hemisphere Harvest and Sculpin. That's saying a lot for me.
D - It's delicious. My style of DIPA. Wish I could get it in PA. 1,000 charactersTucquan, Nov 02, 2010
4.22/5  rDev -3.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5A big thanks to TCgoalie for supplying this delicious beer!
Appearance: Poured from a 22oz bomber into a large wine glass. Color is a beautiful burnt yellow with a big-bubbled, white one-finger head. Good retention and lacing. There is some fairly evenly displaced carbonation visible in the glass.
Smell: Pretty spectacular aroma coming from this beer. Lots of sweet pineapple and some grainy malt. I am definitely picking up the peach and mango the label speaks of, as the hop aroma is more tropical and sweet than bitter.
Taste: The hops do not disappoint in the flavor as well. I was thinking that with the warmth of the smell, this one might be a touch on the malty side, but that was definitely not the case. The hop bitterness smacks your tongue around right from the word go and sticks with you from start to finish. Complexity and depth of flavor increase as the beer warms and result in a well-balanced, delicious DIPA.
Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied, fairly bitter, with a well-hidden ABV.
Drinkability: Very drinkable for a double. I'm not sure I could distinguish this from a lesser alcoholic beer if blindfolded while drinking. I could definitely down a couple of these, although I would then find myself on the floor wondering what had happened. 1,259 charactersBuckyFresh, Oct 31, 2010
4.62/5  rDev +5.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5This is an old rating from a case of very fresh bottles.
Many, many fresh bottles consumed of this highest of worthies. Nose is breathtaking, brings you into a lush forest of pines, persimmons, and peahens. Explosions of grapefruit rind mingle with bright, vibrant pinecones and soft, light fruits to weave a delicious tapestry of a mysterious dream. Fresh indian spices seem to soar somewhere near the top, electric and exciting. Further underneath is a soft caramel and a quiet weeping. Vibrant, exciting, transcendent, and worthy of the highest respects and most solemn honors.
As I'm just entering some old reviews here I can't help but notice that this one read more like a poem than an actual review. I didn't really impress the level of prickly, bitter citrus here, which was mind-bending. The ultra fresh bottles of this from around 2007 were better than Pliny the Younger and were the best examples of this style I've had. 933 charactersJAXSON, Oct 31, 2010
2.95/5  rDev -32.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 2.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 2From the bottle into my Duvel tulip. Got this in a nice BIF box from Sopernicus.
A - Hazy orange body with a white head on top
S - Big citrus hop flavor with what smells like a decent malt backbone to stand up to it. 
T - Pretty balanced. A mix of citrus hops with a big malt backbone. Kind of boozy. Way more malt notes than I expected from this. Not nearly as hoppy as I expected
M - medium bodied, pretty good amoun of carbonation
D - Pretty drinkable. A decent beer but not an great one. sadly there are no dates present on the bottle so I have no way of knowing how fresh this is. I dunno the more I drink this the more let down I feel. Way too malty and boozy for a DIPA. I hope to try this on tap one day so I know what it tastes like fresh. 753 charactersjpmclaug, Oct 30, 2010
4/5  rDev -8.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Had this out of the bottle at PPBS a few nights ago, thanks Sean. Been wanting to try this one for a while, glad to finally have the chance. Poured into a tulip and served just south of cellar temp. 
Appearance: Red-orange hued brew with a small but billowy white head, that dissipates pretty rapidly. Good carbonation and nice lacing as it fades to empty. 
Smell: Grapefruity-citrus with pine, crystal malt sweetness, and a little booze. The hops open up more and more as the beer warms, but this is not your San Diego IPA, complete with huge amounts of dry-hopping. The beer smells like a good IPA, but there lacks this "WHAM" effect that Sculpin, most Alpine IPAs, Just Outstanding, Pliny, etc have. 
Taste: Citrusy-sweet, with much more boozy-biscuit than I am used to in IPAs. Hops are not as front-and-center as I'd expect from a brew this style, but they are still playing an active role with the ruby-red grapefruit and pine esters. I wish the crystal malt weren't so present, though. I don't see how much it really adds to much beyond take away somewhat from the glory of the hop.
Mouthfeel: Resinous and bitter, finishing warm from the ABV. This is one of the few DIPAs that actually drinks above its ABV, and there is no mistaking this brew pushes 10%. Bitterness is active as it goes along, really marking its IPA territory. 
Drinkability: Again, good, not great. Booze and alcohol, along with the sweetness, limit this from being too drinkable, but the hoppy, resinous IPA still buys back its enjoyability. In all, recommended if you can easily get it, but I would have a hard time trading too many San Diego IPAs for this one. If it were regularly available out here, I don't know how often I'd pick it up with the plethora of options in the DIPA department. 1,777 charactersnomomentwasted, Oct 30, 2010

A.
pours a nice hazy golden color. a nice amount of bubbly head. 
S.
powerful aroma of citrusy (grapefruit, mango, pineapple) hops and some nice caramelly malt smells. Maybe some subtle piney and flowerly hops in there as well.
T.
Just as aroma. A very hoppy and bitter taste in there. The sweet malts mellow it out a bit but still finishes a little bitter. Great tasting for a double IPA.
M.
medium bodied and perfect carbonation. bitterness and flavor really stays on your tongue for awhile. 
D.
A great tasting DIPA, but 1 is about all I can handle at a time. Especially this being the first beer of the day for me. If you're into bitter beers, this is an awesome one. 701 characterscetherid, Oct 24, 2010
4.85/5  rDev +10.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Reviewed from notes on 10/7/10. Thank you, TCGoalie, for picking up this gem for me. 
A: Pours a strikingly attractive golden-garnet and quite clear into a snifter, allowing an unimpeded view of swiftly moving carbonation bubbles. A little head disappears to leave an almost full cover of light khaki film. The lacing is top notch - very splashy, sticky, and fine. 
S: Wow, this is a fresh tropical fruit bonanza. Loads of mango, pineapple, and melon smells pair with fresh peach and orange aromas. A slick hop oil smell is present, along with a sweet caramel malt smell. This bouquet just shouts, "FRESH HOPS!" This is a large highly enticing smell. 
T: At the get-go, the caramel malt base asserts its delicious flavor, then the taste seamlessly transitions to heavenly tropical fruit and citrus hop yumminess. This sweet, fruity hop presence then rolls into a biting, bitter, high alpha-acid hop finish that lingers on the sides of my palate seemingly forever. The component ingredients of this beer meld together so well and result in just a scrumptious Imperial IPA. 
M: So slick and smooth of a feel graces my mouth at first. It is oily in an oh so good way. This smoothness then perfectly flows into a crisp, drying bite of a hop finish, that lingers for soooo long. Dreadnaught is a hearty medium bodied brew with just about perfect carbonation. 
D: I cannot say enough about how much I enjoyed this beer. I find it to be so drinkable for the style, with a perfect balance between caramel malt sweetness and delicious hop flavor. Combine that with an absolutely gorgeous color and how easily the beer goes down and you have an amazing creation. I will be stocking up on fresh Dreadnaught the next time I roll through Indiana. Cheers, Three Floyds! 1,760 charactersTCHopCraver, Oct 23, 2010
4.32/5  rDev -1.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Received as a mistake in a BIF, thanks again Kevin!
Poured into a SA Perfect Pint with a golden honey color that is only slightly hazy but is still mostly clear. Has a 2 finger fluffy white head that has good retention and great lacing. Smells mostly of grapefruit, mango, and pineapple with a good floral presence too and a little grain and sweetness from the malt. To describe the taste in one word, it would be juicy. All of the citrus and tropical fruits one can think of experiencing from hops are in here. The citrus fades to a bitter pine resin flavor that lingers and combines with the sweet and slightly wheaty malt presence that balances the taste out nicely. Feels a bit thin in body, but it is still coating and sticky, oddly enough. Moderate carbonation. Drinks so much better than any other DIPA I've ever had. This is not what I was expecting, and that is a great thing. I think I might be coming around to hop-bombs, and its beers like this that are making a strong case to buy IPAs and DIPAs more often. Still, I'm not sure if I think that a bomber of this is too much in one sitting, but I'm more sure that 12 oz. wouldn't be enough. 1,152 characterskbanks13, Oct 23, 2010

A- Caramel amber beer, nice dark coloration, super huge head with sticky lacing. Wow. 
S- Nice malt and aggressive citrus hops. 
T- Bitter f'in hops! Quite an assault. Nice malt backbone but the hops are in charge. Pine resin, very faint agave and grapefruit rind round it out. 
M- Great lingering bitterness, this beer shines in the finish. ABV is perfect.. well, maybe just shy of perfect, a bit hot on occasion. 
D- One and done, but I'd buy this on the regular if I could. A fantastic DIPA. I'm impressed. 562 charactersShogoKawada, Oct 20, 2010
5/5  rDev +13.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A - Bright gold with thick head as white as clouds. The head clings to the glass as if trying to escape from the hops. High carbonation that shows you how active this beer is in smell and taste. An amazing display! To add, the head laces the glass so well, you can see where each previous drink was.
S - Citrus and HOPS with caramel notes. The floral hops are giving off an exceptional, powerful aroma.
T - Citrus and caramel at first, but then the hops overwhelm you (in a great way). The hop taste will linger in your mouth for quite a while.
M - High carbonation to balance out the powerful hops.
D - There is no denying I love this beer. The drinkability is amazing. Depending on how people feel about powerful hop taste is the difference in drinkability. For me this is perfect! 787 charactersPTMcB, Oct 17, 2010

A - Hazy golden amber in color, it shines decently with a low-forming bone-colored head. Good retention with lots of spotty lace left over.
S - Hoptacular! Tons of freshly picked-smelling cascade and chinook hops just waft out of the brew freely. Notes of grapefruit citrus fall behind the pine needle. Rich caramel malts fill the aroma behind the hops providing a nice backbone.
T - It's not massively bitter which is what I was expecting from the nose. Lots of balanced hop flavor. Grapefruit resin and pine needle with hints of mango and lots of sweet caramel notes in the background.
M - Medium-bodied and sweet with a moderately bitter finish. Resiny and dry lingering. A good carbonation level adds a bit of a crisp finish.
D - Better shared but it's a good DIPA. I like this one a lot, not too bitter, good balance, nice flavor. Very well-done double. No hint of the alcohol that's in it at all. 974 charactersBeerFMAndy, Oct 17, 2010

A: pour into a Sam Adams perfect pint glass yeilds a lovely hazed gold-tan beer with a 1" beige head. Receding creates lacing that just wont quit.
S: Some serious dank hops at work here. Layers upon layers of citrus rind and sticky pine. Tone of baking bread underneath and a slight alcoholic nip on the back end. Nice. I'm getting giddy. 
T: Yesss...This is the good stuff. Super complex and balanced, much more balanced than I expected. Superb hop overtones with massive pine and grapefruit, and tight controlled bitterness. Not palate crushing by any means and well maintained by a bready and semisweet malt backing. Alcohol comes into the picture without ever being solvent or fusel. Only complaint from me is that I would like a little bit more bitterness. I wish I had a date on the bottle so I could determine if the bitterness has faded from a bit of time or if this is what the brewer intended. 
M: Nice and creamy. Fantastic rich body that has power and presence but never becomes cloying. Medium carbonation agitates the flavors out of the beer but is not prickly or overbearing. 
D: Good for what the beer is; this guy isn't meant to be thrown down quickly or in large quantities. 22oz is more than enough. 
All in all, this beer is not quite what I expected. It is every bit as good as I thought it was going to be but in a different manner. Really well done, and I hope one day I get the opportunity to catch a fresh pint at the source. 1,593 charactersahurd11085, Oct 15, 2010

S- Strong hops and a little piney. Citrus notes tickle the back of your nostril too.
T- Oh, my! Strong citrus, strong grapefruit, strong hops. Very wonderfully done...almost, sexy.

S: I can't decide if it's pineapple or grapefruit I'm picking up in the aroma, but it's definitely blended with piney hops. A very sweet smelling beer with fruity esters, loads of hops, a soft caramel malts in the background.
T: One of the sweeter DIPAs I've had, but is perfectly balanced with a much needed bitter aftertaste. Smooth grapefruit, light hops, sweet pineapple, mango, white sugars, and a noticable caramel malts are a great blend on the palate. Not as hoppy as some DIPAs, but still one of the better ones I've tried.
M: Medium body with lively carbonation and light syrup texture.
D: My first FFF and it was not a let down. Great beer that is extremely easy to drink. Highly recommend to any DIPA lover. 840 charactersBrewCrew2010, Oct 12, 2010

S - Big citrusy huge piny hop aroma, little bit of sweet malts. Lite fruity esters. A little alcohol.
F/M - Piny resinous citrusy hops. Quite resinous. Light caramel maltiness, little bit bready. Very bitter. Dry, slightly astringent finish. Lingering piny aftertaste. Medium body, moderate carbonation, light alcoholic warmth.
D - Good, clean and easy drinking. Too much resinous flavors, but that's okay. Quite flavorful and worthy of another glass. 650 charactersdomtronzero, Oct 09, 2010
4.27/5  rDev -2.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5This was a late addition to the tasting lineup as a friend had unexpectedly brought this back from Chicago for Trey. Trey was nice enough to share this with me.
Poured into a tulip, the color is deep orange amber. Capped off by a great thick and coarse head that leaves spotty gobs of lacing, this is a beautiful pour.
An explosion of citrus reminiscent of west coast IPAs. Grapefruit, pineapple, orange zest, and a huge dank hop bitterness inundate the nose. The taste is again intense grapefruit, hints of pineapple, but a great floral character slides in there as well. There is a good malt backbone that just serves to balance a bit of the bitterness but doesn't add noticeable sweetness. The alcohol is not easily found, as I had this pegged for a 7%er. 
Resinous and sticky, hops are the story of this beer. This is one that a) I wish were distributed in Philly, and b) I wish didn't fly off the shelves so quickly in the midwest so that I could get my hands on it more easily. 986 charactersNittanyBeerFan, Oct 09, 2010

A - Looks off liquid gold with some slight orange hints. There is a thin white head that recedes quickly and leaves a nice ring around the glass.
S - Delicious slight honey aromas with some nice sweet grapefruit and tangerines. Very typical but well executed DIPA aroma. Nice flowery bouquet as well. There is a lot of tropical fruits in here as well. Pineapple and some papaya. Wow. The more I get into this aroma the more variety pops up. 
T & M - Flavor is as expected and delicious. Starts off with some nice citrusy hop flavor and some nice bitterness. It is followed by that great tropical fruit flavor. Tangerines and grapefruit with sweet oranges as well. After this nice hop pageant there is a solid malt backbone with nice grassy and earthy tones. Some nut and slight spices are also perceived. The feel is nice and medium bodied with great alcohol warmth and nice crisp notes. Great carbonation level. Clean flavors as well.
D - Very delicious and highly deserved of praise. Very easy to drink because its well made. Higher ABV might be a danger. 1,102 charactersJoEBoBpr, Oct 03, 2010
4.57/5  rDev +4.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Pours a hazy golden yellow with slight hues of red and green. I'm guessing the green hue comes from the wealth of dry hopping. 
The smell is a good combination of malts and tropical hops. Pineapple, orange, and pine hop oils are pleasantly placed to provide a great aroma.
The taste is chock full of hops with a good deal of malts to balance it. This has the balance of 60% hops 40% malts as I like in a DIPA. After the initial taste of caramel malts, my mouth is bombarded by pleasant tropical hops that remind me of pineapple and mangos. There is also peach, orange, and a bit of pine in the aftertaste. 
This has a rich feel in the mouth that is medium to full in body but definitely heavy on the tongue. The taste is clean for how hoppy it is providing a mild hop aftertaste.
This is a very drinkable DIPA, especially at nearly 10%.
I really enjoy FFF's beers, the hop combinations are great. They definitely have the hoppy beers down, I wish I could get my hands on some dark lord to try their high end stouts. 1,020 charactersTCgoalie, Oct 02, 2010
4.88/5  rDev +11.2%look: 3 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Served in a stone IPA glass with Real Time playing. The perfect glass and politics to enhance it all...what better setting for my 100th BA review!
Pours a golden copper orange color, a touch lighter than many similar IIPAs. Two/three finger head. Not the thickest or creamiest, but very respectable none the less. 
A floral symphony! Grape fruit, citrus lemon and other flavors. The malt is so subtle in the back ground it is almost like it's not there. 
Damn...this bottle is old! Well so much for the perfect 100th review, but since FFF doesn't bottle date I suppose this is how they wanted me to enjoy it. OK...it's not really old but compared to the tap version I had last week this is a huge step back. Hops up front pinching on the tongue, citrus and amazingly clean and crisp. A bit fresher and they almost bite down on your tongue and burn like alcohol will at the finish of a beer. Here the malt is getting a bit more attention than it serves. Caramelized fruit mixes in with the citrus notes and truly doesn't disappoint. Amazing how this beer effects the tongue. All beers should hit the front of your tongue first where you will pick up on the sweet malt and then as the beer moves back you'll pick up on the bitter effects. The malt opens this beer barely, but the hops just out of nowhere just consume your entire tongue. Then as they leave the malt sticks around just long enough to remind you that it's also a sweet beer. The alcohol is virtually non existent. 
 I often feel the best sign of a GREAT IPA is that when a hair more age than you'd like, it's still an amazing treat. Hopslam does this...and I feared dreadnaught was a one trick pony, but nope. This is still a true master piece.
I often pass by this beer because of the price. 10 bucks for a 22oz is obscene. That's nearly a 33 dollar 6 pack. Or nearly double the price of a hopslam 6er. But damn if this isn't worth it. This beer is just sublime. 1,931 charactersbobhits, Oct 02, 2010

Smell is tropical fruits and orangey hops. Nice pineapple, mango smell mingled with orange zest and slightly piney hops.
Taste lives up to the awesome smell. There is a nice malt bill that compliments the tropical fruit flavors and smooth hoppy character. Not an over-the-top hop bomb but rather a nice balanced fruit juicy hop presence. Tons of hops in the mix but not bitter. Finish dries the palate out nicely.
Wonderfully creamy ever so slightly resiny mouthfeel. Superb.
Well, what's not to like? Not for fans of west coast style hop bombs for sure but this is one really well balanced brew. Being that it costs as much as a sixer of Alpha King I want to hate it but I can't. It's just too damn good.
Well done Three Floyds! 790 charactersbrewdan, Sep 30, 2010

The big head didn't really stick around long and there wasn't a tremendous of lacing. The smell is of pine and tropical fruits. There's also a good amount of sweet bready malts noticeable in the aroma. Great hop presence on the tongue. Again, a biting pine with tropical fruits following. The finish is of bitter grapefruit. Pretty good amount of sweetness to balance, but there just wasn't as much bitterness as I was hoping for. I actually thought this was a bit on the weak side for a DIPA. Perhaps I thought this was going to be something it was never intended to be. In any regard it is very good. I've just had other DIPA's that offer a bit more in viscosity and bitterness. 809 charactersalkemy, Sep 26, 2010

A: Medium golden copper with a thick 1+ inch white head that fades at a decent pace. Very good.
S: I get intense citrus / piney hops upfront quickly followed by some grapefruit and finished with some faint suagry malt. Good.
T: Starts with an incredibly bitter dry hop which is quickly followed by some grapefruit. Some creamy citrus in the middle with faint malty fruit hidden on the back. Good.
M: Medium body with a heavy dry carbonation. Decent.
D: This one is a little tougher to get through because of the super bitter hop forcefield. Once you break the barrier, you're good. Decent.
All in all, this is a good brew. Glad I got to try it. If you like super bitter / dry IPA's, then this is your brew. I'm not huge on the super bitter thing, so it's good for me, but not great. Definitely worth hunting if you like the style. 926 characterssteve8robin, Sep 26, 2010

A: Cloudy, light orange/yellow color with about 1/2 finger worth of head and nice carbonation.
S: OK, this thing is starting to scare me. My mouth is puckered, I've got my guard up, and I'm bracing myself for the hop explosion! Malt, orange, grapefruit, a bit of peach, and awesomeness! - in that order.
T: Man candy! Lady candy! Everybody candy! This one is actually very malty and the alcohol taste like it is wrapped in pixie stick dust, gummy bears, cotton candy, and every other yummy junk food under the sun. It's almost caramel and pine were mixed together, re-mix, and continuously tweaked until perfection was achieved. Wowser!
M: Despite its name, this one doesn't coat, but it's definitely a slow drinker. VERY slow even. Is citrus a texture? That is really the best way to describe the mouthfeel on this one.
D: This is one of those rare brews that gets even better after every sip. If a genie granted me three wishes, I would use one of them to ask the genie to give me the talent that the peeps at FFF possess. The ABV is high, the candy-coated alcohol is present, but I don't give a shit.

No - to not much lacing to speak of. Aroma is a little lacking. A little lemon and pine hop aroma meets the nose. Flavor makes up for what the aroma lacks. Good maltyness with a little crystal malt to pop it. Good lemony and pine hop up front and through the middle with a nice lingering bitter finish that lasts. Mouthfeel is a little slick, but still good. I was honestly expecting a lot more from this beer. I had high hopes. I'd give it another try, maybe my bottle was a little old. 581 characterspmlondrigan, Sep 26, 2010

Wow this is a nicely done beer. I had no idea it was 9.5% Hops and malt working together make this a well rounded and fantastic IPA. 374 charactersStrix, Sep 24, 2010
4.97/5  rDev +13.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured from a 22oz. bottle (no freshness date) into a Duvel tulip glass.
Appearance: Pours a hazy orange with a tight, sticky head. A small amount of carbonation bubbles maintain a lasting head.
Smell: Very fruity aroma. I get bursts of mangos, oranges, grapefruits, and other citrus fruits. Some light herbal notes followed by a firm malty backbone of caramel/toffee. I could smell this all night.
Taste/Mouthfeel: Wow! What a wonderful blend of citrus hops and sweet caramel malts. Intense tropical fruits interwoven with superb aromatic malts. Mouthfeel is so smooth, rich, and creamy. Bitterness is there, but this is so well balanced that it seems minimal.
Drinkablility: For an Imperial IPA at 9.5% abv, this one drinks very well. No alcohol presence at all. This is so good, a fruit fly I just found in my glass couldn't even resist. He kept buzzing around trying to get a whiff of this great brew and was fearless enough to make the ultimate sacrifice for one little sip of Dreadnaught. Dreadnaught, a word that literally means fear nothing. 1,053 charactersballz50401, Sep 22, 2010

A golden orange with lots of suspended particles and a couple little flakes being moved around by tiny little bubbles feeding a two finger head that slowly falls to a film leaving a fair bit of lace along the way
S lots of tropical fruit like the bottle says peach and mango are there but I get lots of pineapple, guava a little grapefruit and a tiny bit of pine and caramel with floral aspect that brings it all together. I love a big ass fruity DIPA and this one delivers and the booze is nowhere to be found
T a little more caramel and pine but other then that it tastes as it smells and I wouldn't ask for much more
M not overly thick and a little coarse but it's bitter without doubt and enjoyable
D my bomber went down a little faster then I planned, this one could hurt you if you let it. I would like some more but I wouldn't want to drink another bomber
one of the better DIPA's I've ever had and I would love to be able to buy it in my part of the world but for now I'll need to thank MasterSki for sending it my way 1,069 characterswordemupg, Sep 19, 2010

S: The aroma on this IPA is simply incredible. Savory fruit, grapefruit, a little citrus zest, some floral notes. There is a lot going on here.
T: The flavor profile, like the nose, runs the pallet trough the ringer. Hops add piny bitterness with fruit and floral notes. Sweet bitterness is the best description. A little alcohol burn is present on the back of the pallet halfway trough this bomber.
MF: The mouthfeel is full, and carbonation is almost perfect. This aids in the flavor really lingering on your pallet mmhmm.
D: Drinkability is excellent as well, I can barely imagine better.
Overall, I've had a rough day at work, and would like to thank Augustiner719 for the trade. I would definitely seek this brew out again, and wish I had another few behind it in the fridge. 951 charactersTKEbeerman, Sep 16, 2010
4/5  rDev -8.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Slightly hazed golden blond body. Generally I look for more of an orangish tint in a DIPA but the color could indicate good things to come (hopefully the crystal malt is not over done). Three finger off white head made up of loosely packed bubbles. Splotchy lacing left as the head recedes at a moderate clip, some rocky foam left floating atop for just a bit longer. 
Hops dominate the nose. Grapefruit aroma is is plentiful, the strongest of the citrus aroma. Pineapple, orange followed by mango and subtle tropical fruit aromas are noticed as you work your way down. The malt lends a light breadiness found well underneath the hop aroma, certainly not the "pronounced caramel malt" base, maybe this will appear in the flavor. 
The flavor begins much the way you would expect it following a sniffy sniff. The hops are strong, delivering a large dose of fresh citrus fruit, pith and light pinyness. As the beer warms the malt is allowed to break through the thick blanket of hops. The crystal malts are not over done but are certainly noticeable. I am picking up more of the residual sweetness with warmth, this is less to my likings. This beer definitely has a sweet spot regarding temperature. Too cold you lose a lot of the hops and general flavor for that matter, too warm there is a smidge too much sweetness.
Medium bodied beer with the carbonation being a bit livelier than I expected. The texture is smooth with a lot of flavor digging deep making for a long finish.
I think the best thing about this beer is the drinkability. No single attribute really stood out to me while enjoying this one. Once you take a look back at the beer as a whole, consider IBU's and ABV you can realize some of the beauty of this beer. The bitterness is not overwhelming, the alcohol is not hot, flavors are not offensive. This beer is better than my score but I simply cannot score it higher. Definitely one I would drink again and would recommend. 1,943 characterskzoobrew, Sep 15, 2010

Reviewed totally blind. 
A- Right off the bat I wanna say this is an IIPA. Its a gorgeous bright amber with very little head, even with a semi rough pour. Little pearls of foam cling to the glass.
S- This is GREAT smelling and very unique. Lots of pine and luscious tropical fruits, but where it gets special is the fact that there is a very strong milky element. Big milk sugary creaminess smooths out, but doesnt hide all the piney hops. Really it makes it smell like an orange cream sickle. Incredible.
T- Dude, WOW. Im having trouble not sucking this down. I have to concentrate, leave enough to review... Lots more milkiness that makes this like an orange cream sickle. Bittering pine finishes things out. Some alcohol is picked up. I would peg this at around the 10% mark.
M- Creamy, yet crisp and clean. Finishes dry with a hoppy, piney resinous aftertaste.
D- What can I say? The juxtiposition between crisp, biting hops, citrus, pine and smooth, creamy, sweet milkiness is simply stunning. 
Thanks again AleWatcher! 1,164 charactersMbpBugeye, Sep 14, 2010

T - Definite citrus notes with a great hop bite. after taste is slightly alcoholic tasting that lingers.

Pours with a small, off-white head and a hazy golden hued body. Good lacing. Aroma is quite nice with hops, pine, and orange, maple syrup and brown sugar. Taste is a ton of hops with some exotic fruits and caramel. Light carbonation and syrupy mouthfeel. Alcohol is well hidden. 382 charactersBMan1113VR, Sep 10, 2010

A - Pours a hazy tangerine with a frothy 1" white cap. Leaves stringy lacing as the beer falls. 
S - Apricot, pine and citrus on the nose. Lots of awesome aromas complementing each other here. 
T - Mimics the aroma with tropical citrus fruits. Some alcohol is present, but it doesn't taste like 9.5%. 
M - Good carbonation. The malts really carry the hops through this beer. A heavy tasting IIPA in a very good way. 
D - This is a fantastic double IPA. You know its big, but its not overpowering. I could definitely enjoy a few of these on a hot day. 659 charactersstawn, Sep 09, 2010

A - Deep orange, amber with a one finger of off-white head that laced the glass the whole way down.
S - Very nice smell. Sweet malts and tons of piney hops as well as some floral. Didn't get much of the citrus flavors the bottle foretold of though.
T - Super hoppy. I found the hop taste to be very resinous and sharply bitter. It was enjoyable but seemed a bit one dimensional. I actually found myself more drawn to the sweet caramel malt characteristics. Maybe my bottle didn't travel well, but I would have liked some more hop flavor and less straight bitterness.
M - Full bodied, creamy with just enough carbonation. Really hit the nail on the head here.
D - The alcohol content comes through a bit strong, but hey, it is 9.5% ABV. The smoothness of the mouthfeel and the sweetness from the malts helped the drinkability despite the alcohol content. Enjoyable, but I probably won't seek it out again unless it's super fresh. 1,051 characterscharliedvrs, Sep 02, 2010

A-light gold, not as dark as I'd like to see for a double IPA, very thin head
S-holy hops! somewhat citrusy but just perfect smelling for a double IPA, adds so much excitement for the first sip
T-great initial hoppy taste, quickly fades in to a strong bitter aftertaste that lasts
M-medium carbonation, feels good
D-ABV hits quickly, hoppiness fades and bitterness increases as the glass becomes more empty...but then you remember you have almost half the bottle left and interestingly enough I pour the 2nd half and the opposite seems to happen, and the drink becomes wonderful all over again with the original taste. The 22 ounce bottle is enjoyed the entire way through. I wouldn't be able to enjoy more than one however. 756 charactersAdamBear, Sep 02, 2010

 pours a deep almost burnt golden orange with a minimal short lived head, fair amount of lacing.
 not a real pronounced smell on this one, kind of a ying-yang of sweetness and hops happening.
 taste is interesting with the hops bitterness and the sweet maltiness battling the whole way down for control, in the end it's the alcohol that wins, with a nice splash of warmth at the very end.
 decent mouth with a slight lingering effect that turns to a warm glow,nice!Moderate heaviness,low carbonation.

4.89/5  rDev +11.4%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 522oz bomber
Pours a lovely gold color with a fairly thin head that dissipates quickly. Just opening the bomber and pouring a glass fills the room with citrus fruit aromas-- this is a very pungent beer. The first sip is likewise a hop explosion of the highest order, with waves of citrus fruit washing over my tongue. The bottle alleges that there is a "strong caramel malt backbone," but it is rather difficult to detect and completely obliterated by the bitter hop goodness. Decent amount of carbonation gives it a smooth, crisp taste that stains my tongue with hop bitterness. Alcohol is well hidden. 
Simply an amazing beer. 629 charactersBaraka, Aug 26, 2010
4.35/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Pours a nice amber orange color into a perfect pint. Ever so slightly off white one finger head recedes into a layer of thin bubbles. 
Smell is topical fruits topped with caramel sauce, the kind you get on ice cream, and pine needles.
Up front you get a salvo of tropical fruits and citrus zest, and at the back a wheaty malt type flavor with a hint of....corn? 
Mouthfeel is smooth but a bit watery and has some nice prickly carbonation at the back.
Drinkability is good for a 9.5% beer. Alcohol is present but not overwhelming. Almost like a caution sign.

4.47/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5On-tap at FFF
A - It pours a peachy-golden hue with a fair amount of turbidity. A persistent creamy swath of ivory colored foam crowns the brew and leaves copious residual lacing. It looks like a dangerously big DIPA, which is exactly what it turns out to be.
S - Damn this brew is big! It seems that you can actually smell the viscosity. The hugely hoppy nose features tons of grapefruit aroma, rind and juice, as well as impressions of the sap that leaks from fresh-picked mango. 
T - Deliciously potent; this beer is literally like a huge IPA, doubled. An intensely bitter grapefruit-citric and resiny hop presence is so relentless in its boldness that it would be far too much if it weren't for the virtual malt porridge and generous alcohol punch that supports it. Even as I drain the glass, it remains as challengingly bitter and bold, albeit with more complexity; notes of orange blossom, pine tar and confederate jasmine develop and the sweetness of the malt begins to be juxtaposed with the alcohol zest. 
M - DIPA. Great. This beer is so big and viscous, and yet it pulls it off so exceptionally well.
D - Though it is not on the more drinkable side of the style, this beer is a virtual paradigm of DIPA. That said, I think I prefer Apocalypse Cow (a non-paradigm) amongst FFF DIPAs. 1,298 charactersktrillionaire, Aug 24, 2010

A - Pours a nice hazy orange, golden yellow color with about a .5 finger eggshell white head. 
S - Smell is AWESOME! Tons of citrus hops coming through. A tremendous aroma of grapefruit, mango and peach quite unlike any IPA I have smelled before. A sweet malty backbone is apparent and rounding a great aroma. Really outstanding.
T - Follows the nose almost exactly. The citrus hop presence is amazing. Fruity notes of mango, grapefruit and pineapple take the forefront with a slightly resinous hop presence as well. The malt backbone rounds out the flavor profile nicely.
M - Medium bodied with a nice hop stickiness to it. Carbonation was slightly on the heavy side.
D - Very quickly became one of my top 5 IPA's. Amazing taste, smell and overall feel. Could easily put several of these away on a hot summer day. 890 charactersKAP1356, Aug 24, 2010

A - Pours a hazy orange with a thin layer of tight, white head. Retention settles to a skim across the top with nice, sticky lacing
S - Big citric, tropical and pine hop nose. Nice balance between resin, grapefruit and pineapple - some sweeter, fruity esters in the background. 
T&M - Huge dose of hop oils, very bright hop flavors: grapefruit, resin, navel orange with a bit of tropical thrown in. Alcohol is palatable and provides a warmth. A caramelized malt backbone makes itself known mostly in a hop oil slicked finish that lingers. Medium-full body.
D - A good IPA from FFF, well worth seeking out and trying. Alcohol and huge hop notes more likely then not make this a one bottle a session kind of brew. 775 charactersZeroSignal, Aug 15, 2010
4.49/5  rDev +2.3%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4.5Bomber into a Duvel tulip.
A: A fairly rough, high pour is necessary to create an inch of fine white head atop the hazy red-orange body; good retention and some sticky lace help matters, but this one looks like it might be a bit undercarbonated. Still, the overall appearance is quite appealing.
S: Huge, robust hop presence, with the dominant aromas being on the fruity side (grapefruit, orange, mango, and peach), as well as some more herbal, resinous hop notes. The caramel malt backbone is apparent, but only adds a sweet, malty undercurrent to the already great hop complexity. Absolutely awesome, and just about as good as you can hope for from a sweet, fruity DIPA. Reminds me a lot of Hopslam, which is a good thing.
T: Much like the nose, with a ton of hops fighting tooth and nail with a ton of caramel malt. The malts are a bit more apparent up front, with a gigantic assault of citrus hops closing things out with major bitterness. Not quite as complex and well-rounded as the nose, but still astonishing in its power and intensity. Delicious.
M: Sticky medium body with a moderate amount of sharp carbonation. Could be better.
D: The bomber is absolutely disappearing on me, which is a shame. Highly drinkable DIPA.
Notes: This is a great beer, highly deserving of its accolades. I love the fruity hops, and the malts really add to the beer without overwhelming things at all. Huge, complex, and balanced, Dreadnaught is doubtless a top shelf Imperial IPA. I think I still prefer Apocalypse Cow, though.

A: Pours a nice, deep orange color, with a small head, that quickly fades. 
S: very fruity. I smell mangos and apricots, in addition to a load of hops. I don't smell much malt and I love that in a IIPA.
T: This is a very hop forward beer. Right off the bat and in the very first taste. The mango and apricot smells come through in the taste as well as a lot of other citrus. 
D: A super drinkable 9.5% IIPA. While drinking, I was thinking this was in the low 8% range. I love this beer!!!! It is exactly what a IIPA should be....high hops, and low malt. YUMMY!!!
I only wish that one day FFF will be more widely available. 738 characterscbak999, Aug 13, 2010

Appearance - Pours into a tulip with a hazy, vibrant tangerine color. Over two fingers of white fluffy head is achieved, that slowly dissipates, leaving great looking lacing.
Smell - Oh that smell...I have had this beer numerous times in the past but am finally reviewing it now. Each time I open one up, the aroma is entrancing. Pineapple, orange, grapefruit, sweet citrus mixed with hops, pine, and a caramel malty backbone.
Taste - Similar to the nose. A heavy citrus burst up front followed by a moderate though not overly bitter hop and pine flavor. There is a nice sweet malt backbone that makes this beer just taste great. Grapefruit, slight lemon, orange, etc. Very good.
Mouthfeel - Medium bodied, decent carbonation, creamy.
Drinkability - Extremely. I always pick this up when I am in the Midwest. A damn good beer. 881 charactersSpdKilz, Aug 10, 2010

A. 2 fingers of head. Thick lacing. Very good retention. Perfect color for an IPA. Nice hazy bright orange. 
S. Smell is all hops. Lots of citrus coming from this beer. Grapefruit, pineapple, orange. Tropical fruit paradise. A little bit of malt sweetness lies beneath. This is all about the heavenly citrusy hops. You can pick up a bit of alcohol smell as it warms. Smells like fruit juice as it warms. 
T. Taste is very good. Very smooth. Lots of bitterness from the hops. Again lots of tropical fruit comes out in the taste. Has a dry biscuit malt underneath all the hops that works very nice. Really no heat at all. Bitterness lingers for quite a while. 
M. Medium bodies. Mouth coating bitterness from the hops, that lingers for quite a while. Medium carbonation.
D. Very drinkable. This goes down like an IPA. Love the tropical fruit smell and taste. This is one of my favorite DIPA behind only Hopslam, and PTE. 960 characterssiradmiralnelson, Aug 07, 2010

Poured in to Duvel tulip
A - Medium orange colour with a yellow glow throughout and a finger of bubbly white head. 
S - Intense aroma of bitter hops up front with lots of juicy citrus and tropical fruit notes. Plenty of tangerine, mango, grapefruit and some pine as well. A nice sweet caramel backbone is evident in the background. 
T - Follows the nose with bitter hops up front that are full of citrus and tropical fruit notes. Mango and tangerine are the most apparent flavours but there is also some grapefruit, peach and pine. A subtle sweet caramel malt backbone is there in the background but this beer is mostly hops and the malts simply provide a nice sweet background taste to the bitter juicy hops that also linger nicely in the finish.

Foggy pale orange with a dishwater soapy fluff that sticks to the surface like some horror film where oil billows to the surface of a beautiful Gulf from some underwater well creating some horrendous environmental debacle where some British accented douche attempts to make everything right in the world again, only to fail and be replaced by a softer, gentler side of some mega corporation. Thankfully, it's only a movie.
Nose is needly pine, tropical Starburst, and a healthy additional of caramel sundae with alcohol topping: slightly faded?
Easily the most tropically hoppy DIPA I've ever imbibed. Mango, Gummy peaches (my God were those fantastic), and very similar to the dried sugared papaya slices that have been calling me from the cabinet lately. Sugary sweet tropical hops lend to this beer having a rather unique hop profile.
Moutfeel is sticky, syrupy sweet and if a drop of this were to hit the floor, I believe the local ant population would go ape shit. 
The drinkability is pretty good, but this beer is quite the gamble. The syrupy body can become a chore over time and for as many wonderful bottles as I've enjoyed, there have been an equal amount of dated duds. Why, oh why, does Three Floyds not date their bottles? 1,338 charactersBarrytheBear, Aug 04, 2010

Pours a clear yellow orange with a three finger slightly off-white head that subsides to one finger very slowly. Maintains lacing throughout. The aroma is comprised of tropical fruit, subtle malt, and nice hops. The flavor is of tropical fruit, malt, and a nice crisp hoppy followthrough with the tropical fruit mixing in with the hop flavor. It has a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this is a very interesting IIPA. All of the characteristics of this one is very nice. The hoppy followthrough isn't as smooth as usually enjoy but it is still not abrasive on the palate though. I can see why this brew gets such awesome reviews... 743 charactersthagr81us, Aug 04, 2010

Smooth and creamy up front with a big wave of hops coming next. Lots of smooth creamy citrus hops with a light bready malt backbone to follow it up. This DIPA is unique and delicious.
Mouthfeel is awesome, smooth creamy and delicious. Very smooth mouthfeel, velvety on the tongue, superb.
Very drinkable as well, maybe too drinkable. Exceptional DIPA seek this one out if you are a hop head. 694 characterspmccallum86, Jul 27, 2010
4.67/5  rDev +6.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Many thanks to BlueJacket74 for hooking up this bottle!!
A- Poured from the 22oz. bottle with a 1/2" off-white head, which slowly receded to a haze layer with nice bit of lacing left behind. The body was a semi-opaque orange-tinged amber color with no visible carbonation.
S- Hop-forward with bucketloads of earthy hops... and a notably rich aroma of crackerlike vienna malt as well. While hop-forward, this is not overwhelmingly hoppy. Just simple, rich and elegant.
T- Starts out quite balanced with tons of that crackerlike vienna malt and earthy hop flavor. Midway, a mild hop bitterness kicks-in which slowly builds into the dry finish, which leaves an earthy-resinous flavor lingering. A wonderful dynamic as this beer progresses from balanced to hop-forward with each delicious sip!
M- Full bodied with a creaminess imparted by a soft and delicate carbonation. Slight astringency, which is to be expected for the style.
D- Incredibly drinkable for the 9.5% ABV. The alcohol is so well hidden throughout the aroma/flavor/mouthfeel. I would drink this stuff until I couldn't drink no more! 
Thanks again Brian for hooking this up!!! 1,143 charactersjgasparine, Jul 26, 2010
4.5/5  rDev +2.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A - Slightly hazy orange-amber with a 1-finger head that quickly dissipates to chunky bubbles. Leaves large, soap-bubble lacing.
S - Tons of juicy tropical fruit ; pineapple, mango, mandarin orange. Sweet caramel malt and pine resin. Lovely nose!
T - Not as tropical as I thought it would be, lots of grapefruit and pine resin. I'm also detecting an unusual (but pleasant) floral element, almost like rose water or hibiscus, that adds an unexpected depth of flavor. Sweet caramel malt backbone really helps the balance and keeps this from being a pure hop-bomb.
M - Medium-bodied with nice fizzy carbonation that really lingers on the tongue.
D - Great beer, my 22oz is going quickly. Certainly hoppy, but very balanced and drinkable. Yet another amazing brew out of 3 Floyds, this one definitely lives up to the hype and stands as a shining example of an American DIPA. 874 charactersjsanford, Jul 25, 2010
4.32/5  rDev -1.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 422oz bottle shared, poured into standard wine glass.
A: Foamy one finger head, that retreats rather quick. Leaving a foamy, thick lacing. Body is a burnt orange color, appearance shows a thick and full bodied beer.
S: A bold aromatic hop profile of grape, orange, peach and grapefruit. A true beer to sit and smell.
T/M: A full bodied, crisp and warming mouthfeel. Thick caramel and malt on the finish. A solid base of citrus hops thought. A very good IIPA in regards to taste and mouthfeel. A bit lacking on the end of complete package, the many complexities did not blend well together to make a solid, well rounded taste, the flavors all jumped out at different points and did not have the total effect I have experienced with other IIPAs.
D: Well a bit to expensive for the overall experience. I would get more for out-of-town friends, but for my goto IIPA, ehh not so much. But the ability to drink it woo, thats were this brew is kickin' up the points. I could not put the glass down, the flavors all were very intense. Great Brew, wish it was a bit cheaper, to make it a part of my goto stock. 1,104 charactersGDBEERMAN, Jul 18, 2010
4.5/5  rDev +2.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.522 oz bomber poured into pint glass
A: Not totally clear orange, some parts get to light amber while some are verging on deep orange, super dense cap that takes forever to decrease, super creamy off-white, stays .5 finger the whole time
S: Super fragrant hops, big juicy tropical fruits and resin, super sticky smelling, mouth watering, the tropical fruits are so powerful
T: As good as I expected, super super flavorful, but never kills your palate with bitterness, the fruits are starting to build on your tongue and then a huge resin flavor starts to grab your tongue, actually manages to have decent sweet effect too, the fruits and the malt that help out a lot, I was expecting some malt but this is relatively balanced compared to what I was expecting, I like the malt component, just a little biscuity sweetness but not cloying or heavy
M: Really good, again showing the perfect balance, that malt really helps here, not thin like some DIPA's can be if they go for all hops, definitely above medium body
D: Very high, just so good
Notes: This beer definitely lived up to my expectations, which were very high. They did not surpass them, however, as you can see a 4.5 is pretty high. I consider SN Pale Ale to be a solid beer. I had one after drinking this and not only the the hops taste bland, but it tasted thin too. That just goes to show how powerful this beer is. 1,381 charactersdpodratsky3, Jul 18, 2010
4.47/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Big thank you to phisigben for hooking me up with this for my first trade. 
Pours a hazy golden color, reminds me of fresh apples cider, warm looking. Thin puff of white head that doesn't stay long and leaves no lacing.
Smell is killer! Steals the show for sure. The thing I pick up the most would be the tropical fruits, but the alcohol is ever present in the nose. Mango, pineapple, tangerine, some floral notes, noticeable malty character. 
The flavor is big to say the least. Hit up front immediately with tangerine, some peach and mango and pine, strong malt backbone to the flavor with some booze peeking through to remind you of the 9.5 ABV. 
Great mouthfeel. Perfect carbonation level for my taste, smooth as can be and for an imperial ipa the finish is not as bitter as many of its brethren. 
Drinkability is not the strongest due to the huge flavors and alcohol content here but it is delicious and unique. This stacks among some of the top DIPAs I have ever had a chance to try. So glad I finally got a chance to enjoy this, wish I had access to it all the time. 1,074 charactersPdiddey3d, Jul 16, 2010
4.57/5  rDev +4.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Brown bomber poured into a snifter. Thanks to Timmi for this one. No indentification of freshness via bottle date/code to be found on the label or glass.
Dreadnaught appears a hazed golden orange color. 2 fingers of white creamy foam appear slightly stained yellow and display some pretty decent powers of retension. Lace clings with legs around the glassware with each sip and a complete wall of lace in other spots.
The aroma is a very fruity and floral example of the style. Smells of spicey pine meet a fruitiness like mango in the nose. As it warms some more herbal notes come out along with a slight indication of the alcohol present in this brew. The smell of this brew is pretty much my favorite aspect of this experience.
Tasting dreadnaught reveals a much more mellow bitterness than I was expecting. The hops are quite flavorful tasting of pine and some herbal dryness that really lingers in the mouth. The malt is present with a bit of fruitiness that is slightly sweet to balance out the hop bitterness that comes through. In the finish is where the herbal flavors and a bit of dryness meets the alcohol bite to provide quite a spicey flavor. As it warms some of the malt takes on a taste of slightly dark caramel that was not immediately noticeable when slightly chilled.
At first this brew was really deceptive. For something pushing 10% alcohol it is really well hidden. As it warms the alcohol comes through and exaggerates more of what I refer to as "the herbal dryness" in this brew. This is a medium bodied brew with a moderate level of carbonation that at times feels a bit low. For 9.5% abv this is a really drinkable DIPA, well balanced on all accounts and something I would really enjoy again if the opportunity arose. 1,746 charactersstakem, Jul 11, 2010
4.72/5  rDev +7.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4The label on this beer gets it just about right. 
"A hophead's dream beer." Check. In spades.
"[A]n opening salvo of mango, peach and citrus hop aromas." Check. I found that the citrusy, grapefruit scent predominated, and the mango and peach flavors presented themselves on the tasting. (It may be of interest to some that I had this beer sampled by a connoisseur of things other than beer and his opinion was that the scent and taste were strongly redolent of cannabis.)
"[P]ronounced caramel malt backbone." Semi-check. It's there. It balances the beer. It mellows the aftertaste. But I'd say the backbone of this beer is its hops. 
Fans of American IPA's will not be disappointed. 683 charactersplinythethirsty, Jul 08, 2010

A: Pours a bright glowing gold with a finger of bright white head that faded into a thin film that left rings of tight lace around the glass.
S: Notes of pineapple, syrupy sweet sugar and malt, citrus, tangerine and floral notes including rose.
T: Very citrusy with medium bitterness and a fruity sweet malt backbone. Alcohol is mostly hidden. Lots of grapefruit, lemon and slight earth and pepper.
M: Medium body with soft carbonation and a perfect mouthfeel. Not syrupy or very stick at all. Alcohol lingers ever so slightly on your tongue after you swallow. 
D: Very smooth, delicious, and impressively balanced. It's also very sweet, but in a good way. 717 charactersscottfrie, Jul 07, 2010

Semi-dark golden color that is lighter around the edges. Hard pour makes a one finger white head. Decent lacing left behind, and solid retention.
Smells of sweet honey malts. Mango, peach and citrus hops.
The flavor is pretty much the same. Quite sweet. Honey, mango, peach and an orange rind citrus. Lots of hop oils.
Pretty full bodied. Well carbonated. A nice bite and lots of hop oils.

smell is citrus and a hint of pine. fruity not overly impressive. 
taste is an explosion of citrus. i get peach, pine, mango, and lemon flavors. very complex with just enough malt to balance it all out. they hit a homerun with this, lives up to the hype in taste.
mouthfeel is smooth maybe a tiny bit thin but well made.

A: This is beer is one of the most beautiful beers I have seen. It has a perfect gold color, a one finger white head with excellent retention and excellent lacing
S: Lots of hops! The dominate smells are pine, grapefruit, and lemon.
T: I would summarize this beer as a study in hops. The hops are big and pronounced but also wonderfully done. The taste is a lot like the nose with flavors of pine , The only minor criticism that I might levy against this beer is that it could have used a tad more balance or malt character.
M: A tad bit of stickiness, which I thought worked well in this beer. It sits on the palate nicely and has a pleasant hoppy aftertaste. Great level of carbonation.
D: All around I think this was a great IPA, The hops were a little to big for me to drink this all night long or at a fast pace, but if I were looking for a beer to have with dinner, or just to relax with on a warm day, I would have this again anytime. The alcohol was hidden completely.
To me this beer instantly reminded me of Pliny the Elder...I would call it Pliny's Midwest cousin. It was exceptional. Normally I don't like IPAs that are super hoppy, but this is one that I really did like, despite the dominance of the hops. 1,267 charactersglazeman, Jun 30, 2010

Exceptional beer I give it an A on all aspects. The appearance is a golden hue with a nice firm white head. Smell is citrus all the way with a nice woody earth tone. Taste is out of the world very balanced nice hop to malt ratio for my palet with a hint of oaky smoothness to round out the beer. Mouthfeel is very smooth and silky not to sharp like some IPA's can be. Drinkability this beer I could drink all night but this could get you in trouble due to the higher ABV. Tremedous beer by Three Floyds and I am very happy that our distributors got their act together to bring this beer to the bluegrass. 694 charactersrpardon7, Jun 29, 2010

Appearance is a somewhat cloudy orange/golden color with a very beautiful, full frothy white head. I can smell this beer from a couple feet away. The sweet fruits are very strong. I'm getting a TON of orange and tangerine along with a lot of sweet honey. The hops are not very strong in the scent of this beer. I'm also not getting much pine or floral notes in the nose either. Now to taste this bad boy... Wow, My palate gets hit with some very sweet hops at first. Then it moves to the citrus fruitiness of the orange/tangerine. A bit of grapefruit as well. Then I get some sweet honey on the back of my tongue followed by an amazing hop bitterness. This beer has lived up to the hype for me. Absolutely divine! The mouthfeel is the perfect amount of chewiness for an IIPA. The drinkability is scary how high ABV it is. You can't even taste the alcohol until it warms up a bit and toward the end of every sip. Then u get a little warming sensation going down, but I really like that from an IIPA. OUTSTANDING beer! I think I've tried enough Three Floyds beers now to say they are one of my new favorite breweries. 1,199 charactersDovaliHops, Jun 29, 2010

Pours a honey amber color with about an inch of white head. It doesn't retain, but great lacing. Smells great, tropical fruits and piney hops are flooding my nostrils. I love all the fruit I can smell, this is very attractive to me. I take my first sip and I'm bombarded with a giant hop flavor! After my taste buds become used to the hops I notice the juiciness. Tropical and citrus fruits all over the place. Great mouthfeel, the carbonation is perfect to bring all the great flavors to life. Easy to drink and very refreshing, regardless of the high abv. 633 charactersBendurgin, Jun 29, 2010

Pours hazy orange with a nice fluffy cream-colored head.
Smells of pine up front with a dash of orange peels and citrus.
The taste follows the nose with quite a bit of sweet citrus and pine in the middle. Bitter pine and sweet citrus finish to round things off.
Good mouthfeel for the style, full body with creamy carbonation.

S. Smells of sweet floral hops when the bottle is opened. Out of the glass, the citrus flavors start to shine with lemon and grapefruit peel. As it warms, orange and grapefruit citrus scents emerge as well as peach and mango.
T. A slight honey sweetness upfront and then a tremendous amount of hops come blazing in. The really floral plant nature of the hops shines in the aftertaste - the same after taste you get when you taste fresh hop buds - herbal and bitter. Some sweet carmel and citrus flavors pull through as the beer warms.
M. A bit too thin. The carbonation is so smooth that it's barely detectable. You merely notice the creamy foam that gradually fills your mouth.
D. A very drinkable variety of the style. Slight sweetness with a bitter character that continues to change and develop as the beer warms. 944 charactersBeerAndBourbon, Jun 25, 2010

A: An opaque orange appearance with slight head. Really a different & unique color from other DIPA's that I have had. The head recedes pretty quickly.
S: Awesome citrusy nose with the peach and mango coming through just as the bottle label describes. The smell is very aromatic and amazing. 
T: Hop lover's dream. The immediate citrus flavors of the peach and mango along with the slightly sweet caramel aftertaste is so smooth and complement each other beautifully.
M: Medium mouthfeel with just enough carbonation. 
D: Excellent drinkability for a DIPA. This is a hopbomb for sure! I would drink this again without hesitation. Would love to try on tap.
Summary: If you have an opportunity to try - don't pass this one up! It is everything that one would want in a DIPA. Easily one of my favorites from 3F's. 864 charactershonestdave, Jun 21, 2010

S: Great big citrus hops. Pineapple, mango, and all the rest. Among the most delicious hop aromas I have ever experienced.
T: The bottle says this beer is a hophead's dream, and I would agree. The flavor is a giant hop blast with all the bitterness that goes along with it. Moderate caramel malts and subtle alcohol tones round out the flavor. This is a wonderful IIPA.
M: Rich and very well carbonated, it's well suited to coat everything in its patch with hoppy goodness.

4.37/5  rDev -0.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Sampled at the Brick in DC the other night.
The beer pours a solid orange color with good head retention and lacing. The nose is terrific, and shows a huge hoppy orange citrus component, along with pine and light sweet malt. Flavors replicate the nose pretty closely, though for such a sizeable IPA, I'm very impressed by how well balanced it is. The beer does have a considerable sweet malt component, but it's countered very nicely by the hoppy bitterness in the finish. The combination leads to flavors of orange cherry, mango, vanilla and pine, all ending in a long, refreshing, bitter finish. Mouthfeel is rich with significant sweetness, but the finish is long and lusciously bitter. Alcohol is certainly noticeable in this DIPA, but it really doesn't detract much from the beer's drinkability. That's how delicious this beer is. 
A very impressive DIPA from 3 Floyds. 876 charactersJohn_M, Jun 03, 2010

A - Deep orange-apricot in color, a generous 2-finger foam head forms and is retained well, leaving extensive lacing.
S - Mango, grapefruit, pineapple, some caramel sweetness, and just a hint of grassy hops.
T - Bright, floral sweetness up front, the hop profile asserts itself quickly and dominates the finish. Caramel malt back bone balances nicely throughout.
M - Nothing special, thin-medium body, acceptable levels of carbonation.
D - This is a monster. The relatively high ABV is masked incredibly well, and the bitterness from the hops keeps this compellingly drinkable from start to finish. 647 charactersAJacob81, May 31, 2010

4.55/5  rDev +3.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Hazy golden amber in color with a thick two finger head of tightly laced foam that keeps with incredible persistence. As it (very slowly) recedes there is fat lacing on the glass. 
The nose is bready, malty-caramel with sharp citrusy hops that have a bit of lemon peel and grapefruit. 
Tastes like what an IPA should taste... in all its hopped up glory! Upfront you're hit with robust floral and citrus hops. But this mellows out as a brawny malt backbone eases your stunned palate with sweet bready deliciousness. The finish has a bitter grapefruity flavor that lingers - but definitely leaves you hankering for more. 
I hope it's not the hype or my appreciation to have finally tried this brew, but I think this experience is about as close I've come to a quasi-religious beer moment. 789 charactersGregPearson33, May 29, 2010

Taste was phenomenal, more like PTE than anything I've ever had, but maybe with a little more in the malt. Just all kinds of hoppy pine and citrus tangerine feel to it. Also reminiscient of the Conductor, another excellent beer in this style. Hides alcohol well. Has some of those less cited flavors, maybe mango or apricot behind the scenes. Not really bitter or viscous at all. 564 charactersBeerandraiderfan, May 23, 2010

Bomber split between two shaker glasses for my wife and I to enjoy. Great slightly cloudy orange body has a slightly off-white three finger head sitting on top. Some nice thin lacing is visible throughout the drink. 
The smell on this is amazing! Off the top of my head I don't think I have ever rated a IIPA perfect on smell. This one cannot be improved. HUGE peach aromas are the showpiece with tangerine and wild honey as secondary characteristics. Nothing could make this smell better!
Big whole grapefruit (including the pith) is tasted with big bitter oily hops. Good taste, but doesn't deliver what the smell promised. 
Good scrubbing bubbles make the mouthfeel on this very nice and quite refreshing. 
This is almost 10%! How can that be?! This is refreshing and extremely enjoyable. No gumminess is evident at all. I regret that I don't have another one of these in my fridge. I'm going to have to trade for another one of these soon. Highly recommended. If you can't buy this locally, trade for it...you'll thank yourself for it. 1,114 charactershopsbreath, May 22, 2010
4/5  rDev -8.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Ahhhh - finally! One of my greatest wants! Acquired from gratefulbeerhead so a big BIG THANK YOU goes out to him!
A: This beer pours a hazy burnt orange with a one and a half finger of offwhite rocky head. Head recedes quickly leaving light sheeting of lacing on the glass.
S: Nose is of caramel malts, major piney hops and a touch of citrus.
T: Taste starts with a surprising large dose of caramel malts. They actually somewhat dominate the forefront of this beer. Citrusy hops come in through the middle, lemon and grapefruit are the most prevelent. Finish has a nice grassy hop nature that lingers slightly. 
M: Medium to full body, medium carbonation, a lot of resin and oil on this that coat the tongue.
D: Quite tasty, a little too malty, pretty big kick, I would like to try this again... so I will cross my fingers that I get lucky enough to stumble across another Dreadnaught. 890 charactersJayli, May 20, 2010

This one definitely needs to be re-reviewed... Had fresh at the brewery on DLD. Ratings numbers reflect new review:
A: Same experience as original review
S: Humongous grapefruit bomb! Loved every bit of it. Malt still has a nice presence, but damn this is hop forward!
T: Outstanding. This beer is obviously uber fresh and my previous was not so much. Citrus hops galore... Love it. Alcohol is not nearly as present as previously noted
M: Same experience as previously noted
D: I want more. ABV is no longer an issue, it is dangerously drinkable fresh!
5/15/09
22oz bottle poured into a tumbler.
A: Very much a golden amber, more golden than amber. Fluffy thick, billowy somewhat tannish head - at least two fingers thick. Head dissipates after a minute or two, leaving lots of sudsy lacing.
S: Little disappointing here. Maybe an oldish bottle? Wish there was a bottled on date somewhere to know for sure. There's a hop nose, but I'm getting stronger doses of alcohol phenols and biscuity tones from the malt.
T: Feeling a little better about this one, good citrus hop presence initially, followed by sticky, resinous pine notes, slight bittering. The malt base is similar to the Alpha King in that it is sturdy but more earthy and bready than sweet. Faint touch of caramel. Alcohol is very present, not very well hidden.
M: Very good, big body, chewy, resinous and creamy smooth. Really coats the palate, definitely a plus for this beer.
D: Suffers from the high abv, would 8% better suit this brew? 
Middle of the road DIPA for me. I'm in the minority here, but give me the crisp hop presence and drinkability of Alpha King over this one. I dig it, but it doesn't all come together for me like the King. 1,726 charactersbwd110, May 19, 2010

4.65/5  rDev +5.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5A- Pours golden orange in color. Produces a massive foamy head. Good retention and a crazy amount of lacing left behind.
S- Hops, hops, hops! Citrus, floral scents, pine and a bit of sweet malt.
T- I'm really blown away by this DIPA! Grapefruit, orange zest, and of course BIG hops. Then all of a sudden I get the sweetness of the malts that almost tastes like caramel. It's seriously an epic blend of flavors.
To date I have ALWAYS measured all other DIPA's to DFH 90 min. It has always been my favorite go to beer. I always proclaimed "it's so well balanced". I was wrong!
whereas 90 min gives you a wave of hops, then malt, and back, Dreadnaught IS balance!!! You cannot quite discern between the hops and malt, yet they both SHINE at the same time... CRAZY awesome beer!!!
M- Nice and crisp at first and then it's almost creamy. Perfect level of carbonation. I wish I had more.
D- I only had one of these (can't buy them in KS) 
I split this with a beer-buddy and after one sip I regretted that! I wanted MORE!
I would have bet the farm that this was a 7% beer!
Seriously my new favorite beer of all time!!!

4/5  rDev -8.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Thanks to capra12 for this one. Shared with a couple of housemates. Poured from a 22oz. bomber into a Sam Adams perfect pint. 
A: Gentle pour yields a 1 finger, frothy white head with excellent retention. Beer is a clear orange-yellow. Lacing is stringy and patchy with moderate cling. 
S: Caramel, citrus, pine, and cane sugar. Also, is it just me or do I smell onions and garlic... kinda throws me off but its definitely one of the most unique and powerful noses on a IIPA. 
T: Brown sugar, citrus, pine, cane sugar, slight hop tartness from the middle to the end. Finish is messy and leaves a balanced malt/hop aftertaste. 
M: Medium bodied, carbonated, and rather smooth. Lively but not as crisp as I'd like. Still very easy drinking and it warms the palate. Finish is messy with a slight aftertaste. 
D: Definitely a solid IIPA but not worth the hype surrounding it in my opinion. It's up there though. Great balance here as its neither a hop, nor malt bomb. Easily one of the easier to drink IIPAs. Seek it out but don't give away house and home for it! 1,064 charactersSpeedwayJim, May 13, 2010
4.38/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Picked up a bottle on my Monday Wisconsin Mini-haul. 22 oz. bottle poured into a tulip.
A: Deep golden hue with a slight haze. About a finger-thick off-white head holds nicely on the surface. Lacing is excellent as well.
S: Some sweet honeyed malt character is hidden by a nosefull of citrusy, piney hop notes. There are also some fruity aromas lingering in the backround.
T: A very well-balanced DIPA. Biscuity malt flavors with a touch of honey interact with resinous hops. Potent hints of grapefruit, mango, apricot, and nectarine lead the way to an insanely long, bitter finish.
M: Full-bodied, with an oily hop presence, yet very smooth and silky. 
D: Although the hop flavors are intense, it's still very easy to drink, as it doesn't bruise the palate like some other brews of the same style. One hell of a DIPA! 823 charactersWYVYRN527, May 10, 2010
4.22/5  rDev -3.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5On tap at the Mikkeller bar. 
Pale amber color with a nice white head. 
The aroma packed with fresh hops - grapefruits, grass, pine-needles and hop resins. Caramel malts back it up. Very inviting and aromatic. 
The flavor has some caramel malty sweetness to it and minimal hints of vanilla fudge. But the star of the show is definitely the fresh hop aromas of grapefruits, mango, grass, pine-needles and resins. Ends really bitter with a strong piny character. 
Full body, crisp and semi-sticky texture. 
Good stuff. Dangerously easy to drink. 548 charactersricke, May 09, 2010
4.48/5  rDev +2.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Poured from a 22 oz. bottle into a tulip. 
Appearance: Dreadnaught pours an amber tangerine color with a strong 4 cm white head. Great retention, especially for a DIPA, and sticky lace all over the glass.
Smell: There are some sweet caramel malt notes, but this a hop-centric beer. Pleasant aroma of tangerine, mango, grapefruit, and apricot hops. 
Taste: Lightly sweet all the way through, even with the hop assault. A variety of citrus flavors - orange and grapefruit mostly, as well as peach and some floral notes. Very strong and robust flavor. I love it. The alcohol is completely hidden. How, I have no idea. Mildly bitter aftertaste. 
Mouthfeel: How is Dreadnaught this creamy? It is so smooth, so so creamy. Lightly carbonated, but it suits the flavor quite well. The strong hops leave my tongue tingling with a slightly oily residue. Fairly subdued, given the flavor.
Drinkability: Just keep it coming. I have a weak spot for DIPAs, and this is one of the best I have had. With a great taste and incredible smoothness, this is a very drinkable brew. The alcohol is not even noticeable, except for the pleasant warming of the stomach. Delicious. I drank this solo, but it would be a great pairing for some spicy food. 1,230 charactersKickInTheChalice, May 06, 2010
4.58/5  rDev +4.3%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Ideal look for a DIPA; pale amber with a two inch white head that leaves great lacing.
I've had this several times before and don't remember it smelling this good. Fresher bottle, perhaps? Brimming with bright florals, hints of evergreen, alcohol, and citrus.
The taste throws a lot to think about at you all at once. Orange blossom honey, gentle florals, orange and peach citrus, and a gentle kiss of bitterness just as you think it's not going to show. A nearly perfect combination for me. The mouthfeel couldn't be any softer for a DIPA.
When it's fresh, there's nothing to dislike about this beer. Sold. 610 charactersbrownbeer, May 06, 2010
4.36/5  rDev -0.7%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5A- Beautiful yellow orange color with half a finger to one finger of white frothy head with a beautiful sticky lacing across the glass. Head holds well making this an incredibly good looking beer. 
S- Screams hops and bitter tones that form with citrus tones to increase any hop heads desire to try. Subtle malty sweetness can be detected lingering between the dominating hop smell.
T- A smooth malty sweetness begins this beer as it suddenly smacks the palate with a variety of hop flavors ranging from citrus and floral to some earthy tastes. Mild amount of alcohol detectable through everything else going on in the beer. The beer moves slighty back to the malty side before finishes with a lasting hop bitterness that leaves you wanting another taste.
M- Medium body along with a medium amount of carbonation that makes this a satisfying I.P.A.
D- Incredibly smooth in result of the malt backbone that makes this very drinkable as the harsh bitterness is subdued. I would love for this to be a staple beer in my fridge during the summer, but sadly I live in Ohio. 1,071 charactersLolli1315, May 04, 2010
4.2/5  rDev -4.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Enjoyed on tap at the 3 Floyds brewpub during Dark Lord Day '10. 
Clear dark yellow, with a big sticky white head that leaves sheets of lace. 
The nose is super sweet, with aromas of orange and lime and a nice caramel backbone. 
Drinks like a grapefruit: waves of sweetness wash ashore first, followed closely by a bracing yet enjoyable bitterness. Flavors of dry wheat, coriander and watermelon all make appearances. Delicious. 
The body is medium-full with a silky smoothness, but the peppery carbonation is just a shade on the abusive side. 
I had heard good things about this one from other BAs, and I see their adulation was not misplaced. If I hadn't blown my allotment on all my DL bottles, I would've bought a case. 728 charactersPhelps, May 04, 2010
4.2/5  rDev -4.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 422 oz bottle (thanks to a trade w. Brundo4) into a Duvel tulip.
Poured a cloudy orange with a one-finger head. Lacing was thinner but hung around throughout. Good carbonation was evident. Taste was a nice progression, with a hop hit, orange, mango and licorice up front and a peppery, spicey finish with dry bitterness (not unpleasant). Mouthfeel was creamy, oily and medium or even thinner. The 9.5% isn't obvious in any aspect. This IS an interesting beer and tasty for sure. Not my favorite DIPA but a really good one for sure. 530 charactersregspeir, May 03, 2010
4.28/5  rDev -2.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 422oz bottle courtesy of Wadsey. Thanks a bunch.
Poured into a snifter. 
A-Vigorous pour led to a thick, substantial slightly off white head with some large bubbles. Not really shy about hanging around either. Head recedes very slowly, leaving islands of foam floating on the deep orange liquid. Lacing clings stubbornly to the sides of the glass.
S-Lots of pungent hop aroma. Lots of citrus - grapefruit and orange - along with some grassy and piny undertones. 
M-Hops explode upon the tongue. Follows the nose. Lots of citrusy hops and pine followed by some balancing malt sweetness. I get more orange and grapefruit in there. Finishes with a bitter dose of hops. Not an overly complex brew, but the balance between the hops and malt sweetness is very nearly perfect. Neither really overshadows the other, but both hold their own. I love this.
M-Carbonation is spot on, and creates a very nice texture. Mouthfeel is on the thick side, full bodied, and somewhat sticky. 
D-For the ABV, this is dangerously drinkable. I had no problem finishing the bomber. The alcohol is well hidden; really no hotness to speak of. The thick mouthfeel may discourage more than one bomber though. 
I will definitely have to acquire more of this in future trades. 1,251 charactersjavincik, May 02, 2010

Aroma is mainly citrus hoppy along with some yeast and malt. Flavor is like aroma but yeast comes out more. Full mouth feel and good carbonation. A little bittersweetness at the end along with some alcohol. For some reason this beer, while technically great, doesn't quite ring my bell although I generally really like the Floyd's beer. 439 charactersdrpimento, May 01, 2010

S: wow, smells fantastic. very strong earthy, pine, citrus (orange, grapefruit)hops. Malts are present but serve as slaves to the hops
T: like the smell, hops hit the tongue first and dance on the pallet. oily, bitter and dry but hints of sweet malts on the back-end. perfect balance
M: great carbonation and a nice full body. rich, creamy, dry, bitter, oily....complex...wonderful
D: insanely drinkable for 9.5% abv. alcohol is almost unnoticeable. maybe on the way down it warms the throat but not at all over powering.
Overall, absolutely wonderful DIPA! Oh how I wish I had access to this beer all the time. One of my top 5 DIPA I have ever had the pleasure to try. 776 charactersCosmoHopHead, Apr 30, 2010
4.37/5  rDev -0.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4I brought a couple bombers back from DLD. Here we go.
A - Slightly burnt orange with some golden highlights. Big, creamy off-white head that looks like it should lace great. We'll see.
S - Ahh, now this is fresh. Tons of citrus fruits. Oranges, grapefruit, and while there was a huge burst of literally fresh mango on opening the bottle, it's not as dominant now, but it's still there. Rarely, if ever, have I gotten that in any IPA. On top of that, it's really dank with that great potent grassiness.
T - The absolute best thing about the taste is that it has that same fresh mango character that's present in the smell. I have no clue how the hell Three Floyds does this. It's similar in some sense to the huge pineapple notes found in fresh Hopslam. From there, it follows the nose pretty much to a tee. Lots of citrus(columbus...centennial...like I know...). Malt is literally barely there, just slightly noting itself in the background with a light, sweet breadiness.
MF - Oily, resinous, and incredibly sticky. Basically everything I'd ask for from the style.
D - Well, one bomber is definitely enough. The alcohol is incredibly well hidden, but you certainly feel it. Bravo to Three Floyds on this. I think it competes really well with Hopslam and Double Trouble. 1,275 charactersHitokiriNate85, Apr 30, 2010

S- A great burst of citrus hops and nice tropical fruits. A little bit of grapefruit and some nice pineapple. A beer that once it comes within arm's length, you can pick it up right away. A small hint of malt and no alcohol whatsoever.
T- Like the nose, big hops but a little sweeter than others. The pineapple and citrus makes this a good one. Really no malt to speak of but not a one flavor beer. 
M- A nice bite but not as extreme as others. A good amount of carbonation and a little bit oily. The oiliness adds a bit to the smoothness.
D- For it being a high ABV, this goes down as easy as they come. No problem putting a few back at a time. A great offering from 3F. 788 charactersWisconsinality, Apr 29, 2010

4.37/5  rDev -0.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Bomber received in a trade, split with cbutova and atremains. Pours coppery orange, small creamy white head. Sticks around decently and leaves some lacing. The scent is great, fruity IPA scents of citrus, lemon, mango, tropical-ness. Taste doesn't match the fruitiness of the nose. At first I get alot of floral notes, citrus, and some pine with a nice caramel malt. More fruitiness comes into play later on with a really great mango taste and tons more citrus. Caramel is a bit part of the taste but hops are definitely king here. Reminds me of 90 min IPA. Mouthfeel is very good, creamy and fluffy with good carbonation. A little booze bite but not much. Very light fruit taste, almost tart, in the finish. 708 charactersChico1985, Apr 25, 2010
4.32/5  rDev -1.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4First beer of the night for an awesome three beer tasting. Thanks to Chico1985 for trading for and sharing this one. Reviewed from last night's notes. Poured out a golden-yellow-orange with a head of about one to two fingers that has decent retention. The head is off-white and looks creamy but a bit bubbly also. Thick lace is left on spots of the glass and a fine cloud of white bubbles is left on top of the beer. Smells of lots of fruit hops (mango, pineapple, orange), citrus peel, some pine and earthy hop notes and a bit of caramel malt. The hops do a good job of fulfilling my needs. I even get some white grape hints. According to a friend's mom, "it smells like aftershave." Taste is also good. The hops are more piney and earthy in the taste than in the nose. I get grassy notes as well. The hop bitterness is medium-high and at a level that I enjoy. The white grape juice notes become present at higher levels as well. The fruit/citrus hop notes (mango, lemon, orange) come in bigger as I get further into my glass. The caramel malt rounds out the beer in a nice way. Apple notes even become present at some point. Mouthfeel is moderate bodied with medium level of carbonation. It feels nice for the big flavors. The warmth is of a low level and feels like less than 9.5% ABV. The bitterness lasts long on the palate but at a good IIPA level. The body is moderately creamy but a bit more wouldn't hurt. Drinkability is good. The price ($10) is nice for a huge beer with great flavors and well hidden ABV. The bitterness would get to me after a while but I wouldn't session it anyways. A nice balanced IIPA. 1,618 characterscbutova, Apr 24, 2010

The flavor has everything the aroma promises. Grapefruit, oranges, pineapple, peach, mango, pine, and a nice combination of bitterness and sweetness. This comes together beautifully.
Full bodied, wonderfully sweet and bitter at the same time, and well carbonated. It is hard to believe this beer is 9.5 % because it is so smooth and easy to drink. I am glad I was able to buy this in Hudson, WI, which is a relatively short drive. I will be going back for more. 675 charactershardy008, Apr 23, 2010

Smells of intense piney and citrusy blast right to the nose hair. WHOA! This ought to be good. 
Yep, I was right, this is good. Citrusy and piney at the same time. Insanely hoppy but the malt is in there in the right proportions to carry the hops right along. How did they mask the booze so well?
Mouthfeel was nice and slick, oily almost but not in the motor oil type of way. Mainly hop extract juice it seems. 
I Would like to drink this all day but I Couldn't because of the alcohol and the palate fatigue. Pretty darn enjoyable, though.
I've said it once and I'll say it again, I think this is the best beer brewed in Indiana. Give me more. 783 characterslivewire78, Apr 16, 2010

22oz bomber into a Snifter Glass

T- Creamy malts hit me up front but them FFF citrus hops slammed the backround with bitterness. 
M- Medium body with with moderate carbonation and a strong bitter dry finish. 
I was real surprised by the amount of malts in this brew, but they definitely still blended them in well. Hell I think Alpha King had more hops. Oh well, still an excellent DIPA. Something different

Poured out of a 22 oz bomber into my Delirium Tremens snifter glass
A - Pours a cloudy pale orange color with less than a finger width of head. The head settles quickly, and nice lacing is left on my glass as I drink.
S - Smell is of floral and grassy hops mixed with some sweet tropical fruit. Not overpowering, but delightful none the less.
T - Definitely some bitterness from the hops smacks the old palate around right away. The typical grapefruit taste of IPAs is definitely there. the malts balance out the hops nicely for a crisp finish
M - Medium body with a creamy mouthfeel and not overly carbonated. Well done, three floyds. well done.
D - Yes please, may I have another. What, I'm in CA? Damn. Please trade me more. 907 charactersKaiser81, Apr 01, 2010

A: Somewhat dark orange/amber color that leaves a 1 finger white head, if only briefly. I get some spotted lacing around the glass
S: A very nice blend of citrus (lemon and orange), pine and a little malt. Excited to try this one...
T: ...and the taste let me down. There is a fairly big malt presence which I wasn't expecting. Also a presence of grass which leaves a funny aftertaste. The hops are pretty faded compared to the smell. This isn't an old bottle, so I'm not sure what happened
M: Light bodied, crisp and nicely carbonated. Leaves a weird aftertaste (dirt?) and good deal of bitterness on the tongue
D: Easy to drink from an ABV standpoint (9.5%), but not from a taste standpoint. Like I mentioned above, I traded for this shortly after it hit the shelves and it only sat in my fridge for a few weeks. Since it's not easily obtainable, I probably won't be seeking it out again 987 charactersBrez07, Mar 31, 2010

Taste - Citrus Rind, apricots, mangoes, not nearly as much as much sweetness as compared to other popular dipas , very astringent an absolute hop bomb, bitterness on the back of the tongue, taste ends very quickly and unexpectedly, not much aftertaste at all, no boozyness to speak of
Mouthfeel - Very appropriate carbonation for this beer, smooth, goes down very easy.
Drinkability - Very good drinkability for a double IPA, could drink this very often if availible in the area. 647 charactersmacmaster761, Mar 31, 2010

A- Pours golden orange in color. Produces a massive foamy head from a semi aggressive pour. Good retention and a stupid amount of lacing left behind.
S- Hop heaven! Citrus, floral scents, pinetrees and a bit of cweet malt.
T- I'm really blown away by this DIPA! Grapefruit, orange zest, and of course BIG hops. Then all of a sudden I get the sweetness of the malts that almost tastes like caramel. It's seriously an epic blend of flavors. I am gonna have to do a side by side of this and Hopslam next year. I almost think I like it more than Hopslam and that is saying ALOT!
M- Nice and crisp at first and then it's almost creamy. Perfect level of carbonation. I wish I had more. 
D- I gave it a 5 for good reason! I would happily drink this all night. 842 charactersurwithdave, Mar 30, 2010

Touch of vanilla on the tongue, then a long bitter finish. Fantastic imperial and the only knock against it is that the alcohol is a bit too heavy and present. 286 charactersChrisPro, Mar 29, 2010

the red-orange glow emanates from the tulip, i look back to the deranged men on the bottle, searching for wisdom. i find none. merely a well balanced big ipa in a glass. the sweetness of the malts is apparent, playing off the dancing fruits and the hop resin. mandarin or mango, perhaps an amalgamation. everything blends well to mask the alcohol within, which becomes apparent when i realize i've not eaten lunch.. a very solid offering from the fine folks in indiana. 518 charactersolympuszymurgus, Mar 28, 2010

It smelled of sweet citrus hops, mango (some got the mango some didn't), caramel, malty and earthy. It tasted more citrus hops than tropical and bitter. It was incredibly smooth for being 9.5% and had a light aftertaste. 306 charactersfemALEist, Mar 25, 2010

N. Crazy Fruits...Mango and Peach subtle hops and caramel
Alright I think this tasting took me a total of a full hour. This is such a complex beer, I wanted to taste it cold, and allow it to warm up to get the entire spectrum of flavor. Cold I got a lot of fruit, heavy caramel and a tad bit of alcohol. Warm I got a balanced blend of caramel and sweetness from fruit (sweet mango), and a touch of alcohol. This is really an interesting beer. The label doesn't lie..."IT'S NOT NORMAL". This is my first introduction to Three Floyds and I think I found my new favorite brewery, sorry Magic Hat. WHAT?!? Magic Hat? Yep, The thing I love about Magic Hat, now Three Floyds, and even Cigar City is the fact that they don't brew "normal" beers. They are flavored a bit off, and the breweries seem to take more of a risk and somehow it works. Once again this beer was part of a trade. I look forward to getting my hands on some more next year! 956 charactersDosBeerigos, Mar 25, 2010

22oz bottle, Delerium tulip
A: Dark amber core, a hazy golden color around the edges. Head quickly dissipated into a whispy cap, excellent sticky lacing - highlighted almost every sip.
S: Exploding with citrus hops, pine trees, bready malt. Quite potent and distinct - exactly what im looking for in a DIPA.
T: Fruity hops, oily coating pine resin. Sweet caramelized malt complimented with some floral/grassy undertones. Well balanced, barely a hint of alcohol. Finishes semi dry and bitter, Im ready for the next sip. 
M: Medium bodied, medium to low carbonation. The hop profile presents itself as resiny and coating...so smooth.
D: This is quaff-able without a doubt, but it has enough character to keep you sipping on this for a while if you choose. I had half of my bottle with dinner, and the other half to enjoy afterwards. 
Overall, an excellent, well balanced DIPA. 896 characterszoolzoo, Mar 24, 2010
3.83/5  rDev -12.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4On tap at the brewpub, poured into a half pint glass (uh, how cute)
The color is that of slightly dull & muted burnt copper with a few lighter-hued highlights around the bottom of the glass. Tobacco burst appearance. The pour offered a ½ inch head that dissipates pretty quickly. Despite thin retention, lacing is actually very good & solid.
Dreadnaught smells of dense & juicy hops. Potent notes of pine tar & earthy, floral tones (floral aromas become much more notable as it warms). Also prominent is a lot of citric goodness - grapefruit, lemon zest & orange peel. There isn't too much malt to be found.
Pine hits give way to floral overtones followed by notes of peely, pithy & zesty citrus; mostly grapefruit & lemon. The flavor profile is pretty good in terms of hoppiness, but it just seems lacking in bitterness, in my opinion. It exhibits reasonable bitterness - which improves with warmth - but falls too far short of the harsh, gnashing of teeth I like from my DIPAs. To its credit, this beer is much drier than I would have expected, with just a faint sweetness hanging in the back. 
Dreadnaught is moderately heavy & medium bodied with appropriately low carbonation. It's definitely a dense beer; very resinous & gritty. Lingering on the finish is a pine tar bitterness. I just wish it was more prominent to taste.
Drinkability is good; it's certainly not lacking flavor. Far from disappointing, it simply did not blow my mind. Still, I reckon it's pretty good. What the hell is up with the dainty half pint, though? We're all adults here; I think we can handle a full pint. 1,594 charactersRyan011235, Mar 24, 2010

I always questioned to whether or not it was worth the price when I could get a 6 pack of alpha king for the same price. This is 100% worth it. I haven't never bought a bomber from FFF and been disappointed. 
This brew got a perfect 5 on the nose from me. It is like getting pricked with pine needles while squirting citrus in your wounds! It follows through to the palate and is the ideal Imperial IPA in my beer journey thus far. This beer is full of gypsy and jesus tears. Never a let down, FFF. 618 characterstippebrewcrew2, Mar 23, 2010

S: huge onslaught of hops on the front- pine needles and citrus, a sweet malty profile sits beneath the assertive hop profile. This one smells like hop heaven. 
T: the order of flavors goes citrus, pine, then a toasty malt profile with a hint of sweetness followed by heat on the end. The hop profile takes center stage- everything about this beer is delicious.
MF: higher carbonation with a pretty thick body, the combo works for the beer
D: Wow.. nothing like a glass of fresh Dreadnaught. Certainly an excellent DIPA that is a bit more piney and bitter than Hopslam or Double Trouble, but also has a bigger malt presence. 705 charactershomebrew311, Mar 22, 2010

Smells strongly of citrusy, grapefruit hops with a slight caramel sweetness.
Taste is full-on bitter grapefruit upfront which subsides into a good balance of roasted caramel malt. Bitter, hoppy finish that lingers nicely. On the first pour I was getting some floural/piney hops in the finish, but not any more. 
Mouthfeel is medium bodied with good carbonation.
Really smooth and easy to drink with a nice balance of hops and malts. 501 characterssidetracked, Mar 20, 2010

S- Good sweet malt backbone with great hop pfofile coming through mainly as citrus an tropical fruits, there's also some pine notes here bu mainly fruit.
T- pretty similar to the nose. the hops dance around for the whole experience, backed by some nice malty sweetness. alot of nice citrus and tropical fruit flavors up front, some pine mixes in all backed by the malty sweetness, then finishes nice with a nice crispy bitterness.

Slightly hazy orange color. Large, creamy white head is clumpy like mashed 'taters. Head never really leaves just diminishes a bit than rides the retention elevator to glass bottom. Drops lace rings off at each floor. I like this metaphor. 
I like sticking my nose in a glass and thinking of adjectives like "hop euptopia," "hop symphony," or even "hop jazz quartet" etc. Sweet fruity malt, pine, and candy tropical fruit hops like resiny hop sap, pink grapefruit and mango candy slices.
Hop flavor from beginning to end. Let's see, I spy resiny pine sap hops with more tropical fruit hops with some pink grapefruit hops and even a little bit of lemon sugar bittersweet hop. Thick, cakelike malt with a boozey accompanyment--like a vodka soaked cake. 
Heavy malt character weighs down the hops somewhat in my opinion. 831 charactersdonkeyrunner, Mar 17, 2010

Pours out a pure orange color with the smell of oranges, apricot, and other fruit yet to be determined. 
The taste is overwhelmingly fruity with a nice finish that sticks around for you to enjoy a good time longer. The alcohol is hidden so well, I am half tempted to just slam glass after glass with no regards to it's capacity. I can't fullCy express how delicious this beer is. 
I must say this is the finest example of what I consider an American DIPA that I have found. The start to finish of this treasure is pure enjoyment. I would absolutely make this an everyday beer if not for the price, but given the opportunity to have this on hand, I will stock up my share. Those of you not fortunate enough to get this in your area, make a concerted effort to get your hands on a bottle or 2.

After having this many times from the bottle, really wanted to try it on tap to pretty much assure I was getting a very fresh pour...
Pours a golden yellow with good clarity, a nice two finger fluffy white head develops and sticks around for a while, some lacing is left as I drink...
Smell is wonderful, citrusy hops, pineapple with some piny/resin hop aromas as well. Good amount of sweet malt is noticeable in the nose as well, a bit of alcohol, but gives the impression that I will soon be tasting one fine tasting, well balanced brew...
Nice earthy/floral hop bitterness right up front, piny and thick hop oil/resin taste. Some citrus hop character shows through, grapefruit and a bit of pineapple. Malt character shows, adding some nice substance and thickness, really balances out the brew perfectly...
Medium bodied but nice and chewy from the abundance of resiny hops and good amount of sweet malt. Carbonation is right on making for a well coating, easy drinking beer...alcohol is non-existent...
Wonderful, could drink these all night, the alcohol is so well hidden behind a fully flavored, perfectly balanced hoppy beer that it becomes dangerous after a while, you forget you are enjoying a near 10% beer...Three Floyds really nailed this one! 1,463 charactershawks10, Mar 14, 2010
4.74/5  rDev +8%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Revisiting an old friend....
This Dreadnaught pours with moderate to light carbonation, but the bottle has been open awhile. Color is a fairly clear deep gold. Really wonderful aroma of fruits and spices; peach, tangerine, frankincense, vanilla and God knows what else. This bottle has warmed up quite a bit and the carbonation has diminished somewhat leaving me with a very silky Dreadnaught. Very complex fruit and spice flavors are delicately woven into the malt backbone of this beer. While sipping this I actually flash back to an IPA from Minnesota, Masala Mama, which I haven't had for a couple years. There's this sort of burnt caramel sort of flavor that surfaces in Dreadnaught. I love how the malt and hops flavors mix and create such a tasty combination in this beer. There's just something about this perfect combination of hops and malt in this beer that induces joy. Still my favorite DIPA. 906 charactersmarcobrau, Mar 13, 2010

It smells very strongly of piney hops and grapefruit that remind me of something I would crave on cool spring afternoon (who are we kidding cool spring morning, noon, afternoon, evening, night, midnight, early morning).
Sweet grapefruit citrus flavor up front with the hop grassy like bitterness takes most of my attention after that.
Mouthfeel is thick dry and wet all at the same time. I don't think they could have packed anymore hops into this beer with out the bottle exploding.
One of the most refreshing, bitter sweet, citrusy DIPA's out there. The 9.5% ABV doesnt even begin to show its head making you want to drink glass after glass after glass.
Now I am going to enjoy my second glass from the bomber and then most likely cry because I only have one. 854 charactersJoePat, Mar 13, 2010

A-Pours a golden/orange with a thin white head that faded quick but left decent lacing.
S-Citrus hops, not overpowering, but noticeable with a sweet malt aroma as well.
T-Bitter, citrus hops, a bit of pine resin and alcohol, caramel malt. Its definitely a DIPA, but is more toward the balanced side than many.
M-Crisp carb bite, yet slick and a bit creamy. Medium body.
D-Big yet drinkable. Had no problem finishing the bomber, but one was enough.
Overall, I think this beer is a bit overhyped. Its certainly a good beer, but I can think of many other DIPAs I'd rather have. 616 charactersLerxst, Mar 10, 2010

Cloudy amber with little to no head. Aromas of sugary hop candy, citrus peals, green apple and leafy buds. Palate is sharp and bitter, sweet and round. The hops show signs of ageing a little, but this beer is going strong. Like fresh squeezed hop-aid. Bitter-sweet, lime-y and delicious.

Poured into a tulip. Beer was a nice dark golden/amber color with decent head. Some nice lacing left on the glass. Smell is wonderful. Nice citrus whiffs with a malt presence to fill it out. I personally felt that the smell was the best part of the beer. The taste was less of a palate assault and more of a journey in picking out the flavors. As it warmed the citrus opened up and got flavors of apricot and melon. The ABV hides itself well and the beer is very drinkable.Again there is a nice malt presence that makes this beer well balanced. I was glad to get to try this one. 615 charactersRbald42, Mar 04, 2010

S- The smell is the best part of this beer, endging out the taste. I first got mango, and then grapefruit. There was a little pine. 
T- Tasted the mango first and then the tart pine lingered on the tongue. the sweet caramel backbone to this beer balanced out so well that I understand the hype around this brew now. The alcohol was slightly warming but almost nonexistent. 
M- Good modorate carbonation. with a nice thick malt that gives the beer a body.

Smell is not as intensely hoppy as I expected, but still quite good. Seems to intensify and become more interesting as it warms up. The usual IPA aromas, but a little more complex and perhaps more balanced- hops, pineapple, citrus, banana, pine, and a little malt backbone.
Taste is very good- malty, brief sweet flash followed by a hoppy, bitter finish. Faint citrus and pineapple. Alcohol well-concealed.
Mouthfeel is crisp and prickly, a'elr fresh.
Very drinkable as well; I'd drink this one all night I had enough.

Smell of grapefruit explosion, orange, caramel, sweet malt and some bitterness. Taste very similar, tons of citrus and grapefruit flavors, a nice sweet finish with very little astringency. One of the better DIPA's that i have had. THere do not seem to be any off flavors and everything tastes surprisingly balanced for a 9.5 DIPA.

I was worried before opening it that the hops might have faded some, however after tasting I'm fairly certain they did not. 22 oz. bottle shared 3 ways, and poured into a tulip. 
Dreadnaught pours a delicious looking clear golden orange with a substantial white head...I can't really put into words how delicious this beer looks in the glass. Smells of fresh citrusy hops. The taste is very bitter, juicy hops with a sweet sticky honey and malt background. The sweet honey taste reminds me somewhat of hopslam. Drinks like a great DIPA should. You could put down 3 pints of this pretty quickly without realizing it...and then all of a sudden get hit with the alcohol all at once. Overall, a great DIPA. 818 charactersShumista, Feb 08, 2010

A - two fingers of rich, tight and frothy just slightly off-white foam sits atop a magnificently golden colored clear liquid. as the foam slowly recedes, it covers the glass in a thin layer of lacing.
S - smells of sweet candied grapefruit and citrus...ever so slightly soapy. more grapefruit and melon, wow! ever so slight cracker and caramel underneath.
T - taste is a bit more bittering than the nose, still a massive amount of grapefruit, quite the alcohol punch (and subsequent burn). pine and caramel joined in by a tad bit of soap as well.
M - medium bodied and quite oily and slick, flavors just slide around your mouth. nice carbonation, noticeable but not distracting.

Picked up two bottles of this while visiting family in Cincinnati, OH (technically purchased in Bellevue, KY at the Party Source). One shattered, leaving this my only taste of this nectar for quite some time...
Note: possible comparisons to Avery's Maharaja may ensue in this review...it is my atm favorite DIPA
A: Gorgeous orange color, but completely transparent (Maharaja has an impenetrably cloudy body...). The lacing doesn't die. Period. It's practically still hugging the rim and is extremely thick in some parts.
S: Mango hops dominate the nose.
T: Sweet, juicy peach hops dominate the immediate taste with a huge citrus aftertaste (leaving just enough hop drymouth, but not too much)
M: Smooth, creamy, nicely-carbonated sailing all the way through this beer. As I mentioned, the drymouth aftertaste isn't puckering; in a way it leaves your mouth watering for more.
D: Savoring this one is gonna be hard.
Overall: Absolutely loved it; would have absolutely loved to drink my other bottle. But there are many DIPAs that will suitably quench my thirst. This is a nice treat, but it's not irreplaceable. 1,216 charactersvdoz3, Feb 05, 2010
4.4/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Thanks to MasterSki for providing a new trader with this beverage feast I've long desired.
The pour produces a light amber, cloudy, thick looking beauty. An inch of off-white foam floats atop. This quickly reduces to an active skim. A swirl of the tulip leaves sheets of finely bubbled lace. Nice.
The smell is a full aroma of citrus (orange, orange peel, grapefruit), lightly tart yeast notes. There's some nice florality to it, and the sweet is elusive. Very light notes of earth and bitter turn this bouquet into a complex perfume. Outstanding.
The taste is just magnificent, full of bold flavors that somehow balance. It sweeps gracefully onto the palate with notes of neutral sweet, light yeast, and light citrus. Then this wolf of a beer tears off its sheep's clothing. The mild citrus becomes a beast of clean flavor, it growls with resinous pine. Herbal bitter grows from gentle floral notes into a massive and tasty finish of citrus, pine, and bitter. The balance here is elusive, but there is a sweet to it that lasts, and even the mild yeast notes hang through the sip, the tart of them turning this into a complex and wonderful animal. The warmer this beer gets, the better, and at near to room temperature it is just a masterpiece of bold flavor.
This is a big beer, and in some ways it drinks very full bodied, in other ways it is surprisingly light in mouth. Low carb. and perfect, very viscous, and a long finish that is really delicious. Clean and bright all the way.
This brew is best slowly sipped, so as to let it warm, and to appreciate it. But it's big and drinks smaller than that, so I rate it highly here too.
Impression: Do you like American DIPA's? Do what it takes to get this beer, you will not be disappointed. I hope to get this again. 1,772 characterscavedave, Feb 01, 2010
3.98/5  rDev -9.3%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a bomber into a tulip. Thanks, rnorgart!
Orange-amber pour. Cautious pour yields little head, but bubbles rise throughout. Retention is pretty good, and there's some nice lacing on the glass.
Malty sweet and citric hop nose. Pretty standard IPA aroma. Nothing really noteworthy or standout about it.
The flavor follows that simple formula. Sweet caramel and citrus up front. Then a sharp citric/pine finish. Slight touch of heat in the finish.
Medium-heavy body. Smooth, somewhat slick texture. Very easy drinker. Pretty good balance. Good hop flavor and a solid DIPA. 584 charactersGyle41386, Jan 30, 2010
4.45/5  rDev +1.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5From a bottle into a tulip.
Pours a hazy, deep golden color. Very dense inch of white foam that leaves significant lacing.
Very citrusy - lime and grapefruit on the nose as well as some more exotic mango and lychee. Very sweet, but there's enough bitter to really balance against it. I don't get much hop or alcohol presence, but it is a DIPA.
Full of lemon zest and grapefruit peel. Not as sweet as the nose would have led me to believe, but it's very tasty. A hint of the sweet tropical fruit (mango, a touch of pineapple) and a firm, but understated bitter alpha acid flavor. A hint of chemical/turpentine and a little bit of malt under all that. Well balanced, delicious beer.
I wanted a little more "fuzz" to the beer, but that's hard at this level of alcohol. Either way, it's quite easy to drink, especially considering that nearly 10% abv. Very good. 862 charactersBillyBoysPie, Jan 30, 2010
3.92/5  rDev -10.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3Taken from notes
Pours a medium hazy golden color with some orange hues. Head is that of two inches and is slightly off white. Great head retention with quarter inch staying a top float of the beer.
Huge citrus smell is coming off this beer. I'm getting tangerines, grapefruit, and apricots. Some bread like malts can be slightly detected also in the smell.
Taste is bitter upfront that moves into a citrus burst and finishes off with a hint of bread like malts to try and balance it out.
Full bodied with high carbonation and on the bitter side of IPA's.
Pretty good IPA, I would like it to be a little more balanced though to control the high bitterness. Overall I would recommend to try at least once. 709 characterstr4nc3d, Jan 26, 2010

S: Wow. Smell of floral and citrus hops just burst out of this beer. I detect a small amount of malt in the backend. 
T: Like a punch in the mouth at first then giving way to a nice sweetness - wait more bitter coming in at the finish. My palate actually numbs out for a second while the bitter just resonates on my tongue. Wow, this is a serious IPA. 
M: Creamier than any IPA I've had recently. Goes down very smooth. 
D: This is 9.5% ABV? I'm in trouble tonight with half a growler of this stuff. It looks like they overfilled so I probably have 3 12 oz beers left. Just really easy to drink and no alcohol detectable.
To say I love Three Floyds is probably an understatement. I haven't found a beer from them I didn't enjoy and this is certainly in my top 3 from FFF. 959 charactersbeerman207, Jan 23, 2010

Juicy hop flavor with lots of tropical fruit notes and clover honey lingering on the palate after you swallow. Strong floral and pine notes come out after a few sips. sticky, oily, medium body with lots of carbonation to break it up. The alcohol sticks around on the palate for a while in the aftertaste too. 434 characterspunkrkr27, Jan 20, 2010
4.05/5  rDev -7.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Pours a light copper color into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass with a full 1 finger of head. Delicate lacing as the beer slinks down the inside of the glass. First aromas are of ripe citrus and herbs. 
The first taste is rich. Alot of peach, grapefruit, and lemon rind are present.
The beer is very well carbonated and balanced. By 2nd sip, the alcohol starts to develop a very welcome warming feeling.
This beer finishes very clean with no lingering aftertaste. 465 charactersRocPorterFanatic, Jan 17, 2010
4.4/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Poured from a 22oz bomber into a pint glass. Color is copper, lets some light through but cannot see through it.
Taste is a sweet peach and bitter grapefruit, followed by a smooth and sweet caramel taste, finishing with a pine/grass hoppy taste. The taste is less floraly than some other IPAs I've had. 
In terms of rating, this seems like it would compare favorably against DFH 90-Minute, but I'll need to taste both side by side to determine my favorite.
This is an excellent beer and one I'd definitely drink again. 521 charactersghostee, Jan 15, 2010
4.12/5  rDev -6.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 422 oz. bomber poured into a Dogfish Head signature glass (January 12, 2010). No 'bottled on' date on the bottle or label.
Eyes: Pours a clean copper color with significant fluffy head to the top of the glass. Very thick lacing and a wad of foam floats atop the beer as I drink it down.
Nose: A very potent sweet mango-peach aroma, citrus grapefruits arise as the beer warms. One of the better bouquets I've come across. 
Tongue: A much more bitter pineyness that the aroma, a strong, sweet grapefruit taste dominates. Sharp and biting, the flavors smash the palate with bitter citrus, but the sturdy sweet malts prevent the bitterness from complete domination. 
Mouth: Sharp, bitter and biting, exactly what they were going for. The carbonation is well balanced and assists the depletion of the hop aftertase.
Libation: This is a hop bomb if there ever was one. Due to the tremendous flavors, the 9.5% ABV is not felt on the tongue, which is impressive. Very tasty and drinkable for such a big beer, but the alcohol and bitterness don't make this sessionable, one bomber is enough for me thanks. It certainly ranks among the top DIPAs in the world though, and I'll be back to try this again, most likely tasted against other quality DIPAs (DFH 90, Pliny, Hopslam, etc). 1,274 charactersOttoBomb, Jan 12, 2010
2.14/5  rDev -51.3%look: 2 | smell: 3 | taste: 2 | feel: 2 |  overall: 1.5Thanks to PabstBlue for this bottle.
Gusher upon opening, probably a bad bottle, looking forward to re-reviewing this one when I next get my hands on it. 
Opaque burnt orange color with a clumpy off-white head that dissipates quickly leaving a little lace on the glass. Nose is piney hops along with some citrus and yeast. There is a definite sweetness too...not good. Smells like molasses, carmel, brown sugar, and a touch of hot metal. Decent complexity, just not quite right. Taste confirms my suspicions that this might be a bad bottle, very sweet, the bitterness is soft, there is a pronounced astringency. Reminds me of burnt molasses with a bit of metal in the finish, like sucking on a sugary nickel. Too bad about this bottle, I've heard great things about this beer and have been thoroughly impressed with FFF other brews, so I'm sure the next one won't disappoint. 876 charactersknight84, Jan 12, 2010
4.27/5  rDev -2.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 422 ounce bomber sampled from a 12 ounce snifter.
Pours a nice, clear copper color with some good carbonation and a thin, but resilient head. 
Smells of wet grass, grapefruit, and thick, chewy hops. The smell on this one is perfect...sweet, slightly astringent on the nose...can't wait to give it a sip.
In the taste, the first thing that comes to mind is, again, wet grass. There is that sticky, earthy taste to it. That gives way to a bitter astringency as it slides across the tongue. There is that bitter bite of grapefruit in there, along with a bit of malty sweetness. The hops are the main show here...they are big, strong, and pungent...giving this beer that perfect hoppy blast. 
Overall, the beer isn't super balanced...meaning, it isn't one that is well-rounded on all ends...but, for what it is, the imperial hopping goes a long way...and creates a truly powerful hop experience. 894 charactersmovingtrain, Jan 11, 2010

Poured from a 22 oz bomber into my Duvel tulip - a very lovely amber gold. Minimal head and lacing but a very pretty beer in the glass.
Smell is outstanding with a dominant hop aroma.
Taste is clean and hoppy.
Mouthfeel is crisp and finishes well.
Drinkability is on the low side at this ABV but certainly makes you want more.
Exactly what an Imperial IPA ought to be - wish I could find more of this around here. 534 charactersOldYoda, Jan 09, 2010
3.98/5  rDev -9.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.5Many thanks to hayesez for the Christmas present!
Poured into a tulip, a clear copper-orange with golden highlights & a finger of head with clearly distinct bubbles, like a honeycomb. A city of tiny, fast-rising bubbles.
Big orange & peach smell in the aroma, with some hop zest. Surprisingly sweet. Grapefruit builds with some warmth.
Grapefruit, orange, peach, passion fruit up front in the taste, followed by an almost pastry-like sweetness & then medium-high, piney/grassy hop flavors. Definitely assertive, but not obliteratingly bitter. Sugars emerge in the aftertaste. Alcohol gains momentum.
Mouthfeel is full, with some acidity & a decent amount of carbonation. Ends with sweetness & sugar but isn't sticky. Very smooth.
This is a big boy, & while I tend not to be a fan of the sweet DIPAs, this one was pretty well-balanced: sweet without tasting like pancakes, hoppy without tasting like varnish. Just when you think one end of the spectrum is going to dominate, it reigns itself back in, balances, begins to teeter in the other direction, then balances, etc. etc. Very enjoyable, but one is definitely adequate. 1,128 charactersOneDropSoup, Jan 08, 2010

S - The smell is noticeable from afar as soon as I pour the glass. Delicious aroma of mango, papaya, oranges, and other tropical fruit. 
T - For as hoppy as this beer is, it's not extremely bitter, which is a good thing. It focuses more on hop flavor than hop bitterness as good IPAs should. There is still some bitterness in the finish, however.
M - Nice creaminess with good carbonation. Full bodied.
D - Drinks extremely well for 9.5%. Very delicious and very drinkable. 541 charactersfropones, Jan 08, 2010

M - Medium bodied with a very crisp and sharp feel.
D - This is terrific. Definitely one of my favorite DIPAs. If the alcohol wasn't so high and this beer wasn't so expensive I would drink another. 601 charactersCMW, Jan 06, 2010

A: Pours amber with a soft white head with very good retention, soft lace, but a little light for a DIPA.
S: Christmas tree and Simcoe/tropical fruit. Solidly aromatic.
T: Malty immediately, with a huge hint of pine power. Cedar and white grapefruit coming out in the finish. Nice long aftertaste as expected.
M: Smooth with its strength, ethanol is evident but well integrated and doesn't take over, full-bodied, an original big beer.
D: This is a very good ale, there's no denying it. Hoppy as hell, with a little East Coast flair. Not my favourite mind-blowing hop profile, but quite enjoyable. It's very expensive and you can get more for less. But I'm happy I tried this legendary beer again. 723 charactersHalcyondays, Jan 05, 2010
4.28/5  rDev -2.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Poured from a 22oz bottle into my Portsmouth snifter. Pours a clear copper color with a small white covering on top. laced nicely on the glass.
Aroma has citrus and pine with some sweetness and a little alcohol spiciness. Taste is hoppy as expected, citrus and pine are strong up front with a fairly strong bitter finish. There is also a decent amount of sweet malt present with some fruit flavors. 
Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is very good considering the high alcohol content. 
Overall this is an excellent DIPA. This is the second time I have had this and both were very good. The sweet citrus hoppy flavor reminds me a little of certain west coast versions such as Pliney and Sculpin. It also has a pretty strong malt backbone though which is pretty good. 801 charactersbillab914, Jan 02, 2010

A: Clean, sunburst and autumn leaves hues, moderate head with mild lacing that fades over a few minutes. 
S: Citrus fruits, piney, candy, nice sweetness from the hops, big hop presence (did I mention hops?), faint alcohol
T: A big hoppy brew, and balanced well for the style. I took about an hour and half to drink this, enjoying the pleasant warming sensation and lingering aftertaste. No astringency in the finish whatsoever. 
M: Awesome! Extremely smooth and creamy, especially given the ABV. Coats your mouth with a sweet sticky feel. Finishes great with a nice lingering aftertaste.
D: One of my favorite DIPA. Very drinkable, given the 10% ABV. One of the best. Highly recommended. 785 charactersHuhzubendah, Dec 31, 2009

A: Pours a hazy rusty gold color with a pumpkin hue and a one finger head of an off-white foam that dissipates into a haze creating some decent lacing.
S: Nice aroma of peach, mango, tropical fruit and a semi-sweet caramel malt. The hops are not as forward as I was expecting, but I can detect a slight pine bitterness.
T: Peach, mango, tropical fruit hit the palate first quickly followed by a semi-sweet caramel malt. A pine bitterness linger in the mouth and finish leaving less hop flavor than I envisioned. There is a slight vegetable flavor as well that seem to disapear as the beer warmed. I must say that this is a DIPA that I prefer a tad warmer than most others (I prefer most at about 45-50 degrees) as the flavors seem to breath and show there true colors. Very nice, but I wish there was a greater hop presence.
M: Medium to full-bodied with creamy light carbonation and no trace whatsoever of the 9.5% abv. There is a syrupy and slick character going on as well. 
D: Incredibly drinkable as the bitterness is kept at a minimum and the flavors are unique and intriguing. After finishing the bomber, I was not noticing any real effect from the 9.5% abv.
Overall this did not quite live up to the hype, but it certainy was nice and well-crafted. Perhaps this was not the freshest example, but I have hard time understanding do to its limited distribution that these aren't flying off shelves everywhere. I wish that all brewers would date stamp their beer so as to know how fresh a bottle is or not. With that being said, I really did enjoy this DIPA and I look forward to the other bottle I have in the fridge now and to having it again after that in the near future. Thanks again Ryan! Recommended. 1,928 charactersLunch, Dec 31, 2009

4.92/5  rDev +12.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Bottle courtesy of Discount Liquor in Milwaukee...
A: Pours a clear golden, with an unusual head of many-sized bubbles. Resiny lacing as it goes down the glass. Great retention. 
S: Reminds me of PtE (not sure if it is actually similar--or just similar in the intensity of hop aroma). Overripe pineapple melding perfectly with bitter grapefruit. Light floral note, and mild but noticeable malt scent in the background.
T: Bright, tongue-ripping bitterness. Sweet citrus lingers on the edges of the tongue, trying to fight back against the bitterness. Lemon, and a little orange zest. Very complex bitterness, much more so than Hopslam from what I recall. 
M: Nice and resiny. Medium body. Not "leafy/earthy" like some DIPA's can be.
D: 22oz...Really? Smoother than PtE, while seemingly just as intense (side-by-side research is needed in the future). 
The malt sweetness, while not "balanced" with the hops (in the traditional sense), keeps it from becoming unpleasantly bitter. Great "tilt" toward the hops while preventing them from becoming overwhelming (Something may DIPAs struggle with). 
The low carbonation, and the intense yet smooth flavours make this one of the world's best DIPAs. Hop heads--definitely seek this out. 1,236 charactersdarklordlager, Dec 28, 2009

T: Huge grapefruit citrus with lots of pine hops...more than in the nose. Big caramel malt mid-palate really balances out the hops. Very complex hop element, lots of citrus and pine and floral grassiness. This is a fantastic IPA.
M: Medium body with pretty aggressive carbonation but not too much. Very nice and smooth.
D: Very drinkable and the abv is never noticed, very smooth and delicious. Can see why this one is so highly rated. Excellent! 726 charactersRedBrewer83, Dec 26, 2009

Look- Dark orange, almost amber color. Somewhat foggy. Off white head that leaves a good amount of lacing around the glass.
Smell- Aroma is great. Strong citrus and hops with some floral and pine. I really enjoyed the smell of this beer. I smelled it for about 5 minutes as I waited for this beer to warm up a little.
Taste- Taste of grapefruit and sweetness...then come the hops after. Although its a double, not nearly as bitter as I imagined. 
Mouthfeel- Full body that is perectly carbonated. Great mouthfeel-very refreshing. Ends with dryness of hops on your tongue, but not super bitter.
Drinkability- Very well balanced. I drank the 22oz bottle with no problem. If it weren't so expensive, this would be a go to IIPA. 761 charactersboothbeer, Dec 24, 2009
4.12/5  rDev -6.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Made a good appearance, poured a hazy golden hued amber with a small, sticky pale tannish/white head. Had a big tasty hop aroma, a sweet piney and grapefruity, a faded tropical fruitiness and bare whiffs of alcohol. Moderate carbonation and a chewy, creamy medium bodied mouth feel, very good drinkability. Sweet piney at the start, then comes in a sour grapefruity, a gentle rolling hop bitterness in the palate, grainy and buttery malt flavors towards the end and a sweet, puckering piney bitter finish, the alcohol content only makes it's presence known in a slightly burning, lingering bitterness in the aftertaste, a delicious hopped up IPA. 646 charactersAnthony1, Dec 22, 2009
4.08/5  rDev -7.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Received in a trade with bulldogp04.
A- 22 oz. bomber decanted into a pint glass reveals a hazy amber/orange liquid. About a finger of white, frothy head sits atop it and provides excellent lacing throughout the session.
S- Citrusy hops, a bit of a tropical fruit smell along with caramel malts. A bit earthy as well.
T- Plenty of hops up front, mostly citrusy but also has the tropical taste that was alluded to in the aroma. Sweet malts actually play quite a role in this brew, the bottle may be a little old, but the hops still dominate.
M- Creamy smooth with little carbonation. A little heavier body than other DIPA's I've had.
D- Pretty good, the beer was a little sweeter than I had hoped, but the bomber went very quickly.
Overall, I'm pretty happy with this beer. A definite recommendation. 805 characterskbeals, Dec 20, 2009

Aromas of dusty caramel malts and muted fleshy fruits. I think this may be an older bottle considering the hops are not as pungent as I would expect from reading other reviews. It has a creamy mouthfeel with low carbonation. Flavors are sweet malts mixed with subdued hop resins. A bit of an alcohol warmth in the finish. There's a bit of earthy and woody flavors too. I would really like to try this fresh from the tap at the brew house. Maybe some day. 564 charactersblackearth, Dec 17, 2009
4.54/5  rDev +3.4%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 22oz Bomber into chalice, starting at 50 degrees
The beer appears opaque deep orange with white head. As the head diminishes it leaves some lacing but doesn't keep much retention.
The smell is wonderful: strong citrus, pine, and general hops dominate smell. caught enticing sniffs of this a couple feet away
The taste had more of that citrus and grapefruit, some pine, and lots of sweetness -- but nothing overpowering. 
The Dreadnaught is notable for lacking any hint alcohol, which is impressive for its ABV. First glass I definitely thought I could drink it all night (although at a premium cost), but the strong and complex flavors along with sweetness make it more difficult as you progress through the bottle. 
Definitely a beer I will be buying again in a couple weeks, one of my favorites in the style. 829 characterszachary80, Dec 15, 2009
4.55/5  rDev +3.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a slightly hazy golden orange caramel color topped by a healthy, eggshell white head that laces and retains beautifully.
The aroma is like a freshly halved tangerine. Nice and bright and citrusy. Malt and pineapple peak through as well.
The taste follows with hints of sweet tropical pineapple and apricot, with a sturdy malt backbone and candy sweetness all quickly washed away by a piney bitterness. The bitterness and hop flavors slowly fade with every sip and give way to a nice rounded caramel malt. 
The mouthfeel is the real star of the show, creamy, full bodied and chewy with a delicate carbonation level to balance it out and keep things light on the palate.
Really, the alcohol is there but it's well integrated and barely detectable except that you start to feel it all too quickly. Nicely warming.
This beer is virtually flawless. I appreciate a hoppy beer that has both hop flavor as well as hop bitterness, and, really, overall this is a case where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, where each aspect plays together nicely as a team and everything just gels and melds together wonderfully. 1,129 charactersMeisterBurger, Dec 15, 2009
4.27/5  rDev -2.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5"IT'S NOT NORMAL"
Poured from a bottle into a Stone IPA tulip glass. Jesus I can smell it already and it is several feet from my face. Beer is orangish / yellow carbonation moderate, hazy (like most DIPA) and forms a thin head of small to medium bubbles. Lacing is high.
Smells like a lot of malt, strong citrus hop aroma. This has an aggressive aroma. Really sweet smelling, no alcohol in the aroma though. 
Full bodied, hops are not the first thing that I taste. There is a nice sweetness and great hop flavors in the midpalate, the back end is not as bitter as I thought. Second taste, bitterness is growing but still not as strong as I expected / wanted. I wish there was a date on the bottle but alas, I cannot find one. Overall a decent and drinable DIPA. 764 charactersdrabmuh, Dec 11, 2009
4.74/5  rDev +8%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured into a pint glass.
Some pretty unwhelming head starts this off on the wrong note, but, to my pleasant surprise, it sticks around creating a nice froth on the top that leaves a long-lasting lace around the glass. However, the body is a little inconsistent. The orangish-yellow look moves from orange to yellow as you go further down and further out.
What does an IPA smell like? Hops and citrus. But I've never had one that's so well balanced. The citrus hits your nose and gives the auroma a nice pop that lingers while the bitter hops provide a nice and (unique, for me, to an IPA) subtle counterpoint to the sweet citrus.
So well refined that the only reason I give this a 4.5 is personal taste. I wish the citrus was a little more prevalent, but so good that you might as well disregard my point and try this beer. Still a very good balance between the bitter hops and the sweet citrus.
Maybe the one time I'm sure of the mouthfeel. I say that because it's so refreshing and complex. First off, it has the exact right amount of carbonation, which I find to be rare in beer. It isn't so strong that it's the first thing you notice, but it's enough to where it accents the refreshing citrus flavor very well. The feel is refresing and light but substantial, and then ends with a strong pungent fell in the back of your throat and a pleasant dryness in the mouth. Probably the only time I'll say the mouthfeel is the best part of a beer.
This is what an IPA should taste like, or at least what it should strive for. Well balanced, refined and bold flavors that aren't overbearing. Get this beer and love it. 1,619 charactersmmva321, Dec 10, 2009

4.52/5  rDev +3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Once again, huge thanks to MasterSki for this generous donation. 
Poured from a 22oz Bomber into an oversized wine glass (because I don't own a tulip!!!). 
EDIT* My original review was based on the first half of a 22oz bottle. Upon pouring the second half, I believe I underpoured the first. Appearance score edited as a result. The rest is unchanged.
A- Cloudy amber. It's that "liver punch urine" colour I love so much. (If your confused about this, go to a local boxing or MMA gym, spar for 10 rounds with a guy who loves to kick or punch to the body, then go piss). A good two fingers of gorgeous frothy white head forms that slowly recedes leaving a thick sticky lacing down the glass. This stuff is beautiful. 
S - I'm getting candied apricot from this. It feels almost weird, but unlike other IPA's, I'm not getting a blend of smells here. It's one clear smell, and it's freaking beautiful. I gave my wife (who HATES IPA's) a chance to smell it and she thought it smelled grand. Without suggesting it, she also said it smelled like candied apricot, so I think I'm on to something here.
T - Fruit loops. It tastes like freaking fruit loops. That is a level of awesome I believe words are incapable of doing justice to. I get to enjoy my guilty childhood pleasure in the form of beer. Okay, so maybe that's not exactly right. The candied apricot smell carries over strongly into the flavour. I'm picking up some grapefruit zest as well, but I think thats the bitterness coming in to play against the candied fruit flavour. OF course, it finishes with a perfect bitterness to reset the palate for the nest sip. This stuff is gorgeous. A little warming from the alcohol hits on the way down, but is very mild. The aftertaste though, is pure fruit loops. Seriously. Go eat a bowl of fruit loops and feel the aftertaste it leaves in your mouth. Then cleanse your palate and drink this. It's a dead ringer. Kellog's should invest in these guys. 
M - Minor carbonation, but once again, just enough to make it fun. It's got a nice slick feel and goes down easy. I'm leaving out the hooker joke on purpose. Make up your own. 
D - This whole 22oz'er is going down tonight, and I don't feel weighed down or bloated. That's good enough for me! 
Notes: If DFH 90 is about balancing contrasts, this is about integrating them into a singular vision. I absolutely adore it and will openly offer any Indiana BA's naked pictures of my wife (or myself, if that's your thing) to procure more of it. 
*I'm not really sending you naked pictures of my wife. Myself maybe. But you ship first. 2,583 charactersclockwerk, Dec 09, 2009
4.25/5  rDev -3.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Got this in trade from my BA buddy Kyle (Mystikyle71). Poured into a Great Lakes Christmas Ale series glass. Poured an amber color with thick pillowy two finger head. Nice sticky head but setteled a little fast. Smell is strong pine hops, some sweet malt, and grapefruit. Taste was everything I had expected. Very strong pine hops balanced by sweet malts, with nice hop bitterness continuing perfectly at the finish. Mouthfeel was thick like I love. Drinkability is very good. 476 charactersIntimidtor, Dec 08, 2009
4.39/5  rDev 0%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Big, pillowy white head on top of an amber, semi-cloudy liquid. Leaves gobs of lacing. Smells of citrus and pine hops with a decent dose of sweet, bready malt. A bit of a letdown as the malt seemed to overpower the hops. Taste picks up some of the citrus and breadiness but then turns pretty bitter (it lingers forever too!) and boozy. Smooth, full bodied mouth feel and low carbonation. One of these is plenty for me.
Overall, I was expecting a lot more from this beer given the hype and high scores. For some reason, I have not liked any FFF IPA's I've tried due to their excessive bitterness (and I love my hops). Gimme a Alpha Klaus Porter over this any day.
Edit on 11/20/15. Now that 3 Floyds has started to bottle date I picked up a 15 day old bottle and cracked it tonight. What a difference!! This beer is way better than my 3.42 score would suggest from 2009. Citrusy, dank, fresh, perfect amount of bitterness ... well done. 937 charactersbound4er, Dec 06, 2009
4.17/5  rDev -5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Had a bottle from Archer Liquors.
A - Deep amber/orange color with nice lacing.
S - Smell of citrus, tropical fruits(mango and papaya), some pine, and a little chocolate(weird).
T - Overly sweet maltiness, citrus, hint of pine, alcohol, ending slighty bitter.
M - Good carbonation just like all other in this category.
D - A very good drinkable IPA. Not as good as most Cali IPAs.
I would have to say that it is way too expensive for the quality and would probably be better fresh. 487 charactersSanDiegoBeerLove, Dec 05, 2009
4.17/5  rDev -5%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Pale golden, hazy, medium white head, moderately active, no lacing. SMELL grapefruity hops, fruity boozy esters, and sweet malt backing. has legs. TASTE smooth and balanced. Big sweet malty base with citrusy and other fruity flavors, some booze, and an assertive but not overwhelming bitterness. FEEL rich, thick viscosity, full bodied, drying bitter finish. OVERALL for hop heads, this one is an easy drinker. But this is definitely a big, bold, strong beer. 459 characterssprucetip, Nov 24, 2009

First of all I'll thank BUNKYPOP for sending me this all the way from Illinois! Pours a dark gold body, with some cloudy orange properties. Head is just off-white, short lived and medium sized. In the end the head just sorta sat around the edge of the glass. Aromas are a huge blast of hops, citrus (lemon and orange), sweet malty candies, and some grassy notes too. Complex! Taste is like a hops train coming straight for your mouth, and it explodes in your mouth. HUGE HOPS, bitterness, orange peel, candied malts, grainy and grassy, and a slight boozey warmth. Finish is boozey and warming, huge bite in the mouth. Long lasting hoppy aftertaste. Suprisingly smooth and enjoyable for the alcohol content. Awesome and prime example of the style. Well done Three Floyds! 834 charactersmrmanning, Nov 21, 2009
4.32/5  rDev -1.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Thanks to Hayesez for this bottle as an extra. 
A - Oranges and Yellows. Minimal head but great lacing with all that hoppiness.
S - Great smell with tons of citrus and grapefruit. 
T - With the winter coming up it was nice to get back to an incredibly hoppy beer. This taste reminds me of why I'm a hop head. I am not sure of the age but there was no hop skunk that you can get sometimes with shipped beers.
M/D - Very smooth. Nice sipper. Still doesn't beat a Maharaja for me but it's right there. 499 charactersKCHopHead, Nov 20, 2009
4.82/5  rDev +9.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Pours a beautiful hazy copper color topped with thin lacy white head. Tropical hop aromas are unique and are very strong. The flavor is sweet and also tropical. Flavors like sweet mangos and peaches flow well with the hop bitterness. The body is deliciously smooth and mildly carbonated to help move the flavors around the palate. Finishes very subtly and smooth into the sweet tropical bitterness. 398 charactersmanahansf, Nov 19, 2009
4.42/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5This is an IPA like no other. They serve this at 3F in a very small half-pint glass (you don't need more!) and the first thing I noticed was the amazing smell. Very floral with mango and orange. Thin white head with sudsy lacing. Great dark gold color. This beer must be experienced, the taste is phenomenal. Sure it has loads of hops like any IPA, but there is also a strong malt presence that can't be ignored. Sweet, spicy, almost caramely and a finish that just won't let go! This is a beer that epitomizes the "It's not normal" image of Three Floyds. 555 charactersthedrewski86, Nov 19, 2009
4.5/5  rDev +2.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Bottle bought in Madison while on a business trip. Poured into a plastic hotel cup.
Appearance: It looks thick. Not too much head, but very cloudy.
Smell: Not as in your face as some Imperial IPA's, but it could be this cup...
Taste + Mouthfeel: Well balanced for the style! Very hoppy of course, but some beers in this category have that malty backbone that overpowers. This one blends well. Citrus hoppiness dominates, malt and alcohol warmness are underneath. Very smooth with light carbonation.
Drinkability: After 22oz, the hops more than the alcohol are catching up to me. It's very enjoyable, but one is enough. 626 charactersdougofthefuture, Nov 17, 2009
4.97/5  rDev +13.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5treated myself with this one, has a really great look to it, surprisingly it has a small head, most IPA's have a nice lacy head, this doesn't have a very big head at all. the aroma is great, a hop explosion, but the hops are very floral and almost candy like, its really impressive. the taste is flawless, its incredibly smooth and well balanced, still has a great ipa bite, but it also has a character to it like few other IPA's i've ever had. its just a spetacular beer, mouthfeel is perfect. 494 characters1fastz28, Nov 14, 2009
3.8/5  rDev -13.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4A - Hazy orangish amber color with a nice head that dissipated leaving a small amount of lacing.
S - Lot of citrus hops, a little floral hops, slighty grainy smell and a touch of yeast, mild pine notes.
T - Kind of a confusing beer, I know it's supposed to be an IPA, and it smells like an IPA. It even tastes like an IPA with some bitter citrusy hoppy taste, but it also tastes like an ale. Lot of fruit and some grain and sour. It's good, but it almost seems like a hybrid beer as opposed to an IPA.
M - Thick, nicely carbonated. 
D - Pretty drinkable for something that comes across as heavy as it does. 
Bottom line is it's a very good beer but I find it an oddity, was expecting to be blown away by this top 100, but merely enjoyed. Would drink again, but not going to go crazy trying to find it. 806 charactersAgentZero, Nov 12, 2009
4.32/5  rDev -1.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4A: Pours a hazy amber color with a white head that fades to a small ring and leaves a lot of nice sticky lacing.
S: Smell is all hops at first and then I start to detect tropical fruits like pineapple. An excellent nose that is familiar to me...smells like a number of other DIPAs I really like.
T: Taste is all hops at first as well but the tropical fruits come out on the finish with a good amount of sweetness and then another blast of hop bitterness. Great stuff and the sweetness gets more pronounced as it warms.
M: Feel is oily and carbonated well. Coats the mouth and lets the hops really last on the finish.
D: I would drink this all the time if it were available in my local shop. Near 10% would make this hard to put down too many though.
Great DIPA and it really reminds me of my other favorites in the style. Also my first Three Floyds beer...keep up the good work! 883 charactersGregSVT, Nov 11, 2009

S: Lots, and lots of citrus hop character. Tough to pick out anything else, but nothing else is really needed.
A: Big rocky medium head that leaves major lacing and cover over a golden amber body.
T: Wow. this really is the hopheads dram that the bottle touts. Malt flavor is there, but peachy hop citrus is the star without question. The afterglow stays with you long after the sip.
M: Medium body with medium carbonation and a dry finish. Some tannin puckers the taste buds.
D: For a big IPA this has very good drinkability. Watch out, this could get dangerous!
O: My first Three Floyds brew was an amazing choice. By far the best IPA I have ever had. 713 charactersdpnelson1978, Nov 11, 2009

Smell: This beer has amazing fruit-like aromas from the hops. I dectect various notes of citrus and (mango?). I don't recall ever smelling mango in a beer.
Taste: This beer has pepper-like notes and packs a wallop of hop flavor. There is a lot going on with the flavor. In all, the falvors are well balanced and enjoyable.
Mouthfeel and Drinkability: The beer has lots of bubbles that dance across the tongue. Plus, this beer gladly goes down the hatch. 678 characterscudmud, Nov 08, 2009
4.16/5  rDev -5.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Poured from a bomber into a snifter:
Appearance and Smell:Poured a nice fairly hazy orange with a hint of amber. Quite a bit of carbonation present. Left a thin white head which stuck to the glass and wouldn't go away. Smelled of heavy floral hops with a bit of toast aroma and feint peach and pineapple. 
Taste and Mouthfeel:Taste of fairly hard hitting oily pine and grapefuit with a definite caramel malt present which hit along with the lingering earthy hops which seemed to keep it from finishing too dry. Really balanced medium bodied brew with quite a bit of character. A bit of carbonation presence helped keep it interesting throughout. There was feint warmth to this brew which helped keep me sipping slowly at it.
Drinkability:Very drinkable for a DIPA. I really enjoyed the balance of this, enjoyed it thoroughly. Plenty was going on in this. Would hesitate a bit to buy it again due to the steep price and the fact that it's not available in MN regularly. 971 charactersblackenmn, Nov 06, 2009
4.53/5  rDev +3.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Dreadnaught pours a nice shimmering amber with a slightly surprisingly small white head of very fine bubbles that recedes quickly to a sticky lacing.
The smell is not as aromatic as I thought it would be, but still very appealing. Grapefruit, peaches, maybe a hint of alcohol, pine, caramel sweetness. It seems like I can actually smell the bitterness that awaits.
The taste packs much more of a punch than the smell. Peaches, mangoes, grapefruit, caramel. The peach and mango flavors are particularly unique. The sweetness is nicely balanced with a good dose of bitterness. Finishes with more pine and caramel.
The mouthfeel is surprisingly thick (in a good way). Sticky with a slight gloop to it, but there's a enough carbonation to deliver the bitterness and spiciness from the hops.
This thickness effects the drinkability...but finishing the bottle by myself is not at all a problem.
Overall, I'm very impressed. The mouthfeel alone is worth seeking this beer out. I'm pretty excited now living just across the border from Indiana. 1,041 characterssjccmd, Oct 30, 2009

A- Clear dull orange with a bone white thin head. Very pretty lacing, not much retention.
S- Great fresh orange and lemon smell. Loads of citrus hop smells, mix with tons of pine hop character. Kinda smells like weed too. The malt also do some shining, I smell carmel and tobacco.
T- Such a lasting bitter taste. It's great, I just wish all those smells traslated into tastes. But there is nothing to complain about here. Mostly pine hop character but lots of grapefruit too. Slight hint of malt in there, but mostly its overpowered by hops.
M- A little light but it gets better as it warms. Not enough carbonation imo.
D- Pretty drinkable, but the abv is high and the hops are hard on the palate. Overall a wonderous beer that is highly recommended, probably my favorite IIPA. 805 charactersbrow1901, Oct 20, 2009

Appearance: A slightly rough pour reveals a cloudy, copper colored brew with about a half inch of thick, foamy head that has some decent retention. Plenty of soapy rings line the sides of my DFH glass.
Smell: Big burst of citrusy grapefruit and pine. A very subtle bit of malty sweetness brings in a little balance. Very nice.
Taste: Yea buddy. Bitter grapefruit stands out, with a bit of pine hanging out as well. There is a nice, smooth malty backbone that really does give this brew some nice balance. It still has some smack you in the face hops, though, which is what an IPA is all about.
Mouthfeel: Great carbonation, full body, and a viscous texture make this one a great drinker. This one is hard to put down.
Drinkability: A positively outstanding IPA, I can't put it any other way. Plenty of hoppy goodness, smooth and easy to drink. If I ever had a reason to visit the in-laws, this is it. 986 characterskrisandajt, Oct 18, 2009

4.4/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Received this bomber from iconoklaztor. Thanks Don!
Poured into a tulip glass. Pours a hazy orange amber color with a nice one finger white head. Has decent retention and leaves excellent lacing. I love the color of this.
I get citrus and piney hops in the nose. Earthy and floral hops come out with great intensity. There is also a significant malt backbone, and a woody character. Very nice nose.
The malt backbone comes out huge in the taste, one of the more malty IPA's I've had. It's not that it's not fresh, the malt just is naturally strong. There is also thick citrus and earthy hops in full force. Very complex and tasty.
Mouthfeel is medium and creamy. Nice carbonation level. Big bitter aftertaste combats the sweets malts.
Drinkability is through the roof. I don't get a whiff of alcohol in the nose, and there isn't any to speak of in the taste department either. Just a very easy drinking brew.
Overall, a solid DIPA. I can see why this one of the top rated DIPA's in the world, and I think it completely deserves it. 1,037 charactersMistofminn, Oct 14, 2009

The head fades leaving a thin veil of provocative lacing in the center of the glass with a couple of sporadic large bubbles and a thick ring of foam around the outer edge of glass... A glowing golden orange color... Very faint amounts of small slowed paced carbonation rise top without any sensible pattern... Some foam clings to the sides of the glass as the session progresses... 
S - Wonderful citrus aroma... Piney hops... Slightly medicinal... Wood... Just the slightest of malt undertones... The aroma slightly burns the back of the nose... Overall, a very complex and intriguing aroma... 
T - A full fledged hop assault that continues to intensify even though the aftertaste... The piney hops dominate... There are just the faintest hints of citrus and malt... Some peppery notes on the finish... 
M - Sharp biting carbonation on the tongue... Extremely dry and bitter... Slightly syrupy and sticky... 
D - Definitely a sipper... Aggressive and assertive are two words that immediately come mind when enjoying Dreadnaught... What odd is that this a an utter hop assault which isn't usually my cup of tea (beer), but I don't find this off putting... It's sophisticated and complex... You'll be feeling the hops from this one the morning after... 1,332 charactersphilbe311, Oct 11, 2009

THANKS goes to imperialking for the bottle. 
A- pours a radiant gold color with a lacy white head. nearly as nuce as a DIPA can look
S- pure piny bitterness on the nose not much citrus aroma floating around. pretty one dimensional. but still inticing
T- great taste in contrast to the color. super bitter bready taste. a hop BOMB for sure. I feel this fits right in with the american extreme IPA catergory. spot on. It's like a more complex Ruination. one of a kind brew with great influence
M- three floyds does not make thin unflavorful beer. this - beer is a mouthfull of delicious. probably one of the more viscous DIPA's i've had the pleasure of trying. great in my book, as a stout lover.
D- no problem drinking this substance. if there weren't any health and safety issues to consider. this would be an all day every day beverage. rivaling water. awesome brew. 938 charactersFreethyhops, Oct 09, 2009
4.23/5  rDev -3.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5This offering was poured into a Unibroue tulip. A nearly clear copper amber color with a beautiful creamy almost butter yellow head sitting atop it. Head craters as it fall creating a miniature mountainous landscape.
Aroma is quote piney and peppery but also stickily sweet smelling. Has a distinct malty aroma, moderately kilned crystal malts come big time at the end. Some vanilla or woody complexity and roundness seems to be present.
Big sweet flavors coat the tongue that include that vanilla wood flavor and dried fruits, figs, dark raisins, dried apricot. More citrusy flvors eek their way through as the bitterness cuts in. It is a big bold bitterness but also rounded and clean. It takes a little too long to settle in and doesn't quite have enough punch. Heavyweight but not instant KO unfotunately.
Medium full body, this avoids being too sweet like a number of sdpa styles. Nice small carbonation bubbles without being fizzy. Viscosity is spot on and the aftertaste retains a lot of bitterness, especially as the pint progresses and leaves the tongue pleading for more.
Barely makes it into the "I will drink this until I can't see if you let me" category of ipas. Not something I would choose for a long night out or midday beer, but certainly a worthy offering. 1,275 characterseallured, Oct 08, 2009

Great IPA experience. Nice big head with majestic lacing and huge grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple and hop aroma. Grapefruit, pineapple and big time tangerine mix in with the caramel and honey nicely. This is very complex for the style. Did i say hoppy? Big, big hops. The malt takes a backseat but adds so much to the overall flavor and character of the beer. Mouthfeel was close to perfect: silky, creamy, understated carbonation and a heaviness to it that makes it linger nicely in the finish. Alcohol is hidden extremely well making this tasty beer very easy to finish. 
Best Imperial IPA I've tasted yet, a personal favorite. 666 charactersnatelocc787, Oct 08, 2009
4.5/5  rDev +2.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a golden copper color with a slight haze. The stark white dense head stays around for a very long time and leaves an incredible amount of think lace and a thick coat.
The aroma is a wonderful mingling of pine and grapefruit hops, tangerine and caramel sweetness. 
The hop flavor of grapefruit, oranges, tangerine and pine all come roaring in with the first sip. This is followed a big sweetness of caramel and simple syrup. Middle to end brings a big bitter hit that lingers through to the finis and further. Subsequent sips bring more depth of grapefruit, pink, white and ruby red juice. The pine also emerges in the finish. Tropical fruit also begins to emerge as the beer warms up.
Medium body with vibrant carbonation. The bubbles carry the bitterness to the hard palate and the back of the mouth. The hop oils coat the mouth as well.
Overall, this is one fine beer. One of the best double IPAs I have had. 920 charactersjackorain, Oct 07, 2009
4.47/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5So today is my 2nd anniversary of being a BA member. And, it's my 100th review spectacular! I've been saving something great for it. I almost cracked my Westy 12, but decided to save it for an even better occasion, and when I can share it with someone. Got this great gem of a beer from either AgentZero or rjacklin in great trades. Poured this bottle of awesomeness into my oversized DFH snifter.
A: It loudly chugs its way out of the bottle into the glass and leaves a light but rich head on non-pour side, and big bubbles on the side I poured on. It slowly fades to look like a frost covered head that makes me want to lick it and have my tongue get stuck to it. It has a radiant golden orange red color that's pretty clear but leaves a very slight haze. Some extra sediment and haze pollutes the bottom of the bottle.
N: Nose is loaded with fresh piny and citrus hops, and I mean loaded. I think my nostrils just ripped apart full of hoppy goodness. I do get that slight musty aroma that I get from many of the extremely hoppy beers. A light sweet malt aroma makes its way piecing through the hops and adds a slight crystal caramel aroma that's pretty nice on its own. Some other noble hop goodness can be smelled, with slight grapefruit and citrus, but get light. The nose is pretty much dominated by the pine.
T: I sure hop the taste is similar... actually it starts pretty malty and sweet, very juicy and lots of caramel. I still get a load of piny hops and citrus. Man the taste is loaded with caramel and sweet caramelized brown sugar. I also get some juicy hops fruity hops in the center, with some tropical fruits and deliciousness. Some bread like qualities top off the maltiness as the hops start to take over again. Some spicey and floral hops also come through on the back end. It's like a golf course, and the front 9 is filled with some sweet caramels, brown sugars, and breaddy malts, and the back 9 kicks you in the balls with pine, citrus, juicy, spicey and floral hops. The piney hops also happen to be your golf cart so they carry you through the entire course. I don't really get much alcohol, very slight, which is great for being 9.5%.
M: Pretty rich and very sticky. It sticks all over my mouth, holding the pine and bitterness to it. Some spicey hops and light carbonation finish off the mouth.
F: Wooo, bitterness slams you on the finish. It dries off slightly but still has a slight sweetness. It's like my dessert IPA. The crazy pine and bitterness really catches up at the end. It almost makes your mouth smack itself... somehow, I didn't really think that one through. Anyways, the ridiculous hop and bitter finish really give you the feel that it dried off more than it did. It sticks around for a bit, then just waves goodbye and that's the end of it. It fades pretty well surprisingly for how bitter it is. I also detect some citrus and slight orange peel at the finish.
Final thoughts: A great IPA. It really is a dessert IPA that dominates your mouth. I really enjoy the malt quality and caramel with caramelized brown sugar. I think that is a quality of the IPA being a little older than it should be, but I'm really enjoying it. The crazy pine and citrus hops really hang around and mingle with the juicy fruity hop goodness. It must have a combination of a bunch of great hops. I probably should drink my other bottle soon, but it's soo good. I'll have to get a very fresh one and see if it changes at all, or if this one changed, or you know what I mean. It hides the alcohol very well too. Perhaps a little too sweet too. I can really enjoy a bunch of these, probably not all in a row, but eventually.

4.72/5  rDev +7.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5A- Pours nice light amber with average 1.5" head
S- Smells on the sweeter side for an IPA. Has the typical grapefruit scent along with a splash of pine. Pineapple and some other citrus are also present
T- Whoa. Definitely one of my favorite IPA's of all time. I'm used to all the west coast hop bombs, but this one is so balanced and delicious it blows most other IPA's away. The first thing I notice is the superb balance and the creaminess of the beer. Normally IPA's are very bitter and oily, but this beer has an almost stout-like creaminess to it that I'm really digging. Grapefruit, pineapple, and pine are present, but very well balanced by a very strong malt backbone. This one earns a 5 for taste. 
M- Incredible mouthfeel. Carbonation is perfect and it has a creaminess that makes this beer stellar. 
D- Alcohol is very well hidden and hardly detectable. Could drink this all night long and I would too if it was available where I live. 
Overall, this is the best IPA I have had to date. Dorado and summer yulesmith are excellent brews also, but they don't achieve a nice balance like this brew. Outstanding 1,117 charactersaewinte1, Sep 30, 2009

(A)- Pours a cloudy orange amber color that produced a good 1+ finger white head that has some great retention to it. Its leaving coats of sticky bits of lacing down the inside of the glass. 
(S)- Loads of pineapple and grapefruit citrus that has a twist of lemon. Has a sweetened background of honey and creamy wood. 
(T)- Very dry with creamy, yet bitter pine up front. The middle reveals citrus of lemon and pineapple with a nice sweet caramelized lime followed with a honey biscuit finish. 
(M)- Has a superb balance of bittering citrus pine with sweet honeyed malts. Great carbonation level. Has a mouthcoating feel to it that could just be due to its high abv which happens to be integrated very well. 
(D)- A superb DIPA that I was very impressed with. Has a great balance and is actually pretty complex despite its simplicity. Even though it has a high abv that is integrated well, this one really hit me hard nearing half way through the bottle. It might have been just a bad day for me, but I usually handle beer in volume pretty well; this one kicked me to the ground! 1,148 characterssweemzander, Sep 28, 2009

4.25/5  rDev -3.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Appearance:
Slightly hazy golden orange, about 8 SRM by my estimation. One and a half finger off-white head that dissipated very slowly, leaving behind excellent lacing.
Smell:
Not an exceptionally strong aroma for an IIPA, but adequate and dominated by pineapple scented hops. Very pleasant and inviting.
Taste:
Unadulterated hop juice. Starts with an intense sour citrus hop flavor and a hint of pine, briefly transitions into a tart sweetness which (literally) makes your mouth water, before leaving your tongue bruised with pure IBU's and the faintest breathy alcohol feeling. This is a treat and an experience, not an IPA for the uninitiated. I would rank this up there with Pliny the Elder in terms of pure concentrated hoppage. Delicious. 
Mouthfeel:
Just the right amount of carbonation to carry the aroma but not detract from the hop acidity. Smooth mouthfeel, not too thick or thin.
Drinkability:
One 22oz Bomber is plenty for a single session, although true hopheads wont be able to get enough. Deceptively smooth given the 9.5% ABV, but it's an IIPA so drinkability takes a back seat to complexity and tongue punishment. For what it is, the drinkability is just right. 1,184 charactersfishbrew, Sep 22, 2009

22 oz. bottle with a label that's actually quite disturbing. This label has a comical drawing of a British Red coat siting on a barrel of Ale in front of the Taj Mahal with a frosty mug of beer in one hand and a severed red hand in the other. On the red coat's red side is an Indian male with a sword in his mouth while holding a frosty mug of beer in one hand and sticking a gun in the belly of the red coat. On his left side is an Indian woman holding up a mug of beer. The more I looked at it, I thought it was a political cartoon about the imperialization of India was a bad thing. Below the picture is the 3 Floyds symbol of a skull wearing a gold crown made out of brewing utensils. Along the sides of the picture are some hard to read sayings in forest green lettering. To the far left of the label is most of the mandatory US information and to the right is a description of the beer and a tiny map to the brewery. Please don't waste your time looking for any kind of brewed date or year because it doesn't exist.
Appearance: A beer this big and this hyped up deserves a special glass, so I poured it into my Maudite Snifter. The first thing I noticed about the beer was this beer's extreme hazyness. It was so damn hazy that I couldn't even see the silhouette of my fingers on the other side of the glass. I know I've said this before in pervious reviews, but you gotta love the hazyness! For the color of the beer, it was a golden apricot in the center and a tangerine orange along the sides. Not much of a head of foam at first, but then like zombies raising from the grave, up rises this 1/2 an inch head of foam. The head of foam was bone white at first, but then I saw it transform into a faint peach color. I've never seen anything like that before. This multi colored head of foam had decent retention that left behind a tiny string of rings and a spot or two of lace. Good color, decent sized head of foam, and hazy as hell.
Smell: You don't have to stick your nose into the glass to get the full impact of citrus and hoppy aromas. You can clearly smell this beer from 5 feet away. I probably don't have to tell you how big the aroma was, but since I'm reviewing this beer, I will tell you. This aroma was strong with bitter citrus hops, a ton of bitter and tart grapefruit, lemons, a touch of mango, and all of these citrus aromas were sitting on a bed of pine needles. Swirling this beer around will only anger the citrus hops. I warn you that if you do that, the scent of citrus hops will shoot up your nose and you won't be able to smell anything else for a few hours. Any malts in the aroma? Yeah, that's a good one pal!
Taste: This beer was a tease. It will lead you like it did for me. The malts that weren't found in the aroma could easily be found right off the bat in the taste. These malts lasted for a little more than a second and then this beer kicks into high gear. After the malts, the taste goes hoppy and bitter and it never looks back after that. This strong hop punch consisted mostly of bitter citrus hops with more than enough bitter and tart grapefruit. If you think that's it for the taste, you would be wrong. Along with the hop punch was some tart lemons, a subtle pinch pineapple, a hint of mango, and then this hoppy taste finishes dry with pine needles. If you're drinking this beer, I sure hops you like the taste of hops because they will not settle for even one second. Prepare your taste buds for the onslaught of bitter citrus hops.
Mouthfeel: Full bodied? You bet your ass it was! Not only was it full bodied, but this beer had an everlasting strong aftertaste of bitter citrus hops, bitter and tart grapefruit, and pine. If you want to taste anything after this beer, make sure you have a glass of water nearby.
Drinkability: Is this beer over hopped? Yes! Is this beer over hyped? No! This Double IPA lives up to the hype and more. If you're a hop head, this beer is a must try. It's pricey, but well worth it. I knew there was a reason why I used this beer for my 800th review. 4,050 charactersAltBock, Sep 21, 2009

A - Pours a thick golden honey color. Nice thick foamy head. Slightly hazy.
S - Mmmmm. Smells like a delicious DIPA. Very hoppy. Nice piney notes with a sweet citrus backbone. Ripe clementines and mandarins.
T - Bitter hops come out really strong. Piney, grassy and slighty smokey. Good malt back bone gives way to dry bitter hops. The sweet citrus from the nose is not very pronounced. The alcohol is completely hidden.
M - Thick and syrupy.Moderate to high carbonation, with lots of nice tiny bubbles. Finishes very smooth and clean. Leaves the mouth refreshed and ready for more beer. Slightly dry, not not overwhelming.
D - Oh hell yeah. This is not quite in the same league as Pliny, but it is very good. I imagine this would have been better fresher, but beggers can't be choosers. I'd drink this all night. 836 charactersGenghis22, Sep 18, 2009

The 22 ounce bomber poured into the Leffe goblet glass that I recently got off a clearance rack at Whole Foods Market. This bottle of brew set me back $11. Label is a typical crazy looking FFF brew. 
Pours a brilliant orange colour with a very small but bubbly head that sits atop. Lots of lacing lines the glass and many bubbles originate from the bottom of the goblet. The nose is very appealing. Lots of citrus hops along with floral notes and the typical malts of a DIPA. Taste is spot on for me. This baby is loaded with alcohol but the flavor is everything but full of alcohol. Much like the nose there is a lot of sweet citrus comprised of oranges and lemons up front with a very enjoyable bitter finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and drinkability is high. This is one of the better DIPA I have sampled. Will definitely add this to my annual purchase even though it comes with such a high price tag. Credits to you FFF. 1,060 charactersabrand, Sep 16, 2009
4.37/5  rDev -0.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Thanks to iconoklaztor for the opportunity to try this beer. The reputation of this beer is hard to ignore. Pours a clear amber color with one inch of off-white head that had good retention before settling to a thin cap. Heavy spotty lacing is left on the glass. Slightly sweet aroma before a complex hop profile of citrus and tropical fruit takes over. The flavor is complex as well. Not up to Pliny levels but it is very good. The caramel malt gives just a touch of sweetness but the hops are fully on display with their citrus and fruit notes. I am wavering between 4 and 4.5 because of how hot this beer is. My preference is to have the alcohol a little bit tamer than what is demonstrated with Dreadnaught. The alcohol also hinders drinkability. Medium body with a soft carbonation gives the beer a nice soft texture. The alcohol cleanses the palate and adds warmth. 871 charactersmorimech, Sep 13, 2009

A - Clear deep golden-copper color with a nice white head and very good retention.
S - Citrusy and floral hops and sweet caramel malt. Really enticing.
T - Strong hops deliver a backhanded pimp-slap off the bat that hits you like a Mack Truck in the ass. Malty sweetness is right there with it to balance. Sweeter and maltier than something like Pliny the Elder, but sometimes that is a good thing. A little caramel is present as well as some honey, pine, and light citrus/tropical fruits.
M - Smooth with medium carbonation and hop oils coating your mouth.
D - Well, for what it is, it's really drinkable. I don't think they intend this beer to be chuggable, but for a double IPA, it really keeps you wanting another sip as long as that bomber or pint glass lasts. 937 charactersnickd717, Sep 08, 2009
4.52/5  rDev +3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 522oz. bomber served into a New Belgium globe glass. I don't know the freshness. Thanks, FernMaster's IL-resident roommate!
Pours an intense orange color, bordering on a saturated tawny shade. It is dense but not cloudy. A gentle pour yielded 1 1/2 fingers of pure, white foam. Lacing is wall-like around the glass.
The aromas are appropriately hard-hitting. Loads of lupulin make for a beer whose hop smells run the gamut from earthy to floral to tropical citrus fruits. Tangerine and pineapple play with rose petal, and there is just enough dirt/root to hold it all together. Some caramel malt opens up as the beer warms. I'd score it higher if not for the slight alcohol presence that distracted from the intensity of aroma.
Immediately I can tell that this bomber is past its peak and is in the declining stage. The intensity of flavor is not there in the maximum effect that one would desire. That isn't to say that this is disappointing, however. The hop flavors are still bright and aggressive but also well-rounded by time. The most noticeable, and pleasurable, flavor component are the citrus lupulin flavors. They hit the palate like a burst of juice. I enjoyed a similar perceived "juiciness" in Three Floyds Alpha King, but Dreadnaught takes it to another level. Mango, tangerine and occasionally pineapple flavors that taste like they were fresh-squeezed cover the whole mouth but quickly recede. An aggressively floral summer-garden thing dominates the finish; its like eating flowers in a salad if you've ever had that. There is a lot of malt sweetness, but it takes the background somehow. It never gets in the way of the real focus -- the hops. The finish isn't as bitter as I would like (again, this bottle is a bit past its prime), though the pine does open up with warmth. Everything is so well-crafted, though. The flavors are deep and in harmony with each other. 
The mouthfeel is pretty light considering the amount of malt that goes into an Imperial IPA. Its thickish in ways but not sticky; it goes down smoothly. Like fruit juice. Drinkability is kind of insane for an IIPA. The alcohol is masterfully hidden. And everything about the mouthfeel and flavor profile begs for constant drinking. This bomber is going to disappear in a flash. Perhaps the beer is harsher when fresh, but at this stage the rounded flavors make for the most drinkable IIPA I've ever had.
I'd love to have this beer super fresh. In the state that I enjoyed it in, however, it is still world-class in its style. Beautiful, bright flavors working with each other make for a wonderful drink. It is only lacking in intensity on the palate. A couple of weeks longer and my score may not be as high as it is today. The price is pretty steep, but I won't comment on that until I've paid full price for a super-fresh bottle. Either way, this is a treasure of a beer. Man, I wish that I had regular access to Three Floyds in MO. 2,924 charactersReaper16, Sep 05, 2009
4.35/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4A - A straight amber brown, with dark red and light yellow highlights depending on how the light is hitting. A white head that disappears quickly. Fairly clear through.
S - All citrus and pine and stickiness. All signs point to excellent taste.
T - Straight out of the fridge this was a little disappointing, as all I could taste were the bittering hops. However, having had this beer on tap a few weeks ago at the brewpub I knew it had more to offer. As it warmed it really began to showcase itself. The pine and grapefruit from the smell really take over and a somewhat sticky sweetness plants itself in the middle of the tongue and provides at least some balance. Still, this beer is all about showcasing hop complexity and it does better than most other beers, able to effectively juxtapose the fruity, citrusy character of hops with their potential for extreme bitterness. 
M - Well carbonated, and all of the flavors are quite powerful and tickle every area of the tongue, with particular excitement on the back sides where bitterness is picked up. Some slight alcohol burn is nice as well.
D - A delicious beer perfect for summer, but at 10 % it is dangerous and the 10 % is not hidden. I paid $10 for my bomber at the brewpub which I think is reasonable for a beer of this quality. 1,293 charactersschinebd, Sep 05, 2009

Smell: Fruit + hops, citrusy grapefruit+mango
Appearance: Hazy amber/gold, good head on its shoulders
Taste: Pretty phenomenal. Surprisingly sweet w/just a little bitterness. Don't taste the alcohol at all. Would guess it was about 6%. Aside from the fruitiness, just a little piny/citrusy hop bitterness in the finish and a good caramelly malt backbone but just the right amount.
Mouthfeel: Full and perfect for DIPA style
Overall: Very tasty. One of the sweeter of any IPA I've had. Similar to Maui Big Swell IPA but beefed up a bit. I like the fact that there is some malt, but not so much as to make it overpower the hops, such as Oskar Blues Gordon. Very delicious. Takes a completely different approach to hops than pliny the elder, but still works very well. Was shipped from Ohio by mail to me and was still damn drinkable by bottle. 881 charactersbret27, Sep 05, 2009

Smells just like I was hoping it would. Lots and lots of bright citrus, tropical hop aromas totally engulf my senses. Somewhere in the background you can vaguely detect a nice caramel, sweet malty backbone. Also picking up just a hint of hotness from the booze. It all blends together perfectly to make one hell of great smelling beer.
As good as this smells, it taste every bit as good. The first thing that hits the tongue is glorious glorious hops. Tropical fruit, orange, lemon, and a hints of mango temp my tastebuds with every sip. There's also a nice piney bitterness at the end. There's just enough malty sweetness to hold this thing together. But hey, this beer is ALL about the HOPS!!! Also some nice warming alcohol in there as well.
Nice creamy mouthfeel, that's not to heavy and the carbonation is spot on. This is a crazy drinkable and I'm not gonna have any problem finishing this 22. Another great beer from 3 Floyds. 1,110 charactersscifan, Sep 05, 2009

This was my first foray into the world of DIPA, and it was an eye opener. 
The beer was presented in a half-pint glass. The appearance was a deep copper brew with a good finger's worth of sticky off-white head. It left streaks of lace throughout the entire serving. 
The aroma of the brew hit me square in the face about 1/8 of a second after the glass was served. Wow, talk about aroma. I actually placed the glass across the table, and you could still get some of the aroma. The hops are definately the star of this show. Some caramel notes were present, but they were dragged back down by hoppy tendrils. There was a definate citrusy and tropical aroma going on, resiny and bracing. 
The hops shine through in the taste. They are the showpiece, with the malts taking a supporting role. There was a good balance between the two, but again, this was the hops time to shine. The initial bitterness almost caught me off guard. It was definatly a wake up. Hell, I thought I may had chipped a tooth. The hops had a wonderful grapefruit, pine resin, tropical menagerie going on. 
The feel of the beer was a lot thicker than I expected, almost bordering on syrupy. There was a pronounced touch of alchol burn, but the pain went away soon enough. 
All in all, my first experience with DIPA went over well. I can see myself indulging in the style whenever the opportunity presents itself. I'm glad Dreadnaught was the beer to open this door. 1,497 charactersKrisPaulk77, Sep 04, 2009

Aromas abound. Plenty of sweet citrus or tropical fruit (pineapple, oranges, mango) along with some caramel. Smells a bit boozy as well, perhaps a little like rum. The British navy would be proud.
This is some potent stuff. One sip and it warms my throat thoroughly and numbs my tongue nicely. Lots of piney, resiny flavors along with a good deal of sweet malt backing up all those hops. There is some very sweet fruit flavors that come out, more of the pineapple and mango. Definitely a well done Imperial IPA.
Dreadnaught lives up to the hype, its intense, its big and its flavorful. I can imagine that a bottle of this right of the line would have even more fresh hop flavor and aroma. 
Great stuff from the Floyds of Munster, Indiana. 936 charactersindiapaleale, Sep 03, 2009

A - Slightly hazy deep amber/orange body with one-finger creamy off-white head that settled to a patchy film but yielded intricate sticky lace all around the rim of the glass. 
S - Beautiful hop bouquet with citrus and sappy pine at the forefront. Extremely fresh, pungent hop nose. It's almost as if I was inhaling fresh hop cones that were plucked from the vine and crushed in my hands. Some sweet caramel malt pushes through, but the aroma is all about hop goodness.
T - Like the aroma, the hops really come to life with a smack of pine sap and juicy, tangy grapefruit and citrus fruit. Caramelized sugary malt sweetness and toffee notes attempt to quell the hop bitterness a bit. This is a wonderfully balanced DIPA that produced some exquisite hop burps.
M - Solid medium body with a syrupy texture and spot-on carbonation for the style, which provided adequate bristle on the tongue. 
D - For the record, I stand by my decision that this is the finest DIPA produced in the United States... much to the chagrin of my beer cohorts. F 'em! ;-) 1,076 charactersffejherb, Sep 01, 2009

It pours a deep copper off colored brown with a 1 inch head. Great looking beer, it has plenty of lacing as well. Big, thick, frothy lacing. The head dissipates into a swirl of small bubbles with a centimeter rim of big bubbled foam around the edges of the glass. 
Smells like a ton of citrusy hops. Grapefruits, lemons, mangos. The beer definitely jumps out of the glass at you but doesn't have as much aroma as some other IPAs. Could be a less than fresh bottle but I assure you it does not take away from the smell. It's still a great smelling beer.
Your first sip is almost an overpowering bittering, fruity blend of hops. The piney ones aren't too present but they are still there. They fruity hops definitely draw you in to drink more and the malts smooth everything out to easy that brew down your throat. The taste is exceptional. That is the easiest way to describe it. 
The mouthfeel is up to par with everything else. Some bubbles but not many. The thickness is just right.
Drinkability is good due to the flavor but the ABV is rather high which definitely gets you to slow down about half way through the bottle. Of course, this is a characteristic of the style but the high ABV takes away from the drinkability. 
Overall, I'd say this is definitely in the top 5 DIPAs I've ever had and I'm grateful this is available year round. Whenever I visit my parents in Louisville, I always make sure to make a jump over the Ohio and pick up atleast 2 bombers of this beer. It's excellent. 1,539 charactersauroracrisis, Aug 29, 2009

4.6/5  rDev +4.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Huge thanks to brentk56 for the trade! This is one I've been looking forward to.
Bomber served chilled in a chalice. As soon as the cap is popped, the aroma hits me and it's fantastic. Pours a hazy golden orange color with big towering sticky head. As it slowly settles, lacing is left behind.
Aroma is a heavenly blend of tropical and citrus fruits. Mango, pineapple, and grapefruit all come together here.
Flavor is exceptional and is most notably impressive for it's balance. All things are relative, of course, because this is a huge and very generously hopped DIPA. Sweetness up front gives way to strong but controlled hop bitterness. Lots more of the tropical fruit experienced in the aroma which is all really nice. The malts provide a bit of carmel sweetness and keep the hops in check (somewhat) but this is obviously a showcase of the latter. 
Mouthfeel is thick and chewy with big sticky resinous hops. Carmel flavors may enhance these characteristics, at least in one's mind. Drinkability is good for the style but it's still very strong and hoppy. Alcohol is well-hidden.
Overall a fantastic example of the style. In a market that sometimes seems saturated in such over-hyped and over-hopped beers, this one is truly very well done. 1,251 charactersGilGarp, Aug 23, 2009
4.65/5  rDev +5.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5This bottle is a keeper; I don't mean because of the superb taste, but because the artwork is pretty badass as well. I had this from a bottle poured into a Gulden Draak tulip. My roommate and I were already in awe of the beer as it poured, a very light gold mixed with amber that just looked like a beer should. The smell was also something that even my other roommate who is not a fan of IPA's, wanted a taste after smelling. The hops and wheat are noticeable to the nose as well as the present mango and citrus added to the beer. The mango and citrus cut into the hops, preventing it from being to hoppy, but creating a perfect balance in the process. The citrus and hops combine so well that I almost couldn't stop from continually lifting my glass until the bomber was gone. Sometimes IPA's can be difficult to drink because of the presence of hops, to some, but in this beer such a great balance was created that even my roommate who dislikes IPA's enjoyed the taste. It's easily drinkable and delicious. 
Dreadnaught is everything you want in a double IPA. If you like IPA's, it would be foolish to pass this beer up. After tasting it, it becomes readily apparent why Dreadnaught is in the top 100 list. 1,210 charactersFernMaster, Aug 22, 2009
4.59/5  rDev +4.6%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Fresh Bottle bought at the brewery 2 weeks ago at DLD. Poured a dark orange color with a thin white head. Smells like I'm walking in a hop field. I think they should patent this for hop perfume. I'm not sure about mangos and peaches, but I smell hop fields, pine, and some slight sweetness. Has a medium mouthfeel. Tastes like I'm chewing on a sweet resin candy bar. Has a sweet punch in the face pine, gregarious sweet caramel, and spank the monkey finish making me want more. Overall this is a great brew fresh. 513 charactersfiver29, Aug 21, 2009

After have one and then going back from another and another, this beer just hit the mark.
I know they really move to lots of innovative beers in a short period of time, but it would be nice if would stick around for awhile.
Alas I cannot find this beer widely outside of the area and even lobbied hard with a distributor to add it to Nashville. 418 charactersafter5, Aug 20, 2009
4.53/5  rDev +3.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured from bomber to 22 oz snifter.
Appearance - Hazy golden amber with a nice murky content to it. Poured with a 1 finger bubbly head that laces nicely.
Smell - Tons of sweet grapefruit and orange followed by some resiny pine and candy smells. At the end you can catch a bit of the alcohol and malts.
Taste - Wow this one doesn't really taste like it smells at all, I catch the grapefruit and citrus up front, then catch a bit of the sweet caramel malts, but what makes this beer amazing is the bitter finish, chased with a bit of coffee almost. From the smell I expected very sweet. The taste it leaves in your mouth is astounding. This beer is superb.
Mouthfeel - Very nice mouthfeel, for its stature it is fairly thin, but not in a bad way. Nice bitterness and a good amount carbonation. Very oily and resinous on the tongue.
Drinkability - Incredible for its abv, if I could get this everyday I probably would, until the wallet wouldn't allow me too. I can see drinking this in any weather and season. Tonight seemed like a great time also, and it was.
Great, great beer. 1,083 characterscvaypai, Aug 20, 2009

A: Deep amber color, hazy, thin off-white head.

T: A burst of grapefruit and orange initially, followed by a caramel sweetness and a bit of alcohol on the finish. Bitter, but not overly so.
M: Very smooth, great body, and perfect level of carbonation.
D: Despite the high ABV and the slight alcohol bite, this one has such great flavors that you could drink it all day. 553 characterswomencantsail, Aug 20, 2009

A - trans copper, decent off white head w/ nice lacing
S - lots of fruit in the nose, endless amounts of citrus/pine hopage. honey and mango play a huge role and the caramel malt backround becomes more appearant as the beer warms a bit.
T - near perfection to the taste buds! with so much hop bitterness this beast of a beer still manages to balance w/ fruit like sweetness and a solid malt backround without ever getting to bready. slight spice in the finish.
this beer successfuly achieves complexity while still satisfying hop heads.
MF - sharp carbonation but smooth and oily feel to the full body.
D - for 9.5 percent, this one goes down so easy it's dangerous. had 22 oz. and i wish i had more, excellent. i have yet to be let down by FFF.

4.64/5  rDev +5.7%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a nicely decorated 22 ounce bomber. Has a 2 finger thick dense off white head that quickly recedes and leaves behind a nice lacing. Color is of dark copper/orange.
Smell is intense, when I first popped the cap off this one it was a tropical fruit surprise. In the glass it is very hoppy and sweet smelling. Has a decidedly citrus hop scent, not too spicy. There is a hint of pine needles. Hop mania through and through.
Mmmm a refreshing hop bomb. The hops attack your palate furiously and do not relent. Citrus hops come in a barrage, then a slight bit of sweet biscuity malt hits, finishing with joyful hop bitterness. Yep, the malt is there, in the middle, but this is a hop lover's dream. Mouthfeel is smooth and perfectly carbonated.
There is no problem in finishing this 22 ouncer, could have gone for a 750 of this or heck even a liter, the alcohol is definitely noticeable and a bit warming but doesn't really show it self too much too be off-putting enough for one not to easily down one of these quickly.
An excellent DIPA. 1,049 characterscrossovert, Aug 17, 2009

S: I am thinking that this bottle has a little age on it, because while smelling hoppy (mostly orange/tangerine), it didn't have the juicy, bursting hop aroma that I was expecting. There was a substantial amount of malt in the aroma.
T: Great amount of bitterness up front followed closely by malty sweetness. 
M: Full-bodied. Great.
D: The alcohol is hidden relatively well. This beer can hold its own against any DIPA. 475 charactersgameface23, Aug 17, 2009
4.5/5  rDev +2.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5On tap @ the FFF Brewpub on 8/7/09. This was a 10 oz or so pour in a 1/2 pint glass. 
Pours a beautiful clear amber, with a 1/2 finger of brite-white looking head. Retains with just the softest and creamiest look to it, that just DRENCHES the sides of the glass with super rich lacing. Such a delicate look for a such a monsterous beer. The aroma is hugely floral and piney, and just drips with lush tropical fruit notes of grapefruit, mango, and apricot. Caramel and bready malts give this a tangy edge in the nose, but man, this bouquet is all about the HOPS! Just exquisite. 
The taste is quite resinous, with a sticky bitterness that hangs in the mouth, before giving way to a steady and long lingering spiciness. The hop profile is very aggressive but is still so very well balanced by toasted toffee and that same fantastic blast of tropical citrus. Finishes spicy, with a lingering warmth to it. The mouthfeel is medium-fuller bodied, with a more bubbly carbonation on top, and then a very oily feeling slickness underneath that keeps this moving nicely. There is some rich warmth to the body but this is drinking VERY nicely for the size of the ABV that is involved here. 
This is just a classic from FFF that never gets old, no matter how many times I've had it. Huge, yet well balanced flavors, and a super slick body keep this hop-monster very drinkable. This was such a treat to enjoy on tap at the brewery. 1,422 charactersKegatron, Aug 12, 2009

TEMP: Cellared at approx 45 degrees
Thanks to tburkhart for this one!
This one pours a mildly dark, golden amber color. About three-fingers of frothy, white foam make the head. This recedes to a nice covering that sits atop the golden amber liquid. The lacing is very good and very sticky.
A nice, big, hop presence in the nose. Big citrus smells, heavy on pineapple, mango, peach and grapefruit. Nice floral and pine notes. This is all balanced out by a wonderful presence of caramel malts. Notes of golden brown sugar. A nice breadiness.
This is a fairly well-balanced IIPA. I expected the hops to be more dominant from the nose. They are definitely here and bring with them all of their bitter glory. They are mingling with a nice, strong, maltiness though. Big citrus notes and piney bitterness mix with some brown sugar notes and mild caramel sweetness.
I'm not a hophead but I'm learning to love IIPA/DIPA's and this one would certainly be in my top 10 for the style.
Nicely full bodied, with a slight touch of thickness. Good medium level of carbonation, which is almost perfect. Very smooth with a nice, light touch of creaminess that keeps it interesting.
At 9.50%abv, I'd imagine that it would be hard to drink alot of this and remain standing. As the alcohol is very well hidden within the flavor though, I find it very easy to drink, in general.
I'd like to have more, please. 1,408 characterscoldmeat23, Aug 12, 2009
4.12/5  rDev -6.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4This poured a hazy light copper with some off-white head. It smelled like mango and apricot hops, with sweet caramel and honey malt. It tasted like mango and apricot and copper hops, with lots of caramel and some roasted barley malt. It was somewhat thick with a bit of carbonation, and had a bitter aftertaste. Overall this was a very tasty beer that was clean and balanced. However, the hops seemed a bit faded, which was very disappointing. I enjoyed the malt flavor, but I was hoping for stronger and juicier hops. It still had great body, and it hid the alcohol well, so it was very easy to drink. A generally great beer, but it still didn't live up to the hype. There are definitely better 2IPAs out there. 712 charactersPencible, Aug 11, 2009

Pours 1 and 1/2 fingers of creamy beige head. Great retention with amazing lace wall.s Color is a hazy pale orange sunset.
Aroma: Huge floral hop aroma, caramel malts, with an intense amount of grapefruit, mango, and sweet peaches.
Taste: Very sweet taste. Mango, peaches, and grapefruit citrus are up front with a floral taste. In the end comes a rush of caramel malts. It is pretty sweet for a IIPA.
Mouthfeel: Big hop bite, very bitter. Medium bodied and well carbonated. Ends with a big floral aftertaste, only slightly dry which is nice considering it as an iipa.
Overall, this is a really well developed iipa. I will only have 1 pour of this, but it is a great beer. I'd easily get more of this. 738 charactersmothman, Aug 11, 2009

A moderate head resides on top of my pint glass. A thick coating of lace covers my glass.. The aroma is like an ocean of hops. So piney and sour smelling. It's an amazing boquet of sour fruit and hop cones. The flavor is huge. A blast of pine and sour then malt smoothness with a touch of alcohol on the finish. This seems like a perfect balance of hop bomb and smooth malt. The medium body with plenty of carbonation to round it out. The high abv is there but fits nicely and makes me feel warm and fuzzy. This is my first IIPA and I must say I'm really starting to enjoy becoming a hop head. 700 charactersbeerwolf77, Aug 04, 2009

Pours a bright tangerine-amber color with a relatively thin head with some nice sticky lacing. Aromas are of fresh, sweet pineapple, grapefruit, and orange with a great floral bouquet of hops with a hint of honey. Tastes are bitter up-front, but also sweet with a malty presence. Grapefruit and orange rind with some citric hops and a pleasant piny finish. Some hints of caramel from the malts, but remains bitter on the finish. Mouth-feel is medium bodied with some hop oils that cover the palate nicely. Alcohol is very well concealed. Excellent offering from 3F and I am very satisfied with finally getting a chance to re-try this great IIPA. Solid representation for the style. 802 charactersbarnzy78, Aug 03, 2009
4.72/5  rDev +7.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Pours as a hazy copper with the haze settling halfway through. A two finger, off-white head. Aroma is an awesome hops/citrus bomb. Flavor? Wow, I'm surprised, not the overwhelming hop bitterness that the aroma led me to expect. Nice malty sweetness to balance the hops. Grapefruit and something sweet that I can't put my finger on. Feel is a little heavy/oily, pretty thick for this type of beer. Drinkability? I want more, but because of the ABV, I'll have to stick with the bomber I just finished. I have to admit that I've never been a big fan of IPA's, but damn, I've had some great ones in the last two months and I'm becoming a fan. 638 characterskegger22, Aug 02, 2009

taste is much the same - this beer reminds me of sculpin or hop stoopid which has a high tropical fruit hop flovor and a good balance of malt backbone
mouthfeel is good with just enough of carbonation to make this medium to light beer go down smooth

Appearance is lightly hazed amber notes with a tiny bubbly off-white head that leaves decent lacing. Aromas are of strong toasted caramel and bready malt. Hop aromas are grapefruit to boot. Flavors are similar, with the hop profile coming on strong, but there is definitely balance in this DIPA. Raisin are playing a big role here, too. Bitterness is high here! Medium syrupy mouthfeel with low to medium carbonation. I can sip on this beer all afternoon! I feel like I've said that about FFF beers before... 631 characterswashburnkid, Aug 01, 2009

Big thanks to "beveritt" for procuring this out of state gem for me.
A- Very hazy amber/orange. Pours with 1+ fingers of off white head, which to a sparse, thin, oily cap. Leaves ample lacing as consumed.
S- Grapefruit and pine resin hopiness. Quite sweet, malty notes eek their way in through the avalanche of hop.
T- Very assertive pine/citrus hop bitterness on the first sip. Rush of caramel malt notes follow to provide balance. Bitterness level is high. Alcohol content is well blended.
M- Moderate carbonation. Full feel, creamy, and goes down easy. Fair amount of residual hop oiliness. Exceptional.
D- Good. 9.5% ABV, probably would want to restrict myself to a single bomber of this stuff.
Future outlook: Really good, ....close enough to get without an extreme amount of effort, but not distributed here....so don't know if I'll have it again anytime soon. 944 charactersDoctorDog, Aug 01, 2009

Pours a darker gold orange color with one finger head that quickly reduces to a ring around the side of the glass. Very subtle lacing.
Big sweet citrus hops with sweet ripe pineapple. Some sweet roasted malt, maybe a bit of mango. Very sweet and juicy smelling.
Nice juicy hops not biting or tiring in any way. Tastes like there is pineapple juice mixed in. Some pine from the hops, nice malt presence to keep some balance.
Silky smooth mouthfeel, medium bodied. Carbonation is soft and velvety smooth.
Quite drinkable at this ABV. Alcohol is tasted a bit, but felt a little more. Very clean finish. A well done DIPA. In my top 10, possibly top 5 for DIPA's. That said, still not worth the high price point (see Hop Stoopid or BR Racer 5). 807 charactersjera1350, Jul 29, 2009

Pours a hazy orange/yellow hue (not cloudy), with a nice fluffy head. The head looks like dish soap with small oily bubbles. Nice carbonation too.
Smells of fresh tropical fruit and citrus. Light floral smell. Just a hint of alcohol. 
I can taste mongo, pineapple, and tons of fresh hops. Not bitter at all. Theres some malt in there but not much. If there was a liquid tropical starbusrt candy, this is what it would taste like. 
The mouthfeel is slightly oily, and full bodied. Crisp lipsmacking finish.
This is a great imperial ipa. Wasn't tough to finish the bomber by myself. The alcohol was a little more evident than I would have liked it to be, but definitely not a distraction. I will definitely pick this up if I come across it! 791 charactersdavey, Jul 29, 2009

It pours a mostly clear copper color, with a couple of chunky bits of sediment. Not much head to speak of, but a really pretty body.
The smell is a citrus bomb -- orange, lemon, nectarine. Taste is more on the pit fruit side. I can pick up some apricot and peach going on here. Very cool. A ton of malty backbone to balance the taste out. Thick and resinous swallow. This is a really nice double IPA. Thanks! 498 charactersDaveFL1976, Jul 29, 2009

A- Dread had a pale/straw yellow color with golden spots. When the glass was full, there was no bubbles on top, then some white foam appeared making a skim with warming, it never left. A ring of lace around the glass. Small patterns of lace. 
S- Big citrus, mango, pineapple, peaches, oranges, fresh as can be. And of course a nice sweet malt backing that comes up with warming. The best of both worlds.
T- Yes, this delivers. Getting a basket of tropical fruits like the ones above. Grapefruit and oranges are dominate. Caramel malt after the initial blast, but very well balanced. Some forrest pine also giving a distinct bitterness, very nice.
M- Hoppy, bitter, tasty and sweet all at the same time, dread has somewhat of a oily feel from a medium feel. This one is nicely carbed. Became more bitter as time passed. 
D- It took me sometime to get through it, bit dread never lost it's pizazz, this is well put together. Very easy to sip on or indulge more quickly, I was somewhere in between. The 9.5 is high and rightfully so with this much flavor & the bitterness is is just right, not a burn out. I really enjoyed this. 1,170 charactersBARFLYB, Jul 29, 2009

It smells wonderful, hints of citrus, hops and a surprising peach comes through. 
After the great start, the taste wasn't exactly what I was expecting. It was very fruity so I was expecting to taste a little of that, instead I really just tasted coriander and hops. I think overall its very good for an IPA, but I was slightly put off because it didn't taste like I thought it should have. 517 charactersjrallen34, Jul 27, 2009

4.62/5  rDev +5.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This is my first encounter with a Three Floyds beer and it's pretty great. It's a big, sweet, citrusy/floral DIPA with good hop resin bite. The beer pours a deep gold with little head but lots of lacing. The smell is thick with clementines, limes and floral hops. The flavor is similarly great. The hop flavor is very strong nearly to the point of having a solvent character. The malt is still quite sweet adding an excellent caramel character. The hops taste strongly of oranges, sweet and citric. The defining characteristic with DIPAs for me is the bitterness level and Dreadnaught is within the optimum range for me. The mouthfeel is oily and thick without being cloying. The drinkability is very high despite the fairly high alcohol level. 744 characterspopery, Jul 27, 2009
4.44/5  rDev +1.1%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 3This is a great DIPA. Competes with the best. 
 Fruity, pungent hops on the nose. Smell is excellent, full, rich citrus and piney goodness. Tropical smells there too. 
Fruity, citrus dominated hops on the taste buds, Pine and tropical flavors mix in as well. Everything proportioned right, jumping all over the place just like it should on the tongue.
 Malts balance things just perfectly without unseating King Hop, who is clearly in charge. Just so well done, so intense, every flavor just where it should be. 
Full mouthfeel, perfect compliment to the flavor, lingers on the tongue, just enough. Next sip hard to delay. 
But...it's terribly overpriced. Equivalent of 26 bucks for a 4 pack, or 40 for a sixer. This isn't a fancy barrel aged limited release, special ingredient deal. There are several other high ABV IPAs almost as good that completely destroy Dreadnaught on price. 
And start dating your bottles. 920 characterscaskstrength, Jul 27, 2009

I wasn't quite sure what to expect. I had only heard the hype, and that it was loosely compared to Hop Slam. 
Poured a wonderful orangey-gold color. Nice thick head with great lacing. 
The aromas from the hops come through nicely. There's also a sweetness that I can't identify. Maybe my palate isn't trained enough. 
Tastes WONDERFUL. Lives up to the hype. I understand the loose comparison to Hop Slam. It's very hoppy, yet has a nice honey-ish sweetness to it. The Hop Slam was good, but not something I'd look for necessarily. The Dreadnaught was balanced well enough that I'll make the 45 minute drive to Indiana to buy it again. Hoppy, smooth, sweet, nice body, and all at once. 
It's definitely not a thin beer, but not heavy, either. In fact, I wanted to swirl my individual pint glasses once I got it half empty to mix the yeast and such back in. Nice pronounced lacing with a decently thick head. 
I not only could drink several of these, but my wife (who will taste all of my beers, but not drink any of them) asked about getting some more so she could have some for herself. Normally, she's a Woodchuck drinker, with an occasional Shiner Bock (she grew up in TX). 
This beer surprised me with the sweetness, but I will definitely drive the 45 minutes to Indiana to buy it again. 1,404 charactersHisDorian, Jul 26, 2009

A - Honey in color with a thin head that leaves some nice lacing. Mostly clear, particularly as it warms.
S - Strong citrus notes, orange and grapefruit. Some pineapple notes. Strong piney finish with a well balanced hop presence.
M - Thick, creamy, syrupy and unbelievably smooth. Subtle carbonation that is just about perfect.
T - Alot like the nose, citrusy and piney with a well balanced maltiness that lingers in the throat. Alcohol is well hidden and even as it warms, it stays that way. Some bitterness but that's to be expected with this style and it's perfect.
D - I had no problem finishing the bomber, but it did leave me with a considerable buzz. Of course, this isn't a session beer and I'm not quite sure how to rate it's drinkability given the style, but I suppose I'll base it off the ease of finishing the bomber. 881 charactersjdflyer06, Jul 25, 2009
4.4/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4What a looker. I can almost taste this one just looking at it. The color is a glowing orange with a little bit of haze. It looks like freshly squeezed fruit juice of some kind. The head is huge and fluffy and the lacing is insane. After a few minutes the head dissapears but you'd barely know it from viewing it from the side because of all the lacing stuck on it. 
I could smell this from at least a foot away when I popped it. Huge on the citrus hops with a splash of pine. There's a nice sweetness to it like a grapefruit with sugar on it. 
Delectable. Tastes just like it smells. Loads and loads of grapefruit, pineapple, and orange with a resinous follow up. The malt is spot on to add a touch of sweetness to offset the bitterness, which is also spot on. 
The mouthfeel is creamy, chewy, and clean. It has a very fresh feel that screams quality. Carbonation is light but cuts the body well. There's a slight astringency but it mellows as it warms. 
This is delicious but a palate bruiser. One of the better tasting DIPAs out there but because of the huge bitter bashing the toungue takes one bomber and I'm saying no mas. 1,131 charactersVonerichs, Jul 24, 2009
4.74/5  rDev +8%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Pours a very orange hued amber color with a nice firm, bright white head that slowly dissipates. Moderate visible carbonation.
Well all be ding dong. Huge whiff of freshly peeled orange on the first smell. The second round provides a solid push of sweetened pine resin, i am talking seriously strong pine. A touch of sweet caramelized malt at the end of the spectrum makes this far and out one of the best smelling brews I have had the opportunity to put my nose up to. 
The taste is chock full of super fresh grapefruit pith and (like in the nose) freshly peeled orange. A (I can't explain it either) strong but mild pine presence makes itself known right off the bat. The malt backbone is there, but it is hard to grasp after the aggressive hop assault on the tongue. Amazing, simply amazing. Almost no hint of the 9.5%. Almost perfection.
The mouthfeel is on frickin point. Ample carbonation and very slick on the tongue, nothing I can complain about. At all.
One of the best brews I have had to date. Hands down. I would be drunk and living on the streets if this was available in Minnesota. 1,099 charactersBDLbrewster, Jul 24, 2009
4.33/5  rDev -1.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Dreadnaught is easily one of the highest rated Imperial IPAs out there. Three Floyds almost never disappoints, so this beer has big shoes to fill. Here is my review:
A: Pours a nice golden color. Pretty hazy looking. Head is very foamy and leaves nice lacing on the glass. 
S: Smells very grapefruity. Lots of tropical fruits in there with some piney hops. 
T: For an Imperial IPA, this beer is exceptionally smooth. Very complex and not harsh at all. This tastes pretty similar to Bells Hopslam, but this one is definetly superior. Lots of grapefruit, pineapple, and mango. Also quite a bit of pine in there as well. There is a honey sweetness to balance out the hops. Bitterness is present, but not what you would expect from a beer of this calibur. Excellent.
M: Medium bodied and with only hints of bitterness. Not very dry for an IPA. More of a juicy mouthfeel. 
D: Again, this is probably as smooth as an IPA as you are going to get. Drinking a whole bomber should pose no threat. Very refreshing beer.
Without a doubt an excellent IPA, but not quite as stellar as the reviews make it out to be. My biggest fault of the beer is that it is too smooth. I prefer IPAs to have that harsh and dry bitterness in the end. Definetly superior to Hopslam, but I have had better offerings from Avery, Founders and even Lagunitas. Well worth seeking out and worth the money. 1,374 charactersOldSchoolGamer, Jul 20, 2009
4.32/5  rDev -1.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4This pours a magnificent hazy amber with a foamy head of about a half inch poured into my mug
Smells amazing, citrus fruits, like apricot, peach, soft grapefruit with a hop presence to be reckoned with in the background
Tastes very caramel sweet off the bat and then you taste this amazing citrus hit that tingles all your taste buds and finish it off with a strong IPA hop bite that I love when mixed with other flavors , wow wow wow.
Mouthfeel is medium to heavy range with a caramel sweet taste that lingers on the side of your mouth , and HOPS that come off your breath , very good.
With a mouthfeel and taste like that you have to admit this is a most drinkable IPA, and a damn fine one at that. 704 charactersbgreg3, Jul 19, 2009
4.53/5  rDev +3.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Pours a very pale orange, almost a dark straw yellow type color. Kind of light, it's fairly clear, with a bit of haze, on the second pour, I could watch a little cascade of haze fall through the beer. Really a beautiful sight. The head is massive, and pillowy, it looks loose, but it has incredible retention, and leaves some decent lacing. This one looks like PTE, it's a little paler than you'd like, but stands up perfectly in the other categories. The smell doesn't jump up immediately and punch you in the face. I could actually smell it, in brief intervals, at a distance, before I even tried, but it's not as powerful as some. The smell is very pungent. There's a leafy kind of spiciness, resting on top of some smells of tart fruits, maybe a bit of tropical fruits. Very little resinous smells, but there is a bit of citrus, like orange and maybe a bit of sweet grapefruit. The maltiness is slightly crackery and subdued, which is a good sign, it means this is fresh. The taste comes off upfront with a kind of sweet, powdery maltiness with a thick layer of grassy, almost herbal hops. Then comes the fruit, something is almost like biting into a young peach or plum, or maybe a juicy tart cherry. Really pleasant and great. The bitterness is subdued, but it comes in little bursts, along with some resins, and some citrus peel kind of feeling. The leafiness of the hops is really a great introduction to the ultimate taste, it kind of draws you in, then seems like something familiar, the turns to something altogether unfamiliar, it comes out punching, with the fruitiness, which is out of the ordinary, I mean, you can find it in other DIPAs, but a lot of times its battling with either bready malts, or really piney, grassy hops, but the fruitiness comes off alone here. Really interesting and wonderful. I'm really loving it more as I get into it. The body is perfect, the perfect balance between dry and sweet, it's a bit full, you know, with some nice sweetness and some hoppy resins, but it stays dry enough to keep you diving back in for another drink. This is definitely a bit more full than it appears. The carbonation is light, there's a nice tickle, and it keeps it lively without stinging. Nice. And overall, this is a brilliant beer. I mean, I could really see myself drinking this every day if I had the opportunity. If you ever get a shot to try it, and try it fresh, I would recommend it without hesitation. Really a standout DIPA. 2,457 characterstaylorhamrick, Jul 17, 2009
4.57/5  rDev +4.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Poured from the bottle at cellar temp ~50 degrees. A good 2 finger head the color of ripe apricots hung around while I drank from my snifter. A very intense smell of flowering orange trees, and grapefruit zest explodes immediately upon pouring. The major flavors are lemon peel, grapefruit and hops, hops, hops! The taste is complex beginning with an initial rush of cirtrus and quickly becomming a very smooth pine-y American-hops taste. Mouthfeel is velvety smooth which lends to the easy drinkability. The flavors work exceptionally well together; I think the bitterness will please any Imperial IPA drinker, and the smooth richness will attract most others!
Highly Recommended, don't pass this by. 702 charactersDrDCon, Jul 15, 2009
4.65/5  rDev +5.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Fresh from the brewery. Pours deep gold with only a slight veil. Three fingers of resilient head developed with a standard down-the-middle pour. The smell is mostly on the fruit side of the hop family: peach, lemon peel and pineapple, with a little bit of pine and carmel underneath to round things out. Mouthfeel is full-bodied with medium carbonation. The taste leads with a hop uppercut that should please any DIPA devotee: orange and mango make an appearance but pine is much more present in the taste than the smell would suggest. About halfway through a sip, the beer takes a brief malt break, giving you a nice taste of carmel to balance things out before the finale. The finish is classic for the style: prolonged, full-flavored bitterness with complex citrus accompanyment. A standout DIPA that demonstrates everything that hops can do. Pairs well with a spicy mole or rich BBQ pulled pork. 899 characterschicagobeerriot, Jul 13, 2009
4.72/5  rDev +7.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5A- Pours the standard light caramel-golden color with about an inch of sandy head. Laces very nicely.
S- This just smells great... very refreshing with some bright citrusy notes--grapefruit, lemon, orange--and some fresh leafy/floral notes too. It doesn't just smell like grapefruit, it smells like the whole branch with fresh grapefruits still attached.
T- Bitter, fades into sweet piney hops and some molasses. Remarkably well balanced. Sweet and orangey at the end... moves into some grapefruit too. Alcohol is barely noticeable, just enough to add a nice spicy kick. A great IIPA. Up there with my favorite IPA/IIPAs--Two Hearted, Furious, Hopslam, etc. Good company to be in.
M- Velvety with a medium body. Coats the whole mouth. Carbonation is perfect. Not too dry or prickly on the finish, just right.
D- Off the charts here. I could enjoy this all night. Surprisingly smooth and extremely flavorful, this is one of my favorite IIPAs.
EDIT: 2-8-10
Had this out of a fresh growler from the brewery the other day and it was simply divine. Reminded me of Hopslam, but so much better. Love this IIPA, best one out there, IMO. 1,134 charactersLordAdmNelson, Jul 07, 2009
3.98/5  rDev -9.3%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.522oz bottle poured into a Portsmouth goblet. Received in trade from rlcnmeyer - Thanks! I see no sign of a date or freshness code on the bottle.
A - Poured a hazy, pale orange with a one finger white head of intermingled large and small bubbles. Head fades after about a minute to a thin layer of bubbles distributed more or less evenly across the entire surface of the beer. Eventually fades leaving nice, thick lacing on the sides of the glass.
S - First smell yields large amounts of caramel and toffee-like malt - hints of molasses. Subtle floral hops come thru, but in a subdued way. Expected more hop aroma here.
T - Spicy hops overlaying thick malt base. Lots of caramel flavor blending nicely with the hop bitterness that is fighting thru the sweet malt. Some citrusy hop flavor balances nicely with the malts. Alcohol makes its presence known, not overwhelming, but definitely noticeable.
M - Mouthfeel is thick and smooth. Sweet malt coats the tongue and sides of the mouth. Carbonation is medium to a touch heavy. Leans towards being a sipping beer.
D - For a 9.5% beer, this is pretty quaffable. This 22 is going down quick and easy. This is a really enjoyable beer with big flavors and body, but goes down pretty easily. Everything blends well and makes this a really enjoyable big beer. 1,305 charactersportia99, Jul 02, 2009
4.54/5  rDev +3.4%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Bombers purchased at brewery during DLD09.
Appearance - bright but hazed, the beer pours a dirty tangerine color with a flat cream-colored head. It's on the thin side but puts a thin wall of lace all around the glass.
Aroma - great bouquet of mango, grapefruit, and pine. Very citrusy and zesty.
Taste - biscuity caramel malts have a twang of sweetness, segueing to the citrusy fruitines of the hops. Mango and pineapple at first, then going more bitter, like grapefruit rind. Dries out, stays bitter, but nothing medicinal. The finish has a bit of warmth along with the dry bitterness. A fairly intense experience flavorwise.
Mouthfeel - a touch heavy and thick. The carbonation is on the crisp side but struggling through the viscosity of this DIPA, as it should be.
Drinkability - the one Top 100 beer I've had the most of without reviewing it, until now. Bombers and bombers I've bought, fully intending to write one up, only to be lulled into its deliciousness. Finally scraped up enough patience. What a delicious DIPA, certainly my most familiar. 1,058 charactersbrewdlyhooked13, Jul 01, 2009
4.15/5  rDev -5.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I picked up a Bomber over the weekend.... Very excited to try it.
It's a really nice colored beer. Fairly orange in color, fairly cloudy.
The smell is ripe. Sweet fruity hops. No malt or yeast aroma whatsoever, this is all hops.
The taste was pretty damn good. Dank, citrusy hops. Sticky sweet. Excellent mouthfeel. Sticks to your lips. Oily, hoppy. Good stuff.
Is it as good as advertised? Probably not. Is it my favorite IIPA? No. Is it worth $10.99 a bomber? Hell no.
But it's a damn tasty brew that I would happily drink anytime. 538 charactersBrew33, Jul 01, 2009
4.12/5  rDev -6.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Big thanks to bulletrain76 for sharing.
Pours a great looking golden color with a nice two finger head and pretty decent lacing. One T-Rex rides piggyback on another in the foam. Weird. 
The scent is a nice combination of fruits; a lot more tropical fruits are here in a manner in which I don't usually come across in big IPAs. Pineapple and guava are just as present as the citrusy orange/grapefruit that I'm used to. Sweet on the nose, and slightly boozy. 
Taste follows the nose, with all of the above fruits with some carmelly brown-sugar malts noticeable as well. Well balanced, with a nice lightly bitter finish. Not too sweet. 
Crisp and slightly hot with a bitter but clean finish. Medium-high body and oily. 
Drinkability is pretty high, especially considering the ABV. Never comes off as too boozy or sweet...very nice. 
Overall, a very nice DIPA. I've had better, certainly, but I wouldn't hesitate to grab this at any opportunity I get. 954 charactersphotomike, Jun 20, 2009
4/5  rDev -8.9%look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to straffordmilitia for sharing this bottle with me.
The beer pours a pale, light golden orange, not nearly as murky as I have come to expect from a dIPA. There is a thin white head that fades, leaving an oily lacing on the sides of the glass.
The smell is pretty mild, some citrus and sugary malt.
The taste is a much more intense than the nose on this one. Blasts of bitter hop followed by tangy citrus notes, the malt in sugary notes in the smell are almost completely absent from the taste. The most interesting thing about this beer is the mango flavors that persist throughout and well into the aftertaste. 
The mouthfeel is great. Not too much alcohol presence and the beer is well carbonated, making it something that I could easily drink a few glasses of in one sitting. The aftertaste of this beer is worth noting, as it is almost as strong as the beer itself and it leaves me craving more of the beer. 923 charactersrpstevens, Jun 19, 2009
4.52/5  rDev +3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 522oz bottle. Honey-orange color with a medium white head that sticks to glass. Very nice aroma that is a showcase of fruity citrus like orange, grapefruit, and tangerine. all enhanced by a sweet maltiness. The flavor has tons of juicy hops that burst with grapefruit and tangerine. There is a big malt body that is on the sweet side, but a massive bitterness perfectly balances it. Full bodied with creamy carbonation. Malty, but in a way that enhances the hops instead of takes away from them. I was worried that I might not get a fresh bottle, but this seems pretty spot on as to what I was expecting. Maybe not the freshest, but hardly worse for wear. For how much hop goodness this exudes, the balance is spot on. 717 charactersbulletrain76, Jun 18, 2009
4.13/5  rDev -5.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Appearance: Comes off the pour somewhat viscous in appearance. Color is golden with tones of honey, and the carbonation shows moderately throughout. Head is a well-retained white and thick 1/2 finger skim that leaves behind tons of bubbly, sticky lacing.
Smell: Aroma is an earthy bitter scent with some citrus and slight pine. not too overwhelming and cut well with some bready malt. 
Taste/Mouthfeel: Taste is a very sweet, sticky bitter - some citrus, a little sap, some bready malt, hot alcohol vapors and a strong aftertaste. Apple skin and peaches, almost tropical flavors are very present in the aftertaste. The feel is very full and mouthfilling without being too heavy. It is sticky, oily and bright. 
Drinkability: Surprisingly high. I think Three Floyds really seems to do sticky, bitter and hoppy right. 818 characterskels, Jun 16, 2009
4.47/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Intense citrus hop aroma. Grapefruit aromas combined with some malty sweetness. Poured amber with huge off-white head with good retention. Malt flavors slightly dominate with hop bitterness right behind. A big malty beer with lots of hops (100IBU). Medium bodied with a dry finish; no lingering bitterness here. This is similar to the Apocolypse Cow, less the lactose milk sugar. A VERY GOOD Imperial IPA.

4.95/5  rDev +12.8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Poured In: Tulip Glass
Purchased From: Steve's Liquor (Madison, WI)
Appearance: This pours a nice cloudy orange color. A finger of head at the top of the glass, with lacing covering the tulip from head to toe. The head retention is excellent.
Smell: An exceptional smelling beer! As soon as I opened the bottle I could tell this was going to be a well put together IIPA. A very nice citrus aroma mixed together with a caramel malt. I'm putting my money on this bottle being quite fresh, because this hop aroma is fantastic.
Taste: Starts out with a nice piece of orange peel and mango, with a little caramel malt showing its face. A small amount of alcohol shined through, but still very well hidden. Hop oils are coating the mouth, and the beer finishes with a very pleasant grapefruit flavor.
Mouthfeel: A very well carbonated beer. Medium body. Goes down very easily.
Drinkability: With the high ABV, I don't think I could handle more than a single bomber of this, perhaps a bomber and a half. This was a fantastic beer. My first Three Floyds experience, and what a great start. 1,086 charactersEk0nomik, Jun 14, 2009
4.02/5  rDev -8.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Thanks to Kels for bringing this back from a recent trip to Indy. A very nice IIPA. The bottle says there are elements of peach and mango, and while I did not necessarily get those in my tasting of it, it was definitely a bit of a hop bomb that provided a ton of citrus.
Appearance: Pours a nice coppery orange color with minimal head, more of a thick very uneven skim; body appears mildy cloudy/hazy and seems to have pretty solid carbonation coming up; a spotty-oily lacing holds loosely to the sides of the glass. 
Smell: Citrusy hops -- big orange peel scent and some grapefruit; a firm yet downplayed malty back is bringing about a mild sweetness that is almost honey-like but it's barely there.
Taste: Really bitter citrus hops right up front, especially the orange peel, this bitterness is followed by a mildly semi-sweet juicelike sweetness (perhaps this is the peach/mango that I was not picking up on?); bitterness dominates overall though; the malty presence that is in the nose is not really present at all in the mouth; aftertaste is the orange peel and pungent bitterness.
Mouthfeel: Solid carbonation gives way to solid sticky coating; mouth and chest are warmed from the alcohol. Abotu what I would expect from a beer of this style and size.
Drinkability: Moderate - it's a nice tasting IIPA with plenty of powerful bitter flavor that makes it a bit of a sipper, but even if it wasn't for that, the bigger alcohol would slow me down. I could probably handle a couple of glasses in a night, but don't think I'd attempt much more. 1,549 charactersbamadog, Jun 10, 2009
4.64/5  rDev +5.7%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Bottle received from akokandy in a recent trade. Thanks so much, Adam! 
Poured into my snifter. Pours a hazy deep gold with about a half inch white head on top. Some decent lacing is left behind. The scent on this is rivaled only by the brothers Pliny. I could wear this as a cologne if possible. Huge piney floral hoppiness going on. Big bountiful scents just burst forth and bombard the nose. Absolutely wonderful!
Mouthfeel is crisp and pleasant for drinkability. Flavor is not as bitter and hoppy as I expected, but it is good nonetheless. Slight bitter hops right at the onset, but this gives way to a very sweet finish. This is balanced as all get out. Drinkability = freaking better believe it! I could drink this all night. 733 charactersOnenote81, Jun 02, 2009

22oz bomber with gold lowercase lettering (this is supposed to be one of the more recent batches). tasted in early april 2009.
pale amber with orange hue. faint haze. moderate, off-white head, gradually recedes to thin, wispy, almost creamy layer. some thin, webby rings of lace.
grapefruity aroma with touch of pine, plus an apple fruitiness underneath, then giving way to the caramel malt. finishes with more pine. all a bit subdued however.
taste: sweetly fruity, citrusy hops, with touch of pine, mixing with apple esters and caramel maltiness. resinous and piney hops return and give a moderate bitterness to counteract. note of honey in the background. finish is piney. all this said, it's not as fresh nor dynamic as hoped.
medium body, smooth, with light resins right before the finish. moderate carbonation, giving some body and fluffiness.
i believe this batch is just not as good as previous ones. my brother and i had fond memories of dreadnaught back at EBF '08. however, at EBF '09, we tasted it again, and were underwhelmed. seems to be confirmed here... 1,111 characterschinabeergeek, May 26, 2009
3.88/5  rDev -11.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4My second FFF offering, and it's breaking in the brand new Duvel tulip (thanks to the lady friend for the awesome gift). While the label isn't as terrible as the Alpha King one, it's still pretty lousy.
Appearance - Very nice orange/amber color. It has an inch or so of creamy head, and some very nice lacing. Almost glows.
Smell - A burst of nice citrus hops up front. Some nice grapefruit and some definite orange rind. A hint of that burnt sugar caramel malt, and maybe some pine round it out. Smells nice.
Taste - Lots of bitter hopness up front. Less citrus and more pine, unfortunately, since that's not my favorite. Has a real sweet malt behind it. That pine bitterness just keeps coming, frankly. Can get a hint of that grapefruit, but it's pretty overpowered. The bitterness hangs around pretty fiercely. 
Mouthfeel - Very nice and creamy. Not syrupy, which is a surprise. It's got a good, thick body. 
Drinkability - Not the best. The bitterness just hangs around so intensely I can't picture wanting another. 
This is a pretty good beer, but certainly not a favorite. It really brings a ton of hops, but it's so bitter that I really miss a citrus balance to sweeten it out for me. Just a ton of that pine blasting through everything. 1,250 characterscallmescraps, May 25, 2009

A- Poured into pint glass. Pours nice clear deep yellow almost slight amber color into the glass. 1/2 inch off white head falls after a minute or so leaving nice lacing that clings to the glass. 
S- Big citrus hop smell (pineapple, orange..ect). This is really present but later on there some malty backbone that finally shines through. 
T- This is a hop bomb for sure. Tons of grapefruit and citrus hops upfront. This gives way to a clean grainy (maybe malts?) finish. There is another flavor in here but I can't really tell what it is. The malts balance this out pretty nicely and don't take from the hop bomb aspect of it.
M- Pretty nice mouthfeel. I would have to say medium mouthfeel. The hops cling to the taste buds in this beer letting it linger around much longer than one would expect. Nice carbonation leaves the beer floating over your tounge. Good beer in this aspect.
D- FFF is one of my favorite breweries hands down. This beer I could drink more than one of as long as I was at home or else had a DD if I was out. Good to the last sip and I love it! 1,101 charactersalleykatking, May 25, 2009

Kind of piney but not much and citrus. Surprisingly not very bitter if any at all, goes down really smooth. All I can say is it taste awesome. Has a real nice mouthfeel too.

4.62/5  rDev +5.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Got this brew via trade with Chrizzle. My first completed trade.
Pours a nice see through orange color with a golden tint. One finger of foamy off white head, that will leave lacing down the entire glass.
Has a very big nose with a couple of different fruity flavors that stand out significantly. Pineapple, grapefruit, lemon. A caramel malted backbone, with a hint of alcohol. A complex smelling brew.
I'm so glad that I got to taste this beer. The taste is just as complex and flavorful as the smell. Big pineapple and grapefruit flavor. It has a sweet caramel/bready malt backbone. Delicious.
Overall, I thought this beer was amazing. I thought that it wasn't going to live up to the hype that I had created in my head, but it really did a good job of stepping it up. 774 charactersKBoudreau66, May 23, 2009

A: Pours a translucent orange / amber color with an inch of fluffy, off-white head. It falls to a collar and light film on the brew, but leaves substantial washes of lacing and thick register marks down the glass. 
S: Huge grapefruit, pineapple, and mango notes with floral hops as well. Coming in way behind is some caramel and biscuit malt. 
T: Hop bomb, as expected. Lots of citrus here, and it's present in a largely tropical pineapple and mango combination. Grapefruit is found, but in lesser quantities, and it rivals the caramel and biscuit malt flavors for attention. Toward the end of the taste there is a grain taste that gives way to a clean finish with a lingering hop bitterness in the aftertaste. 
M: Medium-bodied, with a slightly oily and resiny feel that coats the mouth and creates a slightly sticky flavor. A bitter aftertaste. Well-masked ABV, with no burn or even an indication of warmth. 
D: This seems to be a poor value, at around $10 a bomber, but it is a good DIPA. I'll probably stick with something local, though -- it'll be cheaper, fresher, and taste just as good if not better. 1,183 charactersArbitrator, May 19, 2009

S- Hops and fruit. citrus fruit. pineapple comes to mind. smells a lot like hopslam actually.
T- a little underwhelming at first. The hops dont come through as expected and there is actually more malt flavor than would be desired in a DIPA. This must be what people mean when they say they like their IPAs "balanced", but i dont get it. As i said, its malty, there is a hop bitterness, and lots of fruit flavors in between. It's good, but not what I expected.
M- This beer is insanely smooth on the palate. doesn't get much better in this department.
D- This drinks well, and i would definitely get it again if it were available in my area (but it is not). 808 charactersjdklks, May 15, 2009

Perfect head of about an inch after pouring this thick beer into my snifter glass. Head is very white and moderately frothy. Head takes a while to dissipate, leaving minimal retention. Excellent lacing. Nicely carbonated. Transparent golden orange in color.
Big classic DIPA nose of grapefruit citrus hops. Best nose of a midwest DIPA I've smelled. Actually right up there and quite comparable to the West Coast leaders in its class. Fresh, clean and very hoppy. I could see some complain about the lack of balance here, but I rather enjoy a hopbomb here and there.
The beer has now warmed to 49°F and I take my first sip. First I notice the strong malt backing that I could not detect in the nose. Surprisingly well balanced actually. Puckering grapefruit hoppiness confusing my tongue to believe it is moderately astringent which I do not believe it actually is.
The mouth is very thick and creamy. One of the fullest bodied DIPAs I've tried. Some grit/residue remains on the tongue leading to the mentionable citrus aftertaste. Surprisingly refreshing and drinkable but watchout for that ABV which comes in at a hefty 9.5%.
Well done FFF, excellent representation of its style and as this is my favorite style of beer, I am quite the critic. This still is 1uped by the likes of Pliny the Elder and Stone Ruination, but there certainly is some stiff competition, especially coming from the West Coast. 1,472 charactersibbjamin, May 15, 2009
4.59/5  rDev +4.6%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Solid one finger beige head atop an orange-tangerine haze. A bit of sheet lacing and wispy retention. 
The nose is the most exceptional I remember, an explosive burst of peach, mango and an array of wonderfully citrusy aromas, all hoppily inspired. Heavenly!
Taste is hoppy grapefruit, citrus zest, lime with a bitter aftertaste and malty impressions that develop with air and warming. Although refreshing and tasty, the mouthfeel is very dry and bitter with substantial body consistent with the style, anchored by a distinct maltiness. Alchohol superbly handled. 
Overall, this is an excellent example of the Imperial IPA style, daunting and assertive with great balance. It's almost overpowering at times, novices should take this seriously, a masterful Three Floyds production hopefully not to be missed by the serious beer drinkers out there. Thanks, biegaman for putting this aside for me. 897 charactersThatWineGuy, May 14, 2009
4.38/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Served from a bomber, poured into a pint glass...
A: Bright, clear golden-yellow color, clean white head and nice stream of carbonation rising up from the bottom of the glass
S: Aroma is heavily grapefruit and flowery, from the hops
T: Great balance of grapefruit, orange, and earthy hops taste. Hop flavor is definitely dominant.
M: Very well-balanced beer. Lots of hops, as expected, but they're not overpowering, and thus each sip was as easy as the one before it.
D: Enjoyable IPA with enough flavor to keep one satisfied, but not enough to come across too strong and make this one only drinkable in small servings. Was quite happy to drink the whole bottle, and didn't feel like my tastebuds were overwhelmed by the end. 726 charactersVitaEBella87, May 12, 2009
4.5/5  rDev +2.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I've had a few bottles of Dreadnaught in the past, but they've never tasted fresh, and I've always been disappointed. The freshness issue seems to be a common one with Dreadnaught, and it's one that could be resolved with the use of bottle dating. Anyway, this is a review and not a discussion about that. A trading partner recently picked this up from the brewery and I do believe this one will be fresh. Thanks a lot Deuane.
Poured aggressively into an imperial pint glass, the white head flares up to two fingers high, and recedes very slowly. The lacing left on the glass can only be described as profuse. It's left clinging everywhere to the glass. The beer is dark orange and transparent.
The beer does indeed smell fresh. My nose is greeted with the aroma of pine resiny hops, and bitter grapefruit. The malt backbone is substantial and it imparts a noticeable caramel sweetness. Only a little alcohol is noticeable in the aroma. Hoppy yet sweet.
The flavor has a medium-high level of bitterness with a lot of hop character. The oily hops do battle with the sweet malt backbone, and I'm inclined to say they win. The hops taste like bitter grapefruit, orange pith, and pine resin. The long finish is sweet and bitter, with a small amount of alcohol. The alcohol is very well hidden for such a potent Imperial IPA.
The beer is medium bodied with good carbonation and an oily, sticky mouthfeel. This beer is bursting with hop flavor. I'm really glad to finally try this fresh. I definitely see why people rep this beer. It's not as dry as the West Coast hop bombs I've come to love, but the beautiful hop character in the flavor and aroma are still present, and I enjoy the added malt sweetness that Dreadnaught has. 1,725 charactersHopHead84, May 12, 2009
3.03/5  rDev -31%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 2.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3Thanks to BitterPachyderm for this bomber, poured into an oversized snifter.
Pours a bright copperish amber with a finger off-white head. Decent head retention and lacing. 
Smells like a tropical fruit medley. Pineapple, orange, kiss of grapefruit, maybe the mango suggested on the bottle. Caramel malt definitely noticeable. 
Tastes very fruity. The tropical fruits mentioned above, plus some peach and apple. Light sweet malt backbone. Gotta ask, though: where the heck is the bitterness? After smelling, I was hoping for something along the lines of Hop Stoopid (fruity but also with a significant punch of hops). What I got was the fruitiness without the hops.
Medium bodied, moderate carbonation. Juicy mouthfeel, but no bitterness in the finish (or anywhere else, really). 
Overall impression: Is it possible that my palate is tainted from all the west coast hop monsters? I found this beer pleasantly drinkable, but entirely lacking in the "angry" bitterness I expect from a DIPA. Maybe it was an old bottle (hard to believe a beer this popular would sit around on store shelves going past its prime, though). If I have another chance to try it and have a different experience, I'll adjust my review/scores accordingly. 1,231 charactersPDXHops, May 09, 2009
4.52/5  rDev +3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5So we finally rented our condo after many months of stress so we decided to celebrate and what better way than with my first taste of a 3F which is a fresh Dreadnaught courtesy of MasterSki. Shared with my wife.
Paired with some delicious pizza from Como while watching the last 10 minutes of American Idol and all of Fringe.
Poured from a 22oz. bomber.
Appearance: Deep orange body. Hazy looking with a 1 finger head (more foam/lacing when i pour in my wife's glass) and very active carbonation.
Smell: Citrus fruit, more specifically fresh & ripe mango. Good piney hop smell but not overpowering the other aromas. Very good.
Taste: I'm hit with the fresh mango again and i literally get a mental image of eating a mango. A slightly sweet fruit taste with some peach fuzz as well. Some discreet pine and my wife says it has a peppery feel to it. The taste definitely more than backs up the smell.
Mouthfeel: Good balance between malt and hops but tends more to the malty side. Almost no bitter hops which disappointed me a little but nonetheless i can't argue that this is a greatly constructed brew. Very smooth and feels a little juicy. Bitterness opens up a little as it warms.
Drinkability: Insanely drinkable. ABV is completely masked by the taste which makes me want to keep tasting it. Would get more in a pinch for sure.
Overall: This is a supremely well-crafted, well-balanced beer that tends to the more smooth, malt-like feel. I love this beer and my only regret is i only had one. Seek this one out but make sure it's fresh! 1,545 characterspapat444, May 07, 2009

Smells briskly of hops, bitter malt, pine, rind, and maybe a little fruit.
Flavor is both strong and complex. Notes of bitter hops through the front with a mellowing sweet taste with undertones of maybe peaches.
The finish is crisp and the lasting taste of bitter and dark fruit lasts well.
Exceptionally drinkable and smooth. 421 charactersThaBobfather, May 06, 2009
4.75/5  rDev +8.2%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Thanks to Yetiman420 for his generosity; a truly great BA. Split the bomber with a friend and poured my half into my Duvel Tulip glass.
A: Poured light caramel-colored, minimal head, which was off-white, and there were some non-fermentables floating in the beer.
S: Pineapple and grapefruit up front, which smells absolutely delicious! There are also other tropical fruit smells in there - passion fruit maybe? There is a sweeter smell overall. Near the end of the beer I picked up some notes of piney hops, both regular and a sweet pine smell. This was very pleasant. As I took a few final wafts of the beer before I finished it I was to pick up some mango in the nose.
T: More of a tarty-citrus flavor - hard to decipher grapefruit from a tart mango before it finishes, clearly, with a tart grapefruit flavor. The finish is very bitter, which I enjoy thoroughly. Overall, the taste is more of a tart, citrusy, bitter taste, which is opposite from the nose's sweeter overall flavoring. There may even be a tart peach flavor in there as well. As the beer warms and I move through it I am picking up some orange flavoring. This beer hides the alcohol VERY well.
M: Light for an Imperial IPA. Good stickiness/ oiliness from the hops - heavy when I started the beer, but it lightened up as I moved through it. This is a very smooth beer, with great carbonation - perfect for the style.
D: This beer is very, very good, both in style and out of style. This is one of my favorite beers of all time, 3rd to be exact, only behind PtY and PtE, respectively. I wish I was in the FFF distribution area. 1,597 charactersaglose45, May 05, 2009

S - Not as much hop presence as you would expect from an IIPA but the citrus notes are very nice. The mango flavor is present along with lemon/orange. A little bit sweet at the end, maybe from the malt.
T - The hops and citrus flavors blend well. Again, not as much hops present as in most IIPA's but they are definitely there. The mango flavor is pretty awesome as well as the background citrus flavors at the beginning with the hops intruding very quickly. It has a slight raisin-y finish as well.
M/D - Not much carbonation on this one with a medium body, slightly on the syrupy/thick side. Very smooth though on the palate with not much trace of alcohol flavoring.
A very well done citrusy IIPA with complex flavors in the beginning, middle, and end. Wish I could have this available in my area :-( 890 charactersVaTechHopHead, May 05, 2009

A - Pours a golden/yellow amber color with a cream colored finger of head. Moderate lacing.
S - The second I crack the bottle you could smell the hops. Pine, citrus, floral, and earthy hops roundhouse to the nose. There's a decent malt backbone as well.
T - It's all there. Hops every which way followed by a caramel malt backbone. A tinge of alcohol finishes.
M/D - Light, but coats your mouth. Good carbonation and drinkability for the abv, not abrasive at all.
This is a freakin awesome DIPA that I'd love to have access to. Easily a top 3 DIPA. 628 charactersxpimptastikx, May 05, 2009

S: Incredible. What a smorgasbord of hopy aromas. I get everything out of this: intense floral, moderate citrus, and faint pine. Heavily perfumed. 
T: The taste is almost as good as the smell. Starts with a dry grapefruit bitterness and then peppercorns. The malt finds its way through, but this beer (thankfully) is all about the hops. Finishes a little sweet, but then the tongue pricking bitterness returns on the very end. 
M: Medium bodied. Medium carbonation. Lively. Finishes dry, almost to the point of astringency. 
D: This is my preferred style of beer and this is probably one of he best representations out there. For me, drinkability would never be an issue; I could drink these until I passed out. With that said, this is an assertive beer and it makes its presence known.

4.47/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Man this stuff is good!
Pours a peach color that's somewhere between yellow and orange. Head's there but tends to be a thin sheen when you don't aggressively pour it.
It's hoppy...obviously. The main thing is the sheer amount of scents and flavors coming from those hops. Pineapple, pear, mango, citrus, pine, maraschino cherries, rum, and a surprising amount of malt. This is a flavor assault, but it's not really boozy at all. In fact, that 9.5% can catch up to you before you know it. Bitterness is there, but the malt's there to keep everything in order.
Goes down deceptively easy and I could see splitting several of these bombers with friends.
Definitely one of the best DIPA's around. I'd love to do a side by side with Maharajah as they're similar.
Anyway - get this if you ever see it. It's wonderful. 811 charactersDomingo, May 02, 2009

T: Again, lots of hops that pack in the bitterness and sweetness. A pretty good malt base backing everything up.
M: Fairly light carbonation with a light-to-medium body.
D: Quite drinkable. Not as much to handle as something like HopSlam, but not quite as tasty either. All around, definitely one of the top five DIPA's that I've had. 627 charactersThorpe429, Apr 29, 2009

Poured from the bomber into my Sam Adams Turbulator. A 1'' white head forms receeding to a colarof retention. Laces leaves thin streaking lace drapeage and plenty of rings. 
The color is a transparent golden orange heu with a slight bit of chill haze. 
The aroma is a big citrus bomb of pineaple, grassy hops, lots of citrus and orange peel, plenty of grapefruity hops and all around delicious sweet sweet nectar.
Carbonation tickle upfront with a juicy hop bursting and plenty of sweetness. Malt upfront before the hops take over. But once they do the malt is still allowed acess to my tounge. Lots of sweet juicy hops up front and into the swallow, grapefruit, oranges a bit of a lemon zest. Bittering moreso after the swallow with plenty of lang lasting hop linger. Finishing with still a touch of sweetness.
The mouthfeel is a crisp carbonated one with only a little tackyness to it, and also a little slickness. 
No alcahol warming from the aroma. But as the beer has warmed I got just a mild hint of warming through the swallow.
Absolutly delicious!!! 1,091 charactersBuebie, Apr 18, 2009

S - A very pleasing, pungent aroma. Just like the bottle says, there is some nice mango, peach, and citrus in the aroma. There's also some definite sweet caramel mixed in there.
M - It has a nice light-medium body and is smooth and refreshingly clean on the palate.
T - This is a great example of a very well balanced beer. The hops and malts complement each other almost to perfection. A nice caramel malt backbone is present throughout with some citrus, and mango in the middle and finish. A little bit of a peach flavor at the end and there really isn't any bitterness. I couldn't taste the alcohol whatsoever.
A superb DIPA. I've had this on tap and from a bottle and can't really say one is better than the other. 3 Floyds makes some unique, and interesting beers, and this one most definitely doesn't disappoint. This isn't your typical grapefruit, bitter hopped up DIPA. It's balanced and squeezes all sort of flavors out of the hops. A must try for any DIPA fans. 1,159 charactersboralyl, Apr 18, 2009

Leaves a little tar on the tongue which soon dissipates. 
Alpha King is one of my favorite beers. This was like Alpha King on steroids. Possibly too much?
This is an awesome drink. But for the money, I think Sierra Nevada's Wet-Hop Harvest Ale delivers a lot of the same pleasurable experience at a much cheaper price. I know they are not the same style, but I'm just saying, dollar for dollar... 657 charactersPrinceDarren, Apr 17, 2009
4.92/5  rDev +12.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Drank this while listening to Bill Callahan's album, "Sometimes I Wish I Were An Eagle."
Appearance: First let me say that drinking this beer has been a long time coming and now the time is here. Dreadnaught pours a very nice warm coppery orange color. It has only minimal cloudiness. There is an average amount of off-white/tan head that doesn't stick around for very long. A brisk swirl will give you about two fingers worth. There is a very good amount of gooey lacing on the sides of the glass that slowly bring their way back down to the rest of the beer. 
Smell: Fuggin' A this is about the cleanest smelling IPA I've ever had the privilege of sniffing. I should have put on a diaper before opening this bottle because I think I've just shat myself. The hop presence is just phenomenal; enough to make you grin from ear to ear. I mean I'd almost sell my car for a case of this aroma. There is a heavy load of citrus and pine in this one, and it also contains the faint pineapple, grapefruit, and mango components that are prevalent in some of the more brilliant IPAs out there. Mainly, though, it's like sticking your nose in a freshly opened bag of pressure-sealed hops. I mean this just smells gorgeous - I know because I can't get my nose out of the glass. The anticipation of drinking this beer has now been elevated even more. Here goes...
Taste: Okay now that I'm up off the floor from fainting..! This thing is like a hop lover's wet dream. Right away there is an enormous amount of spiciness and bitterness from the hops. The flavor doesn't immediately hit you as strongly as the nose would suggest, but after swallowing it you can really taste the magnificence of this bad mutha (shut yo mouth). I definitely taste the hops in this one. You can definitely tell that there is a good amount of malt playing a supporting role here, but you really won't care. It's every bit as good as I'd hoped and probably the best $12 I've ever spent in my life. 
Mouthfeel: The tongue just rejoices when Dreadnaught hits it. The bitterness is one that lingers for a little while and holds the flavors along with it. What makes this remarkable on the palate, though, is that it is just bitter enough, but it never becomes too much. After the beer has gone down your throat, it still hangs around and just radiates itself nicely on the palate. 
Overall: So many people claim that their IPA is a hop lover's dream, but Three Floyd's ain't kidding. I've had Bell's Hopslam and Russian River's Pliny the Elder so I was really curious to know where this one stood amongst them. It's not as pineapple-y as the Hopslam and it's certainly more intense than the Pliny. This one fits very nicely in-between them all. To put it bluntly, Dreadnaught is stunning in every way and everything I'd hoped it would be. It epitomizes everything I love in a good double IPA: balanced; bitter; aromatic as hell; and drinkable beyond belief. A super fresh Hopslam is the only thing I've had thus far that can hold a candle to it. Thank God I was able to get a couple of these because I'd be sad if this were the only time I'd get to enjoy this beer for a while. Get divorced, sell your home, or take out a loan from a bank; but whatever you do get yourself a few bottles of this love. There is a reason why this is number one on many peoples' sites.

3.97/5  rDev -9.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5Bottle into red wine glass - big thanks to Dev (buckeyesox) for this one.
Pours a beautifully bright clear copper, vibrant bright orange, with a soapy thin head and incredible lacing. Really disappointed in no head at all though.
Nose is intense, fresh, if a bit one dimensional - bright, intensely sweet citrusy grapefruit rind, mango, spicy, with a caramel underpinning. 
Taste follows the nose. Big caramel up front, bit toasty, nice citrusy grapefruit note, and a big, firm underlying bitterness, prickly. I was expecting a much bigger dose of hop flavor from this one, but I feel like the caramel drowns it out a bit, leaving the bitterness only. No pine really, just the huge integration of citrus and caramel that leaves the two nigh inseparable over the bitter, prickly finish.
As a note, this one deserves to be drank warm, closer to room temperature. Much improved at that stage.
Mouthfeel was slick and syrupy, with a fluffy carbonation up front that eventually moves to a bit under-carbonated. 
Drinkability is kind of iffy for me on this one - more emphasis on hop flavor and less on bitterness would probably bring it up a notch or two, but as it is I'd be happy with about a pint of this all told.
A nice beer, but it was dealing with expectations that were impossible for it to attain I think, having had a 2 week old Pliny a few days before. Dreadnaught is still a Prince, understand, but Pliny is still King. Apples and Oranges, yes, but when someone asks you what's your favorite fruit... 1,514 charactersJohnQVegas, Apr 14, 2009

Big, orange beer. Nice looking, though not much head. Smell exhibits tons of apricot and peach. Nice as it is different from a lot of the piney/citrusy west coast IPAs. A lot of what I would describe as perfume. Quite a lot of malt for a DIPA and very sweet. Beer is very balance as the bitter hops are balanced by the malt. I am sure this is a good quality, but I tend to like the hop bombs. Very fruity taste, but again, a bright floral peach/apricot rather than grapefruit. Mouthfeell and drinkability take a hit for me as Dreadnaught is a bit thick and syrupy, which is a huge knock in my book. Might just be a style preference, but there are a number of West Coast IPAs that I prefer to Dreadnaught. At $12 a bomber? Good stuff, still.... 808 charactersyeastsipper, Apr 14, 2009

A-Pours a hazy amber, more on the orange side of the spectrum. On the first pour a small head is produced that goes quickly into a few bubbles around the rim. A second pour results in a ring that stays a lot longer with much better head retention.
S-Sweet malt hits first and is quite predominant. Citrusy hops jump in next, followed closely by their floral cousins. Booze can definitely be detected. 
T-Tastes a whole lot like it smells. The sweet malt flavor hits first, followed by citrusy hops that taste like pineapple and fresh peppery mango. The booze is also hitting my palate.
M-Lower carbonation with a thick, chewy mouthfeel. It is fairly oily but is lacking in the bitterness factor.
D-Too sweet for me and lacking in the bitterness category.
I was very excited to try this beer and left feeling disappointed. After so much hype I felt I was getting an incredible DIPA and I felt I was left with more of a malt bomb. In fairness, I could not date the freshness of this bottle. I would love to try this fresh from the source in order to gauge a true opinion, but until then I will be glad to have Pliny and Hop Stoopid readily available. 1,281 charactersmjl21, Apr 12, 2009
4.32/5  rDev -1.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 422 oz bomber thanks to the great spointon for a crack at this brew. I have heard a lot about this brew and all has been good, so why not give it a shot. The artwork is crazy in typical FFF fashion. Served this one up in my shaped DFH pint glass. 
A: Pours a pretty dark orange that has some reddish brown hues to it. Held to the light, it comes through as a more yellow to really light orange color. The pour got me a little over a finger of pristine white head. The retention is just ok, falling to a semi-thick collar. The head that remains does create some really sticky lacing and really coats the glass well. The only thing that frightens me about this beer is the fact that I can see little to none carbonation activity. Freaks me out a bit. Still a good looking brew.
S: Smell is . . . well, quite hoppy. Getting a lot of grapefruit rind coming out here at th start. Then comes a really resiny pine, I mean some heavy pine. This actually smells like freshly cut pine. Then there is a slight medicinal and astringent smell. There is a slight presence of caramel, malty sweetness poking through, but its not toning down these hops. Very nice.
T: Yet again those hops shine. The pine is the initial flavor though. Lots of resin and green pine flavor. Then comes some of that citrusy and puckering grapefruit presence. That medicinal quality does come in a bit heavy in the flavor, but it works to cool down that pine and grapefruit. The malt once again pokes its head in to see whats going on but doesn't really contribute to the party. Just a touch of sweet caramel that soothes and rubs up against these hops. Really helps here.
M: Medium in body with a pretty slick and oily feel. Really coats with some oily quality. Carbonation is pretty light here which is a bit weird but it works. Makes this beer feel a little heavier, but still remains refreshing. This beer finishes pretty dry with a bit of ABV heat resting on the palate and at the back of the throat. Aftertaste is that medicinal hops presence.
D: This beer is pretty damned good actually. Its pretty much all hops, and its a hops lover's dream for sure. The flavor remains balanced as far as crazily hopped beers go. By balanced I mean the hops are balanced and really meld together well. The malt really doesn't stand a chance at all. Everything about this beer says quality and is really enjoyable. Easy drinking and actually sits pretty light in the stomach. Fine beer. 2,445 characterseveretends, Apr 07, 2009
4.5/5  rDev +2.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 1 pint 6 oz amber bottle.
Appearance - Orange/amber in color. Clear with a lively carbonation. A huge ivory head formed upon the initial pour. Medium bubbles which leave a rocky meringue-like surface. Ample lacing. 
Smell - The inital aroma was the typical hop/citus nose, but unlike a majority of DIPAs I actually find a large malty aroma as well. A bit of a biscuit aroma as well, along with a caramel presentation. The hop presence was not an overpowering piney/citrusy nose, once you got past the intial presentation. 
Taste - The malty sweetness is actually the first thing that hits me with this beer, and I'm glad for it. The opening is all about a malt balance that I have not often found in a DIPA. The finish is impressively dry, due to the hop bite finish. 
Mouthfeel - Very thick and chewy. Lots of sweet malt "sticky" leftovers as well. The carbonation is right on with this one. Good amount to assist in slinging this around your mouth. 
Drinkability - I liked this better than Pliny the Elder. There, I've said it. I was quite impressed with the balance of this DIPA. It wasn't "all about the hops" and this takes alot of balls to still brew this one strong. Well done. 1,203 charactersNesued, Apr 07, 2009
4.5/5  rDev +2.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Appearance: This beer is a deep amber color with a bit of red thrown in. Not a lot of head as you pour. Thin white patchy head and a nice glob of lacing that sticks to the side of the glass when you take a swig.
Smell: This is awesome, plenty of very fresh citrus hops with a little malt smell in the background. Some other exotic fruit smell I cant quite put a finger on. 
Taste: A highly floral bitterness from the hops followed by a bit of sweetness. There is the obvious grapefruit citrus taste. I like this aside from most dipa's because it is not too sweet like a lot of other dipa's are.
Mouthfeel: Thick and lightly carbonated a bit syrupy nice feel to it.
Drinkability: This is a delicious beer but I would refrain from pounding like frat boy as it is a more of bitter dipa. This is more of a sipper. 813 charactersnicnut45, Apr 06, 2009

It's got a very nice citrusy aroma but the flavor doesn't hold up to other DIPAs I've had. Had a pretty malty flavor and mouthfeel, more than I'm looking for in this style. Still decent but not really my thing. 267 charactersjfunkk79, Apr 05, 2009
3.9/5  rDev -11.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.522oz bomber, capped off our night of tasting Three Floyds beer, thanks to alleykatking. Vibrant hazed orange, thick head, nice lacing. There's really a lot going on with this beer. Yes, hops a' plenty in the nose and up front in the taste, fruity and floral, but there's a huge sweet malt character to this beer as well. It almost takes over for the hops, providing a sweet creaminess under the hops. Almost like vanilla ice cream. The flavors really battle each other here a bit, and I'm not sure if I could say this beer is well balanced, but it makes for an interesting brew, and a nice change next to the many super piney IPAs out there. Thick, chewy mouthfeel. A little hot perhaps, but this is a great beer. Unique for the style, and that's always a plus in my book. 772 characterstwelvsies, Apr 05, 2009
3.47/5  rDev -21%look: 3 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5I received this bottle in a trade from alleykatking. Thanks Josh!
A hard pour into my pint glass failed to give me much of a head. The resulting thin head disappeared in less than a minute, leaving a white ring with sparse larger bubbles from the pour. Low carbonation. A hazy tangerine body shows itself from the unfiltered nature of this beer. I'm cool with that because I like yeast in my alcoholic treats.
There's a strong hop presence, but there's so much malt, it contributes a substantial sweetness to the aroma that I notice immediately. I also smell sweet oranges and tangerines combined with a bit of diacetyl.
Tastes pretty much as I smelled. Strong hops infusion with a buttery, fruity, high malt body. I like it, but I don't love it. This does all make for a silky smooth body though. I really enjoy the low carbonation and massive malt combination. This really glides right over my tongue.
I like this DIPA but I'm not excited about it. Maybe I'm just used to the San Diego Style DIPAs so readily available in Orange County. The mouthfeel of Dreadnaught is a feel I love on high gravity beers that are malt forward, but I think this beer would benefit from the crispness of higher carbonation. I see this beer as a good candidate for aging into a remarkable barleywine. Would I buy more if it were available? Perhaps. If you're a hophead though, it's one to add to the list. 1,392 characterskinnaird, Apr 03, 2009

Looks a hazy amber with a pencil-thin head that makes an exit as soon as the pour is complete. Smell is lovely, sweet carmel malt with just the right amount of citrus hops to let you know this is an IPA! 
I love this beer's taste. It sports a perfect balance to it that eludes my humble discriptors. It's balanced but still has that hop kick to it that I adore. The alchohol is also hidden very well. So well in fact I'm having a hard time believeing this is a 9+%er(wasn't marked anywhere on the bottle). It's nice to try this, as I can compare it to nothing we get here out west(mabye a stretch would be double-dog...mabye)
Glad I sought this gem out and thanks again abbddull for getting this one off my wants-list! 780 charactersironlung, Apr 03, 2009

S: Tropical fruit, grapefruit, citrus and piney hops. This smells divine.
T/M: Excellent. Everything on the smell, with citrus flavors and piney hops prominent. This one shares characteristics with the Russian River Pliney's in that it's exceptionally well balanced and the bitterness on the finish is muted. Nothing worse than bitterness that just blows away everything.
D: Hides its alcohol extremely well. The lack of huge bitterness from finishing hops on the end also adds to the drinkability.
An amazing double IPA, up there with the RRBC Pliney, which had previously been my benchmarks. I can see why this one is widely acclaimed. 752 charactersabfraser, Apr 03, 2009
4.28/5  rDev -2.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Love this beer. On tap @ FFF's. Pours medium-dark orange in color with a white head. Smells fruity/citrus with a good amount of hops. Right off the bat, you are hit over the head with that wonderful hoppy taste and a slight amount of citrus taste. Soooo fresh! Good mouthfeel, medium carbonation, very clean finish. This beer beats the crap out of your taste buds so 1 bomber or a couple of tulips towards the end of the night is a good idea. 442 charactersSean9689, Apr 03, 2009
3.85/5  rDev -12.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Thanks to keithricker for this one in a trade. I've been looking forward to trying this for a while. 
Pours a slightly straw-y copper color with minimal head. The bubbles are very slowly climbing up the sides of the glass, which gives it a great effect. The lacing left is really nice. 
The nose is of super citrus! Lots of mingling scents, including oranges, grapefruit, lemon/lime, pineapple, along with the regular, piney, hoppy aromas. Really nice smell. 
The citrus that was in the nose is not nearly as evident in the taste (unfortunatly). There is some citrus, but it is mostly piney, bittery, hops. Has a decent hop backbone, and is drying in the finish. The drying aspect is the nicest part of the taste, IMO. 
This beer is extremely bitter, so dont think that more than one bomber is a great idea, unless you dont want to be able to taste for a week. 864 charactersmikecharley, Apr 02, 2009

S: Very piney with a bit of a floral undertone. Smells very hoppy. 
T: A bit more floral in the taste but still pretty piney. 
M: Medium bodied with good amount of carbonation and hops. Leaves a nice hop oiliness in your mouth too. 
D: Pretty good for a DIPA. I could get down a bomber very easily! 426 charactersdrgonzo3705, Apr 01, 2009
4.28/5  rDev -2.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4An absolutely beautiful Dark orange, or amber color with a big white fluffy head that stuck around for a short while. 
Mango, orange and grapefruit dominate the aroma, with some alcohol and bready malt character filling in the rest. 
Big and juicy. Lots of tropical fruit, mango, and ripe citrus mostly grapefruit but orange also makes an appearance. A little bready character fills in the holes and once again but to a lesser extent alcohol character is noticeable. 
Excellent mouthfeel. Big, juicy and wet, with subtle dry finish from the hop. Great carbonation with an oily syrupy body. 
All in all a fantastic beer. One of the best double IPA that I have had the opportunity to drench my tongue with. 704 charactersalovesupreme, Apr 01, 2009

Strong scents of grapefruit/pineapple/pine coming off of this. The taste has quite a strong hop profile, dries the mouth out a bit. Wonderful grapefruit aftertaste, slight sweetness mid-profile. Surprisingly light mouthfeel for an almost 10% DIPA. Wonderfully drinkable. Awesome DIPA. 355 charactersyoungblood, Mar 31, 2009
4.64/5  rDev +5.7%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5A= Great translucent amber color with a small head that is dense and leaves some spotty lacing. The head lasts throughout the entire drink surprisingly.
S= I can smell sweet hops from a ways away. A lot of grapefruit comes in. Smells like a sweet ripe Texas ruby red grapefruit. Some softer orange comes in as well but not as predominate. 
T= Smooth grapefruit. Very nice soft hop taste. Not overly bitter but still has a nice bit to it. Just right. Possible small amounts of the pineapple you taste in some hops just because it's so sweet. Delicious
M= Low carbonation which I really enjoy with the style. All IPAs should have a low carbonation in my opinion it makes it so much smoother
D= Very high. This beer was great. I wish Minnesota got Three Floyds. Lives up to everything that I expected. 798 charactersjjanega08, Mar 31, 2009
4.06/5  rDev -7.5%look: 3 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4So, yeah, hey, I really liked this right off the bat. The color is a bit light (way light) and the head? What head? But it smells good and tastes good. Of course, then I thought about it for a couple of seconds. Right. Of course I like this right off - it tastes really familiar... Why, it's just like a Cascazilla! I ran down to the local store and grabbed one - to compare. So, here's the deal... The dreadnaught is like cascazilla with a little HSA thrown in (for a little more body and a bit of diacetyl). Well, and the color is a little lighter than the cascazilla, too.
Funny thing is that more of you have tasted this than the other so the comparison isn't going to mean squat to you. What it means to me is that this is pretty darned good, but. Yeah. But. I had the other first so I like it better so neener. Or, if you just upped the body on the casazilla, why, you could have just about the same beer (don't talk to me about 10 - that's got nothing to do with cascazilla or dreadnaught either, for that matter).
OK, enough editorializing, I suppose. Now about the beer... Well... Darn it - it's a weak and pale cascazilla (with more body)! Arg! I mean, seriously. It's good beer, but drinking side by side you really get the feeling it's the same beer only more flavor in the casca and more body (and diacetyl) in the dreadnaught.
So, um. In terms of a DIPA, yeah, it's pretty close to there. Could use some more body and siome more bitterness. Balance seems pretty good for where it is. It's a good beer. Nice and hoppy. Nice. Needs more to be excellent. 1,568 characterscharlesw, Mar 28, 2009
3.83/5  rDev -12.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Pours incredibly clear, a nice amber color. This is only my second beer from FFF, both have been crystal clear.
Smell is really pine like. Wasn't too big on it at first but I began to warm up to it after a few sips.
Taste pretty much backs up the smell; very pine like, a bit of a grapefruit taste.
Pretty drinkable, the alcohol is well hidden.
Not a bad DIPA, but not my favorite. Glad I had it but probably a one time taste given what seems to be a bit expensive for this one. 482 charactersjpalarchio, Mar 27, 2009
4.5/5  rDev +2.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I finally got my hands on one of these thanks to my sister taking a recent trip to Chicago.
Pours pinkish orange with a light fizzy head. Smell is pure grapefruit.. maybe with a hint of pine needles. There's a strong flood of bitter hops and grapefruit right away which stays with you. Finish is bitter pine syrup. Alcohol (nearly 10%ABV) is hidden fairly well, and doesn't really stand out at all. Thick and creamy mouthfeel.
This isn't the hoppiest or most overwhelming IPA I've had, but it is extremely drinkable and very enjoyable. Excellent. 548 characterswebmanspidey, Mar 27, 2009
4.79/5  rDev +9.1%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.522 oz bottle purchased for me by a friend at Keg Liquors in Indiana. Poured into a Duvel Tulip.
A: Pours a very clear brownish orange color with a small amount of off-white head that dissipates quickly into a slight haze. The bubbles stick to the side of the glass on occasion. The ABV is a bit high on this one so maybe that affects the retention and lacing.
S: Now this is a hoppy aroma. I can not smell anything except hop aroma. Floral, citrus, and piney all mingled together in harmony. Absolutely wonderful aroma.
T: Based on the aroma, I expected an over the top bitter experience. However, just like the aroma, the mix of flavors is absolutely perfect. It is like a symphony of hop flavors in the mouth. The finish is really clean and not really bitter at all. A perfect example of using hops for flavor. The alcohol level does not come through in the flavor at all.
M: A unique experience for an IPA. It is very full bodied and thick compared to most others in the style. The carbonation makes it smooth and creamy as well.
D: It goes down pretty easily for such a high hopped and ABV beer. The alcohol is well hidden and the hoppy flavor is fantastic without being bitter.
I will be honest, I really did not want to like this beer this much. I think there prices on their beers are pretty high, and the limited distribution really is a pain in the ass. With that said, I have to give this beer its due. I think it is one of the best beers that I have ever had, certainly the best of the style that I have had. 1,525 charactersGatorBeerNerd, Mar 24, 2009

Pours a nice amber color. No head but a little lacing.
Smell is awesome. I know this is a fresh one because it smells so great. Lots of pine and citrius and good caramel malt background.
Taste is wonderfull. Very close up there with Pliny the Elder but I still like elder. Still number 3 IPA I have ever had. So good. Lots of awesome hop flavor and bitterness. Great malt balance. Man I can't wait to trade for more of these.
Mouthfeel is a little more viscous than I would like it but I'm just being picky now.
Overall an awesome DIPA that I could drink all night if I found it on tap or could buy it here. 650 charactersPeprSprYoFace, Mar 22, 2009

This beer pours an clear orangy amber with a 1 fingered white head and some lacing. The smell is amazing lots of pine, some nut and lots of malt. The taste is wonderful as well, big piney hops matched with a wonderful malt base, everything is balanced very well. The mouthfeel is nice, the carbonation level seems a little low. A highly drinkable brew for nearly 10% I will have to pick up more the next time I am in the area. 542 charactersBiggness, Mar 21, 2009

4.5 A: Hazy medium orange color. Two fingers of thick creamy white head. Good retention, leaves lots of lacing.
4.0 S: Floral and citrus hops mainly. Orange stands out. Some caramel maltiness too. Not a whole hell of a lot of aroma though.
4.5 T: Very complex set of citrus and hop sensations. A variety of fruits: grapefruit, orange, perhaps a bit of lemon too. Not overly bitter, hops are showcased instead in the flavor. Malts add a balancing bit of sweetness, but honestly who gives a crap about malts in a hopbomb. 
4.5 M: Medium body. Not heavy at all, but still doubly creamy and very smooth.
5.0 D: Very good obviously. No flaws, but not perfection either. 709 charactersDavoleBomb, Mar 14, 2009
4.92/5  rDev +12.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 522 oz. into a snifter/ no freshness date
P: Light gold from the bottle, deep copper with orange highlights in the glass. The head is one finger tall, off-white, and is comprised of small, tightly packed bubbles that sink to form a thin cap on top.
A: One of the best hop-explosive noses around! So citrusy and tropical with aromas that remind me of grapefruits, oranges, peaches, and melons. Just great!
T: Very tropical on the tongue! Sweet, toasted sugar cookie malt does just enough to support the incredible hop bill in this one. The hops just explode onto the scene and unleash an unbridled brilliance that is matched by very few. They're bright & fresh, vibrant & leafy, coating the taste buds but never frying them. Flavors are of grapefruit pith, clementines, peaches, melons, and pineapples, while caramel lays underneath for a nice added sweetness. The alcohol is completely hidden away from the taste receptors. This is absolutely fantastic!
M & D: Dreadnaught is full-bodied, thick, creamy, luscious, and smooth as can be. Drinkability is great! I could drink this all night long, or until I couldn't stand upright anymore!
Notes: This is one extremely flavorful hop-tastic DIPA with plenty of power to spare! An instant classic, immediately vaulting to the top of the my favorites list. One of the brightest shining stars in an endless galaxy of Double IPA's. Highly recommended is an understatement! I beg of you Three Floyd's, distribute this to the West Coast immediately!!! 1,495 characterssweetbrew82, Mar 14, 2009
4.52/5  rDev +3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a bottle into an imperial pint.
Pours a brilliant medium straw with a smallish head that although not enormous, doesn't fade immediately.
Aroma is of floral, sweet and fruity hops. Hop aroma is muddled with estery weiss yeast like aromas. Banana and bubble gum with a hint of orange. Hops turn to pungent as you inhale and the bitter characteristics come through. Malt backbone shows but is somewhat muted by the hop aroma.
Flavor is immediate floral, fruity hops. Fresh grapefruit and orange zest with a malt backing that almost balances. Middle is chewy malt with a estery phenolic alcohol bite. Malt is sweet and very nicely placed in the beer. Buttery and doughy with butterscotch and caramel flavors. Finishes dry despite the sweetness of the malt as the hops come through in the end to stab your tongue.
Mouthfeel is medium to thick. Mosty oily although the dryness the hops impart give a bit of a rough edge. Drinkability is dangerously good for something with this ABV.
Very nice IPA, I would buy it again. 1,031 characterswheatyweiss, Mar 13, 2009
4.82/5  rDev +9.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I had the honor of tasting two different releases of Dreadnaught, and this tasting was a major event in my brew-education (not quite as brutal a lesson as the night I discovered that 5 green flashes after several other beers on an empty stomach may in fact cause sever hangover-like symptoms...respect beer indeed!).
Anyway, what an astonishing difference a mere 6 months makes! (I tried the just-released and prior release).
Appearance: New was perfectly clear, with a brown amber color (similar to Nugget Nectar), the not-as-new was somewhat cloudy.
Smell: The new one reeked of fresh cat urine (in a good way!), the until-recently-newest had much more of a burnt-sugar aroma...more like an amber
Taste: Hey, you know what, they are both delicious, just not remotely similar!! The new release is bursting with hops that edge to creaminess before settling into a wonderfully long bitter hops finish. The new-but-not-as-new-as-the-newest release had a much more distinct honey and butterscotch flavor...pleasant but much sweeter.
Feel and drinkability. They both were just fine, thank you very much. 
In the final analysis, while the newly-not-new was a fine beer, the NEW release was a friggin' treat!!! 1,210 charactersGrandwazoo, Mar 13, 2009
4.52/5  rDev +3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a bomber into a pint glass. It pours a nice copper color. A 1/2 inch off-white head forms and quickly reduces to a thin lacing. No sediment and minimal visible carbonation.
The aroma is a nice mix of citrus fruits (primarily grapefruit) and pine. There is a slight spiciness to the nose and alcohol is hidden. A certain malty sweetness is also present.
The taste is similar to the aroma with some additions. The pine and grapefruit from the hops are present but there is also an earthy, almost moss-like component and mild maltiness.
The mouthfeel is fantastic. There is a great level of carbonation that highlights the flavor. It is not too dry and leaves a nice spicy feeling initially and a pleasant sensation at the finish and a medium body overall.
Overall, this is a very good beer. The alcohol is very well hidden to me and the flavors are well managed. Given the strength, it is important to watch how much you drink though. I will certainly keep my eyes open for this in the future. 1,007 charactersSykDoc, Mar 12, 2009
4.38/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a brownish copper color with very thin white head into a Courtyard by Marriott plastic, waxy white hotel guest cup. 
Malty sweet aroma. Don't pick up significant hop aroma. The malt may balance it out. 
First couple of sips have a big, well-balanced flavor to them. I'm not sure if the sweetness and body comes entirely from the malt or if massive late hop additions factor in to the flavor and mouthfeel. In either case, I like it. 
Delicate lacing on the top ridges of the plastic hotel cup. Thin, cheap walls of the cup allows the beer to warm to the appropriate temperature effortlessly with the grasp of my hand. 
I may have recently lost my sense of bitterness. I'm not picking it up on this one. Very smooth which is fine in my book. A slight belch 1/4 of the way through produces a wonderful hop flavor. 821 charactersYetiman420, Mar 12, 2009
4.42/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Big thanks to Masterski for providing this in a recent trade. Alex is an excellent trader and a man of his word.
Poured with about a finger of head that faded fairly quickly. Some sticky lacing clung to the inside of the glass. The beer itself was a very bright golden amber color with excellent clarity. It was interesting how bright the beer was. 
Big/Fresh aroma that was a smack of Citrus at first then trailed off to some other layered scents. There was a hint of some slight alcohol. I was getting some nice fruits in the aroma. Nothing I could pull out specifically. At this point I sometimes not "tropical" as they seem to be a bit sweeter in nature.
The flavor was big, bold and wonderful. Smooth cracker malt, honey and a big smack of grapefruit hops. Some of those same tropical fruits were present in the flavor and towards the end you got a sense of some resin sticky pine flavors. The slightest warming from the alcohol, but it plays behind the hops and you almost don't notice it.
Just shy of sticky, but also a bright mouth feel with the proper amount of carbonation to lighten the load. Medium bodied.
Very Drinkable and a wonderful DPA.
** This is one to drink fresh. We did a comparison with a fresh bottle and one with a bit of age on it. (maybe 6 months) Two totally different beers. The older beer was much more ripe pineapple and malt based. The fresh one just screamed fresh hops. 1,410 charactersReagan1984, Mar 11, 2009
4.67/5  rDev +6.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Got this in a trade with fogdog. Kevin, you rock!
Decided to share this with lynx1245. Poured into a Duvel tulip.
Appearance: Densely cloudy, orange-peach skin colored body with small, loose, peachy off-white head on top. The body is really something else - absolutely gorgeous color! For being so loose, the head retains pretty well and leaves nice, crusty lacing on the walls of the glass. "Pretty damn pretty," claims Wiseman Jorge.
Smell: Caramel malt + resiny hops = SMACK! (I don't know, that's just what it said in my notes.) Sweet, candied fruit aromas everywhere - mandarin orange, tangerine, and honeydew melon stand out the most. Moist pine and hop resin abound. Tons of sweetness, but not cloying. Complex and totally mouth-watering.
Taste: Much more bitter than I expected. I haven't been too fond of the other FFF IPA's. Bready yeast starts it off, and bitter, herbal hops and pine finish it. Bitter piney hops and caramel malt throughout. Citrus peeks through briefly in the middle, but is nowhere near as pronounced as it was in the smell. This beer is deliciously balanced!
Mouthfeel: Fairly syrupy and definitely full in body. Large presence of both hops and malt. Carbonation provides for excellent smoothness and a delicate tingle. Mild mouth-numbing and pretty chewy.
Drinkability: This is awesome! The only thing preventing me from drinking more is the fact that I only have one bottle. Citrus comes out more with time. Tastes absolutely delicious, but its a bit heavy. 1,497 charactersThreeWiseMen, Mar 08, 2009

Poured into a big snifter as I was hoping for the scent of grapefruit to give my nose hairs pleasant seizures.
A: Darker than Alpha King, yesum. Better lacing as well, but less carbonation. Nice new shiny bottle.
S: Not as overwhelming as I thought, but full of a good citrus spectrum of hops in addition to sweet malt.
T: Fantastic, if this were Alpha Kings brother it sure be the alpha male. Great pineapple like hop, hops that stick around for the whole taste. Midway this DIPA is mildly acidic and gives way to some caramel like malt. The only thing that lingers is some earthy goodness.
M: Thick and syrupy, love how this guy coats the palate. Definately mild heat from the alcohol, but all very very pleasant.
D: High ABV would limit drinking a lot of these and well the availability of it in Minnesota. 869 charactersMPLS, Mar 07, 2009

A sweet and fruity scent up front with the hop scent coming towards the end. Taste is very balanced...may be the best balance of malt to hops I've ever tasted. A very nice citrus flavor with the sweet malt flavor can't get any better. Overall one of the best Imperials that I've had to date. 431 charactershophead247, Mar 06, 2009

4.32/5  rDev -1.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.522 oz. (older label?) courtesy of macdomer into a Mason jar. Great extra - thanks Ian!
Pours a copper-honey, quintessential IPA color with a smidge of haze. Small wisps of carbonation rise to the faint remains of a slightly buttery-eggshell-colored 1/2 finger head. Slight lemon hue shines through the translucence of this deal.
Almost perfect balance of abundant floral hoppiness and a mild yet prevalent caramel malt backbone. Sweetness exudes a faint alcohol burn. Citrus hops emerge with the warmth.
This is less of a hop bomb than I expected and that's by no means a bad thing...everyone needs a little balance in abundance once in a while. Sure, there are a lot of floral, mildly citrus and a bit grassy hops in here with a little twang of grapefruit rind but the malt keeps this more old-school. It provides a viscous husky backbone with a slight butterscotch/caramel sweetness...and a mild...very mild...alcohol burn.
I got no beef with the palate on this - there's perfect balance between silky hop oils and the natural caramel malt texture. Finish is long, clean...a little viscous and alcoholic...and velvety. "I'm needy...I'm inadequate...I got it all, baby!"
The only reason I haven't powered this down is because I'm too busy writing of its many virtues. Carbonation gives this enhancement to the citrus notes and extra brightness. A little more classic English notion than today's hop bombs but to say the least, this is well-crafted and quite enjoyable. 1,474 charactersIBUnit63, Mar 01, 2009

3.88/5  rDev -11.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5This beer is definitely one to admire: a very pretty copper orange; the head wasn't quite as full as I had pictured, but it stuck around for a while and left some incredible lacing down the sides of the glass. The smell was similar to that of other DIPAs: fruity, piney, wonderful... no other style can compete for my nose's admiration. The taste was... a bit like most other IPAs -- which is to say wonderful, but this one was a bit underwhelming for what I had looked forward to. Perhaps it was what everyone had built it up to be, but this one didn't strike me as any more challenging or enjoyable than Stone's run-of-the-mill IPAs or equally hoppy Southern California IPAs. Still, a very enjoyable brew. The 9.5% a.b.v. snuck up more than I had expected it to. 764 charactersIntelligentsia, Feb 26, 2009
4.5/5  rDev +2.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Grabbed a new bottle hot of the line - they seem to have updated the label. Served in my Kuhnhenn tulip glass.
A - One finger of creamy off-white foam with solid retention and terrific lacing - just wish there was a bit more volume. The beer itself is the color of filtered apple juice - a delightful transparent bronze, with streams of tiny bubbles lazily rising to the top.
S - Fresh hoppy goodness - tons of pine, tropical citrus, pineapple, and mango. Good balance, with a fair amount of caramel malt as well. This is the first IPA/DIPA that has really jumped out at me since Pliny the Younger.
T - Strong hop bitterness at the top of the palate, with more sweet tropical notes at the onset. The malt is more understated in the taste, but it's still there. The citrus has more of a tangy grapefruit & lemon zestiness and less of the sweet tangerine flavors found in the smell.
M - Medium body, nice carbonation tingle on the top of the lip, but not bloaty in the finish. Lots of hoppy resin sticks around after swallowing. A touch of alcohol warmth in the finish.
D - This is going down dangerously fast - but it's not quite as quaffable as PtY. There's a tiniest hint of carbonation bloat, and while well hidden the alcohol is hovering at the fringes.
This is a LOT less bitter than I remember - perhaps they've refined the recipe? I have a feeling I'll drinking plenty of this in the near future. 1,408 charactersMasterSki, Feb 25, 2009

A: Lookin' good! Nice deep orange color with a couple fingers of head that leave nice lacing. When I first began pouring, I didn't think there would be much head but it developed very nicely.
S: Pine from the hops hits your nose first, followed by a nice citrusy smell, mostly pineapple and grapefruit.
T: Very nice... tastes just like it smells. Strong but not overpowering pine with the citrus hitting at the end. I'm still learning to taste the malt in my beers and can't comment. The bitterness from the hops hits just right with only the slightest hint of sweetness. The higher alcohol is well masked by the hops.
M: Medium bodied, Leaves the hoppy taste in your mouth that you know you love. Carbonation seems spot on.
D: A bit on the heavy side, it might be a bit hard to down a second bomber, but you know you want it. 871 characterssacullen, Feb 24, 2009

Very nice pine citrus aroma, and a good sweet backbone in the back end of the nose. Taste follows the nose. Mostly piney hops, but plenty of citrus mixed in, lots of tropical fruits, some grapefruit and orange peel. The malt is there, but the hops are the main player in this one. Thick, juicy, delicious. An excellent DIPA. Leaves the tongue numb by the end of the bomber and that will conclude this evening's tastings. 493 charactersKeefD, Feb 23, 2009

Pours a very hazy burnt orange color. A foamy 2 finger head lingered for some time. It is definitely a different looking beer than i expected. The smell is an overwhelming hops punch, with some sweet citrus and pine hints in the far background. Taste follows through on the promise of the smell, as this is a very hoppy ale. There is a far greater sweet malt backbone that helps balance out all those hops. This makes for a unique, and good, sweet/bitter mix. I really like the taste. The brew itself is a little thick for the style, and therefore slightly less drinkable than a number of other DIPAs. Still a great brew. 717 charactersbhalter8, Feb 22, 2009

Smell: Strong hop smell, pineapple, and piney, small malt sweetness
Taste: Big piney hops up front, some caramel backbone, followed by a pineapple hoppy character, and finishing off with a bitterness from the hops. 
Mouthfeel: Some tingle on the tongue from the hops, medium body and leaves mouth with a sweetness. Small tingle from the alcohol down the throat and on the tongue. 
Overall: Fairly easy to drink for a DIPA, flavors are good and balanced. Alcohol is not overpowering. 660 charactersnatasharai, Feb 22, 2009

What a great Valentine's Day this was...an afternoon at 3 Floyds followed by a stint at Flossmoor Station. This beauty was served on-tap at the brewpub and served in a 10oz glass. Pour a beautiful golden copper color with little to no head by the time it arrived from my asshole server (all the servers at 3FFF are complete assholes and don't give a shit about you). The aroma was fruity, mainly grapefruit and other citrus along with piney hops. The flavor is amazing and replicates the aroma to a T. A little heavier body and higher alcohol still make the drinkability on this beer amazingly easy. I was very lucky that this was on tap the day I and can't wait to try it again! 700 charactersdeliriumfest, Feb 21, 2009

A: Piney hops first followed by citrus and grapefruit. Some biscuity malt fights througth the floral hops. 
T: Consistent with smell, pine up front. Middle is dominated by a big lemon zest. The biscuity malts that are more noticeable than they were in the smell provide a really nice balance. Grapefruit lingers a bit in the bitter finish. 
M: Medium body. Ample, but balanced carbonation. This beer is smooth but not oily.

appearance: hazy golden orange with a plumy puffy wihte head. Nice lacing
aroma: Big complex nose, the hops really just jump out at you, rose water, grapefruit, perfumy flowers, kind of smells like when you open the top of a batch of hoppy homebrew.
taste: Very big upfront with a fair amount of bitterness as expected and some sweet juicy malt as well although the bitterness wins in landslide. This beer seems to be bitter on the overall with a less than desirable amount of malt to balance it. 
Overall: Tasty brew, this is the second i drank and the first tasted much more sweet than i expected as though it had aged, im not sure if they were from two different bottlings as there are no marking on FFF's bottles, but regardless a tasty brew. It feels like a beer that must be had on draught to be properly experienced. Live up to the hype? i will let you decide that on your own 1,013 charactersYankChef, Feb 16, 2009

Appearance looks typical for the style, nice orange/yellow with some nice sticky lacing.
Smell is fantastic with a huge hoppy nose; piney, citrusy, with some delicious melon. I really want to know what hops are used in this beer.
Taste seals the deal for this bad mother. Nice malty sweetness initially with an explosion of hoppy goodness. Mango, peach, pine, grapefuit, tons of stuff going on here. The variety/combo of hops in this beer make it really stand out to me. It's not the typical PNW hop combo, there's something a little different in the mix.
Nice smooth mouthfeel, slides right down the pipe!
I would love to drink this stuff all night but alas, I would be trashed.

Taste: Exactly like the nose.

4.42/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Finally was able to score a bottle of Dreadnaught through a trade. The brew pours a dark orange amber with a humongous, foamy, off-white head. Honey-caramel sweet aroma with some dried apricot. Grassy/pine/citrus hops aroma. Light-medium bodied brew with a slightly slick texture. The beer starts off with a juicy fruit flavor with flavors of honey and apricots. Juicy hops flavors, citrus, grassy, herbal. The sweetness is then balanced by a palate-shattering bitterness as the beer finishes with an aggressive, earthy-pine, bitter dryness. I'm guessing Amarillo and Chinook hops might be used in here somewhere. This beer is very good, very complex as it's initial sweetness and bitter finish are polar opposites. Extreme bitterness slows the tempo on this one and the ABV is felt half way through the 22 oz. bottle. I'm glad to have had the chance to try this one.
Cheers! 876 charactersSteveO1231, Feb 08, 2009

4.72/5  rDev +7.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4.5I love this beer and I drink it on a regular basis on tap at the brewpub and out of the bottle. This makes it very hard for me to give an accurate review... but I must try.
I've seen this beer come out cloudy on some pours and clear on some pours... I've even seen it pour cloudy and then clear up??? I assume it's from where the keg/bottle has been filled from the holding vessel. Regardless of haziness, the beer has a beautiful orange meets graveyard western sky color, nice white head, not too big. I love to look at the clear pour of this beer as it can be as smooth as glass.
Huge citrus and pine scent up front. It's as if Mr. Coniferous and Ms. Tangerine ran into each other and suddenly melted on under the hot Chicago sun (in July/August). Lying underneath them would be high quality 2-row malt that is scooping them up. Next to Hopslam this is one of my favorite smelling beers.
Over and over again this beer collapses my palate with piney and citrusy hops. It never gets old. Love it! Amazingly I never taste the bite of alcohol. Maybe it's just me???
If this beer were a few ABV % less I would be drinking it non-stop. 
It's simply and IIPA fan's IIPA. 1,170 charactersRockerD, Feb 05, 2009

4.45/5  rDev +1.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Genuine amber with a white head that settles to a ring in a jiffy. Given the style, you know you're gonna be balls to the walls with lacing.
The smell is massive, piney hops. There's a spruce tree in my glass of beer, and it smells fucking great. But you also pick up traces of caramel malts. They know whose show this is, though. Don't you be trying to upstage the hops, bitch.
Just like with the smell, the caramel maltiness knows its damn role and makes itself minimal. The hops are the ones putting the asses in the seats, and they -- of course -- dominate the palate. They're huge and piney and they answer to no man. Flavor is among the best IIPAs I've had.
Mouthfeel is right where you want it. Solid carbonation and a nice full body. Dry as a goddamn bone on the finish.
Drinkablitly is tip-top when you consider the style. However, I've gotta knock off points given the price of this monster. $9.99 for a bomber? C'mon, man. I can get two bottles of Ruination for that. I love what Three Floyd's does, but I think they could stand to offer their beers at a lower price, especially within the state in which it's made. 1,130 charactersBigJim5021, Feb 01, 2009
4.47/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Appearance: Slightly hazy amber color with thin white head that quickly fades to pond scum (and I mean that in the best way). There is carbonation rising up from the bottom of the glass. There is nice, intricate lacing left on my glass.
Aroma: The aroma is pine first, but also a lot of citrus, mostly grapefruit. There is also more biscuity malt than I feel is typical in DIPA. 
Mouthfeel: Intense small bubbles stir things up inside your mouth. It is medium-bodied and there is a slipperiness, but not necessarily oily.
Taste: Surprisingly mild. The pine leads the way. My favorite IPAs favor the pine-y flavors over the citrus, but this one does have a healthy dose of citrus. The strong biscuity malt balances this nicely revealing a tremendously complex flavor. The finish is pure grapefruit and I don't notice the alcohol until it hits my belly. 
Overall Impressions: Definitely a good one that plays to my favorites. There is a lot going on here! Despite the heavy dose of hops, the malt balance allows the flavor complexity to shine through. I would LOVE to have this on draft at some point. 1,103 charactersjkendrick, Jan 29, 2009

Appearance: Golden amber with orange glow. Nice off white head with some lacing on the glass
Flavor: Pleasant hop bitterness with mild maltiness. The maltiness was there, but it did not offset or balance the hoppyness.
Mouth feel: Medium-light body, mild carbonations
Overall Impression: I would like to have a more balanced approach with malt flavor, have the alcohol aroma decreased and a stronger hop present in the aroma. As I approach the end on the bomber it becomes more drinkable. I would not want to drink more than one bomber in sitting. 706 charactersBirmingham, Jan 24, 2009
4.25/5  rDev -3.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Appearance - Certainly passes the eyeball test. Almost a deep orange with some gold highlights shining through. Head is a very gentle layer of off whiteness, that fades into a white ring with tiny retreating trails of lace.
Smell - They were definitely heavy handed with the hops in this one. Piney hops just float all around the aroma, and are mixed in with a grapefruit, and lemon citrus smell. There's also a little sweetness behind everything.
Taste & Mouthfeel - Smooth piney bitter hops do not crush the palate, but sort of glide over the toungue. Once again there is a honey sweetness behind the hops. It's amazing that there is this much hops yet it's not overly biting or bitter. Mouthfeel is very firm and coating.
Drinkability - A like this beer, I just don't love it. I like my DIPA's with more of a west coast touch. Port and Russian River are more my style. 874 charactersryrust5301, Jan 22, 2009

The nose is perfect hop deliciousness. Nice pine and citrus hops with a slight twinge of malt at the end. The taste is not quite what you would expect from the nose. The bitter hops are the forfront of the berr mixed in with some slight malts. I was expecting to have a bit more sweet taste then bitter. It's very interesting but not what the smell leads you to. The mouthfeel is low carbonation and a slight oily feel down the throat. Overall this is a great dipa. Its on par with some of three floyds best beers.

Pours a deep orange/amber color with a thock & fluffy 2 finger deep off white head. Loads of sticky webbing & soapy lace left on glass. Sticky.
The aroma is massive explosion of all things hops. Awesome. Fruity, piney, grassy, flowery, earthy hops. Plenty of lemon/lime zest, tropical aromas. Yeah. Malt aromas? Dunno. Maybe.
Wonderful hoppy taste as well. Not as bitter as I expected, but big & hoppy. The tropical flavors dominate for me. Juicy, oily, resiny, citric hoppiness. Enough of a sweet malty character to balance things out. Tasty indeed. 
Thick, chewy, medium to full, low carbonation on the bottles I've had. Just enough though that's not a distraction. 
A wonderfully crafted flavorful brew. The hop profile is huge. But this was quite drinkable. Find some of this one. 825 charactersbbothen, Jan 21, 2009

smell- a good hop profile gets you up front lots of citrus grapefruit and orange zest. a good caramel malt backing also.
taste- same as the nose but with some good pine from the hops also.
mouthfeel- thick and syrupy with good carbonation and a sticky finish.
drinkability- another great beer from fff's will seek this one out again. 418 charactersseanpachefddfa, Jan 19, 2009

A: Frothy head that is absolutely gorgeous and white like cloud 9 or some wacky snap like that. the beer is a hazy red oak color that is really pleasant, not too dark but not light enough to look weak and wimpy
S: there is a sharp hop aroma that is evident and delicious it portends a beer that is going to be full of delicious hop taste. there is a slight floral spice in the nose that is a little weak but helps set your head before you take your first sip
T: hop heaven, there are a lot of 2ipas and this is top tier for sure. the hop character is very good. there is a slight sweetness in harmony with a hop bitterness that doesn't linger on your palate but that caresses your senses into a tizzy. there is a slight spice that helps kink the sensation i almost sense a tad of a doughy bread like chewiness that helps hold and pull the body into the taste. there is a slight citrus acidity involved as well, very tasty brew
hype lives to the name, this is a really good delicious overly drinkable beer
buy some drink it delicious 1,103 charactersRedwood21, Jan 18, 2009
4.44/5  rDev +1.1%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I just got this in a trade, really nice to come home to a bunch of east coast beer I cannot get on the west coast. 
The bottle is pretty neat with a regular paper label on a 22oz. bomber. 
The pour of this beer is fun. It comes out really aromatic, and pours a really white head. This is incredibly fresh, and the smell is so so strong. It smells like incredible citrus hops. I have never had a Three Floyds brew and the hops they use smell amazing. Really floral, if that makes any sense, like a bouquet of different hops. 
The taste is so good. Really good, tastes just like a stronger pale ale with a mellow sweetness that is really evident after the first drink. I feel like it is not strong enough, or at least not as strong as I thought it was going to be. Either way, great first taste and a lingering bitterness that tastes great on my tongue. 
The thing I really think people love about this beer, other than the taste, is the drinkability and the mouthfeel. I could pound a few of these, which would be fun considering they are like 9ABV. The positives about this beer are that it tastes good and is really easy to drink without ANY alcohol taste. Negatives are the golden color and that the hop flavor is mild, not wild. I would love to buy this beer again, and if I could I would, but I can't.

4.35/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Pours a medium orange-amber color and clear. Nice 3cm white head.
The citrus is better described as lemon and oranges than grapefruit. Not orange peels, like some hopped beers, but oranges. Malt sweetness.
Very nice orangy sweet flavor. Not overly bitter, and the bitterness on the finish is carried and accompanied well by the sweetness.
Thick, creamy, and smooth without being chewy. Medium bodied, and not dry. Not as clean or dry as I prefer in a big IPA.
Very much a sipper. Mouthfeel slows you down. ABV not as well hidden as Founders Double Trouble or Bell's Hopslam. Not a refreshing thirst quencher.
The Dreadnaught is right on par with the excellence of Bell's Hopslam. An excellent beer which actually serves to show one of the ways that Hopslam is so excellent - the light honey sweetness rather than the heaver malt sweetness. Definitely among my favorite big IPAs. Though, in reality, this is no more available to me than is Pliny the Elder. 960 charactersjpiper, Jan 13, 2009
3.8/5  rDev -13.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Pours an amber color with a 2-finger, cream colored head, that recedes to a thick layer with moderate lacing.
Pick up a lot of citrus notes and resinous pine on the nose, deliciously hoppy up front but I am also pleasantly surprised by a very nice caramelized background that really helps put the hops in it's place.
An earthy hop presence hits you up front and pretty much hangs on all the way through subdued only slightly by a sweet toffee, almost buttery flavor. Now that I am more experienced I realize that what I'm tasting is Diacetyl which I would think a brewery like FFF's would be able to produce a relatively flawless beer.
Medium bodied with light carbonation. The texture on this is very nice and creamy but it feels like I ate a big wad of salted butter caramel. A flawed DIPA, that kinda disappoints. 819 charactersSoneast, Jan 11, 2009
4.56/5  rDev +3.9%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to Tattorso for this!
Pours orange amber with a thin head that descends to a swirl. Little lacing is left.
The smell is of citrus, pine, caramel/toffee. A hop-head's delight, with a firm, tasty malt backing. I love the smell of this one!
The taste is leafy, green hops - citrus, pine, tropical fruits. It is bitter with a rounding sweetness. Finishes a bit sticky.
It has a chewy, full body.
This is an awesome DIPA! For the style/abv, it's just about as drinkable as it comes. Keeps up the hop bitterness while being rounded by a balancing sweetness. Delicious, to say the least! 592 charactersjwc215, Jan 11, 2009

Poured an orange color, mostly clear with a few floaties here and there, no head. Smells of orange peel and citrus right off the bat. Major hops but not overwhelming at all. Super smooth brew, goes down very easy. Sipped on this bomber for about an hour. Even as the beer warmed it was very tasty. Gave me a nice buzz for sure. I would love to crack open a 2nd but its all I have for now. I would buy this beer all the time if it were available in philly. I will keep trading for it in the meantime. Great beer and I enjoy it every time I get the chance to try it. Recommended to fellow hopheads. 808 charactersgibby, Jan 11, 2009

A. Really disappointed with the lack of head from pour, it looks great but this kinda screws it. Beautiful glowing ruby orange with significant haze that really ties it all together. 
S. Really creamy some vanilla, tangerine, slight grapefruit, slight lemon, good use of orange and great smoothed out hop presence. 
T. Just smooth and soft all the way through, mouth feel similar to that of a belgian, hops are definitely but no real hop kick, its somewhat subdued. Mostly sweet orange peel that turns out well, lots of caramel. Reminds me of nearly of barley wine 739 charactersCoolJosh, Jan 04, 2009

A: Pours a hazy dark copper with very mild carbonation creeping up the glass. Pours with a nice, incredibly sticky eggshell white head.
S: The smell is incredibly intense. Almost like a barleywine on hop steroids. Not sure if this was due to a couple months in the cellar or not, but the malt presense was incredibly present.
T: Wow, a real kicker in the face with flavor. Tons of sweet caramel malts blended with a touch of alcohol and a slight hop presense. The hops are by no means bitter, but they balance out the beer nicely.
Overall, this was a very solid beer that I would like to try really fresh. 690 characterstreyrab, Jan 03, 2009
4.58/5  rDev +4.3%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5A light copper bubbly ale with a mass of white fluffy foam for a head. Bubbles are big and brisk but unable to strike down that head. The beer is flawlessly clear. The head sticks and clings to the glass as you drink. A beautiful aromatic blend of citrus and pine hops aroma with just the slightest hint of sticky resinous hops. Malt sweetness is palpable but subdued compared to the hops aroma. Could use a touch more vibrant citrus aroma to put it a bit more over the top and earn the 5 for smell. The creamy rich caramel malts combine with a bread crust heartiness to prepare the palate for the bitterness to come. The hops flavors are bold and crisp and cling to the palate as the beer passes to the stomach. The bitterness slowly fades but is never excessive or harsh. A citrus hops flavor remains on the lips once the bitterness has subsided. Would be perfect if there was just a hint of hops flavor up front to accompany the malt. Medium to Heavy body. Carbonation is enough to buoy the head and eject the hops' aromatics into the air but not too much to be gassy. Rich creamy and superb. This is an absolute must for all hop heads. 1,139 charactersBWH3, Dec 31, 2008
4.12/5  rDev -6.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5Shared a 22oz with my brother in law on Christmas Eve. 
A gorgeous orange beer with a small head that rapidly dissipates to nothing. The smell is fantastic, one of the better smelling beers out there, citrus fruits, pine forests. Not as hoppy on the taste as you would expect, in fact it is mostly sweet on the taste. It's good, but I couldn't drink a lot of it because of the sweetness and am glad I shared this one. 
This particular bottle was a little better balanced then some other samples of Dreadnaught I have had. In fact, it was a lot beter, some have been extremely sweet and that includes straight from the tap at the brewery.
I am a 3F's fanboy to the extreme, they walk on water as far as I am concerned. That being said, I think Gumballhead and Alpha King are superior efforts to this one. They are extremely consistent brews, this one seems to bounce around a little. It's not a bad beer, I just feel like your experience is going to vary based on the particular batch you have. The review bottle was borderline excellent, I've had other samples that didn't live up to that level. 1,095 charactersSwiftyMcBeer, Dec 26, 2008

A: Looked clearer than the bottle. Amber was more golden. It had the same great head - a slightly yellowish, fine one finger. Lacing is never as impressive in a small glass. Handsome looking brew.
S: Has a good solid caramel backbone but the hops were out of control. Awesome grapefruit and floral that was incredibly fresh.
T: Amazing. It was everything that I am used to in the bottle but turned up to 11. Nice sweetness to the malt, honey, massive grapefruit and some floral hops and a piney bite of an aftertaste. So fresh, I was smacking my lips.
M: Bigger, rounder and more syrupy mouthfeel than the bottle. Felt like the high side of medium with just enough carbonation to keep it interesting. Couldn't ask for more.
D: Big beer for sure. Very aggressive but somehow very drinkable. I wish this was lower ABV, so that I could session it. I started to feel a slight buzz off the half pint. Great beer. Really unique taste that is 100% 3F. I want to go back! 1,187 characterssgoodship, Dec 19, 2008
4.27/5  rDev -2.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a nice coppery orange, vigorous pour produces an 1/2" off white head that leaves beautiful lacing, ok head retention.
Hop aroma is the front runner, citrusy, juicy hints of pine resin and herb. Malt follows, somewhat sweet and sugary dough smell.
Hoppy and juicy, big citrus taste. I can taste the centennial, but am not overwhelmed by grapefruit. Slight pine spice and mint. Moderately sweet caramel malt. 
Creamy and moderately carbonated, just the way I like 'em. Some DIPAs are a little undercarbonated for my taste-this hits the nail on the head.
Highly recommended, easy to drink if you know your abv. It's nice to have FFF back in Wisconsin, even if I'd say they generally are $1-2 overpriced they make a great DIPA which are not too plentiful in the midwest. 776 characterseyncognito, Dec 15, 2008
3.92/5  rDev -10.7%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.5Pours a decent copper-orange color with a bit of initial head and a bit of lacing, but not much on either end. Nice scent, good hop characteristics, floral mostly, hints of citrus (but not much), and a very strong maple aroma. Good hop taste, almost over the top, but not for the style, almost a malt balance, with a large maple syrup aftertaste. Goes down fine, a bit thick, but almost no (bad) alcohol taste, nice considering it's almost 10%.
Honestly, I don't see it being one of the top DIPAs, but I also haven't agreed on many of the top rated beers here on BA. 567 charactersJamesS, Dec 15, 2008

The aroma is nice. A nice citrus and pine combo with a bit of caramel sweetness in the background.
The taste is fine. A bit of pine and citrus, with a very light malt presence in the background. Only slightly bitter on the finish, but a decent sweetness throughout. 
Mouthfeel is really pushing full bodied, slightly syrupy, and lightly carbonated.
Drinkability is fairly high. Flavor profile is fine, and overall the beer is enjoyable. The alcohol is very well hidden and makes for a pleasant experience. I am however slightly disappointed with this beer. It's my second go at it, and I thought maybe my first bottle was just pushing some age because it didn't seem quite hoppy enough. Still a solid DIPA, but not my favorite to date. 864 charactersGoliath, Dec 14, 2008
4.47/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Dusty orange in color this beer is one step away from being hazy. The head looks like raw unbleached wool. Nice retention and good lacing. I have to admit that this one looks like a beer I would want to try. But then again what beer doesn't look like that?
The smell reinforces that desire. A thick malt profile is clouded by a hop bouquet that is hard to miss because of it's badass-ness. These hops are big, bold and pushy. Pine resin and grapefruit this beer is going to be a winner.
Taste is a liquid version of the nose. Big hop assault up front with a nice grapefruit taste and a piney loveliness. Followed by a sweet malt that has the legs to run a marathon. The finish goes back to the hop. Prickly and bitter leaving a nice coating of astringent goodness on the sides of your tongue, but there's more. As the bitterness fades the malts come back to reassert their presence. A fantastic volley of flavors.
I feel that a little bit of enamel on my teeth has been stripped off after each sip. I adore that. This is a solid bad mother f-er of a beer. I could drink this until my liver climbs up my throat to kick me in the face. I bet that happens sooner then later because there is almost no evidence of the almost 10% ABV. MMmmm. 1,239 charactersjbphoto88, Dec 13, 2008

4.47/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I've been saving this bottle since our early September visit to Three Floyds. 22 oz, poured in two portions over the course of an hour into a large snifter.
A: Stunning color, a rich and warm copper orange - seems to glow. Modest head, less than a finger of creamy whiteness. It drops in seconds to a clinging collar and a scattered film. Carbonation varies - smaller streams of the tiniest bubbles trickle upwards at the edges, occasional large bubbles erupt from the base and streak to the surface. A few flecks floating in an otherwise clear liquid, testament to 3 months incarceration at the back of the fridge.
S: Aromatic pine resin and sweet citrus mash-up, with a minty twist. Malts are sugar-sweet caramel and herbed dough. An ambrosial fragrance that wafts in waves from the glass. Loved this one fresh at the brewery, love it from the bottle.
T: Sappy evergreen, juicy (but slightly pithy) orange and grapefruit, sweet caramel. All the best flavors you'd anticipate in a big IPA, with subtler influences: grass, (pepper?)mint, grapeskin, hints of melon. Has it's sweeter moments, but an evolving bittering keeps nudging it away.
M: Oily and coating feel, medium-full body, 'luscious'. Some warming and drawing inward of the cheeks. Light, tingly carbonation. Bittering tends to last longer with warming, a little odd since usually malt sweetness seems to grow with time.
D: As boldly-flavored, yet well-balanced an IIPA as you'd hope to find. Enjoyed from the tap (fresh) and from the bottle nearly equally. Deserving of its lofty reputation and one I'd make the hour-long drive out of downtown Chicago for anytime. Highly recommended. 1,651 charactersmsubulldog25, Dec 04, 2008

S_A hugely potent hop aroma eminates from the bottle as soon as it is opened. This continues to pour forth from the glass as citric and pine hops dominate but do contend with some caramelised malt.
T_What starts out as pure hop juice shifts quickly to a good malt base of caramel and a vague bit of tropical fruit. Rounds out again with the huge hops in the aftertaste as well as some cocoa powder. The aftertaste is dry though despite the significant sweetness in the middle as the hop oils seem to coat the mouth. The middle sweetness really evens everything out. While the alcohol is well hidden, there is a nice warming sensation for a cold night.
M_Slightly viscous and oily with a lower than average carbonation. Ends up being a bit sticky.
D_Surprisngly well rounded, the Dreadnaught is more than just a hop bomb. This is what a Double IPA should be and ranks up there with the best of them. 1,006 characterssleazo, Dec 03, 2008

T: Similar to smell; sweet, hoppy and slightly citrousy and very slight bitterness, first swig I had and it was like a smack in the face with flavor...a little warming alcohol in there too, but balanced.

Golden-orange color with slight haze, thick cream colored head and a beautiful craggy landscape of lace.
Smells like tropical fruit salad, with plenty of grapefruit, pineapple, and mango. I like these hops. Some malt like fresh sweet bread and honey, too.
Tastes like fresh fruity hops, with plenty of underlying bitterness like pine sap and leaves, with some astringency. Bread and honey. Complex hop flavor and deep biting bitterness linger for a very long time.
Astringent and powdery texture, with some oiliness, and smooth carbonation. A pleasure to drink.

4.32/5  rDev -1.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4First off, I'm just happy to have Three Floyds back in Wisconsin. I won't take you for granted this time baby, I swear! On to it then...
Appearance is a clear, light amber color, with a quiet and reserved thin covering to top it off. I'm assuming the head retention suffers due to the 9.5 abv.
Aroma is strong pineapple, with some light citrus coming through. Mouthwatering and inviting. Almost makes your nose pucker up.
So hoppy, that it seems like I can taste them before it touches my lips. Some sort of static electric hopping device must have been employed. Seriously though, very strong hop presence, fruity as the aroma suggested, but adequately bitter too. Decent enough malt to show itself, but not so much that it strays from the style. Slightly sweet, but only there to balance, the real star here are the hops. Orange initially, but also pineapple, grapefruit, and maybe some other fruits, and just a hint of pine, but it goes no further. And that's alright with me. Delicious!
Medium bodied, and a medium dry finish. Slightly oily, all perfect for the style.
Overall, drinkability is medium for me. As long as the ABV is under 10% abv, I can handle a couple. The only thing holding me back is the $9.49 price tag. It's not that I think it's overpriced, because I think that this is worth it. But it is hard for a working man to come up with that kind of scratch on a regular basis. I will drink this when I want that special treat. And I will look forward to it each and every time. 1,501 charactersdancinwillie, Nov 24, 2008

I've now had something like 15 bombers of this, and it is without a doubt the best dipa that has ever touched my lips. (I haven't been to the Alchemist for almost a year, so Heady Topper will be reviewed again soon). This thing is so well-balanced, not over-hopped and in your face, but absolutely perfect for the american double ipa style.
Original post:
My girlfriend grabbed 3 bombers on a recent trip to Chicago and lugged them back to CT for me. Been wanting to try this stuff for a while, and it was worth the wait and then some..
Appearance is a typical dipa; dark orangish color with a thick, 2-finger head. Lacing is very sticky and full of resin.
Poured into a tulip and drew the incredible floral hop aroma in -- wow. An amazingly full, fresh smell - like wildflowers in spring is the best way I can describe it. Amazing.
The taste, oh the taste... A full-bodied hop rush sums it up. If you like hoppy beers, welcome home, this one is truly incredible. Alcohol is hidden for the most part, but strong taste of grapefruit and flowers is blended just right.
Mouthfeel is fine, not the most outstanding part of the experience for me, but adequate. 
Drinkability hurt only by the abv, but the taste and smell are so good I could probably be coerced into downing 2 bombers in a sitting.
As you can tell by my reviews, I am a huge hop fan, and DIPA's tend to be my favorite beers -- and this is in the top 3 easily. Pliny is great, but this one's better. If you can get it, please do, you won't be disappointed. 1,541 characterschuckd123, Nov 22, 2008

Obtained on recent trip to the brewery.
Pours a crystal clear, bright orange hue with stray bubbles pushing north. A huge, two+ finger, orange infused rocky head hung around forever.
WHAM! Huge candied pineapple, mango, grapefruit, and orange notes attack the nostrils. Big time hops. Very sweet with some pale malt hanging out underneath all of these wonderful hops.
The hops continue their onslaught. Sweet, candied grapefruit and pineapple lead off with big, bitter finish. Not as bitter as it could be, more on the sweet side.
Chewy, medium bodied, perfect carbonation.
On the boozy side, and it slows you down a bit. A sipper. One you will want to take your time with. 717 charactersColForbinBC, Nov 14, 2008

The nose has fresh citrus fruits, bitter floral hops and pine over a bed of sweet candy malts. The taste is a perfect blend of tart citrus, big flowery hops and rich caramel malts. Medium body is delicately carbonated. Crisp and refreshing yet thick and creamy. This is a very well balanced IPA from Three Floyds. Top knotch. 376 charactersrye726, Nov 04, 2008
4.45/5  rDev +1.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Ar - Smells just like a fresh bowl of hops, sweet, grassy, citrus. Pleasant, floral, with an herbal mint leaf quality, but in sum I can't say greatly out of characteristic of many others of same style. (4)
Ap - Initially pours with thin fluffy head that settles to a ring in time. Really rather pale for color with it leaning more towards gold rather than amber. Poured carefully so as to not rouse the yeast so intial pour is relatively clear. (4)
Fl - This is a lot more balance than I anticipated (I was expecting tongue ripping hops, but this is nothing like that at all). Great malt fruit flavor with nice sweetness. Then hop flavors that hold fruit flavors as well (citrus, grapefruit) prior to a moderate, but certainly not overpowering bitterness that holds great length and finishes with a lingering dryness that is actually quite mild (just lengthy). (4.5)
Mf - Really nice body of some substance with closing in on syrup like thickness, but as the carbonation moves in the body lightens. The carbonation is light and fluffy. (4.5)
D - For style this holds pretty darn high levels in this category. If the alcohol is elevated in any way it's hiding effectively (except maybe in effect, but there is no noticeable flavor). Dreadnaught drinks easily and smoothly, with full flavor experience. This is the category that makes this beer standout against other DIPA. (5)
I will say that this is a good beer, and even better than that a very good beer but I still don't think it's worth the price. 1,501 charactersgarymuchow, Oct 31, 2008

Split with several beer buddies. Color is a cloudy orange/gold. Smells and tastes of citrus and heavy on the hops. Grapefruit and and Pineapple stand out. Smell and taste align for a extremely drinkable, fantastic beer.

4.82/5  rDev +9.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured out of a 22 oz. bomber into a snifter.
A- Golden brown are the only words that come to mind. Very little carbonation, and the head that was there dissipated instantaneously.
S- Sweet smell of pineapple, citrus fruits, and hops. Very similar to Pliny the Elder.
T- Heaven. I thought Pliny the Elder was my favorite DIPA of all-time, but this might take the cake in the taste category. I'm not sure if it because of the extreme freshness of this beer, but it was perfect. It is well balanced, with a nice combination of hops, malt, and citrus fruit. Unlike Pliny, the hops were a little stronger, giving it an edge that Pliny did not have.
M- Not much more you can ask for. Lightly carbonated, medium bodied. Perfect.
D- Given that DIPA's are my favorite style of beer, this is as drinkable as they come. I was tempted to open my other bomber as soon as I finished this one.
I would now like to take the time to thank Three Floyds for making this sensational beer. When I opened this bottle I was expecting something a lot different. To my surprise this definitely competes with the best of them. Highly recommended! 1,127 charactersrhinos00, Oct 19, 2008

22oz bomber poured into Urthel tulip glass.
A: Apple juice appearance. Thinnest of all possible white heads. Filmy lacing, spiderweb patches. Signs of sediment point to a bottle conditioned brew.
S: Unique, dominated by citrus but there is plenty else going on. Grapefruit, spiciness, and I get something that is reminiscent from the malts I guess that makes me think of a gingerbread cookie.
T: Malty and hoppy, I was expecting a midwest hopslam type but thats not what I got. It surely held its own in the flavor dept. Piney and sweet- really just an awesome taste.
M: Oily as any IPA/DIPA Ive ever had. Very low carbonation and the oily hops left in my mouth reminded me of the Pliny experience.
D: The bomber was shared but I would have absolutely no problem taking one of these on myself. A must for any hophead. Went unbelieveably well with some soft gorgonzola.
Another fine performance from Three Floyds, looking forward to next trip to Midwest to pack some in the suitcase. 1,138 charactersmarcpal, Oct 18, 2008

 Smell was sweet malt, cardboard and spicy hop.
 Taste had carmel notes, sweet green grapes. Alcohol was a little hidden but present. Low hop bitterness throughout. Diactyl. Sweet bitter finish. Smooth mouthfell. 
 This beer was complicated with alot going on with the malts .Not nearly enough hop presence to call this a IIPA. I think I got a previous cold cellered beer shipped to me in a trade that may have spoiled this one. Maybe old too.
 Art work on bottle was awesome. I would bet this would taste different at the brewery or state, but hey I was glad to get to try it. 689 characterscannabanaceae, Oct 14, 2008

Nose is big, bold grapefruit with a sweet quality behind it. Taste follows nose - floral and piny with a citrus astringency and a lightly lingering bitterness. Mouthfeel falls between light- and medium-bodied with an even level of sparkling effervescence in the background. Incredibly well-balanced and drinkable. I'm not usually a fan of IPAs, but I'm quickly falling in love with the DIPA style. 507 charactersJwale73, Oct 13, 2008

Pours a really nice amber/honey color, very little head to speak of, little spots of lacing on the glass. Big citrus nose, tangerine and grapefruit, lots of gooey caramel. Taste is glorious...massive citrus notes, slightly bitter grapefruit notes, clementine orange, almost a slight mint taste in there somewhere, and all perfectly balanced with the big caramel malt flavors. Mouthfeel is just the slightest bit thin for me, but with some nice stickiness regardless. It's delicious, plain and simple. 549 characterscorey0212, Oct 11, 2008

A: Nice hazy copper color. Not that much head on it though.
S: Definately a weird nose for a DIPA. Almost smells like graham crackers. The hops are there but weird. Really hard to describe what is going on. Citrus is there but it is unlike anything else I have had.
T: I get a weird mix of biscuit malt and hops. I actually like this quite a bit. Lots of sweetness. You really do not get in in your face citrus hops like you do from west coast examples.
M: Sticky which is nice.Little bit thick. Carbonation is low but it works rather well for this beer.
D: Split a bomber and I want more. Totally different DIPA. It is hoppy but it is also super malty. This isn't like the others. Really well done. It does have a homebrew feel to it which I love. 788 charactersaerozeppl, Oct 10, 2008

Served in a snifter
Acquired in a trade with Jeager
The beer poured hazy, glowing, orangey-amber color with a creamy, bubbly, light tan, one-finger head that faded to a thin film. Lots of tiny drops of lacing trickled down the glass.
The aroma was quite hoppy. Citrusy, spicy and semi-sweet, with strong notes of orange zest. Tropical fruits (mango and pineapple) were noticeable as well. As the beer opened up, the malt presence came out more and the aroma turned sweeter and more biscuity. Some alcohol was also detectable.
The taste was super hoppy and zesty. A rich, caramel-like sweetness (and a hint of brown sugar) came through up front before the hops took over. The hops were ultra citrusy in a sweet, candied orange peel sort of way. Spicy in the center. The hugely bitter, lingering finish consisted of a mix of pine, resin, grapefruit rind and a big alcohol kick. As the beer warmed, both the sweet maltiness up front and the intense hoppiness on the back end became more pronounced.
The mouthfeel was medium bodied (a bit thinner than I anticipated). Slightly creamy with a lively carbonation.
Drinkability was good but not great. The brutally bitter finish and the noticeable alcohol presence definitely made this one a sipper.
This was an interesting DIPA which had a flavor profile that changed drastically from start to finish. Although I enjoyed it, I was hoping for a slightly "bigger" beer that had more to offer in the way of flavor complexity and mouthfeel. 1,536 charactersDamian, Sep 28, 2008

Flavor is fully on the earthy side. Touches of caramel. Loads of malt. Theres that muddy earthy thing I really like. I'd say this was really damn good on the flavor, but... Too much noticed alcohol. It doesn't blend enough IMO at first at least. Seem to get used to it eventually though and what's left is a nice earthy, full double ipa. Good carbonation and a nice liquid feel. A really smooth example of the style. Calm the booze down and there's really no need or improvement. 578 charactersRblWthACoz, Sep 27, 2008

Got a bomber of this one in the other day from Archer Liquors. I love the artwork of the 3F bottles, and this one was one I hadn't managed to hold on to before, so I ordered another. Also, it's a great brew!!
I'm gonna up the appearance score a little. I split this one w/ friends before, but now that I have a bottle of my own and can see it in its "natural environment" (a 22 oz. snifter), the head is sticky, foamy, surprisingly fine-bubbled, and uniform. It's a little more bitter than I remember it being, but I've grown more accustomed to that in the year since I've tried it. It's also a little fluffier, more "well-carbonated" than I remember it - though still very even. All in all, still one of the best DIPAs I've ever had. Kudos to 3F.
***
Bottle courtesy of proteus93, split threeways at a tasting - thanks! Poured into a wine glass.
Appearance: A crystal clear golden amber with sparse, medium-bubbled, and mercurial effervescence. A nice, foamy, creamy one-finger head settles atop this beer and has decent staying-power. Lacing is sparse but nice-looking.
Aroma: An incredibly aromatic and wonderfully pungent hop nose on this one. Mint, dill, ruby red grapefruit, orange zest, and tobacco provide the majority of the hop notes, and agitation releases a bunch of great sweet, roasty, bready malt notes. A really fantastic smelling beer.
Taste: It's bitter, but it's also wonderfully sweet. Everything here is just "larger," kicked up a few notches from a wonderfully balanced pale ale. A nice, sweet caramel malt backbone, some nice citrus and herbal hop notes, and - unfortunately - a strange alcohol note, sort of solventy, which is this beer's only taste knock. 
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied but wonderfully milky, creamy, smooth, and soft. Surprisingly thin - not really thin, just thinner than expected, and that's nice.
Drinkability: On par with any (D)IPA that Russian River puts out in the smell department, and pretty damn good everywhere else. I feel that the appearance probably would have been nicer if I'd had my own bottle and poured it properly into my own glass, and there was that strange alcoholy note (which in retrospect, might have just been a strange hop interaction), but by and large, what a fantastic beer. Highly recommended. 2,294 charactersCrellMoset, Sep 24, 2008

I had a Dreadnaught & an Alpha King, one of which I expected to love, one I figured would be OK. Only thing is I got them backwards. 
Pours a distinct, cloudy orange with a touch of sediment swirling about & a very minimal, quick-dissipating head. Smells of hops a bit & a lot more sweet, earthy malt than I expected. Taste the same, with an almost gritty, soily taste with that sweetness coming in at th end. 
Mouthfeel is very flat, almost like a high-ABV balrey- or wheatwine. The heavy malts overpowered the hops & made this somewhat muddled. 
Give the great reviews, & my fondness for this style, I'd like to find this on tap someday & give it another go. But I'll pass on the bottles from here on out. 795 charactersmaximum12, Sep 20, 2008

Aroma had hints of resinous pine, lush citrus fruits, and sweet malts. The carbonation is low to medium & the body is full. The taste is a balanced mouthful of a creamy, malty, sweet finish, along with an unbelievable, intense hoppy flavor and bitterness equaled by the intensity of the richness of full bodied mega malt. This definitely is one of the best IPA's I have to date. I could drink this stuff all night!! 625 charactersygtbsm94, Sep 18, 2008

T - Malty sweetness up front, little bit of caramle flavor coming through. Big hop taste comes through. Bitter taste of citrus fruit. Grapefruit, lemon, and still some peach coming through. Alcohol is present but not overwhelming.

A: Orange/ light amber with a one-finger off-white head. Decent retention, this leaves some lace.
S: I get alphonso mangoes right off the bat with some peachy fruitiness. The mango is ridiculously prominent, though. Not much else going on here.
T: Starts off moderately bitter with some grapefruit bitterness along with the mango and peach that's jumping straight into my face. Moderate malt sweetness comes through with a bitter-sweet finish coming through. The alcohol's noticeable on the finish.
M: On the lighter side of medium bodied with good carbonation and a nice bitter finish but the alcohol heat does detract from this beer.
D: I'm having no problems drinking (and finishing) this beer but at this price, there's other DIPAs I'll be drinking more regularly. This is a nice treat, though
22oz bottle, 3/4ths poured into my 26oz wine glass( Bottle acquired ~ August 07, consumed Feb-Mar 08)
A: Deep caramel-ruby red with an off white frothy head. not much carbonation is apparent (4/5)
S: Surprisingly malty with tons of caramel, toffee and hints of alcohol and mango. The hops are not an assault here (4/5)
T: Barleywine-like rather than IIPA like. The hops are definitely mellowed out here. That said, it's still delicious. It starts out mildly hoppy, takes a turn when the malts come in - there's tons of caramel here. The finish is a little sweet (not cloyingly) and a little hoppy. Not the best for the style but still a very good beer (4/5)

A- Very dark gold/light brown and slightly cloudy. Baseline head with nice hanging lacing. 
S- Malty with hints of hops but nothing overpowering. 
T- Holy Malts - Taste is great. The slight alcohol hits you at the very end, burying the 9.9% ABV. Caramel malt with woody crispness. Not very hoppy. But the malts are very interesting. 
Mouth feel - This is a very silky beer in the front and middle, the hops hit you in the back and the alcohol hits right in deepest trenches of your throat (this dissipates as it warms up). The malt silkiness lingers. Very impressive. 
D - Very Drinkable- The silky smoothness wants you to keep sipping. The taste will allow you to put back a couple of these bombers. But the ABV will catch up to you.

4.27/5  rDev -2.7%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Since today is my birthday I decided to celebrate by cracking open something special. I received this in a trade from bakerslp, and have been very much looking forward to it ever since. I poured the 22oz. bomber into a Duvel tulip glass to get as much nuance as I can from this highly-hyped beer.
A: Beer is hazy and copper-colored with a one-finger head of off-white foam. Thin white lacing clings well to the glass. Nothing overly special here.
S: LOADS of fresh hop resin, some bitter citrus rind, fresh pine smack you in the nose so forcefully it's hard to pick it all out. A faint whiff of alcohol is also noticeable amid a sweet malty base.
T/M: Extremely hoppy, yet very balanced. The sweet, sticky malt base and citrus hops balance out nicely with the bitter piney hops to create a complex, yet easy-to-drink brew. While the hops don't want to seem to quit in this beer, they never become overpowering. Sweetness tends to build over time and borders on being cloying, but helps to balance out the beating the hops could give your palate otherwise. Overall mouthfeel is smooth and buttery, but the lack of carbonation (as evidenced by the quickly fading head) does border on being syrupy.
D/O: This is a very easy beer to drink despite the ABV. A warming alcohol sensation greets your stomach as you reach the bottom of the bottle, but you barely notice it as you're drinking. Overall I really enjoyed how complex and balanced a brew this was, but was hoping for a little bit more in the way of appearance (head, retention, lacing), smell and mouthfeel given the hype. That's not to say that this isn't one of the finest DIPAs available (it is), but there are plenty that I can readily get in PA that I feel are equal or better. 1,739 charactersPhillyduke, Sep 03, 2008

Pours a light hazy amber, with a smallish offwhite head that discipates pretty quickly, but hangs around slightly. 
Smells like a DIPA should...very full and powerful, yet not overpowering. I first get a good whiff of some nice, sweet malts...then the juicy hops come forward in full force. If it tastes half as good as it smells..
The taste is fantastic. I initially pick up the malty goodness, and then the malts step aside for the hops. Very nice not to be overpowered with the initial sip, you have time to savor all the flavor. 
The mouthfeel is great as well. Slightly thick, with some nice sticky hop action. Leaves a very pleasent DIPA aftertaste, anticipating the next sip.
This one is dangerously drinkable for 9.2% It shouldn't be a problem though, as this is one I'm going to savor. I'll definately be picking up as many bombers of this as I can when I head to Chi-town in October. F-ing delicious! 953 charactersPackforever1976, Aug 22, 2008
3.03/5  rDev -31%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 2.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3Dread not. Pour is a mostly cloudy golden color with a slight orange-yellow hue through out. A little help with the pour provided a think soft whit head. Guess it didn't need help. Great retention and lacing through out.
The nose is surprisingly balanced. A sweeter malt aroma comes out with mostly a grainy nose but some minor biscuit and sugary notes as well. The hop aroma is light for a IIPA (IMO) but mostly grapefruit notes and a light piney hop not on the back end.
The taste is more centered on the hop but is not in balance with bitterness and finishing flavors. The hops, to start, have a strong bitterness that lasts into the finish. This is enhanced with some stronger piney hop flavors that leave a bite and enhance the bitterness. The piney comes out just a bit stronger than the grapefruit but both are detectable. The malt is sweet with more of a sugary taste than anything else. Some minor grainy and honey notes but mostly sugar. There are some minor butyric, which is surprising and was a deterrent for me. Some solvent notes as well, but nothing over the top considering the ABV.
The body is moderate with a sweet finish that makes me think underattenuated. There is a high carbonation that enhances the bitterness as well, which is already out of tune.
Overall this beer has a lot of hype and just didn't produce for me. Some off flavors, sugary malt, and I would like to see more finishing hops. 1,421 charactersOxymoron, Aug 20, 2008
3.9/5  rDev -11.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Served cool in a Boston lager glass from a brown bomber.
Hazy orange color with a rocky off-white head.
Aroma is sweet caramel and loaded with grapefruity hops. 
Tastes sweet and malty with plenty of hop flavor, maybe too sweet. Lingering caramel aftertaste like a double red.
Mouthfeel is moderately bitter, could use more of a bite to counter the caramel.
Drinkability is OK, but heavy sweetness in the finish could use some balance from more bitterness or a stronger, more piney hop variety. 499 charactersBattleRoadBrewer, Aug 18, 2008
3.77/5  rDev -14.1%look: 3 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Had this the same day that I had a fresh "Pliny the Elder"; so it may have been a little unfair to judge this beer. Especially since I got it in a trade and may have lost some of it's freshness due to aging.
Appearance: Golden-orange and a little hazy in appearance.
Smell: More fruity then hop aroma...if I had to pinpoint it...I would say citrus.
Taste: Malt sweetness, which was more noticeable then the hops. Overall taste, about average.
Mouthfeel: Moderate to light.
Drinkability: Not the smoothest Imperial IPA I have encountered, but somewhat easy to enjoy.
Overall: I think if I had this on-tap or a fresh bottle of it...my overall judgement of the beer would change. I think its a good beer and one I would order or purchase if I saw it on the shelves. But, you may be a little disappointed just based off the fact that it is so highly regarded on BA. 867 charactersOlieIPA, Aug 16, 2008

S- floral and citrus hops, a little bit of sweetness. not as strong as i would have imagined or liked. 
T- very strong grapefruit hop finish with a perfectly blended and balanced sweet malty start. wow. 
M- medium bodied, crisp, clean, and smooth. first class all the way. 
D- the alcohol presence is non-existent. the flavor is amazing. its so smooth, and downright refreshing. a great example of the style and one ive had time and time again. its really a shame that three floyds isnt distributed on a larger scale because this one is something that all beer lovers and casual drinkers alike would love. 664 charactersjwinship83, Aug 16, 2008

4.92/5  rDev +12.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Sampled on tap at the Map Room and served in a combo of a flute and tulip glass, I don't think there is a name for it here at the moment.
A: Pours a deep and yet pale gold very clean which seems to be different from the bottle which was just a bit cloudier. The beer is topped by a very creamy, very rich one inch head that stay for much of the session but fades into a cap midway through drinking but leaves behind some rather thick and sticky lacing.
S: Absolutely amazing. WOW wow wow factor times ten, just super fresh hops, floral hops are here piny hops are here, ripe grapefruit ripe melon and ripe pineapple are all here, just an absolute pleasure to inhale.
T/MF: Again, tastes almost exactly as it smells super piny super citrusy but also has a decent amount of malty caramel sweetness that really seems to bring this beer together. Waves of melon, pineapple grapefruit orange juice pear mango, just goes all over the tongue and does not relent, mouthfeel is thick, chewy and very sticky leaves tracks of bitterness all across the tongue which after drinking an entire glass of this beer becomes just the slightest bit tiring, but other than that this beer is perfection in a glass.
D: I could drink this beer all night if it werent so bad for me. Really this beer should be illegal because of how good it tastes. 1,327 charactersbluemoonswoon, Aug 14, 2008
4.4/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 522 oz bottle poured into a Duvel tulip. Purchased at Mustard Seed Market in Akron a few months ago. Was told it was from a fresh shipment, we will see...
A: Hazed, deep golden orange color. Thin, bubbly white head hangs around as a thin film and leaves streaks of sticky lace on the inside of the glass. 
S: Super hoppy smell hits you first. Just enjoy that for a while then sort out the strogner piney aromas from the background of citrus. Also a slight sweetness, malty and fruit. 
T: Barrage of hops from the beginning that never lets up and leaves a lingering slightly pungent hop taste. Primarily a piney bitterness, balanced out by surprising sweetness from the malt but more strongly citrus hop flavor. Very well balanced and the alcohol is well hidden behind by the overwhelming hops.
M: Lighter bodied with very strong, active carbonation and tons of bite make this very smooth and almost creamy. Aftertaste is very hop strong, yet slightly sweet, making this very palatable. 
D: A very good DIPA. Although I had my doubts, I would say this was a relatively fresh sample. The booze is well hidden and the bitterness is well balanced making this very drinkable. It's been awhile since I had Pliny, Hopslam, Racer X, etc but I would put this on their level, though I feel like it's just slightly behind them in terms of personal preference (the price of this guy certainly isn't helping). 1,396 charactersyourefragile, Aug 14, 2008
4.69/5  rDev +6.8%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Got this from a trade with Beereality, much obliged.
Pours a slightly cloudy dark gold color with a one finger head. This recedes into a pretty good sized ring around the glass that laces well.
This beer smells great. Lots of floral hop smells, with some bitterness and malt sweetness. This is what Sam Koch wishes he smelled when he crushes those hops on that commercial.
The taste is also very good. Decently bitter with a floral taste (somehow) and pretty sweet. There is no trace of the alcohol.
The mouthfeel is good, the carbonation is just right and it's smooth going down, again, a feat considering the ABV and style.
This beer is obscenely drinkable considering the high ABV. I can't imagine what would make it more drinkable.
Overall this is in the top 3 DIPA's I've ever had. It's not too harsh and the flavors all work in concert with each other. Definitely worth a try. 888 charactersglid02, Aug 01, 2008

S: Fairly intense citrus hoppy aroma. Very nice. No noticeable alcohol on the nose despite it's pretty high ABV.
T: citrus fruit, lots of hops, with a nice malty compliment...nicely balanced. I'm admittedly not an IPA lover, but I think the tides are changing. This is an IIPA that I would gladly drink again!
M: moderate carbonation, very crisp, flavorful, very misleading alcohol presence as it's completely unnoticeable!
D: Yes, I want more. 645 charactersjulian, Jul 30, 2008

S- A nice sweet hoppy smell, sweet grapefruit as well.
T- A nutty hoppy taste with a slight bit of bitterness. If there was a slight bit of dark fruits in the taste this would be a solid barleywine. 
M- Feels good in the mouth.

After the first sip I just get all grapefruit. Bitter and sharp but juicy. This is an easy drinking DIPA but its not as complex as the Alpha King. 266 charactersDrunkenMaster, Jul 17, 2008
4.02/5  rDev -8.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Got a bomber from my mellow my man hopflop as a groomsman gift (this dude is really the man--he gave us bells, three floyds, and the brooklyn brewery brewmaster's book about beer with food). 
Poured into a corsendonk tulip glass. About a solid inch of head and very tactile lacing still graces the glass as I'm sipping. The color is that wonderful amber that looks straight out of Jurassic Park. The cloudy, deep color and the head is picturesque.
The overwhelming scent is that beautiful blend of hops, pine, and citrus that pervades the best imperial IPAs. This one also lingers with a bit of booze.
The taste is everything you want in an imperial IPA. I've had around 4 imperial IPAs, and this one is very assertive. The stickyness isn't as prevalant as, say, the Rogue Imperial IPA in the ceramic bottle. But the booze is really prominent, maybe more than I'd prefer. 
The mouthfeel is that of a wonderful, creamy, thick-yet-refreshingly palatable wonder. This category is executed superbly. 
The drinkability is low because the alcohol is so present. It is making the bomber a pleasure to finish buz-wise, but not necessarily making me crave another. This is a rich beer, so like other ultra-flavorful delectables, this is one to sip and savor. 1,254 charactersjessecarr, Jul 16, 2008

The beer pours a hazy amber orange with a frothy white head that holds a nice film and leaves some beautiful lace. The aroma is full of citrusy and piney hops. Cascade, Centennial, Columbus, Simcoe. I am not sure, but its nice. There is a touch of bready malts in there as well. The taste has a huge sweet malty backbone, but the hops still dominate. The body is medium-full with enough carbonation to bring the hops the the tongue. Overall an amazing DIPA. Give me a bottle of this every day. 565 charactersMSchae1017, Jul 12, 2008
4.44/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Pours a light red color with a slight haze in it. There is a great amount of carbonation that creates a good thick head with a very nice retention.
The smell is unbelieveable on this imperial IPA. Incredibly strong scents come pouring out of this beer. An immediate hint of grapefruit and a lot of other citrus smells after that. 
Great taste to this beer as well. The first taste to this beer is hops. Very nice hops with grapefruit tastes and a citrus lemon bite as well. The end has a slight malt taste to balance it out.
The mouthfeel has a good smoothness to it and a good amount of body for an IPA. 
The drinkability is very nice as well. The slight malt taste balances out the ridiculously strong hop tastes. This beer has such a nice hop taste but it is not overpowering. A very highly recommended selection.
Followed this selection up two days later with a version that has been cellared for a year to see the difference:
Appearance is the same.
Smell has the same nice hops smells, but with much more of a stronger malt. Also, there is a bit of an alcohol smell to it as well.
The malt comes out a lot stronger in the taste on the cellared version. Also, there is a slight alcohol taste at the end.
The beer gains a little smoothness in the mouthfeel too, as the strong bite of the carbonation has been lessened. 
I loved this beer the first time and second time. I can't tell which I like better, the fresh or cellared version, but either way you can't lose with this offering. 1,490 charactersBDIMike, Jul 09, 2008
4.12/5  rDev -6.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured from 22 oz. bomber into a snifter.
Pours a bright orange color with a one finger off-white head that quickly disappears to leave a spotty thin coating on top. Very small amount of lacing.
Aromas of tropical fruit, grapefruit, orange, a little pine, and some caramel malt.
Flavors are first of pine and citrus, a huge burst of bitterness, then upon swallow the tropical fruit and sweet malt emerge alongside a lingering bitterness.
Mouthfeel is pretty much in the medium range, I prefer DIPAs to be a bit more syrupy myself.
Dreadnaught is definitely one of the best DIPAs I've had, but something seems to be lacking. That is not to say it isn't great, just that it could still be better. There are other DIPAs to be had that are as good for half the price. 768 charactersroadhouse, Jul 08, 2008
4.2/5  rDev -4.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4This beer simply screams technical perfection. It is balanced, refreshing, and fun to drink. Why, though, don't I find it more exciting?
Pours coppery, golden and slightly hazy. It smells of delicious crystal malt and tropical fruit. The flavor is citrusy, like sweet grapefruit, with overtones of pineapple and perhaps even a pleasant, slight saltiness. The bitterness is surprisingly subdued for the style, but that crystal malt flavor lingers instead, like taking a deep breath in your favorite homebrew shop. The mouthfeel is solid, but not as viscous as one might expect from a Double IPA.
There is no question that this is an outstanding beer, but there is ever so slightly something missing - it is perhaps too good, too polished. It lacks adventure, perhaps a certain rawness.
And yet, if another one crosses my path, I will drink it with pleasure. 859 charactersSeanibus, Jul 05, 2008

S- Heavy malt presence with citrus hops and biscuit yeast scents. I could smell this beer from 3 feet away.
T- Citrus and pine hops lead the palate followed by roasted malts and a slightly tangy yeast. This beer is extremely well balanced.
M- Exactly what a IIPA should feel like its big heavy and mouth coating. leaves the mouth somewhat dry
D- This is a great IIPA amongst the best that I have tasted. High in alcohol yet well masked. and the hops and malts are well balanced yet both are bold. If it were not for the ABV I would happily session this beer. 653 charactersUA8, Jun 30, 2008

Pours a really clear deep golden/orange with a fluffy white head that really hangs around then laces all the way down. Aroma is hops. Spicy, Piney, Citrus and grapefruit hop goodness. There is a little caramel malt hidden deep underneath as well. The taste is really nice, it isn't as hoppy as the smell would suggest. I taste some caramel from the malt then the grapefruit kind of sneaks in on you. Leaves a citrus twang on the tongue. Well done Imp Ipa, very balanced, very drinkable. 571 charactersjohnnnniee, Jun 26, 2008

S- Super citrusy, floral and piney from the hop profile. The malt backing is there too and blended well with the hops. Usually, IIPA's are either one or the other and overboard. This one, however, is not. 
T- Wow, the same hop characteristics carry over well from the nose and work so well with the malts. At first, it drinks sweet and easy then BOOM! The bittering hop hits you and carrys over well after the beer leaves your mouth. There is a slight alcohol taste but not very noticible. I also taste a honeylike quality too.
M- Medium to thick and medium to low carbonation.
D- Super good brew and great representation of style. I really dig this one. It actually packs as much punch as some of the American Barleywines that I have had and carries the same "sip-ability". 
Overall: Today is my BA birthday and I thought this might be the perfect beer to celebrate with. Great brew! 1,029 charactersMMAJYK, Jun 25, 2008

This one is well blended and I will seek this one out again.
The Head, the lacing, the aroma all are damn close to perfect.

4.82/5  rDev +9.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Dreadnaught is a glowing, sun-kissed orange that ripens to more tawny shades at off angles. Its toasted complexion contains a great deal of natural haze. A khaki tan head did once shield the top; its role is now reduced to merely outlining the beer.
This would be one heck of malt monster if it wasn't so damn hoppy... err, wait, no, I got that backwards, it would be one hell of a hopbomb if it weren't so malty, no wait, ahh ... this is rightfully confusing because the beer nearly overwhelms on both counts all at the same time.
Nostrils and taste buds alike are engulfed with both rich toffeeish malts and vibrant, zesty hops. There is a downpour of sticky, sugary-sweet malts, caramelized to a succulent perfection. A torrent of hops usher in fruity notes of tangerine, mandarin, grapefruit, mango and pineapple. They introduce the enigmatic floral esters and dump on pine, spruce and resin by the bucketful.
Despite the endeavors of both malt and hop, the two have found a consonant, almost rhythmic balance that has the caramel dancing with pine and the spruce pimping orange out on one arm, grapefruit on the other. How many synonyms are there for 'harmonious'? In the brewing world there need be only one: Dreadnaught.
You might think at 9.5% a bomber of this would be enough. No. It is never enough. You grow ever attracted with every look. You grow ever tempted with every sniff. You discover a new, exotic fruit with every sip. And you are more and more amazed every time you finish it.
Dreadnaught is where the ambrosial qualities of hops reach their pinnacle. It should be hung on walls in galleries, read about in textbooks in schools and preached in Sunday sermons. 'It's not normal' is the Three Floyds credo; I sorrowfully wish it were normal, then the world would be a much happier place for beer drinkers. 1,830 charactersbiegaman, Jun 21, 2008

Tastes absurdly alcoholic with an almost overpowering bitter hop taste. This was not one of the more balanced IPA's I've ever had. Even for the being a Double IPA, it was almost too hoppy. Overall, a good DIPA, but the lack of balance keeps it from being truly exceptional. 400 charactersjdubjacket, Jun 17, 2008

You can see the hop oils oozing througout the glass. Very light in color, no haze. Not much head.
Smells like the produce section of a grocery store when all the fruit is ripe. Wait there's more...pine. The malt is there but the star of this show is hops.
Everythihng you smell you taste. Lot's of fruity/piney goodness. There's a good bit of grapefruit at the end. My wife says it taste like gummy bears.
For as big as this beer is the mothfell is very deceiving. It's not thick, or viscous at all.
I can and will dink this beer all day. Some people might claim this beer is off balance because of the HUGE hop profile but they would be missing the point. 779 characterssamriggins, Jun 14, 2008

4.97/5  rDev +13.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I picked this one up a little while back when I was up in Indiana for a wedding. It was a couple of months before I decided the timing was right to enjoy this one. 
I poured it out of a 22oz bomber into my Chimay goblet. It poured a nice head that hung around for a bit. The beer appeared to be light amber in color. The beer had great nose with citrusy aromas. It drank extremely smooth with just a little warmth from the alcohol(suprisingly smooth for how high it was). As far as mouthfeel goes, moderate to low carbonation on a big, thick, almost syrupy offering that felt silky smooth going down. The silky smoothness is very similiar to Stone's Ruination in my opinion. The taste was exceptional. Very smooth, hoppy flavors dominate the beer with a slight sweetness that very much reminds me of my encounter with Bell's Hopslam. 
Overall, an exceptional offering that definately ranks in my top five favorite DIPAs. Next time I am in Indiana I will make sure to stock up. 978 charactersTyBogey, Jun 12, 2008

3.49/5  rDev -20.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 3 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Picked up from the brewery and sent to me about 3 weeks ago. Should be pretty fresh.
A- Clear golden orange. The orange overtone in it is fairly light though. Head is hard to build up but eventually forms a finger worth and drops into a sea-water-like thin bubbly foam.
S- Pine was the first thing to jump out, then orange. The sweet syrupy malt I find in certain DIPA's I don't care for comes through stronger after a bit. A lot of that hop aroma gets overpowered by the malt as you keep sniffing it.
T- It's moderately citrusy with a bit of a juicy finish. Not bad here on the taste. The malty body plays a big role and offers a sweet backbone to it. I like a DIPA that is more hop-forward ala Pure Hoppiness or Ruination, and leaves some of that syrupy maltiness out of the equation.
M- Much better than I would predict from the syrupy malt smell. It approaches a syrupy thickness but doesn't get all the way there which is nice. Still has an abundance of malt sweetness in the taste.
D- This beer just barely approaches the line I draw for when I don't like DIPA's. However it doesn't cross over. It's still nice. I tend to prefer the less syrupy DIPA's like Alpine Pure Hoppiness, Stone Ruination, and Pliny the Elder. This doesn't quite hit their level but it doesn't totally turn me off as others have. 1,314 charactersMiScusi, Jun 01, 2008

Poured the 22 oz. bomber into a snifter.
A: Slightly cloudy honey, copper color. A fine pour leaves a 1/2 a finger of off white head. Thick spotty lacing line the glass.
A: Holy hops batman! Floral and citrus hops explode on the nose. Mango, orange, grapefruit, lemon, and a touch of basil? Off the charts!
T: As the beer warms, the flavor expands. Hops obviously dominate, citrus and honey present as well. The beer finishes with a very nice bitter, alcohol warming.
M: Creamy, medium bodied beer. Some carbonation, and extremely smoooth!
D: This ranks right up there with Hopslam as my favorite DIPA. If I had to call it, it would be HopSlam by a nose, but don't get me wrong, Dreadnaught is top of the line for DIPA's. I have to pace myself, because I only have two of em', but I could drink them both right now!! Outstanding! Skal. 929 charactersGtreid, May 31, 2008

Amber gold color with fluffy white head that fades to a layer of foam for the entirety of the beer. Nice lacing.
Sweet hoppy smell. Mostly pineapple(?) then pine and citrus. Absolutely great nose.
Taste is even better. Bitter and citrus hoppy but also extremely well balanced by malt especially for an IIPA. As it warms I get more tropical fruit tastes but especially pineapple. 
Syrupy and smooth.
Aside from ABV this is just extremely well balanced and drinkable. Highly recommended. 508 charactersthickerfreakness, May 28, 2008
4.77/5  rDev +8.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Three Floyds Dreadnaught Imperial IPA pours up lively with a grandiose, creamish frappé head that mounts the slightly hazy, burnt orange-tawny amber body. Lots of lacing with very good-excellent head retention. The pungent aroma showcases a plethora of resinous hops ranging from floral to fruity (mango, peach, pummelo, tangerine, tropical fruit) to woodsy (evergreen, pine nuts) with some toasted maltiness & alcohol complexity showing through as it warms in hand. The flavor starts off just a touch cloying with a sweet underlying caramel maltiness reminiscent of a bananas foster flambé with a defined toasted (biscuity/soda bread) character that carries into a dominating bitterness that delivers a big, bold, warming finish. This medium-full bodied DIPA is well carbonated and slightly astringent from all those wonderful hops. Three Floyds Dreadnaught is a hop lover's wet dream and should be feared by light beer drinkers!

4.07/5  rDev -7.3%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Purchased at Dark Lord Day 2008.
A- poured into an imperial pint glass. Color is akin to orange blossom honey with a thinly laced head and slight haze from the bottle-conditioned yeast.
S- very citrusy from the massive amounts of hops. slightly biscuity, with an apparently strong malt backbone.
T & M- this is definitely a beer to enjoy when you're in need of a hop fix. Bitterness is constant throughout the beginning, middle, and finish of each sip and lingers on in the aftertaste. There is a good malt backbone present, but the hops totallly dominate it and hide the high alcohol content as well. Slick mouthfeel with perfect level of carbonation.
D & Notes- I found this beer to be pretty darn drinkable, and definitely worth seeking out. It's a very good example of an Imperial IPA, but in my opinion is not quite worthy of currently being ranked sixteenth best beer on planet earth. Not all that complex, but still, very enjoyable. 943 characterslpayette, May 25, 2008

S. Wow! Grapefruit, pine cones, citris, mmm the smell is amazing!
T. Hops flow over my tongue, sweet malt (honey)
M. smooth, silky, very sticky syrup hops, lightly carbonated.
D. I could drink this all the time. For a 9% beer I could'nt taste the alcohol but I could feel it twoard the end. Very balanced IAPA/DIPA. My wife loved this beer. Thanks again to jeonseh for this beer. 515 charactersmikeale, May 25, 2008

A= This ale poured a dark burnt orange color. The chill haze gave this brew a beautiful luminescent quality. The tan head was 1/4 inch and disappeared quickly. Very minimal lacing down the glass. 
S= Lots of syrupy hop oil bringing piney and citrus aromas. Some fruity qualities leading to an alcohol bite. 
T= This brew faked me out at first as it seems like each swallow will be very hoppy and fruity, but it very quickly turns to a medicinal flavor in the middle with an alcohol finish. Bready and sweet malts flavors dance around in there too! Quite a complex combination... 
MF= Very light carbonation release coupled with a syrupy feel makes an oily feel in the mouth. Medim bodied. 
D= I think this is a hoppy late night sipper. A bit too heavy for a session beer, yet quite enticing all the same. I will enjoy this one often! 908 charactersspointon, May 22, 2008

Pours apricot with 3+ fingers of sand colored head. Good lacing & head retention
S: Pineyness, leafy hops, & apricots, caramel & honey, plus biscuitty malt
T: Pineyness, honey malt, grapefruit & caramel up front. Biscuitty malt, pineapple, apricots & pears as this warms, plus some booze & grapefruit. Finishes with an aggressive grapefruit snap, some breadyness & a touch of booze & nice honey malt
MF: Big chewyness, some syruppy notes, a low but persistent carbonation & superior balance
Crazy drinkability, the ABV is well hidden, would love to drink this on regular basis. Simply one of the best, if not the best DIPAS I've ever had! I'm sure having this on draft or cask would just be a zen experience 836 charactersrusspowell, May 21, 2008

22oz. brown bomber
A: poured into a snifter. Color is a cloudy amber that is more orange than red. nice slightly off white head that has a low retention rate and leads to faint lacing.
S: strong rich oaky aroma that reminds me of an oak aged stout. Strong hops aroma that is mostly citrus and pine, with pine being the lead. some small amounts of vanilla, coconut and some cherries. 
T: amazing flavor! nice toasted and caramel malts supply a great backdrop for this beer. Wonderful citrus flavors from the hops, more of a sweet orange flavor. Some mild pine flavors. no strong alcohol flavors either.
M: amazingly smooth for almost 10%. medium to full bodied. low to medium carbonation.
D: this beer is phenomenal. smooth, delicious, and it lacks the high alcohol taste. granted its not a session beer at 9.5%, but I could drink this all day long. unbelievable. 905 characterspaulthebeerguru, May 20, 2008

Poured a substantial white head into a 16 oz pint glass. Appearance was a golden yellow with an orange hue. Was a bit cloudy, that cleared as the beer warmed. Rings of lacing coated the glass.
Aroma: Fruity, floral, citrus, some pine notes.
Taste: a well balanced DIPA, not as bitter on the back of the palate as most. 
Mouthfeel: silky, a bit oily.
Drinkability: this is very drinkable for a DIPA. I could drink a couple of bombers no problem.
Overall, not my favorite DIPA but definitely on my short list. 548 charactersJonathanL7890, May 13, 2008

A really terrific DIPA, which is one of my favorite styles. As good as the hype.

A- Appears a copper golden color with a light head on top that built up a little bit, but stayed a little muted and fell reasonably quickly but did give a good amount of lacing. 
S- gives a huge citrus and grapefruit scents with lots of grassy piney character. great hop bomb, malts are pretty muted, pretty impressive for a 9.5 % abv. 
T- grassy and grapefruit all over huge piney charachter, what you would expect. the finish is surprizingly not bitter, but there is a torrent of hoppiness & bitterness all over. 
M- full body and a high carbonation taht goes well with the hoppiness.
D- pretty damn awesome 683 charactersAtron67, May 10, 2008
4.57/5  rDev +4.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5pours a crystal clear amber into a tulip. Fluffy two-finger head slowly fades with spotty lacing all around. This is one of those DIPAs that you can smell from clear across the room. Huge grapefruit & pine notes are balanced nicely with a caramelly sweetness. Taste is similar, with a bitter kick in the finish. Smooth & creamy, with a bit of alchohol bite. The 9.5% is definately noticable, which hurts the drinkability a bit.
Overall, a fantastic brew, and one of the, if not the best example of a DIPA. A real pleasure to drink; a beer that should be sought out with purpose.

4.16/5  rDev -5.2%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.522 oz bottle. Pours a deep orange, cloudy, with almost no head. Aroma of, you guessed it, hops, citrusy hops. Initial flavor is somewhat sweet, with fruits that come out as it warms a little (I think it is apricot, but it could be mango or some other fruit). Flavor turns drier with the hop presence. After taste is very hoppy and you tend to keep that taste in your mouth for a while. Light to medium body, limited carbonation, limited lacing, and obvious alcohol involved. Very drinkable, wish I had a fresher bottle, but you take what you can get. 550 charactersjoekfsu, May 09, 2008
3.42/5  rDev -22.1%look: 3 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3 |  overall: 3.5This one didn't do it for me. Perhaps it wasn't aged properly, but it just seemed dull and ordinary.
My sample was undercarbonated - not quite flat - and poured with minimal head and a murky haze.
The beer had a buttery and biscuity malt backbone with a piney and citrus hop aftertaste followed by more butter.
Tasted like bitter hot buttered popcorn in the end.
Methinks the sample would have been much better fresh, but after just recently drinking a Moylans double the other day, it simply blew this beer away. 517 charactersSixpoint, May 09, 2008

Smells big on hops, lots of juniper and spruce as well as some caramel, grapefruit, citrus rind, and a slight alcohol warmth. Tastes of earthy notes are quickly taken over by a sweet caramel flavor followed by an explosion of hops; citrus, grass, and a huge pine cone forest attack mingling with some spicy hop notes as well. Medium in body with good carbonation, a big bitter hopbomb with a good caramel backbone to balance out the assault and sweeten it up a bit. Pine loaded with a dry but sweet finish and some alcohol warmth but not overpowering. A superior DIPA with fantastic hop flavors and a good sweet malt presence. Though it is higher in alcohol, dread not, this stuff is easy to drink and fantastic. 840 charactersHopDerek, May 09, 2008

Aroma is outstanding, massive citrus, pungent pine, bright floral, and fruit. Big malt underneath. THis is gonna be good!
Flavor equally outstanding, freshly skinned tangerine, grapefruit, and orange. There's sticky pine sap and resinous, oily marijuana notes. The hop onslaught fades out with fresh sweet wildflowers. Massive caramel, toffee, and honey malt notes give this beer a serious balance in spite of the incredible hops. 
Body is big, sticky, and creamy. So god damned delicious and dangerously drinkable. Better than the hype and worth whatever you paid ot traded. 704 charactersAlexJ, May 08, 2008

4.77/5  rDev +8.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5L: Poured into a tulip glass. It pours an almost orange/burnt copper color with a rich off white head that leaves a trail of lacing on the glass as it disappears. Carbonation can be seen bubbling up within the cloudy color.
S: An explosion of hops hits the nose. I could smell the hops way before my nose came close to the glass. Slight backdrop of floral as well.
T: A big hit of hops strikes the tongue first, but balanced enough with the citrus hops and malts to not invoke a bitter reaction to it. The carbonation and multitude of hops keep the taste lingering around for a while. A great balance of bitter and citrus hops throughout, dominates the taste, but in a very pleasing way. Alcohol content barely noticeable.
F: A slightly dry, medium bodied beer. The remnants of hops and carbonation remind you of the beer for a while after swallow.
D: A very drinkable IIPA. The hops are balanced enough to allow this to just keep disappearing from your glass without making an overly bitter impression. The strong nose along with big taste of this beer make this a pleasure to bring to your mouth. 1,098 charactersScrumtralecent, May 08, 2008

Pours a mostly clear bright golden color. A moderate pour results in nearly a finger of off-white head, which receded leaving little lacing. Aroma is massive amounts of hops. Grassy hops, piny hops, lots of citrus, tangerine, lemon.
Taste starts with a sweet maltiness up front. Lots of citrus flavors, especially tangerine, orange, and lemon. A slight buttery flavor lurks in there. Huge hop flavor on the back end. Lots of hop bitterness but not overwhelming. The alcohol content is barely noticeable. A very well balanced taste between the malt and amount of hops.
Lightly carbonated, it feels thick and is kinda slick from the hop oil. Leaves a coating on the back of the tongue. Drinkability is very good. The hop flavor and bitterness are not overwhelming. The alcohol creeps up on me. For an IIPA it's very drinkable. 885 charactersbkilpatr, May 08, 2008

Pours an orangey amber with ever so slight haze (chill?) and an ok, but should be bigger, fluffy white head that leaves ok lacing. Smells like a bag of pellet hops. Taste is much more balanced than the nose with a great malt profile and superb hop flavors. Some orange/grapefruit citrus flavors with some pine showing up. Malt and hop resin mixture provides almost an orange glaze flavor. A good crispness toward the finish. Hop bitterness is good on the finish, but the malt sweetness also lingers. Mouthfeel is almost perfect, I think it could be just a tiny touch thinner, but it is damn neer perfect. Drinkability is very dangerous here. Overall this is one of the most balanced IPAs I have had the pleasure of drinking. A wonderful brew from FFF. Enjoyed with seared salmon, seared scallops, dirty rice, and salad. Highly recommended. 878 charactersAKBelgianBeast, May 07, 2008

Pours a cloudy (bottle-conditioned) orange amber with a thin head that dissipates immediately. No visible carbonation. Moderate lacing. 
Floral, hoppy nose with tones of lime, alcohol and vegetal matter.
Sweet, caramel malt upfront with notes of chocolate and coffee, followed by a touch of bitterness and a shudder of alcohol. As it warms, Dreadnaught IPA becomes cloyingly sweet as the citrus takes over: imagine thick mango and peach syrups. Where's the effen bitterness? This stuff finishes like orange Triametic cough syrup. Ack! 
An easy sipper considering the over-the-top ABV and IBUs, but unduly sweet - especially for a DIPA. 
The label proclaims: "It's not normal." If that's the case, I'd be better served if normal was overhyped, overpriced and annoyingly sweet. 956 charactersCaptainIPA, May 04, 2008

Caramel flavor comes in later, with alcohol so well hidden it seems almost unnoticeable. Mouthfeel is impeccable, bitter sweetness rolls through the mouth with no remorse.
I could, and will, drink this until the day it (or I) dies. All around, an incredible beer, and should not be missed by anyone, especially a lover of IIPAs. 573 characterspaco1029384756, Apr 30, 2008

This was a very clear copper in color and the nose was filled with scents of grapefruit, piney hops, caramel and spice. In the mouth the midpalate was rich and mouth-coating with solid weight. While there were tons of hops, they were well-balanced with some sweet malt. Again, with tons of hops, the finish had the bitterness one would expect but it was well balanced with malt that it did not come off as overtly bitter and dry. This is an extremely balanced with that has lots of everything. Yum! 591 charactersSQNfan, Apr 24, 2008
4.65/5  rDev +5.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Thanks ever so much to Kingpin for the bottle. This poured a clear reddish amber color(on my second pour, the yeast which had settled to the bottom poured out and now it's a hazy reddish amber). The smell is slight, but has a hoppy as well as a butterscotchy smell. The taste-where to begin? It has an almost burning hop presence, with citrus and earthy flavors predominating, although there hints of spruce or pine as well. There is a strong sweet malty flavor and a hint of butterscotch to round it out. While I wouldn't call this a smooth blending of contrasting flavors, it is instead that harder to achieve all- out war of competing yet complementary flavors, all of which demand my attention. This is an amazing beer and the best DIPA I've ever had. Now if they could only distribute to Minnesota! 803 charactersedbeered, Apr 23, 2008

A: Pours a hazy orangish amber with a small head that dissipates fairly quickly leaving a nice lacing and a few odd bubbles floating around the top.
S: Big citrus hop blast up front with a nice sweet malty aroma to balance it out. Definitely getting major whiffs of orange and grapefruit with some background floral aroma as well.
T: Initial sweet caramel, malty flavor makes way for the aforementioned citric hop blast. Final taste is of piny hops that I didn't get as much in the aroma. Great balance between sweetness and bitterness.
M: Very creamy mouthfeel with little carbonation.
D: A very unique and terrific DIPA. It teeters on the brink of being over the top without quite tipping over. I'm not sure I could drink this all night, but I'd definitely seek it out. 871 charactersgford217, Apr 19, 2008
4.69/5  rDev +6.8%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5From a 22oz bomber poured into my GI tulip glass.
A - A color that I would say looks like orange tinted syrup. There was a small but quickly dissipating head that did not last long. Has a hint of tangerine and gold in there as well. There is also a lot of carbonation trickling up this one. On the whole has a nice reflective sheen to it.
S - I love this nose whether from a bottle or on tap. Smells of candied pineapple, mango, orange and a hint of bitter hops as well. Even when a little cold this was really big nose and just gets bigger as it warms up. Also get a hint of caramel malt that adds a touch of sweetness as well. 
T - What a mix of hops and malt. Originally, very sweet up front and get a big hit of mango and pineapple. After awhile thought the hops sneak up and smack you with a big hit of grapefruit hops that give you a bitter taste in the mouth. I have to say I actually thought that the hops profile was more bitter and the malt was less sweet than when I had it on tap. However, on the whole, the beer seems to have a bit less pop on the whole than when I had it on tap.
MF - An exceptionally smooth brew with a little bit of carbonation that helps to cut through the stickiness that this brew has. The carbonation helps to prevent this one from being cloying and makes it rather nice. Has a nice alcoholic tingle on the backside which you can feel but can't at all taste.
D - Overall, one of my favorite IIPAs. It has a big malt profile that gives this beer a nice sweet aspect that helps to keep it balanced. The hops are still pronunced enough that you realize they are there and they give you enough of a kick to say Wow. Plus, it is hard to believe that this is actually 9.5% ABV. I have to say the bottle is good but lacks a bit compared to the on tap. If you can get it on tap, drink it because it will be one of the best experiences of your beer life. If not, this bomber is still great just pales a bit in comparison. Good with food and by itself and easy to drink at any time. Super good beer. 2,031 charactersjeonseh, Apr 16, 2008

A - Pours a golden color, with a very thick look. Decent amount of carbonation is there. Don't see much for haze.
S - Potent smell. Incredible amount of citrus power that comes from something like cascade hops. Some grapefruit as well. Its almost sharp on the nose. Earthy and grassy as well.
T - That earthy flavors really dominate this one. Its almost like I'm drinking grass at times. This has to be hopped in the extreme. Very bitter, but does have some malt notes. Wraps up with the warming of the alcohol.
M - Creamy and thick. Carbonation doesn't hit the pallet hard. Goes down easy, doesn't fill me up.
D - This baby has alot of bite that makes me drink it slow. I like that in a way, but its not the easiest drinking beer. But then its a DIPA, what do I expect.
Something is wrong here with this one - I admit liking it on tap at their brewery, but this one isn't striking me very well. The grassy notes is almost overbearing and it makes me skittish on drinking more. 1,012 characterskatan, Apr 10, 2008

Poured a nice amber with some haze and an off-white head about 1.5 fingers high. Lacing settled to small rings around the glass as it went down and head disappeared after a bit.
Some grapefruit bitter hints in the smells, but mostly it's just dominated by nice hops. Round aroma with just a bit of a bite-very nice. 
The hops hits you right away in the taste and is the dominant character going down although there is some slight maltiness and sweetness mixed in along with the light fruit notes. 
Overall it is a very light and tasty for an IPA this strong and it goes down much smoother than I would have imagined with this sort of ABV. I'd like to drink more of it but it could be dangerous especially with bottles this big. I will definitely try this one again if given the opportunity. 886 charactersjspruit, Apr 05, 2008

I poured from the capped bomber into a tulip while sharing this brew with friends at a tasting event held on a dock located on the Columbia River in Southeast Washington.
A: It poured a hazy, lazy orange with a decent off white head, plenty of carbonation, and lingering lacing.
S: It had a dominant citrusy aroma balanced well by sweet white fruits and caramel malts. The aromas were inviting and complex making it a treat to move from smelling to drinking.
T: It coated the tongue early with a big toasted malt sweetness that was then infused with citrusy and tangy hops (tangy oranges and lemons) and then finished off with sweet ripe white fruits (pears and apples). It finished clean with little aftertaste. It was an extremely well balanced brew with an interesting and entertaining blend of hops and malts.
M: It was medium to full-bodied with an entertaining mouth presence and a warm and clean finish. The alcohol is well hidden.
D: It was a smooth and richly complex brew that was entertaining to drink and a joy to experience. 1,122 charactersdnichols, Apr 05, 2008

D: I could drink these things till the sun came up, but I'd probably end up on the floor twitching or something. 
Overall... The ussual BIG price tag on the bombers turned me off to this beer, especially since it's no more than an hour drive away, but I might seek this one out in the future. Big PLUS is the 4 dollar price tag at The Long Room. A steal... 825 charactersamiles, Apr 01, 2008

4.12/5  rDev -6.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4thanks to Lightindarkness for this one! Poured into a goblet. Nice hazy orange/amber color. thin white head that leaves good amount of lacing. Smell is delish- lots of citrusy hops. Taste warms me! Solid flavor, lots of biterness, but also smooths as it goes down. Good balance for a DIPA. This one gets better as I drink it. Some graininess, but overall very drinkable. Another amazing offering from FFF. 405 charactersDrDogbeer, Mar 29, 2008
4.57/5  rDev +4.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Appearance: Cloudy and dark golden brew. Tiny head disappears leaving a slight ring around the glass.
Smell: Sweet and fruity scents mixed with spiciness and citrusy hops. Very nice aroma.
Taste: Very good. You initially get a malty sweet and fruity flavor that transitions to a nice citrus hop flavor. After the swallow, the hop flavor lingers and becomes piney. Very tasty and very complex. 
Mouthfeel: Nice and thick but also very smooth. There is a good bit of carbonation present as well. As mentioned, very nice flavor left behind, and there is even complexity to the aftertaste. 
Drinkability: Very good beer that would only be hurt by its heaviness. Definitely one of the most balanced DIPA's out there with a good amount of the sweet and the bitter. Highly recommended. 782 charactershellcatsjg, Mar 21, 2008
4.26/5  rDev -3%look: 3 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Poured into a snifter from the 22oz bottle. The off-white lacing disappeared almost entirely very quickly. However there are a lot of carbonation bubbles clinging to the sides of the glass below the meniscus. The beer is a nice, soft orange/amber color with a slight haze.
Wow. This beer smells delicious. I love hops and this one definitely delivers. Smells warm, citrusy and a little sweet. Small hints of spice also present. A little fruity smelling as well, I mean this differently from the citrus that I noticed. I guess I'm noticing more fruity notes like grapes, apples or strawberries normally remind you of; but I'm not specifically noticing exactly which fruit I'm smelling.
First sip left sour pains in the back of my mouth. Excellent. Lots of hop character present in this one. The bitterness fades to a slightly toasted flavor on the back end. Also noticing some anise as well.
Mouthfeel is amazingly light and crisp, I was not expecting this at all. It only adds to the drinkability of this beer, which is very high. Alcohol is well-hidden.
You've got to love hop bitterness to enjoy this beer I think. If you do, you're in for a great treat. 1,160 charactersabankovich, Mar 21, 2008
3.9/5  rDev -11.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Hazy orange pour with a lasting creamy beige head atop. Smell is nice and aromatic with big fruity, citrusy hops in the nose. Taste was hopped but not nearly as much as expected and had strong notes of orange, peachiness to it. Candied bitter orange peel flavor to it. Much more balanced than expected. Decent body and a bitter orange finish. Mild alcohol presence but a very nicely drinkable IIPA. My rating will probably go up drinking this in more than a sample glass size at a time and looking forward to trying it again. 525 charactersJDV, Mar 20, 2008

Smells awesome - floral & fruity - lots of citrus.
Starts out fruity, lots of grapefruit and other citrus. The hops are also piney after that. Just enough malt to keep it smooth. A touch of alcohol.
Mouthfeel is surprisingly smooth with almost no carbonation.
Awesome beer. I feel this may soon outgrow my budget, so I thoroughly enjoy it while I can.

4.3/5  rDev -2.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Bought a bunch of this at Binny's to stock up with.
Popping it's cap, I smelled the floral and citrus right away. It was a noseful and got stronger as I poured it into a tulip glass. The carbonation was overpowering and created a head about 2 fingers thick before settling down. The tulip is a perfect glass for this imperial IPA beer.
It was no surprise that this beer was very sweet and malty with some citrus and pine elements. The traditional "signature 3F" hoppiness smell and taste definitely balanced it out.
This is a very drinkable beer - and watch out for it's ABV that'll sneak up on ya. One of my favorites. 622 charactersbgramer, Mar 05, 2008
4.59/5  rDev +4.6%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Obtained in trade from MuenchenerKindl, contents poured into a Stone OG tulip glass, currently #13 on BA
Appearance is an opaque dull orange with some amber highlights, thin layer of off-white creamy foam that dissipates to a ring, swaths of sticky lacing on the glass
Smell is big, fragrant hops, mostly floral and pine resin, slight citrus tones, caramel and toast malts linger as does slight alcohol, very flavorful and delicious
Taste is initially sweetened pine hops, transitions to thick chewy caramel and bready malts, tones of oranges and cotton candy, finishes bitter with a hint of alcohol warming
Mouthfeel is medium-bodied, creamy and slick resiny texture, carbonation is ample but moderate
Drinkability is high given the abv, a flavorful and balanced DIPA that has a nice interplay of hops and malts, I am impressed with the hop presence and this continues my obsession with this midwestern brewery 916 charactersStoneman78, Mar 03, 2008

Pours a nice burnt orange with no head. The smell is lovely. A nice hoppy aroma dominates the smell of this beer. Its very very nice. The taste is very hoppy w/ a mild touch of alcohol. I really enjoy this Imperial IPA. This is a very drinkable beer for the ABV. I really enjoy this brew!

Beautiful appearance. It has that glowing gold/orange color. This is a legend, and I cant' wait to dive in.
Smells very malty for an IPA. I am shocked by the sweetness in the nose of this beer. Looking forward to seeing what the taste has in store for me. Taste is a phenomenal surprise. The floral sweetness is amazing, but the hops come in and balance out the taste quite well. This is the sweetest this beer has ever tasted for me, and I have had it several other times. What a complex beer.
Highly recommended. One of the best IPAs out there. 686 charactersbassmantin, Feb 27, 2008

A-Golden orange with some red highlights, 3/4 inch creamy white head, stuck around forever, some sticky lacing at the beginning
S-Pine and citrus dominated at first, then malt scents arose when it warmed, started to smell real sweet after a while, toasty at times too
T-First fews sips had a lot of pine in it and then it seemed to disappear, leaving behind lemon and grapefruit tastes, then the large malt backbone really kicked in with sweet and chewy accents, a little floral at times, nicely balanced when it is colder, but malt could become overwhelming once it warms, tasty DIPA overall
M-Thick body for its style, not much carbonation, bitter and sweet mouthfeel, taste lingers for a good amount of time
D-Could have finished this bomber but chose not to, not too heavy for how sweet it becomes, almost ten percent alcohol though, it is hidden well, smooth
Regretted not buying this at Walnut Liquorette when I saw it for fifteen dollars, so then I had to trade for it, been wanting to try this one for quite some time, a little disappointed to be honest but still an above average double IPA, would drink again, recommended 1,292 charactersFloydster, Feb 26, 2008

It smells of some roasted malts followed by a ton of hops. All sorts of citrisy, earthy, floral, and piney hops. The taste is excellent with a nice rich roasted malty base followed with a huge hop bitterness but it blends very well with the malts. The citirisy hop bitterness is blended very well with the piney and floral hops. The mouthfeel is crisp and bitter. The drinkability is good, especially for a beer this big. 513 characterserosier, Feb 24, 2008

The 22 oz bomber poured into a tulip glass produced a fingers worth of head that turned to lace rather quickly. It has a wonderfull clear copper body 
Aromas of pine and citrus a very nice floral smell as well 
Flavors of sweet malt up front that kind of surprised me it really help balance out the piney hop bitter 
Nice carbonation medium body with a truly smooth almost oily finish 
Very drinkable beer I want to try it again I wish there was a freshness date on the bottle being so highly rated I didn't think it was up to the hype Its good don't get me wrong I can think of a few that I like better thought 678 charactersjoepais, Feb 22, 2008
4.87/5  rDev +10.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5From Notes. 22 oz bottle. Review #500!
Pour: crystal clear, vibrant golden-amber under a shortish white skim of foam.
Nose: An opus of hop complexity - grapefruit, apricot and pine, with notes of brandy, grape juice and intense sweet caramel.
Taste: biscuit/caramel malts, juicy grapefruit, resinous pine sap. Good interplay between sweet and bitter profiles. Boozy bite in the finish.
Feel: dense, but slick and smooth, with peppery carbonation
Drinkibility/Overall: Rock solid for the style. Hits all the right notes with an incredibly intense nose and taste. Not the most complex DIPA I've had overall, but impressively balanced. High premium makes this a rare treat however. 683 charactersGolden2wenty1, Feb 21, 2008

S: wow does this have nose! I haven't encountered any IPA that smells this sweet. i actually get a fair amount of luscious caramel here at first with floral and pine in the background. 
T: very sweet caramel and apple flavor with a slightly boozy finish along with some ripe grapefruit and pine in the background. the hops are definitely not the highlight of this beer but seems to be more malty and balanced. definite alcohol presence, slightly warming.
M: oily and very lightly carbonated (maybe a little flat at this point?)

this has a massive sweet and thick malt backbone, with a hop carachter that I've not encountered too many times before.
The beer is an orangish amber and the hops come across as full on citrus with touches of pineapple, and mango.
I really, really like Dreadnaught and unfortunately can't get it too often.
Whatever 3F's does to its hops they are doing it well. 410 charactersmanleyphoto, Feb 15, 2008

Pours a hazy golden/orange color with a thin head that leaves some sticky lacing.
Smell is of sweet piney hops, nice floral aroma, strong citrus presence to this one.
Whoa, quite the kick to it right off the bat, seems like a cross between an IPA and a barleywine really, strong citrus hop taste melded with a sweet caramel malt and a slight fruitiness, can easily tell this is a strong beer though as it's a bit warming. The hop presence was also a bit weaker than I would imagine for this DIPA, might have faded since there's no way of telling with a lack of freshness date on the bottle. 652 charactersdeltatauhobbit, Feb 15, 2008

Big rocky 2 finger head ... sorta light yellow .. beautiful lacing .. brew is light hazy orange.
Aroma is big complex hops ... massive floral, citrus rind and a touch of pine... whaffs of toasted malt... smells amazing.
Not nearly as bitter as many West Coast DIPA's.. very balanced ... massively complex hop flavor appears in waves and finishes for minutes after a nice sip... I am assuming that this bottle is very fresh.. it is simply fantastic... good sweetness mid palate helps tie all the hoppiness together... big hop resins ... pine .. grapefruit .. and less floral notes than the aroma... again very very balanced.. light toasted malts and just touches of caramel. medium body and fairly light carbonation.
This is only the second time I've had the Dreadnaught ... this bottle just tastes alot fresher. John is a great trader and has a very nice taste for hoppiness... recommended beer and trader. 1,060 charactersJohnGalt1, Feb 15, 2008

Brilliant orange in colour with a hint of a murky haze for good measure. White lace stuck well to the pint glass. Huge aromas of pine juice and citrus twistings. Some diacetyl noted for good measure. Surprisingly light on the palate, this one is oviously all about the hops The alcohol, while quite warming, is hidden well in all of the hops. The malt back bone plays a pleasant second fiddle. Well balanced and controlled. A fantastic brew, especially on a chilly fall day.

Pours a hazy orange color, with a clingy white head and thin, but sticky lacing.
Smell is all hops, grassy and citrus, with a subtle, smooth malt backing. There is a metallic twinge that I can't quite place.
Taste is big, sweet hops, with a pleasantly bitter finish. The malt, hops, and alcohol all join to form one of the most exquisitely crafted beers I've ever had. Smooth and sweet and bitter and boozy. Amazing.
Mouthfeel is dead-on, slick and creamy to help the hops.
Drinkability is fantastic for such a strong beer. Nothing sticks out as too intense.

4.51/5  rDev +2.7%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4The crazy-hyped, vaunted, hyperbole-slathered Dreadnaught has a pretty weak head despite a good hard pour. Color is nice though, a subtly clouded copper/amber/orange that absolutely shimmers when held to light.
The aroma kicks things into high gear. Big sweet candylike hops lean far into piney territory. Has a nice malty pull underneath that keeps it from being one-dimensional. A lusty liqueur-like aroma emerges as it warms. There's a world to offer the nose, and I sat and took it in for a long while, but enough of the sniffing now, I cannot wait to drink this...
An incredible dose of pine dominates, with a hit of gritty sugar sweetness, cherry-flavored corn syrup, astringent grassy bitterness, and a lightly boozy sherry/cough medicine-like backup in the finish. This is huge, sweet and candylike, and may not feature the most tongue-ripping hops I've ever had and that's a compliment. The hoppiness is gargantuan but the beer is infused with enough different layers of flavors to keep it from being a mere novelty. (In this way, it reminds me of New Old Lompoc's C-Note.) 
Mouthfeel is completely spot-on, just how I like a Double IPA to feel...thick, creamy, tingly, round...plenty of depth and weight but escaping any syrupy oppressiveness.
This is fantastic, but even if I could get a hold of this on a more regular basis, I'm not sure I'd do anything else but save it for those special and rare occasions. It's intense, so the drinkability isn't great, but still, it's a freakin' wonderful beer, and there's no way to call it anything but outstanding. 1,570 charactersMetalmonk, Feb 07, 2008
3.63/5  rDev -17.3%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Ordered a bomber at The Farmhouse in Emmaus.
I have to say I'm a little underwhelmed. This beer was just too balanced, it reminded me more of an imperial red like Southern Tier's Big Red. There's a good citrus and spicy hop element that lasts into the aftertaste, but the malt is too big in both the aroma and taste. There's also the distinct, almost toasty Three Floyds house character that's especially big in the aroma, which is nice, but is another element that is bigger than it should be in comparison to the hops. I'm not sure if I should commend this beer for its drinkability, but it went down fairly easily. I guess I was expecting more hop bite. Alas. 663 characterstempest, Feb 02, 2008
4.82/5  rDev +9.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured from a 1pt 6oz bottle into a tulip. Almost no head. No lace left down the glass. Murky burnt orange color. Not much active carbonation.
I would expect more hops in the nose of a DIPA. Hops very subdued - more floral and mellow than many of the style. Fruity esters - smells of citrus.
Very balanced taste. Carmely malt backbone. Sweeter than most, but not in bad way. Citrus fruits are the first thing that comes to mind in regards to the hops. Very nice hops prescence that is not overpowering or bitter. Crisp clean slightly bitter aftertaste that doesn't linger on the palate too long. Alcohol not apparent in the taste, but warms the throat and chest.
Viscous thick and malty while in your mouth and leaves a oily, slick prescence after swallowing. Carbonation is low.
Very drinkable for the alcohol content. A really big beer, but it leaves me wanting more.
An exceptional and unique DIPA. More malt and less hops than most beers of the style. Hops have a nice strong citrusy prescence without being extremely bitter. 1,034 characterselmore, Feb 01, 2008
4/5  rDev -8.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Appearance - Extremely hazy burnt orange; it's very nearly opaque. The off-white head has great retention.
Smell - Grapefruit, peach, caramel apple. Gentle floral and citrus hops. Sweeter and fruitier than most DIPAs, but still pleasantly aromatic.
Taste - Evenly balanced between malts and hops. Very fruity; notes of peach, grapefruit and pineapple. Sweet, biscuity malts provide a strong backbone for the floral, slightly resiny hop flavor. A large dose of bittering hops come out in the finish, balancing (but not overpowering) the fruity sweetness.
Mouthfeel - Full-bodied, creamy and surprisingly gentle; soft and bubbly on the tongue.
Notes - Really nice stuff, though I prefer the drier character of West Coast IPAs. Thanks to hrking for the chance to try this. 773 characterslargadeer, Jan 25, 2008
4.79/5  rDev +9.1%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Holy smoke!!!!
First off my bottle sat in my beer fridge for a while so the first pour was a bit clearer than advertised. gorgeous copper-amber with a light ivory head that faded to a slight laceing.
very complex aroma, peaches,tart apples, cherry kool-aide, orange juice, ruby port, floral aroma of lillies. and a booziness that is reminecent of brandy. maybe a bit of arope jam.(a grape must and pumpkin jam from spain). Every sniff gives a juicy bag that changes.
The Fruit bomb continues with each sip. The aroma took so much of my time that it warmed to a proper temp. back to the flavors; cherry medicine, mixed with sweet biscuity with a corn syrup grind that works well with the fruit to give authenticity. grape fruit juice with out pith. also floral notes that lend major nods to rose. slight raisen and maderia hang twards the end before the chewiness take hold. Perhaps a ravage of age on this bottle(approx 9 mo.old.)
Sweet sugary mouthfeel held in check by fruit esther and hop resin pleasant chew.
This is the most interestin and challenging IPA i have ever had. even at the high ABV. i found it so dynamic and fun that I can't wait to find another.

Thanks younger35 for passing me a bottle.
Aroma is so refreshing. Tons of citrus and floral hops and caramel attacking the nose. This beer was sweeter than I expected. I needed that extra sweetness to make the hop bitterness acceptable. Sweetness and bitterness manages to balance pretty well.
There is a stickiness on the lips. Mouthfeel manages to be a bit creamy. There was a little carbonation dance on the tongue.
I enjoyed this beer and look forward to trying it again it a little later. 506 charactersLittleBreeze, Jan 21, 2008

This beer smells delicious. Sweet oranges, sour grapefruits, and a boatload of piney / floral hops. A touch of alcohol peeks in from behind.
Huh, tastes nothing like it smells. Weird. Just kidding. Tons upon tons of citrus fruits and hops are piled on my taste buds yet it is not overly bitter. The weight of the alcohol in this one transforms it into an extremely thick, full, and chewy brew.
This beer is impressive. I'm buzzin' right now and want to relax and enjoy the rest of this tasty treat, so I'll cut to the chase. F*ckin Great! 632 charactersSlynger, Jan 07, 2008

A good swirl brings back the head right back, all smooth and gentle like. The nose isn't quite as potent as you'd expect from an IIPA, but that doesn't stop it from being lovely. There is a bunch of hops, a resinous load of hop oil with citrus and gooey caramel.
The taste is much more massive, a truckload of hops crashed into this beer. It comes in thick oils, citrus and fruits, sweet divine and warm but bitter and on the verge of out of control. It sweetens but with a burst of malts and ends with a bittering streak. The mouth is pretty full, pucking a lot from the bitterness, slightly warm, but not well enough carbonated. In all, a very tasty beer, but still hasn't lived up to the legend and hype for me. 911 charactersobjectivemonkey, Jan 07, 2008

M:Big thick and syrupy makes it very mouth pleasing
D: Everything comes togethor perfect in this beer. The malts and the hops pull you both ways. Awesome! 444 charactersScoobydank, Jan 04, 2008

a: Cloudy orange body with a thin white head and no lacing.
s: Remarkable aroma of hop oil, pine and citrus. 
A truly wonderful smell.
t: Caramel malt briefly makes an appearance before a wave of delicious hops engulfs the tongue. Excellent flavors of pine, citrus, and grain. Though this beer exhibits a remarkable hop flavor, the bitterness is not too high. Could be a result of it's modest aging in my closet, just couldn't bring myself to drink my only bottle. 
m: Light carbonation, creamy texture, smooth finish.
d: Ok, I'm a huge fan of 3 Floyds, they run a great brewery, they pay remarkable attention to the quality of their product, they make exquisite beer, and I love the collection of outside beers they have available at the brewery. That being said, the selfish side of me is dying for them to expand so I can get more of their beer. Its just not fair!
Needless to say, I think this is a great beer. I could drink it all night if I could get my hands on enough of it. 1,063 charactersBradLikesBrew, Jan 02, 2008

Slightly hazy orange color with a negligible head, though it left lovely froth on top that looked like cirrus clouds and had decent lacing. My oh my, this smelled delicious! Hops, hops, hops, of course, but also plenty of citrusy notes. Lemon, orange, grapefruit. Notes of pine and alcohol, too. Wow! The smell hit me as soon as I popped the cap. Tasted like a hop sensation. It's been a while since I've had a hoppy brew and this reminded me of how much I love them. Both deliciously sweet and harshly bitter at the same time. I love it. Nice and full body, without being overly thick. I will definitely get one of these the next time I need a hop fix. 712 charactersatrus138, Jan 01, 2008

Smells very good, Great floral arouma of citruis hops and good malt balance.
Taste is the style standard. Pungant hops delivered with perfect malt balance. Does not have to pucker effect that most IIPAs have. Just invites another drink.
Feels great. Slick not syrupy. Taste lingers just enough to invite more sips.
I am a big fan of the IIPAs and this is about as good as it can get. Where some are good but challanging to drink because of the amount of hops, this nails it. More than a IPA, but not obnoixious. Very, very good. 584 charactersHomerbag, Dec 31, 2007

This 2IPA was WELL worth the $12 price tag.
It pours an orange cloudy haze with little to no head which I poured into a standard pint glass.
There is citrus to be had everywhere and a bushel of hops... and it doesn't let up all. Fruit notes assaulting you like an orge. Grapefruit, orange, more grapefruit. Unbelievably hoppy! A nice scent of floral hops.
It was a hot day and I enjoyed this with a Cuban Montecristo on my brother-in-laws back porch. Now, there's a full evening, my friends.
If you're a fan of IPA's... you need to seek this one out. It was the perfect compliment to a perfect summer eve. 644 charactersrudylaw, Dec 31, 2007

This thing assaulted me with its citrusy hop aroma 2 seconds after I cracked it open. Unbelievably citrusy aroma, pineapple or peach or something. 
This is just over the top hoppiness here and I love it. Juicy citrusy hop flavor all the way. You know what you're getting when you open this and it doesn't disappoint.
Fabulous all the way around here. Too bad I didn't get a case. Got 5 left and was thinking about trading some but not sure I can get rid of this. 589 charactersTilley4, Dec 29, 2007

A: Deep orange/copper color with about 1 finger of creamy white head. Head doesn't stay all that long, but long enough to look good in the glass. There is a slight haze to the beer.
S: Soft hops. Flowery/piney hops aroma is very pleasant and not overpowering. Also, there is a backbone of malt aroma. Very complex and inviting.
T: Wow! Perfect amount of maltiness and hoppiness. Starts out sweet and fruity and finishes very clean and citrusy. Not overly bitter like some DIPAs. The lingering taste reminds me of grapefruits. Complex and wonderful. Again, wow!
M: Great body and mouthfeel. Full but not syrupy. Carbonation is balanced.
D: I could definitely have a couple more.
Overall, probably the best D/IPA I've tasted. Pick one up if you can. 766 charactersFatheadBrew, Dec 27, 2007

The aroma, and the taste, are excellent. A pine/malt backbone, tons of delicious sweetness from mangoes?papayas?apricots? and a host of other fruit all layered with a bitter grapefruit hop aftertaste. Mouthfeel is just thick enough. 
Great, if I had this available locally, I'd be buying it regularly. 405 charactersOverlord, Dec 25, 2007
4.47/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4A 22oz bomber, delivering a keg's worth of taste...
A  Poured a very hazy orange color. Not much head, leaving some bubbly patches on top.
S  About as rich and aromatic as any IIPAs Ive tried. Plentiful malt characteristics come through the strong hops. Scents of toasted grains, grapefruit and fir.
T  Again, the word rich comes to mind. A very well balanced malty roundness really grounds the intense hops. Very bitter at the finish. Some notable tastes of grapefruit and conifer sap. Truly a balanced flavor with a sweet full maltiness and a cutting bitter hoppiness.
M  A smoother fuller beer than some, it has an oily quality with a little dryness from the alcohol. Again, an interesting balance of full and light, thick and thin. 
D  I find this beer very well balanced and flavorful. The fullness and alcohol demand that this beer be sipped somewhat lightly, leaving it less drinkable to the weak-of-palate. 931 characterslightindarkness, Dec 21, 2007

Appearance- Pours a reddish orange with terrific clarity and a nice big fluffy white head. Leaves a spotty cap and big fluffy collar. Crazy amount of huge sticky lacing that doenst want to let go of glass.
Smell- Whoa! Big apricot and pineapple citrus is huge. Definitely the biggest burst of citrus Ive ever smelled in a brew. Doughy and full of malty goodness. A bit of alcohol but not all that much.
Taste- Wow, I honestly thought this thing was going to blow my taste buds off with bitterness, but its really nicely balanced. Apricot, pineapple, mango, and even a bit of raisin. Slightly sweet with a toffee like malt backbone. Sweet but not cloying, bitter but not ridiculously numbing. The alcohol is hidden pretty well and it finishes with a lingering fruity bitterness.
Mouthfeel- Full bodied. On the verge of being syrupy, but manages not to be. Medium carbonation that is spot on.
Drinkability- Well the $11.99 price tag really knocks the drinkability down but this is a terrific brew. Crazy balanced for being as big and bitter as this thing is. Three Floyds has managed to brew yet another winner. Super tasty stuff! 1,313 charactersyounger35, Dec 18, 2007

A: Hazy orange-amber. Plenty-o-head, but not perfection.
S: Pine(apple), Citrus, Hops, you know...but something tropical, too.

The aroma is incredible with lots of malts, apricots, caramel, and citrusy hops in the background.
Taste is a beautiful combination of sweet malts and citrusy hops. The alcohol comes out to say 'hello' but doesn't overpower.
Medium mouthfeel with an oily slickness to it. Carbonation is very light.

Pours a golden orange/amber hue. It has a medium dark off white head and left sheets of lacing from the top to the bottom of the glass when I was done with it.The floral bouquet on this beer is just about the best I have ever smelled before. Heavy pine and grapefruit scent with slight scents of orange citrus and more hop resins. The first taste is all hops. This is so well balanced because the hops are not overpowering or overly bitter but fresh and provide a unique flavor. The malt is a perfect balance to go along with the heavy hop bitterness. Sweet caramel notes also come into play as the beer warms. The mouthfeel is very heavy and coats your entire mouth and throat on the way down. The drinkability is very high for me. It's bitter, but not so much that I don't want to keep on drinking this. 839 charactersTheodorHerzl, Dec 05, 2007

Hazy amber pour, ivory head died fairly quick  but what the hell can you expect from this big booze bomb.
Lip smacking citrus aroma with a touch of prickly pine tossed in for good measure. Woody and resinous quaff, not as west coasty as I imagined  but still presents some orange and spice for an extra kick.
Stuff drinks like a dream, Im only sipping, but this bomber is disappearing at an alarming rate! The big alcohol is nowhere to be found. Tasty, you have to try one. 546 charactersVancer, Dec 01, 2007
4.84/5  rDev +10.3%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Poured into bowtie glass at the Three Floyds Brewpub in Munster, IN.
Appearance: Pour was deep orangish with a slight reddish hue with a beautiful hazy quality. Head was good and quickly dissipated with some lacing on the glass. 
Aroma: A godsend. The smell of apricots and mango's. Some piney hop notes. I couldn't get over how wonderful the hops were. Some malty and a trace amount of alcohol. 
Taste: This is probably the best IIPA I have eve had. Flavor's of hops and malty. Balance is perfect so that it is not overpowering as many IIPA's can be. Alcohol character is well disguised and I was surprised to later learn that this beer was 9.5% ABV. Bitterness is not lingering. Retro-nasal hops aroma makes burping fun. 
Mouthfeel: Carbonation is good. A slight drying from the hops but negligible alcohol burn in the finish. 
Drinkability: This might be the best thing about the beer. The balance of hops and malt and sweetness and bitterness just flowed. I could have sat and drank this beer all day (I wanted too). I can't say enough about it. Its the best for a reason. It hides lots of aroma, taste and alcohol in the most enjoyable package ever. 
I love it. 1,184 charactersbigman147, Nov 25, 2007

It pours a clear warm orange. This beer's color is an exploding star in the brilliant brewniverse.
Sticky smells of malt, tree resin, hops, and alcohol waif through across time and space.
This beer is so smooth I did not taste the alcohol until the third sip. It has that great citrus/pine resiny coating on the back of the tonuge/palatte, a DIPA should have these days. Big beautiful Telly Savalas malt bill. Odd flavor of the beer: a creamy DIPA. Pliny certainly aint creamy. This is a beer I wish I brewed.

 A burnt orange / copper color with little head and lacing. Clear and clean, not much carbonation.
 Sweet malts with the always present grapefruity and pine tones but blended together nicely to make a great smelling brew.
 Fantastic mouthfeel, thick and full ,coated the mouth nicely and left a resin on the lips- nice.
 Great taste ! Drinkability in my opinion is high based on the flavor but this is potent stuff- not an all day affair - drink with care- and of course share only with those who will appreciate this tasty treat! 617 charactersohoove, Nov 20, 2007

4.8/5  rDev +9.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5I got this bottle in a trade with autumnaldave. Thanks Dave!
This pours from 22oz bottle a clear medium gold with a small and fast shrinking head of foam. There's some spotty lacing that hugs the side of my glass.
The smell is huge on the hops with grapefruit and some floral notes and I can just smell a bit of malt hiding in the background.
The taste on first sip....wow, it sure fooled me. Yeah, the hops are what I first noticed and they're powerful and tasty with grapefruit and some pine but the malt holds its own here. Wonderful caramel malty goodness that gives the overall tasting experience a so darn balanced flavour that it leaves me shaking my head. It finishes slightly bitter but the aftertaste leaves a nice malty taste that lingers on for quite some time. And...where the heck is the alcohol?? It's not noticeable in the taste at all and there's just the slightest bit of warming after the swallow. Well done!
It has a medium bordering on full mouthfeel and the carbonation is lightly done. What a sipper! I'm pretty sure that this is the best example of the style I've ever tasted. I've had samples of Dreadnaught at the last couple of GABFs that I attended and thought it was something special. This bottle proves that I was right. Thanks mucho again, Dave, for a most enjoyable drinking experience!
Bottom line: If you like your DIPAs to bring both the hops and the malt to the table, this one is for you! It's an amazing brew!! 1,454 charactersBitterbill, Nov 18, 2007
4.22/5  rDev -3.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Purchased on 3/5/07 at Warehouse Beverage
Pours a cloudy thickish orange/amber color with some white lace pools and sticky ring. Aromas of prune, general tropical fruits, big floral and herbal hops, pineapple, caramel malt, and slight estery alcohol. Hops offers a big herbal spiciness and pine oils that are softer than expected. Citric fruits with a mellowed acidic bite. Burnt caramel, prunes on the tart side, and big sweetness...candied sugar with flashes of honey. Finishes with some larger pine notes, herbals again, spicy, and dry. A nice weight to the mouth on a silky smoothness that leaves a little slickness on the palate. Carbonation diminishes to allow just a nice crispness. Alcohol heat is largely unnoticeable...dangerously drinkable. Some of the bright hop flavor might have been lost in the aging but enough remains and lends to a nice richness and balance. A tad pricey at $11 for a bomber. 910 characterscabsandking, Nov 14, 2007

A: Medium/light amber with a captivating cloudiness. Pours with thick, pure white-lace head.
S: Very impressive. Layers of hops, floral aromas, sweet hop oils, citrus and a malty sweetness.
T: I think what is most impressive about this beer is that even with an insane amount of hops there is still a balancing sweetness that is well delivered with the high alcohol. The finish introduces a citrus flavor along the lines of a mildly sweet grapefruit. Captivating. The 9.5 alcohol content creates a warming sensation that does not quit. An IPA Winter Warmer? You got it.
M: Very smoothe and mouth-filling, oily but light.
D: So much flavor and complexity you will want more but the high alcohol will limit you to a couple.
Best American IPA? Got my vote. Admittedly I am not the biggest fan of IPA style beer but I have to say that if more of them had half of what this beer delivers, I would be. An analogy? Dreadnaught is to other American IPA's as a cup of french press Italian roast coffee is to police station decaf. You have to try this. 1,147 charactersDanGraser, Nov 11, 2007

T: Tastes good, but doesn't seem to be as intense as the aroma. I'll re-evaluate as it warms up a bit. I can taste honey and caramel, piney hop resin, and some bitter citrus. Can't even taste the alcohol.

A  The beer poured a dark, hazy orange color. Not very much head, but that could be because the bottle may be past it's prime. Great lacing.
S  The beer is very aromatic. The fruity hop profile is very evident. I'm getting mango and peach. 
T  The beer has a very malty backbone, which makes sense given the high ABV. This beer is screaming Simcoe, Centennial, and Cascade hops. The taste is very floral. This is most certainly a hopbomb, but it doesn't scream bitterness to me. Nonetheless, I find the taste to be very pleasant.
M  The beer is medium to full bodied. Very rich for a DIPA. 
D  The ABV is very well hidden in the maltiness of the beer. This makes this one very drinkable. However, since it is FFF and I live in California, there are plenty of substitutes for this beer at a much cheaper price and more in line with my idea of what a DIPA tastes like. Nonetheless, this is a solid beer and I definitely recommend trying it, but not giving up an arm and a leg for it. 1,028 characterssessycuban, Nov 08, 2007

Aside from my remaining bottles of Dark Lord, this is the last beer I have from DLD '07. The memories of that day may sway this review a little bit, but I have been nothing but impressed by anything 3F that I've had the pleasure of trying. 
Pours a totally opaque orange to amber color with a feathery white head that sticks around and leaves a ton of lacing on the glass. There is a noticeable amount of pine in the nose, some citrus, and a distinct sweetness. Citrus sweetness and floral bitterness gives way to a balancing sugary sweetness for a very complex flavor. Mouthfeel is thick and syrupy with a good amount of carbonation. This is an excellent DIPA. I could easily drink this all night. Highest recommendation. 756 charactersmontageman, Nov 06, 2007

T: Damn, this is amazing. Incredibly well-balanced for a DIPA. the hops are huge, with tons of citrus flavors dominating the front. A huge caramel malt backbone balances it out wonderfully. The alcohol is present, but barely noticeable. Incredibly balanced.

A: Pours a deep dark orange color with a thin white head.
S: Lots of citrus and floral accents along with a bit of pine.
T: Loads of citrus, most of it sweet in the form of candied fruits. A big sweet caramel malt base to go along with all of the hops. The 9.5% pops up every now and then although it does a decent job of hiding it. This is a big beer in every way: hops, malt, viscosity and alcohol. 
M: A very interesting mouthfeel. It's thick, viscous, creamy, and loaded with slick hop oils. 
D: A very good DIPA, although very different than the west coast varieties that I'm used to. It's definitely a sipper due to the thickness and the alcohol. 716 characterswilljschmidt, Nov 03, 2007

It was delivered in a 12 oz bowtie glass at the FFF brew-pub. Minimal head over a coppery colored beer. Lace nice and pronounced as I drank.
The nose was subdued, but I could get a whiff of the floral/ citrus hops.
The taste: Very Nice! Very pronounced floral/citrus hop blast with a nice caramel malt sweetness to balance this out. Even a diacetal buttery taste to give it some creamyness.
Mouthfeel: Robust, creamy, smooth, rich.... everything I want in a DIPA.
Drinkability: Excellent beer to cap off my evening at FFF. Certainly a sipper.... but fantastic for a DIPA. 623 charactersTheBierBand, Oct 31, 2007

Poured from a bomber into a pint glass.
A. Golden red beer with a frothy head and average lacing.
S. Piney hops with a following of mild sweet malt.
T. Sweet malt with a strong hop taste. Definitely more balanced than I am used to in a DIPA.
M. Think oily brew with mild carbonation.
D. The abv kills the drinkability, but as DIPA's go definitely on the high scale.
I was a little dissapointed with the beer since it was so highly hyped. It is a great beer, but I guess with the score and the hoops I had to jump through to get it, I was expected beer of the gods. Still, a good beer. 746 charactersMarkSCCOT, Oct 28, 2007

A fluffy cream colored head that stood strong for a bit and then made its exit. Sweet caramel malt and some pine scent from the hops touched the nose subtly, nothing overpowers the senses. A nice balance of piney hops and maltiness that was not too sweet, yet very bitter in a good way. Some slight heat from the alcohol, which is barely noticeable. I didn't detect it until the end of my glass. I got that nice warm, relaxed feeling you get when you finish a DIPA. A nice beer that didn't start off all that special but became better as it warmed up a little. Another great offering from Three Floyds. 679 charactersjhammerly, Oct 13, 2007

Smells like floral hops with some malty sweetness. Tastes of floral hops with perfect malt balance. Drinks far more easily than any IPA I've ever said. If not careful, could easily start trying to session this thing. Really, an absolutely fantastic beer. 325 charactersMrThursday, Oct 10, 2007
4.03/5  rDev -8.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 422oz. Bomber from Dilly Deli poured into a pint. No dating.
A: 1finger, yellowish rocky head. Very murky apricot pour. Head dies a little bit then holds some retention. Not much lacing at all.
S: Floral, Piney hops. Not as much spice as I would have expected. Getting some caramel malt sweetness. Hops are there but again, not as much as expected.
T/M: Good balance between a crisp hoppy bite and sweet, nutty, caramel malts. It's actually higher in malts than I expected. Moderate, creamy body.
D: Average drink and pretty tasty. I liked this but it wasn't what I was expecting from such a highly rated DIPA. Price and availability take a away from it a little bit. 670 characterspwoods, Oct 08, 2007
4.8/5  rDev +9.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5This beer represented something of a Damascus Road for me since I was unfamiliar with these high-alcohol IPAs prior to meeting the Dreadnaught at the FFF brewery. The world has never been the same again. Pale mahogany and slightly hazy upon pouring with a modest yet structured head. The (obviously hoppy) aroma is arresting, but the palate is what it is all about. Others have written extensively about it; suffice it to say that, after Dreadnaught, almost all other beer is boring. My only reservation: at $10 a bomber it isn't cheap. 536 charactersAylwinForbes, Sep 30, 2007

A - Poured out a cloudy orange color with flecks of burgandy. It had a small, off-white head that left small traces of lace.
S - It smelled of citrus and orange. Also, a good dose of hops and a sweet kick.
T - It tasted of subtle spices. A nice bitter hop flavor. Also, a good bit of toasted malt.
M - It was crisp and very sharp. A warm alcohol presence. A medium to heavy-bodied beer.
D - This is an excellent beer. Great flavor! 476 characterszeff80, Sep 25, 2007
4.42/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5A- Pours an amber color with a thin head that lingers for quite a while.
S- Smell is very sweet and citrusy with a very subtle hoppy pine aroma in the background.
T- Tastes of caramel, citrus and a slight hoppy bitterness. Extremely well balanced for a DIPA and not nearly as overbearing as I was expecting.
M- Mouthfeel is very thick with a low amount of carbonation. I personally would have liked a little more carbonation but it all seems to balance really well.
D- This is extremely drinkable, delicious and well balanced, couldn't ask for much more from a DIPA. 570 charactersLothore, Sep 25, 2007
4.57/5  rDev +4.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5I've had this one a couple of times but I'm just getting around to a BA style review. 
A vigorous pour only gets about an inch of light tan head. Body is an attractive honey amber hue. Nose is a rich hoppy mouth waterer with citrus, pine, mineral and even some silky vanilla notes laced in. As you first sip this one you get the well developed long rich hop feel that is prestigously unipue. Silky and nicely balanced with long citrus rind and honey. Almost sharp like cheese on the mouthfeel, while leaving a thickness on the buds. Warms the belly well. Delicous long term sipper that is not at all obtrusive. 611 charactersSPLITGRIN, Sep 23, 2007
4.17/5  rDev -5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4A- An aggressive pour only produced a 1 finger creamy white head on this one. The body is a beautiful translucent rusty amber color that is full and vibrant. Head fades rather quickly to a nice collar and some lacing is left behind in the glass.
S- Smell is a big and balanced combination of piny and citrus hops. The piny hops dominate the nose at the end.
T- Upfront is lots of citrus hops and a good dose of piny hops. A whole lot of hop flavor upfront. The finish is a smack in the face of refreshing piny hops with hints of fruity citrus subtly making a presence in the background. What lingers is a big piny hop flavor. The bitterness is definitely present but not strong until a second or third swallow is made after a gulp of this brew. The hop flavor is definitely the main character here.
M- Medium carbonation and big thick oily mouthfeel. Smooth and creamy.
D- This is a pretty darn good DIPA. One that is hard to find and it was definitely a treat for me. The 9.5% ABV is well hidden but takes its effect pretty fast. One I will revisit when I see it again (not available around here-and soon not available in OH either.) My first brew from FFF . I have Rabid Rabbit that I am looking forward to also-but I would like to try others from FFF. 1,258 charactersPittBeerGirl, Sep 20, 2007
4.15/5  rDev -5.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A 650 mL of Dreadnaught that I purchased over a year ago as part of a case. As it has at least a year under its belt, I thought it was worth a re-visit.
A: The ale has an appreciable haze in my tumbler glass, in part because the ale is cold and the glass is not and in part because the 'Naught has some haziness to it to begin with. The ale is still full of vim and vigor, leaving a nice band of lace in the glass.
S: The nose is still full of hops, bitter and astringent, but a pronounced malt body has emerged that reminds me of Devil Dancer or Weyerbacher Eleven. Both of those beers are an intense blend of hops and malts, easily mistakeable for a barleywine. I have the same issue here, the flavors are indistinguishable from a hoppy West Coast barleywine.
T: The malt body is far more pronounced now than in the past but the flavors are not barleywine-esque, which really threw me for a loss. The malt body that emerges is caramel-driven, grainy with an underlying darker sweetness. Don't let initial impressions fool you, the hops are still here and they are still strong. Medicinal amarillo flavors emerge, creating a sharp contrast with the caramel malts. The alcohol is as evident, if not moreso than when the beer is fresh.
M: Even with a year under its belt, this beer is formidable, full of offensive hop bitterness and a huge malt backbone. One of the best DIPAs has easily transitioned to an excellent barleywine.
D: A bomber is more than even, fresh or a year old. The body is full of intense flavors that can easily knock the tastebuds around. Despite the long-term scarring to my taste abilities, I have achieved a certain serenity with this in hand. 1,673 charactersakorsak, Sep 19, 2007

This beer is a cloudy orange with a small head. Not a lot of carbonation. The smell is hop heaven. Probably the best smelling hoppy beer I have ever had. The taste was well balanced with a huge hop presence with a malt sweetness to even it out. Absolutly wonderfull. The mouthfeel is smooth with just a hint of the abv. The drinkability is good as well. I gave this a 4 in that area not to take away from the beer but to remind myself that this beer is almost 10%. I prefer the Alpha King to this for session drinking but this is perfect to split a bomber with a friend. 625 charactersEnola, Sep 09, 2007
4.34/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3 |  overall: 4Ohhh thanks enola. You are the man!!
Pumpkin colored. 1/2" wispy head.
The aroma is amazing! It was hard to pull my nose away from this one. The whole hop gamut fills my olefactory senses. Pine, citrus, floral. It is all there. Floral is probably the most noticable, but not by much.
Huge biscuit malts in the flavor. Huge citrus/piney hops. The floral is more noticable in the aroma than the taste. Huge hoppy beer. WIth that being said I don't think this one really stands out among other top DIPAs I've tried.
The mouthfeel is full bodied. It's as full as most RISs. Also it 's missing the tingling feeling a lot of hoppy beers leave in my mouth.
It's a damn good beer. No doubt about that. 693 characterswcudwight, Sep 09, 2007
4.97/5  rDev +13.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This one is for Michael Jackson. May he drink in peace.
Poured into a Piraat tulip this beer is a hazy vibrant orange-red color which shimmers in the light. The head is only an inch in height. Lacing is thin cap which covers the liquid below. 
The aroma is of grapefruit, citrus, and pine needles. I have experienced all of these aromas before in DIPAs, but this beers has a distinct oddness to it. These aromas are interacting with each other in a completely different way than I have witnessed before. It is hard to discribe. At times it seems competely fruit driven, then seconds later it is completely pine driven. I guess the best way I can think to disrcibe it is as being perfectly round....no, not round. It has too much depth to be just round. It is spherical. All of its elements dominate in their own rite, then step aside to let the others have their turn. The real beauty lies in how there is no set pattern as to which aromas follow each other. It can start out with grapefruit, then become citrus, then grapefruit again, then tumble into pine resin. The next whif can be citrus, then more citrus, then pine, the grapfruit. It simply rolls all over. 
The taste is more structured than the aroma, but equally as complex. Again grapefruit, citrus, and pine. The grapefruit and citrus make an immediate impact, then fade away. Pine shines through the finish, giving way to the grapefruit which re-appears in the long aftertaste. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with a silky texture, and fine, lively carbonation.
Overall, this is a real treat. I enjoy drinking DIPAs, and IPAs, but I usually refrain from saying I love drinking them. This is due to the fact that, while nearly all the examples I have had have been very fun to taste, have lacked any significant complexity, and have failed to create any deep philosophical wonderment. This beer is different. It is by far the most complex DIPA I have yet had the privilege to taste. Could I drink this beer everyday? No, but I would love to drink it once a month. 2,032 charactersKarlHungus, Sep 02, 2007

Im a huge fan of double IPAs and this one has such a malty biscuit-juice like backbone, I was pleased how that layer counterbalances the bitter pine cone grapefruit-esque hops which stand out in the finish. Balance is not an operative word here with the intensity of flavors all around. A bit too much on the tea side with that bittersweet honey biscuit flavor but all around an enjoyable beer. Its also a bit astringent with the overload of hops. Thank you NEPA case split club for this bottle. 546 charactersPAYankeeFan, Sep 01, 2007
4/5  rDev -8.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Pours burnt orange with a milky head. 
Orange, booze, mango, some flowery notes, and pine in the nose. Nothing unique here. 
Really underwhelmed with the hop character-I was hoping for something that would give Pliny a run for its money being rated so highly. Pretty malty upfront that quickly progresses to candied orange, pineapple, and mango flavors. Finishes with pine and floral flavors. Quite bitter.
Not a bad DIPA, just expected a lot more from something that cost 12 dollars for a 22 oz. 499 charactersbosco7, Aug 31, 2007
4.42/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5One of the first big beers I tasted when I first began this quest. Thought I would review now that I am on BeerAdvocate. Pours from the bomber a hazy orange type color with a small white head that stays for a moment and then just simply leaves a small white head on top. Smell is pine hops with some fruits coming through like grapefruit. Taste is all hops with grapefruit and leaving a bittering delicious hop feeling. Mouthfeel is somewhat sticky and allows your palate to concentrate on the bittering hops without too much overpowering carbonation. After sampling lots of other IIPA out there I come home to this one and am thorougly impressed again. 653 charactersgenog, Aug 28, 2007

I popped the cap, or rather tried to, but the opener slipped off after the first "pfft". As I reposition the opener to finish popping the cap I start to laugh - I can already smell it! 
Pours a pretty bright hazy orange, with a light and airy head of nearly white color. Most subsides quickly, but some better than average lacing is left behind.  
What a delicious hoppy aroma, full of grapefruit, pine and a sweeter orange aroma. Note that there is plenty of caramel malt evident here, but frankly it is scarcely worth mentioning compared to the quality of the hop bill here. Alcohol isn't hidden, and I don't mind a bit. Fantastic. 
Tasty, and probably a bit too much so for my own good. Is this beer, or a glass of palate-sticking hop oil? Love the lingering bitterness which is really working my saliva glands. Alcohol shows up even more than in the aroma. Great combination of sweet and bitter, like biting into an orange and getting the juice mixed with the peel. Other than the general perception of sweetness it is difficult to say much about the malt profile. Body is pretty full, but drinkability never overly suffers. Carbonation is restrained, the finish dry, and I'm left enjoying the hop juice sticking to my palate.  
I drank this beer for the first time with a lemon/blueberry cheesecake at the 3F brewpub...this experience fell short of that, but then most experiences in my life fall short of that bliss. It's a bit warming but I opened it on a 94 degree day without a second thought - I'd experience this again in a heartbeat, and fortunately I'm not out yet! 1,602 charactersudubdawg, Aug 28, 2007

Smells of huge hops, piney, grassy and citrus rind along with grapefruit. Taste is a wallop to the buds and I love it. Delicious, power packed hops but as soon as you want to pucker a nice balance of fruit and malt make this an incredible balanced DIPA. Alcohol is not present other than a little warming. Carbonation is perfect as is the medium mouthfeel and crazy drinkability. Finishes a little dry and bitter from the hops but does not sting or linger. If I had access to this I would have it batting cleanup. A must try for any true BA. 601 charactersfranksnbeans, Aug 24, 2007

Three Floyds is known for brewing some great brews so I was very excited to try this one. I was able to share this and some other great brews during a tasting night with two of my good buddies. We saved this for last because we knew our palates would all used up after drinking this famous DIPA.
A--This is an attractive beer. I would term it a "radioactive orange" It is deep and bright, almost peach color.
S--Surprise on this...Hops! Lots of hops for certain. However, you smell a sweet nectar eminating from it also, it is distinct and impressive.
T--This is crazy. I have never tasted an IPA like this in my life. It is very unique in flavor. I cant get past the sweet tones in the palate, it is something you dont get everyday.
M--Non-distinguishable. Not especially smooth or notable.
D--Wild beer. I really liked this one a lot. The only hangup I might have is a had a variety of the finest in the world and by the point I got to this, I was pretty knackered. Might not be 100% fair to this one but still, a must try. 1,173 charactersgarbercury, Aug 14, 2007

Appearance is solid cloudy orange under an ample white head. Head fades to a thin cap and stays. Apparent carbonation. Pretty beer!
Smell is huge: all floral and pine hops over a solid cracker malt and bread-dough base. Mmmm. This smells mighty good.
Taste has a great malty-sweet foundation up front, then hops, hops, hops kick in. Not just bittering hops, but nice floral and piney hops. Good stuff.
Mouthfeel is smooth and nicely slick. Evident hop oils. So smoooth, with notable and fine carbonation.
Drinkability is excellent. So many complex flavors happening here, you palate stays occupied. The alcohol is completely hidden. I never would have guessed this thing is 9.5%.
Another home run by Three Floyds! Well done. 838 charactersColoradoBobs, Aug 05, 2007

A - Pours amurky amber orange, the first pour revealed only the slightest head (even after a vigorous pour) and barely any carbonation bubble, lacing, etc...
- The second pour had a nice 1.5 finger head... it looked like a proper beer 
S - Big earthy hop aroma wiht a hint of pine complemented by a big sweetness.
T - A great tasting DIPA. Of course it has a huge hop presence in the beginning, sweet middle,with a lingering hop bitterness. But there is also a nice nutty presence... toasted almond. As it warms it actually has a drier finish; the sweetness fades slightly, revealing a more hoppy beer, almost a pireceing bitterness ... excellent.
M - Medium bodied, despite the light carbonation. It could be a bit more carbonated ( that might would have brought out moreof the aroma) but it had a nice feel, nonetheless.
D - Despite the huge flavor and the big alcohol punch this is quite drinkable. A very well made beer, balanced but enormous flavor. 1,047 charactersIPAcraig, Aug 02, 2007
4.22/5  rDev -3.9%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Clear orange with a fast-fading head.
Juicy, organic aroma nearly pours off the beer...leafy hops, medium malts, molasses, and something like chicken barbeque.
Taste is huge with leafy and floral hops, succulent malt (for some reason I get a twinge of barbequed poultry again. No food is present to skew my tasting, and it's a good flavor but odd.) Alcohol is readily apparent with a mild sting, and it resonates hop bitterness far into the aftertaste. Some woody, almost oaken notes show up at times as well. Slight saltwater notes as well.
A true ass-kicker of a DIPA, right up there with Southern Tier Unearthly and Stone Ruination. Only hopheads need apply, yet there's a good, complex brew under the monster hops and alcohol. 739 charactersshirfan, Aug 01, 2007

4.72/5  rDev +7.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5A- A beautiful gold liquid fills the glass. It is slightly cloudy, just how I like it. The drawback is the tiny head that formed and then settled to almost nothing- leaving a fairly lonely looking liquid in the glass.
S- Now this is just about right. Some pine (but not harsh at all, this is beautiful), some grapefruit, slightly earthy with a great malt backing. Kind of sweet, but very unique. 
T- Amazing. Just like the smell, but way more intense and complex. Sweet and bitter at the same time, but nothing overwhelms. Very well balanced.
M- Perfect amount of carbonation and lightness on the palate. Not overly cloying, just enough lasting bitterness to let you know what it is going down.

S-Before it hits the lips I smell tremendous hops, orange, and grapefruit that makes you want to dive right in. 
T-it's almost sweet, but the hops hit you before the sweetness sets in. You can taste the obvious hops and they give the beer a unique flavor, but do not overpower the beer. 
M-Once it's in the mouth it is much thicker than the color would suggest. 
D-This is one of the best beers in it's category. Although it has a high ABV it is very drinkable, which makes it a little dangerous. 671 charactersiuhophead87, Jul 18, 2007
4.95/5  rDev +12.8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5I flew to Chicago and drove to Munster, Indiana for this beer. After loading the rent-a-suv, I drove straight home, to Boston with it. 
This I.P.A. Came in a 22oz. Bomber. Once poured (into one of those new engineered Sam Adams glasses) the head is small and disappears quickly. The beer has a fairly floral hop aroma. 
It has a very fruity hop flavor that lingers for a few moments. You will honestly want another gulp and then another glass. It feels a little filling in your mouth with the pops of various fruit and that delicious hops. Once down the hatch you quickly find a beer that isn't as filling as you'd assume. 
I find this beer to be an awesome example of what an IPA should be. Hoppy floral aromas with a fruit/hoppy taste and after taste that doesn't overwhelm. This beer aims to please the hop head with making you feel like you're chewing on hops. Over-all an aweseome beer. Heck I flew to Chicago and drove to the brew pub to buy this stuff. Then drove home 18 straight hours for it. 1,010 charactersRixBeer, Jul 16, 2007
4.57/5  rDev +4.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.522 oz. bomber into a tulip glass.
Out bounces a vibrant, golden-orange colored brew with no carbonation and a thin wisp of white foam up top. Good depth to the color, despite the transparency (there's a lot of light getting through this beer). The aroma is absolutely intoxicating: fresh, piney hops, a touch of ganja, alcohol, sugary molasses, spice, and (of course) tons of grapefruit, tangerine and mango notes. I'd give the smell a 5.5 if I could. 
The taste is decadent as well. There are oily, syrupy notes of resinous hops paired with sweet malted toffee and citrus (lots of grapefruit, again). The alcohol makes an appearance, but not overwhelmingly so. Mouthfeel is very viscous, almost to the point of excessiveness. I enjoyed this beer more when it was cooler (~35 F vs. 45 F). The aftertase is good, but the alcohol seems to play a bigger role than the bitterness of the hops, producing a more pungent feel that I would have liked. This is just a nit-pick, however, as the mouthfeel still ranks highly. Overall, this beer is absolutely drinkable, enjoyable, and complex. The hops burst through, but are not without their complements of sweetened malts and alcoholic overtures. Definitely worth the price tag, and worth searching out again. 1,253 characterswagenvolks, Jul 09, 2007

Citrus and malt aroma, hints of soy sauce and pineapple. Tons of flavor, first taste is hops, then dark caramel, then malt and soy sauce. Thick after taste with less citrus and more something or other, cant really put my tongue on it. It leaves the taste of Fall in the back of my mouth. Could use some more hops, and a little less malt. Not my favorite beer but still one of the most interesting I have ever had. 536 charactersalspaleale, Jul 08, 2007

The beer poured a semi-hazy copper orange with a thin head that slowly diminishes to a ring. The aroma is a strong blend of pine hops and sweet malts. The taste is dominated by an absolutely wonderful blend of hops against a strong malt backbone. Pine dominates but makes way for some undertoned citrus. There is a decent alcohol presence, but it is strongly masked by the beers great taste, making a heavy beer seem lighter than it is, and also making it incredibly easy to drink. 515 charactersatsprings, Jul 01, 2007
4.65/5  rDev +5.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Thanks to Jay23 for this prestigious brew.
This beer falls a hazy pale orange into my snifter, topped with a nice 3 finger head. Incredible lacing and good retention.
Sweet grapefruit, pine sap, biscuity malt, some sweeter citruses like tangerine and orange on the nose.
Hops obviously control the show here, but the range of hop flavors keeps it from being overly one-dimensional. Obviously grapefruit has a strong presence, as well as orange, citrus zest, and maybe even peach. A decent amount of malt futilely fights the whirlwind of hops.
The carbonation really is perfect. I can't imagine a more finely carbonated IPA. I spent about as much time swirling the beer around the glass and watching the cascades of lacing form and dissolve as I did drinking! Mesmerizing stuff. Great brew. 801 charactersillidurit, Jun 27, 2007

Finally time to pop this one open...here goes! 
A - Beer pours out a medium light orange color, completely opaque. Head is bright white and fades to a thick film, thicker in the center. Lacing is medium, 4 or 5 very thick, short patches form around the tulip rim. 
S - Very fragrant scent on this one, a complex twist of malts and hops coming together very sweet, spicy and bitter in the end. Malts are very cereal-like, and there's definitely a hot cayenne pepper like spice in there. 
T - Starts light and sweet with a nice bitterness, thick and chewy. Very quickly comes a hot spiciness, then sugary sweet and grapefruit-like hops. Cereal malts supporting everything in the background. There is a very light warming alcohol which gives it a bit of a barleywine aspect, it's not too overpowering though. 
M - Consistency is actually pretty thick, carbonation is medium to light. Smooth all together. 
D - Overall, I'm definitely satisfied with this beer, I believe it lives up to its rating. My only complaints are that I wanted to see a bigger hop presence but I'm sure if it was fresher, it would be more hoppy. Still though, this is one hell of a beer. 1,224 charactersumustdrink, Jun 27, 2007
3.68/5  rDev -16.2%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4A: Poured from the bottle into a pint glass. The beer is a deep orange with an almost copper appearance. A small white head is present with decent lacing. 
S: Very hoppy in the nose. Pine, citrus are dominant. 
T: It starts off sweet but the hops hit you hard and it is bitter but it seems to fit. I also got some strange taste in the finish, almost a fishy taste. The alcohol is well hidden. A very aggressive beer but in a very good way. 
D: It is a very solid beer but it didn't impress me all the at much. Avery's Maharaja and DFH 90 minute are a cut above this one in my eyes, but still definitely worth a try.
One and a half thumbs up. 653 charactersrobocrouch, Jun 22, 2007

A: Copper Orange with a small head, some tiny bubbles and sticky lacing.
S: A true hop bomb. Pine and Citrus waft from the glass in a big way.
T: Initial sweetness followed by an explosion of the pine and grapefruit of the hops. You can taste the alcohol in this one. This is a big beer, aggressive and in your face.
M: Very thick moutfeel, you can chew on this bad boy.
D: I will stop at one here. It is a very straightforward example of a DIPA, but drinking more than one would put you down for the count.
Overall: Good example of a DIPA. In true 3 Floyd's fashion there is nothing subtle here. They came out swinging for the fences with this one and if not a home run, its at least off with wall with extra bases. Not the bestDIPA/ IPA out there I prefer a few others most noteably Alesmith, DFH 90 but a wonderful brew nonetheless. Get your hands on one, its a true 3 Floyd's experience. 1,000 characterstpd975, Jun 16, 2007

I ended up liking this more than I initially thought I would. I know there is quite a bit of hype surrounding this one, but I typically don't get excited over this sort of beer like your hop-head types do. I wasn't too terribly impressed with its appearance. A fairly aggressive pour with a good bit of distance between the bottle and the glass yielded a very meager head. What foam was there, vanished in about 20 seconds. Smell was exactly where it probably should be with loads of piney, citrusy hops. 
I must admit, the taste was better balanced than I thought it would be, with an assertive, bitter hop profile up front and into the middle, and a nice almost candy sweet maltiness to smooth things out. Very nice, indeed.
I gave drinakability high marks on this one due to the fact that were I to guess the abv having no knowledge of this beer, I would say low 7's, perhaps 7,1, 7,3 something like that. This drinks well below 9,5% for sure. I'm really glad I had the chance to try this one out, and regret I have only two of these, well, one now. 1,123 charactersSilentSabre, Jun 16, 2007

The Dreadnaught pours an orange/copper color with a half inch off-white head. The aroma is very nice, the pine and citrusy (grapefruit) hops are strong, with a bit of malt in there too. Taste is mostly piney hops, with some grapefruit hops and sweet malt noticeable. It starts off a bit sweet, and has a nice hoppy bitter finish. Mouthfeel is very full, and it's also slick, smooth and a bit syrupy. Carbonation is low and the alcohol isn't very noticable which makes this very easy to drink. Overall I think this is a very good beer. If you get the chance to try it, you definitely should. 662 charactersbluejacket74, Jun 16, 2007

3.72/5  rDev -15.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3Been waiting a long time to sample and review this one and finally got a 22 oz. bomber to split with a friend last night. Let's see if this brew is really up to all the hype I've read about it. This sample was a 2006 vintage.
The pour produces a copper colored brew, topped with a foamy, tan head of considerable size, with shrinks to just a thin top which lasts to the bottom of the glass. Holding to the light, the sample is very clear, with only a few tiny bubbles of carbonation rising to the top. Some lacing occurs on the side of the glass.
The nose is HUGE with hops. I repeatedly put my nose into the
top of the glass to try to extract any subtle nuances of a malt character, but to little effect. All you will inhale is hops and more hops (nirvana to a hop head). I was hoping for a little balance, or even a trace of malt in the nose. There is none.
Taste follows the nose in the extreme. The hop flavors are pronounced and in your face. Mostly piney, there is also some grapefruit in the background taste. If you are looking for some maltiness to offset the extreme hoppiness, you won't find any.
Finish is lip-smackingly dry.
Mouthfeel is big and almost chewy. The high ABV is also noticeable, but not entirely objectionable. The beer is what it is ... an American Double IPA, and one has to expect certain characteristics that are typical of the style.
Drinkability is, in my opinion, on the low end of the scale. First of all, this is a huge beer, and should be enjoyed responsibly. The overpowering hoppiness, without a hint of maltiness is, to me, a little bit disappointing. There are many American DIPAs out there which are much more balanced, and more quaffable. My impression is that Three Floyds was just interested in creating a huge 'hop bomb'. In this they succeeded. However, given a choice, I'd enjoy a Ruination or DFH 90 Minute far more than this offering. If you are a fan of the style, it's definitely worth a shot.

A- Perfect double IPA appearance. Slightly hazy orange With three fingers of tight white head that laces beautifully.
S- Wonderful sweet malt with balancing piney aromatic hops that make for a thoroughly enjoyable nose. Equally sweet and bitter, perfectly balanced, and exceptional.
T- Sweet honey-like maltiness up front, with bitter green wood pine hops following quickly, and leaving a wonderful impression on the palette. Not much more than that, but it's so well-balanced and tasty as to be quite possibly the best DIPA I've had.
M- Smooth, creamy, and satisfying. Medium carbonation and a smooth, slightly dry finish that leaves you wanting more.
D- One of the tastiest and most drinkable DIPA's. 830 characterskhiasmus, Jun 04, 2007

22 oz. bomber poured into a tulip glass.
Pours a cloudy burnt orange with a nice fluffy two finger off white head that dies down to a thin layer soon after pour. Lacing is very sticky all over the glass. Smell is a blast of pineapple and fresh pine. Hop dominated scent with a hint of bready malt that tickles the nose. Flavor is definitely not what I had expected. Pretty mild orange/mandarine hop burst at first that is balanced out by a very nice pale malt. Aftertaste is somewhat dry, but not over-dry by any means. By far the smoothest DIPA I have had to date. Full bodied with mild carbonation. Drinkability is scary good, gets even easier to drink as it warms a bit. My first sample from FFF, can't wait to get my hands on some more. Get your hands on this one by any means possible. Give up your first born if necessary. 895 charactersBeerTruth, Jun 03, 2007

Many thanks to Tizzod for sharing this on my Midwest visit.
Pours a dark orange-amber with small head that recedes to a ring with little lacing--typical ADIPA color.
Aroma is a sweet and aromatic hoppy mix, grapefruit and pine, but cooked, mellowed, a hint of funk. Creamy mouthfeel from the high ABV and soft carbonation. 
On the palate there is a sweetness and slight funk that may hint at some poor transport or storage in its history. However the roasted pineapple, smoothly bitter finish balanced by this swetness, and the funk is actually pleasing and complex rather than being a distraction. Other 3F products brought from Chicago showed no spoilage so I can believe that this is the effect the 3F were going for. A mellow, sweet, highly aromatic DIPA that is a nice example of the style. The sweetness and high ABV detract from the drinakbility a tad for me but I usually like IPAs more than DIPAs. 953 characterskenito799, May 29, 2007
4.33/5  rDev -1.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4First and foremost, this is a great beer but I do believe there are better DIPA's out there...I've had a few I thought were better already. 
Pours a dark amber with a near inch thick head and nice carbonation. Sticky lacing after the head dwindles to a thin, staying layer. Smell is somewhat muted and this isn't too cold. Big spicy grapefruit citrus...very interesting for sure but not as strong as many others, though still lovely. Taste is big on juicy citrus hops with a little bitterness but there is still a great use of sweetness and again a little spice with the malts. I don't find it to be overdone on either side, although it is different. I love the mouthfeel of this one. Sticky, creamy, tingly, everything that reminds me of an exceptional DIPA feel. Nice drinkability, this is one that I can handle on almost any day and offers something pretty unique to the world of DIPA's. I probably won't get to try it again any time soon but very recommended and one I'll probably keep on my wants list...

It is bright golden, almost orange with a light, off-white head.
The aroma is quite impressive, hoppy and flowery, very powerful but still quite pleasant, and it lasted throughout this big bottle.
Smooth and creamy, it is, as expected, heavily hopped, but still shows a nice balance as is quite obviously a nice trait of Three Floyds. Hoppy and bitter, it alternates with some maltiness that can even (if rarely) be a little sweetish. Additional flavors include earth/buttery, lots of fruits but almost never a noticeable alcohol.
Very easy to drink, and different than other reviewers suggested, it went nicely on a very hot day.
Keeping in mind I am not a very big fan of hops, this is some brew that deserves many repeats. 801 charactersbrdc, May 21, 2007
4.67/5  rDev +6.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Served at 50 degrees F.
Glowing copper apricot edges around a burnt sienna body. Sticky, smallish, glass-crawling, dirty off-white head. Juicy, resinous, sticky, pungeant, funky, ripe hop aromas mix with equally juicy butterscotch, Juicy Fruit gum, caramel, and cookie malts. Nicely balanced and I really like the Columbus-smelling hop funk. 
Toasted malt leading edge. Juicy, herbally bitter hop flavors quickly emerge. They become funkier and more pungeant and very delicious! Sweet, sticky, fruity malt bursts forth. Pineapple and other tropical fruits with a butterscotch/caramel foundation. Resinous, piney, numbing, delicious bitterness reclaims the finish. Warming, with lingering sugary fruit sweetness and numbing bitterness. Fantastically well balanced and does not disappoint! Full-bodied and syrupy with a gentle creamy feel. Great stuff! Thanks mynie. 870 charactersalexgash, May 20, 2007
3.52/5  rDev -19.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3 |  overall: 2.5An amber, orange beer with a thin head.
Smell is filled with citric fruit, grapefruit and oranges. The malt balances this and gives the beer a sweet, biscuity malt smell.
Taste is bitter, tongue numbing bitter and has strong citric notes of orange zest and grapefruit, not sharp or anything. The hops are also not very aromatic, meaning resinous or piny. 
To balance the high bitterness there is a strong malt backbone, which is sweet and sticky, appears to have a lot of dextrines in there. This really inhibits the drinkability in a strong way. Although this beer is balanced, I feel that either the hops and the malt are overdone, hops are too bitter and malt too sweet and full-bodied. I can't help to think there are better examples of the style that are over the top.
Thanks to dogfooddog for this beer! 819 charactersAbsumaster, May 20, 2007

I am getting sour cherry and grape and a sugary sweetness that is simply perfect. This tastes great.

3.84/5  rDev -12.5%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4It pours a hazy orange with a slightly thick foamy head. Sorry, but I.P.A style beers don't look that great, especially when you compare them to any stout out there. Though, they do look a whole lot better than your average peepee yellow lagers.
Smell is pretty citrusy with no hint of alcohol. Pretty suprising when you consider the high alcohol %. 
Taste starts off like most I.P.A's, but then the high alcohol content kicks in and your mouth starts warming up. The downside to this beer is that it wasn't complex enough for me. It started Citrusy, warmed up, and then became slightly too bitter at the end. It's almost one dimensional, when you compare it to St. Bernardus ABT 12.
Like I said before the alcohol really warms up the mouth, and I prefer that in my beers, as long as it still goes down smooth afterwards, which IMHO this beer did not. 
When it comes to drinkability it's too subjective. I personally would drink this again if someone else bought it. I myself did not like this beer enough to warrant a second purchase. 1,039 charactersBladeRunner, May 15, 2007

The aroma is splendid. Fruity, bitter, and earthy with a blusterous hoppiness. Awesome, with hints of lemon and pine. 
The flavor is that of pure unadulterated hoppy goodness. Bright and bitter with a massive blend of fruit and hops. The finish is a bit sweeter and smooth with notes of pine, lemon, and orange. Fresh and aromatic. 
This beer initially coats the palate with an appetizing bitterness but finishes clean due to a nice tight carbonation. This beer is literally chocked full of flavor. 651 charactersletsgopens, May 11, 2007

Poured a nice deep orange color with a small head forming that left a thin film to hang around.
Aroma- let us see, full-on hops, not pungent but very rich with grapefruit and other citrus notes with a very subtle piney aroma.
Mouthfeel- Great hop bitterness that is intense and then lets the malt come through just a touch before giving a very citrusy-piney finish. Nice thick resinous mouthfeel. I pretty much tasted mostly grapefruit and I thought of Simcoe hops. This was worth the wait and this one is a solid hop bomb! Cheers,

Medium pour in a tulip glass
Recent brewing, braved 05/07
Poured a clear amber orange with a small mostly diminishing white head.
Smelt of strong pineapple and citrus, and moderate caramel, apricot, light banana.
Taste was upfront strong sweet mango apricot and oranges with a bitter grassy and spruce hops followed by a strong bitter moss and dry leaves yeast on a moderate finish.
Palate was creamy, lively carbonated, medium to full bodied lightly cloying and strongly astringent.
Overall, a rich malty sweet IPA loaded with fruit flavors and a generous hop bite. Not a personal favorite though, it was fairly hard to drink a whole bomber. 711 charactersxav33, May 07, 2007

At first smell, a pleasant piney and hoppy sent were notcied. Also, some citrus, lemons and oranges maybe grapefruit. Spicey undertones, caramel, coriander and something meaty, maybe pork?
Nice punch of hops, that is well balanced with the malts. Starts off bitter and finishes sweet with caramel flavors. Alright mouthfeel, decent carbonation. Maybe a little alcoholic. Overall; a well done IIpa, but no five. 581 charactersGraham21, May 07, 2007

There was no hops in the nose; only a sweetness dominated by wet cardboard. The appearance was clear and the head formed nicely but fell too quickly. The flavor had some good hop flavor, pale malt sweetness and pineapple type goodness. But the staleness was prominent and could be tasted around but was still disappointing. Anyways, I am adding this one just to let others know that there are stale bottles of this on the market; so buyer beware.

Served in a 3F imperial pint glass. 
Pours a glowing peachy orange, light haze due to bottle conditioning. Around one or two fingers of bubbly foam that settle to a skim in time. Lace rings the edges. 
Aroma of pineapple, orange marmalade, sweet resiny hops, and pale malt. No hint of harshness, very inviting. 
Hops figure big into the picture, but not to a level that rearranges your face. There's nice balance here, and a fine silky texture to the brew. A low to medium level of viscosity. The understated sweetness of the malt & sugars counter the slight astringency of the load of hops, which makes for a very pleasurable experience. ABV is imperceptible, which could be dangerous.
First thing that hits the palate are the hops, followed by burly malt with a touch of sweetness. Aftertaste is dry and resiny in the back of the throat. 
This is not the intimidating hop bomb that I first pegged it as. It's an approachable Imperial IPA, that deserves it's place in the upper echelon. Also damn tasty, i'll be looking for this on tap during the summer. 1,115 charactersemerge077, May 05, 2007

I'm not that impressed with the appearance. Creamy white head that dissapated quickly with little to no lacing. The color, however, is a really nice golden amber with orange hues. Looks warming.
Huge hoppy smell, grapefruity, citrusy hops. Gets me excited to taste it!
Taste is outrageous, and very much on point for a DIPA. Hop overload, smacks your palate with a HUGE punch at first. Not offensively bitter tho, as it finishes a bit sweeter than I was expecting. The malts hardly balance the huge hops, but they make their presence known with the sweetness at the end. I'd recommend this to every hop head around. Thick but not too thick, and quite properly carbonated. A great beer for chilling out on a spring evening :)
I'd give it a higher drinkability if it were cheaper, and a tad lighter. I've drank half a glass and am already feeling the effects :)
All in all, it's a great beer, if not a little pricey. Worth the hype? I'm willing to buy it again! 1,129 charactersSaucyA, Apr 30, 2007

Nice head and retention, poured into my tulip glass/ 
Smell was malty (caramel mainly) and hoppy. Not that in your face, though.
Taste is malty and hoppy. A little too malty for a double ipa, but balanced nevertheless. I thought this beer was about 8.25% alcohol. Slightly deceiving.
Mouthfeel is decent, clings fairly well, but nothing spectacular.

S--Creamy orange and lychee fruit. I must say that I've never seen lychee fruit used in describing any beer. Perhaps I'm the first? At any rate, I feel rather pretentious for even mentioning such a flavor....
T--Somewhat thick, very hoppy but the hop flavor is interestingly balanced with fruit.

D--Price limits the drinkability....I now realize this is my third review and each time I've criticized the price of the beer. I'm really not some fanatic in this regard, but in these cases I feel it's a strong factor--I can think of one other beer in this style that I like just much, which costs a good deal less. Still, there is no real criticism I can give to this beer otherwise.... 823 characterskundabuffer, Apr 29, 2007

Mouthfeel is excellent. This one sits nicely in the mouth, full and very well rounded. 
Overall, this is an extremely drinkable and well done DIPA. There are others that I prefer in the style, but this is still a top notch beer, and well worth the high ratings that it gets.

5/5  rDev +13.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5this pours a nice, thick, orangey light amber with just a slight haze. just looks big and menacing in that little bowtie at the pub or a tulip at home. off-white creamy, beautiful head and persistent lacing. aromas are huge and upfront, with the citrusy sweet hops (like fresh orange blossoms) dominating along with some fresh bread dough, honey, pine, and floral notes. prominent sweetness at the beginning is eventually overtaken by the huge, but smooth hop bitterness in this beer. absolutely refined and not in any way rough around the edges like some other ipa's or dipa's. balance is superb. super long finish, only at the end of which is the faint warming alcohol (hidden in the aroma and taste)kick noticeable. huge bodied and viscous. dangerously drinkable. the best dipa i've had, hands down. note: i have had a light-struck bottle or two wherein some fishy aromas have developed. make sure it's fresh and not light-struck...just go to the brewery if possible.
i've had many special moments with this beer and could go on and on. 1,039 charactersMrMcGibblets, Apr 16, 2007
4.22/5  rDev -3.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Dreadnaught proves, to my delight, that the West Coast does not have a monopoly on the DIPA style.
Pours a slightly hazy deep orange. Minimal head that vanishes quickly. Aroma a very thick, rich sweet grapefruit. I had an Alpha King before this, but this is something entirely richer.
Taste follows perfectly, and perfectly to style. Juicy fresh hops are the star, but there's an appropriately thick base of sweet malt. Silky and dense, but not viscous. Finishes bitter.
This is a huge beer, but ultimately not unbalanced. It's not easy to create something of this level of quality. 
I find most DIPAs just too much of too many good things, and Dreadnaught is no exception, but this one ranks with the best of what California produces. Although California's top DIPAs retail at $5 a bomber, not $10 like Dreadnaught... 830 charactersTalisker, Apr 11, 2007
4.68/5  rDev +6.6%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A - Poured an extremely hazy, and nealy opaque orange. A huge white pillow like frothy head on top did not want to fade, eventually it relented 	leaving behing a ton of white lace dripping down the glass.	
S - Hops Hops and more hops. The smell was just wonderful. Lots of citrus flavors, heavy hints at orange, pineapple and grapefruit with just the slightest hint at some sugar, very nice indeed.
M & T - Wow is all I can say about that. The bitter hops hit you up close and personal and in a big way. Sweet orange flavors gave way to a nice bitter pineapple front. Small hint at the alcohol hear and a nice dry finish. Very smooth, like silk and very easy going down. Big full flavor and feel. Very nice indeed.
D - Overall this was awesome and definatly a winner. I enjoyed every sip. I truly love big hoppy IPA and this did not let me down. I must get more as I could drink this every night. 905 charactersmikesgroove, Apr 05, 2007

s - as soon as i opened it i smelled hints of bubblegum. mostly this smelled of piney hops.
t - pine, grass and grapefruit. very hoppy, not as well-balanced as i would have liked but the hops do what they intend to do.
m - light to medium mouthfeel, sticky on the tongue.

4.12/5  rDev -6.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4The beer pours a deep gold color, almost amber, and sitting atop the beer is a slightly off white head that leaves decent lacing. Inside the beer there is a continuous flow of carbonation bubbles flowing from the bottom of the beer. The aroma is bitter American hops reminding me of something citrusy. Also present in the nose is a sweet fruity malt backbone. In the taste the hops become more present with a red grapefruit flavor the over powers everything. The malt trying not to be out done, but fails at this, brings out a strong backbone behind the malts giving it a sweeter taste. It is a big beer that leaves a long dry finish that begs you to take another drink, one of my personal favorite beers. 705 characterscproioi, Apr 03, 2007
4.43/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a dark copper. First glass has no foam, second glass has 1 finger. Very minimal lacing. Aroma is predominantly sweet malts with plenty of hops behind it. Pine hops slightly overpower the citrus and floral, but it's a nice blend. Taste is hard to pin down. The sweet malts blend nicely with the hops. The interesting hop blend is not as aggressive as I would expect from 3Fs. Not too sweet, which is my primary complaint in the genre. Very easy to drink by DIPA standards. Mouthfeel is creamy and does not get syrupy. If this were $6 instead of $11 for a 22oz it would be a no-brainer. 590 charactersDuster72, Mar 31, 2007
4.25/5  rDev -3.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Dreadnaught pours an amber color with a slightly off white head. It has a sweet aroma that isn't as full as hops as I would have assumed. There are some hop aromas, but it is mostly malty sweet aromas. The taste is similar to the aroma. There is no blast of hops that I would expect from a double IPA. There is a very strong sweet malty taste and enough hops to balance and stand out, but again, they don't dominate the flavor. I think that I'm getting more accustomed to hoppier beers, so it might be a bit before I can get a stable base to review from. That being said, it is still a good beer. It tastes fairly full bodied for a lighter beer, and is pretty good to drink. I would definitely drink it again.
Edit: On the second half of the bottle as it warmed up, it got hoppier and got better. 799 charactersdrseamus, Mar 29, 2007
4.28/5  rDev -2.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Thanks to dhchatfield for the chance to try this one.
Poured into a goblet for the first time trying this. Great looking after pour but didn't all fit into goblet, so it's broken down into 2 pours. The first pour yielded little to no head and hardly any rising carbonation. No sediment or haze either. The last of the bottle was different story because it contained the yeast from bottle conditioning. The second half had a one-finger white head and haze suspended in the beer. First smells are immediate with a sweet juicy grapefruit smell along with some piney hops in the background. Kept picking out more floral hop smells also. Very surprising and complex. Taste started off with sweet juicy malts switching to fruity and bitter hoppiness. Long and drying bitterness that is also sweet. Almost like a champagne effect with of course better flavors. Slick and oily mouthfeel and decent carbonation feel. A slight booziness comes out as it warms but is otherwise well-hidden. If I had this all of the time, I would have drank it faster, but that's not the case here. Great drinkability and intruiging balance between hops and maltiness. A lot of DIPAs in my opinion come off as too malty. This one IMO is spot on. 1,219 charactersvwcraig, Mar 29, 2007
4.85/5  rDev +10.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A very big thanks to Westsidethreat for this gem of a brew!
A 22oz. brown bomber with a colorful (psychedelic) label and bottlecap, as well as a bottling code printed on the bottom. It pours out a brilliant orange-amber with a dense white head of 1/2" that doesn't last very long.
The smell is spicy and sweet of malt with some serious hops breaking through in a big way...citrus and some pine, with a black pekoe/orange tea seeping through as it warms...smell's great.
The flavor on the otherhand is quite exceptional...lots of sweet navel orange, grapefruit, black tea, pine needles to name some. This is an IPA that is un-surpassed in every way...the hops are aplenty but not overbearing in any way...absolutely and awesomely delicious.
Big body, big beautiful flavor...it just doesn't get any better than this for the style. And drinkable...is it ever!!!
Great stuff FFF's ! 893 charactersscottoale, Mar 23, 2007
4.45/5  rDev +1.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Bomber with standard cool Three Floyds art. Now if they could just start putting dates on the bottles...
Pours hazy dark amber into my tulip glass. Lively, frenetic carbonation races up the glass form the bottom forming a sizeable white head, which settles out into a thin ring of big bubbles. Lacing out the ass. Very nice.
The smell? Gobs of hops-- floral, citric, pine sap-- Three Floyds somehow managed to blend every conceivable hop note into one amalgam of aromatic goodness. There's some light malt, and some more exotic, tropical hops that I can't quite pin down. 
OK, this is it. This is the best DIPA I've ever tasted. Mellow malts and honey, with a bite of bitterness the swells up mid-palate and hangs on for days. Refreshing hop flavors stick around from start to finish, complementing and even calming the bitterness. I've never had an IPA that was so totally defined by its flavor hopping before.
The mouthfeel, like the taste, is silky smooth and slippery, with very light carbonation. Six sips in, and I've already pretty much caved to the urge to slosh it around in my mouth.
This beer is pure hoppy hedonism. Everything is working here.
It's extremely drinkable, and the nine and half points of alcohol are totally undetectable. Still, there's something about this beer (and it's definitely not bitterness) that lends it to slow sipping. Maybe it's the spectacular flavor profile, maybe it's the aroma; I don't know, and with a beer this good, it's hard to ask too many questions. 1,517 characterskajerm, Mar 23, 2007
4.15/5  rDev -5.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Light orange color with a subtle golden context. Small slow developing pure white head dissipated rapidly. Only a meager few carbonation bubbles rise to the top. Thin lacing clings in rings around glass.
Extremely aromatic hops aroma. Grapefruit presence is subtle. An upfront alcohol scent helps warm the nose, but overpowers the subtlety of the citric aromas. 
Taste is strong with a pine flavor. Definitely a strongly hopped flavor. There is a gritty quality to the taste. Very faint fruitiness is hidden behind the hops overload. 
Feels thick on the tongue, and clings to the sides of the mouth. Only a small amount of carbonation lets the taste hold.
Very nice beer. This one would be great with a plate of hot wings. One note to be careful with the alcohol content, it can sneak up on you quickly. Definitely worth hunting down. 846 charactersRedChrome, Mar 21, 2007

The bitterness of three compliment each other well. Taste starts hoppy and bitter and finishes a bit sweet and malty. Very enjoyable. Mouth is dry and crisp, with a crisp alcohol kick. Drinkability is outstanding, a great DIPA. 340 characterscrayphish, Mar 18, 2007
4.3/5  rDev -2.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Bottle acquired from Viggo and shared with Fisherman34 for the MB DIPA throwdown. Much thanks Viggo for this tasty hop bomb treat! Pours out a solid dark amber. Decent head a lacing. Aroma was more about the malts than expected. For the rep of this beer, I feared that my nose hairs would burn off sniffing this sucker. Taste is beautiful blast of citrus hops with a heavy creamy toasty malt backbone. Very creamy indeed and had a great finish to it. I can only imagine what it would be like fresh from the brewery. No astringency noted and the alcohol was well hidden. Fantastic brew and was almost more balanced than I thought going into it. It was a flavour explosion on an otherwise dull March Saturday. Best of show in the throwdown. 738 charactersoakbluff, Mar 18, 2007
4.65/5  rDev +5.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Sampled on-tap on St. Patrick's Day at the Brewhouse Grille.
A - Pours a cloudy orangish/golden color with a 1-inch, off-white head; good retention.
S - Citrus hops with some hints of malt & alcohol...doesn't smell overly hoppy - in the sense where they strip your taste buds - but the hop presence is definitely there.
T - Exceptional taste combinations working together, and a strong, bitter finish with a lingering flavor of grapefruit is your reward. Malt isn't overly sweet...rather it comes off as the toasted variety with some earthy tones. Citrus backbone to the hops...predominantly grapefruit and lemon. And in regards to the hops...they aren't over-the-edge in bitterness. All the flavors work tremedously together for an amazing beer.
M - Creamy, medium body with strong carbonation and an excellent bitter finish.
D - Excellent DIPA...not too sweet, not overly hopped-up...just the perfect balance. 926 charactersJohnnyM2002, Mar 18, 2007

A---It poured a golden copper with little to no head.
S---Caramelized fruit, floral and citrus hop aroma.
T---Malt sweetness upfront. Bitterness starts off smooth and gradually becomes more aggressive with warming alcohol and spicy malt. Finished with a delicious citrus hop flavor.
M---Full bodied but lacking carbonation.

3.5/5  rDev -20.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 2 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4A - big white creamy head that doesn't stick around for long but leaves nice lace behind. Good clarity and beautiful orange, copper color.
S - Grapefruit hop aroma, grassy, chemical/ solvent aroma (reminds me of bugspray?) and a little bit of caramel
T - begins surprisingly malty, with significant alcoholic sweetness. Develops a solid hop bitterness with some spicy notes and carbonized, burnt flavors in the finish.
M - Smooth and slightly mouth coating, a little lingering astringency.
D - Fairly drinkable for an intentionally over the top I2PA. In the end it is difficult to want more than one of these, especially when you are paying attention to the aroma (for me it really brings out some of the more undesireable aspects of American high alpha hops). 772 charactersnickfl, Mar 15, 2007
4.92/5  rDev +12.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5I remember the first time I had a Dreadnaught. It was at a slip-n-slide party where everyone was running around in the end of a hot August in bathing suits with water guns and beers. And I had this. This masterpiece of IPAs. I used to hate IPAs. They are an acquired taste. Or maybe you just need the right IPA to turn your fancy. This was The One. The gateway IPA. The IPA that opened the door to all other IPAs to come.
Ok enough. I love it. Dreadnaught is awesome and since then I haven't disrespected it by drinking it from the bottle at drunken parties. It pours a deep golden/reddish/brown color with lots of carbonation. It has an extremely complex flowery/fruity/hopsy smell to it that just continues to complex in the taste. And 9.5%? Really? I couldn't tell, except for the buzz factor. It's brilliant. Way to go, Three Floyds. 840 characterskdoc8, Mar 13, 2007
4.72/5  rDev +7.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5This beer is light and refreshing with abundant and delicious citrus notes, but at the same time packs a big hop wallop. Dreadnought lives in its own place on the beer landscape, as it closely walks the yin-yang line between certain attributes. It is both extremely light and bitter/heavy, it is very sessionable yet satisfying, and is drinkable yet strong. This beer can be wonderful, my only complaint is that over a handful of times I've had this beer, it's character (or quality? or age?) has been extremely inconsistent. The bottle I had the other day was delightful and everything good I remember about this brand from the first time I had it (on-tap at Three Floyd's). But I've also had bottles of this that are extremely malty and stale. The bad bottles I've had are made worse by the hefty price tag ($10 for a big bottle) this beer frequently carries.
Buy it when you believe it's fresh, as it is an awesome beer then. Avoid it if you see any signs of age. 969 charactersBeerBelcher, Mar 12, 2007
3.97/5  rDev -9.6%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Picked up a bottle at Chuck's Wine & Liquor in Chagrin Falls, OH.
A: Copper hue. Thin wispy off white head. No visible carbonation. Clear but not particularly brilliant.
S: Deep and pronounced grapefruit hop aroma underscored by a slight malt background. A little bit of perceptible alcohol as well. 
T: Big hoppy flavor that is thick and rich. Hop flavor is complex with grapefruit/sharp citrus characteristics. Malt background is detectable and manages to compliment hop onslaught. Bitter aftertaste. 
MF: Medium mouthfeel. Beer is nice thick or viscous. Nice and filling. No perceptible alcohol warming. Pretty low carbonation.
D: This is great version of an imperial IPA. More so than other imperials I think Dreadnaught lets the hops stand on their own and doesn't let an overly cloying sweet malt flavor get in the way. Very drinkable due in part to lack of perceptible alcohol.

4.58/5  rDev +4.3%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5This was as good as advertised, and one of the more complex beers Ive had. Started out pouring from the bottle to a bright orange-red, with thick off-white head that stayed around for the entire glass, and excellent lacing. Initial aroma was strongly hoppy citrus, mainly grapefruit and oranges. However, as the beer warmed, the aroma became more influenced by a malty sweet aroma. Likewise, the flavor, which started out heavily on the bitter, hoppy citrus side, while retaining that throughout, became nicely blended with a malty sweet syrupy taste. Alcohol also made itself more known as the beer warmed, perfectly complementing the hops and malts.
Finally, the finish was lterally a bittersweet blend of hops and malts, with an overall warming sensation from the 9.5% abv. 781 characterskimcgolf, Mar 11, 2007
3.29/5  rDev -25.1%look: 3 | smell: 4 | taste: 3 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3Pours an orange, cloudy color with minimal head. Smell was overwhelmingly hops, with mostly citrus and some vegetable-like characteristics. Taste was a blast of bitterness at the start with some vegetable flavors mixed in and a sweet finish. Thought it was too sweet and that it did not blend well with the hop flavors. Full-bodied and fairly drinkable. Prefer 3Fs Alpha King over this brew and think it is a much tastier and drinkable brew. 441 charactersjhu1995, Mar 03, 2007
4.26/5  rDev -3%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 422 oz bottle thanks to Nflmvp. I shared this with a good friend and poured into two pint glasses. The color was a bright orange and hazy. The head was white and fluffy. The smell was faint but my sense of smell sucks most days. The taste was pretty damn awesome. I definitely tasted the simcoes in there. Pine and citrus are of course present. This was a really awesome brew but totally NOT worth $10. They need to drop that down to around 6~7. I can't get it here anyway but the price is ridiculous. Oh well, I had wanted to have a glass since i first sampled this at GABF. 574 charactersArrogantB, Mar 02, 2007
4.84/5  rDev +10.3%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5(2006 version) poured from a 22oz bomber into a snifter glass
A: Looks like many top-quality DIPAs should look, a deep orange rust color, very clouded or murky. You won't be reading a book while peering through this beer. Very little head but nice oily lacing.
S: Oh so complex! Some mouth-watering malted bread scents meld beautifully with citrusy and perfumy-like floral hops. I even detect some notes of vanilla and peach. Sweet but not cloyingingly so.
T/M: Amazingly well-balanced double IPA, delicious mixture of fruity citrus & moderately toasted malts; VERY bitter grapefruit finish, massive hops, lingers a long time; slightly syrupy, but just enough carbonation to make it easy to take larger sips; damned near perfect.
D: If this wasn't bomber-only, and 9.5% ABV, I'd request a Dreadnaught transfusion instead of blood. But alas, it's not, so I'll just drink as much of it as I can. :-)
Highly recommended, a stalwart of the style. 957 charactersmarkgugs, Mar 02, 2007
4.62/5  rDev +5.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Bomber purchased at Printer's Row Wine Shop in Chicago ($12), and flown down to Mobile by a friend over Christmas. I've been waiting to drink this since, and feel that I better go ahead and do it.
When poured into snifter, there is a faint head, which fades less than a minute into some pockets of bubbles on the surface. Color is a beautiful red-orange, slightly cloudy due to it being bottle-conditioned.
The aroma is a strong one- a cornucopia of hops- piney, fruity, and citrusy. There is a faint syrupy sweetness in the smell as well, to balance things out. You could probably market this aroma to an air freshener company, I absolutely love it! The taste brings out everything I have just smelled- the fruity hops come up front, and the bitter finish initially is of grapefruit and piney hops, although as it warms it took a sweeter, more orange flavor, with some of the piney hoppiness still lingering. The malt backbone whispers in the background to provide a sweetness to all of the different hop flavors, and makes everything most enjoyable. It becomes more noticeable as the beer warms, as well.
On the initial taste there is a bit of medium carbonation, most noticeable on the front of the tongue, with the bitter finish (and perhaps the alcohol, the flavor of which well-masked) leaving behind a numbness and a warming effect that lingers. The beer has a slick viscosity.
I have never found a more enjoyable double IPA, ever, and although the beer was very filling, I could probably take another bomber right now. I can't wait to have this again. 1,571 charactersllitsua, Mar 01, 2007

Pours a perfectly clear golden amber with a slight head. Smell is sweet: strawberry, rasberry and orange. Also, some alcohol but not overbearing. Taste is sweet almost like bubble gum flavor alongside fruity hops, good balance with enough maltiness to counter the hops. A hoppy bitterness followed by a nice malty finish. I could drink this all day but I really couldn't. Wish this one was available in my area as I would also keep a couple available. 606 charactersWeymouthMike, Feb 28, 2007
4.42/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.522oz. bomber
Hazy, burnt orange in color. Large, rocky, ivory head.
Aroma was mainly grapefruit. Crackers, caramel and peaches showed flashes in a sea of grapefruit juice.
A very hoppy beer! Grapefruit, grass and pine. Sweetness was a mix of bubblegum and sugared grapefruit. Wheat bread with honey. Touch of alcohol (less than expected from ABV). Other fruit flavors included orange and peach.
Medium+ in body. Medium carbonation. Just a bit drying. Alcohol warming starts pretty quickly.
An excellent DIPA. I had it a while ago and didn't remember how good it was. This one has about 1 year of age on it, and it's very hoppy. I am going to have to have to grab a fresh one on my next trip to Chicago. 717 characters, Feb 27, 2007

We split a bomber of the Dreadnaught amongst four of us. Served in pint glasses. Pours a slightly hazy pale orange. Medium head. Great retention on it. Smells of plenty o' hops, orange, cinnamon, clove. Taste centers around hops like crazy, but there are some nice sweet, caramel flavors as well. Overall, a great balance to the flavors - I love that in IPA's. Medium mouthfeel - perfect complement to the hoppiness. Overall, an excellent beer. Fine example of the style, and wonderful to take in with friends. 589 charactersndekke39, Feb 20, 2007

Smell: Very floral scent initially followed by a wave of citrus (orange and grapefruit) and very piney hops. 
Taste: This is a glorious beer. It seems somewhat lightly carbonated. Citrus notes are easily detectable, which blend very well with the hops going down the hatch. Fantastic. Easily one of the three best DIPAs I've had.
Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Very light and smooth beer. Easily drinkable at nearly 10%. Too easy. I could drink two or three of these bombers and be a happy man. Overall, fantastic beer. Definitely worth the pricey $10 I paid for the bomber. Highly recommended. 717 charactersprototypic, Feb 18, 2007
4.39/5  rDev 0%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5edit: thanks to jwaks for this bottle
A - this DIPA pours a light hazy brown atop which sits a full finger of rocky off-white head, scant and tiny bubbles of carbonation stream upwards, and as an additional surprise, there is plenty of sediment throughout
S - wow, what a poignant aroma, strong floral-piney aroma, with a citrusy grapefruit hint very evident, lingering in the back is a soapy characteristic as well
T - mellow at first, with a slight sweetness up front, then a hopsplosion, a burst of floral, clover-like, flavor with the additional piney citrusy elements, with a flavorful rather sweetish well balanced flavor
M&D - extremely mellow and smooth, especially for a DIPA, very easy down and highly drinkable, the only detractors are the high IBU's (but most are neutralized by the perfect balancing and blending) and the highish ABV, otherwise this is the perfect IPA, up there with 120 min 916 characterssinstaineddemon, Feb 10, 2007
4.84/5  rDev +10.3%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Got this while in Indy for Xmas and shipped it back to Texas. Poured from a 650ml bomber with no dating system into my New Belgium snifter. Even with a good pour there was barely any head and what was there went away pretty quick. Several of the other reviews I read talked about a nice size head so not sure how fresh this one is but here it goes. It was a copper color with a few pieces of yeast floating around. It was mostly clear until the final pour when more yeast got in there and clouded it up some. The smell was out of this world. Pure smack in the face hops. I'd had several of this style lately and this is top 2 in smell. The taste was also tremendous. The hops attack the palette and have you begging for mercy but in a good way. Since it is intense this is best suited for a nice long drinking session instead of a quick thirst quencher. Again top of the style for me. The mouthfeel again hits a 5 with a nice smooth and creamy texture. Overall this is a exceptional beer and worthy of the high rankings. You must find this beer and try it. You won't be disappointed.

Aroma had bright citrus and pine elements. Apricot, orange, honey and grapefruit flavors emerge. Full body with a medium-high carbonation level.
The first thing that stands out in Dreadnaught is that 3Floyds signature aroma. Most of the FFF beers have it, and that's a good thing. In Dreadnaught, it is turned up to 11. Everything about this brew is kicked up a notch, but it still is remarkably balanced and drinkable. I'm a little sad that I don't have more. 555 charactersfrazbri, Feb 07, 2007

-Poured a golden copper color that was slightly hazy. 
-Nice 1/4 off-white head that didn't stick around very long. 
-Smells of citrus and piney hops, medium mouthfeel with just the right amount of carbonation. 
-Tastes of mild grapefruit and light alcohol that lingers a little while, which is a good thing. 
-Definately worth a try if you can find the 22 oz bomber. 409 charactersJDK, Feb 06, 2007
4.57/5  rDev +4.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Note to self...back-to-back with Southern Tier UnEarthly
3FD is lighter in color and the head poured with less character than STU. 3FD was clear, active and quite effervescent. 3FD smelled less of citrus and more of fruit. The 3FD mouth & taste were smoother, yet had less hoppy character. 3FD is 9.50% vs ST U @ 11%. 3FD scored higher for me in "drink-ability".
---
UnEarthly poured a ruby orange color with a thick off white head with decent hang-time and solid lacing. Clear with little observable effervescence. A big citrusy floral nose of hops. Taste of fresh hops and a sweet pine. A creamy thick mouthfeel that really complements the flavor. The hop taste lingers but it not overwhelming. An 11%-Sleeper that i find very easy to drink. 748 charactersjjayjaye, Feb 03, 2007
3.08/5  rDev -29.8%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 2.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3Well that was interesting. That was my thought after my very first forey into DIPA's. Never has my tongue felt the way it did while drinking this brew...well except that one night in Austin, but I digress. The appearance of this beer is nice enough, a yellow/orange hue with about a half finger head on it. Upon first whiff, my olfactory senses were cranking with the aroma of a whole lotta citrus, oranges to specific. And wow, could you smell the hops! The taste of this beer, as stated before, was a crazy. It numbs the back of your tongue with an overpowering (naturally) hopped up taste. It is also very bitter. I'm not ashamed to say the first few sips were on par with witnessing Rosie O'Donnell in a bikini. It was that rough. However, after the opening stanza of sips, the orange and citrus flavor started to creep up and neutralize the bitterness a little. As I said, in the mouth, it definitely sticks on the tongue and provides a unique feel. As far as drinkability goes, well, I drank it. Can't say how many more times I will though. Definitely not something I could sit down and have a few of, but definitely something to break out every once in a while. Once you get paste the first few sips, if you get past the first fews sips, the taste and sensation get a better and become part of the norm. Try this beer for the experience alone and try to forget about Rosie and her bikini. 1,395 charactersInfamous7100, Feb 02, 2007

 A nice orange/red color witha small head. Nose is grapefruit and flowery hops. Lots of citrusey-ness. Taste is piney/flowery hops and some nice citrus hints. ABV very well hidden. Mouthfeel is great, and so is drinkability. One of the better DIPAs out there. 308 charactersshivtim, Jan 28, 2007
4.41/5  rDev +0.5%look: 3 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a hazed golden copper. Creamy one finger head showing decent retention and producing minimal lacing. The first whiff is of sticky cannabis buds. As it warms, aromas of peach skin, grapefruit rind, floral citrus, and fresh cut grass blend together to form a corniacopia of american hop madness. Also detectable behind the hops is a toasty malt aroma and faint buiscuity notes. The flavor is sweet at first, with caramel, pale malt, and a subdued nutty flavor. Then an onslaught of herbal, minty, and pine hop flavors. The Aftertaste eventually dries, with a peachy/orange taste lingering and a sharp alpha acid sting that only true hop-heads could call "balance". The body is medium-full, and a fine, slow-moving carbonation keeps the mouthfeel fliud enough to allow ease of consumption, while qualifying the syrupy viscosity expected of DIPA's and Barleywines. Finshes with substantial residual toasted malt character and a myraid of american hop complexity to match. A real eye-opener as to what a DIPA can be. 1,017 charactersPBRstreetgang, Jan 28, 2007
4.22/5  rDev -3.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Presentation: A 22oz bottle with no freshness date to be found.
Appearance: A nice orange in colour brew with a thin white lace that does an excellent job of sticking to the glass.
Smell: A massive whiff of fresh hops. With hints of pine and citric overtures.
Taste: From the second I sipped this brew your tongue is hit with the massive hop bitterness that makes this IPA great. The sweetness does come sneaking up from the Back of your tongue. The higher alcohol content does not interfere with the taste at all but does give you a nice warm feeling.
Mouth-Feel: A light carbonation with a nice smooth feeling that finishes nice and bitter.
Drink-Ability: A great IPA that I think is the best one out there by far. 731 charactersmnesporov, Jan 26, 2007

Golden amber in appearance with a slight haze. The amber color really shows through in the right light. Beautiful
Smell is piney hops with some sweetness getting through. Slight aroma of apples and oranges as well.
Taste is all hops. Leaning heavily toward the bitter end. Grapefruit after. Proper DIPA
Mouthfeel is slick, oily hop resins
Drinkability is good, but not quite sessionable. This beer is heavy and filling. I would consider this a special occasion beer.
This is a delicious beverage and I definitely recommend it, even for the $9 price tag in OH. 615 charactersDaehpoh, Jan 26, 2007
3.99/5  rDev -9.1%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4I've recently acquired quite an appreciation for big IPAs and just had to try one of the best there is out there.
APPEARANCE: Pours a beautiful orange straw color with a small white head which lingers momentarily, but subsides to a small ring around the glass with patches of light lacing.
SMELL: The moment I cracked the cap, a rush of piny hop aromas came rushing at me. A full whiff yields strong citrus notes with pine and grass playing backup, and even some hints of a wonderfully sweet maltiness.
TASTE: The first splash on your tongue assaults it with an amazing rush of hop bitterness and sweet alcohol. The selection of hops is absolutely perfect, and the bitterness is strong without being offensive at all. The finish is surprisingly clean with slight lingering alcoholic notes and, of course, some residual hop flavor. This beer has a strange sweetness to it which I did not expect. Some of it seems to come from the wonderful flavors of the hops, but I think a small portion of the sweetness is misplaced. It doesn't take away from the overall taste of the beer. It just seems like the flavors are not characteristic of malt, but of some other sweetness-adding ingredient. A minor nitpick, however, in what is a phenomenal brew.
MOUTHFEEL: Thick and syrupy, with an appropriate amount of carbonation. Coats the entire mouth with each sip.
DRINKABILITY: Quite good. It's amazing how easy it goes down despite the "doubleness" of this beer. Another bomber of this would not be out of the question.
My first beer from Three Floyds did not disappoint. The most striking thing about this beer was how easy drinking it was. Any harshness is completely nonexistent leaving a very smooth beer which hides its 9.5% ABV very well. Get this if you can find it! 1,768 charactersjmalex, Jan 21, 2007
4.64/5  rDev +5.7%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from bomber into my Dogfish pint glass.
Pours a hazy ruby/light brown color with almost no head at all. Slight rings of lace around the top of the glass.
Smell is hops. Juicy, citrusy, piney and floral! This is really a very good smelling beer. The smell itself lets me know that I've got something good here.
Taste is incredible. Everything one should look for in a DIPA and then some. It slams your tastebuds with a wide array of hops and a slight alcohol sense. With a pretty bitter taste coming through midway to the end. It all finishes clean and juicy, making you reach for the glass wanting another drink.
Mouthfeel is is perfect. Not too thick, not too thin. Just right. A good amount of carbonation and malt to balance this out. I was expecting a really bitter overly hopped beer. But this is really balanced and very, very good.
I don't think I would want to drink more than a bomber of this in a sitting. I'm quickly becoming a bigger fan of Three Floyd's with every beer I try. If you haven't tried this one, you haven't had the best DIPA yet. 1,067 charactersFtownThrowDown, Jan 20, 2007
4.82/5  rDev +9.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to a friend, Nic, I finally got to try this beer!
Appearance: Poured very orange in color, with a white head that was short lived. Much clearer than I expected after reading the bottle about the haze. 
Smell: The aroma was very strong, even from the bottle. I was surprised to find the aroma a good mix of my favorite IPA smells, floral, citrusy, and piney. Amazing hop aroma. 
Taste: The hops are definitely in control in the taste, as one would expect. The citrusy of the hops is dominant but I am still getting a piney taste as well. The beer shows its malt well and helps bring some balance to the beer, especially as it warms. I have to say, this is a perfectly tasting DIPA. 
Mouthfeel: medium/thick in body, but certainly nothing overwhelming. 
Drinkability: For the amazing taste, this beer for me is highly drinkable, I really wish it was available here in VA. Absolutely one of the very best DIPA's I have ever had. 947 characterstattooedtolley, Jan 17, 2007

Smells a bit sweet and malty with a strange funky odor that might be yeast. This isn't the hop bomb I thought it would be, it seems more balanced with a bit of sweet malt at first and a slight hop bitterness towards the end. I also taste alot of yeast in this brew and it seems to hide the hops and give it a thick feel. Overall I would have to say that its easy to drink but doesn't seem to fit the style (double IPA) so much. I'll try this one again if I can find it. 564 charactersAlkey, Jan 16, 2007
4.84/5  rDev +10.3%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.522 ounce bottle from the glorious Lone Hill Liquor in Glendora, CA (A good 50 miles away from me). The guys in front of me bought a case of Miller Lite for just over half the price. I think I got a better deal.
Appearance: The pour is a fiery orange with a small white head that almost covers the body. 
Smell: I smelled the cap after I opened the bottle and wow, I knew I was in for an olfactory treat. There's a ton of grapefruit, lemon and pine on top of sweet caramel.
Taste: The flavor profile starts out as a fairly balanced blend of oily hops, floral, citrus, and resinous pine, and sweet, almost sugary, caramel malts. The taste starts to expand and take shape as a hop forward, yet all around big, elixir in the middle. Here's the coup de grace: Hop bitterness explodes in a delightful fury at the finish. This can hang with the best of the West (I can rhyme anytime). 
Mouthfeel: It's medium-bodied and slightly sticky with super lively carbonation. 
Drinkability: I can feel the ABV, but I can't taste it. I'm not really getting the vicious assault that other BA's have reported. I'd love to have several more bottles to drink myself into a blackout followed by a comatose hibernation. Can somebody spot me the $90? If the price wasn't so ridiculous and the availability wasn't so limited, I would keep Dreadnaught around a lot of the time. F--- you Three Floyds for standing in the way of our love! 1,426 charactersgoschool, Jan 12, 2007
4.72/5  rDev +7.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Served from a 22oz bomber into a tall weizen glass.
Appearance: Pours a very deep orange and copper hue. A slightly off white head rose to about 2 fingers and then subsided rather quickly. The beer is a little cloudy so the beading is a bit tough to see but it is there.
Smell: Very expressive peach and citrus aromas abound. The hop aromas are not very spicy but rather floral. A nice sweet malty smell fights its way up through hoppy and alcoholic aromas.
Taste: This is absolutley stunning. I took a generous mouthfull on the first taste, stinging alcohol/hop/citrus burned the insides of my cheeks. Very bitter while not being overly aggressive. Waves of grapefruit, oranges and peaches. After a few more sipps the sting subsided and the flavors all come together. As this beer gets warmer, the ample malt bill is coming through in the form of some caramel and maybe a little toffee. Just delicious.
Mouthfeel: Not as full as some other DIPAS but still ample. I would say this body leans towards the fatter side of medium. Rather dry in the finish.
Drinkability: This beer is like a Grizzley in a balarena outfit. Hugley powerful and expressive yet light nimble and balanced. A true masterwork and possibly the pinnacle of the style. One of the best DIPAS in the world.

4.3/5  rDev -2.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5This is one good IPA. Poured a clear golden yellow in the off light and a reddish orange in the direct light. 1/4" head that disappears quickly. Smells grassy with apple sense. Tastes like a bitter apple with the sweetness of a grape. Hops hit you like a pillow fight and make you sit back and relax. This is how hops should act. Shock your mouth then level off into a flavorfull film on the tongue. Mouthfeel is a tinge creamy but more like skim milk, but so flavorfull it makes up for the thin body. Alcohol level is extremely well hidden and as of now I could drink many more of these. Luckily I only have one as I have to work tomorrow and if I had more than one I probably wouldn't get up! Overall, this is one good IPA, enjoyable and too overpowering. 757 charactersstouty1, Jan 03, 2007
4.71/5  rDev +7.3%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Appearance:
The beer pours a bright high copper color in to a tulip. There wasn't any head to this bottle so as such there was no lacing or retention to mention.
Smell:
The scent is potent and truly pleasing. There's strong sweet apricot notes with a tart granny smith apple kick underneath. 
Taste and Mouthfeel:
This is what 9.5% ABV should taste like, anything but alcohol. There's a lot of apricot and caramel malt sweetness which completely mask what is a rather high ABV. Even better they managed to pack in a lot of hops with only a mild amount of bitterness at the beginning of the drink. The beer drinks a little on the viscous side almost like a milk mouthfeel. This beer tastes like the freshest homebrew I've ever had.
Drinkability:
Aside from awesome flavor the only thing taking away from this beer's sheer poundability is the high ABV. A couple bombers of this and you will be on your ass.
Bottom Line:
It's just one of those beers that lives up to the hype IMO. I never thought I would like any FFF product more than Alpha King but this beer is some serious competition for that highly regarded spot. 1,133 charactersGrundle20, Jan 02, 2007

Mouth-Feel : Thick and syrupy - what I've come to expect from a Double IPA
Drink-ability : Over the top bitterness from start to finish made this a difficult beer for me to finish. I'm glad I had it with a meal. I would not have liked this one by itself.

4.74/5  rDev +8%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Served from a 22oz. bomber in a Duvel tulip at just below cellar temperature.
A - Against white backlight and during the pour, this beer has the luminescence you'd see from yellow highlighter ink on glass. Wicked. In the glass, it takes on a toasted orange hue with a fair amount of haze. Head is medium to small bubbled, off-white and rises to about 1/2 an inch. Lacing is sporadic and sappy -- but amazing legs! Head diminishes to a filmy island after a few minutes., and leaves a thick and persistent ring around the outside of the glass.
S - Even though the floral and cirtus zephyr that rises from the glass can be detected from over a foot away, the roasted caramel malt backbone still mamges to muscle it's way into the nose. The hops smell bright and fresh. The malts are hearty. Great balance. Great smell.
T - Nice presentation on the lightly toasted malts on the tip of the tongue. Sweet and round. In the middle, the grapefruit hoppiness begins it's descent, but rather than pushing the malts out of the way, the hops seem to meld with them, creating a balance that's sublime. The finish is sweet and citrusy with a bit of wild honey. The aftertaste is only a tinge yeasty, and citrus-peel bitter. Alcohol is detectable, but only in very minute amounts. 
M - Slick and thick on the way in, rising gently to a beautiful cascade of seafoam. The swallow is completely satisfying. Just the way I like it!
D - Again, Three Floyd's has proved themselves to be a monster in the craft brew industry, not only with their really cool names and labels, but more importantly with their consistently high-quality, inspired craft beers. 1,649 charactersEPseja, Dec 30, 2006
3.97/5  rDev -9.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3 |  overall: 3First off, this is a very good-looking beer. Though there is no head, there is subtle lacing throughout the glass, and its color is a beautiful reddish amber. A bit of weak carbonation floats up from beginning to end, as well.
The smell hits me right after it's poured, hard to avoid. A strong resinous, almost marijuanaish aroma, which settles into a sweet red grapefruit smell after a few seconds. I love how the smell changes over time.
Taste is also of grapefruit, but more bitter than sweet. There's a definite alcohol kick too, this one does not hide the abv well. I am not particularly fond of grapefruit, but I can at least respect that 3F hit the intended taste perfectly.
This one takes a definite hit on mouthfeel, it's a bit watered-down compared to other DIPA's. A bit more syrupy feel would match the taste. Not much carbonation to speak of, either.
Another hit for drinkability. Maybe it's because I dislike grapefruit, but the combination of thinly masked abv and average mouthfeel make me not want to drink all that much of the Dreadnaught. Dogfish Head 90-minute is much more drinkable and at least leaves me wanting another glass. Gotta give 3F props for the phenomenal smell, tho. 1,212 charactersfurbs, Dec 28, 2006

Nevertheless, they came home with me. Upon popping the cap, a blast of ruby-red grapefruit aroma hits your nose. Poured a hazy rosy red/orange hue with a frothy white head. Allowing it to sit for a several minutes, the aroma was some intense my cats followed the glass everywhere I placed it. Lovely smell of grapefruit tree(heavy hop), followed by a sweet hint of fruity alcohol. The flavor took me by surprise. Clean, crisp, medium to full body with a bitter sweet beginning that ends with a fizzy, moderate alcoholic feel and long heavy sweet acidic aftertaste. In all this brew rocks. It really reminds me of drinking fresh squeeze rudy red grapefruit, it even leave a nice tart and sticky feel on your lips. Folks, if you can find this brew. BUY IT! It worth the money. Enjoy. 881 charactersGimpyCane, Dec 24, 2006

Great appearance with it's dark orange coloring, white lace that stays for a bit.
Fresh hops dominate the nose, accompanied with Citrus/orange rind, and a fresh outdoor woodsey odor.
The taste is near perfection, if you love double IPA's as I do. Smooth, creamy, nice light carbination mouth feel. 
Hops are beautifully pungent, but balenced. Citrus ending is refreshing with a nice bitterness at the end. The alcohol is warming, but not overwhelming.
If you don't try this beer....well... I won't really do anything....just try this beer anyway you will thank me.

I thought maybe it was off for some reason so I asked for three bottles in a trade to try it fresh and then aged a year or so.
After all five bottles I remain unimpressed. It is a good DIPA with all the pine and citrus with a caramel/malty backbone and long dry bitter aftertaste. In a blind tasting this would be in the middle of the pack. Is it the best DIPA in the world? There is no way. 528 characterslou91, Dec 18, 2006

Flat, cask-conditioned vibe, with low carbonation, a soft head, and chewy body with slight sweetness and stickyness; heavy stuff. The thickness of the malts are apparent by looking into this hazy amber ale. It's not quite too thick, though- just perfect for the style and strong enough for the alcohol and the hops to lean on. Great hop character; it's right up front and fades away to pure bitterness. Much like white grapefruit, including the rind. Reminiscant of sharp cheddar. High alpha resins all over this beast.
Via trade with zrrbrrt. Cheers! 695 charactersrayjay, Dec 16, 2006

This beer pours a deep orange amber color with a sticky foam head. Lacing remains all the way down the glass.
The first smell that hits you with this beer is a strong grapefruit aroma, followed by some pine and cut grass. No shortage of hops here!! A fairly strong alcohol presence is also noted in the smell.
The part of the taste that stands out for me is how much malt backbone there is with this beer. Huge amounts of hops are obvious, but they are balanced equisitely by a strong, malty flavor that compliments the hops. The beer reminds me of ruby red grapegruit juice that has added sugar.
The mouthfeel is rich and thick, with a smooth carbonation and a crisp finish.
This beer is extremely well balanced. I'm not a hophead by any means, but this beer could convert me. An excellent offering by Three Floyds. 883 charactersdoppelmeup, Dec 10, 2006
4.48/5  rDev +2.1%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.522 oz. from Lone Hill in Glendora.
Appearance: Pours with no head. Lacing is also fairly non-existent and spotty. However, the body: A beautiful dark honey amber. Transluscent as all hell: copper, gold, carrot orange, etc. One of the most beautiful colorings of any beer I've ever seen, hence the rating.
Smell: It took me a while to pinpoint an aroma I was getting out of this, and I kid you not, it is that of oil. Not any particular oil, but oil. A testament to how many hops are in this thing. Indeed, it is hoppy. Citrus: grapefruit, tangerine, lemon zest. Mango. Kiwi sweetness. Deep washes of beautiful pine. So many hop aromas, in fact, that it almost lends a spicy quality to the overall beer. Sort of reminded me of the taste of dried, chile-coated mango slices I get from Trader Joe's on occasion in that sense. My nose could pick out no particulars of the malt backbone, just that it was there, barely supporting the weight of the hop juggernauts it is forced to carry. Slight alcoholic sting in the nose, as well. Amazing.
Taste: Mango, a little pineapple, pine, grapefruit, on a massive, massive scale. A slight alcoholic rise through the nose and warmth upon swallowing. Not quite as impressive as the nose. The alcohol actually muddles the hop flavors a bit, but I've seen worse. Perhaps the beer's only true fault is that - it does not hide its ABV as well as some other DIPA's, and the subtlety of the flavors suffer. Still, it is such an exemplary hop specimen in terms of the boldness and complexity of hop character it contains that I can't help but rate it highly.
Mouthfeel: A lower point of the brew for me. Not bad - it was perfectly chewy and very, very oily, like DIPA should be, but it was definitely undercarbonated. Still, the oily character I detected in the nose is so prevalent in the mouthfeel that I was forgiving.
Drinkability: I'm not sure why others here have said this was almost too much for them/it's impossible to finish a 22 oz bottle. It certainly is not something you drink lightly, but having tried other big DIPAs (YuleSmith, Stone 10th, Hopsickle, etc.), Dreadnaught does not go leaps beyond those beers in terms of overall strength. Getting away from that, it is a truly exceptional DIPA, as its rating would have you believe. The best? I'm honestly not sure. Some day I will have a side-by-side taste test of various highly-rated DIPA's, and edit my review accordingly. : ) 2,438 charactersRidiculedDisplay, Dec 08, 2006
3.8/5  rDev -13.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3 |  overall: 2Sometimes when you go to a fancy restaurant, they give you bread with spicy olive oil that has been infused with chili or whatever. Thats prettymuch the color of this beer. It turns more orange and almost ruby when light strikes it a certain way. The racing carbonation forms a thick head like whipped egg whites that leaves a layered wall of lacing and it perfumes the air above the glass with what may be one of the most pungent and simultaneously inviting aromas of any beer ever. I would describe it as sweet, deeply resinous, and a thick, sticky, drippy blend of honey, mango, peach, and grapefruit, with prickly pine notes in the background. I also get some grape aroma, curiously I can not make up my mind if we are talking red or white though. Deep quaffing of the beer actually pricks and tickles the back of my throat with an odd sensation. 
Despite all the hop build-up in the nose, the taste begins sweet and floral, then goes resinous with any pine still lurking in the background before the bitter creeps on and introduces a swirl of grapefruit, solvent-like alcohol, a deeper pine tone, and a dark, hot, spiciness which is backing a possible caraway seed character. The beer warms a bit more and I start to hear from sugary malt but this is countered by the development of salty hop aftertaste. The aftertaste definately sticks with you (literally) and morphs as you drink this anywhere from resinous and sticky to wispy perfume and booze. 
At some point, either the beer warms up, the alcohol begins to affect me, my palate just gets numbed to the bitter, or some cobination thereof takes place and I have a different beer on my hands. Instead of the tumultuous touge-rodeo of the first tastes, I now have a more fluid blend of resinous hop bitter, sweet malt, hot spice and booze, and a perfume of hop florals. In other words, this eventually started to taste like a just above average 2IPA. 
The mouthfeel on this beer is quite literally sticky. I have never had such a sticky beer in my life. My lips stick together, my fingers are sticky where a little dribbled down the glass, just smelling it made my throat feel sticky, and it coats the mouth in an amazing way, unless you bust out some cheese or something, you'll be tasting this for hours after your last sip. This might be hop head's dream but i personally found it a bit off-putting. The mouthfeel got more pleasant toward the end but I think thats only because I started eating food to help me get this guy down, which brings me to drinkability.
If this beer has one key downfall, it is definately drinkability. Anyone who wants to drink an entire bomber of this either A) Is a smoker B) Feels like he has something to prove C) Loves hops at the expense of anything close to balance. Don't get me wrong, this is an interesting and relativley well-made beer, but I would much rather pay for a single or 6 pack of ponies than 10 bucks for a bomber most will struggle to finish. 
My final thoughts... I can wrap this brew up in one word, "RESINOUS". The reviews I read of this one had lead me to expect a fairly piney brew. While it does have its coniferous qualities, it is much less that fresh, evergreen, Christmas-tree, vibe than a big 'ol gob of sap and pine tar. I rate this beer the way I did because I respect its complexity, and it pretty-much delivers what it promises, but its not really my style. I know what I'm about to say is BA heresy but sometimes folks, big beer is just gross beer. You can go too far, and I think Dreadnaught really walks the line. While I respect that, I don't think I'll buy it again. 3,612 charactersJudgeRoughneck, Dec 04, 2006
4/5  rDev -8.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured a bright yet cloudy medium copper hue with a half finger foamy white head. There was decent retention and good lacing.
The smell was upfront heavy caramel malt with a secondary oily hop.
The taste consisted of a strong caramel malt with a solid, yet secondary spicy resiny hop. Very good toasted grain and orange sweetness at the finish.
The mouthfeel was full with a mild warming alcohol.
Overall a nice malty DIPA. Not as hoppy as I was expecting. Complex flavor profile nonetheless. Thanks to orbitalr0x for sending this my way. 550 charactersplaid75, Dec 02, 2006
4.37/5  rDev -0.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 422oz bomber sans date. Pours a honey color flared with bursts of gold. The two finger white head recedes rather quickly, never firming up much, but leaving ample strands of sticky lace.
The bouquet is a delightful blend of fragrant, floral hops, accompanied by citrus and pine. The flavor is hops, hops, and more hops, yet it offers varied hop characterstics--sweet, bitter, at times a bit phenolic--they never grow overbearing, and theres a little sugar and citrus to temper the hops.
The mouth is complex, pretty light for the most part, until the bitter hops dry things out on the finsh, although a little sugar sticks to the lips at the end. The rounded, balance nature of this beer makes it highly drinkable, and I think what seperates it from many DIPA. It's hoppy as hell, yet it is far from a pure hop burn. It's wicked awsome. 841 charactersOsiris9588, Nov 30, 2006

The smell car typical DIPA. Big malt with piney hops beating it down.
The taste followed, The beer is plenty hopy and the big malty backbone is needed and makes it. This one could actually use more malt but I would not say the contrary about many beers.
The mouthfeel was good a big full body and good carbonation.

4.32/5  rDev -1.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Served in pint glass from a 22 oz. bomber bought at the Dilly Deli
A-Orangish hue with a solid white head that dissipates quickly. Leaves a little lace, but not as much as sme other DIPA's.
S-Some serious citrus along with that piney, resiny, hop oil smell that I love.
T-Lots of grapefruit bitterness, but is smoothed out with a good dose of malt that doesn't let the hops become overly powerful. Fear not hopheads, there is plenty here. You get some of the warmth from the 9.5% ABV on the finish.
M-Light carbonation combined with a smoothness from that malt that lets it glide right on down.
D-Very well balanced. Plenty of hops to satisfy any hophead, but not completely overpowering. 
O-Very, very good beer. Great balance, but let's face it, when you grap a DIPA you want lots of hops, and this does not disappoint. Not may favorite DIPA, but one that will always have a solid spot in my collection. 923 characterswharfrat1, Nov 28, 2006
3.23/5  rDev -26.4%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 2.5 |  overall: 2.522oz bomber picked up from a local bar, What a great find! 
At least initially...
Poured into a tulip glass
Smell is in line with the style, piney hops, piney hops, and some piney hops. Oh yeah, and alcohol.
Taste was the big let down. First taste, straight out of the fridge was horrible, nothing but alcohol with a faint hop twist. Obviously, letting it warm is the way to go. After letting is sit for 15 minutes, it improved greatly. The taste was of solid, and quality, hop oils, grapefuit---with that signature Three Floyds citrus twist. Also was a little hot, the alcohol was more than noticeable, and there was just not enough malt to go around. The malt did a great job, but it just didn't stand a chance here.
Overall, worth seeking out, if only to find out what all the fuss is about. I've been hunting for this brew for a long time, the fact that I found it by accident in a local bar should have been an omen. I know the guys at this bar take care of their beer, so I know I didn't get a bad bottle. I just didn't enjoy it. I will be buying another to cellar for at least a year, I hope that helps me realize what all the hub-bub is about. 1,162 charactersleftmindedrighty, Nov 26, 2006
4.62/5  rDev +5.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5This beer offers a showcase example of what incredible flavor (and not just bitterness) hops can add to a beer. This showcase starts with the aroma. Huge floral hop essences are easily perceptible when it's still a good six inches away from the the nose. The show continues with an explosion of flavor on the palate. A near perfect melding of bitterness, flavor, and malt. The hops flavors and essences run the gamut from fruity-citrusy, to woody-resinous, to oily-sweet; and are huge and juicy.
An exceptional beer, worthy of its high rating and worth seeking out for any afficianado of hoppy beer. 602 charactersmarksto, Nov 25, 2006

Nose offers orange, grapefruit peel, some malt, lemon blossom, and floral hops. The taste is incredibly bready before going to white grapefruit. The flavors are extremely obvious, but not overbearing or cloying. Incredibly big and balanced, this double IPA hits on all notes. There's a little alcohol, a tiny bit of malt balancing things out, and even some more orange citrus peaking through. Finishes dry, with a little hop oil coating the tongue on the way down. 564 charactersdherling, Nov 19, 2006
4.52/5  rDev +3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Dreadnaught arrived in a bowtie glass, crystal clear and somewhere between apple juice and amber in color. The head was a creamy thick blanket of beige foam and the lace was sinfully thick and sticky.
 As the bartender set the glass on the bar I began to pick up the scent of hops. Hops and more hops, piney hops, citrus grapefruit hops, green leafy hops in all their glory.
Bringing the glass to my nose brought the scents of sweet fruits; apricot and mango with a hint of caramel.
 The initial flavor was dominated by hops (go figure) and the bite of alcohol. Piney and citrus hops followed by sweet fruit flavors, a hint of caramel and 100 IBUs of bitterness. You would think the hops would be enough to overpower any other flavors, but that was not the case. The balance does lean toward the hop side, but the sweetness is not completely overwhelmed. 
 I live less than three miles from Three Floyds brewery and I guess my palate has finally gotten to the point where I can appreciate a beer of this magnitude. This is certainly one of my two favorite DIPAs. I wont mention the other one.
 I would call this medium in body with a moderate carbonation and smooth mouthfeel. I could attempt to session with Dreadnaught, but the 9.5% ABV would probably end my night early. 1,280 charactersEvilKeith, Nov 17, 2006

no date
Pours a slightly hazed ambered orange with an off white thick dense head that hangs around. and leaves some sticky gobs of lace. Carbonation is steady and light.
Nose: Sweet pineapple juice tweaks the nose. A citrus explosion with hints of orange, mango and peaches. 
Taste: Piney burst with a slick sweet malt presense that creates a balance that the nose doesn't indicate. Bitterness is high and mighty and lasts and lasts and lasts. 
Mouthfeel is thick oily and ends dry.
A mighty big beer that is easily drinkable as alcohol is undetectable. I only had one bomber, so when i was finished i drank an alpha king, and boy is the dreadnaught alpha king's big brother. Glad i got a chance to try it, a hope to see it again. 778 charactersbeerphan, Nov 13, 2006

A really wondeful bouquet, and I use the word bouquet specifically because there are so many delicious floral aromas coming off this beer.
Wow, I would have never believed such a strong, hopped-up beer could have such a smooth, well-rounded flavor. This beer tastes so fresh and alive, with really wonderful citrus, floral, and grassy hop flavors just pouring out if it, and yet there is very little bitterness. In fact, it's a little sweet.
A very nice, full mouthfeel with plenty of body.
I would pick this again in second, and I hope to do just that very soon. 648 charactersstrattor, Nov 13, 2006

22 oz. bomber served in a pint glass at several degrees over fridge temperature. 
Appearance- Pours a hazy orange with a solid, three finger crown that settles patiently to a thick mat of tightly packed bubbles. Lacing begins instantaneously, lining the walls of the inside of my glass. Looks good.
Smell- Massive 3F signature hop nose, sticky and piney with a huge malt presence. Great balance, killer strength.
Taste- Amazing achievement... never before have I experienced such a smooth, easy, impeccably crafted DIPA that hides its potency so well within the flavors. There's no rough edge to the beer whatsoever, just a very hoppy brew that has the bold malts to counter the bitterness... the tasting is so easy that I can only say it's surprisingly effortless.
Mouthfeel/Drinkability- The weight of this beer in the mouth, along with its overall texture and viscosity, is amazing. It spills like silk upon entry, gently and perfectly foaming up like liquid suds in seconds, then it backs off and glides down the throat. The phenomenal balance of malt and hops cannot be praised enough... it's a really big beer that kicks in halfway through the tasting and reminds me of its capabilities, but it's fantastically drinkable. The hops don't finish harshly, they simply melt away and reappear in terrific belches throughout the rest of the evening. 
Dreadnaught is, in my opinion, the model by which beers of this style should be measured against. So glad and privileged to have tried it. 1,688 charactersyelterdow, Nov 13, 2006

Pours out an orangy-copper color with a thin white head that stick around for the entire drink... not to mention the sides of the glass.
Aroma is all hop. Citrusy, piney, bubble-gum smelling hops. Smell=taste. Sticky hop residue all over my mouth. Bitterness followed up by a sledgehammer of hop flavor. Sturdy malt backbone to support this hop blitzkrieg.
Sticky across the palate. Lingering hop flavors (go figure) with a touch of sweetness.
9.5%? You're kidding. Extremely drinkable for it's strength. I do believe this beer deserves the high marks it gets. 670 charactersbobbyc881, Nov 03, 2006

eyes...
holy crap! I can smell the amarillo poppin from 3 feet away.. but let me get to the look. lots of carbonation, 2 full fingers of craggy foam with immediate lacing present as the head slowly receded. retention at beer level is really good with smaller bubbles keeping the head quite alive. 
"it was only mostly dead"
a nice mix of orange and ruby tone, looking at this is like finding the penthouse youtr dad stashed in the closet when you were 14. but thankfully the pages of this beer won't stick together.
nose...
take an orange, smash it up in your fingers, now do the same with some hops, people may think you are nuts but that is the only way to relive this odor. although this is an assault on your hop senses you can detect the malt. Not much else to add, this is a nice one.
taste etc...
thick and slick yet smooth, like billy d williams, this works everytime. unusually smooth actually, the carbonation isn't prickly but it makes the mouthfeel full and satisfying, This doensn't kill you with hops, there is a really nice balance here of flavors. Don't get me wrong, this has great bitterness but the malt really ties this one together, superb! Absolutely no sense of the alcohol in the flavor. 9.5%? jeez. This one isn't over-amarilloed like some 3F beers, damn this is tasty.
verdict?
oh hell yes. An extremely well balanced DIPA, with tax this was around $7 a bottle!! I will be going to clean the store out of the rest of their stock post haste.
more thoughts:
this is BIG BEER. the definition of big beer is THIS beer. Forget the other DIPAs, there are great ones. No other DIPA is as balanced and as well crafted as this beer, and they have been doing it for years. Other brewers will catch up, but Dreadnaught is worth the hype. I like some other DIPAs slightly more only due to hop "bombness" but in balance this is the standard, period. 2,197 charactersEgo, Oct 31, 2006

Wow, the smell is the absolute best part of this brew - strong on the citrus. When first tasting Dreadnaught, I picked up more piney hop taste than the smell indicates. The more I drank, however, the citrus hop flavor came through. The mouthfeel was spot on for my tastes: medium-bodied and well-carbonated. Drinkability is high on this beer. Sure, the alcohol level is elevated on this beer, but it fits the category and the beer is easy to drink. I paid $8.99 for this bomber and it was worth it (although pricey for an everyday beer). 646 charactersThorsHammer, Oct 25, 2006
3.82/5  rDev -13%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Gold-tinged orange beer. Cloudy, with very little bubbling. Topped with three fingers of cream-colored head -- probably the product of a particularly violent pour -- lacing in rings. You could be strolling down the sidewalk outside my house and still catch a whiff of grapefruit from the Dreadnaught, but you will have to lean over the glass to catch the caramel malt and dizzying booze.
A valiant effort by the malt, but Dreadnaught's taste has none of the nminute balance nixed in the fumes coming off this thing. The best you get is peppery bitterness in with the citrus hop blitz. Nice light-to-medium feel. Any thicker would be tough to handle. Light carbonation, but maybe I burned it out on the pour.
Not so high on this, but that's me. I would give an unqualified recommendation to hop addicts. 808 charactersmaundythirsty, Oct 24, 2006

A: Poured into a pint glass. Dark orange in color with a chilled haze throughout the glass. Pours a creamy white head that is two fingers thick and dissipates into a spider web like lacing that clings to the glass throughout the sampling.
S: Absolutely huge on the hops! A grapefriut or citric tone along with pine resin. Definite alcohol presence.
T: The intial taste is an Amirillo hop blast to your mouth. Sweet caramel malts try to come through but are beaten back by more hops. This beer is swimming in layers of tropical fruit. Grapefruit, oranges or mango. Finishes with a nice pine hop bitter bite.
M: Extemely smooth and creamy for a DIPA. Oily and slick mouthfeel with a warming alcohol sensation.

4.48/5  rDev +2.1%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.522oz. brown bottle, no date information.
Pours oily slick, a deeply hazed bright orange-flecked amber. Modest but long-lived head of medium sized parchment bubbles. The head dissolves to floes of fine bubbles and a popped collar. Globs of thick, sticky lace cling to the glass. Spartan carbonation streams laze trails of fine bubbles upwards. Thickly sweet pine and fresh crushed orange rind aromas waft from the glass, there is also a bright, clean blossom note, and a bit of sweet tarts thrown in. Promising and inviting. An initial hit of alcohol laced hop juice blasts home. Huge doses of orange rind and pine sap sit atop a thick malt base that provides ample backing while still allowing the hops to remain center stage. After the initial hit, the alcohol is well masked through the middle until the finish where it spikes the tongue with its warmth. The hops are absolutely wonderful in this; fresh oily, and resinous and the huge quantity of hop oil lasts long into the finish. This has a huge body and yet there is enough carbonation to make it feel almost medium. The hops leave a slick trail on the tongue which gets a bit numb. Absolutely a hop monster and backed with an ample body. Everything about this beer is big: aroma, taste, mouthfeel and, unfortunately, also the price tag. At $11/bottle, this is a steep indulgence. Dreadnaught brings its A-game, but other quality DIPAs are available at much lower prices. This was quite tasty, but I couldnt stop thinking about how pricey it is. 1,511 charactershopsaplenty, Oct 16, 2006
4.67/5  rDev +6.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured from a 22oz bottle into my Stone IPA glass.
Appearance - Pours a beautiful dark honey/orange color that is very clear. The head is off-white and, for the most part, soapy with big bubbles. The head is about a finger and a half thick and retains pretty well, eventually dissipating to a thin cap of creamy head. Leaves good but patchy lacing on the way down. No carbonation activity from within.
Smell - Wow, what a smell! Tropical fruits on the nose bit time. Lots of grapefruit and mango action. Caramel sweetness and bitterness from the hops, which are mellower in aroma than expected. Some moderate spiciness and a mild doughy/buscuity malt aroma. Little alcohol scent. Probably the most pleasant nose on any beer I've ever had.
Taste - The hops come out a lot more in the flavor. Slightly oily and very wet bitterness, with some more mild floral notes mixed in. Of course the tropical fruits are present as well, with grapefruit and mango dominating them again but also hints of cherry, lemon, orange, and pear. Peppery spiciness in the middle, with herbal notes: rosemary and basil. Rich raw dough-like/bready malt character that does a superb job of balancing the exotic character of the hops. The aftertaste has strong earthiness from the yeast, and a linger hops bitterness. The most complex IPA I've ever tasted, and possibly the most complex flavor, period.
Mouthfeel - Lively carbonation, that lends to the beers overall refreshing quality. The body is medium-bodied and surprisingly smooth for the style.
Drinkability - Excellent drinkability due to its refreshing quality and medium-body.
Wow! By far, the BEST IPA I've ever had...ever. I opened this bottle expecting just a super bitter DIPA with maybe a few extra flavors here and there. I admit I guessed it was over-hyped, but no way. This beer is fantastically complex and...damn this stuff is heavenly. You definitely want to drink this stuff a bit on the warmer side, to get all the different flavors (~50F). A MUST HAVE BEER! 2,021 charactersdblinkhorn, Oct 04, 2006

Tastes of a strong IPA, lots of hops, good citrus makeup without the tanginess. Starts out creamy then turns to bite you, then calms down for a nice finish. A good choice if you can find it. 384 charactersMebuzzard, Sep 30, 2006
4.62/5  rDev +5.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Many thanks to Everett for the opportunity to try this beer.
Pours a light orange amber with a massive, craggy off-white head that slowly melts to very sticky lacing which stays thick on the glass
The nose is immediately hit with the aroma of fresh hops...even before you finish the pour. Sweet citrus hops. Orange peel hops. Pine oils.
Taste is sweet amber malt, orange citrus hop, then lemon finishing to a very assertive grapefruit. I am reminded of the first time I tried Arrogant Bastard and thought, "Whoa! This is really strong" Now years later, AB is more the norm to my palette and here I am again thinking, "Whoa! This is really strong."
How refreshing to be shocked into the world of a new beer.
Wonderfully full of flavors I seem to have lost in the last several DIPAs I've had.
Aftertaste is citrus peel hops, pine, and alcohol warmth.

4.67/5  rDev +6.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Cloudy deep orange with a billowing tan head that diminishes but never dissipates. Wonderful smell of pungent piney citrus hops and a hint of biscuit malt somewhere beneath the murkiness. The taste follows suit perfectly. Spicy orange citrus hops dominate the forefront of the palate, with a presence of pine and resin, but are rapidly brought into check with some bready caramel malt sweetness. Ridiculous layers of fruity complexity can be found within the hop bitterness on this one. Sticky and full on the mouthfeel, with a dry oily finish that lingers on tremendously. The taste has a surprisingly better balance than one might expect from an Imperial IPA, without the typical one-sided nature. Extremely satisfying. 721 charactersjmatthew, Sep 18, 2006

A fresh sucker punch of hops hits the nose. Wonderful, bountiful hops hit the senses. Loaded with citrus oils and the smell of fresh grass. The hops freshness produced by this brew is amazing. 
The mouth is hit with an unbelievable rush of hops. Again, the freshness of the hoppy flavors is remarkable. Some sweet malty notes with a honey presence. Spicy ginger and coriander add a bit of complexity. There is some alcohol presence but nothing too substantial. Long and powerful hoppy finish. 
Mouthfeel is highly carbonated, slightly viscous and relatively clean considering the amount of hops that must be used in this brew. 
Drinkability could be limited by the fact that there is absolutely no balance to this beer. Then again, it's a DIPA and balance is certainly not intended. The constant desire to taste the hop freshness results in frequent sips but this is not exactly an easy-drinking brew. 
I was skeptical before trying but this brew certainly lived up to the hype. 1,209 charactersBudlum, Sep 16, 2006
4.94/5  rDev +12.5%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I've been quite tardy in updating my review of this American classic. $10.99 for a 22oz bomber at Keg Liquors in Clarksville, Indiana. A two hour drive from my home in western Kentucky, but an easy sidetrip off Interstate 64, when passing through Louisville, for points north, south, or east. I'm disappointed that I can't find this in Evansville. 
The appearance is nice enough, but unspectacular. A basically clear, amber body is topped by a small, but persistent, raw almond head. Patchy lacing is inviting, but not awe inspiring.
Aroma steps the experience up a few notches. Incredible bouquet features large hops that create a heavenly touch of fresh lime, orange, pink grapefruit, tangerine, and kiwi. A honey drenched, orange marmelade note is appreciated, as well. 
Mouthfeel is full and tantalizing with flavors. Accented by a perfect carbonation. Hops presence is fleeting on the tongue, leaving tang that begs for more.
Taste is bittersweet and juicy citrus hops. Lots of fresh lime pulp and live orange zest flood the palate with a lively and organic hops presence. A mild caramel green apple sweetness is welcomed midway through and adds to the ridiculous complexity of the citrusy hop cornucopia. Finishes dry and citrusy, with a pleasant hop aftertaste.
Dreadnaught is an Ameican classic. Truly exceptional, and worthy of all hype. Only Russian River's aged Pliny ales can claim a perch so lofty as this Indiana treasure. American brewing at its best! 1,481 charactersmerlin48, Sep 15, 2006
4.62/5  rDev +5.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a beautiful warm amber, almost rose', but not really. If amber could be mixed with rose. The head is not to crazy, but mildly present. The smell is amazing, one of the best smelling beers. Sents of pine, pine apple, mango, citrus, with a strong bitter hop character. The mouth full is fresh, clean, and a little sticky at the end. The bitterness is balanced masterfully with the fruit. It finishes dry and makes you want more. The taste lingers on your palate for quite some time. The after taste of pear, chocolate, pine and more fruit. This beer is complex, compelling and great, but if one is not prepared for such complex intensity they might be thrown off, but not me. I love you dreadnaught. 703 charactersmmcave, Sep 06, 2006
4.8/5  rDev +9.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5This was different from every other DIPA I have had. There was tons of different floral notes in it. Things like a bit grassy and piney. The malts came through but did take a back seat. The flavors ranged from citrus hops to floral hops and to malts. The alcohol was well hidden. I picked up tastes of lemon, grapefruit, a bit of orange also. The smell resembled the taste very well also. I really wish I could get this here but at same time I'm glad I can't at $10 a bottle I would be broke. This is probably my favorite DIPA and most different one I've tried. I would defiantly pick up another bottle of this if I ever find it again. 635 charactersBlindPig, Sep 05, 2006
4.35/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Wow. Where to begin. This bomber poured a gorgeous chill-hazed bronze, with a massive foamy ecru head that bubbled down to a blanket that covered it until the very last drop. Sticky lace remained. Before the pour, before the head, as soon as tha cap was popped, the aroma hit- fresh-cut pink grapefruit, citrus, pine. Amazing nose.
Taste follows suit- grapefruit, but sweet, with hop oils and malt dancing around together. Puckering like grapefruit, but sweet like orange marmalade. Nicely done. Mouthfeel is creamy, with light carbonation. "Chewiest" Imperial IPA I've tried thus far. 
Is it drinkable? Absolutely. A session beer? I think not. Would I have more if it were available here?. You bet. A wonderful Imperial IPA.
Many thanks to BeerBeing for the opportunity to try this. 792 charactersbabydoc, Sep 05, 2006
3.7/5  rDev -15.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5First, I should state I am not a huge fan of this style. I love hops but it seems DIPA brewers are in a contest to see who can overload the most hops into their brew. That said, this is the best of the style I have tried and much better than the Dogfish Head 90 minute which is in my opinion more a novelty beer than anything worth drinking (the 120 is simply putrid).
 This is a light golden with just hint of reddish hue; it produces a decent head a that is appropriately dry and stiff. It smells pretty good; obviously, hops dominate mostly floral, but there is a touch of malt and a little bready yeast too. The taste is hops upfront and hops to finish but you can actually taste some savory maltiness, a little sweetness and a pleasant yeastiness. Even though this is apparently equal in ABV to the Dogfish 90 this is much much smoother and does not have the unpleasant raw alcohol character of that brew. It's got nice body and a true complexity rather than just being a hops and alcohol extravaganza. It's not something I'd want as a steady diet but an occasional one or two is enjoyable. 1,098 charactersDeconstructionis, Aug 31, 2006
4.89/5  rDev +11.4%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Bomber from Bowling Green. Managed to keep this king of IPA's in my fridge for all of two days before trying it. Too much anticipation.. anyways, here we go. Pours a clear dark golden with an orange hue. A medium/large persistant white head laces the glass. Smell is glorious sweet, spicy and citrusy hops. Piney and herbal hop notes are present as well. Taste is spicy then citrusy and sweet - like grapefruit and honey. Earthy and piney hop flavors come in. A delicious sweet malt backbone manages to complement the hops perfectly. Finishes with a hint of warming alcohol and a pleasant lingering herbal hop bitterness. Fantastic. So much going on here and it's all great. Mouthfeel is absolutely perfect- creamy and slightly heavy. Extremely drinkable. I must say that this did not disappoint- quite a feat given my high expectations. Just an awesome beer. The best IPA and actually, for me, the best beer I've had so far. 925 charactersburnstar, Aug 31, 2006
4.14/5  rDev -5.7%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5A great warmup for the lupulin flogging I'm going to get in my upcoming trip to the west coast...
Appearance: Lovely pale maple blonde, and perfectly translucent. Pretty nice head on it as well.
Smell: Wa-Zooey! Sticky sweet hops, it's like shrinking down to nanometer size and having a coamping trip on a hop bud floating on a shotglass full of honey. It had a few alcoholic vapors that gave some fusels but without stealing the thunder of the star of the show.
Taste: Just barely enough malt to give a half second of opposition to the massive onslaught of hops. A quick glance at the dictionnary gives the definition of Dreadnaught as a kind of battleship with really big guns. Well, my tongue and all taste receptors therein waved the white flag of surrender, as it shriveled up and dried out. Very long and leafy, green aftertaste. Unbalanced? Maybe, but every once and a while, it's good to throw a spanner in the works! 934 charactersGoldorak, Aug 31, 2006

Consider me "wowed" from the moment I popped the cap off. Body is autumn orange with scant head. Nice rings of lacing are left behind. Nose is orange pineapple mingled with vanilla and pine that clubs you over the head. Yippee this kicks serious ass! The sugary orange leaps out first and is paced by tangerines, pine and grapefruit. The malt backing is sufficiently caramely to provide some relief. All I can say tastewise is that this truly is a double IPA not to mess with unless you are a true devotee. Mouth is huge, with sparse carbonation providing a creamy mouthfeel. 
Thank the almighty lord I have another bottle of this in the fridge. I won't be drinking it tonight ... but when I need that hop fix it will be a life saver. This double IPA rocks! 798 charactersTheBungyo, Aug 26, 2006

pours a nice golden colour with a thick off-white head.
aroma is a blast of hops. lots of grapefruit and a bit of pine.
taste is great. heavy grapefruit taste with some pine. a little warmth once you've had a few sips. not a whole lot of malt presence noticeable, but that's probably due to the hop domination.
mouthfeel is good. carbonation level feels about right.
drinkability is good. it hides the alcohol really well and it's damn tasty. really enjoying this one. 532 charactersgrub, Aug 19, 2006
4.72/5  rDev +7.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Picked this baby up recently at Stateline in MD for $8.99. What an absolutely delicious, mouth-watering DIPA! Pours a bright amber-orange color. Produces a thin, 1/4" head which fades to a thin wispy coating. Beautiful, rich, sweet fruity aromas of oranges, pineapple, grapefruit, peach, pine needles and caramel fill the nose. The hop aroma profile in this beer is simply incredible. Mouthfeel is moderately full, but silky smooth and a perfect subdued carbonation level. The flavor would in my estimation be pretty tough to surpass. Perfect balance here between the hops and malt. Starts sweet with notes of caramel candy, toasted malts, and apricot. The hops then kick in with avengence showing off flavors of pink grapefruit, orange, pine resin, flowers and herbs. Finishes with a stout, assertive hop bitterness which is followed by a mild alcoholic warmth. Just a beautiful, classy brew. 893 charactersmacster, Aug 15, 2006
4.47/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours bright amber. Nice white head, smooth carbonation but not too much to impart an acidic flavor. Aroma gives off the freshest hop odor you'll get this side of Dogfish Head. Slightly grassy, like many IPAs, but in addition strong pungent, sweet, oily hop aromas abound. The flavor carries a fantastic blend of floral hop tastes, with sour apple, grapefruit, and sweet citrus at the forefront. Yes, many beers carry these hop flavors, but the Dreadnaught manages to make them taste FRESH. Almost no alcohol phenols present, and though there is a great sweetness to this beer, it is not presented as a malty heaviness. Overall, this is a fantastic double ipa that emphasizes the beauty of hops without simply delivering grassy bitterness over strong malts. 757 charactersBeauregard, Aug 13, 2006

4.82/5  rDev +9.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Thank you kmudrick for bringing this up from Beeryard in PA. Soon after arrival, it became a contestant in a blind dipa tasting. The other double ipas tasted: Dogfish Head 90 min, Stoudts Double IPA and Lagunitas Shutdown (the double ipas I happen to have on hand). Though it did not win in all five categories (DFH won appearance, Dreadnaught won smell and taste, Stoudts won mouthfeel & drinkablity) it did come out on top overall, with Stoudts a close second. 
Anyway, what more can be said about a beer that has been reviewed 381 times? Though hopheads will certainly have a mouthgasm with each sip, it is not an over-the-top extreme beer that forgets about the art of balance. Bitterness is smoothed, as is the alcohol. It would probably be more drinkable if it wasnt so expensive. If youre lucky enough to come across this, however, spend the money. You wont regret it. 894 charactersbwyker, Aug 08, 2006

4.37/5  rDev -0.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Beautiful amber color, crystal clear and almost sparkles in the glass. Head wasnt that big to start with. Solid white half inch that reduced to scattered layer of bubbles on the top.
Intense aroma with a little bit of everything mixed in. Lots of citrus, grapefruit and tangerine, is immediately noticeable with a nice pine backbone and some floral notes as well. Some slight hints of alcohol are evident but not overpowering and works with the sweetness. This is not a subtle brew.
Lots of bitterness in this one, no doubt about the DIPA moniker. A citrus and pine sap hop mixture form most of this beer. Resinous towards the finish. The pine starts it out with some tangerine again. The bitter finish has more grapefruit. Alcohol twang is evident. Not much malts there, but some caramel sweetness is evident. I like this one, but not my favorite hop flavor profile. Ive had other DIPAs that I find similar, so nothing too unique for me. Good nonetheless.
Near perfect mouthfeel for me. Just heavy enough to coat the mouth and the flavor really lingers. The Weyerbacher Double Simcoe was way too heavy for me, but this one is full bodied w/o being over the top. A bit more carbonation would make this perfect.
Good drinkability. Lots of good traits in this beer, but like I mentioned, not my favorite hop profile. This every now and then in a 12oz would be perfect. 1,382 charactersblitz134, Aug 02, 2006
4.35/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5I'm not a DIPA person but I like this beer. I have been trying to find out what it is about the DIPA that attracts so many. I have to say first off that I prefer doppelbock, hefeweizen, quads & stouts. I knew there was a reason people called themselves hopheads and I was going to find out why. I've tried a number of DIPA's like Ruination etc., but have been put off by the lengthy bitterness at the end of each drink. I can understand that some drinkers will like that bitterness but it would have to be a studied, acquired taste for me. 
A - a nice creamy head that soon dissapated. The orangish, amber, hazy color was quite nice.
S - The hops flew up to your nose before you ever lean over to take a whiff and it too, was intense and invigorating. This is what hops is supposed to smell like, I think. The grapefruit smell is quite nice.
T - Again, the hops is intense like the smell and there is the grapefruit. I also get a taste of the alcohol but not in anyway overwhelmingly. For me there is the slight bitterness that I'm not fond of yet but it didn't turn me off at all. It all felt very balanced and slightly complex as you moved from one taste to another.
M - This was the best part for me with this beer. I can see how the taste of the hops can be addictive as it coats your tongue, palate and the back of your throat and hangs on for a long time as it becomes a more oily, sweet, malt taste as well. When I finished the bottle I kept sucking at the back of my tongue for this lingering flavor.
D - I could drink a couple of these quite happily but would be pretty wobbly considering I am a lightweight when it comes to alcohol consumption. 
If anyone can recommend another DIPA that is so nicely balanced between the hops & malt while not being overly bitter I would like to give that one a try. 
For $9 it seemed pricey for a 22 oz. bottle at first but really not bad considering what you receive in the quality of it's impressive character. 1,976 charactersmeatyard, Jul 26, 2006

The smell is of citrus and stone fruits, while the taste is fruity up front followed by a long, long, long hop beautiful hop tastes followed a lasting astringent (but pleasant) bitterness. The malts are well integrated, but dominated by the hops. The mouthfeel is a tad sticky, but still relatively dry. For me, this is a great beer that is eminently drinkable. 418 charactersGeorgiabeer, Jul 23, 2006
3.5/5  rDev -20.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3 |  overall: 3Appearance: Pretty, peachy, clear orange-autumn-amber. Bone-colored head is decent in size with fair retention.
Smell: Bold, bright, hop blitzkrieg up front, running the gamut from floral to piney to peppery and herbal, but mostly citric, with lemon and oroblanco notes. Malts add a light caramel sweetness with a drop of honey.
Taste: Well, it's good, but it certainly isn't the hop apocalypse I was expecting considering this is rated the top DIPA and the fourth-best beer in the world. It's just as heavy on the malts as it is on the hops, with a strong sugary side that almost reminds me of cough syrup. Alcohol is poorly hidden, adding a boozy rum character. Hops are pleasantly herbal, woody, and sweetly resinous (not as citric as the nose let on), and the malts turn nutty and toasty towards the end. Finish is boozy and bitter with a citrus pith tone.
Mouthfeel: Extremely syrupy and heavy on the palate. Carbonation does little to lighten things up or add any kind of airy chewability. Alcohol becomes slightly numbing towards the end of the bomber.
Drinkability: What's all the fuss? In my opinion, this is extreme in all the wrong places. The malts and alcohol land with a thud on the tongue, nearly crushing the hops, which are barely bright enough to stand up to the sweetness. That's not to say it isn't a moderately tasty and interesting beer, but for $9 a bomber I don't think I'll ever drink it again, unless you're buying. 1,453 characterssoulgrowl, Jul 20, 2006
4.31/5  rDev -1.8%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Very cloudy, almost murky, but vibrant burnt orange with a very small, slightly off-white, creamy head that quickly diminishes to light wisps of bubbles. The nose is huge. Heavenly hops aromas of pine, citrus and resin and backed up by a malt backbone that miraculously isnt completely shut out by the monster hops. The buttery toffee aroma it brings adds balance and makes the nose mouth-watering. Fabulous. The taste follows suit with more of the same balance between the two heavyweights. Theres the spicy, bitter hops that rush in full-force initially, but quickly back off a little to let the malts show through with a sweet flavor vaguely similar to an oatmeal cookie made with some brown sugar and a touch of molasses. A good amount of fruit in there, along with a little white wine and a hint of licorice. The finish is bitter and long, with hops oils refusing to let go of your cheeks and tongue. It has a medium-full body oily texture and low carbonation. What can I say, I think I set the bar a little to high on this one. However it almost met up to my expectations, I think mostly because of its fantastic aroma and great balance. Im not sure if Id consider this one of the best DIPAs in the world, but it certainly was an enjoyable experience that brought a smile to my face. Thanks, hero27, for the opportunity to try this big beer. 1,357 charactersski271, Jul 20, 2006
4.82/5  rDev +9.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I wasn't originally planning on reviewing this beer, but after tasting it I was more then obliged to give it the review it deserves. It pours a sublime amber color, with a medium sized white head that quickly turned to a small white lacing. Smell was full of complexities...lots of grassy earth, some herbs such as cinnamon, some grapefruit tastes, and plenty of hops to go around. Taste really made my day. The citrus flavors along with the intoxicating hop flavors completely complimented each other in a way that few other ipa's i have tried have achieved. The mouthfeel was absolutely perfect, balanced in every sense of the word...hoppy yet smooth to the point of being almost too good. If this beer wasn't suvch a rarity for me, I probably would have drowned my glass in one fell swoop, but under the circumstances, I savored every single sip. This beer is the reason why beer should be respected and revered as an artform. I would go so far as to say that this is the best Imperial IPA/IPA in general that I have ever tasted. I never thought that another brewery could exceed dogfishhead 90 minute ipa, but this one completelly blows it out of the water. If you ever see this beer or have the oppurtunity to get it, dont even ponder it for a second, just get it, i promise it will not fail to satisfy. One of the most lovely beers i've ever tried. EXTRA special thanks to warriorsoul for a beer enlightening experience like none other. Cheers 1,449 charactersjamie2dope, Jul 13, 2006
4.39/5  rDev 0%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4I cracked this bad boy open when the World Cup Finals went into overtime. I figured if this is to be a special occasion beer, now would be an appropriate time to partake. Also perhaps unconsciously in honor of the World Cup, I poured it into a gold-rimmed goblet.
I don't have the most acute sense of smell, but I could appreciate the scent of this beer before my nose was within a foot of the glass. I immediately smelled a crisp sweetness, somewhere between apple and pear. The brew didn't smell hoppy at all (unless this sweetness is characteristic of a particular hop), just very refreshing. The scent reminded me of Avery's Maharaja IPA, only the fruitiness was more intense.
It poured with a slight head that settled to a small puddle of lace floating atop a transparent, bubbly amber liquid.
Upon my first sip, I immediately realized this was unlike any other IPA I've tried (and I should hope not considering the bomber cost me $15.99). First pear/apple/peach, then hops. I love a good, bitter IPA (Stone IPA has been my all-time favorite for its pure hoppiness), but the sweetness of this one was quite pleasing and balanced well with the hops, although it was just a tad too sweet for a perfect 5.
Mouthfeel was fantastic going in, with the alcohol well disguised and the carbonation in perfect moderation. My one complaint was, as is true of many IPA's, the hops left a stale residue feeling on the roof of my mouth. I know this is common for IPA's, but I have had some with a clean aftertaste that doesn't linger (e.g. Stone IPA), and I prefer this cleanness to feeling compelled to take another sip to try and wash off the remnants of the last sip (obviously a self-defeating effort).
I'd consider American IPA's to be my favorite style of beer, and since joining BA, I've had my fair share of them. I still have to give Stone IPA the nod for #1 in American IPA's overall, due to its uncanny ability to be purely bitter and hoppy yet surprisingly crisp and refreshing, but this now stands as my favorite of the few DIPA's I've tried, and is definitely in a league of its own in terms of smell and flavor. However, at $15.99 a bottle, I may have to savor this moment longer than I'd like unless and until I have the opportunity to visit Indiana and try it at the source. 2,297 charactersinstrumentality, Jul 09, 2006

This beer poured a beautiful, bright apricot color with a beige, 1/2 inch head of foam. Plenty of belgian lace on the glass. The aroma is fantastic! A hop feast. It's like I'm smelling a just-opened bag of Cascade hop pellets. This must be dry-hopped with a ton of hops.
The taste is a complex hop party. There's so much going on. I taste tangerine, orange, peach, and even pine! You would think that this would cause a very bitter aftertaste, but it's really barely there.
The mouth-feel is full, kind of thick, with a clean, dry finish. More full than other Double IPAs.
This is a fantastic beer. Very drinkable and enjoyable - not in large amounts with its overwhelming flavor - but a glass or two definitely makes the day better. 797 characterswestweasel, Jul 05, 2006
4.53/5  rDev +3.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Maximum respect to nflmvp for sending this my way in a trade. Poured into a Duvel tulip, Dreadnaught is a glowing orange mass with a dense, clotted ecru foam head. Orange and tangerine blossom citrus scents mix with a thick and sweet crystal malt aroma. Perhaps this isn't the freshest bottle, but I expected a bit more "oomph" in the aroma. Orange spiced sugar cookie dough, with a pleasant finishing pine and grapefruit pith bitterness. Some peach flavors emerge, as well. As it warms, more and varied fruit flavors become noticeable. This is much more balanced than I expected. Many reviews emphasize either an extreme blast of hops or a gargantuan sweetness, but I find that this strikes a nice equilibrium. There's a slightly sour, almost vegetal aftertaste. Quite interesting flavor profile, to be sure; many different hop-induced flavors are apparent, but not a single one stands out as a "crutch" flavor. There's lemon verbena, grapefruit, bitter orange, nectarine -- a very surprising and welcome panoply! It's not as juicy as I like my IPAs to be, but it's not too thick and syrupy either. 9.5% alcohol is expertly masked. All told, this is indeed an excellent DIPA, but not quite at the top of my list. Overall, it's beautifully crafted and surprisingly balanced. Glad to have had the opportunity to sample it. 1,321 charactersorfeu, Jul 03, 2006

Orange amber color with medium to heavy carbonation evenly visible through beer. Good looker.

4.97/5  rDev +13.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Here it is, the fabled Dreadnaught...
Body is orange with a pretty thick white head. Head did not get as large, or linger as long as expected. Less lacing than I expected, too. Still a very beautiful DIPA.
Nose is huge. Citrus really dominates, with a slightly resiny-spicy component. This is the scent that I have been looking for, it actually makes your taste buds cringe a little...and that's a good thing.
Flavor is tremendous! This is what a double IPA is all about. Massive, sugared citrus flavors come in waves. Lemon, orange, grapefruit, this has it all. Plenty of resinous piney flavors as well. There is a solid malt backbone there, it is quite a substantial brew. But generally, this is a bit unbalanced in the hop direction, but I am very glad.
Mouthfeel is medium with noticeable hop oils and that wonderful tooth-stripping quality that we love so well.
Drinkability is tops, no question. I need to make a pilgrimage to FFF and try to get more of this incredible brew.
My favorite brewery, my favorite style, what more can I say? 1,060 charactersghostwalker, Jun 29, 2006
4.62/5  rDev +5.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Pours cloudy orange with a thick creamy head that leaves generous lacing.
Smell is everything a DIPA should be. Tons of herbal and piney citus hop. A very pleasant grassy aroma. The juicy citrus is making my mouth water. Just amazing. Underlying hints of a sweet malt base.
Taste is similiar to the nose but the toasted malt base really jumps out. Still, the hops are dominating with a wonderful mix of hop styles. Finish is spicy citrus and bitter. Floral hops seem to really make an impression in the lingering finish.
Mouthfeel is Medium-full, with only slight hop oilyness.
This is a very impressive beer. Wonderfully balanced. Juicy citrus will keep me coming back for more. 691 charactersBlakaeris, Jun 26, 2006
4.59/5  rDev +4.6%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured a hazy reddish orange color with a thick creamy head that left great lacing. and had good retention.
Smell is Hops, lots and lots of hops, big citrusy, grassy and floral hops odors. It smells absolutely fantastic.
Taste is shockingly balanced. After that big hop filled nose the flavor has a great strong semi sweet and toasty malt backbone with a nice grapefruit and lemony bit of hops in the finish.
Mouthfeel is thick and oily leaving a long lasting tongue coating.
Overall an excellent DIPA from 3 Floyds. 528 charactersbashiba, Jun 26, 2006
4.37/5  rDev -0.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5A big thank you to NFLMVP for this beer. 
I love a hoppy beer, and this fit the bill. The smell was very nice, hops with a mild sweetness that I am not familiar with in the DIPA's I have had. 
The taste was big hops hit up front, followed by the sweet caramel flavor that was in the smell. I was not expecting this, and at first I wasn't sure if I liked this. After a few drinks, realized it helped round out the beer, and was overall a good thing. I still prefer a little stronger hops finish. 
Overall a great beer, different than what I am used to in a DIPA, but a great interpretation of the style. 614 charactersBoolshot, Jun 19, 2006
4.44/5  rDev +1.1%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5The beer poured an nice amber with a minimal head that quickly faded. You could tell that this beer was so saturated with hop oils that it suppressed any chances of a big head.
The aroma was wonderfully pungent. The nose was dominated by an explosive burst of resiny and citrusy hops. Also in the nose were notes of apricots and honey.
The flavor of the beer was primarily that of citrusy hops (duh) with enough of a light caramel maltiness to help round things out. As potent (and lovely) as the hops were, they were very smooth. The beer was well attenuated so it wasn't smackingly sweet like, which is were I feel that most double IPAs are susceptible to loosing points. The beer had a very "bright" taste and a nice spiciness that I prefer in IPAs and DIPAs. Many brewers out there bottle condition their DIPAs, but in my opinion, the yeast cake zaps much of the intended potency of the beer after a few months. When it comes to DIPAs, I'm in favor of enough time for flavors to meld, but not mellow, hence, I didn't let this bottle sit around before cracking it open.
The mouthfeel was medium and the carbonation seemed dialed in just right. As I mentioned the beer was well attenuated and considering it was 9.5%, it was in no way too heavy and very drinkable. If you're lucky enough to find it on the shelves, buy as many as you can. I California, we don't get 3F, but I'm fortunate enough to have an "Indianna Connection" that brings me amazing beer several times a year. 1,488 charactersSacoDeToro, Jun 19, 2006

Thick, chewey mouthfeel. Syrupy, slightly oily.

Incredibly drinkable! An outstanding beer! 302 charactersBillyB, Jun 17, 2006
4.8/5  rDev +9.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5large 22oz bottle, served around 50f. Pours with small white head, odor is immediately recognizable as similar hop profile to Bitter & Twisted (harveistoun) or DFH 60 min, though dreadnaught is a good bit more citrusy in the taste. Fabulous nose, floral and citrus.
Taste is the same hops as smell, but they are perfect on the palate, quickly dissolving into a mildly bitter finish, with the 9.5% barely hinted at. Further swallows seem to have a more bitter profile up front as the taste buds adjust.
Absolutely fabulous craft product, this is the third beer from 3 floyds i have had and the rave reviews on it are completely justified. Try this beer! 658 charactersdogfooddog, Jun 16, 2006

S: Orgasm inducing. Bits of pine and loads of citrus. Could smell this all night.
T: Big hop flavor up front. Barely balanced with enough malt, but who cares this is a hop bomb. Of course, finishes clean.
M: Thick and tasty. Syrupy and sweet.
D: Definitely a DIPA, but a DIPA I want to drink. Could drink a bomber or two every night. The best expressive of my favorite style. 522 characterskdmorse, Jun 16, 2006
4.35/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Ruby color with a rich, creamy, white head that slowly dissipates. Tiny bubbles shoot up the glass to the little island of head in the middle, leaves a nice lacing. Lemon, citrus, a lot of grapefruit aroma, actually smells thick with grapefruit. Taste is loads up with the lemon and citrus, but the grapefruit is most definately dominant, almost like a concentrated grapefruit juice. Be prepared, full of juicy hops. Thick, sticky on the tongue, full bodied and high carbonation explode flavors onto your tongue. This is great on occasion, but would probably wear out your palate if had too often. Get some if you can. 618 charactersbadbeer, Jun 15, 2006
4.65/5  rDev +5.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Wow... (a beer that actually lives up to the hype - what a pleasure)
The beer pours a deep bright orangish-yellow with a thick, sticky white head. Plenty of lacing on the glass as you wade through this murky masterpiece.
The aroma is decidedly sweet with notes of sugar, alcohol, honey and flowers complimenting the obvious and plentiful sweet herbal and floral hops.
The flavor is amazingly well balanced. There are certainly huge hop notes on all aspects of the mouth but it's very, very smooth and well balanced by the alcohol sweetness and a rich creamy sweetness. Bitterness is well controlled letting the oils and flavors of the hops shine through without overwhelming. Some grapefruit notes and some floral notes add to an interesting complexity. An underlying sweetness and light golden grain flavor smooth things out even more.
The mouthfeel is surprisingly both solid and light at the same time. The beer is on the heavy side of medium bodied with a 'thickness' similar to a good orange juice with pulp - it's quite solid. At the same time the fine effervescence gives this all the weight of meringue on the tongue. Mild bitterness lends for a clean finish with just a bit of oil and residual sugar on the tongue. The mouthfeel is as complex as the aroma and flavor: a real rarity.
I don't know that there's anything useful I can say about this brew that hasn't been said before. It's certainly a masterpiece and well deserving of all the accolades. If you're a hophead you -must- try this beer. 1,520 charactersRedwoodGeorge, Jun 14, 2006
4.82/5  rDev +9.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5My IPA, DIPA, and Barleywine beinge as of late has been absolutely amazing. And this beer does not stray from the trend. A beautiful pour unlocks a frothy white head, crystal clear strawberry blonde appearance, great to look at. The aroma is complex and full....probably one of the best smelling beers I have had the pleasure of drinking., grapfruit dominates and oily pine hops are very present, there are some more subdued notes of dark fruits (strawberries/cherries) and some sweet carmel and some grainy undertones as well....very good. The taste is great as well...there is so much hapening it is difficult to pick out single flavors, initially the beer is sweet, the dark fruitiness is back with hints of cherries maybe even a bit peachy, in the middle there are some fancy grains and you begin to understand that this one is going to kick, the alchohol comes through a bit here too. Not in a repulsive amount....it adds so much to the beer. In the finish you get your hop blast that balances the beer and then throws it over the edge...hopped to the point of perfection. While waiting for sips (which is sooo dificult) you get a warmth all the way down from the alcohol and also some of the grains stick with the taste. The mouthfeel is creamy smooth and carbonated nicely.
I must have this beer again...You could session it....and enjoy it...and definately have a headache the next day...because I would drink this one till the lot is finished. 1,455 charactershoffman, Jun 14, 2006
4.32/5  rDev -1.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4appearance: Pours a low white head that soon becomes only a slight ring around the glass. The beer is a light-medium amber in color, crystal clear.
smell: Great tropical fruit aromas of floral, green, evergreen hops. Some notes of citrus. Very fresh hop aroma. Just enough malty sweetness to back it up, while maintaning the fresh hop dominance I like in this style.
mouthfeel: The carbonation is on the very high end of the low range, and the body is a lighter heavy. 
taste: Similar to the aroma in terms of all out hop goodness. Big flavors of sweet, fruity, fresh PacNW hops. It seems to manage to not taste like hop tea, which is nice. A moderate caramel malty sweetness runs alongside. The bitterness is not all too big, but considerable. Finishes with a lingering bitterness and some sticky malt sweetness on the lips and tongue.
drinkability: Pretty easy for such a beer

4.7/5  rDev +7.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Massive creamy white head that is exploding with aroma as I pour it. Hazy copper body with no visible carbonation bubbles. The head turns into a hop meringue as it sits for a couple of minutes.
Intense citrus with a solid malt presence. Peaches, oranges, tangerines and the ever favorite grapefruit are all present. Seriously smells like Tropicana fruit juice with a little pine-sol.
Holy monkey. Lets float on down this river of flavor, shall we? First, the cold liquid hits your mouth and quenches your thirst as the initial cold-shock fades to a piney hop bitterness. Just around the bend comes the citrus and other light fruits and it finishes with a sweet over-ripe white-grape aftertaste. All the while a backbone of sweet malt keeps everything in near-perfect balance. Truely exceptional.
Oily and dense just like I love my IIPA's. Coats your mouth and slowly trickles down your throat. Carbonation is just right and the smoothness of this beer makes you lust for another sip. 
Definitely lives up to the hype. I loved it. 1,041 characterstrep, Jun 11, 2006

Pours light gold to orange in color. Beautiful bouqet of citrusy hops here, I could sit and smell this for quite a while. Aromas are big bitter grapefruit, sweet peaches, and sweet oranges. The citrus and peach flavors come through very well in the taste, this medium bodied beer has a nice dry bitter bite to its finish that makes you drink more. Outstanding beer. 521 charactershoppymeal, Jun 04, 2006
4.92/5  rDev +12.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5WOW! Now this is a Double IPA. It has everything I love about the style (times two), wrapped up in this beer. It pours a beautiful dark orange with a big creamy head. The aroma just knocks you off your feet from the start. It is amazingly well balance with *huge* citric grapefruit and pine aroma appropriately matched with just enough big sweet fruity malts and sugars. The taste is phenomenal. It is creamy and bold with giant hops from beginning to end, matched by a fruity malt undertone. The grapefruit aftertaste seemed to linger infinitely, that is, until the next sip when we start all over again. As most DIPAs it would be unrealistic to consider a 9.5% ABV sessionable but this beer went down so quick and easy I wished I was sharing :).
[EDIT I have finally finished a case by myself and I must say this sweet gem is well worth ti $110 price tag. mmm =) on of my favorites. It is a sweet grapefruit pineapple sweet one.]
Hope this is helpful.

4.17/5  rDev -5%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Recieved in a trade from badbeer, Dreadnaught pours a dark gold color, with a one finger head. Quickly falls into a ring around the glass. A little lacing, but not a whole lot. Beautiful color though.
Aroma is decidedly hoppy. Slightly sweet smelling, along with fruity hops and a touch of caramel. Nice prelude here.
Flavor is simply amazing. Hugely hoppy, mostly floral and piney hops, but there are also some fruity smelling hops, that give off flavors of peaches. Malt brings up the rear and ties this beer together. Finish is dry, and lingers bitterly for quite a long time. I'm having a very hard time not giving this beer a 5 for flavor, but I think that 1 or 2 IBU less and it would have it. While it is very well balanced, its not quite perfect. That being said, this is easily the best imperial IPA I've ever had.
Mouhfeel is slightly oilly and coating, and drinkability is good. Alcohol is not present in the flavor or aroma. 945 charactersphisig137, Jun 04, 2006
4.97/5  rDev +13.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Absolutely awsome!
This double IPA has everything a hop lover dreams of. With a dark golden color and beautifully tight head even looking at it makes you want to cheer! The scent of the hops is dynamite. The smell makes you feel like you are going to taste a fresh hop plant. The first sip exhibits an excellent hopiness on the front of your tounge and as the ale procedes to the back it is as smooth as a soft serve ice cream going down your palate. This is by far my favorite double IPA. I recommend this to anyone. 520 charactersHellsBELLS24, Jun 04, 2006

S: If you put hops thru a juicer then poured it into a glass, thats how this beer smells. Various degrees of tangerine, cedar with a touch of tin. Hints of alcohol as a high note.
T: Starts sweet, honeylike. Citrus notes immediately flare..first lemon then mandarin. Finishes pine cone resiny with a healthy bitter smackdown at the back of the tongue. And the bitterness doesn't let up. It beckons the mouth for more, taunting the tongue for another sip.
M: The thickest IPA I've ever had. Frankly, the thickest non imperial stout I've ever had. Almost chewy, like it has less actual liquid in it than most beers.
D: There is no question in my mind that this is the best IPA on the market. How could this beer had been better? Not very easilly. A longer lasting thick head would have made this beer perfect.
I would do obscene things to try this beer on tap. 1,043 charactersWestsidethreat, Jun 02, 2006
4.97/5  rDev +13.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured from a bomber into St. Bernardus Chalice
Bottle is undated.
So, it's my last night in Bloomington, the town I have called home & grown to love over the past four years. I sit in my mostly empty room, ready to munch on the world's greatest vegetarian burrito (Laughing Planet!). The time seems right to crack open the myth, the legend: the Dreadnaught...
A - Pours a translucent, dark pumpkin orange with a solid 1 inch head that fades at its own decent pace leaving a thin layer of heady-goodness. Lacing is very solid and most appetizing.
S - Wow, that is perfection. Sure, its hoppy like any other Double IPA, but a rich bouquet of fruit and floral notes almost overwhelms my sniffer. Its not orange, its not grapefruit, its not banana or coriander or chive or anything else; its all of these things and more. The smell is probably the most lasting memory of this brew. I remember my buddy had two bombers of Dread at a party, and I could smell the deliciousness from across the room.
T & M - Lives up to the aromatics and maybe even surpasses them. Sweet when it touches your lips, rich & doughy on the tongue, and a perfect amount of hop bitterness in the aftertaste. As with the smell, this seems like so much more than a standard Double IPA Hopbomb because the sweetness fights admirably with the hop bitterness throughout. I take it all back, the taste is the most memorable part about Dreadnaught. 
D - Well it tastes great and the alcohol is not evident in the taste (but it might be evident in your actions...). If someday I have ridiculous amounts of money I will be drinking this every night.
Can someone remind me why I am moving away from the state that produced this godsend? I anticipate setting up trade networks with midwest BAs to get my Dreadnaught fix... 1,801 charactersgmcfarre, Jun 01, 2006

The pours a clear dark copper with tight cabonation and small white head that disappears fairly quickly. The smell is wonderful...grapefruit and pine needles, slight hint of alcohol. The taste is just like the smell. Beautiful hop experience as the grapefruit and pine sap hit you upfront. The malt sweetens out the onslaught on the hops and finishes with a nice clean bite. The alcohol comes through with a little warming at the finish. Mouthfeel is medium and not as thick as I would have expected, but that makes the drinkability very good. This beer is not as heavy as I thought it would be at 9.5 abv, but a damn fine DIPA. One of the best! 709 charactersddarden, May 28, 2006

Flavor is a wallop of hops. Very chewy and juicy. All sorts of orangem tangerine and grapefruit citrus flavors. Does a great job of hiding the alcohol. Nice malt base that brings out a pleasant sweetness. Full but with a tad of a dry finish. Even though I cannot really taste the alcohol, the alcohol sure makes its presence known. 520 charactersMuddyFeet, May 28, 2006
4.59/5  rDev +4.6%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 22 oz bottle into a snifter.
Appearance: Copper with a slight orange glow - not very cloudy. The pour produced very little head, but an army of carbonation bubbles rose rapidly for the first minute or so after the pour, then slowed down. The orange glow is exciting and inviting - it makes me feel like I have something special in my hands.
Smell: Fruity scent with a slight kick - very invigorating
Taste: Hops abound, but it seems pretty mild in terms of bitterness for a double IPA. I definitely detect some tropical fruits, some citrus, maybe some apricot. After the initial flavors subside, I realized I can't really detect that is a high ABV beer, with the exception of the subtle warming taking place in the back of my throat. 
Mouthfeel: Smoother and lighter than I expected for this type of beer. My tongue tingles slightly, but it feels nice.
Drinkability: I've got a half-case waiting to be finished and I full intend to enjoy every sip :) Again, I'm amazed that the ABV is almost 10%. I'm traditionally not a hophead, but this beer is so delightful, I can see it persuading my taste buds. 1,129 characterskmudrick, May 26, 2006

Amazing strong aroma ranging from sweet tropical fruits to piney grapefruity hops. Initially sweet with peaches, apples, pineapples and apricot.

Overall, an easy to drink, delicious dipa. 397 charactersPx2GrafX, May 24, 2006

Nose is incredibly fragrant, full of flowery hops, pine, tree sap, grapefruit rinds, lemon juice, wow is this a hoplovers dream. Taste starts with a nice solid caramel malt, slight biscuit, which quickly gives way to a huge wave of hops, citric, almost puckering grapefruit, finishing with a nice lingering bitterness. As the beer warms, a more piney note begins to come through on the finish. Gentle warming of alcohol in the throat, though hardly detectable in the taste. Even though this is all about the hops, there is a big malt backbone that balances them out and prevents the palate from being overwhelmed. Full bodied with a thick creamy feel, this is a luscious sipper. This is absolutely one of the best DIPAs out there, and I could drink way more than my budget would allow. 915 characterscubedbee, May 23, 2006

A: Pours a perfect copper amberish color with a fizzy slight head hugging the sides of the glass. Not much head on this guy. What wonderful lace on the glass, spider web.
S: Huge piney and grapefruity smells up front. Wait, on the second sniff, I think I just ran into a pine tree. Oily resiny pine dominate the nostrils. What a great smelling beer.
T & M: Holy Motha!!! WOW!! Can you say smooth?! What a great tasting dipa. A nice pine and grapefruit balanced taste hit the palate first. Earthy malt tones underneath, and after the beer goes down the gullet. Then a smooth transfer into a bitter finish. Not overly bitter, but just perfect--it also warms the stomach and chest. Abv is not felt right away as it's hidden behind the pine and grapefruit tastes. Biting feeling on the lips and front of the tongue. Oily and sticky in the mouth. Hugs the sides of the mouth creating a layer of bitterness. Best dipa I've had to date.
D: Drinkability, ahhh yes! High drinkability. Great tasting, easy drinking, well balanced and medium bodied. Two huge sticky thumbs up! 1,148 charactersbjohnson, May 22, 2006

First thing I noticed immediately after popping the cap was the amazing aroma. Fruity, strong grapefruit smell, hoppy, citrus, floral and intense! The appearance is an interesting orange-amber color with a bit of red in it. Decent-sized, rocky head of a sort of yellowish-white color. Taste is clean, with sweet, grapefruit hops flavor leading to a touch of caramel and then a bitter hop finish. Very tasty. Mouthfeel is very smooth, with medium body and a nice amount of carbonation. This is a very drinkable DIPA, and I would have never guessed while drinking it that it was 9.5% ABV if I didn't know what is was. So smooth and delicious I could probably drink two! 690 charactersAaronHomoya, May 18, 2006

A clear golden red-ish orange with a beige 1" head, faded to a soapy ring. 
The smell was fabulous. Satsuma, oily hops, and mangos! The aroma never faded. 
The taste was sweet juicy grapefruit. White bread reigns in the bold hoppiness. Not as complex as I had imagined, but definitely worthwhile. The hops never peaked in to a puckery bitterness. Better to describe it as a nice "hop-tart". 
Body was full with mid/low carbonation.
I finished the 22 oz. myself which in other beers is often too much for me. Very drinkable. I'll buy it again even with the steep price. 683 charactersCresant, May 17, 2006

4.6/5  rDev +4.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5This beer pours a light orangish peach with some slight shades of brown. The head is a buttery light yellow egg shell film that left some very attractive strands of lace.
Smells like a walk through a pine forest after the rain. Theres also a little mandarin orange here as well. The fresh hops oozing out of this one really have my attention.
The flavor really caught me off guard. I was expecting a big hop punch in the mouth like Alpha King, but instead, I get a sublime doughy oats and honey malt that transitions into a crisp pine bough dryness that rides on top of the malt. There are also some sweet hints of oranges and peaches along the sides of my tongue. The bitterness of the hops in the finish is effortlessly blended into a toasted oat with a touch of fruity sweetness that lingers on a little too long. 
The mouth feel is silky smooth and a little heavy with a great micro carbonation that gives this beer an terrific body.
Im diggin this one. The smell is organic and fresh, the taste is subtle and supreme, and the mouth feel is right on. 9.5%? I wouldnt have believed it had I not seen in on the site. Im glad I caught that. Now I can try to pace out this bomber! 1,202 charactersDarkerTheBetter, May 13, 2006
4.42/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Light copper color with rose hues. No real head formed at all from the pour, although it appears there is nice bubbly carbonation present. The sweet citrus hop smell is evident long before I even get my nose near the glass. The aroma is truly an intense floral, grapefruit hop experience. The flavor is bright and malty up front with more citrus hop flavor carrying into a rather clean finish. Not that bitter really. The alcohol also is well disguised. Light to medium in body, the carbonation feels subtle, but overall the mouthfeel carries a silky smoothness which is nice. Drinkablilty is great for this brew, even if it is a strong one. It wasn't the amazing experience I had expected, just a slight stronger version of the already good Alpha King in my opinion... 769 charactersbennetj17, May 08, 2006
4.32/5  rDev -1.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Appearance is deep golden and clean and clear, the head has fallen and almost dissapeared, but leaves a good strong lacing.
The smell of cascade hops hits hard and leaves a slight fruity sweetness behind. Fruitiness reminds me of banana. The hops are a bit piney, but not off putting. The smell after a while turned to heavy grapefruit. 
Taste is piney cascade hops with a definite grapefruit in the nose. They blend together well. 
The mouthfeel is smooth and carbonated well.
I enjoy drinking this and will look forward to more once in a while. 558 charactersErdinger2003, May 06, 2006
4.49/5  rDev +2.3%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4An amber/orangish color, with a small head that forms and slowly laces down the glass. The aroma in one word, WOW! There is so much going on in the scent of this beer, citrus (mostly lemon and grapefruit), pine, floral, and earthy aromas. Man that is alot to take in. The taste has a good malt flavor right at the beginning, then the hops take over from there and dominate the flavor to very end. In the mouth it is very nice, it evenly coats the palate and the hops leave a nice dry finish. This beer is more drinkable to hop heads, not what I would call a good starter beer. This beer is truely a wonderful beer. 614 characterscameraman, May 04, 2006
4.18/5  rDev -4.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Poured a nice translucent, orange color with medium-high carbonation and a white, soapy head that left behind plenty of lacing. The beer appears bright and brisk in my pint glass with a soft mellow texture...very appealing. I detect aromas of grass, pine, and hops. The taste follows the smell with a dry, bitter core that is dominated by hops (as would be expected). Flavors of grapefruit and citrus also come out; crisp and juicy. Good texture, but a bit too slick for in my opinion. Easy to drink despite the high ABV. 521 charactersjaluria, May 04, 2006
4.72/5  rDev +7.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Have had this numerous times on tap, and had to give it a shot on cask. It was less carbonated, little head to be seen, but you could see an oily slickness on top of the beer. The smell was sweeter than regular dreadnaught, but extremely pungent with the piny and fruity, citrusy hops. The mouth was sweet, an almost sugary bread like flavor with a dry finish that is followed by heavy hops, mainly citrus and some pine. Very good on the cask, it's a shame I may never get to drink it like this again. 501 charactersHoboAGoGo, May 01, 2006
4.94/5  rDev +12.5%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Tried this firkin style at Dark Lord Day. Bright caramel golden hue. Very little head, with slight lacing.
Monster citrus aroma, enormous in the grapefruit, with spectacular hop aromas. Nice malty backbone, with lemon, orange, honey, and some mellon notes.
Absolutely fabulous. Had this draught last night at the 3 Floyds brew pub and the firkin is superior. Gian grapefruit flavors, velvety on the tongue. Nice floral hop tastes, good malt, citrus, delicious.
Drinkable all night and day just not enough to go around. If one of you local brew pubs get's this cask drive an hour or two to try it. Awesome! 614 charactersmcallister, Apr 29, 2006
4.58/5  rDev +4.3%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 522 ounce bottle. Dreadnaught pours out a clear orange color topped with a large head. Nice lacing. Bubbles appear to rise quite slowly. The aroma is a barrage of hops. There are notes of peaches, pine, and citrus. Very fresh smelling. The flavor is a big, oily hop flavor that lasts long after you finish sipping. Lots of fruitiness, especially peaches, oranges, and lemons. Although this beer is very bitter, a sticky sweetness comes through at the finish. Alcohol is deceiving. I wouldn't have guessed it to be as high as it is. This is a fine ipa, well worth the praise given it. 582 charactersbeveragecaptain, Apr 27, 2006

Masive citrusy, piney hop nose, lots of sweetness as well, caramel, biscuit, candi sugar. Initial flood of citrus, orange, grapefruit, mango, apricots is followed by lots of sticky sweetness, caramel, sugar, toffee. Incredibly juicy. Finish is medium length with a touch of bitterness and lingering sweetness. Mouthfeel is soft and smooth. Very nice beer, quite a unique taste.

No freshnees or batch date.
Pours a nice bright, glowing orange color. Slightly hazy. Half inch off white head, fades quickly, leaving some pretty good sticky lacing.There is a slick, oily feel to this beer. My favorite part of this beer is the smell. Very aromatic, lots of citrusy, piney hops, maybe some tropical fruits. Fantastic taste, nothing but hops up front, but there is a good sweet malty backbone to balance the taste. The piney, citrusy flavor is awesome and refreshing. Decent carbonation, and full bodied. Syrupy texture. I could drink this beer all day. My favorite double IPA by far. I really wish they would distribute Three Floyds to Michigan!! 714 charactersBigDaddyWil, Apr 18, 2006
4.55/5  rDev +3.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.522 oz. bomber. Pours with a big head. Great carbonation. Crystalline amber offset with chunky blobs. Better to let it settle.
Piney hops overlays some other fruity aromas. The Three Floyds website says that it's mango and peach. I don't notice those particularly, but whatever it is, it provides a nice interlude in the hop explosion.
Flavor starts with a smooth malty base, but not cloying and just enough to attempt a balancing of the hop waves. Some citrus flavor and a little bit of bubblegum also noticeable, but the dominant feature is pine. Usually I hate piney-hop flavor, but the brewers have managed to make their voodoo work this time for me. Likely other non-piney hops in there mitigate the effect.
Rounded, balanced and smooth mouthfeel. Partly due to solid carbonation, partly due to crisp hop bitterness, the finish scrubs the palate and preps you for another sip. Alcohol barely noticeable. 
Price was a little high, but that might have been the store. Factoring the alcohol content and the amount of ingredients that probably went into this, the price may not be that out of whack. Solidly drinkable and certainly something hopheads will love. 1,173 characterslongarm, Apr 16, 2006

Smelled very citrusy and tasted of sweet lemon and ornage zest. Mouthfeel was a little thick but acceptibly so, considering the ABV. Overall, the beer is very drinkable but a person better be careful with this one since the alcohol seems fairly well hidden.

5/5  rDev +13.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Pours a bright hazy amber with a thin but persistent head that disappears just a little too easily. In a Duvel tulip, it looks like a slightly darker Duvel. Aroma is massive and floral, bright sweet oranges and piney hops. I'd wash dishes with it.
Taste is a light, toasty malt with some serious hoppage. More bright hops, fruity sweet, biscuity, candy sweet, mandarin oranges or tangelos. Some earthiness, bits of a fruit garden, honeysuckle flowers, something soil-y and loamy about the flavors. No trace of alcohol, any tastes have been run out of town by the hops. Finish is bitter and lingers, mmmm, it lingers.
Mouthfeel is medium, very smooth, slick and oily. You don't so much drink it as slide it down your throat. Finished a bomber much too quickly. I've suffered through a lot of over-the-top hop bombs, but this is the best use of hops I've ever encountered. I originally went just a hair short of a perfect score, and debated it internally for days. But I have to relent and upgrade this to my third all-5s beer. It's just flawless. 1,051 charactersassurbanipaul, Apr 14, 2006

My expectations were very high and I was worried I'd be dissapointed. It poured a nice copper color with a orange tint and a nice white head. The aroma is awesome and powerful. Hops, Hops, Hops. I waited all day for this taste and it was more than I expected. Super hop flavor just exploding in your mouth with a surprisingly smooth finish. Not real bitter, just right. I being a hop head could drink this all night and everyday, but it is a special beer and needs to be reserved for special occasions. The best beer I ever had! 643 charactersbrewnut11, Apr 13, 2006

This poured out a lovely glowing amber, with a half finger head made of large bubbles that subsided rather quickly. Over a short period of time the head disappeared completely... that's the only thing I found detracting about the appearance.
Aroma was rich pine and citrus hops, lots of hop resins, pineapple, and some firm medium malts underneath. Complex.
Taste... wow, how do I describe it? A hop bomb in my mouth! MAJOR bitterness, huge pine and citrus flavors, some pineapple, a firm malt backbone, and some long lingering bitterness on the back of the tongue after the swallow. Tremendous.
Mouthfeel was slick and a little oily, quite chewy, a little astringent. Really good.
Drinkability is excellent. I could have another... not easily, but I'd be willing to try. 877 charactersconnecticutpoet, Apr 12, 2006

Aroma is fresh floral, grassy hops. Taste....yummm....delicious. Grassy, citrus hops shine through every sip. A little piney as well with just a tad of sweetness before the slight alcohol sting kicks in. Full bodied and a bit slick from the hop oils. Excellent brew.

This beer poured a peach colored amber/orange body with a small white head.
Nose was in your face. Waves of fruit, big citrus peel and intense resiny hops. Slightly floral and overall just very inviting.
Medium to full bodied. An oily hop resin swims in ever wave of this beer. Very fruity hops; oranges, peaches, apricots, lemons, limes, mangos. Dare I say, a fruit cocktail of fruit flavors. Very bitter from start to finish, never so overpowering as to be annoying, but this ain't short on hop bitterness. As for malt, it's a bit bready, almost in a wonder bread type softness. A slight touch of caramel sugary sweetness as well. Alcohol is present but really only adds a touch of warmth. Ends with a long lingering bitterness.
Right up there with Great Divides Hercules DIPA as one of the best hop monsters out there. Not sure which I like better, but... just an amazing beer. 1,031 characterstaez555, Apr 09, 2006
4.71/5  rDev +7.3%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a bottle into a tulip glass.
Looks a non-transparent orange with little head and some sticky lacing. Smell is great. I could smell the piney hops with the glass still sitting two feet away from me. After getting a little closer to my nose, I picked up some sweet fruity malts and those blended perfectly with the abundance of hops. Taste is excellent. I'm usually not a piney hop fan, but Three Floyds pulls this off with perfection. The malts are also kicked into overdrive, and like the smell, blend perfecty for a great taste. Mouthfeel is nice, but I feel it would have been helped with a little more carbonation. Other than that this is a full, chewy beer that I'd kill to be able to purchase locally in Northern California. We here on the West Coast like to claim that we are kings of the hopped brews, but Dreadnaught reminds us that there are breweries in the Mid West that can easily make the same claim. Wonderful job guys. It has been a pleasure to drink this ale. 990 charactersSethB2, Apr 09, 2006

4.85/5  rDev +10.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Its all been said about this one hasnt it? Ive been pondering what I could add for several days but Im drawing a blank accept to say that his beer lives up to the hype. I am no hop head, but Dreadnaught works on a level beyond its insane IBU. It is crafted so cleverly as to be one of the most balanced and drinkable beers I have put to my lips. For a beer with these ABV and IBU ratings to be so stable and equalized in every way is astonishing to me. 
I once saw a John Clease documentary called Face, which contended that humans define beauty in one another based first and foremost on symmetry. If that is the case then Dreadnaught is the Elizabeth Hurley of beers. It is perfectly symmetrical in every way. Each quality is proportional to the next.
In the aroma, notes of bristlecone pine, juniper, mountain flowers, sage, and nearly every citrus fruit imaginable all come together defining the Double IPA aroma. Taste is shocking, for the full force of each individual aroma assaults the tongue with the power of a platoon of trebuchets. The citrus, sweet at times, is controlled by bitter hops, and vice versa as they both steer the overall direction of the beer toward shear bliss.
As I was drinking the Dreadnaught the other night I began to humming a tune. Until my girlfriend said something, I didnt even recognize what I was humming. It was an old Fred Astaire song, Heaven, Im in Heaven Thats what the Dreadnaught did for me. 1,471 charactersDaPeculierDane, Apr 07, 2006

Nose of citrus- specifically grapefruit ad infinitum!! - A little bit of the malt playing the strong silent type in its backbone role was occasionally asserting itself -only to have grapefruit take center stage, as well as left and right !! Very inviting to us hopheads!! This is exactly how it tasted as well - grapefruit all over the place, on top of the caramel malt backbone , and more grapefruit again. Smooth mouth with moderate carbonation, went down very easy wtih thick hop oil coating left behind. I like this a lot, and find it easy to drink - excellent ale !! 757 charactersultralarry2006, Mar 30, 2006

No dates
This has been a favorite of mine ever since I found it in PA and MD. Now its time to review.
Appearance  2.5-finger thick, billowy white head that has reasonable life; rather clear amber/orange body with long-lasting and light, rising carbonation; lace is marginal
Smell  a full notch below DFH 90 Minute IPA in quality but still pretty damned good; pine, grapefruit, table sugar, take a whiff immediately after pour and the hop scent is so pure; wait until the body is nearly exposed to pick up more malts and even more hops
Taste  what an interwoven mesh of brash, searing hops and sugar-on-a-pink-grapefruit sweetness; its as if theres a heavy, sugar-coated pink grapefruit sitting on a chest and holding a multitude of unruly hops at bay; of course it loses; well-concealed ABV
Mouthfeel  elegantly oily with gentle carbonation; alcohol and hop dry the palate at close
Drinkability  for a beast of an IPA, its a joy
Every sip is an adventure. The ticket is steep but the ride is worth it. 1,046 charactersWonka, Mar 30, 2006

It looks like a ferrari, smells like apple pie and tastes like the your first kiss. Ok, not exactly, but it is a stunner on all counts.
Gives off a great 1-1.5 finger head, copper colored body and plenty of lacing all the way down.
Tastes like a dream. Like drinking hop oil from the hop. It is a big bold beer that would overwhlem the uninitiated, but is the type of beer that every hop head dreams about at night. There is a much more substantial malt backbone in this beer that adds a touch of sweetness you don't typcially find in a DIPA. 669 charactersNolanGTI, Mar 28, 2006
4/5  rDev -8.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured from large Three Floyds bottle into a wine glass. Deep copper color (very clear) thin head. 
The smell is of course hoppy, as is the taste. I suspect that Three Floyds uses the same hops or blend of hops in all of their beers, except maybe the Pride & Joy. I can taste the hops for hours afterwards.
Very nice but a little over-rated for my tastes. Pretty pricy too. I couldn't accurately give it a score above 4. 426 charactersTurdFurgison, Mar 24, 2006
4.77/5  rDev +8.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A hazy honey-orange as it bounds into my glass.. A drity off-white head is nice and foamy, and just under one finger..
Even before I go for the nose, I can smell this one. It;s a nice fruity hoppiness. Sort of a combo of fresh orange and hops. Reminds me of the smell of the hop freezer at the homebrew shop where I once spent my Saturdays in exchange for ingredients.
Flavour is all about the hops. This time, its a piney hop quality. There's a clear sweetness under it, but no real malt flavour that I can detect. The finish is clean and still plenty bitter. If you want a hop bomb, crawl out of your shelter. It's not so bitter it'll curl your toes, but the hop flavour is clear, present, and clean. 
Mouthfeel is just about perfect. Exactly the consistency I like, not overly carbonated, and it's not oily on top.
Drinkability? Let's just say there's enough floor space at Three Floyds, that I could probably move in pretty easily.
Be well

S - A big hop smell. Mix of some floral and some citrus with a nice biscuity taste. Some sweet sugary malt influence.
T - Some nice hop bitterness up front with sweet malts as well. Great taste with the hops leading but the malts making a big presence known.
M - Very nice. A well carbonated beer for a DIPA.

At first I was very excited to see this in Maryland, but after seeing the $12 price tag my enthusiasm waned. So I just pretended I was at a bar or better yet a concert or sporting event and ponyed up the cash for the bottle.
Almost immediately upon opening, a huge pine almost pine perfume aroma. Pours a clear, golden/amber with a ½ inch head tan, medium bubbles. Again, the aroma is huge pine hops. A perfect translation into the aroma of the beer, what I smell when sticking my face in a bag of fresh whole hops. Taste is the resinous pine from the aroma with a hint of candy sweetness fighting its way in. Great mouthfeel. The aroma just does not die. It lingers to the last sip. The aftertaste is long, smooth and bitter. 
I balked at the $12 price tag, but Im glad I decided to grab this one. Just about perfect IIPA. Because of the price, I could not drink this one everyday but great for a good kick in the teeth IIPA every once in a while. Just make sure it is around payday. 1,008 characterssacfly, Mar 20, 2006

Pretty nifty 22 oz bottle. Its not normal. . .or so it says.
Pours into my trusty stone pint glass. Not as dark as I expected, but still looks amazing. Orange-Amber, semi opaque, substantial amount of bubbles dancing towards the head from the bottom of the glass. Approx ¾ - 1 white head. Definite lacing action, but nothing major. I cant get over this smell. . .
Nose is utterly astounding. . .sweet, fruit-candy, floral, hops. . .I cant stop smelling it. . .
Not as complex as I expected. . . but simply amazing. Sweet, orange-strawberry. Not much that I can sense outside of that. A twang of banana? Very fruity and flowery, I can say that much with confidence. Super-smooth. . .I could drink this all night and still want more. Not the slap-in-the-face hop bomb that I expected. . .but its simply amazing.
9.5% ABV?! You cant be serious!! Alcohol is completely masked in the nose and the mouth. This is one amazing beer. I think I can now appreciate the term session beer.
I think I expected too much from this beer. It wasnt anything I expected it to be, but everything that it is was a pleasant surprise. . .its insanely tasty, and utterly drinkable. 1,243 charactersWaffleSauce, Mar 17, 2006

S: Smells like all kinds of vegetal stuff - grass clippings, pine needles, lettuce, and celery.
T: Tons of hop flavor and bitterness in this all the way through the taste. Very intense vegetal flavors (pine and celery), as well as a touch of orange and citrus. If I were to decide to lick a pine tree one day, I think it would probably taste a little like this.
M: Full-bodied and extremely thick and heavy. Subtle carbonation lets the flavor come out
D: This is the least favorite of the DIPA's that I have tried. The vegetal flavors are too overwhelming, and although I don't consider the taste to be bad, I have a feeling that I'll be sick of it by the time I'm done with the bomber. I'll add this to the list of overhyped and overpriced beers that I've had this week.
(Edit: It turns out I got sick of the taste before I even finished my first pour. Every sip tasted worse, and it seems like it is not a bad bottle. I originally scored taste and drinkability higher, but dumping an $8 bottle of beer is cause for me to rate it lower.) 1,156 charactersklewis, Mar 17, 2006

I have had a LOT of IPA's/Imperial (double) IPA's, and I must say that I have NEVER had a beer of this style taste better than Dreadnaught! This beer is so much in a league of its own. I love the grapefruit flavor to this beer. I am not sure what these folks use for hops, but I am guessing maybe Cascade, Amarillo, or Nugget. Take a whiff of this beer! I can't get over how floral it is. This is such a gem. The closest beer I have had in flavor to this one lately of a similar style is Troeg's Nugget Nectar, but this Dreadnaught would still take top prize in my book! Grab a bottle!

Poured into a pint glass, this outstanding brew pours golden orange with an out of this world aroma. Scents of orange rind, fresh hops, flowers, fresh hops, coriander and fresh hops abound throughout the start of this funky Imperial IPA. The tag line on the bottle reads "It's not Normal" and man is that right. It's not normal that a beer can be this good. It's rich, powerful, not overly heavy but round and clean on the finish. At 9.5% alc.it packs a punch, but I could see myself downing four of these in a night, all right. 562 charactersMattBrooks, Mar 15, 2006

4.5/5  rDev +2.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I'm often skeptical of a review that has the same score, across the board. This one happens to be very good, with respect to EVERY category (some pushing exceptional).
A: Golden-bronze, pours with an abundance of fluffy white head, decent retention, great lace. 
S: Plenty of American hops. Pine, grass, floral and a hint of citrus.
T: Predominantly American hops. But there's not too much citrus, it's a pleasant blend of pine & grass, with a little spicyness as well. The alcohol content is remarkably well hidden, with only a hint of sherry-like fruity alcohol flavour. 
Initially I was surprised by a sweet caramel flavour (43F fridge), but as it warmed up, the bitterness started to kick in. I agree that 50-55F should be the appropriate serving temperature. I'm generally not a temperature Nazi... but with this much bitterness (DIPA's in general), it's VERY important. 
M: Body is on the heavy side of moderate, slightly creamy, with some prickly acidity. Carbonation is moderate.
D: I like it a lot. The hop flavour is IN-YOUR-FACE, and hops aren't for everyone, but that's the DIPA style, there's really a pleasant blend of flavours here (nothing really overwhelms, or smacks you in the face). Only the alcohol content (and perhaps price) inhibits the "Chug-ability".
Thanks for picking this up Dave! 1,330 charactersDerek, Mar 14, 2006
4.6/5  rDev +4.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5A - it pours a perfect amber color, with a nice off-white head that dissapated rather quickly. It also left very little lacing. 
S - Strong aromas of pine needles, and a pink grapefruit note that turns to a pear/vineous smell. Very easy on the nose. 
T - The sweet grapefruit juice taste hits you right up front then turns into a smooth piney flavor that warms the middle of the tounge. The malt is in there, but it is tucked so far back that it is only noticeable as it warms up.
M - There is some slight carbination on the middle of the tounge as its in your mouth but as it swallowed it turns into a creamy chewy absolutely dangerous feeling of wonderment that is most pleasurable for this style of beer. 
D - For this style of beer ( being a Double IPA ) I couldnt ask for anything more from a beer. To a hop head this was the most enjoyable experience I have ever had. But since it is such a high ABV% it is a once a night thing. Or take it easy with the knowledge that this beer can do some damage and enjoy it for the rest of your life. 1,055 charactersquasimoto, Mar 08, 2006
4.97/5  rDev +13.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 522 oz Bottle purchased at Spiritus Fermenti in Providnce for $7.99.
This beer is absolutely delicious. Both the smell and the taste are dominated by piney, citrusy hops. The taste is balanced by a slightly sweet malt, but this beer is all hops. What makes this beer just remarkable is how smooth and drinkable it is for an insanely hoppy double IPA weighing in at 9.5% alcohol. I could seriously drink this stuff all night, every night. Kudos to Three Floyds on creating one of the best beers in the world. 509 charactersbignick, Mar 07, 2006
4.82/5  rDev +9.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I've been looking forward to tasting any Three Floyds beers and as a hophead I'm psyched to be trying this one. I thank fitzIPAtrick's kind generosity for the ability to do so. This beer kicks major @rse! The aroma and taste are so amazing that I just don't know which one I like better. The beer pours a clear copper/amber color with a nice creamy head. Of course, the smell is all hops - citrus, pine, grapefruit - to me anyway. The taste is an amazing fruity hopness and, believe it or not, a fine malt backbone as well. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with nice carbonation. For the sheer hop kick and high alcohol, this beer is surprisingly drinkable. Must...have...in...Mass. 680 charactersmcowgill, Mar 07, 2006
3.71/5  rDev -15.5%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 2.522 oz. bottle poured into a pilsner.
bright amber orange with half an inch of white head that falls quickly. head disappears completely after a few sips and leaves no lacing.
insanely hoppy, fantastic aroma. mainly grassy, but some intensely bitter grapefruit rinds and a touch of peachiness and aspirin. a faint hint of caramelly malts.
some sweet caramel malts in the flavor initially, but the hoppy bitterness overwhelms that quickly. dominating bitterness overwhelms any hop subtlety in the flavor, and definitely hurts the drinkability. alcohol is very well-hidden, but this is still a challenging beer; the hops will wear you out and it makes it tough to get through the full 22 oz. everyone should try this beer once, but maybe only once. 754 charactersPrufrock, Mar 06, 2006

served in an ommegang goblet from a twenty two ounce bottle at almost room temperature. 
 first smell was a wonderfly citrusy, mega hoppy aroma that fills the surrounding air.
poured a beautiful golden color with minimal carbonation and no head.very impressed with how drinkable this ipa was with the almost ten percent alcohol content and amount of hops. i am a hop head so it was right up my alley. great mouth feel and was surprisingly gentle on the palate. would definatley give this brew two thumbs up and would recommend it to anyone who loves a great ipa. 763 charactersjaxon53, Mar 02, 2006

Hazy golden color, off white head that starts off thick but quickly fades,
Smell: Holy shit. Citrus/Floral hops, candied apricots, mango, maybe a little ganja, toffee...What a delicious aroma. Ive never smelled anything like it. The aroma jumped out of the bottle the second the top was popped.
Taste: See smell comment above. Sweet, sticky, hoppy. This is a kick ass beer. Words cant do it justice. First I tasted green hops blended with that candied apricot flavor, mangoes, toffee...Wow. The ABV isnt evident at all. The hops are bitter but the sweetness behind them melt into perfect harmony. The finish is green, grassy, fruity, sweet, hoppy, bitter, sweet, fruity, hoppy....you get the idea. Super long finish where the taste just lingers and lingers. Devine, sublime, and flat out spectacular. The tastes blend perfectly, and play off each other brilliantly. One sip I get aprocits, the next I get grass, the next I get pine, the next I get mangoes... The most perfectly balanced beer Ive ever had. Simply stunning. This is the beer I want buried with me.
For a beer this big the mouthfeel doesnt feel too thick, but its chewy as hell. Hop oils make it slick as it goes down. Easy to drink? You bet. Does the drinkability suffer due to the high ABV? Hell no. I could drink this until I passed out.
I think this is deserving as the highest rated IPA in all the land, and I think its the best IPA Ive ever had. And its not even close. I thought DFH 90 was a perfect IPA, but this beer has made me change my tune. As much as I love DFH 90, this one takes the cake.

5/5  rDev +13.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 522oz. bottle poured into a pint glass. 
A: Pours to a deep amber with a slight haze, a decent off-white head that dissipates at a normal rate and leaves a think, even lace on the glass.
S: A great blend of hops and citrus. I was expecting a hops smell that would knock me over, but the orangey-tangerine sweetness makes the aroma very pleasing.
T: The sweetness in the smell makes you think it may be overly sweet but that is certainly not the case. Excellent heavy hops flavor as you would expect for the style with citrus and malt to balance it out. Theres almost no hint of the 9.5% ABV. The hops flavor stays in the after-taste (again, as expected) along with a bit of sweetness, which personally I havent found in too many beers of this style. The taste in each sip makes you crave the next.
M: Very crisp. Very smooth. Perfectly balanced. Medium-bodied. Light carbonation. VERY clean finish.
D: Since this beer has an excellent taste, hides the high ABV and is both smooth and balanced, Im giving it a rare 5 score.
When I found out about a place around here that sold stuff from Three Floyds I went there as soon as I could in hopes that this beer would be there. When I got there, they didnt have it, but assured me theyd be getting it. About a month later it arrived and I have to say it has lived up to all of the hype and made the wait worth while. If you have access to this beer, you owe it to yourself to at least try it and more than likely consume a great deal of it. 1,499 charactersTheManiacalOne, Feb 26, 2006
4.77/5  rDev +8.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Bright copper with bits of suspended particles and a very thin head that quickly forms a ring around the glass. You can smell this one from across the room - huge, oily, resinous, piney, citrusy - EVERYTHING. Very complex, multi-faceted aroma that could destroy your nose if you're not careful. Amazing sticky hop oil flavor packed full of juicy citrus fruits and a solid sweetness. My mouth is tingling - its almost as if I've been sucking on an orange rind. Definately full bodied and warming. This is very intense and strong yet I promptly inhaled mine like it doesn't cost $11 a bottle.
Not for the weak of heart...or nose, or tongue. The flavor just lingers forever. This is all about the hops...big, massive quantities of hops. Nothing can prepare you for this... 772 characterswedge, Feb 26, 2006
4.86/5  rDev +10.7%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Color is sparkling brass with some large bits of sediment floating around and small head with little retention. Though not to worry, I can smell this from miles away. Resinous explosion followed by huge pine, floral, earth, and citrus. Aroma of a coniferous forest surrounded by an orchard. Tantalizing. Vicous in texture and awesomely hopped. Pine like crazy. I can't even begin to fathom what's going on, but its along the lines of amazing. Mouthfeel is complex and full...perfect crisp medium carbonation. Velvety creamy and sticky sweet. There's no way a beer with such an awesome aroma and taste could have any drinkability problems.
Disappointed I had no head or retention with a semi-aggressive pour but everything else definitely makes up for it.
Faaantastic. 773 characterstastybeer, Feb 26, 2006

It pours a beautiful flax/gold with an off-white head that leads to solid lacing. 
The smell is huge hops. and laying in waiting...hops again. Citrus tones ride the hops and green it out a bit. Like Hop Wallop on "roids, and thats saying something! The taste is as expected, heavy and bodied hops supported by a warming malt backbone. This beer is an aniNimal. As it warms it just get more drinkable, and less raw. I love tasting it's changes.

4.32/5  rDev -1.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4I finally got to try this (thanks Beer Yard) and wanted to see if it lived up to the hype. It poured a clear copper with 1/2 inch white head. The smell indicates it will live up to the hype, citrus hits first then spicy and piney with some grassy smells thrown in. The taste starts off slightly bitter, then there are orange and grapefruit flavors floating around, with a bready background holding it all together. Good level carbonation leads to a smooth dry finish. I am surprised with all the hop flavors that it isn't oily, I guess that's one of the reasons it's rated so high. It definitely lives up to the hype; it knocks the 90-minute IPA out of the top IIPA spot for me. 678 charactersorsulacp, Feb 23, 2006
4.07/5  rDev -7.3%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5From a 22oz bomber. 
Appearance- Pours a light, one finger head with some minor foam surface. Scant number of bubbles makes their way from the bottme of beer to the top. Color is a slightly hazeyamber, copper, and burnt orange peel mix. 
Smell- A bouquet of flowers mixes with a citrus fresh fruit basket and some some fresh baked white bread. 
Taste- Starts out with some hop flower notes mixed with hawaiian bread notes. Then leads to a more acidic and citrusy hop profile. 
Mouthfeel- some moments of slightly sharp acidity, but never sour. This is an American Double IPA, so of course very bitter. When first tasted straight from the fridge, the palate had a somewhat syrupy texture, but still very refreshing. 726 charactersscruffwhor, Feb 22, 2006
4.75/5  rDev +8.2%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75An insanely delecadent IPA! At my initial thoughts, it must be extremely difficult to get that much flavor, hop bitterness, balance, and alcohol into such a smooth and easy drinking beer. But on the other hand, the taste makes me think it's effortless. This symbiotic relationship is the beauty of the beer.
The beer pours an innocent enough golden elixir with lively carbonation, a fluffy white head forms atop the beer and holds its structure without bragging too much. A nice look with good lacing, low legging... It's just a good IPA look.
Hop aromas are evident right out of the chute. Both bold and delicate, the hops show a perfumy orange zest, grapefruit, lemongrass and light, bright grassy freshness. Combined with the shadow of caramel and honey malts, the nose detects apricot, mango and pineapple. The beer is simply mouthwatering and irresistible in its overall scent.
Diving in, the flavor is a sublime blend of citrusy notes but without the acidity or earthiness that usually accompanies the hop flavor. Extremely delicate, beautiful and heavenly hop flavor never offends or reaches aggression. Malt flavor gives a great blend of caramelized barley, crispy breads, and light confectioner's powdered sweetness. Not overly complex in flavor; the beer knows what it is, and does it extremely well.
The body might be the most magical characteristic of the beer. The malt character seems extremely soft while giving a very crisp, malty creaminess up front, but the well-attenuated character gives it a dry and clean finish. The caramel, candied sweetness seamlessly disappears without any linger on the tongue; just a light citrusy hop linger that extends well into the next sip.
The beer is simply a delight. Dreadnaught is without question among the best of IPA on the market. 1,794 charactersBEERchitect, Feb 20, 2006
4.38/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Executive Summary: Well worth the $10.50 I had to shell out in a take-out joint. I may just go for the case.
Appearance: Pours a crystal clear orange-copper with a good head, and tremendous lacing.
Smell: Grass and citrus...classic DIPA aroma here. I need to market an air freshener...
Taste: Holy crap. This is hop juice defined. Fantastic grapefruit flavors up front against a barely present malt backbone. You can only 'taste" it by inferring what this would taste like without the balancing effect. Bitterness follows on the way down, just begging for another sip.
Mouthfeel: Just like DFH90 in this category. Liquid candy. Just how I like it in a DIPA.
Drinkability: Surprisingly drinkable. I could put away two bombers fairly easily here. 9.5% ABV is hidden beautifully. Flavors are so well balanced that you don't feel overpowered. 853 characterskpantz, Feb 11, 2006
4.82/5  rDev +9.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured a slightly hazed golden-toned copper color into a pint glass. Left a full finger foamy off white head that slowy declined to moderate glass-clinging lacing. Aroma is sweet and hoppy, slightly piny and citrus hops overwhelm the nose. Tastes absolutely perfect, hoppy as hell, tastes mainly of grapefruity citrus, yet excellently paired with an ideal sweetness of malt to back this superb hop profile. Leaves a tasty hop bitterness in the aftertaste that pushes for more of this IPA . Mouthfeel is on the lighter end of the spectrum, borderline medium bodied, moderate carbonation. Very drinkable brew, absolutely love it. Without a doubt will seek out again in the near future, with American Double IPA's being one of my favorite styles, this may be my new favorite beer. 777 charactersdanielocean03, Feb 03, 2006
4.45/5  rDev +1.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Yeah! Tipped a super clean pour for some crystal clear copper coloured joy juice. The colour of a pretty penny, only worth about nine hundred times more. Plus tax and deposit! The head blew up off a proper pour. A white pillow that crumbled in the alcoholic undertow. Appears to be properly carbonated with some fat and fast bubbles and some slow tiny ones. Lace clinging like frothy spit to a window. 
The nose is packed with some concentrated and mad funky hops. The smell is super grassy and herbal. A brisk and raw smelling hop smack. I imagine mulch mowing a huge field of freshly harvested hop cones and then scraping the undercarriage of the mower and dumping the chunks into the vat. Just some oily, resinous, juicy lupulin drippin, chunky old hunks of funk. Malt tones? I think not. Put some stank on it, Dready! You smelly bugger!
The flavour is not as assaultive as I was expecting after sniffing this bitch. It is very pleasant and dare I say precariously balanced? There is a malt base. Semi sweet. There follows a pronounced bitterness. The concentrated hop character of the nose wraps around my tongue and shows me the brutality the nose had foreshadowed only with moderation levied by the malt profile. Vaguely sweet for a flash, exaggerated grassy and herbal layers and maybe even some blunted pines in the backstretch. Then dry. Fairly impressive dryness at that. The after effects are a lingering acidity and a timid sweetness that moistens my palate again and implores me to take another sip. The complexity, a word that I never figured on using to praise such a powerhouse of a brew, seems to grow as the experience wears on. The hops show ever more dimension in flavour sip after sip. Just a killer brew.
The mouthfeel is spot on with a fat and sassy medium body that delivers the taste express mail. Boom.
Drinkability is great. This thing is p'raps describable as huge in stature before the alcohol is even considered. The consumption factor is still excellent. One glass threw me a mellowing hop glow and some warmth from the magic ingredient. The remainder of the bottle has me sitting here in bliss. In bliss, and wishing I could have done it more justice in my futile attempt to harness its attributes with words. If I had this off the tap, I would die on the spot. Wallop. 2,305 charactersSupaCelt, Jan 31, 2006

Big, big, very fresh nose of citrus: orange and lemon and grapefruit, oh my ! A very inviting aroma just makes you want to dive on in.
Big first impression of the taste: juicy. It's a big splash of sweet, juicy citrus, you may swear there's pulp in your teeth. Below all the fruit there is a solid undercurrent of caramely malt foundation, before the big crash of bitter balancing hops arrive with a big SNAP! Taste slowly recedes in mix of bitter and sweet juicy fruit. Did I say this was juicy ?
Nice slick mouthfeel. 9.5% ABV ? Could have fooled me. 
A pioneer in the IIPA category, it's reputation is well deserved. 794 charactersRonfromJersey, Jan 30, 2006

Aroma is almost all leafy hops... hints of cannabis leaves. There's a sweet side to it which is citrusy. The bitter rules out the sweet so it's almost definitely the ridiculous amount of hops in this (I'm not surprised... just stating...).
Big leafy taste. Sweet citrus. Very very bitter. Save me. The bitterness in this rocks me pretty hard. I'm not much of a hop head but I can definitely appreciate this great brew.
Great smooth feel. Nice dry very bitter palate that hangs around for a ridiculously long time. After a while I decided I'd had enough of the finish and drank some water and there were still faint hints of it. Wonderful. Many thanks highclassdrinker for this amazing beer. 761 characterstimtheenchanta, Jan 30, 2006

A: Vigorous pour leaves me with a slightly cloudy amber-honey colored beer topped by a mountain of frothiness. The head soon settles to about a thin 1/4 inch, and thick sticky lacing coats the glass as i drink.
S: Wonderful bouquet of sweet, pale malts, citrus peel and abundant lupulins.
T: Sweet right up front, and it lingers for a moment. A tidalwave of intense tangerine goodness asserts itself dominately. Very nice. A bit of alcohol in the middle too. Somewhere then about now you get a dose of spicy hops, although it's not very aggressive it completes the experience and marks the finish, which is a long one...
M: Resiny and creamy, with noticeable carbonation and a slight alcohol burn. Very good.
D: I thought i could put this down easily, but it sneaks up on you. Just over halfway through my bomber i'm feeling it (but, i did precede it with a DFH 90 min.) Deceptively strong, and the bittering effect does tend to take over after awhile... probably couldn't realistically goe more than one deep given the size.

This beer is pungent, the aroma leaps across the room. Tons of juicy grapefruits as well as some sharp pines.
The flavor is dominated by the grapefruit and pines but the bitterness holds back. A slick buttery sensation underneath along with some green tea notes which give a bit of sweetness. Finish is dominating and the bitterness really does its thing here.
The mouthfeel is excellent. Perfect carbonation and smoothness to this beer. Unbelievably smooth and creamy for the amount of hop flavor in here. I still felt the malts were a bit weak and that's why I didn't give it a perfect score.
Quite drinkable even with the strong bitter finish. Alcohol is not too perceptible, I couldn't believe it's 9.5%. I finished this bomber a little too quickly.
A great beer and one everyone should try. I really would like to try it on tap or atleast at its freshest point. A trip to the brewpub might be in order. 1,090 charactersgranger10, Jan 26, 2006

Pours a golden, reddish tan color with a small head and really nice sticky lacing.
Odor is full of hops and then some weird mango funkiness as well. My wife said she smelled peaches, like the menu insisted, but i didn't get that.
Taste was BLAM!! HOPS!!! now i got the peaches too, but mostly just a fucking celebration of hops. still somehow the hops didn't kill the beer.
Mouthfeel was prickly and very aggressive
Great drinkability. alcohol partially blunts the bitter hop punch after just a couple of swigs and the flavor is maintained so that's good all around.
yeah, i'd go for this again. i know it's in bottles so if i ever see it ill grab some. 702 charactersaforbes10, Jan 23, 2006
3.97/5  rDev -9.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5Mostly clear copper in color, with light carbonatin and a thinnish off-white head that lingers and laces the glass. This beer is dominated by a juicy, orangey hop aroma w/ hints of pine, accompanied bysome light caramel notes struggling to make themselves noticed. Firtst thing noticed in the mouth -- wow, this is pretty damn hot in terms of the alcohol. The hops are very piney, with some sharp grapefruit character as well.
Sweetness is big also, and swells in sugary presence as the beer warms. Eventually, the alcohol cools off (though perhaps its just my taste buds getting numb) but never drops completely off the radar. Fairly heavy in the mouth, and the sparse carbonation doesnt help. Overall, this is an alright beer, though it could definitely do with a little "time-out" before drinking. 805 charactersmzwolinski, Jan 20, 2006

A - Pours a clear light orange with a thin off white head and tiny strings of lace.
S - Piney, citrus, grapefruit hops that combine for a very nice perfumey aroma. Some caramel malt is in the background but the hops dominate this one.
T - Grapefruit, pine and citrus with a malt sweetness to provide balance. The intermingling hop flavors linger on the tongue for a while leaving a tropical fruit flavor behind.
M - Enough carbonation to tickle the tongue and enough hop resin to coat the mouth but not thick or oily.
D - Very good DIPA. Alcohol is hidden well but you still feel the warming effects. Extremely tasty and hoppy fresh but unfortunately I have had several bottles lately that have turned into bad barleywines. 741 charactersbrewcrew76, Jan 13, 2006

Appearance- Cloudy orange with a nice white head that clings like glue with each sip.
Smell- Hop goodness, spicy and citrusy. Oily pine with some sweetness behind it.
Taste- Fantastic. Like a distilled version of Alpha King. Huge grapefruit hops, pine, with tons of hops perfectly balanced by malt sweetness. Huge! 
Mouthfeel- Sticky and wonderful.
Drinkability- A perfect session beer (for those with few taste buds left), way too drinkable for the alcohol content. 590 characterskirok1999, Jan 02, 2006
4.89/5  rDev +11.4%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 522 Oz bottle Sampled through the efforts of SS 05 BIF and Meathookjones.
Pours a chill hazed orange to light brown colored ale which manages to even muster a small tan head despite the alcohol level.
Smell is a large and aggressive load of hops. A dazzling demonstration of all the scents that hops can provide in fact. Stronger less pleasant scents like willow trees (cat piss to me), eucalyptus, and menthol. Fruity scents mostly orange and lemons. Spices, allspice, basil and oak and black pepper. Even the expected grapefruit and pine scents are here. Once your nose can adjust to the hops there is a nice clean malt scent underneath. Alcohol fumes carry scents of citrus oils and black pepper.
Taste is mild and highly of citrus fruits in the beginning. Super mild in flavors for what this is, a damn strong beer. The flavor is all about light citrus nectars and some floral flavors, with a hardly harsh herbal finish. I can tell that the only Very light malts are used, as you can taste them clearly. Malt seems to be only the lightest malts and even possibly rice malt due to its lightness. Or maybe this beer has done a perfect "Jedi Mind Trick" on my senses?
Mouthfeel is good but light for the style. I can't really hold the light body against this beer, as it seems to be what this entire beer is meant to be.
Hard to be critical here; I can only sum up this beer in this way. Holy freaking crap! What a great beer! 1,441 charactersZorro, Dec 23, 2005
4.49/5  rDev +2.3%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4.5This bottle was brought back from Chicago thanks to my friend, Autumn. Great stuff.
The beer pours to a golden amber color with a thin white head. Carbonation is minimal, and the head doesn't leave much lacing.
The smell is intense. Very citric, with grapefruit and apricot hops. The malt is very sweet. This beer smells like candy.
The taste is very citric as well. Not too syrupy like some intensely hopped beers. Quite sweet. The bitter is not as intense as I thought it would be, but it is there.
As much as I enjoyed this beer, I can't quite decide whether or not it lives up to its hype. It carries quite a hefty price tag at that. I still love Three Floyds. This isn't the hopped up version of Alpha King that I was expecting, but a totally different beast. As much as I wanted a more intense Alpha King, I like that the brewers decided to mix it up. I would love another one, but I would have to drive 4 hours and pay another $10 a bomber. I'll pass for an Alpha Klaus if I end up making the drive. 1,018 charactersneonbrown82, Nov 28, 2005
4.72/5  rDev +7.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5I've waited. Ohhhh, how I have waited. And now, this dog has had his day. According to my fellow BA's, this beer is the King of my favorite style, the mighty and mystical American Double IPA. For years have I sought and failed. Then, through the good fortune of a trade with Beerbeing, the bottle was mine. I stared at the bottle for a week. And now I must have her. Now, studying for a financial exam that will allow me to get paid more money and give me some letters after my name, I decide it's time for a study break. It's time for Dreadnaught. 
Quite clear, a rich copper color with a frothy white head...the epitome of the style. Some are quite golden light, some are an amber brown. This falls in between, and the head retention is excellent to boot. 
Aroma...wow. Like burying my face in a handful of fresh, leafy hops, and tangerines dipped in grapefruit juice. This is hoppy. 
I've heard and read many a comment that this is uber-hopped, and make no mistake - it is - but it isn't a strip-the-varnish-off-a-foot-locker hoppy. It doesn't destroy your palate. Rather, the massive amount of hops blend with the seemingly enormous chewy malt profile that this also displays. Juicy, sweet, estery candied apples in the flavor. Oily resinous hops. A bit on the sweet side, but for me this is perfect...something I really enjoy in this style; having that sweet, juicy, like biting into fresh fruit sweetness is, to me, what makes a good DIPA a great DIPA. This one's got it. 
Carbonation is constant throughout, and there's not a lot of it. Just a tingle. Perfect. In the flavor, the alcohol is only slightly noticeable in the finish, though it's a belly warmer. 
This is straight-fuck delicious, as I've come to expect from this brewery. Certainly worthy of it's high ranking - however - this also makes me realize that more people need to try Avery Eleven, which, though not quite on par with this (the Avery is a bit more hop-weighted, so less balanced...but I like hops)...it's comparable. Thanks again to BeerBeing. 2,036 charactersIrishRedRock, Nov 19, 2005
4.89/5  rDev +11.4%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Holy fucking hell. This is damned close to IPA perfection, and by far the most balanced, well integrated DIPA i've ever had the pleasure to imbibe. This said, I give almost everything a 4 in appearance. Pours hazy dull yellow-orange with a nice white head that holds a respectable collar throughout, with some lacing. Smell is incredible, smells like fresh hops, completely fresh, green leafy hops, with a slight caramel undertone. Incredible, simply fantastic. The taste is like the smell x10. Fresh leafy leafy hops, oily hop essence, backed by a substantial, but not overly done malt body. If this brew has any faults, it could be just a tad less sweet, but it's pretty damned good all the same. Hop profile is like no other IPA i've ever had, terrific, and terribly hard to define. To me it's not citric, pithy or piney, like so many are, just fresh leafy greenness. Starts off slightly sweet across the palate then leafy green oily hops hops hops hops, slightly spicy hops through the finish. It's almost not bitter at all, not that bitter is bad, but this is hop essence sans bitter harshness, and it's awesome. Body is relatively full with with decent, but not strong carbonation, i wouldn't have minded a slight bit more. Drinkable? This is more drinkable than 95% of the IPA's I had that i drank before NC popped the cap. ABV is undetectable. Absofuckinglutely incredible. Second...perhaps third best beer I've had to date, and that's saying a mouthfull. My god, the hop burps after this ar eincredible.
Huge thanks to Beerbeing for this one. 1,554 charactersnumenor1, Nov 11, 2005
4.83/5  rDev +10%look: 3 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Holy freakin' crap! This beer is fantastic! Upon pouring, it doesn't look all that special, just a slightly cloudy, yellow-gold brew with a nice white head, but then you smell it. Oh man. This is by far the best DIPA that I've ever smelled. Very, very hoppy, just all over the place hops. The taste basically follows the ssmell, with a truckload of hops nicely balanced out by a good, but not overpowering amount of malt. A perfectly balanced beer. While I was getting cottonmouth from the extreme hops, and the beer was bitter, at no time did I want to stop drinking this beer. The malt does it's job perfectly. Wow. 
Best beer of the style, certainly. One of the best beers I've ever had? Without a doubt. 708 charactersshbobdb, Nov 10, 2005
4.65/5  rDev +5.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Clear orange amber with a good-sized light tan head. Sticky rings of lace were left around the glass. Big up front hoppy punch aroma with plenty of citric and piney hop notes coming on strong. Some nice floral notes and a solid sweet malt backbone with some light toasty notes as well. Flavor is equally big with plenty of strong hops and a nice big malt taste. Sweet caramel and toasty malts contend with the big bitter grapefruit notes. Piney resins with some earthiness. Perhaps a bit sweeter overall than I would like it but its damn tasty. Ends with a nice bitter sweet grapefruit bite. Pretty thick and hefty on the palette with some of the bitter tongue raking expected of DIPAs. Very drinkable stuff as well as it went down like a pale ale. Great brew that I wish was easier to come by. 796 charactersmeathookjones, Oct 31, 2005
4.6/5  rDev +4.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Pours a nice hazy gold color, white heads forms quickly and thickly, but fades almost as fast.
Smells amazing. Only slightly like I expected a double IPA this big to smell, mostly sweet honey and floral hops.
And it tastes fantastic! Sweet, mellow, and slick, with just a *hint* of a citrusy hop tang at the finish. Hop flavors are present throughout, with grapefruits, pine sap, and floral tastes all the way through. However, it's very subtle, and definitely compliments the malt, instead of dominating it. Stone breweries could learn a thing or two from this one.
Mouthfeel is thick, creamy, and full. Almost a chewy IPA, not at all like I expected a beer this light in color to feel. Leaves a very mildly bitter aftertaste, that gives way to a sweet honey/hops combination.
This stuff is scarily drinkable for its style, easily as drinkable as a hef or a lager. Just watch that ABV, it sneaks up on you. 919 characterswaldowin, Oct 31, 2005
4.6/5  rDev +4.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4thanks to orbitalr0x for the bottle!
hazy uninterrupted peach color.. bright with smooth and thin expressway of carbonation traveling toward the retentive 2-finger head in my alt glass. fades super slow leaving a crepe-like crust full of air bubbles on the side of the glass. the foam itself looks like vanilla cotton candy, both creamy and airy. aroma is fresh.. resinous green hops married with a vibrant cherry-like acidity. some silky, woody vanilla scents and fresh picked tobacco leaf. alot going on here. tastes unique for an ipa.. almost barrel aged but very subtle. pine finish with a bit of tea leaves and peach essence in the aftertaste. slight alcohol bite is expected and total background noise, nothing more. very drinkable due to its lack of standard DIPA abrasiveness. mouthfeel is as light as it should be carrying the weight of the flavor circus contained within. 
what else can i say? expected a huge, untamed monster and got a subtle, juicy, balanced and outside-the-box IPA that leaves me begging for another. first bottle i ordered on my pennsylvania brew tour after having this bottle just days prior. 1,130 charactersgoodbyeohio, Oct 26, 2005

it's always nice to try an IIPA that doesn't have the same effect as chewing on a piece of fresh-cut white pine
the color is very nice: a rosy amber color (like scotch? or cognac?), but there isn't much of a head, which should be expected at 9.5%
great aroma; i get a noseful of columbus and some sweetness too
incredibly bitter, but without sacrificing any degree of deliciousness. very complex; unlike with some IIPAs the hops don't have sore shoulders here 492 charactersbruachan, Oct 06, 2005
3.12/5  rDev -28.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 2.5 | feel: 2.5 |  overall: 2The beer pours brassy amber with a thick white head, which recedes to a thin cap. Each sip leaves a ring of lace on the glass. It is a very attractive beer.
The smell is an assault on the sensesin a good way. There is a little citrus in there, but I cant escape the peach. Each sniff is like cutting peach and shoving my nose into it. Ive never encountered this odor in a beer before. Interesting.
The taste is pretty good, I guess. Its sweet with a lot of peach flavor. The peach actually seems to dominate a bit too much in my opinion. I must admit I prefer Ruination to this as far as double IPAs go; the Dreadnaught seems a tad one dimensional in comparison. It is very tasty mind you, in its own way, but not something I think Ill be buying again anytime soonespecially at $8.99 for a 22 ounce bottle.
The mouthfeel is decent; it comes close to bordering on syrupy, but doesnt quite cross that line.
The drinkability of this beer is just OK. This beer is so sweet that after I finish this bottle, I will have had quite enough of it. Overall though, it is an easy sipper and Ill have to take it slow considering its high alcohol content. 1,169 charactersmaggotbrain, Sep 30, 2005
4.02/5  rDev -8.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Thanks to OldSock for this bomber, which I shared with my burgeoning non-BA roommate.
This brew is a deep orange hue with a nice light white head. The aroma of freshly mown grass fills my nostrils from the first sip to the last. On the tongue, though, it turns to intense resin/pine cone. So much so that I had trouble finishing it. Lots of caramel, alcohol quite present. 
Overall: certainly not the regular west coast mix of hops. I think the hop flavor is a bit one trick and hard to keep down. I'd definitely give it a second try, as perhaps I am just not used to this hop mix. 587 charactersoggg, Sep 22, 2005
4.77/5  rDev +8.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 509/15/05- Purchased via mail order through Archer's Liquors in Chicago.
Presentation- 22oz bomber bottle poured into a Duvel tulip. No freshness dating, but it ws from the latest batch this year.
Appearance- Golden-orange colored elixer. Nice 1/2 inch creamy and stark white and frothy head. Good lacing.
Smell- Where do I start....this was by far he best smelling beer, actually, check that...the best smelling anything that has ever come before my nose. Very hoppy in the nose. You can tell it's going to be bitter, but not to the extreme. Very little pine scent if any at all. The majority is a cornucopia of fruit. Imagine going to a country fruit stand where they have all these fruits cut open and the fragrance wafting into the air. At first a heavy dose of grapefruit is deteced, followed by some lemon, orange and maybe even some melon scents. But, the best part was after the beer had sat in the glass for around 30 minutes. The smell of fresh cut peaches was overwhelming. I literaly sat on the couch with my nose stuffed in my Duvel for about 30 minutes. Freaking incredible. They need to make candles out of this stuff.
Taste- Decent bitterness with a light malt background. Touch of pine flavoring in the hops, but the majority is fruity hops. The taste obviously isn't as good as the smell (or else I would be moving to Munster, IN and pouring this stuff by the gallon into a humidifier.) Maybe a touch of a roasted grapefruit flavor as well. Extremely tasty. 
Mouthfeel- Perfect carbonation for an IPA. Slight creamy mouthfeel with a nice sugar coating as well.
Drinkability- This one is a damn special beer. Phenomonal scent with a damn good flavor as well. Probably the second best overall IPA2 I have ever had. Right up there with Hop Juice from Oggi's. This one isn't as bitter, but has a better scent. Highly reccommended. Getting more for sure. Kinda expensive on the pocketbook though. I think I paid $10.95 for it. Well worth it though. 1,978 charactersGClarkage, Sep 16, 2005

The mouthfeel was a medium build, with a pleasant film left on your tongue. Overall this is an excellent beer.

A: Nothing fancy here light golden hue, with tiny head that disapeared almost instantly, light carbonation.
S: Hops, wheat (where did that come from?) some sweet malt notes, followed by phenals
T: Smelled, just like it tasted, I expected a huge hop whollop, but I was disapointed right away, it was weak and flat, not what I wanted at all. it had this funky tasted that wasn't right, I think it hadn't survivied the plane ride unfortunatly.

Aroma is wow heavenly, loads of juicy citrus grapefruit mingled with pine resin and floral hops this one smells so good hop heaven in a glass. All of these hops riding on a lightly sweet bready malt base. 
Taste is huge on hops loads of hops big citrus grapefruity hops. Lots of pine bittterness noted but not overly so, mingles with some herbal hops to round out this onslaught. Loads of hops in this one but it still doesn't taste out of balance the lightly sweet bready malt sneaks in and adds some flavor. So smooth so enjoyable the aroma relaxes you the flavor takes you to nirvana.
Mouthfeel medium full large amount of hops packed into this smooth crisp brew.
Drinability is great a huge tasting I2PA but crisp and clean hides the alcohol content well. Want to thank cretemixer for this bottle and the pints out of the growler, a wonderful beer one to seek out and buy. If I could purchase this one it would be my I2PA of choice pricey yes but worth it. 1,126 charactersmntlover, Sep 01, 2005

Pours an amber color with a big billowy 2" fizzy tan head leaving some cling on the glass...very clean appearance. Dissipation leaves a nice surface layer.
Aroma is super cascade hoppy! Lots of pine trees. Lots of alcohol hits my nose also. Not too exciting to be honest. 
Taking a sip, I notice lots of pine hops with a nice buttery feel. Some sweet grapefruit escapes onto my palete as well and it finishes well with a nice slightly drying alcohol finish. I also notice the taste of rock candy as an aftertaste...wonderful for the style. 
Very well balanced out carbonation in that it is not big like some IPAs I've had in the past. A nice medium-bodied brew with a nice buttery smoothness that goes a long way. 
Drinkable? OH, HELL YEA! This gives the Dogfish 120 minute IPA a run as my favorite IPA of all time, and may take over that spot. Just an awesome brew!!! 951 charactersFish113d, Aug 30, 2005

 Has a clear copper color with a light yellow head. Medium bodied and smooth. Taste starts with a nicely bittersweet hop assault on the taste buds followed by a good dose of malts which add a light caramel sweetness. But this brew is about the hops; as it warms the flowery and grapefruit hops emerge and make for a nicely bitter, crisp and clean finish.
One of the best Imperial IPA's out there. 589 charactersbeerceller99, Aug 28, 2005

If an artist, 100 years from now when MillBudco, a subsidiary of AOL Time GE Virgin MegaCorp, makes the three types of beer Americans are allowed to buy and people want to take a look back into the dark ages at what beers used to look like, he'll paint this.
Smells like bready yeast and perfect hops. Grapefruit and pine and pumpkin pie spice. 
Tastes very much like Alpha King, only with a harsher hop finish and more yeast in the front. This might be the hoppiest beer I've ever drank. It's incredidly intense, yet remarkably easy to drink.
Wonderful beer. 599 charactersmynie, Aug 27, 2005

Copperish tones, with red highlights, large fluffy bubbly head.
Major grapefruit up front in the nose, overtop of pine and a little straw, and some nice bready malt.
The flavor is insanely wonderful, this is as close to hophead beer nirvana as I have been privy to yet. Bitter citrus notes hit hard, and then hang on, but there are other flavors to be sampled throughout the sip. Nice sweet caramelly or sugary taste that really compliments the hops nicely.
Mouthfeel is simply stunning - no hot throat or even warm tummy. Sort of sits in your mouth, on your tongue and even down the top of your throat for a long time as each sip slowly fades away...
Only drinkability issue is finding more of this to sip on.... 879 characterslostbearbrew, Aug 24, 2005

One big whiff, kicked in the face with big time malt and big time hops. Hard to tell on the appearance since 3F serves in crappy plastic cups. Notes of caramel, bread, bisuits, citrus.

4.67/5  rDev +6.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Clear amber with a thick, bright white head. Very good retention, with foam remaining in the glass at the end, and it left a heavy layer on the inside of the glass. You could smell this one as soon as the cap was popped... Pine, pine, pine, like walking in a pine forest, but very clean. There's also a bit of faint malt hiding back there as well. Some malt sweetness and a pine/citrus hoppiness to start with an aggressive bitterness. Light alcohol flavour and warmth creeps in at the middle and continues through the finish. The pine flavour really hits you after you swallow and stays quite strong for a long time. The only complaint would be that it's a bit one dimensional as far as hop flavours go, but that's a very minor complaint. Smooth, moderately low carbonation. Moderately full body, a bit creamy and viscous. Overall, a world class DIPA with excellent balance for the insane hopping rate. Definitely a beer to seek out and experience. Just don't expect to be able to taste anything afterwards. Thanks Viggo! 1,022 charactersDrJay, Aug 20, 2005
4.19/5  rDev -4.6%look: 5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4What no better way to review your first beer then reviewing one that is such highly regarded. A friend and I split the last case at Three Floyds, so I feel very grateful.
Apperance: The Dreadnaught is an amber orange, and reminds me of leaves in the fall. The head is a nice full white; a stable, as bubbles gallop to it. A beautiful beer just to look at.
Smell: The Dreadnaught wears a strong cologne of grapefruit, maybe its only flaw to me, as it is overwhelming. 
Taste: A sweet first taste reminds me of a carmel/maple mix, and then the hops kick in with the grapefruit. Unlike the smell, the grapefruit provides a nice, mature touch. A slight bitterness in the aftertaste, that stays a little longer than desired, but despite this a craving to sip a little more, and a little more, and a great more, is what you are left with.
Mouthfeel: Feels very good in the mouth, more thin than thick; light liquid satin, moves easily in the mouth. A dry brew because of its alcohol content.
Drinkability: Overall very nice, and filling. The taste hides the alcohol content very well, but it cannot hide it from your body. At the halfway point in this bomber I can feel its affects.
A superb beer and worthy of its reputation. 1,238 characterspetrochile, Aug 16, 2005

Poured a clear golden copper with a lasting white head.
Great hop aromas hit right out front: citric, herbal, coniferus, and awsome. A sweet malt base with a touch a buttery toffee tries to keep up.
Medium-full body with a oily mouth coating and a pleasant carbonation. I have to admit it; I'm a sucker for the combination of Warrior and Amarillo hops: a hard to pin down citrus taste along with an earthy, pungent herbal twang equals big time flavor and enjoyment. An almost syrupy malt sweetness and very well hidden alcohol made this super drinkable.
After wading through quite a few lacking DIPA's, I finally found one that was excellent. A new favorite; complex, balanced, and just down right tasty. 737 charactersShultzerdugen, Aug 15, 2005

Smell is like strolling through a pine forest while inhaling hop resin, some malt is detectable though. The taste is all PINE, insane pine all over, as your taste buds are destroyed the substantial malt character begins to show itself, and the end of the beer is very balanced, with a nice caramel sweet maltiness offsetting the huge hops. Mouthfeel is very full, with perfect carbonation. Any beer that is hoppy enough to be painful must be good, this beer is corrosive, but oh so good. I want a Dreadnaught IV. 601 charactersViggo, Aug 15, 2005
4.27/5  rDev -2.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Yet another fine creation from Three Floyds. Ahhh, the nose, the delight of big pine oils - spruce - (pine of a midnote vs. the divine loft of silver pine); this married with sweet of both malts and pine resin, a delicate but detectable citrus mix, softened with a mere touch of butter. This Dreadnaught poured a hazed (cleared midway through) golden orange with a hard pour settling to a 2 finger creamy topping. Ten minutes let it rest to a creamy wash. The up-spring of carbonation held fast for half a pint and rested. Sweet malts begin the taste (suprised me) with a hasty following of hops as they hit the first third of the tongue and reside on the roof - sticking. They remain there to enjoy for a near endless time, sometimes yielding to a bitterness. Somewhere in here the taste and dryness of grapefruit compliments. The alcohol is well hidden yet in time comes up in the physical.
Thank you Frank (Beerguy) for sharing such a gem. 945 charactersyoko, Aug 14, 2005

Cornucopia of aromas: oranges, lemons, ripe mellons, pineapple ad infinitum . .

Flavors of sweet orange pulp, tart lemon filling, ripe peach pulp, sweet honeydew ad infinitum. . .
A solid malt profile is destined to being overwhelmed as this masterpiece showcases its vibrant volatiles across the palate. IIPA ambrosia (or dextrinous mouthfeel with slightly syrupy medium body if you will). My mind flashes molecular ring structures of Humulene, Myrcene, Farnesene, Linadool . . . . . ad infinitum

Pours a bright peach/apricot color. Extremely impressive 2 finger cap of large bubbled foam--almost like egg whites beaten to soft peaks, resides on top of my glass. Impressive head retention as this fades very slowly. There is a tremendous amount of thick foamy lace left in concentric rings around the sides of the glass.
Strong piney citrus hops presence. I am guessing maybe those Warriors are wielding their force. I'm sure there are other hop varieties present and I could be wrong about the Warriors but this seems to be the one that is the most pronounced. This is not a bad thing. There is also a quite noticeable maltiness present-typical of any good double IPA. 
Taste is caramellized barleysugar with that strong piney citrus hop combo going on. Delicious. This is exactly what this style beer is supposed to taste like and it does deliver in everyway. There is an initial bite of wood, followed by malty honey--then a hint of rye and then hops and more hops. It finishes a little sweet but not overly sticky. No noticeable alcohol heat but there is so much going on here that you know these are high abv.
Mouthfeel is velvetty and excellent. Not real drinkable on a hot night in August-even with A/C blasting. I could see drinkability improving on this one as the weather cools. 1,355 charactersrousee, Aug 10, 2005
4.32/5  rDev -1.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4A clean amber/orange beer. Has a nice bubbly white head with some nice lace. The aroma is all hops with atleast two distinctive hop characteristics standing out. The first is a bittersweet grapefruit. The second is a peppery spicey hop and the two armwrestle for equal time. The peppery hop hits your mouth first and slowly gives way to a sweet malt note that quickly segues to the bittersweet grapefruit finish. 412 charactersybnorml, Aug 03, 2005
5/5  rDev +13.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Nothing surpasses the joy I feel when a new batch of Dreadnaught hits the local stores. Well, almost nothing. If you are planning to consume this beer it must be poured into the proper glassware. If you do not have this, wait to consume the beer.
 Poured into a tulip of course, this beer is orange, with an inch of white head. It fades, but maintains a small head. Some lace clings to the glass. 
 It has been far to long since I have enjoyed this smell. I could get a similar effect from sniffing a pine cone. Some citrus is thrown in there as well. This is the finest nose of any IIPA I have encountered. I feel the same way about the taste. There is a barrage of piney, citrus infused artillery, with a single burst of sweet, caramel malt fire in the midst of all that. 
 The mouthfeel is lightly, very creamy. That is not a typo. Drinkability is high. I use that word often, so to be more specific, I have been known to drink three of these in a night. I'm just rambling here, but wine connoisseurs pay a lot more for a comparable amount of the finest wines in the world, however, many breweries put out equally world class beers at considerably less price.
 Edit: I must blame my 4.5 appearance score the last time on a dirty glass. Tonight's pour into a thoroughly rinsed glass yielded the two inch head and blanketing lace that I expect from IN's finest. 1,374 charactersSephiroth, Jul 23, 2005
4.47/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4This poured from the bottle a deep copper color with a thick cream colored head. The head retention on the beer was astounding, it stuck around forever. The nose has tons of hop. Every possible character of an over the top hop beer. Hop flower, grass, fresh cut hay, pine and a ton of grapefruit citrus come across in the nose. The taste has an almost orange hop flavor that morphs into the expected grapefruit. The pine character remains and provides a sharp bitterness on the side of the tongue. Malthmmm whats that? There is a defined sweetness, a mild caramel on the finish, a slick mouth feel and a nice alcohol warming. The drinkability is good, not great, but this beer is still a wonderful experience. 713 characterscarln26, Jul 19, 2005

4.05/5  rDev -7.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Poured into a snifter, a mildly hazy light orange. Nice head and good lacing. 
Smells hoppy. Really pungent with piney hop resins and a citrus bomb in the nostrils. 
Goes in super smooth, especially considering the hops. Oily pine and citrus with a strong malt to back it up. Super sweet, leaves and oily sweetness on the lips that is delightful. Really hoppy, but definitely one of the tamer double IPAs I have had. The hops did not seem excessive and were well balanced. The alcohol is barely noticable. 
Pretty good. Not world class and it doesn't come close to some of the west coast IIPAs (Pliny the Younger, Hercules, etc.) but it is damn good and has many qualities that make it unique. Not another ultra hopped out beer, there is craftmanship and care behind it. 779 charactersaxisjones, Jul 07, 2005

This is the 4th of a group of three floyds that my brother brought home from Indiana. Saved it for the 4th of July. Was very pleased with the other 3. Poured a golden/orange color with considerable chill haze and minimum head. The chill haze dissipates as the beer warms which confirmed that it was chill haze and not floaters from being bottle conditioned. Leaves nice lacing. Smell is all hops and lives up to what i was hoping for. Taste however just didn't deliver. Overly sweet caramel flavor that overpowers the hops. Alchohol is well hidden. Overall just did not live up to what i was hoping for. I have another one in the cellar and will re-review if my opinion changes. 718 charactersbeermanbrian, Jul 05, 2005
4.53/5  rDev +3.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Bomber obtained by a buddy from the brewery in spring 2005 and consumed about a week later (review recorded on paper). Pours a two finger off white head over slightly cloudy and light orange or copper colored liquid. Smells of grapefruit pith, gentle pine needle, and apricot. Much more fruity than I was expecting. Tastes is rich sweet with nice grapefruit bitter. Not too rough of the grassy co-humulone but certainly enough to intrigue. The hops hit front and high, then they drop lower and to the back of the mouth. Great bitter with a nice aromatic hoppy aftertaste. Fruits are gentle and consist of apricot and (with reaching) some pear. Really nice mouthfeel, it's not just thick, it's thick like an oatmeal stout. Carbonation was moderate to md-heavy. The best offering I've had from 3F. 795 charactersmentor, Jun 14, 2005
4.55/5  rDev +3.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4App: Deep, deep orange and cloudy with a thick white head that laces the glass.
Smell: So pungent you can smell it across the room. Beautiful pine hops, malt, and citrus. Some alcohol and orange. Amazing nose.
Taste: Hops up front but very well balanced by a thick malt backbone. There's caramel there as well and a dry finish with a light alcohol presence. Very deep and rich.
Mouth: Thick yet smooth. Perfect amount of carbonation.
Drink: It's definitely good for a 9.5% DIPA, but you couldn't have more that a few glasses.
Overall: It's this and yulesmith as far as I'm concerned for the top of the heap in IPA's. Just amazing amount of depth and complexity of flavors. It's smacks you in the face with hops, yet it's so well balanced with depth. You need to find this beer. 792 charactersejquin, Jun 06, 2005
4.59/5  rDev +4.6%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Had this from a 22oz bomber I bought for $10 at the Northeast Taproom in Reading, Pa. I'm always a little anxious when I buy something at a bar because you never know how old it is. The bottle was not dated, but I figured this beer would age well, anyway.
The beer is a nice light orangey color, a little hazy, with an off white head with slightly large bubbles. Evident carbonation. The head dropped to a coating over the beer in @ 3 minutes. I love orangey IPA's! Very slight laddering appeared as I sipped. Couldn't really count the sips, though.
The smell is just awesome. Strong citrusy, floral hops, maybe a hint of cherries, malt aroma in the back; alcohol comes through also. My mouth actually watered while smelling this beer!
The first flavor is hops out the wazoo. Grapefruit, lemons, maybe some pine, earthy-like. Malt sweetness matches the hops wonderfully. Got a slight raisony flavor, maybe from caramel or Munich malt? For the style, this beer is absolutely balanced.
The mouthfeel was great. Tongue coating resins, carbonation tickle, and a warm, fuzzy feeling at the end from alcohol.
As for drinkability, I would drink this every day if my wallet (and my liver) could afford it. One of the best beers I have ever had the pleasure of drinking. 1,278 charactersjakester, Jun 04, 2005

Ahahahahahahahahaha! Words will not describe this brew. It is utterly awesome. 
Appears a cloudy dark gold with a luscious white head. Tons of thick lacing stick to the glass all over the place. These guys know what they're doing.
Smell is of biscuity malts, grapefruit, and tons of complex hops all on a bed of white chocolate. 
I can't even describe this complex taste properly. Imagine a stickier version of all the smells I just described with a resinous, lip smacking taste. Delicious! 
Mouthfeel is full with plenty of balance. I can't even put it into words. Just do it...do it.
Finger licking good...and then some!! 664 charactersweeare138, May 25, 2005

Aroma is totally dominated by floral hops of the kinds I wish we would see more of. Taste is very particular and not what I expected or what I had taste before in other Imperial IPA. Delicate floral sweet hops on top of well balance malt. Body is full and alcohol is well hidden. Not the malt and hops overpowered monster I was expecting but more of well balance and extremely enjoyable beer. 499 charactersPhyl21ca, May 24, 2005
4.32/5  rDev -1.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4So, would those be Amarillo hops lending definition to the aroma? Smells delicious, with a fair measure of bubblegum. Shows refined clarity with slow CO2 and a soft beige head. 
Dreadnaught is a muscular balance of honey sweet malts, sensible bitterness, and strong alcohol. The hops are not overplayed and that sharp bite of alcohol really suited my mood. I was going to cellar this for a while, but it appears to be heavily filtered and not bottle conditioned, so Im glad I didnt wait. Special thanks to cmaruschak. 525 charactersRedDiamond, May 16, 2005
4.59/5  rDev +4.6%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.5This was an incredibly fresh draft version consumed right at the brewery. It is deceptively light in color for a beer of this character. The head is not big, but forms a nice tight lacing. The smell and taste are dominated by a huge flowery hops and sweet malt. It was so fresh and hoppy on tap. The mouthfeel is great, well rounded and substantial. The drinkability mainly suffers due to ABV. Otherwise it is very drinkable, just don't drink too many. 452 charactersbigbubba, May 02, 2005
4.57/5  rDev +4.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Slightly hazy apricot colored, with a full inch of lumpy meringue sitting on top of the glass. It recedes to about a half inch, and there it sits and waits for me.
Aroma of sweet fruits and that slight metallic tinge that signals to me that this one's got some horsepower under the hood - 9.5%, I had no idea. Aroma draws me in, sweet bready malt hand-in-hand with the citrusy hop, plus some butterscotch, cinnamon, and cotton candy.
Chewy and full mouthfeel, just a little tingly, leads to a rich and complex flavor of tangerine citrus, sweet and bready (but not cloying) malt, orange peel bitter, ripe pear and candy. Faint undertones of toffee and pine, and a tingly finish that's part carbonation and part piney hops. Long, swirling legs of lace creep down the glass.
There's a reason this beer is BA's #16, and BuckeyeNation is the man for sharing this beauty. 868 charactersfar333, Apr 17, 2005
5/5  rDev +13.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Flowing from the 22oz bomber, this hazy ale fills my snifter with a very attractive deep orange. About a finger of head rises to top off this beautiful brew. Oh yeah, this is what an IPA should smell like! Lots of citrous aromas dominate the nose. Very clean piney hops add to this powerful aromatic experience. The smell is completed by a little caramel and malt. The taste is wonderful. Hops are quick to attack the palate with sharp citrous and pine notes. The hops are wonderfully potent, but amazingly not overpowering. Sweet caramel and malt flavors form a solid backbone for the taste. There are some spices present that dance with the hops and tantalize the tongue. This is IPA on a Biblical level! Mouthfeel is big, creamy, and smooth - at the same time staying sharp from the hops. Residual hop oils coat your mouth and provide a bitter dry finish, although some of the malt and spice also stick around. Alcohol, although slightly warming, is well hidden in the taste. Wonderfully drinkable, I want to drink Dreadnaught until the day I die. I was a little skeptical about paying $9 for a bomber, but I wish I would have bought everything the store had! 
Damn, this is the standard by which all IPAs will be forever judged. I cannot say a single bad thing about this beer. I have always been leary about handing out 5's for a beer, but this brew has honestly earned it. If you can find a bottle, pick it up, you won't be disappointed. 1,446 charactersBeerFink, Apr 02, 2005
4.12/5  rDev -6.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 422 oz bomber.
Pours a very clear almost sunset orange. Fluffy white head, with great retention and lacing.
Smell is overwhelming really (in a good way). Hops by the bale. Earthy, cirtusy, piney...however else you want to describe it, this things got some hops in it! Sweet malt and caramel are also present. Also a bit of buttery diacetyl.
Taste is also very heavily laden with hops, but very nicely balanced with a sweet malt and caramel backbone. Nevertheless, this is a hop bomb if there ever was one. Alcohol is present, but is well hidden by all of the other flavors.
One thing that I wasn't too thrilled with in this beer is the buttery aftertaste. I'm not really fond of diacetyl in my IPAs, but that's just one man's humble opinion.
Overall, a fine example. 770 charactersLuckySevens82, Apr 01, 2005
4.6/5  rDev +4.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5I started out wondering why I was paying $11 for a 22 oz beer, and ended up wishing I'd bought a second one. Pours nicely out of the gate, a little more than light amber in color, thick, and with a nice creamy head. Smell was great...grapefruit citrus aroma characteristic of Alpha King, but both richer and smoother. Satisfyingly thick mouthfeel that begs you to savor the brew before swallowing. Those who can hold off on that are rewarded by huge citrus, with maybe a hint of pine. With the finish, the hops kick in, but in a completely accessible way...not sweet and bitter but not, if that makes any sense. 
Highly recommended. Even those who are just making their way into the realm of highly hopped ales will appreciate this one. 739 charactersloganmule, Mar 29, 2005
4.82/5  rDev +9.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Crystal clear, light amber with a minimal but creamy looking head, that rebuilt itself with each sip, leaving a bit of lace behind. Slow and steady streams of bubbles were visually evident. From the second I opened the bottle, I was blasted by massive aromas of grapefruit and orange blossom honey. Sticking my nose into my imperial pint glass revealed big-time apricot and pine sap. I couldn't wait to try it and then, goddamn, I said goddamn! Hugely spicy and super sweet all at once. The bittering dries the mouth and builds gradually and lasts until who knows when; I couldn't wait long enough to find outthis stuff is top notch. Another gulp. Sweet, honey-laced grapefruit pith. A pine tree that offers grapefruit instead of pine cones. A perfect balance of malt and hops, that although powerful, neither is too aggressive. There's always something that balances the other out. The mouth was unbelievable. Fine carbonation coupled with a medium-thick, slick body contribute to an amazingly delicate feeling on the tongue; it's as if someone draped a piece of silk across my tongue. The mouthfeel and taste combo easily garners a perfect score. I always question the price of 3F beers in my area but this one was well worth it. Glad I bought two. 1,252 charactersoxmasterscream, Mar 26, 2005

Pours a fantastic orange...real cloudy, the way I expect my IIPA's to look. Two full fingers of creamy tan head...lacing is perfect...tons of clingy webs...head is going nowhere.
Aroma is beautiful...piney citrus eminating from the glass. A touch of cotton candy and tropical fruit as well.
The taste is a semi-sweet explosion of hops and malt..can't say it is one-sided at all, although the bitterness that sucks away any moisture in my mouth makes me think the hops will win the battle.
It is as if they squeezed in a Florida orange in each bottle.
The carbonation is perfect for its style and it is quite refreshing. Thick, syrupy mouthfeel...bittersweet aftertaste that makes you crave for more.
One of the most highly drinkable 9+% ABV brews I have ever had...up there w/ Victory's Storm King.
All the hype this brew receives and I must agree w/ the masses...the best IIPA out there. 964 characterswarriorsoul, Mar 26, 2005

Smell is citrus hops, but it's so thick and juicy, there's grapefruit, some pine, and a good helping of sweet malt in there as well. It's a huge smell, but it's a nice one. 
Flavor is sublime. Obviously there's a huge hop presence, but the malt backbone is assertive as well. There's quite a bit of citric fruitiness with a nice sweetness, too. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, especially for the high ABV. Lot of pine in the flavor as well.
This is truly a great one, even if it's a bit expensive. It's too huge to drink every night, but on special occasions I can't imagine a better brew. 782 characterswhartontallboy, Mar 20, 2005

Appearance: Copper, like the color of fermentation tanks. 1-2 fingers thick, sticky head. Clings to the glass. Very clear, no haze at all with a careful pour.
Smell: Man alive, I feel like I just opened a bag of fresh hops and dove in for a whiff. I half expect to see little yellow lupulin sacks floating in it. Piney, sharp cheddar. Beautiful.
Taste: Fantastic. Fresh hop, long, lingering bitter aftertaste, but not that "overhopped", out of balance flavor that a lot of these double IPA's are afflicted with. The best word for the overall taste is harmony between hop character and malt sweetness. I don't get a hint of alcohol, which is scarey.
Mouthfeel: Creamy and smooth, too easy for the alleged 9.5%
Drikability: Again, too easy. This just goes down and feels good.
Notes: This is fast becoming my favorite style and this may have leap-frogged Victory Hop Wallop as my number 1, though the price is somewhat prohibitive. ($79 for 12 x 650cc bottles). 1,075 charactersluvND, Mar 03, 2005

Smell: The smell is of glorious hops. The alcohol is hidden very well, and the hops are full and fragrant.
Taste and Mouthfeel: The flavor is full of hops. Floral, citrus and other notes come to mind as the hops bitterness leaves a lingering dry aftertaste. The alcohol is diguised well, and doesn't interfere with the hop-play. The mouthfeel is creamy.
Drinkability and Overall: The DIPA is not my favorite style, but this is pretty killer. The hops are just right, and don't mix badly with the alcohol. Three Floyd's continues to impress me. Can't wait to try some more. 660 characterssantoslhalper, Mar 02, 2005

CITRUS!!! wow, grapefruits, lemons, limes, oranges, pine mint, damn near every hop aroma you can imagine. Just wonderful on the nose. Wow, this is not as bitter as I imagined. There is a very nice caramel malt backbone to this one. The sweetness is balanced by the magnificant hop flavor. Super citrus taste, but not in the puckering grapefruit manner. More of a citrus spectrum. Moutfeel is creamy, and highly drinkable for the octane on this one. I would love to drink this one more, but at the $9.99 price tag my wallet would be very mad at me. Please lower the price on this one to something more reasonable and I wont drink anything else 765 charactersbnuttz, Mar 01, 2005

Smell: The smell is of really oily hops, especially grapefruit and other tropical fruit.
Taste: This is good (but really not exceptional). I taste a really pungent boquet of hops that run the gammut from bitter pine to sugary sweet orange to tart grapefruit to tangy mango. Very tropical, and very slick. Bitterness is high, but not offensive. This beer is something unexpectedly cohesive. The malts stick in there to give balance to the hop extravaganza, and the end result is a flavorful hophead's dream. I like this more and more as I drink it.
Mouthfeel: It's partly the fault of the resinous hops, and partly that of the large malt bill used to up this into imperial alcohol range, but this starts to cloy. It's to be expected, but not quite endearing. Bitter hops burn themselves on the tongue, love it or hate it.
Drinkability: Overall I liked it, and I had no problems polishing off the bomber. For the price however, there are better double and Imperial IPAs, and the genre is growing by the day. Stoudt's makes an eerily similar double IPA for 1/5 th the price. Not quite worth the hype, this is still a nice beer. 1,253 characters99bottles, Feb 28, 2005

Appearance: deep golden amber color that is perfectly clear with lots of tiny bubbles and a thick amber hued foam. Head last for days and is very dense. Nice lacing on the glass after each sip.
Smell: The strong smell of fresh green hops hits my nose during the pour. Very bright hops not really grassy not really citrus.
Taste: crystal malt is present a strong base then a blast of hops with a citrus presents at the end. A slight bit of warmth follows the hops, but when I exhale it is all hops on my breath.
Mouthfeel- smooth beer with just a hint of hop astringency. The alcohol warmth is just right in this beer. 
Drinkability: The hops are fresh and delicious. It has enough malt base to give the hops a leg to stand on but its not overly malty. Which is what I like to see in this style. 832 charactersrhoadsrage, Feb 21, 2005

Pours out bright golden amber and sits a lightly hazy amber-orange in the glass with bright ruby sides and a large off-white head. Big thick lacings all around, leaves a good skim on the surface all the way down.
Smells thick and malty, sweet caramel all over the place. Hops bring out the best in oranges and tangerines. Spicy notes of alcohol in the back. Mild fruity esters of pears and canned peaches come out from behind the jungle of aromas.
Tastes lightly sweet up front with good, rich maltiness. Hopping stays constant throughout providing a sharp, nearly citric tang with hints of oranges and grapefruit on the sides. The alcohol can't wait to make it's presence known as it steps over the malty sweetness and works with the hops to create an herbal, spicy concoction that melts over your toungue. Finish is adequately bitter with hints of orange rinds and lingering malty sweetness and the drying effect of alcohol.
Smooth and creamy in the mouth with soft, delicate carbonation in a medium-full body. Simply ripe and lucious in the mouth.
Couldn't ask for much more in terms of a DIPA. Full and malty, good dosage of hops, though I wouldn't mind a bit more. Bottle is slowly enjoyed. Glad I have another waiting for one more encounter before I'm left all alone. 1,382 charactersSkidz, Dec 08, 2004

The aroma starts from the top of the bottle and comes on strong right at the pour all the way to settling, giving forth a pleasant nasal experience that reveals citrus and plums. The taste is absolutely superb, with grapefruit and pine coming to the forefront. It is so well balanced, despite its abundance of hops, that I was taken aback at just how balanced it is. The alcohol in my opinion, is remarkably well hidden. This is a great beer. 516 charactersproc, Nov 18, 2004

Drinkability suffers just a bit from being so strong in flavor and the apparent alcohol. This is a good beer, but I might need a few more to make a real decision on it.
Re-reviewing: The nose is just full of beautiful grapefruit hops, super sweet, and DIVINE. The flavor is so nice, with tons of sweetness from the hop and big caramel malt. Wow. This is what I was missing from the aged version I had. Drinkability also jumps on this one. I definately recommend this beer fresh. So good. So DAMN good. 1,099 characterskmpitz2, Nov 03, 2004
3/5  rDev -31.7%look: 3 | smell: 3 | taste: 3 | feel: 3 |  overall: 3Bottle Conditioned. This is the last beer of a massive evening with Spiesy. We warmed up with some lesser beers before finishing with the two big beers of the night, this and Hop Rod Rye Ale. Sadly not impressed with either. Appearance of this is a slightly cloudy lightish amber with a very slight foam on top, slightly below average. The aroma is of an American Pale Ale - the sticky malt and the orange and grapefruit hinted hops rise in a pleasant, though not astounding manner. Nothing impressive so far. Mouthfeel is tingly and medium bodied - not quite as stickly as expected, though it has a tackiness that clings slightly to the mouth. Acceptable. The alcohol is well used to bring flavour and warmth. Flavour is orange flowers with a smearing of honey. There is a wow! intensity about this, and that seems the biggest asset. Impact. The flavours don't move much from front to finish, though it does linger pleasantly, shifting as it fades in the mouth - but here I am struggling to find good things about this, the 5th best beer in the world. It's nice. It's big. It has impact. It lingers nicely in the mouth. It's really not that great. 1,148 charactersSteveP, Oct 11, 2004

Smell: HOPS! Flowery and citrusy but the hops are jumping out of this glass. Maybe some lemon zest or orange peel would best describe it but it's definitely of the hop nature.
Taste: This is palate blowing goodness! It tastes like a lemon-orange juice combination with a grapefruit background. Very citrusy and a crisp finish. It definitely has a bitter slant to it but it's not done in a harsh way. I'm not sure I have enough taste buds to figure out all that is going on here. There is some pine notes to it as well. Damn, it's good.
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied and oily with a crisp finish.
Drinkability: I certainly can't see making a session out of this one! It's so good though. I have to tell myself to "slow down". This isn't for the faint of heart or the new BA. But it certainly is a fantastic beer to marvel. I can understand why it's No. 1 in the Double IPA category. Beautiful stuff. 1,021 charactersmattcrill, Oct 05, 2004

Dark Orange.
Outlandish, gushing hop aroma of pine, grapefruit, ground up orange peel, orange, lemon and all citrus fruits for that matter combine with biscuity and toffeeish malt that I can simply smell all day.
A gigantic onslaught of hops, along with their bitterness, consume my entire mouth. Raw, villainous, harsh, demonic, unrelenting hops, providing uncut viscious notes of grapefruit, pine, resins and mango. The hops point and laugh at the malt as they pass by my salivary glands. No distinquishable malt flavors but a solid body to say the last and a big, bodacious mouthfeel.
Yummy. 695 charactersCrosling, Sep 23, 2004
5/5  rDev +13.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I would like to thank the great Iowa BA, BuckeyeNation for hooking me up with a bomber of this awesome stuff.
Pours a bright carmel color, crystal clear in transparency. Head is fairly big and very creamy, as it lingers as long as as I have been writing the first portion of this review. Smell is of citrusy hops, floral hops, and a sweet toffee smell. Absolutely perfect for the style. Taste is gigantic. Packed wall to wall with a hop bitterness that is on par with the best American double IPA's (Rogue, for one). I served this only slightly colder than room temperature, because I wanted the full brunt of the hops onslaught. Mouthful is also perfct. Smooth and slick, almost motor oil viscosity. Excellent all around, versus the style. Get it, drink it, love it. 768 charactersTastyTaste, Sep 10, 2004

4.7/5  rDev +7.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5I was lucky to find this 22 oz. bomber...as I've been so excited to try it.
Pours into my glass a very hazy deep orange with a small head. The pour is thick and creamy. The smell is overwhelming to my nose. A cornucopia of hops along with alcohol notes and some spicy citrusy tones. Unlike anything I've smelled before. The first sip is amazing..a great balance of flavors...this brew demands respect. Hops lead the way with some spicy pine tones. The biterness is there but it's balanced well and not at all overwhelming. The alcohol comes through on the back of the palate...you can tell this is a badass Double IPA. Mouthfeel is unlike any other beer I've tried yet...it has a great full body. After trying this I can't wait to try some other 3 Floyd's brews. The only downside I can see for this brew is that one of them will kick my ass...so the drinkability factor is not very high. Otherwise, this is a great beer that I'm glad I've had the opportunity to try.
3-2-2005: New, fresh batch of Dreadnaught awaits me.... pours bright golden orange with a thick dense head. HUGE citric hop nose...grapefruit, orange, lemon...mixed with spiciness, pine sap resin....it times like this that I wonder why 5.5 isn't an option!!! A hophead's dream come true....big citrusy, piney hops meld with a nice caramel malt background. Alcohol weaves in and out and bitterness is nice and strong...yet not too overpowering. Still one of the best double IPA's...period. A nice full, chewy, slightly syrupy mouthfeel bathes the palate in hops...lovely. Drinkability gets a bit of a bump as this fresh batch is just so hoptastic that I don't want the bottle to ever be empty. Yum yum yum!! Three Floyds has impressed me yet again...now just drop the price a bit please!! 1,761 charactersorbitalr0x, Sep 04, 2004

Poured into an imperial pint glass, formed a 1" light beige head over the orangey copper hued brew. Dense, long-lasting head, laces tremendously. Aroma is citrusy hops, with a sweetly malty undercurrent. Taste is, wow, smooth sweet malts upfront, which segues into biting piney and citrusy hops, and a tinge of alcohol as it all leaves the mouth. Mouthfeel is incredibly smooth, excellent for the style and abv. Drinkability is great as well, unfortunately it's not as easily available as it should be around here. 574 charactersppoitras, Sep 02, 2004
5/5  rDev +13.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Pours bright orange with a small, bubbly head.
Tons of hop aroma in the nose. It's like a pine bomb went off in the glass. Lots of bitterness and a little sweetness too.
Full bodied with light carbonation, but smooth and creamy. Absolut hop bomb here. Tons of citrusness that becomes quite bitter and just finishes with a dry bitterness. Sweetness is also quite pronounced as well with some malt backbone. This beer is all about the hops though.
Delicious IIPA, I know all 5's should be rare but this is truly an exceptional beer. Alcohol is very well hidden. Truly a masterpiece. Just wish I'd bought more than one. 625 charactersSouthernbrew, Aug 30, 2004
4/5  rDev -8.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Appearance: Brassy, hazy golden color with a moderately-sized off-white head; lots of broken lace and moderate carbonation.
Aroma: Great clouds of citrus, grapefruit, and pine tar hops assail the olfactory sense. Amazingly, beneath the totality of hops, there is a subdued, by quite discernable sweet malt backbone.
Taste: Begins with a sweet, light caramel malt flavor, which is rapidly subsumed by a massive wave of citrus and pine tar hop. Although faint, the malt flavors are not entirely vanquished, remaining a subtle presence throughout the taste. The finish is quite interesting, there are lingering metallic hop notes and a distinct light honey-like malt sweetness, which played off well against the intense hops.
Mouth feel: Smooth, creamy and quite full.
Drinkabilty/notes: A superb example of the style, not one of my favorites, being that I am not a hophead. Nonetheless, the craftsmanship exhibited by this beer is remarkable. Thanks to HardTarget for sharing this rare beer. 1,001 charactersPegasus, Aug 26, 2004
4.07/5  rDev -7.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4IPA (including Double IPA) is one of my favorite styles, so I opened after much anticipation. Color was orange-copper, and slightly hazy. Aroma was potent, there was no questioning there are plenty of hops in this one. Mouthfeel was chewy and a bit sticky/resiny. 
An excellent beer, but really had more of a barley wine like attitude... the maltiness was a bit too big and the hops while strong didn't quite keep balance with the level of malt. After knowing Alpha King so well I was really I was expecting more from it's big brother. 538 characterstruthbrew, Aug 24, 2004

Decanted into my tulip glass as a deep amber orange liquid with a frothy sticky 2 finger off white cap. Great aroma: musty grapefruit, hint of pine... some malt sweetness...a hop heads dream. Starts big with ample citrus-spruce hops up front and a huge malt body to balance it off... then some salty- soapy tastes where the alcohol tastes mingle with the hops on a creamy delivery... then the finish is long with citrus pine bittering going to more metallic tastes...what a great big APA!

Color was very slightly hazy golden yellow copper color.
It pours with a creamy white head and distinctive crisp hop aroma.
The head dissapates to a thin lace after a few minutes.
The first flavor is sweet malt and hops, and the hops linger on the
back of the tongue for a long time.
This IS the big brother to Alpha King, and is my benchmark for I2PA's.

4.8/5  rDev +9.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5This is packaged in a 22oz bomber on which the label has fell off, brought to me by a friend traveling through Indiana. It has the Three Floyds cap on it but that is the only identifier besides the employees at Kahns swearing that it is Dreadnaught.
My friend said I would know if it was the right beer if I poured it out and it was neon orangehaha, I can see where he gets that from. It pours out with a body that is a definitely a bright orange shade of copper. A big head rolls up, and hangs around stickily rather well for a beer with this ABV. Tiny streams of bubbles roll up through the body and I can see pieces of what appears to be hop matter floating within.
The nose is vivid and thick. I can practically smell the stickiness of the sweet malts. Big, big oily pine presence in the nose as well as citrus rinds, and grapefruit. As soon as I popped the cap and took a whiff I knew I definitely had the right beer.
The flavor here is a very intense experience. The front is sticky and sweet with mega-malts. The middle is taken over with a flat, vibrating bitterness, this transitions into hints of pine-apple, oily pine flavors, hints of apricot, and big citrus rinds and grapefruit flavors. This beer comes close to what I think it would be like to suck on a syrup dipped hop cone, and literally be prepared to pick little pieces of hop matter off your tongue and teeth. Dont taste the alcohol as much as feel it trail warmly into my belly, Mouthfeel is a little sticky, or oily but that just makes the delicious flavor hang around that much longer.
A simply outstanding Double IPA, well crafted and a really intense experience. Again, if only Three Floyds would distribute here I would revisit this one often. I owe the pleasure of experiencing this one to John, thanks man! 1,815 charactersFormatKid, Aug 22, 2004

The color is deep and rich and the head, while not so much big, is thick and foamy. The smell is hoppy and spicy with some chocolate flavors. The taste is very spicy with a thich hoppy taste, with tons of syrupy pine and some good citrius. The mouthfeel is perfect for the beer, and although the beer is hefty with alcohol, you wouldn't necesserily stop while drinking the beer to notice. 493 charactersFranklinPCombs, Aug 12, 2004

Beer pours a nice dark copper with a massive white, fluffy head. Really nice lacing patterns. 
Very strong smelling beer. Lots of citrus/pine aroma. I also get a hard candy type of smell from this beer. Yummy! Background note: I sometimes drive by the Ferra Pan candy factory (home of the atomic fireball!) on my way to & from Chicago. When the factory is producing candy, the aroma is similar to the background aromas I get from this beer. 
Taste is ever so bracing. Lots of pine (think pine sap) and grapefruit. Swirling underneath the obvious hop characteristics is some subtle apple/plum flavor and again, that trace of hard candy. This one also has a slightly sour aspect as you work through the beer. Im guessing that this beer is heavy on the malts, something is in there to keep this baby close to in-balance. Given the obvious heavy hopping, the brewer has made a well balanced beer. 
Mouthfeel is surprisingly creamy. Im not sure why, but I expected a harder edge. Drinkability is good, but for me at least, one per night of this wonderful beer would be enough. Here is a beer that lives up to its well deserved hype & pimping! 1,264 charactersRedrover, Aug 07, 2004
4.63/5  rDev +5.5%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Aroma: Pinesap & Grapefruit infused into a solid malt base. Nice juicy fresh hops busting out of this puppy.
Appearance: A rosy orange body with nice clarity. A white multi-sized bubbled cap gives a classic appearance for the style.
Flavor: Alpha acids personified. A major hop presence, but crisp and refreshing. Refreshing is too mild; exhilarating, motivating, empowering! After sipping this beer, I feared naught. Strong citric acid taste but not a grapefruit taste, more of an orange like citric. With all that acid going on, there was no burn. The flavors jumped but were based on a rock solid malt backbone. Not a hint of alcohol.
Mouthfeel: While the burn wasnt tasted, it was slightly felt (if that makes sense/and I dont really care if it doesnt). Overall a wonderful smooth feel with a medium body.
Overall Impression: Solid craftsmanship allowed me to enjoy the intensely juicy hops without the rough bitter edge. This beer would keep you from getting scurvy, and I found it to be an outstanding double IPA. I could drink this beer all summer, and into fall and not grow tired of it.
Mad props to mattcrill (aka Stoutness) for the opportunity to sample this world class beer. I owe you buddy! 1,215 charactersHardTarget, Aug 01, 2004
4.08/5  rDev -7.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4First off: Big thanks to deejaydan for the chance to sample this.
Pours a cloudy, light orange-amber with a modest 1/4 inch white head.
Nose is mild but very interesting: musky apple, sawgrass, apricot, and pine.
First hit on the palate is filled with an almost delicate bitterness, the musky apple and piney characters from the nose hiding in the background. Midsip balances out very well. The alcohol is evident in the warming aftertaste here.
Mouthfeel is creamy and the carbonation is rather mild overall.
Drinkability is solid, with the only detraction being the evident alcohol feel.
Overall, this oh-so-slightly edges out Smuttynose's Imp IPA as my favorite to date.

4.33/5  rDev -1.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Sampled from a bomber.
This Double IPA poured a hazy, peach-orange color with good, off-white foam that persisted and clung to the glass, leaving some lace and clumps. The smell was fruity hops with a good shot of malt and a touch of oak. The taste was hoppy with some fruitiness and a good malt balance and a hint of oak. The hop bitterness came through in the finish. The mouthfeel was smooth and crisp and dry with medium-full body and moderate carbonation. The finish was very dry and hoppy. This was a very nice double IPA, though I think it is somewhat more fragrant and flavorful on tap. I would rate the drinkability higher, but at 9.5% ABV, it is dangerous to drink too many of these.
Thanks to qarre for this bottle. 732 charactersUncleJimbo, Jul 10, 2004
4.5/5  rDev +2.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Appearance  The bomber poured out a cascade of dark, hazy orange beer. The head built from the bottom. I enjoyed watching it rise through the liquid and open up at the top like a bed of tulips blooming on fast-forwarded film.
Smell  This is classic East Coast beer. The tangy, fruity hop profile is huge, supported generously with some good pine oil. The toasted malt base is loaded with rich caramel and toffee.
Taste  The monster malts come out beautifully at the taste. This beer has a big sweetness to it. Some of this comes from the sugars but I think much of it is from that over-reaching level of IBUs that pushes a hoppy beer into the land of sweets a la DFHs 120 Minute.
Regardless, the key here is balance. Youve got two big 450 lb sumo wrestlers engaged in combat, each unable to unseat the other. The hops and malts come together fearlessly, locked into a perpetual state of immobility. This is a battle royale.
Mouthfeel  This is bigger than medium in the body and incredibly smooth and well-blended. This beer will melt in your mouth.
Drinkability  Amazingly smooth. The ABV is undetectable. This is a winner.
Comments  Huge thanks to garthwaite for sending this one out my way. Ive been dying to try it. 1,254 charactersRoyalT, Jul 04, 2004

Mmmm, thats a hoppy beer! Pours a decent red gold color, with moderate white head. Particles of yeast are apparent in the beer. Smells of hops, naturally. Taste is powerful and bold, reminds me of Hopdevil. Big on the spice, bitter with a slight tang to it, this is a hop lovers beer. Yet this beer still remains drinkable despite its punch. Highly recommended, doubly so if you are addicted to hops. 476 charactersRocketWidget, Jun 28, 2004
4.8/5  rDev +9.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Orange / yellow in color with a one inch head. Some nice lacing developed. The aroma is full of floral hops and a bit of malt. The flavor is huge as kicked up malt levels are matched perfectly with the grassy hop bitterness. Citrus tones (leaning towards orange) and mildly noticeable alcohol round out the taste. 
The mouthfeel was smooth and lightly syrupy. The finish was smooth but with a long riding bitterness that doesn't want to fade. Between a medium and heavy bodied brew. An absolutely exceptional brew that can be quaffed endlessly. 547 charactersGavage, Jun 22, 2004
5/5  rDev +13.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I think what I like most about this beer is its solid nature. It is an all around solid great beer. It is not the most complex, but that works in its favor here. Sometimes, a complex beer loses points in drinkability with me because after one, my palate is tired. Not so with this one.
Dreadnaught is a beer I can enjoy immensely and still want to reach for another.
I bought this in a 22 oz bomber. The label has a crazed British soldier drinking from a metal mug labeled "I.P.A." next to him are two rather weird looking purple skinned people that are supposed to be Indian I think. Who the hell draws this stuff?!?!?
It pours a warm looking hazy golden orange with a chunky head. Lacing on the glass is evident and a paper thin layer of head floats on top of my glass all the way down. 
It smells fruity, but not overpowering. Less fruity than, say, a Stone IPA. Once again, not over the top, but solid. I like that.
The taste is not overwhelming hops. It is hoppy, however. I think they did a great job of integrating the hops and malt. Nice.
Mouthfeel is actually on the creamy side and not harsh. The hops last in my mouth, but are not overpowering. Food goes well with this beer (At least the feta, tomato, and spinach pizza from Trader Joe's goes well).
I wish I had some 12oz. bottles of this so I could have 3 in a night. Very nice job. 1,367 characterssilenius, Jun 19, 2004
3/5  rDev -31.7%look: 3 | smell: 3 | taste: 3 | feel: 3 |  overall: 3Another American IPA beaten to death with hops. I reckon this would be great if they toned the hops down a bit. Massive grapefruit, lychee and pine-citrus (pine-o-clean) flavours. Malts are smooth lightly sweet, but quickly (too quickly) hidden by the fatty hops. Tasted like deepfried hops in the end, little balance. I understand that its not really meant to be elegant or anything, but it could have done with some restraint or something. I don't even think i liked as much as the score i gave it. 500 charactersrastaman, Jun 18, 2004

22oz bomber. The dreadnaught is exactly as the name describes, it is fearless... it makes a beautiful thick opaque copper color followed by a nice just a tad darker than white head and makes a sticky lacing all the way down my glass. Smell is sweet of cereal malts with hints citrus fruit, but this is only a trap. Then the dreadnaught attacks with a hopped flavor like no other! It is a sweet candy coated hop cone in a glass. Full bodied and syrupy, sticky, leaving a thick coating on the mouth and throat. Drinkability? Holy crap, I just died and went to hop heaven. Just plain awesome.
Uncle Jimbo told me that this was better than the big west coast IPAs... hmm, tough call. 723 characterskmcnair, Jun 18, 2004

A graasy, citrusy hop nose highlights the aroma of this beer. A touch of malt balances the hops nicely.
The carmel like sweetness of the malt is finished by a grassy hoppines. This is what an IPA shopuld taste like. This is the most balanced IPA I have ever tried. Neither the hops nor the malt dominate the flavor yet both standout.
This is a nice chewy beer that is not too heavy and is characterized by a slight bitter bite that lasts from beginning to end. This beer is the epitome of what a perfect beer should be.
I loved this beer and cannot wait to try this wonderful tonic again. This beer is what beer is all about. Simplicity, complexity, balance, hydration, contentment. Superb. 858 charactersfilabrazilia, Jun 13, 2004

4.64/5  rDev +5.7%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4This beer impressed me as soon as I began pouring it. It was practically incandescent orange out of the bottle. It struggled to put up just a little bit of white fuzzy head, but couldn't quite achieve much more than a thin layer of fizz that lasted the entire glass. The smell is dominated by citrus and piney hop notes. The taste was simply divine. A bit of caramel malt sweetness lead the way into a citrus and pine hop overload with a dominant tangerine fruitiness. Mouthfeel is very light, carbonationg relatively low. This brew drinks so very easily, but the hops and alcohol would soon put me off to sleep after a few of these. Truly a great relaxing brew. 662 charactersjlervine, Jun 01, 2004

The beer was topped off with an average sized head of creamy foam. The complex aroma is very floral and lively. Piney with touches of freshly mown grass. Fruits like oranges and lemons are strong. The taste is perfectly sweet and full with fruity malts and an estery bitterness. This beer is quite drinkable for being so strong. Also, it isnt as heavy tasting as I thought it would be. There is a sticky sweet orange fruitiness that coats the tongue.
A monster of a beer that, I feel deserves its fine reputation. Beautiful on all counts.

Flavor is sweet on the front palate that gradually slides into a pronounced bitterness. Malt is caramel and some fruity notes. Some buttered bread and a hint of yeast are also evident. Mouthfeel is lightly carbonated but very smooth with an oiliness that glides down your gullet. Any sweetness is tempered with the bittering. The slide is so gradual to be almost unnoticed until the swallow and the back of the tongue and throat get hit with the very pleasant but potent bitterings. It may be that there is enough malt to cut the bitterness to a tolerable level but whatever formula it works perfectly.
Drinkability is amazing, there is no way this can be 9.5 ABV ! I could all day and all night. Every beer lover should get to try this beer. 1,013 charactersCRJMellor, May 26, 2004
4.6/5  rDev +4.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4This is great stuff! I had the Dreadnaught initially a year ago on tap, but recently I managed to get a case of bombers, and let me tell you, I was not disappointed. The bottled Dreadnaught poured a deep, slightly reddish amber with a full, fluffy off-white head. The initial smell is of imposing hops, grapefruit, roses, and sweet pine. The taste is rich and textured: lots of strong hoppiness to be sure, but underneath there's so much going on--bitter candied caramel. The mouthfeel is medium thick, and the alcohol is disguised cleverly, but clearly it is potent. Too bad this stuff is so hard to get your hands on! 619 characterslongpondbeerman, May 25, 2004

4.92/5  rDev +12.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5What a pour!!! Me 12 oz English pint took this roar pour with 2 of sticky tight spumescent beige head over a noticeably clear golden amber & dark sunset orange well carbonated pour. Head retention leaves a huge pillowy coating on me drink.
These IPA scents do not get any better! Heaven! Total rush to the olfactory senses of fresh floral hops. Like an infomercial, "But wait! There's more!" A spectrum of hop bouquet ranging from honey to grapefruit, to a citrus palate of lemons, pinapple and heavy succulent pine resin. Nose is reminiscent of Troegs Nugget Nectar. Pure held in your hand hops scents like Dogfish Head 90 minute.
Intense IPA zesty acidic hops assault the tongue. The IBUs on this able bodied beer must be off the charts into the 100+ range. The cornicopia of flavors starts with sweet grapefruit slices, fresh grass & deep pine resin. There is quite an acidic tongue sizzle. The aftertaste is ephemeral dry hops. Once again, curious to know the hops used in Dreadnaught. 
Last swigs: This is the best IIPA I have come to taste, yet. What a great IIPA! Bottle conditioned too, tastes like this one was brewed as fresh as this morning, but I had this one sitting in my beerfridge for four months. In comparison the STONE Ruination, Id say less mouth sizzle and less of the sweet sugar stick. The first pour didnt have any yeaasties. Second pour was more pure goodness. 
Special kudos to BA brother cerevisiaephilus for this sweet sample. I also just reviewed my BELLS Two Hearted form cere also. Cheers!

Poured dark copper/amber, hazy, some small particles in suspension. Nice,foamy head.
Big hop aroma and plenty 'o malt too. Pine needles and oranges,actually reminded me of a pine tree bough. 
Massive hop attack on the pallet, with malt backbone. A mild astringency in the malt. Huge hop character and alcohol.
Lots of fruit, pine resin,citrus zest, caramel and a light quanine aftertaste. Strong bitterness lingers between sips, as well as the sticky, juicy nectar of the hop. A real treat.
Edit 3/23/06:
A fresh example reveals a juicier, hoppier character.
Smooth bitterness accents large hop oil flavors, and the quanine aftertaste is missing.
The fresher, the better. 717 charactersbrewandbbq, May 15, 2004

A medium-sized, dense, cream-colored head leaves sticky, foam lacing. Hoppy, sweet, creamy nose with a hint of milk chocolate. Wow. Super bitter in the front with some sweetish cream. The middle turns almost chocolatey. It's creamy sweet with a touch of sour milk (not a bad thing here). Very bitter again in the finish. Some crackers and lots of alcohol. Amazingly intense flavor. A slightly odd background effect might be due to the alcohol. It certainly tames with temperature. Bottom line: an outstanding, bitter, creamy, sweet, intense beer. Hoohah!

Big 3 Floyds hop smell. 
The taste is what I'd hoped for. The hops introduce me to the beer. They're so unavoidable as I begin to drink. Then the thickness of the liquid coats my tongue and the sweetness of the malt begins. It's an "all at the same time" beer. Bitterness kicks in almost after the fact.The alcohol presence blends with everything else. ( I may have been drinking big beers too much - not possible- to notice) I'll be drinking this again. I will judge the drinkability after a few but for now it's very drinkable. It's an all by itself beer. No pairing comes to mind. 891 charactersfaernt, May 02, 2004

4.09/5  rDev -6.8%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 3.5Clear dark gold/orange body with a white film. Possibly the best hop aroma I've smelled. They are there, all over the place, the big juicy grapefruity hops, but they're more than that, they're a perfume, they're the pine cardboard you put on the mirror in your car, they're the orange you ate this morning, they're the lemon juice you've put over your salmon yesterday, they're your freshly cut grass on a sunny june day. Hops, all over the place and then some, and a bit of alcohol and some heavy malt. Quite complex adventure. The first sip then adds some, grass, grapefruity, but more than that. There's a mineral saltiness in there, alcohol peaks and thick malt layers, honeyish chewy malt. Texture is smooth, creamy, very thick. Definitely my favorite I2PA and it may even convince me to seek a few others out, but I'm still far from sold to the green side, the hophead clan. Worth another tribute to Raindog for providing me with this modern classic. 956 charactersRastacouere, Apr 19, 2004
4.97/5  rDev +13.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5The beer pours a brilliant orange, almost OSHA safety-like in it's vibrancy. A bit of a chill haze intensifies the glow, with a thick, almost white, well beaded froth settled atop. The head lasts throughout, diminishing into a thick collar surrounding splotchy mist. Plenty of lace clings to the glass, leaving a broken, even, filmy covering. My only complaint at all is the lack of a tight film throughout. With this much hops, I expected incredible head retention.
The aroma rises from the bottle upon uncapping, an almost tangible plume of hop laden fog escapes it's glassy confines. If I had a horse's feed bag filled with freshly picked hops, still wet from the pacific northwestern rain, strapped to my face I don't think it would smell fresher. Hugely earthy, floral, piney, herbal and citric all at once. I can't pick out anything specific, but I'm guessing some new high alpha triploid varieties. The hops undoubtedly dominate, with just enough malt adding an undercurrent of toasty, syrupy sweetness. A touch of biscuit, with restrained esters hinting towards peach and white grape. Stunning.
The flavor start with an almost immediate bitterness. A huge, syrupy malt backbone struggles to support the oily, slick hops that rush in with slavering jaws, bent on defiling your tastebuds. As the palate acclimates itself to the bittering, the malt acquires a creamy, almost buttery texture. This stuff in insanely smooth, the alcohol completely hidden. The hops try vainly to assume some modesty up front, allowing toasty malt and a touch of bready yeast to attempt some diplomacy with your tastebuds. Notes of peach, pear and white grape esters are offered, but a wanton, instinctive urge to conquer wins out. The hops assume full command of the finish, with plenty of shock and awe in the oily, rindy citric bitterness. Herbal, pine and floral hop flavor add a lovely complexity that makes the finish a triumph of the american love for more, more, more. I can't get over how great the hopping is. As powerful as it seems, the malt manages to keep it reasonably in check, impeccably balanced. The aftertaste is all hops, mainly herbal and floral flavors, with a hop bitterness that sticks to the tongue for hours. The only indication of the alcohol is a faint boozey fusel feel when exhaling. Full bodied, with a creamy, buttery feel and firm, delicate carbonation.
I enjoy big beers on an irregular basis, and I believe this is the first that I could easily keep a case on hand for daily consumption. It's so incredibly satisfying and delicious, almost sessionable in it's ease of quaffing. I found myself restraining from gulping down the hoppy goodness. Ye gods, this is a seductively dangerous nectar.
A beer the pacific northwest was created for. A creature both menacing and consoling.

The beer pours a clear copper color with an offwhite fluffy head foaming up pretty easily. The head fades to a surface layer rather quickly. Aroma is all hops, I get a mixture of rich resiny pine scents with some pungent sour grapefruit hits as well. 
First sip reveals a thinner body than expected and slightly oily texture. Low smooth carbonation. The flavor is all hops moves from piney notes to sour citrus notes that leave a bitter flavor on my lips. the overall flavor leaves a bitter impression in my mouth and I also get a slight alcohol warming in my throat and belly. A decent beer, but not worth the hype in my opinon. 749 characterssulldaddy, Apr 13, 2004

Sharp snappy cascade hop presence. Taste is snappy and dominated by grapefruit juice, bitter spruce tips like taste and full on hop snap balanced on a toasty biscuit malt backbone.

Hazy medium amber with a huge frothy head, that died down quickly, but still left a layer on top which left little bit of lacing throughout my glass. Smell is surprisingly rich and creamy, of candied hop pinecones. Taste is also rich and creamy...alcohol is not really detected via taste or aroma, but I can't ignore that warm alcohol feeling in my tummy :-) Mouthfeel is on the full side of medium, very smooth. I know the malt is in there someplace, but the hops are very smooth, and come across as grapefruit and sugar. That flavor lingers, but surprisingly the bitterness is kept to a minimum. I couldn't give it a five for drinkability, as I only had the one bottle. I would love to try this on tap, and then to see how many I could drink...Definitely a very tasty beer. 881 charactersPatandDavid, Apr 11, 2004

Smells hoppy, hoppy, hoppy: three rows deep in the hop section at the brew store. Pine and pepper.
Taste is ... wow-ow-ow, BIG. Hop head's dream. Flowery, peppery, biting hops, exhillarating. How in the world do they do that? It's not bitter, but it's over-the-top hopped. 
Medium bodied, slightly oily mouthfeel.
It's easy to drink, probably would sneak up on you, and would be great with a large variety of food. Too damn bad it's $9 a bottle. 535 charactersbudsboy, Mar 31, 2004
4.15/5  rDev -5.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.5After much searching for a trading partner to get this elusive brew, we finally meet. Thank you AragornUnplugged. The beer leaves the 22 oz. brown bomber (with a really funky label I might add) and finds itself in my imperial pint glass. The appearance is clear orange amber color with a nice white head, both pretty standard for a good IPA. The head leaves a lot quicker than a single IPA which is likely due to the high strength of the brew. Carbonation is also low and is gone rather quickly. The aroma is surprisingly mild for an imperial IPA. It is clearly hoppy, but the aroma does not hit you across the room like a Ruination or a Celebration. There are strong notes of alcohol and caramel malts on the nose as well. The taste is quite sweet with a strong peppery kick due to the hops. Smooth silky mouthfeel with a syrupy thick consistency. Strong alcohol burn detracts somewhat from drinkability. Overall I think this brew is very close to being on the fence to being a barley wine, not that there is anything wrong with that. I will try to eventually get some more to cellar to see if it ages well like a real barley wine. Too bad, it will take a quite a while to get some more in. 1,191 charactersrajendra82, Mar 27, 2004

Very nice to look at, golden, with a good foamy head and lace like curtains. Pretty well carbonated, with tiny bubbles racing eachother up the glass.
Hoppity hop hoppy when you put it to the nose, and flowery too.
Citrus and flowery with some serious hop, followed by more hops with a hoppy aftertaste.
Sticky in the mouth, which adds to the pucker factor with brings down the drinkability somewhat. Kind of over the top, but good. I wonder if giving one a few months to simmer would bring the beer a little more balance and make it a bit smoother to drink. 734 charactershustlemuscle, Mar 22, 2004
4.77/5  rDev +8.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Largely clear, coppery-bronze in hue, the white head reached about a finger in height before dissipating to soapy foam. The subsequent lacing was very minimal. Honestly it looks like a typical IPA. Then I took a sniff. Its not normal! A violent assault of hops assails my nose, grapefruit rinds, grapefruit flesh, a forest of pine trees and a wild flower potpourri. The potent aromas are big, bold, and juicy. It is oh so inviting, my mouth is watering. Let me start the description of the taste this way, after about two sips I had hop burps. Sometimes when I quaff a Double IPA the gross trusting of hops down the gullet gets tiresome and sometimes I really yearn for a little balance. But Three Floyds has proven an IPA can be produced that is massively hoppy and unforgiving in its lack of balanced. Yet it is graceful and soothing but it also manages to be threatening as well. I am impressed. The hops are so juicy, so oily, so fleshy, so bitter, and so tasty! The hops stick to my lips. The malt influences are minimal and damn near pointless in mentioning, maybe, I mean maybe I could detect a trace of malty sweetness in the form of caramel. At this point I dont care, the hops have captured my attention, I am hooked. The alcohol provides some noticeable warmth. I could jibber-jabber about how great this tastes all night long, so Ill move on. Medium-full in body, very syrupy, the carbonation is very modest but it seems appropriate for the hugeness of this beer. If drinkability is a question of do I want another? The answer is an overwhelming YES!! This IS the best tasting IPA I have ever had. It is great; it is wonderful it is near perfect on the tongue. Thank you so much PhantomVodoo! 1,716 charactersbditty187, Mar 15, 2004

Pours a cloudy mixture of amber and orange. The nose to this beast is unlike anything I've smelled to date. Citrus and hops grab you by the nose hairs and never let go. The first sip is like a thousand little hops jumping up and down on the tongue in a dance to please the beer gods. Oily slick as the dance is finished with a slight malt after taste. Finishing this is down right depressing because the flavor never disappoints and always leaves the mouth wanting more. 557 charactersAhhdball, Mar 13, 2004

Pours a pretty, cloudy orange-brown color with a bubbly white head that continues to leave plenty of lace on my glass as I drink. The scent is unbelieveable - pure hops is what comes to mind. I know that makes no sense, but this is hops in all its hop glory. Even before tasting, I wonder if I'm going to dream about this beer.
The taste? Wow. It's like wave upon wave upon wave of hops - each slightly different. There are citrusey, piney, bitter, dry and maybe even other all slightly different yet still wonderful hop flavors. I don't know if this beer was brewed up with any malt/grain, for all I taste is hops. Maybe this is hop oil? Hop extract? Hop juice? Hop puree? In any case, the beer is incredibly oily, rich and thick.
Hoppy beers are supposed to make you hungry, and about 1/3 of the way thru this I had an incredibly strong desire for spicy wings (that I did not get). The only (possible) downside with Dreadnaught is ... its hoppyness. It's certainly only a sipping beer for beer, though of course this isn't necessarily a bad thing. You don't taste the alcohol - all you get is hop heaven. 1,148 charactersjahred, Mar 12, 2004

After reading many of the reviews on BA i was a bit intimidated when opening my first bottle of dreadnaught. As I poured it into my glass my intimidation grew. The monsterous smell of hops nearly filled my college apartment's kitchen. As I held the beer up to a light it left a beautiful clear amber/golden hue. I put this beer up to my mouth expecting a bitterness not to be described put i was pleasantly surprised. I will not lie, this is a hop monster but it is also incredibly balanced. A nice malt backbone supported the hops wonderfully. The mouthfeel is extremely smooth but leaves a bit a oily hop resin on the tongue. This is one of my favorite beers. Hopefully sometime Nick Floyd will see fit to lower prices on this bad boy. A definate must try. 810 characterssoper2000, Mar 02, 2004
4.67/5  rDev +6.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Hazy, rich orange-amber; more the former than the latter. The head is dark cream to very light tan, is large to start, eventually falls to a thin disk and leaves a decent amount of lace in fat rings and sheets.
Sweet Mother of Hops, this big DIPA smells incredible! It has one of the most intoxicating noses that I've ever had the pleasure to sniff. Needless to say, American hops are front, back, center, top and bottom. The beer smells floral, grapefruity, lemony and piney.
The flavor mirrors the aroma, which is a very good thing indeed. A tidal wave of resinous hops hits the palate with force and is sustained for the life of the mouthful... and beyond. The bittering is definitely there, but Dreadnaught (as is the case with all hoptastic beer) is more about hop flavor than about bitterness per se. Hopheads should do whatever it takes to acquire as much of this stuff as possible.
The body/mouthfeel is simply amazing. This is the thickest, heaviest, chewiest non-stout that has ever entered my mouth. Unfortunately, alcohol isn't as well-hidden as it could be. This would be slightly better beer at about 8.0%. Drinkability takes a small hit since no one will be pounding this bad boy.
Obtaining Dreadnaught was an obsession for me. Finally... finally... I was able to lay my hands on four bombers. I live about 5 hours from the brewery in Munster and am giving serious thought to spending a day resupplying when my stash runs out. The following is a paean to hops that I wrote in anticipation of this review, which is the one that earns me my BA mug.
"Ode to Hops" (with apologies to John Keats)
O leafy shape! bitter attitude! I'll leave
No Stone unturned in quest of beer
That wears its hop-like heart on sleeve,
Tho my Ruination may be near.
Bursting nose of pungent flower, citrus peel, 
With bittered brightness like the sun;
We drink and swoon, my God! we feel
The power of the Dreadnaught's guns,
A Wallop to the Heart of Man.

Smell is hoppy to the nose yet sweet and malty with some fruitiness.
Tastes are well balanced with and explosion of hops but with a citric sweet balance and hint of buttery caramel and alcohol warmth. The hops carry through to the lengthy floral-hoppy aftertaste.
Mouthfeel was good with finer carbonation and silky creaminess.
A bit too rich and high in alcohol to be a drinkable session beer. But hey, that comes with the style.

This a orange-amber color with a little lingering head and decent lacing. The smell is very aromatic with strong floral hops that are extremely pleasing to the nose. The taste is nothing short of spectacular. The hops just bombard your tastebuds. There is a sweetness to this brew and a mellow smoothness that finish it off. There is a silky charachter to this beer that works well with the hops and soothes your throat. The aftertaste is a delightful flavor of hops that lingers until you give in and take another sip. 
I was blown away with this beer and never would guess that it has a high alcohol content. This is a must try for any hophead. 733 charactersstewart124, Feb 11, 2004

Appearance is a nice ambery pale color perfect for an IPA. There was a nice thin head that didn't fade.
Smell is wonderfully aromatic. Its has a very hoppy nose but not to the point of being hard to drink from the smell. Great floral tones and a nice malty backing.
The taste big and flavorful. There is a great balance of bitterness, sweetness, and alcohol. Though it is almost 10% ABV I would have never noticed because the malty body covers it up so well. It is slightly fruity and sweet but finishes nice with a good level of bitterness
Overall - One of the best IPAs I have every had and can not wait to get my hands on some more (whenever that is) 812 charactersElemental, Jan 30, 2004
4.1/5  rDev -6.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Huge Cascadey nose dry-hopped to infinity cut by a raw hop palette. Fruity and well-balanced with bitterness. It could induce a tear or two, but the perceived sweetness, actually the intense floral and fruit character of the hop, does well to balance the bitterness. Hm . . . late-addition hops balancing early-boil hops. 
The latent hop notes just get greener and greener, best described by my boss as "Jerry Garcia's sock drawer." And, as he noted, Avery IPA might be thought of as a mini-Dreadnaught for those looking to avoid the 7 dollar tab. 
Dreadnaught is evocative in taste and smell, but never evolving, never classic.
My only complaint is that this brew, for all its might, still manages to wash out. A touch more body would be in order; that said, the maltiness is more than appropriate and the wee bit of residual sugar is just what this beer needed to make it so surprisingly palateable. 
Virtually the same beer on-tap and in the bottle. Fresh, lively, immortal.

4.9/5  rDev +11.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Review #1 - hope I don't blow this...
Sampled from 22 oz. bottle given as a gift from BA hexjones.
Appearance
Pours a surprisingly clear, rusty orangy color, with only the tracest amount of haze. The head was pillowy, but not sticky, and dissipated to a nice level of foam.
Smell
Woa! Think floral, like swimming in a pool of sweet smelling, floral hops. There may have been othere smells present, but my simple nose was overwhelmed and lost in the glorious scent!
Taste
After the briefest moment of dread - did I die? Is this Heaven? - I realized I had just had a sip of the most amazing beer. The presence of delightful hops was still evident, but noticed a sweet, smooth maltiness as well. Eventually I thought I tasted some citrus notes, but the incredible balance between the floral boquet and sweet malt was so...magical...that I could barely comprehend the bliss all my tastebuds were luxuriating in.
Mouthfeel
Huge and tasty, but so perfectly balanced that you hardly even notice the 9.5% alcohol. Wow!
Drinkability
Much as I'd love to drink a case of this stuff in one sitting, I doubt drinking more than a bomber or two in one sitting is possible because of the workout this beer gives each and every one of your senses. But though I can't see this as a session beer, it's as close to one a 9.5% beer can get.
Overall
Wow! I could think of a myriad of words to describe this most amazing of beers, but the two that come to the forefront are "MUST TRY". Do what you can to get ahold of this beer because it's the kind of beer you'll always remember. 1,585 charactersweefisheads, Jan 23, 2004
4.53/5  rDev +3.2%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Presentation: A 22oz classic Bomber that has a label like that of the BA Database, but with a black background as opposed to the white one shown. No freshness date or strength listed. The label is colorful and attracts closer attention whilst drinking the contents.
Appearance: A hazy dark orange-golden body. An imperious off-white cream colored head forms and looks superb. Smooth looking bubbles form a vivacious looking and long lasting rocky head. Rings of thick vanilla lacing cling to the glass sides, which are not even removed when the beer is swirled.
Nose: Fruity hops, luscious pine needle, coniferous aromas, bitter twangs and some grapefruit, lemon and orange citric laden hops. As it warms it develops a distilled pine needle tar like oily back end that is powerful and all inviting. A quite amazing nose overall.
Taste: Just as the nose, but moreso. It pulls no punches, but never shoots you in the back. The thick viscous hop-oil resin in the latter third is smooth and supremely powerful as it shocks when first tasted, yet entices the imbiber back to replenish the bringer of the long lingering bitterness that coats the tongue and cheeks with an all embracing hop coating that fights dilution from saliva. 
Mouthfeel: Big and bold, but never so much so as to quell the beers Drinkability. Incredibly forthright, confident and quite rightly so, this is a class act.
Drinkability: Tapped like an inverted bottle of Ketchup, all 22 ounces, to the very last drop of beer, and last bit of froth, was extracted into my Glass. If my tongue was long and thin enough, I would have licked the Bottle out as well.
Overall: Excellent, one of the better all round Imperial I.P.A.s that synergises, Appearance, Nose, Taste, Mouthfeel and Drinkability almost to perfection. One of the best Imperial I.P.A.s that I have had to date, itll take some beating. 
This one came into my possession from Cretemixers custom cooled beer bag before we headed out to the Anam Cara on the Friday Night before Extreme. A Seriously Big BA Thanks to Dale for this Beauty  its one that I have wanted to try for a very long time. 2,150 charactersTheLongBeachBum, Jan 20, 2004
4.72/5  rDev +7.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Finally, the keystone in my beer search has been cast in place: Three Floyd's oft-rumored, rarely-delivered Dreadnaught IPA. $4.99 for a 22-ounce bomber. The lack of pertinent information on the bottle intrigues you that much more.
This beer pours out an eery, shiny, not of this world yellow-bronze. There are hints of red at lower, less direct light. A beautifully pure 1/2 inch head appears and recesses to about 1/4th of an inch. This head will leave a trail all the way down the glass, indicating your rate of progress through this mega-IPA.
There is a crazy spice rich hop nose to Dreadnaught, but one would surmise this from its reputation. People will ask what you are drinking from far away just because of the odor. My fiancee claimed to notice a sligtly ampit scent on the nose! You can almost smell the alcohol on this one, but it is quickly cloaked by malt.
I was absolutely shocked by this one on the first taste. Even though it was what I expected, there is no way to be prepared. Be prepared for a hop overdose. The major bitterness of this beer makes identifying individual flavors difficult - and don't expect to gauge any flavor from anything after this.
I catch hints of iced-tea, lawn clippings, grapefruit, and just a few hops. This beer doesn't have an even, mellow hop flavor like most dry-hopped ales. It is freaking enormously hoppy - almost to the point where if you aren't the hophead of your domain, you'll slink away in fright.
I don't find this as well-balanced as Alpha King, but why should it be? There is also a slightly annoying gumball sweetness down in there somewhere, but overall the malts try hard to back up the skyscraping hops. You'll also notice the acidic quality of the hops sinking deeply into the recesses of your palate. 
The hop burp here is a hophead's wet dream. Must be experienced to be fathomed. The mouthfeel isn't at all chewy like some big beers, but it has a nice hop-milkshake presence in your mouth. 
The drinkability is a tough point: it is tasty and enjoyable, but I couldn't drink two bombers. The mega-bitterness will hamper even the most IPA sessioner. Do what you have to: get your hands on this one. 2,188 charactersGreenWBush, Jan 20, 2004
4.87/5  rDev +10.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Grats to weefishheads for this. Thin blanched white topped the yellow to red and impossibly transparent ale. Slight trails of lace etched the path of the beers disappearance. 
The aroma was utterly unique and absolutely heavenly. Gracefully floral without a trace of grassy or resiny smells. Each hop must have been hand selected and blessed before being added.
The taste was subdued sweet malts and blooming hops. Every flavor was delicate and balanced. The taste was almost a sign of brewing perfection - each ingredient added in just the right amount. The ale was sweet on the tongue, clean in its presentation, and left a nice crispness at the end. Only now did I learn that its considered an imperial. Nothing stands out as being doubled, except maybe consideration. 777 charactersfreed, Jan 19, 2004
4.64/5  rDev +5.7%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Sampled at weefishheads' Beer Night--Jan 17th, 2004. Color was a clear light orange, with a low fine white head that quickly disappeared...ordinary. Far from ordinary were the energetic aromas wafting from my glass...lush peachy malts were followed by a blissful bouquet of fresh floral hop notes without the resin spectrum. Taste...just as I suspected, a masterful piece of work, sure to earn the love of any imperial IPA fan. A zingy citric malt backbone with notes of honey and dried fruit sweetness was rounded out with an exceptional herbal bitter finish...which lingered on long after a sip was taken. A fantastically melded collection of flavors and hoppy bitterness. The alcohol was well integrated and remained well-hidden. The beer felt smooth and full, with a good level of carbonation..all in all quite satisfying. I imagine I could drink a 22 oz bomber of this at least. Very good drinkabilty for a style that can at times be a tad over the top or overly sweet. Dreadnaught is simply one of the best brews out there. Huge thanks to weefishheads for putting this one up for tasting! 1,094 charactersHiroProtagonist, Jan 18, 2004
4.7/5  rDev +7.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.522oz. Bomber Bottle: My first one from the Floyds. The beer pours a slightly orangish-amber color. It is a bit hazy. There was some head to it, with a bit of lacing. The aroma is killer: Hops, hops, hops. You could even get a good whiff of them just from the open bottle. Some pine and grapefruit notes to the aroma. The taste is ful of hops, but the balance is superb: they don't overwhelm you like Stone can. There is even a hint of sweetness to the beer. 457 charactersBoto, Jan 17, 2004
4.6/5  rDev +4.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Glowing orange with some haze. Fiery appearance. Nice, lightly whipped ivory white topping. Retention is very good. Nose is filled with orange rind, grapefruit rind, raw hop resin, pine and sweet caramel malt underlying it all. The taste is fantastic. This is some great hop juice. Pure humulus bliss. The rind characteristics are pretty hefty and nice. There's a sweet orange marmalade characteristic that adds depth. Hops also impart pine resin, pungency, tropical fruit tones and a sturdy bitterness. Just the slightest sting of alcohol surfaces every now and then. Body is about medium-full and the carbonation is just light enough to lend a creaminess and drinkability to this one. Even though there's a bit of an edge to this beer, it's quite drinkable.
Thanks cretemixer. 781 charactersBighuge, Jan 17, 2004
4.77/5  rDev +8.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5The beer poured deep golden amber with just an ever so slight haze. The head was large and in charge and overflowed the glass forcing me to lick the counter. The head was off-white and very lasting.
The aroma was malty and citrusy hops. Very floral and quite inviting. The malty aromas in the background are complex and well executed.
The flavor was great straight off the counter. The flavor upon drinking from the glass was malty and citrusy. The bittering hops are well done as are the flavor hops. All the flavors meld in a complex blend of maltiness and hops.
The finish is malty and well bittered and the aftertaste goes to malty bitterness as well and dries out over a long extended period of time. The body is medium-full and very creamy. The drinkability is excellent since there is only a hint of alcohol warming despite the higher alcohol content.
A complex excellent Imperial IPA!

4.57/5  rDev +4.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5This beer deserves all of the praise it has gotten. Pours a bright and clear orange-amber color with a medium thin and frothy off-white head. Thin and quick lacing. Heady aroma of flowery hops (duh) along with some citrus. Rich and smooth with a great hops kick that never becomes overpowering. There is enough of an undercurrent of malt to make this easily drinkable despite the abundance of hops, and that is exactly the right idea. The finish is crisp and has long, lingering hops with some spice. They don't get much better than this. 538 charactersDogbrick, Jan 09, 2004

The taste has some great bitter hop flavors...finishes bitter...sweet malt is a secondary characteristic but evident..excellent firm body..relatively charged up..
This is a big time Imperial IPA...the nose is fantastic...surprisingly the taste dos not mimick the nose as much....from the nose I expected a sweeter flavor...instead this is very pleseantly bitter..sure there is a nice malt backbone that provides some sticky underlying sweetness, but all that does is provide a fantastic complement to this bigass hop load...a piney hop bitterness..definitely more of a sipper but this does not cross into barley wine territory like some do....An excellent Double IPA I'd love to try again... 832 charactersZAP, Jan 08, 2004
4.01/5  rDev -8.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Nicely put together IPA in the over-hopped American style. Big malt base overshadowed by citrus hops that go over the top, but pleasantly.
The hazy amber body is topped by a nice head of off-white foam that retains a bit and laces quite lazily. The taste is citrus hops top to bottom - not at all subtle. The malt barely intrudes upon the dance here and is nearly not a factor.
The nose is very light and virtually not a factor; surprisingly for a beer of this hop level, although caramel does rise as the brew warms. Good mouthfeel from the medium body. Limited drinkability because of the ABV and overhopping. 617 charactersAtLagerHeads, Jan 07, 2004
3.48/5  rDev -20.7%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 2Typical look: reddish amber liquid with perfunctory mousse.
It smells like Pine Sol and nail polish remover. Sticky pine resins boiling over a pitch fire complemented by a meal of resin-dipped grapefruit peel. All of this hemp-sugar is caramelized mind you. It's not fresh pine and citrus so much as baked, candied oils that greet the nose.
Big, explosive flavors of polished herb, pine lumber and citrus seed decorate a voluptuous base of smoky toffee syrup.
I suppose this represents some high-level of acheivement for hop head-bangers, but really... is there nothing to be said for integration and subtlety? If this beer were a person it would be that super loud, bragging, insecure type that you can't wait to get rid of. 
This is chatter, not Beer. 761 charactersputnam, Jan 06, 2004
4.65/5  rDev +5.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Woah! Huge beer. Nice. This beer reeks of hops, in a very good way. Smells like big ole football sized hop cones scented like flowers, nondescript citrus fruit, and evergreens. Malt comes across as juicy, a little estery, and creamy milk chocolate. Each sip is an obscene mouthful of floral, resiny, juicy hops that reminds me of strawberries. Once the mouth becomes acclimated to the onslaught, the soft pale malt with caramel notes comes through, but before that its nonstop celery-tasting bitterness.
It could have used a bit more malt body, but in any case this was a real gem. 588 charactersyen157, Jan 05, 2004
3.9/5  rDev -11.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Beer number 700 on my personal list, so I picked something special. No question, this beer goes for the big hops brass ring. Aroma is a massive smack in the face of hops. This beer is all about the hops, everything else is secondary. Seemed longer on bittering than aromatic hops, even though I let the beer warm a bit for maximum effect. Some rubbing alcohol notes were disconcerting, but these might mellow out if the beer aged a bit. 
A mighty effort in the IPA class. I have to say, I prefer some other brewers' efforts (Stone Ruination, Rogue I2PA, Dogfish Head), but for the hophead, this is quite a fix. 613 charactersBrent, Dec 28, 2003
4.82/5  rDev +9.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Sampled from a 22oz bottle. Tons of information, including directions to the brewery, but I couldn't find a date and considering it is bottle conditioned, I would think that info would be very useful.
Appearance: Deep copper color with a big, frothy head that left ribbons of lacing circling the glass. They are very hard to see because copper color is so deep, but there are tiny streams of bubbles rising in the center of the glass.
Smell: One word, heaven. Aromas of lavender, honey, floral hops, malt, wild flowers, clove, and so much more I couldn't identify. Simply intoxicating.
Taste: Surprisingly malty with fantastically smooth hops. Sweet candied malt and bitter hops. My wife, who does not like hoppy beer said it was great, but still a little to hoppy for her. I found it simply wonderful. The most incredible balance of malt and hops I've ever had. Fantastic.
Mouthfeel: A little to sticky, that was the only flaw I could find.
Drinkability: Um...10, 20 wait it only goes to 5, so 5+. If you haven't had it, what are you waiting for. Drive, trade, threaten what ever you have to do to get this beer, do it! 1,135 charactersLoki, Dec 25, 2003
4.42/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Made the mistake of reading a bunch of reviews before drinking this one down, so it had a lot of hype to live up to right out of the bottle. Needless to say, it met my heightened expectations.
Great color, a nice hue of bronze-orange. Little head, poured into a nice chalice from a local brew-bup. (Don't have any Three-Floyds glassware!). Smell promises something unusual - no overpowering notes of alcohol, just a radient bouquet of sweet, sweeet hops.
Taste - very complex. It took several sips to even begin to appreciate the full body of this brew. Full of presence. Several distinct hop-flavors hit you all at once, then slowly blend into a single intoxicating note. Very easy to drink this one down; I could finish off several of these in an evening, if it wasn't so precious and rare a commodity.
A worthy beer to keep stored away for a special occasion! 871 characterssideshowrob, Dec 22, 2003
4.77/5  rDev +8.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5A sweet and yet bitter slap upside yo' head. Slightly metallic tang. More, I could not say besides to echo what I had written about the draft version because, you see, I was at Nick Floyd's unveiling of his Alpha Klaus at the Map Room, and some other guy, a friend of one of the brewers, insisted we should also try the Dreadnaught. So he bought my buddy and me each a bomber bottle out of the blue. And even though we had been sampling Belgians before, this was the brew that actually got us S***-faced. 504 charactersDrunkMcDermott, Dec 15, 2003
4.52/5  rDev +3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Turbid light bronze hue. Stiff, dense, persistent one fingered head leaves frothy lace. The aroma is dominated by a vibrant, fruit driven melange of ripe melon, sweet clementine, lemon zest and juicy, slightly acidic pineapple notes. Mild ethanol heat, yeast derived bready tones and simple caramel malt surfaces as the volatile hop oils dissipate. Bright, well rounded and appetizing aromawise. Orange flesh sweetness incipient in flavor is quickly complemented by a combination of bittersweet lemon marmalade and sharp, sappy notes of crushed pine needle. Fruit character is dynamic, beginning with a citric acidity then becoming akin to ripe peach mid palate, before stabilizing as a static, sugary honeydew presence. Malt character is underwhelming, but subtle biscuit tones and light toffee provide ample foundation for the assertive hop profile. Moderate in body, with a firmly dextrinous, slightly syrupy mouthfeel. Finishes with a light, but transient surge of residual sweetness, which lends a lingering impression of hopped orange candy. Ethanol warmth surfaces slowly from the esophagus, reminding the palate that this isn't your everyday IPA. Dreadnaught is a rich, superlatively hopped brew. Assertive hop bitterness and vibrant hop flavor ride parallel, and neither becomes obtrusive. With a more pronounced and distinct malt profile this would be untouchable. Superb overall, and unparalled in drinkability. 1,422 charactersmarc77, Dec 15, 2003
4.89/5  rDev +11.4%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 522 oz. bomber served at cellar temp in a Brewer's Art chalice (had to baptize it with something worthy). 
Appearance: Hazy ruddy orange topped by a smallish offwhite head that quickly recedes to an omnipresent film and a ring. Wee splotches of foam are left on the glass. I was expecting a bit more lacing but given the ABV, I shouldn't be surprised at the lack. It might be the glass. I'll try one of my other bottles (the sacrifices I make) on a different glass and see if there's any difference.
Smell: Intense hop aromas.. duh. Grapefruity citrus, orange sweetness, sprucy pine, earthy peppers comprise a wunnerful display of the ambrosial joys that hops impart. I just might be slowly converting to hophead status, but the maltmonster in me was overjoyed to catch some nutty toffee aromas underneath all this wacky crazy hoppiness. By no means is this unrefined, it's just plain heavenly.
Smell: I wanted to go on more about this, but I can't say anymore, so, I move on to:
Taste: Before I describe the taste, let me just say: Hop burps aplenty. I've seen this phrase used in other reviews before, and have experienced it here and there, but I feel I must truly make note of it with this beer. Now, onto the taste. Initially very sweet and brashly hoppy like an unripe barleywine. Then you really taste the hops. First, your palate is assualted, juggernaut-style, by peppery hops. The decimated corpse is then stomped on by some bitter Cascade flavors. Citric fruits then have their way with you and earthy herbal flavors grow on your grave. When warmed, all these flavors come at you at once.
Mouthfeel: Thick and chewy with an everlasting aftertaste. Humulus aeterna, if you will.
Drinkability: An incredibly fine IIPA. Much better than Rogue's interpretation of this burgeoning style. Rogue relied a bit too much on one hop variety, I should think. Very close to an Americanized barleywine at times, this is some stellar beer. I can't wait to try Dark Lord and others from this fine brewery. 2,017 charactersManekiNeko, Dec 12, 2003
4.64/5  rDev +5.7%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 3.5Well, here I go with the Dreadnaught. I've not read any reviews yet, so this'll be fairly impartial. I first cracked it open and a whiff of hops hit me from an arm's length. Wow. Very aromatic hops in this one, I like that. Pour is cloudy orange-brown, not much head (but I don't care!). This beer smells fantastic. First taste: damn. That's some good stuff. Good heavy malt characteristic, which I think most IPA's don't have. Hops are dominant though, and it's a nice blend - whatever blend that may be, I'm not that good yet.
This is a wonderful brew. If you can, you should go out and get 3 bottles today. Drink one now, save the rest for this nasty winter that's heading our way.
For those of you who are interested: a dreadnought is a heavily armed battleship whose main guns are all of the same caliber. Seems appropriate as a 22 ouncer of this is starting to knock me out of the water (hence the low drinkability grade.)

Hazy amber colored beer with a moderate amount of bubbles floating to the surface. It has a sweet citrus aroma that is nice and strong. Mildly sweet flavor kind of like a cross between citrusy hops and butterscotch. The aftertaste is barely bitter and the body is solid without being too thick. The only hint of alcohol is the warm feeling it leaves in your stomach. I really like this IIPA, but Wailing Wench shares many characteristics and is way cheaper. 512 charactersHappyHourHero, Dec 11, 2003

Hoppy grapefruit, pine, and corn sugar nose. Peachy orange fruit highlights. Complex in that how-many-aromas-can-you-pluck-out-of-this-hop-combo-? sort of way. Like chewing on a carnation and quickly chasing it with a wild combo of grapefruit, rind, and a pure, leafy hop plant. Truly an epic, full body on this brew. Not something I could drink every day -- a 9.5% brew with tongue-numbing hops and a body so thick it might be a stew? -- but well worth the sample. 593 charactersmarburg, Dec 10, 2003

Golden and hazy.
Aroma is (underlined) startling! The hops in the aroma are not about bittering. They are a grassy brawn to offset a definite apricot (?!?!) note. And that's just the aroma.
Sharp tang! in the mouthfeel. Flavor has an outstanding range of 1. stinging bitter hop 2. grassy leafy hop 3. juicy fruity hop... all in service of the honey/syrup heavy, solid malt center.
As crazy as the label suggests. "Massive." Uh huh. 516 charactersecoboy, Dec 06, 2003
4.73/5  rDev +7.7%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Hazy orange amber color, topped by a thick, creamy head. A perfect looking beer. Sweet floral aromas waft up from a distance, while up close it's a bit more spicy with some distinct citrus. The taste is pretty freaking amazing, with sweetness, floral notes, bitterness, malt, hops, and citrus all intermingled. Each takes a turn at the front of the stage, then slips in to play a supporting role for the next star flavor. Mouthfeel is also very well done, being at once light but yet solid. However, the carbonation expands just a bit too vigorously (a nit-pick, yes). But this beer goes down very well. I said to myself, I thought this was a double IPA? Then I check the ABV. The alcohol is well disguised in this beer. I can feel a bit of warming in the pit of my stomach after a while, but nothing like many beers in this range. This is really a nice brew. 859 charactersaaronh, Nov 24, 2003
4.94/5  rDev +12.5%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Pours a fuzzy orange color that was hard to pin down, with a nice thin-foam head, with impressive slick lacing in tendril form.
Smells like heaven. Huge grapefruit scents with brisk but burly accents of pine surrounding it. Has a big sweet malt body that makes the hops so sweet and full, but the big hops give it a perfume-like depth and complexity. Amazing, inviting, and made me dizzy with pleasure over and over again, slowly savoring the 22 oz. bottle.
Taste is an amazing balacing act of big malts and bigger hops. The malts are caramelly, but steadily of an amber sort, and help impart a soft and luxurious mouthfeel. The hops are wonderful grapefruit flavored further perked up and sweetened by the malt, with other hop accents including lemon, lime, and a bitterness that pleasantly pricks my tongue with the highest quality alpha feels and flavor. A confluence of all things large and wonderful that a brewer could put in an IPA, yet still sooo drinkable. Makes me wanna say "good Lord!"
Imperial in strength in size but still an IPA in style, this beer continues to throw me for a loop. Every time I open a bottle my eyes roll back into my head, as I drift into an ethereal world of supreme beer experience. 1,227 charactersnomad, Nov 22, 2003
4.32/5  rDev -1.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4I picked up a few bottles of the Dreadnaught at Kahn's in Indianapolis last week while I was on a business trip and sampled the first tonight. I believe I paid $5.50 each for the bottles. The Dread poured into the glass somewhere between polished bronze and light copper color, topped with a light tan head that slowly faded away. Aroma is very grapefruit hoppy, also sweet and a bit alcoholic. Medium to slightly heavy body. Taste is bursting with fresh hop flavor at first, then bittering a bit and tranitioning into a malty sweetness and finishing a bit tart and sharply hoppy again. Definitely some significant alcohol warmth on the way down, a good beer for a cold day but well drinkable any day. 701 charactersmikeys01, Nov 17, 2003
4.75/5  rDev +8.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Pours with a deep cream colored head, very sticky and long-lived. Gorgeous deep bronze colored liquid, slightly hazed. Loads of bready maltiness in the nose with floral, herbal hoppiness coming in behind that. The taste is a substantial malty backdrop...doughy and sweet that's shoved aside by assertive, but not overpowering hoppiness, quite bitter without dominating the palate. Subtle alcohol notes are tasted mid-line. Finishes wonderfully between sweet malt and bitter hops, very hearty and flavorful...why isn't this availiable near me???

Tons of grapefruit. Tons of hops. Tons of alcohol -- and it tastes boozy, too. 
The one thing I might add is that it has the treacly taste of excessive alcohol. Yes, it has tons of hops. But, unlike other great hoppy beers, the hops don't quite mask the thick, syrupy alcohol flavor which lingers like a sweet whiskey. 401 charactersCSimon, Nov 12, 2003
4.58/5  rDev +4.3%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 505/15/04 Re-review: I had to walk thru an update to Dreadnaught after it won my double IPA blind tasting over the likes of Ruination, 90 Minute, Yulesmith, and Hop Wallop. The biggest thing I picked out this time 'round was the aroma and flavor of oak. Everything about Dreadnaught is huge and it all melds together seemlessly for a simply glorious beer drinking experience. Absolutely first-rate! 
First bottle I saw when hitting the beer section at Kahns in Indianapolis was a single, last, lonely bomber of Dreadnaught. Now, Im not a big fan of IPAs but I threw myself at that bottle like it was a life ring thrown to a drowning man.
Dreadnaught came steaming out of its anchorage, a 22oz. bomber, going full steam ahead. Linking up with my pint glass, this dark golden brew waited, sending streams of bubbles up to a solid 1 white head that left a wake of sheet lace on the glass. As I brought the glass to my nose, Dreadnaught fired its first salvo, a broadside of grapefruit aroma with hints of caramel malt and alcohol that had me thinking I was getting a glass of alcohol-laced grapefruit juice. As I took one, then two, sips, Dreadnaught opened up with all guns firing  hops, hops, hops!! Shot through by a massive barrage of grapefruit and some pine flavors, I continued to drink as any hints of malty goodness were ruthlessly dispatched by the constant assault of bitter hops and alcohol. The feel was somewhat heavy and a bit raw.
I continued through the first glass and finished off the bottle as my head started getting a bit fuzzy. Dreadnaught had accomplished its mission: set forth and obliterate any and all references to malt. On the whole, Dreadnaught is one top-notch IPA. Drinkability suffers a bit because, as you enjoy the all-guns-firing hops frenzy, the potent alcohol content comes out of nowhere like a torpedo to sink you. Nevertheless, hopheads rejoice! Your nectar is served. Be warned, all others: if you hate grapefruit, give Dreadnaught a wide, wide berth. 2,009 charactersBoilermaker88, Nov 08, 2003

The smell is a nice citrusy hops with a bit of alcohol behind it. The taste is a very nice balance of hops, not overly done, but with a great balance behind it, and a hint of alcohol that doesn't take away from the beer at all. Mouthfeel is slightly heavy. Drinkability, quite good, and could have a few.
A tremendous IPA, without being hop juice. I hope I'll be able to find this one in Western PA in the near future. I'll definitely have this one again!! 536 charactersbeergeek279, Nov 08, 2003

4.47/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4This is not a commonly found beer in Philly so I was excited to find a 22 oz bomber at the Foodery. When I cracked open the bottle, the fragrant aroma wafted up to my nose. It had that classic citric grapefruit smell. It lacks the pungent notes of several other imperial IPAs The aroma is beautiful and can be detected from several feet away.
 The pour took a bit of time. There was a rocky had that held up well. The color seemed to be a dark golden hue with a hazy quality. The room was a bit dim so I can't be exact on hue. But the flavor was wonderful. The hops lent a bitterness from start to finish. It was not as heavy as some other imperial IPAs but that made for an enjoyable experience. There were hints of sweetness in the beer too. They didn't scrimp on the malts here. This is a must try beer for hopheads. 822 charactersfuchebu, Nov 01, 2003

Sorry everybody, but I don't like this beer. I hope I move it down in the rankings (edit: damn I didn't) because it made me mad. Maybe its just an off night or something for me, but this beer really is no good! 
I'll admit the nose is quite nice, huge citrus hops cascade and centennial I would venture, with a hint of yeastyness and ethanol there. 
The taste is huge, its too huge. Its not interesting, it simply rumbles over your tongue. This beer crosses the line. It seems like an excuse to make a stupidly big beer. DFH 90 min is what I think an IIPA should taste like...big but interesting and doing something other than gouping up my mouth. This beer is cloyingly sweet, extremely sweet. I think a really hoppy beer should be balanced with maltiness, NOT SUGAR. My mouth is now coated with a resinous shalack like syrup GODAMMIT! I hate that. The hops and alcohol (which is really obvious in this disaster of a beer) are giving me bad heartburn and I spilled it on my nice leather chair and it was a sticky fucking mess! 
All in all, I say tone it down. I couldn't drink another one of these if I had to.
2-20-2005 UPDATE
Well...I had to give it another shot after my horrible experience last year. It it's on 7$ a bomber here which is cheaper than the 10$ I was told to expect. I just have to say that it wasn't my mood or a bad bottle or anything. I hated the beer this time and had to move the mouthfeel rating DOWN to 2.0. This stuff is like barely liquid cotton candy. Blech. It is so syrupy. I have to say that the american hop flavors are incredible, but far far too much. It tastes like they found out how to artificially synthesize american hop flavors and they poured a gallon of these chemicals into each bottle. Well this is certainly a technical achievement, it makes horrible beer. But do have to praise the lacing. Really impressive. 1,886 characterscerevisiaephilus, Oct 13, 2003

Aroma: Sharp, sharp citrusy hops. Citrusy sweetness is evident in the aroma, but it smells more grapefruity and sour than orangey and sweet.
Taste: Wow. Bitterness flows through the tongue. Malt is present, but the hops are making their stand. Piney and citrus are obvious, but citrus wins the mvp award. Sweetness from the malt makes the citrus hops happy. Great mouthfeel, long loving aftertaste.
Notes: Your tongue will not fall asleep drinking this beer. Please drink more and enjoy yourself... One of my new favorites. 595 charactersbeerinator, Oct 09, 2003

5/5  rDev +13.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Let's start out by saying there is no quesiton why this beer is so highly sought after, you'll know from the second you crack the bottle. Appears: a deep copper orange hue with a huge frivilous cream colored long-lived head that has left me with some visually appealing full bars of lacing. Aroma: Now this is the selling point of this beer a succulent layer of piney hops masked by an undertow of earthy floral hops this beer is just as malty as it is hoppy adding to the balance and pure greatness of it. If it makes sense this beer's aroma smells like buttery sweet caramelized whole leaf hops it's hard to picture that but once you smell this you realize why this is the most incredible hop nectar I have ever quaffed. Taste: Equally if not surpassingly more amazing than the aromatics, layers of sugar and hop bitterness blend into one orgy of flavor on the palate the piney, slightly earthy, citrus tones of the hops are met with an equally amazing caramel syrupy sugar quality from the malts used here. Clears out the sinuses with hop bitterness and fulfills your sweet tooth at the same time, now that's what I call a beer. Mouthfeel: The creamy texture sends you directly into complete indulgence mode here with juicy hop resin and a full bodied via the malt profile this beer is here to please not only beer enthusiasts but to turn the macro drinker toward the light. Drinkability: Well, it has to rank up there in one of my most amazing tasting experiences of all time, Three Floyd's has redefined an Imperial IPA for me watchout west coast here comes the midwest. So, good and drinkable if I were to come across this beer on tap somebody call the D.D. or better yet let's flag down a bloody taxi because whoever is with me is going to imbibe and enjoy this revolutionary beer at my side. 1,799 charactersWVbeergeek, Sep 24, 2003
4.59/5  rDev +4.6%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Sampled February 2004
Pours a hazy copper-orange color and is topped by a beige head that is middle of the road in thickness & creaminess. Gawd-damn, intense aromas of citrus fruit waft from my glass. Lychee, grapefruit, orange, tropical fruit, hop nectar, a sweetness all are here in the nose of this beer. The aroma is just amazing on this beer, I really don't think that the smell could get much better than this. This beer is quite sweet in taste. The lychee taste from the hops is quite intense & very impressive. If there was such thing as honey made from hop nectar this beer is what that would taste like. This beer does not seem nearly as bitter as the Alpha King from 3-Floyds, though this is probably because this beer has the body & malt backbone to back up the intense onslaught of fresh hop flavor & bitterness.
This beer is certainly a sipping beer, the combination of the hop intensity and the body/ mouth feel of this beer require quite contemplation of each sip. The fruitiness in this beer is what really sets it apart. It is so intensely fruity & tropical that it makes me wonder if the fruitiness is not from the hops alone, and is in fact part of the yeast character. In the end I think that 3-Floyds has just packed this puppy with fruity-citrusy hops until it is ready to burst. This is just confirmation that my first opinion of this beer was just.
Sampled August, 2003
Smells strongly fruity, comes at you with a right hook of lychee and grapefruit aromas. Nice amber gold color (with golden highlights). This beer is a very well balanced attack of American hops that hangs on a modest malt backbone. There is lots of hop flavor in this one, with lots of fruity hoppy notes. The taste is lightly sweet as well with a good amount of body to it. Overall this is a very well put together beer with a wonderful balance. 1,849 charactersGueuzedude, Sep 22, 2003

don't drink this beer too cold, if you froze it , it would not suppress the calling of the hop! only by letting it warm would the malt come through to bring a slight balance. the last drink was more enjoyable then the first. truly an electrifying experience from three floyd's, i would love to do it again! 607 charactershopjack13, Sep 22, 2003
4.82/5  rDev +9.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Hey, do you like getting smacked in the face? How about by a beer? 
Ya, you do! Who's your Daddy? Dreadnaught! That's who!
To start off, how anyone can finish an entire bomber of this stuff without being smashed in the face by the massive amount of hops in this beer is beyond human. Ahhh, but it was a pure pleasure to let this beer slap me around for an hour and a half as I nursed the hell out of it. 
Color is a chill hazed peachy toned orange with a spongy frothed bone white head thats about an inch high and settles moderately down to a hazey top with some bigger bubbles that never leave the edge and the lace lays across the glass in sheets that diminish into strings and spots.
Aroma is absolutely wonderful, super fresh and floral, I'm talking right off the vine and right in your nostrils and down your throat fresh hop cones here. Big floral presense and a nice mix of pine needles and peachy/pineapple hop resin and acidic hoppyness with a smidge of grapefruit and a super fine toasty caramel malt backing. Alcohol warmth hits slowly as it warms. 
Tasting this is like liquidfied hops or something, super amounts of very floral and fresh resinated hops all up in your business. Complexing floral hops taking total control of your senses and making you recognize its presense as you prepare yourself sip after sip for the next wave of citrus. Super full of hops, almost too much, its crazy but absolutely wonderful to behold. The bitterness is quite calming actually, its just a whole lot of fresh; light pine, peach, pineapple, and some grapefruit rinds play along the surface with some juicy factions right away in the front of bringing more of the peach and pineapple, but the largely floral aspect then blooms over the palate and relinquishing it over and over as you surrender to its spellbinding hoppy hold leading through huge fields and tall vines of freshly picked hops eventually leading you back to a quick crispy little hop finish and backing up every sip is a remarkable toasty little caramel malt. Some notes of wood and earth strike the palette in some of the finish as well. 
Full mouthfeel throughout, each ambrosial sip and heavenly gulp is packed full of hoppy flavor and body. Slick and creamy. Way too smooth for the evident hop profile brimming with citrus tones. Don't get me wrong, it was incredibly, delightfully, pleasurably, enjoyable to get pushed around by this whale of a beer. Head swimmingly delishious! Another keeper by 3F! 2,484 characterstavernjef, Sep 14, 2003

HAs a hazy orange-amber appearance with a thick white head that slowly dissapates into a thin lace. You would never guess that this is 9.5%. Well after you try to stand up you'll probably realize it, but not from the taste. The hop aroma is very piney with grapefruit coming through in the taste. Another beer following the trend that bigger is better. Maybe the hops are a little extreme, but this beer isn't for everyone. It's for the hopheads. 509 charactersdmarch, Sep 12, 2003

It pours a light umbery orangy colour with a bit of haze from the yeasty bits floating around. Nice rocky foamy head that stuck around. The smell is that great citrusy hoppy aroma in spades. The taste is well ---- its damn near amazing. Nice strong malt and a blast of hops. It is definately not for the timid. The mouth feel is smooth with the residual drying effects of the hops. Drinkability is high-- perhaps too high considering the ABC of this beer.. You can seemingly drink it all night, but if you do .. the morning will be hell. 614 charactersTinusTime, Sep 11, 2003

This monster pours a golden orange with a very slight haze, which the bottle describes as a result of bottle conditioning. Huge foamy uneven head..this brew means business. Aroma hits you like a ton of ripe grapefruits. Massive citrous hop aroma, just begging to be sipped. Tons of hop citrous flavors dominate the palate, and my nose is singed with an alcohol bite. Decent malt backbone here as well, balancing things out bit. This beer is bitter, but the massive flavors of grapefruit and orange rind keep things in check. An assault on the senses. What sets this out front is the decent malt backbone and completely resinous mouthfeel. It's thick and slightly sticky, full of hop resins. Drinkabilty is top notch for a beer of this caliber. I could drink this all night (but i'm scared). The best IPA, if not beer, I've had. 942 charactersavylover, Sep 10, 2003
4.4/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Poured with a very large tan head that lingered for a good while, eventually dissipating to a good lace. Nice orange-amber color. Slight haze at first which cleared as beer warmed. Carbonation rises to the surface from the sides of the glass. The aroma immediately smacked me in the face from a couple feet away. Smells of hops and fruit - orange, pineapple, and fruit cocktail were all noticeable. Lots of hops hit the tongue, yet the taste was quite fruity sweet as well with some spice notes towards the end. Malt is apparent, but I think the sweetness in this beer is more from the hops. Dry finish with a somewhat bitter aftertaste that lingers for a while; the hops continuing to maintain a foothold. Theres a very full, smooth, slick, mouthfeel. Carbonation is moderate. Slight alcohol feel, but for the most part the alcohol is very well hidden, although it does become more apparent as the beer warms. Careful though... At 9.5%ABV, if you cant taste it, youll certainly feel it! Great brew, but the high alcohol content does lower the drinkability of this one a bit. This beer was very complex, and seemed to have lots going on. When I finished this brew, I though to myself... If the Belgians brewed an IPA, this is what it would be. I could probably drink a few of these (not in succession though) and find different nuances each time. 1,352 charactersbyrd, Sep 09, 2003

Appearance: Deep orange in color with a rocky white head that throws itself against the sides of the glass, splattering a lovely lace all over the glass.
Smell: Hoppy, Hoppy, Hoppy...Joy, Joy, Joy (obscure "Ren & Stimpy" reference). To duplicate the aroma, do the following: Cut down a pine tree, buy a case each of grapefruit and lemons. Cram everything into a blender. Liquify. Add some medicinal alcohol at the end. Simply amazing aroma from this beer.
Taste: It's a little doughy sweet at first, but Mr. Hoppy introduces himself to you quickly. Grapefruit flavor assaults the palate, which is in turn finally wrestled to the ground by an alcohol-soaked bees' nest of honey. Surprisingly short aftertaste, with a hoppy blast nearing the end followed by a smile-inducing wamring effect of the alcohol....MAN! To have this beer on a cold winter's day after a grueling snowboarding session!
Mouthfeel & Drinkability: Any beer that launches hoppy, resin-laden burps after 2 minutes scores big in my book. Low levels of carbonation and an amazingly smooth mouthfeel are a joy to behold. My lips are coated with pine tar! Drinkabilty is dangerous. I had to physically move the beer out of arm's length to avoid draining this in record time. This beer can really kick your ass in a hurry.
This one ranks right up there in my book. Excellent hoppy influence and a great mouthfeel.

Pours a deep ruby/brown color topped off by a moderately thick white head, which left a thin, sticky lace splattered on the sides of my glass. The aroma is definitely not for the faint of heart. A healthy punch of what seems like a thousand types of hops, attacks the olfactory senses, leaving them begging for mercy. Slight aromas of smoke, fruit and alcohol are also detected. The bold taste of hops will beat you down like a pimp beating his ho. There is a nice sweet and charred oak flavor left on the palate on the finish. This is one vastly complex brew, how can they fit so much hop flavor into one bottleI guess well never know. 674 charactersScooter77, Sep 07, 2003

For a beer this delicious, it's a challenge to drink most of a bomber. My wife had a few sips then gave me her share to finish (too alcoholic for her taste).
A copper colored nectar with thick creamy foam. HUGE aroma of fresh hops, grapefruit,hop resins and oils, deep floral hops. Layers upon layers of hop aromas with some alcohol sneaking in (and a bit of smokiness) Very full bodied but not sticky or cloying, sweet bold complex malt flavors battling with citrus hops and alcohol. I can pick out caramel,raisins,light molasses flavors with overripe cherries,cedar, and tobacco. A rather dry pleasant bitterness in the finish. This is a very bold, aggressive Imperial IPA where you have to battle the alcohol dragon to finish the glass, not for the light hearted or hop impaired! Beware... 863 charactersjeffboo, Sep 05, 2003

Aroma is powerful! Hops, flowers, grapefruit, malt... it's sharp and dry, and has almost an ammonia tingle around the edge.
Very chewy and creamy in the mouth. It starts sweet, then it fills the mouth with buzzing hops and just the right amount of bitterness.
Taste is a huge mix. Hops... sourness... creamy sweetness... all tumbling over each other like ten Dalmatian puppies racing down a staircase. Citrus, fruit, lots of pale ale sweetness expanded but not out of balance.
An excellent "large" IPA, certainly up there with Stone and Rogue, and, like those beers, able to maintain its balance. 682 charactersDarkale, Aug 21, 2003

Pours with a beautiful firm head with nice tight bubbles. Moderate lacing. What really hits you though is the aroma of floral hops and bananna. The taste is also higly floral and fruit-driven, with an awesome moutfeel and lovely grapefruit overtones. Great hoppy finish, that lasts and lasts.

Oh yeah.... an orangey/amber colored bier, though a touch hazy (without any yeasties yet introduced). Head is off-white, about 1/4", and fine & creamy. A slow procession of intermittetant bubbles slowly make their way surface-ward. Lacing, too, is nice!
Aroma is a toasty/biscuity maltiness along with some citrus components....not too potent, overall, though. 
Body is medium-plus, and the Naught has a velvety/smooth feel on the tongue. Gotta love it! 
Taste? Well... bready/toasty malt starts off...nicely sweet, and a bit honey-ish, sort of like the Bells Two Hearted in that respect. Fruity hops start to butt in...peachy/grapefruity, even some apricot and pine-apple.... a blissful cornucopia of light fruit flavors. This is a very nice change-up over the west-coast/cascady/grapefruit-loaded hoppy IPAs!! Bring it on!! I believe this means I have sampled 48 of the current top 50!! A big time thnx to FeloniusMonk for throwing this bomber in my direction!!! Prosit!!!!

 Pours a nice medium head, immediatly the hops surround your senses. You could sit there for 5 minutes just enjoying the floral aroma, hops, and subtle grapefruit hints without even needing to take a sip yet. But that first sip is magnificent. Sparkles nicely on your tongue as the citrusy hops take over leaving you with a literal rush of "holy damn, this beer is perfect". The high alcohol content is hidden expertly in the flavor, and no way manifests itself in any sweetness aspect. The second sip keeps you happy with the overall complexity of flavor and aroma of this IPA. The body is a amberish gold, a little cloudy. Be warned though, this beer is about 10% alcohol. The draft kegs are consistant in flavor from keg to keg, and comes in soda pins and 1/2 barrels. If you have yet to try this on draft, FIND IT NOW before it's too late. Comperable beers:
 Dogfishhead 90min IPA 893 charactersFirkinDave, Jul 30, 2003
4.9/5  rDev +11.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Presentation: 16oz. Shaker pint from draught. Cost: $4.50 at The Chapter House, Ithaca
Appearance: Poured a burnished, antique-gold color, with an inner glow similar to Fullers, but cloudier. Came with a very dense, whipped-meringue head that persisted throughout the pint.
Smell: What can I say that hasnt already been said. The usual adjectives like piney, resinous, leafy, and hoppy fail to convey the effect achieved here. The hops are vibrant, floral, and fruity; while not letting up on pure hoppiness.
Taste: Again, the usual descriptors don't suffice. 3 Floyds has created a beer that is both strongly bitter and satisfyingly smooth and sweet; like a perfectly balanced sweet-and-sour dish. Like eating candied hops. The hops are perfectly accompanied by tastes of spicy ginger, pineapple, nectarine, roasted malt, earthiness, and lemon zest. Swallows had the mentholated after-effect of a Ricola. The flavor goes on and on, warming the mouth and stomach like an after-dinner drink, easily standing up to the strong taste of an aged Cuban cigar.
Mouthfeel: Unctuous, mouth-filling, big-bodied, and simultaneously bracing and warming. Like Icy-Hot for the mouth. On draught, this was perfectly carbonated; silky, flavorful, smooth, and cool. Super-smooth, with a buttery, caramelized feel to it, resulting in a very long, surprisingly gentle finish. The sweetness lengthens as the beer warms. 
Drinkability: I dont care what the ABV is! I'd gladly drink this beer until I dropped. Dangerously quaffable. 
Dreadnaught was the designation given to the indomitable first-rate ships-of-the line in the British Navy (and later Star Trek starships) that carried 100 or more guns. Like those, this dreadnaught certainly packs a punch and fears no other IPA, imperial or otherwise. Unlike its namesake in the Royal Navy though, this is a remarkably subtle beer, an iron fist in a velvet glove. I never thought I'd contemplate giving an overall 5 to a beer before, but this might be it. I previously wrote that my "desert island" beer would be Duvel, but this has tested my loyalties. This beer was so good, it converted a few non-beer lovers right off the bat. I havent had the privilege of trying this in bottles yet, but you can rest assured I shall not rest until I do. And I thought that the 90-Minute IPA was impressive!
Bottom Line: Probably the best all-around beer Ive ever had, and Im not always an IPA lover. This one makes me a believer. 2,483 charactersDantes, Jul 30, 2003
4.57/5  rDev +4.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Ok, I have to admit, all those people who have been trumpeting the praises of Three Floyds were right. This is an awesome beer. The aroma is very hoppy. It's what you'd get if you could crossbreed tangerines with a pine or a juniper plant. I'm also getting whiffs of balloon rubber, but that doesn't make any sense. The flavor is surprisingly well balanced. I was expecting some major hops bitterly unbalancing the beer, but the hops are nicely balanced by the thick almost chewy malt flavors. The perceived bitterness is surprisingly low with the actual flavors of the hops coming through. The malt is toasted buttered biscuits with a bit of caramel sauce and maybe a little maple syrup. The beer is sweet, but not cloying. The body is a dark amber topped by a nice too-dark-to-be-off-white head that isn't a permanent fixture, but not wimpy either. Damn this is good. 869 charactersaracauna, Jul 29, 2003
4.52/5  rDev +3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 422oz. bomber poured into a pint glass. It pours a slightly hazy orangish-amber color with one finger of head. There is good head retention and lacing throughout. The smell was a burst of citrus, mostly grapefruit, and hops. The hop smell is not overwhelming at all, very nice. The taste is a near perfect blend of sweet malt and fresh hops. This one is not overboard on the hops as the "imperial" IPA label would suggest. The fruitiness can still be found in the taste too. The body is thick and almost chewy, good for an IPA. The drinkability is fairly nice for being a 9.5% brew. What a marvelous IPA! 603 charactersSheepNutz, Jul 14, 2003
4.87/5  rDev +10.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5As soon as opened the bottle the aroma just blasted right out at me and I knew I was in for a treat. Big citrusy aroma, orange, passionfruit, grapefruit and white grapes come to mind. Beautiful almost orange color, slightly cloudy from the bottle fermentation and a frothy head yielding good retention. This is the biggest IPA I've had that wasn't from the west coast. This ale has a smooth medium bodied texture that is slightly chewy and nearly perfect. I find this similar to Moylans Double IPA and maybe even better. Flavors are grapefruit, hops and more hops with malt somewhere in the background. Only a slight bitterness in the finish. I didn't realize the abv was 9.5, and wouldn't have known it if I hadn't read it here. I didn't taste it but I certainly feel it. This is one giant IPA. If your a fan of the big west coast IPA's as I am, you will love this one! 870 charactersBierReise, Jul 11, 2003

OK, I'm four feet away from my glass and I can clearly smell the hops - Grapefruit and floral (Iris?) notes! Upon closer inspection, its even more floral - cherry blossom, touch of rose, bit of orange. Lots of raw hop aroma, but the grapefruit is dominant. Simply stunning. If the malt came through at all on the nose, it would be perfect, as it is its still a "5" easy.
Fortunately the malt is there in spades on the palate. In fact, malt is amazingly the first thing to make an impression on the palate - nice round bready malt. Tons of hop flavor, without being stewed hops - lots of pine and resin, a whole range of citrus led by grapefruit, and a touch of mint. Simply stunning. 
Its incredibly long, but incredibly well-balanced - all of the elements are there to the death. Bottle-conditioned softness in the mouthfeel, but a slightly higher carbonation rate would have kept the beer from becoming a little tiring for the palate. Not even a hint of the alcohol anywhere between fridge temp and room temperature (it took me a long time to finish the bomber). Outstanding beer.
22 oz. bomber. Bottled by the brewery in Munster. 1,276 charactersRealale, Jul 07, 2003
4.64/5  rDev +5.7%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5I was as surprised by this-one as a big headed guy on the label. As it says on the bottle, its not normal. It pours a cloudy amber-orange with a very nice two-inch sticky head. Lace is very well. Carbonation is good to produce soft white hang-around bubbles.The aroma is most impressive. Alot hits you from the beginning to end with a floral, citrus dose of hop. The taste, again complex. You got citrus with grapefruit at the start. Sweet, almost a wine cooler citrus taste, then a surprise hop kick all the while a nice warmth blankets it all. This is the most creamy smooth IPA i've had to date. It has a cotton soft feel but does not leave a cotton mouth. Drinkability, almost to drinkable. At 9.5abv it would be easy to get ahead of ones self. With all thats being smelled and tasted here, im good for about one 12 oz. per serving, but thats just me. 855 characterschilidog, Jul 07, 2003
4.44/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Sampled at the Map Room on the AHA National Pub Crawl. 
I had this beer for the first time after a week in Seattle, hop city. After that time there, I thought I'd never taste anything as hoppy as those Seattle beers for a while.
This beer however proved that false.
The beer pours into the glass with a low rough rocky head that cements itself to the glass.
Aroma of grapefruit and grassy hops hits the consumer at a full arms length from the glass. 
The flavori is caramely sweet with a large crystal and warm feel before a long and brutal hop slap. The hops combined with the toasty malt brings a lingering cinnamon spice and a final lemony hop character to the final taste. 691 charactersdrewbage, Jul 05, 2003
4.72/5  rDev +7.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Appearance: Pours a mostly clear copper that seems to glow on it's own. It's tan head starts out thick and creamy, then slowly shrinks down to a small, but steady cap. Tons of spiderweb-like lace cover the side of the glass.
Smell: The aroma is positively stunning. It's nothing less than a hop explosion right under your nose. Massive amounts of grapefruit, pine, citrus, apricot, and pineapple (yes, pineapple!) hold their own against a heavy onslaught of sweet, caramelly malt. There's a touch of breadiness as well. Raw, pungent, and perfect...
Taste: Starts off a bit sweet, then quickly erupts into a full-blown hop assault. Raw grapefruit rind, pine resin, citrus, apricot, and pineapple all take their turn in the attack. There's a flowery touch to the hops as well. This brew isn't all hops though, and the malt manages to stay afloat for the duration. There's a lingering malty sweetness that has a caramelly and bready flavor that maintains some semblance of balance. Finishes coarse and bitter with barely a hint of alcohol. Wow...just wow.
Mouthfeel: There's a slighty syrupy feel to it, that is offset a bit by the 'just right' carbonation. Finishes dry and bitter. I can 'feel' the warmth of the alcohol more than I can taste it. Adding the yeast dregs towards the end brings a bit of creaminess to an already rich brew.
Drinkability: Damn good for it's strength. It's downright scary that it's 9.5%abv, since the alcohol hides itself so well. This is one of the best examples of an Imperial/Double IPA to be found. It boldly challenges Two Hearted Ale as my favorite IPA. A wonderful example of the 'bigger is better' maxim. 1,652 charactersMJR, Jul 03, 2003

Aroma is very piney hoppy and a hint of fruit, almost a little tomcat. Good bite with hops and malt up front. Actually the malt/hops blend is what makes this such a good beer. Mouthfeel is exceptional. Stays wet on the tongue. I would have guessed this would have a dry finish. It was as far from that as can be. Alchohol is there too 22 oz of 9.5% beer goes a long ways!

4.37/5  rDev -0.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4From the 22 oz. bottle it pours a nice amber with a thick (1.5 fingers), white, foamy, and very persistent head which sticks to the glass throughout consumption. A wonderfully aromatic smell hits you, beginning when you open the bottle and continuing until the last drops are gone. The smells are primarily those of citrus fruits (grapefruit and oranges in particular) and flowers. Great sweet, citrusy, hoppy taste. Very smooth and highly drinkable--although one or two may be all you need. This was my first time drinking this beer and I will certainly come back for some more and it has become one of my current favorites. 625 characterstar, Jun 21, 2003

Now, I am happy to have concluded a 22oz. server of another of their fine, over-the-top, wham-bam-thank-YOU, ma'm brews, the delicious, the delirious, the damnedfine Dreadnaught IPA.
On first cracking the crown, a heavy waft of fruit invades the atmosphere, though the bottle and glass are both held at arm's length.
Appearance: a bright, beautiful ruby red, with a good, fluffy, creamy head.
Aroma: bows to no one. Sharp pine resin, grapefruit, spruce?, tar, citrus fruit, and that's it, but that's quite an it, and IT'S in full effect, y'all.
An invasion of flavor, an armada embarking it's onslaught upon every sensory receptor open and ready to receive. Tasty fruitiness recurrs with every sip, rewarding the drinker anew, long-lasting finish, almost sticking in the throat and taking up residence permanently on the palate. Malt is nearly an even match for hops, almost, barely, but at least they provide quite sufficient ballast and body that makes this quite a drinkable brew. 
Fruit factor turns a trifle sweet after a time, but hop bitterness is always at hand to combat it. 
This would count among the list of beers to spoil myself to death with, if I were so inclined, and were capable of...I'll have another, and another, and a..whoops! too much! But, to quote Louis Jordan, "I'll die happy!" 1,429 charactersfeloniousmonk, Jun 13, 2003

4.47/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Dreadnaught Imperial IPA from Three Floyds. In the brand new bomber bottle. Although I wasnt happy about it, this beer was worth wait. This is one fine beer, by any comparison. It poured a fairly clear amber color, which was somewhat surprising, as I had expected some hazing. The head was an above average height, leveling off to a faily constant 1/8th inch coverage.
The aroma was terrific, deep, rich and very appealing. It was, to no ones surprise, dominated by the hops, which had a piney aroma, with a crisp snap of floral scents as well.
Clearly, this is a beer that should be about the hops, and it certainly is, but this beer is much more about flavor than power. It had a rich malty base that served as a perfect accompaniment to the hops. And what hops there were: floral, piney, deep rich and complex.
The mouthfeel was not as syrupy as the other Imperial IPAs that Ive had, and this was the factor that set it apart from the others that Ive had. Truly wonderful. 994 charactersjackndan, May 29, 2003
4.9/5  rDev +11.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5This masterpiece pours a brilliant amber, no cloudiness here, pretty damn good clarity. A large and well-retaining head forms and stays at a quarter inch throughout consumption and also provides lacing like no other IPA I have seen. Holy happy horseshit, what an aroma! Wickedly strong hops, pine forest, pine needles, pine everything. Citrus twang is in there as well, but pine is where it's at. I would just drench a piece of cardboard in this beer and use it as an air freshener in my car instead of purchasing a pine hanger. 
How splendid the syrupy and piney hops are in this brew. The palate is coated so well that it might not ever be back to it's original state. And there is definitely nothing wrong with that. How can this be so wonderful!?! Pain with my pleasure! Well it's not painful, but it's numbing. Numbing with my pleasure! lol There's definitely enough balance in there to provide some serious drinkability for such an extremely hopped brew. The alcohol is pleasantly warming and very well masked. Exceptional is an understatement for this beer. This beer is a voyage. It's like smoking a certain plant for the first time. It's rough and overwhelming, yet you're just drawn back to it with uncanny yearning for the sweet and calming aura it creates. Go buy it, go buy it now. 1,295 charactersAudioGilz, May 26, 2003
4.92/5  rDev +12.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5This is the real deal. Three Floyds has a real winner with this beer. For a hophead this is a dream come true. Dreadnaught was menacing straight out of the growler with an aggressive, revearse cascading pour, exposing a foggy amber color and a puffy, cumulous head that settled into a thick slick along the top of the beer with great lace retention. On inspection from my nose the Dreadnaught revealed an intense pressure of hops. There were huge citrus aromas in the form of mango, orange and lime and notes of sour apple and cherry. Dreadnaught tickled my pallate and flowed down my throat with such ease. The hops were not at all overwhelming as there was a a fair bit of malts, which had a wonderful equilibrium between smokey undertow and candied fruits for an interseting brandy effect. Thanks to the malts there is a perfect balance in what would have been a too intense flavor.This beer kicks some serious ass! 918 charactersGreatPondBrewer, May 24, 2003
4.64/5  rDev +5.7%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Ah, is there any better aroma than that of a Truly Magnificent Beer? In my humble opinion, NO, Dreadnaught is a beer I have looked forward to sampling, since I read the first review, thanks to cretemixer; I now have that opportunity. In addition, one other thing I have noticed, on this site and others, either you love it or you dislike it intensely.
On the pour the beer appears an unclouded copper color with the head Bunyanesque in size and spumescent in texture, the color a lovesome light tan. Ah that smell, the freshness of a Pine forest after a spring rain combined with the heady aroma of fresh picked hop flowers, the delightful sweet malt underpinnings, citrus crisp and fresh, a treat for the olfactory senses, hell a treat for the eyes also. Start is sweet to the point of distraction, the malt thick and chewy, the top middling in its feel to the palate. Finish pleasantly acidic, the hops ferine in their bite, bittersweet, purposeful and a very dry aftertaste, with the hops sticking to your taste buds for days, and one fine quaffing beer, my vote, I love it!
As a point of interest this is certainly not a beer for the weak of palate, or those not into hops or high ABV, so my advise, leave it alone as the rest of us Hop Heads, will certainly appreciate it. 1,303 charactersGusler, May 24, 2003

Brownish golden color with an off-white head that leaves lace. 
Huge citrus hop aroma. 
Taste is (of course) big and bold. Big malt body. Huge hop profile. Grapefruit-like, with lots of citrus hop flavors and some piney as well. I really enjoyed it more and more as it warmed and it's great malt character increasingly showed.
Good, creamy mouthfeel.
Very enjoyable and drinkable for a beer this massive.

Another of the high octane IPAs that are spreading eastward from their west coast spawning ground. This is a good beer, sweeter than some of its westcoast cousins, but from the bottle it is a bit more pedestrian than Stone's Ruination.
The body is a nice a clear copper, with no haze and a very slight cream head that laces somewhat.
The aroma is grapefruit and pine with an underlying sweet maltiness.
The taste is well-balanced between the grapefruit hop flavors and the sweet caramel malts. No bitterness to burn your palate and the malt sweetness is a bit syrupy on the back of the tongue.
Overall this is a good beer, but doesn't knock my socks off like I had hoped. Actually that is incorrect, the alcohol does knock my socks off, but not the flavor. 835 charactersbrakspear, May 22, 2003

4.87/5  rDev +10.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Perhaps the finest ale brewed in Indiana, Dreadnaught pours a glowing orange with a fluffy, off-white head that keeps itself throughout the duration of the brew. A lovely picture, indeed. The smell is huge on hops, citrus, pine, you name it. Everything you could ask for in an over-the-top imperial IPA. Taste is nothing short of intense, and is not for the faint of heart. Huge notes of just plain raw hops exist throughout the life of the brew, and linger long after. Even though it's incredibly hopped, it seems very well balanced, too, with a sturdy malt backbone holding its own along the way. Mouthfeel was very smooth and oily, especially from the handpull. Drinkability was very strong for a beer of 9.5% ABV. This is a keeper, indeed, and one that's not to be taken lightly. 783 charactersJon, May 17, 2003

Head-exploding aromatics. Pine and spruce and citrus and reefer and metal and butter and toffee. 
Taste begins with a smattering of mangoes and apricots. Hoppy from the get-go. Tempered by a buttery toffee base, especially when it approaches room temperature. Spruce and pine enter, and begin a virtual peepshow of hops. Grapefruit strolls out next, wearing next to nothing. Then comes Metal in a lacy, see-through number. Tea struts her stuff next, and demands dollar bills. Surprising spicy. I'd like to see the actual hop profile. Rum-like alcohol sweetness looms towards the closure, but leans more towards gin overall. 
Never, ever bitter. In fact, this is balanced to a fault. If this was more bitter, I'd be inclined to give it perfect scores. 
Heavy, slightly syrupy body. Sweet but does not cloy. Drinkable beyond logic. 
I expected to be raped and pillaged, instead I got a savvy diplomat. 1,016 characterscokes, May 16, 2003

Pours a clear, deep amber in color with a frothy, ivory colored head. It fades to a thick layer after several minutes leaving a solid lace. Aroma of resinous pine, lush citrus fruits, and sweet malts. The first sip always pleases. Piney and smooth, with that oh so important bitter edge. The malt is also present to balance this beer just right. Well not quite balance as the hops will never relent. Thick, slick and chewy make for a great combo. The carbonation is low to medium & the body is full. The 9.5% ABV is well hidden making for a very drinkable imperial IPA. I love this beer. 609 characterscretemixer, Apr 05, 2003
4.17/5  rDev -5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 412(?)oz mini-growler from Half Time Beverages. A thanks to VENOM for the sample.
Appearance: Nearly pumpkin orange in colour, slight chill haze. Thin cropped white lace does an excellent job of sticking to the glass.
Smell: Big wafts of fresh hop oil smack the nose around a bit; sweet pine sap and some citric rind. Light fruitiness, faint esters and some diacetyl in the aroma as well.
Taste & Mouthfeel: Light carbonation but real smooth and creamy with a slickness in the mouth. A constant barrage of hops hits the palate right from the get go and does not cut any slack. Sweetness does come from an ample maltiness but more so from sweet hop oil that borders and overwhelming pungent sensation. Higher alcohols are held to a minimum but it is quite warming. Touches of bready grain and buttery flavours, the hops just keep coming with a huge wall of bitterness and piney citric flavour. Finishes slightly on the sweet side but still puckering from the hops.
Drinkability & Notes: Very deceiving alcohol, hops are out of control but done in a perfect way. An amazing brew that warmed me up on this cold winters day. 1,131 charactersJason, Feb 11, 2003

A perisitent string of lace was noticed from start to finish. The aroma consists of these waves of hops that entice you, but warn you that this brew is going to give that palate a workout. It didn't disappoint. This beautiful combination of a piney and critic hoppy taste were overwhelming at the start. But, a balanced mouthful of a creamy, malty, sweet finish, gave this brew a higher level of drinkability than I was unexpecting. This is definitely one delicious Imperial IPA. 598 charactersrotsaruch, Jan 12, 2003

I served this beer on tap untill the supply ran out but more is on the way! This is a work of art. Slight chill haze on draft, deep golden color, amazing hop / malt nose - both citrusy spicey hop and honey sweet malt aroma would fill the room when this beer was tapped. The balance is unbelievable; intense hoppy flavors and bitterness equalled by the intesity and richness of full bodied mega malt. Alcohol is evident from initial sniff to burps hours later. Rich, complex and very hoppy. A truly great achievment for hop and malt heads alike. 8.5% alc / vol and very dangerous because its oh sooo good! Makes a great Imperial half n half w/ Victory Storm King Stout. 749 charactersShiredave, Sep 08, 2002
4.87/5  rDev +10.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5My god this is an awesome IPA... apricot gold color, with a huge foamy head that eventually settles to a lace that clings to the side of the glass.  Exceptionally malty and hoppy in both aroma and flavor.  Grapefruit-like hops and carmel malt make this very complex, and at 100 IBU (yes, 100!), and 9.5 % ABV, this thing packs a punch. Since I don't consider myself much of a hop-head, I thought this beer might be too much for me...  I was amazed to find the flavors in perfect balance, and I found myself not even wanting to put the glass down.  This is one huge beer, and it's not for the weak-hearted, but this one is very special. 635 characterszerk, Sep 08, 2002
4.32/5  rDev -1.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Deep amber, pale head, served in one of those peculiar mugs they have at MacGregor's in Syracuse - like a soup bowl with a handle.
Aroma is like hops dipped in caramel. Huge malty sweetness combines with a huge hop hit to create one (duh!) huge brew - I can see why they call it an Imperial IPA. Too IPA-ish to be a barleywine, even at its enormous strength. Finished sweet, bitter, and with a citrusy hop hit that almost makes you stand back and stare in awe. Too huge to drink many of them, just because you'll fall asleep first. Impressive as hell - for hopheads, this is probably close to heaven in a glass. 614 characterssponberg, Sep 02, 2002
4.77/5  rDev +8.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4I made a day trip to the brewery for the sole purpose of trying the IPA.  It was a three hour drive (one way), and worth every second.  Dreadnaught is Alpha King on steroids - bigger, stronger, better in every way!  And since Alpha King is practically an IPA iteslf, well, Dreadnaught is a bit over the top (in a good way).
  Deep reddish-gold body, slightly hazy.  Thick head fades quickly and leaves clinging lace.  Incredible aroma of citrus hops with caramel malt hiding underneath.  Hops dominate the flavor as well, but balanced enough by the malt to allow the drinker to remain sane.  Nice oily mouthfeel, with a slightly dry and bitter finish.  Slightly too over the top and strong (abv 9.5%!!) for a perfect drinkability score, but still one incredibly amazing brew!! 779 charactersViking, Jun 23, 2002
5/5  rDev +13.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I was practically speachless after tasting this masterpiece of beer perfection.  I don't know the specs but this is one big ass beer.  Spicy hop attack, syrupy alcohol, substantial malt presence, more alcohol, peppery hop finish.  Run, don't walk to try this awesome brew! 272 charactersJohn, Sep 19, 2001
