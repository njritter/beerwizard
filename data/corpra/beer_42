Awesome peach and acid aroma with mild wood.  Initial burst of tartness on the palate, vinegar and lightly citric.  White peaches midway: sweet, light, dry and perfectly integrated with the delicate malt.  Subtle oak and funk with underlying white grapes.  No way to tell this is 8%.  So subtle and well blended it tastes like 5%.  Light and creamy feel, perfect carbonation, dry finish.  Subtlety and balance are hallmarks of this gem.  As close to perfection as any beer can achieve. 576 charactersbnes09, Apr 25, 2017

4.71/5  rDev +2.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Pours a clear straw color with a finger of white head even on a small 5oz pour. Head foams up quick with large bubbles, and yet despite this retains well. Aroma gives off notes of apricot and yeast with little else to distract. Flavor profile is the same with an addition of grape. The flavor profiles packs a light tartness that mingles on the edge of sour. It's nothing crazy wild in terms of sour, but just enough to add another dimension to the flavor profile. Mouth feel is fizzy and fuzzy with a medium-thin thickness. Overall, this beer is flavorful. It drinks more like a champagne then anything else. 
Served from a 375mL bottle into a stemmed glass. Reviewed from notes. 681 charactersHarrison8, Mar 12, 2017

This beer has aged a bit, but the peaches are still bursting out of the glass. Sour peach candy, wet hay, bread cracker, oak, subtle band aid. The taste is mouth puckering tart and bursting with peach skin and juicy peach flesh, green apple, white wine, and some lemon. Oak and subtle funk add complexity. I've never had this fresh, but it would seem this is developing some nice complexity in the bottle. Mouth feel is sturdy and on point. Carb is rich and full bodied. Nice acetic vinegar notes add strength to the flavor and edge to the mouth feel. Excellent. 639 charactersdanh53, Feb 23, 2017

A: Light gold with a thin crackly layer of white head.  Good clarity but a bit of haze; a few dots of lacing but pretty good retention.
S: Horseblanket melds effortlessly with bright stone fruit (fleshy peach) and apple juice, rich white wine, with some definite floral notes in support.  Light vanilla fills out the aroma.  Maybe a bit of acetic acid.  The peach is light but still noticeable.  
T: Lots of peach up front, along with mild vanilla and some white wine.  The brett is not really noticeable here, and overall the palate is lacking in complexity compared to the nose.  Moderate to moderate-high sourness—any more time and I think this would cross the Rubicon in terms of acid.  Also, I get a touch of acetic acid. 
M: Medium body and medium-light carbonation.  Doesn’t quite have the finesse (partly the heftier body) that better examples achieve.
O: Overall, a very good fruited sour, but decidedly below god tier.  Glad to see that the peach is still as prominent as it is, given that it can be a subtle flavor. 1,058 characterspmarlowe, Nov 24, 2016

I smell some spicy funk, peach, and peppery hops.
Taste is a little bitter, with spicy hay, weed, and horse blanket, contrasted by sharp Pez, and fresh peach, finishing dry. Good, but was not all I'd built it up to be. Sometimes I wish I'd not heard about some beers before trying them. 391 charactersSabtos, Nov 15, 2016

Lightly hazy golden color.  Light funk, barnyard wheat, oaky, lemon and mild peach on the smell. Very lively.  Taste follows the nose. Mild peach sweetness does show up as you drink along. Mildly acidic.  Well carbonated and medium mouthfeel.  Definitely drinks easier than 8%.
One of the best wild ales. 339 characterseifster82, Oct 29, 2016

4.71/5  rDev +2.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Blend #2 at the Cellar. Cloudy golden color with minimal head and retention. Aroma of barnyard, funky cheese, straw, and peaches. Mild acidity in the flavor but has a deep, complex funk that I seldom experienced. The only downside is that it overpowers the peach. The peach is just a faint wisp of flavor in the dry finish. Medium body and lively carbonated that helps the flavors come through. A beer that lives up to the hype and I am happy to have had the opportunity to try it. 481 charactersmorimech, Oct 21, 2016

Rich, wild barnyard character, but brightened by the peach on your tongue. This isn't as tongue-numbingly acidic as most lambics and I appreciate that. The fruit is mild with a slight sweetness before the acidity washes over again. It's such a nice contrast I'm almost surprised when it hits with every sip. It's almost a shame that a beer needing nearly three years to make is so damn drinkable. Check yourself if you get a bottle. 506 characterstempest, Oct 03, 2016

Smell was super tart and acidic with lots of citrus and peach notes. Lovely barnyard funk on the nose. Taste followed the nose - aggressive tartness up front with a ton of acidic character, lovely peach notes with some barnyard funk, hint of oak, lemon rind, citrus tart, just lovely. Feel was surprisingly light and crisp. Doesn't drink like 8% at all. Medium carbonation.
Overall this is the best wild ale I've ever had. Just incredible - its so much better than any other wild ale out there. 559 charactersFBarber, Sep 21, 2016

Some tart lemon. T: A rich peach. Not the fruity sweet peach like say Wild Peach by NG, but an unripen peach. Some oak, white wine like barrel character. Storm hay and basement funk. Exactly what you want in a peach beer. M: It's a little fuller than your typical sour beer, and the carbonation is on point. Finishes nice and dry with some vinous quality.

A - Poured into a Kate the Great tulip a nice hazy straw hue with a thin white head that fades to leave light wisps. 
S - Aromas of big cheesy earthy funk, genetic stone fruit, pits. Lightly medicinal, still very cheesy.
T - Taste is similar to the nose, big cheesy notes, good lactic tartness,  nice genetic stone fruit pit, good apricot, very nice floral tartness. 
M - Mouthfeel is nicely carbonated, crisp clean. 
O - Overall this is a rather solid stone fruit beer. Very enjoyable, however, a bit too much cheesy funk.

That said, this is one of those beers that was overhyped for me.  I kept reading about the super fresh peach smell and taste which was there but much, much more muted than what I was hoping for.  This falls into the "American Farmhouse" flavors more so than wild/sour.  Not that it makes it bad, it just left me wanting more flavor and punch.  The best thing about this beer is the light, airy, mouthfeel that makes the beer so chuggable.  The bad thing about it is I needed more of it to get a feeling of satisfaction on the palate. 623 charactersabb610, Jun 20, 2016

Look-golden orange, lots of carbonation but it went away quickly and leaves a really thick lacing unlike anything I've seen before from a sour 
Smell-funky, acidic peaches. You can smell the tart. So potent. Amazing
Taste-sour peaches at their absolute best! Get plenty of funk, not too tart, oak especially after warming up some. Lovely fruitiness 
Feel-coats the mouth. Incredibly drinkable. Not too tart. 
Overall-simply amazing. Not an overrated beer by any means and one should seek this out if they enjoy this type even the least bit. Thanks Side Project for an incredible piece of work!!! 672 charactersrabbott2, Jun 19, 2016

A - Beautiful golden orange with a very minimal head that dissipates quick.
S - Funky peaches and some lacto acidity
T - Peach and sour working together in an almost perfect medley. I love all the fruit that's present.
M - Perfect...just perfect. Excellent carb...really couldn't ask for more. 
O - Easily one of the most magnificent beers I've had. I waited a long time to get my hands on one and it was worth the wait. 452 charactersRAlmeida77, Jun 03, 2016

Mild funk, pretty soild, booming acidity, but definltely not an acid bomb like I was expecting. It's about in line with the other 375 mL fruited SP beers. They've all been quite good, but none of them have blown me away. 307 charactersKramerbarthomer, Jun 01, 2016

Peach burps.  A beer so good I actually enjoyed the aftertaste and smell from burping.  All I can say is seek this out and try it.  Just an awesome experience on this humid spring night.  You can read others reviews on the LSTFO but anything less than 4.50 is insanity for this.
Besides Heavy Mettle from Trillium, this beer is easily top 5 of the year for me.  Worth every penny and trade value.  The only negative is that they really should make it in a 750ml though ... 506 charactersBEEPOP, Jun 01, 2016

4.8/5  rDev +4.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Poured from a 375mL bottle into a Side Project long stemmed tulip (wine?) glass. Acquired in a trade.
Pours a lightly hazy, sunny yellow body with a 2 finger white, frothy head that sticks around for quite a while, leaving a good amount of lacing and retention. Looks really nice. 
Aromas are potent and forward - they filled my kitchen upon uncapping this beer. The aromas that come off this beer are absolutely stunning. This is how a wood aged fruited sour should smell, period. Heavy funk and hay, TONS of overripe stone fruit, like you left some peaches out in the sun for a while, definitely tartness going on here, I can't wait to sip it. 
Beautifully complex stone fruit, sour candy, funky yeast, pretty strong sourness, oak, champagne, musty basement, more woodyness on the finish, leaves a puckering sour apple aftertaste, quite dry. Mouthfeel is light, refreshing, effervescent, crisp.
One of the best, if not the best beer I've had this year, and one of the best sours I've ever tasted. All around this is magnificent and world class. Would recommend. 1,067 charactersgcamparone, May 30, 2016

S - that funk is amazeballz, seriously reminds me of a Cantillon aroma.  Some serious tangy peach flows into the nostrils.   It does smell a bit acidic but I'm not sad about it, lets dive in...
T - peaches!!! so good, super carb which makes it light and crisp and full of fruit.
F - a bit acidic at first but the more it sits, the more fluffy and soft it becomes, bordering later on a creamy mouthfeel which is pretty awesome.
O - One that I'm super happy to have finally scored. Side Project holds a special place in my heart and I consider moving to St. Louis overtime I have one of their bottles, just awesome stuff. 732 charactersM_chav, May 02, 2016

I can't believe how well the peach is holding up on this.
Look is slightly cloudy.  It's dark in here.
The smell is what you'd get opening a paper bag of peaches and realizing you left them to ripen a couple days too long.
Peach carries through on the taste.  Tartness emphasizes it or masks it depending of your method of sipping (when I exhale, I really get it)
Mouthfeel fine.  Not thin.
Overall the best peach beer I've had (better than fou for sure).  And since my buddy just bailed on me, I have another glass to look forward to! 604 charactersbennyman12, Sep 24, 2015

4.77/5  rDev +3.9%The aroma has lots of unripen white peach, with lots of tart lemon quality.
The flavor follows and is quite tart. There's peach flavor up front, with some Warhead type tart quality. A touch of funk with a smooth medium plus mouthfeel for the style. A nice dry back end.
Slightly disappointing for the huge hype behind this because of the slightly aggressive tart quality. 373 charactersdar482, Oct 27, 2014

Taste has a fair bit of fuzzy peach, a faint touch of rubber mid palate, moderate to strong acidity in the back, slightly bitter finish.  Body is a bit fuller and heavy, well carbonated, semi dry in the finish.  Gets a little sweet in back. 387 characterscpetrone84, Sep 27, 2014

Pours a hazy bright golden yellow, with a quarter inch head, and a solid amount of lacing.
Smells absolutely incredible- bracing tartness, lactic acid, strong sour peaches, vinegar. Smells incredibly sour.
The taste is really incredible. The peaches start to come through after a few sips, they are quite sour, not really sweet at all, subtle and delicious. The barrel comes through strongly, huge taste of tart white wine, with blinding acidity- huge lactic character here. One of the best sours I've ever tasted. 
The body is fairly light, but not thin, with a tart and crisp mouthfeel. The sour lingers for a very long time.
Next level sour here, absolutely incredible. 708 charactersGreesyFizeek, Sep 25, 2014

IMO, whatever mistakes Cory made in the first few beers he brewed at side project he quickly figured out how to correct them. This is yet another world class beer from Cory. The white wine definitely shines in this one, the acidity and funkiness are phenomenal as always from an SP beer and the subtle peach finish leaves you wanting more and more. Don't see any reason to sit on this beer as the peach is already somewhat absent and the sourness is there already...drink up! 501 charactersjaken0ss, Aug 27, 2014

Pours a murky bright yellow color with one inch of bright white head. Super sour nose and taste, peaches, sour white wine, oak, floral notes. Taste is very vinegary and has more sour fruits and oak. Acedic , light to medium body.
Overall a really good sour. Way more sour and vinegary than fruity, but really great. Worth seeking out for sure. 477 charactersmdfb79, Aug 20, 2014

4.23/5  rDev -7.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25A:  aggressive pour yields two finger white head that dissipates quickly.  Rich golden-peach color, yeast accumulation in the bottom of the bottle but doesn't follow to the glass.  Leaves legs on glass that dissipate slowly.  Looks nice.
S: prominent sweet peach aroma with a definite vinegary complement.  Some distinctive funk, a bit musty, lemony, cheesy, almost gueuze-like.  A slight bready aroma underlies, almost like a peach danish.
T: lemon, vinegar, lots of funk, cheese, yogurt tartness.  Peach flavor is definitely there but a bit overwhelmed by the significant tartness and acidity.  tastes like an earthy gueuze with peach added.
M: thick, rich, coats the tongue with almost a yogurty smoothness.  Pretty dry despite the adequate carbonation.  Pretty unique.
O: much different than I expected.  On one hand, I don't get as much peach flavor as I expected or as much as other American peach sours I have had.  On the other hand, its gueuze-like character is good in its own way and the peach complements it well and in a unique way I have not ever encountered.  I just think the vinegar and funk overwhelms a bit.  While not necessarily my favorite peach sour, it is well-done, complex, and unique.  Dunno if it is worth the price of admission but enjoyable nonetheless. 1,287 charactersIrishColonial, Jul 23, 2014

A truly amazing sour. Very powerful lemon taste, not much peach for the taste, but a very powerful peach smell.
This was the first sour I had from Cory, and it has changed my perspective of what a sour can be. Looking forward to what else he is is making. 301 characterswillis870ace, Jun 28, 2014

Cory from Side Project is an absolute beer artist and a really good dude. It pours a peach color with a slight haze and a bit of white head bubbles. Aroma is awesome, sour scent with hints of peach. The taste is perfectly balanced with quite a bit of puckering sour that finishes with a very refreshing flavor of fresh peaches. Hard to believe this beer isn't higher on the ratings. Definitely one of the best I've ever had. 537 charactersDawgboned37, Jun 15, 2014

4.35/5  rDev -5.2%look: 3.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4375ml bottle poured into a Side Project Wine Glass, enjoyed on 6.7.14, reviewed from Tasting Journal.
The beer pours a soft pineapple, champagne-like color, hazy and cloudy with a fizzy, white head that has low retention and yields a few spots of lace. The aroma is a masterclass, soft peach at first, definitely get the acetic sour qualities but as the beer warms and opens up, the peach because spectacular, the "fuzzy" peach skin becomes so pronounced and prominent along with the juiciness of the fruit, it really is something special and truly incredible, perhaps the truest expression of peach, or any fruit for that matter, I've ever encountered in a wild ale or lambic. The flavors however, fail to live up the aroma, juicy peach, that quickly turns sour, very acetic, light tartness with some nice funkiness, pale grain is more detectable along with some oak and white grape. The balance is less nuanced, much of the focus is on the sourness and acetic qualities rather than the fruity peach flavors, and while I definitely enjoyed sipping on this, it never really opened up. The mouthfeel is nice, fizzy, lively, coats the mouth well and finishes somewhat easily with a bit of a crisp bite.
Verdict: A very nice American Wild from Side Project and the peach character in the aroma is world class. However, the overly sour flavors and lack of established balance really brought this one back down to earth. Not sure that time will help this cause, but hopefully it's all part of the learning curve for Side Project and that their future wilds will find some more balance amongst the base beer, the adjuncts and the cultures. 1,635 characterskevanb, Jun 13, 2014

The peach is right up front, after a nice burst of carbonation. Sour aftertaste, for sure. Really enjoying this. Straight up tart peach juice with some funk and wine added. I love it. 459 charactersMikeypnh, Jun 11, 2014

Little bit of a gusher. Pours a light yellow color with a small head. Just a real small rim of head left. Smell is amazing. Almost like a peach was cut in half and had a tiny bit of funk added to it. Taste is even more over the top with peaches. Like sour peach juice. Mouthfeel is light and airy. Refreshing!! Overall this is an amazing beer. 356 charactersNHbeerguy, Jun 11, 2014

Big thanks to dujayhawk for sending this one down! Reviewed from notes. Poured from 375 mL bottle into a Tampa Bay Brewing Company snifter.
A: Pours a hazy light gold, with a thin white head and medium visible carbonation.
S: Big funk, barnyard and horseblanket, less stone fruit, and some lactic tartness. Mild vinous character as it opens up during the drink.
T: Funky tartness, lactic acid, an incredibly natural peach flavor. Some barnyard, milder barrel tannins, hints of the white wine. Nicely attenuated light malts, and puckeringly dry funky tartness. Finishes with some lingering stone fruit and bone dryness.
M: Light body, good carbonation sensation, and an alcohol content that is VERY well-hidden for the listed ABV.
O: This was really, truly, very good. Drinkable, but maintains the tart, funk and fruit that you're looking for. I truly don't know if it would be worth what it seems to be trading for, especially since it disappears from your glass before you realize it's gone. But it's really yummy. 1,043 charactersmacrosmatic, Jun 10, 2014

This was drank after BA Abraxas VB Assassin and KBBS, so it was refreshing to cleanse the palate with something sour!
A - Appearance makes this beer look so appetizing, especially with this 85 degree weather. Lots of carb on this beer and pours a golden pale color with a 3 finger white foam head.
S - Smell is lots of peach with the smell of tartness behind it. I am somewhat inexperienced but this sour smells fantastic. White peach sour funky smell going on here but not much funk.
T - Taste follows the nose with the huge tart upfront that doesn't last too long. The finish is all peaches and goodness. If you like peaches you will in turn love this sour. Definitely acidic tart up front but a nice finish.
M - Lots of carbonation here that works well for this beer. Again don't have too much to compare too but this is light and easy drinking.
O - An awesome sour poured directly from Cory himself into a glass. This is a fantastic sour and is right up there with MvB and Atrial Batch 1(my favorite of the 3)

Landed this and a couple other bottles with the help of my buddy, Joe. Opened our small share with this gem, hoping to get every flavor possible before fatiguing our palates with other beers. Poured from a 375 ml bottle into a Voodoo Barrel Room tasting snifter.
A- Carbonation on this beer is evident from the get-go. Foam started pushing towards the top of the bottle once it was opened. Not a gusher, but it is well carbonated. Poured a few ounces with a thin, white head. Cloudy, pale, straw color. This beers leaves some traces on the glass. Looks like I what I imagined a peachy wild ale would.
S- Peachy-freaking-funk. You can tell from the aroma that this will be sour. Not overly funky like a Cantillon, but this certainly has some funk character to it. Throw ripe peaches into the mix, and you have a lovely bouquet.
T- Punches you in the mouth with a boldy, yet lovely, lemony, acidic, sour right hook. Then, it caresses your mouth with sweet and slightly tart peaches. Authentic peaches, at that. This isn't peach flavoring, but firm, juicy, peachy delight. The flavors come in waves, and boy, is it a rush. Fantastic.
M- As mentioned above, there is a good amount of carbonation on this beer, but it doesn't detract from it. It actually compliments the sourness quite well. No trace of the 8% ABV. Lingering sourness on the lips and tongue. 
O- This beer lived up to the hype, and I'm so glad to have been able to try it. It delivers on the peach and sour flavors, without question, even adding an element of funkiness that makes it just a little more diverse. Great beer, and I have to give a HUGE thanks to Dan for hooking me up. He knows what beer advocacy is all about. Cheers! 1,749 charactersjbwimer, May 21, 2014

Pours very little head that dissipates quickly. Spotty lace with little cling. Beer is a slightly cloudy lemon. Average.
Nose is tart peach, light funk, cobwebs and a touch of wood. Crisp and accented.
Opens super tart peach. Very fruit forward. Sweet and tart in the middle with notes of peach flesh and skin. Funky towards the end but the sour never subsides. Peach skin aftertaste. Solid but pretty one dimensional. Very in your face. 
Light bodied with moderate carbonation. Filmy and puckering in the mouth and dry going down. Dry finish with a lingering aftertaste that really coats the palate. Really drinkable.
A very solid beer overall but not close to deserving of the perfect score it gets. Look and nose are pretty average although this is quite tasty and drinkable. 843 charactersSpeedwayJim, May 15, 2014

The peach is front and center and steals the show The taste is nice and tart up front with a quick segue to juicy peach notes. Lots of interplay between acidic tartness and juicy sweetness. The finish and after taste are where this beer shines. The perfect balance of sweetness and tartness with a little bit lingering from the wine notes. The taste outdoes the nose by a bit. Mouthfeel is well carbonated and with light body. The 8% is completely hidden in this gem of a beer. Overall, this is a fantastic beer with damn near perfect balance and a great showcase of the peach. 767 charactershomebrew311, May 11, 2014

Appearance: Pale hazy light yellow, with a white fluffy head that disappears relatively quickly but leaves behind some lacing and a thin creamy crown.
Smell: Holy shit. Dried peaches and creamy coconut. Peaches on peaches on peaches on peaches. Peach pit, peach flesh, peach skin. Peach in every way you could imagine. The coconut flavor is sweet and creamy and accents nicely with the gorgeous peach. Did I mention peach?
Taste: Lots of lactic sour (mouthpuckeringly sour really, it really hits you square in the jaw), with peach playing a little bit second fiddle to the just overall sour of the beer. Perhaps a bit of funk. Not particularly complex, but that’s fine because I love everything that is happening in my mouth right now.
Mouthfeel: Friggin amazing. High carb but far from too much. Absolutely perfect. Very crisp. Lingers a while on the lactic sour flavor.
Overall: I can taste that this is made with white peaches instead of yellow peaches. They’re sweeter, have a slightly different flavor profile, and make this a really unique and delicious beer. Side Project can do no wrong. 1,177 charactersWTKeene, May 08, 2014

A: Bright opaque orange/yellow/gold. I suppose you could say peach colored. Bright white 1 finger head on pour that recedes to a ring of white bubbles around the edges of the surface.
S: Peaches and funk.
T: Pretty darn sour, but not overly so. Funky peaches and I get apricots too. Reminds me of Almanac Valley of the Hearts Delight but not quite as sour, which is a good thing IMO.

A- Hazy straw-yellow body, one finger white head, good retention, some lacing. Looks quite well carbonated.
S- Vinegar, tart stone fruits, oak, even a bit of barnyard at the end. It's wave after wave of sour, peaches and funk. Wonderful.
F- It starts out with a nice non-descript vinegar sourness, 6/10 as it is not explosively so, but nice enough to make my parotids shiver. The peach flavours come next; a nice and tart peach juice that starts contributing a sweetness that helps balance out the vinegar. There is tons more peach character in this than Peche 'n Brett. And then the finish is a dry oak and Brettanomyces. Musty and oaky dry finish. Wonderful flavour profile that makes me wish all peach sours could be like this.
M- Medium bodied, but light on the tongue and effervescent. Very refreshing tartness results from the vinegar and peaches, leaving a dry oaky finish. So drinkable, if I had a 375ml of my own, I'd easily drink this by myself without getting any heartburn.
O- Excellent peach sour. No beer is worth what people are having to offer up to get this one, but it does speak to Cory King's expertise in brewing and blending wild ales and saisons together. This is one of the best examples of the American Wild Ale genre I've come across, and certainly the best fruited one. Yes, I think this is just as good, if not better than Very Sour Blackberry. 1,505 charactersStevedore, Apr 27, 2014

S- Fruity, sour, and funky all in one big assault on the nostrils. Starts off with an acidic, lambic-like tart and sour scents. Then the smell turns towards a fruity, peach flavor that is extremely juicy and fairly tart. The peach flavor in the scent is the dominant scent until the end when a funkiness kicks in and provides a slight musty scent.
T- Starts off with a big, wild ale sour attack on the taste buds. Sourness is very lambic/gueuze like in nature before the tartness moves more toward a fruit-focus. Peach flavor is in there underneath the fruity-sour flavor in the middle of the drink. Peach flavor lingers a bit as a drier and funkier flavor kicks in. The flavors toward the end of the drink lean toward a musty focus, just like the scent, but still contain a moderate to strong level of tart and acidic flavors.
M- Thick and smooth, despite having a fairly high level of carbonation. This beer is very sour, yet refreshing, largely due to the fruity nature of some of the tartness and highly carbonated nature of the beer. The only limiting factor in ability to drink this all day is whether or not your can stand the level of tartness.
Overall, Cory does it again. This beer has a great mix of sour, fruit, and funk, yet I would say it is not among the more complex of Cory's beers. On the whole, this beer is a great fruited sour. 1,575 charactersboilermakerbrew, Apr 25, 2014

The nose is distinctly peachy upfront with layers of funk and barrel notes fizzing up through the beer's calm surface. The flavor is also potently peachy, but is followed up by grain and a lingering vinous oak. This beer certainly doesn't hold back on the organic acids, which only serves to amplify this beer's juiciness (not for the sour novice). Aside from 18 months of penetrating acidity putting in work on a generally abused oral cavity, this beer's mouthfeel is light and effervescent, mildly sweet and grainy, and has a slightly tannic bitterness. This beer is worthy of praise, drinkable on release, and an excellent addition to the side project portfolio. 869 charactersThePorterSorter, Apr 20, 2014

4.96/5  rDev +8.1%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5Bought a pour at the release day. Poured from a 375ml bottle.
A- poured a golden yellow with little head, settles beautifully.
S- reminds me of a warhead from when I was little. Sour but with hints of peaches.
T- Very sour at first comparable to Sang Noir in tartness but lightens up and the peach notes come through wonderfully with dry wine and a hint of oak notes at the finish.
M- very light, goes down smooth and with no objections.
Overall this is one of the best sours, and more complex beers, I have had and easily ranks near the top of my list, which includes several Cascade beers, Almanac, and the sisters from GI. Try it if you can get your hands on it. Glad to have traded my bottles to friends for them to enjoy and experience. 743 charactersJared14, Apr 20, 2014

Pours a nice pale golden straw color with some fuzzy haze to it. Light thin white head tries to rise but fades to a thin ring around the edge of the glass.
Aroma is marvelous!! Wow. Notes of sweet peach followed by exquisite peach skin and un-ripened peach tartness. This fruit punch is then followed by more earthy and citric yeast tartness. The tartness seems somewhat mild in the nose but enticing and indicative of some great wild yeast and bacteria. Fresh peach juice creeps up again with a nice woody and clean finish near the end of the bouqette. 
Wow! This is so complex for a fruit sour. Starts off with strong notes of peach skin and un-ripe peach pulp. There is tartness and some mild sweetness that mingles together to give a very fruit forward intro. After this intro a sharper more citric yet measured pop of acidic tartness creeps up. Clean and sharp. Lingering residual tartness stays with you yearning for more sips. Very clean finish with a great clean and crisp carbonation. Light and fluffy mouthfeel with a dry woody finish. Overall, I am a bigger fan of Cory’s sasions but this is an exquisite, excellent and near perfect fruit wild ale. The fruit notes are nuanced but retain their importance and are not overly dominated by the bacteria. An excellent beer. 1,351 charactersJoEBoBpr, Apr 18, 2014

Pours a golden yellow color, light eggshell head, thin ring around the glass and some wisps on top. Nose is peaches...not just peaches, but the most amazing peach note I've ever smelled in a beer, no doubt. Along with the fresh peaches, there's a nice tart citrus acidity, oak, nice funkiness. Flavor is the perfect mix of tartness from the sour base with the most insane natural peach note I've ever tasted. The barrel charter is light, good acidity without being over-the-top. Light body, soft carbonation that's just right, dry finish.
Probably the best American Wild I've had in a couple of years and better than Yellow Bus (when it was fresh). Basically, the best peach-based sour I've ever had and definitely the most memorable beer I've had so far in 2014. Great work, Cory...believe the hype. 860 charactersSean9689, Apr 17, 2014

T: Great balanced sour, peach is forward note, but not over powering. Crisp flavors with a subtle tart finish.
S: Peach, sour apple, even a little orange. Very citrus-y nose.
A very light amber color. 260 charactersgeimerman, Dec 06, 2013

Score: 98
2014 vintage bottle served in a wine chalice and enjoyed on 04/19/14 at the Fuzzy release. Review is from iPhone notes.
Appearance: Pours a translucent golden color with a half finger of white head that settles to a nice almost full coating layer. Excellent lacing and retention. 4.5/5
Smell: Peach, peach, peach, peach and more peach. A little must and vinegar too. Smells like the lastest batch of Duck Duck Gooze with a truckload of peaches added. 4.75/5
Taste: Tart peaches, vinegar and a light mustiness. Long lasting sour peach flavor. Lively on the gums from the tartness. A kiss of spritzy, tannic oak. Really simple, but really delicious. A bit of mineral water-like robustness to the taste, a la Cantillon or Drie Fonteinen. This beer tastes an awful lot like Duck Duck Gooze heavily spiked with peaches. Having drank a few pours that day, we found that the dregs of this beer was the key to its greatness. Make sure that you either aggravate the sediment in the bottle before pouring or grab one of the last pours from the bottle (if sharing). 5/5
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, spot on carbonation for the flavor profile. Juicy mouthfeel, dry finish. Quite tart. Acidic, but not stomach ache inducingly so. 4.75/5
Overall: One thing I absolutely love about this beer is how sour and peach-forward on the flavor it is. Many peach-forward sours are lightly tart and delicate/soft on the palate, where as this one is bold, tart and long lasting flavor-wise. While not as good as Very Sour Blackberry or Blueberry Flanders in my opinion, this is one of the better American-made sours out there, on par with the likes of West Ashley. Seek this one out with confidence, and make sure to savor the dregs.
Cost: $15 for a 375 ml bottle. 1,823 charactersjegross2, Nov 28, 2013

Webby surface skim breaks after the first sip.
Initial aroma of fruit tree leaves and woody stems, underripe peach fruit as it warms up.
A light trace acid present also, but very clean and fruit forward.
Puckering sourness, fairly intense, finishes bone dry and crisp.
Peach is the dominant flavor, not much oak or background nuance, but it's nice.
Juicy peach flesh clinging to the pit. Fruit forward and moderately sour, not that funky.
Nice to try a bottle of this after having it at fests a couple times.
Thanks to Steve for this one! 610 charactersemerge077, Nov 18, 2013
