4.22/5  rDev -7.3%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4The first sip of this beer sort of blew me away. It has intense bourbon character and a ton of dark fruit. I couldn't drink much of it because it was so intensely sweet and boozy. The experience wore on me as it went on and each sip seemed less enjoyable than the last until it warmed and the flavor profile offered more vanilla and chocolate notes. The coffee is definitely there, but you wouldn't think it was included as an adjunct. This is still a very good beer. I wanted to drink this before the coffee faded, but if you're holding a bottle don't worry if you don't get around to opening it for a while. Given the amazing bourbon notes and the booze, this can only improve with age. 688 charactersdanh53, Apr 05, 2017

This one pours a pretty dark black, with a small to non-existent head, and no lacing.
Smells like roasty and nutty coffee, cookie dough, oak, earthy vanilla, graham cracker, and light bourbon.
It's not surprising that this is pretty incredible. There's a lot going here. There's the classic dusty but vibrant FW barrel profile, light barrel spice, oak, and earthy vanilla, with bitter and nutty coffee- roasty and very fresh tasting. There's still a good amount of roasty character here, some light smoke, graham cracker breadiness, and very dark bitter chocolate. There's only a small hint of bourbon but it rounds it out pretty well.
Like most of FW's barrel aged beers, this is not incredibly thick, but it's just the right consistency to give it a perfectly drinkable body.
This is absolutely wonderful. One of this brewery's best. 883 charactersGreesyFizeek, Apr 02, 2017

4.16/5  rDev -8.6%look: 4.25 | smell: 2.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Traditional hue, mild carbonation on the pour settles into a pencil thin barm. Aroma was dissapointing to me - perhaps it has sit too long, but there is very little coffee aroma beyond a extremely faint nutty espresso note, and it doesn't compensate with any additional bouquets. A little bourbon wood / vanilla / caramel but you really have to strain for it, and there is a vegatal note floating around in there too.
Palate is more expressive thankfully, though still lacking in distinction. Upfront is a gentle espresso with nutty qualities, and the mid-palate brings some classic FW barrel notes (vanilla, baker's chocolate) and a kiss of bourbon heat. The espresso loses its identity a little once those heftier flavors assert themselves but it is still there as a nice cushion. In a sense I appreciate the beer's subtlety in a world of in-your-face, more-is-more beers, but I just feel like it is lacking a certain crescendo to make it a top-tier brew. That said, it is still an excellent beer and one that has nuances to relish instead of punching you in the face with coffee. 1,083 charactersajm5108, Mar 06, 2017

Pours nearly opaque dark brown/black color with a 1-2 finger dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a light amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of huge nutty dark roast coffee, dark chocolate, cocoa, caramel, toffee, molasses, fudge, vanilla, cream, toasted oak, bourbon, and dark bread; with lighter notes of dark fruit, smoke, charcoal, leather, and roast/oak/toasted earthiness. Touch of booze in the aromas as it warms, but really minimal. Incredible aromas with amazing balance and complexity of dark/roast/bready malt, coffee, and bourbon barrel notes; with great strength. Taste of huge nutty dark roast coffee, dark chocolate, cocoa, caramel, toffee, molasses, fudge, vanilla, cream, toasted oak, bourbon, and dark bread; with lighter notes of dark fruit, smoke, charcoal, leather, and roast/oak/toasted earthiness. Moderate roast/char bitterness and bourbon/oak spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of nutty coffee, dark chocolate, cocoa, caramel, toffee, molasses, fudge, vanilla, cream, toasted oak, bourbon, dark bread, light dark fruit/smoke, and roast/oak/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt, coffee, and bourbon barrel flavors; with a great roasted bitter/sweet and bourbon/oak spiciness balance; with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light dryness from roast bitterness and oak spiciness, lightly increasing through the glass. Light-medium carbonation and fairly full body; with a very smooth, creamy/silky, and fairly sticky/chalky/tannic balanced mouthfeel that is awesome. Alcohol is very well hidden; a small pleasant warmth lingers after the finish, with minimal barrel booziness. Overall this is an insane BBA imperial coffee stout! All around incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt, coffee, and bourbon barrel flavors; very smooth and dangerously easy to sip on for the huge ABV. The balance of malt, coffee, and barrel flavors is pretty much perfect; with some nice underlying complexity from the age of the bottle. This felt far more aromatic and less boozy than the base beer when I originally had it. A highly amazing offering all around. 2,376 characterssuperspak, Jan 19, 2017

S: a nice blend of coffee and bourbon. The coffee is bright and fruity vs dark and rich coffee.  Smooth bourbon, nice aroma, but not too robust.
T: much like the aroma, fruity/lighter coffee, smooth bourbon. It's lacking chocolate richness.
F: smooth but fairly thin. It's highly carbonated with tingly bubbles...not my preference in ba stouts.

T - also big coffee, bourbon, oak up front, vanilla, milk chocolate, dark chocolate, then molasses, caramel, wholesome/umami flavor, toasted coconut
M - big thick, heavy beer, alcohol completely covered at 13%, aftertaste is coffee, bourbon, vanilla, milk chocolate. 
O - great beer. Only two coffee bba impy stouts make my best beers of all time list - parabajava and kbs. The rest ive tried including NH Dragons Milk w coffee and chocolate and Avery Tweak just arent that good. Parabajava and Parabola are about the same to me, theyre just different sub-styles of the same style -> basically both 5/5 beer to me. 788 charactersHopHunter19, Nov 25, 2016

4.46/5  rDev -2%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5650ml bottle, 2016 release. Served in a snifter glass. Pours a dark brown body, nearly black, opaque with a nice bubbly one finger offwhite head, good retention, even a bit of lacing. Smells of rich bourbon, chocolate, brownies, fair bit of espresso, vanillin, oak. This is a very impressive aroma; the coffee doesn't seem to come across as strongly as say, BCBCS, but it seems to play more of a complementary role here. Flavour is similar; the coffee is there but it's not overpowering, it adds to the complexity of the base Parabola with plenty of brownies, milk chocolate, oak, touch of leather, vanillin, even a touch of bitter, earthy dark chocolate. Mouthfeel is medium-fuller bodied, creamy with good carbonation and solid effervescence. Overall, a nice complex dessert beer with a touch of espresso. It's not a huge coffee bomb, be forewarned, but you aren't going to miss that too much if you enjoy the base Parabola. 926 charactersStevedore, Nov 16, 2016

Smell: Rich dark chocolate, dates, fig jam, vanilla, cold brew coffee, bourbon, and a toffee sweet note. Thick and heavy on the nose. 
Taste: Decadent brownie batter soaked in bourbon. Notes of undiluted cold brewed coffee, vanilla, a smoky bourbon, lightly bitter roasted malt, and some dark pitted fruit notes. 
Feel: Viscous and heavy. This beer moves like molasses across the palate slowly coating every inch. Booze is present in a slight heat on the throat and warming in the chest. 
Overall: Brilliant. Bourbon soaked brownie batter is the best way to explain it only improved with coffee. The amount of intense flavors that layer on top of each other is incredible. Especially how they all play their part with none becoming overwhelming. The coffee is a brilliant edition that shines through perfectly to compliment the base beer.

Pours almost entirely black, with a dark brown ember hint to it, when hold against the light. Got a very nice, one finger broad, bubbly, light brown colored head.
Appears very sweet on the nose with lots of fudge and rock sugar, together with a roasted, earthy coffee bean aroma, like you'll get from an Espresso. The barrel does not appear overly pungent on the nose, while it certainly adds a gentle, oaken spiciness, enhancing the milk chocolate richness on the nose quite a bit. The coffee got a nice blueberry nuance to it, which adds an unexpected, well fitting twist to the nose.
Has a supersmooth, thick mouthfeel. Utmost enjoyable with a warm, spicy ending, revealing the full body of the beer in a challenging, enjoyable way. 
Tastes of Bourbon soaked chocolate fudge, wrapped up by spicy oak and earth. Coffee adds a scorched roast profile to silk, creamy milk chocolate, with a flowery sweet rock sugar quality to it. Got a spicy mid palate, defined by the warming, yet smooth appearing Bourbon, together with toasty, nutty coffee and lots of whipped cream. Finishes with bitter chocolate, dry coffee, which develops a noble hop leaf quality, a soft Bourbon tickle and sugared whipped cream.
Awesomly complex, decadent huge, with a convincing base beer, receiving further complexity from the barrel as well as from the coffee. Firestone Walker seems to never disappoint, this is just extremely well put together, making use of the coffee to counter the sweetness from the barrel. Bourbon in this is huge, almost sharp, with a great spiciness, adding to the beer in an uncomprimising way, while the brew itself is bold enough to take it. 1,668 charactersaleigator, Oct 02, 2016

4.6/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5The big question on everyone's mind going into the Parabajava tasting was how this coffee infused version of Parabola would compare to its regular, non-adjunct barrel aged version. 
The answer is simple: Parabajava tastes better, but only marginally. 
Take everything you like about Parabola, add a touch of coffee flavor to round out the flavor, subtract a little bit of heat from the alcohol and balance it out with a mild chili peppper presence, and finish clean and smooth like every bottle (or box or draft) of Parabola you have ever had. 
Certainly an enjoyable beer but not worth the extra effort to try and acquire it when Parabola is regularly available. 666 charactersrodmanfor3, Aug 31, 2016

The beer pours a blackish brown color with excellent head retention, and very fine, almost creamy lacing.   This beer looks spectacular (but then what would you expect?).  On the nose, this really is just a coffee version of Parabola.  It has all the same characteristics of the regular parabola (milk chocolate by the boat load, vanilla, bourbon and milk duds), but with a huge coffee presence as well.  The flavor profile replicates the nose in this rich, sweet, impressive BA stout.  The coffee tended to drown out the bourbon and sweetness somewhat, but it still wasn't at all overwhelming.  Mouthfeel was very full, and like the regular parabola, the beer was long, fairly soft, and very smooth on the palate.  Parabajava seemed to be a bit less boozy than parabola, but this is still a big beer.
Excellent stuff, obviously. 861 charactersJohn_M, Jul 24, 2016

L - deep deep brown, but not motor oil black like I was expecting.  Very little foam head around the edges, and with a few sips it disappears and you're just left with deep brown.
S - nice bourbon note, deep roasted malts like a solid BA imperial stout.  Having said that, not much coffee present.  Even less so as the beer warmed.
T - Quite delicious.  Coffee is present but not as much upfront.  It's more present as a subtle note.  There's no question this already takes an awesome beer like Parabola and adds another layer of complexity.
F - A bit of heat.  Bourbon note is present at end but not overpowering.  
O - A high end stout.  Possibly the best one from FW BA program.  I would drink this much more frequently if I could get my hands on it.  It will not disappoint. 817 characterseifster82, May 27, 2016

The beer is smooth as can be but I have to say I  expected more coffee from this beer.  The coffee is there but its subtle.  The flavor and the scent come through a bit more as it warms up.  Comparatively BCBCS was more slightly more viscous and was a bit more peppery.    Both were fantastic brews and I'm not sure one beer was better than the other.  Overall I wish I would have tried Parabajava sooner to see if more of the coffee came through.  I hope FW makes this a regular release. 593 charactersT_Hass, Apr 24, 2016

A: coffee forward, with rich complex deep grain roast and malt. The roast is reminiscent of coffee and dark chocolate. With the addition of actual coffee, even more so than standard Parabola. There is a light malt sweetness and bourbon barrel presence.  
A: Jet black color, totally opaque with a moderate tan mostly-smooth head that has adequate retention.
T: Moderate coffee flavor upfront that quickly moves into deep grain roast. The malt flavor is coffee/dark chocolate-like with a slight sweetness. The beer has a slight bourbon barrel character with a dry finish. 
M: Full bodied with moderate carbonation. The beer has a luscious texture, slight alcoholic warmth, and is unbelievably smooth. 
O: Delicious; Parabola is a world class Russian Imperial Stout and the coffee variant brings out even more coffee aroma and flavor. Another interesting aspect of this variant is that it’s smoother than standard Parabola. Slightly over-carbonated, but all in all the coffee really integrates well in this beer, highly drinkable and delicious! 1,057 charactersPhil-Fresh, Apr 18, 2016

4.66/5  rDev +2.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75First off, let me say that this beer is fabulous.
Smells like fresh coffee grounds, hints of wood and coca.  Flavor is all coffee shop mocha lattes with some oak toast thrown in for depth of character. Mouthfeel and finish is typical of FW BA beers (Parabola, Sucaba, Stickee Monkee, Velvet Merkin, Helldorado, etc)  I have come to expect a level of finesse in their execution of these beers. 
Finally, let me say that, while this beer is fabulous, it is not worth the crazy hype. A tremendous beer that will definitely be brewed again, I shouldn't wonder. 558 charactersRothobinide, Apr 04, 2016

This beer looks very light when it is being poured, but looks almost black in the glass. Head is 1/4 inch and mocha colored. Retention is almost non existent and there is no lacing. Smell is very complex. Chocolate, oak, coffee, vanilla and bourbon are most apparent. Taste is very similar. Absolutely outstanding. Initially the beer is very very chocolatey and although not "hot," kind of heavy on the bourbon too. As it warms though the coffee really emerges and the bourbon takes a back seat. Feel is full and velvety. Slightly sticky on the back end. Overall just fantastic! Based on taste alone this is the best stout I've ever had. According to my BA ratings I like Parabajava .03 more than Parabola. 787 charactersCNoj012, Mar 31, 2016

Pours a deep brown, nearly black body with a light brown or dark tan head that reduces at a moderate rate, after 10 minutes it leaves a ring of retention and some spotty lacing. 
On the nose is heavy bourbon and vanilla, much like Parabola. Milk chocolate and maybe a little coffee, but not too much coffee. A little boozy in this category as well. 
So.. letting this warm up to almost room temperature makes it a totally different beer! Cold, it's very whiskey forward with vanilla and milk chocolate. As it warms up, the coffee really starts shining through, especially on the follow through and finish. Aftertaste is very roasty, toasty, charred. A little boozy, but that's expected. Mouthfeel is pretty rich and thick, medium-heavy body with low carbonation. 
Very good.. I found this VERY similar to Parabola until it warmed up, at which time the coffee really started shining. 985 charactersgcamparone, Mar 22, 2016

From a bomber into a snifter
Vintage: 2015
Imperial Coffee Stout
APPEARANCE: A very transparent dark brown pour yields a two finger, medium looking, creamy, light brown head with good retention. Clear bistre brown body with and absolute shit ton of carbonation. Bubbles all over this place. Absurd for the style, really. Head fades to a thick cap and clings to the sides of the glass. A splotchy wisp remains leaving traces of lacing down the glass. Really light in color for an imperial stout and way over carbonated. 
SMELL: Raw coffee beans, oak, some light bourbon, and traces of sweet cream and roasted notes. Definitely raw bean forward. Very heavy on the coffee beans. 
TASTE: Lots of raw coffee beans a gain, with notes of oak and bourbon up front. Some alcohol with more wood and bourbon at the swallow, then a bold and lingering finish of oak, sweet cream, some bourbon and toffee sweetness, and lots of raw, bitter and burnt coffee beans. Pretty outspoken. 
PALATE: Medium body and medium levels of carbonation. Creamy smooth on the palate, goes down fine with a burn at the swallow and finishes a bit sticky. Some heat definitely lingers as well. 
OVERALL: This was good stuff. Not as mind numbing as everyone says it is, but it's certainly high quality. The coffee is very forward and rather raw, for lack of a better word, though the barrel still pokes through here and there. The one real knock I'd give it is that the color is simply too light and transparent for the style. I don't remember earlier batches of Parabola being like this. It's also insanely carbonated, which is odd. Anyways, a solid beer that was fun to drink, though I'm not sure I'd pick it over the regular Parabola, as I found the coffee addition a little too beany, if that makes any sense. Give it a try if you see it though. Definitely worth checking out and FW never disappoints. Cheers vanlingleipa! 1,954 charactersJeffo, Mar 19, 2016

I equate it to that first sip of one of those legendary batches of bcbcs (like fresh 13 and 11).  Firestone walker really owns barrel aging beer in my mind and the addition of the selected coffee to parabola is simply magic. looking forward to this being an annual release and hopefully getting a little easier to get. homerun! 578 characterscosmicevan, Mar 18, 2016

4.62/5  rDev +1.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75On tap in Buellton and what a friggin' treat. 3oz pour (times about 6-7) and looked a bit thin, aroma was that fudge and coffee, some bourbon and chocolate. All the flavors mended together so well and this is such an incredible beer that I personally didn't think I'd enjoy so much. DESTROYS BCBCS and certainly (IMO) better than regular Parabola by a mile. For a 14% monster stout, this is near the top of the list and happy some were just put on the shelf as we were leaving. 477 charactersEyePeeAyBryan, Mar 10, 2016

3.56/5  rDev -21.8%look: 3.75 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5On tap at the barrelhouse.  Pours out looking a little lighter than Parabola, but still ultra dark.  Head isn't as luxurious either.  Aroma was a big disappointment, I expected way more coffee, this was one I was kind of thinking maybe my nose wasn't working, but the hoppy stuff smelled hoppy, so i didn't think it was on me.
Taste, the bitterness is higher and the barrel notes are lower, the coffee flavor is just not jumping for me.  Still thick, good viscosity, roast, but at the expense of the oak, bourbon and whatnot.
I dunno, this was one I thought that was clearly a lesser compared to the base version. 615 charactersrodbeermunch, Mar 06, 2016

Smell is coffee and a little roasty, some chocolate.
Taste is coffee, moderate, not overwhelming or strong.
Mouthfeel is moderate, thinner than expected.
Overall I'm not sold. The hype train left the station before I tried this and I don't see it. It's a solid if unspectacular beer. I get to drink Fremont Coffee KDS on the regular and there is NO comparison. FW is good but can't stand up. Nice beer though. 4.25/5 for me. 497 charactersjtirpak22, Feb 14, 2016

This is really nice. A bit of bourbon barrel heat that muddles the flavors a bit, but probably the only flaw I noticed. It's very smooth considering it's at 14% abv. Overall, doesn't beat my personal best barrel-aged coffee stout (BA Vietnamese Speedway), but better than BCBCS and Eclipse Vanilla Java, which is pretty damn impressive. 420 charactersRollzroyce21, Feb 12, 2016

Against BCBCS, this paled in comparison, although still being an wonderful extension of a wonderfully executed base bourbon barrel aged imperial stout. 408 charactersdar482, Jan 15, 2016

Looks like a stout.   Bit more foam and head than a lot of barrel aged stouts.
Huge coffee and chocolate smell.  Barrel is hidden.  Quite good.  A bit of a step below the mocha Wednesday.
All coffee and chocolate in the taste with a very smooth mouthfeel.  Maybe a little barrel?  Really freaking good.

Color is a brown that is near black, with an oily shine to it, pours a half finger of brown head that quickly settles into a thin ring of lacing.
Smell-Lots of coffee, with hints of oak, vanilla, cocoa, and dark fruit, some booze is definitely there on this one.
Taste-Roasted malt flavors of cake, dark fruit, brown sugar and cocoa are there but subtle, the flavor is dominated by strong coffee, there is a better kick that somewhat compliments the sweet malt notes, sigh bit of booze.
Feel-Full bodied and pretty oily, identical texture to Parabola IMO.
Overall-Really tasty beer, i think i prefer Parabola but this did it justice as an interesting variation. 711 charactersSteveB24, Jan 03, 2016

Incredible aroma: coffee and bourbon, oak and chocolate, vanilla and ... more coffee.
Impressively smooth. This ranks amongst FW's most perfectly integrated and balanced brews. Chocolate, espresso, and smooth, sweet bourbon. Nutty and roasty. Almost wine-like finish from the barrel.
Mouthfeel is just as impressive. Way too drinkable for 14%. Just a touch of heat on the back end. Thick.
From the first sip, this is a BA brew that can truly rival GI's BC series. Superb; almost too rich. 548 charactersRoguer, Dec 26, 2015

Pours an almost opaque super dark orange-brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Tiny dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa powder, coffee bean, brewed coffee, and cream aromas. Taste is much the same with coffee bean, brewed coffee, cream, cocoa powder, caramel, and toffee flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with a perfect creamy coffee smell and fantastic flavors. 
Serving type: bottle. 732 charactersUCLABrewN84, Dec 14, 2015

Pours jet black with a thin medium brown head. Not much lacing.
Nose is led off by a phenomenal fresh-brewed coffee aroma, which transitions to bourbon and dark chocolate. Tons of depth here, yet stays very balanced.  
Taste is just as good as the nose if not a bit better. Phenomenal mix of dark chocolate, bourbon, and coffee up front with hints of raisin, caramel, and oak. Between the base stout, barrel, and coffee, each component has a ton of depth but stays quite balanced. A bit too much alcohol heat on the finish is the only issue I can take with this beer - I'm guessing it will improve with age as the alcohol bite fades a bit.
Mouthfeel is full-bodied and smooth with low carbonation. Excellent.
Not that I expected anything less from the Barrelworks program, but this is truly a world-class beer. 884 charactersemyers, Nov 29, 2015

Look: noticeably lighter than Parabola (srm=117 rather than 167); small ring of tan foam.
Smell: straight fudge and coffee; almond extract. 
Taste: hot damn, that's delicious. Chocolate truffle, coffee, vanilla, coconut, mild bourbon, mild oak, with hints of tobacco and molasses.
Feel: chewy, without being a chore. Slightly dry, and shockingly little alcohol heat/burn. 
Overall: I think I've given maybe two other beers a 5 in taste before, but I had to do it here. This is just a magnificent beer. Given the utter lack of abrasive heat, and the coffee element, I don't think I'll wait longer than four months to finish my remaining bottles. Hard to imagine this getting better anyway. 758 charactersneurobot01, Nov 28, 2015

This beer is exactly what you would expect, black as night, this is a straight coffee bomb. Nice roasted coffee with subtle vanilla, bourbon, and other barrel goodness.

4.5/5  rDev -1.1%Appearance: (4.5) - Pours a jet black color with a light khaki head that fades quickly. Minimal lacing. Very viscous looking. Big beer
Aroma (4.25) - Lots of coffee roast on the first whiff. Underneath, some vanilla, cream, dark chocolate, dark fruit, and a hint of caramel. Just a hint of boozy bourbon.
Flavor (4.75) - Flavor is beautiful and hits all over the map. Big, nicely balanced flavor. Coffee is big but doesn't overshadow flavors of semi-sweet chocolate, cream, vanilla, dark fruit, and booze. Hint of booze on the finish with lingering coffee and chocolate. A subtle bitterness keeps tames the sweetness. Superb.
Mouthfeel (4.5) - Rich, thick mouthfeel. Moderate bitterness helps balance the sweet components of the beer. Finish is long and a bit boozy with lots of coffee and chocolate. Mouthfeel totally suits this beast of a beer.
Overall: Excellent beer. Maybe not an improvement upon regular Parabola, but a world-class BA coffee stout. 958 charactersjacewg, Aug 19, 2014

22oz bottle
Pours nice deep black with good head
Coffee dominates the nose but the barrel is not overshadowed.
Taste is AMAZING coffee comes through first then dark chocolate and hints of caramel. Not overly hot but you definitely get a solid barrel presence.
Overall another Amazing release from Firestone Walker. One of the most balanced bourbon coffee stouts. Its drinking great fresh and I can see this aging nicely. 446 charactersBG24, Apr 17, 2014

The appearance was very dark, basically black. It had a dark tan head. 
The smell was roasted espresso with Caramel sweetness and Bourbon. The taste was similar. 
Overall the best tasting coffee barrel aged stout I've ever had. 344 charactersbrenty0man, Jul 01, 2013
