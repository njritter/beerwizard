Midnight syrup black with almost no head.
Not much on the nose, could be my environment getting in the way. Some maple syrup and cocoa. As it warms I'm getting more of a nose. Sweet bourbon. Light nail polish. Scores adjusted.
Oh shit. This is incredible. Huge waves of bourbon, maple, and black licorice just invade the palate leaving syrup and booze behind. To say it's good is an understatement. The alcohol grows astringent but not for long as it turns to black jelly bean. 
Feel is huge, viscous, thick, syrupy...all the above.
I'm having a 2015 KBS side by side and CBS is to KBS what KBS is to FBS. A killer. 735 charactersThe-Adjunct-Hippie, Mar 20, 2017

5/5  rDev +8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I visited Founders yesterday with my wife and my buddy to drink the wonderful rare beers that Founders had tapped for their annual Cellar Raid.  Founders did not disappoint!  The highlight of the day full of highlights was the tapping of CBS.
Look - first glance of CBS was like many many other stouts that I have enjoyed in the past.  Founders served their 8 ounce pour of CBS in a snifter.  The beer had a slight head on it that quickly disappeared in a minute or two.
Smell - you taste with your smell first and I knew I was in for a special treat with CBS.  Coffee was the dominant note accented by the sweet maple and bourbon notes of the beer.  No detection of hops whatsoever.
Taste - I'm amazed that all the flavors in CBS seem to feed off one another.  I hope this makes sense but the final product ends up even better than the sum of its parts.  Just an exceptionally balanced imperial stout beer with the coffee, maple syrup, bourbon and chocolate.
Feel - phenomenal aftertaste that stays with you.  But it doesn't stay long because you want that next drink almost immediately.  Not too heavy, not too light with a slight chew.  And just carbonated enough to know it's there, but really, who cares?
Overall - this is a beer worthy of making special plans to drink.  You know a beer is special when it is introduced by parading the Canadian flag around the taproom while playing the Canadian national anthem.  CBS is definitely worthy of being on everyone's beer bucket list. 1,490 charactersarchiebunkerjr, Jan 29, 2017

Beautiful looking beer. Looks rich, gooey and still. La Brea Tar Pits in a glass. 
Smell and flavor show a sugary sweetness, roast and black licorice. I don't detect any coffee at this point really, though vanilla and some dark dry fruit may be residuals of that. 
Body is thinner than BCBS, but plenty gooey and sticky and with the sugary quality there's a distinct texture. Drinks easily. 425 charactersONovoMexicano, Dec 22, 2016

Won't go so far as to say it's the best stout I've had but it is in the running and deserves all the accolades it gets. Very smooth thick feeling beer with bourbon hitting your nose before notes of chocolate come into play. The flavor has bourbon, coffee, chocolate, and just a hint of maple.  Complex amazing stout, hope to get lucky enough again someday to have it again. 427 charactersMeyers1023, Dec 13, 2016

A: jet black, nice tan head and great lacing down the glass.
S: Lots of bourbon on the nose with more coffee and chocolate at the end.
T: Extremely smooth. Bourbon, coffee bitterness, some chocolate sweetness, and a little bit of maple. Wish there was more maple. But this stout is extremely well balanced. Compared to good morning its alot less sweet and more balanced. 
F: perfect, it's smooth, thick not sticky. Amazing
O: very smooth well balanced stout with some amazing flavors. 514 charactersGinjaSlice, Jun 08, 2016

2014 on tap for KBS release. 
I was expecting more maple favor but it mellowed with the age, so very smooth, drinkable coffee and chocolate sweetness with a subtle maple taste and still quite boozy. 245 charactersmattmarch, May 30, 2016

Pours jet black... like motor oil (as anticipated). You get a decent amount of chocolate with nice hints of the maple syrup. The roasted coffee flavors weren't as pronounced. There is definitely some underlying bourbon, oaky and vanilla flavors as well. Mouthfeel was a little thinner than I expected; low carbonation. Overall, this one definitely lived up to the hype for me! Cheers! 486 characterstregan_20, Apr 20, 2016

This elusive beer is worth seeking out.  I long for the day they release it in bottles again, although it may cause a few BAs to commit all sort of crimes to get their hands on a few to stash.  
It is sweet, playful, and after two tastings, I long for a third. 379 charactersiliketurtlesthx, Mar 31, 2016

What a great birthday surprise it was when Bruce pulled this out of his Tesco shopping bag (no, this beer isn’t sold in Tesco). Pours black-brown with a creamy, tan head. Sweet, dark malt nose, some chocolate. Big sweet flavor, dark sugar, chocolate cake, moderate roast. Full bodied with fine to average carbonation. Restrained warmth on the finish, very sweet and chocolatey, light maple notes, some wood. Lasting dark chocolate, dark sugar and baking cocoa. A powerful beer with an incredibly cohesive character. That’s really the strength of this beer, the fact that all elements seamlessly come together. I would say this beer is worthy of the almost universal acclaim it receives. I really hope to try this again sometime. Excellent. 793 charactersleighton, Mar 18, 2016

Appearance - Served up in an 8oz tulip with a thin layer of cocoa-colored head. The brew itself is black with cola brown edging. Lacing is mostly spotty with a few broken webs.
Smell - Chocolate and maple syrup. Lesser coffee roast. Underlying bourbon aroma.
Taste - Follows the nose. Chocolate and syrupy sweetness, adding up to a bit of a Hershey's chocolate syrup character. Lesser coffee roast comes through soon after, along with moderate molasses and maple flavors. Bourbon notes creep in near the end, adding notes of vanilla and oak. The aftertaste rings with a mild sweetness.
Mouthfeel - Full in body with low to moderate carbonation. Thick, sticky texture with a warm, drying finish.
Overall - This one definitely lives up to the hype. The thickness is a huge plus; many BBA stouts suffer from thinning out too much during the aging process, but this one holds true to a genuine impy body. Definitely one my favorite BBA brews I've had, and I look forward to trying it again when the opportunity arises. 1,094 charactersTheSixthRing, Mar 02, 2016

Nice black color with very small tan head
Smell is very sweet like candy and vanilla not as much coffee as BS or KBS
Taste is outstanding. The maple syrup and bourbon blend perfectly. There's not a ton of complexity but the handful of flavors that come through are perfectly balanced. Tastes like donuts or chocolate covered caramels. Very sweet from the syrup but not overly sweet at all. 
Hands down one of the best beers I have tried. Believe any and all hype 542 characterspbgnar, Feb 06, 2016

A: very dark brown, definitely not black. light brown frothy head. minimal lacing unfortunately. 
S: a lot of bourbon on the nose. not off putting, but very present. vanilla, chocolate, smoke, dark licorice, oak. 
T: chocolate, this is a very sweet brew. i assume that has something to do with the maple syrup which also has a presence. coffee notes in there as well. sweet brown sugar. alcohol is moderate and there is virtually no bitterness in this. 
M: body is full, but not throughout. manages to start very rich and tapers to a thinner than expected finish.

Feel: Fairly thick and coating but fades quickly. Really nice for the type and high abv.

A perfect stout.  If you ever get a chance to acquire it or have it on draft, do not pass on opportunity.  Dark black color, with a light layer of foam head upon pour.  The nose reminds of Breakfast Stout base but with more complexity with the maple coming through.  Taste is delicious and pleasant on the palate with, again, Breakfast Stout base being obvious but the maple sweetness note unmistakably coming through as it warms.  Shockingly smooth!  There is zero hint of booziness.  Just delicious with all the ingredients I look for in a stout, coffee, vanilla, chocolate, maple sweetness.  Phenomenal.  
I've had Rare, Prop 14, DL Coffee, and many other what I would consider high end stouts... but this takes the cake. 781 characterseifster82, Dec 31, 2015

Aroma is intense maple/chocolate/coffee in that order.  The maple smells so strong, makes for a sweet tooth boner. reminds me initially of Good Morning, but this smells richer and thicker.  Plenty to love about this smell, I'm ready for a sugar bomb!
Delicious, awesome bourbon vanilla balance.  Now the coffee comes through and its beautiful.. Every flavor incorporated in the making of this beer is felt in even the smallest sip.  There are no layers of different flavors here, everything is a pure mix and compliments itself. huge maple,coffee,rich chocolates, and bourbon sweetness to die for.  Some will probably knock the (I'm not going to call it thin because it's not) mouthfeel, because we all probably crave the molasses/chewy BCBS style. But this beer is so damn easy to drink, make sure to take your time and let it warm up.  Definitely an amazing beer, so awesomely crafted and balanced, very rich - just a pleasure to finally get my hands on a white whale like this.  Was at first sad to trade away one of my favorite beers to obtain it, but in the end it was worth the price. 1,222 charactersM_chav, Dec 24, 2015

Aroma was decadent, coffee, maple, bourbon, chocolate, oak.  
The maple sweetness, heavy roasted malt, bitterness, chocolate, wood, and coffee in a lesser way, all really make for an insanely drinkable brew.  Mild tobacco notes counter balance.  An excellent breakfast beer. 422 charactersrodbeermunch, Dec 23, 2015

4.85/5  rDev +4.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.75In the interests of full disclosure, this had been one of my wants for a long time. When I finally got it (fall '14), I was worried it would've fallen off considerably. But much to my delight (and pleasant surprise), it tasted amazing and held up extremely well, especially compared to the CBS I had on tap in spring '15. Just a great beer all around.
Poured from a 750 ml bottle
A - pours dark black with little head (very similar to KBS, which is not a surprise)
S - mmm, smell that maple sweetness; there is a hint of chocolate as well, but not many coffee notes
T - lots going on (maple, vanilla, some chocolate notes), but with the aging, you can actually taste the base beer instead of a bourbon bomb.  There is sweetness, but it's not sugary.  The bourbon has mellowed considerably, and is less noticeable than the fresher beer on tap.
MF - much like KBS.  This isn't a very viscous beer, and if you're looking for a BCBS feel, you're not going to get it.
O - an overall amazing beer, and I would go out of my way every time to get it on tap. 1,051 charactersChris_H_2, Dec 01, 2015

2011 aged, bottle to rocks glass. Philly beer week. Fiume Bar. Share 3oz pour with DC. Amazing. Complex. Candy. Maple influence is slight, but an overall sweetness really makes this delicious. Bourbon, coffee, chocolate, maple, love. In a bigger pour, would it become too sweet? In all likelyhood, I?ll never get the chance to find out.

Comes out dark as night with a small brown head that fades to nothingness. Smell is boozy, hints of raisin and fig, touch of wooden barrel, very big. Taste is layered to perfection. It stands on the sweeter side, big notes of chocolate and molasses. Hints of rum soaked fruit in the middle. Finish is long and sticky, you can taste the maple syrup here along with some roasty notes. While it sits heavier in the stomach, this beer is really easy to drink. There's not a ton of carbonation and that's OK. It's a big beer that demands to be sipped and is super rewarding if you do so. This is truly an amazing beer, waited a long time to have it. 707 charactersBranfordBound, Nov 20, 2015

I didn't get much maple flavor from it, subtle at best. Glad I tried it but definitely a lot of hype and not a lot of bite. 403 charactersBerkshireGuerrilla, Nov 11, 2015

4.75/5  rDev +2.6%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75On tap at Doherty's Ale house, added from notes:
Appearance: deep, obsidian black in body, with a tiny rim of dark brown on the edges when swirled. Thin, but persistent mocha-colored head, that dissipates after a minute or two into a slim collar around the edge of the glass.
Aroma: One of the most balanced and delectable smelling stouts I've had. You can smell the maple and bourbon from a yard away, if not more. Upon closer sniffin' around, the beer has a layer of coffee roast in addition to the obvious and pungent maple and barrel scent. The whole bar smelled of CBS.
Taste: one of my favorite types of beer, the maple stout. This one does not disappoint at all. Tastes like rich milk chocolate, with layer upon layer of decadent, dessert-y flavors. Bitter roast of coffee, vanilla and wood from the bourbon barrel, and lots of maple syrup. It's a fantastic, amalgamation of flavor.
Feel: heavy and viscous, although it isn't as high in percentage as some double/imp stouts, it delivers fully in body. 
Overall: one of the top 10 beers I've ever tasted in all likelihood, and second only to Good Morning in terms of maple-y stouts. 1,143 charactersTheElectricOne, Oct 17, 2015
5/5  rDev +8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Had on tap. This was the white whale that I could have only dreamed of having since I had tasted my first craft beer 4-5 years ago.
L: Pours a pitch, impenetrable black with a small dark khaki colored had that became nothing but a ring after a few second. I hold this up to the light and see nothing but black.
S: Smells of coffee, alcohol (at first) and a faint maple sweetness. I pick up some chocolate as well. This smells very nice, but the initial pour that I had was colder than it should be. As this warmed, the aroma became more pronounced and the coffee and maple were able to shine.
T: As previously mentioned, the initial pour was pretty cold which yielded some alcohol. I am rating this on what I tasted as this warmed. Coffee and sweet bourbon come through in a strong way. There is a sweetness that is brought forth by the maple syrup that makes this very desirable. The flavors mesh well together and the way this beer is constructed, each flavor is able to shine through throughout the experience. I have had more maple forward coffee stouts, but as a Founders barrel aged stout, I get exactly what I'm expecting, which is a smooth, well rounded stout.
F: This feels higher than the 10.6% that Founders says this is. This is a thick, chewy stout, but it's pretty easy to drink. I was able to polish off 12 ounces of this in a relatively short time. As this warms, the alcohol presence predictably disappears and allows this stout to become smoother and well balanced.
Overall: I had supremely high hopes for this beer. This was the beer that I dreamed to have when I first started getting into craft beer. I actually started drinking craft beer about a month after this beer was released. This beer had some sentimental value to me as it was released on the day that my grandmother passed away. I put this beer on my list of white whales with the understanding that I may never try this in my life. This beer lives up to the hype for me. It is not as coffee or maple forward as some other beers that I have had. However, CBS is a beer brings flavors together in a way that other breweries cannot do. I am completely satisfied and if I ever see this beer available again, I will not hesitate to order it. 2,224 charactersRichD, Oct 17, 2015

I thought at first it was a tiny bit too sweet, until I had another (4.25+ on BA) imperial stout that proved just how balanced CBS is. This beer is just perfectly balanced, truly amazing. I always want a tiny bit more carbonation in these, but even this was a minor detractor. So delicious. 406 characterstmentzer, Oct 01, 2015

Dark black pour. Small dirty head.
Smells of slight vanilla, roastiness, sweetness. Very mouthwatering.
The smell follows through on the taste. Up front the roastiness and barrel character come through (vanilla, slight wood). There is no heat in the aftertaste, just a nice sweetness that lingers.
The mouthfeel is thick and completely coats the mouth. 369 charactersRJIV, Sep 14, 2015

4.69/5  rDev +1.3%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Had this beer in a 12oz snifter at a KBS-CBS-Blushing Monk tasting event.  Beautiful pitch black pour with a dark khaki head.  Mouthfeel is on the thicker side like its other breakfast stout brethren.  The syrupy-sweet of the maple syrup really builds on the (already excellent) smell of KBS, and adds another layer to the taste, but 4 or 5 ounces in, that sweetness starts to get cloying.  Ultimately the maple syrup addition is a nice tweak to an already phenomenal base beer, but compounding the saccharine notes of bourbon with still-more-saccharine maple syrup was a little much for my tastes.  Though I'd place the standard KBS higher on my personal list, this is the superior choice for anyone who wants to go sweeter still.  Regardless, personal nitpicks aside, this is an incredible beer. 797 charactersLAp, Sep 12, 2015

This resembles a mixture breakfast sausage and vanilla, doused in maple syrup.
And I mean that in the worst way possible. 
It Looked great. Didn't smell bad either. I'm sorry but the taste is just gross. 
Don't get me wrong it's still a decent beer but I don't think this is world class at all. I would give it like an 80 out of 100 406 charactersyungbrew, Aug 24, 2015

I'd take the KBS over this one, probably, but let's be real here: this is the epitome of the style.  Smoother than it should be, and reasonably balanced, but the flavor tips over to maple pretty heavily.  Still, you get a fair share of chocolate, wood, practically no bitterness, and a decent head but mild carbonation.  Rich and succulent, this would be the perfect desert beer after a hefty steak and paired with some chocolate cake or something, or just sipped by itself beside a fire.  Not worth the 5 star rating, but get some if you can! 676 charactersjmasher85, Aug 03, 2015

A perfect blend of coffee, chocolate, bourbon & maple syrup. All the flavors complement each other and none over power. Leaves a great chocolate and coffee aftertaste. My mind is blown. A complexity of flavors that keep evolving through the drinking experience. Love this beer 557 charactersStevem68, Jul 26, 2015

Appearance is pretty thick, but not motor oil thick, which is what I look for in a stout.
Nose is good, but just missing that pop. Sweet, somewhat roasty, but the maple doesn't pop like I want it too. Almost has a lactose like thing going.
Taste is better, maple comes out more but it's not too big, definitely nothing like KBBS. Sweet but not cloying and very smooth. 
Feel is almost perfect, I'd just prefer it to be a little thicker. But it's almost there and still really great.
CBS is really really good, and I generally rate high, but it's not perfect. If you can find it on tap, definitely give it a shot. I doubt the 2011s are worth going for unless you want the tick. 815 characterscultclassic89, Jul 20, 2015

But its cousin CBS is an entirely different beast. Much more smooth in my opinion. More foreword CO2. The vanilla and coffee flavors expose themselves  far more to my pallet. I do enjoy this on the colder side, as the vanilla-ish taste isn't overtaken by the ABV and the cold feel is contrasted perfectly with the warmth the alcohol brings to the back of the tongue. Spectacular beer. Really must try to find it in a bottle. 525 charactersbrother_rebus, Jul 17, 2015

4.64/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Typical imperial stout appearance: black as oil, with a persistent lacy head and a few faint bubbles of carbonation. Pretty, but plenty of stouts look better than they taste. This, however, is not one of them.
The aromas are dominated by a sugary, maple-syrup scent, closely followed by coffee, whiskey, oak, and hints of fruit, with the barest whiff of booze.
On the tongue, the beer presents a nicely rich mouthfeel, with just enough carbonation to keep things deliciously drinkable. Flavors roll in with a big hit of sweet coffee and maple syrup up front, closely followed by a wave of whiskey. Heady flavors of buckwheat, bittersweet chocolate, oak, pecans snd hazelnuts and more whiskey roll through, with the sometimes slightly overwhelmingly sweet maple syrup and coffee always reappearing. More subtle flavors appear on the back end of the palate, with blueberries, dried fruit, and even a slight hint of mint-tea and herbal hop notes. On the back of the tongue, loads of spices make an appearance, including cinnamon nutmeg and cloves. Finish is, surprisingly, medium-dry, making up somewhat for the assertive sweetness throughout. 1,142 charactersVikingBeer, Jun 08, 2015

Pours a jet black with a tan head dispersed around the edge of the glass.  Smells of coffee, roasted malt, sweetness from the maple syrup, vanilla, and oak.  Taste is amazing. Coffee, bitter chocolate, bourbon, maple syrup. The maple syrup seemed to cut some of the bourbon/oaky notes and blend together very well. Slight alcohol warming on the very back. I felt the alcohol warming in my stomach half way through the glass. Mouthfeel was above medium, yet smooth and creamy.  Overall, definitely one of the best Imperial stouts I've ever had. 603 charactersBayouBengal1537, May 23, 2015

Draft, snifter
A – Deep black, opaque, with a quarter-inch of dark tan / light brown head.  Even foam, actually sticks around for a while.  Does not appear particularly thick or viscous, but this beer definitely has legs. 
S – Rich chocolate with light vanilla and oak notes, all relatively subdued.  A touch of honey-like sweetness (presumably related to the maple syrup).  Perhaps some floral or woodsy hop notes, not much detectable.
T – Vanilla is very high, followed by milk chocolate and a hint of maple, similar to French toast.  Hops are earthy, maybe some light fruit, mostly contributing bitterness which rides along with sweetness on the finish.
M – Carbonation if fairly low, though quite present.  Body is moderate-thick, not oily but slightly slick.  Stays fairly juicy and sweet throughout, with bitterness on the finish to balance and both lingering on the aftertaste. 
O – I certainly am aware of the accolades this beer has received and its white whale status, and it is certainly worthy of some of the hype.  I got to try it thanks to some fortunate timing, and am glad that I did.  In a vacuum, this is an excellent imperial / barrel-aged stout, and the maple definitely shows in the final product.  I would recommend it, but wouldn’t go crazy trying to find it. 1,313 charactersinfinitebruner, May 23, 2015

Sweet but well balanced. The coffee and bourbon are toned down here in comparison to KBS and play very well together with the maple. Rich, creamy mouthfeel. Well hidden alcohol. I'd love to see this in attainable bottles at some point. Guessing others may feel the same. 427 charactersZaximus, May 20, 2015

Aroma is a mix of bourbon, chocolate, and maple sweetness and some coffee bitterness. In the taste the bourbon barrel is strong at first,, eventually giving way to a chocolate and subtle maple syrup sweetness. The sweetness continues into the finish with the addition of coffee bitterness as well.  Feel is very full bodied and low in carbonation.  Overall, the combo of maple and bourbon makes for a delicious sweetness that is perfectly balanced with the coffee bitterness. Definitely a world a world class beer with very few quality alternatives of the same style, which for that reason alone makes this a must try even if it requires a little extra effort. 728 charactersCTbrew32, May 19, 2015

A- pours pitch black in color with a small creamy khaki colored heads that reduces to a ring around the edge 
S- huge aromas of dark chocolate and bourbon with sharp toasted oak and barrel juice, toasted coconut, caramel, toffee, burnt brown sugar. The maple adds a deep sweetness of molasses and enhances the bourbon aroma 
T- deep dark chocolate malt upfront mixed with boozy bourbon barrel, adding flavors of toasted coconut, toasted almond & caramel/toffee. The bourbon continues through the mid palate before giving way to the sweet maple syrup, adding flavors of molasses and more caramel. The finish adds notes of dried fig, prune and date, before closing with more bourbon and maple 
M- medium viscous body with low carbonation leads to a creamy mouthfeel that continues into a silky warming finish

4.68/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75I got a snifter of Founder's Canadian Breakfast Stout today at Big E's Sports Grill.  I've been wanting to try this beer for more than a few years and I pretty much gave up on being able to try the newest batch, but I was lucky to be able to get a glass right before the keg kicked, so lets see how it goes.  2014 Vintage. 
A-  It poured a nice looking black color that didn't let any light come through and it had a finger and half worth of slightly creamy darker tan head that died down top a thin ring that stayed till the end and it left plenty of patchy lacing behind.  This is a very nice looking beer, I have no complaints.
S-  The aroma starts off with a lower amount of higher sweetness with t the malts being the first to show up and they impart some nice roasted malt and sweet malt aromas with a good amount of chocolate coming through along with a lighter coffee aroma.  Up next comes a nice maple syrup aroma that goes right into the barrels which impart some nice boozy, vanilla and lighter bourbon aromas with just enough oak aromas coming through.  This beer has a very nice aroma, but the boozy aromas are a little heavy.
T-  The taste seems to be similar to the aroma and it starts off with the a lower amount of higher sweetness with the malts still being the first to show up and they impart the same roasted malt aspects with some chocolate and a light coffee flavors coming through.  Up next comes the maple syrup which impart a nice natural maple syrup aroma and it's followed by a somewhat light boozy flavor.  On the finish comes the barrels which impart the same nice bourbon aspects that it did in the aroma and on the finish there's no bitterness with some boozy sweetness taking it's place and it had a nice maple syrup, chocolate and bourbon like aftertaste.  This is a great tasting beer, it's got great balance and while it is sweeter than KBS I find that maple syrup sweetness helps bridge the malts and the bourbon barrels together.
M-  Fairly smooth, velvety, not too crisp, a little creamy, full bodied with a lower amount of carbonation.  The mouthfeel was great and it worked well with this beer.
Overall I thought this was a great beer and I thought it was a great example of the style, it had all the aspects that I look for in the style and it turned out to be a very tasty beer and it lived up to being even better than KBS.  This beer had good drinkability, i would have no problem drinking a few snifters of it.  What I like the most about this beer was the balance and complexity they were the highlights of this beer.  What I like the least about this beer is the boozy aroma, i wish it was hidden a little better.  I would for sure buy this beer again on draft and hopefully in bottles one day.  I highly recommend this beer, I think ti's a must try for every craft beer drinker.  All in all I really enjoyed this beer and it lived up to the hype, I had to really search this beer out, but I thought it was worth it.  It's my new favorite Founders beer and it's the best barrel aged stout I've  had.  Fantastic job guys, this was a world class beer. 3,102 charactersStoutHunter, May 12, 2015

Aroma is nutty, dark, and slightly boozy. Some dark fruit, caramel, and coffee.
Flavor is big, sweet, boozy, and thick. The sweetness is immediate but not overpowering: dark fruit, maple syrup, and bourbon. Chocolate, coffee, and oak. Thick and dense flavors.

Look - Dark oil body. Thick tan head with small bubbles.
Smell – Whiskey. Chocolate. Sugar (maple).It smells like chocolate chip Eggo waffles.
Taste – Chocolate. Whiskey in the end but smooth vanilla finish.
Feel - Smooth and creamy. Doesn't explode with carbonation but isn't flat. This is what I imagined coffee would feel like as a child haha.
Overall – 2/4 for CBS in Columbus isn't bad, right. The time off work was worth it. Get it if you can. I hope I can have this from a bottle in the future. 546 charactersmadelfonatree, May 08, 2015

Don't regret going out of my way to enjoy this at all!  Some people may think the finish is a little sweet from the maple but it was perfect IMO.  Thinner mouthfeel than BCBS and that's the only reason for a lower rating there.  But this is THE template for a great BA stout... 303 charactersNewport_beerguy, May 08, 2015

A beer that lives up to the hype.  The maple syrup and sweetness really come through although the beer is not overly sweet. CBS was a little more mellow than KBS and the alcohol was less apparent,  but this brew is no less complex.  All in all, amazing.  Like many on this site I raise a skeptical eyebrow to the "5" rating, but this beer truly deserves it.  If you're a fan of craft beer...or a beer fan in general...or a human being...you should try this beer!! 606 charactersSHDoyle, May 02, 2015

Smell is rich vanilla, cocoa, molasses, oak, with hints of maple and smoked malt. Wow is all one can say to the taste. Bourbon heat is mellowed out to a caramel-sugar sweetness, rich molasses, with a syrupy cocoa clinging to the palate. Flavors really open up when brought to room temperature. The mouthfeel and body are what really make this beer elite. Silky smooth from start to finish. A real treat I am happy to have finally tried. Cheers! 558 charactersRyBrew54, May 01, 2015

M: it's a heavier mouthfeel, and is sticky and chewy. Not much carbonation
O: real glad I got the chance to try it. It's absolutely perfectly harmonized and is possibly the smoothest barrel aged beer I've ever had. Excellent. Please give this a chance to warm up, as it warm it becomes even more amazing 602 charactershopsputin, Apr 25, 2015

Look: Pitch black with a decent layer of tan foam
Smell: Maple syrup, chocolate, caramel.
Taste: More maple syrup with very noticeable licorice notes. It's amazing that the syrup degrades over time into licorice, I never would have anticipated that. Lot's of chocolate in there as well. A fresh batch would be quite a different experience.
Feel: Very smooth overall, medium body, kind of wish it was a bit chewier.
Overall: I loved drinking this and I am really happy to have tried the 2011 batch. It's an excellent experience in the effects of aging beer and how the taste can change considerably. 625 charactersGet_Lowell, Apr 23, 2015

Though it will not see bottles again for years (according to the Founders rep), this beer is worth seeking out on draft whenever available. Bottles that remain are certainly worth trading for.
Edit: July 2016
On draft at a couple of accounts in Vermont as a bonus treat courtesy of the Founders team following Brewfest. 
This beer, while still amazing, has fallen off. The maple notes are distant and the chocolate flavor has turned to more of a licorice profile. 
Definitely still worth drinking but not with the expectations that it will taste as great as the 2015 draft and growler fill versions. 680 charactersrodmanfor3, Apr 17, 2015

4.66/5  rDev +0.6%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75In my view, pretty much every imperial stout would be improved if the carbonation were smoothed out to the level of this batch of CBS. I had an 8oz pour, served at around 55 degrees at a tapping event this spring. The maple flavor, while a solid core of the beer, was still subtle enough that it didn't mask the beautiful roasty malts. Rather, it made its influence known by being present at the nose, on contact, and as a lingering whisper at the finish. 
I was surprised to find I didn't smell much coffee, despite a robust initial head of about 1cm. But if I hadn't been expecting coffee, I wouldn't have missed it. Overall, a beautiful sweet balanced gem, that I may never get to try again. (I hope I do.) 710 charactersschris, Apr 12, 2015

4.75/5  rDev +2.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75I'll be the first to admit that I'm a skeptic by nature; I generally assume "whales" are going to be overrated, and when it's a coffee stout I try it only out of obligation, because I'm not a coffee stout guy. 
CBS is one of the extremely rare times that I've found the hype to be completely justified, and I've got to admit I'm really surprised. I don't like FBS, and I think KBS is vastly overhyped, so to find out that CBS is not only worthy of praise, but that I actually really like it is crazy to me. On to the beer.
Pours a nice, small brown head. The beer itself isn't quite black, but it's very dark, and pretty thick. 
I didn't do a lot of smelling (too busy pouring it into my face), but there was a nice intermingling of coffee/bourbon and a hint of maple. But who cares, because the taste is next.
Alright, wow. Lots of chocolate in the taste (and when I say chocolate, I mean that it actually tastes like fudge, not like it gives an impression of a "chocolate-like flavor"), and a nice, mellow coffee. There are hints of maple, but that side mostly adds sweetness and counters the coffee. This is important, because I dislike coffee in my stouts, and this is the first time I've tasted one that's so well-integrated. 
There's more balance to this beer than I expected; most coffee stouts come across as very coffee-forward and bitter, while this beer is the opposite. In fact, this might be the only time that I've accepted coffee in a stout as a necessary factor (to balance the maple sweetness). 
Up to this point, BCBCS was my favorite coffee stout--I didn't love it, but I really liked it, despite the coffee. I've tried a bunch of the better coffee stouts out there, and never really been blown away, until now. Is this my favorite stout? No; I still like a few of the Bourbon Counties better, and I'm still generally going to prefer stouts without coffee. However, I can honestly say that this is now on my list of must-try beers when they go on tap (or bottle sale), and is one of my favorites. 
Phenomenal job by Founders; if only they could make this with more frequency. 2,101 charactersSeanBond, Apr 07, 2015

The nose was a bit soft but playful with light coffee, oak wood, chocolate and bourbon. The front end displayed a delicious and decadent chocolate that opened to a roasted coffee. The bourbon is subtle with some added caramel and toffee. The funny thing is that the maple is ever present, never pervasive and blends seamlessly throughout. This is so smooth and velvety that it really lives up to the hype. 493 charactersKYGunner, Apr 04, 2015

It has a rich aroma of maple syrup and oak with a touch of coffee and roasted barley. It pretty much delivers on the nose in the flavor. Very authentic, prominent maple syrup that is held in check and restrained from being too rich by the bitterness from the coffee, which is a smoother, more subtle flavor than in FBS or KBS to me. Also lots of oats and barley. 
Body is fairly viscous and hefty, and a tad syrupy. 
The best maple beer I have had by far, and worthy of the hype. 547 charactersWesMantooth, Apr 02, 2015

A: single finger creamy dark tan head on a jet body with excellent lacing. No light getting through 
S: coffee, vanilla, dark fruit, spearmint, bourbon booze, milk chocolate... Really a touch light on aroma but picked up as it warmed.
T: much sweeter than I was expecting. The coffee flavor is all throughout but without much bitterness. Maple and vanilla dominate. Bourbon is disguised as applying sweetness without the liquor sting. Complex and flavorful. Nothing off putting and is close to the hype as almost no beer can match the hype like that surrounding this one.
M: may be the best part. So silky smooth, perfect degree of coating the palate. No bad aftertaste. 
Overall: so happy I got to try it. Now that I havr I will likely randomly and unintentionally come accross it a dozen more times. Worth the wait but still not the best beer I have add but damn close 940 characterskylehay2004, Apr 01, 2015

Big sweet maple syrup presence jumps out after warming a bit. There is some slight bourbon coming trough with coffee and chocolate. 
Lots of sweet syrup and spirit going on. The coffee pops really well in the flavor with a big roastiness that lingers with the chocolate and bourbon. 
Medium bodied with mild carbonation. Drinks really smooth and velvety. Ends a little dry with some sugary stick. Could use a touch more body but that's just being picky. 
When I first got into beer this was the whale du jour. Never thought I'd get to drink it. 602 charactersMattSweatshirt, Apr 01, 2015

Pours a deep brown, nearly black body with a deep brown mocha colored head that reduces to a thin layer of foam. Sparse spotty lacing.
Aromas are very whiskey heavy, vanilla and light chocolate with a pretty substantial boozy background. Aromas develop and intensify as it warms.
Upfront is sweet milk chocolate, cocoa, whiskey, developing into absolutely delicious heavy roasted coffee, maple, vanilla. The finish is roasty malt and bittersweet chocolate. Thick, chewy mouthfeel, low carbonation.
Amazing. Complex, flavorful, full bodied. Let it warm up to let the layers come out. 647 charactersgcamparone, Mar 25, 2015

'14 was a good bit thinner than the previous '11 release and you could tell by the pour and mouthfeel.  Slightly different base so I can appreciate that.  Way sweeter without nearly as much roast and the thinness really took away from this for me.  Had with MBCP and DB Mexican Cake the same day.....'14/'15 CBS would be behind those two for me. 386 characters4lo, Mar 22, 2015

Flavor is very roasty and dense with a bunch of java, chocolate syrup, maple syrup, burnt sugar, and bourbon. Espresso and dark chocolate. The feel is very syrupy and thick. Sticky with noticeable heat and lingering barrel character. Finally got to notch this one on the bedpost. A pretty terrific beer. 402 charactersVelvetExtract, Mar 22, 2015

The aromas and flavors in this beer were just so complex.  There were notes of coffee, maple, bourbon, coffee, roasted malt, some sweetness, and vanilla.  
It had a nice tan head that left quickly, and this beer was thick and chewy.  I can't think of how a stout could be better. 365 charactersBrams17, Mar 19, 2015

poured too cold, got a good bit of maple then and not much booze.
more boozy as it warmed, but the maple really showed through.  definitely a very impressive stout that could once have been considered the best, but nowadays has a lot of competition. still world class.  mouthfeel is still great.  a beer worth seeking out but not one that you should abandon everything for. 395 charactersAxnjxn, Mar 16, 2015

5/5  rDev +8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5The first actual full review I've done so I figured it would have to be a special beer and we most certainly have a special beer here
A: pours a pitch black liquid with a very tan head, not as much viscosity as day a bourbon county but it's definitely dark.
S: first thing you smell is that delicious maple syrup, keep going and you get hints of coffee and coconut and subtle dark chocolates
T: I had half of this beauty cold and half warm and those states you have 2 different beers and both are phenomenal.  Cold taste-you get a lot more of the coffee and chocolate here with subtle maple syrup and all around smooth drinking beer.  Warm taste- this is where this beer takes a whole new form and you get maple syrup right away, followed by some coconut and oak flavors and on the after taste you get a nice coffee bitter chocolate flavor that just leaves you wanting more, perfection.
F: I will say it's not at thick as most of my favorite stouts but it's not far behind and I like it for that I like a stout to not be overly think and feel like you just took a mouthful of motor oil.  Some beer that make its better judging on the flavors you have going on but this one with all the flavors you have it lets you taste them all and you really get to get an equal taste of them all instead of just tasting coffee throughout.
O: overall this is what all barrel aged stouts should stride to be. It has all the flavors you would want and more with the added maple syrup 10/10 would drink 1,485 charactersUltimate, Mar 15, 2015

Came out cold with a beautiful head, pitch black.    This beer is most certainly not meant to be drank cold, so I took a few reference sips and let it warm.    When warmed, this is one of the best beers I have ever had.   Oak, chocolate, bourbon, vanilla, and a touch of maple sweetness.   So glad I was able to have this, it is, in my opinion,  the perfect BA stout. 452 characterstmbgnicu, Mar 12, 2015

4.78/5  rDev +3.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5On tap:
Look is nice and dark, head a lighter tan.  The head is kind of sparse, but does last at the edges throughout the pour.  Nose of bourbon barrel with a hint of sweetness.  I also get a light smokiness, it seems to me.
Taste starts sweet, maybe the maple influence; if not it's a dark sugar-like sweetness.  The next taste I get it sorta bourbon-and-coke.  At this point the beer is a tad colder than ideal, I think (review is on 2nd pour).  As the beer warms the woodiness comes out a bit more (also in the nose).  Also the bitter roasted coffee notes come out (in place of cola) with warmth.  The bitterness against the opening sweetness is a slight bit heavy, to me.
Feel and body are pretty full, with a little alcohol heat and minimal carbonation.  The feel mellows a tad as the beer warms, smoothing out the edges.
A very solid, top notch beer.  It's really a debate for me where this belongs amongst the cream of the crop of my top beers.  I don't think it overtakes them for overall enjoyment (see sweet front vs roasted bitter back), but it belongs in the group. 1,080 characterscjgiant, Mar 11, 2015

This struck me as a bit of an "amped-up KBS" which, I guess it is! Just delicious and highly recommended if you can find it. 330 charactersDonco, Mar 10, 2015

A- Dark black body. Like black coffee, but noticeably viscous. One finger mocha head with nice retention. No lacing. Eventually the head dies down after maybe ten minutes into a thin collar. 
S- Glorious chocolate aromas come out. Milk chocolate, rich roasty coffee and some whiskey and oak. There is a fair bit of maple in the nose as well, but it's not maple soaked pancakes if that makes sense. Some maple but not a ton, the star is coffee and chocolate with a nice light bourbon aroma. 
F- Plenty of coffee; rich roasted coffee bean and even more milk chocolate, like Lindt's. The latter half of the beer brings a nice complex combination of maple and bourbon. More maple than bourbon really, some oak. Very nice sweet finish that is slick and coating, like actual maple syrup; there is more maple syrup in the taste than in the nose but again, it is not overpowering. It is complementary to the other flavours in this beer. Overall wonderful chocolate maple syrup flavours that play together very well.
M- Thick bodied, substantial and oily on the palate. It's like I went Supertroopers and pounded some maple syrup. It coats the tongue in nice chocolate-forward maple syrup sweetness that is cut by bitter roasted coffee. Wow.
O- This lived up to the hype for me. Delicious stout that isn't actually maple heavy, but it feels maple heavy on the finish with a ton of chocolate and coffee. Altogether, this is a very different beer than Good Morning or Mornin' Delight but I honestly think these are very different beers (coffee, chocolate and aged in maple bourbon barrels vs coffee and added maple syrup) and I haven't had anything quite like this before. Worthwhile and would definitely go out of my way to drink this again. 1,807 charactersStevedore, Mar 01, 2015

So I was pumped to finally get a chance to try this beast.  It did not disappoint.  While the maple was not prominent in the smell, it was perfectly present in the taste without being syrupy.  Mouthfeel was spot-on, and probably the best feeling stout since BCBS.  As far as Founders rankings go, I would put them in this order CBS > FBS > KBS (all behind BCBCS, however). 460 charactersDarthGuitarHero, Feb 25, 2015

T: Sweet. Serendipitously, extemporaneously, syrupy. Sure, there is a hint of chocolate, but as the sniffer glass warms in my hand, the sweetness just exponentially expanding in the nose and in my mouth.
F: What mouthfeel? It's like sipping on diluted boozy maple syrup. Once that coating starts, it quickly spread, through you tongue, through the inside of your cheek. Hold your mouth close and breath in through you nose, and you feel like you just finished a pancake breakfast with Aunt Jemima drizzling on top. Reminds me of Sweet Repute.

This pours a jet black in color with thin lacing.
There's a big boozy aroma on this, at first, with a pronounced maple aroma. The flavor comes off sweet but not cloying, with a light roast providing some contrast to the maple-rum flavors. Opens as it warms.
Review 1300! 342 characterselNopalero, Feb 18, 2015
4.57/5  rDev -1.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Enjoyed on tap at one of many CBS-related events here in Kansas City--this one was at Bier Station. Poured into a small Belgian-style snifter glass.
Appearance (4.0) - Not a particularly noteworthy looking beer. Hard to rate, as they started to pour 15 minutes before the "official" tapping to help manage the shoulder-to-shoulder throng of people waiting to try this sought-after beer. Looks to have about a finger of mocha tan head when first poured (luckily, I was up at the bar to see), but by the time it gets into my hands, it still has a ringlet of the brown foam and just a couple spots of lacing intermittent on the sides of the glass. Liquid is an inky black that lets zero light through, even when held up to the sunlight.
Smell (4.5) - Here is where this beer begins to separate itself. Initially, the aroma carries notes of maple syrup, brown sugar, molasses, roasted malt and bittersweet chocolate. The coffee is hard to detect at first, but seems to waft through the more I smell it and as the liquid gains some warmth. There is some bourbon as well, but it is faint like the coffee. In many ways, this reminds me of a sweeter KBS with less barrel character.
Taste (4.75) - As the aroma was an improvement on the appearance, the taste is now an improvement on the aroma. The bittersweet chocolate and roasty, charred malts are again present, with a subtly sweet element from the maple syrup bourbon barrels, which seem to carry more of that whiskey flavor than they did on the nose. Again, the coffee is a bit faint, but slightly more pronounced than it was on the aroma.
Mouthfeel (4.5) - Viscous and full-bodied, with low carbonation and an almost slick, bordering on syrupy mouthfeel. That said, it doesn't rise to the level of syrup feel I've had in some barrel-aged beers. It still finishes fairly clean for something with this level of sweetness. Some lingering sweetness entices the next sip.
Overall (4.5), a really fantastic beer and I can really understand where the excitement over this one comes from. Though this version was not the original Backstage version, if it had been, it would immediately rank ahead of all the other Backstage beers I've had (with Sweet Repute probably being the runner-up). Glad I got to sample this legendary beer. 2,275 charactersLambicPentameter, Feb 18, 2015

The aroma hits of bitter coffee, chunky chocolate, maple syrup sweetness, bourbon sweetness.
The beer hits of milk chocolate and vanilla throughout, combined with a strong bitter coffee and coffee ground flavor. Dried date and plum comes in the middle as the sweetness of the maple blends with the base beer to create complexities. Towards the end, maple sweetness takes over battles that aggressive bitter coffee flavor.
In the end, this is very much KBS with maple syrup and the maple sure does help cover up the flaws of KBS. 569 charactersdar482, Feb 15, 2015

Enjoyed on draft at Holy Grale in Louisville, KY 
A: Deep black with a head of amber hues and a fine-bubble head. Spotty brown laces that settle in a cylindrical pattern. Thick.
S: Dark malts and bourbon to start. Major notes of maple syrup, bourbon-soaked oak, bourbon, char, coco, fresh-ground coffee, and marshmallow. 
T: Excellent and complex. The maple syrup is upfront. The coffee and hops supply an expected bitterness and the bourbon comes through to smack you with a wonderful wave of warmth. Medium notes of bourbon-soaked oak, marshmallow, brownies, and graham crackers
M: EXTREMELY smooth, silky, viscous, full body, and moderate carbonation.
O: This beats the hell out of KBS. KBS - especially when fresh - can have a char-dominated flavor and the maple cuts that down in this. Very sweet flavors , but not sugary, which is aided by the coffee and hops. This lives to the hype and is one of best crafted beers on the planet. 1,012 charactersmacher0, Feb 15, 2015

Unbelievable, decadent beer!  Aroma was maple, toasty, coffee.  Flavor was very similar to KBS, except the maple came through in hints as the beer warmed.  Mouthfeel was fuller and more silky than KBS.  Such a pleasure to drink. 252 charactersDad_of_Rad, Feb 14, 2015

Black with a clingy beige head that bubbles up into a ring and plasters some lacing on the glass. Aroma is only slightly hot…bourbon, maple syrup, chocolate, vanilla, fairly mild sweetened coffee, nuts, and light molasses.  More vinous than the flavor and increasingly chocolaty.  Flavor is a wonderful blend of semi-sweet chocolate, vanilla, coffee and cream, and maple syrup – surpringly not too cloying.  Smooth and not too boozy at all, the syrup increasing as it warms leading into coffee beans, berries, oak, cocoa, and pipe tobacco.  Full and creamy smooth, though not insanely thick (which isn’t such a bad thing).  I took the better part of an hour to drink my glass, but it was never a struggle – just something I felt the need to savor. 768 characterswedge, Feb 13, 2015

Poured a dark black with an offwhite thick head. Looks amazing. The smell is string rich bourbon with a hint of chocolate. The maple hides on the back and makes it smell even more sweet. Lots of vanilla and oak muddled in there as well. This is about where it went down hill. The beer is very muted by the bourbon in my opinion. It's a little over powering but a little maple comes through on the back end. Dark chocolate again is muted by the barrel. The mouthful is confident thinner than I expected for a barrel aged stout. 
Overall, what can I say about this beer I haven't already said about founders. Over hyped. 707 charactersmlhyatt, Feb 12, 2015

Less chocolate with a maple syrup sweetness than KBS. Really,really good beer but should not under any circumstance be rated higher than KBS. It's  rated higher right now because of the recent draft room releases and not because it is better than KBS. When March comes around that will change. 391 charactersJeffrey84, Feb 12, 2015

Didn't totally blow my mind like some other great BA stouts, but very good. Happy to have this tick. The keg at Waldo Pizza cashed out in 14 minutes. 451 charactersBosoxfan20, Feb 12, 2015

So sweet that it overwhelms everything else. Seemed to get even sweeter as it warmed. Still a really good beer and I'm glad I had a chance to try it, but it's nowhere near the best beer I've ever had and I wouldn't go out of my way to have it again. 487 charactersFrumious_Bandersnatch, Feb 08, 2015

4.86/5  rDev +5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5On draft in a snifter at World of Beer Evanston.
Dark body with nice finger of tan head that lingers for a while. Smell is of the maple syrup, followed by the oak and bourbon notes from the barrel, with plenty of dark fruit, coffee, and chocolate. Taste is much like the smell, maple syrup sweetness, bourbon, vanilla, toffee, oak. The coffee and chocolate lend pleasant bitterness and some sweetness that balances everything together nicely. Balance of flavors in this is superb. Mouthfeel is very full and luscious, a solid body and low-medium carbonation. This beer coats the mouth well and leaves you wanting more. Overall, very complex, with great sweetness that is balanced out by some of the bitterness from the coffee and chocolate.
One of the best beers I've ever had and one that certainly lives up to the hype. Never thought I'd get a chance to try this one. 871 charactersbeersdmf17, Feb 07, 2015

A: Pours a very dark brownish-black, a thin, creamy, off white laced head maybe a mm tall hovers around the edges of the glass. Not 100% opaque/5W-30 consistency like I like them.
S: When first served it's loads of cold pressed coffee. About as fresh as it gets for coffee aroma. As it warms, what a beautiful balanced beer, my goodness. . Awesome smelling stuff. Maple, coffee, chocolate, vanilla, bourbon, damn.
T: After it finally warmed up, I see what the hype is about. It's apples to oranges with KBBS, but man, this is one of the best BA maple/coffee stouts around. Rich velvety chocolates coats the mouth, a surge of maple caresses the tongue, finishes balanced and with just enough vanilla barrel notes (slightly tannic/oaky) to let you know it was BA.
F: Although I don't LOVE the mouthfeel, it's quaffable enough to enjoy a second and a third pour without feeling full to the point where you want to just take a nap. If this had the mouthfeel of FIS, would just about be perfect. 
O: I almost skipped this tapping knowing it was going to be a mess. However, the folks at the Gnome handled this perfectly. And, this is about as close to perfect gets, with well you know not being such. I was surprised by how balanced it was. I could drink this daily for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Please bottle again. 1,505 charactersBlackboardbrewing, Feb 05, 2015

However, the taste and smell are top notch. Maple and coffee dominate the nose. I rarely am able to pick up more than 2 flavors in a beer, but this one has 4 easily distinguishable tastes that do not dominate whatsoever.

A: CBS pours a rich, inky black with a tan or khaki head
S: Oozes maple syrup, lightly caramelized vanilla, and creamy milk chocolate. Heavenly stuff.
T: Tastes like the world's best milk chocolate bar that's been soaked in maple syrup and bourbon. Rich fudge and coffee notes. Tons of milk chocolate, vanilla, bourbon, and maple syrup.
M: Mouthfeel is rich, creamy, luscious, thick, slick, and oily. Endlessly drinkable.
O: One of the best beers I've ever had. 493 charactersblankenhoney, Feb 01, 2015

I had lusted after this longer than any other beer I can remember. But I have to be honest ;  the bourbon was overpowering and it was extremely  cloying. I know Founders does big, bold, in -your- face beers, And I do like some BA beers, but this was too much. Please don't misunderstand what i'm saying here. If you love beers with a huge bourbon flavor, then you will probably enjoy this one. I had BCBS back to back with CBS, and like the GI and plain ol' FBS much better. 559 characterscrazyfoMostout, Feb 01, 2015

4.51/5  rDev -2.6%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Appearance: pours a solid black color. a small tannish head forms with pretty good retention and leaving behind a slight lacing. completely dark and opaque.
Smell: fudge, slight espresso, maple syrup, slight bourbon, some roasted malts.
Taste: opens up with huge amounts of sweet fudge. shows its darker malts a bit and coffee with hints at espresso and roasted barley. After the slight bitterness sweetness takes back over with huge maple syrup and more chocolate. some bourbon can be found from time to time but not overly dominant
Mouthfeel: thick, syrupy, velvety smooth. some alcohol warmth
Overall: a killer take on the breakfast beer. I really like all the fudge taste that comes through. a serious step up from KBS and FBS, certainly worth tracking down. 766 charactersSportsandJorts, Feb 01, 2015

4.9/5  rDev +5.8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75This beer has been on my bucket list ever since I have been in the craft beer world. I finally got to see what the hype was about. 
The smell was wonderful with deep, rich smells coming through. Probably one of the top beers I have ever smelled in my life. 
The taste and flavor did not disappoint.  Rich, maple shines through in this stout. It's not over powering and it's not underwhelming. It's right on par with what I wanted it to be. 
If I was to critique this near perfect beer, it would be that it is a bit thin compared to other stouts. It wasn't a thick, rich feel, like I prefer when I drink big stouts. That's my only complaint...and it's not a big complaint.  It's just my personal preference when it comes to stouts. 
Good job Founders. 754 charactersDroopy487, Jan 30, 2015

Barrel characteristics are present, but so much more going on!  First time getting such a nice chocolate flavor that blends so well with a barrel aged beer.  No one flavor dominates, every sip is a new experience.  Worst part was knowing I probably will not be able to have it again. 378 charactersgibgink, Jan 30, 2015

Perfect taste. Sweet but not syrupy.  Smooth sweetened coffee and maple syrup. Roasted malt and chocolate. Heavy cream and vanilla. Molasses, toffee, caramel.  Some espresso underneath. Hint of cinnamon.
Rich and full bodied. Creamy and sticky on the tongue. Mild carbonation. Sweet flavor lingers. Perfection.
This is a truly standout beer.  Flavors blend perfectly. Nothing overpowers the other flavors. A magical drinking experience. 644 charactersleroybrown10, Jan 29, 2015

4.08/5  rDev -11.9%look: 3.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Brown glass grumbler shared by the very generous Collins, who got it filled in Vermont 8 days ago. Expectations are sky high given its reputation, my love for Founders, and more specifically my love for KBS. Reviewed live at low altitude in Austin, TX. Served cold into an Adelbert's stem-tulip and allowed to warm over the course of consumption. 10.6% ABV.
No bubble show forms as it's poured.
HEAD: None. No lacing. To be fair, this is a growler pour.
BODY: Opaque dark brown-black. No yeast particulate or hop sediment is visible.
Appears undercarbonated. Not unique or special looking.
AROMA: A hint of maple syrup. Bourbon character: faint vanilla, a bit of oak. Dark malts, chocolate malts. The maple rocks my world; that's damned inviting. Certainly on the sweeter side, but it doesn't evoke a dessert beer. I find no coffee character whatsoever. The chocolate is far less pronounced than I expected; at most I get some chocolate malt, but no authentic chocolate. Cream. Maybe some caramel.
No yeast character, overt alcohol, hop character, or off-notes come through. It doesn't have any dark fruit, char, or burnt notes. Roasted barley isn't present, and it's usually a note I miss sorely, but based on the aroma its absence doesn't bother me.
Aromatic intensity is pretty high.
Has easily the best maple character I've ever come across, especially as it warms.
TASTE: The maple syrup isn't as prominent as I'd like, but boy is it good. The dark malt and chocolate malt backbone is nice, and lends it some apt sweetness. Not so sweet that it's a dessert beer. The chocolate is nice, but isn't as evocative or authentic as it could (i.e. should) be. I find no coffee whatsoever. If caramel is present, it's damned subtle - just as it should be. Cream.
No yeast character, hop character, off-notes, or overt boozy alcohol comes through. I would like some roasted barley presence. Not nutty, burnt, toasty, charred, or ashen.
Very well balanced, without too much sweetness. Absolutely cohesive, and almost gestalt. The maple note is emerging more as it warms, which I adore. Good depth and duration of flavour, though the aftertaste doesn't linger. Nice intensity of flavour.
The bourbon barrel character is a bit too subtle and reticent, but it does complement the base beer very well. Subtle vanilla and marshmallow notes are present - and both are marvelous. It doesn't have the white oak you might look for in a bourbon barrel aged beer, but frankly it just doesn't need it. I've experienced bourbon barrel notes that are better than these, but it's rare that the bourbon character just melts into the flavour profile like this does.
Absolutely an intricate build for an imperial stout, but not the most complex brew I've had. As much as I adore it, I'm not finding any coffee whatsoever.
TEXTURE: Creamy, smooth, wet, unrefreshing, slightly overcarbonated, and aptly soft. Slightly gooey, which coaxes out more nuance from the marshmallow. Full-bodied, with a perfect thickness and perfect weight on the palate. Overall presence on the palate is fantastic. This texture elevates the beer - mostly by staying out of the way and just backing up the intricate flavours. Not as sticky or syrupy as you'd think a maple syrup imperial stout would be.
Not oily, gushed, hot, boozy, astringent, harsh, rough, or scratchy.
OVERALL: Not a sipper because it's so damn good. The ABV isn't unnoticeable, but it's not a boozy brew. This is hands down an incredible imperial stout and - as it warms - has some of the best maple character I've ever experienced period. Worth seeking out, but do serve chilled - not cold. This is a beer that's meant to be savored, and I'm happy to say it's worthy of the hullabaloo. Huge thanks to Collins for the share. The maple is transcendent, especially as it warms.

It might be the maple syrup barrels slightly enhancing the experience, but it doesn't come forward as obvious maple flavor or aroma. Somewhat of a letdown given all the hype, but a solid barrel aged stout regardless. 340 charactersDanny1217, Jan 22, 2015

Beer was definitely past its prime so I cannot give it a super solid review, but I will say that it held up very well and was still quite the enjoyable beverage. Hope to see bottles of it again and find it on tap now that it has been re-released.
Today is March 23, 2015 and I have now adjusted my original review of 4.23 since today I had the chance to have CBS on draught at Cask Republic in Stamford. What a beautiful treat. 528 charactersMersh, Jan 18, 2015

Everything about this beer is perfect. Finished off 2 tulips and then decided a third wouldn't be prudent. 
Dark as night, with a thin head, but lacing that lingers. Heavy, boozy, nose. Slightly maple sweetness on the tongue, which was a plus for me. Perfect mouth feel, without  overpowering alcohol aftertaste. I love KBS, Black Notes, and Dark Horse PTF, but this is my favorite BBA Stout. 
Love this beer. Thank you Founders!! 606 charactersBreakfastStout, Jan 17, 2015

A- jet black pour, thin, nutty brown head that dissipates quickly.  Lace lingers on the glass awhile.  
S- wow!  Think a sweeter-smelling Breakfast Stout. Still get the bitter coffee with hints of maple, bourbon and barrel. 
T- doesn't disappoint!  Up first is that coffee bitterness of Breakfast Stout then the chocolate and bourbon come through with just enough syrupy sweetness to balance off the bitterness. Really amazing.

Smells of bourbon, vanilla, syrup, and chocolate. The smell is so balanced it was almost impossible to wait any longer before trying it. Spoiler: it tastes just like it smells. So smooth and balanced and this beer definitely lives up to the hype. A light alcohol burn (whisky flavored) with medium carbonation and a chewy mouthfeel. Overall this beer is fantastic and greatly deserving of its legendary status. So glad I had the chance to finally chase this whale down! 591 charactersBolivian22, Jan 11, 2015

4.48/5  rDev -3.2%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Had this on tap yesterday at Exit 6 Brewing. Reviewed from notes.
This whale has high expectations and doesn't disappoint in its appearance. Black as night and thick coming out of the tap with varying levels of head formation depending on the pour. My first pour had a relatively small head that didn't stick around long, but the second had a thick and dense head that held a 1cm thickness for the entire drink with awesome lacing.
The aroma of this beer was just about as expected with great notes of coffee up front. Coffee aroma is fairly dark and a touch bitter, but is quickly balanced by the maple sweetness. The sweetness isn't overpowering, but rather subtle and gives the beer somewhat of a hazelnut coffee scent overall. Moving on to the taste after it warmed a bit, this one started off with coffee just like in the scent. Coffee is very balanced between the bitter and roasted qualities. Some big dark malts kick in right after the coffee flavor and display a touch of chocolate flavor. The maple barrel provides a subtle and underlying sweetness throughout the whole drink, very similarly to in the smell. There is just a trace of bourbon in the flavor, mainly being some vanilla and spicy barrel notes, but it really melds into the maple flavor very smoothly.
As for the feel of this beer, it is strikingly smooth and thick. It drinks very easily and doesn't show off any of its alcohol. Carbonation was low to maybe medium in strength, but perfectly matched to the style.
Overall, this beer has huge expectations to live up to, and for the most part it does. The maple flavor is a great addition to the base stout's delicious coffee. I wish there was more of the bourbon flavor to go around, but that's just my preference. In the end, this is a very, very good beer, but it is not mind blowing. 1,813 charactersboilermakerbrew, Jan 11, 2015

Came out extremely cold - waited about 30 minutes before tasting.  Pleasant coffee and maple aroma.  Taste was the same, with flavors becoming more pronounced as the beer warmed.  Outstanding mouthfeel.  Some ripe banana aftertaste.
Overall very solid.  However there were sky high expectations for this beer, and it's not on the same level as the heavy hitter BA stouts.  I found it similar to '14 BCBCS, only sweeter, in a good way. 508 charactersThirsty_In_Chicago, Jan 10, 2015

4.84/5  rDev +4.5%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Serving: Two separate 7 oz. pours into some tasting glasses at a CBS tapping event in Chicago. 2014 edition. 
A: Pitch black. Pours a light tan head initially, but gets darker as it's agitated. Good lacing up the glass.
S: Nice dark coffee aroma up front, then soft bourbon notes come through. Maple syrup comes in at the end bringing a nice sweetness to it.
T: Coffee and bourbon right up front, then gets enveloped in maple sweetness, like you just took a bite of some of your favorite home-made pancakes doused in maple syrup. Finish is all fresh maple syrup, but not overpowering by any means.
M: Nice and full. Great balance of coffee and bourbon wrapped in a maple syrup glaze.
O: Man, where to start with this one. I've had the original from the bottle, the 2012 edition at the 15th Anniversary party, and now the 2014. This beer still stands as my favorite BBA Imperial Stout. It's not light-years ahead of some of the other greats by any means, but it's just a special beer and the intangibles put it over the top for me. There's nothing really like it. In a nutshell, it's KBS wrapped in maple syrup, and that's an improvement to me. There's times, especially as the beer warms, that it becomes slightly cloying or too sweet. But other times, earlier in the beer when it's a bit cooler, it's just perfect. The aura and legend surrounding this beer lives up to all the hype.
Recommendation: No matter what it takes, every fan of craft beer needs to try this at least once. 1,487 charactersSparty1224, Jan 10, 2015

Opaque black. Very little head. 
Head is dark tan/brown
Lots of maple aroma. Some bourbon. Caramel/chocolatey notes. 
Tastes wonderful. Lots of maple. Bourbon is just right. Chocolatey. Boozey but not overwhelming - to be expected with this high alcohol. More bourbon/alcohol flavor as it warms. 
Mouthfeel is velvety smooth. Carbonation present but understated.
Would love to get bottles and cellar them if they ever bottle it again. 
Better than KBS. I've been looking forward to tasting for years and I'm certainly glad I got a pour. 
I can't call it perfect because I don't think I'll ever find that beer. 637 charactersquinnlapeer, Jan 08, 2015

Appearance: black with a thin ring of expresso colored bubbles
Taste: The dominate flavors of maple, chocolate and coffee are pretty well balanced along with roast notes. A medium bitterness against a medium strong level of sweetness from caramel malt and some maple making for a moderately sweet beer. There is also some alcohol sweetness an a a bit of dark stone fruit that is more red cherry than anything. 
Mouthfeel: A creamy, full bodied beer with a medium level of carbonation. A light alcohol warmth.
Overall: A very smooth beer with rich, dark flavors of coffee, maple and chocolate. 744 charactersMadScientist, Jan 06, 2015

T: Notes continue along a path of vanilla, coffee, maple, marshmallow, raisin, fig, and of course the presence of a creamy rich chocolate. Flavors are very well balanced, not cluttered, not too sweet, and a nice touch of bourbon
M: Robust for sure: full body, some carbonation, and very drinkable…rich, creamy, silky smooth

Poured thick and sits with almost no head. Smell is a kick of sweet maple, dark chocolate, coffee, bourbon. Taste is exactly the same, it's sweet, maple candy, coffee, bourbon, vanilla, some brown sugar, and dark chocolate. Texture is plenty thick, coats your tongue  and lingers for a long time.This beer is seriously amazing, a sweeter upgrade from kbs, which is already damn amazing so that's saying a lot!

T - same as above.
M - slick and creamy, medium mouthfeel.
O - awesome.  About as good a stout as I've ever had. 290 charactersGPHarris, Jan 01, 2015

S  - Oh my gosh.  Rich malty mocha boozy blend.  The surprise smell here is black licorice, which I did not expect.  Don't like BL usually, but might make the exception here.  Soy present too.
T - Taste is exactly like smell only like 3D.  Incredible.
M - Heavy body, good carb, pretty good balance considering largeness.
D - Not a session, but have been looking forward to trying this one.  It's Xmas Eve 2014, and I think I might drink the whole bottle.  Merry Christmas! 554 characterssrandycarter, Dec 25, 2014

4.79/5  rDev +3.5%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75On tap at the Tap and Mallet in Rochester, NY. I got 2 5 oz pours.
Pours a fairly dark black, with a small foamy half inch head, and a little bit of lacing.
Smells very strongly of maple, with Hershey's syrup, bourbon,  and roasted coffee beans.,
I am finally getting a chance to taste this one, and it tastes exactly like I expected it to taste. Every advertised ingredient is on full display here- syrupy, ultra sweet maple syrup, sweet, creamy chocolate syrup, roasted coffee beans, and sweet bourbon. There is a pretty significant boozy kick on the end of each sip, providing a bit of bitterness to the very sweet flavors up front. I'm not getting a whole lot of roasted malt, but that's likely due to the loads of adjuncts in this one.
This is medium bodied, not quite as thick as I'd like, with a very syrupy mouthfeel. I have the feeling in my mouth that I often have after I eat pancakes. That sort of call-back to a memory I like- eating pancakes- is just one thing that makes this beer really nice. It has a lower level of carbonation, and is really drinkable.
One of the biggest bucket list beers for me is finally crossed off. It is honestly worth the hype, and absolutely amazing. The definition of decadent. 1,226 charactersGreesyFizeek, Dec 23, 2014

A- Black, pretty opaque except for some light coming through on the edges that revealed a  deep brown. Small thin ring of medium brown head but didn't stick around long. 
S- Sweet maple, chocolate, coffee, and bourbon, exactly as described. A bit surprised by how much maple is present but pleasantly surprised. 
T- Follows the nose, nice maple sweetness, chocolate, coffee, a bit of alcohol but the sweetness helps smooth it out, decent bourbon presence but the maple and chocolate and coffee really stand out more. Best enjoyed at a warmer temp. to really let all the flavors come out. 
M- To be honest a bet thinner than many big imperial bourbon stouts I've had but still not really a detracting element. 
O- Certainly the best beer from Founders I've had and a big improvement on KBS, although I'm led to believe they are two different base beers. A prefect beer for Christmas time, you just want to curl up next to a fire and enjoy this stuff. Definitely a beer that lives up to the hype. I can see how some might find it a bit sweet and not more adjunct heavy (chocolate, coffee, maple) than barrel heavy but I think all aspects of the beer are well balanced. 1,221 charactersPaulyB83, Dec 19, 2014

Thick and dark with a lasting brown head. Smells of sweet chocolate and coffee. This beer drinks like a chocolate milkshake. The maple is forward and sweet. Chocolate fudge brownie, coffee and light bourbon flavors follow. The mouthfeel is thick and creamy. This is an ideal dessert beer. It is sweet and decadent. Alcohol, what alcohol? Despite some bourbon flavor there is nearly no heat. Overall it's a little too sweet but I'm very happy to have tried this. 496 charactersbrianmandell, Dec 18, 2014

Not quite as flavorful, nor as complex, nor as smooth as Founders' best product ever, Curmudgeon's Better Half, which had more of the maple present.

4.75/5  rDev +2.6%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75This review reflects both a 2011 bottle enjoyed in 2013 and the 2014/2015 release.  The maple adds a breakfasty smoothness that is incredible to enjoy.  Throw in the barrel and this is an amazing treat.  The second batch felt a little thinner, so no longer an "all 5s" beer, but still a top notch maple beer. 308 charactersmrn1ceguy, Dec 10, 2014

Served in a snifter
L - It is black and beautiful. It pours like motor oil. It is topped off with an inch of mocha head.
S - I smell cocoa, milk chocolate, and faint coffee and maple. 
T - It starts out with cocoa flavors. Then enters the milk and dark chocolate. It finishes with a slight coffee bitterness.
M - Sticky, smooth, and full.
O - This is a great beer. Why did Founders retire it? It is a great beer to celebrate my 40th birthday. 473 charactersbuschbeer, Oct 07, 2014

4.25/5  rDev -8.2%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25I purchased this bottle of CBS over two years ago, and shortly thereafter I heard that this would be retired. I already know this is going to be good...
Appearance - Pours 2 fingers of cinnamon brown foamy head, the body is opaque, and burnt sienna brown to black, no highlights at the sides. Gentle foam rings are left after each sip.
Smell - The very first whiff fills my nostrils with dark ripe fruits and dark soy sauce, then rich moist roasted malt, now some sweetened dark chocolate, a whiff of french roast coffee with a shot of booze. 
Taste - This is so incredibly balanced - at the beginning of the quaff I get all of these flavors at once - really rich roasted malts, warm soy sauce, molasses, dark fruits of fig, raisin, and over-ripe plum, barely sweetened dark chocolate, then as it warms in your mouth you get deep roasted coffee with a little bit of coffee grounds bitterness, pumpernickel crusts, and then there it is... maple and oak. Longer into the finish the maple remains, along with traces of black coffee, dark chocolate and moist oak in the mouth corners. Long after the sip there is astringent coffee grounds, slightly sour dark fruit skins, burnt pumpernickel crust, and slightly sweet maple that keeps it all in check.
Moouthfeel - This is a full mouth filling beer - creamy and silky smooth, lightly coating the mouth. The lips are left sticky with chocolate, coffee and maple syrup. Carb is in the low side, and is smooth and foaming across the tongue, with a few edges that appear as the beer makes it's way over the sides of the tongue. An excellent and contemplative sipper.
Overall - Okay, I'm just going to say it. I've recently had FIS, KBS, and now CBS. And honestly, I would put them in this order: FIS, CBS, and finally KBS. Yes that's right, FIS would be first. CBS is a fantastic IS, but honestly after this bottle I would not seek it out again - I truly feel that FIS is a better beer, and thank heavens, as I can get my hands on this at will. The maple here is very flavorful and interesting, and the balance and complexity here is incredible. I can't knock this beer by any means, but I won't lose any sleep knowing that it is retired. Now if they retired FIS, then we would have a problem... cheers :) 2,251 charactersblackcompg, Jul 20, 2014

4.99/5  rDev +7.8%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured from bottle into a snifter glass
Appearance – The beer pours a thick and viscous black color with a one finger of tan colored head. The head has a good level of retention, slowly fading to leave a moderate level of lace on the sides of the glass.
Smell – The aroma of the beer is of a huge and delicious coffee and roasted malt smell mixed with a strong showing of chocolate. Along with these big and robust darker aromas are strong notes of maple syrup as well as sweet darker fruit smells of raisin, fig, and plum. A decent amount of a bourbon and vanilla are there as well and seem to add a nice dimension of warmth to the aroma inviting one to come and sip the fine roasted nectar that awaits the tongue. 
Taste – The taste begins with a sweet chocolate and roasted malt flavor with the sweetness being a fine balance of maple syrup, vanilla, caramel and the darker fruits that were detected in the nose. While quite dark and roasty upfront, it gains even more robustness in the roast being accompanied by some smooth espresso flavors matched by a faint smokiness. The sweeter flavors all the while stay strong, wonderfully balancing out the big tastes of the brew. Around the middle of flavor profile comes some bourbon tastes mixed with a bit of a woodsy flavor. These flavors, like their counterpart aromas did, bring a warming taste to the brew, bringing on just the right level of “heat”. Right at the very end, after the warm has hit the tongue, a slight surge in the maple syrup flavor is delivered, culminating the taste and leaving a wonderfully smooth and warmingly sweet and roasted, but balanced flavor to linger on the tongue.
Mouthfeel – The body of the beer is huge and thick with a lighter but creamy level of carbonation. The combo of thick body and subdued carbonation is magnificent for the big and bold blend of flavors in this dark roasty brew and truly create a fantastic medium for all the flavors of the brew a to bath the tongue in all the richness of flavor.
Overall – This is one amazing beer. One of the best if not the best stout I have ever had, and competes with the world wide I had run through the vanilla coffee randall. It is super smooth and approachable with a wonderful blend of flavors that make it a true pleasure to sit back and sip. 2,304 charactersDarkmagus82, May 09, 2014

A - Impenetrable jet black with a cafe au lait head. One finger and then it's gone. Comparable appearance to KBS.
S - Much stronger than KBS. There's not the subtle integration of vanilla, coffee and bourbon, but all of that is present. This is assertively sweet, massively smoky, and rich like espresso. Big, brash, alluring nose.
T - Sweet like a flourless chocolate cake or a dark chocolate mousse, what a huge burnt oak smokiness. The lighter vanilla, toffee, and maple notes only come later. It immediately obliterates your taste buds, but as it warms and you settle in the flavors integrate. By halfway through, it's an incomparable confluence.
M - Thick as oily, sticky and smooth.
I'd liken CBS to falling asleep in a humidor flooded with cocoa. This is a huge, baroque stout. I hear tell that fresh, this brew was dominated by coffee and maple. Those seem less present in this bottle, but I loved ever sniff and sip of it. I couldn't drink this every week (which I definitely could with KBS), but I'd love another snifter of it sometime. Fat chance, that happening. 1,289 charactersTheCuriograph, Feb 07, 2014

A - perfect. Oily blackish-brown. Sliver of khaki head that just hung around the whole way, made for great beer mustache pictures.
S - maple has expectedly faded but still engrained subtlety in the big chocolate and heavy coffee notes that dominate. Getting some vanilla, possibly from the oak?
T - oh man, this is not the "maple mess" that I was scared or misled to believe it has become. The best tasting brew I've ever experienced. Dear god, the roasty sweetness, coffee, chocolate, bourbon, barrel... All still evident, and just melded together divinely.
M - low carbonation, as expected. Lingering taste, oily coating the gums and a tremendous aftertaste that leaves you dying for more.
O - I should clarify, the best brew that I've ever tried that wasn't supposed to be... Sad that I got into great beer late in the game, would've loved to try this fresh. Seek and share my fellow BA's this was a personal white whale that took me down. Permanently ISO:!!!! Can't wait for BrickStone in May. 1,077 charactersAbbbp, Jan 02, 2014

4.84/5  rDev +4.5%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Acquired via trade, possibly my favorite trade thus far. Bottle poured into snifter. 
A: Extremely dark. Not exactly black, but just 1 or 2 shades shy of black, on the brown side. Pours with just shy of 1 finger of khaki head that reduces fairly quickly and leaves almost no lacing.
S: I get a large amount of vanilla and maple up front, and lingering throughout. The roasty bourbon goodness takes a back seat, and compliments very nicely. All the aromas blend together so well.
T: All of the flavors in this mesh so well, I can't believe this is a one off beer. The sweetness of the maple and vanilla hit up front, with a tiny amount of heat from the bourbon in the back ground, and finally the roast rounding out all the flavors almost like a binder for the sweet and heat. 
M: This goes down way too easily for such a high ABV beer. There's a lower level of carbonation, with a silky smooth sweetness that begs me craving for more. 
O: I do my best not to look into the hype of desirable beers, but wow does this one live up to any and all expectations. I love the way all the components blend together, with nothing being overpowering. So complex, well blended depth, and an all around great beer. 1,202 charactersroger617, Nov 23, 2013

A - black with a nice thick mocha head that disappears fairly quick. Nice lacing. Poured straight down them middle into snifter
S - coffee is strong for me, everything else is in the background 
T - coffee ice cream, black licorice , maple, dark chocolate
M - really nice thick syrupy feel
O- overall really good, not as great as I expected, I thought this one was definiltly going to blow me away. I was more impressed when I stumbled upon BB Siren Noir last week (advertised as regular version). It's all about expectations.

You can smell a bit of the maple still on the nose and it lightens up the bourbon scent. Very warm and inviting scent that is well rounded. This beer is very smooth. The slight maple flavor combines well with the vanilla, oak, and light bourbon flavors. The body is well made and slightly thinner than a bourbon county. It is very much a full and richly flavored beer. Some said that the beer has not gained anything with age. I have no base to compare it to. I would say this beer is currently drinking very well but the maple is not acutely strong. You may want to set up a bottle share and get on this one. 677 charactersPHBoiler, Sep 26, 2013

4.2/5  rDev -9.3%look: 4.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Next up in the Backstage Series...CBS! Poured this uber-hype beer into a balloon glass.
The body of this beer is a midnight oil black, and it seems to have a pretty thick texture as well. It is topped by a rich, creamy, frothy tan head that sits about two fingers deep and displays excellent staying power. Hard to criticize much here.
The aroma is a bold mix of all those sweet adjuncts...notes of coffee and cream, chocolate, light maple syrup, roasted grains, vanilla. No hops here.
On the palate CBS hammers the tongue with chocolate, coffee, maple, vanilla and bourbon. There isn't much elegance to it, but what would be the fun in that? No, this beer is huge! Enormous, viscous body and inherently slick on the tongue. The cocoa flavor is a standout, and the coffee comes out more in the exhale. The maple barrel sweetness comes in mid swallow, and then finishes with more chocolate.
Many claim this beer is over-the-hill, and I suppose since I never had fresh CBS, I wouldn't be able to tell personally. However, I can tell that this beer is definitely not "over-the-hill" and that while the maple flavor may has eroded over time, this is still a very good beer. 1,173 charactersMusicaleMike, Sep 23, 2013
5/5  rDev +8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Appearance: Jet black. Menacing brown head. Less then a half of finger of head on the pour. Surprising amount of active carbonation. Some random lacing on the sides of the glass. 
Smell: Heavenly. Lots of sweet maple syrup still alive in the aroma. Rounded bourbon with lots of toffee, chocolate, and deep malt. Every time I take it in a different aroma rises and showcases itself. 
Taste: The front of this beer is so easy drinking and feels soft on the palate then explodes with massive flavors. The maple syrup, chocolate, and toffee really stand out. The bourbon character has mellowed greatly and is a great complimentary accessory. The finish is a slight bourbon tingle and dark roasted malt and chocolate. 
Mouthfeel: This beer is heavy yet drinks so easily. Just an amazing drinking experience.
Overall: My first time with this gem. I hate the 5/5 review but this beer deserves it. I could be more lengthy and masturbatory with my review but this beer speaks for itself. Worth every dollar I spent. 1,010 charactersKFBR392, Sep 20, 2013

Edmonton, Canada, born and raised). We all agreed this ale was delicious from start to finish. Popping the cap, you take in the coffee, chocolate, maple syrup, and bourbon aromas. While pouring, you notice the deep, dark color with a head to match. I wish I would've opened this one a little earlier; however, Founders still came through. Some of the flavors weren't as strong, yet still very bold. As many have said, this is a great beer and I'd definitely recommend this one! 574 charactersvgarneth, Aug 04, 2013

It is pure perfection from the mouth feel being as rich as it is, the maple coffee, wood flavors. This is what everyone that makes beer should aim to do. This is the beer that sets the stage. If you get a chance to trade for one, do it. There might not be as much life in it at this point but it still has to be good. 463 charactersvinny21bal, Jul 31, 2013

Poured from a 650 ml bottle into a snifter.
A: Dark brown or black. Slight, bubbly head. Settles quickly, leaving a foam ring and a slight smattering of bubbles. Spotty, but distinct lacing.
S: Roasted coffee, dark bittersweet chocolate, molasses, and a little maple syrup.
T: Roasted coffee, dark chocolate, and maple syrup.
M: Buttery, hearty, thick, and syrupy. A bit of a char-roasty aftertaste.
D: Sip and enjoy. So smooth, mellow, and balanced.
Overall, this is a great quaff. As good as it gets. 527 charactersbmwats, Jul 21, 2013

S - Bourbon, coffee, roasted malt, bitter dark chocolate, sugary sweetness
T - Chocolaty-bourbon with a coffee backbone. Maple is not very present at all. I drank a Better Half a few weeks before the CBS and the maple in the Better Half is still very dominate.
M - Medium carbonation, really smooth but a little thinner then I was expecting.
O - A very delicious, well made beer. Wish I got a chance to try it fresh. 518 charactersSpaten454, Jul 15, 2013
4.94/5  rDev +6.7%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I would first like to say that so many people talk about how this beer has fallen off and is past its prime. I honestly now believe that if that is true then this must have been the best beer ever brewed in the history of BA stouts. I have been waiting 6 months to open this bottle. here we go
A: Pours a lovely almost pitch-black with an incredible mocha brown head that fades rapidly. 
S: The smell is the only score I did not give a 5 I gave it a 4.75. There are sweet chocolate and a slight roasted coffee on the nose that I am surprised had not faded. There is also a bourbon scent but it is almost all blended together but that is not bad just means its all well integrated as it aged.
T: This is the stuff that dreams are made of. Nice sweet maple bourbon and nice and sweet up front. Then the roast of coffee and slight bitter sweet chocolate come in with the hint of bourbon. very well blended in almost a story telling way with each sip. If this is faded flavors that I am tasting then this must have been the top gun when it released because it is drinking so well and composed right now. 
M: This is also where this beer is perfect in every way for the style. the beer sits on your tongue with each sip and the carbonation is spot on. I couldn't imagine a beer being so well done. 
Overall this is a beer that everyone should try before they die. I have another one and put it FT but I am taking it back. Its so good that if I could never get another then I would never trade it for ANYTHING. Go out and find this beer. even if you have to buy it online for $150. It is worth everything and anything.

S: Some maple upfront, bourbon, chocolate, coffee and oats. A little bit of booze stings the nostrils.
T: Upfront I get oats smothered in bourbon, chocolate and maple with a splash of bourbon. The flavors seemed to be a bit muddled and/or faded. Some waivering vanilla darts in and out. The finish has a sweetness coupled with a lingering roastiness, not bitter though.
M: Hearty for sure. Well carbonated, sweet, chewy. Loads of flavor saturate the palate. Pretty decadent feel.

A- black... And appears slightly oily in consistency/texture. There is a small, dark-tan head that slowly disappears, leaving behind a slight ring around he edge of the glass. The lacing looks oily and bubble-laden, but does not coat/stain the glass like Dark Lord.
S- Bourbony oak, brownie, espresso beans: it's complex, yet faint... Things are not jumping out at me and overpowering each other. I do get a bit of licorice in the end as it warms.
T- slight warmth from the boubon, chocolate cake/brownie,oak, coffee, and some fig and maple in the finish. I still get a touch of maple, but I was also looking for it... I must say it was not detectable until it warmed up. The lingering taste has a nice bourbon ash taste... Ash doesn't sound appealing, but it's quite nice (I'm going to say that is the tobacco flavor). As it gets even warmer, I am starting to get a slight anise flavor I have read about. IMO, these flavors that people have been harping on are making it even more complex and bringing out a lot of depth... I am enjoying it.
M- as the appearance lead me to believe, it is slightly oily, but it has the perfect amount of carbonation. It is smooth, but the alcohol warmth masks it from feeling velvety.
O- this was a special occasion beer, and I must admit that I was quite giddy to try it. It's hard to say whether it stood up to the hype I had built up, but I feel like the fact that it's the 500th different beer I had made it feel special... Besides, I prefer my KBS with some age on it, and I thought Better Half was a bit strong in the maple department when I tried it fresh. That being said, I would have liked the opportunity to try CBS fresh, but that's not how it played out... 1,911 charactersZombiesAteMyDog, Jul 02, 2013

A few other thoughts: It tasted basically nothing like what I expected it to, and I think it has peaked. Many people talk about the maple flavor really falling off after a couple of months, and I think that was the case here. It was so much funkier than I imagined— I got a lot of the oak of the barrel, as well as sort of anise and licorice flavors. As it warmed up, it got much more interesting— too cold out of the tap, it was hops, booze, and tobacco in one big slam. I keep thinking about how distinctive it was, but I am not sure that means I loved it. Basically like reading the Iliad. 852 characterstipfortap, May 23, 2013

HUGE thanks and still feel the need to send some additional studf his way soon. Pours from the 750 ml thick, black and viscous. A one finger brown creamy head forms at the top and lingers for a good while. Big bourbon vanilla aroma that mellows into bittersweet chocolate and then earthy spicy coffee. Taste is big up front chocolate syrup and slight bourbon followed by maple (did not fade in this bottle as others have said), and ending with spicy coffee beans. Earthy mocha lingering on the palate with the maple sweetness. These flavors blend together so seamlessly. Mouthfeel is thick thick thick with lowish carbonation. The bourbon is there but doesn't take over and the coffee ite keeps this from being too sweet. I was worried about being disappointed with this but I am not.

I am a big fan of Imperial Stout beers and Found has tip the scale on this one. I cannot wait to taste it ontap. Founders usually makes an appearance in late Spring in either at Bind Tiger or RattleAndHum on 33rd East street. 284 characterssguzman, May 15, 2013

now to today... in the past month i have opened 2 bottles, one from my stash, one from a friends... the maple has pretty much, i'd say 99% fell off and is damn near gone... and that is what but the C in Cbs... not saying that this thing went bad or anything of the sort, but be advised, the syrup is damn near gone... so if you have a bottle, open the damn thing, or sit on it for eternity. 587 charactersbasickness, May 08, 2013

3.53/5  rDev -23.8%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.25Bottle shared by Oscar and Caitlin, into a snifter.
A. Black with some woody tones, and a small tan head.
S. Thick chocolate, mint-like note, light oak and vague coffee.
T. More chocolate, licorice, hint of coffee, anise, caramel, sugar.
M. Thick-bodied with light carbonation.
O. The only thing that hasn't faded is the chocolate, which leaves the beer quite sweet. No bourbon, no maple, barely any coffee. Some licorice/anise flavors have also developed, which isn't really good. 486 charactersEtan, May 07, 2013

4.71/5  rDev +1.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Big thanks to augustg for this bottle! Reviewed from notes. Poured from 750 mL bottle into a Peg's snifter glass.
A: Dark, nearly black, and opaque. Forms about 3/4 of a finger's worth of tan head, more than expected. No visible carbonation.
S: Bourbon, vanilla oak, sweet (maple syrup?), dark roasted malts - the cacao barely dominant over the coffee - and some lactose sweetness.
T: Dark chocolate beans, bourbon, oak, some coffee, sweet maple, some raw tobacco, and maybe a sprinkle of cinnamon. Bourbon is noticeable but smoothed by the sweetness, and enhances the rest of the flavors. Hang is creamy sweet plus roasted coffee bitter and the oaky vanilla...and is teeth-sucking good.
M: Great mouthfeel - smooth and silky. Low carbonation sensation, and the alcohol is obvious but integrated into the flavors of the beer.
O: Really, really good. Wow. I'm very glad I had the chance to drink this. After hearing many people opine that the maple has fallen off, I wish I had had the chance to drink one fresher - but even as it is today, it still meets and perhaps exceeds the hype. I'm very impressed.
UPDATE: Had this on tap from the second brewing. Absolutely as amazing as the bottle. Very, very good. 1,213 charactersmacrosmatic, Apr 29, 2013

4.2/5  rDev -9.3%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 422oz bottle poured into a HF stemmed glass. Consumed on 4/19 right before '12 + '13 KBS, reviewed from notes, bottle split three ways. I believe this bottle is approaching around a year and half old right now. Thanks Don (DonFrap) for sharing a long time want.
A- Pours a pitch black with a thin creamy mocha brown head, slightly above average retention leaving light lacing. Like most of the Founders beers I've had this beer looks extremely appealing.
S- Dark chocolate, chocolate chips, maple syrup, oak, subtle bourbon lurking in the background, definitely above average aroma strength but not overly aromatic.
T- Dark chocolate that is slightly on the bitter side, maple syrup, vanilla, light oak, some light creamy coffee on the finish. Overall nice balance although coffee maybe faded a little bit at this point.
M- Smooth, velvety, nice carbonation, very easy drinking.
O- This was a very good stout that lived up to expectations but is probably a little bit overrated. I never had this fresh but in my opinion comparing it to both the '12 KBS and '13 KBS (CBS outdates '12 KBS by ~4-5 months) it is falling off a little bit. Like the '12 KBS the coffee seemed to have faded a little bit and there was a little bit more bitterness to the chocolate then I was expecting which was similar to how the '12 KBS compared to the '13 KBS. Overall like the '13 KBS I think I might have enjoyed this a little bit more when it first came out. That being said it was still delicious and well worth seeking out. 1,511 charactersjaasen64, Apr 26, 2013

A - Dark Brown, zero light penetrates through, murky, light mocha head - pencil thin - small amount remains around rim for a few minutes.
S - Heavy maple, chocolate, vanilla, toffe, smoke, and a real boozy rum.
T - Initial: sweet maple, vanilla and toffee, Finish: is a mild roast, smoke and a bit boozy.
M - Full body, thick, Creamy, real frothy, high viscosity, touch of that elusive velvet. 
O - Tastes much better than the nose. Nose is way more boozy than I was expecting. Also, I think this is bit too sweet for me- simply too rich. Too much maple- almost taste a rum flavor. Love the smoothness, mouth is excellent but not is nice as KBS. 722 charactersweonfire, Apr 25, 2013

S- Maple barrels, oak, chocolate, toffee. Black liquorice is in the nose faintly as well.
T- The maple is definitely present. It is actually the first thing that I notice. Amazing what cellaring properly will do for a beer. Then there is this mix between black liquorice/ charred dark fruit/chocolate/toffee to round out the taste. 
M- I expected this to be thicker, it poured thicker than the M. It is about as thick as KBS, with minimal carb following
O- I am so glad to finally have tried this. I got this off of a guy who has some of the best cellaring techniques out there, so I knew I was going to get maple forward. Very happy to have tried this! 745 charactersgueuzedreg, Apr 20, 2013

In fact, I'm pretty sure all of the top 5 beers I've had have been from Redbird at this point. Big ups to him. CBS pours black with a finger of head that quickly drops down. The aroma is very sweet, with big bourbon notes shining through a dark fruit and roasted malt base. On the tongue, a smooth maltiness, vanilla, and dark fruit comes through first, then a bit of anise, chocolate, and the faintest hint of coffee on the middle that transitions gloriously to the thing that I can tell gives CBS it's reputation. That awesome, fantastic lingering maple and bourbon aftertaste. The mouthfeel is actually a little lighter than I would have expected. Overall - CBS wasn't my absolute favorite big stout - but I can forgive it, it's a little bit old at this point. It's still very delicious and worthy of the hype. 862 charactersshand, Apr 13, 2013

A- Pitch black, no light can pass through this monster. A finger of a mocha/kacki head.
S- Wow. Big vanilla, molasses, dark chocolate, coffee, some sweetness coming through
Taste- Exactly how it smells. Right up front you get a sweetness immediately cut with a roasted coffee bitterness. Big vanilla, molasses and dark chocolate notes. The roast and coffee come through later on.
O- I really don't know what more you can ask from a BA stout. This beer is absolutely amazing. By far the best beer I have ever had. 562 charactersjustyouraveragebeerguy, Feb 26, 2013

full body with low carbonation, a syrupy delight to enter your mouth.
i know this beer is hyped like all hell, and let me tell you, it IS all it's worked up to be. i've had fbs, and kbs, and this is nothing like either. i believe this is the best stout i've had to date. 702 charactersfacundoCNB, Feb 02, 2013

Appearance: Very dark, as expected, with a small tan head that quickly fades to the perimeter.
Smell: Rich chocolate, bourbon, caramel, maple syrup, brown sugar. 
Taste: Matches up perfectly to the nose. A hit of maple syrup gives way to chocolate and coffee deliciousness. A smack of bourbon hits afterward and lingers into the finish with some dark chocolate and carmelized sugar. Really drinkable for the abv, and blended really well. I just honestly don't see how you can improve on this. Alcohol is hidden really well, just tasty.
Mouthfeel: Perfect consistency for this style. It's just right, full and heavy without being extremely viscous.
Overall: Too bad I didn't get to taste this fresh. I've heard all the stories of faded maple, but I can definitely taste it throughout the course of the drink and that extra element makes me like this that much more. If it's even sweeter with more syrup character, I might like it even more. The bourbon dominates here, but that extra maple dimension adds to the complexity nicely. Well done. 1,052 charactersPsilohsaiBiN, Jan 27, 2013

Really thick pitch black pour with a one finger caramel colored head that fades quickly with great lacing. Huge complex woody nose. Tons of roasty coffee and maple up front along with plenty of dark chocolate and hints of bourbon, vanilla, and caramel. The taste is just as big and is also dominated by the sweet maple syrup, roasty coffee, and bourbon. Also getting hints of licorice, bitter chocolate, vanilla, molasses, caramel, and toffee. The mouthfeel is thick and syrupy with a subtle creaminess and a touch of booziness on the finish. Overall, this is just a tad bit too sweet for my taste. And it fell a little short of all the hype. Would love to try it fresh and see how it compares. Still an awesome beer from one of the best! 781 charactersbeerdrifter, Jan 20, 2013

T- the maple is subdued, coffee dominates the overall flavor profile, there are also some strong hints of dark chocolate.
M- thick and sticky. What more can you ask in a stout?
All in all I don't think it lives up to the hype. It's a great beer but the coffee really needs se subtlety. 399 charactersMalty_Matty, Jan 20, 2013

CBS is definitely on the sweeter side, the maple syrup bourbon barrels deliver that, but not overly sweet. Roasty coffee and chocolate balance out the palate.
Super hyped brew, but in this case - believe the hype. 354 charactersemsjf, Jan 08, 2013

The beer pours a jet black with almost no head. The nose is distinctly woody and sweet with a touch of bitter chocolate. I'm intrigued...the taste is a punch of distinct maple with a bit of licorice, chocolate, and roasty malts. I don't get the coffee as much as in a bottle of FBS. The mouthfeel is rich and flavorful, fudgy and slightly bitter, with a lingering roastiness. This is one of the most distinctly flavorful stouts I've had, but it doesn't pop with flavors as I'd expected. It's definitely a unique experience, but I'm not sure it's worth the tremendous hype trying to get a bottle unless it's re-released and consumed fresh. 778 charactersThePorterSorter, Jan 07, 2013

I would rather tuned up chocolate. Lots of true coffee, even the taste of creme (though I understand no real creme used). Very filling, the maple syrup seems added in.

T: Chocolate with roasted malt in the front, followed by some nice maple and slight bourbon taste. The maple wasn't as prominent as I thought it would be, but it was definitely still there.
M: The right amount of carbonation and very smooth. Enjoyable for sure.

A - Pours black with one finger brown head that dissipates at good pace. Lacing is minimal...
S - Chocolate, roasted malts, coffee, oak/vanilla, and bourbon. Maple is in the mix, but is fairly muted...
T - Chocolate, coffee, and roasted malts up front. Oak, vanilla, and bourbon on the end. Bourbon is very smooth, and the maple is just underwhelming. Chocolate comes across very nicely, but I was expecting more maple/ sweetness...
M - Rich and creamy with a decent amount of carboantion for the style. Sits somewhere on the lower end of the full bodied spectrum...
O - My least favorite of the BA beers we had at the blind tasting. Would have liked to see how this would have stacked up fresh...

Thanks to huskermike for this 1.
A- jet black with 1/2 finger mocha head. Appearance is great for the style. Cant wait to smell and drink this bad boy.
S- chocolate, coffee, roasted malt everything that makes big stouts amazing. Then throw in some maple and bourbon barrel notes just to add another level of awesome to it. 
T- Big chocolate, coffee, vanilla notes up front followed by roasted malt and more fresh coffee, chocolate and barrel character. The maple comes through to me in the end to really smooth everything out and rounds this stout out with the perfect finish.
O- "FEED ME MORE!!!" wow favorite stout to date (as of 8/26/12). I have had this beer on draft before at Armsby Abbey for stoutfest and didnt have the opportunity to review it. I had heard this beer might have fallen off a touch in the bottle, I disagree. This beer was as good as the first time I had it on draft. Amazing beer well worth the hype. I hope to land another 1 of these in the future. Maybe Founders will answer the call and find a way to remake this guy again. 1,130 charactersHopsHopenstein, Dec 02, 2012

5/5  rDev +8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Tapped at the brewery during their 15th Anniversary Party on 11-17-12. Most times, it runs out before everyone in the bar gets some, but not this time. It was on for around three hours...the first time. They brought it back again in the evening. Most people were ordering two and sometimes three glasses. I was able to enjoy four while enjoying the party.
Served in a snifter, which was held for a bit so it could warm up, it poured beautifully dark, rich, thick and with a great caramel colored head. 
After warming up a little, all the expected aromas of chocolate, coffee and vanilla were there though the maple sweetness was a little thin. 
The taste was just as I remembered. In my personal experience, the maple is the first flavor to fade. Expecting that, I wasn't let down that it was a little faint. All the other flavors reflected exacted what the nose displayed and was great swish after swish with an unbiting explosion of been too long flavor. 
Overall - like I said...I had four. 997 charactersTheBeerTruck, Nov 21, 2012

A: Didn't produce a ton of head room. Like most Founders Stouts, what it did have dissipated quickly and left a jet black glass of liquid. So dark it could black out the sun. 
S: A little too fresh during this tasting. Bourbon was way too present which easily overpowered almost all of the other notes. 
T: Heavy. Still torn on whether I prefer KBS over CBS. I've had KBS properly cellared and love the vanilla/sweet notes that come out and replace the bourbon. Unfortunately, this fresh, I felt that the bourbon was way too overpowering. The ale still had a wonderful taste and is definitely at the top of my favorite beers list. 
M: Thick, like having a full breakfast and enjoying a glass of bourbon. Once again, that fresh, I still wish I would have let it sit awhile. 
O: I've heard and read that it didn't age as well as expected. The KBS I've enjoyed the best has sit for 6-12 months before enjoying. Founders has sided against aging their beers as they feel they age them enough before release. Still, I feel this would have been knockout in between the said timeframe as it would have had opportunity to sweeten up and bourbon down. 1,170 characterskylelenk, Nov 06, 2012

World Wine and Liquor in Mentor Ohio during Cleveland Beer Week Broke out 1 of my Most anticipated big beers I have yet to try. Thank you Brendan. Unfortunatly only a 5oz. sample, Pours jet black with a fluffy brown head. Smell is largely like the Breakfast Stout or KBS, with dark malts, brown sugar, and coffee, with just a hint of maple. The maple really comes on more on the finish, balancing out the roasted malt and coffee for a memorable Beer. It’s a "Touch" too sweet, it’s not too bitter, But it is fantastic. 533 charactersbeergod1, Oct 27, 2012

Happy birthday to me!
A: No head. Just dark brown / black motor oil like body. 
S: Smells like KBS but sweeter. Coffee, dark chocolate, brown sugar, and unlike what many say, I still get maple syrup note. 
T: Delicious. Although I think I prefer KBS over this, CBS is basically smoother and sweeter KBS. Bitterness is there but it's balanced out by the syrupy sweetness. KBS is a sweet beer but compared to this, not so much. Bourbon, Coffee, dark chocolate, brown sugar, maple syrup/honey, tad bit of hoppy bitterness and alcohol notes towards the end. 
M: Surprisingly, carbonation is there (unlike how it looks). Thick, syrupy, chewy. 
O: This is definitely one of my top 10 beers, but I honestly slightly prefer KBS over this. Maybe I got lucky with my bottle, but maple aroma and taste was still there, although very subtle. 857 characterssukwonee, Oct 26, 2012

Pours jet black with a thick, slowly receding deep mocha head. Small patches of laces. 
Aromas of coffee, dark chocolate, maple syrup, vanilla and a hint of alcohol. A different blend each time I go back to smell it again. 
Wow! A smooth intense sweet blend of chocolate, coffee, bourbon, vanilla, maple, cherry pits, smokey wood, leather and of course some hot booze. A lot going on in here. 
Creamy thick full feel with medium light carbonation. Long bourbon coffee aftertaste. 
Despite the naysayers I firmly stand by my decision to hang on to this for a year. Yes, the maple syrup has faded but so has the bourbon and that allows all those other flavors to shine through. It also feels creamier and a little thicker. Rich, sweet, complex and outstanding. 872 charactersThickNStout, Oct 26, 2012

S - Aroma is maple syrup, Bourbon, vanilla, oak, roasted chocolate malts, roasted coffee, black licorice, lactose, a hint of dark fruit, and just a touch of booze.
T - Starts off with a mix of roasted milk chocolate malts, vanilla, black licorice, and a touch of dark fruit. Through the middle, roasted coffee comes through with some good maple syrup, Bourbon, and oak, and a bit of molasses. The finish is a mix of roasted milk chocolate, roasted coffee, maple syrup, Bourbon, vanilla, oak, molasses, and a bit of booze.
M - Full bodied with moderate carbonation. Feels smooth with a warming, sweet, and roasty finish.

Pours black, with a minimal brownish coloured head, no lace. 
The aroma was oak, vanilla, maple, touches of bourbon, sweet chocolate, hints of coffee roast.
Slighter bourbon-y notes on the taste, more maple, rich vanilla, woody notes, bittersweet chocolate, roasted coffee. 
Full bodied, thick, slightly viscous, with a rich feel. 
It's super drinkable. You can't get really any alcohol, and the maple sweetness balances out the bourbon notes, making it remarkably smooth but complex. This might not have been as good as it is fresh, but it's still a pretty remarkably wonderful beer. 609 charactersEgadBananas, Oct 05, 2012

Pours midnight black with no head to speak of. Aromas of caramel, booze, hot chocolate, and fresh coffee burst from the glass. Flavors of oak and whiskey dominate with a hint of stale coffee. The booziness is subdued after aging but for some reason I find it less drinkable compared to fresh offerings.
I've had this fresh out of a bottle and now aged in a keg. I prefer the fresher variety, though my scores would not move up much. All-in-all this is a great barrel-aged stout, but there are better examples of the style out there, including from Founders itself. 615 charactersJimsArcade, Oct 01, 2012

The aroma was loaded with fresh bourbon spiked coffee- lots of heavy roasted notes, and also a subtle woody sweetness of maple syrup. The flavor was also heavy on the coffee, just like the regular Breakfast Stout. Complimenting this was a smooth vanilla-maple sweetness, oat creaminess, and oak woodyness. The bourbon, coffee, and chocolate are so bold, that the maple really adds some nice depth and contrast. The mouthfeel was full-bodied and had light carbonation. Sweet, sticky, smooth heavenly viscus liquid. Damn. 631 charactersstoutluvr420, Sep 17, 2012

Served lightly chilled in an over sized wine glass. 
No visible bottle date.
A massive thanks to Futura123 for hooking me up with this huge want of mine! 
Appearance: CBS is one great looking imperial stout! The body looks pitch black in the glass, with a strong back light only revealing a hint of light along the edge of the glass. A rough pour yields a large, creamy, mocha coloured head that lasts really well for the Abv. and leaves some good patches of lace clinging to the upper parts of the glass. 
Smell: Ah man, this smells absolutely fantastic! The initial nose is all chocolate - cocoa dusted chocolate mousse, sweet dark chocolate and chocolate liqueur all come to mind. Soon a wonderful array of other notes join the chocolate. Sweet coffee, toffee, dark caramel, oak, bourbon, sweet maple syrup, a little vanilla, honey comb (the one in chocolates, not bee's wax) and light dark fruits are all easily noted. 
Taste: Wow and I thought the nose was good! The flavour takes all the notes from the nose and intensifies them, resulting in one of the most delicious beers I have had to date. The combination of chocolate, coffee, sweet maple and bourbon is absolutely mind blowing and each sip seems to be unique in its composition of those elements. Due to the complexity of the interactions of the flavour components I will simply list some of the observed flavours. Notes include: Sweet dark chocolate, cocoa, chocolate mousse, chocolate liqueur, dark caramel, sweet toffee, dark fruits, sweet maple syrup, oak, vanilla and a hint of liquorice. 
Mouthfeel: Full bodied and fairly sticky, with a medium level of wonderfully smooth carbonation. I usually prefer my imperial stouts to have a slightly lower level of carbonation, but on the plus side, it does make CBS fantastically (even dangerously) drinkable. 
Overall: CBS certainly lives up to the hype - this is a phenomenal imperial stout and one I wish I could have again and again. 1,979 charactersThehuntmaster, Aug 28, 2012

Appearance: Poured from a 750ml bottle into a large snifter. This beer comes out thick and black as midnight on a moonless night. If jostled, some reddish/amber light can be seen shining through the edges of the glass. Head is mocha colored, average in height, and recedes slowly.
Smell: Aroma is filled with roasted malt, dark chocolate, molasses, coffee, and some maple/caramel sweetness.
Taste: Wonderful blend of chocolate, coffee, molasses, maple, toffee, caramel, and a whisper of hops. Every element is perfectly joined with the whole. Just awesome.
Mouthfeel: Mouthfeel is full and really coats your mouth as you drink. Well balanced, with just the right amount of carbonation.
Overall: This beer lived up to my expectations and more. Very well balanced and just a tad more drinkable than the KBS version. I will seek this beer out whenever possible! 945 charactersBuckyFresh, Aug 23, 2012

A: Opaque black color with one finger of diminishing beige foam head. Light lacing remains on the glass.
S: Coffee is immediately evident, followed by reedy wood and intense vanilla. Coffee fades somewhat as the beer warms, replaced by dark and rustic grain. Some pure bourbon is also present, although the smell is only slightly boozy.
T: Begins off-dry, with aggressive carbonic acidity and dark chocolate. Flavors sweeten into the middle alongside potent anise that dominates the palate for a few beats. The finish begins to dry out, allowing for husky roasted malt and freshly-ground coffee to close the profile on an earthy and moderately bitter note. Hints of bourbon and vanilla linger on the palate, but essentially no alcohol is detected.
M: Thick viscosity, syrupy and slightly acidic on the palate, with moderate carbonation.
D/O: This beer exhibits powerful sensory qualities, even for an imperial stout. It is also a bit of a mess, although the end result is palatable. Founders KBS can be wildly inconsistent from bottle to bottle; this value-added rendition comes across as an average effort on the KBS scale--neither a disappointment nor a home run. 1,218 charactersbeagle75, Aug 03, 2012

Pours an inky jet black with edges of mahogany clarity. A finger of soft brown head swells and then recedes to a fine milky collar. Fantastic lacing and a bit of legging. 
Massive on the nose - bourbon is far more apparent than I was anticipating. Cocoa puffs, caramel, faint bitter coffee, rich sweet syrupy bits, more cocoa, molasses, maple, burnt wood, so incredibly complex. Not cluttered, just very intriguing.
Holy fuck. No wonder this thing was so hard to get. If I had any of this sitting in my basement, I can guarantee you that I wouldn't be giving any up. I can't dissect the flavors without first mentioning the perfect velvet consistency. That said, the flavors are monstrous and varied - the maple-y bourbon takes the lead, big cocoa, more simple syrup, a touch of black licorice, more booze than I had hoped for, vanilla, caramel, charred wood, milk chocolate. Likely the most complex beer that I've ever had. Delicious and challenging.
This beer is fantastic. I probably won't try to land another bottle as it cost me an arm and a leg, but I am very glad that I sprung for it just this once. Highly, highly recommended. And if you have the ammunition to land a bottle, fucking do it. 1,363 charactersyamar68, Jul 23, 2012

4.94/5  rDev +6.7%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Love this beer. One of the main reasons is that it is just so seamlessly integrated- no one flavor dominates, each element of the taste is smell seamlessly flows into the next and plays well together. The pour is black, with a thin head and lacing. Nothing special there, but nice enough. The aroma, however is lovely. Nuanced notes of vanilla, Bourbon, chocolate, and a finish of Maple syrup. Each aroma is noticeable, but it makes a whole greater than a sum of its parts. Sweet, yes, but also complex. The taste is equally enchanting. What strikes me most again, is that each flavor is layered with the others to make a delicious whole. This time, it starts off with a bourbon and maple hit, with the bourbon flavor growing and sharpening into the long finish. The last note you experience is a nice chocolate note that picks up where the bourbon leaves off. Silky smooth, this beer just disappears, only the complex flavors make you linger to contemplate.

A: Like motor oil with a huge head. The head stayed for ever and really didn’t fade all that much mostly just came off on my face.
S: bourbon and coffee with hints of chocolate yum.
T: Great, lots of bourbon followed by some coffee and chocolate notes. Some minor caramel and sweetness (which I assume is the maple syrup)
M: Lots of bourbon, and some sweetness when I drink down.
O: Good, but not living up to the expectation. Don’t get me wrong this beer is amazing but not worth the frenzy that it seems to have attained. It can’t hold a finger to bourbon county. I really expected more maple notes and they just weren't there. 701 characterscodysjb, Jul 02, 2012

I poured vigorously and got about ¼” of mocha head that slowly dissipated. There is some residual lacing throughout the entire time I was drinking this beer. I drank it in a blind taste with KBS and I was surprised by the amount of head compared to the bottle of KBS. Very nice aromas and the sweetness from the maple syrup shines through. I can’t taste the maple syrup but it is definitely sweeter than KBS. I was pleased with the amount of carbonation of this beer and overall it was very good. 558 charactersbvdubn, Jun 22, 2012

pours your standard imp. stout used motor oil black while yielding a 3/4" mocha-toned head that slowly fades to a lasting cap, leaving some nice patches of lacing. very nice appearance, particularly for a style where it can be hard to distinguish yourself.
in the nose, coffee explodes out of the gate; joined by secondary notes of chocolate, roasted malt, maple, and a touch of vanilla. not picking up much bourbon. very good, but far from transcendent. gives me pause: could the famed CBS amount to an overvalued let-down?
fortunately the answer here is a resounding no. taste exceeds the aroma by a fair margin, delivering rich, tasty flavors in spades. coffee, chocolate, roasted malt, vanilla, maple, toffee, and boubon... the more it warms the more these characteristics emerge. it's not a bourbon bomb - nothing along the line of BCBS or older viscosity - but even though i'm a bourbon fan this doesn't diminish my enjoyment of the beer. nice maple sweetness gives it a distinctive flair. smooth, velvety, medium-full bodied with medium carbonation.
overall i have to go A+ here. hype or no, IMO there's no denying this is just a delicious, flavorful beer. fantastic; if they ramp up the bourbon a bit (production numbers would also be nice) i think i'd have a serious contender for overall favorite beer. hell, i might have one anyway.

Cracked this bad boy on Saturday after the FW Invitational Beerfest
*22oz of goodness into a snifter
A: CBS pours a super dark, near black, color with just the tiniest browned edge to it. Looks plenty thick but not super viscous. Nice stack of finger thick mocha froth rimmed the top holding nicely and eventually falling to a halo leaving slippery sheets of lace with each sip. 
S: Smells of deep and rich roasted grain with some accompanying barrel notes. Vanilla and melted chocolate. A touch of smoky char roast coffee and some alcohol. Not heavy on the barreling but very nice and inviting.
T: Taste is just divinity. Sweet and roasty with toffee and a ton of chocolates. Gourmet roast coffee with vanilla cream. Can’t say that I am actually picking up a whole lot of maple but it does have a very distinct flavor to it. Sappy with some oak and highly bitter earthy hop levels. Insanely smooth and well integrated for such high ABV. All flavors accompany each other so well with not one really jumping out over the other. Just a phenomenal blend.
M: Thick and full bodied yet manageable. Not terribly heavy at all. Very creamy with a bit of lingering coat to the palate. 
D: An amazingly delicious Impy Stout…even with some age on it. Again I didn’t get much by way of Maple but everything comes together in unison. Will be on my tops list for sure. Def worth seeking out. So fortunate to have this opportunity. 
Only now I am burdened with tracking this one down every year. 1,525 charactersNugganooch, Jun 14, 2012

A: Pours black, oily with no head at all.
S: Smell is all about roasted malts, coffee flavors with hints of chocolate hiding behind.
T: Tasted is coffee, roasted and sweet malts. Maple syrup, vanilla and oak follow. No obvious bourbon, despite the sweet malts and vanilla notes. Aftertaste on sweet chocolate.
M: Mouthfeel is creamy, chewy but a bit lighter than expected. Overall, very drinkable.
O: A good and solid Imperial Stout. I'm a bit disappointed however because of the relative lack of complexity in this beer. I prefer KBS. 609 charactersFux, Jun 10, 2012

2011 bottle
A huge thanks to levon15 for sending over one of my top wants in a trade.
A: Pours a slightly viscous opaque black with some browning on the edges and one fingers width of dark mocha colored head which dissipates down fairly quickly to only whisps and an outer ring.  Leaves a small amount of patchy lacing.  
S: Bourbon, bakers chocolate, oak/wood, coffee, and only a subtle hint of maple syrup.  Very nice but not quite the strength of aromas I was hoping for.  
T: A really great tasting beer!  There is wonderful complexity and depth of flavors.  I get chocolate, roasted malt, bourbon (which is rather subtle in comparison to KBS), oak, hints of dark fruit and a big coffee on the backend along with some hop bitterness.  The coffee and cocoa linger forever in the aftertaste.  Initially I get almost no maple syrup/sweet syrup characteristics, but finally the maple syrup hits in the first couple sips of the second glass.  It comes in waves, not in every sip, but when it does it is oh so delicious and lingers forever in the aftertaste.  I wish it was more prevalent and it makes me wish I could try this somewhat fresh to see if theres a difference.  Either way though, really a fantastic tasting stout, up there with the best I've had.  
M/D: Wonderfully smooth with a very chewy mouthfeel.  Body is full and somewhat thick, carbonation is fairly high for the style but not negatively so.  The double digit ABV is nicely masked and drinkability is great for the style. 
O: No doubt this is a fantastic beer.  The aroma could be stronger but the palate profile is absolutely fantastic.   The maple syrup is much more subtle than I anticipated/hoped, and it seems the syrup aging in the barrel has mellowed out the bourbon characters and allowed more of the oak from the barrel aging to come out.  The degree of maple syrup is too subtle to make up for the subdued bourbon character present in the KBS, so I think I actually prefer the KBS.   That being said, KBS is one of my all time favorite beers so being slightly not as great as KBS is a huge compliment.   This is still fantastic and up there with the best stouts/beers I've had. 2,227 characterszac16125, Jun 04, 2012

Poured deep black with no light crossing any boundaries here. Off white head that lasted a few minutes before becoming a thin streak. Very nice aromas of burnt toast, caramel, toffee, roasty coffee and a bit of chocolate. Vanilla, cream, and the slightest hint of wood. It's quite good, but I hardly get any maple from it. In fact, it was a bit underwhelming. A decent body with appropriate carbonation, but a bit thin. I'm glad I was able to try this beer. 528 charactersDmanGTR, May 31, 2012

A: Pure black. 1/2" mocha head which stays fluffy throughout. Nice legs on the glass. No reason to dock points here. 
S: Chocolate, smoke, brown sugar, molasses, and espresso. Also quite enjoyable. 
T: Milk chocolate, maple syrup, vanilla, and caramel. Coconut is probably the dominant flavor, but it clashes with the maple syrup. Complex, but not my cup of beer. 
M: Full and excellent. No complaints here. 
O: I can see why people really enjoy this, but it doesn't really go beyond that level for me. Then again, I'm no fan of FBS, and I'm not a huge fan of KBS, so I was expecting to be nonplussed. So it was nice this is a very good beer, but it's not something I imagine I'd seek again. Founder's RIS reigns supreme, in my opinion. 781 charactersSarlacc83, May 27, 2012

Smell: At first it was a bit cold and I could barely get the smell out of it, but the more I let it warm up the stronger and stronger the bourbon scent becomes. You get a hint of coffee and chocolate as well, but once it is room temp it has one of the best smells ever.
Taste: First is the maple, very strong and forward, then coffee, then you get a great, much more subtle bourbon then the KBS I had today (should have tried them on diff days since was both first time for each) and then a bit of sweet again at the end. After it warmed up a bunch had a much stronger chocolate taste.
Mouthfeel: Very thick and creamy almost like a white russian, great for this beer
Overall: An amazing beer with amazing flavors, I would for sure get this one again. Glad I only shared it with my gf and gave her baby pours so I could have most of it :) 902 charactersBruceBruce, May 22, 2012

Taste in incredible, so much going on. Good thing I only split this with my wife because I love being able to have 2 big glasses of this one!!!!

5/5  rDev +8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5The last time I had CBS was a couple of years ago on tap, I recall it was excellent, but a smidge overpowering on the maple. 
However this 750 mL bottle I managed to acquire and have been holding for a few months now..this is an example of a phenomenal beer, and what an outstanding imperial stout. Sadly it was damn near impossible to get, lucky I suppose because I'd drink it like water.
It poured thick. Opaque brown-black maple syrup, very dark with a heavy rich brown head.
Smell is melding of bourbon wood, maple, faint sweetness, chocolate, and roasted malt.
Taste is outstanding in every way. So well balanced, yet big and bold. Bourbon, vanilla, maple, cocoa nibs, roasted dark malt, subtle undertones of roasted coffee and chocolate malt. Some warmth. A dash of sweetness. Subtle coffee and hop bitterness is hinted at and lingers in the background.
Mouthfeel is rich, robust, full-bodied, creamy.
Fanastic. You can set your bar for imperial stouts right here. Founder's knows how to brew a stouts...KBS..breakfast stout..imperial stout.. there is simply no argument here. In the CBS, maple and bourbon elements add layers of complexity to the already outstanding Founder's stout recipe without being overly sweet. Black gold. Holy grail. More please. 1,267 charactersJackieTH, May 21, 2012

M: well carbonated and fantasticly smooth still. Heavy body. 
O: not a super crazy beer by today's standards, but a well balanced beer. The coffee is certainly faded, so it's probably not going to age - I should have drank it already. 655 charactersHolland, May 19, 2012

Smell is really nice. Chocolate, maple, coffee, a little caramel-y smell. It's rich and sweet.
Taste is like the smell, but really emphasizing the sweet. The chocolate is really strong. The coffee and maple definitely seem faded. I tried this out of bottles in October, and it was much better balanced then. Maple has definitely faded. Giving a 4.5, but fresh it was probably a 5.
Mouthfeel is nice. Medium thick, really smooth, very light carbonation.
This is a really great beer. Very flavorful and rich, and at its best it had a lot of great complexity and balance. Now, it is still delicious, but I wish the coffee and maple were as strong as they were fresh. 726 charactersrodkin, May 13, 2012

This is THE Breakfast Stout! And we drank it accordingly.
Appearance: Looks damn near black. Looks oily when poured.
Smell: Large on coffee and chocolate to make up a sweet smell.
Taste: Sweet of syrup, but not too much. Coffee was creamy and blending in perfectly with the Chocolate. And smooth, yeas very smooth. Warmed the belly to help digest the Breakfast.
Mouthfeel: Silky smooth, mid carbonation. We let it sit for 15-20 mins to warm a bit and let the taste cry for us to sip!
Overall: Every last bit of what I was hoping for and have heard about. I will look forward to this beer again! Might make this a tradition. DLD and CBS! Does it get any better! 864 charactersCasedogg43, May 12, 2012

Beer pours black with an off-white head and very nice lacing. Smell is a great mix of coffee and maple with some oak as well. Bourbon really takes a back seat to the other smells, but it's really not missed. The flavor here has incredible balance - there's some bourbon, oak, chocolate, roast and maple all coming together fantastically. Compared to KBS, which I had earlier in the night, it's not quite as bourbon-y, but the maple comes through in a fantastic way. Mouthfeel is full-bodied and very smooth. Overall this beer is damn good. I swear it's tasted a bit different every time I've had it, but it's been great every time. This particular one has more maple than most. 781 charactersstarrdogg, May 12, 2012

A- Thin light tan sheet of head, dissipates quickly to a thin crown. Dark brown body, nearly black. No real lacing to speak of. Swirling gets nothing more than a crown.
S- Out the neck, tiny bit of oak, a little boozy, BIG chocolate. Once poured, slightly sweet, oak, bourbon. Also, a weird spicy/earthy aroma I can't describe. A little chocolate once warm.
T- Chocolate, oak, bourbon. Coffee & dark roasted grains linger in the aftertaste. Slightly sweet but can't really get any maple. A little boozy but pleasingly.
M- Warming, awesome mouthfeel. Creaminess builds in the mouth, coats well. Full mouthfeel. Medium carbonation.
O- Everything is pretty well in balance. Didn't smell as good as KBS but CBS wins on mouthfeel. 865 charactersVeristic, May 11, 2012

Pours a great viscous jet black color, hues of burgundy and mocha brown, nice head, fine retention, not a ton of lacing to speak off, could have been the glass. The aroma is fantastic, chocolate, oak, nice subtle maple, big coffee element, mild vanilla and only the faintest hint of bourbon. Wonderful flavors, nice vanilla presence pairs well with the chocolate and coffee, the maple isn't very apparent, but the bourbon catches up a bit from the nose, some alcohol is present but is in no way hot or abrasive. The body is great, coats the mouth very well, smooth, full, chewy, about everything you can ask for in a stout, nice warming as it goes down.
Verdict: Incredible stuff, definitely lives up to the reputation as one of the best stouts, and finest beers around. I'll have to track down a bottle of this for myself now! 957 characterskevanb, Apr 29, 2012

A- pours a pitch black with about a finger and a 1/2 light brown head.
S-bourbon, roasted malts
T- Immediately starts with roasted malt/chocolate-like taste. Ever slightly starts to move to the bitter dark chocolate of an imperial stout, before BAM, the maple syrup moves in for the kill. Provides an amazing, balanced sweetness that is not overpowering, but completely masks the beer's 10.6%. Finishes with some vanilla and the tiniest bit of heat from the bourbon barrels
M- chewy, creamy, thick, and everything a stout should be
O-hands down, the best beer I have ever had. This is now my third time trying it, and every time I do so, I am more certain in my belief. It's the most perfectly balanced beer I've enjoyed, and achieves everything it sets out to achieve. I find it hard to believe i'll ever find such an ambitious beer so well made ever again. 1,019 charactersNickyDee21, Apr 27, 2012

Being a huge imperial stout snob, I was so thrilled to receive a bottle of this stout as a Christmas gift. The appearance is very black, but when held to the light it appears a dark cocoa brown. When I sniffed, I immediately smelled dark chocolate and bourbon...which I expected. What I didn't expect was how smooth the taste was. I have had Founders KBS before and the bourbon taste/smell was very overwhelming...in a good way though. This tasted more like chocolate than anything else. I would highly recommend this stout to chocolate beer lovers and those who love their high quality stouts. Maybe for those more adventorous than I...enjoy it with some maple syrup covered bacon or sausage for breakfast. 749 charactershopstermonster1, Apr 26, 2012

4.4/5  rDev -5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Review #200!! The coveted CBS. 
A- Glugging out a bold black motor oil of a beer. The normal billowing head that develops in a Founders stout. This head can be described as a carbonated chocolate milk. Tons of webbed lacing all over the glass. 
S- Insane nose. Chocolate, cocoa nibs and vanilla, ever so subtle bourbon, and sweet maple syrup. The syrup is really on display. It adds a layer of sweetness even to the roasted malts. I cannot stop sniffing this. You could make an argument for coffee but it doesn't matter. The maple, chocolate vanilla and bourbon get me salivating profusely. 
T- DISCLAIMER: Let this beer become room temperature. In drinking it cold it had an off putting anise/black licorice flavor(unless you're into that). The flavor is coffee, chocolate, burnt malt, bourbon and sweet sweet maple syrup. The anise flavor dissipates quite a bit but still has a minor presence. There is a wooden presence from the barrel that seeps into the flavor profile as well. 
M- Mouth is milky smooth, with mid to high carbonation. For 10.6% abv there should be a lot more heat to this but hardly any. It drinks like a 6% beer. 
O- This beer is a prime example of how flavor can change based on temp. I change my review midway through and had this beer written off as a dissappinent first, thought I may have had a bad bottle even. Would love to try on tap. IMHO though, after having this, though awesome, KBS is better. 1,433 charactershaazer, Apr 25, 2012

Poured into a Snifter that looked quite well. Really dark with browish hints and a big mocha colored head. Looks mighty tasty! I was about to jump out of my skin from the hype train to try this beer!
Uhh... I thought this was aged in maple bourbon barrels?? I have had all the other maple BB aged beers at the brewpub and know what wonderful flavor comes from them, on lesser beer!! This was not even close. The only aroma I got after almost snorting this thing is MOCHA! Basically a mix of light coffee and chocolate. Not cool
The taste was the biggest let down. It was all over the place. Just a blended mess of chocolate, coffee, extreme sweetness, and a hint of wood and vanilla. I could not get any of the maple I got from all the other killer beers they have released before this one. It tasted like Mokah from Souther Tier, which is good-but easy as hell to find. 
Mouthfeel was solid and the carbonation was spot on for a stout.
Overall I was really disapointed from a beer I had been dying to try for years. I still have not had it on tap and can't wait to try. I adore Founders and will seek this out on tap to see if it changes my mind.
Edit-had it on tap and it was the same. Really wanted to like this, but O'well!!! 1,358 charactersJDizzle, Apr 21, 2012

A: So good! Pitch black with a super dark mocha colored head that fades at a decent pace. Yes!
S: Scent seems somewhat lighter than KBS. A mild creamy roastiness with some coffee blended in. Some vanillla and molasses towards the back. Decent.
T: Wow! This is KBS will an even better drinkability. You get a super creamy, sweet version of KBS. I get some sweet maple upfront with a phenomenal blend of vanilla, coffee, roastiness. Holy great stout! So much smoother than KBS.
M: Full bodied with a perfect carbonation. A sweet creamy finish. Very good.
O: All in all, this is a smoother version of KBS, as smooth as KBS is. Picture KBS with a heavier sweetness to it and a little more subdued on the roasty / coffee notes. Definitely try this if you love KBS, or just love sweet stouts. 875 characterssteve8robin, Apr 21, 2012

A: Pitch black, glupy, and resinous liquid pours into my snifter. At first a two finger rocky, bubbly head forms and recedes in a second. No lace, no retention. Pretty standard for a huge stout.
S: Bourbon, wood, charcoal, maple syrupy. Burnt acrid coffee. Milk chocolate. lots going on in the nose.
T: Again, lots going on here. Big bourbon and boozy flavors. Charred wood, burnt coffee, sticky sweet maple syrupy. A lot to get my head around.
M/D: A full body that is thick and resinous. Low carbonation and very sticky. Lots of alcohol for sure, and lots going on. One I have to take slow. Though overall a nice sipper.
I do like this, like everything else from Founders. Ultra complex, but ultimatly that seems like the downfall for me. To much going on for me to really sit back and enjoy. Very much in the realm of Black Tuesday and even Utopias. Like those beers, one I don't really crave that much. 1,003 characterschamp103, Apr 16, 2012

A: poured a thick dark coffee black into a founders snifter. A little finger of a mocha colored head to it.
S: Getting that coffee that reminds me so much of kbs. a little sweetness not so much maple though
T/M: right up front I get that coffee taste that I love. The flavors seem a little more mellow that kbs. I get some of that oaky qualities but i'm really stretching and I get none of the maple. It does have a lot smother finish and more mouthfeel than kbs and is more rounded.
O: I think I had this beer a little to late. It's a good beer but I wish I could of had it fresh off the tap when founders released it. I just don't see how it is the number 3 beer on here. It did not blow me away and It doesn't seem to hold up after time. This is one of those beers you need to have fresh or not at all. 832 charactersBrohamidAli, Apr 12, 2012

A-Appearance is black with a creamy tan layered filmy head that laces the glass.
S-Toasted barley malt, coffee, with a definite maple like sweetness. A rich aroam but not overpowering. Some vapory alcohol in the nose.
T-Reminds me of Breakfast stout with a lot more added flavors and sweetness. The added quality of a lingering maple sweet finish is very noticeable.
M-Just a hint of alcohol warming in the finish. Heavy bodied, lightly carbonated, quite creamy.
D-Not appropriate for more than sipping and savoring all that is going on in this beer.
O-Great complexity with a long non-bittering finish. This feels like a breakfast beer, would go great with a hearty breakfast or pairs well with dessert. This was a fun beer to try. 816 charactersdeebo, Apr 11, 2012

30 december 2011.
big ol' dark brown pour. beautiful dark tan head. full lace and a nice ring rim around the glass. looks very inviting. some swirls and she's foamed up. very delicate.
a conflation of bourbon, honey, not-so-rich maple syrup, molasses-y sugars, wood, vanilla, chocolate, coffee. it's a very pleasant aroma. i thought it might be bigger, but this is very pleasant.
now, i like the flavors involved, but i thought they'd be all mashed together. NOPE. truly, truly impressive. there is a subtle progression from chocolate to coffee to vanilla to bourbon to maple syrup. this is so nice, so subtle. booze is well hidden, more than well hidden actually, and none of the major flavors overpower each other. the nuances are excellent.
this is what makes this beer TRULY SPECIAL. the texture and consistency are otherworldly. it's velvety, silky even. it's smoother than any beer that i can think of. this is the experience of the beer. its subtlety is incomparable. i cannot get over this texture. it's half-and-half-like: thick, creamy, rich, fatty.
the impression of this beer is in its restraint, subtly. this could've been huge. most barrel aged imperial stouts tend to be huge and congested with flavors from the barrel and any combination of chocolate/coffee/oatmeal/vanilla. this beer not only contributes those flavors, but it features them rather than forcing them. but what makes this elite is the smoothness; it is unparalleled.
cheers. 1,493 characterspatm1986, Apr 08, 2012

4.3/5  rDev -7.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 411/25/11. 750mL bottle courtesy dfclav! Tasted alongside the regular BS and a KBS, both 12oz bottles also courtesy dfclav. Thanks, man! The pour is an opaque jet black with a small light brown head that cuts to a ringlet but sticks and laces a bit. The aroma is bold coffee followed by a touch of bourbon/alcohol, wood from the barrel, and a distinct sweetness... but I can’t say I’m getting tons of maple syrup. The difference between this and KBS for aroma seems to be that the bold woody vanilla aspect is replaced by sweetness. The flavor again packs a bold coffee punch at first, followed by loads of milk chocolate, a bit of ash, char, woodiness, and bourbon. The secondary flavors develop into chocolate milk, sweet maple syrup on pancakes, and lingering coffee and bourbon. Compared to KBS on flavor, there’s less of a bourbon punch as well as less of a roasted, bitter coffee punch. Smooth, velvety mouthfeel as always. All in all - pretty good shit! I’d say I still like BS the best, followed by KBS, then CBS. 1,028 charactersdrowland, Apr 06, 2012

4.75/5  rDev +2.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Very dark brown and black pour, pretty impressive head on it, given all the adjuncts/barrel usage, tends to leave a beer without much if any head/carbonation, but that's not the situation here.
Nice mild maple aroma, had just had koufax21's similar homebrew, that was very in your face (in a good way) with the maple and coffee, this one was excellent in its milder maple announcement to the nose, and the coffee was merely complimentary at best, but more akin to a lurker in the background. 
Taste, very solid. Take Founders awesome imperial stout, throw it in some cool ass maple and bourbon barrels, add some coffee I guess. For me, the coffee was really the only part of the beer I couldn't describe as perfect/near perfect really. Some nice added complexity from the caramel and vanilla undercurrent. The mouthfeel gets big nods for staying somewhat dry, yet so rich and full of flavor. Chocolate pretty helpful with its own delightful dark smooth addition, but also with eating up any alcohol on the taste buds. 
So ultimately an excellent beer, . . . but . . . is it better than Lawson's Maple Barrel? I don't think so. Unfortunately, I 'only' got to have 4-5oz of Lawson's, whereas I'll be drinking these for years to come, so its something I can kind of half assed revisit in terms of comparison. Plus, I have a bunch of real good homebrews that taste eerily similar to this beer. 1,392 charactersBeerandraiderfan, Apr 03, 2012

Jet black with a sudsy mocha head of a finger or so. Falls quietly to a slightly raised curtain.
Ultra snappy and distinctive coffee character which manifests in sharp green capsicum and herbal notes. Maple syrup, while mild, provides an additional lift. Behind is plenty of chocolate, dark fruits and brandy snap malts.
Tad more maple character in the flavours, alongside tar, caramelised dates, chocolate and muscovado sugar. Still bucketloads of that utterly distinct jalapeno-coffee action.
Creamy and decadent with moderate but unobtrusive carbonation.
Pretty difficult to find fault with, although I'd personally prefer the coffee to be wound back a notch with a corresponding increase in the maple syrup. Totally screams dessert beer. 791 charactersspicelab, Apr 03, 2012

A-- Poured a dark cola and settled black. One finger light brown head that stayed at film through drinking. Impressive looking beer and good lacing. Nice spotty lacing as went through this. 
S-- Coffee fading?? Really?? Tons of coffee in this. Lots of green pepper in this. Thought I was smelling a cab at some point. Big, bold coffee nose followed by waves of maple syrup, bourbon and more coffee. Impressive smell as so wine like in a lot of ways. 
T-- Hey, even more coffee. What a shocker. Waves of bourbon and maple syrup. Short lived waves as very dominated by coffee. Oppressive coffee taste at times. 
M-- Thick, rich, luscious and decedant. Just a solid beer. Low carbonation and full feel. Needed more bourbon and maple syrup feel. Mostly coffee and more coffee. 
O-- good but not brilliant. Overload on coffee in a big way. Lacks balance and needed more bourbon notes and maple syrup. Easy to drink even with the coffee harshness.

A - Pretty sinister to say the least. Pours basically black with a generous mocha head that is rich and thick. Good head retention with a slick film that coats the glass when drinking.
S - All of the goodness represented by KBS with not quite as sharp a bite, assumed from the sweetness of the maple. Choc, Bourbon, Coffee, and sweetness all layered into the profile.
T - Listen, it is a really good beer but this fits the Founders profile pretty consistently for me. That being, I tend to find that the bottle presentations fall off a bit when compared to the tap versions. For CBS, I did not really find this being noticeably different from KBS. The tap version seems to present the maple more forward, the bottle seemed to not present the maple in the flavor profile as much as the tap. All of the goodness is here, but I am not sure that I could distinguish this from KBS. I should have thought to do a side by side with KBS while drinking this to really ascertain. Rich choc, molasses, coffee, bourbon prominently featured.
M - Very rich and leaves a great oily sensation on the tongue. I found this to be the best aspect to this beer.
O - S0 happy to have had this compliments of Jason, but everything being said, I would be just as happy to more easily obtain a 4pack of KBS than lose your nuts chasing this. I would gladly have it over and over again, but will be sure to do a side by side with KBS next time to compare and contrast. 1,641 charactersBeerisheaven, Mar 31, 2012

Poured into a pilsner glass.
Appearance: A beer that is dark as night, with impressive head formation and lacing for a beer of its gravity and style, and a super thick appearance from the pour. 
Smell: I am picking up bits of cocoa and rich caramel/toffee notes. Rich notes of coffee waft through, though not all the time. I can also smell the alcohol as I take a big whiff. A very deep aroma which I can savor in its own right. 
Taste: This beer is truly one of the deepest, most complex beers I've ever tasted. The flavor is dominated by rich toffee and huge caramel flavors initially, but these soon give way to a delicate coffee taste that builds until the flavor of unsweetened dark cocoa nibs begins competing for attention. In addition to this, a rich, "dark" flavor underlies this all very subtly, and makes for a beer that is complex, thought-provoking, and downright delicious. I can't think of a beer that has opened up more with warmth and time than this one. Initially very sweet and super rich, but over time my palate adjusted or the beer hit its prime and this sweetness subsided, though the fullness and richness of the beer did not.
Mouthfeel: BY FAR THE MOST MEMORABLE MOUTHFEEL OF ANY BEER I'VE EVER HAD. That's enough said right there, but I'll go on. This beer is the thickest feeling beer I've had, but it's not overwhelming. It is a truly luxurious mouthfeel that everyone deserves to experience, but few will. If I could give this a 7.0 for mouthfeel, I would, because I truly think it deserves it. Wow!
Overall: I've already gushed over this beer, but need I go on? This is a beer that you will not soon forget. It is a truly memorable beer that is worth every penny. Though I'd take a FBS on a daily basis, it is because this beer is too special for daily consumption. it is meant for special occasions and memorable moments. I certainly will never forget the first time I had it. And I can only hope it won't be the last. Thank you Founders for your dedication to brewing excellence! 2,043 characterspBRale, Mar 28, 2012

Yep, that's right. I dare someone to call me on this. If there were ever a more perfect marriage of flavors it was surely not a beer. The combination of dark chocolate, bourbon, and maple syrup flavors produces feelings in my brain that only one other activity can. It is liquefied sex in a barrel. I had the distinct pleasure to enjoy it at the brewery so it was at its very finest and it is something I'll remember forever. Try this beer, find it and try it as soon as you can.

A - Black and opaque. Very clean looking as you only see black. Poured with a quarter inch mocha colored head that settled down to a thin rocky layer of foam that sits on top. Leaves some slight lacing on the side of the glass as you drink it.
S - Smells of chocolate, roasted coffee, brown sugar and maple syrup. There is also a slight oak presence that comes through. As I continue to drink this, I've noticed that its nose doesn't even come close to giving you a sense of how sweet the beer is.
T - Sweetness is the first flavor as I get maple syrup, brown sugar, melted butter, and vanilla. The sweetness is cut as more roasted coffee comes through that adds a nice roasted and slight bitter flavor that helps balance the beer. The finish is dry, bitter, roasted coffee flavors that linger on the tongue with hints of fresh vanilla mixing in. This is very sweet at first but manages to not be cloyingly or overly sweet as it has those nice coffee notes on the backend. Reminds me of eating pancakes and then sipping some high qualtiy coffee. Definitely the most distinctive taste of any of the breakfast stout line up. 
MF - The mouthfeel goes perfectly with the flavors of the beer. It isn't too heavy but has great stickiness to it that just matches the maple syrup flavors perfectly. I almost feel like I have some maple syrup left on my mouth from breakfast. In my opinion it helps the flavors linger on. It thins out at the right time and leaves a nice slight astringent feeling that lingers on in the finish.
O - This is the Founders beer that is the hardest for me to decide on how I feel about it. Is it good? yes. If I had to choose between only having this or KBS for the rest of my life, I'd probably take KBS. It is also definitely one of the most unique flavor profiles I've ever had in a beer. The syrup and vanilla are definitely present and add a unique complexity to the beer. 1,959 charactersjeonseh, Mar 24, 2012

4.35/5  rDev -6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Well...hello there old friend. It has been awhile. Poured this time from a bottle into a snifter. The brew appears black in color with a brown head that is more than a finger strong. A full wall of webby lacing sticks to the glass. Faint brown clarity is seen through the edges.
The smell is sweet with chocolate, musty coffee, and a dark sweetness of molasses. Very pleasant and roasty with a well rounded character all about it. My only gripe is the coffee scent inclusion does not offer up and brightness or freshness. Instead it is a bit dull and earthy with that stale mustiness of left over coffee quality.
The taste is super pleasant with a smooth, sweet chocolate flavor. Notes of cocoa blend into roasted coffee, molasses sweetness and a hint of fruity alcohol. This brew is modestly bitter and roasty but very well balanced with all the flavor contributions perfectly blending together and not clashing or fighting for attention at all.
This is a medium bodied brew with a smooth feel that is modestly carbonated. Awesome arrangement of flavor. This is super easy drinking, I would have it regularly if that was possible. I would of had zero issues killing the entire bottle and looking for more. 1,209 charactersstakem, Mar 23, 2012

Appearance : black as can be and pours like motor oil. A very nice dark tan head appears after a vigorous pour that dissipates to a ring of bubbles. Some very nice lacing clings to my sniffter.
Smell : Lots of roasty carmel malts.Dark bakers chocolat and subtle bourbon and vanilla aromas fill my nose. Also some subtle expresso notes and sweetness.
Taste : In a word- heavenly .This beer coats your mouth in a complex synergy of flavors. Lots of roasty carmel malts, vanilla, dark chocolate, expresso beans and a pleasant sweetness which I'm guessing is from the maple barrels. Very subtle dry wood tanins on the finish. I really taste the bourbon late after I exhale.
Mouthfeel : Full bodied brew that coats your mouth. Mild carbonation with a pleasant viscosity.
Overall : I really respect Founders and there beer. This beer delivers the goods and really lives up to the hype. Very well done bourbon aged brew. 958 charactersBUNZILLA, Mar 20, 2012

A: Pours a dark black with a slight ruby tinge when held up to the light. Small tan colored head that had minimal retention and spotty lacing. 
S: Some coffee and roasted malt mixed with some chocolate. There is a little maple sweetness and hints of bourbon and vanilla. 
T: Light sweetness upfront along with some maple, more coffee, roast and chocolate. There are undertones of bourbon, vanilla, and a little caramel. 
M: Medium to full bodied with moderate carbonation. Very easy drinking. 
O: A really good beer, one of the best I have had, but I think I prefer KBS which we consume side by side. I was hoping that the maple would come through a little stronger, but still a great beer nonetheless. 767 charactersmdaschaf, Mar 14, 2012

4.7/5  rDev +1.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Enjoyed on-tap @ The Royale for "Stout Night" in St. Louis, MO for $7. Tapped from the Founder's Tap Handle w/ a Canadian Park Ranger in a Red Jacket on the top into a 12oz Snifter Glass.
This was a 2011 Vintage. 
Aroma- Very boozy and filled with bourbon. Dark Chocolate hits the nose as well and is closest to perfection on the nose for this style.
Appearance- Received with a .5 finger, bubbly head that dies quick. Has a viscous, deep looking body and brown. Leaves sudsy lacing behind. 
Flavor- Very close to the aroma! Has a nice dark chocolate/light espresso body with a heaping amount of sweetness. Bourbon is big once again in the flavor and finishes with a full bitterness level.
Mouthfeel- Medium-Full Bodied, Lightest Carbonation, Bourbon background and finishes with strong sweetness.
Overall Impression- Very happy I got to enjoy this one on tap! Not as much maple syrup as I found in the bottle version but still an AWESOME 2x Stout! Would recommend finding this on-tap if you get a chance. 1,010 charactersDCon, Mar 13, 2012

S-The maple is pretty prominent in the aroma, freaking amazing! Balances out the strong bourbon alcohol presence. 
T-There is a nice roasted coffee presence, accompanied by some chocolate malt, toffee maybe, caramel and a healthy dose of bourbon and the amazing maple flavor! The high ABV is extremely well masked with the strong bourbon presence. All of the other roasty and malty flavors are balanced out by this sweet maple, molasses-like syrupy texture. 
M-The mouthfeel of this beer is silky smooth due to the additional aging in the maple barrels. 
O-This beers is ridiculously quaffable considering all that’s going on and the high alcohol content. As mentioned above, there are a lot of complex flavors going on here. Nice big roasty coffee presence, chocolate, malts, oatmeal, and a very nice bourbon presence all wonderfully balanced by the sweet maple syrup flavor coming from the additional aging. I could drink this beer all day and I’m going to pursue this beer all day so that I can try it again soon. 1,245 charactersmtbdonn, Mar 12, 2012

4.07/5  rDev -12.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Shared by ejyoung, the man, the myth, the legend. Poured into a tulip. 
Inky in both color and consistency, the beer glugs out of the bottle dark and foreboding. It gives up maroon at the very edges, but for the most part it’s opaque. A thin layer of sandy tan foam emerges as I pour.
Great nose. Sweet cocoa, oak, vanilla, oats, a little toffee and old coffee. Maple is in there as well, but it’s pretty subdued. Still — sweet, complex, and nice.
There’s a little more of the acrid old-coffee flavor, which is a little off-putting. Oak is huge, delivering toasted vanilla a butterscotch notes next to milk chocolate and just a little maple. Alcohol is noticeable here, as is a big roasty note.
It’s thinner than it looks, maybe medium-light in body. Carbonation is gentle, but alcohol isn’t — I get quite a bit of heat in both the nose and on the tongue.
Ejyoung said he can’t get past the flavor of black jelly beans; ottovon said it’s thinner and less maple-heavy than he remembers; I think there’s too much of that acrid coffee flavor. Bottom line: it’s not world-class, at least at this point. Has the maple dropped off that much? I still think it’s a very solid brew, but lacking the special qualities that inspired people to give up so much for it. 1,284 charactersPhelps, Mar 11, 2012

Appearance. Pours thick and black as night with a thin brown head that doesn't last long. 
Smell. Bourbon and sweet, roasty malt, a little vanilla and a bit of old wet wood with a hint of real maple syrup.
Taste. Roasty malt, dark chocolate, vanilla, some woody bourbon and a little booze. Just a light hint of maple.
Mouthfeel. Full body with smooth, low carbonation.
Overall. A very nice sipper. A little more maple would be welcome.

A- Pours black with a half-finger of creamy mocha brown head that dissipates down to a thin layer, leaves pretty good lacing.
S- Loads of chocolate and roasted malt, coffee, big notes of vanilla and barrel character, soft maple aroma, bourbon aroma itself is mild and not harshly boozy.
T- Follows the nose pretty closely, mildly roasted malts provide great coffee and chocolate flavors, no astringency or char, vanilla, a light maple flavor and a well-integrated bourbon all blend together, the beer is overall on the sweet side, booziness is light but provides some nice warmth. 
M- Full-bodied, smooth and very creamy, carbonation is low but the beer doesn't feel overly oily or viscous, pretty spot-on.
O- Easily one of the best beer's I've ever had, the flavors are excellent, subtle and well-blended, this beer is unbelievable, seriously is there anything Founders can't do? 998 charactersWillCarrera, Mar 09, 2012

A: Pitch black with a finger of frothy, tan head. Great head retention, and nice lacing. This is a temptress.
S: A lot of chocolate and vanilla. Hints of maple, oak, and bourbon. From memory, the maple smell was more present in the draft version. However, this is also a few months old.
T: Chocolate and maple dominate with hints of bourbon on the back end. Some booze in there as well. The flavors all blend together perfectly. Much like the nose, I seem to remember the maple being more present in the draft version. However, this is still wonderful. Very dessert-like.
M: Smooth, creamy, and just the right amount of carbonation. Loving how this is going down.
O: This is every bit as good as KBS. On draft, there are times where I think it is better. The maple is much more subtle in the bottled version. Again, it could be the age of the bottle. Regardless, there is no doubt that this is a world class barrel-aged imperial stout. Founders knocks another one out of the park. 1,124 characterstravMI13, Mar 03, 2012

Aroma is caramel, molasses, and heavy coffee, with vanilla and slight hints of oak and maple. Chocolate malt and bourbon provide a consistent background. Smoky, fruity chili comes out late.
Roast malt, vanilla, and chocolate carry the flavor profile, with an almost minty sweet maple flavor throughout. The finish is slightly bitter coffee. Bourbon is evident in flavors of oak and vanilla but not overwhelmingly boozy. Dark fruits...bruised plums, figs, come to play as it warms. An almost ancho chili-like flavor emerges...smoky and peppery.
Body is fairly heavy, syrupy with little carbonation, and a slightly alcoholic warmth.
Overall, a bit sweet for my palate, but very complex. 889 charactersbarczar, Feb 29, 2012

A: Pours a thick black color like motor oil, lets no light through; no head, light lacing
S: Smells exactly like sticking your nose in one of those bags of chocolate-covered coffee beans from Starbucks. Rich milk chocolate and roasted coffee notes pervade every corner of your nose.
T: Thick chocolate syrup flavor and a nice roasty coffee background up front; finishes with a great espresso-y bitterness that lingers for awhile. Just savoring that bitter coffee taste on the back of my tongue between sips was a delight in and of itself. 
M: Thick and viscous, rich and velvety; EXACTLY what I want in an imperial stout.
O: This is the best beer I've ever had in my life, it literally embodies everything that I could want not only in a stout, but in a beer period. I scoffed at the ridiculous trade value of this brew and its hyper-inflated price on the bay, but now that I've had it I can see why. Believe the hype. 1,021 charactersJules11788, Feb 28, 2012

A - Typical stout black with a very nice dark brown head, dense, that almost lasts for the entire pint.
S - Very aromatic with flavors of lightly bittering coffee, semi-sweet chocolate and raw syrup. There's a hint of roasted malts in the background but the "extra" ingredients shine through in the aroma.
F - Follows the smell but the main flavor for my was coffee and then chocolate. The maple flavors hit quickly with a sharp contrast bring a lot of sweetness to the palate. In the background is a nice robust stout flavor but without the dryness.
M/O - Very big body with just the right amount of carbonation. Very easy to drink despite the high ABV (not detectable to me). It's a little sweet-forward to me for an imperial stout but that doesn't mean it's not a fantastic beer. Glad I have more to share in the future! 881 charactersVaTechHopHead, Feb 27, 2012

I thought there might be some more direct Bourbon smell but the light vanilla is about all. The taste is again very much like year old fbs (which I just recently had). It has a solid coffee flavor but the Bourbon is maybe non existent and the maple is very, very light. I'm not even positive its maple... just a sweetness frankly. Has nice vanilla and caramel flavors. Full moutfeel that hits the spot.
Overall this beer is good to very good but not mind blowing. Maybe the maple faded too much and its better fresh. It has some nice complexities but not in the super top tier for me. 672 charactersbpgpitt10, Feb 22, 2012

The maple syrup is more noticeable as the beer warms. Finishes slightly bitter with some black licorice. Mouthfeel is full-bodied with a syrupy finish. This is a big beer with ABV well-hidden.

This beer has everything going for it. The appearance is classic stout with the smell actually making you want to chug the beer. There were hint of sweetness to the aroma, and i assume that has to do with the maple that permeates the beer? 
The taste is surprisingly wonderful. I have already loved the KBS, and this is no exception. You can taste a hint of maple to supplement the traditional imperial stout flavor profile. It certainly helped that the alcohol was not blatantly present. 
I did not realize that this beer had 10.6% ABV, and you wouldn't know it when drinking. The mouthfeel was more smooth than a baby's ass, for lack of better analogy. It was unbelievable, and it's certainly one of the best stouts I've tasted in a long time. 791 characters2xHops, Feb 19, 2012

Appearance: Deep dark black in color. Opaque. Medium brown head that remains. Looks very appealing.
Smell: Aroma is layered. I can discern the maple syrup, coffee, chocolate, vanilla, and caramel. One can tell there’s a lot going on with this beer. 
Taste: WOW!! were the first words from 3 of the 4 people that were sharing this. We had all heard the hype but weren’t really prepared for what hit our palettes. First was the maple syrup, next the coffee and the list goes on.
Mouthfeel: Smooth and creamy. Slight mouth coating in a good way.
Overall: The bottle went in a flash. With a party of 4 we could have easily went through a couple of these. It left you wanting more. It was hard to restrain myself and sip and savor. This is definitely one beer that lives up to the hype. I’ve tried Dark Lord, The Abyss, KBS, Breakfast Stout, AleSmith Speedway Stout, as well as several others and I have to say this ranks high in my top 5. 1,015 charactersheysuz, Feb 15, 2012

A - Coffee coca cola color. Very little head, larger bubbles around edges. A little oily but not too thick. Ring of bubbles around the edges and clouds across top.
S - Not crazy intense. Definitely get chocolate and some maple/brown sugar. As it warms up it releases a more complex array of aromas. My brother pointed out that it smells a bit like centipedes... he was spot on.
T - Whoa, a lot going on. I get a hit of chocolate and maple syrup first. Still some hoppiness and alcohol in the middle, smooth as can be. Ends with a ton of coffee. Really sweet. So close to the sickly sweet line, but not crossing it! Definitely a dessert drink. 
M - This is great. Maybe saves the drink for me. Great amount of carbonation and super smooth.
O - Really good. A bit on the sweet side, but super smooth and complex. There were a lot of flavors that I couldn't quite place in the middle, but I loved the coffee domination at the end. 957 charactersdlello2, Feb 12, 2012

They served it a bit chilled and so the nose was very faint, but I didn't have the patience to wait for it to warm before drinking it (otherwise, the smell score could have been higher). I did detect notes of vanilla and espresso beans. It smells like creme brulee (the dessert, not the beer from ST)
The flavor is simply off the charts. There's a tiny bit of vanilla sweetness on the front of your tongue, then at mid-palate it turns into the richest, darkest, most delicious bittersweet chocolate cake you've ever had in your life. They should call this stuff Viennese Breakfast Stout. Besides the vanilla and dark chocolate, I was getting really quality coffee notes, hazelnut, and a very faint fruity tint underneath it. Kind of like cherry. There is no, and I mean NO, alcohol burn at all. It is sweet and smooth, the mouthfeel is perfectly firm and creamy, and the beer is unbelievably drinkable. It took every bit of discipline I had to force myself to sip it and not just take huge gulps of it.
I love barrel-aged beers and I'm not aware of anyone who does it better than Founders. How can I best summarize what it's like to drink this beer? As I was walking back to my car, I was thinking to myself ``If I die on the way home tonight, I will take solace in the fact that this was the last beer I ever drank.'' 1,534 charactersdeadonhisfeet, Feb 10, 2012

Pours thick and black like motor oil with a creamy tan head that sticks around for a while before attaching to my -stache. Smells of coffee and chocolate mostly with bits of earthy hops in there that try in vain to balance the sweetness on this bad boy. The maple aroma is very subtle but there. I pick up little to no barrel aromas. Taste is sweet with tons of coffee chocolate and caramel malts with again faint maple and some earthy spicy hops trying to cut through the sweetness. Thick body with a sweet creamy silky smooth mouthfeel and a light level of carbonation. This is a great beer, but the maple seems very subtle. I remember having this a couple of years ago and thinking it was over mapled. If it didn't cost my first born and require swapping spit with the beer store guy I'd add a few of these to my basement. 864 charactersjohnnnniee, Feb 09, 2012

More time drinking this beer helped me realize how cluttered its flavor profile really is. Extreme amounts of coffee and malt sweetness absolutely overpower everything else. The maple is here but isn't blended well into the mixture. CBS screams "Imbalance!" at my palate when I drink it these days.
Don't get me wrong: this is a very good beer -- one I enjoy quite a bit -- but it is simply not on par with the other elite imperial stouts. Brews like Hunahpu's, Dark Lord '10 (not '11), BCBCS, and Darkness all outclass CBS.
And here's the kicker: the last few times I drank CBS, I kept wishing it were Breakfast Stout instead. If nothing else, CBS helped me appreciate how stellar FBS is. But obviously, YMMV. Cheers! 915 charactersbrystmar, Feb 07, 2012

The appearance is black as night, motor oil comes to mind, tan mocha colored head that fades away quickly. The smell is BIG on coffee and oak, hints of bourbon and chocolate, don't get too much maple that I expected. Tastes just like it smells, but with a bit more of the oak and bourbon characters. This is a big beer for sure. Very similar to KBS in my opinion. There is a slight hint of the maple sweetness at the end of the taste, the alcohol is very well hidden (drank this bottle to myself.) Mouthfeel is thick and creamy, just as expected. Perfect carbonation for the beer. Overall, I wish I had this on tap first, so I could have done a comparison of the two. Either way, this is a HUGE beer and if you're able to land a bottle, crack it open and enjoy. It's definitely a beer worth trying, currently crossing this off my bucket list. 941 charactersHoppedup616, Feb 07, 2012

From a 750 ml bottle. 
I've had this beer twice prior to writing this review - once on tap and once from a 750 that I shared with coworkers. I must admit that I was underwhelmed on both occasions. We'll see what a closer look reveals.
A. Black as a starless night with a nice dark tan to light brown head of three fingers. The head never totally disappears even with only a sip left in my glass.
S. Bourbon barrel notes, cola (lots of it too), licorice (Good & Plenty candy comes to mind) and maple if I really take a deep sniff. Pretty sweet smelling but in a very nice way. 
T. Wow, what a mouthful of complex flavors. Licorice and bourbon flavors start things off. Secondary flavors of vanilla, dark roasted coffee and maple follow. There is some nice bitterness on the back end - herbal in nature - to help clean things up and provide a lingering aftertaste. Pretty amazing stuff. 
M. Really coats the mouth in a thick, almost syrupy fashion. These heavy, full bodied beers are fun to drink at first but get tiring quickly to enjoy other than in small amounts. CBS is no different in this category. 
O. Having this beer on a clean palate has given me a better understanding of it and I must say I am impressed. It is massive in both flavor and mouthfeel. That said, a small amount (5 or 6 ounces) is plenty for me in one sitting. Is it worth the $15 I paid for it? Yup, but I really have no need to revisit this beer anytime soon. Glad to have tried it but now please, pass me a FBS or FIS. 1,541 charactersbound4er, Feb 05, 2012

12 oz pour into a tulip
A: Inky oily jet black body with a creamy, frothy brown head. The dissipation was somewhat slow, but it left huge amount of lacing and a wonderful cap behind. It doesn't really get much better looking than this for the style.
S: Maple syrup, fresh coffee beans, chocolate, caramel, vanilla and some hints of smoke towards the back end. There's an overall sweetness to the nose that brings all the flavors together quite well. Very nice.
T: Lots of maple syrup up-front, along with plenty of bakers chocolate and coffee. There's a oatmeal-like quality that comes through midway. Vanilla and oak towards the back end, with more sweet maple rounding everything out. This drinks so easy and it's incredibly complex; I loved every sip of it.
M: Smooth and creamy with just the right amount of carbonation. Full-bodied and hearty, this is how I want my Imperial Stouts to feel. A bit sticky in its coating.
I also had the 2010 vintage on-tap at the same time. It was good but lost a lot of the maple syrup flavors I thought made the 2011 standout. A wonderful beer made incredibly well, believe the numbers this one is killer. 1,162 charactersShanePB, Feb 05, 2012

Oily, almost black pour. Nice molasses brown highlights in the stream. My snifter retains a decent inch plus of deep brown head. Minimal lacing. Decadent.
Richly sweet aromas, similar to Breakfast Stout. Huge chocolate notes with a fluttering soft bourbon note that is perfectly centered. Lovely vanilla, sweet alcohol; hints of maple, oak, and cookie dough.
Incredible first hit of flavors: bourbon, milk chocolate, nougat, candy-coated licorice candies, nice load of maple syrup. Some heavy cream and caramel, sugar-dusted blackberries, lots of delicious sweet desserty flavors. Cola, vanilla, oak barrel, and a heavy-duty grain bill. Sweet finish with the alcohol warmth showing. Pockets of bitterness in the pouches of my back palate.
Full-bodied, silky-smooth, elegant feel. A little bit of suds scrubs a bit, but the carbonation is subdued. Drinks in the way that chocolate mousse eats. Pretty remarkable.
An unreal drink. So powerful and sweet. What is amazing about this beer is that all of the decadently sweet, desserty flavors are never cloying, tiring, overdone, obvious, misrepresented, or off, in any way. This is, very seriously, a treat. All of these ridiculous sweet-tooth flavors are gently wrapped up and showcased in a seriously manly brew. All I can say is that I should have bought the other bottle when I had the chance. CBS is big-time awesome! Score one and savor the flavor! 1,562 charactersthecheapies, Feb 04, 2012

Smell: Bourbon, chocolate and coffee
Taste: Bourbon, chocolate, coffee and maple syrup.
Mouthfeel: Good carbonation, slight coarse and a medium dry finish.
Overall: Very well done brew. I was expecting more maple syrup in the taste. I didn't get any maple from the aroma. Did this with a side by side with KBS and FBS. All 3 are fantastic brews and are always wanted. Cheers. 487 charactersHeatwave33, Feb 04, 2012

Smell: Oh my Jebus. This ain't no folgers but I bet it would have all of America waking up in the morning. It smells phenomenal. Coffee, mocha, maple syrup, and might as well add bacon and pancakes to it too. It's incredible.
Taste: Coffee, coffee, and more coffee, but good coffee. Maple syrup in the finish that gives the beer a great balance between maple sweetness and coffee bitterness. The sweetness tastes a little bit like caramel too. Amazing flavors throughout.
Mouthfeel: I need to make myself sip this beer because I want to gulp it. A thick, syrupy body that sticks to your mouth and palette. Helps enjoy the beer even more.
Overall: Amazing stout. Almost perfect. Breakfast of champions. Canadian Bacon Stout. It's just ridiculously good. 918 charactersnmbr0ne, Feb 03, 2012

4.7/5  rDev +1.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 5New Years Eve was Founders night. The Big Dooper and I were able to scrape up a killer Founders stout lineup for the festivities. FBS, KBS, CBS and FIS were all enjoyed, in that order. Really glad to have had the chance to try all of these at once, and very happy to get a shot at this one. Thanks to everyone who made this beer night possible! 
From a 750ml into a snifter
Drunk after FBS and KBS 
APPEARANCE: A black, almost sludgy looking pour makes a two finger, thicker looking, fluffy, light mocha head with very good retention. Thick, jet black body with zero carbonation evident. Head slowly fades to a good full wisp and sticks to the top of the glass. A ring and splotchy wisp remain until the end and leave some good lacing the whole way down. 
SMELL: Barrel is there, with bourbon, oak and some notes of vanilla, but the maple syrup is the star of the show and makes this beer unique among its peers. Some sweet caramel and light dark chocolate notes are there as well, but the barrel and especially the maple syrup make this brew what it is. 
TASTE: This really is the shit. Some roasted notes up from with caramel and sweet maple syrup through the middle into a bourbon barrel finish. Bourbon, oak and vanilla notes on the swallow, moving into a big, long and lingering aftertaste of bourbon barrel, maple syrup and some bitter, dark chocolate and espresso notes from the base beer which balance the syrupy sweetness nicely. Very complex and flavorful after the swallow. This is world class stuff. 
PALATE: Medium body and medium carbonation. Semi creamy enough on the palate, enough weight, goes down fine with a bit of a bourbon burn at the swallow and finishes relatively sticky. Some heat lingers. Creamy enough and smoothened out some as it sat in the glass. 
OVERALL: This beer is definitely worth the price of admission, as are all of Founder’s imperial stout brews. Whether this one is better than KBS is a matter of personal taste, as both brews are complete works of art. This one is definitely a masterpiece, with a menacing pour, a big, complex nose and a taste profile to write home about. The maple syrup was done unbelievably well, meshing seamlessly with the bourbon barrel and the base beer. Very glad to have had the chance at this one and would absolutely love to drink it again. Thanks again to everyone who made this Founders lineup possible. This was outstanding! 2,407 charactersJeffo, Feb 01, 2012

A - pitch black, very little to no head. What little head there is, comes in tan and sticks around to the glass for a while. I expected this, and fully understand why there is little head with this sort of barrel aging.
S - Coffee stands out. Sweet dark malts, moderate roast. As it warms, I just get more roasted coffee.
T - Wow. A nice big sweetness hits the tongue immediately, It's sweet milk chocolate that overtakes the palette, then the maple swoops in in an impressive manner. Vanilla, tiny tint of anise, and then the bourbon hits as it's going down. Impressive how all of the flavors stand out, but harmonize to finish so cleanly. 
M - A medium to thick mouthfeel. Creamy, Silky, and great for the style. Carbonation is right where it should be to accentuate the flavors in this style (little carbonation). 
O - Did I say Wow yet? Wow. This is a fantastic brew! An array of sweet malt flavors combine with toasty coffee and maple syrup, and then takes a bourbony turn in the finish. Vanilla throughout, a little heat, and I am in heaven. Its almost like choicolate milk with a kick... But it's so much more! I would definitely seek this out again! I would recommend drinking this soon, only because I feel that everything is in perfect balance at this very moment, 1,419 charactersactone2001, Jan 28, 2012

750ml bottle poured into a snifter. 
A- Pours a motor oil black color with a thin brown head that leaves great lacing. The carbonation doesn't seem too vibrant as the heads fades down. 
S- The most prominent aroma would definitely be coffee...lots and lots of coffee. Deep roasted scents with some bourbon and vanilla present as well. The maple is way in the background but it adds a nice touch to the overall aroma. 
T- Now the maple shows itself! Waves of coffee and bourbon initially with an incredibly sweet maple syrup and milk chocolate finish. Vanilla, anise, black coffee, oak, and alcohol. If I try I can pick out each flavor individually but overall they all meld together nicely into a truly delicious brew. The 10.6% ABV is very well hidden and is only noticeable with a touch of heat in the finish. 
M- Silky smooth with medium/low carbonation, perfect for the style. Creamy texture without being cloying. 
O- Easy to see why this is rated so highly. Going into this I almost thought that all the flavors would clash (chocolate, coffee, maple syrup, bourbon)...seems like it would be easy for this to taste muddled. Thankfully that was not the case. Founders made a truly special brew. 1,276 charactersprojectflam86, Jan 26, 2012

 Smells delicious! Maple (especially strong when sampled with KBS on the side), chocolate, and the aroma of coffee beans being ground. Masterful!
 Tastes acidic and sweet, with pronounced notes of coffee and bourbon. The maple is not strong in the flavor. Very velvety and delightfully sticky, but could have been thicker. There is some vanilla but the vanilla is way stronger in KBS.
 As remarked, I could use some more maple but this is one monster of a beer and any flavor will have a hard time standing up to the strong coffee and bourbon. An excellent beer, worth the effort spent in acquiring it. That said, if I had to choose, I will take KBS.

M - hits a variety of pallette regions. Has a bitter hop balance and a swelling sweetness. My mouth is overjoyed
D - if you don't think this beer is good you are mentally retarded. 540 charactersBrewmeist, Jan 18, 2012
4.08/5  rDev -11.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Appearance: Black. Pours thick and solid. Head is coffee with too much cream. Creamy head with dense bubbles. Dwindles to a thin cap that persists throughout the drinking experience.
Smell: Burnt malts, oak, vanilla, and a touch of bourbon. Loads of old coffee fused with fresh roasted beans. Chocolate malts coupled with a deep, rich, dark chocolate. Hints, and I mean faint hints, of maple come through the back. Roasted malts like whoa.
Taste: Day old coffee and burnt malts. Chocolate in copious amounts, both malt and dark. Vanilla and oak are dominant, almost too dominant at times. Maple is only present in the aftertaste and only in marginal amounts. It hits as a lingering sweetness. A slightly more complex version of KBS (read here added depth). Slight burn from the bourbon. Caramel and toffee.
Mouthfeel: Full-bodied and just barely so. A touch dry from the booze. Clean and smooth overall.
Overall: I had the chance to try some of this on tap at EBF and it blew my mind to the point where I tried it several more times. The bottled version lacks that amazing maple quality that made the sample so damn delicious. With that said, this is still a fantastic beer, but given the insane hype and hell it created, I'll stick to KBS unless one of these falls in my lap. 1,280 charactersGoblinmunkey7, Jan 17, 2012

4.85/5  rDev +4.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured out of 750 ml bottle into CBS snifter.
A) Pours out black, and looks thick. Nice amount of head. A full finger of mocha head. The head settles to a dusting. There was ample lacing.
S) Sweet aroma of maple syrup. There is some coffee, chocolate, hops and just a hint of bourbon. Not overpowering, just very pleasing.
T) Follows the nose but is even more appealing. I was so impressed by how well the 10.6 ABV was masked. This was sweet, but that works well for the style. This has wonderful balance. There is maple syrup, coffee, dark chocolate, a bit of wood, hops and just a hint of booze. Delicious...
M) Full bodied with not much carbonation. This is so silky smooth. This one has a great finish and aftertaste.
O) This is one of the best beers I've had in recent memory. It satisfies all of the senses involved in beer consumption. As far as I'm concerned, this will be my personal gold standard for any barrel aged stouts moving forward. 954 charactersRoamingGnome, Jan 16, 2012

It's sweet but not syrupy or heavy, and the taste lingers forever. Very happy to have gotten to try a bottle of this. 392 characterskscaldef, Jan 16, 2012

A: Oil black with basically no head. On the swirl you get dark sheets and some sticky lacing. Also on swirl you get a really dark tan head.
S: Coffee, maple syrup, chocolate, sweetness. Milk chocolate. Vanilla and mild oak.
T: Mild coffee bitterness on the tip of the tongue. Then you get dark chocolate and milk chocolate goodness in the middle. Some maple sweetness and vanilla/oak. This finish is long and the flavors just keep coming at you. The ABV is so well hidden, this is a dangerous beer. Other than SOME warming in the back of the throat, you don't taste it.
M: Definitely a full bodied beer, but it's very silky smooth. Coats the mouth with sweet goodness.
O: A+ beer for me. I really could/should go all 5s across the board but I guess the appearance isn't the prettiest until you swirl. Other than that, flawless brew. Founders beers just seem like they are so well crafted compared to others. 1,062 charactersinlimbo77, Jan 14, 2012

T- the chocolate and coffe are in the front along with the maple, then the oaky vanilla from the barrel, and then a finish of more maple and bourbon.

Scent is initially maple syrup with sweet chocolate. A LOT of chocolate. Perhaps some marshmallow? Vanilla and oak with just a bit of bourbon. A little anise as well. A fantastic nose on this beer! Taste is somewhat of a letdown however. Don't get me wrong, it's a very tasty beer, just had my hopes set higher. Initially sweet chocolate and coffee. Then I get bitter chocolate with some maple syrup and light vanilla. The maple syrup is more noticeable as the beer warms. Finishes slightly bitter with some black licorice. Mouthfeel is full-bodied with a syrupy finish. This is a big beer with ABV well-hidden. Drinkability is fairly high. Overall, I'm so glad I got to try this. I was just a little let down, as it was not as good as KBS IMO. 816 charactersDovaliHops, Jan 10, 2012

A - Poured very dark brown/black. The head grows to a one finger head that quickly disapates to a consistent quarter inch head. Throughout the cunsumption the head remains consistent. 
S - Sweet beginings. Caramelization hits the olfactories with a punch. It quickly turns to a vanilla/maple extravaganza. It ends with an alcoholic tick.
T - Maple sweetness to begin, collaborated with coffee and caramel side notes. A hint of bourbon to finish with bitterness to linger. 
M - Chewy. Great full mouth feel.
O - OMG! Best beer I've had... Period. 577 charactersSteveLyman, Jan 10, 2012

Black with no light getting through. Caramel head that stays rock solid throughout. Lacing with this alcohol level is impressive. 
Nose is sweet, nutty, coffee and fantastical. 
Maple syrup adds to the sweetness. 
Burnt coffee balances the sweetness with a lingering hoppy finish.
A great beer that lives up to the hype. I wanted more and more. It's sweet, dark, roasted, hopped and everything else it can be. Top class! 453 charactersabar22, Jan 10, 2012

A: Pitch black with a dark tan head that settles with an OK lacing.
S: Maple and fig, milk chocolate, very smooth bourbon, slight hint of coffee, vanilla oak and some raspberry. Somewhat medicinal, it kind of comes together like smokey maple fire.
T: Medicinal or mentholated in the finish, almost like chocolate mints. The onset and slow build is an interesting mix of chocolate, maple, and creamy bourbon, almost like Irish cream in coffee. It is slightly sweet with a medicinal cherry finish, with little notice given to any citrus hops. It's OK.
M: Thicker, with a creamy carbonation that slowly breaks to the crisp mentholated with a sweetness that lingers on your teeth.
O: Pretty good. The aroma offsets the taste. I'd like to try this on tap--and I wouldn't mind trying it again--but I'd rather have KBS or BORIS. 853 charactersne0m00re, Jan 09, 2012

T-The syrup flavor is strongly pronounced at the first sip. Very unique taste. A great balance of sweetness and bitterness. Creamy body with a perfect coffee flavor the resinates throughout the drink.

S - Smells sweet of brown sugar. Malty smell, and scents of cocoa and a boozy whiskey aroma.
T - Wow! So smooth it is incredible. Very similar to KBS; chocolate and malty with an aged, refined finish. The difference is that instead of a slight burn you get a consistent sweetness. I love it.
M - About as good as it gets when it comes to mellowing a stout to where you really don't feel the ABV. It is thick like cough syrup, but so gentle in coating the tongue.
O - Wasn't sure I would like this more than KBS but I think I do. Glad to score a bottle of this, and the Candian version is perfect for those who like a big stout without a burn or overly roasted finish. 774 characterssocon67, Jan 08, 2012

4.97/5  rDev +7.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Thanks to ncmussell for this one.
A: 1/8" brown head that collected mainly around the edges of the glass overtop of black liquid.
S: Coffee, chocolate, maple syrup, yeast and toasted malt.
T: The first sip hit me like a cold-cock punch to the mouth. I didn't even know what happened. What gets me here is the layering of flavour on top of flavour. Coffee, dark chocolate, maple syrup, yeast and toasted malt dominate much of the taste profile along with some bourbon, cherries and molasses. I suspect a Belgian strain of yeast was used to give it some of the dark fruitiness that seems to be present.
M: Thick viscosity and a creamy mouthfeel which coats the interior of the mouth. A medium to low level of fine carbonation.
O: What can I say other than this is more like a CDS, a Canadian Dessert Stout. To be honest it almost tastes like a coffee/chocolate/maple syrup liqueur. Each mouthful almost leaves you pondering what is going on in there. 
Legendary for a reason, I believe it lives up to the hype. 1,014 charactersDaftCaskBC, Jan 07, 2012

Pours a thick, pitch black with a small tan head that lingers and laces.
Smells of a small amount of bourbon along with a big note of maple syrup, chocolate, sugar, and coffee. Interesting and pleasant aroma.
Tastes of maple and coffee up front with a sweet coffee, roast, caramel, and barrel character in the middle that finishes on a bourbon, chocolate, and coffee note. The finish lasts and lasts and morphs from maple to barrel to dark chocolate. Really complex and smooth at the same time. An onslaught of almost perfectly balanced flavors.
Heavy body with low carbonation and a alcohol presence that fits with the beer.
I haven't been this impressed with a beer in a long time. It has elements of everything in the beer but the flavor is greater than the sum of its parts as everything is balanced almost perfectly. Utterly complex and drinkable at once...the stuff beer dreams are made of. 940 charactersTenHornsProud, Jan 06, 2012

P: 750 ml bottle poured in to a snifter.
A: SRM is black. Head is khaki/chocolate, 1 in, medium bubbles, dissipates to line the top of the beer. Medium carbonation. Heavy lacing.
S: Espresso/coffee, bourbon, dark roast malt, light maple sweetness.
T: Follows nose. Big espresso/coffee notes, bourbon, dark roast malt. Maple was a little hard to discern. Alcohol is noticable. Aftertaste is same as initial pallet.
M: Full body. Viscous. Bourbon/coffee/malt/maple give a syrupy feel. Alcohol gives a bit of a medicinal feel.
O: A little surprised. For as hard as this beer was to get a hold of and as much as it was hyped, it did not meet expectations. This beer was great, but I think I would rather have a KBS. That said, the flavors were great, but the maple additions were a little hard to pick up. I am very interested to see how this beer ages. 884 characterstsauce2, Jan 06, 2012

Appearance - Dark black body (duh) with a one-finger khaki head. Decent retention and decent lacing. Nice wisps of bubbles on top of the beer.
Smell - Strong coffee aroma, as with KBS. Almost too strong, but the stout shines through enough to temper the coffee. Delicious roast and some maple sweetness in the back.
Taste - Just about perfect. Dark coffee that blends seamlessly with the stout flavors. It's difficult to discern where the coffee ends and the roasted malt begins. Another seamless transition into a maple finish. Finishes slightly sweet, with still a hint of coffee bitterness.
Mouthfeel - Perfect body. I could gulp this down if I didn't want to savor every drop of it. Low, but appropriate carbonation. The flavors linger long enough to make me want to take another sip.
Overall - I need more of this. Holy crap. I can't thank Marc enough for this bottle. Worth the hype and I'd say worth trading through the nose for in the future. 1,064 charactersAlieniloquium, Jan 04, 2012

Finally, I get a chance to taste the hallowed CBS. Next to Darkness and Westy 12, this was one of the bigger entries on my beer bucket list. So glad to be able to give it shot!
Pours thick and viscous into the glass, with tons of loose, stringy lacing arising to form the creamy head. It's actually pretty interesting as the head settles enough to split into a top layer of creamy off-white and a dark brown lower half. First time I've seen this in a beer and it is certainly a unique experience. Smell is absolutely redolent with wonderful aromas of sweet chocolate and freshly ground coffee. Slightly boozy notes of bourbon and malt are evident towards the end, providing a wholly decadent atmosphere to the smell of this brew. Definitely living up to the hype so far. 
Tons of dark chocolate and coffee from the nose mingle together in the taste to create a pleasing and complex first sip. As the beer settles on the tongue, more of the different nuances come into play, particularly a sweet caramel undertone from the maple syrup barrels. All of the aforementioned flavors combine into a taste that is unlike anything I've ever tasted before. Just phenomenal. There is a slightly alcoholic wiggle at the end that provides notes of bourbon and that double-digit ABV kick that this brew provides. So many complex flavors in CBS; it's amazing how they all meld together to create a fantastic flavor profile. Feels rich and creamy with every sip, each swallow leaving you wanting more of it, so much so that you definitely have to temper yourself while drinking this. I know I had to and it was most certainly a struggle. 
On the whole, my first experience with the legendary beer that is CBS was an amazing one. It definitely lives up to all the hype surrounding it and that is an increasingly rare feat in the world of craft today. Many, many profuse thanks to Founders Brewing for bottling this gem and allowing so many more of us enthusiasts the opportunity to sample this. 2,093 charactersr0nyn, Jan 03, 2012

Poured into a snifter. Dark, dark brown. Almost black with a fingers worth of tan head. Head becomes a bubble crown. 
Nose is pretty amazing. The sweetness of the maple syrup sticks out right away. Then a big wave of roasted coffee shows itself. As it warms I get more dark chocolate and fruits. Some woodiness rounds it out. Each whiff is slightly different and exciting.
Taste is almost equal to the nose. Sweet maple mingled with coffee, dark chocolate, some vanilla, and a little heat from the alcohol. Amazing stuff.
I like the mouthfeel. Some what thick and the syrup allws the flavor to coat the tongue.
Overall this beer lives up to everything I had heard. Count myself very lucky to score a bottle here in Colorado. 795 characterschicano4craft, Jan 02, 2012

4.92/5  rDev +6.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5CBS is pure beer magic. Poured from the bottle into a sniffer, the sweet whiskey aroma is enticing. The sweetness in the aroma is among the differences between this and other barrel aged stouts. In the glass the appearanace was a darkened color that is a brownish tint away from black with only a slight head.
The initial taste follows a warming maple and whiskey flavor with a malt backbone. It is a complex flavor that blends a measured level of sweetness and with dry notes. To some extent, the texture is slightly syrupy, but this could be an easy drinker with its smoothness. The stout has little carbonation and a thinner mouthfeel than I would have expected for a stout. Still, it is probably the best stout I have I every had.
This is a special release beer that is truly worth the anticipation. 805 charactersJohnnyHopps, Jan 02, 2012

M: Full bodied, creamy, smooth, sticky, dry and warming.
O: Very complex, sweet, smooth and easy drinking. I was a little disappointed at how light the bourbon, vanilla and oak came through compared to KBS. The sweet maple syrup on the other hand replaces it nicely. 813 charactersjustintcoons, Jan 02, 2012

O: This was well worth stalking three beer stores near me for nearly a month to get my hands on. Wonderful flavors that was remarkably smooth. I was very impressed with the little twist that the Maple gives it over the KBS. Well done Founders! 783 charactersBeRanger, Jan 02, 2012

4.32/5  rDev -6.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Thanks to ericfb18 so much for hooking me up with this long-time want. Pours an opaque black, viscous liquid, with a nice creamy small tan/ dark brown head that settles and leaves some nce spotty lacing. I like a nice head even on a big beer like this. 
Aromas begin with larger notes of espresso than I expected. Then I get the cocoa, nutty maple and roasted barley take hold of the nose. Strong bourbony alcohol scent rises as the beer warms and stimulates the olfactory senses. Simple in variety, but complex in strength. One simple descriptor would be those bourbon soaked cocoa dessert balls.
The tastes follow the nose with lots of espresso, cocoa, maple syrup sweetness and roasted maltiness. Malt sweetness amplifies with maple contributions while the bourbon flavors of toasted nuts and coconut are present throughout. Very tasty and unique because of the maple additions; really complements the bourbony alcohol bite.
The mouthfeel is creamy, rich and round while also smooth, velvety, and somewhat sweetish in weight. Bitterness arrives from a lot of angles: espresso, cocoa and alcohol. Thick but no where near syrupy. Avoiding a cloying feel, which is so important in my opinion; the beer has finishes malty and rich with lingering maple syrup flavor in aftertaste.
Overall, this is rounded and sweeter variation to the ever stable KBS, with maple sweetness that shares the stage with coffee and bourbon. Complex, yet simple and bold and yet it greatly succeeds. However, I am torn on this beer. I really love the flavor profile but it lacks the depth and complexity I was hoping for. Is it really good, heck yes, is it mindblowingly delicious and complex to make it one of the top beers on the planet, I have my doubts there. Definitely recommended and worth a go, but don't go too overboard to acquire. 1,821 charactersclaspada, Jan 02, 2012

*beer review number 100 is determined per my Beer Advocate running total. This is "only" posted review number 98 for SaBEERmetrics. There are two reviews that I have not posted here yet for beers that I reviewed before starting this blog.
Reviewing the infamous Canadian Breakfast Stout (CBS) from Founders Brewing Company.
Score: 97
2011 vintage bottle served in an oversized brandy snifter glass.
Appearance: Jet black color, 100% opaque. No light cuts through this stuff. Pours two fingers of creamy tan/cocoa colored head that very slowly settles into a half finger. Amazing, sticky lacing. 5/5
Smell: Coffee and creamy chocolate. Some fig and maple with muted marshmallows/vanilla. Roasted chocolate aromas come out as the beer warms, and caramelized/burnt brown sugar smells become apparent as the amount of beer in the glass dwindles. 4.5/5
Taste: Very balanced and delicious. Smooth maple and mellow bourbon up front. Lots of creamy chocolate thereafter. Lots of smooth syrupy flavors without the syrupy stickiness/thickness. Lingering maple/chocolate flavor. Increasing amounts chocolate and raisins as it layers. Definitely getting dark fruit on the mid-palate. 10.6% ABV is completely hidden. The flavors are not super intense, but they are amazing. 4.75/5
Mouthfeel: Full-medium bodied with the perfect minimal level of carbonation. Viscous and velvety, like melted chocolate (only lighter on the palate). The flavor of this beer absolutely coats the palate. Finish is sweet. 5/5
Overall: While I would not call CBS my favorite beer, it is an absolutely fantastic, must-try brew. Truly "world class." There is a reason that this brew is universally recognized as one of the best beers in the world. I am very tempted to keep my second bottle for a future tasting, but the Rare variant of Goose Island Bourbon County Brand Stout beckons...
Recommendation: A must-try stout for beer geeks and casual beer drinkers alike. Highly recommend people try this one.
Pairings: This one is a dessert in and of itself, and should be enjoyed as such. Maybe you could pair it with waffles.
Cost: $7.99 for a 22 oz (bomber) bottle. 2,275 charactersjegross2, Jan 01, 2012
4.35/5  rDev -6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours deep black and with a tan finger head that leaves some lacing. Aromas of coffee and then some maple, vanilla, spice and malt in the backround. Tastes much of the same but more intense than the smell. The maple shows up at the back end of the sip and then the taste of coffee lingers. Palate is as smooth as the other Founders Stouts which is great! Overall it's a great beer that may be a bit hurt by all the hype it's been given. 436 charactersthepeter, Jan 01, 2012
5/5  rDev +8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Thanks to my best friend for this generous Christmas surprise.
Appearance: black gold. Opaque, and creamy looking. Thick tan head and lacing.
Smell: man oh man. Maple is not as forward as the fresh bottle I split when this was released. Reminds of kbs, but maybe even better. Reminds also of a fine chilled mocha. Dark chocolate, espresso. Maple still part of the mix, and a wonderful mix it is.
Taste: all that is in the nose in a perfectly balanced taste. Mellow and vibrant at the sAme time.
Mouthfeel: fat creamy goodness.
Overall: I have a hard time giving perfect scores what with much more experienced ba's never going that far. But when a beer transcends what I thought a great beer was, I gotta do it. Like kbs this one deserves the hype.
Update 07/29/2012 : lucky enough to have 2 more bottles saved. Much debate that this should not be aged. One legitimate point is that the maple will fade. Yes, but it's still in the profile, and man is this freak smooth. Drinkin like a milkshake. Awesome. 1,004 characterscindyjeffsmith, Jan 01, 2012

this beer pours a dark brown to almost black color with a fairly small mocha colored head. the smell is slightly oaky with a very small hint of maple and bourbon. there was really a lot less bourbon and maple than i was expecting. the flavor is very smooth lightly roasty a little sweet with hints of maple booubon and oak. the mouthfeel is smooth and lightly carbed. overall this is a good beer, i just don't think it quite lives up to the hype that was surrounding it. My friends and I enjoyed it, and I was glad to have a chance to try it. 656 charactersrowingbrewer, Jan 01, 2012

Huge smell. Loads of coffee and chocolate up front. Warm boozy alcohol scent towards the end.
Wow, wow, wow. Beyond words really. Chocolate, coffee, maple syrup, vanilla bean, bourbon. They're all here and make one of the most beautiful tasting beverages I've ever experienced. Huge taste, with some semi-hot alcohol. Just so damn good.
Very smooth and sticky, but finishes dry. The body is not quite full and feels thin for the style, but it still works just fine. Carbonation seems fine.
Easily in my top five of best beers I've ever tasted. Just an outstanding beer that lives up to every once of hype. 717 charactersjera1350, Jan 01, 2012
4.1/5  rDev -11.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.5Big boy bottle enjoyed over a few hours of crapulence while the year winds down into oblivion.
Into my Darkness snifter: very dark, big mocha puff, steady and sticky lacing.
Nose is marshmallow, caramel, bourbon, vanilla, spot of hots, and maple. 
Taste is smooth and rich maple, medium roasted coffee, meld of chocolate, marshmallow, and a long fade of massive sweetness and alcohol. Bitterness lingers long after the finish.
Mouthfeel is pillow soft with spot on carbonation and persistent heat.
Overall, this is just too sweet and becomes cloying deeper into the bottle. My first experience with this beer was bitter disappointment: from a plastic cup out of questionable tap lines. My second was after running a marathon and turd soup may have hit the spot. I enjoyed it much more then. Tonight, this is a very solid stout but I'm not sure it's near as good as KBS if you're even making comparisons from the same brewery. Not quite the world class stout that many pimp it as, but worth the opportunity to try. 1,018 charactersBarrytheBear, Jan 01, 2012

Dark as night pour with a fluffy caramel head, 1 finger that dissipates rather quickly. 
Sweet milk chocolate smell blended perfectly with espresso notes. The maple and bourbon ties it all together perfectly. 
So incredibly smooth tasting. Roasted caramel and coffee notes. Slight sweetness from the maple, but it's not overpowering. It blends so well with the bourbon. The alcohol is so well-hidden with just a slight warming sensation on the back end. Everything a world-class stout should taste like. Wow.
Luxurious mouthfeel. Thick, luscious velvet-like texture. I could almost eat this with a spoon.
Epic beer! This is truly a masterpiece - a real luxury. The perfect stout in my estimation. This is the gold standard by which all imperial stouts should be judged. 829 characterskdmcguire10, Jan 01, 2012

Pours midnight black with an inviting fluffy tan head. Looks perfect. 
Nose is incredible. Decidedly, but not overwhelmingly, sweet. The chocolate and maple/bourbon come together like a lovely Ménage à trois. The coffee plays a supporting role, lending just enough roasted notes to smooth it all out. 
Taste is everything I want in a stout. All the flavors work together in balance - sweetness with a touch of alcohol heat up front, and a light but noticeable bitter bite on the finish. 
Mouth is full, but not viscous. It actually comes across as a bit fluffy to me, almost mousse-like. 
Founders has a true gem with CBS. I really hope that their current expansion can help them get more of this beer into distribution at a reasonable price. Fantastic brew, as close to a perfect stout as I've had. 879 charactersmondegreen, Dec 31, 2011

4.83/5  rDev +4.3%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Nice small light mocha head from an aggressive pour. Very dark body, hues of brown in the light. Also brown comes through where the beer touches the sides of the glass. Lots of nice sticky lacing. 
Rich, robust, and very sugary sweet coffee aroma. Coffee grinds, cocoa powder, dark semi-sweet chocolate. A bit of oak and molasses.
Molasses, bitter sweet chocolate, burnt roasted malts, and coffee/espresso taste. Faint bourbon flavor sits on the back of the tounge. Sweet syrupy goodness coats the palate. Smooth and silky mouthfeel, not getting any heat from the alcohol. Carbonation is just right here. The sweetness is strong but never becomes cloying. Sweetness is very light in the finish and a bit of dryness at the end...which I wasn't expecting.
Founders once again proves that they know how to make an absolutely fantastic stout! Add this to the list I've had from them which are great stouts...KBS, FBS, Imperial Stout, and now CBS. I do like KBS more than this one, but CBS certainly delivers. A big stout that is able to mask its alcohol very well...maybe at the expense of some sweetness, but the fact that it is so well balanced is quite impressive.

A - This is a pitch brown oil. With a brown/beige head that stays strongly alive, there is hardly a retraction.
S - Chocolate bourbon, mixed with oak wood my absolute favorite.
T - A sweet chocolate, vanilla, caramel liquid, mixed with bourbon and oak wood. Besides the taste there was a sweet- and bitterness to be discovered. What a perfect blend, so smooth.
M - A soft carbonation that is a joy for my mouth, it leaves a nice chocolate bourbon coating. The balance in this beer is absolutely amazing. It even feels subtle.

M - Full bodied. Extremely smooth. A little syrupy too. For a beer this strong in abv, there is no heat whatsoever.
O - CBS lives up to the hype. It may very well be the best beer I've ever had. I didn't think FBS could be improved upon, but the maple and bourbon do it. If you can find this, get it. It would get a 6/5 in my book. 648 charactersWMEugene, Dec 30, 2011

Celebrating the holidays with jtip, providence & sal.
Once in a lifetime I'm sure...
Poured into a Founders snifter black with a finger of foamy tan head that holds well. Nose is sweet, syrup, chocolate notes, coffee beans medium roast, bourbon notes and wood (oak, bit smokey).
Taste is creamy smooth, chocolate and coffee dominant with bourbon aftertaste. Cream like you'd put in your coffee, slight vanilla perhaps, molasses. Some more wood notes come through. Syrup is evident but not overpowering, nicely done. 
Mouthfeel is medium to heavy, again very smooth.
Overall, an excellent beer made from the highest quality ingredients by the best micro brewery in America. Very happy to get to sample this highly coveted brew. Cheers to Founders for their craft! 789 charactersheebes, Dec 27, 2011

5/5  rDev +8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Let me give it to you bluntly. Every aspect of this beer is simply amazing. 
I poured this in an oversized wine glass. It leaves the bottle looking like motor oil 10,000 miles past it's prime. The head on this is a wonderful medium brown with great lacing. This beer really pours heavy.
The nose on this has strong hints of coffee and maple syrup as well as a hint of toasted oak. Upon tasting I was completely blown away. The front end contains some essence of a basic Founder Breakfast Stout but with extreme concentrations of coffee bean and dark chocolate, met with with a mellow blend of maple syrup and bourbon towards the middle. This beer ends with more maple syrup and vanilla, followed by a mild but great hop bite. Divine!!
This beer feels smooth and creamy, the carbonation is there but light, there is no alcohol burn present whatsoever.
All in all, I think this beer should be in the running for #1. Founders never dissapoint's and after trying this brew they are now tops on my list. 1,002 charactersMerryTapster, Dec 26, 2011

A. Chugs out of the bottle into 2 fingers of super thick and dense dark tan colored head. Excellent retention. Super thick lacing. Color is all black. 
S. Smelling the cap on this give a pretty clear aroma pictures. Bourbon, maple, vanilla, coffee. Actually smelling this beer lends loads of aroma. Coffee, molasses, maple, vanilla, a real nice roastiness, dark chocolate, some milk chocolate. Bourbon comes out a little more as it warms along with oak and vanilla. Really amazing array or aromas. 
T. Vanilla, coffee, bourbon, maple, molasses. 2nd drink goes maple, vanilla, coffee. Extemely smooth and well balanced. Incredible depth of flavor but drinks entirely too easy. That is what I consider a masterfully crafted beer. One that doesnt need to taste like straight bourbon to impart all of the flavor nuances of a bourbon barrel. I will be honest and admit that there isnt a lot of maple flavor in this beer, it is definitely a subtle part of the beer. The only flaw for me, and this is just personal preference is the amount of coffee flavor in this just like KBS and FBS. Not a huge fan, but this is the best of all 3 of those. 
M. Super creamy mouthfeel. Everything a stout should be. Smooth, rich and creamy. Medium carbonation. Finishes with a hint of vanilla and oak. Lovely
O. Ok. Is this the best stout in the world? If its not it is definitely in the heavyweight title fight. This takes everything that KBS is which is already a phenomenal beer and makes it a touch better. Maple, vanilla, coffee, molasses, and chocolate.... I mean come on how does it get better than that. So this year has been a big one for me in terms of the big daddy stouts. Had Vanilla BCBS to celebrate Moriah's birth. The Abyss for my birthday. And CBS on Xmas. Here is hoping 2012 is just as good. 1,884 characterssiradmiralnelson, Dec 26, 2011

5/5  rDev +8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I lucked out and snagged a bottle from a local shop before they jacked the price up to internet price. I had previously had some pours of this at the Three Floyds Anniversary party thanks to a few very kind beer geeks in line. I savored these tastes like no other. Yes hype is annoying and getting worse I feel within the awesome loving beer community, but fuck if this didn't live up to it. This is my all time favorite stout if not beer. Judge me as a hype whore or not it's so freaking delicious it pains me that I can't have it all the time. Although I think the hunt, find, and pour for friends actually adds to the fun and love of this beer. It's an event when you get a bottle. I will always drink it fresh after having tasted a year old and a fresh. I love the coffee notes and those become less noticeable with age. It's almost relieving knowing I enjoy something so great fresh, so when I do get a bottle I don't have to put in the cellar for a year or more to enjoy it. If anyone wants to send me a bottle ever please mail me.
It looks like heaven.
It smells like heaven.
It tastes like heaven.

Pour: Dark black, like motor oil with a thick and creamy and well retaining dark tanned espresso like head.
Nose: Maple syrup (duh), coffee grounds, vanilla, oak, subtle bourbon notes of rich toffee, toasted coconut, and smooth molasses.
Taste: Big maple syrup all the way through the taste, coffee grounds or espresso, then the subtle and extremely well integrated bourbon hits with a small heat and vanilla, oak, toasted coconut and rich chocolate. The aftertaste is more maple and some drying oak.
Mouthfeel: Rich and creamy just simply decadent here, very velvety smooth.
Overall: This beer is perfect. The richness is great and the bourbon so well integrated. I love KBS but this is a step up. Really truly great. Very sweet but I love it. Fantastic :) Thanks Adam (splax23). 813 characterswaltersrj, Dec 24, 2011
4.25/5  rDev -8.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4.5from notes.
Black body, with a decent tan head.
The nose is of coffee upfront, with some maple notes. While quite enjoyable, I was expecting the maple to be the main focus.
The taste is mostly of coffee, maple and cocoa.
The mouthfeel is medium bodied, and slightly oily and mouth-coating with fairly low carbonation, though it is appropriate for the beer.
A very well done stout in the big picture of stouts, though for one of very few in which maple syrup is incorporated in some way I was expecting a bit more of an emphasis on the maple. 546 charactersvkv822, Dec 24, 2011

very rich and full. a great combo of maple syrup, dark candied fruit, roasted malt, subtle bourbon, and black licorice.
similar to the nose however with an added coffee and chocolate bitterness. some citrus hops in the back end. same combo mentioned above. very complex and robust. not much alcohol really, only a hint here and there.
mild carbonation but thick and full. very slick and oily with a bit of a dry finish.
this was delicious up and down, easy to drink, never got boring. only flaw was a bit too sweet. 708 charactershooliganlife, Dec 23, 2011

A: Dark, as expected. 1 finger dark cocoa colored head which slowly fades
S: At first, I mostly get dark chocolate and coffee, was expecting maple which does show up when the beer warms, but not much. Bourbon throughout
T: Bitter coffee, cocoa and a maple finish. Very good, but honestly I was expecting more. 
M: Super creamy with a bitter aftertaste
O: I love KBS and maple so I thought this would be the best of both worlds. It's a damn good beer, but I think I prefer KBS and I'm not a big coffee guy. 543 charactersbuffs9, Dec 22, 2011

4.3/5  rDev -7.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5This beer was sampled after the 2007 through 2011 vertical Abyss and BA Hunahpu tasting at the finewinemike event, and I have to wonder if the CBS suffered by comparison. Especially after the BA Hunahpu, this beer really did not seem to show all that well (at least not as well as I was expecting).
The beer pours a blackish brown color with good head retention and lacing. On the nose, I get a considerable aroma of coffee grounds and light maple syrup, with some underlying citrus (surprisingly, I thought) and vainilla as well. While attractive, my recollection is that I thought this beer considerably more impressive on tap. On the palate, this beer is much better, as I picked up some chocolate, a hint of mint and light tobacco, in addition to the coffee ground flavor and vanilla. While the beer is at least moderately sweet, there's some bitterness on the finish that helps to counter that sweetness. Mouthfeel was medium bodied, and frankly, I thought the bottled version came across as just a bit thin on the palate. The beer finishes well, with some noticeable coffee, dark chocolate and light licorice. 
The bottled version seemed a bit more complex to me than the draft version did, and I'm wondering if this beer wouldn't benefit from a bit of short term aging. This is a fine beer, no doubt, but it really didn't show as well as I was expecting during the tasting at finewinemike's. 1,400 charactersJohn_M, Dec 21, 2011

A: Pours a very dark brown, black in the glass, with a big brown head that fades to a ring and leaves a lot of lacing on the glass. I was a bit surprised by the head on this one given the ABV.
S: The nose is incredibly rich and amazing. Huge notes of coffee, chocolate, bourbon, molasses, and vanilla drift out of the glass with a nice touch of sweet maple in the background.
T: The taste mirrors the nose but with a bit more of the maple. Beautiful flavors of coffee, vanilla, bourbon, chocolate, maple, and molasses are detected with each sip. 
M: The feel is about perfect for a stout like this. Big, thick, and creamy with a sticky finish.
O: This is what I expected KBS to taste like when I first had it. It's amazing how different barrels can make a beer 10x better than it's counter part. The coffee, maple, and barrel notes really play well together and make a great beer. I didn't want to believe the hype but now I'm glad I traded for this one. Definitey in my top 5 beers of all time if not my top 3. Thanks to Brian for the trade and opportunity to try this long time want! 1,124 charactersGregSVT, Dec 19, 2011

Pours deep black with a rich dark brown head. Ample lacing lined the glass.
Sweet malt, bourbon, and coffee all intermingle on the nose. In the background there is maple, vanilla, and chocolate. The sweetness struck me at first, but as it warmed up, the bourbon got much stronger. 
The taste is also very sweet, but there is a lot of bourbon notes as well. It is very complex, and incredibly balanced between sweet burnt sugar, chocolate, maple, vanilla, and bourbon.
Medium bodied, and rich carbonation.
Overall, this is the best stout I have had. If you haven't had this yet, you really should. HIGHLY recommended. 725 charactersfatmcb1, Dec 18, 2011

Pours midnight black with a 1/4 inch of off white, creamy head into my cognac snifter. Smells of vanilla infused coffee, bourbon, maple syrup and chocolate. The taste is a bit mutes and more mellow than expected. A sweet concoction of maple-bourbon, chocolate milk with a very light bourbon undertone. The alcohol is barely noticeable, which makes this a very easy beer to drink - almost too easy. Light carbonation with a medium body adds to this effect. 
Overall a really good beer - a bit more coffee on the nose than I'd like and wish that the flavor was a bit more pronounced - everything is very well integrated and smooth. Minor issues as this is one of the great stouts out there. 736 charactersJoeySchlitz, Dec 16, 2011

A- pours black, small tan head, leaving a stain on the glass
S- coffee upfront, very sweet aroma, some bourbon as well which I wasn't expecting
T- lots of coffee, very sweet, much more of a bite than KBS and FBS, not much much maple syrup but you do get the tartness like you would after eating pancakes...again a bourbon flavor to it, aftertaste is chocolate
M- thick, sticky, like a stout should be
O- this is a great stout and if you're lucky enough to find it in on the shelf you should buy it for several reasons. However, overall I have to say I feel it has been over-hyped. To me, this tastes like an aged FBS with a higher ABV. It had much more coffee flavor and much more bite than I was expecting. Maybe a beer rated this high can't live up to the expectations, but I wasn't blown away and I expected to be. KBS is better. 912 charactersmgp2675, Dec 15, 2011

This pours thick and smooth. Pitch black with a minimal brown head that dissolves to a halo quickly. The scent has a touch of booze, but is very much malty sweetness, I get lots of chocolate off it, perhaps the maple faded some? Smooth chocolatey flavor, a bit of roasty malt finish, but predominately sweet. The mouth feel is velvety goodness, I'd love to try this again, and hope they'll release it again next year.

Pours a very dark brown close to black with a small darkish tan head that has good retention and leaves some light lacing on the glass. The is big coffee, some dark chocolate, some vanilla and a bit of bourbon, oak, and some light alcohol. Quite awesome. The initial taste is sweet with dark chocolate, then comes a lot of coffee. A decent amount of oak as well as a bit of vanilla and some bourbon. The maple is there as well, but not overpowering. The finish has a decent coffee bitterness. Medium body. Medium carbonation. Great beer. A substantial improvement over KBS. The coffee is quite strong, and the maple sweetness is not overpowering, which I was slightly worried about. 741 charactersjethrodium, Dec 13, 2011

Review adapted from notes taken 12-11-11
Appearance: Jet black, bubbly tan head, sticky, spotty lacing
Smell: Intense, intriguing - wood, bourbon, vanilla, char, burnt malts - a lot of chocolate and coffee - some dry maple syrup in the background, but honestly not as much as I was expecting - a little hint of booze, too
Taste: So many flavors - a blast of wood, bourbon at first - underneath the bourbon barrel assault, there are some burnt, charred, malts - some lighter, chewier malts, too - burnt bitterness, some sweetness - the maple syrup flavor combines with the malt sweetness at the back of the tongue, creates a phenomenal aftertaste
Mouthfeel: Medium to heavy body, smooth, creamy, nicely carbonated
Overall: Yeah, it's good, but it's not earth-shattering
I had this at an EBF a few years ago, and it blew my mind into pieces. Perhaps my tastes have changed, but I think there is a lot less maple and a lot more wood in this bottled iteration. It could use some more balance. Honestly, it's a little better than KBS, but if I had to pick... I would pick Founders Breakfast Stout. And I wouldn't have to kill anyone to get it! 1,186 charactersangrybabboon, Dec 13, 2011
4.12/5  rDev -11%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Presentation: Cool label, 750 Belgian-style brown bottle. The wife just finished her classes and got exemplary marks for the semester, and I just finished a term paper. Bring on this bad boy!
Appearance: Split with the wife into snifters, this beer pours out a dark brown, but is obsidian black in the glass wit a thick, rich cap the color of wet sand, which shows pretty nice retention. 
Smell: Tons of vivid, sweet, pungent-but-not-sharp-or-burnt coffee up front, supported by a ghost of maple sugar sweetness. Would I have been able to pick this out without knowing this was aged in maple-bourbon barrels? Probably not, but maybe. Either way, this is one amazing-smelling imperial coffee stout. Ghost of dark chocolate, and no real hint of an alcohol burn here.
Taste: The bourbon is appreciated in the flavor, though it wasn't on the nose. In fact, it's fairly prevalent, though not quite harsh. There's some bourbon and dry, tannic oak, along with hints of bitter chocolate as well. Definitely a nice, sugary sweetness in the background. It's different from a chocolate or malt sweetness, and it's pleasant. Again, would I peg this as maple if I didn't know the ingredients? Probably not. There is a coffee presence, but not nearly as strong of one as is suggested by the aromas and it comes across mostly on the finish. At 10.6%, this brew falls somewhere between warming and a bit hot, but it's certainly not sharp. The sugary sweetness (again, I'm thinking from the maple) is pleasant, multi-dimensional, and balances well with the alcohol and other flavors. That being the case, I wouldn't want an entire 750 of this to myself, as I think it might get a bit cloying. 
Mouthfeel: Full, smooth, silky, ghost of bite
Overall: The final verdict? I was incredibly excited (and fortunate) to get to try two highly-sought after stouts this year: Darklord 2011 (thanks Alewatcher!) and CBS. After hawking three stores in town, I got 3 bottles: one for my wife and I, and one each for my father and father-in-law for Christmas. The grand total? About $50. And a whole lot of time. So, the question is, was it worth it? While I was horribly disappointed by Dark Lord (hey, that just means I don't have to drive to IN this spring or...well...ever) this is honestly quite good. Nice sweetness, fairly restrained booze, wonderful aromas, and interesting profile overall. Was it enjoyable? Abso-floggin-lutely. Is it an A+ beer in my mind? No. The flavors, while awesome, don't show the incredible depth/definition of the very best. Would we buy it again for $16.00? Well, that depends. If it was a fairly readily-available yearly release, we'd probably pick up a bottle every year or so. Would I go to the ends of the earth for one or trade my cellar away for it? Probably not. None of this ought to take away from this beer. Founders did a great job, but when a beer is hyped as much as this one is, it's almost impossible to live up to the hype. 2,948 charactersBedetheVenerable, Dec 13, 2011

4.6/5  rDev -0.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a standard stout black with a 2 finger head, nothing special... was hoping for that redish brown head like Hunahpu's/Double Black/etc has...no biggie.
Aroma; some roastiness, a bit of coffee, some maple syrup.
Taste; wow, incredible balance notes of dark chocolate, coffee, maple, and a nice woodiness in the finish.
Finishes with a bit of alcohol astringency, coffee, dark chocolate, and a lingering hint of bourbon.
Overall; imo, there are two ways that stellar imperial stouts can go. Layered and complex, or solid & well balanced. This is one of those solid well balanced ones and I loved it! 604 characterspixieskid, Dec 12, 2011

4.95/5  rDev +6.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 522 oz. bomber poured into a Duvel Tulip style glass. The liquid portion of this beer comes out completely black. No highlights can be seen anywhere, black all the way to the edges. Darker than tan frothy head that erupts to the top after a reasonably hard pour, the size of the bubbles vary all over the cap. The head produces some decent lacing, but the liquid coats the glass like a thin syrup so everything makes it's way back down to the liquid pool VERY slowly. 
As expected, this beer smells awesome. It has similar qualities to the original Founders Breakfast Stout by smelling of dark, bittersweet chocolate, and coffee/espresso. The big difference is the sweetness. Bourbon and maple syrup clearly present right in the beginning and it smells wonderful. Though all that there is still an earthy hop presence. 
Again as expected, the taste is wonderful as well, completely on par with the taste. Complex combination of dark roasted malts producing flavors of dark bitter chocolate and dark roasted coffee flavors. I'm not the biggest hard liquor fan, but the bourbon flavors complement this beer pretty well especially combined with the maple flavor, it's really good. Slight dry earthy hop finish. A lot going on here and it's all REALLY good.
Mouthfeel is also really good. For how dark and thick this brew is, I would almost expect you'd have to chew it. It doesn't have to be chewed, but it just wasn't what I was expecting. The original breakfast stout did the same thing too me. Full bodied, well balanced and perfectly drinkable. I guess it could be a little thicker, but I really would find this to be a very difficult beer to improve. Alcohol is present, but doesn't have any negative effects. This is just an all around wonderful brew. This was probably the #1 hyped beer of 2011 and to me it completely lived up to it. Nice job Founders, as usual!
This beer was consumed while watching the Patriots beat the Redskins. Grandpa, I think you would have enjoyed both today...Rest In Peace, we'll miss you 2,023 charactersAndyAvalanche, Dec 11, 2011

4.03/5  rDev -13%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4750ml bottle courtesy of Eric and Trav. Viscous black liquid with a beautiful dark foam. The aroma is a bit underwhelming for what I expected. It's not maple-like, but definitely a bit chocolatey with some vanilla bourbon notes. 
The taste is very sweet, but the maple flavor is not apparent here either. You would assume it's very chocolatey tasting, but thinking about it carefully it's more of a vanilla character. There is a hint of charred smoke also. The end has a faint splash of bourbon that is well incorporated into the flavor and isn't overdone. The problem I have is a lack of bitterness at the back. The finish is actually a bit cloying, perhaps it's just too much sweetness from the alcohol, but it makes for a slow sipper. The mouthfeel is a bit on the chewy side, thicker than I would expect for a stonger, bourbon-aged beer, but overall it works. The carbonation is nicely done. 
In the end this beer just didn't live up to the hype. I would have expected to be savoring every last drop, but it wasn't that amazing. It's a nice stout overall, but the lingering sweetness was a bit too much. I can see why alot of folks would rate it higher, but for me it needs more complexity and balance to make it top notch. 1,229 charactersbennetj17, Dec 10, 2011

Appearance: the Canadian Breakfast Stout pours pitch black with a khaki colored head.
Smell: there's a predominate aroma of strong, blended coffees. Traces of bourbon in the nose as well.
Taste: oh wow, where to start?! There's a mouthful of roasted coffee beans, dark chocolates, sweet maple syrup, roasted malt, bourbon, vanilla, and oak.
Mouthfeel: lush and full bodied.. very smooth.
Overall: Founders CBS is arguably the most complex imperial stout I've ever had.. and certainly worth the hype. I can't wait for the third release in the backstage series. 748 charactersBlastBeats, Dec 10, 2011

A- Nice two finger brown head that dissipates slowly, nice lacing and retention, pitch black color, opaque.
S- Slight bourbon, really sweet, some vanilla, brown sugar, the maple comes out strong, slight coffee, chocolate.
T- Really smooth, really rich as well, the maple really comes out strong, the bourbon is hard to find, sweet, some chocolate and dark malts, slight coffee presence, this beer is so rich its a sipper, the alcohol is hidden well.
M- Medium mouth feel, really smooth drinking, silky smooth, clean finish, coats the palate.
O- Was a little let down by this bottle, I had it a couple months ago for the first time and remember it being better and more roasty. This bottle was really rich and sweet, the maple syrup notes took over. Still an excellent beer, prefer KBS in the long run. 873 charactersChriscrundwell12, Dec 10, 2011

appearance: short pour in an unbranded snifter during "big wood" - dark mahogany body, little head - mild carbonation
smell: fresh roasted coffee, maple, roasted malt, vanilla, bourbon, rich caramel
taste: i've had this before but only a handful of times and never in a really personal setting - damn tasty, but i still think i'm content with 4 KBS bottles for the same price. Founders definitely crafted this well - extremely well balanced - maple, coffee, chocolate, vanilla and bourbon. i told myself i would pass on this, but then i got to brouwers and couldnt resist. Damn you hypetrain.
mouthfeel: great, perfect really. balanced, full bodied, rich and creamy
overall: sigh, lovely 721 charactersdirtylou, Dec 10, 2011

Aroma was sweet like a bakery with numerous flavors rising out of the glass. Notable coffee aromas with a strong dose of vanilla and molasses on top. Just a hint of roast in the background. 
Maple and brown sugar bring out quite a lot of sweetness on the palate. A bit of an oaky vanilla character. Underlying coffee notes and just a big of roasted malt from the base stout. 
Mouthfeel is incredibly smooth and creamy. Overall, CBS absolutely delivers all that it was promised to be. Maple character makes for a nice twist on a great stout. 654 charactersKinsman, Dec 08, 2011

I smell a good coffee flavor, boozy smell that I would contribute to the bourbon barrel, and very disappointingly a very faint maple. The coffee flavor is good not great, and the bourbon flavor is good but the maple flavor is very muted almost like the coffee over powers the maple flavor. The mouth feel is good its slick and slightly oily. I had this beer a year ago at the brewery and it was the most fantastic beer I ever had, this isnt that beer. I don't know if they changed the recipe or something but I was very let down by this in a bottle. Dont get me wrong this is a solid beer but I can think of several other stouts that I would much rather have. 841 charactersphisigben, Dec 06, 2011
4.65/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.522 oz bottle, allowed to warm some before being cracked for review #400 and poured into my Duvel tulip.
Canadian Breakfast Stout pours pitch black. The foam, which is past caramel and halfway to milk chocolate in color, billows up to about four fingers in height. The lacing left around the glass is gorgeous, sheetlike for the most part. Head retention is very good, but just a bit short of perfection. Coffee is the first thing that that jumps out about the nose (which is heavenly), although rich milk chocolate and maple aromas are also present. Everything is so well integrated that it takes a while to pull apart all the different components. The flavor, and I wasn't sure it was possible, is even better. Creamy milk chocolate and a splash of maple syrup swirl together at the front end of each sip. A mild bourbon note that gives a slight warming sensation fills the mid palate, before a strong coffee flavor comes in to close things out. The carbonation is spot on, nice and low. Meanwhile, the body, while being both silky and creamy, could stand to be a bit more full/sturdy. Any qualms I have with Canadian Breakfast Stout are minor, as this is truly one of the top few stouts being brewed in this country. I got up at an obscenely early hour to hunt down bottles of this, and I'd do it all again without hesitation. 1,329 charactersaxeman9182, Dec 06, 2011

Huge fresh roasted coffee beans and well complementing vanilla and chocolate notes. Flavor begins with the huge, tasty coffee notes. So fresh and pure. Awesome touches of vanilla and chocolate give it a silky smooth middle before the finish that is off the charts. Great maple syrup flavor blends with the flavors and gives this one the best finish in a beer I have ever tried. The flavors are perfectly crafted, nothing gimmicky, just pure great flavors throughout.

4.97/5  rDev +7.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5poured into a Duvel tulip. i planned on cellaring this one for a while, but after much careful consideration i decided "what's the point in aging an already barrel aged beer?". i never really thought of a good reason, so let's review this puppy.
a: i have been anxiously awaiting the opportunity to try this beer for years. i still can't believe this is sitting in my glass right now. pitch black in color with a fluffy cocoa powder colored head. looks amazing, but i wish there was a tad bit more head retention and the lacing is fairly thin by Breakfast Stout standards. 
s: so many notes, i cant believe what i'm smelling. roasted malt, coffee, chocolate, vanilla and maybe a hint of bourbon. incredible. i hope it tastes like this.
t: oh man. i'm so glad this was worth the wait. i was worried the hype was getting to me. intense coffee flavor with roasted malt flavors. warming alcohol and bourbon character is there, then suddenly the chocolate and maple syrup flavor hits. i can't compliment this beer enough. the barrels truly kept everything together and made this beer the BEST imperial stout i have ever had.
m: velvety smooth mouthfeel.
i knew i would enjoy this beer, but i did not think it would be to this degree. if you like imperial stouts this is one that cannot be missed. 1,296 characterstzieser, Dec 06, 2011

4.5/5  rDev -2.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A - Pours black with a good three fingers of tan head. Head has excellent retention and leaves spots of lacing.
S - Aromas of coffee and chocolate initially, yielding to sweet maple syrup, vanilla and oak. Just a touch of alcohol in the aroma.
T - Sweet maple syrup and chocolate, followed by coffee and then a nice bourbon presence. The sweetness builds, but just when I think it is going to be too much, the sweet elements fade and a dry oak barrel presence carries through to the finish. I've had a few batches of this, and I think the sweetness in the bottled version is somewhere in the middle of the batches I've tried: definitely substantial, but not overwhelming. Definitely a good maple syrup presence, but this finishes very dry and clean. Excellent.
M - Full mouthfeel. Initially a bit syrupy sweet, but turns halfway through into a rather dry tannin-filled finish.
O - Just an excellent and unique stout. A touch on the sweet side to want too often, but this is a nice treat and another great stout from Founders. 1,029 characterswarnerry, Dec 05, 2011

A - motor oil. pours like syrup into a tulip glass, with no head. very special.
S - vanilla, hershey syrup - i need a side of ice cream.
T - well, this beer holds up to the hype. Ripe vanilla notes that are delicious, not overstated (a la creme brulee stout), with warming bourbon tones. the 10.6% adds the perfect amount of heat. This beer is lush and sticky sweet. The best part is that the finish will last for minutes. This is mouth coating and one sip will carry you for a long time. 
M - chocolate velvet - silky smooth feel with just enough carbonation to remind you that it's a beer.
O - i tried as hard as i could to make this last! so good, you'll find yourself drinking it too quickly. Not sure if it's worth the grey-market price of $100 - but for $50 or under it's certainly worth it. Special stout that is a full-fledged dessert. To this day, I have not had a beer that has as pronounced a finish as this one. You will taste the beer long after you swallow. If you do get your hands on a bottle, do yourself a favor and only share with one other person. 1,093 charactersseasonsix, Dec 03, 2011

4.08/5  rDev -11.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Another review input from notes. Notes came from both bottle and growler.
Poured into oversized snifter. Deep black body, opaque and viscous. Two and a half finger mocha colored head is set atop. The head sticks around, retention is impressive. Decent lacing left clinging to the glass as the head recedes.
The aroma leans towards the sweet side. Chocolate, molasses and a bit of a sweet earthy maple. There is a fair amount of coffee upset that helps balance out the sweeter scents. The bourbon emerges from beneath. Well integrated, bourbon comes through with caramel and vanilla flavors with only a soft booziness.
The flavor matches the aroma nearly stride for stride. Sweet flavors flood the palate up front, the maple being a bit more dominant that in the nose. Brown sugar and caramel flavors show up just behind. A dark chocolate and java flavor hold their own against the flavors up front. Vanilla and bourbon flavors integrated through out. The pour from the growler seemed a bit hotter than the bottle, but still showing an appropriate amount of restraint.
Full bodied Imperial Stout, carbonation comes in at a low to moderate level. The texture is rich and creamy and the finish long.
CBS is a very good beer, deserving of many of the accolades it has received. This is a big beer but manages to remain rather drinkable. The heat and booziness never become too abrasive. With everything that is right about this beer, it is a bit too sweet for my liking. Despite my personal opinion this is a beer you should try if you are ever presented the opportunity. 1,572 characterskzoobrew, Dec 03, 2011

Pours a pitch black color with dark caramel colored head. Some dark lacing clings but not much.
There is a nice hefty coffee aroma begining the nose, followed by sweet chocolate and a touch of maple syrup. The bourbon hasnt really impacted this brew much besides adding just a hint of vanilla and oak.
The taste is again coffee forward with a great smooth milk chocolate taste. The maple is noticed for a brief moment and but is mainly blended with the chocolate and coffee. This is incredibly drinkable as the abv is completely masked.
The mouthfeel is chewy and stcky, coating my palate with joy. Chewy and smooth, decadent and delicious. 
Overall, like it a bit better on tap as the coffee has faded just a bit to bring out more characteristics. 801 charactersChugginOil, Dec 01, 2011

A - This beer pours a very dark brown color, almost black. A vigorous pour yields almost 2-figners of dark tan head. The head has good retention, and it leaves some sticky scattered lace behind on the glass. 
S - The nose starts off with a nice dark roasted malt aroma. There is quite a bit of dark chocolate and coffee here too. Also, I am getting some aromas of maple syrup, oak, toffee, vanilla, and some smokey bourbon. 
T - The taste starts off with a big helping of dark roasted malts, dark chocolate, and coffee. There is a strong bourbon flavor, as well as a bunch of caramel and toffee. The maple syrup is definitely detectable. There is also some oak, vanilla, and a little bit of hop presence. The finish leaves some lingering roasted malt bitterness, bourbon, coffee, dark chocolate, and maple syrup flavors on the palate. 
M - This has a pretty full body and good carbonation. It goes down smooth, and it has a super rich, velvety smoothness to it. It also has a bit of an oily quality. There is a good amount of sweetness and plenty of roasted malt flavor to balance it out. There is a bit of boozy warmth on the back end, as well as some lingering bitterness. 
O - This has awesome drinkability. It is without a doubt a sipper, but everything about this beer is just outstanding. This is one of those beers that certainly lived up to the hype. It is just an all around world class beer. I highly recommend trying this one out. I would definitely pick more of it up, and I would love to try it on-tap. I am very thankful for being able to try this one. This is another wonderful beer from the awesome guys at Founders. Cheers guys. 1,662 charactersJizackFH, Nov 30, 2011

A: Nearly pitch black with a small amount of light penetrating the edges. A half inch of mocha colored head hangs around for about a minute or so and the lacing is pretty bad ass (I assume it's from the residual sugars).
S: The smell is of quality coffee, cocoa nibs, wood notes and a layer of sweetness that would most likely be the maple syrup. As the beer warms the alcohol moves into the forefront.
T: Taste is of coffee and milk chocolate with maple and oak in the finish. A bit sweet in the finish, I would not mind a little more bitterness to balance out the massive amount of sweetness brought on by the maple syrup.
M: Thick, creamy and a little sticky. Like dessert in a glass. 
O: I really enjoy this beer but think that KBS is more fit for me. Being as it is not as sweet and has a bit more of a bite and a barrel character that I enjoy. Cheers to Founders for their craftsmanship. An all around solid beer 1,017 charactersArchEnemyBrew, Nov 29, 2011

Appearance - Black as night with some ruby tones around the edges, very thin head, and little carbonation.
Smell - Coffee, coffee and more coffee, with hints of chocolate, roasted malts, and a bit of heat. As it warms I get hints of the maple smell, but I thought it would be much more forward than this.
Taste - You guessed it more coffee. Also quite hot and noticeably sweeter than it's KBS counterpart. The barrel tones are there, some oak and bourbon sting mostly, slight vanilla. Also notes of the roasty malts and chocolate fudge, the sweetness is quite apparent, again the maple flavors came out more as it continued to warm, but not as up front as it was in Nemesis 2009. Slightly disappointing.
Mouthfeel - slightly thicker than KBS, but again borders on absolutely perfect.
Overall - I have to admit, while this is a great beer, I personally think that KBS is just a flat out better beer. Would I seek this out again, yes, I would love to age this and revisit it, but I would not go through all the hoops again to get a bottle. 1,111 characterspmoore311, Nov 28, 2011

A: An extremely dark brown, almost black like appearance with a dark brown head. A viscous appearance.
S: The maple, choclate, and bourbon seemed most prevalent, with slight hints of the coffee. One of the most appealing smelling beers conceived.
T: Hard to describe. So smooth and balanced. The choclate and maple is definitly there producing a very sweet flavor. The bourbon seemed hardly noticeable to me due to it being so smooth and balanced and it being a very sweet beer.
Mouthfeel: Thick and creamy as one would expect. It seemed to be the perfect thickness and viscosity to support the flavors.
Overall: It is an amazing beer and definitly one of the best beers I have ever had. Next goal is to head up to founders to get it on tap. 955 charactersgordonbeersch, Nov 28, 2011

Pours a burnt wood black with a deep mocha head that sticks around. Such a pretty beer. 
Ok here we go. The nose has the follow: cocoa, dark chocolate, bourbon, oak, vanilla, maple syrup, cinnamon, brown sugar...etc etc. Absolutely stunning. World Class
The taste is unrivaled except by a few of the best stouts out. Unbelievable balanced, boozy but not overwhelming. Incredibly smooth and silky. Not to be missed. Everything that the nose had married together wonderfully. 
The biggest impression that this left on me was how good it was out of the bottle. I have had my problems with KBS out of the bottle vs. draft but this tasted as good if not better than the draft version. Excellent. 854 charactershippityhops85, Nov 25, 2011

The complexity of this beer is nearly unrivaled among the imperial stouts I have tried. 
Normally, certain beers are excellent, but kind of hit you in a single way. Think like the bourbon in Rare or the sweet chocolate in Dark Lord. With CBS it is like a symphony of flavors, you get the chocolate, then you might get the bourbon, then the maple shows through.
Wonderful, wonderful beer, this one is truly special. 474 charactersAdamostella, Nov 25, 2011

A: Pours a pitch black color - aggressive center pour leads to a 3 finger mocha colored head that disappeared after about 5 minutes and left relatively inconsistent, yet plentiful lacing. Very pretty beer.
S: Coffee, cocoa, toasted malts, vanilla, oak and maple-toffee notes round out one of the most complex noses I've ever had the pleasure of smelling. I could jump into the glass and swim in the aroma of this beer.
T: Follows the nose almost directly with all of the flavors intertwining into, again, one of the more complex, yet balanced flavors. ABV makes its way through here in warmth that is preceded by a solid nutty flavor that's unidentifiable. 
M: Creamy, perfectly carbonated, wonderfully warm. Aftertaste lingers and leaves me wanting more and more yet, wanting to sip and savor each and every flavor.
O: Good lord. All aboard the hype-train - this beer is the real deal. Easy the best, most complex stout I've ever had. World class for sure. 1,085 characterssuspect, Nov 25, 2011

Stand alone an amazing beer. Great mouthfeel. Had a much higher sugary/sweetness content compared to KBS and a much shorter finish. May be attributed to the 8 months more age on the KBS. I hate to say it, but I honestly would choose to drink KBS over this CBS, although I covet both of them more then any other beer. I am lucky enough to have two more bottles of CBS that I can lay down for some time and do this again. 530 charactersgbbass16, Nov 24, 2011

Pours an opaque black with a dense 3 inch foamy dark khaki head that settles to a small cap. A nice latticework of lace sticks to the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, coffee grounds, cocoa powder, dark chocolate, and maple syrup. Taste is of dark roasted malt, maple syrup, coffee beans, dark chocolate syrup, and a bit of alcohol. There is a nice roasty/cocoa bitterness on the finish that lingers on the tongue and a slight alcohol burn in the back of the throat. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Overall, this is an exceptional beer that completely lives up to its hype. Hands down, one of tne of the best stouts I have ever had. 748 charactersUCLABrewN84, Nov 24, 2011

Look: Black and totally opaque with a 1 inch tan head and fantastic retention and lots of amazing lacing
Smell: Roasted malts that are intertwined with maple syrup that is then backed up by a very nice chocolate and bourbon note
Taste: Lots of dark chocolate that reminds of you of a fresh batch of chocolate chocolate brownies midway through the beer you get a nice touch of oak and maple syrup that compliments the sweetness from the chocolate nicely. The beer finishes with the perfect amount of bourbon

Aroma is slightly sweet. Dark grain, chocolate, and coffee really stand out along with bourbon alcohol heat. 
Taste is initially rich chocolate and coffee. Then a sublime combination off vanilla and maple, along with a pleasant oak quality. Tobacco and brown sugar really rounds the flavor out. Finishes with bourbon heat that lingers that really complements the the chocolate and oaky vanilla notes.
Mouthfeel is full bodied, creamy and smooth. 
A rich and flavorful stout. Very interesting, but not overpowering in intensity. Instead there is layers of subtle flavor notes that peak through, especially as it warms and the bourbon asserts a stronger presence. Very nice. 746 charactersBlakaeris, Nov 20, 2011

Pours an ink black with a small, bubbly mocha colored head. Not much retention, and some bubbly lace around the edges.
The nose is sugary sweet overall. Coffee, maple syrup, dark roast, and bourbon. A pretty luxurious nose, not overly broad, but definitely deep. Some fusel alcohol sneaks up on you after some time.
Bourbon up front before maple syrup and fresh coffee grounds take over. The coffee grounds lend a pleasing bitterness that lasts forever. The maple and bourbon really pronounce themselves as this guy warms. Room temp is where this guy shines.
Luxurious and smooth. Creamy in all the right spots. The mouthfeel on the elite stouts is where they separate themselves and this beast is no exception.
This is a pretty fantastic beer, but I am not sure it necessitates all of the hype. The maple does a nice job adding to the beer and working with all of the other players. Well crafted on all fronts. 951 charactersColForbinBC, Nov 20, 2011

Pitch black. Rich, oily, glass coating viscosity. Amazing foamy light brown head with the best retention I've ever seen on a beer. It lasts pretty much forever if you move the glass which inevitable. 
Very nice nose full of chocolate brownie, light coffe and maple syrup. 
Flavor is stupid good. Amazing balance, very easy to drink. Lovely smoky-maple, rich but not overly sweet chocolate brownie or more like a flourless chocolate cake and nice balanced coffee notes make up the flavor characteristics. 
The mouthfeel has a wonderful velvetty and creamy viscosity that's coats the palate perfectly. Full bodied with low carbonation. 
Overall it's one beer that absolutely lives up to the hype. A very well made stout I'd love to get some more of. Can't wait to try it again. 852 charactersMrVonzipper, Nov 20, 2011

Appearance: Pours very black and dark with a moderate amount of bubbles. Decent two fingers of tan head that retains for a bit than fades into a thin patchy cream layer. Lacing is moderate around the glass. 
Smell: A big aroma of dark chocolate and bitter coffee with lots of dark roasted malts with notes of caramel and toffee. Also some hints of vanilla, woody bourbon, oak, and a little bit of dark fruits. Maple syrup is noticeable but pretty subtle. Alcohol also smells pretty tame. Chocolate and coffee stand out the most here. 
Taste: Like the nose indicates, a big bold taste of dark chocolate and coffee up front with dark roasted caramel and toffee malts. Midway comes some hints of vanilla and plumy dark fruits. A moderate boozy taste of bourbon wood and oak starts to come through and adds a little heat. Maple syrup comes in towards the finish adding some sweetness. The chocolate, coffee, and malts blend into the bourbon characteristics very well making for a very bold and balanced taste. 
Mouthfeel: Very full bodied with a moderate level of carbonation. Very roasty, creamy, and sticky. Alcohol heat is hidden pretty well for a barrel aged stout. Sticky syrup lingers in the mouth. 
Overall: A great imperial stout that deserves the hype it gets. The chocolate, coffee, and barrel aged characteristics are very bold without becoming overbearing. 1,446 charactersMattyG85, Nov 20, 2011

Strongly brewed coffee mixes with some milk chocolate. The maple shows its head, but imparts only a subtle sweetness. Charred oak and boozy bourbon flavors, with just a slight alcohol heat.

A: Black, thick, syrupy and viscous, chocolate brown with a chocolate mousse-ish looking thin head of foam.
N: Chocolate covered cherries hits me right away, that gives way to cocoa, spices, powdered sugar, bakers chocolate, rich buttery notes. A relly defined sweetness that isn't necessarily cloying but somehow just right, reminds me of smelling cookie batter. A touch of maple smokiness, some candi sugar, sugary fruits like overripe banana and something like, can't put my finger on it, like pie cherries or even blueberry? Suggestions of pastry and vanilla wafers.
T/M: A dense bourbony to maple sweetness rests in the back of the palate and stays all night! Such thick chocolate malt character that toes the line to being unbalanced, but it's not man...shit is just right! Maple sugar, whole milk or like heavy cream silkiness, chocolate mousse (great call from my buddy), smokey vanilla, vanilla extract, more of the cookie dough and pastry notes; and like the great line of Founders big stouts, the alcohol is well hidden except there is a slight bourbony alcohol burn in the finish. The maple sweetness makes way for notes of breadiness, graham cracker, rice pudding or even burnt marshmallow. Reminds me of smores.
D: Just a great fucking imperial stout. Pair it with food, don't pair it with food...it doesn't matter. 1,456 charactersbiga7346, Nov 18, 2011

A: Pours black with thin light brown head that leaves some lacing around glass.
S: Roasted malt, high alcohol is quite apparent, some chocolate and coffee notes are there but it is hard to pick up very much through all the alcohol.
T: Very rich, lots of roasted malt with some oak, chocolate and coffee with hints of sweet vanilla and maple. Not nearly as much alcohol as in the nose. Maple syrup and vanilla flavors come through a lot more as it warms. Fantastic!
M: Smooth and creamy full body, each little sip coats my entire mouth. Nice and thick, nearly perfect for the style.
O: Fantastic imperial stout, the maple bourbon barrel aging adds some amazing and unique complexities to what is likely an already amazing base stout. Easily one of the best imperial stouts that I have ever had. 854 charactersAzurescens, Nov 18, 2011

A: Near pitch black with a light chocolate colored head with decent retention. Lacing is decent but slightly oily. Over time, head is reduced to a small mocha ring around the edges.
S: Nose is maple syrup, chocolate, vanilla. Coffee is there but tucked away in the background...barely noticeable on the nose really. 
T&M: On the front there is a sweetness from the malt, chocolate and maple syrup, then it opens to some vanilla and slight raisin like fruitiness with a slight touch of coffee on the finish. Didn't notice much bourbon. Very easy to drink. Mouthfeel is luscious and smooth, no astringency or overly roasty tones, just a nice smooth chocolatey/mapley stout. 
O: I think this is my first commercial stout brewed with maple syrup and am pleasantly surprised. Tasted great - the maple syrup wasn't overwhelming in it's contribution to the sweetness and the chocolate/bourbon/coffee were well represented also. My only complaint would be no noticeable bourbon character or oakiness, although I may have already been sufficiently intoxicated by the time this was pouring :) 1,175 charactersjulian, Nov 17, 2011

4oz. tasting
Jet black with no hues visible. Thin tan head than lingers.
Nose has cocoa, vanilla, and roasted notes.
My mouth was watering as I waited to sip. I was not let down. Super smooth. I mean silky smooth with enough mouthfeel to coat the coat on my tongue. Maple up front that leads into the bourbon notes. Plenty of roasted malt characters to keep it honest and a spice that runs throughout. There was a milk chocolate sweetness without being cloying. More vanilla and some raisin/prune notes that remind you it's imperial. Simply delicious and once the 4oz was gone I wanted more.
So thankful to have tried this. I'd love to set a bottle away and try it after a year or two. Draft would be great as well. I'm not advocating the stealing of someone else's bottle but this is a must try. 891 charactersstewart124, Nov 17, 2011

Wow, the taste is phenomenal. Chocolate, coffee, maple, vanilla, bourbon, and toffee. Blends together perfectly. Sweet, with just enough bitterness from the coffee to make this perfect. There are layers upon layers of flavor to this beer. As the beer warms, the chocolate tastes more and more like Hershey's syrup.
Full bodied with modest carbonation. Smooth, silky, and creamy. What more can you ask for? Thanks to Founders, for bottling this great beer. 630 charactershardy008, Nov 16, 2011

Head is very creamy, aromas of maple and coffee creep up out of the glass nestled in cocoa and a bourbon heat. Flavor is spot on, although this beer doesnt really shine until it has warmed up completely to room temp, I would't even refridgerate this badboy. The maple is slightly subdued and the coffee roast and chocolate take the forefront. Finishes with a slight bourbon bite, but it is mellowed with the slight sweetness of the maple that just barely pokes it's head out. Overall, this is a sexy beer. I think that a lot of this b.s. about maple fading will be proven wrong with this beer. I predict the coffee mellowing first and allowing the maple and chocolate sweetness to shine. Only time will tell. 808 charactersTripphop, Nov 15, 2011

4.85/5  rDev +4.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I stopped in to the sterling Sun Singer in Champaign, IL for some of their magnificent selections. As I pondered whether or not to get ST Pumpking, Founders Breakfast Stout, or North Coast Pranqster, Brian the outstanding manager accosted me and said he had something waiting for me. He emerged from the back room and, tucked behind his left side, was a bottle of this beauty, Founders CBS. I was dumbstruck not just by his thoughtfulness, for I am working out of town and have not been back in over a month, but also that he managed to keep one of his last two bottles of this gem for me. Before reviewing this brilliant beer, it is just this kind of thoughtfulness, to say nothing of their first-rate beer selection and service, that makes Sun Singer a must-stop for anyone in Champaign who loves great beer. The people who work there and run it rank right there with the beer they sell, and that is no small claim.
Founders CBS was $19.99 for a bomber bottle. After enjoying this--at that after vowing in vain to save it for the Christmas holiday but folding after all of 12 hours--I can honestly say it was well worth it. I feel the same way about this relative to the cost as I did after forking over $17 for a sixer of Bell's HopSlam--a pretty penny, but worth every cent.
The body is lost-in-abyss black, so beautiful and lush, with a dark mocha patch of foam resting atop. Ample lacing and nice duration make this a beautiful beer to look at even before trying it.
The smells require their own paragraph, and usually in my reviews I tend to blend the appearance and smell sections. Founders CBS, however, has so much to offer the nose that it merits considerable attention: the bourbon is potent and at the forefront, with loads of vanilla bean, roasted coffee, and dark chocolate in tow. Complex and rich, without being overpowering.
I have had so many great stouts that adding others to the list immediately complicates what is already a feisty best-in-show argument. CBS must take a place in the top 10 best Imperial Stouts I have ever had, no question. It is SOOO rich and complex that the tastes change in emphasis by the mouthful. The real beauty of CBS is how, despite the prominent and powerful Canadian whiskey flavor and aroma, the whiskey envelopes the beer while providing sufficient space for other flavors to emerge. Vanilla plays a significant role in CBS, much to my pleasure. Chocolate and French press-style coffee make their presence felt. In the first half of CBS, there were mouthfuls of undeniable...sweetness...that were so satisfying that I was simply blown away. Cherry and vanilla, like sweet ice cream with a slight bitter finish. The second half of CBS drinks like a VSOP cognac--strong with some alcohol heat, but with non-cloying sweetness as well, like booze-soaked cherries. This is magnificent, utterly, bleeping magnificent.
The mouthfeel is almost as fabulous: creamy, smooth, with some bitterness in the finish and a booziness that some might find off-putting. I, on the other hand, just love that whiskey oak flavor and residue, that teeth-licking goodness from a mouth full of well-hopped, caked-on malty, whiskey soaked beer. 
Undeniably a sipper, CBS is the kind of beer that at once could justify the older BA rating system incorporating drinkability, for this is a mouthful at a time beer that is gargantuan, while also allowing for the newer rating system (which I prefer) replacing drinkability with an overall assessment of a beer favoring a beer's constitutive qualities over the speed at which one consumes it. CBS is smack-in-the-head strong, at the same time that it allows one the time to ponder its complex greatness. And great it is. CBS is the kind of brawny giant of a beer that reminds me of Great Divide Old Ruffian, a bruiser that can go toe-to-toe with any big beer out there. And yet CBS has a complexity and smoothness (not unlike Old Ruffian, despite their shared brawn and grit) that should make beer lovers pause and ponder. 
Founders CBS might be the second-best beer I have tried in 2011, right behind Founders KBS. Yet again, in yet another Founders beer review of mine, I cannot help but extol the virtues of this top-shelf brewery, one of the five best on the planet in my opinion. Founders, like their brilliant CBS, can go toe-to-toe with anyone because it concocts bottled brilliance such as Sappy Slappy, CBS, Curmudgeon, KBS, Nemesis, Double Trouble, Breakfast Stout and on and on. 
Sublime stuff. Thanks, Brian. I owe you one. 4,516 charactersGehrig, Nov 15, 2011

4.77/5  rDev +3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5I've been waiting for this guy for a while. I'm a lucky man to get a bottle of this. My GF and I enjoyed our first small pours of this with pancakes!
Appearance: Black with brown edges. I see a nice amount of rich coffee head form with each swirl. Nothing that sticks around, but it lets you know that it isn't so thick that nothing is going to be overwhelmingly viscous.
Aroma: Bourbon is the primary smell. Hints of complex maltiness come out. Some black chocolate types of notes along with a hefty dose of bitterness on the nose. It needs to open up a bit before the maple sweetness comes into play. Very nice beer to ponder with your nose.
Taste: Very similar to the nose in that it is all at once complex, but evolves throughout the drinking experience. A lot of bourbon flavor up front, but not so much hot like other bb-aged brews. A hefty bitterness comes into play on the secondary. Lots of dark chocolate and rich espresso notes. But the maple is the real star here. It doesn't whack you over the head with its presence and is really not overly sweet. It almost whaffs into your mouth on the swallow and develops a great aftertastes that balances out the strong bourbon tones and bitterness. After a while in the glass, the flavors meld very well. The maple comes forth more in the initial taste and blends well with the other flavors mentioned before. An amazingly developed and tasty brew.
Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Thick and heavy, yet the body is light enough to allow your palette to appreciate the nuances this guy offers. This is the perfect beer to enjoy in small pours over the course of the evening. I had three different small doses of this and really had different, altogether remarkable experiences with each.
Overall: This one fits the bill and delivered on the hype. I was a little unsure how it would all come together without clashing, but it is a marvel in that it tastes great, but is extremely nuanced and evolves with each taste. 1,963 characterssoze47, Nov 14, 2011
4.4/5  rDev -5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Well, here it goes. Thanks to woodchopper! 
Thanks to my wife, for letting me open this with her!
A: pours black with brown hedging. A gaudy mocha top slowly falls to a solid sheet of lighter mocha. Spotty lace. Pretty beer.
S: Getting the bourbon, not getting the maple so much. Smells malty, dark, with hints of coffee. Smells really good....After a few more minutes, the maple starts to come out and reminds me of maple butternut ice cream.
T: Dark chocolate ice cream, hints of sweet bourbon, flecks of toffee, coffee and not really much maple. Then when I swallow on the subsequent exhalation, I get a really nice rush of the maple. There is just the slightest heat from the alcohol here.
M: Viciously sticky with a full feel and just perfect carbonation. The finish is lasting and combative with my preferred reservation to savor this beer rather than gulp it. This beer has perfectly matched feel for the profile. Only other beer with such a profoundly matched mouthfeel I've had is Hunahpu's.
O: Well, this beer is really really good. The maple tones are subdued with initial tastes, and then initiate their subtle bellicose intents to compel my idle hands to guzzle. Good shit, I expected it to be sweeter, and was pleasantly surprised. I am grateful to have been able to try this one. I would love to have again, and wouldn't pass up an opportunity. A perfect dessert for this accompaniment would be a hot fudge sundae with peanut brittle bits mixed into a rich, high quality vanilla bean ice cream...After which I would probably be sick to my stomach from such a degree of extravagance. 1,598 charactersharrymel, Nov 13, 2011
4.75/5  rDev +2.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5An oily thick viscous black pour glugs out of the bottle and into my snifter. A healthy brown head appears and then turns into a nice halo on my glass. Aroma is immediately of maple and chocolate. Taste is of sweet maple, brownie batter and some oaky-vanilla.As it warms the coffee flavor shines through. What I like is it doesn't taste like the burnt coffee flavor I got from the FBS. For as thick and syrupy these flavors sound this beer has such a nice light drinkability... even though its flavors coat the mouth and linger quite long. This beer is amazing but the availability of it drives me crazy. I wish I could get it a little easier... but that might take away from the experience. Overall this is a perfect stout and I would change nothing about it. (except its availability). 787 charactersstabzmcgee, Nov 13, 2011

Thanks for sharing, Rich and brew3crew!
**The 2008 hand-bottle was significantly better than the fresh bottle. This is my review of the hand-bottle.**
(Aged for 3 years)
Thick and black throughout with a thin layer of light brown crown atop. This is a sticky and thick looking stout, and leaves the glass messy with spots of lacing down the glass.
A divine, complex, and evolving aroma: roasted malt, coffee, rich bourbon, and some sweet maple and vanilla, especially at room temperature. 
The taste follows the aroma, but it's even more complex and evolving as the beer progresses from chilled, to cellar, to room temperatures. Initially, this seems very similar to KBS, but as it warms, the vanilla and maple notes emerge more and more, leaving behind something perfect.
Medium to thick mouthfeel with low carbonation. Smooth and incredibly drinkable.

4.97/5  rDev +7.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5One of my good friends and I lucked out this past week. I received a bottle of Founders Canadian Breakfast Stout and he bought two bottles of Pliny the Elder. We had the most epic beer tasting afternoon ever. We began with the famous beer from the Russian River Brewing company and ending with the CBS.
Appearance- Black, opaque, and minimal lacing and head. Not much carbonation visually. 
Smell- Strong chocolate, roasted coffee, maple syrup, and dark malt notes. Weaker bourbon smell. Has a earthy nutty aroma that lingers slightly. 
Taste- This was an ideal/perfect stout. A lot smoother than the traditional breakfast stout and a differently more pronounced maple taste. The bourbon taste isn't as strong as the Backwoods Bastard. All of the aromas come out in the taste, each one being highly distinguishable, balanced so well. 
Mouthfeel- Very filling and heavy. Medium to heavy bodied beer. Carbonation in the beer is not as intense but it builds a frothiness on the back end that accents the flavors "frothy goodness".
Overall- The best beer I've ever had to date. Actually bought tears to my eyes. The flavors and smell, each flavor so pronounced and the body of the brew so perfect. This brew embodies the definition of breakfast stout!

Deep reddish hues in the legs and on the edges... Sand colored dark tan head. Nice thick legs. Huge chunks of spotty lace. 
Smells like coffee. Coffee rules the nose here, but where's the maple syrup action?
Coffee rocks the flavor too... Very boozy, with roasted coffee flavor, some sweet malt, and a big coffee-flavored boozy bite.
This is nowhere near as good as I remember it being on tap-- too boozy, too much coffee (I like coffee, but this reminds me of "stale" coffee-- not fresh and strong). 
Pretty thick feel-- but it's oily and slick. 
Overall, this is NOT the same beer I remembered. I'm actually pretty disappointed in this one. It isn't "bad," but it is not "world class."
WAAAY too hot on the back end. (and bear in mind, I like big stouts. I'm not some BMC guy on his 4th review). 837 charactersAleWatcher, Nov 12, 2011

Pretty good overall. Poured like motor oil with little head and lacing. Good nose to this one, I picked up more on the chocolate rather than the coffee, maple syrup, or bourbon. Big heavy SWEET beer. This thing was a dessert beer for sure...It tasted like a shot of hershey's chocolate syrup. Alcohol was hidden very well, considering the 10.6% EtOH content. Overall it was a good beer BUT I'm not big on big sweet syrup beers so...I am glad that I can say that I've tried it, but not my fav. Cheers! 608 charactersbyrdman16, Nov 12, 2011

A: Pours thick pitch black with three fingers of dense and creamy looking dark brown head that took forever to fade into a thin bubbly film leaving spots and streak of soapy lacing down the glass. 
S: Dominant notes of rich drip coffee and roasted coffee beans with hints of sweet molasses, spicy bourbon barrel, and a touch of vanilla. This is one potent and fragrant beer. 
T: Rich notes of coffee, sweet chocolate, vanilla, thick molasses, spicy bourbon and a touch of oak. Flavors are rich and decadent. The alcohol is completely hidden. The finish is sweet and full of raisins, and the aftertaste is syrupy sweet with lingering flavors of bourbon, chocolate syrupy and molasses. The coffee dominates in this beer, but the maple and chocolate add a beautiful sweetness. 
M: Soft, tingly carbonation, rich and sweet mouthfeel, and a thick body that is definitely thick, but not the thickest I’ve had. 
O: A truly decadent and rich sipper of a beer. There are few imperial stouts that I would put above this one (although there are one or two). This beer is definitely worth the hype. Thank you so much for the bottle, Jay. 1,228 charactersscottfrie, Nov 12, 2011
4.83/5  rDev +4.3%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5750ml Bottle poured into my Duvel tulip and shared with a friend. 
Appearance: Deep dark reddish brown with surprisingly large frothy tan head of about a 3” that recedes to a healthy 1” and hangs around. Excellent sticky lacing. Since most barrel aged stouts yield little to no head this is quite different possibly the best looking barrel aged stout I have ever seen.
Smell: Sweet chocolate with coffee underneath and hints of whiskey, highly complex. Much more complex than FBS and KBS, also not as “bourbon forward” as KBS.
Taste: Wow, much better than expected, I thought it would be good but I didn’t honestly expect it to be this great. The sweetness imparted by the maple sugar is unique and in perfect balance with the coffee, chocolate, and whiskey flavors. I don’t know if I would have pinpointed the sweetness as “maple” but it was definitely unique and incredibly delicious. The beer was poured at below room temperature (around 50 degrees I would estimate) and I wondered if the sweetness would change as the beer warmed and possibly become mouth coating and cloying. I drank this beer very slowly (as I had done a horizontal tasting and was drinking a 2011 FBS & a 2011 KBS at the same time) and as it warmed it got better, and better, never falling below excellent, and never cloying in the least bit.
Mouthfeel: Creamy smooth on the palate with a mildly bitter finish that left the mouth clean.
Overall: I did not expect that this beer would live up to its reputation. It is the best stout of any kind that I have ever had; period (blew KBS & FBS away with ease). I don’t know if I’ll ever get the chance to have it again but I’m glad I was lucky enough to get this opportunity. 1,721 charactersBobZ, Nov 11, 2011
4.92/5  rDev +6.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Pours black with solid head and lacing. Good retention as well.
The aroma is bourbon and maple and hoppy and roasty. All in that order. The aroma commands your attention and hints at the depth of the drink. 
Maple is far less sweet than imagined. It's not so much a maple syrup flavor as it is a maple flavor. Long after the sip chocolate come to the front. A splash of bourbon carries the flavor and is around for the entirety of the experience. It's somewhat foundational without being boozy or in your face. 
The complexity of the drink is immense. The bourbon is rich and has minimal heat. Roastiness is extremely smooth. The flavors merge tremendously well and none of them steal the attention from the others. 
The mouthfeel is full and smooth. Carbonation is quite adequate but strong enough to be easy. The finish is mildly dry and very sticky, presumably from the maple. I remember the mouthfeel being just a tad creamier on the tap version. 
Overall, this is likely the best beer I've ever had. There's so much richness with such subtle intensity. I'd recommend it to anybody. I'm extremely grateful that Founders made this beer available to a much bigger audience finally. I was lucky enough to try this on tap and in bottle format and I think I'd give the edge to the tap version, although it was fresher. 
Aging is not recommended. 1,350 charactersBBP, Nov 10, 2011

Beer smells a little smokey. The syrup is detectable, which makes it even better and makes me want to eat pancakes. The dark chocolate and toffee are evident.
The maple syrup is just as easy to taste as it is to smell, but it's not overbearing. This beer is so smooth because it's so balanced.
Beer sits well on the palate although the alcohol is a little abrupt.
So glad i got to try this. Aasher made sure i didn't miss out on buying this, and it did not fail in the least bit. 592 characterszep9865, Nov 10, 2011

from notes. served in a snifter.
a - black as night with a thin film of dark brown head on top. leaves only a few small spots of lacing.

m - thick and rich but exceptionally smooth. only a slight alcohol burn.
o - certainly a great beer, but i don't understand the hysteria. i would definitely not pay more than $30 for a bottle of this, and that's pushing it. i did a side by side with kbs at founders black party last year and found the differences to be minimal (cbs being just a tad sweeter). 699 charactersdivineaudio, Nov 09, 2011

Appearance: Pours a viscous black with a thick creamy brown head about a finger thick that lingers and slowly fades to a ring around the center. 
Aroma: Holy hell! Chocolate, vanilla, marshmellow, coffee, bourbon, oak, maple, and even a hint of smoke. The coffee is still strong but not over powering as is the maple. 
Taste: I want to freeze it and skate on it in the winter! Incredibly complex with coffee, chocolate, vanilla, maple, bourbon seamlessly blended to perfection. 
Mouthfeel: Velvety smooth without a sense of alcohol, my only complaint would be the sweetness, but this is what you get when you add maple.
Overall: Amazing beer and really grateful that I got to try it. I would rather have a 4 pack of KBS but as a treat I would certainly enjoy a CBS. 877 charactersjamescain, Nov 09, 2011
4.55/5  rDev -1.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Had this as a special tapping at Cloverleaf Tavern in Cadlwell, NJ. Poured into small snifters, it only took nine minutes to kick the sixtel. My goal here was to determine if this was really worth all the hype and jostling to get a glass.
Nearly jet black with the usual mocha-colored foam of an imp stout that stood over 1/4" through the whole glass. Quite lovely, as was the smell. Chocolate and coffee wafted up from the roasted malts, which a sweet touch to it that I couldn't get my finger on immediately. The guys around me were equally perplexed but then we realized it had a little bit of licorice to it. This seemed to come from the sweetness (like dark maple ssyrup) playing with the alcohol. A touch of vanilla appeared as I sadly approached the end of the snifter. I enjoyed every last, luscious drop of this well-brewed stout. The body is dead-on perfect, silky and viscous all at once, giving every inch of your mouth tender attention as it delivers its complex flavors.
Worth the hype? Yeah, it was pretty much worth having to lean up against something in the bar because all the seats were occupied. Makes me really upset that I missed the KBS tapping now. 1,174 charactersNaugros, Nov 08, 2011
4.56/5  rDev -1.5%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A - Fairly thick and jet black. Beautiful creamy tan head. Sticky lacing. An absolutely gorgeous stout.
S - A nice bouquet of Cocoa, fresh roasted coffee beans and some maple peaking through. Booze comes through at the end.
T - A contrast of dark and milk chocolate prevail. Rich coffee beans add flavor and bitterness which contrasts with the sweet maple syrup that comes through at the end and stays through the finish. Some vanilla and cinnamon there too. Booze is there but not overwhelming. The flavors components shine independently but blend so perfectly to create a creamy and rich chocolaty/mocha/maple compound that is all its own, not like any other beer or style I've tasted.
M - Full bodied and a little syrupy when gulped (although why would anyone want to gulp this?) but when it's swirled around my mouth it becomes so incredibly smooth and creamy. Can't think of many beers that are as velvety.
O - Incredibly rich, sweet, and decadent. It absolutely lives up to the hype. This is one of those rare "Wow" beer. When you take the first sip you can't help but blurt out"Wow!". 1,095 charactersBostonBrewins, Nov 08, 2011
4.92/5  rDev +6.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5This beer was the feature of a tap takeover at a local bar. They said that it would be tapped at 5pm. To ensure the opportunity to taste this world class beer, I arrived at the bar at 4:40 and placed my order. I was actually jittery on the ride over to the bar, and I was really nervous that I would get there too late for the opportunity for my own taste of CBS. The sixtel took nine minutes to get kicked. You had to order your beer before the first pour to get a glass. 
They used mini snifters to serve the six ounces of liquid heaven. You got beer as dark as midnight with a light, tan ring around the top. That scarce, little bit of foam left minimal lacing on this little glass. 
I smelled it and saw stars. I then breathed it in again. I could smell toffee, deep roasted espresso, a little touch of sweetness, a touch of maple, and I think... cocoa? I kept sniffing it in anticipation of the first drink. I could only wish that this beer tasted half as good as it smelled.
First taste: WOW!!!
I get a ton of smoothe espresso. There was a decent amount of sweetness present. You get some venous quality, and you can see the legs on the glass. I also picked up some cask flavor in the beer. This is extremely rich. I love that I got 6 ounces, but it seems like 12 is too much. All that was missing was an over-stuffed chair and a roaring fire place.
The after-taste was sublime. The coffee notes start to ease off. And the flavor just sits on the back of my tongue.
I don't think that I fawned too much over this beer. This Wale lived up to its billing. I hope that I can someday get another glass someday. 1,617 charactersummswimmin, Nov 08, 2011

Pour is Dark and thick. At first sniff, Coffee and espresso come out first, followed by vanilla and maple. A few swills and she comes to life. Small to medium caramel colored head and huge coffee notes. Lacing is thick and sticky. Wow, this beer taste amazing. Coffee followed by chocolate, vanilla and maple. Big balance of the hops and malt. You can tell that there is A LOT going on in this brew. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy. Not as heavy as I expected but extremely balanced. The alcohol is hidden as the coffee and roasted malt pack a huge punch. Finish is smooth and long. I really enjoyed this brew, although I don't understand all the craziness and drama surrounding it. It's just A BEER. Meant for sharing and drinking. If you get a chance please try one of these with some close friends! Cheers! 852 charactersBierGartenok, Nov 08, 2011

Appearance: poured into a 8oz snifter which was dark black and thick with a small fingers worth of head that lasted as I sipped on it.
Smells: I pick up a dark roasted coffee malt backbone with hints of sweet caramel and chocolate.
Tastes: a smooth subtle coffee base that blends with a bitter chocolate sweetness that is complimented with the barrel features like vanilla and toffee. Not a heavy roasted flavor like the nose made me believe.
Mouthfeel: for being an Imperial this stout is smooth and good drinking fresh. There is pretty good carbonation and a full body in the mouth as you drink it.
Overall: I am happy I got a chance to try this limited release, but I don't know if all the hype is as good as it is made out to be. Bottles were near impossible to get around me and the keg tapped out in 9 minutes where I had it. No doubt this is a great brew but I can not say it is out of this world compared to more readily available barrel aged stout. Good Job Founders just dial in the distribution better in my opinion, maybe 12oz bottle will go a lot farther. 1,158 characterskennylopez, Nov 08, 2011
4.3/5  rDev -7.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Enjoyed this one before going out to Novare with Brez07.
A: Pretty much what you'd expected, thick and dark with a smaller mocha cap.
S: Even though he had allowed the beer to warm on the counter before opening, we both agreed it got even better as it sat in our glass. Initial impression was bitter chocolate with a deep roasted character. As it began to open though the maple started to come out along with typical barrel notes of vanilla, oak, and spice. Its a lot more subtle than I had imagined
T: Once at the proper temperature it was really like a delicious glass of liquified chocolate covered espresso beans dipped in maple syrup. I was pleasantly surprised by the balance, I was really kind of expecting this one to be a little too syrupy and sweet, but the roasted coffee and bitter chocolate notes kept things in check.
M: Big and creamy. Full body means slightly lower carbonation, not really an issue though. Bitter drying finish goes well with the creamy body and maple notes.
O: This is one I have been wanting to try for a long time. Once the announcement of bottling came out I got really excited...then I saw the fiasco behind the release and had kind of given up on try this one. Really glad I've now lined up a bottle for myself. 1,255 charactersDrazzamatazz, Nov 07, 2011
4.92/5  rDev +6.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 511 ounce pour - $7.00 at The Fred in Sandy Springs, Georgia.
Appearance: Viscous-looking, deep black body with an initially surging head that soon settles to a quarter inch of deep tan froth. Sticky-looking lace sheets on the descent.
Smell: Presents a sweetish scent, rich and downright succulent with flourishing notes smelling of chocolate ganache, split vanilla beans, chunky caramel, chilled espresso, maple, and bourbon.
Taste: A deep surge of melty semi-sweet chocolate morsels combined with a heady coffee flavor and spoonful of maple frosting and caramel. Little hints of wood and amiable bourbon. It's fairly sweet without being too sweet and has a richness aided by the mouthfeel to give the impression of melted ice cream. It comes together very nicely, all of the flavors here are integral as well as well-integrated. Roasty bitterness here and there. A choco-roast flair prominent in the finish with a final sliver of sweet maple wrapped in alcoholic warmth.
Mouthfeel: Full-bodied. Medium-light carbonation. Silken, smooth mouthfeel.
Overall: After seeing once presumed good, honorable men turn into dire savage beasts over this greatly hyped beer release (in the same manner the Rings of Power created the Nazgûl), I was half expecting it to fall a bit flat, but, no, it's really quite wonderful. 1,318 charactersChainGangGuy, Nov 07, 2011

The smell of the beer is sweet and lightly roasted with some maple, chocolate and coffee aromas. The first sip is sensational, I couldn't believe how great this tasted. The blend of maple and coffee was fantastic. Such an interesting flavor it's hard to explain. The mouthfeel of this brew is creamy, thick and rich. Overall this beer is great.

S-Aroma of coffee is the most prominent with a slight aroma of sweetness and chocolate.
T-Strong flavor of bourbon up front with some caramel/maple syrup sweetness. Distinct flavors of coffee and chocolate. Lots of alcohol.
M-Very thick and sticky, very sweet, fairly light carbonation with a strong flavor of alcohol. Very very smooth.
Overall, I wasn't sure what to expect with the maple-bourbon barrel aging. This is a very heavy and thick beer with alot of sweetness. The combination of the maple and bourbon flavors seems to turn into a sort of caramel flavor. All the flavors you expect from Breakfast stout come through with the addition of the bourbon and maple syrup flavors. This is an exceptional beer, not only very interesting but very well done for the style. Incredibly smooth with lots of different flavors. I was very fortunate to get my hands on this one. 1,019 charactersadman08, Nov 06, 2011

Appearance – Poured into a sniffer from the bartender with a completely black color with slight tan head that dissipates quickly.
Smell – Coffee, cocoa, maple syrup, molasses, and bourbon. As it warms a wonderful vanilla aroma develops.
Taste – Ahh, so this is what I waited for in the cold for seven hours. This better taste good! Begins with roasted malts, coffee, and then becomes quite sweet. The maple syrup, bourbon, and brown sugar make this a hint cloying to be honest. Very sugary…
Mouthfeel – Medium bodied, creamy, slight carbonation.
Overall – What to think…I felt this was just too sweet. It is a solid imperial stout, no question. However, it just didn’t really do much for me to be perfectly honest. Obviously this is quite subjective and everyone’s experience will vary, though I just couldn’t get past the sweetness. I like a bit more char/roasted character throughout. To be honest, I would take KBS or FBS over this if I were enjoying a stout. However, if I were to share this as an after dinner beer I would choose this over the aforementioned beers. I suppose it boils down to my not liking overly sweet stouts. Would still love to try it again and as stated, for what it is, it is fantastic. Glad I was able to try a couple glasses on tap. 1,358 charactersSpdKilz, Nov 06, 2011

A- Excellent as can be expected. We both love KBS and this one looks similar.
S- The coffee is there and the stout is there, but the Maple kind of smooothes out the finish in the nose.
T- C'mon, what am I gonna say that hasn't already been said about this beer. One of the best beers in the world finished off in MAPLE BARRELS??? What are you, kidding me? It's like asking me if I was having sex with my wife and Sofia Vergara asks us if she can join us, as it would just make something great even better!

Poured a very dark deep black with a finger and a half medium mocha head that faded slowly into a thick cap with moderate lacing.
Aroma of coffee, chocolate, some malt and a very slight note of bourbon.
Taste followed the nose with dark roasted coffee, dark bitter chocolate, burnt malt with hints of bourbon. As it warmed some vanilla sweetness came through,however, I never picked up any maple flavor which was the only disappointment with this stout. 
Mouth Feel was full body, light carbonation, creamy smooth with a slight alcohol warming.
Overall this stout deserves all of the hype it receives. It would be nice if it was easier to obtain, I guess keeping it so limited adds to the enjoyment of savoring it.
I couldn't think of a better beer for 250th review. 958 charactersdtivp, Nov 04, 2011

I was hoping for some more maple presence but it's an excellent beer nonetheless. I'm glad it has lived up to the hype (unlike some other beers like Westy 12). I wish this was more readily available. I'm looking forward to next years version of CBS. 785 characterspratyk, Nov 04, 2011
4.62/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Appearance is nothing special. Looks like any other stout. 
Smell is of cocoa nibs, coffee, and whiskey. 
Taste is the same but smooth and rich. 
Mouth feel is velvety and rich. Like chocolate silk. But with whiskey. 
Overall this is exceptional but I wouldn't say it is better than KBS. It is good but I like KBS much more. 
Try it if you can but don't kill yourself for it. 380 charactersrwf08, Nov 04, 2011
4.83/5  rDev +4.3%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5The mysterious beast has finally been found! At Crunchy’s in East Lansing? Who would have thuk’ it?
This is one of the few beers that I have seen the rating on beeradvocate before trying it so I tried not to be biased.
A & S: The smell of this beer is truly described by intense. A very formidable smell of caramel, sweet burnt sugars, malty smokiness, and a splash of bourbon. The aroma is an ongoing invigorating part of the beer. Not a big head but I would say it was one, if not the coolest head. It formed a tan ring around the top of the inky black liquid, and in the center whisks of the head was where the magic happened. These whisks would form the most interesting shapes. It was like a shrunk showing you new inkblots ever time you took a sip. I saw smiley and frowny faces, MSU block “S”s, two kids skipping along, ect. it was weird to say the least. It wasn’t just the sniffer either cause I had a different beer after the CBS and it wasn’t even close to being the same. The lacing is very slight but reminds me of legs on a fine wine, that are trying their best to cling to the glass before falling back into the inky blackness.
T & M: At first I was disappointed that I could only have ½ a sniffer of this beer, but I would say that is an ok amount, I wouldn’t want anymore then a full sniffer at a time. This beer is incredibly rich with flavor. As far a major tastes go: upfront the taste is very sweet, this followed by a mighty bite of alcohol (cause a very pleasant warming sensation), trailed by a nice bitter finish. This beer is incredibly complex, those main tastes are just the surface. The smokiness in the taste is more of a woody smokiness (probably part of the aging). Other flavors include: black coffee, dark chocolates and fruits (dates), roasty malts, burnt sugars, and a sting of bourbon. These other flavors weren’t like in the background, they were all a major part of this beer. I was also getting a piney tone once in a while. The after taste was magical it leaves almost an exact imprint of the beer in your mouth which leaves you wanted more, while your brain tells you to savor every drop. Semi smooth and very chewy (my teeth felt actually gross it was so chewy). On the low end of full bodied, with moderate amounts of carbonation.
O: I had this beer yesterday, and I think this is the only beer I can’t get out of my mind, at least to this extent. It lives up to all the hype it gets and it is truly a special thing. Hands down my favorite stout and easily top 5 beers of all time. It might be a long while till I have this beer again, exclusively because of the price and availability of it. I was lucky enough to enjoy it on tap at a bar 2 blocks from where I live, many people search and search for this beer. The price is to say the least very high I’m unsure about how much people are paying for a pint of it (I think its quite high), but at Crunchy’s it was $8 for 6oz, and only one per customer. Anyways I would recommend this beer to anyone who enjoys trying good beer (this is just not a beer I would start someone unfamiliar with good beer out on, I feel they would feel disappointed about paying so much). I wish I had the money and resources to find and have this beer multiple time every winter, I keep picturing myself sipping a sniffer of this while seating in a leather recliner chair beside a toasty fire watching the wintering weather outside. 3,432 charactersminterro, Nov 03, 2011
4.26/5  rDev -8%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Nothing like drinking an faux insta-whale to the face. Ok, I poured a little out for my hommies, but mostly it was all me. Poured into none other than the trusty Founders snifter.
A - Pours black with a little light getting through the pour. Good, thick, tan head. This one looks great. Sticks to the glass when swirled, head continues to form when doing so. Honestly, this is one of the best looking stouts I've seen from start to finish in the glass. At first it was a 4.5, but I bumped it to a 5.0 after it sat in my glass for an hour and still looked fantastic. Of course, I was drinking it this entire time.
S - Coffee with a slight sweetness. There are some dark malts present with a slight amount of bourbon that backs the coffee. The aroma could be more dominant on this one. My true criticism of this beer is the lack of a dominant aroma. Pleasant, yes. Dominating, no. 
T - Malts/Chocolate meld into bourbon, which quickly turns sweet from the maple. The sweetness takes away the bite that was present momentarily in the middle of the flavor. Coffee finishes. After a couple sips, the bourbon and coffee are more evident upfront and the chocolate is more evident throughout. The bourbon to slight maple to coffee/sweet bourbon towards the end is pretty nice and interesting. There is just a tad bit of head in the middle before the sweetness picks up.
M - fairly thick, carries flavor, smooth/silky. Pretty good.
O - This is a great beer. My first few sips were not great if I'm being honest. It wasn't until about 6 ounces in that I began to really like this beer. I don't think it would fare that well at a blind tasting. Unique as well with the maple/bourbon barrel. It could also benefit from a better aroma. Would I seek this one out again? Yes. Would I recommend it? Yes. Would I go to a special release for it? Most likely. Would I follow distribution trucks/vans around Indiana to buy it from every store? No, those people are idiots. 1,957 charactersclaaark13, Nov 03, 2011
4.8/5  rDev +3.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5750ml bottle. I've had this numerous times on tap at the Brick Store, but might as well post a review for the bottled version.
Pours pitch black in the glass with an enormous mocha head, at least 3 inches thick, and leaves fantastic lacing.
Aroma is excellent with a combination of roasted coffee beans, cocoa and molasses. The bourbon is more subtle than KBS and I'm not sure if that's a positive or not. Nonetheless, intense aroma.
Taste is exceptional, just as I remember on tap and from growler. It's a bigger, more robust version of the aroma. There is plenty of coffee beans and heavily roasted malts with a thick, syrupy sweet finish with a bit of whiskey burn. Throw in some chocolate and vanilla and it's a wonderfully big flavor.
The mouthfeel is on the fuller side of things, very creamy with soft carbonation.
KBS is one of my top 5 beers ever probably, so I'm not sure if this is quite that sublime, but it's close. Fantastic stuff. 950 charactersgford217, Nov 02, 2011
4.27/5  rDev -7.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4On-tap at The Map Room for $7 a glass! Served in a snifter.
A- Pitch black with a thin bubbly brown head that leaves some spots of lacing.
S- Dark chocolate, roasted malt, burnt sugar, vanilla, sweet maple, subtle bourbon and a hint of dark fruit. Smells pretty damn amazing and changes as it warms up.
T- Roasted malt and a bit of coffee hit first, followed by sweet maple syrup, bourbon, dark chocolate chips, oak, and finishes with black cherries and some bitter and earthy hops with notes of pine and grass. 
M- Low carbonation and a full rich body with a bit of heat and bitterness that lingers on.
O- A pretty sweet stout with the maple syrup being noticeable. There is an odd bitterness (from the hops?) that lingers on in the aftertaste that hurts the drinkability overall. I'm very glad I had to chance to try this, but I prefer KBS. 847 charactersiadler, Nov 02, 2011
4.92/5  rDev +6.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Poured into a pint glass from a 750 bottle.
A - Pours out dark and magnificent with a brown/tan lacing and head. As others have noted, the head is fairly impressive.
S - Chocolatey coffee goodness with some maple syrup. Take a few whiffs and you'll also notice some vanilla and perhaps some cinnamon on the outskirts of smell along with a subtle bourbon. Absolutely perfect combination which makes you salivate like a dog. 
T - This is heaven in liquid form. Velvety smooth chocolate coffee with some maple syrup bourbon in the middle. It's like taking a bite of your favorite gourmet dark chocolate and pairing it with an aged bourbon. 
M - Surprisingly mellow on the tongue and mouth despite the high alcohol content. Very near perfect and tops just about every other beer I've tried. I could easily sip this all day. 
O - This is creamy, smooth, complex, but not overwhelming. It's like your best buddy beer - being everything you want it to be and more. Having a sad day? No problem, sip on a glass of CBS and watch your worries melt away. This is chocolatey, coffee, maple syrup, burbon aged perfection. 1,113 charactersSlyjoker87, Nov 01, 2011

The smell is very sweet, with note of coffee and chocolate and just a faint twinge of bourbon. The taste is (as a friend described it) "milkshake beer:" super sweet, though with some nice roasted notes from the coffee; chocolate flavors predominate, with a hint of maple; not much from the bourbon here. It's thick and creamy, with mild carbonation. All in all a nice beer, easy enough to drink for what it is. Glad to have had a chance to try it with friends. 518 charactersgory4d, Oct 31, 2011
4.4/5  rDev -5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 410/31/11
Poured a viscous black with a tiny tan head.
Aroma mostly consists of chocolate, bourbon and coffee. Not much maple in the nose.
Taste follows the nose. You can taste the barrel aging as the bourbon at times almost overpowers. Lots of chocolate and roasty malt flavor with a touch of vanilla and just a bit of maple syrup. Seems to have less maple presence than when it had it on tap at Founders.
Mouthfeel is just a touch thin for the style although far from watery. Lowish carb levels.
A fine beer, but it's impossible to live up to the crazy hype train. I slightly preferred the KBS we opened along with this and FWIW, it was a 2-2 tie between KBS and CBS as best beer amongst our tasting party.
[Edit] Cracked another bottle on 11/25. In this bottle the bourbon was much more subdued and more maple flavor was present much more similar to what I remember from having it on tap on release day. Incredibly smooth and one of the best beers I've ever had. I'm not sure if the first bottle was slightly off or if it really did just congeal and become awesome in just under a month. Went from a very good beer to a f'ing spectacular one.
[Edit #2] Tons of bottle variation in this. Score is more or less an average, but the bottles I've got to try have ranged from around a 3.5 to a 5. 1,298 charactersjmarsh123, Oct 31, 2011
4.88/5  rDev +5.4%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 522oz bottle poured into matching Founders snifter.
Appearance: Looks like dark roast black coffee, with a corresponding frothy mocha head of 1.5 fingers. Head has nice staying power, largely thanks to glass's nucleation point. Lacing leaves a pretty brown on the sounds of the glass. About perfect.
Smell: Bourbon, chocolate, and coffee. No noticeable maple on the nose, but it otherwise smells fantastic.
Taste: So much going on here… bourbon, coffee, roasted malts, chocolate. The maple mostly makes its presence known on the backend, and it leaves a wonderful taste in the mouth that makes you yearn for the next sip. Every sip gives you something a little different.
Mouthfeel: Full bodied, good carb, very silky and smooth in the mouth. The alcohol blends beautifully and provides no burn.
Drinkabilty: Really high. As soon as you finish one sip, you want another. 
Overall: The rare beer that truly lives up to the hype. It's nearly perfect - the lack of maple in the nose is the only thing holding me back from perfect 5's across the board. All of that said, it's only a baby step ahead of KBS. Given the difficulty of acquisition, I'm happy to have tried a bottle but I will be sticking with regular KBS in the future unless more CBS falls into my lap. 1,268 characterscbeer88, Oct 30, 2011

Pours black with brown edges, no head, small bubbles are the only evidence of carbonation. Smells like coffee and burnt sugar, syrup, light bourbon. Taste is great, much better than I remember it being on draft. Sweet, balanced coffee bitterness, thick sugary syrup flavor, a hint of bourbon and oak, bitter chocolate, finishes sweet. Body is a bit lighter then I would like but still thick, light carbonation. A very good beer overall. 483 charactersnkersten, Oct 30, 2011

gotto also thank sweatervest for surprising me with a CBS trade aswell, thank you Kyle, I'll be able to share this with friends twice!
Crap what can I say this IS the CBS
10.6% Imperial stout with coffee aged in maple bourbon barrels. Had side by side with fbs(thanks again kev) and kbs 10(courtesy of birtchstick). 750ml poured out in 4 snifters.
A- looks quite alot like kbs but with a bigger head, half inch dark mocha head. Pours thinner than than kbs.
S- quite alot different than kbs. It took me a while to find this aroma with kbs open next to it, but when u find it wow it's there. Lots of chocolate, alot more than I was expecting. The bourbon is surprisingly present as well. Maple all over this guy in the back and front. I almost scored this one low because I could barely smell it but when u find it I'll be in for a treat. Kbs on the other hand was blanketing the air with it's huge aroma.
T- this is where this one shines. Don't drink this guy chilled, this one is a rom temp drinker for sure. I was giving kbs better marks untill this one heated up. Chocolate, roasted malts, bourbon and maple come through on this guy. The maple is the hardest to find untill it's heated up.
M- medium to thick on the palate, well carbonated.
O- I was expecting more of this guy going in but fuck is this guy amazing as you drink it. I liked the kbs more at first but this one turns into something amazing. If a 2 year old kbs taste this good can u imagine what this CBS taste like with age? 
Consensus was CBS the winner except for me at the beginning, but wow I turned a believer quick as it warmed up, and felt a sadness creep in as the bottles last drops seeped out. Kbs still has the nose of champs tho, and I have a new appreciation for that beer.
Thanks again Kevin for the chance and Kyle for the chance of sharing this guy with some age! 1,908 charactersKevSal, Oct 30, 2011

S: Roasted malts up front followed by sweet, creamy chocolate aromas. Sweet maple syrup notes follow with robust coffee. Vanilla and bourbon aromas peek throughout the nose. Smells like a delicious breakfast.
T: Similar to the aroma, roasted malts hit at first with some creamy chocolate flavors. Sweet maple syrup and bold, robust coffee flavors battle it out on the palate, some sips tasting more like maple, vanilla, and bourbon and other sips tasting more like robust coffee. The finish is both sweet from the maple and slightly bitter from the coffee with only a light burn from the bourbon.
M: Thick body with lowish carbonation, this beer is silky smooth without being extremely thick.
O: A fantastic beer with many flavors and layers that somehow work and blend perfectly. One sip it's chocolatey, the next it's coffee-forward, the next the bourbon and maple shine through. Absolutely delicious. 1,009 charactersn2185, Oct 30, 2011

(A)- Pours a lovely pitch black color. A nice frothy tan head and surprising lace despite the ABV.
(S)- Decadent chocolate with smooth raisin bourbon and subtle maple syrup. Tiny hints at cinnamon and vanilla. Just as awesome as i remember and then some!
(T)- Just how I remember it, and man is it glorious! Velvet-like chocolate, maple, molasses, and a sweet malted milk ball-like shake profile. Its just so smooth, delectable, and delicious, while still having a strong barrel-aged stout characters.
(M)- A perfect; smooth carbonation level. And a perfect balance. Despite a 10.6%ABV level, this is smooth as silk and delectable. Drinks more like a 7 or 8% beer.
(D)- I absolutely loved this on tap all those times I had the pleasure of trying it, but having it this fresh out of the bottle just further reminded and confirmed to me, this is simply one of the best stouts on planet earth. Sweet, malty, and a velvet-like creamy smoothness. Simply put, no other stout tastes like this one does. 1,085 characterssweemzander, Oct 29, 2011

Bottle to CBS Snifter
750 ML
2011
Thanks to Kzoobrew for this one!
Shared with BA GuruDel
App- A good tri-colored mix of red/brown/blacks with a khaki one fingered head. Huge stick on the 2nd half of the pour.
Smell- This had so much going on but worked so well together. It was a bit like a fresh tobacco leaf with a bit of new show leather. As it warmed the bourbon wofted up wit the maple, then vanilla, chocoltae and coffee. Could anything else be missing?
Taste- Much like the nose this had so much going on but just a touch better. It opened with the origial notes of tobacco and leather. The bourbon and maple were next in harmony and was just super rich and creamy. One of the best beers I have ever head along the lines of BT, Citra, Vanilla and KBS.
Mouth- A rich creamy low-medium body with a low-medium carbonation. A good bit of bubbles where it needed to be with a lot of dark chocolate and bourbon maple residual flavors.
Drink- Again going back to back with Topper I was a bit spoiled by Kzoobrew. I cant thank him enough for these two beers but my return box will surely try. I might need to trade for another bottle of this because even worth the premium people have on this bottle it will be well worth it. 1,250 charactersFosterJM, Oct 29, 2011

The aroma is amazing, fresh ground coffee, black strap molasses and malted milk with a very mild oakiness. I rarely find a beer that lives up to it's massive hype but CBS does. The flavors are simple and delicious, rich cocoa and maple syrup with dark roasty coffee and mild woodiness from the barrel, the bourbon is in the background and fits perfectly. Full bodied and velvety smooth with a smooth, fine carbonation. World class beer from a truly great brewery. 584 charactersbiggred1, Oct 29, 2011

A: Dark, as expected. 1 finger mocha colored head which slowly recedes to a few patches
S: At first, I mostly get dark chocolate and roast, with the maple absent. However, as it warmed, maple syrup fills my glass to accompany chocolate and coffee. Barrel aging is subtle, but there is some bourbon detected
T: Big dark chocolate presence up front, with a fair amount of bitterness from the coffee. Maple in the finish and aftertaste, kinda like I just ate something covered in maple syrup
M: Full bodied. Super creamy, smooth with just the slightest tingle from carbonation. Coffee bitterness aftertaste
D: This hits on all marks. Love how all the flavors come together and create a remarkable beer. Worthy of it's praise (trade value is another story though) 871 charactersBrez07, Oct 28, 2011

Looks pretty good. Smaller head and very black. Looks like a big stout. Similar to KBS. 
Smells like coffee, chocolate and bourbon. Very balanced and integrated. Very inviting. 
Tastes excellent. Much like it smells and pretty similar again than KBS with more sweetness and a little more subtle in certain flavours. More coffee than expected though. Really really good. The bourbon compliments the whole thing so well. 
Mouthfeel was a small letdown. Carbonation was good and went down very smooth. However the body was a little thinner than expected and I felt it should have been fuller in general. Small nitpick though. 
Overall very enjoyable and very satisfying. Extremely happy we got so many and were able to share with everyone we could. Definitely worth the time and effort. 872 charactersbootlegger1929, Oct 28, 2011

*From notes
- Bottle shared with siege06nd as a fine end to a long day of CBS hunting -
A: A good pour yields a whopping 1.5 finger head. The retention is top notch, as is the lacing - gobs of the stuff rimming the glass. Rich blackish-brown hue.
S: Freshly roasted & uncut coffee beans, toasted vanilla, hints of warm coconut and sappy wood.
T: This is a really, really, really delicious beer. Mellow charred malt, with some vanilla and bourbon on the mid. The finish is unmistakable: rich maple syrup, and lots of it. The longer is sits and coats the mouth, the sweeter it gets. Unreal.
M: In a word, perfect. It's absolutely luxurious and silky beyond compare. Viscous - thick as freshly laid tar, and jam packed with texture. Liquid velvet to the palate, it's just remarkable.
O: Who the hell knows if Founders CBS lives up to the massive, epic hype it's received. And who cares? What I can tell you is that it's simply a great beer - one of the best and most memorable in recent memory. Every facet here is on point, created with love and care by some of the best brewers in the country, if not the world. This is a monumental achievement that all beer lovers need to applaud.
Seek it out and find out for yourself. 1,273 charactersRhettroactive, Oct 27, 2011

Black pour with a nice brown head. Retention is lacking a bit. The smell is so balanced. Bourbon, sweetness from the maple, roasty and chocolate. The taste follows the smell perfectly. It's just so damn balanced. Bourbon, maple, chocolate, coffee, roastiness. The taste is deep, balanced, delicious. Very heavy body, carbonated well, warming alcohol and dry finish. I love this beer.

4.05/5  rDev -12.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Part of my stout tasting on October 22nd, 2011. 2-3 oz. into snifter. A friend brought this bottle and I continue to thank him for doing so. We went with the full Founders 2011 stout horizontal and tasted Breakfast Stout and KBS minutes before popping the cap on CBS. 
A - Copied over from KBS review. As expected, really. Very dark, close-to-pitch-black coloring. Virtually no head nor retention and very little lacing on the sides. Swirling leaves a light brown coating on the glass.
S - Slight bourbon barrel, but the maple is clearly the dominant aspect of the nose. Slight cocoa, bold coffee bean, and roast underneath. Mellow sweetness overall. 
T - Immediate maple bourbon, vanilla, and brown sugar sweetness. Middle is roasted almonds and coffee. Oak and bitter finish is cut short by the maple and molasses quality. 
M - Medium-heavy body, very nice carbonation, somewhat smooth.
D - It's not quite there. KBS has better balance and complexity across its flavor spectrum. I think the sweetness needs to be cut a tad and underlying characters need to be enhanced. Ideally age will do this. Still worth a try, but seriously not worth the effort required to get it right at bottle release. 1,200 charactersAuracom, Oct 27, 2011

Appearance: Pours an opaque black into a tulip glass with a one finger off white crown that offers little retention or lacing.
Smell: A nice array of roasted malt, coffee, vanilla, bourbon, and a faint dash of maple syrup! I'd give it a 4.3 if I could so I'm rounding up a bit.
Taste: While my sample didn't have much maple sweetness, I could tell that the maple helped cancel out any heat. I'd give it a 4.3 if I could so I'm rounding up a bit.
Mouthfeel: Medium carbonation and medium body.
Drinkability: Surprisingly high considering the abv and style.
I've had this beer on tap twice in the past and I'd say this bottle was my least favorite of the three samplings but still wonderful none the less. The flavors were tame by comparison to the last two samplings. The first draft sampling was more roasty than this one and very restrained in maple syrup profile like this bottle. The second draft sampling had a similar roast profile but a much more vibrant maple syrup profile than this bottle. 1,075 characterskoopa, Oct 27, 2011

Thick dark pour with thin tan head. Aromas of maple, bourbon and milk chocolate abound. The taste follows suite, adding a bit of cold coffee to the mix. And then a charcoal, burnt woodiness that I find very off putting, and was arguably not in the first bottle I had. This astringent like flavor kinda ruins this for me. Beer has great mouthfeel, coating the palate with creaminess and a little heat from the booze. 504 charactersbaconsausage, Oct 26, 2011

A= Pours a pitch black color with a decent looking finger of head on it that is luscious and thick with nice retention and lacing on the glass. The head is a nice looking deep brown color. A nice looking RIS.
S= The smell is heavy on the chocolate. More chocolate than the maple I would say. The maple does play a roll however as well as some black coffee. There is a little vanilla in there from the barrel I think but not much. The barrel comes through a bit as well but keeps a little more quiet. One of the most complex beers I've ever smelled. Each element stands out while still making a complete odor. Well balanced between the odors.
T= The taste is again a balance of all of the flavors mentioned above. Deep dark coffee comes through the most I would say. I hear a lot about the maple and I think the maple might play a back roll. The roll is still there but not as prevalent as people make it sound. The dark chocolate is still present but hides a bit behind the coffee. The alcohol is there a little and there is a decent bourbon flavor. A nice balance.
M= Smooth and tasty. Good flavor and lasts just long enough. 
O= Is this an amazing beer? Yes it is. Is it mind blowing and tasty. Yes it is. It is still another amazing imperial stout among a sea of them however. I dunno if they hype lives up to the beer but the beer is amazing. I think this one was just a little too crazy for me. The beer itself should not be deducted for what people have made of it however and it is one hell of a beer. 1,650 charactersjjanega08, Oct 25, 2011
4.5/5  rDev -2.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Lucky to obtain a bottle of this one! Poured into a Duvel tulip. Deep, black, motor oil body; thick. Two-finger head that is a little darker than mocha. The head dissipates fairly quickly, but leaves a little lacing.
Rich aroma. The maple is definitely present and is the primary difference from KBS. But, the sweet chocolate aroma dominates, with hints of bourbon and coffee.
The flavor is also very rich, sweet but blended extremely well with the many tastes that are present: chocolate, bourbon, maple, coffee, roasted malt. I also get a light hint of hops on the back side as it warms.
Thick mouthfeel, but surprisingly drinkable with all the flavor and the abv. I get very little alcohol. Another superb stout from the kingdom of excellent stouts - Founders. 766 charactersFanofHefe, Oct 25, 2011
4.45/5  rDev -3.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5I was lucky enough to win a chance to buy this rare brew from Capone's...1/12 bottles.
Poured very dark, nearly black. Small head that retained well as I drank, swirled and savored this amazing stout. Smell reminded me of KBS but quite a bit more obvious sweetness and actually less of an alcohol sting in the nose. Definitely got a lovely rich chocolate aroma with notes of coffee, vanilla and bourbon. Nice and roasty...the maple syrup really came through in the taste. 
This is a very complex beer that should be enjoyed slowly as it comes up in temperature. Starts off with a rich chocolate/vanilla taste as undertones of bourbon and maple syrup come through and finish more pronounced. Coffee flavor is present throughout. This brew becomes more balanced in taste as it warms. It is thick, but not in a bad way. Overall, I very much enjoyed this beer and I hope to have another chance at trying it again soon...hopefully on tap. 935 charactersMsRif, Oct 24, 2011
5/5  rDev +8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A: Pitch black with a very dark chocolate brown head. So dark that you can almost imagine it staining the glass. Even just at thin film residue leftover is noticeably dark. Head retention is relatively good too.
S: Stunning. Smells absolutely amazing. Very strong. Lots of chocolate, coffee, roasted malt, bourbon, maple, vanilla and oak. Even a little alcohol sting in the nose but not too badly.
T: Holds up to the smell and then some. As mentioned, good chocolate/coffee/roasted malt bitterness. Bourbon and oaky vanilla are a bit more prominent when it's cold. Maple apparent especially in the aftertaste. As it warms the bourbon and oak relaxes a little bit and it smooths out to become even more incredible. 
M: Super smooth and silky unlike any beer I've had. Thick but not unpleasantly so. Not far from guzzling hershey's syrup.
O: Amazing stout. My previous all-time favorite was KBS and this somehow topped it. I'd rate this all 6s if I could, nothing outside of KBS even comes close. Absolutely decadent and delicious on all levels. A must try for any beer lover. 1,078 charactersDope, Oct 24, 2011
4.8/5  rDev +3.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5750ml bottle, 2011 release. Served at cellar temperature. I’m giddy with anticipation to crack this sucker open!
Pours black with a nice two-finer brown head that leaves sheets and rings of lacing and recedes to a small foamy cap.
Aroma is rich premium coffee, espresso and straight up beans...it could end right there and I’d be satisfied but the onslaught of magnificence continues with really strong bourbon notes and their complimentary vanilla and oak, some decadent chocolate and dark roasted malts, a bit of the maple and alcohol heat come through as well. Very complex aroma and of very good strength. Founders should make some CBS cologne so I can smell this all day every day...
Okay, so we’ve got an amazing aroma...can the flavor stand up? Shit. The flavor not only stands up to the aroma but might even take it up another notch! Starts with some serious milk and dark chocolate, ridiculous coffee and espresso, some vanilla, then the bourbon really comes in along with the maple syrup on the finish. Rather sweet, but not cloying. There is some alcohol heat as well. More a liquid dessert than a breakfast beer...
Mouthfeel is full bodied, somewhat sticky but still creamy, smooth and almost velvety save for some prickly carbonation on the back-end. Let it warm and it just coats the mouth, tongue and soul...
Oh my goodness. I’ve never experienced this level of anticipation with a beer before...I was even shaking a bit when I was getting out the bottle, glass and opener (yeah I’m a geek). Thankfully it lives up to the hype. Another magnificent barrel-aged creation from those geniuses at Founders. Damn. Can they do no wrong? Seriously! This is a masterpiece! Kudos Founders! 1,709 characterselgiacomo, Oct 24, 2011
4.7/5  rDev +1.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours black with a nice cocoa head. Looks great. The smell is big coffee and chocolate with a slight maple sweetness. Smells fantastic. The taste is insane. Huge dark coffee tamed by a nice underlying maple sweetness. Those flavors mend amazingly with the mild bourbon. An occasional boozy flavor pops up, but then is quickly quashed by the maple coffee flavor. This is undoubtedly one of the best tasting beers I have ever had. Intense, but reasonable. The mouthfeel is big and velvety with a nice light carbonation. Overall, this is easily one of the best 10 beers I have ever had. Impressively drinkable and flavorful. Not sure how this beer will work when the coffee fades, or maybe the maple. To me, this is a drink now brew. Enjoy! 737 charactersseeswo, Oct 24, 2011
4.7/5  rDev +1.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Picked up at Deciccos - Ardsley poured into a tulip glass.
A) Murky brown with a nice tan head. Medium lacing.
S) Chocolate and some light coffee notes.
T) Wow, get the maple up front followed up by the coffee and chocolate. The bourbon finishes this one.
M) Silky smooth.
This beer is outstanding. I know I am not breaking any new ground there. What suprises me is the drinkability. While you do get the bourbon notes at the end, it is not overwhelming but complimentary. Hopefully this becomes more widely available in the future. 537 charactersjimmy82063, Oct 23, 2011
4.58/5  rDev -1.1%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.52011 vintage thanks elijah
appearance - oil pour of blackness into snifter. great head, this is fresh, so thats what you get, a beautiful looking imp stout.
smell - chocolate, bourbon, coffee beans, vanilla, dark malts, maple syrup, minor hops... so close to being a 5
taste - much the same, coffee and hops doing a bit too much bitterness to my liking. still a 4.5 easy. maple, chocolate and malts are amazingly well blended.
mouthfeel - amazing body, so thick. and for that the carbonation is amazing. oily sticking in the mouth. 535 charactersclaytong, Oct 23, 2011
4.82/5  rDev +4.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Was fortunate enough to get on a local bottle shop's waiting list for this one. Decided to crack it open sooner rather than later in order to catch some maple flavor.
Poured from 750ml bottle into Bordeaux glass.
Aroma: Fantastic, complex aroma! A line-up of some of my favorite qualities in an imperial stout: milk chocolate syrup, fudge brownie, bourbon, espresso, vanilla bean, and even cabernet sauvignon. All of these notes ramp up as the beer warms.
Appearance: Pitch black body with a 1/2 finger dark tan, creamy head. The foam disappears fairly quickly, but fine bubbles reappear as the beer washes onto the inside of the glass with each sip/swirl.
Flavor: Similar to the aroma, the flavor really came through over time. Overall impressions were initially, a considerable sweetness for the style. Alcohol comes through a bit strong, especially initially in this relatively-young stout. Coffee and hops are there to provide some strong bitterness. All of the characteristics noted in the aroma also came across in the flavor, plus some maple syrup! One of the tastiest imperial stouts I've had.
Mouthfeel: Medium-low carbonation, medium-thick viscosity, and some peppery heat in the mouth.
Overall: Was it a great beer? Yes! Did it live up to all the hype? Well, it probably would have been impossible for a beer to live up to all the hype/buzz that's surrounded this one. Is a bottle worth $100? I don't think so. $75? Probably not. At the same time, I don't want to be one of those "meh" guys who doesn't give a great beer like this its due credit. If you can get your hands on it in a reasonable trade, or by paying $40 or less, though, I highly recommend it!!! 1,676 charactersmdvatab, Oct 23, 2011
4.08/5  rDev -11.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4First had: bottle from Capone's, Norristown, PA
2011 raffle with 12 available bottles, and the lovely MsRif was fortunate enough to win one! Thanks to Matt Capone and his bustling staff for providing these gems...I actually feel bad that he wasn't able to keep one for himself, but his respect for his patrons is honorable to say the least.
I took this bottle home to enjoy in comfort with my wife. I do have a Founders snifter, but for some reason I decided to decant this hyped brew into a Trappist Rochefort chalice. Abysmal obsidian color, capped with a milk chocolaty head that recedes quite a bit but doesn't completely dissipate. Lots of attractive lacing. When cooled, the aroma and taste is more on the boozy side with hints of anise, so I let it warm up quite a bit before the majority of the tasting. Scents of chocolate, distant coffee, with notes of bourbon and touches of sweetness. Pretty similar to the KBS, really, in aroma and taste, with most differences being subtle. Taste of rich, rich chocolate that really comes to the foreground when the beer is warmer, along with definite heavy but smooth coffee notes. Booze is an afterthought, but definitely present from mid-palate onward, and the maple comes out to play at about the same time, giving a quite mellow finish, infused with alcohol warmth. I actually think this tastes a bit more boozy than the KBS, even though the latter is slightly higher in ABV. Just about full-bodied, rich and smooth, and highly drinkable, but obviously to be savored slowly.
Was it worth the hype? Meh. I rank it very highly among the beers I've had, but I wouldn't say it's worth traveling the world for, and definitely not worth paying a gouging price for. If you can find it for $25, grab it. MAYBE $35 at the most, but any higher than that, and you're better off just being patient and waiting for your time to come.
Just for an idea of the stupid hype around this beer. Someone next to me at a bar once said that "CBS makes KBS seem like it's watered down." Anyone who says anything like this...don't listen to anything else they have to say about beer or anything in general, because they're full of it.
Plus, KBS is better. 2,187 charactersRifugium, Oct 23, 2011

Appearance: Pours almost black with a hint of red coming through at the edges. There is a layer of beautiful tan head and decent retention.
Smell: Sweet bourbon and maple syrup with strong notes of coffee. Quite sweet and a bit nutty.
Taste: Just as wonderful as the smell. Smooth coffee and bourbon. The maple notes are perfect. Bourbon heat is really good. 
Mouthfeel: Thick, but not too thick. Tingly and smooth carbonation with a dry finish.

5/5  rDev +8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5On tap at Mike’s Bar and Grill during Cleveland Beer Week. Huge thanks to Founders for bringing some kegs of this this week. Just awesome. I have been searching for the perfect beer for years. I found it last night. The guy next to me said he had this last week in a bottle and tonight was his first time on tap. He said it was clearly better on tap. I have only had this once. On tap. Last night. So this review is based on what I enjoyed last evening. Pours pitch black with a slight tan ring around the edges. Looks like what I would expect. I put the glass up to my nose and whiff. Whoa. Layers of aromas. First I noticed a stickly sweet maple, then a touch of coffee, roast, and wood made a noticeable note here as well. I smelled this a few times because I was surprised by the complexity just in the aroma. I took a sip. My first thought was "Holy Fuck". An explosion of flavor hit me. Upfront their was a strong sense of coffee, followed very closely by a touch of maple sweetness, then a touch of dark roast from the grain bill and a slight note of vanilla with some booze notes that was not at all hot. The booze flavors were hid well by the way this was barrel aged and melded perfectly in the finished product. There really was no booze as there was just a note of it and it made for a perfectly rounded beer. The finish combined all of the above ever so slightly. There was no cloying sweetness. Nothing over the top. Everything in this beer was perfectly represented from start to finish. I honestly never thought I would give a perfect score to any beer. Until now. This one for me goes beyond the hype and was worth every sip. 1,644 charactersfiver29, Oct 22, 2011

A: Black with a foamy caramel colored head. Head is thin even layer across the top. Dissipates quickly. 
S: Milk chocolate, sweet coffee are most present. Strong rubbing alcohol at first. Overall, smells like walking into a good coffee shop. Fresh beans and toasty pastries.
T: Wowza! Complex, strong, thick, sweet. Like good quality drinking chocolate. Aftertaste is the best part - not bitter at all like a lot of beers of this style. The maple syrup really comes through on the finish. Mild oak flavor. Vanilla bean. Has some similar alcohol notes as a good dark rum.
M: Amazing. This is the best part of the beer I think. Smooth, filling, sticky, and thick. Light carbonation that is only notPerfection. 
O: Just a good, solid, delicious beer. The only breakfast stout that really tastes like breakfast. 902 charactersnickhiller, Oct 22, 2011

4.85/5  rDev +4.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5First of all, very happy I snagged one of these elusive bottles.
Serving glass: Poured from bottle into Snifter.
Appearance: Pure black (obviously) with decent brown head and some intricate lacing.
Smell: Roasted malt aroma of chocolate, molasses and coffee. There is a sharp note from the barrels, with oak, bourbon, and I guess that odd sweetness is maple.
Taste: And there it is. Wow. The barrels really take center stage with maple, oak, vanilla, bourbon and coconut. There is definitely a highly roasted Imperial Stout underneath with nice notes of chocolate and coffee, but the barrel-aging is what sent my taste buds into the stratosphere.
Feel: Ridiculously smooth and creamy. Obviously full-bodied, with low carbonation and a highly warming finish. Feel it burn!
Overall: This is quite simply barrel-aging at its finest. Not sure if this or The Abyss is my favorite Imperial Stout - Abyss is more about the Stout backbone, while CBS is all about the barrels. A side-by-side would be fun, but very unlikely to ever happen. 1,036 charactersbsp77, Oct 21, 2011
4.32/5  rDev -6.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Thanks to Tom for sharing this with "The Core"
A: Motor oil black with very small amount of creamy tan head. Heavy alcohol feet when swirled.
S: Sharp espresso notes and chocolate dominate at first. Espresso more so than the chocolate. The boozeyness from the bourbon comes in and it smells pretty hot. Not much maple, very very faint. Some vanilla notes as well.
T: Bitter coffee and chocolate up front. Some bourboney goodness and a hint of maple in the finish. As it warms there is more of a maple and vanilla presence. Very decadent and sweet. 
M: The mouthfeel is THICK and creamy. It coats the mouth and is almost chewy. The sweetness ads somewhat of a cloying quality to the mouthfeel. A bit hot as there is defiantly some alcohol burn on the back of my throat in the finish, not bad but noticeable. 
O: This was a very good beer. However, I feel regular KBS may be a bit more enjoyable for me. I think it might have benefited from a year in the cellar as the heat was a tad more than I like, and I do enjoy a hot beer. The hype train on this beer is a bit unjustified, it is very good but not worth the presidential ransoms some people are asking for it. 1,167 charactersPdiddey3d, Oct 21, 2011
5/5  rDev +8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5went to the founders happy hour at slows bbq, had this on tap into a goblet, low light room so appearance might not be perfect, also i got 2 pours of it since my buddies girlfriend didnt like it, also this was a whale of mine and i had a godly expectation and it did not let me down, 2011 vintage
appearance - black, void of all light but around the head it appeared to be slightly red, this could have been due to the lighting, a darkish light brown head about a finger tall, that left but left nice lacing, low carbonation
smell - up front was a very sweet coffee smell (i think it is a beautiful blend of the maple syrup, the bourbon, and the coffee) almost fruity, next came the bourbon and coffee that is reminiscent of KBS and chocolate, once it warmed up there was a noticeable alcohol smell but one that seemed appropriate and almost helped to balance out the sweetness
taste - coffee, but not as bitter as breakfast stout or KBS up front, fading into a sweet blend of maple syrup, chocolate, bourbon, vanilla and coffee, and finishes with a sweet maple bourbon coffee flavor, similar to a sugar cube and a drop of syrup into an irish coffee, simply amazing, as it warmed up a bit of booze came through
mouthfeel - thick, sticky, and lingered on the tongue, amazing, fit the nose and taste perfectly
overall - if there is a god this is evidence of it, simply amazing, lived up to the hype and my own expectations, and more, a perfect 5, hit all the notes i wanted sweet, bitter, booze, and coffee
other note - decided to sit on my bottle for at least a year, i was spoiled with 12oz (more like 18 from the pours) will report back once it is opened, once again probably my favorite beer to this point 1,713 charactersSeaUrchin, Oct 21, 2011

4.89/5  rDev +5.6%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5What can I say. Despite the hype, I was blown away by this beer. Wasn't sure what to expect, maybe a bigger, full-throttle, Mikkeller-esque version of the "regular" Breakfast Stout? Not the case. This beer is simply delicious. It's also easier to drink and sweeter than its sibling.
The color is dark chocolate with a sliver of cinnamon tinged head without retention. It's impenetrably dark and is definitely similar to the 'regular' in color. Perhaps blacker?
Blow you away nose. . . I'm talking a grin from ear to ear. Whiffs of whiskey barrel and maple syrup lead the way followed by high-toned coffee aromas. Tertiary aromas of smoke, bitter chocolate, sweet molasses, cinnamon, nutmeg, black tea, and oak give this some serious complexity. It presents itself in an almost floral abundance of sweetness. Imagine combining grade B maple syrup with a serious Bourbon in the 'regular' Breakfast Stout and you can imagine what this smells like.
The aromas translate well on the palate where the bourbon, maple syrup, and coffee prevail. No booziness to speak of and without bitterness. It's sweet yet savory, smooth and clean. On the palate you can find those intriguing chocolate and spice notes from the aromas. The mouthfeel is sweet, long, plush, and deep with very slight carbonation and no rough edges. It finishes with a bit of tannin, I assume from the wood it was aged in.
Overall an amazing beer, one that's a candidate for perfection. 1,449 charactersComposerZero, Oct 20, 2011

A - Poured into my Duvel tulip a super oily black with a huge, creamy mocha two finger head that fades to leave a thick cloud and halo.
S - Strong coffee, chocolate, and bourbon. There is a super light maple aftertaste. Its so incredibly smooth and rich.
T - More of the nose with super strong coffee and chocolate and bourbon. The maple is there on the finish but its not nearly as strong as I remember the draft style being.
M - So silky smooth and creamy, yet some nice fresh carbonation. the ABV is so well hidden, it drinks like a 5-6%!
O - Overall this is an amazing beer that is so masterfully ochestrated. It needs more maple syrup though. Alot more. This is still a great stout, just, not up to par with the on tap verson. 811 charactersrudzud, Oct 20, 2011
4.42/5  rDev -4.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5The time has finally come: C. B. S.! Thankfully, I was able to snag a bottle from Village Bottle Shoppe #2’s lottery – I was one of the four (out of THIRTY) who won the chance to buy it! Honestly, I’m still just astonished I was able to get one. So thank you very much Dave and everyone else from VBS for making this epic tasting happen – you guys ROCK!
A: Shining black, syrupy, and bold: one killer look. The head forms slowly and deliberately, coming to a full finger of dense, layered foam. Looks great at first glance, and the addition of moderate retention and abundant bubbly lacing makes it that much better. A final interesting note is the color of the foam: dark, dark brown, so rich that it shines like lacquered wood. It certainly catches the eye. Pay attention, stout-makers: THIS is presence.
S: Damn – that’s awesome. Spicy bourbon and rich dark chocolate are so big you can just about taste them: powerful, yet smooth. Then, in comes a jab of coffee, roasty and bitter, that saddles up with the peppery spice of cinnamon for an added kick of hotness. Now, throughout the whole thing, there’s a sticky sweetness of real maple syrup (awesome), but the true colors only come out on the back end. Mixing with brown sugar, nutmeg, and oak from the barrels, the real Canadian sweetness lays thick as this one’s final aroma. Just fantastic. Even after just a few whiffs, I’m ready to dive right into this one – it’s just that good.
T: I didn’t think I’d ever find another palate like Dogfish Head’s World Wide Stout, a beer that I absolutely loved: that decadent alcoholic tinge, with just enough complexity in the sweetness to keep it from getting too cloying. But now, after just a small sip, I’m happy to say that this has proven me wrong. The first hit is a huge bourbon smash, fiery yet smooth, that overpowers the senses with wood, tobacco, vanilla, pepper, and smoke. It’s excellent. Soon, though, it becomes apparent that the main focus of this beer is a syrupy, darkened sweetness. Though I was expecting it, I don't think I was totally prepared for such a bold statement: earthy-sweet malt grains, chocolate fondue, cinnamon-sugar, molasses, and even some fruity strawberry/banana-sweetness are all carried along by a an extreme maple richness that seems to last a lifetime. It's very good, but, like Goose Island BCBS, the sweetness can hit the palate a bit too strongly at times, making it less and less drinkable. The aftertaste is nice, though: a milk chocolate meltdown, with big maple booze rounding it out. Overall, this palate is smooth, unique, and complex (there’s even a small but mighty hop taste in there, popping up with some pine bits on occasion), but a little too sugary to be an absolute favorite.
M: This is where so many stout “kings” lose me, usually because of thinness. Not this time, though: the body, perfectly smooth, slides around with a substantial viscous feel. The carbonation, smooth as silk, has just enough pop to keep it drinkably playful. Still, it warms the ears, dries the tongue, and opens the nose – a bourbon fire, for sure.
O: No doubt about it, this beer is superb; the maple tastes just add to the richness and complexity. I’m glad that I finally got to try it, so again, many thanks to Village Bottle Shoppe. There’s something special about a beer that’s this hyped, and luckily, it has the intensity to back it up. In all, it was one hell of an experience. You keep releasing beers like this, Founders, and Grand Rapids will no doubt become my second home. 3,571 charactersBarryMFBurton, Oct 19, 2011
4.48/5  rDev -3.2%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Served out of a bottle, poured into a 16 oz. mug.
(A) Thick, leggy, oily pour. Dark, dark brown, almost black, with a huge bubbly, dark chocolate milk head. Dissipated slowly, almost "cascading" in the glass. 2-3 finger head, not much lacing, the darkest of the dark. Beautiful.
(S) Strong, bitter, dark espresso/roasty chocolate malt kick followed by faint, clean 90 proof bourbon notes. Nothing too strong, finishing with a residual sugary sweetness on the nose.
(T) Big, strong espresso, followed by bittersweet chocolate, French toast, creamy cinnamon, slight toffee, finishing with a slight bourbon burn, then a huge maple syrup linger- like pancakes on Sunday morning. Amazing.
(M) Dense, smooth, creamy. Coats the tongue and roof of the mouth with heavy, very mild acidic sugar. 
(O) Great beer. Enjoyed it considerably more than KBS. I am a big bourbon fan as well, and this is a clinical take on what a bourbon aged beer should be. Very balanced, very justified in it's standing. Founders setting the bar very high. Should I be fortunate enough to get another bottle, I would not pass this up.

A - pours a jet black as expected with a finger or so of coffee/mocha head. Lacing sticks around and tons of alcohol legs. 
S - wow. Immediately smells like fresh FBS with the bourbon component. Definitely get some sweet notes from what I assume is the maple. Enticing. 
T - bitterness up front leadin to huge huge coffee, chocolate, bourbon. So complex. There's a sticky sweetness that remains at the back of the tongue - can't make out maple exactly but it gives that impression. 
M - silky smooth, goes down dangerously easy. Creamy mouthfeel with only a hint of heat at the end that complements the flavor profile so well. 
O - stunning beer. I love how mellow it is while still being complex. To mimic others it's well worth the hype and seems to remind me of a mellowed, sweeter KBS. so good. 852 charactersbballmj2k, Oct 19, 2011
4.25/5  rDev -8.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4This showed up on tap down the street. Much easier than hunting a bottle like a maniac!
App- Dark brown to black. Thin tan cap. Minimal lacing, very fine bubbles if anything.
Smell- Picking up the maple, for sure. The bourbon is a little muted, as the maple dominates to my mind. A little coffee roast as well. The vanilla, coffee and chocolate smells I am used to, so it's the maple that stands out. It may not be the strongest component of the aroma, but it's the most unusual to my mind. 
Taste- There is some coffee burnt at the front, a little roasty to my mind. However, the waves of vanilla mellow it out, and it's all maple to the finish. The sweetness of the maple takes its toll on me, and lingers for quite awhile. The bourbon is pretty mellow, as it should be for a Canadian. The harshness of the roast is nicely balanced. A sweeter beer than anticipated, for sure. I'd prefer a stronger heat. 
Mouthfeel- Good and rich without being thick or syrupy. Nice carbonation. About as good as it gets. 
Overall- Something about the way the maple lingers doesn't do it for me. It's a really good beverage, but that lingering sweet maple is off-putting. I like a little stronger heat, bourbon, vanilla and I was not getting it. I'll take a Bourbon County any day of the week, but that's just me. Glad I got to have it this year, and glad I didn't have to run over an old lady to get some. 1,396 characterscallmescraps, Oct 17, 2011
4.3/5  rDev -7.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Pours a deep black body with a foamy dark brown head. The head decipitates down to a tine lace that sticks too the glass.
Smells of roasted coffee beans and bourbon with hints of sweet maple, dark chocolate and a bit of heat in the finish. 
Taste is mainly the coffee, bourbon and maple all well balanced with hints of dark chocolate and a tiny bit of vanilla at the end. A bit boozy at first but settles as the beer settles.
Mouthfeel is heavy and thick, very velvety yet slightly creamy. Well carbonated and very smooth.
Overall this was worth the 20$ price tag. Although I do prefer the kbs, its still highly recommended 628 charactersStockfan42, Oct 17, 2011
4.52/5  rDev -2.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5A: Pours a beautiful deep black. There is a surprising brown (almost grey) head on this beer that lingers for awhile. Some lacing is left on the glass as it drinks, but nothing major.
S: Smells of mainly of roasted malt and coffee with tons of sweet vanilla in the background.
T: Tastes of coffee, maple, vanilla, milk chocolate, and dark chocolate. This beer is a lot sweeter that I was expecting, but it's still fantastic.
M: Full bodied beer, and I'm absolutely blown away by how creamy it is. There is a cloying nature to this brew. It sticks to the palate and you sometimes want to chew it down. This beer is super sooth, like drinking melted chocolate.
O: I thought this beer pretty damn good. The sweetness is high, but not overpowering. All the flavors are spot on, and they really blend nicely. I'm really glad to have tried it, but I would choose 2 bottles of KBS over a CBS. 889 characterstrxxpaxxs, Oct 17, 2011
4.7/5  rDev +1.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5I had this beer at Al's of Hampden, in Enola, PA on 10-15-11.
A: This beer is black like used motor oil. It has a white/tan head that dissipates very quickly into a thin ring around the edge of the glass. The bubbles are very fine and creamy in appearance.
S: It has very strong coffee notes. The black and chocolate malts are extremely prevalent as well. I'm also getting some leather and licorice in there. Perhaps some toasted wood as well? I can't really pick out a hop profile.
T: Coco, cream and coffee. The malt profile in this beer is astounding. Earth, chocolate, cereal, blankets of coffee, etc. The hops are non-existent. The overall taste is synonymous with the feelings I had as a child when Saturday Morning Cartoons came on. Superb!
M: Velvety and very smooth, for a breakfast stout. It's well balanced and doesn't leave a harsh or sticky after taste on the palate and tongue.
D: This beer is VERY drinkable. It's warming and comforting. Wonderful beer. 973 charactersMicroBeerMan1980, Oct 17, 2011
4.55/5  rDev -1.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5This pours dark black with a mocha colored thick cream that fades slowly and leaves huge rings of lace.
Whiff of faint bourbon and dry cocoa with bitter coffee notes and licorice notes. Subdued earth tones, colar, and oaky, woody tones. 
Sweet chocololate up front fades into coffee and a slight boozy burn in the finish. Chocolate and coffe persist and linger throughout. Nice maple middle sticks in the finish with an after breah of cocoa, vanilla, and woody oak tones. Earthy tones throughout.
Lots of layers, complex and interesting. The most amazing thing is the balance and body. Maple tones the bourbon which placed nicely. No element overpowers another.
Smooth, cream, velvety and tounge coating. Syrupy slickness.
Overall, an amazing beer in balance, flavor, body and aroma. Abolutely delicious. 809 charactersJayS2629, Oct 17, 2011

750ml. bottle at fridge temp poured into a snifter.
pours out a thick opaque black with a creamy dark tan head with some random giant bubbles. spots of lace, and some syrupy looking legs left on the glass.
some big heavily roasted espresso coffee jumps out initially. a bit of heat. a bit sweet and syrupy, not necessarily maple, and some roasted malt. a hint of vanilla.
all the flavors meld with one another very nicely. espresso coffee beans are mostly at the forefront. sweet milk chocolate, creamy. just a hint of maple and maybe some vanilla towards the finish. 
really loved the mouthfeel of this. so smooth and creamy... velvety. minimal carbonation, with a thick heavy body. 
this is an exceptional stout, definatly unique. love the coffee flavors, but maybe lacked a touch on the maple. i hate to say it considering the hype and all, but id prolly take a KBS over this. had this right after my very first kate the great and they were about even for me, even though my scores may say different... 1,056 charactersdogfishandi, Oct 17, 2011
3.76/5  rDev -18.8%look: 4 | smell: 3 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4This beer pours a full bodied midnight black with dark brown highlights and a beige lacing around my glass. It smells like a Breakfast Stout, a lot of bitter coffee with moderate chocolate. I don't get any bourbon notes at all. The flavors featured are very sweet maple syrup, smooth chocolates, and bitter coffee. It's really not that complex and is overly sweet. It's a maple bomb. I wish it was far more subdued. It drinks medium to full in body. It's a nice drinker but its sooo sweet. It's holding it back. As it stands this beer is vastly overrated and inferior when compared to FBS and KBS. Recognize.
Edit: After having both this and Wide Awake It's Morning, I'm sure the two are related. It makes me want to try the Maple Bacon Coffee Porter to see if it's in the middle. 781 charactersaasher, Oct 17, 2011
4.35/5  rDev -6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Pours a thick black color with a huge pillowy light brown head that slowly settles.
The aroma is of rich coffee and milk chocolate. Strong woody scent with hints of the bourbon. There is some molasses and vanilla notes as well. Really love that Founders breakfast stout aroma.
The taste is bold and sweet. Things start off with a strong coffee flavor, fresh grounds. The beer has a pronounced woody flavor which brings some bark like notes with earthy bitterness. The bourbon and vanilla are light but noticable, just like KBS it doesn't overpower. Not sure if I taste maple specifically, but there is a big sweetness that runs throughout. Molasses, brown sugar, syrup, its all there. The sweetness is a bit overpowering.
The body is big and thick and velvty smooth despite the needed prickly carbonation. Very sweet on the palate but it does have that earthy bitterness to combat it. It is a tad boozy and the sweetness does border on cloying.
Very bold with plenty of outstanding flavors. The FBS, KBS, CBS line is just fantastic. I prefer the KBS to the CBS because the CBS is a bit too sweet and kind of overpowers the bourbon. 1,135 charactersGmann, Oct 17, 2011

4.43/5  rDev -4.3%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Black and completely opaque.  Tan head almost non existent.  Very little carbonation streams float to the top.  
 I first get chocolate.  Then the bourbon and very slight coffee.  Maybe even a little smokiness.  The maple is there, but barely detectable for me.  A little disappointed to sense a metallic smell.  It dicipates over time though.
Taste can be described in one word - subtle.  With so much complexity and different tastes-the coffee, chocolate, bourbon, the maple-there is not one that stands out entirely.  Very well balanced.  There is a nice sweetness at the end of the sip.  It's like a whole meal was tasted in one sip.  The only trace of any alcohol is the slight burn down the throat.  You're almost thankful of this to remind you that this is beer.
Like all of founders breakfast stouts the mouthfeel is silky smooth. Even though it is heavy, you're tricked  into thinking that it is lighter because of the complexity of tastes.  Perfectly carbonated.
Without a doubt, an excellent beer.  What was it worth the hype?I'm not so sure.  Anyway, I feel lucky enough to score a bottle , but a little ashamed at how much I paid.  All in all, trying different beer is a perfect metaphor of   life for me-  be in the moment, experience as much of it as you can, but try not to take it too seriously. 1,337 characters33nickadams, Oct 16, 2011
4.55/5  rDev -1.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Has this from bottle and poured into an ommegang glass. Poured an almost motor oil dark black color. It didn't have the consistency on the pour, just the appearance. 
Big, bold, and rich nose that is very layered. Loads of espresso tones along with malts, dark chocolate and some alcohol as well. The heat on the nose is a bit distracting 
About as full bodied as it can get. The feel is well layered but it doesn't feel overbearing at all. Not noticing the alcohol as much on the feel, but it is still there. More espresso based with some maple syrup also noticeable as well
Is it possible to be impressed and let down in a way at the same time? It was still extremely good, but the alcohol showing the way it did was bothersome. This probably needs a little bit of time to fully balance out 795 charactersKDawg, Oct 16, 2011
4.59/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5At Al's of Hampden. Last night and again this afternoon. Served in a mini snifter both times. 11 ounces of glory.
A: The stout is pitch black, an encompassing morass of depth, really a beauty to look at. The bottle pour has left only the faintest band of dark head behind, The viscous body has legs.
S: Sweet maple syrup paired with vanilla bourbon, coffee and roasted chocolate. Each aroma takes it time, gradually emerging as the stout warms. The maple is, by far, the most unique aspect, a rich sweetness cuts through the rest of the already-formidable imperial stout.
T: Imperialistic and coffee-drive, the first couple sips bring the coffee stout to the fore. The coffee buzz iz intoxicatingly good, coaxing the rest of the stout out. The bourbon and maple follow, bringing out the intensity of the stout. The bourbon lends vanilla and coconut before the maple comes through with a syrupy strength. That maple is strong and very dry, each sip left my mouth to deal with a dry sweetness that screamed out for more. The whole package, as strong as it is, just tastes right - a velvety smooth stout.
M: The swirling flavors, bourbon and maple and coffee and chocolate, come together like few other beers can. From the late-night neon din to a mid-day sit-down, CBS doesn't disappoint.
O: A beer like this deserves an addendum, an "I'm with you in Rockland" postscript. Each sip is so complex, so flavorful, that words can barely do it justice. 1,450 charactersakorsak, Oct 16, 2011
4.5/5  rDev -2.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5After hearing how great this is for so long I was stoked to get to try it myself. Had a nice taste last weekend and now I'm sitting down to try a glass in a relaxed setting. Lightly chilled in a Duvel tulip.
Pours with a nice fuzzy tan head and the expected darker than black color one expects from a monster stout. Attractive.
The aroma has enormous coffee with a smooth background of maple and some hints of bourbon, chocolate and vanilla. Very nice to the nose.
The taste carries on where the aroma leaves off with the maple sweetness that the KBS does not. It's pretty amazingly balanced given how big the flavors are. Its got a creaminess that is pretty surprising in a way - not quite what I expected from a beast like this. It works given the sweetness and between the two they take the edge off of the coffee.
The mouthfeel is lives up to my favorite term for all things right in a good stout - lush. It is thick and fills and coats the mouth with just a little alcohol burn around the edges. Very nice.
Overall its really damn good. I'd place it behind KBS and FBS, but not by much. I get why there has been such hype even if I prefer the established greats better. 1,179 charactersnormyk, Oct 16, 2011

A - Pours jet black with a small half finger tall mocha colored head leaving small webs of lace down the glass.
S - Smells of rich espresso, chocolate, vanilla, bourbon, nuts, maple syrup, and the ever present dark roasted grains. Some booze begins to creep in as it warms, only growing stronger as it comes to room temperature.
T - Starts off with a big, roasty, espresso kick quickly giving way to quite a bit of sweetness; mostly maple syrup, chocolate, and vanilla; and some light bourbon heat. Some light smoke creeps in as the sweetness begins to ween but it never really goes away fully. The finish is a mix of dark roast and sugary sweetness, lingering on the pallet for some time.
M - Heavy body and flavor with moderate carbonation. Sweet, slightly boozy, feel. Almost syrup like in the finish with plenty of sweetness.
O - There is no doubt that this is one of the best out there. The sweetness is strong but still manageable and even with the high ABV I could still drink a few of these no problem. I still plan to seek this one out on-tap at some point but this was a great introduction. 1,210 charactersorangesol, Oct 16, 2011

Drinking right next to kbs and regular and the maple is nice and noticeable. Big coffee mild bourbon and some nice sweetness. Flavor has a bit more of the maple with a smooth bourbon flavor with a little bit of heat. Maple, coffee, coco, mild sweetness. Holy crap this one kills it. Mouthfeel is not too syrupy not too thin, good mild carb, perfect. This is why I love founders. Great beer, great experience.

4.83/5  rDev +4.3%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Well, thanks to you (you know who you are), and on a lark I miraculously scored ONE bottle. Coddled and revered with care, poured into a large snifter glass at a good cellar temperature to review. (many comparisons will be made in terms of this vs. on tap).
Appearance is just a flat out knockout mostly because of head formation. A creamy coffee light brown and caramel, small bubbled consistency and forms so nicely. The head has a spectacular character that I have not witnessed before, and pulls the beer over the top in appearance. While holding like a solid stout, in the corner ring collar there is a sheen like film, not gross looking, but like a small soup like skin, that glosses over the edges. The corners of this head with it's hint of legs, and nice leopard lacing, show an edge of just shining polished glass. Just unreal, never seen anything like it. Body color is your standard walnut black/brown, some noticeable carbonation while tilting the glass.
Nose, in comparison on tap, less sweet and way more balanced and enjoyable. Still incredibly roasty and coffee dominant, but a light soft milk sensation and slight sweet cream. Soft notes continue but there is just a faint bit of heat here.
Taste brings a wonderful balance. Coffee dominant but still with a light brown sugar that doesn't overpower. Texture velvety as ever, but palate then gets on the finish miraculously the one thing I have been waiting for in a stout bourbon used barrel. A hint of whiskey. Whiskey angle is not distinct, but there, a slight sense but not so much. Bitterness comes after some warming, mixes with slight boozy spirit whisk(e)y and gives off tobacco just a slight touch. Chocolate, vanilla angles still not quite there, but others I gave it too certainly picked up on chocolate.
Overall, less of a one trick pony out of the bottle, but still coffee dominant and forward but the hint of whisk(e)y just pushes it over the edge, tastes are balanced, varied, highly exploratory, and it's far less sweet which makes it much more tolerable and enjoyable for myself. Just pure magic. I can't say anymore, I drank it all with ease, it was so easy to drink on top of it. 
Nothing more needs to be said than has already been. 2,224 characterssmakawhat, Oct 16, 2011
4.88/5  rDev +5.4%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Thank you Marie @ discount for coming through...never thought I'd land one of these. Served in my D'Achouffe glass tulip...
Pours a viscous black body...large and creamy tan head...retains for quite a while leaving a thick layer of lacing on the top of the glass.
Nose...oh goodness. Coffee, chocolate & maple syrup - makes sense seeing as those are the main ingredients. Some vanilla, oak & bourbon notes popping through but this is a coffee bomb. So happy I'm trying this fresh.
First sip...yes, oh yes. All of the above flavors are so present - coats my entire mouth. Almost like a malted milkshake, it's so thick and savory. Dear lord. No alcohol heat whatsoever. 
Enormous body....BCS level of viscosity. 
Finishes; everywhere. Usually there's a defining point of my palate where I taste the end (tip, mid, back of the tongue). This beer is everywhere, and leaves me with some sweet vanilla. 
Outstanding. Light years ahead of KBS, and worth the hype. *** A+ 969 charactersdrumminbrewer, Oct 16, 2011
4.59/5  rDev -0.9%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Fresh 2011 batch, poured from a 64 oz. growler into a snifter.
Appearance: Unfortunately either the keg was light on the carbonation or it lost a bit in the growler. My pour has a minimal tan head that fades to nothing quickly. The color is a ebony with just a bit of ruby in the edges.
Smell: The aroma is pretty fantastic, I can tell that I am in for a serious bourbon barrel beer. Dark semi-sweet chocolate, molasses, and roasted malt dominate what aroma I assign to the base beer. Bourbon, oak, vanilla, and a nice dash of maple are from the barrel aging process.
Taste: The flavors all make themselves known immediately, with little or no progression. A dark Belgian chocolate flavor blends with sweet molasses and some dark roasted malts. Bourbon, vanilla, and oak all bracket the taste and add further complexity, with the maple simply serving as a way to push the flavor over the edge. Fantastic. There is a soft coffee bitterness at the end that is much more noticeable as it warms.
Mouthfeel: The lack of carbonation accounts for me knocking it down a notch. Other than that, the body is luxuriously thick and creamy. A bourbon bite lurks, but the creaminess is just right. There is a bit of carbonation and a touch of alcohol bite as well. 
Overall: The difference between trying this fresh and trying a batch that is almost a year old is like night and day. The bourbon, molasses, and maple flavors are so much better defined, while the beer is full and viscous enough to make it drinkable. Truly a phenomenal beer. One day I will get to try a full carbonated fresh batch and it will probably be a near perfect score. 1,634 charactersKickInTheChalice, Oct 16, 2011

A: Black as midnight with three finger head that formed a thick frothy lacing, good carbonation.
S: Bourbon , coffee , whiffs of chocolate, roasted malts and barley.
T: Sweet bitter chocolate , hints of bourbon, coffee is prevalent, slight maple syrup hints, slight toffee/vanilla/caramel , roasted barley.
O: Seems alot like KBS with some maple syrup added (Not that that's a bad thing) A little sweet for me, maybe a month or two would do this one some good, The 10.7% abv is extremely well hidden , As this beer warms the flavors seem to meld together very well, The sweetness of the Maple syrup compliments the bourbon , The coffee is ever present and as a coffee lover this is a good thing, Overall a solid American Double /Imperial Stout that was a treat to drink, would definitely have again.
Side note - This paired well with a BLT. 896 charactersInebriatedJoker, Oct 15, 2011

A: Jetblack with a two finger dark tan head.
S: Sweet chocolate, strong coffee, and some vanilla/bourbon scents; I picked up a mild amount of heat in the smell. 
T: Upfront, there was an abundance of chocolate, and coffee flavors running wild. As they began to subdue, sweet vanilla began to bloom. The flavor out the back blew me away; the maple syrup starts to emerge, however, it clashes with the heat from the alcohol, making a really interesting flavor. 
M: a decent amount of carbonation, and a really smooth mouth feel. I was expecting a thick-syrupy feel, but that is not the case.
O: The beer lives up to its hype, and I can now understand why people are going above, and beyond to get their hands on this. This was one of the most complex beers I have had, and probably the best beer I have tried to date. Words cannot express how grateful I am for being one of the 11 to win a bottle last night.

4.92/5  rDev +6.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5A - Good amounts of lacing, dies down a bit as it warms up. Retention also diminishes as it warms, produces a couple finger's worth of head when first poured. Black and completely opaque.
S - Strong maple, coffee, hints of chocolate, and faint booziness.
T - Maple blends nicely into the chocolate, gives the dark chocolate a sweet but contained edge. Roasted coffee balances out the sweetness perfectly. In the centre of the palate you have notes of bourbon which add more depth, and perhaps a hint of vanilla as well (it's hard to tell with the maple). The flavours meld together exceptionally, while the base palate seems rather simple, I think that CBS seems more layered than KBS. The aftertaste consists mostly of the rich maple sweetness, but it's not overpowering or off-putting. Perfectly done stout, wish there was more of it readily available.
M - Great mouthfeel, quite creamy and smooth. Easy drinkability for a beer with this much flavour.
O - Outstanding beer, certainly worth the hype and steep price. Worthy of an A+. Will be hard to top this when it comes to Imperial Stouts. 1,097 charactersStarshipPoopers, Oct 15, 2011
5/5  rDev +8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A- very dark with a caramel colored head. Pours very thick
S- to die for. You can smell the mocha coffee, the bourbon, and syrup flavors. 
T- don't have tons of experience with ultra exclusive beers, but so far I can say this is the best tasting beer I have had so far. I still have not had KBS and a few others I have a feeling might be "the best", but so far, this is the best tasting beer ever! Very complex, robust, and delicious. The main mocha coffee, bourbon, and syrup flavors come through mostly, with some other amazing flavors as well. It also has a zesty kind of warm flavor to it, which I assume is the high alcohol content and bourbon presence. The taste is just insane and you never want it to stop. It's a crying shame it's only available for one day a year and in such limited quantities. Next time I'm going to buy at least 3.
M- very very smooth like velvet. Thick, luxurious, creamy, it's pretty much perfect.
O- can't say enough amazing things about this beer. Being a huge fan of Founders and having tried almost everything they make (even the special brews) this is definitely the best beer I've had so far, and imagine it will always be one of the best. You owe it to yourself to get a few of these every fall! Can't wait until next year! 1,266 charactersFoundersFanatic, Oct 15, 2011

4.85/5  rDev +4.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This 2011 bottle was happily opened with a strong anticipation. Shared with fellow BA CosmicEvan on a mission to enjoy quality beer. Served into a Duvel Goblet.
Appearance is really pleasing. It stands as dark as night and, upon a nice swirl, it develops a beautiful frothy head. A really nice pudding settles that prompts me to think I'm in for a true joy ride.
Smell is interesting. At first I was getting a ton of coffee. Now, as it settles in a bit, I'm getting more and more of a boozy bourbon smell. I want to catch the maple but I'm really not getting it yet. I'm still feeling trustful that it will come through in its flavor.
Taste is a dream come true. It starts off wonderfully sweet and creamy with plenty of maple (there it is!). A swirl of bourbon, vanilla, and molasses come through. There's a subtle chocolate in there too but it's not overpowering at all. 
Mouthfeel is excellent. Sweet dessert-like cream gives its way to a coffee float without being too sweet or cloying. I loved the number of stages I went though with this.
Overall an amazing experience. I am incredibly happy I obtained these beers and decided to sure them with friends and family instead of asking for someone's kidney in return for the beer. We found the whale, stuck her with a harpoon, and got everything we could out of her (scrimshaw anyone?). 1,343 charactersYagman3000, Oct 15, 2011

a - pours a lush black with a thin grey white head that vanishes leaving a ring on the surface. swirling the glass rebuilds for a moment. leaves traces of lacing on the glass. overall a bit thicker than your typical barrel aged brew, possiblely thickness from the maple syrup barrels? still has that glorious bourbon barrel aged shine.
s - the medley of soft milk chocolate with coffe and brown sugary bourbon sweetness is divine. the maple barrels add a layer of thickness to the wood from the bourbon. it gives it a down home sitting by the fire warmth. interesting to note that jeff and I used different glasses, me an oversized snifter, jeff an oversized duvel tulip...his was way more milk and creamy frappicino type drink. just love it.
t - Mmmm. Mmmm. luscious. rich. delicious. coffee and chocolate with bourbon maple delicately glazed over the top. seriously, it doesn't really get much better than this for my taste buds.
m - rich and lush with a delicate softness. quenching and cooling. the boozy tingle I normally look for is washed in maple richness for a silky cool after vibe.
o - overall, this beer is NOT overated. it rightfully earned the respect it has. this one is no joke. 1,254 characterscosmicevan, Oct 15, 2011
4.94/5  rDev +6.7%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Special thanks to my sister-in-law who used to live in Grand Rapids and was able to score one bottle of CBS. This may be the only bottle of CBS ever consumed in the Rio Grande Valley of deep south Texas. Founders doesn't do bad stouts, in my opinion, and this is no exception.
Poured into an open-mouthed stemless wine glass, just for kicks. Dark as midnight, with a light head that bears a slight reddish-orange tint. The nose is intense and all over the place. Yes, the maple is there, but this unmistakably a Founders stout. Dense, rich malt sweetness fused with an earthy smokiness. Tastes about the same, with a stronger vanilla presence as well. My wife said it tastes like "liquid ice cream" and I won't argue with that description. Delicious. Mouthfeel is very formidable. 
Perhaps the best beer I've had in a very long time. Maybe since my last KBS? Maybe. Really good stuff. If you can find this beer, and that's a big IF, consume as much as you can. It's incredible. 979 charactersAtlas1, Oct 15, 2011
4.52/5  rDev -2.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5I was invited to a beer tasting where one of the participants had a bottle of CBS. I've had this beer before on tap at the Extreme Beer Fest, but this was the first time I've tried it from the bottle.
CBS pours black into the glass, but has ruby highlights around the edges. The small light brown head fades down to a ring around the surface and leaves behind a fair amount of lace on the glass.
The aroma has notes of coffee and chocolate with some bourbon and alcohol mixed in.
Each sip of this full bodied beer is velvety on the palate. Light carbonation. The flavor is sweet and similar to the aroma with notes of coffee and chocolate blended with oak, roasted malt, and bourbon. The coffee is the most pronounced flavor, but doesn't overpower. I couldn't detect any maple in the beer. Once gone the coffee and bourbon flavor lingers on the palate.
This is a very tasty stout with a fantastic mouthfeel. It's too bad there's so much hype surrounding this beer. I'd love it to be more readily available. 1,010 charactersWanderingFool, Oct 14, 2011
4.67/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5I shared this bottle with some good friends last night. Poured into a 5oz tasting glass. Reviewed from notes.
A- Black with very little light penetration, red hues shine where the light does get through. A nice mocha-colored head sits atop this viscous liquid and leave a tight lacing in its tracks.
S- Whiskey, chocolate, vanilla, coffee, toasted malts and maple syrup
T- Espresso, dark chocolate, whiskey, maple syrup, hints of vanilla and toasted malts. The maple syrup comes through more at the end of the sip.
M- Not as thick as I had imagined it would be; although it wasn't thin by any definition of the word. It had a balanced carbonation level. It did leave a slight coating.
O- Overall, this was one of the best beers I have ever had. It lived up to the hype. The flavors were so well-balanced; nothing dominated to any degree. I wish I had more, but I am glad I got one bottle (and even happier that I got to share it with my friends). 951 charactersUngertaker, Oct 14, 2011
4.43/5  rDev -4.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from 750mL brown bottle into a clear glass snifter. No freshness or vintage date but from recent wide-range release. Purchased at Wine Warehouse (Charlottesville, VA) for $18.49. Thanks a lot Matthew.
A: Totally opaque black with plummy brown 2-finger head with good retention for the ABV and numerous streams of lace.
S: Delicious bourbon notes that grow in strength with warming. The dark malts are sumptuous and provide plenty of body. Coffee and roast come through but there is an undercurrent of caramel-maple sweetness there as well.
T: The flavor is much sweeter than either KBS or Imperial stout with the maple component really carrying sweetness throughout. The coffee is mostly present in the aftertaste, and the bourbon-whiskey contribution is more powerful with warming and time. The dark malt character is a little lost in the sweetness. Compared to KBS, FBS, and FIS, this is much sweeter and dessert-like.
M: The sweetness really adds a thick and chewy mouthfeel, even above and beyond FBS or KBS. THe carbonation is high and gives a more scrubbing quality that increases this drinkability of this beer. It is syrupy for sure but still drinkable due to the high carbonation.
O: This is a really great beer, but just a bit sweeter than optimal for me. KBS and FIS both outrank this guy, but I am really glad to have had the chance to give it a run. It is very unique, and a lightly smoked "bacon" or "Canadian bacon" version would be a great permutation to try. 1,487 charactersargock, Oct 14, 2011
4.77/5  rDev +3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5(A) This beer pours black as night. No light gets through when held up to a bulb. Forms a really dark brown head that sits up about a quarter to half inch.
(S) The aroma of this beer is pretty much what you would expect. Coffee, chocolate, maple syrup, some oak/wood, a touch of bourbon, a dryness and a hint of licorice.
(T) Just like the nose, dead on. Chocolate stood out to me first and foremost. The maple syrup was consistent throughout the flavor and gave it that even sweetness. Dark roasted malts helped bring up the foundation and give a robust coffee flavor that paired well with vanilla at the end. Excellent.
(M) Very smooth and big body. Thick and malty. It was easy on the palate and very enjoyable.
(O) This was so good I didn't want to finish it. Just fantastically crafted and well made. I love KBS and FBS and this is the best of both worlds and then some more. It's delectable. Worth the hype. 917 characterscjacobsen, Oct 13, 2011
4.75/5  rDev +2.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Pours nearly black with amber highlights. I was expecting a thicker and darker pour. I thought it would gloop into the glass like many stouts of this caliber do. It leaves a small dark brown head that leaves a pretty sticky lacing.
Chocolate, oak, maple syrup, roasted/burnt malts are in the aroma. A slight warming alcohol that is surprising subtle and well hidden. Vanilla and coffee are also dominant.
Loads of maple syrup, roasty malts chocolate, dark roasted coffee in the flavor. Bourbon has a large presence but it isn't harsh. Tastes like a nice smoky breakfast.
Thick and luxurious mouthfeel. Coats the mouth thoroughly. Sweet, but not cloying. Finishes with coffee and roasted bitterness.
Of course this beer was over-hyped, but it is an awesome beer. Everything I'd want in an imperial stout. Beers are like Dark Lord are impressive with the amount of flavor, but this is still a balanced, complex, flavorful stout, that isn't too alcoholic or sweet. 965 characterssjccmd, Oct 13, 2011
4.95/5  rDev +6.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Split with some close friends. You guys are welcome.
Appearance: Jet black and viscous as all get out. There is no light around the edges whatsoever. Poured somewhat aggressively to get a decent head, which remained throughout. The head is a creamy mocha with tight bubbles and quite attractive. Better yet, the lacing sticks to the glass as if it holding on for dear life. Basically, this is everything I look for in an Imperial Stout. The beer pours like molasses... at the very least like motor oil. Delicious molassesy motor oil. Mmmmm.
Smell: A vast array of aromas emanates from the glass. You get tons of coffee up front, with cocoa. There's definitely a vanilla and bourbon presence but they're kept in check and subdued by bouquet of smells. All too often, bourbon barrel aged beers go for too much bourbon and turn me off. CBS found a brilliant medium, second only to The Abyss. There's also a welcoming maple aroma blended in. It's definitely a boozey smelling beer but that is to be expected. Overall, it doesn't take away from the complexity and deliciousness of the beer. As it warms, the maple comes out a little more. 
Taste: Suffice it to say, CBS does not disappoint. This baby lives up to the hype. Everything you get in the nose is very apparent on the tongue. A very aggressive assault to the taste buds. There's vanilla and bourbon, coffee, chocolate, smokeyness (though rather subdued) and maple. It's sweet and bitter, both at the same time. Moreover, it's bittersweet when you realize you've finished your bottle. As it warms, the boozey qualities seem to diminish, though still noticeably present. As with the nose, the maple shines through when it warms.
Mouthfeel: Did I mention this bastard is viscous? I did? Because that's an understatement. This thing feels like pure syrup in your mouth. It's thick, chewy and sugary. I usually like thick type beer but this is slightly too much. I never thought I'd ever feel like a beer was too thick until today. I still love it, it's just past it's optimum thickness. Although I have one more, I can't see myself finishing a whole bottle alone.
Overall: Viscous, vicious and voracious Canadian Breakfast Stout is simply wonderful. It's almost everything that a barrel-aged stout should be and more. Part of me wishes I could go above and beyond 5s on some these measures. Believe the hype, CBS is that good. 2,382 charactersBmuncy, Oct 12, 2011

A - Pours a dark black with a mocha head with tints of ruby. The head is about a half finger thick. Lacing is really nice and creamy and there are patches of foam clouds in the middle.
S - Creamy, dark Belgium chocolate, light roast, caramel and maple syrup. Light oak and nice hints of bourbon. Tiny bits of char, tabacco leaf and candy like sugar.
T - Coffee and Espresso, roast, chocolate and really smooth bourbon. Maple syrup and a touch of peanut butter. Little bit of vanilla and oats as it warms.
M - Creamy carbonation and touch of heat from the barrel but it is well balanced with the roast of the coffee like flavors. Leaves the mouth a bit dry, just taking a drag off a nice cigar. 
O - Yep, this stuff is awesome. Lives up to the hype, although I didn't expect it to be as crazy as it is. Way tasty stuff and something that I really enjoyed. Glad I got another bottle hanging out to try again in the future. Believe the hype... 1,075 charactersjoshuaseresse, Oct 12, 2011

Black body and a thin brown head. Little bit of lacing. Smells of coffee and bitter chocolate primarily with some vanilla and bourbon. Powerful aroma on this one. The taste is more mellow and intermingled than I was expecting. Again, coffee and chocolate are the dominant players. I think I get some of the maple syrup in the aftertaste. Bitterness is higher than your average RIS. Carbonation seems mild. Very smooth mouthfeel, little thin compared to some others of this style. 
If you like big American imperial stouts you will love this beer. 621 charactersBierFan, Oct 12, 2011
4.46/5  rDev -3.7%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Served in a Duvel Tulip
Thick motor oil black body with a 2-1/2 finger caramel head and some nice lacing for an Imperial Stout.
Aromas of quality bourbon spiked coffee with freshly slit vanilla beans soaked in maple syrup, dark chocolatem and toasty caramel.
Bitter dark chocolate and hops, tons of sweet real maple syrup support with a good deal of bourbon, and smooth strong vanilla-scented coffee (the forefront flavor here). Less chocolate than KBS but there's definitely more vanilla, caramel, maple bourbon sweetness here.
Fullest of bodies. Thick and viscous. 5 out of 5 for the style taking into the account of the extreme smoothness and how it supports the flavor.
A truly excellent beer, but I have to say that I prefer KBS a bit more. KBS is less sweet, less bitter, with more bourbon, and it's more balanced with just as much flavor as CBS. 857 charactersaficionado, Oct 12, 2011

A-Another beautiful stout from Founders. Pours a jet black and is completely opaque. Dark as night with the slightest cocoa head that does not remain except for a thin coffee cream colored lacing. 
S-Lots of coffee and dark chocolate with a hint of cream and maple. 
T-Tastes a lot like the original breakfast stout however just more balanced. The aging has done wonders to this. There is a lot of coffee in this one which I was quite impressed with. A bit of a mocha latte bomb which I am fine with. As this gem warms up you can start to taste the maple syrup. It overall smooths the beer up and the bourbon is so subtle it is barely noticeable. 
M-So creamy and thick. Just a fantastic beer that you can roll around your mouth and enjoy its flavors. There is barely any carbonation as well which makes it so smooth and the alcohol is hardly there save for a final bite.
O-This beer is quite fantastic I will say that. I had this back to back with KBS and I think that these two are equally good. CBS is a smoother and tastier beer while KBS is more viscious and has a lot more bourbon kick. The thing is though as impressed I was by this beer it still is not the same as my first regular Founders Breakfast Stout. The first time I had the original I was blown away by it. This beer did not blow me away as how I was by the original but it is better. If I had never tried an FBS this would probably be the greatest beer I have had.
Update* 11-16-12
CBS on tap (fresh) is exceptional. Much more maple present than in any of the bottles I have had. My recommendation-Don't seek out bottles, just wait until it shows up on tap. 1,668 charactersbeerhan, Oct 11, 2011
5/5  rDev +8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured from first edition bottle release bomber into snifter 10/11/2011. Served at about 50 degrees and warming throughout drinking. Drank as breakfast. Totally stoked!
Appearance: Pours a completely opaque black with about 1/2 finger of chocolate head that dissipates into a thin tan film over the top. Has some pretty intense alcohol legs on the side of the glass. No lacing-- but its 10.6%ABV and a double stout...its okay. It looks spot on for the style.-- 5
Smell: Rich dark coffees, deeply roasted malts, a moderate amount of vanilla notes, dark semi-sweet chocolates, an undertone of some sweet maple syrup, and all held together by a fairly obvious bourbon booziness. I was surprised to find the maple syrup as subtle as it is. Its an incredibly complex beer in the nose. Surprisingly, the nose didn't just come out and knock me in the face. It definitely has some patience in the nose, and all the flavors seem to complement one another to form its own unique note of harmony. However, the bourbon is definitely a big note in this one. If you don't dig on big bourbon notes, it may be a turn off for you. But this brew is totally robust in every way-- 5
TASTE: Just wow. Big, huge chocolate and coffee notes are upfront, a sweet sticky maple syrup that shows restraint and is not overly sweet, wrapped up in with a BIG bourbon, bitter dark roast coffee, slightly dry and ever so slightly sweet finish. It might be the most masterfully blended and proportioned beer I have ever had. Absolutely no alcohol whatsoever-- its too wonderfully crafted. However, the bourbon is much bigger in this one than I expected. I interpret this as a well executed risk. Furthermore, the maple influence gives an accent to the original KBS style that blesses it with a certain sweetness and woodiness that gives it an influence that gives even more additional complexity. The maple syrup makes itself more well known as it warms, and it smooths out the big bourbon characters.-- TEN..a f***in TEN!
Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Thick, creamy, and heavy bodied. WOW! So silky in the mouth. It has almost the consistency in the mouth as a homemade cup of hot cocoa but with a bourbon burn. Moderately-low carbonation used to give some slight fizz but only as support to the dark, creamy feel of the overall body. It's master class and the elite example of mouthfeel for stouts. However, it is indeed a sipper. But if you are drinking CBS very fast, you aren't "getting" what it is. It is amazingly smooth, so please savor every last drop.-- 5
Overall: This is a magnificently dangerous beer. It feels so cliche and conformist to underwrite how great this beer is because most everyone says this. However, I cannot doubt that my fellow beer advocates have isolated a true masterpiece in brewing. I have thanked G-d I had the opportunity to try this beer. It has totally redefined my expectations of what is a great beer. People often wait to open the special brews for special occasions. I can tell you, without a doubt, that the special occasion is when you open and sip a bottle of CBS. Every once in a while the hype gets it right-- and its because Founders has dedicated themselves to being masters of their craft before being master's of getting their craft to everyone.-- 5
Criticism: My only criticism is that this one may be trying to do too much at the same time, and it may be too sweet for some barrel-aged elitists. Some will definitely find the KBS and the BS to be better than CBS because it (one) does not try to do as much "flavor packing" as CBS does and (two) the maple syrup adds sugar in a way that may perhaps prevent it from being a palate destroyer like KBS or a bit too overly rich juxtaposed to the BS. The maple syrup may perhaps be overkill for many. But CBS is an extreme beer. CBS in an extreme beer for those who enjoy extreme tastes. Is CBS the best beer in the world or even in the US? It might be. But, to absolutely make it the "king of beers" is to take the mystique out of craft beer and buy into the BMC marketing bull**** that a brewery like Founders refuses to buy into. 4,097 characterspaxchristi, Oct 11, 2011

A: Very dark in color, with a tan creamy head that lingers.
S: Initially the hints of maple syrup and mild bourbon smell hit you, which puts a smile on your face. Then the overwhelming coffee smell hits your nose. One of the nicest smelling beers I can remember.
T: The taste is incredible, delicious coffee taste with sweet malt/syrup taste. A mild warming in your chest as you savor the taste. Gets even better as the beer warms.
M: Creamy, and full bodied, yet not too thick. You know this beer has substance, but it is in no way one of those obnoxious overpowering stouts. It makes you want to immediately take another sip.
O: I went into the tasting thinking there was no way this beer could be as good as people say it is, but boy was I wrong! This is one of the best beers I have ever tried. The smell, taste, mouthfeel all are top notch. I could only imagine how it would taste on tap. I hope to get my hands on another bottle of this soon.

4.8/5  rDev +3.7%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5God I want this beer to be less tasty than it is (so as to bring some sanity to this beer) but I can't deny it...one of the best beers I've ever drank.
The color is really dark dark brown. Similar to one of its ingredients, the head is maple brown and creamy looking which is my favorite aesthetic. 
The smell is worthy of more than a 5 rating. Coffee dominates and sweet maple follows up. Exactly as promised and perfect. 
The flavor is great but comes in a little sweeter than I would like. It's a great sweetness (meaning that I like it enough) and fortunately, not cloying but I could do with slightly less. I suppose when you are drinking a beer that claims maple syrup as an ingredient this should be expected and I kinda did. Only enough to knock it to a 4.5. Roastiness lingers after the swallow, co-existing with the sweetness of the brew. This is phenomenal as it cleans up the aforementioned sweetness. Really solid.
The mouthfeel is the perfect viscosity in that it isn't syrupy but is heavy enough. Creamy but not too much. Perfect.
Overall, this beer is exactly what you would hope it to be based on its description and that carries a lot of weight with me. Many beers say they are conditioned with this and that yet you can't taste those elements. This beer is breakfast (coffee/roast), maple syrup (sweet) and bourbon-y.

4.37/5  rDev -5.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured into a 23 oz snifter. Jet black with smallish light tan head that was difficult to achieve even with vigorous pouring. Thins out to a slight tan film on top. Lacing is strong however. Smell is mostly of coffee and bourbon, with dark maltiness as well. So far, this smells a lot like KBS to me. The taste however, is very different. Bourbon is not nearly as prevalent in the taste. coffee is also much milder. hint of sweetness from the syrup and becomes much more prevalent as the beer warms up. ABV is well hidden though definitely present. Body is medium, not as thick as I expected and not a lot of coating though there is definitely an aftertaste that lingers. 
Overall, this one is solid, up there with the other "Breakfast" stout offerings though different. The smell is definitely the best part. Subtlety (as far as barrel-aged stouts are concerned) is what sets this one apart for me. Bourbon and coffee are definitely much more mild in this beer than KBS. The maple is a nice touch but not as strong as other reviewers seem to indicate. This is the third beer I've had from these barrels (kaiser curmudgeon and Cashew Moutain Brown) and I've never gotten a strong maple presence. Definitely digging this nonetheless. The definition of "smooth." 1,261 charactersBlanco, Oct 10, 2011

A: Thick, dark body with a beautiful creamy head.
S: I had this with another beer geek and we both agreed this is the best-smelling beer we had ever encountered. It was like the sweetest dark coffee of all time. I love dark coffee served black, and this was like the best coffee brew I've ever smelled, plus a malty sweetness to back it.
T: Coffee. Oh yes, so much rich, dark coffee. Where coffee flavors this deep and dark might make a lesser beer bitter, there is a beautiful malt back to it that balances everything out. I savored every sip, and it only improved as the beer warmed.
M: I wish I could feel this with every beer. There was a beautiful fullness that I can't aptly describe. A warming as it went down from the ABV, but the maltiness on the tongue prevent any boozy flavor.
O: Incredible. This is my favorite aroma of any beer. The taste is nearly equally amazing. I had serious doubts about this beer because of its god-like status on BA, but it delivered. Thank you, Founders. This beer alone made my night. 1,182 charactersbramsdell, Oct 10, 2011

4.97/5  rDev +7.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I've heard about "angels pissing on your tongue." This angel was loaded on Bald Eagle heads and Faberge eggs.
750mL bottle poured into a Duvel tulip glass on an unusually warm (hot) fall afternoon.
A- So rich. A normal pour created a 1-1/2 finger, dense, brown head. The deep, deep brown body looks nearly black through the middle of the glass. The head falls to a nicely covering, bubbly film. There are great sticky spots left all about the glass.
S- While really cold and in the bottle I got a chocolate and roasted aroma. It really opens up after the pour with a ton of vanilla and Bourbon-like qualities. There's a sweet, brown sugar scent that reminds me of a packet of "Sugar in the Raw." Sugary qualities begin to come out more like maple syrup. Medium-dark roast coffee. Somewhat of a "Coffee Crisp" chocolate bar at points. It's so complex. More semi-sweet chocolate later on. Even raisin-like at times.
T- Like Heaven on the tongue. Semi-bitter chocolate early. Brown or unrefined sugar and maple syrup. There are underlying raisin-like qualities at first. Smooth alcohol, especially in the finish. Vanilla notes I'd associate with a nice Bourbon. A hint of wood. There's the slightest of lingering sweetness. It's all very "dessert-like." I'm picturing a decadent, double chocolate fudge cake. There's coffee in the background. The raisins go away with some warmth leaving all chocolate, vanilla, maple, and some lighter coffee.
M- It's rich and creamy. VERY full bodied. There's some slightly warming alcohol that not harsh, whatsoever. Light carbonation. Velvety.
O- Absolutely no let-down here. While incredibly smooth days after purchase, I'd love to try some with a year or more on it. I'd also like to do this as a nightcap on a chilly evening. While pricy, I feel it's worth every penny. I got to a point with this where I was looking hard for a flaw and the best I've got is slightly poor head retention. 1,930 charactersGRPunk, Oct 09, 2011
4.8/5  rDev +3.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Shared this bottle at the UFC tasting. We did the Founders horizontal leading up to this guy (Imperial Stout, Breakfast Stout and KBS). I had this on tap at Founders at the release day and after having it out of the bottle I figure it deserves a proper review. Poured out of a 750 ml bottle into a Deschutes snifter.
A: Pours a jet black with a great mocha colored head that lingers for a bit and resides to brown swirls and nice ring around the edge. 
S: The maple syrup and the barrel really shine in the smell. Nice roasted coffee with a sweet vanilla and chocolate. 
T: The coffee is more prevalent in the taste and is backed by a nice chocolate. Sweet vanilla mixes with the maple syrup and really makes the barrel shine. There is a little booze kick at the end to remind you that it's there. Everything is integrated so beautifully. Really fucking good.
M: Heavy bodied with a smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Wonderfully carbonated to keep you stimulated. I could drink this every day.
O: This beer lived up to the hype and more for me. It's a shame that everyone is making this a whale, but I know I'll be able to have it again soon. 1,142 charactersTreebs, Oct 09, 2011
4.8/5  rDev +3.7%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Had this alongside a 2 year old FBS, what a treat thanks to to the generous guys that shared this!
A- Pours black with brown sugar head that sticks to the side of the glass.
S- Smells amazing, can pick up the maple and vanilla hints but is more full of coffee.
T- wow, this is smooth. Subtle coffee upfront followed by sweet malts, hints of chocolate and definitely maple. The bourbon is hid very well but there is a little heat kick on the end. Not as much complexity as I would have liked but it is really well balanced!
M- It has a medium thickness and a stickiness that helps it linger a bit in your throat. a slight hint of bourbon hotness. 
O- This was definitely one of the best barrel aged stouts I've tried. I'm not sure if I can hold off the bottle I have, but I want to try this next to KBS & FBS soon. 818 charactersfo1ksguitar, Oct 09, 2011
4.97/5  rDev +7.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Aroma: Huge coffee and dark chocolate right up front with maple syrup just peeking through. A touch of bourbon is there to remind you that this isn't your ordinary Imperial Stout.
Appearance: A black hole of darkness with a creamy 1-finger tan head. Thin sheets of sticky lace cling to the side, only to be enveloped by each swirl of the glass.
Taste: While some beers give you a certain impression from the aroma that doesn't quite match the taste, that's certainly not the case with CBS. Center stage is the coffee and bitter chocolate, but the maple syrup adds a touch of sweetness to balance it all out. A seductive hint of bourbon provides just a fleeting warmth, but certainly does not steal the show.
Mouthfeel: Viscous, a little oily and coats the entire mouth in sweet delicousness. Medium carbonation rounds out the experience.
Overall: In my opinion, this is nearly perfectly balanced, but allows the chocolate and coffee to shine just a bit more than the other components. Let this bad boy warm up a bit before drinking so that all of the aroma and flavor can come out. This certainly isn't an after-work refresher, but instead a rich, decadent dessert that I'll choose over cake (and I love cake) any day. 1,222 charactersthebeerisgood, Oct 09, 2011

This beer pours pitch black with about 1-2 fingers worth of a beautiful brown colored head. The smell is bourbon right away followed by coffee and vanilla. This beer taste great. Right away I could taste the massive amounts of coffee followed by the bourbon kick. After that theres the taste of chocolate and vanilla followed by the sweet taste of the maple. This beer leaves a nice creamy texture in the mouth and a nice slight burn in the throat from the bourbon. This is a great stout. 548 charactersLabonix, Oct 09, 2011
4.76/5  rDev +2.8%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5750ml bottle served in a snifter.
pours your standard imp. stout used motor oil black while yielding a 3/4" mocha-toned head that slowly fades to a lasting cap, leaving some nice patches of lacing. very nice appearance, particularly for a style where it can be hard to distinguish yourself.
in the nose, coffee explodes out of the gate; joined by secondary notes of chocolate, roasted malt, maple, and a touch of vanilla. not picking up much bourbon. very good, but far from transcendent. gives me pause: could the famed CBS amount to an overvalued let-down?
fortunately the answer here is a resounding no. taste exceeds the aroma by a fair margin, delivering rich, tasty flavors in spades. coffee, chocolate, roasted malt, vanilla, maple, toffee, and boubon... the more it warms the more these characteristics emerge. it's not a bourbon bomb - nothing along the line of BCBS or older viscosity - but even though i'm a bourbon fan this doesn't diminish my enjoyment of the beer. nice maple sweetness gives it a distinctive flair. smooth, velvety, medium-full bodied with medium carbonation.
overall i have to go A+ here. hype or no, IMO there's no denying this is just a delicious, flavorful beer. fantastic; if they ramp up the bourbon a bit (production numbers would also be nice) i think i'd have a serious contender for overall favorite beer. hell, i might have one anyway. 1,381 charactersperrymarcus, Oct 09, 2011

A -Pitch black with minimal tan head, which dissipates quickly leaving a few patches of bubbles and some lacing. Looks like a great imperial stout. 
S – Strong bourbon and maple presence, along with light notes of chocolate and dark fruits. Smells amazing!
T – Wow this beer is complex. Strong bourbon punch to begin with, and the maple taste follows almost immediately with a hint of burnt sugar and chocolate. Light warming sensation from the alcohol, very pleasant. The best-tasting imperial stout I have ever tried, to date. 
M – Lightly carbonated, thick on the tongue. Near-perfect balance. 
O – I am very impressed. This is great fresh, but it would be a good candidate for further aging. If there is a better imperial stout, I have yet to find it. 869 charactersgregy55902, Oct 09, 2011
5/5  rDev +8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I drank this out of a standard English pub glass. It poured blacker than dirty fucking oil. I LOVED THE APPEARANCE. OH SHIT!!! The smell was of coffee, some chocolate, some vanilla, some bourbon, some sugar maple syrup qualities. AMAZING!!! Taste was like taking the breakfast stout, and putting it on steroids, and then aging it in maple syrup-bourbon barrels. It was titty. The mouthfeel was fucking smooth. I could drink 124 of them, though I would probably die, but it would be well worth it because it is better than anything. I love it more than anything, even more than my girlfriend, and I broke off our marriage because of this fucking beer!!! I just love it, and Founder's, I love you as well. Founder's if you are listening to this. Please reward me with more CBS for free. Much appreciated. Overall. If you didn't drink this, you are fucking stupid, and don't fucking talk to me you fat fucking piece of shit. I would pay $50.00 for a bottle of this. I love you Founder's.

I poured this into a glass mug.
The appearance was black as fuck. It looked like a great stout. It poured a sexy brownish maple sexy as fuck head.
The smell was great. Maple syrup, coffee, chocolate, bourbon, vanilla, It was fucking great.
The taste was the same as the smell basically. It was sweet, and delicious. YUM!!!
Mouthfeel: It was so good. Such a great mouthfeel. YUM!

4.55/5  rDev -1.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5750 poured into two snifters
A - Pours black as night with a frothy 1/2 inch thick head
S - is very similar to KBS, very earthy with hints of chocolate, coffe, and bourbon
T - is very chocolatey with lots of maple and bourbon notes. The taste really separates this beer from founders other breakfast stouts. It leaves a sweetness on the palette that's decadent and deliscous
M - is very creamy and smooth on the palette with a little sting of alcohol on the back end which is otherwise hidden by the sweetness. Carbonation is on the low side as expected.
O - A very good beer. Glad we had a chance to try it. I will definitely seek this out again. It also makes us want to try other maple infused beers as well as experimenting with it in our homebrew. 757 charactersBumpkinBrewer, Oct 09, 2011

4.94/5  rDev +6.7%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 522 oz. bottle purchased at Canary Square in Jamaica Plain (Boston), MA.
Pours a thick, inky black. May be the blackest beer I've ever seen. Almost no head, what little foam is there looks more like the bubbles I get when I shake up a chocolate milk, and fades very, very quickly. Might be the only downside to this beer.
The smell knocked me off my chair, and I literally sat smelling it for a good five minutes before I took my first sip. One of the richest, most complex noses I've ever smelled, it's full of chocolate, ground coffee, bourbon, oak, and a slight bit of smoke.
For as good as the nose was, the mouth was even better. Tremendously complex, there is a lot of maple syrup (without ever being too sweet), oak, bourbon and dark rum (but no real hint of booziness), prunes, dried fruit, and an incredible balance with both milk and bittersweet chocolate flavors. In my initial tastes, I was noticing the bitter chocolate undertones, but as it sat, the chocolate became milkier and milkier. Like the nose, there is also a very subtle smokiness hiding in the background.
This beer has a silken mouthfeel; I felt as though my tongue was getting wrapped in velvet. Easily the best mouthfeel of any beer I've had before.
Overall, this is easily the best of its class. I have never had a stout that comes near its equal: it is the perfect balance of flavors, wildly complex, always evolving, yet in the end, so drinkable I could sit and sip it all night. 
If you can get your hands on one, it is well worth the price.
[It is worth noting that my bottle stated the ABV was 10.4%, not 9.4% listed on BA] 1,613 charactersrinhaak, Oct 09, 2011
4.95/5  rDev +6.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5a- Pitch black with minimal head that left quite a bit of lacing after giving it a swirl.
s- Bourbon and dark chocolate up front. The syrup seems to grow more prominent as it warms, overall very sweet. The bourbon and maple smell wonderful together.
t- Bourbon, chocolate, and coffee. As with the smell, the syrup comes out more as it sits. The alcohol is completely hidden. An incredible and dangerous stout
m- Very thick and sticky with low carbonation. I feel that this is where the maple syrup comes into play. It's such a strange thing and it fits so well.
o- Incredibly balanced and delicious, as well as innovative and different. It's unfortunate that this beer isn't more available, I suppose it just adds to the allure. My only complaint is that I can't get another bottle without thoroughly punishing my checking account. 835 charactersjtmcgraw, Oct 09, 2011

A: Dark as can be with an encouragingly rich brown head.
S: Reminds me a lot of KBS. There is definitely some extra sweetness detectable, but it's not overpowering maple by any means. Delicious bourbon and coffee.
T: Everything you'd hope for with nothing over powering anything else. Coffee dominates BS. Alcohol is usually present in KBS. The maple monster does not rear its head. The maple mainly acts as a way to polish the potentially rough/boozy edges with a little sweetness, but not too much.
M: Velvety and full bodied with zero burn. 
O: This is a more refined version of KBS. More please. Maybe with bacon next time? An egg? 763 charactersmystikyle71, Oct 09, 2011

Now that being said the CBS once it warmed was really awesome and really gave off some great notes of oak and a very slight maple. 
The beer had a light wispy head lots of lacing and a fantastic smell.
The taste was port like and got better as it warmed.
Overall I was fotunate to try some and glad I did. It is a great beer dark and worth trying. 450 charactersCasey10, Oct 08, 2011
4.97/5  rDev +7.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5750 ml bottle. Served in a DFH snifter, the brew pours dark brown/black with about an inch light brown head. The head stays around a little while, and there's a good amount of lacing left behind on the glass. The aroma is wonderful, it smells like chocolate, coffee, maple, roasted and charred/burnt malt, vanilla and bourbon. The taste is pretty much just like the aroma, but with the chocolate, coffee, maple and roasted/burnt malt flavors starting out the strongest, and the bourbon/vanilla flavors getting stronger as the beer warms up more. Mouthfeel/body is full, it's rich, creamy and coating, with a moderate amount of carbonation. It's very easy and enjoyable to drink. I think it's an excellent overall brew, it's easily in my Top 10 favorite beers. I'm just glad I was lucky enough to get a bottle of this, it really is a great beer. 844 charactersbluejacket74, Oct 08, 2011
4.77/5  rDev +3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Had on tap at Palm Tavern, 8oz pour into a snifter.
A: The blackest of black pours, with a one finger milk-chocolate colored head. Head faded quicker than I would've liked, knocking this down from top marks. Beer was also served at probably 40 degrees, which may or may not have affected things.
S: First smell: HOLY CRAP BOURBON. Like, "smells more bourbon-y than KBS" bourbon. I feel that's due to the fact that it was poured colder than intended. As the beer warms, you the bourbon fades a bit as hints of coffee, cocoa, black malts, and faint hints of maple sweetness come through. Could be a bit more balanced than KBS, but will have to save that for a side by side tasting at home.
T: Again, the first taste is similar to the first smell: BOURBON. As it warms though, the coffee and cocoa begin to become prime players. The bourbon sits pleasantly in the background. While the maple is always a faint player, it's not as pronounced as I had expected.
M: This defines sticky-sweet. Where the maple really shows up is on the superb coating the beer leaves as it goes down your throat and on the syrup-like feeling you get on your lips as you drink your glass. Carbonation is low but appropriate, resulting in a great feeling beer.
O: I have to say it's one of the best beers I've ever had. Founders really knows what they're doing when it comes to -bbal beers, and CBS is no different. I wish it was easier to get ahold of, but I am glad to have gotten to try this titan of the beer world. 1,498 charactersduffcalifornia, Oct 08, 2011
4.92/5  rDev +6.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Had this on tap at Pizzeria Paradiso in Dupont two days ago. I was super fortunate to be able to sit down and casually order too many pours of this, I hope beer karma doesnt come back and bite me for drinking so many, it just is so good I couldn't help myself...
A: Beautiful jet black color with reverse cascading head the settles to a ring of brown head. Webs of lacing are left as I drink this too fast.
S: Absolutely amazing smell, one of the better smelling beers ever I'd say. Dripping with espresso and chocolate, there are some great smoky notes that lead to a hearty sugary Vermont grade A syrup aroma. I sit and think this reminds me of the smell you would smell when you sat down to a hearty breakfast at an amazing Inn in Vermont or Canada or Maine or something with amazing pancakes in syrup and smoky and savory bacon/sausage too. Just a great aroma, so much going on. 
T: The taste is great as well of course. To me, it drinks like Breakfast stout in a lot of ways though the coffee is subtler (which I like) and there are layers of added flavor from the maple which actually comes through clearly to my delight, and some lingering hop esters/bitters and espresso. Chocolate and vanilla both are nice additives to the maple note. A spiciness in there with things like cinnamon and even hot peppers subtly weaving into the overall flavor experience. This would be THE dessert beer of all time. 
M: Nice carbonation level and smooth over the palate, nice and chewy.
Overall, an amazing beer and an experience. When I had the first batch last year I was not impressed, I think they really upped their game this year, one of the tastiest brews from them, about even with KBS though I might prefer this one. Awesome. 1,731 charactersDreadnaught33, Oct 08, 2011

4.82/5  rDev +4.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5750ml bottle poured into a Mikkeller wine glass. Finally I get to try this beast!
A - Pours an obsidian black color, completely opaque and totally devoid on any hint of color at all. It gradually builds a mocha-colored head, finally culminating in about 2-fingers of height with great retention. The head is comprised of large soapy bubbles that give it some topography. The lacing is spotty, but it does grip in some places while leaving some good alcohol legs.
S - The nose hits me right away, and I immediately harken back to KBS in the way the bourbon plays and develops with the coffee that is so strong in FBS (even though FBS isn't used as a base for these beers, of course). Bold, fresh coffee roast is at the forefront and lasts for a long time, while the bourbon comes in shortly after to give it a bit of sweetness. Big chocolate notes as well, which are are rich and inviting. I actually find the maple syrup a little hard to pinpoint and if it wasn't specifically mentioned, I would have a hard time pinpointing it exactly.
T - Even from my first sip, it tastes phenomenally. it has all of the things I loved about FBS and KBS, and expands on it even more. The coffee is eye-opening, freshly pressed and contributes a distinct roastiness that persists throughout the entire bottle. The bourbon acts as the perfect side-kick; always there to provide a helping hand and complexity, but doesn't overstep its bounds, and for someone who loves bourbon-aged beers, I actually would wish it were even a bit stronger. The chocolate as well is almost like it's malted, that's how smooth, rich, and decadent it is within the scope of the beer. But this is CBS, not KBS, so what about the maple syrup? Thankfully, unlike the nose, the taste does have a distinct maple flavor that comes in around halfway through and gives it an additional kick of sweetness. Much like KBS, it does have a somewhat strong alcohol kick, but it doesn't seem out of place and it isn't offensive.
M - Mouthfeel is moderately heavy with good carbonation. Full-bodied with a feel that covers the entire palate and sticks around with a good coating. Long lasting sweetness from the chocolate and maple syrup.
D/O - Drinkability is high. I never got to try this on tap before, so this is my first exposure to the famed CBS and I have to say it has lived up to my expectations. The adjectives that immediately come to mind are ones of high praise, from decadent, to gourmet, to incredibly rich. While FBS and KBS tend to be somewhat bitter, this beer is actually quite sweet, so that's probably the major difference between this one and its predecessors (besides the maple), which is worth noting. Plain and simple, this is excellence in beer form and is worthy of any and all praise it receives. 2,776 charactersnhindian, Oct 08, 2011
4.82/5  rDev +4.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Now I can see what all the hype is about. 750 ml. bottle, poured into a snifter.
A: Black as night with a huge tan head that settles slowly to a thin surface film. For a beer of this gravity, the lacing is actually quite outstanding. One of the best looking beers I have had of the style.
S: This beer smells like what it is supposed to be. Up front, chocolate, coffee, and syrup, along with roasty undertones of scorched bread. Dark dried fruit lingers, while hops add a floral backround.
T: Wow! All I can say is that this beer is a kaleidoscope of insanity! Sweet and boozy right off the bat, but hints of caramel, chocolate and maple strike the palate as if I was eating chocolate chip pancakes. Hints of toast and coffee make up the middle, along with some prune and raisin while the beer finishes slightly dry, with a warming effect.
Notes: This beast is full-bodied, complex, and one of the easiest-going stouts of this caliber that I have ever tried. I can truly see what the hype is about. It has everything going for it. Smooth as all Hell, but I think a few months in the bottle would do this beer some good. Glad I had a chance to try it. 1,154 charactersWYVYRN527, Oct 08, 2011

4.7/5  rDev +1.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Purchased from my little hidden gem in Northern WI for $16.99 a bottle. Poured into Founders Snifter, shared with Emily.
Appearance: Winner right off the bat. A beautiful black pour with a frothy two finger creamy/coffee colored head. Dissipates slowly leaving some great lacing and nice bubbles around edge of glass. A few swirls leaves a nice slow to fall lacing...really impressive appearance. I hardly ever rate over a four in the appearance category, but this one gets the nod. 
Smell: Immediate hit of bourbon, but not overpowering some nice notes of coffee, fudge, and vanilla. Some oak notes support the sweet base. That sweet maple really shines, and it is impressive. I could nose this beer all day and night. 
Taste: Big burst of coffee, followed by sweet notes of bitter chocolate, vanilla, and some slight bourbon. Boom, the maple comes through with a wonderful mellowing sweetness. The roasted malt really gives this beer some great backbone. Some spice that melds well with everything else that is going on. Very little alcohol to speak of, less so than KBS. 
Mouth: Beautiful creamy texture that really brings the nose and taste together. The alcohol isn't hot on the palate, but apparent in a good way. 
Drink and overall: Well, the CBS definitely lived up to the hype. Was it worth all the effort to get one bottle? Sure, I'm glad that I tried it. Great product. Very drinkable for being over 10% A.B.V., and having so much going on. Really a quality brew, deserving of the high praise it has received. 1,525 charactersMarcatGSB, Oct 08, 2011

A: Looks like a great imperial stout! Ink black with a two finger khaki colored head, great lacing down the glass. 
N: Predominant smell of alcohol (whiskey) with maple sweetness and chocolate in contention and coffee base. A bit too much bourbon aroma for my liking, but that is just my personal preference.
T: Early hit of whiskey but not too stong or overpowering and no heat from any alcohol. Maple sweetness and coffee come in to balance and bitter chocolate flavors are there to round this beer out. Fantastic!!
M: Viscous, thick just like an imperial stout should be. Perfect.

4.75/5  rDev +2.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5A - Pours a very viscous, used motor oil black/brown with nice, mocha colored head with great retention and lacing along the sides of the glass. Good looking beer.
S - Good amount of sweet bourbon in the nose, roasted coffee, cocoa, licorice, hazelnut, vanilla, and a bit of that nice maple syrupy. Even a bit of a rich, smokey scent to it. Lots of good scents coming to work here.
T - Oh wow. All those smells form a delicious confluence of taste here. The bourbon that I felt was so prominent in the nose seems to take a backseat here to that sweet maple, bitter chocolate, and the roasted coffee, and a dash of vanilla. The beer is incredibly smooth and provides a great balance of bitterness, sweetness, and booze. I was afraid I wouldn't be able to taste the maple, but the syrup really plays a great role in balancing out the bourbon.
M - This beer is so creamy and smooth, you "feel" the alcohol more than taste it. Perfect mouthfeel.
Overall - Superb, a great beer. Admittedly, the issues I ever had with KBS seems to be ironed out so well in CBS. The maple provides a perfect balance to this beer. Overall, an amazing beer. 1,136 charactersBeerBuckeye, Oct 07, 2011

4.5/5  rDev -2.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5As lavish and lush as any beer I've had. The culmination of roast, espresso, maple sweetness, malted milk, and bittersweet chocolates is nearly overcomming, but is also charming in its simplicity.
The beer opens with an extremely creamy and volumnous pour. A creamy tan head forms on at the top of the glass as the opaque black beer settles and cascades while the foam rises. The head reliquishes some control because of the emmensity of alcohol. Amazing to see this amount of foam character from such an alcoholic and syrupy beer.
Dominant in its aromas of espresso, cocoa beans, nutty maple, and roasted barley take hold of the nose. But their intensity is unmistakable. Strong bourbony alcohol scent rises as the beer warms and stimulates the olfactory senses. Simple in variety, but complex in strength.
Flavors continue where aromas end. Extreme flavors of espresso, cocoa, maple syrup sweetness, and roasted barley set the tone. Malt sweetness amplifies with maple contributions while medium attenuated malt flavor gives a sturdy foundation to support the robust complementary flavors. Smoky sweetness accompany the cocoa-coffee attack. Esters and phenolic spice are also foregone thus limiting its complexity. Bourbon alcohol flavors are evident and gives a bit more fullness to the taste.
The mouthfeel is structual and heavy. Creamy, rich, and round while also smooth, velvety, and somewhat sweetish in weight. Bitterness arrives from a lot of angles: hops, espersso, cocoa, and alcohol. Avoiding a cloying feel, the beer has finishes malty-rich with lingering maple syrup flavor in aftertaste.
A very rounded and sweeter variety to the ever stable KBS with maple sweetness that shares the stage with coffee and bourbon. These offer a part of a distraction and a complex note all at once. Complex in its sheer proportions of relatively few dominant flavors, yet simple in its intent. Coffee- Cocoa- Malt- Maple. And it succeeds at every faucet. It has earned its way onto the worlds greatest beers and rightfully so. 2,030 charactersBEERchitect, Oct 07, 2011

S - Right off the bat you get coffee with sweet tones of maple syrup. There are woodsy bark notes mixed in with strong cocoa, vanilla, and what I will call a hint of bacon. Absolutly awesome nose that gets bigger and more robust with some warmth.
T & M & D - Coffee, maple, syrup, bacon, chocolate all mixed together in an incredibly smooth sip. The beer is so well balanced and manages to represent all the flavors without overwhelming the palate. With all the flavors and the boldness of the beer you would expect it to be a sipper. Quite the opposite - the beer is so balanced and awesome that it goes down smoother than a milkshake and begs you to have more. It is a party in your mouth.
O - What a fantastic beer. One of the best of the styles I have had - I really looked long and hard for this beer and it did not disappoint. I am glad I found it on draft - now I am interested ot see what some age does to the bottle I picked up.

A - Pours a gorgeous dark brown almost black with a nice 0.25 inch head that is nice and light tan. The head is nice and dense and recedes at a slightly quick pace. A nice swirl kicks it up a bit with a 1 inch light tan head. Nearly perfect looking beer.
S - Starts off with some coffee aroma followed by some nice dark chocolate bitterness as well as some nice chocolate sweetness. There are some nice There is some slight vanilla notes present as well as some nice Bourbon notes. There is definitely a nice chocolate sweetness mixed in with some slight maple syrup aroma. Very appealing and enticing aroma.
T & M - Wow. This beer is nearly perfect. The pour doesn't indicate how creamy and smooth this beer feels. The beer starts off with some nice slight chocolate sweetness with some nice dark chocolate bitterness. The beer is soooo smooth. There is some nice slightly roasted coffee notes that match up perfectly with the slight subtle chocolate sweetness. There is a nice maple syrup note that flashes up between the nice roasted coffee notes and the milk chocolate notes. There is some nice maple syrup sweetness during the finish as well as some Bourbon and some nice slight alcohol hotness.
O - This beer was great. It is definitely not over-hyped IMO. They should make this regularly. Very smooth and creamy. Well balanced because its not too sweet and not too roasty. Perfect balance and perfect mouthfeel. 1,469 charactersJoEBoBpr, Oct 07, 2011

A: Dark black pour with light brown/tan thin head, moderate lacing.
S: Smelled sweet, mostly bourbon and coffee, hints of syrup and vanilla.
T: Nice balance of the major elements, coffee, bourbon, and chocolate. Delicate, but present maple syrup taste, not overpowering. Sweet, but balanced.

4.65/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5CBS, bottle bought at Whole Foods in Manhattan for $14.99 (thanks to the best beer guy in the world!)
Appearance: Poured into my Sierra snifter, CBS goes out thick and black and beautifully carbonated, producing a two-finger head with thick bubbles. Very good and balanced lacing, retention and carbonation. 
Smell: Lotta wood, some booze. Liquorice, sweetness. Tad of vanilla, coffee grounds. 
Taste: Here is where the maple syrup shines and comes through. I wasn't sure *how* maple tastes, so I reached for a small bottle of pure Canadian maple syrup I keep in my kitchen cupboard. Sure enough, this is it. Sweet, enticing, thick, honey-like. I had a sip of maple syrup and then a sip of CBS and I knew that was it. Coffee and outrageousness follows, plus an exceptional creaminess (as in, "I want half-and-half in my coffee") and a crazy-dry finish that had me reaching for water. Sugar and chocolate tossed around.
Mouthfeel: Truly outstanding. Rich but not overbearing, creamy, well-balanced, delicious, not boozy. As you sip, the carbonation feels lower than it looked as it poured out. This is up there with Goose Bourbon Rare and Vanilla. My favorite kind of brew!
Overall: Needless to say, this is exceptional (as in, "5"). Because they dare to use such a thing as a maple-syrup barrel. Because it is so tremendously well balanced. Because it is so disgustingly tasty. And because it has got no trace of booziness despite the hefty ABV. CBS!!! 1,457 charactersDoubleSimcoe, Oct 07, 2011
3.78/5  rDev -18.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Ink black stout with a light tan colored head. Solid, sticky retention and sticks to the glass well. Lighter color head than expected but exceptional retention for the style.
Dark and sweet aromas. Lots of maple, hint of bourbon and some figs.
Deeply sweet malt flavor. Complex maple, dark fruit and molasses sweetness up front. Chocolate character comes in mid-drink and dominates the rest of the way. Mild coffee flavor provides a bitter balance. Not too much to say about the hops, they are really over-powered by the malt and maple syrup. Not bad, just too sweet for my taste.
Thick and syrupy body. Sticky. Mildly carbonated. Feel is slick with a syrupy stickiness.
Not bad. Very complex flavor. Just sweeter than I like my stouts. 740 charactersbnes09, Oct 06, 2011
5/5  rDev +8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5After calling 25 (yes, 25) local and not-so-local stores looking for a bottle of this today, I finally stumbled upon one. This is a beer that had always eluded me, and I was thrilled to finally get to try it. It pours with a glistening thickness that immediately sticks to the side of the glass, smelling of fresh coffee that's been bludgeoned with mocha and maple. Absolutely delicious. The taste brings all that's right about KBS with a sweet blanket of additional smoothness brought on by the maple. The flavor is simultaneously restrained and bold, mild and audacious. The mouthfeel is reminiscent of excellent stouts like Bourbon County Rare, slick and oily with only a bit of a carbonation and alcohol tingle (but I don't mean that in the creepy undercarbonated way - this beer tastes fresh and well [correctly] carbonated). The best beer I've had to date, period. My first 5. 882 charactersmfunk9786, Oct 06, 2011
4.05/5  rDev -12.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4A- Appearance is your typical good looking stout, dark brown just about black body with a creamy coffee colored head.
S- Lots of roasted coffee grinds some vanilla brown sugars and honey.
T- Sweetness from the syrup and acidic bitterness from the coffee intermingle with each other. Maple syrup plays a more supporting role I would have liked to see more of it than the coffee being that Ive had the coffee experience with FBS and KBS.
M- Really creamy probably the creamiest brew Ive had slithering across my tongue.
O- Excellent brew. Worth skipping work or paying some crazy premium? My palette says no, the taste just does not match up to the hype for me. 663 charactersfoogerd, Oct 06, 2011

A: Like the blackest coffee you have ever seen. Lots of thin and foamy tan head. Lots of lacing. 
S: Like a drunken breakfast in a glass. Coffee, syrup and bourbon all in one. 
T: Delightful. Immediate sweetness from the maple followed by coffee tones. The coffee tones are then followed by a pleasant bourbon heat. Amazing. So much going on here.
M: Not the chewiest stout I have ever had, but still very thick. Well carbonated.

5/5  rDev +8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5On-tap at Churchkey in DC yesterday. 
Arrived in a snifter. Jet black with a finger of light brown head. Head lingered for a bit before falling to a whisp on top. A beautiful beer to look at but even better to smell. Smell is like a very nice chocolate/coffee desert with a good bit of cream as well. I'm thinking coffee ice cream or espresso anglaise. 
Taste here is phenomenal, maybe the most beautifully balanced beer I've had. Maple is probably most prominent and you can almost taste the wood from the barrels. Fades to chocolate and cream and then a really great cappacinno flavor. Slightly bitter but very creamy. Really helps to balance out the maple and chocolate. 10% alcohol is perfect as well, it's there for sure and this beer certainly warmed me up, but I never got any alcohol burn, smooth all the way. Lacing after several sips is excellent, beautiful light brown spiderwebs all over the glass. Really adds to the appearance. 
Excellent moutfeel especially given all that maple flavor. Not syrupy at all, lightly carbonated and medium in the mouth. 
I was very happy to have gotten a taste of this given it's limited availabity. Also saw it mentioned that Churchkey kicked it's keg in 12 minutes to I consider myself lucky. Now if I can just find a bottle.... 1,279 charactersisitsavage, Oct 05, 2011

Definitely get a lot of the chocolate and coffee, right up front. The maple syrup is a bit more subtle; took a lot more warming to pick up more clearly. It was noticeable in taking a bit of the edge off the finish of the ale. Over all extremely nice. The smell has a dark fruit and bitter chocolate aroma that is heavy. The alcohol picks up a bit as the brew warms, its absolutely a warmer. Wow this is really a big puncher of chocolate and syrup as the brew gains some temp and matures. Overall amazing! 624 charactersHOPPYKC, Oct 05, 2011

T: Perfectly balanced combination of coffee, bourbon, maple and oak. Coffee arouses the senses, bourbon massages the brain and the maple provides a dessert finish. Perfectly balanced beer.
M: Not too syrupy. Low carbonation.

S: Wonderful sweet bourbon aroma, followed closely by rich chocolate and a hint of roast/coffee. Slight alcohol in aroma.
T: Taste sweet chocalatey bourbon goodness. Roast intertwined perfectly with sweet maple hints, wood, and bourbon. Complex notes of roast coffee lingers after you swallow. Alcohol helps cut through sweetness and the sweetness helps balance out the roast and minimizes any alcohol burn. Incredible!
M: Not as viscous as you would think/expect, and the beer benefits from this given the depth of flavor and complexities. You could finish a few glasses or a bottle of this for this very reason. Low carbonation - perfect.
O: Amazing beer, deservedly hyped and incredibly balanced - especially given the bold nature of ingredients used and flavor profile! One of the best beers I've ever had. 933 charactersbulldogp04, Oct 03, 2011
4.83/5  rDev +4.3%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5CBS release 10/1/2011. Cold night, perfect day.
Black beer, solid but short tan head.
Like KBS, CBS smells like Kahlua. Cocoa liqueur. The sweet malts and the bourbon meld together.
Very rich taste. Strong sweetness with a subtle liqueur edge. But as you drink it, you realize it's more complex than the initial sip. Less vanilla than KBS. Coffee is there but it's deep and not obvious. I didn't detect a distinct maple taste, but I would say it is slightly sweeter than KBS--like a rich molasses has been added. Perfectly drinkable. Great as it warms. 
Certainly deserves its place among the best. 602 charactersbirderbeerer, Oct 03, 2011
4.95/5  rDev +6.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Enjoyed in a snifter on tap at the 2011 bottle release event on October 1, 2011 at Founders. Reviewer allowed the beer to reach near-room temperature. Pours a deep black with virtually no head save for a few bubbles of creamy brown. A slight stickiness allowed CBS to gently coat the sides of the glass with a mild yellowish film. The aroma wafts up easily and little effort is required to discern the moderate bourbon notes. Inhaling a bit more brings forth a hint of something sweeter lingering in wait; possibly the maple syrup or wood. Initial taste jumps forward with dark roasty malts covered in a bourbon shell with a mildly sweet maple syrup finish. The aroma while drinking brings the coffee into subtle play. Subsequent tastes confirm that the alcohol is noticeable, but not overtly present. There are thicker stouts, but the extra weight here would feel out of place. Instead an exceptional balance of the flavors, alcohol warmth, and trailing finish ensure that this beer can be sipped slowly for a long while. 1,022 charactersdarienm, Oct 03, 2011

Coffee in the background. The taste was so well balanced. The maple really cuts the bourbon and the beer benefits from it; though, I did not think the maple came through as strongly as some had told me it would. There was a definite sweetness and it had a maple character to it but the flavors were perfectly balanced. The beer's ingredients live in harmony. No fighting for first position. Very similar to KBS but a notch above. Booze is hidden. Had two and a half glasses. Could have easily drunk more but was driving an hour. Well done Founders. 665 charactersBowman2001, Oct 03, 2011

All of the aforementioned items are present. This was my first maple imperial stout, and I enjoyed it. The maple wasn't too prominent, but it mellowed the flavors of the wood and whiskey nicely.

Appearance is black with a thin tan head...looks good. I take a whiff of CBS and I note vanilla, maple syrup, roasted malts and chocolate. Its` taste has coffee, more chocolate, a little maple syrup and very tasty in general. No aspect of it is too extreme, the flavors are very well balanced. The body is rich and has a light carbonation level. After hearing quite a bit about this beer, it was great to finally try it.

This beer is so damn good and one of the best stouts that I’ve tried. The maple flavor is absolutely wonderful and blends into the chocolatey stout perfectly. I tried the Founders imperial stout lineup together, and CBS was head and shoulders better than the rest, though I’ve never been a KBS fan, to be honest. The pour is black and thick. It has an awesome dark brown head, not quite Hunahpu dark but close. The aroma is a perfectly meshed combination of barrel and stout flavors. Chocolate and maple are the strongest notes, but coffee, roast, vanilla, bourbon and oak all play significant roles. The taste is pretty much perfectly sweet to complement the stout’s flavors. I had to stop myself from drinking my entire glass in one go. It’s a great beer to sip with its big, round mouthfeel and wonderfully complex interplay of flavors, but it was so delicious that I had to force myself to slow down. The syrup flavor fits with the beer even better than I could have hoped (and to be honest, my hopes weren’t set all that high). It has all of the best flavors of rich, dark maple syrup. It reminds me of a test batch of bourbon barrel-aged maple syrup that I tried at the S. Burlington farmer’s market. I found out recently that Founders will be bottling this stuff and I absolute can not wait for another round. Thank you to Founders. 1,444 characterspopery, Aug 15, 2011

Take a bouquet of dark caramel, light roast, pinch of vanilla, a bit of herbal bitter, floral notes, some oak with a hint of booze, add bitter chocolate and just a wee scent of expresso and, well, square it, and you'll get this perfume.
A taste beyond description. The creamy mouthfeel interconnects here, all the flavors of the nose are represented with just a hint of maple, in a balance that is perfect, and the mouthfeel frames them in a way that allows them to shine like no other stout I've tried. I wanted to go perfect score here, but rounded down, as nose was rounded up.
Mouthfeel also borders on being beyond improvement. A hint more maple here, and a touch more bitter in finish might be even better, but perhaps this is perfect?
The best I've tried. Certainly worth the effort to taste, but come on, let's get this bottled and on shelf! 1,066 characterscavedave, Aug 12, 2011

A- Pretty much pitch black, maybe a touch of brownish color. Mocha colored head tight head, with light lacing.
S- Rich chocolate, coffee, and some sweet booziness. I get some roasted malt, coffee, and oak as well.
T- Smooth initial flavor which transitions to a sweeter bourbony flavor. Chocolate coffee and malt again, with some hints of oak flavor. The maple is really that prevalent, but comes through as sweetness and adds some body. Very very nice.
M- Pretty darn good. It could be a little bit thicker, but the body on this is better than KBS. Carbonation is spot on, and the mouthfeel is very nice.
O- This one of the better barrel aged stouts around. While it's not my favorite, it's definitely in the top 10. I've been kind of losing interest in KBS lately, but this beer I could drink year round.

Served with a 1 finger creamy dark mocha head with moderate retention. Beer is an opaque pitch black. Lacing is stringy and web-like with good cling. Above average for the head and lace. 
Nose is heavy on the roasted malt and maple. Dark chocolate, espresso bean, and wet wood linger in the back, providing a nice combination. Robust and deep overall.
Beer opens chocolate, maple and roasted malt. Dark chocolate provides a nice bittering balance with espresso flavors coming in towards the middle. Heavy maple syrup at the end with a sweet coffee and maple aftertaste. Not the greatest complexity but this one definitely delivers on the flavor profile promised. 
Medium to full bodied with moderate carbonation. Smooth and silky in the mouth and warm going down. Messy finish with a pleasant, lingering aftertaste. Really drinkable. 
Overall, there's a bit of disappointment after chasing this one for so long. Its a very solid beer but certainly not up there as one of the most memorable imperial stouts I've ever had. I'm a huge fan of maple infused stouts though and this one's a great example of that if anything. 1,278 charactersSpeedwayJim, Aug 11, 2011
4.18/5  rDev -9.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4So fortunate to try this beer @ decicco's, 8 oz. pour. Black, this beer is black, period. Half a finger of coffee colored tan head that vanishes as fast as I notice it. Speckles do cling to the snifter as I consume. Aroma - vanilla, chocolate, some alcohol is apparent in the nose. Licorice, but little and a tid bit of maple. The flavor is rich and filled with vanilla and chocolate notes, brown sugar, nice oak-y goodness, maple yes I can detect hints of it as well but a more un-refined variety. As the beer warms it takes on depth of flavor with some bourbon and brandy like quality. 
The mouthfeel is somewhat thin and somewhat hot. It does have a dryish finish however and is not all that cloying. A great beer perhaps but not as great as it is rare; like many rare beers sadly. Still to say I am not psyched to have tried this would be a lie. 849 characterspmlondrigan, Aug 11, 2011

4.5/5  rDev -2.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Growler fill. Pours a dark brown/black with a small beige head (combination of the growler and too cold at the time of pouring).
The aroma is very similar to the regular Breakfast stout with the addition of the maple syrup sweetness. Mostly coffee, roast, and a touch of dark fruit. 
The flavor was everything that I have enjoyed in the regular Breakfast stout: Coffee, dark chocolate, and roast with the added dimension of the maple syrup sweetness. 
Cold the body seemed a bit thin. As the beer warmed, the body came around (although not as full as I would like) but remained creamy smooth to drink. The alcohol was not a major factor until it warmed significantly.
I had this at DLD, but my brain and palate were pretty much shot by the time it came out. This was a nice surprise to find so close to home. I have and continue to enjoy this one (at least for a few more sips). 882 charactersajsdad06, Jul 18, 2011

A. Black with a coffee colored head that lasted for a long time.

T. Amazing taste. Chocolate, but on the sweet side not bitter, coffee and muted bourbon. 
M. Medium level creamy carbonation. Slightly thinner than I expected.
O. Very drinkable. It was not heavy at all and it did go down really easy. I would not have stopped at one. Or two. Or three. But... I was forced to.

Pours a thick, viscous black color with a fluffy browned head. Retains throughout the entire pour and leaves sticky lacing everywhere. 
Thick scents of maple syrup, sticky sweetness, bourbon and oak with chocolate and nuttyness. Some hints of coffee with roasted beans and heavy malt. 
Massive flavors right up front with bourbon and boozy warmth. Roasted malts with a substantial amount of coffee and dark chocolate, some cocoa powder and a decent amount of sweetness. Vanilla and oaky tannins, some cake and decadent rich flavors. Finishes with warm booze and syrup which wraps around the tongue. 
Full bodied, milder carbonation, thick syrupy consistency, soft and smooth on the tongue. Absolutely delicious from top to bottom, although I think I prefer KBS. 798 charactersxnicknj, Jun 07, 2011
4.52/5  rDev -2.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Had this at the Rattle N Hum Founders takeover event. May 24th
A: Opaque black with little to no head that had a tan color head No signs of carbonation. Looked like most other great looking stouts that I have tasted before.
S: Smell of strong, sweet maple syrup right up front. Throw in nice mix of chocolate, hints of coffee and a small amount of vanilla thrown in. Made me want to drink this immediately!
T: The first taste that strongly came through to me was the great tasting syrup. A nice malty mix that followed with hints of a very delicious chocolate backwash. A few more sips I can maybe pick up the Vanilla which reminded me of Bourbon County Vanilla. At around 9%, the alcoholic content was very well hidden. Overall I'd say this taste was a little bit disappointing to the hype, but very delicious nonetheless. If they would bottle this and priced it moderately it would be well worth it. The 12 dollar price for an 8oz sized serving was a bit much.
M&O: The mouthfeel is what surprised me the most. It was very very creamy and medium bodied. It went down so smooth and it was the epitome of what I would look for in mouthfeel! Overall I would recommend this beer to everyone, to at least try once even if the price tag is quite high. 1,251 charactersNYManc, May 26, 2011
4.54/5  rDev -1.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5On tap at GI Clybourn during Rare Stout Night, 25 May 2011. Four ounces in a taster.
This pours deep, viscous black with a small tan head rising up and falling away into just a bit of film with some slight lace sticking around. On the nose, there are mostly equal proportions of bourbon, toasted oats, dark chocolate, coffee, vanilla, and oak, with the maple syrup riding underneath it all. I was surprised that the maple was so subdued and the bourbon so prominent, as I would have expected it to be the opposite. It's a phenomenal nose. In the mouth the base beer comes out a bit more, the dark cocoa, fresh roasted coffee beans, and toasted oats providing the backbone for vanilla, oak, bourbon, and maple to play with. They've taken a great base beer, whatever it is, and aged it in barrels such that the barrel flavors mix and compliment rather than overpower. Again, I was surprised at the maple being more subtle that super sweet. The body is big but not humongous, though the finish is super long with the alcoholic heat dying away last.
Overall, this is a nice counterpart to KBS. To me, they're pretty close in flavor, with one notable addition here. Both of these beers are perfect examples of how barrel aging can take a great beer and make it better, rather than take a great beer and tack flavors on. Everything here is very well integrated. Can't wait for this to hit bottles, and glad I had the opportunity to try it.
EDIT - Had this again as part of our local group's Founders beer brunch including this, KBS, FBS, FIS, and the BLiS syrup used to age this one. KBS was the slight winner for me but this was excellent as well. 1,645 charactersEricCioe, May 26, 2011
4.77/5  rDev +3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Wow— the famous CBS. On-tap at Rattle n Hum's Founders Event.
Served in a wine glass.
Completely dark and muddy in color with tan-colored head of approximately one-fingered breadth. Stringy and spotted lacing on interior. On the nose is preliminarily dark-chocolate dominated with great amounts of butterscotch/caramel, vanilla and the maple syrup. Small amounts of alcohol towards the end. As you let the glass warms, the complexity of the stout becomes more evident. Sweetness of the maple syrup becomes extracted further and enhances the experience even more. An amazing smelling beer.
Taste begins with an awesome toasted malt complex, which immediately eases into a phase of smooth and buttery caramel and vanilla essence. Favorite part of the flavor profile, in my opinion; reminds me of an '08 vintage of GI BCS. Experience ends on immense decadence of dark chocolate bitterness and milk chocolate creaminess. Like the smell, complexity arises upon continuous warmth. No alcoholic booziness either. One of the best tasting stouts for sure. Mouthfeel is full-bodied and creamy – just right for this stout.
So privileged to finally try this much elusive beer. Worth the hype, but not sure if the $12/8 oz. tag was justifiable. Nonetheless, the stout was incredibly tasty. Huge thanks for the RnH family and Founders for making this happen for me and other BA's. 1,374 charactersinfi, May 25, 2011

S: There are moderate aromas of bourbon in the nose along with some notes of oak.
T: The taste is very well balanced between flavors of bourbon, chocolate and roasted malts. The maple barrel aging contributes a slight amount of sweetness.
M: It feels full-bodied and very smooth on the palate with a moderate amount of carbonation. Warming from the alcohol is present in the finish.
O: The beer is extremely easy to drink considering its strength because the alcohol is well hidden from the taste. 660 charactersmetter98, May 25, 2011

A: It pours the color of midnight oil, completely opaque. There is a strong one finger tan head that displays excellent retention. It coats the sides if the glass in really impressive sticky lacing. 
S: The sweetness is really out front accompanied by notes of chocolate and coffee. The bourbon is noticeable but comes off more subtle overall. 
T: This beer is full of dark sugary flavors; maple, coffee, chocolate, vanilla, touch of anise, bourbon, and burnt caramel. Sadly, in the end, it finishes a bit too sweet for my liking. 
M: It is medium to full bodied with low carbonation. 
O: Good beer, but after all the hype it has received I expected to be knocked flat on the floor. The lingering sweetness knocks this one down a bit for me. It would be interesting to see how it would age in a bottle. 853 charactersNeffbeer, May 24, 2011

Aroma and taste are big coffee, with chocolate, a roasty quality from the coffee and bourbon characteristics - I found very little in the way of maple. Honestly, I didn't find it all that dissimilar from KBS. CBS is mellower and sweeter.
It's a very good beer for sure. But it's similar enough to KBS in my opinion that it's not worth the hype to hunt down CBS. Now with that said, I'll probably be the first one running to the store if it's ever bottled. Sigh. 563 charactersMavajo, May 21, 2011

A- pours dark black with a decent khaki chocolate head that fades to a nice ring of lacing. Dark red shades outline the glass as light penetrates.
S- smells of sweet bourbon coffee. A slight oaky vanilla comes through. 
T- taste is fantastic. You taste the coffee chocolate base followed by the sweet maple and vanilla bourbon flavors. Alcohol definitely comes through but is welcomed within the complexity of the flavors.
M- mouthfeel is medium. A little lighter and smoother than KBS. Alcohol is secondary to the flavor profile

4.77/5  rDev +3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5This was a top want of mine, and after missing it at Teresa's two years back, I managed to miss it three other times by mere minutes. I wasn't taking any chances this time, and arrived at the Tavern on Liberty in time to get Ticket #6. Friggin sweet! Once it was poured, I let the beer sit for about 20 mins to warm before getting down to work...
This gem comes to me, a coal-like black body below a light brown creamy fluffy cap. Around the edges, rich garnet and ruby hues manifest themselves as highlights against a deep backdrop. This relatively high-gravity brew leaves irregular wisps of lacing on the glass as its level diminishes.
The aroma has really opened up in the 20 minutes that I waited. When it came to me, it was chocolatey. Now, with some warmth and some contact with the air, this bouquet has blossomed to reveal maple syrup, bourbon and the vanilla that it brought along for the ride, along with toffee, caramel, warm alcohol, and the coffee base of the FBS.
The palate is equally impressive, if not more so. Again, the extremely balanced maple bourbon character imparted by those barrels is a focal point. Founders really has these mastered. The maple is the initial impression, though the bourbon and vanilla follow close behind. The vanilla in the flavor is far more prominent than I could pull out in the nose. The complexity of the beer barrels notwithstanding is also more developed on the palate. Coffee, roast, and the toffee/caramel are still present, but tobacco and some dark fruits - dates especially - come to the party, too. Oak and more vanilla round this out. Wow.
Creamy and smooth on the palate, never giving a hint of alcohol on the palate. This artfully crafted beverage gives an all-over warmth to the lucky consumer, and leaves him thirsting for more. I can't wait until the next CBS tapping. 1,838 charactersNittanyBeerFan, May 12, 2011

4.33/5  rDev -6.5%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Reviewed from Notes at Armsby Abbey Stoutfest 4/16/11:
11oz pour from tap:
A: Pitch black, almost 2 fingers of frothy mocha brown head that maintains for quite a while. 
S: Lots of bourbon and coffee with maple, chocolate, and wood aroma in behind. 
T: The first few sips I had were with a good bit of the head, it was extremely creamy and silky smooth with a ton of maple. Getting passed the head, I got the bourbon with coffee and vanilla first with tons of maple syrup and some chocolate behind it. Oak tannins and roasted malts came into play in the middle. Finish was a bourbon, coffee, and maple, a touch boozy. I honestly felt that this was a bit too sweet and boozier than KBS, despite the lower ABV. I felt the maple and bourbon stole a bit too much of the show. Still a great beer, but I was expecting a little more with the hype.
M: While it's thick and smooth, I felt it wasn't quite as viscous or smooth as KBS, surprising as I figured the added sweetness would lend a smooth, luscious mouthfeel, but it didn't (compared to KBS).
O: This is a really great bourbon barrel aged stout, but I actually preferred both the '10 and '11 KBS. A little too sweet, too much maple, not as much depth as the KBS (call me crazy, but that's what I felt), and a little too boozy. If you have the opportunity to try this, of course do so, but don't necessarily expect it to be the most amazing thing ever or way better than KBS. 1,430 charactersSatchboogie, Apr 18, 2011

A- Pours a viscous, oily black from the tap at Founders with very little mocha colored head that disappears almost immediately. As dark as beers get. Beautiful lacing.
S- First whiff is sweet maple bourbon and vanilla. The most amazing thing I've ever smelled. They need to make little CBS air fresheners. Let it warm up and picked up faint chocolate and coffee notes mixed in with a stronger sweet maple character. Fantastic.
T- Slight heat from the bourbon up front, but it's immediately followed by the perfectly balanced sweetness of the maple syrup. The flavors meld so perfectly together, it's hard to really pick out everything going on in this beer. Chocolate, oaky vanilla and a hint of coffee also come through once I let the glass warm.
M- Smooth and creamy with a perfect amount of carbonation. Spot on for the style.
O- Hard to really put this beer into words. At its simplest, it tastes like KBS with maple syrup added, but it's much more complex than that. The bourbon and the maple syrup coexist beautifully together and I could easily drink this all day, every day. A beer that honestly and truly lives up to the infamous status that surrounds it. Believe the hype. 1,258 charactersJoshVandy, Apr 17, 2011

Ticket #69 so I knew it would be a good night. By the time it made its way to my table the head had dissipated to a thin, light brown ring around the edge of a pool of blackness. No light penetrating this bad boy. Aroma of dark chocolate, vanilla, coffee, maple syrup and whiskey is marred only by the cloud of cigarette smoke I am sitting in. I honestly wanted to take my beer and drink it outside. But this is the price I pay for the oportunity to taste this gem. Taste matches the aroma with sweet maple syrup taking more of a supporting role than I expected but just enough to balance the bitter dark chocolate and bourbon warmth. The complexity of flavors go beyond my ability to describe all of them but my overall impression is that this is as good if not better than KBS and I would not hesitate to seek it out again in the future. Thanks to Liberty Tavern for holding this event and Chris for the heads up. 1,023 characterspaulys55, Apr 06, 2011

A: Pours jet black all the way through with no head by the time I was served, but can't count that against the beer itself. 
S: Bourbon, soy sauce, and bitter roasted coffee, followed by maple syrup replacing the soy sauce scent as it warmed up a bit.
T: Initially, I'm only getting soy sauce, the distinctive flavor that reminded me of SA Triple Bock for the first 15-20 minutes until I let it warm up. Finally, after trying a couple other tasters, I got what I expected: big malty bourbon notes, followed by a balanced bitter coffee, and sweet maple syrup/brown sugar on the finish. 
M: Viscous, but not cloying, on the lighter side for the carbonation, and full bodied.
O: Thick and viscous, I think one taster was probably enough for me anyway. I'm sure I could have enjoyed a 10 oz snifter, but that would be it for a beer of such a style. It just wasn't that drinkable, even compared to the KBS a little bit later. Also, the alcohol burn wasn't there at all in this or the KBS but it was prominent in the Imperial Stout. 1,116 charactersstimulus, Apr 01, 2011

A - much like regular BS and KBS; black as an Upper Peninsula forest in the middle of the night; thin hazelnut-colored head, dissipates quickly. 
S - a lot sweeter than BS/KBS, with maple nudging out coffee or chocolate notes.
T - roasty and sweet, but with much less body than I expected. Maple doesn't hang around -- in fact, hardly makes an appearance on the palate. 
M - falls much shorter than a Speedway or Bourbon County Brand Stout. kept trying to let it redeem itself, but i'm afraid the best the CBS has to offer is on the nose.

T - I don't actually find the taste on this nearly as good as the nose. The maple is pretty pronounced, but it tastes a bit thin. Some coffee, a bit of chocolate, it's not bad, but I find it overly sweet, and slightly one dimensional, with the maple coming way too much to the forefront and blowing the rest of the flavors out of the water. It's good, but not great.
M - Thick, syrupy (fitting), lighter side of full bodied, not particularly carbonated. Somehow it manages to feel just slightly thin when it's going through the mouth.

With apologies to regular Breakfast Stout, this is what breakfast should smell like: chocolate chip pancakes with maple syrup and a pot of coffee. All that's missing is a side of bacon. Flavors are nicely integrated, with only a surprising bitterness and strong coffee disrupting the general smooth, sweet flow. Just enough roast to keep sweetness, maple and otherwise, in check. Medium-thick and pretty smooth. Good stuff. 550 charactersPDXHops, Mar 01, 2011

They are both near perfect. Both just lack a bit of complexity through the finish. However, I'm not sure CBS is any better or different than KBS. Perhaps a bit of fresh maple in there, but not much else noticed. Like KBS, a near perfect stout that is only enhanced by the coffee and whiskey barrels. Viscous pour, silky espresso head. Huge flavors, very well balanced. Full creamy body. 489 charactersrye726, Feb 21, 2011

A-pours a jet black viscous liquid with a thick creamy light brown head.
S-the nose is light, there is a fair bit of bourbon up front with some scorched wood as well. Notes of maple, vanilla, and hints of chocolate cake batter sweeten this beer up a little as lots of roasted coffee comes through in the back.
T-the flavor is bold and balanced, the bourbon and wood hits first subtly on the front of the tongue. the maple syrupy and rich vanilla add a nice balance and transition into the breakfast stout that was aged in the barrel. integrated roasted malts, burnt coffe and rich chocolate cake batter in the finish.
M-this is robust and full bodied, very rich and decadent with a soft carbonation holding the large body up just right with a very creamy feel to it.
D-this is a huge beer but very well balanced as the flavors integrate in cooperation. it is rich and tasty but has a complex barrel aging component to add complexity. well done stuff!
Go Steelers! 1,064 characterscpetrone84, Jan 21, 2011
4.73/5  rDev +2.2%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I had this at the Founders tasting at Big Hunt in DC in November 2010. Canadian Breakfast Stout (CBS) was pretty much completely black and maintained an excellent laced head. The smell was a mixture of roasted malts and whiskey; it smelled a lot like Irish coffee. The wood aroma was noticeable too. The taste was malty and delicious, with noticeable sweet coffee. There was some bitterness in the middle with a tiny amount of smokiness. The aftertaste was very smooth with the main flavours being sweetness and the whiskey. This is a very full bodied brew (thick, foamy, creamy) and when coupled with the bourbon flavour, it made CBS seem very... intoxicating. Delicious. I wanted more than the two glasses I had. 714 charactersvandemonian, Jan 21, 2011
4.72/5  rDev +1.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Had on tap at Ashleys in A2 during their Founders night
A: Very dark and opaque. Little head at all, though a good amount of lacing as it went down. Small amount of carbonation bubbles. 
S: Mainly coffee with some vanilla, caramel, and maple. Good smell, but not overpowering.
T: Unbelievable is the only way to describe it--coffee, chocolate, vanilla, maple, caramel. Quite sweet and ever so delicious.

4.76/5  rDev +2.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Edited 10/19/11: On tap at Big Hunt in DC twice in 2009 and 2011. Pours pitch black with a big, super thick tan head that recedes slowly to a small cap and leaves lots of lacing along the sides. The aroma is stunning. This big coffee aroma, bourbon, and dark roasted malts from the underlying beer is still dominant, but the reason it's world class is the maple syrup sweetness. The Breakfast Stout is still easy to pick out with the heavily toasted dark malts and freshly ground coffee. But the maple syrup and bourbon takes over midway through the taste and leaves a lingering sweetness after each sip. The mouthfeel is as smooth as any beer I've ever tasted in this particular FBS category with soft but noticeable carbonation. It's not full bodied, but close. Something about the maple syrup seems to balance the coffee perfectly. This is my favorite BS in addition to KBS. 877 charactersCuriousMonk, Jan 14, 2011
4.77/5  rDev +3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Poured on tap at the recent Founder's event at Haymarket. Reviewed from notes
A: Dark, dark brown in color, though not quite black. There was a 1 finger mocha head on my beer. The head had excellent retention, and left excellent lacing.
S: The main notes I got where vanilla, maple, a little cappuccino, and a little earthiness.
T: The taste was a little more roasty than I had anticipated, but not anywhere near that of a porter. I agree with those that say the maple has faded somewhat, as I remember there being more maple when I had this beer at the Founder's Black Party back in April or so. There was also nice flavors of oats, and vanilla. Overall the taste was smooth, balanced, and terrific. Better than KBS in my opinion
M: The beer had an appropriately medium-low level of carbonation, a nice viscosity, and a great oat aftertaste.
D: One of the most drinkable beers I have had that is over 10%. There was no noticeable alcohol, and every sip left me wanting more. I polished of two 4 ounce servings in about 20 minutes and wish I could have gotten more. 1,070 charactersglazeman, Jan 11, 2011

8 oz pour into small tasting glass.
Appearance: Black with dark brown head. less than 1 finger head that is short lived.
Smell: Oh boy, this smells great!!! Maple, coffee, and chocolate.
Taste: Maple sweetness right away(no cloying sweetness either, just the right amount) that gives way to roasty coffee. Also, has faint flavors of vanilla, oak, honey, and maybe some bourbon sweetness without any alcohol burn. Ends with more coffee and maple flavor tasting more integrated after several sips.
Mouthfeel: Full bodied. Carbonation is perfect. Smooth, absolutely no alcohol burn at all! Silky and sexy!!!
Drinkability: As if the taste wasn't amazing...the mouthfeel is great as well. Easy to drink alot of this beer. U would not think that its only around 9.5%! 
Overall: FOUNDER'S please bottle this beer! No dissapointment here, it was well worth the wait! I would drive all the way to Grand Rapids for a pint of this beer at the tap room! This beer is better than KBS, but KBS is a solid beer that I love as well; one of my other favorite beers.
Went to the Founders CBS Release on 10/01/2011. All I got to say is I have been anticipating Fresh CBS since I tried it at the Haymarket!
poured into snifter by founders brew pub staff! 
Appearance: 4.0 Dark black beer minmal head just a ring around the top of the beer.
Smell: 4.75 Smells like roasty malts, coffee, and bourbon. Its making my mouth water!
Taste: 4.5 Very sweet and roasty. Lots of expresso notes and bourbon. Subtle wood / barrel notes in the background and the expresso/bourbon combonation is a "one two punch" that dominates! This dark beer is very robust! Nice! This beer really becomes great when it warms up to room temp; It becomes a bit sweeter and you start to get the maple syrup in the finish and aftertaste. Not really very boozey either! I am impressed with this since its fresh!
Mouthfeel: 4.5 High end of a moderate bodied beer. Low carbonation levels. Chewy and viscous. Its done well. 
Overall:4.5 Nice and complex just like I remembered! This beer will age nicely! I will always seek this beer out. One of my favorites fresh or aged! I liked it a little better when its was aged. But Fresh is still world class beer! Founders always brings it! 2,405 characters4DAloveofSTOUT, Jan 06, 2011

Appearance- Dark black with a finger of tan head. Good lacing.
Aroma- Sweet sugar, roasted malt, a touch of oak.
Taste- Vanilla from the oak, deep chocolate malt flavor, a hint of bitterness at the end. Mainly sweet taste overall but the maple here has faded with time.
Mouth- Nice full and creamy feel. Good carbonation.

That place is gonna make it big. I've got a feeling... Anyways, CBS is a brew I've wanted to try for quite sometime now. I knew it would happen eventually - my 8 oz. tonight were consumed from a small tasting glass at perfect temperature. 
CBS looks very similar to KBS, but with a lighter, less fluffy head. The foam was more of a tan/off white as opposed to the brown of KBS - there was a half finger head that didn't stick around too long. The smell of CBS is what sets it most apart from FBS, KBS, and other excellent stouts. I get fresh coffee, brown sugar, vanilla, chocolate, maple syrup, and honey in the nose - seriously. Wow. The taste is fresh roasted coffee up front with maple and honey in the middle, rounded off with some bitter roasts in the finish. Drinkability is out of this world. No EtOH burn, not too sweet, not too bitter. I could easily drink 24 oz. or more. 1,008 charactersairohead2001, Jan 06, 2011

Poured a dark black with a small head, not a lot of carbonation with this one, but it did produce a lovely brown head that retained and laced extremely well. Sweet nose with hints of maple syrup, caramel, and some oak. Many of same notes as KBS, with chocolate, oak, hazelnut, and cherry-vanilla, very well balanced. The feel was silk like, very smooth and was easy drinking even though there was a medium to full body with this one, the alcohol is also hidden very well. Overall an outstanding beer, but if had the choice I would choose KBS 597 charactersbonbini26, Dec 30, 2010

Aroma of bourbon and sticky sweet roasted malt. Flavor of bourbon up front and lots of sweetness. Much sweeter than the KBS which must be due to the maple but I don't actually taste the maple sugar specifically, just a general sweetness. The bourbon also stands out more to me in this one. I had high hopes for this one and thought it would be better than KBS but it wasn't for me. 461 charactersLilBeerDoctor, Dec 24, 2010
5/5  rDev +8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Served in an oversized Brandy snifter at the Founders Brewery. From notes from August 2010.
A: Black: Like space without the stars*
S: chocolate, dark fruit, maple syrup
T: Amazing. woody overtones, with the traditional Breakfast stout complex combo of perfect parts coffee, chocolate, caramel, toffee, and chocolate covered fruit, but with a mellowed out boozey maple syrup liqueur almost back. Where it excels more than any other beer I've had is in the balance of all the flavors. It truly is the perfect stout. The 6-8 months spent in maple syrup soaked bourbon barrels really added an amazing touch flavor, changing the whole beer.
M: full bodied
D: I'll say I could drink it all night - and I could - but it'd just be an early night.
This is by far the best beer I've ever had that was so closely watched- constantly under a microscope. It exceeded all my expectations. Beg, Barter, or Steal (not really) for this bad boy because everyone should experience it.

Like stated, poured from a 12oz dark bottle with no label. Pours a pitch black, pretty thick looking at first glance as well. Absolutely no head rises for the first 3/4 of the bottle, so I swirled and poured the rest a bit more aggressively. Now a very nice size brown head rises...very frothy, and has excellent retention! Even leaves VERY sticky patchy lacing all around the glass. An ideal looking stout!
Aroma at first is malty, roasty, and ironically...a tad hoppy. Then I let it sit for a few minutes. Now its awesome! Loads of sweet maple syrup and chocolate.
Flavor...WOW. Out of this world. This beer did not disappoint! Great thick chewy mouthfeel, chocolate, toasted malts, and thick sweet maple syrup! I'm not sure if this is so chunky due to it being bottled...but it's a little unusual. Regardless, it doesn't scare me away. Thick, low carbonation, chewy, malty, sweet, lightly boozy mouthfeel. Delicious! This needs to get bottled more often! 1,049 charactersShadesOfGray, Dec 12, 2010

looks sinny in the glass. I know it's wrong! But I must have the juice! Black, low carbonation. Gorgeous.
I hate being poured a cold stout. This shit shoulda been in a cask. Oh, who am I to bitch and moan!? First aromas of coffee, wood, roasted malts. I sip, I laugh. It is beautiful! Full of rich coffee and chocolate. Sweet and roasty.
Eventually it warms. Brouwers is so beautiful with tables and tables of full glasses of beer warming. It is our warmth and mirth that elevates the temperature of the beer. The maple becomes gigantic, with vanilla and wood and coffee jockeying for position. It makes me feel as though I should not be eating pancakes with cold syrup. Heat, man! Heat!
Gorgeous, gorgeous. I only had one and split with the lady for it was beautiful to behold and I wished for as many people to enjoy it as me. And, of course, it was still kicked by 6.

poured a rich thick viscous black with a very smell dark brown head that disappeared almost immediately. 
the smell when it was first poured and cold was very similar to the KBS but as it warmed up the maple really came out and it was much smoother and less boozy smelling than the KBS. 
cold this tasted very similar to KBS with a little bit more smoothness. as it warmed up the maple flavor really came into play and the entire beer got way more complex, rich and satisfying. very delicious with great subtle coffee and chocolate flavors. 
great thick viscous mouth feel that is very very smooth.
very good drink ability. its so rich that I don't think I could have drank more than the 12oz's of it that I did but a world class beer will absolutely have it again and try and search it out. 936 characterspsiweaver, Dec 03, 2010

Poured a dark black color with just a hint of some off colors at the top next to the dark tan head. Smell is dark chocolate, coffee and some light whisky type aromas. The taste is what just kicks you in the teeth and makes you want more. Mouthfeel coats your tongue awfully thick, and makes you smack your lips. Worth the wait, and wish I had more. 535 charactersgenog, Dec 02, 2010
4.65/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5In a perfect world I would get this on tap in the morning before I went to work. I would put it into mug, just like a cup of coffee. Personally I think this kills Black Biscuit, better than Kentucky Breakfast Stout, but not better than Breakfast Stout. That beer is just delicious. 
The pour on this one is thick, like sludge. It coats the glass with a layer of beer and ruins everything it touches. I accidently got some on my shirt and I had to burn it, no chance of getting that stuff out. No head, kind of disappointing but it was thick. 
Smelled like coffee, chocolate, whisky. These are three of my favorite things. Strong roasted coffee beans, milk chocolate, and a nice strong whisky smell make this a true stunner. 
Just like what was mentioned in the smells, this thing is right up my alley. It doesn't have one character stand out, they all hold hands together perfectly. The whisky is fairly strong, which is what I love in barrel aged beers. The barrel just pushes out the great roasted flavors and sweetness'. 
I want this every morning before I brush my teeth. An amazing beer that I was so happy to finally try.

4.5/5  rDev -2.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5On-tap at Ashley's in Ann Arbor for the Founders event.
Pours a deep black color with a one-finger mocha colored head. Head retention is decent and lacing is very nice for a big stout. Aroma is dark chocolate, burnt malt, and toasty oak with a substantial maple component and a very subtle coffee note. The taste is much smoother than the regular FBS, which is the base beer for CBS. Like the aroma, the taste is led by dark chocolate and deeply toasted malt with considerable toasty oak barrel and moderately sweet maple syrup flavors. The flavors are very well integrated and smooth with a lingering bourbon heat and a much diminished coffee component from FBS. Mouthfeel is full-bodied with moderate-to-low carbonation and a mild lingering alcohol warming. The drinkability is fairly high for the abv. The moderate sweetness balances out the toasty and bitter malt and coffee notes very well, and the complexity is great. Overall, this is a great beer that definitely lives up to the hype. However, after trying KBS and FBS (and Black Biscuit) side-by-side with CBS, I slightly prefer FBS and KBS. Here's to hoping Founders bottles this gem in the near future! 1,164 charactersWeisGuy, Nov 24, 2010

1/4 finger tan head, medium-slow dissipation in small nonic glass with above average lacing. Dark brown/nearly black opaque body, couldn't see any effervescence, even when held up to the (limited Big Hunt) light. Taste is ultra-complex, coffee, some bittersweet chocolate, toffee more than molasses or caramel, with some vanilla from the barrel but I didn't pick up any maple aromas, noble hops. Taste mirrors the nose, with a dry finish due to the oatmeal. The barrel aging certainly tamed the ABV which wasn't very noticeable, decent but not overwhelming effervescence, slight bit of stickiness. Despite relatively high ABV quite drinkable. A high standard in the art of brewing, one of the best beers I've ever had-I came back the next afternoon for another glass! Worth seeking out at all cost, along with Barley Brown's Havoc one of the best AIS I've had. 973 charactersjdense, Nov 22, 2010

Into a tulip glass, it poured black with little visible evidence of carbonation, yet one finger of brown head that retained and laced extremely well. Very sweet nose, with caramel and maple syrup coming to mind, but also many of the essences similar to KBS...chocolate, oak, hazelnut, and cherry-vanilla. The taste was just a tremendously balanced mix of the aforementioned, tilted toward the sweet end of the spectrum, with a maple/caramel/chocolate sweet finish. The feel was like liquid silk; no carbonation and medium to full thickness. This was an excellent beer that went down WAY too easy, with such a well-hidden alcohol content. 770 charactersdonniecuffs, Nov 19, 2010

Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of roasted malt, smoke, wood, molasses, and slight alcohol. The flavor was comprised of sweet malt, roasted malt, coffee, alcohol, and a smokey note on the followthrough. It had a heavy creamy feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this beer blew me away. This might be one of the better Imperial Stouts I've had to date. I loved how the mouthfeel on this one was both heavy and creamy at the same time making is scarely drinkable. This brew had an awesomely well balanced flavor and nice aroma to boot. Seriously, what else could you want in a beer? This is a must try if you have never had it before and if you have and are like me, you want MORE! 846 charactersthagr81us, Nov 15, 2010
4.6/5  rDev -0.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5On tap at Duckworths in Charlotte. Reviewed during the Founders Backstage Beer Dinner. 
Black to the edge with light to medium brown head. Low retention with low-mid lacing. 
Sweet chocolate and vanilla coffee flavors. Hints of maple in the aroma as well.
The flavor is similar to the nose with a much more intense assault on the taste buds. The different aspects of the taste meld together nicely to make for an excellent spectrum of flavors from the beginning to the finish. 
Viscous and silky. Medium to low carbonation.
Sessioning this would be fun...in a kind of sick way. 582 charactersHabmike, Nov 14, 2010

This is aged in bourbon barrels that previously aged maple syrup.
CBS pours a pitch black opaque color with a creamy brown head with good retention.
Smell is wonderful. Chocolate, cream, coffee, maple syrup, vanilla and some booze. Could be a little stronger or maybe it is still too cold.
Taste is way stronger. Dark malts, bitter chocolate, dark fruit, maple syrup and oak/bourbon. Aftertaste is delicious and persistent: chocolate, bourbon, vanilla and then, only then, espresso coffee! I'm amazed at the complexity of this one.
Body is heavy and carbonation is just right: strong enough to boost the drinkability, low enough to let the flavors come thru. Alcohol is noticeable in the end.
One of the best beers I've ever had.
Update: smell got way stronger when this warmed up a bit. Maple notes also became more proeminent. I also saw this beer being poured in a proper glass and it looked way better with persistent head and nice lacing, so my rating is going up in that department. 1,106 characterspaulozanello, Nov 10, 2010

Pours a black color with a caramel colored foam head. Has an aroma of chocolate, coffee, roast, and bourbon. Has a sweet chocolate start, with coffee spice on the back end. A nice velvety chocolate finish. Medium mouthfeel. Despite what the great Damico says, CBS is better than KBS. It is creamier which tempers the abv. You'd think one adverse to boozy beers would agree. 486 characterschalsk, Oct 21, 2010

A: Dark as heck with an extreme amount of brown foam (like I said this was the bottom of the keg). Still very appealing.
S: Oak, chocolate, bourbon and a hint of maple (I thought this would be more prominent in the nose, especially at the bottom of the barrel). Sweet! Pun intended.
T: Not as sweet as other reviews indicate. Roasted coffee, wood, mellow bourbon, and maple syrup which blends in very nicely. Decadent.
M: Silky smooth. I like the mouthfeel and the aroma combined better than the taste. Not thick at all - almost drinks as if it were on nitro.
D: Even after a filling pizza dinner, I thought the ~8oz. I had was very satisfying and not near cloying.
Overall, while Alan J. is away the Tigerites will still obey - respect beer! 863 charactershoppymcgee, Oct 21, 2010
4.02/5  rDev -13.2%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3Had at the Bedford Hts Winking Lizard during Cleveland Beer Week.
Very dark brew, and slightly thicker looking than regular Breakfast Stout. Didn't get much head on my pour other than a few wayward bubbles (dark toffee color) and little lace. This, however, may be partially the fault of the bar. They apparently only had a handful of 10oz glasses (which weren't that great anyways) and started serving the CBS in two wineglasses instead. Ugh, but whatever.
Smell was very different from regular BS. Lots of sweet vanilla. Bourbon also on the nose (smelled strong on alcohol compared to BS). Coffee, but it is very much beaten into submission by the effect of the barrel.
This beer is SUPER sweet. Vanilla up front. I got a lot of maple as well. I was not expecting to taste it, but this must be fresh CBS or something, because it was hard to miss. Some coffee in there, but I started to miss the thick coffee richness from regular BS. There's a dry woodiness to it and an ass-load of bourbon. It's not as overpowering as some BA beers, but, the bourbon does it's share of enhancement to, as well as detractment from the base beer.
CBS is definitely boozy compared to regular BS. Whereas the regular is super smooth and refreshing, this was the opposite in many ways. Medium bodied, so sweet it was nearly unbearable at times (though this got better as the beer warmed). Still smooth, but not as silky as BS. Hot and warming, the mouthfeel is still something to be proud of here, just in a different way than BS.
The drinkability is a tough one for this beer. The rarity makes getting more than a glass or two in a sitting nearly impossible, as well as make one lucky to have this more than a couple times a year (or less). The sheer rarity is enough to make me suck down what I can the next time I find some, but to be honest, it's so sweet and boozy it's not very easy drinking anyways. I prefer Breakfast Stout over CBS (at least for a beer to drink on a regular basis).
I will be getting some KBS Sunday at the end of Cleveland Beer week, thus making the circle nearly complete. I am really hoping KBS is heavier on the coffee and less on the sweetness compared to CBS. 2,179 charactersSpider889, Oct 20, 2010
4.42/5  rDev -4.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Huge thanks to Thirstybird for sharing this one. Served in a tulip. Pours one shade shy of black with a thin, tan-colored head that dissipates into a sudsy swirl around the edges. Nose reveals bourbon, with a trace of maple syrup towards the back. Taste follows nose - not complex, but incredible balance. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a light carbonation - smooth and silky. Incredibly easy drinking. Not at all cloying considering the dominant flavors being bourbon and maple syrup. Having had this at EBF last year, I have to say that there was surprisingly less maple syrup in this one and have to wonder if there might be some variation in vintages. An exceptional American Double/Imperial Stout. 703 charactersJwale73, Oct 17, 2010

A. Dark brown/black with a coffee colored head that forms a wisp of a ring around the top.
S. Bourbon and chocolate with a touch of maple and a tiny bit of coffee.
T. Beautiful - bourbon with sweet chocolate and oatmeal along side a layer of maple syrup. There's a bit of coffee, but not nearly as much as the KBS we tried alongside of it.
Lots more coffee in the bottle than I remember on draft. Nice sweetness on the tail from the maple syrup.
M. Thick body with smooth medium level creamy carbonation.
D. Very drinkable. Not overpowering. I'll be there for a tapping anytime this comes near - truly wonderful. 640 charactersBeerAndBourbon, Oct 15, 2010
4.82/5  rDev +4.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5The beer poured a deep brown/black with a creamy, mocha-colored head that faded to a lasting frothy cap. Thin rings of lacing trickled down the cup.
The aroma was outstanding. Coffee was most noticeable. Freshly brewed, dark roast coffee to be precise. Semi-sweet and smooth with notes of vanilla and oats.
After waiting for a few hours at the Flying Saucer in KCMO I finally got a VERY conservative pour. It's times like this that I wish I were an online beer reviewer with friends in the local beer scene! That dude was topped off more times than I can count!
Coffee, bourbon, roasted grains, chocolate, and MAYBE a hint of maple as it warms.
The taste was very similar to the aroma. Again, coffee dominated. Coffee grounds specifically came to mind. Deep, dark and rich. Bourbony with notes of brown sugar. The finish was woody and oaky. A touch of maple syrup appeared as well. Overall, the flavor profile was similar to KBS, except a bit sweeter.
The mouthfeel was medium/full bodied. Smooth and supple. Creamy, frothy and pillowy.
Drinkability was quite good. This was a tasty, rich and complex brew. The 9.4% ABV was very well masked by the intense flavor profile.
I was really impressed with this beer. Even though the addition of maple syrup did little flavor-wise, it really helped to mellow out the roasty bitterness in this brew. 1,348 charactersbigdonniebrasco, Oct 13, 2010

A Dark Dark Dark, slight lacing that stayed throughout the 6 0z pour
S Coffee and Chocolate from the breakfast stout up front, slight bourbon and maple but not as strong of a bourbon smell as KBS. Brown sugar was picked up on as well.
T&M Oak and Maple mixture up front with syrupy vanilla and coffee notes. Medium body was not what I expected out of this killer stout. Very complex malt flavor as well.
D As good as advertised, the 6 oz pours were enough to get a feel for this highly acclaimed beer. Very drinkable to the point taht it could sneak up on you Would of liked to try it out of a snifter and let it open up a bit, but I wont complain that I had a couple tastes of this.

S - Maple, chocolate, little bit of roastiness. Slight boozy alcohol smells great with a little bit of vanilla and oak.
F/M - Sweet dark molasses, vanilla, chocolate and a little bit of roasty dark malts. Candy-like maple syrupish flavor. Delicious. Medium high bitterness accentuated by the dark malts. Full, sweet, oily, thick and viscous mouthfeel. Moderate CO2. Pleasant warming all the way through. Lingering maple flavor.

Looks, Full stout blackness with a brief tan head that goes away but there is a considerable film+ lacing on the cup.
Aroma Strong coffee as expected from Breakfast Stout as the base. Big roasty stuff and I do sniff maple,though did not get the boubon or oak.
Taste- Big Time ! Leads with a rich and dark coffee and nutty,smoky roasts The Maple and bourbon are there but a bit less upfront than expected. This, nevertheless has such a high level of tasty and OMG,and yum that I kept drinking it a bit too quickly to quite fully explore it's complexity,and it's large on complexity. Breakfast Stout,while enjoyable, was so dominated by the coffee,I did not feel it was quite an elite stout. THIS? the extra steps from those unique barrells add layers of complex mystery and the aging probably also refines this. Nothing in this is less than exceptional.
mouthfeel...well....It's a big stout with oatmeal,maple syrup,bourbon,coffee,chocolate all tossed in so as you'd expect all that stuff adds up to plenty of substance.
drinkability. I had a couple,obviously CBS is not low cost and I'd be lucky to have it once or twice a year. I'd be fine with not operating heavy machinery and getting a ride home if I got to drink these until I flop.
Peanut, the ace bartender at Dilly Deli did me a special 60-40 blend of CBS and Devil Dancer. Whee! The big time WOW of CBS and Dancer's big time hop finish. That was memorable.
Someone called that blend Canadian Lap Dancer,several of us had one and we all loved the stuff. Rare beer geek moment.
John Host from Founders explained to me why CBS will never see bottles. It uses barrells that had Bourbon and then were used to age a Bourbon Barrell Maple Syrup...which is obviously,a very limited production gourmet treat. CBS can only be produced in the quantity the supply of barrels permits,and that's just enough to do this sort of tasting,not even enough to have full kegs sent to all the bars who'd like to have them. 2,049 charactersrembrant, Oct 08, 2010

S: Huge Oak and bourbon aroma right off the bat. Maple and coffee are more subdued, but come out in the finish
T: Beautiful mixture of oak and bourbon. Coffee and a sweet maple/ oak flavor round out the finish. The alcohol is very well hidden and all the flavors meld together into one great beer. There is an almost cloying flavor in the finish.
M: Very smooth. Medium to thick bodied with a nice level of carbonation. You can feel the alcohol on your tongue more than you can taste it. Leaves a slightly slick taste in the finish. 
D: Hells yeah, but not quite as awesome as I would have thought. Mellow, smooth, and delicious. 752 charactersBeejay, Oct 08, 2010

Maple syrup sweetness takes totally awesome KBS flavors, mellows them a bit, and complexifies everything. Such a great idea to age a coffee stout in maple bourbon barrels. Promote the brewer who came up with that.
Not to be missed when available. Bottle it, and the King of The Stouts has arrived. 
I don't know if I rated it higher than KBS, but it's better. But KBS is available in bottles, so that complicates my affections.
edit: just checked. I rated this higher. It appears I know what I'm doing. 545 characterscaskstrength, Oct 01, 2010

served in a tulip glass
A: Dark as night, small mocha head that dissipates quickly leaving minimal lacing.
S: Tremendous nose on this stout. Strong coffee, dark chocolate and a roasty smokiness. The maple syrup is quite fragrant as well and very pleasant.
T: The perfect mix of strong coffee, bitter dark chocolate, and roasty malt with a touch - just a touch - of boozy heat. The maple sugar finish is the cherry on top. I let this one warm for at least a half hour and I was glad I did. So complex all the way through and the maple sugar finish puts a nice tidy bow on the experience. By far the best breakfast stout by Founders, perhaps by any brewery.
M: Medium full body, creamy with a nice little sweet slickness at the end. Carbonation is medium for a stout and fits this beer nicely.
D: Can't wait for more. Scary drinkable. What I love about this beer more so than KBS is there is hints of booziness, but never too powerful or overbearing. The dark malt and sweet maple sugar get to shine within this coffee/chocolate blend.
Bottle this please! 1,093 charactersbwd110, Sep 29, 2010

No light seems to penetrate this beer, and when I swirl it in the glass I can see only traces of light through the dark amber edges. The head slowly settles and leaves average lace on the sides of the tulip glass as I enjoy this beverage.
The aroma is of rich coffee, chocolate, a hint of sweet maple, and sweet roasted malt. This beer smells like no other with a wonderful balance between all the elements. It really smells like a kitchen while someone is making a hearty home cooked breakfast. The only thing missing is bacon.
The flavor is amazing. Tons of coffee, sweet dark malt, light maple sweetness and delicious chocolate. Much less bourbon and booziness than KBS, and very enjoyable. As it warms the maple comes out more, leaving tasty maple sugar on the tongue. I am loving how this beer manages to add onto the flavors of breakfast stout without becoming too much.
The mouthfeel is nice and full. It coats the mouth easily with all its deliciousness. There is a bit if a slippery bitter finish with some roasted coffee astringency. The aftertaste that lingers on the palate is amazing, with plenty of sweet maple sugar.
Very drinkable and enjoyable. It is hard to pace myself because it is so tasty and goes down so easily. Probably the best of the three breakfast stouts that Founders makes. This is a world glass beer all the way and is absolutely recommended. 1,458 characterszoso1967, Sep 25, 2010

S- smells like gram ma's kitchen in the morning. Maple syrup, dark roasted coffee, bakers chocolate. Dark breads. Touches of booze. This smells very good. 
T- opens up with a landslide of coffee and maple syrup. Dark and milk chocolate with some char and super dark malts. Long roasty finish. 
M- full bodied but not thick or chewy. Lite to mid carb that fits the brew nicely. Just a touch of heat. Nice.

Pours a very dark brown, pretty much black, with some brown around the edges. Thick. Two fingers of dense dark tan head forms and lasts for a while, leaving a lot of lacing behind...
Smell was initially like 100% maple syrup. Sweet, molasses. Lots of chocolate and hints of oak and vanilla. Just a bit of roasted bitterness, touch of coffee...
Took a sip and then licked the sludge off of my teeth, it was pure maple syrup. Sweet, bittersweet dark chocolate. Roasty. Very strong oak taste in the finish, as well as a lingering oaky dryness in the aftertaste...Complex and delicious...
Thick and chewy. Sticky. A bit of alcohol warmth after a while...
Dangerously drinkable for such a thick, heavy beer. Incredible. 877 charactershawks10, Sep 24, 2010

Appearance -- Pours a rich dark brown, with a dirty halo of yellow-tan head.
Smell -- Honestly, it smells an awful lot like KBS: Espresso, Bourbon, dark chocolate, faint molasses, vanilla, and a hint of maple sugar. The maple is a lot more subdued than I expected - a good thing.
Taste -- Like KBS, there's lots of chocolate and espresso, burnt/earthy bitterness to balance, faint taste of oatmeal. Bourbon is certainly present, but more mellowed - or is it the slim difference in ABV that makes it seem less sharp than KBS? Anyway, there's also some vanilla notes from the barrel and, of course, maple. The maple is very downplayed, to the beer's benefit.
Mouthfeel -- Smooth, body is pretty full, carbonation is moderate. Solid, but I wouldn't call it 'perfect.'
Drinkability -- Disclaimer: I think KBS is good, but not great. Now that's out of the way, I have to say that I really enjoyed CBS. The sharp bourbon that I dislike in KBS is a lot smoother, more malt sweetness comes through (only 45 IBU's; nearly half that of KBS). The maple is noticable, but not even as pronounced as the chocolate. This beer is very balanced and much more easy-drinking than KBS. Big win for Founder's, and that's saying something! 1,283 charactersyeahnatenelson, Sep 24, 2010

Ta- Very similar to the smell, but the espresso is more pronounced. Still the flavors balance so well it's amazing. Every sip is a different take on the same delicious story.
MF- Nice subtle carbonation that cuts the sweetness beautiful. Not hot at all especially considering the ABV.

Coffee dominant aroma, not quite as strong as the KBS, but this one has more caramel, chocolate and almonds in the background.
Upfront flavor is coffee. Caramel, maple and almond come through in the middle and the end is mostly creamy dark chocolate. Throughout is a soft ripe black plum that provides a bit of a nibble. 
Smooth overall. Feel is a touch light for style, yet at 9.4 it's easy to drink. 464 charactersMebuzzard, Sep 20, 2010

So some of this was left on a sidewalk in Brooklyn, but that said, I was happy to have the experience of drinking it. Had on tap at a distributor event (S.K.I.) at the Blind Tiger Ale House in the West Village. There was a sixtel of it and that thing flowed freely.
Appearance: Solid and thick and dark. Nice initial head and it sustains well too. Great lacing.
Smell: I've had the GI BCS, and thought this might have a similarly overwhelming aroma, except of Canadian Whiskey instead of Bourbon. I was pleasantly surprised, because the aroma was present but not too powerful. The general coffee, chocolately stout smell could still come through.
Mouthfeel: Creamy, rich, and lovely. 
Drinkability: Except for the high abv that prevents it from being a session beer, this is a mighty tasty treat to enjoy fully. 888 charactersafksports, Sep 18, 2010

S&T - very complex, with an amazing series of flavors as one savors a sip. Coffee, oatmeal, bourbon are among main components of taste and aroma. Maple syrup used in aging makes a subtle but significant contribution to this wonderful drink. Long-lasting taste and well-balanced taste components, if a trifle sweet. 
M - full bodied with adequate carbonation. 
This is the best stout/porter I've ever had! I tried Founders KBS at the same time. The taste, balance and complexity of the CBS were clearly superior, but then I am not a fan of bourbon which is a bit more pronounced flavor component in the KBS 655 characterschinchill, Sep 16, 2010

Pours black as sin with a small, tight tan head and somewhat heavy lacing. Smells of rich chocolate and roasted coffee. Take the flavors of KBS, tone down the bourbon booziness, and mellow it out with more vanilla, dark chocolate and some sugary maple. Creamy, almost chewy. Thick. Mouthcoating. 
It seems so simple. Take out some of the hot aspects of KBS by some more barrel aging. The maple helps to round out the harsher notes that usually take longer to smooth in a cellar.

4.0 A: Pitch black color. Came with about one finger of frothy light brown head with average retention and not really any lacing.
5.0 S: Very complex and the balance between the components is incredible. Coffee is the strongest aroma, with sweet maple syrup, bourbon, oakiness and vanilla, and bitter chocolate playing complementary roles.
5.0 T: All the components of the nose are found in the taste. However, the coffee is even stronger and is the focus of the taste. Maple syrup is a bit stronger. The bourbon is in perfect proportions; just enough to make the beer better without dominating. Semi-sweet chocolate and some roasted barley. 
4.5 M: Heavier medium body. Good moderate amount of carbonation. Fairly creamy and super smooth. Could be a bit thicker, but what else could you want in a beer this good.
5.0 D: Excellent beer. I ended up getting 2 pours for myself at the bar and I'm drinking another nearly two pours after my failed attempt at a handbottle trade. I'll put it this way...after nearly 40 oz of CBS today, I would still like another glass. 1,148 charactersDavoleBomb, Sep 13, 2010

S - sweet maple syrup, oak, coffee, and bourbon. good balance between these, with nothing sticking out more noticeably than the last.
T - maple syrup, oak, vanilla sweetness...some slightly bitter coffee is held in check by dark chocolate, and a warming bourbon. very sweet yet balanced...very suitable for breakfast.
M - medium body, maybe a touch thin. strong prickly carbonation but not overdone. falls apart just a bit at the end, could use some heavier body to hoist up the extra dose of sweetness.
D - always a treat to get this one...feel like this year's version but a little weaker than the past, with a thinner mouthfeel and less of the delicious maple syrup flavors making its way through (we got some of the syrup again too, its heavenly). drinkable and hard to find a better way to start the day. 1,091 charactersStigs, Sep 13, 2010

Fast forward a couple of weeks.... I was out beer shopping in downtown DC and came upon a great bookstore and tap house I had always heard great things about, but had never experienced - Kramerbooks. I went inside and the bartender handed me a draft menu and low and behold.... there it was!
A: Very dark, pitch black even, with a great deal of carbonation for a beer this style. It poured with about an inch worth of head. This one's a beauty!
S: Maple and coffee (just like the name dictates), with hints of chocolate and caramel. It had a very candy-like sweetness, as apposed to a brown sugar-type one.
T: Founders BS with maple sweetness. How to describe this best .... Hmmm...Caramelized, coffee and maple infused, dark chocolate cotton candy, melted into liquid form and slightly chilled. Simply amazing!
M: Surprisingly creamy and smooth. Some of the coffee ground notes I found offensive in the BS are now muted, and the high grade maple prevails.

My share was handed to me in a wine glass...my serving appeared to be a few ounces less than what everyone else at our table got, but I was still happy to have a pour of Canadian Breakfast Stout sitting before me.
The beer was very dark brown/black with a thin chocolate brown head. There were notes of bittersweet chocolate, coffee, vanilla, and maple in the nose. Based on the smell, I was expecting the beer to have a very sweet maple flavor, but I was wrong. While the beer was definitely sweet, the maple flavor was very mild and almost non-existent. It became a little more noticeable as the beer warmed. The dominant flavors initially were the chocolate and coffee, along with some roasted malts. Hints of bourbon are also slightly noticeable, but nowhere near the extent of KBS.
Overall, an excellent beer that I would not hesitate to try again. If you have the chance to try this beer, do not miss out! 1,049 charactersratedz, Aug 27, 2010
4.04/5  rDev -12.7%look: 5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Draft at Founders. Dark as ever black/brown with a nice tan head. Notes of chocolate and coffee in the nose. Maple not that present. Very smooth taste. Good but really expected more out of his after hearing about it for so long. I wish I could have said this was the greatest beer I have ever had but I felt let down in the end. The look and mouthfeel were spot on though for me, it just fell a little short in the taste.
Draft at Mackenzies for ABR. Poured a very dark brown color with a reddish tan head that quickly settles to a slight collar. The aroma is more coffee and leather than I remember with slight chocolate aromas as well. Nice coffee taste with dark chocolate bitterness. Again, I really don't pick up major maple flavors at all although it has a pretty malty sweet taste although as it warms but you do get a slight maple aroma as it warms. Medium mouthfeel, wish it was a little heavier. Pretty drinkable. Lingering bitter coffee flavor. 956 characterskbutler1, Aug 19, 2010
4.37/5  rDev -5.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4.5On at in a 10oz glass at Bodega on 8/16/10
Very dark brown; looks all but jet black. A few cola-brown highlights peek through around the edges. Poured about 1/8th inch of hot-chocolate colored foam that skimmed out, leaving ring on the inside. Essentially no retention by the end & only a couple random streaks of lace.
Incredibly smooth & structured aroma. Vanilla, bourbon & maple jump right out. Roasted dark malts are appreciable; molasses, especially & brown sugar. Maybe a spot of dark chocolate. Faint earthy undertones. Doesn't at all smell boozy. The aroma is distinctly maple once warmed.
Tastes far more bold that suggested by the aroma. It has a decent amount of heat. Though not cloying, it is noticeable. Neither does bourbon run rampant; it's nicely seated amid notes of vanilla & wood. Swaths of maple add a layer of complexity. The base stout is solid, too. Roasted malts with a penchant for burnt tones. Molasses, brown sugar & possibly a hint of caramel & toffee. Not overly sweet. Seems to be a mild notion of dry, roast coffee. Slightly bitter toward the finish.
Rather full-bodied with a deep-seated grittiness. Has kind of a coating feel, too. Carbonation is a bit high, in my opinion. There's an effervescent prickliness that doesn't work in the beer's favor. A smoother feel would be ideal. Residuals of the flavor profile linger, as does a mild bitterness.
Drinkability is really impressive considering the magnitude of the beer. I like it much more than KBS; I find it has better integration. Highly recommended if you come across it. Columbus BAs - get it at Bodega while you can. 1,613 charactersRyan011235, Aug 19, 2010
4.81/5  rDev +3.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75A - Extremely dark, almost black in the glass, but some light makes it into the corner of the glass. A very small tan head sits at the surface until the end, leaving a nice lace on the glass for an imperial stout. Looks great, but I've seen some that look much more intimidating. Impressive overall.
S - Sweetness in the form of vanilla and maple syrup, notes of coffee and chocolate, and of course I get a good bit of bourbon. Nowhere near what I smell with KBS, which is a good thing for me, but the alcohol is alive in the aroma here. Extremely pleasant overall.
T - I get a strong maple coffee flavor up front, mixed with some chocolate and fairly notable bourbon flavor (again, nothing close to the bourbon in KBS, so I'm excited for the rest of this one). This is a pretty darn sweet brew, but that didn't stop me from having multiple glasses. I guess I should expect a lot of sweetness in a BS. I preferred this one as it warmed since it was initially served a bit too cold. The flavors really explode and blend nicely to create possibly the best stout I've tasted to date. This brew was somewhat warming, but that doesn't surprise me at all. Taste is off the charts, overall.
M - Not as thick and chewy as I would have guessed (that's a plus), almost thin for an imperial stout, but very smooth. I feel like the carbonation is spot on... There isn't too much at all, which is how I like my heavy stouts.
D - Well I had no issue downing 30 oz. of this delicious beer during happy hour so I'd say it's a heck of a drinkable beer for what it is. You wouldn't want to slam them all night or else you'd probably get sick, and you wallet would be empty (rightfully so). It's a beer that you'll rarely have a chance to try. If you see this on tap, pick up a glass, and don't be hesitant to order another. By the way, I DEFINITELY prefer this to KBS. Much more pleasant and I don't get the liquor and heat that I got from KBS. 1,930 charactersBonis, Aug 17, 2010

Very dense dark black oily pour. Aroma is sweet with some slight maple notes, but this maple aspect comes though much more strongly in the taste. Sweet maple, dark chocolate, vanilla, bourbon, oak, coffee - its all here and more. Simply delicious. SUPER smooth and remarkably easy to drink - this one is dangerous! Will cherish every sip if I ever get to try it again. Fantastic brew. 469 charactersthetomG, Aug 17, 2010
4.5/5  rDev -2.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Had this on tap @ Churchkey. I was third in line waiting, by the time the doors opened there were over 20 people waiting to get inside.
Decanted into a 10oz. snifter from a pint glass as they were having carbonation issues for the first few beers.
This beer is dark black with no discoloration around the edges. Thick creamy head that dissipates fairly quickly to an oil slick coating. For the amount of maple syrup in the aroma I was slightly disappointed in it not following through to the flavor. Body is astonishingly light for the abv and complexity of this stout. Bourbon flavor is enjoyable but off set by the sweetness of the beer. The two pours I was able to get went down way to easily, especially for 10$ a pour. It was pretty unanimous at our table that it was a mellower sweeter KBS, which we were all happy with.
If you know your going to have a chance to drink this, bring pancakes. 900 charactersneorunner, Aug 15, 2010
4.28/5  rDev -7.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4A - Pours near pitch black. No light gets through even in the narrow serving glass. The tan head is just under a finger deep and appears tight and thick. It slowly recedes to a thick cap on the brew. Lacing is plentiful all the way down the glass. Very good job in this department.
S - Aroma is light but still pleasant. Alcohol is present all the way through and has a bourbon type heat to it. Primary aromas are a combination of bittersweet chocolate and milk chocolate. They quickly fade to reveal some roasted and smokey notes. Maple syrup only has a light showing here.
T - Blast of maple immediately hits the palate at first sip. I have to say, it mixes well with the other stout flavors. Lots of roasted malt goodness permeates every aspect of this beer. Alcohol isn't covered as well as in the aroma. It's warm. Very warm. Midway some vanilla comes out. Finishes with heavy charcoal and a little more maple. 
M - Medium bodied with a light and smooth carbonation. The finish starts off sweet and creamy and ends warm.
D - Drinkability is pretty good. Alcohol almost gets in the way but consistently stays just a notch under hot. The flavors come together to make a really tasty libation. I must say though, one pint is probably enough. Any more than that, and I see the maple aspect getting a little cloying. Still a highly recommended brew if you get a chance to try it. 1,383 characterscsmiley, Aug 15, 2010
4.52/5  rDev -2.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Had the pleasure of trying this out on-tap at Bodega tonight.
Canadian Breakfast Stout is a very dark chocolate fudge color. It's damn near onyx and opaque. There are light burgundy highlights at the outermost edges, but it's very dark and ominous. A thin layer of bubbles covered the surface. They're mocha brown and dissipate quickly. Lacing was spotty and light. Perhaps a little too much abv.
The nose is impressive. It kicks off with an excellent mix of roasted coffee and bittersweet dark chocolate. Coffee seems fairly prominent, and it smells all the better for it in my view. Bourbon is noted, but isn't overpowering. Reminds me of KBS in that sense. That's my preferred approach with barrel aged stouts. Ancillary notes of vanilla and oak are present. A touch of maple syrup is noted, and adds quite a bit of character. More than I expected. Alcohol is present. It's big beer. If you're offended, get over it.
I'm really impressed with Canadian Breakfast Stout. I had high expectations and they are met. Roasted coffee or espresso blends with dark, bittersweet chocolate initially. The chocolate malt base is very sturdy (and tasty). Bourbon is definitely in the mix, but definitely has a restrained taste. It's there, but isn't too bold. Good call. It complements the stout flavors very well. Secondary flavors of vanilla, oak, light molasses, and anise are noted. Maple syrup is noted throughout. It has a nice flavor and adds some character. But I don't think it improves it materially. Just my take. Alcohol is noted, but isn't warming or hot. Finishes chocolaty with a touch of bourbon.
Canadian Breakfast Stout has a medium body that leans toward thick with warming. It's nice and smooth. Carbonation is dialed back nicely. It's good, but more body would probably improve it a little. Drinkability is excellent. This is damn tasty stuff. No question. It goes down too easy for a beer of its stature. I'll stop at one glass, but would love another.
I really had high hopes and expectations for Canadian Breakfast Stout. Founders certainly didn't disappoint. This is great beer. Personally, I don't like it quite as much as KBS, but that's just my preference. I don't think the maple flavor adds that much. It's good though, and it certainly doesn't hurt things. More than solid-all around otherwise. If you have the opportunity to get out and try this one, you certainly should. In typical Founders fashion, it's excellent. 2,443 charactersprototypic, Aug 15, 2010

Pours black with a tan head and little lacing or carbonation to this bad boy.
Complex smells of coffee, maple, bourbon, vanilla, chocolate. Very intriguing and great smell.
Great taste of swirling maple, vanilla, chocolate, a little bit of heat.
I loved the body of this beer but the finish to was too bitter with coffee. More maple and vanilla please. 456 charactersMurchmac, Aug 13, 2010
4.65/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4On tap at Acadia Cafe, in a fluted tulip. I hate these, I'd rather have balloon snifter. Waaah.
Solid ebon hue, lovely cocoa-tan head, small, but staying, leaving some lace. Looks the part, gets me anticipating something great!
Aroma: Sweetness in the nose, coffee first, then chocolate, a bit of molasses, here comes the maple...whiskey makes a cameo.
Taste: Big, beefy and brawny, ...chocolate starts it out, slathers itself all over the palate, floats and coats...there's hints of coffee too. Oats bring the smoothness, layer on layer of flavor bring the slickness. Nice roasty character on the palate. This is one big in taste, but not overpowering. The deliciousness in this, however, is through the roof. 
Now, on to glass #2. It was so good, I had to have another. And I can't believe they still have this. 
Rich, and sweet, but not overly so. Sugary maple mixes with coffee and chocolate, and somewhere in the middle, the bourbon peeps in. It might seem like a cacophony, but there's harmony here. Gets sweeter as we go...but the depth of the flavor makes up for that. An utterly rich and complex stout. Decadent? Oh,yeah. Mmmm, but it's amazingly delicious.
Ends very evenly on the palate. Could never call it dry, but it rounds out, and stays mellow. A definite nightcapper, something to settle down with, and close down your evening in style. 1,359 charactersfeloniousmonk, Aug 12, 2010

This is why the CK is the baddest-ass bar in the District. Greg, there are no words, baby. This guy pours an Elvis painting black topped by over a finger of lovely dark tan (bordering on actual brown) foam. The nose is loaded with everything good found in big stouts: bourbon, oak, caramel corn, vanilla, maple syrup, molasses, roasted malts, light coffee, chocolate, and brown sugar-cinnamon. What's more interesting is that I could distinctly make out each of these components. Clearly. My 'strils haven't been this happily busy in a long time. And my tongue was not left out of the action. For fear of being overly redundant, everything I listed above came back, in some form or another, in the taste. In addition to a bit more bourbon, some burnt biscuits and heavy dark chocolate notes join in on the fun, while the maple syrup doesn't appear quite as strong as before. Damn, this is some tasty shit! The body has plenty of heft, with a heavy moderate carbonation and a thick, gooey, chewy feel. Overall, one of the best bourbon barrel stouts I've had the pleasure to sample. Believe the hype. 'Nuff said. 1,145 charactersTMoney2591, Aug 11, 2010

A - Opaque black with a 1 finger dark tan almost mocha colored head.
S - Strong sweet coffee aromas mixed with vanilla. Some great woodyness to the beer. No real sign of maple syrup or bourbon as the coffee definitely takes the stage here.
T - Bittersweet coffee and chocolate with roasted malts up front. Oak and vanilla definitely make an appearance mid palate. Ahhh here's the maple syrup! The maple sweetness is right at the end of the palate rounding everything out like a progression of flavors.
M - Unbelievably smooth and velvety. Not as thick as I would expect, but still medium to heavy bodied. 
D - Incredibly drinkable. A stout like this at only 9.4%?? Makes it that much more amazing to drink. My palate was quite wrecked however due to the strength of the coffee and chocolate bitterness. 947 charactersKAP1356, Aug 10, 2010

4.43/5  rDev -4.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5At Churchkey! 
A: Very dark brown body with a chocolate milk-colored head that stays around at half a finger until my first sip. Lacing is pretty good. 
S: Was not very strong. Initially all I got was rich coffee notes, but as the beer warmed up a bit of bourbon and chocolate worked their way in as well.
T: Starts off with a blast of strong but sweet coffee. I get bourbon and milk chocolate in the middle, and then more of a dark chocolate taste at the end. As I got more accustomed to the flavor, I tasted some vanilla in the middle and end as well. The aftertaste surprisingly isn't strong at all, just a bit of coffee. None of the flavors are very intense, but they are very well-balanced. I really didn't get any maple. 
M: Velvety and smooth, but I would've liked it to be a bit thicker.
D: Very drinkable. The balance, smoothness, and complexity paired with an under control abv % make this one you could have a few of. 
A very good stout. I am not giving it a 5 for flavor because as I noted earlier, though there was good complexity, the flavors were not quite as intense as I'd like, and for an American double stout, I want strong flavors. This was certainly better balanced than the regular and KBS versions. I almost wonder if the maple merely served to smooth things out and take away the cofee's bitterness, rather than imparting much of a flavor itself. Then again, other people taste the maple, so who knows?! 1,434 charactersWorldWideStout, Aug 10, 2010

a - Pours a dark black color with no carbonation evident and less than an inch of white head.

t - Tastes of roasted malts, chocolate, coffee, bourbon, and a hint of vanilla and dark fruits.
m - Medium body and low carbonation. Smooth and pretty easy to drink for 9.4% ABV.
d - Another very nice stout from Founders. I found it sweeter and obviously with less bourbon to it than KBS, but still good none the less. Some nice roasted malts and bourbon in the smell and taste, and it was pretty easy to drink. I prefer KBS, and I think Founders Breakfast Stout as well, to this, but if I saw it on a tap list I would definitely buy a glass. Glad I got to try it and would like to have again. 4/4.5/4.5/4.5/4
___
Update: I've had this beer 4 times now, most recently at Churchkey again on 10/04/11. The buzz around CBS has been insane this time around, mostly due to trading and it being in bottles, but I figured might as well go get it on tap since I probably won't get a bottle. I've really liked it in the past, but not as much as KBS and about on par with FBS, so wasn't too upset if I didn't get any bottles. All hype aside, after having this again on Tuesday I thought it was absolutely fantastic. The maple sweetness and bourbon mix amazingly with the coffee and roasted qualities, and it's super easy to drink for almost 10%. This was by far the best I've ever had and really made me wish I hadn't been so lazy looking for bottles. Oh well, next year I'll try harder. Would now put this above FBS and very close to KBS in my book.

Very near black appearance with a 1/4" dark beige head. Upon swirling the head gets bigger (oh my...), and leaves some generous lacing on the glass.
Aromas of roasted malt, bourbon.
T: Really fabulous stuff. The maple syrup element comes through more prominently in the taste than it does in the aroma. I believe this may be slightly better than KBS (I may or may not have had a KBS near me), but they are both top-notch beers, in my opinion. CBS and KBS are also very similar beers, for the most part. The melding of the barrel and roasted malt flavors is impeccable.
M: Really smooth up front and quaffable...Bang! There's some nice alcohol heat in the finish for you.
D: Fantastic beer and worthy of hype. I hope to enjoy this again, maybe even in bottles? Highly recommended. 848 charactersHuhzubendah, Aug 10, 2010

Smell: Canadian whiskey barrel, vanilla. maple, dark chocolate, oatmeal and coffee - it is all there and then some
Taste: On the opening, the dark chocolate, oatmeal and Canadian whiskey flavors are the first to emerge, along with a dark fruit complexity; by mid-palate, the maple, brown sugar, coffee and vanilla elements become more prominent as the beer adds a rather boozy aspect; after the swallow, the flavors meld together in layered complexity, though the lasting impression is chocolate, coffee and whiskey though the finish adds a tobacco character
Mouthfeel: Full bodied with low to moderate carbonation; warmth in the gullet after the swallow
Drinkability: Sippable, in small quantities, this beer is a treat to behold; one day it would be interesting to pair the BS, CBS and KBS together for a side by side tasting 971 charactersbrentk56, Aug 06, 2010
4.6/5  rDev -0.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Had this on draft at Flying Saucer here in Columbia. It was the Thursday night special keg. I showed up at the bar (the following Tuesday) hoping there would be some left. No sign of it on the "just landed" board but I asked the waitress and she said there was some left.
She brought what she said was the last glass of this awesome beer and charged a whopping $13.
Poured black with a tower of persistent cola colored foam.
The taste was all chocolate, maple syrup, and roastiness . I did not detect that much of a bourbon flavor. Chocolate was more pronounced than I had expected. Mouthfeel was full and creamy. Drinkability was solid for the style but one glass was plenty for one sitting. Wish I had a couple of bottles of this laying down.
It was a great beer and, to me, worth the $13 price tag to try. 811 charactershellomcfly, Aug 04, 2010

They got it at the Flying Saucer in Columbia and it was the rare keg last Thursday. Unfortunately at $13 a glass I felt like I was getting bent over buying it. After drinking my glass and finishing off my girlfriends glass I was left underwhelmed. I am quickly learning that a lot of these top beers are really no better than some similar ones, and I really think they are up there because of rarity. Still a great beer but just not compared to it's own hype. 
A: Very black with about a 1/4 in of Tan head. Leaves pretty good lacing behind. The deep black motor oil look that I was expecting. 
S: Cocoa, lots of roasted coffee, hints of maple but no where near as much of it as I was expecting, I kind of had to search for it. 
T: Pretty much right in line with the smell. Sweet at first, maple sweetness and a touch of alcohol, roasted malt and a burnt coffee bitterness. The maple does well to kind of smooth it out, but there is still an alcohol heat. 
M: Medium to high carbonation but thick and creamy.
D: A little hot for only being around nine percent. 1,163 charactersBS68280, Aug 04, 2010
4.82/5  rDev +4.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5On Tap at American Craft in Brookline, MA.
A - Pours a deep, deep black. The head is slight, tan. Maybe half a fingers worth quickly dissipates into a thin lacing that would hold for the rest of the glass.
S - I swear I could smell this one coming out of the tap. Everything hits you at once in a huge blast. Coffee, vanilla, cocoa, the sweetness of the maple. The smell of the alcohol lingers in the background.
T - There is so much going on here it's difficult to comprehend in the first few sips. The maple comes through first but is held tightly in balance by the bourbon hints that touch the sweet tones with a growing warmth. The oak from the bourbon barrels play naturally into the maple. The coffe and vanilla round out the taste, reminding you what this beer once was. As the beer moves out of your mouth the maple flavors bookend its taste. There's no "I wish there were more X" or "I wish the ____ was a bit muted". Perfectly balanced.
M - Full and thick, but always smooth. Alcohol is well masked with all of the flavor but you can still feel it there.
D - This beer starts to lose it's drinkability about halfway through the third glass. Don't ask me how I know.
Drinking this beer was an experience from beginning to end. Thanks to AC for acquring it. A true double rainbow all the way. 1,306 characterscharliedvrs, Aug 02, 2010
4.85/5  rDev +4.8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5In a rare turn of events set in motion back at EBF in Boston, I find myself enjoying several pints of this fantastic beer at the Backyard Ale House. I may never again enjoy this beer in such quantity...
Appearance: This beer pours a deep, murky black. My first pour had little head, as the pint glass was filled to the brim. My second pour was better, there was about a half inch worth of chocolaty colored head that hung around for a bit before fading off into a thin foamy ring around the edge of the glass. My third and final pour, which I believe kicked the keg, was mostly foam...however this pour was free so who am I to complain?
Smell: Out of this world! A delicious blend of chocolate and coffee blended together and mellowed out with a sweet, candy-like maple.
Taste: With every sip this beer just kept getting better. Chocolate and coffee, maple syrup and some vanilla. Absolutely fantastic the way this beer is put together. According to the Founder's rep, this beer comes in at 11% ABV, but there's no hint of that at all.
Mouthfeel: Smooth and creamy, perfect carbonation for the style. A tad bit light in the body for a stout this big, but nothing to really gripe about.
Drinkability: An absolutely fantastic beer that I am lucky to be able to enjoy. It tastes great and goes down smooth. The sweetness does get to you after a while, after a couple of pints I was really needing me some hops. All in all, this has to be one of the best beers I've ever enjoyed. I can't recommend it enough.
Special thanks to Stef and John for putting together this fantastic event! 1,585 characterskrisandajt, Jul 30, 2010

Don't remember a head to mention on this beer. The nice smooth tast with a nice back ground aspects of oak from the wisky barles and maple syrup.
The most mentionable thing about this beer is the residule sugar left coating the glass after done drinking it.

4.55/5  rDev -1.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5On-tap at the Brick Store.
Pours black with a half-finger light brown head. The head recedes into a wispy layer on top leaving solid lacing.
Smells of large amounts of roasted malt, dark chocolate, and coffee. Lurking in the background are hints of sweet maple and vanilla.
Tastes very similar to how it smells. Smooth roasted malt and coffee flavors kick things off. Shortly thereafter the coffee fades a bit, allowing room for semi-sweet chocolate and good amounts of vanilla. Midway through the sip hints of maple syrup work their way into things before fading out into a moderately bitter ending.
Mouthfeel is great, as is the mouthfeel for all iterations of FBS - a great thickness with grainy carbonation.
Drinkability is very good. I finished my glass quickly and could easily have a few more.
Overall I was a big fan of this beer but I have to say that I enjoyed KBS more. If I had to choose I would go with KBS, CBS, and FBS. The coffee flavors are more muted in both KBS and CBS however the bourbon flavors that I love are obviously more pronounced in KBS.

The beer pours black with no head. There are a few tan bubbles floating on the surface of the beer. The aroma is great. I get notes of maple syrup, oak, chocolate and roasted malt. The flavor is equally impressive. There is a lot of maple, vanilla, chocolate milk, coffee, roasted malt and the slightest hint of soy sauce. Low carbonation and medium to thick mouthfeel. A great beer that lived up to the hype. Hopefully I will get to try this again. 501 charactersMora2000, Jul 26, 2010
4.87/5  rDev +5.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Finally got to get a try of this stuff at the Brewers Guild Fest in Ann Arbor 2010. It was one beer that brought me to this fest with such excitement. 
Pours out really really solid black with a creamy, dark reddish tan head. 
The maple here stands out super nicely as does the bourbon. Lots of oats, vanilla, bourbon, maple, roast and maybe a little alcohol from it all. It smells absolutely delicious. 
Taste is even better. This is a very roasty beer but its sweetened up a lot by maple, vanilla, oak, oatmeal and chocolate. Coffee, alcohol and intense roast flavors bitter it down. The result is a very nicely balanced, but very big, beer.
I can now rest happily having gotten to try this. Only thing now is I want more... 730 charactersMbpBugeye, Jul 25, 2010

A - Black as night. Tan head but not much of a head.
S - Vanilla and caramel with some coffee roast. Maple syrup and bourbon are definitely present. Smells a bit hot but delicious.
T - real smooth bourbon flavor. I mean wow, it blends flawlessly with the rest of the flavors in this beer. There is a hint of sweetness from the maple but I can't really pick up the flavor strong enough to place it if I didn't know it was there. Really a great tasting big beer.
M - Heavy body but smooth. A bit syrupy with very little carbonation. But that is to be expected with a barrel aged IS.
D - Wow. Easy drinking for the ABV. I would drink this again any time the opportunity arose. A simply phenomenal beer. Love it! 827 charactersjpmclaug, Jul 20, 2010

This beer is definitely of the same blood as KBS. It has the same coffee, chocolate, vanilla, smokey flavor, but then has an added maple sweetness that smooths any harshness out. Absolutely phenomenal beer. Glad to have tried it, but now may be even more tempted to open up the bottle I have. 510 characterslevifunk, Jul 18, 2010

8 ounce pour for $7.50. Served by a cute bartender. 
Beautiful black pour with a creamy dark brown froth. Looks great! 
Smells wonderful, the coffee grabs you first then the chocolate, I can't say I detect the maple but there is a sweet scent that I like. This really smells good.
Tastes incredible! Wow! The coffee and chocolate, I think I taste the maple but it is very subtle. 
This is full-bodied with perfect carbonation.
I could drink this all day. 
This is one of the best beers I've ever had. Hopefully our paths will cross again someday. 593 charactersNorthsideFred, Jul 17, 2010
5/5  rDev +8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Part of me feels so wrong for giving 5's to every category, but I honestly don't know how the beer could have done better in any of the categories listed.
Pours a pitch black with a slight tan head. The beer just looks inviting, unlike some bigger stouts that can look a little "dead" in the glass.
Smell is coffee and chocolate upfront with a little bit of sweetness behind, but to me the coffee dominates the initial nose. Still, I could just sit and smell this thing for an hour if it didn't taste so damn good.
Taste seems a bit more evened out and the coffee isn't as overpowering as in the smell. The sweetness is evident, but not syrupy or overpowering to me. I get maybe a hint of alcohol but even that works in a pleasant way with the other flavors.
Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, reminds me almost of hot chocolate at times. Carbonation seems pretty minimal, which is appropriate given what we're working with.
My matra for big stouts is generally, even for the ones I love, that I can only drink a pint or so before it stops being so enjoyable, based on the heavyness of the style more than anything. For this beer I would make the exception. For as big as it is, it's silly easy to drink. 
FBS was already one of my absolute favorite beers of any style, and this basically takes it and...well, to put it simply, makes it better. Any stout fan needs to seek this one out. 1,389 charactersmechamifune, Jul 15, 2010

I've had this on 2 occasions now, once from the batch last year, and now this time. Taste is definitely a lot more balanced this time around. I enjoyed the higher level of sweetness of the first batch, but this is a better overall beer. Pour is very dark with a tan head. Aroma is chocolate, roasted coffee, and a background of oaky maple sweetness, pretty subtle actually. Taste is very smooth. Flavors are all well integrated: all of the regular breakfast stout flavors but with the added maple sweetness, and oak from the barrel. As it warmed up it became even better, and the chocolate definitely takes the driver seat. Stellar beer, and easily put away two 12oz snifters. I love Founders. 769 characterskhumbard, Jul 13, 2010

from the tap as close to pitch black that dark chocolate can get into a 12oz snifter with a short lasting thin foam head that leaves lacing to the lip of the glass.
aroma is quite subtle - coffee, chocolate, toffee.
subtlety disappears once the first sip reaches the lips... strong coffee / espresso notes forward immediately fading to smooth chocolate, vanilla and sweet maple. absolutely incredible. believe all you have heard. meant to be sipped ? maybe so, but it's hard to let it just sit there. a second pour will be needed. as it warms, taste transitions to the chocolate cake other reviewers have noted.
very smooth to the palate, alcohol burn is nonexistent - entirely hidden. 
drinkability - at 9.4%, this one shouldn't be as drinkable as it seems - I'll be having a second, but it's going to require me staying on this stool for a good while afterward... 969 charactersrobwestcott, Jul 12, 2010
4.51/5  rDev -2.6%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4A- A thick, syrupy, pitch black liquid with a thin brown head that has good retention. Perfect.
S- Coffee, vanilla, caramel, chocolate cake, and a slightly sweet maple syrup aspect. Smells pretty tame at first, but really opens up as it warms.
T- Coffee, chocolate cake, maple syrup, vanilla. Extremely rich and decadent with a wonderful robust chocolate aspect. No alcohol presence. A nice balance of sweet and roasty.
M- Velvety smooth and creamy with a lasting dry, roasted presence.
D- Rich and delicious. A bit of a sipper. Doesn't quite stand up to KBS in my book, but it is still world class.
This is the third time I have had this beer. The first time it was unbelievably sweet, the second time almost having no detectable maple syrup aspect. Founders really seems to have it nailed down here. 806 charactersgordavidson, Jul 10, 2010

The elusive Canadian displays an opaque darkness that clings to the edges of the glass with a sugary, syrup-like viscosity. The head is dirty khaki in color and retains surprisingly well for the ABV. Swirling the snifter quickly builds the foam level, but the aroma never really took off for me. Smells a bit muddled, in fact, with ethanolic booze and soft chocolate undertones. The sweetness is there, but I'm not getting too much maple or barrel aroma.
CBS' flavor more than makes up for what the aroma 'lacks'. A delicious mix of dark chocolate, toffee, earthy hop bitterness, Grand Marnier, and sweet, sweet maple. The syrupy sweetness never becomes cloying, however, making this beer surprisingly quaffable despite its big, complex body. The mouthfeel helps the drinkability, too, as Canadian is light on the tongue (heavy in the stomach) and almost fluffy with carbonation. All in all, a superb beer clearly worthy of the hype (a rarity these days). 1,027 characterswagenvolks, Jul 08, 2010
4.95/5  rDev +6.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Bottle #47 of 55 from CBX, poured into my Stone RIS tulip.
A - Inky dark black with a bubbly chocolate mousse head that re-formed itself after every swirl. Eventually it settled to a thick ring around the edge of the glass. Outstanding sticky lacing.
S - Definite coffee smell in the forefront with sweet dark malt. Notes of vanilla, oak, and maple syrup.
T - Explosions of coffee, dark sweet malts, oak and vanilla with a subtle maple syrup sweetness on the back-end. Incredibly well put together and balanced, the flavors exist in perfect harmony.Absolutely no alcohol detected. Complex as hell.
M - Creamy and smooth. Silky. Again, no apparent ABV, unlike KBS, which can be a bit hot sometimes. Prickly carbonation is spot-on.
D - One of the best beers I've ever had, I could drink only this for the rest of my life and be perfectly happy. So complex yet balanced, just an amazing offering from Founder's. 913 charactersjsanford, Jul 03, 2010

S: It smells like breakfast with a steaming cup of coffee in your face. Massive oak and whisky aroma with a side of chocolate pancakes 
T: Taste was huge, like the nose. So complex, so much going on. Very tough to single it all out. Thick roasted malt, bourbon, coffee, maple syrup, more bourbon, maybe some vanilla and oak. My tastebuds are completely enveloped. Compared to KBS this has a much smoother bourbon shot to it. The flavors explode in the beginning taste and somehow it all disappears just leaving a coffee aftertaste. So complex yet so balanced. whatever that maple did was great for the beer
M: It reminds me of a beer on nitro. so little carbonation just lets this beer reach every inch on my tastebuds without blowing up but still having enough just to wake them. Its a sweeter beer but it doesn't leave to much of a sticky mouthfeel.
D: I said it to someone while drinking it so I'll write it down. Every sip is like the first one again and again. I love how the beer somehow disappears after that huge flavor upfront. while I feel its easy drinking compared to beers with higher gravity (BCBCS) the booziness is about the same so I cant give it a 5. I drank two glasses and I wanted a third but not because of the rarity, it was because it was good. 1,428 characterschefmikeanderson, Jul 03, 2010

Jet black, mocha colored foam rim around the slick surface. Coffee, oak, vanilla flavors mix in with sweet notes. As it warms up the maple presence comes out more and more. The alcohol is pretty undetectable, I think this is more complex and balanced than the KBS. The carbonation cuts the thickness for a slightly less than chewy feel. CBS is a great beer, one of my favorites, I want some waffles with this next time. 504 charactersliquidcraft, Jun 28, 2010
5/5  rDev +8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Served on tap at Founders in an over-sized brandy glass. The chalk board lists this as 10%abv.
A: poured perfectly, leaving plenty of headspace in the snifter for room to swirl this velvety elixir. The body is jet black. Around the rim a thin ring of chocolate colored foam resides, formed by an active layer of lacing just under the brew's surface.
S: swirling the brew around the snifter releases a torrent of aromatics, including caramel, coffee, molasses, vanilla, and maple. No one character dominates the other, allowing all to ring harmoniously in the nose.
T: This rich nectar has an intensely malty body, complemented by molasses, maple, vanilla, rum, and maple. Truly an experience.
M: thick, velvety, creamy; the body bolsters this brew's rich demeanor.
D: I was shocked by how quickly this brew rocketed to its place on the best of BA list, and decided that it must be had. When o found out that it had been tapped the other day, I decided to wake up early in case the keg got bum-rushed. Fortunately, I made it in time to experience this delightful brew. I highly recommend it, as it rivals any other RIS in quality and flavor. 1,145 charactersAvagadro, Jun 09, 2010
4.6/5  rDev -0.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Basically black with a small beige head. 
Small lacings, but the beer reacts beautifully when the glass is swirled. 
The aroma is intense - lots of fat malts, molasses, smooth bourbon, dough, and maple syrup. The character is heavy, but it's still fresh and alive. Great integration in the nose. 
The taste is almost unbelievable. The body is beyond full and the mouthfeel is beyond smooth and creamy - this is like cream covered in velvet. It is nicely carbonated, which is very delightful. Lovely sweet malty flavor with s smooth bitter accompanying roastiness. Notes of coffee. The barrel character is flawless . smooth toned-down nutty bourbon with hints of wood and vanilla, and sweet fresh maple syrup with hints of honey. A noticeable bitterness develops towards the finish as the beer ends with caramel, toffee, powdery coffee and a hint of alcohol. 
This is, from start to finish, a very well made beer. Ridiculously complex, perhaps bordering what is possible with beer without it collapsing in a mess. Here, instead we get great balance and integration. I must say that I find it interesting that the barrel aging made its mouthfeel so full compared to the regular Breakfast stout. Well well, to sum it up: this might be the best barrel aged imperial stout I've ever had. 1,286 charactersricke, May 16, 2010
5/5  rDev +8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Had this at the brewpub, and at first thought it was very good ( as claimed/reported). But as it warmed slightly it began to evolve into a delicious highly (dangerously) drinkable draft. I have had many Founders brews, but this was so exceptional, and so remarkable that I now believe this is as goos as it gets. It has an exceptionally good nose, followed by a perfect mouth. The flavor is, let's face it, just out and out delicious. Hints of vanilla and wood, then the maple...soft, subtle but not overwhelming...just perfectly complementary.

A-Jet black color with almost no head or lacing as a result of the tap fill. I'm sure a "rougher" pour would result in a thick mocha brown head, but I digress.
S-Sweet maple, bourbon, roasted coffee and malts with hints of vanilla and chocolate.
T-This beer is going to be tough to beat as the best beer made, and for me, the best I've ever had at this point in my BA experience. There is a nice blend of the coffee, maple and chocolatey flavors with some oakey mustiness to provide some character. The bourbon is there but definitely a back seat driver with this brew.
M-Creamy, rich and buttery with minimal carbonation and an overall smooth pleasant finish.
D-This is a sipper, but well worth every sip and worthy of its high top ten rating...bravo Founders! 829 charactersbierenutz, May 02, 2010

Got a 12oz bottle of left over bottles ran through the founders bottleing machine.
Pours a dark black. No head. No lacing. Looks flat
Aroma really only smells like awesome coffee. Not much else.
Taste is the best beer j may have ever had. Tastes like a chocolate covered espresso bean in a glass. Great coffee flavor but not too much, the maple is amazing with all the other flavors and a little bourbon. The chocolate is tasty as well. Like bitter sweet. Such an awesome beer.
Mouthfeel is actually good. Although I think it might be better in tap. Nice light carb. Not too thick.
Overall an amazing beer that I am glad I have more of. Can't wait to drink this again. 846 charactersPeprSprYoFace, Apr 23, 2010
4.67/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Finally got to try this - visited the Monday after the Black Party. Had it on tap, of course - 8 ounces served in a snifter. Pours an oily blank with only a thin right of lace. Very light aromas of maple syrup, with touches of chocolate and cocoa bitterness, hints of some wood. Very rich taste, too: maple syrup, slight twinge of alcohol, sweet but oaky, with a slight bitterness in the finish. The maple syrup sweetness grows as the beer warmed up a bit, and to my taste it became a little unbalanced. It's smooth as all get-out. This is a super drinkable and amazingly delicious beer. And as an added bonus, one of my co-drinkers, who hails from Vancouver, BC, declared the beer "Canadian approved." Need we say more? 720 charactersndekke39, Apr 23, 2010

A - Totally oily black tap pour with a low dense tan head. Low retention and lace chunks are left over on the inside of the glass. Not much to look at after mere moments.
S - Dark roasted malts back up the full, thick aroma of rich vanilla and maple syrup. Really rich and smooth with molasses and caramel notes swirling around. An ever-present coffee roasted scent meanders though the background. The booziness is there but not outrageous. Delicious! I could smell this for ever!
T - Lots of maple and bourbon flavor with a dark roasted malt backing but a generally thin profile for how the nose comes across. The roasted coffee is much more present in the flavor than in the nose. Molasses seems to be a bigger part of the flavor profile too.
M - The profile is a little thinner than I expected from this one actually! It's full-bodied but not syrupy or thick like I had hoped for, rather it's still smooth before the slightly dry finish with a light boozy sensation.
D - This one is a sipper for sure. I was hoping for a bit more maple syrup flavor going on here but it's one damn good beer! Like I mentioned, the barrel aging is all over the place but never gets out-of-control. 1,276 charactersBeerFMAndy, Apr 18, 2010
4.82/5  rDev +4.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5On-tap at Stoutfest, Armsby Abbey. My next few reviews from the fest will be brief, too stoked and busy to take notes, but I remember the beers well for sure. Glad I got this before it kicked. Appearance is black, nice bubbly tan head that sticks around the whole time and leaves lacing. Smell I pick up alot of the coffee and some sweetness and chocolate but not much maple. The taste though, especially when it warms up, brings out the maple in such a great way. The maple goes so great with coffee, chocolate, and some vanilla, definitely fits it's name quite well. The bourbon brings one the vanilla flavor but the booze taste is seriously non-existent. Roasty flavors are there but take a backseat to all the sweet flavors here. Definitely a great first beer of the day choice at noon, I would love to sip this with a real Canadian breakfast. The mouthfeel is great, a perfect thickness and there is no alcohol taste here at all. I saved the last 2-3 ounces for a friend who missed it on-tap and before I knew it I had to stop drinking this. Very easy to drink. Infinitely more drinkable than Kentucky (fresh), more complex and flavorful than the regular Breakfast Stout, best out of the 3 probably. I wish it was a little cheaper but who knows when I will get to try this again.
**4/16/11 more notes**
Lucky to have this again at Stoutfest this year, as good as last years was this years killed it. Way more maple presence without being overpowering, awesome balance of flavors.

A chocolaty fragrance with a touch of whiskey a wood and coffee scents follow. A rich chocolaty flavor, with coffee overtones, then the sweet woodsy flavor of whiskey that comes through at the halfway point across the palate; a maple syrup sweetness blends itself into the flavor that gradually grows to at the soft flavor of a grassy bitterness. A thick oily texture, that begins with a heavy water feel that grows in weight. A mild burn of alcohol on the throat, but it does not last long. This is an easy to drink stout you have no idea that this beer is ten percent. The dark and rich inviting color, with an intoxicating aroma, along with the beautiful and wonderful taste and finishing with a sticky and oily texture makes this a great beer 873 characterscameraman, Apr 09, 2010

Fantastic color, deep brown tinged black. This baby sucked all the light out of the room. Thin brown head at the top of the snifter hinting at the coffee chocolate flavored goodiness I have come to expect with this variety of beer.
Smell is inviting. Coffee and maple sweetness is there. I have a large nose and I almost dipped into the brew because I wanted to really smell this one. Mouth was watering immediately in anticipation.
Taste is coffee, chocolate bitterness, with a hint of maple sweetness. Oatmeal is there. This tastes like a perfect breakfast on a Sunday morning. Now I did have last years version and it was sweeter. The flavors are well balanced. Nothing was over bearing. Big alcohol but with so much going on, you will not taste it. With that said I liked last years better by one notch. What can I say, I have a sweet tooth.
Drinkability is based on style. In terms of what it is this baby is smooth as silk. Goes down real easy almost to easy. Unlike its cousin KBS, this one is not nearly as hot. It still is a sipper, but hey the longer it takes the more time to savor. This is worth driving to the brewery for if its on tap. 1,197 charactersTetano, Apr 05, 2010

S: Coffee all the way. Like the best cup of coffee you have ever had. Elegant, strong and soothing.

4.72/5  rDev +1.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Received a bottle of this from a generous BA...what a hook-up!
Split between two tulips and shared with some friends. Pours dark dark brown, allowing virtually no light to pass. Very thin head, that disappears very quickly. Not sure exactly how the filling and capping of this bottle happened, but I'm guessing that some of the "thin head" can be attributed to bottling a beer that isn't generally bottled. Looks very similar to this year's KBS as well.
A strong coffee aroma coupled with fainter whiffs of chocolate, cherry, and smokiness. Again, reminiscent of the KBS, with a little different twist.
The coffee and roasted malts stick around through the entirety of each drink. Definite cherry / dark fruit in there as well. I also continue to get hints of a very nice smokiness...this is a great beer. Although I do get a bit of sweetness in there, I think it can more closely be associated with a semi-sweet chocolate as opposed to maple syrup. I really tried to get maple syrup out of this beer, but just couldn't find it. Don't get me wrong - Great flavor, excellent taste, but no maple...at least for me. Nice and thick and creamy. Just how I like these kinds of stouts. Outstanding.
Overall , I was very impressed with this beer. It is a bit fresh and stinging, but it's also less than a month old. Still a very drinkable brew, especially considering an ABV of nearly 10%. This was a great introduction to the Canadian Breakfast Stout; now I need to track it down on tap.

4.75/5  rDev +2.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Reviewed from notes taken 1/25. This came from a CP-filled bottle - out of a keg, so I will call it a growler, I think that's the best qualification for it.
The beer pours black, with a beautiful thick, dense brown head, leaving a little bit of lacing down the glass. Looks great from the start. The smell is amazing. You can really smell the sweetness upfront, the maple syrup really enhances that, and it blends and mellows well with the bourbon smell, the charred, roasty, toasty, oak and dark malt combinations, also bringing out a bit of vanilla, and the coffee is in there too, almost getting lost in the incredible mix of smells. A really great smelling beer. The taste, to but it briefly is incredible. This is one of those beers that you hear so much about, you just can't believe that it's true, I actually wanted to like this less than I did. It starts out creamy and chocolatey, the sweetness, combined with the roasty flavors, make it like drinking a coffee and chocolate milkshake, but it's not cloyingly sweet - which may be in part thanks to the oaky-bourbony taste. The syrup isn't necessarily easily picked out, but this is definitely reminiscent of syrup, even so much to make me crave pancakes as a start to dig into it. The vanilla of the barrel really comes out in the taste as well, and I still can't say enough about the rich creaminess, jsut balanced perfectly with the dark roastiness. I mean, it's possibly one of the smoothest (I know that word is a bit lame, thanks the AB) beers I've ever tasted. Just perfect mouthfeel, moderate carbonation, to let you know it's there, but not slow you down any. The drinkability is great, though it's a heavy hitter. I mean, I could barely stop drinking to take notes, but the ABV caught up with me by the end, making the last few sips a little slow, but I really, really loved this beer. 1,855 characterstaylorhamrick, Mar 12, 2010

Pours with a thick, oil-like consistency, almost totally opaque in the glass, just the slightest of brown around the edge when held to a moderately bright light. A half finger of cappuccino foam rises on top and sits for a short time, slowly falling to the surface and leaving a thick collar where it meets the glass.
S - Really deep and roasty with some nice dark fruit aspects...good amounts of coffee and bittersweet chocolate. Struggling a bit to find the maple syrup...I know it's gotta be there, but it's not hitting me in the face (must retract this...as it warms the maple really starts to come out). Maybe even a touch of bourbon and some vanilla in there too. Excellent.
T - Really smooth flavors and lots of them. I'm struck first by the large presence of vanilla - almost like melted vanilla ice cream - smooth and sweet. Also picking up quite a bit of woody oak flavors here too. The barrels have worked some magic on this one. Actually quite a bit of bitterness overall too - good hop presence without much flavor added to it - just bitterness. This blends nicely with the dark roasted malt and serious coffee flavors found here. Maple syrup - not sure, without some advance knowledge I'd identify this as maple syrup, but knowing what I know I can definitely find the maple here. It takes form of a complementary sweetness that combines with the vanilla exceptionally well. Sit these on top of a nice bitter base and we have ourselves one excellent stout.
M - The flavor is excellent, but the mouthfeel is really a standout feature of this stout. It is so silky and creamy feeling - feels like I'm drinking heavy cream. Thick and oily -slick on the tongue. Being a hand bottle, not sure about how the carbonation was intended to present itself, but it fits quite nicely for me. Carbonation is on the low side, but definitely not flat...has just enough life to tingle the tongue gently and caress it as the beer floats down the throat. Any more carbonation and I'd be afraid of it being a bit distracting. I've had a couple of beers recently with amazing mouthfeel...this takes a new 2nd place behind the BA Blackout which was amazing.
D - Alcohol really doesn't make itself known very well. There are so many wonderful sweet and desert-like flavors swimming around in this stout, the alcohol might be consumed among them. This really is a fabulous beer...if anything, I feel like it's missing a bit of the maple I remember (but maybe I'm romanticizing my first experience with this beer), but it hardly matters. Excellent American imperial stout...highly recommend doing whatever it takes to try this beer...hope Founders finds it within themselves to bottle this as some sort of regular seasonal offering. 2,951 charactersportia99, Mar 10, 2010

Notes are scant, so I'll just bang out the highlights. Jet black stout w/creamy head. Smell is phenomenal with vanilla, maple, booze, wood all pouring out. Taste is shockingly good. Especially when tasted alongside KBS and FBS. The other bottles actually cowered and ran off in the Canadian's presence. We've got maple syrup, serious sweetness including vanilla and chocolate perfectly balanced w/roast and some slight bourbon/oaky character. Mouth is thick w/the sweetness making it a true breakfast-worthy beer. Highly recommend. Lived up to the hype for me and then some. 620 charactersbret27, Feb 28, 2010
5/5  rDev +8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A-Dark Dark Chocolate. Perfection to me is a beer you can't see through, and this beer definitely fits the bill. 
S-Bitter chocolate, burnt coffee. Almost a hint of something peppery. Reminds me of hung over mornings with far away friends in foreign places. 
T-Extremely delicious, melt in your mouth goodness. The regular breakfast stout is my staple go-to beer at Founder's when it is available, and this one-ups it nicely. Maple and vanilla afterthoughts, bold rich coffee. 
M-Thick and rich, as it should be. A meal in itself.
D-Why is this beer so drinkable? I could drink it all night, but Founder's has far too many other great beers on tap to stick with just one. I will have as much of this beer as possible while it is available, and I look forward to trying KBS in a few weeks to compare it. 806 characterssullenbee, Feb 28, 2010
4.63/5  rDev 0%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.58 oz pour into a snifter at the Founders Taproom. Pours deep dark brown (not black) with a medium tan head. Delicious looking beer. Smells of coffee, rich chocolate, maple and a bit of alcohol. Tastes like something you would get at starbucks like my buddy said. Almost reminds me of a mocha frappucino. Milk chocolate, mocha, bitter coffee, maple, oak, lots going on here. Mouthfeel is thick, lush, creamy, warming and comforting. All I can say about the drinkability is that I watched my buddy put away his 12 oz pour like it was a pale ale. Its really high. I could drink this all night but there are too many other beers on the tap list I want to try. Absolutely amazing beer, my only gripe is I wonder how different it really is from KBS. I'd really like to try them side by side. Maybe I'll have the chance on the 13th at the KBS release party. 850 charactersShumista, Feb 27, 2010
4.9/5  rDev +5.8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from the tap into a tasting glass.
The color is a complete black with a thin tan head and some little lacing on the glass.
The smell is deep coffee with some fresh coffee bean flavor. Some dark chocolate flavor is in the background and gives a nice robust feel.
The taste is big with some nice chocolate flavor that comes out strong. There are some nice coco and mocha flavors that really give a breakfast feel. Some bourbon flavor does come out here and there and there are many complex flavors throughout this beer it would take a while to name them all.
The feel of this beer really well balanced. There is a nice sweet flavor that smooths out the alcohal feel in this beer and hides it well in some great flavor. It goes down nice and smooth and is very enjoyable. 779 charactersDuhast500, Feb 26, 2010
4.75/5  rDev +2.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5I had this at the Founders Taproom yesterday, as the last leg of a Midwest trip. What a great way to finish off a fun trip! Thanks to my good friend and fellow BA TCGoalie for giving me the heads up that this was available at the brewery. 
I'm always a little wary of reviewing a beer that I know is rated so highly, but this one made it easy. So tasty and enjoyable to imbibe. This review is from detailed notes. 
A: Poured almost jet-black with just a little bit of a brownish tint into a tall, thin, 12 ounce glass that was flared at the top. The head was an attractive mocha that had just about disappeared by the time the beer was brought to me. The beer left a small, dotty, sticky lacing pattern on the sides of the glass, along with a clear, thick film that coated the glass after a sip. 
S: As soon as I saw that the smaller pours of this were served in a snifter, I was a little sad that I got the tall 12 oz. glass, because it was a little more difficult to catch the full aroma. However, my girlfriend got the smaller pour a little later, so I was able to get the full effect of the smell from her pour. The main scent was a medium-bodied coffee bean. There was a nice maple sweetness that accompanied the coffee smell, and just a hint of toffee and caramel. It smelled like I imagine a Canadian household smelling at breakfast-time. 
T: Phenomenal. The rich flavor was so well balanced between the maple sweetness and the slight acidic coffee taste. The taste starts out sweet and then as the sip is finished, a slight bitter hop characteristic takes over. However the taste left in the mouth after the sip is that rich, coating maple sweetness again. Such a complex and rich flavor. Every component ingredient was perfectly proportioned to the others. 
M: Full and coating. The feel was so exciting and satisfying. The beer really disperses its flavors evenly and thickly over the palate. The carbonation was so perfect for this beer that it was almost an afterthought. 
D: Not surprisingly, this beer had a fabulous drinkability. I never thought that the sweetness of the flavor overpowered my palate, and there was no alcohol detectable. This beer was so flavorful and rich. Founders really has a good thing going with their Breakfast Stout line and I can't wait to try the Kentucky version soon! 2,318 charactersTCHopCraver, Feb 25, 2010
4.08/5  rDev -11.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4A: Poured a nice rich black color. The head was mocha in color. Quite a bit of lacing for a beer of this test.
S: The thing I kept expecting in this beer and never getting was sweetness. I expected to get a huge maple syrup nose but truth be told it was barely there. Lots of coffee and chocolate. A touch of roast. Little bit of barrel but not that much.
T: Just like the nose. Again not that sweet at all. Big coffee taste. Chocolate after that. Maybe some nuts thrown in there as well.
M: Much lighter than I thought it would be. Very creamy mouthfeel. Nice level of carbonation.
D: This beer was a little bit of a letdown for me. It was an excellent beer for sure but I expected more. I enjoyed KBS much more than this and it was slightly ahead of regular breakfast stout. That being said it would be a nice addition to their bottled offerings. 852 charactersaerozeppl, Feb 24, 2010

Pours darkest brown with a nice tan foamy head and some syrupy legs. Aroma is black roasty malts, coffee, maple syrup, smoke, and caramel. Pretty nice, but not as good as the flavor, which is absurd. Chewably thick body, tons of roasted malts and dark chocolate tempered by a smokey maple syrup note with wood, sweet bourbon-like accents, espresso, faint berries. Incredible. Dry and slightly bitter, no astringency, full bodied, epic. 506 charactersillidurit, Feb 23, 2010
4.69/5  rDev +1.3%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Had on tap in a taster glass at EBF 2010
Appearance: pours a deep rich syrup like color with a small hazlenut head that recedes quickly.
Smell: smells fantastic. Sweet, canadian bacon, maple syrup and waffle like aromas come through. Creamy aroma too.
Taste: tastes like liquid bacon, waffles and maple syrup. Balanced though all of the sweetness with bitter chocolate flavors and a slight alcohol bite. This was my favorite stout at the fest for sure. Creamy whipped cream like texture and flavors meld well with the chocolate shavings and bourbon undertones.
Mouthfeel: Very creamy and easy to drink. Hides the abv incredibly and leaves the mouth slightly dry. Texture and finish are second to only kentucky breakfast stout.
Drinkability: Huge for such a powerful beer. This was such a treat and its perfect with rich dishes as well as by itself. Creamy, balanced, focused through the whole session! 906 charactersAugustiner719, Feb 22, 2010
4.82/5  rDev +4.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Served on-tap at EBF 2010 in Boston, MA into a tasting glass at the appropriate temperature (02/20/10).
A: Pours a dark, dark brown nearing black with a nice 1 finger creamy light tan head.
S: Wonderful aroma of coffee, some sweet, sticky bourbon rich cocoa, milk chocolate and a wonderfully rich and potent maple syrup. 
T: I must say, that I was skeptical of the hype being given to this beer, but Founders really delivered with this beer (but when do they not). The typical elements of all great BA Imperial Stouts are found; chocolate, coffee, bourbon, oak, vanilla, ect., but the addition of the maple syrup bourbon barrel aging is just phenomenal. Sweet, sticky, rich, but never overpowering. Incredible balance in this flavor profile. 
M: Full-bodied with fairly low and creamy carbonation with a nice warming bourbon that coats the entire palate quite nicely along with the maple syrup.
D: I just hope that they bottle this as I could drink this all night long.
Overall this beer certainly lived up to its hype for me and is yet another expertly crafted Imperial Stout from Founders. Highly Recommended. 1,117 charactersLunch, Feb 22, 2010
4.5/5  rDev -2.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5This was the first beer I tried at EBF NoTB 2010. Let's see what this great brew is all aboot, eh? 
A: Pours pitch black and is virtually impervious to light. A thin tan head settled on top after a fairly gentle pour. 
S: Very strong coffee aromas dominate this legendary brew's nose. Are there freshly ground coffee beans in my tasting glass? Whiffs of sweet chocolate and feint oak also meet my nose. Overall, a strong, vibrant, and appealing nose on this one. 
T: An explosion of coffee and chocolate flavors hit my palate after the first sip. Bitter espresso, mocha, coco nibs, and dark chocolate are all present in the flavor. There is some warming sweet liquor at the finish - something along the lines of bourbon or brandy. There is some burnt coffee at the end of each sip as well. A really complex and well put together taste. 
M: It's not quite full bodied, which I think it appropriate for a brew with so many coffee characteristics in it. The alcohol is barely noticeable. 
D: Drinks dangerously well for a brew bordering on 10%. I heard the first batch of this was even better than what Founders brought to NoTB this year. However, I doubt it could have been much better than this already is. A truly exceptional stout. 1,237 charactersMrDanno96, Feb 22, 2010
4.97/5  rDev +7.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5On tap at Founders in a flute glass.
Dark black color with a light head.
Smell is heavy on the coffee, with dark chocolate and maybe slight maple mixed in. Taste is delicious: a strong coffee blended with dark chocolate syrup. Maple is present, but unless I knew that was the defining characteristic of the beer I probably wouldn't have picked up on it. This has a perfect balance between sweetness and bitterness from the coffee. Alcohol is nearly unnoticeable.. making this one of the most drinkable imperial stouts I've tried. This lived up to the massive hype that has been placed on it. 593 characterswebmanspidey, Feb 22, 2010
4.76/5  rDev +2.8%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5So glad to finally see this on tap at Founders! Notes to follow:
At first, the beer doesn't seem that exciting from the look of it, dark, not much head. Two things are unique...there is a dark amber color on the angles near the top of the glass where light can get through. Second, swish the glass around and you can see an almost candy coating on the glass. High viscosity.
I didn't get a very good smell of this beer due to the bar setting. I did get some biscuit and maple in the smell.
The first taste is sweet followed by a balancing carbonation combination of mild pine hops, coffee, chocolate, molasses, and roasty biscuit. It finishes with a lot of maple goodness. The balance is really good between the maple and other ingredients. Wonderful!
A very interesting part of this drink is the maple coating of the mouth after swallowing. It follows with a bit of stickiness, but the maple coating is so unusual.
This is a silky smooth combo that leads to a very drinkable stout. I want more! 1,000 charactersTCgoalie, Feb 21, 2010
4.17/5  rDev -9.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Had on draft at the brewery, poured into a fluted glass.
A: A deep rich chocolate with no head, only a thin ring of carbonation at the edge of the beer. It's totally opaque, and looks like... a stout. I don't know what people would consider exceptional about most stouts, let alone this one. It's good, that's about it.
S: Whiffs of coffee, chocolate, maple, with controlled booze and no hot alcohol. It's a bit nutty, too, but I might be smelling the brewery itself, to be honest. Nice.
T: Syrupy sweet with a sharp hop note along with the mild coffee flavors, with a boozy finish. Toasty roasty notes in the mid palate, with some chocolate sweetness in there as well. I'm thinking about sparking chocolate coffee syrup with a bit of hop bitterness on the tongue. It finishes sweet and boozy. Not too cloying.
M: Smooth, thick, rich - great for the beer. A nice level of carbonation helps it avoid being syrupy.
D: Not mindblowing, to be honest. Another case of an A+ beer being due to rarity and expectations vs. how the beer actually delivers. The sweetness and booziness actually detracts from the perfection of Breakfast Stout. I'm glad that it avoids being too cloying and hot with alcohol, but it's nowhere near the complex and perfectly balanced original. 1,268 charactersTelix, Feb 21, 2010

4.8/5  rDev +3.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5The beer pours a dark black color with a thick frothy brown head that slowly fades to lacing. The aroma is out of control. It has the regular Breakfast stout scent; chocolate, coffee, oatmeal. It also has a kick ass bourbon aroma with a complimentary maple syrup character. I was told by the owner at EBF that the barrels it aged in were former bourbon barrels soaked in maple syrup. The taste is incredible. It has multiple layers of complexity. The rich chocolate and oatmeal flavors along with a stiff, bitter coffee character, followed up with bourbon and maple syrup flavors. Damn, this is an incredible beer; because of the different tastes involved it's open for folks who don't normally care for dark beers. The mouthfeel is near perfect. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is maybe the best beer on the planet. The KBS was my pick before, but this may overtake it. 895 charactersWesWes, Feb 20, 2010

Just may be the best stout ever. Well, at least the best breakfast stout. Wonderful hints of maple syrup, but nowhere near overpowering. Really ties the chocolate and wood notes together into one super smooth package. Believe the hype. 376 charactersmd655321, Feb 13, 2010
4.85/5  rDev +4.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Thanks to Kevin for sharing this brew. I should extend thanks to eyebrews as well, who sent a half gallon of Canadian Breakfast Stout as an extra. That is some true Advocacy.
Pours black, reddish dark brown edges. Thin and very fine pathy head with a ring of microbubbles around the glass and a few strands of larger globules of air. The aroma is lousy with dry coffee beans, bourbon that is present but ungodly smooth, and maple that is not just sweetness but complexity and nuance, and dark chocolate. 
The flavor begins with fresh cold brewed coffee, rich, smooth, but not bitter or acidic. That dark chocolate is present as well, also rich and it comes with a mild yet rich maple and oak. There is a bit of an herbal twang to it as well, and it is hot, but in such a good way. The finish has big and sweet bourbon notes with a bread pudding type of finish. I had some skepticism toward the high regard for this beer, but this met and exceeded any and all expectation. Phenomenal. The body is thick, velvety, silky, with a light smooth carbonation.
Absolutely delicious. 1,076 charactersvacax, Feb 04, 2010

A: The pour is thick, creamy, and dark as the night with a thin layer of mocha colored head sitting on top. Some mild lacing as I drink a couple pours of this.
S: Insane amounts of fresh, roasted coffee are the first sensations to hit the nose. There are some nice undertones of bourbon, oak, and chocolate. The maple aromas are present, but not super bold.
T: All the good things about the nose are translated to the flavors of the beer. The coffee is once again very intense, with an ever so slight maple sweetness. The oak and bourbon flavors provide a touch of sweet vanilla to the beer.
M: Despite the travel from Michigan to CA, this growler has held up quite nicely. A smooth, creamy mouthfeel and a nice full body.
D: I cannot say enough nice things about this beer. I'm absolutely thrilled to have had the opportunity to try it, and I would drink more of this again in a heartbeat. 1,045 characterswomencantsail, Feb 04, 2010

A - Poured into a snifter. Pours dark black/brown with a tiny, large bubbled dark khaki head.
S - Oh, just incredible. The coffee aroma comes out sharp and powerful - like a handful of freshly ground coffee beans. The coffee scent is engulfed in a sweet sugary whiff of maple syrup. 
T - Again, terrific. The flavor, when the beer first hits the tongue, is bourbon-tastic. Vanilla bean and bourbon, right off the bat. Maple syrupy sweetness sort of acts as landing gear for the first burst of alcoholic flavor. This quickly delves back into strongly boozy. The aftertaste is powerful, sweet, and alcoholic. 
M - Velvety, smooth, and medium bodied. Not as thick as some other powerful stouts, but I think this is calculated as sometimes thicker beers with high levels of sweetness can come off as too syrupy.
D - Due to the ABV I doubt I could really drink a ton of this stuff, but I sure as hell would like to try.
Did it live up to the hype? Yes. Yes it did. 1,094 charactersHeyItsChili, Jan 29, 2010

In any case, I've been looking for this one for ever, so was very excited to find it in my area. Pour was pitch black with no highlights, a small finger of tan head that left solid lacing on my glass. Nose is a little milder than expected - surprisingly fruity, chocolate and roasted malt. Nice, but nothing compared with the monstrous flavor that comes through. Huge chocolate and roasted malt up front. Then the maple syrup shows up subtly, adding a sort of unique spicy vanilla flavor. Really big, delicious flavor. Body is thick and creamy, full, with smooth carbonation that works perfectly. Overall, this beer was near perfect for me. Exceptional taste and drinkability, all kinds of complexity. Would unquestionably have this again if I ever had the opportunity.

4.75/5  rDev +2.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Happy new year to me! I was just sitting at home tonight getting ready for a night with just me and the girlfriend, making some good food and getting some beer from the collection chilled when I happened to check out Churchkey's Twitter page. CBS on tap tonight 5:00 pm! I explained I couldn't pass this up and we were out front in line at 4:45. As soon as they opened they had CBS snifters pre-poured expecting the majority of people in line to order them. Served in a 10oz snifter.
Appearance was black with a thin tan covering that clung to the sides of the glass. Laced nicely on the glass as I drank it.
Aroma was great, chocolate, coffee and roasted grains were all present but the chocolate was the most present. The barrel characteristics also came through with a vanilla and slight bourbon aroma. 
Taste was amazing, complex, smooth and delicious. Chocolate again was the dominating flavor but coffee, roasted grains, vanilla and bourbon. There was some sweetness to it as well, couldn't really identify it as maple but I'd like to think it was the maple barrel effect on the beer.
Mouthfeel was full bodied and creamy with below average carbonation. I don't think I could have asked for a better feeling beer, carbonation was just right and it had a nice body to it.
Drinkability was very good, it was so smooth for the abv. The chocolaty flavor made it very easy drinking and although the barrel characteristics were there they were not overpowering. Could have had several of these if we didn't have to leave.
overall this has to be one of the top beers I have ever had and probably the top stout to date. I was expecting coffee and maple to have a stronger presence and instead it was chocolate that stole the show. Awesome, so glad I got to finally try this one. 1,782 charactersbillab914, Dec 31, 2009

...seriously. Never thought I'd be drinking this beer.
A- Dark, robust brown, khaki head, moderate carbonation, fantastic for a handbottle (it 'popped' when opened.. yes!)
S- Whoa. Coffee, maple/honey, rich sugars, smoke. A good deal of smoke. Really complex... begging to be poured into my mouth. Won't deny this beer it's moment of glory...
T- Maple is there, but the smoky barrels come through a lot stronger. The woodiness and campfire notes are delicious. The bitter coffee notes do wonders here, and I get a hint of bitter chocolate to round it all out. The honey/maple sweetness and a bit of buttery/caramel bourbon are icing on the cake. Damn.
M- Great body and mouthfeel. No complaints here, good job to Founders. 
D- Um, I'd drink three growlers back-to-back-to-back if I could. I want to drink this morning, noon, and night. No sign of the ABV, nothing but pure awesomeness.
And I don't even consider stouts to be anywhere near my favorite style. This one is just that good.
If/when CBS is re-released, I will be drinking it until I run out of money. World-class in every sense, this is what beer is all about. If only it wasn't so hard to come by... 1,220 charactersShogoKawada, Dec 28, 2009

4.72/5  rDev +1.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Many thanks again to Mikey for providing a beer that I had only a sip of once before at EBF. 
The handbottle opened with a bit of sound, and poured near black with not much head formation, but left a spot or two of lacing. Dark tan ring around the edge of my glass. 
Smells phenomenal. Incredible job on the handbottle, Mikey. Even if there was oxidation present, it wouldn't even be able to whisper amidst the symphony of flavors going on here. Complex aromas of maple and marzipan. Coffee takes on almost a hazelnut flavor while still blending with clean, chocolate-covered beans. Sweet nuttiness and chocolatey nougat and almond biscotti with vanilla drizzle. The taste follows with these flavors and just a hint of alcohol in the finish, which is negligible in the grand scheme of the flavor profile. 
Canadian Breakfast Stout has low to medium carbonation, which has been well-preserved from this hand bottle. Extremely drinkable and just a very pleasant beer. I would drink this everyday if I could and hope that the rumored future batches are as exceptional as this one. 1,080 charactersIneedabeerhere, Dec 23, 2009
4.67/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Review from various notes and thoughts from trying this at EBF, around Philly a few times and recently at ChurchKey in DC. 
First off, I'm leaving my ChurchKey experience out of this since this beer on opening night there was oddly sour (and not the last beer I've had there that has been "off"). Appearance wise doesn't differentiate itself much from KBS, thick opaque black liquid with a thin deep tan/mocha head that fades quickly but leaves ok lacing. 
Aroma is very similar to KBS, but not as boozy or coffee forward. Dominated by sweet notes of vanilla, oak, maple, sugars, etc with a mild coffee background. The maple is as strong or noticeable as the vanilla or bourbon and oak aromas, or as expected going into the beer. That's not a bad thing, as I prefer this aroma over KBS. Mouthfeel is very nice, thick, chewy, low carbonation, not overly boozy, very silky smooth. Flavors are similar to KBS but a little sweeter from the maple and a little more mellowed out. All the same notes from the aroma and the finish lingers forever. In the end I still prefer the KBS for the stronger flavors and less sweetness, but this is a very complex and pleasing beer and hopefully this will continue to make regular appearances on tap. 1,234 charactersyourefragile, Dec 23, 2009
4.67/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Just another whip out of pure awesomeness at the epic Rush Hour Tasting I. This one also came thanks to Mikey711. 
A: Pretty thick as well, but not so much compared to the Black Tuesday we poured next to it. Pitch black color, some carbonation but not much, which can be forgiven coming from x week old growler. 
A: Sweet maple first hits the aroma, but it's very tame compared to what I thought it would be. Smokiness is the other big word on this one, lots of smoky aromas and roasted malts. A little boozy but not much. Some dark fruits, and quite a bit of porter-esque aromas of roastedness. Some coffee trickles our, but still light. A touch of oatmeal and chocolate round off the nose.
T: Pretty sweet again, but not overbearing. It has some maple taste, but again not too overpowering. An earthy stout taste comes out as well with lots more roasted malts and some coffee. Again more smoky flavors, that I believe some of it stems from the maple syrup, but there are probably some nice smoked malts as well. Some hops and bitterness cut through all that for a nice addition. It gives a bit of a chewy oat taste as well. Some malty flavors billow out as the taste warms bringing a lot of espresso and roast with it. Some semi sweet chocolate comes through late as well.
M: Pretty thick, but doesn't weigh your mouth down, with some carbonation (again due to growler). Almost velvety in the mouth but not completely.
F: Finishes slightly bitter from the stout charred malt flavor to the spicy hop addition. It also is semi sweet, which the sweetness up front on the taste has dried off quite a bit to a nice finish. More roast follows late, or hangs around at least, with a little more of the smoky flavors. Definitely a Canadian Breakfast in a bottle... er growler. Thanks again Mikey. 1,795 charactersjlindros, Dec 22, 2009

The color was as close to black as brown gets. 
Light brown head, with roasty/boozey/sweet aroma.
The taste was a sweet bourbony malt treat. This was consumed at a slightly elevated temperature so the flavors were perfect in my estimation. The maple was very present and intensefide as we neared the bottom.
This was very drinkable. 370 charactersyoubrewidrink, Dec 16, 2009
4.47/5  rDev -3.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4On tap at the Thirsty Monk in Asheville, before Brewgrass '09. Never thought I'd see it so far south! Exciting times, to be sure. Had this alongside a bottle of 09 KBS and a pint of Founder's own Breakfast Stout. It don't get much better than that. From coaster notes:
A. Looks like KBS, honestly. Quite dark, nearly black, with a deep red-brown head that is smallish. Thick and dangerous looking.
S. Hmm... this is a smoother, more rounded version of KBS. Delicious rich, sweet roast malt, coffee, chocolate, no real maple smell for me, alas!, but plenty of delicious woody vanilla notes, some booze, a rap to the nose. Everything here seems complementary and lush. Seems like a toned down version of KBS that's less bourbon-forward. I can deal, and in fact this smells wonderful.
T. Once again, this is a more rounded, smoother, subdued KBS, but I still ain't tasting maple, dadgumit! Massive amounts of toasted, roasted, burnt and blackened malt roll over the tongue, thankfully there is smooth malt sweetness to match the bitter and characterful roast. Coffee, cocoa, vanilla and wood (from the barrels), some dark fruit and hints of alcohol... but not as bold and tough as it's older bro. Still very good.
M. Thick, smooth, rich, medium-low carbonation, delightful mocha-roasty sweet finish.
D. Actually more drinkable in quantity than the Kentuck version. Not miles different. Would have preferred to actually taste the vaunted maple. I can't say I prefer Canadian Breakfast stout, but I did quite enjoy it. In the top 15 beers on BA? Nah... but this IS killer stout. Drink if ya can. 1,595 characterskkipple, Dec 16, 2009
4.68/5  rDev +1.1%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5On tap, poured into a mini-snifter.
A: jet black with a caramel colored thick foamy head and strong lacing. An extremely inviting beer.
S: a lot going on here- in a good way. some bourbony alcohol, but not too much, raisins, vanilla, maple syrup and just hints of pipe tobacco and coffee as it warms.
T: based on the aroma, I wasn't expecting the bold roasted coffee flavors I got with the first sip- I liked it though! definitely getting maple syrup and butterscotch with every sip. as I make my way to the bottom of the glass the sweet syrup and butterscotch jump ahead of the coffee. The boozy flavor, much like the aroma, is just right.
M: full bodied, silky smooth and creamy. this is a beer you want to hold in your mouth as long as humanly possible- I didn't want to swallow it!
D: Canadian Breakfast Stout is absolutely fantastic. Definitely among the top 10 beers I've had. Really glad I had an opportunity to enjoy this one. 939 charactersjhoban19, Dec 09, 2009
4.97/5  rDev +7.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Had the opportunity to enjoy this treat at Stoutday Sunday at Sheffield's. I started with a full pour served in a snifter, but found myself going back to samples which were obtained with the drink coupons.
A: Appearance is pretty much the same as BS and KBS. Black, viscous, thin tan head that doesn't really stick around long.
S: Wow! Where do I start with description? The front has loads of the barrel characteristics. Lots of vanilla, brown sugar, maple which then is met by the bold delicious coffee that Founders uses in their breakfast stouts. The coffee aroma is somewhat subdued in comparison to BS and KBS, but with so many things going on in this beer, the coffee is at the perfect level. Some chocolate on the finish. No noticeable alcohol content. 
T: The taste lives up to the promise of complexity and variety that the smell suggested. The maple character lends a sweetness that is not present in BS and KBS which seems to balance beautifully with the bourbon and coffee notes. I drank this side by side with a KBS, and found CBS to be much more mellow and balanced. Both are world class brews, but I prefer this one more due to everything being perfectly in balance. Lots of sweetness on the front with maple syrup, oak, vanilla, and chocolate with a finish of dark roasted coffee. This is the best beer I have ever tasted. Drinking a glass of this reminds me of having pancakes with maple syrup and a cup of coffee. The contrast between the sweet maple and the bold coffee harmonizes in to what I would consider a damn near perfect flavor.
MF: nice thick chewy body, low on the carbonation, everything good here
D: Following my full pour of this, I sampled other stouts that were available, but found my self coming back to this. Having it back to back with KBS along with some other great stouts, I realized this one is a stand out! I could drink loads more of this, unfortunately that is hardly possible. The 9.4% abv is nowhere to be found.
Notes: This is hands down the perfect beer for me. I loved KBS when it came out, but found the bourbon character to be a tad stronger than I would have liked. CBS has a toned down bourbon character, and as stated before, it is perfectly balanced. 2,213 charactershomebrew311, Dec 08, 2009
4.03/5  rDev -13%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4I drank this on tap into a snifter.
CBS pours a very dark black with no brown in the light with a very nice mocha colored head. The head is about a finger and super thick but is gone quickly. Lacing is ok.
The aroma is light chocolate and oak with a little vanilla. I didn't get any syrup here.
The taste is very sweet, almost way to sweet and now i know where the maple was hiding. It is prominent here with some bourbon and a coffee finish.
The feel is nice but too sweet to be drinkable.
I was very excited to drink this and I like it better than the KBS but to me this is way overrated. There are so many better beers let alone better RIS that no way this is deserving of a top 10 ranking. The rarity really must bump it up. 733 charactersjrallen34, Dec 07, 2009
3.99/5  rDev -13.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 3 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5I tried this side-by-side with KBS. It is an excellent pour, but alas, I'd have to say, I much prefer the KBS.
The maple syrup character makes this just a little too sweet. KBS is already fairly sweet, but this just kicks it up a bit too much. I also prefer the aroma of KBS, but then again, that's because I love bourbon. So if you are not a fan of overly boozy bourbon barrel-aged beers, you are probably going to love this.
All of the other complexities remain. This is a very good beer that I was happy to be able to try, but falls short of being "exceptional" in my opinion. 581 charactersPrinceDarren, Dec 07, 2009

Inky jet black liquid with a chocolate ice cream colored finger of head that sticks around for a while.
The nose is wet oak, bourbon, cocoa powder, vanilla, roasted coffee, dark malts. Where's the maple?
The taste follows the nose with some strong bourbon notes, lot's of wet wood, chocolate, vanilla, coffee and roasted malt. It finishes with a sugary sweetness that I take is from the maple.
Mouthfeel is soft, slick, and medium bodied with a low level of carbonation. I expected it to be a little more viscous.
I'm really happy I finally got to try this, but I do believe I enjoy KBS more. I'm not saying this beer wasn't delicious, but the hype factor totally killed it for me. The $10 pour was a little rough too. 746 charactersbeertooth, Dec 07, 2009

A: Served an angry jet black. Small, creamy, 1/2 finger of dark mocha/espresso crema colored foam perched on top quickly recedes to a tiny skim that isn't much of a lace leaver.
S: Heavenly aromas of bourbon, espresso, dark chocolate, wet barrel, maple, vanilla, and fudge brownies. Brown sugar, dark fruit, and molassas as well.
T: Exactly as above. Absolutely incredible!
M: The sweetness of the maple really helps to soften the bitter edges of the hops and dark chocolate (like found in regular Breakfast Stout). Sure there's some prickle, but it fits in with everything else now like a puzzle piece!
D: Well, it's about time! I've been fruitless in my quest to try this beer for the last six months, or so. This absolutely deserves all the hype that it receives! Absolutely masterful! 892 charactersGbVDave, Dec 07, 2009
4.85/5  rDev +4.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Had this a couple months ago but waffled on posting the review for reasons I don't know. I thoroughly enjoyed this brew but I wanted more maple. Minus the aftertaste, I'm not sure it's all that different from KBS.
Appearance- Pours black as oil with the same consistency. Not a lot of head formed but I gave it a very gentle pour. Almost no cap but a fairly decent collar and it leaves a hell of a lot of dirty brown lacing.
Smell- Wow, as advertised. Big on the vanilla right from the start. Lots of roasted coffee and cream with gentle whiffs of "Kentucky". The bourbon is a lot more mellow than I would have guessed but definitely for the better. Light notes of raw cocoa and bitter bakers chocolate round out the nose. This beer actually smells just like a vanilla Starbucks. A touch of maple syrup in the nose but it's extremely light and honestly not all that noticeable.
Taste- Big roasted chocolate and caramel malts give a gentle sweetness to start that slowly gives way to the gentle "Kentucky" Bourbon. The whiskey is more than present but very subtle. Oaked vanilla and dark cherries are present along with the coffee. The espresso and vanilla are very nice but not as dominate as the nose implied. Finishes bitter with a light maple syrup aftertaste and the slightest flavor of alcohol. Considering the 10% ABV, it's amazing how little you can taste. The maple honestly doesn't really shine until long into the aftertaste. It lingers and lingers, amazing.
Mouthfeel- Thick and velvety with a very full, creamy feel. Carbonation is very light and absolutely perfect.
Drinkability- Like its little brothers (KBS and Breakfast Stout) it's just a f'n phenomenal beer. It may have a tinge more sweetness than both but it's fairly minimal and really not that intrusive. I do wish it was a bit more different than KBS but that's my only minor complaint. Great shit! 1,872 charactersyounger35, Nov 25, 2009

4.72/5  rDev +1.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Opening night at Birch and Barley / Churchkey, special appearance by a white whale of a beer, Canadian Breakfast Stout from Founders on draft.
Served in a snifter, beer looks as you might expect. Black, thick, brown thin head carbonation low to moderate. Head leaves minimal lacing on the glass.
Aroma is very complex. There is a dominant aroma of cream or milk, with hints of wood, chocolate, sweet, some smoke, and a tiny sour note in there as well.
This is one of the most balanced and drinkable beers I have ever had. Seriously. Mouthfeel is good, not too thick, not thin at all. Flavors line up well with the aroma. The beer warmed a bit, probably around 50 - 55 degrees when I was drinking it. The cream flavors come through, in the back there is some, slight, roast, a good balance for sure. Lots of chocolate and some wood notes. 
This beer lived up to the hype for me. If you ever get an opportunity to try it, do it. Its amazing. 943 charactersdrabmuh, Oct 23, 2009
4.97/5  rDev +7.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5From notes 7-18-09
Eye: Exactly what you'd expect, thick and black. Tannish head, creamy and almost cascading even though no nitro is used on this one. At first when poured into my new "reviewing (pint) glass" the head collapsed and lacing sucks. When poured into my older glass-500 beers and only washed out with boiling water, I get a nice thick creamy light brown head and some pretty decent lacing. However, the head still falls to less than what it began at...retention and lacing could be could be a bit better, but thats bout it. 
Nose: Great stout quaility here. Lots of roasted notes and chocolate character here. Some ground coffee bean notes as well. Maple syrup notes in here too, faint but there. I think that if I didn't know to look for it I probably would not have even picked it up. Its very much in the background, but definitely there. Founders does it again, the name says it all, breakfast stout. 
Tongue: Chocolate notes, roasted flavors and coffee bean all come through in this beer. Theres some sweetness too in here, maybe its from the maple syrup barrel, can't be sure. Getting a dark fruit on the front of the tounge, maybe like raspberries or something like that, kinda reminds me of tart cherries. Almost like Bell's Cherry Stout in the way it comes through...but less specific and more generic. An overall perceived tartness on the front of the tongue, and its definitely from the yeast and not any fruit. Maple syrup flavor is in here, but for me, its hard to find, it mixes in there so well that its kinda hard for me to pick out. I mean there's a big difference between KBS, CBS, and just the Breakfast Stout. You'd definitely be able to tell them apart side by side. The more I think about it that fruitiness I get on the front of the tongue is from the maple syrup barrel. Fruitiness seemed the best way to describe it but once I look closer I think that its a maple syrup flavor. Definitely complex. 
Feel and Drinkability: Smooth and velvet like on the palate. Low carbonation is perfect for this one. Body is thick and heavy, slick on the palate. There is nothing I'd do to this beer to make it feel any better. I don't think that there's anything that could be done to make if feel any better. This one is easy to drink, its so damn good that each sip is as good as the previous, makes a beer like this very dangerous, but I like to live dangerously...haha...no but I do like the beers that are dangerous like this one. Flavor just lingers too, it stays with you for a while. I mean this is already my second growler. Now I did share the first one with some friends, but this one I filled today is all for me, it was too good for me not to review it, too good for me not to go back to. Such a great beer, I hope that this guy will end up in bottles at some point. Really one of the best Double Stouts I've had in a long time. Really quality, if you can get your hands on some then do so. Its well worth the 14.99 I paid for a growler. Actually I'd say its worth much more than that, making this a real good deal. 3,055 charactersbecktone, Oct 18, 2009
4.47/5  rDev -3.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5The used motor oil of 10,000 miles, that brown layer that lazily floats atop and settles down to an inky black in which you can see your reflection. The tradition, you know, the things our fathers taught us, long before we knew what it was like to fall in love... we knew how to mow the grass, change the oil, tinker, work on our lawnmowers and go-karts and whatever-it-was-you-had...
This aroma, though, unlike when Mom would say, "Ugh! You smell of gasoline! Go take a shower!" No, this one of rich espresso, woody maple, brown sugar and cream, light warm alcohol, and it somehow smells thick.
And so we would spend our saturdays chasing airplanes, or getting covered in black oil up to our elbows, and loving every minute, as we were learning how to be men, how to be just like Dad.
Those shots of thick espresso, the flavour of maple syrup on the morning's pancakes, the only meal Dad ever made on a saturday morning. And it may be chopping wood, the smell of a fresh oak log, or the night's fire and soft smoke, but this is different, Dad never had bourbon when I was young. The bourbon is in there in force, but softly balanced with the other aspects.
Thick and chewy, as natural motor oil should be, but this is a delicate monster of bourbon, maple, oak, and famous espresso. There are a few bubbles in there, though not many, just enough to give it an even more full-bodied impression on the palate. The oily-syrup slides down the throat and gives way to a warm, lingering bourbon note.
So take a moment, remember when you learned those things, the things that you can think back on fondly, the cold mornings or the hot days, the aroma of pancakes and maple-syrup when you woke up, or, if your Dad did smell like bourbon, of that. It's a delicious beer, one that well deserves to be highly sought after.

4 oz pour-
A: pretty basic looking. Like your typical Imperial Stout. Deep black with a small dark brown head. Looks good and thick.
S: wow, what a smell. At first it smelled strongly of coffee and bourbon with hints of maple and a bit of alcohol. After letting it warm it the smell totally changed. Everything mellowed and aromas of bitter chocolates with brown sugar and oak and some vanilla.
T: one word-amazing! All the things to describe the smell is exactly how I would describe the taste. Bitter sweet up front with a warming alcohol feeling on the way down. Got so much more amazing the warmer it got. I must say that drinking it closer to room temp is by far the best and only way to drink it.
M: thick, heavy, oily, warm
D: Very drinkable for the higher alcohol content. It was so smooth I could drink it all night.

A - Typical black. Very thin, dark tan head. Nothing tricky, but you can tell by looking at it that it is an imperial stout.
S - Honestly my favorite thing about this beer is the smell. The thick sugary, roasted malts. The maple syrup is apparent. A hint of alcohol in the wiff.
T - Syrup, thick roasted malts. Not near as much coffee as the original bkfst stout and not near as much alcohol burn as the Kentucky stout. This was a well balanced and well executed taste that is blended to perfection.
M - I do wish there was a touch more carbonation that was similar to Dark Lord, but this is my only minor complaint.
D - More please. I was only able to get 8 oz, but I would love for them to start bottling this. 812 charactersKCHopHead, Oct 02, 2009
4.29/5  rDev -7.3%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4served on tap @ Flying Saucer, Kansas City, MO
Pours a brown shade of brown that is all brown and looks brown. Seriously, it was pretty basic looking. It doesn't look like an imperial stout, not really. Its brown with reddish edges. The lion's-pelt head was small and didn't lace well at all. This beer is nearly a year old, so I guess I shouldn't be surprised. 
This needs to be a candle. Seriously. First up to tingle the nose senses is the familiar, well-executed espresso aroma from the standard Breakfast Stout (though not featured in the same level of strength as it is in FBS). Smooth vanilla works its way through the coffee as the beer quickly warms, eventually opening up to include the maple syrup that one looks forward to when having this beer. Some slightly sour wood scents provide a backbone to it all. Though not too complex, it smells great.
After the first swallow, the preeminent thought in my mind was that this beer isn't harsh at all. No trace of alcohol, no harsh whiskey barrel characteristics, no fusels finding their way up to the nostrils. This beer is smooth, smooth, smooth. I don't know what CBS tasted like fresh, but I'm attributing the smoothness to the nearly one year of aging. CBS has less coffee flavor than FBS but that's backed up by vanilla sweetness and rich, silky malts. The Canadian rye whiskey barrel flavors are delicious. I'm usually not in love with whiskey/bourbon/brown spirit flavors (in beer or otherwise), but this is simply the best brown spirit flavor in a beer that I've ever had. The balance is impeccable; this is a sweet beer, yes, but never cloying.
This aged pour of CBS was unquestionably thinner in mouthfeel than FBS (also consumed on-tap tonight). I missed the thickness, frankly, but given the increase in residual sweetness maybe the thinner feel is a good thing. Regardless, its definitely not a negative in any sense. Drinkability has to be scored well. Its high in ABV%, sure, but you always want more of this after the glass is finished. I sure wish that I could have had more.
I wasn't able to have very much of this great beer in what was my first, best and probably last chance to sample it. I'm so glad that I was able to drink what I did. Remarkable balance, tasty flavors, what's not to love? I haven't had Kentucky Breakfast Stout to compare, but its hard for me to see KBS being much better than its Canadian brother. 2,402 charactersReaper16, Oct 02, 2009

4.87/5  rDev +5.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.564 oz growler received in a trade with HopFu. The first one leaked in transit, but Austin was awesome enough to send a replacement. While it was still decent when flat and slightly oxidized, the second growler was phenomenal. This was enjoyed side-by-side with Kentucky Breakfast Stout and regular Breakfast Stout.
CBS appears pitch black in the glass, completely opaque, viscous and oily, with two fingers of nearly black head that retains well, though it leaves no lace as it settles.
The nose is dominated by dark roasted coffee upon first smell. As it warms the maple begins to reveal itself, subtle at first but stronger as the beer reaches room temperature. Dark chocolate, roasted malt and the slightest hint of alcohol are present beneath the coffee and maple goodness. While I wouldn't say this is one of the most complex stouts I've smelled, it's easily one of the best.
The taste is bittersweet up front, a beautifully expressed maple syrup flavor lending sweetness and contrasting the dark roasted coffee. Roasted malt provides a nice bitter backbone, and the sheer viscosity is impressive. KBS and BS seemed thin in contrast. The coffee flavor begins to take over mid-palate, leading into a bitter, semi-dry finish. As rich and sweet as this is, it never gets cloying, and this is coming from someone that doesn't like most sweet beer. Phenomenal stuff, I'm hugely disappointed that there are no plans to rebrew it. This beer is light years ahead of KBS. 1,470 characterslargadeer, Sep 20, 2009
4.1/5  rDev -11.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5This beer came an nondescript dark brown with a creamy tan collar on top. 
Smells of honey, milk chocolate, coffee and a deep, smokey campfire. Sadly, there's a significant boozy sting in the background. Otherwise, there's a great balance here.
Tastes not-so-surprisingly much like the Breakfast Stout with a bit of green grape, roasted sappy wood and a smokey coffee. The big difference here is that this one is heavier on the rye than the sweeter bourbon take. If you know your brown liquors, the substitution is pretty obvious, focusing more on sour, dryer grains which brings out a dry astringent woodiness. 
Feels slick and clean although dense with a light froth of CO2. 
Nice. A great take on the legend, but I must say that I vastly prefer the KBS. 760 charactersDarkerTheBetter, Sep 20, 2009
4.88/5  rDev +5.4%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Received by largadeer in a trade, and shared generously with us po' folk. Thanks Chris. 
The first growler leaked and lost carbonation, but I still felt it was a fantastic beer. The replacement growler was properly carbonated -- and with bubbles, this beer is mindblowing. 
A: Pours an opaque, oily black color with a huge inch of mocha-colored head. Retention is pretty poor, and within 30 seconds the bubbles are almost entirely gone. But it had terrific legs, and it coated the glass quite well when swirling. It was so viscous that my glass still looked brown after drinking. 
S: Black coffee, roasted malt, and dark chocolate. A subtle maple scent underneath it -- I was worried this characteristic would be too strong. Some brown sugar and molasses to be found. I know this was barrel-aged, but I had trouble identifying any oak. 
T: The taste starts off with a heavy coffee-forward flavor that is countered with maple. Someone on the forums described this as Breakfast Stout with a shot of maple, and that's an apt description. But it's not a strong flavor; it's more mellow than the bourbon in KBS (which we tried side-by-side), and does surprisingly well in a tasting filled with people who hate sweet beers. The mid-taste is mildly tannic with vanilla and a roasted malt component. The finish sees dark chocolate and molasses. I didn't taste the brown sugar I smelled. The finish is semi-dry and carries coffee into the aftertaste, but it's less coffee-forward than FBS or KBS (a good thing in my opinion). 
M: Surprisingly, for all the sweetness and richness, the beer doesn't get too cloying or syrupy. I had at least 10oz, I'd guess, and none of them bogged down on me at all. And it seems pretty well attenuated, so that helps. 
D: Wow, I'd love it if they would release this in bottles. This beer is just fantastic. 1,836 charactersArbitrator, Sep 19, 2009
4.32/5  rDev -6.7%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5On tap at Thirsty Monk, Asheville, NC
A-Deep, dark black with a thin tan cap that quickly reduced to a thin veil leaving zero lace.
S-Rich roasted malt, chocolate and a subtle maple sweetness that only becomes noticed with significant warming. Vanilla and oak notes pop in the background as well.
T-Vanilla sweetness and chocolate bitterness fight it out in a one on one death match! Various notes slide in as the brew warms with oak, coffee, maple, toffee and even turbinado. A complex brew that takes on different aspects with temperature change.
M-Full bodied, thick, rich and viscous. A velvety mouthfeel that slides down easy. Long lingering flavours.
D-Tasty stuff indeed. The maple flavour is not very prevalent but it does poke through here and there especially upon warming. A bit smoother than "standard" KBS and just as tasty in a different way. Another fine barrel aged breakfast stout from the folks at Founders. 930 charactersDeuane, Sep 18, 2009

Expected black beer... no light even when held to the bright kitchen overhead... dark tan head doesn't stick around ... descent cap.
Aroma is chocolate and coffee.. no real "maple syrup" and no vanilla... the "wood" aspect of it does remind me of the smell of maple wood... I know that sounds weird it is what it is.
Flavor has a great blast of roasty chocolate, but not as much coffee as I was expecting... much more vanilla than the nose... The above "maple wood" aroma is more pronounced than the nose... The body is pretty hefty with still a nice smooth carbonation that helps make this a very nice sipper.
Edit: I figured I had better describe the "maple wood" sensations I mentioned above... I can only make sense of it when I describe it to the Sonoran 100... that brew was filtered slowly through maple chips... The wood adds a unique sweetness that doesn't have the astringency/tannic notes associated with some wood aged beers.
I really wanted to like this one more, but it just seemed pretty one dimensional to me.
Thanks again Eric for going out of your way to bring this beer to Boise.... truly appreciated.... You're a good BA. :-) 1,302 charactersJohnGalt1, Sep 14, 2009

First person I had a trade set up with managed to break their growler. Second person sent me a flip top hand bottle, the bottle looked tampered with, and a box that was apparently shipped new looked like it had been opened and resealed. Well, third time's the charm, as I managed to get a fairly fresh handbottle to review.
Pours a dark black with deep brown edging. An inch or so of off-white foam (I thought high ABV brews couldn't be carbonated!)
Smells like vanilla, dark roasted malts, some chocolate, and coffee. I get no maple syrup in the nose.
Taste gives me some maple syrup ... maybe ... and some vanilla sweetness. Still it isn't as sweet as I expected. Mostly roasted malt, some chocolate, and thankfully, not as much coffee as I find distracting in the KBS and BS versions. I didn't think this was bourbon barrel aged, but I almost get a touch of oak and bourbon to it. The cocoa/chocolate rounds out a robust, but not overpowering, coffee profile.
Nice and thick, but not overpoweringly sludge-like.
Very good, but not quite upper echelon. 1,131 charactersOverlord, Sep 13, 2009

Arrived pitch black with a deep mocha head. A couple of crooked thin patches of lace, but not much, as expected. 
Nose: Bourbon, vanilla, sugar, subtle maple
Thick chewy mouth. Starts of boozey but quickly burnt coffee, chocolate, and candied sugar take over. Vanilla and bourbon reenter the picture along with some currant. Finishes smooth with maple and bourbon mixing. They were passing around bottles of the syrup that was aged in the same barrels, with some great local waffles. Dipped a waffle covered in maple syrup into the head of my 2nd glass, now that's whats for breakfast!
Thanks for Fatheads for bringing this in, and thanks to Founders for another wonderful brew. 724 charactersbeerphan, Sep 13, 2009

On tap at Fatheads as the finale to Founders weekend. Pours pitch black into a goblet, cocoa head, no lacing but it's a thick-ass stout so none expected. Just as a big stout should be. Anise, alcohol and, yes, maple in the nose. As it warms up the maple practically explodes. Thick and heavy mouthfeel, much like the artisan syrup that formerly inhabited the barrels in which this masterpiece was aged ( I had some of that too; if ever syrup was worth $50/bottle, this was it.). Sweet, malty flavor with residual bite. Coffee nature of the breakfast stout was subdued by the maple aging but not outright subjugated: call it a "mellowing." Nice finish. Drinkable as hell but only go for one - the second'll knock you on your ass.
Is it the 10th best beer in the world? No. Is is really fucking good and worth making a weekend of? Oh, yes. kudos. 896 charactersrabsten, Sep 13, 2009

A - Dark oily black body with a thin tan ring that quickly receded to an almost non-existent patch. 
S - Maple character is quite subtle, surprisingly. Vanilla presence, however, is not as meek. Same goes for chocolate. Some woody notes and hints of coffee also emerge. Overall, the nose is quite sweet yet subtle.
T - Lots of vanilla sweetness in the initial flavor, with an understated maple syrup presence. It's there, but it's quite restrained. Flavor is very chocolatey, caramely and sweet with hints of coffee beans, the latter of which adds a tinge of bitterness. Overall, the vanilla dominates the flavor.
M - Full bodied and thick with a rich, luscious texture and slick mouthfeel, which allows the liquid to literally glide down the throat with ease. Carbonation is pretty subtle and provides only a hint of prickle on the tongue. Finishes quite sweet on the palate. 
D - Don't get me wrong. CBS is a very good beer, no doubt about it. However, in the eschelon of Founder's Breakfast Stout brews, this is clearly on the bottom. While it is a fine brew in itself, it is the lesser Breakfast Stout, in my opinion. 1,157 charactersffejherb, Sep 06, 2009

Growler generously shared by largadeer (thanks, Chris!). I was really looking forward to trying this beer and annoyed him about it at every possible opportunity. Same growler that Arbitrator reviewed this from, and yes, it did leak in transit and lose a substantial amount of beer, so the packaging materials were lucky enough to sample quite a bit of this rare brew. I knew from the start this was right up my alley since I love imperial stouts, coffee, and maple syrup. I could probably take almost anyone in a Super Troopers style syrup bottle chug.
Growler poured into snifter.
A - Black and viscous with the tiniest bit of brown foam when agitated. Clung to the side of the glass when swirled.
S - Coffee, roast, maple syrup, and a tiny bit of alcohol. Very inviting.
T - I've heard you can drop a tablespoon of maple syrup into a Breakfast Stout and approximate this beer pretty closely closely. CBS is a little fuller-bodied and more viscous, but as far as taste goes, that is a very good approximation. Flavor is lots of bitter coffee that is very reminiscent of regular Breakfast Stout, roasted malt, dark chocolate, maple syrup, vanilla, and a faint hint of oak. Alcohol is detectable but very well-hidden. This beer is really well-rounded and succeeds in balancing the sweetness from the syrup and malt with the coffee bitterness.
M - Well, because of the shipping mishaps, the amount of carbonation was somewhere between really, really, ridiculously low and Angels Share - i.e. it was damn near flat. Surprisingly, that didn't matter much. Call me crazy, but I like it when a syrup beer has a syrup-like mouthfeel. That's exactly how this was. CBS is smooth and viscous on the way down and lingers on the palate afterwards.
D - This is incredibly drinkable for an imperial stout. The second I put the glass down, I was thinking about my next sip. It just keeps you wanting that mapley, coffeey (not even close to being a word, I know) goodness and almost makes you cry when it's gone and you know you'll probably never try this again.
Founders, I can't stress this enough, please brew this beer again. If I could have a keg of this stuff delivered to my apartment once a month, I would be a very happy, drunk, and fat person.
UPDATE 9/19/09: largadeer got a new growler that was perfectly hermetically sealed, and it was PHENOMENAL. Huge lasting tan head with great retention and lacing. Flavor is just incredibly complex with a lot (but not too much) of maple syrup. Nice lively mouthfeel. This destroyed both KBS and regular BS in a side-by-side. This is flat-out one of the best beers I've ever had. 2,676 charactersnickd717, Sep 01, 2009
4.47/5  rDev -3.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Served on tap at Capones
Pours a oily complately opaque black color with a .5 finger chocolate coffee colored tan foam head that slowly dissipates into a thin ring and cap that lasts throughout. Very minimal splotches of lacing.
The maple is pretty prominent in the aroma balancing out the strong bourbon alcohol presence of the KBS. There is a nice roasted coffee presence that's accompanied by some chocolate malt, toffee, burnt toast, caramel and a healthy dose of bourbon.
The mouthfeel of this beer is silky smooth due to the additional aging in the maple barrels. The high ABV is extremely well masked even with the strong bourbon presence. All of the other roasty and malty flavors are balanced out by this sweet honey, molasses-like syrupy texture. This beers is ridiculously quaffable considering all that's going on and the high alcohol content.
As mentioned above, there are a lot of complex flavors going on here. Nice big roasty coffee presence, chocolate, chocolate malt, toffee, oatmeal, burnt toast and a very nice bourbon presence all wonderfully balanced by the sweet maple syrup flavor coming from the additional aging. 
I could drink this beer all day and I'm looking forward to trying it again soon. 1,225 characterscorby112, Aug 28, 2009
4/5  rDev -13.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Consumed on 08/26/2009 and poured into a snifter. I have a benevolent ghost from the east to thank for this. The beer is ebony with a small light brown head. Scattered lacing clings to my Darkness glass when the head recedes.
The aroma is immediately black coffee, roasted malt, and dark chocolate. Molasses is strong, and some vanilla is noticeable. Maple becomes evident as the beer warms, but it's not as strong as I was expecting. The coffee and roasted character seem to overshadow the maple in the nose. Other aromas are of oak and alcohol. 
The flavor opens up with...well, black coffee. The coffee is fine, but wasn't maple supposed to be a big part of this beer? Isn't KBS a coffee beer? What about the maple?! Black strap molasses is present, as well as a strong roasted malt character. Dark chocolate is evident, and though the maple isn't strong it's more potent here than it was in the aroma, imparting a subtle sugary sweetness. The finish is dry and of bitter roasted coffee.
The beer is full bodied with low carbonation and a full, viscous, and sticky mouthfeel. This is a good beer, but I was expecting more maple character considering its purported presence. I believe regular Breakfast Stout to be superior. 1,229 charactersHopHead84, Aug 27, 2009
4.75/5  rDev +2.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5On tap yesterday at Teresa's Next Door. WTF is this beer doing in the top 10?
A: Jet black with a dark brown head with excellent retention, it hangs around until after I'm done drinking this! Plenty of lace.
S: Plenty of coffee with a rich maple syrup sweetness. Rich and decadent with dark chocolate, and mild vanilla. I really like the fact that the maple character is an accent, instead of a driving flavor. Excellent stuff. While having no semblance of balance, this is still pretty great on the nose.
T: Opens bitter with coffee followed by sweet maple syrup before a dark chocolate bittersweet character comes through. Rich and tasty with the combination of chocolate, coffee and maple being good. Bittersweet on the finish with (more ) maple and chocolate. As it warms up, the maple character grows, and the beer becomes a little less enjoyable
M: The m/f is excellent. Creamy, full bodied and mildly carbonated, this beer is quite great on the palate. The finish is pretty good, but as the beer warms up and maple character grows, it does drop off.
D: I did enjoy one glass of this, but was physically incapable of drinking more. Not because it was a bad beer or cloying, but the combination of a warm bar, plenty of other good beers, and a good brunch curbed my urge for another glass.
Edit 23 Oct 2009:
I drank this again last night at the Church Key opening and found it to be quite hugely different. The coffee was lower in the mix, with an absolutely stellar blend of maple syrup, coffee, chocolate and bourbon. Exceptionally balanced, this is noted on the palate too. The finish is an excellent contrast between a coffee bitterness (and almost an espresso-like tartness) with the maple and bourbon. I drank about 5 glasses of this, truly wonderful stuff.

Poured into a tulip glass and had nice dark appearenace with small tan head. Gave off a sweet aroma, but not overpowering. Good balance of carbonation and flavor. It's impossible to write about this beer without comparing it to Kentucky Breakfast Stout. CBS finishes with a sweet aftertaste probably from the maple syrup wheras KBS finishes with a strong alcohol flavor. This makes CBS much more drinkable in my opinion. 470 charactersdwaz, Aug 24, 2009

A-Pours a deep black with a thin white head and no lacing. Very nice.
S-Maple syrup and vanilla notes combined with a nice roasted malt.
T-Light maple and vanilla, roasted malt and a moderately bittersweet finish. Is that all there is? I thought it might get more interesting as it warmed but it didn't.
M-Medium bodied, just a little rich.
D-Very nice. A huge disappointment based on expectations, though. We poured a KBS side by side about half way through. This was no match on any front. I like regular Breakfast Stout better also, as the coffee flavor is largely masked here. A nice beer but not a Top 100 beer to me.
UPDATE: Tried this yesterday at Teresa's Next Door and tasted a totally different beer. Less maple dominated, a bit boozier, but in a good way, richer in body and deeper in flavor. I have revised the T, M and D factors up. This is still, IMO, wildly overrated and still the least good of the three variations of Breakfast Stout. But yesterday I could almost get what others saw. I hope your experience with this beer is more like my second than my first.

A: A dark brown almost black thick liquid with almost no head on the pour. No glass lacing.
S: I got the maple smell immediately and noticed how much swetter the nose was than the KBS. Also smells of roasted coffee and dark chocolate.
T: The maple syrupy taste comes out first in the sweetness of the beer. Sweet maple with caramel malt get pushed aside by the roasted coffee/espresso flavors with dark chocolate flavors and a hint of vanilla, oak and some bourbon. A slight hop tinge is felt but the sweetness of the maple comes back in at the end to finish out. This is really a complex beer that needs to be drank a bit warmer to open it up. Alcohol heat comes in at the end too.
M: Full, coating, sweet with a decent alcohol kick. Very smooth though.
D: Medium at best. This one was just a tad bit sweet for me. 
I have drank a fair amount of the Breakfast Stout line from Founders, so for me there is no question I tasted the maple right up front. Others seemed that they could not really taste it, I for sure could. This is a solid beer, but for me the KBS is much better. I love KBS so much and for me is the perfect blend of sweet and roast. This one bends a bit more on the sweeter side, not my bag. Still a very good beer that is rare as hell and I'm extremely happy I got to try it. 1,509 charactersKadonny, Aug 17, 2009

Appearance: Dark and opaque with little head.

Taste: This is why it was worth the trip. Opens malty and sweet and transitions to a dark chocolate in the middle. From the middle to the end I get coffee, woody and subtle hints of vanilla, leaving an earthy and sweet aftertaste.

4.43/5  rDev -4.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Enjoyed a 9oz. snifter at Capone's CBS event Saturday. Started a little too cold, so warmed up in the hands over 30 minutes. 
Nice appearance - small tan head so they could pack as much in the glass as possible, sitting atop a deep brown/black body. Minor lacing.
Worked a bit to get the smell going (temperature), but was primarily a roasted espresso, and a touch of sweetness - bittersweet chocolate and vanilla. 
Taste was much more pronouced than the smell, and the roasted malt and espresso qualities dominated, without being the least bit bitter. The sweet maple flavor was tame, but you can tell it really helps level things out. I guess I was expecting "more waffle, less coffee", but the reverse worked well.
MF started very creamy smooth - like a goose-down pillow in a glass, and then puts the breaks on gently with a slightly acridic bite. This aspect was the real winner for me here. 
Very, very drinkable - in fact, I continued with two other imperial stouts after this one. 993 charactersBeerImmediately, Aug 17, 2009

I arrived at Capone's with my brother at approximately 10:15 a couple people back in line after akorsak (review below). They had beers poured and ready for tasting when we sat down anticipating the demand - kudos Capone's. I am very glad I got to try this great beer again. Here goes 888.
Look -5 Smell -4.5  Taste -5 Feel 4.5 Overall 5
Served chilled in a small snifter.
A - Ebony, opaque like an 8ball with 1/2 inch of almond capping. The bubbles appear thick and the bead is averages, with generally good lacing
S - The smell is like music to my nose - chocolate covered coffee beans, maple, bourbon soaked stone fruit and vanilla. The nose is so complex with mild caramel and nuts w/ mild alcohol accent from the bourbon. The cocoa presence and complimentary maple and bourbon really drive the aroma
M - Viscous without being syrupy or cloying w/ sweetness in the texture a mild alcohol up front. The roasted feel takes a backseat and some fruity, sappy textures propel the middle toward coffee-like roasty notes w/ bitter residual feel w/ mild woody astringency
T - Creamy smooth roasted coffee and maple synergy leads into a fine bourbon back w/ vanilla and maple flavors that mingle. As I paused to let the liquid sit in my mouth the roasted elements of cocoa and coffee settle and the character becomes mildly tannic w/ acidity of coffee and the creamy oaky vanilla taste saturates the sweet maltiness. The finish is very bourbon influenced with a mild hop accent
D - Not as maple as I expected but just as KBS masterfully blends all of the elements together-so is the case w/ CBS, a delight. The stout is well layered and complex enough to savor for a length of time as the combination of maple and stout are so complimentary, magic for the taste buds.
I recently had this on tap again after 5 years of my first try  reviewed above.
It looks a little less nice than I remember -head retention is not as good. The smell is great and has plenty of coffee and maple. The taste seems sweeter than before and feel less smoothly blended. 
Overall I like this a lot -not really deserving of my top 10 of all time beers considering I kept going back to KBS while having it side by side and seemed to like that better still excellent and just as good as any of the stouts in Founders repertoire to me. 2,342 charactersSlatetank, Aug 16, 2009

s: Fairly mild aroma overall. I got notes of coffee and a little chocolate even when it was cold. As it warmed, vanilla, oak, and some sugary maple candy emerged. Very good, but I was hoping for something more potent.
t: Plenty going on in the flavor department, I'm just not sure that it all works together. Upfront I tatsed fairly strong chocolatey coffee. Sweet elements of vanilla and those maple leaf shaped candies you buy in gift shops in maple syrup producing regions close things out. The finish was pretty sugary for my taste, but as it warmed some oak flavors came out that helped quite a bit. Unique and well crafted for sure, but the flavors just didn't fit well together.
m: Thick, chewy, and gently carbonated. Close to perfect and exactly what I expected from Founder's.
d: I did enjoy this, but even if I see this again, I doubt I'd order it. Nothing off with this one, the coffee and the maple sugar flavors just don't go well together. 1,080 charactersDIM, Aug 15, 2009

Very dark brown, close to black, with a coffee colored head that holds well and laces the side of the glass. 
Very nice aroma, roasted coffee beans and chocolate, caramel sweetness, hints of wood and vanilla, dark fruits. 
Full bodied and creamy, and flavor follows suit, but it is better balanced than their other "breakfasts", with more roasted beans and chocolate notes, and less intense coffee.

Smell was strong coffee with light hints of wood and maple syrup. Taste was fresh brewed coffee with an extra sweetness from the maple, although I can't say I could have pointed out that it actually was maple if I didn't know already. This is like a slightly less boozy, slightly sweeter version of KBS. Overall, I found to to be almost equal to that beer. This is a full bodied beer, but not quite what I would call creamy, and I was left wanting more and more. I can't say I find this to be any more exciting than KBS though. 617 charactersalcstradamus, Aug 09, 2009

Pitch black, pours like engine sludge with a heavy finger of dark brown head. Some spotty lacing speckles the pint as the glass disappears. Espresso beans, woodsy oak, fine chocolate and alcohol are all right up front. I just wanna sit and smell it. Belgian chocolate, espresso, more oak, black currant, and plums are all present and accounted for in the taste. Some dryness from the oak tannins. Rich and chewy, some lingering bitterness, think espresso. This is a very enjoyable sipper, not too sweet. Honored to be able to savor this beer. 651 charactersbrokenleadedcask, Aug 09, 2009
4.65/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A modest 8 ounce pour yields a chocolate brown head that is only a skim, rather typical for a tap pour of this sort. Body is a dirty rusty blackish brown that really looks like used motor oil thickness. Nose is still very coffee dominant with only hints of vanilla and bourbon. Maple is only in the background like fresh pancakes with a bit of syrup on top. Oh so sweet and smooth as you take first sip. Bourbon isn't as evident as KBS as a vanilla character comes into play and almost a creme brulee coffee sweetness is developed. Wonderful desert like sweetness is soft yet rich and bold while it paints a very thick coating feel on the tongue. Wonderfully drinkable brew that is nectar with it's tasty sweetness. 715 charactersSPLITGRIN, Aug 04, 2009

Finally get to try this, BOY am I psyched. I've been spoiled this year after attending the KBS release and having 2 cases to work through. But I didn't get the chance to try CBS at the release and I can finally stop kicking myself!
@ Beer Engine. Poured in a cute 8-10oz souviner glass coffee cup. Great creamy head smells like we have a winner.
Taste was absurdly perfect. Great roast - a bit more than KBS, nice chocolate tones and a residual sweetness from the maple to balance out the bitterness of the beans. The whiskey kick in this is second to none. Side by side with KBS it becomes apparent which wins the battle for stout supremacy. Mouthfeel is creamy and freakn' perfect. I had 3, so drinkability was in an unheard-of zone for such a dark and strong beer.
I'm starting to question if I can continue to live in Cleveland after drinking this. Grand Rapids may be the luckiest city in the US to have this on for many days each year.
Right now, it's 4:13 EST. Michagan still sucks, but their beer...oh man, their beer!!!!
A++ offering, great job Founders!! 1,076 charactersjampics2, Aug 02, 2009

4.03/5  rDev -13%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Served way too cold so we had to wait a bit, sipping KBS till it warmed up. Rich black color, just a wisp of light brown foam. 
Smell is mild with bits of caramel and just a hint of maple once it warms up enough.
Taste is rich and roasty, especially in the finish. Bits of chocolate and slight coffee show up. A very lingering dark roast makes this different than KBS. Not overly sweet and the alcohol is well hidden. 
Not too dense; rich and creamy. 
I had three pours, 2 paid for by the Founders rep Mike Bell, who bought the first round for the whole house! 560 characterskirok1999, Jul 31, 2009
5/5  rDev +8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured out of a growler courtesy of Jcb890. I wish there was a procedure to replace my blood with this beer. It is epic. Pours as any stout should. Jet black color with a dark tan head. Head retention is good as a thin layer of foam remains throughout the glass. Vanilla, coffee, caramel and a sweet maple aroma dominate the nose. The taste is incredible. Very complex beer that gets better as you get deeper into the glass. Starts off with vanilla/caramel sweetness. The coffee notes come through in the middle, followed by a bit of booziness. The maple comes through at the finish, although it's mixed with a nice roasted character. This is one of the smoothest beers I've had the pleasure of drinking. Almost a creamy quality to it. After taking a sip it seems like it coats the tongue. Despite being a stronger ABV it is surprisingly drinkable. All said and done, this is probably the best beer I've had to date. If you ever have a chance to try this, please do it, even if you have to drive to Africa. 1,006 charactersreginaldo, Jul 26, 2009

A - Pours an almost pitch black with about an inch or so of a dark brown head. Lacing has stuck around for the entire glass.
S - A very sweet smell with a lot of maple, vanilla and oak.
T - Delicious! Oh man do I love this beer. I've been missing this since I tried it at the Extreme Beer Festival. A lot of maple here in the taste with some coffee. Imagine Breakfast Stout with lots of amazing maple.
M - Very smooth and rather thick. Leaves a nice coating on the mouth after sipping.
D - This growler will be gone very shortly after this review is finished. I wish I could bathe in it!
If you can get this beer, please, for the love of all that is holy, do it! I think this is honestly the best beer I have had to date (in my opinion). It is absolutely amazing.

4.89/5  rDev +5.6%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Coincidentally(or not) my brother needed a ride up to boston and I graciously agreed to provide this service as the CBS was on tap at the Roadhouse. I looked at the beer menu to make sure I wasn't dreaming and made my decision. The bartender remarked that I made an excellent choice as the keg was nearing the end. The CBS could no longer elude me.
I received a glass with the jet black beer and its dark brown head. It was syrupy thick lacy and begging me to drink it.
I stuck my nose in to some maple syrup, coffee, vanilla, and bourbon aromas. Each aroma was distinct yet together. As the beer warmed one of these aromas would dominate before giving way to another.
The first sip was great the expected flavors were there. Coffee and cocoa upfront vanilla and maple syrup in the finish. Mild booziness. Agai at different temperatures a certain flavor would dominate but at no point was it overwhelming.
Very full bodied and velvety smooth. Had I had more time I think I could have enjoyed way to many of these. I kept thinking of the KBS during this drinking experience and how I would love a side by side tasting. The problem with this beer is founders may not make it again which would truly be a shame. 1,212 charactersmikey711, Jul 25, 2009

Good beer, the best of the Breakfast Stout series Founder's has released. That said, it isn't a great beer, and certainly not one of the top ten beers in the world. I have always felt that limited, on-tap only releases tend to hype beer and inflate scores. This is a good example of that theory in action. 630 characterscraytonic, Jul 23, 2009
4.5/5  rDev -2.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5The description of this beer goes like this, "Founders Breakfast Stout aged in Kentucky whiskey barrels that were also used by a small maple syrup maker. The beer is then aged underground in the town's local mine. Maple & whiskey soaked wood, Sumatra and Kona coffee beans breakfast stout. Damn. What else can you say?". Sound amazing? It was.
This beer was presented in a stemmed glass. It was dark as night black, almost like cold espresso with a thin, very coffee-colored head.
The aroma is almost heavenly. Lots of dark roasted coffee beans, definite kick of whiskey and the alcohol notes are very apparent, sweet iced coffee with cream, molasses/caramel but alas no maple that I could detect.
The first sip is one of those "holy sh*t" moments a beer lover always hopes for. An immense rush of deep, dark bitter coffee is followed by a smooth, whisky flavor that envelopes everything and almost gives it an "iced Irish Whisky character flavor. Its very complex, the layers are many. There are hints of caramel, molasses and vanilla. Iced caramel macchiato? The barrel aging leaves this one with a dry, yet sweet finish.
The mouthfeel is very, very smooth, almost silky and creamy.
Overall, it is delicious. Does it get anymore amazing than a beer that was aged in a mine in barrels that held both whisky and maple syrup? Unbelievable stuff. There are layers of flavor and the last two to three sips probably could have their very own review. I feel privileged and lucky to have had a glass. 1,499 charactersindiapaleale, Jul 23, 2009

Served in a smallish goblet type glass. Stout black appearance with a small and tight dark brown head. Malty nose of coffee beans, chocolate, with a hint of whiskey. This beer is so well rounded. I'm pleasantly surprised that it's not too sweet - just a nice melding of strong flavors. A bit of vanilla and oak accent a deep rich and roasty malt base with a nice subtle presence of maple and a hearty smack of whiskey flavor. Deep leather flavors and almost smoky. Soft velvet on the palate - just uber smooth and soft. So delicious. Hard not to take giant gulps of this, as it's highy quaffable despite the booze. I might like this better than the Kentucky. A real treat for sure. 774 characterstwelvsies, Jul 22, 2009

Inky, murky dark brown body with a small, light khaki brown head. Good retention and lacing. Rich nose of smoky, roasted malts, semi-sweet chocolate, caramel, vanilla latte, and sugary fruits/maple syrup. Very nice. 
Moderate roasted barley and coffee notes up front. Sweet mixture of dark fruits, toffee, vanilla, and molasses take over. Light smoky twang throughout. Full-bodied, thick creamy feel into the finish. Finish is the most maple syrup-affected part of this beer and it works very nicely. Reminiscent of KBS, but minus the bourbon, and plus the sweetness. Delicious and would buy a case of this if it were ever bottled. 678 charactersalexgash, Jul 21, 2009

S: Vanilla with a slight bourbon smell going on. Very pleasant and inviting. 
T: The taste reminds me a lot of the KBS. I taste coffee, vanilla, and chocolate. A slight maple taste comes through towards the end. Hoppy a little also. The taste of this beer is unbelievable, every beer should taste like this.
M: Medium-full bodied. Feels perfect in the mouth. Like an aged stout should.
D: This style of Breakfast Stout seems to flow better than original Breakfast Stout but just as good as KBS.

T: A noticeable whiskey character, but less than in the smell. Earthy with flavors of burnt coffee and vanilla. The use of Canadian whiskey barrels instead of bourbon is apparent in a sweet tang on the palate.

A. Pitch Black. First glass had a slight dark brown head on the top that stuck to the side of the glass. The second was nearly a third head, but the keg was nearing the bottom.
S. Great, but not amazing. Bourbon, chocolate, coffe as would be expected
T. The taste is incredible. Very sweet initially that twisted to a bourbon/coffee flavor towards the bottom of the glass as it warmed. Very refreshing on a warm day and I was sad when my glass was empty.
M. Smooth, but couldn've been slightly thicker.

Poured out of a jockey box into a plastic disposable cup (I can't complain because it was about 10 oz for $5) Came out a thick black with very dark colored head. I got seconds right as the keg was running out and got a half cup of head, but I'm jotting that down to getting one of the last glasses.
Smell was mainly of coffee and I thought understated for such a big beer. Slight bourbon smell as well.
OMG the taste is amazing. Much smoother and sweeter than regular breakfast stout or KBS. I wish I'd brought bottles to do a side by side but the KBS bourbon taste is very bourbon forward, this was much more subtle. I could tste the maple in the esweet smoothness, but not as heavy as I thought it would be. I had to get seconds because I wasn't paying atention and downed my first glass without knowing it. 
Very easy drinker for an imperial stout, it was served outside and it was about 80-85 degrees out and it was still refreshing.
This was awesome, one of my top five beers ever. I want to drive to Michigan and hijack any they might have left. 1,090 charactersdegerbah, Jul 15, 2009

M = Not quite the mouth of the regular Breakfast Stout, which is the pinnacle IMO. But very nice and thick, coating. Just not quite as chewy as the original.

The bartender was pretty awesome and knowledgeable and told me this one was tasty and she even compared it to the Kentucky Breaksfast Stout for me since this was my first time having it :) The appearance was pitch black with a nice big tan head. The head pretty quickly went down to almost nothing within a few minutes. Despite this happening it still left some, not much, but some lacing down the sides of the glass. Looks very good. I didn't get to much out of the aroma but from what was there it was some coffee and some chocolate as well as some roasted malts. Could have been just me but all the smell was pretty faint and not there but for what was there it was good, like I said was probably just me. The taste, oh my god! Pretty much incredible. Lot's of chocolate in the taste which I wasn't expecting but it was quite the pleasant surprise. There was also some coffee present and some roasted malt. I could also pick up on the bourbon/whiskey flavors and the oak, very nice. The taste was incredible. I've only had the regular Breakfast Stout which was extremely great but this one was amazing! Pretty thick mouthfeel which was just perfect. Drinkability was high especially considering the high ABV and the alcohol was hidden so well. I went in knowing they had this on tap only to have one and ended up drinking three it was so delicious. By far one of the best beers I've ever had. The regular Founder Breakfast Stout was amazing enough but this one, wow, I could drink this every day all day. Like I said, one of the best I've ever had! 1,627 charactersdismal, Jul 08, 2009

A - black with a perfect coffee-brown head...looks beautiful
S - The nose contains heavy burnt malts and dark chocolate with a touch of molasses
T - Wow. It took me a while to figure out all what is going on in there. Starts off with the roasted malt being the most dominating taste. As it warmed a bit, sweet molasses and chocolate tones became noticeable adding a nice sweetness to counterbalance the roasted malts. I also got a lot of bourbony vanilla from the bourbon throughout the finish, which added a nice touch. There is also a bit of alcohol burn on the finish, which is what I expect from something aged in whiskey barrels to have. Also got a lot of maple bourbon on the exhale. This is a beautiful harmony of everything I love about dark, rich stouts.
MF - smooth and goes down nicely. Medium body...I wish it was a tad more full.
D - This was an excellent beer-it is so rich it has to be a sipper. I couldn't have asked for anything more. This was a delicious treat and I am very glad I was able to try it. 1,085 charactersbirchstick, Jul 04, 2009

Served a little on the cold side, which probably took away from the appearance and smell categories. Poured black and syrupy with a thin light brown head that dissipated fairly quickly. The thin head left a sticky lacing on the side of the glass. Aromas were weak, but pleasurable - coffee, vanilla, and bourbon mainly. Mouth-feel was incredible! Thick and syrupy with balanced carbonation providing excellent coverage of the palate. tastes were complex and delicious as well - sweet like fresh honey with notes of coffee, bourbon, vanilla, molasses. The maple was slightly present, but not as bold as I anticipated, which actually aided this beer to be more subtle and smooth in comparison to KBS. Also finished sweeter and more complete in comparison to its counterpart. What a treat to have tried this rare gem! Absolutely world class! 880 charactersbarnzy78, Jun 27, 2009

T: WOW! Fresh sweet maple syrup up front, rich, bold, sweet good. The bourbon shows up in the middle. It does not overpower which I like because it lets the maple shine. Vanilla seems to meld right into the maple. The finish a bit of fresh coffee comes out with just a touch of chocolate. Very Very Very complex.

Arrives in a snifter a deep dark pitch black with a small dark tan bubbly head on top that leaves some lacing behind. Aromas open up as the beer warms with deep chocolate and lots of dark malts. Fresh coffee lies underneath along with mellow oak. The maple syrup sweetness shines through more and more as it gets warmer and adds a really nice twist.
First sip brings big dark malts upfront with a tasty mix of chocolate, mellow coffee and maple syrup sweetness. Oak barrel accents swirl in with vanilla and just a kiss of bourbon. Sweetness lingers on through the finish along with a maple syrup afterthought. Smooth and tasty!
Mouthfeel is rich and creamy with a nice smoothness and mellow carbonation. Goes down pretty damn easy considering and doesn't have the strong bourbon kick of KBS. I wish I could have got more than one glass but the keg blew in an amazing 15 minutes. A great brew by Founders and I hope to run across it again someday. 985 charactersorbitalr0x, Jun 27, 2009

Not a drop of light peeking out at all and a nice, small, compact head of tan crept over the side for just a moment before falling back down and leaving some decent lacing on the glass. Big aroma here, absolutely huge. Very sweet notes, maple, lots of cocoa and hints of coffee and vanilla and very well put together. As it warms bourbon like smells start to come through with nice touches of vanilla really starting to come to the forefront here. Amazingly complex as the subtle maple hints start to find themselves along side blackstrap molasses. As I go in for a sip, I have to admit I am somewhat scared, and at the same time, cannot wait to try it. Rich molasses and maple notes hit first. Soothing, coating, and very filling. Bourbon then rides by, letting you know to take it easy and dropping touches of vanilla along the palate as it goes. Some subtle dark chocolate notes, meld with a hint of coffee, and now we are fully onboard with this one. Long finish is very sweet with the last gasp of maple and vanilla leaving me looking for my next sip.
Overall this was every bit the beast I thought it would be. I will be honest as I thought the maple would be a bit stronger, but in looking back I think it was nearly perfectly placed. This is a great thing they have done here. Taking one of my favorites and making it irresistible. I would have no issue at all with going for this one again any day. 1,745 charactersmikesgroove, Jun 27, 2009
4.85/5  rDev +4.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5On tap at Redbones in Somerville, MA
Looks like any good stout - Viscous, tarry black with a low, mocha head. Lacing sticks well after the beer is gone. Heavy, robust nose like a chocolatey burboun with vanilla beans squeezed in. Definite alcohol presence, but oozing with dark notes. Tastes phenomonal and rich. Loads of gooey chocolate, pleasant coffee notes with cream laced with vanilla syrup. Quite sweet, the vanilla is nearly candy-like in a delicious way. High hops bitterness and a nice earthy, woody flavor - it's surprising how well they blend with the malt and adjunct flavors. The smooth, creamy rich body is the best thing about this beer. Medium carbonation gives just enough lift to the thick body to keep it from being cloying - rich and heavy. The alchohol comes through, this isn't fooling anyone, but it's so rich, so flavorful, so creamy smooth and so delicious that I could drink it all day. 
One of the best balanced, most divinely flavourful beers I've ever had. This falls in the (very select) class of beers that I could drink all day, every day in place of any others. 1,097 charactersBiereBlanche, Jun 26, 2009

4.85/5  rDev +4.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5After hearing so much about this beer, a sixtel miraculously made it to Pittsburgh.
A: Poured into a dark black brown. Poured cold. Cold enough to make the glass fog up. Nice creamy tan head that stuck and laced the glass.
S: Very intense with chocolate liquor, sweet molasses, sweet maple syrup, sweet caramel and nice bitter roast. The sweetness outweighs the roast, but both smell in perfect complement.
T: The breakfast stout and Kentucky breakfast stout are phenomenal. But this is a touch above both. It reminds me of half breakfast stout, half Kentucky Breakfast stout, combined with a shot of bourbon and a shot of maple syrup. A tad sweet, but not overly so. Nice and creamy with chocolate, bitter roast, coffee and maple syrup.
Overall, a fantastic beer that I am glad I tried and will probably never get to try again. One of the best I've ever had. 863 characterstreyrab, Jun 22, 2009
4.78/5  rDev +3.2%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5I was so excited to hear that this was on tap at the Sunset in Boston. A big shout out to Jctribe25 (Patrick) for giving me the high sign on the availability. Thanks man!! Having a concern that the beer would not last until Sunday, I made a bee line to the Sunset yesterday afternoon to secure a pint. I arrived just in time and literally the keg kicked as they finished pouring my glass. In fact, the bartender was so cool, he pulled off some more out of the keg and gave us a bonus. This was one of my favorite beers at last winters Extreme Beerfest, so I was quite excited to get a crack at a full serving. The great news is that it was as good/if not better, than I had remembered. Believe the Hype.
Thick tan head that is aggressive and show quite a bit of structure.. Lacing sticks everywhere and is about as thick as I've seen. The beer itself is the color of espresso and is a very deep brown. Looks thick and rich.. Later this is confirmed.
The aroma is just wonderful. If there is such thing as a thick aroma, this is a beer that has it. Coffee, chocolate, vanilla, slight maple sweetness. 
Well, it drinks like a milkshake and is just glorious. Many of the same flavors mentioned above are here. Pretty complex actually. Coffee to chocolate to vanilla to maple. All are present. There is certainly plenty of sweetness, but it works with the big mouth feel and smoothness. 
I think the best part of this beer is the mouth feel. As mentioned above, it almost drinks like a milk shake. Silky smooth, creamy huge body, but not cloying at all.
Amazing drinkability, but you certainly can't session this big beer. Believe the hype on this beer and seek it out. It now sits among the top beers I've rated. Just love it. 1,728 charactersReagan1984, Jun 21, 2009
4.67/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Extremely dark brown body with no head and no retention to speak of.
Smell has notes of chocolate and coffee, and a great maple syrup aroma also.
Up front comes some big malt flavors in the form of bitter chocolate and coffee. Next I notice a great maple syrup flavor that pairs well with the slight, spicy oak and vanilla notes that come with it. I swear there is also a touch of bourbon in there. The finish is just a little bit hot from the alcohol. Overall, this flavor is both balanced and complex.
Mouthfeel is pretty good also. Not a lot of carbonation, which adds a nice thickness to the feel.
Extremely drinkable. This is a fantastic beer that exceeded my expectations 681 charactersHojaminbag, Jun 21, 2009

Looks a beautiful black liquid with a small but pillowy tan head.
Smell is that great founders stout scent with some barrel and a little maple. Not as strong as I had imagined, but still very very good.
Taste is similar to smell, reminds me of KBS with brown sugar. Coffee, roasted malt, barrel, brown sugar.
Mouthfeel is out of this world, thick and low carbonated but not flat, a real pillowy mouthfeel with some coaty goodness.
Worth the hype and drive. 549 characterssonicdescent, Jun 20, 2009

This beer is a delicous blend of roasted coffee, chocolate, and caramel. Some noticeable booze., and a bit of vanilla and maple. Very complex flavor profile. Lots of bitterness from the roasted malt and coffee. A little sweeter than I would prefer, but not too bad, just brings the drinkablility down. Not as much maple flavor as I thought there would be, but it doesnt matter, this is a great stout. 579 charactershckyfn9999, Jun 20, 2009

Served in a nice snifter tulip, pure back with the classic tan head. Sticky and oily sheets of lace really give this a good start.
But yeah, what can ya say about the aroma and taste? Just a delicate dance of maple, fig, vanilla, caramel, coffee - finishing with the bourbon kick to round it out. But, I will say, it's just touch on the sweet side to make it an absolute drinker. The high alcohol does have a smidgen of a medicine taste and flushing of the cheeks.
I'm glad to have had the opportunity to try such a limited brew. 719 charactersVancer, Jun 20, 2009

Served to me pitch black with a huge mocha head. Just an all-around appetizing way to start my drinking day (not to mention enjoying the fantastic company of eyebrews and his lovely lady)!
Lots and lots of maple in the nose. Chocolate maltiness as well. Hints of coffee.
I taste almost nothing but maple syrup up front. Then the rest of the smells come into play. There are notes of fruitiness but I can't get past that delicious maple... but that's why we're here isn't it?!
It's an extremely smooth beer and on a day where I had the BA Imperial, Sweet Darkness on nitro and BA Red's Rye... this one stole the show! 638 charactersrudylaw, Jun 16, 2009

Pours a dark and opaque brown/black, some dark reddish highlights in the edges, thin brown head forms, quickly settles to a thin collar, some lace spots stick. Smell is real nice, coffee and chocolate, maple/caramel sweetness, lightly woody, alcohol, dark fruit, very intense roast, touch of vanilla, very nice. Taste is similar, maple and caramel up front, nice rich sweetness, some brown sugar, buttery smooth middle, wood, molasses, chocolate, very intense roast and butterscotchy finish, touch of vanilla as well, real nice. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with low carbonation, some warmth going down, quite smooth. Had an "accidental" snifter of KBS before this because the server heard us wrong, oh no! CBS is smoother, not as roasty, but still pretty damn good. Nice stuff! 881 charactersViggo, Jun 15, 2009

Tastes of cocoa, coffee, alcohol at the back of the tongue, and hints of vanilla. Very similar to how it smells.
Mouthfeel is full bodied and creamy, very low carbonation, and a sticky finish.

12oz pour is an an inky black, little head. This brew is THICK. Seriously, you can see the viscosity on this one - it's syrup! Lacing down the glass.
Smell is toasted maple oats, maple syrup, roasted malts, light espresso.
Taste is SWEET. Wow, this is the ultimate dessert beer, thick and sweet - but it hurts the drinkability level. Sweet maple syrup, dark roasted malts, vanilla, brown sugar, hints of espresso. Alcohol in the finish, pretty hot - a little boozy. Would love to see how this one ages - would pretty much be perfect.
Overall, this is one ridiculously good beer and I'm glad I had the chance to try it. Not the most drinkable (especially on a warm Sunday evening) but so good. Please bottle this! 822 charactersritzkiss, Jun 08, 2009

Dark brown-to-black color with a thin mocha colored foam. The beer smelled like fresh Breakfast Stout, lots of coffee and malty sweetness with a hint of maple syrup (much less maple than I expected). The beer tastes the same as Breakfast Stout too, again with just a little maple. Delicious and addictive. Based on everything I've heard (and now tasted) I'd say this is almost identical to regular Breakfast Stout, a very close variant. 547 charactersTurdFurgison, Jun 07, 2009

Poured into a 5 oz tasting glass.
Color is a dark brown/nearly black. Tan head. Very little head of course, but great lace. Very nice. 
Aroma: Chocolate coffee, toffee, maple, a little alcohol, earthy hops. A little lighter aroma than Darkness, but still amazing because of the coffee notes here.
Taste: Chocolate, a lot of coffee, a little vanilla here, maple, some alcohol. A lot of roasted malts. Toffee. The taste is just like the smell.
Mouthfeel: Rich, creamy, and thick. Full bodied. Good carbonation. Ends with a chocolaty coffee aftertaste. Slightly dry.
Drinkability: only a 5 oz pour but I really tried to make it last long, but it didn't. Great easy drinking stout. I would want to drink a lot more of this if it wasn't so expensive. 815 charactersmothman, Jun 07, 2009

Ordered a CBS and KBS and drank them side by side. I can't think of a more perfect drinking experience.
A: Pitch black body with a centimeter of tan head.
S: Bourbon, molasses, subtle sweet maple syrup, and vanilla.
T: See smell. Incredible flavor. Very well balanced components. The maple syrup is subtle and well integrated with the beer. Not too sweet and not too dry.
M: Medium to thick body, creamy, with medium carbonation. 
D: Had a couple of these on top of a KBS and bourbon barrel aged imperial stout. Not feeling too great, but it was worth it.
Post-script: downright bizarre that anyone considers this inferior to Breakfast Stout, which is obviously inferior to KBS, much less CBS. 836 characterswaltonc, Jun 03, 2009

WOOHOO!
On-tap @ Founders.
12oz pour into Pils glass (?).
A - Black as black can be with a tan-colored head. Good lacing, very sticky head.
S - Sweet milk chocolate, maple syrup, expresso, no hint of the almost 10% of alcohol.
T - Huge sweet syrup flavors along with chocolate, expresso, and a nice creamy flavor as well. Slight alcohol burn and a bitterness on the end.
M - Full bodied, rich & thick, a little more carbonation then I really prefer with this style but still very smooth.
D - Way too easy to drink...another? Yes please!
A little better then the regular breakfast stout but not as good as KBS, IMO. 634 charactersSean9689, May 27, 2009

4.87/5  rDev +5.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Served on-tap at the Southphillytaproom in a wine glass. I jumped at the chance to get this offering from Founders.
A- The Canadian version is just as black and thick looking as the other version. Black as the night with a fairly sturdy dark tan head that loked yummy by itself. Some small spotty patches of lace on the way down.
S- This smells like pure bliss, and reminisant of an early Sunday breakfast with the family. Deep sweet roasted coffee backed with a good amount of roasted malt. Maple syrup is not spared and is right up there with the coffee, they make a good couple. Chocolate as well but not as prominent.
T- This is great, exactly what I needed. The maple syrup takes the lead and is sweet and yummy. The roasted coffee is not far behind and is almost making me cry at how well it melds with the coffee giving off a very sweet taste. Some vanilla from the barrels which I did not smell. Chocolate as well. I did not really pick up on any oatmeal from the base beer but that's probably cause I was focused on the main flavors.
M- Very sweet and a bit chewy. This one has a full body with ample carbonation. This one really blows your palette away probably because of it's super freshness. A sipper for sure, it would be wrong to gulp down this wonderful creation. Just like with regular breakfast and KBS a very nice feel on this.
D- I wish I was not driving as I would of had another and probably another. I sipped this gem throughout my meal and it worked both with the entree and as a desert beer. This is the real deal and fingers crossed that more gets made soon. Get on this if you have the chance. 1,625 charactersBARFLYB, May 24, 2009

4.94/5  rDev +6.7%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I made a special trip to Founders to have this beer before it ran dry.
A: Served in a pilsner glass, kinda weird but I'm rolling with it. Dark black color with maybe a half-finger of head. 
S: Man this is going to be good. A really nice blend of coffee, chocolate, dark dark malt and only a little bit of maple syrup. Maybe 15 minutes later as the serving was warmer, the maple syrup smell started to assert itself and that was a really nice addition.
T: This tasted extremely...refreshing? Can I say that about this beer? If you are saying no I can't, go to Founders soon and try some. Having had the Breakfast Stout and KBS, to me this was the most clean and crisp taste, I'm not sure if that is the maple syrup difference or what. Really nice balance, nothing is particularly overpowering. I thought to myself that this is the truest "breakfast" beer of the three from Founders, because it really tastes like a full breakfast in a glass.
M: Wonderful, see comments above. Thick of course, but this serving was well carbonated which I think actually improved the beer a lot.
D: Drinkability was the most striking improvement with this edition. I thought for 9.4%, this beer has some serious, world-class drinkability. If I didn't really want to tap into (I know) their other specialty offerings, I would have had more. 
This was a fantastic beer. One of the best in the class, if not the best, that I have had to date. Founders, please, for your own sake and mine, start making this beer on a regular basis! 1,515 charactersAVDeuph, May 23, 2009

Had a small glass at Stub & Herb's last night at the Founder's release party. Pitch black. Nose quiet but intriguing with the correctly advertised smells. 
Taste is subtle coffee with a lot of backing sweet malts, tangled up with the hint of maple that I might not have picked out if not for the blurb in front of me. A little vanilla, just a hint of bourbon, a few puppy dogs tails thrown in for good measure. Lots of stuff going on, but all fairly subtle, & the overall taste was good, not spectacular.
Hard to judge drinkability by the small serving, but I could have easily downed a pint of this, so that's good, right (I mean good score, not good that I didn't, since I had to back out of the parking lot where some ass had parked me in, but that's another story...). 
Overall a very good beer. Personally I'd take the regular Breakfast Stout or KBS over the CBS, but glad I had a chance to try it, & if it shows up in the Cities again, I'll go have another glass. 1,145 charactersmaximum12, May 22, 2009

Still, I got a small glass and it was a tasty treat. No, it'd didn't change my world or light up my tastebuds like my favorite beers, but I'd easily say it's near the top of the style. You've got a hint of maple syrup with bourbon and vanilla oak, all paired with rich, delicious coffee - and that's before you even get to the malts. The malt actually just provided a gentle, dry dark chocolate flavor behind all the bigger dessert flavors. A heck of beer and very drinkable for the style, but not a best-in-the-world beer in my opinion. Still, very, very good. I can't stress that enough. 765 characterstempest, May 21, 2009

Smell is a bit weaker than expected- a good amount of coffee and bitter chocolate.

A- Poured into snifter. Nice dark off black/deep brown color with some reddish undertones when held to the light. This came to me with a little I guess you could call head. No real lacing per say but it coats the glass and never really leaves.
S- Upon first smell I could make out a chocolate malty maple goodness. The maple and some oakish scent were faint and made a nice undertone to this beer. Almost a soy sauce smell like the KBS but not as strong. 
T- If this is what the hype with the beer has been then bring it on! Nice hot maple chocolate taste as the alcohol is doing it's thing. this seems to mellow out after some sipping is done. I like this. Nice tones of maple, slight presence of woody charater and a nice malty flavor comes through. This is amazing!
M- This is a chewy heavy beer that coats the palate through and through. After a drink it still stays around for a good while. Nice carbination for the style but I could have used maybe a little more. Heavy mouthfeel but not over the top.
D- This is a very drinkable beer. I wish I could have this aged but alas, it's not bottled. Oh well good job on raising the bar Founder's! 1,214 charactersalleykatking, May 20, 2009

A - Pours very dark with a bit of amber to it - the consistency is slightly less than motor oil - nice.
S - The nose has sweetness coming through up front as well as chocolate and a hint of maple.
T - Coffee is the most present in this brew - sweet flavor but in some ways it's lacking the maple syrup that I was searching for in this one. I even detect a bit of smoke in there. 
M - the carbonation is very light but it works for this beer.
D - I would rate the drinkability as high even considering the high ABV. Is it worth selling your house to sample this beer - no. However - I believe if you can get your hands on some it's quite enjoyable. 794 charactersbeerman207, May 19, 2009

Appearance: Extremely dark brown, nearly black, with gleaming red highlights, especially at the surface. Pours flat with no head and looks incredibly viscous and oily/sticky, leaving thick, leggy wash on the glass instead of lace. 
Smell: Chocolately, reminiscent of the original breakfast stout, slight maple syrup presence, reminds me of maple sausage, with a definite alcohol presence. 
Taste/Mouthfeel: Flavors of mild chocolate, sticky maple syrup that's earthy and a little smokey/oaky, darkly roasted malts, very sweet. Moderately hot alcohol upfront and again in my chest. Feel is very heavy, sticky and just carbonated enough to keep from falling flat. It is slick and oily as it slides over the palate. 
Drinkability: Moderate to good - almost too sweet for the style; keeps it from going down too fast. 943 characterskels, May 17, 2009

Appearance: Poured near black with just slight hints of red that are visible at the very surface when held to the light; very thick and viscous and there is a thick oily film that holds hard to the glass on the swirl; no carbonation present at all and there is no head whatsoever. Just looks murky.
Smell: Very deep dark roasty malts and a nice very dark and bittersweet chocolate presrence that is mixed with and masks an alcohol that seems that it is going to become much more present as it warms. 
Taste: Very strong presence of chocolate mixed with maple syrup; fair presence of alcohol is mixed in behind and at first I thought this was running a little hot but after a few more sips it really becomes quite smooth; has a slightly woody quality to it as well. Overall it's very very sweet.
Mouthfeel: Very smooth, rich and syrupy; a nice coating is left on the palate but it doesn't feel overly heavy or thick; a decent finish that catches me off guard because I thought I might be chewing on this one for a while; I do wish there was a bit more carbonation to it to give it some liveliness, but overall it was kind of like sipping on corn syrup. 
Drinkability: Moderate. The flavors are nice and pretty much what I would have expected from this offering, but the sweetness gets to be a bit much and the mouthfeel gets a bit disconcerting because it doesn't feel like a "beer." 1,499 charactersbamadog, May 16, 2009

I was thrilled to see this rare gem on the ridiculous guest taps. This was probably my second favorite beer behind '09 VBDL. Deep, rich black center with a very dark brown edge. The aroma suffered being served in plastic, but not at all with the flavor. This had even more of a "breakfast" feel to it with maple syrup note that came across much drier than expected. The roasted malts brought an excellent smoky, charred note that brought to mind its stablemate Kentucky Breakfast Stout. Wow, it just seems like Founders can do no wrong with the style. CBS, KBS, Breakfast, and their Imperial are all beers worthy of the hype and I find myself compelled to buy them every chance I get. 703 charactersSteamhead, May 14, 2009

I had it at the founders black party about a month ago but wanted to have it a second time to make sure that it was as delicious as I thought it was at first, and yes it was.
A - Black, brown at the edges, with a creamy thin head.
S - Smelled like coffee, bourbon, malt. Exactly what you would expect from a founders breakfast stout.
T - It hits with the bourbon, as it developed in my mouth there was a strong coffee and malt flavor, and as it finished it had a strong maple finish.
M/D - Sharp, Crisp, Warm. I couldn't pound these but I wouldn't want to, it's a drinking beer, take it slow and it will reward you.
Fantastic, get out to founders and try it. 690 charactersDonerik, May 13, 2009

This beer is fantastic. The apperance is similar to KBS, pitch black with a nice tan head. The aroma is distinct and divine. You can tell there is some maple in the nose. The taste is wonderful, it doesn't hit you in the face with Bourbon like KBS. It's more complex, definite sweetness from the maple syrup barrels. Epic. For a stout, it doesn't get much better or complex than this. The alcohol is non existent. The drinkability is incredible for as much as there is going on in this thing. Wow, what a beer. If you can get this, don't hesitate. 610 charactersBrew33, May 11, 2009
4.55/5  rDev -1.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Get to review this as I drink it thanks to the wireless at Founders.
Dark black pour with many brown hints swirling around. Strong cream colored head that reduces to a thin layer like oil on top of water. Really sticks to the glass. When I tilt it to the side to bring some of the bubbles onto the glass and tip it the other way, they remain stuck to the glass under the level of the beer for an interesting effect.
Aroma has espresso, mocha and a hint of oak and waffles(with maple syrup of coarse).
Taste is also an interesting blend of the aromas. More bourbon barrel type flavors with the maple throughout the middle, than in the aroma. Almost creamy mouthfeel, similar to it's breatheren. The kind of caramel latte finish lingers for just a bit, but not real long. Alcohol is non-existant as well. Like that there is just slightly less abv in this one compared to their other imperials.
Overall it's safe to say this is another chart topper from Founders. Would go really well with a slab of bacon. I think I prefer the regular KBS just a bit more, will be comparing to the Barrel aged Imperial shortly.
Only drawback thus far is the intense grain scents from the brewing operation throwing off the aroma from time to time. 1,228 charactersBung, May 05, 2009

Served in a plastic cup
The beer poured a deep brown/black with a creamy, mocha-colored head that faded to a lasting frothy cap. Thin rings of lacing trickled down the cup.
The aroma was outstanding. Coffee was most noticeable. Freshly brewed, dark roast coffee to be precise. Semi-sweet and smooth with notes of vanilla and oats.
The taste was very similar to the aroma. Again, coffee dominated. Coffee grounds specifically came to mind. Deep, dark and rich. Bourbony with notes of brown sugar. The finish was woody and oaky. A touch of maple syrup appeared as well. Overall, the flavor profile was similar to KBS, except a bit sweeter.
The mouthfeel was medium/full bodied. Smooth and supple. Creamy, frothy and pillowy.
Drinkability was quite good. This was a tasty, rich and complex brew. The 9.4% ABV was very well masked by the intense flavor profile.
I was really impressed with this beer. Even though the addition of maple syrup did little flavor-wise, it really helped to mellow out the roasty bitterness in this brew. Definitely seek this one out, if you can find it! 1,118 charactersDamian, May 04, 2009

Had on-tap @ Founder's on 4-22-2009
Pours dark black, like KBS. One-finger head of creamy mocha colored foam which leaves a nice ring around the glass sides. Lacing is spotty, but pretty slick.
The maple syrup definitely finds your sense of smell first. Surprisingly, it is hand-in-hand with the coffee and chocolate notes from KBS. This one smells so deliciously inviting. It's like chocolate chip pancakes with coffee, in a glass. Mmmmm, breakfast time!
It almost tastes like KBS to begin with. Lots of deep, dark chocolate notes mixing with dark roasted coffee notes. Then you get a touch of maple sweetness, on the finish. The good part is that as you continue taking sips, the maple builds up and becomes more prominent. It only gets to a point of equality with the other flavors though. It never overpowers them.
This is super tasty and nicely balanced.
Good, full body. Nice and thick. Slightly oily. Smooth and velvet like.
Good, smooth and easy to drink. Here's another brew that I wish Founder's would start bottling. I'm fairly certain that I prefer it to KBS.
I want more, please! 1,136 characterscoldmeat23, May 01, 2009
5/5  rDev +8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5(reviewed from notes taken at extreme beer fest 09)
This is, without a doubt.. the greatest beer I have ever had in my entire life..
If you are familiar with KBS, imagine taking that, easing the bourbon and general brown liquor character, then inject it with pure maple syrup and you can just start to understand how incredible this beer is.. Again, similar mouthfeel and such to KBS, similar consistency and viscosity. Also a similarly strong aroma, but, again, with much sweeter of an essence. Sweet like pancakes, not like candy. 
If there is ever one truly great thing which we, here on BA.com and as advocates of great beer in general, may hope to do for the universe of beer... it would be getting this beer released for real, if only in short supply. It was truly, the greatest beer I could even imagine. 812 charactersBirdFlu, May 01, 2009
4.27/5  rDev -7.8%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Another offering from the insane guest tap list from DL day.
Pours very dark brown in color. There's just a ring of froth around the perimeter of the glass. Smell is black roasted coffee, some cocoa and a very nice, rich maple smell. The maple flavors really shine in the flavor. It takes the edge off the harshness of the black coffee and really sweetens it up and smooths it out. I actually am thinking that I prefer this to the regular breakfast stout. Still huge and somewhat cloying in the mouthfeel. Very good beer. Very happy I got to try so many one off crazy beers this year. I consider myself lucky. 609 charactersFtownThrowDown, Apr 29, 2009
4.54/5  rDev -1.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Closed out the day with 2 pours of this at DLD '09. 
Looked much like KBS in the glass, a thin cap of dark brown creamy mocha foam that gently stuck to the sides. Black oily liquid. Fantastic maple aroma that took the edge off the raw coffee roast, and sweetened it up ever so slightly. Smooth and supple feel, low carbonation, almost slippery. Rich chocolate & bitter coffee elements from the stout, soft maple traces, and buttery vanilla from the barrel. ABV was well hidden, and I had no problem finishing the 10+/- ounces that were combined in one cup. The maple syrup/bourbon barrel really added a nice extra dimension to it, without too much additional sweetness. This was the only guest tap I sampled at DLD, and I felt lucky to try it, though that doesn't factor into the score. 787 charactersemerge077, Apr 28, 2009
4.8/5  rDev +3.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5On tap @ Founders Brewing Company on 4/23/09. 8 oz pour served in a snifter. 
Pours black as an oil slick with a 1/2 finger of frothy burnt mocha colored head that spreads out across the surface. This just flares up beautifully when swirled, leaving a rich cascade of foam and brown oily residues back. Awesome! The delicious smelling stickiness of the maple syrup is the first thing that sticks in the nose but I'm also quite surprised by how much of the fresh smelling coffee and chocolate character of the regular Breakfast Stout is coming through as well. The mix of these two elements just smells fantastic! Digging at bit deeper in the nose, I'm also picking up some light barrel notes of wood and vanilla underneath, that give the nose even a touch more depth. 
The taste quite frankly, is delicious. Crunchy roasted coffee character and a deep undercurrent of chewy chocolate malts, wrapped up in that same slickly sweet (and a touch boozy) taste of maple syrup notes. Really nice balance here with the flavors just intermingling effortlessly. Finishes very sweet with notes of syrup and chocolate just COATING the palate at times. The mouthfeel is full bodied with a huge mouth filling nature that is both creamy and slick at the same time and a feel that just slathers the mouth with flavors. Overall this just flows so easily in the mouth, with the ABV being dangerously hidden. Fantastic. 
Wow. Now this is a Breakfast Stout! Not only do you get coffee but now you also get maple syrup covered chocolate chip pancakes! Seriously, this stuff was just damn tasty, easy as hell to drink for the size, and honestly, I think that I prefer this to the KBS. More please! 1,678 charactersKegatron, Apr 28, 2009

A- Pours a dark black color with pretty much no head but a ring of brownish colored bubbles around the ring.
S- I thought this one smelled pretty much just like KBS with maybe a hint of sweetness from the maple syrup and a bit more vanilla.
T- Again I thought it reminded me a lot of KBS probably since I just drank one a couple days before the big event. I did think this one was a little sweeter than the KBS. Man, I'd love to do a side by side of this one. A bit sweeter in taste and a lot less of the bourbon flavor in this one. 
M- Medium in body and low carbonation. 
D- A totally awesome brew just add this one to the list of awesome Founders brews. I hope this one keeps coming year after year and hopefully bottled sometime down the road. 811 charactersnrbw23, Apr 28, 2009
4.82/5  rDev +4.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Another DLD '09 sample review.
Not much head, but a stubborn collar that never quite went away. The aroma was intense chocolate and roasty malt with a candyish maple, but genuine, no Golden Griddle in sight.
The taste I think I actually prefer to KBS as I like maple more than whiskey &lt;gasp&gt;..it's true!
Plenty of rich roasted malts, coffee and chocolate. Despite a day of measured tasting, the intensity of this beer was impressive. The sample size was small but the aftertaste hung around for the patient, allowing me to pick out and concentrate on any particular flavor I wanted as it ever so slowly faded.
The mouthfeel is velvety, thick and viscous. 
I shared my glass with a number of attendees, why the *hell* were they not in there getting some of their own?!?! But proof positive that Founders needs to find a way to get this brew bottled and distributed. 875 charactersbrewdlyhooked13, Apr 28, 2009

A- Pours a dark, chocolate brown with a vibrant off-white head.
S- The smell was mesmerizing. A nice chocolate roastiness that was tapered with a maple sweetness. The most impressive part was that neither was over done. Just the right amount. 
T- Possibly even better than the aroma. The balance was there, yet unique enough to entertain from beginning to end. Initially taste is that of roasted and chocolate malts with a little bit of maple. As the taste progresses, the sweetness of the maple transforms almost to a fruit like finish. What I really liked is the maple wasn't overdone and really complimented the flavors.
M- Nice, thick body that almost makes it feel like a dessert.
D- One of the most drinkable RIS I have had in a while. 
Overall, this is definitely my favorite from Founders. I would gladly take this over the KBS and Breakfast Stout. 929 charactersrhinos00, Apr 27, 2009

A: Thick, Dark with little or no head.
S: Maple, vanilla and plenty of coffee with some dark chocolate notes. I'm dying to taste this at this point.
M: Smooth and creamy. No bite at all. The alcohol is slightly present at this thing warms, but overall its syrupy and utterly decadent.
T: Maple, coffee, chocolate, vanilla all perfectly balanced and a few more complex, subtle flavors as this one warms. The coffee is more up front on this one than the KBS and of course, the maple syrup makes me hungry for pancakes.
I want more of this! I love the KBS but this brew is absolutely killer. The KBS needs some age to soften up the bourbon heat, but the CBS is nearly perfect right out of the gate. I'll definetely seek this one out again. 812 charactersjdflyer06, Apr 27, 2009

This brew is quite simply, nirvana. It's a balance between sweet maple syrup and ale, yet not cloying. A choclately brown color served in a 12 oz pilsner glass at the brewery. A thin tan head graces the surface and lace clings to the glass. It's chocolatey and full mouthfeel blesses the imbiber with each pull. First gracing my tongue at EBF, it again offered an aggressive coffee, maple and chocolate nose. This is meant to be enjoyed in the dead of winter next to a roaring fire. This is as near perfection as you can get. A one off from what the bartenderes tell me due to the difficulty of getting wine barrels in which maple syrup was stored from one supplier. One of the finest brews I've ever had. Only wish they could make this part of their seasonal line-up.

S: Sweet maple syrup takes over the senses. I smell nothing else, but brown sugar and maple syrup. I think this beer is going to be extraordinarily sweet! 
M/T: Lighter bodied then I expected. Medium carbonation bite and a semi sweet taste on the tongue. This beer does not taste ½ as sweet as I thought it would be. The backlash is kind of bitter actually which was surprising. The aftertaste is way intense, maple syrup, sweet malt and the bitterness gets a little overwhelming.

A - By the time I got my glass from the server there was no foam left, so I spied on a glass being poured and noted a half-finger of mocha foam that dissipated quickly with negligible lace. Pitch black.
S - Coffee with cream, maple syrup, a hint of whiskey, roasted malts. It's a lot like regular Breakfast Stout (which is the base beer), but with the obvious maple/whiskey influence.
T - There's a lot more whiskey in the flavor, with a healthy amount of maple syrup, bitter coffee, and roasted malts. Again, it's a slightly richer version of regular Breakfast stout, and the added flavors complement the beer very well.
M - Moderate carbonation the complements the whiskey bite. Medium bodied, very smooth and creamy. It's what I expect from an American Double Stout.
D - The ABV is high, and the flavor is very intense, particularly the coffee bitterness and the whiskey bite. As a result palate fatigue sets in earlier than usual. Other than that, eminently quaffable!
A great variation on an already great beer. Hope this makes it out of the brewpub at some point. 1,140 charactersMasterSki, Mar 14, 2009

Very dark liquid with minimal head but looked great regardless. 
Lots of coffee, and chocolate with noticeable Maple.
As is the original breakfast stout, this beer has lots of coffee character. This has much less bitterness than the original however since the maple balances out the beer and adds additional sweetness.
The mouthfeel is rich and thick, with a dry finish which I attribute to the extreme amounts of coffee in this beer.
This is a fantastic beer, I think it may be slightly better than the original since the maple balances out the acrid character of original breakfast stout. 629 charactersalovesupreme, Mar 05, 2009
