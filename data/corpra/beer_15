4.81/5  rDev +3.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Pours a super hazy orange with a nice, fluffy, yet dense foam.
The smell is incredibly juicy and tropical. Citrus and tons of pineapple. Absolutely lovely...
The taste is intensely juicy, with orange and pineapple marrying a perfect hop bite. Ends on a hint of honey dew. So damn balanced.
Mouthfeel is soft and pillowy, medium bodied.
Julius is one of the daddies of the NE IPA craze, and it's easy to see why. I slightly prefer Alter Ego, but damn is this good. 467 charactersJamFuel, Jun 23, 2017

s: raw oranges, onion, mango, apricot, peach juice, grapefruit, pineapple, and a little bit of danky earthy herbal hops.  the smell is a combination of the tropical fruity hops and that oniony aroma as well
t: the initial taste is like straight biting into an orange.  sweet orange juice followed by the bitter orange rind.  behind that is grapefruit, tangerine, and peach juice.  there is a juicy pineapple, slightly under-ripe mango, and apricot.  in the back there is a doughy presence that acts as a subtle backbone.  the finish is that sweet orange juice. 
m: the mouthfeel is a medium.  the carbonation is forceful and deliberate.  it acts to push the fruity flavors onto the tongue.  there is also that sort of fullness in the mouth that you get from many of these NE IPAs
o:  its a raw, fruity tasting IPA.  it would be easy for me to say this is the standard for these NE IPA beers.  its juicy and not overly bitter.  at 6.8%, this is dangerously drinkable. 1,043 charactershopsputin, Jun 08, 2017

4.58/5  rDev -1.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75This was poured into a becher pint glass. The appearance was a hazy burnt orange color with a lasting one finger white foamy head. Slow dissipation. Thin white speckled lacing. The aroma proceeds to sweet portions of citrus and tropical fruits while allowing a nice subtle crisp resin fresh backbone (in the malt?), seems like to me that the resin in the malt part?, hmmm, interesting. The flavor brings together the hops and the malts to blend fantastically allowing a burst of juicyiness in the full flavor and sliding into the aftertaste and finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a spectacular sessionability about it. Carbonation seems spot on for the style to allow the bitterness bite down on a great amount of harshness hitting my tongue. Overall, wow, holy crap and a half, New England juicy bitterness bomb, awesome. Definitely would have again. 893 charactersLone_Freighter, Jun 05, 2017

However, after having fresh haze, green and doppelganger, I think there are better, hoppier, more flavorful options at TH - within the regular release lineup. This beer is definitely a juice bomb NEIPA and I would drink it over 95% of beers out there, but it lacks the wow factor that fresh haze and green have when you taste them. 437 characterspeaceloveandhops, Jun 03, 2017

IT has some great citrus and tropical fruit flavors, but I can't really get past the mouthfeel with this beer.

Aroma is nice, however, and goes well with the style. Tropical with hints of citrus. Notes of "green" stems.  Taste is good, too although the fruits not as salient as in the nose.  The feel isn't quite right. A bit light, not much bitterness yet some tannin, probably not from hops. Overall a good beer. Would not trade for it again, nor seek it out. Just not my thing. 557 charactersMebuzzard, May 23, 2017

My favorite aspects: the appearance, a near opaque dark orange that almost seems to glow dimly; and the smell - orange, tangerine, orange flavored Fun Dip, and fresh hop. The taste is also incredible, and it leaves a subtle slightly spicy coating on your tongue. 
This beer is well worth its rating here, it exceeded my expectations. I can't find any negatives worth mentioning - it could get a little sweet after a couple, but even that wouldn't keep me from drinking it all night long. I look forward to trying some of Julius's stronger variants. 671 characterseastcoastdan, May 20, 2017

this is my first time drinking TH - Ive had lots of hyped beers in the past but for some reason the ridiculous expectation on this one far surpasses any other. 
can dated 5/11/17 pours out a hazed light golden orange with a creamy bright white head that leaves nice lacing. excellent looking brew! 
big aromas bring candied tangerine orange, soft fuzzy peach, ripe mango, earthy dankness, floral and spicy notes, has some doughy malts as well as a gummy and honey like sweetness, smells delicious! On palate is absolutely massive orange flesh, oily grapefruit peel, some pithy lemon/lime notes, creamy nectarines, mango, and that like spicy hop saturation thing, insanely delicious and seriously difficult not to chug. also has doughy malts, passionfruit, herbaceous minty note, an almost sugary sweetness, but its a good thing!! only a touch of pine coming through on the finish, very minimal bitterness. mouthfeel is light but ohhh so creamy, pure fluff. 
overall this lived up to the hype - I can understand why folks are standing in line to attain relatively small amounts of this. absolutely delicious! 1,219 charactersHyptochrons, May 15, 2017

4.9/5  rDev +5.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured from a 16 oz can into a tulip glass (1 month old). Appearance is opaque and yellow/orange/mango in color with two finger thick white head (fairly good retention). Smell is beautiful orange pulp/juice with a nice presence of slightly bitter orange pith. There is a hint of earthy hops/spruce and resin as well. 
Taste follows the nose with orange hop flavors most prevalent. There is a little more resiny sweetness than in the aroma, but it is still on the drier side. There is some noticeable bitterness, but it is so well done balancing out the other flavors. Mouthfeel is an almost perfect medium to full body, smooth and creamy up front, with a nice crisp bite on the finish. However, it is still juicy all the way through. There is a small tingling sensation from the carbonation that makes this IPA extremely drinkable without taking away from the body.
Overall, this is another world class IPA from Treehouse. It has the classic juice, haze and mouthfeel that embodies their house yeast. This is a nice complement to Haze that may not be as complex, but presents great bitter orange juice/pulp flavors. There is some resin sweetness that balances everything out making this an overall excellent beer. 1,215 charactersthatche2, May 03, 2017

T - Juice for sure, tons of pineapple, mango, some grapefruit, white grape, pine and very light malt base.
M - Light in body and feel, not a lot of lingering bitterness.
O - This is the definintion of a New England style IPA, granted I will say its not a mind-blowing experience, as Ive had a number of these beers, but this is solid and drinkable for sure. Tree house is an awesome brewerey, this is an exceptional beer. 614 charactersOmnium, Apr 22, 2017

4.3/5  rDev -7.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25A very solid beer from treehouse but in my opinion not quite worth all the hype.  Smells great of juicy nectar and looks beautiful hazy orange but the feel leaves some to be desired. Or rather the flavor. The great smell doesn't really translate into the flavor as much as I would have expected, I thought it would smack me in the face with flavor but it was rather subdued. The beer would also be way better if it had more carbonation.
All this said it is another great unique treehouse beer well worth trying. I personally prefer their IIPAs such as haze and doppelganger, but this is still a winner. 603 charactersVeejuh, Apr 14, 2017

Pours a glowing hazy orange color with one of the nicest heads for an IPA. The head is fluffy and laces itself beautifully around the glass. Some of the nicest lacing I've seen from an IPA. Perfect 5/5 for me there.
Smell is very nice. A grassy dank pine aroma with some sharp citrus mixed in there along with a hint of mango.
Damn this thing is the business! Big time tropical fruits up front especially passionfruit / tangerine and quite a bit of mango. A really nice piney and dank taste it. It is one of the most balanced hoppy beers I've had. They balanced the hop / pine bitterness with the mango perfectly. 
Feel is ridiculous. I could drink this thing all day it goes down so smooth. Not much carbonation to speak of but it doesn't drink thin at all. 
Overall this is an amazing brew worthy of the hype. It is so balanced and clean in taste that it is truly mind blowing. It reminds me of a hazy and more fruity Pliny. 1,054 charactersaoampm, Apr 12, 2017
4.47/5  rDev -3.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25From a trade, canned 3/29
Pours a hazed rich gold color with a small frothy head. Nose is honestly like candy... TONS of candied mango, pineapple, key lime pie and some honey. VERY bright smelling. Taste is very malt forward! Malt bill is strong with caramel and even dominates the flavor profile over hops. Hops provide little bite but bursts of tropical fruit and melon. Overall, I was so surprised how malt-forward these Tree House beers are and kind of love that. Solid beer overall, but not my favorite NE IPA out there 525 charactersscottyshades, Apr 12, 2017

a great beer.  maybe i need to try a fresher one to appropriately rate it.  i really enjoyed it but think there are so many beers of this style now that it tasted rather familiar to me.  i guess that's the problem with rating/reviewing high rated beers and is it fair to judge if they live up to the expectation.  this one was great but it didn't for me, i was far more blown away by Other Halfs DDH Mylar Bags from a few weeks ago - which tastes very very similar to me. Or LIC Beer Project Higher Burnin - that beer tastes even more "juicy" if i'm forced to use that word...still very glad i tried it, want to try a fresher one, and wish it was easier to come by! 732 charactersc_tails, Apr 11, 2017

4.85/5  rDev +4.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Snagged Julius and Green at the brewery yesterday.  Cracked Julius the same day it was brewed, after 2-3 hours in the fridge to chill.  Pouring it into a pint glass I immediately catch the rich aroma of hops and citrus, which is remarkably potent.  Once in the glass the beer is completely opaque.
The taste of the beer very closely follows the smell.  It is rich, incredibly flavorful, complex and yet smooth as can be.  There is hardly any bitterness at all, and after each sip you are left with only the taste of fruity hops.  If I have one criticism, it is that Julius lacks the hop intensity of other highly-rated NE IPAs, such as Green or Sip of Sunshine.  I enjoy the mouth-filling hop rush of those beers, and you don't quite get that with Julius.
Still, this is one of the best beers I have ever had, and as many readers have said before me, you should drink it any chance you get. 892 charactersDaggs911, Mar 30, 2017

It's a beautiful hazy orange pour with a bright citrus nose. Now I have the taste a 4 which is well below the norm for this year perhaps but I did so because of the huge flour presence in this particular can. The juice was there but it was just muddled a bit by a flour like for taste. It's a good beer and no doubt my particular was not the standard bearer for what Julius should be looking forward to trying again soon. 491 charactersMFMB, Mar 26, 2017

The look is bizarre (like . smoothy) and super cool. The taste is so good. Like they used all of the fruits in a fresh fruit bowl to ferment it and then added millions of orange peels at the very end. I don't get the feel part b/c it's beer. It better feel good in the mouth if it tastes good, right? One of my top 10 beers of all time. I wonder if it tastes this great in the can. Mine was out of a growler. 512 charactershapiday, Mar 10, 2017

This beer smells like an orange grove that has been invaded by mangoes, passion fruit and grapefruit. I find that the smell is much more intense out of the can than when poured into a glass.  I am already trying to find a way to turn this into a cologne.  Looks like a muddled orange, rind and all...hazy to the point I can't see the emblem on the other side of the glass, a signature of Tree House brews, I am learning.  A good inch and a half of head that slowly melted away leaving plenty of lacing along the way that just sticks to the side of the glass. Has a slightly sour orange/grapefruit introduction that gradually fades into a more sweet and soft finish, very creamy. Super soft feel, like stuffing a handful of fresh powdery snow in your mouth.  If you have to drive over two hours to get your hands on this like I did I have to imagine you are going to be just as satisfied and glad you did as I am.  So glad I have 6 more of these patiently waiting for me in my fridge. 1,015 charactersGreyvtrayn, Mar 09, 2017

The hype is very real, Julius delivers on every aspect, this beer alone could sustain a profitable brewery for a very long time.  Julius pours a very beautiful, hazy yellow/orange with about a one inch head.  It's about the same color as the can it comes in.  Smell is in your face tropical fruits, mango, orange, tangerine, pineapple, a touch of melon.  Taste follows the smell, big orange, mango, tangerine flavor, hints of melon, very slight rounded bitterness.  An absolute juice bomb.  Mouthfeel is full, creamy, very stout-like.  Overall it is a very easy drinking, delicious, dare I say sessionable at 6.5% abv... 683 charactersNugget40, Mar 07, 2017

Aroma has massive amounts of Tangerine and mango. A little peach and earth, a hint of yeast and biscuity malt.
Taste has a prominent earthy apricot background over which the brighter hop flavors of orange and mango play. A little sweet tart up front and a present but heavily subdued bitterness on the finish.
Medium to light body though very smooth, crisp carbonation.
Overall the aroma is the greatest part of this beer, which is tough when the flavor just can't quite hit all those notes. It is a very good NEIPA but I believe there are better ones from Tree House. 685 charactersHoppy_Time, Feb 25, 2017

S: orange farm grass citrus rind tangerine fresh ripe mango and grapefruit in force
T: fruit overload.  I haven't had this in over a year and this second try is just as surprising as the first.   The mango is in abundance, the tangerine flavors are extremely pronounced.  For many people, this beer is too much.  The sweetness of the beer is overbalanced with whirlpool hops that are not bitter but full of flavor.  I am convinced that this beer for the inexperienced might be confused for a cocktail with orange and peach juice.   Fuzzy navel anyone?
M: thick with light to moderate carbonation

Consumed 2/22/17
Poured into a Tulip
Palate Contaminants: None.
Appearance: Pours a hazy golden orange almost amber with a pinky finger's layer of head. Great head retention. 
Smell: Oh. My. God. As soon as you crack the can you get hit with a citrus and mango punch, so sweet you may want a Julius in-scent for your home. A real treat for your nostrils!
Taste: You guessed it! Probably the classic North East tropical hop-bomb! Absolutely outstanding, mango, citrus, peach, all up front with the perfect amount of bitter and the finish is so smooth it's almost creamy.
Mouth Feel: Somewhere in the middle of medium and heavy mouth feel that's almost entirely concentrated on the tongue. Heavier than mouth feel than a Focal banger but much lighter than a Crusher, for example. 
Overall: If there is such a thing as a perfect beer this would certainly be in the ball park. Everything you want in an East Coast IPA. Unfiltered, Unpasteurized, Sweet, Tangy, Bitter, Smooth. How is it possible? Find it. Drink it. 1,029 charactersPeabzZ, Feb 22, 2017

Appear: was a nice fingers worth of pretty off white head that lingered and faded in about 2 mins.  left nice lacing on the glass. color is class NE Haze orange goodness 
Nose:  Big OJ notes smelled as soon as I cracked the can.  there's also some nice stone fruits peaches mango. slight herbal note but it's really all about the fruit juice in this one.  
Taste: Follows the nose for sure.  nice citrus notes grapefruit orange and the pith of both as well nice smooth tasty finish. slight bitter note but if you don't think about it you wouldn't even notice it.  
Mouth:  Awesome.  medium juicy creaminess 
Over:  Does it get any better. I still think Haze and maybe Alter Ego are better (that I've had) but this is right there with those two from TH.  I also am giving this beer a little extra here because it's holding up.  We're closing in on 60 days and this beer still taste amazingly fresh.  I've had other NE's from other breweries that after 30 days it's hit or miss. 1,037 charactersGumbo_gravy, Jan 19, 2017

4.33/5  rDev -6.7%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 416oz can, poured into a Tree House Snifter Glass. Enjoyed on 12.19.16, reviewed from Tasting Journal.
The beer pours a crazy turbid and hazy orange color, looks just like a glass of OJ when poured, super haze, thick and foamy white head, two fingers tall that has great retention and lace. The aroma is really juicy, tons of citrus, lots of orange juice, tangerine juice, light grapefruit, some floral and grassy hop character with a bit of tropical mango and very sweet yeast and doughy malt. The flavors follow the nose really well, insanely juicy hops, really citrusy, orange and grapefruit with loads of tropical fruits, light resin and pine flavor, grassy floral and green hops with plenty of sweet, doughy malt, and the soft sweetness from the NEIPA yeast. The mouthfeel is very good, coating, creamy, super smooth, gentle medium body that has a lightly dry finish.
Verdict: A standout IPA from Tree House. Juicy, bursting with bright, intense hoppy flavor that is super drinkable, very refreshing and delicious. Definitely a worthwhile brew. 1,050 characterskevanb, Jan 14, 2017

It has a hazy orange color that reflects the inclusion of intense citrus hops.  I've never had any other IPA like this one.  Over the past year, I've had it many times, and my opinion has not changed.  My high rating reflects my willingness to wait in line for an hour at the brewery on their canning days. 419 charactersmillerdb48, Jan 13, 2017

Smell is guava, apricot, passion fruit, mango, papaya, and tangerine with dimensional and exceptional. 
Taste follows tropical from to start to finish and that isn't a complaint. 
Mouthfeel is a solid medium, enough carbonation, not dry, but juicy as hell, and drinkability is off the charts. 
Overall my expectations with one where exceptionally high and it lived up to it. Outstanding beer. 563 charactersSawDog505, Jan 04, 2017

Pours into a light golden cloud with a thickness that holds down its froth. Aroma is instantly inviting with tropical fruitiness. It's smooth drinking with pulpy mango juice mouthfeel, but with enough hop foundation to give it a little bite on the tongue.  A lively finish that leaves you trying to capture each flavorful note.  Makes me want to slow down, think, and appreciate how lucky I am to experience it. The lower ABV makes it hard to say "no" to seconds. A beautifully crafted beer. 610 charactersSicilianDefenseR, Jan 01, 2017

S: The same delicious fruit notes I get from most of Tree House's beers.  Melon, mango, and orange.  
T: This is where it hits the mark.  Perfectly sweet with a faint, lingering bitterness.  It even tastes of the fruits described above. Not sure how to describe the bitterness other than very light, but leaves you wanting to take another sip.
F: Medium to medium-light body. Delicate and soft.  Almost no astringency.  Dryness dissipates quickly.

The beer pours like homogenized pulpy organize juice, and as the precious liquid is hitting the glass wild aromas are emerging and you can smell it from a couple feet away. (Like really how does Tree House do this? As a home brewer I am stunned every time)
The beer is a robust orange color and the nose is juicy orange (no lemon or grapefruit at all) with a pleasant rotting hop quality to it. Now when I smell it I am 99 percent sure they are using Simcoe in there somewhere, which means I need to use Simcoe in my hazy IPA recipe.
The taste is lucious, mouth watering, and there is just hoppy orange juice with virtually no hop bitterness at the end, just more succulentness (is that a word? Now it is!)
Julius, you do me right. 793 charactersaac5269, Dec 19, 2016

M- Smooth, creamy, medium body.
O- A great IPA and much more of a stand out than Sap.  Nose is amazing, but the taste falls short of the quality of the nose, still great though.  Very easy to drink, alcohol really is not noticeable.  If you can get some it will be worth your time. 542 characterslarryi86, Dec 19, 2016

Palate Contaminants: none
The appearance is a very opaque, thick medium orange. Moderate amount of fine head.
The smell is slightly bitter orange juice. It also has lactose, watermelon, pine nut. It's that kind of savory sweet that's so pleasant. 
The first taste I get is watermelon bubblegum. A little warmth brings up honeydew melons. Bits of grapefruit and banana are buried in the background, but add a welcome bit of color. There are also strong elements of herbs, like tarragon. Some fresh vegetation is certainly there. It's not super complex, but what's there is very good and very well executed.
The feel is moderate thickness with very fine carbonation. The melons and tarragon hang around. I'd hardly guess that it contained any alcohol unless the growler tag said so. 814 charactersZythophile, Dec 17, 2016

Everything about the beer look, smell, feel are great. Is it bad to say that a 100% rated beer didn't live up to my expectations? Have had beers in CT. that I thought the taste of the beer was better (dose,coriolis). Maybe my palate is not sophisticated enough I get that with wine. Curious about different batches if there is a taste differential. Great beer just maybe too much hype? 497 charactersRugg315, Dec 16, 2016

S: straight tropical citrus.  Heavy orange, clementine, pineapple.  
T: like a fresh juicy bite into the best tasting fruit you've had.  Clean flavor profile with minimal bitterness.  Lots of bright flavor without crowding the palate. Not much malt to speak of. Finishes much like the fruit, mild rind flavor without the heavy bitterness.
M: just right.  heavy enough to carry the hops without a malt profile yet light enough to remain refreshing and highly drinkable
O: Excellent IPA, fresh, tropical citrus flavors with smooth, effervescent body.  There is a reason this beer is the flagship of one of the best breweries in the world and is the figurehead for a revolutionary style of hazy IPAs. 735 charactersDoctorMyEye, Dec 11, 2016

I don't rate here much anymore but have been having a lot of NE style IPAs lately (lawson, trill, veil, tired hands etc.) and this is one where I'd give a perfect score on the BA scale.  Flat out worth the hype and acclaim.
11/16 can, complete haze. Looks like orange juice.  Gorgeous head, retention, lacing.

4.38/5  rDev -5.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.25Description: A hazy, cloudy appearance with a color that is sort of like apple cider but maybe a little lighter.  White lacing but not much head.  Aroma is full of tropical and citrus flavors (grapefruit, orange, peach) along with floral notes and some pine.  Smell is deep and complex with several different layers.  The taste is more bitter up front than the smell would indicate and that bitterness carries through to the finish.  As it warms more of the fruity, floral notes make an appearance.  Candidly, I wish the taste had been more consistent with the aroma.  Mouthfeel is rich, velvety and much thicker than a normal IPA.
Suggested food pairing: Ahi tuna
If you like this beer then you should also try: Stone Enjoy By Unfiltered IPA
Overall: 4.25 (This beer is good and I would likely have it again)  This beer didn't really disappoint - it's a good beer - but I don't know that it lives up to the hype.  The aroma was really great and maybe raised my expectations for the taste which I thought was a little bit lacking.  All in all, not the best IPA I've ever had but certainly worth trying if you have the chance. 1,128 charactersSHDoyle, Dec 08, 2016

Looks:  Pours a turbid turbidity that is more turbid that I've ever seen before.  An orange color somewhere between that of orange juice and our president-elect.  The head stands up a full inch and never backs down.
Smells:  Fruit fruit and more fruit.  Citrus is apparent.  So are other more tropical fruits.  But there is so much I can' separate them all out.  Fruity Pebbles could learn a thing or two from this beer.
Tastes:  More of that fruit.  Sweetness up front.  Hops on the back.  Neither one asserts itself over the other.  They seem to be getting along OK.  *shhhh*  Just let them be.  They'll be OK.
Feels:  A thick and tangy blanket for my tongue.  So heavy I keep making chewing motions with my jaw.  Scientists would say I'm trying to macerate it.  Scientists are dumb and use too many big words.  Just drink it.
Overall:  This is a pretty amazing beer.  It is overwhelming on all characteristics.  Yet somehow it all seems to balance out.  This might be the beer that was spoken of in days of old before mankind lost his way and began writing things down! 1,252 charactersdshiplet, Nov 29, 2016

Almost spot on pulp free orange juice in colour and mouthfeel. 
Opening the can was like exploding a hop bomb. Aromas came straight to my nose. Fresh orange citrus hop explosion. Flavour was extremely balance between malts and hops. It was hard to drink it slow. Really an incredible well crafted brew. Possibly a desert island beer contender! 458 charactersdabeerbuddha, Nov 20, 2016

4.96/5  rDev +6.9%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5This is the first beer that showed me the wonders of the NE IPA.  Pours kinda thick and sits a hazy yellow orange in the glass.  Almost looks like orange juice with a touch of blood orange juice with a ring of head that lingers around the edges and at splotches floating on top.  Smell is something unique.  Smells of tropical fruit: passion fruit predominates but you also gets notes of guava and mango.  The nose on this beer is what really makes it world class; how can you get so much fruit smell with not fruit!?  The taste is just generally juicy with a pleasantly bitter finish.   Sweet and fruity on the front end with no clear flavor coming through other than tropical punch.  Really balanced and not too bitter on the back like some other beers.  The body on this beer has heavy gravity that feels thick yet it is not sticky and goes down light and smooth.  This is one leg of the Treehouse Triumvirate that really has no clear leader.  They are all amazing in their own right and very unique. 1,003 charactersAmguerra305, Nov 18, 2016

4.54/5  rDev -2.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Looks are sublime, as is the reputation for this beer. It pours a completely opaque orange, with a finger of white, tight-laced head. Lacing formation is fantastic, forming spiderweb after spiderweb around the edge of the snifter after each sip. While I hate to use the clique in describing this beer, I really cannot find better words - this beer looks like orange juice. Aroma notes are dripping with citrus and orange. A faint back bone of biscuit malts and pine resin hops support the otherwise Vitamin C-like aroma. Flavor notes are gorgeous, at least a second or so after a sip. Initial flavor notes include a sticky, bitter resin hop, before smoothing out into, you guessed it, citrus and orange hops. The after taste is a lingering, bitter pine resin that sticks around like sap on fingers. The beer really shines mid flavor profile, but otherwise is a bit bitter. Mouth feel is somewhere between strange and great. While the beer itself has a medium to medium-thick texture and consistency, an overwhelming amount of particulates invade and blast the tongue almost like drinking a fine sand - or flour. Otherwise, the mouth feel makes it fun to drink. Overall, it's a well performing beer with plenty going for it. While the initial and lingering flavor notes keep this beer from being an easy first timers IPA, it still is easy to drink. I can only imagine it would be slightly better if it were a few days fresher (it is a week old).

5/5  rDev +7.8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5All Hail Julius! 
Look: Super Hazy, no light gets through at all. Deep Orange in color.
Smell. Orange, Orange, and more Orange! Like an Orange Creamsicle. Simply the best expression of citrusy hops I've ever had.
Taste: Everything on the nose transfers to the mouth. Super orange flavor with just a little bit of tropical fruit(passion fruit/pineapple) poking through. Just a little bitterness on the finish.
Feel: Mouth-feel is super creamy but the bitterness keeps the beer from weighing on the palate the way some sweeter beers do.
Overall(Style points): Before having this beer I preferred tropical fruit notes to citrus in my IPA but Julius has won me over. 100 points! 679 charactersMikeyMcD86, Oct 30, 2016

4.64/5  rDev 0%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 16oz can into a teku glass.  Pours a thick, yellow-orange.  Opaque like juice.  The nose is dominated by mango, papaya, and pineapple.  The fruit on the nose is far more tropical and robust than most IPAs, and is accompanied by faint hop background.  The palate reveals an exceptional IPA (dank, resinous, and distinctly west-coast) hiding underneath a smoothie-like wall of fruit (with the same flavor notes indicated in the nose).  The mouthfeel is thick.  Strangely thick for an IPA.  This is an incredible way to push the style, and the beer is truly well-crafted.  It would be hard for any beer to live up to the hype this one has gotten, and whether or not it does is certainly up for debate.  Nonetheless, hype aside, it's a beer that has no trouble standing on its own merits. 798 charactersLAp, Oct 28, 2016

A: A very thick orange color which was rather hazy. One finger of foamy white head and lacing on entire glass. 
S: Strong burst of tropical fruit as soon as the can opened. Orange, grapefruit, and tangerine were the strongest but some pineapple in there too. Just enough hop to remind you it was there 
T: Juice, juice and more juice. Exactly like the smell and superbly blended with the hops. Taste was the same from first drink until the last. 
F: A medium juice with a crisp tart taste. 
O: One of the best IPAs I have had. I believe the hype after finally trying one. Ridiculous amount of fruit taste with hops I loved. Getting ready for another one. 754 charactersKdouble, Oct 26, 2016

L:  A super cloudy murky medium orange color with a beautiful white one finger head.  Nice lacing that does recede.  
S:  Wow, I was expecting tropical and got huge citrus on the nose.  Nice!  Massive grapefruit, tangerine, orange, peach and some pineapple.  I get som slight grassy notes too.  Smells awesome!  
T:  The citrus follows the nose.  Grapefruit, orange, tangerine and lemon zest.  Slight (ever so) pineapple and stone fruit mix with a bit of grass.  Malt is bread and cracker like and the finish stays citrus with some drying bitterness.  Finish is divine as it is not too bitter but not even near sweet.  Crazy good.  Memorable.  
M:  Medium, slightly prickly, smooth but dry.  Nice carbonation with very slight alcohol as it warms.  So good.
O:  Another reviewer said this one cannot quite hold up to the top NE beers from Trillium, etc.  I have not had any Trillium beers yet (I do have one in ice to try very soon)  but I can't imagine a beer that this one can't hold up next to.  What a truly awesome beer very much deserving it's hype.  Awesome!  PS.  Attn traders, I will need more of this stunning beer. 1,221 charactersKadonny, Oct 25, 2016

At the beginning, it tastes like oranges with a little bit of sourdough tang, tropical and fruity on the back end and a yeasty, bready, orangey aftertaste. Usually I get bitterness early and then acclimate - here the bitterness starts coming out the more you drink it. Medium body, carbonation hits you up front then turns more slick and creamy. 456 charactersaquabears, Oct 24, 2016

4.45/5  rDev -4.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Tree House Julius
A: This incredibly-hyped modern classic lives up to its name in appearance: this looks like full-pulp orange juice or even a fruit smoothie. The pure white head is unfortunately short-lived, but lacing is nice and in light sheets. The color is beautiful, but the head and retention and lacing. 4/5
A: Peach, grapefruit, and orange aromas dominate in a big way. Some green hoppiness lies underneath, but this is all about the dominant citrusy fruit that lies in every facet. Doughy malt is mostly hidden, along with a little yeastiness. It is a little one-note in just how overt the juiciness is, but it is also extremely impressive in its intensity. 4.5/5
T: Unsurprisingly, the taste largely follows the aroma with ridiculous orange juice and ripe peach, sweet but not too sweet. Grapefruit hits mid-palate with the new entry of guava and some surprising grassy bitterness. There is a little sweet pineapple and a touch of alcohol sweetness on the very end where the doughy malts and English yeast make their very slight presence known. This does not suffer like many Tree House beers from an "unfinished," heavily doughy, grainy, and floury taste. This is a knockout beer that would improve with just a tad more complexity. 4.5/5
M: Moderate mouthfeel, a little on the lighter side, but not to its detriment, just a little bit off of the admittedly nascent style. Carbonation is typically soft, bitterness is light and dryness is equally light, leaving a little stickiness on the lips. It is not all that refreshing (not many NE IPAs are), but it is a treat to drink. 4.25/5
O: This one is worth the hype. Despite the sameness that Tree House (and other NE IPAs) can get muddled into, Julius stands out with some of the best. It is not the best of the style (that title belongs to Hill Farmstead or Trillium), but this is a wonderful beer, and at that echelon, it is really splitting hairs. Pair with A Lot Like Birds "Conversation Piece," which, while great, is not among the absolute top tier of post-hardcore. 4.5/5 2,043 charactersTHANAT0PSIS, Oct 21, 2016
4.64/5  rDev 0%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5L: Exactly what a New England IPA should look like. Personally I don't care for the hazy look but can't fault the style. Nice billowy tangerine head.
S: Probably the single greatest aspect of this beer. I cannot step smelling it. I've probably sniffed it 3x as much as I've sipped it. So much tropical fruit. I'm pretty sure a lot of that character is coming from the yeast esters but it works so well in concert with the hops.
T: My can is well over a month old but it still holds up. Light and unassuming with a fruit punch. It would be the perfect everyday beer if it were that available.
F: Billowy and oh so soft on the palette. Plenty of carbonation but it feels almost marshmallowy instead of champagney.
O: I get it. I'd love to get a super fresh one. Pretty fantastic beer. 786 charactersMalarkeyMcGee, Oct 21, 2016

A: Pours a very hazy, dull orange color with a one-inch, foamy, white head with good retention. Thick, white, billowy lacing throughout.
S: Strong notes of tropical fruits and citrus consisting of pineapple, mango, melons, tangerine, grapefruit, and orange. Very slight piney hop and sweet malt notes.
T: Huge juice bomb! Taste matches aromas almost exactly. Tropical fruit and citrus notes of pineapple, mango, peach, melons, grapefruit, and tangerine. Fruitiness is perfectly balanced with piney hop bitterness.
F: Light-medium bodied, smooth, juice-like, and crisp with good carbonation.
O: Overall, this is hands down the best IPA I've had to date. Treehouse just has an unbelievable ability to produce these unparalleled, unique IPA/IIPA's. Ridiculously fruity and juicy, but perfectly balanced with hop bitterness. Easy drinking. Lives up to every bit of the hype and holds the title of #1 for a reason. Would love to try this fresher and will definitely be chasing this in the future. 1,055 charactersBeerGuy8315, Oct 15, 2016

3.88/5  rDev -16.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4Either this batch is not their best or the New England reviewers and the brothers are losing sight of what's good. This beer has not lived up to the hype. It's unique but not in all good ways. This batch was made September 27th, 2016.
The look is a standard unfiltered hazy New England IPA, goldenrod in color with nice white head and good lacing. I'm not a huge fan of suspended proteins and polyphenols in my IPAs but it doesn't totally take away from the look.
The nose is POG (passion, orange, guava) with hints pineapple, pine needles and bark. An intriguing combination.
The flavor profile is a little different from the nose with the primary taste being orange peel with notes of pineapple and pine. There is a subtle metallic taste as well. There is a lingering heat to this beer which is odd because it's not a high point beer. Again interesting but not necessarily in a good way.
The mouthfeel is very nice. Medium bodied beer with just the right amount of carbonation.
Overall, it tastes good but not world-class. Next to no standard IPA features in this beer and the unique features are not all pleasant. 1,121 charactersTheBeerCarl, Oct 02, 2016

4.2/5  rDev -9.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25Canned date of 07/19/16
Appearance - Pours thickly hazed and dull orange as a result, with an off-white, finger width head. Fair retention, peeling back to reveal a mostly barren layer of suds and a thin ring around the edge of the glass. 
Smell - Aroma is tropical, with notes of orange, pineapple, mango, guava and a hint of grapefruit. A bit of leaf. Faint, crackery malt somewhere in there.
Taste - Follows the nose a bit. Juicy notes of orange with lesser pineapple and mango upfront.  A bit of stonefruit pit nuttiness hits mid-taste. Some lightly toasted malt. Pithy orange and lesser grapefruit on the finish.
Mouthfeel - Medium-bodied with moderate carbonation. Silky smooth, almost creamy mouthfeel that lends itself to an easy, quaffable drink. 
Overall - Pretty damn tasty, but I prefer Substance and Yojo to this, both of which have a sharper bite on the finish. Still, one I won't pass up if I ever get another chance to get it. 947 charactersTheSixthRing, Sep 25, 2016

Pours a beautiful Hazy golden orange, with no light penetration. Egg white colored, half finger head with spotty lacing. Very juice like looking beer! Orange Julius to be exact lol. 
Smells like the juiciest fruit your nose has ever smelled. Angels tears to be exact. Monster aromas of grapefruit, orange, pineapple with a wicked hop kick!! My goodness. 
Taste like mega juicy orange juice, with pineapple and grapefruit present. Very sweet and balance with a hidden hop kick that gets you in the face, then runs away. Definetly one of the best beers I have had. It is way too juicy for its own good! 
Fairly light bodied with decent carbonation. Slighty dry while being juicy, finish. Pretty awesome right there. 
Easily one of the best beers I've ever tasted. Wish I had an unlimited supply! 849 charactersDrinkThemAll, Sep 21, 2016

My IPA quest has reached its culmination with this beer. I cannot imagine a more delicious IPA (although I'm hoping the growler of Green and can of Alter Ego sitting in my fridge might give Julius a run for its money). I drank a can of King Julius the night before enjoying this growler, and for me Julius was superior in two ways: head retention/lacing, and virtually on alcohol discernible in the taste or aroma. Not a traditional IPA by any means but this beer is perfection nevertheless. 524 charactersLucular, Sep 12, 2016

4.85/5  rDev +4.5%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75I'm on a ratings tear here. 
Julius rules, but that's not a long enough review. 
Instead of describing tropical and juice with ten different fruits I'll go the narrative route. 
Julius is hands down the definition of the "NE IPA." Juicy. Tropical juice. Cloudy. Unbelievable mouthfeel. Smell you can clock from across the room. 
It sets the standard for what the ultimate IPA is today. 
If you look at the ratings of the other beers that dominated this list a few years ago, you can see (or read about) shifting taste preferences over time. 
You can taste the difference against Dinner or Pliny the Elder or even Focal (I'm grateful for having had the chance). 
All of those beers are spectacular. 
But Julius, and the Treehouse catalogue, shaves the bitter off and enhances the mouthfeel, making for a (weird word coming) luxurious experience. 
My goodness I love it. Second only to Alter Ego. 
At least for now. 923 charactersChinzon, Sep 06, 2016

Tree House Brewing Company
Appearance:
Thick and murky. Similar to a really chunky homemade apple cider, but more opaque. The lacing is a vibrant chunky mural that might turn to concrete if you let it sit.
Smell: 
The second the first gaseous particles released the can it was in my nose from 3 ft. away full of pine, citrus, and tart.
Taste:
Wildly subtle and pleasant up front for the incredible complexity. Quickly follows with orange, bitter citrus, sweet citrus, sweet hop, and tangy peach. Similar to a fruit bucket with only your favorite citrusy things.
Mouthfeel: 
About as chalky and opaque as it looks in texture it is on your tongue, although chalky in the best possible sense.
Overall: 5/5 
No doubt about it. While I'm not sure how I'm supposed to forget about this beer I'm at least incredibly thankful to have tried it. It's the best IPA that I've ever had. 881 charactersTjMosby, Sep 04, 2016

Pours hazy orange with a half-inch white head that remains as a ring on top and leaves thick strands of lace. Literally looks like orange juice with foam. The smell is of bitter citrus fruit with just a hint of tropical fruit. The taste follows with grapefruit and orange peel. Medium texture with a prickly effervescence.

Look:  Hazy light orange in color. About one finger head. Nice lacing. 
Smell:  Best smelling IPA I've ever smelled. Right there with Heady and Psuedo Sue. Total citrus aroma. 
Taste:  Perfect. Orange juice bomb. A little bitterness (wish there was more like Green) but an amazing taste nonetheless. 
Feel:  perfect mouthfeel. Super smooth. Not too thin and not creamy.  
Overall:  an incredible IPA that lives up to the hype.  I just amended my rating. I had another can of this but don't know how old it was. It was good but not great. This 4 day old can is perfection. 672 charactersTonyLuvsBeer, Aug 30, 2016

Drank / Review 8.13
Beer pours a cloudy golden orange - similar to the color of the Julius Can - its thick, dense, light cannot pass through - Looks like a cup of thick dank hop juice.   This beer smells like heaven.   Strong fruit notes throughout a smell of citrus and mango.   Its extremely drinkable, almost too drinkable.   Tastes good, refreshing, clean, has a hop bite, but its subtle, the fruit notes definitely stand out, but not in a bad way.
This beer is all the craze right now and I can see why - Treehouse is doing an amazing job brewing this.   I thoroughly enjoyed it and will be making another trip to Monson, MA to obtain more variations of Treehouse beers.
The beer is amazing, but not life changing.   Not the best beer I ever had, but its right up there.   Try this beer if you can and enjoy as fresh as possible. 852 charactersFinestofNewEngland, Aug 15, 2016

L: 2F+ head with very strong retention, lacing, cap, and ring. Beer is a very hazy orange-bronze.
S: Fantastic. Mango, orange, grapefruit, lime, and passionfruit. Some hints of dank, earthy, piney, grassy finish to come.
T: Strongly follows what is indicated by the nose, good dry finish after the dank pineyness.
F: Medium-bodied, light to medium carbonation. Drinkable because it tastes great, but too complex and heavy to pound (so just enjoy the great experience, that's my advice). Construction and balance are top-notch.
O: Well, it certainly lives up to the reputation. I've rated a couple of beers higher, but we're just talking tiny degrees. Certainly worth standing in long lines for. 828 charactersIvoryFoxhole, Aug 09, 2016

Pours a glorious, deep, hazy orange, with a substantial, long lingering head.  Nose is citrus, melon, with hints of sweet malt.  Taste is citrus, melon, combining a massive hop blast with fruity esters.  Mouthfeel is soft and smooth.  It's a really fine ipa, but despite reputation not my very favorite Treehouse beer, nor, strong as it is, my very favorite ipa.  But I've only got one can and my experience with Tree House so far is that ever tasting of one of their beers gives me a fuller appreciation.  I'd certainly grab a chance to have this again! 599 charactersprofessorchow, Aug 01, 2016

Poured a citrus orange haze with about a finger of white head and decent lacing.  The aromas of citrus abound making this a tropical cocktail until your first sip, then you realize it's beer!  Living up in Pliny country and getting this beer via trading really makes me appreciate the craft at both coastlines. This beer tasted smooth and citrusy and refreshing on a hot California Saturday!

Aroma is suprsingly restrained but features tropical fruits and a light crackery malt. Lots of great flavors here, tons of tropical and citrus fruits. I get peach, tangerine, mango, and some melon. Great mouthfeel, pillowy without being too full, very easy to drink. Definitely my favorite of Tree House's staple beers. It has only a hint of the melonly flavor that perceive in their all their NE IPAs that I've had to date; in their other offerings that flavor overwhelms, here it is subtle and helps contribute to the orange creamsicle vibe. 612 charactersmnj21655, Jul 28, 2016

I thought some of the Aslin beers were of similar quality. 359 charactersOmahaKF, Jul 25, 2016

S-DANK DANK DANK. If they made cologne that smelled like this beer I'd be that guy spray myself 25x a morning. Smells similar to how I think heaven will.
T-Juice, hop, floral on repeat. Did I mention juice/hop/floral? The taste lives up to the ravaging smell. Great tag team combo akin to The Legion of Doom.
F-Dare I say dangerously drinkable? It's been like 900 degrees the last 2 weeks and this could be the go to beverage post lawn mow/trim. Sits light and goes down like melted hoppy floral butter sprinkled with smiles and kittens.
O-If you can't tell, this is my favorite beer ever (thru 7.23.16)(subject to future change). But you probably won't like it so if you come across any just send to me and I'll dispose accordingly to save you from disappointment/regret. ;) <--winky face 876 charactersMichaelmartin85, Jul 23, 2016

A: Pours a glorious, almost entirely opaque dark orange (very similar hue to the darker shade of orange on the can, actually!). Soft puffy heady of tiny bubbles sticks around nicely. Thick lacing up the glass.
S: Bready yeast dominates, with heavy tropical notes of ripe peach, mango, and tangerine. Aromas really come out as it warms a bit.
T: Typical Tree House candied, bubble-gum-esque yeast up front. Then, the 'melange of citrus'... Orange and tangerine without the pucker-worthy astringency. Just straight up juice. Bit of piney herbaceousness shows up on the finish to perfectly round out the flavor profile. Julius is pretty much in a league of its own here.
M: Slightly thinner than Green and Alter Ego. Dangerously drinkable--not the slightest hint of alcohol. Medium minus bitterness on the finish with a touch of dryness makes you crave another sip almost immediately. Totally juice-like in terms of its drinkability.
O: My fourth Tree House beer after Alter Ego, Green, and Bright, in terms of ranking, Julius is second only to Green, in my opinion. It epitomizes the diverse flavor profile that Tree House has mastered--a perfect blend of tropical fruit, candied yeast, and floral, drying bitterness. If I'm going to get nit-picky, the mouthfeel isn't quite as full as Green, and the fruitiness isn't quite as in-your-face-from-the-first-sip. But it's for sure one of the tastiest and most beautiful IPAs I've ever had. 1,521 charactersavas, Jul 16, 2016

Smells of grapefruit, lemon zest, orange peel, pineapple, guava, papaya, tropical fruit, caramel, brown sugar, clementine, peach, floral hops, white pepper, mango, coriander, toasted grains, biscuit, green apple, sweet malt and graham cracker. Some piney hops come through and add to the delicious citrus hoppy sweetness, bringing out more complexities as it warms. Really fresh smelling and quite inviting, as the hops burst out of the glass. 
Taste has more biscuit, toasted grains, breads malts and graham cracker than the nose, with a strong citrus hop zest that showcases grapefruit, lemon, clementine, pineapple and dank piney hops. The second wave of flavor is packed with tropical fruit like papaya, guava and starfruit, easing into sharp floral hop spices with pepper, light coriander and brown sugar mixing in right before the citrus bitterness washes it all down. Nice level of bitterness to mask the ABV and still let the malt backbone maintain balance. The hops all taste super fresh and juicy, really well done in every way. Incredibly easy to drink.
Mouthfeel is creamy and almost buttery smooth, with mild carbonation, a medium body that leans towards chewy, letting the near perfect bitterness help it flow down and leave a hoppy aftertaste that's full of citrus fruit, malty sweetness and nice light floral spices. The line to get this growler was ridiculously long, but the beer is outstanding and worth the wait. This lived up to the hype for me. 1,683 charactersCHickman, Jul 09, 2016

4.67/5  rDev +0.6%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Two fingers of creamy white foam, that slowly settle into about a quarter inch of pillowy goodness.  Beautiful opaque orange, almost glows in the sunlight.
Smells of peach, sweet orange, guava, mango.  True fruit bomb.
This is a hop showcase...all the flavors of the nose are present...not much of a malt backbone, but that's okay.  It's the beer equivalent of biting into a ripe nectarine.
Nice level of carbonation, a little on the dry side, very drinkable. 462 charactersTrojanRB, Jul 04, 2016

4.94/5  rDev +6.5%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Beer was sampled from a can and growler, both less than a week old. Review is from notes.
The growler Taste was off and I suspect it may have baked in a warehouse for too long during shipping, so the review will be for the canned Julius.
L: Unfiltered almost opaque orange color, what NE IPA are known for.
S: smell was subdued, not as strong as Very Hazy, only area lacking perfection.
T: Like a thick tropical juice, with a pleasant start, super smooth middle, and easy finish.
F: This was where the beer really blew me away, tingly sensation, the subtle bitterness blended with the tropical flavor felt just right.
O: The best NE style IPA I've had to date. I've found myself comparing all other NE IPAs against the perfect flavor curve that starts off evenly, peaks very high, then lets you down easy that Julius should be known for. 843 charactersSpamalot, Jun 29, 2016

3.96/5  rDev -14.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4Look, this beer is legendary after only a few years. There's no doubt that it's truly unique. I don't think any other beer tastes quite like it. I had my first one back in August of 2015, and while it was very good at the time, I think I let the hype around it build it up to be something that frankly, no beer can be. 
In the (almost) year since my first Julius I fought long and hard to make a trip to Treehouse for more. In the interim friends brought me Haze, Doppleganger, and Alter Ego, all of which I liked very much. The taste of Julius faded from my memory but the idea of Julius just grew bigger and bigger in my mind. 
Last weekend I finally had the chance to grab a growler of Julius from Treehouse. The trip was a mixed experience. Lines were long, parking attendants were grumpy, servers were overwhelmed, but it was a beautiful day so standing in line a bit didn't matter. At last, there it was. Approaching the first pour from my growler with all the anticipation of a sixteen-year-old boy with his girlfriend at his house and his parents out for the first time, I was . . . underwhelmed. Sure it's good. But it doesn't quite taste like beer should taste to me.  When people describe this beer as tasting like orange juice they are not exaggerating. We always read that this or that beer smells like mango or peach, grass or brine . . . whatever. And sure we can imagine some of that in those brews. But really, Julius does taste and feel a lot like orange juice. I can imagine Nate Lanier, original brewer of Julius, rubbing his hands together and laughing like a mad scientist as he realizes that he has concocted the perfect potion. It's beer, but wait, it tastes like juice. 
For this alone you have to try it. Nothing else comes close to the actual flavor and texture of Julius. It is one of a kind. I do find it very, very sweet though. Perhaps my palate has changed in the months since I first tasted it but there are several IPAs and double IPAs that I like more. 
For it's uniqueness I would give it a 10/10. And kind of like the way that everyone should really try the uni with the quail egg on top the first time they eat sushi, just because . . . I think everyone who likes beer should try Julius. But for overall taste and drinkability, it's not something I would reach for regularly or even go out of my way for again. 2,352 charactersdms, Jun 27, 2016

Very strong grapefruit rind aroma.  A touch of fruitiness and evergreen.  Powerful.
It looks thicker than the mouthfeel suggests.  Good carbonation with an above average richness.  Strong, biting citrus bitters in the swallow.  Very little malt start--this is hop forward beer in every way.  Loooong aftertaste.  It doesn't fit into the extreme category, but the alcohol is warming and subtly present.  It would be a "go back to" easily but may not crack my top ten. 583 characterssmcolw, Jun 25, 2016

L - Poured into Weizen (hey it's what I got lol).  Dark burnt orange color very solid, no transparency whatsoever
S - Dank, tropical, orange, pineapple, juice.  
T - citrus explosion so damn good
F - smooth as a babies bottom (I can say that I'm a new Dad)

Chugga-chugga-chugga, CHOO-CHOO! Hype train is coming through. This has been at the top of my desired attainable beers list for a while, and I finally got it today. There isn't anything that I can say about this that hasn't been repeated a thousand times in previous reviews, but I DID want to comment on just how drinkable this is. It's seriously like a citrus hop juice. Very smooth and not in any way harsh on the palate. Just overall awesome! 481 charactersLloydDobler, Jun 22, 2016

4.7/5  rDev +1.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Riding in with much acclaim, the bright and juicy American standard-strength IPA is fabled to boast the perfect medley of orange, mango and passionfruit character from hops alone more so than any thus far. Regardless of any place on a totem pole, excellence is expected.
And the excellence in Julius is realized starting with a creamy peach and golden blend of colors and airy textures. The beer's muddy appearance only works to make it more appetizing. Slow separation of ale to froth suggests a viscous character that carries over to a creamy, tangy, sweet and fruity taste just after a grassy, citrusy, herbal and piney scent starts the show.
Less grassy and herbal in taste, the flavors that blossom on the middle palate are abundant with all-things-orange. Tangerine, in all its tangy, fructose-sweet, vibrant glory springs to life with a zesty support of red grapefruit, lemon and lime. Tantalizing tropical fruits join the taste with pineapple and kiwi nuances. Smooth in the beer's fleeting taste, a sense of bitter sherbet with citrus rinds apply their final and lasting impressions.
Creamy and dry, the taste starts fullish and semi-dry, but trailing bitter, resinous and dry, the soft sappiness of freshly shaven pine links up with fragrant citrus peel for an evaporative texture and a nearly teeth-churning creamy tartness that aligns with sherbet desserts- if only those came in a high bitter version with near seven-percent alcohol to boot. 1,457 charactersBEERchitect, Jun 15, 2016

Sharp citrus flesh and ripe mango.  A touch of underlying grass.
Follows the nose.  Intense, but well balanced ripe, tropical fruit - mango, pineapple, and papaya.  Underlying citrus flesh, specifically orange, and some citrus pith for bitterness.  Finish is more ripe fruit and citrus pith.  Tons of depth, but still well-balanced.
Full-bodied.  Medium carbonation.  Soft.  Slightly sweet and sticky finish. 504 charactersAirBob, Jun 02, 2016

Julius is a hazy tangerine color with an incredible aroma and an off white finger head that lingers. Taste follows the nose, a tropical bomb of mango, tangerine, with absolute perfect balance.  This beer is crushable and a true delight. . 289 charactersNEBeer92, Jun 01, 2016

This beer is absolutely superb. The visuals are unspectacular but typical of this style and are quickly overlooked once the taste explosion starts.
Have to admit it was worth the 1.25 hour ride, 45 minute wait in line and dealing  with pretentious beer attendants to get 10 cans but I will be back in line soon. I thought it was hilarious when we were in line and one of the treehouse constables came out to warn us that they were on the lookout for folks that were "sneaking" back in line for more beer....10 more cans....you can't make this s up....I pray that these guys don't screw this up when they move to the new brewery. 736 charactersReegze79, May 27, 2016

4.16/5  rDev -10.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4100% opaque, Julius looks like peach juice with a large bubbly white spongy head that settles down to a relatively thick, creamy top layer leaving behind a good amount of wavy lace.
Aromas of vanilla orange cream with some spicy pine, and a little candy, like Pez. There is a hint of cannabic dankness, but it manages to deliver a ton of fresh hops without stepping too heavily into that territory.
Flavors of bright citrus awaken the senses with some refreshing acidity. Julius manages to kick the tropical and fruity flavors up a notch over what the nose telegraphs, and more than most any other IPA that tries to mimic it, without being cloying, overboard or artificially juicy. Flavors of orange mango, marmalade abound with young, green pine, and spicy lemon lime.
Julius finishes dry, bittersweet, with a touch of cracker, and a frothy, creamy mouthfeel. 863 charactersSabtos, May 26, 2016

First few sips were near perfect, but by the time i got to my second pint a lot of the initial flavors were muted. I know this can happen with any beer, but typically doesn't happen to me with Tree House. Great for one, but not as session-able as I was hoping. 
Overall, this is unquestionably a very good beer. Next time I will be seeking out cans, so I can have one at a time instead of having to rush through an open growler. 473 charactersRaff1150, May 23, 2016

S: Cheese and rice...you can smell the citrus and hops feet away from the glass...more fruit than you can shake yer stick at. Plenty of tropical, stone and citrus fruit. Nice malt in the nose too.
T: Maltier and bigger than expected, but the malt recedes quickly to tons of bright and citrusy hops with a touch of resin on the back end. Big bold flavor with a touch of ethanol. 
M: Thicker than expected; coats the mouth thoroughly and doesn't let go.

M- a little heavier than your typical iPa, it feels thicker, like drinking orange juice with the pulp, I can understand why some people would call this "pillowy", alcohol is covered, aftertaste is orange rind
O- world class for sure, I wouldn't call it perfect though, the over pulpy orange juice beer thing honestly gets old after a bit, it leaves me wanting something more dank, or a big dark roasty stout or vanilla/oak loaded bba beer, but that's just me I guess 754 charactersHopHunter19, May 11, 2016

4.53/5  rDev -2.4%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5This beer is just fantastic as I have had it many times.
Canned 4/12/16 and drank on 5/3/16.  I echo what a lot of people seem to say about Julius FROM A CAN as it is best drank right before 3 weeks.  If you get it in a growler, please god drink it fast as it doesn't last as long.  
Looks like the lighter yellow/orange color on the can in a glass.  Smell is just incredible when it is 3 weeks out like it literally smells like a ripe tangerine.  Mouth feel is just a tad watery compared to other DIPAs and other unique beers they offer.  Taste is just ... it is what I love about Tree House.  It's all about that creamy mouth feel as no other brewery does it quite like TH.  Also please people, let this beer warm up for 30 minutes outside the fridge ... it opens it up dramatically and makes the experience that much better.
Overall.  I'm spoiled.  I get to drive 1 hour to TH when I want thanks to a flexible work schedule and get these when I feel like it.  This beer should be on your bucket list and it is worth it to travel to TH at least once.  Great people and great beer. 1,085 charactersBEEPOP, May 03, 2016

Huge thanks to Goblinmunkey7 for the hookup
A: Pale orange with tangerine and honey around the edges - murky and turbid, as one would expect from any Tree House IPA - pours with a medium-sized, white head, fades to a wispy cap, maintains a small collar and leaves spots and streaks of lacing
S: In a word, juice - or maybe a cup of fruit soaked in fruit juice - extraordinarily juicy, bursting with citrus and tropical fruits - orange and tangerine flesh, juice, with some ruby red grapefruit - floral and flowery citrus - hop resin - fleshy chunks of tropical fruits, including melon, mango, passion fruit, and pineapple - touch of herbal hop aroma as this warms up - some light bread at the base - vaguely sweet-smelling, but it may just be the fruity aromas
T: Basically, this is effervescent tropical fruit juice, just with some additional complexity - waves of citrus, with tangerine, orange, and ruby red grapefruit juice, flesh, touches of zest - some herbal and flowery flavors - huge tropical component, with mango, melon, pineapple, and a touch of stone fruit - low to medium bitterness with some lingering oily bitterness - malts at the base lend some hints of bread and light crackers - mostly dry
M: Medium body, medium carbonation, smooth and "fuzzy," mostly dry but also lightly oily finish
O: Is canning tropical fruit juice and calling it beer an ethical thing to do?
I've been excited to try this one for quite some time. Did it live up to the hype? Well, my head did not explode after my first sip, so I guess not... Julius is quite lovely, but I might actually prefer it's alter ego (appropriately named Alter Ego). The fruit juice aroma and flavor is amazing, but the fruitiness is almost one dimensional. Maybe I'm just grasping at straws. Just find this and drink it for yourself.
Update: June 2017
I've had more than a few cans from a few different batches since I wrote this review. And the batch variation is interesting. Cans seem to range from excellent to objectively mind-blowing. I am upping the overall score to 4.75. 2,074 charactersangrybabboon, May 03, 2016

It's pretty much has all citrus and mango tasting notes with a nice bitter hit of hops that isn't overpowering. Is it the best IPA out there? No. I prefer an IPA that can give you some piney, dank and even sour flavors. Is it the best one dimensional juice bomb of an IPA?  Quite possibly. 421 charactersELS, May 02, 2016

One of the more juicier ipas in terms of taste.  Feel is spot-on for the style.  Medium carb and body. 342 characterslemmy187, May 01, 2016

Pours a bright hazy orange with about a half finger of head. This beer looks and smells like orange juice...but way better...its insane...it smells insane. The taste follows suit with a mild grassy hop bitterness that compliments this beer in every way but for the most part it's all juice...pillowy soft ridiculous hoppy juice. I'm sure this beer isn't for everyone but it is for me. I still prefer Green over Julius  but to me they are both world class beers. 566 charactersMcGee666, Apr 28, 2016

It's really hard to find any flaws with this.  Nice haze/turbid appearance, with orange juice color.  Aroma is delightfully citrusy.  Juicy taste! Mango, passion fruit, citrus in general. Super smooth and crushable end.  In my opinion, best IPA out there.  Can't really imagine how this IPA can be improved upon. 365 characterseifster82, Apr 28, 2016

Appearance - The appearance is every bit as hazy as Tree House's reputation portends. The beer itself has a pretty sunburst color, almost radiant even, which may even be accentuated by the opaqueness of the liquid. It essentially resembles pineapple juice. The head is clumpy and dense and leaves a blanket of lace behind as it recedes.
Aroma - The aroma is pungent and fresh, ripe with tropical notes and a toss of grass and perhaps the slightest hint of green onion. Mango and pineapple lead the way on the tropical front.
Taste - The flavor very much resembles the aroma, especially the mango and even some passion fruit. Except here, I'm not getting that overwhelming juiciness that made the aroma so enticing. It just seems muted and a bit more grassiness comes through, especially in the finish where a hop bite is starkly noticeable.
Mouthfeel - The mouthfeel is actually very nice and fits perfectly with the the style and the hops. It is soft and pillowy, allowing the flavors to slowly rest and develop on the palate. I would perhaps want a little more carbonation, but it's possible the canned version displays more.
Closing Arguments - Overall this a solid IPA for sure. I tried this in a blind tasting a few weeks ago and it finished near the bottom of the pack (in a field of other impressive IPAs, to be fair), but I wanted to give it another look with a fresh palate. My thoughts now echo mine then - a nice beer but not one that lives up to the hype or trouble needed to get it. In defense of Tree House, we had Lights On that same tasting and it was the near unanimous winner in its field, so this isn't a hit piece on Tree House. 1,677 charactersnhindian, Apr 28, 2016

3.62/5  rDev -22%look: 3 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 2.75 |  overall: 3.5This isn't a beer, it's a gimmick. OK, it is a beer by definition, but it's still a gimmick. The bright fruitiness is infatuating, but lacks the complexities of other beers in the category (American DIPA). 
Tasted 2 weeks after purchasing fresh from the brewery. Poured into a tulip glass, and let warm up a few minutes. It's a great beer, not sure if it's worth the effort or price. Copious amount of late addition hops don't create the complexity that other DIPAs have. The rage is really about the fruitiness, insanely intense flavors, without the bitterness. 
L: Opaque/cloudy, this is the new normal for this region and I'm still getting used to it. Orangish copper. This amount of cloudiness makes me nervous about the yeast farts I'll have later tonight. I actually wonder if it really is suspended yeast or maybe they mixed some highly refined flour into the beer or something. (I've had some of this beer that sat for several months before tasting and it was just as cloudy and limited sediment)
S: No different from the other reviewers: tropical fruits such as passion fruit (or, passion fruit nectar, I've never smelled real passion fruit), apricot, and a hint of pine tree resin. Still nervous about the smell of the farts I may have later.  Good thing I'm already married.
T: Lots of tropical/Hawaiian fruit nectar, but a bit more bitter than nectar. I kind of feel like if I want a glass of tropical fruit or Hawaiian fruit juice I would get a glass of that. But this is drier, not crisp but balanced. As the flavor dissipates, piney notes come forward. Then you get the bitterness. But not a lot.
M: Thick. It's dry so doesn't leave a residue, though there is some oiliness from all the hops, and the flavor lingers a long time. 
O: There's a lot of hype about this beer. But it's clearly a trick of late hopping a copious amount of hops. The flavor is unique compared to other high profile American DIPAs, but there isn't a complexity that I would expect. 1,973 charactersGeeL, Apr 24, 2016

Pours a bright hazy goldenrod. With a striking white head.
Smells juicy and fruity.  Almost more peach and mango than citrus. 
Hits the pallet with a burst of juice.  Sweet and fruity, once again more mango and peach notes then citrus.  The mid pallet is pleasantly grassy, and it leaves just a hint of pine bite at the end.  The juiciness lingers in the mouth with a hint of hop character.
Given the number of times I have used juicy in this review Julius is not just a cleaver name.  Either that, or the name provides an incredible priming effect. 589 charactersAbe_Froman, Apr 18, 2016

Pour is a cloudy, hazy straw like orange. No light getting through this one. White tight bubbled head, beautiful lacing just like the rest of the tree houses. More bright orange than green and alter ego though. More orange juice appearance.
Citrus juice bomb soon as you crack the can. However, unlike alter ego and green, I'm getting more of a bitter hop resin with this one. More noticable malt in the nose as well. Don't get me wrong though, I'm still getting loads of fruit. Oranges, peaches, pineapples, tangerines. Just not as a pronounced fruit smell as the other two.
Taste is definitely not as tropical bomb foward as green or alter ego, definitely more citrusy and resinous. The hop resin sticks to your tongue for a while, and the bready malt has a nice bite. Very subtle oranges and lemon zest.
Still has the signature mouthfeel as the other two I've tried. Pretty creamy, medium bodied and dole-like juice character.
From only trying alter ego and green, I'd say this is my least favorite out the two. More of a traditional tasting IPA with hop resin, and bready malt as the main characteristics. Still slightly tropical, but nothing over the top with the fruitiness. Still a world class beer in its own right. 1,384 charactersMateo2699, Apr 12, 2016

4.25/5  rDev -8.4%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5thanks a lot to my brother for sharing this 2 Liter growler with me! I enjoyed this from a taster and willybecker.
The color is bright orange with thick haze and thick frothy white head with copious lace that sticks. The smell is very orange-like with citrus having a bright and fragrant aroma with mild herbal quality in a raw hop-type smell. The feel is very good with mostly hop resins with moderate carbonation and medium body with semi-low bitterness for the style with mild sweetness into the finish which is mostly dry.
The flavor is good with a intense amount of hop flavor with citrus flavors and slight tropical almost tangerine-like quality but not very acidic or bitter just juicy and lightly sweet in the middle without any definitive malt flavor just a balance to the mildly bitter herbal hop flavor which verges on grassy or vegetal as it finishes on the dry side. This is a highly drinkable Ipa -the hops really shine with low bitterness that makes it almost to easy to drink a large amount of. 1,012 charactersSlatetank, Apr 04, 2016

Pours a hazy OJ looking juice bomb beautfulness.  Thick head with sticky lacing.  Looks like a great NE IPA.
Smells like a juice bomb.  Notes of pineapple, citrus, and a hint of dank/hops. 
Tastes like it smells.  Amazing juice forward IPA with hints of hoppiness and fruits exploding in your mouth.
Feels unfiltered, a touch of grit, a great mouth feel for this beer style.
Overall I love this beer.  Is it worth the hype and how hard I worked to find it? Yes, it is.  Great looking can.  Amazing nose.  Great juice bomb taste.  I wish I could get more tree house beers. 664 charactersJay_P22, Mar 31, 2016

5/5  rDev +7.8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This is my first Tree House beer and I have to say it lives up to the hype. Incredibly hazy from the abundance of hops makes it as opaque as any quality stout. It smells like an orchard of citrus trees. Julius tastes just as it looks almost like orange juice. The flavor profiles for me come in three waves first with the hops up front, then a smooth as silk water, then a slight return of the hops at the end. Extremely complex yet balanced. Julius makes me want to move to Massachusetts. This is my favorite beer of all time. Cheers! 535 charactersTrevor11, Mar 31, 2016

Surprisingly dank aroma. Quite juicy, both citrus and tropical, but also pungently dank. A touch of pineapple, mango, and orange peel and pulp.
Quite sweet on the palate, with more emphasis on smooth tropical juices (mango again, with a hint of pineapple) than citrus. Still fairly dank and green. Smooth, sweet pale malt profile. Almost too sweet and smooth; no harshness, bite, or bitterness.
Smooth and extremely drinkable; full mouthfeel; creamy. Goes down way, way too easily. Fairly wet aftertaste, with hop oils lingering.
A touch more bitterness for balance would truly elevate this already excellent beer up another notch. 764 charactersRoguer, Mar 25, 2016

This one pours a brilliantly turbid bright orange, with a half inch head, and a good amount of lacing.
Smells like orange, passionfruit, and mango, just leaping out of the glass.
This is an absolute juice bomb, as I expected. There's basically no bitterness, and huge tastes of orange, pineapple, passionfruit, grapefruit, and some mango. It's unbelievably juicy.
This has a pretty thick and creamy mouthfeel, and goes down ultra easy. It's got a normal level of carbonation.
This is almost TOO juicy, I'd prefer a little more bitterness here, but I can't deny that it is delicious. 632 charactersGreesyFizeek, Mar 20, 2016

4.67/5  rDev +0.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Unfiltered pour. Thick orange color. Smells of passion fruit, mango, orange and citra hops. Super smooth on the palate, but a little too fruity for me. I'm not a huge fan of passion fruit or mango, and it's overpowering. Not necessarily a bad thing, unless you're not a huge fan of passion fruit/mango. I've read other reviews who claim it's not super juicy, and it most certainly is.
It's still head and shoulders above most other IPAs I've tasted, but it's not even Tree House's best IPA. That privilege goes to Alter Ego. 525 characterswepeeler, Mar 10, 2016

Appearance is a turbid, dark orange color with a two-finger white head that leaves huge lace.
Aroma is amazing, with mostly tropical and sweet citrus fruits - mango, papaya, pineapple, orange - and just a bit of dank and spice.
Taste is also very tropical, but with a little bit of melon and fresh mown grass, a tiny bit of pine and dank, and a very slight soft bitterness on the finish.
Mouth feel is just right.
Overall, an exceptionally juicy and hop forward beer 591 charactersFFreak, Mar 07, 2016

Look: The turbid look is in full effect. It is hard to see through but that orange juice look is something to behold. Putting this up to light just makes me want to chug the whole thing. I am definitely a fan. 
Smell: I don't think I have ever had a beer this dank. It is absolutely the best smelling IPA I have ever smelled. The tropical and citrus comes through to the highest degree. I could smell this beer all day.
Taste: It hits you in the face with the hop profile. I get strong mango and citrus (orange with a touch of lemon) with that hop pine in the aftertaste that is barely there. The malt is back focused meaning it is barely there but you can distinguish it towards the end. Again the hops are key in this and they nail it. Best hop profile in an IPA I have tasted. 
Feel: So I always like to compare IPAs/DIPAs to the best mouthfeel I ever had in an IPA. That beer is Heady Topper. It has that sticky hop profile I love, but combines with a great malt profile that just nails it. It lingers in your mouth. Julius has a similar profile. The hops have that dank, sticky profile but the malt is lacking a little bit. I wish it would coat your mouth and linger a little bit longer. I am not knocking this beer at all, I think it nails the feel well. The more I drink, the more I growing on this beer in this department. 
Overall: This beer has the best smell and hop profile I have ever had in an IPA. I feel the mouthfeel is lacking a little bit, but I really like this beer. It is a solid top 3 IPA/DIPA for me. I would buy a case and just drink it constantly. I am jealous of all of you who live in MA. Truly a great brewery and a fantastic IPA. 1,761 charactersNhens0016, Mar 06, 2016

It lived up to the hype: this is an excellent IPA. It pours an orangish color with a nice head on it. Nice nose. It’s fairly hoppy, with orange and tropical notes. The taste is also quite good. Lots of tropical and orange hoppy flavors. A faint sweetness from the malt body. Very smooth. A very nice beer. Edit: Have had the canned version now too.

Canned on 2/24 and enjoyed 2/27.
Poured from the 16 oz can into a snifter. Pours a beautiful thick hazy light tangerine color with one finger of head. Although the heads drops away, what remains has really nice lacing.
Aroma might be the most aromatic IPA I've ever encountered. Huge notes of tropical fruit, especially mango and pineapple.
Taste is delicious and complex with hops 90% of what I taste, little to no bitterness.
Mouthfeel was excellent.
Overall, this is my first Treehouse beer and it's the real deal. Certainly right there with the best of Hill Farmstead and Alchemist. Bravo! 642 charactersBoldRulerVT, Feb 28, 2016

I would believe that there is actual fruit juice in here and the mouth feel is complete like a glass of orange juice. At the edges of you tongue the mango drops off into a hint of bubble gum flavor. Best IPA I have ever had. 412 charactersBierRunner, Feb 27, 2016

L: Dark, burnt orange... completely opaque.  Glows a glorious orange with light shined behind it.  Gorgeous pure white head leaving sticky lacing.
S: The can does not lie… a tropical bouquet… not phony juicy juice but like a fresh, ripe peach and mango.  I’ve had peaches in Georgia that didn’t smell this good.  
T: Their twitter page does not lie… big and soft flavors… fruity and light and bright hops.
F: Very light with bright, prickly hops dancing on your tongue.  
O: Just staggering… I could drink all 6 of my allotment tonight.  Having come from Bub Light country in Southern Alabama for a contract in Milford, CT, the 3hr drive is well for it for a Wed. can run.  Tree House has exceeded the hype.  I almost can't believe that this beer will knock Westy 12 out of the top 10, but there is no better brewery to do it. 917 charactersjoezak5, Feb 25, 2016

Retention is excellent and there are massively thick sheets of lacing everywhere. The smell is a fruit juice bomb. Aromas of mango, pineapple, grapefruit and most notably orange burst out of the glass and engulf the senses. There is also a slight dankness. Taste is exactly the same. Feel is light side of medium and just so pillowy soft, juicy and drinkable. The dankness shows up on the back end, but there is barely any of the bitterness you would expect to go with it.

I've had plenty of Treehouse brews and actually never tried Julius until well after I've tried some of their others. For this batch, I'm not getting the crazy citrus that is described as in other reviews of Julius. Rather, I'm getting a dank, smooth hoppiness that is quite drinkable, and not bitter at all. Very delicious. 349 charactersHippoDude, Feb 25, 2016

4.85/5  rDev +4.5%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Pours a gravy-like, pale orange color. Develops a foamy 1/2 inch caps of suds, that sticks around for several minutes. I rated the appearance pretty high just because of what it is. Most IPAs would suffer with this appearance but being one of the new crops of NEIPAs, I think ti fits the part better than many. The aroma is very hop forward. To my nose, the overwhelming aroma is freshly peeled orange. But there are a lot of delicious fruity notes in addition. One might call them "tropical" but I can't put my finger on one specific fruit. Either way, this has very juicy and mouth watering aroma. The flavor is, well, orange juice. Well, more complex than orange juice really, but it is very reminiscent of the delicious breakfast beverage. It does have a nice citrus quality and an almost spicy character. There is a bitterness, but it pretty much drops off the palate immediately, mostly just serving to balance the overall fruity character of the beer.The mouthfeel is creamy and smooth. It has a lot more body than your typical West Coast IPA, though not "thick" by any means. Quite a unique mouthfeel for IPAs in general yet really bring home that "juicy" quality. Overall, just an awesome and fairly unique beer,  one I would drink on the reg, if possible. 1,265 charactersSoneast, Feb 21, 2016

4.27/5  rDev -8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25My first Tree House Brewery beer and review.  Very curious over the hype on this brewery and was lucky enough to score a can in Nashville, Tn!  Pint can dated 01-21-16 so not quite a month old.
L - Poured into Spiegelau IPA glass.  Full 2 finger off white head.  Opaque murky muddled orange.  Good carbonation.
S - Big citrus nose.  Not much else.
T - Very pleasant but not what I was expecting and unlike any IPA I've had.  It's pretty tasty but very minimal upfront hop profile.  Orange, peach, mango, followed with a slight bitter finish reminiscent of the white skin between the fruit and the peel of an orange or grapefruit.
F -  Nice full mouthfeel.  Very smooth.
After seeing Tree House beers quickly rise to the top of the ratings ranks, I assumed foul play (or at least the proud people of Monson, MA giving overly generous ratings to their local brewery).  After finally being able to sample some of the goods, my opinion has changed, but not by much.  I was hoping that this was one of those beers that makes you close your eyes and just melt away.  Maybe it is for some.  It just didn't do it for me.  Still a solid offering that deserves to be in the top 250 for now.
I hope this review, at the very least, eases the curiosity of the out-of-towners that may not get to sample this anytime soon.  Don't offer up any of your cellared  treasures in trade. 1,371 charactersNatoMasochism, Feb 20, 2016

Most of the aspects of this beer have already been well covered below. A few thoughts: Don't be in a hurry with this one - some of the more subtle fruit flavors like peach come out as it warms up a bit. Perhaps what I like most is the balance between citrus/fruit flavors and the hoppy bitterness --nicely proportioned. If I had to choose only one beer for the rest of my life, this would be it (although still need to try Tree House's King Julius and Juice Machine). 578 characters11-52_4hops, Feb 16, 2016

4.43/5  rDev -4.5%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Had a sample of this on line over at Other Half back in the middle of the winter on a freezing day and finally got around to having a full can of this tonight. Traded for it in New York and yes, this was a bit old with a date of 4/12 on the bottom of the can. Thankfully, this aged well and still tasted fresh as there wasn't anything dank, skunked, or wretched to this with the added bonus of no floaties when I held this up to the light. Already ahead of the game before I took a sip!
The pour was to as to be expected as the beer had a dank hue to it with a dark goldenrod appearance with some light seeping in around the edges. Lots of foam to the head that took a while to settle down but surprisingly, there wasn't a lot of lacing left on my pint glass aside from a few rings at the top. Tons of mango and citrus in the nose as the passion fruit and vanilla creme came in during my first few sips of this. Possibly the smoothest beer I've ever tasted as the liquid went down before I even had a chance to fully savor it. Low carbonation and lots of melon rind in the aftertaste ensured that this would go down easily as it had a slickness to it that few beers could match, though there wasn't any oil or resin to be found here. The mouthfeel gave me the impression that this was a Hefeweizen and had wheat to it, which was a testament to how balanced, full, and easygoing this was for an IPA!
The booze was here but good luck being able to pick it out in the midst of all of the tropical and citrus flavors that accompanied the wonderful, subtle dankness that this characterized this trademark beer. So easy to see why this is Tree House's flagship brew, anyone wondering how the northeast and New England brews caught up to their West Coast counterparts need to seek this out. There's plenty of reasons why this has such a lofty rating! 1,845 charactersJerzDevl2000, Feb 13, 2016

Opaque with haze, but no floating particulate.  Medium white head.
Orange and citrus nose, sweetish without leaning super tropical.
Again got orange and grapefruit, not much of the sweeter mango notes.
Medium bodied IPA.
Overall and excellent beer, I think it suffered a bit from me having a Doppelganger from a growler just before.  The Doppelganger was much more aromatic. 393 charactersZonk, Feb 08, 2016

I actually like this style of IPA.  Love the hazy, unfiltered, low carb, mega dry-hopped IPA... but for some reason I was very put off by the "old" malt tasting....  flavor...  of this beer.   It tasted like an IPA that has been sitting around for about 2 months.  
It lacked flavor and very muted nose as well.   Date on the can was 1-21-2016 (so about... 11 days old)
This isn't a bad beer at all, but to call it world class?   In my books - no. 494 characterssukwonee, Feb 03, 2016

Poured a dark, sickly orange color that reminded me off extra pulp orange juice gone bad.  The gf actually said "that looks f*****g disgusting" when I poured it.  The aroma is pretty good, lots of fruit there.  Taste was again citrus, lots of orange for me, not the hop profile I enjoy in my beers.  No way did this come close to living up to the hype or its #10 ranking.  Put this on a shelf in my store and I would walk past it everyday, just not my cup of tea.
Had to edit because the first rating was way to high for me personally.  Gave in to the hype and didn't want to rate it poorly, but honestly, there was nothing good about this beer except the smell for me. 714 charactersSDDLSK, Jan 28, 2016

Pours hazy with generous foam that slowly dissipates into fine skim. Obviously, orange citrus is the primary flavor, but it's tempered by dank, resinous hop profile. Very crisp with enough malt backbone to remind you it's not juice, just juicy. Mid-level abv means you can have a couple, if you can find them. About as good as it gets. 427 charactersbeerwolf72, Jan 23, 2016

4.99/5  rDev +7.5%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5God damn.  I've had Julius on roughly 10 different occasions to this point and it has never tasted as good as this one tastes right now.  It's roughly 3 weeks old, canned on new year's eve, and it's damn near transcendent.  Definitely one of if not THE best IPA I've ever had.  As soon as you start pouring, the aroma hits you like a ton of bricks: orange, pineapple, mango, fruity as fuck, with a little bit of bubble gum too.  Taste starts with that yeasty bubble gum, like juicy fruit, follows mid-palate with the aforementioned fruits, and finishes with a soft bitterness - more of a dryness really.  This thing is a straight up juice bomb, but it never crosses into that slightly too-sweet territory that I feel like the Grimm IPAs frequently do:  that bitter finish keeps it from tasting too much like Orangina, which is a good thing.  The bubble gum thing is a bit odd - adds kind of a hefeweizen feel - but it's not off-putting at all, and kind of acts as a Tree House calling card.  Overall this beer is just flat-out delicious.  The hype is absolutely justified. 1,072 charactersNickwierda, Jan 20, 2016

4.34/5  rDev -6.5%look: 3 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Poured into a Teku snifter glass with a solid two fingers of head from a can dated just shy of 30 days.  Color is a turbid dark orange reminiscent of oxidized pineapple juice.  Aroma is like burying your nose in hop pellets—intense.  Contrary to the noted citrus, I'm getting more pine and resin with hints of candied orange peel and ripe honeydew.  Taste is lush and full bodied, but the hop presence remains front and center.  Flavor notes of clementine, and citrus juice, but that pithy hop presence is consistent and astringent, even against the backdrop of malt.  Overall, I've had this twice from the same batch and felt the hop presence on this one backed off from the stronger citrus hop notes from a can two weeks fresher.
Final thoughts: I frankly have no idea what the Alstrom Bros loved about this hazy, unfiltered IPA, but hated about Bissell Brothers' The Substance IPA, another hazy New England IPA.  These two, in my mind, are very similarly styled, but whereas Julius was praised, The Substance was stated by the Bros to be "a bit of a mess".  All reviews are a matter of opinion—that just caught my eye as I had the two nearly back to back and both were terrific and certainly not 18 points different on a 100 rating scale. 1,246 charactersmichaelpearson, Jan 19, 2016

4.34/5  rDev -6.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.25Going to start this off by saying I was slightly underwhelmed with all the hype behind Julius and Green, by no means were these bad beers they just have been overhyped and like most things the hype is usually greater than the final product. First off the nose of this was an absolute citrus bomb, tons of orange, grapefruit, orange pith, just citrus fruit. I dont know who had to sell their soul to the devil because I dont understand how treehouse makes their beers have a mouth feel this good. Taste similarly follows the nose but not as juice bomb as I have experienced with some of treehouse or trilliums other beers. Good malt bill but not as much hop bite as I would like. Outstanding beer but I do believe its overhyped. 727 charactersvicinandp, Jan 12, 2016

Looks like light orange juice, smell and taste are a juicy hop balance.  Tried this alongside King Julius and actually prefer this one, as the lower alcohol taste makes this much more drinkable.  With juicy IPAs and coffee/maple stouts, maybe beer is trying to take over breakfast now? 350 charactersIowaBiertrinker, Jan 11, 2016

Hazy with a foamy/slightly creamy head.
Grapefruit/citrus/tropical fruit aroma.
Taste is similar.  Smoooooth and fruity.
Really great mouthfeel.
I find myself taking huge sips because its so drinkable.
Getting papaya now as its warming up a little.
Mango.

Yes this beer is hoppy, but not in the bitter sense, in the sweet peach flavor that its specific hops deliver.  This super smooth brew is that way because of how outrageously juicy it is... medium feel and very soft bubbles make this a completely amazing IPA. 297 charactersPourharddrinkslow, Jan 08, 2016

Two words: Orange Creamsicle
The mouthfeel and taste stand out most from this beer. Strong notes of orange with a creamy mouthfeel was uniquely particularly for an American IPA. Super smooth and very drinkable, does not rock the palate but something enjoyable for a cool summer day. 382 charactersbol3by, Jan 08, 2016
4.48/5  rDev -3.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5A- Just like Alter Ego, this IPA pours a stunningly bright orange in color and extremely hazy in the glass. Again, it basically just looks like orange juice in the glass. A big and dense head of about 3 fingers thickness forms and never goes away, leaving a solid wall of lace down the glass.
S- Tropical citrus fruits and bursting, juicy orange hit the nostrils when you take a whiff of this beer. I would almost say that the scent lacks hops bitterness, but it is just masked by the juiciness of the same hops. Juicy notes preside throughout the beginning and middle of the scent, barely relenting until the very end. The back end of the smell shows a bit of the more traditional IPA bitterness, and it lingers just a bit after the sniff.
T- When the beer hits the tongue, there is just a brief instant of hops bitterness in the flavor before the orange and other fruit flavors move in. A touch of orange, tangerine, and mango lightly dance across the tongue with some mild hop bitterness in the background. The back half of the drink sees the orange flavor fade a bit with a slight ramp up of mild hops bitterness. The lingering flavor on the tongue ends up being a smoothie of citrus and mild hop bite.
M- Incredibly drinkable and fairly light on the palate, this beer is very thirst quenching and an easy drink. Neither the hops or alcohol creep up on you in this one. The drink itself is very smooth and the carbonation level is just right for the style.
Overall, this was a very pleasant drinking experience. The nice and subtle orange and citrus flavors, both in the scent and taste, make this beer somewhat unique and pretty delicious. 1,648 charactersboilermakerbrew, Jan 08, 2016

4.94/5  rDev +6.5%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.7516 oz can poured into Teku glass. Canned 1/6/16 and consumed 1/6/16.
Look: Opaque orange; a bit darker than orange juice. Half to a full finger of off-white head. Dissipated fairly quick leaving behind significant and almost immediate lacing on the glass.
Smell: Mango, papaya, peach, citrus, bit of pine. Absolutely intoxicating aroma
Taste: Tropical and citrus flavors. Orange, mango, guava. Hops still cut through nicely. Finishes a pleasant bitter, with a surprising amount of heat. 6.8%'s nothing to scoff at, but I feel it more here than most beers in this ABV range.
Feel: Moderate carbonation and quite crisp, very pleasant. However, I cannot praise enough the lingering mouthfeel left behind. Creamy and velvety and very decadent. Unparalleled.
Overall: My first Julius and Tree House Brewing experience delivered on all levels. An unforgettable experience from start to finish. I also picked up Green which I am looking forward to enjoying and reviewing. 969 charactersPCole, Jan 07, 2016

Pours an orangey (completely hazed over) hued, can was acquired fresh from the brewery and was in the beer fridge for 10 days. This hazed look is not to be compared with "milkshake" beers IMO though fresh from the brewery or cans that are decanted all of the way will make it look even more hazed. A lot of the haze is chillhaze though who wants to drinking this beer warm?  Head retention is great. Fresh juicy orange zest & tropical fruit nose, the aroma is nothing short of epic. Smooth and very crisp, lush semi-creamy medium body. Hop bitterness is a piney, hop flavor is juicy an all with suggestions of guava, ripe honeydew, dragonfruit, & cumquats. 
Way too much fun quaffing this back ... everyone should hunt this beer down. 772 charactersJason, Jan 04, 2016

Smell - So many fruits: orange, mango, grapefruit.
Taste - not sure if this will make any sense but this is creamy AND juicy. Also, it's bold yet balanced. Obviously the orange stands out, but the are also some other bold fruit flavors but nothing overpowering.
Moth Feel - wow, exceptional! Perfect for this beer, nice and thick but not overdone. 
Overall this is simply one of my favorites. It's a tasty IPA that's not overly bitter. Fruity, yet not sweet at all. Tree House is an amazing brewery and this is their most popular one... and for good reason. 631 charactersBillErickson, Dec 27, 2015

4.99/5  rDev +7.5%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5To start off, I want to say this beer is in my top 3 beers of all time. Im pouring a fresh can into a HF tulip glass, the head is off white creamy and settles down to a very rich lacing. The nose is just pure tropical juice and bright fresh hops. I smell more of an orange/tangerine than the typical grapefruit. The color is an unfiltered hazy opaque orange. The taste is definite tropical fruit with some pine coming through. I can tell there is a massive amount of hops in the whirlpool and dry hop bill. Being unfiltered the mouthfeel is just awesome. Really creamy and has a rich feel as it goes to the back of the palate. As soon as I swallow a sip I have to have another one. Overall, this is a beer which is a must have for anyone who proclaims themselves a hop head! Hands down one of the best Ive ever had. That's a big statement. 839 characterspeepmachine, Dec 25, 2015

4.3/5  rDev -7.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.2516 oz can, packaged on 10/27/15. "Live wild" on the bottom of the can.
Pale amber and cloudy, almost murky, with a big, creamy, persistent white head.  Good lacing on the glass too.  The aroma is heavy on the hops, but you knew that already.  Citrus, orange, grapefruit, tropical fruit, and peach come to mind.  Faint grainy malts in the background, but make no mistake, this is all about showcasing the hops.  Long lasting, juicy hop flavor that makes for a bitter finish.  That being said, it's smooth on the palate.  Medium-full bodied and chewy, with a bit of warmth as it goes down.
This beer is bright and fruity, to say the least.  Probably better suited for the summertime, as opposed to a cool winter night.  I prefer hoppy beers to be a little cleaner than the new breed of cloudy IPAs that are being produced, however a massively fruity IPA such as this is a rare treat to indulge in.  Thank you, Ian, for not one, but two cans of this excellent brew! 964 charactersJacobob10, Dec 23, 2015

4.66/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75I hadn't been to Tree House since they stopping by their original location a few times a few years back, until I had a chance to stop by while in western Mass today. I picked up some cans of Julius, canned today, and opened one right when I got home--doesn't get much fresher than that.
L: hazy golden-orange, the color of the can. I don't mind haziness in my IPAs, and this is one of the hazier ones I've seen, but without any murkiness.
S: Not as strong as I expected, but very nice--mango, melon, citrus, lots of fruit, only the slightest glancing hint of alcohol once it warms. Not getting much in the way of breadiness or any other characteristic malty attributes.
T: Wow. They weren't kidding: mango, passionfruit, papaya, tangerine--tropical fruit abounds. There's a bit more of a biscuity background here than in the smell, but it's still very faint. This is easily one of--if not the--juiciest IPAs I've ever had, an extremely drinkable one at that. Very little piney or grassy notes, and almost no bitterness really. This puts to shame all the grapefruit-added IPAs that seem to be all over the place these days.
F: Surprisingly creamy, with very little bite or bitterness; medium-bodied, almost silky; and very soft carbonation.
O: Lovely. As my wife said, "This may be my new favorite beer." 1,308 charactersFrankLloydMike, Dec 22, 2015

Taste was all tropical citrus flavors and finished so smooth like drinking a carbonated tropical juice drink.  Only negative was the lack of bitter bite, otherwise a great great beer.

4.72/5  rDev +1.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.75A massive thanks to Pearpicker for this generous gift. I don't ever drink canned beers nor do I like them, but when someone's gives you a Julius, you can't ignore that. So here goes my first canned review...
Poured at 45°F from a can (I couldn't make out the smeared date on the bottom) into a Spiegelau IPA glass Consumed on 14Dec15.
LOOK: Pours with 3 fingers worth of dense, white foam that begins transforming beautifully as the time passes. After 1 minute, the foam becomes very rocky and spacious. After 1 minute and 20 seconds, dissipation begins to kick in leaving behind extremely thick lacing. At 3 and a half minutes, the half fingers worth of foam that is left has returned to its condensed state. Orange in color with an extreme amount of cloudiness. The rising bubbles that can be seen are at the base of the glass where it is slightly less cloudy than the rest of the beer, are both small and very small in size and subtle in quantity. Lacing is very thick in and high in quantity.
SMELL: Strong aromas of peaches, mangos, guava, ans papaya balance beautifully with mild aromas of piney hops, oranges, grapefruits, tangerines, and sweet bready malts. A hint of bitter hop aromas can also be detected, but they further add balance to this gorgeous aroma.
TASTE: Strong peach, mango, guava, and papaya flavors enter initially as very strong orange, grapefruit, and tangerine flavors immediately follow. There is a slight tartness to the citrus flavors that I have not encountered before with other IPAs. It is very pleasant. Mild piney hop flavors and subtle sweet bready malt flavors enter the palate next as peach, mango, guava, and papaya flavors grow slightly stronger. Subtle bitter hop flavors make their debut and quickly grow to mild as all previous flavors persist in strength. 
FEEL: This is somewhere between light-bodied and medium-bodied. Carbonation is subtle. Goes down creamy and incredibly smooth. Finishes with a mild dryness.
NOTE: I can't believe I'm saying this, but I have finally found an IPA better than Yellow Rose. The fruit flavors dominated and I loved it. What really got me was the tartness from the citrus flavors. It reminded me of drinking a nice glass of orange juice. 2,217 charactersMyotus, Dec 14, 2015

Smell is piney resin, citrus - orange, grapefruit, and lemon, and some malty sweetness.
Taste is citrus and hoppy.  Pineapple, mango, and orange come out as it warms.  Malt sweetness is also present.
Mouthful is medium with medium carbonation, smooth. Finish is dry and lingering.
Overall I am surprised at how nice of an IPA this is.  The flavors are bright and not overwhelming.  The balance is there along with the drink ability.  Very pleasurable.  Seek out. 599 charactersSlack, Dec 13, 2015

Although I prefer Tree House Green over Julius, they're both world-class IPA's. What Tree House is doing is very, very special right now in the craft beer community. Big, soft flavors. Every beer is so delicious.
Pours a very hazy, bright orange color. Beautiful in a glass. Smells very potent of oranges, tangerines, orange creamsicle, orange cream soda, etc. Is this even beer?!
Wow. So flavorful on the pallet. Bright, tropical fruit and tangerine with the taste. Mild to medium bitterness on the back end. So smooth, so drinkable, so crushable. Medium sweetness (but with a high hop/low malt profile, which I prefer in an IPA). A bit of mango flavors come out as the beer warms up. Really something special.
Mouthfeel is near perfect. Thick, creamy mouthfeel. That of a stout, almost. Really makes this beer all that much more special.
I prefer the flavor profile of Tree House Green a bit more, but to me, this beer is near perfect.

Look: It looks like orange cream soda. The froth looks creamy and color was as orange as the can with haziness. This maybe the most unique looking IPA. Hard to believe this color comes naturally.
Smell: Tons of tropical and citrus. Smell is like no other beer.
Taste: A lot like the smell. Mangoes and papayas with some oranges. Finishes sweet.
Feel: Perfect carbonation, and small bite of bitterness at the end.

After pouring into nice pint glass the aroma comes at me from far away - frankly reminds me of the first Heady I cracked. Great fuity nose. It smells "sweet" if that is possible. Orange/tangerine.
Mouthfeel is sooth, perfect carbonation for an IPA.
Taste: First hit is fruity, orange, orange zest (nit pithy at all!). Beautifully integrated, smooth. Nice long finish with a bit of bitterness. Mango comes through on my 4th sip.
Immensely enjoyable. I've had Heady, SOS, Nelson, Pliney, Zombie and lots of other big money DIPA/IPA's. This one feels very different and right there with any of them. Fantastic beer. 672 charactersKATCanada, Dec 10, 2015

4.12/5  rDev -11.2%look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Many thanks to Kegatron for the share on this pounder can. Heard lots of good things and was excited to try this freshy last month. It appears a chalky orange color with white head that fades leaving stringy lace.
It smells of orange juice and slight herb garden feel to counter the fruity hop qualities. This tastes pithy and pulpy with zesty rinds reminescent of orange juice with herbal aspect and a cooling menthol sort of thing in the aftertaste.
This is a medium bodied brew with modest carbonation. Pretty nice stuff but I dont understand the craze and justification to line up for hours just to pay a hefty price for a couple cans. Regardles im super appreciative to get to try this. 693 charactersstakem, Dec 03, 2015

4.3/5  rDev -7.3%look: 5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.516oz. can poured into 16oz. CLBC/Jameson snifter
Look - almost opaque orange with half a finger of bright white head that fizzles into a foam collar. Spotty lacing. Looks raw, rustic, and untamed. What NE/VT-style IPA should look like.
Smell - sweet citrus rind, cut grass, and pine. I've gotta dig for it, but it's an appropriate bouquet.
Taste - Orange orange orange! Nice hit of bitter to start, mellowing into bright, sweet orange rind and pine. Definitely not the most intense flavor hit I've had on an IPA, but still quite good. Gonna be belching orange peel all night.
Feel - I get that soft carbonation is their thing but I so wish this was fizzier. Mouthfeel is thick, velvety, and smooth nonetheless.
Overall - Perhaps I had spent too much time riding the hype train for this one, but it was actually a tad below my expectations. Don't get me wrong; I thoroughly enjoyed it, don't regret buying it at all, and would gladly buy it again if I were in the area and had an hour to kill waiting in line, but I went in expecting to be bludgeoned with oranges and got something much more well-rounded instead. Still recommend it if you can get it. 1,155 charactersDannyS, Nov 29, 2015

A: The beer is a deep cloudy gold color, with a large foamy off-white head that fades very slowly and leaves a thick lace on the glass.
S: The aroma is an excellent blend of piney hops, fruity citrus and caramelized malts.
T: The taste starts out sweet with a strong citrus flavor along with notes of caramel. Then a strong but not over-powering floral hops bitterness comes in. The hops bitterness is comparatively weak at first but it strengthens as you continue to drink the beer. The malt character is heart and brings an excellent balance. The after-taste is slightly sweet and slightly hoppy.
M: Very crisp and very smooth, medium body, medium carbonation, finish is quite clean for the style.
O: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not too filling, good kick, very good representation of style, this is an excellent IPA to drink for a long time. 961 charactersTheManiacalOne, Nov 29, 2015

Pouring a hazy orange with a dense dirty white head with very good retention and lacing, this looks great. The nose is a giant blend of tropical fruit with mango, papaya, passionfruit , cooked oranges, fleshy, pulpy and delicious. Doughy malt is present. The palate opens with a riot of hop flavor, just tons and tons of fruit. Mango, peach, papaya, baked oranges galore with a definite doughy malt character, a little bit like cereal? Not unlike other New England IPAs I've has on this trip east, it's a little messy, lacking in the clean bitterness that ties together all the hop flavors. What bitterness is present is a little minty/ spruce like, interesting but a touch unfocused. Medium in body with a beautiful creamy carbonation, this beer had a long finish, mostly fruity with a little bitterness on the finish. Interestingly, the bitterness does also have a mild astringency, mildly aspirin like. Solid. I'd drink a ton if I could. 976 charactersDefenCorps, Nov 27, 2015

Really amazing beer.  
This is a nice looking, nice smelling, great tasting/feeling IPA that will make you wonder how so much fruit flavor can come from little green buds on a vine.  It pours pretty nice out of an attractive can.  The immediate punch of hops hits you upon opening the can.  The aroma is subtle but layered with lots of tropical fruit and some earthy green backbone.  The flavor, though, is incredible.  Sweet and thick, creamy and soft there is tons of mango, some mandarin, overripe melon, pungent pine/herbs/marijuana.  The whole thing drinks like a milkshake and makes you want to just slam it.  
What I find impressive here is the balance.  Every feature seems to be cranked to 11, but I don't think anything really steals the show or overshadows the rest (although there is a wave of mango and dank, bitter "pungentnessness" at the end of each swallow.).  Every sip brings a wave of experience and each time I thought it would overwhelm.  All it does is make you want more.  I could seriously chug the can (and I'm no Bluto--Animal House, not Popeye).  
I would absolutely have this one again.  Worth searching for until you find it.  
Made me audibly groan upon smelling/tasting it.  (4.5) 1,794 charactersTheDoctor, Nov 21, 2015

Look: A murky burnt orange hue. 1/2 inch head that dissipates. Lacing on the glass. 
Smell: Dank citrus with a little pine. Certainly lives up to the name with a lot of orange juice and orange zest/rind on the nose. Tropical fruits as well. 
Taste: Citrus, mostly orange, bready malts with lightly lingering bitterness. I liken it to biting into an orange -- skin and all. Bitter, juicy, delicious. 
Feel: Mellow carbonation creates an almost creamy mouthfeel. Coats your palate sip after sip with a light bitterness. 
Overall: I'm spoiled, because this is truly a world-class IPA that is pretty easy to get a hold of if you live in MA like I do. Stands up to most of the big dogs in its style. Always a treat. 771 charactersMCurtin, Nov 21, 2015

Children of the 80s like myself will harken back to the flavor of Orange Julius when trying this beer. In short, it is god damn amazing. 
Beautiful, luscious and thick haze. Prominent and resilient frothy white head. Massive citrus aroma on the nose, orange/tangerine in particular. Crisp mouthfeel, no alcohol bite whatsoever, and that amazing creaminess that Tree House just crushes every time. I don't know if it's their water treatment or what but it's just wonderfully soft while delivering all those big juicy hop flavors. 
There aren't any negatives I can offer on any of the Tree House beers I've tried. Honestly they don't just make consistently good beer, they make consistently world class knock your socks into next week beer. The only downside even remotely worth mentioning is you need to drink their hoppy stuff quickly as the freshness is so off the charts that waiting a few weeks will cause a noticeable drop in flavor punch. 1,055 charactersdd43, Nov 20, 2015

Pours a fluffy, 2.5 finger powder white head with great retention. Beer is a cloudy and pulpy orange. Lacing is stringy with great cling. Fantastic everywhere except the color.
Nose is citrus, starfruit and cane sugar. Tropical fruit notes of papaya, starfruit pine and grass throughout. Aromatic. Delicious!
Opens sweet citrus, pine and cane sugar. Bready with a smooth malt body in the middle. Biscuity throughout in a way I haven't tasted before. More citrus, pineapple, starfruit and papaya towards the middle and end. Tropical fruit on the finish. Outstanding! 
Light bodied with moderate to low carbonation. Smooth and quenching in the mouth and goes down soft and watery. Dry finish with a sticky, dry aftertaste. Super drinkable. Carbonation and feel are just right. 
This one certainly lives up to the hype. Although I'm not a fan of unfiltered-looking beers, everything else about this beer is top notch. Definitely worth trying. 1,017 charactersSpeedwayJim, Nov 15, 2015

4.47/5  rDev -3.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a murky dark orange. It doesn't get by on its looks, but it does have nice fluffy off white head. Faint aroma of melon. Definitely get a lot of melon, honey, and honey dew in the taste. A little bit of papaya and bitterness on the finish. Flavor is a bit underwhelming and lacks some of the juicy intensity that I enjoy, but it has a very nice soft mouthfeel. Overall, I like Julius, but it's far from the best IPA I've had and it's definitely not the best beer I've had from Tree House.
UPDATE: I am getting more citrus and a touch of bitterness. However, there's still some jello like sweetness from the combination of malt and mouthfeel that's kind of off putting.
UPDATE 2: I've come around on the mouthfeel. It's super gummy and chewy. I find myself craving the TH mouthfeel at times more than their flavors.
Update 3: Much more passionfruit this time around. Both in aroma and flavor. A little bit of pineapple too. Best this beer has tasted for me. 964 charactersSheppard, Nov 12, 2015

3.92/5  rDev -15.5%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4Alright. The IPA at the top of the heap for the moment. So stoked to be able to try this. After several cans, I think I'm ready to sketch some thoughts.
Rather than go through the parts, I'll start with the sum: Julius is fruity as hell. But, to my palate, there's just not enough depth of hop flavor, nor balancing bitterness. It suffers under the weight of its richly decadent body, fruity esters combining with sweet malt to make this more like sweetened hop cake than bracing, refreshing IPA. I say all this with some reserve. Julius is not a bad beer in the least. And my guess is that this is exactly the sort of beer the brewers set out to create, so mission accomplished there. For me, though, it just doesn't work as well as so many other beloved IPAs.
Now, as to the parts themselves, Julius is a deep, dark orange in the glass, darn near opaque. Under artificial lighting, it's not especially attractive. It has a nice foamy head to start, though retention isn't great (unlike its intrastate rivals, Trillium, whose brews tend to have head for days). The nose is the strong suit, at least at the start, offering a nice blast of peachy fruitiness, with perhaps some citric notes thrown in too. Unfortunately, once all those dry hop volatiles evaporate, J. gets a bit oversaturatedly fruity and, rather surprisingly, malt forward. Palate is heavy, dense even, and drinkability is not especially high. There's some backing bitterness in there, but it's restrained, letting the fruity esters and hops dominate. In the end, Julius is befitting of its name, reminding me of some tropical-flavored iteration of an Orange Julius, thick, fruity, rich. 
So cool to try this brew, which in some ways typifies the NEIPA. For me, I'd gladly sacrifice some of that oversaturated fruitiness for more drinkability and more depth/acuity of flavor. But, for those in the mood for some fruity hop excess, this'll do the trick. 1,921 charactersbreadwinner, Nov 12, 2015
4.85/5  rDev +4.5%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Canned 11/4/15. A week old.
A: Pours a cloudy orange. Big tall...orange head? It's kinda tan-orange I swear.  Great head retention. Fairly limited lacing. 
S: Tropical fruit/citrus bomb. Oranges, pineapples, papaya, mango, everything. Very bold, very inviting. Smells like a nice juice blend, you'd never expect this to be beer.
T: More of the same. Big orange juice presence with lots of pineapple and mango to back it up. Huge hop flavors but almost no bitterness up front. Decent caramel sweetness in the middle. Light wave of drying bitterness in the finish gives balance to the initial sweet, fruity flavors. Lingering oranges (peel and all), light grapefruit and great mango flavor. 
M: Medium bodied, soft and smooth. Extremely drinkable. 
O: Geez. Amazing fruitiness, on par with drinking actual fresh fruit juice. Great citrus and tropical flavors. Surprisingly low bitterness, just enough to balance it out on the back end. Combining this with the soft, smooth mouthfeel puts the drinkability at about a 37 out of 10. Stunningly good beer. Easily the best IPA I've ever had. Heady is the only thing that I've had that is close but that's a different style altogether. Just incredible and a must-try for anyone who even pretends to like IPAs. 1,256 charactersDope, Nov 12, 2015

5/5  rDev +7.8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This is the perfect IPA in my view. It takes a couple of cans to truly appreciate this brew because I initially thought it didn't live up to the hype after the first can/sip. And this is partly due to its complexity. I love the fruit in this but what separates this beer from the rest is the herbal character. You almost feel healthy drinking this. Go drink this before Tree House expands further and, God forbid, something changes about this beer (knock on wood). 464 charactersallezvousen, Nov 07, 2015

4.67/5  rDev +0.6%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Poured from a week old can into a teku:
Appearance: thick, turbid orange color, with a pillowy white head. Pretty much looks exactly like orange juice, with a nice fluffy white head on top. 
Aroma: the second you open the can, tropical aroma pours out. Loads of refined citrus aroma, with oranges, grapefruit, and tons of mango. Not much malt evident at all, it's all hops here!
Taste: Silky smooth and pungent tropical flavor. Layer upon layer upon layer of smoothie fruits, with mango first, followed by the more citrusy grapefruit and orange, and finishing with a little bit of rind/pith on the finish. Delicious and refreshing.
Feel: soft to medium body, with the perfect amount of carbonation. Not overly crisp, and not just juice either. Elevates the beer, no doubt.
Overall: it's one of the best IPAs on the planet. Seek it out and bury yourself in its layers of hops. 880 charactersTheElectricOne, Nov 03, 2015

Hoppy, citrusy and smooth; I ended up finishing the can (via pint glass) much faster than I expected as it is really smooth and drinkable. I think I like this more than the other TH beers I've tried, though I've loved them all. They really cater to my palate, I need to visit that place... a growler filled with Julius... a short drive to Maple Hill disc golf, that'd be a perfect Saturday.
This sits with Substance as a favorite (single) IPA. Excellent brew! 572 charactersPip_Count_167, Nov 02, 2015

4.97/5  rDev +7.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I have enjoyed many of the hyped up IPA and DIPA.  This beer is the bomb!  Massive amounts of tropical fruit in the nose and taste (from Citra hops I suspect).  Peach, Mango, and grapefruit juicy dankness are the flavors that bust through.  Smooth, creamy feel to accompany this, but does finish a bit less hoppy than what I would like.  I drank first out of the can, but if you pour, deep orange  hazy color.  IMO, one of the best IPA's that I have ever had.  The only thing I would say would make it better would be a little more ABV (its at 6.8, but a nice 8 like Sip of Sunshine would rule),  Regardless, top notch for the style and I could drink this for the rest of my life.   Cheers!! 691 charactersdahlen22, Oct 29, 2015

A: pours a funky orange color, like murky Tang almost. Decent 1/2" of head and nice sticky lacing. 
S: one of the most interesting smelling IPA's I've ever smelled. Lots of fruit, specifically citrus and mango and it is bursting out of the glass. As soon as I popped the can the aroma was evident.
T: not as impressive as the smell. The fruitiness is present but quickly fades and leaves just a slight dry bitterness.
M: mouthfeel was just above average. Carbonation was appropriate but nothing out of the ordinary. 
O: glad I got to try it, have another can to do a side by side with Alter Ego. Nowhere near the best IPA out there, not even in the top ten for my tastes. Would drink again if given to me but not gonna try and trade as its value is way over inflated.. 847 charactersDocrock, Oct 24, 2015

Pours cloudy with an orange and peach-colored body. Looks a bit murky. Fizzy white head that turns into a beehive-like wax. 3.5
Bursting with tropical aroma. Tons of pineapple and mango and dank, resinous aroma. That fruit aroma is insane. 4.5
A step below the aroma. The tropical fruit recedes a bit. Still get a nice blend of pineapple and mango and passionfruit but it lacks the pop the nose suggested. There's some earthy and resinous flavor there that reminds me of a fresh hop beer. Floral and bubblegum on the finish. 4.25
Drinks light and lovely. Very smooth and easy to drink. Light bitterness and a resinous, sticky feel. 4.25 681 charactersONovoMexicano, Oct 19, 2015

Sunset hazy yellowish orange, nice frothy head and very excellent lacing in my Rodenbach Grand Cru Tulip.
Wow.. Tons or orange and tangerine. Peachy mango. The story here is primarily the orange julius flavor as if there were a wee bit of cream in there. Pretty amazing really how well this fits the name of the beer. Taste is all the same. just a wee bit of pine in the finish, keeping it creamy, yet dry on the back end.
Mouthfeel. Well, as a lover of the finer west coast IPAs, I now finally get what these east coasters are talking about with these new school softer IPAs.  Translation: All the hop flavor without the crazy high IBU hop bitterness that follows. Nice and delicate soft pillowy mouthfeel. Unlike any I can remember having. 
This is my first experience with this brewery. I also have an equally fresh Lights On I will dive into later this week which I can't wait to get into. The Hype is real Guys....the hype is real. 1,027 charactersRBassSFHOPit2ME, Oct 18, 2015
4.6/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured into a Dogfish traditional oversized snifter.  Bottom of can says 10 06 15.
A- Pours a murky orangeish amber color with a 1/2 inch off-white head that retains decently before becoming a thick ring around the edge of the glass and random splotches of bubbly surface foam.  Resilient lacing leaves a broken ring behind.
S- Somewhat bright juicy aroma brings to mind orange juice, pineapple juice and peach with a slightly dank quality overlying.
T- More tropical fruit juiciness with a solid resinous hop bitterness that work so very well together.  I keep coming back for more and more sips, it's so drinkable.  Slightly sweet.  Really good hop burps.
M- Dry and a bit sharp from the hops.  Medium carbonation and a body leaning toward the lighter side.
O- The thing that sells this as a superior IPA is the flavor-intensity-to-drinkability ratio.  Yes, I've had IPAs that are more dank and in-your-face delicious, but the way this beer accomplishes that juicy, refreshing, vibrant hop character while also being so smooth and somewhat sessionable...this is where it's at. 1,083 charactersImmortale25, Oct 18, 2015

Amazing citrus aroma, clean hoppy taste, perfect amount of bitterness and a ridiculously smooth and creamy body. Granted, this comes from a can literally off the line yesterday so it's unreal fresh. The aroma and taste are very assertive but it's the smoothness and ease of drinking that sets it apart from all other IPAs. Hits the sweet spot of being dank, tropical, almost juicy in its fruit flavor, with the lightest kiss of malt to prevent the taste from being sticky. Drinks and finishes so crisp without a resiny or bitter aftertaste that when you're done with a sip, you're done; the beer doesn't overwhelm the palette. Balance is its greatest virtue. World class. 708 charactersManapuaMan, Oct 12, 2015

Taste is is too bitter for my taste, with the good elements of the smell falling a bit to the wayside in favor of intense bitterness and a bit of caramel sweetness. 
It's a good beer, but the bitterness is overdone and the flavor is disappointing in comparison to the aroma. 338 charactersDanny1217, Sep 30, 2015

Julius pours a somewhat hazy/cloudy light orange color with good head retention and decent lacing.  On the nose, I get considerable orange citrus, with a hint of underlying gingersnap and light pine.  The flavor profile replicates the nose in this well balanced, not particularly hoppy IPA.  There is a considerable amount of tropical fruit as well, but the sweetness is nicely buoyed and balanced by the hops in this easy to enjoy and appreciate IPA.  Alcohol is well integrated into the flavor profile, and drinkability is terrific.
A very nice IPA, but as with Masala Mama some years ago, I'm a bit puzzled by the lofty review scores I see on BA.  Everyone is entitled to their opinion of course, but a score of 100?  Really?  That makes no sense to me.  Whatever, this is still a very fine, well crafted IPA from Tree House. 884 charactersJohn_M, Sep 29, 2015

It tastes so juicy and refreshing and sweet with a light bitterness at the end. Really really crushable and a fantastic beer from Tree House! 350 charactersW_Des, Sep 29, 2015
4.99/5  rDev +7.5%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured from a can, this beer was a bright golden-orange color with a good bit of haze and a frothy eggshell white head on top. This head stuck around awhile and mellowed slow leaving great lacing. The moment the can popped open the aroma of pineapple, citric, dank, pine resiny hops all filled the air and the release over the glass was intense. Some mango, and fresh bread and light honey aromas also came to mind. The flavor was a super drinkable citrusy, dank burst of fresh hops curtaining over a smooth, sweet malt base. The pineapple and mango tropical notes were clear in the taste too. A smooth beer with light carbonation and mellow bitter finish. Lots of flavor going on here and a top tier American IPA!! I am so glad I picked some up at the brewery and have been happily sharing it. Wish Treehouse brewery was closer. 829 charactersscottbrew4u, Sep 29, 2015

A - This is really the only thing I could fault this beer for. It's pure orange juice in appearance, which is lovely, but doesn't leave much room for comment. Decent head retention and lacing. But this isn't what you drink Julius for, anyway.
S - Here we go. This beer is insane. Massive tropical notes in the nose: mango, pineapple, melon, and a healthy dose of citrus as well.
T - At it's gravity, this is the juiciest, most full flavored IPA I've ever had the pleasure of trying. Delivers perfectly on all the promises made by the aroma. Finish is delicate and complex. Wow.
M - Thick and substantial, but ultimately quite drinkable. 
O - Again, for 6.8%, this is the best standard IPA I've ever had. Really just incredible. Now to work on a clone recipe! 856 charactersNordbier, Sep 25, 2015

Pours a yellow orange opaque color with a full finger of fluffy white head that lingered for a while with nice lacing.  Beautiful looking American pale ale.  Smells of oranges, mangos and other citrus fruits I cannot identify.  Want to say pink grapefruit.  Little hop smell too.  Taste is super citrus forward with a rush of mango and oranges.  Little hop bitterness on the back in but overpowered by the citrus. Really juicy.  Definitely more hoppy as it warms up and you drink it.  Really good but I'm not giving it a 100.  Thicker than most imperial pale ales.  Almost like a thin stout.  Really drinkable.  You could down a case on a hot summer day.  Ready glad I got to try this.  Excellent juice bomb. 714 charactersuvachief, Sep 24, 2015

As soon as the can is opened dank orangey, papaya fruit rolls out.
Tastes like you are sucking on a citrusy hop starburst. The mouthfeel is deceptively smooth for a beer that is this sticky. Slight dankness, but the most flavor is a pungent sweet orange juice. I would give this beer to someone who says they don't like IPA's because they are too bitter. 388 charactersRJIV, Sep 17, 2015
4.96/5  rDev +6.9%look: 4.25 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Received in a trade, only 8 days old.
I have to start by saying this beer does not look as pretty as most in a glass. It is super hazy. 
Besides that, this brew is amazing. 
It starts off with great tropical aromas, but when you taste it you can tell why it is so highly rated. The malt in this beer tastes great, light and biscuity, and after only a few seconds it gives way to those juicy, tropical hops.
The balance is amazing.
Another great New England beer, sorry West coast, but I think your time is up. 510 charactersTheBlueWaffle, Sep 17, 2015

4.76/5  rDev +2.6%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75I've had this a couple times before, but got a handful of really fresh cans from BA wuntrikpony, and after cracking a couple this weekend, I was inspired to write down my thoughts. Enjoyed out of the "new" can design with a canning date of 9/2. Poured into a Sierra Nevada IPA glass.
Appearance (4.25) - Right off the bat, the appearance is somewhat self-contradictory. On one hand, I might describe it as "murky", given the fact that the liquid is saturated with particulate, which prevents any ability to see through the glass whatsoever. However, one doesn't usually associate the word "murky" with something as vibrant and glowingly bright as the color of Julius. A golden orange hue beams out of the glass, as if the liquid is absorbing and then projecting all the sunlight it absorbs. If I didn't know better, I would say I just poured a glass of orange juice from this beer can. The head is a creamy, towering three and a half fingers of off-white that retains for several minutes before slinking away to reveal swaths of sticky lace and a persistent presence of moderately thick film across the surface of the liquid.
Smell (4.5) - The aroma wafting out of the can upon first cracking it is incredibly enticing, with veins of orange zest, sweet grapefruit and clementine, balanced/complemented by an fainter undercurrent of herbal notes, reminiscent of basil, thyme, and perhaps even some hints of floral nectar. But the citrus is clearly the star of this. Malt is only present enough to provide a little bready foundation for the fruity hop notes to shine. 
Taste (5.00) - I know it's not terribly descriptive, but WOW. I'm simply floored by how seamlessly the explosion of citrus and tropical fruit integrates with herbal notes--nothing bitter like pine or spruce, but more like basil or maybe marjoram. Tangerine and sweet grapefruit come through the most, but there is plenty of dryness to balance out the perception of the sweeter flavor profiles. Upon subsequent drinks, I start to get some mango and perhaps nectarine to balance out the citrus.
Mouthfeel (4.75) - Medium-bodied and moderate carbonation, with a juicy feel that finishes dry.
Overall (4.75), this might be my favorite IPA. It's juicy and fruity but with plenty of counterbalance to avoid it becoming one-note. I could drink multiple in a single setting if I had ample supply, but I tend to try and stretch it to no more than one per day so that I can truly enjoy everything that it has to offer. A fantastic beer from Tree House and one that I'm so glad they started to can. I plan on trying to continue trading for this into the future. 2,622 charactersLambicPentameter, Sep 14, 2015

5/5  rDev +7.8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Wow. Just wow. My second ever 5 on BA. Canned on 9/2. Pours an absolutely beautiful murky, hazy, cloudy, orange and peach. The nose is stunning. I could use this stuff as cologne every day. Orange, peach, mango, tangerine, passion fruit, so tropical and citrusy, just bursting out of my tulip. The taste doesn't disappoint. Perfectly sweet orange and peach upfront, transforms into a luscious mango before finishing with juicy tangerine. If the taste wasn't amazing enough, the mouth feel is possibly my favorite of any beer to date. It has a creamy and mouth covering feel that goes down so smooth and leaves a nice bitter tangerine aftertaste in your mouth. Will definitely seek out any tree house I can get my hands on after this experience. 744 charactersDustin_Sallitt, Sep 13, 2015
4.67/5  rDev +0.6%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.75Look: Deep orange. Very little head; 1/8 inch but fairly creamy. No transparency.
Smell: Fresh citrus hop aroma; blood orange (passionfruit?). Slight brown sugar richness.
Taste: Pretty rich; brown sugar thing going on. Definitely more of a bitter orange peel flavor than some citrusy beers. Fairly bitter bite to it.
Feel: Smooth mouth covering but that bitterness hits the back of the tongue a little aggressively. 
Overall: Unique among the style. Richer (maltier?) than most. Very delicious though, well balanced throughout but can't call it a 5 because of that off bitterness. 581 charactersdhitchcox, Sep 13, 2015

This is my first Julius and I'm already disappointed that I don't have another one to drink after this (yet....).  Pours opaque and murky almost like fresh squeezed orange juice.  Immediately hit with an intoxicating aroma of oranges  and ripe mango or peaches. There is also a pleasant dankness too it.  Taste is just a continuation of  juicy tropical  fruit with a bit of citrus pith and pine aftertaste that lingers.  So smooth and drinkable.  I've never given a beer a 5 before but I think this deserves it.  Too bad I don't have regular access this to this, cause my beer buying choices would be so much more simplified.  I wouldn't need to buy anything else I don't think. 698 charactersRoland7792, Sep 10, 2015

5/5  rDev +7.8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Here it is, the last of a 4-pack.  I already know it's the best IPA I've ever had, and the only IPA to which I've given all 5s, but now I'll do a formal review.  16 oz. can into a tulip glass.
A - This thing really pours like orange juice.  And not Tropicana; I mean the fresh squeezed stuff.  It looks like a peach if the skin of a peach were liquefied.  It's really an unbelievable color.  It just brightens up the room.
N - Peach juice.  Tangerine juice.  Juicy juicy juicy.  It's the juiciest beer I've ever smelled.  Not quite sure how they do this.
T - Gosh, the flavors and maltiness and hoppiness are just blended together so perfectly.  It's orange hop juice with a hint of alcohol.  It's clean on the finish, and just unbelievably drinkable.  It's just so damn impressive.  And I REALLY don't like IPAs very much.  I would drink one of these every day.
M - As with all the rest of the TH line, this thing immediately froth-ifies in my mouth.  It coats everywhere and goes down incredibly smoothly.  Extremely well-crafted.
O - There you have it, folks.  A perfect IPA.  A perfect beer. 1,100 charactersCraftFan5, Sep 07, 2015

I'd douse myself in it and my boyfriend would be in sheer HEAVEN!!!  Taste~okay here is where we get a little crazy because up until this point it's been a pure turn-on and tease.  Let me preface this by recalling a movie entitled When Harry Met Sally.  Remember Meg Ryan's rendition of a fake orgasm?  At first sip, expect this beer to cause the real thing...it's mind-blowing amazing.  Beautiful lacing from a pure white head, it's truly pillowy and extremely easy to drink.  For me, the peachy/apricot notes are prominent upon smell, opening up to strong notes of mango, papaya and a touch of melon to taste.  This beer lingers on the palate, so don't rush in for a second sip too soon!  Sit back and relive that first sip for a couple minutes...the finish is amazingly smooth and fresh!!  On a side note...this beer can be dangerously easy to drink and cause people to slip and say things they may be held accountable for:  Honey, am I really getting a diamond engagement ring within the next 6 months???!!  hehe!! ; ) 1,317 characterssusychpstk, Sep 07, 2015

5/5  rDev +7.8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Received in a trade with @DrunkyBuddha thanks dude!
Poured from a growler filled 08/22/15 
Look: hazy golden with 3 fingers of very fluffy head that leaves nice lacing
Smell:  I'm not sure I've ever smelled a beer like this. Once I opened the growler I'm hit immediately with huge citrusy dankness. As I go in for a good sniff, I get  ripe peach, lots of orange, and a touch of mango and pineapple mixed with a big burst of hoppy dankness. The smell is so well balanced. I wish they made cologne that smells like this.
Taste: It does not dissapoint given how wonderful the smell is. It just continues with amazing notes of smooth cantaloupe, a myriad of citrus and dank fresh grass. The swallow invokes a little scuppernong. 
Feel: Extremely smooth and has an almost fresh squeezed juice like feel to it. Medium carbonation.  Each sip leaves you wanting more.
Overall: Can an IPA be better made than this? I don't think so. There are others that can stand with this but I feel like it has truly reached a level that can't be passed. Well done Tree House! 1,054 charactersflskydiver, Sep 03, 2015

Julius is the man! the aroma of this isn't over powering, but it not going to kick you in the vag/nuts like some super hop aroma beers, but it's still something I would love in candle scent for my flat. This isn't a tea bag you in the mouth IPA, this isn't super malty like some regular IPAs can be, but it's just a very well balanced IPA. I'm not a big IPA fan but this hit the spot for me. Being in Tampa, I'm used to the maltier IPAs, so this was a refreshing change. I love the look of this. Nice and hazy. It felt great as Julius danced on my tongue and slid down my throat with little burn. 604 charactersSonnysideup, Aug 29, 2015

3.38/5  rDev -27.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 3 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 3.5The best way for me to describe this beer is, not what I expected.
Visually it is a great looking beer.  Slightly murky orange with a white foam head.  I had to dive right in.
The aroma was pushing a lot of citrus, not at all floral. I didn't expect it to knock me down with waves of citrus.
My first sip was a little off putting because the aroma did not match the flavor profile.  While it is juicy, I don't get a ton of the mango that they talk about on the side of the can.  That is a little bitterness at the front of your mouth but really, really faint.  And the bittering hop is less than desirable.  
I really wanted to feel the juiciness in my cheeks, instead I got a beer that leaves very little residual flavor and is borderline watery on the finish.  I feel like this beer wants to be a lot more than it actually is.  A strong citrus aroma that doesn't come through on the flavors and a hint at what could be a really good beer. 944 characterstroygreer, Aug 28, 2015

Re-visit:
16oz can into a snifter - 9 days old
L - same as before, thick and viscous, expect a chunk of hops to fall out of the can
S - Bright citrus - peel and juice.  Smells like the gunk left over after sending whole oranges through a juice machine
T  - this is just OJ.  Very big fruit forward citrus hops.  Good malt backbone.  Not great as it warms (gets harsh) but at 45 degrees this is very tasty
F - Medium bodied but smooth as silk 
Overall, very glad I revisited this beer - it is very tasty.  Not sure how much batch variation there is, and if I got the low and the high points but this is more inline with the hype.  Hopefully this enters my life again some time soon!
L - 4.5 - Hazy orange juice.  thick viscous pour, thin head but heavy lacing
S - 4.5 - Bitter orange juice with overtones of something else - reminds me very faintly of acetone?  Something volatile, but I don't think it is anything fusel
T  - 4 - Straight up orange juice to begin, with softly bitter hops coming in at the finish.  Somewhat sweet malts, and again just a hint of something volatile I just can't place.  Less perceptible as it warms up.
F 4.25 - Very soft velvety carb.  Medium bodied but smooth as silk
Overall (4), a very, very good beer, but with just a hint of something that is holding me back from going nuts.  Very good none the less, but there is a volatile, varnishy / thinners note to the aroma and the back of the palate that detracts slightly.

4.19/5  rDev -9.7%look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Can from the brewery, a few days old.
So here it is, the next in the lineage of famous/infamous semi-hard-to-get IPAs, instantly joining the ranks of Pliny and Heady, loved by the truest snobs when it's rare, and shunned by the same once everyone has had it. ;)
Attractive pour, cloudy orange-yellow, with a nicely-retaining white head. Hop-laden aroma, as would be expected, pithy, tropical, dash of ammonia. Citrus and tropical fruit in the taste, piney bitterness, and some fruit-candy sweetness as well, complementing the slightly sugary malt profile. Crisp mouthfeel, medium body, lasting hop bite. Overhyped to hell, but still very nice IPA overall. I'll take a Heady or Sunshine over this any day. 706 charactersRifugium, Aug 27, 2015

Pours a murky deep orange with a two finger off-white head. Looks like fruit juice.
Aroma is awesome. Get juicy aromas of peach, pineapple, mango, passionfruit, papaya, orange juice, orange peel, tangerine, and grapefruit from the hops. There is a very light breadiness and some pale malt sweetness. The smell indicates that this is going to be a wonderfully balanced beer.
Taste follows the aroma nicely. Up front get juicy peach, passionfruit, papaya, and mango. The pale malt sweetness is there. The middle brings more of the same, along with some very light breadiness, orange juice, and tangerine. The beer dries out just a touch into the finish. Some grassy and orange/grapefruit peel bitterness emerges. The sweetness carries on over into the finish, as well as the juicy peach and tropical notes. Complex and wonderfully balanced.
Mouthfeel is absolutely spot on. Very soft and creamy. Smooth carbonation. Medium body.
This was an absolute treat to have. There is a lot of complexity coming from the hops, yet the beer is nicely balanced. There is a reason why there is so much hype behind this beer. This one lives up to it. 1,165 charactersbrewskis, Aug 27, 2015

The color is a dark orange, which fits well with how much tropical fruit and citrus you get off of it. 
Smells like citrus, papaya, mango all sorts of tropical fruit. The taste is incredible, all of that fruit smell just showing up and man is it fresh. You swear you're not drinking a beer, especially one that is hovering on 7% ABV.

If there's a perfect India Pale Ale, Tree House has apparently solid their souls to the devil for the recipe. Stunning color, aroma, massive citrus flavor, but the key here is that while many great IPAs push the citrus envelope, there's another layer of complexity in this beer. Perhaps its the water profile, the hop bill and schedule, house yeast, but this beer is truly exceptional and nearly in a category all its own. 490 charactersSrs5768, Aug 25, 2015

Smell - Subtle, but fruity. Doesn't overpower you're senses
Taste - Amazing, hoppy, but not so much that it prevents your from tasting the citrus notes
Feel - Goes down smooth, delights your sense. It's a joy to drink this
I went in with pretty high expectations haivng had other Tree House beers and with the buzz around it. I can honestly say that this beer goes above and beyond and knocks it out of the park. I tried as much as possible to savor the experience and make it last, but you just want to take another sip and before you know it its gone. 611 charactersfalconator, Aug 21, 2015

So much tropical fruit with orange citrus upfront and finishes very smooth and piney. ALot of hop character. Overall 5/5 and this is defintely my favorite IPA right now. 404 charactersTheBrewBrotha, Aug 21, 2015

5/5  rDev +7.8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Tried from a fresh can poured into a teku glass.
Look - Cloudy, Orange glow in the glass with a nice head of bubbles that sticks around. I would give it a 5, typical peach nectar appearance I have come to expect with TH IPAs.
Smell - Takes over the senses with fresh orange citrus, tropical fruit and peaches. Some mild floral notes develop as well with a little time in the glass. The aroma is a perfect 5 IMO as it really delights the senses as well as anyone sitting close by.
Taste - ORANGE, ORANGE, and more ORANGE followed by complimenting tropical fruit and peaches. Smoother than 26.3 points per game and 20.2 rebounds per game (Dr.J at UMASS), this beer is extremely easy to drink. Very well balanced even though it's packed with juicy oranges the slight hoppy bitterness hade coming back for more. Perfect 5 stands up to other world class IPAS.
Feel - Light to Medium - this beer is so crushable with its ridiculously smooth body. 
Juicy citrus with a perfect balance of hoppiness that does not overwhelm the palate in a negative aspect. Also a great level of carbonation that makes this beer a real sensory explosion.
Overall - 5 out of 5 Easily in my fab five. I would drink this beer everyday if I could and not regret it. A tremendous effort by a young brewery that has me excited about every release. 1,320 charactersMatthewHopHead, Aug 20, 2015

4.99/5  rDev +7.5%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This beer absolutely lives up to the hype. The nose is the best I've ever experienced on an IPA (better than Heady) - huge citrus notes of orange, mango, et al (I don't really get the pineapple that a lot of people seem to mention). The taste follows the nose with a ton of citrus, but the most impressive thing is how balanced and subtle the bitterness is. There is an amazing hop oil finish to the taste that just makes you want to take another sip right away. It's extremely juicy, but still nails that balanced hop flavor that you expect from a great IPA. I could drink this all day.... 590 charactersbwrenn24, Aug 20, 2015

Pours a deep opaque orange with a fluffy white head that sticks around. Smell is super fruit, just pure orange and mango. OK, this is amazing, one of the best beers I've ever had. The mango on the tongue is so potent you could have told me this was juice. Notes of blood orange and pineapple, sweet malt, hint of grassy hop bitterness. The feel is so light and smooth. Drinks like a mango orange smoothie. Overall this beer deserves all the credit it gets. 516 charactersBranfordBound, Aug 18, 2015

5/5  rDev +7.8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Opened this growler and walked across the room to grab a glass. Stopped in my tracks, because I could suddenly smell it. From all the way across the room (a fairly large room). Tropical, citrusy juice. I have no idea how they achieved a nose like that, but I want it in my life every day. (Julius Candles, anyone?). 
Poured into tulip. Julius looks like, well Juice. Thick mango juice. It's beautiful. And I'm still not over that goddamn tropical juice nose. May have drooled into glass.
At this point in the experience I am a little nervous. Because it seems likely this beer can't possibly live up to that nose and look. But it does. I hate to say "pillowy-soft mouthfeel", because what the fuck even is that? But it describes what my mouth is feeling exactly. I swear to you. And the taste....I was expecting to be underwhelmed. I really was. But, continuing right in theme, this beer is straight juice. It is like drinking some tropical, citrusy, I should be on a beach right now, juice (I don't know any other word for juice-sorry). I could chug this beer if I didn't want the experience to last as long as possible. 1,123 charactersLorelle, Aug 18, 2015

A tropical citrus nose is predominant, with a hint of bitterness in the aroma.  Bitterness and citrus bursts out of the glass but blend well together to create a well balanced product.  Mouth feel is not exactly as astoundingly soft and cloudy as some of Treehouse's other offerings, but this is definitely an improvement over many other IPA's I've had.  Overall I would drink this again but probably not soon due to the limited availability and lack of distribution, however hopefully they will begin making this beer more en mass. 607 charactersChibeerguy1, Aug 14, 2015

Thanks to marino13412 for the awesome trade.
I drank this along side Haze and could not taste the difference, but this one was juicier. Juicy peaches and mangos. Super dank, but it's surprisingly got a clean finish. I think I prefer this one a little bit more. 371 charactersRollzroyce21, Aug 12, 2015
4/5  rDev -13.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Thanks to mdr4669 for these cans washing up on the shores of maximum12. Had a few samplers of Treehouse at tastings, but this is my first full pour. 16 oz. yellow/orange can that you won’t lose in the woods. 
The pour is a well carbonated & dense orange. As advertised, this smells like a hot, barefoot afternoon on Terre-de-Haut. The only fruit that jumps out in the nose is orange, but maybe that’s just a byproduct of the eyeful I’m getting. 
Julius is juicy. Whatever the taste, this beer is dripping with extra liquidity, & seems to stimulate my drool buds rather oddly. Bursting with fruitiness defined by peach for me, with low census counts of orange, citrus. Then the ends sticks you with a piney bitterness that lingers far longer than the career of anyone names Swarzak. Certainly easy to gulp, as this sixteen ounces isn’t going to live long. 
In name & style, this wouldn’t seem out of place in another eastern breweries’ lineup (though that place is well south of Treehouse). This doesn’t reach into the holy firmament of IPAs for my palate, but the stickiness & staying power make it a really good beer. 1,135 charactersmaximum12, Aug 12, 2015

4.78/5  rDev +3%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5L: Murky orange brew that looks more like a smoothie than a beer. Fluffy off-white head that looks like a washed out version of the body. Thick sticky lacing sticks around.
S: Orange and mango dominate the nose. Not sure if there's citra in the beer but it sure seems like there's a hint of it in the smell.
T: Holy F#*k! This thing tastes fresh squeezed fruit from a citrus grove. This is as juicy as a beer can get without being cloying or just gross. I would drink this beer exclusively if I could.
F: So soft but also so well carbed. Just enough hop bitterness there to keep the malt in check and keep it from being sweet. 
O: This is a beer I waited to rate because I wanted to make sure it was really the best beer I've ever had. As it turns out, it is. There is just so much right with this beer that it will haunt my dreams in between brewery drops. 857 charactersCayseyW, Aug 10, 2015

Poured from the 16 oz. can into a Tree House stemmed tulip.
a: Hazy amber with an inch thick white head which receded to thin surface foam and patchy lacing.
s: Moderate citrus and tropical fruits.
t: Follows the nose with a significant hop bite over a medium plus bready malt base.  Bitterness temporarily builds somewhat on the mainly dry finish.  Some dankness develops later.  Covers its ABV beautifully but leaves one imagining the same recipe could easily work with a DIPA strength ABV.
m: Medium plus, excellent body and good carbonation tingle.
o: A top flight quality IPA, substantial yet refreshing. 773 charactersscotorum, Aug 01, 2015

Appearance is a beautiful unfiltered orange color.
Smell is tropical and juicy. Orange is there, but also tropical fruits.
Taste is an explosion of flavor. Orange, Tangerine, and tropical fruit - you name it and it's there. Juicy juicy juicy beer - and with just the right amount of malt backbone behind it. This is the best tasting IPA I've ever had. I don't think it's possible to make one better - and I've had almost every top IPA on draft in the US.
If you have the opportunity to get your hands on this beer, do it! 680 charactersRichKent, Jul 31, 2015

Smells utmost juicy, of lime infused orange lemonade and an intriguing amount of grass. The aromas are very focused on the beers juiciness, which makes it perfect for a warmer day, revealing peach pulp among a pleasant dankness.
Has a soft mouthfeel till the end, in which a lively, very bubbly carbonation creates an outstanding refreshment, coating up a distinct hoppiness. 
Tastes of a soft fruitiness, entangled in dough whitebread malts, inviting the palate to a fantastic, soft mouthfeel. Its initial softness turns into a pleasant dank flavor, revealing wet grass, amped up by unripe orange peel and tangerine pulp. The malts then develop a natural sweetness, resulting from ripe orange, balanced by crisp lemon peel. Finishes with an outstandingly pleasant, exotic, fruitiness, sparkly carbonation and fitting, well pronounced maltiness which doesn't turn too sweet at no point.
Stunning, extreme rich, exuberant taste profile, leaving no desire unfullfilled as for what to expect from an ipa. Features a generous fruitiness, which offers up a great depth of hoppy flavors, perfectly illustrated by profound malts, which supports the gentle bitterness outstandingly well. 1,255 charactersaleigator, Jul 29, 2015

S - A straight orange juice bomb.  Wow, so much orange juice.  How do they make hops smell this way with no adjuncts?!  Its crazy.  Bitter orange peel, tangerines, sweet peaches, herbaceous.   Amazing nose.
T - Huge, huge, huge orange right up front.  Explosive juiciness.  Tree House has their beer dialed.  Orange peel follows, pithy orange middle of the mouth, bitter hops, crazy balanced with an awesome sweet citrus finish.
M - Medium, velvety smooth.  TH mouth feel is second to none it seems when it comes to hoppy beers.
O - as far as IPAs go, this is one of the best on the planet.  No holes to find.  The only way you don't like this beer, is if you don't like juicy citrus IPAs.  So fun to drink.  Highest of recommendations. 912 charactersjow_42, Jul 21, 2015

L- Pours a cloudy, murky orange with a bubbly two finger head that sticks around for a bit.
S- Aroma is a mix of tropical fruit and citrus, with a healthy note of dank hops. One of the more impressive IPA noses I've ever smelled. Smells like mango, orange, and hops.
T- Taste is more of the same. Strong orange rind and mango flavors hit the tongue first, followed by a really great hoppy bitterness. The taste lingers on the palate and encourages another sip. Perhaps slightly less bright than the nose, but this is truly an exceptional flavor profile.
F- The consistency is reminiscent of orange juice—just replace pulp with hop oils. Slightly thicker than other IPAs, and it totally works.
O- I tried hard to find faults in this beer and show how hype can impact a beer's ratings. Nope. Didn't happen. This is an unbelievably good IPA, and it's amazing how much flavor is packed into such a relatively low ABV. Seek it out. 959 charactersdjgustafson, Jul 21, 2015

The mango and orange come together so well and the creamy finish makes this very smooth with just the right amount of bitterness. Most of the pineyness lies in the nose with citrus dominating the flavor profile. Quite different than the west-coast IPA with is very earthy/piney. 90% of beers do not live up to the hype but this certainly does. 435 charactersworldsworstextra, Jul 19, 2015

Smells "juicy", mostly of citrus
taste is hoppy and a bit sweet with a slight bitterness at the end of the sip
feel is soft and not overly carbonated
overall, not a beer I'd go out of my way for. I've had it once from a growler and once from the can, both very fresh and it hasn't lived up to it's hype for me. 411 characters2ellas, Jul 18, 2015

A=Amber to copper, thick white head that slowly dissipates and rings the glass, lacing sticks to side of glass as I sip.
S=Citrus hits you first including orange, orange peel, grapefruit, lemon peel.  Some pine and resin hiding in there too.  Was expecting a bit more oomph based on all the reviews I have read, but still great!
T=Mostly citrus with nice malt backing and balance of bitterness, malt sweetness, and citrus and resinous hop flavors.
M=Lighter than expected body with moderate carbonation, smooth as silk.
O=Great citrus forward IPA, not my absolute favorite, but I would never turn one down, exited to try their other offerings. 700 charactersjhavs, Jul 16, 2015

Smell:  Citrus, strong grapefruit, orange with a trace of mango
Taste:  Ah, this beer lives up to its world class rating.  The balance of a moderate malt body the plays perfectly with the tropical hop flavors and bitterness.  The brilliance of this beer lies in this balance.  The bitterness lingers a bit but the overall citrus essence remains to the next sip
Feel:  The body is surprising light, with crisp smooth finish that begs for another sip
Overall:  One of the best American IPAs I have had and an exemplary example of an east coast IPA.  Saddened that it is not more readily available, but is a must try for any hop head 762 charactersinlikeflint, Jul 16, 2015

T:Best of the best. Follows the nose very well, you get tons of delicious fruit up front followed by a nice dank taste and ends with some delicious hop/pine taste. And the perfect aftertaste to follow
F: Amazing again, has that nice somewhat creamy feeling to it, while still being super refreshing and easy to drink.

Smells like fruit, tropical juice, mango, pineapple and orange.  Taste is incredibly crisp and refreshing.  Lots of bursting citrus followed by a lean bitterness, fading into bready malt.  Wonderfully balanced.  Leaves your mouth with a mild peppery zest and clean aftertaste.  Insanely drinkable.  Airs just slightly on the thinner/lighter side, but hardly worth mentioning.  If this glass was bottomless it's hard to say when you'd ever put it down.  This beer lives up to every bit of the hype. 570 charactersanteatr23, Jul 01, 2015

4.96/5  rDev +6.9%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5Poured from a 1 pint can into a Rhode Island Brewfest IPA glass.
The color is a very hazy orange with some nice light orange to yellow highlight around the edges. There is three fingers of foamy white head and some nice thick lacing left on the glass.
The aroma is very fruity with some juicy orange flavor and some nice tangerine. There some great lemon, peach, apple, banana, and even some green grape. There also is a light grassy note that is toward the back but slightly present throughout the nose.
The taste is fruity and slightly tangy with a candy-like flavor. There is more juicy fruit flavor here that takes your senses for a ride. There are hints or tangerine, navel orange, and some banana Now & Later thrown into the mix. There is a sugary sweetness that is like an orange flavored Pixie stick at both ends of the palette as soon as this beer hits the tongue.
The feel of this beer is big and bright with a nice drinkable feel. There is a really nice smoothness here that makes this goes by easy and even when the alcohol tries to make a presence the flavor distracts from things getting too heavy. A really great and tasty IPA, 1,146 charactersDuhast500, Jun 29, 2015

Spotty laces. The nose is orange zest to start, then hoppy bitterness and nectarine. The taste starts with a hop bite that goes to very nice notes of orange zest, nectarine, malt, and ends with a crisp hop bite. This is not over juicy but more bitter, like orange rinds. This is smooth, moderate carb, and moderate body.
This is a phenomenal beer. This is at the top of my list, worth the hype, worth the price, worth the hassle. The orange is there but not sweet, it's zesty 591 charactersmacher0, Jun 28, 2015

Julius poured a murky, copper gold color with a frothy white head that has decent retention, and leave sticky lacing on the glass. The nose was pretty awesome; aromas of mango, papaya, malty sweetness, and hints of orange undertones (not as much as you'd expect from the can's labeling). The flavor profile is similar to the smell, but a little subdued, and sweet. My favorite part about this beer was the mouthfeel. Super creamy! A+ on that. Overall, I thought this beer was great, but I've had several different offerings that I prefer. Still was a treat to enjoy minus the slight disappointment. 625 charactersbjmartin14, Jun 25, 2015

A: An orange haze, about half an inch of head, retaining well.
S: tropical goodness, lots of orange, mango, papaya.
T: A little hop bitterness up front, slight orange taste, lots of malt flavor, and not very balanced. This leans more towards the malty side, with you wishing there was more of this orange hop flavor that the can suggests.
M: very creamy, moderate carbonation.
Overall: This is a huge let-down. I went into acquiring this beer with huge expectations, and thought that maybe my canned version was sub-par so I sought out the growler version. A good IPA at best, don't believe the hype, go after Tree House's other awesome offerings like the Curiosity series, Haze, Double Shot or the elusive Good Morning. 792 charactersQueefLatina, Jun 15, 2015

Pours a hazy orangish-yellow color with one inch of white head and moderate carbonation evident. Lots of tropical fruits, citrus hops, fruity malts, oranges, mangos, zest, pine hops, taste is lightly bitter. Medium body and low to moderate carbonation, some light bitterness.
Overall a very, very good beer, but I actually prefer their Hazy and Double Shot. The nose is outstanding, while the taste is a little less tropical and lightly bitter. Would buy it all the time if I could. 602 charactersmdfb79, Jun 12, 2015

Beautiful hazy, bright, glowing orange with a pure white head.  Truly incredible aroma of orange juice and zest, mango, and several other lighter colored citrus fruits.  Some juicy strawberry comes through as well when it opens.  There is a backdrop of dank pine and very, very slight resin.  Almost no malt at all - just a slight breadiness that lays the foundation for the explosion of hop flavors.

I get notes of passion fruit, orange skin, mango, maybe even some pinapple.
Very bright citrus notes with just the right amount of hopiness and carb. It would be perfect to lay by the pool and sip on this on a hot sunny day. I french pressed some blackberry and blueberry into it and it just brought out more of the fruit. 436 charactersJonathanC, Jun 04, 2015

S - Damn, this is excellent- again just sweet sweet nectar
T - Appropriately named, this thing is straight juice. awesomely smooth - tons of orange, passion fruit mixed in a blender with added alcohol that is almost nonexistent.  
M - forget it, hands down one of the smoothest IPAs ever consumed. Maybe under carbonated(?) my only half-complaint
O - It's orange and beautiful and beer - BUT it's maybe its too juicy, I prefer the sticky/dank smell and taste..just my own taste preference, still an incredible beer. 622 charactersM_chav, Jun 03, 2015

S: ripe, juicy oranges, some darkness
T: same as the nose, juicy sweetness, with  just a touch of pith. refreshing. Like biting into an orange slice during halftime at a soccer game. 
F: again, juiciness dominates. Light, but with some body from the sweetness. Some dank and pithy bitterness comes on the finish. 
O: excellent. As close to an orange beer as you can get without actual oranges added. 499 charactersMissSmisje, May 31, 2015

5/5  rDev +7.8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Again I got this one from Hopsouras when he was on a business trip up in the NE. He said it had just rolled off the canning line when he was there and sent it express to me! Unbelievable! And it is Beeradvocates #1 American IPA. (I agree!)
A - Awesome dark orange color. Completely opaque with a perfect, fine white head and incredible lacing.
S - Super pungent hop fragrance with lots of orange, mango, pineapple, pine, and dankness. Absolutely amazing in the nose. Just like the best IPA should smell like. No getting around it there is a ton of hops squeezed into this beer.
T - Unbelievable flavor with the strongest orange, tangerine, passion fruit hop character predominant followed by mango, pineapple, dank, and pine notes. It is very smooth and refreshing with a light malt sweetness in the middle but very minimal compared to the hop blast. The hop bitterness is also present but not a wrecker like a DIPA, really just a nice palate cleanser. 
M - Medium mouth-feel with moderate carbonation. Perfect IPA feel with enough resin and malt to give it a good body but enough carb and bitterness to keep it crisp and refreshing.
Overall, I would agree with most tasters and say that this is the best (SINGLE) IPA I've ever had. Like I said the tremendous orange hop character is awesome and there is still a ton of tropical fruits, pine, and resin to really make your taste buds pop! The body and balance is great with the malt backbone. The bitterness is clean and crisp without any bite. I definitely stress the "single" IPA aspect since there isn't the alcohol, thickness, or bitter bite that comes with a DIPA but make no mistake they used "DOUBLE" the hops for this awesome beer!

4.17/5  rDev -10.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25To be completely upfront on my review: 
This was acquired in a trade that was 'completed' around Jan 20, 2015 -- sent USPS. The package 'disappeared' from the tracking info within two weeks. They told the shipper it was gone, undeliverable, discarded. 
Well, it showed up on my doorstep on May 19, 2015, box smashed to hell. BUT!! This one, the one I was looking forward to most in the beermail, made it! I didn't expect much, hell...a growler, 4 months old, undoubtedly sitting somewhere not refrigerated for the longest time...but then, I popped the cap after a night's chill in my fridge.
*slight gush* Oh my....there's still carb in this bad boy! Enough for a finger and a half or so of head upon pour. And it smells of fresh melons still!
The flavor was great on it as well, although probably not as sharp as Treehouse intended due to its origins, journey, and age. But it was still delicious! I would love to try this one fresh, now that I've had it in its pitiful, but beautiful, state as it was. 
100% impressed even with the one that I got, a beer that I'll be thrilled to try again, especially in a can. 1,118 charactersthatoneguymike, May 20, 2015

A- murky orange with huge, soapy, off-white head. Moderate lace as the glass empties. 
S- orange upfront along with some mango and grapefruit.  Really sweet citrus going on here. 
T- orangey citrus with a bit more malt presence than expected. Great balance. Not too bitter or dry. 
M- oh my goodness! Best feel ever on an IPA!  So balanced and creamy. 
O- my expectations were pretty high and this is a really great IPA. Not perfect, but definitely holds it's place up there with the big boys. 553 charactersJamesStreet, May 20, 2015

Beautiful, and I mean beautiful, cloudy/hazy golden-orange color with a decent bright white head. Poured much better out of the growler than the can, oddly enough. Whole lotta citrus and other tropical fruit. Very soft and fragrant in both the nose and the taste. I get some malt, too, which was unexpected. Just not as much going on as I had hoped. Incredible drinkability and feel. Like cream. Good finish, slightly bitter and piney. To be honest, it didn't blow me out of the water like I expected it would. I think the growler was better. Still fantastic, though. 663 charactersGatch, May 13, 2015

A - Poured a very dark orange; cloudy and opaque.  A thin layer of cream coloured head. 
S - Orange, grapefruit, mango and a hint of caramel sweetness. 
T - A sharp bitterness up front with juicy peach, mango, tangerine and passion fruit notes.  A hint of caramel/honey adds the perfect amount of sweetness.  
M - Medium body, chewy and oily.  Light carbonation.  The perfect IPA mouth feel. 
O - This lived up to the hype for me.  Hopefully I will be able to revisit this one at some point. 563 charactersTheSevenDuffs, May 10, 2015

Creamsicle orange with pronounced haze and a finger of off-white foam. Enough residual lacing to give me flashbacks of previous girlfriends. Can't wait to dig in. The nose gives hints of guava, mango, and peaches. A hint of over ripened tangerines and fresh baked bread as it warms. The taste is an abundance of tropical juices, with some peppered grapefruit on the finish. The alcohol is barely detectable, and the mouthfeel is a tad creamy. At 6.8% abv, they packed a ton of flavorful hops in this beer, and it shows. If you find yourself in Monson, MA, do yourself a favor and pay a visit to Tree House Brewing. These guys have created a world-class IPA that lives up to the hype. I think I'll have another. Larrrrrrrrrge. 769 charactersTheIPAHunter, May 09, 2015

A: Pours a cloudy darkish orange, with two fingers of orange juliuis-tinted, exceptionally fine head.  Extremely murky.  Superb retention and wide swaths of lacing.
S: Loads of citrus (orange juice, tangerine), a bit of malt, some lemon.  Apricot as it warms.  A bit muddled.  
T: Incredibly juice like.  Candied orange, some mango and white grapefruit, a strong floral note, an undertone of pale malt, and a mild, nearly moderate, bitterness towards the back end rounds this out a bit on a long-ish finish.  Apricot as it warms.  Again, the flavors are delicious but a bit muddled.
M: Medium-full body and a crisp, medium carbonation that cuts through it.  
O: Delicious.  This is almost more like drinking orange/mango juice than beer, and I say that in a not completely negative way.  But that means I’m not entirely sure how I feel towards it.  In any case, it’s not quite a god-tier IPA like Alpine Nelson or Heady, but it’s very tasty. 1,028 characterspmarlowe, May 09, 2015

4.78/5  rDev +3%look: 4.25 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Pours a hazy, copper-orange color with a 2 finger off-white head that dissipates very quickly. Leaves some decent, splotchy lacing. 
The aroma is intoxicating. So much citrus and so much tropical fruit it's absurd. Sweet orange and tangerine notes, as well as grapefruit and pineapple, followed by a touch of pine resin. There's a lot of mango and peach as well. Just so much going on here. 
The taste is a juice bomb. I get tons of orange, grapefruit, and pineapple, as well as some honeydew melon. The finish is slightly bitter. 
The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Fluffy, smooth, and creamy. 
Overall, one of the best IPA's I've ever had. The aroma is ridiculous and the flavor follows suit. Definitely lives up to the name. 754 charactersScaryEd, May 08, 2015

I don't think it holds a flame to some other IPA options out there, especially in the NE region.  While it's got a great smell and taste, it had a tad too much malt presence and was not as citrus or juicy as anticipated.  Still a great beer, but not a 100 score for me.

Appearance:  A one finger head was poured that reduced to a thin layer.  It is hazy pale orange color with some clarity of bubbles coming up through the glass. 
Smell:  Tropical, citrus, grassy, pungent, herbal, toasted, bready, and caramel malts. 
Taste:  Pretty much similar to the aromas.  Nice juicy hop flavor, balanced malt backbone, slight bitterness, slight chewiness, and some yeasty notes.
Mouthfeel:  Light to medium bodied, light bitterness, a little chewy, refreshing, and medium carbonation. 
Overall:  A very nice tropical and citrus juice bomb with a malt backbone to back things.  I'll revisit this one in the future. 684 charactersFlounder57, May 04, 2015

4.46/5  rDev -3.9%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Appearance- Orange amber in color, turbid, and pours a two inch head.
aroma- Orange citrus, mango, passionfruit, and pineapple.  
Taste- Juicy orange and tangerine citrus flavors are big upfronnt.  The middle of mouth sees a mild amount of bitterness for an ipa and some mango and pineapple flavor. The finish ends as it began with juicy passionfruit and orange citrus and an a really soft finish.
feel- Medium bodied, medium carbonation, soft as beer gets, a little thick from all the sediment/yeast/etc, and pretty clean in the finish.
overall- For this intended style of ipa this is about as good as it gets.  Incredibly juicy hops (to the point where you think fruit is actually added) plus a really soft feel. Overall as an ipa, its definitely great but I think it could benefit from a little more balance, primarily from some more bitterness or non-fruity flavors.  Still, that is really nit picking, and this a really unique beer that is well worth the praise. 971 charactersCTbrew32, May 03, 2015

Very strong citrus flavor and definitely on the tropical fruit spectrum. Could be just me, but wasn't entirely what I expected. I realize I'm probably in the minority here, but wasn't super impressed because, although the flavor was there, I was hoping for a little bit more of the hoppy bite. The citrus flavor was probably a bit too strong for my liking, but that obviously doesn't take away from this as being a finely crafted beer. Will say that I found the Curiosity 15 to be more to my liking. 554 characterspja786, Apr 28, 2015

5/5  rDev +7.8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I picked up a 6 pack of this at the brewery on 4/25/15.
A: Bright orange, hazy in color with a nice foamy white head.
S: Immediately i'm struck by strong orange notes that subside into some pine, grassy character.
T: The orange is definitely there, but it's not overpowering, has a nice sweet backbone combined with some mild piney hops. Very balanced between the hop kick and the sweetness. Almost no bitterness to it.
M: Extremely smooth, seems almost perfectly balanced. Medium carbonation, creamy finish.
O: Wow, I actually had a dream a few nights ago that I'd land a can of this and I ended up getting 6!!!! I thought i'd never try it. It's exceptionally smooth, balanced, and yet has a nice hoppy kick to it combined with the citrus component. 5's all around!!! This brewery makes me proud to be from Western Mass!!!! 824 charactersCoffeePorter, Apr 26, 2015

Pours a bright orange, super hazy body with a big thick white head that reduces slowly to leave pretty heavy lacing. Looks fantastic.
Lots of citrus on the nose.. orange rind, bright fruity hops, some resinous aromas, orange juice. 
Wow.. very interesting on the tongue.. sweet citrus, orange, juicy notes, orange creamsicle, tropical fruit, followed by a nice subtle hop bite on the finish. Mouthfeel is absolutely PERFECT. This is one of the most delicious, drinkable beers I've ever tasted. Creamy, easy drinking, refreshing mouthfeel with medium carbonation. Perfect.
One of the best  IPAs I've ever tasted. I can't believe how easy to drink this beer is, while being packed with flavor. Wish I could drink this every day. 843 charactersgcamparone, Apr 25, 2015

A - Deep, opaque peach juice body with a full two fingers of creamy white head.  Nice lace and ok retention.
S - Sweet orange concentrate, ruby red grapefruit, peach nectar, mango.  About as pure citrus as I've ever smelt in an IPA.
T - Really interesting; extraordinarily drinkable.  Nectarines, white grapefruit juice, honey, peach nectar, and softly bitter grape leaves.  Basicity malt finish.  The net sweet profile is absolutely loaded with fruit, with just enough pithy and leaf-like bitters to balance it out. 
M - Smooth and full for the style.
O - A delicious and highly accessible IPA that benchmarks what the best of the fruit-forward side of the style can be. 733 charactersvfgccp, Mar 29, 2015

As soon as you get it open (I was lucky to try it out of a can) the smell of orange/citrus are pungent throughout the room.  In the glass it goes, gorgeous orange color with a frothy white head that fades with time.  The taste of this beer follows the nose 100%--its a tropical fruit explosion.  One of my favorite parts was the mouthfeel--I wish I could give it a 6.  Creamy, perfect amount of carbonation.
This beer is perfection.  Trade for this/go to Tree House, just get some.  I promise you won't regret it 604 charactersTbub18, Mar 22, 2015
4.63/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5This beer will make you smile. 
Think of the joy you got as a child out of a summertime Orange Creamsicle, then imagine that same joy being transferred in the form of an adult ice cream flavored beer. 
Julius is a juicy IPA that tastes like fresh orange slices pureed into beer. It is one of the best IPA's on the market. 
I know that Tree House has some of the most ardent fans in the craft beer scene, and at first I honestly thought that the hype surrounding this beer was due to strong hometown Homerism, but this one really lives up to its reputation as one of the finest in the game. 
Two thumbs up. 
Note: The taste drops off very quickly in a growler (within three days or so based on eight growler fills) but the flavor in the cans lasts for up to five weeks. Given the option, I would seek out the cans for the full Julius experience. 850 charactersrodmanfor3, Mar 21, 2015

4.93/5  rDev +6.3%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Brilliance in a bottle is an understatement for this highly reviewed IPA. Began the evening with a 750ml bottle from the previous weekend's batch. The color pours into my Hill Farmstead tulip glass a perfect pale golden tone. The smell of orange, grapefruit, and citrus fills the air immediately when opened. Freshly squeezed orange grapefruit juice with the mild bitterness of hop to give it that classic taste. A beautifully crafted IPA and easily one I will go out of my way to try again. Cannot recommend the aesthetic quality of this enough.

Revised Review of the recent can releases: While the aromas and juicy flavor is still intact, it does not have the same freshness feeling as I get straight from the growler or draft. 735 charactersWolvesinthetaproom, Mar 19, 2015
4.65/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5LOOK: Color: a marvelous gold yellow orange. Almost opaque but not cloudy.
SMELL: Aroma is great -- like citrusy blossoms.
TASTE: Big citrus flavor. Hoppy as hell but balanced, not overly bitter. Bright and sunshiney up front. Very pleasant. The easy comparison is Sip of Sunshine. Quite possibly better than. Really similar flavor profiles though.
FEEL: As for mouthfeel: not quite (like) "stout full", but pretty full for an IPA.

To me this sits right next to Lunch by Maine Beer for best IPA. The only thing about it that turned me off at all was it sat heavy in the nose,  awesome mango/citrus in your face but nail polish remover also came to mind. (and this is not a complaint for sure, it wasn't overwhelming) As for taste it's cleannn from beginning to end; Hop hits hard and then the fruitiness at the end makes you want more and more. Dank and delicious! Top 5 IPA IIPA 539 charactersBerkshireGuerrilla, Feb 01, 2015

It may not be the absolute perfect tasting IPA I've ever had, but it really is a bit of a curveball from the average IPA flavor profile. Like it's name might possibly suggest, this baby is all oranges: orange rind, orange pulp, orange juice, Tang, orange gummy bears. The potency of the oranges becomes even more apparent as the beer warms to room temperature. I'd even suggest drinking Julius at a chill level closer to room temperature because the flavors really expand. From Tree House, I personally prefer Green, but Julius is a lovely little beast. 616 charactersMakeMineADoubleJack, Jan 19, 2015

Hazy opaque orange yellow. One finger settles to a white layer of tiny dense bubbles. Trace of lacings. 
Amazing aroma. Mango, tropical hops
First sip, tropical hops on the middle and them the front of the tongue. A gentle,msmooth lingering hoppy bitterness aftertaste on the back of the tongue. Second sip the the tropical hops are all on the tip. Slight pine note on the third sip. 
Silky smooth, tiny sudsing. Well made, smooth and delicious.
Excellent beer. I will be climbing back into the tree house. 679 charactersWunderLlama, Dec 19, 2014

Definitely juicy. A little dank(?) but not in a bad way, just unique. Nice balance of hop and malt. This is good but not as mind blowing as I hoped. Happy I had the chance to try it but not sure I'd seek it out again. Perhaps a little fresher and it would be amazing. 308 charactersZaximus, Dec 12, 2014

Bursting with tropical, orange hop smell with a hint of dankness. Bitter orange flavor with tropical hop flavors shining through as well. Great mouthfeel, carbonation is a bit lower out of the can than out of the growler I had previously. One of the best out there right now. 355 characterscostanzo_mike, Nov 29, 2014

Still good lacing and still 2+ finger frothy head. Such a strong smell. Dank orange juice and other citrus. Hint of pine. Absolutely fresh taste. Both sweet and bitter orange. Really get a background juicy sweet mango. Other citrus and tropicals I can't place. Super juicy but carbonation is a tad low. Leaves a sticky sweetness like I ate a Starburst or something. Phenomenal beer. 462 charactersHootie159, Nov 29, 2014

S: Honeydew, which I don't think I've ever found in an IPA before, loads of crushed citrus, mostly orange and grapefruit and just a touch of ripe peach. Smells awesome.
T: Again, honeydew and cantaloupe right off the bat. Very different. Pineapple, a little bit of peach, honey malt and just a hint of grapefruit pith bitterness before a juicy finish of pink grapefruit and light pine. Delicious. 516 charactersnotchucknorris, Nov 09, 2014

Appearance - Very hazy orange body.  Big white head with nice lacing and a chunky collar.
Smell - Orange hops.  Metallic sort of aroma.  Some toasty malt.
Taste - Tastes much better.  Tropical fruits.  Orange.  Lightly toasty cracker malt.  A bit of sweetness backs it up.  
Mouthfeel - Medium body.  Kinda creamy.  Medium carbonation.
Overall - This is good, but I don't get the crazy high ratings it has.  I could definitely drink lots of this and would be happy drinking it all the time, but not sure it's top 50 caliber. 566 charactersAlieniloquium, Nov 04, 2014

A: Orangey haze with thick foamy head (3/3)
S: Sweet passionfruit and pineapple nose (11/12)
T: Passionfruit dominates with grapefruit. Still trying to figure out what that after-taste is but I get it in a lot of IPAs it is similar to finishing some salsa and it is mildly unpleasant . Can't taste after second sip. Otherwise perfect. (18/20)
M: Medium bodied and bubbly, super wet but a little dry on finish. (5/5)
O: A delightful IPA defying the piney hop bombs with a very rich complexity.  I like fruit, and I like beer.  This guy has both in spades.  (9/10)

4.75/5  rDev +2.4%Just wow. Gorgeous orange sunset in the glass. Wafts of grapefruit, sticky resin and a hint of pine. Flavor follows the nose profile: Notes of grapefruit, tangerine, nice stickiness and the undernote of pine again. This is a single IPA that has the huge flavor and juiciness of a double. Reminds me a bit of HF's hoppy offerings. Balanced, sophisticated and great. Look forward to trying more Treehouse. 403 charactersjjdc, Oct 30, 2014

4.7/5  rDev +1.3%Just an amazing representation of the single IPA.  Tree House pretty much knocks it out of the park with everything they brew and it's obvious why Julius is the flagship.  I've been fortunate and have had many offerings from them and they produce the finest beer in MA, hands down.  That's considering the stiff competition from others like Trillium, Pretty Things, etc...
In my mind, Julius is best described as a blast of citrus followed by a dank, earthy rustic backing that  glides to the finish.  Could pretty much replace your  morning OJ with this one! 560 charactersErockruns, Oct 29, 2014

The pour into a snifter is hazy darkish orange with a finger or so of white head, retention and lace are great. This one is huge on citrus and tropical fruit hops, big time melon, mango and oranges stick out the most, with a little bit of weedy/leafy hop. Quite bitter with just a little bit of sugar cookie malt backing. Smooth, well-carbonated mouthfeel, the heft and bitterness of this is surprising for 6.5%. Could pass for a DIPA.
I prefer Green to this personally but still a pretty great IPA. 620 charactersChico1985, Oct 07, 2014
4.35/5  rDev -6.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5A- My second 750ml of this throughout the last week. Poured into two snifters with a slightly hazed apricot amber body. The head is white and foamy, frothy textured rising to about one finger. Decent retention and lacing is a mix of webs, sheets and spots.
S- A lot of melon and juicy cantaloupe bursts out of the growler as soon as it is opened. After some inspection a bushel of juicy tropical and stone fruits rises out of the glass. Mango, tangerine, peach and some citrus as well.
T- Becomes a bit more citrus forward here with a notable zesty bitterness coming to mind. Orange is quite big with a bit of lemon zest in there as well. The fruits from the nose carry over with mango, melon, cantaloupe, peach, apricot and general tropical fruits coating the palate.
MF- Medium bodied with a slightly creamy and frothy consistency. Carbonation still at a high level after a week in the growler. Finishes moderately bitter.
Very juicy fruity in the nose as well as the flavor but in the latter a nice bitter citrus zest hop feel opens up. Certainly a great "flagship" or staple of a brewery. I have had this a few times now and it seems to just get better and better. 1,172 characterscbutova, Oct 06, 2014

4.94/5  rDev +6.5%The beer comes in a deep rich orange. Looks like fruit juice with a splash of blood orange.
The aroma explodes of tropical mango, peaches, papaya, mandarin orange, sweet nectarine, white peaches, with a touch of sweetness. Literally sugary tropical fruit candy.
On the palate, one first notices a creaminess that rolls on the tongue, almost as if oats were added, despite the beer being very clean and dangerously drinkable for its ABV. The beer offers nectarine, green mango, papaya, mandarin orange/tangerine. The middle has some green grassy herbal. A good amount of yeast dough comes throughout. The finish ends with grapefruit pith. How this beer flies off the palate and the very gentle bitterness makes this drink towards a 5% brew.
This beer tastes absurdly close to an HF brew, notably Susan. I give Susan the slight edge, but this is the 2nd best IPA I’ve had. 875 charactersdar482, Sep 26, 2014

4.7/5  rDev +1.3%Growler courtesy of Cam....oh man, what a great surprise. Thank you buddy!
Rich orange, big fluff, pillows of lace....wow!
Big waves of citrus...orange, tangerine, nectarine...so damn fruity.
Huge notes of citrus here as well, baby aspirin, some caramel and bready malts for firm yet welcomed support, and a light grassy bitterness that keeps things honest. 
Sweet and lightly syrupy but modestly carbonated allows this to feel juicy as well.
So much to like here and just a ridiculous amount of fresh hops and citrus twang with enough malt support and gentle bitters to keep everyone playing nicely. Damn Cam...thank you! 627 charactersBarrytheBear, Sep 06, 2014

5/5  rDev +7.8%This beer is something else. The one word that I will forever associate with Julius is FRESH! It tastes so dang fresh. The hops smell as though you were holding them fresh picked in your hands. Seriously. The flavor is off the charts and for a sub 7% abv ipa, it is packed full of hop flavor! With all that being said, this beer isn't a hop bomb like a west coast style. Its well balanced like Heady topper with a touch of sweetness to even things out. One of my favorite IPAs of all time. wow. 494 charactersMWilcox20, Sep 04, 2014

4.45/5  rDev -4.1%Big thanks to Deuane for cracking this growler open at Campground Brewdown.
A - Pours hazy peach orange with a beautiful one and a half finger tall white head, quickly dissipating down to a thin white film, leaving sticky webs of lace on the sides of the glass.
S - Smells of freshly zested tropical fruit, a whole field worth of fresh cut grass, sticky pine resin and some mild caramel sweetness. The hops are so strong but not totally over the top. 
T - Starts off much more balanced than the nose. The piney, grassy, tropical fruit hop punch is there in spades but the slightly sweet caramel malt is there to hold it in check for the most part. The finish is nearly identical but the bitterness does eventually win out, leaving the palate quite dry.
M - Medium body with moderate carbonation. Smooth, hoppy feel with plenty of dryness backing it up. The hops meld amazingly well with the base grain.
O - One of the better IPA's I have had in recent memory. The hops are intense and yet they don't destroy the palate. Now that I have friends in the area I am really looking forward to visiting them in the near future to try all these beers on-tap. 1,155 charactersorangesol, Aug 17, 2014

A- Hazy deep orange body, one finger white head with the right amount of retention and rings of lacing. Great lookin' beer. 
S- Juicy citrus, grapefruit and sweet bready pale malt. I don't know how this smells so good, but it does. Again this is really dang juicy. I understand where the name comes from now.
F- Somehow, this beer tastes better than it smells. Citrus, oranges, grapefruits, mango, passion fruit, bread and caramel with more oranges and a slightly grassy citrus finish. Really juicy but balanced. Fantastic stuff.
M- Medium bodied, smooth and creamy with a nice peppy carbonation. Phenomenal and very drinkable. Juicy, citrus zesty finish that is bitter but just the right amount of bitter grassiness to keep it interesting without interfering with drinkability.
O- Fantastic IPA. This one is worth its weight in gold... and more. Probably the most enjoyable single IPA I've had the chance to drink. I will have to obtain more of these on a regular basis! 1,049 charactersStevedore, Aug 11, 2014

4.53/5  rDev -2.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Pours a very hazy but luminescent apricot colour. A nice foamy head recedes rather quickly leaving a thin ring around the edges of the glass.
Smells pretty sweet with a lot of tropical notes like lime, mango, passionfruit, and orange. A bit of dank/grassy aromas in the background.
Tastes much like it smells, with a slightly more resinous flavour. It starts sweet with mango & lime, then moves toward passionfruit and a bit of resin. There's a little more dankness than the nose, which lends a hint of something like onion.
Fantastic pillowy mouthfeel, with a medium body and ever so slightly drying alcohol on the finish. 626 charactersIan_B, Aug 10, 2014

Aroma is oranges, kiwis, and peaches with a little pine. Intense fruity taste. Peaches, apricot, papaya and cantalope with a few distinct hop layers. Tastes like an amazing fruit that doesn't exist. Sweet hop resin absolutely coats your tongue at the second half of the sip. Intense hop character without being overwhelming. Finishes dry but because of the lingering hop coating on the tongue it doesnt feel like a normal dry finish. I don't think I've ever had a beer before that I just couldn't stop drinking like this one. I barely put the glass down. Treehouse is up there with the best of the best. So psyched to have such a badass brewery here in MA. 744 charactersbeerjunky413, Aug 08, 2014

Not that I really dislike clear IPAs. Eh. The head is white and fairly vigorous for a growler pour. Lots of lacing. Good retention. Even after a few minutes and many sips, there's still a solid coating of bubbles on top. The aroma is massively juicy and full of hop flavor. Citrus for days. I remember reading BuckeyeNation use the term "electric tangerine" in a review; that would be a very apt descriptor for this beer. It smells like tangerine juice with a healthy shot of lime. There's also pineapple, kiwi, raspberry, grapefruit and pine. It's like a wonderful citrus drink spiked with a tropical fruit background. Mouthwatering stuff. Little malt presence, which is just fine with me. Taste is similarly big on juicy hop flavors. Pale malt sweetness is well in the background. Tangerine, grapefruit and lime hoppiness dominates with tropical fruits providing highlights. Moderate bitterness. Fairly dry. Tangerine rind finish. Extremely easy to drink. Light, pleasant feel. Seems like normal carbonation. Some hop oiliness. Each sip makes me want more. I feel a bit bad not sharing this growler, but I'm also glad that I didn't. This is a fantastic IPA, fully deserving its acclaim. Tree House continues to impress. 1,331 characterspopery, Jul 27, 2014

poured into a pair of HF wine stems.
Appearance: Opaque orange bodied beer with large bubbled creamy white head that is 3 fingers tall. Lots of thick lacing and the head has really good staying power.
Smell: Oranges, orange rind, and mango. Hint of bready malts. Light dank hop notes a hint of pine and grapefruit.
Taste: Almost moderate bitterness level. Sweet oranges, tangerines, mango, passion fruit, and orange zest on the front end. Light juicy pine resin, juicy ruby red grapefruit, and dank hop note in the finish.
Mouthfeel: light bodied almost a medium body beer. Moderate carbonation. Creamy and oily mouthfeel. Hop oils adds just a little bit of dryness to contrast with the creamy mouthfeel. Very drinkable.
Overall: Julius has a pretty strong reputation. This is the second best IPA that I have drank. Sip of Sunshine is better than Julius in my opinion.  I definitely get the Orange Julius reference that the brewer was going for... This beer is very orangy and this is the deepest shade of orange colored beer that I have ever seen. 1,109 characters4DAloveofSTOUT, Jul 25, 2014

A - Hazy yellow golden pour that forms a 2 finger white head with awesome lacing. Looks somewhat like King Sue in the glass. Clearer carbonated orange juice.
S - Smells like Citrus, mango, orange, and hops. Soooo juicy smelling, can't get over this.
T - Taste follows the most with huge notes of passion fruit, mange, orange, citra hops. This is one of the best Citra beers that I have experienced and would place this right between King Sue and PsuedoSue in terms of just how smooth and creamy this is.
M - Creamy medium bodied smooth awesome beer.
O - This is definitely in the top 5 IPA's for me. For a single IPA, this is my favorite that I have had. Will definitely be seeking this one out again. Thanks Rich 866 charactersdrmcleod10, Jul 04, 2014

Appearance - hazy golden orange. Beautiful appearance.
Smell - very tropical and hoppy. One of the better smelling brews my nose has experienced.
Taste - hoppy and very tropical. You can taste the passion fruit, mango, orange favors...
Mouthfeel - alcohol undetectable, very smooth
Overall - I love the very tropical hoppy taste and the smell is ridiculously good. While this is not a DIPA, I think the flavor is similar to and rivals Heady Topper. So good! I can't wait to return for more!!! 595 characters311bulldog, Jun 21, 2014

Not getting any pine or rind on the nose. Very bright and juicy. Taste is right there. Not slick and bitter like a west coast IPA but not malty either. Perfect balance that has enough malt to carry the sweet tropical fruit flavors. I don't really get citrus or pine from this. It is much different than most other IPAs, which makes it so delicious. Very easy drinking and tasty. 487 charactersPHBoiler, Jun 02, 2014

I know Julius has been their flagship beer for a few years, but I finally got a few bottles a couple of weeks back. Unbelievably complex yet drinkable Imperial IPA. Poured into a Treehouse tulip. ALL of their beers have great lacing on the glass, but this one especially. Its a beautiful golden orange hazy glow. Mouthfeel is big and soft with great citrusy and grapefruit notes. The description they list on this beer is spot on. I get why people wait in lines for this beer. Its THAT good. These guys are making noise in this industry, and they are only getting better!! 612 charactersMarkAvery, May 22, 2014

Growler to Tree House tulip
750ml
Thanks to Rudzud and Jlindros for this one
App- A very soft and hazy orange with a bit of peach pink in there. A bit cloudy and a bit dense in the center. A small one finger head was there and leaves some good cling down the side. A bit of a pond water top with random bubble patches. Looks good in the glass.
Smell- This is a good smelling IPA. A bit soft on the bombardment of hops, but instead is dominated by a lot of tropical fruits. The citrus notes really dominant and control the whole thing. A light alcohol wofts up on a big pull of the nose.
Taste- I really enjoyed the domination of the fruits on this one. Certainly controlled by the aggressive hopping on this one. The malts are subtle and take a while to find on this one. The dominate citrus is very well layered and one sip will give some mango while the next is a little peach and passionfruit.
Mouth- To me this was a balance of a medium to a slightly thin body with a very good carbonation level. Saturated by hoppy and floral remants the residual flavors are citrus dominated with a little bit of booze.
Drink- A very well layered and delicious IPA. Thank you Jared and Matt for giving me the chance to review this one. The floral and citrus work wonders together. 1,295 charactersFosterJM, May 19, 2014

Pours a hazy orange with a dense, frothy one-finger head that subsides over the course of a minute or so, leaving plentiful cobwebby lacing.
Smells...wow. Smells like orange juice laced with weed, if such a thing were to exist. Huge orange with pronounced mango and passionfruit underpinnings, as well as dank and earthy floral hop notes. Neck-and-neck with Bissell Brothers' The Substance for best-smelling single IPA I've ever had.
Taste follows the nose almost to a tee, and that is by no means a bad thing. Opens with a tremendous burst of fresh-squeezed orange juice, with passionfruit, mango, pine sap, and lightly toasted caramel malt appearing mid-palate. Initial sweet orange and tangerine note transitions smoothly into blood orange and ruby red grapefruit towards the mid- and back-palate, with a lingering citric and lightly earthy bitterness.
Medium-bodied with prickly carbonation, lush and slick.
Amazingly smooth, amazingly drinkable. Absolutely top-notch. Once again, huge thanks to MattOC for giving me this growler. 1,114 charactersLjudsignal, May 05, 2014

Kinda orange colored? It was getting dark out. Smells like being teabagged by a hop monster. Or motor boating a hop goddess. I prefer that latter but the former seems to convey more "up in it" which is what I'm going for. Dank, dank, dank orange citrus aroma with an accompanying verdant leafy greenness. Tastes like it smells, I'm guessing that Julius is short for Orange Julius. Thick, heavy body laden with hop oil.
We did a comparison with Heady Topper and Julius emerged the victor if that says anything. 534 charactersdonkeyrunner, May 05, 2014

Poured from growler into Hill Farmstead tulip glass. Beautiful deep orange/amber color. Fluffy, white, inch-thick head which quickly dissipated, leaving white collar and LOTS of sticky lacing throughout. Zillions of very tiny bubbles. Nose is danky tangerine & mango citrus with hint of piney resin. On the palate, orange/mango & papaya/pineapple combos compete, as malt emerges. Alcohol is there, but barely detectable and well-masked by balanced by other goings-on. Mouthfeel is full, warm, ample, cozy, and inviting. Carbonation is subtle, but appropriate. All in all, a very favorable impression, even though the growler was 11 days old. I can't even begin to imagine how incredible this might be fresh from a tap. I hope to find out some day. Until then, add me to the long list of admirers at the altar of Julius. 917 charactersJohnParadee, Apr 15, 2014

Julius is better. This is certainly on the short list of great IPA's that I've had. Certainly on the East Coast. It's a bigger hop punch than Maine's Lunch shoots for, and is right there with Flower Power in the "regular IPA" group.
On top of that, the folks at the brewery couldn't be nicer and are both excited and laid back with the goings-on at the Treehouse. The location is very cool, and I hope this crew keeps making Treehouse ales for a long long time. 678 charactersmrz200, Mar 31, 2014

Poured from a 750ml swingtop growler.
Looks quite nice with an orange-gold body, quite hazy and some drooping lace. Melon, mango and orange are predominant in the aroma. Flavor is very creamy, green hops, bitter but not too much, lush mango and tropical fruit, fleshy orange. Not an in your face IPA but has marked fruit flavors which make it delicious. 435 characterspapat444, Mar 24, 2014

4.5/5  rDev -3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I'm a bit torn in reviewing Julius after my second growler in two weeks: the first sample was everything I had imagined after the stellar reviews and ratings, but the second sample was like I was drinking a different beer (confirmed by the sender, a huge Julius fan).
Rather than try to describe both samples, I'll stick with the first batch and temper the ratings between the two samples.
Cloudy orange/yellow, just what I look for in an unfiltered IPA: even through the brown glass swing top growler, you can see the delightful cloudiness. A frothy one finger head reduces within a minute or two leaving splotchy lacing in the tulip.
Explosions of ripe tropical fruit assault your nostrils, maybe the nicest aroma of any single IPA I have sampled so far. Ripe mango, passion fruit, and nectarine are prominent, making your mouth water for the first sip.
The exceptional nose translates to the juiciest tropical fruit experience imaginable. Alcohol is so well hidden behind the mango blast, it is almost as if you are drinking carbonated juice with a delightful hop tang. Bitterness is moderate and long lasting, such a great beer to savor!
Mouthfeel is a nice medium, dry finish, carbonation just right.
When the second sample arrived, a peek through the growler revealed a non cloudy liquid, and the "mojo" simply was not there, though a nice smelling and tasting beer.
I would rate the first batch as a 4.90 and the second as a 4.10
Word is Julius is supposed to be canned soon: I hope that Tree House will be able to deliver a higher level of consistency than what I have experienced in my two samples. Higher volume production usually results in a lower quality product, it will be interesting to see what happens here. I would love nothing more than Tree House to be able to produce in cans what I experienced on my first sip of Julius: beer nirvana! 1,864 charactersHendry, Mar 16, 2014

4.17/5  rDev -10.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Growler shared by drewone - Thanks.
A: Pours a hazy light-orange with an initial quarter-inch thick white head which fades to the rim leaving splotchy lace. (Possibly being biased here with the score due to a growler pour - but that is how it is).
N: Really nice tangerine, orange, and grapefruit present inside the zest. Tropical fruits also in the mix (passion). Floral and fruity. Really nice.
T: Balanced malts and hops. An enjoyable soapy-like quality with the up-front citrus.
M: Moderate body and barely medium carbonation (growler, yes). Not overly bitter or dry finish.
O: Nice with the best being the aroma. Interesting how a lot of east coasters seem to score this high. Not a west coaster style, but still a treat. 731 characterswethorseblanket, Nov 30, 2013

Pours a murky orange with a foamy tan head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, citrus zest, and herbal hop aromas. Taste is much the same with earthy, herbal hop flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that has a slightly better hop presence in the flavor in my opinion. 592 charactersUCLABrewN84, Oct 28, 2013

Received this in a growler and poured into a tulip glass.
This was bottled 10/12/13. Approximately 1 week old.
Nice floral citrus scent, pours hazy orangeish color. Nice clean ipa, very refreshing and citrusy. This beer is awesome! 
I wish I had access to this on a regular basis, it's one of those beers I can drink often and not get tired of it!
I highly recommend this one! 421 charactersfrizzzle, Oct 19, 2013

A: Hazy pale orange body under an inch of softly frothy off-white head that settles into a ring and leaves delicate rings of lace. Quite nice.
S: Nothing but hops, with emphasis on tropical fruitiness - mango, papaya, lychee and grapefruit. Some pine and spruce resin as well. Complex and excellent.
T: Grapefruit and mango up front, with pine and floral notes behind. It's delicious, but a mix of extreme resinous bitterness and faint malt stickiness make for a rather heavy finish. Extremely flavorful, extremely tasty, but a little unbalanced.
M: Smooth, lightly-carbonated medium body. Excellent.
O: Terrific beer, and rightly acclaimed. I'm a little put off by the heaviness of the finish, but too much flavor is a wonderful problem for an IPA to have. Really happy it happened to be on tap during my first visit to the brewery.
Cheers! 909 characterswoosterbill, Oct 13, 2013

Huge, sticky, lip-smacking hop flavor with loads of sweet ruby red grapefruit, pine sap, tangerine, and miscellaneous tropical fruits. Medium bodied and bitter, but very smooth and obviously supremely drinkable. Gloriously hoppy and one of the finest beers I had on my vacation home to New England. 492 characterswedge, Sep 26, 2013

A: Beautiful golden orange haze with a billowing white head.
S: Big citrus notes and a significant dose of pine that I wasn't expecting. A bit of tropical fruit but just tons of citrus and grassy, dank notes. Big, juicy, floral, resinous, citrus bomb.
T: Like the nose, huge citrus notes and a ton of pine dankness. Residual sweetness on the back end. Bitter, aggressive and in your face, but refreshing.
M: Absolutely spectacular. The best part of this beer. Soft, creamy and unctuous. I have never had a softer, more cloud-like mouthfeel on a beer that wasn't made by Hill Farmstead. Insane.
O: Simply excellent. I came in as a doubter, but Julius won me over. I ended up having three pints of it. A must-try. 795 charactersvonnegut21, Sep 16, 2013

A: Pours a hazy orange color with a one finger height of white foam forming on the pour. It recedes to a thin film that leaves sticky sheets of lace down the glass.
S: So juicy and vibrant. Fruity mango, pineapple and orange. Floral notes with a sweet bread malt body. Grassy with a mild citrus pith.
T: Really follows the nose. The mango is a little more juicy with accenting pineapple, pear and orange citrus. Sweet floral notes with a little bitterness from the light grassy notes. Minimal malt sweetness on the backend.
M: This is wonderful. Super light with just a little prickle from the carbonation. Sweet, fruity and floral on the finish. The drinkability is out of this world.
O: Absolutely crushable. I could drink growler upon grolwer of this stuff. Perfectly balanced with nod given to the hops to come to the forefront. 917 charactersTreebs, Sep 13, 2013

Aromas of grapefruit tart and sweet, pineapple, pine and resin hops characteristics, subtle bready backbone, lemon zest and orange peel. Flavors of grapefruit and passion fruit on the forward tongue, with a mango/pineapple sweet follow, a subtle sweetbread backbone, and then a slow build of pine pitch, resiny hops profiles, and a touch of roasted characteristics. The roast helps to cut the building bitter and robust characteristics, keeping the beer very drinkable. Robust, smooth brew with a tart, drying finish. The aftertaste is a heavy blend of tropical fruits, with a grassy, piney undertone. Very robust brew, yet extremely drinkable. Great flavors, and worth the trip to the brewery! 895 charactersGarthDanielson, Aug 24, 2013

A: Pours a stunning orangey-yellow color with a finger or so of white sudsy foam. What a beauteous looking beer.
S: The aroma of mango, peach and pine invade my nose with the smell of awesomeness. There's a slight malt undertone that I also pick up. I'm going to be in for a treat here!
T: The taste follows the nose as well as it can. Mango and peach just flood my taste buds. There is a pine flavor that rounds out the hop profile. There is a considerable amount of malt action going on here as well. There is a lack of bitterness and it makes this beer extremely pleasant. I'm already on my second 750 mL growler of this tonight and still no bitterness.
M: A medium bodied brew that dries out the mouth in a subtle way. There is a good carbonation level that allows me to not chug this beer, which is ultimately a good thing. The 6.8% ABV is non existent, which is also a plus. 
Overall: This is definitely the best IPA I've ever had. The tropical flavors that emits from this beer are like nothing I've ever experienced. It's not a punch you in the face IPA, but rather a balanced treat. Also, the fact that I cannot taste a hint of alcohol means that I could drink this for as long as I want to (assuming that I had an unlimited amount of this.) Tree House has themselves a true winner on their hands. What an incredible beer and experience. Wow! 1,468 charactersRichD, Aug 19, 2013

Pours a murky brownish amber with a 1/4 inch of head. Lots of lacing. The aroma is a big whiff of tropical fruits. Pineapple, peach, mango and citrus hops. Smells fantastic. The taste is a lot like the aroma. Big pineapple and peach flavor. Bitter mango with hints of floral hops. I'm surprised this one is only 6.8% because it seems to have a bigger alcohol presence. However it works perfectly with the tropical fruits and is still insanely drinkable. Bitter orange peel at the finish. Heavy, oily mouthfeel. Fruity, bitter and hoppy. Great IPA.

Appearance: Pours a medium amber and leaves a nice two-finger, pretty dense off-white head that hangs around for a while. Lacing covers the glass and remains as I swish the beer in the glass.
Smell: Delicious tropical citrus upfront, peaches, mango, grapefruit. The aroma really jumps out at me in a wonderful way.
Taste: Again peach, mango, grapefruit and citrus. This is like a delicious hopfruit juice. Finishes with a nice malt backbone. 
Mouth-feel: Very smooth, light to medium body with a low to medium carbonation. Very similar to a juice or a cask beer. 
Overall: A wonderful fruit-flavor-forward hoppy beer. Extreme drinkability and extremely refreshing. Very impressive IPA. 777 charactersResuin, Jul 26, 2013

4.44/5  rDev -4.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to BColton1 for being a great growler mule. Served in a standard pint. Pours a dull golden orange with a slight haze to the clarity and a dense, rocky, two-inch, cream-colored head. Head eventually settles into a consistent 1/8th inch cap with textured, semi-concentric bands of lacing revealed as the brew recedes. Nose expresses citrus, a slight piney aroma and a hint of tropical fruit. Taste consistent with nose; however, there is also an herbal character, but not overly bitter, a light toasted malt quality and a hint of spice. Great mouthfeel on this beer - medium-light in body with a creamy texture (almost reminds me of a cask offering) and a trace of oiliness. Overall - these guys are killing it. Julius is top notch - not a bitter hop bomb, but a complex and extremely drinkable American IPA. 813 charactersJwale73, Jun 26, 2013

Most important thing to note is how unique this beer is. I've never tasted a brew with this much citrus flavor coming straight from the hops and not from adding juice or lemonade on the back end. Great to sip and enjoy, but refreshing enough to handle a lot at one time. 
Highly suggested! 414 charactersmattparentned, Jun 05, 2013

S-Exactly what I want from the nose. Aromatic, ripe, exotic and juicy. Melon, citrus, pineapple. Love the wild yet structured hoppiness. A bouquet of hoppiness. A sweet, doughy maltiness rounds it out.
T-First I must comment in the beer's finish. After the initial flavors astound the taste buds, Julius finishes with an awesome, hoppy flavor that seems to be completely separate from the beginning. Every other aspect of the flavor is excellent as well. Freshly squeezed fruit juice hoppiness everywhere. Mango, abundant grapefruit, pineapple...everything I look for.
M-Very drinkable. The bitterness complements the hoppy flavors perfectly. Mellow carbonation. Juicy.
O/D-Finally got to try this. This one was very high on my hit list. Julius did not disappoint. Its just how I want my IPA to taste. The brewers are cool people too. Delicious beer.
----8/9/14
Finally got a full growler of this awesome elixir. It has the most unique, tangy hoppiness that is almost like bubblegum at some points. I absolutely love this beer.
---10/11/15
Can. The reason why I love this one so much is because it has the most unique hop flavor. It reminds me of PseudoSue from Toppling Goliath in that sense. I swear it almost has a bit of a watermelon hop taste. Brilliant. 1,373 charactersVelvetExtract, Jun 03, 2013

Smell is what you expect out of citra, but clean and pure fruit.
Taste is big citrus , hint of sweet malt. Definitely more sweetness to this than most ipas.
Feel is silky, a bit sweet and not very bitter. Huge flavors but very easy drinking.
Very very good beer, I'd advise against drinking it less than a week old, I've experienced some big bubblegum flavors if too fresh, they dominate to the point where you can't taste anything else. 556 characterstrevorpost, Jun 01, 2013

Pours out of the 750ml bottle with about an inch worth of head that reduces to a thin covering and leaves a thin layer of lacing on the glass. Poured into a Tree House tulip glass. The glass is very much worth the purchase by the way.
S - Can't imagine better. I love the fresh hop smell. I honestly compare it to Heady Topper.
T - A direct path fromthe smell. Wonderful fresh hops that remain fresh and do not change throught the experience. Fresh, day-old hops. Grapefruit is the first of the citrusy elements that comes to mind, but I can't pick out the individual flavors.
M - Velvet. A true pleasure to drink.
O - I ranked it a 4.5 but it could go higher. It's more than worth the initial investment of (well crafted) Tree House bottles and the cost of the fill - along with the drive from Boston. I have a 2 Litre in the fridge for a Memorial Day party and I'm tempted to dive into it right away. 959 charactersAndrew041180, May 25, 2013

A - White foam settles to a near-complete cap, thick collar, and leaves behind plenty of splotchy lacework. Hazed orange body.
S - Reminds me a lot of Zombie Dust actually, but with a tad more sugary malt sweetness. Massive citrus, light dankness and onion in the periphery.
T - The taste is quite similar, with loads of citrus, light tropical melon and mango, and some balancing brown sugar malts. Very low bitterness, as one would expect from a Citra-heavy brew.
M - Soft, growler-style carbonation. Medium body, no alcohol presence, and a dry, crisp finish. 
D - A great brew that is supremely drinkable. A tiny bit sweeter than I prefer, but on the whole pretty excellent stuff. Would happily drink this again any time. The growler emptied in record time and I may have to ask Greg for a full 64oz next time he heads to Tree House. 920 charactersMasterSki, Apr 17, 2013

A: Murky and hazy on the pour, like swamp water. Orange with tinges of ruby red. An inch and a half of white head settles shortly. Spotty lacing. This looks like something that came out of a juicer. Not the most appealing beer to behold. 
S: Dank and tropical on the nose. Lots of mango puree, pineapple, peach, apricot, mandarin orange, grapefruit. Hemp and dank hop oils. Herbal and a touch oniony. Faint whiffs of a grainy malt base.
T: Fresh and bold hop flavors. Burst of mandarin orange, blood orange, and mango. Pineapple, apricot, peach, white grapefruit et al. Hemp seed. Pine resin. Firm and even level of bitterness throughout. Background taste of tropical esters and a hint of peppery alcohol. Malt base is barely perceptible, just faint whispers of caramel, bread, and grain. One last explosion of fresh citrus fruits and leafy bitter herbs toward the end rides it out into a lingering finish. 
M: Medium body. The texture is creamy and slightly chewy, creating a little more substance, heft, and fullness in the mouth. Slight prickling carbonation. 
O: So it looks like something that came out of a juicer. It won't win any awards based on its appearance. It also tastes like something that came out of a juicer, but in this case that's a good thing. This is extremely vibrant and fresh-tasting straight from the source. Comparisons have been made between Treehouse beers and the brews that Hill Farmstead creates. I would say that's fair. Both breweries make beers that have that hand-crafted rough around the edges feel, but with a freshness and 'pop' that really satisfies. If you find yourself in the area, it is absolutely worth the trek to this remote brewery. 1,761 charactersryan1788a5, Apr 06, 2013

S: Great powerful nose on this one. Tropical fruits and pine are present. Nose changes as beer warms. 
T: Delicious! Tropical fruits up front. Juicy Mango, papaya and more in the front of your mouth. Pine in the back leads to a great bitter finish that lingers. 
M: light carbonation with a full body feel that leaves a delicious coating in the mouth.

A: Unfiltered cloudy orange color. Full finger of slightly off white head. Sticking round and leaving some nice lacing.
S: Fruit bomb on the nose! Big apricot, mango, papaya, and some pineapple. Some sweet malts are in there behind all the hops. Some pine like spice.
T: Nice bitter hops up front. Assault on the tip of the tongue of piney flavors that moves into the mid-palate and hangs out. Those are nice reisinous juicy flavors that you had the nose of as well. Finish is dry and there is some lingering pine notes. Almost puckers the mouth.
M: Medium bodied. Good mouth coating of hops. 637 charactersinlimbo77, Mar 25, 2013

The body sits a bright orange color with a cloudy appearance. A firm two finger off-white cap rose and fell slowly, leaving some sheeting lace covering the glass.
Bright oranges, grapefruit, tangerines, and tropical fruit--mangoes and pineapples, primarily. The fruits leap out of the glass. Some lightly toasted malt provide a firm foundation.
Sweet, juicy tropical and citrus fruits coat the palate. Waves of mangoes, pineapple, grapefruit, oranges, and tangerines. A blanket of malt hangs in the back. A very mild bitterness comes in late and lingers for a little while. The focus her is more on the juicy, sweet fruit and not the bitterness.
Smooth, medium body with a mild lingering bitterness that is counterbalanced by the big sweet fruit notes.
A very nice IPA in all aspects. I would prefer more bitterness to really fall in love, but that would be splitting hairs. This is a very nice beer. 944 charactersColForbinBC, Mar 11, 2013

Bottled on 02-23-13
Served in a pint glass
Super cloudy in appearance. This IPA beats even the hoppy Hill Farmstead beers in term of turbidity. The orangey, peachy, straw colored liquid was topped by a one-plus finger tall crop of soapy, eggshell tinged foam. The head fell rather quickly to a clingy ring of froth. Large drippy blocks of lacing cascaded down the top third of the glass.
The nose was perhaps the best ever I have experienced in an IPA. Incredibly fragrant and bright with intense fruity notes. Tons of peach, nectarine and apricot. Lots of tropical fruits as well. Mango and papaya were apparent. Good amount of orange peel. Quite sweet overall. The sweetness however seemed to come from the plethora of fruity C-hop notes rather than from a stiff malty backbone. Dank, resiny hops appeared as well.
The flavor profile was also remarkably impressive. Super strong peach, apricot and nectarine notes led things off. Lots of tangerine and candied orange peel as well. Semi-sweet pale malts were noticeable on the front end, but they were merely there for balance. Intense tropical fruit notes. Mango and pineapple were most apparent. The finish was dry, pithy and semi-bitter and contained strong white grapefruit notes.
The beer was medium bodied. Soft, creamy and pillowy with a fine, mellow carbonation. The first growler I had (which was consumed on the same day it was bottled) had a zippier effervescence to it, but I actually preferred the subtler mouthfeel on the three-day-old growler.
Julius is one of the best IPA I have ever had the pleasure of drinking. Many people have compared Tree House Brewing to Hill Farmstead and for good reason. Both are located in bucolic setting and both produce some outstanding IPAs (along with other beers). Needless to say, I am extremely glad to have these guys located in state. 1,950 charactersDamian, Feb 27, 2013

A - Unfiltered IPA porn. This beer pours a gorgeous hazy peach/orange body. Super hazy and holding it up to the light just illuminates that perfect color. Three fingers of an off-white head with sticky lacing and long lasting retention. Thick edging sticks around the whole time. I can't imagine a beer looking any better than this.
S - I had a few pours of this earlier and saved half of it to properly review later. When I reopened the growler I got a release of carbonation and with it a blast of rich and sweet tropical notes. In the glass I get layers of bitter grapefruit, sweet yet under ripe peaches, mango, and a faint touch of biscuits.
T - A rather unique hop profile that really makes itself stand out from other IPA's. Bitter grapefruit lead into super sweet concentrated peach juice. Its almost tropical, but the level of sweetness really points toward a peach or apricot for me. Finishes with a touch of clean crackers and a quick hit of bitterness. It starts off being very concentrated, juicy, and sweet but it quickly transitions into a very clean and refreshing finish.
M - Medium bodied with a nice level of carbonation. The level of bitterness is just perfect here, quick and intense but fades away pleasantly. Crazy drinkable.
O - For a beer that is being brewed out of a shed in a guys front yard in Central Massachusetts...this is just fucking phenomenal stuff. Totally impressed and left wishing I had purchased many, many more growlers of this. The next Hill Farmstead? Probably not. But I am very lucky to have this place so close to me. 1,729 charactersdavey101, Feb 17, 2013

4.62/5  rDev -0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Oh yeah! Just filled at the brewery about 2 hours ago... it's fantastic, can't wait to down this growler!
Gently pouring from the growler that's filled all the way to the tippety top, forms a film of liquid gold streaming between the sides of the glass and the main spout of liquid, when it finishes pouring a big frothy 1.5 finger head is left in the aftermath (excuse my pun), that sticks around for a while and leaves lots of soapy lacing like head exploded in the glass. The beer itself is semi hazy, with a nice golden light streaming through the reddish orange peach honey colored beer.
Nose is phenomenal! the bursting bright bodacious tropical fruits fill my nostrils and dance in the receptors, tangerine, light citrusy clementine, a bit of grapefruit and a little passion fruit all waft out in a big tropical fruit blend. A light wave of resin and floral hops come out next with just a bit of a malty base to prop it up. The more I nose, the more the huge wafts of pure grapefruit come out, it's like breaking the little juice packets on a fresh grapefruit. After a while I could practically confuse this for grapefruit juice.
My taste buds await their fate as they prepare for the awesomeness coming out of the glass. First wave of the beer actually brings a light sweet malty base that paves the way for the hops following quickly after. It doesn't take long for fresh grapefruit to rush in. Citrus and tropical fruit just entwine their juiciness with each cell of my tongue and saturate the deliciousness part of my tongue. Between waves of fresh squeezed grapefruit comes light tangerine, passion fruit, papaya, mango, tropical fruit you name it! Hint of a fresh hop resin and pure Citra awesomeness, maybe a little Simcoe, Summit, or Galaxy... it has those delicious profiles. Light bitter rind flavor coming from the mountain of grapefuit, some bitterness but not very bitter initially. I could drink gallons of this without feeling it. Finish is drier but juicy, again tons of grapefruit juice, fresh squeezed just lingering for a long time, like it doesn't want to part with my tongue and my taste buds sure don't want to part with it! A light bitter rind flavor lingering with more tropical fruit flavors, and a little mango and hint resin.
Mouth is med bodied, soft and fluffy at the same time with nice carb, and just a hint of hop oil resin.
Overall, heeelll yeah! Near perfect aroma, super delicious, very drinkable, etc. It's like a lesser boozy, lesser bitter, and lesser resinous version of most of the big Citra Hill farmstead beers, especially SS4 coming to mind, except I only have to drive a few minutes rather than few hours to get it! I can't wait until they expand and I can get a lot more of this growler of pure delicious zen! 2,766 charactersjlindros, Nov 24, 2012
4.87/5  rDev +5%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 5Picked up a fresh growler from the Tree House brewery. Split a growler with my wife, she had half in a Tree House Tulip, I'm reviewing from a Tree House goblet (only a few left, go get one!).
Appearance - cloudy, straw-like orange beer poured a one finger foamy head that quickly dissipated. A nice creamy halo lingered throughout the session. Minimal lacing was apparent on the glass.
Smell - holy citrus Batman! Bitter citrus, like rind as Rudzud mentioned is at the forefront of the nose. Behind the citrus is a glorious hop scent. Easily my favorite smelling IPA.
Taste - Citrus. Oranges. Lots of oranges. Rind and zest. Ok, after the citrus explosion is a hoppy IPA taste I crave no matter the time of year, time of day, whatever. All day, to the face. 
Mouthfeel - crisp yet smooth - perfectly carbonated. Drink this one fresh and you'll see what I mean.
Overall, one of my favorite beers ever. Light, sessionable, tasty and a hop and citrus explosion. It comes on tap every so often at the Cedar Street Grill in Sturbridge, that's currently the only place to get it on tap so if you're there and you see it, you know what to do.
I gave the growler to Rudzud as a birthday gift and told him "This holds up to Hill's Citra." Yes, Rudzud, he of the almost 1,000 reviews. Read his review and you'll see I'm not lying. Enough said. 1,339 charactersbpk59, Nov 13, 2012
4.76/5  rDev +2.6%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Received as a birthday gift from BPK59 and poured into a tulip. Guess these guys only do growler fills on Saturdays. Secret recipe for this one I guess. Have a pretty good idea on the hop they used though.
A - Pours a hazy dark, kinda grayish, orange with a nice two finger head that faded somewhat quickly to leave some light side lacing and a thin cloud/halo. I chuckled when I poured it as the colour resembled that of Filmishmish. Could this be another ugly duckling type beer?
S - Aaaaand upon smelling it my initial thoughts are realized. An ugly duckling indeed!Mother of mercy...EXPLOSION of citrus rind. Orange, tangello, clementine, and tangerines. No malts, not getting any bready yeasts. Just pure, unadulterated hops. Holy fuck!
T - Uhh, yah. Where did this come from huh? So, like the nose it is an explosion of oranges and tangerines. Lots and lots of hop oils here, delicious hops. So much great orange and citrus notes. Super, super faint bubblegum buried in the citrus. Really cant convey just how well the citrus pops here. 
M - Mouthfeel is very, very nice here. Solid carbonation, super sessionable with a lingering bitter citrus peel aftertaste.
O - Summit? Galaxy? I dont know, just as long as I can get this beer more often. So, this is good. This is very, very good. This is almost like a poor mans Hill Farmstead IPA, in that you don't have to drive 8 total damn hours for some. This IPA is, in my opinion, completely on par with a Shaun Hill IPA, minus the appearance. The nose, the flavours, out standing. Mind = blown 1,551 charactersrudzud, Nov 12, 2012

4.39/5  rDev -5.4%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5750ml THB swing-top bottle filled at the brewery. 
First THB glass pours with a 1/2" beige head, over the totally cloudy orangey amber brew. Head is promptly down to an uneven skim, with slow-falling coating lace. Aroma is pungent oranges and tangerines. Wow. 
Taste starts fruity sweet, tangerines in the middle, and then a orange zest bitter in the close. Mouthfeel is soft and smooth, and drinkability is excellent. Nice one. 430 charactersppoitras, Oct 27, 2012
