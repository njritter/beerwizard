4.52/5  rDev -1.3%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Pours black with only a tiny ring of fizz rising to the top even after an aggressive pour straight into the glass. The tiny bit of fizz doesn't retain long, nor is there any lacing left behind. Aroma is jam packed with notes - bourbon, oak, coffee, molasses, caramel, and roasted malts. Quite the aromatic quality to this beer. It's loud, with the bourbon note being just shy of a boozy. Flavor profile is massive. Absolutely massive. Big, smooth bourbon notes hit first and linger throughout the flavor profile. Rich caramel, toffee, molasses, milk chocolate, and coffee provide a barrage of flavors, and yet don't step on the toes of each other. Bourbon is present, and while it nears a fleshy, and boozy quality, it manages to remain within balance. Mouth feel is thick, filling, velvety, and creamy. Overall, for those seeking bourbon and coffee in a thick, heavy presence - this is your beer. Despite the complexity of this beer in both the aroma and flavor profile, every note is struck well and given a full beat to ring out.

Smell is like you've poured a glass of bourbon while sitting in an aromatic coffee bar, while chocolate and vanilla waft over  from the bakery section.  (Sorry, that was a terrible way of putting it but you get the idea:  the smell is fantastic.). Taste more or less follows, but the coffee is especially dominant, the chocolate and vanilla less so, the bourbon somewhat (to me pleasantly) subdued or at least moderate.  Mouthfeel is, as everyone notes thick and chewy.  Great beer, so glad I could have one.  I'd snag another if I saw one, even at the high price. 676 charactersprofessorchow, Mar 13, 2017

But when it's good, damn, is it good.  Coffee was smooth and subdued, and the fudgy, chocolatey malt flavors go well with the thick, chewy texture.  Lacks the fruity depth of the regular BCBS, but as a whole different beast, it fits the bill deliciously well. 343 charactersjmasher85, Mar 02, 2017

2016 in a Teku Glass
L - Pours a dark dark brown.  Opaque in the glass.  Kind of fizzy with no head
S - Deep notes of chocolate, bourbon, coffee, toffee, and vanilla
T - The taste is coffee, lots of chocolaty fudge, with a bitter sweetness on the finish. There is a bit of roast char in the middle.  I find it ever so slightly more robust than BCBS.
F - very thick and chewy almost sticky.
O - Tons of flavor.  I find it more well rounded than BCBS. Maybe a little less alcohol bite. 503 charactersbrewaddict, Feb 17, 2017

3.99/5  rDev -12.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Found this at amy local bottle shop and just had to pick it up since I had never tried it before.  I've loved getting the straight up BCBS, so I figured I needed to try this one as well in order to round out the 2015 releases.  This beer pours a pitch black hue that is opaque with just a slight bit of carbonation visible around the edges.  The head is dark khaki and frothy, dissipating slowly to a ghost thin layer of lacing that is retained.  4.5/5  The aroma is quite strong and boozy, but it features some very sweet notes as well.  Notes of toffee, espresso, dark chocolate, and char really dominate with slight undertones of tobacco and leather.  The espresso/coffee is easily noticeable and is quite strong.  4.25/5  The flavor is quite boozy and bitter.  I would recommend letting this one warm up to room temp first before opening it since warmer temps seem to kill off the bite.  Toffee and espresso jump out right away before a light undertone of dark chocolate comes in to round off the dark roasted/slightly sweet beginning.  The char, tobacco, and leather seem to come out more in the middle with a bourbon caramel note leading the way in the final third.  The finish is quite bitter and boozy with the abv really showing itself.  3.75/5  A slight carbonation tickle hits the tongue right away before a light dryness rears its head and pushes through all the way to the finish, which sees the dryness lingering for quite some time on the palate.  This is easily a full bodied beer that does not drink quite as heavy as many stouts that I have had, but it is still very heavy.  4/5  Very good barrel aged coffee stout here, but the booziness and bite really throw me off.  I thought that the coffee might drown out some of the booziness but I was wrong.  It's still there in all its glory.  Like I said in the taste section above, let this one warm up to room temp before opening.  Doing so helps to cut the bite of the booze.  4/5 1,946 charactersbwood06, Jan 22, 2017

Smells of coffee, chocolate, and a bit of bourbon. 
Could be me, but I was expecting more coffee on the tongue. Lots of chocolate, a bit of sweet bourbon, no burn. 
The mouthfeel is what really sets this apart from so many other BA stouts. Thick and viscous, if you can chug a beer like this then you're likely one of those insane professional eaters that puts down 50 hotdogs at Nathan's Famous every 4th of July. I'm about an hour into drinking this thing and I'm only halfway through it simply do to the thickness of the liquid.
Overall, it's a great beer, and I'm quite happy to have found a bottle, but I'm not sure it's worth the trade value that a lot of people give it. It's mass produced, but eclipsed by a few other coffee stouts, and some non-BA stouts like Abraxas. That isn't to say that I would pass it up if a bottle shop offered it to me, simply that I wouldn't give up a valuable piece from my cellar for a bottle like a few people have done. 1,067 charactersAngerhaus, Jan 22, 2017

The beer is pitch black with almost no head on it. A small amount of tan lacing gets left on the glass throughout.
Lots to love regarding the smell of this beer. Dark roasted coffee, dark chocolate, molasses, finished off with a hint of bourbon.
The taste follows right where the nose left off. TONS of coffee flavor up front, followed by chocolate, and a very smooth bourbon bite on the end. Perfectly balanced beer!
This beer has a thick mouth feel - chewy, sticky, almost candy-like on your lips. 
Overall, fantastic is all I can say! Definitely my favorite variant of Bourbon County and I can't wait to see how these bottles will mature over time, not that it needs to improve at all! 729 charactersJangoon24, Jan 19, 2017

2016 Edition
Look is typical bourbon county. The only difference hear is absolutley no head. Beer is pitch black, pours like motor oil.
Smell is coffee, bourbon, mollases, booze, dried currant. Really nice.
Taste is dark chocolate, vanilla, coffee, oak, bourbon, dried fruits. Nice roasty flavor on the back end. A real nice tasting beer to say the least.
Feel is velvety, chewy, thick. Leave a stickiness on your lips. Again really nice.
Overall bourbon county rarely disappoints. I'm usually not one to jump on the InBev bandwagon but this is always one set of beers that will rarely let one down. 676 charactersMerryTapster, Jan 19, 2017

At first there were strong nose of coffee but it soon weened off into straight bourbon. Taste was of a common bourbon barrel, nothing special to it. I will be honest and say that I was disappointed in this beer. 320 charactersbeyondthepalace, Jan 03, 2017

Taste is surprising light on the bourbon and is a nice balance with the coffee.  Feel is on par with what a barrel aged stout should be, definitely not too thin.  I cannot say it is heads and shoulders above other BA coffee stouts I have had, but is an excellent offering from Goose Island. 355 charactersnovamat, Dec 31, 2016

Rich roasted coffee, smooth vanilla & bourbon heat in the nose. 
Medium thick, sticky mouthfeel. 
Rich roasted coffee, mocha syrup & faint vanilla flavors; booze heat emerges as this warms. Another month or two would likely help this, as the heat & the coffee notes don't meld perfectly, but it's still damn good. 485 charactersGuyFawkes, Dec 23, 2016

L- Dark brown with a slight reddish tinge around the edges. About a finger of mocha colored head that fades almost instantly. 
S- Lots of coffee. A bit of bittersweet chocolate and bourbon in the background. Very nice. 
T- Coffee is very prominent. Notes of caramel, chocolate, bourbon. Smooth, nicely balanced. 
F- The one slight disappointment. Pours pretty thin. However, it has a decent richness on the palette. Fairly high carbonation.

4.96/5  rDev +8.3%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 52016 bottle drank fresh and poured in to a tulip snifter. Pours a tad thin and carbonated heavily from an aggressive pour but almost immediately dissipates leaving nothing behind. The smell is a coffee bomb upon first pour. The barrel is barely noticeable initially but starts to become more prevalent as it warms. The coffee starts to integrate in to the smell and the vanilla, boozy, and roasty notes of the barrel start to come to the forefront of the nose; deliciousness. The coffee variant is much more balanced than the regular which can be a bit cloying, especially this year. You still get the sweet caramel notes of the base beer on the front end but it is perfectly balanced by the bitterness and acidity of the coffee on the back end. The boozy flavor of the barrel as well as the vanilla notes also come through in the taste much like the smell.  It is thick and chewy like a barrel aged stout should be but it is a tad thin. It also has to sit for a bit to let the carbonation dissipate and the mouthfeel to become more coating and let the flavors develop. Overall this is the best of bourbon county's lineup (outside the variants which could be hit or miss). Perfect balance of big stout, barrel, and coffee to bind it all together. Only knock is it is a tad thin this year. 1,288 charactersAmguerra305, Nov 29, 2016

A - Pours very dark brown, small head that quickly disappears.
S - Aroma is strong and not coffee at all.  More dark fruit than anything else.
T - Had a couple sips then allowed to warm. Coffee flavor is not overwhelming, very well balanced with dark chocolate flavor.  Any alcohol that might have been noticeable when new has completely calmed down. 
M - Carbonation is low.  Mouth feel is almost perfect, beer coats the mouth and sticks.  Wow.
O - This is a wonderful beer.  Coffee doesn't hit you over the head, it's just part of the flavor profile, and I think I like that best.  Give me more! 628 charactersspacecake9, Nov 29, 2016

Appearance: Deep, dark, reddish brown with a slight froth of tan foam.
Smell: Roasted coffee atop grains and caramel and slight balsamic vinager.
Taste: Mildly infected, but still drinkable. Great roast coffee notes, molasses and dark barley against lactic tartness - both tasty, but not an ideal pairing.
Mouthfeel: Medium body and caebonation; light relative to its deep flavor.
Overall: Terrific roast coffee notes setup for a fantastic pairing, but infected tartness detracts from the otherwise toasty, boozy stout base. Still drinkable, just not all it could be. 666 charactersHipCzech, Nov 25, 2016

4.55/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.52013 Vintage. Bottle dated 11/15/13, purchased that Black Friday, and carefully aged for nearly 3 years.
Poured into Lawson's Finest Liquids tulip glass.
L: Almost no head on pour, whatever there was is gone in a flash. No lacing, only a thin ring around the edge. The beer is very dark and opaque even when held up to a light bulb. You can see tiny carbonation bubbles rising at the very top.
S: Nose is almost all coffee. I let it warm to see if something else would start coming through; some hints of unsweetened cocoa and vanilla start coming through as it warms. Maybe a tiny bit of the caramel malt as well.
So far it's well above-average, but I'm not absolutely overwhelmed or anything. Here goes...
T: Coffee, but far less assertive than you'd expect from the nose (an effect of aging?). Unsweetened cocoa, chocolate, caramel, vanilla. Malts of the base stout. The tiniest bit of alcohol heat on the finish, barely noticeable and well integrated into the entire taste. So yeah, this is pretty great.
F: Full-bodied, the tiniest bit of carbonation. Impeccable construction and balance, augmented by the mellowing of aging. ABV well-disguised, acid of coffee balanced with sweetness of base stout.
O: So, so, so got paid off for my patience on this. I did not try a new bottle of 2013, so I have nothing to compare it with, but I can sense some differences from the base stout in softening and integration of flavors.
This is simply fantastic. All praise to the brewer. 1,484 charactersIvoryFoxhole, Oct 17, 2016

4.34/5  rDev -5.2%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Pour is viscous motor oil with mini fizzy bubbles coating the surface clingingly as a half finger head, leaving walls of dark tan lace, fizzling out to a thin ring.
Fudge, brownie and a mocha coffee nose open things up quite promisingly. A nice oak presence adds some spice to the aroma, but it's not hot. Vanilla develops over time. 
At first gulp, I notice a smooth heat tickle the back of throat and tease the ears, but not burn. I'm tasting chocolate covered raisins, fudge, and oak. Roasted malt is pretty well integrated and is neither overpowering nor snuffed out. Salted roasted almonds pop in as it warms.
A fizzy tangy intro leads to a medium to full-bodied mouthfeel, with a slight drying effect to the roof of the mouth. 
While I've had small portions of this a few times here or there, this full review is based on a bottled 2013 Vintage enjoyed on 10/09/2016. 877 charactersSabtos, Oct 10, 2016

Look is as expected. Dark with a bit of a red hue. 
Smell has a hint of coffee followed strongly with watermelon and something repugnant.
Taste is a complete wrecking ball. A fully unbalanced sour that has me cussing.
Feel is immediate carbonation followed by the thinness where the sour lives.
If this were on tap I would try it again. For now, crying about the other bottle yet to be opened and putting myself through the torture again just to see if I got lucky. 538 characterseggsurplus, Jun 29, 2016

3.64/5  rDev -20.5%look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5No label information. Brewed in the style of an American Imperial Stout aged in Bourbon Barrels with coffee added. Available in 16.9 oz. (500 ml.) bottles, previously 12 oz. bottled 4 packs and on limited release draft. 2015 release.
Poured from a 16.9 oz. (500ml.) bottle to a snifter glass.
(Appearance) Pours a crisp, foamy head of a dark caramel tone over a very dark brown, near black body. Retention is below average and lacing is light and spotty. 3.75
(Smell) Earthy coffee bean atop a toasted bread, caramel syrups and moderately roasted barley with a soft underlying sweetness. Potency is moderate. 4
(Taste) Earthy roasted grains, coffee beans and caramel syrups with undertones of chocolate. There is a discernible acidity and tanginess lingering in the background, noticeable and does not generate an enjoyable impact on the overall flavor. Finishes slightly acidic, grainy, and tart. 3.5
(Mouthfeel) Texture is slick, medium oily, slightly chalky, medium dry. Carbonation is moderate, generating a medium frothiness and a medium crisp finish. Body is shy of medium for the style, shy of heavy overall. Balance is slightly tangy, acidic and earthy over sweet. Alcohol presence is mild and there is a distinctive impact from what suggests to be a potential bottle infection. 3.5
(Overall) I've sampled this beer on draft enough to know what it is an is not, and this bottle suffers from a clear infection, which is unfortunate considering the new repackaging job that makes it more expensive than ever. I'll consider revisiting this beer next year and hopefully these issues will be corrected. 3.5

4.12/5  rDev -10%look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.252013 vintage poured in 2016.
Pours rather flat with a moderate amount of carbonation. The smell of coffee is still strong. The coffee is still there as well in the taste.  Its presence masks the sweetness from the normal BCBS.  In its place is bitterness and a tinge if acidity from the coffee.  
I like my stouts with moderate amounts of coffee, if any at all. I was expecting something different based on the high reviews.  However, this is pretty much the same as all others I've had.  The base beer doesn't help much when there is simply so much coffee added and is overpowering.  If they tone down the amount of coffee added, I think this would be much better. 667 charactersnawpnawp, Jun 01, 2016

4.48/5  rDev -2.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Very glad I got one that wasn't infected!
Look: Pours with a nice, dark brown 1 finger head, dark as can be. No lacing is seen on the glass. 
Smell: Smells like coffee and bourbon! Smells less intense than the regular BCBS. 
Taste: a ton of roasted coffee up front with a blast of barrel and a ton of caramel on the backend. Less sweet than the regular but delicious in it's own right. 
Feel: Feels a bit thin compared to the regular but it feels very smooth and rich for a coffee stout. Definitely on the lighter side for a BA stout. 
Overall: This was a fantastic gamble. Bought this and 4 BW off a buddy for $30 and this makes it worth that price to me. He even threw in a Perennial Aria as an extra! I'm looking foward to cracking the barleywines in the near future and hoping for the best! 799 charactersTHSmusicman, May 29, 2016

Taste: Wow! So much vanilla and bourbon upfront middle of the mouth medium roast coffee milk chocolate maple syrup cherry burnt sugar finishes with a nice Carmel note dark chocolate coconut and a slight coffee roastiness.
Feel: big body syrupy sticky mouthfeel dry in the finish.
Overall: Just Wow! I love regular BCBS and this has a lot of the same characteristics but I think the coffee and the barrel character make this just absolutely incredible and just a little better then the regular version. But both versions deaserve a rating higher then 100!

For those that bought in quantity and don't go looking for the latest infected beer news, they might have not have had a chance to send theirs back for a refund or exchange. Pretty sad the very short time frame that Inbev allowed for this, especially when the bottle clearly says "condition up to 5 years". These beers are known to get better with age, and those of u who age them, their most loyal customers, 3 months just don't cut it for a fair time-frame to get their money back. 528 charactersdream, May 08, 2016

Taste delivers a massive dose of coffee with a healthy amount of bourbon, mild oak, tons of chocolate malt and two row.  Its a huge beer, but very enjoyable despite its heft.  There's vanilla in there too.  Very chewy, my favorite version of bourbon county.  Sucks I heard they had an infection this year, but I didn't even bother, so I haven't had a compromised one. 494 charactersrodbeermunch, Apr 16, 2016

poured a nice thick black with a one finger khaki head that lingered for a couple minutes.|
smell was sweet bourbon with some coffee and vanilla, burbon almost smelled fresh as if the taste was going to be warm from the burbon alcohol.
taste was savory thick burbon and roasted malts up front, mid taste the coffee hits adding in a chocolate like qaulity that finishes with a sweet bourbon  vanilla  that lingers, cant wait to try the 2012 I have as well. 528 characterslilreyreyatomic, Apr 15, 2016

Well, to my disappointment they were not. The beer had an overwhelmingly sour taste that completely dominated the beer and made it undrinkable. Imagine a berliner stout. No bourbon flavor at all due to the intense sour notes.. I had to drain pour the entire bottle after a few sips. Disappointed with how GI handled the situation as well, with the unclear deadline for refunds. I will not be standing in line next year, that's for sure. 559 charactersGW3, Apr 14, 2016

3.8/5  rDev -17%look: 3 | smell: 3 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 42010 bottle poured into my  imperial stout glass.
Appearance- from a hardy pour this thing comes out like motor oil .Black in color. little head that dissipates quickly. leaves no lacing. 
Smell- pure booze. booze and chocolate. not getting any coffee notes which is a bummer.
Taste-  from the look and smell I was worried I've wasted five years aging this brew but the taste is prolly the best thing about this beer. you do get a heavy alcohol smack at first but then the chocolate comes in to make you feel all better. the coffee is well hidden. alil disappointing being a coffee stout but it's there. you really have to taste for it. 
Mouthfeel- heavy bodied. like I said it was like pouring motor oil. carbonation is still holding on but another year or two it would be dead. really not too shabby for the age or style. 
Drinkability- I can knock down this bomber no prob. glad i'm not drinking another one tho. 
Overall- I wonder if this was fresher the coffee notes would be more pronounced but aged 5 years it's well hidden. still a good imperial coffee stout but for me I don't get the hype or would say this is something to queef over.  good sipper but to me not worth the hype nor price. I remember paying 6 or 7 bucks for this bomber pre-Budweiser sellout. 1,273 charactersclaminat420, Apr 07, 2016

Dark brown pour with a smaller head, some lacing.  The look is average compared to other Stouts but it makes up for it in taste.
Smells boozy with chocolate.  Roasted coffee and nutty and maybe a touch of vanilla. 
Tastes great, a touch boozy, but the bourbon barrel is nice. It's not over done at all.  
Mouth feel is medium bodied and smooth.  Surprising smooth with the bourbon barrel.
Overall it's very good.  Much easier to find now than previous years.  I think a lot of bourbon Stouts are catching up to BCBS, but still a very good beer and worth putting in your cellar.  Look forward to this one next year and seeing how it changes, 711 charactersJay_P22, Apr 03, 2016

Only got 1 bottle and debated whether or not to cellar.  I'm glad I opened it, as this would have been a huge letdown given the high expectations for BCBS.  Called and requested refund.
Did not have a gusher as some had reported but opened in the sink just in case.  The pour looks nice with a quarter finger tan head that dissipates almost completely in about 10 seconds.
The nose is still very good.  Vanilla, chocolate, and bourbon, although the coffee is subtle.
Unfortunately, the taste has got some very pronounced and inescapable sour notes, especially on the back end.  I feel I may have gotten luckier than some on the extent of the lacto infection, although I'm afraid it may still be a partial drain-pour.  I've been sipping on it for well over an hour and still have almost half the bottle left.
Overall, Goose Island gets some bonus points for offering refunds, but the bottled CoffeeStout and Barleywine should probably have never hit the market to begin with if any infection was suspected.  That being said, I will still probably go hunting for the 2016 batch. 1,131 charactersNatoMasochism, Feb 26, 2016

Black as all get out with almost no head. Smells pretty similar to regular bourbon county with the exception of mild coffee. Very rich. Coffee is faintly present, so I'm sure this was way better fresh. Even without all the coffee this was an excellent beer. 269 charactersLloydDobler, Feb 13, 2016

Strong coffee and chili pepper aroma with subtle bourbon character.
Bold, dark roast coffee and baking chocolate.  Sweet molasses and licorice.  Smooth bourbon tones.  Chili pepper spice.  Cough syrup aftertaste.
Heavy, syrupy feel and texture.  Low carbonation.
Good stuff. One of the better coffee stouts I've had. 374 charactersbnes09, Feb 13, 2016

Pours jet black just like regular Bcbs 
The smell is where the coffee differentiates itself from regular. The nose is outstanding. Still tons of coffee even after a year in the bottle. The first few minutes were overpowered by coffee in a good way. 
Taste follows the nose quite well. Tons of coffee flavor in the first half of the glass. As it warmed up, more of the dark fruit and molasses flavors you would expect from regular started coming through. If I could have done it over, I would have drank the whole thing cold while the coffee flavors still overpowered everything else. 
Mouthfeel is just what you would expect from and bcbs. Thick and chocolatey. 
Overall, one of the best beers I have had. Will be fighting the lines in years to come to score bottles of coffee 816 characterspbgnar, Feb 07, 2016

Higher carbonation on the pour, thinner body, and the taste was sour cherry and salt.  The head sizzled like a steak in a hot pan of oil. Had to drain pour it which was extremely disappointing. This has been a reoccurring problem with the 2015 BCBCS's and GI had to give refunds through February of 2016. I was able to call and get a refund check mailed to me. Hoping for better quality control next year.
2013 release, dated 11/15/13. Enjoyed 1-1/2 years later. Pours black with a medium sized dark brown head; some lacing. Smells strongly of bourbon, coffee, and rich cocoa. The taste follows exactly, but in waves of complexity; first the bourbon, then the coffee, then the cocoa, with an amazing bittersweet finish. The mouthfeel is smooth and the carbonation is medium for the style. Not all that different from the regular BCBS. Definitely a world-class beer. 964 charactersalarmclock314, Feb 04, 2016

L: Balck with a thin tan head. Head retention is good for the ABV. Alcohol lacing and bubbles sticking to the glass.
S: Could the glass but I'm not picking up much on this beer. Mostly I get a heavy booze smell, similar to smelling a spirit. Behind that, there is roast and coffee, but its mild. 
T: Bourbon, toffee, caramel, dark chocolate, marshmallow, and roasted malt; all things I get in normal BCBS. However, in the finish there is a mild roasted coffee which blends with the other flavors. Not over the top coffee, but it smooths the flavors well. No booze in the taste, but a nice warming alcohol feeling. As it warms, more chocolate and fudge comes out, along with some nuttiness.
F: Creamy and smooth, and sugary and sticky on the finish. This is a great sipping beer.
Overall, the look, taste, and feel of this beer on what I expect from Bourbon County, rich and decadent. The absence of aroma is somewhat of a mystery. 936 charactersMyThoughtsExactly, Jan 30, 2016

Smells rich of coffee and hints of bourbon. Impressive that the bourbon is so muted. Medium body and little carbonation, but starts to wake up as it warms. Nice balanced feel, minimal bitterness. 
Taste follows, just tons of coffee flavors, then some sweets - maybe some cocoa and vanilla - and then the bourbon closes the show. Goes down ridiculously smooth. 
Overall there's not much bad you can find here. As long as you know that it's a coffee stout, you will love this. 560 charactersGreatStoutman, Jan 23, 2016

A - Pours a dark black, mocha head dissipates quickly. No lacing.
S - Green coffee, not much else.
T - Bitter coffee, booze. Tart cherries? Salty? Something's off.
M - Medium body, almost thin. Wish it was more on the slick/viscous side.
O - Disappointing. For all the accolades and lofty rating, this not only did not live up, it was flat-out bad, pure and simple. There's an odd salinity to it, which clashes with the slight tart cherry finish, and tastes nothing like the base BCBS I had a few weeks ago. I can't imagine any of these undesirable characteristics were intended, but it doesn't change the fact that this was a terrible beer. It gets worse as the beer warms... 738 charactersmrandypandy, Jan 12, 2016

A - thick and black, no head
S - coffee, bourbon, vanilla, oak, roasted barley
T - sweet and rich with notes of roasted coffee, roasted barley, boozy bourbon, oak, vanilla, dark chocolate; toffee and caramel come out as it warms
M - full body, sticky sweet, boozy but not overly considering the ABV of this monster
O - I don't know - it's been awhile since I had any sort or BCBS, but this was a let down. I can't say there were any off flavors or anything like that, and it definitely was good, just not that good. And that's not even bringing price into the picture, which I always try to avoid when reviewing a beer. All in all, I've wanted to try this beer for years, and now that I have, I doubt I'll ever have it again. 900 charactersbarnzy78, Jan 10, 2016

Tastes like deeply roasted coffee and booze. Very sweet and raisin-y. Feels a little slick on the tongue. Counter-intuitively, the carbonation on this seem to grow as this beer warmed up.

L: black pour with a tan-auburn head.  Fades to thin lacing at the edges of the glass against.  Ruby-brown color at the edge, otherwise opaque black
S: I could smell the coffee before it even was poured.  The bourbon comes out well but not overpowering, offset by hints of vanilla, caramel, brown sugar, marshmallow.
T: fudgy brownie, with more bourbon and hints of dark fruit and raisins.  I've been getting this taste in stouts recently so I think it's my tastebuds going through a phase.  Touch of bitterness at the end, not sure if from coffee or hops.
F: very thick, syrupy.
O: no signs of infection here!  I think I might still prefer the base bourbon county over this, as the coffee they chose is quite complex and brought a host of interesting notes with it, some of which distract from the underlying stout 850 charactersGtwreck45, Jan 06, 2016

I literally felt myself getting smarter and hipster-cupping worthy. The coffee hangs on throughout the drink too, playing well with the roast. Pretty aggressive roastiness--a tiny bit more bourbon sweetness would have helped keep the gnarliness down, but ba speedway offers that. I think this is the better of the two bc of the drinkability. Cup this. 431 charactersbennyman12, Jan 05, 2016

Taste is off the charts, milky but roasty, lots of the aforementioned coffee and chocolate flavors, sweet vanilla and slight dark dried fruits (prunes, dates, raisins etc), just a 100/100 if there ever is one! 531 charactersbgold86, Jan 04, 2016

Nice dark coloration, with a thin head that dissipates immediately. Doesn't appear to coat the glass like the regular BCBS does, though it does leave some legs. Massive green pepper on the nose, so much so that it covers up most anything else, there is a bit of roasted malt or coffee aroma. The flavor starts out with a burnt coffee flavor, with a very sour finish, almost like sour cherries, and a uncharacteristically thin body. It would appear this beer is infected with some sort of wild yeast or bacteria judging by the sourness and loss of body and mouthfeel. Which sucks as the bcbcs was always my fav variant. This beer is a shadow of it's former self. I see other people mentioning the green pepper and sourness, yet still rating the beer over a 4.0...what's up with that?
*****
Pours a dark black color, with just a touch of amber on the edges when held to a light. Not much head to speak of, more of a brown colored sudsy layer, that forms a small, bubbly ring.
The aroma definitely has a coffee, vanilla and bourbon quality. However it's much more than just that, there are deep caramel notes, brown sugar and espresso. Just rich and creamy, I can tell there is some definite complexity to this beer.
The flavor is intensely complex. You're hit initially with a well developed espresso flavor combines with bouzy bourbon notes and a rich creamy quality. It finishes with a well developed a burn that doesn't overpower the roasted, bitter coffee flavors that round this beer out.
Full bodied and creamy mouthfeel. BCBCS really is impressive. So complexly flavored and I love that the coffee character can stand out amongst all the bourbony goodness. It is quite rich so I certainly can't drink much of it, but really who cares? 1,846 charactersSoneast, Dec 20, 2015

L - dark as night. minimal head. some lacing. motor oil
S - boozy smell.  A little chocolate and coffee, but mostly a boozy bourbon
T - Big time layers.  Coffee, then bourbon, then sweet dark chocolate with a finish mostly of milk chocolate.  Really nice path for the whole flavor profile and all of these flavors are surrounded by a nice charred oak flavor.  A lot going on.
M - thick, sticky,  and viscous.  Absolutely coated my mouth.  No booze at all and highly drinkable.
Overall this was a great coffee ba stout.  I love the coffee flavors this year as they seem much more potent and bold.  That said, it does cause for a little more overpowering than I prefer as I love that normal balance of coffee, chocolate, and bourbon.  I see this coming together in about 4-6 months.  This is all getting very particular and using a very high set bar from previous years and high expectations.  This really is a tremendous beer, and I am glad I have a few more to see how the flavors continue to develop.  Keep up the great barreling work GI! 1,084 charactersrabbott2, Dec 16, 2015

Smells oaky, vanilla, mild coffee smell. Taste is superb. The coffee really combines well with the aged bourbon. This is one of the best beers I've had. I would like to try one with less aging to compare to get more coffee flavor. 337 charactershophead7117, Dec 11, 2015

Served in a snifter
2014 vintage
This beer pours black. There were some mocha bubbles on top for a second. They disappeared so quickly I have to try and recall the appearance. It looks almost like ink in my glass.
There is still a nice coffee aroma. I also get vanilla, caramel, and bourbon. It has a dessert smell.
It starts out with coffee and anise. I think the perceived anise is from coffee flavor being a year old rather than fresh. The coffee blends into the vanilla and caramel flavors creating a wonderful tasting experience. The alcohol is well hidden. 
Full mouthfeel. Very low carbonation
This is the first Bourbon County that I have gotten to try. While I would love to have had a fresh one, the year old version is very tasty. I think it is similar to an almost year old Sunday Morning Stout that I had recently. 849 charactersbuschbeer, Dec 11, 2015

Not sure having fresh is the best for this beer unless you really like coffee. Personally I thought cellaring would allow to mellow out the flavors and allow the burnt coffee and rich cocoa nib flavors to play off each other better. This was too much black coffee and not enough well rounded beer mouth feel for me. Lot going on in this beer though from the vanilla aromatics 415 charactersBiggiekrock627, Dec 06, 2015

Bottled 9/17/15.
Pours opaque black viscous like 50 weight motor oil! 
Thin wisp of dark tan head around rim of snifter.
Aroma of bourbon, coffee, chocolate and a hint of black licorice.
Flavor is dominated by dark rich espresso followed by chocolate and bourbon.
Finishes with a nice alcohol warmth.
Overall a fantastic beer! Typical character of BCBS, but more mellow and round with the addition of coffee. 500 charactersmadbrewer9, Dec 06, 2015

Beer poured black with a nice brown head upon the initial pour.
Nose is perfection with so much going on.  Catching coffee, chocolate, vanilla, and bourbon notes in full on fashion.
Taste is chocolate, coffee, light bourbon, vanilla, and oak all melded to near perfection.
Mouthfeel is medium bodied and very smooth.
Overall this is one of the best beers i have had in my beer drinking career!  Unfortunately this is highly regarded by many others  and as a result is so hard to come by.  It is pretty pricey but it is worth the price of admission - Find it and drink it if available!
12/16/16 Edit for the 2016 version bottled on 21SEP16 batch 1528 from Whole Foods 20th street - still an awesome beer, a bit thin in the mouthfeel and no head to speak of.  Nose is coffee mocha goodness; taste is coffee forward, roasted notes, mocha, vanilla barrel notes.  I do have a second bottle that i am considering aging for 6-8 months. 1,031 charactersarizcards, Dec 05, 2015

I recently had the last 3 Bourbon County stouts 2013-15 on draft (thanks to #3 Craft beers in Cape Coral) and also had the 2014 in bottle last year. This difference was very noticeable, with the coffee taste (and the aroma even more so) extremely prominent. Being a stout and coffee lover, this just can't be beat. The alcohol is not evident in the taste, and the balance is just right. I love Speedway and Peche Mortel, and this is in the same ballpark as far as I'm concerned. If you get a chance to try it, don't pass! 581 charactersJohnnyDuvel, Dec 04, 2015

Pours like motor oil. No light shining through at all. A very minimal yet dark caramel-colored head is created then dissipates rather quickly.
Aroma is dominated almost entirely by bourbon. Nice amount of roasted malt, little bit of vanilla, and a nice smokiness. The coffee is more mild on the aroma than expected. It is present, but it is blended amongst the other aromas. Some maple syrup.
A major difference that I have detected between the coffee varietal and the regular stout is that the coffee cuts through the normally sweet base stout. The coffee varietal is a bit more bitter and roasted, as is coffee in general. The taste starts with the bourbon which combines with a nice amount of vanilla and a little smokiness. Molasses and sweet malts come in during mid-sip. This sweetness does not last long, as the coffee enters into the game to finish off the sip and into the aftertaste. It cuts the sweetness and imparts a slight bitterness. The bitterness is on par with beers like parabola or kbs; however, this beer is substantially better. Alcohol heat and flavor is present and warms the entire body. The coffee is definitely more present as the beer warms.
As is classic with bourbon county, this beer has a viscosity and mouthfeel that no stout can beat. Absolutely fantastic beer, but in my opinion not worth the extra hype, cost, and effort over the original stout. As with all the world class beers I try, I recommend not pairing the beer with anything as you will want to experience the beer unadulterated and free from competing flavors. It gets a 97.5/100. 1,633 charactersDaverCS, Dec 02, 2015

I for one will never buy G.I again, shame, as i used to be a big fan.
Pours like its gone flat, no head, smell is of coffee and booze.  The taste and mouthfeel of this beer are the highlights though, subtle coffee on top of the already near perfect base beer, the mouthfeel is thick and creamy. 525 charactersmanfromanotherplace, Nov 30, 2015

S: bitter coffee with bourbon
T: the coffee is not as bitter as it smells, and plays a huge role in the flavor profile as compared to last years which was hard to pickup at all.  There is a big bourbon, but the two flavors don't seem to be complimentary.
F: smooth and pretty thick, and the flavors last a long time just on one sip. 360 charactersyesterdayfaraway, Nov 30, 2015

He thought it was really good, but that the coffee was too strong. I disagreed as I thought he coffee flavor was there, but was not overpowering at all. I felt that it was subtle and just gave the beer a little extra something to separate it (and make it superior) to ththe regular BCBS.

Pours almost a slightly lighter black, with a coffee colored head that lingers around the rim of the glass.
Definitely get the coffee in the nose, though it's less present than I expected (though it could be due to a slight congestion affecting smell).
Taste brings the expected bourbon and coffee, in a solid balance. The coffee flavors almost carry the notes of caramel and toffee, but there is no milky ness to the mouth feel.
Higher carbonation than expected, but that balances out the mouthfeel nicely. 560 charactersBsquirrelbrewer, Nov 29, 2015

The first taste right out of the tap was not impressive because it was too cold. Once it warmed up the trade was phenomenal! Strong coffee, not a lot of bourbon.

L - Pitch black in all aspects. Less than a finger of dark khaki head
S - Massive bourbon and high-end coffee with hints of oak and tobacco.
T - Coffee and chocolate have replaced the overwhelming tobacco and char from the standard BCBS. Some nice vanilla and mocha notes are good too.
F - Dead-on for a BA stout. Thick and viscous with no alcohol whatsoever.
O - An improvement on a world-class BA stout. Coffee and bourbon blend beautifully much more so than other brewery's attempts as a coffee bourbon stout. 530 charactersThrewRedButter, Nov 28, 2015

A - Very dark brown with a very thin brown head. Light amount of soapy lacing.

T - The flavor follows the aroma. Bourbon, vanilla, and dark chocolate. The coffee comes through in the finish providing a nice light bitterness.
M - Heavy body with medium carbonation. The mouthfeel is smooth with a sticky dry finish.

Beer is dark brown on the borderline of black.  Thick and viscous pour, like used motor oil.  In a good way.  
A vigorous pour generates a one-finger dark brown head that doesn't hang around too long.
Aroma is dark roasted coffee, chocolate and a hint of bourbon.  Fantastic nose.
Flavor is strong, smooth and well-meshed.  Coffee, chocolate, wood and bourbon.  Wonderful.
Mouthfeel is thick and silky smooth.
At nearly five years old, this beer is fantastic.  Many thanks to Thirstgoat (Jeff) for the bottle! 600 characterscharlzm, Oct 12, 2015

Very warm, has that sense of bourbon to it. Saving a few of these to age them over time, but this beer is excellent! Can't wait for this year's release. 231 charactersdug53, Oct 09, 2015

Oh, the humanity! The manager of the store at which I work, part time, decided to clean out the storage area and put some goodies out in a grocery cart with a sign: "Two per customer per day". Along with such goodies as Surly Eight and Deschutes The Dissident sat a handful of 2014 Bourbon County Brand Stout and Coffee Stout. I bought one of each as soon as I got into work. The Coffee Stout is everything I imagined it to be. The only flaw I could possibly point out is the lack of a significant head, but this is a minor quibble when one considers the totality of this magnificent brew. The aroma is molasses and coffee. The flavor is coffee, molasses, a tiny bit of roastiness and a touch of vanilla and bourbon. It feels like silk running over my tongue, and the alcohol is subtly warming, despite the high ABV. A little taller and longer lasting head might have raised my overall rating, but this is damned near perfect. 973 charactersmnredsoxfan69, Sep 20, 2015

Dark color, pours like motor oil.
Coats mouth while drinking. 
Smell is more barrel (alcohol, vanilla, coconut) with a secondary coffee aroma coming through.
Only complaint is that there is still heat present on the aftertaste that detracts from the other flavors. 278 charactersRJIV, Sep 14, 2015

2012 version. Jet black. Nose was a little weak. Taste is a super smooth, rich coffee and chocolate with hints of the barrel. Very very good. Highly recommended.

Cocoa, coffee and bourbon is a combo that can negatively affect a beer if not balanced, but if Goose Island ever had that problem, it has been long since resolved.  This is a decadent beer that gets better as it warms.  The 13+% ABV is there for sure, but rarely is it so smooth. 362 charactersBerrymon, Aug 19, 2015

L - Oil black, with a very thin tan head that quickly disapated.
S - Mostly bourbon, some slight coffee and chocolate undertones.
T - Very similar to the smell - mostly bourbon with hints of coffee and chocolate.
F - This is where is stands out to me when compared to KBS and SMS - extremely thick, creamy, and smooth.
O - I'm a huge fan of coffee stouts, and up until I had this SMS was my favorite beer.  I think this is my new favorite.  Big and robust feel is what sets it apart.  I would like to try it a bit more fresh as I think some of the coffee has faded, but at this point it's probably more well balanced.  Definitely worth seeking out if you have the opportunity. 736 charactersWolfpac78, Aug 09, 2015

I am extremely lucky: I had the privilege of sampling this spectacular brew with two of my best friends in the world. If you like coffee, stouts, and bourbon then you won’t be able to put this masterpiece down. For such a “heavy/dark” creation, BCBCS still appears to be quite ‘thin’ and translucent as compared to some of the other murky/clouded stouts. The smells, however, are as bold and domineering as one would expect from the original barrel aged stout; roasted coffee is by far the most pronounced fragrance and it even overpowers the bouquet of bourbon, dark chocolate, and vanilla that are eventually made known. The taste in one word is: perfect. Espresso forward. Molasses. Wood. Slightly vanilla. Impeccable. If you fall under the type of flavor profile listed above, go get BCBCS now. Literally now. I don’t care what you have to do. 867 charactersljjpowers, Aug 07, 2015

A - Black with almost no head at all. You can see the thickness as it pours.
S - Coffee and sweet bourbon mostly with a cherry fruitiness.
T - Follows the nose with roasted coffee and bourbon. A bit sweet with some fruit notes.
F - Perfection. Extremely thick, syrupy, and sticky with just a hint of carbonation.

Nose very reminiscent of BCBS, your classic bourbon profile with some dark fruit and deep, roasty coffee creeping in the backdrop. Coffee flavor comes in waves up front and as I swallow but the flavor itself is pretty muted already at just beyond half a year old. Enhances the roasted malt dynamics of this big, viscous, beautiful beast of a beer. 
The only way InBev makes there money off me and it's worth every penny every time, the whole lineup is killer and this one definitely stands in attention as the better 12oz offering. 565 charactersVetsPackage, Jul 28, 2015

Is it even possible to make a better coffee stout?  I'm leaning towards no.
Pours used motor oil black.  Coffee notes beat up nose and palate upfront.  Smooth full-bodied aftertaste with that great bourbon finishing note.  Definitely the best coffee stout I've had to date. 306 characterseifster82, Jul 04, 2015

4.99/5  rDev +9%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 52014 bottle - 6 1/2 months from the "bottled on" date
Look - Very dark with a slight light tan head.  A little more bubbly than what I was expecting, since my previous experiences with Bourbon County have appeared almost sludge-like.
Smell - Coffee & bourbon, obviously.  Also detect malts, dark chocolate & toffee.
Taste - Amazing.  Very strong coffee taste up front, but it doesn't stay for long.  It stays present while the bourbon, chocolate and malts that I found in the nose arrive to the party.  After I swallow the (after)taste most present is the bourbon, it definitely stays with you.  But I am also left with a bitter chocolate taste & a hint of cherries (I'll be honest:  I didn't notice the cherry until I read other reviews but it definitely brought it to my attention.  Could just be placebo but I don't think so.)
Feel - Thick, sticky, with a slight carbonation that gives a nice sensation as I sip.
Overall - I think this is the greatest beer I've ever had in my life.  My only time drinking it, so I don't know what it's like super fresh, or with some real age on it... But based on this it would be excellent no matter how old/young the bottle. 1,168 charactersPourharddrinkslow, Jun 24, 2015

4.67/5  rDev +2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75L: Jet black, watered down oil. Pours with some weight. 
S: The first 2 months after bottling, the thing smells like you stuck your face into a bag of Intelligentsia coffee, leading straight up to the taste. Coffee starts to wane off after three or so months to a much more even coffee:bourbon barrel smell. 
T: Taste is dominated with coffee when fresh. After a few months of aging (personal sweet spot is about 5-6 months), the coffee blends nearly perfectly with the sweet, sticky bourbon barrel. Any longer than that, you're just losing what you paid for: the freshly roasted coffee. Sure it still tastes like a great coffee stout, but no better than a KBS or Sunday Morning Stout. 
F: Syrupy, thick and sticky. Aboslutely lovely. Could be a tad thicker but I'm just nit picking. 
O: Damn good beer. Looking forward to Black Wednesday every year... 856 charactersJuglashB, Jun 12, 2015

5/5  rDev +9.2%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A truly amazing beer.  I could not find anything lacking.  Thanks to BoldRulerVT for the share.  2013 bottles poured into tulip glasses and enjoyed around the fire in celebration of the triple crown winner.  
Dirty-oil black with a 1/2 finger of brown fluffy head that slowly dissipates to a thick ring leaving curtains of brown lace down the glass.  
Aroma is a mixture of mostly bourbon, some coffee, dried dark fruit and cherries, and a slight bit of roasted dark malt.  
Taste is heavy, but not overwhelming, with bourbon, mixed with dried cherry, molasses, and hints of coffee and chocolate.  Delicious.  
Mouth is perfect.   Medium/full bodied, with  fairly low carbonation....never cloying or thick.  After an 8 oz pour, I would have easily enjoyed another.
Overall, a sensational beer that I WANT MORE OF!! 819 charactersFFreak, Jun 08, 2015

In honor of American Pharoah winning the Triple Crown, these two bottles were opened around a bonfire and held in salute to an incredible achievement.
2013 BCBCS. Poured into tulips. Pours jet black. Zero light comes through barely any head that does manage to remain. Aromas are bourbon, toasted oak, coffee, deep dark roasty malts. Flavor is insane. Perfection, a perfect balance of bourbon, roasted coffee, roasted malt, and oak. Balanced, round. Mouthfeel is perfection. Any thinner and I'd be upset, any thicket and it would be distracting. This beer is fucking mind blowing. I may never get to enjoy it again, but this was the perfect occasion for the best stout I've ever tasted in my life. 819 charactersBoldRulerVT, Jun 07, 2015

4.43/5  rDev -3.3%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.52013 bottle.
Look:  Deep dark brown body.  The light and simple mocha head quickly retreats to a thin halo.  Legs and lacing are minimal, but they are slippery, and melt with style.
Smell:  The smell is surprisingly like Prairie Bomb.  I smell bourbon and chocolate, maybe some background coffee.  Sweet cream...Some astringency.    
Taste:  Rich and full of flavor.  Sweet roasted barley, coffee, chocolate, a touch of lactose sweetness, and bourbon barrel.  Nice, sweet and creamy finish.
Feel:  Silky and creamy mouth feel.  Lower level of carbonation.  Soft feeling.
Overall - To me, this is very similar to Prairie Bomb.  With the first whiff, I was not impressed.  After sitting around contemplating each sip, and letting it warm, I have come to the conclusion that this is a world-class stout, but not the best American Double/Imperial Stout there is, as some have said.  I like Parabola, Bourbon Barrel Aged Plead the Fifth, and maybe Barrel Aged Dark Apparition better.  This beer is on the same level with those, and some other top tier imperial stouts. 1,065 charactersmabermud, May 30, 2015

Appearance: An inky, jet black with a quickly dissipating mocha colored head. Sticky, obsidian body with little tiny bubbles around the rim.
Aroma: Tons of coffee and a tiny bit of vanilla bourbony notes. Really potent! Goddamn, this brew smells like a million bucks.
Taste: Like it smells....possibly the most coffee-forward beer I've ever had, though Tree House's Triple Shot and Good Morning had a more powerful flavor overall (really nitpicking here, this is an elite, top-tier coffee stout). A fantastic treat with lots of coffee, some chocolate, and some vanilla. Incredibly balanced and an incredibly delicious beer.
Feel: More carbonated than I expected when watching the pour and looking at the head on the beer, but really sticky. Lots of lingering flavor and a heavy, thick, syrupy body. 
Overall: One of the best coffee stouts in existence, easily. Incredibly flavorful, with a potent aroma and a great body. 966 charactersTheElectricOne, May 15, 2015

Poured a thick, creamy black with a short but gorgeous tan head. Smelled mostly of bourbon with minimal coffee notes. It tasted every bit of the 13% ABV, as many BA brews do, and I was hoping for a bit more coffee flavor than I got. Still, it was excellent and I hope I can get more in the future 406 charactersKBrady, Apr 14, 2015

Appearance: pours a deep walnut color. small tan head with weak retention and no lacing. small brown viscosity as it swirls around the glass. dark and completely opaque. 
Smell: coffee, slightly towards the stale end of the spectrum. chocolate, dark fruits and bourbon.
Taste: opens up with coffee, has a hint of fresh coffee to it before become stale and old. bourbon and a bit of booze come in. the back end is weak but has notes of dark fruits and chocolate.
Mouthfeel: heavy and viscous. some alcohol warmth. some coffee bitterness.
Overall: the freshest one is easily the best of the bunch as I expected. that said I'm not to impressed with it. the coffee already tastes slightly stale and only gets worse with ages. the coffee takes away the complexity of dark fruits and sweet malts that stand out in the standard version. 920 charactersSportsandJorts, Mar 31, 2015

The coffee is still so prominent with a nice bitter bite but just a fantastic smooth sweet finish.  The 13.4% ABV has mellowed out but is still present without distracting from the great flavors of this beer.  Very, very well done. 297 charactersBeerNW, Mar 21, 2015

A. Pours an almost black /brown motor oil with 1 finger of cappuccino colored head that resides quickly.
S.  Notes of bourbon, mocha, roasted malts, vanilla.  Smells like a brownie with alcohol.
T.  The coffee is very pronounced from the regular variant.  If BCBS can get any better it's with coffee.  It carries huge through the aftertaste.  Lovin this!
M.  IMO BCBS is the perfect body for  BA stout.  So 5 here.  Thick with some carbonation.
O.  I love reg BCBS.  But this takes the cake.  That coffee really hits it off.  Everything is perfect besides it should have a better appearence and aroma.  dont get alot of coffee there. But nonetheless if there is a beer that deserves almost a perfect it's this. One of the best stouts i've had! 781 charactersIPAGeorge, Mar 16, 2015

4.71/5  rDev +2.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75On tap at the Groveland Tap in St. Paul, MN. 10 oz. serving in a chalice. 2014 vintage.
Appearance: Color is an oily midnight black. Moderate amount of bubbles and a decent finger of tan head that fades into a thin creamy layer. 
Smell: A very roasty and rich dark malt driven aroma with huge hints of coffee, chocolate, and bourbon. Big upfront scent of coffee beans along with dark roasted barley malt hints of dark chocolate, burnt toast, smoke, biscuit, caramel, and yeast. Big barrel presence with hints of bourbon whiskey, vanilla, oak, and wood. Sweet scent of molasses sugars. Subtle dark fruit hints of cherry and prune. A really great smell. 
Taste: Like the nose indicates, a very rich and roasty dark malt driven taste with lots of coffee, chocolate, and bourbon. Big upfront taste of bitter dark roast coffee beans. Dark roasted barley malt with big notes of dark chocolate, biscuit, toast, toffee, caramel, smoke, and yeast. Big barrel taste with notes of bourbon whiskey, sweet vanilla, wood, and oak. Sweet taste of molasses along with some tobacco and anise. Subtle dark fruit undertones of cherry, raisin, and prune. A great roasty taste. 
Mouthfeel: Thick and full bodied with a moderate amount of carbonation. Creamy, syrupy, and fairly chewy. The huge alcohol percentage is masked pretty well. 
Overall: A truly great Barrel Aged Coffee Stout. Great blend of coffee, chocolate, and bourbon barrel flavors with a body that is thick but still drinkable. Glad to finally try this after striking out on the bottles for the last few years. 1,560 charactersMattyG85, Feb 26, 2015

4.96/5  rDev +8.3%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5Serving: 12 oz. bottle poured into a Founder's CBS snifter. Bottled on 11/7/14, making this about 3.5 months old. 
A: Pours a tad thinner than BCBS, but still pitch black. Almost no head to speak of. Very still in the glass.
S: Just bursting with fresh pour-over coffee. Just a hint of vanilla and chocolate. Bourbon is present, but greatly masked by the coffee. There's a touch of dark fruit sweetness, but this is all coffee, all the way. Easily the best smelling coffee beer out there. 
T: Wow, just wow. Fantastic coffee flavor up front. Just like fresh pour-over coffee. It's very clean and balanced, with a touch of spiciness to it. Bourbon comes through in the finish with loads of dry chocolate, vanilla, and toffee. 
M: The coffee brings a sense of thinness here, which is different from BCBS. However, it's still very nice and full. Perfectly balanced beer. Booze well hidden in the taste, but definitely warms your belly.
O: So back when this was in bombers, I wasn't the biggest fan of this beer. But man, has it grown on me over time. In terms of pure coffee stouts, this is tops. It's magnificently balanced and the coffee is never overpowering. It's such a perfect interplay between bourbon and coffee. Amazing, amazing beer.
Recommendation: The only true annual-release variant, this should be on every craft beer lover's bucket list. 1,356 charactersSparty1224, Feb 24, 2015

The odor is powerful, with notes of coffee, sweet chocolate, toffee, vanilla, dried fruits, plum, raisin, bourbon, rich, whiskey, woods, slight resin, earthy.  The taste is velvety, chocolate, bourbon, woods up front.  Then very fruity, fig, dates, raisin.  Very coffee towards the back as well as dry woods.  Barely any bitterness at all, very easy drinking. 427 charactersSandalwood, Feb 21, 2015

Much coffee on the nose and the initial taste is similar, then quickly gives way to the bourbon.  Warmed to near room temp and this didn't change it much. 168 charactersIowaBiertrinker, Feb 18, 2015

Poured thick, with an excellent aroma of coffee and a hint of chocolate and fruit. Great taste, and loved the carbonated feel, the strength of the taste and alcohol. Strong, but easy to drink. Not as bitter as the standard stout, I will definitely seek out this version, and I look forward to trying others in this great line of beers! Well done Goose Island!!! 454 charactersdukeandduke, Feb 16, 2015

Smell- That sweet, roasty coffee that puts that happy feeling in you heart. Great Bourbon and oak that make you say Oooooo WEEE!
Taste- That coffee is the truth. It cannot lie no matter how much it wants to.
Feel- So creamy and smooth. Almost as good as the first time ;)
Overall- Halfway through I had to take to bed and show it proper loving. This is one you take home to Mom. 452 charactersHeatwave33, Feb 16, 2015

A: Black, no light on the edges. Medium carbonation that dissipates quickly.

T: Dark chocolate chased by strong coffee aftertaste
M: Coats your mouth and chocolate/coffee flavors linger after every sip
O: Amazing. I was lucky to try one of these and I'd do it again in a heartbeat. Nicely balanced but still very bold in flavor. 487 characterschrisjws, Feb 13, 2015

I am a fan of bourbon and stouts, so this line up from GI suits me well. The Coffee Stout lives up to all the hype for me. It has a better balance overall than the regular BCBS (which I like as well). I like that the coffee taste does not overpower, it seems to offset some of the sweetness of the regular BCBS. Highly recommend! 398 characterstjcapture, Feb 13, 2015

4.82/5  rDev +5.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Probably the best coffee stout I have ever had. No doubt!
Appearance: Dark as night no light at all. Like the regular BCBS basically no head at all, which is the hit for points.
Smell: Coffee dominant, booze but not overly so, very well balanced coffee stout, best in the world hard to say but definitely one of the better ones.
Taste: Very well balanced. This beer can give you the balance of stout and coffee and nice blend of coffee for sure. Not too booze forward, but it is solid for sure. Nice creamy mouthfeel which add's to the flavor profile. 
Overall: This is probably the best coffee stout I have had I wish I had access to more! 644 charactershumuloner22, Jan 27, 2015

Pours a pitch black with very little head and even smaller amount of lacing. I do feel as if the coffee flavor had faded a bit but the taste was still a very smooth, sweet malt, dark fruit,toffee,molasses, and a hint of milk chocolate. No heat and a little oily but very enjoyable. The taste of this was very similar to Parabola. Love this and need to find more. 440 charactersdutesanch, Jan 18, 2015

I had this alongside Abraxas and Berserker, as part of their Strong Ale Fest, and it was interesting to compare these three Imperial Stouts.  At first taste, the BCBCS seemed a little in the shadow of the other two beers, both of which have quite a few more strong flavors competing for your attention.  But over a forty-five minute time drinking all three beers, BCBCS really came to the fore.  It's so smooth, so perfectly balanced.  It's just the right combination of an incredible stout, with coffee, vanilla, and whisky flavors all blended together harmoniously.   It's got a quiet intensity and great depth.  At the end, my wife and I both agreed that it was our favorite among these three exceptional stouts. 750 charactersVashonGuy, Jan 17, 2015

A:  As always, this is the only subpar aspect of the BC beers.  Pours thick black but with minimal head, carbonation, and lacing.  Just "meh."  
S:  Probably the best of the series.  Tons of oaken vanilla, as always, but this one has a lot more chocolate and coffee bean notes.  Those additional scents really go well with the vanilla.
T:  Again, like the other beers of the series, this one is quite good.  Tons of vanilla, roasted coffee beans (however, not too bitter like in other coffee stouts), and a lot of sweet chocolate.  More creamy than the other beers in the series.
F:  Nice, thick, and sticky.  Good.
O:  Great beer. 702 charactersleantom, Jan 11, 2015

This beer takes the extremes of the beer world and mashes them together. Imagine a cross between the sweetness and creaminess of a really good milk stout with the viscosity and complexity of a Russian imperial stout. That is BCBCS. Flavor was deep, sweet, rich, oaky bourbon, tons of chocolate, vanilla and coffee. Perhaps there was a hint of amaretto too. Incredibly complex. The texture was oily, thick, and barely carbonated. I split a 12oz bottle with 3 friends and it was incredibly satisfying. I could have drank a little more, but the full bottle would have been too much for me.

4.39/5  rDev -4.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.512 oz bottle spit between four samplers.  Entered from notes of 12/28/14.
Color is nearly black with a minimal tan head coating the surface.  Semi-sticky lacing.  Smell is dark roasted coffee, anise, booze and dark fruit.  Flavor is coffee on the palate with a blast of chocolate.  I didn't initially pick up on the chocolate on the nose.   I also taste anise, bourbon/booze and dark fruit as I swirl it around in my mouth.  It's very good.  Body is medium with mild carbonation leading to a very creamy mouthfeel.
Overall, it's an excellent BA stout and lives up to the hype. 578 charactersmr-jj, Jan 09, 2015

4.54/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5My first experience with this beer was the 2013 vintage, sampled alongside Boubon County Brand Stout 2013. 
The second was a 2014 bottle, consumed recently. 
Side by side with BCBS, BCBCS loses out by a small margin, but perhaps just because the coffee had faded just a bit too much. 
The newer bottle beat out all others it faced in a recent tasting by a considerable margin. It was pretty terrific. 
In the future, my rule will be to drink the coffee "fresh" (within a year) while cellaring the regular stout for a couple of years. 537 charactersrodmanfor3, Jan 09, 2015

N.  Smells hot, so much more heat than I thought I would have noticed.  Vanilla, coffee, bourbon city, more bourbon and more bourbon.
T.  This was my first, hopefully not my last.  Phenomenal like I thought it would be.  Hot, this beer has some heat.  Really well balanced but would have liked a little more coffee to shine.  Not complaining though, it was there.  Tons of bourbon, vanilla, dark rich flavors that give great complexity.
M.  Creamy, thick, freakin wonderful.

4.6/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Bottle from Kevin, thank you very much, 2012 version with La Tortuga coffee.
Pours a viscous, black color, with a small, soon fading head.
The aromas got a hot Bourbon burn to them, wrapped up into slightly bitter, earthy coffee, with lots of bakers chocolate, molasses and toffee. The coffee acts outstandingly well with the wooden, vanilla accentuated, hot Bourbon, blending flawlessly into the rich, creamy base of the beer. Nontheless, the Bourbon stands out on itself quite well and is even more noteable than the coffee.
Drinks incredible smooth, not particularly creamy, but outstandingly silk, with calming, earthy notes to it, providing an intriguing interplay between milk chocolate and slightly sticky toffee. The Bourbon is big in this, without getting too boozy at any point, while producing a pleasant, oaken warmth with vanilla notes in it, complimenting to the slightly bitter coffee, as well as the scorched, earthy malts and sweet milk chocolate. The coffee becomes visible on the palate, paired with slick caramel and cocoa nibs, while a wooden earthiness adds to the subtle coffee sting, resulting from the harmonious, convenient integrated Bourbon. Finishes with sweeter toffee, as well as molasses and hints of coffee, while smooth, slightly sweeter milk chocolate represents the foundation of this beer. 1,329 charactersaleigator, Jan 03, 2015

12oz bottle split between four samplers.
Pours black and flat. Smell is coffee, yeast, alcohol, anise, and plum. There's plenty of chocolate in the aroma as well.
Taste is chocolate and coffee, lots of chocolate, and some anise. Lots of sweetness. Maybe plums. Lots of alcohol -- fading to an alcohol burn.
Mouthfeel is silky and smooth, a little graininess. Overall, an excellent beer. Happy to try it. A bit sweet, if you want more than a few ounces of it. 472 characterssnaotheus, Dec 29, 2014

4.94/5  rDev +7.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5#500, boy did that work out perfectly.
Pours a deep black with a dark mocha head which soon fades except aroung ththedges of the sniffer. Good lacing for the lack of head.
Aroma is sweet and sexy. Toasted oak, toffee, licorice, dark chocolate, medium dark roast coffee, vanilla, and a buttery syrupy greatness. Very light alcohol scent. I expected it to be much more in your face, but instead it's just balance here that makes it so great.
Wow. It's hardly similar to regular BCBS. Caramel, coffee which has almost no bitter notes to it, buttered syrup, beautifully aged bourbon full of charred oak, vanilla and just a tad bite. The bourbon is definitely the most dominant, followed by coffee, the flavors from the malts are more subdued, providing a pleasant backdrop. As it sits it just gets so great. Almost no bite, and just taste like buttery coffey bourbon. Overall smoother, less sweet, and more balanced than the regular. Perfection?
Buttery and chewy. Definitely less viscous than the regular. Almost no carbonation, nor any need for it.
Best beer ever? Maybe not. Best beer I've had? Probably so. Seems perfectly aged and perfectly balanced. So glad that a beer so great arrived in time to make my #500. 1,218 charactersMrBoh, Dec 28, 2014

2013 vintage poured on 12/26/2014 into a Teku beer glass.
A perfect beer in every way. Perfectly balanced, wonderful aromas complement the coffee undertones and hints of oak and vanilla. Complex, yet smooth and integrated with an impossibly long lingering finish. A great effort and a year of bottle age seemed perfect. 373 charactersJasonHaviland, Dec 27, 2014

Smells like the original, but the coffee seems to overpower the sweet bourbon and fudgy chocolate notes. The taste is even more coffee forward. It honestly tastes like a ba version of wake n bake. It's amazing, and the mouthfeel is thick and viscous, but I think I prefer the original. The coffee overpowers it a little. I'll definitely be revisiting again in a year or so and will never turn this beer down. 449 characterswinningwes91, Dec 26, 2014

L: Pitch black, pours like motor oil, little to no head, but what head there is is richly brown/red.
S: Rich, roasted, bitter coffee is the singular aroma, with bourbon tingling the nostrils. Evokes memories of coffee steam in the morning.
T: Absolutely at its best when it's nearly at room temperature. The coffee and bourbon notes play off one another beautifully throughout, one never overtaking the other, making for a wonderfully complex beer.
O: Typically my favorite BCS, I drank this immediately following a 2014 Vanilla Rye, which was magnificent but far less boozy than the 2013 Coffee I was drinking. Maybe 2013 was a boozier year for BCS? 711 charactersMichaelNeelsen, Dec 25, 2014

Pours thick viscous dark black in color with a rich mocha tan head that retains nicely. Smell is incredibly rich with decadent aromas of coffee, chocolate, fudge, sweet vanilla, with hints of cherry, toffee, graham cracker and oak in the end. Taste follows the nose with rich flavors of bakers chocolate, charred malt, espresso, vanilla, cherry, oak and bourbon in the finish. Mouthfeel is thick rich semi sweet mildly carbonated and incredibly smooth. 476 charactersFcolle2, Dec 24, 2014

All in, this is quite a let down. Don't get me wrrong, it's very good, but with all the hype one would expect it to be life changing. Perhaps it is in as much as I'll stop believing in hype.
This brand would di/itself a world of good if they get things back in persective. Only goes to show, it's tough at the to. 520 charactersseedyone, Dec 12, 2014

S: Smell is made up of coffee, caramel and plenty of chocolate as well (slight hint of booze). There is also a fruity flavor I cannot quite put my finger on (someone here mentioned plum...why may be a good call).
T: Coffee and lots of chocolate. Starts with a higher bourbon to coffee/vanilla taste ratio at the forefront and ends with a stronger coffee taste at the backend.
M: Mouthfeel is very smooth; pretty thick (full-bodied) with no carbonation .
O: This one ended up being my personal favorite of the 3. I'd like to drink it again sometime. 574 charactersembass, Dec 05, 2014

A: Pours a solid black with a small tan head, and very good lacing.
S: Amazing smell. First with a strong bourbon maybe even some dark fruits followed by an underlying dark chocolate and coffee.
T: Very close to the nose. After ageing it seems to have smoothed the taste not such an intense bourbon flavor at first. But still WOW so much flavor and very strong. Again the taste follows the nose almost exactly except there's not too much coffee after ageing. Very slight alcohol at the end but followed by and amazing after taste that stays with you.
M:Its feels very thick. The carbonation is nice but its for sure a slow drinker with a very thick almost sticky feel.
O: One of the best stouts I've ever had. Really intense flavors but still somewhat smooth and enjoyable to drink. Prefer this slight more then the standard BCBS. 872 charactersGinjaSlice, Dec 02, 2014

A- Very dark brown/black with a half inch caramel colored head that faded quickly. I gotta say, that orange labeled bottle standing next to the black snifter of beer is sexy....

Bottled on 11/15/13.
Pours opaque black with cola edges. The faint khaki head quickly disappears completely and leaves almost no lace... Motor oil.
The smell is of massive spent coffee grounds, vanilla, dark chocolate, Earthy oak, pipe tobacco and a hint of coconut. 
The taste is of black coffee, dark fruit sweetness, dark chocolate, toasted coconut and faint vanilla. 
The texture is heavy bodied, thick and viscous with low carbonation. 
Like getting cracked square in the mouth by Juan Valdez as he drunkenly stumbles out of a Kentucky distillery holding a fist-full of roasted coffee beans! Even after a year, this is a massive coffee/bourbon sucker punch... but, in a good way. A glorious coffee, dark chocolate and bourbon bomb. World class and near perfection. 870 charactersFurlinator, Nov 29, 2014

The flavors are just what you expect from the smell, and the mouthfeel is so slick and buttery for a big bold stout. This is the best of its kind... 379 charactersJefferyLaGrow, Nov 29, 2014

Surprisingly did not taste very bad, but the overpowering, pungent smell on this beer was disheartening.  No coffee notes came through.

Pours totally black with a short brown head that vanishes quickly in my tulip glass.
Big aroma of bourbon and what I can only describe as soy sauce. Coffee + bourbon = soy sauce? Hmmm.
The flavor is all about the bourbon, mixing with that soy sauce, along with coffee, chocolate and molasses. Fairly harsh.
Lovely body though. Creamy.
I find this to be the roughest of the three Bourbon County beers, and consequently my least favorite. Just get the imperial stout, it's easily the best of the bunch. Looking for a superior coffee stout? Try Terrapin Wake N Bake. 614 charactersShaw, Nov 23, 2014

5/5  rDev +9.2%This beer exceeds all expectations-
Appearance is a deep, dark brown, with no light shining through but some nice bubbles visible on the sides, pours a half finger of brown head that quickly dissipates.
Smell- sweet caramel, coffee, sweet bourbon.
Taste- upfront is malt sweetness, lots of caramel. followed by the coffee, which is very smooth and not bitter yet has an obvious presence. the sweet character of the bourbon is there but none of the alcoholic bite.
Texture of the beer is quite oily, with low carbonation. the body suits the flavor perfectly.
overall- this beer is a dream. all the hype does not prepare you for just how good this beer really is. 661 charactersSteveB24, Nov 19, 2014

3.5/5  rDev -23.6%Had a chance to try the 2014 vintage at the West Coast Barrel Aged Beerfest this past weekend. I've never had any other vintage. This beer has a certain spiciness to it (cayenne?). The spiciness isn't overwhelming, but it is enough to distract from both the coffee and bourbon that I was looking forward to. The 2012 vintage of the normal BCBS was being poured as well, which was phenomenal. 391 charactersOriginal_Gravity, Nov 11, 2014

4.65/5  rDev +1.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Poured into a Fremont small snifter. Pours pitch black with a 1/8" light brown head that dissipated to patches, but with light lacing. Aroma of sweet dark toasted malt, bourbon, chocolate and light coffee. Flavor is well melded lightly sweet toasted malt, dark chocolate, bourbon and latte coffee. Finish is coffee, chocolate and a bit of bourbon burn. Heavy bodied with a pleasant creaminess. My first of the many variants of the original BCBS, which has always been a favorite. The coffee is blended well with the other flavors and adds a surprisingly smooth new dimension. Like the base version, a world class imerial stout. I'd buy this again, but will never spend the time or gas required to get a single bottle of this. Delicious but too hard to find. 757 charactersLiquidAmber, Nov 10, 2014

3.53/5  rDev -22.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 3 | feel: 3 |  overall: 3.25The beer is lightly infected with what appears to be some wild yeast but it's weak enough that the beer is still somewhat drinkable and the smell isn't entirely compromised.
The beer pours a nice head  that dissipates quickly. The beer itself is a nice dark and opaque black with a bit of thickness to it. It's a nice look but does not seem to have the same good look as the regular one.
The smell is fantastic. It has a nice and strong coffee note the blends perfectly with a nice vanilla bean smell that complements it very well. Underneath this wonderful cornucopia of goodness is a sweet nuttiness that ends with a dark chocolate note.
The taste is disappointing because of a tart cherry note running through and dominating the taste. What few notes that do make it through is the nut and coffee note with a bit of vanilla from the oak. While the tart cherry flavor seemed to have added something while the beer was cold, it detract quite a bit when it warms up.   
The feel is a bit disappointing. It's not as thick as the regular county stout and the biting carbonation seems to further detract from the experience. There is also a dry and burning finish.
Overall, a decent but disappointing beer given the price and difficulty in obtaining this one beer.  Whether this beer is infected or not, it definitely wasn't worth it. Hopefully, my second bottle is better. 1,375 charactersHattedClassic, Oct 22, 2014

4.96/5  rDev +8.3%look: 4.25 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I waited a while to open this one, 2012 vintage enjoyed from the bomber in a snifter shared with KG ant tenderbranson69.
 The color is pitch black with no light passing through, the head arrives in a light beige band that settles rapidly to a ring of fine beads with speckles of lace collecting. The smell is intense to say the least, the first smell brings a ton of coffee aroma with light cocoa in the malt ester with gentle bourbon/wood in the nose. There is a sweet malt ester augmenting the aroma with a moderate alcohol odor as it gets warmeer with mild vanilla from the barrel and a slight dark sugar fragrance. The feel is incredible for a 14%+ beer according to the label it is smooth, rich and thick with medium carbonation and subtle oily coffee coating the palate with a mild sweetness level and rich bourbon laced texture with mild alcohol and semi-dry finish with a lingering roasted effect on the palate.
 The lovely coffee flavor envelopes and immmediately brings with it a roasted malt character -the two are intertwined in a symbiotic way with a mild sweet taste and mild molasses type flavor in the malt with rich cocoa-like body and dark chocolate alkaline accent. The roast of the coffee is subtle yet brings out the vanilla-like accents from the wood and bourbon character is easy to enjoy in the finish with alcohol adding to the coffee and deep malt base with a lovely nutty mix of roasted grain and bean. I like the way the malt has a sweet yet earthy essence and both bourbon and malt blend to promote a dark chocolate intensity  w/ slight coconut earthiness as it finishes dry. 
 I am blown away by the finesse of this, right from the beginning the coffee is noticeable and yet subtle enough to support the incredible base with this being an unrivaled Imperial Stout with coffee and bourbon -the richness are preserved well even with over a year of age. The 14.3% does not seem realistic based on the taste, so much complexity and flavor this was certainly memorable 1,996 charactersSlatetank, Oct 21, 2014

A: Pitch black and oily with only a small ring of khaki head clinging to the edges of the glass after a gentle pour.  A swirl gives way to a half finger head that dissipates quickly and leaves little to no lacing.  Just looks viscous and decadent in the glass.
S: Rich dark chocolate covered cherry, followed by massive coffee notes.  Sweet vanilla and woody bourbon follow and are equally as potent.  Unbelievably rich and potent aroma on this one. Overall one of the best noses of any beer I have had.
T: Bourbon soaked cherry, baker's chocolate, and bright, fruit forward coffee.  The interplay between the coffee and the rich bourbon barrel is unreal.  The base beer itself has obviously already been perfected, but the coffee varietal used this year results in the most seamless integration of beer and coffee flavors that I've experienced in a stout of this style.  Fantastic.
M: Thick and viscous, what would you expect? Low/moderate carb.
O: Just epic.  My favorite bourbon county and probably my favorite stout period.  Can't wait to try it again. 1,074 charactersMore_betterness, Oct 09, 2014

2012 was served from a bomber bottle near room temp.  Mellow coffee aroma, with more of a tropical coffee flavor.  Solid base stout.  Would have preferred it to be chilled a bit more, but the beer was excellent.  Dark tan head.
2013 served on tap and was more of a coffee bomb.  High quality coffee flavors on the beer base.  Nose is 95% coffee.  Same dark tan foam, dissipating to a swirl in the glass.  Flavors emerged more as it warmed a bit. 484 charactersDawgboned37, Oct 07, 2014

4.5/5  rDev -1.7%2014 pours deep brown with a thin khaki head. Minimal to no lacing probably because of abv. Nose is deep coffee. Smells like fresh ground beans taken from a grinder. Cocoa and mild caramel undertones. Taste is coffee, tobacco, cocoa but evena little vanilla on the back end. Boozy heat gives the viscose nature of the coffee a break.. Ultimately I'd say it's all its hyped up to be flavor wise, although I feel like this shouldnt be so hard to get.. 449 charactersfgmiele, Oct 04, 2014

A- Pours a totally opaque black color with a 1/8 inch light brown head that immediately subsides to a thin ring around the edge of the glass and nearly no surface foam.  
S- Dark roasted coffee dominates the aroma with some dark chocolate and booze following.  
T- More dark roasted coffee is strong right in the front and quite bitter.  There's also some vanilla, caramel and wood plus a firm but suitable alcohol presence.  The sweetness along with the solid coffee presence makes it oh so drinkable.  Nutty, bitter aftertaste.  
M- Viscous and creamy but not as creamy as regular BCBS.  Medium-low carbonation with the fullest of bodies.
O- The hype is well-deserved.  Definitely one of my new top 3 coffee beers.   The flavor is perfect, everything I look for in a coffee stout.  There's room for improvement in the aroma and mouthfeel IMO but overall it's truly a fantastic beer. 935 charactersImmortale25, Sep 23, 2014

5/5  rDev +9.2%2014-This is beautiful. Onyx in color, no appreciable head. Positively reeks of chocolate and coffee, but chocolate drops out in the mouth. Flavor is dominated by bourbon and coffee. Boozy, warming, and just a little syrupy. Strong roast character. Aftertaste is beautiful. This is not an everyday beer. However, every once in a while, this is perfection in a glass. Just a note, this tastes closer to a liquor than a beer. Not a bad thing, just a note.
2013- If possible, even better a year older. The coffee has mellowed, leaving a balanced drink that is actually a little like beer. Chocolate nose is more pronounced, and actually comes through in the flavor. Slightly less boozy, still very warming. Overall, flavor is more mellowed and balanced. Phenomenal. 763 charactersCKruger, Sep 20, 2014

Almost black in color with a dark tan head that quickly disappears to leave just a small amount of lacing.  Big coffee and roasted malt with sweet bourbon and chocolate in the smell.  Taste matches the smell, roasted malt and espresso and chocolate with a bourbon finish.  Full body, silky smooth, medium carbonation.  Excellent beer, so smooth for such a high ABV. 387 charactersksimons, Sep 14, 2014

5/5  rDev +9.2%There have been a few beers that changed my whole paradigm. The first beer was Two-Hearted Ale which got me into the rabbit whole that is craft beer. The second was RR Supplication on Tap at Tria in Philadelphia. The third was Heady Topper on tap at Reservoir in Waterbury, VT. 
This beer is the fourth. BCBCS is a universe of complexity. The oakiness and bourbon shine but are not overpowering. The coffee sits extremely well in the middle of the taste. The body is perfect: not watery and thin, but not like motor oil. I enjoyed this beer until the last drop. If you can, PLEASE get a hold of this beer. I didn't think beer could be this exquisite. 651 charactersGvsccraftbeer, Sep 11, 2014

5/5  rDev +9.2%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Pure bliss in a bottle. Above and beyond so many other beers. Heavy coffee flavor blends so well with the barrel aged stout flavor in this offering. Ages gracefully. 2014 version was great. 2012 version even better in my opinion. 2012 had smoother heavier coffee flavor while 2014 had more of a bite or coffee acidity to it. Any year at any age though is fabulous!
2015: On tap. Compared with 2014. Still good, but disappointing compared to other offerings. Overall would give it a 4.2. 487 charactersKevinpitts, Sep 07, 2014

4.75/5  rDev +3.7%A: Thick and black, this is dark but has a light head to it. 
S: This smells of bourbon, chocolate and a bit of coffee
T: Bourbon and chocolate combine into something very good. The first thing you taste is light bourbon and then come chocolate a little coffee. A decent sweet coffee aftertaste, but not as big as I would of thought.
M: This is thick and sweet
O: I really like this beer but I honestly thought it would be better somehow. I have had BCBS and loved it so I figured adding coffee would take this thing up a lot but I am a little underwhelmed with the lack of coffee taste. 591 charactersbarhoc11, Sep 06, 2014

3.95/5  rDev -13.8%2013 release poured into a goblet
Appearance: Thick, dark, dark brown- essentially black once poured. It's only translucent for the first 1/8 of the pour, then it sucks the light out of the room. Head is very minimal, tan as expected, but dissipates very quickly. Would have liked a frothier head. Rating: .7
Smell: Chocolate, tobacco, bourbon, sweet candied fruit. Smells like grandma handed me an old, unwashed bourbon glass filled with dried fruit or maybe candy raisins, and bitter chocolate. But not unpleasant. I barely picked up any coffee, maybe a touch of cold press coffee aroma. Rating: .75
Taste: Oh wow- berry on the finish. Usually I'd start with the first thing that hits me, but just beginning to type this beer got very, very tart. Definitely in line with some of the fruitier pour over coffee's I've had. The start of this beer is all stout, then bourbon, then coffee. You do get a good amount of sweetness, but luckily for me it was muted compared to BCBS. Just had Raisin on tap at the GI tasting room and man do these beers taste similar. As it warms in the glass the coffee takes over, relieving your palate from some of the sweetness. Rating: 1.0
Mouthfeel:  Cloying and thick. Sticks to the roof of your mouth and your palate and your cheeks. You'll want a glass of water alongisde this one. Rating: .65
Overall: When I look at BA coffee stouts, I compare how three things come together. First, where does the stout shine through, second, how does the coffee compliment the stout, and third, what was pulled from the barrel and how is that affecting the first two elements. The stout element gets a bit lost here, as the coffee has a strong fruity/berry essence that dominates. The bourbon is well balanced between the two dominant flavors (sweet malts and bitter, fruity coffee). It definitely benefits from warming in the glass. Rating: .85

4.25/5  rDev -7.2%2013 Release - Intelligentsia ‘Los Inmortales’; 12 oz bottle.
I've noticed over the years that many, if not most of the top-rated beers on sites such as this are difficult to obtain.  Given that, I wonder if the great beers are scarce because they are great, or if they are great because they are scarce.  This weekend I managed to get a 4-pack of the 2013 BC Coffee Stout, and I figured I'd be able to start answering the question.
The place that I found the BC answered part of my question; they said that they only received a single case of BC Coffee Stout in 2013.  This gibes with what I've read about the limited production of the BC series.
Appearance:  Very dark, so brown that it was almost black.  The head was minimal and dissipated very quickly.  Light carbonation. Oily, perhaps?  So far, so good.
Smell:  Coffee, light bourbon smell, maybe a couple of other notes.  Alcohol content of the beer was evident in the smell.
Taste:  My favorite, "go to" coffee stout is made by the Imperial Java Stout by Santa Fe Brewing.  For comparison, the BC stout is nearly as "coffee forward" as the Imperial Java.   The coffee flavor does hit up front, but it is a little mellower than the Imperial Java.  Its a good, solid coffee flavor, and it tastes like real coffee.  Definite bourbon flavors, and I could note some chocolate.  The alcohol flavor was noticeable.  Maybe some vanilla on the finish.
Mouthfeel:  Very intense.  Somewhat "chewy", or thick.  This is a sipping beer.
Overall:  I liked the brew.  In the class of high-alcohol Imperial Stouts (well, I guess there really aren't any low-alcohol Imperial Stouts), it is certainly a stand-out.  Nice complex flavor and the coffee notes were just about right.  Good finish; the product is well-rounded.  Definitely a beer to sip for special occasions, and not something I'd put on a "go to" list, even if it was easier to find.  Despite this site's notes about smoking and tasting, I fired up a "1990 Vintage" Rocky Patel for the last third of my glass.  The beer holds up well to a good cigar, which in my experience is unusual. 2,099 charactersVeeblefetzer, Aug 31, 2014

Pitch black with a thick finger of brown head. Falls to a ring and sticks around a while. 
Omg. Roasty coffee, sweet chocolate, vanilla, slight bourbon and wood and coconut.
Big full bodied with some lighter carbonation. Get some bourbon burn and flavor. Plenty of coffee, chocolate, vanilla.

The beer was nice and dark, mouthfeel was amazing as with all bourbon county beers, nice and thick almost like a milkshake...
Taste was more similar to reg bourbon county stout as the coffee had faded a bit, but I feel like thats why this beer shined..with 1-2 years on this beer this was perfectly balanced (but this is coming from a guy that isn't a huge coffee stout fan)

A&S: Dark black colored beer, oily residue on the top, likely from the added coffee. Head doesn't hang around all that much, but when it was present it was a light brown color. Very deep black coffee tones, smells like straight chilled black coffee. The aroma hangs out at the same level the whole tasting.
T&M: Not the most complex or evolving beer. I expected the potent coffee tones to mellow and for the beer to develop into this grand mixture of black coffee, dark chocolates, toffee, etc. However this flavors didn't really come to fruition. Boozy whiskey tones were also present. The taste stayed dominated by coffee the whole way through, it gave way a bit but not really all that much. Body was full and on the creamy side, carbonation was low.
Overall: I don't think it was the aging condition, because the goose island barleywine was superb, so I have no clue. Don't get me wrong this beer is still an very excellent beer I just wouldn't put it was the 2nd highest ranking beer on BA. 1,127 charactersminterro, Jul 31, 2014

The head is a brown-colored one about a finger tall. Retention is good, and it manages some good lacing despite the oils.
Coffee! Lots of fresh coffee, just-roasted grounds all in the nose and mouth. It's the forefront, but it lets the stout express itself all the same. There's lots of dark cocoa, and the bourbon barrel makes its way in softly but firmly with notes of vanilla and wood while offering just a little heat. The wood is dry and oaky, not a soft wood by any means. The coffee is just so rich and full, especially in the nose. It's like drinking a shot of espresso while sniffing a cup of fresh grounds right next to it after putting a little of very rich chocolate sauce, fresh made from cocoa beans, while having a snifter of bourbon right next to it.
The body is full, rich and thick, but it evens and lightens out in a surprising way, certainly more than I expect. I also can feel a certain oiliness to the grounds on the tongue. It's a good stout, and plenty rich, but it could be cleaner. 1,136 charactersBrenden, Jul 24, 2014

Opaque, black elixir, thin mocha rim, swirls of lacing, and legs all day.
Coffee, toffee/caramel, char, earth tones, dark fruits, bourbon.
Bourbon first, coffee all throughout, thick, dark fruits and chocolate. Yum!
Heavy, thick, tasty, coats the mouth.
Wonderful coffee stout, complex, keeps bringing forth enticing, blended flavors that are unique to the style and keep this brew in a class by itself. 454 charactersCaptCleveland, Jul 24, 2014

Nice pour, pitch black, small tan head.
Smells mostly of Bourbon and dark malts, some dark fruit, a small veggie note, and the fresh coffee isn't as strong as i expected.
That changes in the taste. Starts quite acidic with strong coffee and boozy raisin. Mellows down a bit after the initial sip, coffee gets roastier, some sweet spices, vanilla and nice barrel notes show up, clearer rich dark chocolate. Very clear Bourbon on the palate, packing a bit too much booze, but that's explainable (14.3 abv). Strong coffee in, strong coffee out in the aftertaste, with a touch of roasted malts and dark fruit.
Perfect for a sipper, especially because the booze doesn't seem to mellow down too fast.
Big on the coffee and barrel notes, it didn't quite live up to its huge hype. A monster RIS anyway, no need to be biased here. 835 charactersdcmchew, Jul 21, 2014

Big bourbon notes in the aroma, carrying chocolate, vanilla, and yes, some coffee in the background. Perhaps slightly less bourbon-forward than fresh BCBS.
The flavor definitely lives up to the aroma, with a big dose of BCBS deliciousness: tons of chocolate, bourbon, and vanilla; some oak warmth and dark fruit; and very smooth, very noticeable coffee.
Silky and thick mouthfeel; not quite chewy, but very full for a BA stout (typical, however, of the Bourbon County series, which have impressively thick mouthfeels). Definitely quite a bit of alcohol heat on the back-end; it's not quite possible to perfectly hide 13+% ABV. Lovely feel in the mouth: lively with no sting, really allowing you to savor this sipper.
Another fabulous BC series beer by GI. I'd love to try this a little fresher, but even ~8 months after the release, there's still a nice dose of coffee left. On my initial impression, I may prefer the regular BCBS more. 1,085 charactersRoguer, Jul 17, 2014

A: The only way you could tell this beer apart from motor oil by looking at it is because of the espresso colored head that is slightly left around the glass. This beer looks menacing in a glass!
S: My favorite part about the smell is how strong it is! A lot of stouts don't have a strong lingering smell, but this one constantly smells like it does when your first poured it. Initial smell you get this strong, but perfectly balanced blend of espresso and bourbon. Then chocolate comes in along with some booze, vanilla, and caramel. This beer smells fantastic!
T: This is an espresso bomb! Loads of espresso blended with milk and dark chocolates, some vanilla, booze, bourbon, and slight hints of caramel and toasted coconut. The espresso is superbly balanced with all the other sweet flavors that it doesn't make this beer overly sweet. All the flavors compliment each other superbly, this beer is the real deal and I can see why it gets all this hype!
M: This is probably one of the craziest mouth feels for a stout I've ever had. It is thick and sticky like syrup, but the espresso quickly dries your mouth leaving more of a dry finish than a cloyingly sweet and sticky mouthfeel. The best part about it though is you get a wonderful espresso, chocolate, coconut taste that lingers for awhile and it is awesome!
O: I can see why this beer is rated at number 2, absolutely amazing beer, you have to try this one! 1,534 charactersKnowYourCraft, Jul 14, 2014

A - pours a nice thick, black as night, liquid into a snifter with a very thin head. Dark, luscious, opaque and no lacing. 
S - dark chocolate, figs, raisins and rich caramel. Some glimpses of bourbon and faint coffee as well. All great scents for this stout. 
T - smooth as silk as it goes down with heavy dark chocolate, toffee, caramel and hints of malts. Not much coffee taste which was a bit disappointing. But the other favors make up for that just a bit. 
M - silky smooth with light carbonation.
O - a great stout. I miss the coffee notes however. Still damn good! 594 charactersbrstls4drmrs, Jul 13, 2014

Appearance - Pours nearly 2 fingers of deep cinnamon colored foam, the body is an opaque black, no highlights, no light passes through. The head comes down to a cap in the first few minutes. Very little lacing is left behind, which is nearly expected with a higher ABV beer.
Smell - Rich sweet smooth bourbon, ripe dark fruit, rich brewed dark coffee, dark toffee, molasses, bakers chocolate, roasted malt, dark soy, and honestly a whiff of roasted coconut.
Taste - Oh my goodness... very rich and creamy roast coffee flavored with semi-sweet dark chocolate and bourbon. But there is so much more... hints of black licorice, black cherry, amaretto, dark molasses, deep purple grape skin and plum skin, and near the end a wonderful oakiness begins to rise up and dry the palate slightly, now throw in some dried vanilla bean.
Mouthfeel - A very full mouthfeel, creamy smooth and mouth coating, the weight is just kept in check with a smooth foaming carb that has wonderful prickly edges at the sides and back of the tongue. The bourbon also works nicely to offset this beer from feeling too heavy, but believe me, there is some heft here. A perfect sipper, with a very complimentary heat.
Overall - Just delicious. Every sip makes me smile. There is alot of flavor here, and you can pick every one of them out if you take your time. The heft and the heat play so well with all of these flavors, and the bourbon and oak seems to accentuate it all. Pick up a bottle if you come across one, you will not be disappointed.

4.35/5  rDev -5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4.25I such a huge fan of coffee stouts especially when Bourbon is involved. I was really looking forward to this one, so its gonna be hard for me to be impartial.
Poured into a snifter like 3000 mile used motor oil blackness. Impenetrably dark in body. Head is a milk chocolate brown inch and a half of fuzzy, crackling bubbles. The head fades very quickly leaving no lace and only a skim around the edges of the glass. Attractive body, but the head retention is a bit of a letdown.
Nose is full of rich fresh opened coffee. Deep and rich with only a hint of bourbon twinge on the backside of the nose. Some caramelized notes come through as the beer warms.
Enters the mouth very rich and super thick. Black coffee and bourbon bite all over the tongue. Coffee feel is very well done and nicely full and rich. Bourbon is sweet and plays second fiddle to the coffee here. There is a nice balance taking place on the palate of this beer with maple, dark fruit and rich coffee dipped bourbon cake.
The mouthfeel is very thick, absolutely coating the entire mouth, especially as the bottle comes to its end and only a few sips remaining.
Overall a very good brew, but not necessarily worth a top 5 ranking in my opinion. 1,216 charactersSPLITGRIN, Jul 01, 2014

4.85/5  rDev +5.9%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.752013 Edition: It poured a deep brown to black with a slight to no tan head. The aroma hit me straight out of the bottle of coffee, heavy stout and bourbon. The taste was otherworldly. A perfect blend of the base stout that exuded bittersweet chocolate and a deep roasty flavor with the coffee and the bourbon barrel characteristics. As it warmed the bourbon booziness came out as well as a stronger coffee tone that was akin to espresso. Hints of vanilla and charred oak emerged and really capped off a world class beer. 520 charactersbrurevu, Jun 26, 2014

A- Pours black with a little brown to tan head
S- Coffee, bourbon, malt and touch of chocolate.
T- coffee and chocolate announce themselves quickly, though a mineral element lingers on the tail. It improves as it warms a bit with deeping complexities of said flavored and cherry-bourbon notes.
M- Thick and minimal right carbonation
O- My first. Looking forward to another w/ some age on it. The mineral afternote was not to my liking, though my friend rather enjoyed the novelty. I prefer the original and some other variants. 589 charactershillvt4me, Jun 14, 2014
4.89/5  rDev +6.8%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Opened today on Friday the 13th.
Appearance- The beer pours blacker then black. Minimal mocha head that dissipates to nothing. Looks like really old used motor oil. In a good way. 
Smell - The smell is heavenly. Strong roasted coffee soaked in bourbon. Roasted malt with hints of chocolate and vanilla.
Taste - In your face coffee. This will wake you up. Coffee is followed by bourbon, cocoa, roasted malt. Some oak. It ends with a sweet bourbon flavor. All the flavors compliment each other with nothing being more dominant than the coffee. Beautifully done. 
Mouthfeel - Thick and creamy. Coats your mouth. Minimal carbonation. 
Overall - I'm not one to gush over a beer but this is an outstanding coffee stout. Top notch and memorable. 743 charactersSpaten454, Jun 13, 2014

A - Jet Black, Tan Head. Flawless appearance, as if entering the abyss.
S - Breathtaking aroma, ran out of breathe and nearly went light headed from smelling the intense Intelligentsia coffee pouring out of this brew. I think for a standard barrel aged stout, BCBS is perfect and this adds the perfect amount of any additional flavor: Coffee.
T - Bursting with coffee, bourbon, oat, roasted coffee beans. Once again flawless.
M - Coats the mouth and tongue with a typical BCBS mask. Sublte carbonation played well with the bourbony and coffee flavors.
Overall - 99.9/100%. 2nd only to Vanilla Bean DL in my opinion. Cant wait to freeze my ass off on Black Friday and try to get 2014's batch. 854 charactersHesscabob, Jun 13, 2014

A- pours jet black, thick and creamy. Small mocha head, little lacing. Not much carbonation noticeable and looks like a still, dark and muddy lake.
S- nose is fresh coffee grinds and top shelf bourbon up front. Lots of dark roasted malts and barley behind it, as well as mocha, dark chocolates, and vanilla. Hints of syrup, tobacco, and oak in the distance. Alcohol present.
T- definitely a huge beer and not for the lighthearted. Bourbon is noticeable immediately, as is the coffee. Very well balanced with the fired malts. Very rich and creamy. Chocolate and toffee are present in the sweetness of this stout. Small hint of oak and wood and alcohol noticeable.
M- thick, rich, and creamy. Full bodied and bold. Touch of sticky syrup adds to the feel of this. Not much carbonation and this was served at just the right temperature, which shouldn't be too chilled, but a little less than room temp.
O- top notch barrel aged stout. They don't get much better than this. Perfect for breakfast or that final night cap. Very rich and creamy. The bourbon, coffee, and chocolate work great with the malts. Love this in winter with a good pipe or cigar and a nice fire going. Truly a gentleman's drink. A must on any stout lover's list. 1,273 charactersEveningCordial, Jun 11, 2014

Appearance: Jet black in color, almost like a thickened cola. Very little brown head. Very little lacing.
Smell: Boozy with pronounced bitter coffee scent with some vanilla cocoa notes.
Taste: Strong coffee flavor with noticeable cocoa flavor. Almost like a double or triple tall mocha flavor (using my former Starbucks drink as an analogy). However, not as sweet as last year's offering. Boozy for a 13% beer.
Mouthfeel: Thick, full bodied. The taste hangs around in your mouth.
Overall: Coffee BCS will always rank among my top 5 beers. This version, compared to 2012 and 2011, is not as sweet as 2012 but not good enough to beat the 2011 version (which I believe was their best version to date). 898 charactersBRami127, Jun 09, 2014

A: Obsidian black. Almost as if you're staring into darkness inside a glass. Forms maybe a half finger of khaki-colored head with crystalline lacing. Very pretty.
S: An abundance of coffee, followed by vigorous notes of bourbon. Roasted malts, faint hint of rolled oats.
T: Coffee, coffee, and more coffee! Again, followed by sweet bourbon. The bitter coffee taste melds well with the bourbon -- not overly boozy, and not overly sweet, almost like drinking black coffee with the perfect amount of simple syrup... and bourbon.
M: Thick and viscous. Carbonation is minimal, as typical of barrel-aged stouts. Love the way this stout wraps around your tongue and leaves you wanting for more.
O: Quite possibly the best representation of its style. Like a cup of rich coffee, this tasty brew is best enjoyed one sip at a time. 863 charactersamano_h, Jun 08, 2014

A black liquid with a deep cola edge, a finger of foam fizzes out in seconds leaving no lace, some wide legs and leaves a little color on the glass
S plenty of bourbon barrel with char and vanilla being hard to miss, then you get hit with the coffee, strong and dark roasted, I'm loving the coffee on the nose, licorice and chocolate syrup mingle with a blast of booze
T somehow there's even more coffee then the nose, more like espresso and its strong and burnt but that's how I like it. lots of charred wood, vanillas still strong, boozy for sure but to be expected at 13.4%, plenty of bourbon going on, its like they brewed coffee using bourbon instead of water and then added some burnt barrel 
M thick but not as thick as expected, creams up and heat hits my chest more then the throat, just a little sticky on the lips and very intense dark roast lingers, very strong aftertaste just keeps going
O great beer, the coffee plays a big role and the bourbon barrel helps the cause, a little boozy but I'm not sure if I'd age it out to mellow because I wouldn't want the coffee to fade, tough call
picks me up while putting me down, caffeine and booze always gives me a strange sensation, wouldn't be my first choice for a night cap. A great mix of barrel and dark roasted coffee, I'd love to be able to get my hands on this stuff on a regular basis. 1,479 characterswordemupg, Jun 08, 2014

S: 4.5 Earthy, dark roasted coffee, vanilla, caramel, and dark berries. The coffee is big, but there's a lot going on behind it. A bit of the barrel shows up when the beer is a bit warmer. 
T: 4.5 Lots of dark roasted coffee with light bitterness. Dark berries, some vanilla, and a good amount of bittersweet chocolate follow closely behind the coffee. As the beer warms, the bourbon starts to come through with even more chocolate and some raspberries. Aftertaste leaves a really nice, fresh ground coffee flavor, it's actually quite a bit different than the initial coffee flavor. 
M: 4.5 Fairly thick with little carbonation, though just enough to keep the beer lively. Drinks very easily with a slightly dry finish. 
O: 4.5 Probably the best coffee stout I've had, but I think I prefer bcbs over the coffee version. While very, very good, I wish there was more from the barrel like the original. 957 charactersTele, Jun 06, 2014

4.97/5  rDev +8.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Bottle date 11/15/13. Pours pitch black with a 1/2 finger caramel-colored head that dissipates quickly. Nose is coffee spiciness/bitterness combined with sweetness from the base beer. Just a phenomenal nose that evokes the finest coffee liqueur imaginable. Taste is sweetness & coffee beany up front. Spiciness all around, particularly toward the back of the mouth. Oak in the mix too, of course. The finish alone has more complexity than the entire experience of most beers: coffee spice, bitterness, sweetness reminiscent of maple and molasses, oak. So many flavors that fit together so well. Mouthfeel is a thick, almost syrupy consistency. Well-carbonated. Overall it's a phenomenal beer that never fails to impress, year after year. Regular Bourbon County Stout is awesome, and it's hard to believe anything could improve upon it. But that's exactly what coffee does: substantially improves upon a near perfect beer. 921 charactersfoobula, Jun 03, 2014

A. Poors near-to pitch black, with a thin beige head that disappears quickly. 
S. Lots of espresso coffee and roasted malt. Some bourbon, booze, and hints of tannine. 
T. Kicks in quite bitter with lots of espresso coffee, chocolate and roasted malts. Then the bourbon kicks in; lots of vanilla, oak, tannine en some dark fruits in the back. The typical BCBS taste gets through at this point.
Finish lasts long, and also adds a little booze to the aftertaste which is absolutely not disturbing. Taste is really thick, bombastic, and surely more bitter and coffee-forward than a lot of other coffee stouts I have had thus far. Amazing.
M. Very creamy mouthfeel, thick body. suits the beer perfectly.
O. One of the best beers I have drank thus far. Amazingly bombastic coffee stout with big taste en perfect mouthfeel. I really like BCBS but this adds that big coffee taste to allready phenomenal original beer. 
I drank a 2011 vintage 2 months ago, and I recommend to drink this beer fresh if you prefer that strong, bitter coffee up front. 1,108 charactersMikeReserva, Jun 01, 2014

4.39/5  rDev -4.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Reviewed from notes. Had on-tap at Datz Deli. Served in a large brandy glass.
A: Very dark brown, opaque except along the tangential edges of the glass. Forms a small tan head with very low visible carbonation.
S: Bourbon, oak, vanilla, some alcohol heat…and not nearly the amount of coffee that I expected. There's some, but almost the amount you'd expect from the roasted malt character. NOTE: This does increase as it warms during the (slow) drink.
T: Bourbon-forward, oak tannins, vanilla, with coffee lurking underneath the other huge flavors here. Some mild chocolate flavors from the malts comes out as it warms. Finishes with sweet malts and lingering bourbon. 
M: Sticky mouthfeel but only a medium body. Low carbonation sensation. The alcohol flavors play huge into the drink, but the heat from the hefty ABV is well-hidden.
O: Good for sure, but I'm not completely wowed by any means. While none of the Bourbon County beers would be noted for their subtlety, I was surprised at how much the coffee flavors were beaten into submission by the other huge flavors here. NOTE: Had the '13 version a few days later from the 12 oz. bottle. While substantially the same experience, the coffee was more noticeable from the beginning, the bourbon was more integrated, and was on the whole a better drink. Scores reflect the improved experience. 1,352 charactersmacrosmatic, May 27, 2014

Tasted very much like the smell, the coffee overpowering but still tamed at the same time, I would like to try this after letting it age for ~3 years to let let coffee mellow out some. Malty, chocalatey and notes of bourbon followed. Simply delicious and surprisingly did taste as hot as I thought it would but you could still tell it was north of 10%. 567 charactersZilaniz, May 24, 2014

A- Jet black with little to no tan head
S- Coffee and bourbon, mostly bourbon. The booze smell definitely dominates, not my favorite aroma in a beer.
T- Obviously the coffee hits you as well as the chocolate. First few drinks out of the fridge at a lower ~40/45F give off more of the bourbon flavor. It improves as it warms to a 50/55 temp and blends in better with the other flavors.
M- Thick and just right carbonation, nothing to complain about here
O- An awesome beer for sure. Again my only complaint is the very strong bourbon presence, but this is what you get with most Bourbon County beers as well as a lot of other BA beers. I plan to try it again with a few more months on it to see if the booziness melds in a little better with age. 805 characterslinnymtu, May 23, 2014

Appearance- Not quite pitch black, but one tiny step up from that. TONS of carbonation! "Paper bag" brown 3/4 inch head that disappears right away. 
Smell- Sweet, roasty smoke blasts you up front. Coffee and vanilla are present but take a back seat. Bourbon is detectable, but very faint. 
Taste- WOW!!! Perfect in every way. Smokey vanilla is the most present, but then the flavors flood your taste buds. Bourbon, coffee and oak in that order. There is a pleasant sweetness that is not at all cloying. 
Mouthfeel- Sweet and spicy at once. This beer feels a bit thin for the style. It feels like it just disappears as soon as you sip it. Leaves your mouth fairly dry after the swallow. 
Overall- World-class beer that should be sought out whenever possible. One of the major ways I rate beers is if I would trade for them. I would trade for this beer. 938 charactersfrenchblood21, May 17, 2014

Big rummy chocolate mocha nose with several layers. Espresso-soaked ladyfingers, fudge brownie, thick dark caramel, vanilla extract, slam dunk roast barley, whiskey, faint herbal notes, and black licorice. Awesome, awesome nose.
Espresso cookies, fudgy chocolate cake, high end bourbon, roast bitterness, buttery vanilla liqueur, coffee bean earthiness, chiming impy booze, wilting hop, gooey toffee, and more brownie. Phenomenal stuff.
Thick gluggy mouth with some syrupy aftershocks. Sprite carb wants to burn embers and act a little prickly. Let it. The body is immense enough for all.

It is basically a variation of the other bourbon county stout, except this one has coffee added. It is a very dark glass of beer, and Goose Island made sure they wanted to differentiate the Bourbon County brand. This one smell like coffee, and strongly. It also taste a lot like coffee, you can the similarities and differences very clearly. This one smells like coffee, it is not sweet at all, and may even be a bit acidic.

A: Oily black with cherry notes along the rim. No head. Light lacing.
S: Coffee swats you in the face with a bourbon/vanilla backbeat. A great olfactory sensation.
T: Overwhelmingly good. Even with a slow sip, this killer brew dominates with bourbon, vanilla, chocolate and a lower coffee taste than I was expecting. Like the perfect lover: slow, insistent, full of flavor and an assertiveness that knows no bounds. Alcohol heat rises with every taste. Let it warm for maximum enjoyment.
M: Medium with medium, chewy carbonation.
O: I'm in love. Should've picked up more. Chances like these are few and far between. A true work of art that measures up to the regular Bourbon County Brand Stout. Recommended, encouraged and yelled though a megaphone: "Damn! Seek and enjoy!" 866 charactersbrewskifan55, May 05, 2014

Pours a very dark brown with thick tan head. 
Smell is absolutely amazing. Very big coffee with hits of chocolate, and hints of bourbon. Smell is a lot like hershy chocolate. Smell is so big I can literally smell this beer from some distance. 
Taste, OH MY GOD!... this is so freaking awesome. It is every thing this style of beer should be. I'm honored to drink this superb beer. Every flavor is perfectly balance out. Truly unbelievable.

A: Pours completely opaque. Not much head, but it is a nice tan color. Great legs. 4.50
S: Coffee smell has depleted-17 months since bottling. Just smells like a rich and savory bourbon barrel stout-similar to the regular BCBS of a similar age. 4.50
T: Goes down so smooth. The only betrayal of the ABV is the slight numbness in my throat. So rich, yet no coffee remains. Bourbon flavor is strong. 4.75
M: Coats the mouth perfectly and lingers. 4.75
2013 12oz poured into a Huna sniffer on 4.29.2014.
 A: Same as the 2012. Pours completely opaque. Not much head, but it is a nice tan color. Great legs. 4.50
S: Lot of coffee! Five months since bottling. 4.75
T: Slightly acidic. Bourbon flavor muted. Really rich and savory. 4.75

A - Black with a 1-finger tan head that fades quickly and leaves almost no lacing.
S - Chocolate, some coffee, rich, high-quality bourbon, vanilla, molasses, dark fruit. Luscious.
T - Lots of alcohol/bourbon, milk chocolate, oak, vanilla, coffee, coconut, dried cherry, fig, molasses, rock candy. Aftertaste is molasses, bourbon, raisin, roasted malt sweetness and bitterness and alcohol.
M - Medium-heavy body and light carbonation. Substantial, moderately creamy/syrupy. 
O - I like it a little better than the BCBS. It's not a coffee forward brew like a Founders Breakfast Stout, despite the name. I like Parabola and the 2013 KBS a bit better, but this is a lofty stout that made my day today. My wife enjoyed it too. 792 charactersTucquan, Apr 27, 2014

4.01/5  rDev -12.4%look: 3.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Currently #2 in the Top 250 beer list. Expectations are accordant. 12 fl oz brown glass bottle with classy red label and branded black pry-off pressure cap purchased at an Austin, TX bottle shop and side-poured into an Adelbert's stem-tulip at low altitude. Reviewed live alongside a 2013 BCBS. Reviewed as a "Stout Aged in Bourbon Barrels with Coffee Added." "13.4%" ABV - lower than 2013 BCBS, strangely. "Bottled 15BOV13."
Served at fridge temp and allowed to warm over the course of the review.
No bubble show forms as it's poured.
HEAD: Half winger wide. Tan colour. Complexion isn't as shiny as regular BCBS. Recedes fully inside 15 seconds, leaving no lacing. Pretty disappointing, but excusable at this high an ABV.
BODY: Predictable opaque solid black. Not quite a jet black. No yeast particulate or hop sediment is visible.
Appears aptly carbonated. I've seen far better appearances in beers of this style and this isn't unique or special looking, but I'm optimistic. There are no egregious flaws.
AROMA: The dominant rich coffee/java stands out - subtle roast, rich grounds, just a full lovely character with a kiss of bitter espresso. 
The dark & chocolate malts are obscured by the bourbon tones; I get vanilla and oak, but unfortunately the oak isn't really toasty like in Backwoods Bastard. Not a wood-y beer either, which I like.
I crave roasted barley, but it's nowhere to be found. I'm also not getting much in the way of cream or caramel. The coconut featured so well in regular 2013 BCBS is also absent.
Molasses. Light faint char and burnt barrel. A hint of marshmallow.
It's a pleasant inviting aroma suggestive of a sticky and sweet flavour profile. Merely moderate in strength, it's not the overbearing booze-bomb you might expect at this high an ABV.
TEXTURE: Smooth and wet. I'd prefer more coarseness and dryness, which would be best accomplished with more roasted barley. It's a biteen syrupy and sticky, but is less so than regular 2013 BCBS. It has a kiss of harshness on the back end, which actually works well with the burnt roast of the coffee beans. Aptly carbonated for a cellar-worthy stout. Plenty of heft and weight here, which backs the diverse flavour profile well. Full-bodied and understandably thick. Fairly soft, actually. Approachable for a high-ABV sipper. Overall presence on the palate is very good. This texture complements the taste well.
Not oily, gushed, hot, boozy, biting, or astringent.
TASTE: The coffee notes stand out at the expense of the coconut featured in regular 2013 BCBS. Not as roasty (in terms of both coffee and barley) as I'd hoped for, but the coffee does bring a nice full java character to the mix, with a kiss of bitter espresso in there too. Far from the best coffee character I've experienced in an imperial stout, but it's pretty well executed.
The core is what you'd expect if you've had 2013 BCBS - molasses, dark malts, chocolate malts, maybe some caramel. There's also a slight hint of anise/fennel, which works surprisingly well here, if only because it's reticent. Marshmallow, sure.
I can see where some might pick up on a narrow fruit profile - perhaps cherry or even grape - particularly in the late second act and on the finish, but it's pretty tame.
The coconut, char, and burnt character get buried here.
Then there's the bourbon barrel. Seamlessly integrated vanilla and oak tones really set off the notes of the base beer. It never veers into the spicy territory of regular whisky, and never comes off boozy or hot.
I've had richer imperial stouts, but ultimately the balance and subtlety here is damned impressive. It's not the most complex or intricate stout on the market, but boy does it layer its notes well. I'd almost say it's a gestalt flavour profile, but then I remember that it could use more roasted barley.
Flavour depth could definitely be better. This is a nitpick, but I feel like the 2013 vintages just don't have the depth or complexity of past vintages. Above average flavour duration and intensity.
Overall, I really like it.
FINAL THOUGHTS: It's not the best coffee imperial stout out there, nor is it the best barrel aged imperial stout out there, and I doubt the base is all that great. But all of the minor notes and little touches combine to create an incredibly satisfying beer that every discerning drinker should try. I'd absolutely pick it up again, and I can see why it has its #2 ranking, but it's far from amongst the best 10 beers I've ever had. Certainly better than regular 2013 BCBS, but not impeccable. This gets me extremely excited to try the other variants. This is the best work I've seen from Goose Island aside from 2009 and 2012 BCBS, and I'm glad I got my paws on 2 bottles this year. Not real drinkable; she's a sipper alright.
A-
***
03.12.15: Brief notes for a bottle with a few months of age:
Heavy on coffee and roastiness. Dark malts. Chocolate malts. Great balance.
Highly drinkable and tasty even aged.

4.86/5  rDev +6.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Drinking a cellar temp bottle aged in my basement for 3 years. This is a 2010 vintage so used Black Cat Espresso beans for the flavoring. The beer pours a dark oil black with fizzy and fluffy tan head of 2 cm even with a gentle pour. The head recedes slowly to a sturdy edge layer.
The edge layer is even sticking around on the end of the tasting.
The aroma is rich and malty with bourbon and vanilla notes, I also get some booze and just a little bit of a swiss mocha hit with the coffee and chocolate mix. The nose is very appealing and has an overall sweet and appealing aroma, very enticing scents.
First sip reveals a silky smooth body with cask like carbonation that gently rolls across my palate and is almost non-existent.
Flavor is sweet mocha, bourbon notes, again some vanilla and a bit of dry wooden notes like a toothpick. The booze is present but not by any means the focus of this beer. There is a little black pepper astringency on the finish that I attribute to alcohol not hops, which I dont find in any noticeable presence.
The beer goes down very easily and could be very dangerous with the 13% tagline on the label.
This is a complex, interesting malty brew that i wish I had another 6 bottles of in the cellar, I would definitely buy more of these if I ever see them anywhere.
Quite a nice brew to enjoy this evening.
IF you have one drink it now. 1,369 characterssulldaddy, Apr 27, 2014

This is the only BCBCS I've had to date. Pours thick black with only the slightest bit of deep brown around the edges when held in the light. Thick and a touch oily for sure. Slight brown head with very little retention. Intense coffee in the aroma. You can easily pickup the strength of the alcohol in the aroma, strong bourbon, hints of vanilla, and tobacco. The coffee is up front as I was hoping for. Still very sweet but a bit toned down from BCBS, which is a huge positive for my taste, just the right amount to round out the flavors of anise, vanilla, oak, and raisin that dance and marry very poignantly.  Serious viscosity here with very little carbonation, you can almost chew on this beer. 
2014 - much more watered down than lasts years version. Some good flavors going on here, but I think I'm done supporting AB. 863 charactersPhigg1102, Apr 21, 2014

This bottle wins!
Although... Event Horizon from NC is way better in Mouth Feel and Taste.
It is kind of saddening that those beers get very little respect. If you can get an "Event Horizon" you will never feel the hype for Goose Island.
If you can get a Blendiculous #1 then you will never care about 3 floyds or Goose.

S: It has a very wonderful aroma. Bourbon, oak, coffee, cocao, and a promise of wonderful flavors. It's fantastic.
T: It has a nice well-balanced flavor of bourbon and spiced wood along with rich malty chocolate flavor and coffee. It's amazing. There's few words I could use to describe this beer without talking in circles. It's something a person would have to experience. There is a hint of alcohol that looms in the rafters, but it's so far in the background that it does no harm to the flavor. The aftertaste is exactly what you'd get out of a cup o' Joe. It is very lovely.
M: It has a nearly perfect mouthfeel. The body is nice and full, smooth, robust without being a hindrance. The only downfall I notice is the severe lack of carbonation.
O: Overall it is a quite wonderful beer that lacks only in the carbonation. I would gladly buy this beer again, and would happily recommend it to others. There's precious little to be said about perfection, but this does quite well in embodying it. Bourbon lovers, stout enthusiasts, and coffee scrutineers will all be proud to have a bottle of this close by. 1,254 charactersteromous, Apr 15, 2014

A: Pitch black with no head, collar or anything outside of the liquid. Slight mocha head on a vigorous pour of what I had left., left an ok collar. Dissipated right away.
S: Sweet malts with a a nice earthy coffee flavor, like freshly ground coffee beans. Just a bit of bourbon mingling around the edges.
T: The last time I had BCBS was on Black Friday, but this is just like I remember with just some slight changes. Bourbon on the backend with just a slight bit of a burn. Very warming. I let it warm up quite a bit. The coffee is primarily on the backend and dulls the bourbon a bit, just soaks it up. Coffee just does a good job in balancing this out a bit, at least with fresh BCS.
M: Smooth for the most part with just a few rough patches of coarse bubbles/carbonation. However, it does seem to have close to the same body of a good bourbon, it feels like you mixed some with it. Like it is oily almost.
O: I only got two other bottles, so I will either save them or bring them to bottleshares. It is just too much bourbon for me. 1,104 charactersgillagorilla, Apr 11, 2014

S: Wow. Big time coffee (no surprise there), lots of toffee and oak followed by a little vanilla and dark fruit. Get a hint of the alcohol presence on the nose as well. Very nice. 
T: Huge coffee/espresso right off the bat followed up by a vanilla / toffee sweetness. The oaky, bourbon flavors come in at the end with a slight boozy warmth. Awesome. 
M: Thick, almost syrupy. Sticky quality that allows some of the warmth and sweetness to linger on the palate. 
O: Crazy good. So thankful I was able to try this truly awesome beer. The coffee and bourbon flavors perfectly complement one another. Incredibly smooth and enjoyable. You will have a smile on your face after every sip. 824 charactersDomD1121, Apr 06, 2014

Imperial Stout
13.4 % ABV 
APPEARANCE: Poured a midnight deep black. Very little faint toffee colored head that dissipated almost instantly leaving the smallest lace. 
AROMA: Holy Cracker Jack's, I literally just checked the bottle for my prize. The nose on this is epic, toffee, vanilla, fresh ground coffee, oak. Wow. Hints of over ripe deep dark berries. Some chocolate and a faint spiciness. 
TASTE: Right away expresso, roasted, toasted and nutty. Nice sweet malts, chocolate the ripe berries I got in the nose. Toffee, molasses and then the barrel flavor joins the party. Oak, vanilla, hint of cinnamon. Kinda happy I didn't get the spiciness I grabbed in the nose. 
MOUTHFEEL: Very rich, slick and oily. Heavy bodied with very light carbonation. Finished with a nice booziness. 
OVERALL: Amazing beer, intense and delicious. Felt it was super balanced and didn't let the coffee over power the other layers. Personally I put this right under Backyard Rye in the bcs lineup so far.

2013 Vintage; thanks to UncleJazz for the bottle!
This beers pours darker'n a black steer's tookus on a moonless prairie night with a short dark mocha head that dissipates quickly leaving minimal lacing. The nose is strong and mouthwatering and is dominated both by rich malt and boozy bourbon with notes of chocolate, espresso, vanilla, toffee and nutty oak. On the palate is big bourbon and malty toffee/caramel sweetness, dark chocolate and loads of coffee/espresso. The mouthfeel is very round, smooth, velvety and huge on the palate. I didn't know what to expect and have been dissapointed by coffee stouts in the past, but this one is just fantastic. 697 charactersmtomlins, Mar 31, 2014

5/5  rDev +9.2%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I poured this one (bottled Nov. 2013) into a Bourbon County snifter. It's dark with the thinnest of heads. A bit foamy at first, but the head is gone, never to be seen again, after about 5 minutes. Looks oily and viscous. The nose is incredible: roasted espresso beans that have been soaked in bourbon. Heavy amounts of roast, espresso, and sweet bourbon vanilla. My god. Taste follows the nose, then hammers it out of the park: equal parts iced espresso and bourbon. Both flavors are there, and neither overpowers the other: complementary. Am I drinking a bourbon-spiked espresso, or a bourbon with a shot of espresso in it? It's both of those things, and something else entirely. The booze is definitely there, warming me up but not knocking me out. Lovely vanilla marshmallows round out each sip. Mouthfeel is thick, viscous, and smooth. So luscious and decadent. Simply astonishing: the balance between the roast coffee, the heavy bourbon, and the luscious mouthfeel is out of this world. The finest beer I've ever had. I've got one BCBCS left, and I'll be enjoying it on my wedding night. It's that kind of beer. Cheers! 1,125 charactersblankenhoney, Mar 31, 2014

A minimal amount of dark khaki colored foam is barely present. I've had Founders Breakfast Stout but this coffee aroma is so strong it nearly has a physical presence. The body is thick and sticky and carries a certain weight to it. The front of the palate is brutally intense coffee and deep dark malt. 401 charactersFranziskaner, Mar 29, 2014

But it's not as amazing as I'd hoped. Sure, the Bourbon County line sets a new bar; they're the most extreme barrel aged stouts. But perhaps they're not the best, the most nuanced, or the most complex. 618 characters01001111, Mar 26, 2014

4.81/5  rDev +5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5I don't remember where I picked this one up. 12 oz. bottle with a Bottled On date of 11/15/13. I poured this into a snifter.
At first, BCBCS pours with a substantial deep tan head that lasts for a short while, crackling away audibly until it disappears almost completely. No lacing here...just a black tar pit with a single floating island of micro-bubbles. This is a black beer, with no hint of light passing through any part of the liquid. Deep and ominous.
The aroma is a beautiful and almost perfect mixture of bourbon barrels and coffee. It is a strong bouquet that shows off many qualities, including sweet vanilla, charred oak, fresh brewed coffee, alcohol soaked cherries, leather, spice, and bourbon obviously.
What is so impressive about BCBCS (and indeed, all the Bourbon County beer varieties) is the complete smooth barrel-aged quality that reduces the intense alcohol to nothing more than a slight warmth in the finish. The flavor up front is packed with heavily roasted malts, coffee, and oak barrels. Across the palate, you will pick up more of the booze, with an alcoholic note hitting the roof of the mouth. It finishes with a lingering bitterness/acrid roast that helps to create a sense of balance against the sweet, sticky body of this imperial stout. The aftertaste bring out more of the toasted oak and vanilla flavors, with some bourbon heat accompanying that taste. The body is perfect: it's full, smooth, rich, velvety, and with a perfect amount of carbonation to carry this goliath beer across the tongue and make it feel not so heavy and oily. I believe that is why a beer like this has taken the place of Dark Lord in the ratings....
A well-balanced beer can exist in any style, and here we have a well-balanced massive imperial stout brewed with coffee beans and aged in bourbon barrels. Very tough to beat this experience. Really a well crafted beer and exremely drinkable for a beer that exceeds 12% abv. Best beer in the world? Mmmm...getting closer. 1,987 charactersMusicaleMike, Mar 23, 2014

Near perfect.
First impression - slick tar body with perfectly browned marshmallow head.
The aroma is the only thing that is "short of perfect" in this one - the dark coffee stands separate from the bourbon vapors. Would have loved to sense them melding better together.
The taste, however, more than makes up for that - an absolutely remarkable balance of bitter chocolate & dark roasted coffee, accentuated by the sweet bourbon.
All that is complemented by a medium body - not too thin to feel like a compromise, not too thick to leave me wanting more! 598 charactersKostyaK, Mar 18, 2014

Poured thick and dark with barely any head.
A midnight black color doesn't let the light through. The smattering of head is light chocolate color that dissipates quickly. 
Smells of coffee and chocolate.
Tastes of chocolate and coffee with strong notes of bourbon and vanilla. Subtle hints of oak with a little char. The sweet of the chocolate and oak play nicely with bitter of the coffee and warmth of the bourbon.
Slightly slurpy on the tongue, with very light carbonation in the mouth. It has a slight alcohol bite that fades quickly.
The flavors in the beer come together superbly. It is a layered, immensely enjoyable experience. 700 charactersAbe_Froman, Mar 17, 2014

Pours dense pitch black color with a small fairly dense dark tan head with decent retention, that reduces to a ring of lace that lingers. Minimal lacing on the glass. Aromas of huge dark chocolate, roasted coffee, cocoa, roasted malt, caramel, toast, vanilla, toffee, bourbon, oak, clove, light char, and roast/oak earthiness. Incredible aromas with fantastic balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt, coffee, and bourbon barrel notes; with great strength. Taste of huge dark chocolate, roasted coffee, cocoa, toast, roasted malt, caramel, vanilla, toffee, oak, clove, bourbon, light char, and roast/oak earthiness. Lingering notes of dark chocolate, coffee, cocoa, toast, roasted malt, caramel, vanilla, toffee, oak, clove, bourbon, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity of dark/roasted malt, coffee, and bourbon barrel flavors; with a great malt/barrel flavor balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and full bodied; with a very creamy and slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic BA imperial coffee stout. All around awesome complexity and balance of dark/roasted malt, coffee, and bourbon barrel flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering. 1,418 characterssuperspak, Mar 08, 2014
4.58/5  rDev 0%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Poured a 12 oz bottle, 2013 vintage, into a mason jar. Was motor oil black, with no transparency even around the edges and almost no head to speak of except a tiny lacing of dark brown bubbles. The smell is dominated by bourbon, maple, and raisins, with little to no coffee aroma present. The taste was sweeter than I expected, with heavy raisin and maple flavor and a good slow bourbon spice on the finish. The alcohol was less pronounced than you might expect for a 13%+ ABV, but I did notice a little heat especially as it warmed up. The mouthfeel was a bit thinner than many coffee stouts, but it did leave a its mark. Overall this was a strong beer, one that grew on me as I drank it. Perhaps it didn't live up to my memory of the original BCBS, but still a very tasty beer and very easy to drink.
Edit: had 2014 and 2013 back to back in a snifter on 1/3/15.. Both poured black as night, with limited head and light lacing. Smell was dominated by dark fruit, vanilla, coffee, and dark chocolate. Taste followed suit. 2014 had more raisans, plums, and dark chocolate, while 2013 was silmilar, but had more coffee and dark chocolate bitterness. Definitely a great beer. I liked the fresh version a little more though both were great. 1,237 charactersOneEye78, Mar 08, 2014

The coffee flavors really come out on the palate but aren't overwhelming. Unlike other brews in the similar ABV range, it wasn't at all boozy or too strong. In fact you could get into trouble quick because it doesn't have the familiar bite that many +10% beers have.
It had a great mouthfeel to it. Not too thick and creamy and definitely not watery like a cheap beer. The finish is nice and strong with flavor and aroma.
Cannot wait for next year's release. 565 charactersEzbakeoven1, Mar 05, 2014

Black as tar, brown dense head that utterly disappears, thick syrup-looking viscosity. Wonderful crisp cold-pressed coffee aroma with cacao in the background, roasted malt, occasional whiffs of wood and whiskey alcohol. Taste is well proportioned with coffee bean again taking the lead including some of the its acidity. Supporting are BIG notes of dark chocolate, roasted grain that adds some bitterness but also some sweetness, touch of soy sauce, oak in the late palate that includes some whiskey spice. No hint of fusels. Long, decadent finish. Mouthfeel is much lighter than expected, not much of an oily quality, fine prickles of carbonation that add to the spice of the whiskey notes. STICKY.
Genius execution of a big, bold coffee stout. The aroma is absolutely incredible, showcasing coffee but providing a great supporting act with the roasted malt and faint whiskey barrel notes. Only flaw is the soy sauce flavor, which, while mild, I feel didn't fit in to the rest of the profile. A shortcoming in my book was the body, which I found to be thin. Otherwise, great flavor profile and great balance of all those flavors. Any critiques here are extremely picky: this beer is several levels beyond what most other beer could hope to be. 1,290 characters1000lbgrizzly, Mar 05, 2014

Pours a jet black body, 1/4 inch tan head. Lacing was above average and head retention was ok
Smell is of sweet booze, burnt malt, dark chocolate and a little coffee. For 13 percent, alcohol scent isn't too much. 
Taste is big on fudge, vanilla, bourbon soaked oak, and slightly acidic coffee. Smoky, roasted, almost burnt malts offset the sweetness nicely. As beer warms slight bourbon after burn kicks in, kinda nice for cold weather drinking. At a year old, the coffee has faded a bit, 6 months old is probably its prime drinking age. 
Mouthfeel is nice, good amount of carbonation for a beer with a thick consistency. Head died prematurely, which prevented it from being a perfect 5. 
Overall this beer holds its own with the best of them. Rich in smell, taste, and body, very hard to find a coffee stout that rivals it. Unfortunately it is becoming harder to find but I look forward to hunting down a couple bottles every year. 991 charactersangelmonster, Mar 04, 2014

s: big coffee notes. Smells like Speedway or Peche mortel. Small light berry and fusel notes from the barrel and alcohol. some sugary almond cookie as well. Very nice but not too strong.
t: Oh yes, big roasty, nutty, almond flavors swimming around. The barrel isn't that in-your-face that you get from the normal Bourbon County stout but rather well integrated. The coffee lends almost an exotic, dark, roasted berry flavor. Some sips lend more sugary, alcohol burns than others. 
mf: Medium bodied, medium carbonation. 
overall: Nothing new here, though the flavors hit me so well, the coffee and alcohol is starting to become a little cloying. I can understand why this is so damn good, but beers like Mikkeller Beer Geek Weasel are just as good. 882 charactersraynmoon, Mar 03, 2014

A - Both vintages, impenetrably black with a meagre mocha head.
S - (2014) aggressive smoke-and-vanilla component to the nose, but the coffee tempers this into something like marshmallow/marzipan. the Zirkana does not manifest as a powerful espresso smell; it’s reminiscent of a house coffee one might get at a good Italian bakery. There’s also caramel and white chocolate but none of the black cherry or currant I get from the regular BCBS. (2013) Fuller and less busy, the nerve-jangler dark roast smell of Los Inmortales has barely faded. I could detect that pleasantly burnt quality, though.
T - 2014  is more astringent than I recall the 2013 vintage being when I drank it fresh. Brighter and sharper than last year’s, with a nutmeg spiciness like the coffee is losing the battle against the bourbon. It’s reminiscent of tiramisu. The coffee in 2013 is better integrated, creating a malted milk body, like the crème in a cherry cordial. Combined with the bourbon and baker’s chocolate, it is glorious.
M - Full, sticky and heavy, but smooth as hell. The coffee cools down the bourbon. 2014 is a bit thinner than 2013, but both are substantial.
I definitely prefer 2013 to 2014, though both are stellar. Cellaring beer is a gamble. It’s experimentation, not investment. One year has, in my opinion, improved 2013 BCBCS. I know the conventional wisdom is don't age coffee beers, but I’m saving another bottle of each vintage to drink in 2016, because even if it’s potentially falling off, who knows? 1,604 charactersTheCuriograph, Mar 01, 2014

Directly below that in small gold letters in a black box is the infamous words "Brand Coffee Stout." At the bottom is where it tells you what kind of coffee it was brewed with. It was brewed with Intelligentsia coffee beans. On the far left edge of the label is the Govt warning and to the far right is a brief description of the beer and a bottled date. There's also a yearly bottled date on the front as well. This bomber bottle is a 2012 vintage. 
When poured into a CCB Teku, this Coffee Stout poured a dark coffee black that was poured into a pitch black mug. Highlights? This beer is far too dark for cheap highlights. Wow! A beer brewed with coffee that was coffee black in color. No surprise there. The head of foam was lackluster, but that's expected from a beer this beer with age on it. Minimal skim of tan foam that quickly disappeared when I laid eyes on it. There was a faint string of rings along the side to say that a head of foam did exist on this beer. A head of foam would have been nice, but my eyes still enjoyed looking at this beer. 
This beer is over a year old and age has yet to settle down the rich aroma of roasted coffee beans in this beer. Following the rich dark aroma of roasted coffee was a quick whiff of dark roasted malt, dark chocolate, and black cherry. After the aroma got those out of the way, in comes the beer's wall of sweetness. This is where my nose stumbled upon an aroma that was just as thick as the coffee presence. This sweetness wall consisted of a nice molasses almost caramel like taste. Rounding off the aroma was bourbon, oak, and a splash of vanilla. My nose enjoyed this beer more than my eyes did. 
The taste was similar to the aroma, but it still wasn't there. Up front was a thick and roasted taste of quality coffee beans. This taste of coffee lingered on for quite a long time before it let through roasted malt, dark chocolate, and black cherry. Directly after the black cherry passed, in comes a big combined taste that featured molasses, oak, bourbon, and a subtle drop of vanilla. While the aroma broke those elements down, the taste just put them into one big taste bomb. As the taste warms up, the vanilla and oak comes out more, but they're still not as big as the initial roasted coffee taste. 
This a thick, chewy, roasted beer that was low in carbonation but certainly not low in flavor or character. I sure hope you like the taste of coffee because you'll find more of it in the aftertaste. Behind the coffee was chocolate, malt, bourbon, and a little oak. 
Even though this is still a kick ass beer that's held up for over a year, I recently had one fresh and thought it was better than this. Would I still drink a vintage bottle? If given the opportunity again, I would! 2,846 charactersAltBock, Feb 20, 2014

4.29/5  rDev -6.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Revisiting Bourbon Coffee, 02/19/14, 12-oz bottle bought at a corner deli in NYC, $7.99
Appearance: The same oily thickness, still appearance, no carbonation and barely any head. A black lagoon through and through. 
Smell: Piercing coffee, fresh strong beans. Gotta love Intelligentsia! Nice woodsy barrel, sharp booze. Peppery! A reviewer talked about jalapenos and red crushed pepper- there is indeed an undeniably spice here. Tequila as well. Some dark fruit, lots of good chocolate. 
Taste: I love it way more than I did in 2012. Perhaps the new coffee beans changed the taste? Bitter and roasty, no traces of that soy sauce/fish sauce I detected in 2012. Burnt sugar, molasses, liquorice.
Mouthfeel: Creamy, smooth, flows like liquid chocolate. Nice tingly spice at the end. Could use a tad more body, but as it is, it works wonders. I like that it is not as overwhelmingly sweet and rich as regular Bourbon County. 
Overall: Drinkability here is outrageous. You could pound this, that's how suave it is. Love the chewy coffee taste at the end of the sip. I won't compare this to Vanilla or Rare like I did in my first review. I won't compare it to regular Bourbon County. This is something else, different, an entity on its own. And a damn delicious entity at that.

Goose Island Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout, bomber bought at a store in Greenwich Village, New York City, for $19.99 plus tax. Bottled 01/11/12, bottle number 1543. 
Appearance: Pours the customary oily, impossibly-rich black. No transparency or shades of light here. Barely a nail worth of head that dies right away and absolutely no lacing. Low carbonation and retention. Not bad, but strange. This is not the majestic looks I expect from the Goose Island Bourbon series. 
Smell: Booze, gasoline, raw petroleum from an oil well in Oklahoma. Salt, soy sauce and braising liquid. Then comes the coffee, good exotic beans brewed cold. Plus a tad of brown sugar and vanilla at the end. 
Taste: Soy sauce morphs into fish sauce when the brew hits the mouth. Same savory-salty base, Mexican chocolate, prickly dry hops at the very end. Or is it the coffee bitterness? The coffee is very subdued, more chocolate than coffee in fact. Milky all around, like drinking chocolate milk from a gas station. Bourbon? Not so much… a tad disappointing, Vanilla or Rare this is NOT!
Mouthfeel: Creamy and rich, full body and flavor, great chocolate finish. Too hot, though. Overtly boozy. 
Overall: I can’t hide my disappointment at this. Would be curious to try it again with a little age on it to mellow the rough spots out, but as it is, fresh (bottled January 11 2012) it is not my thing. I got really drunk and didn’t love the taste/feel. Not exactly drinkable, too alcoholic, the balance is not there. 2,790 charactersDoubleSimcoe, Feb 20, 2014

4.13/5  rDev -9.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4.25Beer #500. An enormous thanks is owed to angrybabboon for sending me a bottle of this from out east of the 2013 vintage for me to review as fresh as possible. (Thanks also to jvbravato for a 22oz of a 2012 vintage!) I did enjoy regular BCBS, and was curious to see how the coffee accentuates the bourbon and massive chocolate-esque malt notes. Poured out of a 12oz bottle into a teku glass. Split with friends.
As with the regular BCBS, this a motor oil pour of the highest proportion - hardly any difference, in this case. Pitch black, super syrupy looking, with modest mocha colored bubbles atop of what struggled to be a head of sorts. Looks a lot like a really decadent liqueur, and indeed, each swirl reveals massive alcohol legs, as well as some light staining against the glass from the beer itself. Not really sure how to rate this is terms of beauty, but it terms of exaggeration, it's definitely made its mark.
The aroma is where this beer separates itself from the pack - this is spicy, peppery, roasted, and far more zesty than the regular BCBS. It's such a radically different flavor profile that I'm amazed that BCBS was the same base beer in the making of this. Huge notes of roasted espresso beans, red crushed pepper, and jalapeños make way at the front, with some notes of cherry, raisins, and plum underneath, albeit in a suffocating manner due to the intense spiciness imparted by the coffee. The sweet oaky notes from the bourbon are there, but are also buried beneath - toffee, vanilla, some coconut, and brown sugar. This is a very different beast, and it's definitely really unique. It's not my favorite but it's too fascinating to disregard.
The flavor's pretty much the same story - although, thankfully, the peppery notes are little bit more controlled on the palate and the roasted coffee character shines through in a more appropriate manner. Very zesty and nutty from the espresso, with roasted qualities that cancel out any potential sweetness overkill from the thick dark malt profile, which imparts notes of fudge and chocolate, as well as raisins, ripe cherries, and molasses. The barrel character notes are also mildly sweet here, and while there's the classic vanilla/coconut/cinnamon profile that BCBS is known for, it's instead more subdued for the sweet qualities and reveals more rustic and earthier aspects of the barrels - tobacco and leather, to mention a bit. Nevertheless, it's a spicy, earthy, liqueur-like concoction, and I'm glad it tastes different. I only wish it were a little less syrupy and thick (to the point of distraction), as the overall loss of carbonation throughout consumption really affects the enjoyable factor of fully committing to this in the long run.
A great beer, no doubt, but not what I expected at all. It's very flavorful and provides a bitter and spicy punch to a beer that's typically far sweeter in nature. Nevertheless, while it contains a little less heat and barrel sweetness overall, I daresay that's the main reason that I enjoy BCBS to begin with. Still, any self-respecting beer geek would be crazy to not seek this out - it's by far one of the most memorable coffee infused stouts I've ever had. This vintage would not benefit with age, in my view. It will get progressively earthy and lose its coffee profile. Without any of the spiciness, it won't be as thrilling. I'm absolutely curious how the 2012 vintage is drinking right now - will post an update as soon as I get around to trying it! 3,482 charactersmagictacosinus, Feb 10, 2014

The aroma: the strongest, and most realistic coffee I have experienced in a coffee beer. Not a hint of coffee- it's the real deal. A true coffee roast is in the aroma.
Mouth feel: moderate. This suits the beer, and transitions well into the taste.
Taste: the taste evolves with warming. Strong coffee, chocolate, and cherry. These flavors are in the coffee notes. Check out the review of the coffee http://www.coffeereview.com/review.cfm?ID=789 This is a high mountain grown coffee from El Salvador.
Finish: light Bourbon. The Backyard Rye and the Bourbon County stout have stronger Bourbon finishes. The Bourbon finish is lighter on this beer.
Overall- another great beer in the series. However, if the temp is too warm, the tastes dissipate.Best at 50-55F. Possibly start at 48F. A snifter works well for this beer. 915 charactersbrureview, Feb 06, 2014

4.68/5  rDev +2.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75I got a bottle of Goose Island's Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout that my friend brought over to share with me. Having just tried BCBS I'm really looking forward to have a chance to try the coffee version, so lets see how it goes. 2013 Vintage. Poured from a brown 12oz bottle into a snifter. 
A- The label is pretty very similar to BCBS, but I think the bright red background makes it stick out more and I wish they would put the name of the coffee company and specific type of coffee they used on the label. It poured a nice dark black color similar to motor oil and it didn't let any light come through with a half a fingers worth of lighter brown head that quickly died to a very thin ring that eventually faded away and it didn't really leave any lacing behind. This was a really good looking strong stout, it looked pretty similar to BCBS.
S- The aroma starts off with a higher amount of medium sweetness that had a molasses like aroma to it followed by the roasted malts being the first to show up and they impart a great roasted aroma with a good amount of chocolate coming through and it's immediately followed by a very strong coffee aroma that reminds me of the way that a expensive cup of coffee smells. Up next comes the barrel which imparts some great vanilla, oak, lightly boozy and bourbon aromas with a slight caramel aroma in the background. This beer had a very good aroma, the coffee might be just a little overpowering, but all the good BCBS aspects still stand out.
T- The taste seems to be pretty similar to the aroma and it starts off with a higher amount of medium sweetness that had a molasses like flavor to it and it's followed by the roasted malts still being the first to show up and they impart all those nice roasted aspects that I got in the aroma with chocolate showing up nicely and it has that fudge like flavor that I got In BCBS. Up next comes the coffee that shows up pretty strongly and it imparts that nice cup of coffee aspect and it's followed by the barrel which imparts some nice oak, vanilla and bourbon flavors with a light caramel sweetness in the background. On the finish there's a noticeable amount of alcohol that seems to be on the lighter side and it's slightly warming, with a slightly lower medium amount of coffee like bitterness with a coffee and bourbon like aftertaste. This was a very good tasting beer, the coffee worked well with this beer, but it covered up a little bit of those chocolate and barrel aspects that I really like.
M- Fairly smooth, lightly boozy, rich, a slightly sticky, full bodied with a lower amount of carbonation. This beer had a great mouthfeel that worked very well with it.
Overall I thought this was a very good beer and a very good example of a strong barrel aged Stout, the coffee had a really nice flavor to it and it for sure lived up to the name of Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout and I feel that the Coffee was showcased in the beer, it helped the beer in some ways, but it also hurt it in other ways. This beer had nice drinkability, it's a sipper, but not as much BCBS, it's fairly smooth, rich, a little sticky, a little filling, lightly boozy and the taste did a great job at holding my attention, I might contemplate drinking two of these, but just like BCBS one might be the perfect amount for me, and it males for a great beer to a sip on a cold winter morning. What I like the most about this beer was the mouthfeel, I think the coffee caused it to not be as sticky as BCBS and I really liked that. What I liked the least about this beer was that the coffee was just a little too dominating in the taste, if it was dialed back a notch or two I think it would allow some more of those chocolate and bourbon flavors to come through while enhancing the pretty light coffee flavors that BCBS has, I would for sure buy this beer if I ever saw it, I haven't seen BCBS around here so I doubt I will see the variants, my friend had to get this one shipped to him from North Dakota. I would recommend this to anyone who likes Coffee Stouts, especially if your a big fan of KBS. All in all I was pretty happy with this beer, i do think it could be balanced just a little better,but other than that I think it's pretty close to being world class and I might even like it a little more than KBS, I would have to have the two side by side to figure it out. BCBS is still my favorite of the series so far, but this one came fairly close. Great job guys, this was another great beer and I'll be on the look out for the other variants, keep up the kick ass work. 4,557 charactersStoutHunter, Feb 03, 2014

The aroma is stellar, the taste is what you would expect and more from a world class coffee stout; full, rich, coffee/cocoa flavors mixed with vanilla and leaving the taster wanting more.

S: Bourbon, chocolate, cherries, and oak aromas sting the nostrils in a good way. The smell entices you to want to drink it, but don't. For first time drinkers of this beer, stop and wait at this stage to enjoy. (Coming from a man who only has 1 12 oz bottle)
T: Bourbon, chocolate, cherries, and coffee sends a smooth flavor rolling down the tongue. Stopping and high five-ing every taste bud on its way down the throat. Best stout I've ever had until this point.
M: Probably the best quality of this beer is the mouthfeel. Warm and cozy, this beer spreads out, commands the gums to fetch its slippers, pulls back the arm on the recliner and makes itself at home. I don't want this feeling to end.
O: Is it the rarity of this beer that makes me want to have it on the specialist of occasions? If I had 2 cases of this sitting in front of me right now, would I feel the same? Not sure. May never know. All I know is I don't want this beer to end. 1,071 charactersBSK_ONE, Feb 01, 2014

Everytime it comes to my neck of the woods in Long Island it is gone before I know it. I've had the Barleywine, and the Brand Stout before. I was blown away by the Barleywine, but found the Stout to be a little to strong on the alcohol presence (it is 15% after all!). With that being said, I love all types of stouts. Drinking two immediately and aging the other two until next year, or until I can't keep myself from opening one.
Beer was drank at room temperature and poured into a snifter.
As soon as I opened the bottle, the aromas just exploded. Coffee, bourbon and a hint of chocolate. Alcohol is easily detectable in the nose.
The pour reveals an extremely jet black, syrup-like beer that has virtually no head what-so-ever besides the slight carbonation lacing around the edges of the glass. Completely black, exactly what I expect it. 
First sip. Absolutely delicious. Coffee, vanilla, bourbon and an exotic chocolate fudge taste at the end. BIG, bold flavors. The flavors linger on your palate for an extremely long time until you decide that you need another sip. Coffee taste is brilliant and balances well to keep the bourbon from overpowering the beer. Excellent.
Very heavy beer, and the alcohol is clearly present. Just a reminder to pace myself with this one. However, I'm finding it hard to just "sip".
Overall, a flawless example of an Imperial Coffee Stout. For $5 a bottle, it's absolutely worth it. I don't say that often. If you come across it, don't worry about the price, it's a must have for beer lovers. 1,644 charactersBoardwalkBock, Jan 30, 2014

A: Pours black with faint reddish highlights in the edges of the glass. Half-inch thick dark mocha head which fades to the rim leaving spots of lace.
N: Immensely sweet creamed roasted coffee, bourbon bon bons, oaky wood, vanilla, marshmallow, dark chocolate, dark fruits, floral, molasses. Wow.
T: Complex and well balanced. Sweet roasted coffee, bourbon, vanilla, caramel, dark chocolate, boozy.
M: Full body and semi-moderate carbonation. Smooth, rich, creamy, thick, oily, syrupy. Finishes with a slightly astringent bitter boozy coffee. Nearly perfect.
O: Huge fan. Well done. Want more. #500. 656 characterswethorseblanket, Jan 29, 2014

Poured from the bottle.
The beer poured jet-black in colour.
The smell was of sweet molasses and faint bourbon.
The beer had a very strong taste. It had coffee, chocolate, and finished with bourbon. 
It was a very heavy, syrup-like sipping beer.
Wold I buy it again? Probably. 295 charactersNilocRellim, Jan 28, 2014

Pour: Poured into a snifter. Appearance is almost black with minimal head.
Aroma: Deep and complex. There is tons of coffee, decadent chocolate with bittersweet undertones and a hint of toffee on the end.
Taste: Wow. Not since the first time I had CCB's Hunahpu's Stout have I had something this delicious. There's heavy coffee, toffee, bittersweet chocolate and a big alcohol finish to remind you to take it easy.
Mouthfeel: Quite enjoyable. Creamy and warm with just the right amount of carbonation.
Overall: I was blown away by this stout. It is extremely balanced and loud at the same time. I also really dig that it is available in a 12oz bottle. Goose Island really knocked this one out of the park. Don't hesitate to pick this one up if you see it. 773 charactersSeatsTaken, Jan 27, 2014

Thick, dark brown, nearly black pour with the shortest lived head I've ever seen and zero lacing. The nose is earthy roasted coffee initially, but quickly opens up with lots of bourbon and cocoa along with hints of vanilla, oak, and milk chocolate. The taste is nothing short of amazing! Complex and dominated by wonderful fresh roasted coffee, chocolate fudge, vanilla, bourbon,tobacco, molasses, espresso, and some subtle dark fruits (black cherry). The mouthfeel is thick and rich and smooth as silk! This is definitely a sipper, but a very drinkable sipper with a nice warming finish.
Picked up the 2013 version from a great trade with Mike! Besides the obvious difference in the size of the bottle, I wouldn't change a thing on my previous review. This is hands down the best coffee stout out there! 850 charactersbeerdrifter, Jan 24, 2014

A - Poured into my Duvel tulip a deep, deep nearly pitch black hue with a thin quarter inch dark chocolate head that fades to leave a thin halo
S - Aromas of soft bourbon, nice rich coffee, fainter chocolate. Tons of coffee here with some sweeter malts as well. Bit too sweet.
T - Taste is like I remember, similar to the nose but on the sweet side. The coffee here is nice and black and strong. Good bourbon notes and some stronger alcohol finish. Everything is pretty harmonious.
M - Mouthfeel is nice, thick and almost chewy with a fair amount of alcohol.
O - Overall, while this is a good BA coffee stout..it really, really isn't worth the hype. There are so many other, better coffee stouts out there that bring much much more to the table in flavour and aroma. 882 charactersrudzud, Jan 23, 2014

I didn't know what to expect from this beer and after quietly and slowly enjoying this, I have to say that this is the richest beer and maybe the richest liquid that I've ever ingested. 
Period. 
The booze was so well hidden and the flavors meshed so well together that this almost didn't feel like beer, If it were possible to take rich coffee, chocolate, vanilla extract, bourbon, and port and brew them together, something like this would emerge. Thankfully, I don't have to do that as i can just savor this for all that it's worth! 
Great pour to this, as the dark, silky liquid made it's way out of the glass about as smoothly as possible. A nice tan head left it's mark even though it wasn't terribly large or long-lasting. Lots of coffee, vanilla, and deep chocolate in the nose. No powder or milk here - this was the real deal and boy was it intoxicating. Once I took a good taste of this, everything just became that much more magnified. Even cheese could be felt here - something creamy like Brie came to mind as the mouthfeel of this left a smooth coating on my mouth and palate after each sip and well after I polished this off. The bourbon and cherry/port flavors added a lot of depth to this, on top of the exotic chocolate and coffee notes that I expected here, but even those were above those that I usually would find in a beer available during the Winter months. 
To be fair, this was strong. Really really strong and not something to be messed with. This wasn't cheap but the price was well worth it as the strength of the bourbon-like booze and the underlying woodiness of it reminded me that this was no ordinary beer. It's pretty rare to find something so varied as this that also felt so harmonious at the same time and even more rare to find a beer that reminded me at the time I drank it of how impressive a "liquid bread" can be. The truly great beers make you feel at the time of their consumption that you're damn lucky to be alive in a place and time where sheer happiness is obtainable and thankfully, this was one of those beers that reminded me of why I love beer so much. If you can find it, ignore the price posted and just get this. All 5 of your senses will thank you indefinitely. 2,309 charactersJerzDevl2000, Jan 20, 2014

Robust aromas of the sweet bourbon notes, rich roasted coffee, as well as hints of wood and cocoa.
The flavor is similar with the constant play between the generous amounts of roasted coffee and malt, sweet cocoa, woody bourbon notes and a slight boozy bite at the finish.
This is quite a hearty beer with limited carbonation and a thick, boozy, palate coating finish.
What a great beer. It really is as one would expect. . .the Bourbon County with the perfect component of coffee. 660 charactersCHADMC3, Jan 20, 2014

It poured a deep dark color as I always hope for in a stout. The nose was coffee all the way, but with some good amount of chocolate in there.
I could have put my nose into the glass all night long, since it was so appealing.
The taste was big, very big. The coffee was upfront, and there was a definite amount of carbonation, The taste had a semi-burn feel from the alcohol, but that was not over powering.
The finish was exceptionally balance. In fact, I think I enjoyed the finish on this beer more than actual tasting it from the start 627 charactersrdilauro, Jan 19, 2014

This is dark as midnight with no moon or stars. Right after the pour there is a little, frothy, caramel colored head that slightly rings the glass. This quickly dissipates. 
Smell:
Big bold coffee notes engulf your face and linger there. Cocoa nibs are so enticing its almost as if you had your face in front of a 7 layer decadent cake. 
Taste:
Strong Ethiopian coffee flavors. Sweet cocoa and ripe cherry. 
Mouthfeel:
Pleasantly thick, coating my mouth with roasty chocolate and caramel flavors that linger well after.
Overall:
This is exactly what an Imperial coffee stout should be like. A flawless prime example of the style with the complex bold coffee delicately hiding the high abv. As a major coffee lover, this by far is one of my personal favorites. 792 charactersjackiechan2700, Jan 19, 2014

Got to try this beer at the ACBF 2010 and all I could say is holy crap! This beer is wonderful, it was just overly flavorful. The color was black with a pretty good head for something so strong. The beer was thick and complex as hell. The bourbon screams out in this brew, there are flavors of coffee, vanilla, and lots of booze. This beer reminded me a little bit of Sam Adams Triple Bock but much better. This beer deserves another try, if I ever see it again I'll surely pick up some. 671 charactersKnapp85, Jan 18, 2014

A - black, dense, opaque, no light coming through on this one. Not sure how people give a score to appearance (what constitutes a 5 and what gets a 4) but as someone who loves stouts, this is a very inviting sign for me.
S - Warm, boozy bourbon top note - this smells a lot like the regular BCS. Less aroma of coffee then I expected. Subtle scent of vanilla, chocolate, caramel, and roasted malts
T - Fantastic. Very much like the aromatic experience but with the inclusion of soft coffee. All the flavors have melded together wonderfully - roasted malts, coffee, vanilla, dark fruits all blend well with the bourbon. Coffee is more subtle than I expected, not overpowering like some coffee stouts. Smoother than the regular BCS (which I find a tad hot when fresh)
M - Thick, sticky yet smooth. 
D - Possibly my favorite beer of 2013, if not ever. I wish every coffee stout was this well balanced and that every bourbon barrel aged beer was this well done. We'll have to see if CCB can't out do this with their Barrel Aged Cafe Americana

Pours about as black as it can get. Looks like most of the BC variants. The beer sticks to the glass like its life depends on it. Very small head, low visible carbonation. As dark as the abyss, no light can penetrate this stuff.
Smells incredible. Sweet, creamy chocolate and sweet coffee. Tons of bourbon too, of course.
Tastes even better. Most coffee stouts I've had impart a bitter coffee flavor- this one imparts a really sweet coffee flavor. I'm not sure if its the already sweet Bourbon County base making the coffee taste sweet, or the actual coffee beans used, but I'm liking it. The bourbon is strong, as expected- bringing intense bourbon sweetness, oak, and lots of vanilla. Might be tasting some tobacco in there too. Not very bitter at all.
The mouthfeel is incredible, as expected. So sticky, so viscous, just a big glop of awesome in the glass.
Incredible. Only one word for it really. 1,014 charactersGreesyFizeek, Jan 16, 2014

just wrote up a detailed review and got timed out, so here are my mother fucking conclusions about this brew:
big and boozy, this brew has enough to wreak your pallet in a good way. the coffee keeps things interesting enough and certainly refreshing enough to keep you coming back. one of the best coffee stouts ive had ever. HOWEVER, I wish more bourbon came across on the palate, but perhaps some of that is disguised by the booze in the original stout. +13% ABV does leave a few things behind. 
regardless, worth seeking out. wouldn't trade my first born for it, but radical none the less. 609 charactersJimmys, Jan 16, 2014

A- pours pitch black, like motor oil with a small fizzy dark tan head that retains for a few seconds, then reduces to a ring around the glass that leaves lots of alcohol legs and short-lasting lace when agitated 
S- amazing, strong and in you face notes of bourbon, chocolate, fresh espresso, vanilla, toffee, raisin bread, fig and nutty oak. I can literally smell this beer from over a foot away 
T- big bourbon notes mesh with a malty toffee/caramel sweetness that sets the stage for the fresh coffee/espresso flavors to kick in mid-palate with flavors of dark chocolate mixed in. Nearing the finish, I pick up some dark fruits flavors; tart dark cherry, fig and prune. The finish lingers with barrel juice, vanilla, oak, soy sauce and sweet chocolaty malt 
M- thick and viscous body with medium carbonation gives way to a foamy and chewy mouthfeel, leading to a smooth bubbly finish, that lingers big warming alcohol notes, warming the entire body 
O- this beer deserves every bit of the hype that it receives, it's in your face and leaves a taste in your mouth long after consuming. My bottle was about 14 months old, and I wonder if the coffee would be more prevalent in a fresh bottle. A little more coffee presence would have bumped the taste up to a 5, so I'll have to find a fresh one for comparison. Well done GI 1,372 charactersTreyliff, Jan 15, 2014

Intro: 12 oz. bottle served in a tulip glass
Appearance: Dark black, opaque. Ample head with good retention. It looked creamy when poured into the glass. It caused anticipation to build for the first smell/taste. It’s one of those beers where you can just tell it’s going to be good just from the appearance. 
Smell: Rich malts, chocolate, dark fruits, bourbon, and alcohol with maybe a hint of vanilla. And of course coffee, rich roasted coffee. At 13+% ABV you can’t hide the alcohol but there is a host of fragrances that come through. The anticipation builds. It is a VERY inviting brew. 
Taste: BINGO!!! Game over! The Holy Grail has been found! WOW!! This did not disappoint, in fact it exceeded all I’ve heard about it. You taste alcohol but not overpowering. There is sweetness but not cloying so. A perfect balance IMHO. Let me say first off, I’m not a big coffee fan, I lean towards chocolate but this taste was just amazing. I killed the first one way to quickly and an hour later I had to have another. 
Mouthfeel: Creamy coating that lasts throughout. Just adds to the pleasure.
Overall: As I said, GAME OVER!! It has been found. It’s #1 in its class so far. I haven’t given a perfect 5.0 rating to anything because I figure I haven’t found it yet and don’t know what’s around the corner, but this is as close to perfection that I have found so far. Do yourself a favor; if you like stouts… seek this beer out. You won’t be disappointed. 1,526 charactersheysuz, Jan 14, 2014

Poured into a crystal snifter oily black with minimal khaki head.
The nose is full of bourbon, vanilla, dark roasted malts, cacao nibs, and raw coffee beans. Reminds me of Zombie Dust in the fact that I could literally just smell this beer and be happy. 
Tastes really smooth tons of bourbon and tinges of dark coffee notes with some mild bitterness reminding you this is actually beer. Little bit of harshness comes through with the alcohol content but it is kept in check well with all the great oaky and malt sweetness. 
In conclusion I love this beer I am going to definitely age the rest I think a year or two would do this beer wonders especially with the slight alcohol burn but I think this is definitely a benchmark barrel aged beer and I look forward to enjoying this in a year or two. Cheers! 965 charactersac22rush, Jan 13, 2014

4.68/5  rDev +2.2%look: 4.25 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75I was told this beer wasn't going to make it to Connecticut, so I was surprised when I saw it on the shelf. I'd been seeking this out for about a month with no luck. 
I'm very happy to report that it lives up to the hype. Too many beers on the top 250 don't (I'm thinking about you, Heady Topper)
The smell of this beer is off the charts. Tons of coffee, vanilla, and roasty malts, all perfectly balanced and intense. This is not a beer for beginners. 
Luckily, the taste mirrors the aroma very well. A near perfect balance of vanilla and coffee with some chocolate malt and Guinness like creaminess on the end. The flavors dance in your mouth in perfect unison. There's just enough bitterness to compliment the creamy mouthfeel, and the flavors change in your mouth quite profoundly. 
On Goose Island's website, they tell me the coffee used is Intelligentsia Los Inmortales from El Salvador; a coffee described as "dense" and "complex." It's also from the unique and under-utilized "Bourbon" coffee variety. Bourbon County stout using bourbon coffee and aged in bourbon barrels. Hell yes! 
The Bourbon County line of beers has grown into something truly wonderful. This year's stout and barley wine are also excellent. I can't wait to see what all three do in my cellar for a few years. Three years from now (when Elizabeth Warren is hopefully President), I'm going to taste all three from 2013 and report back. This 2013 class is setting the standard for barrel aged stouts. The gauntlet has been thrown. 1,511 charactersabriggs1, Jan 11, 2014

A- An aggressive pour resulted in a very small, mocha-colored head. Faded quickly to a thin ring around the edge of the glass. A lovely shade of darkness with only a small amount of light peeking through around the edges.
S- Kill me now and I'll die happy. Bourbon soaked espresso beans drizzled with melted chocolate. That is all. So much balance, it really is remarkable.
T- Initially put this as a 4.75, but as I sipped it became quite evident that it's a solid 5. I don't know what else one could do to improve the flavor. All the bourbon, coffee and chocolate play together beautifully. It's like a perfectly choreographed flamenco dance on my tongue. One flavor makes an appearance only to allow the others to make their oresence known. None are so selfish as to hog the limelight. I'm in love.
M- Very nice mouthfeel. Could us a little more viscosity. Was expecting something a little thicker from a 13.4% beer. This beer just lingers, and it is so, so welcome. Warming from the alchohol and bourbon chases the beer down the throat and just sits. And sits. And sits.
Allowed my mom, dad and sister each a sip or two. They all have an appreciation for beer, but are nowhere near the enthusiast I am. Said my dad, "That might be the best beer I've ever tasted." My sister: "Mmmm... I LIKE THAT." My mother: "Wow. That is good." There you have it, folks. This is why Bourbon County is the king of barrel-aged beers. 1,529 charactersjbwimer, Jan 10, 2014

4.69/5  rDev +2.4%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.752012 Vintage! Bottled on 1/11/12. Finally opened for my 28th birthday on this 9th of January, 2014.
This is a heavy hitter. Wow.
A: Black as a beer can be. Not even light gets through. No head to speak of, whatsoever. Fizzy, light brown bubbles briefly form with an aggressive pour but nothing hangs around. Just dark, ominous liquid. No lace with a tiny, light brown ring of foam as well as the expected legs. Legs for dayz! While I prefer a good-looking head, this beer appears as it should. It's actually intimidating.
S: A good whiff of the nose gave me a buzz. Huge malt, booze, dark fruit, molasses, espresso, wood, and...hot booze.
T: Flavor is much bigger on the espresso/dark roast coffee. Pretty serious booze presence. But mostly in a good way. So much flavor and so complex that it's difficult to describe, especially as it warms (and the buzz gets stronger). Almost like a port, to be honest. Booze, roasted malt, dark chocolate, and some spent espresso grind is what stands out.
M: Super smooth with the expected feel from massive amounts of coffee. For what it is, this aspect of the beer is top notch.
O: Quite a treat. But it's so massive that it's almost exhausting to drink. Should have split it with someone. A bomber to myself was a lot of work. What else needs to be said? Really happy I was able to drink this. 1,339 charactersGatch, Jan 10, 2014

T- amazing coffee, plenty of the flavors from the barrel, dark fruit such as plums, dark cocoa, vanilla flavors from the bourbon, alcohol is well hidden. Subtle sweetness.
M- very smooth for such a high abv, barely any carbonation.
O- I've been seeking this out for a while, and it definitely lives up to the hype. The flavors play off each other so well. Usually a BA stout is a bourbon bomb, this one uses the bourbon flavors as a compliment and not the focus. The coffee flavors are not bitter, but smooth. Again the coffee flavor is a compliment and in no way over powers the beer. Add in the sweet vanilla, caramel, dark fruit, and other great compliments and you get a truly world class stout. 868 charactersbrewtus, Jan 09, 2014

A small ring of froth quickly sinks into the beer. Doesn't look overly pretty but the density looks appealing. Smells great.Bourbon, Chocolate, Toffee and marzipan form a buttery thick aroma, while spent coffee grounds knife through. There is some vanilla and some peppermint, but i think that might be the alcohol sting. On the tongue, the alcohol comes through a little hot but a wave of sweet with malt, toffee, and a hint of cocoa quickly coats the tongue. The coffee is a little subdued but a nice foil for the sweet. Finishes warm like liquor. Nice and Thick with a surprising little late wave of carbonation that keeps this beer from being too cloying. Excellent structure.
Very nice overall. Unlike most beers so its hard to compare it to others, but a very tasty drink. 861 charactersjmaharaj, Jan 08, 2014

Smells coffee, cocoa, vanilla, clean alcohol sting, almond, bourbon, black-strap molasses, and very lightly of mint. Thick, robust, hearty aroma. Well balanced and inviting. Only knock is that there is a drying acidity, like from coffee that has been left on the burner too long.
Tastes wonderful. Intense flavors with a clean alcohol. Not as sticky sweet as regular BBCS. Flavors are coffee, wet chocolate, vanilla, bourbon, hazelnut & almond, caramel-coated raspberries, sweetened scorch, blackberry, and chocolate malt. Great diversity of flavors that are balanced and complimentary.
Moderate carbonation, thick in the mouth (but lifted off the tongue by carbonation and clean alcohol sting), and has a lingering warming. An acidity associated with the coffee is a bit to astringent for my preferences. 860 charactersmentor, Jan 08, 2014

Appearance: Pours very deep brown, with just the edges having a hint of translucent amber - the rest is opaque. Very little head, not enough to see.
Smell: Roasty coffee, roasted malts, bourbon, dark chocolate, dark fruits, oak. Pretty complex aroma lead by the coffee notes.
Taste: Coffee, bourbon, oak, fudge, plums, figs, roasted malts. Really well balanced flavor, and lots of it. Really pleasant - just the right amount of sweetness.
Mouth-feel: Low to medium carbonation with a full, creamy body. Lovely mouth-feel. Finishes smooth.
Overall: This is a wonderful coffee stout - the best coffee-forward stout (or beer, in fact) that I've had. Well balanced but the coffee leads the way. A delightful, big, flavorful (yet drinkable - I can't get enough!) beer from GI. They manage to blend the flavors so flawlessly. 934 charactersResuin, Jan 04, 2014

This meets all expectations and may be one of the best beers I have ever had. Incredibly smooth. Not much heat from the bourbon barrels, and a solid mix from the coffee. I am sure this would be good with age, but it is great now. Age it too long and I think it would lose a lot of the coffee flavor that makes this a great beer. 462 charactersSStein, Jan 02, 2014

Appearance - Aggressive pour yields a half-finger head of chocolate brown that fizzes a little before dissipating fairly quickly. It leaves a smattering of film along the surface of an inky black-brown body of syrupy looking liquid. It *looks* rich, if a beverage can look such a way. It makes me think I should be pouring it over ice cream. No lacing whatsoever.
Smell - Decadent and rich, with roasty notes of coffee and dark chocolate, oak and wood, as well as some fainter notes of bourbon and light vanilla. The barrel characteristics become a bit more observable as it warms a bit, with some of the roasted malt shining through as well. But make no mistake, wonderfully fragrant french roast is the predominant flavor.
Taste - So many wonderful flavors at play here--fresh pressed espresso, roasted coffee beans, fudge, dark chocolate syrup, bourbon, burnt caramel and molasses. The initial urge I had to pour this over ice cream from the appearance is reinforced by the taste. There is a little bit of spiciness to the finish--it comes in the upper chest, along with the slight alcohol burn, but it's clear that there is more to it. Almost like some black pepper or other spice.
Mouthfeel - Full-bodied with minimal carbonation. Just enough to cut through the viscous, syrupy feel to the beer. Rich and mouth-coating. And there is a noticeable warming in the upper chest after swallowing, much like drinking an Irish coffee.
Overall, just an amazingly decadent and worthwhile beer. It's one of the best coffee beers I've had, and if you further narrow down to best barrel-aged coffee beer, it's probably THE best. It's amazingly smooth and rich, but still has some bite from the coffee and ABV. This is one I'd have over and over again i it were easier to procure. 1,992 charactersLambicPentameter, Jan 02, 2014

A: Jet black, thin tan-colored head that fades rather quickly.
S: Hints of molasses, vanilla, bourbon, and coffee, although coffee doesn't overpower whatsoever. 
T: This is one delicious stout! Notes of caramel, toffee, and vanilla give this beer it's sweetness. Coffee really starts to shine through as the beer warms. Bourbon on the backend, but not nearly as hot as one would think with the 13.4% ABV.
M: Slick, full-bodied with a low carbonation that creates a near-perfect mouthfeel.

Appearance - Pours very thick almost like oil. A nice 1 finger khaki head stays for a bit but doesn't last long. Almost an oily sheen that sits on top of the beer - I'm guessing this is from the coffee. No visible lacing
Smell - Vanilla, caramel, bourbon and as it warmed the coffee became more apparent.
Taste - Like the smell and as it warmed the flavors became more balanced. 
Mouth feel - Thick and creamy with some heat on the end. I was expecting more of a boozy finish but was happy that it was pretty smooth given the ABV.
Overall - Lives up to the hype for sure but was expecting more coffee. 619 charactersshadetree67, Jan 01, 2014

4.42/5  rDev -3.5%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 12 oz brown bottle into a clear glass snifter. Bottled on 15NOV13 on back label. Purchased at Wine Warehouse (Charlottesville, VA). 
A: Pitch black with the scrapings of a tan head that dissipates quickly and leaves no lacing. Imposing but not an especially impressive appearance.
S: Huge dark fruit character up front is soon squashed by big bourbon character and some alcoholic aromas. There is a gentle sweetness from some coconut coupled with the intense caramel malts they must dose this brew with. The coffee aroma is behind most of the other aromas and its presence is mainly a roasty, bitter edge to the aroma although it is more discernible with warming. Not a whole lot different than fresh BCBS.
T: Flavors of prune, fig, and candied dates are quite intense and hit first with a big wallop of caramel and toffee thrown in as well -- very enjoyable sweet blast. This gives way to coconut, vanilla, and bourbon aged character. A creamy, milk chocolate quality breaks through the middle to end of the flavor as well. The coffee component is most apparent in the aftertaste which is decidedly strong with bitter espresso. Sweet overall but pretty well-balanced for such a huge beer. Alcohol is pretty hot but not overwhelming. A sweetish dessert beer with a good shot of espresso in the back end to help bring it full circle.
M: Full-bodied with low carbonation and a stellar creamy mouthfeel. I docked it only for the hot alcohol which is hard to avoid I know but does detract from the drinking experience a little.
O: A really stellar beer with a slight edge over BCBS but not that big of a difference in my mind. Big dark malt fruit, barrel, and chocolate flavors that come to a espresso-ish finale. It's one of those beers that I would love once or twice a year, but I think I prefer BCBS for more frequent consumption as it seems less sweet overall. Still, BCBS Coffee is an exceptional beer. 1,923 charactersargock, Dec 31, 2013

12/12/13 – Served in a GI taster glass
A: Pours much like the base beer with that dark inky black body and subtle brown edge. Glossy reflective sheen. Virtually no head presents minus a quick fizz of mocha bubbles. Sits perfectly still otherwise with a just few dots and some legs of alcohol running down the glass. 
S: Smells of darkened black malts with a sweet chocolaty note with expressive espresso bean. There is a slight woodsy earthiness to the nose and a touch of vanilla. Some alcohol vapor coming through. Super coffee aroma on this one which is really great. 
T: Tastes sweet with dark chocolate covered espresso beans and a good dose of alcohol heat. Has a deep and rich coffee character that marries quite well with the dark malts. In turn, I find this missing some of the Bourbon spirit that is so pronounced in the base beer. Touch of scorched vanilla and some earthy minerals there with a hint of dark berries. Low amount of tingly bitterness that cuts through the sweetness just enough and some more noticeable alcohol flavor. Pretty solid and really potent with the coffee.
M: Fairly dense with a semi thick body. Light abv warmth on the palate. Slick and oily feel with a low amount of carbonation. Light drying effort.
D: Big thanks to Dan for cracking this. I love coffee and this variant has a ton of it but you do lose some of the barrel character as a result. Would definitely love to spend more time with this one but I think I actually prefer the base beer. 1,533 charactersNugganooch, Dec 30, 2013

Appearance: Pitch black like the night with a subtle brown tint to it. The tan head is easy with maybe a notch under a finger's length.
Smell: This might be laeled as a coffee brand stout but in all honesty it is more potent in molasses and sugar with a note of coffee. 
Taste: Wow what a hit of flavor, you feel everything from sweet brown sugars and light espresso at the end. This is absolutely a quality brew, and ridiculously addicting taste. When I bought this bottle I should have grabbed the freaking shelf. 
Mouth: Real f'n sticky, with medium mouth carbonation. After taste is incredible sweet with a bitter coffee finish. 
Overall: Some beers are hyped up and others just have good presentation, this brew really f'n delivers. Barely room for improvement. Have another glass on me. Salud. 859 charactersBlurryVisi0n, Dec 30, 2013

S: may just be the loveliest coffee aroma I've smelted - in beer or even just in coffee.... I've gotta visit this Intelligentsia spot... wow! fantastic shit.... bold, vibrant, tasty depth.... not too roasty, not too (malty-)sweet (these are smells, trust me).... just fantastically blended and balanced
T: with the big coffee element, I can't help feeling it needs a bolder, mildly caramel-dipped malt presence - actually, it's there - but the bitterness and elegant roast drag it down... all in all, the malt foundation is fantasmic - I just crave a little more depth from it.... aftertaste is just super delicate dark roast coffee, thinned out by the phantom booze, with just a hint of super-subtle/rich candy-bar-esque malt and estery 'sweet'ness
M: not much else they can do here.... wow!... creamy-smooth but attenuated as if with coffee (coffee, 2 creamers, and a tsp o' sugga?)
O: I may be selling this short.... how did they fit 13+% into this?! good god! - a creeper for sure... i can't believe how (feverishly) drinkable this is?

A: Vigorous pour raised very minimal barrel colored head. Disappears almost immediately. Black as night, like staring into the abyss. Beautiful.
S: Snifter full of aroma, smells of coffee beans, oak, smoke, bourbon and vanilla. 
T: This is what sets this beer apart. The coffee really comes through, but not so much that you lose the balance. Warming bourbon sensation, with a palate of vanilla sweetness. As it warms, chocolate and smoke start to come out. Absolutely perfect.
M: Viscous body, heavy but not artificially so. Carb is perfect here and really allows the flavors to stay on the tongue a bit longer than usual. 
O: 3rd or 4th time with this beer and still surprises in its shiftiness. I love BA stouts and have had most of the big boys, but this and the Backyard Rye remain my favorites. Being a coffee lover makes this a bit more appealing, but overall a perfectly balanced BA stout. Bravo! 938 charactersTheSleepyMonkey, Dec 26, 2013

Bottle
Appearance - Opaque black with a slight cola color around the edges when held up to a light.  Very still, with little to no head. 
Aroma - Espresso/coffee beans, bourbon soaked chocolate, hint of raisins. 
Taste - Similar to nose with the additions of vanilla, toffee, and oak. Perfect. 
Mouthfeel - Medium to full bodied, bourbon oak. A hint of heat shines through at the end. Excellent! The 13+% is masked nicely in this monstrous ale. 
Overall - I will continue to search for this beer as the hype is real. It's as close to perfect as I imagined. If there was a touch more carbonation, it would receive all 5's. Do not care about ABInBev with this product. 695 charactersKVNBGRY, Dec 25, 2013

Poured from bottle into pint glass, with minimal head notwithstanding intentional efforts to render big foam with an aggressive pour (perhaps I served it too cold). Lots of tiny mocha bubbles in deep, dark background. The view is like looking into an inviting black hole, enticing the viewer to leap into the abyss. The smell is off the charts, like the love you lost in college. And that first taste reminds me of my first hint of eroticism...mystical and captivating, yielding pangs of guilty pleasure (somehow, I know what I am about to do must be illegal). The coffee flavors are almost too intense and overpowering, but not quite. Toffee, vanilla, espresso, and caramel all appear here. And the finish is so silky smooth and sweet that I didn't realize the entire experience was over, until it was. Alas, BCBCS will tease and intrigue forever, and I shall continue touts for her now more than ever. One taste is both my original sin and my eternal condemnation... 1,000 charactersJohnParadee, Dec 25, 2013

A: An aggressive pour into the snifter glass from the created a finger tall mocha color head made of fine bubbles that quickly fell into the blackness. A fine ring of foam was left around the edge of the glass and when swirled it kicked up legs that would make a sailor blush. Black as the deepest pit of despair, this beer actually sucks light from the room. 
S: Big complex aroma on this, giving j00se a run for its money. Dark chocolate, espresso, cold coffee, vanilla, roasty notes, and bakers cocoa to name a few. No alcohol detected in the nose at colder temperatures, but as it warms up its noticable. 
T: Huge flavor. Dark chocolate, espresso beans, vanilla, caramel, toffee flavors coming through in different intensities (mostly in that order), with an overall sweet profile. The barrel flavor is there but doesn't come through as distinctly as with the standard BCBS, but it seems to emphasis the coffee/espresso flavors better that way. As the beer warms up the flavors come through even mellower and silkier. Hop flavor and bitterness is low and neutral but enough to keep it in the background. As it warms up also getting a smokey note.
M: Silky smooth mouthfeel with a huge body as it washes over your tongue. Carbonation is low but enough to give it a little oomph. There is an alcohol warming sensation as its being sipped to remind you its in the 13% range. Also a little mouth drying sensation from the oak.
O: I could sip on this for daaays, but alas.. my only bottle. Huge Stout with a chocolate/vanilla/caramel forward malt bill with a subtle barrel character mixed with a great espresso/coffee flavor, how could you go wrong. 1,693 charactersguityler83, Dec 24, 2013

Review from notes
Goose Island's BCBCS is one of the few highly-rated beers that seems to mesh well with my palette. The beer is a sweet, tangy stout with upfront coffee that fades quickly into rich chocolate and bourbon with a tangy sweetness. Ethanol is present, but not extreme. One of the few bourbon-barrel beers that wasn't a huge mess of hot bourbon eclipsing all other flavors. Would enjoy again if ever encountered.
Pours a 1cm tall head of dark tan bubbles, with average retnetion, bubbles small in size. Fades to a thin ring around the glass without any lacing. Body is dark brown to black, opaque, light gives a dark amber-brown hue to the very edges of the beer. Carbonation not visible.
Aroma of chocolate syrup with stale roasted coffee beans, very rich and robust, touches of bourbon, vanilla, and charred toast. No noticeable ethanol. Very good, though this could be even more intense and I wouldn't mind.
Front of palate features strong coffee, chocolate syrup, sweetened tangy, mild, but growing bourbon as this migrates to mid-palate. Mid-palate finds bourbon, vanilla, chocolate syrup, modest coffee (less than I'd expect), and ethanol. Fairly rich, with bourbon, chocolate, and ethanol being most dominant. Back of palate experiences strong bourbon and ethanol with moderate vanilla and weak chocolate and charred malt. Aftertaste of ethanol, bourbon, mild chocolate syrup.
Beer is medium-heavy to heavy in body, with medium-low carbonation, leading to a slightly fizzy, then slighty foamy and smooth mouthfeel with obvious ethanol heat and burn. The ethanol is felt across the palate, as expected for an ABV of this degree, with modest heat in the nostrils. Closes dry, with substantial stickiness lingering on the palate. 1,834 charactersfalloutsnow, Dec 23, 2013

Appearance- Black. Quick thin mocha head. Poured vigorously, but nothing happened.
Smell- Coffee, chocolate, light booze, some whiskey-esque notes, some plum and cherry, light vanilla. Heavy coffee.
Taste- Tastes like regular BCBS with a splash of coffee. Not as coffee heavy as I was expecting. More cocoa, vanilla, dash of mint. Something else is there that I cant put my finger on (something fruity)? No booze taste, but still a little too sweet for my liking.
Mouthfeel- Very thick, decently hot, medium carbonation. 
Overall- An good coffee stout, but I honestly don't see the hype. Would never pay the price to buy this, but glad I finally got to try one. The bourbon countys are just too sweet for me. 786 charactersSeanniek91, Dec 23, 2013

Rich roasted coffee in the nose, with vanilla and bourbon - quite fantastic.
Less coffee in the taste than I expected, but still present. Vanilla and bourbon quite prominent. Oak and roasted notes as well. A little boozy heat, but blends well - certainly wouldn't guess this is 14%. No off notes of any kind.

Smell: Loads of fresh roasted coffee alongside notes of bourbon, cocoa and vanilla. The bourbon notes really come out as it warms.
Taste: A perfect mix of cocoa, sweetened coffee and vanilla up front followed by delicious bourbon notes in the middle before ending with just a light amount of dark roasted malt at the finish. Aftertaste is mostly sweet with just a hint of bitterness and a touch of coffee. Extremely well-balanced beer. The alcohol is very well hidden.
Mouthfeel: Full-bodied with a good amount of carbonation. There is a mild alcohol burn as it goes down due to the ABV. Just a touch thinner than I'd expect from a big stout like this. 
Drinkability: Excellent drinkability. A very smooth beer that goes down way too easily for 13.4% ABV.
Overall: World class beer overall. The hype behind this one is there for a reason. It's amazing and I'm glad I got a chance to try it. This is truly one of the best beers I've ever had the privilege of drinking. If you get a chance, this beer is absolutely worth seeking out. 1,345 charactersadam42381, Dec 21, 2013

A – Deep black with no light and a minimal head. Some nice mahogany tones emerge as the glass empties and the light is able to fight its way through.
S – A firm coffee smell but followed closely by chocolate, bourbon and vanilla.
T – Again, coffee is up front but it’s followed closely by bourbon, chocolate and vanilla without any dominating. So incredibly smooth!!! This is such as deep, complex and thought provoking brew. The 13% alcohol is well hidden though it emerges more and more as it warms.
M – Silky smooth with a nice low carbonation. The perfect vehicle for the flavors.
O – Outstanding! The best Bud I’ve ever had. 740 charactersGJ40, Dec 21, 2013

The aroma is loaded with coffee plus some hints of oak, chocolate, dark fruit and alcohol. The coffee is dark roast and somewhat burnt.
Each sip of this full bodied beer is chewy, creamy and a little oily. The flavor is loaded with dark roast coffee, chocolate, oak, vanilla, dark fruit, and an earthy nuttiness. It finishes a little bitter with some medicinal alcohol. The booze reminds me of cough syrup. Once gone the coffee, dark fruit and alcohol lingers on the palate.
Definitely a sipping beer. Tons of flavor and alcohol. It's a bit of a Catch-22 beer. It should be cellared for a while to mellow the alcohol, but if you cellar it the coffee will fade. 828 charactersWanderingFool, Dec 20, 2013

S - Coffee, coffee, roasted coffee, burnt coffee, and bourbon. I'm reminded of the coffee aisle in the grocery store where people grind their own coffee. Delicious.
T - Starts with a very sweet coffee flavor, finishing with burnt coffee and bourbon.
M - Surprisingly fizzy, considering the flat appearance. Very slightly syrupy, but reasonably clean. A medium-strong alcohol burn. 
O - This is the most coffee-forward beer I have had. With the exception of coffee, and bourbon, I'm not picking up a lot of other flavors. This leaves me feeling like I just had a strong cup of black coffee. This would probably be amazing with some age on it, mellowing the extreme coffee, and the alcohol burn. 774 charactersScotNH, Dec 20, 2013

Aroma: Big coffee notes are immediately apparent. Smooth, chocolatey, vanilla-y, woody, roast-y, coffee grounds. I could smell this beer all day.
Taste: Bourbon flavors are more apparent, but very smooth and nicely integrated with coffee flavors. Finishes with more coffee and chocolate notes, super long.
Mouthfeel: Full bodied, low carbonation, seems somewhat less viscous than normal Brand Stout.
Overall: Spectacular. Coffee flavors are very present, but blend very nicely with bourbon and roast-y malt flavors. Very curious to see how this one ages, glad I got a four pack. 756 charactersjhawth, Dec 20, 2013

4.89/5  rDev +6.8%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Poured from a bottle into a Founders snifter. The beer pours out quite black, opaque, and viscous (no light getting through here, thank you). There is a thin film of dark brown head that quickly retreats to the rim of the surface. The nose has a killer coffee aroma. It is strong, rich, and very fragrant. It does not smell like cold coffee, it smells like the most amazing cup of coffee you've ever had. Along with the coffee, there is a slight vanilla-like creaminess and some oak.
Full body, slick and oily feel, and a flavor so delicious, it's difficult to put it into words. The beer is bursting with rich, liqueur-like coffee flavors all over the palate. Up front, the coffee mixes with the sweet and roasty malt notes right out of the starting gates, giving the beer a tremendous flavor. The bourbon comes in around mid-palate, but doesn't dominate. It joins in the battle between rich, roasty, sweet, and bitter and just ratchets everything to a completely different level. Still, the coffee reigns supreme. In the back of the palate, the alcohol warmth really hits home and warms your entire body. But wait, it looks like bourbon brought a date to this party: vanilla! It waltzes in and tries valiantly to defeat the coffee, and fails. The coffee, bourbon, and hint of vanilla are left lingering behind on the finish, while the alcohol dries out your palate and urges you to drink more.
This is my 554th review and, to date, this is the best beer I have had. Sometimes with these rare, classic, highly sought-after beers, your first experience with it blows your mind and subsequent encounters, while still enjoyable, are a bit of a letdown in comparison. With that in mind, there's something fitting about only managing to get one bottle of this (actually two, but it's a long story why I only got to drink one). I'll always have this one experience with this beer to compare every other beer to. Now if you still think that means I won't try like hell to land more of this the next time it gets released, you're crazy!
First, it was BCBS. Then Zombie Dust. Then KBS. Now BCBCS has set the bar higher still. Who will challenge and become the next champion of my palate? 2,182 charactersdeadonhisfeet, Dec 20, 2013

Aroma, Strong dark roast coffee. Lesser roast malt. Some fudge and woody barrel.
Taste, Roast malt and fine coffee up front. Toffee, vanilla, oak, over ripe red fruit. A brown sugary like barrel. It all lingers very nicely. Opens up really well with some more warmth.
About full body, not as full as the stardard though. A fine carbonation similar to what was in the barleywine. Comes off silky smooth and nearly creamy. Maybe just a tad warm, but not overly so for the abv.
Not sure this is better than the original, but it could be considered a nicely diffent equal. 639 charactersBung, Dec 19, 2013

The head is a dark beige while the body is an opaque and dark chocolate black. No lacing has been left behind. Head is so dark that it's almost purplish. 
Nose- Coffee, coffee, and coffee. And it's good coffee although I wish there were different notes. Thought I caught a bit of chocolate and caramel but his is really all about the coffee. This is like sticking your head into a bag of fresh coffee beans. 
Taste- Starts off very smooth with a touch of chocolate and caramel and then moves into coffee notes representative of the nose. This is straight up coffee for the most part and honestly I want more complexity or at least, as much complexity as you would get from Stone or Great Divide's Espresso. I appreciate coffee but I don't drink it because of the caffeine so this is somewhat lost on me. It's great coffee, don't get me wrong but I want more. It's been a while since I've had the regular Bourbon County but that is so much more complex in my mind. Very mellow and smooth but pretty one-dimensional. A little bit of heat but pretty tame for 13.4%. This is about as warm and as open as it can be so I don't see any much more complexity coming out. This is strictly coffee. Great coffee but none of the other flavors that make a great Imperial Stout. This seems to be a slight grade higher than Founder's Breakfast but lesser than Stone's Espresso or Great Divide's Oak Aged Espresso. It does not seem as if it would improve with age (it's very mellow right now) so I will have no problem giving my other bottle to a friend in need. 
Mouthfeel- Between medium bodied and heavy bodied with light carbonation. Perfect for the style. Very coffee in texture as well. 
Drinkability- Very easygoing and very deceptive. There's only a light amount of alcohol present and the coffee is exquisitely balanced. 5-6 bucks a bottle isn't so bad for such a hyped release. 
Overall- Really good to great beer but doesn't come close to the hype. I don't even think this would have a chance at my top 10 Imperial Stouts much less being the highest ranked Imperial Stout on the top 250. What hype will do. Still worth a try and worth chasing after. Just don't be too disappointed if you don't get it. Spend your energy on Parabola or KBS- those beers are the bomb. 2,348 charactersartoolemomo, Dec 16, 2013

Pours a solid pitch black with a half finger of mocha colored foam that dissipated quickly into a light ring. Medium carbonation on the sides. Nice alcohol legs, not much lacing though. 
Aroma of strong and roasted espresso beans. Beneath that is oak, bourbon, chocolate, dark fruit and some alcohol. Smells really good, coffee is very dominant though, eclipses much of the other scents. It will be interesting to see how it changes with age
Tastes of strong upfront roast coffee followed by oak, dark chocolate, bourbon, hints of vanilla, and a flash of alcohol on the finish. Coffee is still dominant but not as powerful, very complex with more flavors coming through than the nose 
Feel very thick and heavy, stick and smooth, almost like a syrup. Drinks pretty warm, really refreshing on this cold day. Very drinkable despite how present the alcohol is
Overall a really good beer, the coffee was a bit too strong imo. Some age should take care of that, six more bottles in the cellar and hoping for more. I'll update how this guy changes 1,085 characterslordofstarside, Dec 15, 2013

A - Oil black head pour that gives a half finger head that dissipated almost immediately and leaves no lace to speak of. Nice looker.
S - Rich, black coffee beans, espresso, dark bitter chocolate, bourbon, oak
T - Intensely coffee forward which hides almost all the bourbon, espresso notes with nutty oak characteristics, some dark fruits but it's hard to pick the subtle flavors with so much coffee
M - Thick feel with some decent carbonation, some chewyness, just enough bitterness to not be oft-putting
O - An amazing coffee stout. So coffee forward that it tastes like espresso beans laced with chocolate and bourbon. There is moderate balance to the beer but prepare for mostly a bitter coffee profile with dark chocolate and fruit characteristics that finishes roasty and dry. Well done! 839 charactersrjp217, Dec 14, 2013
5/5  rDev +9.2%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Midnight black, thick pour with a quickly receding finger of head. The aroma is to die for, like sticking your head into a bag of fine, fresh roasted coffee beans. The flavor opens up, beginning with powerful espresso notes, and segueing seamlessly into deep, dark chocolate, followed by vanilla beans, and finally, lovely bourbon. The body is syrupy and rich, although perhaps a bit thinner than regular BCBS, due to the coffee infusion. The finish may also be a tad less lengthy, but the intensity is greater, as it positively envelops the palate in a crescendo of flavors. This is, hands down, my favorite coffee stout, and perhaps my favorite stout in general. Well worth the hunt. 685 charactersImpfan, Dec 14, 2013

As the mouthfeel goes, if original BCBS is a perfect 5 which I gave it, this is even better. The bitterness and roastiness from the coffee cuts out all sweetness and masks any of the 13% ABV to ZERO, finishing dry, making this the most drinkable variant of the bunch. This aspect also adds to the "Best Variant of the bunch in spades." I get the hype. 
It's perfection was also it's biggest flaw IMHO. The coffee over-powered all else. Where was the Bourbon? (Hardly noticeable) Where was the Fudge Brownie - Dark fruit base that the original BCBS brings in spades? (Hardly noticeable) I was hoping the coffee would have been balanced better with what BCBS brings to the table. A bit of age may solve this problem. 
As of now, I prefer the original. Need to revisit in a year or so. I was lucky enough to score plenty of both here in CA.
Make no mistake about it. It's a World Class beer now, but if age integrates the base beer & Bourbon into the coffee over time, another year may make this 2013 vintage the beer that deserves it's current rating....for my palate at least. 1,296 charactersRBassSFHOPit2ME, Dec 14, 2013

This pour yielded a high medium brown head that dissipated rather quickly to nothing. You can see how thick the thing is by the sound and look as you're pouring, like pouring maple syrup. Color is a dark, black. 
S- Lots of the same BCS aroma but with a coffee character that is not so strong as to drowned out the stout. Butter toffee, vanilla, alcohol and coffee are all big and in balance with each other. 
T- Similar to nose, all the beer flavors are big enough to match the high ABV. With that said I think the beer would be better at closer to 11% than in the mid 13%s. Coffee, alcohol, vanilla, dark dried fruit, and buttered toffee all hit you at once. A real assault on your tongue but smoother to me than regular BCS. 
M- Nice thick viscosity but not as thick as BCS was to me. The coffee makes this one more easy to drink but the ABV kind of works against that. 
O- This is the first time I've gotten to try this beer. A phenomenal beer truly one of the worlds best beers. It seems to be hard find and with the wider Goose Island distribution less of it is coming to local places and I only was able to get one bottle. But I feel lucky to have this one bottle for it is an amazing beer. 1,432 charactersPaulyB83, Dec 14, 2013

4.71/5  rDev +2.8%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Ink black body that started with a thick head that quickly faded to a thin, tan head. Dark roasted malts with an excellent coffee component; additional touches of bitter chocolate. Robust, chewy, extremely flavorful tastes: cocoa, molasses, anise and licorice with a nice underlying touch of alcohol warmth. Heavy body with a smooth, velvety feel; semi-sweet/dry finish.
My first experience with this bee is with this 2013 release. I can understand the high appeal of this gargantuan dark ale if past releases have been similar. Flavor is king to me, and this one deserves a rarely given “5” in that department with color (ok, so there's no sub-category for color, but it was near perfect as far as appearance goes) and aroma scores up there, too. If only the head would have been thicker and longer lasting, or even traces of lacing on the glass, and some of my lower “4” ratings may have gotten bumped up a quarter or even half point. Ah, but when you have incredible taste overall, these minor gripes are just that. Think I'll pursue the rest of my glass with an eye-rolling satisfaction while jazz tunes float in the background... 1,143 charactersbeergoot, Dec 14, 2013

The beer pours an inky, midnight black, much like regular BCBS, a dark tan head briefly forms and then fizzles away to a scrim; the head is slightly lighter than the head that forms on BCBS. In body, the beer is thick, viscous, and opaque, and when swirled, the beer leaves a brief set of alcoholic legs on the glass. On the nose, the beer shows its departure from regular BCBS. Rich fruity coffee buffets the nose with just a trailing hint of spicy solvent and alcohol. The coffee smells of a beautiful medium roast, moving from cocoa beans, to touches of vanilla, dark chocolate, earth, cinnamon, nutmeg, and even a touch of chili powder as the coffee interacts with the spicy alcohol. This beer has a truly delicious nose to it, reminiscent of sticking your head inside a bag of fresh coffee beans. The stout beneath the coffee does get a little confused in the richness of the coffee, blending in places, and muting in others, but I’m not all that disappointed by that as I see this beer’s nose as a vast improvement over the boozy BCBS. The barrel is light in the nose, but seems to be contributing to the vanilla notes, and perhaps also the slight boozy notes. On the tongue, the beer tastes richly complex, blending fruity coffee, rich bourbon barrels, and boozy stout. Sweetness pairs well with the bitters of the coffee, creating a nearly chocolaty sweetness, while rounded tannins lightly touch the finish and provide mild structure in the mouth. Coffee acidity is also present, giving the beer a slight tingle. In flavor, this beer is far superior to BCBS at this age. Rich, fruity coffee beautifully blends with the barrel as the beer touches the tongue bringing fresh medium roast coffee, prunes, earth, and rich dark chocolate flavors. Vanilla and soft oak dance alongside the coffee notes as faint roasted malt character is sensed along the edges of the flavor. As the beer splashes over the back of the throat, hot alcohol does come through, providing spicy notes of cinnamon to coincide with the rich coffee flavors as the coffee is slightly muted. The finish is briefer than BCBS, bringing notes of raw coffee beans, and then freshly brewed coffee, as well as spicy alcohol. In the mouth, the beer is full and slippery, feeling thinner than BCBS but still full with a silky mouthfeel and weak carbonation. The beer remains chewy and luscious, though the coffee has certainly diluted the initial fullness of the beer. Alcohol is smooth and warming, with just a touch of bite. Overall, I like this beer more than I like BCBS. I’ll admit that part of that is how the coffee hides the alcoholic bite in this beer, but I’m also a coffee-lover and the coffee flavors found in this beer are rich and complex, beautifully blending with the barrel aging. This beer is not KBS, however close it might come, and does still carry some booziness in the finish. I wouldn’t age this bottle for more than a couple months, seeing as how the awesome coffee flavors will die out, but I would certainly advise picking up a bottle and trying this puppy out. Good stuff. 3,090 charactersMaxwell, Dec 11, 2013

A: Motor oil black. A half inch of lively and bubbly brown head crackles out after a short time. No surprise given the abv and barrel aging. No real lacing.
S: Potent coffee aromas. Freshly roasted coffee beans in all their nutty and roasty glory. Rich undertones of mocha, fudge sauce, and German chocolate cake. Warm blanket of bourbon, barrel char, and caramel. Some fig and raisin darkfruit, hint of alcohol. 
T: Dark caramel, thick fudge, mocha. Bourbon and woody/barrel char tastes bring a lot of flavor, but do so gently, without any heat or kick. Wave of semi sweet dark chocolate. Tight estery blackberry peaks out for just an instant. Rich roasted coffee comes roaring to the forefront middle to end with nutty and roasty flavors of its own. Eternal finish of coffee roast, chocolate, and a kiss of roasty smoke.
M: Thick, rich body. Slick, rolling smoothness. Low carbonation. Bourbon brings a lot of that soothing, chest numbing warmth, but no heat whatsoever. 
O: A decadent treat to be sure. It isn't so much about complexity as it is a seamless melding of a handful of delicious and comforting flavors. The hefty malt body is silky smooth, and tempers any bite that the bourbon barrel brings. This is a very big and sweet beer, but still highly drinkable. It is this ease of drinkability that sets it apart from other beers of its ilk. 1,396 charactersryan1788a5, Dec 11, 2013

Pours as dark as can be with no head. Smell is very strong of coffee, overpowering anything and everything else that the base has to offer. I love coffee, but this is a bit much. Taste is similar, but I do get a little more of the delicious chocolate and bourbon that I love so much about BCBS. Mouthfeel is slightly higher carbed than I expect for such a high ABV. Overall, I'm slightly disappointed in this based off of the hype and total rating. I do my best not to have raised expectations based on what everyone else thinks, but I did have high hopes for this. I like coffee, and I do like a handful of coffee beers, this is takes the coffee a little too far. 718 charactersroger617, Dec 10, 2013

Goose Island had a phenomenal product.  Then they sell out to Inbev and change the bottles.  And the result is infected beers.  Do better.

The color is just black with little to no head.
The aroma is of sweet vanilla coffee. Just big and complex. You definitely get some bitter chocolate too, but the sugary sweetness really does come through to mask the bitterness of that chocolate. There's also spicy pepper in there too. 
The flavor is so darn complex. It’s sweeter and smoother than BCBS. It coats the mouth nicely. The roasted malt, coffee, vanilla, and bitter chocolate hides the booze quite well. It does this job better than the BCBS with taming the booze and dealing with the sweetness because of the coffee bitterness. Then the finish has clearly some bourbon.
Then again, having for the third time on tap, it still is quite a "hot" beer. The alcohol quickly hit my nose set my back a bit in my seat. I would love to have a bottle of this and give it a year to die down.
The mouthfeel is like silk and luscious, but very sticky. The beer is almost like cough syrup with its thickness and big body.
One of the my favorite beers ever.
(Adding this as review of 2013)
The aroma is definitely a lot more subdued. Less of an aggressive coffee and chocolate aroma. The base beer obviously is still there with tons of sticky vanilla, chocolate, bourbon, heat in the back. A fudgey brownie. A bit of mocha coffee. A dried boozy chocolate fruit candy.
The first thing I notice is a substantial bite and heat, and sweetness. That familiar coffee note, but not as big as 2012. There's maple syrup and vanilla. Tons of dried dark cherry! A hint of apple. 
A chewy chocolate on the end. Oak drying and alcohol on the end. 
Having this by the way with the actual coffee used, Los Immortales, is an incredible experience. I would say I prefer 2012 though. 1,729 charactersdar482, Dec 09, 2013

Pours like oil, black as night with no head and a tan lacing ring around the glass. Looks like a thick stout. Pretty looking beer, but nothing perfect, even though it gets close. The smell is a summed up by the following words three words. "Bag of coffee." That might seem like a bold statement, and I thought for sure there would be more to it. Nope, still a bag of coffee. I don't really notice the bourbon characteristic of it on the smell. The best part? The coffee smells PERFECT. By far the most aromatic beer I have ever had the pleasure of breathing in. The taste is just other-worldly. Huge coffee and bourbon vanilla up front. I don't get any other flavors, and I really don't want to, to be honest. Sure there is a roasted malt and chocolate flavor with the slightest of dark fruits if you look hard enough. There is no point to do that here. Coffee and vanilla. It works well enough for me to give it a perfect score for taste. As for the mouthfeel, what did you expect from a BB Stout by Goose Island? Silky smooth, coats the mouth, light carbonation and no alcohol burn at 13.4%. Yeah, this is as good as it gets.
Overall? The best beer I have had to date by a rather large margin. I'm actually upset that I only have 1 bottle to enjoy for now. This is about as perfect as beer gets for me as of 12/8/13. 1,355 charactersTitans77, Dec 09, 2013

First time having this one. Very excited to see the expanded Goose Island distro.
A: Jet black with just a few tiny dark beige bubbles around the outside. Just a beautiful imperial stout
S: Smells like a fresh pot of coffee with lots of chocolate and roasted notes. Hints of vanilla and barrel, but not quite as much as I was expecting. Very well blended and balanced. Even at 13+ abv, there is little to no alcohol smell. One of, if not the best smelling beers I've ever had!
T: Lots of dark fruits in the middle like fig. Chocolate and roasty notes as well as some vanilla and barrel. I don't pick up any alcohol in the taste, which surprised the hell out of me at this high of abv and being so fresh.
M: Very smooth with some prickly carbonation at the end. Alcohol, but only in a warming way, not harsh at all. I could see myself putting down a few of these if I wasn't careful, or wasn't a college kid with little income.
O: Wow! what I great beer! I have waited patiently for a few years hopeing to get my hands on this. Idk how it compares to previous vintages, but I don't see how it could get much better. I have not had the regular BCBS yet because I thought the coffee may die quicker in this one and at 14 ABV, I think I may lay them down for a little while. Can't say enough good about this beer. Happy I can look forward to this every year from now on. InBev better not F up such a good thing! Overall its a five and I can't wait to try the BCBS and BCBBW I have waiting! 1,527 characterstigerbeer90, Dec 08, 2013

The beer pours a black, oily, viscous liquid that creates a finger thick, highly carbonated head that's khaki-colored. The head quickly dissipates, leaving only traces atop the liquid.
The smell is intensely coffee-heavy, like a whiff of fresh ground beans. There's a stout roast aroma here. Some subtle malts are a bit buried underneath the coffee, but still present. Knowing the booze this beer contains, it's truly incredible that there's no booze on the nose.
On the tongue, a lot of things come alive here. The coffee is obvious, but there's malt profiles, some strong vanilla flavor, and a tasty baker's chocolate finish. As on the nose, there isn't the slightest trace of booze. At the finish, some of the bourbon characteristics show, with some oak and spice. 
I'll keep emphasizing how well disguised the alcohol is in this brew. The beer is viscous, malty, and relatively smooth. It's an awful lot like drinking coffee more than a beer.
Overall, an excellent beer worthy of the hype bestowed upon it. If more easy to get a hold of, I'd drink this regularly. 1,123 charactersONovoMexicano, Dec 08, 2013

s: I am amazed at how potent the coffee smell is. This doesn't smell like a cup of coffee, this smells like a coffee roaster hard at work. Rich coffee with some mocha notes and well incorporated bourbon. Hints of vanilla as well. Just incredible.
t: I am just floored by the strong coffee presence. Plenty enough to easily stand up to a big, rich, chocolatey stout. The bourbon barrel is certainly noticeable and more than welcome, but it isn't the dominant feature as with most barrel aged beers. Extremely satisfying.
m: Thick and oily; gently carbonated for the first half, near flat for the second. A minor beef.
o: I had high hopes for this that were easily surpassed. I just may have to chase the hype train again next year. 792 charactersDIM, Dec 08, 2013

Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a CBS snifter. This was served at cellar temperature.
A) It's all been said.... Motor oil... Blah... Blah... Blah... Dark Tan head that quickly dissipates. Looks thick...
S) My goodness... What an incredible aroma. The coffee is so intense. It's as if I have been transported to a coffee house, but instead of eating an overpriced scone, and being surrounded by assholes working on horrible screenplays, I'm in my home drinking an amazing beer. The aspects of the barrel aging are present as well in the aroma. It just doesn't get any better than this.
T) The coffee is very very present in the taste but not as strong as the aroma would indicate. There are very nice bourbon and vanilla notes in the flavor. A bit oaky... A little warmth from the alcohol, but my goodness it is so drinkable.
M) Full bodied... Nobody does barrel aging better than Goose Island, especially from a mouthfeel standpoint. So smooth... So supple... Soft carbonation. A wonderful aftertaste of bourbon and coffee. 
O) This is world class. Obtain this beer and enjoy it. Cheers.... 1,146 charactersRoamingGnome, Dec 07, 2013

A: Identical to BCBS, jet black with a very thin khaki head that remains intact. Nice chunky lace line the snifter.
S: Amazing, I pick up tons of alcohol, oak, vanilla, and then rich dark roast coffee. More oak and some chocolate, incredibly well rounded and complex.
T: Up front notes of oak, caramel, vanilla, and chocolate with nice touches of coffee. Definite alcohol taste but nowhere near as hot as the nose would suggest. The coffee adds an incredible dimension to an already impeccable barrel aged stout, but yes, I did expect a bit more coffee.
M: Full bodied and silky smooth and creamy with a noticeable alcohol burn. This one is a sipper and a treat, but the alcohol doesn't detract as much as you'd expect.
O: Fantastic beer, and to me, slightly better than the original. I honestly expected a bit more coffee, but this was still great and did not disappoint. I just wish I had more bottles! 954 charactersMikecap, Dec 07, 2013

There is simply nothing that I can even fathom that would make this beer one iota better. Silky smooth, deep, complex dark coffee in every sip and sniff and warm bourbon throughout. The absolute epitome of what a coffee stout should be. I cannot even do it justice trying to describe it so I will leave it with simply this: One of the best beers on the planet.

4.92/5  rDev +7.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 512 oz. bottle, with bottled on date November 15, 2013 printed on the label. This is some pretty fresh Bourbon County right here. I was lucky enough to score one bottle of each of the five varieties this year. This will be my fourth this year, and my first encounter with this variant. Exponentially stoked to have this bottle. Expectations are interstellar.
Poured into a clear balloon snifter.
A - Pours a thick rich oily black colored body with no head. Conjures about a half finger of dark mocha head when swirled in the glass.
S - Holy hell, this thing smells amazing. Beautiful rich dark freshly ground coffee bean roast, decadent silky vanilla, chocolate, cream, and bourbon alcohol heat. Some seriously amazing smelling beer.
T - Amazing. Every bit as good as the original beer, with all the added goodness of dark bitter roasted Intelligensia coffee beans. Silky creamy vanilla, earthy oak wood, sticky sweet caramel, powdery chocolate / cocoa, and mild bourbon alcohol warmth.
M - Feel is silky smooth & creamy, with some caramel stickiness, mild alcohol warmth, and bitter chocolate / coffee bean roast clinging to the palate. Delicious.
Overall, this beer is a true work of art. This is going to be at the top of my ratings list, that is for damn sure, and I'm okay with that. Every bit as delicious and amazing as the original beer, with an extra layer of authentic coffee added. This is truly going to be the pinnacle of all beer for me for quite awhile now; between this beer and the original, they are going to be hard to top.

4.66/5  rDev +1.7%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75No head on a jet black body. Very simple appearance, not much to it. Aroma is dominated by coffee but like the base beer its a bit mild for what I want. Aroma has coffee, dark fruits, Smoked malts and little else. This basically smells like a freshly opened bag of dark roast. Flavor is much better and much more dynamic than the aroma. I am getting vanilla, lots of dark roast coffee of course, some milk chocolate, little booze for ABV and peat/roasted malts. The coffee competes with the bourbon making it slightly less apparent than the base beer which is too bad. The body seems lighter than the base beer to me having had them back to back but still full with light to moderate carbonation. Still though the feel can't get better. excellent combo of stout, coffee and bourbon. Doesn't get much better. 807 characterskylehay2004, Dec 07, 2013

2013 Vintage bottled 11/15.
Pours a heavy deep black color with very little tan colored head. Appearance is that of used motor oil, probably just as thick too. There is absolutely no transparency to this one. 
Smell is very rich. First I detect sweet booze and roastyness, followed by the coffee. 
Taste is everything it smells. The coffee flavor is right up front, followed by the roasty flavor and booziness. There is definitely some intensity to the flavor, the coffee really adds a lot to it.
This one has a oily, heavy viscous feel to it. 
Overall, I prefer this to the original BCBS. The coffee is a nice addition. I don't know if I'd necessarily call it mind-blowing, but it certainly is a great stout. I wish I had been able to get more than 1 bottle so I could try it with some age. 838 charactersd5001986, Dec 07, 2013

'
Poured into a stemmed tulip glass from the 12 oz. bottle.
a: Black, skinny tan head disappeared almost immediately, leaving a thin ring.
s: Bourbon. Later, coffee becomes more prominent.
t: Coffee over booze. The coffee flavor masks any bourbon taste, but you definitely taste alcohol, and feel it on the tongue and going down. Naturally it starts tasting even better after it's mostly inside my body. Caffeine is definitely not neutralizing the effects of the 13.4% alcohol.
m: Light to moderate. Sexy silky smooth. 
o; Excellent coffee stout. Surprisingly light mouthfeel for a stout. Seems the main contribution of the bourbon barrel aging besides the initial aroma is the higher ABV. 716 charactersscotorum, Dec 06, 2013

Pours a motor oil black with a thin chocolate head that fizzles away rather quickly. Almost no signs of lace along the sides of the glass. The aroma is of strong coffee with a slight hint of boozy bourbon. This aroma would be comparable to taking a big whiff of a bag of fresh coffee beans. Taste is right in line with the smell, strong notes of fresh coffee with the slightest touch of bourbon and vanilla. Perfection. Super warm mouthful from the 13.4% ABV, but is smooth and well balanced. Wow, this is a prime example of how a coffee stout should be. The base beer is amazing, but with the addition of coffee beans this beer jumps up to the elite standards. 724 charactersbrian44556, Dec 06, 2013

A: The beer is a deep black color, with a very thin light brown head that fades quickly and leaves a thin lace on the glass.
S: The aroma contains black coffee and roasted malts, which is all that’s needed for this beer.
T: The taste starts out with a huge black coffee flavor that is followed by a rich roasted malt character. There’s just enough sweetness and hops to create a very good balance for such a big stout. The after-taste is bitter-sweet.
M: Crisp and smooth, medium body, medium carbonation, finish is dry and slightly sticky.
O: Very tasty, goes down dangerously easy, not too filling, very strong kick, excellent representation of style, this is definitely one of the best coffee beers I’ve ever had. 786 charactersTheManiacalOne, Dec 06, 2013

A - Pours pitch black, thin brown head, not much lacing/retention. 
S - Coffee is present (obviously), vanilla, oak and dark chocolate. The nose is just big hugs of coffee to me.
T - Coffee is very strong here. Very nice bourbon notes with vanilla and oak accents. 
M - Full bodied, low carbonation. Very chewy, thick and velvety body. 
O - If the coffee was this prominent after a year, it must have been really strong at first. This is such a lovely beer to drink. This is one of THE top coffee stouts ever. 549 characterscvm4, Dec 06, 2013

A-A normal pour doesn't produce much in the way of head. I get just a thin finger of dark brown foam that dissipates almost immediately. The beer leaves no lacing, but some alcoholic "legs" are visible on the glass. The beer is nearly black and possesses an interesting, oily sheen.
S-This fresh bottle has big roast coffee aroma up front. There is a touch of char and licorice, as well as some sweet, dark berry. Only when it warms up do I detect any hint of the 13.4% ABV. As the brew warms, the coffee fades to more of a rich, dark chocolate and I get some caramel and vanilla bourbon scents. 
T-The taste is also heavy on the roasted coffee bean flavor, but it never verges too far into bitter. Instead, there is a nice balancing hit of vanilla and chocolate sweetness. The mixture of flavors is mildly creamy on the mid-palate, but I get a little bit of sharp black licorice and cola flavors on the finish. The finish is impressively long on the palate.
M-The feel is a bit on the thin side for such a big, sweet beer, but it mostly works. Carbonation is low and there is an oily, coating feeling.
O-This is probably the best coffee stout I've ever had. Is it a top-5 of all-time? I don't know about that, but it is a damn good beer. The smell and flavor are pretty incredible...complex, smooth, intense, and well-integrated. The look is a little odd; a bit like actual coffee instead of beer and I was a little underwhelmed by the feel, which is on the thin side. These are pretty minor criticisms, however. I would happily drink this again. And again. And probably again. 1,647 charactersspoony, Dec 05, 2013
4.61/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.522oz bomber, dated 11/12/2012, poured into a tumbler and imbibed today, 2/1/2013.
Aroma: Full of oak and vanilla, as expected from a barrel-aged beer. There are hints of coffee and chocolate, the chocolate being surprisingly stronger than the coffee. There are also hints of some dark fruits but that is overshadowed by the oak and vanilla. Very strong nose, but dominated by just the oak and vanilla.
Colour: Pours an opaque jet black, with about 2-3cm of dark brown head that sticks around for about 3-5 minutes or so which is a long time. Laces very well, persists uniformly. It's a beautiful-looking beer.
Flavour: This is the best part of the brew. I get a lot of vanilla and oak, presumably from the barrel. But I get a good amount of actual bourbon, which is incredible. There is some black coffee, which as a black coffee drinker I appreciate very much. There is some dark chocolate in there, presumably from the roasted malt. Not much bitterness- it's full of chocolatey vanilla, coffee, roast malts and bourbon. It's a palate's wet dream. 
Mouthfeel: While the flavour is the best part of the brew, this characteristic is definitely a very strong part of the brew. It's a superbly thick-bodied stout, decently carbonated as expected for an imperial stout. It's nicely dry, and for some reason it seems to really combine what I expect of drinking a beer vs drinking some bourbon on the rocks. The aftertaste is definitely of bourbon, oak and vanilla in a combination and doesn't linger long- making you want to drink some more of that goodness. Surprisingly, for a 15% ABV brew, I don't feel as much heat here either even as it gets warmer.
Overall: I definitely see why people consider this beer to be world-class. It's actually distinct to the BCBS and I'm very happy I had the chance to get my hands on two bottles of this brew. I'll probably age the other bottle for a year and see how things go, but I'm looking forward to drinking it along with a 2013.
Re-review: Cracked open a 2013 vintage bottle today, 12/4/2013. Poured into an original Bourbon County snifter.
Looks like any BCBS would, comes with a friggin' lovely 2cm brown head that drops into totally nothing. No lacing, very placid beer after the head drops. And yeah, it smells great. Oaky, bitter, acidic and full of black coffee mixed in with a crapload of bourbon chocolate. It also tastes fantastic as well, although I will note that it wasn't as impressive cold, but when it warms up it is something else. Full of slick sweet bourbon chocolate flavour balanced out by bitter black coffee, with a dash of barrel vanilla flavours. That's what makes this beer that damn good.. mouthfeel is typical slick, full bodied BCBS, zero heat in this beer. And overall, it's the same BCBCS that its always been, you know what you're getting with it. I would not age this beauty.
Re-re-review: Cracked open a 2014 vintage bottle today, 12/1/2014. Poured into an original Bourbon County snifter. For the most part, this beer is as it has always been. Rich bourbon, milk chocolate, more bourbon, balanced out by a nice clean acidic coffee flavour. Better as it warms up. Gets more barrel flavours as it warms up although when it gets room temperature warm, it's not quite as good. So I would enjoy it at cellar temperature when possible. Good mouthfeel, a bit thinner than my memory of previous vintages, but slick and with no heat. Fantastic coffee stout, the best one out there, really. 3,461 charactersStevedore, Dec 05, 2013

Pours black with a dark brown head about half an inch thick that retreats to a small ring quickly. When swirled the beer leaves a thin brown film behind. Looks sticky sweet. Smeels like bourbon, vanilla, coffee, chocolate and toffee. I wish the coffee was coming through more. First sip had bourbon, a bit of vanilla and chocolate and a hint of coffee. The more I drank, the more pronounced the bourbon became and the coffee diminished. Halfway through the coffee was gone. The mouthfeel was okay, a bit thin for such a big beer, I was expecting to have to chew this one like a do yeti, but it wasn't the case. All in all this has been my favorite bourbon county varient, however I would grab an espresso oaked yeti before grabbing this one again.
Edit, just revisited this fresh, 12oz bottle poured into duvel tulip.
Same color and appearance, much more coffee and bourbon this go around on the nose and in flavor. Way better fresh on this beer. Gotta bump my ratings up now... 1,029 charactersSFACRKnight, Dec 04, 2013

Years ago, Inflatablechair hooked our tasting group with the 22's of this one plenty of times. Tonight a '13 12oz is all mine. A short-lived dark brown head rises only about a quarter inch up and dies very quickly... the brew pours thick and very smooth.
The nose is for the most part hammered with coffee beans... not "ground coffee" but cracked coffee beans... there is a nice cocoa element that doesn't really rise up until things warm considerably... the bourbon/barrel presence is not as much as I remember in the 1st batch, but it is still certainly present.
Flavor mirrors the nose with a strong dark fruity element.. a big figgy component that adds needed sweetness... the malts help balance the big coffee bean presence.. very nice chocolate waves sorta envelope the entire palate.
Huge body is no surprise... mild carbonation begs for a sip and contemplation.
Don't age this one... Not worth it.

Can’t follow the pack on this one. Disappointed might be my first reaction. Rich! 12 oz is too much for me in one sitting. Too much chocolate, needs more bitterness to balance the sweetness. An almost spiked hot chocolate sort of taste. At this point (age wise) the 2013 BCBS is better than the BCBS coffee variant. Unique and thus willing to age my remaining bottles and try again. To the cellar! 3.75

A - Standard BCBS, which means it looks amazing. 1 finger dark tan head, black as night.
S - Completely blown away. The coffee is so fresh and so delicious smelling. I was expecting good, but this is incredible. To compare this to something like KBS is blasphemous. The coffee and bourbon mixture on top of the base beer is just mindblowing.
T - Completely lives up to the smell. Incredible amounts of delicious coffee, with a nice bourbon note in there. Some roasted malt and fruity characteristics, which I'm sure are coming from both the malts and the coffee.
M - Almost perfect. I get a slight bit of heat, but it's really nitpicking at this point. The drinkability on this is also scary.

A: Deep dark black color with very little carbonation and head. No glass lacing to really speak of.
S: Heavy smell of bourbon (of course) mixed with some vanilla, coffee, chocolate and toffee and caramel.
T: The bourbon is heavy on the flavor with everything else being secondary. Other flavors of roasted malt, huge dark chocolate, toffee, vanilla, caramel, and some coffee. I'll say though the flavors of coffee are not even close to what I expected. Alcohol is always tasted but it's welcome on this monster of a beer. So complex.
M: Full, coating, thick, lasting, alcohol, huge!
O: This is a fantastic barrel aged bourbon beer that is born from it's BCBS roots. You just don't get much better in any bourbon barrel aged beer except for KBS. I must say in all honesty though I expected way more coffee flavor, in that way I was let down. Still a great beer.
Great beer, but again I feel a little short changed on the coffee. It could have been the year it sat, but still I think there should have been a much stronger coffee flavor and aroma. Again, terrific beer but I wouldn't stand in line to buy this when the regular BCBS is much more readily available. 1,262 charactersKadonny, Dec 02, 2013

A: pitch black, head quickly disappears leaving thick, black liquid.
S: Big fresh coffee notes dominates, smells incredible.
T: Amazing, huge coffee taste with the stout base to back it up. The sharpness of the coffee perfectly balances out the booziness and sweetness of the base.
M: Big, chewy, delicious, hit it right on the head. Though no head is left (probably due to coffee addition) there is decent carbonation to balance it out.
O: Can't think of a better bourbon coffee imperial stout, truly world class and worth every penny. As this is one of my favorite styles, this beer is in my top beers of all time. 634 charactersdaryk77, Dec 02, 2013

S not as big as I would have expected. Dark coffee, bourbon & vanilla. Smells good but I was hoping for a bigger nose
T amazing, wow. Incredible balance. To me its bcbs with dark coffee added which maybe is the idea. Has the bourbon flavor a la bcbs but with delicious dark coffee although the coffee presence isnt as big as I was expecting. The aftertaste could be stronger thus the slight deduction. So good.
M though not a milk shake thick coating feel, its perfect for this beer and still quite full bodied. Incredibly enjoyable
O excellent. I've been comparing it to KBS throughout the review and I'd still take KBS but the balance of this beer is incredible and it absolutely lives up to the hype. 773 charactersDrewskiWhit, Dec 02, 2013

4.46/5  rDev -2.6%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.512oz bottle poured into a 3 Stars snifter. Purchased on Black Friday a couple days ago. Reviewed from the '13 bottling.
A- Pours a pitch black with a coffee mocha head that fizzles away fairly fast, decent carbonation with fairly nice consistency. Appears exactly as regular BCS except maybe slightly more carbonation.
S- Coffee pops out immediately with a sweet, roasted aroma that blends nicely with the dark chocolate and bourbon in the background. Hints of coconut, oak, vanilla, and toffee also come out. Above average aroma strength, nicely balanced, booze well hidden, and pleasant smelling. Maybe not the best coffee stout I've smelled but definitely up there with the best.
T- Creamy dark chocolate, toffee, vanilla, malts, and hints of licorice blend with sweet lightly roasted coffee. Finishes with roasted espresso beans, coconut, vanilla beans, a bit of leather, and some toffee lingering as an aftertaste. Definitely very rich side which makes this a sipper but very tasty and well balanced.
M- Creamy, feels lightly slick on the palate, very full bodied, coffee brings some light acidity and bitterness, perfect carbonation for the style, velvety, and very smooth with just a touch of alcohol burn for the 14%.
O- I've had every vintage of BCBCS so far and none of them have disappointed so far. They easily set the standard for coffee beers. While they age nicely, I prefer them slightly more fresh. The different roasts each year bring out their own individual characteristics. The "Los Immortales" this year brings out a nice sweetness while lending a slight bitterness and acidity on the palate. 1,619 charactersjaasen64, Dec 01, 2013

Was our 3rd or 4th massive stout of the night
A - Dark as night as with most stouts pours thick and beautifully. Small quarter inch khaki foam head.
S - Smell is bourbon and coffee strong, toffee, Caramel. Delightful to the nose. hints of chocolate
T - Taste Coffee, bourbon, chocolate, Vanilla, boozy after taste. I believe the coffee has really mellowed out after being aged for 3 and a half years, close to 4.
M - Full bodied beer with low carbonation and a creamy mouthfeel.
I have not yet had KBS, or KBBS, or CBS, but so far this is my favorite coffee stout and indeed one of the best beers out there. 677 charactersdrmcleod10, Dec 01, 2013

A - Obsidian black with a thin tan ring. What lacing? I'm still going to give it a high mark because to get the flavor of this beer, appearance had to be sacrificed. 
S - This aroma is better than the coffee I brew in the morning! Espresso beans, roasted coffee and caramel. Big on the bourbon, vanilla, and chocolate. Some campfire marshmallows mixed in as well. I don't think you can improve the aroma. 
T - Espresso, cappuccino, and coffee, it's all there! Bourbon, vanilla, caramel, brown sugar, dark chocolate and cocoa. Marshmallow and toffee, with some hazelnut. So complex and so well blended together. It's all there and I can't imagine a better tasting coffee beer.
M - Smooth, rich, velvety and decadent. Carbonation is low, but I expected that since this beer has been through so much to make it what it is. 
O - There is no better coffee beer in my opinion. Almost perfect, maybe it should be? 972 charactersRi0, Dec 01, 2013

A: Black. Thin brown head, disappeared pretty quickly.
S: Could smell this one from pretty far away. Vanilla, bourbon, coffee, roasted barley. Huge and amazing aroma.
T: Same as the aroma. Dominated by barrel, bourbon and roasty malt at first. Coffee becomes more present mid way through and in the after taste. Sweet chocolate, bitter hops and coffee and smooth mellow oak all play together really nice. Just a little hot, but not in such a bad way.
M: Awesome, very viscous. I love a stout this thick.
O: Really great beer. I enjoyed it a little less than the standard Bourbon County Brand Stout. In fact, I thought it was overall extremely similar other than the slightly higher emphasis on coffee in the taste. An amazing treat! 770 charactersanteater, Dec 01, 2013

Pours really dark black with a brown head. It's dark as fuck.
Smells of coffee, bourbon, vanilla, oak, and a hint of chocolate.
WOW! This is one badass beer! Really good coffee flavor with a bit of chocolate and a lot of bourbon. Also a nice barrel finish with bitter coffee. There is less heat on this one than the original BCBS
Mouthfeel is great with perfect carbonation and a slick oily mouthfeel.
One of the best. I still prefer BCBS because it has more bourbon and oak than the coffee version. 566 charactersJDizzle, Dec 01, 2013

It's caramel colored snappy head barely rises and fades nearly just as fast. No lacing. Decent beer legs. Brew is medium viscosity and deep roasty black. The only reason I didn't give a 1 is because I know it's still BCBS, therefore it shall gain 3/4 of a point :)
Tons of heady coffee. Hazelnuts, but not fake goddy nuttyness. Chocolate, bourbon, roasty caramel malt, boom! 
Killer flavors. Coffee flavors are much different then aromas. Lots of vanilla milk chocolate mixed with 85% coco. No nasty licorice flavors. Dry, earthy, granular, "dirty", lasting, bitterness. Complex, well developed flavors. Unique and well balanced flavors. Carbonation is much higher than appearance would lead you to believe, a bit too prickly . Sweetness is dry and mild, nice. 
This is a "smart" beer. It has everything, minus a decent appearance. Flavors are great, complex, well rounded, genius. Good bourbon kick creates very nice drinkability; hard to put down. Thanks GI for brewing enough for CO, cheers!!! 1,098 characterschugalug06, Nov 30, 2013

Its black, with a light right of foam around the edges, it went away very fast. Looks just like regular BCBS.
Smell is vanilla, roasted malt, bourbon, coconut, espresso, and coffee
Taste is really nice, starts with a huge blast of coffee, then the regular BCBS notes come shining through, vanilla, bourbon, roasted notes, coconut, toffee, espresso, alcohol heat on the finish
mouthfeel is full and coating, light on the carbonation, impressive
Wowzers, this is a good one, I am glad I got a couple bottles, get them if you can! 575 charactersnickapalooza86, Nov 29, 2013

The beer pours deep black, chocolate-colored head that quickly dissipates, and a pungent chocolate-coffee aroma. The taste is dark and milk chocolate at the same time, intense coffee, burnt caramel sweetness, vanilla, tannin, and whiskey. The beer has a surprisingly light mouthfeel, and finishes with a bit of tannin and green apple.
BCBCS is the closest thing to perfection in the coffee stout style. 479 charactersDanimal25, Nov 27, 2013

A: Goose Island is great at nailing the appearance of beers and BCBCS doesn't fall short. Jet black and looks exactly like it does in advertisements and print. 
S: Big sundae parlor toffee, caramel, and coffee. Hidden behind the delicious presence of that barrel smell is just the slightest hint of booze burn. Enough to warn you that you probably shouldn't drink the whole bottle but not enough to scare you away. 
T: Alcoholism inducing...A terrifically balanced profile that begs you to drink more. A wonderful reminder of an early morning visit to Intelligentsia or an after dinner nightcap. The barrel flavor is so incredibly matched to the coffee and smoked grains that it produces unbelievable mocha, chocolate, tobacco, and oak notes. 
M: My biggest let down with Bourbon County beers is their relatively weak mouthfeel. I've always found the beers to be rather thin and lack that chewy, viscous base like KBS/Black Note. Still, easy to sip and really improves as it warms over a 45 minute period. 
O: Not much left to say, a must. 1,109 characterskylelenk, Nov 23, 2013

Aroma is loaded with roasted espresso beans, cacao, rich malt, licorice, and molasses.
Taste mirrors the dense aroma, extremely rich with roasted coffee and bittersweet chocolate, vanilla around the edges, woodiness from the barrels and the bourbon also stand out. The flavors are rich and complex, and this stout covers your palate like roofing tar. As with all stouts, a bit of warming changes the character a bit and in a good way.
Full bodied and rich, velvety smooth, a bit of heat and warming in the chest noted.
I was advised not to let this bottle go too long (dated 11/12/12) as the coffee flavors are reported to fade despite the label stating "Develops for up to 5 years in the bottle." This was the 2012 release w/La Tortuga coffee beans. Smooth and rich, bold and boozy, this is a BIG stout that has a lot to offer and comes highly recommended if you can get your hands on it. 1,025 charactersHendry, Nov 10, 2013

poured a deep black with a small tannish head. lots of roasted malt, coffee and chocolate notes. great coffee smell with a touch of alchohol in the nose. 
taste was not nearly as coffee strong as I expected but the chocolate notes of the roasted malts shined. a touch too boozy in the beginning but both the booziness and the coffee notes melded well after letting it rest and warm abit. overall a wonderful beer. 551 charactersequinox1, Oct 27, 2013

Bottled on Nov 15, 2013.
A: Slow pour into my Founders snifter created a small tan head that quickly dissipated. Looks like a thick motor oil. Minimal to no lacing throughout.
S: Coffee hits the nose immediately, with light bourbon and chocolate/espresso right behind. Unbelievable smell that I kept coming back to throughout. Honestly could not get enough.
T: Wow. This absolutely blew me away. When cellar temp, the coffee was at the forefront, but as it warmed became even more complex. Coffee led the way with dark chocolate, roast, and bourbon following close behind, but never overtaking. There is even a hint of vanilla. Mid palate everything just blended and balanced together perfectly. Alcohol becomes present as it warms from cellar temps and creates that hit towards the end like BCBS, but not as aggressive. It's been over an hour and I can still taste it like I just took a sip, unbelievable. Trust me, this one only gets better as it warms. Begin at cellar temp and enjoy the ride.
M: Thick as can be, but so smooth. Coats your mouth and lingers long after your first sip. Low to hardly any carbonation.
O: Honestly, this may be the best beer I have ever had. I can see why there is so much hype, and I am so glad I have a couple more bottles to enjoy. I did a side by side of KBS and BCBCS, with BCBCS as the clear winner. Unbelievable, world class stout. 1,455 characterssblanton83, Oct 12, 2013

4.45/5  rDev -2.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.52012 release gifted to me in January by one of the brand/sales managers of my GI distributor when I didn't get a case of it at my store like I was told. Nice gesture which was greatly appreciated. I was saving this to open with a friend or two, but since I shared most of the beer I bought in VT and the beers I bought online from Belgium, I felt like there should be one that I should enjoy myself as a little escape from the World around me.
Poured into an oversized wine glass.
AP: This is one of the blackest liquids I've ever seen. Just deep space jet black. Head originally poured nearly 2" and was fizzling and making noise like Snap, Krackel and Pop. Now it's nothing but a dusting and lacing across the surface and sides. Found a couple small white chunks of sediment floating along the surface, like crystallized or calcified yeast.
AR: Chocolate cake batter, fudge, molasses at the fore along with the alcohol heat with a bit of coffee in the background. Booze soaked dark fruits like fig, plum and raisin as well. Smells really bold and rich. 
T: The coffee flavour is secondary to most of the other flavours on this, but it's there. The alcohol, while you can feel it's warmth, is fairly well hidden the the taste and doesn't cut through any of the flavours. Flavours are very rich and decadent. Chocolate, fudge, boozy dark fruits, molasses, rum raisin cake and a bit of vanilla. 
M: Despite the fizzing sounds after the pour there was very little carbonation to this, which is fine with me as I like my RIS chewy. This was chewy and fairly full bodied, a bit of a silky feel on the palate. A bit of a lingering slight cloying aspect on the finish, but nothing off putting. otherwise finish is rather clean.
OV: A very good Stout, though not the mind blowing experience others have stated about this beer. Not enough coffee flavour for me, though you can usually cellar high octane brews like this for 6-12+ months, I've heard this one can lose some of it's coffee flavour past 6 months of bottling (this is probably at 11 months right now) so wonder if this is the case here. I've had FBS nearly a year old that tasted no different than one less than a month old, so no excuses for this beer. Very good, but not the coffee infused milk from angels' teets. 2,271 charactersGuinnessAtRogerWilco, Oct 09, 2013

A: 3/3 - black, no clarity, poured with mild-to-moderate carbonation and settled into a tan-brown subtle finger lacing, big alcohol legs (as expected for 14.3%)
S: 11/12 - big caramel, toffee and stone fruit with strong alcohol notes; less chocolate and coffee than expected but don't recall them exceptionally present in the base beer (Night Stalker)
T: 20/20 - on the anterior tongue, there's a moderate bitterness - dark chocolate and coffee flavors are present even if not explicit on the nose; in the middle of the mouth, the malt complexity and barrel-aged qualities perfectly predominate; --&gt; toffee, caramel, figs and stone fruit; aftertaste is an admixture of barrel-aged and chocolate/coffee qualities that persist for 5-10 seconds and invites another-and-another sip 
M: 5/5 - big chewy body, complex malts, pleasant alcohol burn, mild-to-moderate carbonation appropriate carbonation and pleasantly maintained throughout drinking
O: 10/10 - the BCBS series may the best barrel-aged imperial stouts and this beer is close to perfect at ~ 1 year; the only real detractor, I think, is the lack of advertised coffee, which, I suspect, is due to decay in the flavor/aroma over time; nevertheless, like the base beer and BCBS, this beer is worth every penny and one that I'll purchase whenever I can get my hands on it --&gt; highly recommended!

Served lightly chilled and split between my usual snifter and a BCBS snifter that I received in a trade with rfraga (thanks man!).
2012 La Tortuga Vintage
Bottle number: 0010
A massive thanks to Futura for this one. 
Appearance: BCBCS pours thick and viscous and appears pitch black in the glass, however a back light reveals a decent chunk of deep red along the edges of the glass. A rough pour yields a good sized dark tan coloured head (the best head I have seen on a BCBS varient) that displays decent retention, but doesn't leave anything in the way of lacing. A swirl coats the glass in a sticky yellow film and leaves heavy alcohol legs. 
Smell: Oh man, I can smell this from a mile away and it smells amazing! Initially there is a nice amount of coffee present, but it doesn't dominate the aroma as one might expect. The coffee is joined by a ton of vanilla laced almond cream, coffee truffle encased in dark chocolate, some sweet caramel and a little butterscotch. As the beer warms, the bitter-sweet chocolate character increases fantastically and notes of raisins, black cherry and a little alcohol are also noted.
Taste: As with the nose, the flavour isn't bursting with coffee, however that which is present is delicious and goes a long way to cutting the sweetness of the regular BCBS. Notes include: Minerally coffee (as I often get in aged coffee beers), creamy almond, vanilla, oak, dark carmel, some butterscotch, some chocolate, a fair amount of liquorice and a ton of heavy dark fruits. There is a touch of alcohol noted in the flavour, however it is far from bothersome. 
Mouthfeel: Sadly this is another BCBS variant that is over carbonated for my tastes (medium-high level), but thankfully it is quite smooth and settles down fairly quickly. The body is full and quite sticky. 
Overall: Aside from the first Rare I had, this is easily the best of the BCBS variants that I have had and I hope to be having it again soon. 1,973 charactersThehuntmaster, Sep 28, 2013

A: No head no lacing just a pitch black monster.
S: Bourbon. Roasty goodness.
T: Bourbon. Dark cherry some coffee though I wished for much more considering this was the coffee stout. If this were BCBS I'd be all for it. Just think it misses the mark with the coffee. Still absolutely delicious. Alcohol warmth comes through at the end which is not surprising considering the ABV. But I like that.
M: This is in my mind the most perfect mouthfeel for a beer. Thick, heavy, full bodied, silky smooth.
O: Fantastic beer just wanted more coffee out of it, dang nabbit. But was a pleasure to drink anyways. 659 charactersGivemebeer, Sep 17, 2013

Pitch black color, mild beige head. Smell is a mixture of bourbon, coffee and chocolate. Not too overpowering though, they all blend together very well. The taste is also a nice blend, but to me there isnt quite enough of a coffee flavor. Its there but real subdued. The flavors are all there and its definitely complex, but nothing stands out as "wow" to me. The bourbon isnt huge either, but it definitely overwhelms the coffee. Full bodied, low carbonation.
Overall a very good beer but i just wish the coffee was more pronounced. I'd say i prefer original BCBS to this.
EDIT: my above review is of over a year old version...recently had the 2013 version and the coffee was definitely more prominent. Bumping up the rating accordingly. 754 charactersAxnjxn, Sep 07, 2013

Glad to see this beer is back near the top again. Remains one of my all-time favorites.
It is so hard to come by here in the Northeast. When I'm in Chicago I search for it all around the area and even have stores reserving it for me when possible. I paid the $25 checked bag fees just to bring this back home to share with my beer buds.
2nd Review:
This ranks up there with Goose Island Bourbon County Brand Proprietor's Stout. Got to share this awesome Coffee Stout at a Alchemist Heady Topper tasting that I did in Chicago on 6/5. After the Heady Topper was gone, the guests dragged out and a couple of 12 ounce bottles of the Goose Island Bourbon County Brand Coffee Shout and a bomber of the Bruery's Black Tuesday. I rated both beers the same score, and both were top of the line brews, but I would have to give the edge to Black Tuesday. But I might have flipped the edge if I had the Black Tuesday first. Both were just a total joy to consume; especially with all my new friends that came to share my Heady Topper Tasting. 1,042 charactersricknelson, Sep 07, 2013

Aromas of earth, oak, booze, vanilla, molasses, chocolate, roast and hints of char. Very rich and robust nose. Flavors of booze forward, with a heavy bourbon/vanilla rich and sweet follow, rich molasses and roast caramel blend in the backbone, bitter and roasted coffee notes, and some oaky/earthy notes. Amazingly and delicately balanced on a rich, smooth, dense body. The aftertaste is boozy, with a rich vanilla and coffee blend giving sweet and bitter characteristics. Smooth, creamy finish, with a bittersweet linger. Amazingly drinkable, but the warmth and booze builds quickly. This is tasty! 735 charactersGarthDanielson, Aug 31, 2013

Aroma includes marshmallow, vanilla, coffee, chocolate, bourbon, some alcohol and some of those wafer cookies. Taste follow suit with some molasses notes and brandy. Thick, viscous and rediculously good. 312 charactersKickbacksSteve, Aug 22, 2013
4.27/5  rDev -6.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A 22 ounce bottle of the late 2012 batch received as a gift from fvernon; thank you good sir! Reviewed from notes taken on 6/09/2013.
Pours black and rests beneath a half-inch thick layer of brown, frothy head that resides for a couple of minutes. The aroma is of bourbon, oak, ground coffee, a bit of espresso, chocolate, vanilla, caramel, and a touch of almond and hazelnut towards the end. It tastes of bourbon, vanilla, coffee grounds, hazelnut, oak, maybe some cedar (or other dry wood), some nuts (almond, cashew), and chocolate with a nice roasted malt finish. Mouthfeel is lively, yet thick. It readily coats the mouth, but the carbonation keeps it from leaving a sticky residue. Finish is clean, but I wouldn’t call it dry. Overall, this is an impressive stout. The base beer is wonderful in its own right, and the addition of coffee adds a whole new dimension. 873 characterseclipse54, Aug 21, 2013

I can't wait to try the bottle of cherry rye that I have sitting in the cellar, to see how that compares to this. 383 charactersJimmeekrek, Aug 07, 2013

The aroma was bourbon char and coffee goodness. The beer pours jet black motor oil with a instant dissipation of a toffee caramel head.
I've had each vintage since 2011, and what I've noticed is that BCBCS needs to be c enjoyed fresh to get the full coffee flavor that is desired from this beer. This beer with age loses its coffee bourbon slam that puts this at the top of the coffee flavored realm. 492 characterscarmike813, Jul 20, 2013

The mouth feel is as good as it gets, they nailed it. This beer in NJ was $25 bucks and I would buy it again.

A - Very near black with a nice finger of chocolate colored head. OK retention and lacing.
S - Tons of super sweet chocolates and roasty sweet coffee. Vanilla, bourbon and a light but sweet dark fruit aroma
T - super sweet and alcohol burn initially. The burn lingers but transitions into a vanilla bourbon sweet roasty coffee at the finish and through the aftertaste
M - full bodied with minimal carbonation. very chewy/sticky
O - Definitely one of the best coffee stouts I've ever had. Fantastic desert beer/slow sipper
I found 2013's to be significantly more roasty, tons and tons of espresso roast mix with boozyness and make it more of a sipper than i recall 2012 being. Incredibly awesome but I'm looking forward to letting this one age 12-18 months and revisiting 781 charactersMacQ32, Jul 13, 2013

This beer has very high ABV and I don't mind that, but my thoughts they didn't do a very good job hiding the alcohol. Much too strong for my liking as the alcohol takes away the flavors of the beer. 312 charactersjacksippinstout, Jul 07, 2013

Smell: The front of the nose is bourbon heavy with dark coffee bean accents. Those accents yield to a body of strong molasses, vanilla, and bitter dark chocolate. A caramel sweetness can also be picked up. All the players in the aroma are very rounded and balanced, a real treat to take in. 
Taste: A bourbon sweetness greets the palate. The body is heavy on vanilla cream and roasted coffee beans. Toffee, dark malt, more bourbon, and caramel finish. The beer drinks incredibly clean for how massive it is. Simply awesome.
Mouthfeel: Palate punishing. Covers every inch in the mouth and refuses to not let you taste what is going on here. 
Overall: This beer brings it all. Barrel aged perfectly and has some of the most outstanding complexity a beer can have. A true gem, worth every bit of the hype and pricetag. 1,029 charactersKFBR392, Jul 05, 2013

Appearance: Coffee black with excellent brown lacing.
Smell: Coffee, bourbon, and chocolate. Tons of chocolate. Not quite as fruity as regular.
Taste/Mouthfeel: Lots of oak with coffee and chocolate. Very roasty.
Overall: There's still something about the regular Bourbon County Stout I love. Still, I really like this. 367 characterstjsdomer2, Jun 17, 2013

This was actually a side-by-side comparison with KBS. Shared with a friend.
A: Dark black with finger of bubbly amber head that retreats to an amber bubbly rim. Not much film after it settles. Not much lacing. Creamy appearance. 
S: Moderately fragrant. Dark roasted malts. Bourbon/oak. Coco. Moderate booze.
T: Follows the nose (malts>bourbon/oak>coco). Very powerful taste. Slight bitterness with coco. Hints of vanilla and coffee. The coffee had fallen off a bit. Some booze, not overpowering.
M: My favorite aspect. As close to perfection as one could experience. Very silky smooth. Moderate carbonation. Full bodied. Very viscous.
O: This is definitely one of my favorite beers. It slightly hedged out the KBS, primarily because of the MF. It was silky to the point it gained a 5.0 MF - perfection. This beer is defiantly worth hassle. 867 charactersmacher0, Jun 16, 2013

4.42/5  rDev -3.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5On tap at a local fundraiser, the stout was a deep black color with a small mocha head. The aroma was quite boozy with notes of dark fruit and burnt malts in the aroma. On the initial taste one first notices the booze. After this, one notices a chalky texture filled with dark chocolate, cherry and chewy malts. The coffee seems fairly masked in the overall scope of the beer. In the aftertaste, the warming of the alcohol comes to the front. In addition, the burnt malts and chocolate continue to make an impression. While I enjoyed this one, I did not find myself as impressed as some people. Still, this is a way above average stout. 636 charactersJohnnyHopps, Jun 16, 2013

A- Thin lacing, retention is poor. Lacing goes away after one minute. Predictable black BCBS. 
S- Coffee forward, bourbon backbone with dark fruit/molasses/chocolate/malt. 
T- This is slowly becoming my favorite variant. I am a huge BCBS fan, and the coffee on these bombers work so well. I get coffee&gt;bourbon&gt;chocolate&gt;malted molasses
M- Pretty thin. Just on the thin side of my liking. This is pretty easy to move around in your mouth (that's what she said) compared with Zhukov's girth. 
O- Love this variant. I will keep coming back to this coffee stout. 694 charactersgueuzedreg, Jun 11, 2013

The pour was midnight black, thick like used oil and velevetty also. A small wispy head forms and leaves gentile lacing around the sniffer.
The thing I liked most in the aroma is that the coffee aroma smells like roasted beans as opposed to black coffee. Rich bourbon notes and sutle vanilla comes through along with deep roasted malts.
The taste coats my tongue with warming alcohol and slowly opens to reveal rich roasted coffee beans vanilla creames and intense roasted malts.
It drinks thick and velvetty smooth with plenty of warming alcohol. Sweet by dry and a tad bitter.
Took me all day to drink it but I did. 797 charactersmicromaniac129, Jun 11, 2013

Smell - What an amazing aroma. Such a thick smell of malts mixed with bourbon and chocolate first hit the nose but then the coffee takes over and what a smell it is. The coffee is so present and powerful you would think you were smelling a cup of coffee instead of beer.
Taste - Unbelievable usage of coffee in a stout. By far the best example I have ever seen of it. The malt bill is extremely complex and the bourbon and chocolate notes play well as underlying flavors but the coffee steals the show again as it mixes with every flavor seamlessly and creates a perfect blend of coffee, bourbon, chocolate and malts
Mouthfeel - This is one of the thickest stouts I have ever had. It is chew-able in its thickness and is magnificent to drink
Overall - This is easily one of the best stout I have ever had. The integration of the coffee mixed with the bourbon and chocolate on top of the outstanding mouthfeel, creates one of the greatest stout drinking experience I have ever had. If you get a chance to have this, don't hesitate 1,110 charactersWiscoBrewsco, Jun 09, 2013

Oh wow. Coffee like no other. Intelligentsia's Imortales beans are INTENSE! Not just any coffee, you can tell this is premium beans with its distinct aroma and flavor. 2013's BCBS is hot to begin with, and everything blends perfectly. Caramel colored head that dissipates rather quickly, just the right amount of carbonation to open your tastebuds. Compared to 2012, this blows it out of the water. It might blow every other BCBS this year out of the way. At the tasting, the beers included BCBS Barleywine, BCBS 2013, BCBS Coffee, BCBS Templeton Rye, BCBS Backyard Rye & BCBS Proprietor's. I saved a small and equal portions of each for a grand cru.. and this still came out prevalent. I don't think I even want coffee anymore, I just want this. The perfect coffee stout to me so far. 841 characters4amepiphany, Jun 05, 2013

Pours jet black with a small ring of dark brown bubbles. Smells like a chocolate covered roasted marshmellow, with a slight alcohol presence. Taste starts off with some faded coffee and tons of chocolate and ends with a nice warming bit of bourbon barrel. Carbonation is soft and mouthfeel is on the thicker side. I have had this beer fresh and it was probably a 4.5 overall but with a few years on it an amazingly complex beer has devolped, glad I held onto this one. 480 charactersjoefuzz, May 27, 2013

S-poured from bomber bottles
A-Very dark, tan head, lacing
S-As it warms it goes from slight bitter coffee to a full, nice, fresh coffee smell
T-Base stout is there and creamy, but fresh coffee taste dominates once it warms up. Very good. Not bitter, not sweet, just all the qualities of a fresh cup of quality coffee. Very good and may be the best coffee I've had in terms of balance.
M-not as creamy as some other Goosse stout variations, but no complaints. Just about zero carbonation in mine.
O-Excellent coffee stout, top notch, seek it out! 572 charactersSHerninko, May 17, 2013

Much brighter aroma than 2014 but not quite as aromatic as 2013. Pitch black pour with dark brown head. Nice low level of carbonation. Mouthfeel is thicker than medium but not quite as heavy as I want. Taste is like a chocolate fudge brownie laced with coffee and bourbon. It's absolutely fantastic. Mild acidity from the coffee doesn't overwhelm like last year which leads to an incredibly pleasant and balanced drinking experience. This is a great rebound from last year and every bit worth the hype. Super smooth. This needs no age. Drink it now. I'm gonna go pop another. 716 charactersmyersk27, May 17, 2013

Had this batch a few times and I think it's hitting great right now - coffee is still very prominent but not overtly dominant. Aroma of rich coffee, heavy roast and ash, rich dark chocolate, some vanilla, and some of that bourbon caramel heat. Incredibly decadent - rich chocolates - milk-mocha, dark - vanilla, huge coffee carries through as well as some caramel and a bit of whiskey. Full bodied - viscous, appropriate carbonation, very smooth. 
Excellent beer - far and away the best coffee beer I've had. Very aggressively coffee out-of the gate, but with a couple months has blended well. 600 characterstimc100, May 12, 2013

It's aroma is the perfect blend of black coffee and a good bourbon. Very thick, really sweet to the taste. Bourbon dominates the coffee in flavor but there's still enough there to make it the perfect combination. 321 charactersClaytonbrewsby, May 09, 2013

A- Pours a 1 1/2 fingers worth of mocha brown head, typical looking Bourbon County Stout. Pitch black color, motor oil, head dissipated to a very thin layer around the glass. Not much lacing. 
S- Coffee just hits your nostrils up front. Wow, just amazing. If its possible to get past the coffee aroma, hints of bourbon come in slowly, vanilla, slight chocolate, nice buttery bourbon on the backend.
T- The taste is amazing. I wasn't sure the aroma could be topped, but it did. Coffee upfront, the bourbon is more present in the taste. Smooth buttery vanilla notes, dark malts, slight bitterness, but the bourbon really brings it home on the finish. Nice sweetness but not too overpowering. 
M- Big mouthfeel, smooth drinking, abv is very well hidden. No burn at all as it goes down, very smooth. Coats the palate, slight stickiness. 
O- Of the three versions that i've been lucky enough to have this year (Barley wine, Regular, Coffee) I would have to say the Coffee is the winner. Just an amazing satisfying beer. Perfect for this very cold MN winter weather. 1,125 charactersChriscrundwell12, May 07, 2013

A - oily black, completely opaque, small ring of khaki foam.

T - incredible stout. Coffee and smooth bourbon lead, then dark and milk chocolate notes. Not incredibly complex, but awesome nonetheless.

Big thanks to Masterski for giving me my first taste of the Bourbon County line.
Poured from a 650ml. bottle, bottled 03/26/10.
Appearance: Very thick and dark black/brown body. 2 finger head that disappears pretty quickly but probably normal due to ABV.
Smell: Some of the best bourbon notes i've smelled in a beer. Wafts of vanilla atop bourbon, light on the oak, deep rich robust espresso, images of coffee beans. Unending.
Taste: A seamless intertwining of strong coffee, woody bourbon, alcoholic vanilla, and oak. After a few sips though, i'm left slightly wanting.
Mouthfeel: Very low carbonation, slick feel, remarkably smooth.
Overall: I understand the hype on this one. While i was expecting a bit more expansive flavor, this still is very good for me. Send more the other variants Alex ;) 824 characterspapat444, Apr 15, 2013

Vintage 2012, poured into a snifter. Pours almost black, with a very thin dark mocha head. Thin layer dissipates rather quickly, leaving absolutely nothing behind. There is no "lacing" but the legs on this babe are incredible, staining the glass a caramel brown color.
Very sweet aromas are most obvious. Behind those I find typical BC smells of vanilla and caramel. Coffee plays a huge role as well, obviously. 
Taste is infused with flavors of vanilla, roasted malt, light chocolate, and a decent dose of Intelligentsia coffee. It's delicious, to be sure. Plenty of bourbon as well, perhaps more so than BCBS, odd given slightly less ABV.
Feel is not quite as smooth, perhaps due to the coffee. I do get a bit of coffee texture/acidity on the end. It's excellent nonetheless. The lack of lacing/presence of "legs" renders this, much like the base variety, similar to a wine. It drinks slow, but well (I took the whole 22oz. down myself). Overall tough choice for me which I like better. Coffee and regular are the only two I've had. BCBCS is really sticky and sweet, with tons of sugar. 
Very very good. Glad I am finally trying this. I have not had it fresh, so I am not sure where the coffee character should be, but if I believe the critics, fresher is better. I'd say coffee was less prominent than I anticipated. Overall, excellent beer. Cheers. 1,589 charactersrodlavers, Apr 10, 2013

Jet black, ring of tan head, no lace and fairly thick bodied. Smell is a mix of roast and fresh coffee beans, bourbon, vanilla, oak and chocolate, big fudge cake notes as well, milky chocolate mixed with bakers, just outstanding. Taste is like the nose great mix of bourbon, coffee and roast, chocolate, fudge, vanilla, bitter coffee finish, oak in aftertaste with chocolate and coffee. Lightly carbonated, full chewy body, big thick mouth coating feel. Absolutely incredible stuff here, such a delight to drink, takes BA coffee stouts to a whole new level, very impressive stuff here. 622 characterspeensteen, Apr 08, 2013

A- Pours an inky black, thick and viscous. A finger and a half of dark tan head that slowly recedes to a thin covering and collar leaving some decent lacing.
S- The nose is absolutely incredible! Remarkably rich coffee is in the forefront. Sweet toffee, caramel, and chocolate notes follow behind. Equally prominent is rich vanilla and bourbon. More subtle are the dark fruit and vinous aromas.
T- The flavor does not disappoint! The first thing I notice is this is much roastier than the sweet, rich aroma let on. Dark roast coffee provides a decidedly bitter note, and this bitterness is accentuated by a bitter baker's chocolate and dry cocoa flavor. Despite all the roast and bitterness there are still plenty of rich, sweet notes in this. The vanilla and toffee are the major contributions to this, but there are also sweet chocolate and caramel notes, and minimal hints of fig and date. Some charred oak comes through, and a mild hint of boozy bourbon.
M- Quite thick and viscous. A bit vinous and quite drying. Just enough carbonation, and a bit of warming booze.
O- Just a world class BBA imperial stout, and the coffee brings it to another level! One of the best variants of one of the best BBA stouts in the world! 1,262 charactersSadMachine, Apr 07, 2013

Appearance: Deep dark brown pouring out with richness leaving only a small tan cap even after an aggressive pour. The beer hangs on the glass with legs like fine Cabernet.
Smell: As expected, bourbon first with mostly oaky vanilla in the nose then the coffee and malty chocolate coming through underneath.
Taste: Surprisingly the first flavors are not at all coffee forward to me, what announces itself first is the incredible oaky vanilla from the barrel, then the coffee, then the chocolate. All three flavors working together in excellent balance. 
Mouthfeel: This finish on this beer is one attribute that sets it apart both from regular BCBS and other barrel aged stouts. It is exceptionally clean no coating or cloying aspects whatsoever. This is very pleasing given how creamy this beer taste on the palate.
Overall: My favorite Goose Island Beer to date, a truly excellent example of a bourbon barrel coffee stout. 999 charactersBobZ, Apr 07, 2013

2012 Vintage. 14.3% ABV .Bottled 11-12-12
Review #450 and a birthday present to myself.
A- Pours like you expect from bourbon county. Black as they come. Intense alcohol legs. A smal brown head, very little retention. An intense looking beer.
S- A big bourbon leaks out of this beer. A massive sour mash note and a nice charred oak. A lot of roasted malts and a touch of caramel sweetness. Some vanilla, a touch of coffee bitterness and dryness. Sweet and syrupy liquid of the gods.
T- A big bitterness at first. A coffee bitterness and a roasted malt dryness to start things off. It turns very sweet and thick. A smooth roasted malt profile with a dry and semi smokeyness to it, a slight char from the barrel. A touch of vanilla and a bit of caramel. The bourbon is most present on the back end of this beer. A big grainy sour mash flavor with a touch of dark fruits as well. The coffee in this beer may have faded at tad over 5 months but is still present and compliments the beer very well. 14.3%, where?
M- Very much on the sweet side. A thick and syrupy concoction. Very warming on the way down. Bitter coffee aftertaste.
O- All in all, im very glad I saved this one several months to enjoy on my birthday. But having had it, I don't think my willpower will be the same next year. Having just had an extremely comparable beer, KBS, the other day, I can attest to this beers superiority all though they are both world class. This is the best in the business. 1,496 charactersTwelveOunces, Apr 07, 2013

Pours oil black with a quarter finger capuccino head that leaves only a few cursory fleks of lace. 
Smells very similar to it's non-coffee cousin. Sweet, inviting bourbon, vanilla and some coffee. 
Taste bursts with that sweet oaky, vanilla, bourbon with roasty chocolate malts and a nice strong coffee that creeps in towards the finish. The booze is apparent but not near what expected for 14%+. Smooth and delicious. 
Oily, medium-ish body with light carbonation. Thinner than expected. Long, sweet bourboned coffee finish. 
The coffee was a bit more subtle than I expected but this is still a very tasty beer. Definately glad to try it and hopefully I'll be able to get more in the future. 793 charactersThickNStout, Apr 07, 2013

A: Fizzing pour yields an obsidian black body with a geyser turbulating the middle of the surface. There's an acceptable ring of dark mocha colored head, and legs leave a brown stain on the glass.
N: Loads of vanilla and caramel. Bourbon and wood are pronounced. Chocolate cake with a touch of soy sauce. There's a touch of espresso. Alcohol soaked raisins.
T: Raisins, vanilla, chocolate, and a coffee acidity. Some roast, but this is mostly sweet with a little spice like that of rye whiskey. Some salt.
M: Coating and yet some wateriness at the end. Lots of alcohol.
O: I expected more coffee out of this vintage. This also has a quality I don't recall from the 2010 vintage, and as such, it's good, but it's not the best of the lineup. Still worthy. 804 charactersSarlacc83, Apr 06, 2013

Pitch black with some brown bubbles across the top that swirl easily when agitated.
The nose is incomparable. The coffee and dark chocolate notes on the nose really get you excited to taste this beer. It's a deep dark roast scent.
The flavor is huge. The only reason I gave it a 4.75 instead of 5 on flavor is just because it packs so much flavor it's like a palate assault. It's definitely a sipper. It's like the best cup of espresso that you've had. The dark/baker's chocolate notes are big and enjoyable. There is some almost fruitiness to this roast as well. The mouthfeel is slick and rich, which matches the power of this beer.
I know this variant seems to be more limited, but it is worth seeking out. Try drinking it earlier in the day as this late night version had me wired with the huge coffee presence. Great beer indeed. 927 charactersPHBoiler, Apr 04, 2013

eyes...
dark black depth, dark cocoa head is smallish and fades quickly, there is a visible film on the sides of the glass, like year old cola it just slurs down the sides, this looks mean...
nose...
booza-palooza, like whiskey with coffee notes, some prunes, damn dark prunes, a touch of vanilla note in the back, definite wood tones in there as well, blindfolded I might think this was whiskey... woah boy this sucker packs a punch to the nose. letting this breathe for a few minutes i really get more of the roasty toasty coffee smell, it almost smells like candied coffee if that makes any sense...
taste etc...
thick and heavy as you might expect, boozy of course, the coffee kind of lends a chocolate-sweet note to it, at first it is almost too sugary/syrupy but mellows out a touch (and I do mean a touch), every sip lasts a long time, the after taste has many different levels, at first you get the oily thick slick feel, then sweetness, some booze tone, then it melts into coffee notes and some lingering bitterness all the while... tasty! definite sipper... 
verdict ?
this is smooth for the abv... but yet you sense the ABV the whole time... this is so big but yet so refined, a pure myriad of big flavors all in balance. get it when you can. 1,372 charactersEgo, Mar 31, 2013

4.64/5  rDev +1.3%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Black pour, dark dark brown on the edges. I can't even see through this beer when holding it up to the light. There is a thick, tan head that lingers.
The smell presents a strong bourbon smell mixed with vanilla and molasses. I am getting some espresso/coffee aromas, but it is not as pronounced as I would have expected. I think it may be because they are mixing into the bourbon and vanilla and producing an overall smell that I would describe as decadent, rich, and chocolate-like.
Starts with a big hit of fantastic, boozy bourbon and quickly transitions into a dark malty flavor with vanilla, caramel, and dark chocolate (assuming the coffee added to the bitterness factor here). I get a ever so slight fruit flavor for a fleeting moment. Finishes bourbon and roasted coffee with faded but lingering vanilla. The taste of coffee sticks around well after the sweetness has completely faded resulting in enhancement of the still biting alcohol, possibly the only unpleasing portion of the taste for me.
The mouthfeel is thick and oily. Very inviting and enjoyable. Also a bit more carbonation than I prefer, but only by a little.
Overall, this is a fantastic brew. This one could have probably aged a bit longer to suit my personal tastes, but without a doubt is impressive at any age. I think in it's current state, the coffee tends to move the alcohol flavor too forward for me. That being said, I don't think I'd pass up a chance to drink this again. 1,460 charactersPecan, Mar 27, 2013

T: Follows the nose basically to a tee, lots of coffee, felt like I was drinking an expresso. Good amount of bourbon at the end with hints of vanilla and nice roasted malts.

4.66/5  rDev +1.7%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Thanks to Ataraxia for this one, saving me the trouble of ever having to scour the ends of southeast Michigan to get my greasy paws on one. I love BCS and I love coffee so it stands to reason that I will bust my nut over this stuff, right? 2012 La Tortuga coffee edition. The pour is an incredibly deep shade of brown that it could easily be mistaken for completely black. The perfectly tan and grey tinted head is slow to form and bubbles up seconds after I'm finished pouring. A very still and menacing looking beer.
Wow, BCBCS has one of the deepest coffee aromas I've ever smelled. What exactly do I mean by "deep"? It's hard to explain, but I'll try - it's so dense, dark, roasted, grainy, raw, and pure with oily, thick, and robust coffee beans that it will immediately send any coffee-lover into an orgasmic coma. The bourbon is light on the nose at first, but comes out much more as the beer starts to warm up. The oak barrel flavors are much heavier than the bourbon itself and work very nicely with the coffee. Light vanilla and roasted cocoa powder outlines the edges of the aroma profile. So smooth, complex, deep, robust, and elegant, all at once. I think I need a cigarette.
The first thing I notice as I take a sip is that the mouth feel is nearly impeccable. So creamy, smooth, and silky on the palate - like a dream in liquid form. Big coffee and bourbon flavors up front - it's nice to see the bourbon come out strong in the flavor profile. After all, this IS bourbon county, right? One of the things I love about the original BCS and something that's proving to carry over to the coffee variant, too, is that the bourbon is so commanding and powerful, yet remains so smooth, mellow, and warming, without ever being too abrasive or hot. Goose Island has perfected the art of bourbon barrel aging a stout, I am completely convinced of that.
The amazing flavor continues to work all corners of my mouth. Smooth and deeply roasted, bitter coffee beans just run absolutely rampant; oily, thick, and borderline burnt. At first, coffee and bourbon comprise a majority of the profile, but the barrel characteristics really start to pop as the beer gets warmer. Heavy oak and wood, vanilla, light coconut, and a deep and super-bittersweet cocoa. Though it's warm and certainly boozy, the sweetness is perfectly balancing and very nice. So much so that it's wrong to call this beer "too boozy" or "too sweet", because it's neither. More and more, I'm starting to pick up some light spices, too. Maybe even light chilies on the tail end? Can't decide if it's actual chilies or just a light burn from such a heavy roasted blend of malt and coffee beans.
Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout is simply incredible. A coffee-stout lover's wet dream in a bottle. Just a maniacal explosion of coffee beans; roasty, bitter, creamy, and sweet all at once. Crazy oak, bourbon, vanilla, and cocoa tones with a nearly perfect balance. Sweet and warming with such an amazing delicacy. Insanely drinkable for such a high ABV. I battled over and over in my mind if I liked this better than the original BCS (especially the '08 vintage) and it took me a while to decide, but I believe this is top dog. Nevertheless, if its got Bourbon County on the label, you really can't go wrong. 3,276 characterstectactoe, Mar 24, 2013
4.85/5  rDev +5.9%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout (2012 release) opens to an amazingly rich and complex nose, the bourbon barrel aging and coffee notes immediately strong, and almost viscous in their presence. The oaky, vanilla, bourbon-laced notes from the former blend perfectly with a selection of dark fruit esters, including fig, date, prune, raisin, and plum, creating a Port wine feel that mixes nicely with the bourbon. Other sugars include deep runnels of molasses and brown sugar, as well as coffee cream, caramel, and toffee. These dark sugars nicely complement the coffees, which add fresh-ground dark roast notes, like those that issue from a bag of oily Columbian beans. There’s also a thick slice of toasted heavy brown bread in here, as well as a delicious series of dark and milk chocolate candies, and undercurrents of ash and tobacco. In short, this is an amazing series of aromas, and its difficult to imagine any more complex and potent notes in a beer.
On the tongue, the beer opens with a massive shot of fresh-ground oily espresso beans, which mix quickly with heavy whipping cream, vanilla, caramel, toffee, and brown sugar to create what might be the world’s tastiest cup of coffee. Add to this layers of ash and tobacco, and a thick swath of oak and vanilla, with surprisingly delicate, but very present, bourbon overtones. Then pile on fig, raisin, date, prune, and plum fruit esters, as well as milk and dark chocolates (creating a world-class Port overtone), and put all that on a piece of toasted brown bread, and you have what five-star restaurants try to imitate in their fanciest desserts. Even the massive 14.3% ABV is fairly well hidden by the hugeness and complexity of the flavors, for while it’s obvious that there is a good bit of alcohol in here, it blends so seamlessly with the bourbons, chocolates, and fruit esters that the tongue doesn’t care. The aftertaste is a delicious continuation of the main flavors, lingering on the tongue for a very long time. Mouthfeel is a weighty medium-heavy, and carbonation is medium-light to medium.
Overall, this is an amazing bottle of beer, and remarkable for not only how flavorful, nuanced, and potent it is, but for how utterly smooth and drinkable at the same time. Many high ABV beers end up being vodka or bourbon bombs, but this is so highly polished that it slides seamlessly down the throat, and is dangerously quaffable. One of the best bourbon-barrel-and-coffee beers on the market. 2,470 charactersjondeelee, Mar 24, 2013

4.96/5  rDev +8.3%look: 4.25 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Bottled 11/12/2012 (bomber): Pours motor oil black color with a foamy 1 finger brown head that faded fast, leaving a little foamy ring around the top of the beer and minimal lacing that slid down fast and rejoined the brew; as light hits the edges it looks reddish brown. 
Smell was really strong as I got my first whiff of sweet bourbon as the beer was going into the glass; smells great, and as I buried my nose in the glass the aroma was a combo of bourbon, molasses, syrup, caramel, toffee, vanilla, coffee beans (the Intelligentsia La Tortuga Beans listed on the label), roasted grains, oak or red wine barrel, a smoky merlot, brown sugar, light herbs and cocoa or dark chocolate notes. The coffee was surprisingly timid, and the vanilla and sweet yet mellow bourbon were just excellent to inhale. The barrel aging, molasses and vanilla sweetness really stand out and are really intense and enjoyable. The 14.3% ABV will fool you as this nose hides it completely and just dazzles with such sweetness that it blends the booze with the many sweet baking staples, and man does the vanilla level out the bourbon masterfully. 
Flavor takes off where the nose left it: heavenly. Something so strong and boozy should not be this easy to drink, but this brew pulls it off. Tastes of bourbon, molasses, syrup, caramel, toffee, vanilla, coffee, oak or red wine barrel notes, charcoal, merlot, brown sugar, roasted grains, licorice, dark rum, light herbs, cocoa powder, dark chocolate, cherry, plum or other dark fruit, butterscotch and more light booze. Again, the coffee was so minor that I wonder if the barrel aging soaked the coffee added with booze since the vanilla and sweet bourbon seem to control the taste as well. I can’t tell if the bitterness is from the hops or coffee in the mash, but either way the bittering just adds an effect to the sweet boozy dominance of the bourbon, molasses and vanilla presence. While I wish it had more coffee as advertised, I contradict myself and feel that the way it is in fact perfect: this is very smooth and drinkable, and consider the intense flavor, complexity and ABV in play, then I can conclude that this taste probably couldn’t improve all that much. More hops might be nice, but are not necessary; more coffee would be cool, but that doesn’t mean that this version was not worthy of being dubbed a world class brew. 
Mouthfeel is thick and slick, like and oil spill, but still somehow easy to drink; the booze and heat are present, but not a distraction or negative aspect, and the body is very thick, chewy and viscous, like drinking blood or hot fudge that is starting to become less liquid and more fudge – I know, that’s a strange analogy, but it’s true. 
So thick, so sweet, so boozy, yet amazingly sooo drinkable…this beer let me down at first because there was basically no major coffee presence, but after I got over that point I realized that this is one of the best beers that I’ve ever had. A “Top 5 Beer” for me, which is making typing this difficult because the ABV is kicking in, but this review is worth writing to boast about this unbelievably complex and tasty beer that hides the ABV perfectly and goes down easier than it should. A very high recommendation, buy a bottle of this if you can. It will be worth every penny spent.
4/23/2015: On tap at The Lark in East Northport, NY, it's velvety smooth with the alcohol burn coming through and the coffee bitterness dominating the flavor; a mix of oaky notes, mild bourbon, vanilla, coffee beans, molasses and rich sweet malts coming together in a near perfect way. This beer flows down easier than it should and is much easier to drink than something so powerful usually is. Unbelievable drink-ability for a beer this dense, it's outstanding again. 3,791 charactersCHickman, Mar 24, 2013

Big thanks to an awesome BA, rutager for this one. Can't wait to share a brew in person with you, man!
*I am reviewing this as a 2 year old BA imperial coffee stout. It has aged, the coffee will have faded (as expected). I will not be docking the score for it.
A: Pours with a deep red hue. In the glass, however, it is pitch black. I am having trouble even getting the blood red notes that I did from regular BCBS. 1/4 finger of mocha brown coloured head. Dissipated very quickly.
S: A very sweet smell. Bourbon, vanilla, dark chocolate, astringent coffee. Awesome.
T: Like regular BCBS but with a slight twinge of astringent coffee. Big vanilla notes. Pretty sweet. Caramel. Dark chocolate. This beer is being consumed way to quickly for 14%. Very drinkable despite the high ABV.
O: This is a fantastic beer. Yes, the coffee has faded. But, it is still there and adds a little something. Having had this fresh on tap at Top Hops in NYC, it is a very different beer. The 2012 was hugely coffee forward, and the bourbon was even more present. It was abrasive, but in a great way. I do believe that is what the brewers intended for this beer. Having said that, the 2011, even with the faded coffee, is an awesome beer and super drinkable. I would drink this often, but for very different reasons than BCBS and fresh BCBCS. It's a different animal. Loved it. Thanks again, Brad! 1,419 charactersmontrealbcr89, Mar 22, 2013

this is a very nice stout but a little bit TOO sweet for me. it makes sense since i always take my coffee black with no sugar. a nice effort at least, but i've had way better coffee stouts leaning more towards my liking. 705 charactersfacundoCNB, Mar 17, 2013

Pours dark black with a dark brown head that fades quickly. 
Aromas of bourbon, fresh coffee, oak, and chocolate.
Taste is of fresh coffee, rich bourbon, with a dark chocolate finish. Pure euphoria.
Mouthfeel is rich and boozy. Moderate carbonation, highly drinkable, very clean and a refreshing finish.
I think this beer is at its perfect stage. Any longer and the coffee might fade, but it still crushes regular BCBS! 504 charactersmnphish, Mar 10, 2013

A: Deep black pour with a small tan head. Looks thick. 
S: Smells boozy. Oak, bourbon, chocolate, vanilla, coffee. Maybe even some coconut? Mostly smells like a cup of coffee with bourbon and that's not a bad thing. 
T: Wow, this is excellent. Starts with spicy, oaky bourbon notes. Dark roasty malts. Coffee and chocolate blended together with a nice bitter taste. Slight vanilla notes. A bit of alcohol heat. 
M: This is extremely drinkable. Super smooth, thick bodied with moderate carbonation. 
O: Quite possibly the best coffee stout I've had. My favorite BCBS variant so far, surpassing Vanilla and the legendary Rare. I'll have to try Cherry Rye and Bramble soon. 721 charactersstandardcherry, Mar 10, 2013

S: Smells thick with bourbon, coffee, toffee and chocolate.
T: More bourbon, slight notes of coffee there too, extremely smooth i'd imagine the alcohol to be more present, which was well hidden.
M: Thick rich and creamy.
O: A giant sipper, my personal preference liked the non coffee version better. This is a beer to savor, and savor I did. I loved it till the last drop. 494 charactersrobhbest, Mar 09, 2013

Wonderful coffee smell off the bat with only the slightest note of bourbon. Flavor was good coffee, slight hint of chocolate and vanilla. This was a good beer but anything more than a couple ounces and its just a chore to finish. There is a huge astringency from the alcohol that comes over your tongue in a wave after each sip. Its just too damn strong. If this was around 9% it would probably be amazing.

Served in a Port City snifter.
A: Vicious pour: Tar-like black liquid accompanied by a slight head that was only a couple of shades lighter than the liquid below it.
S: Lots of coconuty bourbon, strong, for sure, with the signature BCBS profile in spades. Didn't get much coffee on the nose, but the aroma was still next to heaven.
T: Okay, now I got some coffee buried beneath the awesomeness. Sure, the coconut bourbon was there, but the coffee added just the right contrast. Not too bitter, but just like "Wake N' Bake," there was sort of a buttercream flair that was to die for.
M: Picture perfect carbonation bill, minimal lacing, and a awesome, candy-coated booze that was reminiscent of the finest of fine desserts. Sweet, but still not cloying... well, actually, it was, but it was supposed to be!
O: Simply put, this is liquified tiramisu in a glass. I gave this a five simply because it's impossible to improve on perfection. 955 charactersChaney, Mar 06, 2013

A: Nothing out of the ordinary. Just what you'd expect, opaque, very tiny hints of dark red at the bottom of the glass. Poured with a dark brown head that disappeared in a matter of seconds. No lacing to speak of, a few tiny random bubbles floating around the top of the beer, you can see very faint traces of carbonation around the sides of the glass. None of that should come as a surprise when drinking a 14.3% abv barrel aged stout. Looks more like wine in the glass than beer, sticky alcohol legs run down the sides of the glass when the beer is swirled.
S: The aroma is phenomenal, so much going on. Oak, bourbon, chocolate, vanilla, anise, alcohol, a faint smokiness, and just a touch of coffee. I'm surprised by the lack of coffee in the nose, the beer smells pretty much just like regular BCBS (which is not a bad thing). Unlike most other coffee stouts the coffee is extremely subdued in the nose of this beer. I'm not knocking it, the beer smells incredible, just not exactly what I was expecting.
T: The taste pretty much follows what I get in the aroma. Tastes very similar to the regular BCBS. Take all the descriptions I gave of the smell and apply them to the taste. Pretty amazing. I'm just again a little surprised by the lack of coffee. The HUGE abv is masked so well that it's almost scary, the beer warms you up on the way down, but if I didn't know any better I'd just guess this was 9, or maybe 10 percent. The coffee shows up a little bit in the aftertaste, especially when I breathe out, but overall there's not much of a coffee flavor.
M: Pretty amazing. Feels like a big silky smooth California Cabernet. Definitely coats your mouth, but not in an overwhelming way. Carbonation is perfection, very light, but that's exactly how it should be, just enough carbonation up front to let you know it's beer, but it finishes just like a big red wine, or perhaps even port. Falls right on the heavy side of being medium bodied.
O: Overall this beer isn't what I was expecting, but not in a bad way. I thought there would be a lot more coffee going on, but instead it just tastes like a more complex version of the base beer, BCBS, which is absolutely awesome. This is a true sipping beer, what a decadent treat. I'm tackling this bomber alone and it will probably take me near two hours to drink all of it, but I'll savor every sip. Huge thanks again to my good buddy Nick (durb777) for sending this to me. Hopefully I'll get to try BCBS Cherry Rye one day, but for now I'm totally happy just having this, and knowing that I have a few bottles of plain BCBS in the cellar. I don't give a shit about Goose Island being owned by the "enemy" as long as they keep producing mind blowing beers like this. 2,812 charactersbifrost17, Mar 03, 2013

overall - my absolute favorite beer. as a lover of stouts, bourbon, and coffee - it doesn't get any better than this. Glad they put it in 12oz bottle this year.

S: It smelled like lots of toasted coconut and roasted coffee, with some rich dark chocolate and vanilla, and a little oak and almonds.
T: It tasted like huge toasted coconut and dark roasted coffee, with some rich dark chocolate and vanilla and oak. It had a clean and sweet aftertaste with a bit of alcohol warming.
M: It was thick and chewy with moderate carbonation. Great big body.
D: There wasn't as much coffee as expected, with coconut character from bourbon barrels dominating. But it still had an amazing scent and taste and body. The finish was really smooth, and the alcohol was decently hidden. So it was surprisingly easy to drink, but should be sipped. With not a ton of coffee character already, there isn't much to lose by aging. But it's not really necessary to sit on this brew, since it's already pretty amazing and drinkable now.

Aroma offers all the same characteristics of the original (bournon and its barrel, chocolate, a little roastiness) in addition to some coffee beans, which are there but far from being as aggressive or bold as I expected and hoped for. Flavor offered everything the original offered, though perhaps a touch lighter on the bourbon and its barrels, and just a touch of some subtle coffeee. Honestly, were this a blind taste test I do not know if I could have differentiated between this and the original. A great beer but I docked points because I was hoping for a hopped up coffee version of BCBS and I didn't find that here in all honesty. A full, creamy, velvety mouthfeel. Overall, this a great beer. BCBS is a great beer too. I'll take the original version over this as I liked that it has more bourbon and its barrel character than this, but also (and probably more importantly) when you put 'coffee' in the title I go in with certain expectations for the beer (big, bold coffee flavors) and personally felt that this did not deliver in that respect. Still, a fantastic, fantastic beer. 1,168 charactersdenver10, Mar 01, 2013

4.83/5  rDev +5.5%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75A- Pours like thick, used motor oil. Viscous with very little head as I pour. Small, chocolatey brown head forms about 1 cm thick. Head retains well, but tames down to a thin film. Lacing is pretty good.
S- Smells like the darkest cup of coffee you ever had, mixed with about 2 shots of bourbon. Spicy and oak flavors from the barrel, with big whiskey notes too. Coffee takes a slight back seat to the bourbon and barrel flavors. Highly complex scent.
T- Just like the scent, except somewhat smoother. Starts with big hits from both the bourbon, barrel, and coffee flavors. Spicy oak flavor melds straight into classic American bourbon flavor. Backbone of dark roasty malts provide a good base for the coffee to take over after the bourbon. Coffee is strong and bitter, and moves the beer right to the end of the drink with a bite.
M- Thick and creamy, despite having a high level of carbonation for an impy stout. Heavy in flavor, the weight of the beer on the palate supports it well. Very little heat from the alcohol content until a bite at the very end. Hardly any burn going down at all.
Overall, a terrific barrel-aged coffee stout. I didn't know how the coffee and bourbon would interact, but neither overpowers, and they work together seamlessly. 1,259 charactersboilermakerbrew, Mar 01, 2013

A: Almost-black body with a dark tan 1.5 finger fizzy head, dissipates with minimal lacing into a fine rim around. 
S: Wonderful bitter coffee aroma with toffee, dark chocolate, vanilla, a hint of bourbon. Wonderful nose.
T: Follows the nose well. The coffee notes are prominent, the barrel aging is evident throughout the whole body, borders on overwhelming but brings it together quite nicely. Vanilla, brandy, a touch of sweetness, and only a little heat lingers on the aftertaste. 
M: Dangerously drinkable. Smooth with at least a moderate level of carbonation, not as chewy as BCBS, a nice lingering aftertaste has a drying effect.
O: The finest coffee stout I've ever tried. It is what it tries to be: A barrel-aged RIS with coffee. Perfectly done. 802 charactersMCain04, Feb 27, 2013

A: Pours a deep silky black with only a tiny amount of dark tan head. The foam settles almost immediately, and there is no lacing left on the glass as it drinks. This beer has serious legs though, as the viscosity of this beer makes it stick to the glass.
S: The nose is malt, coffee, raisins, caramel, mild vanilla, and boozy bourbon heat. Smells good, but its a touch too sweet.
T: Right up front, I'm met with milk chocolate and raisins. The coffee notes in the beer are strong, and take over in the middle. The palate is coated, and as the beer transitions to the finish, I get vanilla and booze. Once again, it's a bit sweet for my tastes.
M: Full bodied beer. It's thick, smooth, velvety, and coats the palate. It lingers for quite some time, and it finishes smooth. The alcohol is evident, but it's subdued by the coffee notes. 
O: This is really excellent beer. I have stated again and again that I like stouts with more of a burnt/roasty flavor to stouts that are sweet and stone fruit forward. The coffee in this beer cuts down on the raisin flavors of regular bourbon county, but it's still just too sweet for me to absolutely love this beer. But, with that said, I'd drink this again in a heartbeat. 1,232 characterstrxxpaxxs, Feb 19, 2013

Being really picky on coffee blends, I didn't know how I'd rate this years batch of BCBCS. I wasn't a fan of last years at all as it was way too bitter and had more of a coffee ground taste. When I went searching for this years variants, I put coffee as least priority to find. This years batch consisted of a blend called "Los Immortales", and of course was provided by Intelligentsia.I received two bottles of coffee as my allotment at one store, and had it fresh.
A- Poured pitch black with a chocolate colored head that quickly receded. The edges of my glass allow some light to pass through the beer, which is dark brown in color. The beer is thick and clings to the side of my glass when I give it a swirl.
S- Sweet milk chocolate mixed with a smooth, mellow roast of coffee. Can definitely smell the alcohol, and is very intimidating with the booze. Extremely sweet smelling, and had hints of burnt sugar and roasted malts.
T- Initial chocolate and sugar rush, with lots of chocolate and an extremely smooth blend of coffee. A little bit of leather that ends with a little bite from the coffee. As stated, this blend of coffee is extremely tame and enjoyable for any coffee drinker. Can taste some of the heat as well but it is hidden very well with the complexity of the beer.
M- Low carbonation, high viscosity, warm feeling going down. Typical lovely BA'd stout.
O- I am extremely surprised how much I enjoy this beer. The coffee is extremely fantastic, but doesn't hold well. This is my second bottle of this years batch, and honestly I can already taste a difference from the last bottle I drank a few weeks ago. Drink it now! After my first bottle I had to find more, and was lucky to get a couple more 4pks. Lastly, for those who don't like coffee beers, you may not enjoy this beer but I feel like you would be able to appreciate a taste and how complex this beer is without being overburdened by the coffee like prior years. 1,959 charactersEfay, Feb 17, 2013

A: Pours an opaque jet black in color with a viscosity like motor oil, very light amounts of visible carbonation, and some very dark brown highlights when held up to the light. The beer has a finger tall slightly fizzy mocha head that quickly reduces to a medium sized patch of very thin film and a thin ring at the edges of the glass. Light to moderate amounts of lacing are observed.
S: Strong aromas of bourbon and vanilla with some more moderate aromas of darkly roasted coffee bean and light aromas of roasted dark malts. Just a touch of chocolate and alcohol.
T: Light to moderate amounts of roasted dark malts with moderate to strong flavors of coffee and some fairly strong notes of bourbon + vanilla from the barrel-aging. Some very subtle notes of milk chocolate are also present. As the beer warms up, there are stronger amounts of coffee and some light notes of oak. Light amounts of bitterness which fade fairly quickly.
M: Full bodied with light amounts of carbonation. Slick with some light amounts of alcohol warming in the finish.
O: This beer is extremely enjoyable but should definitely be thought of as a big beer - intense flavors, aromas, and high ABV make this a beer best enjoyed by slowly sipping throughout the evening. The coffee addition really makes this beer great, even better than BCBS - which is quite an accomplishment. 1,378 charactersdbrauneis, Feb 17, 2013

Appearance- Pours jet black motor oil, tan head, absolutely no light getting through
Aroma- The bourbon aroma is slightly spicy. Not as much coffee as I expected, but it’s there for sure, heavily roasted. Definitive vanilla/oak character on the nose, also some subtle maleness
Mouthfeel- Very full bodied and thick, oily, drying and coating at the same time, higher co2 than expected, kind of acidic
Taste- Tastes a lot better than it smells, pretty complex. It’s very sharp in flavor, the bitterness of the dark malts compounds with the bitterness of the coffee. The coffee flavor is not too strong, was expecting more. Bourbon flavor is on the finish, although the oaky vanilla notes are not too pronounced
Residual- Black irish coffee and caramel, slight stickiness 
Overall- Of the three BCBS beers that I’ve had (BCBS, Cherry Rye, Coffee), this is definitely my least favorite. It’s a little too sharp for my tastes- some might find that appealing though. It’s a complex sipping beer that is worth meditating on, but odds are I would not seek this out again. Glad I got to try it though, and it definitely gets better as it warms 1,223 charactersAnker13, Feb 16, 2013
4.64/5  rDev +1.3%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Reviewed on 02/11/2013. Bottled on 11/12/2012. 22oz bottle poured into a snifter.
Pours a solid black with a surprising half finger of light tan foam that sticks around for a bit. It eventually dwindles down to a thin, spotty cap and ring around the glass. Slight, wispy lacing is left on the glass.
The nose is full of bourbon and vanilla. They aren't overwhelming but are fairly strong. Coffee is here but it pairs with some nice roasty notes as complimentary notes to the main bourbon and vanilla. Despite the strong bourbon notes the beer doesn't smell all that boozy.
The aroma was great but the taste is top notch. Huge coffee, vanilla and roasty notes work nicely with the bourbon and oak providing a very complex and balanced experience with each sip. Each characteristic is blended so well that they all flow nicely together. The taste is exceptional.
Low carbonation matched with a the thick body give the beer a huge mouthfeel. There is definitely a kick and burn from the alcohol but it doesn't hinder the enjoyment.
This beer is outstanding. The coffee notes only enhance the Bourbon County experience. It shines through and allows the bourbon, vanilla and roast to come across as it normally does. Well done. 1,227 charactersms11781, Feb 16, 2013

Aroma is beautiful vanilla, chocolate, licorice, some salty black bean sauce, and maybe a hint of earthy coffee. Was expecting a bit more coffee but it smells divine anyway. Mouthfeel is very thick and viscous. Sweet vanilla chocolate up front, with light earthy coffee tones. Bit of licorice. Extremely rich. Pretty sweet stuff, but very drinkable. Alcohol hidden better than the regular BCS I had from 2012, but still present. This is awesome. (4.41)
Now trying a 2013 bottle on 3/22/14. Same look as before. Lots more earthy spicy coffee on the aroma this year whoah, also light vanilla and oak notes, not a lot of bourbon as the beautiful coffee overpowers on the nose. Big rich earthy coffee, fades into roasty cocoa notes, then sweetens up with vanilla and chocolate with a touch of bourbon booze that lingers on the palate. Huge rich thick velvety mouthfeel with low plus carbonation. This one is much more coffee forward than I remember the 2012 and makes for a very nice change up from the regular version. Maybe the only complaint is that I get less barrel here, but still very Mmmm. This awesome coffee bomb upped the rating from me a good bit. (4.71)
2014 bottle poured with the wife on Black Friday. Still like before in terms of looks. Huge coffee aroma and flavor, but again low on the bourbon. Still just a killer effing coffee stout. Beautiful. (4.67)
Had the 2014 with a few months in the cellar on it now, and it has improved, with the sweet bourbon and chocolate giving more balance to the earthy spicy coffee (that still is powerful here). This is nearly perfect now with the coffee every so slightly mellowed down. (4.88).
Rating is highest score of all vintages. 1,775 charactersBMMillsy, Feb 12, 2013

A Black body topped off with a thin brown head. Nothing special
S Lots of roasted coffee, that was balanced with some bourbon.
T Pretty similer to the nose with a lot of coffee, roast and bourbon. The coffee was very smooth and meshed well with the bourbon. 
M Thick and coating. 
Overall this is a pretty good coffee stout, however there is nothing here that you can't get with any other well made coffee stout. The only thing that really stands out about it is how smooth the coffee is. Worth picking up if you see one though as its still pretty good. 660 charactersbeerandcycling88, Feb 11, 2013

Appearance: Black with a very thin light brown head dissipating almost immediately. Essentially no lacing. Looks like motor oil.
Smell: Coffee hits the nose first with strong bourbon and vanilla backing it up closely. Oak and caramel also come into play. Very intense aroma.
Taste: Impressive. Powerful bourbon presence up front (which is expected from a BCBS variant). Coffee comes into play along with vanilla, oak, and caramel. The coffee really helps back up the bourbon. Finishes quite sweet. Actually much sweeter than I was expecting, which holds the beer back a bit in my opinion. A little more balance and this would easily be a 4.75, maybe even a 5.
Mouthfeel: Thick and very smooth. Appropriately low carbonation. Coats the mouth going down, leaving a lingering bourbon flavor.
Overall: Truly an excellent beer, but ends up a bit unbalanced with the bourbon/vanilla onslaught and the overly sweet finish. Definitely more in-your-face than, say, a KBS, but could really use some balance. Still a truly excellent beer. 1,123 charactersemyers, Feb 11, 2013

2012 with La Tortuga
A: Pours a deep, dark brown color with a minimal dark tan head that quickly recedes. 
S: Massive coffee smell hits the nose immediately, a very welcoming scent in my favorite stouts. The coffee is not alone though, the bourbon comes thru as well with some roasted malts and some serious vanilla.
T: This beer lives up to the hype. It's a big, bold and flavorful offering with the bourbon coming through right off the bat, as expected and I'm glad it is so prominent. The roasted malts hit you in the middle, along with the alcohol and traces of vanilla and oak poking through. The finish is where the coffee hits the palate, what a delicious beer this is.
M: Big and bold, creamy and full bodied.
O: This beer is exactly as expected, it is excellent. Huge flavor and alcohol, yet so smooth and delicious that you could sip on it all night and not even realize you are drinking a massive 14% beer and you probably won't be able to feel your legs when you stand. This is by far my favorite GI BCS (haven't had my Rare yet, so for now it will remain), the addition of the coffee beans really does this beer well. 1,256 charactersmavbrew, Feb 10, 2013

Note: 2011 vintage
Consumed 2/8/13
Appearance: Black, black, black - about as black as a liquid can get - small, tan head - fades to nothing, but it's possible to drum up some carbonation - oily, thick, intimidating
Smell: As crazy as I had hoped - burnt, with loads of chocolate and coffee - BCBS is loaded with roasty coffee aromas to begin with, and the addition of real coffee takes things to the next level - dark coffee, coffee beans, rich espresso - dark chocolate, baker's chocolate, and cocoa - dark, burnt malts - molasses, caramel, and burnt sugar - vanilla, rich bourbon, and wood
Taste: Decadent and lovely - burnt and rich - rich, thick espresso and burnt coffee - dark chocolate, baker's chocolate - kind of like a mocha ice cream, but burnt, condensed, and sans cream - char, caramel, molasses - lots of bourbon, some wood, and vanilla - some bitterness, and some nice alcohol heat that is rapidly spreading to my extremities
Mouthfeel: Full body, viscous, minimal carbonation, with some heat at the finish
Overall: Lovely; I think this would sustain me in a blizzard
This is great. The coffee aroma and flavor is great. The only thing stopping me from rating this higher is Bourbon County Brand Vanilla Stout... This is awesome, but slightly less awesome. The bourbon notes are still quite strong. A lovely sipper, to say the least. 1,482 charactersangrybabboon, Feb 09, 2013

Appearance: Deep, dark almost black. Rich Browne and reds when held to light. Head is khaki and drops to a tiny collar almost instantly. No lacing or cap. Very still. Pours a little heavy.
Smell: Fudgey coffee. Chocolate cake, cocoa, fresh roasted coffee beans. Vanilla, oak, and bourbon. Syrupy sweet. Loaded with coffee and chocolate in all forms. Slightly earthy with some burnt backing. Oily slick espresso. Chocolate coveted espresso beans. Caramel and touches of brown sugar. Very sweet. Sharp bite of alcohol under it all. Some licorice. 
Taste: Screams of coffee. Fresh roasted beans. A touch of acidity. Chocolate covered espresso beans. Fudge and chocolate cake covered in bourbon and vanilla. Deeply roasted and slightly burnt. Caramelized sugars. Straight up vanilla beans and fresh-brewed coffee. Sharp bite of the particular coffee bean. Booze, brown sugar, and roasted sweetness. Coffee vanilla roasty bourbon. Toffee. 
Mouthfeel: Full body with minor carbonation. Slick and oily. Lingering hit of alcohol.
Overall: Coffee in the morning, coffee in the evening, coffee at suppertime. When coffee's in a beer, you can have coffee anytime.
Damn good, but not the most standout of the variants. Although, matching Vanilla and KH is almost impossible. Fresh is next. 1,297 charactersGoblinmunkey7, Feb 09, 2013

A: very dark brown to red coloring with a thin mocha head that leaves a thick lacing around the edge of the glass. The beer is totally opaque and pours thick like syrup or oil.
S: Well there is certainly lots of bourbon but it is quite chocolatey as well. Also quite present is deep smell of very dark coffee. It really is wonderful it smells like a dessert I would love to try better then some other stouts that try and emulate desserts. 
T: Yum so this follows the nose with lots of tasty and chocolatley bourbon to start then there is an espresso taste that is so dark it is almost hard to distinguish from the chocolate, but it is definitely there to add a lot of depth to the original BCBS flavor.
M: The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy while also being thick and extremely chewy toffee like for sure. It is almost like chocolate mocha bourbon syrup but not quite that thick but with enough flavor to be syrup. 
O: Wow so this is a great beer definitely an upgrade to the regular BSBS and i really like the addition of coffee taste as it blends quite well with the bourbon taste. The only thing that I will say is that I wish there was a little more balance between the coffee and bourbon but that is some serious nit picking as this is a truly phenomenal beer. 1,292 charactersPinknuggets, Feb 05, 2013

A: Midnight black, rich decadent pour. Aggressive khaki head that sticks around for quite a while and leaves nice vestiges around the edges of the glass. Beautiful looking beer and everything I want my imperial stouts to look like.
S: Booze, bourbon, coffee (not overwhelmingly so), vanilla. Intoxicating.
T: Ridiculously good. There's a lot going on here. Up front I get heavy malt, bourbon, vanilla, wood. After this comes some chocolate roast, rich molasses, some liquid caramel, brown sugar, candi sugar, brownie batter, and an amazing melange of dark fruits. The finish is primarily coffee, more rich malt, and some definite cognac in there too. These all work together really well....so delicious. My only knock is that I personally actually wish there was a little MORE coffee here throughout than there is. Still, it's a world class brew.
M: A sipper for sure. It's definitely a little hot...the alcohol is definitely noticeable and present. Very warming. Thick, rich, viscous. Very satisfying. 1/4 of a point docked for the hotness.
Overall, an amazing beer. So glad I finally go got to try it. Would definitely have again and seek out. Glad I got 2 bottles so I can see what some age does to the other one. Cheers! 1,242 charactersbcostner1, Feb 04, 2013

(My notes for both 2010 and original 2012 were accidentally deleted, btw).
New review for 2012:
A- Black with a small brown head. 
S- Chocolate, coffee, fudge, bourbon.
T- Bourbon, oak, alcohol, fudge, chocolate, coffee undertones. (My first 2012 featured a huge orange sherbert flavor btw, which was unique but good). 
M- Full bodied. Smooth.
O- This may be a bit better than the 2012 original BCBS. Completely ready to drink. Do not age. Definitely better than the original batch of BCBCS a couple of years ago that everyone went bonkers for. 662 charactersTK5150, Feb 04, 2013

S: Where to begin? Dark roast coffee, vanilla, bourbon, oak, all varieties of chocolate, caramel, cinnamon, anice, allspice, even clove and some other dessert spices, all rounded out with an espresso-like dryness.
T: At first, huge notes of mocha latte. The chocolate mixes so well with the coffee that you can substitute any favorite coffee drink flavor here and you'll likely find it. Then, there's a caramel/vanilla/bourbon mix of booze and sweet that really hits the spot, and the end is an unforgiving, black roast mix of espresso and black coffee, but somehow ends up tasting like cappuccino towards the end. Mind-boggling how beer can taste like this.
O: One of my favorite beers ever. 773 charactersKrakistophales, Feb 02, 2013

The scent was of coffee and cream with touches of vanilla and coconut. The coffee scent is strong with the feel of a high grade coffee, ain't no Gas station cup of joe.
One sip and I was taken to the very first time I had ever enjoyed coffee. Some one mixed it with Baileys and I was hooked. Notes of sweet Irish cream and roasted coffee accent some toffee and vanilla. 
Expectation and hype were fulfilled in a tremendous offering from Goose Island. 566 charactersKYGunner, Feb 01, 2013

S- big Bourbon presence, milk chocolate tones, slight coffee aroma .... woody undertones
T- sweet milk chocolate, bakers bitter chocolate, woody vanilla tones, coffee highlights but not dominant... bozzy Bourbon
M- full body stout, smooth and creamy ... warm from the Bourbon with a almost numbing on the tongue... for a beer with 14% abv the impression is very well masked ....
O- my first glass of goose bcbs brand ... does not disappoint, lives up to the hype ... and I want more! Seriously I want more 660 characterswarrenout330, Jan 31, 2013

There is maybe of fingers worth of tightly packed chocolate mousse colored foam which quickly dissipates to a thin ring around the edge of the liquid. 
S - the nose is very balanced. The Bourbon is bright with notes of warm gooey caramel followed by oily notes of roasty espresso beans. But wait there is more? The bourbon also brings along dusty notes of wood (sawdust?), dark semi-sweet chocolate and maybe just a touch of menthol. 
T - a lot of flavors on the palate at once. a blend of roasty, toasty and sweet all on the front end. the bourbon lends notes of caramel, oak, and hints of vanilla. Flavors grow more aggressive mid palate with lots of roasty coffee notes. the oily coffee notes grow even strong on the back end along with a touch of alcohol heat. the finish is long and full of sweet caramel. the alcohol heat completely passes the throat but lingers with a pleasant warmth in the chest. 
M - coffee with heavy cream and a high carbonation? yeah that's the best way to sum up the creamy full bodied and bubbly carbonation on this beer. 
O - Excellent. Well balanced in every way which is always impressive for a bourbon barrel aged beer. Something to savor indeed. 1,267 charactersTeleweizen2, Jan 29, 2013

Smell- terrific coffee with hints of dark fruits and a touch of booze.
Taste- a lot of coffee stouts taste like stale coffee but this is the freshest tasting coffee I have experienced. The classic BCBS barrel comes through at the end. Again like the nose there is a touch of booze.
Mouthfeel- the highlight of this beer for me. Silky smooth with perfect carb.
Overall- this beer totally lived up to the billing. Great coffee on top of an almost perfect base. Delicious. 560 charactersJfriz25, Jan 27, 2013

A: Pour is jet black with a fairly minimal, mocha colored head. Head quickly recedes but there is a very thin ring around the edge of the glass. No lacing, but noticeable alcohol legs with each glass swirl.
S: There is definitely that trademark Bourbon County aroma, but it is nicely complimented by the coffee beans. Chocolate (almost fudge-like), mocha, bourbon (obviously), and vanilla. 
T: I imagine that if you dunked a fudge brownie in bourbon, took a bite, then chased it with a nice cup of coffee, you could pretty closely approximate this beer's flavor profile. A really interesting and enjoyable experience. As the beer warms, much more of the bourbon and barrel characteristics make their presence felt. Great flavor on this one.
M: Love that classic Bourbon County mouthfeel. Thick with low carbonation, so it just coats your tongue with each sip. Bordering on syrupy, but fits with the overall complexity of the beer.
O: My first of the Bourbon County variants and it did not disappoint. The coffee adds a new interesting element to a base beer that already has a ton going on. Very enjoyable drinking experience. 1,200 charactersdbc5, Jan 27, 2013

Great nose, lots of Bourbon, a lot like regular bcbs just with a light scent of coffee. Tastes litterally identical to bcbs, but with a wee bit of coffee up front, and a bit of a burnt coffee aftertaste, but in a good way. Lots of bourbony goodness, but never overpowering, and a great stouty base. Moutfeel is almost perfect, but if they could take the mouthfeel from Baudenia, and replace it with this, it would be perfect. Overall, great beer, and the third installment of the Bourbon County line that I have had the priviledge of tasting. Only complaint- could use some more coffee, otherwise, it just kinda tastes like the original... which is fine. 728 charactersGoosey, Jan 24, 2013

Beer pours pitch black with half a finger of creamy dark brown head that quickly dissipates. Viscous in the glass, with plenty of alcohol legs with a light swirl. 
Big coffee notes, fairly dark roast, some light charred wood, bitter chocolate and roasted malt, vanilla, toffee. 
Huge coffee flavors on the first sip, like drink a cool shot of espresso, with dark roasted and dried fruit flavors. Followed up with bitter chocolate and dark roasted malt, toffee, graham cracker, vanilla, charred wood. Medium finish with lingering coffee flavors.
Full body, thick and sticky, with a good amount of tingly carbonation that keeps the beer from being cloying. The beer is definitely a different animal when fresh compared to other times I've tried it, from 8-24 months old. 862 charactersnataku00, Jan 21, 2013

L: Very thick, jet black. Dark tan, carbonated head that dissipates.

A really fantastic beer. However, i wasn't that impressed with the coffee, it was very subtle throughout. Not sure how much it brings to the table when BCBS is so much easier to find and cheaper. 689 charactersbum732, Jan 18, 2013

Silky smooth with a velvety dark cocoa afterglow. Splendid alcohol heat providing good comfort. GI at it's finest.
Keeping it simple folks, really the buck stops here...best in show! IMO the best coffee stout in North America. GI, hands down, has set the benchmark for greatness. Priveleged to obtain on-tap. 503 charactersjoeseppy, Jan 18, 2013

A: Pours thick and dark. Extremely dark brown with a hint of deep crimson emerging with backlighting (as the beer is poured, not in the glass...no light comes through with backlighting the glass). Essentially no head. Typical BCS stuff.
S: Wonderfully sweet boozy bourbon mixes with medium roast coffee beans. Very pleasant balance of about 60:40::bourbon:coffee. Phenomenal.
T: Sweet bourbon, vanilla, and wood hit first. Then medium roast coffee, cream, and caramel takes over. The slowly warming and strengthening alcohol note kicks in for the finish. What amazes me most is how restrained the alcohol note is at 14.3%. Dark dried fruit emerges with warming.
M: Heavy body, but very smooth and slightly oily feel. A bit of sticky sweetness. The alcohol burn is certainly present, but quite mild compared to the ABV. Nice lingering finish on the palate.
D: A deceptively easy drinker. 14.3% will catch up with you. A simply phenomenal brew, but definitely what I'd expect from a BCS variant. Seek it out if you can!

A: Pours an extremely dark black-brown with 1/4 inch dark mocha head that quickly recedes.  Looks thick and viscous.  No light comes through with backlighting.  (4.5)
S: Smooth dark chocolate, sweet bourbon, and medium roast coffee.  Hint of cream.  Not quite as potent with aging. (4.5)
T: The sweet dark chocolate hits first, quickly followed by the sweet bourbon.  A couple seconds later, the medium roast coffee hits.  Hint of cream here too.  Again, lost a half step with aging.  (4.5)
M: Heavy body, but super smooth.  Viscous and darkly sweet.  Mild coffee bitterness.  Decent lingering and maturing on the palate. (4.25)
D: Still a strong brew, but aging is starting to degrade the beer.  Recommend drinking now if you still have any left of this. 1,961 charactersmwilbur, Jan 15, 2013

Pours pitch black with a thin, tan head, very much the same as "regular" BCBS. Some fresh ground coffee aroma is apparent after the pour, but it doesn't stand out that much. The richness and sweetness of BCBS is intact. Bourbon barrel character wafts up from the glass, notes -- charred, oak, cherry, and vanilla. Noticeable fusel alcohol from this fresh bottle (bottled on 11/12/2012).
Flavor is quite sweet, with the anticipated heavy bourbon notes coming through. Effusive barrel character in the form of cherry wood and vanilla. Surprisingly, coffee flavor is quite well hidden and a slight disappointment. What it does seem to have done is to give this more of a straight-up roast character as opposed to the plentiful dark fruit character I tasted in 2012 BCBS. Different, but not necessarily superior or inferior.
The mouthfeel is quite viscous and chewy. Carbonation holds on for a good while without fading much, which is essential in such a big beer that must be sipped slowly. Mouth-coating syrupy texture.
While not as coffee-forward as I'd have liked, BCBCS is a tremendous beer, every bit as worthy as its reputation suggests. I'd give it a very slight edge over BCBS. 1,213 charactersgr0g, Jan 13, 2013

Aroma of dark roasted coffee, roasted malt and bourbon.
Taste follows the nose with strong black coffee, dark roasted malt, hints of dark chocolate with a nice bourbon ending. As the beer came to room temperature the bourbon became a little more dominant.
Mouth Feel is full body, moderate carbonation, thick and smooth with a nice alcohol warming.
Overall is this is an excellent Imperial Stout with a great blend of coffee and roasted malt with a nice touch of bourbon. I was pleasantly surprised that at 14% ABV the bourbon didn't overwhelm the taste. I trul hope I will have an opportunity to enjoy this beer again in the future. 732 charactersdtivp, Jan 12, 2013

S. Has a bourbon coffee aroma. 
T. Just a little too much coffee flavor for me but is understandable considering it needed to be told apart from the black labeled imperial stout.
M. Goes down real smooth with a bite at the end
Overall an above average barrel aged stout. Just a little too much coffee. 352 charactersSpectre, Jan 11, 2013

A: Pours a near pitch black color with a quickly receding dark brown head
S: Lots of coffee, bourbon, vanilla, oak, and caramel. Pretty much as billed: BCBS with lots of coffee
T: Follows the nose. Starts off with with lots of bourbon, oak and vanilla character along with a good amount of coffee. Alcohol very well hidden. Coffee lingers for a while. Again, as billed: BCBS with coffee
M: Full bodied with low-moderate carbonation. Smooth and creamy
O: The coffee adds a nice layer of complexity to an already very complex beer. Of course a little pricey, but worth it. Recommended 614 charactersBEERMILER12, Jan 11, 2013

A: Pours deep black. Completely opaque. Two fingers of huge mocha head dissipate quickly.
S: Huge coffee notes. Bourbon, chocolate and roasted malt. Lingering caramel sweetness. Maybe the biggest coffee nose on a beer I've ever experienced.
T: Like drinking a mocha cappuccino with a splash of bourbon. Tons of coffee without the common astringency that comes with it. Bitter chocolate, vanilla, caramel and nicely balanced bourbon notes. Hides the alcohol well.
M: Thick and creamy. Perfect mouthfeel. Not thin at all for a beer this big.
O: Easily the best coffee stout I've ever had. This is the beer I wished KBS would be. Huge coffee and chocolate. Perfectly balanced barrel presence. One of the best BA beers I've had, probably only behind Bourbon County Vanilla and Bourbon County Rare. Amazing. 840 charactersvonnegut21, Jan 10, 2013

Look dark as expected. I would have expected better lacing.
Smells pretty darn good but you definitely have to be in the right mood for this smell.
Good taste. Sweet, not surprisingly. Coffee is there but not overwhelming. Good bitterness left after swallowing.
The viscosity feels appropriate. Good carbonation.
Again, a good imperial stout, but just doesn't get me overly excited. 555 characterschakadrum, Jan 08, 2013

Midnight black in color with absolutely no light penetrating in any way. Thin tan colored head that dissipates fairly quickly. 
Lots of coffee upfront on the nose; the espresso is very noticeable but also inviting and blends well with the bourbon and barrel characteristics. 
Taste is also big on coffee, although it is very well balanced. Just a well-rounded and tasty beer. The alcohol is also very well hidden. 
A very good take on the BCBS and absolutely worth a try. 558 charactersCaptDavyJones, Jan 06, 2013

It is a very dark brown with some tinges of mahogany. There was a small tan head that left a tiny bit of lace.

Taste a nice balance of milk chocolate and strong coffee.
This was a smooth, almost creamy beer. The alcohol was very well hidden.
I would buy this again, even at $20 a bottle. 396 characterslordofthewiens, Jan 05, 2013

Pours a deep dark black with a finger of dark mocha colored head which dissipates quickly. The aroma is as expected, the sweet blend familiar from BCBS of bourbon, chocolate, and a little vanilla, this time with coffee. The taste is an assault on the taste buds of chocolate, bourbon, some slight oak and coconut notes. The mouthfeel is heavy bodied with good carbonation. Being a big stout it should be thick, and it is - viciously so. But it is also silky smooth and just coats the mouth with all the wonderful flavors at hand.
This was a 2011 vintage, so as expected, the coffee presence took a little hit, but it's still there, and it all balances nicely together. One of the best stouts I've had. 754 charactersmkotsayfan, Jan 05, 2013

This updated review had to be truncated due to reaching the character limit. This could and should be rectified by letting members rate a beer more than once (maybe just in the case of new vintages) or removing the character limit on reviews. I have left just the "Overall." I will add that this is weaker than I remember in most aspects: less coffee, thinner, poor head and retention, and less "complete." 
O: As is visible below, I gave the 2012 edition of this beer a perfect 5, and while I cannot be sure whether it was youthful naïveté, better tasting abilities, palate change, or an actual decline in quality, this is not the same beer I loved and lauded then. Coffee seems restrained, the appearance and mouthfeel are way off, and it just does not come together quite as perfectly. I will not be so ignorant as to claim that this is the fault of pasteurization (it is not), and I do not think it has anything to do with Anheuser Busch's ownership. Perhaps it just seemed so special then because there was nothing else like it. Regular BCBS is still fantastic, unique, and one of the best on the market, though, so that seems equally unlikely. Whatever the case, this is still up there with some of the best BA coffee stouts (and it crushes KBS, oft-mentioned in the same breath and well overdue for a rereview on my part given my astronomical score for it), it just disappoints when compared (admittedly unfairly) to my memories of BCBCS gone by. Pair with Protest the Hero's solid but disappointing "Pacific Myth," another stop on the slide since original members began departing. 4.25/5
2012
A: BCBCS pours an extremely dark brown, bordering on midnight black, but has a surprising half finger of dark khaki, almost reddish head (a lot for a bourbon-finished imperial stout of 14.3% ABV). Carbonation keeps coming up off the bottom of the glass that is notable by the hot spring-esque bubbling at the top of the syrupy, viscous liquid. Loads of alcohol legs are present, which is absolutely expected. Maybe it is the rarity of this beer swaying this reviewer’s opinion, but this beer looks perfect both stylistically and just as a beer in general.
A: Lots of bourbon sweetness mixes perfectly and thoroughly with fudge, brownies, baker’s chocolate, and, of course, fresh espresso/coffee. This beer smells impossibly good. No hops really come through, but the base beer also does not have any real hop profile. Vanilla is also present slightly. There is coffee bitterness, but this is mostly a sweet, sugary bomb; that is perfectly okay with this reviewer’s olfactory senses.
T: Vanilla, chocolate, caramel, toffee, boozy bourbon, and just a hint of coffee and espresso (that comes out more as the beer warms) are all here in spades, and the beer keeps this complexity in check fantastically so that all the flavors shine evenly and complement one another. There is very little bitterness to speak of whatsoever, except a slight coffee taste (which, again, comes out a lot more as the beer warms). There are overtones of brown sugar and burnt, roasty malts as well. More bitterness would help balance the beer, but honestly the developing nature of this beer (something present in nearly all great beers) overshadows any real problems.
M: Just syrupy enough to stick around the mouth, but not to the point that it is a struggle to put down. The moderate carbonation is a surprise, and a welcome one at that, because it keeps this beer impossibly drinkable for its ABV. The bourbon definitely warms the throat, but pleasantly so. This is a great complement to the taste.
Overall: It took a nearly a year, but I finally have my first perfectly scored beer. The only real fault that this elixir has is the lack of immediate bitterness to balance out the extreme (yet not cloying) sweetness. It improves upon 2012 BCBS in every way, and is simply as close to perfect in every way as is possible. If more of this is what will come of GI’s purchase by AB/InBev, I, for one, welcome our new macro overlords. 5/5 4,082 charactersTHANAT0PSIS, Jan 05, 2013

Pours a pitch black color with an inch of thick, brown head. The aroma is a big whiff of booze along with roasted malts, chocolate and vanilla. Not noticing much coffee. The taste is bourbon upfront followed by the coffee. Sweet and boozey but not cloyingly sweet. Vanilla and coffee towards the end. Warming alcohol finish. Honestly, there isn't a huge difference between this one and the regular Bourbon County. You can taste some coffee but there isn't a whole lot. Heavy mouthfeel. $20 for 1 bottle compared to $24 for a 4 pack of Bourbon County makes this a one time buy; maybe pick up a second for the right price to age. Overall, its a damn fine beer but just isn't a major change from the Bourbon County. 794 charactersPicoPapa, Jan 04, 2013

S - Scents of vanilla extract, dark chocolate, and toasty malts lie beneath a scent of whiskey. As the beer warms the scents become more noticeable. There is a slight aroma of coffee, but it seems distant.
T - Flavor matches the smell. A hearty flavor of rich malt, sweet vanilla and chocolate, and a warming burn of bourbon. There is really very little coffee in this. Not sure if previous years were more noticeable, but without straining to find it I would barely be able to separate this from BCBS. Overall, the complexity and uniqueness of GI's bourbon stouts is what makes htis a highly enjoyable beer.
M - Thick, rich and heavy feel. Coates everything in an oil slick of cough syrup consistency. This is a sipping beer to enjoy slowly.
O - I'm glad to have tried it, but for whatever reason it is very similar to its base beer. Still an awesome beer but temper the hoopla accordingly. 996 characterssocon67, Jan 03, 2013

A-Thick jet black pour that leaves a very thin tan/mocha color head.
S-I get a straight shot of bourbon. I can't pick up too much else, since the bourbon is so strong.
 Does have a slight coffee smell. More of a roasted coffee bean. Dark chocolate.
T-To me this taste almost exactly like regular Bourbon County. I get very little coffee. Taste of chocolate, vanilla, bourbon, and a little coffee. When I smell this beer I get just a huge bourbon smell, but when I taste this beer I don't get as much of the bourbon taste. Don't get me wrong, I definitely taste the bourbon, but the other flavors of chocolate, vanilla, come through more than the smell for me.
M- I love how this beer feels in the mouth. Although this beer is a sipper to me, it feels great in the mouth. A full body beer that is thick and really everything I want in a strong stout. Winter beer at it's finest.
O-I really enjoy the Bourbon County Stouts. This is my first time trying coffee and wish I picked up more of the coffee flavor. Could just be me. Thought it wasn't quite as thick as regular, but still very nice. Overall, still a damn good and very well balanced barrel aged stout. 1,228 charactersNaters333, Jan 02, 2013

M- Maybe a little thinner than regular BCBS but still amazing none the less. Just enough carbonation but still silky smooth on the tongue. 
O- A good variation of BCBS. Not as much coffee flavor as I would have liked or expected but it didn't disappoint. I definitely overpaid for this beer at $25 before tax but it was definitely an awesome beer. 852 characterscquinn17, Jan 02, 2013

T- Wow... This is one awesome tasting beer. Vanilla and oak up front, followed by a warming bourbon flavor. Very little of the ABV comes through at all. Truly amazing, one of the best beers I've ever tasted. Slight flavors of dark fruits are there as well...Cherries and plums... Very nice!
MF- Not quite as full as I was expecting, but just as silky smooth as it should be. Incredible. Again, not as thick as I thought it would be, but the texture is fantastic and the flavors linger for a long time! 916 charactersLtCracker20, Jan 01, 2013

S- Bourbon, freshly scraped vanilla pods, creamy milk chocolate and of course... freshly brewed coffee. Hints of lovely toasted oak, roasted cashews, dates wrapped in prosciutto, dried cherries, mission figs, and perfectly roasted grains.
T- Damn! I haven't had this since 2010... I forgot just how incredible this is! Vanilla beans, succulent milk chocolate pudding with whipped cream, just enough notes of bourbon to wake up the taste buds, deep and round dark fruits... figs, dates, raisin. Slightly over roasted nuts and touches of slightly sweet/bitter coffee. This is like a Mocha Milkshake! It's a damn near perfect RIS! 
M- Creamy, sweet, bitter, oily and full of more flavor than any 10 RIS' should have! I wish I could get mints with this flavor! 
O- I've had RIS' with slightly better mouthfeel, smell and legs... but none have really tasted as this little piece of the "Hall" genious year after year. What they started, and has continued without them, is just a drinking experience like no other. 1,233 charactersThickfreakness, Jan 01, 2013

A: Pours a jet black color with no light seeping through the glass. A nice brown head forms and dissapates very quickly. No lacing whatsoever.
S: Huge hints of coffee right off the bat. As it warms the other flavors attack the nose. I smell huge amounts of chocolate, vanilla, and just the right amount of bourbon.
T: The coffee is just freaking fantastic. This beer just keeps tasting better and better as it warms up. My first thought after drinking this is how can this be 14% alcohol. It is so well hidden in the taste as the Vanilla, Chocolate overshadow the Bourbon. The Bourbon is there though but not in an overpowering way.
M: Very smooth and easy drinking. Little to no carbonation. Almost like an alcoholic Jamocha shake at Arbys.
O: This should be illegal in the lower 48 it's that good on the palate. Like I said in the taste comments, it's hard to fathom that this is a 14% beer. 1,023 charactersFinatic, Dec 31, 2012

Only the slightest hint of light penetration at the outermost rim of the beer's body. A vertical pour births a cloudy, vibrant hunk of mocha colored head. It bubbles off to essentially nothing. Almost zero lacing.
S-A truly ambrosial aroma. Top-tier, cold extra-bold Colombian coffee. Wet coffee grounds sitting in a coffee filter. Deluxe dark chocolate truffle. Smells just like Kahlua liqueur. Underneath the beautiful coffee and chocolate is some concentrated vanilla extract. Oh and of course…the bourbon. All aromas dance perfectly with one another.
T-All I can think of is "who snuck a shot of bourbon into my expensive coffee"? It's amazing how easy it is to decipher the quality of the coffee used here. The coffee imparts its own flavors within itself. The chocolate notes are smooth and plush. Again, like the nose, the bourbon is perfect. It delivers a lingering tickle of alcoholic pleasure. Each sip adds new dimensions of flavor. It just all morphs into one giant, rich, classy drink.
M-Viscous and oily. The bourbon makes the alcohol hedonistically enjoyable. It drinks far easier than it should. The feel is excellent. Carbonation is nearly flat. Body is luscious. 
O/D-This is an exponential improvement upon the normal Bourbon County Brand Stout. Bourbon County Coffee is just so much more finely tuned and trained. I am very grateful to have tried this artisanal creation. Easily one of the best Stouts I have ever laid lip to. 1,511 charactersVelvetExtract, Dec 30, 2012

4.69/5  rDev +2.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Poured aggressively from a 22 oz bottle into a snifter. Purchased in Wakefield, RI.
A- Pours an opaque black body with a beautiful (but small) milk chocolate colored head the reduces quickly and leaves little lacing. Not suprising considering the high abv. 
S- Very inviting. Sweet vanilla bourbon, roasted coffee, toasted malt. Not overpowering. 
T- Starts off with a sweet bourbon note- particularly caramel with a touch of vanilla. This develops into a slightly boozy roasted coffee note, definitly a darker style of coffee. Finishes with a dark chocolate-toffee flavor. Quite a trip.
M- Just as thick and creamy as the other BCs. This is the real shining point of these brews in my opinion. silky smooth with low carbonation.
Another great from Goose Island. Very similar to the original BCBS with slight coffee character. Worth the money and hype, pick some of these up before the shelves are empty. 909 charactersgcamparone, Dec 30, 2012

Bittersweet fresh oily coffee bean aromas highlight the front of the nose, all those classic BCBS notes, vanilla and bourbon and caramel and oak and awesome. Super smooth, no apparent alcohol character. Splendid. It's a perfect blend that you don't stumble across many times in life.
What can I say? It's nearly a perfect beer... the oaky bourbon blends seamlessly with the fresh coffee profile... nutty stout characteristics take a back seat to some well-executed dark and dirty breakfast booze... remarkable. 
Could you even improve on this? That's a genuine question. I don't think you could. 751 charactersyamar68, Dec 30, 2012

This beer was served lightly chilled in a snifter. 
A- The body of the beer is inky black. No ruby opaqueness is noted when held against the light. This is exactly like I like my coffee. If you can see through the glass of coffee it is far too weak! The head of the beer is a burnt tan coloration and resolves into a ring of foam. No lacing noted on the glass.
S- The aroma of darkly roasted coffee and bourbon are dominate. Darkly roasted and toasted coffee with a hint of char, molasis, vanilla, brown sugar, burnt sugar notes. A bit boozey but in a good way. 
T- Wow! Dam near a perfect coffee delivery. Dark roasted coffee without oilyness or astringency. The base beer shines out with cocoa, dates, brown sugar with a coda of bruelleed sugar. Bourbon notes shine throughout the flavor. 
M- Full bodied and plenty viscous. Low carbonation works well with the beers character. The beer is heavy in a great sort of RIS way. Minimal alcohol and very smooth on the finish. 
O- This is a dam near perfect beer drinking experience. 1,084 charactersnlmartin, Dec 28, 2012

Very dark, slightly brown on the edge. No head on the pour. Strong black coffee aroma. The taste is still dominated by chocolate, per the base beer, but the coffee is in there battling it out. Surprisingly carbonated in the mouth and as a result comes across lighter than you'd expect. Finishes with a strong alcohol kick.
Side-by-side with other variants, it's clearly better than Cherry Rye, very different but on par with Bramble Rye, and all lose to Vanilla. 484 characterskscaldef, Dec 27, 2012

Appearance: Poured very dark brown, almost black, going into the glass. About a half finger of a dark brown head that dissipated quickly, leaving only a slight ring around the edges. Minimal lacing. Once in the glass, the beer completely opaque black with no light getting through. 
Smell: First thing that comes through is the bourbon followed by chocolate, coffee, vanilla, caramel, slight booziness. I could probably sit here and just smell this beer for hours.
Taste: Sweet vanilla, toffee, bourbon. Coffee comes into play more in the finish. Lingering aftertaste of coffee, vanilla and bourbon. You can taste the alcohol a bit more as it warms, but this in no way tastes anywhere close to a 14.3% beer. Incredibly smooth considering its ABV.
Mouthfeel: Full bodied, slick, creamy. Medium leaning towards light carbonation. Gentle warming sensation in the back of the throat after it goes down. 
Overall: Simply put, this beer lives up to the hype. It hits all the points a good imperial stout should, plus the bourbon barrels and coffee give it even further layers of flavor and complexity. Brews like this one are why I love craft beer. I highly recommend seeking this one out.
Update 12/17/2013: Drinking the 2013 version and I'm getting much less bourbon barrel character and it's significantly more coffee forward. Still an amazing beer, but a small step down from the 2012 batch. 1,477 charactersJonada, Dec 26, 2012

Pours a pitch black with a thin head into my glass. I noticed that there didn't seem to be much carbonation for some reason. Still looks pretty damn evil.
Lots of bourbon that masks the underlying flavors of roasted coffee and cocoa. I'm sure that with some age, the bourbon will quiet down. I just hope that the taste isn't dominated exclusively by bourbon.
Bourbon, light cream, cocoa and roasted coffee make themselves known. The bourbon is surprisingly restrained and alcohol heat enters the equation, warming the mouth.
Lingering warmth, bourbon and roasted coffee make up the finish. Mouthfeel is also slick in spots. Again, alcohol warmth warms the throat. 
An excellent example of its' style that should age fairly well over the years. I'd put a bottle away for aging if I were you. 936 charactersBrad007, Dec 26, 2012

A: Pours a pitch black color. Much like regular BCBS, the dark tan head fades away to nothing in little time. Nice alcohol legs.
S: Smells quite similar to BCBS, with bourbon, chocolate, dark fruits, cream, and brown sugar...right up until rich, exquisite black coffee makes itself known. This is such a joy to inhale, even over regular BCBS. Wow.
T: It's BCBS with coffee. No, that doesn't sound terribly descriptive, but the coffee used is completely fabulous, and plays perfectly with the big sweetness and decadence of the base beer. Tiny little subleties of cream, vanilla, hazelnut, dark fruits, bourbon, and rare (just kidding about that one) give it real enjoyability factor. A little booze pops up in the finish, but not nearly enough to suggest it's 14.3%. This one will completely wreck me in the morning...
M: This doesn't seem to feature the syrupy heft of the base beer. Rather, it's drier and thinner, featuring carbonation that seems to be a bit more vibrant. Still an amazingly sticky and viscous coffee stout. The flavor intensity and finishing booze still suggests one to 'sip'. Actually, I kind of prefer the feel of this over standard BCBS.
O: I didn't think this would be much better than BCBS - but I was wrong. Even though it's quite boozy, it's one of those offerings where the intense flavors render that problem moot. I'd even say it lives up to the hype. Good luck killing a bomber solo if you've already had a few drinks tonight, though...my body is saying 'no' but my tastebuds are saying 'fuck yes!' 1,606 charactersThisWangsChung, Dec 26, 2012

I resisted scoring it as a "5" across the board because then what would be the point of continuing to drink beer if I had found the perfect beer (I say somewhat sarcastically)
As with most good imperial or double stouts, the appearance in the glass was jet-black and opaque.
The smell was a STRONG mix of sweet bourbon and good, black coffee. 
The mouthfeel was thick and velvety and it felt like it coated the inside of your mouth with every sip.
The taste was a combination of bourbon and coffee with some vanilla and sweet candy mixed in. It was a very sweet beer and I wish I could specify the sweetness a little better but it was just a really good general sweetness. 819 charactersmjpolzin, Dec 25, 2012

A- BCBCS pours a black cola head with a strong foamy head that rips, roars, and then disappears. Once the kackling disappears, the foam recides to the edges of the glass. Just a little mocha lining on the corners
S- vanilla, cream, and a light roasted coffee scent partner with some chocolate and roasty flavors.... And of course the bourbon. While the scent is not overpowering, it boasts deliciousness
T- Cream, vanilla, oak flavor begin the initial profile of the brew. A smooth chocolate coffee flavor follows that seems to beat out the bourbon slightly. Just an excellent coating flavor that accelerates throughout the tasting. So many themes going on, it's great
M- creamy and coating flavors that make sure they don't over power the palate
O- BCBCS is amazing. To make a brew that treats every property as an enhancement to the brew is amazing. I will give one negative.... NEED MORE BLACK COFFEE FLAVOR. It would then be a 5/5 1,107 characterslovindahops, Dec 23, 2012

Brewed a little over a month ago (“BOTTLED ON 11/12/12” printed big on the label).
A: Dark black-brown color with a silky dark brown head, exhibiting a thick and creamy appearance. Very little lacing and retention, though.
S: One bold, satisfying coffee scent over a chocolaty, malty body. Aromas of spent grounds, roasted grain, Irish cream, and spicy cinnamon are telltale signs of the quality of these beans – impressively rich and complex character. Balance comes with syrupy chocolate and sugary marshmallow cream flavors, though deep, oaky bourbon is palpable. An absolutely delicious nose; the coffee plays wonderfully with the residual sugars.
T: The heat of a viscous, boozy palate envelopes everything about this beer; yep, that’s Bourbon County. Stings with a bit of piney, earthen hops as it lights the fuse of alcohol and smoke, a profile that crackles and dries for the rest of the palate. A powerful whiskey barrel flavor remains taut as baking chocolate and maple take the spotlight for a moment or two, hastily succeeded by vanilla, raisin, and a generally syrupy sugariness. It’s an alcohol-laden stout, but the caramel maltiness is represented boldly in layers of dark fruit and bready pumpernickel. Finishes with tastes of bitter cola and dark chocolate, smooth but sharp on the edges.
M: A bit thin for a beer this menacing, but that’s ok – means I can drink more of it before feeling too full. Warms at first, but you quickly get used to its boozy intensity.
O: A much better beer than the standard Bourbon County Brand Stout. Now, is it worth $20 a bomber? I’d say no. But for a one-time experience, this was great – chocolaty, thick, and with impressive ranges for the coffee tones. A must-try. 1,911 charactersBarryMFBurton, Dec 18, 2012
5/5  rDev +9.2%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5DISCLAIMER: this beer is not for the faint of heart. are you looking for a hoppy and or malty stout, find something else to drink! Having tried the normal bourbon county before i got my hand on this, i thought i could not find a better stout. Having said that, i LOVE coffee stouts (Great River's "Redband" being my favorite) and i LOVE bourbon and bourbon stouts (give me some Buffalo Trace and or any bourbon stout - havent found a bad one yet) So if you dont like coffee stout and or bourbon stout DONT TRY THIS ONE!
appearance" pours blacker than the blackest black! thin very dark brown head that quickly vanishes.
aroma: Sweet with fairly strong coffee as well as bourbon very readily apparent, the coffee aroma is different though (every coffee aroma is more than likely always going to differ depending on the beans, roast, style and way in which the coffee was brewed i suppose, chalk another layer of complexity up there for great beer, kiss my grits wine!) there is also some burnt malts with carmel and vanilla.
medium low carbonation, rather smooth on the palate. coffee flavor really comes to the forfront on this one just like the bourbon does on the normal one. there is also some bourboniness to this one too, (I was nervous about this at first but its really great) the coffee lingers then you get this awesome explosion of bourbon in the aftertaste!! Then comes that indescribable warming effect on the esophogus and into ye ole belly.... as Veruca Salt would say in the original Willy Wonka "I can actually feel it"...ahhh nevermind. this one is COMPLETLY PERFECT in EVERY manner!! (I know i said that about the original one.... but this is even better!!!) buy this if you like coffee and bourbon, buy two... or leave them both for me! 1,759 charactersBeerlover, Dec 18, 2012

T: wow, this is an amazing tasting brew. Everything you loved about bourbon county, the chocolate and bourbon, but the addition of coffee gives a roastyness and bitterness that helps balancing out the sweetness of the stout. Dangerously drinkable because of it. 
M: creamy and smooth, nice carbonation. Flavores take over your mouth and linger, I can't wait for the next sip. Can't see how this is 14%. PERFECT.
O: I had this after trying BlAck Tuesday for the first time and I preferred this one. Just as flavorful but the creaminess and roasted coffee make this flawless. I rarely have beers i consider 5s but i dont really see how this could improve.

I thought the coffee character would dissipate after a couple of years in the bottle. Not true. While I hesitate to say it improves with age, this one definitely holds up well with time.
Two 2010 Bottles (sampled one fresh and the other after two years in the cellar)
I also tried at NOTLA on cask (notes not reflected here) and loved the gravity-fed version. 606 charactersPrinceDarren, Dec 15, 2012

A: Pours the blackest of blacks. Mocha colored head, however I didn't pour much of a head on this one because I wanted a few extra sips in there.
S: Smells of coffee beans and then vanilla/ bourbon. However the bourbon smell is a little faint and airy. Good stuff.
T: Holy god. Bourbon overtakes my palate in vanilla-ey goodness. Perhaps the best part of this beer is the fact that the coffee flavor kicks in right when the alcohol burn should be and I love this. Super complex and that's the way I like it. 
M: Full bodied, definitely a dessert beer. Low carbonation which is great with this style.
Overall: This may be the best beer I've had so far in my beer drinking life. Super complex and the sweetness of the bourbon works ridiculously well with the coffee flavors. Now I know why this is so hard to come by. Off to the liquor store to buy more of these. Amazing! 966 charactersRichD, Dec 15, 2012

A: Black, brown edges. Small brown head that thins out very quick. No lacing.
S: Nice roasted coffee right away and then vanilla from the bourbon. Deep roasted malts, rich chocolate and bourbon. Smells like heaven.
T: Not surprising, but it's a lot like BCBS with a nice roasted coffee taste. The bourbon does taste a bit more muted compared to the regular but maybe because of the coffee. Finishes with a nice coffee aftertaste that is slightly acidic.
M: Fuller body, not as full or thick as the regular. Light carbonation.
O: Good drinkability. ABV is well hidden. Awesome, world class beer. 618 charactersherman77, Dec 14, 2012

A - Black as night, heavy poor lead to thin head in an 10oz snifter. Dark tan head remains around the rim of the glass
S - Dark robust coffee infused with bourbon immediately followed toffee and vanilla. It is truly a very robust dark coffee smell. The closest true coffee smell I have had from a beer... need I say more
T - All ideal robust coffee notes are present followed by toffee vanilla, butterscotch, bourbon and rich dark chocolate. Ending predominantly with bourbon coffee and chocolate. The tastes and different notes from this beer seem to get richer and more full as you let the beer air out and warm up. 
M - Very rich
O - If you have the chance to get this ... you absolutely should. I was very impressed with the true coffee flavors and aroma from this beer. I have had many coffee stouts and this one is a true winner. 859 charactersjdprmd, Dec 13, 2012

4.53/5  rDev -1.1%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Presentation: 2012 vintage bottled on 11/12/2012. Served exactly one month after bottling. Chilled and poured into my Portsmouth Brewery tulip glass. 
Appearance: Pours a really nice, dark brown, two finger head. The head retention is noticably better than the regular Bourbon County. Inky blak in color.
Aroma: Robust roasted coffee beans, caramel, espresso and vanilla dominate. The booze heat and bourbon tones feel more subdued than in regular Bourbon County. Dark chocolate and coconut notes complement the coffee very nicely.
Taste: Coffee beans and caramel notes come to the forefront. Not bitter or thin at all. The sweetness from the base beer and the barrels really keeps the bitterness from the coffee from being noticable. Big vanilla, bourbon and coconut notes create a really nice, balanced barrel aged stout. The coffee is really nice, but the fudge cake and the booze heat from the base beer is a little covered up from the beans. Really well balanced.
Mouthfeel: Full bodied and creamy. Low carbonation.
Overall: A really nice variation of teh regular Bourbon County. The chocolate cake and huge heat from the base are tempered by really smooth coffee. Extremely balanced for the ABV. The fresh burst of coffee is really well done. The execution is pretty flawless. As good as this variation is, the heat, barrel, and huge malt bill feel a little covered up. Really excellent fresh. I don't see this improving much with age. Certainly an excellent beer and a fast favorite. Still behind Rare and regular aged Bourbon County for my favorite of the series. 1,576 charactersGosox8787, Dec 13, 2012

S: Bourbon, oak, coffee (duh), leather and hints of chocolate and vanilla. 
T: Similar to nose. Really well rounded and less booziness than one would expect from the smell. 
More chocolate and vanilla in the taste than on the nose. Some acidity/bitterness from the coffee.

Shared a bomber: pour my portion into a snifter. Pours really dark, viscous liquid with a small amount of tan foam, mainly around the perimeter of the glass. A lot of activity on the nose: bourbon, of course, plus a raisin sweetness, and a general dark chocolate roastiness. The coffee has faded a significant amount, but all of the other flavor blend together so well: just a roasty, dark chocolate, decadent treat. It reminds me of drinking a glass of flourless chocolate cake that has been soaking in booze. 551 charactersChiPool, Dec 10, 2012

S: Buttery and boozy. Some very subtle chocolate and coffee.
T/M: Big, rich and very boozy. Lots of alcohol from the bourbon, here somewhat softened and smoothed out by the coffee, which is not a dominant presence but provides a rich, roasty, slightly bitter edge to the buttery, bourbon-rich flavor of this stout. Goes down smooth and easy considering its high ABV.
O: Just about as good as the regular BCBS. The coffee is integrated very subtly and adds some nice details to an already complex sipper. I would have thought there'd be more coffee here, and more to differentiate this variation from the regular version, but it's still an amazing beer. 735 characterssevenarts, Dec 09, 2012

Appearance: Dark as hell with a small head that quickly fades to the perimeter of the glass only.
Smell: Coffee, booze and Bourbon, Damn!
Taste: Pretty much matches up to the smell, it's what you'd expect, albeit a bit boozy at the end. Coffee, Bourbon, vanilla, caramel, roasted malts and dark chocolate all unfold before the slight burn of alcohol in the finish. Must say that this definitely doesn't drink like 14%...this is very smooth for a young beer. Comparably, I had some fresh Mad Elf yesterday, and although I know it's a different style, the alcohol was so apparent, it really affected my enjoyment of the beer. A year plus in the cellar must turn this into coffee stout of the gods, color me impressed.
Mouthfeel: Very smooth, not much carbonation to speak of. Not quite as viscous as the 2 year old Founders Imperial Stout I had earlier, but it's certainly velvety.
Overall: As a fresh brew, I have to admit, I like this better than regular BCBS. In the cellar after a year or two, I'm sure they go toe to toe. However, I feel that the added coffee in this variation subdues the Bourbon you taste, even though it's still there, and balances the beer so damn well. Can't imagine how good this will taste in a year+. KBS, beware! 1,259 charactersPsilohsaiBiN, Dec 09, 2012

Smells of coffee bean. bourbon is not too heavy. 
Taste is like the nose. Coffee beans followed by bourbon. Finish is roasted coffee and a little heat. Tastes like if the chocolate covered espesso beans were a boozy stout. As it warms the sweet bourbon comes through.
Mouthfeel is oily coffee, in the best way.

A- Pours a thick and dark black color, no light coming through whatsoever. A small amount of a caramel colored head quickly fades. Very little carbonation is noted, and lots of lacing can be seen along the sides of the glass.
S- Smells like regular BCBS ramped up on coffee. Great coffee notes come through, as well as chocolate, dark fruits and oak. The bourbon is also very notable in the smell too. 
T- Awesome stuff, A pleasant take on regular BCBS. Tons of coffee and chocolate notes up front. Some hints of dark fruit and vanilla is in there too. The oak and bourbon flavors finish out the taste. 
M- Thick, little carbonation, hot but in my opinion not as hot as regular. The coffee gives it more drinkability, no way I would guess this is 14% ABV. 
This is a great beer. It's hard to say that something is better than regular BCBS, but I feel I enjoyed this more. The coffee notes make it much more drinkable to me. Definitely try and get your hands on some. I hate to hype beers up too much, but this probably one of the best beers I have ever had. 1,210 charactersvic21234, Dec 03, 2012

A- Pours like BCBS should: oil-slick black. No head, but a ring of mocha-colored foam around the edge of the glass. Huge legs. 4.
S- Amazing. HUGE blast of fresh-pressed coffee, bourbon, wood, vanilla, coconut, cinnamon(?!), chocolate/fudge/cake batter. Should I go on? 5.
T- Follows the nose to a "T". Starts off with waves of freshly ground coffee...the good stuff none of that bagged Harbucks dogsh#t.

Doesn't get much better than this. 4.5.

A - Pours identical to regular BCBS, honestly. Marginal head retention but tons of alcohol legs. 2012 is easily the most robust-looking of the Bourbon County vintages, including variants.
S - Tons of freshly-ground Intellgentsia coffee beans, as fresh as anything I've ever experienced in any coffee shop. Everything else from the base BCBS comes secondary - bourbon, oak, toasted almonds, dark fruit, etc.
T - The coffee comes across as an espresso finish on top of the already excellent base beer, perhaps not as dominant as in the aroma but still a dominant note in the drink. The coffee accent works pretty spectacularly as this warms up. 
M - This drinks with a bit less alcohol warming than the base. Moderate to heavy body, medium and appropriate carbonation, and a lightly dry/tannic finish. 
D - Great stuff, admittedly better than the small tasting I had at this past year's KBS release. You absolutely must drink this as fresh as possible. The coffee aroma is really pretty incredible, better than Breakfast Stout, Speedway Stout, or anything else I've really come across. I'm not much of a coffee guy, but this makes me a believer.
Edit - I lucked out on a fair amount of the 2013 release. On first try, holy lord. It's a lot more in-check and balanced than 2012 with a better coffee taste to it. The newer vintage really shines. 1,444 charactersAuracom, Nov 21, 2012

Poured into snifter 
Appearance: This variant poured a viscous black as night color with no head to speak of even with a hard pour but this is to be expected. Absolutely no light penetrating this at all. Light lacing evident. 
Smell: Well here is where this starts to get interesting! Obviously coffee but also vanilla, dark bakers chocolate, and bourbon. It smells also of fudge and brownie like cake batter. What an intoxicating nose!
Taste: Well here is where this really gets interesting! Again the coffee is up front but the bourbon, vanilla, semi sweet bakers chocolate and fudge brownie are integrated with absolute perfection! This is one hell of a decadent beer that is roasted but sweet, bitter but sweet in that every aspect is balanced on the palate. Can anyone say chocolate covered espresso beans? Wow!!
Mouthfeel: This is where Goose Island is yet to be beat, IMO. This beer is so big and chewy that I must remind myself that I'm drinking and not eating. It coats every nook and crany of the palate with its creamy, thick goodness that it stays in the mouth for what seems like forever. 
Overall: Well I think all the above explains it for me. What else can I say? This is as near perfect as it gets! 1,280 characterssleuthdog, Nov 12, 2012

Poured a muddy black-brown, viscous, with a thin skein of rich mocha head. Smell was all about chocolates and coffee beans roasting at a coffee house. Lightly boozy. Taste follows the nose with cocoa and French roasted coffee, vanilla, raisins, coconut, dark fruits. Rich, complex and decadent without being sweet. Bourbon notes are ever-present but in the background. Perfect balance of bitterness and sweetness. Velvety mouthfeel and body. Really enjoyed this one and not much more to add except this is a world class beer. 542 charactersJackieTH, Oct 24, 2012

***
2010 bottling, sent to me in a really good trade and a bottle I've been wanting to share with my brother. Split with him, with my portion poured into a New Belgium Globe.
A: Dark, dense, opaque body...viscous alcohol feet...quickly receding dark tan head.
S: Big time vanilla and bourbon-y/sweet aromas...huge chocolate presence, hints of caramel, coffee is buried but still noticeable...toasted oak and hints of coconut. Doesn't seem boozy at all.
T: Lots of chocolate and vanilla with underlying mocha, caramel...bourbon notes, flash of sweeter toffee and burnt sugars. Impressed by the amount of chocolate - again, the alcohol is really only felt, not tasted.
MF: Sticky, viscous, and lower carbonation levels. Very full bodied. 
O: Very little coffee in this guy but its still a very good bourbon-barrel-aged stout, as one would expect from a GI BCBS variant. Looking forward to trying this one more fresh. 1,074 charactersScotchboy, Oct 22, 2012

Taste is full on creme brulee, kahlua, spicy alcohol. Oily, viscous mouhtfeel. The 13% here doesn’t batter the palate as much as the normal version.

The pour is a deep mud black. No head, except for a little burble of suds. The smell transports me. Booze comes first, followed by potent, eye opening coffee. So many coffee stouts smell scorched. Not this one. Ahhhh. This drink will wake you up and knock you out all at once.
A while back I had the base BCBS, and found it a bit too boozy. With this beer, the bourbon and the coffee play off each other. Both are present and accounted for, but none too assertive. A little bit of cocoa and a bit of raisin play along in the background.
I so badly wanted to give this beer a 5 overall. But the mouthfeel, while good, isn't quite there to confer perfection. Eclipse among others is just a touch smoother. BCB Coffee is great. Not quite perfect.
Brilliant beer. Cannot imagine there are more than 10 beers in the world better than this guy. 1,030 characterslurpy1, Sep 06, 2012

2010 bottle shared at 10am before hitting the beach as part of the first annual "Trailer Park Tasting" campout! 
Appearance. Deep brown, pretty much black, thick and oily looking, thin dark tan head.
Smell. Sweet, smooth bourbon, fresh (2010???) dark roasty coffee, vanilla, and a little dark roasty malt.
Taste. Dark roasty malts, dark coffee and smooth bourbon, dark chocolate, some dark cherry and bitter wood. Almost no booze at all.
Mouthfeel. Full body, low smooth carbonation. Perfect.
Overall. Just a perfect stout. Perfect amount of bourbon and coffee. 766 charactersRutager, Sep 03, 2012

Poured into a large brandy snifter.
A:	Pours a deep and dark yet clean brown. Opaque at it’s heart but a nice, almost orange/brown transparency appears off its edges in the glass, coloring from the barrels no doubt. A very thin, tan ring of head dissipates quickly. No lacing or retention to speak of, but to be expected out of a 14% ABV. Head completely disappears for good when this beer warms up. You can see medium viscosity as it swirls around the glass, coating the sides in a brownish-orange oily glaze.
S:	Bourbon barrel first, then the wonderful dark, roasty stout aroma we all love. It has a cloying, sweet acidity that mellows out as the beer warms. Perhaps it’s because this beer was bottled in January, 2012 and the coffee oils have faded, but I’m struggling to find coffee in the nose. Less sweet smelling than the basic BCBS. Some booziness in there too.
T:	There’s the coffee! Rich, deep, sweet, roasty, and ever so slightly bitter flavors of chocolate, mostly dark. Mid palate is rich in coffee, giving away to a slight alcohol burn. I also get some nice bourbon vanilla notes on the finish in addition to the booze. This beer has a slightly annoying, acidic, and cloying sweet twang when it is cold, but that mostly goes away as it warms up. This beer definitely improves at room temperature. Very rich and decedent, like BCBS should be.
M:	Medium bodied with little carbonation. Like I said above, it is cloyingly acidic in the mouthfeel while it is cold. As this beer warms up, it becomes more viscous and lush. Rich and decadent with some mouth drying alcohol on what is a nice finish. Chewy and sticky as it warms. Again: Consume it at room temp, not chilled.
O:	Decedent. This is a very rich beer that is improved by warmer serving temps. It bridges the gap between beer and bourbon nicely, all while incorporating the nice roasty finish of coffee. The alcohol burn is pleasing to this fan of scotch and whiskey. It is a great sipper and great to share. There is no way I could finish an entire bottle of this one by myself. The coffee is a nice touch, but not OVERLY present. Perhaps it is because I engage in coffee tastings regularly, and I was looking for some more assertive flavors, but it is still tasty none the less. This is a very well crafted brew and a real treat to split among friends. 2,383 charactersBWHD, Sep 02, 2012

Appearance: Straight black and oily with almost no rim to it, just some mocha bubbles. 
Smell: Bourbon hit my nose right away, as well as some light chocolate notes and subtle coffee. 
Taste: Coffee is more noticeable in the flavor, with a great roasty and full-bodied character. Bourbon isn't over the top, making the coffee center stage, along with burnt malts and some vanilla.
Mouthfeel: Thick, syrupy, and booze. Roasted coffee hangs on the tongue. 
Overall: Had the opportunity to try this side by side with KBS, and I actually think I'd pick KBS if I had to choose between the two. Both are right on point and have some of the best coffee flavors you'll find in a beer. 782 charactersmfavoino, Aug 25, 2012

A: Pitch black. Super aggressive pour leads to a 1 finger hot cocoa foam head that disappears pretty quickly. Not much lacing to speak of.
S: Monster nose. Just humongous. Tons of bourbon, first and foremost followed by coffee, some smoke, some vanilla and hints of black licorice. Unreal nose.

T: Holy $#!+ wow, this may be my new favorite stout (regular BCBS and vintage Abyss used to be my top 2). Starts off with bourbon, vanilla, roasted malt. It's subtle (probably due to age) but coffee is definitely there, adding roasty and bitter flavour. I wish I could try this beer fresh to compare.
M: Thick and syrupy with medium alcohol burn. It's not as thick as regular BCBS (from my recollection).

Stone Snifter
A - Pours pitch black and even with an aggressive pour only a 1/4 inch dark khaki head that turns to nothing immediately. 
S - Shockingly the first thing I get is chocolate and vanilla then coffee and some bourbon. Very sweet smell that leads me to think it's going to be a sweet beer.
T - Wow. Sweet just like I thought but in a good way. I thought the sweetness would overpower but it plays perfectly with the coffee, vanilla and chocolate notes. Some nice roastiness and oak from the barrel.
M - Perfect mouthfeel, thick and oily just like all big barrel stouts should be. Very little carbonation.
O - Another amazing beer from the Bourbon County Series. This beer has all the similar BCBS qualities you get from the series but still stands out on it's own. One of the best beers I've ever had. At 14% this is a great brew to take down by yourself or share with a friend. 906 charactersSkiBum22, Aug 14, 2012

Black with a some brownie cake toned rimmed highlights. Quick dark brown head. 
Warm alcohol, cocoa nibs, cream, ground espresso beans, and some tiramisu. Smells like a strong, flavorful sipper to me. 
Oily and boozey palate from start to finish. This is a HOT beer. Not to say that it's not enjoyable to drink. Chocolate, black, espresso coffee with some creamy buttermilk in essence. The alcohol has a hot, lip singe of a finish. But tha reminds me to drink this for a prolonged period of time. Its oily smooth and hot, once the beer gets to room temperature.

The beer pours a fantastic jet black color, as opaque as can be, no hints of brown when held to the light, just a deep dark abyss. A thin tan head emerges from the beer, but disappears promptly leaving behind no real trace of its existence and no lacing. The aromas are great, huge notes of burnt coffee, roasted malt, sticky bourbon, chocolate, cane sugar, graham cracker, pitted fruit and even perhaps some toasted marshmallow. Aside from Rare, this definitely has my favorite nose from any of the BCBS variants. The flavors are incredibly complex, lots of coffee, bitter and roasted, char, chocolate and graham cracker leap out at first. The bourbon is much more subtle and layered than the other common variants, a bit of marshmallow comes out and closes with some acidity and fruit. I did a bit of reading on the beans that were used for this batch and they are Bolivian beans that are known to have some nice fruit esters and as this beer warms, you can really pick up on the those notes which really balances this beer out without going overboard into the fruit like Bramble does. The one short coming of this beer is the body. It's a bit thinner and at times cola like than most stouts of this size and style, but it's still nice and rich, smooth and relatively silky, just wish it had more bravado in the body.
Verdict: This is a magnificent beer and definitely my favorite of the recurring variants. The coffee adds such a nice elements of roast and char to the beer so it doesn't get overly rich and decadent, but has a nice bitterness to it. The alcohol is almost completely hidden at 14% which is almost unheard of. This beer definitely warrants its praises and is a must try for anyone who loves a good stout, bourbon or cup of espresso. 1,794 characterskevanb, Jul 22, 2012

Bottled on 01/11/12
A: Opaque black color with a partial residue of beige bubbles. Scant lacing remains on the glass.
S: Intensely nutty, moreso than the standard recipe, but also with the expected heaviness of brown sugar and molasses. Bourbon is restrained, marrying well with dark fruit of similar intensity. No alcohol is detected.
T: Begins very sweet, with fruity roasted malt and energetic acidity. Malt is huskier in the middle with molasses and vanilla present. A whiff of alcohol emerges mid-way, with more pure bourbon qualities revealed in its wake. The finish is fairly mild, showing coffee, with some lingering spirit but much drier than it began.
M: Thick viscosity, intensely acidic at first but also very syrupy on the palate, with low carbonation.
D/O: This powerful stout bears a strong resemblance to its un-caffeinated brethren, but is hindered by textural acidity in a way that many imperial stouts are. Coffee is not defining, instead joining other qualities in a nearly seamless collection of barrel-aged sensory experience. 1,099 charactersbeagle75, Jul 16, 2012

Served sightly below cellar temp, this beer pours a deep black with a loose, dark tan head that leaves a slight, oily lacing. The head falls flat quickly...and remains down for the count. This beer has an incredibly bold nose with intense notes of wood and vanilla followed by a rich toffee sweetness. The alcohol fades in the nose faster than expected allowing for more of the other flavors to come through. I'm reminded of maple syrup and molasses while drinking. The same bold flavors present in the nose get down and dirty in this syrupy malt base. It's definitely a slow sipper, although the coffee acidity on the back end helps balance out the beer's intense sweetness. To be honest, the bold coffee flavors and aromas I was expecting are not present; instead the coffee helps build body and balance. Overall I wouldnt say that this beer is extraordinarily different than BCBS, except it has greater chocolaty smoothness and drinkability. I'm always blown away by how drinkable this beer is, but I woud have preferred more roasted bean aroma and flavor. 1,093 charactersThePorterSorter, Jul 14, 2012

pours ink black, some mocha foam and no lace. typical BCBS styling. Smells like BCBS and coffee, maybe some dark prunes and vanilla. It's nice. Flavor follows suit with a good bourbon and vanilla kick followed through with a solid mocha tone. Thick bodied with subdued carb as the beer warmed.

Same look as before. Smells strongly of coffee, too much for me. Below, when I seek it out, the bourbon and stout characters come through, but it's too much work. Flavor is richly coffee'd and with a solid sweet stout accented with bourbon. Full bodied and fleeting carb similar to the '10. I'm not a big fan of this one, although my drinking buddies dig it quite a bit. 3/2.5/3.5/4/3.5 - 3.33 (this is the grade that is recorded) 862 charactersharrymel, Jun 28, 2012

A: Pours pitch black. Despite an aggressive pour I only managed a small espresso colored head out of this one. Fades fairly quickly. Almost no lacing at all.
S: Surprisingly not coffee dominated. Lots of toffee, caramel and vanilla from the bourbon. Strong roasted malt character - loads of chocolate and some char. Coffee bean is also strong but melded nicely with the rest of the aromas, not dominating. Sharp alcohol.
T: Some bourbon up front with sharp oaky vanilla and some toffee. Loads of coffee bean mixed nicely with some chocolate. Lingering strong coffee bitterness and mild char in the aftertaste. Fairly hot, especially up front. Less bourbon presence than normal BCS but it's still there.
M: Heavy, thick, smooth and creamy.
O: A must-have for the coffee stout lover. The coffee doesn't take over the beer but it's still very strong and tasty. I am not a coffee drinker and I think I'd prefer this with at least a year on it to let it settle down a bit. In fact I do have last year's batch as well which I will have to add to this review at some point. I find that I prefer regular BCS over this. Coffee sort of drowns out the complexity and balance of regular BCS. 1,211 charactersDope, Jun 28, 2012

A wonderfully balanced stout. Great roast flavor but without bitterness or astringency. And the roast comes with a rounded sweetness of chocolate.
Nicely full flavor while easy to drink. This stout left me wanting more, and it wasn't so big that it filled me up. 
A nearly perfect beer! 303 charactersbirderbeerer, Jun 18, 2012
5/5  rDev +9.2%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 52012 Vintage, split three ways, with a big cigar
Appearance: this beer pours a "black as night color" from the bottle with just a little toasted marshmallow colored head. The head goes quick though and just leaves midnight black in the glass. As you swirl it, the beer leaves legs like a perfect pour of bourbon
Smell: can smell this from across the room. It is like being in a coffee shop and having the barista drop in a dram of bourbon into your coffee. I found the smell to truly be perfect, as is clear by my rating of this brew. Lots of depth to the aroma- some hidden vanilla and blackberry notes.
Taste: I should just leave this blank, because I was so blown away by how this tasted that I was truly speechless yesterday when we cracked this. Front is pure espresso, roast/toasty notes are unavoidable- then the transformation takes place. Bourbon, toffee, salty caramel, almond, and marshmallow were all easily identifiable. So damn smooth.
Overall: I am not sure what else I could ask for in a beer- puts a 100$ bottle of bourbon to shame.

Pours a thick dark black with a frothy creamy tan head that sticks around for a bit. The aroma is dominated by the coffee but also has some chocolate and a caramel and hints of barrel to round it out quite nicely. The flavor is thick and sweet with a sugary mix of caramel chocolate and coffee. The addition of coffee seems to round out the bourbon and oak of the regular version quite nicely. Thick body with a light level of carbonation and a sweet creamy sugary mouthfeel. This is a big thick sweet monster of a beer that I thoroughly enjoyed. Too bad these are so hard to get. 640 charactersjohnnnniee, Jun 03, 2012

Oily black body with a thin mocha colored cap. Head fades quickly and settles to a spotty layer with some clingy lace around the edges. Sludgy, viscous body that leaves an oily coating inside the glass when swirled. 
Bourbon and coffee leap from the glass and greet your nose with a warm hello. Dark roasted malt, almost nutty in spots, with some sweet dark fruits, rum, vanilla, and dry oak round out an impressive aroma. Bold and daring.
Complex, rich flavors. Enticing, bold, and robust. How many adjectives can I use? Rich milk chocolate rushes onto the palate with bourbon and coffee grinds quickly in tow. Dark fruits, vanilla, dry oak, rum, and molasses all blend together to form one of the most complex profiles I have come across.
Full bodied, lush and velvety. A touch of warming in the finish, but it never overwhelms, considering the 14% abv. Lingering flavor of chocolate covered coffee beans and some ethanol.
Rare is in a class above all other in this series, but the Coffee variant is a damn fine beer. Easily world class. An incredible experience that unfurls new flavors with each sip. Utterly delicious. 1,211 charactersColForbinBC, May 29, 2012

The Rare and Vanilla are seriously a lot better. And if you are not a big coffee fan, this beer is a bit over the top with a massive coffee flavor. So, again, while this is a great beer, don't go overboard to get a bottle...the regular BCBS is a bit better. Enjoy with friends...a bottle on your own is a bit much!
A: Pours a nice deep n' dark pitch black with deep brown head.
S/T: Overloaded with smells and tastes of coffee, coffee, coffee...nice heat with bourbon undertones (coffee somewhat overpowers the vanilla notes)...

The smell is GREAT love BCBS and with the addition of coffee it adds another level to the taste. The beer is like black syrup with little to no head. The smell is of bourbon and espresso orated coffee (huge coffee nose on this one). The taste is outstanding I love what goose island is doing with these beers.

T: the coffee flavors cover up the bourbon and high alcohol, making this slightly more appealing to me than their standard BCBS; of course the chocolate malts and sugary sweetness is present
M: slightly less syrupy than their regular BCBS, and less boozy
O: all of the BCBS are pretty equivalent to me - the coffee stout smells and tastes more of coffee, the vanilla stout smells and tastes more of vanilla, and their regular stout smells and tastes more of bourbon. Only their bramble rye climbs above the rest. These are all great beers, and this is a great coffee stout.

(Raised both Taste and Overall a full point from 3.5/5 to 4.5/5)
Cheers!
Glad my hunting paid off for this one, 22oz bottle poured into snifters at a tasting on 1/27/2012
A- Dark and thick with minimal head, as of course is tradition of huge beers like this.
S- Damn....double damn this is possibly the best smelling beer I've ever encountered! Sweet coffee, bourbon and vanilla flavors greet the nose. I don't even want to drink it this smells so good
T- The first sip tastes like a disappointment. It's obviously a very complex beer but I'm not feeling this particular kind of coffee flavor. It's a very harsh coffee bitterness that leaves an acidic taste in my mouth after finishing. The bourbon and base beer flavors are great but the coffee is a let down.
M- Silky smooth and very coating which I like. I just wish the coffee weren't so brash. 
O- I'll probably try this again next year to see if a different coffee yields a different outcome for my preferences. Glad I got to try this but won't be scouring downtown Chicago for more bottles. 1,386 characterspschul4, May 16, 2012

Vintage 2010 , 03/26/10 #2109
A huge thanks to CaptCleveland for sending this one over in a trade.
A: Pours a moderately viscous opaque black with only the slightest browning on the edges, and 1/2 fingers width of dark mocha colored head, which dissipates down quickly to only an outer ring. Leaves effectively no lacing.  
S: Huge aroma! Bourbon is noted as soon as you open the bottle.  The bourbon character is so strong, and is accompanied by rich dark chocolate, oak, vanilla, coffee ( but not to the degree I anticipated, likely due to the beers age), and a hint of dark fruits. Such a decadent mix of bourbon and fine dark chocolate.  Amazing. 
T: Wow, just great.  Initial sip is bourbon upfront, big coffee on the backend, followed by a rich chocolate lingering in the aftertaste.  I also get vanilla, oak, and roasted malt.  The coffee presence is much more prevalent on the tongue than the nose, bold roast strong black coffee.  The flavors are so powerful and the lingering aftertaste is delicious and hangs around forever.  Complexity is deep and balance is impressive.  An almost perfect mix of bourbon, coffee and chocolate, really astounding. 
M/D: Silky smooth with a nice chewy mouthfeel.  It coats the palate nicely.  Carbonation on the low end of moderate, bordering on but not quite becoming distracting.  There is a touch of heat going down, but otherwise the huge ABV is very well restrained, and it has a nice whole body warming effect. Drinkability is scary good for a 13%'er with a huge flavor profile.  
O: Overall, a simply fantastic beer.  In the top handful of beers I've ever had.  Absolutely world class.   1,694 characterszac16125, May 12, 2012

A- Pours a deep black with a thin mocha head that leaves some spots of lacing.
S- Fresh roasted coffee beans, high quality dark chocolate, slightly burnt caramel, rich bourbon, subtle wood, tobacco, fig, plum and other dark fruits with some vanilla bean. 
T- The fresh coffee beans carry over in the taste that are the star of the show. Cocoa, toffee, bourbon, wood, dark fruits, vanilla and some peppery spice follow.
M- Low to medium carbonation and a slightly syrupy body. So damn smooth and no sign of the abv. Dangerously drinkable. 
O- Wow, this is really damn good. One of the few beers I've had where are no faults I can find. This is one of the best beers I've had period. Have had this fresh on tap and bottled and the bottle was the clear winner. 778 charactersiadler, May 12, 2012

Appearance is pitch black, tiny tan head, some visible carbonation, no real lacing to speak of. Looks like BCBS. 
Smell is a giant blast of coffee, followed by some dark chocolate and fudgy chocolate and the barrel notes - vanilla, toffee, caramel, bit of oak. Really luscious and wonderful. Very sweet, but with some roasty bitterness to balance it out.
Taste is big coffee upfront. It tastes like a fresh brew, not like burnt grounds. This is followed by a melange of chocolate, vanilla, toffee, roasted malts. Finish is a blend of fudge, fresh brewed coffee, a hint of vanilla and a pinch of spice (cinnamon, maybe?) that lasts and lasts. It's got some alcohol warmth, but it's not overpowering at all. The ABV is actually quite well hidden. The flavors meld together really well. It's actually a little difficult to separate them, but the sweetness and the roasty bitterness balance each other out really nicely.
Mouthfeel is full and creamy, with some carbonation cutting through. The carbonation is actually a little more than I would like, and the mouthfeel could be slightly chewier. But it's still excellent.
An absolutely stunning accomplishment. This beer is phenomenal. I don't know if it's just my palate evolving, but I found a 6-month old 2011 to be overpowering with the coffee, but the fresh 2012 is wonderful. 
---
2011 bottle. Major thanks to Agold for hooking me up with this bottle.
Pours a pitch black, with extremely minimal carbonation, next to no head. 4.0
Wow, that is some really strong coffee. You can pick up some of the base beer, which is great. A little bit of boozy sweetness underneath the coffee, maybe a bit of dark chocolate. Kind of bourbon-y oaky thing going on, but mostly just lots of coffee. 4.5
Taste is like the smell. There's some interesting things going on, some light chocolatey sweetness, maybe a little bit of toffee. But mostly I'm just getting lots of coffee. I wish it wasn't quite so heavy on the coffee. It was kind of overpowering for me, unlike the bramble which I found to be well balanced, with the berries complementing the rest of the flavors. Here, the coffee kind of pushes the rest aside. Still very tasty though, don't get me wrong. It's all the right flavors. The coffee was just a little too dominant. Goes down exceptionally smoothly. As always, bourbon county hides the alcohol extremely well. It's hard to believe this is a 13% beer. 4.0
Mouth feel is great, medium-thick. Hardly any carbonation. 4.5
This beer is extremely drinkable. Drinks like a much lower ABV, but still very full. I just wish the coffee was slightly less dominant. 4.5 2,719 charactersrodkin, May 04, 2012

Pours thick, oily, and black. Half-finger of medium-tan head, okay retention, very little lacing. Not the best-looking stout.
Smell is rich, dark, and sweet. Coffee is more prominent here than it is in the taste, and it's quite smooth and pleasant - so many coffee beers feel like the coffee is over-roasted. Stout character is pretty roasty and woody, with coffee overwhelming any smoky or chocolate scents.
Taste: a big, delicious bruiser of a beer. It's an incredibly smooth bourbon barrel stout, and the bourbon blends so well with the stout, with the coffee mostly as an accent. Bourbon is rich, dark, and woody, with a little bit of vanilla. Alcohol is incredibly well-hidden, probably by the near-overload of amazing flavors. So smooth going down.
Mouthfeel is, as I'd expect, thick, heavy, and chewy. Enough carbonation that I have no complaints. As with all the BCBS variants, it's kinda like drinking carbonated oil. But oh-so-delicious oil.
A really freaking good beer. Amazing balance and integration of a lot of strong flavors. One of the most balanced big beers I've had, ever. This is one of those beers you taste and think, this is just right. I hope I get to drink this again, as I savored every sip. 1,361 characterszeledonia, Apr 30, 2012

I've never given 5's accross the board, and don't know if I'll find another beer that will get a perfect score, but this beer is "it" for me in every way. 
It poured a nice thick black color, smelled like coffee, tasted like coffee and bourbon, and finished smoother than silk. For me, I don't need specifics. It was amazing.
Overall, my goal in the future might be to seek out rare beers, just so I can trade them for more bottles of BCBCS. 638 charactersSirWalkAbout, Apr 24, 2012

A - Pours a dark, inky black with a dense mocha head that fades to a slight ring and patchy haze. No surprise here, Bourbon County (and it's variants) is always so pretty.
S - Deep, intense aromas of fine coffee beans, chocolate, Bourbon, molasses, and vanilla. So amazing, and I'm glad to see that the coffee has held up nicely, even after 2 years.
T - More rich coffee and chocolate flavors dominate, with a very nice balance of Bourbon and vanilla. The coffee tempers the usually intense Bourbon character nicely, resulting in a superbly balanced brew (despite the incredibly huge flavors). Molasses and deep roasted malt round out the flavor profile. Decadent doesn't even begin to sum this up.
M - This part of the beer really blows me away. Thick and viscous, with a huge, chewy mouthfeel and low carbonation. Luscious and velvet-smooth, this is like a Bourbon-coffee-chocolate milkshake (which I need to patent asap).
O - Such a ridiculously over the top and amazing beer, so glad I finally cracked into this bad boy. I kinda want to try it fresher now, may need to track down a 2011 version. 1,114 charactersjsanford, Apr 24, 2012

We poured this beer into snifters. It is as black as midnight (shocking!). There was minimal tan head/scum. This scum was pretty sticky, which is also not surprising. This lead to some decent lacing. I really enjoyed the venuous legs on the side of the glass. You usually don't get to see this.
Off the top I smell coffee (big surprise!), tobacco, bourbon, and some very rich vanillian. At the end of each sniff I pick up a decent amount of alcohol presence. There is also a good dose of chocolate. I could just smell this beer and be happy. BUT, I get to drink it as well.
This beer is flavored with rich espresso roast. You get a bunch of vanilla. There is that rich punch of bourbon in each sip. It just lingers there on the tongue after each drink. The flavor was so good that it made me shiver after each drink.
This beer is amazing. It is probably the best beer that I have ever had...EVER! 970 charactersummswimmin, Apr 18, 2012

4.77/5  rDev +4.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.522oz. bottle poured into a snifter. Bottled 1-11-12.
**Re-reviewing this since I had it much fresher than when I initially tried batch 1**
(A)- Pours a nice pitch black color. Some surprising tan froth and lace despite the ABV.
(S)- A great burst of coffee grounds and coffee beans. Bits of barrel oak and raisin/cocoa. Just a great coffee aroma profile.
(T)- Again, the same awesome coffee grounds from the aroma up front. Right behind that is the classic bourbon county rich profile we all know and love. Lots of coffee, cocoa, raisin, caramel, and dry bourbon oak.
(M)- A tad higher carbonation level than normal for bourbon county, but in no way does that hinder it in any way. A great balance of coffee, raisin, cocoa, and rich bourbon barrel oak.
(D)- Far better and superior fresh than the aged first batch bottle I opened. Just an excellent variant on the classic bourbon county.
( Orginal Review)
22oz. bottle poured into a snifter. Bottled on 3-26-10.
(A)- Pours a pitch black color that produced a quickly dissipating brown head. It poured rather fizzy.(4)
(S)- A very rich and decadent vanilla and brown sugar sweetness with some boozy head behind it. Bits of coffee behind it, but very subtle behind all the richness.(4.5)
(T)- Same as the smell. Rich and decadent with some molasses poking through. Where is all the coffee though? The booziness is hiding alot at this point.(4)
(M)- A decent carbonation level that is actually a bit high for my liking in a stout. The boozy heat is hiding most of the great flavors this could have to offer. Still tastes good, but all I really taste is the boozy vanilla from the bourbon barrels.(3)
(D)- This needs some time to age to smooth out its boozy edges. My biggest disappointment actually is where did all the coffee that is supposed to be in this? It is good, but I would not touch this again for another year at least considering how hot this is right now; shows promise for the future. It will take me awhile to finish this on my own.(3) 2,008 characterssweemzander, Apr 16, 2012

4.86/5  rDev +6.1%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5I always approach highly rated beers with skepticism as I know many people get caught up in the reputation of the beer or the brewery's fame. In this case, this beer (the 2011 edition) deserves all the acclaim it gets. 
Like so many strong stouts, the appearance lacks a little since they don't really hold a decent head for long. Which is a shame since this is one of the darkest heads I've seen in a while. The body proved to be as close to black as I've seen. Even as I poured it, no light came through the liquid, but the aroma did waft up and I was in love. It took a while to get that first anticipated sip as I kept going back to breathe in the luscious coffee, bourbon, vanilla, cream and chocolate. It smelled so much like a mocha truffle. In my experience, any beer that smells this good rarely tastes this good. I was not to be disappointed as it tastes exactly like it smells. The roasts and the bourbon kick it off and then the vanilla and chocolate take over for a bit, lingering until the coffee comes through definitively to wash everything out. A note about the chocolate flavor element in this: this seems to deliver more chocolate than almost every stout I've had that's had chocolate added. It's the perfect script to the perfect play. I used luscious in this review already, but that word is appropriate for the body as well. I am reminded of an Allanah Miles song as this billows through my mouth. "Black Velvet" 
This is my first BCBS and I really need to get my hands on the rest of these beers. Goose Island just jumped up into the ranks of my favorite breweries. 1,590 charactersNaugros, Apr 15, 2012
4.64/5  rDev +1.3%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 522oz bottle split three ways. Big thanks to BA morningthief for splitting this beer with me and his wife.
Appearance: Very careful pour yields a small tan ring of almost-head. Pours black with red highlights. No lacing, but nice color.
Smell: Coffee, wood, toffee, all rich and strong, and not boozy at all. The coffee is like freshly ground, high quality coffee beans, and the toffee-like malt flavors are well developed, and seamlessly integrated with the barrel notes. Excellent.
Taste: Tastes like it smells, with a long, creamy toffee candybar finish. Strong, high qualify dark roast coffee up front, balanced by sweet caramel and oak. Despite the strong, decadent flavors, the coffee bitterness, high carbonation, and overall excellent balance keeps the flavor from even approaching "cloying" or "too rich". 
The coffee, while delicious, seems to drown out a lot of Bourbon County's complexity. This wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing, but I don't think the end result is well-edited perfection, but just "some of the amazing elements of BCBS, plus a really good coffee flavor." It's a minor criticism for a delicious beer.
Mouthfeel: Full bodied, high side of moderate carbonation. Not creamy. Hot and boozy. Decently attenuated. 
This is the weakest aspect of the beer, but it's still very well done; the high carbonation and alcohol heat welcomely cut the toffee / cookie / caramel flavors.
Overall: It's not the perfect beer, nor even the best Bourbon County variant, but it's greatness is still undeniable. Plus some points (if there's room for more points) for giving a really beautifully integrated and delicious-in-its-own-right coffee addition. 
You probably know what you're getting into if you managed to secure one of these beers to begin with, and it's unlikely that you'll be disappointed. 1,818 charactersPahn, Apr 15, 2012

Aroma- A nice booze and strong all around stout aroma is present. Light coffee and roast sneaks through and is in the background of this one.
Appearance- Received with a .5, dark brown head that dies very quick. Has an opaque brown colored body and leaves light suds behind afterwards.
Flavor- Huge coffee upfront with a nice blend of booze and malt. Medium-high bitterness at the end and TONS of ingredient included in this one. 
Mouthfeel- Full Bodied, Lightest Carbonation, Smooth as hell, Viscous, and fills you up.
Overall Impression- While I have enjoyed many (3) of these in bottle form this year, the kegged version was very respectable as well! I highly suggest enjoying on-tap if you get a chance. Not sure the availability of cask/tap offerings of this brew are but try seeking it out. 987 charactersDCon, Apr 09, 2012

2011 vintage. Bottled 1/11/12.
Pours an opaque black/brown with a dark khaki head that fades to nothing. No lacing on this one. Smell is of dark roasted malt, coffee beans, cocoa, roasted peanuts, and bourbon. Taste is the same with an alcohol kick on the finish with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel.

pours out a thick oily opaque black. about one finger of fizzy brownish colored head that faded to a very thin ring, and eventually by the end of the glass nothing. some nice legs visible, not really any lace to speak of. a little bit of an oily residue noticable on top of the beer, perhaps from the coffee beans? 
big boozey bourbon aromas initially at the forefront, but lots of complexities behind the strong bourbon. vanilla bourbony oak, burnt sugars, molasses. a bit of coffee bean aroma comes in the more it warms, but the bourbon still really dominates. i maybe expected more coffee to the aroma, but as it really warms up some nice mocha like espresso blends with the complexities. 
wow, what a taste. everything the aroma has, but intensified 10x plus more. again, lots of boozey bourbon at the forefront. burnt sugars, molasses, a bit of maple, then a bit of coffee bean and lots of really nice dark chocolate flavors, then right back into the delicious bourbon flavors. also some raisony dark fruits. sweet, boozey, and delicious. an amazing tasting beer even though the coffee isnt at the forefront like i imiagined it would be. 
thick, big mouthfeel. boozey, but in a good way. carbonation is just a touch high for the style, but settles out as it warms to a minimal level. silky and smooth.
similar to regular bourbon county, the coffee didnt really jump out at me, but an amazing beer non the less. amazing complexities. bourbon county really is the king of barrel aged stouts IMO. 1,591 charactersdogfishandi, Apr 08, 2012

A - Looks like BCBS! Black as can be, thick, nice finger of brown head with a short life. Head turns into a wisp at the edges after 15 seconds.
S - Dark, deeply roasted coffee beans. Bourbon barrel, charred oak. Some molasses. Bitter dark chocolate. Dark roasted coffee lingers for a while. The bourbon and coffee play beautifully together.
T - This beer is beautiful. From the opening molasses sweetness to the fresh coffee bean flavor that transitions to charred oak, to the bittering dark chocolate, finally working into perhaps my favorite finish out of any beer. The bourbon and the chocolate in the finish are as beautiful as ever, just working perfectly together, as those flavors tend to do. That finish is further enhanced by the amazing coffee beans used in this recipe, as they lend an inviting warmth that is hedged by some bitterness. The alcohol is barely noticeable, and the only fault I can think of is that the alcohol becomes more pronounced as the beer warms.
M - Full bodied, smooth, a touch of alcohol. No carbonation. The body is almost like that of a schnapps, with sugar filling it out, smoothing it, and weighing it down, and alcohol heating it up a bit.
O - Overall a brilliant beer. An improvement over one of my absolute favorites (BCBS), and a beer that simply must be sampled. You need to drink this beer fresh. I had a 1 year old bottle a month ago and it was not even close to this beer. It was still fantastic, but tasted more like standard BCBS, but a but worse because the coffee had a stale character to it. This beer, consumed fresh, is one of my all time favorites and a must-have. I will be searching for it at every future release. 1,770 charactersgreenmonstah, Apr 06, 2012

Thanks to the following...Readbaron for the bottle, Spicelab for bring it back and supplying the bottle. 
A-- Poured dark cola and settled black. A few gurgles of head here and there but otherwise just some ordinary bubbles that made up a thin collar. 
S-- Oak, vanilla, bourbon and soft coffee. Not as big as CBS had. Very sweet nose. Alcohol very present.
T-- Devoured by sweetness and barrel. Waves of sugar just eat this up. More like diabetes on a barrel. 
M-- Full, rich and low carbonation. Where is my insulin shot?? Just way above the top in sugar. Coffee is secondary as the sugar just attacks this beer and makes it overly sweet. Alcohol is quite obvious. 
O-- Tough to drink and enjoy unless have had several beers already. Just a task to drink and overly massive for the sake of being massive. Will avoid the base beer when possible as too sweet for me. 900 charactersmulder1010, Apr 02, 2012

A: Pours pitch black. Faint line of dark mocha head. Forms a ring around the edges. Reddish hues there as well. The typical BCBS look on this one. Oil slick look as you swirl it.
S: Dark mocha. Dark bitter chocolate Vanilla. Oak. Char. Not as much coffee as I was expecting from the fresh batch of this one. It's there but the other notes are more pronounced.
T: I get tons of dark chocolate. The vanilla and oak are there but the coffee isn't as pronounced as I was expecting. Bitter chocolate on the back end. Those ever present BCBS flavors of caramel and toffee hint you as well.
M: Full mouthfeel. Syrupy and silky at the same time.

Poured into a snifter. Pours with high viscosity, appears extremely dark brown, head formation is absent.
S: huge enormous sweetness of vanilla and oak/bourbon. Coffee is rather subtle and there's a mild note of dark fruits. Alcohol is definitely present with a sharp burn.
T: coffee is slight in the taste as well. Brown sugar and molasses is enormous along with a rich chocolate character. Bourbon and oak also adds into the sweetness. Alcohol again makes itself known, but its not overwhelming by any means. Strong vanilla finishes this fantastic brew off creating more balance and complexity.
Overall, this is just another damn good beer by GI. Despite its name, coffee was rather mild possibly due to the aging as the GI brewers recommend to consume this one fresh. It is a very heavy beer but the drinkability is ridiculously high. Definitely deserves the hype. 917 characterstut2528, Apr 01, 2012

A: Pretty standard big bourbon stout look. Carbonation is definitely low, no head, slight mocha wisp along the top. Has the usual bourbon county oil slick along the glassware.
S: Huge roasty coffee notes over layers of vanilla covered oak. As rich as any beer I've ever smelled. Toasted malts, sweet vanilla, and loads of oakiness make this a sweet luscious treat. Bourbon shows itself in a profound way but still plays nice in this beer, letting other aromas grab your attention. 
T: No surprises here, oakey vanilla and smooth coffee lead the front. Sweet-smooth bourbon, light molasses and rich dark chocolate come in right afterwards. Most coffee beers seem to get bitter or grainy but the spirits and richness really contain that aspect. No real hints of alcohol(taste-wise anyway).
M: Sticky sweet. Real smooth with very little notable carbonation.
O: A big beast of a beer that very well deserves it's high regard. Not something I could have very often but this is a beer to rock your socks off once in a while. Not much else I can say about this beer that hasn't already been said. Get you some! 1,164 charactersschwaeh, Mar 31, 2012

T:Coffee, bourbon, enlightenment, nirvana.
M: Nice and heavy, really coats the palate. Low carbonation which I personally enjoy.
Overall: This beer is the physically/palpable manifestation of that feeling you had when you were young. As you ran down the hallway/stairs/whatever and the gifts under the christmas tree came into sight. The elation that followed this moment in time, is the Bourbon County Coffee Stout.

A - Poured about a one finger head but quickly fell to almost nothing. Head is a slightly orange but really light tan color. Body is black with reddish-brown when held to the light at about 5mm. Almost no lacing.
S - Coffee obviously comes to mind, but there are also some dark fruits. Maybe some mollases as well. Definite brown sugar. There is a peppery like note as well, some kick to it. 
T - Just a well balanced beer between the sweet caramel, coffee and slight bitterness, and even that hint of spicy pepper. 
M - Great body to it with some average carbonation which fits this beer just right. It sticks in the mouth for quite a bit after you swallow and starts to sting the back of your tongue like a pepper would. 
O - A very good beer that hits what it is aiming at. Everyone really enjoyed this, but I would put it right up there with the Vanilla. Awesome. 1,012 charactersRuckusDu, Mar 26, 2012
4.97/5  rDev +8.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured from a 650ml bottle...
Appearance: Pours a pitch black body with a coffee tan head that dissipates quite fast. Alcohol riddles the walls of the glass; but overall, minor lacing.
Smell: Bourbon alcohol comes through aside coffee, oak, and even chocolate, vanilla, and toffee subtleties push forth.
Taste: Alcohol bites at first taste quickly being subdued by the onslaught of delicious offerings in this complex brew. Quickly after... vanilla smoothness embodies with elements of the barrel wood, chocolate, and sweet caramel / toffee tones entwined with the perfectly balanced presence of coffee bean.
Mouthfeel: Alcohol is quite sharp at first but almost immediately the carbonation finishes it off with a clean silky smooth palate-feel to culminate this brew.
Overall: Exceptional. I can now see why I had to put so much effort into obtaining a bottle of this stuff. It masks the 14% ABV so quickly -- not to mention, the aftertaste is so loaded with flavor you'll be licking your lips for each and every sip. 1,023 charactersForb, Mar 26, 2012

2010 vintage consumed in March 2012.
Poured into a Trappistes Rochefort chalice (just happened to be my glass of choice for the evening). Oily dark brown-black, small mocha head that dissipated mostly and settled as a thin wispy layer of bubbles; no real lacing, but it did leave an oily film on the glass. I wanted to drink this beer as soon as I got it for fear that the coffee had faded since 2010...it had mostly, but there were still some subtle remnants. Aroma was much like the regular BCBS, bourbon, rich dark malts, semi-sweet chocolate, coffee pretty much lost in the mix. Taste was bourbon heavy up front, alcohol-soaked oak, notes of vanilla, brown sugar, hazelnut, very light coffee roastiness detectable, but surely not as heavy as when the beer was first bottled, I'd imagine. I actually got more coffee in the regular BCBS. Smooth and silky mouthfeel, not quite full bodied, and actually seemed to thin out a bit when it warmed, but that might have just been me getting numb from the booze. Overall very good.
'12 vintage consumed fresh.
 So now that I've had this fresh, I think the coffee is actually way too intense. If you REALLY like your coffee, then you'll like this. But for me, it's just too much. I'd like to drink it when it's at a delicate balance between fresh and 2 years old. In the end, I prefer regular BCBS: it's smoother and the bourbon is more dominant. But as this is specifically the coffee version, it obviously pulls off what it set out to accomplish.
For me, personally, I think this beer hits its sweet spot when it's about 5-7 months old (that is, after it has hit the shelves)...just enough time for the coffee to mellow out, but not fade away. 1,730 charactersRifugium, Mar 24, 2012

Pours brown. Pitch black in glass with a 1cm khaki head. Low retention and spotty lacing  
Very deep, rich and complex nose  very bold and robust coffee. Deep dark chocolate. Bourbon with a touch of oak and mild dark fruit. 
Being aged for two years I think the coffee flavor has faded quite a bit I'm sure. Nevertheless it's still tastes phenomenal. Big, rich, deep,  dark complex flavor with great bourbon, mild espresso, vanilla and a touch of oak. Amazing. 
Full bodied mouth. A touch dry. With low carbonation. 
Overall whether this beer is fresh or aged, it's simply virtually a perfect imperial stout. Big, bold, complex on all levels. Fantastic! 676 charactersMrVonzipper, Mar 24, 2012

4.62/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I cracked my first Bourbon County Coffee of the year with a couple of friends last night. 
There is nothing that I can really add to the reviews that have been posted on the subject of A/S/T/M/O honestly. This is a no hype beer.
But the one useful thing I can point out is the shared experience of this beer from last night, as all three of us drinking it had pretty much precisely the same response.
Opening the beer, you got the bourbon smell immediately. 
And it's as good as it gets.
Tasting from pint glasses just after the foam starts to fade a bit, we got next to zero coffee, and all three of us looked at a neighboring bottle that we decided not to open (a more common and fabulous Ohio BA Imperial Stout) and intimated that we really "like this beer, but that [other beer] is better."
We proceeded to begin our non-beer related work for the evening, and set our glasses down to sip slowly over the next 10 to 15 minutes.
We were all shocked at the transformation this beer went through in that time. I'd have called the beer a solid 3.8-4.0 within a minute after the pour, but 10 minutes later, the aromas had really opened up, and the flavor seemed to explode. Enormous, but utterly refined. PLENTY of coffee. We're Chicago area coffee snobs... Intelligentsia is ubiquitous to the area, and we're very familiar with the flavors they tend toward. We were disappointed at first, and in love with this beer minutes later.
I can only presume that the carbonation of the beer was preventing us from picking up on all of the flavors at first. I can't recommend this highly enough... when you open a bottle of this beer, if you don't have more of it for later... if this is your bottle for the year... take it slowly, or even let it sit. We're looking at a B to B+ level beer that turned into a no brainer A+.
I don't like to use 5.0's on this site. The quality of this beer makes it hard to resist. I have 2 more bottles, which I am going to age for 1 and 2 years respectively (I just "have to know" if the coffee goes away entirely, or if it "ages well" as the label says.) 
This is one of the finest beers you could ever buy in a regular retail environment. Drink it and be happy. 2,196 charactersTapeDeck, Mar 22, 2012

A - Very dark body from a very dark pour with a head of dark brown with very large bubbles and a very quick dissipation. Seems like not a good sign, this glass is as clean as they get.
S - My, this is heavenly! A dark roasty, bourbony, coffee-y, chocolatey, vanilla-y, toffee-y thing. It's really fantastic. A touch of some dark fruitiness as well.
T - A giant sweet chocolatey bourbon flavor with some coffee as a subtle undertone. THis is really bleepin tasty. The coffee is subtle, maybe because it fades that fast, or maybe because it's just kind of subtle anyway. Can't tell, but aside from the booziness, this is a very pleasant, very well balanced thing.
M - smooth as heck, thick as heck. The slightest bit astringent. Very good.
O - a great beer. Just very well done all around. Wish the carbonation looked better. 844 charactersColdPoncho, Mar 20, 2012

Pours a dark near black, coating the class with sticky brown liquid, hard pour brings a cap of dense brown froth, gone quickly. Scent kicks off with a cup of dark roasted coffee, more brewed than bean, solid notes of vanilla combine with semi sweet baking chocolate, solid notes of whiskey and bourbon, some oak, coconut and dark fruit to boot, nicely layered scent but needs to be a bit more aggressive. Taste brings an initial hit of vanilla, sugar and cream before the dark roasted coffee and semi-sweet chocolate hit, strong whiskey and bourbon notes almost take over the palate, but beer smooths into a well layered and blended drink with additional notes of dark fruit, oak and coconut. Full bodied, not as dense despite the stickyness of the beer, lingering sweetness and booze. Overall, quite impressed with the well layered and blended notes, quie concerned that drinking so fresh would cause the bourbon to overpower, but that wasnt the case. 969 charactersrfgetz, Mar 12, 2012

Tons of chocolate and coffee flavors, deep and complex like the most beautiful, artisan coffee. That's all, but great!

A: Same as any bourbon county stout. Pitch black with a tan head that rapidly recedes to nothing.
S: Coffee dominates the smell. Behind this are warm, sweet scents and raisins. There is a bit of oak and some alcohol heat.
T: Starts with an explosion of brewed coffee flavor. Quickly dozens of other flavors assert themselves. The bourbon barrels add a little bit of boozy bourbon but smoky oak is more prominent. The sweet side of the beer comes through with raisins, figs, brown sugar and molasses. There is mild alcohol heat, especially in the finish, but it's not too hot.
M: Thick, full-bodied and a little bit sticky. Mild carbonation.
O: An amazing beer. The coffee flavor is fantastic and distinct enough that I can actually appreciate the nuances of the beans. All the flavors meld perfectly. Quite possibly my favorite beer. 879 charactersWankelEngine, Mar 08, 2012

Pours a pitch black in color w/ a 1/2 finger tan head that dissipates to an outer ring of tan, leaves light lacing. Aromas of chocolate, peat, espresso, light oak, and light bourbon. The flavor started out w/ sweet chocolate and molasses up front, leading into espresso and peat, and finished w/ mild oak and bourbon. Full bodied and lush w/ appropriate carbonation. For 14% ABV, this is as drinkable as it gets!
Overall, awesome brew! 1st time I have sampled this brew, and now you can count me in on the hype train.
I remember having regular 2008 BCS fresh and I was not a big fan. Goose Island must have tweaked and perfected their recipe over the next 3 years, because I recently had a 2011 BCS and now this and they both floored me. 829 charactersmikeyv35, Mar 07, 2012

Coffee, vanilla, brown sugar, bourbon aroma. Chocolate, wood, molasses. A hit of fumy alcohol at the back of the nose.
Surprisingly unboozy despite a good dose of bourbon. Vanilla and lots of fresh roasty coffee flavor. Decent barrel presence. Subtle trace of anise/black licorice. Very rich, heavy and sweet, just short of cloyingly so. Really delicious.
Chewy and sticky but not totally viscous. Medium-full bodied. Low but present carbonation. Overall a smooth and creamy mouthfeel.
Definitely up there with the best stouts and coffee beers, if not the best going. I felt everything was pretty well integrated, and the coffee, roast, bourbon, vanilla, oakiness, toffee and booze hung together beautifully. 807 characterstobelerone, Mar 06, 2012

Poured into a brandy snifter.
Viscous and dark, but surprisingly with no head even with an aggressive pour. Coats the glass completely and even stains it if left out too long. Alcoholic legs are very visible as well.
Predominantly the Anjilanaka coffee beans on the nose. Little bits of the original BCBS character, like the oak, vanilla tannins and caramel, are discernible after deeper whiffs. Good amount of bourbon presence as well. After taste is exactly like drinking coffee. Not too boozy overall. 
Opens with black coffee bitterness, toasted malt and caramel. Slim amounts of vanilla and syrupy sweetness. Bourbon heat and burnt coffee beans finish off the profile. Thick, full mouthfeel.
Glad to have finally tried this elusive personal whale of mine. But I was surprised to find that the coffee wasn't more of an incorporation into the BCBS, but rather, almost like a masking of it. The amount of coffee was way more than I had expected. Kinda wished it didn't overtake the beauty of BCBS. I think some age on this year's bottles would definitely help mellow things out a bit more. 1,158 charactersinfi, Mar 04, 2012

A: Pours deep black with a half-finger beige head that quickly dissipates into a foam ring that borders the inside of the glass
S: Strong aroma of bourbon, oak, and coffee with just a hint of roasted malt.
T: Opens with a strong salvo of bourbon and espresso that carries through to a warm bourbon finish
M: Low carbonation, silky syrup consistency that coats the mouth. As with all BCBS variants the warmth from abundant alcohol is ever present.
O: I had previously had this brew from a bottle and still have a few in the cellar, but the draft is even better. The coffee is a bit too forward for me from the bottle, while on draft it becomes an essential component that complements the other characteristics of this stout. Truly fantastic! 814 characterschanokokoro, Mar 04, 2012

A: Pours black as night with practically no head. Looks like a black hole. Awesome.
S: Coffee coffee coffee. Rich dark roasted coffee that has possibly the freshest aroma I've come across in a beer (tends to smell stale, not here though!). Barrel and chocolate in the background. Unbelievable I don't get any alcohol. For a 14% barrel aged beer, that scares me.
T: Coffee bomb back by a seemingly mellowed out BCBS. Fresh dark roasted coffee grounds soaked in bourbon poured over chocolate fudge cake followed by a shot of fine port is the best description I can think of. Again, there is no alcohol anywhere. Perhaps not the best balanced coffee stout as the coffee just jumps out of the glass, it's definitely the most powerful kick of coffee I've encountered in a beer. Think of the biggest coffee, chocolate, and bourbon flavors you can think of in BCBS and it's still bigger than that, and without the alcohol of fresh BCBS.
M: About as thick as it gets, light carbonation. Extremely smooth, coats the palate, velvety, rich, exquisit.
O: I love BCBS with a little age on it and this just takes it to a whole 'nother level. This is easily the best coffee stout/beer I've ever had and definitely one of the best beers I've ever consumed. I'm glad I've got one more in my cellar. I can't wait to try the Vanilla and Rare. 1,371 charactersSatchboogie, Mar 04, 2012
4.15/5  rDev -9.4%look: 2.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 42011 vintage. Poured into a snifter.
Pours deep brown, almost black. No head or lacing to speak of. Looks much like a flat pour of cola.
Aroma is spectacular. Potent smell of oak and booze; more of the barrel than you get out of regular Bourbon County. A lot of warming booze is present in the aroma as well. There is a warmth and depth here that is just wonderful.
Taste is quite nice. This brew is relatively young in its lifespan; drinking it this young I was hoping to maximize the coffee flavor. Alas, it was subdued. However, there was plenty of warm bourbon, with chocolatey accompaniment, to satisfy. The desired bitter coffee aftertaste never showed up.
Mouthfeel is thick and syrupy as expected. 
Overall, a nice brew that is not quite worthy of the asking price or demand. You'd be much better off with a couple more regular Bourbon County stouts- more bang for your buck. Especially if you want the bourbon flavor to dominate. 943 charactersstonermouse, Mar 04, 2012

I've passed on getting this in the past and have been looking forward to trying it fresh. 1/11/12 bottle. Poured into a Darkness snifter about 20 minutes after being removed from the fridge.
A - Looks a lot like the other BCBS beers. Very dark, a thin-medium brown head shows up and fizzes away in 10 seconds. Sticks to the glass well, but the head returns less than in the regular version. Minimal lacing remains for a bit on the second pour.
S - Sweet coffee, fudge, a little bit of oak coming out. However, the sweet coffee/fudge/chocolate really dominates. 
T - Coffee, fudge, vanilla, oak and some heat in the finish. The sweet coffee really takes over the first half of the flavor. I probably wouldn't guess it was a BCBS variant until twards the end of the flavor when the fudge/vanilla/oak kick in. The coffee returns for the finish.
M - Oh, BCBS and the variants. A slightly thicker medium mouthfeel with slight but prickly carbonation. Not all that thick on the tongue. It does stick to the month though after each sip.
O - The appearance and mouthfeel are what keeps this one down. The flavor is actually reminiscent of BA DL, but with a lot more coffee. Great beer overall. Somewhere between a 4.0 and 4.5 overall, but I gave a 4.5 1,287 charactersclaaark13, Mar 03, 2012

Poured from 650ml bottle (bottle label reads that this can be developed over 5 years) into a snifter glass. Pours black with a very thin dark brown head that disappears very quickly. There is almost zero lacing throughout. Nose picks up 100% coffee grind, faint oak, and some bourbon. Flavor consists of strong coffee which would have been a coffee drinker’s paradise and the bourbon is extremely well-hidden. Dangerously drinkable at 14% ABV! Mouthfeel is thin with some boozy back finish towards the end as the beer began to warm up. But, wow did the beer become it’s absolute best and finest when it hit 50-55 degrees!?

A- Pours oily and opaque with cola-colored tinged ring. 1/4 finger cappuccino head fades quickly, leaving a faint ring of lacing which disappears quickly.
S- Robust hazlenut and rich coffee dominate in the truest sense of the word. Imagine the most purely pulled shot of fresh espresso combined with rich dutch chocolate.Notes of bourbon, soy sauce, and dry cocoa drift about the aroma behind the leading notes. 
T- Fresh roasted coffee leads, followed by fudge notes and tailing off with bourbon. There's no real bitterness to speak of, aside from that which is lightly suggested by the coffee. A light numbing bourbon sensation and a roasted nuttiness accompany a sweet sticky finish.
M- Inexplicably creamy and chewy, it's impossible to imagine a more perfect mouthfeel for a stout. Finish is sticky and lingering, evolving from bourbon through coffee, ending in powdered cocoa and mild numbing alcolhol.
O- Even fresh, this stout is the pinnacle of rich coffee taste, sweet cocoa, and just enough bourbon. Infallible. Legendary. Perfect. 1,140 charactersgigaknight, Mar 01, 2012

*From notes
-- Vintage 2011 --
A: If you've seen any BCBS variant, then you know what this looks like. Dark and heavy brownish-black. A good pour yields a dense .5 finger head that's quite creamy, though it fades rather fast. A thin tarnish collar remains.
S: Bold, heavy and earth-forward dark roast. It's fresh as can be, which is immediately evident in the bouquet. As it warms, hints of nuttiness and a pinch of ginger creep into the far depths of my nostrils.
T: Again, big and bold coffee is everywhere. It's almost too much at first. As I let it sit, warm and open up a bit, I get a bit of boozy bourbon on the mid. The finish is a bit like overly toasted coffee beans. Again, let this warm and decant a bit, as it really does need time to find it's balance.
M: Creamy and dense. Not quite up to the level of the standard BCBS, but none the less it feels ten times better then most all the other RIS/ADIS beers on them market.
O: What an intense ride. When Goose Island says this is a coffee stout, it's literally like a coffee/ADIS hybrid. If you don't like your coffee black and full of liquor, stay far, far away.
In the end, BCBCS is a very good take on what has become my favorite beer. Is it as good as regular BCBS? No, but it's damn fine in it's own right and certainly a worthy tick. 1,357 charactersRhettroactive, Mar 01, 2012

smooth, creamy, and thick with a little carbonation that is a bit prickly and a lot of heat on the finish.
Definitely a slight step up from the original, but still a bit bourbon heavy. I wonder if aging would diminish both the coffee and bourbon flavors or meld them together more seemlessly. I think I'll age the other bottle to see. 829 characterssilentjay, Feb 28, 2012

4.56/5  rDev -0.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75A month old bottle poured into a DFH snifter.
A- Black with slight ruby around the edges when held to light. Barely any head to speak of. Even when you try to aggressively agitate it, no foam can be produced.
S- starts with harsh bourbon with slight presence of coffee grounds. Moves to chocolate and roast and then sweet sherry alcohol with dark cherries.
T/M- At first it starts out similar to the nose with big bourbon smoothed out with underlying notes of fresh, robust, and smooth coffee grinds and a touch of silky dark chocolate. Surprises me a little since you expect coffee to really shine, but true to BCS it's mostly bourbon. As it warms further RIS flavors come out in the taste- dark cherry, figs, rum soaked raisins, sherry alcohol. Char and smoke are present after awhile, as well as vanilla and a bit of oak. Bitter chocolate and smooth coffee grounds seem to dominate as it nears the end.
O- Big RIS flavors as it opens up. Coffee really just plays a very nice back up role to these. sherry alcohol hogs the nose in the end. There is a warming presence on the gullet throughout. This thing is an absolute beast and a sipper. Much different that KBS where Coffee is really the star player, the bourbon in BCBCS won't be denied the spotlight. I like how complex the flavors are and how there are a lot of RIS notes still able to shine through the onslaught of bourbon heat with chocolate and coffee underneath.
Tried a year old KBS immediately after and it felt numb to my palate. Tried one again the next day and it still didn't stand up to what I remembered...either the BCBCS is waaaay more bold or I need to drink KBS fresh all the time- I think probably both are somewhat true, but the latter more so. 1,726 characterssentomaster, Feb 27, 2012

Score: 97
"2011" vintage bottle (it was actually released in February 2012) served in god-knows-what-you-call-this glass (a footed pilsner glass? a water glass?) and enjoyed on 02/25/12 at Rock's in Lakeview.
Appearance: Black as night, vacuum of light. Totally opaque. Pours a pencil thin tan ring of head around the glass. A vigorous swirl creates a pattern of milk chocolate chocolate head that covers maybe 1/3 of the top of the beer and which quickly disappears after you stop swirling. Oily lacing with no retention. This is stout is heavy and imposing in appearance. 4/5
Smell: Rich dark chocolate, faint coffee and dark fruit. Raisin, smooth vanilla, mellow bourbon, and sweet milk chocolate. There is a very faint black licorice/anise aroma in the nose too. Very rich and balanced aroma. 4.75/5
Taste: Super rich chocolate and sweet bourbon soaked raisins throughout. Not a whole lot of coffee upfront, but there is plenty of lingering, smooth and unacidic roasty coffee and creamy espresso toward the end and in the finish. Mellow bourbon, sweet molasses, and dark fruit on midpalate. Hints of oak and a little black licorice at points. As this beer layers and warms, a bourbon soaked raisin flavor grows in the otherwise smooth coffee finish. Very rich and complex. Tastes a lot like the regular Bourbon County Brand Stout, but with a delectable coffee twist. Yum! 4.5/5
Mouthfeel: Full bodied, virtually no carbonation. Sweet and slightly savory finish. Syrupy mouthfeel. 5/5
Overall: Just as tasty as the Bourbon County Brand Stout, but with a delectable coffee twist. The 2010 vintage was much more coffee forward, but the 2011 vintage is still an improvement over regular Bourbon County.
Recommendations: It is hard to find a bottle of this stuff outside of restaurants right now, but this is a brew absolutely worth seeking out. Just make sure to bring a friend to split the bottle with you, because at 13+% ABV and 400-500 calories per 12 oz, you won't want to drink the whole 22 oz by yourself!
Pairings: French vanilla ice cream.
Cost: $26 for a 22 oz (bomber) bottle at the bar, $15.99 in stores. 2,209 charactersjegross2, Feb 26, 2012

A - Beer is thick, oily, and dark. Small mocha head quickly dissipated. No lacing. Exactly what I'd expect from this beer. 
S - Huge coffee aroma. I don't even drink coffee personally but man, if coffee smelled this way I might just have to try it. Some vanilla, barrel and booze also present.
T - Huge, bold flavors. Very sweet mix of coffee and vanilla balanced with barrel goodness. Malty caramel with hints of ... is that soy? Extremely dark and satisfying. 
M - thick and heavy. Little carbonation. This feels like a substantial beer.
O - Lived up to the hype for me. All-around solid coffee stout - huge flavor, a little heavy but of course it's going to be heavy! 752 charactersbpk59, Feb 26, 2012

Pitch black with no head. No real visible carbonation. 
Coffee. Fresh Ground coffee. It's like sticking your nose in some fresh ground coffee that smells amazing, and in fact actually does. 
Strong coffee taste dominates. Not much bourbon. Little buttery vanilla taste too. Just a wonderful coffee taste. Would love to get my hands on some of this coffee from Intelligentsia. 
Medium to full bodied with an appropriate carbonation level. Alcohol is absolutely nowhere to be found. 
Great beer. I suppose some bourbon would be nice in there but I'm not complaining. Get this while it's fresh! 669 charactershansgruber, Feb 22, 2012

The aroma is of freshing ground coffee beans and vanilla, thus a french vanilla coffee scent. Beautiful caramel and bourbon aroma. When cold, it smells very boozy but as it warms, it really breaks out. Roasted barley and chocolate round out the aroma.
The taste is more similar to the base bourbon county stout. Bourbon, vanilla, and caramel really stand out. The roast and coffee play a secondary role. Perhaps not as sweet as the base BCS, but still very sweet. There seems to be a fruity flavor as well.
Full bodied with soft carbonation. Very sweet on the palate and it finishes sticky and syrupy. It is incrediably smooth and the ABV is somewhat balanced out.
Very good stout but I must say I am a bit disappointed. I was expecting much more coffee flavor. This seems to be much closer to the base beer than the other variations. Definitely had other porters or stouts with more coffee flavor. 999 charactersGmann, Feb 20, 2012

A - Pitch black viscous body with a dark mocha head. Fades quickly to some very light edging. Alcoholic legs with minimal lacing. Looks identical to standard BCBS.
S - Very different from the other coffee stouts I've tried. It starts off initially with a huge coffee presence, but its very savory and spicy rather than sweet. There is notes of black pepper, leather, licorice, and soy. The finish is burnt oak and light vanilla.
T - Much sweeter than the nose. This is one of the best coffee beers I have ever tried. I don't even think I've even had coffee that has tasted this good. Very very dark roasted espresso beans laced with vanilla, coconut, cocoa powder and charred oak. The finish is smooth with bourbon and lightly bitter beans. Phenomenal, one of the best tasting stouts I have tasted. Mouth feel is silky smooth and the viscous body coats the mouth evenly. 14% abv is not noticeable at all. 
O - This doesn't beat out the base beer for me. I absolutely love the complexity that is BCBS, and I think adding coffee takes away from that experience a bit. Its integrated really well, but its just too much happening at once. However, this is the best coffee beer I have ever tasted. The flavors are just so intense and world class. A near perfect stout.
2012 Release - Intelligentsia La Tortuga Beans. 22 oz bomber bottled on 11/12/2012, #2156. Poured into a GI wine glass. Quick notes as I went in depth on the 2011. Reviewed 01/07/2012.
A - Identical to the 2011. Pitch black with a quick fading mocha head. Great alcoholic legs.
S - Just as savory as the 2011. Bitter espresso, soy sauce, chocolate fudge, and butterscotch. 
T - Massive notes of coffee beans play off of the phenomenal chocolate and buttery bourbon base beer. Spot on mouth feel.
O - I remember liking the 2011 version a notch better. Still, this beer is excellent. Light espresso notes then lead into the symphony that is BCBS. Love it! 2,066 charactersdavey101, Feb 20, 2012

A - Pours pitch black with 1/2 finger mocha colored head with aggressive pour. Head fades quickly. Oily lacing.
S - Black licorice, charred oak, bourbon, espresso coffee.
T - Espresso coffee and black licorice hits me right up front with the bourbon making its appearance shortly after. Waves of black anise and charred oat come through as well and the finish is smooth with a slightly bitter ending. 
M - Full bodied and oily. A bit low on carbonation.
O - Very good beer with the addition of the coffee. I may have been a tad underwhelmed by this because my expectations were so high. A great beer for the barrel aged stout lover. I may have a hard time finishing this bottle myself but will give it a college try! 825 characterspigc, Feb 20, 2012

A - Beer pours with motor oil darkness; viscous in appearance, but rather thin in body when you try it; no head formed at all; whatever carbonation/bubbles there was to this beer dissolved rather quickly; less than half finger in size head; no lacing
S - Dark coffee; burnt-burnt coffee beans; espresso smell; touch of red grape; cherry; no hops or any citrus hop scents; high octane coffee nose
T - Deep, deep coffee bean flavor; malt taste is of burnt coffee beans with a touch of brown sugar sweetness; besides a couple of other faint flavor characteristics, this is all dark coffee
M - Consistency is medium-to-thick body; leaves behind a deep lingering coffee flavor with a touch of sweetness
D - Great drink; not for the faint of heart, but for those willing to expand their drinking horizons and finish off a meal with a espresso and beer mixed into one delectable drink 934 charactersferrari29, Feb 20, 2012
4.68/5  rDev +2.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Pours a deep opaque black with a small coffee head fading almost immediately.
Smells of rich bourbon, oak, leather with a little coffee peaking in as well.
Taste is similar to the nose. Big bourbon sweetness upfront with the oak and leather, but perfectly balanced with some bitter coffee on the back end.
Thick oily mouthfeel, but the coffee keeps the sweetness at bay making it wonderfully balanced.
Wonderful beer and glad they released it again. The coffee serves as the perfect foil for the bourbony sweetness making it well balanced and easy drinking. 561 charactersjmarsh123, Feb 19, 2012

S: The smell is incredible. Bourbon, Coffee, Chocolate, alcohol it takes many sniffs to process it all. 
T: The taste matches up exactly with the smell. First you get bourbon and alcohol and then the coffee comes through and finally the chocolate. It is unbelievably complex, it took my brain a while to sort everything out. It tastes like 12 different things are going on all at once but are perfectly balanced. 
M: Silky and smooth with an incredible alcohol burn. 
O: This stuff is incredible. It's a shame its so rare and only available once a year, but on the other hand maybe its a good thing. After drinking it I could probably go a year before I have it again. It's so decadent and complex I couldn't have it all the time. 813 charactersJplachy, Feb 19, 2012

Black pour with no head or lace. Incredible aroma of fresh coffee, sweet bourbon, roasty malts, and fermentable sugars. Molasses-y. Nothing shy of outstanding!
Tons of fresh coffee, sweet malts, and boozy warmth blend perfectly here. Regular BCS tends to be hot when fresh, but I could seriously finish this entire bomber myself. Flavor profile is balanced exceptionally well. I could drink this all day.
Mouthfeel needs work: an oily, slightly-thicker-than-medium body is simply not enough for this brew. And -- as stated -- it's dangerously drinkable.
Props to GI for crafting yet another world-class beer. Seek this one out; you won't regret it. 707 charactersbrystmar, Feb 17, 2012

A: Pours like liquid coal and after initial fizziness, it settles into the glass, glossy and headless like a pool of dried magma. Legs are as good as any Burgundy.
S: Rich and instantly intoxicating. The base beer comes through with carmelized vanilla beans, dark chocolate, white chocolate, and raisons. The barrel adds more vanilla, charcoal, and oaky complexity. Finally, the coffee peeks through this cornucopia of flavours and presents a full cup of cold-steep, rich coffee, with two creams and one sugar.
T: Explodes on the palate. Barrel flavours meld with the rich cocoa and vanilla. Smooth oak plays against the dark fruits perfectly. Coffee is more present here and provides delicious extra tannic complexity. Caramel and sweetened chocolate are big, but the dry roastiness of the wood and coffee balance it perfectly and leave a tingling sensation of gustatory conflict and resolution in the aftertaste. Beautiful.
D: Supurbly drinkable. Even while savouring every drop of this, I am still drinking it far too fast. I drank about half the bottle and shared the rest with my girlfriend. I didn't taste a bit of the 14%, but I sure felt it when I stood up. It is warming and smooth, but remarkably drinkable. Mouthfeel is full and creamy, like a chocolate malt milkshake.
Overall: I didn't think they could top BCBS, but they did it. Amazingly good beer and just one step above BCBS in the complexity department. Buy it whenever you see it and share it with someone dear to you. Outstanding! 1,547 charactersJohnnyChicago, Feb 16, 2012

A - Chilled espresso. Opaquely dark. Not a ton of head. Thick but not as oily as others (even bcbs).
S - Melted hard candy smell. Tons of coffee. Truly incredible. Makes you want to just sit and smell this beer forever. Vanilla and coconut round it out--I find the smell amazing.
T - So good. Unbelievably complex. Vanilla and cotton candy and marshmallows. Coffee in the middle. Fresh coffee and chocolate. Bourbon sweetness enters at the perfect time and hangs out but does not linger.
M - Great mouthfeel. Thick and sticky... it is sweet but not cloyingly so. Medium carbonation and a nice balance.
O - This beer was incredible for me. The smell is definitely the best part. It is also incredibly drinkable for the ABV. I love bcbs and this is just adding an awesome complexity. 829 charactersdlello2, Feb 12, 2012

Pours a dark black with a small dark chocolate colored head. Some coffee oil seems to be present at top of head.
Smell is puncuated by the coffee and bourbon but in a good way.
Flavor also dominated by the coffe and bourbon. Both are smooth with a slight alcohol burn on the finish.

A - Color of black coffee with a slight brown on the edge. It's opaque and very clean looking. No head at all with only a slight amount of foam on top
S - Deep roasted coffee is the main smell with hints of vanilla, bourbon, and oak. A strong nose that you could just smell all day. I have to say I was a bit amazed that this dropped off so quick. While the nose is still strong, the coffee hints were not as strong as the bottle I had last week.
T - Very similar to the nose. The main profile is coffee and delicious coffee at that. Using Intelligentsia really makes a difference. It does have some vanilla and dark chocolate sweetness. There is still a slight bourbon kick but not as much as BCBS as the coffee helps mellow it out. The oak and bourbon linger on the tongue to give a nice spiciness to it.
MF - Has a nice syrup feeling to it. Also had a decent amount of carbonation that helps adds to the bit of the bourbon
O - A great coffee stout and one that must be drank fresh as the coffee drops off surprisingly fast. The coffee does add a nice wrinkle to the beer and mellows out the bourbon a bit. This is one of those beers that is worth seeking out. 1,200 charactersjeonseh, Feb 12, 2012

Pours a jet black with thin tan head. Lacing is pretty minimal for such a big beer. Smell is a great mix of bourbon, coffee, oak and chocolate. Flavor is heavy on the coffee up front, but the bourbon comes on towards the end and combines very nicely with chocolate and oak. It's not nearly as sweet as the regular BCBS. As it warms up the coffee mellows out and blends in with the other flavors better. Mouthfeel is pretty full-bodied and a little bit sticky. Overall, this is a great Bourbon County variant, but I prefer the regular BCBS better. The coffee adds a little bit of acidity to it that disrupts the bourbon/chocolate/oak flavor I love so much. 734 charactersstarrdogg, Feb 11, 2012

A: Dark black, with a thin quarter finger cream colored head. Decent lacing. Light retention.
S: Lots of coffee, chocolate, vanilla, bourbon, and some sweet caramel. The most prominent note, though, is coffee. Smells like a pot of brew. Traces of woodiness. 
T: Chocolate, vanilla, coffee, caramel. Literally tastes like regular BCBS with a generous dose of morning brew. The coffee actually takes a back seat to the regular BCBS flavors. Just loads of chocolate and vanilla.
M: Full bodied, moderately carbed. Flavors are well-balanced.
O: I preferred regular BCBS to this. The coffee is nicely integrated and definitely takes a back seat, but there isn't enough new or interesting in this for me to sing its praises over regular BCBS. It's a great stout, just a victim of its other siblings. 838 characterssiege06nd, Feb 11, 2012

A: The usual motor oil comparison works well here. A thick, inky pour into a pitch-black body with a brown head that fizzles away almost immediately. 
S: Overwhelming coffee. I have never encountered this much coffee nose in a beer. And it's good coffee, too. As a fairly frequent Intelligentsia drinker, I get all the nice notes: some cherry and citrus notes hidden in the fresh, robust coffee bean scent. Smooth, not sweet bourbon finishes out the nose. 
T: This is like drinking thick, cool coffee. Caramel, earth, a touch of fruit, chocolate, and a growing, warming whiskey taste. Just fantastic. Combines three of my favorite things in the flawless way GI continues to render BCS variations. Absolutely owns KBS, and even Dark Lord. Less sweet and sticky than either, and with much better coffee character. 
M: The alcohol is there, but for 14%, damn, this is smooth, easy drinking. Thick, almost flat, but who cares? 
O: Worth the hype, but drink it fresh, before the coffee fades. For now, the really intricate aspects of coffee are still prevalent. It'll be fine in five years, but it'll just be BCS then. 1,174 characterswschmit, Feb 11, 2012

S- Really great coffee aroma. Stands out as ice coffee, but less aromatic more like strong espresso. There is that hint of bourbon there as well. 
T- It has a strong coffee forward flavor and this really pleasantly leads into that bourbon barrel stout. It smooths out the bourbon very nicely, the coffee balancing the bourbon. Some nice vanilla and bitter chocolate accents as well. 
M- Marshmellowy. Yeah like you can chew on it but it isn't too heavy. The carbonation here is really what stands out, keeping it very drinkable for a heavy bold beer. 
O- Really outstanding. I had a very fresh BCBS a while back and it just wasn't ready, or I wasn't. Very different experience with this one. Smooth and sippable. That coffee works wonders as well as this being a bit older. 928 charactersNachojon, Feb 09, 2012
4.86/5  rDev +6.1%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Poured from the bottle into a Dogfish Head snifter glass. Vintage 2011.
Appearance is a perception of really good, and also really disappointing. Off tan brown head, barely forms, has not staying power, fizzy sounding and snaps a lot. Settles down to a very fine collar around the edge of the glass, with a top that has a very large glycerin sheen. Leg action for 14 percent provides some nice coating on the sides of the glass while swirling, but also a filmy top. Body color is a classic dark walnut brown, there might even be some red edges to this as well. That's about the worst of it.
The nose on this, is unreal. On opening, it's milky to dark silky chocolate. When pouring, the scent fills the space. I don't even have to stick my nose in my glass. Further examination the brew brings a great ripping coffee bean warmth without alcohol heat. Rich creamy warmth almost buttery without any alcohol. Coffee roasting forward heat from pipping beans just ripped. Punching on an aggressive pour brings out even some barleywine fruit rich character.
Exceptional on the palate. What a great balance of whiskey barreled, coffee, and stout flavor. Coffee forward takes to meld with a condensed milk sweetness without any syrupy sugar. Caramel bourbon like richness melds, as if it's the sense of salted French caramels melted into my coffee. Rich, dense, tight fizz on this but doesn't take away from palate enjoyment. Not a flat syrupy mess whatsoever. Not so whiskey tasting, but who cares, with a sense of caramel whiskey angle adding to the coffee so perfectly.
This is an incredible example of a coffee marriage of great whiskey barrel accents into a beer. Easily the best coffee stout I have had to date. 1,713 characterssmakawhat, Feb 09, 2012

M-slick but heavy. Minimal carbonation as it should be but it is perfect.
O-this is borderline perfect. The only bad thing is the abv. It tastes phenomenal but I can only have so much but this beer is ecstacy. 594 charactersbeerhan, Feb 08, 2012
4.85/5  rDev +5.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Wow. What a brew. Being a relative novice in the craft beer scene (1.2 years and counting) I sometimes miss certain elements of the beer or don't consider other factors, such as mouthfeel, to be as important because I lack the perception. Well, after drinking this brew, I can say I now know the feeling of a great mouthfeel. I have had bc vanilla, bc regular 11', king henry and now this. Bourbon county coffee blows them all away. The nose is rich with bourbon sweetness, a little heat and some subtle coffee and vanilla notes. I am not blown away by booze from the nose which invites me to take a sip. Now, solely comparing the three I have tried, this is by far the best. Smooth as silk, coats the mouth like the vanilla did, but with a wonderful complexity and relatively easy drinkability. the taste rapidly changes almost as it warms each degree. I get smooth bourbon, nice subtle blend of coffee and chocolate. it is not cloying, rather smooth and luscious. When I swirl it in my mouth, huge coffee notes are unleashed at a ferocious rate. It is big, undoubtedly, but it is everything I could have ever hoped for in a bourbon county. Smooth, drinkable, great mouthfeel and a whole lot of flavor 1,202 charactersjsm1289, Feb 08, 2012

Flat is an understatement ere. This is flat but absurdity thick and moderately cream beer. The sugary body seems to maintain enough to keep this one drinkable from the flat beers like mikkler and the brandy legs keep ti far more than just fun to look at. The black at hell elixir in the glass is certainly interesting but when the base beer gets people to bitch about the lack of head and this is even flatter...well it misses the elite markets. Still the dark syrupy colors and body is world class. 
This one smells of fine bourbon with the vanilla and sweet caramel notes mixed with intense chocolate (milk and bakers) with nice coffee elements.
The taste is much more chocolate and sweet molasses, raisins with vanilla and caramel secondary. This one brings everything from dark bakers chocolate to brownies in together with the only hint of bitterness from the coffee.
Thick syrupy and flat may not work for 99% of beers but this is part of the 1%. A truly elite and amazing brew.
This isn't better than he bourbon country stout, but perfection is hard to replicate. 1,154 charactersbobhits, Feb 07, 2012

The smell is wonderful roasted malt, caramel and coffee. Taste is also great. When still chilled there is more malt with a coffee finish. As it warms the beer sweetens a little and you get more caramel and coffee, vanilla too. Mouthfeel is unusual. Sort of thick but creamy or foamy. More carbonation than I expected. Over all outstanding. 413 charactersKbogac, Feb 07, 2012

A: Pours a jet black with a viscous body and a one finger dark khaki head the dissolves rather quickly to a thin collar. Pretty still body.
S: Crushed coffee beans and raw cocoa fill the nose first and foremost. Digging in a little deeper yields some light bourbon, subtle oak and some vanilla-esque sweetness.
T: The coffee is very upfront (as well it should be) with a mashed, straight from the bag rawness to it. The bourbon barrel starts to peak through around mid-palate and it leads into a blend of milk chocolate and roasted malts. The finish is a sweet mix of caramel and vanilla. The ABV is basically non-existent.
M: Heavy bodied, but velvety and smooth the whole way through. The carbonation is medium to low and it sticks across your whole palate with a mocha like sweetness. The slightest bit of warming comes through at the backend, but this ABV is just so well hidden.
O: Delicious. While I thought the nose wasn't up to what I wanted it at the taste more than made up for what the nose lacked. Wave after wave of flavor is so well layered in this beer, and the steps the taste takes you on are great. Nothing dominated in the flavors, just a very well balanced beer. The ABV is hidden so well it's insane. Chalk up another winner for the GI barrel program. 1,356 charactersTreebs, Feb 06, 2012

Nose still has that super rich, gooey chocolate brownie found in Rare and the better BCBS batches. Fresh roasted coffee beans, a pleasant and well integrated bourbon character. Mouth is sweet, more bourbon forward than the others I believe, roasted coffee on the finish. Hot on the finish. Too much residual sugar in this, which is weird because I believe this is the same base batch as the amazing '11 BCBS which was super well integrated and not overly sweet at all. Nice, solid barrel aged stout, but not in the same league as the '11 BCBS or Rare. 646 charactersJAXSON, Feb 06, 2012

Couldn't wait to finally get to try this.
A: Pours a dark motor oil black with a thin brown head. Little to no lacing.
S: strong chocolate, cherry and bourbon notes. Also really pick up the fresh intelligentsia coffee beans and vanilla.
T: Quite the medley of flavors going on in this one. The coffee is prominent up front. The coffee is followed by dark chocolate, bourbon and cherry and vanilla. The bourbon is inherently present but not overwhelming. Just an all around incredibly balanced beer.
M: Full bodied. Smooth is the key word on this. For 14% abv and less than a month old that is something to be applauded.
O: Overall just wow, truly a remarkable beer. 712 charactersjdhende, Feb 05, 2012

One of the most rich noses I've ever smelled. Layers of bourbon, and fresh coffee with hints of cinnamon and a hint of foresty plant material. 
Every drink you take gives you something a litte different. There is no mistaking the bourbon barrels, oak and whiskey are prevalant throughtout, but lush dark coffee pops in in the midpalate break things up a little. Also a good dose of dark chocolate. Coffee is also what I'm getting on the aftertaste. 
Mouthfeel is thick and creamy, the consistency of heavy cream really. Very low carbonation is right for the style. A beer not for beginners and one (at 14% abv) that you should definitely split with a friend, but another outstanding Bourbon County Stout from Goose Island. 875 charactersNStLincoln, Feb 05, 2012

Seems like I get a new aroma each time I go back for a smell. The first notes are strong with chocolate and bourbon. Later, I get vanilla, cherry, and licorice. Finally, faint notes of roasted malt and coffee.
The flavor is equally complex, rich, and dense. The chocolate notes are strong up front with the roasted malt. The bourbon comes through in combination with the vanilla. The coffee is more muted than I expected, but not absent, and is more apparent as the glass warms. Delicious.
Very thick mouthfeel and only a small notice of the alcohol for such a high abv. I was stoked to finally land a bottle of this version of the famous Bourbon County series. It does not disappoint. 856 charactersFanofHefe, Feb 05, 2012

Appearance: Black as night. Caramel brown head. Thin carbonation streaming from the bottom. Looks imposing.
Smell: Sweet molasses. Bourbon notes penetrate. Lots of malt and sweetness. Give this beer some time and with oxygen, it really develops a great nose. It's not very big, but its very well done and with a fantastic bourbon sweetness. 
Taste: O man. This is easily one of the most complex beers I have had. The sweet bourbon notes come up first. Very nice bourbon, can certainly taste the fantastic BCBS coming through. Next, the coffee. The acidic notes of the coffee come through and really add a nice touch. It complements the ABV which is barely present but does add a little heat. With the beer on the palate, the nose opens up and you can piece together the beer.
Mouthfeel: Fantastic. The carbonation is spot on. Just flows through your mouth. The consistency is perfect for this beer and it really allows the hidden flavors to come out. 
Overall: Wow, just fantastic. Easily one of the most complex beers I have ever had. There is so much going on here. The bourbon comes through first and provides a great backing. Next, the coffee notes come through a little more subtle but endure and provide a great aftertaste to compliment the burbon. The consistency is spot on. It's only (minor) drawback is the nose. I really wish it was a bit more pronounced or floral. The nose is complex and is a great teaser to the beer but just not as strong as I would have hoped. I really can't wait to enjoy a couple more bottles of this stuff. 1,564 characterscradke, Feb 04, 2012

Poured a dark brown, almost black with a slim half finger head that quickly went away leaving no lacing.
S-the first thing you smell is the amazing coffee smell. I use to live in Chicago and Intelligensia brews some great coffee. You smell it here along with Vanilla, Bourbon and roasted malt.
T-very solid, but it feels like a ever so slightly watered down version of BCBS, as if they cut it with 10% espresso. You only get a hint of the booze, but I can't get over that slight watery texture. It just makes me feel that this could/will get better with age.
M-I am hoping that fresh this beer is lighter on the tongue, and it grows a bit more toward the syrupy side as it ages. In 6months to a year this beer could really come together.
O-This is an amazing beer, but I enjoy this year's BCBS over it at the moment. I guess they are not kidding when they say "Ages for up to 5 years." I am gonna give it some time and see how it develops. 998 charactersunclejazz, Feb 04, 2012

A: Pours inky black, as expected, with dark brown hues and a one-finger mocha-colored head that dissipates really quickly. A bit of head generates when agitated, though. This is to be expected of a beer with this high of an ABV.
S: Smells heavenly. I immediately pick up coffee, dark chocolate, vanilla, wood, alcohol, and a bit of bourbon. Lots going on with the smell. Very nice.
T: Taste is all kinds of crazy. Immediately starts with a nice roasted coffee flavor. It’s supported by some dark chocolate and a bit of sweet vanilla. The sweet bourbon comes through a tad bit at the end, but it’s not as much of a bourbon bomb as I was expecting. Ends with notes of bourbon, wood, coffee, chocolate, and alcohol. Surprisingly not hot at all, considering the high ABV. The only traces of the ABV is a fiery sensation in the esophagus, as you would expect after drinking a nice bourbon.
M: Fairly smooth, but there is a good amount of carbonation for the style. I wasn’t really expecting a beer this lively. The beer leaves the mouth feeling slightly numb and also leaves you with a warmed throat.
O: About what you would expect if you mix a top-tier bourbon-aged stout with coffee from a top-tier coffee company. I’m not huge into bourbon-aged beers, but I loved the complexity this brew brought forth. I love coffee, so I guess it balances out. I was expecting the coffee to clash with the bourbon, but the bourbon is downplayed enough where this isn’t an issue. 
I personally would not age this beer. It’s not hot to begin with, and I fear that the coffee notes would dissipate with time, leaving the beer unbalanced. I was only able to procure one bottle (albeit effortlessly,) so I won’t be able to compare an aged version. But, I’d suggest drinking it now. It’s at its peak, in my opinion.
This beer is truly an experience. While I wouldn’t go apeshit over it, I think it’s definitely one of the best brews I’ve had. 2,035 charactersTTAmod, Feb 03, 2012

That being said, it will probably come with age. Mouthfeel is good, but I'd personally like a bit more carbonation (maybe it's just this bottle). Overall, a great beer that I look forward to shelving my extra of and revisit in two years. 513 charactersb3shine, Feb 02, 2012

Bottle #2208
From notes. I have enjoyed this several times in the past, but this review comes from a tasting in Utrecht (December 2011) as a result of Jeffo and doopiedoopiedoo's generosity. Thanks guys...can't wait to return the favor! Drank alongside Rare, Vanilla, and Regular (Vintage 2009).
A: Deep black. Quarter (flat, dark tan) fingernail head on vigorous pour.
S: Espresso (go figure) and lots of it. Roasted dark malt, chocolate, and hint of sweet, oaky bourbon.
T: Roasted espresso, dark chocolate, charred malt, and sweet bourbon. This coffee has faded in this particular bottle, but that is to be expected. It is still a very tasty brew!
M: Full bodied with soft carbonation.
O: A very good beer for sure, but if you have the 2010 vintage, drink it now - not a beer to be aged. The coffee has faded (and will continue to do so). However, for being a year and a half old coffee stout, this is still drinking very nice and smooth. The fresh stuff is absolutely amazing though, so start chugging the 2011 stuff too! 1,107 charactersspdyfire83, Jan 31, 2012

A- Pours black with a thin coffee colored head, looks thick and viscous, leaves little lacing. 
S- Rich, dark coffee beans, sweet bourbon, vanilla, wood, and a bit of brownie-like chocolate in the background. The aroma is delicious and jumps out of the glass at you.
T- I don't even know where to start. From the beginning I'm picking up on a huge blend of flavors, bittersweet dark chocolate and molten chocolate cake, roasted black coffee beans, then a warm, sweet bourbon flavor that is really mellow and does just enough to let the coffee shine without overpowering it, complemented by vanilla and very slight oak. Hops are hard to detect, but roasted malts provide a bitterness that keeps the sweetness in check. The balance is amazing, this is really one finely put together beer.
M- Full bodied, just enough carbonation to provide a smooth, soooo creamy feel, thick and super chewy. Alcohol is nicely warming.
O- This might be as close to a perfect stout as I've ever tasted. The flavors are incredibly rich and just melt seamlessly into each other. I'm just totally floored, this is easily one of the best beers I've had. 1,222 charactersWillCarrera, Jan 31, 2012

2011 vintage (even though it's release date is 2012) Served in a Cervoise Glass at Durty Nellie's in Palatine.
The appearance is abyssal black and pours super thick, there is absolutely no head on this beer what so ever, but it finds a way to make me forget about that pretty fast because once I smelled it god-damn was that wonderful. The aromatics off of the beer were the obvious notes of coffee and sweet bourbon, but even beyond that there was a candy like sugar smell and rich sweet milk chocolate aroma on the nose. One of my top beer smells ever. The aromatics amplified my enjoyment of the taste as well. The flavors were of a bourbon dark chocolate syrup to the point were I might consider this a dessert beer. The coffee is smooth and dosen't add really any bittering notes to beer what-so-ever. For something with dark chocolate, bourbon and coffee beans that is considered able to age for up to 5 years, this is smooth as heck right now. If it wasn't for the high ABV, I would have no problem drinking this all day long. Overall it was a great beer one of the best I've ever had the good fortune of trying. 1,224 charactersVdubb86, Jan 30, 2012

I really like to get as much of the Coffee taste as possible and aging this style tends to drop the coffee off fairly quickly and apparently. That being said I am very glad I drank this one fresh. If I had to sum up this beer in just word it would be 
"balance"
I get it's not the most exciting thing to read in a review initially, but when you think about this style and how much is going on you will soon realize how impressive of a feat that is. The smell is the only thing I scored under 4.5 mostly because I was hoping for a bit of a stronger coffee aroma. I smelled the sweetness of the aged bourbon more than the coffee especially as it warmed. This isn't necessarily a bad thing and still warranted a 4.0 because it smells amazing. When I finally decided it was time to taste this beer I was overwhelmed by what was going on. You get a great coffee note up front. This blends its way into an almost vanilla like bourbon sweetness. The back end is where the barrel really shines and you can taste the bourbon and wood with some lingering coffee taste still peeking though. It's definetly not as strong of a coffee flavor as one might think. Get your hands on a bottle and please drink it fresh! I see far to many year old reviews of this beer where people talk about its lack of coffee... this isn't something to age unless you have had it fresh once and want to see what it turns into. 1,520 charactersPlinytheFarter, Jan 28, 2012

A - Almost completely black with a very small dark brown head that disappears almost immediately. The Dogfish Head glass keeps a small head ring around the glass, my drinking partner who I split the bottle with had no remaining head in her Founders tulip after a few seconds.
S - Coffee, bourbon, some chocolate
T - Extremely complex beer with lots going on here. Lots of coffee on the front end that I assume will fade if you age the beer (drink it now!). It then moves on to a great blend of chocolate, vanilla, and bourbon. The bourbon shines on the finish, and takes over the entire taste. Just amazing.
M - Full bodied that coats your mouth. Incredibly smooth going down. 
O - So happy I was able to try this so fresh. The new coffee choice is even better than last year IMO, and has improved on what was already an amazing beer. They increased the alcohol to 14% this year, and I still get no alcohol burn. I suspect the bourbon flavor hides it, but either way, it is impressive. 1,044 characterskif, Jan 28, 2012

2011 Release - Intelligentsia Anjilanaka Beans 
This is thick as motor oil with a grainy look. There is less than a fingers worth of espresso colored head that is quick to dissipate. It is black and completely opaque. Slick lacing that is oily and coats the glass brown as it is swirled.
The nose is as brilliant as it gets. There is an enticing coffee roast that is noticed first, followed by vanilla sweetness, caramel, butterscotch, massive bourbon, and a bit of well covered booze that finishes off the quaff. 
The flavors are blended and balanced so damn nicely here. First, you are introduced to some fine coffee roast that tastes fresh as hell. Yum. Followed by the roast is some vanilla beans and cocoa. These flavors are certainly balanced with the coffee addition. The barrels really make this brew a special treat. After the coffee and vanilla notes, you get a hefty amount of a rich bourbony flavor. This comes with an obvious level of heat but not as much as I expected a 14% brew would have. Purely delightful and delicious. 
The mouthfeel has that classic BCBS viscosity to it that is thick and oily. Full bodied is an understatement here. Maybe obese bodied? Low carbonation suits this brew perfectly fine as it does with the other variants. 
Overall, I don't give out 5s too often but this brew is a perfect candidate for best beer consumed, EVER. Full of amazing flavors that are perfectly balanced between one another and just quality all around. I WANT MORE!! 1,537 charactersChugginOil, Jan 27, 2012

Let us hope this lasts up to the hype I have generated for myself... I've had it many times on tap now... What does the second running of the bottles turn out to be?
2011 BCBCS, here we go! Bottled 01/11/2012!
A- Yup. This nails it. Inky black darkness, jet black. Crimson edging. Light crisp bubbles, tiny rise up and has a great carbonation visible. Perfect lacing, amazing retention. It nailed it. Part 1 complete. Sticky viscous looking liquid.. let me just stick..my..nose..close enough... and..
S- HOLY FUCK SHIT BATMAN! It did it! They did it again! An amazing coffee roast I've only ever found closely reminiscent of HBI from FFF. Espresso roast, grainy, it smells like a mixture of beans and flavors. Its amazing the complexity. The back end has the bitterness you get when you roll into a coffee shop and know they are serving the quality stuff. A slight acidity to the coffee makes me think these aren't just your average coffee beans used. 
T- So many beers make it to this point and let me down. I really, really am scared to put my lips on it. I.. I... I smell, I stare, I smell, I stare, I must get over my stalking fetish and just take it! ITS MINE! I DESERVE THIS!... /slurp
Once again this nailed it. Opens dark fruits from a bourbon character. It rolls right into the coffee flavor. It tastes exactly like it smells. Roasty, delightful, berry-like, smoky, and bitter coffee grain. Not the full fledged strength of coffee grain, we are talking the level that you appreciate it. This ain't no cowboy coffee, but a mixture that throws me on the bed and I want it to ravish me more! After the coffee flavor you get a milk lactose sweetness, a bit of acidity from teh coffee that enhances the plum and date dark fruits. It bursts right into the hot bourbon finish. Carmel, molasses, ethanolic, and delightful. It is the finish that is clean in terms of astringent character, but also has sweetness to balance out the intense character. 
M- I'd do nothing to fix this. It has the heat I want, the stickiness, the carbonation, the lingering potential, the immense complexity. I'd drink this every night for the rest of my days. Its thick, creamy, immensely smooth, velvety, lightly carbonated opening, chewy. If I'm not careful it'll be hidden in the cracks of my lips, in between my teeth. 
Best. Beer. Ever. Without a doubt. 2,475 charactersKhazadum, Jan 26, 2012

4.78/5  rDev +4.4%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5From tasting notes 1/21/11, with fellow BA'a AngryNucleus and BeRanger. Beer #2 of the night.
2010 batch, bottled on 3/26/2010. 6 oz. pour into a Founders snifter.
A: Jet black with a very small ring of tan hed. Red edges and significant lacing. I loved the look of this.
S: Coffee, booze, bourbon, and... jalapenos?!? Interesting. Was not expecting that at all.
T: I wrote, "Oh my God. Delicious." Now to describe that sentiment: Vanilla and caramel on the front. Bourbon, chocolate, and faded coffee on the back. I can't believe how smooth this was.
M: Smooth and creamy. I was blown away by the mouthfeel and how the flavors blended perfectly.
O: The coffee was all but gone, but it left a smooth, rich, dessert-like stout in its wake. Absolutely delicious. I know there are many who prefer coffee stouts fresh, and this was certainly great as a fresh beer, but I am not disappointed that I aged it at all. Incredible, and one of the best beers of the night. 967 characterstravMI13, Jan 22, 2012

2010 Vintage Bottle:
A - Pours black with an off-white head, good amount of lacing.
S - Coffee, Bourbon, Roasted Malts, a little Chocolate.
T - Outstanding! The coffee flavor actually isn't as predominant as I thought it would be but it's complimented with the bourbon taste - not as hot as I thought it'd be, certainly helps with the year aged. Coffee / Bourbon on the back and almost a vanilla/toffee backbone.
M - Medium body, very rich and creamy. Smooth for the 13%.
O - This is outstanding and I can't wait to try the other BCBS's later tonight. The coffee is a wonderful compliment to an already outstanding beer. 697 charactersBeRanger, Jan 22, 2012

A: Poured a deep black, very similar to regular BCBS, slightly oily with a nice mocha colored head on top. Decent retention and sparse lacing. 
S: Lots of coffee grounds and some espresso with the bourbon playing a little bit of backseat here. A little bit of dark chocolate and hints of vanilla and oak. 
T: A nice combination of coffee, espresso, bourbon, and dark chocolate. I am happy that the coffee is not as strong as the aroma and that the bourbon comes through a little bit more than I anticipated. 
M: Full bodied, thick and chewy. Not much heat at all. 
O: Liked it more than expected, but not as much as regular BCBS, Vanilla, or Rare. 708 charactersmdaschaf, Jan 10, 2012

4.36/5  rDev -4.8%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.522 oz bottle, #2054 that was bottled on 3/26/10. Dobby gave me the hookup on this bottle, and it was allowed to warm some before being poured into my Duvel tulip.
Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout pours total black. Nigel Tufnel might say that it could be none more black. Three fingers of mocha foam rise up to crown the beer. Head retention is very good, but lacing is pretty much nonexistent. The nose is absolutely fantastic, I don't think I could ask for anything more. Rich milk chocolate, fresh brewed coffee, and smooth bourbon each jump out of the glass, no aroma dominating, but all of them quite pungent. The flavor doesn't quite live up the expectations set by the out of this world aroma. The milk chocolate aspect of the beer appears at the open, but fades quickly. That leaves the coffee, and a bourbon flavor that has a bit more bite than the nose would have led me to expect. The body is very full, with a perfectly subtle carbonation. The mouthfeel just doesn't have that creamy edge that would have completed the picture though. Almost two years later I'm impressed by how much coffee presence is left in Bourbon County Coffee Stout, and I'm looking forward to the next batch of this excellent bourbon barrel aged stout. 1,240 charactersaxeman9182, Jan 05, 2012

Look: the beer pours a dark black color with almost no head.
Smell: Pure chocolate, coffee beans with hints of vanilla.
Taste: Sweet chocolate and caramel, mixed with bourbon with a very nice bitter coffee aftertaste.
Mouthfeel: low carbonation, full bodied. 
Overall: After the Rare, this was my favorite. I am so thankful to Jeff and Erik for giving me the opportunity to try this one 536 charactersrvdoorn, Dec 30, 2011

4.14/5  rDev -9.6%look: 3 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 422 oz. bottle poured into a goblet.
Appearance - Pours a very dark black with a small tan head. No lacing. No retention. Sticky as hell. Looks like regular Bourbon County.
Smell - Bourbon and lots of it. I get the stout behind it a bit and some of the coffee, but really it's a bourbon show. After a strong whiff, I actually get a strong fruitiness that I didn't get before.
Taste - Bourbon again. Bourbon and coffee mix. It's a nice blend, really. It's not too coffee forward. Has a chocolate flavor in the back and a bit of a vegetal flavor that is odd. It's all about the bourbon, though.
Mouthfeel - So boozy. So very very boozy. Low carbonation. Not too heavy, but a thick, mouth-coating stout. It's a hint smoother than regular Bourbon County.
Overall - I don't think the coffee adds much. It adds a slight dimension. I do think it it's smoother, but it's my understanding that this has had a bit more time in the barrels. A delicious beer, but I think it's still rough around the edges. Tough not to be rough at this level of beer, though. 1,051 charactersAlieniloquium, Dec 17, 2011

Aroma of coffee, light vanilla notes from the bourbon and some peppery notes which don’t necessarily fit the style. Taste is mix between some astringent coffee notes with some vanilla and coffee a strange peppery feeling at the end. Body is quite full with nice creamy texture and good carbonation with no apparent alcohol. Good though definitely a notch below the other GI stout treatments. 515 charactersPhyl21ca, Dec 12, 2011

Thanks for sharing, Cavery! 
(Aged for 1 year)
Midnight black with a thin ruby brown head that doesn't stay for long. Some spotted lacing down the glass. As expected, this beer is gorgeous.
Incredibly rich, divine, and evolving aroma. Vanilla and earthy bourbon, a mild wood character, plenty of chocolate and rich coffee combine for something special. There also seems to be a bit of roasted chile pepper in the nose as well, strangely enough. 
Rich bourbon, chocolate, authentic and delicious roasted coffee combine with a welcome alcohol warmth. Delicious and complete. Other than Rare, this is by far my favorite variation. 
Though certainly a thick, rich stout, this one seems just a touch too thin--I suppose this would be my only complaint, though it's an afterthought.
Incredible. 809 charactersehammond1, Dec 07, 2011

4.43/5  rDev -3.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5I poured this into a shaker pint glass. I give huge thanks to Geneseohawk for this beer!
Appearance- An incredible obsidian as it pours from the bottle, a very heavy look to it. No way there are highlights in here, no light is going to penetrate this offering.
The head built to about a finger of milk chocolate colored foam before settling in to a slight cap. A good amount of lacing is coating the glass. So far, so good.
Smell- Oh yeah, definitely bourbon, and then some more bourbon. I am not very fond of hard liquor, but GI hit the mark with this bourbon stout. I am not really sensing any coffee though. 
There is a little bit of roast that escapes the clutches of the bourbon, but not much. A slightly sweet and musty quality comes through too. Sort of chocolatey and vanilla. This is gong to be a monster.
Taste- All about the bourbon in the flavor profile to start. It just absolutely dominates, with the other flavors only being hints in the finish.
Once my palate adjusted to the bourbon, which took plenty of sips, I started to notice some roast in there. Hints of coffee, but it is not bowling me over like a regular coffee stout would. 
I also really, really enjoy the finish on this one. There are great notes of vanilla and dark chocolate coming through. It adds a wonderful complexity to what started out as a bourbon bomb.
Mouth feel- Thick, chewy, coating the mouth- all wonderful notes, yet it does not feel flat like most barrel aged offerings do, smooth and mellow. It encourages sipping. 
Overall- Again, I do not have much tolerance for harder liquors, but if you stick around long enough, BCBCS really starts to show you some amazing things. 
The only real let downs are how subtle the coffee notes have become. Especially on the nose, where more vanilla and coffee would have been greatly appreciated. Worth the hype, and I am really grateful I got to try it. 1,896 charactersPintofbrown, Dec 03, 2011

A - By the looks of it, I could use it in my car.
S - Roasted malt, some bourbon, a little bit of chocolate but not to much coffee.
T - Chocolate, roasted malts, coffee and bourbon. In the end is some bitterness.
M - Heavy, thick but little carbonation.
O - This was a real treat and I was impressed by this wonderful stout. Thanks again Thijs for sharing.
I had another fantastic opportunity to taste this whale on a tasting organized by BA's Jeffo and Doopiedoopiedoo. They arranged 4 types of Goose Island - Bourbon Counties!!! The Rare (Green label), the Brand Stout (Grey label), the Vanilla bean aged (Yellow label) and the Brand Coffee Stout (Red label). So we could do a horizontal tasting, just absolutely marvelous. I believe the Vanilla bean version was arranged by the Brabander so he gets some of the credits too, thanks Thijs for sharing!
See for the total beer line up my review of the Brewery - Black Tuesday.
A4 - A blacker than black beer with a thin beige ring that goes for a head.
S4.5 - A chocolate coffee liquor, a true tremendous smell.
T5 - A sweet double coffee experience mixed with a nice heavy bourbon. What an absolutely great balance between the separate tones. There is such a great depth in this beer, different tones keep on coming, vanilla, caramel, dark fruit, etc.
M4.5 - A soft to medium carbonation, with a good bitterness in the finish. The thickness of this body is absolutely amazing.
O4.5 - A perfect coffee stout. 1,610 charactersMar02x, Dec 02, 2011

A: Pours thick and black with thin brown head that quickly dissipates into a collar. Leaves little to no lacing around glass.
S: Rich chocolate and oak with roasted malt. A touch of coffee and hints of vanilla from the barrel aging. A fair amount of alcohol but not overpowering. As it warms the alcohol does come out quite a bit more, making it harder to pick out the other aromas.
T: Lots of chocolate and dark malt, nice oak presence and a hint of coffee remains after over a year and a half since bottling. A definite alcohol presence to remind you of how big this beer is. Subtle notes of bourbon and vanilla and finishes with a slightly odd bitterness that I imagine is from the coffee. 
M: Thick and smooth full body with low-moderate carbonation and sweet finish.
O: Still drinking quite nice for a coffee stout after over a year and a half of aging. Quite smooth and warming, great sipping beer that goes down way too easy for 13% ABV. 1,043 charactersAzurescens, Nov 18, 2011

S Big bourbon obviously with a lighter coffee bean scent. subtle choco malt behind it all but smells nice and pungent. 
T Bourbon takes charge and stays close to a regular bourbon county but has a nice, definately not overpowering coffee taste. Very well integrated bourbon and coffee flavors compliment each other nicely. 
M Nice full body that felt the lighter side of heavy. Carbonation was light and felt pretty awesome. Very smooth and easy to drink.
O Awesome stuff. Had side by side with Nightstalker, Big John and Vanilla. Vanilla took the cake as most flavorful but this was definately up there. Flavors integrated perfectly. Coffee didnt overpower like other coffee stouts. Excellent stuff. 807 charactersGushue3, Nov 17, 2011

I was lucky enough to receive bottles of this from AleWatcher and memyselfandi many moons ago. Many thanks to both of you! Finally getting around to cracking one open.
The beer pours pitch black. The color of used motor oil comes to mind. Light doesn't penetrate at all. A thin coaster of light brown bubbles manifests itself atop the beer, then dissipates leaving a thin ring around the outside of the glass. The nose is coffee and char with some malt sweetness poking through. Taste opens with sweet roasted malt flavors. Coffee and oak follow in copious amounts. Caramel and vanilla, presumably from the barrel, fill out the flavor profile. Finish is dry with a very nice coffee aftertaste. The beer is full bodied. Thick and viscous with a low level of carbonation. This is a great coffee stout. The barrel has imparted a wonderfully complex melange of oak, vanilla, and caramel which compliments the coffee and roasted malt perfectly. Booze is almost undetectable, and at 13% that's saying something. Really enjoyed this one. Recommended. 1,074 charactersSideswipe, Nov 13, 2011
4.82/5  rDev +5.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to ZX6Chris for the bottle share
Look: Black and totally opaque 1/4 inch head and good retention and very little lacing. Exactly how a barrel aged stout should look.
Smell: The nose of the beer is absolutely fantastic. The wonderful coffee notes play perfectly with the bourbon vanilla and chocolate that are also present
Taste: Similar to the nose but for me the coffee is on the back end of the beer. Like the base beer the coffee version is simple and yet complex and has several layers of flavors to it and they just continue to get better and better with every sip. The bourbon is perfect and the vanilla balances perfectly with the coffee
Mouthfeel: Full body and low carbonation
Overall: Again just an exceptional beer and I give it a higher score than the base beer because the nose is so much better 820 charactersDarthKostrizer, Nov 07, 2011

4.67/5  rDev +2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours black with a tiny tan head that instantly fades to oblivion.
Sweet toasty vanilla, coconut, dark and milk chocolates, hints of espresso and mocha latte, wood, bourbon, black fruits and burnt toffee, with some roasty notes.
Just a great complex monster of a beer here. Burnt toffee really resonates, sweet milk chocolate, fudge, mocha, mollasses, prune, hints of raisin, caramel, vanilla, coconut, oak, black fruits, fruity botanicals coffee, deep and toasty, bourbon, AMD more. Creamy sweet with creme fresh like flavors. Amazing beer. 543 charactersmcallister, Oct 22, 2011

T - Sweet with espresso, bourbon, vanilla, sweet chocolate, roasted malts and light oak.
M - Full body and slightly slick with low carbonation.

A thin brown head sits for a moment then recedes quickly and leaves little lace. I don't use OMG very often but OMG! My glass smells amazing- bourbon (obviously), coffee, vanilla, dark fruit (fig), raisin, and a fresh bread-like aroma. The taste is equally amazing. The flavors blend well together and the coffee is far from overpowering. Well balanced if not a tiny bit too sweet. Full body and the usual low carbonation found in GIBCBS. 520 charactershombrepalo, Oct 17, 2011

A- pours black as night with a mohagany Hue. Minimal centimeter of dark espresso creams head that recedes into nothing.
S- starts of with caramelized sugar toasted vanilla oily espresso and a note of black strap molasses. Rich top shelf bourbon permiates the entire aroma without overwelming the beer. Soft round oak with a roasty finish and a heady booze componet. 
T- sweet caramelized sugar, molasses and sweet bourbon that continues till the finish and beyond. Toasty vanilla, licorice and soft complementry oak. Finishes with heady alchohol and espresso astringency balancing out the sugary booze. Long oily finish.
MF- oily slick velvet mouthfeel huge chewy body and fine soft carbonation.
D- slow sipping beer, perfect cigar beer.
Overall this is one of those perfect bourbon barrel beers were the barrel and beer support and complement each other. The coffee adds an amazing componet and is integrated rather well. Although I believe it has toned down with age. 989 charactersViciousknishs, Oct 11, 2011
4.33/5  rDev -5.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5A: Pours completely black with visible viscosity.  Not quite motor oil, but pretty darn thick.  A very thin mocha-colored head gently sits atop the blackness and remains there for most of the glass.  Great legs and a decent amount of lacing. 
S: Barrel characteristics are dominant ... great bourbon, oak, and vanilla right up front, making a wonderful English toffee aroma.  The coffee is a little more subdued that I had expected, but this is exactly what I was hoping for.  Being about a year old may have toned down some of the coffee qualities, but I was hoping that it would subtly add to the already complex BCBS.  GI nailed it with this one.
T: Coffee is a little more pronounced in the flavor, but it's not overwhelming at all.  The coffee is more concentrated and fresh, resembling espresso.  Bourbon, dark chocolate, oak, vanilla, toffee are just behind the coffee, really putting the taste buds to work.  Finishes somewhat sweeter than the start, but again, it's not overwhelming.  Amazing complexity yet balanced almost to perfection.  Just a bit of booze at the end that creates a complementary warming effect. 
M: This stuff can coat.  Thick, creamy, and viscous on the palate.  There is a weight to it that sits on the tongue and leaves almost as much of an impression as the taste itself.  Lower carbonation seems great for the beer ... just enough to enhance the flavors and creaminess, but not enough to make it prickly.  
D: I loved this beer.  Despite the "size" of the beer, it was pretty darn easy to put down.  The bottle was split four ways, and, although I wish I had some more of it, a fourth of a bottle was really enough to meet optimal satisfaction.  It wasn't work putting it down like some other big stouts, but might had become that if I had consumed any more.  Definitely my favorite of the BCBS lineup that I've tried thus far.  1,889 charactersMississipping, Oct 08, 2011

A: Dark with low carbonation. As to be expected.
S: COFFEE! I can not stress that enough. I can smell a little bourbon but the coffee is still there, and it's not bitter coffee.
T: Its great if you're a coffee stout fan, probably one of the best. A little bit of a bourbon taste, but wished there was more.
M: Very viscious but not as thick as the other BC brews. 384 charactersbiggied, Oct 03, 2011
4.28/5  rDev -6.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Thanks to SpdKilz for this!
Pours black as sin. I poured as slowly and as vigorously as I possibly could because I knew this would be a tougher brew to produce a head. I got a solid almost 2 fingers of frothy, creamy light mocha color. 
The oak, bourbon and vanilla jump out as usual with a BCS. It's not too boozy, and very aromatic. 
BIG wood, bourbon, vanilla and coffee on the lighter side. It's very roasted and rich. This has some age on it, so I'm sure the coffee isn't as pronounced as it could be, but with as great of a base beer as BCS is, it still adds to the dynamic of this beer regardless. 
It's thick and chewy, low carbonation if any. Lingering thickness. 
For as big of a beer as this is, the alcohol is well managed. Noticeable, but doesn't overwhelm and the barrel adds intricacy, not dominance. 
Well played. I will seek this out fresh and actually drink it next time. 895 charactersEgadBananas, Sep 25, 2011

Taste: A blast of creamy and smooth espresso, fudge brownies, vanilla, oak (charred), dark bakers chocolate, and slight hops.
Mouthfeel: Very thick and chewy but a creamy, velvety finish.

A - It pours black and not a lot of head. 
S - Smells boozier than I have had before. It also has a little vanilla smell. Not as bourbony as the regular BCS but still has a good smell. Anytime I open any version of BCS, I smell the beer for awhile and make moaning sounds before driniking it.
T - The coffee flavor has come down some but it is still very present. This beer tastes exactly how it smells-Awesome. I really dislike when a beer smells great and completely lacks the accurate flavor. 
M - Not much carbonation left in the beer. It's thick but extremely smooth.
O - One of my favorite beers (Top 5). I prefer the regular BCS to this one but it is still awesome. 751 characterskenm2118, Sep 14, 2011
4.16/5  rDev -9.2%look: 3 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Reviewed from a 22oz bomber. Bourbon County is already a massive beer with great flavors, the addition of coffee doesn't seem like it could change much. But somehow it added a complementary dimension, similar to the result with vanilla. I've had it on tap previously and honestly it's too big a beer no matter which source (draft, bottle), hard to drink too much.
It pours a dense looking and viscous dead black, little carbonation but lots of thick legs running down the glass, visually big. Bourbon and cocoa in the nose, more cocoa than coffee actually, this came off as much more of a chocolate bourbon stout (move over Sweet Chocolate Love). Smells pretty potent too, olfactary heat building.
It tastes big and imposing, skewed much more toward the sweet side than the standard Bourbon County stout. Cocoa + bourbon + a little coffee, way less coffee than initially expected from the name, still all joining together in a well melded/integrated flavor profile. Hot aftertaste but nothing unmanageable, this is a very aggresive beer flavor-wise.
Thick and coating, the visual legs on the glass translate to a dominating mouthfeel, nearly chewy in consistency. Big by every measure, this is too much beer for a 22oz bottle (unless you're sharing with a small crowd). 1,272 charactersTurdFurgison, Sep 04, 2011

Pour is pitch black with small khaki colored head. Looks like coffee in my glass. First smell is of sweet dark chocolate, bourbon, and slight vanilla. Coffee makes itself present at the end and aftertaste..but has faded quite a bit..as expected. Body is medium to thick and still carries just enough carbonation. I had another bottle of this about 6 months ago, and the strong coffee presence went perfectly with the sweet vanilla bourbon flavor. Still a great beer but I would recommend drinking this with about a year of age under it's belt. Fantastic beer, can't wait for the next release. 614 charactersRymar9, Sep 01, 2011

A: Oily and black as night. Very little head.
S: Exactly as expected: Smells like I poured a shot of great bourbon in a fresh cup of coffee.
T: Exceptional. The coffee is still very present in this one. Lots of strong bourbon tones that are only rivaled by the wonderful taste of the Black Cat. One of the best!
M: Fairly thick, but could be a little chewier. Good carbonation level.
O: I love this one. I think I still prefer the regular BCS or Rare, but I will still seek this one out when it gets released again. It will be interesting to see how a different coffee affects the taste. 703 characterscamil1mj, Aug 31, 2011

Pours black with a very small tannish head. The nose is huge dark coffee thrown atop BCBS (bringing bourbon, booze, chocolate, molasses, roast). Wow, this smells great. The taste is fantastic. Again, it is substantial dark coffee flavor integrated perfectly into the base beer and elevating it. Very dark coffee overlaid on the boozy bourbon helps bring the booziness down a touch, intermingled with chocolate, roasted malts, molasses. Yum. This integrates really well. The mouthfeel is really huge and viscous, with lower carbonation. This is really a fantastic beer. Try to make sure you get it fresh though, as I have had a sample of this not so fresh and the coffee fades. 719 charactersseeswo, Aug 20, 2011

Deep black color with a fine hazelnut mousse. Very sexy brew. Smells were faint, mostly chocolate and hints of bourbon on the nose, very subdued. Flavor was decadent, rich roast and chocolate, very creamy and rich. Melts on the tongue, very nice coating of the palate, very delectble brew. Coffee notes were very subtle, I wouldnt have known it was a coffee beer had it not been for the label. The bourbon has really integrated well with this beer, lush silky mouthfeel with minimal heat. Awesome beer, always a pleasure. More coffee please? 657 charactersTripphop, Aug 12, 2011
4.52/5  rDev -1.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a bottle (3/26/10) into a snifter. This bottle is compliments of scottyshades. It's been in the fridge since the day I got it, unintentionally aging after I became very ill. I remember trying this fresh at a tasting and being taken aback by the sharp alcohol bite. Here's hoping time had a positive effect on that.
The pour is very much like a regular Bourbon County Stout. Deep, dark black. Did you ever play Sonic the Hedgehog 2? If you did, do you remember the Oil Ocean Zone? It had the bad ass music that was almost Mortal Kombat-ish at first, and there were those annoying ass seahorses waiting to get you? Anyway, this beer very much resembles Sonic's oil ocean. A finger and a half of beige foam sits on top, fizzing audibly but never disappearing. As I pull the glass away from my mouth, it looks like there's going to be some quality lacing stuck to the glass, but most of it falls away, leaving few wispy strands behind.
The aroma shocks me. Far more coffee in the nose than I would have expected, given that it was bottled almost a year and a half ago. It's not the dominant scent, but I didn't expect much to be present at all. The dominant scent is chocolate. Lots and lots of chocolate, which by itself gives off bitter and sweet smells in addition to the coffee, dark fruits, and bourbon giving their own sweet and bitter elements. I'm really impressed by how well this has held up. 
Plenty of great flavors going on here. The best part is, it doesn't taste like rocket fuel like when I tried it fresh. Seriously, this beer was so damn hot when we tried it the first time that I couldn't really taste anything else. Time has been very, very kind to it. Lots of sweetness up front, probably more so from the bourbon than the chocolate. I was wondering where the coffee would be, and then, boom, it hit me in the finish. Ah, there it is. The finish is really interesting, with both coffee and bourbon in there leaving bitter/boozy/sweet notes in different spots. I'd never use "balanced" to describe any Bourbon County Brand Stout, but this particular one comes pretty damn close. Each element is big and bold, but they play together nicely. And the texture...
Okay, I love the texture of this beer. It's velvety, almost glassy if you want to think about it like the aforementioned Oil Ocean. It's rich, viscous...I'm reminded of the syrup chugging scene from Super Troopers. Unfortunately, no big, brown, beautiful lips here, so I'm left to just sip this one, which I'm perfectly happy with, because it is definitely a sipper. The 13% ABV, while not nearly as harsh as a year ago, is still very present. I'm definitely feeling a little warmth as I drink it. A great way to spend a couple of hours. Wonderful brew. 2,744 charactersGyle41386, Aug 11, 2011

Aroma of vanilla, scotch/bourbon, molasses, sea salt, some coffee notes but they are very tame. I thought the aroma were closer to a nice scotch from the Islay than a bourbon. Taste is sweet, molasses, some anise, a bit of coffee - to me it tastes as though the coffee bitterness just takes the edge off the bourbon sweetness BCS usually has. Palate is rich and smooth, nice alcohol warmth. Excellent. 462 charactersLuk13, Aug 07, 2011

Had this alongside a similar sampling of BCVBS. Pours very dark with almost no head. Aroma is amazing, good hints of coffee and bourbon. Taste is great, amazing how much coffee there is in the front end. The bitterness mixes well with the bourbon notes on the back end. It feels very smooth on the mouth compared to regular BCS but is still a little hot due to the ABV. Loved this!

A - Pours midnight black with a nice one and a half finger tall brown head leaving light rings of lace down the glass.
S - Smells of rich bourbon, fresh brewed coffee grounds, dark roasted malt, chocolate, vanilla, and some dry oak tannins. This one is all about the bourbon and coffee.
T - Starts off with a big dose of warm bourbon quickly giving way to a mix of rich coffee, chocolate, vanilla, and some dryness from the oak tannins. I heard the coffee was dropping off in this one, not in this bottle as it still has plenty to go around. The alcohol is ever present but never really gets to the point of being overpowering. The finish is a mix of dark roast and light bourbon heat, lingering for some time.
M - Heavy body and flavor with moderate carbonation. Big, boozy, feel with plenty of it lingering through the finish. The alcohol is still pretty strong in this one.
O - Damn this is still one of my all time favorite coffee stouts. The combination of rich coffee and warm bourbon is just so damn good together. I am glad I still have a bottle of this one in the cellar. 1,146 charactersorangesol, Aug 04, 2011

S - Dark fruits, bourbon, slight coffee aroma.
T - Dark fruits, bourbon, molasses, bit of coffee. The coffee was just about the perfect amount, you could notice it but it didn't overpower any of the other flavors. Definitely had a much smoother, more rounded taste than that of regular BCBS, even older vintages.

4.47/5  rDev -2.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5It pours a thick black, with a good half inch creamy mocha head, however this fades quickly to leave a slight ring. It looks pretty well carbonated and lively, with a constant stream of fine bubbles. The first thing that hit me was the bourbon, the smell is strong boozy bourbon with lots of woody vanilla. I got a bit of that roasted coffee bean smell but it is much more subtle than I was expecting. The first taste was a bitter dark chocolate, with the same heavily booze bourbon that was on the nose. Towards the end the coffee begins to assert itself with a fairly mellow medium bitter taste. There is definitely some vanilla sweetness in there and a slight toffee flavour. It produces a nice warming whisky-like alcohol finish, which I find the best part of all the Bourbon County Brand Stouts. 800 charactersPartyBear, Jul 19, 2011

The smell is absolutely fantastic. You immediately get coffee notes and then bourbon. Chocolate, toffee and caramel notes are also present. 
Taste was what you would expect from a bourbon county brand stout. Amazing. So different from the past because they used edelweis coffee for this one and its such an improvement over past Bourbon County coffee. Taste was very similar to the smell. Boozy, but not that boozy. Loved it on tap
The mouth feel is very thick and consist of very little carbonation. 
This is one of those beers that I always wished I had on tap and when I finally did I was blown away. 
Highly recommend this brew. 708 charactersJivanN, Jul 11, 2011

"Was that even worth the effort?"
-schwaeh
Dark, dark brown. Jet-black - imagine that. Tried to get a bit of foam but ended up with nothing more than a wispy skim. Thin ring of retention. Swirling helps.
Doesn't smell overly coffee-laden. Then again, it is one year old. Deep layers of chocolate. It's a cross between roasted and sweet. Hints of booze. Earthy overtones. Sugary molasses.
Tastes pretty good. Coffee isn't all that strong though it's most recognizable on the finish. Coffee beans and burnt espresso. Molasses, chocolate, cocoa. Nice, bold flavors. Plenty tasty all around.
Viscous, full-body. Sticky, sugary and slow-moving. Just enough carbonation. Moderately hot.
I would like to try this fresh. Regardless, it's enjoyable. 826 charactersRyan011235, Jul 06, 2011

A: Pours black with a thin head that reduced into an even thinner collar leaving hardly any lace.
S: Bourbon and coffee dominate with a few notes of chocolate, raisin, vanilla, plums and other dark fruits. 
T: Coffee, vanilla, and bourbon. Tastes very much like the regular BCBS except maybe with a hint more coffee. I think I get more vanilla than coffee in this. Still, this tastes awesome because the regular BCBS tastes awesome and I love it. 
M: Warm, slick and chewy mouthfeel with low carbonation. Soft and smooth all around. 
O: If I didn’t know this was brewed with coffee I probably would have guess it. Too bad that it’s a flavor that faded with time. None of that matters though, I still love this beer. It’s like saying they took a world class beer, added a great adjunct, but the adjunct flavor faded still leaving a world class beer. Drink it if you have it, and drink it fresh.
EDIT: Had to increase the score a bit because the 2013 vintage is just so freaking delicious. One of the best coffee stouts ever. Much more prominent coffee profile than I remember. 1,139 charactersscottfrie, Jun 27, 2011

A: Definitely a DARK pour. Very smooth and viscous with a pretty pleasing tan head that rises up about a finger high and then dissipates rapidly. Actually looks very good...
S: Definitely a hint of coffee, but not quite what I was expecting. A strong smell of roasted malt and a bit o' molasses. A very well-rounded, balanced nose.
T: I was slightly surprised by the pleasant undercurrent of bourbon, but the real delight was how well balanced the entire taste was. Malt, fruit, coffee and dark chocolate all cohabitated well. I think the coffee faded a bit over time, but would have been fantastic fresh. No real hint of booze. I approve.
M: The mouthfeel is delightfully creamy with solid carb. I really like how this beer plays in the mouth. 
O: Fantastic. 817 charactersmjyoung, Jun 25, 2011
4.67/5  rDev +2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I shared a bottle of this with two rad guys last night.
This beer pours very dark letting almost no light pass through. I heavy pour yields very little head, but what is there is a very dark caramel color. 
The smell is fantastic. The bitter smell of coffee was the first thing I noticed followed by sweet bourbon and roasted malts. As it warmed up the smell of vanilla appeared and balanced out the bitterness of the coffee. 
The taste was almost identical to the smell. When cold the bitterness of the Black Cat coffee is the first thing you notice. As it moves to the back of your throat the the bourbon and roasted malts shine through and are finished with a sweet caramel flavor. It is not until it warms (much like the smell) that some vanilla begins to appear and balances out the coffee bitterness. 
The mouthfeel is exactly what you would expect from a Bourbon County Stout. It is very thick and coats the whole mouth. There is very little carbonation which is also expected from this beer.
If I had access to this beer all of the time it would be one of my favorites to drink over and over. The alcohol is very well hidden and the beer is exceptionally smooth. It definitely lives up to the hype! 1,211 charactersStayWhatYouAre2, Jun 25, 2011
5/5  rDev +9.2%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5The appearance is thick and allows very little light to pass through on the edges. The head is a brown, similar to the crema on a perfect shot of Black Cat Espresso. A swirl allows the beer to coat this glass for a few seconds. The head dies quickly, leaving some islands.
Smell is a very distinct dark roasted coffee, which covers up some of the unique bourbon smell associated with the standard BCS, although it is still there. Dark chocolate present of course, as well as some cherries. Vanilla especially present after some warming.
Taste is perfect. First comes the bourbon, followed quickly by the espresso on the back of the tongue and through the nose. Some sweetness, almost molasses-like, but not cloying at all. Slightly woody. Alcohol is present, but hard to believe it is at 13%, and not off-putting at all. Extremely full of flavor and difficult to pick out everything. As it warms, some of the bitterness dies off and the sweetness kicks up.
Mouthfeel is thick and coats the mouth easily. Hits the back of the throat like a melted chocolate milk shake.

Pours a thick, opaque, darkest brown, with merest cap of light brown head fading quickly to a thin membrane. A swirl leaves oily bubble spots on the tulip.
Molasses, coffee, darkest caramel, sweet alcohol, chocolate, and merest hints of bourbon and mineraly/floral make an enticing, medium strenth bouquet.
Med./full flavor starts with roasty coffee,vanilla, and bourbon, alcohol warmth and spice, sweet molasses and toffee, picking up some nice bitter roast and light floral/herbal hop into a finish that features wafting alcohol, and sweet, clean, dry renditions of all the flavors as lingering ghosts of themselves mingling with tannic oak and clean bitter. The bourbon here shines while staying in back. Very balanced flavor assault, very delicious, just short of mind blowingly fine.
Mouthfeel is where this malt massacre meets moderation. So creamy, so easy on the palate, so full of flavor, lightly carb.'ed, and a finish that is the gift that keeps on giving. This beer's best feature, mouthfeel on a huge stout don't get better than this, folks.
I would say this beer is one of the finest stouts I've tried. Worthy of all praises it has received, I recommend this beer with highest enthusiasm. 1,262 characterscavedave, Jun 19, 2011

A-Pours deep black with 1/2 inch of mocha brown foam. Fades quickly, leaving almost no lacing.
S-Like bourbon county stout, but with coffee.
T/M-The roasty coffee bean flavors are well integrated into the base beer. Very similar to the original apart from the coffee note. My only real complaint is the sweetness. This beer is syrupy sweet and viscous. I'm splitting it two ways and my 12 oz glass is a chore to finish.

4.42/5  rDev -3.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Finally getting around to trying one of the bottles I've accumulated, from original release. A vigorous pour into a Maudite snifter yielded a good two fingers of dirty brown head. The body was, well, black (I think I've already used my Spinal Tap joke in my last couple stout reviews so I'll skip it here). The aroma was quite robust - coffe, boozey bourbon, roasted malt, chocolate, vanilla, sweet love. Coffee and alcohol were definitely most prominent. I will say, I never had this fresh so I don't have a baseline to compare it to, but for a year old coffee stout it was still smelling pretty perk-o-riffic.
Taste was quite nice. Bitter dark chocolate up front, followed by sweet malty chewy coffee with hints of vanilla. The alcohol was very warming but well integrated, and the bourbon flavor was subtle and balanced. The mouthfeel was thick and rich, creamy with low to medium carbonation. After finishing a drink it really coats your mouth with a wonderful residual deliciousness. Overall, a pretty outstanding beer that I wish I could have tried much fresher. 1,069 characterssurlytheduff, Jun 19, 2011

4.32/5  rDev -5.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 42009 vintage poured into my Darkside Fermentation sniffer.
Appearance: Black with no visible light penetration. It poured a dark tan head about a finger thick that recedes into a ring around the glass. 
Aroma: Huge amounts of bourbon, chocolate, vanilla, roasted grains and alcohol, with a more subdued coffee aroma than expected. I guess it would make sense because the beer is about a year old. 
Taste: Bourbon and alcohol are the dominate taste, even after a year it’s still pretty hot. There are subtle notes of chocolate, roasted grain and coffee. There was more coffee in the taste then in the aroma. 
Mouthfeel: Thick, syrupy, and sticky with a lingering alcohol burn on the finish and medium carbonation.
Overall: I would rate this one very highly, the only issue I had with it was how boozy it still was even after a year. I also think the bourbon over powered some of the other flavors a little. 912 charactersjamescain, Jun 14, 2011

Appears quite dark, almost black and glossy.
Upon hitting the nose, there are distinct booze and coffee smells infused with a sweetness in the aroma.
I expected it to be....ALCOHOL...and then coffee, but I was pleasantly surprised at how the coffee was blended. The bourbon was there, but it was cut nicely by the bean flavor. Must less harsh than the BCS on tap.
The feel was smooth and had a great combination aftertaste. I am not a coffee drinker, but I really enjoyed this.
I know aging will kill off some of the coffee, but I'd love to see how it blends compared to the BCS non-coffee version. Hopefully I will get my hands on a bottle next fall. 716 charactersDuffman929, Jun 06, 2011

And one huge thing I love in a stout is big coffee presence, this beer has it. Pitch Black with a great tan slight slight head. Coffee, few dark fruits, coffee, coffee, some vanilla, and little bit of booze smell. Tastes of Sweet coffee up front, followed by the little hint of fruitiness, and finishes with a sort of vanilla booze. Goes down pretty darn good for its 13 percent abv. Definitely recommend sharing this gem with a friend as it can creep up on ya. If you get the chance get this beer is well worth it.

4.59/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5On tap at GI Clybourn during Rare Stout Night, 25 May 2011. Four ounces into a taster.
This pours night black with a very small tan head rising and falling quickly with no lace. On the nose, there is a slightly stale, day old coffee note hanging over everything else, the bourbon and vanilla and oak and chocolate. I couldn't decide whether I liked it or if it fell into the category of, say, Bell's Java Stout where the old coffee grounds are too old, but this ended up hitting really well for me. This isn't usually how I like coffee in stouts, but it's a perfect example of the other approach. In the mouth the coffee was foremost but the chocolate and vanilla mixed well together, too. It isn't really balanced but it's not quite a coffee bomb either. It's coffee-forward, maybe even coffee-dominated, but not coffee-exclusive. The body was huge like BCBS, but without the ultra-stickiness that wrecked the finish on that beer for me. It isn't nearly as hot as I found BCBS to be. 
Overall, it seems that the coffee was a great addition to BCBS, a beer I liked but didn't love. This is closer to love. The coffee was approached in a way I usually dislike, but it worked well here, possibly because of the copious amount of bourbon and vanilla in the base beer to stand up to it.
EDIT - Shared a bottle of the second batch last night. The nose was incredible. Bumped up scores to reflect this. 1,399 charactersEricCioe, May 26, 2011

@Lost Abbey
Jason, my tattooed beer friend. Thank you so very much for all the beer love.
App- Into the glass was a good stout colored beer with a nice 1/2 in head and some cling down the sides. Was a pretty standard looking stout.
Smell- Im not sure if the coffee faded so much to only leave a small bitter smell with some malt and a little chocolate.
Taste- I had such high hopes for this one after the Vanilla being my favorite beer of all time. The fade on this amazing so much flavor I fear was lost on this beer. It wasn't anything like I hoped, thin, small, no coffee, no dark roast. Like a small foreign export stout
Mouth- Medium bodied and low carbed, just left a pretty bland stout after taste.
Drink- Its still a pretty tasty stout but some flavors just left me a bit put off with the fade. Glad I got to try it though. Wouldnt mind a fresh bottle at next release. 918 charactersFosterJM, May 20, 2011

This ale pours black with dark brown edges. A thin brown head sits for a moment then recedes quickly and leaves little lace. I don't use OMG very often but OMG! My glass smells amazing- bourbon (obviously), coffee, vanilla, dark fruit (fig), raisin, and a fresh bread-like aroma. The taste is equally amazing. The flavors blend well together and the coffee is far from overpowering. Well balanced if not a tiny bit too sweet. Full body and the usual low carbonation found in GIBCBS.

Bottled on March 26, 2010.
A- Pours almost completely black with a very thin tan colored head that disappears immediately, leaving very little lacing. Not expecting a lot here given the base beer.
S- Just what I was expecting. Fantastic bourbon, oak, an vanilla notes, with a slight hint of coffee. Coffee gives it just enough variation to distinguish it from the regular BCS. I absolutely love the aroma of this beer.
T- Coffee comes through immediately, although it has died down from the initial bottling date, or so I assume. The age has definitely given the bourbon and oaky vanilla notes time to blend in well with each other and the coffee, melding perfectly. Chocolate malt characters come through faintly in the end. A fantastic sensory experience.
M- Thick, oily, and viscous. Coats the mouth and throat with a commanding presence, and lingers long after the initial sip. Perfectly carbonated.
O- Even though the coffee notes have died down, giving this time to have the overwhelming bourbon tones of the base BCS blend together made this beer infinitely more appealing to me. I still have a Vanilla and Rare sitting in my cellar, so I'm excited to compare those to this. A superbly well made brew. 1,253 charactersJoshVandy, May 16, 2011

4.41/5  rDev -3.7%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 22oz. bomber into a Tulip.
I was never a big fan of coffee stouts, but BCBVS really stirred things up quite a bit. It pours a dark chocolate black, with a small head that quickly dissipates. It smells of coffee(intelligentsia black cat, one of my favorite coffee beans), vanilla, bourbon, and slight oak. Tastes like a regular BCS, with the exception of a faint coffee wave in the back of your palate. Also get to taste the vanilla and the boozy bourbon/oak. When drinking, BCBCS leaves a sheath of oily bourbony coffee-y(now i'm coining that!) goodness in your mouth. Very easy to drink, not too hot at all, for the big beer that it is. Excellent stuff! 669 characterstrodersark, May 10, 2011
4.47/5  rDev -2.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.522 oz bomber courtesy of FrankenBrew. Pours dark black with a light layer of brown head. Not much lacing.
BCS already has such a massive nose that I am not sure I can fully appreciate the coffee additions. Loads of vanilla and bourbon...lots of wood too. Nutty and robust.
Taste is smoother than I would expect of a fresh BCS. The coffee is more noticeable and grows on the aftertaste. Tons of vanilla pops out as it warms; and the bourbon is plenty big with mad woody undertones. Very cool beer, but a bit of a paradox for me as far as aging is concerned...less coffee but smoother brew? Either way I suppose you cant lose with this tasty beverage. 651 characterstwiggamortis420, May 01, 2011
4.2/5  rDev -8.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Appearance: This beer pours out a very dark brown color that appears pitch black in glass. One finger medium tan colored head forms which has decent retention and lacing. Good looking beer.
Smell: I get a lot of roasted malts of course as well as a pretty obvious coffee presence that really adds something. A good barrel presence as well, but they do seem a bit on the muted side. The barrel has definitely given-way a bit here.
Taste: A lot of roasted malts up front of course. And here is where I can really tell the difference between this and regular BCS. I get a great deal of coffee flavor, and a nice barrel presence that isn't too prominent. A good deal of bitter baker's chocolate comes out as the beer warms more, and the bourbon presence integrates better too. 
Mouthfeel/Overall: Between medium and full bodied with fine carbonation, and is pretty creamy overall. Overall, the flavor is the highlight of the beer for me without a doubt. The coffee is a nice addition to the base BCS. 999 characterszhanson88, Apr 28, 2011

Big thanks to cpetrone84 for sending me this one in a LONG past trade! Served from bottle into a Southern Tier tulip. Poured pitch black with a one finger brown head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. There was no lacing evident throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, roasted malt, dark chocolate, and coffee. The flavor was of sweet malt, roasted malt, dark chocolate, coffee, and toffee. It had a heavy feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was a pretty tasty brew. As hinted by others some of the coffee aspect has definitely faded on this one sitting in my cellar, however, with me not drinking coffee at all it is still definitely present for myself. I really liked the toffee aspect I got on this one to add a little sweetness to the roastiness you get with the dark chocolate and coffee present. Really glad I got to pull this one out of the cellar for the tasting I was planning on doing myself someday, but getting to share it with some awesome BAs at the same time. This one is definitely worth picking up still, but I would do it in a hurry if you are concerned about the coffee fading. 1,340 charactersthagr81us, Apr 27, 2011

Came to the table pitch black, and highly viscous. No head to speak of, and very little lacing/foam. (The bottled version had a lot more foam - decent mocha head.)
Smell is awesome. Coffee, bourbon, vanilla, oak, chocolate and roasted malt. 
This is the third time I've had it, and the coffee has definitely faded from what it was, but is still noticible. Coffee's the first thing you get - but it quickly flows into a smooth, sweet bourbon charachter with some vanilla, chocolate and malt underneath.
M - Thick and viscous. The draft version didn't have enough carbonation - the bottled versions didn't suffer from that problem. They were creamy and nicely carbonated.
Overall - great, great beer. Top notch. 820 charactersreadbaron, Apr 22, 2011
4.59/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.522oz 2010 bottle into snifter.
A - Used motor oil black. Very small yellowish brown head that dissipated quickly leaving slight collar. Very small lacing
S - Incredible and rich. Chocolate, coffee, oak, vanilla, roast, sweet bourbon. Very deep, I probably smelled this thing for 10 minutes as I let it warm up before first sip.
T - Coffee was not overwhelming and balanced perfectly with the bourbon, as equal shares. Sprinkling of vanilla, molasses, oak and chocolate cake. Amazing.
M - Heavy, rich, sticky
O - This beer is overwhelming good and drinkable. I was a little worried about losing some of the coffee as it is almost a year old. I think the little time in the cellar helped to mellow the bourbon and coffee a bit and allow the background flavours to come out. Absolutely awesome beer. 801 charactersOakedCanuck, Apr 21, 2011
4.85/5  rDev +5.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Bottle shared with Steve and crew for the festivities, originally sent to me by AJacob81. Cheers guys, thanks again. Bottled March 26, 2010, into a few snifters.
Pours pitch black, tan head with minimal retention. Leaves a collar of head. No lacing, but has legs for days. Nose is bourbon, dark chocolate, oak, a hint of vanilla but not a significant amount of coffee. I suspect it has faded, over a year since it's bottling. Taste has some warming bourbon, oak, vanilla, more oak and more friggin bourbon. Finishes dry and roasty, and the chocolate and espresso notes don't really come through until late in the finishes. Layers upon layers of flavour and complexity here, just unreal. More keeps coming through well after the sip is over. Alcohol is mellowed and the body is so full. Low carbonation, minimal alcohol burn and aids in its drinkability. A real sipper, but drinks like a charm. Extremely impressive, and I'd be very curious to try this fresh with more 'coffee.' This set a new bourbon barrel standard for me. 1,025 charactersliamt07, Apr 19, 2011
4.18/5  rDev -8.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Had this a while ago next to a vertical, Vanilla, and Rare. It's great, but not as good as the others to me.
Has an oily black look and brown head as the other BCS varieties do. Excellent look for a stout in my opinion, and the feel also has a surprisingly smooth feel and small carbonation, which I like from a big stout. Alcohol complexity in the feel, but not a whole lot of heat which is great.
The smell is good, but I think at this point, the coffee has faded quite a bit, though there is a little extra roast added to the Bourbon, vanilla and deep leathery malt. I feel like the coffee at this point has just made the other flavors of the beer a little less intense and much more tame. 
The taste is good as well, though again I think there is a void where the coffee once was at this later date. The obviously good flavors of regular BCS are there but again at a lower scale. 
Overall the beer is still great, but I prefer Rare for sure and even kind of like regular BCS more, especially at this point the 08' vintage. 1,030 charactersDreadnaught33, Apr 16, 2011
4.47/5  rDev -2.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Bottle shared by Dan – much obliged!
Pours black with a half-finger brown head. The head recedes into a wispy layer on top leaving solid lacing and better legs.
Smells of moderately roasted malts with good amounts of dark chocolate, vanilla, and smooth coffee. Also present are hints of butterscotch and even lighter hints of molasses.
Tastes very similar to how it smells. Robust roasted malt and smooth coffee flavors kick things off and are joined quickly by dark chocolate. Midway through the sip the bourbon shows its face with moderate amounts of vanilla and butterscotch. The flavor profile sweetens a bit near the end of the sip as the dark chocolate and vanilla intensify, carrying through to a mildly bitter ending.
Mouthfeel is very good. It’s got a smooth thickness with soft carbonation.
Drinkability is also very good. I finished my glass quickly and could easily have a few more.
Overall this beer was all it was cracked up to be, although I have to believe the coffee has faded. The smoothness associated with it remains however, and it hasn’t turned bitter as happens sometimes with older coffee beers. I’d recommend drinking yours now as I can’t imagine them getting any better, but be assured you’ll still enjoy them even this late in the game. 1,281 charactersglid02, Apr 15, 2011

S - Aroma is bursting with bourbon and coffee. Lots of oak and deep roasted malts as well with a bit of vanilla.
T - Immediately hits the mouth with lots of bourbon and coffee flavors. Nice vanilla and sweet malt tones beneath. Through the middle, some strong oak and almost chocolate espresso flavors. The finish is another hit of coffee and bourbon with some oak flavors and just a bit of alcohol flavor at the very end. Lingers nicely.
M - Full bodied with moderate-low carbonation. Lots of flavors really fill the mouth nicely and the alcohol flavor warms the mouth in a pleasant way.
D - For 13 % abv, this drinks really nicely. It is really flavorful, but at the same time pretty well balanced. The coffee flavor is an excellent addition. 942 charactersngeunit1, Apr 13, 2011

A) As with all of the barrel aged stout offerings from GI, jet black, little carbonation and medium lacing.
S) Coffee and Vanilla, surprisingly light on the bourbon though.
T) Coffee and Vanilla with a bit of a chocolate finish. Again, what surprises me is how muted the bourbon is as my 2008 regular versions are a bourbon bomb!
M) Smooth, what really drives this rating is the absolute lack of alcohol bite, yet (after some time) you still know that it is there. 
O) Without a doubt one of the better beers I've had. I think the one year on this worked very well. But still I wonder what this was like fresh! 776 charactersjimmy82063, Apr 08, 2011

*reviewed from notes*
Pours an oily/slick black with a thin tan head that persists throughout. Very dense/thick beer. Nose is mostly bourbon and burnt espresso. Flavor is what I expected. Dark chocolate covered espresso beans, vanilla, roasted malts, caramel/brown sugar. Very sweet (but not cloyingly) and rich. I would drink this over other bourbon/coffee stouts any day of the week, if it came in a 12 oz. bottle. Glad that this was split 4 ways. 524 charactersmuttyd, Apr 04, 2011
3.36/5  rDev -26.6%look: 2 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3 |  overall: 3.5A: Pours thick black with only a centimeter or so of chocolate-colored head even with a rough pour. Within a minute, the head has completely vanished leaving no lacing or even a thin ring to indicate the beer is even carbonated. Even with a vigorous swirl, the beer stays as flat-looking as coffee. 
S: Some semi-sweet chocolate followed by lots of vanilla, oak, and bourbon. The bourbon almost burns the nose it's so strong.
T: A little roasted malt with light chocolate flavors at first followed by the overwhelming bourbon flavors with vanilla and oak. The finish has a strong alcohol burn along with some toffee flavors and just a faint hint of coffee.
M: Very thick body with almost no carbonation, this beer is very sweet and coats my mouth. 
O: Overall, the best of the Bourbon County series that I've had (better than regular or vanilla versions). The coffee is unfortunately undetectable and I probably would not have even picked up on it at all had I not expected to find it somewhere. Really the only way I can tell that this beer has coffee in it is the fact that it's not quite as sweet as its non-coffee counterparts. I know the coffee may have faded some, but I've had other bbal coffee stouts with a year of age and could still detect the coffee. The bourbon again dominates the flavor and the nose like it does in the other Bourbon County series. Not a bad beer, but I would need much more balance in it to call it good. 1,441 charactersn2185, Apr 03, 2011
5/5  rDev +9.2%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5(this review is from notes, early April 2010)
Poured out of a 22oz bottle in early April after allowing to sit for twenty minutes once removed from the fridge.
Appearance: Pours a silky black with slight caramel head. Very dark with slight brown coloration, evident in the quickly dissipating head.
Smell: Smells strongly of coffee beans, bourbon, and alcohol. Very aromatic and somewhat sweet aroma, similar to caramel or brown sugar.
Taste: Delicious combination of coffee beans, bourbon barrel, and alcohol. Vanilla is an off flavor from the base and bourbon aging. Alcohol not overbearing but definitely present. Taste the sweetness and coffee before tasting bourbon on the backside. After taste is a little boozy.
Mouthfeel: Just slight carbonation. Very smooth on the palate.
Drinkability: Very drinkable, but due to alcohol content could only drink one, 22oz, at a time. Just slight warming to the throat and bourbon flavor resonates to the chest.
Overall this is one of the best beers I've ever tasted (out of near 400 different beers). It is both strong and flavorful and an excellent representation of an imperial stout. I would highly recommend this to anyone who can find it. I'm under the impression it's release was limited and that the beer was very hard to find. I grabbed two bottles for aging and will try them again in another year or two 1,364 charactersaasher, Apr 01, 2011

Bottled on 03/26/10
Purchased at Cambridge Wine & Spirits, Cambridge, MA
Served in a snifter
The liquid poured a thick, oily, dark brown/black color and was topped by a fleeting layer of caramel colored bubbles.
The aroma was simply amazing. Super intense and complex. Strong, freshly brewed espresso was instantly recognizable. Bourbon notes came through strong. Boozy but not overly so. Quite sweet with loads of brown sugar and vanilla. Hints of dark chocolate appeared as the beer warmed. It seemed like every time I smelled the beer, another aspect took center stage. Near the drink's end, the bourbon component really started to dominate.
The taste was every bit as good as the nose. Thick, rich, robust and complex. Layers upon layers of flavor. Espresso notes were most apparent. Lots of dark roasty malts up front. Rather sweet overall with intense vanilla and brown sugar notes. Bourbon came through strong on the roasty, slightly bitter finish. Somewhat boozy. An oaky, woodiness lingered in the aftertaste. Although the coffee and the bourbon elements were both intense, they balanced each other quite well. For a 13% ABV imperial stout, this beer drank like a dream.
Full-bodied on the palate. Super rich, creamy and smooth with a fine, moderate effervescence. The liquid left a sticky film on my lips.
Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout is full of amazing complexities. Each sniff and sip offered something entirely new. If you have any 2010 bottles in your cellar, I would recommend drinking them as soon as possible. I simply cannot imagine this getting any better. All in all, one of the greatest beers I have ever tried. 1,683 charactersDamian, Mar 25, 2011

Vintage: bottled 03/26/2010
Pours a fully opaque black with a half-finger head that dissipates quickly leaving only little in the beer. Lacing is sporadic and average.
Nose is definitely of roasted dark coffee with some brown sugar sweetness and a dry bitterness that is soft but clear. Bitter dark chocolate adds a great deal as well to the aroma - great balance here. Could use strength though.
Taste is a creamy blend of semi-sweet chocolate, excellently balanced coffee and boozy spice at the end. Milkshake-chocolate syrup dominates the start with vanilla to add to the beer, while coffee takes over in a docile way to finish it off in a bittersweet manner. Really solid taste, and I love how strong each individual flavor is - the chocolate and sweetness have been spoken for, but the coffee is fantastically weighted in the finish if I haven't made it clear already.
Mouthfeel is creamy, thick, viscous and syrupy. Perfect for the style and helped by the warmth the booze provides. Drinkability is awesome as well, especially considering the 13% abv - it's only evident taste-wise and never by heat or in any unpleasant manner. A burn present at the back of the throat at the end of sips kind of goes against the silkyu mouthfeel and drinkability, but its fantastic nonetheless. Can't wait to have the other varieties of BCBSs. 1,429 charactersveinless, Mar 24, 2011

Tasted side-by-side with Bourbon County Vanilla. Split with russwbeck.
A - The pour yields an incredibly viscous-looking beer; incredibly thick and slowly and ominously fills the glass. The color is somewhere between black as night and black as midnight. On top of the beer sits a 1-fingered, dark mocha colored it head. It is there, but by the time I turn my head away and back, it's gone. Afterwards, a thin layer of foam lingers in the middle of the glass, veiling the abyss beneath it. Lacing, like the other members of the Bourbon County family. is pretty much non-existent.
S - The nose on this beer is extravagantly big, with depth comparable to Rare Bourbon County (without being as refined or smooth, however). The coffee is bold and could probably give you your caffeine fix for the day. I'm also getting a lot more chocolate in this than in the regular Bourbon County (at least compared to the '07 and '09 vintages). The chocolate is thick and sweet, almost like fudge. Overall a sweet beer that has a big malt influence. I feel the bourbon is a bit overshadowed here, as the coffee steals the show. When comparing the Coffee and Vanilla versions, I have to give the edge to Vanilla in this category as it adds that much more depth to the beer and the contrast with the chocolate and bourbon is fantastic.
T - If the coffee was apparent in the nose, it's 10-fold in the taste. It's roasty while still being smooth, with a bold espresso flavor. The coffee itself integrates perfectly with the chocolate fudge to make a very appetizing flavor. The bourbon comes through early and melds with the melange of flavor, almost bringing in hints of dark fruit. The bourbon, despite the name, isn't the focus of this beer but brings it to that next level to round everything out. It's tough to pick which one I prefer in the taste... the Coffee version is right up my alley with bold espresso, but the Vanilla is the more unique of the two... I will call it a draw!
M - Mouthfeel is heavy-bodied with low carbonation. Extremely smooth and creamy, however, so it's very easy to drink. The alcohol is incredibly well-hidden as well. Coats the palate thickly, and the finish is all coffee and bourbon. I have to give the edge to the Coffee version here, as it has slightly more carbonation and it's smoother.
D - This reminds me more of the Rare Bourbon County Stout than the normal versions as it hides its alcohol so well. I would never guess that this was a 13% beer. Incredibly bold and flavorful, and the coffee does so many good things for this beer. 2,666 charactersnhindian, Mar 22, 2011

A: They both look exactly the same. Black in color, a hard pour gave a nice sized brown head, a bit lighter than the Vanilla Stout. Recedes down to a film along the brim of the glass. Very nice lacing.
S: Big fresh coffee bean smell, but it masks the bourbon a good deal. Not really getting any alcohol here, but it isn't quite as balanced as Vanilla Stout.
T: The coffee taste is present in the beginning and sticks with you throughout. The bourbon is subtler than I expected, coming after a big hit of coffee. Very slight oak and vanilla noticed, but no alcohol.
MF: Bit of a tinge of carbonation, but not a lot. Very heavy bodied and pretty dry throughout.
O: I like the Vanilla Stout better than this one, but it is still better than regular '09 Bourbon County Stout, and especially the '07. Neither are on the level of Bourbon County Rare, however. 930 charactersrusswbeck, Mar 22, 2011

S: Good bourbon mixed with a deep dark chocolate and earch coffee roast, molasses, fudge or brownies, some orange. Really great.
T: Espresso, dark thick chocolate like mousse, the bourbon is smooth and lingers like hot breath on the finish, with raisins and figs and molasses, oatmeal creaminess, cigar smoke for a bit with some walnut and orange zest. This is great.

A - Pours black, tan head, some bubbles here and there, spotty lacing and some whisps on top.
S - Huge chocolate and coffee notes, smells so damn good. Also, some oak/barrel characteristics, slight dark fruit, caramel. The coffee and chocolate notes are so outstanding, it's amazing.
T - Chocolate covered coffee beans with a touch of oak mixed in. The alcohol is barley noticeable at all, which lead to my downfall a few hours after sampling this about 6 times.

A: Pitch black body with a finger of fleeting brown head that settles into a fine ring and reappears with subsequent swirls. Looks like a huge stout, just like it should.
S: Coffee's there, but significantly faded from the fresh version I sampled at DLD. Intense bourbon, oak, and profoundly spicy alcohol. Lovely, lovely aroma.
T: Coffee, caramel, bourbon, vanilla, spice, and intense, almost chewy oak. Super oaky, super bourbony, and plenty of coffee bitterness. I love this beer.
M: Viscous full body with smooth, soft underlying carbonation. Perfect for what it is.
D: Better than regular or Vanilla, the coffee really helps cut through the booze.
Notes: While I was a little sad that the intense coffee was largely gone from the aroma, a year has also mellowed out the 13% considerably. The oak is actually the most dominant aspect of this beer, and it's delicious. I'll definitely be on the lookout for more if and when this gets released again. Spectacular.

So nearly a year old.
A - Near perfection a nice oily black liquid pours out of the bottle like velvet there is a thin 0.25 inch tan head that forms and quickly recedes to a tan ring around the glass.
S - Aroma starts off with strong fresh espresso hints. Nice toasty bread notes are mixed in with some great roasted and dark malt aroma. The coffee notes are delicious and complex with some burnt smokey and some nice grassy and earthy tones. There is some slight sweet chocolate notes as well as some awesome bitter dark chocolate notes that compliment the espresso notes perfectly. This aroma is hands down perfection. 
T & M - Velvety and silky smooth liquid yum. Starts off with some great roasted and slightly smokey malt notes and some fresh DELICIOUS espresso notes. The coffee is by far the dominant note and it dominates so well with great flavor and not just overwhelmingly. There is some slight sweetness that pops its head up through all the coffee and it has some slight chocolate and caramel hints to it with some brown sugar as well. The Bourbon notes also are complementary tot he coffee as well as some slight woody vanilla hints. It is perfectly balanced. This beer is delicious. Has to be one if not the best stout I've ever had. The body is silky smooth and rich. Full and complex with perfect carbonation and not too intense boozy heat.
D - Yum! This beer is so delicious. I wish it was a year round offering or at least a seasonal. This is better than their regular BCBS. The ABV is deliciously and dangerously hidden. 1,603 charactersJoEBoBpr, Mar 01, 2011

D - Blows my mind that it's 13 percent. So smooth and no alcohol burn. An amazing balance between the coffee, bourbon, and malt. 444 charactersDNICE555, Feb 28, 2011
4.65/5  rDev +1.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I was really excited about this beer. I traded for 3 in the hopes that I would try one, cellar one, and trade one but I am going to drink all of them and try to trade for more.
Poured an oil black whit tons of brown head on 12/27/11.
Smells of tons of Coffee as it should and chocolate. Smell mixture is absolutly delicious.
Tastes exactly like it smells. Coffee is the main taste but the chocolate comes out nicely and is the award winning part of this beer. I could drink this all day and not get sick of it. Please make this a regular Goose Island.
Mouthfeel is excellent as well. Sticks to your mouth just enough to be left over for a minute but leaves without any bite shortly later. I love having this in my mouth as gross as that comment may sound.
Drinkability is awesome. I want Goose to brew this every day and have it as a regular. This beer lands in my top 3 stouts. If you have a chance to trade or try this jump on it now! I will be looking for this beer in the future. 988 charactersUMNbeerhunter, Feb 28, 2011
3.27/5  rDev -28.6%look: 3 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 2.522oz bottle poured into a Duvel tulip.
Pours a very oily dark black with a very fine dark brown rim of head. Nose is booze, booze, booze - it smells like it came out of the barrel with a ton of bourbon still in it, there is some coffee but you've got to look for it - it's not upfront.
Taste is very hot, it's 13% and it lets you know right off the bat. Like the nose it's a bit hard to find the coffee, but it does come through. Mouthfeel is light and sharp, there isn't much carbonation but that's ok because it's so hot you don't want much.
Honestly, I haven't been very impressed with any of the BCB series, too much alcohol and not enough flavor to mask it. This may be better with a few years on it, but by then the coffee will have dropped out. 754 characterskingcrowing, Feb 27, 2011
4.4/5  rDev -3.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Notes from last summer.
Pours pitch black, with minimal head and very little lacing.
Smell is wonderful sweet bourbon. Actually smells very similar to regular BCBS, not much coffee presence in the nose.
Taste is a very mild coffee presence, with bourbon and chocolate. A bit sweet and a mild alcohol presence.
Aerating this a bit gives a very creamy mouthfeel and a slight amount of bite from the hops.
Overall, a bit hot at the time of tasting, but still very flavorful. This should age pretty well, though the coffee is likely to fade. 542 characterswarnerry, Feb 24, 2011
4.9/5  rDev +7%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5As if regular Bourbon county wasn't good enough. This is just amazing. The coffee they use is my favorite espresso blend in the Midwest so it was delightful to try this at the map room last August. This pours a super dark black with jet engine gasoline mocha foam. Aromas are all fresh espresso, booze, oak, chocolate, dark malts and slight green hops buried way in the back. Taste is more of the same with a coating mouth feel and really fresh coffee, booze, and vanilla flavor. Drink ability is great but not a perfect 5 as I couldn't drink this one all night. It's just too intense. LOVE this stuff! 602 charactersfrancisweizen, Feb 23, 2011

Bottled date of March 2010.
poured aggressively into a snifter glass.
Appearance: black as black can be no light is getting through this beer. Brown thin head.
Smell: Smells of bourbon, chocolate, and roasted sweetened coffee.
Taste: Upfront a balanced taste of sweet malt, bourbon, and coffee. No bitter flavors or alcohol heat anywhere in this beer. Hints of molasses, oak, vanilla and caramel. 
Mouthfeel: Silky and smooth. NICE. Can't believe this is 13%. Its impressive.
Overall: The most impressive part of this beer is the balance between bourbon & coffee; also the fact that it was not a coffee bomb. The best coffee stout I have ever drank hands down; this is an epic beer! I am on the fence about which beer i like better between BCBS Rare or BCBS Coffee. Goose Island has stole the show when it comes to making amazing bourbon barrel aged stouts. 966 characters4DAloveofSTOUT, Feb 23, 2011
4.65/5  rDev +1.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Decided it was time to see how this one is holding up. Split with airohead2001.
A: Typical for the series. The beer is black with a mocha colored ½ finger head that has pretty good retention and some great lacing.
S: There's an incredible amount of balance here. It's not a coffee bomb on the nose like Short's Cup A Joe. The bourbon is not over powering either as is the case with far too many bourbon barrel aged beers in my opinion. Deeper down there's a little bit of vanilla and tobacco.
T: A long time ago I read some reviews that said the coffee was fading. After having this within a week of the release and now, about 10.5 months later, I whole-heartedly disagree. The coffee and bourbon pretty equally compete for the front-end of this beer. They are both deep in flavor and fairly complex. At the finish there's a little bit of sweetness and small amount of alcohol heat, although I think this has mellowed out quite a bit since the release.
M: Not quite as thick as I remembered/would have liked. Otherwise, perfect level of carbonation and great aftertaste.
D: For a 13% ABV beer this has very high drinkability, and overall is probably my favorite coffee beer. I look forward to trying the 2011 version when it comes out. 1,241 charactersglazeman, Feb 23, 2011

4.72/5  rDev +3.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Poured from a bottle into a goblet.
Appearance: Pours jet black with a dark tan head that goes away completely almost as soon as it is poured.
Smell: Sweet and roasty with some coffee and hot bourbon.
Taste: Starts with a very mild sweetness which yields to coffee and smooth bourbon. The beer is a bit hot in the nose at the end from the bourbon and the coffee is a bit nutty.
Mouthfeel: Smooth and on the thicker side. The carbonation is very mild, which seems appropriate.
Drinkability: This one is very well balanced. The bourbon dominates, but the other flavors come out well. Love it! 595 charactersoline73, Feb 10, 2011
4.63/5  rDev +1.1%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5had a 22oz bottle poured into a tulip glass. Color was a dark deep black with small brown/tannish head that quickly dissappeared. first smell was of sweet bourbon, given some time to rest had notes of roasted expresso some licorice and toasty malt. Taste was that of a nice bourbon with underpinnings of coffee, chocolate and malt. mouthfeel was mildly thick with the feeling of drinking your coffee with a bit of spirits. Overall, it was a nice sipping stout, one that I definitely enjoyed and will gladly drink again. 519 characterspouritdrinkit, Feb 09, 2011

Poured from a 22oz bottle into a tulip-type glass. The small pour yielded very little head and the thin layer of dark caramel foam vanished almost instantly. The body is about as black as you can get...middle of a cave dark.
Bourbon punches you in the nose...POW...then more bourbon hits you in the nose. I cannot pick up any coffee...no matter how I try.
As the nose indicates, bourbon dominates the flavor. You can however, get some of the coffee flavor in the finish before the booziness kicks in. I am not sure if the espresso has faded or not...but it does not play much of a role in this one.
The mouth feel is on the thicker side...slick and oily with very little carbonation.
Man...this is a tasty beer...especially if you are a bourbon fan. I poured a taste for a few non-BAs and their face told me all I needed to know...this isn't for everyone. I had no problem finishing the bottle however! 1,010 charactersmgbickel, Feb 07, 2011

Pours a thick oily black color with a buoyant coffee brown head. Patched film erupts with a collar of lacing around the glass. Swirls of film continue throughout the entire beer.
Super rich nose with coffee drenched in earthy bourbon. Molasses and licorice with roasted malt as well. 
Begins with rich chocolate and espresso. Whole bean coffee alongside vanilla and smooth, sweet bourbon. Roasted malts, slight char, and dark chocolate. Super robust malt backbone laden with slick, oily bourbon soaked with coffee. Oaky boozyness and a smooth yet warm finish. 
Full syrupy sticky body, ultra smooth and soft on the tongue. Drinks insanely well for the abv, excellent flavor and great execution on bal aging once again from GI. I'm not sure which of the bourbon county's I like the best, but this is certainly another awesome creation.
Update 1/26/13 - Each vintage of this beer continues to remain stellar in nearly every attribute. Bumping up the overall score as this is one of the best barrel-aged stouts I've ever had, even after sampling tons of other beers since this original review was posted. 1,172 charactersxnicknj, Feb 06, 2011

A: Poured a black, shiny, oil slick color. From what I remember I didnt see any head form during after pour. 
S: BOURBON! Its in the name after all. Insane amounts of bourbon up front with coffee and vanilla undertones in the back. 
T: BOURBON! Thank you sweet sweet bourbon! This is a real treat. I was worried to Inteligentsia Coffee would overpower this one and place it in the same relm as other coffee stouts. I was wrong. After the bourbon sings and dances its way down your throat you get a very slight taste of coffee and vanilla. 
M: Very nice, perfect carbonation. I can't even imagine how this one will taste after a year or two. 
D: Ehhh amazing drinkability! I could drink this all night and ask for more the next day. I honestly dont think I could get tired of this one 820 charactersvissai, Jan 31, 2011
4.79/5  rDev +4.6%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Shared with my buddy James tonight. Out of my Sierra XXX glass.
A- Pitch black with a light tanish head. It actually made 4 symetrical little swirls in the glass. Nothing too crazy though
S- Everything I love about BCBS. A full nose of sweet bourbon. Dark chocolate, coffee, and dark malt also are very prevalent. There is some heat too.
T- A sweet bourbon malty flavor fills the mouth, and fades to tastes of chocolate and coffee. Finishes with a touch of heat and more sweetness. Caramel, oak, and molassass are there too. The coffee flavor isn't really that noticeable though.
M- Just dances all over the place. The flavor is very well blended, and quite complex for a beer of this nature. It's a little hot still, but it's quite delicious.
D- It's delicious. I keep wanting more and more, despite the high alchohol. I actually think that I like this better than regular bourbon county. 
Needs some more time to mellow, but an excellent beer all around. 962 charactersGfunk720, Jan 29, 2011
4.16/5  rDev -9.2%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.522 oz, bottled in Spring 2010, sampled in December 2010.
 Looks the same as its counterparts: pitch black, thick, and oily with little head. Smells of alcohol, chocolate, coffee. A good aroma but not as delicious as I remembered it to be!
 First sip was very underwhelming considering that the expectations from this beer were high since I have had it fresh. Tastes thin and acidic, and one dimensional. There really is not much to write but for the sake of review, it should be mentioned that this beer is still quite complex with notes of coffee and chocolate being the most prominent ones.
 The body is thinner than what one would expect in a beer of this kind, but drinkability is still very good, and superior to BCS in my opinion, that gets too "hot" once it's warm.
 Still, between Nightstalker, BCS, BCBVS and itself, it was the least favorite at the tasting. 871 characterstewaris, Jan 28, 2011
4.74/5  rDev +3.5%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Look - one finger width very dark mocha head, after a couple sips the head leaves but there is still a ring of head that laces the sides of the glass as I drink. Just link any BCBS variation it is dark as motor oil and looks viscously.
Smell- Huge huge coffee nose then bourbon, and finally some dark fruits figs come to mind.
Taste - Just like in the nose the taste just hits you in the mouth, the bourbon is is there but when you compare the coffee when to the regular it is a lot better balanced.
Mouthfeel - Big viscous mouthfeel that coats the entire mouth but it doesn't linger compared to other RIS.
Drinkability - THis is a sipper but after you finsh it you want more, I couldnt drink this fast but if I could I would drink 2-3 bottles. 749 charactersphisigben, Jan 27, 2011

Finally got around to cracking one of these open. As mentioned in alot of the reviews, right as you oped it up you can smell the burbon really coming through.
A: Pitch black with a small, less than a pinky head that fades away very quickly.
S: Like i said you can still really smell the burbon here, not to much coffee coming thorugh but the funny thing i noticed is after i take a sip and breathe out my nose i smell coffee, but not when smelling out of the glass...strange
T: Personally I think this is still a little hot, not that it is taking away from it, but a little more age on her and i bet it will be a dream becuase even now it is drinking very smooth. im picking up a little to much alcohol for me at the moment but others might not be as bothered by it
M: the mouthfeel is full body, but very smooth 
D: was a slow sipper for me becuase of the up front burbon i was still getting from it but cant wait to try one again when it is a little older becuase i think it is going to be unreal. 1,024 charactersmmtroop1218, Jan 27, 2011
4.44/5  rDev -3.1%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4finally got around to cracking one of these. I have heard the coffee fades quickly, so with almost a year on this i am expecting just a slight bit of coffee. here's the results.
Poured into a new belgium tulip/snifter from a 22oz bomber.
Pours a very very dark, thick viscous motor oil like black color with a small, almost non existent tan head. There is a very evident alcohol residue coming down the sides of the glass after swirling. The aroma is big bold vanilla and mocha aromas. some bitter espresso notes and some bourbon, but much more subdued bourbon than the regular bcbs. This really seems balanced and i can pick up the coffee easily. Great caramel or toffee sweetness on the aromas too. The taste is simply balanced. Really nice coffee integrated into the deep malty and chocolate body. Great bourbon integration and not a smack over the face with the bourbon this time around. Great dry finish on this, though it does have some serious booze coming through on the back end. Not perfect, but near perfection on this bourbon barrel aged stout. Mouthfeel is great to. It has a nice level of carbonation that really works well with this brew as its low carbonated. This is a definite sipper, though it is something that would be better shared than drank on its own, its still easy to put back. Worth seeking out for sure. 1,334 charactersAugustiner719, Jan 17, 2011
4.34/5  rDev -5.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Appearance: I'm going to cut this some slack for the high ABV as it fails to produce much head atop the fudge brown liquid; what head is produced quickly fades to a ringlet and archipelago; legs but not much lace
Smell: More roasty chocolate than coffee, but the oaky bourbon and vanilla aromas dominate
Taste: Chocolate, bourbon, oak and vanilla dominate the tastebuds, up front and after the swallow, with only the vaguest hint of coffee in the finish; a lot of residual sugars in the finish
Mouthfeel: Full bodied and viscous, with low carbonation
Drinkability: A good, make that very good, barrel-aged stout but to my palate, this beer has been over-hyped; perhaps it had more coffee character when first released but that has faded now; I love Intelligentsia's Black Cat roast and am disappointed that it has become lost in the shuffle with this beer
N.B. Checking this one out again in Nov 2015 (2014 bottling) and am finding a lot more coffee in the middle and through the finish; bumped up the scores considerably

4.37/5  rDev -4.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4After doing review #1000, had to follow it up with something decent at #1001 right?? We broke this out last night during the Packers drubbing of the Falcons.
Pours out black, not pitch black, but dark brown aspect to it as well. Vigorous pour will yield a big head, but don't go expecting massive amounts of Brussels lace out of a beer in this style and massivity.
Aroma was great, coffee aspect wasn't as large as expected, vanilla was very large, was thinking I can't imagine how much vanilla is in the vanilla version. Bourbon still upfront and center.
Taste, much like the nose, lots of bourbon and vanilla. Tons of vanilla. I've heard of the coffee fades a little, which is sad that a beer this big lacks the ability to hold its coffee despite the label claiming you can age it up to 5 years. Don't get me wrong, this is an excellent beer, I just thought the coffee was lacking. It was there, but it wasn't any more prominent than the vanilla and bourbon. Mild tobacco aspect to it. Very smooth, not as harsh as the normal black label version of this stuff. Good and chewy, hides the alcohol quite nicely.
Anyways, in summation, lots more vanilla, espresso and cream than expected, less coffee flavor. All melded together to be a decadent beer, regardless of my expectations. 1,284 charactersBeerandraiderfan, Jan 16, 2011
4.49/5  rDev -2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4A: The beer is jet black in color and poured with a thin mocha head that instantly faded away and left a thin ring of bubbles around the collar of the glass. As the beer warms up, it pours with a much larger head that also dissipates.
S: There is an intense aroma of bourbon and alcohol in the nose along with some hints of espresso beans.
T: Like the smell, the bourbon flavors really stand out in the overall taste, although unlike the regular Bourbon County Brand Stout these are balanced to some degree by the coffee and roasted malts. There are also some hints of oak.
M: It feels full-bodied and very viscous on the palate with a low amount of carbonation. There is warming from the alcohol in the finish.
D: This beer is definitely one that needs to be sipped given its strength; the intensity of the aromas and flavors will definitely wake you up. The addition of the coffee flavors makes the beer slightly more drinkable than Bourbon County Brand Stout. 962 charactersmetter98, Jan 16, 2011

A: Pours dark as night with half a finger of tan head that dissipated after a few minutes. Spots of foamy lace cling to the sides of the glass. 
S: Strong notes of vanilla and booze from the barrels, mixed with notes of chocolate and a touch of coffee beans. Very pleasant, but I expected more coffee. 
T: A found the flavor to be very similar to the regular BCBS. There's that distinctive vanilla/bourbon presence right up front, mixed with sweet chocolate and molasses. Notes of dark roasted coffee come through strongly in the finish. Bitter coffee notes begin to come through in the finish as the brew gets to room temperature. Some vague similarities to iced coffee when the brew was still cold. 
M: Quite full and viscous, but surprisingly smooth considering the abv. 
D: Just as tasty as the regular BCBS, with the added dimension of coffee coming through nicely in the finish. 986 charactersMrDanno96, Jan 15, 2011

Pours a motor oil black. It seriously looks thick. No head even after a vigorous pour. No lacing. Nice deep color though.
Aroma is awesome. Lots of coffee and roast. Some toasted sugars. Little bit of raisin.
Taste is amazing. Soo smooth. Sweet with a nice coffee bitterness. Lots of caramel and burnt sugars. Little bit of dark fruits. After dinner desert beer for sure.
Mouthfeel is good. A little thick but not bad. Good carb.
Overall I need to get my hands on some more of this. It's an awesome beer. The appearance needs some work for sure but the taste is so awesome you kind of forget about it. Get some if you can. 663 charactersPeprSprYoFace, Jan 11, 2011

Woody, prominent bourbon, mild roast, gentle-ish boozy warmth, malty sweetness and subtle coffee. 
Malty sweet, woody, bourbon and booze. Coffee is still subtle, but stronger than in the nose. Roasty flavors emerge later and linger, with some mild bitterness.
Low carbonation, pretty warm, very rich full body, thick viscosity. And pretty damned smooth.
Great beer. Coffee character is not strong. I'm told it was stronger when it was fresher. But the bottom line is that this is an amazing beer, and I'm grateful for the opportunity to try it. 652 characterssprucetip, Jan 11, 2011

S - Just like the bottle says. Heavy bourbon and coffee aromas. I think I got a little vanilla out of it as well.
T - Amazing. I am not a fan of the regular Bourbon County at all, its far too boozy for my liking. This, however, is fantastic. The coffee balances the bourbon flavor so nicely. The bourbon is apparent, but not a kick in the face. Heavy coffee and bourbon flavors. Light cream and woody flavors.
M - Thick. My friend described it as "chewable". I am a fan of thick beers though, so this is good for me.
D - I could drink this all night, or at least until I pass out from the 13% abv. I have to say that I was not a fan of this beer when it warmed to room temperature. It really intensified the bourbon and kinda killed the coffee flavor to me. Keep this lightly chilled and it is perfect.
Overall a simply fantastic beer worth trying. 912 charactersoreo, Jan 11, 2011

Upon popping the cap I was greeted with a generous hissing noise and proceeded to pour into a standard pint glass. This baby comes off jet black with absolutely no yeast chunks of haze if you could even see through it. the head was one finger thick and deep mocha colored head than stuck around for quite a while. Viscosity is pretty high and coats the walls of my glass.
Smell:
Orgasmic, beautiful amounts of smooth chocolate, espresso, vanilla, slight ash, and sweet malt, brown sugar, lots of heat alcohol. Oak and whiskey soaked black cherries poke through in the finish.
Taste:
Like taking a hay-maker punch in the face from a Starbucks barista. Huge coffee notes, roast, ash, leathery, and sweet pipe tobacco. Huge bourbon notes and vanilla shine front and center here. Sharp and slightly acidic with loads of oak tannins but not overwhelming. Simply amazing
Drinkability:
Very slow sipping but still delicious. Smooth and like a dessert in a bottle. I wish I had a case or two of this. 1,011 charactersBmoyer0301, Jan 02, 2011

Aroma is dominated by boozy roasted richness; dark bitter chocolate, dried raisins, vinous notes and super high alcohol quality.
Taste is deep, dark, roasty, smooth but bitter. Starts bitter, chocolatey and roasted malt; moves to an alcohol middle with strong burnt fruit notes and continuous dark coco flavors.
A relatively medium bodied beer for its strength, but a nice overall mouthfeel and body. Soft and luminous carbonation.
Overall drinkability is mid level due to overly boozy qualities. 652 charactersNoLiberty, Jan 02, 2011

Pours a deep black with thin bubbly tan head. Nose is coffee and bourbon, hints of vanilla, chocolate. Sip reveals a smooth complex beer; taste is of bourbon and roasted coffee.

4.92/5  rDev +7.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5thanks to nkersten for this one,
My first drink of 2011, and what a great choice it was. bottled on 03/26/10 poured into a cigar city snifter. decided to crack it open before the coffee goes out.
A- Looks exactly like a great stout should, thin hazelnut colored head even after a strong pour. disappears after a few minutes, but remains as a ring around the glass. awesome
s- amazing roasted smell, exactly how i like my regular stouts to smell. a lot of chocolate mixed with coffee, and a heavy hint of regular bcs. 
t- wow this stuff is delicious, the balance is almost perfect and the coffee is present but not overbearing (possible because of the aging) and it definitely complements the bourbon. cant get over how perfect it is. the strong alcohol burn from the regular bcs is really in check by whats left of the coffee.
m- appearance was deceiving in my case, got a very good dose of carbonation in this guy ( or could it be the 13% abv prickling my tongue?) not to syrupy at all.
d- is this stuff really 13% abv?? it goes down amazingly. i want some more!
do your self a favor, if you find this guy definitely pick one up, its worth a try. if you cant find it definitely arrange a trade, i know im glad i did. (lets hope the rest of 2011 continues!) 1,263 charactersKevSal, Jan 01, 2011
4.73/5  rDev +3.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5At the same epic tasting that saw an Abyss and some unreleased Ommegangs popped, I opened one of my bottles of BCBCS. What a fantastic brew. We started with it but it remained the highlight. The regular Bourbon County Brand Stout has led to some ridiculous nights. It also is a bit high on bourbon and a little too bitter for some craft-virgin palates. 
The coffee on this one clearly cuts the bourbon, tempers it, tames it, makes it its prison-bitch. But in the process the coffee gets cut too. The result is velvety smoothness. The appearance is what it is - bourbon black velvet. The smell is subtle when compared to the base beer. It hints at coffee, shows off malts, chocolate, and maintains bourbon. Just not as strong. The taste is an exquisite blend of all the elements in the aroma.
Mouthfeel is full-bodied and thick. Rich. Dessert beer. But lovely. Absolutely the best beer in their series. I just don't want to know the calories in it, because even at 26 proof I want to drink it forever. 
Or at least until I'm dancing to "Walk Like An Egyptian" again. 1,068 charactersafksports, Dec 28, 2010
4.33/5  rDev -5.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured into a little, fancy shaped whiskey glass that's kind of like the buttercup part of a buttercup. It's as opaque and lightly fizzy as regular BCS.
The beer smells and tastes like a much less abrasive version of regular BCS. Or like a BCS that's aged 4-5 years. It's one of the least coffeeish coffee stouts I've ever had, like somehow the black coffee took a rough, bitter RIS and made it sweet and smooth. 
The whiskeyness is barely there, and while it makes the beer more drinkable and more appealing (I assume) to a general audience, it turns out that I actually really enjoy the pain of a regular BCS. 
But judging the beer on its own, it's a pretty remarkable achievement to make a beer this big tastes this smooth. Starts out with a tiny hint of whiskey, with a small burn that lasts throughout the sip. This moves into a milky, chocolately mocha, moving into the rough and lightly sour grain of a medium-strength porter, and this porter aftertaste is all that's left once the beer is swallowed. 
Very good, and definitely worth trying, but I'd honestly prefer a regular BCS. 1,091 charactersmynie, Dec 25, 2010
4.37/5  rDev -4.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 422oz. bottle into tulip snifter.
Pours black with a foamy tan head that dissipates to form a thin ring around the edge of the glass.
The bourbon is still the most pronounced aspect, as in the regular BCBS. There are definite notes of coffee blended with roasted malts, though I was hoping to see the coffee a bit stronger. There is the faintest touch of vanilla coming from the oak.
The bourbon is heavy upfront, but as it warms it does give way to coffee and sweet oaky-vanilla flavors in the finish. 
The mouthfeel is full bodied, smooth and creamy with fairly active carbonation. There is quite a bit of boozy heat.
The 13% ABV is a bit more noticeable and hot than I found in the regular BCBS. Though as it warms, it really becomes more balanced and enjoyable. 769 charactersvkv822, Dec 22, 2010

s: decadent comes to mind - big dark chocolate hits first with smooth waves of oak and bourbon following closely behind, the espresso is tempered by and well-blended with the roasted malt load, heavy chocolate cake, rich black licorice, heavy toffee sugars, monstrously aromatic but incredibly smooth for such a big, powerful ale
m: carbonation light, only barely perceptible, with a full, deliciously viscous body
t: currents of dark chocolate and licorice accompany perfectly implemented bourbon-oak flavors, the espresso adds a nice touch - but seems partially absorbed by the general hugeness of the stout, dense chocolate cake, heavily caramelized sugars, thick and luscious with creamy roasted flavors and smooth bourbon, love it

A: Black with tan head, low carbonation. Looks delightful.
S: Excellent. Booze, coffee of course, chocolate and vanilla. A lovely smell for sure.
T: Wow. Follows the nose pretty closely, but the coffee is pretty subdued which is a little surprising. Chocolate comes through nicely. Vanilla from the bourbon aging is amazing.
M: Coats the mouth. Velvety. A little burn from the alcohol. 
D: If not for the 13% ABV, one could drink this all night. It's amazing.

Bottled in March of this year.
22oz bottle, shared with my wife. Poured my allotment into a snifter. Pours out gluggingly, a pure evil-black. A thin tan head rests atop, then disappears quickly. Big espresso notes in the nose. Also notes of vanilla, bourbon, oak, and mild fruit tones. Aromatic bounty.
Pure silk as this one is sipped. Thick coating of the palate. Warming all the way to the finish. The coffee isn't as pronounced as I would like in flavor, but as I've read, this may have faded over the last 8 months?? Too bad. Still some hints of it, but not as bold. Lots of creamy milk chocolate, huge roasted notes. Some oak and vanilla tannins. The bourbon is also tamed a bit, which is fine by me. The original of this is too boozy for me, but this one comes across more balanced. I really enjoyed this one. Glad I have another to sit on for awhile. Interested to see how this one develops. 1,022 charactersOnenote81, Dec 09, 2010

A - Pours like motor oil. Thick black with slight caramel colored head.
S - Smells subtly of bourbon with strong coffee tones. Also some hints of chocolate. Phenomenal smell.
T - Initial taste is fairly alcoholic, fades quickly to a strong coffee taste with some malt taste as well. Eventually fades to a dark chocolate taste. 
M - Fairly light-bodied compared with the pour. Still somewhat syrupy.
D - Much more carbonated than how it poured, making it very easy to enjoy. 535 charactersMarkIntihar, Dec 07, 2010

The aroma is sweet and roasted like all stouts but the big aroma is oak and bourbon with a coffee backing.

4.22/5  rDev -7.9%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Yum. Thick black lucious pour. No light passes through this beer. Very, very fast fading head...to nothing. Aroma is layered and complex. Vanilla, bourbon, oak, and chocolate. No coffee comes through in the nose. The flavor is similar, duh, to the regular bourbon county. Tons of sweet malts, bourbon and vanilla....but then at the end, wham espresso on the finish. A great finish, cleans up the beer alot. Thick and chewy, a bit hot, but then the hotness fades when coffee kicks in. This is a sipper for sure but so good.
edit: just wanted to say I returned to this bottle which I corked several days ago. For some reason the coffee flavor and aroma is much more pronounced now. Real nice. 691 characterspmlondrigan, Nov 29, 2010
4.32/5  rDev -5.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4The bomber that keeps on giving. Bottled 3/26/10, consumed today. $12.99+tax.
[L] Pour is viscous and black. Like any other BCS, this has a motor oil look. Have to be a little rough with this one to get a few moments of head. Khaki/brown bubbles. A very bright l.e.d. only shines a fleck of red through the body. Otherwise, this is quite impenetrable. This beer wants to leave some lacing, but is sucked back into the glass before it gets a chance to dry.
[S] Wet bourbony oak is most dominant, to boot, with a spirity vanilla. Never in a horrible fashion. I insist on LETTING THIS WARM UP! OR, drink at cellar temp to really release the gorgeous nose this one has to offer. Sweet powdered espresso, roasted beans, french vanilla creamer, molasses, with a very passable vinous aspect. Smells like standing in front of a Gloria Jean's in the mall. {If those still exist.) Very well done, though I can't help but wonder how much more intense the coffee aromas were fresh, than at 8 months old.
[T] Again, there is no forgetting about the bourbon aspect of this beer. Coffee remains fresh in the taste. The vanilla, spirit, oaky tannins, and roast coffee aspects play very well. Intricate. A spirity finish mingles with the espresso on end. Nice improvement on BCS. 
[F] This is a heavy-hitting beer with a slick and heavy mouth. I have tasted many sour, raw, hot tasting BBA beers, yet BCS, even fresh, seems to lean toward the spectrum of mellow and balanced for the style. Apprpriate for what it is. No bother. Since this isn't a barrel category
[D] A bomber for one would more than suffice for the evening. For a barrel aged Imperial Stout, this is a sipper. But I thoroughly enjoyed it. 1,693 characters3FaveryRogue, Nov 28, 2010
4.61/5  rDev +0.7%look: 3 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to cmrillo for this one! 2010 Vintage. 22oz brown glass pry-top. Bottled on 03/../10. Opened at 56 degrees (cellar temp).
Appearance: Pours a thick, oily black. Some thin cola-like dark tan head that leaves no trace.
Nose: Intensely earthy/foresty/mossy. Very dark roasted coffee, big thick sticky black vanilla beans, cocoa powder, tree bark, forest floor, dry leaves, bitter-smelling black malt, and more coffee. Really complex and intense nose. It's almost pungent, really. I like it but it's definitely engaging and commands attention and thought.
Palate: Slick and fat with alcohol, but it's round not prickly. Creamy espresso flavors, vanilla beans, vanilla extract, sweet oak (not bitter char). The bourbon commands the palate and the coffee plays a wonderful supporting role. Tastes a lot like imported cofffee hard candies (I think from Italy?...) Sweet and round mouthfeel like the original with great integration of the coffee.
Notes: I didn't think this beer could be as good as the original BCBS, but it turns out it is really friggin' awesome. I'm a tough critic on coffee beers, usually finding them acidic or having "integration" problems. But this, this right here, is epic. KBS has nothing on this beer! 1,232 charactersSFLpunk, Nov 23, 2010
4.8/5  rDev +4.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Pours into my snifter with little to no head forming. This is one of those beers that you can tell the thickness from looking at it. The darkest brown you can get before being black. No much in the way of lacing. A rather glossy looking beer.
Aroma is quite nice. Bourbon, vanilla, deep dark malts. Not sure I would detect coffee if I didn't know it was that version. The slightest hint of alcohol at the end.
Certainly no surprise that I love this since love the base beer. The combination of dark roasted malts, the bourbon and the slight vanilla is just wonderful. I think the coffee adds a subtle depth to the flavor and an additional roasted note at the end. It's not coffee in your face and it almost just hits you within the wonderful aftertaste. Very subtle and very well done. While there certainly a warming effect from the alcohol, this is not hot. It's just delicious.
Full bodied, wonderful and silky. Just a prick or two of carbonation. 
If it weren't for the abv I could drink this all night long. This is a wonderful beer and I am quite happy I've had the opportunity to enjoy it. Excellent! 1,111 charactersReagan1984, Nov 21, 2010

This beer has such a dark fruit aroma with notes of chocolate, bourbon, and coffee. 
The flavor is great. It is like the coffee added the bitterness to start to balance out Bourbon County. Plums, raisons, bourbon, chocolate, and coffee. 
The mouthfeel is thick and rich. The flavors coat your mouth and seem to never let go. While the coffee does start to balance out this beer it is still a sipper. 457 charactersJoePat, Nov 21, 2010

4.32/5  rDev -5.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Review based on notes taken August 28, 2010
I managed to pick up the last bottle that a favorite local store had in stock and wanted to wait for a special occasion to drink it. I ended up drinking it the night I moved into my new apartment. 
Poured into a pint glass this is dark and oily looking, very appealing. A finger and of light brown head which does not stick around. Smells dark and rich, sweet and roasted with a noticeable, but not defining aroma of coffee. I imaging that in the months since bottling the coffee has settled a bit. Taste is bourbon sweet, vanilla and espresso. Mouthfeel is smooth with a tingling booziness on the tongue. All things considered, I find this very drinkable for the style. 
I would say that this is not better or worse than regular BCBS, but different. 797 charactersrobobor, Nov 17, 2010
4.67/5  rDev +2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Had it fresh and with about 7 months on it, this review is for the 7 month old version.
Appearence- Dark chocolate color with a rich dark chocolate head.
Smell- Bourbon and coffee, think Irish coffee. Not much else to say except thank god they used Intelligentsia beans.
Taste- The bourbon is rich in the flavor and smooths out the heaviness of the stout and coffee in an indulgent flavor assault on the palate. This is a beer that I think got better with some age and is excellent right around now-ish.
Mouth- Thick but not overbearing.
Drink- For a version of BCBS this is one of the most drinkable, excepting the vanilla.
Honestly this one is getting better and better, I don't know where the peak will be but I can't imagine it is too far away. Drink'em if you got 'em. 779 characterscadaugherty, Nov 15, 2010
4.47/5  rDev -2.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A 22 oz. bottle, one of 3 received at various times (not sure whom to give the credit, so...) over recent months. Poured to a snifter at a slightly cooler than cellar temp (30 minutes in the fridge). Consumed a few weeks back, in mid-October, so this is reviewed from notes.
Glowering vermillion label (2010 Edition) - Made with Intelligentsia Black Cat Espresso. 'Develops for up to 5 years in the bottle'. Dated 03/26/10.
A: Absolutely black, light stand no chance of cutting through. A half-finger of cinnamon-colored cream crowns the pour, winnowing to a few smoky swirls and a slim ring. A few snaking carbonation streams wriggle up the sides. Slick, glistening lace in delicate bands.
S: Big aroma: a coffee roast laced with cream and sugar. Vanilla, dark fruit and a notable sweet bourbon. Chocolate represents with some earthy mustiness, kinda ashy.
T: It's the same sublime Bourbon County Stout I've loved over the years - filled with chocolate, pit/berry fruit and (of course) barrels of bourbon - but now with an extra rich darkness of roasted coffee beans. It's an explosion of flavors that work exceedingly well together - although I have to still favor the original, if just by THAT much [holds thumb and forefinger ever so slightly apart]. Lasting cocoa/java bitterness in the finish. Yum.
M: Thick and velvety, full-bodied but wonderfully smooth after an initial gurgle of carbonation. Sure there's fusel warmth, but nothing so blatant as to diminish the score more than a slight nick. A fine, fuzzy-feeling graininess holds on teeth and tongue.
D: What a terrific brew, very nice now and (I hope) able to mature over the years. I have a spot picked out in the cellar, no worries. Pretty boozy now, and at 13% I don't expect that to taper off all that much. If you like bourbon AND coffee in your Imperial Stout, seek this one out. 1,853 charactersmsubulldog25, Nov 11, 2010
4.72/5  rDev +3.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Serving glass: Poured from bomber into Snifter.
Appearance: Almost black with thin brown head and light lacing.
Smell: Booze, bourbon, coffee, chocolate, licorice and molasses.
Taste: Tastes like chocolate covered espresso beans that have been soaked in bourbon. The chocolate and coffee are augmented by molasses, anise, roasted barley and a big blast of alcohol. Tastes like a less boozy and bourbony version of the standard Bourbon County, with just a dash more coffee.
Feel: Ridiculously smooth and creamy with low carbonation and a nice warming finish.
Drinlability: Somehow the addition of coffee tempered this beer and made it even better. Just a perfect way to end a night. Superb. 694 charactersbsp77, Nov 11, 2010

A - Pours with a finger of tan foam that settles to a thin ring, leaving behind no lace. Black body with a hint of brown at the fringes. Looks like BCS.
S - Utterly insane coffee and espresso flavor. There's a touch of vanilla, bourbon, and roasted malt in the periphery, but this is a total coffee bomb. The coffee aroma is delicious too, and pops without being overly astringent - you can tell this is good stuff.
T - The taste is quite similar but didn't quite live up to the aroma. Big coffee mixed with vanilla, roasted malts, some earthy barrel, and a bitter espresso finish.
M - Smooth, full body, lower carbonation, finishes a bit sticky. Surprisingly low tannic character for a BCS variant.
D - This was awesome. I just sat and smelled my glass in a daze until I realized I had to use the rest of my tickets. It was very easy to put down 4oz of this one. I think this test batch is an improvement on the bottled version and I hope this is what they use in 2011. 1,050 charactersMasterSki, Nov 10, 2010

4.72/5  rDev +3.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5This review is for the Bosque Lya Blend version: Still made with coffee from our neighbors at Intelligentsia, but this small batch blend is made with beans from the Bosque Lya farm in El Salvador rather than the Black Cat Espresso we used in our bottled version of this beer from early 2010.
Pours a pitch black, thick viscous liquid with a small tan ring. Head is very creamy and sits at the edge of the glass for the remainder of the beer. Smell is amazing - fresh roasted coffee, sweet bourbon and vanilla, some dark roasted malt undertones. Taste is earthy fresh coffee, coffee bitterness that balances the sweet vanilla and bourbon flavors that dominate the standard version of this beer. Milk chocolate, a hint of coconut, very light oak, and a touch of alcohol round this one out. Mouthfeel is spot on - thick and chewy, coating but not cloyingly sweet. Light carbonation. Drinkability on this beer is perfect for an imperial stout. The balance of coffee and bourbon makes me want to get as much of this as possible. Sadly, I am sure the coffee freshness wont last. I have always thought KBS was overrated due to its lack of body - this is what it should be. Best beer of the night for me. 1,197 charactersnkersten, Nov 08, 2010

Aroma is slight with the coffee and bourbon, good full roasted malt aroma with a slight inhale on the sip.
The taste is exceptional because the muted coffee flavors restricts the bourbon flavor, preventing it from overwhelming the other flavors. There isn't much by way of subtlty, each of the predominent flavors (coffee, bourbon, malt) is there and divides up the palate nicely.
Silky mouthfeel, not very sticky. Light on carbonation that doesn't prevent this from being a full mouthfeel.

Nose is heavy on the bourbon. As others have said, it seems that the coffee has faded. There are still minor hints of coffee, but they are very minimal for a stout with coffee in the name. There are also some notes of chocolate and roasted malts.
Just like the nose, the taste is heavy on the bourbon and light on the coffee. Some chocolate and dark fruits hit the tongue momentarily before it finishes warm and boozy.
Mouth feel is smooth and sexy. Medium-heavy body with average carbonation. An awesome tasting beer, but I regret not trying it when it was fresh to fully appreciate the coffee flavors, which have faded to just about nothing. Still a bit on the hot side...since the coffee is already gone, sitting on this for another few years would only allow the bourbon heat to blend a little better. 942 charactersratedz, Nov 03, 2010

Aromatics: amazing. Mix of whiskey and coffee flow freely from the glass, ....going in close, now...dark chocolate and molasses, dark rum, a bit of brandy, hint of vanilla, coated in bourbon, drizzled with espresso. Heaven.
Drinking it...warming, boozy, medium-bodied, rich and luxurious. Wonderful mix of flavors, dark and delicious, earthy, sweetness, rum and molasses, swirl of espresso, bourbon burbling beneath. Little bit of alcohol burn, in here, too. 
Long finish, full flowering flavor, ...but not the end all/ be all it's been hyped as. Sorry. There's too much whiskey, not enough coffee, and not enough stout.

M: well-carbonated, has a bit of frothiness to it rather than a big slickness i'd expect in a ba ris.
D: this seems like it will definitely improve with age, the bourbon and alcohol should subside allowing the other flavors to come through more.
had this again side by side with the regular, vanilla, and rare BCS, and this one stood out as the best. it had the most head, a more vanilla-ey and softer (less boozy) aroma, and best mouthfeel (more co2) of the bunch. 761 charactersMrMcGibblets, Oct 24, 2010
4.47/5  rDev -2.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Bottle courtesy of hoppymcgee served in my Old Stock snifter. Pours one shade shy of black with no head, just a thin band and some small dollops of lacing dispersed across the surface. Some lacing, but weak legs. Nose reveals booze, molasses and brown sugar - it just smells like a sweet malt bomb. Taste expresses booze, bourbon, vanilla and coffee notes. As the brew warms, the coffee character becomes more suggestive of coffee grounds. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with a carbonation that starts out as being just short of lively, but dissipates nicely, resulting in a pleasant, silky mouthfeel. This is a truly exceptional beer. Tasty and quite drinkable with a well-hidden abv. The coffee element really lends itself nicely to this beer and has really piqued my interest about the other variations to the Bourbon County base. 829 charactersJwale73, Oct 24, 2010
3.64/5  rDev -20.5%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 2Bottled on date of 3/25/2010.
Pours a dark black color with hardly any head and no lacing, appears slightly thick but doesn't leave any legs on the glass, can see some reddish/brown tints along the edges when held up to the light.
Smell is overwhelmingly bourbon with a good strong coffee presence, slight chocolate presence but certainly not a key player in the aroma.
Taste is quite hot, not surprising considering it's from Goose Island, their regular BCS even after a few years of age tends to still be hot, the dark roasted malt comes through in the taste more than it did in the aroma, the bourbon is rather strong but the coffee helps to soothe it a bit by adding some bitterness on the tongue.
Says on the bottle that it will continue to develop for 5 years, I'd recommend sticking to that advise because in 5 years it will be much better. I'd say it took me about 4 hours to drink the entire bottle because this beer is such a sipper, probably broke my previous record from Darkness. 996 charactersdeltatauhobbit, Oct 17, 2010
4.05/5  rDev -11.6%look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Thanks to Bendurgin for providing this "tick!" Poured into my chalice. Pitch black, with a bit of tan head that all but disappears.
Smells like slightly chocolatey bourbon. A hint of bitter char flavor is detected from the coffee.
The taste is slightly sweet and boozy up front. The sweetness lasts until the finish as well. The coffee flavor is nicely balanced and complements the sweet malts nicely. A hint of vanilla is also noticed as I continue sipping.
This is a big, thick stout; making it nice for sipping. Not much carbonation and the mouthfeel isn't as creamy as I'd like. Still good body though.
Decent drinkability for this monster stout. Glad to have tried it. 677 charactersandrewinski1, Oct 16, 2010
4.24/5  rDev -7.4%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.5Got this in an EXTRA BOX thanks to the incredibly generous Translucent. Poured into a tulip. The beer is black, with very thin layer of head that dissipates into thin lacing. This however simply looks rich. Smell that bourbon! The nose is right up front with a big bourbon, hints of caramel and vanilla and a rich aroma of bitter espresso. The smell is very balanced, the bourbon and the coffee have really compliment one another, still not overpowering anything and letting other aromas shine through. The taste follows the smell wonderfully, starts nicely with bourbon and finishes with a nice bitter coffee flavor. Dark malts, caramel, oak and vanilla entwine themselves in the mix. The mouthfeel is heavy and chewy with a silky texture and subtle carbonation. A bit of a sipper, but certainly something I would enjoy again. I think I like this better than the regular version. 880 charactersBendurgin, Oct 16, 2010
4.87/5  rDev +6.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to Grittymug for sharing this want with me.
We poured the bomber into large snifters and were greeted with a finger worth of tan head that settled down quickly to a wisp of film. However with a swirl of the glass it would easily come back. The body was a typical black stout but that was all that was typical of this stout.
The first think that was really pronounced to me was the great coffee aromas. It was better than any Starbucks coffee I had. We all know coffee is a dominate aroma to overcome especially this one but I did get a slight vanilla note there as well. 
The flavors were out of this world, by far the best coffee stout I ever have experienced to date. I think this one will set the bar. I came of like a good French vanilla roast. With the hint of Madagascar vanilla to it. The alcohol was well hidden but felt after. The body of the brew was thick and full a very light carbonation so it even felt like a good coffee only colder than I drink.
This I a great brew the one snifter was plenty for me but I will say I wanted more. A great stout but I even enjoy the bourbon one Goose Island produces so it wasn't a hard sell for me. 1,157 charactersjoepais, Oct 15, 2010

First sip, knew this was top tier. Luscious coffee! Rich, bitter coffee, vanilla and cocoa, bourbon galore. What Angel's Share Coffee would be. Highly delicious. 
Viscous yet vicious. Strong alcohol presence, could use aging. Guessing around 13-14% and was right. Beer is hot. Finishing an entire bottle quite a manly task.
This is a highly delicious, deep and complex beer. 593 charactersptykozoon, Oct 13, 2010

4.17/5  rDev -9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Reviewed from notes on 10/3/10. Thanks you, TCGoalie, for procuring this highly thought of beer for me. 
A: I poured a little more than half of a bomber into my giant snifter, which results in a two finger, dark brown, mocha head. The body is black with a mocha twinge. The head sizzles off quickly and leaves a spotty haze on top with a dark khaki ring around the glass. It appears to be pretty heavily carbonated judging by the tumult of hazy bubbles on the top of the beer. A vigorous swirl of the glass leaves a viscous film on the the snifter, but no lacing. 
S: A huge, heavy aroma of bourbon, dark chocolate, molasses, anise, hearty rye bread, and, yes, rather acidic coffee is alive within this beer. Some background smells of brown sugar, caraway, toffee, and charred marshmallow are also evident to my nose.
T: The sweeter edge of bourbon is the dominant taste on my palate at first and pairs with distinct molasses, brown sugar, and anise flavors. Gradually the more bitter flavors of dark chocolate and espresso wash away some of the sweetness, but in the end, I would say that the sweeter flavors (especially the anise and bourbon) win the day. I think I would prefer a little more impactful coffee flavor from a coffee stout. Perhaps that has worn off a bit with the 6 plus months of age that this bottle has on it. 
M: The feel is very full bodied and coating on my palate. The bourbon presence really stings the sides of my mouth, while the bitter flavors sit on the flat of my tongue and percolate. 
D: This is a big, bad mofo that I will certainly enjoy tasting again. However, I do think the sweeter flavors of the beer overpower the bitterness a bit too much. I will be quite interested to see how more age affects the taste. 1,750 charactersTCHopCraver, Oct 05, 2010
3.67/5  rDev -19.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 2.5Pours a thick oily black with a large tan cream head. 
Smell of strong booziness of whiskey and dark malt, tobacco and roasted malts mixed with sugar. 
Taste of coffee, boozy whiskey of course (thats why they put it in there right?) vanilla, roasted caramel, thick syrupy sugar and malt flavors intermix to create a thick viscous flavored RIS. All said, this is what RIS's are supposed to be built like, I just prefer a slightly less boozy presentation. At 13%, the booze is going to rear its head, unfortunately its just not my style. 
Drinkability went down greatly in my book due to the booze flavor factor and I found the carbonation slightly disappointing in that it was relatively flat. Luckily, I do not think that I need to try the vanilla BCS , the Coffee BCS, and whatever other BCS comes out after I post this. Its not a bad beer at all, just not my favorite RIS. 
I would recommend only opening one of these when another person is around. 955 charactersalpinebryant, Sep 30, 2010

4.75/5  rDev +3.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Huge shoutout to Kegatron for graciously sending me a bottle. I decided to enjoy it tonight, on my Birthday, for a special treat.
Presented in a snifter at 50 degrees. Midnight black body topped by a one finger width dark tan creamy looking head. Dissipates down into a ring fairly quick, but that ring retains well. Some lacing here, but it's of the dissapearing variety, likely due to the strength of the beer. Looks thick and it's begging me to take a sip.
The smell is really good and reminds me very much of the original BCS. Pretty huge bourbon aroma here, massive amounts of vanilla, char, tobacco leaf, chocolate, yogurt covered raisins and alcoholic cherry. Slight hints of roast and coffee manage to squeak through, but ideally I'd like them to be a little more present for a perfect score. Still, quite huge and impressive.
First flavor is huge vanilla, of the creamy variety, sort of like rich vanilla ice cream. Beyond that, dark caramel hits hard and intermingles with chocolate covered raisins, tobacco, and cherries. Lingering in the pre-swallow phase is some definite coffee and roast. More of it than in the smell. A little bit of spice from the alcohol or maybe the hops rounds things off. What a beer.
Can't improve the mouthfeel. Perfect. Big and chewy, creamy, yet slick at the same time. Completely coats the mouth and persists long after a swallow. Perfect light carbonation that stimulates it just enough. Head texture is as fine as the creamy head of an espresso shot.
Drinkability... Well, this is about as subjective a category you can get when it comes to judging a beer like this. It's gigantic, ridiculously rich, has tons of bourbon flavor, high in alcohol, and you can taste the alcohol. In that regard, it can be somewhat of a challenge to drink quickly, but then that's not the point. The point is to enjoy this beer slowly over the course of an hour or two, lingering and appreciating every sip. In that regard, it makes perfect sense and has very good drinkability. Although, I would suggest finding a special friend when you crack yours. I have a feeling I am going to be quite inebriated by the time this bottle is empty. 2,165 charactersBubba83, Sep 28, 2010
4/5  rDev -12.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4It's exactly 6 months after the bottling date of 3/26/10 so I thought it was a great time to review this beer. Poured from a 22oz. bomber into a Trois Pistoles goblet.
A: Dark brown/black with a nice swirly dark tan head that subsides into a ring on the side of the glass.
S: Bourbon (and lots of it), vanilla, smoke, oak, and swiss chocolate.
T: The coffee has worn off a little bit, but is still present and completely necessary as it provides the bitterness this beer needs. The flavors have nicely mingled together - bourbon, maple, chocolate - and in my opinion is much better tasting than when I had it fresh.
M: No problems with the carbonation holding up thus far. A nice creamy texture adds to the beer and, again, is completely necessary to offset the sweetness of this beer.
D: The sweetness gets at me more than the booziness does.
Overall, cool to have tried this a half year later to the day, and am excited to see how this beer develops (for 5 years in the bottle according to GI). 1,002 charactershoppymcgee, Sep 27, 2010

Mouthfeel is nice and thick with good drinkability. 342 charactersDovaliHops, Sep 26, 2010
4.7/5  rDev +2.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5It pours black; a deep rich color; it was impenetrable by light. The body alone looks the part; very menacing. Only a smallish beige head formed on a harder than normal pour but that should be expected considering the barrel aging and high ABV. No subsequent lacing at all (and my glass was clean), however a small ring of foam did last the entire consumption. The appearance is exactly what one would expect. It's eye-candy for beer geeks.
I am utterly amazed that so much coffee aroma shines through in the nose. BC Stout is a beast of a beer. I regularly tell customers that it is the most robust beer available in Nebraska (on a regular basis). I digress... once I start deconstructing the nose oak, bourbon, vanilla, cherries, chocolate, licorice and a note of brandy soaked raisins join the espresso party. I love the cherry aroma in the bouquet; it gives the nose some extra depth and complexity. Somehow, the bourbon is secondary to the coffee... if not secondary it is extremely well-balanced for a 13% ABV imperial stout (that is bourbon barrel aged with coffee). I am so impressed with the complexity of the nose. Robust but not hot, complex but every note sings clearly. It might not be the "best" smelling beer I have ever stuck under my beak but it sure was memorable.
The palate shows as much coffee as the nose did which is a fantastic accomplishment. Again, BC Stout is bourbon-flavor heavy, it is a very robust beer that can quickly overwhelm the palate... in a good way. The addition of coffee mellows the flavors, by comparison, and adds complexity and depth. Bourbon, coffee (espresso), chocolate and cherries provide the bulk of the characteristics. The palate is warm and boozy, clearly this beer is still young but I don't find it raw. The finish flashes "Imperial Stout" maltiness with a wonderful blast of espresso and cherry. I am so impressed with the absolute robustness of the flavors and yet I am not being overwhelmed. Not to overstate this beer but for what it is, for how strong it is, for how robust and raw it is... I must say, this beer is amazingly drinkable. 
Slightly oily mouthfeel (which is typical of BC Stout); full in body, low carbonation; the mouthfeel is ideal for this beer. Sip & savor is the name of the game. 
As the beer warms the nose livens up, gets boozier, hotter... rawer... more complex even (is that possible?). As does the palate... rich, raw but so damn fun to drink. This beer is great right now but it can only get better with age. Stored properly I am betting this beer has 5 or 7 years easy of maturity before it peaks. There were high expectations about this beer and they were met in spades. Goose Island tinkered with BC Stout and lived to tell about it. This beer is an absolute must try. Get a friend because it is 22 ounces of one BIG beer. Highly recommended. 2,836 charactersbditty187, Sep 24, 2010

The flavor is roasty and has a fair bit of dark chocolate, some maple syrup, some bourbon, and tons of coffee fruity earthy coffee, the booze is there but it's fairly well concealed.

From a bomber into a snifter. 
Vintage: 2010
Note: Tasted directly after Bourbon County Stout. 
APPEARANCE: Pours out black, but not quite pitch black. The pour produces a cascading ½ finger mocha colored head that magically appears out of nowhere. Jet black body with no real noticeable carbonation. Head quickly fades to nothing and a ring around the edges of the glass. A slight ring remains until the end and leaves no lacing. Looks exactly the same as Bourbon County. 
SMELL: Burnt coffee beans lead the way, then some roasted malts, lots of bourbon, vanilla and wood notes. Quite bold as well. Definitely the regular Bourbon County with added coffee beans. 
TASTE: Same deal as the nose. Lots of bourbon again, vanilla and oak notes, as well as some roasted barley. The roasted coffee beans overlap everything and tie it all together nicely. Finishes with some bitter chocolate, vanilla and bourbon notes, as well as a long bourbon and bitter coffee led aftertaste. Very bold flavors here, and a bit of well-placed heat at the end. The coffee plays a nice role, meshing well with the regular Bourbon County. 
PALATE: Like the regular Bourbon County, the body is too thin and light for the style. It's somewhat airy on the palate as well. Semi-creamy on the palate, goes down fine but has as delayed scratch and burn at the finish. Ends relatively mouth-coating. A little less abrasive than the normal version, but still too thin and light. 
OVERALL: A nice variant of the Bourbon County Brand Stout. The coffee flavors mesh well with the regular base brew without dominating or overpowering in any way. Like the regular version, a heavier palate would perhaps help push things over the top, but that is a small critique on what is otherwise a fantastic beer. One worth checking out if you get the chance. Thanks again guys for sending me some of this brew! 1,958 charactersJeffo, Sep 22, 2010

Heavy reds, burnt oranges, and oily browns meld elegantly into an ink-like liquid in my snifter. The head is mimicking a chocolate mousse in color a stature. Something special about this one
S: the nose is gargantuan. Intensely oiled coffee beans and roasted malts, loads of chocolate, and spicy bourbon. Even more impressive is the toasted sugary coconut whiff gracing every sniff. These smells are incredibly bold and remain rounded. Some soft oak/wood notes drifts in as well...amazing
T: murky coffee flavors, chocolate/dark cocoa, and bourbon hold strong. This beer is sheer wonder. As it warms the flavors are rowdy and richer. Malts are tougher and more complex on the tongue. They taste as if they are dusted with malt powder and drizzled with chocolate, very smooth and decadently rich. Bourbon unlocks spicy, cherry, smokey, and molasses. I am aghast at how good
M: dangerously creamy and feels nowhere near the power indicated on the label. Full and heavy with luxurious character

The nose sounds like a mocha factory. Holy smokes. I have mine in a snifter, and that may play a big factor but wow is this nose intense. Slight hoppiness is evident on the nose as well. Hot bourbon notes intermingle with all of the above.
First taste in the mouth is a blast of chocolate and coffee, perhaps some dark cherries...then the hops hit ya, then you swallow and this intense bitter/sweet coffee/cocoa thing slams you and you look at your friend who just took his first sip too and go: "WHOA!" Don't forget about the bourbon flavor. The oak is huge too.
Mouthfeel: I can't really describe it. Its a dash of everything good you'd ever want in a beer.
Drinkability: I defy you not to like this beer. 841 charactersmidnite2sixman, Sep 22, 2010
4.67/5  rDev +2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I got to try this at ACBF and damn was it good! I finally got the nerve to crack one of my two bottles.
A pour as dark as the crude in the gulf comes sliding out of the mouth of the bottle. A slow pour as it comes out the consistency of molasses. A light fizzy dark head forms, but seems to get drunk before it can even enjoy the beer and fades away, but not before it creates some interesting swirls in the glass, like a drunk frat boy trying to walk home. Lacing?! No lacing necessary and the beer itself forms a thick syrupy layer on the glass, so thick that legs don't even form. It just sticks there and the entire round splash slowly recedes down the sides. It's so dark that when I splash it on the side to see the non-existent leg, it stains the glass a dark brown. I can still see the splashes a minute later. I still would have liked a bit more head and it would have put the appearance to a 4.5.
Ah the aromas coming from this make my nostrils dance in a whimsical fashion. First comes the roasted malts, lots of nice roasted aromas, fresh roasted coffee, earthy roasty coffee beans blended with a medium roast fruity coffee. The chocolate speaks notes of its own, with hints of dark chocolate, bakers chocolate, light cocoa nibs even. This is the kind of chocolate you would see in a swiss chocolate store on the top shelf that makes you blush as it dissolves in your mouth. Some light vanilla and caramel add a nice little touch to it, bringing more of that creamy delicious dark aromas out. Then of course there is the bourbon and oak. It's not too predominant, perhaps a little more in the background than KBS, but definitely making it's own story well known. A nice bourbony aroma with hints of charred oak, and caramelized barrel. I get a hint of a boozy aroma too, but nothing near the 13% it actually brings. 
ANd of course, the taste. The thick wave gushes over my tongue, creating a barrier of thick luscious beer over the pours of my tongue. I won't be able to taste anything else for hours now as it fills every taste bud and pour in my mouth. Very thick and rich, again loaded with malts. Initially comes the coffee and roasted malts again. Some nice dark roasted barley, with fresh roasted coffee beans, and again blended with a medium fruity brewed coffee as well. Both lighter than I expected, but plenty to go around. Behind that comes plenty of chocolate as well. Again this comes right out with rich cocoa nibs, some baker's chocolate, a little bit of a dark chocolate with a smooth rich creamy center. It has a chocolate flavor that reminds me a lot of those Lindt Chocolate balls. Some sweet syrupy flavors reach the outer flavor eventually, bringing a little caramel, some molasses and even a little vanilla. WIth all the roasted malts and dark malts I was expecting a lot more minerality and salty flavors, but there are none to be found. This is as smooth as a baby nun's butt. There is a slight bitterness, a light earthy and mild hop with some from the bitterness coming from the roast, but not much bitterness at all. It also doesn't bring a lot of boozy taste either, it definitely has some, and while I'm leaving it to fester on my tongue for a few minutes writing this review, it starts to tingle some, but nothing like the 13% it actually packs. It also has a faint herbal and grassy hop flavor I believe, which also gives it a slight fluffy feel and taste. It finishes with a long lingering sticky taste, lots more syrupy flavors that never leave since they coated my mouth, and I'm sure stained it like it did to the glass. A long lingering chocolate too, which definitely takes the front ground now over the coffee and roast and other sweet things.
The mouth is nice and thick, super rich and syrupy, luscious, with a decent carbonation for the style. It makes me realize that that song "Chocolate Rain" was actually about.
The drinkability is surprisingly well for the what the beer actually is. It drinks more like a 9% beer not 13%, and despite that it coats the mouth it goes down smooth and only leaves very nice flavors in the mouth. The other thing that helped a lot was the minerality, or lack thereof. In a beer of this darkness and caliber I would have expected the minerality and salty briny flavors to run rampant, but this drinks so smooth without even a hint of that flavor. 
Ah so delicious, def one of my fav beers now. Just wish I could have gotten more of it. I'll sit on my last bottle for a while now to let it develop for "up to 5 years" as the bottle even states. I'll also be enjoying this one all night, even after it takes me an hour to drink myself (not because of poor drinkability but because I'm just enjoying it too much and want to savor it), but also because it'll be attached to my tongue all night. 4,783 charactersjlindros, Sep 19, 2010
4.51/5  rDev -1.5%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Pulling one of the bottles out of the cellar to review following my birthday on Monday!
Appearance: Using my trusty Spiegelau tulip, this brew pours a jet black with about a half finger of mocha colored head that dissipates quickly leaving a light ring around the edge of the glass. The lacing down the sides of the glass is magnificent, and when you consider the way this beer appeared to seep slowly out of the bottle and the total opaqueness in the glass; well, it just adds to the illusion of this beer.
Smell: This beer still smells wonderful, even 5 months after its release. Definitely picking up the bourbon that is typical of the BCS franchise, rich with notes of mahogany, chocolate, and vanilla. Where the original BCS would have left off though, this hearty concoction continues with a huge note of that Intelligentsia coffee and some other maltish scents. These combine to create one of the most enticing noses on any -bal aged stout I've had in some time.
Taste: This is a very complex flavor created by this beer. The first taste yields hints of roasted malts, chocolate, vanilla, and a tiny bit of caramel. As the beer further reaches the palate, more of the bourbon flavors from the barrels make their presence known along with some of the bitterness of the espresso beans. The tail end is high in alcohol, and definitely conveys this is a sipper through and through.
Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel is quite an adventure as well. Initially, this beer is a little bit crisper on the front of the tongue, but as the beer warms, the liquid becomes more of an ooze, coating the palate with the rich flavors imparted by the coffee and bourbon additions. The alcohol burn at the end is noticeable, but it is also kind of soothing. This isn't your typical stout, and the mouthfeel reminds you of this at every turn.
Drinkability: This beer is still drinking remarkably hot, and I'd tend to believe the label that it could develop well over the next 5 years. The coffee has faded somewhat, as others have noted, but it's still very prevalent, and it still helps make this beer of the most solid offerings from GI. All in all, I love the way this beer rolls off my tongue, and I'm excited I have several more bottles aging in the cellar.

Poured motor oil black with a little bit of head.
the aroma is just amazing! so much coffee and bourbon floating around each other with a bit of vanilla in the very back.
the taste is just fantastic. just like the nose leads to. Tons of coffee in the front followed by dark roasted semi bitter malts. finishes with a just strong enough bourban kick and leaves you with a nice vanilla finish in the mouth!

A- This beer looks really thick. It barely lets any bubbles through. Only a thin dark red cap forms. It fades quickly. No lacing.
S- JEEEEZUUSSS! Let this one warm up a few degrees (my fridge is set way too low) and you are greeted with an orgasmic blend of smooth, refined bourbon, silky vanilla, rustic oak, decadent chocolate, energetic espresso beans, lively berries like currants and classic licorice. 
T- Seriously one of the best beers Ive ever tasted. This is right down my alley. Big tastes of hype and rarity. Dark chocolate is HUGE. This beer is creamy as hell with a sweet milkiness, silky smooth vanilla and potent espresso. Bourbon comes around on the end and provides a strong alcohol kick.
M- One of the thickest beers out there. That paired with the low carbonation makes for a truly insane creaminess. Any boozy warmth comes so easily because of the silkiness of this beer's body.
D- 13% never went down so fast. I split this bomber and found that Im going to need about a case of this stuff.
This beer in one word: Consummate. 1,180 charactersMbpBugeye, Sep 16, 2010
4.55/5  rDev -0.7%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4A lot of Beer Advocates compare this brew to the likes of KBS. I'm here to express my opinion on the two, both of which I have just recently sampled.
A: Poured into my pint glass this Stout pours a wonderful twilight black. The head is about an inch thick and is quick dissipate. With the high ABV of this amazing brew, I'm not gonna knock points based on the head. It's important to note, that appearance wise I have seen better (darker), but it's just so close to perfect I have to give it a 5.
S: Unlike KBS BCBCS is more of a coffee laced with bourbon than a bourbon laced with coffee dominate nose. Fresh, this brew has much more chocolate notes compared to KBS. This stout is mouth watering. Along with KBS, I rate this nose a 5. KBS has more Bourbon, BCBCS has more espresso and chocolate. Whichever you prefer will float your boat. Personally I just love both.
T: The flavor is dominate chocolate with espresso. The bourbon is present in a big way, but not dominate. Chocolate really tends to linger here, this really is a perfect desert beer.
MF: Viscous, very very viscous, superior compared to KBS, who's MF is a little watered down (drinks more like bourbon at times). Carbonation is a little light, but this brew is very smooth. I'm almost tempted to rate BCBCS a 5.0.
D: Drinkability is excellent considering the ABV, although it's hard to make it trough a whole bomber.
Overall, this brew is almost the perfect stout. I may have rated it the same as KBS, but I still hold KBS as my personal favorite. Thanks Augustiner719 1,542 charactersTKEbeerman, Sep 16, 2010

4.62/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 22oz bottle into my Bruery tulip. It poured pitch black with a thin mocha head to it concentrated around the edges of the glass. 
The aroma has a fantastic mix of flavors. Bourbon, oak, vanilla all really come through much like the regular Bourbon County. A sweet, chocolaty toffee flavor helps balance out the roasty coffee flavors. The coffee is a bit milder then I anticipated. 
The taste really shows off the bourbon and barrel characteristics nicely without dominating the flavors. Dark chocolate comes through followed by a roasted coffee bitterness in the finish. It has so many flavors working for it and they all work together so well. 
The mouthfeel is thick and silky smooth. Carbonation is moderate to low. Drinkability is very good, it has such a great mix of flavors to it. As good as the regular Bourbon County is this one is better. The bitter coffee really helps balance out all the sweetness in it. Fantastic beer overall and one of, if not the best barrel aged stouts I've had. 1,013 charactersbillab914, Sep 11, 2010

Bottled 03/26/10 - my sister's birthday! Cheers to sisters.
Left out to warm from the fridge and served into my Watou glass.
Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout, or BCBCS, pours an espresso black color. It's all but black with a crema-like head.
Aroma is very powerful, just like the straight bourbon version. I can smell the coffee but what I wasn't prepared for was the oaky bourbon notes. Maybe I should have read the label more carefully - "Stout aged in bourbon barrels with coffee added." So Bob's your uncle.
Flavor is wonderfully complex and layered in its delivery. Sweet with vanilla up front, I then get the dark roasty malts that deliver a punch of coffee and chocolate. As I let it sit in my mouth, the bourbon comes on with force. The alcohol is as strong as the 13% would suggest. Oak in the form of vanilla, dark chocolate, molasses, and caramel.
Mouthfeel is full bodied, no question, and low in carbonation. The burn is evident in the mouth and on the way down. My gut is nicely warmed after just a few sips.
Overall, it still maintains its bourbon qualities. So much, in fact, that it doesn't seem all that different from the standard (non-caffinated) version. I was really hoping that the BCBCS would showcase the coffee in a more pronounced way. In that sense, it's a little disappointing but overall still a fantastic beer. 1,413 charactersGilGarp, Sep 11, 2010

Bottled on 3/26/10
A: Completely black with a tan head and plenty of carbonation. Heavy lacing left behind with each sip.
S: Boozy bourbon and sweet malt with a touch of oak. No coffee here.
T: The gentleman I was drinking this with called it a "velvet coated sledgehammer". I would agree. Very sweet malt and bourbon boozy on the front end with an alcohol burn in your esophagus and bitterness attacking the sides of your tongue on the back end. I don't get straight-out coffee from this one, but I am sure it must have added something to the complexity.
M: Creamy with good carbonation, but the heat from the 13% ABV attacks.
D: One hit from the sledgehammer was enough for me. 715 charactersSpica66, Sep 10, 2010

Pours an opaque dark brownish black, a touch of red in the corners, medium sized tan head forms and settles down to a medium ring, some lace spots stick, a bit of legginess, not too bad looking.
Smell is nice, huge coffee roast, chocolate wafers, toffee, bourbon, oak, vanilla, a touch fruity, some raisin, more roast, biscuit, more espresso, more vanilla, pretty intense aroma on this one.
Taste is nice too, big toffee and brown sugar sweetness up front, huge roast character, espresso and chocolate wafers, bourbon sweetness, vanilla beans, oak, more toffee, some alcohol, big roasty bitterness but balanced.
Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, pretty chewy, with low carbonation, warmth going down. Pretty nice stuff, coffee lends a neat character to an already fantastic beer, but I may prefer the original more. Thanks Scotty! 893 charactersViggo, Sep 09, 2010

Looks like a big stout
Reports of the coffee's demise are premature. Having had the regular BCS the night before, the coffee here really helps to smooth this beer out. Admittedly, I've liked but never really loved BCS. But here, the coffee helps to cut some of the bourbon heat while smoothing out the body and adding an extra layer of creaminess. Additionally, some waves of mocha and dark melted baker's chocolate make an appearance. 
Mouthfeel is somewhat velvety with low carbonation.
A bomber by oneself can become somewhat of a chore, despite the wonderful interplay of flavors. After time, the sweetness of the coffee pushes to the forefront, making a big time sipper. 835 charactersBarrytheBear, Sep 07, 2010

This beer pours the classic huge stout all black, with a bit of deep amber showing around the edges. An aggressive pour yields almost no head, but the little ring of dark tan that is there leaves decent lace. 
The aroma hits you smack in the nose with plenty of bourbon. Sweet roasty dark malts, vanilla laden oak and rich coffee are also present, but in the nose the bourbon rules the roost.
The flavor is a bit more balanced. Coffee and roasty dark malts mix with bourbon, vanilla and dark chocolate. The coffee tastes wonderfully rich, and the bourbon is nice and complex, with a pleasantly astringent factor added by all the dark malts. I am quite impressed at how well the vanilla notes show through from the oak.
The mouthfeel is full and somewhat chewy. It has a sticky and astringing finish that is not too bad for style, but not the best.
This is a sipper for sure, and hard not to compare to KBS. Overall KBS is definitely a superior brew, but this is a pretty tasty bourbon aged coffee stout that I would never turn down the chance to drink. 1,132 characterszoso1967, Sep 05, 2010

A: Pours an extremely dark brown, almost black, capped by a finger and a half of foamy, mocha-colored head. The head settles down to about a half finger and holds steady there.
S: Blend of rich coffee and vanilla and bourbon up front. Strong caramel takes up a backing role along with some moderately sweet chocolate and light oak character.
T: Caramel and some light roasted malts up front, which give way to chocolate and a big coffee presence on the mid-palate. Bourbon comes in shortly after at a well-restrained level, providing extra complexity but not overtaking the other flavors. Long finish of vanilla, bourbon and coffee.
M: Just shy of full bodied with low carbonation, very smooth but a touch too thin.
D: The ABV is well hidden and the finish is long, pleasant and invites another sip. Awesome beer. 871 charactersXul, Aug 31, 2010

 A- The jet black body supports a thick creamy tan fizzy head that soon fades to a thick ring and trails down the glass with each sip. 
S- The black espresso bean aroma is blended with a big bourbon aroma with some oaky hints. It seems to grow and grow with each sip.
 T- The very rich chocolate malt blends with a dry rich toffee flavor and some caramel sweetness and charcoal come through aswell. There is a cream and bourbon flavor that grows and has some dark prune flavors with it. The finish is a blend of black malt bitter roasted grain and coffee with a bourbon boozy quality mixed in.
 M- The medium-full mouthfeel has a gentle fizz that make the texture slightly slippery with a nice alcohol warming that grows as the beer warms.
 D- This beer has great depth with big bourbon on top of a big stout that is all mellowed and unified by the espresso. The more I sip the more layers of flavor come through. 986 charactersrhoadsrage, Aug 31, 2010
4.22/5  rDev -7.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Opaque black body with garnet hues visible around the slimmest edges when held to the light. Short one fine burnt sugar head recedes quicky leaving a slim ring. Lacing is minimal but not really expected. 
Sweet caramel, vanilla a bourbon hit the nose up front. A deep roasted malt is evident but subdued in comparison to the sweeter aromas. The coffee aroma fails to live up to expectation. While the coffee is there it is extremely subtle. 
I enjoyed this somewhat colder to start and the flavor evolved as it warmed. On the colder side a slight roastiness was overwhelmed by the much sweeter vanilla and caramel flavors. The bourbon was evident through out but not overwhelming. The coffee remains to be subtle and somewhat of an afterthought. As the beer warms a deep yet sweet cocoa flavor emerges with a light touch of molasses. The sweetness minimizes as the bourbons smooths out a bit. The coffee flavor is still subtle and nowhere close to slightly dominate as expected. While certainly a tasty beer, it is not what I expected.
Body is a bit thinner than the original BCS. BCBCS is still full bodied none the less. Carbonation is low but appropriate. Thick flavor leaves a long finish.
While a bomber is certainly more than enough, this is one I would go back to if not for the price. It was easy to enjoy and the booze was held in check. Very good beer and worth a look. 1,383 characterskzoobrew, Aug 29, 2010

S: Light espresso, vanilla, cocoa, bourbon, maybe some dark fruits hiding somewhere.
T: Big coffee flavor. Damn, this is a fantastic flavor profile. Full of vanilla and bourbon, tossed with dark chocolate. It reminds me of eating a bourbon soaked chocolate cake mixed with some tiramisu.
M: Full bodied, perfect carbonation (low), very warming. Very chewy!
D: This is the only place I could find any problems. It has so much alcohol, I think it slightly affects the drinkability. It really doesn't hurt it that much, but you can really tell there is some heat. I can still drink a whole bottle by myself. 
I have to say, this is probably my new favorite imperial stout. I will now be seeking out more bottles, as I would like to see how it ages over the next year or two. I know some people were claiming the coffee is dying off fast. I find this to be a very false statement. The coffee level right now is perfect and still quite strong. I feel that this should still improve over the next couple years. Once some of the heat dies down, this beer will be perfect. I feel like this is the only hyped up imperial stout that truly deserves all the attention it gets. 1,245 charactersraverjames, Aug 29, 2010

Bottled on 3-26-10
Pours completely pitch black, with a thin tan head that quickly fades. Lacing is one brown ring around the edge, that slides down the sides.
Smell is all intense malt, notes of molasses and anise all over the place, very sweet. The coffee is not as strong as I expected, with the bourbon adding a great accent. There's a nice aged quality, with a hit of alcohol at the very end. Strong, complex, and very good.
Taste is very sweet, almost sugary, followed by a big malty kick and light flavors of coffee and anise. Not nearly as complex as the smell leads you, and bordering on bland. The taste is redeemed by a great bourbon kick, adding the missing complexity. The finish is thick with malt sweetness and booze, with an earthy aftertaste. Disappointing from a coffee standpoint, but still very good.
Mouthfeel is very thick and slick, it coats the entire palate with big, malty flavors. Carbonation is on the low side contributing to the thickness.
Drinkability is surprisingly good, considering the high abv and huge, sweet flavors.
Overall, a great beer that just misses being one of my favorites. 1,145 charactersBMoney575, Aug 28, 2010

A: Thick, creamy, and hellacious. The look alone demands repect. It has colors very dark black with some ever so mild deep brown hues. The head is the same, a slight glimmer of deep brown.
S: Amazing nose rich chocolate, vanilla, and some boozy bourbon. 
I can only hope it taste as good as it smells...
T: Low and behold, it does! It has a perfect balance of all the things I smelled: vanilla, coffee, and chocolate...the boozy'ness is married well the other tastes.
M/D: The microbrewers fest in Indy was so unbearably hot, however, I could drink this all day, everyday. The fact I was sweating and sticky seemed to fade away after each sweet sip. The texture was amazing, rich and creamy but not over done. Bravo...

A- An absolutely pitch inky black liquid that leaves a thick residue on the sides on the glass if swirled. The dark brown head is quick to rise and fall. If this had some head retention this would be perfect.
S- Fresh brewed cold coffee, bourbon, black cherries, chocolate cake, and a hint of alcohol. Very smooth and restrained. 
T- Sweet dark chocolate, bourbon, coffee, black cherries, a bit of nuttiness, and just a hint of alcohol. I am amazed at how this beer unfolds on the palate. The bourbon is tame enough to allow some of the other flavors to make their presence known.
M- Oily smooth with just the slightest carbonation bite. The carbonation is active enough to keep the strong flavors from building on the palate too much. 
D- Jesus Christ on a cracker. Absolutely stunning. It may be rich, but the alcohol is mildly noticeable and the carbonation keeps it right light enough on the palate. I am curious but skeptical as to what more time would do to this beer. My mind is blown. KBS has a rival. 1,107 charactersgordavidson, Aug 27, 2010

Holy bourbon! Just smacks you in the nose at first but quickly the coffee and chocolate and roasty goodness take over. This beer smells heavenly. The coffee comes through loud and clear here so if this beer has faded at all than I wish I tried it fresher. 
Just insanely good. Lots of roasted coffee up front with some chocolate and hints of vanilla in there as well. The alcohol is present in the taste but I would not call it hot by any means. The flavors blend together so well and in such an intriguing way that I just want to savor and relish every mouth full. Finishes a bit on the bitter side from the coffee but still awesome. 
The mouth-feel is thick, creamy and pleasant. Perfect amount of carbonation. For such a high ABV the alcohol is not as present as I would have believed. I would say the only thing that takes away from the drink-ability here would be the high ABV. After one bomber it was clear I would be on the floor if I attempted another. 
Overall this beer is one of the best, if not the best Imperial Stout I have ever had. I would give it a slight edge over KBS, but just barely. 1,253 charactersPdiddey3d, Aug 27, 2010

D: Wow. I only had half the bottle (wine stopper, plan to finish tomorrow night) but I could have easily polished it off! If it wasn't so hard to come by, I would reach for this any time I was in the mood for a BA stout.

3.72/5  rDev -18.8%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4A - Black barrel-aged stout. More foam than regular BCBS, and seemingly a bit less viscous.
S - The nose is pretty nice; comprised of a good deal of Bourbon, vanilla, chocolate, roast and of course coffee. The coffee is not huge or overwhelming, but it is present in respectable amounts. The thing is, the coffee doesn't seem to add much complexity (compared to the base BCBS) but it does seem to interfere with the aromatic constituents' ability to fully meld into a cohesive dynamic. So, as far as the nose goes, the coffee is a minus.
T - See above, "Smell:" Seriously, in addition the negative contribution of the coffee in terms of being a 'meld-blocker', it has also diminished the viscosity and worst of all it has disrupted the delicate and dynamic balance that allowed the booze to be so prominent. The vanilla aspect of the flavor seems to be more prominent than the coffee, in both an overall sense, and comparatively. BCBCS is a good tasting beer, make no mistake about that, but it is a step in the wrong direction when compared to the regular BCBS; the coffee-infused incarnation is comparatively too hot, less flavorful, less balanced and is basically missing the magically dynamic interplay of beer and barrel that is found in the original.
M - Thinner and hotter than it should be. Still, pretty good.
D - This beer is still a very good tasting libation overall, it just falls short when viewed against the original. Perhaps it will age well, though I am not sure the pungency of the coffee will survive an extended cellaring. 1,547 charactersktrillionaire, Aug 24, 2010

A: Dark brown hue that sits motionless in the glass. There was a thin mocha head that rapidly turns into a ring
S: Basically smells like the regular version with some roasted coffee. Huge bourbon smell that is very inviting. Chocolate malt, vanilla, oak, nut, toffee and roasted coffee
T: Immediately after taking the first sip, I was worried I might have waited too long to drink this. Coffee flavor wasn't there. Clearly I jumped to conclusions as the finish was a beautiful creamy coffee flavor. So that's how it finished, what about how it started? Bourbon, vanilla and bitter chocolate all swirl together. Touch of alcohol, but really well hidden with all of the other flavors
M: Velvety smooth, super creamy with just a touch of tingly carbonation. Leaves a moderate roasted aftertaste
D: Goose Island took an already impressive beer and made it even better. Liked this a little more on tap - the coffee and bourbon came out a little more - but this is still a fantastic beer. Slow sipper and 22oz was ultimately a little too much in a sitting. I can only hope this is brewed again 1,279 charactersBrez07, Aug 24, 2010

A: The stout is a glorious black color, no dark browns that appear black or deep caramel red to be found here. Resting atop the monstrosity is an off-white, slightly tanned, head that 
sits as a thin band around the glass and a thin pool in the middle of it. No lacing here, too darn big.
S: This nose is just huge. Layer upon complex layer waft out. Sweet bourbon with vanilla and coconut is followed by bitter espresso with the burnt heft of an imperial stout lurking beneath it all. The bourbon is, by far, the dominant aspect of the nose, upsetting the apple cart balance-wise. Awesome nose nonetheless.
T: The relative lack of balance in the nose is quickly obliterated by a sip of this beer. Each flavor element is well-integrated, meshing seemlessly. In no particular order, stout flavors are murky and well-roasted. They add toast and charred flavors into the mix. Coffee is rich and full, roasted with an underlying sweet bitterness. Finally the bourbon, a hallmark of the Bourbon County series. It adds alcoholic heat along with sweet vanilla and coconut. A fantastic melding of flavors. The bourbon and stout are the strongest features, outdistancing the coffee. The finish is all bourbon, very hot, as though it just came out of the barrel.
M: The mouthfeel is, save for the boozy strength, a knock-out. The bourbon stands out, guiding the ale throughout the entire bottle. And what a great finish!
D: At 13%, I need a nap after finishing off the bomber. Despite the strength (and the punishment that would come in the morning), I'd gladly sip my way through another bomber if I had one. 1,719 charactersakorsak, Aug 23, 2010

poured from the bottle a deep dark chocolate brown / near black to a dogfish head signature glass with a very short lasting dark toffee brown head that leaves no lace and minimal retention. (second glass poured aggressively yielded a full finger head - though still zero retention)
sweet aroma of chocolate and dark espresso roast.
the first sips are so very sweet, the coffee perhaps has faded after four months (?), but it's still evident behind the dark chocolate. 
smooth, slick and sweet, low carbonation - if there's coffee bitters, i sure can't detect them. what a nice beer.

4.32/5  rDev -5.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured from a 22oz bottle into a snifter.
A - Pitch black, viscous, oily. A thin tan head lasts only briefly before fading.
S - Smells lovely. Mostly bourbon, but also some coffee and vanilla. Very roasty.
T - The first few sips taste strongly of bourbon. Following those my tongue acclimates and begins to taste a lot of vanilla, a bit of cocoa, and of course coffee. The taste is dominated by alcohol though, but with a 13% brew that is to be expected. In fact, without the high alcohol content to provide a strong bite, the beer would be too cloying. It's definitely not a beginner's beer, but it works well for the advanced pallet.
M - I'm finding the alcohol to be a bit much. I love the oily and syrupy nature of the beer, and the taste as the beer runs over the tongue is very complex. But the alcohol makes anything but sips nearly impossibly.
D - Again, this is not a beginner beer. Anyone who thinks they're going to sit down and drink a full bomber is probably mistaken. This is the type of beer where a bomber will be quite sufficient for 2 or 3 people to share after a nice meal.
Overall this is an excellent beer. But in my eyes, it is a beer to be searved as a nightcap, or as a dessert after a nice meal. This is a beer that demandds your attention. 1,271 charactersblackdog1101, Aug 22, 2010
4.5/5  rDev -1.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours black and very viscous. A small amount of coffee colored head tops it off briefly and quickly disappears. 
The nose is bourbon, coffee, chocolate nibs, deep roasted malts with some nice booziness. 
Lots of coffee and bourbon but the booziness isn't overpowering. 
Chocolate, molasses and lots of dark fruit. A touch of vanilla way in the back and malts that are roasted for days. 
Very full bodied and thick. Not quite syrupy but coats the mouth completely. Perfectly carbonated. 
An absolutely amazing beer. I wish I could buy 20
of these badboys. Highly recomend picking a few up if you can find it.

Pours ink black with a very thin tan head that seems to just float on top. Smells are booze, bourbon, coffee and sweet roasted malts. Tastes are caramel malts, coffee in the middle with a nice heavy boozy finish. I am so glad we split this, I'm not sure how long it would take me to drink an entire bomber of this. Very, very good. 385 charactersLukafer, Aug 18, 2010

A- Very dark near opaque pour. Vigorous pour into Ommegang tulip creates 1 finger tan head which quickly vacates. No real lacing. 
S- The bourbon is immediately noticeable giving into hints of vanilla and char. Rich dark chocolate and roasted coffee blend with the bourbon nicely. All the scents are a bit muted by alcohol. Only complaints about the nose would be that the bouquet is a bit too alcohol dominated.
T- Oh man. This is the good stuff. The worry of dominant alcohol suggested by the nose is of no concern here. Dark chocolate, rich creamy vanilla, charred oak, roasted grain- its all here. Coffee is in there for sure as well, but less than what I expected. Alcohol is present but not as strong as in the nose. It is warming and complementary, not solvent at all or as aggressive as you would expect it to be in a 13% beer. 
M- Low to medium carbonation that works well for the beer and style. Body is nice and thick without becoming syrupy. Nice and creamy, really coating the palate well.
D- High for the style, much higher than the standard BCBS. The well hidden alcohol makes this one easier to put down, but just the shear weight of it would limit my intake.
All in all a fantastic beer. I didn't think it could get better than KBS the first time I had one, but it did. This is hands down the best coffee stout I have had. 1,445 charactersahurd11085, Aug 18, 2010

A: Pours a dark black with a small brownish head that faded quickly. No lacing at all. Beers way to dark to see any carbonation, but I can hear some fizzing after the pour.
S: Strong bourbon right off the top. Some coffe sents, but not to strong. I have heard that the coffe flavors are fadding in this beer if aged, this maybe true. Also picking up the sents of alchol, probably from the bourbon.
T: At first roasted malts, then some chocalte. After that you can really tates the coffe. Alittle hot at the end from the bourbon, but a strong after tates of coffe!
M: I'd say this beer is on the heavier side of medium bodied. Very little carbonation with some pricklies on the tongue. Overall very smooth.
D: Very good stout IMO. This is a great sipper! If you are a fan of coffe and bourbon you should seel this beer out. 860 charactersRTrain12, Aug 18, 2010

a - pours just short of pitch black with a one-finger, tan head, retention around the collar and light lacing
s - espresso, dark chocolate, toasty oak and boozy heat are all present with lighter notes of black cherry, tar and brown sugar, a whole lot going on in the aroma
t - lots of dark, bittersweet chocolate and charred espresso up front and on the midpalate, nice dark fruit component on the midpalate as well with black cherry flavors as well as a light vanilla creaminess, the barrel aging really comes through on the finish with considerable toasty oak and bourbon heat notes coming through, a little boozy, but nothing offensive considering the 13% abv, as with the smell, this is really complex stuff, somewhere in between 4.5 and 5
m - full-bodied with slightly low carbonation, about what I'm looking for with the style, big alcohol warming
d - certainly a sipper, but pretty drinkable for a huge imperial stout, I find it much more drinkable than the original BCS, the taste and smell are both complex and interesting
I wasn't sure about this beer beforehand because I haven't enjoyed the last few vintages of the original BCS, but this is really good stuff -- one of the best imperial stouts I've had this year, right there with Beer Geek Brunch Weasel and just behind Parabola. 1,337 charactersWeisGuy, Aug 17, 2010

A - Pours out black, with a very nice one finger carmel colored head. The head hung around awhile and was not quick to disappear. This beer is not motor oil thick like some other stouts I have had.
S - Bourbon dominates the nose of this beer. Maybe I waited to long to drink, but not getting to much coffee. Which was a big let down for me. Also getting vanilla and maple syrup.
T - Not overwhelmingly bourbon as would suggest in the aroma. But very good nonetheless. Roasted malts, as the coffee is trying to peek thru. Vanilla and bourbon, but the heat is very mild for the high abv.
M - Good and would have given a higher score if the body were thicker and creamy. But the carbonation was done right.
D - Had no problem putting down this bottle. Not a lot of heat from a 13% beer. I only wish that I had it fresh, because I did not get alot of coffee out of this one. Reminded me of a slightly sweeter version of BCS. IMO. 972 characterskk73, Aug 15, 2010

pours deep dark brown, not quite black or opaque, with a thin very fine brown head. the head drops fast with a few spots of lace.
aroma is great. bourbon and vanilla. dark and milk chocolate. espresso and a bit of coffee. light alcohol. big biscuit and whole wheat bread. big vanilla, coming out more as it warms. the aroma seems much like the regular bourbon county stout, but a bit more coffee coming through in the finish.
taste is awesome. bourbon, vanilla, and COFFEE!!! everything i love from the standard bourbon county stout with a big coffee and espresso finish. vanilla. dark and milk chocolate. just when i'd expect a regular bourbon county to trail off the coffee jumps in. feels like the vanilla pops out more in this version too. lightly toasted whole wheat bread. bit of biscuit. as it warms it gets even more chocolaty too.
mouthfeel is great. nice big body. just under medium carbonation level.
drinkability is great. great balance. great barrel character. nice balance with the barrel and the alcohol. great integration of the coffee. a damn fine brew. now if only it wasn't so damn hard to find! 1,171 charactersgrub, Aug 13, 2010

Pours a dark brown, almost black, with a finger of creamy tan head which recedes to a collar.
Cappuccino and bourbon dominate the nose, a sweet, smooth combo that reminds you of your favorite warming, alcoholic coffee mix. Along with milk chocolate, a rich sweetness.
Quite a sweet brew which feels a little over the top at times - sweet milk chocolate, espresso, a real smooth coffee flavor, bourbon, a light to medium roast character, brown sugar and vanilla. Thick, residual sweet body which is decadent to the extreme, some alcohol heat in the finish. Enjoyable but wearying in large amounts.
Light carbonation, full mouthfeel - this is one of those ultimate dessert beers that you enjoy immensely in small quantities but if you try and drink too much it will only make you sick of it. Much like its little brother, it probably needs some time to mellow out a bit. 935 charactersritzkiss, Aug 13, 2010
4.67/5  rDev +2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Sent to me by a very generous timmi.
A- Inky black with a finger of mocha colored head. Head goes down to a thin ring and leaves bits of lacing throughout the session.
S- Notes of bourbon, coffee, chocolate and vanilla. One of the best aromas I've ever beheld in a beer. 
T- Tons of bourbon and coffee with hints of chocolate on the finish. The sweetness and booziness are well blended and makes for an excellent taste.
M- Super smooth, very creamy with a heavy body. This has to be one of the thickest beers I've ever had. Fantastic.
D- Despite the booziness and sweetness of it it's very drinkable. I kept grabbing that glass just to take a whiff of it and quaff some more down. A truly world class beer, extremely similar to KBS. I'll probably lay the other one down in the cellar and see what happens.
I truly appreciated this one timmi! 847 characterskbeals, Aug 13, 2010
4.35/5  rDev -5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Reviewed from my notes. Split with BlessedBeBeer. The BCBCS is a dark brown beer. It has a great brown foam head; very thick and pretty. There are a lot of scents in the aroma. I can detect sweet malt, dark chocolate and bourbon. It also has a very complex flavor. I can taste two kinds of chocolate, milk and dark. Ther eis also a lot of bourbon. The alcohol provides a very sharp finish. This is a full-bodied, creamy beer. It has medium/high levels of carbonation. There is a hot alcohol burn when you swallow, but it's pleasant. Personally, I like that trait in a good bourbon barrel aged stout. For what this is, it is pretty drinkable. Some age on a bottle would temper the heat from the alcohol and would probably improve this already great beer. Consuming the entire 22oz bottle would not be difficult, but I wouldn't want any more than that in a sitting. Still, this is a great one to share. Try it if you can. 919 charactersToasterChef, Aug 12, 2010

4.42/5  rDev -3.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4A big thanks to Andrew for bringing this by the Goat, just for kicks. 
Appearance- Black, frankly. A thin mocha ring caps it nicely. 
Smell- Chocolate covered espresso beans. Tons of bourbony vanilla. Some roasted marshmallow. Some raisin. 
Taste- Lots of chocolate, emphasized by the coffee. It's like coffee ice cream. There is a little roastiness on the finish. I'd really prefer more bourbon, I miss those vanilla notes. Still, quite nice. 
Mouthfeel- Great. Thick, coats the tongue. Velvet. This is just right. 
Drinkability- Good and smooth. No hint of the booze. 
Honestly, I wish it were just the 2008 BCS. I'm not personally a coffee drinker, and I had a bottle of the 2008 a few days before trying this and it was exquisite. The best part of that beer was the wonderful vanilla bourbon notes. Here the coffee covered that up somewhat, which is a shame. Still, this is excellent, whether you like coffee or not. 926 characterscallmescraps, Aug 10, 2010

A - Thick viscus looking beer. Black as night. Thick brown head, thin as compared to the vigor of the pour. Laces well. Head falls to a thin ring around the rim of the glass. 
S - Nice. Lots of dark chocolate. Strong vanilla and bourbon. The coffee comes out as a dark roast which blends into the chocolate. 
 Plenty of sweetness.
T - Amazing, its put together perfectly. The sweet vanilla starts out. Which falls into a roasted dark cohcolate and coffee. Better then any piece of candy I have ever taste. The dry oak flavors finish out with the astringent roasted barley. 
M - Silky smooth. Thick but not cloying. Warmer with out any alcohol flavors. 
O - Amazing beer. I love this, need to get more to age. Its hard to not inhale whats in front of me. 800 charactersDwnTwnBwn, Aug 10, 2010

Special thanks to TheSevenDuffs for this suprise.
A- Thick, oily, opaque black pour. This beer is as black as they come. Moonless night black. Was able to get a 1/2 finger dark khaki head that lasted mere seconds. Lacing isn'tgreat but that is to be expected.
S- Bourbon right off the bat, burnt coffee, slight alcohol tingles the nose. Brown sugar, tobacco, vanilla and slight toffee.
T- The coffee was still quite prominent on this which made me very happy. Bourbon lingering with every whiff. Sugar cane, faint tobacco, caramel and the alcohol is a little noticible.
M- This is one chewy heavy beer, my lips get stickier with every sip. It's like a coffee, alcohol flavored piece of candy.
Man this one is excellent. The bourbon was a little off putting at first but really grew on me about half way through! 871 characterskorguy123, Aug 10, 2010
3.96/5  rDev -13.5%look: 2.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Bottled March 2010 and poured into a snifter. Thanks to yourefragile for hooking this one up in a trade. 
Looks: glugs black as motor oil from the bottle with no head to speak of -- just the tiniest tan ring, which leaves the tiniest lines of trailed lacing. 
Smells: rich and buttery. Lots of warm bourbon and lightly bitter medium-roast coffee. Oak, vanilla, molasses, plums and dark chocolate all also make appearances. Espresso emerges as the beer warms a bit. 
Tastes: sweet. Sugary bourbon mixes with medium-roast coffee, which seems to be muted. Granted, this beer has some age on it, but the flavors of Black Cat espresso beans seem much subtler than I thought they would be. The coffee flavors do, however, work to balance the strength of the bourbon, which is usually a bit overbearing in BCS. Butter, raspberry dark chocolate bars and toffee round out the flavor profile. 
Feels: medium-bodied and smooth, with a light carbonation. Very nice, not overwhelming or intense. 
Drinks: like second-best. As bourbon-aged coffee stouts go, I'd still rank KBS above this guy, but this beer's still pretty damn solid, with a great blend of flavors. It's definitely Bourbon County Stout, but with an added interest and complexity. 1,236 charactersPhelps, Aug 10, 2010

4.67/5  rDev +2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Taken from notes written on 06-20-2010.
Appearance - Pours a relatively opaque (though not totally) dark brown color into a Bruery tulip. Sparse head that leaves little lacing, however, this is appropriate for such a monstrous beer.
Smell - Heavy roasted malts and vanilla followed by a medium, though not strong, coffee aroma. Hints of bourbon, dark chocolate, and molasses fill the air. You know this is going to be a mean tasting SOB.
Taste - This is the second time I have had this beer, and both times were very similar to the nose. The initial taste is the slight coffee that is immediately overtaken by the bourbon and roasted malts. Vanilla and molasses finish up at the tail end.
Mouthfeel - Medium to full bodied, lower carbonation, chewy mouthfeel.
Drinkability - I don't think I could ever drink a bomber of this by myself (nor could I of regular BCS). I will try this side by side this Christmas with a 2008 BCS (since the coffee version was aged longer it would be more similar to the 2008 than 2009 BCS imo) to see just how different they are. I thoroughly enjoyed this beer and at such a high ABV, it invites one to share it with good friends and family. I am glad I have eight more in my cellar to age over the years to come. A very good beer. 1,265 charactersSpdKilz, Aug 09, 2010
4.41/5  rDev -3.7%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 2.522oz bottle courtesy of jsilva (thanks John!), into a snifter. Not sure if we'll see another bottling of this, but if we do this one is the 2010 bottle. 
A -The first pour is at fridge temp, and it's not very impressive -- black as night, but just a thin cap of mocha-colored foam on top. Subsequent pours as it warms are much better, with increasingly large head each time. Agitation shows off its legs, with the head building back up easily once it gets closer to room temperature. Not much in the way of lacing, even with a clean, dry glass. 
S - Holy bourbon! I absolutely love the way bourbon-barrel-aged beers smell, and this is pretty much a perfect example. Lots of the typical bourbon notes without lighting my nose up by being too boozy. Tons of caramelized sugar, toffee, vanilla, and a healthy dose of espresso towards the back. Oatmeal cookie and dark fruit like raisins and figs come forward as it warms. Awesome smelling beer. 
T - Wow, they've really integrated the bourbon well. It's not too forward, and just melds in with the other flavors. Think of an oatmeal-raisin-bourbon cookie, and you're halfway there. More vanilla than in the nose. Starts off bitter, then sweet in the middle with the bourbon, and finishes like it started, with that bitter espresso. The coffee is certainly there, but not front-and-center like I would've expected. Perhaps it's faded a bit as some have mentioned, but for me it's exactly where it needs to be. I'd like to have this for breakfast every morning.
M - Thick, viscous, and chewy. I used to wonder what that meant, but this is a great example -- it's almost like taking a bite of food and chewing it. This beer (and its siblings, obviously) are perfect instances of beer-as-meal.
D - Honestly, I just don't understand all the 4+ drinkability ratings for this one. Really? You're going to have multiple bottles of this? Without a nap? I have doubts. I *love* the flavors, and could have that all day, but in the end any 13% abv beer is going to take its toll. I'll be lucky to finish the bomber without a break. So minus points for getting me hammered, but plus points for the fact that I *want* more. 
O - Like I said before, I'd like to have this in the morning in place of my coffee everyday, if I could somehow. This is an incredible beer, maybe in the top three that I've ever had. 2,348 charactersdjmichaelk, Aug 08, 2010

Poured into a snifter glass.
A - Dark black finger width of mocha head that dissipates quickly. Minimal lacing is left on the glass. I'd like a bit more head retention on this, but it's nice looking none the less.
S - Rich chocolate and coffee with a touch of bourbon. There's a noticeably boozy smell as the beer opens up...must be the bourbon
T - Coffee and bourbon with chocolate. They mix great, and it's just a rich melding of these tastes the entire time. It's quite overwhelming, and quite delicious.
M - Heavy body with low carbonation. Doesn't get much better than this for a big stout. Might have liked a touch more chewy mouthfeel.
D - Heavy stout, but very very good. Compliment with your breakfast, main course, dessert...doesn't matter. It could be consumed all the time.
On a side note, this makes a great beer for a beer float. I had it with the chocolate rain ice cream @ The Bruery a couple weekends back. 973 charactersKaiser81, Aug 07, 2010

The smell after 6 months has faded in the coffee dept, and more bourbon is coming through, but this one is still a sweeter smelling beer then BCS, you can tell that easily.
The coffee is still there on the tongue, along with that melded bourbon flavor that is warm but not hot, Bella. There is definently some bitterness going on, weither it's from the coffee or other roasted malts or maybe some of both. There is a fruity flavor so dark in here, the closest thing i can think of is pomegranite or currants, but just dark and covered in chocolate.
Mouthfeel has quite a bit of carbination, more then i expected, which goes well with the viscosity which is massive. 898 charactersChadQuest, Aug 04, 2010
4.25/5  rDev -7.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4This bottle just came out of nowhere. Split with Oglmcdgl and Darin.
Black in the glass, BCBCS is black. A small amount of dark tan that does not make a cap quickly fades to nothing. Looks very similiar to the regular as in it's pretty still beer. Not even swirls could bring anything back, no lace.
Smells pretty spectacular, a large amount of roasted malt and coffee with the bourbon taking the backseat but not hiding. This smells less boozy than the original, it's quite hidden. Chocolate nibs and no vanilla in sight. 
Im blown away by the mix of chocolate, coffee and bourbon with out all the heat or alcohol. I gotta say the alcohol is pretty much gone, it's there but so so small. The bourbon tastes are sharp and the coffee is roasty and dark, these two are practically neck and neck, but I think the bourbon is hidden by the mix of chocolate and coffee. Small amounts of wood, big amount of taste.
Mouthfeel is thick and coating and somewhat sryupy but not really. Quite viscous but smooth as hell thanks to small amounts of heat. Carbonation is on the low side and im quite alright with that. Able to be swished around the mouth without getting overburdened with burnt coffee, a nice roast.
No way I could I polish off a bomber of this and why would I people need to try this beer, it's really good but not my favorite coffee stout. It's a sipper for sure, BCBCS demands respect. 1,395 charactersBARFLYB, Aug 03, 2010

A- pour almost pitch black and thick as hell hints of dark brown at the edges. Very viscous stuff as only a small coffee colored cap rises from the brew. 
S- oh snap! This has a hell of a nose. Baclava like layers of chocolate, coffee, molasses, dates, plums. Dark roasted malts and sweetness out the ass. Hint of chared wood and the bourbon in the back. 
T- well I'm struck down by this one. Bitter sweet chocolate and brownie batter. Loads of coffee and cream with blackstrap molasses and brown sugar. Vanilla, bourbon, smokey wood. Cocoa powder covered dark berries. 
M- full bodied, chewy and thick but the carb is at that perfect level let's the brew sit on the palate but never feel dead. I just want more.

Dark brown/nearly black opaque body, no visible carbonation due to hue. Minimal tan head, medium dissipation with minimal lacing. The nose is very, very boozy, coffee buried by the alcohol, does get a bit sweeter as the beer warmed. Taste is too boozy, alcohol subsumes the coffee, bourbon barrel notes come through, a bit sweet, not picking up too much hops. Mouthfeel is pretty hot, a bit astringent and filling. If you can cut through the booziness this taste pretty good, but too young and hot, needs another six months to smooth out the alcohol heat, I'm sure this will be better down the road, but it was too boozy right now. Needs some time, check bottling date before consuming. 784 charactersjdense, Aug 01, 2010

Taste: Bourbon up front, while not too over powering, you know it's there and the focus on it. Roasted malt, chocolate, vanilla with a nice hint of the of coffee in the aftertaste. As it warms up more of the complexity shines through. 
Mouthfeel: Full bodied and ridiculously smooth. Coats your mouth with its goodness. 
Drinkability: I will be seeking out more of this, as the couple of bottles I have left, might not last too much longer. An absolute joy to drink this amazing beer. Can't wait for the Vanilla version. 761 charactersAxic10, Jul 31, 2010

A- Pours a very deep brown with little light showing through. A decent mocha head that doesn't leave much for lacing.
S- Nice smooth coffee, big roasted malts and some nice smooth bourbon. The oak makes itself present later on and the alcohol comes out just a bit.
T- Very nice coffee and bourbon. Oak and nice roasted malts. The booze is barely even present. Pretty well balanced, more so that the regular.
M- Full bodied but incredibly smooth. Just a little carbonation that tickles the side of the tongue. Just a little bit of heat on the back of the throat.
D- A sipper for sure. The coffee adds a nice layer. I would have to say I will prefer the original. I am wondering what some age will do to the coffee flavor. 790 charactersWisconsinality, Jul 30, 2010

A-Pours black with a vigorous pour producing a thin mocha colored head that faded very quickly and left no lacing
S-Bourbon, bourbon and bourbon. There are also hints of coffee (given the name of this beer, the lack of coffee in the nose is disappointing), a whiff of chocolate and vanilla, also a bit of malt.
T-Bourbon leads followed up by a coffee flavor that is more pronounced than in the nose. Lingering in the middle and back are notes of coffee, vanilla, toffee and roasted malt.
M-Full bodied and rich. Very creamy and silky. Coats the palate well.
D-For such a humongous beer, this is very drinkable.
Glad I was able to finally get hold of this one but I would love to have one fresh and have another to age for a year. If you like the style, you probably will love this one. 836 charactersLerxst, Jul 28, 2010

4.54/5  rDev -0.9%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Chocolate and bourbon in brew form with a beautifully integrated coffee sense. 
Presentation: 22 oz brown capped bottle. Simple red label design with white and gold font trying to have a sober and exclusive look (In essence a variation in red from the regular BCS) . Side narrative notes general brew intent, origin of the coffee, and inspiration to use the beans from their brewery neighbor "Intelligentsia" . Shows bottling date, (03/26/10 1639) and dedicated glassware. Notes Alc. by Vol. (13.0%) Served in a snifter.
A - Black body, small dark brown-ruby edges with a small brown frothy head. Average to small retention with almost non-existent lacing.
S - Boozy bourbon notes, chocolate, coffee, and a boozy malt whiff. Sweet roastness with nicely integrated complexity.
T - Same outstanding stout roasted bourbon profile with the chocolate still rich but paired by a very assertive but nicely integrated coffee current. Light touches of vanilla, and licorice also punctuate the background.
M - Full body, creamy and thick, lingering texture with little but adequate carbonation.
D - Nice slow sipper, with a growing and assertive flavor worth every sip.
Notes: Nice variation on the BCS flagship... But while it is rather nicely done, drinkability feels a touch shorter next to the original version. I´ve enjoyed this version tremendously, and I really liked the coffee edge, but felt a bit too long towards the end. Really recommendable in any case. 1,464 charactersDaniellobo, Jul 27, 2010

T- Heavinly combo of coffee and bourbon. Much smoother than I expected. Sweet caramel flavors overpower the inherent alcohol taste.

4.27/5  rDev -6.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Thanks go out to yourefragile for sending me this. Poured into a snifter.
I get a half a finger dark beige head that fairly quickly sizzles away to a ring of foam clinging to the edge of the glass. Oily legs pull any lace back into the glass. The body is incredibly black with hints of bourbon like color at the extremities when held to light.
The nose is big and bold with caramel, toffee, molasses, some raisins, bourbon, charred oak, vanilla, and a hint of smokey coffee.
The flavor starts off with sweet molasses, brown sugar, toffee, caramel, dark chocolate then roasty espresso, peat, smoke, and ending on a alcoholic bourbon note. Smoke and peat hang around between sips.
The mouthfeel is full bodied, rich, and thick. Low carbonation, but there is something about the texture of the carbonation that I don't like that kind of reminds me of the fizzy/sizzling sound the head made as it died down (I guess the best way to describe it would be fizzy?).
The alcohol is fairly well masked, but still makes sure you don't forget about it. Good drinkability overall. Not a huge improvement over Bourbon County Brand Stout, but the coffee adds some bitterness and balance to the mix. 1,188 charactersbillshmeinke, Jul 24, 2010
4.97/5  rDev +8.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5From the bottle to my dt tulip, this pours a miniscule head that sticks around in a ring throughout the experience. My dad and I actually tried to see if we could get a light through this, yeah right... Whisps of head dissapate quickly as I sip this sipper.
This beer smells like bourbon county stout and KBS made love. Malty sweetness, slight alcohol hotness, big bourbon, less-big coffee, this beer is HUGE.
Coffee comes through in the taste and it is amazing. I can't imagine how this would have tasted fresh, hopefully next year I can try it within a month or two of its release. Coffee and chocolate bitterness aftertaste is not unpleasant at all, very reminiscent of how actual coffee or actual chocolate would taste (bitter, but in the best way). Taste is similar to aroma: malty, very clean (not so roasty) alcohol, bourbon, plus that amazing coffee/chocolate aftertaste.
Mouthfeel is the definition of velvety. WOW
Drinkability is high for a stout of this size.
I will say that one thing my dad and I agreed on is that there really isn't anything wrong with this beer. Try as we might, we just could not fault it for anything, except maybe lack of lacing. We both thought it wasn't like, shed-a-tear good; but fresh, I could well imagine this beer would have been like, top 3 or 5 ever. ISO:2011 bcbcs 1,315 charactersaesopsgato, Jul 24, 2010
4.57/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4*Started drinking a regular 2008 BCS halfway through this review as a baseline.
 Looks rich. Darker than dark brown with a muddy head, big bubbles. No retention, no surprise. Settles to a still black pond in my glass. 
 Smells like Kahlua aged bourbon! I mean, Bourbon aged Kahlua! Um... wait, what? Whatever, it's Awesome! Also very old wood, chocolate and vanilla, espresso; but really, it just smells like sweet, sweet, coffee booze.
 I think it's best to start by comparing the taste to the original BCS: Sweeter, less wood, more coffee (A DUH!), more tobacco, slightly more bitter. More heat, though still very reasonable for 13%. I don't know if it is alcohol burn or acidity from the coffee, but the slight harshness is the only reason I didn't give it a 5. The coffee is very prominent on the finish; it's like I swallow beer and there's gourmet coffee left in my mouth. I like coffee, but I don't love it, and this translates well. I know they're different, but KBS, Wake n Bake, etc. just can't match the smooth balance exhibited here.
Feel is luscious, creamy, chewy, and a little "pinchy", just like the original. 
Drinkability? If I had 2 more bombers, I'd kill them with my girlfriend over the next 4 hours. Then I'd pass out happy.
 I think I like the original better, but that isn't saying much since 2 yr old BCS is my favorite stout, maybe my favorite beer ever besides Brute.
Suggested pairing: Fresh baked (I mean like 15 minutes fresh) chocolate chip cookies. Oh yeah. 1,493 characters7ways, Jul 23, 2010

Vanilla, creamy marshmellow velvet smooth mouthfeel. Dry bitter cocoa finish. Touch of peppery bourbon at the end. And oddly enough, a dollop of whip cream on the roof of the mouth.

The aroma is pretty much right where I expected. Roast black coffee, bourbon and light chocolate. Hint of campfire. 
The flavor is basically a mirror of the nose. Smooth rich coffee and bourbon. Light touches of chocolate and fire roasted malt. No surprises here.
Fully thick body. Chewy and mouth coating. No carbonation.

A: This beer pours a somewhat thick, opaque black with a 1/2 inch of coffee colored head. Head recedes quickly leaving minimal to no lacing on the glass.
S: Nose is of bourbon,touch of vanilla, molasses, and dark chocolate. I'm not picking up much in the way of coffee on this one. 
T: Taste starts with some dark fruit notes, raisins is what is most present. Dark bitter chocolate then comes through to fill out the middle. Finish is hint of oak, vanilla and bourbon... lots and lots of bourbon. Coffee is a minor undertone flavoring through out.
M: Full body, low carbonation, rich and creamy body.

Edit: I've had this one about 6-7 times now, fresh and aged, and I think when fresh BCS Coffee is the best of the variations. Aged it fades to the same as the normal BCS, but if you can get this fresh it is the best of the BCS beers. 981 charactersmdfb79, Jul 17, 2010

Smell: An alluring aroma, smooth and full of notes of roasty espresso beans, mellow bourbon, brown sugar, toasted marshmallows, a wizard's spiral oak staff, and dark chocolate truffles.
Taste: A ripple of sweet sugariness in the fore followed fast with a taste of top-notch coffee dosed with chocolate sauce, dark brown sugar, and a generous dusting of vanilla sugar. Clean, well-integrated bourbon accents. Dark fruitiness tucked away in the background. Notable oaken tones. Hint of roasty bitterness. A curtain call of all the various flavors preclude the positively warming, sweetish finish.
Mouthfeel: Medium-full body. Medium-low carbonation. Smooth, velvety texture.
Drinkability: Damn, that's delicious. Quite strong but quite good. I recall the label mentioning something about aging it up to five years, but I dare say it's fantastic and ready now, unless you want to engage in an exercise in sheer willpower. 1,011 charactersChainGangGuy, Jul 16, 2010

tons of sweetness mixed with coffee, chocolate, and alcohol. these all blend together to bring out a desert type scent or sweet dark candied fruits. hints of chocolate.
sweet up front with an emerging coffee and chocolate combination. the heat from the booze really starts to come out and just sit you down. light roasted malts are actually hidden in the back. this is a coffee and booze bomb.
one of the thickest stouts i've ever had. very chewy with syrup and motor oil like properties. 
pretty amazing over all however the ABV is what brings this down. way too much booze in this and it REALLY heats up. it would be a great candidate to age but then the coffee would potentially fade. bummer. 784 charactershooliganlife, Jul 15, 2010
4.6/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Decided to crack this one after hearing the coffee flavor is fading fast, I think a couple months of aging will be good for this brew. IIRC it has already been pre-aged for quite a while then the coffee added.
Pours a thick, dark black and try as it might, the light can't shine through this beastly opaque liquid with only a hint of ruby/brown at the very top edge. The head is huge and dark tan, though it dissipated quickly with no lacing, no biggie with this type of alcohol content.
The coffee is still there in the smell and it blends wonderfully with the Bourbon County Stout. This one is also significantly oakier than the regular it seems. The nose is a cornucopia of dark malt scents including, chocolate, roasted malts, caramel, and a hint of fruitiness. The coffee is in there with a nice fresh coffee smell that isn't the same as the roasty malt scents. On top of it all is the aforementioned oak, very nice woodiness and vanilla smooth out the smell. And of course you can't forget the bourbon and the alcohol, both add a sweet alcoholic bite just to prick your nostrils.
The taste is pretty damn good, I'm not a fan of BCS, and I've only had it fresh so having it mellowed out and with coffee added, it is a whole other beast. It is still on the cloying side with a big alcoholic punch, but it is infinitely smoother with the coffee addition and extra aging. The bourbon is still key here but when it melds with the coffee it smooths out and becomes delightful. Of course the chocolate, roasty malts, caramel, and dark fruit all make an appearance here as well as the oak.
The mouthfeel is rich and thick liek BCS with a subtle carbonation. The alcohol is once again a bit burning but dramatically reduced form BCS. The drinkability issue and cloying mouthfeel were somewhat fixed but not completely, nevertheless, the hardly get in the way of the decadent flavor.
I did not want to believe the hype, but this is so much better than BCS and one of my favorites now. 1,985 characterscrossovert, Jul 14, 2010

S: Loads of vanilla and oak, with some coffee and sweet roasted malt. 
T: A good dose of coffee on the front end followed by dark roasted malts and sweet dark fruits. Vanilla. Oak. Bourbon. Brightens up on the end with the heat and lightness of the high alcohol content. 
M: Heavy with a lower carbonation. Somewhat viscous. A bit of fusel spice.
D: A good beer. Would have liked to seen this one be a bit more aggressive on the coffee flavor and the sweetness toned done. However, there is an interesting complex of flavors going on, resulting in a quality drink that I have slightly mixed feelings about. 808 charactersFlorida9, Jul 14, 2010

4.57/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4The beer pours a blackish brown color with good head retention and lacing. The beer looks attractive, but is hardly anything mind blowing. However, then I took my first sniff.
The aroma is hugely attractive, consisting of a very fine, very strong aroma of coffee (naturally), vanilla, caramel, milk chocolate and milk duds. Flavors replicate the nose, but the famous GI bourbon really comes on strong on the palate, adding another attractive dimension. It helps to keep the sweetness in check, and gives some additional backbone to the flavor profile. There's also a hint of licorise, which plays well with the rest of the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is very rich and long, though I think it would be even more attractive if the carbonation was dialed down a bit. That would lend a creaminess to this beer that it doesn't have at present. Neverthless, I'm impressed by the richness and long finish in this very fine beer. As for drinkability, the abv. is 13% and you can tell this isn't exactly a session beer. Still, considering the alcohol and sweetness, this is a pretty easy to appreciate and enjoy beer. 
Not sure how much better this is than the regular GIBCS, but there's no denying that it's pretty damn good. I think I like this version, as the coffee tends to tone down the booze just a bit, while retaining most of the excellent bourbon flavor one gets in the regular version. Regardless. This is a very fine RIS from GI. 1,432 charactersJohn_M, Jul 13, 2010
4.62/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.522 oz bomber into The Bruery tulip, with a humble thank you to the always-too-generous Jeff (Alewatcher). Rated at room-temp or just a bit below. I started the glass a bit cooler, and rated a bit lower, but this one is a must-serve at close to room-temp. Improved at least .5 points even from cellar temp.
Pours none more black, with a thinnish brown head that dissipates fairly quickly into a thin bubbly ring. The ring, however, lasts almost the length of the glass, which is nice. 
Nose is classic Bourbon County - massive wave of bourbon to start things off, boozey, oaky, and spicy, which slowly fades back after a few inhales to allow room for rich espresso, lush, fudgy chocolate and light vanilla. I get a bit of currant in the background. 
Taste follows suit; the alcohol in this one is not what I would call well hidden, but it certainly isn't overwhelming for a beer of this size. This is another BA beer that almost feels like Bourbon has actually been added to the beer; I say that not as a quality judgment, but as an observation. Regardless, the initial taste is big stout that's actually smoothed out and almost muted by the even bigger bourbon. Oak, the drying bite of the alcohol, and a noticeable dose of tannins brace up the bourbon, with muted - though muted isn't quite the right word, perhaps enveloped - notes of huge, fudgy chocolate, a bit of light roasted malt and a firm (and delicious) roasted espresso presence. Finish is long, boozy, with the rich, fudgy notes trailing off and leaving behind the dry oak, bourbon, loads of coffee, and a bit of a lingering dark fruit character accented by the bourbon and, like the nose, reminiscent of currants. Exhales evoke the fantastic coffee character long after your last sip, and almost more clearly then the flavor profile. 
Mouthfeel is good; the big alcohol and strong tannins from the oak cut the weight of the beer and dry it out a bit, but even so there's no way this is anything but full-bodied. It coats the mouth, the throat, and pretty much everything it touches on the way down. Almost oily, with a light burn on the swallow that follows to the stomach. Maybe just a bit too close to actual bourbon, but still a fine complement to the flavor profile.
Drinkability, for what it is, is very good. The alcohol is prominent but not overwhelming, the flavors rich and decadent and alluring, though just a bit big for me to call inviting. This is truly reminiscent, though, of an excellent, even epic, coffee stout, with a bit of high-quality straight bourbon added. I would love - LOVE - to try the base stout with coffee and no bourbon, a la Nightstalker, only with the big hops replaced with espresso. I believe that might be close to a perfect 5 to me. 
A friend of mind has said before that whenever he's drinking Bourbon County, it's his favorite beer, and I can't help but agree. While this one falls just short of those heights, it's still a truly great beer. 2,951 charactersJohnQVegas, Jul 12, 2010

4.77/5  rDev +4.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 422oz bottle with a bottled on date of 3/26/10. The label reads this brew develops for up to 5 years in the bottle and should be served in a snifter. Into my favorite snifter it goes.
BCBCS appears black in color and only when held up to the light and swirled does it reveal any indications of dark brown instead of pitch black around the edges. The half finger of head that appears is stained a very dark brown color and dissolves quite fast. Faint spots of brown dots appear as the only sign of lacing on the glassware.
Aroma of this brew was a big robust scent of espresso straight out the gate. As soon as the cap was popped I could smell the dark roasty aroma of coffee before I even put my nose closer to it. As it sits in my snifter the scent is pleasant and bold with all sorts of roasty character. The dominating scent of espresso is equally met by a punishing amount of bourbon. In the back of the smell are some slight subtleties of vanilla, chocolate and some earthiness.
The taste of this brew is no disappointment. Once I settled down from how bold the nose was, I braced myself for the expectation of the flavor. Indeed, the flavors are just as dominating as the aroma. Upfront there is the unmistakable blend of strong espresso and a wallop of bourbon flavored heat that is slightly astringent. Through the body flavors less intense than the espresso and bourbon are suggested in the form of bitter dark chocolate and some woodsy oak flavors. There is a lingering melody of all things awesome about a bold stout that play on through the finish of this brew. It has tons of bitter dark roasted grain flavor mixed with coffee, bourbon and oak. However, there are also some semi sweet dark chocolate flavors and almost tangy earthiness thrown in there as well. The alcohol is so prominent and unhidden it has a bit of a numbing quality to it like you are drinking bourbon.
The feel of this brew is full and thick without being cloying or too chewy. The level of carbonation is moderately low but acceptable for the style. At times the sting of the prevalent alcohol makes this beer feel lighter than it really is. Drinkability is on par with others of the same class. A sipper to be enjoyed slowly for sure. The only negative thing I have to say would be that it might possibly be more drinkable with a little time on it. However, I wanted to experience this brew before any of coffee flavor had any chance to drop out.
As a person who loves coffee and appreciated a fine bourbon before discovering the finer things in beer, this brew is a homerun. I cannot wait to see what some time will do to the other bottles I have. While I am sure some of the coffee flavors will drop, it will be interesting to see what nuances have a chance to shine through once this brew as a whole starts to mellow out. 2,814 charactersstakem, Jul 10, 2010

This bottle was sent to me as an extra in a great trade with tytoanderso...so thank you too man!! Also have one more bottle at the moment from mikesgrove...so after I age it a bit...a big thanks to you as well!
Poured from a 22oz bottle with red label into my brandy snifter. Pours a dark black with a medium to dark brown creamy head that dissipates pretty quickly. Lacing is spotty, but creamy, sticky, and inviting!
Aroma is right where I expected it to be...lots of bourbon, like the orriginal. You can surprisingly get past the bourbon though and pick out the coffee. Heavy and dark roasted coffee beans, toasted malts...and because the bourbon is so strong, booze is a big factor!
Flavor is delicious! Thick and heavy mouthfeel, very low carbonation, and huge booze factor. Compared to the original, coffee added to this beer makes a great characteristic! Lots of bourbon, thick sugars...molasses, coffee, and even a slight vanilla present(I think). This is indeed a great beer, fortunate to try...and can't wait to try this aged! 1,135 charactersShadesOfGray, Jul 09, 2010

M - Medium bodied and malt/bourbon dominated. Creamy with no carbonation, but moderate amount of lingering warmth. Surprising that the coffee does not lend astringency to this beer.
D - I actually think the BCS is a better beer. Not saying I wouldn't try this again, but it really needs to age in order to reduce the warmt. 807 charactersMisterClean, Jul 07, 2010
4.85/5  rDev +5.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured in to Duvel tulip
B/O date: 3/26/10
A - Poured dark black with a half finger of espresso coloured head. 
S - Heavy bourbon nose with some vanilla. No real roasted malt at all. Some coffee in the background but not as much as I expected. 
T - Bourbon is predokminant up front but not overwhelming at all. Very smooth. A nice vanilla taste and some coffee, but again the coffee is not as predominant as expected. As I continued to drink this better it got better and better. It became so smooth and the bourbon lightened up some more allowing the roasted malt and coffee flavours to come through. Incredibly smooth for 13% ABV. 
M - Medium to heavy body. Thick, silky, chewy. amazing mouth feel.
D - A truly amazing beer that lived up to its hype. I will hunt this down annually. 789 charactersTheSevenDuffs, Jul 07, 2010
4.32/5  rDev -5.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 322oz bottle sent my way from RCL in a recent trade, thanks for the opportunity to try this one. A very nice 4th of July nightcap drank beside an 09 BCS
a- black as black gets. produced a nice mocha colored head, but it didn't stay around for long. to be fair, it did seem to be slowly eaten by the black 13% abyss more than your standard head dissipating. 
s- I have to say, I was hesitant to like this one when it first hit my nose. I guess it's been a while since I've had a Bourbon County and it is no doubt, an in your face beer. the more I smell it though, the more it grows on me. it reveals some surprisingly well melded aromas. the biggest thing to get around is the massive booze soaked dark fruit esters mixing with heavy oak and bourbon. the roast has more of a true coffee taste, rather than a mass amount of roasted malt seeming like coffee. the heavy oak is also pleasantly reminiscent of vanilla.
t- I hate to be so lazy with this review, but honestly, re-read the smell. the only difference is a bit more chocolate notes coming into play mid-palate and an even heavier bourbon influence. it is more impressive of the nose, if I have to can take anything away from the taste. it's awesome stuff.
m- chewy, chewy, chewy. seriously thick stuff. if I wasn't a stout fiend it would most certainly be to much...but since I just said I was, you know it's what I dream about. a welcomed low amount of carbonation. the alcohol warming is a bit strong for my liking.
d- good stuff that you love to sip on, but anything more than sipping is a bit of a stretch. big beers like this one are not to be messed with. luckily it's super tasty stuff or it would just be too much. 1,682 charactersFreethyhops, Jul 05, 2010
4.55/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Review from notes:
Standard BCS pour, thick, viscous, black in the glass, small dark head. My buddy said he spooged a little bit when he saw it. Haha!!
Aroma is full of chocolaty goodness, huge wafts of bourbon and vanilla, oak, fudge, roast, and only the slightest bit of coffee. Was expecting much more coffee.
Taste is right on with the nose. Creamy dark chocolate mixed with bourbon and vanilla. Lots of vanilla, surprisingly. Think bourbon balls. Coffee is also there, but like the nose, it's in small amounts and was really hoping for more. I realize the bottle is almost 4 months old, but I thought it would have more. Still delicious.
Mouthfeel is deep, full, sticky, sweet and chewy. Yum!!
I could have easily finished a bomber of this myself considering the high ABV was barely noticed and so damn delicious. Good thing I split this one up with 3 others and was glad to share. This great stuff but wish I had it fresh so as to distinguish it more from the regular offering. 988 charactersKeefD, Jul 04, 2010
4.85/5  rDev +5.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Unlike the regular BCS, Coffee Stout has a less alcoholic taste to it. I love BCS, but this is much more drinkable. Pours a dark black with little to no head. A touch of alochol bite up front, with a nice chocolately finish, real smooth. I really didn't taste the coffee as much as I thought I would, but it didn't take away from the quality. Overall a great beer. 364 charactersBF1977, Jul 04, 2010

Poured from a 750ml bottle in to a chimay chalice. 
Produced no head and poured a pitch black color, seriously dark beer.Smell on this one is serious bourbon followed by coffee and vanilla. This beer smells awesome.The taste is intense, big alcohol bite at first followed by coffee and chocolate and malt. The mouth-feel is bubbly and rich. drinkability is quite high for a beer at 13 percent. Over all i would definitely get this beer if i saw it in stores, its Awesome! 514 characterstrygger87, Jul 02, 2010

4.67/5  rDev +2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured from 650mL bottle into Goose Island flute.
A - Poured a silky smooth jet black with a thin mocha head with lacing that vanished pretty quickly.
S - The odor jumped from the glass during pour. The mix of black cat espreso with the bourbon is awesome. Smells sweet and inviting. Roasted dark chocolate comes to mind. Really smells nothing like a beer to me. A beautiful medly of odors that's really inviting.
T - Like BCS with coffee (duh)...but REALLY well balanced. Roasted malts and nuts are upfront and the bourbon flavor is more in the background, but the alcohol is very in your face IMHO. There is no doubt upon first sip that this one will knock you down before you polish it off.
M - Smooth, but with a bourbon bite. Has nice lively carbonation, but very well balanced. Leaves a bourbony tingle in my mouth. Very rich and filling.
D - Really tasty beer and a nice marriage of a few of my favorite things. Great for a special treat, but certainly not a session beer by any means. This one is strong and you can feel it. If that doesn't bother you, the flavor is killer, just a bit too boozy (but what would one expect for a bourbon stout?).

bottled on 1/11/12 # 1546
4.5 - 5 - 5 - 5 - 5
a - opened the bottle and filled my oversized SH IRS snifter. poured a lush oil black with a thin tan head that fizzed away in an instant leaving a ring around the glass. swirling the glass brings things back to life, but leaves really spotty lacing.
s - OH YEAH. that's it. the coffee is very present and compliments the BCBS perfectly.
t - YUM. such a great beer. the beans may be different from last year, but the taste is just as amazing as i remember it.
m - smooth and easy to drink...as all the BCBS varieties.
o - overall a winner. i wanted to try this fresh to death and with the bottle date just shy of a month, mission accomplished. i've heard some say that the coffee is a bit intense and it gets better as it fades a bit...i can definitely see this and look forward to revising in a short while.

4.5 - 5 - 5 - 5 - 5
a - filled my intelligentsia mini snifter, the brew was dark as a bad trader's soul, but has the barrel aged glisten of a LIF'er. no real head to speak of aside from some dark brown bubbling on the surface that is gone quick.
s - zippity doo dah! FRESH BCBCS...gotta love it. the coffee is really nice and fresh and dank smelling. super roasty and really rich and gourmet. smells like the coffee isle in fairway. SOOO GOOD. some great sweetness from the barrel.
t - wow, really nice. definitely an improvement from 2011 fresh, and about as solid as i remember 2010 being fresh. the coffee really shines through and it is a great flavor of coffee. strong and gourmet and rich. the BCBS is underneath, but the coffee is the star of this beer.
m - smooth and easy to drink. great coffee roast not roasted malts. the barrels are there and the booze is really well integrated.
o - overall, ANOTHER winner in this series. you just can't go wrong with BCBCS and this year is as good if not better than any other vintage fresh. cheers to GI for keeping it real. i just LOVE this beer. 3,379 characterscosmicevan, Jul 01, 2010

Poured a dark as night black that look like motor oil with a thin tan head that left good sticky lacing on the glass. The aroma was really nice with coffee notes that weren't over powering the nose. There was roasted malts, vanilla, dark fruits, oak and hints of bourbon and chocolate. It also had faint booze presence in the background. The flavors on this beer were amazing and complex consisting of chocolate, vanilla, and roasted malts with a good amount of bourbon that was well balanced in the mixture. Dark fruits, booze, and coffee were faint but still added accents to the overall taste. Very delicious beer. The brew was full bodied with a fair amount of carbonation that had a sweet creamy rich and roasty finish. This beer really knocked my socks off. Goose islands regular bourbon county is very good but this one is off the hook its amazing all around I hope I can get my hands on more. 960 charactersGobzilla, Jun 30, 2010

4.79/5  rDev +4.6%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5A - Poured out an opaque, jet black color with a thin tan head of foam. The foam left behind intricate patches of lace down the glass.
S - It smelled of chocolate, oak, bourbon and vanilla. There are notes of rich, dark coffee but it not nearly as strong as I expected from a "coffee stout".
T - The roasty, espresso-like coffee flavor came through stronger than its aroma. Also, it had delicious chocolate and toffee flavors with a strong yet not overpowering bourbon presence.
M - It was crisp, sharp and smooth. A big beer with a medium body. The alcohol heat is present but not over the top.
D - Goose Island did a really amazing job on this one. The bourbon is not too much, nor is the coffee. It is just a really delicious imperial stout with crazy good flavors. 772 characterszeff80, Jun 29, 2010

4.52/5  rDev -1.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Bottled on 3/26/10
Poured right down the center into a Portsmouth tulip glass. Forms a thin, tan head on top of a black body. Patches of lacing left behind. Good for a beer of this strength.
Lots of coffee and bourbon up front. Wood barrels and vanilla add to the complexity of the nose. Sweet, roasted dark malts linger in the background. A well rounded mix of espresso, vanilla and bourbon.
Much like the nose. Dark espresso notes with a slow bourbon burn on the tongue. Vanilla, oak and chocolate malts. Sweet, yet roasty bitterness. Hops still come through a bit from the base beer. Warming alcohol mixes with chocolate, espresso and bourbon.
Mouthfeel is slick, smooth and creamy with a good amount of warming alcohol. Lingering bitterness, yet sweet at the same time. Bittersweet. Chewy, but not too viscous. Excellent.
This is a huge beer and definitely a sipper. Drinkability is actually quite good for what this is. The flavor and mouthfeel make this a treat to drink. The 13% ABV slows things down a bit, but is perfect for a cold night by the fire. Splitting a bomber is perfect.
Overall, this is an excellent bourbon stout. Goose Island does great things with their barrels. Having this fresh, I'm not sure if it's much better than the regular Bourbon County, but the coffee does add another dimension that is quite good and could possibly aid in the aging of this beer. I'll probably crack my other bottle about 3 years down the road from now. Good stuff. 1,474 characterssisuspeed, Jun 29, 2010
4.25/5  rDev -7.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Poured up like you'd expect from the BCS. Scents of raisins, licorice, coffee and bourbon (in order of ascending presence). The coffee does wonders for adding a little complexity to the beer, BCS is real heavy on the bourbon flavor while the coffee flavor cuts it a little bit. There's some brown sugar and vanilla that come out as the bourbon is subdued. I thought this was delicious and it was nice to have a beer that more or less met expectations, I've had a lot of misses lately. This was great, split 3 ways I wish I had a little more. Overall really nice. 562 charactersliquidcraft, Jun 28, 2010
4.5/5  rDev -1.7%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Bottle purchased at GI Wrigley on 6/12/2010.
Pours oily thick jet black with some dark mocha bubbly head. Big legs down the side of the glass.
Aroma was, as expected, dominated by coffee giving off hints of deep dark chocolate and cherry, with some big vanilla notes as well. As it warmed, the molasses became more prevalent and offered a great balance to the roastiness.
While I love BCS with a couple years of age, the BCBCS was absolutely perfect fresh out of the bottle. The nutty roasted notes really cut into the sometimes overpowering bourbon of regular BCS, but this brew is perfectly balanced. As it warmed, the vanilla really came forward as the coffee took a back seat for the finish.
While this didn't drink like 13%, it is no doubt a sipper. The big buttery mouthfeel was fantastic, and I only got slight burn from the alcohol.
Overall, this was one of the best beers I have ever had. i'm glad I didn't have to share the bottle and had no problem putting it away during the US. vs. England game. Well done, GI! 1,028 charactersChrisPro, Jun 28, 2010
4.33/5  rDev -5.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Big thanks to Dan/ATLbeerDog for grabbing me a bottle while he was in Chicago recently. Pours an ink black color into my snifter, with a thin dark tan head. Excellent lacing, and dense looking body, no surprise given BCS well deserved reputation. I'm a bit disappointed by the aroma, it's good, don't get me wrong, but I love a powerful (and delicious) coffee aroma in my coffee stouts, and while its there, this beer is just so big, it doesn't come through the same way some of a big favorites do. A heated alcohol somewhat masks the coffee... not to mention bourbon. The taste certainly falls in line with the aroma.There is sweet molasses and chocolate sweetness up front with bourbon and coffee (nicely paired with with some heavily roasted malts) coming out more as it warms up and primarily in the finish. Much like BCS, the mouthfeel is thick and creamy, wonderful. Excellent beer, I wish I had more than one, as I'd love to age it, but I fear further loss of coffee in aging, so I had to drink it reasonably soon. I would love for the intense heat to subside, so that some of the other characteristics could come through further. Just not sure if that is going to happen, since in my experiences, coffee fades, much like, but maybe to not the same degree, as hops. 1,272 charactersbhalter8, Jun 25, 2010
4.26/5  rDev -7%look: 3 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured into a Bruery tulip glass at roughly 51 degrees Fahrenheit.
A: Poured with some carbonation and head, but eventually died down into a dark and still liquid. One of those beers that exhibits no lacing, but is still able to stain the glass. 
S: Strong bourbon sweetness and acidity along with molasses, caramel, toffee, roasted nut, vanilla, anise and a mild coffee/espresso character that helps kill some of that alcohol burn. 
T: Holds true to the original BCS flavors, but the added coffee ingredients help tone down and accentuate the underlying flavors. I know that may sound like an oxymoron, but it does. Lots of molasses, brown sugar, bourbon, vanilla, and wood encompass most of the flavor profile.
M: Thick, sticky, low carbonation, and clingy.
D: The flavor is so intense that I could only enjoy roughly 12 oz. of this beer at a time. 
Overall: Better than BCS, but not by much. A must try. Cheers! 920 charactersOlieIPA, Jun 25, 2010
3.93/5  rDev -14.2%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Served in a Dogfish Head snifter.
Major League psyched to randomly find this one 'round my primary bar! Let's delve in, shall we? It pours a beastly pitch black topped by about a finger of fizzy, dark tan foam, which, sadly, dies away rather quickly. The nose comprises oak, bourbon, coffee, light vanilla, and nothing else. Period. For something this big, I expected more than this. The taste holds notes of dark roasted malts, a shit-ton of bourbon, oak, chocolate, light vanilla, light coffee, and a tiny bit o' bitterness. Honestly, I felt that, like the normal BCS, the bourbon was kinda overpowering, and, in this case, the coffee was strangely, haphazardly tossed into the trunk and forgotten until a few days into the vacation, by which time the sunburn is so bad that the sunscreen in the bag has been rendered pointless. You know what I mean? Simply put: too much bourbon, not enough coffee; good, but disappointing to say the least. The body is a heavy medium, with a moderate carbonation, a slight oral coating, and a very smooth feel. Overall, a tasty beast, but definitely not what I was told it would be. 1,120 charactersTMoney2591, Jun 24, 2010
2.87/5  rDev -37.3%look: 3 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3 | feel: 2.5 |  overall: 222oz bomber poured into my snifter
The appearance was opaque black with no light able to penetrate through this black beast of a stout. The pour produced a mere half inch head that was of a slightly light brown color. Poor head retention that was below average with no lacing either. 
The aroma was strong in the bourbon department which almost overpowered the other aromas to shine through. Besides the bourbon being the dominate smell I got a decent amount of oak, molasses, tobacco, roasted malts on the charred side, black leather, and surprisingly the espresso is hardly noticeable.
The taste upfront was that of bourbon which pretty much hits your palette with a bang. Coming in is a sweetness with hints of black licorice, sugar, and dark chocolate. In the finish is where the espresso finally comes into play with a pretty intense alcohol heat and slight burn in the back.
Mouthfeel is full bodied with average carbonation. Alcohol burn lingers way beyond you have taken your sip.
Overall I was HUGELY disappointed with this beer. This beer is basically a Bourbon County Stout with added sweetness to it. The espresso in this beer hardly came through and needed to play a more dominate role, instead what you got was another bourbon bomb. If you truly want to try a good espresso based beer, I would rather recommend Great Divide-Espresso Oak Aged Yeti. 1,366 characterstr4nc3d, Jun 23, 2010
4.54/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Finally broke down and decided to try this one for the first time. Poured from a 750ml bottle into several snifter installments.
A - As black as night. A gorgeous looking espresso/hazlenut color lacing around the edges. After a slight swirl, a small yet enticing head forms enhancing the espresso color.
S - Wow. Just wow. Smells of bourbon and vanilla, coffee and dark sugars. Getting an almost dark fruit smell as well. Obviously the dark roasted malts are present as well. A slight alcohol scent lets you know that it is a hefty beer.
T - Everything is so well integrated. Molasses, dark fruit, bourbon, vanilla, coffee. For a non coffee lover, the espresso comes through in the perfect way. It is not overpowering and not subtle. It is so well mixed into everything else that is going on. The bourbon flavors are the same story. Nothing overwhelms, instead everything complements the other ingredients working together in the best way possible.
M - Velvety, smooth, silky, yet thick at the same time. Not syrupy in a "I want to pour this over pancakes way," but in a way that would make me want to curl up in front of a fire during the winter and drink this one. 
D - The high ABV makes it a tougher one to try to get through, but to be honest, the taste and smell kept me coming back for each sip. I got through the entire 750ml bottle without noticing the alcohol hitting me the way a 13% beer normally would.
If you can get your hands on it, do so. It is one of the best tasting barrel aged beers I have ever tasted, and hopefully you feel the same. 1,562 charactersKAP1356, Jun 23, 2010
4.92/5  rDev +7.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Appearance-Pours an oily dark almost-black brown into the glass, a small bubbling brown head rises but quickly bubbles away with a carbony hiss until all that remains is a foamy ring, no real lacing along the sides to speak of but given that it's a 13% beer that's to be expected. Looks pretty solid.
Aroma-I smell the espresso beans upfront followed by strong bourbon notes which mingle to form a very pleasant scent; on the outskirts I can detect cocoa and dark toffee but by in large the aroma is dominated by espresso and bourbon.
Taste-Oooh, so smooth. I get coffee soaked toffee notes upfront followed by cocoa with the bourbon taking something of a backseat forming a kind of 'flavor bowl' that everything else sits in so to speak. It's as though the bourbon rather than standing out and dominating on its own shows its presence through its influence upon all the other flavors if that makes any sense. As I swallow I get a pleasant acidic coffee-like flavor that sits itself on the back of my tongue and lingers that serves as a kind of final note at the end of each sip. This beer is complex, and tasty to say the least.
Mouthfeel-Not quite as plush as it could be, but still very nice.
Drinkability-I have to keep constantly reminding myself to drink this one slowly, this can go down dangerously fast for 13%.
Notes-I got this bottle at the insistence of my local distributor, according to him they barely managed to get a case of this and due to their limited supply and the beer's popularity were only selling one per customer. I was wary of getting it as to be honest I'm not really a fan of the regular bourbon county stout, I find the bourbon notes of it too overpowering but he insisted I grab a bottle of this while I had the chance. Thankfully I took his advice and now I'm glad I got the chance to try this excellent beer; should you ever see it around I say grab it. 1,892 charactersManoftyr, Jun 19, 2010
4.47/5  rDev -2.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.522 oz. bottle courtesy of steve8robin - many thanks! Poured in to a 22 oz. snifter.
Appearance: Pours a seal brown, a thick void of a body, viscous and oily as it chugs out of the neck of the attractively labeled 22 oz. bottle (note: I do really like the new GIBCS labels, despite being really resistant to label changes generally - their understated simplicity fits this beer very well). A mildly aggressive pour coaxes nearly two full fingers of non-uniformly hued head out of the depths, flecked by mottled patches of various shades of cocoa and dark tan. The head disappears as quickly as it came though, fizzing and popping and dropping down to only the thinnest wisp of surface lace - a drop in the sea, really - and a pencil-thin necklace of foam around the edges of the glass. As you can imagine, successive sips leave no hint of lacing clinging to the side of the glass, but on the whole - as far as 13% abv barrel aged beers go - this one's solid.
Aroma: Pungent as hell, and with all the elements of regular GIBCS, but with an extra toasty, earthy kick. Understandably, this one's malty as all get out - huge cocoa powder, baker's chocolate, toast, and dark toffee intermingle with french roast coffee, slightly charred, a little dirty, but it does a great job of complimenting the existing malt bill. There's tons of vanilla in the nose, too, which - along with slight coconut and a nice dose of wood - do as much as they possibly can to cover up what will always be GIBCSs biggest downside in my opinion: the overwhelmingly strong bourbon note, spicy and dominant, though smoother and less hot here than in the original. 
Taste: Beautiful and luxurious. Velvety malts - slick and smooth because of the espresso oils - ranging from dark caramel (probably mostly wood sugars) to toffee to bittersweet chocolate to toast to, yes, surprise, espresso roast coffee. Dark fruits - raisins mainly - intermingle well with the fruity notes leeched from the wood. The coffee really does fill in a few blanks in the malt profile here, adding some nice, pungent, strongly flavored deep coffee notes, slightly creamy (courtesy of the sweetness and wood sugars - lactose sugars?), slightly sweet (courtesy of the lighter and unattenuated malts), but also very dark, slightly dirty, pretty earthy, and very well toasted. It almost takes on a coffee liqueur-esque tone as it warms, with the sweetness mingling well with the earthiness of the coffee and the slight warmth of the bourbon. Speaking of, the bourbon itself is - as always, of course - strong, spicy, and warming but not hot, with a lot of the heat being absorbed or perhaps masked well by the coffee notes. The barrel contributes a few spare sugar notes (discussed above) as well as the aforementioned coconut and plenty of warm vanilla sugar. A very well-rounded tasting brew.
Mouthfeel: Not nearly as thick as you would imagine it could be - what with the amount of malts you'd have to throw in to the fermentation vessel to get 13% out of this one - and I assume that's largely a result of the spirit addition as well as the coffee infusion, which also lends a nice amount of slick oilyness (as if one needs help making GIBCS go down any quicker, right?). The amount of carbonation in here - in conjunction with the thinness - makes it a little uneven initially (feels sort of erratic, fizzy, which was suggested by the head, discussed above), but after the carbonation dies down a little, it becomes nicer, a little smoother, still slick, but in an even, creamy way. Half-point bump. 
Drinkability: A step up over the classic GIBCS? Perhaps. A different take? Certainly. It's a little cleaner, fresher, more rounded, and more "full" than the original GIBCS, if that makes sense, with the coffee addition doing a lot of good - smoothing out the body, filling in the malt base, cutting down on the alcohol heat in places - but also necessarily having its downsides (the increased slickness and thinning out of the body foremost, in my opinion). Definitely worth seeking out, though I wish they offered it in the 12 oz. bottles like the original - 22 oz. is tough for this one, especially if you're doing it on your own! A sipper, or one to share with friends or pair with a rich (and large) dessert. One of the best beers I've had in a while. 4,307 charactersCrellMoset, Jun 19, 2010
4.54/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Appearance: The bottle is very simplistic and nice, great presentation. Pours a thick, almost oily pitch black with about a finger of dark chocolate head, which fizzes almost like soda. Within a minute it has almost all disappeared, leaving a tiny ring around the edge of the glass, and by the second minute after the pour it looks entirely still with just the faintest wisps of dark chocolate left floating around on the top. Getting closer to the brew, I literally saw one minuscule carbonation bubble moving to the top of the glass. Looks to be a very solid color, and for some reason, in some way, looks cold. No lacing to be seen. 
Smell: Smells extremely strongly of bourbon, even from a couple of feet away. Extremely strong smelling overall and clears out your sinuses--I can only imagine what's in store once I take a sip. Hints of mint, anise and coffee, as well as a smooth vanilla scent. I don't get as much coffee out of this as I would have expected--to me it smells predominantly of cocoa powder and bourbon. Some nice roasted malts are there as well as some fairly strong oak notes, which balance out the bourbon heat and mintiness nicely. As it warms, some espresso and stronger dark roast notes.
Taste: Though not the dominant taste, the first thing I get from this beer is dark fruit notes--bourbon drenched raisins and cherries. There's some nice dark chocolate and dark roast bitterness in the taste as well. These two are nicely balanced by the dark fruits as well as a hint of vanilla and roasted malts. As it warms the coffee and chocolate get a lot stronger, but the raisins are really particularly standing out as well. 80% dark chocolate in the aftertaste and then a hint of whipped cream and chocolate syrup. Slightest amount of bourbon heat in the background--it definitely takes the back seat here to other flavors, but is still present enough to make an impression and blend nicely. Slight oak, leather, licorice, and coconut. A little hotter and slightly peppery as it warms. 4.5
Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel is decent. The carbonation isn't in your face, and is made up of fine crisp bubbles that make themselves present at the beginning of the sip but die down by the end. They are just enough to lift the flavors of the brew up. For a thick-bodied and heavy brew, they do a great job of providing just enough carbonation and lift and keeping the brew otherwise smooth and creamy. Slight alcohol warmth in the aftertaste but not overly abrasive. Not really sure what else could be done--it would be interesting to try this one with more carbonation but I'm not sure that it would be a huge improvement. As it is, pretty excellent. I will edit this later on in the drinking process as it's sat a bit--it's gone slightly flat, so I'd say that my earlier comment about perhaps having more carbonation stands. I'd say though that the level of carbonation is probably good, and that it mostly just needs to be more sustained throughout the drinking process.
Drinkability is pretty great. The high ABV doesn't stop this one from going down smoothly, and it manages to be creamy and not very hot. Pretty surprisingly good in this category and would probably be delicious aged. It drinks more like a 6% than a 13%. Nicely done. 3,253 charactersafausser, Jun 19, 2010
4.79/5  rDev +4.6%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured into a snifter. Big thanks to stonequarrywest for this one.
3.5 A: Black color. One finger of frothy brown head with poor retention and not really any lacing.
4.5 S: Bourbon is the dominant aroma, but there's plenty else going on. Coffee is dark roasted and quite complementary. Good balance of roasted barley with sweet, viscous toffee notes from caramel malts.
5.0 T: Pretty much as good as it gets. This is easily my favorite bourbon barrel aged brew. Bourbon level is perfect as it neither dominates nor lays in the background. Alcohol is warming throughout and especially on finish. Bourbon does its job in that regard as well. Sweet toffee, blackstrap molasses, raisin, plum, and a touch of currants is balanced by a slightly stronger coffee and roasted barley roastiness.
5.0 M: Thick, viscous body, but is relatively light on the tongue. Good moderate carbonation. Very creamy and silky with a smooth, though warming, finish.
5.0 D: As far as bourbon beers go, this is the king of the hill. Awesome taste and mouthfeel contribute for a great drinkability. No signs of off flavors, just smooth drinking throughout. 1,133 charactersDavoleBomb, Jun 19, 2010
4.22/5  rDev -7.9%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Poured from 22oz bottle. Another one of Lukafer's bottles....geeze Luke...that's all I have.
A- Pours a inky black color. Half finger mocha colored head that dies as soon as it peaks. No lacing on the sides of the glass.
S- Nice coffee upfront with a light bourbon backing. Roasted malts with a hint of vanilla. Some light oaky notes with a little bittersweet chocolate backing once it warms. It reminds me of Bourbon County (duh) with more oaky notes and light coffee notes. 
T- Light coffee upfront that I think is more roasted malts than actual coffee. Vanilla flavors come in with a light chocolate flavor giving a creamy feel. Bourbon is not as in your face like normal Bourbon County. Oaky flavors toward the middle with a coffee ground taste toward the end. Alcohol is not very aggresive but still there in the end. 
M- Heavy mouthfeel. Carbonation is good for the style. Roasted malts and some light bourbon notes left on the palate with warming alcohol in the aftertaste. Flavors are bold and aggresive but still blend very well. Heavy drying on the palate. Clean tasting with no off flavors. 
D- This is a good drinking beer. Overall I must admit that I prefer Bourbon County more. Interested to see what becomes of this beer when it gets a year or two on it. Goose Island has been making some standout beers lately and this is no exception. Good job guys! The only downfall is the higher ABV doesn't make this a big drinker. 1,440 charactersalleykatking, Jun 18, 2010

Appearance- Pours the standard opaque black with a small half finger or so of brown head that dies almost immediately back to a ring. No real lacing.
Smell- Huge nose. I get bitter espresso up front followed closely thereafter by the bourbon smells I expect from BCBS. Vanilla and wood make a particular impression, along with bitter chocolate and lots of rich roast.
Taste- Very big and very complex. Again, I get the bitter espresso and coffee grounds up front, followed again by the vanilla and wood. However, here I also get some tobacco, leather, lots more bitter chocolate, and the big roast. Finishes on a note of warming alcohol.
Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Mouthfeel is adequately thick and carbonated and drinkability is respectable for such a sipper of a big beer. Got a little tough towards the end of my glass but I certainly didn't mind.
Overall, a first rate beer. Performed well against KBS, though I will say it didn't blow it out of the water as much as I was expecting. That being said, very much enjoyed and try it if you get the chance. 1,240 charactersboatshoes, Jun 17, 2010

A - Poured an oily black liquid with a hint of hazelnut coloration around the edges and a sparse burnt mocha head that quickly dispersed, diminishing to a slender ring around the rim of the glass.
S - While the bourbon presence is obvious right off the bat, there is also a dominant roasted malt and coffee character as well as some caramel sweetness in the mix. A hint of bitter chocolate also emerges as the liquid reached room temperature.
T - Overall, the bourbon isn't as potent compared to the original Bourbon County Stout, due to the presence of the coffee and chocolate notes, which quell the alcohol warmth. An underlying caramel malt sweetness is present throughout. Finishes with an earthy hop tinge and bitter chocolate notes. 
M - Very lively, prickly carbonated mouthfeel with a sticky but smooth and creamy texture and moderate alcohol warmth on the palate. 
D - Very, very good Imperial Stout and definitely on par with the standard version. Definitely a contender for one of the top coffee stouts out there. Yum! 1,094 charactersffejherb, Jun 15, 2010

A - Pours a pitch black color with a thin finger of fizzy cappuccino foam that dies quickly to a thin collar and some swirling islands of bubbles on the surface of the beer. No lacing left behind on the glass.
S - Rich aromas - filled with dark roasted coffee up front, as expected. Noticeable alcohol enters the aroma too blending with milk and dark chocolates. Hints of vanilla and caramel too. The aromas all blend together really well here.
T - Sweet milk chocolate up front with the bitter espresso and coffee flavors backing it up. Big hit of alcohol although tame when compared to fresh BCBS bottles. Caramel is bigger than the aroma. Vanilla is found throughout. Oak and bourbon are subtley in the background. Some light citrusy fruit appears after the swallow and lingers around until the next sip.
M - Full bodied...feels rich and creamy with a medium level, fine bubbled carbonation. Lightish alcohol warmth...definitely not a burn though. Very smooth for a high alcohol, bourbon barrel aged stout that is shy of 3 months in the bottle. A little time should really smooth this one out...too bad they are so hard to get.
D - Having this 22 with dinner...holds up well throughout, but not sure I could have much more in a sitting. Flavors are intense and really good. Alcohol level is high, definitely noticeable too. This doesn't detract from the experience, even enhances it, but makes it hard to drink a lot of. Probably a good idea not to push the limits with this one. 1,622 charactersportia99, Jun 13, 2010

11oz in a Newport Storm pint glass, thanks to the incredibly-generous Rempo.
A- Dark dark brown, minimal 1cm head that quickly dissapates, and this is with an aggressive pour. Still, wasn't expecting a ton here. Seems to be low-carbed.
S- Bourbon, vanilla, creamed coffee. 
T- Bourbon is so smooth. Caramel, vanilla, and of course, coffee. Sweet, semi-sweet chocolate. Coffee is mellow and smooth, almost like coffee ice cream.
M- This is where the beer shines- impossibly smooth and so delicious. Lots of mellow, smooth, rich flavors that work very well. Low carbonation makes this like velvet. Can't believe it- 5 of 5. 
D- Moderately high. Worth seeking out, a great beer. Here's hoping it comes back again.

Pours black, brown head is pinky-size. Not that it really matters, but this somehow retained better and had nicer lacing than regular BCS.
Smell is incredible, best part of the beer IMO. One of the best-smelling stouts I have had. Bourbon, vanilla and roasted malt mix excellently with dark espresso.
Taste is very good, close to the scent. Bourbon, vanilla, burnt chocolate, smoke and coffee. Coffee isn't as up-front as I thought it would be, the strength of the beer is definitely the nice mixture of flavors. Booze is still a bit hot but not as hot as regular BCS. Espresso flavor really starts to show through more as it warms.
Mouthfeel is great, smooth and creamy. Carbonation is nice and low. A bit thinner than I remember regular BCS being, it could be my imagination. Excellent taste makes this more drinkable than a 13% stout should be. 932 charactersChico1985, Jun 12, 2010

Smells of roasted malts, coffee, wood, and vanilla with a heavy bourbon presence. The coffee is there, but not nearly as dominate as I expected.
Taste is slightly sweet roasted malts, molasses, and brown sugar up front. The finish is a mix of bourbon, coffee, and chocolate with a moderate bitterness. Whereas some coffee stouts have a watered down, burnt coffee flavor, this is much richer and provides an excellent, unique flavor. The bitter coffee, chocolate and bourbon linger past the finish. Bourbon flavor is nicely balanced.
Full bodied, syrupy, and sticky with no chewiness. Dry finish with a light alcohol heat.
Overall an excellent beer, but I wasn't blown away.

The taste is chocolate, coffee, bourbon, vanilla, and raisins. It has a lot of sweetness and also bitterness from the coffee for some balance, but is still mostly sweet. The chocolate and coffee flavors together is what makes this beer work for me. The chocolate flavor is similar to Hershey's syrup, and reminds me of Black Tuesday.
The beer clings to the glass much like Ten FIDY, is full bodied, chewy, smooth, and has decent carbonation. The alcohol is not well hidden, but I did not expect it to be. This is a very nice Imperial Stout,and keeps getting better as it warms in the glass. 759 charactershardy008, Jun 11, 2010
4.34/5  rDev -5.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4The label on this bottle says "develops up to 5 years in the bottle". As this will probably be my 1 and only, no chance of me waiting.
Youza, another hefty 13% abv brew. What was I thinking??
First off, gotta give some love to Goose Island before even tasting this; the bottle is filled nearly to the brim.
It looks pitch black to me, has a small half inch of tannish foam, and does a good job re the lacing. A great looker.
The smell, as expected from the name, has a nice long lasting aroma of coffee followed closely by a steady but not over the top nose of bourbon. Nice, and I get some sweetish notes ala milk chocolate that intensify and almost match the bourbon and coffee as I take more whiffs. This has the smell department down to a T. Love it!
The taste starts off very much with the bourbon, maybe a tad too much. Cellaring would probably calm that down over time but I can't ignore the the lovely sweet chocolate and fresh coffee notes that come along for the ride. Ok, maybe it is also a tad too sweet for my liking as well. I'm being a real hard nose right now, I guess, but I'm thinking about the "regular" Bourbon Co Stout and thinking how wonderful it is, especially with a year on it. This *could* turn out equally as impressive in a year or so but....for me, fresh is tasty and all but it doesn't have that certain harmony of flavours going on that I hoped for. No disrespect to Goose Island intended. See my reviews of many of their other beers for proof of my love for the brewery.
Medium bodied, lowish carbonation, the mouthfeel is fantastic.
Drinkability? Despite my perceived short comings of BCS Coffee edition, it is *still* any easy drinking 13%ABV monster.
Give it a go. 1,707 charactersBitterbill, Jun 11, 2010

A hugely deep dark menace of a beer. Creamy, thick, full, tan, mocha brown head rose 2 fingers and had great retention and thick sticky lacing to boot.
Wow. This is huuuugely flavorful. The aromas are intense, but the flavors are even more so. Coffee and bourbon smack you in the face with subtle bluntness (yeah, that's right). Some chocolate hides in there as well, as well as a faint hint of black licorice. The smell is big. It is fitting. A big old sip reveals a sweet boozy bourbon over chocolate flavor that just seems to coalesce with the coffee. Like every choco-bourbon molecule is wrapped around a nucleus of coffee and oak. The mouthfeel is thick and creamy-- the way a good oak-aged stout should be. It actually has a bit of dryness towards the finish that really takes the edge off the bourbon--- like putting out the fire but leaving the warmth. There is a great Vanilla bean vibe here too. It mixes with the oakiness and the two really add quite a bit of taste and complexity.
There is a good amount of carbonation in this one. It is a little less than I like, but, this is a coffee beer that is aged in bourbon barrels, so I can deal with it. Other than that, there isn't really a valid complaint that I can make about this beer... And believe me, I wanted to make a valid complaint. I kind of wanted to be that homestate guy that gives this a less than an A review. Sorry, this beer deserves its great rating. It is fantastic. That coffee and chocolate note is just rocking my world.
Congrats to Goose. You knocked it out of the park on this one! And congrats to the Hawks. Now I just need my Cubs to pull it off... 1,695 charactersAleWatcher, Jun 10, 2010

Bottle dated 3/26/10.
Poured into a tulip.
A: Pours an oily jet black darkness with one finger of brownish caramel head. Very thick with no chance for light to get through. No real lacing, only a thin brown ring around the tulip.
S: Sweet chocolate, roasted espresso, and vanilla. One of if not the best smelling stouts I've every smelled. Very little bourbon - especially in comparison to the regular BCBS. It smells like a freshly baked brownie amongst some roasted malts and coffee. Before I even taste this beer, I realized this one is not just hype.
T: Tastes like a fudge brownie dipped in some coffee and espresso. Rich and chocolaty. Some heat here, but very good. Vanilla notes smooth out this beer. Almost everything in the smell is represented in the taste. World class and definitely lives up to its recent following.
M: Full body and low carbonation - ideal for the style. Bourbon and espresso lingers on the palette. 
D: Wonderful stout. The espresso and bourbon play wonderfully into this beer. The heat is the only limit to this beer's drinkability. 1,100 characterskirkpjr, Jun 09, 2010

Pours a deeper black than I was expecting and it had a short-lived light brown head. If I wasn't holding the cold bottle, it would have seemed more like a deep black espresso being poured straight from the espresso maker. 
Wow! Definitely some freshly roasted espresso, rich chocolate, and quality bourbon aromas up front. Powerful nose just from the pour, didn't even need to shove my face into my glass.
Amazing taste of chocolate maltiness, roasted espresso (with a smooth bitterness), and very balanced amount of bourbon. Slightly sweet and surprisingly creamy. As the beer warms to room temp, some licorice becomes apparent. Bourbon heat on the finish but alcohol is extremely masked overall. 
Mouthfeel was heavenly and beyond velvety. Like drinking a slightly thicker choc milk but not quite a milkshake. The best mouthfeel I've ever had from a stout. Drinks like an 8%
I should have bought a whole case!

EDIT: This beer seems to have faded exceptionally quickly. I tried 4 or 5 bottles over a couple of months and each was hotter / more bourbony / less coffee than the last. I still like it a lot, but this is one beer that should be consumed fresh, IMO. Scores adjusted slightly to reflect how a bottle is drinking today. 
A: Pours a pitch black color with a dark mocha colored head. Great retention for the ABV and style. It leaves some fringes of lace down the glass at first, but none in the latter half of the glass. 
S: Roasted malt, dark chocolate, coffee, and THEN bourbon. That's how it should be (IMO). Unlike BCBS, the barrel character has receded a bit and the base beer shines through more. Vanilla, oak, and a twinge -- just a bit -- of booze. Nonetheless, one of the best barrel-aged impy stouts I've smelled. 
T: I wouldn't call this 'balanced' in the grand scheme of beers, but as far as barrel-aged imperial stouts go, it has a number of flavors, and each one has its place. Unlike BCBS, it has much more restraint on the bourbon barrel -- or rather, the bourbon is appropriately balanced by coffee here. Plenty of dark chocolate. Restrained vanilla, oak, and a touch of molasses. I really enjoy the full flavor of this. I honestly like this more than KBS. 
M: Medium-full bodied. This is not a particularly thick stout (which is a good thing; it enhances its drinkability greatly). The cabonation is velvety and lovely. The only ding is that it is still quite hot; I don't know why anyone would say it has no heat at all. At least it's not a 13% blazing heat. I think this beer will hit my personal sweet spot in 6 months. I look forward to it. 
D: It's a testament to how much I love this beer that I have traded for it twice. I estimate each bomber cost me $16 including shipping. That's fine. It's that. damn. good. And I had no trouble finishing it on my own. 
Overall: well done. I don't feel that I'm lenient towards barrel-aged imperial stouts. This one really earned its score. 2,081 charactersArbitrator, Jun 07, 2010

M- pretty hot, but nice and thick and creamy, which is the way I like my stouts.
D- at 13%, the drinkability goes down quite a bit. for the alcohol I would say its pretty good, although pretty hot at the same time. again, wish there was more coffee. slightly disappointing given the hype for this beer. i would like to do a side by side with same year the regular bourbon county stout to see the difference. 930 charactersdrink1121, Jun 07, 2010

Poured from a bomber and split 3 ways. Dark black, not the thickest imperial stout ever but its pretty viscous stuff. Medium brown head. The aroma is lots and lots of bourbon, oak, coffee, raisin and bitter chocolate. I was worried after the nose that the bourbon barrel would overpower the other flavors but it did not. The main progression of flavors was fairly linear to me with a few subtleties that are harder to place. The main progression goes bourbon, dark chocolate syrup, bitterness from the hops, then coffee followed by a lingering coffee aftertaste that's nearly indistinguishable from the aftertaste of a good cup of coffee. Subtleties throughout of anise, oak, and some dark fruitiness that is raisin-like as in the nose. Feel is creamy, thick, and warming but just not quite thick enough for a 5. While probably not a good idea I would have no problem polishing off an entire bomber of this stuff, something I don't say too often about big beers like this. The past few weeks I've had a handful of highly hyped beers that turned out to be letdowns so it was really nice to be blown away again by a great beer. 1,292 charactersShumista, Jun 04, 2010

Color is black as it gets with a super fizzy coffee color head that isnt there long.
Smell is pretty crazy. I get some raspberries at first. Not present in regular bourbon county stout. a bourbon barrel twang to it. Dark red wine smells as well. Some vanilla syrup, and ohh yeah coffee.
Taste has way more coffee than the nose would leave you to believe. Almost light on the front of the tongue with carbonation, but is medium to heavy bodied overall especially when it warms up. Getting some bourbon flavor as well vanilla. Has a nice coffee bitterness to it. A great beer no doubt. 622 charactersspoons, Jun 04, 2010

A: Dark brownish black, syrupy, legs like Tina Turner. Virtually no head on it, but it might have been my pour.
S: Captivating. Bourbon-y chocolate goodness with an almost molasses-like sweetness. Bourbon overwhelms any coffee scent it might have had pre-barrel.
T: Delicious. This is one of those beers that you take your time with. Not because it's 13%, but because you want it to last, and as it warms slightly, more flavors make themselves known. Very slight coffee taste quickly overwhelmed by oaky bourbon flavor, chocolate. Sweet but balanced. Pronounced alcohol burn doesn't detract.
M: Sticky but smooth and thick. Nothing to complain about here.
D: I would have no trouble drinking a couple bombers of this if they were more readily available and priced for mere mortals like myself.
Overall I'd call this an excellent stout and I certainly won't pass on the opportunity to enjoy another. 1,050 characterstherealnomayo, Jun 03, 2010

A- Pours solid black. No light passes through at all. A fingers worth of a tannish head. Excellent retention and a solid amount of lacing.
S- Str8 up, in your grill, BOURBON. The charred malts and dark chocolate are present, but are supressed mainly by booze. I didn't pick up on any coffee at all.
T- Wow....I hate to say it, but I'm really disapointed. The bourbon is way to overpowering for me. Once again though the bourbon is just to hot. Weird because if I'm drinking liquor, I'm drinking Makers Mark, Gentleman Jack, or crown. Perhaps I should have chilled this brew a little longer before cracking it. I typicaly enjoy my stouts close to room temperature, so I had this just around room temp. The booze were just to much and it killed the other flavors in the beer. The only other thing I picked up on was the charred malts. No vanilla, no coffee, no chocolate. I really prefer regular BCS over this. I have one more bottle that I'm gonna let mellow out and I'll see what happens after some time has been put on this. I enjoy most BA stouts....I think this one just needs a little time.
M- Nice and creamy, but the heat from the booze killed it for me once again.
D- If you have read my review up to this point, you probably are going to guess what I'm going to say here...Yup u guessed it, just to boozey and hot. I'm anxious to revisit this brew in a year or so. 1,412 charactersurwithdave, Jun 03, 2010

S: The smell is incredible with in your face notes of coffee, chocolate and soy sauce and slight hints of vanilla and bourbon.
T: Amazingly complex. I don't think I have ever had a beer as complex as this. It starts out with a strong coffee flavor followed by bourbon with some heat. This heat however, is not over the top at all. Bourbon and chocolate stay on the tongue after each sip. There are also hints of vanilla, oak, soy sauce and chocolate found throughout the brew.
M: Perfect for the style. The lower carbonation gives the beer a creamy feel and its not overly viscous. 851 charactersDarbyOGill, Jun 03, 2010

As the aroma of bourbon fills the room while pouring it you know that something great is about to happen. Closer inspection reveals one of the best smelling beers I've ever experienced. Vanilla, espresso bean, milky sweet and bitter chocolate, a whiff of alcohol. It smells a lot like an empty bourbon barrel. 
It has an oaky bourbon flavor that intertwines with molasses, roasty coffee beans, and milk chocolate. But it's in the aftertaste that it really shines. The fade goes on and on with burnt cookies and espresso. Delicious finish. 
The mouthfeel reminds me a bit of 2% milk, very smooth. It's not too high on my drinkablility scale, due to the richness and alcohol presence. It's a splitter and a sipper that demands respect, control, and attention. Deservedly so. In my top 5 without questions. Why did I not by more of this when I had the chance? Why? 969 charactersbrownbeer, Jun 02, 2010
4.44/5  rDev -3.1%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured from a 22oz. bottle acquired in a trade with AleWatcher (Thanks!) into my Brooklyn snifter at cellar temperature (05/15/10).
A: Pours a deep, rich, motor oil black with an ever so slight ruby hue caped off with a tan head that quickly dissipates. 
S: Strong yet delicious bourbon scent along with molasses, roasted malt, and toffee/caramel. This incredible aroma is enhanced with a wonderful layer of coffee that is sweet, bitter and rich.
T: Intense bourbon flavor with very apparent alcohol heat, but in a pleasing way as long as you are a bourbon fan. Very complex flavors including molasses, roasted malt, caramel, toffee, bitter dark chocolate, sweet cocoa, vanilla, and milk chocolate all surrounded in a blanket of wood. I must say the coffee adds a very unique and flavorful quality, but I may prefer the original just a bit more.
M: Fulerl-bodied and oily with low carbonation. Perhaps just a bit thinner than I would like.
D: For the style this is certainly drinkable, but don't lie to yourself.
Overall this is certainly a great twist on the original classic. Another fine stout from Goose Island. Highly Recommended. 1,141 charactersLunch, Jun 02, 2010

Poured into my Cigar City snifter a deep black with a 1 finger head of dark tan, tiny bubbles. Aroma is notes of sweet dark chocolate, cocoa, and bourbon. The first sip is a plethora of flavors; chocolate sweetness up front followed by a strong coffee flavor, a nip of bitterness, and ending with a long drawn out bourbon taste. The alcohol is pretty apparent in the end. Letting this one warm up a bit as it was in the fridge brings out some more flavors. Slight vanilla notes. For being so "young" I will be interested to see what these do with some age on them. 
Very full bodied mouthfeel.
An excellent example of an American Double/Imperial Stout. 711 characterskbutler1, Jun 02, 2010
2.37/5  rDev -48.3%look: 4 | smell: 2 | taste: 2.5 | feel: 2.5 |  overall: 2I truly was excited to try this beer. Anything that reaches the top 10 on BA is a must try. But this really is a massive disappointment. Choke the hype. This beer is almost more overly hyped than Patrick Rue's 18% bourbon RIS. The pour was expected. Gorgeous dark stout with tight mocha carbonation that disspated quickly. Best part about this beer for sure, however everything on was total crap. Aroma is straight bourbon. Nothing complex what so ever. At least bring some complexity into this. I thought this beer was brewed with top notch Intelligentsia Black Cat Espresso. Taste is of more bourbon with slight creme'd sugar and lactose. Can I get some toasty malt or some hops in this, please? Taking another whiff of this, I get cheap vanilla extract with more milk chocolate (hence the lactoce again). The body is rich and full without any stickyness. Finish is one dimensional with bourbon straight through. I hardly want another sip. Luckily I'm splitting this beer with a friend or else I'd drain pour at least half the bottle. I'd say if one is looking for a coffee infused RIS done the right way, search out the Mikkeller Beer Geek Weasel (BA'ed one if you can find it). 1,181 charactersTrueRates, Jun 01, 2010

S: An incredibly rich and robust nose. Tons of vanilla and coffee attack the sense. There is also quite a bit of chocolate, bourbon, and some more coffee for good measure.
T: The bourbon and barrel flavors come through more than I would have expected. Certainly plenty of vanilla and the coffee flavor is quite intense. A nice chocolatey and sweet finish.
M: As one might expect, this is a full bodied beer. The carbonation is low and smooth, giving the beer a very creamy mouthfeel.
D: There is a bit of heat that comes through (as there is with regular BCS), but it is covered up quite nicely by the vanilla and coffee. Still, this is one to drink with a few friends. 777 characterswomencantsail, Jun 01, 2010
4.67/5  rDev +2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Pours very dark and is black as a coal mine in the glass. One inch of mocha colored head that had very good retention. Thick coating of lacing recedes back into the liquid after each sip. The aroma is everything you hope for in a coffee infuses, barrel-aged stout. Each element is equally balanced. I smell whole bean, freshly roasted coffee, vanilla, bourbon, oak, chocolate, and alcohol. The flavor is almost equally awesome. It only falls short because of the alcohol heat. Coffee flavor that is almost the best I have had in a beer. The barrel-aging lends bourbon, vanilla, and woody notes. Still a substantial stout under all the other flavors and that is very important. Awesome thick, chewy, and creamy body. The best of Goose Island stouts is still evident in this beer. A great beer that I will need to find another bottle and age for awhile. A relatively good value as well, I could see several local breweries selling this for $10 more a bottle. 956 charactersmorimech, May 31, 2010
4.43/5  rDev -3.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 3.5Poured at a recent BA tasting thanks to Pawel. Pours a viscous black with minimal head. Nose is vanilla dominating with some coffee, the bourbon boozy elements are hard to find. Taste is vanilla, oak, espresso, some cocoa, honey, and a hint of bourbon. VERY smooth mouthfeel, one of the best ever. Up there with the best stouts I've ever had.
EDIT: Split a full bottle with fresh palate and updated the review. Moved up with smell and taste, a bit down with drinkability. 472 characterssquaremile, May 31, 2010
4.84/5  rDev +5.7%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Somehow, I got a bottle of this. I think there was only 1 case in my town!! A 22 oz. bottle of this. It says it is aged in bourbon barrels and expresso is added. I also see it is number 3 on the list and anticipate this drink highly.
I poured it an got about 3/4 inch of a dark tan head. That head left a ring of bubbles which is easily stirred up but not much lacing. It poured very black brown and the body is opaque. 
The nose is awesome. Boiled down coffee, whiskey, charred wood, roasted malt, caramel. This is a great beginning. This beer is one of the most appealing based on the smell I have ever had. 
Taste: Well, I took a tiny sip and WOW did the flavors explode. It is loaded with coffee, sweetness, roasted malt and some bourbon undertones. The finish is pretty bitter, not sure if it is hops or the expresso. 
The beer is very thick body and viscous. It actually tastes feels like it was boiled down or thickened, but that is part of the fine appeal of this classic brew. There is a nice little zip after you taste it. The flavors linger on the tongue for sometime. The alcohol does not overwhelm you. It is not up front but I am sure it will let me know as I drink this. This is definitely one of the best stouts I have had. This puts Goose Island on the map as one of the fine breweries of the world with this accomplishment. I can't say enough about this beer. Truly enjoyable with every sip, I mean small sip. 1,431 charactersdaledeee, May 31, 2010
5/5  rDev +9.2%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Truly a world-class brew. I can't think of any way to improve on this complex, flavorful, yet beautifully harmonized beer. I don't remember having a beer stout than this.
A: Pours nice and thick, although not in the motor oil realm. Black with deep amber highlights at the edges if held up to some light. Surprisingly, it pours with a good sized light brown head which never fully dissipated for me. 
S: Wonderfully balanced. Vanilla, deep chocolate malts, bourbon, and coffee all are present, though none are more prominent than any other. Great smelling beer.
T: The taste is as amazingly balanced as the smell. Considering how much is going on here, that's quite a feat. Rich coffee blends w/ malt and a nice vanilla flavor as well as subtle bourbon warming. I can taste each element at work, and each one is on point. Booze is hidden very well, making me want to keep drinking and drinking. Aftertaste is wonderfully reminiscent of coffee ice cream. I want more!
M: great, full, creamy texture. No metallic or off sensations to be found.
D: As drinkable as any 13% beer I've ever had. After drinking the first bottle (with a friend) we immediately ordered a second.

4.53/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 422oz. bottle poured into a large Brandy Snifter
It pours a pitch black with a surprisingly deep mocha head that dies quickly into a very tight ring of bubbles around the edges. Hefty legs with carbonation bubbles appear when swirled. Around the thinnest edges of the glass a transparent deep chestnut color can be seen.
Ah yes the rich smell of bourbon, much like it's sister beer. The bourbon is much more muted and tame than it's sister though. From reading previous reviews I expected to be blown away the a deep rich coffee aroma. I found a surprising lack of that here and was kind of disappointed in the lack of a strong coffee nose as has been suggested. 
This beer is intense. The coffee finally rears its big head in the taste and I'm loving it. The coffee and bourbon play nicely together with smooth synchronicity. The backend is where this beer shines though. I know this is the 2008 version of BCS but it was much smoother than 08 BCS at this point. The coffee just makes it rich, while the bourbon adds the sweetness to the beer. The aftertaste is great as well. It's almost like you are chewing the richest chocolate covered espresso beans in the world. I can't see how this beer could taste any better than it does right now. 
The mouthfeel is so silky smooth with just the right amount of warming alcohol burn considering how bourbon heavy this beer is. Carbonation is perfect; it is present in the taste and has a nice scrubbing effect but not overdone to be distracting. The drinkability is good considering the ABV and the richness but it is such a thick calorie ridden beer I don't think it can score higher than a 4. 1,642 charactersweatherdog, May 29, 2010
4.85/5  rDev +5.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 522oz bomber into a snifter, bottled 3/26/2010. I've been staring at this one in my fridge for a few weeks or more waiting for a time to try it. FYI to anyone who doesn't know, this beer was brewed in 2008 so it has some age on it already.
A: Pours black with a tiny bit of clear brown on the edges and a small dark brown head that fades quickly and leaves tiny bit of lacing. While it's not the best looking beer compared to a regular imperial stout, this is what a barrel aged stout looks like.
S: The first thing I could smell as I was pouring this was the coffee. Smells like an espresso with vanilla and oak added in. A bit of dark chocolate and molasses in the background as well. If the coffee wasn't so overpowering I would have given this a 5.
T: Wow! I thought this was just hyped up but it delivers tons of flavors like no other. Imagine taking the base flavors of BCS like vanilla, molasses, cocoa, and chared oak and adding in a shot of espresso and this is what this beer tastes like. The finish changes between the coffee, chocolate, and vanilla flavors as it fades on the tongue. I think the coffee actually brings out more chocolate flavor and balances the overpowering vanilla flavors that regular BCS has. 
M: The feel is thick, oily, and creamy. It coats the mouth with all those flavors and allows the finish to last for a while. It's slightly thinner than regular BCS but that's like buying 10W30 instead of 15W30.
D: The ABV is damn high and it's going to take me a while to finish this bomber but I won't have any trouble. 
I hope they make this on an occasional basis as this is a damn good beer. I had a sinking feeling I would not like this since I didn't particularly like KBS but this takes what KBS is about and melds it with BCS to make a beautiful beverage. Highly recommended! 1,814 charactersGregSVT, May 29, 2010
4.57/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Bought this at the Goose Island Wrigleyville Brewpub yesterday, May 27th.
Before I review, let me state that the regular BCS is my absolute favorite beer in the world. 
It pours a thick jet black into the goblet provided, with a nice peanut butter tan head.
The expresso hits your nose right away! Smells of dark chocolate, bourbon and fresh roasted coffee fill the air. 
Intial taste is the dark roasted chocolate, with a smack of coffee on the back end. Dark candied fruits slowly mix their way in there.Also notes of tobacco. 
A bit boozier then the standard BCS. Definetely more bitterness also. I was glad that the metallic flavor you tend to get in some IMPY stouts wasn't present in BCCS. Creamy and full, this baby forces you to drink slowly and enjoy every sip. 
This beer is a palate killer. The blend of flavors and alchohol severly limit your ability to drink more than one of these, as I struggled with finishing my bomber. 
My only regret, is not getting another to take with, so I can try with a cigar. A simply amazing beer,that is worth the hype. For me though, I think I prefer the regular BCS. I'm not a a huge coffee drinker, but that didn't negatively affect my opinion. Just a great brew that I would purchase frequently if it was available. 1,270 charactersJToad, May 28, 2010

A: Pours deep dark black with an average mocha colored head. Lite retention and no lace.

T: Booze right from the start in the flavor as well. The coffee is there in a big way with mild vanilla and coconut flavors. Mild chocolate notes with a touch of dark fruit.
M: On the fuller side of medium, rich, boozy.
D: Not real drinkable. This one needs to be laid down for a bit. My only fear is that the coffee will fall out a bit. I will take my chances though as this one is way too boozy as is. 601 characterstpd975, May 28, 2010

A fantastic smelling beer which gives way to rich coffee and chocolate, with more of a sweet rum character than bourbon. 
A savory, complex beer with rich chocolate and coffee flavors. Butterscotch and vanilla also contribute.
A big beer. Carbonation is not extremely high but balanced due to bourbon aging.

A celebratory beer upon receiving my passing results for the CPA Exam. DONE FOREVER! I was saving another beer for this occasion, but I'm feeling a little under the weather so it will have to wait until next week (though it will still be my official celebratory beer). A generous extra received in a trade with Masterski, Thanks Alex!
2010 batch, bottled date 03/26/2125. Perhaps they meant 2010. Poured into a snifter. The beer appears black, absorbing all frequencies of light in the visible spectrum, and glugs out with great viscosity to feed a frothy two finger Sepia head.
The nose is of espresso, moderately roasted malt, sweet brown sugar, caramel, vanilla, and a strong bourbon presence. Chocolate is evident, and I get a little dark toffee with the brown sugar as the beer warms. The chocolate character reminds me of fudge. This is not unlike Barrel Aged Speedway or Parabola.
The flavor opens with a blend of dark chocolate fudge, coffee, roasted malt, and bourbon. Sweetness kicks in midpalate with the arrival of brown sugar and caramel. Bourbon is prominent throughout. The beer is boozy, but more like 9% than 13%. The sweet finish shows a blend of caramel and toffee added to the chocolate bourbon coffee. The beer is full bodied with a thick and chewy mouthfeel and an upper low level of carbonation.
A decadent and delicious titan that is well deserving of the hype. 1,400 charactersHopHead84, May 28, 2010
5/5  rDev +9.2%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured from a 22oz bottle into a tulip.
A - Pours a slick jet black with just under a finger of mocha foam that dissipates to a crema-like lace.
S - Rich aromas of both espresso and oak. Everything just melds together, and despite the high level of alcohol, there's no booziness present in the nose - just a mellow bourbon signature. Notes of vanilla, chocolate, toasted marshmallow, molasses, and dark fruit. Absolutely perfect.
T - The first sips fill the mouth with flavors of roasted barley and coffee with an added prickle of alcoholic heat. As the beer builds on the palate, chocolate and vanilla make an entrance, along with molasses and licorice. There's an understated sweetness that cuts through the bit of acrid char. Hop bitterness is assertive, but certainly not the focus here. A little aging could take the edge off the bourbon flavor if desired, but the beer is fine as is.
M - Rich, full, and silky body with an added bourbon tingle.
D - Simply outstanding, and completely deserving of all the hype received. 1,030 characterstrbergman, May 28, 2010
4.82/5  rDev +5.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.522 oz bottle into a snifter. 2010 Edition. 
Pours a dense black in the glass (but looks like a much murkier brown coming out of the bottle), topped with a thick finger of foamy burnt mocha colored head, which is rocking that angry reddish hue to it that you normally find in the most bad of the bad ass Stouts out there. This retains with some robust bunching around the edges, throwing a rich cascade of spotty froth and sticky brown oils all along the sides of the glass. The aroma is large and in CHARGE but still smooth as silk in the nose for the most part. The bourbon is strong, with a warming burnt mix of molasses and char character being present, but it is cut somewhat by the surprising aggressiveness (considering this has already been aged quite a bit) of that Black Cat Espresso. Vanilla and chocolate roast is sticky and thick behind the bourbon and coffee, adding some needed ease to this, as there is some sharp warmth from both the barrel and ABV but it fortunately never becomes overbearing at any point. 
The taste is dark and rich on the palate, with a thick sweet base of chocolate, toffee, and vanilla, which is then punctuated by that lush roasted coffee character and some earthy and herbal feeling hops in the rear of the profile. The bourbon comes out across the back, with a flush of sticky and burnt warmth that has a touch of wood on the edges of it. The finish is fairly intense, with a good bit of boozy heat and parching tannic dryness making sure that you aren't going to forget each sip anytime soon. The mouthfeel feels just beyond full bodied at times, with a thick and chewy presence that blows up in the mouth after each sip. Fortunately, there's a certain amount of slickness and creaminess to the body that keeps this moving surprisingly well, despite the immense size and boozy feel from the barrel that is at work here. Much like the regular BCS, the bourbon adds most of the heat to the flavor and feel. Luckily, not so much from the ABV, which is pretty impressive for a beer of this magnitude. 
Could this be the ultimate dessert beer? You've got yourself some chocolate soufflé, a shot of espresso, and a little nip of bourbon all rolled into one. The only thing missing is a fine Montecristo to puff on afterwards. My only issue with this, and it's the same one I have with the regular BCS, is that the bourbon is still a little to hot right now but put a little age on this sucker and it's going to be sublime in a couple of years. This is just the definition of a decadent beer. 2,532 charactersKegatron, May 27, 2010
4.52/5  rDev -1.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Thanks to phyfe99 for a great trade. This beer pours an oily dark brown with tan head. Carbonation bubbles are fairly large. Reminds me a bit of Dark Horse Plead the Fifth, in appearance. Smell is an intoxicating blend of coffee, chocolate, bourbon, and vanilla. Flavor follows. Fairly sweet, and quite bitter from the coffee. I also get burnt notes from the coffee. Unlike some other reviewers, I think the amount of coffee is just right (though admittedly I'm not a big fan of most coffee flavored beers), if not excessive. 
Body is fairly thick, but seems a hair lighter than regular BCS. Overall, a delicious drinkable stout. I cracked this open on a full stomach on a day where the high temp exceeded 80 degrees. And I'll have no difficulty working through my glass. 772 characterswaltonc, May 27, 2010
4.79/5  rDev +4.6%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Woohoo! Top 3 tick!
Pouring a very dark brown, black almost, this beer has dark brown highlights and a dense, dark brown head that recedes rapidly to a wispy disk. Could it look better? Yeah. Smell better? Arguably not. For a big, chewy imperial stout, this is about as good as it gets. Just exquisite, the blend of chocolate, coffee, bourbon and vanilla is terrific. Boozy too, this beer has caramel, fudge, and a fantastic sweetness. People have criticized this for not having enough coffee, but frankly, who needs another Planet Bean? The coffee character is quite exceptional, rich and full, making me think of another favorite of mine, Devil Over a Barrel
Opening with a juggernaut of flavor, there's caramel, chocolate, fudge, vanilla, bourbon and coffee, all carried through on a warming, boozy backbone. This beer is exceptionally well-balanced, more so than the regular BCS. Milk chocolate and vanilla lay a good base upon which the coffee expresses itself in a rather mellow way, with just enough bitterness to balance the sweetness. Chewy,this beer is medium-full in body with a moderate level of carbonation. Hot on the finish, this beer leaves a blend of chocolate, coffee and vanilla on the palate. Another notch in this beer's bedpost (or my liver, as the case happens to be), is the subtle inclusion of tannins to further help balance the sweetness. Drinkability? Well, it's 80F+ in my apartment and I just drank a Kolsch, and there's hardly anything else I'd rather drink right now. 
Regular BCS was one of my first OMFG beer, and the coffee variant builds on a phenomenal base. Favorable comparisons to BA Speedway are in order, with the beautiful chocolate, coffee and bourbon character just outstanding. A little oxidation should do this wonders, I can see this turning into something like the 03 BA Speedway with time.
**Edit 11 Feb 2012**
Thanks to Larry at Chevy Chase, I managed to get a bottle of the 2011 vintage. Thanks, Larry! Split with my dad 6 hours after I picked it up.
The coffee is a lot more prominent than I remember the first batch being. That said, it's a beautiful, beautiful coffee note. Rich, creamy, sweet, chocolate fudge with a rather brash bourbon and vanilla character. The booze is ridiculously well hidden. Plenty of caramel, brown sugar and some roast (maybe not enough?). The only flaw is that the carbonation is a little higher than I'd like, but letting it breathe solves that. Outstanding stuff. 5/4.5/4.5
**Edit 22 March 2014**
My last bottle of the 2010 vintage. Bottled March 26 2010, this is almost 4 years old.
All of the coffee's faded except for a fruity, creamy coffee character, but the base beer is present in all its glory. Moderate booze, vanilla, coconut, caramel, bourbon all along with a lot of roast and some Amaretto. Dessert-like, this beer is full in body, sweet, boozy, creamy, mildly coffee like, buckwheat honey.

First thing that comes to mind is chocolate covered espresso beans. It smells like chocolate, bourbon, vanilla, maybe some maple syrup/molasses, and coffee.
Upon first sip, I am getting some malty sweetness. Then I get a big bourbon kick, some chocolate, coffee, and vanilla. The coffee is really well integrated in this beer. I have had many beers that are just overpowering with that acrid coffee aftertaste. This beer does not have that. I get a bourbon and alcohol kick at the end of each sip. I wish the bourbon flavor was a bit more subtle.
Low carbonation. Appropriate for the style. Maybe a little oily, creamy. Nicely done. No complaints.
This is a heavy, dense powerful libation. In my opinion, the drinkability is hurt a bit by the strong boozy aftertaste. On the other hand, I really like the fact that the coffee is nicely balanced. I have had way to many beers that are just coffee bombs. 970 charactersDubber55, May 27, 2010
4.8/5  rDev +4.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5I had this at the brewpub on my trip to Chicago. Pours a jet black with a very thin layer of brown head. Head does not go away at all and there is tons of lacing down the glass.
Smell first is of coffee, while the vanilla and bourbon start to come through after. Lots of roasted malt too in the smell. The taste really integrates the coffee into the flavour of the stout. While I'm a huge coffee geek and can sometimes appreciate overpowering coffee flavour, this is still amazing even though it doesn't. Lots of vanilla and bourbon, with some chocolate.
Very smooth mouthfeel, though not overly creamy like some stouts. I actually didn't know what abv this was until part way into drinking it and saw it was 13%. It doesn't seem boozy at all, so I was a little bit surprised. I was easily able to finish off the bomber of this and I was a bit dissapointed to learn it was the last bottle at the brewpub at that time. I'm glad I went back two days later to get (yet again) the last bottle, but this time I took it home with me to enjoy later. 1,044 characterskwjd, May 26, 2010
3.43/5  rDev -25.1%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3Pours semi-thick with light foam only. Dark brown color, you can almost see through it as it is mostly clear, it also has a bit of reddish hue along the edges. Aroma has a moderate intensity, only faint coffee smell with bourbon dominating. 
Taste is again heavy on the bourbon with a good deal of sweetness. Where is the coffee accent? It's quite one dimensional with only a slightly bitter balance at the back. The nice thing here is that the alcohol seems pretty mellow for 13%. Mouthfeel is a bit thin for stout, but with barrel aging and high ABV it's appropriate. Carbonation was average. 
Overall I was not impressed. I was expecting more of a coffee flavor like an Abyss or Breakfast Stout but it was just not there. This thing is pure bourbon, and the only saving grace was that the alcohol was kept in check and didn't also affect the drinkability. It was just too sweet without enough complexity. I believe aging would help this beer some, but overall I don't think it will ever live up to the hype. 1,012 charactersbennetj17, May 26, 2010

Taste us spot on to the nose. Original BCS with just a wonderful dose of coffee. I was worried this would have too much coffee but its just the right amount to compliment the dark, sweet notes of BCS. Dense and rich, it coats the tongue. Not 'drinkability' but, 'sipability' earns it as close to a 5 as I can get. 479 characterskirok1999, May 25, 2010

A- Dark brown, nearly black body with some red hues shining through. Pours with a dark brown foamy head that fades somewhat quickly to a thick collar. No lacing left behind.
S- Lots of bourbon with vanilla, toffee, caramel, and some roasted malt.
T- Overall impression of the flavor is very sweet and slightly boozy. Flavor is a lot like the nose. Roasted chocolate, caramel, vanilla, toffee-pretty consistent throughout although the finish is pretty hot and astringent with a big alcohol heat.
M- Soft carbonation with a thick, syrupy body. Very smooth
D- This is an awesome well put together, well balanced stout. Its still a bit too hot-but it will probably be unstoppable with 1 yr on it. 736 charactersPittBeerGirl, May 24, 2010

Smells of caramel, bourbon, espresso and vanilla. The coffee and bourbon blend well - neither is especially distinct. Smells exceptional.
Taste oscilates between coffee and bourbon - this is the coolest part of the beer. Other things picked up were bittersweet chocolate, cayenne and vanilla. The espresso is very good. Very sweet, but goes well with the overall profile. It almost tastes like liquid tiramisu.
Mouthfeel is excellent, for 13% abv there is not much of a burn. Just lots of rich flavors
Drinkability is appropriate for what GI was going for, which appears to be decadence of Wagnerian proportions. They succeeded. But it's a little disappointing when something tastes really good and you can barely finish your half of a bomber. 770 characters, May 24, 2010

A: Black with very little head. The head that is there is dark brown and laces around the edge of the glass. 
S: A lot of vanilla/bourbon, roasted malt, coffee and hints of raisons. There is also some chocolate and oak in there. Smells great.
T: Nothing is really overpowering anything, there are tons of things going on and they all seem to complement each other. To me the bourbon is the first thing that i taste, it comes with a nice touch of vanilla. Next is some dark fruits followed by a milky chocolate. The end to me is a kind of oaky finish with the coffee coming in at the very end and lingering. There are hints of a creamy espresso throughout, but again, it does well to complement everything and not overpower. 
M: Fairly thick bodied but not quite like Dark Lord or anything. Creamy, with moderate carbonation.
D: Hides the high ABV fairly well.
 This is right up there with ORF, KBS, Abyss and other barrel aged stouts I've had. I need to have one big ass bourbon barrel stout tasting to see which is really my favorite. 1,215 charactersBS68280, May 24, 2010

Big thick spent engine oil black with a moderate sized, fast fading tan head. Some sticky and patchy lacing clings to the glass.
A strong alcoholic smell rises at first pour. Smells of dark coffee, chocolate, bourbon, piney hops and camphor remain potent throughout.
Wow! A taste of Kalua and bourbon jump straight out. Coffee, dark chocolate, malt and edgy hop bitterness follow.
The alcoholic kick is unmistakable.

4.76/5  rDev +3.9%look: 3 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured from a 22oz. bomber marked with a 3/26/10 bottled on date into a snifter and shared with schen9303. Before I get started, I want to say, besides the overall appearance, I'm really not sure how this could possibly be better than it already is...
A: Moderate pour yields a 1 finger coarse, coffee head that dissipates rather quickly. Beer is pitch black and thick like used motor oil. Lacing is near non-existent, with spottiness here and there and near no cling. 
S: Chocolate, brownie, licquorice, prunes, and sweet soy sauce all surrounded by overtones of rich, milky coffee. Nose is very robust overall and very potent. I can smell it as soon as the bottle pops open. 
T: Chocolate, brownie, slight liquorice, sweet soy sauce, and prunes in the background. This is very similar to the regular bourbon stout except for the fact that the coffee added gives it a layer of richness that adds immeasurable balance. Incredibly complex, this one gets a bit boozier as it warms. Finish is sweet and loaded with dark fruit. Aftertaste is one of chocolate and covered in the background by rich coffee. 
M: Medium to full bodied, slightly carbonated, and very very smooth yet lively enough to separate the flavors. Silky in the mouth with a slightly messy but pleasant finish. Aftertaste lingers but adds layers to the next sip. 
D: Like I said before, I'm not sure how this beer could possibly be better. This proves that limited availability does not = better flavor. I could have this again and again and not be tired of it and in fact, can't wait to see what a couple of months will do to this. Immensely smooth and complex, this is the best of the best. Seek it out, it won't dissapoint. 1,695 charactersSpeedwayJim, May 24, 2010

Appearance: Pours dark as night with a 1 finger light brown crown that shows moderate retention and lace which is to be expected with a 13% abv brew. 
Smell: Loads of chocolate, dark roast malt, coffee, vanilla, and bourbon.
Taste: Same as nose. Coffee up front, followed by roast malt and chocolate malt, then bourbon and a slight vanilla note. Hint of heat in the finish.
Mouthfeel: Heavy body with moderate carbonation. Syrupy and hefty but not cloying.
Drinkability: Pretty good despite the high abv and strong flavors. 588 characterskoopa, May 23, 2010

Pours black black with black edging, and a light brown/tan foamy top. Head settled down to about a quarter inch crust, but surprisingly foamy, all things considered.
Smells like a fantastically melded concoction of espresso coffee, cappuchino coffee, roasted malt, bourbon-y vanilla, milk chocolate, and hints of ... oak? Wow. This is a fantastic smelling beer.
Tastes good, too. Incredible balance for this strong of a -bal aged brew. Except for the bourbon flavoring, essentially zero heat. The coffee isn't overpowering in the slightest, and it's surprisingly sweet coffee ... like a vanilla espresso, almost. The milk chocolate and roasted malt definitely take a backseat to the coffee, but again: the harmony is perfect. The vanilla .. I swear that's oak, which is super rare in a stout this strong ... and maybe a hint of licorice all add subtlety. 
Creamy mouthfeel, though perhaps not as thick as one might expect. It's a rich beer, but not overly palate wearying. 1,011 charactersOverlord, May 23, 2010

4.92/5  rDev +7.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Reviewed from notes at our tasting with Darkness. I think I can say that we all enjoyed this one.
A- Pitch black with a light tan/beige head. The retention is decent overall but good for a barrel-aged beer (from my experience). A fine cloud and ring float atop the beer leaving very sticky suds on the glass but not much lace (bbl-aged trend).
S- Oak and bourbon up front but not overbearing. Dark cocoa, roasted malt, caramel, vanilla and hints of alcohol. I was waiting for some coffee in the aroma and it finally came in big-time about half way through my glass. Awesome balance and strength.
T- One for the ages. Oak and bourbon take a laid back approach compared to something like KBS. Dark chocolate, roast malts, vanilla and some caramel as well. Then there is the espresso... The coffee flavor in this beer is very strong but still balanced with the other stuff. I was absolutely blown away by how well the coffee is integrated into this one. The cocoa, coffee and oak balance is immaculate. This reminds me of the first time I had Peche Mortel on-tap in Montreal.
MF- Fairly thick, oily body that is somewhat creamy as well. Low carbonation like that of many big stouts and barrel-aged beers, but of course it suits the flavors very well. A good warmth is left on the palate.
DB- The $13 bottle was more than worth it. If this beer was able to be mass produced I would probably get a case every month. An amazing balance of the popular barrel-aged stout flavors. I can dream of this being on-tap someday for me to try. 1,532 characterscbutova, May 22, 2010
3.78/5  rDev -17.5%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Pours dark black with no head retention. The smell is heavily bourbon laced with black cat expresso in the background. This isnt the smooth bourbon, it's the stinging kind that doesn't please the nostrils. The flavor is flush with the base beer; bourbon and more bourbon, roasty chocolate, and alcohol. 
The beer itself is less harsh from the addition of expresso, which compliments the beer instead of dominating it. Bourbon, chocolate covered cake comes up on the finish. The mouthfeel has light carbonation but isn't as thick or full enough to my liking. The alcohol is still too prevalent for me although this beer does taste good.
IMO, this beer didn't meet the hype. Maybe with some age the alcohol wouldn't rear its ugly head. 734 charactersjobcrackerbah, May 22, 2010

A: Perfectly pitch black with a tiny white mocha head that quickly fades to a small lace on the top of the brew. Good.
S: Sweet creamy bourbon upfront blended well with vanilla. Deep dark fruits blended with booziness and hints of coffee roastiness far on the backend. Good.
T: Sweet coffee liquor upfront blended creamy bourbon and awesome chocolate. Deep roasty fruit mixed with raisin in the middle and hints of cherry vanilla on the backend. Very good.
M: Very smooth feel. Very creamy with low carbonation. Good.
D: Goes down very easy despite the 13% ABV on this brew. Very good here.
All in all, I tell ya what, this is a very good brew. This, to me, does not deserve the #3 spot on the top 100 beer list. This to me is more of a #20 at best. Very good to try at least once, but slightly overratted in my opinion. 872 characterssteve8robin, May 22, 2010

Beer Hype!? Not Here! I received this beer from a trade, and didn't know much about it. I watched it climb on the top 100 for about 3-4 weeks before I even realized I had it sitting in my cellar. Needless to say I was excited to try it. I love the regular Bourbon County so this has to be better right?! Yep, it sure was. This was a true pleasure to drink. The mouth feel was on point, the taste were all distinct in their own. Strong Chocolate, Espresso, Bourbon, and hints of Vanilla. I would drink this beer again and buy this beer again.

S - smells a lot of chocolates and some sweet coffee. Nice nose, but not as strong as I would have liked. Can't wait to try this one...
T - the taste is of a lot of milk and fudgy chocolates. This is followed by some molasses and bourbon. The finish is of dark coffee (by Intelligentsia) and dark chocolates. These flavors blend together quite nicely, forming a beautiful bourbon coffee imperial stout. This is easily a 5 in taste.
M - smooth moutfeel with a little bit of carbonation. I would never guess that this is 13 percent abv. The body is just a tad thin, otherwise it would be perfect.
D - this is a solidly crafted imperial stout. The bourbon is more subtle than the regular bourbon county stout, making this more of a fudgy coffee stout. I had to split this with my family, but I wish I had more to take down. This is a different beast than the regular bourbon county. 938 charactersbirchstick, May 20, 2010
4.35/5  rDev -5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.522 oz bottle, bottled 3/26/10, shared a few ways. I'll expand this review once I get a bottle myself and a larger sample but I think I got a good idea of my opinion of this beer.
Pours into a snifter an extremely viscous, thick oily pitch black. Hard pour produces a light tan thin bubbly head that quickly fades to nothing and no lacing as expected for this style of beer. Aroma is primarily composed of cocoa and bourbon and not quite as much coffee as expected though that becomes stronger as the beer warms. Mouthfeel is near perfect as expected from experience with the original BCS. Extremely thick, chewy and smooth with light carbonation and an endlessly lasting finish. The flavor has a much strong bourbon presence than expected, but it is much smoother and balanced than a fresh bcs is and the coffee becomes more obvious as the beer warms and the longer you savor the taste on the palate. Flavor also gains vanilla and molasses like sweetness that lasts long through the finish. I was expecting much more of a coffee presence from this and from this sample I'm much more optimistic about aging this beer. Regardless, I like forward to revisiting a larger sample very soon once I get a bottle of my own. 1,215 charactersyourefragile, May 20, 2010
4.44/5  rDev -3.1%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Got a bottle of this in a trade, thanks to that trading partner. I really like the regular version of Bourbon County, and this was just awesome at our little tasting. There are a few things I wanted to comment on first before my review. This is not better than the Abyss. Aging this beer is going to be a good idea because it is really hot, and from my experience with regular Bourbon County, these beers will age well. What I am worried about with aging this beer is the great coffee flavor that is very likely to fade with time. Overall, this beer is fantastic and deserves the talk that its been receiving. 
The appearance is dark black, but it has thinner brown edges that are a result from the barrel aging. Night Stalker is one of the thickest beers I have ever seen, so knowing that I now assume the barrel thinned it out a bit. It produces a cocoa head that leaves very very fast, the bubbles cannot withstand the high ABV of this beer. 
The smell is absolutely amazing. Beautifully roasted coffee with lots of strong bourbon, roasted grains and a very slight chocolate backing. Exceptional, outstanding, perfection. 
The taste is amazing and the smells carry over their characters onto the palate. Bourbon is still the big character in this beer, but the coffee is fighting for the dominant flavor. Light hints of chocolate are just delicious, with the malted roast in the very back. Whats going to be really great about this beer is in another year the alcohol is going to push out the grain and now subtle flavors, to produce a chocolate tootsie roll bomb, and hopefully the coffee sticks around for a while. 
The mouthfeel is a bit hot, and since it is such a thick and vicious beer it is a sipper. Delicious and worth the wait.

Bottled 3/26/2010. The beer pours dark brown with a tan head. The aroma is ridiculously complex with notes of chocolate, soy sauce, oak, bourbon and coffee. The flavor is chocolate, coffee, toffee, a tad bit of soy sauce and some nice sweetness. Thick mouthfeel and low carbonation.

A: Yep, Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout is a double stout: black in the center, deep brown on the edges. The mocha head dies quickly leaving an oily swirl of fine bubbles.
S: Bourbon, roast, espresso, vanilla, bitter chocolate melded perfectly together with a big, fat ribbon of caramel down the middle. 
T: Follows smell very nicely. All those elements are present and play off and with one another. Gourmet candybar dipped in bourbon and espresso.
M: Smooth, full, somewhat oily but sticky.

Large capped bottle, poured into a snifter. 
Very dark brown, but not quite black, with a cocoa colored head, good size and retention, some lacing. 
Strong aroma flows out of the glass, with a massive amount of bourbon and espresso; it smells quite boozy, like and overdosed irish coffee. 
Other notes, generally overwhelmed by the espresso and bourbon include vanilla, and roasted malts. 
Full bodied, flavor is just as expected. Lots of espresso, loads of bourbon heat/booziness, with notes of roasted malts, rich chocolate and vanilla. 
Now for the comments; I had a better impression on my first try, but this is still good. Some people mentioned better than Dark Lord, but that to me is just wrong; not on my first impression, not on my second I thought it got even close. 
Now, I am not a big fan of Goose Island, but this is their best beer, and that Blck Cat Espresso must be really good, as this seems miles away from the original Bourbon County Stout. 
It does not seem ready, though, and like the Speedway Stout, I think has a lot of aging potential and should be excellent in 3 years. My opinion, of course. Dark Lord still reigns absolute in my book. 1,269 charactersbrdc, May 18, 2010

A: Pours deep brown going-on-black, with a tinge of amber around the edge of the glass when held up to the light. Even a straight pour produces almost no head which dissipates quickly and leaves no lacing.
S: Tons of roasted aromas. Except for the wood character I could almost be smelling fresh espresso. This beer lets you know what it's about immediately, I just wish the alcohol was a little less evident in the nose.
T: Chocolate, malt, leather, wood, alcohol, a bit of smoke, and a great espresso flavor in the finish. Flavors blend better after it warms up a bit. Also some astringency present, likely imparted by the coffee.
M: Thick, smooth, viscous, and creamy. Reminds me of drinking milk. No carbonation is noticeable.
D: One bomber was definitely my limit, and that was pushing it. Good to the last drop, but my tastebuds were burnt out by the end. 916 charactersFunkyMacGroovin, May 18, 2010

A: Pours an unassuming black, with a ring of brown head that gives the entire beer a brown tint. Totally still now, it looks as if it is liquid velvet.
S: Deep vanilla, rich well-rounded bourbon, smooth espresso, caramel. All very intense, but balancing off one another and mellowing out their rough edges. 
T: Coffee-bourbon truffle is what comes to mind with the first sip, as the two are layered so well. Vanilla from the oak adds another element. The intensity of each flavour is fantastic, and any one alone would probably be overwhelming--very well crafted.
M: Silky smooth, slick. Viscous doesn't come to mind, as the spirit element of it cleanses the palate. 
D: Intense, yet very balanced and drinkable. Goose Island's sense of balance without sacrificing intense, delicious flavours never ceases to amaze me. 853 charactersdarklordlager, May 18, 2010

A= Poured a jet black/brown with zero light penetration. The chocolate tan head was gorgeous and rose just about 1/2" before settling fast. A few spots of lace but not much.
S= Lots of coffee and lots of bourbon overlayed rich caramel, chocolate, and toffee malt aromas. Some vanilla / wood barrel in there too. Alchohol was significant but not unpleasant.
T= One of the more diverse tapestries of flavor I have yet to experience. Big and rich flavors of roasted malt, chocolate, toffee, caramel, coffee, vanilla, oak, and bourbon whiskey. The bitterness of the coffee and the dryness of the oaky barrel played nicely with the sweetness of the malt and bourbon. Finished boozy but in a good way, leaving a wake of lingering flavors that were sensational. 
MF= Heavy body with a carbonation that struggled to lift this heavy, delicious beer. Felt almost creamy, certainly viscous.
D= I found the drinkability of this to be even higher than regular BCS. An all around success and a beer that I will happily drink more of. 1,162 charactersspointon, May 18, 2010

T: This beer is crisp and forward. Good, solid carbonation and bite. The coffee and bourbon flavors are doing a delicate dance and seem to cooperate together fairly well, adding to the beer's intrigue and complexity.
M: This beer tastes a bit young. High alcohol is very present, though the beer itself is quite tasty, so this can be overlooked to some degree.
D: This beer is very good, but right now I believe it is over-hyped and being over-rated. Tasty stuff, but certainly not top 10 in the world. 731 charactersHuhzubendah, May 18, 2010

Alcohol slickness on the side of the glass. Aroma is a dense conglomeration of vibrant, fresh brewed espresso, vanilla, bourbon, deep chocolate and woody accents. Quite intoxicating honestly.
First sip brings dense, semisweet dark malts bathing in deep roasted coffee flavors. Vanilla, chocolate and wood tannins intertwine along with a healthy kick of bourbon that packs a bit of a punch. Well balanced between sweet and bitter. A damn good, bold coffee bourbon stout that doesn't hold back! 
Mouthfeel is dense, rich and heavy. A big, bold brew all around that will warm the stomach for sure. A great twist on the already amazing Bourbon County. I have to give big kudos to Intelligentsia as their Black Cat Espresso is awesome and really helps to make this brew what it is!

I was lucky enough to get a bottle of this, even though Ohio laws didn't allow it to be sold in our state. So, I had to mail order and pay a slight premium. But I had to give this one a proper rating after tasting it a few times @ DLD 2010.
22oz bomber (love the red label) at slightly under cellar temp (around 52 degrees) into my Founders snifter. This black stout is completely opaque as expected. The head is a dark tan, almost brown, and is HUGE out of the bottle. Finally settles down to film and a ring. This beer looks great, a perfect looking stout and up there with the most picturesque beers I've ever had infront of me. My snifter is happy and so am I, now let's raise the glass!
Smell of coffee is the first thing that meets my olefactory. A nice rich roasted dark coffee that is fresh, not stale like so many other coffee stouts. Intelligensia makes some great beans and they seem to have been expertly added to this beer. There's also a healthy dose of bourbon and chocolate/vanilla. The only flaw is something that's built into the BCS base, and that's the "tootsie-roll" smell that instantly identifies this beer as a BCS variant. Not a fan of this - it's just an off smell to me. Other than that, this is close to perfect.
Woah! Great God!! This is a mighty fine beer!!! Tons of coffee that gives a great lingering taste (not too bitter as it coats my mouth after a sip). Bourbon presence is great, still a touch hot depending on where it hits in my mouth but not terribly noticable alcohol - a huge improvement from the regular BCS. Milk chocolate, rich and delicious. Not too much in the way of wood or vanilla, but this is afantastic beer and worthy of a "5" for taste.
Mouth is a touch thin. Good but thin IMO compared to the best feeling American Double/Imperial stouts.
Overall, this is a touch too hot to be called exceptionally drinkable. An elite beer but not the best in the world. I like KBS more because of it's chocolate and vanilla tastes - no "tootsie roll". The raspberry version @ DLD was better because it took the focus off that element as the sweet part of the beer. And, while this is great compared to the regulare BCS, wait until vanilla hits bottles.
A great beer to celebrate 300 ratings with! Here's to the next 300 and thanks to all the great traders I've been lucky to swap with! Cheers :) 2,356 charactersjampics2, May 17, 2010

Viscous pitch black body, it looks almost oily when swirled, leaving caramel-colored legs clinging to the glass. It's topped by a small dark brown cap which quickly recedes to a thin collar.
The medley of coffee beans, chocolate malt and bourbon on the nose is incredible. There are undertones of vanilla, malt balls, milk chocolate and the faintest hint of teriyaki sauce.
Upon first sip the viscosity is immediately noticed, and then flavors of milk chocolate, coffee beans, and a perfectly balanced medley of vanilla, caramel and tannins from the bourbon barrel. The coffee character is restrained, plainly noticeable but at a moderate level that adds depth without overwhelming the base beer. Alcohol becomes apparent in the mid-palate, at a harmonious level with the rest of the flavors, lending a sharpness that balances the initial sweetness. Chewy, almost syrupy from front to back with a long finish of coffee, caramel and warming bourbon. This is outstanding, one of the most memorable beers I've had this year. 1,080 characterslargadeer, May 17, 2010

2010 Edition bottled on 03/26/10
Appearance- Pours a bitch ass black with a nice one finger dark tan head that quickly fizzles away leaving a thin cap and collar. Not really any lacing is left but the collar seems to stick around.
Smell- Oh my word. SO much coffee bursting out of this one with an espresso like potency that I absolutely adore. Toffee and brown sugar along with the undertones of the good ol' Bourbon County Stout. Bourbon and oak abound with hints of vanilla and chocolate. The coffee really changes the nose quite a bit and actually improves it. A few whiffs of alcohol shows as well.
Taste- Not as much coffee as I remember or the nose leads on. The backbone of the beer is fully the Bourbon County Stout and the coffee is just a bonus (unlike the nose where the coffee is fully in charge). So much oak and bourbon as there is a lightly boozy alcohol bite that is a staple in fresh BCS. It gets much better after a year though. Loads of caramel through the vanilla and milk chocolate and just slightly sweeter than I remember BCS ever being. Vanilla galore as it may actually be more potent than the coffee. The finish is slightly warm but a delicious caramelly oakiness lingers.
Mouthfeel- Thick and rich and creamy with a body that may be about as thick and luscious as I can remember in a beer. The carbonation is fairly low, but spot on.
Drinkability- Really really love this one. Honestly it was a bit of a disappointment from what I remember at Dark Lord Day, but about the lamest disappointment ever because the beer is still REALLY delicious. The coffee doesn't seem quite as potent and realistically in a year when BCS really gets good the coffee will probably be all but an afterthought. Better than regular BCS? Yes. Could it use more coffee? YES!! Seek this out though, very good beer. 2,033 charactersyounger35, May 17, 2010
4.87/5  rDev +6.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Review number 900 for me here on BA. 22 oz bottle, 13% abv. Bottled on 3/26/10. Pours black as night, no highlights at all. Tan foamy head holds together for a minute, then trickles to a thin collar, leaving no spots of lace at all. 
What a nose on this beast! Roasty malt, espresso, oak, bourbon, vanilla, booze. Dark and milk chocolate. A faint hint of dark fruit. 
Roasted malt and dark chocolate up front. A great bourbon note, without being overwhelming. Oak, and a subtle vanilla flavor which blends well. Espresso flavor adds another complexity, and again melds perfectly with everything. A good boozy fade, without being overly hot. 
Great full body, carbonation is good. There is a slight creamy edge. Alcohol is present, but not overwhelming. Some sweetness, but it too seems to be the right amount. Yes, this is a little young, but feels top notch to me. I can't imagine how wonderful this beer will be in a year or two. Fantastic. 945 charactersBierguy5, May 17, 2010
4.03/5  rDev -12%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Beer poured into a tulip glass. Beer is black and dark, even at the corners and forms a brown head of medium and small bubbles. Not much lacing on the glass but for such a big beer that's not too surprising. Carbonation will remain a mystery. Disturbing the beer by swirl leaves some legs on the glass.
Aroma is so strong and complex. I pick up liquor and alcohol at first, kind of obvious and some chocolate and dark fruits as well. Coffee is in there but it wasn't the most dominant or noticeable flavor. I was expecting more coffee. 
Hmmm....beer is sweet and some of the bourbon edge from the regular version is missing here. Perhaps the addition of coffee some how mellowed the liquor character of the beer. Unfortunately, that's why I drink bourbon county, for the hot liquor flavor. There is some bitterness to this version, greater than the other, not as dry, coffee flavors in the back. I've had several vintages of the other BCS and on draft and I enjoyed the non-coffee more. A great experience to try this though for sure. Hopefully the wife will love it. 1,069 charactersdrabmuh, May 16, 2010

Why, it's Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout, of course! Bomber split 5 ways amongst myself, hopsleeroy (the lucky bastard, err...bachelor), JDV (the drunken, stripper-grabbing miscreant), and two other friends.
Pours a deep, dark seal-brown body with a thinning cola hue at the edges of the pint glass. No head, save for a wisp of short-lived, light tan foam that dissipates quickly to a ring of bubbles. The aroma is a blast of earthy, cold-steeped coffee beans, blended with Baker's chocolate and raw ethanol. Sharp, pungent, decadent, and boozy. The mouth says "Let's go!".
I oblige, and am happily met with an onslaught of roasted coffee, dark chocolate and darker fruits (fig, currant, raisin). Almost instantly, the barrel-aging lashes at the tongue with a boozy heat that screams of wooden tannins. The carbonation level is bit too high for my liking, and makes the body feel thinner than it should. Still, the medium-thickness glides effortlessly across the palate, and never becomes overly chewy or vinous. All in all, a great beer worthy of the BCS name. Thanks again to hopsleeroy for the share, and congrats on the wedding! 1,214 characterswagenvolks, May 16, 2010
4.97/5  rDev +8.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5So glad to get a crack at this one as I've drank a good amount of GI since it showed up in the Boston area. The pour is great and aroma is like sticking your nose in a bag of fresh ground coffee. The mouthfeel and drinkability are off the charts without the alcohol burn that I get from fresh BCS. A great beer to share a bomber with friends with and one I don't think needs to be punished to the cellar for a few years. Rivals the 2007 Abyss as the most complex beer I've laid lips on and no reason to doubt that this beer deserves the accolades that it has been receiving....unless you live in California:) 608 charactersNorica, May 16, 2010
4.77/5  rDev +4.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Wow. Pours like most imperial stouts, with a perfectly milk chocolate colored brown. The smell is amazing. Lots of bourbon, like regular BCS, and a big espresso character. Also chocolate, vanilla, caramel, and oakiness.
Amazing. Lots of sweetness all the way through, though most notably up front. Toffee and caramel fade into a perfect vanilla/coffee/bourbon mixed flavor that is simply overwhelming in its complexity. Very hot on the palate and going down. The aftertaste is of roast coffee and chocolate. This is only going to get better with age. 
Very heavy and silky smooth body makes for an incredible moutfeel. The only place I can mark it down is the drinkability, because of its sweetness and 13% ABV. It's not my favorite beer, or even my favorite imperial stout (Abyss enjoys that honor), but it's definitely top 10, and worthy of its world class ratings. 869 charactersjdklks, May 16, 2010

Bourbon - DUH, but neither steals the show. Once again this beer is about balance!

Not as good as nightstalker or the regular bourbon county. The bourbon and coffee flavors are both quite intense and they just don't mix as well as one would have hoped. With that being said this was still enjoyable as fuck. I just think the drinkability suffered.
This beer being #3 and Nightstalker being #98 on the best of BA is just stupid. Perhaps people give it a higher score because of its rarity? 563 characterskbnooshay, May 15, 2010
4.42/5  rDev -3.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4A= Really happy this made it to MN. The pour is classic RIS nice and thick looking in the pour with a nice black out black color. The head is a small dark brown color similar to the color of Hunahpu's head. Little retention and lacing.
S= Excellent Bourbon notes. Not as harsh smelling as the regular BCS. Nice wood smell in it. There is some underlying alcohol smell to it is buried directly by the coffee. Nice chocolaty aroma in it as well.
T= The taste is also very similar to the regular BCS only not as harsh either. The coffee makes itself more pronounced in the taste than the nose. Great bourbon and oak notes. Wonderful tastes that are much much more mellow than the regular BCS fresh. Is beer aged more than the regular?
M= Really thick and creamy. Deliciously smooth. Coating the entire mouth with a lasting finish.
D= Wonderful brew. The regualar BCS is one of my favorite stouts and this one is just as great. Very similar to the regular while being just a little different. I really look forward to the Vanilla version. This is world class but I can think of a few stouts I've liked more. 1,107 charactersjjanega08, May 15, 2010

Pours black, darkest of heads, with staying power, going to a thick collar and a tiny bubble film. Nose of sugary espresso, vanilla, and roasted malts. Big and chewy. More coffee grounds, huge notes of coffee, vanilla, brandy, and dark and sludgy goodness. World class Double Stout, tasty and delicious, what else can be said 390 charactersBillolick, May 15, 2010
4.87/5  rDev +6.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Pours a near total black, but decent brown hi-lights - dark brown moderate head. Nose is brilliant - deep notes of coffee, but also a sort of brown-sugariness and vanilla. Taste departs a bit from the nose in my opinion but is still fantastic. The roasty coffee is the major player here, but there's brilliant layers of vanilla and bourbon. This is much less hot than the start Bourbon County Stout...but still maintains a bit of a sting all the same. The bourbon and vanilla complement very nicely, and keeps the brew from being overly bitter from the roasted coffee notes. Excellent.
Mouthfeel is a bit thinner than I would like...it had a certain bubbly/stinging character to it. All in all, not a big deal - still fairly creamy and heavy.
Drinkability is superb. I could sip on this all night. 799 charactersMavajo, May 15, 2010
4.77/5  rDev +4.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4So happy to be able to review this beer! Had it in a bomber poured into a pint glass.
A - Jet black with very thin brown head.
S - Amazing smell. Notes of bourbon, coffee, vanilla, and chocolate. Smells delicious.
T - All of the above mentioned in smell. Slight hint of alcohol. It has an amazing taste. Little to no hops. The coffee balances the bourbon taste well.
M - Appropriate for the style. A little thick and creamy.
D - The alcohol content makes this beer a little difficult to drink much more than a bottle of. It is amazing and I wouldn't mind having more, but could be dangerous.
This is a quality beer. It is worthy of most of the hype and makes me excited to try the vanilla and rare versions rumored to be coming out in the future. 748 charactersscarnold8, May 14, 2010
4.87/5  rDev +6.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Serving Type: Bomber
Appearance: About as dark as I imagine it is possible for a beer to be. Very limited brown head. 
Smell: Exploding with (surprise) bourbon and coffee. Fainter aromas of alcohol, vanilla, and chocolate. 
Taste: Very much like the original BCS. Tons of flavor here. Bourbon, vanilla, coffee, roasted malts. Compared to the original, the coffee seems to step up and reign in the bourbon a bit. Also seems less boozy than the original. Alcohol presence is noticeable but not a bad thing. 
Mouthfeel: Thick and warm. 
Drinkability: I drank a 22oz bottle of this with no trouble. It did however pack quite a punch, so if there is any driving in your future after having this beer, split the bottle with a friend. 
I am a big fan of the original BCS, so I jumped on the chance to grab some of these. I am blown away by how good it is. Easily the best bourbon barrel aged beer I have had. Deserving of all the hype and high ratings. 951 charactersDaveonBA, May 13, 2010
4.49/5  rDev -2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4A - Dark black - no seeing through this at all. One and a half finger of tan head after the pour, but after a few minutes there is nothing left. It borders on watery, but the ABV explains this.
S - Very mellow, albeit intense bourbon. The coffee bitterness is there, but a lot more subtle than I expected. I like the blend. A big sniff does get a bit of sinus clearing alcohol, but I would have expected more. Very impressive
T&M - This beer has been aged. Even though it was bottled less than two months ago, it is definitely not hot and fresh. It reminds me of how the regular 2008 is drinking right now. However, the coffee bitterness finds a home here, and the result impressively makes it better than an already stellar original. Mouthfeel is plenty creamy and sticky. As in the nose, the balance between bourbon and coffee is perfect. I am curious, but I would guess this one doesn't need any additional age at all.
D - Ideally, a 22 oz bottle would be split about 5 ways. I can hardly hold that against this beer, but I can wish it was also bottled in 12 oz form so I could enjoy it more regularly. Oh well... 1,119 charactersdougofthefuture, May 13, 2010
5/5  rDev +9.2%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I think the other reviews do a fine job of it and I don't know that I could find the words to do this beer justice. Let's put it this way, last month I bottled my own coffee beer after it had aged on oak for awhile. I think it is the best beer I've ever brewed. It is swill compared to the BCBCS. I bought 8 bottles, 2 for a friend and 6 for myself. I drank one. I immediately waxed the remaining 5 to prevent myself for drinking them and I toyed with the idea of only giving my friend one bottle. 
Goose Island you have created a masterpiece!
A- Spent motor oil black with a thick creamy deep brown head.
S - The coffee and bourbon immediately jump out at you. Sweet and roasty with just a hint of vanilla punching its way through.
T - Wonderful! Starbucks has nothing on this coffee. Deep roasted dark coffee and warm sweet bourbon. Oaky and roasty.
M - Warming and coating. Creamy with a hard liqueur burn.
D - Like I said above I had to seal the remaining bottles so that I wasn't tempted to drink them. This is by no means a two or three bottles in a night beer. It is a sipping beer meant to be savored with a good friend and a good movie. 1,151 charactersMayorAdamWest, May 13, 2010
4.49/5  rDev -2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Thanks to GbVDave and lurchingbeast for hooking me up with bottles in recent trades.
Pours pitch black and completely opaque without even the slightest hint of lighter color when held to a light source. One finger dark mocha brown head that immediately fades into a thin ring. Not much in the way of lacing.
Deep roasted malt aroma with lots of silky dark chocolate, roasted coffee/espresso bean, alcohol heat and toffee. There's also a slight nut presence and this is all perfectly balanced by a nice bourbony, earthy oak character along with some slight vanilla. The chocolate, roasted dark malt is very prominent in the nose but the other notes provide a nice complexity that makes this beer smell amazing.
Chewy medium body with lots of silky dark chocolate malts, hot bourbon, deep roasted coffee/espresso bean, toffee and nut. Very roasty up front with a prominent roasted coffee/espresso flavor followed by the silky dark chocolate notes and a very prominent bourbon presence that lingers into a long sweet dry finish. The heat from the beer is mostly from the bourbon barrel and overall, at 13% the ABV is decently masked. The bourbon barrel also gives off a touch of vanilla that adds to the silky chocolate notes, balancing out the hot bourbon/alcohol and deep roasted coffee notes. Very well balanced and very tasty but this beer is just a bit too hot at this stage and will only improve with age. Recommended! 1,424 characterscorby112, May 13, 2010
4.8/5  rDev +4.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Well...as this one has jetted up the charts I figured I better find a bottle & try it. I need to let regular BCS rest for 2-3 years before it cools off enough for me, but it looks from reports that this one is ready to roll. Let's hope so!
Black. Tannish, quick-collapse, easy-store head. Smell delicious: almost exactly like a boutique store coffee-cake that some mischevious, tattooed employee bumped some Jack into. Nice. 
OK, so given the comparisons to KBS, I was waiting for disappointment, since it's the only barrel-aged Founders beer I don't worship like a false idol. This ain't KBS. It's much better. 
Don't know what this Intelligensia coffee is, but it does a mind-meld with the bourbon that's nothing short of brain-jarring. The two are in perfect harmony. The coffee is used with a pleasingly light touch, but is present enough to slash the palate-slamming bourbon of the base BCS. Heavy vanilla rushes in, & again there's a cake tinge to the taste. The barrel dries out the whole roll pleasantly, leaving my mouth watering as I eye my Darkness snifter after putting it down for a moment. 
I hate to join the stampede, but hell, this is a great beer. Harnessing the bourbon of the original, cutting it with just the right amount of evidently quality coffee, & doing who knows what else to it. Darn near perfect. I will seek out more of this, tomorrow. 1,370 charactersmaximum12, May 13, 2010

A: Pours pitch black with a thin yet incredibly creamy dark brown head. I was hoping for more retention and lace. Only a few specs left on the glass.
S: What can I say that hasn't already been said? Just plain unreal aromas of fresh ground espresso coupled with dark chocolate, molassas, cherry, and the perfect amount of bourbon.
T: See above. The espresso really cuts the thick bourbon flavor of regular BCS. All I can say is this is what all other barrel aged coffee stouts aspire to taste like.
M: Not hot, syrupy, or boozy in the least. Slick and sticky with a bit of bite from the espresso/hops/alcohol. Perfect.
D: I don't know what's in the water over on Fulton Street, but I hope Greg and his crew keep drinking it. This is, hands down, the best, most fully realized beer I've had in ages! 882 charactersGbVDave, May 12, 2010

Three of us split a bottle, poured well with some brown head that dissipated fairly quickly. Very dark, opaque beer. Didn't leave behind much lacing, but there was some kind of residue.
Smells great, mostly got the bourbon at first but the coffee was definitely there. Really great smell, a slight variation on the bourbon smell you would expect from a barrel aged beer.
Tastes amazing, wow. For sure my favorite barrel aged beer, definitely better than KBS in my mind (we had some right after to compare the two). The bourbon and the coffee are both there, but the flavors blend together much better than I had expected. We noted that as the beer warmed up the bourbon became more prevalent, coffee was barely noticeable at room temp. Mouthfeel maybe leaves a bit to be desired at first, but it gets better as the beer approaches room temperature (as does the taste). The alcohol also becomes more prevalent as it gets warmer but pleasantly so, I never found it hard to drink.
Amazing beer overall, not sure I would prefer it over some of the beers it's currently ranked above (it's #3 at the time of this review), but it's still awesome and I would love to have it again. 1,283 charactersAWolf, May 12, 2010

I looks super dark black, kind of like oil with some small brown bubbles on the top that faded away slowly. It smells pretty amazing, a bunch of coffee and chocolate, not as boozy as I would expect with the bourbon barrel stuff.
Tastes even better than it smells, nicely rich with some great but subtle coffee taste. Get the bourbon and vanilla influence in the barrel. Goes down like a smooth, syrupy, thick beer that coats the threat and leaves some stickiness in the throat. I destroyed the bomber so I guess that makes this a 5. Love this beer, want more of it. 677 charactersRodneyX, May 12, 2010

S: Coffee + BCS = Amazing. This is the smell of your dreams, maltiness with oaked vanilla and coffee.
T: Amazing, Wonderfulness, Near Perfection. The coffee mellowed and cut the taste even further, I really felt like this had been aged even though it was recently bottled. This reminded me of aged BCS more than newer BCS.
M: Smooth, Rich, Creamy
D: I could have opened every bottle I bought, This was the second leg of the relay with the Abyss, the morning after Hunuphus and it easily was the best of the three on my palate. The Abyss earned high marks and I expect it to improve with age but this stole the show at least for a night.

4.75/5  rDev +3.7%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Thanks to chefmikeanderson for the split. Poured from a 22oz bottle into a wine glass. Poured oh so dark and with a very dark head, about 2 fingers deep. The smell coming off of this beer is incredable! Roast malts, burbon, vanilla, and coffee dominated. It tastes just like it smells, and the burbon is better balanced by the coffee than the bcs. The combination of oaky/vanilla, burbon, coffee,with such a great stout is amazing. It's not too heavy in mouthfeel, but it sticks to your mouth and that great flavor lingers till the next sip. For 13% the alcohol is pretty well hidden even as it warmed to room temp, and with some more age this beer will be incredibly drinkable. Can't wait to get some more of this!! 716 charactersseniorcleaver, May 11, 2010
5/5  rDev +9.2%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Had from a bomber at Goose Island-Wrigleyville. Bottled on 3/26/10, sampled 5/10/10.
I love BCS. This beer encompasses all of the incredible things about BCS, but then adds a very nice coffee-espresso note to it. Pours the same thick oily black with milk chocolate head. 
Nose is incredible, the familiar vanilla, bourbon, oak, chocolate notes, but then it adds a very nice espresso aroma as well. It blends perfectly with everything else that's going on. I was afraid that the coffee would be overdone in this one, but definitely on the right track from here.
Taste is equally amazing, this is just unreal. Again, the familiar sweet vanilla, bourbon, oak, chocolate flavors, but sneaking in there is the espresso too. Delicious. I don't really believe in perfect beers, but there's nothing really wrong with this one. I love the aroma, I love the flavor, and, while robust, everything fits together very well.
Feel is very smooth and slick. Low carbonation, medium to full body. I never really thought of BCS as a "chewy" stout, and neither is this. For a robust, big ABV stout, however, the feel works on this. Very smooth.
Drinkability is tremendous. Beautiful beer to have, I didn't want it to end. I guess this is the best beer I've ever had.
To note, a friend of mine was having regular BCS on tap while I was drinking this. Comparatively, this is richer, smoother, and not nearly as hot as regular BCS.
If you like BCS, believe the hype on this one. 1,463 charactersLordAdmNelson, May 11, 2010
4.97/5  rDev +8.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Goose Island Bourbon County Stout is certainly in the top few beers I've ever tasted. It's the example I like to present to my wine snob friends to back up my side of the argument. And I definitely love coffee stouts. So why was I worried before I tried this beer? I think I was just afraid that nothing could taste as good as this beer sounds on paper. So, with a bit of trepidation, I poured it from the bomber into a tulip.
A: The beer pours a very dark brown. The head is fairly large for the style, tan, and a bit fizzy. It dissipates pretty quickly into a splotchy cap, and leaves lacing all down the glass.
S: Extremely strong. It's pretty similar to the regular BCS, with tremendous roasted malt, vanilla, bitter chocolate, and wonderful woody bourbon. The coffee isn't super strong, which is a good thing. It blends in with the other smells instead of overwhelming.
T/M: Like in the smell, the coffee plays an important but supporting role. I was afraid it would be BCS with some coffee thrown in there, but the coffee really tastes like it belongs with the chocolate, vanilla, malt and bourbon. Like it had always been made that way. For such a hot beer (and make no mistake, the bourbon is hot and loud), it's almost unbelievably balanced. The BCS is the same way, but the coffee adds yet another delicious layer to it. The mouthfeel is extremely thick and rich, with extreme coating. 
D/Overall: Absolutely outstanding. Takes everything that makes BCS a world class beer and improves on it. Listen to me: believe the hype. 1,538 charactersCharlatanSin, May 11, 2010
5/5  rDev +9.2%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I am a avid stout drinker and this stout is without a doubt one of the finest (if not the finest) stouts I have ever had. I read many reviews on this stout and was skeptical if it would really live up to the hype that I was reading about how good it really was,well it was ALL OF THAT hands down.
First the aroma was incredible,it has a wonderful coffee bean nose to it that is out of this world.
Second the color is so incredibly dark and rich it reminds me of a very light molasses syrup that as you swirl it around the glass it leaves a beautiful gold trail on the side of the snifter. 
Third the very first taste of this truly incredible stout is so well balanced with a rich coffee flavor, a slight hint of chocolate and amazing bourbon barrel flavor ( but not overwhelming bourbon taste ) for a 14% ABV stout you would NEVER know it was that high in content.
This is truly one of Goose Islands finest they have ever produced and am hope they continue with their fine crafting of these fine stouts for many years to come. 1,026 charactersgoodbeer4me, May 11, 2010
4.79/5  rDev +4.6%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Goose Island...very impressive. I have always enjoyed their Bourbon County Stout, and was excited when they announced their variations. I have been surprised that this beer has shot up the rankings as fast as it has. Picked up my first bottle in a trade with Brew33. Figured I'd better crack it open and see what all of the fuss is about. Split with my two favorite BAs and poured into my Portsmouth snifter.
Deep, dark, thick brown. Stacks up beautifully in the snifter, presenting a sandstone colored one-finger head. Although there is just a bit of shrapnel left on the glass, the head billows up every time I place the beer back on the table. About halfway through the beer the head had reduced to a wispy cap of tan.
Bourbon and Coffee...astonishing, given the name, no? Throughout the session, one would replace the other in terms of potency. At times, the beer seemed to be dominated by the coffee only to be pushed aside by the bourbon. A few times you could have told me I was drinking the BCS and I would have believed you; other times I could be convinced that I just pitted at the 93 Stop and Go for an espresso before work. Trace amounts of chocolate and sweet (vanilla), but certainly dominated by the obvious. Very, very impressive.
And the taste does not surprise. Hello Bourbon County Stout. It does taste similar to the BCS, but has the obvious coffee addition. We didn't even crack this thing open until it had been sitting out for nearly an hour, but as it continued to warm up, the bourbon continually gained ground on the coffee. By the final lap, the bourbon had taken the checkered flag. Not too hot, but definitely in your face. Perhaps hints of chocolate, but frankly, we were too impressed by what the coffee had added to an already impressive beer. The dark malts are obvious, but this beer builds its reputation on its name: Bourbon and Coffee. I was a bit disappointed by the mouthfeel at first, but again, as this guy warmed up, it became creamy, smooth, and velvety. Impressive all the way around.
We talked about the similarities to KBS (which I truly enjoy). Both impressive beers...so we cracked a 2010 KBS right afterward to check it out. After a valiant attempt at comparison, I would have a tough time crowning a victor. Regardless, Goose Island has raised the bar with the BCBCS. This is one fine beer...believe the hype.

4.55/5  rDev -0.7%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 422oz bottle with a best by date in just under 5 years. drank from an oversized snifter. the hype got to me. i was going to save these for a while since i only got a couple. 
A- this one pours out a black colored body with a small tan colored head that quickly becomes no more than a crown. more head than i was expecting from a beer this strong. solid rings of lacing are left behind. cant ask for anything else. 
S- the standard dark roasted malts that remind me im drinking a stout comes out first. after that comes a lot of dark chocolate, and bourbon. theres plenty of vanilla, evidence that this has done its time in the barrel. a little bit more milk chocolate, and of course, the strong blast of coffee at the end. perfect. im getting excited about this!
T- the taste starts out with dark roasted malts and quickly moves into sweet milk and dark chocolate. the bourbon comes through strong, and the vanilla from the barrel comes through alot more subtley. the espresso taste integrates itself so well that its hard to believe this wasnt the brewers initial intention. the alcohol is pretty well hidden.
M- thick and oily. palate coating. moderate warming from the alcohol, but at 13% what do you expect?
D- this is the current "it" beer. its not that limited, its sold in several states. this is a totally solid beer all the way around. give it a shot if you get the chance. theres a reason its climbed its way to the top so fast. it wont stay for long in the top 10 (currently 6), but itll have its place in the top 100 for some time. seek this one out. 1,566 charactersjwinship83, May 11, 2010
4.36/5  rDev -4.8%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Not a big BCS fan but I liked this one a lot. Black oily color with almost non-existent head. Aroma coffee and bourbon. Taste very nice combination of bourbon, coffee, caramel, vanilla, chocolate. Finish slightly bitter with alcohol apparent. Mouth feel silky and thick.
I liked this one enough to go back and buy the rest of what the store had. I am not a huge coffee stout fan but this was superior beer - reminded me of Dark Lord but just a notch below in taste and complexity. 481 charactersrandjuke, May 11, 2010
5/5  rDev +9.2%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I have never been compelled to write a review before, but this is my favorite beer of all time. It is perfection. The coffee flavors are huge and balance out the bourbon really well. I am not even that crazy about BCBS, but this is just amazing. I think it could benefit from some aging, but it certainly can be drunk right now. 328 charactersSleepyGrant, May 10, 2010
4.45/5  rDev -2.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Big thanks to Dan for sharing a bottle.
Pours extremely dark brown out of the bottle and sits black in the glass with only hints of mahogany showing through the edges. There's a small bubbly tan head that recedes very quickly to a small collar.
The aroma is massive though not extremely different than the normal BCS. There is plenty of vanilla, chocolate, roasted malts and, of course, bourbon. The espresso is present but it's not nearly strong enough to be the dominant aroma. Think BCS with a hint of coffee.
The taste is more of the same. It's got a sweet molasses and chocolate sweetness up front with some heavily roasted malts and bourbon and vanilla in the finish. The coffee comes out more as it warms up and shows up mostly in the finish.
The mouthfeel is completely decadent, nearly perfect - full bodied but with enough soft carbonation to keep things from getting too syrupy. Velvety.
As a coffee beer fanatic, this one doesn't exactly knock my socks off, but as a beer lover it's fantastic. I can't say that it's a major deviation from the base beer but, why mess with a good thing I suppose. 1,112 charactersgford217, May 10, 2010

Initial aromas of dark chocolate truffles, bourbon, vanilla and dark fruit, although rich coffee aromas become more prominent as it warms. Flavors of bourbon and oak, chocolate covered espresso beans. Nice creamy mouthfeel, with perfect carbonation and a lingering warming alcohol presence. An outstanding beer. 375 charactersemmasdad, May 10, 2010
4.79/5  rDev +4.6%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Finally, after all the hype, I get to try this for myself. Here goes...
A: pours super thick and black as night, like motor oil. very little light brown head that faded fast and no lacing on the glass
S: wow, smells intense. massive amounts of coffee, bourbon, chocolate, vanilla, oak, figs, dark fruits, raisins, dark roasted malts and intense espresso beans. yum
T: again, wow. very intense and complex. tastes similar to the nose. the bourbon hits first with a amazing blend of chocolate and coffee. roasted malts, dark fruit, dark chocolate, vanilla, oak, a touch of cherries. as it warms it becomes even more complex. so wonderful
M: feels heavy, thick, oily and chewy. warms the mouth and throat. carbonation is light to medium.
D: well, at 13% abv the alcohol is very noticeable but not nearly as intense as regular BCS. I love BCS but the coffee seems to mellow out the bourbon alcohol burn which is wonderful. 
One bomber is all that one needs on this bad boy. 
Overall, yes, this beer lived up to the hype. Simply amazingly and complex. Curious to see what time will do to this wonderful beer. I would highly recommend everyone try this if you can. 1,164 charactersCosmoHopHead, May 10, 2010
4.55/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5thanks to cheeze for this one.
A: Pitch black, thick motor oil. Large dark tan head. Solid retention, but only the spottiest of lacing. Very nice collar forms once the head settles.
S: Rich chocolate, caramel, espresso, oak, bourbon and vanilla. Not as much coffee as I was expecting, but the nose is complex and enjoyable.
T: Like the nose, not as much coffee as I was expecting, but delicious none the less. I wasn't a fan of the regular BCS, I found it too boozey and abrasive even with age... this was super smooth. It has all the good flavors of BCS plus some coffee all wrapped in a tight, well-crafted package. The bourbon is subtle and serves to accentuate the rich chocolate/caramel malt base.
M: Simply stunning. The weight of the body is ideal... in the medium range of full bodied. Smooth, even carbonation throughout. Nice, light bitterness in the finish.
D: I plowed through my 22oz bottle way too quickly for a 13.00% brew. Very pleased with this offering, I hope it makes a repeat appearance every year. Now lets see if I can sit on my other bottle for at least a year. Its going to be tough. 1,113 characterscallmemickey, May 10, 2010
4.44/5  rDev -3.1%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 422oz bomber, stocked up at Star on the day of release
Intelligentsia is easily the best coffee in Chicago, and amongst the best coffee i have consumed anywhere in the world. the absolute care put into every bag of beans is evident. the black cat espresso used in this brew is the same that can be found in Dark Lord
appearance: sharp red label, poured into large oversized snifter...pours a rather still ebony, light chocolate head but minimal lacing really
smell: definitely simlilar to the standard BCS - rich dark chocolate, really nice espresso, coconut, vanilla bean
taste: its certainly evident that BCS is the base beer here - the coffee provides a real nice twist. This beer is still palate-blasting, bitter dark malt with high bourbon notes. The coffee/espresso is nice - well roasted, but not really overpowering. What is overpowering is the strength of this one - much like BCS, i should have known a bomber would be a tough task. I like what they've done here, but i see this, BCS, and night stalker as all being on the same level
mouthfeel: sticky and syrupy, high bourbon presence, stinging bitterness, abv is a factor
drinkability: requires a liter of water to be consumed with it, otherwise the burn and sticky nature might overpower me 1,258 charactersdirtylou, May 09, 2010
4.59/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured completely black with no light penetrating, a light thin tan head that quickly becomes a light ring.
The nose is huge, a big sweet vanilla and oak bourbon quality with some mixing in dark sweet fruits, a light milky chocolate as well.
The flavor is so big and complex its almost overwhelming, the huge layers of flavors reminds me of Dark Lord. Big and bitter upfront with coffee and burnt smoked, quickly gives way to the bourbon barrel flavor and sweet dark fruits with alcohol. Lots of undertones including some nice vanilla, hints of anise, and heavy dark plums. Fairly balanced in the Sweet/Bitter ratio.
The mouthfeel is thick and full with a big oily finish.
Very drinkable because it is so tasty, I do hate the format, I wish it came in 12oz 4pks like the old Bourbon county, 22oz of this is almost to much, but I did finish it over the course of night. Otherwise Excellent job Goose. 903 charactersbashiba, May 09, 2010
4.82/5  rDev +5.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.522 oz. bottle gradually poured into a snifter
A - Black as night, with a nice, brown head which quickly disappears. There is a lot of rich, brown lacing as the snifter is sipped, but all of it dissipates within minutes, which is enjoyable to watch.
S - Dark chocolate and espresso beans hit the nostrils immediately (almost upon opening the bottle, really). Bourbon and booze are definitely components, and I get a hint or two of maple syrup along the way, as well.
T - True to the nose, this is liquid chocolate complemented by fresh roasted coffee, bourbon, and vanilla. I also taste some mint and toffee here and there. Despite the particular combination of flavors, I wouldn't consider this to be a sugar bomb -- the hops make a valiant stand, almost acting as a prism, shading each of the inherent flavors with a bitterness that masterfully balances this stout. 
M - Very creamy and smooth as silk. This warms the palate and has a great overall feel.
D - As discussed above, this is so well balanced that the chocolate and coffee flavors come across as both sweet and bitter at once, rendering this extremely drinkable. Although I rather enjoy the heat, age should improve this aspect.
I'm 90% sure that if I had to name my favorite stout, this would be it. The remaining 10% of me wants to drink Darkness again before committing to it. This is better balanced than Dark Lord (inc. Vanilla and Oak versions) and more complex than BA Speedway, it's closest competition for my vote.
Regardless, I'm ecstatic with what Goose Island is doing with the BCS brand, and the coffee version completely surpassed my expectations. This is an incredibly enjoyable, intricately detailed stout, and any fan of the style owes it to himself/herself to try it. Seek this out at all costs! 1,782 charactersklikger, May 08, 2010
3.97/5  rDev -13.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4A: Pours a viscous pitch black color. Opaque, no light gets through. A two finger creamy tan head rises quickly. As the foam recedes, a light film of lace is left.
S: Lots of bourbon in the nose. Vanilla, wood, and smoke. Big notes of chocolate and coffee. Very nice.
T: Bourbon overpowers. Sweet vanilla and wood. Tons of chocolate. Some espresso, but not nearly as powerful as I thought it was going to be.
M/D: A full body that thick and creamy smooth. Velvety and decadent. A monster ABV, and it is noticeable. Though a great beer to sip on throughout the night.
More of a liquor than a beer. Just like the regular BCS. Maybe a little more coffee, but it is hard to say. If I had the two side by side, it would be hard to tell them apart. It is a very enjoyable big beer. Though, for what it is, BCS is still king. 819 characterschamp103, May 08, 2010
4.84/5  rDev +5.7%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5A: Pours black with a velvet sheen. held up to the light its actually a bit see through. Head is a nice light brown but quickly dissipates 
S: MMMM thats what i was waiting for! Not to sound like an alcoholic but thats what i want for breakfast. chocolate covered coffee bean with a small shot of bourbon to wash it down. But seriously it smells like a really nice chocolate coffee bean with the vanilla bourbon and a little hint of raisins. once it warms up the alcohol becomes noticeable but still faint for a 13% beer
T: It starts off with some sweet roasted malt then goes bitter with coffee and then end with the bourbon background. This is what the regular Bourbon County needed. Although the coffee adds yet another flavor to the spectrum it somehow brings it all together and tones it down at the same time. Some of the Bourbon County years are a bit much on the bourbon but there is just the right amount of bourbon and coffee that shine through.
M: Just a bit thin actually. Not that i want it to be sweeter but I just want it to be a touch more viscous. Hardly any carbonation which keeps the beer mellow which is nice
D: For such a massive flavored beer it goes down amazingly smooth. The flavors are so upfront when first sipped and then slowly disappear making me yearn for one sip after another. I would have absolutely no problem downing the whole bottle. 1,375 characterschefmikeanderson, May 08, 2010
4.25/5  rDev -7.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4The pour is near black and cannot be seen through when held up to the light. A slight tan head starts to appear, but dissipates. A coating appears along the sides in place of lacing telling me it is viscous. The overall look is average for this type of beer.
The scent is overwhelmingly bourbony. It is a bit much and makes it difficult to smell the other things in the brew. There is some chocolate sweetness and if I stretch...maybe some coffee.
Ah yes, bourbon county hits my mouth. Right up front the coffee appears with some woody oak. It is mild and gives way to a good hit of chocolate and toffee. All the while, bourbon sweetness exists as an overtone throughout the taste. The finish is warm and drying.
This is about a 9 on a scale of 1-10 in terms of thickness. It is very smooth throughout and leaves the mouth sticky and dry.
This is definitely meant to be sipped and the bomber will go slowly. I feel as though I am drinking this a bit premature. A few more months and this should ripen. I will revise this review when the bourbon likely mellows and the flavors meld. 
This is good, but will be better. (ala KBS) 1,131 charactersTCgoalie, May 08, 2010

S: coffee, chocolate, molasses, raisins?, bourbon boozy. Pretty standard.
T: up front, a bit of bourbon, relatively light but then the coffee and chocolate hit you and wow, is it good. The aftertaste is what is driving this rating so high up the charts on BA. Its like I just had coffee and bit into a piece of dark chocolate. The aftertaste keeps you coming back for more.
M: not too thick, not too thin, kinda sticky, pretty good
D: the 13% is hidden very well, until you get about halfway through a bomber and start to feel that warmth in your belly. ha. definitely recommend this beer. is it the 5th best in the world? probably not, but very good nonetheless 836 charactersantoines15, May 08, 2010
4.05/5  rDev -11.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4I had no idea there was as much surrounding this beer as there is. I was lucky enough to snag a single bottle of this today at Bermans in Lexington; thanks for setting it aside for me. With a motor oil like consistency, this beer pours out pitch black with just a lacing for heading. Nose is very rich with coffee, espresso, chocolate and molasses. The taste is pretty much the exact same, and when I say rich, that is exactly what I mean. Very slick on the tongue, and again, like motor oil. The alcohol is masked somewhat by all of the big flavors, which makes for an interesting drinking experience. Is the hype deserved? Yeah I suppose so. Get your bottle today if you see some. 682 charactersjamie2dope, May 07, 2010
2.63/5  rDev -42.6%look: 3.5 | smell: 3 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 1 |  overall: 1Chuck D once told us not to believe the hype. I ought to have listened. This is a good beer, but it isn't the world class brew various members here would seem to suggest it is. 
Appearance - Pitch black, with an adequate oatmeal head that dissipates a bit too quickly, leaving a relatively thick lacing. 
Smell - Ground coffee dominates here, with mild hints of chocolate and bourbon.
Taste - Strongly alcoholic, in fact dominantly so. That it is bourbon-related is less than fully apparent, especially as compared to regular BCS. Coffee is noticeable, but weaker than it ought to be. A bit of molasses I think. Unspecifically sweet, in a cloying sort of way. 
Mouthfeel - Thick, sticky, and extremely hot. Quite unpleasant in its extremity. 
Drinkability - This is a one and done. And I don't just mean on a session basis. It was interesting to try, not something that I'd re-buy. It is just hard to drink something this hot, thick, and and sweet. 953 charactersbeerindex, May 07, 2010
5/5  rDev +9.2%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I can't believe I am saying this but this is the best beer I've ever had. It makes KBS and regular BCS seem average. The aroma and flavor are truly amazing. This beer is much sweeter than the standard BCS. The coffee adds a nice depth and mellows out the bourbon just enough. Mouthfeel is just like BCS, viscous and slightly sticky.
This beer is a masterpiece. Worth the hype and praise. An absolute contender for the BA #1 beer in the world. I never in my life thought I'd give a 5.0 but here it is. I'd buy cases of this if they kept making it. A truly special beer that I'm thankful I went out of my way to find. 616 charactersBrew33, May 07, 2010

5/5  rDev +9.2%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I already know from my samples that I'm going to be very high on this beer, so here we go. Bomber, dated 3/25/10, poured into a small snifter.
I'm not sure what else you do with a 13% imperial stout. It's black, of course, but in this small glass it shows a lot of brown hues at the edges, giving it a bit more character, I suppose. I'd not be so inclined towards a 5.0 if the other aspects of the beer did not dwarf other beers. And by no means is it deficient here. Makes a pretty thin ring, and not much head retention. Not much of a crime. Actually, a very vigorous pour will solve that problem.
The aroma makes me giddy. Such a perfect blend of bold espresso and bourbon and chocolate cake. I don't think three things have ever went together so well. Phenomenal.
I'm searching for the 6.0 to choose. This is the best tasting beer I have ever had. I gave the regular BCS a 5.0, and this is even better with the addition of the espresso. It's a beautiful thing, and it just seems like the natural progression for the beer. The bourbon barrel aging presents a nice spicy oakiness on the finish especially. Espresso adds a bitter element that helps balance the huge sweetness. But fine espressos are rather sweet as well. This is like a rich chocolate cake soaked in espresso and bourbon. I may have went into more detail in my BCS review, but this is all that and more. Those who love that beer are likely to enjoy this even more.
So rich and viscous at first, but transforms into a velvety smooth beer. Carbonation is light and fine. I did not even think to look for the booze until a good few ounces in. Not hot at all.
And it just goes down so easy, and I want sip after sip, and if I had to pick one beer for ever and ever it would be this. I'm so glad I have never given a perfect score to any beer before, because none comes close to this. I first sampled this at WhiskyFest in Chicago, where there was no shortage of extraordinary beverages, and this one blew them out of the water. It helps that the alcohol presence is incredibly mild for a beer this strong. As someone who likes the regular BCS better fresh, I can't see enjoying this a great deal more with age. Glad I still have a few bottles to savor. Completely deserving of my first perfect score. 2,269 charactersommegoose, May 05, 2010
5/5  rDev +9.2%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 522 oz. Bomber poured into a snifter. 
A: Pours a pitch black (dark as night) with a very, very thin mocha/tan colored head. Lacing is very minimal. Overall very pleasing to the eye. 
S: Heavy bourbon smell with a small amount of what I can only describe as a very crisp and clean coffee smell, along with a very faint hint of oak and vanilla. As a side note... very similar to to regular Bourbon County Stouts except for the very pleasing hint of coffee. As it warms the coffee begins to come out a little bit more. 
T: All I can say is wow. I will start off by saying that it is alot like regular BCS except much, much smoother. Due to the smell I thought there would be a huge bourbon bite in the front but this is not the case at all. The coffee is present but not overpowering. It still has the great oak taste and what also seems to be a very faint hint of vanilla, but all of the flavors combine to go down smooth as silk. It is both rich and complex. It definately lives up to the hype. 
M: Very smooth, thick and creamy, with a small amount of carbonation. Again, the bourbon bite was no where near what I expected it to be. 
D: Right now I am praying to the beer gods that Goose Island will make this a year round brew. If it weren't for the limited availability there would be almost nothing else in my cellar after tasting this. 1,344 charactersKanebanger, May 05, 2010
4.82/5  rDev +5.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5(tasted alongside a 2009 Bourbon County Stout for purely scientific purposes)
Classy label, bomber.
Pours dark and thick, just like big brother. Minimal head. A bit of brown on the edges.
Smells enticing. Reminds me a bit of KBS (just a bit), coffee definitely there, but not overpowering. Tobacco, leather, smoke, figs/prunes; all as expected. The coffee really adds to the nose compared to regular BCS. Not as much alcohol either, but it's there and the bourbon is still a player, don't worry. A lot going on.
Taste continues the theme, a more complex, more nuanced BCS. The coffee not only adds, it seems to take away some of the (at times) overpowering molasses/licorice/soy characteristics of regular BCS. I'm realizing that's a good thing as I continue to drink this nectar. Bourbon playing a central role of course, but not dominating things quite like before. Flavors follow the smell, vanilla starts showing up, adding to the taste explosion. 
Smooth but still quite thick. Not as sticky and gooey as regular BCS, however, which is an improvement in my eyes. And it's more drinkable, (I didn't want to stop drinking it, actually.) 
Well, what's left to say? This beer has all that's good about regular BCS, less of what's not, and a sublime infusion of coffee. 
This is how you improve an already outstanding beer. I can't see myself buying regular BCS ever again if this is available. 
I salute you, Goose Island. 1,430 characterscaskstrength, May 04, 2010

This beer pours what you'd expect from an Imperial stout. Pitch black with a collar of khaki head.
The nose is rich and inviting. Bourbon, baker's chocolate, vanilla, and dark coffee blend together perfectly with a tiny note of alcohol.
The taste follows the nose. Lush layers of smoked almonds, chocolate, coffee, bourbon, vanilla, brownie batter, raisins and dates, along with some cinnamon and brown spice., Alf sweat, and maybe some ghostiezzz.
The mouthfeel is sticky on the lips, but creamy and full with the perfect level of carbonation for the style.
A dangerously drinkable beer with a 13%abv. I'm not sure if I could finish a whole bomber by myself, but I wouldn't mind trying. An outstanding beer that eclipses all of the other buzzed stouts out there that I've had. It's worth the hype and then some. Goose Island has been killing it lately.
P.S. Bong the sauce. 1,007 charactersbeertooth, May 04, 2010

Pours a semi-thick black as night color with a thin tan head that reduces to a ring around the glass pretty quickly. I would like to see some more suds on top. Leaves a little lace around the glass.
An orgasm for the nose! I'm not a coffee drinker, but damn does this coffee smell good. Not overpowering, just nice and roasty. Notes of bourbon, vanilla, oak, maple syrup, and caramel are all present. Complex and delicious smelling.
Every bit as complex as the nose. I get a bit of warm bourbon off the bat. This is followed by the perfectly roasted coffee, vanilla, creme brulee, chocolate, oak and maple syrup. Just a wonderful complexity of sweet and roasty. I think some age on this will only increase the taste.
Silky smooth feel in a full body. Not sticky, syrupy or thick feeling. Just right.
Awesome all around beer that lives up to the hype. I have two more bottles, but may need a couple more for aging. For a 13% beer, it drinks so well. Don't miss out on this one! 1,088 charactersjera1350, May 04, 2010
4.57/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Appearance - Pours a jet black with a sliver of dark tan head that quickly dissolves into a dirty halo.
Smell - Bourbon and coffee dominate, with oak, chocolate, and toasty malts. Bourbon is definitely dominates the bouquet.
Taste - Odds are if you are reading this, you're familiar with BCS, so I'll just talk about how it differs. The coffee isn't overly pronounced, but rather accentuate the dark roast flavors already present. Also, the beer is much more mellow. Still has all of the great bourbon/oak with much less bite.
Mouthfeel - It's heavy on the palate and quite syrupy. A pleasant amount of carbonation. The finish is gently warming, much improved over BCS.
Drinkability - BCCS and BCS are certainly different, but it's by no means night and day. It is certainly more mellow, more nuanced, and more drinkable. Good stuff! 837 charactersyeahnatenelson, May 04, 2010
5/5  rDev +9.2%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5#16
I'm a huge fan of aged BCS (18 months is my liking), not so much on the fresh stuff, so let's see how this infant compares...
Bomber poured into a snifter, 6-8oz at a time.
A: Pours PITCH black with just a hint of dark caramel head. Seems really thick and adhears to the sides of the glass with a 10w motor oil. Beautiful... 5.0
S: A huge rush of the most heavenly of scents; ground coffee, bourbon, sweet molasses...like a Bourbon version of a Bailey's Irish coffee. As I let this warm, I continued to salivate at the smell. 5.0
T: The bourbon, rich coffee bitterness, slight sweetness blend together seamlessly. The heat of a young BCS is completely hidden by the roasted Black Cat. The amount of richness and complexity is incredible. I can't believe how well done this is right off the shelf. 5.0
M/D: Once again, the smoothness of the mouthfeel, low carbonation, and longevity of the aftertaste complete this as the best beer I have ever had. Along with the possibility this could IMPROVE with age, this gets my 1st and only 5.0 until another beer comes along and makes me change my mind.

5/5  rDev +9.2%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I was looking forward to trying this beer and wondered if it would really live up to the hype. Not only did it live up to it, it exceeded it.
A- Black with little foam
S- This one is huge. The best smell of coffee and bourbon together that I have ever encountered.
T- The espresso in this sends the bourbon stout to a new level. This is the most well balanced beer I have ever tasted. Remarkable considering how complex this beer is.
M- Smooth. 
D- Considering the abv, this beer is unbelievably drinkable. 
This beer is absolutely phenomonal. I picked up a few bottles and am looking forward to enjoying this one through the aging process. 646 characterslowlight3, May 03, 2010
4.4/5  rDev -3.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Shared with bmanning, Azurelimits, amyliz4, and hhanson at a recent tasting.
A: Pours much like the regular Bourbon County Stout--rich black and quite oily with a nice, thick mocha head. 
S: Intense chocolate mocha espresso with quite a bit of bourbon coming through as well. Pretty strong vanilla presence along with roasted malt, oak, and molasses.
T: The bourbon comes out a bit more, mixing with loads of dark chocolate and espresso. Some roasted malt and residual sweetness, but mostly the interplay between the bourbon, chocolate, and coffee.
M: Heavy and viscous. The initial sip is quite a bit of alcohol heat, but the other flavors begin to take over as it warms toward room temperature.
D: This is one heavy, intense brew. A bomber between 5 people was more than enough. Very tasty, although I imagine it'd be hard to finish even a 12oz. bottle alone. 866 charactersThorpe429, May 03, 2010
4.87/5  rDev +6.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5This is THE hype beer right now, and I'm an unabashed fan of 'regular' BCS. Let's see how this compares...
Poured from a red-labeled bomber into a 10-oz. snifter.
A - Pours like a shot of Cuban coffee. Thick, black, and a bit of foam. The head is deep mocha-colored and dissipates quickly into a ring that stays around for most of the drink.
S - Huge. This is the most massive nose I've ever encountered. Imagine that someone axed open a bourbon barrel in the middle of your favorite gourmet coffee shop. Bourbon-infused wood and rich, roasted espresso and little else.
T - Very similar to black-label BCS at first, bourbon ascendant with some roasted malt, vanilla, and caramel. But as this sucker warms, the Intelligentsia-brewed espresso makes its presence felt in a big way. Semi-sweet chocolate chips join in, and this is an absolute epic in terms of flavor.
M - Smooth, full-bodied, and creamy. The carbonation and alcohol burn show up strongly in the finish, but that in no way detracts from this brew's obliterating impact on the palate. That is a good thing, btw.
D - Unbelievable for a beer of this magnitude and ABV. Like smoking a tightly-wrapped cigar or perfectly-packed pipe. The alcohol burn is all that keeps this from being a 5. 
This beer, in little more than a week and a half, has surpassed Dark Lord on the BA Top 100. Will it stay? Hard to tell, but with ratings and reviews like mine streaming in, it's hard to see it becoming forgotten a year from now. If you live in the Chicago area, track down one of the few remaining bottles. If you don't, set up those trades now. 1,601 charactersAJacob81, May 03, 2010

Pours a 1/2 finger of tan head. Fades to a thick ring. Leaves some splattered lace. Color is a pitch black. Pretty solid.
Aroma: Huge roasted malt and bourbon flavors up front. Sweet vanilla and caramel. Rich espresso and coffee flavors. Awesome oak flavors. Some chocolate as well. Reminds me a lot of KBS. This is amazing.
Taste: Sweet vanilla and bourbon up front. Nice oak flavors. Rich espresso and coffee. The caramel and chocolate flavors are more subtle but add a nice layer to this beer. This beer reminds me so much of kbs. I would like to do a side by side. 
Mouthfeel: Smooth, warming, and a bit creamy. Pretty full bodied, but not that thick and chewy. Medium amount of carbonation. Ends warm, bourbony, and slightly dry.
Overall, this is a solid beer and I am glad I have access to it. It reminds me so much of kbs. Doing a side by side would be awesome. This beer is very drinkable and 11 oz is not enough for me. This beer is legit. A must try.

Liquid perfection, this beer is mind blowing. Huge massive bourbon notes with a smooth lingering espresso. Roasted malts and oak flavors are also very prevalent. I went into this beer with huge expectations and it surpassed them all. Wow.
Mouthfeel is rich, thick, creamy, and amazing. Medium carbonation, taste lingers on the tongue for hours.

4.97/5  rDev +8.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 52011 update 2/6/2012:
The 2011 version of this beer maintains everything that I loved about the first time I had it, and somehow is even better.
I opened a 2011 bottle at cellar temperature and another was opened at fridge temperature at Kelly's Pub.
Like every other bourbon county (and variant) I have opened, this viscous black imperial stout oozes out of the bottle like some kind of black tar. Pitch black with just the slightest mahogany brown edges. The bottle I opened up at cellar temperature manufactured a robust mocha brown head on the initial pour into my snifter. With the ABV, the cap was not destined to last long, but it still provided a nice thin film over the beer and a frothy ring around the edge of the glass. When opened at colder temperatures, it is much more difficult to get much of any head to form, even with an aggressive pour.
The biggest difference in my mind between the two vintages is the aroma. The Anjilanaka coffee beans used in this year's batch simply explode out of the bottle when opened and waft up from the glass throughout the glass. As a coffee drinker, this is simply heaven. This coffee smells thoroughly roasted, with notes of hazelnut and burnt caramel in addition to a distant fruit note. Dark roasted malt, bitter chocolate, molasses, vanilla, oak, and bourbon all fade to the back behind a dominant coffee presence. There is no alcohol anywhere in the nose.
The flavor is still very coffee-forward, but much more balanced than the aroma. Fresh Bolivian coffee roasted to perfection comes through first, with a strong showing from the dark, bitter chocolate, and roasted malt. Each of these blend and interact so well with the others flavors, creating an ever-changing wall of roasted and bitter flavors. Vanilla, molasses, and bourbon step in next, adding some sweetness and further depth to the flavor. The bourbon presence grows as the sip progresses and my tongue accustoms itself to the bitter coffee and roasted malt flavors. By the end, I get a bit more vanilla and some light oak as well. It has varying degrees of bitterness all the way through, with a clear emphasis on the coffee.
The mouthfeel is exactly what I want in an imperial stout, and even though I have tried quite a few since I first had the Bourbon County Coffee, I have yet to find its equal. Each sip coats my entire mouth and tongue with a chewy, grainy, and smooth liquid. The flavors seem to permeate into every part of my mouth, and it is more of an experience that just 'drinking' the beer. The carbonation is perfectly tuned to the ultra thick and viscous nature of the beer, giving it a milky creaminess and never getting in the way.
This is as close to a perfect beer as I can think of; it is just absolutely incredible.
Original review: 4.5/4.5/5/5/5
Poured from a 22 oz. bottle into a snifter. Bottled 3/26/10. #2133.
Appearance: This almost oozes out of the bottle, it is that thick. The color is completely pitch black, with thin brown head, which quickly erodes to a ring. It communicates the message - "Be ready, this is intense."
Smell: A charismatic aroma; a smooth blend of robust roasted malt, roast coffee, with a nice bourbon presence, some bitter chocolate, and a few lingering alcohol phenols. 
Taste: Wow. If Bourbon County Stout is a smokey dragon, this is the well-refined dragon you can take out to a fancy dinner. It is wonderfully put together, with a smooth flavor all the way through. Roasted malt with hints of chocolate and vanilla start the sip, with roast coffee and bourbon balancing each other out. There is a slightly bitter aftertaste, and the alcohol warms the stomach. There is no real alcohol bite, though, which is quite surprising. The espresso flavor prevents this from being as overtly smokey and boozy like the regular BCS. Substantially better in my opinion.
Mouthfeel: Could this be any smoother? Creamy, with perky carbonation contained in a very full body.
Drinkability: I could sip this all day and all night. There is enough complexity to keep the whole glass interesting, but the smooth construction makes each sip wonderfully simple. I just had a revelation. 4,152 charactersKickInTheChalice, May 03, 2010
4.7/5  rDev +2.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours midnight black with a thick creamy tan head that dissipates to a thin ring.
Aroma is huge bourbon and espresso coffee notes along with a sticky sweetness. Chocolate and dark fruit and a hint of earthy anise character.
Taste is sweet and rich chocolatey espresso. Dark grain and bourbon soaked dark fruit with a generous dose of molasses and brown sugar rounds it out. Finishes with lingering anise and earthy hop bitterness. 
Mouthfeel is thick, full, and velvety smooth.
Rich and bold in flavor. Not much charred smokey quality, but plenty of chocolate, bourbon, dark fruit and coffee to keep you coming back for more. If you like big boozy stouts... this is a must try. 681 charactersBlakaeris, May 02, 2010

A--Darker than the dark side of the moon with a small brown foamless head
S- Tons of bourbon and coffee..bourbon always comes across as vanilla/caramel to me.
T- Un-freaking-real. Well balanced mix of bourbon, coffee and alcohol. The alcohol is surprising not overwhelming at 13%. Until I had this BCS was the best liquid to hit my lips.
M- Thick and Oily, very characteristic of this beer and it's parent beer.
D- Again, for 13% this is a great drink but definitely a sipper and one to enjoy. Better as it warms in my opinion. 615 charactersAstroAcks6, May 02, 2010
4.97/5  rDev +8.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Holy crap. So I have been dying to try this one and spent the day up in Asheville yesterday. While there stopped in to visit a friend who low and behold had managed to acquire a bottle of this gem. Needless to say I made him open it and split it with me, lol. Served chilled and poured into twin snifters, this one was consumed on 04/30/2010.
The pour was sublime. Dark as night, black, inky, oily just full of everything big and mean you could possibly want out of a huge stout. Nice small tan head then rises up and settles across the top leaving a little bit of lacing and a smooth and consistent coating along the inside of the glass. 
The aroma was the thins that dreams are made of. Rich coffee smacks you in the face from the first sip, but then slowly melts into a seemless mix of vanilla, rich bourbon notes, delicate sweet chocolate and rich roasted malts. Perfect in every way. I could not have imagined this actually coming across any better. Then I took the first sip and the velvety smooth, sensual and completely coating nature of it took over. Incredible amounts of coffee up from but the vanilla is starting to steal the show for me over. Really just the most thick, viscous, and wonderful full bodied stout I could have had. Rich bourbon and vanilla are all over the place here and each is simply stunning in its own right, but when combined they are perfect. Huge coffee flavor without a touch of bitterness and the rich and smooth vanilla flavor sits on the tongue long after the last sip is gone.
Overall this is mindblowing. One of the best beers I have ever had by a mile. Insanely good. Please go find this one, it is worth every last second of your time. 1,682 charactersmikesgroove, May 01, 2010
4.92/5  rDev +7.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5My first BA review! Boy did I pick a wicked awesome beer to start with.
A - Very very black. Very small head, quickly dissipating.
S - Just like the bottle says. Heavy bourbon and coffee aromas. I think I got a little vanilla out of it as well.
T - Amazing. I am not a fan of the regular Bourbon County at all, its far too boozy for my liking. This, however, is fantastic. The coffee balances the bourbon flavor so nicely. The bourbon is apparent, but not a kick in the face. Heavy coffee and bourbon flavors. Light cream and woody flavors.
M - Thick. My friend described it as "chewable". I am a fan of thick beers though, so this is good for me.
D - I could drink this all night, or at least until I pass out from the 13% abv. I have to say that I was not a fan of this beer when it warmed to room temperature. It really intensified the bourbon and kinda killed the coffee flavor to me. Keep this lightly chilled and it is perfect.
Overall a simply fantastic beer worth trying. 985 charactersy1fsm8s, May 01, 2010
4.23/5  rDev -7.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Jet black with a thin tan head that fades quickly.
Smell is heavy bourbon, chocolatey roasted malts, with a touch of vanilla espresso. The coffee is surprisingly subdued. Dark chocolate, caramel, and some alcohol.
Taste is more heavy bourbon and roasted, chocolatey malts. Again, the coffee presence is not as prominent as expected. Rich notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, and vanilla come in. Good malt backbone, as the malts carry to the finish.
Mouthfeel is smooth and velvety, with some heat from the alcohol. Finish is slightly sticky. Medium-heavy body.
For a sipper, this one is good. The alcohol is quite assertive in the smell and taste, and the bourbon presence is very heavy. I think this one will mellow out with some age though. 738 charactersParrotbeak, May 01, 2010
4.73/5  rDev +3.3%look: 2.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A - Pours darker than dark with a 1/8 of an inch head, no lacing at all. Other than the impressive soulless black, it's somewhat boring after the initial pour. 
s - Freshly roasted coffee, milk & dark chocolate, only a hint of bourbon and vanilla. The coffee aroma is pungent, reminds me of walking into a coffee shop. 
T - Nice even bourbon flavor throughout, chocolate notes all over the place, present but not overpowering coffee and espresso flavors. The coffee is mind blowing, a perfect blend of fresh roast with some mildly bitter acid and grinds makes for an incredibly satisfying balance of sweet thanks to the bourbon and chocolate and bitter from the dark chocolate and coffee. 
D - I let this one warm up and it was just a delicious and drinkable as it was when I first cracked it. Even though most of the carbonation had vacated the beer, the viscosity of the beer still made it highly satisfying.
I can't wait to crack another one of these open and try to continue pulling out all the nuances this has to offer. 1,029 charactersdrewba, May 01, 2010
4.2/5  rDev -8.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4A: Pitch black with a mocha colored head that is only about a quarter inch thick. The head does not retain very well, but there is one nice tan ring around the top of the beer.
S: A potent blend of chocolate and vanilla followed by a roasted espresso note. The bourbon is quite prevalent as well and brings out a slightly earthy wood quality.
T: At first it reminds of of eating coffee ice cream with that robust yet semi sweet flavor, and then mixed with a powerful bourbon note. There is a nice chocolate and vanilla swirled ice cream note that is quite enjoyable and a bitterness from the espresso in the end which is quite enjoyable. Some smokiness in there too which is nice
M: There is a boozy quality to this, but that is from the bourbon, not fusal alcohol. Smoothing out some of the roughness would benefit the beer. It is also a bit thinner than i expected, much like a spirit
D: This is a beer that borders the line between a spirit and a beer. The bourbon is very present which i enjoy, but the alcohol is definitely noticeable. Maybe chilled a bit under room temperature would help 1,098 charactersmikey711, May 01, 2010

Pours pitch black with one finger of light tan head, dense and thick...given a 5 because of how perfect the rest of the beer was, hard to rate an imperial stout...
Wonderful sweet smell of bourbon and vanilla. Some molasses and sweet chocolate overwhelm a week bitter roasted malt and very subtle coffee aroma...
Think regular Bourbon County Stout but 100% more smooth and easy to drink. Delicious! Sweet bourbon goodness with loads of vanilla and some molasses and dark chocolate. Very sweet, very little hint of coffee, perfect!...
Full bodied and incredibly creamy and smooth. Completely coats the palette with thick creamy bourbon/vanilla/chocolate goodness...incredible...
WOW! Blown away by this one...not usually a huge fan of any beer that has "coffee" in the title...I did not taste much coffee at all in this beer, all I tasted was a regular Bourbon County Stout tuned down a notch with incredible aroma, taste and feel, the drinkability is through the roof compared to regular BCS. Incredible beer, that's all I can say...pretty sure this is my first perfect score in 100+ reviews...it deserves it... 1,184 charactershawks10, May 01, 2010
4.95/5  rDev +8.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Finally breaking into one of my bottles... I've had this on tap at Goose Island's Stout Fest, then again last weekend at DLD...and now I've caved and opened up one of my bottles. Not sure what I can say that hasn't already been said - its truly THAT good... EASILY is one of the best beers I've ever had. Pours a lovely black with a very minimal amout of light tan head. 
The aroma is overwhelmingly good with notes of chocolate, vanilla, and espresso. Flavors match up to the aroma very nicely. I'm not a fan of the regular BCS because IMO the bourbon is too strong in that one, but here - the coffee notes balance out the bourbon perfectly and make this beer INSANELY drinkable.
I really hope they make this again just so that more people have the chance to try it. OUTSTANDING. 782 charactersthetomG, May 01, 2010
4.74/5  rDev +3.5%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Sipping this magical concoction tonight... Black Cat espresso is probably my all time favorite coffee, and BCS is one of my all-time favorite stouts. I approve of this marriage of two intense and fantastic beverages. 
Initial pour into a couple Duvel tulips yields a finger of sturdy mocha foam, leaving random spotty lacing around the edges. Black with a mahogany ring at the edge when held up to the light. Foam breaks, leaving a bare skim, then a thin ring at the edge. Considering the high abv, this is expected. 
Huge dark chocolate and espresso nose, with brown sugar and cinnamon trailing in the finish. Smoothed out with no sharpness from the bourbon, the oak and vanilla are there though. 
Sticky on the lips, rich with deep flavors. Bittersweet chocolate, vanilla, coffee, coconut, smooth and sweet, luscious. Amazingly silky and rich. Again, the rough edges of fresh BCS have been sanded down, leaving a streamlined, supple, coffee-infused incarnation. Somewhat more approachable for that reason. 
Overall a surprise hit variation of BCS, tailored for lovers of coffee, bourbon, and stouts....
2011: Anjilanaka... wow, they topped the subtlety of the first batch with a straight up toasted marshmallow/melted dark chocolate/deep roasty coffee BOMB. Rich as all hell, sticky and decadent. Awe inspiring... 1,320 charactersemerge077, May 01, 2010

Poured jet black with a nice brown/tan head. Exactly what I had expected.
Smells amazing...Definately can smell the bourbon with that nice hint of coffee in the background. Could not wait to take my first sip
This beer is one of the best I have ever had. Simply amazing. Tastes much like it smells...bourbon hits you up front, then the espresso hits you on the back end. Simply amazing. 
This beer is pretty powerful, so the drinkability suffers a bit, but you have to finish the bottle, right?
Overall, an amazing experience 628 charactersprophetofdoom, May 01, 2010
4.33/5  rDev -5.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Served in my Sam Adams special pint glass....alas no snifter. Pours a deep dark nearly black cola brown which only shows through on the edges when held up to the light. A nice cinnamon brown head makes an appearance, then exits stage left to leave only a ring around the edges. Of course the Sam Adams glass keeps a small amount of head forming during consumption....
Smell is bourbon, coffee, and chocolate with hints of peaty smoky soil all mixed together in a beautiful symphony. Thought the smell itself if not the coffee presence would be stronger...
Taste is more of the same...Chocolate, coffee and bourbon like the smell with hints of leather and tobacco showing through. Molassas laced with brown sugar and bourbon complete the taste. Creamy light carbonation compliments the medium thick viscosity of the liquid perfectly....excellent.
Drinkability suffers because of the ABV and the fact that it's almost too rich....still tasty, but finishing off the bottle by myself will be a chore...
Reminds me ever so much of KBS or Devil Over a Barrel on steroids. Lovely looks, beautiful taste and perfect mouthfeel leave me looking forward to the rest of the bottle and the others that I purchased. Can't wait until Vanilla BCS makes an appearance later this year.... =) 1,273 charactersEliteDigger, Apr 30, 2010

Deep black pour with a tan head. Looks divine, just like BCS does.
Man... this smells like the freshest coffee with an overload of bourbon. Amazing at 9a! Once you get past the initial wave, you get chocolate, coconut, molasses and oak. Actually, oak is probably the third most dominant smell.
First sip, you are knocked the fuck out! Overwhelming amounts of fresh flavor. Chocolate, vanilla, oak and bourbon at first but a ton espresso in the back. Lots of roast with smoothed out bourbon.
Thick and smooth... perfect. Just too strong to be considered drinkable. Enjoy what you have, because pound for pound, this is right up there with the best. If you're like me and think the regular BCS is too strong, give this a try because the coffee balances this out more than I could imagine! 813 charactersrudylaw, Apr 30, 2010

BOTTLED ON: 03/26/10 2114
I was lucky enough to be at Binny's, in Chicago, last week when these were delivered. Grabbed a couple of bottles, happily.
Just like it should, this pours up black. It has a dark brown head of foam that is just about one-fingers worth thick. The retention is good and fades to a surface covering film. The lacing is very good and tries it's best to be sticky. The liquid leaves a thin filmy/oily coating though and the lacing keeps sliding back down because of this.
Wow, does that smell good! It has all of the bourbon presence of BCS but it is joined by a very wonderful presence of dark roasted coffee. These smells don't cancel/balance each other out so much as they just compliment each other. A big, rich, chocolate profile is joined by a very nice roasted malt presence. Definite hints of vanilla and oak. Less obvious notes of caramel, brown sugar and dark fruits. 
Damn, that is smooth and delicious. This is a very big and bold beer, yet it is smooth enough that it doesn't come off as heavy-handed.
Very nice vanilla notes hit me first, followed by butterey oak and bourbon notes. Lots of chocolate mixes with a slight brown sugar presence. This gives way to a deep, dark, rich, coffee profile that is beyond my expectations. It finishes with a light touch of caramel and just a hint of dark fruits. The finish is rich and long-lingering.
The taste of the bourbon is here, but there isn't a trace of booziness. No heat at all.
This one is full-bodied and has a nice, medium level of carbonation. It is incredibly smooth and has a fantastic level of creaminess to it.
I don't taste the 13.00%abv, but it's not hiding it's effects. This is extremely smooth, well balanced, complex, and highly drinkable. Just be careful with it! 1,819 characterscoldmeat23, Apr 29, 2010

Pours pitch black with a decent-sized, well-retained tan head.
Aroma hits you with a blast of intense, awesome coffee. But that's not all! Behind that there's the awesomeness of regular Bourbon County Stout - smooth roast and rich chocolate, oak, bourbon, and vanilla. Wow.
Flavor is perhaps even more outstanding. I sometimes find the bourbon in regular Bourbon County Stout to be too much, but in this version, maybe it's the coffee, but the level seems just right. Really mellows out. The coffee flavor is incredible, and the base stout flavors of roasted malt, toffee, and dark chocolate fudge really assert themselves and meld together seamlessly. Some very slight barrel notes as well.
Smooth, creamy, and full-bodied on the palate with slight bitterness from the coffee. Not really that boozy at all for 13%, but there is some alcohol warmth present.
Overall, wow, what a beer. Highly drinkable, as downing this is just a heavenly experience. ISO more bottles! 1,161 charactersnickd717, Apr 28, 2010

S: the front of the nose has two huge flavors in coffee and bourbon, not one manages to dominate, but the bourbon seems to be slightly stronger, the coffee is bold and robust and blends expertly with the bourbon. These strong notes are accented with subtle notes of chocolate, oak, and molasses. This smells like something special. Reminds me of KBS with the bourbon kicked up a notch.
T: wow, this beer is absolutely PACKED with flavor. My palate is overwhelmed at first sip, but as I continue on, I pick out a lot of chocolate, vanilla, and bourbon on the front followed by espresso bean with heat on the finish. The finish features notes of sweet dark chocolate which are countered by roasty coffee notes. Impressive.
MF: huge thick body, velvety smooth texture, somewhat chewy, low carbonation
D: Goose Island hit the jackpot with this beer. This is my favorite variant of BCS yet (EDIT: after trying Rare, this is now my second favorite variant). Considering its rich nature, I would prefer if this beer were sold in 4 packs. But bottom line- this beer is solid! 1,172 charactershomebrew311, Apr 28, 2010

Appearance is terrific... pitch black... a little bit of a fizzy head which I wasn't expecting, but it settled down into a nice 1/4" head... that then settled into a lace-inducing cap... lots of legs and stick.
Aroma is downright, insanely great. Huge dark chocolate, malty, coffee and a boozy linger... wonderful woody background. One of the best.
Smooth mouthfeel... creamy and coating... just the right amount of alcohol burn on the back end.
Exceptional flavor. Roasted goodness. Bit of licorice and a lot of espresso... wonderful slight bitterness to set off the sweet. 612 charactersFugazme, Apr 28, 2010

A: 1/4 finger head; mocha colored head with a black as night color; beauty of a stout. 
S: Oats, coffee, bourbon, God's semen, nuttiness... Everything you can ask for in a beer. This is the best smelling beer I've ever tasted. Let me repeat: THIS IS THE BEST SMELLING BEER I'VE EVER TASTED.
T: EVEN BETTER THAN THE SMELL. I'm honestly thinking of doing the rest of the review in caps to emphasize how awesome this beer is. Coffee and bourbon balanced with oat nuttiness. The beer is smooth, sits in your mouth and is full yet not overdone. This beer is as perfect a thing as I've ever tasted, I don't know if anything better could be brewed.
D/M: Just great, I could drink this all day (if I had more than $20 in my bank account) and it is so smooth and rich and awesome!
This is the petron of beers, the Marissa Miller of beers, the Jimi Hendrix of beers, etc. End of story, you need to drink this... now. 951 charactersjt31914, Apr 27, 2010

4.87/5  rDev +6.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Couldn't wait and had to pop one of these bombers today. Poured into a Duvel snifter.
A: Thick and deep brown black as it filters into the glass. Head forms quite readily, a ruby brown inch thick number that lasts suprisingly long considering the booze content in this beer, really adds to the anticipation of this beer.
S: This is the embodiment of an imperial coffee stout. At first there is a massive punch of super dark, super fresh coffee beans like walking into a room full of fresh ground coffee then it gets woody, the bourbon barrel character shining though and coupling up with the coffee aromas. Rich dark chocolate, molasses mixed with vanilla bean.
T/MF: First and most apparent impressions on taste: you get the barrel character right away with a little bit of closing heat. Loads of coffee, rich, dark and deeply bitter. As the beer gets warmer the bourbon aspect becomes far more apparent. While initially the wood of the barrel was detectable, now with some warmth the stuff that used to be inside can be distinguished. Feel is silky smooth, softly carbonated, feels like velvet cake on the tongue with traces of heat in the finish and a lasting dryness. Nothing cloying, nothing over the top, like I think the normal Bourbon County can be guilty of when it's young, this beer is near perfection in a bottle.
D: Like I said this beer is near perfection. I will never really understand what exceptional means when it comes to the appearance on a stout, I feel like it's more of a judgment call/ depends on how you are feeling that day when it comes to beers of this caliber. A bit hot in the finish, can't wait to see how this beer develops. Love love love the fact that this beer is readily available and is not hoarded like KBS, easily on par and maybe even passes it in terms of coffee barrel aged beers. A beer to be sought out for sure! 1,861 charactersbluemoonswoon, Apr 27, 2010
4.72/5  rDev +3.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4I drank this from a 22oz bottle into my Orval glass.
The beer pours jet black with a very light tan head that only rises about a finger and is gone right away. Medium lacing. 
The aroma is really nice and smells just like a bcs with coffee. A very sweet smooth coffee with a hint of vanilla and oak at the end.
The taste is also tons of coffe, but its so smooth and easy to drink. There a whisps of bcs in here but mostly on the finish when you get some vanilla and bourbon. Other than that seems like a totally different beer, but an awesome beer.
The feel is on the lighter side in terms of weight, but its dense and coating, not much of a lasting flavor.
Super easy to drink.
This beer is awesome, a great play on bcs, can't wait to get some age on this. 763 charactersjrallen34, Apr 27, 2010
4.85/5  rDev +5.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Pours black with a finger of head that camps around forever.
The aroma is a nice mix of fudge, oak, toffee, bourbon heat, and fresh roasted gourmet coffee. Very deep and complex, yet seemingly a bit more subdued than regular BCS. Probably because the alcohol heat is toned down quite a bit. Excellent.
The taste is just outstanding. Every single flavor present in your favorite vintage of BCS is there. The coffee addition has done nothing to hide any sort of underlying complexity present. It also does not overwhelm the flavor profile at all...rather, the coffee merely adds additional depth and boldness to take the place of the crazy bourbon heat that you would normally expect to be there. Yes, that's right, the bourbon heat is toned down significantly over standard BCS. Sure, it is still quite hot and if you are not a fan of barrel aged beers then you most definitely will not be a fan of this. However, that heat is a necessary component in my opinion because what comes along with it is a huge amount of toffee, vanilla, and oak complexity from the barrel aging process. 
The body is full and the carbonation is plentiful and the mouthfeel is creamy. Exactly what should be expected from a world class stout.
Drinkability is enormous when you consider the type of beer we are talking about here. A 13% ABV bourbon and coffee bomb? Sounds like a recipe for a 4-way bottle split. But HELL NO, this one needs to be drank all alone. Nurse this one all night long and watch your enjoyment grow exponentially from start to finish. Once that heat numbs the tongue a little and becomes more tolerable, all the subtlety and balance begins to really become apparent.
Overall, this is the best new beer I've had in a while and possibly the best "readily available" beer in the market right now. I put readily available in parentheses because once everyone gets a taste of this, every case in existence will fly off the shelves quicker than you can hop on Beer Advocate and plea with people to "STOP HOARDING ALL THE COFFEE BCS" 2,032 charactersalcstradamus, Apr 27, 2010
4.45/5  rDev -2.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Practically black in color with a hint of mohagany around the edges. The head is small, short lived, but dense for it's brief stay. No lacing. After the head departs, there is just darkness. 
It smells just like BCS, but a hint of dark roasted coffee. Imagine that. I was expecting more coffee. The bourbon notes still overpower the newest addition. 
It's best to let this warm for a while. Straight out of the fridge, the coffee is muted and it taste almost exactly like normal BCS. However, once it gets to just under room temp the Black Cat starts to pop. It doesn't show up until the finish, but the finish is almost strictly espresso. The front end has wonderful notes of vanilla, oak, and chocolate. 
Just like regular BCS, the mouthfeel is untouchable. It's so thick and creamy you almost have to chew it. It is boozy, but that's how this one needs to be done. 
One bomber is plenty. I'd prefer to have just one, and two is the max. It's delicious, but a beast. More than two could get dangerous. 
I'm definitely going to lay one down for while. 1,057 charactersVonerichs, Apr 26, 2010
5/5  rDev +9.2%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Had a fairly large pour of this during DLD. Review from notes on 4/24/10
A - poured deep black with a short lived tan head. Faint brown edges in the light. Looks very enticing, Wisps of spiderweb bubbles lining the surface. 4.5
S - Good gracious, I thought BCS was a fine sniffer, this is simply fantastic. The coffee adds so much complexity to the beer. It is a mellowed and well balanced BCS with a touch of roasty coffee overtone to it. Of course, vanilla, oak, and bourbon are present. But damn. 5.0
T - Fantastic. Very much like the aromatic experience. All the flavors have melded together wonderfully. Lots of roastiness, coffee, and vanilla, which are the most prominent. The sharpness of the bourbon has been rounded out nicely. Dark fruits as well. 5.0
M - Thick, rich, viscous, chewy. This is a big beer. Smooth and velvety carbonation. 5.0
D - Extremely. Drinks like a 7% beer. 5.0 898 charactersDmanGTR, Apr 26, 2010
4.49/5  rDev -2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 422 oz bottle split and poured into a Duvel tulip. "Develops for up to 5 years in the bottle", "Serve in a snifter", "Made with Intelligentsia Black Cat espresso", 13% ABV, bottled on 03/26/10.
A - A tall pour reveals the totally black beer to be clear. Even with the height of the pour, the head only reaches a thin layer of dense tan foam. Low retention and no lace but legs from the swirl are left on the glass. Dark mahogany-brown highlights are noticeable around the top edge of the glass towards the end.
S - The nose is massive with black roasted coffee and a smooth backing of milk chocolate. The bourbon is strong in the nose but even for it's young age it's got a mellow, smooth alcohol quality. It's not hot. A hint of earthy wood ties the well-balanced aroma together. A vigorous swirl brings the alcohol out to a really potent level.
T - Yowza! That'll strip paint right off any surface. Despite the well-balanced alcohol in the nose, the flavor is majorly boozy with a hot alcohol punch that overshadows the espresso. The aftertaste comes in slowly and more balanced with deliciously roasted espresso, chocolate malt hints, and creamy milk. Awesome flavor but after a year at least, it'll really shine well.
M - Smooth as black velvet and soft on the tongue with a creamy finish. Full-bodied and thick with a roasted bitter finish that's overtaken but a really warm alcohol sensation in the mouth, throat, and stomach.
D - Very good balance and flavor to this BCCS, but with it's young age the alcohol is a bit too harsh, especially with the first few sips. I can't wait to try this beer with age on it! The coffee flavor is fantastic and could use more bringing out. 1,685 charactersBeerFMAndy, Apr 25, 2010
4.9/5  rDev +7%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Grabbed a bomber of this at Binny's today.
A- Absolutely black. I am trying really hard, but I can't make light come through this at all, even on the edges. Small dark brown head doesn't last long. Looks challenging, almost intimidating.
S- Bourbon, coffee, toffee.
T- Absolutely stunning. It is very similar to the regular Bourbon County stout, but the coffee balances it out better.
M/D- Wow, this beer is one of the best I've ever had. Brilliant work by Goose Island. 474 charactersschanker21, Apr 25, 2010
5/5  rDev +9.2%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A - Very dark, basically black, opaque, no light coming through on this one. Very small, slightly less than one finger head bubbled up on this. The head is made of super fine bubbles, almost looking solid in some sense, very rarely have I seen one like this, in some ways the lack of size on the head makes this look more refined.
S - Hard on the bourbon, this smells a lot like the regular BCS, but there's a deep, and almost subtle hint of coffee aroma here. It's present, but it's not overpowering like way too many coffee stouts seem to do. Vanilla notes and roasted malts. Quite amazing.
T - I rarely give 5's on anything, but this is fantastic. In a year, I can only imagine it gets better as the bourbon smoothes out more. Has the characteristic bourbon taste that blends nicely with some dark chocolate. The coffee here is just like the smell, a rich, dark background flavor that tastes very refined, and lingers in the background without overpowering anything. I don't like coffee beers, but somehow GI has used coffee to improve on one of my favorite beers. Some light vanilla, and I actually feel like I taste coconut in this one a little bit.
M - Heavy and smooth. Very thick and syrupy, just like it should be.
D - Could do the bomber, which is a hell of an accomplishment considering how rich and high ABV this is. Could possibly go for more, it's a great slow slipper to take up some of your time, as it gets more interesting as it warms up. I honestly think this is the best beer I've ever had. 1,514 charactersAgentZero, Apr 25, 2010
4.23/5  rDev -7.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Pours black with a small tan colored head. This beer is BLACK, it's not letting any light through. There's just something great about pouring such a thick and black beer into my glass.
Smells like coffee, chocolate, and bourbon. Good smell, but nothing unexpected.
The coffee is a great addition to the BCS taste. The bourbon is a bit subdued in this version. The usual chocolate and vanilla flavors are here. The alcohol is not very prominent considering how fresh this is. With some time, this will be even better. Considering the addition of coffee, this is surprisingly smooth, and not bitter. It's very syrupy and sweet.
Mouthfeel is thick, slick, and full bodied. Low carbonation. Smooth. Leaves my mouth and tongue feeling slick.
Drinkability is low overall, fine for the style. I split a bomber of this, and I think that was the perfect amount. A bomber by myself would be do-able, but any more would be overkill. Definitely a sipping beer for me. Which is exactly what I expected.
Overall, this is a solid beer. It doesn't blow away the normal BCS, but it's definitely good, and I'd give it a slight edge due to how smooth it is, how the alcohol is hidden even before aging, and the excellent coffee taste. 1,220 charactersghostee, Apr 24, 2010
5/5  rDev +9.2%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5After having this beer I felt inspired to leave my first review. I had the opportunity to try this at the Goose Island Clybourn Pub a few weeks ago, but am reviewing this beer based off of a bottle bought today after the release. Split a couple of bombers with three friends of mine.
The appearance is thick and allows very little light to pass through on the edges. The head is a brown, similar to the crema on a perfect shot of Black Cat Espresso. A swirl allows the beer to coat this glass for a few seconds. The head dies quickly, leaving some islands.
Smell is a very distinct dark roasted coffee, which covers up some of the unique bourbon smell associated with the standard BCS, although it is still there. Dark chocolate present of course, as well as some cherries. Vanilla especially present after some warming.
Taste is perfect. First comes the bourbon, followed quickly by the espresso on the back of the tongue and through the nose. Some sweetness, almost molasses-like, but not cloying at all. Slightly woody. Alcohol is present, but hard to believe it is at 13%, and not off-putting at all. Extremely full of flavor and difficult to pick out everything. As it warms, some of the bitterness dies off and the sweetness kicks up.
Mouthfeel is thick and coats the mouth easily. Hits the back of the throat like a melted chocolate milk shake.
Of course the beer is strong and physically limits how much one can drink, but for the style, the drinkability is great and I could drink it for as long as I could afford it. The flavor and thickness doesn't detract from the drinkability. I could drink more than a bomber myself and enjoy every sip of it as much as the first. 1,683 charactersAuztan, Apr 23, 2010
4.42/5  rDev -3.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Pours black, opaque, with a small tan head, which dies quickly.
Scent of sweet bourbon, chocolate, maple syrup, vanilla, dark fruit, caramel, roasted malts, fresh bitter coffee, and a touch of alcohol on the end. The bitterness of the coffee balances the sweetness nicely in the complex beast of a scent.
Taste of roasted malts, maple syrup, bourbon, molasses, dry charred oak, bitter coffee, and finishes with a nice warming alcohol. Finishes with bitter coffee and alcohol. Different enough from the base beer, and still damn good.
Mouthfeel is heavy, smooth and syrupy, fantastic. 586 characterspaco1029384756, Apr 23, 2010
4.82/5  rDev +5.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.752011 Release - Intelligentsia Anjilanaka Beans
In comparison to last year's version, the Anjilanaka provides a sweeter and nuttier component that takes off the more aggressive elements of roast and dryness. Succulent as ever and still with impressions of chocolate covered espresso beans, this world class beer follows up on the inaugural beer very well. Although I prefer the heightened sense of espresso roast and restrained sweetness of last year, this young follow-up represents the brand in regal fashion! 
2010 Release - Intelligentsia Black Cat Espresso Beans 
With so much anticipation, and with the success of the standard Bourbon County Brand Stout, there is no let down from the hype. This coffee infused BCS reminds me of chocolate covered espresso beans and the bourbon ball candies that we love so much here in the Bluegrass. Imagine my favorite espresso and my favorite stout hooked up at a great beery coffee shop and conceived an angelic brew.
The beer opens with a dead-on motor oil viscosity and color. A delicate crème forms with a roast-stained hue. Where the retention eventually succumbes to the alcohol and weight, the legging became more apparent. The low carbonation and visual weight of the beer adds to the mystique of its appearance.
Extremely seductive aromas of decedent cocoa, deeply roasted espresso, and bourbon all stand out in obvious stature. Lighter notes of cherry esters, licorice, and actual molasses help to round out the background attributes. The beer's aroma isn't overly complex but they show so much power, boldness, and harmony- this is the chick in the bar that you will intently make a fool of yourself just to catch her eye.
Flavors build even more, springboarding off of the powerful cocoa, espresso, and bourbon. But the thickness of the beer along with the creamy maltytness give even greater smoothness and melded taste making this beer way more drinkable than it should be; kinda malty-sweet-chocolatey like Whoppers malted milk candies. As the beer warms and deep in the finish, the molasses, licorice, and cherry flavors become much more apparant. Where hops are restrained, bitterness is achieved with the smooth bitterness of the carefully brewed espresso beans.
As expected, the beer is as thick, chewy, heavy, full, and as round as any beer that has crept into my mouth. And with the ultimate velvety textures, it drank much like a thick chocolate milkshake. The beer remains so very deep, lasting well into the finish and aftertaste.
It's crazy to talk that the coffee bean aging could possibly improve the Bourbon County Stout. I'm not sure that the Coffee Release is better but it's certainly not any worse. 2,681 charactersBEERchitect, Apr 22, 2010
