4.81/5  rDev +4.6%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.752017 batch.
Appearance: dark and thick. Syrupy-looking.
Smell: This was very impressive. Smells like a bourbon-soaked fudge brownie at first. Some dark fruit and alcohol came through as it warmed. Not as charred-oaky as BCBS, but sweeter/fudgy. Very much enjoyed the aroma on this.
Taste: As it was cold, it tasted very similar to the aroma, and as it warmed, again, the dark fruit started to come out more. Very good.
Overall: This a world class beer and I wish that it was available more often during the year. 512 charactersraspy22, May 21, 2017

Look - thick dark chocolate, creamy but not a ton of lacing, dark tan head but pretty thin and doesnt last long
Smell - oak, bourbon, fudge.  All of it stands out and is nice and bold.
Taste - definitely changes as it warms.  Oak is huge and amazing...as it the bourbon and SWEET dark chocolate.  There's some more going on here with some cocoa, caramel, and maybe a hint of dark fruits.  Best at cellar temperature, not fully warmed, but this is bold and amazing.
Feel - smooth, creamy, no heat, super drinkable.
Overall - Illinois guy here confirming this is not a "hypetrain".  This is an amazing beer and I am so glad I got a 4 pack this year.  Worthy of the reviews. 708 charactersrabbott2, May 12, 2017
5/5  rDev +8.7%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Pours black, like a tricked out minivan’s rear windows.  Nice khaki head with good lacing.  Aroma is dark chocolate, bourbon, and vanilla.  Good oakiness, sorta makes me think of an acorn sitting on a bean bag(a little nut on a comfy pillow).  Taste is very rich.  Lots of chocolate with good bourbon complements.  Vanilla, caramel, and oak, and cocoa powder.  Smooth on the tongue with moderate carbonation.  Rich and thick mouth feel.  This is an outstanding beer. It will stalk you like a raptor and steal your soul. 521 charactersDustyF, May 10, 2017

12oz can poured into a snifter
A- pours pitch black in color with a thin foamy tan head that disappears almost immediately 
S- nice mix of dark roasted malt and bourbon barrel up front. The mix gives aromas reminiscent of nutty fudge brownies, chocolate, molasses, brown sugar, black licorice, spicy oak, bourbon & vanilla
T- Big mix of bourbon and malty sweetness up front, with notes of caramel, chocolate & vanilla.  Bourbon adds some spiciness before giving way to some nutty notes, more bourbon mid-palate, some sweet dark fruit on the finish, the linger gives off notes of dark roast coffee and toasted nuts
M- medium body with low carbonation leads to a slightly foamy mouthfeel and finish, abv is hidden well
O- one of the more drinkable BA stouts I've had as it hides the abv throughout. However, I was looking for more complexity in the flavor. Very good, but don't agree with the hype on this one 925 charactersTreyliff, Nov 07, 2016

This beer pours pitch black with a small, late forming dark mocha head. It does not stick around for long and leaves no lacing.
Smell is the highlight of this beer. Bourbon, vanilla, sweet dark fruits, chocolate and a bit of coffee.
Taste is similar, but the flavors seemed to meld together better in the smell. The coffee comes through a little stonger and bitter and it doesn't compliment the sweetness of the other flavors. A hint of heat on the back end.
Feel is medium and velvety smooth. Hard to call a big beer like this creamy, but it is close. Very little carbonation.
Overall a great beer. Bonus points for the 12oz packaging. Amazingly drinkable for a >10% BA stout. 746 charactersCNoj012, Oct 19, 2016

4.47/5  rDev -2.8%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Black and clear brown on the edges.  No head on the pour and a very marginal amount on the edges.  Excellent lacing on a swirl and a sip, it remains long after.
Nose is Bourbon, chocolate, molasses, booze, a hint of black coffee, a bit of smoke, and dark fruit.
Flavor is sweet dark fruit, bourbon, oak, mild vanilla, malt and a black coffee finish.
Mouthful is medium and smooth in the front end but a bit jagged on the back.  Carbonation is average to low.  Finish is dry and lingers.
After a long drawn out affair of pursuing this beer, I finally have had the opportunity to try it.  It is Bourbon forward, malty backbone, coffee undertone, and a nice fruit aspect.  The nose and mouth are nice.  It definitely opens up as it warms.  For me the biggest drawback was the mouthful - it was surprisingly a bit rough and thin on the backside.  Aside from that note, seek it out, enjoy it, and savor it. 905 charactersSlack, Sep 17, 2016

Smells of bourbon, roasted malt, bittersweet cocoa, vanilla, and sweet lactose. The taste follows exactly with bourbon, roasted malt, cocoa, vanilla, and lactose; strong intensity and good combination of bourbon and roasted flavors.  Medium bitterness/dryness with some light sweetness.  The alcohol is completely masked. Rich mouthfeel and low carbonation.  Overall, this has great flavor intensity and balance without being a bourbon bomb.  Very well done. 534 charactersalarmclock314, Sep 11, 2016

Feel: medium body super creamy soft mouthfeel. Probably the creamiest mouthfeel I've ever had in a stout.
Overall: I'm really impressed with this beer! It's awesome! I wish the beer was more thick and chewy but It makes up for that with the soft creaminess you get in the mouthfeel.All the flavors blend together beautifully in this beer and the brownie flavor Pushes this beer over the top!

Smells of bourbon and roasted malts. Tastes are well balanced with dark fruits, bourbon barrel, dark chocolate, an underlying roast flavor and a touch of alcohol. Not the thickest mouthfeel, but appropriate for the style still. Starts smooth and creamy and coats the mouth after each sip. Overall, a great BA stout that would stand up to many classic examples of the style. 456 charactersOleDixie, Jul 04, 2016

I must admit this wasn't on my radar and I hadn't heard about it.  O thought it was just a regular stout but once I poured it, it looked and smelled like a bba stout.  And lo and behold, IT IS A BBA Stout!  Haven't seen many beers of this nature canned,  but it works, very glad to get to try out, it's a great beer.  2015 vintage 399 characterstroupos40, Jun 18, 2016

Bourbon county is a little bit better in the mouthfeel department though as far as thickness goes. For the most part this barrel aged stout is very smooth and easy to drink just not as hefty as bourbon county. Bonus points go to this Arkansas brewery for putting this in 12oz cans; I feel like this is a great format for a barrel aged stout. Very impressed. Honestly, I think that I have found a permanent replacement for bourbon county. 529 characters4DAloveofSTOUT, May 20, 2016

Pours a dark black body, chocolate brown hue, one finger brown head, good retention, no lacing, thin collar. Smells of massive dark chocolate, bourbon, smoke, roast, milk chocolate, nuttiness. Flavour is even better, with tons of bourbon, nuttiness, bitter dark chocolate intermixed with sweet milk chocolate, roast, even a bit of vanilla. Zero heat, so much flavour behind this, it's wonderful. Mouthfeel is full bodied, creamy, good carbonation, smooth with tons of chocolate and no heat. Damn good stout. 565 charactersStevedore, May 02, 2016

The smell is a slight disappointment at first, as was mentioned in another review below - there is a little bit of a metallic aroma int he nose and in the first sip.... After the first sip and a couple minutes in the glass to let it warm up - it is fantastic.  Best way to describe it is - bourbon soaked fudge brownies in liquid form.  The mouthfeel is on point, maybe not super thick, but very smooth and delicate with flavor.  The beer just coats the mouth and you hardly have to swallow - it just melts in your mouth. So damn smooth and well crafted, there is little-to-no alcohol feel, pretty awesome... wish I had a case of these cans.. anyone want to trade me more!?!? 765 charactersM_chav, Apr 22, 2016

4.59/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Pours pitch black with a finger of dark khaki/light mocha head that slowly recedes to a thin film and collar that leaves some lacing on the glass.
The aroma is both sweet and smokey. Caramelized dark fruits, namely prunes, and dates are in the forefront. This is followed by smokey charred wood, toffee, light vanilla, and hints of chocolate covered cherries. Absolutely bursting with character and complexity!
The flavor is more of those sweet, dark fruits, but balanced by nice warming alcohol, hints of smoke, and some roasty coffee notes. Vanilla and charred oak also play, and some sweet lactose sugar can be noticed in the middle of the palate.
Nice thickness, super smooth, light but distinct carbonation, creamy, nice barrel character, noticeable but tame boozy bite and warmth. Fantastic!
This is the real deal! An absolutely fantastic barrel aged imperial stout! I'll be happy to get some more of this in my cellar, and would love to see how it ages! 964 charactersSadMachine, Apr 19, 2016

Look - Nearly as black as night. Not much head. 
Smell - Light bourbon, chocolate, roasted malts...some vanilla and coffee but very subtle. 
Taste - This is where the beer really shines. Abv is well hidden by the smooth chocolate and bourbon.  Everything about the taste is perfect and no one characteristic overwhelms the others. 
Feel - I like thick stouts and this isn't that. It's not watery (no where close) but it's also not a thick fudge-like stout. 
Overall - I love this beer. Very decadent and smooth.  If it could be a tad thicker, I'd have one every night. 742 characterstaplebr, Apr 17, 2016
4.47/5  rDev -2.8%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.52016 edition; one of the blackest pours I have ever seen, with barely any head. The nose is rich brownie, as is the flavor, with only a minor note of ABV heat. My only complaint is that it's too thin -- once you've had a BA brownie batter beer that's chewy and thick, nothing else is as pleasing. Otherwise, this is brilliant.
EDIT/ADD: 2017 - every bit as good as the '16, with more barrel notes. 398 charactersIMFletcher, Apr 17, 2016

When you don't want a gigantic BBA stout like Black Tuesday, this is the perfect balance of flavor and everything. The booze is nearly non-existent on the nose and body, compared to other examples of the style. This edges out BCBS for me. The people of Arkansas need not seek out any Bourbon County, when something like this is readily available. Looking forward to seeing what else comes out of this brewery. 483 charactersshaemmerle, Apr 16, 2016

A nice bourbon that doesn't overwhelm. Bourbon and a darker chocolate. Good bittersweet. Like a bourbon soaked chocolate chip. Smooth and creamy but a touch thinner than I'd like. Still a great beer. 287 charactersHootie159, Mar 25, 2016

Both excellent but for different reasons.  2016 was a little thinner and a little sweeter but nice Bourbon notes and a nice vanilla finish.  2015 was a LOT thicker and had a ton more mouthfeel.  Better bourbon notes and tons of chocolate but no vanilla finish 346 charactersYodersBeerEmporium, Mar 20, 2016

4.95/5  rDev +7.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5Pours black and a bit shiny.  Small dark khaki head is slow to form and but quite dense once it does.  Doesn't last terribly long but lots of lacing left behind.  Lacing is spiderweb like and very sticky.
Big bourbon aroma.  Oak and vanilla barrel notes.  Chocolate, extremely fudge-y.  Caramel and molasses.  Cocoa powder.  Raw roasted malt and licorice.
I get the chocolate and vanilla first.  Milk chocolate, fudge, and cocoa powder.  Based on the aroma, I expected the bourbon to be the dominate flavor.  Instead, it's more a strong complement, noticeable and ever-present but not overwhelming.  Cream and caramel.  In the running for the best flavor of any beer I've had.
Smooth, creamy mouth feel.  Medium bodied with moderate carbonation.  Sweet, luscious. and rich.  Chocolate lingers, dark but sweet.
A truly special beer.  Like putting a piece of fudge and chocolate milk in a blender and then adding a shot of bourbon. 933 charactersleroybrown10, Mar 19, 2016

S: Mocha, dark cocoa, and fresh chocolate chip cookies
T: Honestly this was like drinking straight boozy chocolate milk - phenomenal flavor profile. However, the sweetness is swiftly met by a mildly bitter coffee and vanilla lightness and very subtle bourbon notes - the heat is artfully subdued however
F: Thick, luscious, and creamy mouthfeel that's on par with BCBS in my opinion
O: This is a decadent and engaging stout from the first sip. Given the low number of ratings, at this point, for this highly regarded stout I had my suspicions, but for me this beer delivered in full. The ABV is well masked and the heat from the bourbon barrels is well integrated and not cloying in the way some BA stouts can be that are drank 'too young'. Overall I thoroughly enjoyed this one - a great BA stout that stands out in a very crowded field. 928 charactersFireman_RK, Mar 05, 2016

I had both the BDCS 16 and the Onyx Coffee version, and both are just damn amazing. Midnight black color, with a small retaining creamy-brown head. Smells like a chocolate chip cookie, with a hint of vanilla-like alcohol. The taste is sweet dark chocolate and bourbon. The alcohol is present, but is very smooth for a 10.1 beer, and adds to the flavor quite a bit. This thing is creamy and delicious, with a slight roastiness to end things right. Thick and creamy mouthfeel. Can't say enough good things about this beer. As close to perfect as it gets. 703 charactersKdubzz, Feb 28, 2016
4.99/5  rDev +8.5%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Enjoyed both from the tap and in a can on 2/27/16.  Was able to taste both 2015 and 2016 at the same time along with their coffee version, which is not listed at this time.  Pours black as night with minimal head that disappears quickly.  Can smell the bourbon and a bit of the wood.  Taste and mouthfeel are on par with Bourbon County(which is understandable if you do a little homework on the brewer), which is a beer that is near and dear to my heart.  Just imagine Bourbon County in a can, and that is what you get here.  I cannot wait to taste the two side by side. 570 charactersgibgink, Feb 28, 2016

A bit of roast, maybe too much. Lighter bodied which is a complaint of mine. Chocolate and cocoa with bourbon and vanilla. It's like bcs meets dragon milk. 
Body needs to be thicker. Less roast would also be nice. Otherwise decent. 259 charactersmothman, Feb 28, 2016

4.99/5  rDev +8.5%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A beautiful chocolate brown head reaches an inch before it fades to a skim.  Body jet black like used motor oil.  Nose is just gorgeous with tones of bourbon, Carmel, toffee and dark over ripe fruits.  With first sip I just have to say holly #!?&.  The flavor of this beer is nothing short of incredible.  Bourbon, toffee, carmel, dark fruit  and dark chocolate all dance a symphony on the tongue.  Creamy and dark with beautiful balance. I can find no flaw in the flavor of this beer.  Really just a perfect brew. I can't believe this one has not been rated more. I really don't mean to start the hype train on this one, but when a beer jumps into my top rated brews, it is pretty damn impressive.  This was served from a freshly filled can. 742 charactersSPLITGRIN, Jul 25, 2015

5/5  rDev +8.7%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured from the can into a Prairie tulip.
Appearance - Pours black as night with a little bit of moonlight on top.
Aroma - As it warms, the aroma becomes more pronounced, but the barrel presence doesn't overwhelm the beer.
Palate - The base imperial version of their cream stout would be a fantastic beer on its own merits. The barrel has only improved upon this by imparting hints of vanilla and peppery spices. Most barrel aged beers are much too alcohol forward and somewhat of a chore to drink. BDCS strikes the balance of having a barrel presence, but as a compliment to the beer and not a substitute.
Texture - Velvety smooth and nuanced. Not too thick, but with a subtle complexity to the texture.
Overall - It would be unfair to compare BDCS to beers such as KBS or BOMB!. There is no added coffee or adjunct flavors in BDCS, even though you get a hint of coffee in the taste. An appropriate comparison would be to Bourbon County Brand Stout and BDCS is a superior beer in every aspect.
Edit: After having many highly rated BA Stouts during this past year, this is simply the best. The brewer truly needs to release the non-BA version of this. 1,157 charactersKevin67, Jun 16, 2015

Smooth and rich on the front end with a VERY strong bourbon finish. For such a small brewery in NW Arkansas, this is a grand slam beer. 209 characterssenglish7, Jun 10, 2015

Nice barrel characteristic. Very nice flavors, a little booze a little vanilla.  Nice nose.
Wish this beer would've had some head retention or lacing.

S : Like a boozy chocolate milk. Lots of heavy cream, a bit of chocolate, pepper and vanilla. 
T: Very nice. There's all that cream and vanilla, and just a hint of the spice/cinnamon/pepper from the barrel. 
F: Thinner than I'd have liked from the style but nice and velvety. Seriously it tastes like having a coffee but without the bitterness. 
O: I would definitely stock up on this. Just got 2 4 packs but regret not getting a case. I hope they can the coffee version as well. 557 characterssteve032, Mar 24, 2015

Forcing myself to find a negative, the aroma didn’t quite ’pop’ for me. But, again, that is nit-picking. This is an incredible offering. 349 charactersARaces23, Mar 23, 2015
