A: Small dark chocokate head that disappears to a small ring. Body is pitch black as befitting a big stout.
S: light sugary coffee smell, tons of chocolate, light nuttiness, dark licorice, a lingering umami finish.
T: Lots of nice sweet roasted coffee, followed by a thick chocolate, a light soy sauce finish really coats and clings to the tongue.
M: Slick oily and tongue drippingly thick. This beer is chewy and slick it just coats and clings. 
O: This beer is fantastic if you like big rich chewy thick stouts with while not overwhelming coffee quite a nice supporting role. The mouthfeel on this beer is perfect, its so lush and full. If you like your stouts huge tasting with just a little umami you will love this beer. 767 charactersSomethingClever, Jan 26, 2017

4.73/5  rDev +4.6%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Apart from Founder's Breakfast Stout and a couple other outliers, I would wager that Cigar City is the overall master of  coffee beer. The Cubano Espresso is an excellent coffee brown ale, the Cafe con Leche is basically coffee Haagen Dazs in a bottle. But this one is the heaviest and the best of them all. I tasted it blind, and I guessed the ABV to be around 6%, it's so smooth that the high alcohol is totally covered up. Perfect amount of sweetness, pitch black with a dark brown head. Tastes just like a velvety sweet espresso, and living in Florida I've had the Buddy Brew coffee on which this is based... top-notch coffee that flavors a top-notch stout. For my money it's the best of their strong stouts beating even Marshal Zhukov. Well except for Hunahpu obviously... nothing is better than Hunahpu. 809 charactersjaketaz, Nov 12, 2016

Appearance: Pours out a viscous, motor oil-esque body, black, though with no real head formation.
Smell: A roasty-toned aroma with chunks of bittersweet chocolate pitted with notes of prune juice, oozing molasses and a couple drops of soy.
Taste: Starts with dark chocolate sauce, then that molasses, a sliver of booze and bitter coffee flavors amidst ashen roast. Dark fruitiness. As with the aroma, a bit of soy. Sweet, roasty finish certainly with some warming qualities.
Mouthfeel: Medium-full body. Medium-low carbonation. Sticky mouthfeel.
Overall: Not to be missed? Well, it's fine. A beer which is just fine. 696 charactersChainGangGuy, Oct 29, 2016

S- smells of a delicious medley of chocolate milk and espresso; opens with fresh espresso, followed by aromas of vanilla cream, milk chocolate, cocoa, caramel, mocha & some earthy notes to close it out 
T- rich earthy/herbal espresso up front is immediately followed by notes of mocha, vanilla whipping cream, dark chocolate & toasted walnuts.  As it nears the finish, flavors of kahluha, toffee and marshmallow sweetness carry into a linger of espresso and fig 
M- thick and viscous body with moderate carbonation leads to a rich and creamy mouthfeel that finishes velvety smooth with more creaminess on the linger
O- amazing rich espresso intermingles with chocolate and vanilla throughout, with virtually perfect thick and creamy mouthfeel that hides the alcohol almost perfectly.  A treat to be savored 1,011 charactersTreyliff, Oct 19, 2016

Rich, thick coffee aroma.  Espresso and sweetened coffee.  Dark chocolate, caramel, and molasses.  
Like the aroma, taste is heavy, dark coffee, less sweet to start.  Chocolate is dark and very bitter.  Sweetness comes through as a subtle complement.  Caramel and cream.  Hint of vanilla.  Big roasty malt on the back end.
Thick body with moderate carbonation.  Rich, creamy, and intense.  Coffee and chocolate bitterness but still smooth on the tongue.  Luscious.
Fantastic coffee stout.  Big flavors and a mouth feel that is matched by few beers I've had in the past. 660 charactersleroybrown10, Aug 14, 2016

4.23/5  rDev -6.4%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Smoothy, roasty, decadent and drinkable, the marvel that Cigar City conjured up is a taste that's equally as welcomed in the coffee house as it is in the brew house.
Caffe Americano pours as much like espresso as it does of stout, layering the glass with viscous espresso roast and then capping with a dainty, swirling mocha creme. With coffee, cream and toffee luring the nose, its taste is succulent with caramel, chocolate and cream.
With the sweetness seeping into the tastebuds, the vanilla, caramel, milk and soft roast swirling about the palate, its sultry coffeehouse taste takes hold. Like macchiato, the beer's latte flavors mingle with roast, kaluha, walnut, chocolate and maple maltiness for a bittersweet finish of marshmallow, butterscotch and creme de cacao.
Milder than snakebite liquor, the beer's full but somber body carries a light carbonation to keep the taste creamy and silky. Playing on the tongue like velvet, the soft and bitter char provides a late earthen balance to the sweetness as both the coffee and malt fade into a mellow and soothing finish of milkshake and columbian blends of coffee. 1,123 charactersBEERchitect, Aug 08, 2016

Produces a couple fingers of dark brown head that settles down but leaves a decent layer of head and a full sheet of lacing. The beer is so thick it actually coats the glass; this is my kind of stout!
Smells is tons of espresso. A little leathery and earthy, but really just a lot of coffee.
Taste is espresso, chocolate and some more of the earthy flavors. Its sweet, but definitely well balanced with the bitter notes of the coffee or maybe dark chocolate. 
Feel is full bodied, oily and sticky. 
Overall, the Caffe Americano holds up to its lofty ratings. Its got everything I look for in terms of body and taste, and tremendous balance for a beer with so much going on. A++ 729 charactersGreatStoutman, Aug 04, 2016

Aroma has plenty of espresso as the label suggests, equal amount of tabacco and sweet jerky. Plenty of sweet roasted malt in the background.
Taste is not as coffee foward as I expected, rather a complex chocolate like fudge profile with a big almond nuttiness in the back end. Big tabacco leaf, licorice, and sweet roasted malt in there as well. 
Mouthfeel is very thick and palate coating. Overall, a very big beer. Very sweet, nutty, thick, and complex. 595 charactersMateo2699, Aug 02, 2016

Decadently roasted malt aromas come blasting off, with molasses, prune, savory roasted and spiced nuts, and jerky. With all this complexity, the chocolate and coffee actually come in late on the back end.
Taste is crazy rich, with an almost overwhelming, yet enticing roastiness and tang. Bittersweet chocolate and coffee is paired with molasses, vanilla, and a complex nuttiness.
Caffe Americano is surprisingly nice and dry despite the otherwise luscious flavor and feel. I thought Cubano Espresso was good, but wow if I had had this first I'm not sure I'd ever seek the other out again. 696 charactersSabtos, Jul 24, 2016

  Smells of a huge, dark roast coffee, with Dark chocolate malts.  Molasses and Carmel smell sneaks in.
The taste on this is amazing.  The coffee taste is up there with the best I've ever had.  Definitely a dark roast.  The first thing that jumped into my mind was a fresh, local sugar cone taste.  Hops are also present and very much enjoyed.  A wonderful blend of chocolate malt, Carmel and vanilla, with the slightest touch of licorice.  This comes together so wonderfully well.
The finish continues the complexity in this one.  A little burn on the way down from the hops, and my soul is smiling for 30 seconds after every sip.  I rate this with the big bourbon barrel beers of Bourbon County, and Avery without the bourbon.  Why oh why didn't I buy more when I was on vacation. 840 charactersGobearswalter34, Jun 17, 2016

4.27/5  rDev -5.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25I have to agree with another reviewer that Caffe Americano has many similar traits to Hunaphu without the chile heat and cinnamon. It has a very similar very dark brown color with a thin tan foam head. It smells of espresso and tastes of rich coffee and chocolate and has a little burn from the alcohol (similar to Hunahpu) but has even more coffee flavor, hence the name. What it's missing is that great combination of cinnamon, chile heat, vanilla, coffee, chocolate and vanilla. Still a very good stout on it's own that really opens up with rich chocolate as it warms, but in my mind it lives in the shadow of its big brother. Still, well worth seeking out. 660 charactersELS, Jun 12, 2016

T: oh yeah! Big coffee without the bitterness I got in the aroma. There is a very slight vanilla, and a slight bitterness to it as I drink more.  
F: very thick right away. Smooth, a stick to your teeth syrup thickness.  Very nice.
O: a great coffee stout. This goes toe to toe with sump and would love to do fresh bottles of each side by side. But sump gets my vote, this has a slight bitterness that sump doesn't. 584 charactersyesterdayfaraway, Jun 10, 2016

O-tremendous offering and a standout DLD pour for sure.  took my time with this to let it warm, and it really just balances all the sweet flavors with coffee perfectly.  Will seek out again 675 charactersrabbott2, May 02, 2016

Rich world class nose loaded with vanilla and caramel over a base of espresso, cocoa and amazingly light roast (considering the color).
Solid medium body that is so smooth it approaches creamy.  World class carbonation / body balance that allows the complex flavors to shine.  There is a nice effervescent middle and a finish that is prickly.
The flavor profile is world class with a kicker.  It is richly flavored, complex and in perfect balance.  It begins with a moderately bitter grainy aspect of roast and espresso that quickly becomes sweet.  Caramel, chocolate and vanilla explode on the pallet, then slowly fade into chocolate / cocoa over a softly bittered middle.  Here espresso takes the lead as sweetness fades and becomes more like dark bakers chocolate.  Light alcohol becomes evident during the finish, but rich flavors subdue any dryness.  For an 11% ABV, this is quite an accomplishment.  The finish is a slow fade of slightly bitter dark chocolate and espresso and subtle notes of vanilla.  One of the best stout I've ever had.  As it warms, caramel also emerges in the finish adding sweetness to the complex delicious finish. 1,258 characterstillmac62, Apr 11, 2016

Pours a pitch black body with a deep brown one finger head that reduces fairly quickly to leave a ring of retention and little lacing. Really liked the thick pour and dark head. 
Aromas are a little muted, vanilla, coffee and cocoa come through. 
Aromas become irrelevant upon taking the first sip.. wow, this is absolutely stunning. Vanilla bean, dark roast coffee, cocoa all meld together to create a super tasty combination of flavors. Finish is roasty and sip demanding. Thick, chewy mouthfeel with low carbonation.
Rich, balanced, complex, and flavorful stout. Recommended! 657 charactersgcamparone, Apr 10, 2016

Pours a thick, oily dark black body, one finger mocha head with good retention. Not much lacing, but does leave a thin collar and oily film. Smells of intense bitter cocoa, black coffee, milk chocolate, plenty of roasted coffee bean, surprising for a beer that's 9 months old. However, the cocoa and coffee are to the point that it almost gets overwhelming. Flavour is more balanced, with plenty of espresso bitterness, dark and milk chocolate both, roast, and a mild touch of vanilla bean astringency that nevertheless changes it up. It's definitely a coffee-forward brew despite the vanilla. Mouthfeel is full bodied, substantial, good carbonation. I swear Cigar City likes to put in motor oil into their stouts which remain some of the thickest stouts I've ever drank. Overall, a good stout with a ton of coffee and cocoa. They don't mess around with their stouts. 938 charactersStevedore, Feb 27, 2016

Smells like dark rich coffee with some chocolate and vanilla in the back ground.
Taste is very very coffee forward with some chocolatey sweetness coming through mid palate, finishing back with coffee bitterness.
Mouthfeel is pretty thick and coating without overdoing it. Goes down smooth and leaves you wanting another sip.
Overall outstanding beer, but is a little overdone on the coffee if you don't love coffee stouts don't seek this out you'll be very dissapointed as that is definitely the main flavor, but I definitely recommend seeking this out once. It is up there with speedway as my favorite stout absolutely incredible beer. 699 charactersScott17Taylor, Jan 20, 2016

This one smells like rich bitter roasty coffe, roasted malt, vanilla cream, and dark chocolate.
This is an undeniably delicious stout, and another sterling example of Cigar City's mastery of stouts. The coffee flavor is quite in your face and awesome, pretty bitter but roasty and wonderful. It's very complementary to the sweet vanilla cream, a little bit of caramel, and delicious dark chocolate. Through all of that, you're reminded that is a stout with some wonderful roasted malt character.
This is pretty thick bodied, with a very creamy mouthfeel, super super rich. 
One of the best coffee stouts that you can get your hands on. Highly recommended. 766 charactersGreesyFizeek, Jan 16, 2016
4.58/5  rDev +1.3%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5This beer is a beautiful, thick, dark black, viscous, velvety, decadent liquid with a light tan head at the finish.  Coffee aroma, malts and dark chocolate waft from the glass.  Beautiful to look at and so aromatic.  Ah aromatic cafe'. The initial bitterness can be off putting to some as the roasted barley and expresso coffee seem overly intense on the palate.  Let the beer warm a little.  Don’t go off the initial taste as it smacks the palate.  Subsequent tastings of this outstanding coffee stout leave you to think that you are drinking a BA stout.  I checked the label and shook my head.  Wow this stout has a flavor profile that is pronounced.  I don’t know if other brewers are using cheap coffee but the expresso in this is strong, flavorful and tasty.  I have read this beer described as velvety – yes velvety dark chocolate with a roasted expresso bitterness on my palate and on the finish.  If you like stouts you will just like everything about this beer.  If you are a coffee stout person then this may be it – the pinnacle, Plato's ideal. 1,063 charactersAlequine, Jan 16, 2016

Flavor is deep decadent chocolate with a good amount of espresso, and coffee. The vanilla, caramel and coca give it a pleasant sweeter balance.So complex and so well blended together. It's all there and I can't imagine a better tasting coffee beer.Smooth, rich, velvety and decadent.

Smell - lots and lots of coffee.
Taste - lot of roasted coffee, but with some chocolate and cocoa present as well.
Feel - very smooth.  No taste of booziness whatsoever despite double digit abv.
Overall - an excellent coffee stout that hits all the right notes if you enjoy coffee flavor in your beer.  Highly recommended for those. 413 characterseifster82, Dec 08, 2015

A- Pours a fully opaque black color with a 1/2 inch dark brown head that retains decently before becoming a thick ring around the edge of the glass and a half sheet of swirly surface foam.  Semi-resilient lacing leaves tiny specs behind.
S- Rich, decadent mocha aroma with notes of dark chocolate, caramel and treacle.
T- Excellent coffee/chocolate profile.  Milk chocolate and caramel leads the way with the bitterness of the dark roast coffee coming in mid-palate and in the finish.  So good.  The alcohol is also insanely well hidden.
M- Creamy with medium-low carbonation and a full body.
O- CCB knows their way around some coffee in their beers.  This one has remarkable balance between the sweetness of the chocolate and the roastiness of the coffee.  Highly recommended. 873 charactersImmortale25, Dec 02, 2015

Smells as expected. Dark chocolate, roasted malt and coffee.
Taste is fantastic. Big time dark chocolate with a really smooth, subtle coffee bitterness. I sometimes find coffee stout to be entirely too overwhelming with the coffee, or for the coffee itself to just come across as slightly burnt and acidic but not this gem.
Exceptionally smooth, with a viscous mouthfeel. Really, really creamy. And the alcohol is well hidden.
This exceeded my expectations. Probably the best non barrel aged coffee stout I've experienced. Extremely well done. 585 charactersZaximus, Nov 15, 2015

Luckily, I was able to score a glass of it during the Cigar City takeover at Three Floyds in the fall of 2015, because the Blackhawks had defeated the Lightning in the Stanley Cup. A great coffee stout, but I do prefer Bourbon County more. Had a bottle of it in March of 2016 and it was very bitter from strong dark chocolate and expresso. Also tasted somewhat smoked and ashy. Definitely a sipping beer. 439 charactersTrevor11, Nov 05, 2015

Smell - Wow. The nose is big time expresso.  This could give me the shakes. 
Taste – Hello, Expresso. Thick rich expresso is accompanied by hints of vanilla. This would be so good with cake or various other deserts. The coffee lingers in the aftertaste, becoming slightly more bitter.  
Mouthfeel – The sweetness really clings to the tongue with low carbonation. 
Overall – This is easily one of the best coffee bears I have had. 533 charactersJohnnyHopps, Nov 05, 2015

5/5  rDev +10.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This is the best coffee beer I've had all year!
Pours black with a caramel color head. Notes of coffee, roast, and sweetness on the nose. The taste at first was pinch of sweetness followed by a strong espresso flavor. More robust than most coffee beers I've had this year. Its rounded out with chocolate and a mouthfeel made it seem like creamer was present. As it warmed up tho, you could really start to smell the vanilla and it gradually made its way to the forefront of the beer. I;m not sure if this was due the warm of the beer or my palette getting use to the flavor. My friend picked up on the vanilla right away but for me it took almost half the beer and the warmth.
CCB is really killing it with this year's batch. 727 charactersultimaterager, Oct 29, 2015

The taste is coffee, perhaps a lot of coffee, but not tons of coffee (compared to BCBCS or Bell's 30th for example). There is also some bitterness, but again, quite subdued for what my friend described as a "coffee bomb." Mouthfeel is creamy and slick but not sticky. Really, really good. Wish I could try the BA versions. 406 characters_RL_, Oct 28, 2015

Pours jet black and extremely viscous with a very slim tan head that quickly disappeared. Heavy coffee nose as well as taste. Vanilla beans quickly take over and linger in mouth. Very creaminess taste of roasted goodness. Overall a very tasty beer that I'm happy I was able to try. 341 charactersCorson, Sep 06, 2015

The taste is a creamy roastiness, if that makes sense.  Not a lot of coffee/espresso, just a hearty/roasty big stout.  Finish is fairly smooth but some roasted bite (maybe that's the coffee).  Overall a pretty good beer. 329 charactersmrn1ceguy, Sep 01, 2015

4.9/5  rDev +8.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Cigar City - Caffè Americano. Double Stout brewed with coffee, cacao nibs and vanilla beans. Rated 99/100 on BeerAdvocate (11%) brewed in Tampa, Florida.
"Traditional Caffè Americano is made by adding water to espresso. We break all the rules with this Double Stout. We refuse to add water to our beer after fermentation, but have no issues adding beer to our espresso. This deep, dark stout exhibits rich espresso and coffee notes, which are contributed by the generous use of roasted barley and espresso locally roasted by Buddy Brew Coffee. That simply is not enough for us. We also add roasted, raw chocolate and a hint of vanilla to this big bodied stout. Dodge the red eye and take a shot of the dark."
This is going to be a treat. A beer without water, but coffee added with locally sourced coffee, chocolate , and vanilla. Can you say diabetes? This is probably going to be one epic review. 
Pour: One of the darkest beers I have ever seen in my life. Darker than Marshal Zhukov and Imperial Biscotti Break. This beer poured motor oil black, with a nice brownie dark chocolate head, which is easily the darkest head I have came across yet. The lacing on this beer sticks like melted chocolate in a bowl; sticky with a nice even coated ring around the whole glass. This beer looks so fricken delicious. My favorite types of stouts are the ones with these kind of looks.
Aroma: Am I in Heaven? Or leading myself into a chocolate factory Hell? This is the most well balanced chocolate and coffee forward beer I have smelt. Incredible gobs of chocolate covered coffee beans, espresso, brownies, chocolate syrup, and vanilla. It's a symphony of diabetes, but it's the most beautiful aromatic stout I have had to date. I mean literally, this is chocolate and coffee all the way. I do get a bit of an alcohol aroma as well, but at 11% I was expecting that, and with no water in this beer at all, this is so impressive. Better aromatics than Zhukov at least two fold. Awesome smelling beer!
Taste: My God.. This is the best non barrel aged stout I have ever had. So fricken awesome! Immediately on my mouth I get a super thick and heavy mouthfeel with waves of chocolate, coffee, and vanilla. Then a slight pop of espresso and brownie and sugar. I mean it's literally like sipping on melted down chocolate and some coffee, exactly and maybe some Ben and Jerry's Brownie batter ice cream. This is the thickest stout I have had to date! It's not overly sweet, it's perfectly balanced with coffee and chocolate. Amazing beer.
Verdict: 5/5. If you love coffee and chocolate, please seek this beer out if you can. This is a gem of a beer. I wish breweries would start using only ingredients like coffee instead of water.. It gives beers a higher level of complexity and flavor. The best non-barrel aged stout to date. Cheers! 2,830 characterskeags_beer, Jul 21, 2015

From a bomber into a snifter
Stout with coffee, cacao nibs and vanilla beans added
APPEARANCE: A pitch black, sludgy pour yields a three finger, medium looking, creamy, dark mocha head with great retention. Head slowly fades to a creamy, thick head and leaves some nice lacing down the glass. Pitch black body with no carbonation evident. A slight wisp remains until the end but leaves no real lacing down the glass. This is a menacing, oily brew. 
SMELL: Lots of cocoa, milk chocolate, sweet vanilla cream, coffee, with some roasted notes and butterscotch. Big stout with well balanced adjuncts. Rich and enticing. Can't get any better than this, really. 
TASTE: Cacao nibs and some bitter, roasted, burnt coffee up front. Lots of flavor at the swallow with a big and lingering finish of sweet cream, butterscotch, sweet milk chocolate, vanilla, with roasted flavors and some burnt, bitter espresso. Notes of bitter, dark chocolate mingle with the espresso as well. Great stuff. 
PALATE: Fuller body with medium levels of carbonation. Creamy on the palate, silky smooth, goes down smooth and finishes sticky. A bit of a bite at the swallow with lots of bitter chocolate lingering on the palate. 
OVERALL: Really rich and flavorful. Almost overwhelmingly so, which I would obviously never admit. Lots of lovely flavor and aroma with a look and feel worth paying top price for. Another example of why CCB rules the stout world. Thanks again 7clutch. This was one lovely and inspiring brew. 1,547 charactersJeffo, Jul 04, 2015

A – Black, really black..so black it looks purple. Nice frothy chocolate milk colored head that stayed around and had small amounts of lacing. 
S – Light and sweet cream smell. Reminds me of a milk stout. Chocolate, coffee and vanilla. 
T  - Super  punch of coffee/espresso right off. Very light cream taste to follow. Aroma is much stronger of cream then the taste. Slight bitter bite follows. Not nearly as sweet as the smell again suggests.  Roasted malts in the mix. 
M – Lightly carbonated. Coats the palate with stouty goodness. Thick baby!
O – Delicious. Was worried that this one would be too sweet but not a chance. Its dead on tasty. Catapults into my Top 10. If you like coffee you will love this one. Hot damn! Now to find more… 782 charactersGallowsThief, Jun 30, 2015

4.41/5  rDev -2.4%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25A- Super night black pour to several glasses with a large, thick mocha brown cap. Good retention as a massive sheet of forms around the sides.
S- Very high on the espresso in the aroma with dark roast beans jumping out of the glass. Fudge, vanilla sweets, milk chocolate, roast barley and slight dark fruits.
T- Shifts a bit to the heavy roast both from the grains and the coffee. Roast bitter edge, vanilla beans, espresso, char, medium sweetness, dark fruits and milk chocolate feeling nibs. Fudge truffle.
MF- Massive body pretty much at max thickness. Medium carbonation makes the big body turn creamy and dessert like.
Words run out at some point for these CCB Imperial stouts. Lives up with a very good espresso and chocolate feel; fresher tones than the Rum BA. 772 characterscbutova, Jun 22, 2015

The one thing I didn't like was it felt like the beer couldn't decide between Coffee and Coco. For some reason it just didn't connect right for me. But it was one of the best Imperials I have had.
Wish it wasn't so expensive. But glad I got a few to try. Pick one up if you see it! 325 charactersiTunesUpdates, Jun 11, 2015

4.7/5  rDev +4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75This was on draft at Boxelder during a Cigar City tap takeover event.  Poured into a snifter.
It pours pitch black with a beautiful, brown, one-finger head.  It looks fantastic.  It has a strong coffee aroma, backed up by dark chocolate.  The taste doesn't disappoint, with a perfect balance between the roasty bitterness of the coffee and a chocolaty, malty sweetness.  This is the best coffee beer I've ever had, and one of the best stouts I've tried. 454 charactersshillzor, May 16, 2015

The two finger head is the darkest I've seen and leaves medium amount of lacing. Big chocolate on the nose along with coffee and pipe tobacco. Taste follows the nose with milk and bakers chocolate leading the way. Rich, black espresso on the finish with vanilla throughout. Leaves a strong, bitter, and sweet aftertaste. Huge mouth feel is amazing. Overall this exceeded expectations. One of the best coffee beers available. 472 charactersdanh53, May 09, 2015

Aroma of espresso, burnt wood, banana peel, rubbing alcohol. dark chocolate and roasted malts. Aroma would be better if it was a bit stronger. Flavor follows with milk chocolate which dominates throughout providing a sweetness that at first is too much but you eventually get used too. Additional notes of coffee, vanilla, cake icing, milk, roasted malts and some espresso which doesn't overwhelm. Full and creamy body and light carbonation. Mouthfeel can't get any better. Very good brew. May be too sweet for some. Lucky to have had a chance to try this one. 637 characterskylehay2004, Nov 16, 2013

Appearance is amazing. Black, with a big mocha head, amazing retention and lacing. Truly stunning.
Smell is espresso, a tiny bit sharp. Super well supported by rich chocolate.
Taste is 3 parts coffee and 1 part chocolate. The coffee is rich and flavorful, not sharp, and balanced well by sweetness.
Feel is outstanding. Rich and heavy, but fluffy. The nitro is an excellent touch.
A fantastic stout. Great coffee and chocolate malt presence. Happy I got to try this. 581 characterszeledonia, Nov 02, 2013

It poured jet black with a thin brown head. Huge chocolate and roasted malts on the nose followed with coffee, caramel, raisins, and cherries. The coffee flavor comes out more in the taste, and it's mixed with thick, dark chocolate. It's like liquefied fudge poured into a coffee. It has a roasty malt characteristic with a touch of cherry on the finish. Goes down creamy and smooth and leaves you with a warming sensation from the alcohol. 484 charactersitsscience, Oct 29, 2013

Great looking creamy foamy 1/2 finger head fades at a med pace, huge legs and decent lacing, ridiculously super dark pitch black beer. Practically strains the glass. 
Nose brings pure awesome coffee, a light nutty aroma, nutty coffee mostly, little dark caramel and dark malts, chewy like dark molasses maybe, great awesomeness of coffee mild nutty and dark malts, hint cocoa, little syrup.
Taste is amazing, super thick dark malts, loads of chocolate and coffee. Dark thick melted bakers choc, creamy like maybe oats, milk choc, etc. Great nutty coffee, lots of awesome coffee, fresh roasted coffee beans. Then mild caramel and toffee like characters, into mild booze characters, little warming slight tingly booze. so much creamy awesome coffee dark choc goodness. Finish is a bit dry but lots more dark malt, bakers choc, little bitterness, little dark choc oat character, great awesomeness.
Mouth is full bod, super thick little booze, decent carb.
Overall holy shit! This is up there with the best beers I've ever had. So much awesome, I'm glad I was able to try this. We had a slew of amazing beers on the night and this was the winner big time! Big thanks Chris! 1,277 charactersjlindros, Sep 28, 2013

T - Taste is just incredible, stupendous coffee and chocolate notes, bitter roast, chocolate rich and bakers chocolate, super creamy and code, like a mocha cappuccino. Super nice bitter roast with a nice lingering creamy iced coffee notes, incredible.
M - Mouthfeel is just silly creamy delicious, just velvet goodness.

There is just a wisp of a light brown ring on top and no real signs of lacing. The aroma takes charge with a thick sweet coffee chocolate with cherry malt and marshmallow vanilla. The flavor is similarly spectacular with intense coffee and dark chocolate. Again I get sweet cherry vanilla with woodsy undertones. There's just a vague hint if alcohol which just adds a satisfying warmth as it slides down. There's plenty of bitter licorice malt. Tart, sweet, intense but not at all cloying. Thick but velvety smooth. Just a near perfect brew, a defining stout. 628 charactersDurge, Sep 20, 2013

Pours black as night, with a light brown head with little lace. The aroma hits hard with coffee beans and roasted malts, cocoa, vanilla, and dates. The taste has plenty of medium bitter coffee roast notes, chocolate, toffee, candi sweetness. Pretty thick and chewy, full bodied easy. Overall, pretty great coffee stout! 358 charactersEgadBananas, Sep 16, 2013

On the nose there is a lot of dark roasted malts, and tons of fresh coffee beans.
The beer is thick, viscous, and strong. The body on this beer is something you would expect from a beer with 15% ABV, not 9. Incredibly rich. Lots of dark malty goodness, and a lot of coffee flavor. 
Basically like a slightly lighter Marshall Zhukov with an excellent coffee addition. CCB does stouts better than just about anyone else. 480 charactersDanny1217, Sep 03, 2013
4.6/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5On tap at the brewery, nitro tap. Pours thick and rich with a dark brown head. Huge coffee and chocolate in the aroma coming off a dark brown creamy head. Bittersweet coffee flavor and full body, then comes the chocolate sauce and more coffee. No sign of the 9.2% ABV. Also had this in the morning at a Kegs and Eggs brunch at the brewery and still tasted great. Maybe a bit much for breakfast... Just awesome. Very sweet. Wow. (4.31)
Having it out of the bottle now and honestly this is a cloying mess just like Huna has been the last couple batches. Take it easy on the vanilla. Jesus. (3.67)
Newer batch and espresso is off the charts. Everything this beer is supposed to be. Wow. (4.6) 691 charactersBMMillsy, Sep 03, 2013

A: Yet another CCB stout very dark, almost pitch black with little light penetrating. A very small dark brown head which retreats into a nice crown rather quickly.
S: On my first whiff I immediately pick up Coffee and Chocolate with hints of dark roasted malt. A bit of sweetness comes through at the end as well.
T: The taste follows the smell very well. A nice balance of Coffee and Chocolate and Roasted Malt. As it warms a bit I find the sweetness matching with a nice Chocloate flavor while the Coffee takes up the back bringing a nice close to this one.
M: CCB stouts always leave me confused when describing mouthfeel. I always think they could use a little thicker feel at first but, then I end up with a beautiful coating over my mouth that is always very pleasant. This one has a light carbonation as to be expected with the style. Very nice over all.
O: Cigar City never dissapoints with their Stouts. This is a great beer that represents the style very nicely. Congrats guys on another good beer. If you are in the area swing by the Brewery and grab a glass. Consistent aroma and taste matched with a nice mouthfeel makes for a good drink. 1,259 charactersTone2467, Sep 02, 2013

A- Black as oil like you would expect from CCB. Very small, tan head forms at the top. Stains my hands like Hunahpu's if you spill a drop.
S- Coffee, chocolate, a spice I am assuming to enhance the coffee flavor.
T- Unreal good coffee flavor. This competes with some of the best coffee stouts out there IMHO. Chocolate adds a nice balance so it isn't too much sweet or acidic coffee.
M- thick and coats perfectly. Carbonation is a little low but still very enjoyable.
O- love this beer and hope it stays on their tap/growler list for some time. 610 charactersTheChef18, Sep 02, 2013

3.94/5  rDev -12.8%look: 5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4On tap at Coffee District. Served in a Duvel tulip.
Appearance - Really thick black body. Big dark chocolate head. Looks like Zhukov. Impressive. 
Smell - Not a ton of aroma. Coffee and dark chocolate malt. Booze.
Taste - Lots of chocolate. Arguably more chocolate than coffee, especially up front. Coffee builds and even becomes a bit acidic in the finish.
Mouthfeel - Very thick. Standard fare for a Cigar City stout, but the acidity cuts back on the mouthfeel. 
Overall - The coffee is too acidic for me. Impressive stout otherwise. 540 charactersAlieniloquium, Sep 01, 2013

The smell of the beer is loaded with coffee aromas, not much else really but loads of coffee. The taste is similar to that as well, some very elegant coffee flavors in this beer mixed with the heavy malt backbone that the beer was made from. The feel is super rich, lots of stickiness. Overall it's a great stout, I'd expect this from CCB who knows a thing or two about making beers of this style. 497 charactersKnapp85, Aug 29, 2013

4.56/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Reviewed from notes. Had on nitro-tap at CCB tasting room. Served in a snifter.
A: Very dark rich brown, large thick creamy brown head. Standard nitro movement in the snifter, and quite opaque.
S: Coffee, creamy, light chocolate, lactose sweetness.
T: Follows the nose. A nice medium-roast coffee flavor that isn't overly bitter, with creamy lactose and milk chocolate following that. I wouldn't say it's a particularly complex flavor, but wow is it tasty.
M: Insanely creamy - both the milkiness and the nitro serving contributing here - and velvety smooth. Moderate alcohol presence, although for the listed ABV it's quite well-hidden. I would give the mouthfeel a 6 out of 5 if I could.
O: This was incredible on nitro. I didn't have the chance to try the regular carbonated version, but the flavors were amazing so I don't think it would suffer any fall-off. This is at least one of my top five favorite non-barrel aged stouts I've ever had. 950 charactersmacrosmatic, Aug 18, 2013

4.17/5  rDev -7.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Enjoyed a snifter @ WOB Dr. Phillips Orlando.
Appearance jet black holding up a paper thin tan head. Apparent thick viscosity when swirled in the glass. Classic motor oil presentation.
The dark espresso aroma is the big initial hit on the nose. This is quickly followed by aromatic notes of cocoa, dark roasted malts, raisins and figs.
Taste is simply outstanding. First sip approaches some cloying sweetness for a moment but just a touch of bitter dark roast coffee bean and malt slips in behind the sweetness. Fantastic balance of the bitter-sweet qualities. Finishes with a mildly sweet dark dried fruit and cream ending.
Mouthfeel is slick and smooth; thick and chewy. Perfect for this style of beer.
This is not one to miss!! 735 charactersmacster, Aug 17, 2013

4.31/5  rDev -4.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5I've had the pleasure of having multiple snifters of this over the last week at CCB... I've had a couple on nitro and one from the growler bar that was a standard CO2 push.
Appearance is thick, black, with a thick creamy tan head as you would expect from a nitro pour. 
Aroma has some chocolatey sweetness and a strong coffee presence. I love me some big coffee beers and this fit the bill for sure.
Mouthfeel is everything you've come to expect in a stout from CCB. Thick, luscious, and velvety from the nitro. 
Taste is pure decadence. This beer is pretty sweet but not cloying. The coffee flavor is strong but not overwhelming, however I drink a lot of coffee so the coffee may be overpowering for some. Also a lot of chocolate roasty notes as well. Kinda like drinking a chocolate shake that's been melted and blended with strong coffee. 
Overall, this is one of the better stouts that CCB has released recently. The base for this beer is a batch of Marshal Zhukov that underattenuated, so instead of dumping it they added the coffee and made a potential screw-up into a thing of beauty. To be honest I preferred the standard CO2 pour to the nitro pours that I had. The nitro pours were good, but I feel like the nitro may have muted some of the flavors. The standard CO2 pour had an extra layer of complexity for me that I didn't get from the nitro. This is a very dangerous beer. It weights in at 9.2% ABV but is a very easy drinker, more like something in the 5-6% range. 1,483 charactersjoshodonn, Aug 16, 2013

Served on nitro tap and also in growlers 8/14/2013.
Served in a snifter at CCB. Pours fairly thick with an immense creamy nitro head. Smells of cocoa and coffee with some malt. Tastes exactly like it smells with coffee and cocoa pretty prominent with a very smooth and velvety texture. I admit I like coffee and cocoa notes in my stouts and my scoring reflects this. If you are put off by cocoa and coffee this brew may not be for you. Takes two or more rinses to clean the snifter, just as a good stout should! Really quite decadent and yet another in a long line of stouts that CCB has knocked out of the park. 
Some of the creaminess is lost when served from a growler and minus the nitro. No real surprise and still superb...
Certainly a beer that I'd buy often if available in a nitro can/bottle... Hint, hint! 848 characterswiltznucs, Aug 14, 2013
