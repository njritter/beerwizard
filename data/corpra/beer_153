S: Flavorful stout with coconut, cinnamon, and mild all spice
T: The sweetness is much debated on this beer, but for me the BA stout notes were well complemented by the rum aging's deep, rich flavors
F: Medium-bodied mouthfeel with an even carbonation
O: A distinctive offering in the world of BA stouts and one worth trying - for me the coconut and sweetness weren't overpowering, but actually well paired with the richness and depth of the bold stout chocolate and molasses notes. Great offering from Cycle. 591 charactersFireman_RK, Dec 19, 2015

Really nice beer, wonderful lace and head, smells like I imagined it would, maybe a touch more Coconut/Marshmallow than I thought but tasty. The only knock is in feel, finishes pretty dry.

Pours very dark, near pitch black oil with a burnt mocha head.  Aroma is dominated by rich rum, coconut, booze, some oak and dark chocolate, little hit of a darker fruit as well.  Very smooth, the rum flavors are very intense, but everything is a little thin.
Very nice rum aged stout. 411 characterstimc100, Jan 19, 2015

3.89/5  rDev -13.2%look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Appearance:  A fairly hard pour produces a half inch of mocha foam that quickly fades to a ringlet and archipelago; some dots of lace linger behind
Smell:  Rum dominates the aroma to such an extent that it is hard to pick up anything else, except perhaps for a hint of blackberry
Taste:  As in the aroma, the rum is dominant, though there are chocolate, oak, vanilla and blackberry tones underneath; the sweetness builds, like sorghum syrup, through the middle and into the finish, where the blackberry returns to deliver a slight amount of tartness
Mouthfeel:  Full bodied and rather viscous, with low carbonation
Overall:  Well, I am clearly in the minority on this one, but I want the barrel to complement rather than dominate the base beer; this beer tastes primarily like rum with a thick mouthfeel and only a modest alcohol burn; I can see why it is highly rated but it is not my thing

A: Pours black, thick and creamy, with a finger of khaki head that reduces slowly and leaves no lacing. There's a nice collar in the glass throughout. 
S: Strong chocolate notes up front, with huge wafting rum aromas along the way. I get quite a bit of vanilla that lingers on the back end. 
T: Chocolate, vanilla, only a slight amount of roast, and a hint of rum that hangs on with every sip. But mostly chocolate. It's almost like drinking a creamy dark chocolate milk that has some vanilla bean ice cream melted into it. 
M: Rich, thick, creamy. Carbed well, leaves a sweet smooth after taste. 
O: This is a very well crafted beer, I can't believe how dominant the chocolate comes across. Glad I got a chance to try this one, the rum barrel aging was a great treatment. 808 charactersroger617, Oct 19, 2014

A: Pours a motor oil black, with a thin, fizzy layer of dark brown head, receding momentarily to a persistent collar.  Some dotting of lacing and pretty good retention for what’s there.
S: Rich dark cocoa with light roast providing some contrast/structure, melding wonderfully together.  Moderate oak and boozy, slightly spiced rum in the secondary and carries through a medium-long finish.  A touch of medium-dark coffee and dark chocolate bar.
T: Dark chocolate, some flavor of spirits comes through a bit more than on the nose.  Light to moderate sweetness that works nicely with the other components.  Rounded out with some oak and tannins on a dry finish.
M: Medium-light body seems like it should be too light, but it just enhances the drinkability.  Light, subtle carbonation.  Alcohol is very well hidden.
O: Tasty and well constructed.  They get the rum barrel flavor integrated and without overpowering the base.  Pretty easy drinking. 989 characterspmarlowe, Oct 06, 2014

I specially like that this is more like drinking syrup, rather than having a beer. Pours a really dark beer. Forms a nice head. Smells like coffee, and roasts. Taste is nice and smooth, dark and bitter yet not like a stout. This beer is like a syrup. High alcohol content will knock you out soon. It will also fill you quickly. 344 charactersJulioH, Sep 12, 2014

A big thanks to allisonmichelle for sending this over via trade!  I was at the original release of this beer at a Peg's Barrel Aged Day a few years.  Unfortunately I got the regular Rare first (which was exceptional), but when I went back to get a poor or the RareR it was sold out.  Ive been waiting to try it ever since. 4.5
A: Pours an absolutely opaque jet black with 1 fingers width of dense appearing mocha colored head.  Head dissipates down fairly quickly, and leaves some small patch of lacing.  4.5
S: The nose is fantastic.  Lot of sweetness with vinous dark fruits, and some cocoa. I also get roasty characters, and big rum barrel notes along with some booze.  4.5
T: At first I get tons of roasty notes coupled with a big semi-sweet chocolate character.  I then get some dark fruit notes and a bit of black coffee bitterness.   Fairly big rum notes, as well as a raw oak character and some booze.  Rum barrel charaters strengthen throughout the drink.  I dont get the big coconut flavors I got in Rare, although I do start to get some subtle toasted coconut towards the end of the first glass.   Excellent beer, although I think I prefer the regular Rare DOS (that being said I most definitey prefer bourbon to rum so that makes sense).  4.5
M/D: A little on the thinner side for an elite example of the style, would benefit from being thicker/chewier. ABV is well restrained and drinkability is god.    3.75
O: Excellent beer, but I prefer regular Rare DOS.  That being said this is great and definitely worth seeking out. 4.5 1,574 characterszac16125, Sep 04, 2014

4.5/5  rDev +0.4%The beer pours inky black with a big foamy dark tan head that settles quickly around the perimeter. It has a nose rich in chocolate/caramel malt sweetness which is accentuated by subtle rum barrel spice - there;s nothing in-your-face or unpleasant and the alcohol is under wraps. The taste is equally sweet and big bodied with rounded out rum barrel notes that leave a syrupy spicy/chocolate coating on the palate and does little to produce an ethanol burn or bitterness (though there is some roast). It's an impressive BA stout, one I'd consider very drinkable and carefully balanced, but still difficult to acquire. 618 charactersThePorterSorter, Aug 30, 2014

4.63/5  rDev +3.3%Bottle popped and shared with Jared and John at iTap last night
A - Pours dark as night, thick and viscous with a half finger mocha foam head that holds for a bit. Medium lacing that stains the glass a bit. 
S - As soon as I popped the bottle you could smell the rum, vanilla and chocolate. Once the three glasses were poured, you could smell it 5 feet away. Intense notes of sweet rum, vanilla, oak, chocolate, and hints of dark fruits.
T - The taste follows the nose to a point. Sweet carmel, chocolate, vanilla, dominate the front of the palate, with dark fruits, raisins figs dates plum coming through with tobacco notes that remind me of a mellowed out rum zhukov. Finish lingers and leaves a pleasurable taste in the mouth.
M - Chewy, thick viscous and velvety. Drinks very smooth and wouldn't be tough to dome this myself.
O -Another great beer from Tampa. They are killing it down there and this reminded me of a more chocolate vanilla forward rum zhukov. 970 charactersdrmcleod10, Aug 17, 2014

Appearance: Black with tan head that leaves rather quickly and a ring remains with a little lacing.
Smell: It really is a bit subdued, hopefully as it warms up a bit the nose will become more apparent. After a while getting slight coffee, milk chocolate and alcohol. After 30 minutes (went out for a drive) I'm getting a little dark fruit on the nose.
Taste: Ah, this is what it's all about! Chocolate, dark fruit, a very slight booziness in the finish; almost a chocolate milkshake flavor, interesting. Very, very nice.
Mouthfeel: This is where it falls a little flat, too thin. This factor seems a bit odd and doesn't jive with everything else it has going for it.
Overall: So glad to finally crack this as I have been holding on to it for about 14 months. Damn, if only the mouthfeel was better it would score above the average. Still a wonderful experience! Now, if someone would send me one that was released today I could part with a Damon, ha-HA! 985 charactersbobv, Jul 23, 2014

My 450th beer rating, deserves a review..
A: Jet Black, Minimal to No head. Motor Oil.
S: I get lots of chocolate, some vanilla, some fruit, some rum. Very sweet.
T: Full body, thick and almost chewy with slightly lower carbonation. Not too boozy, but at the same time the rum barrels are there! I got more rum from the taste as opposed to the smell.
F/M: Creamy goodness, yet very light
O: I was very pleased with this beer, and it lived up to my expectations and hype. I am certainly interested to see how this will age in bottles and other BA offerings from Cycle/Pegs in the future.. 612 charactersIPAIsaac, Jul 23, 2014

A- Black as tar into the plastic cup provided with a creamy dark mocha head to about one finger high. Decent head retention and it eventually falls to a frothy ring leaving fine sheets of thin lace.
S- Somewhat faint to me for this type of the beer, first beer of the day too. Some nice dark cocoa, fudge and hints of whiskey oak barrels.
T- Dark, bitter cocoa nibs lead the way for me with a barrage of chocolate and cocoa powder. Some ripe cherry fruit hints but no raisin or spiciness like some brews can have. Bourbon is here but integrated well with oak, whiskey and a slight vanilla feel.
MF- Thick and chewy bodied with a heavy whipped creamy texture. Fairly warm whiskey bite and the medium level of carbonation allows the flavors to come through well.
Another impressive marriage of whiskey barrels and stouts. Something about the aroma wasn't quite up to par for me but the flavor made up for it. 1,019 characterscbutova, Dec 01, 2013

Weaker mocha head. Nose is vanilla, hazelnut, praline, waxy dark chocolate, malted milk balls, cocoa powder. Taste is excellent, woah, so much praline, amaretto, toasted almond, brownie, hazelnut/Nutella, dark cherry, malted milk balls. Palate is lighter, easy to drink, a tad thin and lemony.

Hill Farmstead wine glass
A: Pours essentially pitch black. There was a pop on the growler, but no head. Only a thin ring or collar around edges of the glass. Conjure up some lacing bits with a swirl. Alcohol feet.
S: Smells fabulous, and not infected! Sweet booze notes on the nose. Sweeter than a bourbon barrel with the rum barrel. Candied sugar. Toffee. Caramel. Dark bitter chocolate. Booze. Fudge.
T: Initial flavor is that rum barrel sweetness. Them you get that dark bitter chocolate. Toffee, vanilla and caramel. Not a ton of roast in this, unless its covered but the barrel. Some dark fruits. Finish is long. Lingering sweetness. Alcohol warmth grows on you.
M: Full bodied. Not as creamy as I expected. 740 charactersinlimbo77, Sep 10, 2013

They do a fantastic job at this bar of serving their beers at optimal temperature. I am confident that I had this beer at its very best thanks to Mikkeller
A - A near-black brown color followed by a thin line of medium-brown as a bed for a thick tan and fluffy head.
S - Light light coffee with sugar, nuts and an unmistakable scent of rum. Blackberries and slightly woody. Inoffensive, and easy to smell without any sting.
T - Hershey's chocolate syrup was the first thing I noticed. The fruit and rum come out around the sides of my tongue while mocha, vanilla, roasted nuts, and spiced wood run over the top. Just fantastic finish. A little more rum in the after taste, but not overpowering - just enough to remind you of what you just tasted
M - Surprisingly light on the tongue and throat. I hear others saying thick and chewy, but I would say it is in the middle somewhere. Very easy to drink, I could drink it fast, so I force myself to enjoy it over time.
O - If this is the only beer I could ever drink for the rest of my life, I would be okay with that. Just fantastic. If I saw this was tap again, I would go out of my way to make a trip to the pub. World class - easily a top-3 for me. Jeez, this is good stuff. 1,310 charactersSwongler, Sep 10, 2013

Pours a thick inky black color with a tiny tan head that dissipates quickly. The aroma is heavy on the alcohol and rum with bits of roast, chocolate, dark pitted fruit and caramel. The flavor is chocolate, brown sugar, and caramel with a heavy presence of ethanol, rum and bits of earthy wood. Faint smokey malt and bits of dark fruit round out the flavor nicely. Medium to thick body with a light level of carbonation, and a slick, oily mouthfeel. This one gets a bit hot and is a sipper to be sure. This grew on me as I got towards the end. 613 charactersjohnnnniee, Aug 27, 2013

500ml flip-top growler poured into CBS snifter.
Appearance: Jet black bodied beer with a thick medium brown cap that drops to a ring around the glass.
Smell: This smells good! Boozey fudge brownies immediately come to mind! The booze has a bit of a spicy note to it. Lots of vanilla and chocolates. Hints of tabacco, roasty malt, and raisins. Great nose on this beer. 
Taste: Starts off sweet with lots of fudge, vanilla, and a touch of spicy booze. Roasty malts, oaky / woody barrel flavors and tobacco dominate the middle of this beers flavor profile. Sweetness returns in the finish of the beer with more fudge and vanilla. A hint of tobacco, also some light roast almost a smokey/charred note. Great balance to this stout and nice complexity and depth as well. As the beer warms to room temperature more roast, char, and tobacco dominate this beer. The rum starts to stand out much more as well; you can definately get the rum influence distinctly when this beer has open up! Wow! 
Mouthfeel: high end of a medium bodied beer almost a full bodied beer. This stout is fairly thick and kind of chewy; got a nice oily feel to it as well. Stickiness that blankets your mouth with big stout flavors. Low carbonation levels that suits this beer well. Also has a nice mild booze kick that also works wonderfully with this beer. The booziness gets a little smoother as the beer warms.
Overall: I havent tried very many rum barrel stouts. I have wanted to try this beer for a long time and I wasnt dissapointed! I am guessing that this beer is probably in the upper echelon of rum barrel aged stouts! I just dont see a rum barrel stout getting much better than this. I really like the subtle differences that a rum barrel adds to a stout. Brewers should age more stouts in rum barrels if you ask me! Also on a side note, I am really impressed how well this beer has held up in a flip top growler. When I first heard of this beer being in a 500ml flip top growler, my opinion was that you should probably drink it immediately. Honestly, I think that this beer could be cellared in the flip top glowler with solid results if you wanted to age this beer. I dont think that I would be able to cellar it personally because I prefer to drink all beers as fresh as possible(and this stout is rediculiously good!). I think that I will definately be seeking out more of these Peg's Cantina stouts in the future...they are definately worth your time and hard earned dollars! 2,515 characters4DAloveofSTOUT, Aug 20, 2013

S- Milk chocolate, vanilla, coconut, oak. Some sweet rum.
F- Sweet rum, vanilla, coconut flakes all make for a sweet dominant beer. There is some dark chocolate bitterness to balance it out though. Barrel oak, milk chocolate add some more depth.
M- Medium bodied, a bit lower in carbonation than expected but there are enough bubbles. A bit sticky, resinous. Finish is slightly hot and sweet.
O- Very nice stout that brings a good bit of rum and coconut, as befitting a Florida stout. 598 charactersStevedore, Aug 16, 2013

Thanks, HeyOhhh!
Black throughout. Thick in body, but not quite as heavy or substantial in appearance as a Dark Lord or a Cigar City stout. A fairly large dark brown head initially, especially for the style. It doesn't last too long and slides down the glass fairly quickly, leaving spots of stick down the glass. All in all, a gorgeous barrel-aged imperial stout.
The aroma is really lovely. Rich with dark fruits, thick, rich, sweet, and earthy molasses, a mild vanilla, and layers of chocolate. Mild wood and just a bit of the liquor/spirit bite. Very, very nice.
The flavor is just as good as the aroma. Layers of sticky, decadent, bittersweet chocolates, a bit of the spirit and barrel, dark fruits, and just a hint of coconut. A really exceptional complex, layered, but drinkable imperial stout.
Full in body, low to moderate carbonation for the style, but very drinkable. Incredibly sticky. After some sips, I feel like there's melted caramel or chocolate trying to keep my lips closed with their stick. Something special.
Fantastic. A really special barrel-aged imperial stout. Would gladly drink this one again, and again, and again. 1,175 charactersehammond1, Aug 03, 2013

Pitch black with almost no head. 
Aroma is rich and complex with rum, vanilla, fruits, coconut, roasted malt, oak, spices and slight chocolate. 
Taste is moderately sweet with vanilla, fruits, oak, cacao, spices and acidic notes , light bitternes 
 Full body. Low carbonation. 
Good Imperial Stout, but not a top-50 beers in my opinion. 380 charactersbeerpirates, Jun 04, 2013

A - Pours a super dark brown color, clarity is good and shows a clear dark brown around the edges. Low head of brown foam, no lacing.
S - Brownies, super fudgy and chocolatey, sweet, rum, molasses and vanilla
T - Fudgy, rum, caramel, chocolate, smokey with tons of roasted malt flavors.
M - Thick and full bodied, rich, rather sweet with a lower carbonation level. Very smooth - liquid candy. Super dessert beer.
O - Really outstanding beer. Smooth and thick with lots of complexity. Really good stuff. Glad to have the opportunity to try this one. 647 charactersportia99, May 30, 2013

4.17/5  rDev -6.9%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3 |  overall: 4.5I have been seeking this one out for some time as I heard many great things about this beer. I was able to land a 550ml swing top growler from a buddy who went to the End of the World Party at Peg’s Cantina & Brewpub in Gulf Port, FL. I was concerned about the growler being 6 months old (12-21-12) and called the brewery which assured me that the beer was going to be still good and may be somewhat infected which kind of turned me off a bit, but since I went out for this beer, I decided to go for it. The beer poured pitch black with razor thin tan head that dissipated quickly as expected. You could bring it back to life after giving the glass a vigorous whirl. I immediately picked up some dark fruit, chocolate, light notes of molasses, and that slight rum booze in the aroma. There was complexity in the flavor which I appreciated especially knowing how old this growler was – malts, caramel, molasses, dark fruit, vanilla, rum and oak. There were zero carbonation; extremely thin mouth feel. Overall, I would have loved to taste this special beer fresh but beggars cannot be choosers. This did still give me that delicious and complex flavor I had been hoping when I cracked open the growler and sure glad to have checked this off my beer wish list. 1,262 charactersCuriousMonk, May 24, 2013

4.45/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Taste the rare! Big thanks to Mike for splitting this one - I thought for sure I'd never get the chance to sample it, especially now. Comes in a cool looking 500 mL swing-top. It gluggs out in to the glass, very thick and completely black. No head - even the mere ring that outlines the beer is slow to form; possibly a side-effect of being in a growler for a few months, but my thought (and hope) is that the carb for a brew like this is relatively low anyway, so it shouldn't matter much.
The extra "R" in "RareR" supposedly stands for "rum", as this batch was aged in rum barrels as opposed to whiskey barrels in the regular Rare D.O.S., and the first smell reaffirmed that notion completely. Huge rum character on the nose; boozy rum cake, sweet molten chocolates, graham crackers, molasses, a touch of vanilla, and quite a bit of dark fruits. The fruits consist of plum, grapes, and even a bit of apples, and seem to get stronger as the brew approaches room temp. Rum and sweet molasses still remain the leaders of the pack, though.
The first sip reveals quite a bit more of those sweet dark fruits that were so heavy in the aroma; plums, grapes, black cherries, and even some apple skins. Sweet and creamy chocolates come crashing in, soaked in a boozy rum bath. It seemed a bit quiet at first, but the rum character comes out more and more with each successive sip. The rum, chocolate, and dark fruit combination is pretty highly discernable, giving RareR D.O.S. a nice uniqueness in market that's saturated with stouts.
Waves of malts continue to grow in robustness and complexity with time; molasses, chocolate, caramel, and some brown sugar. The oak and woody character is either very low or just completely buried underneath all of the other flavors. The largest components of the barrel aging are definitely the vanilla and the rum itself. The finish is lightly boozy, never getting too hot, with even a mild finishing tartness from the fruits and a sweetness from the chocolates and molasses. Heavy bodied, thick and a bit chewy with an almost-creamy, slick and oily mouth feel.
It's hard to say whether or not this beer lived up to the "hype", because when a beer receives this much hype, your expectations are often raised to unreachable levels. So I'm going to try and forget those expectations and just say that RareR D.O.S. is a damn fine American imperial stout. Unique in many ways and highly complex. I wasn't expecting so much dark fruit sweetness, but it was integrated nicely and the rum provided a nice change of pace. Super glad I got to try this one, it was awesome - thanks, Mike! 2,612 characterstectactoe, May 12, 2013

S: The smell on this was less then I was expecting. There was sweetness from the rum and a decent amount of chocolate and roast.
T: This is very unique. The rum comes out first with a sweet almost candy like flavor. The chocolate then comes forward with dark fruits, plum and raisin. There is a hint of vanilla and oak on the back end of this beer. 
M: Very good body. It is silky smooth. I wish the carbonation was significantly heavier though.
O: A great stout. It is worth going after but not worth giving up too much for it. I prefer many stouts to this one. 708 charactersjvillefan, Apr 28, 2013

From a 500ml growler into a snifter
Bottled 21 December 2012
APPEARANCE: Pours out black and viscious but slightly transparent, yielding a small, medium looking tan head with decent retention. Head quickly fades to a faint wisp and ring. Black body and lower levels of carbonation evident. A ring remains but leaves no lacing down the glass. Dark with a nice head, but needs more staying power. 
SMELL: A bold nose of roasted malts, dark, pure chocolate, brownies, mocha coffee with a touch of caramel and molasses. Bold and plenty decadent. Bourbon, oak and vanilla in there, as well as lots of coconut, all playing nicely with the roasted, chocolaty base beer. Excellent. Complex, bold, well-balanced and extremely enticing. This is that good. 
TASTE: Roasted and chocoalte notes up front with nice pure, dark baker's chocolate before a powerful bourbon barrel finish. Bourbon, vanilla, oak and sweet flavors of caramel, lots of sweet cream and coconut, as well as molasses after the swallow, balanced with a nice dose of bitter dark chocolate. Barrel and base are wonderfully balanced here. The bourbon barrel is a little in forward here with plenty of sweet vanilla cream and coconut sweetness, but the roasted, chocolaty base with browines and molasses is there too. Wonderfully decadent. 
PALATE: Medium body and medium levels of carbonation. Slightly prickly and could be heavier on the palate, goes down fine with a slight scratch anf finishes slightly sticky. Some heat lingers. 
OVERALL: Phenomenal stuff. The Nose is unreal and the flavor top notch, so only the slightly light and rough palate keep this from virtual perfection. A creamier and somewhat heavier feel would make this other worldly. Very happy to have had the chance to try this beer, and hope to see more Peg's brews on this side of the pond. You've created a monster urwithdave. Cheers! 2,034 charactersJeffo, Apr 26, 2013

Pour was as expected for the style, plenty of carbonation. The smell was off old cardboard not pleasant at all, probably the worse part of the beer. The taste had a slight sour cherry, vinous taste that kept growing taste after taste. The mouth feel was not as thick as desired. Honestly, though I hate to say it, this seemed like an infected fill. Really bummed about this as I love quality rum and was looking forward to this. 493 charactersnanobrew, Apr 13, 2013

500ml growler dated 12-21-2012 into a Central Waters snifter.
A- Pours slick rich black with a minimal tan head that's fades quick to only line the glass with a few waves of tan swirling about.
S- deep rich booze of chocolates and sweets. Just a hit on toasted marshmallow and sugar.
T- chocolate frosting, bits of dry cocoa, and a sweet marshmallow boozy finish. 
M- light and thin medium type body. This beer coats your tongue and won't let go. Syrupy sticky finish with a touch of boozey heat. 
O- I though this was an outstanding stout. Really close to one of my most recent favorites 2012 Black Tuesday. I like the balance of this beer and all the flavors that are constantly bouncing around. Wish it was as easy to acquire as Black Tuesday or some other huge stouts I've had lately. 853 charactersKeyportnick, Apr 12, 2013

A: Pours a dark black color with some cola edges. A thin tan head forms on the pour and recedes to a thin ring. Some splotches of lace are left down the glass.
S: A ton going on here. Marshmallows and rum booze. Oak with some vanilla. Dark chocolate with some raisin-like dark fruit flavors. More sweet than earthy. Brownie with some rum fruitiness.
T: Just like nose. Incredibly smooth booze notes. The rum is sweet and adds a fruitiness to the beer that is very nice. Dark chocolate with some molasses. Raisin sweetness with some bitter roasted malts. A tinge of oak with some vanilla and caramel sweetness.
M: Medium to heavy bodied with a slick and oily mouthfeel. Medium low carbonation with a very smooth finish. 
O: Absolutely delicious. Incredibly smooth and the rum barrel really added a unique fruitiness that was enjoyable. Much better than the Rum Huna I had over the summer. 1,031 charactersTreebs, Apr 11, 2013

(A)- Pours nearly pitch black in color. Minimal tan froth and lacing.
(S)- A really nice rich aroma to it overall. Sweet chocolate and molasses/raisin profile. Ever so slightly dry with great barrel characters.
(T)- Similar to the smell pretty much, only a rum-like barrel fruitiness with dark raisin, chocolate, molasses and subtle oak-like vanilla at the end.
(M)- A very smooth carbonation level with a superbly balanced and smooth but malty barrel aged combination. Chocolatey but velvety smooth too.
(O)- An extremely smooth barre-aged stout that is expertly integrated together and well-blended. Easily the most impressive Rum finish I have seen. Definitely lives up to its reputation. Thanks again Eric! 783 characterssweemzander, Apr 08, 2013

Appearance: Pours a murky opaque black with a small 1 finger brown crown that shows some retention and lace. 
Smell: Dark fruits, rum, cocoa, lightly charred oak, black strap molasses, a hint of coconut, and a whisper of raspberries. 
Taste: Same as the nose with the dark fruits, raspberry, and rum dominating up front. The chocolate (almost a "malted" quality) transitions the beer while the rum tinge carries all the way through to the finish. The coconut appears towards the tail end as well. A bit more muddled than the nose but still quite tasty. The dark fruits and the rum play together very nicely.
Mouthfeel: Thin side of thick bodied, low carbonation, a touch syrupy in a good way, with a long lingering rum barrel flavored finish.
Overall: A pretty solid imperial stout that I wish I had more access to. My growler fill was topped off as much as possible and it seems like it was co2 flushed first because the beer has no signs of oxidation / infection that I can discern. A very interesting beer just make sure you let it warm up to fully unlock its complexity. 1,193 characterskoopa, Mar 26, 2013

A - Not hugely black but definitely a thick, deep rosewood. Very soft whips of carbonation atop, but no true head. No lacing but leaves a tan residual film. Plentiful alcohol legs.
S - Rum spirit, freshly charred oak, sherry, honey cake, raisiny biscuit, and light cocoa. No alcohol whatsoever.
T - Front palate immediately shows the rum character, which blends well into roasted almond, huge alcohol-soaked fig, stone fruits, and plentiful oak tannic bitterness.
M - Lighter body than it looks, very low but appropriate carbonation, very dry finish. Slight ethanol warming.
D - I suspect I'd prefer the bourbon version, but this is easily the finest rum treatment I've come across and the flavors are executed with obvious purpose. 821 charactersAuracom, Mar 11, 2013

A- Pours black with a thin khaki head. Looks super thick and viscous.
S- Loads of dark chocolate, chocolate cake, vanilla, and coconut. The barrel character is mild but lends some nice rum notes as well as mild sweetness and oak.
T- Again, massive dark chocolate flavor, vanilla, coconut, along with some rum and oak. It's very rich and very complex. The barrel flavors are understated and work very well with the base beer, although I think I slightly prefer the bourbon barrel treatment.
M- Full-bodied, low carbonation, thick, viscous, sticky, just a bit of alcohol warmth.
O- Another incredible stout from Peg's, I preferred Rare over this, but this was still a wonderful brew, this whole series of stouts is really amazing. 760 charactersWillCarrera, Mar 09, 2013

Pours with no head, as expected, super pitch black beer, with thick syrupy legs!
Nose is awesome! oh my! Great chocolate, big malts, syrupy, thick rich cocoa, little roast and coffee, aged malts as well, dark chocolate, just a touch of dark fruit even.
Taste is delicious! Lush thick and rich, tons of chocolate, velvety, dark malting chocolate, chewy oats, hint of sweet sugary fruitiness too which I assume is from the rum barrel with a touch of vanilla oak too, light bitterness, melting rich chocolate, so thick, lush, tasty, just awww yeah.... Long lush finish, hint of bitterness, hint vanilla oak barrel, velvety lush mouth coating.
Mouth is full rich thick bodied, velvety, lighter but decent carb.
Overall holy shit, this def earned it's reputation, very good beer, very good! 890 charactersjlindros, Mar 04, 2013

4.72/5  rDev +5.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.7516 ounce growler poured into 10 ounce Kentucky Bourbon Barrel Stout snifter.
A: Pour is thick and muddy. This one has sat in the growler for about 2 months and looks to be fairly low on carbonation, although a thin layer of mocha colored foam briefly makes an appearance across the top of the beer. Swirling surprisingly provides a consistent ring around the edge of the glass. I'm a bit torn on how to rate the appearance on this one, as I realize the lack of head is in part attributable to this sitting in a growler for 2 months.
S: My first rum barrel stout and I enjoy the contribution to the nose this spirit provides. Picking up a nice amount of dark fruits in this, along with milk chocolate, vanilla, and an underlying roastiness. Smell indicates this will be moderately sweet.
T: Really interesting complexity here. Opens up all fruit, mainly cherries. There is a distinct point when this transitions on the tongue from sweet dark fruits to a roasty dark chocolate with underlying coffee. This isn't an experience I have had with many other beers but makes for tremendously interesting drinking. The rum appears at the very end and ties everything together.
M: The low carbonation apparent on the pour carries over into the mouthfeel. It actually works for this beer though and contributes a silky, creamy, and thick feel. This is one of the thicker stouts I've had; it really coats the tongue.
O: I really enjoyed this beer. Chocolate covered cherries blend with roasted coffee and bittersweet chocolate. The rum presence is light but apparent on the back end. Really glad I had the opportunity to enjoy this one. 1,629 charactersdbc5, Feb 27, 2013
3.82/5  rDev -14.7%look: 3.5 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 412oz. waxed flip-top growler into a Brooklyn Brewery snifter. Shared with schen9303. 
Pours pitch black with a .5 finger of dark mocha head with poor retention. Lacing is spotty, stringy and sparse with little stick but huge, oily legs that really coat the glass. Decent considering the serving and beer style. 
Nose is dark fruit, sweet raspberry, chocolate, cocoa, and roasted malt. Rather subtle with a sweet and very mellow tartness. I wonder if this one is starting to get a bit infected...
Opens slightly tart dark fruit. Chocolate, cocoa, and fudge in the middle with still, a slightly tart and sweet dark prune and plum presence. Finish is molasses, chocolate, and more dark fruit. Aftertaste is a mellow booziness with a slight roasted malt sweet and tartness. This one grew on me with time. Solid overall. 
Full bodied with low carbonation. Smooth, thick, and silky in the mouth and goes down warm and subtle. Messy finish with a sticky aftertaste. One of the thicker beers I've had from this style. Real smooth though. 
A very well crafted beer overall but this is a far cry from Rare DOS which was one of the best beers of its style. A touch too much fruit presence for my taste and not as sweet as I'd like. However, the feel is there, as is the complexity. Drink this one now if you have it. It's not getting any better with age. 1,348 charactersSpeedwayJim, Feb 25, 2013

A: Pours out pitch black with only a thin creamy brown head. The foam fades into almost nothing, and there is very little lacing to speak of. 
S: The nose is milk chocolate, vanilla, dark malt, and barrel aging. This beer smells sweet and inviting, but not over the top sweet.
T: Like the nose, I get a lot of chocolate, some stone fruits, a touch of roast, and some vanilla. This beer is excellent.
M: Full bodied beer. It's sweet and syrupy, coats the palate but moves off nicely. Lingering chocolate and vanilla. The sweetness sticks around for a bit and then fades.
O: This is a fantastic beer. I like my stouts more on the burnt toast side, but the sweetness here is really great. I'm extremely happy to have been able to try it, and I'd love to drink it again someday. 817 characterstrxxpaxxs, Feb 19, 2013

S - Booze, chocolate, sweet dark fruit, wood.
T - Booze, then some chocolate and barrel, it hits in stages, all good.
D - Silky smooth with good carbonation and a heavier body.

Normally, I'd inquire into the acronyms, but the fact that it's "rarer" soothes my mind. It pours a deep, dark black-brown topped by a half-finger of tan foam. The nose comprises roasted malts, dry cocoa, wood, and a thick layer of dark rum throughout the background. The taste brings in more of the same, with a richer sense of roast and cocoa, and with a mild booziness pervading the proceedings. The body is a solid medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a smooth feel. Overall, a very nice rum-barreled stout, one that would likely be ridiculous if a touch less boozy and if the barrel expressed itself a touch more. As is, it's just really good. 679 charactersTMoney2591, Feb 17, 2013

Appearance is viscous and opaque. Almost no head. The nose is heavily rum forward with chocolate and brownie in the background. The taste is decadent. The rum is well integrated with the hefty stout base. Layers of coconut, vanilla, chocolate, and fudge all are at play. The flavors are well balanced and I don't get any of the heat that I got on the nose. Mouthfeel is heavy and smooth. Delicious brew, definitely worth seeking out. 483 charactershomebrew311, Feb 16, 2013

Growler to CycleBrewing Snifter
500ml
Shared with GuruDel
Thanks to Hoppy99 for this one
App- This poured out of the growler with a little hiss. I had been holiding it for the right time and SB was that time. A big black inky pour. Along the lines of a BCS or that nature, with less bubbles. A bit flat and still. Maybe a 1/16" of bubbles around the edges.
Smell- This had a lot going on in the nose. It was highly creamy and malty and a bit rich and smooth at the same time. The dark fruits along with the vanilla, oak, rum and bakers chocoalate really rounded it out. Most things were subtle on this and took a while to find them all. Was a bit over temp for me to smell them.
Taste- I enjoyed this but really wasnt blown away. It was smooth and creamy but retained a certain bitter and grainy rum flavor that didnt really do it for me. The dark fruits and the blending of chocolate/vanilla made this one a bit of a off beer for me, but with the hype it was bound to happen. Still a very good stout with a lot of layers and complexity in the glass.
Mouth- The best part of this beer by far. The creamy body was a bit deep and low and the solid low carbonation with its thickness, enhanced all the flavors quite well. A bit delicate and thick at the same time but lots going on and very flavorful.
Drink- This was a huge want of mine and I cant thank Hoppy99 enough. A great beer that I was able to share with a drinking buddy and enjoy while watching the SB. I was a tad let down, but with Whales it happens. Still better than 95% of whats out there. 1,578 charactersFosterJM, Feb 11, 2013

This beer poured a midnight crude oil black. It's one of those beers where light will just bounce of it like somebody lathered sunscreen on the glass. On top of this black beauty was a beautiful espresso colored 1/2 to 3/4 of an inch head of foam. It had excellent retention! It never really receded. A small skim of foam lasted until the last drop of beer was gone. It left behind a ton of sticky espresso colored spots and streaks of lace around the glass. 
Pleasant but not not super strong aroma. It wasn't strong, but it had plenty going on it. It was a very well mixed aroma of rum, oak, black cherry, roasted coffee beans, dark chocolate, caramel, rum raisins, and then it finishes up with a nice splash of vanilla to round everything off. It wasn't a little bit of this and a little bit that, except for the vanilla. It smelled like everything was equally balanced. 
The taste was just as good as the aroma, but it had its differences. The taste kicked off with a nice mild to medium taste of rum and oak. The rum and oak wasn't strong enough to run away with the taste. That's fine because there's a lot going on in here. Following the rum and oak was some roasted coffee beans, a pinch of black cherry, a speck of black licorice, dark chocolate, sweet rum raisins, and a subtle hint of vanilla at the finish line. Once the beer really warms up, the rum comes out more. However it still doesn't take over the taste. Great taste! 
Full bodied with a nice aftertaste of rum, oak, coffee, dark chocolate, rum raisins, and a drop of vanilla. The taste that sticks around for the longest amount of time happens to be the sweet rum raisins. Wonderful aftertaste. 
It's truly a great beer! The rum and oak didn't run this beer. What ran this beer was a wide range of flavors. Would I drink it again? Hell yeah I would. I just wish that I was allowed more than 3 bottles.  2,080 charactersAltBock, Feb 06, 2013

Pours creamy dark chocolate color, not a great deal of head but for an island of light vanilla floating in the middle.
Smell is wonderful though not incredibly powerful. Lots if sweet vanilla, caramel, chocolate, rum, very balanced and appealing.
Damn. This tastes perfect. Loads of vanilla again, caramel and chocolate and other wonderful sweet stout flavors. Not super roasty. Barrel complements perfectly but his is not really barrel forward. Insanely well balanced, all my favorite stout flavors are here.
I don't know if it's the mouthfeel or just the flavor, but I find this insanely drinkable and almost cried when the bottle was empty.
This lived up to and exceeded the hype in a big way. One of the best stouts I've ever had for sure. Not bold or outrageous but just perfect.

pours black, bit of a thick body but not sticky or cloying. little to no head, lacing, retention.
light rum and booze on the nose, light chocolate and fudge. lots of roasted malt.
taste was a bit of the weakness IMO. there was some light cherry and rum up front with a faint chocolate body. the finish was heavy roasted malt. sounds great and all but i found most of the flavors muted and not really sticking out.
mild carbonation, a bit light body.
this did not wow me at all, it was good but no where near the trouble to get. 547 charactershooliganlife, Jan 27, 2013

Pours more or less like a glass of dark roast - a thin layer of caramel brown head dissipates quickly leaving behind a thin collar that laces a bit with plenty of oily booze remnants. Pretty good amount of cloudy beading beneath the head. I'm surprised and delighted by the amount of carbonation that remains.
Caramel covered, rum-soaked fruits explode from the bottle. Sweet oak melded with vanilla or even hazelnut. I'm glad to see that the sweetness is pretty dialed back, leaving room for a mellowed out rum, cocoa and dried fruit profile. Really nice in the nostrils if I do say so myself. 
Oh god damn... what a big old beautiful beer. Bittersweet chocolate and overripe red fruits, toffee and caramel, a nice twang from the rum contribution plays well against the earthiness of the oak. A hint of coffee grounds, maybe some molasses - pretty complex I think, evolving with every bit of warmth. Some boozy plum shows itself later on in the glass... finishes a bit sweeter than I anticipated but it works. Not too sticky and not too dry, great sense of balance in that regard.
I would love to try this one on tap. There's hardly any room for improvement but I think a fresh sample would really put this stuff over the edge. Fantastic.
Very grateful to have had the chance to try this gem. Thanks Jim! 1,382 charactersyamar68, Jan 26, 2013

The beer pours almost black in color with a quarter inch of good looking tan head. The head leaves a ring around the pour. It smells a bit hot. I'm getting some vanilla notes along with rum and dark fruit. The taste is very sweet with a nice rum note right away. Lots of roasted malt to back up the sweetness that is accentuated by the rum barrel. I'm also getting some dark chocolate and oak in the flavor. The finish is a bit warm but not abrasive in any way. The beer is very thick and covers your mouth. The carbonation is creamy and smooth. Overall I really enjoyed this one. It's a good use of rum barrel aging and I'd be happy to have more. 696 charactersoline73, Jan 22, 2013

Released 12/21/12.
Pours an opaque black with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Tiny dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, cookie dough, vanilla, wood, and rum. Taste is much the same with a slightly tart vanilla rum finish. There is a mild amount of roasty bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with an awesome smell and a great set of flavors. 648 charactersUCLABrewN84, Jan 21, 2013

This beer is their Doug’s Original Stout (the "D.O.S." part of the name) aged in Rum barrels (presumably the capital R part of the "RareR").
Score: 97
2012 vintage 500 ml growler from the 12/21/2012 release. Served in a Tyranena snifter glass and enjoyed on 01/17/13.
Appearance: Ink black in color. Pours a thin layer of mocha-colored head that settles to a ring around the glass. Poor, splotchy lacing that is primarily oily, but average retention. What little lacing and oil clings slowly oozes down the side, back into the glass. 4/5
Smell: Vanilla, fudge and milk chocolate. Behind that is a sweet rum backbone that gets a little more prominent towards the tail end of a whiff. Oak too. Some roastiness and a little dark fruit. Hint of cherry. 4.75/5
Taste: The sweet rum is a lot more "forward" on the palate than in the nose, but it is deliciously incorporated. The first flavor to hit you is the rum, followed shortly thereafter by a wave of vanilla and fudge. This is then followed by a wave of dark fruit, brown sugar and faint milk chocolate. Finishes with lingering vanilla and fudge. There is some bold "boozy flavor," but no "booziness." Slightly sweet overall. 4.75/5
Mouthfeel: Not quite full-bodied, low carbonation. Rich and creamy on the palate. Finishes dry, but not quite "chalky." 4.5/5
Overall: This is a baby Churchill's Finest Hour 2012 with sweet rum and cherry characteristics. Holy wow! I love how rich and complex this brew is.
Recommendation: Seek a bottle of this out!
Pairings: French vanilla ice cream.
Cost: $20 for a 500 ml growler. 1,692 charactersjegross2, Jan 18, 2013

A- Pours a very deep black, and has a fairly thick appearance. A healthy mocha color head appears, and reduces to a light ring of foam around the ring of the glass. A little swirl leaves a nice spotty lacing around the glass.
S- A ton of roasted malt and dark fruits. A bit of boozy oakiness, but somewhat hard to distinguish the exact alcohol type from the nose alone.
T- Very smooth and creamy, transitions to lots of dark fruity notes and rum. It is rich and a bit sweet, but almost has a tartness about it(perhaps from the rum). The flavors work together extremely well though, and the base beer is big enough to stand up to the strength of the barrel.
M- Very nice. Thick and heavy, without being overboard. The carbonation was spot on too, especially from a swing top that is a few weeks old now. 
O- I was very excited to try this beer, and I have to say it met my expectations. I'd be curious to try the bourbon, as I think it would be more up my alley. The rum comes of a bit harsh at times, but is still very delicious. This beer has depth, and I'd gladly drink more of these. Could only imagine it is even better on tap. 1,199 charactersGfunk720, Jan 18, 2013

A - Pours black with a small film of head, quickly dissipating down to nothing at all, leaving no lace down the glass.
S - Smells of rich chocolate fudge, vanilla, coconut, caramel, toffee, oak, dark roasted malt and spicy rum. Not as much spirit as I was expecting, leaving plenty of room for the base aromas to shine through.
T - Starts off with the fudgey chocolate and smooth vanilla sweetness quickly being joined buy the toffee, caramel, oak, coconut, dark roasted grains and spicy rum bring it all together. Finish is a mix of sweetness and dark roast, combining with some warming booze to linger long after the finish. This is a really well put together beer.
M - Heavy body with moderate carbonation. Smooth feel goes a little watery toward the end of the glass. Booze is well hidden, only really coming forward as it warms up to room temperature.
O - Really solid BA stout. It didn't blow me away by any stretch of the imagination but it really made me want to try the regular Rare DOS. Hope I have that chance one day as I am pretty sure I am going to love it. 1,171 charactersorangesol, Jan 14, 2013

A- Pours a opaque black with a thin mocha head that stays around, though leaving no lacing behind. A really nice looking beer regardless. 
S- Freshly baked fudge brownies, sweetened and fresh coconut, vanilla beans, toffee, rum, peppery spice, and dark fruit with black cherries and plum. 
T- Waves of chocolate throughout with fudge, brownie batter, and dark chocolate. Coconut, toffee, roasted malt, vanilla, rum soaked fruit and spice cake are also present.
M- Light carbonation with a rich, syrupy body. One of the best mouth-feels I've had with a stout. Perfect. 
O- A rich and dense beer with incredible complexity and flavor. Plenty of chocolate sweetness, but never cloying. Simply put, not only one of the best stouts I've had, but one of the best beers I've had period. 906 charactersiadler, Jan 13, 2013

A: Growler was filled up to the very top of the swing-top. Had a small hiss when I opened it...nice. Pours a deep black with very light and quickly fading carbonation. Thick, I was super exicted when I poured this beer...
S: Smell was slightly better than the taste, but as soon as I opened the bottle and even moreso when I poured the beer, strong notes of sweet rum, choc, syrup...all those great dark notes...smelled really complex and nice....even more exicted!
T: First taste...wow!, really smooth, surprisingly no taste of any alcohol, only nice flavors with a mild sweetness....rum, molasses, maybe some figs (i don't want to get to crazy here...It was really good,,,lets just say that!) . I did not rate this a 5 because the flavors did not linger and faded a bit more quickly than I expected. Don't get me wrong, it is awesome!
M: Nice, not overpowering and super-syrupy...very very drinkable!
O: Really, really good. Lots of flavors and tastes! 1,056 characters4thelvofbeer, Jan 12, 2013

The beer pours black as night, motor oil consistency out of the growler, hues of dark brown around the rim of the glass when struck by the light, a thin fizzy caramel colored head appears for a brief moment but recedes into nothingness almost immediately. A touch of film does remain on top of the beer, but there is no apparent lacing as it goes down. The aroma is nice, dark chocolate, charred wood, roasted coffee jump out with a nice smooth lingering rum presence with a touch of sharp fusel alcohol, the nose isn't overly complex but very balanced and inviting. The flavors, however, are truly wonderful. Nice dark chocolate cake flavor with a smooth coffee touch greats the tongue right off the bat with a great wood character, a nice layer of cherry and raisin that leads to a fantastically smooth rum finish with just the faintest vanilla notes lingering behind. The flavors are so perfectly balanced, wonderfully integrated and brilliantly complex, each sip brings out some great nuances that really take this beer to a new level. The body is wonderful, impressively smooth, rich, full bodied and leaves a nice warming sensation as it goes down.
Verdict: A truly inspired beer, the complexity is superb and the smooth body is absolutely fantastic. For anyone who loves a great stout or barrel aged beer, this is a must have. 1,427 characterskevanb, Jan 12, 2013

A: Pours a blackish-brown coffee color with a small tan head. Glugs out of the growler viscously.
S: Richly sweet caramel and molasses, woody, a bit of herbal rum character, marshmallow. Alcohol notes mix with the sweetness.
T: Not quite as sweet as the nose, with some dry roasted malt and tannins, cocoa, light vanilla and toffee. The rum lends some green nuttiness to the beer which doesn't show up in whiskey barrel-aged beers.
M: Thick-bodied with very light carbonation.

Roasted malts, caramel, barrels, and booze all combine to create an incredible BA stout profile. Complex, yet smooth and damn near sessionable. Superbly refined; demonstrates an utter mastery of the brewing process. Bravo. 501 charactersbrystmar, Jan 09, 2013

Very deep dark rich nose. Very bold but I wouldn't say incredibly complex. Muted dark chocolate, a touch of soy sauce, dark fruit and molasses. 
Flavor on the other hand is incredibly complex. A huge range of flavor and a little different from many stouts if its kinds. Notes of graham, chocolate, mocha. It changes quite a bit from beginning to end resembling a range of desserts like tiramisu. 
Mouth is full bodied and sticky with a low and creamy carbonation. 
Overall this is a phenomenal beer. The only downfall is the nose which is pretty much one note, but the flavor makes up for everything. No booziness or alcohol present. This will not get better than it is now. Drink fresh as recommended. 809 charactersMrVonzipper, Jan 08, 2013

A: Very dark, looks black except around the rim where it appears as very dark brown. Minimal visible carbonation, and forms a ring of brown foam. Essentially opaque.
S: Big roasted malt, chocolate, a bit of coffee, raisins, oaky, boozy (rum). Really an amazingly deep, rich aroma.
T: Follows the nose. Chocolate, oak, booze/rum, dark fruit, raisins (prunes maybe?). The drying tannins mesh so well with the sweet malt. Great flavor. I did not appreciate any coconut flavor that many others have noticed.
M: Smooth creamy mouthfeel, heavy-bodied, and only moderate alcohol for the style - the barrel-aging doesn't seem overdone. Low carbonation.
O: Hype aside, this is really, really good. Very well done. 784 charactersmacrosmatic, Jan 06, 2013

A- Pours an opaque jet black with hardly any head but decent carbonation and some alcohol legs that form along the sides of the glass when sloshed around a bit.
S- Nice balance of rum, malts, chocolate, fairly aromatic but nothing ridiculously so. Very nice rum balance.
T- Rum, a hint of oak, light bitter chocolate, nice smooth rum finish. Nicely balanced with an excellent integration of rum barrel aging that doesn't dominate too much but adds a nice flavor to the beer.
M- Smooth, very drinkable, absolutely no alcohol burn, light carbonation. I don't know what the abv is but it is extremely drinkable but you can definitely feel it.
O- This was an excellent barrel-aged stout however I think it is a little bit over-hyped. There was an excellent use of barrel-aging with a very nice amount of rum and a smooth quality to the beer however I would have liked the base beer to be slightly more robust and present itself with a bit more flavor. Overall I enjoyed this beer a lot and it is one of my favorite barrel-aged stouts, but probably not my favorite. I highly recommend trying it, but maybe not going all out in trying to obtain it. 1,256 charactersjaasen64, Jan 06, 2013

Huge thanks to jefe for this one. Got this one today and opened immediately since its a growler. I've heard these guys hold up but why wait right? Part of my new years resolution was drink better beer haha.
500ml growler into 2 eclipse snifters
A- looked exactly how I expected, huge and dark with a very small head. Deep dark brown. Light brown ring around the glass.
S- smell is huge, the rum comes out all over and suites the stout perfectly. Chocolate covered raisin! Some fudge. As it warms the rum becomes huge!
T- huge chocolate upfront, rum raisins. Stout works together perfectly with the rum. Rum becomes huge as it warms. This is one of the best run treatments I've had to date. If your a fan of rum you'll be a big fan of this one. 
M- mouthfeel is a lot thinner than I was expecting, but still a bit of heft. Nowhere near like the other Florida brewer. 
O- this is a very good beer, it's done very well. I do feel this ones reputations precedes itself, but of you get the chance take it. Maybe its making it more concrete that I'm a whiskey bourbon fellow rather than a rum guy. I can see the bourbon beong off the scale!

When poured into my Smuttynose snifter a bronze colored head appears for a short visit and quickly settles to a very think ring of foam. The beer is a very glossy, almost metallic deep brown color. No lace so speak of. Just looks slick.
Very interesting aroma. Lightly sweet with some spice and some dark chocolate. A bit later I was getting some coconut which really added a nice dimension.
Chocolate is center stage here with coconut playing in the background. While I don’t think I could have spotted Rum without knowing, there is definitely a bit of the spice that comes from a Rum. So the notes are definitely there. A touch of brown sugar here along with a touch of black pepper.
Mouthfeel is really interesting here. Very smooth and while bold in body, it’s so soft. My favorite Imp Stouts all have a thicker body and this is no exception, but it has such rounded soft edges it’s great.
Really a wonderful beer. As it warms it opens into something very special. 1,067 charactersReagan1984, Jan 03, 2013

Dark black pour, thick and opaque, with a small cap of chocolate head that sank to a ringlet, leaving oily lacing on the glass. Still looks nice for being a week old. Aroma of dark malts, more sweet than roasty, chocolate, rum and vanilla, dark brown sugar. All of this translated into the taste, dark chocolate, smooth malt richness, vanilla, rum-soaked oak, caramel and a hint of butterscotch. Contrary to other reviews, I didn't really get any coconut out of this. Rich and full in body, smooth and velvety, lower carbonation, ABV seemed pretty high, I'm guessing 10+%, but as with Peg's stouts in general, there was basically no alcohol heat whatsoever. Amazing beer overall.
Honestly I don't get too much of a different effect from whiskey barrel aging and rum barrel aging in beers, especially big beers like this one, but I like both, so it's good either way. I'd like to have been able to try the Rare DOS as well, but it just wasn't to be. Maybe some other time. Hopefully. 1,094 charactersRifugium, Dec 30, 2012

A: Pours a jet black with a thin brown head, that stays very persistent for quite some time along the edge of the glass. It kept it's carb very well over the last 8 days in the growler. I half expected it to be flat. As we drink, we notice a fantastic lacing that remains on the sides of the glass. Just beautiful. 
N: The nose really shines with this beer. Absolutely amazing. Notes of chocolate, sweet milk, toffee, and a very understated vanilla notes. The sweet sugar cane rum aroma rises as this liquid gold warms. 
T: Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful. The palate has more roast notes than the nose would indicate. Very well melded flavors of chocolate, brown sugar/rum, some mild vanilla, dark roast notes. Excellent and very unique toasted coconut and beautiful rum profile.
M: The mouthfeel is what really brings this stout to the next level. It's so silky, I'm super impressed. It's got a very thick feeling, but the carbonation is surprising, and supports that thick feeling well. 
Drink and Overall: This beer really lives up to the hype. It's an amazing stout, and after having Rare DOS on tap as well, I believe the two are pretty close to one another in terms of quality. Awesome beer. 1,416 charactersMarcatGSB, Dec 29, 2012

A Flat black pour that's pretty much opaque except for thinner areas. Pretty much no head at all which leads to no lacing.
S Big time barrel. Sweet dark fruits, vanilla, sweet not hot alcohol (Bourbon? Rum?) Smells amazing
T Sweetness from front to back but not cloying. Vanilla, burnt sugars, chocolate, integrated bourbon, coconut and a bit of heat. Each sip is great and specific flavors can be found when looking for them. Top notch stout that lives up to the hype.
M Heavy feel like a Zhukov with very little carbonation. Big chewy and viscous, im curious what the final gravity was.

Thanks to Rich for opening this. Bottle into a snifter.
Near black with some auburn highlights. Big light brown head. The aroma brings to mind cocoa and toffee with a great blend of cinnamon and vanilla. Lots of dark chocolate and fudge and a little rum character. Light alcohol. In the flavor I find brown sugar with a subtle rum presence. There's an interesting cinnamon chili pepper note in there with ample fudge. Smooth rum fudge oak finish. Well hidden alcohol. The mouthfeel is chewy, sticky, and silky with a full body and a medium level of carbonation. Overall, this is very good. We tried this next to the batch of Rare Dos that was released at the same time, whenever that was, and it was quite a bit better. Though, the Rare Dos we tried was noticeably inferior to other batch I tried and reviewed in the middle of 2011. Highly Recommended. 865 charactersHopHead84, Oct 31, 2012

Just a nonchalant here give this a try as he slides a snifter infront of me and then proceeds to treat everyone else sitting at the bar with a sample. I had no idea what I was drinking until all but the last sip remained. 
The brew appeared black in color with a thin, tight tan cap sitting across the top. As it faded, it produced spotty lacing on the glass. When held to the light, a thin ruby brown clarity can be seen around the edges.
The smell was rich of coconut, raison sweetness blending into a soft touch of alcohol. The roast of the grain imparts a smell of dark chocolate, licorice and almost a hint of spicy menthol coolness. It was obvious this was barrel aged but the light spice inclusion had me scratching my head. 
The flavor of this brew strikes with caramel and toasty coconut and toffee with vanilla all from the barrel againg. Before your palate has an opportunity to register "sweet" in your brain, a flavor of roast like espresso and bitter chocolate come out and are well pronounced mid-palate. A bit more vanilla and spice almost like raw oak but not quite increase in perception as the brew warms up.
This was a heavier bodied brew, almost chewy with a light level of carbonation. Super smooth and easy drinking as even the guy beside me stated outloud "jesus this is smooth for a dark beer." A fantastic sipper to say the least. What a joy and unexpected surprise to get to try this beer. Doug mentioned that perhaps this was held on to for too long and it was starting to fall off a bit. Are you serious? I can only imagine what this brew was like when it was fresh. 1,699 charactersstakem, Sep 07, 2012

Appearance - Quite black with a nice dark khaki/mocha head. Sticky without much retention.
Smell - Barrel notes. vanilla and oak. Rum is secondary, which is good because I don't love the rum aroma. Good chocolate behind everything. Really smells quite wonderful.
Taste - Rum is definitely more prominent in the taste. Sweet rum flavor with less barrel. Some vanilla and oak, but mostly rum. Chocolate and some bitterness. Good finish from the stout, but the rum lingers for a bit too long making it seem hot.
Mouthfeel - Tingly alcohol without being too boozy. Low carbonation. The lingering rum flavor is a bit unpleasant, though.
Overall - I don't think this is anywhere near as good as Rare DOS, but I'm in the minority. I find that the rum detracts more than it adds. 852 charactersAlieniloquium, Jul 14, 2012

Opaque dark brown pour. A finger of brown crust forms and slowly recedes to a collar.
Smells like there's a low level infection. Chocolate brownies, coconut, butter, coffee, lactic sourness. Sweet rum barrel notes pop out as it warms. It's not bad despite the slight sourness and diacetyl.
Palate is sweet and chocolatey, slightly tart, buttery. Big coconut character and a touch of rum. Mouthfeel is silky and full. Not much actual oak flavor. Finish is slick and buttery without much roast.
Shame about the infection, I can tell this would be great stuff otherwise. 586 characterslargadeer, Jul 01, 2012

Enjoyed on 11 May 2012
Thanks for this RareR tasty brew Johndoe8!
A: The abyss of black. Thin layer of soft mocha bubbles for a head. Thick motor oil consistency.
S: Smells of rum, sweet caramel, dark chocolate, and vanilla. Beautiful nose and quite inviting!
T: Complex and deep. Follows nose closely, but the rum is a bit more muted. Not too sweet - the vanilla balances the dark chocolate and caramel nicely. Notes of coconut and oak add to the enjoyable complexity of this beer and everything is intertwined to perfection.
M: Full bodied with gentle carbonation. Thick and coating, but very smooth.
O: Simply put...this beer is amazing! I'll leave it at that. 705 charactersspdyfire83, Jun 30, 2012

Thanks to Aaron and co. for dragging me out of my study den and making me have an awesome time. You guys rock. This beer poured pitch black. It's a black hole. A deep abyss that sports a milk chocolate brown head that dares you to disturb it. So I did. And holy shit, this beer is SMOOTH. That's the first thing that came to my head. All the flavors are wonderfully melded together. Toffee, toasted marshmallows, caramel, figs/raisins, coffee, dark chocolate, it's all there. Follow that with a nice boozy rum presence and oak. This is where it's at guys. Big body, excellent carbonation. Word. 614 charactersDmanGTR, May 31, 2012

The pour is a molasses black with almost no head. 
There is a boozines in the aroma. Rum, roasted malt, dark chocolate, molasses, coconut, and a bit of vanilla all come through in the nose.
The flavor is so incredibly smooth. It starts with a light sweetness, both from the rum and the roasted malt. Dark bitter chocolate, espresso and milk along with more rum. It is sweet, chocolately, smooth, and full of character, which only grows as the sip goes on. Toward the end of the sip, coconut, vanilla, and sweeter milk chocolate dominate more.
The carbonation is light in appearance, but there is a medium carbonation and nice smoothness when I drink it. There is full body and a smoothness that just blows me away.
This was pretty incredible. A slight knock in the appearance and a light smell intensity were the only things that really brought it down. 915 charactersKickInTheChalice, May 16, 2012

4.67/5  rDev +4.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to Steve for sharing. 16oz growler #25. Served in a Närke snifter.
A - A thin mocha foam settles to a thin ring and a few wisps, leaving behind tiny specks of lace. Black body, and an oily glass-coating brown film that lingers upon consumption.
S - Massive notes of butterscotch, coconut, dark chocolate, molasses, brownies, and the lightest touch of rum. Surprisingly little oak here - guessing the rum barrel was re-used a few times before ending up in Doug's hands. In any case, even with the understated barrel and spirit presence this is still quite excellent, as the base stout is formidable in its own right. Minimal alcohol presence.
T - As with Rare D.O.S. the taste is a revelation, with waves of molten milk and dark chocolates, vanilla, coconut, caramel, molasses, and a kiss of rum and oak. Super rich and smooth, with flavors that linger nearly indefinitely. Again, virtually no alcohol to be found. Probably a 4.75 in comparison to Rare D.O.S., but stellar in its own right.
M - Smooth, molten chocolate texture, medium-full body, lower carbonation, and perhaps a touch of alcohol warmth on the back of the throat. Lightly dry barrel presence in the finish.
D - Excellent stuff. Doesn't quite hit the highs of Rare D.O.S., but it's pretty close. Greatly looking forward to trying this again in the near future. 1,338 charactersMasterSki, May 08, 2012

4.72/5  rDev +5.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Cam rules! Enjoyed side-by-side with Rare DOS.
Pours a very dark brownish color with a cocoa head. A bit oily as it swirls the glass. The nose is really good on this beer - sweetness blends nicely with the slight spiciness and the flavors of the barrel. The taste is heavenly, rivaling the very best BA imperial stouts I have ever had. The up front sweetness, the booziness in the middle and the tannic finish of rare DOS have all be knocked back into balance and then elevated by the flavors of the rum. The beer is sweet, but not overly so, flavorful, yet smooth. This beer was clearly made for rum barrels. The mouthfeel is solid with appropriate carbonation. Overall, this beer is just fantastic and worth every effort to acquire. Many hyped beers don't live up to expectations - this one exceeded mine. 808 charactersseeswo, Apr 10, 2012
4.65/5  rDev +3.8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a Dark reddish brown. Much like rare dos but oilier and thicker. Smells sweet and candied like rare dos but with just a hint of rum peaking through. The aroma is down right phenomenal. Tastes sweet and malty. Chocolate, hnt of roast, and then rum... Some spice and booziness as well as lots of oak from the barrel. A bit flatter than rare dos but overall great mouthfeel. To me this is a superior beer to rare dos and definitely worth trying if you are lucky enough to stop at pegswhenit is available 506 charactersUrbancaver, Apr 06, 2012

Reviewed from notes.
A: Pours an inky black that fades to a gentle ruby on the very edges of the glass. Touches of deep burgundy shimmer out in the light. Half finger of light tan head that rapidly settles down to a thin sheen. Minimal lacing. 
S: Goodness gracious. Possibly the best stout I have ever had the pleasure of dipping my nose into. The only other thing I can even think of that comes close is GI Rare. So many things going on here...chocolate, molasses, vanilla, oak, raisin, plum, and even some melon. Hints of tobacco emerge from the background as it warms. Rich, decadent, and absolutely delightful. Unbelievable.
T: Chocolate, coconut, dark fruit, leather. Really impressive coconut on this...it's quite assertive, but doesn't overwhelm. Pretty good amount of vanilla as well. What's most surprising is how refined the barrel (and rum) character is on this. The wood is not very apparent on this, only serving to augment rather than overwhelm. And the rum takes on almost a bourbon like quality, only imparting some delicate, light fruitiness instead of the gross, Malibu, pina colada quality I have found in lesser rum barrel aged stouts. This is amazing.
M: Perfect. Low carbonation, full bodied, spectacular complexity and shows you a new flavor every sip. Nice coating mouthfeel, thick and delicious.
O: I have many more stouts to go before I can declare this the best ever, but I can't recall having had something more delicious than this, except possibly GI Rare. An outstanding experience top to finish. Cannot thank you enough, Rhett, for this ridiculous treat. 1,714 characterssiege06nd, Apr 05, 2012

4.67/5  rDev +4.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Growler #11 split two ways. 
Deep dark brown with ruby highlights around the edge, thin milk chocolate head. Smells of molasses, burnt brown sugar, chocolate, spiced dark rum, and wood. Taste is more of the same, not as sweet as a most whiskey barrel aged beers. It has a little more spice lent from the rum barrel and a nice fudgy chocolate taste. Mouthfeel is chewy, with light carbonation and an excellent finish. This was a great beer, and I really wish more people would age their beers in rum barrels! I can't wait for the chance to try Rare DOS as well. 560 charactersxpimptastikx, Mar 26, 2012
4.97/5  rDev +10.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Huge thanks to Rhettroactive for surprising us with this gem this evening. Bottle #21 poured from a 16oz swingtop into my Devil's Backbone tulip. It poured thick and black with a thin tan head clinging to edges of glass. Very dark and inviting. 
The aroma has a very rich chocolate and toasted coconut flavor to it. Its a little like a dark chocolate and coconut brownie. A little boozy rum is there, bit it integrates very well. Very rich and sweet, a little desert like but really awesome aroma overall.
The taste shows a lot of toasted coconut and dark bittersweet chocolate. A little more of the rum is there but again really integrates and compliments well. Caramelized brown sugar and vanilla come out in the finish. I got a little more dark fruits as it warmed. So smooth and rich.
Mouthfeel thick and creamy with low carbonation. The slickness really is awesome and very fitting.
Overall it was a really fantastic beer. It was so smooth and rich. I loved the toasted coconut and vanilla flavors. Wow, this was an amazing beer. The rum barrel gave it some fantastic qualities that really sets it apart from the standard Bourbon barrel beers of the style. The barrel aging was perfectly done as well, so well integrated and complimenting. This really wasn't even on my radar because I've never really had any rum barrel beers that have impressed me, but this one completely blew me away tonight. This is definitely worthy of mention among the elite few top of the style for me. 1,487 charactersbillab914, Mar 26, 2012

*From notes
-- An epic thanks to SturgisPodmore for trading me this gem of a beer --
Growler # 21 of 25
A: Tarpit blackish-brown. Pouring it straight down the center of the glass yields a thin .25 finger head. It fades quickly, leaving a layer of creamy streaks across the top of the beer. A thin off-white collar remains. And I should note that this sucker just coats the glass as I swirl it ever so slightly.
S: Spectacular doesn't begin to describe it. A masterful balance of alcohol esters, spirit notes and sweet liquid brownie batter smother my nostrils. The coconut and hints of vanilla bean are outstanding.
T: Unimaginably delicious. I don't care how rare it is - I promise that even if this was a year-round shelf offering, it would be just about the tastiest God damn beer I've ever consumed. So incredibly decadent and rich. The concentration here is simply out of bounds, as it reminds me of some of the best California cult cabs. Like Screaming Eagle is to wine, this is to beer.
The fore is melted dark chocolate, it just oozes all over my palate. The mid showcases red fruit - plums, ripe cherries and a touch of late harvest dark berries. The rum and spirit profile hits on the back, but it comes across more like a bourbon barrel, as it's overflowing with toasted vanilla bean and fresh coconut skin. There's also a deep through line of cane sugar, which rides from beginning to end, and it sticks to my lips and tongue as I soak it all in. The finish....oh, the finish. It lingers inside my mouth for ages - I can literally taste it for over ten minutes without a return trip to my glass. Wihtout question, this stands as one of the finest things I've ever had the pleasure imbibing.
M: Like the finest linens covering the finest bed in the finest Rain Man suite in Las Vegas. This is dense and massively creamy, yet it's apporachable and extraordinarily easy to put back. Smooth, luscious and elegant beyond compare.
O: The whole room went silent as we took our notes, imbibing what ultimately is the best beer I have ever quaffed. I genuinely assumed that there was no possible way that RareR DOS would live up to the mammoth hype that it or Rare DOS have received. Yet to be blunt: it did....and then some.

4.89/5  rDev +9.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5The rarest beer I will probably ever have. Thanks so much Rhett for your generosity!
A: Dark chocolate brown with minimal head. Swirls of light cream on top. 
S: Smells delicious. Waves of vanilla and wood at the forefront. Subsides a bit into some dark fruits, plum, prune, raisin. Hints of blackstrap molasses throughout but not dominant. The booze melds well but smells more like bourbon than rum although some of the good sipping rum I've had from Central America smells similar. I smelled it at least 20 times before a taste but smelled more coconut and chocolate at the end. Unrivaled balance.
T: The rum comes out a better on the taste. Rich chocolate, vanilla, brown sugar. Like a rich dessert, melted brownie with a rum glaze. A bit of lactic acidity and tastes of wood provide an interesting counterpoint that is a bit different from everything else, providing almost a dry finish. Delicious.
M: This beer is the epitome of creamy. Melts in your mouth. A little sticky and dry on the finish but this is nitpicking.
O: This is one of the best beers I have ever had. Off the top of my head, GI Rare would give this a good cage match. This is a delicious treat that I enjoyed to every sip. I hope to be able to try the Rare DOS someday but if it is anything close to this, it will be an accomplishment. 1,314 charactersIrishColonial, Mar 25, 2012
4.75/5  rDev +6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5A- Black with a very small tan head. Growler is 13 days old, so not sure if there would have been a more noticeable head earlier.
S- Molasses, vanilla, caramel.
T- Sweet at first, definite brown sugar/molasses flavor. The rum comes in later on. Very complex, great flavor
M- Very smooth. Medium to full body.
O - I have not tried the normal rare dos, but this was a pretty perfect beer to me. Reminded me of some of the BCBS variants I recently had at Stout Fest. I am really happy I was able to trade for a growler of this. 528 characterskif, Mar 23, 2012
4.67/5  rDev +4.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Picked up the bottle / growler at Peg's at the release. Served in a Peg's snifter just because I'm greatest there ever was.
Beer is black with a thin tan head of small bubbles, low carbonation, no lacing, some legs on the glass and it is coated with the thickness of the beer in the swirl. 
Aroma is perfect, cannot improve anymore, I saved the last bit in my glass just so I can carry it around the rest of the night smelling it. Strong liquor character but I don't smell much rum, smells more like whiskey to me, someone suggested that it does smell like dark rum, perhaps. Still smells amazing. Illogical, woody, sweet, vanilla, tannin, oak, booze....yum.
Beer is medium to big in body, smooth on the palate, sweet up front, nice liquor flavors in the middle, as good as Rare was I think, great mouthfeel, mild bitterness from grain at the end. A very good beer. I'd definitely have this again. 900 charactersdrabmuh, Mar 21, 2012
4.74/5  rDev +5.8%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5500 mL growler. Number 13 of 25. Served in a Peg's snifter. Poured by a Cicerone Certified Beer Server.
Pours a viscous dark brown with clear ruby tinges in the edges with a fleeting khaki head and a few wisps of lace. Aroma is perfect, or so says the last 15 minutes I've spent smelling this beer without tasting it. Incredibly balanced and rich nose of vanilla, molasses, rum, bourbon, candi sugar, light oak and angel's tears. Flavor is not quite as transcendental as Rare was, but this is still exceptional. As it warms the rum becomes more dominant, with raisin, plum, caramel and light oak supporting a strong vanilla and molasses barrel presence. Syrupy, thick viscous body with very low carbonation. Aroma and flavor lingers forever after the glass is finished. The flavor didn't match the aroma and all around this experience didn't match Rare, but that said, I still enjoyed this infinitely more than recently sampled Dark Lord and Hunhapu variants. 960 charactersyourefragile, Mar 18, 2012

Pours black with a thick tan head and fairly nice retention. A thin collar as it goes down. 
The nose carries a beautiful combination of dark fruits, molasses, rum, vanilla, chocolate, and sweet malt. Light coconut in the background. Absolutely gorgeous. Only rivaled by Rare D.O.S. the flavor continues on the same path and it does not disappoint. Just incredible integration between all the components. The barrel character is so smooth. Unreal.
Body is full and viscous, though not quite to the level of Rare D.O.S., which is pretty much my only complaint. So chewy and full. No alcohol at all. Simply an amazing beer. 767 charactersThorpe429, Mar 18, 2012

I don't have a Peg's glass like the other guys, but they let me have some anyhow.
The beer is dark brown with a small and fleeting beige head. The aroma brings a huge dose of bourbon, followed by some vanilla, oak, roast and chocolate. The flavor is simply fabulous. World class. Well balanced and just teeming with flavor. I am getting much more bourbon flavor than rum. Perhaps dark rum adds some molasses and dark fruit flavors. Complex, wonderful, sippable, chuggable. What can I say? A+ 544 charactersHuhzubendah, Mar 18, 2012

A - Gorgeous black beer with a nice brown head. Had great retention. Some minor spots left on the sides.
S - Carmel, chocolate, just a touch of brown sugar and coconut. The rum barrel adds some really nice spice and sweetness characteristics without blowing the beer up. Have not gotten this from most rum barrel aged beers yet, as most of them have just been bad and/or infected.
T - Rum was a great addition to this. Nice rum, chocolate, brown sugar, and barrel. Not sure how stiff this is, but the beer is quite smooth and doesn't suffer from any heat. Great big stout flavors with a bit of a spicey twist to it.
M - Smooth, full, moderate carbonation.
O - Liked this better than the new batch of Rare D.O.S. Speaking of which, Rare D.O.S. one of the best beers I've ever drank, but in having it fresh I realized it's one that gets a lot better with age. This on the other hand, was good to go. Awesome taste, manages to be a nice big stout with a bit of unique character from the Rum barrel. 1,053 charactersAgentZero, Mar 15, 2012

A - Pours black, mocha head, thin collar, spotty lace, wisps.
S - Smooth booze, chocolate (milk/dark/bakers), light caramel, excellent level of rum notes in there too. It's very easy to pick out the rum version versus the regular Rare DOS and it's cool to have them side-by-side.
T - Rum, chocolate, vanilla, burnt sugars, excellent barrel character. The booze is just oh-so-smooth and enjoyable and just to my liking. I think the rum adds something else to this beer instead of taking away from the base Rare DOS. Really just outstanding stuff.
M - Full, rich and smooth, nice subtle carbonation, creamy finish.
O - I have to say, this is slightly better then Rare DOS for me. The rum barrel really adds another layer to this beer, even though I didn't think it was possible. Not sure if I'll ever have it again, but hey, my fingers are crossed! 896 charactersSean9689, Mar 12, 2012
