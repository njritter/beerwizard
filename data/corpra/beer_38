Poured a bright orange with a modest creamy head that dissipated to less than an eighth of an inch quickly.  The smell is an awesome tropical pine.  The taste is a well balanced tropical hop bomb with hints of tropical sweetness and bitter pine that could not be any better balanced.  The taste carries through to a delicious finish with intense mouth retention.  The brew is not too thin and almost feels sticky on the lips.  A wonderful IPA. 501 charactersflaskman, Jul 07, 2017

Poured a golden orange color with just over a fingers worth of foamy white head. The smell was full of tropical fruits, pine and grass. The flavor profile follows he nose, great balance of fruit and pine! The feel is medium with good carbonation. Overall I can see why everyone rates this beer so highly. I have been waiting a long time to try it so when I saw it on tap in New York I had to jump on it. You should too if you see it anywhere. 495 charactersMeyers1023, Jul 03, 2017

As a relic of pre-NE IPA days, I'm not surprised this one looks fantastic. Goldenrod color, great head, awesome lace. Nose is pine, citrus, pineapple and grass. Surprisingly mellow with a nice sweetness. Beer opens pineapple, citrus and honeydew. Waves of tropical fruit flavor are balanced by a grassy, piney hop bitterness. A touch of cane sugar and more pineapple in the middle with an aggressive hop bite at the end. Great balance. Very drinkable. Body is light to medium with moderate carbonation. Foamy and prickly on the palate and goes down aggressive with a clean, dry finish. Excellent. 
A real balanced beer overall. This one doesn't wow you off the bat but it lends itself to be appreciated more and more after every sip. 799 charactersSpeedwayJim, Jul 01, 2017

Well, first, you have to jump into Mr. Peabody & Sherman's W.A.B.A.C. Machine, going back to the early-to-mid-1970's. There, a youthful Bro. Woody spent a LOT of time on his maternal grandparents' property, abutting a working farm. A young neighbor girl traded comic books & played tetherball with me. She grew up, married a fellow local beer aficionado & during a recent road trip to VT, they knew to bring me CANs! Viva The CANQuest (tm)! It pays to advertise. 
From the CAN: "Lawson’s Finest Liquids is a small artisanal brewery located in Warren, Vermont, producing an array of hop-forward ales, specialty maple beers and unique creations. Sip of Sunshine IPA is brewed by Lawson’s Finest Liquids at Two Roads Brewing Co. in Stratford CT. Lean more by visiting lawsonsfinest.com."; "This lupulin-ladin India Pale Ale is packed with juicy tropical fruit character, bright floral aromas, and delectable layers of hop flavor. Pour mindfully, inhale deeply, and enjoy a tropical vacation in a glass. Always store cold, enjoy fresh and stay cool!"; "Keep Cold! Enjoy Fresh!" 
A mindful pour? What does that involve? The mindfulness of the local giving my friend a hard time because the beer is brewed & CANned at Two Roads? Snobbery at its finest.
I listened to the joyful Crack! as I opened the CAN & after mindful CANsideration, I employed a very gentle Glug. I hearkened to the angelic singing of cherubs as I filled my glass with this elusive elixir. I began to employ an in-glass swirl, but there was no need - its fecund effervescence raised a finger of dense, foamy, bone-white head with excellent retention of its own accord. Color was Golden-Amber (SRM = > 5, < 7) with NE-quality clarity & of course, The Gelt Gang of Mammon, Midas & Croesus showed up for a taste. I think that the whole neighborhood might have shown up if they had known what I was drinking today! I inhaled deeply and realized that the nose was very fruity, very tropical, but in this case, rather than putting me in mind of Tropical Fruit Life Savers, I was reminded more of JuicyFruit gum. Mmm. Mouthfeel was big & thick, like a dollop on my tongue and in my mouth. I just let it loll about, rolling it back and forth as I savored my tropical staycation. The taste was bright and clean, tropical fruity initially, followed by a blast of grapefruit citrusiness. It had a bitterness, to be sure, but not like some that I have imbibed recently in which the dry hopping was a bit too close to saturation. This managed to strike that fine balance between allowing the hops to Shine while still creating a high-ABV beer through the use of additional malts, which CAN likewise increase the sweetness. I noticed that as it warmed, the tropical fruit flavors really returned with a vengeance, pushing the pushy grapefruit citrusiness out of the way. Finish was dry, but not gaspingly so. I do not know when, if ever, I will have this again, so I took my time with it, savoring every Sip of this liquid Sunshine. 3,144 characterswoodychandler, Jun 26, 2017

I hate to be That Guy but I feel a little something has been lost, mostly in the aroma and mouthfeel categories. But let's face it: at $14.99 a 4-pack for such a complex, flavorful IPA, it's still head and shoulders above the grand majority of canned brews. Great mix of lupulin and biscuit crispness. IMO best served cold; I think it suffers a bit as it warms. 470 charactersjpbrooklyn, Jun 26, 2017

Pours a light amber with slightly less haziness than other top NEDIPA's.
Nose is juicy citrus fruits but not too strong.
Taste - man oh man.  Outstanding.  Not a hint of the high abv.  Nice bitterness on the front end and elements of papaya, citrus rind, peach follows. Smooth finish.
Mouthfeel not as silky smooth as Treehouse or Trillium, but I think I prefer it that way in the summer.  Refreshing.
In my opinion, this is a top ten DIPA, right up there with HT and Julius.  Will be making the run to Vt. 555 characterscrotharagain, Jun 18, 2017

4.24/5  rDev -7%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25The appearance had a hazy glossy orange color with a one finger white foamy head that dissipated within less than thirty seconds leaving some light speckled to semi-spider web lacing. The smell had a full bittersweet citrus hops with a light underscore of piney hops, graced by a big sweet sticky freshly cut grass and as it opens up, the citrus opens up to lean towards the grapefruit. The taste balanced extremely nicely between the bitter citrus and piney hops to the sweet freshly cut grass. Sticky sweet grapefruit to grassy aftertaste leads to a wet citrus finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a great sessionability about it. I’d want to pound this on a hot Summer’s day. Overall, I say this was an exceptionally wonderful DIPA that I would love to have again. 811 charactersLone_Freighter, Jun 05, 2017

Pours clear gold with an average head and retention. Surprising clarity. Aromatics lead off with melon, mango, tangerine, and pineapple. Medium bodied with a crisp mouthfeel. Ripe tropical citrus on the palate with a fairly big bitterness. Dry and bitter with some faint malt to balance. Finishes with a sustaining bitterness, citrus pith, and faint pine.
Tasty enough but the hops in this one (especially the nose) are subdued. The first time I had this it was on draft it was much juicier and cloudy. Hard to imagine this beer has fallen off this much in just a couple of weeks? Doesn't hold a candle to Trillium and certainly disappointing for a $18.00 4 pack. 688 charactersbrewandbbq, Apr 30, 2017

This kind of taste is best described as slightly sweet, slightly minty, slightly grassy, and all the way smooth. The body is what defines this beer though - leaves what could be a train wreck dancing across the palette. Well done, really unique beer. Don't rope this in with the others. Restraints is its best trait. 429 characterssoze47, Apr 27, 2017

The taste is more rounded, with some biscuit and orange/mango notes, and a bitter twang finish. The feel is smooth, carbonation is medium low, and the heft is medium.

Smell: I'm not getting a ton here. Wondering if my noise is off based on the other reviews. I get some hops, mango, citrus and a hint of lemon, but everything is very faint. 
Taste: solid taste here with a good blend and balance of hops and tropical flavors.

3/22/17 date on can, poured into a Teku glass. Poured a hazy, pale straw color with a laced white head. Honestly, I think the look of this beer is probably it's best feature. The nose was uninspiring; lots of floral and lemon shining through, but faint overall. Going down, a very watery brew, especially for an IIPA. Flavors seemed muddled and lackadaisical, with hints of citra and some pine. Nothing jumped out as far as a taste profile, though, and it finished as watery as it started. Will give another shot, due to the accolades it's received, but it'll be tough to overcome my initial first impression. 695 charactersumichfan, Apr 20, 2017

And yet they don't have scores like this... 
Maybe they are all under-rated, or maybe this one is over-rated. Or maybe both. Regardless, great beer abounds all across America. 444 charactersEdwardAbbey, Apr 16, 2017

This beer hits all of the check marks: a beautiful golden copper color, tropical and citrusy hop aromas, the same flavors on the taste, with that special "dankness" that only the truly world-class IPA's/DIPA's have, the ever-so-slight creamy mouthfeel from a beer that allows the malt base to have that moment.
This is an extraordinary beer. 645 charactersovaltine, Apr 14, 2017

I could smell the tropical fruit aroma as I was pouring the beer which should give an idea how strong of a smell it was. Mango, peach, tangerine, pineapple, slight grapefruit
Taste was good but not as much as I was hoping given the aroma. Decent hop flavor and many of the fruits from the smell were present but felt slightly muted.
Mouthfeel was on target for an IPA. 
Overall a very enjoyable beer but it didn't quite live up to my expectations.  I received this in a BIF (thanks Knicks!) Would not bother trading for this like I would Heady, but would surely pick up a 4 pack if I was in CT. 743 charactersmaxcoinage, Apr 09, 2017

Hops: I will eat my hat if there isn't a ton of Citra used in this
Been wanting to try this since forever, luckily like a thousand cases were sent to DC for CBC.  The 2017 hazy flour quadruple dry hopped IPAs have almost ruined beers like this for me.  Almost!  This thing drinks like it came from San Diego, which isn't a bad thing at all.  Juicy pine character with smack of a bitterness.   As good as it is, this has to be one of the most overhyped beers of all time. 497 charactershoppytobehere, Apr 08, 2017

12 oz. Can
Pours a very nice golden yellowish color, very nice carbonation, with a very nice thick/creamy one-finger off-white head, which leaves some pretty nice sticky lacing behind. The nose is hoppy, slight malt, very nice citrus. The taste is really nice, hoppy, slightly malty, with some citrus. Medium body, ABV is hidden very well. Overall, a very tasty brew.

Poured into a Spigelau IPA glass
A- Orange going maybe to yellow / vail color. Nice aired foam. Almost not carbonated we can see few bubbles floating trough the glass but not a lot. 
S- Tropical fruit, citrus fruit. Also get peach and mango in nose wich I find really nice!
M- Intense hoppiness of course mixed with the citrus fruit previously smelt. Mid mouth taste go into an alcool-sugar ( mango, peach ) mix wich make a complex and perfect balance between the bitterness. The aftertaste stay in mouth a long time wich is appreciable. 
O- A really well balanced IPA beer with strong tropical and citrus lasting aromas. A really good IPA beer that deserve is reputation. Cheers 719 charactersGuillaumeprovost, Mar 31, 2017

Pours slightly hazy medium golden yellow color with a 2 finger fairly dense and fluffy white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice dense foamy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big tangerine, grapefruit, peach, passion fruit, papaya, pineapple, mango, melon, guava, berry, lemon/orange zest, light pepper/pine, honey, lightly toasted biscuit, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of citrus/tropical/fruity hops and moderate bready malt notes; with great strength. Taste of huge tangerine, grapefruit, peach, passion fruit, papaya, pineapple, mango, melon, guava, berry, lemon/orange zest, light pepper/pine, honey, lightly toasted biscuit, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Light-moderate pine/citrus peel/grassy/spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of tangerine, grapefruit, peach, passion fruit, papaya, pineapple, mango, melon, guava, berry, lemon/orange peel, pepper, pine, honey, biscuit, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/tropical/fruity hops and moderate bready malt flavors; with fantastic malt/bitterness balance, and zero lingering hop astringency after the finish. Light-moderate dryness from lingering bitterness, increasing through the glass. Medium carbonation and medium-full body; with a very smooth, creamy/bready/grainy/sticky, and lightly resinous balanced mouthfeel that is great. Touch of rind near the end of the glass. Alcohol is well hidden with a mild warmth lingering after the finish. Overall this is an incredible DIPA. All around fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/tropical/fruity hops and moderate bready malt flavors; very smooth and easy to drink with the balanced bitterness. Super dank/juicy hops with balanced malt sweetness; with just enough dryness to not be overly sweet or astringent on hops. A highly enjoyable offering. 2,053 characterssuperspak, Mar 25, 2017

4.64/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Got the word from a friend that the Brattleboro, VT Co-op had this. Sure enough! Opened/sampled and reviewed on 3/23 Canned date on bottom: 3/7/17
  Only a very gentle haze and lazy stream of bubbles can be seen through this light amber with golden hues liquid. A classic 2" high, clumpy, sea foam looking cap stands proud. Obvious sticky lace left after the fall.
   A blend of caramel sweet malt and tropical fruity notes hits the nose first. An earthy, herbal....gritty scent is obvious, grapefruit, tangy citrus and mellon follow. Besides the big, fruity complexity it is actually very floral, surrounded by a peppery earth aroma. Very nice nose indeed.
  The first slow sip delivers a bit of a surprising spice and pepper bite, much more earthy than I had expected. It was the first thing I smelled, and the herbal, earthy hop bite shines through in the flavor as well. A very crispy, gritty-grains malt taste, very "Farmhouse" esque with bits of golden wheat and tangy, sour malty effects. The hop complexity is very high, delivering a sharp, earthy-bitter bite that quickly mellows to a blend of tropical>citrus>mellon fruity flavor's that all blend together to make a very unique overall flavor spectrum. 
  Double IPA strength at 8 %abv. Is WAY to easy to sip. No problem sipping fast! Rather grainy and full feelung at first with more of a big juicy feel later on. A tangy, earthy citrus flavor lingers for a bit in the aftertaste. 
   The high alpha hops are obvious, they pack an excellent, earthy-bitter punch but is also rounded out by an excellent malt balance that grounds the overall flavor very well. This DIPA draws obvious comparisons to some of the very best, big hop brews I've had recently : Heady Topper, The Green and Space Juice. Sick complexity that is easy to drink, is a new level for the DIPA. 1,828 charactersGratefulBeerGuy, Mar 23, 2017

There's a soft hop derived haze to its golden amber body. Two fingers of paper white head shows off some serious stick. 
It's like a peach and mango creamsicle in a glass. Ripe and sweet tropical fruits are bold but also very soft and rounded. There's a fluffy vanilla edge to it as well. Its creamy texture actually comes through on the nose. It's not all gooshy and round, however. Juicy fruit and pineapple give it a lively tang. 
Mango and papaya come in layers of fleshy, ripe, tropical goodness. The middle is plus sized and peachy. Juicy fruit maintains its tang and transitions well into a fresh, resin forward, piney backing. An outline of biscuit is all that comes from its malt bill. Its perceived bitterness is exceptionally balanced and rounded.
The texture is nothing short of lovely. Creamy and clean. Dry on its edges with a perfectly rendered level of bitterness. The 8% ABV hides in the shadows of the melange of ripe tropical fruit.
Thank god for the Vermont style IPA. Bold, bright, in your face fresh with tropical fruit and a bitterness that cleans and balances instead of defines and lingers. I can't ask for anything more. 1,193 charactersludachris, Mar 20, 2017

I was introduced to it this past Christmas by my brother-in-law in central VT, and while Heady Topper still reigns supreme in terms of name recognition, this beer is truly a near perfect distillation of water-malt-hopps-yeast and care.

This beer is as good as advertised. I don't have the palette like some of the other reviewers but this beer is delicious. 
The only small negative is the alcohol bite you get at the end but that's what you get for an 8%. I read somewhere below that this great beer maybe better served at the 6.5% and I actually agree with that. 517 charactersPSanger, Mar 14, 2017

I don't know what kind of hops were used, but I really don't care much for the hop profile. By no means is it a bad beer, but at $4+ a can, I don't think it's worth the cost of entry. Pours with a decent head, aroma of dank hops. Taste follows suit, dank hops, a lot of mango. Since I'm not a big fan of mangoes, this is a negative attribute for me. Glad I tried it but I absolutely do not get the hype and wouldn't buy it again at this price. If I should be expecting my beer to taste like tropical fruits, should I be expecting tropical fruits to taste like my beer? 669 charactersLarryV, Mar 10, 2017

Nice, slightly hazy orange, with dense white foam.
I could smell this from 15 feet away, holy cow, what an aroma. Juicy and tropical, massive amounts of mango and pineapple on the nose.
Taste is just ridiculous. Tropical, juicy, hoppy, floral and balanced. This has it all. Absolutely superb.
Soft, medium body, with a hint of numbing booze.
The hype is most definetely deserved. This is one of the best IPAs I've ever had, and I will drink this every time I get the chance. 509 charactersJamFuel, Mar 07, 2017

Look- Pours a transparent radiant brass color leaving a thick finger of creamy white foam that slowly settles revealing moderate lacing. 
Smell- Grapefruit, pine, mild passion fruit and spicy floral esters. A hint of butyl and cheesy yeast is  hiding in the back. 
Taste- Dank and weedy with grapefruit, passion fruit, pine, fresh rubber and spicy floral notes. 
Feel- Resiny thick but very crisp and clean with a bitter dry finish. 
Overall- Giant fruity/floral hop smell and taste in a great looking, easy drinking 8% beer. And it's not hazy! This is some seriously great nectar that is appropriately named. A must try for IPA lovers. 769 charactersPrager62, Mar 05, 2017

L -- Slightly hazy pale orange with a three finger solid white head that dissipates fairly quickly, leaving minimal lacing. Looks less beautiful when held up to direct light, but such is the case with many cloudy brews. 
S -- Incredibly complex hop character: aromas of pineapple, peach, mango, apricot, pine, honey, maple, lilac, orange, and grapefruit, to name a few. The only aspect that prevents a 5/5 rating is a very mild sulfuric smell, that is almost masked by the pineapple. 
T -- Largely follows the nose. Very well-honed focus on the fruitiness that hops can impart, without *any* of the bitterness that often turns me off to particularly potent IPAs (i.e. Sculpin). 
F -- Starts mild, building to an explosion of hop flavors, which then taper off to a nice faint sweetness. 
O -- Wow, is all I can say
93/100
EDIT (4/30/17): I've recently had the newest iteration of SoS, which contains the 2016 crop of hops. They wrote a post about this on their website, and I agree with their feeling that the aroma is less tropical fruit filled and the flavor is a little less 'juicy' than before. I'm not going to change my scoring numbers since I still really like this brew. It's pretty clear that the current dip in quality is temporary and not due to factors in Lawson's control (i.e. overproduction) 1,327 charactersHolderness, Mar 02, 2017

I have been drinking so many hazy beers lately that when this first poured I wondered if I forgot to roll the can. Don't get me wrong, it isn't crystal clear...but much less haze than a lot of IPA's coming out right now. Lots of citrus, maybe caramel/vanilla, but also that hop forward bitterness that hooked me on IPA's all those years ago. World class! 381 charactersphilday, Feb 28, 2017

Some very light malty sweetness is there but leaves the hops at the forefront. A really good balance between the more extreme haze juice bombs and the west coast style. 378 charactersNarkee, Feb 22, 2017

She is a thing of beauty. Pours a glowing, cloudy honey gold. 1 finger of white foam. 
Nose is delightful. I have a 2/7 can that I will plan to compare this to SOON, but getting strong floral / citrus notes from the opening pour. My nose is hovering over the top of the glass, and my wife is asking what I am "sniffing in the kitchen"... 
Taste mirrors the nose. Juicy and slick. it is awesome. Which mean it was probably more awesome a couple of weeks ago. Which means I will need to be more aggressive in terms of getting to that 2/7 can. 
Feel is crazy light for 8%. It isn't too bitter, it isn't too sweet, it isn't to thin. I keep finishing my pulls off with a look of nodding approval towards the glass. 
Overall, it is the best month old beer I have ever consumed. Really (REALLY) looking forward to getting to the fresher ones in the fridge! 897 charactersnuggetlover, Feb 21, 2017

Finally available (in very limited quantities) in Massachusetts, I was tickled to get some. 4/16oz/ $15. Not cheap! But one of the finest ales I've tasted. The canned goods I understand are gypsy-brewed at  Two Roads in Connecticut. Says so on the can. HVS like honesty.
The brew is copper colored, a tad cloudy but clear compared to Trillium, Hill Farmstead, Heady, etc.  The aroma hit me as I poured can to glass.  Knew then this was gonna be good. AND IT IS.  Fantastic beer in every way.  The flavor profile is common to what they're now calling New England IPAs. I'd been calling them Vermont-style, but close enough. If you like this style, you'll love SOS. 729 charactershudsonvalleyslim, Feb 17, 2017

Beer canned on date of 1/20/17. Pours a slightly hazy yellow with good carbonation. Some suspended particles are evident when held to the light, but really, who cares. Up until now I've been drinking right from the 16-oz can. Smells of juicy tropical fruit...I suspect mostly Mosaic & Citra hops. Notes of strong pineapple & melon & orange. Tastes similar to the nose with a great light bodied, easy drinkability as the alcohol is well hidden for 8% abv. Just a touch of bitterness which lends this beer to being very approachable. Overall, a very well crafted NEIPA. This is what I would consider a classic example. Don't be a hater of the style until you try this one.  Very excellent and worth seeking out. 802 charactersjwhancher, Feb 05, 2017

Raw hop nose. Citrusy and spicy with a touch of orange zest. 
The malt base is weak given the extraordinarily strong bitter hop. It makes one of the longest aftertastes I've ever experienced. Think of it as similar to sucking a hop pellet. Decent body and carbonation. Hop lovers will rejoice at this extreme version of an IPA. 399 characterssmcolw, Feb 05, 2017

Was lucky enough to get 10 pretty sweet beers sent to me by a college buddy. Decided to start with Lawson’s Lip of Sunshine, which I sampled on July 27, 2016 at the second annual MW bottleshare. Only gave it a 4 at the time but I was the last to have it and only had the ending. Hoping for it to live up to its reputation with a full review here.
Poured a straw-gold yellow semi-hazy color with 3-to-4 fingers of rocky white head. Bubble streams coming up from the bottom of the glass. Outstanding spotty lacing. Excellent retention. (Sight - 4.25)
Smelled a potent mix of tropical and citrus fruit up front, getting juicy red grapefruit, tropical punch, passion fruit, mango, orange, pineapple, floral and some herbal. Definitely Citra in the hops, but not sure what else. Just fantastic on the nose. (Smell - 4.75)
Man, the taste was just as good. Got Citra, red grapefruit, fruit punch, passion fruit, very sugary, mango, blood orange, pineapple, floral and bitter tropical rind. (Taste - 4.50)
Light body. Oily-to-creamy texture. Average carbonation. Abrupt, citrusy, boozy finish. (Feel - 4.00)
This was fantastic. Much better than that warm sample in July. Pretty boozy and sugary though, not sure I’d want a 4-pack (yes I would). (Overall - 4.50)

Nose:  nice.  citrus notes peel maybe a little pith.  mainly grapefruit.  there's a nice malty note. little bready. maybe a little tropical fruit and herbal dankness there as well.  the nose is not HUGE or overwhelming.  
Taste: Wow.  THat's really tasty.  Really well balance. there some nice citrus and tropical fruit notes that go to a citrus ptih bit and then there's a malty piney note that brings it all together.   It's a little hot on the back end which I'm surprised considering my can has a solid 6 weeks on it.  unlike alot of other  NE IPAs I've had you can taste the 8% which is why I'm dinging it down to a 4.25 vs. 4.75
Mouth: medium light.  slight cream. I dig it. 
Over:  First Lawson's and first Sip.  I really like it.  I'll continue to trade for it.  It's not a hazy juicy hop bomb.  But just a really nice well balanced IPA. 1,044 charactersGumbo_gravy, Feb 03, 2017

4.6/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a fiery shade of orange with just enough frosty haze to it to keep anything on the other side of the glass muddled from view. Head forms two fingers in height and stark white in color. Head retention is great, with a strong ring of white foam staying around the top of the beer for a long while. Lacing is scattered about randomly, but modestly. Aroma is dripping full of hops, with notes of citrus, pine, and resin. Additional notes of strawberries, and biscuit malts. Hop notes really open up in the flavor profile, with notes of citrus, orange zest, pine, and a little sticky resin in the back. Biscuit malts support the otherwise hop-strong flavor profile. Despite a large presence of hops, the beer remains grounded and modest, with an approachable aurora. Mouth feel is smooth, with just enough graininess to give this beer a wonderfully filling, and medium-thick consistency. Overall, it's a sublime IPA with plenty of wonderful qualities going for it. The hops are solid in the aroma, but really shine through in the flavor profile. It's hoppy, and yet smooth. Considering it hits at 8%, but drinks like it's 4%, this is an incredible IPA.

4.68/5  rDev +2.6%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Very foamy, thick head with a slight orange/brown tinge. The top looks like cream. Top bubbles are very fine, but lower are bigger; dissipates quickly. Lacing is excellent. 
Pours a translucent golden orange with some very fine particles visible when held up to light. 
Aroma is not that strong, but there is pine and malt and hops present. Definitely an IPA, but a well-rounded aroma. 
The feel is not as full as some of it’s hazy hop bomb DIPA neighbors, but it is very balanced. Begins with a measured burst of piney, almost sweet carbonation. I find the the level of the carbonation itself very nice.
This beer doesn’t try to overdo anything. The hops are present but not overpowering, and there is a malt characteristic at the end, accompanied by lasting bitterness and earthy hop flavor with maltly sweetness. The taste really does last awhile after the swallow. 876 charactersj_d_b, Jan 13, 2017

Good look but not the best, Tree House and Swish come to mind with a better look. Smell is awesome fresh citrus with a little pine. Taste is what you want in this type of beer fresh, smooth and pleasing. No faults can't say too much bite or too fruity just right! Good feel carbonation is there not overpowering. The balance to this beer is what makes it what it is. It is right on every level. Other beers may have a better look and feel but at the end of the day you want the beer to taste good and this beer delivers that. 563 charactersRugg315, Jan 13, 2017

F- Not too heavy, not too light

A: The beer is a deep gold color with a short off-white head that fades slowly and leaves a thick but spotty lace on the glass.
S: The aroma contains grassy hops, fruity citrus and caramelized malts.
T: The taste starts out sweet with flavors of caramel and fruity citrus. Then a strong but not over-powering grassy hops bitterness comes in and strengthens as you continue to drink the beer. The malt character is hearty and brings a very good balance. The after-taste is slightly hoppy and slightly sweet.
M: Crisp and smooth, medium body, medium carbonation, finish is slightly sticky.
O: Tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, good kick, very good representation of style, this is a very good 2IPA to pound down for a long time. 865 charactersTheManiacalOne, Jan 07, 2017

Look: light to medium gold color with a medium to medium minus haze and a finger of bright white head.
Aroma: Definitely citrus forward. Mostly grapefruit. Some mango in there as well. Aroma doesn't burst out of the glass though. 
Flavor: Citrus translates to the palate along with a strong pithy, Campari like bitter finish. 
Mouthfeel: Not thin by any means but thinner than it's ABV would imply. Makes the beer very drinkable.
Overall(style points): One of the original NE style IPAs that revolutionized the world of beer. It's still good enough to hang with many of the juice bombs coming out nowadays but its no longer among the best. 91 Points. 690 charactersMikeyMcD86, Jan 04, 2017

Look is nearly crystal clear.  Smell is lacking - Mostly citrus rind and pine, but nothing distinct vs. similar beers.  Taste is quite sweet with flavors of wood and citrus.  Medium-heavy body with a sticky start followed with a dry finish.

It's balances bright notes with a full body wonderfully. If I could I would drink this beer every day. 359 charactersDanJaffe, Dec 28, 2016

5/5  rDev +9.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I'm going with 5's across the board, so far this is my favorite VT IPA. I think it's the smoothest and still has the 8% kick.  It has almost a sweeter taste instead of the heavy hops taste of most IPA's. I don't believe it's very difficult to get a hold of, I would highly suggest picking up a 4 pack if in the area. 316 charactersLoveBeer1380, Dec 04, 2016

A: Clear amber pour. Tall frothy light tan head. Quite good head retention and mild lacing. 
S: Floral and tropical fruit hop notes. Surprisingly not a huge aroma, it's shockingly subtle I'd say. 
T: The taste, however, is not subtle. Layers of hop flavors. Absolutely bursting with tropical fruits. Pineapple and mango with a citrus kicker. Resinous, dank hops as well - more towards the middle. Floral in the finish and aftertaste, especially lingering between sips when nothing else is left.
M: Medium bodied, smooth and bitter. 
O: Man, talk about a multi-layered IPA. It doesn't punch you in the face right off the bat, but the big bold flavors just keep coming and building off of each other all the way through. Great flavors, great balance, great in general. One of the very best. 815 charactersDope, Nov 14, 2016

Minimal, rapidly receding lacing.  Nose is pine sap (almost Crusher-like), with a faint hint of honey.  Floral notes on the nose are accompanied by lemon and orange peel.  Dank, resinous, with a thick, honey-like character that makes it (once again) reminiscent of The Crusher.  The density of the pine flavor here is what sets this IPA's palate apart - a strong pine note that plays harmoniously with a prominent, dank, lupulin component.  Mouthfeel is medium - thicker than most IPAs, without being smoothie-like.  This is an artful, traditional take on the DIPA style.  World-class. 683 charactersLAp, Oct 30, 2016

S: Aromas of tropical fruit and citrus consisting of orange, pineapple, melons, mango, passionfruit, and grapefruit. Dank and piney hops come through strong as well.
T: Evenly fought battle between the fruity and hoppy characters with strong notes of grapefruit, orange, and tropical fruit accompanied by piney and resiny hop bitterness. 
F: Medium bodied, smooth, and crisp with good carbonation. Slightly dry.
O: Overall, a great DIPA. Awesome balance between the fruitiness and hoppy bitterness. The balance is very elite and makes Sip extremely drinkable. Slight juicy character. Very unique. Would love to try this fresh. Well worth the search to get this. 885 charactersBeerGuy8315, Oct 22, 2016

Palate Contaminants: other beer
Appearance is a pleasant clear gold with a moderate amount of head. The glow is really nice.
The smell starts with marmalade and malt. The malt sweetness is accompanied by some cedar. It might be a little woody, but it's actually savory overall.
The taste has a base of malty candy. The main shades are sweet and savory, and bitter just adds a little color (which is usually where I prefer it). Other than the orange from the marmalade, I also get subdued lemon and papaya. Sweeter fruits like nectarines come and go. The white wood and pine are still there, but not strong.
For something with this much sweetness – though not a sugar bomb – it's not sticky like Boston Lager can be. The carbonation is well integrated, and the savoriness and sweetness that characterize the flavor remain in the aftertaste.
I'm glad I tracked it down, but it's still behind Pliny and Hopslam for me. (Not like there's any detriment in that.) Still, I like to visit Vermont, so maybe... or probably... 1,043 charactersZythophile, Oct 20, 2016

Served chilled into a goblet glass, Sip of Sunshine is a slightly hazy golden yellow orange color. The head is thin and settles quickly but leaves some spotty lace.
Aroma is fresh and citrusy with great orange and grapefruit coming through nicely. Also some floral and tropical fruit notes.
Flavor is sweet up front with honey and orange juice. The hop bitterness comes in from middle to end with grapefruit primarily and pine in the background. The flavors play well together and give good balance between sweetness and bitter citrus.
Mouthfeel is medium bodied and perfectly carbonated. Very drinkable and impressively balanced for a double IPA.
Overall a fantastic example of an east coast DIPA and I'm very happy to see it in Colorado if even just for GABF 2016. 801 charactersGilGarp, Oct 11, 2016

Poured from the can this isn't the best looking brew. Fairly hazy and opaque with plenty of white particles floating around. Aroma is largely pine and citrus driven. Can definitely get a sense of the abv here as it doesn't go unnoticed. That being said it is not overbearing. There is a raw hop character in the aroma as well. Finish is full of pineapple and passion fruit. A really tasty DIPA from VT and a solid brewer. It is worth noting that I scored a couple 4-packs of this and it is incredible how quickly the flavor drops off with age. 568 charactersJimmys, Sep 30, 2016

Smells of caramel, pine, citrus, and Amarillo hops.  Hints of tropical fruits like pineapple.
Amazing.  Full of tropical fruits, none of them distinguishable.  Its like the fruitiness has become as one with the Amarillo, and citrusy hops.  Feels like only a slight bitterness on the end for all the hops, but it has a wonderfully fruity, floral, pine, and citrusy balance.  Hints of black pepper at times.
Amazing balance.  Slightly syrupy body, with a very light, foamy carbonation.
Amazing.  Balance to perfection.  Great day in Vermont.  Had on tap at Prohibition Pig in Waterbury, Vermont  Sept 28th, 2016. 701 characterspatre_tim, Sep 29, 2016

16 oz can, dated 8/22/16, poured into a teku 
A- A slightly hazy golden copper with a three finger white head.

T- Citrus, some tropical fruits, grapefruit and hints mandarin oranges, slightly floral, bitter piney finish, hints of sweet malts, finish lingers.

4.64/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Picked up in VT, was canned almost exactly two weeks prior to purchase given date on bottom, enjoyed same day.
Poured into a glass, fairly translucent golden amber yellow colour. Slightly opaque, holding the glass up to the lamp, can see plenty of fine particulates in suspension; unfiltered, like other fine VT IPAs. Nice white, foamy cap of frothy head. Good lacing.
Aroma is wonderful: citrus, slightly piney/resinous quality, mango, lots of fresh hops. I don't notice as much of the floral scent, but that's just me. Very clean.
Clean, crisp blast of citrusy goodness, some tropical fruit character, perfect level of hopping -- initially fruity, then smoothly bitter, then a bit of maltiness (not cloying at all), then a long pleasant lingering bitterness in the finish. This is one smooth and incredibly well-balanced beer. Seems like a bit more going on than most DIPAs I've had. Just enough carbonation to add a little lift to the moderate body. Even the can looks neat and unique.
SoS and Focal Banger are my two all-time favourite Vermont IPAs. This one is slightly mellower but loaded with flavour and a superbly crafted beer. It really is as wonderful as the reviews suggest, just wish availability was slightly better. 1,234 characterskylesobrien, Sep 18, 2016

F: Very nice and full. medium carbonation. Not soft, but I doubt they are going for soft.

Pours hazy orange gold with a full one-inch off-white head that remains as a cap on top and leaves strands of lace. The smell is of tropical fruit, faint floral accents and a hint of pine. The taste follows with pineapple, mango,  papayan watermelon and some pine bitterness. Full texture with crisp carbonation. A solid offering but, slightly overrated, in my opinion. 390 charactersFurlinator, Sep 11, 2016

For me IPAs are like crack. Once you start you can't stop. I was just about to check out with some 90 Minute when the guy in front of me has this 4 pack of pint yellow cans. I had not seen it on the shelf but I was mesmerized. "What is that?" I asked. He said get some because it's hard to find. I ran back to the case and found it. There was no price so I was a bit concerned but you know how it is to be on a quest for the best IPA. I said f$%^ it and took a chance. I was unaware of the brewer but now I know. It was the cousin of Heady Topper. I am from CT and I have been to Vermont and know how hard Heady is to get. SOS is very good but I think our group gets a bit star struck with the celebrity brewers. Because of my lack of education in the nuances of the flavors of IPAs I am always skeptical of the reviews. Sip Of Sunshine is very good and I am glad I had the opportunity to try it. I may even get it again if I have a chance but at $15 for a 4 pack even when it is this good is a bit excessive. I would love to try it on draft. Maybe its time to get back to Vermont. 1,175 charactersdrsoapy, Sep 04, 2016

4.39/5  rDev -3.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5From a 16oz can, dated 07/12/16. Served in an imperial pint/nonic. How have I never rated this before now? But I haven't.
Pours a mildly hazy, orange-gold with two fingers of lush, creamy, off-white foam. Ecru? Ecru foam. The head fades out quickly but leaves behind sheets of sticky lace.
The nose is sharp and crackery, with spruce, melon and sexy sweat.
Taste is sweet-malt-forward immediately subsumed by a creamy rush of tropical fruits, jungle flowers, cantaloupe and pine sap. Finishes caramel, dank, with sticky bitterness.
Feel is medium-to-thick bodied, lightly carbonated and smooth drinking. The mouth-coating creaminess results in the otherwise light bitterness building up on the palate over the course of drinking it. In a satisfying way.
Overall, a justifiably highly-rated classic which hardly needs yet another review. It seems to me that, each time I've had it, I've gotten something different from the nose and taste, but that it's always well balanced and the look and feel are always consistent. If I reviewed it again next week I'd probably come up with something substantially different - but it would still be really, really good. 1,160 characterspapposilenus, Aug 07, 2016

4.78/5  rDev +4.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75A little backstory: I recently reconnected online with an old friend who lives just outside of Burlington, VT.  Naturally I begged him to send me some Heady Topper. "No," he replied. "If you want some you'll need to come for a visit," adding, "Heady's great, but there are even better beers up here." So I broke down and flew up there this past weekend. He greeted me with Sip Of Sunshine, which I'd never heard of. Absolutely fabulous! Following it up with my first Heady was almost anticlimactic. The latter was undoubtedly delicious, but I preferred the Sip.
Footnote: Two days later I tasted them blind, loved both, but ultimately gave a slight nod to the Heady. Regardless, Sip is totally deserving of its lofty ratings. 726 characterstopofthehops, Jul 21, 2016

4.27/5  rDev -6.4%look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Don't normally do the full-blown ASTM-style beer reviews because I find them a bit pedantic, but I'm prepared to do a special review for a special beer. I'll go full-blown beer reviewer for my first of the major New England IPAs (and I got some Alchemist goodies on the way to review too!). Here we go.
Look - Gorgeous and sunny - reminds of Oberon without the cloudiness from the wheat. Attractive, heavily carbonated, which leads to a bit of a nervousness on my end because of my experience with heavily carbonated IPAs and stouts, but an undeniably sexy brew.
Smell - Nose is multilayered in that I've taken in its aroma three different times and each time pull out something different. Pine, grapefruit, juicy hops, and tropical undertones populate it. I like it quite a bit.
Taste - One of the easiest IPA tastes I've come across in my life. Not a palette-wrecker when it comes to the hop character, but silky, almost buttery smooth, as it makes its pine-forward hop character known. Finishes with a decadent and subtle grace, almost a wink, as it exits your mouth.
Mouthfeel - How I like my hops in that they are pleasant and refreshing, not annihilating and overbearing. Not as soft as the beer itself but damn soft.
Overall/Verdict - One of the best beers I've ever come across and the best IPA I've yet to have (we'll see what the latter end of the month has in store for me with more desired IPA reviews). Can't get over how silky smooth and purely refreshing this beer is. Trying to conserve and sip, but end up taking in more than I want each time. It's that good. 1,581 charactersSteveJeremy, Jul 17, 2016
3.42/5  rDev -25%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 2.5 | feel: 3 |  overall: 3.25I've never understood this beer. I describe Sip as being like coffee: it smells sooooo good. And then when you taste it . . . well it's OK but it never lives up to the smell. Obviously, many coffee lovers will disagree with me on that statement. But the point is that I'm always disappointed by this brew. I've left it for months and then come back to it, made sure the cans were fresh etc. But always I end up not even wanting to finish a single can. 
To me it's the least interesting of all of these top New England IPAs. It's got a sort of musty, corn/rice-grain-like undertone that I tire of instantly. Sure I get the pine and the resin (although I don't catch the citrus bomb in this one) that everyone talks about. When a friend of mine first tried it at my house a year ago, after having no exposure to these NE IPAs previously he smelled it and said, this beer smells like a Christmas tree. Maybe. But the finish isn't there for me. 
There are a few beers on BA that score 100 and surprise me (Sculpin anyone?). Treehouse's Julius is a 100. I get that. It's not my favorite beer  (I like some of their other offerings better) but I get it. It's totally unique. There's really nothing like it. Sip to me just doesn't compare. I think maybe if one was used to drinking standard lagers, it might be a nice, careful introduction to the world of over-hopped New England IPAs. But in the mean time, for me, it might be better described as just an over-hyped New England IPA. 
Sorry Sip. I've tried and tried. And while you are certainly better than the masses, I'm just not connecting. 1,590 charactersdms, Jul 17, 2016
4.84/5  rDev +6.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75One of my all time favorite brews. Although I still prefer the bottled version brewed in Vermont, the canned version brewed at Two Roads in Connecticut is still a world class brew. 
Appearance is yellowish orange, almost tangerine color with a slight haze.  It's not quite as hazy as many of the other New England IPA's and IIPA's. Aroma is citrus fruit juice with huge amounts of dankness. Taste follows the nose with huge juicy citrus notes. The dankness comes through in the flavor as well. Mouthfeel is perfectly medium with good carbonation which creates a perfect finish. This beer is so dangerously drinkable. Once you start drinking, you will be amazed at how quickly 16oz disappears. At 8% ABV, you don't taste the alcohol. Any more than 2 of these can get you into trouble.
Sean Lawson creates some of the best IPA's in Vermont. All of his beers are consistently top notch. I look forward to the Vermont Brewer's Festival every summer just to sample some of his new beers, which can be tough to obtain even living in Vermont. If you ever visit Vermont, do yourself a favor and track down his beers. 1,110 charactersdaudelin2000, Jul 16, 2016

I was on line at a Market in VT waiting for the Heady Topper truck The proprietor of the market addressed the people waiting  and announced that he had Sip Of Sunshine available, a knowledgeable gentleman who had traveled 75 miles from New Hampshire told me it was an excellent brew and he highly recommended it. After scoring both Heady and Sip I drove to the nearest waterfalls to enjoy my score. I enjoyed my first Sip of Sunshine directly from the can after drinking a Heady Topper. The Sip of Sunshine had a pleasant hop fragrance, The taste starts out hoppy but quickly morphs to a refreshing citrus grapefruit bitterness which slowly dissipates. The balanced carbonation results in a satisfying and  mouth feel. 799 charactersbpasseser, Jul 13, 2016

4.35/5  rDev -4.6%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Remarkably clear for a NE IPA, with a slightly darker honey color as well. Pure white, frothy, creamy head.
Smells like a Lagunitas offering - sweet and tropical, almost cloying, with some pine around the edges.
Big lime, mango and candied orange up front. Melon/watermelon and honey mid palate and more traditional IPA piney bitterness on the rear. Bitter orange hop candy lingers forever on the finish. Really clean flavor profile - nothing muddy about this one. Although towards the end of the pint it begins to resemble a Lagunitas Sucks or Waldo more and more (not necessarily a bad thing).
Incidentally, I tried this next to Heady Topper, and SOS was decidedly more sweet and tropical. Heady had a softer palate of peach, apple and grape (think champagne) and was more muddled than SOS. About equally bitter. 817 charactersMongrel, Jun 25, 2016

Tries to be balanced between hoppy and citrus, but the flavors don't blend.  Love the orange/honey color, which is obviously the inspiration for the name.

Had this after a Pliny and a Lights On - this was comparatively a little more tropical, and I thought the finishing/aromatic hops on this were more than Pliny and less than Lights, relatively speaking.  Was a deep orange in color with nice thick, smooth mouthfeel and subtle warming during drinking.  Very likeable - my 8oz taste lasted about 4 mins before I destroyed it. 414 charactersmradamhimself, Jun 20, 2016

4.46/5  rDev -2.2%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Canned 7/21. Consumed 8/6.
A: Pours a slightly hazy golden amber with a soft and inviting white head. Bits of lacing stick to the edge of the glass.
S: Grapefruit- and citrus-forward with supporting roles played by fresh, dank, musty herbs and caramel malt sweetness.
T: Sweet and malty start is quickly overtaken by an array of candied tropical fruits. Red grapefruit, pineapple, and mango flavors abound, ultimately giving way to an assertive piney bitterness on the finish.
M: Silky, creamy feel that makes this dangerously drinkable. Barely a hint of alcohol, aside from the malt sweetness I get up front on the flavor.
O: Despite its origins in the land of the Alchemist's Heady Topper and Hill Farmstead's Susan, Sip stands in a category outside of the hazy, juicy, hop-forward (D)IPAs that Vermont is known for. It doesn't seem to attempt to hide it's rich malt character, instead choosing to use it in conjunction with an explosion of sweet, fruity hop flavors. And just when you think you're drinking pureed caramel fruits, a resinous punch of pine brings along a substantial bitterness that combines with the sweet aftertaste to produce a decently dry finish. Overall, it's a very unique beer that truly succeeds in what it's going for. 1,251 charactersavas, Jun 19, 2016

Appearance: It poured a slightly hazy golden orange colour with a big three finger frothy white head that had good retention and left nice lacing.
Aroma: Lots of fruit with orange, orange rind, grapefruit pith, lemon and pineapple. There’s also some honey and a hint of dank mustiness.
Taste: Citrusy lemon, lime, orange zest, tangerine and grapefruit bitterness plus tropical mango and peach. Nice light candied toffee and caramel sweetness in the background.
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation.
Overall: Ahh, what a stunning DIPA. I prefer Sip of Sunshine over Heady Topper, but in the end both are really good. Great balance between bitter and sweet and easily ends up as a must buy beer for me. 798 characterskitch, Jun 10, 2016

A - Bright orange with a hint of copper, two finger frothy pure white head and some legs/lacing
S - Huge hops, musty funk, dry and sweet grains/malts, English ale yeast, orange,  tropical, grapefruit, citrus rind, sugar, green/brown earth, dank and your lawn the day after it was mowed.
T - Smooth hops up front, very sweet malt/grain with some slightly toastiness mixed in there, peach, mango, pineapple, pine, orange, island flowers, grapefruit, very floral, fresh water, dry yeast, 
M - Full bodied, well balanced, great complexity, medium acidity, medium carbonation with a huge hoppy/malty extravaganza on your taste buds, 
D/O - One of the best IPAs I have ever had. Out of the can or in a glass just a model of perfection. The best quality this beer has is not doing to much but what it does is beautiful. The hops are bright, the malt/grain sexy, Stands with Heady, Elder, Hopslam and the like. Amazing!
Final thoughts - no idea on the price as it was a gift and a perfect 8% ABV. I would recommend drinking thsi one and not hanging on to it. If you find it on tap, drain the keg! 1,159 characterswhatthehull, Jun 05, 2016

Poured with a creamy, dense, sticky, bright white foam with good retention. A plethora of tropical hop aromas: grapefruit, orange rind, over-ripe pineapple and mango with light spicy notes at the end. Malt aromas were light. Medium bodied with medium light carbonation and an incredible smooth creamy feel. Pleasant warming sensation through the middle to the end without the boozy burn. Medium high, juicy hop flavors of pineapple, mango, and grapefruit followed by medium hop bitterness and spicy hop notes near the end with pleasant boozy warmth. Finished semi-dryly with pleasant hop flavors and a medium light bitterness that did not linger. Dangerously drinkable for a DIPA. Incredibly smooth and bursting with flavor. 790 charactersIronLover, May 19, 2016

S:  Bam!  Awesome nose on this one. Loads of tropical fruit, some citrus, sweet malts, super hoppy and juicy.  I couuld smell this all day.
T:  What else.  Huge amounts of tropical juicy fruit just jump out.  Mango, pineapple, guava, grapefruit, lemon mix with the sweet caramel malt to hold the beer together.  Towards the back end I get the alcohol, but not overwhemlingly so, mixed with some pine notes that is bitter but not overly so.  Finish is dry with a lingering bitterness that lasts forever.  Wow, what a great beer!
M:  Full, coating, prickly, dry and some alcohol.  Nice carbonation and easy to drink despite the abv.
O:  This is a fantastic beer!  First time trying it and well deserving of the hype.  Just a masterpiece DIPA that falls squarely in the ABV that I like my DIPAs.  Great, great beer.  I hope we see more of this and more Lawsons stuff.  Well done. 1,041 charactersKadonny, May 12, 2016

4.91/5  rDev +7.7%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Time for a proper review.  
Look: A nice, light see through amber color with a little bit of head and a bit of lacing. Looks like a filtered IPA should. 
Smell: Oh my, a ton of hops hits your nose. Grapefruit, orange, lemon, passion fruit, and a bit of guava. Smells like sunshine. 
Taste: tastes like liquid hops. Super dank and super fruity. There's a bit of pine in the mix for good measure but the citrusy notes are predominant. 
Feel: Feels absolutely perfect for the style; super smooth and light; I could pound a few of these and not realize it. 
Overall: This is probably one of my favorite beers that I have ever had and having it on draft didn't change my opinion of it; it's still my favorite. If I could buy this all the time, I probably wouldn't buy any other IPA. It's that good. 798 charactersTHSmusicman, May 11, 2016

The nose was lacking. I want a double to let me know there's hops in there and these were very muted.
Taste was similar, I just kept wanting more of everything.
Overall not impressed but will try and get my hands on a few more to update this review. 412 charactersd3brewing, May 10, 2016

My only issue with this beer is that I wasn't able to drink more of it. Will put this on my list of beers that are worth traveling for. 338 charactersUnfiltered413, May 08, 2016
4.4/5  rDev -3.5%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Poured 16oz can into snifter. Canned on 3/5/16 so just over 2 months old.  Golden orange and very hazy with a big 3 finger white head. Great retention and loads of foamy lacing cling to the glass. The hops are dominant at first crack of the can. Piney, bitter citrus, a some tropical notes showcase this beer. The nose is quite pungent. Waves and waves of hops hit my palate. Pine hops, bitter citrus hops, and even slight notes of tropical hops. A subtle sweetness peeks in every now and then, but the hops push it back. Full bodied and sticky with awesome carbonation. Goes down easy even at 8% ABV. I really enjoyed this and believe the can helped preserve the hoppiness. 674 charactersRi0, May 08, 2016

4.5/5  rDev -1.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.25 |  overall: 4.5Poured at 49°F from a 1 pint can (canned on 21Mar16) into a Spiegelau IPA glass. Consumed on 03May16.
LOOK: Pours with 4 fingers worth of dense, off-white foam. At 1 minute, the foam becomes rocky and porous. After 3 minutes, the head has finally receded into a fingers worth, leaving behind a subtle amount of very thick foam. Honey orange in color with a moderate amount of cloudiness. There is a large quantity of both small and medium-sized rising bubbles. Lacing is moderate in quantity and very thick.
SMELL: Very strong aromas of mangoes, papayas, peaches, and apricots entangle with mild white bread and floral hop aromas. Hints of alcohol nicely combine with the other aromas.
TASTE: Strong flavors of mangoes, peaches, papayas, and apricots burst onto to the palate. Mild white bread flavors trail immediately and bring some malty balance. Mild floral hop flavors present themselves next as fruit flavors grow slightly stronger. To my disliking, yet not surprising, subtle bitter hop flavors and hints of alcohol enter lastly as all previous flavors persist.
FEEL: The beer is medium-bodied with subtle amounts of carbonation. It goes down smooth and slightly creamy while also clinging to the back of the throat like syrup. Finishes with a strong and unpleasant dryness.
NOTE: As the beer warms, the bitterness becomes more prevalent. 1,346 charactersMyotus, May 04, 2016

4.24/5  rDev -7%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.2516oz. can served in a tulip nonic.  Pours a burnt orange hue with a hazy clarity and a creamy, half inch, bright white head.  Head eventually disperses into a band around the shoulders leaving a soapy slick across the surface.  Some swaths and slashes of lacing are present during the tasting.  Nose expresses citrus, melon, rind, guava and a light earthy/herbal quality.  Taste consistent with nose; however, earthy/herbal character hits more upfront in the flavor profile.  Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a carbonation just shy of crisp that leaves a residual prickle at the back of the throat between quaffs.  There's also just a kiss of acidity.  Its n'o the first time I've had SoS (surprised I hadn't rated it) - that said, it's a very good DIPA and a great example of what's coming out of VT (even though this one is brewed in CT). 846 charactersJwale73, May 01, 2016

3.94/5  rDev -13.6%look: 3 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured into a tulip glass a couple weeks after purchase. Overall the hype around this beer is legit; however, not sure if the difficulty in obtaining the beer is worth the effort. The trick of late addition hops creates a lot of bright flavor without the rosiny bitterness. However, some back end bitterness is apparent in this beer, unlike some other beers in this category (New England DIPA)
L: cloudy. Not sure why this is all the rage. I'm scared I'm going to fart a lot in the next several hours. Head is cream colored and fluffy, though dissipates fast.
S: Hawaiian tropical fruit nectar, with some pine resin (like how your hands smell after hanging lights on a fresh Christmas tree). In writing it sounds odd, but it works.
T: Tons of tropical fruit but without the sweetness of punch or nectar. There's enough piney resin and bitterness to balance it all out. This is a sub-category of an American DIPA, which has become a really wide category. It's not overly dry, not bitter, and if that's what you're looking forward to you won't like this beer.
F: Thick, ready, it's not heavily carbonated so there's no sting from the foam. But it works. More carbonation would have been a distraction.
O: A quality beer. I won't go really out of my way to get some; however, if available, I'd buy it again. 1,305 charactersGeeL, Apr 24, 2016

L - Pours a slightly hazy amber color, with the center leaning towards copper. Doesn't glow quite as much as the name would suggest, but I can't really complain. Tops off with two fingers of cream colored head with moderately fine bubbles, and settles to leave a decent amount of streaking.
S - Predominantly piney on the nose at first, with blooms of pineapple, clementine, and a hint of grapefruit as you smell for longer, rounding out with nicely with the sweetness of tree sap. There is a slight but consistent amount of dankness in the background that maintains a slight earthy aroma. Noticeably less juicy smelling than some of its contemporary DIPAs, but still very sweet and pleasant.
T - The bright and herbal character comes across strongly at first, accentuated by a splash of hop resin, but not too much so. Mid-sip is where the flavors open up the most. A ton of tropical fruit flavors swirl around as expected, but some surprising tastes - peach and apricot primarily - are also present. The flavor is incredibly juicy and sweet, much more so than the smell would suggest. The finish is equally smooth - the bitterness from the hop resins is almost nonexistent, and the aftertaste is primarily orange and grapefruit.
F - Mouthfeel is perfectly smooth and full; very drinkable, but without feeling too thin. The relatively fine carbonation adds just the right about of sparkle at the first sip to nicely complement the pine flavors as they bloom into the overall fruity character of the taste.
O - Fantastic double IPA. I think the way Sip of Sunshine manages to incorporate the hop resin into its flavor profile (that is, to complement the first notes of pine and herbs on the tongue) as opposed to fighting the bitterness is one of its defining characteristics as a remarkable beer. Not the most fragrant beer I've had, but definitely one of the best tasting. 1,925 charactershowielchen8, Apr 14, 2016

A fluffy bleached white head foams up  2 cm even with a gentle pour.  The head slowly recedes to a sturdy surface layer that leaves some clingy lattice on the glass after each sip.
Aroma is piney hops, some citrus with lemon and peach and mango.  Quite a complex nose and definitely hop forward.
The first sip reveals a fairly smooth body and fine yet very tingly carbonation. Texture is smooth and the beer is easy to drink. Flavor is a bit of caramel but moves to all hops very quickly after the first swallow moves across my palate.
Grapefruit rind and mango hit my lips and then some pine notes and a very dry astringent aspirin bite on the finish.
No hints of the ABV as I work through the can and I finish it rather quickly after opening and pouring into my glass.
This is an enjoyable beer, and very complex hop character.  While I liked it a lot it may be a victim of the hype train as it didnt completely blow me away. 1,032 characterssulldaddy, Apr 09, 2016

Smells of tropical fruits, citrus fruits, pine and hops.  Taste follows the nose.  Absolutely amazing flavors--mango, pineapple, grapefruit, lemon and hops.  Starts out a little sweet and finishes slightly bitter.  Very complex and well balanced, moderate carbonation and a smooth mouthfeel.  Incredible beer, I wish it were easier to find, but well worth the hunt. 468 charactersEMH73, Apr 06, 2016

Either way this one is still a fantastic beer. Beautiful amber color, nice perky head. Aroma is very piney and soapy, very much a prototypical west coast IIPA. Smooth flavor brings out the true nature of the hops here. Finishes clean and dry. 330 charactersNachojon, Apr 06, 2016

Looks like a clear copper to light orange brew with a thick head a nice lacing.
Smells citrusy and dank, hops and a wonderful nose,
Tastes amazing.  So much fruits (mango, pineapple, lemon) and hops.  A complex brew.  Really love the taste.  Tastes almost just like heady but with a touch more character.  Not bitter for a DIPA.  Well balanced.
Miuth feel is medium bodied and smooth.  Great after taste.  You know you drank a well crafted beer.
Overall I love this beer.  Better than heady for me, and we'll worth the hunt.  It took me a while to finally get this beer and I'm glad I finally did.  I wish I could drink this more often. 683 charactersJay_P22, Apr 03, 2016

There is nice deep orange / amber transparent look with foamy lacing. Reminds me of Abrasive that is first sweet and then bitter with different waves of intensity. Very strong beer, but I do believe that is a tad overhyped. 317 charactersTrevor11, Apr 02, 2016

Poured a a slightly hazy yellow gold color with a white head
Smelled freaking amazing! Citrus all around with some tropical fruit and a little bit of pine and hops
Tastes of tropical fruit, citrus, mango, grapefruit and melon
Perfect amount of carbonation, juicy IPA with almost a sweet aftertaste. Bitterness is great with a medium body
A very well balanced IPA!

Smell is very nice with strong tropical notes, mango, papaya, pineapple, lemon zest and orange peel. Taste matches the nose, very tropical. Not much of a malt backbone in my opinion. Strong mango, melon, puckering zest and very slight dank. Nothing overpowering just a perfect balance. A very sweet tropical IPA.
Fantastic IPA. Have yet to try any other NE hops besides Heady, but this gives it a run for its money. 491 charactersMateo2699, Mar 19, 2016

S: Dear Lord. Bursting with more citrus than I can explain. A nice hint of pine and a little sweet malt.
T: Very bright up front; more resin than on the nose with tons of grapefruit, a hint of apricot and a subtle bit of pureed peach. After an intense beginning it smooths out perfectly into a long resinous finish. A slight breath of ethanol on the way out.
M: After the nice carbonation at the beginning it gets silky smooth. You expect more tongue scrape but there is almost none to finish even with all the piney flavors.
O: This is the second time I've had SoS and it's just as great as I remember. I can't think of a DIPA that is as perfectly balanced and flavorful as this. Amazing. Thanks so much, Joe! 767 charactersRockjocknroll, Mar 12, 2016

Tried it on tap at Pro Pig in Waterbury. Great a amber color with an amazing citrusy aroma.  The taste was sweeter than I expected but still fairly balanced, went down awfully smooth, with no evidence of its alcohol content.  Both HT and SoS are world class, so it really came down to personal preference for me. Overall it's a great beer but there's other top notch DIPAs out there that are easier to get your hands on. I wish this was one of them. 564 charactersBeerasaurus, Mar 07, 2016

A — Pours a vibrant orangey hue into the glass, clear initially, but a bit of sediment towards the end of the pour creates a nice slightly hazy orange body of beer in the glass. A smooth off-white colored head forms on top and leaves behind some nice consistent rings of lacing.
S — Smell is nice and citrusy, bit of lemon, hit of orange peel and pith, some light tropical hints of pineapple and mango, little bit of pine on the finish, overall balanced and intriguing.
T — Layers of flavors ranging from bitter citrus to semi-sweet tropical fruits. A lemony start leads way to some pineapple, melon, mango as well, a little bit earthy, resinous, and piney on the finish. A nice hoppy display and showcase in balance.
M — Medium bodied, just the right amount of carbonation, a smooth and lingering bitter finish.
O — Very nice overall, a well done Imperial IPA. Not the best in the world, but still a nice example of the style. 976 charactersMoose90, Mar 06, 2016

Not a hop bomb, but just about perfectly balance DIPA. Citrus abounds which does away with the bitterness that you would typically find in the finish of a DIPA. The 8% abv is completely unnoticed. I'm so psyched to finally tried this, and was not disappointed. 371 charactersBeglane, Mar 02, 2016

Sorry.  Anyway, picking up light citrus hops in the nose.  Not overpowering.  Taste is not what I expected, but excellent nonetheless.  Citrus hops, a bit of lingering bitterness but with a solid malt backbone to balance it out.  Not the hop bomb I expected but balanced DIPAs can be just as enjoyable.  Drinks more like an IPA than a DIPA.  In a good way! 474 charactersDrStiffington, Feb 28, 2016

Nice amber color. lots of carbonation. long lasting head with sticky lacing
Aroma hits you right from the get go.  Dank. Cat pee (in a good way). 
Feels like I'm drinking straight hop juice. Delicious. Dry, mildly bitter finish.
The feel is really where this beer shines...sticky, coats your whole mouth with wonderful hops.
Was glad to finally get a chance to try this one...thanks again jeffgott for the can!

4.43/5  rDev -2.9%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Finally got around to having one of these after trading for it at the Other Half line in Brooklyn. Heard many good things about this beer and for the most part, they were true. Juicy, bright, and easy to down, the alcohol was so well-hidden that it didn't even feel like there was much in here! 
Great pour to this as the beer had golden apricot hue, massive head, loads of clingy lacing left behind, and a opaque shine that begged to be admired. Lots of tropical fruit and candied sugar in the nose with even more in the taste. Mango, papaya, stone fruit, crystalline sweetness, and a bit of honey were found in the taste as the beer had the mouthfeel of the finest of nectars. Sticky, sweet, and juicy, there was so much going on here that it was hard to find the hops. They were here waaaaayyy in the back as they felt like melon and honeydew rind, coming across quite dry in the midst of a beer that was medium in body and carbonated. The herbal and dank aftertaste only added to the depth of this as the complexity of this beer became more and more apparent as it warmed up.
There was a warming from the booze but never could I taste or feel it, which allowed everything else to shine through much more radiantly. This is one of those beers that's not necessarily at the top of the lists but is near the top on everyone's list and for good reason - it's the standard by which many American Double/Imperial IPA's are measured against and a true sip of sunshine because of the brightness of the flavors here. Wonderful stuff that everyone on here should enjoy at least once! 1,579 charactersJerzDevl2000, Feb 14, 2016

I've had this beer before and seem to remember it being better. still a nice beer overall. 529 characterszshaft, Feb 13, 2016

With a soft, kind of mushy head,this beer is perfect to split with fireflies on a summer evening. With aromas of tangerine, lemon, and mangrove, this beer smells like the Florida everglades. The subtle taste of cherry licorice reminds one of childhood candy store runs, and the more noticeable taste of feta cheese stuffed olives is perfect to relax one after a long day. 457 charactersbeerliver3, Feb 09, 2016

Hint of orange rind, sweet tart, and fresh dewy, only slightly dank hops.
Zippy, tangy, a little bitter, but very nice. Total glass of summer--which to me is a shame, simply because it really peeves me how many good IPAs come out mid-Winter.
This is my first time with this legendary beer. Granted, this isn't mind blowing, but it doesn't have to be. In fact, I never realized until now, this beer is the template that so many of my favorite younger breweries are looking at in trying to develop flavor profiles for their bigger crowd pleasers. 617 charactersSabtos, Feb 09, 2016

This has always been my favorite beer, even better than the various Tree House beers, Heady, Pliny. But the past two releases of SOS have been off. None of the awesome aroma that punches you right in the face, not the great heavy juicy body, and it's missing that great bitter finish. I figured that the first batch was just a one time miss but now it's been two in a row. Wonder what they're doing over at Two Roads?? Hope they get back on track! 490 charactersgileadhopfreak, Feb 08, 2016

4.28/5  rDev -6.1%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25L- As Vermont DIPAs go this beer is quite clear. A cautious pour still led to a towering 3 finger bone white head. The lacing is modest, but lasting.  Color is a beautiful light gold.
S- The nose of this beer is incredibly floral in nature. It makes it stand out from the citrus crowd.
T- There is some citrus in the taste, but again I find the beer to be more floral than citrusy.  
M- Mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium. Good carbonation gives it lighter mouthfeel and the beer finishes fairly dry because of this.
O-While I prefer a more citrus forward DIPA, this stands out a bit for its floral forward nose and taste. I enjoyed it and understand where all the love comes from. 689 charactersNotAlcoholicJustAHobby, Jan 30, 2016

Appearance: beautiful orange-golden and wonderfully bright. The head is off-white with excellent 1/4" head retention. 
Aroma: the beer smells great yet is way "underpowered." Rather than an olfactory assault, a moderate nasal inhale in required to get the hops. Some tropical fruit and pine, but, again, light. I pick up a very mild amonia scent. 
Flavor: light sweet malt background, which provides a great canvas for the hops. The hops comes through as light citrus and a small bit of pine. Not as tropical and juicy as I expected. 
Mouthfeel: heavy-medium. At 8% abv this is closer to a light double IPA than a strong IPA. 
Overall: certainly worthwhile, but I don't think it's of the caliber consistent with its hype. I received this beer in trade for La Cumbre Elevated IPA. Drinking the two side by side, I prefer the La Cumbre. This beer is very good, just not as good as many of the equally scored BA rated beers like Bourbon County, Parabola etc. 980 charactersPray_For_Mojo, Jan 23, 2016

Look: hazy light orange with a head that's impressive in both its size and persistence.
Smell: tangelo candy, very slight hint of grassiness. Generally kind of mild.
Taste: like tropical fruit gummy worms. Super clean, lots of fruit, pretty mild in terms of bitterness and sweetness (but a pretty good balance between the two).
Feel: like melted tropical fruit gummy worms. Seriously, this is one of the chewiest IPAs I've had. Highly drinkable.
Overall: it's somewhere between good and very good... but, I don't know if it's even better than Enjoy By Unfiltered, which (as a Californian) is way easier to get. 673 charactersneurobot01, Jan 17, 2016

While it was a typical juicy IPA, I didn't notice any standout characteristics that would set it apart from, say, Victory's DirtWolf, which I think is actually quite better. The aroma was sort of nonexistent and it just didn't blow me away as I'd hoped. 509 charactersBiggtriksta, Jan 11, 2016

Look and Feel of the beer is pretty standard. Nice light golden color and well balanced mouthfeel, not overly carbonated nor too light.
The smell and taste pair hand in hand, with CITRUS standing out the most for this beer. However, the citrus does not overpower the malts and drinks like a true ale. Though SoS doesn't explode with flavor (in my opinion), it is extremely well balanced with flavors making it super enjoyable 467 charactersbol3by, Jan 08, 2016

Aroma is unsurprisingly hoppy with some juicy grapefruit and mango but also a bit of resiny pine and some bready malt. Taste follows the nose; the focus is on juicy tropical fruits but a bit of bready malt is also present. Medium-light body with a bit of slickness from the hops. I can see why this is so highly sought after, lots of hoppy goodness, and immensely drinkable. 529 charactersmnj21655, Jan 07, 2016

Bright, crisp and ornate.  Loads of ruby red grapefruit on the palate with gooseberry, pine and lemongrass.  If I find an IPA better than this, it will likely be in heaven.  It really is a Sip of Sunshine. 487 charactersLumens66, Jan 04, 2016

L:  Pours a semi-transparent deep golden color.  Nice creamy white head and delicate lacing.
S:  Tropical fruits, biscuits, and faint evergreen.
T/F:  A strong malt backbone sets the tone for a delicious and juicy tropical hop experience.   Passionfruit and pineapple... grapefruit tones... and just a hint of flowers and evergreens.  Beautiful mix of hops, well balanced, and excellent mouthfeel.
O:  One of the best IPA's I've had and about as close to perfect as you can get.  If you can find it, GRAB IT! 550 charactersEMV, Jan 02, 2016

Served in a 14 ounce curved goblet at 39F.
Right off the batt, the texture, appearance and lacing on this ale are by far the best i have ever seen. This beer just looks so amazing in the glass. From the bronzish,  slightly translucent, plasma like color coding, to the millimeter of carbonation head. Lawsons mastered this. This ale looks so damn good in the glass. Better than Heady Topper in terms of lacing, texture and color, imo..
Aroma is stone fruits, winter melon, smooth vegetal. The nose is fairly descriptive of the flavor profile. 
Smooth and balanced. This IPA creates the aforementioned attributes to perfection. 
Possibly some steel cut oats for the amazing mouthfeel.. It's perfect either way. 
An absolute amazing 4 pack. 
If you are in NY, CT or RI and have access to this, it's an instabuy. Hopefully my fellow beer advocates don't hoard it for trading, and every average IPA drinker can catch a taste of the real deal. 1,070 characterspinyin, Dec 28, 2015

From a can into a snifter
APPEARANCE: Pours a 2_ finger, medium looking, frothy white head with great retention. Clear gamboge  orange with no carbonation evident. Head slowly fades to a slight wisp and leaves some foamy lacing on the top of the glass. A slight wisp and ring remain until the end but leave no real lacing. 
SMELL: Lots of mango, pineapple, lemon notes, some grapefruit and light caramel on the nose. Aromatic for sure. Nice tropical fruit and citrus qualities. Huge and excellent. 
TASTE: Floral and tropical up front with mango, pineapple, then some floral hops at the swallow. Big finish is bitter with floral hops, grapefruit, lots of pineapple and mango with nice tropical fruit lingering on the palate. Really good stuff. 
PALATE: Medium body and medium levels of carbonation. Only semi-creamy on the palate, goes down fine and finishes a bit dry. Some well balanced bitterness lingers. 
OVERALL: This is great stuff and well worth the praise it gets around here. Not overpoweringly bitter but well balanced with heaps of tropical fruit character all over the place. The feel could be creamier for the style, but that's a minor complaint. This one is just as good as the label says, actually, so believe it when you read it. Thanks again Joe! Always good times. 1,340 charactersJeffo, Dec 27, 2015

4.7/5  rDev +3.1%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Pours a very hazy golden, glowing orange color with two fingers of an off-white head.
Aroma is outstanding. Like smelling a bag of gummy bears. The sugary, honey-like sweetness combined with the fruity, dank hops are an amazing combination that many breweries try, but few succeed on perfecting. This is quite near perfect. Get tangerine, blood orange, grapefruit, mango, pineapple, passionfruit, and peach from the hops. All of these fruits are candy-like from the sugary sweetness provided from the malt. There is a cannabis-like dankness lingering in the background too.
Taste follows the aroma nicely, which I was hoping for. Extremely drippy juicy. Get peach, tangerine, grapefruit, and mango juiciness up front. Middle brings more of the same, with the addition of more tropical fruit (pineapple, and passionfruit). Finish somewhat dries out the sugary sweetness, but still leaves a lingering undertone of juicy peach and mango. A nice bitterness of grapefruit and orange peel also appear on the finish.
Medium body. Smooth and velvety creamy. Somewhat oily on the finish, but still quite clean all things considered.
This is one of the better IPA's I've had in a while. The extreme juiciness on this beer is unbelievable. Like many other east coast IPA's, it is complex and hoppy, yet somehow stays balanced. Insane stuff. 1,333 charactersbrewskis, Dec 24, 2015

This is a boozy hop bomb that might be the true definition of a double IPA. Like the warming sunshine on a crisp autumn day. Full of hop oils and piney, tropical fruit. Beautiful color and aroma.
Update on 02/24/17: Happened upon a 4-pack of cans at my local store. Quite the surprise but makes sense because it recently began distribution in Mass. Dated 02/07/17, so just over two weeks old.
Pours like syrup, slightly hazy, with a minimal head. Nose is all resin, pine, and herbs. Fruitier in the flavor with a dry, resinous finish but also thick and sweet. Flavor and sticky feel linger for a while. Quite good and gets better as it warms. Worth the hype? Sure. But I'm glad I never went out of my way for this. 762 charactersGatch, Dec 17, 2015

It poured with a finger and a half high bright white head that died down, leaving a short head covering the surface and lots of lacing down the sides of the glass.
S: Moderate to high aromas of citrusy hops are present in the nose—oranges and lemons seem to stand out in particular—along with hints of tropical fruits.
T: The taste follows the smell, but has even stronger flavors of orange and lemon hops.  There is a light to moderate amount of bitterness. Some tropical fruits become noticeable as the beer warms up.
M: It feels medium-bodied and somewhat crisp on the palate with a moderate amount of carbonation.
O: This IPA is bursting with aromas and flavors of citrusy hops—these really shine through because the malts aren't very noticeable.  It's also not very bitter considering the amount of hops that were used.

Had on-tap@ Prohibition Pig in Waterbury, VT
Appearance - Served in a 7oz glass, the brew is crystal clear and purely golden in color with a white, half finger head. Good retention, then breaks down to reveal a thin, consistent layer of surface suds. The lacing mostly consists of broken lines and spots here and there.
Smell - Strong, citrusy aroma. Orange and grapefruit with a hint of lemon.
Taste - Follows the nose. Packed with a ton of citrus character. Juicy orange with light grapefruit bitterness. Mango undertone. Malts mostly keep hidden, but do enough to provide a generic, bready sweetness. Mid-taste brings mild lemon and a faint leafy mint character that helps to give the finish a bright, clean and lightly bitter send-off. 
Mouthfeel - Medium-bodied with moderate carbonation. Slick texture lendsGoes down quite easily. 
Overall - A strong IPA with bright, citrusy character and little bitterness, this is certainly worthy of praise. I wish I could have snagged a few cans to get more comfortable with the subtle nuances of this brew, but alas I will have to settle for knowing I was lucky enough to have tried it on tap.
05/16/16 Update: Got two cans in a trade. Just as good as I remember! 1,253 charactersTheSixthRing, Dec 07, 2015

4.81/5  rDev +5.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Pours a beautiful golden color with a pretty foam head and plenty of lace. Amazing and juicy tropical fruit blend and dank resiny hop oils. Such and interesting and complex taste that manifests itself in three stages. First, it is citrusy and sweet on the tongue. In the middle phase the palate becomes much drier as does the finish. This is the phase where the hops take over as well as a some bread malts coating the big hoppy taste. By the third stage, the tropical fruit juices re-emerge and form a balance with the hops. An unbelievable and unearthly creamy and smooth mouthfeel. Medium bodied and on the dangerously drinkable side.
Absolutely freaking delicious! A true Wow beer! 685 charactersGajo74, Dec 05, 2015

Pours slightly hazed light golden.. nice foamy white head with good retention.. Lawson's always does hops very well.. Pithy and tropical fruity hops show nicely in the aroma, very dry with almost no background maltiness.. Flavor is nice .. good hoppy flavor but the overall package just isn't there as far as world class IPAs go.. Dry and pleasant, but no real complexity... Almost sessionable..

A- Opens well and pours a 1" high white head that lasts for around a minute or two before film out. Medium gold colour and somewhat filtered. Looks like some sediment suspended in it but I don't call that negative. 
S- Oodles of hops here. Must be a bunch of different varieties. This brew has the best of my 3 favorites IPA's all in one.
T- O boy this is good. Gotta be one of my favorites and hate it because I can't get it easily. Vermont is a LONG way away. This is complex to say the least. There are so many flavors going on I can't believe it. It's like a Headstock that is bang on but a touch better and that is saying a lot. Not too sweet, not too bitter. This is IPA perfection. Juicy, fruity and grapefruit.
M- Creamy, dry, tart, and it keeps going. Just complex on almost every level.
O- WOW this is good. I can't say enough good things about it. Hard to find something bad to say. If I had to pick at something it would be leave more goodies in it and don't filter it!
Food Pairing
This wonderful brew went perfect with....... Cesar salad! Believe it or not the cheese and anchovies just highlight this brew then the bacon breaks things up to hit the crisp nature of the salad with olive oil. Just wonderful. I like grilled chicken in mine to get it to a meal.
Enjoy! 1,365 charactersDaveBar, Dec 04, 2015

Canned 10/19. 
A clear light copper with a frothy white head that falls off slowly leaving choppy peaks, this looks great. The nose is awesome. Very West Coast, this is dominated by hops, with pine, grapefruit and tropical fruit. Mild resin is present. Semi ripe peaches and mangoes are noticeable, forming a nose balanced by bitterness and fruitiness. The palate opens bitter, mildly pungent and resiny with a clean, pine like bitterness with citrus oils sweetened with fruit juice. Quite brilliant, really. After all the messy IPAs, this is refreshing. Malt character is mild with a touch of burnt sugar and a little cotton candy. Drying, clean, resiny and bitter, this pungent DIPA makes me happy. Alcohol character is quite well hidden too. 783 charactersDefenCorps, Nov 28, 2015

Doesn’t show for much up front but then hits with endless waves of lemon. Definitely the grapefruit end (rather than tropical fruit) of Citra, but nuanced in a way that would reward repeated visits. Super bright, but in spite of complexity, would it get a bit samey? 4 575 charactersStJamesGate, Nov 27, 2015

However, I went the opposite direction and enjoyed this on a chilly fall evening while grilling out steaks for the last time this year. Best IPA I've had from the northeast to date; so smooth! Will definitely seek out more through trading and future Vermont vacations. Midwest comparison - fresh Two Hearted on tap. Similar floral/tropical aroma and flavor. 414 charactersSwettenham_Shire, Nov 21, 2015

4.61/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5After 3 unsuccessful trips to the beer cave at my liquor store i thought this brew was impossible to obtain. I always assume local vermont brews are in short supply, but this one in particular was a bitch to find. After I finally did get my hands on it I chilled it in the fridge for a solid hour, counting down the minutes till Lawsons. The opening was crisp and the aroma immediately struck me as a fresh hoppy smell. I mean this beer was made not one week beforehand, the aroma filled the room. I took my first sip out of the can and the taste seemed to change 3 or 4 times while just in my mouth. A light citrus turned into a hoppy crispness then to a true double ipa; airy but lets-you-know-its-8% finish. 
I poured the rest into a glass and the hazy elixir foamed up about 2 inches. A moderate amount for an IPA. The carbonation is heavy but for a warm weather beer it is perfect!  The smell is unmistakable, a nice piney hops. Very similar to the grapefruity pine smell of dear heady topper. What a time to be alive for Vermont beer!! 
Not a beer to be overlooked, Lawson's has a distinct crispness that will be remembered for many moons. Very similar to cone head as well, perhaps the full bodied taste makes sip of sunshine a little more revered in the Vermont area but to each their own. This will be a tough one to match in the beach beer department 1,362 charactersKNISH11, Nov 17, 2015

Smell - Hops, citrus, pineapple, pine.  Seems to get stronger and smell better as I continue drinking.
Taste - Piney, with a mild amount of citrus and a great hop bite.  The hops are the last flavor that hit my palate, but they don't linger.  I was amazed at how quickly the aftertaste dies.  Very well balanced beer.
Feel - Perfectly carbonated, very smooth, leaves you wanting more.
Overall - Outstanding IPA up there with the best of them. 537 charactersPourharddrinkslow, Nov 16, 2015

Lawson crafts interesting (and sometimes challenging!) beers but S.O.S. is super smooth and and easy-drinking while at the same time completely loaded up with hops.  The nose on this beer is amazing.  The interesting thing about S.O.S. is that it doesn't linger.  You get a great nose, its enjoyable on the palate and after you swallow you're left wanting for more.  No extensive lingering bitter notes. 439 charactersNEBeerTraveler, Nov 16, 2015

A: Golden yellow color with mild hop haze. Bright white foam with long lasting retention. Fine titley nit bubbles.
S: Moderate to high hop aroma with an emphasis on tropical and stone fruit (Mango, peach and pineapple,), Light malt aroma, slightly bready. Neutral clean fermentation character. light evergreen aroma comes through as it warms up. No alcohol detected.
T: Moderately firm bitterness with strong hop flavor - Mango and pineapple in the beginning that leads to an overripe papaya flavor. The malt is low with a slight bready flavor that supports the hops nicely. Balance is on the hops. A slight pine and overripe pineapple finish that comes of very dry. 
M: Moderate carbonation with a mild to medium body and a dry finish. The hop oils cover the tongue and provide a creamy pillowy mouthfeel. Slight alcohol warming, but appropriate for style.
O: Great beer, it reminds me of a bigger version of Zombie Dust with a dryer finish. The only thing that would improve this beer would be a little mellower alcohol presence. 1,058 charactersguityler83, Nov 03, 2015

A: Golden-Amber colored with some haze to it. Fine-bubbled white head retains at a full inch in height and leaves chunky rings and patches on the glass.
S: Mango, tangerine, pineapple. Fruit cup. Spicy hops, leafy, soft pine. Whiffs of caramel and light toast. Vibrant and tropical.
T: Mango, cantaloupe, tangerine, pineapple. Earthy, spicy,  tobacco, good dose of pine. Bitterness is stiff and even throughout. Sturdy malt base brings some caramel and honey flavors. Light prick of alcohol. Trailing earthy/pine hop finish.
M: Hefty medium-thick body. Round and sturdy malt texture with a creamy and chewy feel. Slightly coating too. Astringency is gripping. Light alcohol warmth. 
O: Great balance for the style. Intense earthy and tropical hop flavors play off of a more traditional and hefty malt base. It's a classic double IPA for the new age. Perhaps a little more grounded than some of the other highly touted Vermont DIPAs, though every bit as good. 993 charactersryan1788a5, Nov 03, 2015

The aroma hits you as soon as you crack the can.  Lots of sweet orange, tropical fruit, and caramel/honey malts.    Ripe grapefruit, resinous pine, mango puree, pineapple juice, guava, oniony dankness, honey, peach, and some melon.  Flavor has good bitterness, balanced with honey sweetness and tropical fruit notes.  Bitter grapefruit, candied orange, guava juice, spicy pine, apricot, peach puree, biscuit malts, honey, and pineapple.  Very smooth and crisp.  Dry, clean aftertaste of pleasant tropical citrus. 623 charactersCzarkazm, Oct 31, 2015

4.63/5  rDev +1.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This beer deserves all its accolades.  It has a gorgeous golden color and delicious aroma to get the taste buds prepped.  Majorly hopped character right up front, but dry and carbonated enough to taste strong but still be refreshing.  Grapefruit bitterness is the main player here, with touches of pine and orange.For a beer this flavorful in a 16 oz can, they go down so smooth that I have to count the empty cans to realize just how much I've drunk today.  Similar but slightly more flavored and fuller that it's north VT brethren Heady Topper, I consider this among the best beers in New England. 599 charactersAmity83, Oct 31, 2015

A- Pours a medium amber color with a 3/4 inch off-white head that retains like a champ before slowly lowering to a thick ring around the edge of the glass and a mostly full sheet of surface foam.  Semi-resilient lacing leaves large clots behind.
S- Bright citrusy hop aroma  brings to mind pineapple, apricot and mango.  A bit musty and dank with a slight cat pee essence.  Tiny alcohol presence.
T- Lots of stone fruit flavor including the aforementioned mango and apricot.  The bitterness level is spot-on as well as the alcohol presence making it incredibly drinkable for the ABV.  
M- Perfect amount of sharpness from the hops with medium carbonation and a body leaning toward the lighter side.
O- Definitely gives Heady a run for its money.  While not as piney or earthy as Heady, it's a fantastic DIPA that rides an excellent balance between bitter and fruity. 954 charactersImmortale25, Oct 19, 2015

A - pale amber nearly clear body with dense foamy white head. Great retention and lacing all the way down. 
S -  lots of bright citrus hops
T -  super dry citrus and floral hops with subtle earthy malts
F -  medium body with moderate high fine carbonation. Very resinous and slick. 
O -  a fantastic ipa. Wish I could get my hands on this more often. It's totally worth the high rating it has. 531 charactersJAFoley, Oct 17, 2015

Then there's the TASTE. This blew me away -- it's so unbelievably balanced. Not too sweet, not too dry earth, just unbelievable. Can't wait to have another.

Aroma is complex with a lot going on: citrus, peach, grapefruit, pine, orange, etc., and it all works together very well.  Taste is initially fruity with peach and grapefruit and then slowly drifts into some bitterness at the end.  The bitterness then fades into a very clean, dry finish.  Carbonation is light to medium and the alcohol is well hidden and barely noticeable.
Suggested food pairing: Grilled shrimp
If you like this beer then you should also try: Abner
Ideal time to drink this beer: Sitting in a lounge chair or maybe laying in a hammock somewhere on a dock in the Caribbean.  The sky - and your schedule - are completely clear.  The beer is so delicious that you almost think it'd be worth it to take off and head back to Vermont to get some more of it.  Almost.
Overall: 4.5 (This beer is very good and I would definitely drink it again) In addition to having the Crash Kings song "Mountain Man" on loop in my head ("I'm sipping on some sunshine!")I had high expectations for SoS and it lived up to the hype.  Great balance of fruity and bitter.  I was only able to secure one can which is a shame because it occurred to me while drinking it that I could really go for about a gallon of it.  Super smooth, super drinkable.  If you're an IPA fan, this is one to seek out. 1,360 charactersSHDoyle, Oct 10, 2015

I had high hopes for this beer, and it didn't disappoint. I knew it would taste amazing, but what surprised me the most was how smooth and well-balanced this one is. They've honestly got a perfectly balanced beer here with perfect drinkability. 461 charactersdo_ob, Oct 04, 2015

4.12/5  rDev -9.6%look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Thanks to angrybabboon for the can.
Appearance: Mostly clear with a slight haze. Dark orange-gold. Head is white, creamy, and fluffy. Drops to a small dense cap with solid retention. Big notches of lacing persist throughout. Moderate carbonation on the pour.
Smell: Hits tropical right up front. Notes of peach and nectarine. Malts are slightly bready with a touch of caramelized sweetness. Slightly roasted. A touch of cracker and biscuit dough as well. Slightly floral and herbal with some solid backing pine branch and a touch of resin. Grapefruit. Light and fruity. Slight hint of alcohol ghosting in the back. Juicy with some minor hints of melon and passionfruit as well.
Taste: Slightly bitter pine layered over a solid tropical push. A good amount of peach and mango with some nectarine rolled in the back. Slightly herbal with a big floral push through the back. Malts are lightly sweet with some solid pale malt. A touch of cracker and toasted white bread. Ever so slightly dank. Herbal. Weed. Some candied hop sweetness. Lingering pithy bitterness sits over the top of the juicy fruit base. A touch of alcohol. Some minor passionfruit and melon as well.
Mouthfeel: Medium leaning ever so slightly to light body with a moderate carbonation. A touch crisp.
Overall: It's solid and incredibly drinkable, but the bitterness rides just a bit high and interferes with the overall enjoyment. Still damn good and worth trying again and again. 1,450 charactersGoblinmunkey7, Sep 20, 2015

A: huge heady soap bubbly body is a gold color with good clarity leaning toward a little dark on the body
S: lots of herbal hops with traces of pineapple a little rust some oat flaked malts
T: very nice herbal hops with a light citrus, more pineapple taste like mosaic hops crackery bready malts 
M: medium body but not very cloying feels light on the tongue and inviting you to have another drink. 
O: This is a solid beer, I don't see where it distinguishes itself from Enjoy By, or some more readily available beers. It is very good but there are a lot of beers that have a similar hop and malt profile that are easier to get. I think the hype has surpassed this beer. 715 charactersSomethingClever, Sep 20, 2015

5/5  rDev +9.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Canned 8/21. I poured into oversized wine goblet like I do for review purposes for imperial IPAs, although sometimes, I do drink them in the can. Maybe with my last one, I'll drink It canned and see if my review is different. A – cloudy, orange and gold colors, strong and slightly lasting head and carbonation. Looks exactly like I want this style to. S – hops, citrus, dank, all strong, balanced well. T – follows up exactly where expected off the nose. It's piney as well, which helps with these. F – a wonderful blend of crisp and smooth, with just the right amount of bitter aftertaste. It took me three cans of this to determine I would pick it over Heady or Pliny. Of course, then a friend reminded me that this is a different beer that those. I swear, this drinks more like an ideal Imperial IPA than the other two… Oh well. Simply an outstanding beer no matter how you describe it. 900 charactersmschrei, Sep 18, 2015

Tropical fruit hits the palate upfront and moves to dank bitter hop finish.  There's a pleasing soft mouth feel.  This is a sipping beer.  The complexity of the flavors lends itself to slow sipping.  I can't wait to try more of Lawson's offerings.  This is a masterfully crafted IPA. 434 charactersChinaskiWMA, Sep 18, 2015

I think hype gives people high expectations and they follow through with their ratings for that "me too" warm fuzzy feeling. I do like this beer though...just not that much. 322 charactersnebula1999, Sep 18, 2015

Feel is great and has that oily resin finish that some many NE beers seem to have.  Very smooth and satisfying. 330 charactersRoland7792, Sep 17, 2015

Huge nose of tropical fruits... pineapple, papaya, tangerine, citrus zest, some earthy pine and a definite caramel malt. smells great from the can as well, light grassyness and a chemical dankness that I really really enjoy.  taste is similar, big hop presence up front, candied fruits and nice sweet malts are definitely working well together. Finishes with a nice amount of bitterness and a wonderful creamy feel. very refreshing, goes down very easy. one of the best doubles out there, highly recommend this beer! 563 charactersHyptochrons, Sep 14, 2015

T: Sweet. Follows the smell, which is pleasant, but I appreciate a better balanced IPA. Perhaps some hops that don't give off such dramatic citrus or tropical notes would help.

T: Tons of tropical fruit, mainly mango, apricot juice, orange and some caramel malt. Finishes with a nice touch of pine resin. A really great beer. Next time, I'll have to try it a bit more fresh. 497 charactersnotchucknorris, Sep 11, 2015

4.8/5  rDev +5.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75This is the kind of IPA that ruins other IPAs. When people describe beer using terms like 'juicy' or 'tropical', the referenced beers are accurately described but also subtle. SOS hits you in the face with flavors of citrus, pineapple, apricot, mango and an amalgamation of insane tropical fruits. Take small sips and the bitterness will linger as a pleasant afterthought, while the that 'juiciness' comes in headfirst along with a balancing yeast in the aftertaste. The result is a sweet, juicy, not overly bitter, and very balanced Double (yes) IPA. My palate is officially spoiled forever. If you see it hoard it. 616 charactersdohm179, Sep 10, 2015

4.58/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Straight pour from a 16oz can to a stemmed, tulipped, oversized wineglass. This was purchased a little under two weeks ago, and according to the date printed on the underside of the can it was canned on August 24, 2015 (“08/24/15  10:55”), which would make this cab just over two weeks old. It’s been kept in good conditions. 
Appearance (4.25): This can pours with a generous head of custard-colored foam . . . capping a nearly clear, glowing orange body that looks like heaven. The head, which is a solid two to three mixed up fingers of whipped foam and broad, lacy bubbles, dies down slowly, eventually leaving a half-inch thick collar of foam around the edge of the glass, connected to a combination of thick, sticky lacing and fat patches of clumpy foam scattered around the glass. Hits all style notes pretty much on-point. 
Smell (4.25): Sweet citrus notes (passionfruit juice and pineapple nectar) mingle with resinous, dank, sticky green along the floral/fruity spectrum—none of the oniony/garlicky stuff—and some fusel that manages to work to the beer’s advantage. A little hibiscus and fresh-cut grass also show up in the nose. Smells like an outstanding (D)IPA, but no new tricks or frontiers are on display here. 
Taste (4.75): Holy balls, you guys. This beer’s driven at first by a mixture of sweet citrus and lightly tart, alcoholic flavors like a mimosa splashed with a gimlet, followed quickly by a moderately aggressive set of bitter flavors including fresh-cut grass (I always think of chewing on Timothy, like I did when I was a kid), dank cannabis, and especially toward the finish, lime peels and white grapefruit flesh. The two other notable components to this beer—malt and booze—work in the beer’s favor but on opposite ends of the spectrum. Bits of sugar cookie, brioche with honey, and dry, floury biscuits fill out a nice body for the hops to drape themselves over, while the boozy, gaseous heat helps to expand the dank- and citrus zest-focused aspects of the hop component. 
Mouthfeel (5.0): Like other top-notch DIPAs on the lower end of the spectrum in terms of body and booze, this beer is somewhat full-bodied but way too easy to drink, thanks to its extremely dry finish. The carbonation seems modest at first, but tingles and expands more than expected, the result being that it only bolsters the drying effect that the hops and booze have, working in tandem. An oily, slightly syrupy character in the body—along with the alcohol heat, which isn’t huge but is still noticeable—is just about the only thing slowing you down and reminding you how big this beer is. Outstanding. 
Overall (4.5): This beer is bombastic but not out of control, and not perfectly balanced but better off for it. Its combination of hoppy bitterness, sweet and dank characters, and surprisingly boozy body make for a beer that’s best enjoyed in sips and moderate quaffs—otherwise it’s easy to miss some of its uniqueness. If you take it in quickly, it tastes like a very good but not groundbreaking (though still entirely enjoyable and even refreshing) small DIPA, but if you take it in a little more slowly you can appreciate how weird and funky its different pieces are when held up against one another. It’s doing the same thing a lot of other beers like it are doing, but in a quietly different manner. Highly recommended to both the newcomer and the veteran of hoppy, pale beers. 3,435 charactersfmccormi, Sep 09, 2015

The nose assaults with simple-syrup sweetened candied citrus, and big, juicy mango and apricot notes. A little pine, and little dankness show themselves as well to complete a massive, beautifully complex hop bouquet. 
The taste follows. It hits with some piney bitterness up front followed by wave after juicy wave of tropical fruit, tangerines, and apricots. A delicate light sweetness supports, yet stays out of the way. A medium mouthfeel and perfect carbonation keep you floating along until boom: that Vermont ale yeast stands up and hits you like the gentle, sweet lover it is. 
Harmony. Balance. Complexity. Intensity. 
What an incredible beer. 820 charactersajchocholousek, Sep 08, 2015

Be sure to follow the instructions on the bottle and keep refrigerated. 405 charactersAbecharron, Sep 07, 2015

4.21/5  rDev -7.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25I bought a 4-pack of this about 10 days ago up in Winooski VT  (for about $14.00 or so). Getting into a 16oz can right now out in The 'Zebo.
Pours a slightly cloudy, medium golden color. Carbo is very minimal and hard to find. The head is a short layer of creamy white bubbles. Doesn't leave a whole lot of lacing, either. Aroma smells like a small bowl of sweet apricot jam with some rindy bitterness thrown in.  It feels pretty smooth on the tongue, and the body is your standard medium.
Flavor has a hint of toasty malt before turning hoppy. There's more apricot-like sweetness and some tangerine. Then things turn more bitter, with some pithy action along with resiny grapefruit. Finishes a bit more on the bitter side than the sweet one. Tasty? Yes, indeed. World-class, sell your firstborn for? Hardly. This is the second can of this I have had since buying it. Wasn't blown away with the first, and now it's confirmed. Another product of the THM™.  Prosit!

I usually love the unfiltered opaque hazy Tree House IPA look, but this look has more of a Pliny look to it. Hops are well balanced in with the citrus and malts and this is a very smooth drinkable beer. Not sure how the ABV is 8% and their Double Sunshine DIPA is 8%, this is categorized as an IPA and drinks like an IPA but has the ABV of a double but I'm not complaining. 5 star. 414 characterscaptainsdaughter, Sep 01, 2015

A - Pours a mostly-clear, bright yellow. Thin/medium white head. Looks the part.

T - Delicious and follows the nose. Juicy, fruity and citrus up front, piney bitterness on the finish. 
M - Medium body, smooth. Velvety. Good carbonation.
O - Phenomenal IPA. Borderline double IPA, but doesn't drink like it. Hops are bright and juicy, everything you want from an east-cost IPA (New England IPA?). 485 charactersmrandypandy, Aug 30, 2015

3.9/5  rDev -14.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.75This beer is overrated and overhyped!  I wouldn't put it on my top 10 IPAs.  In a blind taste test I believe many off the shelf IPAs would beat it purely on taste.  The look and smell are first rate.  It smells like mangos and citrus.  The taste just doesn't do much and actually gets tiring to drink.  I find the hops to be uninspired and not the best in terms of integration with the malt.   I thought maybe it was my palette so two days later I had another's SOS.  No better.  No excuses for this IPA.  It was fresh, had plenty of head and smelled good.  However, It's drinkability is just average. 601 charactersELS, Aug 28, 2015

Small white head, but great carbonation and excellent lacing. Smell is a hop fruit bomb... aroma is an explosion mango, grapefruit, pineapple, orange and some floral hops as well. The taste is exactly the same on the front end, but mid sip a heavy dose of pine and bitterness appears and then quite a dry finish. Feel is light and very carbonated, the 8% is extremely well hidden. Overall this is up there with the best IPAs I've ever had. Never had a beer that starts off so juicy amd fruity, but transitions to a bitter finish so perfectly. Absolutely outstanding! 661 charactersCNoj012, Aug 26, 2015

I poured this lovely beverage into my pint glass out of a bomber I received in a trade. It pours a vibrant hazy orange color that says drink me after an all day hike. The aroma packs in a perfect mix of hops and tropical fruits that matches the taste perfectly. Upon the first sip your palette is hit with all these flavors but not overpowered. The light, crisp and clean flavor has the right amount of carbonation making for an awesome mouth feel. My overall thoughts on this long winded review are try this beer. This is the perfect beer for a hike, picnic or the beach. 680 charactersMikeCooke, Aug 26, 2015

A: Pours surprisingly clear, medium gold to tangerine in color - pours with a large, white head, fades to a wispy cap, a small collar, and leaves sheets of lacing
S: So hoppy, so juicy, so bright - orange and tangerine juice, with some ruby red grapefruit flesh - floral citrus in abundance - big push of tropical aromas, with juicy pineapple, mango, and maybe some melon - straight up leafy hops, with some resin - an understated herbal element that helps round out the aroma, with some light spice, light mint, and some dank notes - pale malts and pale grains hidden beneath
T: Dangerous - very hoppy, but not in an aggressive, palate-destroying way - fresh-squeezed orange juice, tangerine juice, grapefruit flesh - herbal and leafy hops, with some pine and a light touch of mint - resinous and lightly dank - moderate bitterness - pineapple and mango, with an assortment of tropical flavors - light sweetness with some nice pale malts - extremely, extremely drinkable - hides the 8% ABV well, but I have to admit that there is a touch of alcohol in the finish
M: Medium body, nicely carbonated, smooth, finishes mostly dry, some lingering hop oils
O: False. Liquefied sunshine would melt through my face, thus rendering the act of sipping impossible.
After having this on tap on more than one occasion, I am very happy that I have the opportunity to sit with a can and give a proper review. This stuff is absolutely magical. It is not the best IPA I have ever had, but it is probably in the top 5. It's juicy, complex, and stupidly drinkable. This is worth waiting in line to acquire (which is a big complement coming from me).
Edit: After a couple weeks, this beer falls off a cliff. I'm not adjusting my score, but I think it is important to remember to drink this immediately. 1,823 charactersangrybabboon, Aug 25, 2015

At first sip, I wasn't wowed, but as it warmed a little, it was a whole different beer.
Big off white head. Golden orange in color. Beautiful appearance. Sticky lace.
Flavors: So tropical. Massive citrus and fruit profile. Mango, papaya, grapefruit, orange peel. No malts showing here. Light bitterness. A bit of hop resiny stickiness in the finish. 
How is this not a dipa? It drinks like an ipa and hides its abv well. Very impressed with this one. It does live up to the hype. Very impressed. 561 charactersmothman, Aug 21, 2015

4.29/5  rDev -5.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25Big thanks to Kevin for this one. A bomber poured into a matching lawsons snifter. The brew appears a hazy golden color with a firm 2 finger white cap that slowly fades painting the walls with soapy suds of lace.
The aroma is juicy hops citrusy with a fresh squeezed orange appeal with a little catty, herbal and sulfuric appeal almost minty at times with a mild cheesiness to the finish.
The taste is herbal, weedy and pulp/pith/zesty with hops. Plenty of layers of hoppiness mostly flavorful without getting that bitter. There is a firm fruitiness to this and mild sweet grain to balance it out.
This is medium bodied and modestly carbonated. Absolutely crushable as far as drinkability goes. Big thank you to Kevin for gifting me with this treat that exceeded expectations. Id love to fill my fridge with this. 816 charactersstakem, Aug 20, 2015

4.96/5  rDev +8.8%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5Poured from a tall boy can into a snifter, the beer is a bright, vibrant, slightly hazed, golden orange coloring with a fluffy, dense, bubbly, clingy, white head. Beautiful. Aromas of orange, grapefruit, candi sugar, a subtle caramel backbone, heavy doses of resinous hops, pine, subtle pepper spice, and a blast of grass. Unbelievably balanced nose. Flavors are juicy and sweet forward, a perfect balance of orange, grapefruit, subtle tropical notes, and a candi sweetness, all balanced by a heavy resinous hops presence, heavy on piney notes, cut grass, and dank vegetal notes. Amazingly balanced palate, with a lingering resinous character into the aftertaste. The hops aftertaste is highlighted by tart grapefruit and orange, and both linger on through the smooth, dry finish. This is a beast of a beer! 807 charactersGarthDanielson, Aug 19, 2015

Pours bright and translucent from the pint can with a moderate head, slight carbonation and tight lacing. No eye-bulging hop blast here but a delectably mild tropical ecstasy of passionfruit and tangerine with a hint of clove, and a finish smoother than shea butter on your....well, I digress. Lawson's is freak fluid - the finest liquids fo' sho'. Make the journey for this epic summer ale. 652 charactersBill69, Aug 19, 2015

Bright and floral with plenty of fresh hop dankness, in addition to being perhaps the most "drinkable" world class IPA alongside Pliny, this is certainly one to seek out. 327 charactersMineo, Aug 18, 2015

The first time I had Sip was on tap and now I wonder if it was old or the lines weren't clean because I've now enjoyed it on tap as well as in cans and my opinion has changed greatly. This beer lives up to the hype.  It is right there with the many outstanding VT brews such as Heady, 2nd Fiddle etc. Not quite the juice bomb of some DIPA's out there - think Treehouse - but just such a smooth, tasty - drinkable beer plus you'd never know it was a 8.0 ABV if you didn't read the can. Superb brew and worth seeking out. 564 charactersnjcraftguy, Aug 18, 2015

L - Amber to orange at the edges. Crystal clear, I mean I can read through the glass!
S - Pineapple, orange, pine. 
T - Huge fruit flavors, pineapple, lemon, orange apple and the pine is really taking a back seat.
F - Crisp Without a carbonation bit, the apple flavors really make this a smooth sipping beer. Glossy is the best term I can use.
O - O should be for outstanding because this beer is completely opposite to Heady Topper in terms of taste and looks, but it is just as perfect. Another class DIPA from Vermont. 589 charactersJaredSammy, Aug 12, 2015

Golden bronze body color, tinged with orange and lemon hues.  Loads of plentiful fine carbonation through the middle.  Frothy rising bleach white head, but also soapy and even bubbled with excellent even pinhead bubbles in the makeup.  Great looking brew.
Excellent aroma.  Mild dank, but a bigger tropical fruity hop note that comes out not so much juicy but almost perfume like.  Fantastic icing sugar like sweetness that just melts and turns to cream and vanilla on the nose, powdery thick and dense, and brings out a pollen floral sweetness even more so.
Palate just sings.  Such a nice controlled icing sugar malt and bittter hop sweetness.  Bright with sweet candy almost Belgian like but far toned down.  Tropical fruit, and floral earthy tones fill the palate.  Mouthfeel is creamy and rich supportive feeling and has an extremely pillow like softness.
Overall.  Just another winner for Vermont IPAs. 960 characterssmakawhat, Aug 08, 2015

Beautiful golden  orange color body with a 2 finger white soap bubble head.Great amount of lacing in the glass!
Tons of citrusy hops coming out of the glass and hitting the nose with delicious goodness!  Lemon, grapefruit and some tropical fruits.
Taste follows suit with the nose, just a great amount of citrus and some pine all across your tongue.
Nice amount of carbonation and lasting hop flavor with a bitterness and citrus tang.
All around great IPA!  Great example of what an IPA should and can be.  If you can get this IPA.... You do it! 629 charactersjhartley, Aug 06, 2015

The mouth feel is smooth. Overall this is another world class NE hoppy beer. 366 charactersMyThoughtsExactly, Aug 05, 2015
4.88/5  rDev +7%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75In Vermont, this is the "insider's" new best IPA, including by some who, in hushed whispers and darting glances, call it better than Heady Topper.  While technically it's not a Double IPA, it's almost as strong as Heady in terms of alcohol, but does much less with it in the flavor.
It pours a mostly clear murky sunset yellow with a soft, foamy head that sticks around for about 1/3 of the glass.  The texture of the beer is soft and fluffy, a courteous and gentle carbonation that massages, rather than attacks, your palate.
Same goes for the flavor.  The nose is subdued citrus and tropical fruits, namely passionfruit and just a bit of pineapple and pear.  The taste is similar, and it's a very little bit sweet, and hardly bitter at all.  This is a strong IPA that isn't too dry, strong, or bitter.  It practically begs to be drank, and it lives up to its name as well as any beer I've ever had - quite a bit like sipping sunshine.  And yes, I would take one of these over a Heady Topper...so there! 1,006 charactersjmasher85, Aug 05, 2015

4.59/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Tall boy can poured into HF wine stem.
canned on 07/10/2015.
Appearance: Golden yellow body with an orange hue.  3 fingers of bone white head that has good head retention and leaves spotty lacing all over the glass. Eventually the beer drops down to a thin cap.
Smell: bright citrus and tropical fruits are the main theme in the aroma department.  More specifically in the citrus profile you have a sweet tangerine and tart grapefruit; mango, papaya, and pineapple compromise the tropical fruit nose.    This smells outstanding and I will admit that I had my nose in the glass the whole time I drank this beer.
Taste: Upfront moderate bitterness level that just fades away pleasantly after each sip without the bitter bite becoming stronger which of course begs the drinker to take another sip immediately after swallowing the last. I prefer the aroma to the taste as the nose is more complex and interesting, but no question this IPA is quite delicious non the less.  Hops are citrusy, tropical and even slightly floral. Lots of sweet orange and tropical fruits provide the bulk of the hoppy profile found in this beer. This beer is massively hoppy, but you are not blasted with crazy bitterness that is found in most IPA's.  The floral flavors come in near the end of each sip and provide a slightly dry taste to the finish; mixed with some orange zest that makes this beer taste crisp and clean with juicy and sweet hop flavors on the front end and in the middle of the beer. Malt profile is bready with a little additional sweetness that balances out all those hops pretty nice. 
Mouthfeel: medium bodied beer with moderate carbonation levels. The carbonation is dialed in pretty well and abv is well hidden when this beer is cold, but as it warms there is an ever so slight sweet and booze presence. It is still pretty easy to crush the sixteen ounces from that tall boy can. 
Overall: Sip of Sunshine is a great IPA. Lawson's make some fantastic hoppy beers. Double Sunshine still rules the roost as the very best hoppy beer that Lawson's brews.  Bonus points for this beer getting packaged in tallboy cans; that is always great to see. I love the fact that I can't stop burping oranges after drinking this beer. MIght even be the best IPA that I have ever drank. 2,275 characters4DAloveofSTOUT, Aug 04, 2015

4.58/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75This one pours a lovely golden yellow with a creamy white head; leaves plenty of attractive lacing on the side of the glass as well. The smell is extremely tropical at first - think shoving your nose into some hybrid of mango and pineapple. There's a little bit of hoppy bitterness mixed with profound dankness in the nose as the beer warms as well. My first taste was slightly less tropical than I was expecting, but is ultimately very consistent with the bright fruity nose. As the beer reaches the back of my throat the tropical fruit flavors segue seamlessly into some a bouquet of hop flavors, before finishing bitter and leaving me wanting another sip almost immediately. 
This one very much lives up to the hype; an astounding IPA. Wish I was able to pick up more than two cans at a time. 796 charactersTomMorris, Jul 30, 2015

I'm very curious now as to what yeast is used. If it is 1056 or 001, something is definitely amiss. This beer would have been far better if it had a cleaner, more neutral fermentation.

Usually I get a can so who knows what it looks like, but who cares.  One time I did have it at a bar on tap and showed it to a few friends, everyone was in agreement and awe of it's greatness, and it has a nice deep golden hue to it.  Then another time my boss bought all the employees a keg of it that we drank while playing wiffleball one sunday this summer and I remember thinking how goddamn awesome it was even on my like 6th pour into a red solo cup.
Someone about 4 reviews before me said it was like Heady, I cannot agree.  Heady tries to punch you in the face with floral hoppyness from beginning to end.  This has a citrusy, fruity quality that gives it a greater complexity in my opinion.  Heady is more like Fuzzy Baby Ducks, this is more like Julius from Treehouse.  All great, but different.  This is my favorite though.
IF YOU SEE IT SOMEWHERE YOU MUST GET IT.  END OF STORY.  I've heard it to many times when people passed because they didn't know what it was.  Don't be that guy or gal. 1,093 charactersEggsBenny, Jul 25, 2015

4.15/5  rDev -9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25appearance- Golden amber and pretty clear.  Pours a two to three inch head.  
aroma- Citrus, pineapple, and floral hops as well as some malty sweetness.
taste- Definitely get the tropical fruits as advertised with pineapple standing out the most along with citrus.  For the malt there's a bit of bread flavor in the middle, but caramel malts mix with resinous hops for a sweet finish that verges on being too sweet.
feel- Medium/full bodied and medium carbonation.  There's a sticky feel to it that's a tad unpleasant, but that's nitpicking.
overall- Great IPA/DIPA, but it just didn't wow me as anticipated.  The hop flavor is very nice with pineapple and citrus and the malt is solid, but too sweet at times. This might be due to the fact that its almost two months old at this point (even though I just bought it at the store), but I don't think that should have affected things too much.  The hop flavors certainly didn't disappoint, but in the end feel was a bit too sticky and the malt a bit too sweet. 1,012 charactersCTbrew32, Jul 24, 2015

T - Juicy oranges, tangerines, mango.  Pithy grapefruit middle of the mouth, but finishes clean and dry.  Almost reminds me of super fresh Sculpin from Ballast Point.  Dank on the back end which I love.

Since my first taste back in '15 this white whale has been on my wish list every Christmas, Birthday & "...no it really was nothing to simply plug your mouse back in to get your computer to work again, but if you insist, I'd love a Lawson's Sip o' the next time you drive through CT"  request list.
But now it's flooded the NYC beerscape, so I sought it out. All I can say is absence does indeed make the heart grow fonder. The cans I rec'd back in March were all on the cusp of the use by but were still very, very good. The draft I had last night was just OK. 
I will reiterate that I'm not the biggest IPA fan in the world...let's just say I'm highly critical of over the top hops, so if you want to go BIG, just keep right on going because you're wasting precious fluids on the likes of me.
I will give this another shot to be sure mis-handling is not the culprit, but to me, this draft version pales in comparison to the cans I've enjoyed. And here I thought I'd found a soulmate in the IPA world. :^(
Mar 2, 2017. From can at home. Just as I remembered.  At risk of offending all the hoppy-go-luck IPA fans, I must say that this is my ideal IPA.  Clean on the palate, bitterness is a characteristic, not the star of the show & a body that conjures images of Scarlett Johansson at her Sci-fi best, (without the CGI overkill). And of course there's the taste.
No matter what anyone says. this stuff tastes great, so great that you no sooner swallow it when your brains saying MORE.
Jul, 19, 2015 At bottle share, Coopers, Chelsea, NYC. I am an un-hoppy guy. That being said, this stuff is spectacular. Among the 8 or so geeks I was sharing with, no one ventured a guess as to what hops or mix made it the taste treat it was. 
Tropical notes all up in your face from the get go.
I'm considering summering in Vermont from here on in. 1,910 charactersseedyone, Jul 19, 2015

4.51/5  rDev -1.1%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Lawson’s Sip of Sunshine IPA is so good that it’s almost bad (explanation to follow). Remember the Tang commercials from the early 2000s with the karate chimps? SoS looks, smells, and tastes just like the juice bags that those ridiculously coordinated chimps used to sell! To be clear, I’m talking about Tropical Tremor (not that Cherry Craze crap). Now use those opposable thumbs to crack open this fruit bomb of an IPA and find out what I mean. Without a doubt, the most striking quality of SoS is its appearance— although I seriously doubt that anybody ever took the time to pour a Tang pouch into a glass, I feel like they would look identical. A vibrant goldenrod (orange/yellow) radiates from the glass as scents of orange, lemon, and pineapple stimulate your nose (and slowly evolve into a lingering tangerine/grapefruit fragrance. And now for the most important part… there is a problem: SoS lulls your taste buds into expecting a Tropical Tremor Tang juice (a vastly underappreciated beverage by the way), and as a result, your mouth is shocked by the bitterness of the IPA style. Once you are able to accept that the amazing smell and appearance of this beverage (and their other brews) will lead to drink a beer and not a juice-like fruit drink, you will come to respect Lawson’s as one of the premier IPA-makers on the East Coast. 1,354 charactersljjpowers, Jul 15, 2015

The aroma was very nice. Tropical fruit hops, as well as grapefruit and floral notes. The taste is excellent. It has a full body, yet almost feels delicate in your mouth. A plethora of hop flavors, with tropical fruit tastes being the most prevalent. An excellent beer. One that lived up to the hype. 418 charactersBoto, Jul 09, 2015

4.63/5  rDev +1.5%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75A - Golden orange, hazy transparency, white head forming tight and white, with extensive lacing.
S - Floral notes, with strong catty element, and also a tropical fruit note, mango, with a minty, almost menthol note as well, all of which is fortunately integrated into the total package, making it much more attractive than it sounds.
T - The fruit is front and center, with big mango and peach notes, citrus in the form of tangerine and grapefruit, a touch of pith, and a close that goes more for citrus essence, grapefruit oil and floral notes in a long bitter fade.
M - Given how punchy the taste is, the mouthfeel is supple.  Decent carbonation comes with a solid drying, but the beer keeps from becoming taxing.
O - Huge beer, with big hop flavors, crafted carefully and with a lot of finesse.  Delivers a fruity, full experience that is bright as the name suggests.  A top tier IPA for sure. 900 charactersTsar_Riga, Jul 08, 2015

Flavor is initially a little weak in floral and fruity hops, but tropical notes of mango and passion fruit redeem the flavor profile. Resiny bitterness is more powerful than I'd prefer. 263 charactersbarczar, Jul 02, 2015

L - dark orange, slight haze, two-finger head of large bubbles fades fast
S - odd tropical, floral, malts definitely come through, slight onion or dank note
T - loads of tropical fruit, some mosaic-like nonsense, medium sweetness, not very bitter at first but it builds sip after sip
F - medium carbonation, medium plus thickness, slightly numbing
O - a classic, would still blend in well with the latest local offerings from the likes of Other Half and Grimm 484 characterscfalls, Jun 30, 2015

A: Hazy orange-amber body under a finger of dense ecru head; good retention and sticky lace. Attractive.
S: Decadent hoppiness, redolent of oranges, mangoes, and strawberries at first; some floral and herbal notes in the background keep it from being too sweet. Excellent.
T: Follows the nose precisely, with a delicious and complex array of hop flavors. Tropical fruit up front, citrus in the middle, and cleanly herbal bitterness on the finish. Long, delicately dank aftertaste. 
M: Soft, smooth, and moderately carbonated. Lovely.
O: Splendid beer; it beat out a can of Heady in the evening's side-by-side comparison, but was a narrow loser to the truly spectacular Trillium Vicinity. All top-tier DIPAs to be sure; not sure why this one is listed as a single IPA when it's the same ABV as Heady, but in any case I find that 8% is the sweet spot for balancing maximal hop flavor with maximal drinkability. 
Cheers! 954 characterswoosterbill, Jun 27, 2015

Hop oils linger on the palate for a while, to my content. This beer raises the bar to another level amongst competitors. Fantastic brew. 255 charactersHopglow, Jun 19, 2015

A:  Pours a clean orange gold with a thick and foamy two finger head, no visible carbonation
S:  Citrus, passion fruit, pineapple, and stone fruit – maybe gooseberries . . . kinda Sav Blanc white winey.
T: The passion fruit and pineapple sweetness come out like cotton candy and it’s pretty awesome; it is a tad busy, but I believe it’s just Citra hops.  It’s got a great sweet orange blossom taste on top of that and it just bursts with fresh fruit sweetness.  Ok Mr. Lawson, you win this one.
M:  It’s a great balance of full body sweetness, carbonation, and hop bite (alcohol too) – just well done.
O:  People love to deflate hyped beers, either because the hype had their expectations set in the heavens or because it makes them feel cool to shoot down/ nonchalantly brush off the coveted, or both.  Either way, it’s not fair; if I had never heard of this beer and picked up a pack, I would be delighted with how good this is.  After hearing that people wait in line or drive for hours to get a pack, my expectation would change or I would cock my head sideways in confusion . . . depends on how far alone in the trying continuum I am in this scenario.  Word play aside, it’s a damn great beer that should be appreciated as the one-man-army-brewing-out-of-a-shed-developing-this-recipe-then-getting-a-large-enough-following-to-score-a-contract-brewing-deal-with-Two-Roads-Brewing-to-mass-produce kinda beer it is, the man who made this beer isn’t too far off home brewer status.  93 1,695 charactersPanda_Brew, Jun 15, 2015

Beer was a bit darker than I expected, smell was absolutely a delightful bouquet of hops. Really fruity and juicy.
Taste followed along suit. Super juicy with a surprisingly lighter-than-anticipated body. I consumed two of them without much effort. I give them props for feel on that one. Just a damn good juicy IPA, what can I say? On the hotter days I would take this one over Heady. 453 charactersBranfordBound, Jun 10, 2015

Just over a month old.
Pours clear honey-gold with tall off-white head. Smell is citrusy, a little tropical pineapple as well.  Taste is more piney up front with plenty of citrus and graininess in the finish. A little spicy and bitterness is fairly strong. 
Overall a very good IPA, but perhaps a bit overrated. The flavor profile didn't seem all that 'juicy'. I would like to try a fresher sample someday and re-review. 460 charactersd5001986, Jun 05, 2015

Smell: Citrus orange and grapefruit.   Less orange and sweet that Tree House Julius.
Taste: Like it smells, very strong hops and citrus from start to middle to finish
Feel:  Feels good I guess, but not nearly as creamy as Tree House Green.
Overall:  Citrus nose with a balanced hop presence that does not overpower but hits you right away, and stays with you before you finish and after words.   The Captains Daughter I am side by siding against the Sip leaves you with nearly the same hoppy goodness, but is not in your face right away.   I smell more citrus on the Sip as well.    Sip simply has more flavor.   But at a cost if pounding/drinking fast.    Captains Daughter would be easier to drink fast because the hops and citrus is more muted.   If you cant get Sip, then Captains Daughter would be a fantastic second choice in my area. 878 charactersShort-Pour, May 31, 2015

It was one of the first beers that blew my mind and kicked off my personal IPA fascination. A simple 2 ounce pour at a CBF a while ago was all it took. Now it is being distributed in MA. Unreal. Outstanding balance that starts with a golden, surprisingly clear pour. Fragrant floral and citrus aroma leads to a hop-forward taste that lingers until you take your next sip. Some tropical fruit from the citra with notes of pine. Alcohol is present and makes itself known by way of a little warmth at the back of the sip. Drinks crisp and finishes clean. Memory, hype or anything in between notwithstanding- it's an outstanding beer. 691 charactersManapuaMan, May 31, 2015

This layered DIPA provides cirus flavors on top of earthy tones that set this beer apart from others. The aromas are a bit funky but do not let them determine your rating. Light malt bill let the hops showcase in this brew. Impossible to find on the west coast but reasonable when trading with the east coast. I got a fresh can which is neccesary ith this beer. 433 charactersBradfordStuckey, May 26, 2015

A: Light orange, slightly hazy, a steady stream of tiny bubbles and a smooth, creamy two-finger head that lingers on and on

T: Bold. The grass and herbs are forward here along with pine and citrus zest. A hint of tropical fruit towards the finish
M: Medium-bodied, crisp and dry
O: This is very good. My only slight complaint is the herbs on the palate are a bit overpowering compared to the fruit notes but it's still a delicious beer to sip and highly recommended 594 charactersONUMello, May 24, 2015

A-  nice golden color with yellow hue and small white head.  Medium carbonation.
S-  lots of citrus fruits and zest, a small cut grass smell.
T-  very juicy and fresh tasting.  Pineapple, guava, and peach are apparent followed by just a quick grass and then biscuit finish.
M-  medium bodied, very quenching and crisp.  
O-  awesome job by Lawson's.  They seem to have all their beers down and continue to pump out winners.  Very recommendable. 494 charactersEveningCordial, May 23, 2015

Was on a Heady run and the local beer shop man pointed me at this beer. Couldn't find any in cans - unsurprisingly - but had it on tap, and enjoyed it thoroughly.
Great aroma - very floral, Heady-esque in that regard. It has the kind of bouquet that stays with you in a very pleasant way, and while it's got plenty of bitterness to it, it's not overwhelming or aggressive. A complex, delicious beer. Loved it. 485 charactersDeweyCheatem-n-Howe, May 23, 2015

4.45/5  rDev -2.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.516oz can, another stellar mule effort from doktorzee to get this white whale in front of me.  Given that today is sunny and pushing +30C in May, this seems like an appropriate offering.
This beer pours a mildly hazy, medium golden amber hue, with two fingers of puffy, densely foamy, and faintly bubbly off-white head, which leaves some splattered melting ice-shelf lace around the glass as things slowly bleed off.
It smells of crisp orange, white grapefruit, and lemon rind, further muddled fleshy tropical fruit notes, subtly dank pine needles, a somehow ethereal pale malt graininess, flinty hard water, and more herbal, floral, and lightly perfumed hops.  The taste is more tropical in its fruitiness up front, with pineapple core, kiwi, and papaya middling about, the domestic orange and red grapefruit coming in late, with some stoic musty pine resin, grainy caramel malt sweetness, plain flinty chalkiness, and more herbal, leafy, and restrained floral hops.
The bubbles are quite understated in their supportive and steadily frothy nature, the body a solid middleweight, and generally smooth, a small creaminess arising as things warm a tad.  It finishes off-dry, the assailed beyond typical belief malt carrying its flag with honor, while the tropical, local, herbal, and floral hops all continue to act out like there's no such thing as consequences.
Oh yeah, this is Vermont in a bottle (with a little bit of more pedestrian Connecticut, FWIW) - lots of green and fruity hops, over a corresponding malt bill that acknowledges its secondary role from the start.  It's cool to see this segmentation (ok, 'locality') of IPAs beginning to emerge throughout the States, as it can only foster more experimentation, extremity, and overall goodness, something I'm pondering as I sip away at the last of this tallboy, with the rays of sun streaming in. 1,859 charactersbiboergosum, May 22, 2015

Drank 5/16/15
Deep golden orange body and a persistent white foam.
Oh yes, a powerful hop aroma jumps out. All kinds of tropical action. Orange, grapefruit, tangerine, and passionfruit. A touch sweet and resiny.
Taste is really flavorful with grapefruit, pine, and tropical notes. I really dig the passion fruit and lychee type of thing going on. Has a firm bitterness and a fairly full mouthfeel.

Amazing nose on this. Just a ton of sweet citrus fruits and oily rinds along with some tropical fruits and nice pale malts coming through. Taste is much of the same, citrus fruits with a little tang, nice fruity hops and a light citrus rind bitterness. Malts are there just enough to keep the hops nicely balanced.
Fantastic ipa, get it if you can!! 483 charactersRutager, May 12, 2015

A - I prefer my IPAs filtered; it just makes them look cleaner.  This is clear as could be with a fluffy white head of an inch and a half.  Bubbles are streaming off the bottom of the glass.  Beautiful.
N - Not bitter at all.  Dank, but not bitter.  I get fresh citrus / fruit juice, like orange juice, grapefruit juice, pineapple juice?  Very nice.
T - To me this is like the younger brother of Double Sunshine.  I find that to be extremely spicy, and not at all clean.  The spice is still there on this one, but much more subdued.  Dank, bitter, piney hops round out the flavor.
M - Yeah!  Somehow all of the NE IPAs have this in common; the liquid turns to froth immediately in my mouth, as if I'm not even drinking; it's more like I'm eating cotton candy.  Not too dry on the finish, so I can really sip on it.
O - Definitely a winner. 867 charactersCraftFan5, May 11, 2015

Smell:  Flora, citrusy and tropical, with pink grapefruit, lychee, papaya and pith
Taste:  There is a sugary malt base that propels the hops along, but this is all about floral and citrusy hops; assertively pithy and, in addition to the hop elements detected in the aroma, there is also a hint of berry flavor
Mouthfeel:  Medium to full body with moderate carbonation
Overall:  This is a very nice DIPA but the hype machine is really rolling along; it's very good but it's not all that and a bag of chips

A - Pours a pale amber color trending towards golden, excellent clarity with a thick finger of bright, white and dense foam.
S - Lots of citrus and tropical fruits - grapefruit, pineapple, mango, a bit of lime.  Soft malt base barely shows.  Faint fruity, sugary sweetness.
T - Medium hop bitterness underneath lots of tropically fruity hops, light sugar, trace of pine.
M - Soft in feel with a lighter carbonation, lightish body.  Plenty of hops all around, a bit dry, bitter on the finish.
O - Excellent IPA...not the best I have ever had, but I would certainly like to have this again and often. 650 charactersportia99, May 09, 2015

A: Pours an electric, hazy orange-yellow color with a fizzy 1/2-finger white, bubbly head. 
S: Loads of orange, pineapple, tangerine, lemon, and grapefruit. All hops in the nose here. 
T: Orange, tangerine, melon, grapefruit. Just exploding with tropical fruit flavors. Some hints of coconut and lemon as well. Just enough malt balance to keep it from being overly bitter or resinous, and also allowing the hops the shine through.
M: Nice, full mouthfeel here, almost creamy. 8% ABV is well hidden. Again, not too bitter or resinous, although it is hovering on that line between IPA and DIPA. 
O: So I've had the pleasure of already trying Double Sunshine IPA before this one. That beer is still one of my favorite DIPAs of all time, so I was super excited about trying its little brother. Heading into it, I was expecting the same highlights of Double Sunshine, just in a tighter compact version. But what I really got was maybe just a slightly toned down version. More like a 1.5x IPA. This beer, while called an IPA, really drinks like a DIPA. It's big, it's bold, its hops coat your tongue, it's 8%. But concerns over style aside, this beer is still very damn good, if not great. There's IPAs and DIPAs out there that try hard to do what this beer does each year, but just can't. And so it's surprising that Lawson's can come out of nowhere in such a small time frame and nail it. This beer does the little things that other IPAs can't, like perfectly balance the malts to accentuate the hop characters, and create a pleasant drinking experience that isn't too bruising or bitter. Double Sunshine may be the better beer because it nails its category better, but Lawson's has a 1-2 punch here that not many other breweries can claim they have as well. 
Recommendation: Like most great beers from Vermont, it's incredibly hard to get, even if you live in the area. Nonetheless, this is mandatory drinking for the craft beer drinker. 2,034 charactersSparty1224, May 05, 2015

4.51/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Canned 4/13/2015.
Appearance - Pours a vibrant goldenrod color that is just hazy enough to blot out anything on the opposite side of the glass. Vigorous carbonation races through the beer to feed a dense, creamy head that lingers as long as the beer within the glass does. Splotchy remnants of lace spatter the glass.
Aroma - The nose pulses wave after wave of juicy tropical fruits with an underlying pinch of fresh floral notes. 
Taste - While the taste is just on point with the hops as the aroma, what distinguishes Sip of Sunshine from the competition is rush of sweetness that balances and complements the hops. The first few seconds are still all about the hops, which impart flavors of pineapple, grapefruit, mango, and orange, but in short order a supportive sweetness kicks in. 
Mouthfeel - Although the aroma and taste mask the 8%, the mouthfeel bears the brunt of the gravity. Both the hops and sweetness tag-team to weigh heavily on the palate, but at the same time it allows the flavors to develop well into the aftertaste. 
Closing Arguments - Lawson's delivers a winner with Sip of Sunshine. The hops are all that can be asked for, and the malt helps imply a semblance of balance. If you looked at the can design and expected a session Summer ale, you would think otherwise a few sips in, as this is every bit as heavy as a DIPA. 1,350 charactersnhindian, May 03, 2015

4.26/5  rDev -6.6%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 41 month old can, drinking very well
A - Hazy orange wheat body.  Fine bone white head pours a finger high with nice retation and lace.
S - Sweet, fruity nose.  Orange and grapefruit with a really nice soft nectarine center, with edges of sage, fresh bread crust, and a touch of booze.
T - Huge, straight up concentrated hop flavor.  The hop character is very raw and tastes almost straight off the vine, which on net is great but I'm a little ambivalent about.  The effect is big, herbal, and woody but at the same time almost astringent.  A touch of white bread, orange pith, and honey serve as a back drop but for the most part stay out of the way.
M - Medium body for a DIPA, medium-full for an IPA.  Pleasant carbonation.
O - A beer with a strong, almost aggressive, hop quality.  Based on the body, flavor profile, and to some degree the ABV I'd be more inclined to call this a DIPA than an IPA. 905 charactersvfgccp, Apr 28, 2015

Look - Bright, light orange. You can see through it. Thick white head. Good lacing. 
Smell - Dank tropical fruits. I smell lemon more than in a normal IPA.
Taste - Earthy tropical fruit. Vanilla and pine. Very wet. 
Feel - Smooth. Carbonation does not explode, but not flat.
Overall - How much percent is this? 8%?! You'll feel it, but won't taste the alcohol. I am glad I picked this up on the way out of Dark Lord Day! It is a perfect summer IPA in that it isn't too citrusy, but you appreciate the citrus. 552 charactersmadelfonatree, Apr 28, 2015

S- mango, stone fruit/peach juice, lemons
T- mango pulp, peach juice,oranges, lemon zest
M- not a lot of bitterness, it kind of rolls into a citrus zest bitter, subtle but nice, a little creamy, very smooth, doesn't linger much. It's very balanced
O- I thought this beer was good, but I've certainly had better. Really soft/subtle beer. Well crafter but I wouldn't seek it out 449 charactersEvahflow, Apr 28, 2015

A:  Tarnished orange, generally good clarity, with a vibrant rush of macro-effervesce filling the vessel. Stoic 2 inch bone white head, soapy large air pockets along the vessel walls, with a mountainious rising centerpiece, rigid and firm. Stratified ring lacing. 
S: Tropical freshness, wet mango, pineapple-orange with fresh lemon cream. Canned peach juice and a hint of fresh lime. 
T: Flavor started out with some grassy tropical fruitiness, slightly tart pineapple and lemon, and citrusy peach. Big burst of lightly dry orange finishing with a dry floral hop burst or orange, pine, and honey suckle flower. 
M: Light bready malt. Decent bite of crispness, medium bodie, lightly creamy textured.
O:  Insane drinkability, tropical  hopping perfect summer time quencher. Only a slight hint of the 8.0% which otherwise drinks like session material due to the light tropical fruity nature. Big wet tropical fruitiness that finishes with a warming of citrusy-pine hop flowers. Sip of sunshine is a sip of heaven. case worthy. 1,109 charactersbeerthulhu, Apr 26, 2015

4.7/5  rDev +3.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5An average head, very foamy and cloud-like in appearance, dissipates rather quickly but leaves phenomenal lacing. Golden appearance, mainly clear but a bit of hazy. Very floral nose with a nice bright citrus presence. A really nice balance of sweet and bitter which a touch of acidity. The flavour dance on your tongue and the malt keeps them all in balance. The finish is a touch of sweet and bitter that sticks around for quite some time.
An outstanding brew I'll bring home every time. I wish I could drink this regularly and all summer long. 546 charactersbyronic, Apr 22, 2015

Canned 3/20/15.
Pours a hazy golden-orange with a foamy beige head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of citrus fruit, citrus zest, and tropical fruit aromas. Taste is much the same with citrus zest and tropical fruit flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with great citrus and tropical hop qualities all around.

4.65/5  rDev +2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Received a bounty of fantastically fresh SoS thanks to fellow BA JamesonTrades. So much that I was compelled to share with some local beer friends of mine. Reviewing from my notes after enjoying this particular one on 2/28 out of a 16 oz can and poured into a Speigelau IPA glass. The bottom is marked with a canning date of 2/13, so it's just a baby at two weeks old.
Appearance (4.5) - Pours a slightly hazy amber yellow with highlights of spun gold and saffron lowlights. If I look hard, I can see a lazy trail of carbonation bubbles rising up through the slightly cloudy liquid to replenish a towering three-finger head reminiscent of meringue and the color of the tops of fluffy white cumulus clouds. Retention is excellent, with the foam lasting for longer than I'm willing to wait to drink my beer. The glass is imparted with sticky rings of lace after the foam has gone save for some patches of fluff on the surface of the glass.
Smell (5.0) - Hard to describe this any other way than "wow". The initial burst is filled with tropical profiles, strong notes of mango and passionfruit, with subtler suggestions of clementine and citrus zest to give the softer tropical flavors a bit of bite. There is a hint of the underlying malt base, but it's clearly only present to provide a vehicle for the explosion of fruity hop characteristics. The smell is so lush and intoxicating that it's hard to imagine the taste possibly living up to my now lofty expectations.
Taste (4.5) - Sadly, the taste was doomed to take a back seat to that juicy aromatic explosion from the get-go. That said, the taste holds it's own quite well. The mango and passionfruit again make their presence known, with now some more astringent grapefruit notes and citrus zest. The taste may not be quite as dynamic and over-the-top as the aroma, but it's still quite amazing. Often times, I find double IPAs to have bit more of that bready malt presence than I would prefer, but the rub is that losing the malt often loses some of the luscious, juicy body that is needed to maintain balance. In this case, Lawson's seems to have found the perfect balance of malt to carry the hoppy goodness without trying to steal the show.
Mouthfeel (4.75) - Picking up where I left off with the taste, the body of this double IPA is close to perfect. Juicy and full feeling in the mouth, but not heavy or overbearing. Carbonation is moderate and the finish is semi-dry.
Overall (4.5), this is a stellar beer. I have no idea how well it holds up to time, because I was unable to resist drinking all of my cans before they had even reached the three-week-old point. I'm not sure if I'd go as far as to say this is better than Heady Topper (although I'm pretty sure my score may reflect as much), but it's certainly in the conversation. For all intents and purposes, the two Vermont DIPA heavyweights are in a dead heat. Both are excellent, and in their own ways. 2,924 charactersLambicPentameter, Apr 14, 2015

Had 6 now and every time I pick out something different to like.  Solid beer all around.  Tons of hops in the smell, taste and feel. Believe it all citra over and over. Creates a great smell and taste but it does burn out a bit and the bitter tends to build up.  Overall, great beer, and will drink as many as I can get my hands on. 341 characterssjones5045, Apr 12, 2015

A: Orange, slightly cloudy. Finger of head.

T: Pine upfront, followed by citrus and tropical fruit flavors. Finishes dry with lingering pine. Nicely balanced with some malt in the background.
M: Medium carbonation, decent body. Finishes up dry. 
O:  A lot of IIPAs come close to being pure hop juice, this has a nice balance for a style that's defined by lack of balance. Overall a great example of the style. 548 characterschrisjws, Apr 10, 2015

16oz Tallboy to Beecher Pint
Thanks Bahnfire
App- A bright orange with a mild center of golden yellow with a bit of flecked peach pink to it. A lot of bubbles come floating up. A nice frothy and fluffy 2-1/2” head with a pure white color to it. A long retention period with good lacing to it.
Smell- I am always hesitant when a can states just how lush or tropical something is. I was pleasantly surprised by this one. A nice and wonderful aroma came up with big tropical notes. A great balance of hop oils with a semi sweet aroma.
Taste- It’s a very good IPA. These east coast IPAs are more lush and creamy and have a great hoppy balance to them. As mentioned in the above section, my skepticism over the tropical was short lived. A great amount of fruit flavors came out. Not overly bitter and was very crisp and clean. The 4 pk didn’t stand a chance.
Mouth- A good and solid medium body with a lusher leaning medium carbonation. A very nice layer or clean hops and balance tropical fruits.
Drink- It was good, Don’t get me wrong. Just expected more. Was thinking more HT level. 1,113 charactersFosterJM, Apr 02, 2015

Was super excited when I read about this beer and saw the 100 ba rating. Unfortunate that I don't see it, but the flavor profile was not for me. Did not get a glimpse of floral or citrus AT ALL. For me it's a bitter hoppy booze ridden ipa, that is very mildly carbonated. I can feel the boozy heat in my stomach. It's not that I dislike this beer at all but I don't think it lived up to my expectations of dipa due to the amount of wonderful ones I have had lately. 520 charactersHoppedChef84, Mar 31, 2015

4.35/5  rDev -4.6%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25I had tried Sip of Sunshine three months ago.  Was unimpressed, but to be fair I gave it a second shot this past weekend.
I decided that while it is definitely a quality made beer, the taste is just not for me.
I taste a very dank hop presence, not citrus/fruity as all as advertised.
My prefererance for IPAS has always been for the sweet taste with citrus/floral/graprefuit hop profile.  This is very bitter /resiny on the palate.
I wanted to love this beer.  I could not.   Can name 8-10 beers from my home state of CT that blow this out of the water. 558 charactersjcflorian, Mar 30, 2015

A - Pours a slightly hazy golden honey color. Nice head and lacing. 
S - Bright, fresh floral and hoppy aroma. Fruity, piney. Very nice. Not overpowering like other beers but very pleasant. 
T - Juicy and hoppy. Not a strong malt backbone which is fine for me. A bit more fruity than citrusy, more tropical. Reminds me of Jai Alai. 
A very nice beer and look forward to trying more and trying the double version! 460 charactersericdavidmorris, Mar 28, 2015

Light sticky lacing all the way down.  The aroma is fantastic.  Very East coast feel with dank earthy piney tones.  The taste followed perfectly.  Could maybe use a bit more malt for balance in the mouthfeel but that is nit-picking.  Nice lingering hop bitterness in the finish.  Not astringently bitter but a nice reminder that you are drinking a big beer.  Overall, excellent example of the brewing arts. 504 charactersKidDoc, Mar 25, 2015
4.44/5  rDev -2.6%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5My first moment tasting the beer occurred in...São Paulo?!? I was shipped a pair of cans which were brought to Fil's apartment, and part of the reward is taking part of tasting it. From a 16 ounce can, on to the beer:
A soapy head with fair retention sits on the top of this glowing electric orange color of a brew. Not to be let down, the aroma comes out with a cornucopia of fruity smells. Out comes cantaloupe, orange, grapefruit, grass, kiwi...nicely done! 
One flaw I could think of is that this beer could have a wee more malt presence. That being said, the performance of those lupulins is outstanding. The beer is quite clean, all sorts of tropical fruit juices from passionfruit to orange keep the palate in a happy mood. Paired with a medium full body and no none of that hop bitterness, I suspect it is similar to a sip of sunshine. 
Excellent beer and worth talking about. 888 charactersDoubleJ, Mar 25, 2015

LOOK: Honey gold leaning to orange. Dense foamy white head that lingers and coats the glass. Nice lacing. Slightly cloudy. Hold it up to the light and watch some of those bubbles dance.
SMELL: Paradise. Tropical fruits (pineapple, mango, citrus citrus citrus) and light floral notes.
TASTE: Those tropical fruit aromas are there on the taste buds immediately and open in a big way. Bitterness is present on the finish as an assertive bite, but it doesn't linger.

I got to try this once so far and it was incredible but I also had a toothache which prevented me from making an in-depth review or enjoying it as fully as I could. I nonetheless determined it to be one of my top 5 IPA's. Would love to grab this again. It literally tastes and smells and FEELS like the tropical vacation it promises on the can.

A - Mildly hazy, golden-orange with a 2.5-finger pillowy white head, a light touch of sediment and very nice lace.  BTW, the can itself looks really refreshing.
S - Orange, pineapple, honeysuckle, fresh hop buds that are a little dank and very floral.  
T - Fresh, juicy oranges, pineapple, grapefruit, peach and papaya sweetness with a touch of light malt.   The refreshing, outdoorsy flavors of pine and mint compliment the present-but-moderate bitterness delivered by the various hop flavors that ebb and flow on the tongue (and nose).  The aftertaste continues these same flavors;  and remains well balanced; slightly favoring hop bitterness.  
M - Medium body and low-medium carbonation.  Smooth, sticky, creamy, resinous and just lightly prickly.  
O - A great DIPA; nearing the lofty heights of Double Sunshine. 976 charactersTucquan, Mar 22, 2015

Look is somewhat clear which is unusual because most of the east coast IPAs I drink are unfiltered. Smell is hoppy but yet citrusy. Initial taste is citrus with some tarts layering on my tongue. This is sort of like alpine Nelson but without the spicy taste. It's also more drinkable than Nelson. The main problem is the after taste that I get. 362 charactersjooler, Mar 22, 2015

A- golden, straw-yellow color with a thick, foamy white head. Lots of lace. 
S- lots of piney and citrus hop notes. Lemon, orange peel, grapefruit. Wow!
T- same citrus notes lead the way with a slight bitter hop aspect. Sweet and resiny!
M- perfect! No other way to describe it. Everything comes together nicely!  Best feel of any DIPA/IPA I've had.

Smell: Honestly, best smelling beer i've ever had. Pine with intense smells of orange, grapefruit, lemon peel. The most appetizing, wake-me-up smelling beer i've ever come across
Taste: Exactly like the nose hops are forward and mingle and dance with the intense citrus notes of grapefruit, orange, lemon, and melon. Quite honestly the best tasting beer i've ever experienced. Very little beers would make me smile like this and ever fewer have a flavor that is pleasant at any time. I can't imagine a scenario where this wouldnt just empirically taste amazing. 
Feel: Just right. Has a sense of thickness you expect from juice but retains the classic 2xIPA lingering mouthfeel. Perfection
Overall: Perfection. Can't think of a beer that does everything that this beer does this well. The hype is warranted and then some. 895 charactersYeahRightt, Mar 19, 2015

It was one of the top 20 beer experiences of my life. I would have drank myself into a happy, hoppy stupor, but alas I was on work assignment and had to drive home. I'm going back there in a month praying that it is there again. Drove home with a case of Heady Toppers and two four packs of Sip Of Sunshine. This is a good St. Patricks Day for this Irishman. 
The owner also gave me a sample of another Lawsons offering whose name escapes me. I can say that it was incredible. Keep an eye on this brewery. If you see Lawsons, pick some up. These folks can brew some beer. Thank you Lawsons. See you soon. 721 charactersDrumsOnTap, Mar 17, 2015

is filled with sediment floating around. Two fingers of creamy
thick white head. Good retention and lacing is sticky.
S: Fresh. Pine. Citrus. Grapefruit. Hops. Caramel. Sweet. Fruity. 
Resin. Hops. 
T/M: Strong hop flavors. Bitter. Grapefruit. Other citric flavors. 
Some fruity sweet flavors. More hops and some resin. Now a
little sweet malts. Only a slight alcohol taste. Medium bodied. 
Creamy. The finish is a little sweet with some linger of resin.
O: The beer is like a rush of hops and sharp flavors to the head.
After the initial taste the beer becomes a little more complex
with malts and fruity flavors. Pretty Great. Upper echelon.

It's good but not DS good.
Peach colored with a moderate haze
Faint tangerine smell with some floral notes
Nice balance between hops and malt, but the hops don't shine like they do in DS.
Overall it's a great DIPA, but not on par with DS and the rest of NE's other great DIPA's. 338 charactersHorbar, Mar 16, 2015

Bright nose. Orange juice and peach, conifer, bit of biscuit. 
The taste more or less follows suit. Tropical fruits and a super mild bitterness that allows those more delicate flavors to linger. Really soft on that palate. 
Not quite as clean and crisp as some of its relatives but for an 8% beer, this is a homerun. 426 charactersramay86, Mar 16, 2015

4.92/5  rDev +7.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5For lack of a more appropriate colloquialism; this beer is the absolute balls. 
The pour is an ever so slightly hazy golden orange color with a nice, fluffy white head. Great retention and some decent lacing. 
The aroma is an orgy of citrus fruits and dank, grassy pungency. There are notes of orange, grapefruit, tangerine, and pineapple. The malt is subtle, but provides a nice, fresh baked bread character. The aroma leans on the sweet side, but there's plenty of grass and even some spicy pepper to keep it from being cloying. 
The taste is unsurprisingly very citrusy, with notes of juicy orange and fresh tangerine. There's also a bit of grapefruit and even some mango. The bitter hops are also very present, and the sweet and bitter notes are basically cuddling in the glass watching Game of Thrones. Like the aroma, the malt is subtle but adds a nice doughy character to the flavor. There's even some caramel sweetness hiding around. 
The feel is medium bodied with medium carbonation. Incredibly creamy and smooth, yet despite the 8% ABV remains crisp and refreshing.
Overall, this beer. This. Beer. Every bit as good as Heady Topper and in some ways perhaps even better. It's incredibly well balanced. It's juicy and sweet, yet bitter and piney. The malt is not a main character but is more like a supporting character that deserves far more recognition and maybe even a Golden Globe nomination. Truly one of the best beers I've ever had. 1,453 charactersScaryEd, Mar 13, 2015

4.52/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Just got back from a successful trip to Vermont.  So, might as well start drinking at 3:30 pm.  'Cause, that's what you do when you get back from Vermont.  Hey, what the hell, I woke up at 4 am, might as well start now and go to bed at 8.
First sip of The Sip ever, and I have high expectations.  But FIRST...let's clear some things up.  People love to antagonize the battle between Heady and [insert VT IPA here].  To be honest, what I was expecting here was another Heady clone, trying to emulate, but what I found was a completely different beer in its own right.  At certain points I will refer to Heady for clarification, but what Lawson's has created here is a beer of its own.  Props to them for creating something that lives up to the Vermont standard, and maybe even raise it, while not being an emulator.  SoS is SoS.  Heady is Heady.  Let's get over that now.  NOW...
A: OK, it looks like an IPA.  That golden/amber/orange color, opaque, decent head, all that jazz.  Fine.
S: What is dis...?  It's so fruity, but...I can't wrap my head around it.  It's not that typical grapefruit tangerine stuff.  It's like...all citrus but not quite...it's sweet...is it just fruit?  No...wait a sec... there is pine in there!  Plenty of pine, actually.  It's just so balanced, it somehow ADDS to the citrus.  It complements the perception of sweet citrus fruit, somehow.  I've wasted my smelling capacity and still haven't figured it out.  Props for creating something so delicately perfected!  It's pungent, yes, but that's not what does it.  It's that "wait, let me smell that again..." factor.  Very complex and balanced smell.  Whereas Heady is definitely, as they say, meant to be drank from the can, this beer is meant to be poured.  One of the most impressively created smells I've experienced in an IPA.
T: Hmm.  It's no Heady (read introduction for disclaimer).  Not quite the same as the smell.  It's very bitter relative to other 8%-ers.  Kinda creates a bitter grapefruit sensation, but overall the bitterness overpowers the sweetness that the malt creates and it is not as addicting to drink as others.  Better than a lot, not as good as a lot.  Right in the middle.  Still, that great smell is wrapped up in the flavor, and it's nice.  Just not as prominent as it is in the smell.  
M: Wow, this is thick!  Each mouthful is huge and drips down your throat.  Probably the thickest I've had of an 8% IPA.  Personally, I love it.  It doesn't chug, it is savored.  Perfect carbonation to complement the thickness.  
O: Sip of Sunshine is Sip of Sunshine.  It's a unique and expertly crafted creation in its own right.  It's not Heady, but it's not meant to be compared to Heady.  It's an amazingly-made beer and has great, unique qualities.  Props to Lawson's for further adding to the legend of Vermont IPAs. 2,823 charactersakrz47, Mar 12, 2015

Can poured into tulip.  Pours an orange copper hazy color with a really nice 1 finger white head.  Aromas of orange, grapefruit, mango, papaya just pour out..smells wonderful.  Taste follows all the great tropical notes..big grapefruit, juicy oranges, citrus, some pine.  Wonderfully balanced, moderate bitterness. Medium mouthfeel, creamy, well carbonated.

16 oz can w/o any freshness/canning date indication that I can make any sense of.
Pours hazed/clouded dull tangerine  with a bunch of fine sediment floating around.  Lasting eggshell head leaving nice low sheeting and bands of thicker lacing
A deep sniff reveals oranges in all their glory.
Fresh and flavorful, with notes of oranges, mango, grapefruit.  Super tropical and highly enjoyable,
Smooth, smooth smooth on the tongue and around the mouth. Carbonation seemingly on the low side, adding do the smooth nature of this offering.

Served in a becker
The beer poured a golden amber color and was topped by a small, creamy, bright white cap of froth. Solid head retention. The crown deposited a patchy latticework of lacing along the top portion of the glass.
Fantastic aroma. Super hoppy and fruity. Tropical fruit notes dominated. Mango, passionfruit and papaya came through strongest. Moderate citrus presence. Grapefruit was noticeable. Touch of orange peel. As the beer sat, the tropical fruitiness decreased and the citrus notes intensified.
The flavor profile was solid but not quite as complex or as smooth as the nose. Citrus notes were most apparent. Grapefruit came through super strong. Loads of orange and orange peel. Some mango as well. The beer was anchored by a semi-sweet, crystal malt backbone that was merely strong enough to temper the hoppy bitterness. Pithy grapefruit rind-like notes appeared in the finish. A bit of pine also came through.
The mouthfeel was lighter bodied for the style and pillowy soft. Super frothy and fluffy. The liquid contained a fine, zippy effervescence.
Aside from Double Sunshine, I find most of Lawson's beers to be overhyped and overrated. Sip of Sunshine definitely falls into this camp. I would be very happy to have this as a local offering but would not go to great efforts to seek it out. 1,369 charactersDamian, Mar 08, 2015

3.65/5  rDev -20%look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Thanks to irishrogue for this lovely 16 oz. can with “sunshine” on it, which makes me feel better after an interminable couple months of clouds & cold here in cheery MN. Can dated 1/23/15.
The pour is a muted orange, lightly carbonated. It’s a bit tough to blow the Fou out of my nose, but this smells just like Halos, minus the easy peeling. All orange, all the time. 
Sip of Sunshine is an apt metaphor for the liquid pouring into my biggest head orifice. Big huge sunshine energy has turned into oranges & mangos, with a backing quartet of sweet candy. Bitterness only arrives mid-palate & is more mildly irate than bitter (although my burps taste awesome), along with a slight herbal quality, touch of dust, orange creamsicle. Nicely resinous, thick in the hips, the mouthfeel might be the pinnacle here. Although I could pound down a few of these. 
Not quite all it’s banged up to be, but I wouldn’t kick it out of bed for eating cream cheese. Good beer. 972 charactersmaximum12, Mar 07, 2015

This is very good but I'd be hard pressed to put it in my top five or past some local options. 514 charactersHopBomb515, Mar 05, 2015

4.59/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Really an outstanding beer, with considerable tropical fruit, light pine and considerable hoppy bitterness.  The beer has a nice juicy quality that's really great to see in this beer as well.  The finish is dry, bitter and long, and the alcohol is well integrated into the flavor profile.  This DIPA is quite well balanced, with everything seemingly in perfect perportion.
Just an all around excellent DIPA.
Edit from 5/17.  Just got back from a trip to the NE, which included a couple day stay over in the Waterbury/Stowe area.  SOS was all over the place on tap, so I was able to sample it repeatedly.  After a number of purchases of this great beer, it became apparent that my original review score needed a slight revision (upward).  Definitely one of the top 10 DIPA's I've ever had! 790 charactersJohn_M, Feb 28, 2015

4.52/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Can from trade as an extra. Killer! Thanks man. Pours golden with a slight haze and a creamy fluffy white one to two finger head. Aroma is pine and strong florals, lightly sweet malt notes, more floral hops. Nice. Flavor is dry up front with definite floral piney hops, light citrus rind though not super juicy, much more dryness here. What seems to be a characteristic Lawson's yeast flavors. Medium bodied and on the dry side, slight resin, medium plus carbonation. Nice beer and way too easy drinking for 8%. This is delicious, but the huge score seems to put it in the overhyped category. But that's nitpicking. I'd drink this every day.
The more I have this, the more I realize there really isn't anything this fantastic readil my available. And everyone I share it with goes nuts for it, even if not a beer geek. Good stuff. Going down as a classic. 856 charactersBMMillsy, Feb 28, 2015

Hazy honey colored with traces of carbonation leads to a white one finger foamy cap. Settles to a thin white layer with a few tracings.

4.62/5  rDev +1.3%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5The pour yields a slightly hazy golden-orange with a pillowy white head.  Pungent ripe tropical fruits fill the nose, mango, guava, papaya, with a bit of stone fruit.  There is a fuzziness to the smell that draws you in, enticing you with the promise of the first sip.
The first sip follows the nose and gives way to overripe mango the most prevalent of many tropical fruits, floral hints, along with tangerine and orange marmalade.  There are honey and cracker undertones, but the malt is definitely in the back seat while the hops drive.  Nice and punchy yet smooth bitterness which leaves a slight dry grassy aftertaste.  The mouthfeel is delightful and it gets better as the beer warms.  
One of the most impressive aspects of this beer is it continues to develop and really opens up as it warms.  Instead of falling apart like many of its brethren, it soars to heights few in its class can reach.  Plenty of hype surrounding this fine brew but it stands up to all of it in my opinion.  I consider myself fortunate to be able to have access to this wonderful brew fairly regularly. 1,087 charactersOntheLambic, Feb 23, 2015

Appearance: A turbid and hazy golden-yellow with a touch of orange. Huge, billowy white head with lots of small bubbles rising through the beer. Heavy lacing on the glass throughout drinking.
Aroma: So juicy and fresh smelling. Reeks like tropical fruit, with tons of citrus and mango and passionfruit. The can points to a tropical flavor with it's bright yellow color, and the smell matches that. Really inviting and refreshing in the dead of Rhode Island winter.
Taste: One of the most juicy and citrusy IPAs I've ever encountered. Absolutely delicious, and crazy juicy. Only mild bitterness, overwhelmed by layers of fruit and flora aroma.
Feel: Crisp, smooth, and somewhat thick. Drinks wet and juicy but finishes dry and leaves a lingering refreshing feeling in the mouth.
Overall: One of the top IPAs I've ever had; this one can definitely go toe-to-toe with any New England IPA, including Heady Topper. The relatively prevalent availability makes this one a go-to. Fantastic! 1,042 charactersTheElectricOne, Feb 22, 2015

4.86/5  rDev +6.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Look:  Golden in color; slightly hazy; lots of small bubbles.  Pours with a rich, creamy 2 finger head that dies down rather quickly leaving a thin uneven layer on the surface of the beer.  Looks inviting.
Smell:  Mild hoppy - citrus aroma, tropical.  Delicious; made me want to drink the beer.
Taste:  Similar to how it smells.  Mild, slightly dry hoppy taste combined with citrus/lemony flavor.  Very refreshing.
Feel:  Medium body, slight fizz from the carbonation, with a very slight dry finish.  Refreshing and near perfect.
Overall:  Delicious flavor; very refreshing.  Near perfect.  I could drink this over and over.  One of the best IPAs ever in my opinion. 670 characterssprat1960, Feb 18, 2015

4.34/5  rDev -4.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25We crack a tallboy, pouring into our oversized tasting snifters.  It shines the color of a ripe Georgia peach.  A powdery, snowy two finger head of white sand colored bubbles adorns this liquid, standing tall and retaining well.  It is also highly reproducible.  Thick sheeted cheesecloth lacing is left around our glasses.  Chill is definitely apparent, as are some tight dots of sediment with the dregs of the can.  Carbonation appears to be mild.  The aroma is bright and natural, with hoppy varietals spanning citric to densely piney, bittering and serious lemon zest, spicy pale and earthy amber maltiness, fresh tomato acidity, pineapple and pear fruity mealiness, tin, warmed Granny Smith apples, green acorns, tight juniper stickiness, mineral-laden clay water, succulents, dried spaghetti, peppery spiciness, celery salt, and fresh spring dew.  The flavoring gives creamy pale and wheaty maltiness at the forefront of the sip, dried rye and soaked barley, intensely floral and citric hoppy wash, cantaloupe and bitter grapefruity pith, under ripe pear and white grapes, dusty wool, mineral and metallic simple ale yeastiness, dried willow bark and honeysuckle, organic well water, tangerine flesh, vanilla extract, fusel booze, and stale white chocolate peppermint bark.  The body is medium, and the carbonation is lightly medium.  Cream and froth are up there, and slurp and smack are nice as well, but leave little room for a crisp finishing pop.  However, the fact that it finishes so cleanly to flavor makes us happy regardless.  The mouth is cooled, coated, and creamed, with lingering bittering astringency to pull us into a mild pucker.  The abv is appropriate, and the beer disappears at a nice pace.
Overall, this is an intensely serious use of hops right here.  Through both the aroma and flavoring you get this wonderfully fresh, authentic, sappy, fruity, robust, and uniquely Vermont-garden quality to the hops.  They seem unadulterated in their clean bitterness, with enough energy left in the end to offer a respite of sweetness to the ultimate balance.  The finish is thus clean and easy to palate, all while remaining excitingly flavorful and organically bitter.  This muddies subtly with warmth, so drink on the chillier side.  Again, we would like to give a thankful shout out to Joe at CT Liquors for pulling this one out for us.  Initially, we were kind of surprised to see it in his hand.  Having had to drive up to Vermont to a random little store to even find a random bottle of their stuff in the past, we hadn’t previously been aware of their collaborative brewing partnership with Two Roads out of Connecticut.  Thankfully, my upbringing in the state brought us home for the holidays, and thus, this beer to our possession, but it is always nice to be surprised in this wonderful world of craft beer. 2,838 charactersTheBrewo, Feb 10, 2015

Appearance:  A one finger head was poured that reduced to a thin layer.  It is a hazy golden yellow with good clarity and vision of bubbles coming up through the glass.  Super frothy lacing down the glass as the beer was drank too. 
Smell:  Super tropical, melon, apricot, peach, canteloupe, juicy, citrus, floral, herbal, toasted, bready, and pale malts.  
Taste:  Wow!!!  I do actually feel like I'm on a tropical island.  Balanced, flavorful, great malt profile, and extremely delicious.
Mouthfeel:  Smooth, refreshing, medium bodied, medium carbonation, and nice tingly bitterness. 
Overall:  Will have to say that this is one of the best IPA'S I've ever had.  Hope to revisit this one again in the near future.  Well worth it. 776 charactersFlounder57, Feb 09, 2015

Poured into a snifter at my table. Pours a slightly hazy golden sunny body with a 2 finger white head that reduces to a ring of foam.. Not much lacing.
Aroma is fruity, juicy. Pineapple, mango, passion fruit, citrus, light malt.
Absolutely delicious, big tropical fruits on the tongue, following the nose with a hoppy bite on the finish. Easy drinker, medium body and medium carbonation.
Everything I expected! Half a notch below heady. 500 charactersgcamparone, Feb 06, 2015

A - Tall-boy pours to a big ol snifter hazy orange with a white head. Nice full cap and bits of lace left. Looks good in said big ol snifter.
S - Tangerines, dank, grapefruit, bit of mango, good all-around general tropical grassiness, light sugar cookie malt. Decent strength.
T - Taste steps up a bit with more strength and a bit more complexity. Nice orange/grapefruit/tropical/weedy hop mix with some floral there as well. Sweet and biscuity malt is slight but provides a nice semi-backbone.
M - Smooth, good body, nice swishy medium carbonation, somewhat high bitterness with good malt backing, very solid and quite drinkable.
O - Definitely a very nice DIPA but maybe not quite as remarkable as some other top tier ones coming out nowadays. That being said - really really good. I actually  have had better experiences with this than my few with Double Sunshine. 1,029 charactersChico1985, Feb 06, 2015

5/5  rDev +9.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I never want to just hand out all 5's to a beer. I actually look for negatives and things I didn't like as a consumer of the product so I can fairly rate it. This was my first time drinking Sip of Sunshine and I was very impressed. 
It looks wonderful. It has a golden amber hue which is very pleasant. 
The smell is amazing. It's what I expect out of an IPA. I don't want to smell harsh malt in my IPAs. I smell very floral and tropical notes coming through which lets me know what to expect when I taste it. 
The taste is amazing. It's hoppy, tropical, light, slightly bitter, and very drinkable. I'm sure the yeast plays a role in the flavor. It's what I'm looking for. 
The feel is flawless. I can't say anything negative. It's smooth. I don't know how you can rate it any other way. 
Overall this what I'm looking for in an IPA. If you want a malt bomb, then this beer is not for you. If you're not an IPA drinker, I think this beer would turn you onto IPAs. But, you will definitely be spoiled when you try other beers. 
I try to rate on style. IPAs are my favorite style so I am more critical when I approach a new to me IPA. Every beer has subtle differences that each of us like more than others. I just happen to like this style of IPA more than others.  I'm sorry. I couldn't find a flaw with it. Maybe that I don't have more of it! 1,349 charactersDroopy487, Feb 05, 2015

The nose featured dank hop aromas of resinous pine, fresh pineapple, juicy oranges, and sweet malts that blend together beautifully. The mouth was nothing short of amazing; flavors of zesty oranges and ripe pineapple are prevalent up front, followed by notes of grapefruit, papaya, and caramel malts on the back end. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, with a flavor bursting finish that sets it apart from any other standard IPA. I've been looking for Sip for quite a while now, and my buddy, @billylightning delivered. This is truly an outstanding brew and is easily in my top five for best American IPA. 100/100 839 charactersthebeerfrontier, Jan 24, 2015

A: Half finger wide head. White colour. Nice soft complexion. Good consistency. Retention is about 3 minutes. Body is a vibrant copper.
Sm: Lemon, lemon zest, pale malts, fresh citrus, some skunky herbal hops. Mild to moderate aromatic intensity.
T: Lemon zest, herbal hop character, pale malts. Good balance and build, with plenty of subtlety. Hints of mango and tangerine. 
Mf: Smooth, wet, medium-bodied, refreshing, crisp, and approachable. Accentuates the hop profile nicely.
O: Very drinkable and enjoyable. Still one of the best beers in the style I've tried.
High B
***
Found my notes from Fall 2014. Shared by a friend in Austin, TX. 
HEAD: 1 finger wide. Fluffy and soft looking. Creamy smooth consistency. Nice complexion. No lacing. 5-7 minute retention.
BODY: Hazy unfiltered copper colour. Murky with orange hues. No yeast or hop sediment is visible. Appears well-carbonated, albeit of average vibrance.
The orange hues make it quite attractive, but it isn't a unique appearance. I'm looking forward to trying it.
AROMA: Orange citrus zest. Pale malts. Grapefruit. Bitter rind. Pleasant floral hop notes.
Very fresh and fragrant. Damned appealing, yet mild in terms of intensity. No alcohol, overt yeast, or off-notes are detectable.
Hops seem well paired to the malts. The freshness of the citrusy zest is startling. Faint tones of peach and tangerine emerge as I explore the aroma. A hint of mango.
The fruity notes are just fantastic. 
Not a soapy aroma by any means.
TASTE: Citrusy zest is fantastic as the aroma suggests, and it's beautifully complemented by subtle hints of mango, tangerine, floral notes, and even some slight grapefruit/rindy bitter bite. Pale malts provide the malt foundation, lending just enough sweetness to balance out the hop bitterness without overdoing it or tending towards cloying territory.
Impressively well-balanced. Nice depth of flavour. The freshness of the flavours is amazing, helping each constituent note feel distinct in the build. Average duration and intensity of flavour. Has nice subtlety. It's a good overall build for an imperial IPA, boasting impressive cohesion. It's a gestalt build, exceeding the sum of its parts.
My main critique is that the grapefruit bitterness is a bit too much on the climax, slightly disturbing the otherwise impeccable balance.
TEXTURE: Smooth, wet, soft, refreshing, and surprisingly light-bodied for such a high ABV beer. Complements the taste harmoniously. Supple.
Not oily, gushed, hot, astringent, or harsh. Very approachable.
OVERALL: While the tinge of bitterness on the climax holds it back from true greatness, it remains a damn solid imperial IPA well worthy of its lofty reputation. I could finisha growler in one sitting with ease, and would happily snatch this up wherever I saw it. Well worth trying. One to seek out when in Vermont. The freshness of the fruit is divine, but I'm not so keen on the lingering bitterness.
B+ / VERY GOOD

Look -The beer looked great with a perfect amount of head.  
Smell -The smell was citrus and melon.  
Taste - The taste was citrus and melon with a sweet malt backbone.  
Feel - The beer was just about perfect.  Not thin but not to heavy.  There does seem to be a residual film in my mouth (I could be getting sick so..)
As the beer warmed the citrus aroma and taste became really pronounced.  This was an awesome IIPA. 511 charactersClint_Yoho, Jan 22, 2015

4.76/5  rDev +4.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5L: Slightly hazy brass tone. Faint orange hue in the head when poured but as it thins it appears much whiter. Very delicate lacing.
S: So many different smells come through with this beer, from start to finish. Pineapple, grapefruit, mangos, peaches, I've even picked up hints of garlic and green onion. Not at all funky though, despite the myriad of aromas.
T: Very complex flavor profile--mostly tropical flavors with a nice citrus counterbalance. Just enough malt to let the hops do their thing but not crush your palate with overt bitterness. 
F: Fantastic carb, body is spot on and no booziness. 
O: So on point. This is a beer that lives up to the hype in my opinion. Not only does it smell and taste amazing, but it's also meticulously crafted. 751 charactersCayseyW, Jan 17, 2015

This is the beer i pray for the moment before I open a new ipa in a can. Don't misunderstand, it's by no means the quintessential IIPA but it is gooooood. Smell is filled with tropical fruit, hop resin hits hard, lupulin-laden is the perfect description both in feel and flavor; bitterness is almost to much but as long as you let it diffuse in a glass for a minute it drinks perfect. Complaint I have, and yes only one, is the aroma is harsh at times; kinda nail polish remover. 588 charactersBerkshireGuerrilla, Jan 15, 2015

4.59/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Delectable in its supreme hop glory- Lawson's Finest continues to both tease and mesmerize hop-heads with tangy citrus, deep tropical and herbal waft layering gently upon one another.
Pouring with patient separation of hazy golden-peach elixir from its cottony lather, the unadulturated and unfiltered ale has a rustic but genuine appearance. The nose is awash with vibrant grapefruit, tropical punch, and hints of chive with cannabis frame the hoppy scent while a backdrop of caramel and honey give the fruit impressions a more tantalizing fructose and honeysuckle character.
What starts sweet with candied citrus and tropical fruit quickly asserts its hop flavors to overcome the weight of caramelized malt. The bitter tang of red grapefruit, blood orange, pineapple, mango, lemon and passionfruit shed its over-ripened form and favor a dried, almost musty fruit character before its bitterness steals the show.
Trending malty-dry, the medium-bodied ale finishes with a semi-light and creamy  body that wraps around the smooth, resiny bitterness- giving impressions of citrus peel, pepper, botanical grasses and something only described as a "funky-freshness". It's a mystical ale that seduces each and every tastebud with unabashed appology. 1,247 charactersBEERchitect, Jan 15, 2015

Poured from a 16oz can dated 7/10/15 into a tulip glass. 
Appearance is a beautiful hazy orangish-gold color with approximately a half-finger of head.  Very citrusy smell and the taste follows suit with a perfect hint of a hop bitterness finish.  The name says it all, it's sunshine in a can.   Mouthfeel loses a tick as its nearly perfect effervescence fades towards the end.  A must have for IPA lovers that makes you always looking to hunt it down anytime you're in its limited distribution area. 546 charactersclake, Jan 11, 2015

The pour produces a frothy and creamy head a couple fingers thick. Body is orange and cloudy with trickles carbonation. 4.5
Bright citrusy and floral nose. Piney and resinous below. 4.25
Tasty first sip is mango followed by a malty, somewhat caramel-like flavor with a touch of passionfruit. It's hugely fruity, but then it takes a lemony turn that mingles with sweetness until the finish. 4.5
For a bigger beer, this is smooth and devoid of alcohol. Carbonation is low to medium, the body is medium and almost chewy, with a moderately bitter finish.  4.5
Pretty damn flawless. Juicy and rich, even a month and a half from bottling. 697 charactersONovoMexicano, Jan 05, 2015

Pours a sunny, glowing, yellow color, with a huge froth head.
Has aromas of, grass, pine, as well as tropical, slightly unripe grapefruit with a lemon bite to it. Bready, malty qualities become recognizable beneath the hoppiness, leaving the focus on the fruit, while adding a subtle honeyed hint.
The hoppiness straight from the very beginning is remarkable, defined by grass and lemon rind, which settles above dough, bready malts, as well as an increasing fruitiness, which blends amazingly well into the grassy, floral flavors. The fruits, grapefruit, blood orange and kiwi get accompanied by big chunks of lime, settling among a bubbly, fitting carbonation. The sunny aspect gets provided by a glimpse of glazed, honeyed malts, which covers the tingling fruit acid beautifully. It not only gives the beer its balance but adds depths to the fruit appearance, supporting the versatile, bitter hops. While beginning crisp, floral, with unripe, dry fruits, the hops develop into a more tropical, resinous direction, completed by a honeyed, malty peak. Finishes with a slick dryness, developing from a rich, exuberant, smooth fruitiness. The sourness dries-out the tongue, while at the same time a honeyed fruitiness wraps up the palate. 1,281 charactersaleigator, Jan 03, 2015

Apricot honey colored with a two finger head of beige foam that lingers long. Bright and inviting aroma of citrus, pine, and mango.
Fresh and electrifying burst of hop flavors, full of tangerine, mango, pine, and grapefruit.  Big flavors upfront followed by a flourish of bitterness.  Assertive but not aggressive bitterness, just enough to keep it well balanced. Perfect mouthfeel, even and full, with a tingly finish. Great, great beer. 542 charactersfar333, Jan 01, 2015

Pours a bright, orange - yellow that is semi transparent with a slightly off white fluffy head that falls off to a thin ring that is somewhere in between fizzy and foamy. 
Aroma is citrusy, with sweet fruits, sweet malt, floral hops. 
The taste is impressive. Multiple fruit flavors. Almost reminds me of a handful of those "Runts" mixed fruit hard candies we used to eat as kids, except better. Sweet malt base. Subtle funky yeast and musty dankness, and an ever so slight slight medicinal green flavor. The hops are moderately bitter and floraly, but very well integrated with the rest of the flavors. No noticeable alcohol. 
The mouthfeel has a slight crispness/ spark to it that is hard to describe, but I don't belive it is from the carbonation. It is almost a peppery like rye. It is very, very creamy and full bodied without being too heavy. Oily slick finish. Outstanding. Best part about the beer for me. 
So incredibly balanced and smooth. Overall, it is easily one of the better DIPA s I have ever had. 1,069 charactersWesMantooth, Dec 28, 2014

Just an extraordinary beer. The beer is brilliant, The nose is just fantastic. It is so fresh and floral...so pronounced even after the beer has sat in the glass for a bit. The aromas just burst out of the glass. Probably wrong glass but I recommend snifter...seemed to work for me. It literally explodes with flavor. 
It brings me back to early PTE when it was so fresh and unknown. After so many left on the shelf or boxed and traveled  PTE's It's hard to remember. Definitely like very fresh PTE on tap in No Cal. Literally took me back to DIPA fest at The Bistro in Hayward.
As bottle finishes the beer in glass becomes more creamy and soft. Absolutely spot on, and so unlike most bottled beers.
This is a special beer. As good as it gets. 837 charactersBillRoth, Dec 27, 2014

L: Very lovely 3-finger off-white head sits on top of a golden brew. Hazy, but not totally opaque. There's some crazy looking lacing here.
S: Heaps of citrus, peach and tropical fruit are just flying out of the glass before I bring my nose in. Definitely one of the most aromatic beers out there. SoS is definitely dry-hopped with loads of Citra. Can't totally verbalize exactly what that aspect is, but I've been having a lot of single-hopped Citra beers lately, and this has all the hallmarks of those hops.
T: This is what an elite beer tastes like. Unbelievably complex. Peaches, mangos, oranges, papaya, and those delightfully sweet yeast esters that are undoubtably Conan or Conan-derived. Again, tons of Citra, especially evident on the finish. It's kind of sweet, but the body is thin enough that it's not overwhelming. To compare it to a more available beer: it's like a more refined Lagunitas Sucks.
F: Only slightly prickly on the tongue, this beer definitely falls into the camp of juicy IPA as opposed to a palate destroyer. Medium bodied, perfect for the flavors. I'm glad there's at least this gentle reminder that it's beer, otherwise I'd think I was drinking some sort of Newman's Own fruit juice. Can't score the mouthfeel any higher than 4.5 though because nothing can compete against Hill Farmstead, especially their Double Citra. But this is very good.
O: The first time I had this, I gave it 5s across the board without a written review. I had it again about a month later and it was clearly a subpar batch with muted flavors and aromas. Today we have again a fantastic example of quintessential Sip of Sunshine. Some beers are undeserving of their hype. This is not one of those beers. Befriend your local beer guy. Ply him with out-of-state rarities. Have him hold you some Sip. You won't regret it. ;) 1,854 charactersOnemoresolo, Dec 26, 2014

I hope this becomes more available in the following months because I think this might be one of my favorite IIPA's and would love to get more. 412 charactersWhiteHillsStore, Dec 23, 2014

A- pours a clear vibrant golden color with a small creamy and sudsy white head that eventually reduces to a film skimming the top, leaving some short lasting lace behind
S- loads of citrusy hop aroma up front with notes of mango, papaya, passionfruit, grapefruit & orange peel.  Also picking up some floral notes, along with some fresh grass.  Underlying doughy malt with a hint of garlic on the close
T- sharp bittering citrus hop flavors immediately kick in, quickly followed by more citrus flavor of mango, orange zest and passionfruit.  Mid palate consists of fresh grassy flavors with a hint of floral hop as well.  Leafy and earthy, mixed with just a hint of underlying bready malt, dry finish with more tropical hop on the linger
M- medium body with medium carbonation leads to a foamy mouthfeel that continues into a dry finish
O- the intense tropical hop notes are definitely as advertised, as they shine throughout.  Just enough underlying malt to let the hops shine, very good DIPA! 1,062 charactersTreyliff, Dec 23, 2014

Aroma:   Dank tropical fruits.
Taste:   Same as the nose.   Dank fruits, well-balanced hoppiness with a smooth finish.
Overall:  This beer is amazing and dangerously drinkable.    Dank tropical fruits right up front (almost reminds me of fruit stripes gum) with nice hoppiness.  Smooth!  Had it on tap at Three Penny Taproom in Montpelier, though I prefer to drink out of the can.  Def my favorite beer in the style.  Don't compare to Heady, enjoy them both!

The tropical arrangement and finish are better executed than Double Sunshine, which is another equally amazing DIPA. If you haven't had this yet and you require more specifics, see my review on the aforementioned DS. For my money, this one hits all the notes and then some. When it comes to the IPA game, Vermont has the master key.

Nose is on point, tropical hops with a bit of malt seeping through. That malt is interesting -- it almost makes me think there's a touch of wheat in there, as it has that trademark hint of dampness wheat can give off. Anyway, taste isn't earth shattering, tropical sweet maltiness, but the nose saves this one, as well as a nice feel. Nice stuff but nothing worth killing yourself to trade for. 522 charactersbreadwinner, Dec 17, 2014

4.31/5  rDev -5.5%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.25Beautiful golden pale ale; "sunshine" is a rather apt descriptor. Fairly clear with just a little haze, and topped by a beautiful snow white, light and fluffy head. Very good retention, and huge snowdrift chunks of lace.
Quite a bit in the aroma, but all balanced. The hops are there: juicy, floral, piney, slightly dank, and peppery. The malt is there: sweet and creamy.
Flavor matches. I don't get tons of specifically tropical hop flavors as promised by the description; rather, it's a blend of hop flavors, from dank to resinous to floral to tropical. Quite a noticeable malt backbone, as well, with a diacetyl-like tinge to the flavor.
Creamy yet somewhat lively mouthfeel; a really nice in-between of a slow DIPA sipper and a single IPA gulper. Lasting hop bitterness, with oily retention around an otherwise very slightly dry finish.
There's absolutely no indication this beer clocks in at 8% ABV! There's a heavy, sweet malt presence, but no alcohol presence whatsoever.
This is a tough beer to rate. Some things it does about perfectly (balance, appearance, mouthfeel). Others are very, very good (aroma, flavor) but perhaps not world-class. It's an excellent DIPA, thankfully available in cans. 1,209 charactersRoguer, Dec 16, 2014

4.63/5  rDev +1.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 22oz bottle (Bottled On Date: 11/13/14) into a 17oz Belgian snifter/tulip glass.
A- A decent amount of sediment at the bottom of the bottle caused me to be careful with the pour.* I was able to yield a slightly hazy (without floaties), beautiful, sunset orange/golden colored beer with a pleasant, 1-finger white, soapy head with great retention. (4.5)
S- A potpourri explodes from the glass: Pineapple, Passionfruit, Mango, Ruby Red Grapefruit, Pine along along with some herbal (almost 'catty') notes and a dose of sweet, biscuty malt. (4.5)
T- The biscuty malt sweetness is perceived, but is quickly railroaded by the tropical juicy goodness delivered from the hops. The hops linger on the palate with a dry, piney finish, leaving you reaching for the glass to grab another sip. (4.75)
M- In conjunction with the massive hop presence, a the lively carbonation helps to lighten the body giving this 8% ABV beer a high drinkability factor. (4.75)
O- Although another great offering from Lawson's Finest Liquids, the ~$10/bottle price tag seems a bit much when you consider other masterful DIPA's like Sixpoint's 'Resin' and 'Bootleg Fireworks' from Baxter Brewing Co. However, Sip Of Sunshine will give the best of Vermont's other DIPA stars a run for their money. (4.5)
* I don't like much sediment in my beer, as I find it clouds all aspects: appearance, aroma and flavor. Therefore I choose to decant as much as I can to deliver me the cleanest beer available (This time, even after employing a mini-snifter to capture the remainder of 'clean' beer, I still ended up losing ~2oz). 1,604 charactersthreeviews, Dec 16, 2014

Pours a murky deep burnt yellow-orange color with two inches of bright white head and moderate carbonation evident. Loads of tropical fruits, pineapples, citrus hops, oranges, fruity malts, light resin, grass, and earthy notes. Super hoppy, tons of juicy tropical fruits and awesome citrus/oranges; I loved it.
Medium body and low to moderate carbonation. Super smooth, no bitterness which is great.
Overall this is a fantastic beer; like a Doulbe Sunshine "light", although it is still super hoppy. Love how much tropical fruit there is and how there is no bitterness....could drink this all the time. Well worth checking out. 774 charactersmdfb79, Dec 15, 2014

Grapefruit and tangerine are the main flavors. Slight dankness towards the end. Very little alcohol presence. Finishes with more dank and tropical fruits. Lightly carbonated. Super easy to drink.

Appearance: Nice hazy golden to straw color. Just a slight bit of redness in there as well. Decent head retention on this one as well. Sticks around throughout the drinking of this one. 
Smell: Its a bit absent on aroma, very floral and fruity, but not as dank as some can be in this category. Kind of subtle. But I have had these fool me in the past.
Taste: Wow, this is where they get you. This is a very nicely balanced beer. Not too alcoholic in the flavor for an 8% beer either. Nice resinous hops in there. Citrus fruits, tropical fruits and some earthiness to balance it out. It is not a bit harsh. It is very smooth for a DIPA. I would say that it is in the same category and maybe edges out the Stone Enjoy By. I might have to try the newest iteration to compare them. 
Overall: I am so pleased I made this trade work out, because this is a damn fine beer and super happy I got to try it out! If you can find it seek it out! Well worth the high marks! 1,085 charactershumuloner22, Dec 05, 2014

A: Pours a hazy, light, brass tinged orange with lively and vibrant carbonation that creates a large, rocky, eggshell white head.
S: Tropical fruit explosion. Blood/orange, passionfruit, grapefruit, guava, and fresh pine sap intermingle to create one hell of a decadent hop aroma. Subtle notes of fresh baked sweetbreads and pie crust lurk underneath as well.
T: Freshly squeezed citrus juices. Pine resin leaps forward next to remind you that this a firmly American IPA. Typical northwest hop bitterness washes over your palate and stays there through the finish.
M: Medium to slightly high carbonation with a medium body.
O: I want smell this all day, too bad it's so tasty that it won't last that long. This is a tremendous DIPA and one that is worthy of all the praise and hype it gets, and that is something I don't say lightly.

A 1 pint 6 oz bottle of Sip of Sunshine was handed to me as I picked up two cases of Heady Topper.  I originally said no, but I looked back and saw that everyone else was taking one...so I did too.  I wasn't sure at first, but I'm so glad I changed my mind.  Delicious beer - hoppy, fruity, fresh (bottled 15 days before I picked it up), and smooth.  Is it better than Heady Topper?  A little more session-able in my opinion, but not better.  Not as good as Heady Topper?  Wouldn't say that either. 646 characterscanucklehead_NY, Nov 30, 2014

BOTTLED ON: 11-13-2014 (Consumed 11-23)
A:
Pours a hazy golden (with touches of amber in the light) with three gorgeous fingers of luscious pristine white cream.  Airy descent to a solid 1 finger.  Excellent retention; impressive, shifting lacing.  (4.5)
S:
Super fruity.  Juicy aromas of grapefruit, green pineapple, pine, weed, dank sappy hops.  (4.25)
T:
Resinous fruity hop layers.  Papaya, pine, tropical fruits, bready malt way down there.  (4.75)
M:
Coating, peach-fuzz-like feel with a medium body and lingering sticky dryness.  Quenches and unquenches with giving you a rich palate experience overall.  Excellent.  (4.75)
O:
This is definitely among the best IPAs I have ever had.
It is a good all-around package in my mind in that it manages to be very hoppy, very fruity, very bitter, very dry, very creamy, etc. all at seemingly the same time.
Beer pours gorgeous with a excellent head that stays and stays and rings and spots of lacing.  The smell is of pungent hops, the kind where you can feel it in your sinuses.  The flavor seems a lot stickier and more bitter than the aroma, but is also held down by an underlying round sweetness (bready papaya taste) that makes it rich as well instead of just sticky and bone dry.  
The overall effect is one of sweet/tart mouth puckering tropicalia that gives way to pungent hoppy resins and a velvet feel.
Must have again; worth jumping on if you can get your hands on some.  (4.75) 1,459 charactersTheDoctor, Nov 25, 2014

The highlight of this one is the heavy accent on tropical fruit. The aroma gives some indication but the flavor bursts with it. Like a huge dose of vitamin C. Not quite a DIPA for me, kind of in the middle between an IPA and DIPA. 271 characterspapat444, Nov 25, 2014

4.77/5  rDev +4.6%A - Pours a clear, bright dark gold color with a nice, thick, white bubbly lacing ring.
S - Resiny tropical fruit:  red juicy grapefruit, tangerine, mango, papaya, pineapple.  Dank and juicy with little to no malt aroma at all - it's all about the hop blend in this beer.
T - Follows the nose but more balanced on the palate.  Tropical fruit from start to finish without being cloying or sweet, just when the sweetness starts to surface the bitterness beats it down almost immediately without being overbearing and levels out at the end for a lingering sweet & fruity bitterness.  Peppery, spicy tropical fruit goodness: grapefruit rind, oranges, tangerines, mango, some pineapple skins and light to little booziness.
M - Medium body, gentle carbonation on the tongue that subsides to silky, and coats the entire mouth with a mixture of fruit resin and bitterness.
O - Despite the ratings, it really does live up to the score. 930 charactersjzeilinger, Nov 22, 2014

Light fizzy fluffy head, decent lacing, hazy amber shaded orange color. 
Nose is great, big fruit, tropical notes, papaya, musty passion fruit notes, little generic tropical, light citrus as well, mild citrus orange and tangerine. Faint sweet malt. 
Taste brings more tropical fruits, generic tropical blend, papaya, pineapple, little tangerine and nice orange citrus, juicy fruit and mild musty resin. Nice mild sweet malt base, juicy malt, nice balance with no booze. Finish is drier but pretty sweet, nice lingering tropical notes and citrus. Nice lingering bitterness. 
Mouth is med bod, soft, decent carb, booze hidden well. 
Overall good, not great, it's a well done dipa but there are def better out there. 893 charactersjlindros, Nov 19, 2014

A - Poured a hazy orange hue with a one finger white head that leaves light lacing and a nice thin blanket.
S - Aromas of oranges, light malt, faint caramel, very light tropical notes. Not bad, but, not the more aromatic of Lawson's Liquids.
T - Taste is much, much better than the nose. Oranges, faint malts, good light sweetness. Light mango/pineapple notes with loads of hops. Nice tropical notes with some good bitterness and grapefruit peel/pith.
M - Mouthfeel is creamy, lightly carbonated, alcohol hidden very well.
O - Overall, not a bad DIPA. Good tropical notes, alcohol hidden nicely. Pleasant.

A-Hazy golden-orange color with some neat visible carbonation. 1F white head, heavy lacing. 
S- Citrus and earthy hops. Lots of citrus, no sweets.
T- Grapefruit and more citrus flavor. Hearty malt.
M- Silky on the lip. Sips light but hold up. Juicy. Long hop flavor finish.
O- It's a hop bomb and that's ok. It avoids the sugary alcohol trap of many DIPAs. 388 charactersNiceTaps, Nov 18, 2014

Slightly hazy pale bordering on golden with a decent sized long lasting sticky leaving head. Huge tropical fruity aromas, mango and pineapple immediately jump to mind. Earthy pine dank resinous with enough sweet bread to keep some order to things. Rich full on tropical fruity resinous hop flavor with a moderate level of bitterness. Medium body and carbonation.

3.75/5  rDev -17.8%It's BA score of 100 is way overrated, and honestly doesn't even make my top 3 Imperial/Double IPA's.  Reminds me more of a India Pale Lager, as it is on the clear side with only a moderate amount of lacing. 207 charactersDrunkelstiltskin, Nov 06, 2014

The head on this delicious looking beer is white, dense, and very persistent.  It has been airing out and warming up for the last few minutes and the head is relentless.  The body appears golden/orange, and appears to have a great deal of substance.  
This smells like rich grapefruit/tropical fruit.  This definitely has a rich, bright floral aroma. 
The taste is World Class.  This is the best IPA I have had this year.  I would have to do a side by side to claim this is the best IPA I have ever had.  Layers and layers of flavor abound in this juicy IPA.  Hops/tropical fruit/grapefruit/Honey.  All balanced to create one of Lawson's Finest Liquids.  
The mouthfeel is world-class.  Dense carbonation that coats and flows over your tongue.
Overall - Phenomenal.  One of the top three IPAs I have ever had.

It pours an orangy-straw color, a little haze, nice head, a nice looking beer, but nothing unusual.  The smell is where it starts.  It is startlingly strong and delicious.  Big citrus hops, with a bit of dank, which is exactly how it tastes, but the finish reveals a fantastic tropical fruit flavor as well.  Mouthfeel is great; not magical like some of Hill Farmstead's beers, but great.  Overall, this is a shockingly good IPA, one of the best I've ever had.  I'm so impressed and so bummed that I may never find it again... 563 charactersdougfur, Oct 24, 2014

Pours a clear copper color with an enormous white head that fades slowly.  Lots of sticky lacing.
Aroma is citrus and tropical fruits.  Very juicy like tropical punch.Really complex and interesting.  I'm in love with this smell!
Flavor is bitter and dry up front that is quickly filled in with grapefruit and orange rind,mango and some pine.  .  Finish is bitter and long, as it should be.  Taste doesn't quite live up to the aroma, but the aroma was so over the top it would have been hard to match.
Feel is medium with a really dry finish.
Overall, this pretty much everything I look for in a DIPA. 669 charactersmr-jj, Oct 22, 2014

4.5/5  rDev -1.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.522oz bottle poured into a large snifter. Bottled on 9/18/14. Traveled in checked luggage with a friend.
Pours very clear golden with a small white head. Lots of slow carbonation. Smell is lovely, very juicy, very citrus and floral.
Taste is quite good. Mysteriously dry and sweet at the same time, more clear hop flower flavor. More citrus, a little subtle orange. 
Mouthfeel is dry and crisp and thirst inducing. Overall, all around excellent beer. 452 characterssnaotheus, Oct 17, 2014

Ontap reservoir vt
A- Slight hazy golden pour to a snifter. A head rises above one finger with a thick creamy consistency and good retention. A nice ring and islands remain and spots of lace are fixed to the glass with some sheets.
S- Juicy fruits shine in the aroma with no hinting of harshness or bitterness, smooth and fruity. Mangos with tangerine, apricots and citrus juice.
T- Citrus and bitterness open up but the smoothness remains with mango, tangerine complimented by grapefruit and bitter orange zest. Juiciness and tropical stone fruit rules here.
MF- Medium bodied and fairly creamy. Carbonation is high but pretty much on point. Finishes with a moderate bitterness.
The mouthfeel really enhances a juicy stone fruit hop profile. The carbonation isnt aggressive but really pushes those delicate flavors onto the taste buds. 916 characterscbutova, Oct 14, 2014

5/5  rDev +9.6%This was really great. On tap at Prohibition Pig.
My girlfriend thought it tasted like armpit lol. I loved it. Probably some columbus or summit hops that gave off an onion-garlicy hop flavor. I just got loads and loads of spicey tropical hops.
It tasted like its name, and went down very easy. Also had just enough residiual sugar to balance it out. 
Was a close to a pale straw color. Unfiltered. 
Very highly recommended. I like it better than Heady. 456 charactersBigCheese, Oct 07, 2014

4.75/5  rDev +4.2%22oz bomber bottled on 9/18/14. Poured in a snifter glass.
A - Golden hue with a slight haze.  Has a "sunny" shine to it. Hehe.
S -  Very floral with some tropical fruit.  Nice intensity.
T - Lots of nice, bitter floral/resiny /oily hop flavor up front with tropical fruit notes as well. The finish is clean and refreshing.  Almost like a crisp west-coast finish akin to Enjoy By, but a little more graceful.  No noticeable maltiness.
M - Very light for the style.  Incredibly drinkable.  You could drink a couple bombers of this.
O - Really great DIPA.  So flavorful and complex.  I love how much hoppy flavor it packs without inducing a bitter grimace.  Similar to Double Sunshine with the tropical fruit notes, but more oily/floral with a less smooth finish. Overall, a fantastic DIPA. 793 charactersHeadyTheElder, Oct 05, 2014

A - golden orange appearance...not "cloudy" like some of the other famous Vermont beers from Hill Farmstead and Alchemist. White head good lacing.  
S - Dank pungent tropical  piney oniony fruit bomb.  In your face abrasive smell which I love in my DIPAs. 
T - Follows the nose closely with the expection of bitterness.  Very bitter finish but this is not a bad thing.  This beer packs everything a hop lover would dream of and all of the flavors blend well together.  There are smoother DIPAs out there but very few that are better than this. 
M - strong carbonation, highly dank fruity bitter.  Tastes buds are under assault for minutes after sipping......in a good way.  
O - Reputation of Lawson's beers live up to the hype.  Even better on draft.  Whatever they are doing with hoppy ales  in VT it's working better than anywhere else. 888 charactersHopDeezy, Oct 03, 2014

4.5/5  rDev -1.3%A:   Pours with a light white frothy head that slowly settles down.  Lots of lacing.  Beer is a rich amber color with moderate haze.  I like a dirty beer.  
S:   Citrus hops, pine and malt.  Pleasant aroma.
T:  Malt was a bit more forward than the smell.  The lemony citrus cuts through the sweetness, very nicely balanced.  The overwhelming flavor is pine.  The pine flavor really lasts in the mouth as a nice dry and bitter finish.  The pine finish lasts and lasts.
M:   Medium bodied with fair carbonation. 
O:  A fine IPA.  Very flavorful for the style, but not a palate wrecker.  Very tasty 599 charactersimscotty, Oct 02, 2014

A- Pours a cloudy lighter copper/dark orange body with a two finger foamy white head that briefly resembles freshly steamed milk that's just about to get poured to make a cappuccino. Very thick, frothy head, very impressive. Rings of lacing keep the glass from looking too clean. [4.25]
S- Tropical fruit, mango, grapefruit, floral notes, even a bit of pine. This IPA has everything, including a nice caramel malt backbone. This is very pleasing to inhale, and you don't have to inhale much to feel the full force of the hop aromas. Phenomenal nose. [4.75]
F- Plenty of tropical fruit and grapefruit up front and throughout; there isn't as much of the floral notes from the nose however. Sweet caramel and pale malt backbone that is clean with no graininess to be found; perfectly balances the hop aromas. It's very similar to Focal Banger in a lot of ways. Overall the flavour profile is very hop-forward but with a perfect amount of pale malt to back it up. [4.5]
M- That Vermont water is really doing some magic. Substantial body, on the fuller side of medium in body, with a nice soft feel that combines very well with what seems to be dialed in carbonation to make for a smooth but powerful drinking experience. A bitter resinous pine-caramel combination finishes things out, yet leaves the palate dry with tons of lingering juicy grapefruit flavours. Phenomenal. [4.75]
O- I don't get how Lawson's can dial in their IPAs so well. This is easily up there with The Alchemist's Focal Banger in terms of the most juicy, drinkable IPAs. This packs a massive aromatic right cross, and follows up with a left hook full of fruity flavours on the palate. Great stuff, I have to wonder if there's any recipe similarities between this one and Double Sunshine. [4.75]

Revisited 10/18/16 with a can (kindly retrieved from VT by a co-worker) dated 9/30/16 into pint glass.  Pours a hazy gold with a thin off-white head.  Initial impression heavily favors citrus (orange, grapefruit, possibly mango) with a touch of sweetness.  These morph into slightly bitter grapefruit, then pine.  Mouthfeel is medium, as is carbonation.  Quite  refreshing.  Finish is somewhat bitter but not overwhelmingly so.  
I had a Heady (can) a couple of days ago, and I can't honestly say that SoS (canned) beats Heady (canned).  So therefore maybe SoS is better on tap.  Guess the only way to find out is to revisit The Reservoir! 843 charactersdbl_delta, Sep 22, 2014

4.79/5  rDev +5%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75L - Pours a very golden hazy orange. A good inch to inch and a half of bone white head forms. Very tight bubbles compose the head that dissipates rather quickly. After the dissipation a crown forms around the glass and leaves very nice lacing behind. It looks like a beer you want to drink.
S - The first aroma is of tropical fruits. Citrus of oranges, grapefruit, and slightly pineapple. The tail-end smells of the malt backbone but very subtle compared to the citrus scents up front.
T - Similar to the up front tropical notes of the smell. Citrus. Pine. Subtle hop bitterness at first, followed by a much stronger presence with bitterness on the high side. One of the most bitter beers I have had in a long long time. It definitely destroys the palate.
M - Mouthfeel is full bodied, surprisingly so. Slightly less carbonated mouthfeel than I would have expected for an Imperial, but this would not steer me away.
O - Overall this is an excellent beer. The first offering that I have had from Lawson's and I now understand the hype. If other offerings are of similar quality, they are all a home run. I would recommend anyone to pick this up at any opportunity they have, even if Imperials aren't there thing. It's definitely a tick worth ticking. 1,253 characterszoober911, Sep 21, 2014

4.2/5  rDev -7.9%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4On tap at Three Penny Tap Room.  I was very surprised to see a Lawson's beer for sale outside of Warren (and on draft, no less), but was confused when the bartender began describing the beer in almost apologetic tones.  He explained that it was brewed outside of Warren in a large facility, that old man Lawson oversees it as much as possible but, gull darn it, you can't really guarantee quality at a large facility the same as you can at his ridiculously small brew house.  
Still, the tender assured me, the beer was very good.  Just not as good as Double Sunshine.
And he was right.  It smells *nearly* as wonderful as Double Sunshine, with big nodes of tropical fruity hops dancing against herbs and spice. Really, really wonderful aroma.
But it doesn't taste as good.  It's solid for the style, definitely, but the back end is pretty thin.  Big, delicious, fruity hop rush up front, and then a much tamer and more citrusy finish.  Not bad by any means, but hardly world class. 985 charactersmynie, Sep 20, 2014

4.89/5  rDev +7.2%Pours cloudy gold color (darker gold for second pour of the bomber) with a lot of sediment floating in the brew, leading up to the 1-2 finger foamy white head that was full of bubbles and faded very slowly, leaving great thick foamy lacing coating the sides, rings as it went down and a layer on top. 
The nose is bursting with citrus, and I could smell the hops from 6 inches away. Aroma is a potent combo of grapefruit, orange, pineapple, fresh juicy wet citrus hops, mango, graham cracker, malt, floral hops, grass, caramel, pine cone/piney hops, spices like pepper and faint coriander, as well as earthy notes like dried hay or dried hops, and some lemon zest at the end. A lot of tropical/citrus fruit notes and a lot of fresh hop goodness make this excellent smelling with just enough malt balance to keep it very close to perfection. 
Tastes very similar to the aroma (thank goodness!) with a combo of grapefruit, orange, pineapple, fresh juicy wet citrus hops, lemon zest, mango, graham cracker, malt, floral hops, grass, caramel, pine cone/piney hops, toasted grains, pepper and other spices like tea leaf and faint coriander, either brown sugar or dry cake batter, earthy notes like dried hay, peat moss or dried hops, and a bready finish like a dry biscuit. The flavor was by no means dry, in fact it was extremely juicy and the hops were fresh and delicious with the malt backbone making this perfectly balanced and hiding the ABV completely. This brew is not sweet for long as the hops wash away any sweetness and then leave some bready/grainy after tastes swirling with the mild bitterness. The complexities are constantly changing the arrangement of the taste, which to me is a sign of great ingredients and a very well crafted beer. 
Mouthfeel is buttery and slick, with a medium almost chewy body, mild/below average carbonation and a slightly bitter finish that trails off with grainy notes, floral hop notes like tea leaf, and of course some citrus hops. It’s almost a dry finish with minimal sweetness and a great aftertaste that brings out more grapefruit/orange/pineapple/lemon with each sip. 
My first beer from Lawson’s and it lived up to the hype. This was a great DIPA, worth seeking out; hell, it’s worth the 10 hour drive to go up to Vermont to get some. A very high recommendation. 2,320 charactersCHickman, Sep 20, 2014

Smell is mango, papaya, pineapple, marijuana, and grapefruit. 
Taste follows huge hits of citrus and marijuana up front and grapefruit in fairly bitter finish.

A:  Poured into a snifter a bright orange color with a nice eggshell colored head.  Some haze, but thats fine for an IPA.  Nice looking beer!
S:  Huge bright hop aroma!  Lots of tropical fruit from  the Citra hops.  Big hints of mango, stone fruit, and citrus.
T:  Follows the nose.  Assertive bitterness, but in a pleasing way.  Tons of mango and citrus flavor.  Some nice malt sweetness on the back end.
M:  Medium carbonation and body.  Nice and smooth.  Easy drinking.
O:  IPA's don't get much better.  Right up there with the Top tier DIPAs in my opinion.  This makes me really want to try Double Sunshine, because if its better than this, I'll be blown away! 696 charactersBrams17, Sep 12, 2014

5/5  rDev +9.6%From notes
On tap at Prohibition Pig in Waterbury VT
Appearance: It has a nice hazy deep golden/orange color to it. It has a nice thick off-white head that dies down moderately and leaves nice lacing.
Smell: Speechless. The aromas give out hints of loads of tropical fruit (citrus, grapefruit and mango), loads of dank pine resins, and some light buiscuity/caramelly malts. 
Taste: Like the aromas, it has a ton of tropical notes of citrus, grapefruit, mango, even papaya, followed by a great dank piney bitterness and some buiscuity/caramelly malts in the back. 
Mouthfeel: It has a low-med carbonation with a very nice overall balance and feel. 
Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied by great flavors and aromas. This beer is so fresh, pungent and dank. This is my first time giving a 5/5 rating but this beer definitely deserves it. The aromatics in this DIPA and that raw in your face bitterness is like none I've ever had. Amazing!

Appearance: Light and golden orangish body.  Bubbly white head that sticks around for a while before dissipating.
Smell: Amazing!  Mix of piney and sweet (possibly fruity).
Taste: Subtly sweet paired with a very pleasing blend of piney and fruity hops.  The pine taste mixes well with the citrus and topical tastes for a blend that is just too damn good.
Mouth Feel: Light to medium body with a lot of happy little carbonation bubbles.
Overall: This one was delicious and brought a smile to my face.  Tastes like a happy day and very appropriately named.  Reputation on this one is well earned. 707 charactersEricness, Sep 07, 2014

Lots of bitterness on the tongue, great hop flavor with herbal spiciness. Medium bodied with effervescent carbonation.

4.75/5  rDev +4.2%The beer comes in a deep rich reddish amber.
The aroma is sweet pungent fruit of pineapple, orange nectar, dank, spicy pine.
The flavor has sweet fruits in the front of mangoes, grapefruit, orange, then the beer moves onto aggressive amounts of piney spicy resinous hops. The sweetness in the front and then it cleans off and becomes dangerously drinkable and bitter on the end.
This reminds me a lot of Gandhi Bot and Sucks, maybe Enjoy By and Double Jack. This on the other hand does not remind me of the VT Hoppy beers. 525 charactersdar482, Aug 26, 2014

4.5/5  rDev -1.3%I've been meaning to score some Lawsons for quite a while. Bottled 8/15/14.
Pours a bright golden hue with a one-finger head into my glass.
Grapefruit and mango burst in the nose with just a touch of bready malt character underneath.
A mouth-puckering dose of grapefruit and mango greets my taste buds. Whoa! It's followed up by a strong malt base. 
My mouth is coated with lingering citrus notes and bready malt. I kept forgetting that this is 8%, chugging it a bit due to thirst.
I liked Double Sunshine more. This is similar to Heady Topper but with a much tamer hop bite. 582 charactersBrad007, Aug 25, 2014

Type:  22oz. Bottle
Glass:  Lawson's Tulip
Bottled:  08/15/14 - uber fresh
Pours a hazy golden in color w/ ever so slight ruby hues, w/ a 1/4 finger white head that leaves light sticky lacing on the glass.  The nose was of peach, mango, clementine, and white grapes over mild pine and floral.  The taste was big tropical and citrus fruit up front, transitioning to grapefruit, and finishing w/ mild herbal bitterness.  Chewy and lush as only Lawson's can do w/ middle of the road levels of carbonation.  This IPA is deceptively drinkable/sessionable even at 8.0% ABV.
Overall, awesome IPA from Lawson's that is on the cusp of being a DIPA, but either way it is a fantastic experience. 702 charactersmikeyv35, Aug 23, 2014

Pours with a nice foam head and is a beautiful orange/yellow in color.
Taste is smooth, citrus notes with a bit of a bite on the end, but no lingering aftertaste. Not a lot of nose to this offering, but plenty of flavor.
This is a must for lovers of hops and citrus. 313 charactersRideguy64, Aug 22, 2014

Pours a golden hazy yellow, with some darker orange tinges, and a one inch head, with sticky lacing down the glass.
Smells potent, and bright, like the sunshine in the name. Orange, pineapple, grapefruit pith, pine resin.
This one tastes great. It's of course no Double Sunshine, but it's a good facsimile. The malt comes through as a pleasant honey-ish flavor, with tons of juicy fruit flavors- orange, grapefruit, pineapple, lemon, with some grassiness as well, along with some mild piney bitterness. The bitterness is understated and low, letting the bright juicy hop flavors shine brightly.
This one has a medium body, with a light airy and crisp mouthfeel, with a slight, mild lingering bitterness on the palate. Very, very drinkable.
This was great, absolutely delicious. 814 charactersGreesyFizeek, Aug 21, 2014

The second time was on draft at the Worthy Kitchen in Woodstock Vermont just a few days ago. This is a truly great brew; right up there with its sister Lawson's Double Sunshine. Served in a sniffer. Very smooth, nice clean taste, plenty of hoppy nose, right amount of head and lacing. I think because it was a draft I enjoyed it even more. Highly recommended. 454 charactersricknelson, Aug 18, 2014

The feel of the beer is very drinkable for 8%. Overall it's a really great beer, I drink it whenever I have it on hand. 379 charactersKnapp85, Aug 15, 2014

I like this because of the hop complexion, which is citrusy and clean but quite big, but I like it more for the mouthfeel, which is softly but happily carbonated, and pillowy, light in body really, but overall a full mouth experience. I know this isn't double sunshine, and I seem unable to track that down right now, but I am awful happy to have this big ipa in its place. a real gem from a Vermont legend. the others will have to wait, but stoked to have a sip of sunshine... 1,171 charactersStonedTrippin, Aug 14, 2014

Appearance: Free pour yields a big frothy white head that dissipates slowly. Semi-translucent orange, sparse lacing. 
Smell: Amazing. Tons of tropical fruit aroma, underpinned by pungent marijuana and pepper. I can't capture in words how much is going on here, and it's all excellent. Gets more citrusy with time (tangerine, grapefruit), remaining full of tropical fruit with those same expectation-expanding undertones. 
Easy 5.0. It was a 5.0 when I first put it in the glass, and it's getting better every second. 
Taste: At first it's a punch in the face of dryness and bitterness, with an oniony garlicky hop finish (Summit?). There's still some tropical fruit as well, but at first it's in the background. It doesn't take long to fill up with tangerine and grapefruit. 
The flavor is basically 75% of the aroma, plus a really noticeable mouthfeel. The bitterness, dryness, and hard water scream through every sip. Could be polarizing, but I love it (and the current rating average suggests that it's not so polarizing anyway).
Mouthfeel: Light side of medium bodied, high carbonation, powerfully dry. Puckeringly succulent and grapefruit like at times. Juicy, mineraly, sometimes almost creamy. 
Overall: Great stuff. I often say that Lawson is the cream of the Vermont crop (and that Double Sunshine is the best (D)IPA in America), and this beer doesn't change my impression. Interesting mouthfeel, unbelievable aroma, great flavor. 1,566 charactersPahn, Aug 08, 2014
4.65/5  rDev +2%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from bottle into a tulip glass, enjoyed for IPA day. Bottled on july 17th so this is 3 weeks old. Beer is a bright amber gold, really impressive film and lacing on this, a little cloudy.
S - Sucks you in with deep piney, and white grapefruit notes, lemons and limes mixed with some tropical passionfruit and mandarin hints, so crisp and also deeply inciting. Grapefruit notes with an intoxicating floral character abound. A vertical nosing highlights the range of light florals, meaty citrus and heavier phenolic resins that meld together.
T - Start is rich with an upfront mandarin orange and grapefruit citrus flavour before it shifts to cover more of a spicy and resiny side. A big feel to it as layers of hoppy bitterness unleash in waves, carrying bitter citrus, and balanced piney resins, There is a hint of crystal sweetness in the malt profile perhaps but it stands up to the heavy hopping really well. It almost melds as gooseberry notes come toward the finish. Lovely beer. As it warms additional levels of complexity emerge, strong florals and bitter hops cascade but are such a symphony of flavour it ties together on the finish really well. Some slickness on the finish. Hop oils amid a delicious flavour profile.
M - big beer to be sure, although it drinks really nicely you definitely get a notice of its strength and it commands your attention as you drink it. Finish is lingering and bitter. Moderate carbonation, not enough to get in the way of things but even enough to make a really balanced heavy IPA slide along really well.
Were I to compare, I would say this was reminiscent of Heady Topper but with a more unrestrained and assertive bitterness. Hopheads will love this as I did, a really well put together and full bodied IPA, drinks fantastically but the bitterness is so lovely, balanced with a well put together malt body. Really inspiring stuff. Near perfect for an assertive well-hopped IPA. Grows on you and show additional levels of depth and just so tasty. 2,000 charactersmick303, Aug 08, 2014

A - Pours a softened orange with a 2 finger white head. Nice lacing and good retention. White head, hazy and loaded with sediment.
S - Mango, grapefruit, white grapes, lemons, and just a cocktail of other citrusy fruit. The smell is excellent. 
T - Just an explosion of citrus. Mango and grapefruit up front. It finishes with a little bit of pine that I did not smell coming and some soft dry malt to balance it out. 
M - Medium bodied, finishes dry, bitterness lingers. Perfect by my palate. 
O - This is my first Lawson's experience and I am thoroughly impressed. This is easily a top 5 beer for me if not higher. The citrus cocktail that was this beer is spectacular. Love it. 743 charactersPSU_Mike, Aug 08, 2014

The beer pours a lightly hazy, golden straw color, many bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass with a thick, soapy, white head that sits about 2 fingers high that has decent retention and leaves some spotted lace behind. The aroma is lovely, plenty of citrus, tropical fruits, juicy, fresh and crisp, with some wildflower, delicate and soft with light pine and grassiness with just enough pale malt sweetness to balance the beer well. The brightness hides the bitterness so well and the delicate nature of the aromas is just what I like. The flavors are right in line, lovely pineapple fruit, mango, grapefruit, lemon, delicate wildflower, a touch of bitter pine cuts down the citrusy and fruity flavors, but doesn't overtake the flavors at all and there is just a hint of sweet pale grain at the finish that plays very well with the fruit flavors. The mouthfeel feels a bit lively, more carbonation and prickliness than expected but it coats the tongue very well and has a nice dry finish.
Verdict: A damn fine DIPA from Sean and a natural extension of Double Sunshine. He is really close to replicating his master creation on a larger scale. The higher carbonation really seems to be the only thing that seems that different which is hardly a big gripe from me. Just a joy to drink, like it's predecessor. 1,440 characterskevanb, Aug 07, 2014

This is a beautiful beer - slightly hazy yellow-orange with a finger of slowly dissipating tight white head. It radiates in the sunshine.
The aroma is amazing - lots of citrus and tropical fruit followed by a bit of spice, resin and dank and just a hint of caramel or butterscotch. 
Taste is also amazing - how do they do this? It starts off sweet and fruity, followed by herbaceous and floral, then ends with a healthy dose of bitterness. A multi-layered experience in a glass.
Mouthfeel is just perfect. Creamy, full and smooth while still refreshing and zingy.
Overall this is just a fabulous beer. I heard it's a bit pricey, but I can't say since I didn't buy it. But I'd have to say the price point would have to be pretty high to exceed its worth. This is damn good! 861 charactersFFreak, Aug 01, 2014
4.15/5  rDev -9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4On tap at Prohibition Pig. Served in a snifter.
Appearance - Hazy orange body. Nice big white head. Never quite dissipates. Nice lacing inside the glass.
Smell - Lots of citrus. Orange. Has a grassy component too. A little bit of pale malt sweetnness.
Taste - The hops are grassier here. Grapefruit and orange hops lend a juicy hop flavor up front and it gets more grassy as it gets more bitter. The malts are a little toasty and the finish is a long grassy bitterness.
Mouthfeel - Medium body. Well carbonated. Strong bitterness.
Overall - Very tasty. It has a bit of a buttery malt flavor, but it only comes out as it warms. Drink quickly! 646 charactersAlieniloquium, Aug 01, 2014

This week I had it on draft for the second time.   TOTALLY different experience, in a good way.   More floral, fruity, sweeter (not too much).  I sometimes fear this beer is overhyped, but I love to buy the tall boys and I will absolutely choose it on draft again over almost (I'll say it again, almost) anything that is normally on draft. 482 characterswoodchipper, Jul 27, 2014

S-Moderate-to-intense tropical hop aromas. A very Lawson-esque aroma. Floral and tropical. A bit of graininess.
T-The flavor is tasty but I'd like to get a little more 'pop' here. It just needs to be turned up another clicks on the dial. Tropical fruit medley that sort of just tastes fruity rather than specific fruits. Floral as well. Light bready and pale maltiness with some cooked grain flavor.
M-Surpriningly light for 8%. Almost thin. Moderate bitterness. Moderate carbonation as well.
O-A tasty treat for sure but I do find a few mostly minor gripes. Would gladly drink it again though. 693 charactersVelvetExtract, Jul 21, 2014

It's solid but not nearly on the top tier of New England IPAs in my opinion. It looks like a typical filtered West Coast IPA. There's a nice dank flavor and the ABV is well hidden but there's not much nose and it's a bit on the bitter side for a Vermont heavy hitter. 331 charactersSenatorSpaceman, Jul 13, 2014

A - Rich golden orange body; not hazy at all. The head was off white, foamy, and quick to dissipate.
S - A divine mix of fruity tangerine, ripe melon, and sappy pine. Just a hint of wildflower honey.
T - A grand slam of hop flavors immediately overwhelms the palate. Just like the nose, except even more intense, and with a tad more grapefruit citrus mixed in with the tangerine. The malt is sweet but not cloying, with the taste of Belgian cookies coming to mind. The finish is not at all bitter, and trails off into a land of hop bliss aftertaste.
M - Velvety with moderate carbonation. For the sweetness, not too viscous. 
O - Damn near perfect. We had Heady Topper and Abner at the table and this was the hands down favorite. I love that it perfectly blends citrus, tropical, pine, and floral hop flavors. I had heard great things about this brewery and, wow, did this brew deliver. 952 charactersporter_collie, Jul 08, 2014

Served in a HF wine glass. Golden-yellow pour, hazy, with a foamy white head that sank to a collar, and laced the glass nicely. In the nose, citrus and tropical fruits, background crackery malts. Much like Double Sunshine, all things good. Taste was crisp and leafy, pine needles, citrus rind, underripe pineapple, biscuity pale malts, and a touch of neutral alcohol; dry grassy finish. Light-medium body, crisp hoppy mouthfeel, a nice beer overall, and yet another successful IPA from Lawson's. I need to try this again, and hopefully side by side with a DS for comparison. 596 charactersRifugium, Jun 05, 2014

4.5/5  rDev -1.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5There are a good amount of opinions and some dissention by a number of loyal Lawson's Finest Liquids devotees regarding SIP OF SUNSHINE IIPA. For starters, this beer, while Sean Lawson's recipe, is produced at and by Two Roads brewery in CT, so when someone like myself looks at a tap list of a well respected tap room (that shall remain nameless) and notices that the "origin" of the beer is listed as "Vermont," and a 12 oz. pour is $8 (same price as Double Sunshine), there is a feeling of deception (in defense of Lawson's, another more reputable tap house mentions the origin of brewing as CT). Bottom line, it feels deceiving buying a "Lawson's" beer that isn't hand crafted by Sean Lawson himself.
Sip Of Sunshine is what Lawson's draft accounts are getting a steady supply of, which enables Lawson's to produce more bottles for market events and retail for select store locations (which are in demand at insanity levels). I cannot for one second blame Sean Lawson for cashing in on his strong reputation in the brewing industry, and truth be told most that get to try Sip of Sunshine have no idea where it is brewed or by who, but there is a bit of disconnect for his local fans. It should be noted that this is the second batch of Sip, considered by locals as "2.0" (I did not get to try "1.0").Enough said about the politics of Sip of Sunshine, and on to the review.
Hoppy Vermont IIPAs are traditionally cloudy and opaque: when Sip arrived on my table, the first thing I noticed was the lack of delightful unfiltered cloudiness I have come to appreciate so much. Sip looks more like a Ballast Point Sculpin IPA that has been through a centrifuge than it does a Lawson's IIPA . Minimal head and average lacing.
Nose was definitely hop forward as one would expect, but the word SUNSHINE inevitably invites the comparison to Lawson's Double Sunshine, which it takes a back seat to for my tastes. Notes of mango and pineapple are enjoyable.
Flavor is where SOS delivers the goods: this is a fine tasting IIPA by all respects, regardless of who or where it was brewed. The Mango and pineapple jump out, and prove this to be a very bright and bouncy palate pleaser. Moderate amount of residual bitterness,finishes relatively dry and crisp. ABV quite well hidden amongst the tropical fruit blast to the palate.
Mouthfeel is pleasant, if not a tad thin for a Lawson's IIPA, but it works. 
All politics aside, SOS is a genuinely enjoyable IIPA that Sean Lawson plans to continue tweaking and eventually put in cans. I suspect that the Lawson's name alone will command no less than a $15 price tag for four 16 oz. cans, but I would consider it another welcome choice in the cooler providing it lasts more than a few hours there like the LFL bombers.
**************UPDATE 12/25/14******************************************
Sip has arrived in cans, recipe tweaked,and price point @ $13.99 for a 4 pack of 16 oz. cans is a home run. Regardless where this is brewed,CT or VT, Sip is solid offering that has earned my respect. Highly recommended 3,047 charactersHendry, Jun 02, 2014

Bright orange with a thin wispy head. Intensely pungent SoS reeks of tangerine and oranges. Tastes as hoppy as it smells, predominately orange and tangerine with a gentle, lasting bitterness and piney edges. Blooms on my palette rather than explodes. At 8% it’s go some umph but not enough to turn me off to everything else. 
Jam bands and hops,that's what Vermont does best. 403 charactersdonkeyrunner, Jun 01, 2014

 The color is sunny like the name with golden and ambe hues with thick white head with visible carbonation in the body with fine bead and lace that sticks. The smell has a lot of orange peel scent with grapefruit juiciness and light dank herbal hop odors with slgiht grassy peppery note and mild alcohol. The feel is intense with hops and herbal resinous quality with moderately high carbonation making it feel light with dry strong lingering bitterness and gentle sweetness-very nice.
 The flavor is pure hop goodness with lots of tangerine and grapefruity match by some pithy citrus and mild pine tinges which bring back more orange zest spiciness in repeated tastes. The flavor has some grassy bitter aspects toward the finish with dry herbal quality and some mild alcohol as it warms. Overall this is an excellent double IPA, lots of intensity and very bitter but does not cross over into punishing or excessive -very drinkable for 8% 1,001 charactersSlatetank, May 29, 2014

We had the rare opportunity to get a pour from the bottom of one keg, and from the top of next. A slightly cloudy honey look in the glass, and I could smell the fruit while the glass waited on the table for the ladies to get their wine. Grapefruit and citrus, orange or tangerine were repeated with the first sip. Big and long bitterness. The pour from the new keg had more grain notes which better balanced the bitterness. The alcohol of 8% was we'll masked. Overall a great beer which I would gladly sample again. 569 characterstheIPAman, May 25, 2014

Beautiful hazy tangerine color with half a finger of head.
Smells amazing, nectarine, stickiness, mango, big tropical fruit.
Taste is even more intense. More flavor of nectarine and big tropical fruit.
Mouthfeel was good.
Overall, an incredibly delicious beer with a touch of nectarine. 332 charactersBoldRulerVT, May 06, 2014

Look - Rests a hazy caramel amber with a good sized soapy head that retains well. Tons of lacing.
Smell - Juicy grapefruit citrus, some malt back behind. Amazing aroma, so so juicy, perfect nose. 
Taste - Creamy malt is pushed out by momentary juicy citrus and then a blast of pine. Finishes pine.
Mouthfeel - Medium bodied with low carbonation. Rests piney and bitter. Not overly boozy. Good drinkability.
Overall - Another great brew from Sean Lawson. Pine hops are admittedly my least favorite variety nowadays but this brew is still masterfully crafted. Cheers! 643 charactersJMScowcroft, Apr 25, 2014

a: Dark gold with an inch tall white head which receded to thin surface foam and patchy lacing.
s: Mild pine,.
t: Piney hops forward over a medium malt base.
m: Medium, good body.
o: A very good IPA, darker than Double Sunshine in color and more pine rather than citrus in flavor. Makes me wonder if I was served the right beer, since others report a DS clone. Mine was not even close.
UPDATE: LAWSONS SIP OF SUNSHINE 4/9/17
Like Lawson's Super Session #2, I have had this a few years ago after it first came out, on draft in a bar/restaurant in Waterbury.  First time out in cans in my state.  Big fan of Double Sunshine and Peril, which are seldom made since Sean Lawson's father died.
Canned 3/21/17, so about three weeks old.
Poured from the 16 oz. can into a Lawson's stemmed tulip.
a: Translucent orange with a finger thick white head which receded to thin surface foam and fairly dense lacing.
s: Intense dank pine resin and citrus.
t: Follows the nose with moderate hop bite over a medium bready malt base.  Dry finish.
m; Medium to full, great body and good carbonation tingle.
o:  Better than I remember and now seems reminiscent of Double Sunshine.  Superlative flavor and Very good to exceptional in all other ways.  Worth seeking out, although at $5+ a can rather pricey, especially given newer competition locally which is about as good.  Changing my ratings: Look from 4.25 to 4, smell from 3.75 to 4.25, taste and overall from 4 to 4.25, feel from 3.75 to 4.5 1,567 charactersscotorum, Apr 21, 2014

Supposed to be similar to Double Sunshine and destined for regular appearances across VT. Should be good.
I'd do a specific review here but, honestly, this has everything that makes DS great. Tropical, citrusy hop character, and perfect balance make this amazing. Absolutely amazing and if, as Lawson's blog suggests, this is destined for cans, the Alchemist should be trembling in its boots.
