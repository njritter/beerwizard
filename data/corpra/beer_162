4.33/5  rDev -3.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Thanks to HighLowJack for sending this one! Reviewed from (long-standing) notes. Poured from a 16 oz. can into an El Catador Barrel-Aged glass.
A: Pours a turbid orangish gold. Forms a half-finger of white head with good retention but fairly low visible carbonation.
S: Juicy citrus, mango, and tropical fruits - pineapple and guava especially. Lesser notes of dank and melon, light biscuit malts, and a mild wheat base with minimal (if any) grist character. This is juicy – like mango/papaya/orange juice. A really nice aroma; not humongous, but SO fruit-juicy.
T: Follows the nose. Tropical fruit cocktail, orange or tangelo juice. There's some melon, mild spicy, and dank flavors. Biscuit and wheat malts – again, it's a sweetness without husky or grainy character. Fruit juice and melon with a modest bitterness in the hang.
M: Medium body, low alcohol. Average to a bit low carbonation sensation.
O: This was very good. Unfortunately, I don't know (yet) what the base beer tastes like...but this is really tasty. Very juicy and natural, and a noticeable malt body but that doesn't add much sweetness at all. Excellent. 1,132 charactersmacrosmatic, May 18, 2017

A: The beer is a very cloudy light gold color, with a short off-white head that fades quickly and leaves a thin lace on the glass.
S: The aroma contains very fruity citrus (tangerine & orange), floral and dank hops and caramelized malts.
T: The taste starts out sweet with strong fruity flavors of tangerine, orange and other citrus fruits. Then a strong floral hops bitterness quickly follows. The malt character is hearty but not too heavy and brings a very good balance. The after-taste is hoppy and slightly sweet.
M: Crisp and very smooth, medium body, medium carbonation, finish is slightly sticky.
O: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not too filling, good kick, very good representation of style, this is an excellent IPA to drink for a long time. 858 charactersTheManiacalOne, May 18, 2017

My palate has come a long way (and racked up many a hop-beating) since, but my impression still stacks up: ultra hopped, super tropical, pungent but so soft and smooth throughout. I'm not a fan of the turbid OJ pour and this is the archetype of the style. From there it's all tropical fruit - guava, passion orange, papaya, pineapple - ovrlayed on a malt base that holds up quite well. Barely any bitterness; completely unbalanced. 517 charactersManapuaMan, May 09, 2017

3.88/5  rDev -13.2%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.75A pounder can into a tumbler appears slightly darker than what a watered down version of jello vanilla pudding would look like if you poured it into a glass. It boasts a white cap that fades quick leaving a full curtain of lace.
The aroma is citrus fruits almost minty with pulpy and pithy fruit accent like oranges/grapefruit. It smells delicious.
The taste carries a lot of that minty hop feel with a hint of pine resinous cling lasting long into the aftertaste.
This is medium in body with modest carbonation. Its decent but possibly a dated can because it lacks any real hop punch to the nose especially for being double dry hopped. 639 charactersstakem, Apr 14, 2017

Canned On: 03/08/17
Pours a very nice hazy/cloudy golden yellowish color, very nice carbonation, with a very nice thick/creamy/foamy two-finger plus white head, which leaves some pretty nice sticky lacing behind. The nose is hoppy, slight malt, citrusy, grapefruit, lime. The taste is really nice, hoppy, slightly malty, with some really nice citrus, grapefruit, lime. Medium body, ABV hidden very well, a complex brew, with a nice dry/bitter finish. Overall, this is another really awesome brew from Trillium. Thanks Larry! 580 charactersWasatch, Apr 07, 2017

S: Big nose jumps out of the glass - tropical fruity pineapple, citrus peel, lime juice and an earthiness that at times reminds me of green onions.
T: Juicy. Bitterness coats the roof of the mouth after each sip.  Lime juice and pineapples and grapefruit juice are all noted, as is a more tannic, woodsy bitterness. 
M: This one is so juicy that it's nearly pulpy. Hard to measure its heft - call it medium to full in body, carbonation is not really noted, but it's there as a fine prickly type of carbonation. 
O: Very good. I feel the hops profile could be better, or better suited to my palate, but YMMV. 725 charactersKendo, Mar 28, 2017

4.61/5  rDev +3.1%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Pours a rich, golden hue of orange with an opaque transparency. Head foams up to two fingers in height and white in color,  and retains well with a few dashes of lacing left behind. Aroma is orange and citrusy, floral and earthy, and dank. Lots of hop qualities that all perform well, and avoid the citrus dripping aromas of similar beers. Flavor profile is citrus, floral, earthy, and dank. Orange juice notes intertwine to develop an interesting flavor profile. Interesting in the sense that it's in-ordinary, and yet is flavored extremely well with a balance that leans more on the sugary side of the sweet vs. bitter. Mouth feel is medium-thick with a smooth texture that only has a fine amount of fizz to it. Overall, this beer drinks resoundingly smooth, with an interesting hop profile. The variation from the typical hop notes spewed by beers of this style, paired with the smooth feel makes this one incredible "North East" IPA.

L - Pours a super hazy golden straw color, reminiscent of a mimosa. Little to no head on a mildly aggressive pour, delicate lacing that seems to fade off.
S - Mango, peach and bready malt up front. Slight lime/citrus makes its presence known but isn't a front runner. 
T - Grapefruit, citrus zest, a hint of pine that I didn't catch in the nose, faint spice and a solid malt backbone. A little lingering bitterness / pine as you finish the pint.
F - Medium bodied, lightly carbonated.
O - Certainly close to the epitome of a NE IPA, not quite a juice bomb but seriously in the upper echelon of all IPAs... The only complaint I have about this beer is the price. I get it, you're Trillium, but the premiumization on the price of this beer is insane. I couldn't even get a full mixed case for less than $100. I've had equal or better brews for less money from other MA brewers. 969 charactersMonkey-D-Luffy, Mar 13, 2017

Bright orange, hazy color. Thin layer of foam, some lacing. Smells like orange, light grapefruit, and some bitter pine. Tastes even better, bursting with citrus flavors like lemon, passionfruit, grapefruit, and pine. Firm but not assertive bitterness throughout. Really nice, full mouthfeel. Top notch IPA. 427 charactersgrover37, Mar 07, 2017

Appear: nice beautiful golden haze a richer darker gold then some of the other street series brews.  small amount off white foam.  
Nose: citrus zest def smell the lime zest mentioned in the description. doughy sweetness from the malts peach and mango fruit notes as well.  
Taste:  follows the nose there is a very distinct woodsy piney bitter note that follows from the lime, grpaefruit juciy notes you get. I like it.  Lime zest definitely the biggest note.  Really digging the El Dorado. 
Feel: silky smooth but a little thin.  
OVer:  My favorite of the 3 different street series I got in a recent trade.  I like the lime zest and citrusy sweet notes that then bounce off a woodsy piney notes.  Really nice 782 charactersGumbo_gravy, Feb 09, 2017

4.5/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured into a Sierra Nevada Spiegelau glass.  Bottom of can says 01/17/17.
A- Pours a turbid medium amber color with a full inch of off-white head that retains well before becoming a thick ring around the edge of the glass and a mostly full sheet of sheer surface foam.  Resilient lacing leaves a thick solid ring behind.
S- Smells like Froot Loops with a bit of dank green quality in the back.
T- Tangy stone fruit from the hops and a bit of sweet malt presence to balance.  Low bitterness and dangerously drinkable for the ABV.
M- Nice and soft but also crisp.  Medium carbonation and a body leaning toward the lighter side.
O- Another fantastic IPA from these guys.  I feel like it's only slightly more impressive than the regular but that's still saying something given how tasty the regular is. 804 charactersImmortale25, Feb 01, 2017

3.63/5  rDev -18.8%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.7516oz can, purchased from the brewery, poured into a Trillium Congress Street becher glass. Enjoyed on 12.30.2016, reviewed from Tasting Journal.
The beer pours a turbid and hazy orange color, copper hues with a foamy and soapy white head, good retention and lace. The aroma is decent, juicy peach and mango, citrusy, but strong bitterness, very green and earthy, raw leafy hop with some lime acidity and plenty of sweet grain. The flavors are decent, really green and earthy, leafy hop, definitely overhopped, super bitter, lots of lime forward citrus with some grapefruit peel and a bit of peach character. Sweet grains, pale and soft with some NE yeast character and a bit of tropical fruit grows as the beer warms to room temperature. The mouthfeel is good, coating and thick medium body, super smooth and creamy texture with soft finish that leaves a bit of dryness behind. 
Verdict: A decent IPA from Trillium, but definitely overhopped and aggressively bitter. Unbalanced in that regard and very harsh and punishing. Columbus is definitely an aggressive hop and the El Dorado doesn't do much to tame it in any way. 1,122 characterskevanb, Jan 23, 2017
4.5/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Look-Color is an opaque, Murky Tan with an orange tint to it. Pours two inches of white, frothy head that retains beautifully.
Smell-Oranges, hints of guava and mango, slightly grassy in the finish.
Taste-Flavor Notes are identical to the aroma.
Feel-Body is fairly light, very carbonated.
Overall-The light, fizzy texture along with the bold, fruity notes makes for a very satisfying yet  oddly refreshing beer. Very tasty. 428 charactersSteveB24, Jan 22, 2017
4.74/5  rDev +6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.7516 oz can dated 12/2/16 (so 6 weeks old or so)  Poured into a pint glass as an opaque, orange juice color.  Head barely topped half an inch and dissipated rather quickly.  That's a knock for me.  Nice clumps of lacing on the glass though.
The aroma is juicy with strong notes of orange and grapefruit and pine and smacks the nose just before you sip.  Orange notes permeate the up-front flavor but then give way to hints of lime, grapefruit and resinous pine.  Mouth feel is soft, almost creamy which I find very desirable.  Malt take a back seat to the hops while the bitterness kicks in slowly, moderately strong.  The sweet fruit tones linger even up to the end interplaying with the bitterness very nicely. That IMO is what makes this beer (and other similar trillium offerings) so successful.  So many NE IPAs start off strong with the tropical notes but then fade rather quickly into standard fare.  With this beer the juicy hop flavor continues and shifts over time.
[Edit:]  I will say that I had another one 2 months later that is very "fresh" and the sweet hop notes are overridden by the pungent hoppiness of a new batch.  I recommend letting it sit a while in both the fridge and the glass and you will be happier.
As expected, this is a flavor bomb that any lover of the style should be excited about getting their hands on.  Myself...  I feel privileged to have another one waiting for me in the fridge.  By many measures that makes me a wealthy man. 1,467 charactersdigboy, Jan 21, 2017

L: 2F+ head with good retention, leaves lots of foamy lacing and a cap and ring. Beer is a nice New England hazy pale bronze/orange.
S: Nose suggests it's none worse for the wear. Lots of nice citrus including grapefruit, orange, and lime, ripe and juicy. A promise of slight dankness and earthiness. Very nice.
T: Lots of grapefruit and lime. Slightly sour, as if the malts never quite come forward. A little bit of earthiness on the finish, but it's mostly an El Dorado citrus show.
F: Light to medium body. Light to medium carbonation. Good drying and balance. Very good construction.
O: A little bit of dead yeast/debris at the bottom of the glass. It happens. Another Trillium winner overall and I'm sure 4 weeks ago it was a little bit better. 906 charactersIvoryFoxhole, Jan 14, 2017

4.81/5  rDev +7.6%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75This is probably my favorite trillium offering so far and one that truly stands unique amongst the rest.  When you first crack the can, all you can smell is orange.  You don't even need to be close to it to notice the strong aroma.  Pours a light very hazy yellow orange that falls more towards the yellow side than the red spectrum.  About an inch of off white head that dissipates over the course of a few minutes leaving a ring around the edge of the glass with lacing throughout.  The smell of this beer is an orange bomb!  I love orange so I love the smell.  You also get a bit of lime on the very front of your nose, especially as the beer warms up.  Taste follows the smell with a pleasant not overly bitter back end.  Some of the street beers can be a bit too bitter for my tastes but this one has just the right amount for me.  It is sweet up front from the citrus nose but the middle is dry and it leaves a lingering citrus candy aftertaste from the hop resins.  The feel of this beer is medium thick with a moderately lively carbonation; has a nice body.  Overall this beer is great!  Awesome nose that is not ruined by an overtly bitter finish.  Citrusy and smooth. 1,177 charactersAmguerra305, Jan 06, 2017

Smells like pineapple juice; unbelievable how fruity and juicy this smells with so much citrus and fruit that the only way to describe it is fruit juice. Fantastic aroma to breath in, heavenly and all things hops.
Tastes so juicy that the citrus seems like citrus hop cones were squeezed to get the oil out and let the fruit juice flow. The fruit is abundant with green apple, pear, guava, mango, pineapple,  grapefruit, lemon and every tropical fruit you could think of. The malt backbone gets the sweet caramel and syrupy toast going in synch with the hoppy goodness and just makes for a fantastically balanced IPA. Simply delicious.
Great feel and bitterness level, this was a fantastic beer overall.
3/18/2017-Had another can dated 03/09/17 and it validated how good this beer is...looks great again, the nose has tropical fruit, caramel, melon, pineapple, biscuit, fresh cut grass and tangerine. Lovely to inhale again, with zesty hops and a lot of dynamic fruity aromas to breath in...it really does start things off right when a beer smells this good. Once again the flavors are outstanding. Grapefruit juice, peach, lemon, pineapple, guava, brown sugar, fresh zesty piney hops, tropical fruit, star fruit, green apple, and just tons of fruit. Really tastes fresh hopped from the double dry hopping and just makes for an incredibly tasty beer. Enough malt backbone and caramel sweetness to bring it all together, this is a really great DIPA, perfectly balanced IPA and world class in my view. 1,707 charactersCHickman, Dec 23, 2016

Smell not as the other ddh beers I have had.  Grapefruit dominates the nose. 
While the mouthfeel is very creamy and enjoyable, the taste was a bit of letdown.   A little more bitter than a typical ne ipa. Get the lime late mouthfeel.   
Overall-  very good beer but def far down the list for me in terms of trillium iPas.  A little too bitteR for an east coast ipa 404 charactersjcflorian, Dec 17, 2016

4.23/5  rDev -5.4%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Can dated 9/27. 
Pours gold with a deep haze, short of turbid. Minimal head and retention with some errant strings of lacing.
Aromatics are skunky, dank, and earthy. Grapefruit pith stuffed with weed. Light bodied with a soft mouthfeel. A bit thin. Pithy, resinous hops on the palate. Zero bitterness or malt. 
Finishes with plenty of dank, resinous hops.
Another tasty one from Trillium but is more on the dank side of the moon and less tropical. 449 charactersbrewandbbq, Oct 10, 2016

4.52/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Canned 9/27/16. Consumed 10/6/16.
A: Beer comes in a medium-plus hazy light orange with about a finger of pillowy white head that sticks around for a while. Thick rings of lacing stick to the glass, and alcohol legs are apparent.
S: Trillium's notes are spot on. Huge notes of lime, grapefruit juice, and orange peel. Subtle hints of earth, wood, and musty dankness, but the zesty, pithy, citrus notes are dominant, almost overwhelming.
T: Again, Trillium describes their own beer perfectly. Very floral up front with notes of grapefruit and navel orange. Light bready sweetness hits mid-mouth and transitions to a sweet, almost candied citrus on the finish. Here, I get grapefruit and a reappearance of that huge lime note I picked up on the nose. Lingering sweet grapefruit/lime flavor sticks to the palate.
M: Medium weight on the palate with a great balance of sweetness and bitterness. Lingering aftertaste is accompanied by medium sweetness and medium bitterness to pleasantly sit on the tongue long after the swallow. It's not quite creamy, but the carbonation is smooth enough to make for a very drinkable beer, despite the intensity of flavor it packs.
O: As with all the DDH versions of the Street series beers, this is an excellent showcase of El Dorado. It packs a TON of flavor and aroma into a beer around 7% while offering a simple, clean malt bill that balances out the intense dry-hopping without much distraction. As with all beers in this series, overall opinion basically hinges on affinity for the highlighted hop. For me, El Dorado is a very enjoyable hop, but one that I prefer to be used in conjunction with others. The pungent notes of lime, grapefruit and earthy flowers are not my favorite, but they're still quite good. It's a very well executed IPA that I'd happily enjoy again! 1,812 charactersavas, Oct 07, 2016

A - Poured into a Kate the Great tulip a nice hazy golden orange hue with one finger head that fades to leave light lacing and wisps. 
S - Aromas of light citrus, nice pith, good light pine, generically bitter.
T - Taste is similar to the nose, fair amount of bitterness, nice melons, good orange citrus. The melon aspect is very pleasant.
M - Mouthfeel is lightly carbonated, bit thin, watery. 
O - Overall this was a rather underwhelming ipa. The melon was nice, but, everything else was weak.

Nose some spicy hop, little rind and melon, little stone fruit, citrus, grapefruit pith, malty character, touch spicy pine and little earthy, melon rind, papaya, tropical fruit flavored Popsicle.
Taste more, soft fruits, loads of papaya, citrus, big orange creamscicle, grapefruit , little tangerine, stone fruit, and melon, rind, mild sweet creamy malt. Finish dry spicy earthy hop, more grapefruit rind and tangerine citrus, big spicy.
Mouth is med bod, little creamy, decent carb
Overall much better this time around, last one must have been mishandled or batch adjustment for the new brewery, or something, this one was worlds better than the last time I had this beer thankfully, since El Dorado should be a lot better. 830 charactersjlindros, Oct 07, 2016

4.31/5  rDev -3.6%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25A- A tall can drops a hazy golden yellow brew into a tall chalice. Atop that beer a thick and creamy white cap rises up to about a half inch high with good retention. Wide sheets of lace coat a large area on the glass.
S- Juicy and extremely bright thanks to a very intense grapefruit and lime citrus juice presence from the hops. As one would expect the hops dominate with the aforementioned plus peach, mango, pineapple, orange, onion and passionfruit.
T- The taste brings a similar balance as the aroma did but it does shift from juicy to a bit more zesty with the advent of the bitterness in the flavor profile. Mainly about the notes of pineapple, mango, peach, grapefruit with intense pine resin, melon, dank herbs, floral and tangerine hints beyond those.
MF- Luscious and creamy medium body with high end carbonation. Finishes with a sharp and zesty citrus bitterness lingering on the taste buds.
An amazingly bright aroma of citrus and tropical fruits leads into a good but not mind blowing flavor profile which seems to lose some steam to the bitterness present muddling the distinct things found in the smell. Better than most but not one of the best Trillium IPAs. 1,180 characterscbutova, Oct 06, 2016

Perhaps the can was mis-handled or the batch a bit off. I will try it again and update my review as warranted. 316 charactersKidDoc, Sep 09, 2016

This one pours a super hazy golden yellow color, with a big one inch head, and a little bit of lacing.
Smells like tangerine, earthy pine and grassiness, some definite lime (as indicated by the can), and marijuana.
This is pretty unique amongst Trillium IPAs in how earthy and herbal it is- must be the El Dorado hops. There's tons of juicy fruity hop character too of course, but with a bitter, earthy, and dry, almost dirty feeling underpinning everything. It's very enjoyable.
This has a creamy and very full mouthfeel for the style. Like most DDH Trillium beers- it feels like I'm drinking actual liquid hops.
This is a really unique beer amongst all of the awesome uber hopped Trillium beers. I really enjoyed it. 755 charactersGreesyFizeek, Sep 05, 2016

Pours a hazy burnt orange with a loose, half inch, cream-colored head that settles into a soapy froth.  Amazing nose!  Guava, citrus and pith.  Taste is more pithy and dank than tropical fruit with some resinous qualities that linger between quaffs.  Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a prickly carbonation, light acidity and a residual burn at the finish.  Another awesome IPA from the crew at Trillium.  The nose is incredible! 531 charactersJwale73, Aug 30, 2016

Retention is excellent and lacing is fantastic. Smell is exactly as advertised, definitely getting the lime, grapefruit and earthiness. Taste is the same, but a little more subdued than the smell. Feel is light, soft, clean and juicy. Overall an excellent beer. Never gotten lime scent or taste before in a beer and it is definitely different. Not my favorite citrus note in a beer, but still excellent. 513 charactersCNoj012, Apr 21, 2016

Back to the fridge for another bottle of Trillium.
Appearance is an opaque and straw colored.
Smell is one of the sweetest I can recall. There's a little grassiness, but it's dominated by pineapple, with a little mango.
The taste has the pineapple, but not as sweet. Some banana and honeydew melon, and there's some lactic taste, too. There's also some citrus that I can best describe as sour nectarine, but it's in the background. Nothing is out of balance, it all goes together nicely.
Feel is slightly carbonated, and it's nice and smooth.
I'm glad I have one more bottle. 627 charactersZythophile, Apr 18, 2016
4.25/5  rDev -4.9%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Incredibly unique but just not a flavor profile that works for me. As Trillium describes, very floral. Huge lime notes. If you've had kaffir lime leaves in anything, that's the biggest flavor component. Far too sweet for me, candied. They say grapefruit, but to me I get a tangerine element, but slightly soured ... like how orange juice gets an alchohol note as it goes bad / sour. The woody note is very far in the back, buried a bit underneath a citrus pith bitterness. I really want a bit more bite / IBU from hops to bring this sweetness into balance. 556 charactersKurmaraja, Apr 18, 2016

The aroma of this beer is overwhelming.  Room is overcome with tropical fruit notes.  Mango, papaya, orange, pineapple.  Mouthfeel is soft and pillowy.  Alcohol notes are non-existent.  Everything you'd want from a New England IPA and more. 337 charactersStephenPizzi, Apr 07, 2016

Trillium cannot go wrong with their double dry hopped beers.  Intense smell and flavor of lime and grapes/grapefruit as alluded to in their description. 
I am usually ok with but not a big fan of El Dorado beers, but this was fantastic!  I will buy this in multiples in the future... 351 charactersNewport_beerguy, Apr 03, 2016

S: Bomb. A mango and pineapple juice bomb with some dank citrus hop notes lurking. Smells incredible.
T: The taste doesn't quite stack up for me. On the maltier side of IPAs, especially for Trillium. Still incredibly clean. Light bready malt, mango, grapefruit and just a touch of green onion. Finished with just a tinge of grapefruit pith and resin. Another tasty beer from them, but not one of my favorites. 565 charactersnotchucknorris, Apr 01, 2016

Pours like most other Trillium beers.. straight up orange juice, super hazy, not much light gets through this one.. head is big frothy and bold, leaves lots of lacing and a good amount of retention. The epitome of a New England IPA by looks.
Aromas.. straight up PINEAPPLE JUICE! Tropical fruits all over but pineapple is the big guy here, citrus, watermelon, grapefruit, mango are all potent and ever present. Perfect aromas, so tropical and juicy. 
On the tongue is more tropical fruits, lots of grapefruit, citrus, tropical fruit, pineapple, finishes ever so lightly bitter. A little sweet. Medium body, low carbonation. 
Loved it.. I swear they add juice to these.. 763 charactersgcamparone, Mar 30, 2016

4.58/5  rDev +2.5%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Made my first trip to Trillium this past Friday and picked this up along with 9 other bombers.
Appearance: Pours a luminous and hazy golden orange. About two fingers of super creamy head. Quite a bit of lacing. Really digging the look of all of these Trillium beers: they all seem to glow in a glass.
Smell: Didn't need to stick my nose in this one to dig out any aroma, that's for sure. Absolutely massive assault of lemon and lime zest upfront, with some grapefruit and orange aroma at the backend. Almost gives me a bit of a lemon shaved-ice vibe. Very assertive, but very crisp.
Taste: Damn, if the nose was assertive the taste is even more so. Huge pop of bitter lemon and lime that segues into an orange candy aftertaste than becomes more apparent as the beer warms. Huge flavors at play here.
Mouthfeel: Considerably thick and juicy, but finished remarkably dry. If anything, the initial pop of bitterness is a bit aggressive for me; very prickly on the tongue and front of the mouth. I almost think I'm detecting alcohol here, but I'm fairly positive it's just aggressive hop oil flavors.
Overall: A crazy-delicious beer that's only downfall is just that it's too assertive to be balanced. That said though, damn. Wish I had purchased more than a single bomber of this. Curious to see how DDH Congress Street fares in comparison to this one. 1,354 charactersTomMorris, Mar 22, 2016

S: Clementines, lemons, and grapefruit on the nose with a soft dankness

F: Requisite Trillium soft and medium-bodied mouthfeel 
O: This was fantastic - another phenomenal offering from Trillium showcasing a very tasty hop in El Dorado. This surpassed my expectations and was much less acerbic than I imagined prior to tasting it. Sweet, juicy, soft, and dank - all good things. Well played, Trillium. 741 charactersFireman_RK, Mar 19, 2016

S - Daaaaaayyyyuuum son, gots to be mosaic. tons of tropical fruit with mixed in earthy bark and rain forest trees, lots of danky qualities..... my favorite.
T - Follows through with the danky tropics, way less earthy taste than expected.  Maybe city hops coming through now on the taste?  Kinda reminds me of a softer Focal Banger.  All juice, all sweet, all Fing awesome.  Love this beer. definitely one of Trilliums best.
F - Soft and cold as the other side of the pillow. Sweetness coats the throat and total bliss encompasses the brain, I don't know, its awesome.
O - I feel like I'm trying my best to knock this beer on the smallest imperfections but its soooo unfair because there is so much to love here.  This is incredible, might be Trilliums best offering yet (which is crazy given their amazing selection) 897 charactersM_chav, Oct 26, 2015

3.78/5  rDev -15.4%look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.75Honestly, kinda shocked at the love here. Either that, or this brew travels super poorly. I think, though, that mostly this is a case of this particular hop profile (plus some travel issues) not working out for me. Heavily hazed dark orange body. I see folks post pics of stuff like this in bright daylight, and it does indeed look better, but under normal night time lighting, it's not especially attractive, just sorta muddy looking. As usual with Trillium brews, though, the head and lacing are top class. Nose is sort of generically fruity, neither the tropical fruit forwardness of their Citra/Nelson/Galaxy-oriented brews, nor more classic citrus/pine. It kinda made me think of Stone's Delicious IPA, which in turn makes me think this is a personal issue with El Dorado hops, as that beer didn't work a ton for me either. Is it sort of richly fruity (some places mention watermelon in El Dorado, and I guess I can see it maybe, though it's not particularly alluring), in the Trillium-style, all saturated and such? Kinda, although there's a distinctive malty note that, combined with the fruitiness and saturation, not to mention a sort of tangy yeasty note, makes this smell a bit like overripe fruit. Again, I think it pales in comparison to the clarity, pop, and depth of something like Pier. On the palate, it continues to struggle to get out of first gear, more overripe fruit, some decent bitterness. I don't know. I can't figure out if this is personal preference, Trillium brews having poor shelf stability (I drank this 23 days after bottling), or what. Clearly, I'm in the minority on this one. But, to my palate, this is the weakest Trillium offering I've had. 1,678 charactersbreadwinner, Oct 25, 2015

As a Californian who just received a box full of Tree House & Trillium beers all canned and bottled within the same month, all I can say is WOW. You can keep the Pats and the Sox, I just want your breweries!
Bottle on date was smudged, but I can make out that this was bottled in October. Today is October 17th. As fresh as I'm going to ever have this beer. Nose and taste mirror each other perfectly. Melons, Guava, passion Fruit, hint of bubble gum. Light Pine on the back end keeping this dry on the finish, but upfront nice and juicy. Soft pillowy mouthfeel, while the carbonation and bitterness is perfect here, keeping the finish sharp, crisp and effervescent. This keeps you coming back for sip after sip after sip. This is hands down one of the best single IPAs I've ever had.

Some chocolate covered oranges, which I'm not crazy about. As with most Trillium IPAs, it has a soft mouthfeel. There is also that chalkiness that I also have found in Congress St, which I personally enjoy.

Pours a hazy vibrant pale orange in color with a finger of short-lived white head, appearance is reminiscent of orange juice. Aroma Intensely hoppy, lots of orange, some mango, peach, grapefruit with moderate resin and pine notes. Taste follows the aroma, very hoppy; a good amount of orange but with a substantial Resiny pine presence. A subtle biscuit malt profile supportsbthe hops, moderate bitterness. Medium-light body, moderate carbonation. Overall a very good beer. Wonderful aroma and great taste; I'm a big Trillium fan but this just didnt do it for me. There isn't anything that is blatantly wrong here but this beer just didnt quite add up for me. 695 charactersmnj21655, Oct 03, 2015

S - peach.  Lime.  Sweet fruit flesh.  Maybe a touch of grass in the back.
T - follows the nose.  Lime juice with underlying ripe peach.  Tart finish with bitter citrus rind.
M - medium-low carb.  A little sticky.  Medium bodied.
O - not a ton of depth, certainly a hop bomb, but the juicy flavor profile is right up my ally.  Reminds me of an early batch of NS Morph that was very lime forward, but this throws a ton of peach in the mix. 586 charactersAirBob, Apr 21, 2015

Appearance: Hazy golden orange with a big fluffy off-white head. Decent retention leaves a small cap for the duration. Moderate to light carbonation on the pour. Big chunks and notches of sticky lacing. Looks like most Trillium pale ale iterations, which isn't a bad thing. 
Smell: Orange juice. Orange skin and pith. Tangerine. Pushes of grapefruit, lime zest, and some mango. Deeply tropical. Touches of oily pine as well. Malt base offers the typical slight breadiness coupled with some caramelized malt sweetness. Slight powdery yeast. Loaded with peach, lots and lots of peach. Some mild toasted elements as well.
Taste: Peach jumps out faster than it did on the nose. Some dank elements in the back coupled with lime zest. Lightly caramelized and toasted malts. Slightly sweet. Tangerine, hints of grapefruit, mango in abundance, and some pine oil. Slight breadiness/undercooked biscuit dough. Pineapple. As tropical as the nose indicates with a touch more lime buried in the back. Some bitterness with a mild herbal edge. Juicy and fleshy and fruity. Clean outside of the lingering bitterness.
Mouthfeel: Slightly creamy mediumish body with a moderate to light carbonation. Smooth. 
Overall: Definitely not a sleeper.
It's typical Trillium goodness. The hops are deeply tropical with more lime and peach than is typical. Like Hill Farmstead I maintain it's the same base beer with different hop profiles. That's a success profile. 1,486 charactersGoblinmunkey7, Mar 10, 2015

Nice nose, very similar Trillium IPA flavor.  Nice citrus flavor with a hint of anise.  Similar to Mastermind for my palate.  Very nice beer.
A step below DDH FPPA and Vicinity, which are both standard bearers.

4.31/5  rDev -3.6%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Bottle from thegerm. Thanks man! Poured after Galaxy Fort Point on 3/2/15, bottle dated 2/11/15. Pours hazy golden color with a creamy, fluffy white head on top. Aroma is a bit more malt forward than the GFP, with sweet notes of honey and melon, mango, pineapples, tropical citrus. Flavor is sweet papaya and melon, some pineapple in the background, low bitter and higher on the sweetness. Medium bodied, medium low carbonation, dank and more syrupy than the others (not in a bad way). Some interesting malty bready flavors lingering on the finish. A good bit of lower level from others from Trillium that I've had thus far. Almost like sweet melon juice and the hops are surprisingly mellow here given the supposed large dry hop. Nice. 736 charactersBMMillsy, Mar 03, 2015

Appearance: Turbid, hazy yellowish-orange color, with a bright white head. Tons of lacing, that lingers on the glass throughout drinking. Excellent retention.
Smell: Very juicy and tropical smelling, much like Vicinity from Trillium. A hint less than Vicinity, but still very pleasant. A somewhat prevalent weedy, resinous aroma in the background of the fruit.
Taste: Most of the juicy citrus flavors come through first, tasting like mango and tangerine. Finishes a little bit bitter, but the tropical flavor is still there.
Taste: Delicious. I get some light biscuity malt, with heavy citrus rind and juice flavors. Stays true to the style in that it delivers a relative juice-bomb with some weedy, residual bitterness as well. The overwhelming flavor, though, is the citrus and tropical fruit.
Feel: Quite medium-bodied compared with stickier IPAs, but smooth at 7.1% ABV. Tastes linger for a short period of time on the palate.
Overall: A REALLY, REALLY good IPA. I liked it just as much as Congress St. but less so than Vicinity, comparing to other Trillium offerings. If it was more closely available to me, I'd drink it all the time. 1,194 charactersTheElectricOne, Feb 21, 2015

021115
Served in a pint glass
Super cloudy, yellow ochre appearance. The liquid was topped by a tight, frothy, inch tall, off white crown that quickly fell to a thin film and a bubbly collar. Despite the mediocre head retention, a patchy, drippy wall of lacing coated the glass.
The aroma was super fruity and juicy. Crisp, zesty and bright. Uber citrusy. Orange juice dominated, along with some tangerine and clementine notes. Tropical fruits also came through. Passionfruit was most noticeable. Good amount of mango. There was an intensely dank, weed-like quality as well. 
The flavor profile was very similar to the aroma, except even punchier. Amazingly juicy, fruity and sweet. Tangerine and orange notes were most apparent. This almost reminded me of drinking orange juice. Hint of tropical fruitiness. Juicy Fruit gum came to mind. Passion fruit and mango were detectible. Like in the nose, there was a marijuana-like dankness. Tart, lemony notes came through on the back end and in the finish. Touch of pithy and dry orange peel. Just a tad bitter.
The liquid was medium bodied for the style and contained a fine, mild effervescence. Super soft and creamy on the palate. Smooth and supple.
With all the amazing pale ales, IPAs and double IPAs (and variations of each) that Trillium Brewing keeps cranking out, it is easy to see how some can get lost in the fray. While Double Dry Hopped Sleeper Street might not break new ground, it is still an amazing offering and perhaps their most juicy and drinkable hoppy beer to date. 1,621 charactersDamian, Feb 16, 2015

Taste very similar to the nose, with a little more bitter grapefruit, and even some more herbal, grassy flavours.
Very smooth, lightly carbed, with a an overall sweet taste. A little dryness from the bitter grapefruit, but it's pretty light. Dry sticky finish. 489 charactersIan_B, Feb 16, 2015

Hop induced fruit purée. Genuinely smells like tangerines. Pineapples as well. All hops; all fruit. Very, very citrusy. Flavor has some greener, grassier elements. It still brings the citrus smoothie parade right down the middle. Clementine and tangerine, oh lawd! Malt is sweet but very well placed next to the hops. Sweet, doughy, pastry maltiness. High carbonation. Medium bodied. Surprisingly not overly bitter. Trillium doing Trillium things yet again. 562 charactersVelvetExtract, Feb 14, 2015

Appearance: Pours a light amber/yellowish gold and leaves a finger of white head that lingers for a bit before fading to a white layer atop the beer, with some bubbles. (4.75)
Smell: Big time orange/clementine with some lemon as well. Smells like the direct citrus fruit, rather than the "flavor". The hops truly dominate the aroma. Really nice. (4.75)
Taste: That big orange flavor upfront, with a bit of grassiness, spruce and a hint of grapefruit to round it out. Really drinkable flavor - the citrus/orange isn't too strong - just right. A hop bomb for sure, with everything else taking a back seat. Really pleasant. (4.75)
Mouth-feel: Medium carb with a medium body. Has a "juicy" feel to it, which works really well. Fantastic feel to it. (5)
Overall: This is a fantastic, tasty, drinkable IPA with big citrus (especially orange) flavors to it. A wonderful body and some grassy/bready hints in the background - I could drink a lot of this. I've had other beers with this level of orange/citrus, but this is better balanced than those. (4.75) 1,134 charactersResuin, Feb 13, 2015
