Smell of maple, light smokiness, and even a little chocolate. Just the right amount of maple on the taste, the bacon has a subtle presence underneath. Very smooth, not oily at all, and the flavors blend together well. Killer brew. 336 charactersmschrei, Jun 19, 2017

Appearance- A dark black with about a finger of darker tan head which faded quickly. A nice sticky lacing down the glass. 
Smell- Dark chocolate,  a deep roasted coffee, and maple syrup mixed to perfection. It reminded me of hot chocolate mix served with breakfast pancakes.  I really did not get any of the bacon in the smell. The smell says hurry up and take a drink. 
Taste- Maple syrup to the maximum. The coffee and chocolate are almost an aftertaste for the my first sip. More complex of a mix as I continued. Some vanilla and smokey malt flavors start coming through with a little saltiness. It is smooth and drinkable with no hint of the high alcohol content. 
Mouthfeel- Low carbonation with a sticky feel left behind. It lingers so nicely. 
Overall- My first experience from Funky Buddha and it was so impressive. A maple syrup bomb with chocolate and a dark brew kicker. Get it if you can find it. 977 charactersKdouble, Jun 09, 2017

4.6/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I looked at this beer from about 28 different angles before I finally decided to purchase it.  It was the bacon - what's bacon doing in a beer?
In this case, it's merely offering a very slightly salty counterpoint to the sweetness of the maple syrup, which is awesome:  it's like the kettle corn of the beer nerd world.
The pour resembles an imperial stout - jet black, dark tan head.  The nose is all about the coffee and maple syrup, especially the maple.  I am SOOOOO Jonesin' for some pancakes right now.
The bacon makes its appearance on the taste as a salty flavor to ease you past the maple syrup and into the coffee.  
Exceptionally well executed - and my first beer from these guys, too! 700 charactersovaltine, May 29, 2017

4.85/5  rDev +7.3%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 52017 vintage, pours pitch black color with a solid 1-2 finger foamy dark tan head that was full of tiny bubbles and faded very slowly, leaving very good foamy lacing coating the sides and rings as it went down. 
Smells like maple syrup, cinnamon French toast, burnt coffee grinds, dark chocolate, cocoa powder, molasses, brown sugar, roasted malt, charred wood, toffee and smoked meat. Very complex and like Maple Bacon Coffee Porter it's both wonderful to inhale and makes me think bacon was used in the mash. Craft beer aromas at it's finest.
Tastes of maple syrup, burnt coffee grinds, dark chocolate, French toast, smoked malts, cocoa powder, molasses, vanilla, bitter black coffee, chocolate, heavy cream, roasted grains and charred wood. The sweetness is a mix of maple syrup, toffee, caramel, brown sugar, molasses, lactose sugar, heavy cream and then an odd salty flavor, which again was similar to Maple Bacon Coffee Porter. Late additions this time include espresso, oats, more dark chocolate, nutty accents, chocolate syrup and a combo of liqueur and vanilla hazelnut heavy cream. Crazy how flavorful and dynamic this beer is, each sip is slightly different and extremely enjoyable. A home run, this is bold, flavorful and a lot of fun to drink. Add in the facts that it's incredibly smooth feeling and hides the ABV masterfully, and we have ourselves a world class beer.
Last Snow may be my favorite beer from Funky Buddha, but this is their best. 1,462 charactersCHickman, May 21, 2017

Taste follows the noise with a strong sugary maple flavor, then some coffee and maybe mocha with a small taste of caramel.
This beer is smooth and pretty thick for a porter. Very small amount of carbonation,

The beer pours dark black and I had about 2 inches of mocha chocolate milk coloured head creeping up the glass. It dissipates with a little time and leaves about a quarter inch tan/espresso ring around the glass. The beer has a very strong coffee and maple syrup nose.  The taste is incredible.  I have had this beer many times and this vintage was the most chocolatey I have ever tasted.  The fudge with coffee roast worked exceptionally well together and the sweet syrup was also prevalent but not one note dominated the other and they all played harmoniously together.  The "bacon" smoke which I would get faint notes of in prior iterations of this beer were absent this go around. This beer had excellent body to it and could easily pass for a stout.  A classic breakfast beer done exceptionally well. 949 charactersJAStheAce, Apr 24, 2017
4.48/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.52017 release.  About a week old.
A: Pours black with a thick cap of dense, espresso-like head. Excellent retention and intricate lacing. 
S: A delicious punch of sweetish vanilla ice cream-covered maple syrup dominates the aroma.  Mild supporting roast,  bacon, and dark molasses. A bit of coffee but fairly mild. 
T: Follows the nose with a bit more roastiness which lingers on through the finish.  Coffee is extremely light.  The roast cuts through a moderate sweetness that complements the other flavors nicely.
M: Medium body—a bit too thin for what they’re going for, with medium-light carbonation. Slightly creamy and sticky. 
O: Liquid breakfast in a glass. Not terribly different from MBCP, besides the slightly bigger flavor, roast, and gravity, but that's far from a bad thing. 796 characterspmarlowe, Apr 24, 2017

My goodness, that nose!  At first pour, while the head settled, it smelled like booze and red grapes.  Now settled in the glass, I'm getting maple syrup and bacon from across the room. Up close, the maple syrup is even stronger, although one can also start to detect some roasted barley, vanilla, and coffee. As the beer warms, the coffee becomes even more pronounced, the beer more delectable.
Quite sweet on the palate, as expected. There's only hints throughout of slightly smoky bacon, as well as a roasted barley base. At first, the sweetness is more general, and some coffee comes through; about halfway through, a woody maple syrup quality grows and comes to dominate the back third. Perhaps a touch of charred bacon on the absolute finish, along with touches of coffee.
Sticky, rich, sweet; if ST Creme Brulee is too sweet for some, I can't imagine they'll be able to make it through a glass of this!  The maple is by far the dominant flavor, and while that's pleasant, it does make for a sickly sweet treat.
I recommend having this beer approximately at room temperature.  The coffee comes out much stronger, and all the flavors meld together so much better. The maple is still dominant, but far more integrated. An unbelievably good beer. 1,381 charactersRoguer, Apr 23, 2017

L- Thick creamy and rocky khaki colored head that stands 1 finger tall,with very good retention and extremely sticky lacing.The body is pitch black l,with absolutely no light showing through the glass.Hard to tell how much carbonation there is with the dark color.
S- The nose is almost identical to the original Maple Bacon Coffee Porter,only they are much more intense and pronounced.Heavy notes of maple syrup,fresh dark roasted coffee,smokey / salty fried bacon.This beer smells like breakfast...only better!!! Some dark toasted malts in there as well.But this beer definitely lives up to its description.
T- The palate follows the nose with dark roasted coffee up front,thick maple syrup in the middle,and a salty and smokey yet surprisingly sweet finish.This tastes just like the original MBCP,only it is much more thick,rich,and sweet.It also has a more salty and smokey after taste.Wide Awake also has a much sweeter flavor than MBCP too.The palate is a straight up 5 in my book.
F- The mouth feel is very heavy,and extremely sticky.Very little oxidation on the tongue,with a silky smooth finish.This is an extremely thick and heavy beer.
O- This beer is amazing.It is just like the original MBCP only thicker,richer,and more flavorful,if that is even imaginable.The flavors and aromas are even more powerful than the original.This beer is incredible.If you like a thick,dark,breakfast beer this is the one for you.I would drink this all year long,if it was available year round,and I wasn't moving to Massachusetts.Will definitely drink this one again,and I highly recommend it.Funky Buddha does it, once again!!! 1,840 charactersDraconusDesanctus666, Apr 21, 2017
4.46/5  rDev -1.3%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5This bottle was over a year old.
It is pretty much the same as the MBCP, except the body is fuller to me. It borders on an imperial stout in this area. The coffee flavor was a bit more muted, but it is an older bottle. Lots of maple. The slightly smoky, candied bacon is subtle, but noticeable. This is right up there with CBS as far as maple/ maple coffee beers go, and I imagine fresh I would prefer this one over the regular MBCP.
Edit: had it on tap too. A 10oz pour revealed the same faint coffee and the bacon/smokiness is nowhere near MBCP. Still an excellent beer, but I think I like the reg/original better 617 charactersWesMantooth, Apr 20, 2017

4.07/5  rDev -10%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4Dark as you would expect for a coffee stout with a very minimal head.
Nose is largely coffee right out of the refrigerated bottle with more maple coming through as it warms.
Great coffee taste, but I'm not getting as much maple as a lot of other reviewers. Certainly as it warms the maple comes around, but it isn't quite the maple bomb that regular MBCP was in my opinion. Decent dark chocolate notes, but nothing too fudgey like far too many other big stouts seem to tend toward.
More thin than I was expecting, until I remembered that it's a Funky Budda beer. I've yet to be blown away by the mouthfeel of any of their beers, and this is no exception. I wouldn't go so far as to call it watery, but it isn't chewy like a BCBS or Abraxas.
Overall, it's solid. I think I prefer the regular MBCP's ability to showcase the flavors over this brew's more alcohol centric approach. If I were in Florida and saw it for sale I would buy it, but I don't know that I would trade for a bottle again. 994 charactersAngerhaus, Feb 14, 2017

Tremendous flavors - it is a maple syrup bomb, but still nicely balanced. Could use a little more thickness in the feel, but that is nitpicking. Can't wait to try the BA version! 284 charactersArkyVaughan, Jan 30, 2017

Pours near black with cola edges. A half-inch khaki head forms and quickly disappears completely leaving no lace. The smell is of maple syrup, smoky bacon, chocolate and a hint of coffee. The taste follows with maple being the most evident component and the coffee element being very subtle. Full texture with low carbonation. As advertised, a unique sweet, decadent offering. 398 charactersFurlinator, Nov 08, 2016

Smell is to die for - lovely strong maple syrup aroma with notes of smoked malts, coffee and molasses. 
Taste has notes of maple syrup, smoked malts, bacon, coffee, roasted coffee beans, molasses. It really captures breakfast in a glass. There is a touch of alcohol on the finish, buts its actually a welcome balance to the sweetness of the beer. 
Feel is spot on - medium carbonation, smoooooth velvety almost creamy mouthfeel. 
Overall this is an incredible beer - it lives up to the hype and then some. 611 charactersFBarber, Oct 09, 2016

From a bomber into a snifter
Imperial version of Maple Bacon Coffee Porter
APPEARANCE: Clear black pour yields a 2+ finger, medium looking, slightly foamy tan head with great retention. Black body with no real carbonation evident. Head slowly fades to a foamy cap and clings to the sides of the glass. Ring and faint wisp remain with touches of lacing down the glass. 
SMELL: Piles of maple syrup with obvious coffee as well. Sweet cream, vanilla, milk chocolate, butterscotch and lovely maple on the nose. Bold and very enticing. 
TASTE: Maple sweetness with butterscotch, light smoky bacon flavors, and a good dose of coffee and cream at the swallow. Bolder and lingering finish with maple and butterscotch sweetness, vanilla cream, some milk chocolate, light smoked notes, and a well-measured dose of bitter and slightly burnt coffee. A touch of booze but not much. 
PALATE: Medium body and medium levels of carbonation. Creamy on the palate, goes down fine and finishes quite sticky on the palate. A bit of heat lingers. 
OVERALL: This is really good. Usually bigger doesn’t mean better is true, but definitely not in this case. Where I found the regular Maple Bacon Coffee Porter to be a little lack luster, this one hits all the right notes. Big, bold, full, and loaded with character. The barrel aged Morning Wood is all this plus a well-measured barrel, which is even more out of this world. Quality stuff and I’m sure it’s been a source of inspiration for other brewers out there. Thanks again Peensteen. Highly, highly recommended. 1,615 charactersJeffo, Sep 27, 2016

Dark body, near black, medium viscosity, small collar. The aroma is where this beer begins to take off. Oh my. Chocolate, vanilla, smores, breakfast sausage, maple. The flavor is also top notch, following the aroma. Medium bodied with soft carbonation. Complex and absolutely delicious. 362 charactersHuhzubendah, Sep 14, 2016

4.79/5  rDev +6%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Comes out looking black but a little thin, nice big tan head settles down and leaves rings of lace. 
Smell on this thing is like IHOP in a bottle... Ridiculous smoke and maple syrup. Taste is the same, everything you expect us right there and it's amazing how well it's captured. 
Feel is medium and I'd like a little more, but it's thicker than the pour led on. Oily, but not sticky. Very sweet beer, but the smoke/salt cuts through it and produces a nice balance. 
Overall this is just fantastic, and reminds me a lot of Double Stack except maybe with better balance. Time to get some Morning Wood! 603 charactersGreatStoutman, Sep 10, 2016
4.75/5  rDev +5.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Small snifter from World of Beer, Tampa, FL.  
 Appearance was as expected from this style, dark and beautiful lacing. 
 Aroma was amazing, camp fire breakfast in a glass. 
Taste was tremendous.  Maple upfront followed by smoky, creamy chocolate infused bacon (hard to imagine). 
Mouthfeel was medium bodied which is surprising with such intense flavor.
Overall the best liquid I've ever experienced.  Planning a trip to the brewery for the next release. 460 characterssorthcj, Sep 08, 2016

Aroma-   Wow,  smells like breakfast.  Coffee prominent upfront.  Smokiness from the bacon clearly evident .  Tremendous 
Taste-  I was blown away by the smell of this beer.  That being said I was slightly let down by the taste.  Not bad but not the mind blowing experience I expected.   Very good but not great 
Mouthfeel-  coats the mouth nicely .  Medium mouthfeel, thinner than expected but still appropriate for style .  
Overall-  well worthy of top 250 status,  and aroma is unreal ,  but a little let down by the tastes.  This is a rock solid beer but not elite level. 648 charactersjcflorian, Aug 27, 2016

Smell is massive coffee and maple syrup, chocolate and vanilla and some roast, the bacon notes are subtle but this is essentially like sitting at a breakfast counter in a diner. Taste has a dominant  coffee flavour upfront, roast and chocolate, again bacon is subtle, maple syrup after the coffee flavours, long coffee aftertaste. Light-medium carbonation, medium-full body. Incredible, the nose alone makes this worth seeking out, would love to revisit this. 507 characterspeensteen, Aug 10, 2016

If the MCBP was the jab that knocked me silly, this was the knockout blow. Everything that MCBP was, this had dialed up, with the added booziness from the 10% ABV. This isn’t breakfast the morning after, this is breakfast while you’re still out partying. 354 charactersstevoj, Aug 02, 2016

4.49/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5650ml bottle. Served in a stemmed glass.
Pours a dark cola brown body, nearly black, half finger offwhite head, good retention, no lacing. Looks pretty standard. Smell is really something else, lots of maple sweetness, dark chocolate, big black coffee bite, light smokiness on the background. Sweet caramel and roasted malt hang around a bit, as well. Smells like breakfast. Flavour is MBCP on steroids, and I think this is what everyone is hoping for when they open a bottle of MBCP, some of which have been lacking as of late- big maple syrup presence, caramel, dark chocolate, light smoke, plenty of coffee, milk chocolate sweetness and a bit of roasted malt. Dang. Like everyone else says, breakfast in a bomber. Medium-fuller bodied, improved upon MBCP, substantial and slightly sticky. Sweet maple syrup and light smoke on the finish. An overall winner here; this is every bit as good as its barrel-aged version, Morning Wood. 933 charactersStevedore, Jul 10, 2016

Cloying, sticky maple syrup hits me right up front, with coffee, chocolate, and lightly roasted malt. Some alcohol is also detectable.
Chocolatey coffee sneaks in the taste before maple comes barreling through in a big way. There is not a lot of the smokiness or bacon that I was expecting, but there is a bit of pecan which I guess for me is actually a preferable substitute. A bit of that porter tang comes in, with hints of vanilla. There's no mistaking it, this is a sweet beer.
Nothing surprising here aside from the lack of bacon. I find this beer to be a lot like the leftover syrup on a plate when your done with breakfast--it's quite powerful, but enticing enough to make you go back in for just another nip at it. 864 charactersSabtos, Jul 09, 2016

4.34/5  rDev -4%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25Dark pour with about a finger of head. Smells like maple, roast coffee, very faint smoke. Tastes of chocolate, maple, roast coffee, and a light smokey flavor to match the nose. Also, the smoke flavor did not have a "bacon-like" profile that the label would lead you to believe. The coffee flavor becomes more forward as the beer warms. Feel was fairly sticky and thick with only a light feel of carbonation. Overall, a tasty beer with a great mouthfeel and all flavors represented. I thought the maple came through very well, while the coffee and smoke flavors were present, they were not expressed as well as the maple. 620 charactersOleDixie, Jun 30, 2016

A:  Blackish brown with a tan half finger head that hung out.

M:  Medium with medium to heavy carbonation.  Thick and decadent.
O:  Of all the coffee stouts I've tried, Funky Buddha brews it up better than most.  This is an amazing brew that I'd love to try again and again.  Wow! 588 charactersbrewskifan55, Jun 23, 2016

Smell:  Dark chocolate, roast and coffee, with hints of maple and smoke
Taste:  Chocolate, roast and coffee tones forward with the more subtle elements of caramel, maple and smoke arriving in the middle; a bit of warmth in the finish as all the flavors merge, but this one hides the ABV well
Mouthfeel:  Full bodied and somewhat creamy; moderate carbonation; some warmth in the gullet

LOOL: A fingers worth of khaki into a line with 25 seconds. Black in color with a ruby luster. Riding bubbles are small and nearly nonexistent. Lacing is thin and subtle.
SMELL: Strong aromas of coffee, syrup, and sweet chocolate intertwined with mild vanilla create an undoubtedly sweet aroma that is balanced by subtle aromas of hickory smoked bacon and hints of alcohol and bitter roasted malts. 
TASTE: An eruption of strong syrup and sweet chocolate flavors instantly smother the palate and satiate any and all sugary desires. Cloying is prevented as mild smoked bacon and coffee flavors instantaneously follow while syrup flavors grow stronger. Subtle vanilla flavors enter mid palate to add a little more sweetness and a dash of complexity. The taste theatrical finishes with subtle flavors of salt, alcohol, and bitter roasted malt as all previous flavors maintain.
FEEL: Incredibly full-bodied who hints of carbonation. Goes down ridiculously smooth and creamy. Finishes with a strong and unpleasant dryness. A mild and welcoming alcoholic warmth can be felt as it travels down the throat.
NOTE: What it lack in coffee compared to its normal conterpart, it makes up for with its massive syrup profile. Beers like this one is why these guys are my favorite out of the State of Florida. 1,368 charactersMyotus, Jun 14, 2016

Thanks to IckyT2012 for sending this one over in a trade.
A: Pours an opaque black, 1 fingers width of mocha colored head which has good retention before dissipating down.  Leaves almost no lacing.  4.5
S: Aroma is huge coffee, fairly large chocolate and cinnamon, maple is present initially subtle but grows as it warms and is quite nice.  I don’t really get bacon, per se, but a very subtle saltiness.  Smell is very similar to regular MBCP except fuller and a bit more roasty. Just spectacular.  4.75
T: Lactose-like cream, coffee, roasted malt, some saltiness on the finish.  Maple is present but it is subtle.  Oaky, herbaceous notes.  Coffee is pretty huge.  Subtle cinnamon.  Breakfast in a glass indeed.  4.5
M/D: Mouthfeel is smooth, somewhat velvety but in a strange mouth-coating kind of way.  ABV is exceptionally well masked.  Drinkability is very good.  4.25
O: Excellent beer.  Pretty on par with MBCP, a bit richer though (in a good way) and more roasty, with a fuller mouth feel.  I still prefer the Last Snow series, but its an exceptional beer and I am glad I was able to try it.  4.5 1,155 characterszac16125, Jun 01, 2016

Smell - WOW! Maple for days. Smoke, coffee and chocolate are all major players in the aroma as well. 
Taste - Follows the nose perfectly. This is a maple bomb. Coffee, sweet chocolate, smoke/ash. Tastes wonderful 
Feel - Nothing overly impressive about the mouthfeel. Absolutely no hint of the 10.5% though which is insane. 
Overall - Sweet, decadent dessert beer. Phenomenal. 402 charactersTonyjenlasc, May 31, 2016

Despite this, it hides the booze well for a 10.5% imperial porter. The aroma is definitely maple forward and plenty of it stands out in the flavor. The coffee is a little aggressive and kind of takes away from the smoothness of this beer. Additionally, where is the bacon? 357 charactersSheppard, May 30, 2016

It pours a pretty deep dark black, with a small head, and no lacing.
It smells like tons of maple, a bit of ashy smoke, pretty subtle coffee, and sweet chocolate. Like usual, Funky Buddha's flavored beers smell like everything they say is in there.
This is a wonderfully amped up version of MBCP. There's a ton of authentic(ish) maple flavor, sweet and syrupy, with a  bit of wispy smoke. It's not really bacon-like, it's more like cigarette smoke, with coffee way in the background. There's some chocolate, and just a small hint of roastiness. This is pretty ridiculous, and really fun to drink.
This is medium bodied, rich and creamy, with a slightly syrupy mouthfeel, and a lower level of carbonation.
This is frighteningly easy to drink for the ABV and intensity- I could drink a lot of this, and I'd get in a lot of trouble. 880 charactersGreesyFizeek, May 29, 2016

4.11/5  rDev -9.1%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4It's hard not to compare this beer to Maple Bacon Coffee Porter since this is the imperial version of MBCP. The look and smell are very much the same as MBCP with a nice dark color with a thin head of tan foam. The intense coffee and maple aromas are the best part of this beer. The taste is basically a boozy MBCP with a little less balance when it comes to the sweetness of the maple balancing the bitterness of the hops. It just doesn't work as well as it's lower abv version. The mouthfeel is also a little too thin for an imperial stout. Overall, it's still a very good beer, just not up to the challenge of outdoing the original maple bacon. 647 charactersELS, May 25, 2016

Overall black pour with a slight red hue held in the light, still noticeably thicker than last snow (the only other big beer I've had from FB). Excellent retention around the glass, tight khaki colored bubbles that dissipate quickly to a ring. 
Smell is something else. Soon as I cracked the bottle you get a whiff of maple syrup. Freshly brewed coffee follows the maple syrup with hints of dark roast malts. I get a very subtle hit of bacon in the nose, but it's well hidden under the sweetness. Overall rich, smells like a coffee shop.
Taste follows the nose well, heavy maple syrup and coffee. I understand why people review this as too sweet. Definitely maple syrup pretty much dominates, and hides any bacon or smoky profile I got in the nose. Impressive either way, as the coffee and roasted malts compliment the maple syrup very well.
Mouthfeel is creamy and velvety. Definitely a sipper, great dessert beer. 959 charactersMateo2699, May 14, 2016

The nose is BACON/COFFEE/MAPLE SYRUP/PANCAKES all in one.  It is strong enough to be smelled from across the room.  The taste is almost exactly the same as the aroma.

Smell: Pure maple syrup, the maple dominates. Slight coffee and dark malts. I get almost no bacon smokiness, if you didn't tell me it was there I would more then likely not pick it up.
T: Maple syrup dominates. This is my biggest issue with this beer, I want more coffee and  smokiness to balance out the sweetness. I also feel like the Maple syrup tastes a bit like artificial maple flavor. It's not bad by any means, I just want some coffee and bacon as advertised to calm the sweetness down.
M: medium bodied, a bit thin for an imperial Porter. 
O: A good beer, and I enjoy it much more then regular MBCP. A bit sweet and artificial maple but still a good beer worth trying. I wouldn't turn down a glass or bottle for sure, but I would definitely split the bottle. 883 charactersjloomis, May 10, 2016

4.47/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5650ml bottle, poured into a Funky Buddha oversized brandy snifter glass. Enjoyed on 5.5.2016, reviewed from Tasting Journal.
The beer pours a jet black color, thick and opaque, very viscous with a finger or so of khaki head that has good retention and offers some spotted lace. The aroma is great, roasted coffee and salty bacon leap out of the glass but are balanced really well by maple syrup and bittersweet dark chocolate that's very rich and decadent while a touch of dark and smooth grains and vanilla sweetness lingers well. The flavors just pop, booming chocolate and maple syrup, sweet, rich, smooth, decadent while the coffee plays nicely to develop some roasty and charred flavors that bring out the grain bill and the slightly salty bacon aspect to the beer really rounds this out. A touch of vanilla sweetness and even some stone fruits make their way out as the beer warms and opens up giving this beer tons of complexity and while the adjuncts are done so well, there is more to this beer and it's not just a gimmick. The mouthfeel is excellent, silky, coating, super smooth with a big, thick, full body that finishes warmly though a bit dry.
Verdict: A great imperial stout/porter from Funky Buddha, loads going on, very complex and balanced very well. This made for a great dessert beer and at no point was this too big or too cloying, was easy to enjoy a very large pour. Definitely a beer I'd go back for. 1,426 characterskevanb, May 07, 2016

Tons of maple syrup and coffee/espresso comes through on the smell. First sip I'm instantly hit with maple syrup and coffee with a little bit of a smoky/salty aftertaste. Smooth feel reminds me of their Last Snow porter. Essentially this is very similar to the Maple Bacon Coffee Porter but the increased ABV is noticeable with each sip but it's nothing too overpowering and the beer does a good job of masking the 9.5% 535 charactersxtaylorm, Apr 26, 2016

Smells awesome. Lots of maple and espresso. It hits you in the face as soon as you pop the bottle open. 
Taste is pretty much the same as MBCP version. The maple really comes thru with the coffee. not really getting any bacon or smoke. You can taste the alcohol a bit more. But still hides it well. Very easy to drink.
Feels smooth and creamy. 
Overall this is a solid brew. This is the first time I've had it. I can't wait to try the barrel aged version of this. This is a must try for any coffee stouts/ porter lovers!!!! 592 charactersLMO1190, Apr 26, 2016

The maple which is usually hard to capture in beer compliments the other flavors nicely. You get hints of maple and coffee on both the nose and pallet. But somewhere all around you get the taste of bacon which plays so nicely with all the other flavors to not be overbearing.

Appealing jet black look with basically no head.
Smell is coffee and maple, an excellent combination.
It develops a lot as it warms to room temperature. Chocolate, malt, and lots of maple syrup. Any bacon influence is subtle, which I enjoy. The presence of the bourbon is discernible, but it's behind the other flavors.
Mouthfeel is full bodied and coats the tongue. It skirts the line of being cloying but ultimately backs away from that ledge.
Glad to finally try this one! 522 charactersBsquirrelbrewer, Aug 22, 2015

Black pour, with a rich tan head. Everything in MBCP's aroma was here as well. Smooth coffee, cocoa, hints of smoke and maple--not quite as much maple as in those OG bottles, but oh well, this was still tantalizing. Smooth cold-press coffee in the taste, dark chocolate, dark malts, sugary maple sensation somewhat subtle and/or muddled in the mix, hints of smoke in the background. About the same as MBCP overall...and that goes for the booziness too. Imperial as it may be, the drinkability is just as easy-going, and it sure doesn't feel like 10.5%. 580 charactersRifugium, Jun 05, 2015

Yet somehow, it's not too sweet.  The balance between the maple, smokey bacon, and coffee is perfect.  No other stout like this has even come close to the kind of balance they achieved.   This is deservedly one of the all time greats 407 charactersSatchboogie, Mar 20, 2015

5/5  rDev +10.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Drank on tap at Olde Magoun's Saloon, Somerville, MA
Served in a snifter
Near pitch black appearance. The ultra viscous, oily liquid was topped by a one-finger tall, super tight and frothy, saddle brown crown. Outstanding retention. The head slowly dropped to a lasting cap of foam and deposited copious amounts of streaky lacing along the glass.
The aroma was outstanding and could be detected several feet from the glass. Maple notes were in full effect. Warm maple syrup drizzled pancakes came to mind. Loads of brown sugar and caramel. Intense vanilla bean. Slightly roasty. Freshly brewed coffee was noticeable as well. Hint of dark chocolate.
Like the nose, the flavor profile was spectacular. Once again, maple notes dominated. Super sweet but not cloyingly so. Ultra rich and robust. Boatloads of dark malts and brown sugar notes. Dark roast coffee came through strong in the center. The beer was moderately roasty on the back end and the finish. Coffee grounds were noticeable. A touch of piney hops appeared as well.
The mouthfeel was ridiculously creamy and viscous. Almost milk shake-like. The liquid contained a super fine, moderate effervescence that helped the beer glide across my palate.
Funky Buddha makes a number of insanely flavorful and creative beers, but Wide Awake It's Morning definitely takes the prize. Although I got no bacon in either the nose or the flavor profile, this beer was still mesmerizing. Furthermore, at nearly 11% ABV, it drank like a dream. As far as breakfast stouts go, this one simply cannot be beat. 1,552 charactersDamian, Mar 20, 2015

4.48/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5From notes. Poured from a 22 oz. bottle into a snifter. This bottle is about a year old.
Wide Awake pours a dark brown mahogany color with almost no head formation on the initial pour.
The aroma still jumps out of the glass. Bursts of espresso, sweet maple syrup, smoke, and vanilla all come through. With the age of the bottle I would not be surprised if the coffee smelled even better fresh, but it still smells incredible. Each whiff unveils a little bit more complexity. This is definitely a winner.
The flavor is huge. There coffee flavor manifests itself in the beginning of the sip, with what seems to be a few different types of exquisite espresso. Sweetness runs rampant with maple syrup flavors coming through during each part of the sip, with a little bit of vanilla as well. A thorough smoked malt flavor comes through representing the bacon. There is no concern of it being too smokey, a fear I often have with beers that use smoked malts. What is truly amazing is how each sip provides a new angle on the combination of coffee, maple syrup, and smoke. Each flavor develops more thoroughly with each sip, making this a glass that never gets boring.
Each sip is truly a full bodied treat. It is so thick and viscous, with a light and creamy carbonation. It is definitely sweet, sticky, and syrupy, and more than a little over the top.
This beer impressed me even more than the Maple Bacon Coffee Porter, which is saying something. I would love to have a fresh bottle to compare. 1,495 charactersKickInTheChalice, Jul 02, 2013

When I asked what was being released next the bartender said, well tomorrow we'll be doing maple bacon coffee porter. I was ecstatic, except he was wrong. Instead it was imperial mbcp, wide awake.
Served in 8oz portion in a snifter. Pours a deep dark, jet black with A plentiful brown head. Smell is ridiculous, overwhelming coffee, coffee, for days with rich malts and chocolate following. Taste is smooth malty coffee with no bite, it oozes down the throat. as it warms the maple becomes apparent, with little bacon to speak of. after the first sip, the taste lingers and candied bacon flavors are throughout my mouth. Mouthfeel is not syrupy or thick, but medium to full, a crazily drinkable 10.5 abv.
Overall this is like Christmas morning for adults. Funky Buddha is on track to do big big things when they go into full scale production in 2013 913 characterstravisdiener32, Nov 09, 2012

3.97/5  rDev -12.2%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4On-tap at the Funky Buddha's 2nd Anniversary Party. Poured into an FB snifter.
Appearance - Black without being inky. Small khaki head. Wispy and a little sticky.
Smell - Intense coffee without ever being acidic. It rounds itself out with a touch of maple and some smokiness that mellows the coffee into an earthiness that is quite pleasant. A little over the top at first, but the full nose is quite nice.
Taste - Like the nose, the coffee is intense and almost astringent. The acidity of it is just a little too much at first. The roasted malts mellow it, surprisingly, and give it a nice touch of smoke in the end. The maple is barely a hint, if I can even detect it at all. It just seems to be there as something that keeps it drinkably sweet at such a high ABV and coffee content.
Mouthfeel - The coffee intense and maybe a little too intense. The rest of the beer drinks nicely, especially for 11.5%, which is how FB listed it on the board. Medium bodied. Nicely balanced except for the coffee.
Overall - A really nice beer without being exceptional in any way. The way the coffee character blends with the smoked malts is its best characteristic. 1,158 charactersAlieniloquium, Sep 30, 2012

Pours a clouded nutty brown color with a crop of tanned head on top. Retains nicely on top of the pour, leaving patches of lacing behind. 
Powerful, aromatic nose with rich maple syrup, chocolate and touches of smoke. Coffee beans and roasty malts with a touch of booze and sweetness.
Rich and smooth up front with coffee and maple syrup. Heavy malt backbone followed by edges of smoke and bacon-like flavors. Some vanilla tones with chocolate. Nutty and roasty with some alcohol warmth. 
Full bodied, milder carbonation, insanely creamy and soft on the tongue. This one just lives up to the hype, there's no two ways about it. 645 charactersxnicknj, Feb 11, 2012

Appearance: Pours a dark brown with a layer of thick, smooth tan head thad fades to a ring around the edge of the glass and leaves some lacing.
Smell: This beer is more roast forward than the Morning Wood. Still some sweet maple, but this one is milder. I'm picking up some smooth, nutty coffee.
Taste: I can pick up a hint of bacon in this beer, it's a very welcome flavor. The maple is a bit more subdued than the barrel aged version. Roasty and sweet with a nice amount of maple blending with everything else.
Mouthfeel: Thick body with smooth carbonation and a dry finish.
Overall: I enjoyed this slightly more than the barrel aged version. This one seems to allow the bacon to show up and not just highlight the maple and coffee. I would love to have another. 819 charactersoline73, Feb 10, 2012

t - Tastes of coffee, smokey malts, roasted malts, brown sugar, sweet dark fruits, chocolate, toasted malts, and vanilla. A tiny bit more smoke then the nose.
m - Medium to full body and low carbonation. Thick body, very nice.
o - Overall a really great beer, though not as good as the BA version (Morning Wood). This vversion is smokier, and not quite as smooth. Still great and worth checking out. 704 charactersmdfb79, Feb 10, 2012

Very dark pretty much pitch black, slightest hints of light on the corners, light creamy head.
Nose fresh espresso, roasted coffee, light maple, hint smoke, chalky cocoa, dark malts.
Taste chocolate, fresh espresso brewed coffee, dark choc, creamy oats, light maple, slight hint of smoked bacon like, a bit of caramel and toffee, some bitterness from light earthy hops and the roasted malts, just the slightest hint of booze. Finish is long and a bit more bitter but not very bitter at all, tons more espresso and chocolate.
Mouth is rich and a bit creamy, full bodied, decent carb.
Overall wow, this beer is awesome. I really wish we could get it up here in MA. 679 charactersjlindros, Feb 07, 2012

The smell of the beer was very sweet, rich and slightly smokey. The taste of the beer was sweet, roasted, maple and caramel flavors with some wood and smoke along with vanilla and coffee. An absolute cluster of flavors in this brew. The mouthfeel was heavy and had a medium carbonation to it. Overall this was special for sure. I would love to have more of this someday. I've found myself craving more Funky Buddha since the EBF ended. Looks like I may be going to Florida sometime in the near future. 598 charactersKnapp85, Feb 07, 2012

Pours a black-as-night color with a small dark brown head that is fine and just clings everywhere in your glass. Nose is still utterly amazing for a coffee lover like me, the coffee is slightly more pronounced and less mellow but still amazing.
Taste follows the nose, more coffee, a bit more acidic but then again coffee is acidic so no real surprise. Maple is still present and delicious. Overall this is an awesome candidate for barrel aging but it's nearly as good off steel. 645 characterskingcrowing, Feb 05, 2012

A: Pours a big syrupy black color with a small khaki colored head. Retention isn't great, but with a high ABV it still looks evil
S: Damn, tons of sweet maple, coffee, and some burnt bacon. Simply amazing. The maple adds a whole new dimension to this beer that I never thought was possible
T: Much more balanced and refined that I expected. The bacon is less noticeable in the flavor, but the maple adds a pleasant flavor and balances the dark roast coffee. Thick body and dangerously drinkable. Not too much hop presence, but then again, that's not what you would want in a beer like this.
MF: Thick and chewy feel to it, sweet maple/coffee finish, low-medium carbonation. Alcohol is not detectable. 
O: Overall, this is an amazing beer worthy of its hype. I have not had but one chance to get to FB since I am at school in SC since they have become a world-class brewery, but I will definitely make the effort now. Great job Funky Buddha! 1,012 charactersscottyshades, Jan 16, 2012

Bottle #27
Pours very dark, with a viscous, dark tan half-finger head that dissipates after 30 seconds or so.
This is easily among the best smelling beers I've encountered. Not to take away from the beer in any way, but the only way to describe it is like a McGriddle in a glass. It's amazing. My girlfriend commented when she came home (while we were drinking this) and said the whole house smelled great, like a pancake house. I'd give this 6/5 if I could.
Taste gets a 4.5 only because it doesn't match how great it smelled. The maple is there in force along with the coffee and a twinge of bacon at the end. Very delicious, but just not as well-harmonized as I'd like. 
Mouthfeel is nice, low carbonation, low heat (especially considering the abv) and nice and dry. 
Overall this was the most interesting beer of the night, and of recent memory. Extremely grateful for the opportunity to taste it and can only hope that it becomes less impossible to have in the future. 1,029 charactersmyspoonistoobig, Jan 13, 2012

Pours black without any head, even with a vigorous pour. 
Wow, smells incredible. Huge maple syrup, and dark roast coffee with smokiness. My tasting partner notes offal/bacon. A little chocolate, cream, a touch of fruit/jam, and roasted malts. The aroma filled the room once I opened it. Unbelievable stuff.
Tastes of sweet maple combined with chocolate and a ton of dark roast coffee. Light bacon smoke as well. The first taste was very sweet, but the more I sip it the less sweet it is, and definitely not as sweet as the aroma suggests. Really delicious and drinkable. Alcohol is well hidden, leaves my mouth dry.
Medium to full body with moderate carbonation for the style. Doesn't make it feel too syrupy, smooth mouthfeel. 
Overall, very impressive beer. So much complexity to the nose and taste. I was worried I held onto it too long and the flavors would fade, but they are still going strong. 937 charactersislandboi8204, Dec 19, 2011

Bottle to snifter.
Bottle 29/50
From notes. Shared at the DL Variant + Others Tasting in Chicago back in October. Thanks to dimenhetfield for the trade. 
A: Deep chocolate brown. Barely 0.5 fingernail (tan) head on vigorous pour. 
S: Initially, I cannot decide if I like this or hate it. Obviously it would be unfair to judge a beer on smell alone; however, this is quite unique...smokey, maple syrup, espresso, dark chocolate, brown sugar, and pancakes. Just kidding – there were no pancakes on the nose of this beer, but that’s what it makes me think of...a big burly breakfast. I cannot find the bacon in the smell, but am hopeful that comes later.
T: Complex. Very complex. Sweet and roasty. Rich. Up-front you get strong coffee notes intertwined with sweet malt and maple syrup. Bacon comes thru solo (mid-palate) and this is quite an interesting flavor for the beer. Finished off with a hint of caramel and vanilla which I thought was nice.
M: Full bodied and almost no carbonation. Potent after-taste that almost ruined the experience for me, but I can look past it.
O: This was a very unique beer to have at such a large tasting. Initially, I thought the beer might be off based on reactions from the crowd; however, once I "jumped into the beer", it was just really, really complex. The complexity actually amazes me; however, IMO it almost takes away from the actual point of the beer. Obviously there is a fine line between good and bad, but this one tip-toes the hanging wire. I had fun with this one though and tried to enjoy the experience as much as possible. As mentioned above, I would to take down a huge plate of breakfast with this beer. It is bold and big (a lot going on), but nothing that I would seek out going forward. Curious to see how the regular Maple Bacon Coffee Porter tastes in comparison to this, but my interest stops there.
Simply put...fun to try! 1,907 charactersspdyfire83, Dec 05, 2011

1.54/5  rDev -65.9%look: 3 | smell: 1.5 | taste: 1 | feel: 3 |  overall: 1.5Big thanks to spdyfire83 for bringing this to the table! 22oz bottle poured into a tulip...
Appearance: pours a dark, opaque brown. The thin head is gone quick. Virtually no lacing. Carbonation is fitting for a porter (this is a porter, right?!). 
Aroma: This bottle had been cracked and was being passed around when I came back from a glass rinse...the maple had already infiltrated the entire room upon my return. I like maple, so now I'm excited! But then I get my pour, and the game changes dramatically. Despite the fact that I can still smell maple in the room, I get virtually none when I really get into my pour. I get the coffee and some smoke, but what dominates is this weird fucking vegetable smell. I've read reviews mentioning this but I'd never experienced it, so I just thought al those reviewers were daft. But here it is, and it overwhelmed the beer. Cooked celery, and maybe some bell pepper (?) were my associations. Seriously, the smell killed my beer boner most heinously.
Taste: Wow...gross. Acrid cheap coffee, some smoke characteristics. Overwhelmingly bitter. I only taste maple when I exhale after a sip. And then it gets worse...the aftertaste is unholy and punishing - it just doesn't stop sucking, it's amazing! It tastes like raw celery, and it lingers longer than a vegan fart. 
Mouthfeel: Carbonation and body are appropriate for the style, but it's past the point of mattering. 
Overall: I'm excited I had a chance to try this one, and I respect what the brewers are going for...but my experience with it was disappointing and unpleasant. 1,577 charactersexitmusic00, Oct 30, 2011
4.87/5  rDev +7.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5BIG THANKS To darkguardian for this one!!!22oz bomber bottle number 6 of 50. I was torn whether or not to open this bad boy right away or to sit on it for a special occasion. After some comments I decided to open it last night. Man am I glad I did. The second I opened the bottle the maple syrup and coffee smell filled the room. I was a little worried after all the hype that I was gonna get a bad bottle but the inital smell is all good. I poured it into a darkness snifter and it poured black with some brown head that went away very fast. The smell is of roasted coffee and maple with some smokeyness. The taste is great alot smoother than I thought it was gonna be it's like breakfast in a beer. Mouthfeel could be a little thicker in my opinion(if you wanna split hairs). This beer was a little bittersweet because it was such an amazing beer and I wish I could have share it with someone, but I'm also happy I got the whole bottle to myself (minus a couple sips for my wife). After all was said and done my hands still reeked of maple syrup and my wife said my breath stank of dark coffee. ALL AROUND AN AMAZING BEER!!!! TOTALLY LIVED UP TO THE HYPE!!! 1,159 charactersbobbypaulson, Oct 30, 2011

Big thanks for hooking me up with this want. The label says -3/50.
A: Black with a finger of light brown foam. Decent retention. 
S: Huge maple and black coffee aroma with a light bacon smokiness. There's a little chocolate and earth, as well as moderately roasted malt. Exceptional nose. The maple is really great. An imperial breakfast in a glass.
T: Sweet maple blends with chocolate and a robust earthy coffee profile. Light bacon smoke and moderately roasted malt. Not as sweet as the aroma suggests, and not as sweet as MBCP. Really nice. Alcohol is really well hidden, I wouldn't guess this is over 6%.
M: Full body with upper moderate carbonation. The mouthfeel sticky and smooth.
Overall: Impressive stuff. More drinkable than the Maple Bacon Coffee Porter. Perhaps that's the age mellowing out the maple. 831 charactersHopHead84, Oct 24, 2011

A- Pours a dark brown with a thin head that dissipates into a thin cap. No lacing left behind.
S- Wow really intense bacon, vegetables..perhaps bell peppers? maple syrup, coffee grounds, dark chocolate, tobacco, roasted malt and some smokiness. 
T- Meaty with bacon and sausage, sweet maple syrup, burnt caramel, old coffee grounds, tobacco, chocolate, roasted and smoked malt.
M- Medium carbonation and body. Finishes dry and bitter with some coffee grounds. The abv is hidden well.
O- This was just an intense beer with too much going on. Lot's of burnt coffee and smoke that reminded me of drinking cheap coffee at a diner. Overall, I admire their creativity, but I just don't think it was executed well. 815 charactersiadler, Oct 11, 2011

S: Absolutely intense aroma of the exact ingredients listed in the name. The intensity of the aroma is almost unbelievable. Huge scents of sweet maple syrup, strong coffee, smoky bacon, and some lighter chocolate notes, all fighting for supremacy in my nose. 
T: Tastes of chocolate and coffee with smoke in the background. Long lingering flavor of burnt coffee. Burnt caramel on the finish, but then comes along a light maple sweetness. 
M: Medium bodied with light carbonation. Sweet with a smoky tannic ashtray bitterness. 
O: It's rare that a beer makes me ask the age old question: WTF?, but this oddity did. It's certainly a unique beer that tastes and smells exactly as advertised on the label. Like breakfast in a blender. And while I do enjoy maple, bacon, and coffee, I'm not 100% convinced they all need to make an appearance in my beer to be appreciated. 927 charactersFlorida9, Oct 11, 2011

This one pours a near lifeless black, medium I'm body. Right off the bat you get hit in the face with aromas of maple syrup pancakes, smoked sausage, coffee, vanilla, and sweet chocolates. Crazy nose and very strong. You can smell it from ten feet away. The flavors are a nice mix of maple syrup drenched breakfast sausages, chocolate, vanilla beans, and light coffee. While very good, I may soon be Diabetic. The sugar is out of this world. It's drinkable but only at maybe half a bottle at a time. I can't take that much sugar. Very nice beer though and definitely unique. To think that a beer can accomplish such a complex nose is mind boggling. Great beer and excellent beer to tick. 779 charactersaasher, Sep 25, 2011

S: Maple syrup and burnt coffee. A bit of smoke and roast. Not particularly inviting or well developed.
T: Like the nose, coffee (both roasted and burnt) takes center stage. A bit of smoked malts, maple syrup, brown sugar, and chocolate.
M: Fairly thin for as much malt in the flavor. A weak, sloppy finish. Slightly over carbonated.
O: Eh, I just didn't get the appeal of this. I didn't get any bacon... and the smoke and coffee was rather boring. Give me Mikkeller's beer geek bacon anyday. 594 characterscallmemickey, Sep 09, 2011

This beer smells just as good as any beer I've ever had. Coffee beans, bacon and slight notes of smoke. It immediately makes me crave pancakes. Just incredible.
I get a ton of maple in the taste. There is also plenty of black coffee but the bacon takes a back seat. Perhaps a little on the back end. All of the ingredients are in concert. Medium body with low, albeit, perfect carbonation.
The beer was quite impressive. It was a perfect choice for the first hints of Autumn and would love the opportunity to revisit in the future. 619 charactersrudylaw, Sep 07, 2011

Black color. Ring of light mocha head with moderate retention. Spotty and sparse lace with very little cling. 
Big coffee notes with some Chinese medicinal notes in the background. Some slight hints of maple in the background. No bacon. Strange. Very aromatic though. 
Maple opening. Coffee notes towards the middle with chocolate and fudge. Bacon comes in sweet. More maple and coffee with some milky notes. Finish is sweet and slightly smoky. Aftertaste is more smoke and coffee bean bitterness. Not bad, but not great either. 
Medium to full bodied and near flat. Smooth and oily in the mouth and smooth and viscous going down. Finish is messy with a lingering aftertaste. Good. 
This is pretty much a novelty beer in my opinion. Very different than anything else I’ve ever had from the style but that doesn’t mean that it’s particularly good. After about the 3rd or 4th ounce, my palate had had enough. Decent, but forgettable. 1,042 charactersSpeedwayJim, Sep 05, 2011

Bottle 47/50
The most striking thing about this beer to me is the smell. Biggest nose on a beer to date. As soon as you open it the smell is unmistakeable. Breakfast sausage and maple syrup. Just like a sunday morning breakfast cookout. Even two feet away in my glass the heavy pounding of my olfactory nerves persists. Incredibly potent. And downright fuckin wonderful.
Thick used motor oil in a glass! No head whatsoever. The glass is stained wherever the liquid touches.
Taste is coffee, pork and syrup. Incredible. It's not too thick or chewy. It may sound awful but in truth it is possibly the best beer I've ever had.
In my eyes, a once in a lifetime beer. I felt like I had won the taste lottery. Hype is my kryptonite. I bought into this hype train hook, line and sinker. Good thing I did. This beer is ultimate win. 862 charactersTheDudeRules, Aug 13, 2011
4.15/5  rDev -8.2%look: 2.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4So glad to try this, courtesy of Urbancaver (thanks Cam!). Bottle 50/50. This pours with almost no head, just a dark brown and opaque liquid. The smell is strong with maple syrup, good coffee aroma behind that. Actually the aroma is a little overwhelming and very enticing. No bacon in the aroma, too bad as that was a strong point in the non imperial version.
This tastes pretty strong and rich, really sweet upfront and a little cloying in the aftertaste. I'm not gonna say it tastes bad, because it's actually tasty for the most part, but this pales in comparison to Maple Bacon Coffee Porter. Norm actually poured the majority of his out while I watched in amazement, I guess that's a good indication that it gets a bit tiring.
Thickish mouthful, intense in every metric, but again I'd rather have the original. 817 charactersTurdFurgison, Aug 13, 2011

Pours a dark dark brown with a reddish tint. A tiny bit of tan head. Looks great. Before i can even finish looking the aroma hits strongly. Huuuge coffee and maple on the nose before i even put my nose near the glass. Incredible. Tastes coffee heavy with a wonderful maple prescence. It's a bit heavier and overpowering.

Massive thanks goes out to beeruser for sharing this one with me and also my boy Jefe73 for sending me one of these as a surprise on my birthday! Bottle #44 of 50! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller flute. Poured pitch black with a half finger light tan head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, cofee, maple syrup, subtle smoke, and caramel. The flavor was of sweet malt, coffee, brown sugar, maple syrup, slight smoke, and subtle meat. It had a heavy feel on the palate with mild carbonation (almost a creamy texture). Overall this brew was nothing short of phenomenal. Now this is what I am talking about! I really wish they made a cologne out of this brew as I would wear it daily. The aroma on this thing is phenomenal and really robust as you can smell it from a completely different room (seriously!). The flavor, just like the aroma. The smokiness on this one added a REALLY nice aspect to the already stellar brew. The alcohol? Nowhere to be found... I hate this was such a small batch as I could eat/drink this for breakfast every morning. Just a great brew. 1,175 charactersthagr81us, Jul 22, 2011

Pours very dark with a very very slight head. Immediately the aromas hit you maple, coffee, some smokiness. The taste is rich and luxurious with slightly sweet flavors resembling the aromas, coffee, maple, smoky bacon. Absolutely delicious. The mouthfeel is amazing, it coats your mouth in velvety richness. I could literally find nothing wrong with this beer. I wish there were 10,000 bottles.
Also, I didn't knock off as others have done for lack of head in appearance as I think this adds to the "coffee" persona. To each his own. 569 charactersDeadheadbill, Jul 20, 2011

A - Pours coffee black with a thin tan head. Not much in the way of lacing on this one.
S - There's the smoke I was looking for in the regular Maple Bacon Coffee Porter. This one definitely smells like breakfast is being made in the kitchen and is stirring you out of bed. Big notes of espresso, sugar, sweet maple syrup and a hint of chocolate.
T - The taste mirrors the nose and the smokiness / bacon profile is much improved in the Imperial version. Upfront you're again hit right away by notes of roasted coffee, sweet malt, maple syrup and maybe a little vanilla. 
M - Full bodied, almost chewy with low carbonation. Perfectly balanced in every way. No alcohol heat is present in this one either.
O - This is an extremely rich beer and it would be difficult to throw this back all night long, I did enjoy about three before calling it quits. Kevin and Ryan did a great job of taking an already superior beer and improving on it. Cheers! 1,085 charactersJefe73, Jul 15, 2011

4.26/5  rDev -5.8%look: 3 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Bottle #30/50, thanks Jason! Poured into Darkness snifter.
A - Pours like a cold black coffee. No head, lace, or retention.
S - Holy Moses! Tons of black coffee, coffee grinds, coffee beans, and sweet maple syrup. These notes dominate just about everything else...even the alcohol, as there's really no trace. That said, these two notes are delicious, so I really enjoyed sniffing this one over and over.
T - Huge sweetness, huge coffee, huge maple. Like an iced coffee with extra chocolate, alcohol hidden well. If you threw some ice into this and served it in a Starbucks cup, I'd have a hard time believing this was beer! Bitter black coffee finish with a slight touch of maple sweetness.
M - Full body, ultra rich, no carbonation, creamy finish. 3.5 
O - My pour was good enough and I didn't really have the desire to keep drinking this one. Kinda like Black Tuesday and Chocolate Rain. That said, this beer has a wonderful nose and tastes excellent. It's as-advertised, a coffee/maple beer that is incredibly decadent. 1,028 charactersSean9689, Jul 12, 2011
4.56/5  rDev +0.9%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Bottle #30 of 50. Generously shared by Jason via Casey. Served in a Jester King tulip.
A - Quick-dissolving off-white foam settles to a thin ring, some wisps on top, and leaves a few spots of lace. Black body, with only the slightest hint of brown at the fringes when held to the light.
S - Tons of maple, some dark roast coffee, perhaps a hint of roasted malt. If you're looking for subtlety look elsewhere. If you're looking for delicious, this is your exit.
T - Tastes like an iced coffee with a hefty dose of maple syrup poured into it. Is there actually any beer here? I can't taste any alcohol either. Still, it's quite sweet and I'd definitely have to sip this one.
M - Chewy, full bodied, with some roasty dryness, lower carbonation, and minimal alcohol warmth. While some person though the porter was too thin, I don't anticipate similar complaints here.
D - It'd be hard to put down a whole bottle of this one, as it's extremely rich. However, it's a delicious and highly enjoyable beverage that I'd very much like to have again. Less coffee than the lower ABV porter version, and more maple. 1,107 charactersMasterSki, Jul 10, 2011
4.46/5  rDev -1.3%look: 3 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Thanks to Jason and Casey for bringing this to Chicago.
A - Blackish-dark brown beer with not much of a head and nothing left on the sides.
S - Tons of maple syrup and tons of coffee. It smells like pure maple syrup. There might be a slight bit of smokey malt in there, but it is buried by what seems to be a bottle of maple syrup that was dumped into this beer. The smell is so strong it pretty much knocks you over. That said, it's good.
T - Super sweet maple syrup and some rich coffee. Sweetness, and bitter roasted coffee. Great morning drink, or great breakfast drink. Really have never had anything like this with quite this distinctive maple syrup taste. It's rich, and the coffee is rich. It's so sweet though, really couldn't drink tons of it.
M - Feels pretty full bodied, with low carbonation.
O - Great beer, although it's a real sipper and good to share amongst friends. Like other Funky Buddha beers I've had, it's really unique and this one I really recommend. 981 charactersAgentZero, Jul 10, 2011
4.48/5  rDev -0.9%look: 3 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to Jason thru Casey for this. Bottle #30 of 50. A dark brown/black color with no lacing. The smell is exceptional....immediate coffee and maple, chocolate, and faint pepper tones. The taste is in your face with coffee, tobacco, leather, sweet and spicy. Light mouthfeel with surprisingly light carbonation that is unexpected from the look. This is a good beer that's to be shared. It's a sipper and a beer that is worth seeking out. I would love to taste this again in 1 to 2 years to see how it ages in the cellar. Very good quaff. 539 charactersspycow, Jul 10, 2011
4.51/5  rDev -0.2%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Bottle 30/50...Big thanks to Casey for this... dark brown body with not much carbonation... the nose is outstanding, so much is going on, super strong notes of maple and roasted coffee, they play perfectly off each other... the taste is more refined than the nose, simply outstanding melding of maple and coffee, a bit of molasses, the maple is so sweet but the roasted bitterness of the coffee balances... I could drink about a half bottle of this, but would get too sweet after awhile... worth trying 502 charactersjrallen34, Jul 10, 2011
4.77/5  rDev +5.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Very excited to try this beer. Can it live up to the hype?
Pours coffee black with thin tan foam that leaves a glossy surface reminiscent of obsidian rock
This smell is what I want to wake up to every morning. First the maple, next the hint of smoke (bacon) and finally the smell of freshly brewed coffee. Absolutely sublime. 
Taste is maple, smoke and black coffee. Really is extraordinary how these flavors blend together
Mouthfeel is very nice medium bodied with just enough carbonation 
Overall this is one of the best beers I've ever had, no question. Definitely live up to the hype actually it may even exceeds it! 625 characterskfsv034, Jun 29, 2011
4.54/5  rDev +0.4%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Tasted at the GRAND OPENING of the Funky Buddha Homebrew Store (located directly next door to the Brewery) and the release of their Imperial Maple Bacon Coffee Porter.
10 oz pour from the tap into my Bon Beer Voyage snifter member Funky Buddha Lounge & Brewery snifter glass. 
A: This beer pours a dark brown, almost black with a very thin layer of beige foam, leaving no lacing on my glass. 
S: The nose was what you would expect from the name, roasted coffee, maple and hints of smoked bacon. 
T: The taste was a little more intense than the nose, with the roasted coffee and the maple sharing equally as the stars of this brew and the smoked bacon playing second fiddle. This beer was very well balanced with it not being too sweet, which you might have expected from the maple.
M: This beer had a medium to thick mouthfeel with an extremely low level of carbonation; it finished with a very pleasant slickness on the palate and a nice warmth from the alcohol. 
D&O: The drinkability was excellent as it went down nice and easy for a 10.5%abv brew.
Overall, if you liked the “regular” Maple Bacon Coffee Porter, you will not want to miss this one. I liked this Imperial version better, as my palate like the balance of this one more. I hope they will be brewing this one again!! 1,292 charactersuturn, Jun 27, 2011
4.77/5  rDev +5.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5On tap at the release (06-26-2011)
Beer pours pitch Black....what a gorgeous color.
Nose gives a lot more smoke then the regular Maple Bacon Coffee Porter, which was something that I could careless about as I do not enjoy smoke. In this beer though it fits in perfectly.
This beer is a GrandSlam Breakfast (minus the eggs) in a glass. Maple Syrup is present, Smoke is there, and SLAMMM a huge hit of Black Coffee! Everything is exceptionally well balanced.
The highlight of this beer is the mouthfeel. I have complained before that I wanted more mouthfeel from some of their beers. This one is spot on. Almost velvet-y smooth. Just Perfect!
Very Good Beer! 661 charactersDosBeerigos, Jun 27, 2011
4.97/5  rDev +10%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5On tap at Funky Buddha.
Dark in color, but not entirely opaque. Has a lighter burgundy tone around the glass edge. thin film of head which disappeared soon after. Incredible nose and taste. Lots of maple and coffee on the nose. Tastes just like it smells and after warming a bit, some smoky flavors make an appearance. All balanced well. Packs a punch on ABV and it's clearly present in the taste. A definite sipper and IMO, the regular version is a bit easier drinking. Really amazing overall, FB did it again with this one. 526 characterspolisanl, Jun 27, 2011
4.89/5  rDev +8.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Had a couple glasses of this for good reason.
A: looks like a dark beer so no surprises. Didn't have much of a head which I prefer, though if they really do brew this with bacon that would explain that
S: Maple smells dominate but also coffee. Smells awesome. 
T: Taste follows the smell, strong coffee and maple flavor, but more blended together. This tastes less like liquid breakfast (good thing in my opinion). One of the more unique, and better tastes I've had in a beer.
M: This isn't the thickest syrup of stout you'll ever have, but it's well bodied and smooth. Matches the sweetness well.
O: What a beer. Wish they brewed more than a handful of gallons of this so I could find it in other parts of florida. 720 charactersgodfathermg57, Jun 27, 2011
4.59/5  rDev +1.5%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5My first trip to the buddah, and this was the first beer of the day. On-tap into a FB snifter.
A: Jet black, opaque. The pour dropped a small head that faded to nothing rather quickly and didn't leave much lace. This is where my critisim ends.
A: Maple, coffee, roast, and smoke. The maple is undeniably the star of the show, and complements the roast and smokey aromas nicely. 
T: This is simply devine. Big maple syrup, coffee beans, chocolate, and smoky bacon. The bacon flavor is not as noticable as in the original version, but it is not a knock on the beer. This imperial version packs a punch ABV wise, but you wouldn't know it, there is almost no hint of the alcohol in the taste.
M: Creamy and smooth. Full body. Small but appropriate levels of carbonation.
O: This is one of the best brews I've ever had. Smooth, flavorful, and dangerously drinkable. I wish I could've stayed all night to pound glass after glass of this stuff. Supurb! Skal. 956 charactersGtreid, Jun 27, 2011
4.75/5  rDev +5.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Been waiting for this gem of a beer for quite some time. Pours black, not too thick, but not thin either. Maple is the main ingredient that you smell first, swiftly followed by smokiness and coffee bean. A little bit more smokey then the regular Maple Bacon. The ABV is hidden very well amongst the flavors in this one. Has to be one of the best beers I've ever had. 366 charactersdimenhetfield, Jun 26, 2011
4.5/5  rDev -0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Release day at the funky Buddha and just finished my 3rd glass. It is if course delicious just like the original is. The only difference I have noticed and what makes this a 4.5 and not a 5.0 is that the nose is not as maple smelling as the original is. Not a complaint at all as I am about to go back for my 4th glass, just an honest observation. How they got the taste to be almost exactly the same with the much higher alcohol % is a mystery to me, but Kevin and Ryan at the buddha sure know what the heck they are doing when it comes to brewing a wonderful beer. Well worth the drink if u can get it, my bottle to take home has been spoken for for weeks now! 662 characterscalcio360jrd, Jun 26, 2011
4.69/5  rDev +3.8%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Big thanks to Ryan (owner/brewer) for this first ever taste out of the fermenter in the final stage of the brew!
Kind of a murky purple/burgundy with a decent tan head. Not much to look at really. That's where the negativity ends.
The smell is righteous! It's all in the name of course as well as some casual nuances and notions of syrup, roasted coffee beans, coco bacon bits, and vanilla cream.
The taste is killer as well of course! All the flavors of the nose come through even more delectably than I could've imagined. Really a tasty breakfast treat I could have ANYTIME. 
She's got a great mouth on her! No really though this is thicker than most stouts I've ever tastes. Really heavy and fluffy all together. Kind of expands inside your mouth. By far the mouthfeel is the most impressive piece of this breakfast pie.
Overall I'm head over heels for this beer! I can't wait to go through some serious trouble to get more when it's released. 961 charactersHabmike, Apr 02, 2011
