4.42/5  rDev -0.5%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.75A: The beer is close to being jet black in color, but when held up to a light the edges of the glass are clear brownish red in color.  It poured with some delicate lacing consisting of beige bubbles on the surface and a thin collar around the edge of the glass.
S: Light to moderate aromas of bourbon are present in the nose, along with associated hints of vanilla and bits of brown sugar.
T: The taste follows the smell, but there is more vanilla than bourbon along with notes of brown sugar and hints of coconut.  No alcohol is perceptible.
M: It feels full-bodied on the palate and coats your mouth to some degree with a moderate amount of carbonation.
O: While this beer masks any traces of alcohol very well from the taste, it makes for a good dessert beer or after dinner drink that you really want to take your time with so you can sip and savor the flavors.
Note: 2016 vintage (purple bowling ball)

Pours a dark brown with a small head that took some work. Minimal lacing, low carbonation. 
Sweet smell with a delicious aroma I can't place. Maybe toasted coconut (which I don't normally like) with brown sugar. Definite booziness but very smooth nonetheless. 
Sweet right at the start but chocolate, brown sugar, vanilla, spices combine with bourbon and oak. One of the more complex and wonderful tastes I've experienced. Maybe a bit on the sweet and boozy side but I love it. Gets better as it warms a bit. 
Mouthfeel is amazing. Substantial complexity with low carbonation that suits me just right.  Like the taste, it gets better as it warms. 
Overall, one of the best beers I've ever had. Definitely a bit sweet but not overdone. The sugar and bourbon alcohol mix perfectly with chocolate, spice, vanilla and cinnamon.
Can't wait to age a bottle and drink another! 903 charactersWolvmar, May 20, 2017

Aroma-  lot going on here. Chocolate, barrel,  vanilla .  Def loving smell of this one. 
Taste is super smooth.  Sweet but not cloying at all.  Drink this warmer,  taste improves
significantly at 55 degrees.  Taste follows the smell.  15 percent abv is very well hidden 
Mouthfeel is rock solid.  Medium mouthfeel that suits this beer very well. 
Bottom line I really liked this beer.  Drink it warm tho.  I like sweetness in my barrel aged stouts.  If u do u will love this beer 529 charactersjcflorian, May 20, 2017

A: Pours dark brown with excellent clarify, some ruby highlights, with a half finger of dense light brown head.  No lacing but excellent retention.
S: Sweet chocolate and toasted coconut, oak and a bit of cinnamon and vanilla, a light touch of coffee, and brown sugar.
T: So sweet and boozy.  Melted chocolate, coconut, soft cinnamon, moderate oak and spice.   
M: Fairly substantial alcohol burn.  Thick medium-full body with medium-light but sharp carbonation that cuts through.  
O: Reminds me a bit of Black Tuesday.  Pretty decent, with substantial and tasty coconut contribution, but fairly boozy at this point. 650 characterspmarlowe, May 12, 2017

I wanted so bad to enjoy this beer.  I bought into the hype, and with shipping, paid $50 for my bottle. I then eagerly waited 2 days for Friday night after dinner to put it in a glass. To say I'm disappointed is an understatement. How does this thin, sugary, boozy, mess rate so high? It's not awful, but it's far from world class. 615 charactersMJSFS, May 06, 2017

Pours motor oil black with a milk chocolate colored head. Head disappears very quickly and as I drink this down there is no lacing at all. 
Smell is huge!!! Big time bourbon, vanilla, coconut, and caramel. A hint of biscotti aroma in there also.
Taste is not surprisingly VERY sweet. The coconut and vanilla smacks your taste buds right away and then a nice bourbon and oak flavor comes in. Almost has a cinnamon spice to it. Caramel, molasses, brown sugar, and even a marshmallow type of flavor going on. 
Feel is as expected. Thick and full bodied and drinks like a dessert. Very little carbonation.
Overall this is a nice beer BUT it is insanely sweet. This may be the sweetest and richest beer I've ever had. 800 charactersaoampm, Apr 27, 2017

Appearance is dark brown/black with no real head or lacing
Smell is sweet chocolate, litght coconut and caramely malt.
The first thing you notice in the taste is tons of sugar. This beer is VERY sweet. Taste is light chocolate and caramel with some spice. It kind of reminds me of the roasted cinnamon almonds you buy at a sporting event. The alcohol isn't really a factor other than if you drink it too fast.
Body is a little heavy and sticky, but what do you expect from a 15% porter?
Overall a decent beer. I'd prefer just a bit less sweetness. This would kill as a desert beer. Worth a try for porter and stout lovers. 675 charactersLahey, Apr 26, 2017

A: Pours thick, cola like in appearance, very little to no head
S: Vanilla, cinnamon, coconut, bourbon, and something unidentifiable that's uniquely associated with Vietnamese sweets
T: Sweet, almost a worthy as a 2014 Goose Island Proprietor's (maybe better).  I get more sweetness in the front with the bourbon in the background
M: The sugary sweetness lingers around the mouth
O: Quite possibly the best BA porter I've had.  Very worthy of taking over as the best beer I've tasted (GI 2014 Proprietor's).  If it wasn't labeled as a porter, it could be easily be described as a stout. 671 charactersBRami127, Apr 20, 2017

The label references Walter Sobchak (John Goodman) from the Big Lebowski...
Translucent brown on the pour, black in the glass. Produced a brief, slim dark foam head; left no lace down the glass. Aromas of molasses, vanilla, and maybe licorice. The flavors were similar - sweet, and with the addition of vague impressions of deep dark, spiced and booze-soaked fruit and something chocolaty. Feel was thin and flat, a little sticky on the finish. Despite having all the trappings of a big hit, this beer was not to my tastes... 819 charactersGreywulfken, Apr 17, 2017

4.34/5  rDev -2.3%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25Optics are expected for the style. Aroma is fantastic, starts with a warm wave of bourbon caramel, oak & vanilla, but the addition of the coconut really takes it to another level. It isn't over-the-top & melds so perfectly with those bourbon aromas. You can get some sugar underneath too which pushes it close to the too sweet category but straddles that line expertly. 
The sugar is more noticeable on the tongue & indeed there is a very treacly punch as soon as it hits your mouth. The mid-palate is all decadent bourbon flavors, all very smooth, but I really wanted more of that great cocunut from the nose. You can find it in there but it is buried too much by the bourbon, and I agree with most that the sugar is just a notch too high. The base beer adds a nice chocolate malt towards the end.  Overall a very good beer but with some minor tweaks could have been a real knock-put. 886 charactersajm5108, Apr 11, 2017

First few ounces were interesting, though I personally found them overwhelmingly too sweet.  The sweetness soon became overbearing.  Myself and my neighbor left the last third and pushed away.  Really glad I tried it - just way too sweet for my liking.

Served in a DFH snifter, the beer pours dark brown/black with about a half inch tan head that didn't stay around for too long.  There's a small amount of lacing.  Aroma is nice and sweet, the brew smells like chocolate, coconut, vanilla, bourbon, brown sugar and a bit of coffee.  Taste is similar to the aroma, it tastes like coconut, chocolate, molasses, brown sugar, vanilla, bourbon, nuts, and some coffee.  Kinda reminds me of an Almond Joy bar.  Mostly sweet but the barrel character isn't strong, I'm guessing the overall sweetness of this beer just overpowers everything else.  Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's coating with a moderate amount of carbonation.  I liked this overall, but if you don't care for really sweet tasting brews then you might want to pass on it.  $14.99 a bomber. 829 charactersbluejacket74, Mar 31, 2017

Served in a snifter
This beer pours black in color and is topped with an inch of tan head that leaves little lacing.
The aroma has chocolate, caramel, vanilla, alcohol, and a little coconut. 
The taste starts out sweet and sugary with some alcohol. Flavors of caramel, vanilla, coconut, and bourbon jump out at my palate. 
Thick and syrupy mouthfeel with low carbonation
This beer seems a little raw. The smell is nice. The flavors seems all over the place and not cohesive. I have another bottle that I will sit on for a year or so and see if the flavors meld and the alcohol mellows. That said, I like this beer. The alcohol taste cuts the sweetness to an extent letting me know I am consuming an intoxicating beverage and not just dessert. 776 charactersbuschbeer, Mar 12, 2017

S - Rich, full vanilla and coconut and barrel hit, with bit of coffee, and a rich brownie batter note.
T - So rich, the open is sweet and full, coconut and brownies, and a close where the coffee hit comes forward, mild and underlining the robust barrel and bourbon notes.
M - Full and sticky.  A bit of drying in the close that keeps it from becoming too taxing.
O - Among the few that deliver a rich, full experience that approaches BCBS and its ilk.  Lovely and tasty, and so delicious.  Will pick this up again. 632 charactersTsar_Riga, Mar 05, 2017

Smells strongly of sweet whiskey, a little vanilla, coconut, brown sugar
A lot going on here: toffee, caramel, coconut, vanilla, barrel, a hint of chocolate but very sweet throughout (weird that the strong barrel presence doesn't cut into the sweetness more)
Extremely viscous, almost syrupy, astringent on the finish with some bourbon heat followed by warming

L - Pours dark brown and syrupy.  No Head.
S - Cinnamon and bourbon.  A really nice combination.  There are more hints of coconut as it warms.
T - I get lots of coconut and some bourbon.  But, there is tons of cane sugary sweetness.  Almost cloying sweet.  Surprisingly it didn't leave a sugary aftertaste.
F - Very very slick and sticky.  Lip smacking.
O - I like sweet beers, but DAMN!  This was a little too much. 446 charactersbrewaddict, Jan 31, 2017
3.38/5  rDev -23.9%look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.252016 vintage (purple bowling ball). Pours almost black with a very small dark khaki head that quickly fades leaving little retention and no lacing, which can be expected for such a high gravity beer. The aromas are sweet and have a nice amount of chocolate and coconut. The bourbon is definitely there without dominating or overwhelming. Some subtle hints of sweet fruits in the mix. The flavors are bold and very sweet. It's borderline cloying. I don't mind sweet beers at all, but this is almost over the top. More chocolate and coconut leading the way. A nice amount of vanilla and cake frosting. Lots of sugar along with some molasses. The bourbon definitely does its thing and ultimately blends well with all of the adjuncts. It's borderline boozy, but becomes more "balanced" the more you get into it. It's definitely warm with some alcohol notes. It finishes slightly spicy. Mouthfeel is full-bodied. It's not thick and has active to moderate carbonation. It's slightly fluffy. This makes for a great sipper because it drinks huge and has alot going on. 
This is an interesting brew. It definitely has alot going on. It's very sweet. It starts off very rough around the edges, but finds itself the more you get into it. Ultimately I'm not personally crazy about it, but I can appreciate it. It's not bad, but possibly "overrated" due to the ratings and hype, in my opinion. 1,381 charactersBB1313, Jan 31, 2017

Good bourbon notes on the nose gives the beer a raisin smell, reminding me more of a barley wine, but the coffee pokes through at the end.  Rich, roasty and sweet on the palate, and once again the hint of coffee in the background.  Velvety finish.  Dropping the 5 as the overall score, as I was not told until afterwards that this is a 15% brew.  Amazing. 461 charactersgibgink, Jan 23, 2017

4.84/5  rDev +9%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Wow, what a surprise. Purchased this for 15.99 after watching the dust build up at local store.  Boy was I treated an incredible world-class delicacy. 
True story.... My friends (2 are licensed cicerones) and I were tasting last night. We keep passing on this for more popular names like Cigar city, Hill Farmstead, Three Floyds, etc.  Finally, after no more were left, we hesitantly opened. The look, smell, feel and taste is exactly what a barrel aged porter should.  Every person there handed me $$ and told me to get them as many as I could from my store. One guy grabbed his coat and was going to leave to get some.
 As you can see by my profile, I don't rate beers. I had to rate this one to tell you to find this hidden gem and taste for yourself. I didn't rate it perfect because I didn't want anyone skipping over the rating.  I'm not going to explain the beer because words can't describe it.  Forewarning, it does have sweetness to it. 948 charactersDonaldearl, Jan 21, 2017

Aroma is coconut, hint of vanilla, hint of bourbon, lots of sugary notes. Definitely a bit of chocolate too. Smells very sweet.
Taste is over the top sweet! Brown sugar, molasses, toffee, caramel, hint of vanilla, bit of coconut. Almost like a candy bar and barely any bourbon or barrel notes. Unbalanced.
Medium bodied, sticky glaze on lips, syrupy body, hidden alcohol.

4.06/5  rDev -8.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 3.75Imperial porter brewed with coconut and turbinado sugar aged for several months in bourbon barrels. Poured from a bottle into a MadTree snifter. The beer is nearly black, not too viscous, and sports very little head. A whiff of the bottle before pouring yields strong aromas of coconut and freshly-baked cookies. After pouring, I get strong bourbon notes, toasted oak, and some sweet boozy aromas.
Full body with an oily feel and an intensely sweet flavor. Massive notes of brown sugar, toffee, milk chocolate and cafe latte up front. At mid-palate, toasted coconut, hazelnut, and rich bourbon. The finish is a sugary blast of chocolate sauce, caramel, and coconut with lots of rummy alcohol notes.
Gotta love a beer that references one of my favorite movies - The Big Lebowski (``Am I the only one who gives a s**t about the rules?''), but gosh is this stuff sweet! The flavor is wonderful, but the high level of sweetness detracts from the drinkability in my opinion. I couldn't handle more than a small serving. I have to wonder if this beer might not be better without the turbinado sugar in there. At 15% ABV, this beer should taste plenty sweet without any extra help. The taste of this beer made me think of the "chocolate frosted sugar bombs" breakfast cereal from the old Calvin and Hobbes comic strip. 1,313 charactersdeadonhisfeet, Jan 11, 2017

The smell is strong bourbon, maple syrup, and coconut.  The taste is unreal. Like drinking maple syrup.  There is bourbon, maple, chocolate, and coconut and perfectly balanced.  I hate coconut and I loved this beer.  The mouthfeel is like thick silk.  This may be the thickest beer I've tasted, and it's a porter!  It's incredibly smooth.  As it warms the flavors meld perfectly.  Overall this is an outstanding beer I hope to get again next year. 577 charactersjvgoor3786, Jan 01, 2017
3.88/5  rDev -12.6%look: 2.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5Pours very flat. Black color, no head at all (a second pouring did produce a pinky finger head that disappeared in seconds, Pro tip: if you want to see at least that much just go for it on the pour tilt the bottle straight up and let it fly.). Aroma- vanilla, cherries, kinda reminds me of an opened packet of coolade mix. Caramel, and just a hint of alcohol. Taste- some bitterness that stays with this beer some alcohol that stays throughout. This is a pretty sweet sugary beer. Some vanilla and caramel. For a barrel aged beer there is not as much of an alcohol presence as you might think for a 15%er. Mouthfeel is a bit thin and slick. Overall, sweet beer, good tasting, not off putting. Smells great! Get ya some. 719 charactersNoYouDidnt, Jan 01, 2017

4.17/5  rDev -6.1%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4The "Purple ball" release poured from a 22oz. bottle into a stemless wine glass. 
It is a cola like black color with a very moderate, whispy light tan head. 
Super strong coconut aroma. It also smells very sweet. Almost like a vanilla frosting. Definitely a confection sugar thing going on. Bourbon notes provide a backdrop. 
The coconut is still the star of the show when it comes to flavor, but not as quite as dominant as the aroma. I think the crystalized brown/molasses like sugar flavor is equally as noticeable. The amount of barrel character with some oak and char is very nice, and never seems like 15%. There is a little bit of spiced coffee (cardamom?), bitter sweet chocolate, and roasted malt, but the sweetness keeps pounding everything else into submission. 
A Founders Porter like body. A heavy medium. Fairly silky. 
This one was tough to score. I think if I had just drank a 5oz pour I may have it higher, but it is just so rich, and sweet that it became a real chore to get through it. Even with some help. The coconut didn't bother me as much as the strong granulated sugar presence. With some more coffee/roasted grains this thing would be killer. I enjoyed it and was slightly disappointed at the same time. All I can say is I am glad I only got 1 bottle and recommend finding it on tap. 1,314 charactersWesMantooth, Dec 27, 2016

Purchased to commemorate my father's valiant duty during his time in the Marines during 'Nam. He escaped being a P.O.W. & earned a Purple Heart for being shot through the hand and severe shrapnel wounds to the abdomen and lower back. He's told me plenty of stories about drinking "tiger piss", so without further ado.............. Once poured from the bomber bottle into a snifter, this brew's head is two fingers thick, with impenetrable lacing, and a body as dark as the inside of a sensory deprivation tank once the lid is shut .
           I smell mammoth notes of malts, coconut, and good ol' fashioned hooch. 
          Tastes like huge carmalized malts, heaps of  what I'll go ahead and guess is the addition of turbinado sugar, with mellowing characterizations as a result of the bourbon barrel aging. The boozy-ness is undoubtedly present, but it is really more of another compliment to help round out this brew; so it is not too sharp or hot. Nice&easy :)
          The mouthfeel is thick and smooth, with zero burn from the 15% abv. Mild carbonation. 
          Overall, I'll rate No Rules | Perrin Brewery with a 4.5. I'm impressed that is as mellow, yet exploding with flavor. Again, thanks to all who've served. 1,256 charactersCaveworm, Dec 26, 2016

4.46/5  rDev +0.5%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5To make bourbon, there's a lot of rules. To make wine, there's also a lot of rules. Most beverages have layer upon layer of criteria to follow, but the beer industry is another story. Perrin brewers throw the rule book out of the window when venturing into a lavishly sweet, savory and stern porter of epic proportions.
No Rules kicks off with a robust dark brown, easily disguised as stout, type of darkness. With a firm mocha whipped crown, the beer is almost too good looking to drink. ...almost. Mounds candy bars come to mind as the dark chocolate, coconut and caramel seep into the olfactory senses. Its taste is lavish with caramel, coconut, chocolate, coffee and cream.
And those old fashion coconut candy impression roll onto the middle palate on the back of the robust porter below. Dark-roast coffee, bittersweet chocolate, burnt toast and seared sweetness carry a marshmallowy texture and a velvety smooth vanilla and heavy cream finish. Charred oak, pecan, and a light tannic wood character are soft and are largely lost on the beer's coconut additions.
Full, rich and with absolute decadence, the creamy and dense beer is a slow sipping affair, one that relishes in an extended finish and aftertaste of bourbon, coconut and dark chocolate. Warm with simmering booze, a familiar taste of Kentucky bourbon balls suggest that this beer isn't a good complement for dessert, but rather replaces dessert altogether. 1,426 charactersBEERchitect, Dec 20, 2016

Vigorous pour yielded a quarter inch of caramel foam, which dissipated quickly. Nose is almost all bourbon, with slight hints of chocolate/caramel candy. The initial flavor is slight heat, not sure if it's the barrel or the spice, but it gives way to an almost cordial-like flavor that coats the tongue nicely. Overall, the beer's sweetness does not overpower its brandyish warming effects. 478 charactersbeerwolf72, Dec 15, 2016

L: A bit dark for a porter.  Looks like a standard stout in terms of color and thickness. Beige head that dissipates quickly.  
S: Certainly on the sweet side.  Nice sticky bourbon smell with coconut.  Some vanilla and oak.  Alcohol presence is notable but not overpowering.  Relatively promising overall.
T: Disappointing.  At cellar temp, coconut and sugar complete for top billing with some vanilla notes and very little barrel.  Surprisingly crisp with a short finish.  The fact that generic sugar is the only lingering flavor is perhaps the beer's biggest downfall.  Surprisingly drinkable for the ABV.   As it warms toward room temperature, alcohol is much more pronounced, overpowering other flavors.  
F: Moderate carbonation.  Syrupy.
O: I love a sweetly flavored beer where the sweetness is something other than basic sugar.  For example, a sweet chocolately/toffee/bourbon/etc.flavor profile is something that I love.  However, I struggle with beers that are "just sweet" and the sweetness is nothing but sugar.  This beer definitely fits the latter and is essentially a sugar bomb.   The drinkability at cellar temp is perhaps its biggest strength, but this definitely disappears as it warms and turns from a slight mess into a full-fledged hot mess. 1,282 charactersGaddabble, Dec 11, 2016

Smell is BIG and SWEET: heavy coconut up front with cream, vanilla, cinnamon and sugar.  A virtual smorgasbord of dessert-y goodness.  Taste is similar with loads of coconut, cream and turbinado sugar.  The alcohol is noticeable but for a 15% ABV beer it's pretty tame; not "hot" at all.  Deep and complex flavors throughout.  Feel is excellent and is the feel is more stout than porter.  Thick, creamy and sticks to your mouth.
Suggested food pairing: Chocolate lava cake

Overall: 4.5 (This beer is very good and I would definitely drink it again)  Given the sweetness and alcohol content this isn't an everyday kind of beer.  But for what it is - a slow sipping, specialty, dessert beer - it's pretty fantastic.  This almost drinks more like a liqueur than a beer.  Loads of flavor, great nose, great mouthfeel.  If you have the chance, this is definitely one to try. 1,035 charactersSHDoyle, Dec 10, 2016

Pours dark, dark brown with no head at all. Tons of alcohol legs sticking around the glass. The aroma is very interesting: heat right away, coconut, maple, cinnamon, the turbanado sugar definitely coming through lending those notes. Not much barrel other than pure heat. Really interesting. 
Taste is very sweet, right away. I get a nice amount of fluffy marshmallow character, that is followed up by some heat, chocolate, perhaps some green apple, and coconut. No bourbon at all. If it is there, it has disguised itself. Would never have known it was barrel aged. 
22oz bomber is definitely a little much as the sweetness of this beer really starts to linger. 
I think, all-in-all, a very interesting, but delicious beer. Seems sort of fake with the flavor additions, but they work together. Really nice. 889 charactersraynmoon, Dec 10, 2016

This beer poured a dark black color with a very thin dark tan head on top that disappeared very quickly. 
The nose is where this beer starts to shine lots of real wonderful aromas going on here. I got some molasses with lots of great bourbon and that sweet coconut aroma with maybe just a hint of coffee.
The taste is even better than the nose. It is sweet but to me not overly so. Lots of great coconut and bourbon here with the sweetness of turbinado sugar. You might want to think a mounds bar soaked in bourbon but maybe not quite that sweet. 
The mouthfeel is smooth I have to remember this is a porter not a stout but to me thicker than your average porter. 
To me a great beer. Love the way bourbon and the coconut work together in this.  To  me you would never know this is a 15% ABV beer. 898 characterssmanson56, Dec 04, 2016

Poured dark brown to near black with a nice tan he'd which dissipated quickly. Strong aroma of sweet bourbon liqueur and fresh molasses. Also picking up some sweet malt with hints of brown sugar. The taste is insane. May take a few more sips to really understand what's going on. Very complex. Thick and rich mouthfeel with tons of sweetness. Tons of vanilla, bourbon, coconut, dried fruit, molasses--all the flavors you'd expect in a complex stout, but wait, this is a porter.  Not picking up the normal coffee flavors typically found in porters. Ok. I just fibbed. Picked up the coffee on the front edge of the intense coconut. This was a 22oz bottle and I'm glad to be sharing it with two friends. I think an 8-10 oz serving is good for this beer. Definitely putting a bottle of this in the cellar. Try this!

A - snifter pour. Surprisingly mild color. More if extremely dark brown than black. Thin mocha head. Thin, clean, alcohol laden lacing. 
S - Brown sugar and bourbon. Light oak. Good amount of vanilla. Smells oh so sweet. 
T - Holy shit. That's the sweetest beer I've ever had. Did they dump sugar in it after fermentation and prior to bottling? Loads of vanilla. Faint barrel character. The coconut is prominent midway through to the finish. Alcohol is there but more like 8-9% tasting than the whopping 15% that it is. This is yet another beer I wish were only 12oz and not a bomber.
M - chewy, sticky, and creamy. 
O - I love a sweet stout/porter but this might actually be a bit much. I'm 1/6 of the way through this and I'm scared to imagine how heavy the last sips will taste.
Overall I'll definitely buy this again and can see it aging very, very well. If I can scoop up another this year I'll do so and let it rest for several years. 976 charactersrypkr, Nov 29, 2016

Black-brown elixir into snifter, 1/2 inch brown head, quickly to a thin rim. No lacing but legs on all sides.
Vanilla, chocolate, coconut, caramel, brown sugar, coffee, barrel.  A really nice amalgam of flavors.
Sweet brown sugar, coconut oil, vanilla, oak and bourbon.  The sweetness of the brown sugar decreases as the brew warms, allowing the barrel and booze to provide a nice counter.
 Sticky, slightly under carbonated with the alcohol well hidden.
This had the potential to be a home run but the sugar sweetness overwhelms. Still a nice dessert sipper. 628 charactersCaptCleveland, Nov 26, 2016

Medium foam head upon pour which dissipates into a very dark liquid with no foam head.  Aroma has some good dark malts and light coffee.  But the taste exceeded the expectations presented by the aroma. Loads of coconut, mild vanilla, cocoa and coffee present as well.  The after taste is smoother than expected for a 15%abv but the bourbon note is unmistakable.  A very good BA porter and beer in general which I wouldn't hesitate to get again. 478 characterseifster82, Oct 25, 2016

3.98/5  rDev -10.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4650ml bottle, 2016 batch, poured into a stemless wine glass. Enjoyed on 10.9.16, reviewed from Tasting Journal.
The beer pours a jet black color, cola brown hues with a thick khaki head, about a finger high that has good retention and nice spotted lace. The aroma is really intense, tons of brown sugar, charred oak, bourbon barrel, light coconut and a coffee like roast, nice robust porter base with some dark bitter chocolate that lingers with plenty of alcohol warmth. The flavors are massive, this is definitely a monster beer, tons of caramel and brown sugar, very rich toffee from the barrel, roasted grain, bourbon and chewy oak, mild coconut comes out more as it warms up with bitter baker's chocolate and alcohol heat. The mouthfeel is good, medium body with lively carbonation not the most coating and a bit unexpected for how big this beer is as the finish is hot and thin.
Verdict: A nice BA Porter from Perrin, very drinkable despite the high ABV. Lots of flavor, nice complexity, very warm and hot, but good showing of the coconut that plays well with the bourbon barrel. Not my favorite BA Porter, but definitely one I'd like to enjoy again sometime. 1,167 characterskevanb, Oct 18, 2016

Aroma of vanilla and bourbon with some sweet candy-lie notes and faint roasted malt notes is quite pleasant. Taste is a mix of faint roasted malt with plenty of residual sugar notes with light perfumy notes, some vanilla and bourbon notes are also observable. Body is somewhat full with nice creamy texture with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. The coconut and turpido sugar makes for a very nice dessert type beer but sugar does become overwhelming at some point. 591 charactersPhyl21ca, Sep 20, 2016

Huge aromas on this, sweet coconut coffee.  Notes of coffee, toffee, vanilla, light oak, toasted coconut, milk chocolate, cocoa powder, and a touch of molasses.  Very complex, sweet, really on the edge of cloying which is why I dinged it a bit.  Feel is hefty, creamy and coating.  Thick film on the pallet leaves the flavors around for a while.  You can not be drinking this and feel like you're drinking it.  This is an extreme stout, huge and heavy handed in everything it does.  It's not perfect but when the mood is right this is sublime. 708 charactersHopBomb515, Aug 24, 2016

Smell-oak, boozy bourbon, and a really nice fudgey chocolate.  bold
Taste-fudge bourbon oak brownie!  complex and bold.  really amazing, especially after being a bit concerned from the appearance
Feel-really easy to drink. minimal booze, minimal heat.  would prefer it to be a little creamier but this does drink really nice when considering the ABV
Overall-pretty enjoyable beer here.  Will gladly drink the other bottle or two that I have after letting them age a little like this one.  Great work Perrin! 644 charactersrabbott2, Aug 17, 2016

A- Pours a mostly opaque black color with a 1/2 inch tan head that retains decently before becoming a thin ring around the edge of the glass and minimal surface foam.  Not-so-resilient lacing leaves small specs behind.  
S- Smells extremely sweet with some barrel character coming through.  I mainly get caramel, milk chocolate and big brown sugar.  Also a noticeable booze fume.  It basically smells like a Werther's Original.
T- Hard hit of coconut and then a flood of milk chocolate and caramel with the barrel tying everything together to maintain an air of complexity with all this diabetes going on.  Chocolate aftertaste plus some wood.  The alcohol is certainly noticeable but all the flavor components do a good job of concealing it.
M- Silky smooth with medium-low carbonation and a full body.
O- Very, very good.   However, I feel like it's missing something, or perhaps has too much going on, to be considered truly exceptional.  The sweetness of this beer is off the charts.  I like sweet things but even this is a bit much for me.  The barrel quality is good and it meshes decently with the overall profile but it's a bit disjointed.  I am, admittedly, nitpicking since this is a tasty beer for sure.  Just needs to be seen for what it is: Great, not excellent.  At least in my opinion. 1,345 charactersImmortale25, Aug 05, 2016

Looks good, nice kahki head. 
Smell at first lots of Malts, almost like a Baltic porter. Some bourbon and sweetness
Taste is not how I remember, before it was a fantastic balance between bourbon, sugar and coconut. This batch is all sugar, I don't even taste the coconut. Super sugar bomb, almost to the point of undrinkable
Mouthfeel is really good! But it carries the sugar straight over the toungue, 
I'm a fan of sweet, but I think I like barrel sweet over sugar sweet. If your trading for this guy I recommended trading for the green bowling ball vintage. I still have a bottle of it I'll have to crack it soon if that's true and not my pallet 814 charactersKevSal, Jul 24, 2016

4.56/5  rDev +2.7%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Appearance - The appearance was a muky black color with a slight mocha head. 
Smell - The nose is boozy coconut, though it fades in time. 
Taste - The initial is sweet, syrupy chocolate. Notes of coconut, coffee, and booze are present. The booze is not overwhelming. In fact, when the 15% abv is considered, the booze is very well masked. The beer runs slightly warm, but does not burn. 
Mouthfeel - For a porter, the feel is spot on. Yet I felt the barrel aging should do more.
Overall - This is fantastic! 511 charactersJohnnyHopps, Jul 05, 2016

Undated bomber at 42 degrees into hand washed and dried JK snifter
Aroma – coconut, roasted malt, bourbon, and vanillin
Head – small (Maximum 2 cm, aggressive pour), light brown, creamy with rocks, diminishing to a two to three mm ring and thin partial layer
Lacing – fair.  Narrow broken rings that are definitely lacy.  Mostly tiny bubbles.
Body dark brown, opaque
Flavor – coconut and bourbon predominate, some roasted malt; no hops, no alcohol (15%!), no diacetyl
Palate – medium, watery, soft carbonation
WOW!  This is definitely the best beer I’ve had in a while and the best I’ve ever had from Perrin.  At 15% ABV, it’ll definitely put you down, but the alcohol is totally hidden except for a slight stomach warming.  Is it the coconut?  Don’t know.  I rarely support “cause” brews but this one is definitely an exception – a great brew and a great cause!  Time to limp back to MI and buy a case!

Smooth coconut comes off the nose first, seemingly mellowed out by the aging, in nice way. Vanilla comes after, with soft chocolate notes, then oak. All of a sudden I start smelling pecan pie. I get almost no booze off this monster of a brew, until it warms up considerably. When it does, the heat is accompanied by a sugary-sweet, sticky rim that really brings to mind syrup-drenched pancakes.
Right up front, I taste well-aged maple, which is a complete shock to the senses, as it's is more prominent than in many beers that claim to be brewed with it, yet I don't see anywhere that this actually is. Coconut is delicately present in the background, with the sugar making itself quite apparent, leaving me to wonder how this beer got to be so popular, considering so many of you really hate sweet brews. The sweetness mingles with the oak as a little booze spice emerges, as such, in combination with all of the other attributes, it actually comes across like a good rum at times. Then, here it comes again, that overwhelming urge for me to mutter pecan pie. I really get that nice, warming memory of pecan pie once No Rules reaches the perfect temperature.
No Rules is exceedingly luxurious with a velvetty round mouthfeel. For the most part, there is only a small tingle of alcohol in the back of the throat, which is phenomenal for this strong of a barrel aged beer. Kudos are indeed in order because I typically can't stand the overpowering, boozy nature of many in this style, but No Rules skirts those pitfalls to my delight. 1,625 charactersSabtos, Jun 24, 2016

Smell:  Smells wonderful, vanilla, cinnamon, caramel
Taste:   A LOT of the vanilla and cinnamon from the nose comes through in the flavor.  Those are the two most prominent flavors in this beer. A bit of malt backing.  No bitterness in this beer.  
Feel:  Thinner than you'd expect, but goes down smooth.  Alcohol warmth is definitely present.  A sipper for sure.  
Overall:  A really amazing beer, great to share with a couple of friends (as I'd have a hell of a time drinking it all alone!). 542 charactersjpearce4, Jun 16, 2016

I will be honest, you have to like sweet to be a huge fan of this beer, but it hit all the feels with the Vietnamese coffee, barrel aging and coconut/sugar. These all meld together to create a maple syrup like sensation with the bourbon shining through. I would never say I wish I lived in the state up north, but I would love access to this beer when it is released. I get it whenever I can. 502 charactersKuges, May 24, 2016

4.68/5  rDev +5.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Pour is a nice dark brown hue, tight khaki colored head settles down to a small ring. Great retention.
Smell is pretty much foward with everything, and everything is dispersed equally. Vanilla, burnt coconut, caramel, brown sugar, chocolate, toffee.
Damn, definitely a dessert bomb. Nice amount of sweet vanilla, burnt coconut and caramel initially. Very subtle amounts of bourbon and wood in the back end. No way this is 15%, no alcohol present whatsoever. Can't even detect a hint of roasted malt bitterness. Even better as it warms, as the toasted coconut and rich chocolate flavors stand out even more. 
Mouthfeel is relatively thin as most porters, but very velvety and a smooth drinker. 695 charactersMateo2699, May 22, 2016

4.09/5  rDev -7.9%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Sticky sweet, with the turbinado sugar winning the day, outclassing its competitors, coconut and oak barrel, by half. I was actually hoping for more booziness from the 15% and bourbon barrels, but I'm disappointed on that front. Very smooth, though, which is tricky for such a big beer. The coconut is indeed prominent, along with hints of chocolate malt balls and buttercream icing. Not soy, but I also get a strong dose of umami.
Love the concept, and I can understand the acclaim, but it's not quite to my tastes. It could use a little bitterness to balance out the flavor profile. 585 charactersdarktronica, May 11, 2016

Bottle shared by Mike the other night, thanks dude.
This pours a thick and massive looking black, with a very small head, and not much lacing.
Smells like caramelized brown sugar, coconut, chocolate syrup, bourbon, and dark fruits.
This is absolutely diabetes in a glass, it's absurdly sweet. However, having it at a bottle share, and getting about 4 oz of it was perfect. Much more than that would have been overkill. I got a good amount of coconut, but the other people at the share didn't get much. I get some sweet dark fruit/cherry sort of flavor, as well as sweet bourbon, and some syrupy chocolate. It's an absolute miracle that the booze does not poke through this one at all. It makes it easier to drink for sure.
This is pretty thick and syrupy, with a surprisingly present level of carbonation for a 15% stout. It's not too high, it's just surprising.
A messy sugar bomb for sure, but it definitely tasted good. 987 charactersGreesyFizeek, Apr 11, 2016

On the lighter side of porters in terms of color. Taste is very sweet, maybe little too sweet bordering dessert beer. However in combination with the bourbon it works and barely notice the ABV. Did not get any coconut which is ok since I am not a fan of it. Overall solid. 355 charactersGambyt20, Apr 05, 2016

S: Coconuts, molasses, and melted Mounds bars
T: Burst of caramelized brown sugar, reminiscent of bananas foster cooked table side, coupled with a healthy dose of coconut, macadamia nuts, mocha coffee, dark chocolate, Gosling's Black Seal Rum, and a shot of Four Roses - rest assured the high ABV is well hidden
F: Not absurdly thick like BCBS or a TG stout, but a tick on the thinner side of a medium mouthfeel with subtle carbonation
O: I cracked this batch 1 about a year after bottling and man, it was a treat. Tropical mocha flavors paired with an even barrel aging made the flavor incredibly complex, but also very accessible and tasty. Not sure if saying that this is the best porter I've ever had is tantamount to saying 'this is the tallest little person I've ever met', but wow, Perrin really killed it on this one. Wonderfully complex and well executed - seek this one out! 951 charactersFireman_RK, Apr 05, 2016

Taste: upfront brown sugar molasses middle of the mouth toasted coconut vanilla dark cherries strong maple syrup that drives into the finish. In the finish milk chocolate oak hints of bourbon and more of that syrupy sweetness.
Feel: this a huge beer a definite sipper medium bodied soft on the pallet.
Overall: worth the hype! It's very sweet but Its not to sweet.Super balanced. This is amazing! At 15% you get almost no alchool taste just a hint in the finish and a warming feeling in the chest.One of the best beers I've ever had. 603 charactersMasonz223, Apr 05, 2016

4.47/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Well, shit. Had a whole review typed up and accidentally closed my tab. Dammit. $5 for a 5oz pour at Clubhouse BFD.
The tap list didn't specify which batch this was. I missed out on batch one, but I heard batch two has quite a bit of cinnamon -- I get none of it in here. This beer, to me, sort of tastes like heavily syruped pancakes. This is one of the sweeter beers I've had, with fairly strong flavors of maple syrup and molasses. The finish is where it's at on this beer, as it's where the vanilla and barrel start to come through... to be honest, I think it's the barrel with the turbinado together that give me a pancake-y vibe. I don't get much coconut in this beer though. I've had a bigger coconut presence in beers that don't even have coconut in them -- like BCBS.
The biggest thing that bums me out about this beer is its sweetness. Really though, it's probably a good thing it's as sweet as it is, because the freakin' beer is 15%. I'd like the roasted malt to impart a bit more bitterness to balance it all out, but it's still delicious. The mouthfeel isn't super heavy, but it is bordering closely on the line of syrupy. There's a definite bit of alcohol warmth, and it drinks "big", but the 15% is well-hidden for the most part.
It's a damn good beer, but a touch too sweet, even for me -- and I love the likes of Chocolate Manifesto and Choklat. The sweetness of this is keeping it at the low-end of my absolute favorites. Whatever batch this was, I was pleased, and I'm glad I purchased three bottles of batch two (thanks Aaron, bruh). I look forward to seeing what the hell happens to them over the months and maybe years. Crack a bottle open among a group of friends and/or family and enjoy. 1,715 charactersSerialTicker, Apr 02, 2016

4.77/5  rDev +7.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75I had the pleasure of previously having two bottles from the 2015 release and just shared a 2016.  Purchased from Wine Seller in Ann Arbor.  
The 2016 release was super sweet, with tons of sugar, cinnamon, and coconut.  The sweetness was more bold in the 2016 bottle, most likely due to it being a fresh pour vs. the previous two bottles I had that were aged for ~4-5 months.  I think I enjoyed the 2015 tastings more and look forward to trying a 2016 bottle later this year with a little age on it.
With all that said, I am in love with this beer.  If you don't enjoy sweet beers (I do!), you may not be as impressed. 620 charactersiliketurtlesthx, Mar 31, 2016

4.63/5  rDev +4.3%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Pours very dark in color (nearly black), with a light khaki colored head that sticks around a while.  The beer doesn't appear to be as dense as I expected it to be, but good color and other visuals.
It's aroma is unearthly boozy.  Alcohol warmth surrounds layers of molasses, brown sugar, black licorice, oak, fudge brownies, and lots of maple syrup aroma towards the finish.  And more brown sugar again.
Lots of chocolate in it's flavor.  Aside it I notice vanilla, maple sugar, brown sugar, cream of coconut, and really just lots of sweet, sugary flavors melding together to make one silky smooth treat.  A dessert beer I must say.  
It's mouthfeel is smooth and velvety.  Carbonation is quite light.  It's very warm, but at 15% I would expect it to be.  
This is a must try if you're able to get it! 806 charactersjp32, Mar 30, 2016

From a bomber into a snifter
Imperial Porter aged in bourbon barrels for several months
Brewed with coconut and turbinado sugar
Killing Craft Series
APPEARANCE: A clear light brown pour yields a 2+ finger, slightly looser, foamy, light tan head with good retention. Clear bistre brown body with no carbonation evident. Head recedes to a  foamy cap. A slight wisp and ring remains until the end leaving touches of lacing down the glass. A bit lack luster head. Lighter in color, even for an imperial porter. 
SMELL: Heavy barrel on the nose with bourbon, oak, vanilla cream, milk chocolate, pure chocolate fudge, brownies, light coconut notes and some butterscotch. Some toffee notes as well. Really nice and advertises sweetness all over the place. Really good. 
TASTE: More coconut up front in the flavor. Alcohol as well with bourbon and woody oak at the swallow. A medium but lingering finish of oak, bourbon, some alcohol, milk chocolate, vanilla cream and lots of coconut for sure. Piles more coconut than the nose had advertised, though not nearly as decadent in the chocolate and fudge department. The alcohol was a little too noticeable as well. 
PALATE: Slightly thinner body and some prickly carbonation. Needs to be creamier for sure. Goes down with a burn and finishes rather sticky. Lots of heat lingers. 
OVERALL: This was alright I guess. The nose was rather nice, but the look was less than impressive and the body rather thin and abrasive. The flavor just didn’t measure up either, being too boozy and missing some of the nice chocolate fudge character the nose had advertised. This one could be re-worked and the ABV brought down quite a bit, perhaps. An interesting brew, nevertheless. Cheers again dboon! Always a pleasure. 1,800 charactersJeffo, Mar 17, 2016

I think a little more coffee could have made it even better but a fantastic beer nonetheless. 310 charactersW_Des, Jan 19, 2016

Aroma is intense bourbon with brown sugar and roasted malts. Lots of caramelized sugars and barrel character. Flavor brings about milk chocolate, caramel,  and ample sweetness that really pushes the limits without becoming cloying. Coconut makes its way through on the back end to add another layer of complexity. Feel is creamy, but not overly thick or syrupy. Goes down fairly smooth for 15%, but lets you know it's there as it warms the chest. A damn fine effort. 548 charactersBosoxfan20, Jan 12, 2016

Pours nearly opaque dark brown/black color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big milk chocolate, caramel, coconut, vanilla, toffee, brown sugar, toasted oak, bourbon, maple, molasses, light cocoa/coffee, light raisin/fig, and oak/toasted earthiness. Fantastic aromas with awesome balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt, coconut/brown sugar, and bourbon barrel notes; with good strength. Taste of huge milk chocolate, caramel, coconut, vanilla, toffee, brown sugar, toasted oak, bourbon, maple, molasses, light cocoa/coffee, light raisin/fig, and oak/toasted earthiness. Moderate bourbon/oak spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of milk chocolate, caramel, coconut, vanilla, toffee, brown sugar, toasted oak, bourbon, maple, molasses, light raisin/fig, and oak/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roasted malt, coconut/brown sugar, and bourbon barrel flavors; with an incredible malt/oak spiciness balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Some light-moderate dryness from oak spiciness after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium-full body; with a very smooth, creamy/silky, and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is fantastic. Alcohol is very well hidden with light-moderate warming and zero booziness after the finish. Overall this is a world class imperial porter style. All around incredible complexity and perfect balance of dark/roasted malt, coconut/brown sugar, and bourbon barrel flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the enormous ABV. An insanely mind blowing offering. 1,795 characterssuperspak, Jan 09, 2016

22oz bottle poured into large snifter.
Looks thin on the pour. Black with a minimal chocolate colored cap of foam. Nose is outstanding! The taste is even better, just gushing with chocolate and coconut. The 15%ABV is very well hidden. A little thin, but nice for the style. This whopper of a beer will be on my radar for good. Probably my favorite new beer this year, and not a moment too soon to top that list! 425 charactersLloydDobler, Jan 01, 2016

A: Pours dark cola like color with a tan head, no head retention, no lacing, good amount of carbonation streaming up the sides, looks good. 
A: Sweet bourbon, vanilla, toasted coconut, macaroons, on the sweet side, hint of some roasted malts, no alcohol on the nose, smells great.
T: Like the nose, sweet bourbon with vanilla, toasted coconut, macaroons, alcohol is present but not overwhelming, hint of roasted malts, very drinkable, the alcohol becomes more noticeable as the beer warms, but this is very tasty.
M: Medium bodied mouthfeel with a semi-dry finish, good amount of carbonation.
O: This is really good, big flavors, on the sweet side, great mouthfeel, alcohol is there but it's still very drinkable, would definitely make this a yearly purchase if available in CA but it's not. 850 charactersBrolo75, Dec 26, 2015

Taste. Phenomenal. Nice blend of coconut, maple, caramel. Bourbon sweetness. I can see why some think this is too sweet but, I just think it awesome. Lol. Alcohol well masked.
Feel: Very slightly thin. But not too noticeable. Silky.
Overall: This beer is great. Seek out if you had not tried it. I prefer the 12oz format since a beer of this ABV should not be consumed in 22oz. Hahaha. Cheers! 539 characterssittinggc, Dec 09, 2015

Review #1100
The beer poured a murky medium brown. A bit thin for the style. The liquid was topped by a frothy, bubbly, one finger tall, khaki colored crown. The head fell pretty quickly to a thin cap of bubbles that transformed into a thick, lasting collar. Streaky lacing trickled along the glass.
The nose was outstanding. Really sweet and intense. Super bourbony but not at all boozy. Loads and loads of fresh vanilla extract and maple goodness. Coconut came also through strong. This had an almost candy or pastry-like quality to it. Rich with intense caramel notes. Good amount of brown sugar as well. The aroma became even more fragrant as it warmed.
The flavor profile closely mimicked the aroma. Rich and robust with a sweet caramel and roasted malt backbone. Hefty dose of maple and brown sugar sweetness. Loads of rich bourbon flavor but shockingly very little alcohol heat. 15% ABV? Are they for real? This might be one of the least boozy high ABV beers I have ever tried. Vanilla was noticeable but not as much as it was in the nose. Touch of alcohol heat in the finish. The vanilla and coconut came out more with time.
On the palate, the liquid was medium bodied. Definitely a bit thin for a beer of this magnitude. Creamy and slick with a moderate carbonation. The alcohol numbed the sides of my tongue.
Most 15% ABV beers are viscous, boozy monsters but No Rules is surprisingly neither. While this beer might not be super complex, it is both immensely flavorful and shickingly quaffable. How they managed to hide this beer's alcohol prowess is truly remarkable. 1,692 charactersDamian, Dec 01, 2015

Oatmeal colored head, frothy with lots of lace. Pitch-black body. 5
Smells sweet and nutty. Coconut is light and creamy. Chocolate and vanilla. Hints of coffee and alcohol. 4.25
Boozy coconut, dark fruit, dark chocolate, coffee and vanilla. Nice flavors but the alcohol is an unwelcome distraction. 4
Thick-bodied and creamy initially, before giving way to a solvent-like, thinner body. Heavy sweetness for most of the journey although there's some bitterness in the finish. 4
Great flavors but overwhelmed by the alcohol heat and occasional solvent flavors. 584 charactersONovoMexicano, Nov 28, 2015
4.42/5  rDev -0.5%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a night black color, with a surprisingly huge, bubbly mohagony head.
Smells of an earth supported, profound cinnamon spiciness, together with sweet, slightly wooden coconut, toasted pecans and a whiff of lemon peel. These aromas blend into burned toffee, tied together by bakers chocolate and raisins. Its sweet qualities turn quite distinct, topped off by molasses, which get balanced by a rich bourbon soaked appearance, adding vanilla and a warming punch to the nose.
Has a lower carbonation, with a luscious smoothness to it, showcasing the beers huge body beautifully, while finishing with a great blend of spicy, bourbon soaked truffles.
Mirrors the spicy truffle impression from the nose, while adding a fair amount of scorched malts and walnut shells to it. Its malt qualities are multi layered, very rich, to be able to balance the beers bourbon quality, revealing toffee, caramel and molasses, tied together by roasted coconut. Bourbon adds a flowery vanilla flavor, blending perfectly into the already established cinnamon woodeness, enriching the beer by a hot wood bark note, adding a pungent dryness to the sweetness. Finishes outstandingly smooth, with boozy, chocolate coated caramel and lots of whipped cream. 
Its smoothness balances the hot bourbon bite easily, while providing well fitting adjuncts, coming together due to a rich maltiness. While this is certainly a sipper, it reveals its huge abv only embedded in the warming, flowery Bourbon barrel. 1,482 charactersaleigator, Nov 28, 2015

Smell is mostly sweet, some bourbon smell. Taste hits the cinnamon for sure, but I don't get the coconut. Certainly very syrupy and sweet. The 15% is very well hidden, as it doesn't burn much at all. Overall an outstanding beer, although the mini snifter pour was plenty. 360 characters98green, Nov 15, 2015
4.62/5  rDev +4.1%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Pours a medium brown, that settles into the glass as a very dark brown with a pale tan head. The head settles very quickly and leaves a ring of thick bubbles around the edges of the glass. Aroma has sweet caramel, brown sugar and molasses, oaky wood, coconut, hints of boozy bourbon and notes of chocolate. Flavor is much of he same as the nose, caramel, bourbon, hints of coconut, chocolate. Very flavorful and sweet with a surprisingly low alcohol flavor. The feel is somewhat thick and low carbonation, moderately syrupy, but still big and drinkable. This is a very flavorful, very potent BA Porter that had big flavors and a huge nose. All in all a very good and memorable beer. 682 charactersstephenjmoore, Nov 14, 2015

Solid dark black with the faintest of garnet at the edges and a bubbly off white head that shows poor retention.

Smell:  Dark chocolate, cinnamon, vanilla, maple and Bourbon

Mouthfeel:  Full bodied with moderate carbonation and some warmth in the gullet
Overall:  I was really excited to find this on tap in my trip to Detroit; while there is a lot going, I found the beer to be too sweet for my palate and I didn't get much of the Vietnamese coffee - put this up next to the Vietnamese Speedway and you will see what I mean 719 charactersbrentk56, Nov 04, 2015

Thick black pour.  So much going on with the nose. Cinnamon, vanilla, nutmeg, booze, oak.  The taste is phenomanal.  Starts with a nice warming booze flavor, but not nearly like a shot.  Nutmeg, coconut, chocolate, oak, cinnamon send pleasure endorphins to the brain. So well balanced and so many flavors.  Thick mouthfeel which makes you just want to let this rest on your palate. Can not tell that this is 15%.  To me this beer trumps kbs which I also had today.  Just short of CBS in my mind, but a definite top 10 in my personal beer rankings. 703 charactershardysf, Oct 18, 2015

Solid body and carbonation but could use a touch more . 
Very impressive and well done beer that held up very nicely in a growler over 4 weeks. I hope they do this beer again in spite of the apparent hardship to produce . 480 charactersbelgbeerdrinker, Oct 16, 2015

Pour dark black. Minimal head. The nose is dominated by coconut, along with a latent sweetness & a touch of roast &/or burnt oak. Did you know Janet Jackson is up for the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame? She’s still hot. 
No Rules: a DUI waiting to happen. Alcohol flames the palate before subsiding to let a few other things pass (no Balrog). Big coconut notes, but I can’t tell if it’s riding over the bourbon or vice versa, but who cares? Mid-palate brings more joy: chocolate, molasses of the best kind, marshmallows, more heat, definite tugging. Thick, thicker, thickest. I’m sucking this down like a session porter. It is, right? 
This beer is certainly Jacksonesque (no, not Michael, knock it off). I’m eyeing my wife’s portion of this & thinking I should have taken this when she was out of town last week. Dammit. Believe the hype - this beer deserves it’s place among the elite. 1,055 charactersmaximum12, Oct 10, 2015

No Rules is certainly no exception. 
This beer is basically an unbalanced and overly boozy version of what a poor Dark Lord barrel-aged variant might taste like. Everything on the palate is heat and barrel, followed by an unrestrained sweetness. 
Future versions of this product may get better over time as the brewers figure out how to properly barrel-age the base beer and mellow out its sweetness, but as is, No Rules is simply another over-hyped beer. 557 charactersrodmanfor3, Oct 05, 2015

Major coconut on the nose...like really, if you like coconut, it doesn't get better than this. It pretty much overwhelms anything else in the aroma, but there are some traces of bourbon. As would be expected, there's a lot of toasted coconut in the taste as well, dark malt sweetness with some roast, notes of vanilla, neutral booze. Body was a little on the thin side, and kind of harsh/hot with booze. Decent, but kind of messy overall, but might be interesting with a little time on it, even if the coconut fades a bit. 626 charactersRifugium, Oct 03, 2015

4.71/5  rDev +6.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.7522oz bottle from LambicPentameter (thanks for hooking me up with this!). No discernible bottling date. Served in a Monday Night snifter. 
Pours a deep, dark espresso brown with an eighth finger cap of tan head. The bubbles fade away to a thin ring around the edges without depositing any lace. 
Huge, sweet nose of roast malt, lots of coconut, vanilla, sugar, burnt oak and faint coffee. Smells outstanding and that coconut keeps beckoning me to take another whiff. 
Flavors are incredibly rich and decadent. Huge coconut notes abound from start to finish backed by bourbon, vanilla, sugar, fudge, oak, sweetened creamed coffee and a surprisingly subtle alcohol heat.  All of the flavors work wonderfully together and help this huge beer go down with dangerous ease. Utterly delicious. 
Big, thick, sludgy feel with nice, soft carbonation. Coconut, bourbon and sugary vanilla coat the tongue for a rich, lingering finish. 
While I might debate calling this 15% abv barrel aged behemoth a porter, No Rules is freaking fantastic. Everything I look for in this style is here from the smell, the intense flavors and that wonderfully satisfying full body. This one is highly recommended and well worth some effort to acquire/ try. 1,230 charactersThickNStout, Sep 29, 2015

A - Dark coffee brown with a 1 finger light brown head. Fades into a thin ring and only leaves behind spotty lacing.
S - Quite sweet with plenty of cinnamon, maple, bourbon, vanilla, milk chocolate. Not much for roaste malt aroma or coffee, but it sure smells wonderful.
T - The initial flavor is maple sugar along with cinnamon. Plenty of coconut and chocolate as it warms along with the bourbon, vanilla and marshmallow. It is sweet, but not cloying in any way. Enjoyable sipper that will light up your taste buds. 
M - It is thin, but smooth and velvety. I prefer it this way because it keeps it easy to drink with the high ABV. 
O - No Rules... No Rules Man! Pretty awesome brew. 721 charactersRi0, Sep 27, 2015

A-  The label looks good, it's very obvious it's a Big Lebowski reference and it's very eye catching.  It poured a very dark brown almost black color that takes on more of dark brown hue when held to the light with a little under a fingers worth of creamy tan head that died down to a thin ring that stayed till the end and it left a little bit of patchy lacing behind.  This is a very good looking beer it's just how I expect an Imperial Porter to look.
S-  The aroma starts off with a lower amount of high sweetness that imparts a big maple syrup and brown sugar like aromas that go right into some big caramel, toffee and light butterscotch aromas that come together to make for a rich and decadent aroma.  Up next comes the barrel imparting some great coconut, oak, vanilla and bourbon like aromas without being overpowering.  Towards the end comes a nice chocolate and cocoa like aroma. with a noticeable alcohol aroma that isn't too boozy for being 15&.  This beer has a great aroma, it's pretty balanced.
T-  The taste seems to be similar to the aroma and it starts of with a higher amount of sweetness with those maple syrup and brown sugar flavors being the first to show up and the maple syrup sticks out the most this time.  Up next comes that same mixture of caramel, toffee and light butterscotch that I got in the aroma and goes right into the barrels which seem to show up just a little more than they did in the aroma and they impart the same aspects.  Towards the end comes some nice cocoa flavors and this times there's just a little bit of dark fruit flavors showing up.  On the finish there's no bitterness with sweetness and alcohol taking it's place, it's for sure a little boozy, but not that bad for 15%. This is a great tasting beer, but I think it would truly be world class if it was a little less sweet.
M-  A little smooth, a little cloying, on the very thick side of being medium bodied with a lower amount of medium carbonation.  The mouthfeel is very nice, but I wish it was a little less cloying.
Overall I thought this was a great beer and great example of the style, I didn't hear much about this beer till I saw it at the beer store and knowing my history with Perrin I knew there was a better chance that it would be a hit than a miss, thankfully I was right.  This beer had nice drinkability, but one glass would be my limit anymore than that would be overkill and because of the sweetness I don't think I would want to drink a full bottle.  What I like the most about this beer is how well all the different aspects came together, it just made for some great aromas and flavors.  What I like the lest about this beer was the sweetness, I think it needs to be toned down just a little.  I would for sure buy this beer again, I would be interested to see how it ages, but I think it's about as good as it's going to get right now.  I would for sure recommend this beer, if you like big bourbon barrel aged beers I think it's a must try.  All in all I was a little impressed with this beer, I thought it was going to be good, but it exceeded my expcatations it left me with a pretty tasty beer that I really enjoyed, but I can't help but think this beer would be perfect for a winter/ Holiday season release.  IT's my new favorite Bourbon barrel aged Imperial Porter, Arcadia's Shipwreck Porter held the crown for many years, but this beer takes the style to a whole new level and it's now my favorite of the style and my favorite beer from Perrin.    Great job guys, this beer can hold it's own against some of the better bourbon barrel aged beers, keep up the great work. 3,831 charactersStoutHunter, Sep 26, 2015

Look: Black coffee with a brief bit of bubbles that gave way to a high proof sheen.
Smell:  Bourbon, coconut and vanilla.
Taste: Tasted cold and the cinnamon really slaps your palate. Allowed to warm for 30 minutes and the coconut came out more. Taste of Figs and dark fruit also hit the palate. Very interesting porter.
Feel: Lighter than I expected. Boozy but no too boozy. Almost like a port with dark chocolate. 
Overall: a great Porter with interesting dark fruit flavors. If that cinnamon fell off a little more and the coconut was more prominent I would have liked this one more. Definitely suggest getting it if you can. 679 charactersMatthewHopHead, Sep 21, 2015

S - Bourbon, cocoa, milk chocolate, vanilla. 
T - Very unique flavor:  Milk chocolate, cocoa, vanilla, bourbon, light oak, and a cinnamon-like spice quality.  Most impressive, for 15% there's little to no alcohol burn and the warming is ever so slight on the way down.
M - Heavy, thick, full bodied - velvet-like, slippery, sticky.  Coats the mouth with spicy bourbon and chocolate.
O - This is an outstanding beer. 497 charactersjzeilinger, Sep 20, 2015

So I did the right thing and followed the rules. The beer poured out black, there wasn't much else to look at, not really all that carbonated or anything. The smell is pretty good but the taste is where this one really shines. Lots of bourbon and an assortment of sweet sugary flavors in there as well. It's got huge flavors. The feel is decent, I'm torn that I feel it's too thin but it's supposed to be a porter so that keeps things in check. Overall I would like to have this one again some time. 576 charactersKnapp85, Sep 20, 2015

Nose is all cinnamon. Cinnamon toast crunch. 
Flavor is very complex. Tons of cinnamon. Most I have ever had. The coconut hides in the background. Great bourbon and oak flavors. Vanilla. A little heat. 
Medium bodied. Medium carbonation. Ends with a little roast and chocolate,
Overall, maybe a tad high on the cinnamon but it was unique and I really enjoyed it. Highly recommend. 418 charactersmothman, Sep 19, 2015

Poured black with no transparency in the glass, and a quarter inch head that recedes quickly. Smell was chocolate, vanilla, dark fruit and coconut, with an overall sweetness.  Taste was similar, I got a milk chocolate up front with a nice vanilla, dark fruit, and coconut followed by a little bit of oak and alcohol spice. Feel was a little light, but it does have some heft from the coconut, with low carb. Overall this is a very tasty beer, perhaps a little bit of over hype, but definitely worth having. 549 charactersOneEye78, Sep 18, 2015

Pours the expected deep brown though the nice, wispy mocha-tan head that rings the glass was a nice touch, and an unexpected one. So...made with coconut eh? My favorite "dark beer" adjunct, so let's see what this nose is all about. Gadzooks! An overwhelmingly dominant coconut presence, they weren't lying! Liquid Almond Joy poured into a vanilla sugar cookie and then soaked overnight in bourbon barrels. Did I mention coconut? and vanilla? Gadzooks, I say again.
The taste is everything you want it to be, gloriously sugary milk chocolate with coconut flake, and more than a hint of marshmallow and vanilla. Excellent barrel presence! Chewy, thick mouthfeel, and thankfully despite the obvious sugary aspect to the beer, it never becomes cloying, even as it warms. Now, it is 15% ABV, so it's not surprising when the booze makes its presence known on the backend of each sip, providing a nice warming aspect. Certainly can't drink more than 1 in a sitting, but taking down the 12oz. solo isn't an issue at all. This beer is absolutely delicious, and I'm so happy I have 3 more. 1,147 charactersmarkgugs, Sep 17, 2015

Pours a dark brown translucent body with cherry highlights. Little brown head and a ring of retention once it settles.
I had to let this sit out for 30 min for the aromas to really open up. Big vanilla, bourbon, coconut, milk chocolate, boozy aromas come through.
On the tongue is a heavy whiskey booziness that gives way to nice vanilla and sweet caramel notes. Slight coconut but not nearly as much as I was expecting. Finish is roasty and slightly bitter. Body is thin with low carbonation.
Great beer, tons of flavor, a little boozy but overall good 625 charactersgcamparone, Sep 11, 2015

Tastes follows the nose, but not as boozy as alcohol is well hidden in the flavor. Again, dominant coconut, but with the bourbon barrel making it little acidic/sour-ish, the flavor reminded me slightly of aged/old/spoiled coconut (blame it on my growing up on coconut). Mouthfeel is rather thin, but I guess that's what you can expect out of a porter. 454 charactersmythaeus, Sep 09, 2015

There is great coconut and bourbon notes in the aroma and there is some heat in the flavor. The coconut is there but not even close to Proprietors. I wish there had been a little more in terms of either chocolate or coffee from the grains as oppose to burnt grains. I did enjoy this beer and it is definitely above average for a porter (I hesitate to call this a porter, it's a stout). Worth trying but not worth giving anything greater the a great shelf beer for. 525 charactersjvillefan, Sep 08, 2015

The aroma is vanilla, coconut, slight marshmallow, similar in aroma to VR and FO. A bit more complex than VR. The taste is coconut, chocolate, oak, bourbon like notes, cola and slight caramel as it warms. The body is thick and full. It doesn't taste anything like 15%. This is a banger. 388 charactersKVNBGRY, Sep 07, 2015

Serious appreciation to Beergorilla for the opportunity to try this beer. 
A:  Thick, opaque dark brown to a lighter brown cola color as my glass empties. A light brown head that disappears. Minor amount of lacing, but what's there is syrupy.
S:  Vanilla, coffee, bourbon, dates and a touch of cinnamon.
T:  Vanilla, coffee, bourbon, with sweet coconut on the finish. A bit of woody oak and nut on the finish. Spectacular. 
M:  Low carbonation. Slick. Makes my lips sticky. 
D:  At 15% you could not find yourself a more drinkable beer. It's super smooth, there's no unwanted bitterness, but it's not overly sweet.  Big bold flavors. 673 charactersantott0523, Sep 07, 2015

L- Pretty dark, some light on the edges, small light brown head that dissipates quickly. 
S- Cinnamon, dark dried fruits, brown sugar, toasted coconut, light bit of dark chocolate, some alcohol but not too much. 
T- Similar to aroma, like bourbon soaked fruit cake. some have been saying it's a bit too sweet but I like sweeter bourbon barrel beers. Very smooth for being 15% and fresh. 
F- A little bit thinner than I was expecting for the abv but still good. 
O- Really a great beer and I'm glad I got to find a bottle at a restaurant, up there with some of the best bourbon imperial beers out there. 645 charactersPaulyB83, Sep 01, 2015

Pours rather thin looking, not incredibly lacy and low (but good) carb with no head. I did poor this cold out of the fridge, roughly upper 30's so the smell was light, some coconut, some chocolate but it was hard to get a lot. Taste was overly sweet, real solid mix of coconut, barrel, maple and cocoa but honestly, too much maple really killed it though. Good mouth, loved the coconut addition just wished it was less sweet. The alcohol was very very well hiddent but don't think time will help this any. I will try this one again at a warmer temp to see if that helps, and I'm sure it will. 661 charactersEyePeeAyBryan, Aug 31, 2015
4.15/5  rDev -6.5%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Enjoyed out of a 22 oz brown bomber with no bottling date that I noticed, but given the style and the fact that this was only released a few weeks ago, I'm not terribly concerned. Time to see if this one lives up to the crazy buzz that's been surrounding it--poured into a large brandy-style snifter.
Appearance (4.25) - Pours a dark cola color from the bottle that becomes a fairly matte black-brown once it is all collected in the glass. If I hold it up to the light, I can see those same cola colored notes on the edges of the darker body. Atop sits a finger toasted marshmallow colored head that looks somewhat pillowy and only retains for a minute or so before turning into a ringlet around the edges of the glass. No lacing to be seen whatsoever, but some faint legs are present for a bit when the glass is tipped.
Smell (4.25) - There is a considerable sweetness on the smell that contains therein pleasant notes of coconut, brown sugar, and faint cinnamon. I'm really enjoying the gentle intertwining of the coconut and cinnamon, which both come through in a subtle and balanced manner, but I must admit a little trepidation at the fact that I can't really detect any alcohol (for a 15% beer no less!) or the contrapuntal notes of roast and bittersweet chocolate that are quintessential to the porter style and might serve to offset the sweeter elements. But for now, I'll put such worries aside and enjoy the delicious smell of this dessert beer.
Taste (4.0) - Initially, the wonderful balance of coconut and cinnamon that were previewed by the smell makes for a great first impression. Coconut and cinnamon are two of my favorite ingredients in a beer, but I think this is the first time I'd ever had them side by side in one beer. However, as I work my way through the glass I begin to get fatigued by the increasingly cloying sweetness that I can only assume comes from the use of the turbinado sugar. It seems my initial reservations about the smell lacking any elements of booziness or roasted char flavors have been realized, as I really want another flavor profile to cut through the confectionary melange from the coconut, sugar and cinnamon. The sweeter profiles all but drown out the barrel-aging; I'm sure there are some notes of vanilla and caramel, but it's hard to pick them out of the crowd. With some warmth, the sweetness is tempered a bit as the booze comes through more, but it's still sweet enough that I decide to cap my bottle to finish the second half the following night.
Mouthfeel (4.25) - Carbonation is on the low side of moderate and the body is medium-heavy in thickness. I wish it were a bit thicker, because I can't help but wonder if it would support the sweetness a bit better. The end result is a nice feel that gives the impression of slickness at times.
Overall (4.25), a beer that I enjoyed quite a bit while simultaneously coming away disappointed. It starts off so well, but becomes maddeningly monotonous as you work through the bottle. 22 oz was simply too much for me to finish in one sitting, but I can imagine that this would be a huge hit at settings where you only get 5-6 oz at a time. There are some excellent things going on in this beer, but it certainly was a lesson for me in Too Much Of A Good Thing. I will definitely be sharing my other bottles rather than taking them to the face like I tried to do with this one. 3,383 charactersLambicPentameter, Aug 31, 2015

Thin
Sweet maple rich sip after sip, slight alcohol burn after each taste. We started really cold and it locked the sweetness up and let the bourbon, vanilla-oak combination come out more and then as it warmed, all maple sweetness with heat on the finish.
If this was thick, it would be deadly! All around really thankful I got to try this hype train! 400 charactersfloridadrift, Aug 24, 2015
4.86/5  rDev +9.5%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5Poured into a tulip from a 22oz.
Dark brown almost black under 1.5 inches of dark tan that falls with some lace.
Boozy bourbon with vanilla and wood.  Roasted notes of coffee with dark sugars, cinnamon,Amber honey and chestnuts.  Outstanding!
The taste follows much of the nose with the bourbon barrel notes of booze and vanilla, dark sugars and coffee in harmony with coconut, cinnamon spice flows into a vanilla bourbon finish that is warm and lingering.
The mouth borders on stout territory so much that I'm starting to question its designation as porter, but that's just a minor detail in the face of a very big and complex beer that deserves much of the hype that follows in its wake. 693 charactersypsifly, Aug 24, 2015

Similar body to the rest of the Killing Craft series from Perrin, thin with lots of carbonation to make up for it. More body and less sugar would've made this much more enjoyable. Good but not the amazing beer others have hyped it up to be in my opinion. Definitely better barrel aged offerings coming out of Michigan. 429 charactersgashmoney, Aug 23, 2015

Excellent nose. Sugars, masked spices and subtle coconut. 
Mouthfeel is also stout like. Coats nicely but not overpowering. 
Taste is very good when cold, but spices are muted and there's little coconut present. As it warms, the spices come out, but the alcohol gets a bit Acetyl and hot. I never get a ton of coconut out of this beer. 
Overall, it's a very good ba porter. Will be interesting to revisit in 6 months to see how the heat changes. 492 charactersmxracercam, Aug 22, 2015

5/5  rDev +12.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5From 22oz bottle in a snifter. 
L: extremely dark brown with thin khaki head. Minimal lacing, no carbonation. 
S: strong bourbon, cinnamon and vanilla. Little nutty, maybe some carmalized brown sugar. There some whiff of sweet cacao in there. You can expect this going to be very sweet. Once I warms up the maple becomes dominate. 
T: sweet but not too sweet. Perrin did a great job here on balancing all the flavors together. This is a very complex and strong beer that's hard not to drink fast. Everything goes together very well. The vanilla and cinnamon taste is stronger than the coconut which is very hidden and only detectable when it warms up. 
F: surprisingly thin, but makes sense for a porter, which in this case is kind of arguably misleading. Heats show up in the finish after this beer warms up. 
O: This is a magnificent beer. One of the best BA beers I had. Completely understand the hype when an already great brewery makes a world class stout, which brings me to my next point on the classification of this beer. First of all, calling this an imperial porter is like calling an ipa an imperial pale ale. Historically there was a style called "stout porter" for strong porters which became known now as stouts. I think the reason behind perrin naming this a porter is because it's easier to be called the best porter than the best stout, especially in a state that makes kbs, cbs, black note and plead the 5th. Nevertheless, this beer is going to be one of the most sought after beer in the few next year. It's already hard to get and sold out at the brewery under one hour. 1,596 charactersBIN29, Aug 21, 2015

4.79/5  rDev +7.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.75No Rules Vietnamese Porter. Imperial porter aged in Heaven Hill and Four Roses bourbon barrels for nine months with coconut, cinnamon, and raw cane sugar, then blended with maple syrup post-barrel.  Have had this on draft and out of the bottles as well, there's no discernible difference that I'm able to pick up.
Appearance: Black as black can be.
Smell: Sweet coconut, booze, a bit of cinnamon.
Taste: Coconut, cinnamon, and sticky maple syrup.  Booze comes through in flavor only, there's no burn to this beast.
Mouthfeel: My only criticism is it's a tad thinner than I typically like my BA stouts (yes, I know it's a "porter", but Imperial Porter = Stout, if we're being honest), but it's a personal preference thing and nothing against the way it was made.
Overall: A stunningly complex beer with layers upon layers of flavor that finishes soft, smooth, and zero alcohol burn for being 15%. Wow. 905 charactersmjshearer1, Aug 18, 2015

4.21/5  rDev -5.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25650ml bottle. Served in a snifter glass.
Pours a dark brown body that is not quite dark black, but close enough. Minimal half finger brown head that dies out fairly quickly. No lacing. Smells of bourbon, chocolate, minimal vanilla, oak, fair bit of cinnamon, mild coffee bean. On the sweeter side with a good whiskey presence. Flavour is similarly cinnamon-forward, bourbon, smoky sweetness, oak, raw vanilla bean, espresso, milk chocolate, dark chocolate. I don't know about coconut, but the cinnamon is definitely there. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, a bit thin for a 15% beer, but still a solid body nevertheless. Fair amount of carbonation. Sticky, slick coating mouthfeel. Definitely a sipper because of that, but not because it's 15%. There isn't that much heat, just more bourbon flavouring than any kind of fusel. Overall, an interesting BA imperial porter with some adjunct flavours to it, decent execution. I'm not sure what adjuncts are actually used in this, but I definitely got bourbon barrels and cinnamon, perhaps vanilla bean. Not sure what else was used. Definitely a more than solid BA porter, though very, very sweet. 1,136 charactersStevedore, Aug 18, 2015

4.75/5  rDev +7%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75On tap at Perrin.
I was skeptical of this as I've not really ever been impressed with a Perrin beer but this is just excellent. Smell is vanilla, cake frosting, maple syrup, cinnamon, dark malts. Really kicks in as it warms up and seemed to beg me to keep sipping. 
Taste ALMOST follows through... at times it seemed like it was kicking on all cylinders and other times kept me wanting more, but this is a nitpick that is almost not worth mentioning, I'm getting tons of coconut and cinnamon with the bourbon alongside being just about perfect, not too faint or too boozy. Finish is long lasting dark, malty umami that was almost too much at times but for the most part came across really well. 
The criticism of mouthfeel I keep reading is strange to me as I was glad it wasn't any thicker, it seemed to me to be the perfect vehicle to deliver the flavors, especially with the long lasting umami finish it just really works. 
After Perrins opening I had high hopes but their beers just didn't deliver. Kill em all was amongst the worst barrel aged beers I've ever had so I was ready to write this one off too; really glad I didn't. The complete package is something really unique that I don't think I've had before in a BA stout. The mentioning of this in the same league as CBS and BCBS doesn't seem like overkill to me. Really hoping this is a sign of more great things to come at Perrin. 1,395 characterstotalbangover, Aug 13, 2015

To me the 15% is well hidden & the flavors meld together nicely.  I didn't get much coconut but as it warmed I got more but it's still an ancillary piece of the puzzle.  The barrel definitely isn't in your face but mixes nicely with the other flavors to compliment instead of take over.  With this being a porter it is thinner than I would like but that's pretty standard 405 characterscore42, Aug 12, 2015

Keep in mind that this is a porter, so the thickness and mouthfeel of a heavy imperial stout isn't there, but as a porter, it does not disappoint. A bit of a heavier porter, smooth, nice carb. As for being 15%, you would never guess it as the bourbon/heat is very well hidden. Great nose on this in the glass, and as it gradually warms, the taste provides more & more complimenting notes of vanilla, slight bourbon, coconut, maple, cinnamon....DAMN GOOD! Most definitely one of my favorite beers of recent releases. 649 charactersbeer-wheezy, Aug 09, 2015

Smell:  Bourbon, Vanilla, Cinnamon, Maple, Chocolate and Earthy Coconut. 
Taste:  Vanilla and cinnamon up front with maple bourbon warmth, chocolate in the middle and finishes with coconut.  Alcohol is well masked for 15%.  A bit sweet but not too much.
Feel:  A little thin, but it is a porter.  The big flavor tricks you into expecting a stout type mouth feel.
Overall:  Perrin's best beer.  This tops the Malted Milk Ball Porter which I would still drink if it was still around.  This one is crazy good right now, but can't wait to get a year on it.  It's a special beer that will be remembered for years to come.  Too bad distro is so small. 671 charactersmarcalan, Aug 08, 2015

4.19/5  rDev -5.6%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25So I traded for several bottles already as I believed it was right up my alley. 
This beer is really good, but not as epic as I was hoping for. 
Mouthful is medium, not nice and viscous as something like bourbon county, but it doesn't ruin the experience by any means. 
I get decent bourbon and good coconut and TONS of cinnamon, the adjuncts are a bit too much for me. I'll enjoy the bottles I traded for, but this was going to be my decider as to whether I would seek more out, I won't. 
15% is well hidden. 510 characterswhiskey, Aug 08, 2015
4.71/5  rDev +6.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Huge thanks to rudzud for the epic share.
Pours a mild fizzy darker colored head that fades quickly, nice long legs, almost pitch black color. 
Nose is very dense and complex, dark choc almost fudgey, hint of nutty toffee and caramel, big vanilla bourbon, bourbon barrel, and hints of nougat, hint of candied raisin, the nutty aroma blends into a mild smooth coffee, nutty slight earthy smooth coffee, then suddenly a huge maple candy, back into cocoa fudge and coconut, then an earthy nutty Vietnamese coffee with a creamy iced coffee thing. 
Taste brings big layered flavours again, different chocolates, creamy fudgey cocoa, with bakers choc, and creamy choc inside a lindor truffle. Into nice bourbon barrel juice, vanilla barrel, nice vanilla and some coconut as well. Hint bitter roast, touch earthy hop, creamy milk choc. Then coffee, mild smooth nutty coffee, Vietnamese like coffee I think. Then big maple flavor, maple cream. Nice caramel and nutty toffee. Hint bitter roast later, mild sweetness on the finish with tons of maple lingering, caramel, nice coconut and cocoa, vanilla barrel and bourbon lingering. Semi sweet. 
Mouth is on the heavier side, fuller, little syrupy, hint of booze, decent but lighter carb. 
Overall very nice, little sweet and syrupy, tons of nice maple, great bourbon barrel and caramel candy, etc, mild coffee wish it was a bit more, cocoa was nice but wish it was more too, but I'm nitpicking, it was an awesome beer. 1,463 charactersjlindros, Aug 08, 2015
4.71/5  rDev +6.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Big thanks to Max for hooking me up with bottle. Shared with JLindros.
A - Poured into a Kate the Great tulip a nice dark almost black hue with a thin mocha head that fades to leave a thin mocha halo. Great legs. 
S - Aromas of loads of chocolate, some type of bourbon note, very light coffee notes, loads of coconut from the barrel, lots of maple syrup. Really complex, really smooth. Lots of great aromatics that fade in and out with each sniff. 
T - Taste is loads of bourbon and chocolate, then loads of coconut barrel notes with some roasty coffee before WHAM maple syrup. The chocolate is really layered and deep with awesome bourbon and barrel notes. The maple comes out as soon as one swallows. This beer really pops as it warms, loads of barrel, chocolate, maple, coconut and coffee. Really impressive. 
M - Mouthfeel is lightly carbonated, little slick, alcohol hidden well though. 
O - Overall this beer was really tasty, super complex with amazing chocolate and bourbon notes. This is definitely a shocker. Wow. Just wow.

4.76/5  rDev +7.2%look: 4.25 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Great and unique, two of the hardest combined qualities to find.  Don't pass this one up folks!
A: Pours a deep amber red and fades to black as the glass fills.
S: Huge coconut with some vanilla. Hard to tell if I'm getting bourbon too.
T: Very decadent.  More than I'm used to, but not in a bad way.   Again coconut with vanilla.  Very light on the bourbon.  It is hard to believe this is 15%, even after rolling it on my tongue.
F: Thin as you would expect from a porter, not heavy on carb.
O: Fantastic.  The small criticism I would have is much like anything decadent, too much isn't necessarily a good thing.  Perrin, if you are listening, keep this in 12oz format and ditch the bombers. 693 charactersLazhal, Aug 07, 2015

4.98/5  rDev +12.2%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5Take a back seat, coffee, because this beer is driven by strong, distinct notes of cinnamon hearts, bourbon, candied pecans, maple, brown sugar, gingerbread, cookie dough, raisin, Fig Newtons and coconut. And no - I'm not referring to subtle nuances, nor am I throwing around fanciful descriptor words just to beef up this review or hype up this beer. This beer deserves any and all hype it is given, and those flavours are all there.
Were I to dream up "the perfect beer", it would be this one - though perhaps with a more full-bodied, sticky mouthfeel. That said, this is a porter, not an imperial stout, and so its lighter body might be expected.
If you're looking for a thick, creamy beer, move along. It's the complex, layered flavour profile that makes this masterful offering from Perrin a standout beer that is well worth seeking out. 
I guarantee you will not be disappointed. 888 charactersECBS, Aug 04, 2015

4.97/5  rDev +11.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A BIG thanks goes out to a dear friend who graciously got us  some bottles of this special release !!!!
   I normally 'pass' on Porters as I prefer richer stouts, but he was a SAINT to highly recommend and get us this gem !!!!
My review :   Wow, Perrin obviously followed NO RULES when they created this luscious, unctuous "porter".  
 The category of Porter does not do justice to this rich, creamy  libation that has vaulted itself easily into my top five favorite beers !
    I expected a beer with a 'thinner' mouth feel as porters tend to be to me, but this sublime concoction goes down like the finest rich stout on the block.  Obviously this comes from the 15 percent ABV. WHEW.
       The first few sips were full of cinnamon, maple  and bourbon ( and did I mention unctuousness? HA)    As it warmed up a bit, big notes of coconut and chocolate fudge came on full steam.  All this rides on a big creamy boozy undertone.   A great beer for sharing.  
  I am very impressed with this offering from Perrin! 1,012 charactersLauraTheExplorer, Aug 01, 2015

4.88/5  rDev +9.9%look: 4.25 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75This beer pours like a heavy porter. It looks black in the glass, but is a little thinner than a stout would be. The nose is incredible. Heavy barrel, whiskey and coconut aromas. The taste is sweet, chocolate, coconut, vanilla, and a hint of maple to go with a whole lot of booze. The mouthfeel was perfect for the style. Excellent beer. 337 charactersJefferyLaGrow, Jul 31, 2015
4.85/5  rDev +9.2%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75One of the better beers at the Ypsilanti Summer Beer Fest.  Very strong sweetness and booze on the nose.  Taste was pretty similar.  Overall I'd say this was a lot like Dark Lord, but better and little less sweet.
Second tasting was from the bottle and was even better. The coconut really dominated and made me up my rating. Still slightly sweet for me, the only thing keeping me from making this a 5.0. 404 characterslinnymtu, Jul 29, 2015

4.71/5  rDev +6.1%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Got a bottle of this prior to release about a week ago. I opened it with a group of friends and split it up between a set of 4oz flight flutes after being held around 45 degrees. It poured a dark brown with minimal head. Strong vanilla oak on the nose and possibly maple. Flavor was delicious, surprisingly heavy for a porter, and had similar tasting properties to what was experienced from the scent. This was aged in the same Buffalo Trace PVW barrels that held their Kill Em All Imperial Stout previously.
Definitely worth trying. 533 charactersBristonian, Jun 08, 2015
