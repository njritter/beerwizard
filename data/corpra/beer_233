L- Thin soapy white head that stands 1 finger width tall,with moderate retention and sticky lacing.Deep juicy pineapple colored body,with low clarity,and distorted light showing through the glass.Low amount of carbonation,heavy amount of sediment.
S- On the nose I get heavy amounts of tropical fruit flavors,pineapple and mango in the lead,with slight grapefruit and pine,balanced by bready biscuit malts.
T- The palate follows the nose with tropical fruits up front,clean dank pine in the middle,and sweet bready biscuit malts on the back end.
F- The mouth feel is medium heavy with a chalky texture.Moderate amount of oxidation on the tongue,with a dry finish.
O- Very good IPA,perfect balance of fruit and pine.I will look forward to drinking this again,and recommend to all the hop heads. 877 charactersDraconusDesanctus666, May 28, 2017

L: Color is exactly like unfiltered creamed honey with a small, quickly fading white head.
S: Grapefruit, resiny hops, slight maltiness. Decent, but not strong.
T: Everything from the smell, but balanced and smooth. Easy drinking, with slight bitter aftertaste, but nothing that screams unique.
F: Love the slick, robust, unfiltered mouthfeel. A bit more carbonation than I expected from the head.
O: Enjoyable but not particularly memorable. At 8% ABV it's hardly a DIPA, and it drinks more like an IPA than a DIPA. 595 characterse_oly, May 24, 2017

4.47/5  rDev +1.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Canned 04/12/17, it pours (you guessed it) cloudy gold orange color with a foamy 2 finger off white head that was full of bubbles, fading very slowly and leaving good spotty lacing. The second can of the night left much better lacing and a foamy layer on top. Classic New England IPA looks.
Smells of grapefruit rind and pithy lemon up front with orange peel, tangerine, mango, fresh squeezed orange juice and a punch bowl of tropical fruit. The malt backbone jumps in right away with toasted grains and graham cracker, followed by some caramel, piney hops, musty grapes, light peppery spices and floral notes like dry floral hops.
Tastes of wet citrus hops and fresh squeezed orange juice up front followed by the same hoppy lineup as the nose: lemon, grapefruit, blood orange, tangerine, pineapple, melon and then dank piney hop notes, herbal accents like tea leaf, peppery spices and floral hops. It finishes with toffee, buttery cracker, toasted grains and sweet malt. Very well balanced with a mild bitterness, this goes down very smooth and easy, hiding the 8% ABV masterfully. A lot of fruit to take in all at once, but it's a very tasty and almost refreshing DIPA that still packs a punch.
Big thanks to "Boccu" for waiting in line up at the brewery and bringing back a great haul to Long Island. 1,307 charactersCHickman, Apr 21, 2017

Every once and awhile I come across one of these bright hoppy IPAs that I just can't get over the oniony taste this is one of them! The Only Trillium to date that I get it from. It was a decent beer in all other aspects. Medium body that finished dry. 424 charactersMFMB, Apr 19, 2017

S: Very tropical, little bit a citrus, picked out the pineapple as a biggest sent
T: Still pick up on that tropical from the smell,  pineapple hints of mango, with a nice bitterness to it. Not overly hoppy like a West Coast IPA, even though I really like those as well.
F: Very creamy, smooth, awesome mouthfeel. It leaves a feel on your pallet drawing you in for more, and craving the next sip.
Overall, I think this beer was very well done. I loved it form the first sniff at the crack of the can to the last sip. I want to thank @paresis for the trade on this! This was awesome! 659 characterschitownfanatic21, Apr 01, 2017

This one features Galaxy, Citra, and Columbus hops. Has the expected appearance of opaque juice, like pineapple or grapefruit juice, that is. Aromas of tropical citrus are followed by a splash of fresh juice with lots of orange, brighter moments of something vaguely lemony, and a finer thread of something akin to wine grapes. Tingly, bright, zesty, tangy - medium-light feel, the hum of carbonation - another killer beer for sure. 506 charactersGreywulfken, Feb 24, 2017

Nose is grassy & lemony. I've let it warm a bit before diving in, so was kind of hoping for more from this DIPA.
Taste is the juice bomb it appears to be. I am not getting big tropical anything, More citrussy. But really very good.
Finish is crisp, and remarkably smooth. 
Overall, this is a superb beer. I hope I get more of the tropical notes on the remaining beers in this 4-pack, but 8% was never more crushable. 536 charactersnuggetlover, Feb 11, 2017

Pours a pale straw color, almost opaque.  Solid one-finger head with nice lacing, settles down fast.  I love this look.  Unfiltered opaqueness draws me in.
Aroma is moderately fragrant with lemon, grapefruit and dank grass.  It is missing the tropical fruit smell that so many of their other IPAs have (don't worry - they come in with the taste).
Mouth feel has a zing of carbonation which I happen to like, a bit creamy smooth.  It is lacking a malty depth
Taste is very pleasantly hop-forward, continuing the aroma but adding strong hints of orange and other tropical fruit.  I call that a win.  Malt is missing for the most part though a caramel malt laces into the background
Overall this is a strange DIPA if you are looking for depth of malt - though this should be expected if you are having the average Trillium offering.  I think this is behind the various downgrades.  The fact they didn't change the playbook for the double come as no surprise.  Otherwise it is a stunningly delicious juice bomb, slightly more carbonated than the IPAs they make (which is refreshingly good).  For me this is a "wow" beer and fits all my desires for the NE IPA.  I seriously wish I had bought more of it on the last beer run. 1,265 charactersdigboy, Feb 04, 2017

Aroma is somewhat muted, but I do get some generic citrus notes plus a touch of melon. Somewhat dank. Flavor completely  lacks malt character. Hops are citrusy (lemon, orange, and a little lime) but not strong at all, kinda spritzy and thin. Mouth feel is too close to seltzer...refreshing but too thin for a DIPA. Overall it drinks like a session IPA. For a DIPA I want some thing that doesn't taste like its 4.5% and it needs some malt character. Not a bad beer, just not good for the DIPA style. 574 charactersjbertsch, Jan 27, 2017

4.11/5  rDev -6.8%look: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Poured into a Trillium tulip glass.
Pours a cloudy, fresh squeezed orange juice color. Minimal head that goes away quickly with a bit of lacing on the edges.
Bright citrus notes and tropical fruits on the nose. Bit of sweetness in the aroma as well.
First sip is big orange flavor and orange peels. Bit of bitterness but more on the sweet side. Some mango can be tasted and grapefruit lingers after. Definitely a big juice bomb. There is some yeast flavor and as it warms there are notes of cracker from the malts.
Bit of a medium body with some stickiness to it. Very light carbonation.
It was like drinking a big glass of juice. An adult version of juice. Very tasty and almost forgot I was drinking a beer. At 8% you gotta be careful not to forget. I really wanted something more of a complex smell from this DIPA but all I got was oranges. When this comes back around I'll be making sure I pick up some more. Trillium never ceases to amaze me. 952 charactersGimmeASchlitz, Dec 30, 2016

3.97/5  rDev -10%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4This is a decent double IPA from Trillium, but not the best. It has the look of all of their lightly hazy doubles, and it is a decent beer. The smell to me is like ocean water, but I can't tell if thats because there's oysters on the label or if its reality! It taste decent, its hoppy and tangy, maybe tangerine. Mouthfeel is pretty standard, fairly dry finish. Overall a decent double, but I would take uppercase over it anyway. not to mention a few other of their DDH streets. 479 charactersJam23, Dec 04, 2016

Guava and mango on the taste with apricot, orange and white grape juice following with a dank, earthy, slightly piney finish and hints of stone fruits. Very tropical and juicy, but not one note.
Medium bodied, crisp clean, NO TRACE OF ALCOHOL which is always impressive! Moderate bitterness and carbonation.

A: Surprisingly, this NE IIPA from the kings of the style does not pour completely opaque, instead opting for only a slightly hazy, brilliant golden-orange color. Two-and-a-half fingers of meringue-like head sits atop and has really nice retention. Lacing is equally impressive. There are obvious particles floating within, bounced around by the lazy-yet-plentiful carbonation. Per style, it should really be a bit hazier, but otherwise this is perfect. 4.75/5
A: Mango, orange, papaya, tangerine, lime, pineapple, and peach all burst forth from the glass in constant waves. Underneath lies a weedy dankness and a little alcohol sweetness. No real malt aromas are noticeable, but the sheer complexity of the hops (and probably fruity ale yeast contributions) really makes this incredible. The alcohol presence seems a bit much for only 8%, however. 4.5/5
T: Plenty of the same tropical-heavy fruits of the aroma, plus a great and very welcome contribution of juicy and bitter red grapefruit. Melon shows up toward the end of the flavor with the dank and pithy bitterness, along with a little indiscriminate herbaceousness. Malt sweetness is unnoticeable since it blends imperceptibly with the hops and creates a wonderful juiciness. Again, there is an alcoholic note on the end that is slightly unwelcome due to the relatively low ABV and how well it is hidden in other beers of similar ABV; this is a minor gripe, however. 4.75/5
M: Medium, slick, soft, and creamy are all applicable terms here. Carbonation is natural and soft, perhaps a little on the low end but not at all in a bad way. Dryness is slight, leaving the finish somewhat sticky and syrupy, making the beer seem much bigger than it is. This may be a bit of a flaw, but it somehow does not seem as detrimental as it could be in other beers. 4.25/5
O: This is a fantastic IIPA from perhaps the best brewer of this style. While it is not perfect, it does approach that and belongs in the conversation for the best to come out of the movement. There is so much juicy complexity that it is almost overwhelming, and it is almost perfectly balanced with the dankness that shows up later. It is truly remarkable how well Trillium integrates the overt hoppiness with the malts in a way that they worth together rather than being somewhat separate entities as in some other NE IPAs. Equally remarkable is how they wring unique flavors out of very similar, Galaxy-dominated hop bills. Pair with The Wonder Years "The Upsides" for being awesome but not quite game-changing. 4.5/5 2,556 charactersTHANAT0PSIS, Oct 22, 2016

Nose is citrusy, and a hint of something sweet that I can't put my finger on, but gun to my head I would say orange juice. Juice bomb taste with bitterness at the end. Good carbonation, and another very solid beer from Trillium. 341 charactersjphipps83, Oct 21, 2016
3.98/5  rDev -9.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 416oz undated can (ink smudged)
Pours hazy gold with a minor head and barely a trace of lacing and no retention. Aromatics are subdued for a Trillium. Hints of pineapple and mildly dank. Light tropical fruit. Medium bodied and a bit syrupy.  A bit grainy on the palate with pineapple pith and grapefruit. Finishes with a lingering bitterness and fading fruit.
A departure from all the other Trilliums I've tried. Lacking the fresh, juicy hops and smooth bitterness as usual and a bit stale. 491 charactersbrewandbbq, Oct 21, 2016

Smell - Slightly juicy aroma. Mild mango and lesser citrus. 
Taste - Follows the nose. Not much punch, but juicy with mango notes, lesser citrus, some mild pineapple zing, and a hint of pine and pith in the finish. Malts are beneath, but hit on some doughy bread character. Finish is lightly bright citrus and some fair white grape character.
Mouthfeel - Medium-bodied with moderate carbonation. Smooth, and quite drinkable. 
Overall - A pretty good NE DIPA. I don't know. Maybe the Yojo has spoiled me, but I didn't find this particuarly amazing. 760 charactersTheSixthRing, Sep 24, 2016

Paler than their other offerings but pretty average overall. Aroma is that of starfruit and citrus. Decent but pretty simple. Beer opens honeydew and citrus with some sugary sweetness and syrup in the middle. There's a hint of pine and grass in the back but the hop bitterness is pretty subdued and drowned out by the big tropical fruit malt character throughout. Refreshing, crisp and clean on the palate and bone dry going down and in the finish. 
This one doesn't stand out to me... that doesn't mean its not good though. A pretty solid interpretation of a NE IPA. 620 charactersSpeedwayJim, Sep 23, 2016

4.27/5  rDev -3.2%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a chilled can into a tulip glass. Not sure how old the beer was, I received it as a gift a week earlier and I don't know how long ago Trillium had it available.
L: Massachusetts/New England IPA... orangish (though a dark orange, not as bright as some of those from Tree House), cloudy with some translucence, it seemed like I could see 1/8 inch or so into the murky depths. Poured thicker than most IPAs, but this seems to be the NE IPA trend
S: citrusy, fruity, summer fruits... combination of orange, mango, nectarine sort of. There was a sweetness like cream with an underlying spicy note we couldn't place.
T: The sweet, fruit forward hop aromas were prevalent in the immediate flavors, but they were quickly balanced by a slight spicy and herbal qualities from other hops. The malt bill also contributed to an earthy and mineral-like quality. We found it balanced, and complex. 
F: it was thick, but not like nectar. It coats the mouth and lingers. Carbonation was spot on.
O: This beer was made in honor of an oyster bar's 1 yr anniversary. I can see how the fruity, mineral quality in the beer would pair nicely with oysters. The beer was fine by itself, but would really shine in that context. 1,214 charactersGeeL, Sep 04, 2016

4.66/5  rDev +5.7%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75L - more of that delightful OJ haze. A bit darker this time around. Bit of murk, bit of turb. Surprised by how coarse the head bubbles were. This screams overcarbonated, but let's see...
S - less of the piney dank you normally get with Trillium, and more fresh New England citrus. Orange rind, lightly sweet melon, and some pineapple/mango juice. 
T - right out of the blocks, this beer screams BALANCE. Nothing punched my gut in, but I was taken aback by how well all the flavors swirled together. Orange peel and pithy grapefruit up front that lazily transitions into cantaloupe and honey dew. There might be some candied peaches in there too. Then back to mealy piney bitterness for the finish. The beer feels very clean and controlled. Crisp, but enough leeway to let the juice work its way throughout my palate. 
F - I was wrong about the carbonation! Quite the opposite actually. Low low carbonation for an incredibly smooth and stealthy mouthfeel. Sneaks across my tongue and drizzles onto my teeth and pools between my gums and cheeks. Light enough to keep my hand on the glass, ready to take another sip. 
O - one of the more impressive Trillium beers. This ain't the out of control flavor bomb Headroom is or the drinkable, well-done Fort Point, but rather a happy medium. Again, emphasis on the balance. Puts the "craft" in craft beer. 1,350 charactersagreenman19, Sep 01, 2016

If you're from my area I highly recommend the trip - it was so worth it.  This was another stunning brew from Trillium.  Not much of an aroma but that's not as important to me as taste and feel which this brew has.  Wonderfully smooth and drinkable.  Its almost dangerous how easy this drinks with this high a ABV level.  Not the best I've had but a stellar brew.  Will def do another MASS beer run in the future. 507 charactersnjcraftguy, Aug 31, 2016

Smell is corn, wheat, lemon, orange, white grape, sea salt, and a sweet sour zip of yellow mustard.
Taste is almost like a gose, with salty lemon and wheat. Overall this is a little tart. Wow this weird for an IPA that is labeled neither as a gose or a wheat.
This beer does not feel like 8.0%. It actually feels very light and drinkable, especially due to the gose like properties. The odd, off-style attributes of this beer make it a little unnerving at first, but it's actually quite tasty. 553 charactersSabtos, Aug 11, 2016

canned on 07/12/2016.
poured into HF wine stem.
Appearance: opaque and turbid yellow body beer with large head. Head has staying power and slowly drops down to thin cap with lots of lacing left on the glass.
Smell: light citrus and pine. Spicy, earthy, and dank hops. 
Taste: Mild to moderate bitterness that is balanced nicely with pilsner malts and wheat. Juicy oranges and tropical fruits. Melon rind and grass notes. Lingering finish of spicy garlic and onion. 
Mouthfeel: medium bodied beer that has adequate carbonation. Soft and creamy body. Very drinkable for a DIPA; no booze to be found.
Overall: Very solid hoppy beer. I could do without the garlic and onion flavors in this beer that the only minor thing about this beer. Otherwise this beer is up to the usually Trillium standards. 821 characters4DAloveofSTOUT, Aug 08, 2016

S - big peach, papaya, passion fruit, pine, grapefruit, smells like a great ne ipa
T - big peach, papaya, dank hops, pine resin, ganja, light garlic onion, grapefruit, overly ripe fruits, adds more resin tones in the taste
M - light to medium pillowy mouthfeel, bitter, aftertaste is mostly grapefruit pith, then pine, tropical fruits in the background, alcohol is covered. I'm starting to see how early dry hopping creates that interaction between hops and yeast that makes these beers so soft to drink. 
O - I have to go with a 5 on this one. It's basically perfect. Great beer. I really couldn't ask for anything more. Honestly, I should just give the appearance a 5 too but I'll leave it at my first instinct. 921 charactersHopHunter19, Aug 03, 2016

Consumed 8/1/16
A: Tangerine gold - pours hazy and opaque, perhaps not as milky as some other Trillium beers (not a complaint) - small, white head, fades to a few wisps, leaves some streaks of lacing
S: Dank citrus explosion - fresh-squeezed orange juice with some citrus peel, citrus rind, grapefruit juice - floral citrus - super dank and herbal, green - straight-up hop cones - some general spiciness and earth from the abundance of galaxy hops - ripe and under-ripe peach, other light fruits, tropical notes, pineapple and mango - some pale malts and wheat underneath
T: In a word, aggressive - orange and grapefruit juice, flesh, oil, and pith - flowery citrus - peach and apricot - tropical notes with some mango and bitter pineapple - touch of lime that becomes more obvious as it warms - very dank, herbal, and leafy - spicy hop cones - very bitter, but not in an annoying, lingering way - earthy - pale malts, light bread, touch of wheat, finishes with more earth
M: On the heavy side of medium, smooth, slick and oily, dry earthy finish
O: You can really taste those oysters... oh wait
A DIPA from Trillium emphasizing galaxy and citra. How can you go wrong? Either my palate is broken due to the abundance of IPAs I've had lately, or something seems a little off. It's just a touch too aggressive, specifically in its bitterness and earthiness. There are some phenomenal flavors here, and I'm really just splitting hairs, but I prefer some of Trillium's other hoppy monsters (e.g., Heavy Mettle). 1,553 charactersangrybabboon, Aug 02, 2016

A - Cloudy golden orange with a 1.5-finger white head and mild lace.  
S - Bold aromas of pineapple, mango and papaya.  Honey, floral and light malt.  Smells great.
T - The tropical fruits from the aroma plus orange juice, mint, pine, alcohol sweetness and light burn,  and a fresh-hop flavor like they just came off the bines. Finishes with some fruit that yields to a medium-long-lasting good-flavored bitterness.   
M - Medium body and light carbonation.  Resinous, medium-prickly, substantial but finishes fairly dry.
O - A very fine New England Imperial IPA.  I really enjoyed the aroma, flavors and the balance quite a lot.  It seems Trillium knows what they are doing! 756 charactersTucquan, Aug 01, 2016

Aromas of dried grass, berries, lemon zest, grapefruit, melon, and subtle pine resin. Very balanced aromas. Flavors are tropical fruit sweet and tangy forward, with notes of papaya, mango, melon, guava, and passion fruit, with a balance of dried grass, piney notes, and a cracker and toasted backbone. The body is full and crisp at the same time, with a dryness in the backbone. Aftertaste of tart and sweet tropical fruit notes, with a more subtle herbal and grassy hops character. The finish is smooth, dry, and with a fruity linger. Great beer. 667 charactersGarthDanielson, Jul 30, 2016
4.33/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Very hazy bright orange body with a fluffy, off-white head. Aroma is big on citrus; clementines and tangerines, hints of sweet melon and fresh grass. Flavor is bitter with a lot of citrus zest flavor, hints of sweet hard candy. Feel is slick, medium-high carbonation, full bodied. Overall another nice hoppy beer from trillium, but I like the pale ales and IPAs a little better. 378 charactersstephenjmoore, Jul 30, 2016

Hazy beautiful pour, medium-large head that quickly dissipates on a moderately aggressive pour, smells similar to Trillium's Congress St. IPA, peaches mangos etc., with slight boozy and metallic hints, tastes like a less fruity Congress St. with more of a bitter piney afterbite, feel is crisp but almost watery which is surprising given the clear hop presence. Overall this was everything I expect from Trillium's hoppy beers -juicy and delicious! I completely and respectfully disagree with the "bros" rating. Ironically, the staff published on rating beers specifically advising against rating beer that was sampled at a tap as factors such as noise, setting, etc. might influence the perception. Further, tapping a keg at row 34 or anywhere else does not guarantee freshness or consistency across sampling. Grab a something packaged and be consistent in my humble opinion or don't bother reporting because it is useless. 980 charactersBeantownBrews, Jul 12, 2016

The beer pours a hazy and cloudy peach color, golden hues with some orange tones with a soapy white head, only about a finger tall with moderate retention but nice lace. The aroma is wonderful, peaches, nectarines, apricots, beautiful bright pitted fruit with some mango, tangerine and some soft sweet, doughy malt and a nice mineral water presence. The flavors echo the nose so well, huge amounts of light stone fruits, tons of peach flavor, lychee is as advertised, soft white grape acidity, tangerine with some mango as well before a bit of citrus rind bitterness appears, light pine and some hop spice linger well with doughy malt sweetness and a lingering mineral water flavor. The mouthfeel is great, full bodied, coating, soft and smooth yet lively carbonation dances on the tongue with a quenching finish that is moderately dry.
Verdict: A beautiful DIPA from Trillium and a truly world class offering. Often their IPAs become too focused on one flavor, or are too bitter, or just overhopped, ruling out any balance or complexity, however, this is truly great. Complex, excellent balanced with an assertive malt backbone that offers just enough sweetness to keep the bitterness in check, but I just love how bright and delicate the flavors are. This is a really special beer. 1,368 characterskevanb, Jul 11, 2016

Vicinity is probably the most unique IPA I've had from them. The citrus notes really shine through on this one. And while the dankness is there, it enhances the other flavors, rather than distracting from them. Many of their other IPA's seem to drop off after a few weeks, this one seems to hold up rather well. 493 charactersHenliq, Jul 09, 2016

The smell is juicy, what I've come to expect from a NE IPA, I smelled some grapefruit in there, and maybe some peach. Flavorwise, it's kind of sweet, again, very juicy, as one would expect, and not piney. Honestly, it reminds me of a sweeter, more tropical brass monkey. (I consider this to be a good thing.) Pretty solid DIPA offering from Trillium, but not my favorite of theirs. 432 charactersexitmusic, Jul 04, 2016

Pineapple, orange, peach, citrus, pine, and medicinal dankness on the nose. Also picking up a strong sweetness reminiscent of honey. 
taste definitely follows nicely - opens with a huge blast of candied tangerine and orange, citrus zest, peach, mango and pineapple showing up as well. A subtle bitterness coming through on the finish. Very little cracker malt presence, almost nonexistent but still adds something to the beer. Mouthfeel is nice and creamy, medium bodied which makes this too easy to pound.
Overall not a very balanced IPA but as a galaxy fan im absolutely loving this. Straight up juice bomb!! 769 charactersHyptochrons, Jun 22, 2016

Look: Looks like fresh squeezed orange juice. Just how I like it....without the pulp. Cloudy, almost milky at first glance.
Smell: If you smell it close enough its like fresh zest, delicious citrus fruit and a field of flowers. The flora notes on this beer is what hits it out of the the park for me. Yum.
Taste: Juice Bomb. Oranges, lemon , a hit a mango and pineapple with a light crackery finish that balances the hop flavor.
Feel: Incredibly smooth. Creamy and medium bodied hop delight.
Overall: Another knock out from Trillium. I can only say amazing things about this brewery. Everything I have tried thus far is fire. A seriously fruity double IPA. So juicy and dank, with a smell that is a bit addictive. Trillium, always a hit.

This one pours a pretty hazy yellow/orange, classic Trillium look, hazy and bright-looking, with a half inch head, and a lot of sticky looking lacing.
This one smells wonderfully hoppy and juicy, orange creamsicle, grapefruit, melon, tangerine, with basically no malt character, as expected.
This is classic Trillium, super hoppy and juicy, with very little bitterness. There's tangerine, melon, and grapefruit. It's got a pretty creamy, full taste to it.
This is medium bodied, with a great creamy and juicy mouthfeel, with a nice snap on the finish. This has a normal level of carbonation for the style.
Typical banger from Trillium. 691 charactersGreesyFizeek, May 30, 2016

Pours a mild fizzy fluffy almost 1 finger head that fades at a med pace, decent soapy lacing, super murky hazy milk-shake golden honey orange color.
Nose explodes with juicy hops, even during the pour, great fruity tropical notes, a little pineapple with juicy mild musty citrus, a faint passion fruit and guava perhaps, bright orange juice tangerine, a faint grapefruit, more citrus tropical characters like a hand of Buddha or something like that, maybe lychee, but not really sure what to call it. Also a touch of malt.
Taste brings more Galaxy and tropical fruits, citrus all over as well, big tangerine and orange juice, citrus flesh, a little pith, big tropical notes, generic musty tropical, a little passion fruit and pineapple, juicy almost white peach like fruit as well, it has that character like I just bit into an overripe peach/tangerine/pineapple/clementine homogenized thing and the juice explodes, also a little flesh of papaya (that mild squishy tropical version of watermelon thing). A little toasted creamy malt base, maybe a touch cracker malt, not sweet at all and no real booze. The hops start to turn a bit spicy on the back end, more grapefruit rind, a little melon rind as well, orange peel, spicy chewy hops too, especially on the dry finish, and a touch of booze wafting out late.
mouth is med bod, a little soft creamy feel, decent carb, no booze.
Overall, well let's just say that I'm finally turning my views on Trillium around. Initially I thought their beers were good, but not great. Lately I've been having more of them and I feel they have really stepped up their game and are starting to become a contender with Tree House for best brewery in MA (who are second only to Hill Farmstead in the U.S.) . Trillium makes some great beers now, although they also make meh ones as well, but still maybe a level below Tree House, but working their way up there. So glad to have some incredible breweries like this in MA. 1,970 charactersjlindros, May 28, 2016

3.56/5  rDev -19.3%look: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5I stopped into the Fort Point location to get some Secret Stair, and they didn't have any.  After describing what I generally like (strong ales - Double, triple, quad generally Belgian in style and Stouts) not overly bitter and hoppy.  I have had some Double IPA's that I really like Six Point Resin, and my local Sip of Sunshine by Lawson's - Heady is just a little much for me.  This Double IPA sounded great, but just didn't hit the mark.
The look is wonderful straw colored and murky, can't see my fingers around the glass thick.  Poured with a nice creamy head that lingers - looks great, good start...
The smell - As soon as I popped the cap I could smell the grapefruit and other citrus rising from the bottle, it was enticing me to love this drink...
The taste following the smell, was a good complex flavor of Citrus, fruity,  malty great front end - then the bitter, hoppy after bite - just what I said I didn't want.  I prefer it smooth.  This is not as hoppy as Heady I could finish it and I've been know to pour out a Heady.
The feel was thick creamy and full in the mouth, with a mild carbonation that felt good.  Not as effervescent as I would generally want but satisfying. 
Overall, For me this was an OK beer.  There are many I would turn to first - Like Sip of sunshine - on a hot day.  but if you are looking for a flavorful citrus IPA with a bitter bite you could do worse than this.
I am interested now in the others that they sold me, Metal, Heavy Metal and Pot & Kettle - will they be as bitter? We shall see... 1,541 charactersMiccal, May 21, 2016

4.64/5  rDev +5.2%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Poured into a Duvel tulip.  Label says 04/28/16.
A- Pours a cloudy medium amber color with a 3/4 inch off-white head that retains well before becoming a thick ring around the edge of the glass and a full sheet of sheer surface foam.  Resilient lacing leaves small clots behind.
S- All citrus in the nose to the point that I get a vitamin C type note from it.  Also some dankness and grassiness though.
T- Pure juicy hop flavor with a bit of bitterness at first but it soon subsides and you're left with an orange creamsicle kind of aftertaste.  So incredibly drinkable for the ABV.  Rides that narrow line between juice drink and resiny hop bomb.  
M- Slightly sharp from the hops but also creamy.  Medium carbonation and a lightish body.
O- They've really got the juicy hop flavor:bitterness:alcohol ratio down pat on this one.  Damn near perfect in every way.  Probably my favorite Trillium to date actually. 915 charactersImmortale25, May 18, 2016

4.14/5  rDev -6.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Bottled 4/29/2016. More IPAs!!!
Appearance - The appearance is hazy, but a much lighter hue of orange and yellow than previous renditions of Trillium IPAs. This is more of a pale, straw color than a deep orange. The middle of the glass where it is thickest glows darker than the rest, giving a nice sun-like appearance.
Aroma - The nose is subdued at times but is very much focused on the hops. This isn't an aggressive aroma, but what is there is pleasant. The Galaxy and Citra play nicely together, batting volleys of peach, lychee, and lemon back and off. There is a slight catty or skunky note at the very end.
Taste - The taste follows the aroma almost to a T. It's quite hoppy but without that raw harshness that a couple Trillium's exhibited. It's a little more balanced here than the aroma was, where a combination of fruits, pine resin, and even some slightly spicy flavors make there way here.
Mouthfeel - The mouthfeel is medium-bodied with somewhat low carbonation. Soft texture. Pretty much par for the course.
Closing Arguments - Overall, Vicinity is a nice beer but lurks within the weeds among Trillium's other offerings. I feel like other beers do what this one does in a better manner. Still a very tasty beer, though. 1,241 charactersnhindian, May 16, 2016

A - Beautiful new-East Coast body: hazy banana wheat.  Creamy white head pours a finger high in the hotel's lowball glass.  Nice retention and lace.  Extra points for looking good in a ridiculous glass.  Note to self, next time go downstairs and get proper glassware from the bar.
S - Trillium is to noses on IPA's what Mikkeller is to appearance on stouts - world class and remarkably consistent.  Cracking the cap filled the entire room with sweet tropical hops.  Rich cilantro, sage, and pine pop out once it hits the glass, with fruit notes of grapefruit pith, tangerine, pineapple, and orange rinds.
T - Smooth and fruity with a round, woody undertone.  Orange, tangerine and grapefruit up front with a silky smooth oat and malt center.  Pine, cilantro and soft, fresh wood slide seemlesly into the picture to round out the finish.
M - I'm honestly ambivalent on the mouthfeel.  Silky smooth and incredibly drinkable, but relatively light bodied for the style.  It's growing on me the more I drink it though.  
O - Stellar.  A fantastic example of a new-East Coast DIPA. 1,160 charactersvfgccp, May 05, 2016

A: Opaque, light gold with an off-white half finger head that dissipated to light foam.
S:  Lots of tropical fruits, mangoes, lemons, oranges and pineapple.

Pours an opaque dark gold color with a creamy white foam head. Smells like big guava and passionfruit, some mango, pineapple, orange, mild peach, slight onion, with fresh pine and dank earthy grass. Tastes very dank and earthy with fresh fruit notes backing it. Grape must and lychee flesh start it off with some sweet onion, followed by a tropical undertone of guava, mango and peach, some malty grain, ending in a dry pine, dank earthy grass finish. Feels medium-full, thick and creamy with low carbonation. Overall a really great DIPA. 567 charactersStoutElk_92, Mar 18, 2016

I get a ton of oranges in the aroma. There is intense citrus and some resinous bitterness, but it isn't at all harsh. A bit of minerality. I feel like I remember this having more sweetness in the past. Some more tropical fruit. White grapes. The body is nice. The galaxy hops are certainly countered well to prevent harshness.

A super-hazy orange color, with a two finger soft and tight white head that leaves huge lace.
Aroma is superb - all tropical - with mango, guava, pineapple, papaya-like aromas.
Taste is the same as the aroma - straight-up delicious.  Very tropical with a juicy sweetness and only a hint of bitterness on the finish.

3.95/5  rDev -10.4%look: 3.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4Poured into a snifter.  Big thanks to NizzleEGizzle for hooking me up.
3.25 A:  Murky, but "bright" orange brown color.  Less than a finger of creamy off-white head formed.  Retention is well below average given the style.  A few scattered wisps of lacing are left behind.
4.5 S:  Pretty awesome nose on this.  Huge lemongrass right from the start.  Grapefruit and pith, orange, touch of lemon.  Secondarily floral with coriander and white pepper-esque spiciness.  Clean overall, but there's a hint of bready yeastiness.  
3.75 T:  While the nose is vibrant, the taste is more subdued.  To start, for a DIPA, there's only a very mild bitterness.  The hops are almost equally floral and citrusy, while the nose was more citrus forward.  Still lots of lemongrass with grapefruit and orange following.  Finishes with the same mild spiciness.
3.75 M:  Medium body.  Good moderate carbonation.  There's some creaminess but I could use some more.
4.0 D:  Solid beer, but doesn't quite live up to expectations. 1,008 charactersDavoleBomb, Jan 11, 2016

5/5  rDev +13.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Look - Had to make sure I actually poured the beer and not my children's orange/grapefruit juice. Murky, completely hazed....looks exactly like juice in the tulip. And a big pillowy white head that I'd lay on if I could. Amazing looking stuff! 
Smell -  As soon as I cracked the bomber the aroma smacks me in the face (in a good way). So freaking tropical. Pineapple, mango, guava, some citrus, some grapefruit, underlining dankness. Possibility the best smelling beer I've stuck my nose in yet. 
Taste - Follows the nose. A tropical juice bomb!! Pineapple, mango, lychee, citrus, grapefruit, some pithy type bitterness that suited my palate perfectly. 
Feel - Glorious mouthfeel. No clue where the 8.0% is. So easy drinking for a DIPA. 
Overall - This beer is perfect. Plain and simple. Hangs in there (if not better than) all of Treehouse's DIPAs. It's that good. The only downfall is I cant drink this everyday....;( 920 charactersTonyjenlasc, Oct 27, 2015

22oz bottle into a tulip
Thanks to eb1610 for sending this over as an extra, super generous beer trader!
A: Pours a hazy to the point of being opaque, pale dirty straw in color, 1plus fingers width of bright white head which has decent retention before dissipating down and leaves a small amount of lacing.  Its very murky, and is actually quite an ugly looking beer.  3
S: Very fruited, citrusy, floral, some piney bitterness, a bit of booze.  4.25
T: Very floral, lots of piney bitterness, decent amount of citrus, balancing malt sweetness.  4
M/D: Fuller side of medium body, pretty smooth for the style, ABV is present but not negatively so, drinkability is good.  4.25
O: Really good beer.  My second Trillium offering, I preferred the first one better (Congress Street), but still very enjoyable.  4.25 838 characterszac16125, Oct 16, 2015

It was like the first time I had heady topper but without any of the expectations and hype going into it. I knew nothing of this beer. Ton of floral fruity fresh hop resin aroma. Flavor was a nice grassy citrus  papaya guava. Bitterness was very low for me. Almost as if all hops were flame out/dry hop additions. 346 charactersJT99125, Oct 12, 2015

4.52/5  rDev +2.5%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 750 mL bottle into a Trillium tulip glass. Thanks Steve for hooking me up with this!
Pours a super hazy orange-yellow opaque body reminiscent of pineapple juice with a 2 finger white head that reduces slowly to leave heavy lacing and moderate retention. I can tell this is going to be one hoppy beer.
Huge citrus and tropical aromas.. grapefruit, pineapple, bursting passionfruit, oranges, some dankness and resin, maybe a very light hint of alcohol in the background. 
The taste follows the nose, lots of citrus, creamy malt backbone to compliment the big tropical hoppy notes.. the finish is slightly bitter and maybe a bit piney. Medium body,  medium-light carbonation. 
Another great one from Trillium. Can't go wrong with this brewery! 758 charactersgcamparone, Sep 26, 2015

Taste is citrusy, with grapefruit the most distinct flavor, and a grassy, earthy taste that fades into a soft bitterness. Really light in the mouth, with a pleasant medium carbination. Overall this is a very well put together beer. Very drinkable, with a great nose and a nice complex flavor. Another strong offering from Trillium.

Pours a hazy, golden yellow in color with 2 fingers of pillowy off white head that leaves moderate lacing and leaves just a thin cap. Aroma is predominantly hoppy with lots of grapefruit, tangerine, mango and lemon. There are also some "dank" notes that are present throughout but linger in the background. Taste is much like the aroma with a strong hoppy profile. Good mouthfeel with medium body and medium+carbonation. There is a bit of alcohol here but nothing overly hot. OWhile hops were the dominant aroma and flavor they were somewhat muted for a DIPA. I'm a fan of Trillium, especially their IPAs but I was a bit underwhelmed here. This is a solid DIPA and while I won't go as far as saying that I was disappointed I will say that I expected more. 805 charactersmnj21655, Sep 01, 2015

This was an all around fantastic beer. One of the best smell/taste combinations I've experience. Will absolutely be looking for more from Trillium in the future. 323 charactersAllDayIPA23, Aug 16, 2015

Nice sweet tropical fruit hops in the aroma. Little malt character. Very nice. The taste is light and full of hop fruit flavor. Mango, pineapple, a little papaya, mild tangerine. Good stuff. No real malt sweetness but it is fairly sweet. It makes me think of hoppy beers that stay away from early hop additions. Moderate bitterness in the finish. Solid DIPA. 438 characterspopery, Aug 03, 2015

smell is a bit more muted than I was expecting.   Hoppy but not overly so.
Taste is like an orange or sweet grapefruit juice with a bit of beer mixed in
Mouthfeel is average.  Nothing to write home about unless you haven't written home in a while and need an excuse to do so.
overall an awesome beer but I will admit that it does not line up with the price point. 419 characters2ellas, Jul 29, 2015

The taste has waves of hops and bittnerness and the feel is great as expected.  However, this drank "big" and came out more like a 10% ipa would.  Wasn't expecting that and made it less easy to drink. 276 charactersBeer4B, Jul 27, 2015

Looks like orange juice poured into a snifter. Big, foamy head with brilliant lace. Aroma is big citrusy orange, grapefruit, lemon, grassy, flowery and earthy scents. Taste hits you with citrusy, but a bit more subdued balancing nicely with a pilsner malt dominance. Slight bitterness on the backend. Feel is medium with a bitter citrus follow. Carbonation is just right. Overall, a really, really good DIPA. 438 charactersJamesStreet, Jul 23, 2015

Overall, this is one of the best beers Trillium puts out. 372 charactersMattyEsq, Jul 23, 2015

4.04/5  rDev -8.4%look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4Pours a completely hazy, lovely sun-yellow color, with a big, extremely stable head. 
Smells outstandingly dank, of a flooded backyard with flowers and lemon zest hints randomly added, almost a bit skunky, reminding me of leaf infused herbs. Out of that foundation onion and crispy orange rind are rising up, creating a pleasant, very focussed hop complexity. 
Has a higher carbonation, while the beer provides an enjoyable medium body, which remains refreshing, while featuring a fantastic hop bitterness.
Begins with grassy hops and a decent amount of toast, with lemon blending into that melange. Malts get a tad sweeter, as the lemon turn sun-bathed ripe and juicy, guided by the beers outstanding dankness. Finishes with a pleasant minerality, while the hops turn lemony dry, exhibiting wet grass and even more lime.
Its real hop punch unveils late, while it creates an immense intensity and doesn't leave the palate for a long while. Before that, the brew exhibits a fantastic, soft aqueous mouthfeel, adding to its dank character. The hops arent too diverse in this, while they unfold a fantastic, pungent lime defined punch. The beers high abv isn't noteable at all, as it drinks almost too easy, not providing a particularly huge body, but very convincing and focused in taste. 1,290 charactersaleigator, Jul 18, 2015

The aroma offers mango, passionfruit, juicy orange, tangerine, green herbaceous, plastic dank from Galaxy, a raw doughy quality. 
The flavor follows with a bright smack of tangerine, orange zest, a medium minus white bready sweetness, then onto green grass, unripen mango, grapefruit pith, resin, a plastic dank again with a medium bitterness.
The mouthfeel is creamy,  with some chewy breadiness, but a clean and bitter finish.
One of the best hoppy offerings from Trillium, or any brewery. 596 charactersdar482, Jul 15, 2015

The head is 2 fingers, bright white, dense and made up of very very tiny bubbles. Retention is very good and there are many sheets of hanging lacing. Smell is mango, orange, pineapple, peach, dankness and a slight earthiness. Taste is the same sans pineapple. Just a slight bitterness on the finish. Feel is amazing. Medium and a bit sticky but so soft and juicy. Overall an awesome beer. Just amazing! 480 charactersCNoj012, May 30, 2015

A - Comes out looking like fresh-squeezed juice, somewhere between orange and grapefruit. Looks particularly ravishing when the light hits it. Hazy. Finger of head. Beautiful lacing.
N - A big blast of citrus, heavy on the grapefruit. Some light tropical tones within.
T - An earthy, citrus ball of wonders.
M - Soft, smooth. I've heard the word "pillowy" describing this beer's mouthfeel. I'll have to agree. It's so pleasant going down, you can damn near take big gulps and not notice you're messing with 8%.
O - I've gotten this on two trips to Trillium. It's my favorite offering from them thus far. SONIC BOOM IS IN THE ROOM! 726 charactersMakeMineADoubleJack, May 30, 2015

another review milestone.  22 oz bottle was poured into a tulip glass. 
Appearance:  A two finger head was poured that reduced to a puffy layer.  It is a hazy pale yellow color with some vision of anything.  Frothy lacing down the glass as the beer was drank. 
Smell:  Lemony, herbal, spicy, floral, citrus, tropical, pine, and grasy hops followed by toasted, bready, biscuity, pale, and caramel malts. 
Taste:  Love the lemon flavor, tropical notes, floral, grassy, herbal, piney, citrus, and tropical hops followed by toasted, bready, biscuity, cracker, and caramel malts.  Some chewiness and slight bitterness in the rear. 
Mouthfeel:  Smooth, medium to full bodied, a little chewy, slight bitterness, medium carbonation, and juicy.
Overall:  I really hope they make more of this.   Of course they are.  Going back this week to get more. 892 charactersFlounder57, May 23, 2015

Outstanding nose, and delicious creamy DIPA.  Split a 4/28 bottle on Saturday night 5/16 and probably didn't let it warm up enough to get all the flavors are out.  Excellent excellent brew.  Crazy that a beer like this remains on the shelves at the brewery for weeks while camp outs and immediate sell outs occur for similar competitors in Maine and Vermont.   I'll keep an eye out for its next release. 430 charactersmrz200, May 18, 2015

And this one is beyond unfiltered. Cloudy, thick, hazy, opaque...every word to describe such a beauty. Great head and lace/retention as to be expected. Huge, pungent citrus and tropical fruit. But this is unique in that it bites your nose and senses. Only a few IPAs I've experienced can do that. I also get some raw, unfiltered, honey. Not sure if this makes sense. Same with the taste/flavor...so much citrus, fruit, juicy wet hops, pine. The epitome of hops and the style. Body, feel, and drinkability are obviously off the charts. Wow. Just wow. Unbelievable beer. Thank you, again, judkinst!!!
Extra points for citrusy burps, too. 733 charactersGatch, May 16, 2015

3.79/5  rDev -14.1%look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.7522oz. bottle served in a tulip at 44 degrees.  Bottled 042515.  Pours a dull orange with a tight, one inch, bright white head that eventually settles into a solid quarter inch cap.  Clarity is quite turbid and lacing is delicate and textured.  Nose expresses tangerines, citrus rind, and a grassy/spicy quality towards the back.   Taste is a bit odd - consistent with nose in many ways; however, there's a strange medicinal quality in the middle and a light earthy hops presence at the finish.  Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a crisp carbonation and a kiss of acidity.  Overall, decent DIPA but not my favorite Trillium offering.  Nose and flavor profile comes off a bit muddled. 687 charactersJwale73, May 15, 2015

A: Pours an opaque, orange-tinted pale color with two fingers of bright, snow-white head.  Superb retention and large swaths of attractive lacing.
S: Fresh citrus (tangerine, pink grapfruit), hay, apple. 
T: More of a non-descript citrus, slight malty sweetness.  A light bitterness providing structure and drying out the finish.  Clean finish.  
M: Medium body and medium-light carbonation.  Soft, slightly creamy texture.
O: Delicious.  Clean flavor with lots of fresh citrus.  Tied with Melcher St. for my favorite Trillium IPA. 568 characterspmarlowe, May 01, 2015

Superb frothy, chewy pale white head that shows excellent persistence. Lacing is everywhere. So scattered. Body is a cloudy orange and yellow mixture. Again, this looks like a pulpy juice. 4.25
A bit pissy on the nose with some passionfruit, pineapple and a slightly vegetal and floral aroma. 4
Fruit makes its way to the palate, passionfruit and mango, and a better dose of sweetness and malt than I've found in other similar beers. Melon and mango linger on my tongue with each sip. 4.25
The body feels a bit light for a DIPA, but the refreshing factor, juiciness, and medium carbonation all play well. The bitterness starts potently but mellows out quickly and lingers in a quiet sort of way with each sip. 4.25
Great aroma and flavor. I appreciate the consistency from nose to palate. It drinks very well too, almost dangerously so. Killing a 750 wouldn't be much of a problem. 943 charactersONovoMexicano, Apr 24, 2015

4.34/5  rDev -1.6%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Thanks Kevin for sharing a bottle of this last night. Notes taken at the time.
A- Poured into a wine glass with a murky, turbid appearance; almost milky look to the golden body. The cap raises to over a finger with good retention dropping webs of lacing as it dies and I sip.
S- A massive blast of fresh hops; reaches into the higher tiers of pungency for sure. Juicy brightness with notes of ripe mango, tangerine, oranges, pineapple, dankness and citrus zest. A bit of yeast ester and bread but the hops are strong with this one.
T- Pretty much summed up in the nose with more pale grains and a hint of sweetness. Oranges, passionfruit, mangoes, apricot, tangerines, floral and zesty citrus notes. Hop nectar.
MF- Right around medium bodied with a consistency that is creamy and foamy but not chewy; really smooth. A touch of warmth and moderately bitter finish.
Very thankful to my brother-in-law for sharing some Boston-only brews lately with me. Trillium has been up there on my list for quite some time and all of their brews have delivered. 1,052 characterscbutova, Apr 20, 2015

Nose has a rich tropical fruit presence, pineapple, peach, light orange citrus, a bit of caramel malt and notes of resin. Body is full and heavy, assertive carb, gets a touch sticky. Some sweet malt backbone, a little sugary, hops are super aggressive, Peach, citrus, faint resin. Finish is fairly bitter and takes away from the clean hop flavors slightly. 478 characterscpetrone84, Apr 16, 2015

I am somewhere between the Bros. and the world on this... no doubt... this is a solid double and totally worth getting a hold of... but after having the Upper Case... tough to rate above that one. Something in the finish... a little tart... that took away from the smooth aftertaste of some of the other doubles in this class. 404 charactersfulcrumbs, Apr 11, 2015

s - nose is all you could ask for in a IIPA, lush ripe citric fruit...really tropical, mango like even.  Just oozes juiciness.
t/m/o - surprisingly thin, some heat is noticeable, but all in all a super solid IIPA that leads with the tropical fruit advertised in the nose. Dangerously drinkable and one of the better new IIPA I have had in a long while.  Go get this one. It is VERY good. 628 characterscosmicevan, Feb 15, 2015

A: Pours a very cloudy light orange. Tall, frothy offwhite head. Head retention is top notch and there are heavy walls of lacing as it slowly recedes.  
S: The nose on this is fantastic. Pungent, sharp grapefruit and orange peel. Hints of tropical fruit like pineapple primarily. A hint of some dank, resinous underbelly.  Wonderful.
T: More of the same. Loads of wonderful sweet and bitter citrus. Orange and grapefruit and pineapple all stand out once again. Sharp, biting flavors. A really bitter piney resin is in there too, mainly towards the finish. No real sign of malt, maybe some breadiness under all the hops but it's barely noticeable. Get hints of garlic/onion in the aftertaste, I'm guessing there's plenty of citra in here. 
M: Medium bodied, fairly smooth with a big hop bitterness punch. Lightly dry in the aftertaste.
O: Pretty serious DIPA. Fantastic if you like the fruitier hop varieties. Lots of hop complexity, lots of pungent flavors and aromas but the bitterness is contained well enough. Not teeth-chatteringly bitter but still plenty strong. Nice. 1,116 charactersDope, Feb 14, 2015

Hazy yellow with a dense white one finger lid, great lacings. 
Really nice tropical and citrus aroma
Hops on the front of the tongue. Tropical notes all over the tongue. 
Gentle bitterness lingers all over the tongue. No sudsing.almost creamy. slight bitter aftertaste 
I like it, I like it a lot and will definitely go back for more. My new favorite from Trillium. 399 charactersWunderLlama, Feb 13, 2015

3.58/5  rDev -18.8%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5750 ML bottle dated 1/20/2015 poured into a larger version of the Sam Adams perfect pint glass.  Beer comes out an extremely hazy cloudy dark yellow color.  Glows when you hold it up to the light, but you still can't see through it.  Little bit of a head mostly small bubbles but a few a little bigger that stick around and provide a little bit of lacing, but not a ton.  To sum it up it kind of looks like pineapple juice with a head on it. Not really how I prefer my double IPAs to look because it's so hazy, but I guess some like it that way.
Smell is actually really good, not quite like any Double IPA I've ever smelled before.  It's the hops at first, but there's huge amounts of tropical fruits, primarily pineapple and mango.  Very bready/yeasty as well in the middle then there's some herbal tea like aromas.  I don't really like how strong the yeasty aromas are, but the hops smell so good it's worth it.
Taste is a really huge step down, there are good parts to it, but really a lot of it is odd.  Starts sort off sort of sweet, gets bready/yeasty in the least flavorful way possible.  There are some tropical fruit flavors but different than the aromas.  The tropical aromas smelled natural and fresh, it tastes like canned/syrupy mango and pineapple, maybe papaya too.  There's also a sort  of weird club soda bitter flavor towards the end.  There's an aftertaste though that's pretty good, it tastes like the natural tropical fruits again, don't know how that makes sense, but that's how it tastes to me.
Mouthfeel is pretty ok, almost good.  Has a really strong layering/lingering flavor with just a sloppy, messy mix of flavors going on.  A good carbonation level with a gritty dry bitter finish.  It's such an interesting array of flavors it really adds to the drinkability, I keep wanting to drink it.  Overall I think it's a pretty over hyped beer, I think Trillium tired to do something a little different and it just didn't quite mesh well.  I don't quite get all of the high reviews, maybe I got a bad bottle.  If you were to ask me this is worth trying but not worth seeking out.  Right now Mayflower has a Double IPA out that is leaps and bounds better than this; I'd say if you wanted to stay local and want a good Double IPA, go for that. 2,267 charactersAndyAvalanche, Feb 13, 2015

A- Cloudy yellow-copper body, two finger fluffy white head that retains well, leaves an average amount of lacing on the glass. 
S- Resinous pine, grapefruit, citrus zest. Toasted bread. Minerals. 
F- Grapefruit, tangerines, orange peel, toasted bread, a bit of honey, minerals (presumably that house yeast) and a very bitter mix of pine and citrus on the backend. The bitterness seems to build up the more you drink this beer.
M- Medium bodied, a bit fluffy and feels soft yet substantial. Typical of Trillium's pale ales. Surprisingly bitter and resinous pine finish.
O- Very good and bitter DIPA, but not one of my favorites from this otherwise excellent brewery. 732 charactersStevedore, Feb 09, 2015

Pours a delicious looking cloudy, golden orange color with a thick dome of white head that clings to the glass like a newborn. The nose is a bouquet of pine, citrus, and has undertones of spicy cedar and grass clippings - it's aromatic, but subdued. The taste is similarly juicy with hops that cast a surge of tropical IBUs on the palate, yet it isn't nearly as punishing as expected in the finish. There's a great yeast presence, minimal alcohol, and an equalizing grain sweetness. For being a big beer, this drinks easily with fine carbonation, a slightly creamy yeast/protein presence, and moderately bitter, semi-sweet finish. I'm thinking the hype is strong with this one, but it satisfied a serious DIPA itch. 755 charactersThePorterSorter, Feb 07, 2015

Appearance: Hazy, cloudy orange-yellow with a THICK, pillowy head. Spirals of carbonation throughout.
Smell: This beer absolutely floored me with regard to smell. Blasted with citrus rind, tangerine, and mango. Very tropical, with some maltiness hidden behind the juice blast that you first smell.
Taste: An absolute juice-bomb......starts piney and finishes with some of the most powerful tropical flavors I've ever experienced from an IIPA. The taste lived up to the smell and more. I expected fruit and citrusy flavors from the look and smell, but the taste was mind-blowing.
Feel: not as thick and sticky as some of the other Trillium brews, but the feel fits the beer. Smooth and medium-thick.
Overall: The best IIPA I've had from Trillium, and one of the better brews I've had in a long, long time. Delicious. 868 charactersTheElectricOne, Feb 02, 2015

4.09/5  rDev -7.3%look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Poured from bottle dated 1/20/15.
Pours a hazy orange/amber with a beautiful fluffy white head.  Initial aroma is of hops/resinous pine, and biscuity malt. You get some citrus, but more citrus rind than fruit. 
Taste is right on point with the smell with that resin and citrus rind really pushing to the front. 
Mouthfeel is above average, but nothing that makes you stop and really consider it. 
Overall this is another solid IIPA from an amazing brewery. I score this lower that the other offerings I've had because I prefer less bitter/smoother brews that really focus on citrusy hops. 592 charactershuddyball, Feb 01, 2015

Anywho...
I'm not sure what the BA "Bro" saw or tasted, but here's the deal -- YESTERDAY Jason's review was 2.68.  TODAY, it's 3.03, with the same review.  Not sure what he tried at first, a few weeks ago -- not judging him on that.  But I tried is yesterday and it was not even close to his review, which has not changed.  So he either tried is unfinished earlier, or is trying to make up for it now by changing his rating.  I have zero respect for the "Bros" now.
This is simply one of the most flavorful IPAs I have ever tasted.  First, the appearance.  It's a hazy orange-yellow, like most IPAs.  The head is huge and lasting.  Smell: 'POW' right in the kisser.  Tangerine, grapefruit; it's incredible.  Next is the Taste.  And it stands up to the smell.  Damn, that is powerful.  Super sweet citrus just getting jammed down your throat.  You want to chug it but the smell stops you.  Gotta savor it.
Get two so you don't ruin your palate beforehand.  Seriously incredible.  This made me a fan of Trillium. 1,273 charactersakrz47, Feb 01, 2015

Appearance: Pours a hazy blonde, light amber and leaves a finger of white head, that slowly fades to a layer atop the beer. (4.5)
Smell: Lots of earthy tones, spruce, mangoes, pineapple. Quite expressive and mouth-watering. Definitely hop forward. (4.5)
Taste: Very tropical fruity taste - guava, pineapple, mango. Pretty juicy. Some grassy and earthy flavors as well as spruce.Very interesting and refreshing. Different from most of the IPA's out there for sure. (4.75)
Mouth-feel: Medium carbonation with a medium, creamy body. Works very well with the flavor profile (4.75)

Bottled 012015
Served in a snifter
The super hazy, bordering on murky, yellow ochre liquid was topped by a surprisingly small, bubbly and frothy crown. Fairly poor retention. The head quickly faded to a soapy looking ring of bubbles. Thin, drippy, streaky lacing trickled along the sides of the glass.
Outstanding aroma. It was intensely hoppy and uber tropical. Passionfruit dominated. Loads of guava. Juicy tangerine notes also came through strong. Perhaps some orange juice as well. Super dank with fresh, marijuana-like notes. Touch of candied citrus peel. Somewhat spicy and zippy. Coriander was detectible.
Flavorwise, the beer was also super juicy and fruity. Tangerine juice came to mind. Loads of guava and mango. Orange peel was apparent. Slightly peachy. Nice balance of sweet and bitter hop notes. Tart in the center. Super lemony and bright. Somewhat spicy and almost a bit peppery. Dank, weed-like notes were noticeable as well. The beer finished slightly pithy and bitter with notes of ruby red grapefruit. Amazingly quaffable and immensely enjoyable.
The mouthfeel was thinner bodied than anticipated but still solid. Creamy and frothy on the palate. The liquid contained a fine, mellow effervescence and almost seemed a bit under carbonated.
Trillium never ceases to disappointment me with their hoppy beer releases, and Vicinity is definitely another winner. Although I may not be quite as big a fan of this as I am with most of their variations of Fort Point Pale Ale and Mettle, it is nevertheless an outstanding offering. 1,637 charactersDamian, Jan 24, 2015
4.34/5  rDev -1.6%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25Bottle. Pours a hazy, pale orange color. Glowing. Head is a ripple froth congregation. Not much lace. Fruit juice hop liquid. Very reminiscent to Trillium's Mettle and Heavy Mettle. Pineapple, citrus, some bubblegum, peach and mango hops. Blasphemous amounts of aromatic hops. The flavor is such a concentrated influx of hoppiness that all flavors border on excess. That's a compliment in my book. I expected a brine of pure hop and I got it. All those fruity descriptors can be found here and in plentiful quantities. Rich, dank and superbly fruity. Malt? Provided a surprising balance that leads to a finish that is spookily mellow. Bitterness is low and I actually am jiving with it. The body is also stunningly light. This brew is another hop cauldron from Trillium. They have a very specific flavor and it reminds me a lot of some of their previous offerings. I have also absolutely loved those previous offerings. Did they do it again? Yes, comrade, yes. 960 charactersVelvetExtract, Jan 24, 2015

A - 2.5 fingers of bubbly white head.  Great retention and lacing.  Hazy golden body with orange hues.

Sorry for not being more precise.  Read my original review at your peril, just to show how much improved a great beer can get.  Was being honest at the time, and in my interest in being archival, I'm saving it.  Will delete all and re-review again at next bottle purchase.  Thanks.
Original Review from growler - Not my favorite Trillium, but still excellent.  There's some kind of clawing and lasting bitterness in this one that I'm not loving like I do with most of their other IPAs.  There's less head retention and lacing than other Trillium IPAs but the color, smell, and mouth feel are pretty much par according to Trillium's standards.  I think with this one it just boils down to me not loving the hop combination.  I would hardly call this a let-down, just not one of my favorites from Trillium. 901 charactershopley, Nov 16, 2014

It is incredibly smooth and has such an ease to the mouthfeel. Hops are slightly reminiscent of baseball card gum in the best way imaginable. The abv sneaks in a bit on the finish and just leaves me begging for a rounder ~6?% version. That said it is a dub ipa so I think bigger ipa fans are going to be thrilled with this and rightfully so. If this is Trillium progression we are all pleased. In the vicinity of greatness? 489 charactersdoremite, Nov 14, 2014
