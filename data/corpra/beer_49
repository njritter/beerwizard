Smell is very tropical. Main notes are peach, papaya and grapefruit. 
Taste is a total juice bomb. Peach, pineapple, papaya, grapefruit and a hint of dankness blends superbly with a perfect amount of bitterness.
As all Tree Houses, soft and pillowy mouthfeel.
Terrific juice bomb of a DIPA. Very drinkable, with no hint of the ABV. Another winner by Tree House. 415 charactersJamFuel, Jun 23, 2017

4.69/5  rDev +3.1%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Got this bad boy in a trade, can't wait to try it! Poured into a tulip glass from a 1 Pint can, 8.2% ABV. Bottled date 5/25/17.
Look: Pours a beautiful opaque gold, thin white head of foam, heavy lace.
Smell: Intense piney aromas right away, but with a subtle sweetness that creeps up on you. Distinct notes of tangerine and grapefruit also clearly present. UPDATE: emergence of guava in the smell, not easily noticeable right away, but very apparent in the back of the nose. Amazing.
Taste: Again, very hop forward but equally matched in flavor by an intensely bitter grapefruit balance that is unmistakable.
Feel: Incredibly smooth and drinkable, I would never guess that the ABV clocked in at 8.2%.
This beer is truly unique and incredible. It pours an amazing golden color and the smell is subtle but so potent. At first, with such an amazing look and smell, the mild flavors almost took me back! But after a few more sips and a bit of warmth, it really transformed. Can't get over how smooth this DIPA is, really remarkable. There's a reason Tree House stands tall among American craft breweries. Get it if you can! 1,122 charactersWickedBeer, Jun 18, 2017

The smell is great, feel is excellent, the look is outstanding - as the name describes, this is the absolute perfection of the hazy look. Taste is sweet, but not overbearing in the slightest, and aggressively hopped. World class, my favorite TH beer. 337 characterspeaceloveandhops, Jun 03, 2017

5/5  rDev +9.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5P- Acquired through a trade, on South Shore Beer Exchange. Poured from a 16 oz can,into a Cigar City spiegelau IPA glass.Date on the can is 05/05/17.
L- Thick soapy white colored head,with good retention and sticky lacing.After the head fades away,it leaves thick fluffy patching.Deep hazy straw / yellow colored body,with low clarity and only distorted light showing through the glass.Low amount of carbonation,and heavy amount of sediment.
S- On the nose I get sweet orange juice,fresh peaches,papaya,mango,and pineapple fruit notes.Trace elements of bitter pine hops,and bright biscuit malts.This is a very hop forward beer,mostly consisting of tropical fruits.
T- The palate follows the nose with orange juice,papaya,fresh peaches,mango,and pineapple from the beginning till the end.The palate finishes off with slight flavors of bitter pine that lingers with a sweet biscuit malt balance.This is one of those "juice bomb" IPA's I have been patiently waiting to try.It did not disappoint,at all.
F- The mouth feel is medium heavy,with a very sticky,yet smooth and silky texture.Low amount of oxidation on the tongue.Smooth on the finish,with just a small hint of dryness.
O- I really don't know where to start with this one.This IPA is mind blowing.It is super juicy on the nose and the palate,with a perfect balance of bitter pine.I just wish Tree House wasn't so far away,otherwise I would drink this beer all the time.Trying this makes me very excited, to try some of their other offerings.If you love a good New England IPA / juice bomb,try and get this beer by any means necessary.This beer is pretty much perfect.Actually,this is the best beer I've had since I started doing these reviews.Cheers to Tree House,and Cheers to the gentleman who I traded with to obtain it.I hope you enjoy the Wide Awake,as much as I enjoyed the Haze!!! 1,848 charactersDraconusDesanctus666, May 10, 2017

What separates this beer from other stellar offerings from Alchemist, Trillium, Other Half etc... is the resinous finish.  It finishes  with a strong bitter, resin taste but it quickly dissipates.  Outstanding smooth mouth feel, explosion of hops and fruits in the taste and smell.  Excellent beer, well worth the wait. 410 charactersDrGonzo, May 08, 2017

Look: Pours a golden peachy haze; white head. Tiny bit of lacing.
Aroma: A blend of orange, peach, papaya and pineapple.
Taste: It's complex - definitely need to have a precise palate for this one. Tropical and Stone fruits and some interesting yeast.
Feel: Highly carbonated, soft and heavy.
Overall: I know from tasting this beer how good it is - but I can't figure out exactly why. It's the kind of beer that makes me realize I need to get a beer tasting certification to know what's really going on. 520 charactersAntg8989, May 07, 2017

A: Pours a super hazy, pale orange in color with a one inch, frothy, paper white head with good retention. Thick, white, billowy lacing throughout.
S: Aromas of grapefruit, orange, melons, and guava accompanied by earthy, floral, and piney hops.
T: Starts off with notes of grapefruit and citrus followed by peach, guava, and papaya. Finishes with a light piney, resinous hop bitterness.
F: Medium bodied. Smooth. Minimal carbonation. Somewhat dry.
O: Overall, this is a good DIPA, but I was actually somewhat let down with all the hype. Juicy hop profile and flavor depth was somewhat lacking for me given the reputation. Still a good brew, but I prefer Julius and KJ by a mile. Also, if VH has fairly similar traits I have difficulty seeing how it holds a number one spot. 829 charactersBeerGuy8315, Apr 26, 2017

Beautiful medium gold completely hazed body with a thick finger and a half of head with great retention and lacing. This beer really comes through with the sticky delicious citrus and fruity hop aroma followed by amazing pineapple, peach, and orange juice flavors. Mouthfeel is very balanced, carbonation on point and no alcohol to be detected. Every sip of this brew was a delight and I'm so happy to have had the opportunity to try a beer that emulates my favorite juice of all (orange). 554 charactersDavidR_9, Apr 22, 2017

A slow, deliberate pour summons a white pillowy foam which creeps up the teku but leaves quickly. We are left with a hazy tropical juice. The mouhthfeel is special. So soft. So full of flavor. The hops are miniature gymnasts tumbling on my palette leaving peach Starbursts on the taste buds throughout the entire sip. I taste peach orange juice at the front end and then lemon zest and pineapple on the finish. Delightful. Haze 528 charactersJAStheAce, Apr 04, 2017

Smell: Wow! Beautiful tropical fruit coming off the nose gives way to solid hoppy backing. Very juicy, nice orange, mango aroma emerging from the top of this beaut of a beer. Smell is on point with what you expect from this. 
Taste: The taste is exotic. Fruity, juicy, very very well balanced. Bitter like a DIPA but oh so juicy! The fruit aroma hits the back of your mouth as you're left with an overwhelming sweet, but incredible taste begging for another sip. This my friends, is the filet mignon of DIPAs. 
Feel: feel is wholesome. Very filling, smooth, and pleasant. You can feel the complexity that gets brewed into this beer. From the taste to the feel, this scores 100 all around. 
Overall: The juice filled DIPA proves to be a standard of what craft beer aspires to be. Very, very nice. Lucky to only be 45 min away from this gem of a brewery. 962 charactersCee_McDee, Mar 19, 2017

Haze pours a turbid, pale yellowish orange, looks just like pineapple/orange juice in the glass.  A lasting one finger head.  The smell is big beautiful orange, mango, tropical fruit, a bit of peach.  Taste follows the nose, orange, citrus, tropical fruits, just a touch for dankness hiding in the back.  Very soft bitterness.  The mouthfeel is thick, creamy, like a velvet pillow of fruit in your mouth.  Overall this one of the best IPA/DIPAs I have had, in the top 3 from Treehouse for me, Bright being my favorite.  Goes down oh so easy, no hint of alcohol even though it's 8.2% abv. 621 charactersNugget40, Mar 07, 2017
5/5  rDev +9.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured from a 16 oz can into a tulip glass (1 month old). Appearance is hazy mango/orange juice with one finger thick white head. Smell is tropical fruit/hop juice that hits you in the face with notes of orange, peach, mango, and pineapple. Some light resin and honey is coming trough as well. Taste follows the nose with orange pulp most noticeable. There is a little bit of sweetness and low bitterness. Mouthfeel is soft and creamy with good body upfront and a great bite on the finish. 
Overall, this is probably the best IPAs I have tasted. The tropical fruit and earthy hop flavors are unreal, yet the drinkability and balance are great. The bitterness is perfectly placed, and there is just enough sweetness. Just about perfect all the way around. 755 charactersthatche2, Mar 07, 2017

4.56/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours an opaque  pale yellow with rich two finger head, slowing reducing to a film of bubbles. Decent lacing, some alcohol legs.
Aroma is earthy over tropical, but full of fruit. Lots of citrus, hints of peach and pineapple. Little bit of pine and earth. 
Taste follows the nose though the earthiness is stronger. Little bit of bubblegum going on in there too. Dank resinous bitterness though subdued, and a dry finish.
Mouthfeel is a nice medium body and smooth with higher carbonation than some of their other beers.
Overall this is a tasty DIPA, the dank bitterness, dry finish, and higher carbonation place this above a lot of their other beers for me. 660 charactersHoppy_Time, Feb 22, 2017

Smell: All kinds of fruits in there- peaches, grapefruit, orange, mango, and papaya. A lite spice to go along with it. 
Taste: All the fruits combined with a juicy flavor. The blend is super drinkable with no taste of alcohol for a double IPA
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Feel: Next to no bitter with a little stickiness. Just enough carbonation to add a kick to the drink.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Overall: Another fantastic Tree House brew. I appreciated the higher ABV as I drank my second one. Super juicy fruit taste with little bitterness equals a very drinkable double IPA.⠀⠀ 638 charactersKdouble, Jan 29, 2017

As expected this beer is pretty damn hazy though the light does come through so all is not lost. Perhaps one of the best heads I've seen on a beer. Smells of mango, apricots, ruby red grapefruit, and kiwi ... pithy and rind-like with lots of juice. Super juicy, juice box juicy. Very smooth with some body. A kiss of malt, hops are obviously dominant here. Slight bitterness but it is soft. A bit pungent within all of this juicy character. Love what they did with this brew, keep it going guys!! 534 charactersJason, Jan 20, 2017

4.74/5  rDev +4.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Split a can of this with my roommate and good friend Chris, who snagged it as a trade from his work buddy. Cheers Chris! I've had the privilege of having several Tree House beers in the past, but not this one as far as I recall (I think I'd probably remember having this if I did).
Pours an opaque orange color as expected with a very retentive bone-white head of foam that sticks around at about a finger with some splotchy lace here and there. The head that remains is very consistent and the surface of the beer bears it quite well. Not everyone is into these turbid "milkshake" looking IPAs, but if you are, this is certainly a nice looking one.
Very clean and well-defined hop profile that straddles the line between tropical and citrusy hops very closely. Not much malt here at all other than a subtle wheaty backbone that nevertheless fades behind the hop qualities. I get a lot of peach, orange, grapefruit peel, papaya, mango and even some ripe blueberry in here. Kind of seems like Mosaic combined with some older school hops to me. A tad bit of doughy yeast in there as well.
On the tongue, this is super bright with candied citrus, mango, papaya and other tropical fruits up front followed closely by some more citrus and even a little pine towards the finish as a slight bitterness takes hold. I'm surprised this doesn't drink like an 8+% beer at all; it's very drinkable and even "crushable" although the idea of crushing this is almost blasphemous to me. Pure orange juice in the middle, with some peach and apricot flavors lingering a bit before the mostly dry close. I say mostly dry because there's a slight flash of juiciness even right at the end, alongside a tough and lingering bitterness. Just great.
Drinkability is, of course, very high as well. These guys don't really know how to make a bad IPA, and the combination of heavy amounts of suspended proteins in the final product and oats in the mash give this a soft, smooth feel with a moderate carbonation and chewy body. This doesn't drink anywhere close to 8%, as stated before, so the alcohol presence is fairly muted and doesn't really play into the flavor until the glass gets closer to room temperature. Even then, it's hardly as present as many other lower-ABV DIPAs out there right now. Simply world-class. Love it. 2,303 charactersichorNet, Jan 18, 2017

It was canned today, and pours really  hazy, a very pale orang colour with thin white head. Aroma is nice, very powerful. Juicy (orange, mango, peach), also a hoppy/floral scent as well. It has a really nice scent. Taste is juice. I've never had a beer like it, that tastes so smooth and flavourful. It hides its ABV content and really just goes down easy. I do prefer beers with a more hoppy/floral bite to them, but to each their own. Really nice beer I'm happy to have. Skål 547 charactersraysat, Jan 14, 2017

Appear: poured beautiful orange juice haze with a about a fingers worth of foam that disapiated pretty quickly. gorgeous lacing is left along as you rock the glass.  
Smell: Holy Orange Juice rolls into stone fruit and topical notes some peaches and magoes  great herbal and earthy dankness. there's also some candied orange rind going which is nice.  
Taste: orange creamsicle on the palate. delicious piney sappy notes on the finish. There's also some of the same mango and tropical fruit notes you get on the nose.  The pithy piney notes do build as you sip but not in a bad way.  It actually makes the beer more balanced.  
Mouth: some silky and so smooth.  medium feel.  I don't know that it can get any better.  
Over:  Delicious reminds me of Pineal by Tired Hands.  Great drinking experience.  8.2%  where it's hidden.  Could be 4.2% for what I could tell.  Very well balanced between the great silky juicy notes and the sappy bitter notes.  Great brew.  RIght up my ally. 1,067 charactersGumbo_gravy, Jan 10, 2017

5/5  rDev +9.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Drank the day I brought it home from the brewery out of a TEKU. The line at the brewery was stupid long.
Look: As the name suggests, this beer has a full full haze, deep bright golden color and half a finger of fluffy white head.
Aroma: Classic TH! Big creamsicle aroma along tons of candied citrus, passionfruit and pineapple. 
Taste: Aroma translates to the palate. A little more green on palate than the nose would suggest. Definitely a strong pithy bitterness as well balances the strong up front candied flavors. Finishes with a good amount of hop burn though, the only flaw in this beer.
Mouthfeel: Super crushable for 8.2%. the strong bitter hop burn slices through that thick treehouse creaminess. 
Overall(style points): Another amazing IPA from Treehouse. Killer nose that's on par w/Julius but the strong bitter finish slots it behind Julius making this my second favorite beer from them. 99.25 points! 918 charactersMikeyMcD86, Dec 22, 2016

Sweet up front with orange citrus predominating.  The back end is very balanced and not that bitter at all.  Notes of orange candy linger.  The feel is medium thick.

Where it shines is the hop finish that is lacking in some of the brewery's other popular offerings. The citrus aroma isn't nearly as overpowering as it is in Julius, Green, or Alter Ego. The taste has a better malt/hops balance. The mouthfeel and body are right on par with the best TH has to offer. A fine example of the NE-style pale ale. 397 charactersswanfungus, Nov 04, 2016

4.36/5  rDev -4.2%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Pours an opaque fiery orange with a finger of foamy white head. Head retention is strong with lacing prevalent after each sip. A low volume head is a bit of a disappointment on a high caliber IPA, especially a IIPA. Aroma is dripping with citrus, orange, and resin hops. Very tasty so far. A sip provides a blast of hops, and citrus - in a good way. Notes include citrus, orange, tangerine, and resin. The hops are well managed and balanced, keeping this heavy hitting beer from being difficult to drink. Mouth feel is filling, while only be a medium to medium-thick consistency. Overall, it's a very pleasing beer that is strong across all fronts. The hops are well balanced and thought out. The alcohol taste is well hidden and buried behind a flavorful, powerful beer. 
Served in a 12oz snifter. 799 charactersHarrison8, Oct 29, 2016

S: Orange, peach smell with slight dank/earthy notes. 
T: It has that burst of juicy fruit goodness on the tongue, as if you were to bite into a pineapple or peach. It's almost acidic initially. Like sharp juice bomb. It's followed by a balanced bitter finish. Bit piny and like rinds from fruits
F: It's silky smooth. Medium-full mouth feel for an IPA. Reminds me of Central Water Cassian Sunset mouth feel. Silky.
Overall, it's just a great juice bomb. Glad to have tried my first TH beer. 537 charactersXBeerBellyT, Oct 29, 2016

O: An outstanding brew by its merits, but my weak little Asian stomach can't seem to stomach the magnitude of this brew. I'll perhaps one day (if there ever comes a day when I have the chance to drink this more frequently) grow into this super thick super juicy super saturated haze fad, but as for now this is just too much for me to handle. 728 charactersamano_h, Oct 17, 2016

4.74/5  rDev +4.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Appearance - Pours cloudy pulpy orange color, looks like a glass of orange juice. Nice white head great lacing.
Smell - Mango, orange peel, grapefruit, pineapple and peach. The hops are coming through nicely as well.
Taste - Very juicy topical IPA sweet and very nice hop flavor. The best way I can describe this is someone added fresh hops to freshly squeezed juice. Amazing flavors and very well balanced. Plenty of orange and pineapple as well as mango papaya and grapefruit. This is dangerously drinkable and no sign of the 8.2% ABV.
Feel - Medium body very smooth. Although it is medium body it  still has very full and creamy feel.
Overall - This is an amazing brew, it hits all the notes from the tropical smell and taste to the well balanced hoppiness and smooth feel. 780 charactersDragginballs76, Oct 16, 2016

Smells of fresh citrus hops, pineapple, grapefruit, orange peel, lemon zest, mango, dank piney hops, luscious tropical fruit, graham cracker, biscuit, toasted grains and a general lovely fruity sweetness. All hops but just enough malt backbone to make it almost perfectly balanced.
Tastes pretty much like it smells but with added citrus fruit like papaya, star fruit, grapes and pear. Bitterness is mild and the ABV is completely hidden, making this incredibly easy to drink. Delicious, another home run by Tree House. 717 charactersCHickman, Oct 16, 2016

S: Orange with a little peach and other citrus.
T: Similar to the nose, though not quite as juicy as the smell and a little less sweetness than some of the other TH beers.  You can't really taste the bitterness, and this hides an 8% ABV better than any beer I've ever had this strong.  Delicious.
F: Some carbonation, not as hefty as some other NE IPAs.  But nice. 
O: Great beer, up there with all their others.  The slight decrease in sweetness was actually a positive for my palate the night I drank it. 586 charactersChuckdiesel24, Oct 12, 2016

Appearance includes a very murky yellow orange with a thick, bubbly head with thick lacing on the sides.  Aromas are very apparent with grapefruit, tangerine, and orangepeel smells. Taste follows the nose with an incredibly fruity (citrus mostly) flavor, including a sharp orange aftertaste. The mouthfeel really helps to bring out the flavors by making this beer have a medium carbonation while being very refreshing. Overall, this was a fantastic beer, especially with its aromas. 524 charactersfitzy84, Oct 02, 2016

Milkshake haze orange appearance brings an insane aroma of pineapple, mango orange when I popped open the can.  Taste is mango, orange hoppy goodness with a very boozy finish I was not expecting (but enjoyed).  Overall very crushable the alcohol burn on the finish is what pushed this to almost a 5 for me most juice bombs I have had are a little too sweet.  Will definitely be seeking out a lot more TH in the future. 506 charactersCook82, Sep 27, 2016

Appearance - Pours extremely hazy and orange in color with an off-white, frothy finger width head. Fair retention, resulting in a thin, consistent layer of suds across the surface. Fair lacing, most of which is made up of spotting found around the glass.
Smell - Plenty of juiciness on the nose, with orange, pineapple, lesser peach and a hint of spice.
Taste - Follows the nose. Juicy notes of orange and pineapple upfront, following shortly with lesser notes of peach and mango. A touch of hop spice and some stonefruit pit nuttiness mid-taste. The back end rings with fair grapefruit pith and some light, bready sweetness.
Mouthfeel - Medium-bodied with moderate carbonation. Smooth drinker, though a touch of chalkiness (presumably from the yeast) in the texture. 
Overall - One heck of a NE-style DIPA, and certainly one of the trendsetters of the style. If there's one knock, it may be a bit too yeasty, but I'm nitpicking. This is a damn tasty brew. 985 charactersTheSixthRing, Sep 26, 2016

The smell hits your nose right as you open the can. Notes of mango, pineapple, guava, grapefruit, and orange. Also getting a slightly weedy aroma as well. Taste is majorly up front with pineapple, mango, and guava, with bitter grapefruit and orange zest coming through towards the end. Alcohol is slightly noticeable. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. Carbonation is slightly low but helps with the overall mouthfeel. Overall, an amazing NE DIPA. It has that typical tropical taste and smooth feel you'd expect from breweries like Tree House, Trillium, and Monkish. 639 charactersMisSigsFan, Sep 22, 2016

Aroma is fruity orange/pineapple juice very hoppy and wonderful smelling. Slight grassiness and overall hop pellet feel with a touch of alcohol. As it breathes even more tropical hop scents emerge.
Taste is more of the same orange juice meets pineapple, mango, cantaloupe, honeydew with slight yeastiness and bitter lingering grassy pith/pulp.
Medium in body with modest carbonation. This has a creamy yeast filled feel that goes down easy. Despite tasting similar to just about every other hoppy thing ive had from tree house, this one brings a little brighter pop of fruity quality. Hell yea id drink it again if offered. This goes down crazy easy, never would have guessed it at 8%. 888 charactersstakem, Sep 20, 2016

Pours a profoundly turbid orange-grapefruit colour with a generous finger of lush, creamy head. Retention is just pretty good but leaves a rich, enduring skim of suds and thick sheets of lacing. From a classical standpoint, this beer is butt-ugly; to the aficionado of NEIIPA's, it is a beverage of surpassing beauty.
The nose is sugar cookies, peaches, pineapples, and sweaty sex in a weedy ditch.
Tastes of soft, juicy, fruity yeast. Dank herbal notes, fresh white bread, pineapple, grapefruit pith, orange zest and a melange of various fermented (read boozy) tropical fruits. Ends with grass clippings and a little pine tingle.
The feel is oily and medium-heavy, very juicy but well carbonated.
All (maybe just almost all?) of the Tree House PA's share that signature, instantly-identifiable peachy-bubblegum-yeasty-somethingness and Haze is no exception. The booze is quite prominent on this one, maybe a little too much so but, otherwise, it's just SO damn good that it's hard to ding it too much for that. 1,085 characterspapposilenus, Sep 10, 2016

Smell: Pungent fruit hops burst from the can. Notes of peach, pineapple, papaya, guava, and grapefruit dominate the nose. All hops. 
Taste: Thick juicy hops buckle the tongue with notes of peach, pineapple, grapefruit pith, papaya, and guava. This slowly fades to a honey biscuit malt with a lingering bitter pine as it finishes. 
Feel: Thick and juicy yet not abrasive. Light bitter on the finish and just a hint of alcohol on the finish. Very drinkable for the ABV.
Overall: One intense IIPA. Big, juicy, and tongue buckling. Yet drinks way below its actual ABV. The flavors develop over the course of the sip adding an unexpected complexity that just adds to the beauty of this beer. It's not just juice it has a notable malt and layers to the hops. World class stuff. 820 charactersBergBeer, Sep 06, 2016

Hazy, almost pastel orange colour. Appears practically radioactive. Screaming juicy and it doesn't disappoint. Strong blood orange aroma. Taste is well balanced. Oranges with a bit of peach. Not too sweet or acidic. Soft mouth feel with considerable body. A real thrill to drink this! 381 charactersdabeerbuddha, Aug 30, 2016

Pours hazy pale yellow. Closely resembles grapefruit juice with a one-inch off-white head that remains as a cap on top and leaves strands of lace on the drink down. The smell is of fresh squeezed citrus juicy with some faint tropical fruit accents. The taste follows with juicy grapefruit and a hint of pine bitterness. Full texture. World class. 366 charactersFurlinator, Aug 28, 2016

A- Cloudy orange juice looking with a fluffy white one finger head. Sticky lacing left after every sip.
S- Apricot, peach, mango, pineapple. Throw in all the tropical fruits you can think of. Slightly resinous.
T- Another fruit juice in beer form from Tree House. Mango, papaya, peach....you get the picture. Perfect amount of bitterness. Slight alcohol warming. Great stuff.
M- Medium to full and smooth. Perfect amount of carbonation. Silky.
O- Like all the Tree House IPA's I have tried, I love it. Recommended if you can get it. 560 charactersnodder, Aug 26, 2016

The pour is a hazy looking yellow color under a modest white foamy head.  Lingering head. 
The aroma brings out orange, tangerine, peach, and citrus character mainly but there is still a worthwhile toasted bread and biscuit character worth mentioning. Zero booze for 8.2%.
Medium to full body but so smooth.
The peach jumps forward in the taste but is usurped by the other fruity character and toasted bread sweetness that hovers under it all.  Mostly clean finish.  Just delightful and worth waiting in line to grab one. 604 characterspuboflyons, Aug 24, 2016

Aroma : this aroma is fucking crazy. Pure peach bomb from yeast, then tropical fruits from hops. 
Mouthfeel : medium-medium.
Flavor : this is my second dipa from TH so its hard to tell, but they are all "boozy" and I dont like that. Trillium perfectly hides the alcohol taste, but this has a sharp alcohol taste at the start, other tastes are great thi.
Overall : the booziness ruins everything, wish they make a regular version of this. Sad. 528 charactersnerdboy19, Aug 21, 2016

Exotic flavors shine through - notes of fruit, mango, orange, rine - seems to be a staple with Treehouse.    Tastes extremely similar to the Julius - smooth, refreshing, definite dankness to this one, hops shine through, but the fruit definitely is at the front of the flavors.   The fruit blends in and is in balance with the malt backbone.. it all works - beautifully.
All in all a great beer - didn't change my life, but was an amazing offering from Treehouse.   Can't wait to have more of these and continue trying some different beers from Treehouse. 639 charactersFinestofNewEngland, Aug 15, 2016

4.98/5  rDev +9.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5Canned 8/3. Consumed 8/11.
A: Pours out a bright golden orange. Sits completely opaquely in the glass, a murky and turbid yet still vibrant heavily burnt orange. 
S: Tons of orange. Spritzy OJ mixed with pithy, astringent orange pith. Tropical and stone fruit undertones—peach, passionfruit, mango. Bit of grassy dankness as well. Significant backing of sweet white-bready malt.
T: Sweet, delectable citrus juice up front. Orange with tons of lemon and lime throughout. Explodes off the tongue initially, but succumbs relatively quickly to a milder assortment of tropical fruits—papaya, peach, passionfruit. An herbaceous and bitter finish combats any noticeable sweetness from the malts, imparting a well-balanced and almost cocoa powder-esque quality to the finish.
M: Rich and luscious, very reminiscent of the feel on Green. Bubblegum yeastiness hints at a milkshake-esque feel. A bit more bitter—though more floral than piney or astringent—on the finish, but a welcome bitterness in its balance of the sweet, doughy malt that sits further in the foreground on Haze than it does in other TH brews. It's not quite as thick and full as Green, but it's pretty close.
O: Up there with anything else I’ve tried from Tree House. Haze pops in both the flavor and aroma categories, packing a punch of orange juiciness that is pretty much unrivaled in its intensity. I’ve heard Haze aptly described as a fusion of some of the defining characteristics of Julius and Green, and I totally see this. It embodies an amped up version of Julius’ orange qualities while mirroring the mid-mouth doughy bubblegum flavor and herbaceous bitter finish of Green. It’s really hard to find anything wrong with this beer, and I’d gladly drink it over pretty much anything else I’ve ever had. Damn near perfect. 1,813 charactersavas, Aug 12, 2016

L: 2F+ typical Treehouse head with long retention, lacing, cap, and ring. Beer is hazy orange juice color. Don't leave it around your kids :)
S: It smells wonderful from 4 feet away. Closer in, you get orange, grapefruit, pineapple, and peach. There's also an earthiness on the back end that seems to be part of all Treehouse beers (something in the water in Monson?)
T: Just a juicebomb: orange, grapefruit, pineapple, peach, lime up front with a dank earthy finish. This is really very nice. I do get a tiny bit of alcohol heat on the finish.
F: Medium body, light to medium carbonation. Good drying on palate. Very solid construction and balance. 
O: Would be really hard for me to choose between this and Julius if I had to. I tend to go with the DIPAs over the IPAs when pressed, but both are so good. It's no wonder they blazed through 1200 customers the day I got these cans. 950 charactersIvoryFoxhole, Aug 09, 2016

It just has everything.  Look is like any other IPA from TH.  The smell and taste is tropical fruits but has an explosion of pineapple and grapefruit half way through swallowing it.  The slight dankness and bitterness at the end makes this beer so refreshing.  Feel is easily my favorite from TH as it coats slightly better than the other 3 (Julius, Green, and Alter).  
Overall, my favorite regular offering nowadays but Julius is a close second.  A must trade for IMO. 551 charactersBEEPOP, Aug 04, 2016

S-Dank, hop, floral all rolled into one. Why can't Yankee Candle make this scent?
T-Mirrors smell. Floral notes pepper the palate and leaves a smooth grapefruit finish with zero aftertaste.
F-Hits like a double. Heavy at first but smooth finish gives amnesia about heavy beginning.
O-Simply put a winner. Worth the 1-2 hour wait at brewery for growler. Drink this beer you will not regret it 482 charactersMichaelmartin85, Jul 23, 2016

Pours a hazy orange semi-cloudy brew.  Not as thick looking as some of their other beers.  Thick lacing that hangs on the glass. 
Smells like citrus and hops.  Peach, passion fruit, All the things they are known for but with a little more bite from the double.  
Taste is amazing.  It follows the nose with fruit, citrus and a nice touch of hops.  
Mouth feel is smooth.  Love the way it hangs on the tongue.  
Overall, another great offering.   Love tree house.  It's not hype and NE style juice IPAs are awesome.  Glad I went there and stood in the line to get it. 671 charactersJay_P22, Jul 23, 2016

4.5/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Traded for this beer a little while back and wanted to have a full can of this after taking a sip of this in the Other Half line. Can dated 4/20 (ha!) with "Alright X 3" written below it as this still tasted fresh when I finally gave it a go today. No floaties as the haze was still present but not overpowering, indicating that there wasn't any massive sediment in this. Even though the Julius was more popular and the first beer that I had from Tree House, I liked this more as it wasn't as potent and was much more balanced, making it easier to sip without being hit over the head by juice and hops!
Lovely pour to this as the beer had the aforementioned hazy shine to it, with a muted golden hue, massive head, and tons of soapy lacing left on my pint glass. Mostly orange on the nose, to go along with the yeast, some booze, and candied tangerine sweetness. All of those were in the taste, which had to be one of the most appealing and pleasing that I've ever had in a beer. The spice from the grapefruit kicked in pretty quickly, followed by a good piney mouthfeel, dank weed, a bit of garlic, and lots of tropical fruits. Slick, moderate in carbonation, and wonderfully balance, the earthy hops were a nice base to the wide range of flavors on top that meshed wonderfully together. 
Plenty of booze here but with so much to enjoy here, who's to notice? There was just the right amount of juice and sweetness here and I didn't need a glass of water to chase this down with. Beers like this come around once in a blue moon and I can't wait to get my hands on this again. With everything in near-perfect proportion, what's not to love? 1,641 charactersJerzDevl2000, Jul 18, 2016

Haze has an intense and powerful aroma. Nicely dank, the "purple haze" connotation is spot the fuck on. Sticky, spicy, herbal, cannabic aromas are complemented and maybe even toned down a touch by a cedar forest, sticky juicy peach, and pineapple upside-down cake.
Earthy flavor, like peanut brittle or caramel corn, is followed by biscuit, and quickly overtaken by herbal, spicy young pine and copious amounts of sweet orange and young, fresh nectarine, almost white peach.
Tangy, tingly and crisp, this is not the heavy IPA that it looks like. 601 charactersSabtos, Jul 09, 2016

4.56/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured at 50°F from a pint can (canned on 20Apr16) into a Spiegelau IPA glass. Consumed on 29May16.
LOOK: Three fingers to a finger within 3 minutes. Dull yellow in color with an extreme amount of cloudiness. Plethora of small rising bubbles. Lacing is subtle and very thick.
SMELL: Huge aromas of mango, papaya, peach, guava, and apricot commingle with strong aromas of spicy hops, orange, grapefruit, and tangerine along with mild white bread, earthy yeast, and piney hop aromas.
TASTE: Very strong flavors of mango, papaya, guava, peach, and apricot first burst on to the palate. The taste is amplified as strong piney hop, spicy hop, orange, grapefruit, and tangerine flavors immediately follow. Balance is finally achieved as mild white bread and earthy yeast along with subtle bitter hop flavors finish off the taste theatrical as all previous flavors press on. 
FEEL: Somewhere between full-bodied and medium-bodied. Carbonation is mild. Goes down smooth and somewhat creamy. Finishes with a strong and unpleasant dryness.
NOTE: Most people who have traversed the craft universe know that Tree House does no wrong. With this being my third offering from them, I can agree--with certainty-- to that statement. I have yet to try any of their bigger brews, but I greatly look forward to those one day. 1,306 charactersMyotus, May 30, 2016

Taste is orange, tangerine, peach, and dank wet hops.  The orange really jumps as the beer warms.  Super light bodied for the style.  No beer with this high an ABV has the right to be this smooth.  Of the ten or so Tree House brews I have had and it may be the best IPA I have ever had.   Just an amazing beer. 417 characterstigg924, May 28, 2016

4.46/5  rDev -2%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5With the balance of pale ale but with the complexity, intensity and strength of imperial ale, Tree House brewers push the limits on hop aroma and flavor while keeping the bitter-to-sweet ratio a little closer to even-keel.
Once again, the New England-style IPA rears its ugly head with the murk of a mud puddle and looks like the tarnish gold of vegemite. A plethora of citrus, tropical and orchard fruits churn from the dense ecru froth and entice the nose with promises of fruit, tartness and bittersweetness. Honey, caramel and crusty key-lime pie come to mind as the ale creeps onto the tongue.
Its bright fruit bouquet transitions to taste immediately with red grapefruit, tangerine, nectarine, pineapple, mango, passionfruit, lime, lemon and kiwi. Canteloupe and a berry-like tang rounds out the fruitiness of the esters and hops while the persestent sweetness within coats the middle palate with layers of fructose, angel-food cake and succulent honey. As the ale turns to take a bitter stride, the taste of fresh shavings of pine and sassafras weave in to command the sweetness with a fresh grassiness, herbal dankness and a curious taste of cannabis.
Medium-full in body, the beer's imperial heft keeps the ale richer and fuller, and resists any convincing turn to dryness, bitterness or elevated crispness. What the palate gets in return is the full malt balance that gives the hops a more rounded and more complex flavor. An aftertow of herb and citrus have a warm alcohol spice counterpart in a long cream-sickle finish. 1,535 charactersBEERchitect, May 12, 2016

4.48/5  rDev -1.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Straight pour from a 16oz can to an oversized wineglass (TH stemware, for those curious). There’s a canning date of May 2, 2016 printed in black ink on the underside of the can, which reads “KEEP COLD  05 02 16  SUHH DUDE”—which would make this five days old at the time of consumption. This was purchased at the brewery on the 4th, and it immediately went into the fridge so these are essentially ideal tasting circumstances. 
Appearance (4.5): Two very full fingers of creamy, custard-colored foam rise happily off of the pour, capping a cloudy, orange and honey-colored body. The head dies down relatively slowly, leaving scattered suds near the peak of the head, a half-finger collar, and a diminutive clump of foam near the center.  As the body goes down, it leaves a solid sheath of foam on the far side of the glass, with peaks and valleys in its profile. 
Smell (4.5): Positively pungent, nectar-like citrus dominates the nose: musky papaya flesh, sticky mango juice, and passion fruit. It blends smoothly with sugar cookie-like sweetness, country bread, and earthy tones paired with a slightly grassy aroma. A dank, weedy note brings up the rear. As it warms, it shifts more toward passion fruit and sauvignon blanc-like gooseberry notes, as well as a much stronger musk. This is seriously excellent stuff. 
Taste (4.5): This shit is bonkers. I’m not entirely sure what’s going on here, honestly—it starts off with a combination of papaya muskiness and a kind of earthy, bready component. A little bit of guava and strawberry come out, followed by passion fruit, a limeade mix of citric tartness and light, balancing sweetness, and pink grapefruit flesh with sugar sprinkled on top. A grassy note mixes in at this point, making for a slightly cannabis-like feel. All throughout, a layer of sugar cookie sweetness tempers any bitterness, helping to accentuate the fruitiness of it all. Amazingly, there’s no noticeable booziness in the flavor, thought a slight spiciness does come up in the finish. 
Mouthfeel (4.25): Smooth, slick, and somewhat on the full- side of medium-weight, with a juicy, nectar-like feel. Still, the oily hop presence dries out the feel significantly just as the beer finishes. All throughout, the carbonation is fine-grained, subtle, and smooth, matching the body’s thickness with its creamy feel. The alcohol appears here just a bit, with a boozy dryness that blends in with the hop bitterness. Smooth and satisfying, with a feel that matches its heft and hop load. 
Overall (4.5): This is, in the end, an outstanding, smooth, supremely fruity, satisfying DIPA. This is, effectively, New England-style hop juice, and there’s not an unpleasant thing about it, but it does lack some of the depth and complexity of my very favorite DIPAs. NOT THAT I AM COMPLAINING FOR EVEN A SECOND—just explaining what might separate this from the most world-class of world-class DIPAs. This is still, in every single way, an absolute joy to drink. I’m guessing it goes without saying . . . but this is highly recommended. 3,068 charactersfmccormi, May 10, 2016

One of my all-time favorite beers Tree House brews. Pours a hazy orange like most Tree House IPA's are know for but not as thick in appearance as say their Julius is. As other reviewers have said it drinks like a beer with a much lower ABV (8.2). Tons of lacing and the ever present aroma of orange, mango and peach. Just and amazing all around beer. 401 charactersUnfiltered413, May 08, 2016

The color is like fresh pressed juice with white head and fine bead with lots of lace clinging in rings with good retention. The smell is so juicy-you might believe there is actual fruit in this - very tropical! the smell has a citrus quality with lemony and lightly grassy zesty smell that brings out herbal and subtle stone fruit accents. The feel is great - fruity and tangy with medium carbonation and semi-sweet entry yet juicy tangy and bitter balances out with a semi-dry yet very light astringent aspect with a long hop finish.
The taste is as great as the smell hints at just a lovely mix of sweet citrus and tropical fruit flavors in the hops with a very mild malt to supplement that juicy taste and soft bitter accent with a more herbal/sweetgrass taste in the back with malt and bitterness more balanced in order that there is no alcohol in the taste. Overall I found this to be smooth, drinkable fresh and lively as far as the intensity of the hop flavor and it is very quaffable for a 8.2% beer I was able to sip and enjoy this very easily looking forward to future tastes of this fine brew. 1,266 charactersSlatetank, May 04, 2016
4/5  rDev -12.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4This beer is good but certainly not in my top 10 for DIPAs. It looks hazy as expected with a nice orange hue. It has good citrus smells and flavor with a slightly dank bitter aftertaste which again is good but not great. There are so many breweries that aren't hyped up nearly as much as TH that do it better (for example Cellarmaker). Other than Julius, which is an excellent yet one dimensional juice bomb, I don't see why everyone is going so ape shit over this brewery. 473 charactersELS, May 04, 2016

Thanks, KC! 
Pours a cloudy pale gold with a big, billowing white foam cap that sticks around very well, big globs and rings of lacing.  The aroma is a mix of juicy melon, orange, mango, pungent green hops and a biscuity malt backbone.  The flavor is right on the smell's heels but a lot oilier and stankier as far as the hops are concerned; orange pith, grapefruit, soft mango flavors, melon and a final wave of dank, resinous hop cone oiliness.  Medium body, active carbonation, fairly drinkable with a lingering sappy/sweaty finish.  
This is a very good beer that I throughly enjoyed. It has a little something that sets it aside from other IPAs from TH as well as other beers that I have had.  I could just describe it as sweaty.  Both in taste and smell is is fruity, it is juicy, it is resinous, but there is a lingering undercurrent of a pungent, almost-sharp tang of funky dank hop stank.  It is good, but it is also the one thing that keeps it from being more drinkable for me, especially since it is tied to the bitter oily finish.  Fabulous beer.  
I would definitely have it again. 1,148 charactersTheDoctor, May 01, 2016

Appearance - Living up to its name, Haze is... hazy. This is pretty much the de facto description of the appearance for all Tree House IPAs so far. It seems to be a little lighter in appearance than either Julius or Sap. The head is very foamy and long-lasting.
Aroma - The nose brimming with juicy notes from the fresh hops and the peach aroma is through the roof. A pulpy orange note follows next like a glass of freshly-squeezed O.J. and just the faintest hint of pine at the end.
Taste - Finally, a Tree House beer that tastes as good as it smells. The hops are obviously the most dominant flavor here, but it is all juicy goodness; there is almost no bitterness at all despite the high alcohol and hop dosage. Again, I'm getting tons of peach, orange, pine sap, and other tropical fruits that it's pretty crazy actually. Perhaps a tiny bit of malt backbone as well, but who needs it when the hops carry the flavor as well as this does?
Mouthfeel - The mouthfeel is medium-bodied with good carbonation. Tree House nails the body perfectly once again, with a soft texture that accentuates the hops. This is probably the lightest DIPA I've had.
Closing Arguments - Overall, this is far-and-away the best Tree House beer I've had so far that I could actually sit down with and analyze. Lights On may give it a run for its money, but that was at a tasting, so different circumstances there. Whereas Julius and Sap didn't live up to their billing, Haze carries the standard and doesn't relinquish it in the flavor. If I had this blind, there's no way I'd peg it as anywhere close to 8%. Dangerously crushable for sure. 1,712 charactersnhindian, Apr 28, 2016
4.32/5  rDev -5.1%look: 5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25L - hazy - as advertised. good lacing on the glass, lighter towards the top and grows deeper in the snifter.
S- wonderful. papaya, mango, tropical, very very strong nose.
T - the beer does not sip as strong fruity forward as the smell as the bite at the end is bitter and lingers. Lots of resiny earthy pine in the finish that lingers long.  almost so much so that it overpowers everything else though the more you drink it the more the other notes come off the sidelines and take hold. 
F -  does not feel like 8.2 at all, light, fluffy. very good here.
O - this is my first crack at tree house and it is very very good. almost a jeckyl and hyde type situation where the smell is so citrus and the finish is so earthy dank but they pull it together nicely. the more you sip it the more you get from it too. great stuff. 820 charactersbeantown_hopster, Apr 28, 2016

Absolutely incredible. Taste is the same with a bit of bitterness on the finish. Feel is light side of medium, soft and juicy with a sticky finish. Overall this beer is absolutely immaculate. The best double IPA I've ever had by a pretty wide margin. 534 charactersCNoj012, Apr 25, 2016

L - True to the name, Haze pours a very hazy, almost opaque orange, with a thin film of pearl-white head that dissipates and leaves some streaking on the glass and surface. The color and opacity resembles freshly squeezed orange juice, in a way.
S - There's a distinct sweetness on the first whiff that reminds me of nectarines and peaches, followed by more subtle notes of papaya and a hint of orange. The sharper citrus notes that are typical of hop bombs are missing, and in its place is a slight touch of honey. As expected, there's a pretty strong earthy dankness backing up all of scents, making for an overall smell that's more warm and comforting than tropical and refreshing like most IPAs. Different, but still very nice.
T - The tropical papaya notes come through pretty clearly on the first sip, which is followed by a slight maltiness. Not the most refreshing or juicy of IPAs, but definitely still very enjoyable. Finished with a strong dash of hop resin, which comes across slightly more bitter than crisp. It has all the right components of a great DIPA, but somehow, it's not making a huge impression on me. Admittedly, this might be because I've been drinking some fantastically fresh IPAs lately (Other Half Stacks on Stacks, Grimm Tesseract, Heady Topper, etc.).
F - Mouthfeel is pretty consistent with all the other characteristics. Moderately fine carbonation brings a spritz that complements the hoppiness, and a slight viscosity of the liquid itself goes along with the smell and look.
O - I can't exactly say I'm disappointed by Haze, since it's still a very good double IPA. Definitely not as impressive as the other Tree House IPA I've had so far though (Bright), and some of its contemporary DIPAs that I mentioned earlier. I would get this again, but there are other beers that I've had before that I'd be more keen on acquiring more of. 1,917 charactershowielchen8, Apr 18, 2016

It smells of a sun-baked, two week overdue litter box and tastes like a combination of mango, papaya, and guava juice mixed with alley cat urine. I suspect the carefully selected hop mixture has a neurotoxic effect on the brain that forces formerly astute beer drinkers to stand in line for hours awaiting their Great Depression era rations of this sludge. Chemical engineering and marketing genius. Looks like beer. Feel is tough to judge because it is forcefully ejected from my mouth before I have much time to ponder the oral sensation of this prized brew. Three cans sampled over eight months. 686 charactersPaleAleHater, Apr 13, 2016

4.85/5  rDev +6.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Tasting my fourth tree house IPA ever. Only other ones I've had are green, alter ego, Julius, and this one. So I'll go head and make a few comparisons.
Pour is a beautiful murky, cloud orange. Seems to be a little more straw yellow than the other offerings I've had. Nice tight white bubbles head, great lacing on the glass. 
Smell seems to be the medium in the most hoppy, resinous TH I've had (Julius), and the fruitier tropical Green. Soon as you crack the can, you get whiffs of peach, orange, tangerines and papaya. Then again you still get that slight resinous smell in the back end, reminiscent of marijuana and sweet malt. Besides the tropical fruit and hop resin I'm getting some nice honey as well.
Taste is an interesting blend of all the smells I got in the nose, tropical goodness like peaches, papaya and tangerines. But the most unique about Haze is its honey/sweet nectar quality. Definitely has a subtle sweet floral taste to it. Hop profile definitely isn't dominant. Sweet malt profile as well.
Mouthfeel doesn't come as a surprise. Not as much as a fruit dole feel like Green, but a more organic orange juice feel.
Overall, quite possibly my favorite TH I've had so far. Not as much of a fruity bomb as Green, not as much hop profile as Julius. Kind of the medium, like alter ego. But with a more honey/nectar flavor. Lovely beer. 1,355 charactersMateo2699, Apr 13, 2016

It looks like pineapple juice but a little darker and more orange.  Small, white head, which dissipated quickly, leaving moderate lacing.  The smell is strong oranges - almost smells like orange juice - with a hoppiness coming through underneath.  The mouthfeel is very smooth with medium carbonation.  The taste is strong citrus - orange, and some grapefruit - but the hop presence is much stronger than I expected from the smell.  In no way is any one flavor overpowering. This beer is incredibly balanced with no hint of alcohol.  Overall, this beer is fantastic and very easy to drink.  I completely understand the hype on the beer, and Tree House, if all their IPAs follow the quality of this one.  Every taste gives me a little hint of different flavors.  I'll definitely look for more from them, given the chance. 919 charactersjvgoor3786, Apr 10, 2016

This element really puts them above all the rest. Haze is no different. It's a nice rounded navel orange haze bomb with the aroma of grapefruit. The taste is much more tropical than most of their other releases. As stated in the description papaya comes through along with guava, dragon fruit, and some pineapple in addition to the citrus of grapefruit and orange. The feel is incredibly smooth with that chewy cream. Stellar beer. 530 charactersTrevor11, Apr 07, 2016

Smell: Citrus. Mango?. Definitely orange peel and maybe some lemon.
Taste: More of those citrus flavors. Mostly getting orange and nectarine. 
Feel: Fairly balanced bitterness but still quite the citrus bite up front. Slightly creamy but not thick.
Overall: It is a great DIPA but the market is flooded. This exceeds others because of how well it masks the ABV. 509 charactersdhitchcox, Apr 04, 2016

4.94/5  rDev +8.6%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This would normally be 5's across, but Very Hazy exists.
L: Incredibly turbid, murky pineapple with tons of head.
S: Tropical fruit juice, bubblegum, hint of dank. It's a little subtle, but most TH beers are, which is different at first, but really grows on  you.
T: It's not technically a 5 as Very Hazy is just a hair better, but it's better than 4.75. Tropical juice, pineapple, bit of dankness and greenery to balance. Somewhat subtle, but it makes the beer crazy drinkable. It's hard to not chug.
F: Perfect. Full and creamy with light carb.
O: My favorite standard TH beer. I enjoy it more than Green as it has a robust hop dankness  as opposed to Green's zesty, clove like hop character. It's nearly just as good as Very Hazy, but that's just a hint more intense. 775 characterscultclassic89, Mar 26, 2016

Aroma is very tropical, lots of mango, pineapple with some grapefruit, peach, and melon. Taste is much like the aroma with huge mango notes upfront, changing to pineapple, with melon in the finish. Good mouthfeel, medium-light body and moderate carbonation yield a pillowy mouthfeel. Overall this is another great example of a New England style IPA from Tree House but I just find this to be too juicy for my tastes. 505 charactersmnj21655, Mar 25, 2016

4.77/5  rDev +4.8%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Can shared by Curran last night, thanks man.
This one pours a hazy (duh) and turbid honey orange color, with a half inch head, and a little bit of lacing.
Smells fantastically hoppy and fruity, with lots of orange, and grapefruit, mango, and pineapple, with some dankness and pine and that sort of thing.
This is probably the best Tree House beer that I've had. It balances pretty deftly the big juicy hop character that most Tree House beers have, with a nice level of dank marijuana type flavors, a hefy bitterness, but also a big juice blast. There's some grapefruit, orange, pineapple, and mango, and TONS of it. This is absolutely delicious.
This has a nice crisp and creamy mouthfeel, with a great level of drinkability.
My favorite beer yet from Tree House, a stunner. 780 charactersGreesyFizeek, Mar 21, 2016

Look: Golden haze. This is the perfect beer. (10/10)
Smell: Swamp, fruit, hops, sweet, sweat, funk, sugar, cotton candy, bubble gum. (10/10)
Taste: Perfectly sweet, reminds me of a milkshake. Hoppy, Malty, perfect balance. Cotton candy, Bubble Gum, Spice, Herb, Weed. (10/10)
Feel: Mediocre bite at first that mellows out with sweetness. Just enough alcohol, hops, malt, yeast. (10/10)
Overall: This is my favorite offering from Treehouse. A stronger DIPA with a nice fruit complexity to balance out the Malt and ABV, it's hard to stop drinking this one. If you have the opportunity to try this one, I highly recommend it. Like MBC Dinner with an explosion of fruit and candy. (10/10) 741 characterscurtis6290, Mar 19, 2016

Reviewed 03/02/16
Straw/lemon yellow and the name does not disappoint, hazy and murky. Thinnish, 1 finger white head almost like a nitro.
Smell slightly underwhelming. Fruits
Pineapple and mango BOMB, no malt backbone to be found yet not bitter at all other than a little grapefruit deeper into the pint. Delicious.
Well carbonated and not cloying, edging on dry for the ABV.
Fantastic beer. Can't wait to share with others. 445 charactersmusicsherlock, Mar 02, 2016
4.6/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Similar vibe to Julius, which I had just a day earlier. Same juicy flavors on the nose. However, unlike Julius where these orange and mango flavors are the star, in Haze the hops take center stage and the juice is the supporting cast. Same great unfiltered look and lovely mouth feel exist here as well. Very nicely done. 321 charactersBierRunner, Mar 02, 2016
4.8/5  rDev +5.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Not usually a big fan of IPAs or IIPAs because they are so often bitter more than anything else. This had plenty of lush citrus flavours, good acidity, and lush mouthfeel to balance out a surprisingly modest bitter finish. I could drink this and Heady any day of the week with no complaints. 291 charactersAus_Nomad, Mar 01, 2016

It has the unmistakable Tree House creaminess and amazing smell when you pop a fresh can.  Juicy, but less bitter than their other IIPAs. Definitely tastes better after a week or two like most canned hops, IMO. 247 charactersJslay013, Feb 25, 2016

4.71/5  rDev +3.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Another superior Tree House offering. A little less fruity and a little more hoppy at the end than Julius or Alter Ego. Has that cloudy honey-orange color that announces that unfiltered goodness is on the way. Fantastic nose - mango, citrus, touch of pine. Taste says tangerine and pine to me with some softer fruits.  Strong hops bitterness follows. Mouth feel - nice carbonation, then soft flow over the tongue, finishes with a lingering bitterness. Fruit flavors emerge more as beer warms a bit. Nice, appropriate carbonation. 
Bottom line - another world class beer. For me, among the citrus-style DIPAs and IPAs, Tree House is the absolute king of the mountain.  Now if they could only move closer to Virginia.... 719 characters11-52_4hops, Feb 20, 2016

Look: Hazy and orange, but a bit darker than other Tree House brews I've had. Almost looks like a non-alcoholic apple cider. Poured a half-finger of white head that quickly fell into almost nothing. Sparse lacing.
Smell: Peach and apricot off the bat. Definitely get some tangerine, guava, and mango too. Noticeable pine too; not as much as Green but more than Julius. Probably the best balance of fruit and pine characters of the TH beers I've had. Dankness really cuts through as it warms.
Taste: Just as balanced as the nose. Pine and citrus working in almost perfect tandem. Extraordinarily bitter aftertaste. Not unpleasant, but noteworthy, in my opinion. The fruit really comes to the forefront as it sits out and warms up a bit.
Feel: Fairly high carbonation that dances and explodes in your mouth. Medium to thick mouthfeel that foams and froths, coating the mouth. The finish is clean and a little alcoholic.
Overall: Another top-tier beer from Tree House, surprise surprise. It seems that these guys and gals can do no wrong. Not my favorite offering thusfar, but honestly it really becomes a splitting of hairs when you're dealing with beer of this caliber. By no means would I decline the opportunity to purchase this in future visits. 1,320 charactersPCole, Feb 11, 2016

Served in a snifter
A finger tall, frothy white crown topped the opaque, orangey-amber liquid. Although the beer is called "Haze," the body on this could clearly be categorized as "cloudy." In fact, it looked very much like orange juice. The head quickly fell to a barely there film. Drippy streaks of lacing trickled down the glass.
The aroma was really hoppy and bright. Tropical fruits came through strong right off the bat. Loads of passionfruit. Good amount of mango. Peach notes were apparent as well. Lots of zesty orange and orange peel. Juicy and fruity. As the beer sat, the orange notes took over. Later, the peach really came forth.
The flavor profile was solid but more pithy and simple than the nose. Intense citrus notes. Orange peel dominated. Really juicy and fresh. Just a touch bitter. Peach notes also came through strong. Bit of mango. White grapefruit appeared in the finish. Fairly rind-like and moderately bitter. Some pithiness lingered after the swallow.
On the palate, the beer was medium bodied. Perhaps a bit thinner than anticipated. The liquid contained a very fine, mellow effervesce that tuned the beer creamy and frothy on the palate. This almost felt a bit under carbonated.
Haze is a really solid, citrus-forward double IPA, but it is far from Tree House's most impressive hoppy offering. By most accounts, this would be an amazing shelf beer, but by Tree House standards it was a bit disappointing. 1,525 charactersDamian, Feb 05, 2016

Hazed and murky honey colored with an orangey-beige head that recedes slowly, leaving a quarter inch cap of foam.
Aroma of honey, florals, tangerine and mint.  A mix of sweet and hoppy.
Muted hop flavor upfront, not very bright, mix of florals and tangerine and mint (sound familiar?), some grapefruit and tangerine.  Semi-sweet honey malt rides beneath.
Full but somewhat slick mouthfeel.  Good beer but the Tree House beers are all starting to taste the same to me. 507 charactersfar333, Jan 31, 2016

Millions of peaches. That's the smell I get first. A bit of earthy dank and oranges. Passion fruit starburst taste. But the mild earthiness keeps it in check from total juice bomb. Hint of pine. Nice wet feel. Mild carbonation and a bit of zest. Another great beer from TH. 386 charactersHootie159, Jan 30, 2016

Smell:  Stone fruit (peach, nectarine and apricot) mirrored by orange and tangerine citrus tones
Taste:  On the tastebuds, the citrus shows more power, with orange creamsicle forward, tangy passion fruit and more subtle stone fruit flavors underneath; after the swallow, a dank bitterness builds but the malt stays in the background
Mouthfeel:  Medium to full body with moderate carbonation
Overall:  Another fine example of how to brew with hops from Tree House 645 charactersbrentk56, Jan 28, 2016

Appearance- Pours a foamy two finger head.  Orange in color and incredibly hazy and dense. No visibility whatsoever.  
Aroma- Pineapple, guava, sweet grapefruit, a little spicy/herbal, and a bready malt.
Taste- Big fruity hops upfront with pineapple, orange, and citrus being most notable.  Middle sees some grapefruit flavor and bitterness set in.  The finish is very dry with a big bready malt rounding things out. 
Feel- Very soft,medium bodied, medium carbonation, and a dry finish with some oily hops lingering.
Overall- Really enjoy the Treehouse Ipa's that strike a balance between juicy hops and a soft feel but with some tradtional hop flavors (grapefruit in this case) and solid bitterness. This hits both those marks (as does Green) which really makes this so enjoyable. Only knock is that once it warms up the hop flavor dies down a little and sweet bready/doughy malt really comes out.
11/13/2016 Notes: Seems like the grapefruit aspect has been abandoned with this beer, with a heavier emphasis on sweet citrusy flavors. A little heavy on the sweetness, but still an excellent dipa. 1,119 charactersCTbrew32, Jan 27, 2016

I get orange, tangerine, tropical fruit, and peach with very little bitterness or malt. There is a slightly dank pine flavor but its not overpowering. The mouth feel is light and clean yet soft and fluffy. I was expecting this one to be a little bigger than the other Tree House IPAs and it really doesn't stand out in that way, but its very enjoyable and well worth the cost of trading. 438 charactersdanh53, Jan 27, 2016

Taste: Pretty juicy ipa. Lots of Citrus (orange)
Mouthfeel: Thought it would be a little smoother and have more of a body to it. Really it just feels like any other great DIPA.
Overall: a lot of hype around this one, and dont get me wrong it is a great DIPA, but there a lot of other more accesible DIPA that are on par, just maybe a little less hazy looking 469 charactersAB_Inbev, Jan 19, 2016

4.55/5  rDev 0%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5A- Pours just like the rest of the Tree House IPA's, hazy as hell and bright to boot. This time, the color is a bright, light orange to almost peach or apricot in color. A smaller head forms and retains for a bit, but only laces a little bit. Overall impression in the glass is that it looks a lot like a mimosa at a Sunday brunch.
S- The first hit on the nose is a punch of fruity and citrus hops that turns slowly toward a mild bitterness in the back half of the smell. This is really a unique smelling beer for a double IPA because it has almost no malt in the scent and also doesn't have an overpowering hop bitterness. Peach, tangerine, apricot, and light orange mix in with light bitterness to provide a very enticing overall scent.
T- When this beer hits the tongue, it follows somewhat of an inverted flavor arc as the scent. A mild to moderate hop bite greets the tongue first before the flavor turns more toward the citrus in the scent. The middle portion of the drink is very citrus forward, with many of the same flavors as the smell had. Right at the end of the drink the hops bitterness returns and lingers with a light, but still citrus forward, bitterness.
M- Man, if no one told me, I might have guessed this is an APA from just the weight of the beer. It isn't light on the tongue, but it also isn't thick and heavy. The carbonation is moderate to slightly elevated, and combined with the weight of the beer, this drinks very easily. No alcohol is detectable in either taste or feel of the beer.
Overall, this is a very unique beer in the style category. Usually I expect at least a little bit of malt in a DIPA, but this one is all fruity and citrus light hop bitterness. I really enjoy this beer. 1,720 charactersboilermakerbrew, Jan 17, 2016

Taste is just like the smell, very fruity, apples, peaches, pineapple and mangos are all there, balanced by a biscuity, malt backbone and just a touch of grassy earthiness. Texture is light but very creamy with medium carbonation, very juicy.
Overall in terms of taste, texture, look and smell this beer delivers the quality you expect from Treehouse beers, i would drink this all the time if i could. 709 charactersSteveB24, Jan 03, 2016

4.58/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Received this as part of a trade from BA MVB1121. Making a point to review it after having it last time and loving it so much that I didn't want to take the time to write down my notes. Poured out of a tallboy that was canned on 11/24/15 and enjoyed just shy of a month on 11/24/15. Poured into a pub-style pint glass.
Appearance (4.5) - Pours a radiant peachy-orange hue with an almost pinkish glow like you might see in some sunsets. The glow is a bi-product of all the particulate in suspension, creating a roiling cloud of hop matter that is dense up near the top of the glass and wafts down in a thick, lazy wisp at the bottom of the glass. Atop the liquid sits three fingers of off-white foam that leaves huge sticky patches on the sides of the glass as it dissipates. 
Smell (4.75) - There is a fair amount of fruit going on here--nectarine, peach, orange zest, but the thing that really draws me in is an herbal, stinks-so-good pungency that rises up out of the glass. I could sit here and smell it for quite awhile before ever needing to take a swig.
Taste (4.5) - A let down comparative to the smell, but still a wonderfully juicy brew with predominant presence of orange and peach and an herbal spiciness that again has that same dankness from the aroma influencing the taste. There is none of the heightened bitterness and sweet booziness that will sometimes turn me off of the imperial variety of IPAs, but at a modest 8.2% abv, there isn't a ton of alcohol to compete with the huge hop profile. Some floral nectar undertones are there as it warms up a little bit, giving some nice depth to the fruity dominance.
Mouthfeel (4.5) - Medium-full bodied with moderate carbonation and a juicy, full mouthfeel from the intense quantities of hop particulate in the liquid. Finish is semi-sweet with just a touch of lingering bitterness.
Overall (4.5), yet another stellar entry from Tree House. The first IPA I've had from them that is a double, and while I personally tend to prefer single IPAs due to the fact that they have relatively less booze and are more drinkable, this is one of the most drinkable double IPAs I've had the pleasure of drinking. I could drink just this and Julius and have all my IPA needs filled for a long time. 2,249 charactersLambicPentameter, Dec 29, 2015

Smell is that of peaches (!), mango,  pine, and dank hops.  Taste follows the nose, nice balance of hops and pine, and the most peach I have ever tasted in a beer.  I was so caught off guard it took me a couple sips to figure out what I was tasting.  Mouthfeel is that of a juicy, pretty thick for an IPA body, with a medium amount of carbonation.  Overall this is an excellent DIPA, that incorporates flavors not commonly used in that style. 536 charactersPourharddrinkslow, Dec 28, 2015

Look: frothy head and orange hazy goodness.
Smell: Dank! Upfront I got tons of weed. After it settles, the tropical smell is more apparent.
Taste: Tons of Mangoes and some peaches. Finishes with the right amount of sweetness.
Feel: Perfect carbonation, and small bite of bitterness at the end. I think Tree house got this down to a science.
Overall: Hard to believe it is a DIPA. Very easy drinking and delicious. Thanks @sims55bfb. 448 charactersKMachHops, Dec 15, 2015

Hazy, light amber color with a persistent, creamy, white head. Aroma bursts with orange citrus fruit, peach, white wine, and light pine. Sweet caramel malts provide a solid base for the citrus hops to shine. There's a slight spice in the finish, which is bitter and long-lasting. An assertive beer with tons of flavor, but there is restraint and balance. It's so smooth and clean that not much effort is needed to finish the entire pint. Tree House certainly has their hoppy beers dialed in. Thanks, Ian! 550 charactersJacobob10, Dec 07, 2015

A: The beer is a cloudy light gold color, with a short off-white head that fades quickly and leaves a spotty lace on the glass.
S: The aroma is an excellent blend of strong fruity citrus, floral hops, and caramelized malts.
T: The taste starts out with a strong floral hops bitterness that is quickly followed by a strong fruity citrus sweetness. The malt character is hearty but not too heavy and brings a good balance. The after-taste is hoppy and sweet.
M: Smooth and very crisp, medium body, medium carbonation, finish is slightly sticky.
O: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not too filling, good kick, very good representation of style, this is a very good 2IPA to drink for a long time. 809 charactersTheManiacalOne, Dec 06, 2015

F - Creamy. Doesn't feel like a Double IPA as there is no syrupy feeling and no biting resin.

T: Taste is amazing.  Fruit flavors once again come through, which are very sweet.  Mango, tangerine, and as labeled, peach are predominant flavors.  Definately some bitterness but its not piney and sharp like some IPAs, its tamed by the sweet character of the beer.  Complex yet so damn enjoyable.
F: Creamy and rich.  The body is heavy, yet because it tastes good it goes back nice and easy.  Carbonation is somewhat on the light side.  The head is pillowy and the body is silky smooth.
O: I'm not even a wild IPA fan but it doesn't take one to see this is a special beer.  It is slightly more bitter than its brother the Julius but its similar in taste and smell.  Top notch 1,062 charactersedward_boumil, Dec 01, 2015

A- Tallboy to a tall, narrow chalice with an extremely hop hazed medium yellow body and a head rising past two fingers. The crown's texture is thick and creamy and it eventually falls to a pillow in the middle and large ring; good retention.
S- Bright and all hops in the forefront with juiciness in the form of both citrus and tropical/stone fruits. Things that come to mind are: tangerines, oranges, grapefruit, pineapple, cantaloupe, mango, tropical bubble gum and floral dank tones. Strength-wise somewhere in the middle of what I expect from Tree House, doesn't burst out quite as much as others.
T- What strength/saturation was missing the smell is instantly found here as it explodes onto the palate like a mixed nectar of citrus and tropical fruit juices. Reiteration of things found in the nose but in a somewhat altered order melon, peach and mango up front followed by tangerine, orange, pineapple, grapefruit, dank herbs and floral notes. Hints of sweetness and cracker grains while the microbes are kept silent.
MF- Medium-heavy overall body with a texture right down the line between frothy and creamy. The bubbles come down at a moderately high level promoting some seriously zesty and juicy flavors. Clean bitter finish.
A very smooth and easy drinking 8%+ IPA. Plenty of juicy flavors with an emphasis on both citrus and tropical tones. Another supercharged, pungent hop nectar effort out of Monson. 1,490 characterscbutova, Nov 29, 2015

Smell: Super juicy. Orange, nectarine, peach, and some grapefruit. It's super tropical with a nice citrus edge. Orange and grapefruit in abundance under the big tropical push. A slight push of dank earth coupled with a soft spiciness. Malts are relatively light with just a touch of caramelized sweetness. Some biscuit dough and a touch of pale malt. Some weed and a solid dirty pine in the back. Peach flesh, grapefruit rind, and a touch of mint leaf. Slightly woody.
Taste: Follows the nose to a T. Super juicy and tropical with a bunch of orange and grapefruit. Successive sips add a touch of dirty pine and a mild woodiness. Solid hop spiciness coupled with peach, nectarine, and mango. A touch of fresh mint leaf. Malts are relatively light with some pale malt sweetness, a touch of biscuit dough, and a touch of caramelized sweetness. More mango creeps out as it warms. Loaded with orange juice and flesh. A touch of grapefruit and orange zest. Juiciness drops a touch as it warms. Dank and spicy with a soft floral edge. Moderately bitter. Some hop oil.
Mouthfeel: Creamy medium body with a moderate carbonation. Slightly dry on the finish with a slick initial sip and follow through. Smooth.
Overall: Tropical weed juice.
This is juicy weed in a tropical fruit bowl. A bit messy overall, but everyone should drink this as often as possible. 1,514 charactersGoblinmunkey7, Nov 28, 2015

A: Hazy, as advertised - cloudy and hazy, perhaps a little cleaner than Tree House Green - tangerine-gold color, pours with a medium sized, white head - fades to a wispy cap and leaves a really nice web of lacing
S: Bright, hoppy, and juicy - loads of citrus with some bright, ripe, fresh orange juice and flesh - fleshy grapefruit and some citrus zest - ripe peach flesh and juice - tropical fruit juice, with some pineapple, mango, and passion fruit aromas - lightly spicy, floral citrus, citrusy spice, leafy hops - some pine, some mint - this is a juice bomb, but there is some balance from some doughy, lightly sweet malts - a light touch of caramel, too
T: Possibly mistaken for fruit juice - so, so fruity and juicy - waves of citrus juice - orange juice, orange flesh - grapefruit juice - citrus zest, with some spicy and floral citrus as well - peach juice - pineapple, mango, and passionfruit - some leafy and herbal notes - touch of pine - medium level of bitterness - lingering oil - malts are fairly light but provide some balance, light sweetness, doughy bread, touch of caramel - alcohol is extremely well-hidden
M: Medium body, very smooth, creamy, nicely carbonated, somewhat dry finish
O: Hazed and amazed
I have nothing but praise for Haze. It's wildly hoppy without actually going over the top. I suppose it could be a bit cleaner overall, but here, the chaos really works. I genuinely like this more than Green. Once again, I find myself impressed.
Update (multiple re-tastings) - I pretty much up my score every time I have this. I adore it. 1,588 charactersangrybabboon, Nov 26, 2015

Poured from a can into a glass… Appearance was cloudy and orange in color. Aroma was intense citrus/orange, juicy and delicious.
The taste was vivid orange and other citrus fruit. Bitterness was well balanced with the perceived sweetness from the beer. Medium body. The 8% ABV is basically undetectable. 
I was blown away by this beer…  Just amazing. 403 charactersinvertalon, Nov 25, 2015

4.49/5  rDev -1.3%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5This beer is yet another slam dunk from Tree House. Massive citrus aromatics: orange, grapefruit, some pineapple, and ripe peach. Hop bitterness is a little more dank and pronounced than some of their other beers, it definitely drinks a little "bigger" than beers like Julius and Green. Malts have a caramel quality to them which increases the richness.
Mouthfeel has the TH signature creaminess. Appearance is hazy and beautiful, laces well but not quite as nicely as their regular IPAs. In terms of the alcohol bite it is very slightly perceptible. I don't understand what goes on at that brewery or how they figured this out, but they seem to be incapable of making anything less than excellent beer. 704 charactersdd43, Nov 08, 2015

Appearance: incredibly hazy and vibrant orange color. Head is fluffy, long-lasting and off white, leaving big puffs of foam on top and a nice ring of lace around the edges.
Aroma: piles of citrus overwhelm the nostrils, along with a touch of zestiness. The whole room reeks of hops after cracking the can with this one.
Taste: a TON of citrus and pineapple, mixed in with a solid amount of earthiness. Zesty and bitter on the finish, with a lingering dankness.
Feel: medium bodied, with a relatively dry finish for the hop profile.
Overall: excellent IIPA, another big-time hit for TH. 632 charactersTheElectricOne, Nov 05, 2015

4.98/5  rDev +9.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5Look - Straight orange juice! The typical TH haze. Their beers are absolutely amazing looking in the glass. 
Smell - Pineapple, orange juice, mangos, citrusy, pulpy, some dankness 
Taste - Follows the nose. Tons of pineapple, tons of tropical fruits, orange, citrus, grapefruit, pithy,  insanely drinkable/crushable for 8.2%. 
Feel - Signature TH. Creamy, velvety, smooth, slight alcohol burn on the back end
Overall - This is one of the best DIPAs on the planet.....period! Tree House continues to impress. They are one of the best.....if not thee best brewery out there. 573 charactersTonyjenlasc, Nov 02, 2015

Huge citrusy orange nose. Taste follows with sweet orange and tropical fruit, delicious. The hops on this one don't hit until very late in the sip, strong but not unpleasant grapefruit peel and touch of pine. The hops become bitter well after the swallow.  Semi dry finish and soft medium mouthfeel.  Another outstanding IPA by Tree House, late hops linger a bit long but way good. 493 charactersNolaHopHead, Oct 21, 2015

4.68/5  rDev +2.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Thanks to jakehoodlum for this 16 oz. silver can, in that seemingly east coast minimalist slap-a-label on a can blank style. Drunking by myself in a hotel room, working, watching the Twins, wild-card bound!
The pour is golden yellow with a solid white cap & active bubbles that are visible even through the (h)aze. Nose clocks in at strong oranges & more nebulous fruit tones with a sweet smile. Not bad. 
Haze is what I’d be in if I had a four-pack of this. White Bronco hit & run of bitterness right on kick-off, with no time for any of the knicker-twisting fruits that too many IPAs are veering towards. Underneath the sneering is classic citrus, light mango & apricot, other tropicals, & just a pinch of white pepper. The finish goes slightly grainy with downslope pine, but the bitterness is what really kicks the ending. I could drink a lot of this; matter of fact, I already have. Why does my glass look so empty? Who’s stealing my beer?
Unlike some of its east coast compatriots, this is an IPA & not a pale ale with a Chevy lift kit bolted on. Bitter blast, tasty fruitiness, & a ridiculous drinkability that’s just this side of a beer bong. I only have one more of these? I will be cradling it lovingly when I return home. This is an excellent beer that’s only  one thin mint away from joining the elite. EDIT: after not wanting to brush my teeth last night & thinking about this beer several times today, I can't figure why I didn't give this a "5" on taste. A world-class IIPA. 1,500 charactersmaximum12, Sep 23, 2015

Big orange and mango on the nose. Cracking open the can fills the room, instant mouth watering reflex initiated! Starts on the flavor sweet, then right into the tropical fruit, more mango and peach here, a touch of sweet orange. Finishes dank and leafy with a residual hop flavor after the swallow. 
8.2% ABV? Yeah right, drinks like 6%. Fluffy mouthfeel. Another grand slam from Tree House. 576 charactersBranfordBound, Sep 22, 2015

Look: As the name suggests, a hazy golden/orange color. Nice head retention.
Smell: Mostly pine and fruitiness.
Taste: Really tasty. Lots of tropical fruit. Not too bitter...which is kind of nice (actually shared this with my non-beer drinking sister and she very much enjoyed it)
Feel: Medium body. Slightly creamy. 
Overall: A really good IIPA. Glad I was able to try it. Will seek out more Tree House brews in the future. 487 characterssittinggc, Sep 07, 2015

4.1/5  rDev -9.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Got this one in a nice IP trade.  Hope it's good!  16 oz. can into a tulip.
A - Hazier than usual , and not quite as bright orange as the others I've had, but the head is beautiful.  Tight off-white bubbles that are going absolutely nowhere.
N - Hmm, definitely plenty hoppy, but not bitter at all.  I get some bright citrus and not a whole lot else.  I would prefer a bit stronger, but this is exactly how I like my IPAs to smell.
T - Ooooo, very nice.  Really not at all bitter.  I do get more pine here than I did in the nose, but otherwise plenty of citrus.  Not amazingly complex, but a solid all-around IPA.
M - Here's where Tree House really shines.  Somehow all of these IPAs turn to froth as soon as they hit my tongue, and it's just wonderful.  I don't know how they do it.  They just know how to craft a good beer.  Very wet on the finish, actually, like it's continuously quenching my thirst.  Nicely done.
O - Another winner. 943 charactersCraftFan5, Sep 03, 2015

4.75/5  rDev +4.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.75Poured from a can three weeks old into a pint glass
Appearance: Nice finger of head and great carbonation. Blonde, yellow, hazy color. About what you expect from a TH hoppy beer.
Aroma: Tons of tropical fruit (pineapple, mango, lime, lemon, orange) also a slight hint of onion. Overall smells like pineapple/mango juice.
Taste: Follows the noise with tropical fruit flavor (pineapple, mango, and orange). There is also a gum ball like sweetness to the beer which I find very interesting. The finish comes in with bitterness (more than most TH beers) and more sweetness.
Feel: Creamy, biscuitty mouthfeel. Could be slightly fully for my taste but not thin in the any sense.
Overall an amazing DIPA which I could have over heady or SOS. Some enjoy Julius and Green more than this one, but to me they are all slightly different and amazing beers. 843 charactersMyThoughtsExactly, Aug 26, 2015

T: Apricot, pine, earthiness, tangerine, light crystal malt sweetness, finishing with a mild bitterness. 
M: Medium-light body and light, soft carbonation.  Alcohol is completely hidden.
O: Endlessly drinkable, very nice flavor which isn’t too fruity or piney, but dry and uncommonly well balanced. 525 characterspmarlowe, Aug 26, 2015

16 ounce can poured into a True Blood pint glass. 
Bite me!
Not as hazy as I thought it would be. Half inch head is not going anywhere.
Nice tropical aroma.
Taste follows suit.
Nice mouthfeel.
Overall: Glad I finally got to try this one. This is one of the very few DIPA's where the finish doesn't ruin it for me like so, so many other Heady wannabes. Big thanks to Tim Fitzgerald! Nice job Tree House! 416 charactersbobv, Aug 23, 2015

Balanced so nicely for a double.  Finishes dry and leaves some hop flavor behind.  Frothy, soft mouthfeel.  Overall a really excellent double IPA that can hold its own with just about anything.  Tree House has a real excellent treat in Haze. 477 charactersanteatr23, Aug 18, 2015

4.58/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Poured from the can into a Spiegelau IPA glass.  One week after canning sale at Tree House brewery.
Pale apricot orange body color, and slightly cloudy.  Lemon edges towards the bottom.  Head is a solid growing four fingers.  Simple white and very fine bubbles in the head formation.  Sits like an even puck, island clumping in the middle with excellent pill and ring like lacing, staying power, and retention.
Wonderful mix of dank and earth notes of hop on the nose.  Heavily woody, with hints of burnt pine and great smokey dank quality on the hop.  Mouth watering quality.
Palate really makes a great impression.  Instead of a dank slam of weeds, a big juiced body comes in large and full.  Mild sensing tangerine orange, even tropical guava fruit in the mid palate.  Finishes thick and almost velvet like with a great pine bitterness of earth on the aftertaste.  Big and in control, well contrasted between fruit and earth qualities.  Perfect amount of sweetness in the malt coming through with just a wonderful balance between sweet and bitter, and hop earth and fruit.
Fantastic well made DIPS that actually comes off more like a great balanced IPA. 1,160 characterssmakawhat, Aug 15, 2015

Thanks to marino13412 for the awesome trade.
This reminds me of a buffer sibling to TG's Pseudo Sue due to the juicy peaches and mangos. Super dank, but it's surprisingly got a clean finish. Very interesting. 283 charactersRollzroyce21, Aug 12, 2015

Pours a hazed golden light orange with a creamy dense and bubbly off white head leaving behind thick sheets of lace.  Nose of citrus, bready malt and spice; orange, grapefruit rind, cracker, pepper, grass. Creamy smooth body, thick and full, with dry mildly bitter finish.  Flavor is dominated by pine and citrus rind, smooth bitterness and a strong bready malt base with a light grassy pepper spiciness.  A solid, "easy drinking" pine and citrus IIPA though not a standout from Tree House or others. 531 charactersyourefragile, Aug 09, 2015

4.96/5  rDev +9%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5Look - Poured into Teku glass from 750ml. Golden Haze with a nice head and lacing.
Smell - Citrus, pine, and tropical fruit. Getting a slight grainy/malt aroma on the end.
Taste - Unique. Tropical and citrus fruit with a bit of pine.
Feel - Smooth with very little carbonation. Very easy drinker for 8.2%.
Overall - Not the best example of a Tree House beer and definitely not my favorite. Still this is very good and crushable. Will update my review after tasted from the 16 oz cans for comparison. 
*Tasted out of the can and it was better, not sure why but it seemed to be more balanced than the 750ml. 610 charactersMatthewHopHead, Aug 08, 2015

Aroma of gentle pine, sweet pineapple, orange rind and hint of peppery spice.
Taste of tropical fruits, orange and citrus.   pine hops 
Low carbonation, smooth as silk, mild pine hop bitter aftertaste . Well balanced.

Pours the color of orange pulp with an enormous frothy white head.  Lacing is abundant.  Smell is a blast of orange rind, sweet pineapple, grapefruit with a slight piney note as well.  Taste is a bit bitter up front but the citrus notes take over quickly, some breadiness from pilsner malt(?) peeks in there and then fades into a slightly bitter finish.  Feel is medium with no signs of the 8.2ABV at all.  Another deliciously beautiful beer from Tree House.  Can they do anything wrong? 559 charactersJamesStreet, Jul 31, 2015

Honestly I just haven't had a bad beer yet from these guys, but Haze is such. Well balanced DIPA.  Very citrusy, fruit bomb full of flavor and smooth as hell, with a little bit of bitterness on the back end.  But that's ok and too be expected from the style.  I don't enjoy DIPAs that are too malt forward or too bitter, but this is neither.  Just a great example of this style and a beer that I will come back to at every opportunity that I get. 540 charactersNYC-IPAnAPA, Jul 29, 2015

S: Quite fruity/citrusy. I get lots of orange/pineapple smell, with some more hop/piney at the end
T: Kind of a mix between green and julius, but not the same level as either. It has some fruityness and then some dank/piney hops but neither reach the level as the other two beers. But still a top Ipa haha
F: Little better then green and on the same level as julius where its a little thicker but still leaves a little stickyness feeling on the tongue.
O: Another amazing one from treehouse slightly behind julius and green but still one of the best ipas. 672 charactersGinjaSlice, Jul 26, 2015

Smells citrusy with light notes of pine.  Tons of straight-up orange with a little bit of mango in there.  Very nice, but nothing super exceptional.
Tastes like it smells: light pine hops up front, moving into a middle that's dominated by tropical fruit nodes, and then ending with some bready malt and more pine.  The balance is pretty good and the smoothness is exceptional for a beer of this strength.  
I don't know if this quite counts as one of the best beers I've ever had. Or--actually, I do, and it isn't.  But just because it didn't *quite* live up to the hype doesn't mean it's not excellent. 657 charactersmynie, Jul 25, 2015

The color is slightly hazy orange with two fingers of thick white head and some nice lacing left on the glass.
The smell is fruity with some touches of grapefruit and a really nice pine aroma. There is a spruce or Douglas fur aroma here that is slightly Christmas like for the pine needle aroma. There is a slight bready aroma that is a little dry and sweet.
The taste is fruity with some touches of orange, lemon, and peach coming out at first in a welcoming spark to a wonderful flavor voyage. There is a slightly biscuit flavor toward the back that pushes out just a little until the end. The last traces of this beer finishes at a bitter but fruity exclamation point and then gently leads into a loose aftertaste that has haunts of the same fruit flavor there with a slight pine flavor at the edges.
The feel of this beer is smooth for a double IPA and really behaves more like low ABV pale ale for the most part. There is a bit of a kick that does come when really getting into this beer and not letting it breathe. The higher levels of this beer can be felt even if it’s rushed. 1,182 charactersDuhast500, Jun 29, 2015

A: Pours a deeply hazed orange color. Bubbly white head settles to a half inch cap. Wispy lacing.
S: Orange and peach. Fruit cocktail. Hints of passion fruit and sweet bud. Whiff of soft pine. Toasty and bready undertones. 
T: Orange, grapefruit, passion fruit. Earthy hop notes of soft pine, bark, and sweet cannabis too. Oily. Bitterness is firm and even throughout. Faint bready and toasty malt contribution, maybe caramel too. Quick flash of bubblegum. Trailing finish or orange wedges and sweet bud. 
M: Medium-thick body. Soft and creamy texture. Gently prickling carbonation. Hop astringencies grip a bit, but are relatively tame. 
O: Well whaddaya know, another awesome IPA/DIPA from Tree House. The hits keep coming. Dank, fruity, citrusy. Loads of hop flavor without a lot of bite. Creamy smooth body. It's every hop head beer geek's wet dream. 891 charactersryan1788a5, Jun 25, 2015

Heavy notes of orange, grapefruit, mango and papaya are followed by a sticky, bitter wave that combines to create an incredibly tasty double IPA. Just the slightest hint of alcohol adds a little heat to the proceedings. As is Tree House's trademark, the beer leaves you with a creamy and crisp impression. Big flavors, soft body.

Pours a golden orange body with a frothy white head that reduces slowly to leave decent retention and spotty lacing. 
Aromas are inviting and fresh - grapefruit, tropical fruit, creamy malt, floral notes, citrus. 
On the tongue is raw, fresh tropical hops, citrus, orange-creamsicle, bursting citrus, followed by a slightly resinous, fresh floral aftertaste. Very nice mouthfeel, medium body, creamy, raw feel, very tropical. 
Overall one of the best DIPAs I've ever had, period. 560 charactersgcamparone, Jun 24, 2015

The first sip gives way to mango, tropical fruit punch, floral hints, along with orange marmalade and grapefruit. Honey and cracker malt backs the mild bitterness. Mouthfeel is soft and velvety, with a slight lingering bitterness that finishes dry and grassy. I didn’t have to think very hard to realize this beer reminds me very much of SoS.

4.84/5  rDev +6.4%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Pours a hazy orange color, not unlike every other TH IPA. This is not a knock.
The aroma is...orgasmic. I can't think of any other word for it. It's so citrusy but has a hint of pine and honey that really balances it out. Orange and grapefruit dominate the nose, but I detect hints of mango, as well as something sweeter (berry?). Either way, this is one of the best smelling beers I've ever experienced. It's not "in your face" like Heady Topper, but the subtlety is brilliant. I simply adore the aroma this beer possesses. 
The taste is very tropical. Orange, dragonfruit, grapefruit. The piney bitterness is present, but not pronounced. Some grassy undertones form the basis of a truly remarkable DIPA. 
The mouth is unbelievable. This is a DIPA yet it drinks like a pale ale. It is so smooth and, dare I say, light, that you will easily forget you are drinking a beer with an 8.20 ABV. 
While this isn't quite as balanced as Julius, it might just be the best beer Tree House has to offer. 996 charactersScaryEd, Jun 05, 2015

A citrusy hop bomb that's so smooth you can't really tell that it's an Imperial IPA. It has a lot of similarities to Julius, but it's not quite as balanced. A real treat to drink and certainly better than the vast majority of IPAs you will find on your local retailer's shelves. If Monson, MA is within driving distance, make the trek. Otherwise, add it to your ISO trading list. Delicious. 457 charactersTheIPAHunter, Jun 02, 2015
4.75/5  rDev +4.4%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75L - a bright, clementine juice. No gradient. Solid floury hue throughout that looks gorgeous in the light. 
S - has a slightly tart sour stringent aroma. Has a certain aroma I can't quite pinpoint! Spicy grapefruit rind? Maybe! Kiwi, guava, peach. 
T - peach punch. The best part about this beer is the upfront peachy juicy blast that assails the tastebuds and blows flavor out the nose. Pungent grapefruit tang in the middle. Light, unripe mango with a mild acidity. Dies down as quickly as it came, and settles into a candied peach sweetness helped along by the booze.
F - soft and buoyant. Slight syrup due to the booze. Refreshing relief from the fruity acidic fruitiness. 
O - a great beer that it pains me to admit is sometimes not the best! Depends, batch to batch. Sometimes it's unbelievably pungent and juicy, and other times it just tastes sticky and flavorless. But when it's good, it's good. Hot damn. I should note that in the past year or so (2016), this beer has improved tremendously in both flavor and consistency. I'd like to rescind that previous comment! 1,079 charactersagreenman19, Jun 02, 2015

S: Orange blossom and grapefruit, passionfruit. Some grassiness and honey.
M: Smooth, medium feel, almost silky. Approaches a full very well-rounded body but has a tart snap at end. Slightest booziness.
S: Ends with peach and other stone fruit; pineapple/orange slush. Pine throughout, underripened tropical fruit--papaya and guava. Earthiness of lychee fruit. Grapefruit bitters. Dank juiciness. 512 charactersorcrist_cleaver, May 24, 2015

4.37/5  rDev -4%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5A - Pours a hazy, cloudy medium to dark tan orange color, thin lacing ring, light carbonation.
S - A touch of tea leaves along with a lot of tropical fruit aroma: mango, papaya, and orange.
T - Tropical frutiness from start to finish that follows the nose minus the tea leaves - mangos, papaya, orange, lemon, grapefruit with a medium bittersweet finish.
M - Medium body and with all the hops your mouth gets a healthy coating and creates a somewhat cotton-like feel after awhile and the 8%+ is completely hidden in the beginning but surfaces "just a tad" as the beer warms.
O - This is a fine Double IPA worth trying, not a "100" rating IMO but really darn good. 667 charactersjzeilinger, May 16, 2015

S:  There's a lot going on here, very complex. Smells incredibly tropical - mango, melon, tangerine, pineapple, papaya, banana.
T:  Bursting with citrus and a nice piney/hoppy finish. Has more of an earthy, crispness to it. Slight bitterness. Hint of orange aftertaste. 
M:  Medium carbonation, hops prickly to the tongue, goes down smooth, very refreshing.
O:  I like this, a lot! Reminds me of a more hoppy version of GREEN. I was lucky enough to pick up a can of this, fresh via a trade. The freshness contributes to the complexity of flavors/aroma. This is big boy beer right here!!!! 657 charactersCoffeePorter, May 13, 2015

A - Hazy apricot body.  Almost hefeweizen like.  Cream white head pours a finger high with nice retention and fantastic lace.
S - Really nice nose.  Citrusy with orange, papaya and grapefruit.  Banana, cilantro, alspice, and green pineapple backend.
T - Interesting flavor profile.  Really fresh and really green, with a semi-sweet resiny finish.  Fresh cut grass, sweet squash, bread crust, fresh green papaya, and honey.  Great integration.
M - Smooth medium body.  Murky finish.
O - Relatively unique flavor profile for the style, with lots of bright, pleasantly green (under-ripe) fruit flavors. 655 charactersvfgccp, May 13, 2015

Look: as the name implies, a hazy, deep golden orange. a crisp but sticky half finger head  with a decent lacing.  
Smell: peach, apricot and orange, maybe a touch of mango or some other tropical fruit. 
Taste:  peach and mango notes at first followed with a well-balanced bitterness. a hint of orange on the finish. very fresh, clean taste almost like fresh air. I also get an earthy almost woody note towards the end. 
Feel: crisp on the tongue with tight carbonation, but not overwhelming. just right. light and drinkable. finishes a bit dry. 
Overall, im very impressed with my 2nd offering from Tree House. I was blown away by their Curiosity 14 as well. from the very little i've tried from these guys they seem to have it together very well. complex and well balanced beers to say the least. Every sip seems to bring out new flavors. we will definitely be going back to fill our growlers soon! 1,001 charactersSvenson89, Apr 19, 2015

This beer was good, but with Vermont's Big Three readily available for me on a fairly consistent basis, it fell short of my expectations.
Still, in the absence of some of the other big DIPA's, this one would certainly deliver on flavor and feel. 468 charactersrodmanfor3, Apr 19, 2015

Appearance:  A one finger head was poured that reduced to a thin layer.  It is a hazy golden yellow orange color with no vision of anything.  Frothy lacing down the glass as the beer was drank.
Smell:  Juicy hops, tropical, citrus, grassy, earthy, spicy, and danky hops followed by biscuity, toasted, and pale malts. 
Taste:  Got to love those juicy hops.  Nice malt backbone and light tingly bitterness.  I keep going back for more.  Tasty and delicious.
Mouthfeel:  Smooth, medium bodied, refreshing, tasty, medium carbonation, and slight bitterness in the rear.
Overall:  Another awesome beer from these settled guys.  Good  to see the new Brewery and let's hops the production of all their brews increases soon too.  This growler isn't going to last long. 804 charactersFlounder57, Mar 13, 2015

A--Nice white head sits on top of a hazy orange, nice lacing
S--Unreal.  Orange explosion, tangerine, pineapple, every tropical fruit you can imagine.  Caramel sweetness?  Maybe, its hard to smell anything besides that powerful fruit
T--Absolutely follows the nose as expected.  Fruit explosion, almost overwhelms your mouth (in a good way) and then switches to a hop bite but smooth all the way.  Malt is there just enough to make this 8.2 beer dangerously smooth and drinkability is high
M--Medium and smooth, didn't dry me out very much
O--Never have I had such a flavorful tropical DIPA.  It was sweet but not boozy, with the right mixture of hops and malt (like 90 hops/10 malt ratio) which is just where I like it in a DIPA.  Looking forward to more Tree House beers--incredible! 827 charactersTbub18, Jan 09, 2015

First THB glass pours with a 1/4" white head, over the cloudy burnished gold brew. Head deflates slowly, with leggy lasting lace. Aroma is piney hoppiness. 
Taste starts sweet, mouth-puckering citrus in the middle, then pine and bitter take over through the close. Mouthfeel is soft and smooth, and drinkability is dangerously easy.   Wow, great representative of the style. 427 charactersppoitras, Dec 07, 2014

Poured from the 750ml bottle into a Tree House tulip pint.
a: Hazy orange with a finger thick white head which receded to even surface foam and dense lacing.
s: Strong pine resin and grapefruit.
t: Follows the nose, and the accompanying hop bite is considerable.  Yet little bitterness on the tongue, although what seems to be alcohol throat burn is noticeable at first.
m: Medium to full, plenty of carbonation tingle.  
o: A powerful and flavorful DIPA with lots of danky hop goodness.  Dangerously drinkable.
UPDATE 6/20/15: Out in pint cans now, bought six at the brewery today.  Raising my ratings for appearance and mouthfeel from 4.25 to 4.5. 700 charactersscotorum, Nov 10, 2014

Tangerine and peaches on the nose, this is one great smelling DIPA! Slightly bitter citrusy up front with a touch of dank. Finishes dry. Medium body with light carbonation.

4.91/5  rDev +7.9%The beer comes in an opaque rich rich golden orange. Absolutely beautiful.
The aroma offers sweet orange candy, tangerine, papaya, juicy fruit, hints of green grass and pine.
The flavor follows with that juicy fruit bubble flavor upfront, along with tropical fruit, nectarine, guava. Then there's a touch of sweetness as the beer transitions onto orange candy and tangerine. On the back, a slight grassiness balance with orange zest.
An absolute knockout from Tree House. 474 charactersdar482, Oct 14, 2014

A:Murky deep orange with some amber as well.
S: Blast of fruit, juice, tropical smells, ripen mango and pluots.
T: Reminds me of a heavier version of Julius. Not as perfect as Julius but damn close. Like a glass of Orange/Mango juice. Sweet, great hoppiness. Bitter in the best way it can be.
F: Chewy, juicy, creamy..leaves the mouth watering.
O: This is what DIPAs should aspire to be. The crew at Tree House is awesome and are making the best IPAs on the planet right now. 565 charactersHop_God, Oct 13, 2014

4.5/5  rDev -1.1%Picked up a couple of bottles of Haze from brewer Dean at Tree House. Sent one out to my fellow members of the Chicago Beer Snobs in Chicago, and shared the other with my brother yesterday. This is not only a great brew, but one that is extremely drinkable. Don't know if we are correct, but we tasted a little bit of peach maybe. The alcohol does not present itself, stays well hidden.     I know Dean hangs with our Vermont brewers at Lawson's and Hill Farmstead, and I can say from the quality of this brew he well deserves to hang with those guys. Great brew, hard to come by; but if you are in Central Mass area seek it out. Congrats Dean.... 647 charactersricknelson, Oct 12, 2014

4.6/5  rDev +1.1%750ml swing-top, purchased today, into a Tree House Teku.
A: Pours a medium orange with two fingers of foamy white head that fades to a nice lace, beer is slightly hazy but I've seen wayyy cloudier (looking at you Heady...)
S: Sweet tropical fruit just punches you in the nose with tangerine, mango, and orange. Subtle caramel malt sweetness and a touch of grass.
T: Up front tropical fruit, loads of tangerine, mango, orange and grapefruit. Was described by the brewery as "OJ" and while not quite that far, this is a citrus bomb. There is some pine and earthy flavors but the citrus clearly dominates.
M: Medium bodied with nice crisp carbonation and relatively low bitterness. Drinks easily and goes down smooth.
O: This is a great DIPA from Tree House that I'm thankful to get to try. I have another 750 that I'll surely be sharing with friends. 855 charactersMikecap, Sep 06, 2014

5/5  rDev +9.9%Just got and drank batch #6 of Haze. Each batch is a little different - they use different hops.
Haze is fruity and surprisingly smooth for an 8.2% DIPA. If I could pick just one flavor, I'd say it tastes like tangerines. It has the citrus/orange fruit up front, with a little bite like the pith from citrus fruit, and a little tangyness to it. I get very minimal malts. As the beer warms it really opens up - more citrus, some mango, papaya, even peach. Really tasty stuff and nice work from the guys at Tree House! 517 charactersRichKent, Sep 06, 2014

4.25/5  rDev -6.6%750ml swingtop growler into a Founders snifter. 
Pours a .5 finger foamy white head with great retention. Beer is a cloudy mango. Great, thick lace and just a great-looking beer overall. 
Nose is typical northeastern IIPA. Fruity, sweet and aromatic and real appetizing. 
Flavor opens sweet mango, pineapple, starfruit, and citrus. Amazing. Cane sugar sweetness in the middle with just the right amount of citrus hop bitterness to balance things out. Really delicious. 
Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Smooth in the mouth and goes down easy and slightly dry. Finishes dry with a resiny aftertaste. Pulls the flavor together nicely. 
The first beer I've had from Tree House is definitely a winner. A very solid IPA that provides an incredible experience from nose to flavor to feel. I'm looking forward to more from these guys. 841 charactersSpeedwayJim, Aug 20, 2014

A- Hazy (as I had figured) light yellow body, two finger white head with great retention, very nice thick rings of lacing. Altogether a very nice looking DPA. Certainly lives up to the name.
S- Floral, citrus, pine hops hit you in the face along with a nice pale malt caramel sweetness that balances out the hop aromas. A bit simplistic to be sure, but very delicious just the same.
F- Pine, pine, orange, grapefruit, cut by some grassiness and sweet, honeyed bread and cracker flavours. Quite well balanced in terms of flavours, but the hops do stand out.
M- Medium in body, good carbonation with a nice creamy feel that makes it so drinkable. Not particularly bitter on the finish despite all the hop aromas and flavours.
O- Very nice double pale ale that is quite a bit different in character than Julius, definitely worth seeking out. 897 charactersStevedore, Aug 16, 2014

4.18/5  rDev -8.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.2525 oz. growler served in a nonic (thanks Joe). Bottled 7/12/14. Pours a translucent straw gold with a tight, 1/2 inch, bright white head. Head eventually dissipates into a consistent skim. Some lacing present, but poor adherence for the most part. Nose expresses bright citrus notes, a hint of ethanol and something else, perhaps herbal or oniony; it's hard to tease out. Citrus in the flavor profile is just as bright and akin to tangerines or clementines, with a mild hops bittering at the finish to break up the sweetness between quaffs. Mouthfeel is light-medium with an even carbonation and some acidity that lightly stimulates the salivary glands. Texture is slightly oily. Overall, another exceptional beer from Treehouse. I just wish they were closer. 759 charactersJwale73, Jul 25, 2014

S-Not as aromatic as I've come to expect Treehouse's world class brews to be. It's too soft but I do like what's there. Peach and nectarine hops along with grass and citrus. Pale, subtle malt sweetness.
T-Flavor is clearly better. Tropical fruits, some pineapple, peach and apricot hops. Grassy and floral hops as well. Tangerine. Some sweetish hop flavor accompanied by a breadiness. Has a melon flavor from the hops as well.
M-Not overly bitter. No heat. Medium bodied with some hop resin. Medium carbonation. Aftertaste doesn't linger for too long.
O-A very good beer but not my favorite Treehouse brew. Still better than much of what I can consistently get my hands upon. Always a treat to cop some nectar from the brewers in Monson. 851 charactersVelvetExtract, Jul 15, 2014

Aroma- strong pine/ grass aroma, grapefruit, a hint of mango, touch of bready malt
Taste- one of the best beers I have tried this year, very well balanced and the tasting notes follow the aroma pine some grapefruit and hint of mango. The bitternes is there to balance the sweetness in the malt but it does not overpower your palate. 431 charactersKevindrinksbeer, Jul 15, 2014

Decent creamy 1/2 finger head fades med pace, nice sticky lacing, semi hazy orange honey color. Nice legs too. Column of streaming bubbles. 
Nose brings dank resin, nice generic tropical fruits, kiwi hops, some grapefruit pith and little orange rind, nice overall fruity, with mild pine to go with the resin and dankness. Tangerine, Clementine, etc. 
Taste starts with tons of citrus, orange juice, tangerine Clementine, little mango and papaya like, juicy citrus fruit, little rind and pith. Mild pine, very light, and some resin and darkness. Little hop oil, so much juicy citrus, little generic tropical fruit, kiwi hops, etc. Decent but mild malt profile, great balance. Finish is drier, little resin and hop oil, light bitterness but nice citrus and tropical fruits lingering, little rind and pith. 
Mouth is med bod, no booze, maybe a touch thin, decent carb. 
Overall pretty great, not quite Julius or Green, more like somewhere in between, but still very nice. 1,034 charactersjlindros, Jun 22, 2014

Appearance - golden hue. Hazy in recent versions. Thin head.
Smell - hoppy. Orange smell. Tropical smell
Taste - hoppy citrus taste with no booze taste. Very fresh tasting.
Mouthfeel - nice. Again alcohol well hidden. 
Overall - a good, solid double IPA. I find it to be better than, but similar to, DirtWolf, which is a compliment in my mind. 427 characters311bulldog, Jun 21, 2014

A - Poured into a Kate the Great tulip a nice crystal clear light golden hue with a thin one finger head that faded to leave light lacing and a nice foamy halo and wispy.
S - Aromas of big, dank hops big resinous notes, orange peel, grapefruit, light tropical notes. Really assertive wet hops, hardly any malts. 
T - Taste is similar to the nose, though flopped with resinous and citrus. Nice candy orange notes, light grapefruit, wet lightly bitter notes, much less bitter than I thought it would taste. No booze detectable. Nice citrus hop notes, fleshy fruit.
M - Mouthfeel is really nice, lightly carbonated, alcohol hidden well.
O - Overall this beer was pretty good, however, not my favourite double ipa from then. Still good though! 776 charactersrudzud, Jun 21, 2014
