Palate Contaminants: seafood udon
Appearance is a very pleasant medium-dark amber, and it's fairly clear. Fair amount of fine head that leaves some nice lacing.
Smell is peach, red grapefruit, honeydew melon, and marshmallows. (I keep smelling those damn things.) It has a little bit of freshly cut white wood, just not quite pine. Sweetness is moderate, and any bitterness is hardly detectable. 
Wow, the first sip is intense. The fruit flavor is concentrated. It doesn't just show up, going along for the ride; it explodes. Even better, it's apricots. I'm drinking friggin' apricot juice. (Note to self, at 11.5% and 32oz., don't chug.) Concentrated peach and a regular little bit of bitter orange. Bitter bark, too, so maybe it actually is medicine. It's sweet, but not overly so. Bitter flavors are far in the background. It's fair to call it very malty, but it doesn't overwhelm. Like Hop Venom, it's very well balanced. Another thing as it warms up slightly, there's even more depth to the fruit flavor as there's some savoriness.
I can get a slight bit of carbonation with a swish around the mouth, but it's still pretty smooth. It's heavy, but it's well balanced, and the alcohol is very well hidden. Still, I'm sipping. 1,253 charactersZythophile, Mar 25, 2017

pours an almost clear golden color, thin band of white head leaves some nice lacing. 
somewhat mild aromas - pine, dankness, sweet malts, citrus peel, grapefruit, hint of ripe fruits. palate follows nicely, but is somewhat dominated by sweet and syrupy malts and booze. the booze is not astringent or bothersome, but definitely comes through as expected at this abv. caramel and honey malts play nicely with grapefruit, pine, floral qualities, orange, hint of ripe tropical fruits including mango and maybe a touch of pineapple. piney bitterness on the finish is well balanced by the malt sweetness. mouthfeel is medium bodied and syrupy... not on par with the pillowy NE ipas that I adore. overall its remarkably drinkable for the abv, and is not excessively boozy in any way. however the balance tips towards malty sweetness and alcohol over the fruity hops, and having enjoyed more fruit forward triple IPAs such as Sunshine & Peril, this isnt one I would necessarily seek out. still enjoyable and interesting to try! 1,071 charactersHyptochrons, Feb 20, 2017

A: Pours a golden orange color with minimal white head. Very small amounts of thin white lacing throughout.
S: Big fruity/citrusy aromas of pineapple, orange, and guava. Milder notes of dank, piney, and earthy hops.
T: Taste matches aromas well. Super juicy with fruity notes of pineapple, mango, peach, papaya, guava, orange, and tangerine followed by a very slight piney, hoppy bitterness.
F: Light to medium bodied, super smooth, with a small to moderate amount of carbonation.
O: Overall, this is a great TIPA. Super fruity, but not overly sweet. Very drinkable, ABV is almost entirely hidden and for 11.5-12% that is unreal. Would love to try this stuff fresh from the lines. Would definitely seek this out again. 776 charactersBeerGuy8315, Dec 27, 2016
4.74/5  rDev +4.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75This beer is pretty damn difficult to distinguish between it and PTY.  Seriously.  For years now I've been just skipping the big line at the DIPA fest for PTY and just getting Notorious with no line, the beers are almost indistinguishable.  
Has a pretty color that is a mixture of both orange and gold, comes with a 1/3" head.  
Aroma is delightful.   All that hop noise under the nose, usual descriptors of awesomeness, pick whatever tropical, stone and citrus fruits you want, mix in those pine/green/dank descriptors on top of it.  
Taste, wow, hop bursting, not overly aggressive ibu number, mouth feel that hides all the alcohol, super dry finish, like damn this is light on its feet but so damn huge.  
There are so many 10+% double and triple ipas these days, PTY no doubt was the innovator, but there are some damn good substitute goods out there (Notorious, Ephraim, Waldo etc. . . ) it really makes waiting in line seem dumb when you're this far down the rabbit hole. 982 charactersrodbeermunch, Dec 15, 2016

I was worried that because I was out of town and it has been quite warm by the time I got home the hops may have fallen off.  My worries were eased as soon as I cracked the beer open .  The smell instantly filled my nostrils.  Lemon, citrus, floral, pure deliciousness.   The crowler retained the carbonation well  and I got a good  amount of head.  The taste ... amazing.  Similar to the smell citrus and floral and not to bitter with just the right amount of sweetness.  Overall and awesome beer.   Hopefully I'll get to try it again one day. 587 charactersT_Hass, Jul 06, 2016

A- pours a bright and clear golden color with a two-finger foamy white head that retains for a while before settling into a ring around the glass, leaving some lacing behind
S- aroma is a mix of citrus fruit, mint leaf, green grass, garlic, alcohol & earthy resin
T- taste opens up with leafy, green, resinous hops, followed by some nice citrusy notes, that brings out flavors of tangerine and orange peel. Mid-palate brings out a bit of garlic-y hop flavor, along with  notes of red berries.  The finish is clean and green (leafy, minty hops), with a linger of just a hint of sweet malt
M- medium-heavy body with moderate carbonation leads to a creamy mouthfeel that continues into a clean finish, abv is hidden amazingly well
O- I've had lots of TIPA's, and almost off of them were too boozy, too malty & overly sweet.  This is not the case here, if there's such a thing as a balanced TIPA, this is it.  I would have never guessed that this was 11.5% ABV 1,014 charactersTreyliff, Jul 01, 2016

4.59/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I was really surprised by how much I loved this beer!  Sampled at the Growler Guys in Portland, where I picked up a growler can (don't know the technical term for these).  Shared with a friend, served it in a tulip glass.
Look:  Hazy golden color, foamy head that stayed around for a bit.
Smell:  Green onion, grass, a bit of citrus there as well.  
Taste:  Similar to the nose, except the citrus is upped by a few notches.  Flavor is really intense on the citrus flavor, the green onion comes through, a bit of spiciness, almost a light pepper.  Some maltiness there as well, which nicely balances out the heavy hop flavors.  Sounds like a really odd combination, but the flavors mesh together extremely well.
Feel:  Extremely smooth, almost like a heavy cream ale in a way.  No alcohol burn/boozy flavor in spite of the very high ABV.  Would not guess it's 12%.
Overall:  An extremely impressive triple IPA!  Has a wonderful balance of flavors, smells amazing, and drinks surprisingly easy for a 12% beer.  Highly recommended. 1,030 charactersjpearce4, Jun 16, 2016

5/5  rDev +10.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I've noticed that more than a few reviewers have described this triple as too sweet. Yes, it has a good deal of sweetness, but a lot of that can be attributed to the very skillful hopping which imparts a complex array of fruity esters to this delicious triple IPA. There is a full spectrum of tropical fruitiness, as well as a dynamic citric component, and even an undefined, subtle spiciness that really fleshes out the flavor profile. There is also a dank component that could be compared to the nose of certain marijuana strains, or even a certain plant that is redolent of cat pee. I don't mean this in a negative way, but rather as a further complement to the overall flavor profile. This triple IPA absolutely ranks among the upper echelon of its peers. 759 charactersMeow49, Jun 05, 2016
5/5  rDev +10.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5OMG! Perfect body, not too heavy, and not too light. Immensely complex flavor profile featuring peach, mango, guava, pineapple, papaya, strawberry, melon mandarin orange and tangerine. Could be a bit creamier, but the body is lightly syrupy, and that's just perfect for me. The heat is very restrained for 12%, and the finish is very long, smooth, and even candied (in a good way). Well deserving of its ranking. 412 charactersImpfan, Jun 05, 2016

I get a lot of pineapple on the aroma along with sweet, sticky hop resin. Taste is sweet apple, pineapple, grape, pear, and white wine. There's an earthy bitterness on the finish. The feel is syrupy, thick, and sweet and the 12% is well hidden. This is one of the better triple IPAs, but the style isn't one of my favourites. 418 charactersdanh53, May 30, 2016

If you can get it at its freshest in Bend, I am not sure you'll find a better imperial IPA, as it is incredibly well balanced, has a unique and smooth feel with a great finish that is not overwhelming but is just right for an imperial IPA that really hides the alcohol very well. 590 charactersJw383, Mar 14, 2016

Had a growler fill and then a second growler for later from Bert's growler garage in Ontario Oregon. Truely an amazing beer if you like IPAs that are a bit potent. Easily enjoyed (almost too easily) and lacks the extra sweetness that strong IPAs are known for. If you see this anywhere buy it. 342 charactersholysin, Jan 28, 2016

4.56/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.75Served On-Tap a number of times, updating from notes
A — Pours a coppery orange hue into the small glass. Great clarity. A thin white head sits atop the beer as a small layer of foam. Lacing is mostly consistent and sticky.
S — Smell is incredible, just flowing from the tap there are huge notes of orange juice, grapefruit, lemon, pineapple, pine needles, and light tropical tones. All these aromas come across with a minimal level of sweetness, just incredible overall.
T — A great balance is struck here between some lightly sweet honey notes set against a bitter and resinous piney chew. Notes of pineapple, orange juice, lemon, and melon round things out here. Fantastic.
M — Medium-Bodied, ample balancing carbonation, this does not have the off-putting cloying sweetness that most in this style have. This is impeccably balanced.
O — Just amazing beer here, I love most things from Boneyard and this is no exception, may be their best beer. Just don't tell anybody, because PNW beer is inferior, right? Love you Boneyard! 1,048 charactersMoose90, Dec 18, 2015

My first beer love.  It's been my favorite the past 4 years, but now we have a new King.  Notorious Triple IPA trumps my first love.  Amazing beer...hoppy, citrusy, and a little pine action. Other-worldy. It's like having two beers for the price of one with the over 10%ABV.  Love it! 524 charactersBigplayz, Oct 31, 2015

5/5  rDev +10.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Had this at Brouwers toward the end of a beer-tourism trip to Seattle. Over the last 5 days I've sampled dozens of IPAs, often asking brewers or bar owners for the one they considered the most explosively hoppy. This beer put every other one I've had to shame. By far the biggest, hoppiest, and most delicious IPA I've ever had.
Look: Crystal clear, pale golden colour. Fluffy head that stuck around until the bottom of the glass. Thick lacing as the beer disappeared.
Aroma: I had just finished a rather strong, hoppy double IPA and my palate was already accustomed to hops when this was placed in front of me. I could smell it clearly from a foot and a half away as the bartender served it. Gigantic, fresh, hoppy goodness. Lots of peach and other sweet fruits. Powerful pine/resin. Not heavy on the citrus but it was there. It is complex, but not muddled.
Taste: More of the same (lots of sweet fruit and resin), with some maltiness. Very balanced malts, not too sweet, they stay in the background where they should be. Every sip was explosive and surprisingly hoppy. There is a strong sweetness that is obviously from the hops and not the malts. Somehow deliciously 'planty,' not in the vegetal or grassy way that so many IPAs are. Alcohol was nearly hidden at 12% (how did they do this?)! Extremely well balanced and yet powerful.
Mouthfeel: Not even close to being astringent. Instead it's slick/sticky. Very sticky, like it was coating my mouth in oil. The bitterness (which is high but extremely smooth) was just a pleasant, smooth tingle. The beer was insanely drinkable and far from heavy or cloying.
Overall: As close to a perfect beer as I have ever had. It has raised the bar on IPAs for me considerably. An absolutely delicious, huge IPA. Now if only they distributed to Canada... 1,799 charactersdanbronson, Oct 05, 2015

5/5  rDev +10.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5As I rate more beers I am more likely to call BS on all 5's. Especially some of my own. This beer was perfect. On tap at The Hoppy Brewer. Beautiful bright copper/orange with a nice sticky head. The head lasted. I could have smelled it all night. An intoxicating melange of tropical, fruity and dank hops. They really married together to just create a wonderful aroma all it's own. The taste was an intense and bitter version of the aroma. No cloying sweetness. No burn of alcohol which is impressive in a 12% ABV beer. My buddy who is not as much of a beer but, immediately commented on how incredibly smooth it was. And he was right. For a huge beer it was insanely drinkable. These big bad Imperial IPAs can go off the rails really easy but a gentle hand was at work with this beer. Well done Boneyard! Really worth all 5s. 826 characterssergeantstogie, Sep 21, 2015

Look:  The body of this beer appears hazy, golden, and orange.  It looks thick coming out of the growler.  The head is white and creamy.  Sticky on the sides of the glass and persistent.  
Smell:  BOOM!  BAM!  BOOM! POW!   A salvo of sweet and pungent hops attacking my senses.  Sharp dankness, not regular dankness.  A dank hop bomb in my nose.  If I remember correctly, this smells similar to Pliny the Younger, only different. 
Taste:  Wow...Damn.  This reminds me of PtY, just different.  Super rich flavors of sweet and sharp hops combined with thick notes of pine.  Easy and likable bitterness. 
Feel:  This feels so right in my chomper.  Lower level of carbonation for a TIPA.  Heavier body.  Nice sudsy feeling.  This goes down smooth.
Overall -  The closest thing to PtY in my book.  There are not many IPA style beers that would surpass Notorious IPA. 938 charactersmabermud, Sep 15, 2015

Aroma is dank, dank, dank. Resinous pine and citrus.
Taste follows nose. Big sticky resinous pine and citrus hops balanced by a heavy dose of pale malt.
Mouthfeel is chewy, thick but well carbed.
Overall a huge imperial IPA, comparable to or even more impressive than Pliny the Younger. Dangerous. 366 charactersdraheim, Jun 28, 2015

4.51/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5On tap at Apex in Portland, Oregon. 
Pours a lighter yellow body, one finger thick white head with good retention; a small bit of lacing though not a ton. Smells of rich grapefruit and pine aromas, very sweet caramel and biscuit. Very rich aroma that coats my nose in a pleasant haze of sweet grapefruit rind. Very nice. Flavour is similarly separated into two extremes that don't clash at all; strong caramel and biscuit sweetness mixes in very nicely with a strong grapefruit and pine hop aromatic flavours, finishing with a moderately piney bitterness. No onions or off-flavours, simply a very clean expression of over-the-top hops and malts. Mouthfeel is full bodied, not syrupy, dry and just about perfect for any IIIPA I've had thus far. Overall, excellent IIIPA that is one of the best beers I've tried from the PNW. 824 charactersStevedore, Jun 26, 2015

I Have heard a lot of noise about this beer and boy was it deserved! this beer is truly a marvel. Every other IPA that I have had that rise to go well above 10% become very boozy tasting and can't carry the hop flavor past a musty pine, probably because of the amount of sweet wort needed to get the alcohol level that high. but this beer was full of juicy sweet tangerine, lemon, and passionfruit flavors backed with an impossibly dry malt body that gets completely out of the way of the hop bouquet. The look is the only slight problem, not much lacing or head, at least on the glass I had, but with close to 12%, thats not really surprising. Sometimes you head of a whale and its not all its cracked up to be, and while this may be (in the words of one well known brewer from the area) a "stunt beer" this is worth the hype and the best IPA I have ever had. Bad ass tap handle with the biggie pic as well; Bring this too Alaska! maybe for culmination in August?! 986 charactersoceanman907, May 22, 2015

4.55/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Unfortunatly the growler I received leaked, so the beer was flat.  Therefore take this review with a grain of salt.
That being said the absense of head (from being flat) actually makes this a very pretty beer.  Looks just like a glass of Mott's applejuice.
Despite having no head, the smell is fantastic.  I can't think of a better way to say this, but the smell is very heart warming.
The upfront taste is crips, clean and smooth.  I will pass on rating the back end because its flat.
Likewise, I will pass on rating the feel because its flat.
Overall this is a solid beer, and when I combine it with my memory of RPM and Hop Venom, I think this would be fantastic.  Looks like I'm back trying to trade for another growler as this was too good to not do it right.
Note: The entire review will be deleted and replaced if/when I get a new growler.
Updated for a new growler that wasn't flat.  Look is not as pretty because of the lingering lacing, but still a good looking beer.  The nose is basically the same of what I remember.  The taste is very crisp with a perfect balance of bitterness that lingers without ever getting in the way or offensive, making you want more the entire way.  The feel is a standard IPA feel, clearly overshadowed by the taste and smell.  Overall, still a fantastic west coast IPA. 1,317 charactersmrn1ceguy, May 05, 2015

Smells of fresh C hops, grapefruit, pine, evergreen, very fresh.  Tastes very crisp, lots of citrus, a bit of green apple, a bit of pine, a bit of boozy heat and nice malt backbone but not too bready.  Mouthful is smooth and creamy without being to thin or too chewy.  Doesn't feel its abv at all; tastes like a double IPA.  One of the best triple IPAs in this great land or anywhere.  Lived up to my expectations and more. 522 charactersIrishColonial, Jan 24, 2015

This is probably the most aromatic IPA I have ever tried. As soon as the bar keep set it down, everyone up and down the bar could smell it. Fresh pine, citrus primary, herbaceous and dank as a secondary impression. A very rounded hop nose
Color is deep gold / orange with a white effervescent head, medium size bubbles. Lighter than what you would expect for a 12%
Taste is a hopsplosion. Basically more of the fully rounded hop nose with the addition the right amount of bitterning, not too much, but still plenty. Good overall citrus and malt balance. For a 12% not a lot of malt or sweetness.
Mouthfeel is creamy, smooth and sticky.
A very big beer overall, but still drinkable. Closest to Pliny the Younger. Highly recommend. 766 charactersJerryG, Jun 15, 2014

A: Pours a bright golden with very little head that reduces to next to nothing. There's a slight copper tone in the color. 
S: This beer is quite possibly the most potent dank bomb I've encountered to date. Smelling this beer is nothing short of sticking your face in a freshly opened bag of hops. Citrus, grapefruit, and earthy floraly goodness that blows my mind. There's also a bit of bubble gum that started to come through as it warmed up a bit. 
T: The taste of this certainly compliments the aroma. Very fruity with lots of sweetness that masks the ABV very well. I do get a slight alcohol burn, but it's so well disguised in the flavor it doesn't even matter that it's there. 
M: Carbed very well, especially for a growler. With the thickness that a big beer demands, the carb level fits. Leaves a pretty dry after taste, but the flavor and aroma linger with the dryness. 
O: This is easily the best Triple IPA I've ever had. Prior to this I bench marked to Devil Dancer - no more. With receiving this as an extra, I had hopes of it being good, but I did not anticipate this at all. I will absolutely be seeking this out again. From now on, I am always ISO: Notorious. 1,267 charactersroger617, Mar 23, 2014

Decanted from a 32oz. growler into a Deschutes teku (I know, blasphemy, but I don't have a Boneyard glass yet). Translucent amber with a full finger of white head (held up amazingly after a week in the growler), which retains as a ringlet, lacing the glass nicely. Blast of fresh, juicy, West Coast hops in the aroma! Pine, oily grapefruit and orange, pineapple, cat pee, marijuana..it's pretty much hops all the way. More of the same in the taste, dank, rindy, citrus oils, tropical fruits, ammonia, pot; there's a definite sweet caramel malt base that can't be avoided, but unlike many DIPAs or "TIPAs" that turn into malt-bombs when the brewers try for that higher ABV, the malt profile here is very tame and the hops stay fully in charge. So I'd say the malt character is "quite appropriate." Speaking of ABV, I would never have guessed this at 12%...I mean there is some booziness for sure, and yeah, I'm definitely feeling the strength already, but tastewise, the alcohol intrusion is relatively moderate. Medium body, crisp but unctuous mouthfeel, moderate carbonation, slightly "sticky" in the aftertaste. This harkens back to the first time I tried Pliny the Younger, and I dare say I like this one better than PtY in the past 2 or 3 years. I want more of this...a lot more. 1,321 charactersRifugium, Mar 11, 2014

Great hop balance between citrus and tropical fruit. Nice light but flavorful malt profile.
The mouth feel is on the dry side, but this, in tandem with the incredibly balanced hop/malt combination is what helps to create the fantastic drinkability.

The smell is pungent tropical and citrus fruit with a bit of caramel. I get grapefruit, lemon, orange, mango, and misc. tropical fruits on the taste. It is a bit sweet, but not nearly as much as a lot of other triple IPAs. The feel is a bit resiny but overall this drinks incredibly well for the ABV. Overall, I'm pretty blown away by this one.

Score: 93
64 oz growler filled in early March and consumed 03/13/14. Fittingly served in a Hopslam snifter
Appearance: Pours an orange-copper color that slightly fades to golden hue at bottom of glass with a thin layer of head that totally settles. Not much lacing or retention to speak of, but the brew does has nice oily legs. 4/5
Smell: HUGE notes fresh mango slices and peaches in flush, along with notes of pineapple, orange, and grapefruit. Lovely pine character too. Caramel malt underlies the hoppiness, with a light tinge of alcohol. I really love the mango-forward fruitiness of the nose! 4.75/5
Taste: Bold, bitter with a heavy caramel malt backbone and delectable tropical fruit overlay. The tropical fruitiness is dialed down relative to the nose, but still amply present. Mango and grapefruit juiciness comes through mostly upfront, with the caramel malt, bitterness and a little booziness defining the finish. Has a lasting bitter caramel and pine flavor. 4.25/5
Mouthfeel: Medium body, low carbonation. Quite oily mouthfeel. Dry finish. Bitter, but has an underlying malty sweetness. 4.25/5
Overall: I could have sworn that the previous growler I had of this beer was less malty, but I enjoyed this beer thoroughly nonetheless. The ABV is not completely hidden, but this beer is dangerously crushable at 12% ABV. Boneyard makes some excellent IPA.
Cost: $25 for a counter-pressured 64 oz growler. 1,488 charactersjegross2, Feb 24, 2014

A- Poured a mostly clear orange color with soapy white head that left some splashy lace.
S- The aroma is a little off. I am getting a wet dog type smell and some fairly strong tropical fruit notes in the background. This beer bar has a good reputation and I have not have issues before, but I have a feeling the off order is due to unclean glassware.
T- Huge tropical fruit notes, big juicy mango, peach, pineapple, tangerine, and grapefruit notes. Very juicy hop notes, some sweet malt character and moderate to light bitterness.
M- Big warming, full bodied, very dry, not very sticky, and remarkably easy to drink for the ABV.
O- This tastes like a world class DIPA and is so easy to drink. My major knock on this beer was the aroma was a little unpleasant. I will give Boneyard the benefit of the doubt on this one and will definitely revisit this beer that I actually have wanted to try for a long time now. The aroma was a little off so I have to score the aroma the way it was in the glass, but I can't wait to try it again. 1,086 charactersHoptometrist, Feb 17, 2014

Thanks to drewone for sharing this one.
Pours a hazy orange with a foamy bone head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, citrus fruit, citrus zest, and slight herbal hop aromas. Taste is much the same with citrus zest and herbal flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a pretty good beer that is tasty but has a slightly better hop presence in the aroma. 663 charactersUCLABrewN84, Oct 28, 2013

4.5/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Appearance- Pours up about a half a finger of head which appears to have excellent retention. The head is a pure cotton white while the body is a pale amber which shows as a golden straw when held up to the light. A good amount of sheeting. 
Nose- Also subtle but still nice. Grapefruit with a warm mustiness. Some honey, orange and lemon. A hint of caramel. The mustiness builds and builds, making this beer more and more desirable. It also creates one of the nicest armpit aromas that I've ever encountered. Bright grapefruit and tangerine after being swirled. Lots of honey and caramel along with the strong must after it opens up. Some floral characteristics.
Taste- Starts off citrus (lots of orange and lemon with notes of tropical fruit). Lots of armpit mixed with caramel which moves into burnt caramel and matchstick. A very small amount of alcohol but it doesn't seem like a 12 % beer at all. Definitely will be a delight for a hophead but it also has enough juiciness and mustiness to appeal to the rest of us. Lots of grapefruit and earwax. The caramel mellow this out quite a bit. A really good beer that revealed itself to be a great beer when I drank it next to some Pliny. The juice, nectar, and honey build as this opens up. Ample spice finish pushes against the biter hops well- both the caramel and spice really rein in this beer. This beer has brilliant integration with overwhelming complexity. 
Mouthfeel- Light to medium bodied with minor notes of syrup. Carbonation matches the spice finish of the flavor profile.
Drinkability- Remarkably easygoing for a very hoppy and very alcoholic beer. 5 dollars for a 6 oz pour at Apex is a little steep while the 4 bucks for a 250 mL glass at Belmont Station seems like a steal.
Overall- Solid, great beer. At first, I understood the high ratings but did not appreciate them. Now, I do. This is a must try for almost anyone. This is one of those beers that has a linger that last for days. 1,958 charactersartoolemomo, Oct 21, 2013

served in snifter/goblet.
Clear, golden orange with a thin, foamy white head and nice lacing.
Wow, huge citrus notes. Grapefruit and tropical fruit hop notes with just enough crackery, sweet malt backbone to keep it in check. A slight boozy, warmth in the finish.
Medium body, foamy carbonation. The alcohol leaves a slight warming feeling without the boozy, burn of some high ABV beers.
A real treat that I am happy to have tried and that I certainly won't pass on in the future. The ABV comes through a bit, though I wouldn't have guessed it to be 12%. 584 charactersvkv822, Oct 06, 2013

A - White foam settles to a thick collar, cap, and splotchy lacework. Transparent golden body that is surprisingly lighter than Hop Venom was?
S - Big dank onion, grapefruit zest, burnt sugars, tropical fruit melange. Big, sweet, and brash, but with well-hidden booze. Aroma leaps out of the glass and strikes the appropriate balance for the gloriously American Triple IPA style.
T - The taste is a similar mix of brown sugar, caramel, tropical fruits, grapefruit zest, hint of chive, and moderate-to-low lingering hop bitterness. Again, no booze here; arguably crushable.
M - Medium-full body, with pleasant moderate carbonation that keeps things from getting to heavy. Dry finish, with some unsurprising warming alcohol; probably wouldn't guess 12% though.
D - This was awesome. Even though I was disappointed by Hop Venom, this beer saved the day and reasserted Boneyard as a fine purveyor of hoppy brews. I returned to the growler numerous times, and it unfortunately caught up to me about 8 hours later when I nearly fell asleep at Lincoln Tap Room. I'll be seeking this one out again. 1,152 charactersMasterSki, Jun 30, 2013

Appearance - Copper body. Not much of a heaf. Big bubbles in the collar. Otherwise just a bit of surface lace.
Smell - Very hoppy. Dank might be the descriptor, but I've never been big on that. Strong pine, grapefruit. Very simcoe-y. Some booze and sweetness.
Taste - Whoa, hoppy, boozy, and dry. Strong hop presence much like the smell. Simcoe and cascade would be my guess. Sweetness is very brief. It drops off quickly and makes it dry.
Mouthfeel - Never seems 12% heavy. Very well attenuated, but that has its pitfalls. Medium carbonation. Rough aftertaste.
Overall - I think I prefer the Hop Venom to this. It is a very impressive IPA for its size. Only a few breweries can pull this off, but this doesn't quite compare to things likr Ephraim. 791 charactersAlieniloquium, Apr 16, 2013

A: Pours a hazy orange with one finger of sudsy white head on top. Nice head retention, slowly reducing to a thin cap on top. Sheets of lacing form all around the glass. 
S: Could smell this beer as soon as it was set in front of me. Tons of citrus and tropical fruits. Grapefruit, tangerine, papaya, and pineapple. There is a faint malty sweetness and a little bit of alcohol as it warms. 
T: Follows the aroma with a ton of juicy citrus. More grapefruit, orange, pineapple, and tropical fruit. Very faint malt sweetness, but this one is all hops. Not overly bitter either. 
M: Medium to full bodied with moderate carbonation. Relatively easy drinking, probably because it tastes so good. ABV surprising at 12%. 
O: Wow, loved this beer. Finished my glass and ordered a second right away. Look forward to having it again. 868 charactersmdaschaf, Apr 02, 2013

This beer has a lot of hype. I haven't had the younger but I've heard and read that this is a legit rival. The accolades here are just deserved. This is delicious all the way through. Entirely drinkable while only feeling the alcohol vs tasting it. It's an initial grapefruit bomb splashed with tasty hops. The hops takeover but are in no way overpowering. If it weren't for being hammered I could drink this one for quite a while and not tire of it at all. It's thick but not syrupy. Absolutely delicious and happy to have found it before it went away for the year. A must try. 606 charactersswitzer, Mar 27, 2013

Pouts a slightly hazed gold color with a small white head.
Aromas are fantastic. Lots of pineapple, sugar, with some light floral hops and stinky resin.
Taste follows the nose. Big blast of pineapple up front, creamy, and somewhat sweet, with hard candy and sugar notes. Finish is resiny, sticky, with bitter pine, and a mixture of tropic fruits. No alcohol hints at all.
Mouthfeel is smooth, spot on carbonation, thick, but not heavy. Excellent.
Overall, superb. This beers can easily hold a candle to Pliny the Younger. While that beer was more of an assault on the taste buds and a sipper, this one is more much balanced and went down in gulps. 11.8% ABV?! Could have fooled me. Seek this one out, top notch, and brewed often enough that it isn't a pain to track down like PTY is. 879 charactersflexabull, Mar 19, 2013

First impression... Not what it was last year. Great, don't get me wrong, but things seemed to make their way to Portland much slower this year than last. This and Younger made much earlier appearances last year, and were that much more fresh. 
Last year this stuff reeked of pineapple, this year its much more subdued. Much more pine coming through, the citrus is more prominent as well. A good amount of sweetness, good carb, light head. Most people in PDX have been saying it was better than PtY this year. I think the age of both is the big factor as it was the other way around last year, but I'm still inclined to agree. 661 charactersZRBE, Mar 06, 2013

A clear, burnished copper with a dense, off-white head with excellent retention and moderate lacing. The nose makes me smile. Massive, juicy, pungent grapefruit, tangerine and pine hop aromatics are immediately apparent. Very, very fruity, with peach and mango buoyed by candied orange peel, weed and floral hop aromatics. Some honey and table sugar sweetness is noticeable.
The palate is great! Opening with a big, juicy, fruity grapefruit, orange, peach and some mango, this beer is loaded with hop flavor without a commensurate bitterness. Instead of bitterness, the fruity hop flavors segue into a dank, weed-like hop flavor and then, the sweeter, honey and candied citrus flavors. Some sugar is apparent in the mid-palate, lending a mild sugar syrup-like flavor to the finish. This, however, isn't to the beers detriment since this is incredibly fresh right nose, and the hop aromatics and flavor dominate. Along with this, fruity flavors and a mild pine bitterness linger on the finish. The nature of the finish is a little disappointing in that I expect my TIPAs to show a balance between (read: stuffed to the gills equally with) flavor, bitterness and oily hop resins, and in the second and third categories, this beer doesn't go happily overboard. Alcohol is shockingly well-hidden in this medium-bodied beer. The sweetness does hinder drinkability some; this isn't a beer I could drink a whole (2liter) growler of solo. Highly recommended. 
Where does this beer fall in comparison to other TIPAs? IMO, this should be tied for 2nd (along with the better batches of Exponential Hoppiness) behind Younger, and a step above Brass Knuckle/ Drake's Black Label.While I have a lot of quibbles about this beer, none are serious enough to make me not wish I had a second (tiny) growler for tomorrow night. 1,939 charactersDefenCorps, Mar 03, 2013

A: Light orange with a soapy-looking head that retained for a bit. Nice lacing. 
S: Possibly the best smelling beer I've ever tried. Bursting with tropical fruit. Pineapple, citrus, light grass. Smells like super fresh hops. 
T: Follows the nose with juicy citrus hops. Grapefruit, pineapple, citrus, and enough of a malt bill to keep things balanced. Hops don't make you pucker as it finishes and leaves the palate feeling nice and clean. So fresh tasting. 
M: Medium-heavy mouthfeel, but not syrupy or overwhelming. Alcohol is very, very subtle for a beer with this high of an abv. This might be more drinkable than it should be...

The beer pours a nice light orange and gold color, a ring of white head. 
The smell is the die for. Especially for a hop head like myself. It is just loaded with dank, dank hops. All kinds of hop aromas combine to form an amazingly appetizing and amazing aroma, I imagine they are using all kinds of northwest varietals for this. It's just so fresh and amazing.
The taste follows extremely close, it really tastes like an alpine super hoppy beer, which in my book is high praise. Super juicy citrus, plants, ganja, semi sweet malts, dank hops. Outstanding, just outstanding. 
The feel is awesome and sticky, great bitterness and aftertaste.

S: Green, pine, dank resiney hops jump out of the glass. Pure expression of hop. Just hints of a sweet malty base.
T: Hops dominate early until a strong sweetness takes hold. Pleasant bready caramel malt flavors are strong in the middle, with a really long finish of more (and more) piney hops. Oh the hops really shine in this one!
M: Definitley on the heavy, slightly sweet side. But I guess that should be expected in a huge triple IPA.
O: If you like hops, then you'll like this beer. If you like big, resinous, pine flavors, then you'll love this beer. Maybe not a PtY killer, but pretty dang close and available in growlerettes to go! 824 charactersoregonskibum, Feb 02, 2013

After an especially grueling day, I cracked this bad boy at 11:30 pm (yes, I do have to be at work at 9 am tomorrow, why do you ask?). 
A: Pours a clear pale golden-orange body with a half-finger of moderately retaining off-white head. Thin to nonexistent collar and scattered, broken bubbles on top of the beer. 
S: Candied grapefruit, orange, and tangelo. As it warms, light pineapple and peach tease in the background. I can smell the sugar here. I know this clocks in at 12%, but I can't pick up a whiff of that on the nose. Dangerous. 
T: Immensely balanced. It leads with citrusy hops, but with an undercurrent of grass that distract from the sugary malt sweetness. Make no mistake; it's an intense beer, with a lot of flavor, but it doesn't give the impression that any one flavor dominates over another. Grass becomes prominent in the finish and lingers into the aftertaste. 
M: This is warming on the way down, but there's no burn the ABV and almost no syrupiness. That's where Brass Knuckle and Drake's Triple Hopocalypse fell short, in my opinion. This one easily overcomes that hurdle and delivers a fantastic mouthfeel for such an aggressive beer. 
O: I hate to do this to every triple IPA that comes along, but I have to: I compare it to Pliny the Younger. Does this beat it? No. Is it an excellent, nearly-as-good alternative? Yes. Lately, given the shitshow to get Younger, I'm finding that nearly-as-good is a much better value. I'm a little surprised that there isn't more buzz over this beer, but I suspect that's because Portland is doing what Portland does best: drinking it. 1,730 charactersArbitrator, Jun 01, 2012

With notorious this is not the case. This has got to be one of the most balanced and surprisingly (dangerously) sessionable triple IPAs that I've ever had.
Serving type: hand bottle from Tony
Appearance is yellow-orange with a decent head (considering the miles traveled to Cleveland)
Aroma is dank, huge grapefruits, lots of pine, and a hint of booze.
Taste starts out by echoing the aroma with strong notes of grapefruit, pine, and a moderate hop bitterness that is backed up with what is at first only a subtly perceptible docket of honey-like malt flavors. The booze is slightly perceptible as the hop flavors fade (at 12% these liquor flavors are incredibly well hidden). The beer finishes strong with the malt flavors building to a sweet end-note that balance the lingering hop bitterness.
Mouthfeel is surprisingly light and dry considering the malts needed to achieve this kind of ABV.
Overall an outstanding example of the triple IPA. Delivers for the hop-heads, disguises its booze, and balances any lingering hop bitterness with a strong malt bill. 1,279 charactersdlawrence, Jan 10, 2012

A: Yellow gold with an inch of white foam.
S: Apricot blends with peach, mango, and passion fruit. Alcohol is light. The hop profile is bright and fresh, with a little underlying bready malt character. Floral hops emanate from the glass. 
T: Sweet citrus, reminiscent of apricot, orange, and grapefruit flesh with lighter rind notes. For 12% the alcohol is dangerously well hidden, until the finish that is. Malt imparts a little bread, sweetness, and caramel.
M: Medium in body with upper medium carbonation.

The beer pours a peachy gold color with good head retention and lacing. The beer certainly looks pretty good, but then I stuck my beak in the glass. Mama mia!!! On the nose I get an outrageous aroma of dank weed, huge pine, and dry citrus. This is one impressive smelling DIPA. The flavor profile replicates the nose in this "West Coast" all the way DIPA. The beer is pretty dry as DIPA's go, with just enough sweet malt and tropical fruit to balance the avalanche of hoppy goodness. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, and it's nothing short of amazing how light on its feet this beer is. Yet for all that, this beer is also a bit thick and viscuous on the palate. Otherwise, this beer drinks like a DIPA with considerably less alcohol, though the numbing sensation I experienced after just a single glass was a tip off that the alcohol was up there a bit. 
Just an absolutely superb DIPA from the folks at Boneyard. This beer reminds me very much of the outstanding Ephraim from Hill Farmstead. Very, very impressive.
Edit from 4/13. The new batch is out, and if anything, it's even better than the previous batch I had (no small feat). The current batch seems to have a bit more tropical fruit and an amazing sauterne flavor that I just love. I thought there a bit less pine on the nose, but there's still plenty of dank week and wet earth, which was plenty good enough to keep this hophead happy. What's truly amazing about this beer, however, is how well the alcohol is hidden. There's no heat whatsoever on the finish, and the light mouthfeel to this beer is nothing short of extraordinary. 
While still not in the same class as PTY (IMHO), this is the first beer I can recall having where I think it's something folks can argue about.. Yes, it really is THAT good!
Edit from 10/13. So the latest batch is now out, and I'll be damned, it's the best batch yet. It is becoming increasingly difficult for me not to give this beer a Younger-like score. 1,993 charactersJohn_M, Jul 28, 2011

This is a pretty crazy beer, a really interesting take on the triple IPA. Pours lighter than I expected, a tawny gold color, RPM IPA looks like a red ale next to this one! Pure white head bubbles up, a nice looking beer, though not what I was expecting for a triple IPA... cool!
Nose is hops hops hops. The hop bill reminds me a bit of RPM, and with the flavor, this beer could be an approximate triple of RPM. Which is awesome. Some of the solventy hop aromas are there, reminding me that this is indeed a triple IPA (Founder's Devil Dancer comes to mind for these aromas). Flavor is remarkably hoppy, but so hoppy that it kind of stuns the palate, making the beer seem less hoppy... does that make sense? Nicely carbonated, giving the beer a light refreshing feel. This is a really hoppy brew, focusing on the piney-herbal-floral side (I think), but definitely drinkable too. At 12%, this guy drinks like 7%, which is amazing. 
It's nice to try a triple IPA that drinks like an IPA and not one of the more laborious, sticky sweet TIPAs out there. Nice one here! 1,089 charactersLordAdmNelson, Jun 19, 2011

Bright white head, fairly quick dissipation, above average lacing. Deep gold clear body, multiple streams of carbonation. Nose is a slight bit more tropical than citrus, bready malts. Big hop blast up front in the taste, not overwhelmingly hop forward like a lot of other triple IPAs, re the Younger and that god awful Founders version. Mouthfeel is medium not a lot of effervescence. Dangerously drinkable, I had a hard time picking up any alcohol heat, which was a major surprise. I don't expect the growler of this I bring to PDX BA Beer Camp this weekend will last more than a couple of minutes. I wish all high ABV IPAs were this drinkable. This is a really good beer. Worth seeking out--or coming to Bend for!
EDIT-Bumped smell score up. Other than the Barley Brown's Head Shake, this is the closest thing aroma-wise to PP Poor Man's. 906 charactersjdense, Jun 14, 2011
