3.99/5  rDev -10.3%look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3 |  overall: 4Thanks to bellsfounder for sending this one! Reviewed from notes. Poured from a 12.7 oz. bottle into an El Catador Barrel-Aged glass.
A: Very dark brown, essentially opaque but remains translucent around the edges. Low amount of visible carbonation, and a thin tan band of foam. This does look a bit thin during the pour - this isn't glass-staining or anything, but it does have nice legs down the sides of the glass.
S: Cinnamon and spicy peppers hit first. Then chocolate, coffee, and roasted malts. Milder sweet vanilla also. There’s a bit of vegetal green pepper, though I'm not sure if this is from the coffee roasted malts or the spicy peppers or both. Either way, it’s not a huge part of the aroma. There's a touch of cola as well as it warms.
T: Chocolate, cinnamon, and spice peppers. There's less coffee than the nose suggested, but there’s still some coffee aspect to the roasted malts. Cacao, mild vanilla and some sweet aged leather. The spice from the peppers swells up near the end, along with some roasted and milder hop bitterness in moderation. The capsaicin lasts with sweet malts in the hang.
M: The alcohol content is well-hidden, and a bit low carbonation sensation but about average for style. As a double stout, the body is a bid thin - it's towards the thing side even if described as an American Stout.
O: Good. It's not close to Hunahpu, or Mexican Cake, Abraxas or Bomb! though. The mouthfeel is biggest detraction point here, but this falls a bit short in the richness of flavors as well. But it’s still tasty enough. I don’t get any oak – maybe just a hint of dryness towards the end? But the spicy peppers are more dominant, though never to the point of being obnoxiously spicy. It’s fine, though nothing I’d seek out like the obvious four comparison beers. 1,809 charactersmacrosmatic, May 20, 2017
4.3/5  rDev -3.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5375 ml bottle into snifter, 2016 vintage bottling. Pours opaque dark brown/black color with a 1 finger dense tan head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a light amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, maple, caramel, toffee, brown sugar, molasses, walnut, vanilla, cinnamon, pepper, oak, fudge, and toasted dark bread; with light notes of smoke, char, dark fruit, herbal, and roast/toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/roast/bready malt, walnuts, spices, and oak notes; with great strength. Taste of huge milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, maple, caramel, toffee, brown sugar, molasses, walnut, vanilla, cinnamon, pepper, oak, fudge, and toasted dark bread; with light notes of smoke, char, dark fruit, herbal, and roast/toasted earthiness. Light-moderate roast/char bitterness and light pepper/cinnamon spiciness on the finish. Lingering notes of milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, maple, caramel, toffee, brown sugar, molasses, walnut, vanilla, cinnamon, pepper, oak, fudge, toasted dark bread, light smoke/char, herbal, and roast/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt, walnuts, spices, and oak flavors; with an awesome roasted bitter/sweet and spice balance; with zero cloying/acrid flavors after the finish. Light dryness from roast bitterness and spiciness, lightly increasing through the glass. Medium carbonation and fairly full body; with a very smooth, creamy/silky, lightly slick/sticky/chalky, and slightly tannic balanced mouthfeel that is great. Minimal warming alcohol for 10%, with zero lingering pepper heat after the finish. Overall this is an incredible spiced imperial stout! All around fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt, walnuts, spices, and oak flavors; very smooth and dangerously easy to sip on for the big ABV. Extremely well rounded imperial stout complexity, with pretty much perfect balance of spices. Never overwhelming, but a touch more drying than I’d prefer. A highly enjoyable offering. 2,209 characterssuperspak, May 20, 2017
4.41/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25A - inky black, opaque.  Very thin head around the rim.
S - lightly toasted everything.  Cocoa, walnuts, malt, peppers (?)
T - inline with the smell, there is an element of heat, not sure from what.
M - Nice level of carbonation.  Seems like something that would benefit from nitro instead of co2.  Nice level of coating and aftertaste.
O - fantastically executed, well balanced.  Jackie O's is notoriously overpriced (IMHO), this one was $8, but this may be the first of 10+ beers of theirs that I'll buy another of. 517 charactersjwilcox767, May 14, 2017

4.41/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Poured into one of my tulip glasses out of a 12/7 oz. bottle, this beer pours a very dark brown color that is not interested in letting any light whatsoever.  Has a tan brown head that's an inch thick when first poured that eventually settles to a nice tick surface coating of foam along with a thick ring lining the inside of the glass with some nice lacing.  Very strong aromas of cocoa nibs, vanilla, cinnamon, and oak along with a hint of chili pepper spice along with some roasted nuts, strong hints of figs and raisins and a bit of coffee.  The taste is pretty much the same, with cocoa and vanilla notes with a bit of roasted, bready caramel malt sweetness.  This gives way to a nice oak presence and a bit of chili pepper spice that gives way to some roasted nuts.  All of this is then followed by some sweet hints of figs, plums, and raisins.  All of this is finally rounded out with notes of black coffee and some earthy hop bitterness.  Has a slightly crisp, somewhat chewy and oily/sticky, fairly smooth and creamy, medium to full bodied mouthfeel with moderate carbonation.  Has a pretty dry aftertaste, and the spice notes fro the chilies along with the black coffee and hop bitterness linger on the palate for a long time after each sip.  The bitter notes do see to be slightly dominant over the other flavors.  Very decadent.  The 10% ABV is well masked.   An excellent beer all around.

3.68/5  rDev -17.3%look: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 3.5Pours very dark oil black in color with an off-white head that laces the glass before disappearing.  Aroma of chocolates, malt sweetness, dark soy sauce and fruity alcohol esters.
The flavor has vanilla, roasted malt, dark chocolate, soy, with just a little spice from the cinnamon and peppers.  Spices build a little as the beer warms, mostly deep chocolate and the soy which could point to a slight oxidation.  
Full bodied beer with a complex finish from the added spices and peppers.  Alcohol is perceived but not overpowering.
Overall, it's good beer, and very complex, but the soy aspect due to possible oxidation was distracting.  A lot of beers from Jackie O's taste the same way and seems that dark beers from them really carry this oxidized note; maybe its by choice? 777 charactersStinkypuss, Apr 26, 2017

Look- Pours a very dark brown leaving a finger of lingering tan foam. A bit of lacing and oily residue is left clinging as it settles. 
Smell- Figs, raisins, toffee, ground walnuts, molasses and bakers chocolate. 
Taste- Once again dark fruit including figs, raisins and dates, followed by fresh chopped walnuts, molasses, dark chocolate and earthy peppers. There's a hint of cinnamon that's buried under all the other bold flavors. 
Feel- Oily and on the medium side of the stout viscosity scale with some pronounced pepper heat in the finish. 
Overall- A big and bold stout that is heavy on dark fruit taste and some prominent pepper heat. It's a serious sipper that could benefit from more cinnamon and or vanilla to balance the heat from the habanero peppers that kill anything trying to poke through in the finish. Or perhaps a milder pepper instead as habanero's can get overpowering? With that in mind, its probably a good cellar candidate. Interesting beer, I'd love to try the barrel aged version. 1,132 charactersPrager62, Mar 19, 2017

4.76/5  rDev +7%look: 4.25 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75L - pours mostly black with the faintest of crimson hues. Might just be imagining that though. Little head, even after upping the vigor halfway through the pour. A mini wave of head jets up from the bottom of the glass after the pour and gives me a mocha chocolate 1/8 inch head that disappears as quickly as it came. 
S - I had to push this beer away while doing the "Look" section because it was so distracting! Immediate vanilla positively explodes with cinnamon and spice. It's like Christmas! Incense! Nuts and chocolate malt. Pepper heat in the very finish. I can feel it in my throat. Excellent aroma. 
T - habanero heat is much more prevalent in the taste. Whoppers and milk chocolate up front, blanketed by supple vanilla and ground cinnamon. It's like doing the cinnamon challenge. I can even feel the powdery grit on the roof of my mouth. Incredible. Wood without any sort of boozey liquor flavor. Just raw oak, like chewing on bark. Walnuts toward the end duke it out with the habaneros. Leaves a lingering heat that tickles the lips and numbs the throat. Burping yields burnt coffee roast. 
F - soft and creamy--doesn't feel like 10%+ at all. Drinks like chocolate milk with huge, robust, full-bodied fluff. 
O - great stout with loads of unique and interesting flavors. They're all so prominent too, and take turns being the star as this liquid gold slides down my gullet. Only complaint is that the heat is a little turned up. A "touch of heat" my ass. This will light you up if you're not expecting it. I wasn't. I'd be curious to see how age affects the heat levels. 1,587 charactersagreenman19, Mar 10, 2017

4.31/5  rDev -3.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Poured into a Duvel tulip.  
A- Pours a fully opaque black color with a 1/2 inch tan head that retains well before becoming a thick ring around the edge of the glass and a mostly full sheet of surface foam.  Semi-resilient lacing leaves large clots behind.
S- Cinnamon is the first note and it's big.  A distant second is the cacao nibs and an even more distant third is the habanero bringing just a bit of green pepper essence to the table.  After a big swirl, the vanilla finally comes through and creates a malted milk ball character.
T- Great melange of vanilla and cinnamon sweetness with a finish of chocolate.  The walnuts are even there providing a nice earthy dryness mid-palate and in the finish.  The habanero slowly creeps in and builds a capsaicin burn.  Pretty damn complex.
M- Creamy with medium carbonation and a fullish body.
O- I've always been a bit weary of this one due to the habanero but finally took the plunge to score a bottle.  While, yes, there is a clearly discernible pepper heat to it, it has enough balance and sweetness to counteract the burn.  Quite tasty and I'm glad i gave it a shot. 1,125 charactersImmortale25, Feb 19, 2017

4.21/5  rDev -5.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Pours a syrupy dark brown with virtually no head. Aroma is primarily cinnamon, vanilla, chocolate and hints of roasty malts. Flavor is big on spices up front with the cinnamon coming through big, followed by chocolate. The finish is where a little bit of the pepper creep in, with some lingering heat on the finish. Not too sweet, not too hot, smooth and dry on the finish. Pretty nice take on the style, good pepper presence if you like that, but certainly not spicy hot. 472 charactersstephenjmoore, Jan 13, 2017

4.5/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.52016 version - pours deep brown with almost no head.  There is some lacing from the ring.  The smell is walnuts immediately and then milk chocolate and a slightly sour, spicy smell.  The taste is strong spice and chocolate with an aftertaste of walnuts. It's slightly boozy also.  The spices are very well done.  They are forward without being overwhelming.  The chocolate, walnuts and even a slight vanilla bourbon flavor comes through. There is a definite chili spice mixed in also.  Finally a burnt oak flavor lingers on the finish that's slightly unpleasant.  The mouthfeel is a little thinner than expected and highly carbonated.  Overall, this is an incredible beer.  Very well balanced and way too easy to drink for 10%. 727 charactersjvgoor3786, Jan 13, 2017
4.63/5  rDev +4%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Let me start by saying there are two things I don't want in a beer. Bourbon and vanilla. This has both and I still loved it. I normally hate the taste of bourbon in beer but in this beer it was there in balance and added to the beer instead of detracting. The vanilla, cacao and cinnamon are all there but not all at once and none overwhelming the other. The only thing I would like is a little more heat from the habanero but from other reviews I guess this changes depending on the peppers that particular year. Overall a tremendous beer that will have you paralyzed by the end. More chocolate than anything a little sweet from the bourbon and chocolate but the pepper knocks down the sweetness. Amazingly not syrupy although a black viscous motor oil like pour. 764 characterstjwarren, Jan 07, 2017

Look: Pitch black, thick and oily appearance as poured. Coarse, mocha head from semi aggressive pour, about a finger in size. Ended as a thick cap of lacing after settling.
Smell: Rich, sweet cocoa, nutty coffee, vanilla, cream, cinnamon, minimally boozy.
Feel: Full bodied, rich and smooth as silk.
Taste: As complex as the aroma. Roasty, sweet cocoa, coffee, almonds, cinnamon, and sweet vanilla and cream. Finishes slightly bitter to balance the sweet.
Overall: Great Christmas present! Been wanting this for a long time, and it didn't disappoint. Beautifully complex. 666 charactersBonkinishwa, Jan 01, 2017

This is an unbelievable beer. Perhaps my favorite of 2016. 354 charactersBierRunner, Jan 01, 2017

S: not a huge aroma, Chocolate, cinnamon and spice.

Smell:  Roast, chocolate, cinnamon, walnut and piquant habanero tones
Taste:  The habanero comes in waves, the first one bringing hot cinnamon and chocolate, and the second one bringing the roast and walnuts; the subtler tones of vanilla and tiramisu can be detected in the finish, though the habanero lights up the taste buds increasingly
Mouthfeel:  Medium to full body with moderate carbonation; warmth in the gullet and heat on the palate
Overall:  Nicely balanced, with the habanero bringing just enough heat so that the other elements can be detected

4.28/5  rDev -3.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Imperial stout brewed with walnuts conditioned on spices. According to the bottle, it is the brewer's Oil of Aphrodite infused with cacao nibs, vanilla beans, oak staves, habaneros, and cinnamon sticks. The pour is very dark brown, nearly black, and sports an impressive and lasting khaki head. I get some rich toasty notes on the nose as well as cocoa, nuts, toffee, and a little cinnamon.
Full body with a creamy feel and a rich, complex flavor. I get sweet treacle toffee notes and vanilla up front, then the flavor turns to bitter chocolate and roasted malt. As the bitterness intensifies, it begins to turn into heat from the chilis and spiciness from the cinnamon. These final flavors linger nicely on the finish along with some of the vanilla and just a hint of alcohol warmth.
Very pleased that I got to try Jackie O's take on the ``Mexican-Style Stout". This is one of those rare beers that seems to handle multiple flavors extremely well. Everything balances out, nothing overpowers, and the flavors seem to develop one by one across your palate. It's not a beer I'd want to drink all the time, but I can appreciate an extremely well-crafted beer when I see one. 1,174 charactersdeadonhisfeet, Dec 12, 2016

S - cinnamon predominantly. Vanilla, oak, chocolate and more cinnamon. Dark fruits and brown sugar. Very sweet nose.
T - wow. Lots of phases. Huge cinnamon up front, abruptly shifting to a dry, bitter baking chocolate in the middle and finally taking a third drastic turn on the finish with peppery heat and a mild burn afterwards. In the middle there's also vanilla, tobacco, a chalky Coca-Cola flavor and an overpowering char that leaves you feeling like you just licked a burnt sirloin. Surprinsgly this doesn't have the sweetness I was expecting from the nose.
F - immensely dry. Very toned down carbonation. Neither thin nor fudgy for the abv - about what you'd expect.
Overall - It is unique, I'll give it that, but I'm genuinely surprised that this is a top 250 beer. I may buy again if I happen across it... but will certainly never hunt this. 986 charactersrypkr, Oct 08, 2016

4.5/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5375 ml bottle, 2016 vintage.  Served in a Jackie O's snifter, the beer pours dark brown/black with about an inch tan head.  The head retention and lacing are both pretty good.  Aroma is nice, the brew smells like chocolate, cinnamon, chili peppers, vanilla, roasted malt and some woodiness.  For the most part I think the taste is the same as the aroma, but there's also some coffee and nutty flavors noticeable too.  The pepper flavor gets stronger as the brew warms.  The heat is there, but not overpowering and it meshes with all the other flavors really well.  Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's creamy and a bit coating with moderate carbonation.  I thought it was a really good spiced imperial stout.  I know I'd like to buy this again!  $8.99 a bottle. 760 charactersbluejacket74, Aug 20, 2016

T - Follows the nose with some added roast. Everything seems perfectly balanced.
M - Full, creamy, smooth
O - This one was a surprise. I've had some hits and misses from Jackie O's and this one is a huge check in the hit column. Thoroughly enjoyed. 409 charactersNJBrews609, Jul 16, 2016

There is a sort of fruity, sweet spiciness on the nose, with soothing cinnamon, luscious hot chocolate, and I can actually get a hint of that walnut.
Walnutty chocolate in taste, followed by cinnamon, and that fruity spiciness on the back end, sort of like rice pudding with strawberry and cayenne pepper. I think this may be the vanilla. At room temperature it finishes roasty.
Oro is a smooth beer with some heft, but not a lot. Definitely my favorite Jackie O's beer thus far. 614 charactersSabtos, Jul 13, 2016

Pours jet black with a tan rim of a head.
Aroma is of biscuit malt, coffee beans, and licorice.  
Flavor is of roasted coffee, licorice, caramel, cinnamon, cocoa, and chili peppers.  
Medium to full body with a stinging carbonation and the notable burn of chili spiciness.  
Excellent stout with lots of good flavor and aroma, pours beautifully.  The spiciness of the peppers is a welcome deviation from the norm.  Definitely worth trying. 482 charactersCylinsier, Jul 03, 2016

Look - black as night with a thin brown head.  really thick
Smell - spices, cocoa, more flavors as it warms
Taste - baker's chocolate, oak, malty dark chocolate, hazelnuts, and after warming the vanilla and cinnamon really shine
Feel - really creamy, no booze, very smooth and drinkable
Overall - a very enjoyable imperial stout.  the flavors really blend well together and the complexity is executed very well.  Will seek this out again 510 charactersrabbott2, Jun 06, 2016
4.48/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Appearance - Now this looks the part of a stout, unlike my experience with BA Wood Burner last night. Jet black with a dark khaki head which quickly recedes back into the abyss. 
Aroma - The nose is melange of varying aspects ranging from the cinnamon, oak, chocolate, and pepper. It is very cohesive and smells fantastic. It does seem... 'muted' at times, where I have to really get in there to pick out certain notes.
Taste - Right from the start I am really digging this beer. The base beer leads the taste with a nutty, chocolately flavor. This is met next by a subtle oak flavor that gradually blends into a potent cinnamon punch. Cinnamon in beer is a tough ingredient to balance, but when it's done right, it elevates a beer to great heights in my opinion. Jackie O's nails that aspect here. I was expecting a bit more pepper actually; what is there is a warming heat at the back, without much if any actual pepper flavor. Don't go into this thinking you'll be blown away by the spiciness.
Mouthfeel - The mouthfeel is quite nice. Perhaps a touch thin for my preference of the style, but the low carbonation works.
Closing Arguments - Overall, while not my favorite stout from Jackie O's, this is a very nice beer. All of the ingredients are balanced and as it warms it especially is tasty. 1,301 charactersnhindian, Jun 06, 2016

A:  Pours a dark chocolate brown with a tan head that settles down quickly but maintains and laces well throughout.
S:  Cinnamon, nutmeg and hey those walnuts are talking!  A little coffee and roast in there, but the spices are so lively the Mexican hot chocolate character comes through.
T:  Sweet and malty up front, with nutmeg and cinnamon on the back end.  
M: The alcohol is just a little warming.  This stout is a touch thin through the waist, but it doesn't take away from it.  The cinnamon on the tongue gives the impression of heat on the palate.
O:  Enjoyable.  Lots of good flavors dancing around. 647 charactersFBGordon, Jun 01, 2016

Smell is amazing. First thing I notice is cinnamon, milky lactose, nuttiness and a bit of coffee.
Following the nose pretty well, you get that cinnamon bomb. Then you get nice profiles of bakers chocolate, caramel, vanilla and cream. Bitter roasted malt in the back end.
Mouthfeel is chewy and oily. Cinnamon coats the palate, slight pepper kick in the back end. 453 charactersMateo2699, May 22, 2016

Finishes off with some lingering heat, and a nice walnut bitterness on the palate a minute or so after swallowing.  Feels silky and smooth, not too dense, but coats the mouth nicely to leave you eager for the next sip.  Amazingly complex and balanced, truly one of the best flavored stouts I've ever had. 579 charactersSaisonRichBiere, May 09, 2016
4.2/5  rDev -5.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25Bottle into a snifter. Black as night, and topped off with about 1 finger of bubbly, khaki-colored foam. The head bubbled down to a spotty lacing almoet immediately. Strangely aromatic nose of sweet lactose, cacao, roasted malt, ripened fruit, bubblegum, vanilla, and chiles. Bittersweet, roasty, a d a bit spicy. Upon tasting, I'm met with a wall of cinammon coupled with light notes of habanero peppers, roasted malt, baker's chocolate, and vanilla beans. Probably the most cinammon-forward beer I'fe ever had, even beyond most pumpkin ales. What's left in the spices' wake is a medley of bittersweet dessert, such as chocolate, caramel, vanilla, and coffee. Pronounced habaneros, but not at all like a chile beer (meaning the flavor is there, but not the spicy effect). Dense and chewy, like most of Jackie O's big stouts. Same chewiness as Dark App, BBA Oil of Aphrodite, Black Maple, etc. I love the unique characteristics that this particular beverage encompasses, though, with the chiles and cinammon. A weird combination of ingredients that wouldn't work at the hands of most brewers. Another homerun for the boys & girls from Athens, though.
Definitely a sipper, and definitely different. Tasty as hell, too. 1,218 charactersdo_ob, May 09, 2016

 Aroma: Walnuts and cinnamon take the front here but the habanero comes through.
Taste: Same as nose (for the most part, could use a little more habanero).
Feel: sticky, fairly thick and delicious. I feel this is one of Jackie O's calling cards.

4.56/5  rDev +2.5%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5This beer pours an opaque black with a one finger tan mocha head that quickly fades to a small ring around the edge. Few spots of lacing. Smell is cinnamon, chocolate, oak, nuttiness, and a touch of sweet vanilla. Taste is the same with cinnamon the star of the show and a little heat from the peppers on the finish. Feel is medium and slick, a little lighter than I expected. Slight tingle on the finish from the heat. Overall an amazing beer. I prefer bomb, but only marginally. 480 charactersCNoj012, May 04, 2016

Poured into a Darkness snifter
Nothing to impressive with the appearance. Standard looking Imperial Stout. Not a lot of head. The Aroma was subdued as well. Hints of cinnamon, cacoa, chocolate. The taste is where this one shines. Definitely reminds me of a tamer Hunahpu. Cinnamon and habanero come out strong, vanilla sweetness, chocolate, nutty backbone. Really complex beer. Very much enjoyed this offering from Jackie O's. 456 charactersChriscrundwell12, Apr 21, 2016

Holy hell, the aroma kicks it into gear: cocoa, vanilla, cinnamon, chillis, char, sublet earth and oak.
One of the few brews that really come as advertised. Fantastic combo of the chocolate, vanilla and peppers with the cinnamon and oak bringing up the rear but that spice tingle lingering and dancing across excited taste buds. Wow!
Full body, char and pepper chew, nicely viscous, well carbonated.
It really doesn't get better than this. Hail Jackie O's! 591 charactersCaptCleveland, Apr 09, 2016

Taste was smoother, good chocolate and oatmeal feels.  The vanilla, cinammon and chili was after that.  Habanero didn't really come across.  Made me wish for that Melange beer that has all this stuff plus bourbon.   Walnuts don't do anything for the beer that I can tell. 
Was a good beer during a week of so many excellent beers. 447 charactersrodbeermunch, Apr 03, 2016

Nose is fantastic - big cocoa, cinnamon, ginger sweetness.  Fantastic.
Flavor is an on point explosion - vanilla, cinnamon, oak, caramel, chocolate and finally a touch of heat that sets it all off.  This is a fantastically full profile that in no way seems muddled as it might be.  I am missing the nut but that seems to come through in the feel.
Carbonation is on point.  Perfect body and viscosity.
This is a damn near perfect beer. 570 charactersoldn00b, Mar 05, 2016

4.65/5  rDev +4.5%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 12.7 oz. bottle into a Belgian tulip.
Look:  Poured a used motor oil black color and viscosity.  Only the thinnest amount of a khaki tan head formed during the pour and then dissipated quickly.  Only the slightest appearance of a root beer brown coloring around the edges when held up to the light.
Smell:  Holy Jesus!  Talk about everything present at once?!  Cinnamon, roasted malts, vanilla, peppers and the walnuts are present too!  Mouth watering immediately.
Taste:  Matches perfectly to the aromas coming out of the glass!  You have to love it when that happens, no surprises or let downs.  Vanilla, cinnamon, oak and then you get that slight burn in the back of the throat from the habanero peppers. The slight walnut aroma is not obvious in the taste.
Feel:  Smooth body with little to no carbonation.  The spices more than make up for that; alcohol strongly hidden.
Overall:  Loved this beer!  There's something about a well made stout and when you balance that with the spices and other additions this makes for a fabulous tasting beer.  If I can get more of this, I'd do it in a heartbeat.  Thanks to WesMantooth for this one! 1,157 charactersjhartley, Feb 29, 2016

4.22/5  rDev -5.2%look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25Received in trade thanks to BA PJ_ offering it up to compare against the heavyweights in one of my favorite substyles of beer. Enjoyed out of a 375 ml brown bottle and poured into an oversized snifter glass.
Appearance (4.25) - Pours a somewhat viscous-looking cola brown that looks almost black once it's poured into the glass. The head is an apologetic half finger at best--khaki colored--and lasts for a short few moments before turning into a partial ringlet around the edge of the glass and a whisper of film across parts of the surface of the liquid. No lacing to be seen.
Smell (4.00) - I have to admit, I'm a little disappointed that there isn't more of an aggressive aroma here given the assertive ingredients contained therein. There is some mild bakers chocolate and the subtle hint of generic spiciness, but none of that pungency of cinnamon or the richness of vanilla. After it warms, I do get some mild nuttiness that I can only assume comes from the walnuts. I just wish the entire thing was a bit more forward. 
Taste (4.25) - I found the spices I was looking for. Here the cinnamon and cacao come through much more alongside a nice walnut characteristic that is nutty and rich, and the vanilla exists to soften it all together. The best part is the fact that there is a bittersweet combination of char from the roasted malts and additives that prevents this beer from straying into dessert territory. You can enjoy the suggestions of things like Mexican hot chocolate and chocolate-cinnamon cake without any cloying sweetness.
Mouthfeel (4.5) - Medium to full-bodied, with low carbonation and a semi-sweet finish.
Overall (4.25), a really nice beer that acquits itself quite well against the likes of Abraxas, Huna, Mexican Cake, etc. The walnuts really make this beer stand out from the rest, but I'm not sure it's in a way to which I'm partial. The style is already full of flavor additives, so it's easy to go overboard. I think the walnuts ultimately spend too much time competing with the cinnamon and peppers. But still, a fantastic and unique take on the substyle. 2,093 charactersLambicPentameter, Feb 23, 2016

Different than I expected, the spices are unique but don't seem to quite mix with the rest of the beer. Decently made but just not my flavor profile. Completely different than the spiced stouts that people are comparing it to and IMO not as good. Common ground and other Jackie Os offerings are on the mark but Oro Negro didn't quite make the cut for me. I wouldn't trade over top notch stouts for this one. 451 charactersLapalou, Feb 06, 2016

In thick pour with good creamy mouthfeel and nice head retention. I get a lot of notes of walnut, but the spices were not my thing. It's very complex, but the spices were just not my fave. 259 charactersBeerSamurai34, Jan 21, 2016

4.27/5  rDev -4%look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Tan head with lace. Dark brown, nearing black, in color. I could tell it was a little thin when I poured it.
Very huna like but not as thin. It has the vanilla, cacao, cinnamon, but the walnuts are obviously hard to find. I like that this beer brings some heat to the table. The habaneros show nicely and really make this beer what it is. None of the spices are overpowering which also helps. 
Only flaw this that it is thinner than I want for an imperial stout. A bit roasty on the feel.
Solid offering that I would love to have more of. 541 charactersmothman, Jan 15, 2016

4.08/5  rDev -8.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4A big thanks to Jeff for this one. Continually delivering the goods! 375ml capped bottle into a Grrrz teku. Shared with schen9303. 
One smell and its apparent that this is a spiced stout. Notes of cinnamon and chili complement the traditional imperial stout aromas. Roast is minimal but sweetness is apparent and only accented by the spices. One sip reveals incredible balanced. Sometimes these beers are overly smoky, overly sweet or overly spicy. This is none of those. Hints of roasted malt, cocoa powder, chocolate, cinnamon and chili pepper in the middle and end work very well together. This is delicious! 
Sadly, its not all good. Body is a touch lacking. Above average still but a bit on the thin side. Good level of (lack of) carbonation makes this slick and smooth which is nice but there's a chewiness that I'm craving here.
Very good and certainly worth trying overall. A really interesting creation from Jackie O's. 931 charactersSpeedwayJim, Jan 07, 2016

S - smell is cinnamon and cacao with a balanced pepper heat.  Complex and magnificent.
T - taste is all the parts.  Cinnamon and a little Cocoa up front.  Peppers and heat follow.  Then a nutty walnut finish with a little habanero.
F - silky smooth with a pepper heat at the end.   Damn near f'ing perfect.  Closest beer I can remember is Madeira Black Tuesday.  So good.
O - every bit as good as Huna and abraxas.  Actually better.  Will hunt the version they have in bourbon aging in he back.  Great great beer.  Most complex beer I've ever had without a spirit barrel. 619 charactersWolberjs, Dec 23, 2015

4.79/5  rDev +7.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5Look:  Dark and viscous appearance.  The head is fine and light beige.  It quickly regresses to a fine halo  with a few patches of head left behind around the middle of my favorite 15.5 ounce brandy snifter.  The curtains and legs are slick, broad and fine.   They leave behind long crooked branches across the glass.  Very nice looking.  
Smell:  First whiff = BA Xocoveza on steroids.  Follow up sniffs make me think of spice and walnuts.  The thought of walnuts is there, only because I read it on the label.  There is a short oily nut aroma.  The smell is thick and oily.  Yum!
Taste:  Yup, this reminds me of Xocoveza, only much better, with a BA twist and spicier.  The same, but different.  Do you know what I mean?  Spicier, much hotter, and very tasty.  Even sweetness.  The habanero is there, but not enough for me.  It does have a nice little sting as the beer warms.   The taste is rich, and the finish is long.  The black walnuts make this stand apart from other beers of this type.  Oh, the nuts in my mouth are good.  Cocoa, vanilla, and cinnamon play a nice role.  Everything is nicely integrated.  The habanero adjunct is excellent.          
Feel:  Since I am using Xocoveza as a comparison, I can say this beer is fuller and thicker.  This has a lower level of carbonation and is creamy, and very pleasant throughout.
Overall -  Jackie O's makes Bomb stouts.  As this beer warms it blossoms.  Think of a souped up BA Xocoveza with a habanero twang.  I really appreciate what this beer brings to the table.  I received three bottle, was going to trade one, but have decided to keep all of the bottles for myself.  All mine.  I will ravage this beer over and over.  I love her.  She's so beautiful. 1,716 charactersmabermud, Nov 14, 2015

A: Pitch-black pour with a mid-sized fizzy dark brown head. Halfway decent head retention and very sparse lacing. 
S: Hmph, spicy. Cinnamon and chili pepper is immediately noticeable. Lots of cocoa too. Mildly nutty.
T: Lots of cinnamon and walnuts up front. Chili peppers kick in shortly afterwards with a respectable amount of heat - nothing too crazy though. Bittersweet chocolate throughout. Some charry roasted malt mixing with the chocolate in the finish. Light vanilla and bittersweet chocolate lingering in the aftertaste with just a hint of the cinnamon and peppers. 
M: Heavy, smooth and spicy brew. Low carbonation.
O: Crazy stout. Lots of great bittersweet roasted malt and chocolate characteristics, backed with the spicy chili pepper and cinnamon. Stellar combination. Didn't get a ton of walnuts or vanilla but they're probably just overpowered by the rest of the flavors. Everything is big and bold but well integrated and balanced. 968 charactersDope, Nov 14, 2015

Ther is something  going on here with the cinnamon, licorice and slight mint feel.   The look is jet black hosting a skim of biscuit brown head.  The flavor has even more going on.  Black licorice, cinnamon, dark chocolate,  and a consistant pepper feel is all over the place.   So much flavor it is hard to call this a stout, just an explosion of flavor.  So unique. I would love to try this one with several years of age. 507 charactersSPLITGRIN, Nov 14, 2015

A- pours pitch black in color with a one-finger creamy khaki colored head that retains for a while before settling into a ring around the edge
S- creamy dark chocolate & cocoa aromas mix with fresh cinnamon & vanilla.  Woodsy & nutty oak provide some earthy aromas.  Notes of habanero skin provide a slight burn on the nose to close it out
T- deep cocoa and dark chocolate flavors up front give way to a blast of fresh cinnamon.  Underlying notes of vanilla and oak are complimentary to the cocoa and cinnamon.  Some sweet notes of heavy cream kick in, before finishing with that habanero flavor and leaving just enough heat from the habanero to produce a lingering burn on the palate 
M- medium body with low carbonation leads to a creamy mouthfeel that continues into the finish, leaving heat on the palate 
O- this one matches up there with the best of them when it comes to this style of stout.  Many attempts at this style leaves too much pepper heat, often overpowering the other adjuncts.  This isn't the case here, everything is well balanced and a pleasure to sip 1,123 charactersTreyliff, Nov 06, 2015

The nose is very heavy on the hazelnut and spices (in a good way).  The taste is a little all over the place, hard to pin down what's going on.  The finish is quite smooth, full and creamy.  This needs to come together a bit to really be awesome, some time should probably do the trick. 337 charactersmrn1ceguy, Oct 15, 2015

Other reviewers complained that the pepper flavor at the end was not enough, but to me it was too strong and erased all of the other great flavors going on. Still a great beer, but I won't buy it again at the very high price and will stick with Oil of Aphrodite. 400 charactersDeFaz, Oct 12, 2015

Taste plenty of cinnamon, cocoa & hint of vanilla, habanero finish, but the peppers are not overpowering.

On the tongue, the chocolate is initially sweet, but is quickly ushered aside by earthy, toasted nuts and the acidic roast of coffee bean. Traces of vanilla and spicy hops add depth to the continuing cinnamon and habañero burn. People can lose their minds over Cigar City Hunahpu, but this is right there with it, and much easier to come by. 446 charactersbigbluebeerguy, Sep 23, 2015

4.38/5  rDev -1.6%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Thanks to fiver29 for this bottle which he just handed me, unprovoked, during a hotel-room encounter. Hot! 375ML bottle with a reclining Mayan woman, with headdress. Drinking it in a...hotel room. I’m sure that means something. 
The pour looks just like Oil of Aphrodite (really; go look it up). Smells a bit like cookies baking, with a heavy load of cinnamon with a side of chile  heat. Tad of sweetness that could be cocoa or malt or the remnants of my lunch brownie. Good, either way. 
Oro Negro hints at heat but delivers the smoothness of a freshly shaved armpit. Like a silky nightie melted into liquid form, this slides like a well-crafted porter. Then comes the adjuncts. Cinnamon is chased by the heat, which is subtle & slow-building. Mid-palate sweetness cuts both in quarters; I wouldn’t taste the cocoa if I hadn’t read the word, but knowing, I can tease it out of the more general maltiness. Bare nut browns on the end, really no vanilla to speak of, but who cares? Habenero runs the string out. Stupidly drinkable. Glad I didn’t split this with my wife (don’t tell her, please?). 
Remarkably tasty, remarkably drinkable, remarkably remarkable. Huna? Maybe not quite, but damn, you could put this on the same shelf & it wouldn’t be ashamed. Excellent beer that’s can almost reach out & touch the top tier. 1,336 charactersmaximum12, Sep 02, 2015

If you get your hands on one of these try to drink as it warms, the flavor profile changes dramatically as temps rise and the peak is right before it hits room temps.  If you get a chance to snag some bottles make sure to do so, would be great to do a head to head between this and Bomb or Mexican Cake. 441 charactersBuckeyeBeers, Aug 31, 2015

Pours a pitch black color like all the other Jackie O's Stouts.
The aroma is very cinnamon forward with a hint of the habanero spice, dark chocolate and roast follow with a nice nutty quality.
Taste follows the nose with cinnamon being the dominant taste followed by dark, fudgy chocolate, subtle vanilla, hint of walnuts and ends with a subtle, but building habanero heat. Don't detect the oak staves at all.
Slightly less than full bodied and hides the alcohol very well. Similar to Xocoveza from Stone. 550 charactersJohnnyMc, Aug 27, 2015

Look - Head was slow to develop with this one. It did dissipate quickly from a half finger of tan head. I don't even want to say there is a ring left, nothing. No lacing except for a few errant bubbles. Oily black body. 
Smell - Ginger bread. Chocolate. Cinnamon. Chocolate. Coffee. 
Taste - Nutty. Gingerbread. Vanilla. Chocolate. Spicy finish. Cinnamon more so than peppers.
Feel - Heavy. Spiciness on tongue. Carbonation is accented with spice on swallow. 
Overall - I finally have it, a stout with enough spice that is not overpowering. I still want Evil Twin Jesus with Peppers. Cinnamon over peppers in this one. Gingerbread stout. 716 charactersmadelfonatree, Aug 25, 2015

Aroma is amazing, chai tea, possibly a sweeter chai tea, definitely get the mexican spice stout. Very deep and rich but possibly the best smelling mexican spiced stout I've ever come across. 
Tastes creamy, so creamy and filled with vanilla - the spices are huge, lots of throat coating spice lingers after but it's completely welcomed. 
Big bold medium/full body nothing to complain about here.

A - Black, with just a thin mocha colored head
S - Strong chocolate/cacao smell at first and then started to pick up the cinnamon more strongly towards the end
T - Little bit of everything.  Cacao and cinnamon at first but then the heat/spiciness of the habanero on the back .  Spice was nicely integrated and did not overpower the beer, just left a little kick on the back of the tongue.
M - Not much carbonation but still a little more than I expected for an imperial stout.  Could've been smoother.
O - Complex flavors that complement and balance each other nicely.  Great effort out of Jackie O's and a beer that I would certainly recommend trying. 698 charactersSHDoyle, Aug 23, 2015

M - Mouthfeel is nicely carbonated, alcohol is hidden super nicely.

Perfectly spicy, too, best use of habenero Ive ever tasted in beer. All the other flavors are more in the background but compliment it well.

This one pours a dark, deep black, with a small mocha-colored head, and a little bit of lacing.
Smells awesome, roasty malt, cinnamon, bit of spicy pepper, and lots of fudgy chocolate.
This is seriously a killer beer- nearly a Huna killer, but not quite there. There's a nice bitter fudgy chocolate flavor up front, that gives way to sweet cinnamon, spicy peppers, and walnuts. There's some caramel and a lot of roasted malt as well. The strongest flavors are the chocolate, cinnamon, and walnuts, with the peppers in a subtle supporting role- just enough to know they're there, but not enough to blast you with heat.
This is pretty thick bodied, not overly so, though- with a lower level of carbonation, and a creamy mouthfeel.
I got to try this one at EBF a few months ago, but it was late in the day, so it's nice to get a chance to try this one clean. 905 charactersGreesyFizeek, Aug 12, 2015

S: cinnamon and cocoa nibs most dominant, with some walnuts and peppers underneath.   Vanilla is scarce here. 
T: Vanilla and cinnamon come first before some dark, nearly raw cocoa, and moderate nuts, while the finish brings up just enough chili to live  things up. 
M: probably a bit too carbed (maybe the keg?) and feels a bit lighter than it should, but that also makes it easier drinking than it has any business being. 
O: a fine chili stout: better than all but Cake IMHO. 567 charactersBugs318, Aug 11, 2015

The cinnamon hits first in the taste then makes room for the cocoa with dark roasted coffee char and vanilla. It fades and the peppers light it up gently. They aren't overwhelming like when I've had bomb before or even cake. The flavors meld together and you get them all with each sip. Mouthfeel is right on par for the style. 
I would take this over Cake or Bomb any day. 463 charactersOhiovania, Aug 11, 2015

The cinnamon taste matches the aroma. Not overpowering, but very prominent. The rich chocolate and roasted walnut from the base Oil of Aphrodite is still there along with some pepper heat and flavor. The spicyness isn't in your face, but it does continue to build and lets you know it's there in the end. My mother was drinking it with me and mentioned that it tasted like a spiced cookie. I think it is becasue the cinnamon and spices balance each other out so nicely that it almost comes across like cloves. That and the molasses do make it taste like a cookie batter. 
Body is full and velvety. Alcohol is completely masked. 
If you do not care for cinnamon, or chili/habenero peppers, this won't be for you. While the spices are perfectly blended to me, they are quite noticeable. I find that Bomb! is a little more subtle in this area, but heavier on the vanilla. In my opinion, this one is closer to Xocoveza and Hunahpu for comparrison. Jackie O's not only continues to meet the hype, they seem to raise the bar with each bottle release. 1,122 charactersWesMantooth, Aug 09, 2015

Signature "nutted" JO's imperial stout with a great blend of heat / cinnamon. This absolutely holds it's own against the hype trains for the style.

4.81/5  rDev +8.1%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Poured into a Jackie O's snifter. This beer is pitch black with a very thin dark tan head. The head dissipates quickly. The nose is heavy on the cinnamon and is heavenly. There are notes of chocolate and vanilla as well. It is honestly perfect. The taste starts out cinnamon focused, quickly moves to dark chocolate, a touch of nuttiness and vanilla and then the heat from the peppers takes over and lingers. It's not overly hot, but it sticks around on the palate. Overall, this is an amazing beer that I could go back to over and over again. Looking forward to many more. 573 characterszimm421, Aug 08, 2015

All of their 375ml bottles are always very classy looking. Pours a deep dark brown. Lots of chocolate and spices on the nose. The cinnamon, vanilla, and slight heat from habaneros are very prevalent in the taste. Coats the mouth and leaves a nice cinnamon/habanero heat tingle. Really opened up as it warmed. Overall an outstanding brew and maybe Jackie O's best. 447 charactersburkat, Aug 07, 2015
4.25/5  rDev -4.5%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25For just that moment the the indecision hits- Mexican hot chocolate or imperial stout? Jackie O's brewpub has a beer in mind for just that occasion. Its deep and lavish stout flavors are expounded by a host of spice, oak and peppers.
Oro Negra opens with the deepest of dark brown hues before turning black. Its deep and saturating hues shed a blanketed mocha-stained froth on the rim while its rich perfume of cinnamon and pepper tingle the nose as the roastiness of dark coffee and cocoa sooth the senses. Its initial taste is lush with black-strap molasses, burnt caramel, brown sugar and dark chocolate.
Waves of flavors wash over the middle palate as those robust malt sweetnesses slather the tastebuds with those maple, molasses and wonderfully seared sugars. Its viscous backbone supports the sweetness with a creamy and plush texture to rein in the subtle oak spices, vanilla and walnut nuances. Yet the aura of cinnamon and capsaicin slice and dice the sweetness and ushers in a unique and piquant spicy, waring sensation throughout.
Its full body is satisfying, creamy, silky and smooth but not chewy or cloying. As the roasty sweetness fades into a long and lingering afterglow, the spices of cinnamon and habernero command the finish with their simmering warmth. Alcohol and wood spices provide a slight medicinal warmth to assist as the beer develops a malty-sweet but drying finish. 1,399 charactersBEERchitect, Aug 06, 2015

Smell is a gorgeous mix of chocolate and spice. Flavor is insanely complex, with lots of chocolate, and hints of vanilla, cinnamon, molasses, and oak. The heat is not overpowering, but certainly present, which allows it to complement the other flavors, rather than dominate the experience, as is the case with many other beers in this style. The mouthfeel is medium carbonation, and a hint of a bite provided by the spice. Overall, this is almost a perfect beer, and one of my favorites of all time. 581 charactersStefko, Aug 01, 2015

I must say do not drink this beer cold, once it warmed up it was one of the best in the style. Slightly thinner than huna or bomb but had better cinnamon and chocolate flavors with the perfect amount of heat. Jackie o's is quickly becoming not only the best in the state but one of the best breweries in the nation. 366 charactersMshull, Aug 01, 2015

It's somewhat nutty, very heavy on dark chocolate and the cinnamon spice  bitter chocolate and I can pick up the pepper heat in the smell. Oaky as well.  The flavor is surprisingly short in sweetness. It's bitter with roast and dark chocolate. Dry nuts, powdered cinnamon, drying oak and a pretty impressive peppery heat. Too much heat for me, but it's hard to tell from the small sample. Thick bodied. Similar set up to Hunahpu by Cigar City (which I sampled right before this) but this one is not as sweet and I think the heat is dialed up a few more notches. 671 charactersVelvetExtract, Mar 22, 2015

4.94/5  rDev +11%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Had at the anniversary weekend party.. To say this beer is phenomenal is an understatement.. Far and away the best peppered stout I have ever had.. Delicious sweet, full bodied beer that slowly gives way to a slow burn from the peppers but never over the top to the point of ruining the taste palate.. I would absolutely love to see this bottled.. I would travel there in a heart beat to get some.. Not sure how often it is seen but if you do run into it, try it for sure... 474 characterskingston2, Feb 05, 2015

5/5  rDev +12.4%I will start by saying this is a top 5 beer ever for me. I think it puts every other Mexican stout to shame. 
The flavor starts with sweet cinnamon, slowly transitions into a vanilla flavor with a chai kick. Then the heat starts to build, and just as you think it is going to be too much the heat just stops. The balance of this beer is off the charts. I really hope they bottle this in the future. 399 charactersnoslenwerd, Dec 16, 2014
